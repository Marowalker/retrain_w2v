These days, there is a need to develop novel and emerging
processing pathways that permit production of value-added substances
and fuels considering sustainability aspects. In this sense, levulinic
acid (LA) is one of the most promising biorefinery products. This
paper presents environmental and safety assessments of LA production
via acid-catalyzed dehydration (ACD) of biomass. The process was modeled
by using Aspen Plus process simulation software based on a capacity
of 132 000 tons per annum of banana rachis (main raw material).
Likewise, environmental and safety assessments were developed. Parameters
such as heats of reaction, explosivity, toxicity of substances, and
operational conditions along with extended mass and energy balances
were used to perform safety and environmental analyses. In this regard,
the modeled topology showed an inherent safety index (ISI) score of
24 with an equal contribution of 12 points for both chemical inherent
safety index (CIS) and process inherent safety index (PIS). ACD showed
a good safety performance, with moderate concerns related to the handling
of formic acid. Moreover, the waste reduction algorithm (WAR) was
used to assess environmental performance and estimate potential environmental
impacts (PEIs) of the simulated topology. It was performed considering
four case studies to determine the influence of mass streams (case
1), product streams (case 2), energy streams (case 3), and simultaneous
products and energy contribution (case 4). This analysis showed that
for this process, the total inletting flow of impacts that enter was
less than the amount of these that leave the system according to a
generation rate of the PEI for case 1 (−1.89 × 102 PEI/h) and case 3 (−1.83 × 102 PEI/h).
From the environmental viewpoint, the major concern is associated
with the photochemical oxidation potential category because of the
handling of volatile organic compounds through the process.

Introduction
The environmental implications related
to the use of fossil energy sources generate one of the major concerns
of modern scientific society. During the last 50 years of 20th century,
it is estimated that CO2 emissions substantially increased.
This fact has impacted in such a way that the Earth has suffered the
effects of climate change, holes in the ozone layer, and acid rain,
among others.1 In Colombia, it is well-known
that some effects associated with the climatic change has generated
problems of shortages and increased in the family basket prices. It
has affected the agroindustry production over this country.2 Therefore, the development of sustainable chemical
processes and cleaner production are emerging as a crucial concept
for generating design alternatives in order to decrease the dependence
of fossil fuels and also to promote better use of the natural resources.3 Levulinic acid (LA) is a promising product in
biorefinery processing. This substance is obtained through rehydration
of 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF) which is a key component in the
acid-catalyzed dehydration (ACD) process. Also, formic acid is formed
as a coproduct of this reaction. HMF is extracted/produced from lignocellulosic
biomass through prehydrolysis/hydrolysis stage.4 LA has attracted a lot of interest because of its high
market value and as an important intermediate for generation of substances
for application in fuel additives, solvents, and plasticizers, among
others.5

Environmental assessment
allows evaluating suitable processing routes for chemical, physical,
or biochemical processes. There are many studies describing the role
of environmental assessment of promising/emerging processing technologies
as a decision-making tool. Patel et al.6 performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) of algal hydrothermal liquefaction
to assess environmental impacts for biocrude production for a variety
of scenarios, reporting that the modeled cultivation and hydrothermal
liquefaction technology represented about 90% of the total environmental
charges emitted by this process. DeRose et al.7 assessed the production of renewable fuels from low lipid algae
with the aim of selecting the processing route with the best economic
and environmental performance. Meramo-Hurtado et al.8 developed a computer-aided environmental assessment of
a biorefinery for hydrogen production via a biomass gasification process.
This research presented the evaluation of different purification stages
for product extraction. Moreno-Sader et al.9 used environmental analysis
(along with exergy analysis) for selecting bio-oil feedstock and processing
pathways through computer-aided tools. Otherwise, environmental assessment
was applied to assess processing alternatives for ethylene production
compared to biochemical and fossil-based pathways.10 Hernández et al.11 assessed
an olive stone biorefinery based on technoeconomic and environmental
assessment. Both analyses allowed screening the best design for this
case study.

Another important aspect that should be taken into
consideration in process design is the evaluation of industrial safety.
A variety of methods and indicators are proposed in the literature
to evaluate safety performance of chemical processes. Heikkila12 mentioned that the Dow Fire and Explosion Index
(Dow F&EI) is one of the most widely used methods in chemical
industry processes, although indicators such as the prototype index
of inherent safety and the inherent safety index (ISI) are also implemented.
Kidam et al.13 discussed different approaches
for the evaluation of inherent safety by index methods. Moreover,
several studies have addressed process evaluation of existing and
emerging technologies based on safety assessment. Thiruvenkataswamy
et al.14 developed a safety and technoeconomic
analysis of ethylene production technologies. Rathnayaka et al.15 presented a methodology for decision-making
in the design and analysis of chemical processes considering safety
parameters. The proposed metric incorporated a novel parameter for
quantifying the reduction of consequences and probability of accident
occurrence through inherent safety optimization. Quddus et al.16 developed a risk assessment of class 3 for hazardous
materials in transportation. Otherwise, Song et al.17 presented a novel framework and method for assessing inherent
process safety into a conceptual design of chemical processes. As
described, environmental and safety analyses are relevant methodologies
and metrics widely applied to evaluate and screen suitable chemical
processes considering sustainability. Thus, this study presents an
environmental and safety assessment, by using the Waste Reduction
Algorithm (WAR) and the ISI of synthesis of LA from lignocellulosic
biomass via ACD. Technical data required to perform such process analyses
were provided by modeling of the proposed topology.

Results and Discussion
The chemical composition of
banana rachis assumed in this study is summarized in Table 1. This raw material is classified
as lignocellulosic biomass, so the lignin and hemicellulose contents
of these substances are slightly higher compared to those of other
biomass sources. This chemical composition was taken from the data
reported by Igbinadolor and Onilude.18 Due
to its chemical structure and concentration of constituent substances,
pretreatment and prehydrolysis stages are required to increase sugar
production yields. Therefore, such sugar extraction methods become
into crucial stages in order to obtain required concentration of pentoses
(C5) and hexoses (C6), and these units should be extremely efficient.

Simulation of LA Production via ACD
The process flowsheet
diagram of the ACD pathway for LA production is given in Figure 1. Operational parameters
such as pressure, temperature, mass fractions, and main process flows
are summarized in Table 2. This proposed process is comprised of three main units: acid pretreatment
(PT), acid dehydration reaction (AC), and distillation (DT). PT-1
represents the feed flow of banana rachis (main raw material), at
this stage, feedstock is assumed to be already washed and milled.
It is sent to a tank for mixing with H2SO4.
This solid–liquid mixture is preheated by a heat exchange unit
for reaching optimal temperature conditions before entering the pretreatment
reactor. In this stage, 7% of glucan (cellulose) is hydrolyzed to
form glucose, while 90% of hemicellulose is converted into xylose.
Likewise, 5% of lignin is further solubilized. The other C5 carbohydrates
(arabinan, mannan, and galactan) present in the biomass structure
are assumed to be hydrolyzed under the same conditions as hemicellulose.19 The process uses a flash separation unit, where
huge amounts of water and impurities are removed from the main stream.
Because of the presence of H2SO4, the flow is
sent to ion-exchange and over-liming units in order to decrease the
pH of the mixture. Following this, solids and liquids are separated
by a hydrocyclone process; this stage divides the flow between cellulose
(PT-23) and xylose (PT-24). Solubilized xylose and cellulose are separated
to avoid inhibitory effects and decrease in the conversion rates of
glucose formation in an enzymic hydrolysis unit.20 The cellulose flow is sent to a hydrolysis unit for hexose
production, while the pentose stream is sent to an ion-exchange unit
followed by an over-liming stage for removal of impurities. Finally,
extracted pentoses are directly sent to the acid-catalyzed reactor
unit.

In the AC unit, the cellulose stream is used for C6
production via a hydrolysis reaction. This stage is performed through
cellulase enzyme. The biological reactor operates at 30 °C and
1 atm pressure. Cellulase enzyme is assumed to be a group of coenzymes,
which are composed of endoglucanases for polymer size reduction, exoglucanases
for chemical hydrolysis, and b-glucosidase for cellobiose hydrolysis
to produce glucose.21 The main chemical
reaction of enzyme hydrolysis and the mass fraction yield to product
(FYP) are shown in eq 1. 1  

Both glucose and pentose flows are
delignified before the ACD reaction, which is developed to avoid inhibitory
reactions, and it is commonly accomplished by using a precipitator
agent. These streams are mixed and subsequently sent to a dehydration
reactor for LA production. The acid-catalyzed system is comprised
of two reactor stages. In the first one, glucose is converted into
HMF in a plug-flow reactor which operates at 210 °C and 24.67
atm. The main stream, containing the reducing sugars, is mixed with
the catalyst (H2SO4) before entering the system.
The second step is developed in a back-mix reactor which operates
at 180 °C and 14.1 atm pressure. In this unit, HMF obtained in
the first reactor, which is subsequently dehydrated to form LA and
formic acid. Besides, xylose is also transformed into furfural.22,23 The reactions and FYP of this system24 are shown in eqs 2 and 3. 2   3  

LA was obtained at 35.64 % wt, in the
outlet reactor stream (AC-17). Therefore, in order to synthesize a
product with commercial purity, the main flow is sent to a purification
stage. This unit is composed of two distillation towers. In the first
column, organic volatile compounds such as formic acid and furfural
are removed from the LA mixture. It is worth mentioning that this
design just considered generation of LA as the main product; therefore,
if the biorefinery concept is applied, such byproducts can be potentially
purified by using solvent extraction methods.25 This process topology could produce three main products becoming
into a biorefinery.26 Otherwise, LA is
obtained from the bottoms of the second column at 98.5 % wt. Finally,
the main product is cooled to 28 °C and sent to storage [see
DT-09]. A total flow of 38 392 TPA of LA was produced which
represents a global feedstock to product yield of 29.10%.

Environmental Assessment of the ACD Process
For the
modeled ACD process, environmental assessment was implemented based
on the WAR. Extended material and energy balances obtained from process
simulations permit estimating the potential environmental impacts
(PEIs) for this process. Figure 2 shows the output and generated rate of the PEI for
this case study. Results revealed that through this evaluated ACD
topology, the amount of outlet impact is less than the quantities
of these that enter the process. Negative values were obtained for
generation rates of the PEI for case 1 and case 3, which report −1.89
× 102 and −1.83 × 102 PEI/h,
respectively. Otherwise, cases 2 and 4 showed a generation rate of
1.67 and 8.01 PEI/h, respectively. This indicates that the main product
stream influences the environmental performance of this design. From
a global viewpoint, this process has an environmentally friendly performance. Figure 3 displays toxicological
impacts generated and the output rate of the PEI for modeled synthesis
of LA. The output rate of the PEI for human toxicity by ingestion
(HTPI), human toxicity by dermal exposure (HTPE), and terrestrial
toxicity potential (TTP) categories is moderate for all cases, while
the aquatic toxicity potential (ATP) category remains in low values.
The abovementioned finding implies that the potential effects generated
by this process on aquatic systems are small.

Figure 2 Rates of the PEI for
toxicological categories.

Figure 3 Rates of the PEI for atmospheric categories.

Figure 5 shows the performance of atmospheric impact categories evaluated
for this case study. This analysis is developed assessing global categories:
global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP);
regional categories: acidification potential (AP) and photochemical
oxidation potential (PCOP). Atmospheric analysis shows that LA synthesis
does not present important environmental concerns related to potential
atmospheric/air pollution. For each evaluated case, PCOP was the most
impacted atmospheric category. The abovementioned fact can be related
to the use of organic compounds with concerns related to their volatility
and chemical affinity with ethene which is the reference used to evaluated
the PCOP category.

Safety Assessment of the ACD Process
ISI estimation
was developed assuming the worst possible condition for each assessed
subindex. This allows evaluation of unknown situations as the maximum
associated risks that can be generated within a system. The inherent
safety subindex for chemical substances was measured by eq 4.

The first and second terms
in eq 4 are the enthalpy
of formation of main and side reactions. These parameters in eq 4 are associated to measure
the exothermic grade of reaction systems. For this process, main and
side reactions were found in the ACD reaction. Table 3 shows safety subindexes by chemical reactions
for this case study.

Irmmax	0	main reaction is endothermic	
Irsmax	1	side reaction is slightly exothermic	
a Values estimated by authors.

Iintmax refers
to those chemical interactions derived from unwanted reactions between
substances and materials in the plant area. For this case, the worst
interaction is presented in the main reactor, with the mixture formed
by formic acid and furfural. These substances have concerns according
to the toxicological information available for such components. This
criterion is evaluated based on the reported threshold limit value
(TLV) for each dangerous substance. Thus, unexpected chemical interactions
related to this potentially risky mixture are set for this system.
Therefore, an Iintmax = 2 is
assigned. An overall safety subindex for measuring dangerous chemical
substances (Ifl + Iex + Itox)max is developed
to quantify potential inherent risk associated with flammability,
explosivity, and toxicity of chemical substances. In the case of this
process, sulfuric acid, furfural, and formic acid were identified
as the most dangerous compounds. Table 4 shows the results for the dangerous substance safety
index. 4

According to the properties reported in Table 4, it is worth mentioning that
the assessed dangerous substances present a similar performance in
their properties. In the case of flammability, sulfuric acid was assigned
with an Ifla = 0, given the nonflammable
feature of this substance. Otherwise, for furfural and formic acid,
almost the same flash point is reported which ranges between 60 and
70 °C for both components. Toxicity for all three substances
is quite similar considering reported TLVs for each of these. In terms
of explosivity, the main difference between these substances is associated
with formic acid that is a moderate explosive substance,27 while furfural and sulfuric acid are not. For
an overall evaluation of dangerous substance subindex, formic acid
obtained the highest score. On the other hand, the corrosivity subindex
evaluates the required construction material according to handling
needs of substances. This parameter is directly related to the equipment
safety subindex; therefore, it was established considering the requirements
for equipment and processing units of the ACD process. This was done
according to operational conditions and extended mass and energy balances
obtained by simulation, along with the process flowsheet diagram displayed
in Figure 1. Table 5 shows a description
of main equipment used for the the production process of LA. For this
case study, corrosive substances such as formic acid, NaOH, or sulfuric
acid are involved in different processing stages. Likewise, stainless
steel (SS) is the most common material used for construction among
evaluated equipment, with a use of approximately 72%. They suggest that acids and alkalis at diffeternt concentrations can
be handled at various stages of this process.30 Moreover, for a pretreatment reactor, Hastelloy c-200 was selected
(along with SS), this alloy is composed of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum,
and it is recommended for handling sulfuric acid.31 Therefore, it was also assumed that this is the material
used for ACD reactors, although it is important to mention that glass-based
materials are also widely used for H2SO4 handling.31 According to the abovementioned result, an Icormax = 2 was assigned taking into
account that special materials such as Hastelloy, polypropylene (PP),
epoxy lined, and resin-lined (RS-L) are required for some process
equipment. All parameters needed for chemical substance safety calculation
were determined; therefore, eq 4 was solved obtaining an Ich =
12.

The second step of ISI calculation is related to the
evaluation of the process inherent safety index. This parameter is
measured by eq 5. The
estimation of the PIS requires the knowledge of the operational conditions
of the process because this metric considers maximum stress points
through the system. 5  

The first term in eq 5 is the inventory of the plant, this parameter
measures the mass contained in any process equipment (tanks, reactor,
and mixers, among others) for a hydraulic retention time of 1 h. In
this plant equipment, reactors, tanks, separators, or heat exchangers
were simulated. From a global viewpoint, a total inventory of 285
tones was calculated for the inside battery limits (ISBL). In this
case, the outside battery limits (OSBL) were not considered because
it was assumed that the main processing units belong to ISBL. This
result represents a II = 4, which means
that this system handles with great amounts of mass representing a
stressing factor for the equipment and general safety of the plant.
The maximum temperature in this process was found in the AC unit,
specifically in the first reactor which is operated at 210 °C.
Also, the maximum operational pressure (24.67 atm) for this unit was
found. Table 6 shows
the safety subindexes for inventory, temperature, and pressure estimated
for this system.

Table 6 Safety Subindexes for II, ITmax and IPmax
indicator	criteria	score	
II	based on the inventory for ISBL	4	
ITmax	based on the maximum temperature
of the process	2	
IPmax	based on the maximum pressure of the process	1	
Another important parameter for process inherent safety
calculation is the equipment safety subindex. The ISBL of
the process represent an important number of equipment such as reactors,
bombs, heat exchangers, storage tanks, separators, and filters, among
others that for itself setting and design have intrinsic risks associated
with the operations. This system considers the design of process units
as storage tanks, filters, separators, ionic exchangers, distillation
columns, reactors, and heat exchangers, among others. Based on equipment
described above and features reported in Table 5, IEQ is assigned
according to the potential risks associated with the most dangerous
operational equipment. In this case, the severity
of pressure and temperature, and the specific purpose of each processing
unit, pretreatment, and the ACD reactor along with distillation towers
are identified as the riskiest equipment obtaining an IEQ = 3.32

Finally, a
secure structure subindex was estimated. This parameter is determined
considering historical data and reports from heuristics and engineering
experience of well-known processes. Yan et al.33 reported that ACD is a process just developed under the
semi-industrial scale through a recognized operation named “Biofine
process”. Therefore, this simulation was developed setting
a large-scale processing capacity, but according to historical data
reported for ACD, it is assigned as ISTmax = 2. This value refers to novel or emerging large-scale
processes.

Globally, the ISI can be evaluated through subindexes
calculated in this case study. Table 7 shows the ISI subindexes estimated for the ACD process.
A global score of 24 was obtained with an equal contribution of 12
points for the CIS and PSI. The abovementioned result indicates that
this process has a balanced performance for both safety categories,
in fact operational conditions and thermodynamics of the reactions
do not represent mayors concerns for the inherent safety of this process.
Heikkila12 suggested that for a typical
or neutral safety performance of a chemical processing, an ISI score
equal or below to 24 is generally reported. Considering above, this
case study showed a total ISI equal to the recommended standard; thus,
the modeled design for ACD exhibited a neutral safety performance.

Conclusions
This study presented an environmental and
safety assessment for a large-scale ACD process. Results revealed
that this process showed a balanced performance for chemical and process
safety inherent indexes. Specifically, it was determined a score of
12 for both chemical substances and process inherent safety. Likewise,
the ACD pathway for LA production from banana rachis showed an ISI
performance within the recommended safety standards. The abovementioned
fact might be an important finding because this analysis allowed establishing
that this process (at large scale) is safe compared to the reference
value. Otherwise, application of the WAR confirmed that the modeled
process topology has an environmentally friendly performance, and
even consumption rates of PEI for case 1 and case 3 were obtained.
The abovementioned result indicates that environmental impacts regarding
process energy sources do not affect the overall performance of the
plant for both atmospheric and toxicological categories. Globally,
PCOP was the most impacted atmospheric category, and this is explained
by the presence of volatile organic compounds through the process.
For future work is recommended to consider the evaluation of the presented
ACD topology based on economic and energy parameters in order to get
a wider vision in sustainability terms. Also, the application of the
biorefinery concept which would consider commercial production of
formic acid and furfural as products could be interesting for generation
of performance comparisons.

Methodology
In this study, banana rachis is used as
a precursor to produce LA via ACD. This chemical substance can be
formed from different routes such as organic synthesis, reducing sugars
synthesis, and direct furfuryl alcohol conversion.5 The process design is performed through a computer-aided
process engineering approach which requires process information such
as material/energy balances, temperature and pressure conditions of
each unit, and reactions yields, among others. The technical data
required to perform process simulation are taken from the literature.34,35 Process modeling and simulation allow obtaining extended energy
and mass balances, mixing properties, and heats of reaction under
defined process conditions and stages. These parameters are required
to perform environmental and safety assessments of the process. Finally,
such analyses are developed to diagnose potential improvement opportunities
with the aim of screening a most suitable and sustainable design. Figure 4 shows the step-wise
methodology applied for the evaluation of the ACD pathway for LA production.

Process Simulation
Process simulation and modeling
require selecting chemical substances, an adequate thermodynamic model
and state equation(s), setting processing capacity, and establishing
input conditions such as mass and energy flows, temperature, pressure,
reaction yields, and stoichiometry, among others.36 In order to develop the simulation of the proposed ACD
pathway for LA production, Aspen Plus software was selected. This
computer-aided tool is widely used for simulation of existing and
emerging chemical processes. This software has several components
and substances incorporated in its enterprise database, so the majority
of the needed compounds are available. For those components which
do not exist in software database, authors used Aspen Property Estimator
to create and estimate the physical–chemical properties of
such components in the software. Most of the chemical and physical
properties of these substances were obtained from the literature.37 Aspen Plus requires introducing component properties
such as boiling and melting points, molecular weight, thermodynamic
properties, critical properties, and free energy of formation, among
others. Nonrandom two liquids (NRTLs) were chosen as the thermodynamic-base
model for process simulation and modeling according to their real
representativeness for the estimation of polar/nonpolar mixtures and
thermodynamic equilibriums.38

Production of LA via ACD of Banana Rachis
As described,
there are two main ways to produce LA at the semi-industrial scale,
the first is the organic pathway and the second is the acid-catalyzed
pathway. The proposed process was developed based on the second route.
The ACD reaction is the base technology for the production of LA proposed
in this study. A processing capacity of 132 000 TPA of banana
rachis was set as the mass inlet flow. This parameter was established
according to the local availability of these residues in the north
of Colombia. Lignocellulosic biomass has to be hydrolyzed in order
to increase the availability of reducing sugars (C5 and C6) contained
in the raw material structure. Therefore, the acid pretreatment stage
was simulated considering operational conditions reported by Wooley
et al.19 After C6 and C5 extraction, the
process uses the acid dehydration reactor. This stage is performed
by using H2SO4 (1 M) as the acid catalyst according
to experimental conditions and performances reported by Girisuta39 and Kang et al.23 Xylose and glucose flows are mixed along with the acid catalyst,
for producing LA (from glucose dehydration), along with formic acid
and furfural (from xylose dehydration) as byproducts.40

LA is produced from glucose in a reaction mechanism
involving dehydration of a six carbon sugar to HMF. 5-Hydroxymethyl
furfural which is subsequently rehydrated forming LA along with formic
acid. On the other hand, xylose is dehydrated to form furfural. The
reaction scheme for LA production is shown in Figure 5. The outlet reaction flow is sent to a cooling unit for reaching
30 °C. Thus, the cooled flow is sent to the purification stage
which is composed of two distillation towers where LA is extracted,
from the bottom of the second column, at a concentration of 98.5 %
wt.41

Environmental Assessment
Several methodologies and
tools to evaluate environmental performance and estimate impact assessment
of emerging and existing technologies are reported in the literature.
The LCA and Eco-Indicator 99, among others, are widely applied for
this purpose.42 The WAR is widely applied
to develop environmental analysis by the estimation of potential impacts
for the ACD pathway for producing LA from lignocellulosic biomass.
The WAR method was developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), this tool allows evaluating process alternatives by the assessment
of eight environmental impact categories. These parameters are classified
into toxicological and atmospheric aspects.43 Toxicological categories are HTPI, HTPE, ATP, and TTP, while atmospheric
categories involve evaluating parameters such as GWP, ODP, PCOP, and
AP.44 The output rate of the PEI is calculated
by using eq 6, while
the total mass output rate is calculated by using eq 7. The total generation rate of the
PEI is estimated by using eq 8, and the total mass generation rate is determined by using eq 9. Therefore, iout(cp) and iin(cp) are the rate of the PEI exiting and entering the evaluated process
because of chemical exchanges within the process, respectively. iout(ep) and iin(ep) are the rate of PEI leaving and entering
the process associated to energy generation within the process, while iwe(ep) and iwe(cp) are the PEI leaving the process as a consequence
of the release of waste energy associated to energy generation and
chemical stages within the process. Mj(in) and Mj(out) are the input and output mass flow
of the stream j, Xk is the mass fraction of a component k in
the stream j, ψk is the overall PEI of chemical k, and PP is the mass flow rate of the product P.31Figure 6 displays the diagram for balance of the
PEI for a chemical process taking into account the contribution of
energy generation. Such WAR equations (see eqs 6–9) are explained
by the interactions45 described in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Balance diagram for estimation
of the PEI by using the WAR.

The environmental assessment of LA production via
ACD was performed from four case studies in order to determine the
influence of energy and product streams into the output and generation
rates of PEI for this process. The abovementioned fact allows determining
improvement opportunities regarding energy consumption and these derived
effects for a random discharge of substances (such as the product)
into the environment. Likewise, case 1 is formulated considering only
mass streams without product contributions. Case 2 considers mass
and product streams without energy contribution. Case 3 is based on
case 1 but taking into account energy streams. Finally, case 4 considers
both energy and product stream contribution along with all mass flows.
The combination of global impact assessment, impacts by category,
and analysis of effect derived from energy flows and sources allowed
obtaining a holistic diagnosis of the modeled process from the environmental
viewpoint. 6   7   8   9  

Safety Assessment
For unproven processes or adaptations
of existing ones, many of the technical and economic decisions are
strongly oriented by safety factors. Therefore, it is very important
for engineers and designers to consider process safety in order to
evaluate potential risks associated with the development of engineering
projects and also the improvement of existing plants. This allows
taking designs and operational decisions considering the mitigation
of inherent risks of the evaluated process.16 The ISI is a technique used to measure the inherent safety for chemical
processes in conceptual design stages.46 The ISI parameter is calculated by using eq 10 as follows 10  Ich is the inherent
safety sub-index for chemical substances and Ips is the PIS. The global assessment of the ISI is performed
as shown in eq 10, considering
the evaluation of the chemical substances and the process structure.

The first is determined from the contribution of parameters such
as heats of reaction, toxicity, explosivity, and interaction chemistry
of the chemical compounds involved in the process, while the second
is determined from the parameters of the process such as temperature
and maximum pressure, inventory, and process structure, among others. Table 8 shows the score and
symbols for safety parameters.
