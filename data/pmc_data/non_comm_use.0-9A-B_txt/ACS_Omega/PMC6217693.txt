A new approach for
single cell microencapsulation in an oil-in-water
(o/w) Pickering emulsion is presented. The water/paraffin emulsions
were stabilized by amine-functionalized silica nanoparticles. The
droplet size of the emulsions was highly tunable, and ranged from
1 to 30 μm in diameter. The controllable droplet size along
with the high colloidal stability of the Pickering emulsionswas harnessed
to obtain single cell microencapsulation. Successful encapsulation
of the conidia entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium
brunneum by the studied Pickering emulsions was confirmed
via confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting systems were
implemented to develop a novel biopesticide formulation for arthropod
pest control. The conidia incorporated in the emulsions were applied
to Ricinus communis leaves by spray
assay. After drying of the emulsion, a silica-based honeycomb-like
structure with an ordered hierarchical porosity is formed. This structure
preserves the individual cell encapsulation. The successful single
cell encapsulation has led to a high distribution of conidia cells
on the leaves. The Pickering emulsion-based formulation exhibited
significantly higher pest control activity against Spodoptera littoralis larvae compared to the control
systems, thus making it a promising, cost-effective, innovative approach
for tackling the pest control challenge.

==== Body
Introduction
Single cell encapsulation has many major
applications in a wide
variety of fields including medicine, food industry, and agriculture.
Encapsulation protects against harsh external conditions, ensures
lower exposure to contamination by foreign organisms, and provides
improved isolation.1,2 Cell encapsulation has become
an important tool in gene therapy, controlling drug delivery,3 fermentation industry,4 image analysis tool, and genomic analysis in microorganisms.5 The capsule provides synthetic membrane that
will be removed in an appropriate environment. Several techniques
for single cell microencapsulation have been developed, including
solvent evaporation,6 interfacial polymerization,7 and layer-by-layer deposition.8 Nevertheless, these methods may contain toxic chemicals
and compounds such as organic solvents or corrosive surfactants that
constitute risks for biological organisms.9 This underscores the need for fine biocompatible single cell encapsulation
techniques to maintain cell viability for example, hydrogel,10 microfluidic-based methods11 and emulsions.12

Pickering
emulsions, which have been extensively studied and implemented
in numerous applications during the last century, are excellent candidates
for single cell encapsulation, given their high colloidal stability
and controllable droplet size.13−15 Pickering emulsions are stabilized
by nanoparticles (NPs) that are self-assembled at the oil/water interface
and act as a physical barrier.16,17 Pickering emulsions
come in the form of oil-in-water (o/w) or inverse (water-in-oil) emulsions.
Inorganic NPs such as silica, clays, hydroxyapatites, and organic
NPs can act as stabilizers for Pickering emulsions.17 At the interface, the wettability of the particles determines
their localization in the water and the oil phase.18 The diameter of the droplets is dictated by the particle
size and the composition of the system (o/w ratio and NP content).19−21 Cell encapsulation by Pickering emulsions has become useful for
various applications, such as encapsulation of microbial cells to
protect from pH changes,22 developing biopesticide
formulations based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt),23 platform for enzymatic reaction,24,25 cellular capsules based on liquid marbles,26 and encapsulation of adherent cells in water-in-water emulsions
for tissue engineering.27

In recent
years, in response to growing public demands, health
concerns, and new regulations, in addition to the need for increased
food production, synthetic pesticides have been removed from the market.
Biopesticides are low risk, environmental friendly pesticides based
on living microbes. Their active compounds are designed to be a natural
and environmentally safe alternative to the synthetic pesticides used
in crop protection. However, the difficulties in running efficient
field trials and the high cost of biopesticides have prevented them
from making a significant global dent.28 The development of new advanced formulation systems for biopesticides
could thus lead to more efficient pest control, increased shelf life,
and greater persistence in the field.

Entomopathogenic fungi
are biopesticides with a unique mode of
action in that they penetrate the body integument of the host directly.
Most fungus-based biopesticides are ascomycetes belonging to the complex
species Metarhizium and Beauveria.29

The
development of advanced formulations for biopesticides that
can meet the demands for high pest control efficiency is of paramount
importance. These formulations must achieve high functionality under
a range of environmental conditions. This can be done by (1) maximizing
their distribution on the plant canopy, (2) protection against UV,
(3) maintaining microenvironmental humidity control, and (4) increasing
their shelf life.30,31 The microencapsulation of biopesticides
using Pickering emulsions and colloidosomes constitutes an excellent
candidate for tailoring new advanced formulations with high protection
performance. Pickering emulsions make it possible to tune the emulsion
properties in terms of droplet diameter and proper surface functionalization
of the NPs to achieve high activity and a prolonged shelf life of
the incorporated microorganisms. Silica NPs is an eco-friendly32 emulsion stabilizer, which enables the introduction
of additional functionalities to the product, such as UV protection
and humidity control. This can be done by chemical modification of
the silica NPs with organosilanes.

Single microencapsulation
of cells by Pickering emulsion presents
a significant potential for the development of new biopesticide formulations.
The most commonly used myco-biopesticides are conidia. These microorganisms
must remain nongerminated before application in the field; that is,
unexposed to water. This means that conidia must be encapsulated in
the oil phase of the emulsion, which makes encapsulation in the w/o
system impractical. Furthermore, the chemical nature of the outer
surface of most conidia is hydrophobic, resulting in their arrangement
in the oil phase. Hence, developing advanced o/w Pickering emulsions
that can encapsulate conidia in the oil phase is a top priority.

In response to this need, this study presents a new approach for
single encapsulation of conidia by an eco-friendly o/w Pickering emulsion.
The overall process is illustrated in Figure 1. Silica NPs were functionalized by (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES) to introduce amine-functionalized groups onto the NPs (silica-NH2). Pickering emulsions were prepared in different paraffin/water
ratios and at various concentrations of silica NPs (Figure 1a). Metarhizium
brunneumMa7 was the model fungal
strain chosen for this study, as it exhibits a broad spectrum of hosts,
which makes it a suitable strain for commercialization.33−36 The Metarhizium-based products are
registered worldwide.37

The successful single encapsulation
of Metarhizium conidia in the paraffin
droplets (Figure 1b)
was confirmed by confocal laser scanning
microscopy. The hydrophobic outer layer of the conidia, which is critical
for the attachment and germination process on the host surface,38,39 is also responsible for their individual arrangement in the oil
phase. The biopesticide activity of the Metarhizium conidia was assessed on Spodoptera littoralis larvae. The formulation was sprayed on Ricinus communis leaves (Figure 1c)
and exhibited significant pesticidal activity against S. littoralis larvae. These results confirm the high
efficiency of the Pickering emulsion-based formulation developed in
this study.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Silica-NH2 Pickering
Emulsion
Silica NPs were functionalized by APTES through
silanization to introduce
amine groups on the surface of the NPs.40 Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions based on amine-functionalized silica
NPs were prepared. Different contents of amine-functionalized silica
(wt %) and oil/water (vol %) ratios were implemented to determine
the proper conditions for a stable Pickering emulsion system that
would meet the demands of single cell encapsulation. The silica contents
were varied (0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt %) at oil/water ratios of 5:95,
10:90, 20:80, and 30:70, respectively. A major objective of the current
study is to develop an efficient formulation for biopesticides that
will maintain the conidia nongerminated. Therefore, the encapsulation
of the conidia cells in the oil phase is mandatory.

The stability
of the Pickering emulsions was characterized by visual observation
over time. Most of the prepared emulsions were stable for 6–7
months (see Table 1). The highest stability was observed at a silica content of 5 wt
% at oil/water ratios of 20:80 and 30:70, which were stable for more
than a year. However, no emulsification was obtained at a silica content
of 0.1 wt %. For highly stable systems, we used confocal microscopy
to observe changes in the droplet diameter as a result of droplet
coalescence and creaming (data not shown).

Confocal microscopy
images of Pickering emulsions with 1 wt % silica
NPs at different oil/water ratios is depicted in Figure 2. The diameter of the paraffin
droplets are highly tunable and can be varied in a relatively wide
range of 1–30 μm. Figure 2e depicts the paraffin droplet diameter of the emulsions
versus the content of the silica-NH2 NPs at four different
paraffin/water ratios. It is observed that the higher the silica content,
the smaller is the droplet diameter at any studied volume fractions
of paraffin oil. This phenomenon is explained by the increase of the
total surface area of the o/w interface.20 In addition, under a given content of silica-NH2, the
increase of the volume fraction of the paraffin resulted in larger
droplet sizes.20 The tuning of the emulsion
composition enabled us to fine-tune the resulting droplet size, which
is essential for single cell encapsulation. The relatively high stability
of the Pickering emulsion is derived from the low coalescence rate
of the droplets due to the presence of the NPs at the interface.

Single Cell Encapsulation
M. brunneumMa7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) conidia41 were added to the different silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions.
Single cell encapsulation of the conidia in
the paraffin phase of the emulsions was confirmed by confocal microscopy
(Figure 3). The confocal
microscopy images are representing one focal plane, thus the conidia
cells that appear inside the boundaries of the oil droplets are actually
located in the internal part of the paraffin droplets.

Successful single cell encapsulation in the paraffin
oil droplets
was obtained in emulsions with an o/w ratio of 20:80 at three different
silica content values of 2, 3, and 5 wt % (Figure 3). The droplet concentration in these emulsions
is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the conidia cell
concentration, thus very few droplets that host conidia cells could
be detected in a given confocal microscopy image even at very low
magnification. Figure 3 depicts characteristic confocal microscopy images that conclusively
confirm the successful single cell encapsulation of the conidia cells
in the paraffin droplets of the emulsions.

The Pickering emulsions
that have shown successful single cell
encapsulation (at silica contents values of 2, 3, and 5 wt %) had
an average droplet diameter of 9.1 ± 6.8, 4.7 ± 1.7, and
2.7 ± 1.5 μm, respectively (Figure 2e), close in their values to the size of
the conidia cells, which are ∼4 μm in their length. These
results indicate that individual encapsulation can be achieved when
the sizes of the droplets and the cells are of the same order of magnitude.

The conidia cells assemble at the oil phase in the water/paraffin
biphasic system because of their hydrophobic surface.42,43 Nevertheless, the conidia cells have to overcome the barrier made
by the NPs that are located at the interface. The preparation of the
silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions is performed by an ultrasonic
probe. The exposure of a liquid sample to ultrasonic waves results
in vigorous agitation characterized with high shear forces that are
responsible for emulsification. However, ultrasonication cannot take
place in the presence of the conidia cells because it will lead to
cell lysis. Therefore, the conidia cells were incorporated only after
the emulsion formation, through gentle agitation by vortex, which
enables the penetration of the conidia cells into the paraffin droplets.

The ability of cells or particles to enter the droplets of Pickering
emulsions by introduction of shear forces to the system is explained
by the work of French et al.44,45 They have shown that
the particles in the o/w interface undergo transformations between
the droplets upon introducing shear forces, leaving temporary voids
at the interface. This phenomenon explains the successful encapsulation
of the conidia cells in the paraffin droplets through gentle agitation
that is apparently generating proper shear forces. Furthermore, the
implementation of NPs with a relatively low diameter (∼40 nm)
for the preparation of the Pickering emulsions might also decrease
their ability to form a barrier (at the interface) against the penetration
of the conidia cells that are 2 orders of magnitude larger (∼4
μm in length) than the NPs.

The obtained fluorescent signal
of the GFP conidia is a clear indication
of the viability of the cells when encapsulated in the oil phase of
the silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions. The conidia in the
emulsions remained viable for three weeks. The viability of the Metarhizium conidia cells while encapsulated in the
silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions was further characterized
by culturing the conidia on a Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) growth
medium (see Materials and Methods). The germination
percentages of the encapsulated conidia were 85 ± 8.3%, demonstrating
their viability and their ability to germinate. The control system
(without emulsion) had germination percentages of 95 ± 5%.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of the applied
emulsions (see Materials and Methods) revealed
a silica-based honeycomb structure with ordered hierarchical porosity
(Figure 3d,e). This
structure is formed during the drying process of the emulsion through
emulsion templating.46,47 It maintains the basic morphology
of the Pickering emulsion and preserves the single cell encapsulation,
as shown in Figure 3e. This finding is important as it demonstrates the individual arrangement
of the conidia on the leaves, which will lead to high efficiency of
the biopesticide activity against the target insect.

Application
of M. brunneum Conidia
on R. communis Leaves
To test
the functionality of the Pickering emulsions as a biopesticide formulation, M. brunneum conidia-GFP encapsulated in silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions were sprayed on R. communis leaves until full coverage (see Materials and Methods).

The distribution of the conidia cells on the leaves was
characterized by confocal microscopy. The Z projection (Figure 4a–c) and the three-dimensional
(3D) images (Figure 4e,f) are presented in Figure 4. The silica-NH2 Pickering emulsion (Figure 4a,d) exhibited a significantly
higher distribution of conidia cells on the leaves compared to the
controls (0.01% Triton X-100, Figure 4b,e; and water, Figure 4c,f). The higher cell distribution of the silica-NH2 Pickering emulsion is thus derived from the single cell encapsulation
in the emulsions. These findings were supported by SEM analysis showing
individual encapsulation of the conidia in the compartments of the
silica/paraffin honeycomb structure (Figure 3e). Single cell encapsulation is required
for efficient distribution of conidia cells on the leaf surface. The
conidia cells, which are hydrophobic, will localize in the oil phase.
Obtaining the suitable droplet size and composition has led to single
cell encapsulation. After the spray assay on the leaves with the Pickering
emulsion formulation, higher cell distribution was observed on the
leaf surface compared to water and Triton X-100 samples.

μm.

In order to quantify the number
of conidia cells on the leaves,
a Z series was taken and a Z projection was performed. The results
of the Z projection showed a higher count of conidia on the studied
system than the controls (Figure 4g, one-way ANOVA: F = 4.5042, df =
2, P = 0.0372). The single cell encapsulation in
the Pickering emulsions maintains the dispersibility of the cells
during the spray assay resulting in a higher number of conidia cells
on leaves. On the contrary, the lower amount of conidia cells in the
control samples resulted from cell agglomeration during the spraying
process because of poor dispersibility of the cells in the aqueous
medium. Triton X-100-based suspension was used as a standard in the
screening of entomopathogenic fungi in many studies.41,48,49 In addition, surfactants including
Triton X-100, are being extensively used in commercial formulations
of microbial control agents.50,51

Biological Functionality
of Conidia Incorporated in Silica-NH2 Pickering Emulsions
The S. littoralis larvae were indirectly
exposed to the conidia by inoculation of
the R. communis leaves with conidia
(see Materials and Methods and Table 2) incorporated in the silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions. The larvae were kept for seven days
and the mortality of the larvae was monitored at days 3, 4, and 7
(Figure 5a). Larvae
treated with conidia incorporated in the Pickering emulsion showed
75% mortality, whereas the formulation alone resulted in a mortality
of only 25%. Treatment with conidia in 0.01% Triton X-100 led to 40%
mortality. Corrected mortality and probability tests were performed
on the data. The analysis of corrected mortality is based on Abbott’s
formula52 and is the adjustment of insect
mortality rates used worldwide in insecticide trials. The results
are presented in Figure 5b and Table 3, respectively. Table 3 clearly shows the
higher pesticidal activity of conidia incorporated in the Pickering
emulsions compared to the controls. The sporulation processes started
seven days postinoculation. The dead larvae were kept separately under
moist conditions to promote sporulation and confirm mycosis. Cadavers
were monitored daily for sporulation. Of the 14 dead larvae, 13 were
mycosed. An example of a sporulated larva cadaver is presented in Figure 5c; nontreated larva
from the control group is shown in Figure 5d.

These results confirm the
successful bioassay of encapsulated M. brunneum conidia on S. littoralis third instar
larvae after spray application. The results also demonstrate
the low toxicity of the Pickering emulsions (without conidia) against
the larvae and leaves. The activity of the conidia was enhanced by
their incorporation in the o/w silica-NH2 Pickering emulsions.
The increased efficiency of the Pickering emulsion-based formulation
can thus be attributed to the successful single encapsulation of the
conidia cells, which resulted in a significantly higher cell distribution
on the leaves.

In addition, the silica-based honeycomb structure
should decrease
the exposure rate of the conidia to humidity, resulting in a controlled
germination rate that will ensure the higher effectivity of the conidia
against target insects, and prolonged field persistence.

Conclusions
In summary, we presented a new approach for single cell encapsulation
by eco-friendly o/w Pickering emulsions stabilized by amine-functionalized
silica NPs. The emulsions were stable for months. M.
brunneum conidia cells, a well-studied biopesticide,
were incorporated into the Pickering emulsions. Single cell encapsulation
of the conidia was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The M. brunneum is localized in the oil droplets due
to the hydrophobic nature of their outer layer. The high tunability
of the droplet size along with high colloidal stability of the emulsions
enabled single cell microencapsulation. The silica-NH2 Pickering
emulsions were implemented to develop formulations for biopesticides.
The conidia incorporated in the emulsions were applied on leaves via
the spraying process. The studied formulation resulted in a higher
cell distribution on the leaves, leading to a high mortality rate
of S. littoralis larvae. The silica-based
honeycomb-like structure resulting from emulsion drying preserves
the single cell encapsulation on the leaf surface. The formulation
exhibited significantly higher pest control activity in comparison
to the controls. This successful single cell encapsulation along with
its high biopesticide activity is thus a promising, cost-effective,
innovative approach for tackling the pest control challenge.

Materials
and Methods
Salinization of Silicon Dioxide Surfaces with APTES
Silica (1 g) (AEROSIL OX 50, with an estimated primary particle size
of 40 nm, obtained from Evonik, Germany) was added to 40 mL of methanol
and stirred for complete dispersion. Then, APTES (99% Sigma-Aldrich)
was added slowly to the solution for a final concentration of 0.5
M. The reaction was carried out at ambient temperature for 45 min.
After silanization, the particles were collected by centrifugation
(9000 rpm, 10 min) and rinsed four times with methanol. Afterward,
the silica-NH2 NPs were dried at 35 °C under vacuum
for ca. 3 h.

Silica-NH2 Pickering Emulsion
Preparation
Pickering emulsions were prepared from amine-functionalized
silica
in water and paraffin oil (Sigma-Aldrich, analytical grade). First,
silica-NH2 NPs were dispersed in distilled water by sonication
for 5 min (Sonics Vibra-Cell 750 W, 25% amplitude) with increasing
silica content: 0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt %. Then, paraffin oil was added
at the o/w ratios of 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, and 30:70 vol %,respectively.
The mixture was sonicated for 5 min for emulsification.

Fungal Strains
and Culture Conditions
M. brunneumMa7(53) and M. brunneumMa7-GFP mutant41 were cultured
on SDA (Difco, Becton–Dickinson, MD) for 2 weeks at 28 °C
until sporulation. Conidial suspensions were prepared by harvesting
conidia by scraping the fungal colony, suspending the collected material
in sterile distilled water containing 0.01% Triton X-100, followed
by vortexing. The suspension was filtered through three layers of
gauze, and conidial concentrations were determined using a hemocytometer.

Viability Assay
Conidia viability in different suspensions
was determined by germination assay. Aliquots of conidial suspension
were applied over SDA plates and incubated for 18 h at 28 °C.
Conidia viability in the emulsion was measured at different time points
using confocal microscopy. Conidial fluorescence was the indication
for viability as described previously.41 Viability was satisfactory if rates were above 95% for germination
and fluorescent conidia.

Conidia Encapsulation in Silica-NH2 Pickering Emulsion
For single cell encapsulation in the
Pickering emulsion, for each
of the silica-NH2 NPs content, two different ratios of
oil/water were chosen: 20:80 and 30:70. 10 mg of M.
brunneumMa7-GFP conidia were added
to 10 mL of emulsion. The mixture was vortexed at high speed in vortex
mixers for 5 min. Cell samples (10 μL) were placed onto a glass
slide and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Conidia Distribution on R. communis Leaves
For the leaf spray assays,
three conidia samples
of M. brunneumMa7-GFP were prepared: silica-NH2 Pickering emulsion, 0.01%
Triton X-100, and distilled water. Conidia (10 mg) were added to 10
mL
of each sample, mixed well, and then sprayed on R.
communis leaves using a 50 mL hand sprayer (∼100
μL liquid per spray) for full coverage. The plant tissues were
left to dry at room temperature. To characterize the distribution
of conidia on plant tissues, leaf discs from each treatment were analyzed
by confocal microscopy.

Biological Functionality of Microencapsulated
Conidia as a Biopesticide
Formulation
To test the functionality of the silica-NH2 Pickering emulsion as a biopesticide formulation, a bioassay
was conducted to assess the LT50 of the different samples. R. communis leaves were sprayed with Pickering emulsions
and controls with and without conidia (see Table 2). Both sides of the R. communis leaves were treated using a 50 mL hand sprayer (∼100 μL
liquid per spray). The suspension contained 10 mL of 108 conidia/mL. After spraying, the leaves were dried for 30 min in
the hood. The dried treated leaves were hand cut and inserted into
a 55 mm Petri dish lined with filter paper impregnated with 500 μL
distilled water to maintain high humidity and a single S. littoralis third-instar larva. For each sample,
20 larvae were used. The plates were sealed and incubated at 25 °C
under a 12:12 L/D photoperiod. The larvae were examined at days 3,
4, and 7 for mortality. Food was supplied during examination. Dead
larvae were removed from the Petri dishes and incubated in a moist
chamber until sporulation occurred. The experiment was repeated three
times.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Image Analysis
The samples were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus,
FluoView 500) using argon laser 488 nm excitation. Fluorescence emission
of GFP was recorded at 500–520 nm. For 3D images, acquisition
used a Leica SP8 laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)
equipped with a solid state laser with 488 nm light, HC PL APO CS
20×/0.75 objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and Leica Application
Suite X software (LAS X, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Imaging of the
GFP signal was done using the argon laser, and the emission was detected
in a range of 500–525 nm. Autofluorescence of the chloroplasts
was detected in a range of 650–700 nm. For Metarhizium conidia counting, image stacks were first projected using a Z projection
(as maximum intensity) to find all the fluorescent conidia, then counted
by a cell counter using Fiji software.54 The droplet average diameter was measured for every sample by the
particles analysis tool of Fiji software based on confocal microscopy
images. 12 droplets were sampled from each image and plotted as a
3D graph with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).

Scanning Electron
Microscopy
SEM measurements were
performed using a MIRA3 field-emission SEM microscope (TESCAN, Brno/Czech
Republic) with an acceleration voltage of 1.0 kV and a secondary electron
detector. Pickering emulsion samples were drop-cast on a conductive
double stick carbon tape and dried under ambient conditions. Prior
to imaging, a thin layer of carbon was evaporated onto them to render
them electrically conductive and to avoid surface charging by the
electron beam.

Statistical Analysis
The JMP package
(SAS Institute,
2002) was used for all statistical analyses. Mortality data were corrected
by Abbott’s formula.52 Differences
in the number of conidia on the leaves and larvae survival were analyzed
by a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey–Kramer honestly significant
difference (HSD) for comparisons for all pairs. Difference in the
number of attached
