The
relay (on–off) controller can stabilize wide ranges
of processes including open-loop stable, integrating, and unstable
processes, producing sustained oscillations. For improved proportional-integral-derivative
controller tunings, methods to find process models with mixed closed-loop
tests of relay feedback and proportional-derivative (PD) controllers
are proposed. For unknown processes with arbitrary initial states,
relay feedback tests are first applied and, after cyclic steady states
are obtained, PD controllers or other relay feedback tests with set
point changes are followed. This full closed-loop operation is desirable
for integrating and unstable processes and will be useful even for
stable processes when processes are far from their desirable operating
points. Refined methods to find exact frequency responses of processes
from initial and final cyclic steady states are derived. Whole relay
feedback responses need not be saved. Several integrals at the relay
switching times are used without iterative tests or computations.

Introduction
Åström and Hägglund1 have used the relay feedback system to find the
ultimate gain and
period of a process to tune proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
controllers. The method can remove cumbersome and time-consuming field
tests of proportional controllers to obtain the ultimate gain for
the Ziegler–Nichols tuning.2 Because
of its simplicity, relay feedback has gained popularity for tuning
PID controllers in the field.3−10 For improved tuning of PID controllers, parametric models such as
the first order plus time delay (FOPTD) model are often identified
with the additional process steady-state gain information in addition
to the ultimate data of the process.11−15 For the process steady-state gain, the relay feedback
test should often be performed from the initial steady-state condition.
For integrating and unstable processes, it will be hard to maintain
the steady state without closed-loop control. Some previous methods
assume that processes are initially at steady states. Otherwise, closed-loop
identifications are tried while assuming that stabilizing controllers
are available. When stabilizing controllers are not known in advance,
several trial tests to find them will be inevitable. Here, for the
purpose of stabilizing the process and maintaining initial test conditions,
the relay feedback system is used and methods to analyze tests from
initial cyclic steady states are proposed. Trial tests to find stabilizing
controllers can be skipped, resulting in reduced test times.

Relay controllers can stabilize a wide range of unstable processes
with time delays. Co16 investigated relay
stabilizations of unstable processes with time delays. Mehta17 studied methods to enlarge the range of unstable
processes by introducing a proportional-derivative (PD) controller
to the relay feedback system and proposed identification methods to
obtain parametric models. Methods to obtain parametric models for
unstable processes with time delays by analyzing the relay feedback
oscillations at the cyclic steady state have been proposed by several
researchers.18−20 These methods assume that a process is at a steady
state initially when the relay feedback starts. Marchetti et al.21 used two relay feedback tests with changing
time delay elements in the feedback loop to obtain low order plus
time delay models and design PID controllers.

The relay feedback
method can also be used to identify integrating
processes with time delays. First-order and second-order integrating
plus time delay models are identified from measurements of several
representative points in the relay feedback oscillations at the cyclic
steady state.10,22,23 For this, exact expressions of relay oscillations are used. Because
the equations are nonlinear for model parameters of the second-order
integrating processes with time delays, iterative computations are
often required.

Here, relay feedback is used to stabilize the
processes and to
maintain the operating points for identification. Identification tests
start from the cyclic steady states. To analyze responses that are
cyclic steady states initially, methods to find exact frequency responses24,25 are refined. By introducing additions and subtractions between shifted
responses, responses whose initial and final steady states are both
zero are obtained, so that integrations to compute process frequency
responses are possible. By applying Fourier transforms, exact frequency
responses and corresponding low order plus time delay models are obtained.
From initial relay feedback oscillations, useful process information
for the second closed-loop test is obtained. Hence, as for the conventional
relay feedback autotuning methods, the process information needed
a priori can be minimized regardless of the process type (stable,
integrating, or unstable). Simulation and experimental results are
given to illustrate performance of the proposed methods.

Process Activations
Several types of closed-loop tests as shown in Figure 1 are considered.

Figure 1 Three types
of closed-loop tests.

Activation Type I (Relay/PD
Control)
The first type
of closed-loop test (Figure 1(I)) is such that a relay feedback test is followed by a closed-loop
test with a PD controller. The relay feedback system will bring the
process close to a given operating point. When the relay oscillation
reaches the cyclic steady state, a PD controller is designed with
Ziegler–Nichols type tuning based on the ultimate data and
then the closed-loop test is implemented with this PD controller.

Activation Type II (Relay/Relay)
The second type of
closed-loop test (Figure 1(II)) has a relay feedback test followed by another relay
feedback test. For the second relay feedback test, the set-point change
should be applied to obtain the process steady-state gain accurately.

Activation Type III (Relay/Symmetric Relay)
In this
method, the second relay feedback responses are assumed to be symmetric
(Figure 1(III)). Relay
feedback methods that guarantee symmetric oscillations by removing
the static load disturbances26,27 can be used. For integrating
processes, the second symmetric relay oscillations can be realized
just by removing the steady-state values of inputs obtained from the
cyclic steady states of the first relay feedback. These symmetric
oscillations are not affected by set-point changes of the second relay
tests.

Frequency Response Estimations
Methods
to obtain process frequency responses are first derived.
Consider the linear time invariant process 1  where G(s) is the process transfer function, Y(s) and U(s) are
the Laplace transforms
of the process output y(t) and input u(t).

From the input and output responses
of Figure 1, frequency
responses will be obtained. For
this, we consider the shift transformations 2  where pa and pb are periods of the first and second parts
of responses at the cyclic steady states (Figure 1), respectively. The transformed responses
of eq 2 are shown in Figure 2 and their Laplace
transformations can exist. As the transfer function between each delayed
input and output is G(s), we have 3  

Figure 2 Transformed responses.

Hence, frequency responses of G(s) can be obtained by analyzing responses of u̅(t) and y̅(t), whose Laplace transforms are U̅(s) and Y̅(s), respectively.

Proposition 1 (Activation Type I–III)
Consider
responses of Figure 1. It is assumed that responses are periodic for t < 0 and t > tf,
whose periods are pa and pb, respectively. Then, 4  

Proof: Applying the Laplace
transformations to responses of eq 2, we have 5  

Putting eq 2 leads
to eq 4. Detailed calculations
are given in the Appendix.

Kim et al.25 proposed a similar equation
for process frequency responses. The first relay oscillations are
assumed to be continued for t > 0 and deviation
responses
from the extended responses of the first relay are analyzed. In eq 4, such imaginary responses
are not needed.

The term exp(−αt) in the above equations
can reduce magnitudes of responses of u(t) and y(t), making responses integrable
for the computations of frequency responses.9 However, there is a lower limit in the choice of α to guarantee
the desired decrement rate. In the proposed method, because the transformed
responses of eq 2 are
integrable without the term exp(−αt),
even α = 0 can be used. Here, the term exp(−αt) with a small α is used to reduce noise effects.

Corollary 1-1 (Activation Type I)
When the final states
are constant (the period pb is zero),
then 6  

Proof: Applying the L’Hospital
law 7  

Equation 6 can be
obtained.

Corollary 1-2 (Activation Type II–III)
The process
steady-state gain becomes 8  

Proof: Applying the L’Hospital
law 9  

Corollary 1-3 (Activation Type I)
When the final states
are constant, the process steady-state gain becomes 10  

Proof: Applying the L’Hospital
law to eq 8 for pb → 0, eq 10 can be obtained.

Consider responses of Figure 1(III) and the shift
transformations 11  

Here,
the second relay responses are symmetric. As in eq 3, it is easy to show that Ŷ(s) = G(s)Û(s) and frequency
responses of G(s) can be obtained
by analyzing responses of û(t) and ŷ(t) whose Laplace
transforms are Û(s) and Ŷ(s), respectively. Additions of
half period responses of eq 11 can be found in Hofreiter.28

Proposition 2 (Activation Type III)
It is assumed that
responses for t < 0 are periodic with a period
of pa, and responses for t > tf are periodic with a period pb and are symmetric. Without the loss of generality,
the average values of u(t) and y(t) at the final cyclic steady state are
assumed to be zero, that is, u(t + pb/2) = −u(t) and y(t + pb/2) = −y(t) for t > tf. Then, 12  

Proof: As in proposition
1, eq 12 can be obtained
by applying Laplace transforms to responses of eq 11. Detailed derivations are given in the Appendix.

Comparing eqs 4 and 12, the last integral
terms in the numerator and denominator
are different. Because eq 4 can be applied to the activation type III for eq 12, the last terms of eq 4 can become the last terms of eq 12, providing another proof for eq 12. Consider 13  Here, ybm is the average
value of y(t) for t > tf and hence, y(t + pb/2)
= −y(t) + 2ybm, t > tf. The same equation can be derived for the input u(t). As 1 – e–(α+jω)pb = (1 – e–(α+jω)pb/2)(1 + e–(α+jω)pb/2) and the average values of u(t) and y(t) are assumed to be zero, eq 12 can be obtained.

The assumption that the average values
of u(t) and y(t) are zero can
be removed by adding the average values to the last terms as 14  

Corollary 2-1 (Activation
Type III)
Under the assumptions
of proposition 2, the process steady-state gain becomes 15  

Proof: Multiply 1 –
e–(α+jω)pa to both sides of the fraction of eq 12 and take the limit, α + jω → 0.
Then eq 15 can be obtained.

Special Cases
When pa = pb, we can use the shift transformation as 16  

In this case, proposition 1 is still
effective for computing frequency responses.

When both relay
oscillations are symmetric with pa = pb, we can use the shift
transformation of 17  

In this case, the following changes are required in proposition
2 18  Here, yam and uam are the
average values of y(t) and u(t) for t < 0.

Identification
and Tuning Methods
On the basis of the above propositions, G(α)
and G(α + jω) are first obtained from
the relay feedback tests. Then, low order plus time delay models and
corresponding PID controller parameters are computed.

Stable Processes
For a stable process, the FOPTD model 19  is identified. For a given G(α) and G(α + jω), each parameter
becomes 20  

Equation 20 is
derived from 21  

To design PI
controllers, the SIMC tuning rule30,31 is used.

Integrating Processes
For an integrating process, the
second-order model 22  is identified. For a small α, G(α) will be large and its estimation can have large
errors. In particular, it is impossible for α = 0. To avoid
this, we consider 23  

If the input u(t) is replaced by its integral 24  its Laplace transform becomes U(s)/s and the above method to find
the FOPTD model can be applied for eq 23. Differently, from Ĝ(α)
and G(α + jω), model parameters of eq 22 can be obtained as 25  

When q2 < 0, τ2 can be complex. In this case, by discarding the pole dynamics, a
pure integral plus time delay model of G(s) = kp e–θs/s is identified.

This identification
method for an integrating process can be applied
to stable and unstable processes with a dominant time constant compared
to the time delay and other time constants 26  

To design PID controllers, the SIMC tuning rule30 is used.

Unstable Processes
For an unstable
process, the FOPTD
model 27  is identified. Each parameter becomes 28  

Equation 28 is derived from 29  

To design PI
controllers, an analytic tuning rule by Cho et al.29 30  is used here. It requires a set point filter
of FR(s) = (λs + 1)/(βs + 1) to reduce overshoot
for step set-point changes.29 The design
parameter, λ is set to 3θ.

Autotuning Procedures
Applying the relay feedback autotuning method, relay feedback oscillations
are obtained as shown in Figure 1. Here, instead of the oscillation period and amplitude
at the cyclic steady state, several integrals of relay feedback transients
are used to obtain the exact frequency responses.

Proposed Method II-1
The following procedure is for
the activation type II and proposition 1.

Step 1: To bring the process to a given operating point, apply a relay
feedback test. Start the integration 31  

Step
2: When approaching the cyclic steady state,
set α and ω as 32  

Obtain integrals for t between
−pa and 0 33  

Step 3: At the time t = 0, the
set-point
is changed. Start the integrations 34  

For the activation type II, integrals of eq 34 are saved at each relay switching time tk.

Step 4: When responses reach their cyclic steady states,
terminate the test and compute 35  

Step 5: Compute
model parameters from 36  and determine which models are adequate among
stable, integrating, and unstable process models. Then, design PID
controllers.

Proposed Method I-1
For the responses
of Figure 1(I) (activation
type I), design
the PD controller by the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule with ultimate
data obtained from the first relay feedback oscillations. In this
case, proposition 1 is used and eq 35 becomes 37  

Proposed Method III-2
When the second
relay oscillation
is symmetric (activation type III), proposition 2 of eq 12 can be used. In this case, eq 35 becomes 38  

Results and Discussion
Process 1 (Stable Processes)
The proposed methods are
based on the FOPTD model that fits G(0) and G(jωc/2), where ωc is
the critical frequency, and the SIMC tuning rule.30 For a given stable process transfer function, G(0) and G(jωc/2) and the corresponding
PI controller can be easily computed. Its tuning performances are
first investigated. Figure 3 shows closed-loop performances for the test batch processes
in Berner et al.10 It shows overshoots
for step set-point changes; peak amplitude ratios of the sensitivity
function ((1 + G(s)C(s))−1) and relative bandwidths are shown. They are compared with those
of the SIMC model reduction and tuning method.30,31 For all processes in the test batch, overshoots are below 20% and
peak amplitude ratios of the sensitivity function are below 1.8, showing
that the proposed method will be less aggressive. The bandwidth plot
shows that control actions of the proposed methods will be similar
or faster compared to the SIMC method.

Figure 3 Overshoots for step set-point
changes, peak amplitude ratios of
sensitivity functions (Ms) and normalized
bandwidths of PI control systems tuned by the method of G(0) + G(jωc/2) and SIMC for stable
processes (test processes in Berner et al.10).

To illustrate closed-loop performance,
one of the proposed methods
is applied to the process 39  

Figure 4 shows Nyquist
plots of the process of eq 39 and its FOPTD models. The FOPTD model of G(0) + G(jωc) is such that it fits G(0) and G(jωc), which
can be realized by conventional relay feedback methods. The FOPTD
model of SIMC is obtained by applying SIMC model reduction to the
process of eq 39. The
FOPTD model of G(0) + G(jωc/2) is such that it fits G(0) and G(jωc/2), which is realized by the proposed
methods. The model of the proposed method II-1 is the FOPTD model
obtained with the activation type II. Except for the FOPTD model of G(0) + G(jωc), computed
models have frequency responses close to each other, showing excellent
fitting results for a low frequency range. These models will be adequate
for conservative tuning of PI controllers. Figure 5 shows closed-loop responses of the above
four methods. As expected with the Nyquist plots of Figure 4, all three methods except
the G(0) + G(jωc) method show similar closed-loop responses, which are less aggressive.
On the other hand, the G(0) + G(jωc) method, which is the background one for conventional relay
feedback methods, shows somewhat oscillatory responses.

models.

Figure 5 Closed-loop responses for the processes of G(s) = 1/(s + 1)(0.3s +
1)2.

Liquid Level Experimental
System
To illustrate applicability
to real processes, the proposed method I-1 is tested with the liquid
level experimental system, where three tanks connected in series and
parallel realize third order dynamics, the level of the final tank
is measured with a pressure sensor and the influent flow rate is manipulated
with the pulse-width-modulated pinch valve.

Figure 6 shows test responses. From
the open-loop step test, the FOPTD model in Table 1 is obtained. From the relay feedback test,
process ultimate gain and period are obtained. With the process steady-state
gain information, the FOPTD model in Table 1 is obtained. With a successive P control
test as shown in Figure 6 (activation type I), the proposed method I-1 can be applied. The
FOPTD model obtained by the proposed method with activation type I
and proposition 1 is also given in Table 1. Comparing the models obtained, the FOPTD
model of the conventional relay feedback method shows that the time
constant is too large. Figure 7 shows closed-loop responses. The conventional relay feedback
method shows the fastest response, but it is somewhat oscillatory.
The open-loop step test method shows the slowest response. Response

relay feedback method and the open-loop step test method.

Process 2 (Integrating
Process)
Consider the process 40  

Integral and FOPTD (IFOPTD) models
are compared. When the exact transfer function is given, IFOPTD model
can be obtained by applying the SIMC model reduction method.30,31 Liu and Gao22 and Panda et al.23 have reported IFOPTD models from a relay feedback
test. Table 1 shows
IFOPTD model parameters. The proposed method II-1 (activation type
II and proposition 1) and III-2 (activation type III and proposition
2) provide very similar IFOPTD models, whose closed-loop responses
are not distinguishable. When noise is added, the time constant, τ2 can be complex sometimes. In this case, the time constant
is set to zero and the pure integral plus time delay model is identified.
Except the IFOPTD model of Panda et al.,23 frequency responses are all similar (Figure 8). The model of Panda et al.23 should be replaced by their integral model having a zero
term. Figure 9 shows
closed-loop responses. They are all excellent.

Consider
the process 41  

Unstable FOPTD models reported by Park
et al.,32 Majhi and Atherton,33 and Liu and Gao22 are compared. Table 1 shows the FOPTD model parameters. The proposed method II-1 (activation
type II and proposition 1) is applied to this unstable process. Figure 10 shows Nyquist
plots. Except the FOPTD model of Majhi and Atherton,33 frequency response fittings are all excellent. Figure 11 shows closed-loop
responses. All methods are acceptable. Figure 12 shows test responses of the proposed activation
type II under noisy environments. As given in Table 1, noise with small magnitude does not affect
the model parameter estimations much.

Conclusions
Relay
feedback autotuning methods for stable, integrating, and
unstable processes with time delays are proposed. For the relay feedback
tests, two successive tests of relay/PD control and relay/relay are
used. The first relay feedback test is to derive the process at a
given operating point and to maintain the cyclic steady states for
starting the identification test. Then, the second test with process
information obtained from the first relay feedback oscillation is
followed. Methods to obtain the exact frequency responses from the
relay feedback responses that are at cyclic steady state initially
are proposed. Low order plus time delay models are obtained from the
steady-state gain and frequency responses at half the critical frequencies.

For stable processes with time delays, the proposed method based
on the FOPTD model obtained from the steady-state gain and frequency
response at half the critical frequency is shown to be acceptable,
reducing the somewhat aggressive closed-loop performance of conventional
relay feedback methods. When the process is far from the desirable
operating condition, the first relay feedback test will be very useful
in obtaining the desirable steady state to start the identification
test. For integrating and unstable processes, closed-loop tests are
desirable and our relay feedback tests can be promising candidates.
Simulations and experiments illustrate the usefulness of the proposed
methods.
