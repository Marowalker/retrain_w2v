Rapid, large-scale,
and low-cost coating methods that enable precise
control of the crystal growth of organic semiconductors are essential
to deliver high-performance devices that are robust and reproducible.
In this work, a novel method is presented based on a gas blow coating
technique, enabling the deposition of thin films of organic semiconductors,
whose morphology can be optimized by adjusting the deposition parameters.
We demonstrate the deposition of aligned single crystals of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene
(TIPS-pentacene) and 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) by gas blow coating and their use as
active layers in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices. The
OFETs of TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT have charge mobilities of 0.15
and 1.4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively, with low threshold voltages and on/off ratios exceeding
105. This coating method can also be extended to polymeric
semiconductors: films based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)] are realized, establishing gas blow coating as a novel
and efficient technique for the deposition of thin films of organic
semiconductors.

1 Introduction
Organic
electronic devices, including organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs),1,2 organic solar cells,3 and organic light-emitting diodes,4 have
attracted tremendous attention over the last decades due to their
low-cost and fabrication flexibility, ensured by the use of solution
processing.5 The performance of all of
these devices is strongly dependent on the molecular arrangement within
the active layer, which strongly depends on the method used to deposit
the organic material on the substrate. Large variations in OFET performance
have been reported by using different deposition methods and the same
organic semiconductor.6Table S1 provides a short overview for OFETs fabricated using
6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) and 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT), which are highly crystalline
small molecule semiconductors, by a variety of techniques. It is well
known that deposition of aligned single crystals with the highest
order and purity leads to devices with the highest electrical performance.7−9 This alignment is achievable through control of the crystallization
by patterning the wettability of the surface.10,11 However, this method usually requires complex and time-consuming
patterning processes, hindering practical utility. A simpler approach
is based on direct control of the crystal growth using low-speed (<2
mm/s) meniscus-guided processes such as solution shearing,8,12 dip coating,13 and slot-die coating.14 Alternatively, small angle drop casting15,16 and droplet-pinned crystallization17 have
also been employed to deposit aligned single crystals by controlling
the self-organization process in a specific direction with the aid
of gravity or of a solid pinner. Use of antisolvents has also been
used to control crystallization, using double-shot inkjet printing,7,18 spray printing,19 and solution-epitaxy
growth.9 Thus, there is strong interest
in developing new coating methods for the deposition of films of well-aligned
organic single crystals.

In nature, the growth of ice crystals
is controlled by the air
flow in the atmosphere, producing beautiful snowflakes.20 To date only a few reports have discussed the
use of a similar method, based on gas flow, for the deposition of
thin films from solution.21−24 In particular, there is no systematic study on the
effect of the deposition parameters on the resulting film morphology.
Herein, we report a novel deposition method based on gas blowing,
using a gas knife to deposit films of organic semiconductors. Uniform
films of well-aligned single crystals of small molecules can be rapidly
deposited on a large scale by controlling the moving speed and gas
supply pressure of the gas knife. This method gives highly aligned
crystalline films of TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT, showing OFET charge
carrier mobilities of 0.15 and 1.4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. In addition, thin films of
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPTTT) with good uniformity have been prepared, demonstrating
the utility of this method for the deposition of small molecule, as
well as polymeric semiconductors.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Influence of the Gas Blow
Coating Deposition
Parameters on the Thin Film Morphology
The coating system
is based on a modified doctor blade coater, where a gas knife (from
EXAIR) supplies a uniform laminar gas-flow (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The process is conducted in ambient
atmosphere (20–27 °C and 10–30% relative humidity).
This deposition method is capable of preparing thin films on several
substrates at the same time, thus improving the batch-to-batch reproducibility.
Note that this deposition method is very different from the original
doctor blade coating, as the distance from the gas knife to the substrate
is more than 5 mm, in contrast to the doctor blade, where a low distance
(usually below 100 μm) is usually applied to contact and guide
the spreading of the solution.

There are two main deposition
parameters that can strongly affect the morphology of the thin films:
the speed of the knife and the gas supply pressure. The effect of
these parameters was investigated by using TIPS-pentacene (8 mg/mL
in o-xylene) as a reference material. When a relatively
low gas supply pressure (0.3 bar) and a high knife speed (3.5 cm/s)
are used, an elongated wet film is deposited uniformly on the substrate
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). During
deposition, it is observed that crystal growth starts from the two
edges of the elongated wet film, and the crystals grow rapidly to
the middle, in the direction perpendicular to the gas flow direction
(Supporting Information, Figures S2 and
S3). This fast crystal growth is favorable for the formation of aligned
single crystals as the nucleation events are suppressed. Figure 1 gives a simple schematic
of the growth mechanism, which seems similar to the droplet pinning
method, in which a solid pinner is applied to assist the alignment
of the crystals during the growth.25 In
our case, a steady contact line is formed at the edge, from which
the crystals start growing. Crystals grow from the two contact lines
and therefore meet together in the middle, stopping the growth process.
This growth mechanism means a disruption line appears in the middle
of the film (Supporting Information, Figure
S4). When the gas supply pressure is increased or the knife speed
is decreased, the thickness of the deposited wet layer decreases,
so that the solvent evaporates faster, and thus random nucleation
sites are observed, resulting in solid thin films consisting of disconnected
parts with small crystals (Supporting Information, Figures S2 and S3). By further increasing the gas supply pressure
and using relatively low speed, many nuclei appear on the whole film,
leading to a uniform thin film of small particles (Supporting Information, Figure S5).

Figure 1 Schematic of the gas
blow coating method for deposition of aligned
crystals.

Note that there are also other
parameters, such as the angle or
the distance between the gas knife and the substrate, that could affect
the crystal morphology. Our homemade setup did not allow changing
of these parameters. It is expected, however, that changes in the
angle or distance should have similar effects to that observed when
changing the pressure, as the actual pressure guiding the droplet
decreases with the increase of the distance from the exit of the air
knife to the substrate.

According to these results, it is of
fundamental importance to
optimize the gas pressure and the knife moving speed in order to deposit
a uniform wet film without any disruption. Our results also show that
another important parameter that determines the size and degree of
alignment of the crystals, is the nuclei density: a high nuclei density
is needed to achieve uniform and aligned crystals.25 Therefore, the effect of the solution concentration on
the film morphology was investigated by depositing TIPS-pentacene
with concentrations in the range of 2–8 mg/mL in o-xylene. When the concentration is higher than 6 mg/mL, good crystal
alignment is observed (Supporting Information, Figures S6 and S7). In particular, at concentrations of 8 mg/mL,
droplets were uniformly spread, resulting in stable wet films that
do not recede, allowing complete crystallization. Long, well-aligned
crystals over a length of 100 μm are observed (Supporting Information, Figures S4b and S7d). Contact profilometer
measurements showed that the thickness of the deposited crystals increased
linearly with the concentration (Supporting Information, Figure S8), as expected.

The results indicate that in the
case of TIPS-pentacene in o-xylene, the best crystal
morphology is obtained by using
a concentration of 8 mg/mL, a moving speed of 3.5 cm/s, and a gas
pressure of 0.3 bar. Figure 2a,b shows polarized optical microscopy (POM) images of the
crystals. This figure shows that the contrast of individual crystals
changes from light to dark as the polarizer was rotated from 0°
to 90°, suggesting that the single crystal domains are highly
oriented over several millimeters in length. Figure 2c shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM)
image of a crystal with well-defined crystal boundaries are visible.
The roughness (Ra) of the surface of the
crystal is ∼0.18 nm and the thickness is 130 nm. The highly
crystalline nature of the thin film was further confirmed by thin
film X-ray diffraction measurements (Figure 2d). Intense diffraction peaks corresponding
to the (00l) planes of crystalline TIPS-pentacene
are observed.26 The strong diffraction
peak at 5.4° is assigned to the identical d-spacing
of 16.8 Å of TIPS-pentacene.14,19 The formation
of these aligned single crystals by fast crystal growth revealed that
the gas blow coating technique is capable of processing molecular
semiconductor thin films with high crystallinity.

and gas pressure of 0.3 bar. (e) Typical transfer (VD = −40 V) and (f) output characteristics of an
OFET device made with the film of TIPS-pentacene (inset panel (e):
optical micrograph of the device).

To evaluate the charge transport properties of the above
aligned
single crystals, OFET devices with a bottom-gate top-contact configuration
were fabricated on a doped silicon substrate, with a 290 nm thermally
grown oxide layer as dielectric. Gold electrodes were deposited perpendicular
to the aligned crystals (inset Figure 2e). Typical transfer and output characteristics of
the devices are shown in Figure 2e,f, respectively: the devices show p-type field effect
behavior with a small hysteresis. Over 20 devices were fabricated
by deposition of TIPS-pentacene onto six substrates with different
channel lengths (20–100 μm). The devices with a channel
length of 60 μm show an average saturation mobility of 0.07
± 0.04 cm2 V–1 s–1, threshold voltage (Vth) of 5 ±
3 V, and on/off ratios >105 (VD = −20 V). The highest mobility calculated is 0.15
cm2 V–1 s–1 (Supporting Information, Table S2). It should
be noted that as most of the papers in Table S1 use the width of the electrodes to estimate the carrier mobilities
for a better comparison, we also use the width of the electrode as
channel width. In this way, the carrier mobility obtained is slightly
underestimated as the crystals do not fully cover the channels.12 It is noticed that the mobility value achieved
here is lower than that reported by solution shearing method, in which
a higher carrier mobility is obtained by increasing the electron orbital
overlap between the molecules through the application of strain.27 Our process is very different because the aligned
crystals are formed by the self-organization of TIPS-pentacene molecules,
and no lattice strain is applied.8,25 Indeed, the
values of mobility reported here are comparable to those reported
for self-organized crystals13,15,28 or single crystals of TIPS-pentacene deposited by double-shot inkjet
printing18 or spray-printing19 (Supporting Information, Table S1).

The utility of the gas blowing coating technique
was then tested
for deposition of C8-BTBT, which is a p-type semiconductor showing
excellent performance in OFET devices.9,29,30 In this case, o-xylene was used
as the solvent. The ideal deposition parameters found for this material
are: knife speed of 3.75 cm/s, gas pressure of 0.18 bar, and concentration
of 4 mg/mL (Supporting Information, Figure
S9). We note that these values are rather close to those used for
the deposition of TIPS-pentacene, probably because these are both
molecular semiconductors deposited from the same solvent.

POM images (Figure 3a) show that the absorption intensity of the film becomes
totally
dark after the polarizer changes from 0° (left) to 90° (right),
demonstrating essentially mm-size single crystals. AFM measurements
show that the C8-BTBT film has a thickness of ∼18 nm and is
characterized by terraced structures with a 2.6–2.8 nm molecular
step (Supporting Information, Figure S9d,e)
and faceted edges (Figure 3b), in agreement with previous results.7,9 Additionally,
some defects are observed on the individual layers, which mainly derive
from the fast growth of the crystals (Figure S9d).

AFM images of the C8-BTBT films deposited from 4 mg/mL solution of o-xylene on silicon wafer by gas blow coating with knife
speed of 3.75 cm/s and gas pressure of 0.18 bar. Typical (c) transfer
(VD = −40 V) and (d) output characteristics
of the OFET device.

OFETs fabricated from
these crystalline films show ideal transfer
characteristics with very little hysteresis (<0.1 V) and a subthreshold
slope of 1.7 V/decade (Figure 3c). The output characteristics (Figure 3d) show excellent linear source/drain current–voltage
dependence at low voltages, in contrast to previous reports,7 showing that there is almost no injection barrier
at the contacts.29,31 More than 25 devices with different
channel lengths were fabricated. An average mobility of 0.7 ±
0.31 cm2 V–1 s–1 was
extracted, with a threshold voltage of −4.6 ± 0.9 V for
a channel length of 100 μm. The on/off ratio is in the range
of 106–107. The highest mobility extracted
is 1.4 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Supporting Information, Table S3), which is higher
than that obtained with standard deposition methods, such as spin
coating or vacuum deposition. Higher mobilities have been reported,
but these have been obtained with either more complex or expensive
deposition methods or by using blends (Supporting Information, Table S1).

2.2 Deposition
of P3HT and DPPTTT Films
To further demonstrate the utility
of this novel coating technique,
we also performed the deposition of conjugated polymeric semiconductors,
such as P3HT32,33 and DPPTTT.34,35

P3HT thin films, with around 250 mm width and several centimeters
length, were deposited on glass or hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-treated
silicon wafers from o-xylene, with a knife speed
of 0.6 cm/s and a gas supply pressure of 1.8 bar (Supporting Information, Figures S10–S12). DPPTTT thin
films with a similar area were deposited from chlorobenzene on octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS)-treated silicon wafers by gas blow coating with a knife speed
of 0.6 cm/s and gas pressure of 1.6 bar (Supporting Information, Figures S13–S14). It can be noted that
the same solvent (o-xylene) has been used for deposition
of TIPS-pentacene, C8-BTBT, and P3HT, however, a higher pressure and
lower speed is required for P3HT in order to achieve a uniform thin
film. In the case of P3HT, the thin films are directly obtained when
the gas knife drags the droplet forward, that is the solvent evaporates
almost instantaneously, rather than leaving a uniform wet film for
aligned crystal to grow, as observed for TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT.
In the case of DPPTTT, chlorobenzene is used as solvent, but the deposition
parameters are close to those used for P3HT, possibly due to the similar
solution behavior of the polymers and the use of a hydrophobic treated
substrate.

AFM measurements (Figure 4a) show that the P3HT film has uniform morphology
with a thickness
of 12 ± 1 nm and an average surface roughness of 0.2 nm. OFET
devices fabricated using such P3HT films show mobility in the range
0.0007–0.02 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Supporting Information, Table S4), which
is comparable to that reported for devices prepared using spin- or
drop-coating processes.32,33

thin film deposited from 10 mg/mL solution
of o-xylene on HMDS-treated silicon wafer and (b)
DPPTTT thin films deposited from 7 mg/mL solution of chlorobenzene
on OTS-treated silicon wafer by gas blow coating. Typical (c) transfer
(VD = −60 V) and (d) output characteristics
of the FET device for DPPTTT thin films.

The DPPTTT thin film has a thickness of 26 ± 3 nm and
an average
surface roughness of 0.7 nm (Figure 4b). Figure 4c,d shows representative transfer and output characteristics
of OFETs fabricated using these films—minimal hysteresis is
observed and the subthreshold slope is steep (0.7 V/decade). Over
60 devices with different channel lengths were fabricated and in all
cases the mobility exceeded 0.3 cm2 V–1 S–1 (average mobility is 0.4 ± 0.26 cm2 V–1 s–1 for channel length
of 60 μm). The highest mobility calculated is 1.5 cm2 V–1 S–1 (Supporting Information, Table S5), which agrees with the reported
values (by the supplier) for DPPTTT.36

3 Conclusions
In summary, this work presents
a new method, based on a gas blow-assisted
technique, for the deposition of small molecule and polymeric organic
semiconductors on a wide range of substrates. Well-aligned single
crystals of molecular semiconductors and uniform continuous films
of polymeric semiconductors can be deposited by optimizing the deposition
parameters. OFETs based on TIPS-pentacene, C8-BTBT, P3HT, and DPPTTT
have been demonstrated, showing comparable performances to those fabricated
by traditional deposition techniques.

Gas blow coating is a
unique, noncontact coating method, suitable
for the deposition of thin films with different morphologies, showing
tremendous potential for the fabrication of thin films from organic
molecules in solution. As organic crystals are used in several fields
(pharmaceuticals, food industry, and so forth), this technique may
be useful to produce controlled films or crystals on a substrate without
using expensive equipment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All materials and solvents
were bought from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received if not otherwise
specified. TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT have been selected to investigate
deposition of small molecule thin films, and P3HT and DPPTTT with
molecular weight around 30 kDa (purchased from Ossila) have been selected
to investigate deposition of high-performance small conjugated polymers.
Aceton and isopropanol (IPA) were used to wash the substrates. Microscope
glass slides were purchased from Fisherbrand, and oxidized Si wafers
are bought from IDB Technologies Ltd.

4.2 Characterization
of the Gas Blow-Coated Thin
Films
A Nikon Eclipse LV100 microscope equipped with a polarizer
was used to take optical images. A Bruker Dektak XT stylus profilometer
was used to measure the film thickness. A Bruker MultiMode 8 AFM in
tapping mode was used to analyze the morphology of the films. X-ray
diffraction measurements were carried out with a PANalytical X’PERT
MRD system.

4.3 Device Fabrication and
Measurement
Bottom-gate, top-contact OFET configuration was
used for device fabrication.
Heavily doped n-type silicon substrate served as bottom gate, and
∼290 nm oxide with the capacitance (C) of
10 nF/cm2 was used as the dielectric layer. The silicon
substrates used for gas blow coating of TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT
solution were washed and sonicated using acetone and IPA and further
cleaned by argon plasma treatment. The silicon substrates used for
P3HT and DPPTTT were treated using HMDS and OTS, respectively. After
deposition, the samples were annealed to eliminate the residual solvents
under different conditions: TIPS-pentacene and C8-BTBT films are put
in vacuum at 50 °C overnight, whereas P3HT films were annealed
in vacuum at 70 °C overnight; finally, DPPTTT films are annealed
at 140 °C under N2 for 40 min. Then, 70 nm thickness
of Au was thermally deposited through a shadow mask with the channel
length (L) of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 μm and channel
width (W) of 1000 μm for TIPS-pentacene. In
the case of C8-BTBT, P3HT, and DPPTTT, 50 nm of Au was used. Electrical
measurements were obtained by using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor
parameter analyzer in conjunction with a probe station. All measurements
were carried out in the ambient environment at room temperature. A
straight line fit of (ID)1/2 versus (VG – Vth) was used to extract the field-effect mobility (μ)
at the saturation regime. The threshold voltage (Vth) was extracted from the intercept at zero current.
