Quantitation of surface roughness is difficult, if subtle, but
significant differences cause an uncommon variance. We used atomic
force microscopy to measure the surface roughness of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) fibers before and after a 30 s plasma treatment
of 300 W. Samples were measured multiple times at different locations,
in four scan sizes. The surface roughness was expressed in terms of
nine roughness parameters. Despite the large number of data, simple
statistics was not able to detect significant differences in roughness
before and after plasma treatment. A factorial analysis of variance
(ANOVA) of the normalized data and a sum of ranking differences analysis
using four types of data preprocessing and their factorial ANOVA confirmed
that (i) the plasma treatment had roughened the PET fiber surface;
(ii) the roughness increases with the scanned area in the measured
range; and (iii) what the best roughness parameters are in discriminating
between surfaces before and after treatment. Although the compared
roughness estimators were on different scales, a roughness estimation
of the nanoscale surfaces was feasible, where other methods fail.
The presented methodology can be applied widely and unambiguously
for highly different method comparison tasks.

1 Introduction
Plasma
treatments of textiles and fabrics have been extensively
studied in the last decade as the textile industry is continuously
trying to fulfill the increasing demand of society in terms of enhanced
hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties, better printability, intelligent
filtration properties, flame retardation, biocompatibility, self-cleaning
finishes, and so forth.1−3 For the preparation of textiles with functional coatings,
surface modification is the most obvious and suitable technique. Several
wet chemical methods are available to tailor surface properties but
most of them bear several disadvantages like large chemicals and energy
consumption, influence on the bulk properties of fibers, health and
environmental hazard, and high cost.4,5 Plasma technologies
offer a much greener possibility for surface modification as they
are dry technologies without cooling water utilization, need minimum
amount of chemicals, are energy efficient, and have no pollution effect.6−8 Furthermore, plasma treatments are restricted to the uppermost layer
(10–20 nm) of the material without affecting the bulk properties.9,10

Obviously, plasma treatment of surfaces is carried out in
nonthermal
or cold plasmas, where the thermodynamic equilibrium is not reached.11,12

When a material is subjected to plasma treatment, chemical
and
morphological changes occur on the surface.13−15 Activation
and cleaning are typical chemical processes during which the surface
energy increases and the contaminations disappear, respectively. A
typical morphological effect is etching, when the bulk material is
damaged and gas-state by-products, usually atoms or small molecules,
are eliminated from the surface, resulting in the change of the surface
roughness.16−18 Usually all these processes take place simultaneously.

In our work, we studied the morphological changes of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) fibers induced by a plasma treatment [diffuse
coplanar surface dielectric barrier discharge (DCSBD)]. The surface
topography of untreated and treated samples has been characterized
by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which can provide three-dimensional
information about the surface morphology. According to a literature
survey,19−23 the roughness of the surface significantly changes, usually increases,
during plasma treatment because of the etching effect of plasmas.
However, an already large initial roughness may even decrease after
plasma treatment as a result of erosion of the asperities.24

Our earlier investigations of cellulose
fibers by AFM25 showed that a 30 s long
plasma treatment caused
a slight, but detectable roughness increase. However, the statistical
significance could not be unequivocally ascertained. Interestingly,
the roughness seemed to increase also with increasing scanned area.
Therefore, in our current study we wanted to answer the following
questions:1. Is it possible to detect and quantify
slight roughness changes by AFM, taking into account the relatively
large variance of the measurement data?

2. What are the most relevant roughness
parameters that can differentiate the two sets (treated and untreated)
of samples?

3. Does the
detection of roughness change
become easier with increasing observation area (scan size)?



2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy and AFM
Plenty of examples
can be found in the literature about the roughening
effect of different plasmas on PET and other fibers.26−31 In this work, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection found
nanoscale damage of the PET fibers after being treated for 30 s in
plasma (Figure 1).
In particular, pits with elliptical openings, usually aligned to the
fiber axis, and exfoliations were identified. However, this effect
of the plasma treatment is hardly visible; therefore, the evaluation
could be subjective and converting surface morphology changes into
numbers is not easy.

Figure 1 SEM micrographs of untreated (A) and plasma-treated (B)
PET fabrics,
3000× magnification. Apart from some particulate, debris-like
contamination, smaller and larger holes (ellipses) and exfoliations
(arrows) are visible on the plasma-treated samples.

In order to quantify the observed deteriorations, individual
fibers
were pulled out from samples of untreated and treated PET fabrics
and scanned by AFM. The tip of the AFM cantilever is raster scanning
downwards across the surface of the fiber from left to right. When
the scanning parameters are set so that the feedback loop reacts quickly
to the detected surface features, the deflection of the cantilever
is minimal and the corresponding deflection image is poor in contrast,
whereas the contrast of the height image is the best. On the contrary,
when the scanning parameters are set to a slower feedback loop reaction,
height image is poorer in contrast (as the tip is not closely tracking
the surface), whereas the deflection image is sharper (as the cantilever
is forced to deflect by the encountered surface irregularities). Both
height and deflection images are recorded, but only height images
are used in the analysis of the roughness data, as only these ones
contain the needed point-by-point height information of the topography.

For illustration, typical height images are shown for both untreated
and treated samples, in all four different scanning sizes, in the
3D color-coded, oblique view (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Representative 3D color-coded height maps of untreated,
respectively,
plasma-treated samples scanned at increasingly larger areas. Note
that the height scale range is 160 nm for all images except for the
two 4 μm2 scans, where it is 80 nm.

By a simple visual inspection of these images, obvious differences
in the roughness of the untreated and treated samples can be unequivocally
stated only in the case of the smallest, 4 μm2 scan
areas. Figure 3 summarizes
the results of roughness measurements before and after the plasma
treatment by presenting boxplot charts of nine roughness parameters
as a function of the scanned area. Two general trends can be observed:
(1) the mean of the individual roughness parameters is generally increasing
with increasing scan area, apparently tending to, but at the scan
areas of the experiments, not reaching, a plateau level (cf. ref (32)); (2) the means after
plasma treatment are generally higher in absolute value than the ones
before the treatment. However, a conclusion about the roughening effect
of the 30 s plasma treatment can be drawn only if the whole set of
corresponding data is compared. The outcome of univariate Mann–Whitney
tests is that the roughness parameters are significantly different
at the 0.05 error level at the lowest scan size (4 μm2) only. At larger scan sizes, the roughening effect of the plasma
treatment thus cannot be ascertained. However, the power of multivariate
statistical analysis is evidenced in the following.

of various roughness parameters of the PET
fibers before (black) and after (red) plasma treatment, as a function
of scanned area.

2.2 Effect
of Roughness Parameters (Analysis of
Variance of Normalized Raw Roughness Data, Table S1)
Normalization (NOR) was unavoidable as all roughness
parameters were on different scales. Figure 4 shows that a classical box and whisker plot
cannot discriminate between the roughness parameters.

Figure 4 Box and whisker plot
of various normalized raw roughness parameters
(overall).

Therefore, we had to decompose
the effect of factors by variance
analysis. Table 1 summarizes
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results.

The plasma
treatment (F1) is highly
significant: the roughness is considerably lower before treatment,
irrespective of the chosen roughness parameter (Figure S1). Almost all roughness parameters are equivalent,
except for the peak count (Figure S2).
A post hoc least significant difference test differentiates peak count,
but other post hoc tests (Bonferroni, Scheffé, etc.) do not.
Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances is not significant,
showing that all roughness parameters originate from the same distribution.
Vertical bars denote 0.95 confidence intervals.

The coupling
of the first two factors (plasma treatment and scan
area) can be seen in Figure 5.

Figure 5 ANOVA decomposition of two factors: plasma treatment, two levels,
b = before, a = after, and scan area, four levels, 4, 25, 45, and
64 μm2.

The line plot reveals
smaller roughness for untreated samples:
the red dotted line runs always above the blue solid line.

The
tendency is clear: as the scan area increases, the roughness
also increases.

At F2 = 25 μm2, the
difference is not significant in F1, but
the mean before treatment (b, blue full circle) is lower than after
treatment (a, red empty box), even in this case.

The conclusions
are obvious: plasma treatment causes coarsening
of the surface, and it is worth to consider a larger scan size for
better differentiation between samples before and after treatment
at least in this measurement scale.

The rudeness of the modeling
is revealed in the normal probability
plot of residuals, eq 6 (Figure S3).

2.3 Sum of
Ranking Differences Calculations
Sum of ranking differences
(SRD) is able to compare and group the
differently defined roughness parameters. The row average was selected
as the benchmark. The scaling problem persists; hence, four types
of data preprocessing has been carried out: NOR, rank transformation
(RNK), range scaling (SCL), and standardization (STD).

As an
example, the results for normalized SRD calculations can be seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6 SRD (values, scaled between
0 and 100) for normalized roughness
data. SRD [%] values are plotted on the x axis and
left y axis; the right y axis shows
the cumulative relative frequencies of the random ranking distribution
function (black curve). The 5% probability ranges (XX1), median (Med),
and 95% (XX19) are also given.

Peak count is indistinguishable from random ranking. Therefore,
it was eliminated from further analysis. Other roughness parameters
group together, Rz and Rmax being located closest to the reference.

Similar
SRD calculations have been completed for the other preprocessing
methods (RNK, SCL, and STD; data not shown).

2.4 ANOVA of SRD Scores
Roughness parameters,
except the peak count, were considered as factor 3, and four data
preprocessing options as factor 4 with four levels: NOR, RNK, SCL,
and STD (Table 2),
see part 4.4. Sevenfold cross-validation assigned
uncertainty values to SRD values in a repeated random manner. In this
way, 9 (roughness parameters) × 4 (preprocessing methods) ×
14 (repetitions) = 448 SRD values were calculated and the effects
of factors and their interactions were decomposed.

After decomposition
of the role of various ways to determine roughness by AFM, and the
preprocessing methods, the effect of the latter is only significant
at the 1% level, that is, it is reassuring that we have not incorporated
artificial information by using data preprocessing.

The various
ways to determine roughness (F3) and its
interaction with preprocessing (F3 × F4) are highly significant,
which can be seen in the next figure (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Weighted means for roughness measures (F3), effective hypothesis decomposition. An arbitrary
dotted line separates
the recommended roughness measures from the worse ones.

Based on the model, the following roughness parameters are
recommended:
(i) the vertical distance of the highest point from the lowest point
(maximal height, Rmax); (ii) the mean
vertical distance of the five highest points and five lowest points
from the mean plane (10 points mean, Rz); and (iii) the mean vertical distance of the five highest points
from the mean plane (average max. height, Rpm).

The worst parameter for expressing roughness is the vertical
distance
of the highest point from the mean plane, that is, the Rp.

It seems that the highest and deepest points
are not symmetric;
not the same roughness values are produced in case of positive and
negative deviations from the mean plane.

The zigzag pattern
in Figure 7 is arbitrary
as it depends on the enumeration (ordering)
of the roughness parameters. However, the significant differences
in the means are real and the grouping is quite straightforward. A
conservative Scheffé test amalgamates the three best roughness
parameters into one group, the other parameters being significantly
different from these three and from each other.

The residuals
of model (6) follow a normal
distribution in a much better way than the (normalized) raw data do
(Figure S4).

As for the future studies,
we plan to include other roughness parameters
in the comparison.

3 Conclusions
The
plasma treatment causes a significant increase of the surface
roughness, irrespective of the different ways of expressing the measured
roughness. Plasma treatment caused an increase (ca. 20%) in the normalized
roughness (independently of the way it was given).

The detection
and quantification of slight roughness changes can
be accomplished by AFM even if a relatively large variance is present
in the measured data.

The most relevant and recommended roughness
parameters are the
vertical distance of the highest point from the lowest point (maximal
height, Rmax); the mean vertical distance
of the five highest points and five lowest points from the mean plane
(10 points mean, Rz); and the mean vertical
distance of the five highest points from the mean plane (average max.
height, Rpm).

An increase in the
observing areas will enhance the detection of
small roughness differences in the studied scale.

The sum of
(absolute) ranking differences method is able to find
subtle differences and hence it can group the relevant parameters
even when the classical statistical tools fail. The best and worst
parameters can also be determined.

Although the compared roughness
estimators were on different scales,
a roughness estimation of the nanoscale surfaces was feasible, where
other methods fail. The presented SRD coupled with ANOVA can be applied
widely and unambiguously also for highly different method comparison
tasks.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 PET Fabric
and Plasma System
A DCSBD
plasma system was used for surface treatment of the PET fabric, (ROPLASS
s.r.o., Brno, Czech Republic) in ambient air. The nonthermal plasma
panel consisted of two systems of parallel strip-like electrodes embedded
in alumina matrix. The plasma was ignited with sinusoidal high frequency,
10–20 kHz, high voltage with peak-to-peak values of up to 20
kV. To keep the system at low temperature, cold oil was circulated
over the electrodes. The discharge was operated in air at 300 W, which
provided a quasihomogeneous diffuse plasma surface. Both sides of
the fabric samples were treated for 0.5 min. The treatments were performed
on a commercial PET fabric (55 g/m2). During the
treatment, both sides of the samples
were placed in the plasma. Before the treatment, the samples were
thoroughly cleaned to remove any sizing agent.

4.2 Morphological
Studies
Untreated and
treated PET fabric samples were investigated by an EVO 40 scanning
electron microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) at 20 kV
acceleration voltage. To avoid any electrostatic charging, the samples
were coated with a 10 nm thin gold layer.

4.3 Surface
Roughness Measurements
The
surface roughness of individual PET fibers, which were removed from
the untreated and treated fabric, was measured by a Dimension 3100
atomic force microscope equipped with a Nanoscope IIIa controller
(Digital Instruments/Veeco, Santa Barbara, California, USA) on 4,
25, 45, and 64 μm2 areas using silicon cantilevers
in contact mode with a 512 × 512 pixel resolution. The main parts
and the function of the AFM33 are illustrated
in Figure 8. The number
of measurements for the above four scan sizes was 16, 11, 7, and 13
in the case of samples before plasma treatment, and 13, 15, 12, and
9 in the case of samples after plasma treatment. Known weaknesses
and systematic errors of AFM scanning, such as tip convolution problems
determined by tip radius and cone angle, no tracking of deep trenches
and steep slopes, and so forth, were not taken into account in the
data treatment.

Figure 8 Working principle and key components of an AFM apparatus.

Raw measurement files were processed using the
Nanoscope software
by first applying a third-order flattening. Nine widely used roughness
parameters, see for example, ref (34), were determined, such as the1. root mean square
roughness (also Rq) 1  where zi represents the distance of the ith point
from the mean plane;

2. mean roughness, Ra 2  

3. max.
height, Rmax, the vertical distance of
the highest point from the lowest
point;

4. 10 points mean, Rz, the mean vertical distance of the five highest
points and
five lowest points from the mean plane;

5. peak count, the number of peaks higher
than the threshold value (here: 0.1 Rq);

6. max. peak height
(Rp), the vertical distance of the highest
point from the
mean plane;

7. average
max. height (Rpm), the mean vertical distance
of the five highest points
from the mean plane;

8. max. depth (Rv), the vertical distance
of the lowest valley from the mean
plane;

9. average max.
depth (Rvm), the mean vertical distance
of the five lowest points
from the mean plane.



For the multivariate
statistical analysis, the last two parameters
(max. depth and average max. depth), being negative numbers, had to
be reversed, their opposite values being denoted as Rv_ and Rvm_. Several other
roughness parameters derived from the AFM measurement data (see, e.g.,
ref (35)) have not
been included in the analysis. One of the excluded parameters was
the (dimensionless) roughness factor (fr or r), defined as the ratio of the real (or rather,
measured) surface area to the projected surface area. The roughness
factor is relevant only in fields and applications where the real
surface area is known, but this is rarely the case: for example, in
electrochemistry and contact angle and wetting disciplines.36 In our case, however, roughness parameters used
in the field of tribology, more relevant for the application of such
fibers, have been considered.

4.4 Data
Preprocessing
The samples were
arranged in the rows, whereas the roughness parameters were arranged
in the columns of a table (called input matrix in the fields of chemometrics).
Data reduction has not been carried out, as no constant or highly
correlated variables were present. On the other hand, the above roughness
parameters spanned over considerably different scales; therefore,
proper scaling was unavoidable, using the most prevalent scaling options:
NOR, RNK, SCL, and STD.

The NOR, often confused with STD, scales
each variable to unit length, that is, it divides each matrix element
by the column Euclidian norm (L2-norm) 3  where i = 1, 2, ..., n is the number of rows
(samples) in the input matrix.

RNK substitutes the numerical
values with rank numbers (also column
wise), the smallest number receives rank number one, the second smallest
two, and so on.

SCL: all variables can be transformed to the
[0, 1] interval easily
using the equation below 4  where j = 1, 2, ..., m is the number
of columns (roughness parameters) in the
input matrix.

All values are forced within the range between
zero [for minimum(s)]
and unity [for maximum(s)].

STD is carried out in two steps:
(i) centering (column mean is
subtracted from each matrix element) and (ii) each centered matrix
element is divided by the standard deviation of the respective column.
It is denoted by STD.

4.5 Sum of Ranking Differences
This technique
was recently developed for fair method comparison and readily received
general usage from chromatographic column comparison37 to multicriteria decision making.38 It can easily be perceived that an actual method that is “closer”
to a gold standard (reference) is better than any other alternative.
Here, the nine roughness parameters defined in part 2.3 have been compared by SRD. It is interesting to know, which
one is the best among them, which ones are equivalent, and whether
there are any significant differences among them. The SRD technique
coupled with ANOVA can answer these questions easily.

Row-averages
were used as the gold standard (benchmark) as the biases of different
measurement techniques also follow normal distribution, which is a
widely and unambiguously accepted empirical finding in analytical
chemistry (e.g., laboratories are compared using z-scores39 with the assumption of normality
in proficiency testing). After this data fusion operation, a column
by column evaluation follows: the calculation of (absolute) differences
between the standard and the individual vector rank-coordinates, and
summation of the absolute differences for each sample. These values
are the sum of the absolute ranking differences and are abbreviated
as SRD. SRD values rank and group the individual roughness parameters.

The basic idea of SRD calculations is presented in ref (40) The SRD values are, in
fact, Hamming or city block distances 5  where ri is the rank number of object i for the actual
roughness parameter and qi is the rank number of object i for the gold standard,
here the row-average.

Generally, only the normalized SRD values
(scaled between 0 and
100) are plotted on the x and y axes,
that is, not the line lengths carry information, but line grouping
and closeness of lines to zero [i.e., a “good” roughness
parameter is closer to the gold standard (reference) than a “worse”
one], and their overlapping with the distribution of SRD values for
randomized rank numbers. The latter is also plotted to the right y axis; overlapping means that the respective roughness
parameter(s) is (are) indistinguishable from random ranking. This
randomization test is called comparison of ranks with random numbers
and denoted as CRRN.41

Identical
numbers in the input matrix may distort the ranking procedure;
however, ranking with ties is also possible, using partial ranking:40 our visual basic application program for MS
Excel is downloadable from: http://aki.ttk.mta.hu/srd.

All details, SRD distributions,
and theoretical background are
given in our earlier works.40−42

The only limitation for
SRD procedure is the too small number of
rows: though the algorithm starts at the row number of three, the
probability of accidental decision is heightened, then. Empirical
evidences suggest that above the row number of six, the random ranking
is negligible.

The entire SRD procedure contains not only the
calculation of Hamming,
or city block distances, but involves two validation steps: (i) a
randomization test as shown above and (ii) n-fold
cross-validation. The computer code allows calculating 5- to 10-fold
cross-validation in a stratified and in a random manner (repeated
resampling). In this work, we used sevenfold cross-validation in a
repeated random manner [also called Monte Carlo (re)sampling].

4.6 Analysis of Variance
Two types of
ANOVA have been carried out:(i) A factorial ANOVA was completed on
the normalized raw (roughness) data with three factors (i) plasma
treatment (F1) with two levels [before
(b) and after (a) treatment]; (ii) scan area (F2) with four levels (4, 25, 45, and 65, all in μm2); (iii) roughness parameters (F3) with nine levels, see part 2.3. The number
of repetitions were different, but on average 12. Hence, the model
was 6  where b0, b1, b2, ..., b12, and so forth, are constants. Altogether
885 roughness values were evaluated: 2 (treatment options) ×
4 (scan areas) × 9 (roughness measures) × ∼12 (repetitions).



The raw data can be found in Table S1.(ii) A factorial ANOVA on SRD values:
rescaling of the roughness parameters and ordering by SRD allows revealing
more effects by factorial ANOVA.43 The
first ANOVA coupling with SRD has already been published in 2014.44 Uncertainty values were assigned to SRD values
by use of a sevenfold cross-validation as follows. Approximately 1/7th
of the samples were removed with repetitions many times. SRD ranking
of roughness parameters was completed on the remaining (approximately
6/7th) of the samples, that is, on the training sets, and the left-out
part was simply ignored. As the number of samples during cross-validation
is smaller, the variance is slightly overestimated (a conservative
estimation). Roughness parameters were considered as factor 3 also
here (F3), except for the peak count that
was excluded from further analysis. Four data preprocessing options
were considered in SRD calculations (F4): NOR, RNK, SCL, and STD, see part 2.4. Sevenfold
cross-validation multiplied by the SRD values many (14) times: in
such a way 9 (roughness parameters) × 4 (preprocessing methods)
× 14 (repetitions) = 448 SRD values were calculated and the effects
of factors and their interactions were decomposed. The following model
was considered 7
