Ln3+-ion-doped nanomaterials
possess excellent properties
because of their high color purity, longer excited state lifetime,
narrow emission, and large Stokes shifts. In this work, we studied
the correlation between the luminescence properties of La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ pyrochlore nanoparticles
(NPs) synthesized by a molten salt synthesis (MSS) method at a relatively
low temperature and several MSS processing durations (from 1 to 12
h). We synthesized these NPs with different sizes just by changing
the MSS processing time without subjecting to high temperature. Raman
spectroscopy confirmed the stabilization of the ideal pyrochlore structure
of the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs
at various MSS processing durations. The synthesized NPs exhibited
bright red emission under UV, visible, and X-ray excitations, highlighting
their potential applications as a red phosphor and scintillator. As
the MSS processing time was increased from 1 to 12 h, a spectral change
in the position of the charge transfer state in the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs was observed. The
sample processed by the MSS with a duration of 3 h exhibited the highest
luminescence intensity, which was attributed to its optimum crystals
with least surface defects and less agglomeration. The obtained results
strongly and unambiguously indicate the brighter side of this new
type of pyrochlore-based NPs in the fast growing field of solid-state
lighting and scintillator materials.

1 Introduction
Materials
with A2B2O7-type composition
fall into a special class of structure called pyrochlore, in which
A represents a trivalent rare-earth (RE) ion and B represents a tetravalent
transition metal ion such as Sn4+, Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+. Recently, they have gained a significant
interest as ceramics because of their unique properties such as high
radiation stability, ability to accommodate actinides and lanthanides
at both AIII and BIV sites,1 and ability to dissipate excess radiation energy by forming
antisite defects. For the same reason, they have been used for immobilization
of high-level nuclear waste.2 Other than
nuclear energy applications, these materials have also been found
to be an excellent host for lanthanide-doped phosphor materials because
of their other favorable properties, such as suitable refractive index
value, high chemical and thermal stability, wide band gap, etc.3−5 In addition, because of their high chemical stability, high catalytic
activity, high melting point, and excellent oxide ion conductivity,6 they have innumerable applications in many other
scientific and technologic areas, such as magnetic materials,7 gas sensors,8 catalysts,9 solid oxide fuel cells,10 lithium ion batteries,11 structural materials
in fusion reactors,12 etc. Moreover, A2B2O7 pyrochlore nanocrystals possess
excellent luminescent properties, including intense photoluminescence
(PL) in the infrared region, efficient pump-power dependence of light
emission,
and excellent cathodoluminescence.13

Structurally, A2B2O7-type compounds
belong to the fluorite–pyrochlore phase family.14 Preference for either phase is contingent on
the ionic radius of the RE3+ ion in the A-site and the
B4+ ion in the B-site. The fluorite structure is favorable
if the ionic radii of A3+ and B4+ ions are similar
(rA/rB <
1.46). The oxygen vacancies are randomly distributed on the anion
sites. The similar ionic radii of the A3+ and B4+ cations give them the capability to swapping sites in the lattice,
which leads to antisite defects.14 On the
other hand, the pyrochlore structure has D3d symmetry and differs from the fluorite in that it
has a more ordered structure, which causes the cations to prefer the
site most suitable for their size. The A3+ ions have an
eightfold coordination with oxygen, and the B4+ ions have
a sixfold coordination with oxygen. The anion Wyckoff sites (8b and
48f) are entirely occupied.

Among pyrochlores, La2Hf2O7 stands
out with unique properties such as high density, high refractive index,
wide band gap, and high thermal/chemical stability, which are very
important from a technical perspective. It has been envisaged to be
a very good dielectric material because of its rather low defect densities
and less Fermi-level pinning than those of HfO2.15 Also, because of its high stopping power for
X- and γ-rays with ZHf = 72 and
its high density of 7.9 g/cm3, it was found to be very
attractive for novel high-energy radiation detectors.16 La2Hf2O7 is also known
to exhibit defect-induced luminescence on irradiation with ultraviolet
photons, and the oxygen vacancies were found to be the most probable
reason for the recombination centers in their photoluminescence process.17

Doped RE2Hf2O7 nanoceramics with
metal ions have proven to be very successful in tailoring their
electrical,18 optical,19,20 nuclear,21 and order–disorder
phenomena;22 scintillation;23 etc. Our group recently has done some work on
photo- and radioluminescence (RL) of the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ nanoparticles (NPs).4,16

There are various ways to induce changes in the particle size of
nanophasic materials, such as changing the pH value of the precursor
solution, varying the annealing temperature, altering the synthesis
duration, differing the reaction kinetics, and modifying the thermodynamics
of reactions. The changes of synthesis duration and temperature may
indirectly affect the obtained particle size, crystallinity, coordination
number, and geometry around dopant ions in an inorganic phosphor.
This also leads to change in the type, size, and density of defects.
It was reported that the synthesis temperature and duration have profound
effects on the size, morphology, defect density, and surface energy
of obtained products,24−26 which ultimately alter the optical properties of
nanomaterials. Melato and his group investigated the effect of annealing
time on the structure, morphology, and photoluminescent properties
of MgAl2O4:In3+ nanophosphor.27 On the other hand, Motloung et al. investigated
the effects of the annealing time on the optical properties of ZnAl2O4.28 There are a few
more reports on the effect of annealing time on optical properties
of YAG:Ce3+ and ZnAl2O4:Cr3+, etc.29−31 Not many studies in this direction have been carried
out to explore the effect of synthesis processing time on the optical
properties of nanophosphors, not to mention those during the molten
salt synthesis (MSS) process, until the current study.

Exploitation
of a luminescence probe that is sensitive to the local
structure is expected to give useful information on its local site,
site symmetry, and distribution ratio at the A3+ and B4+ sites in A2B2O7-type compounds,
which are very important for designing efficient optoelectronic devices.
A 4f electron exhibits special photophysical characteristics compared
with 3d and 5f electrons and therefore exploring nanomaterials doped
with luminescent lanthanide ions has been found to be an indispensable
approach for designing high-quality nanophosphors for future applications.
Once doped with the Ln3+ ion, NPs exhibit photophysical
properties that are different from those of their bulk counterparts
because of their small grains. Meltzer et al. reported increased photoluminescence
efficiency of nanophasic materials compared to that of their bulk
counterparts.32

It is well documented
that Eu3+ ions form an ideal spectroscopic
probe for lanthanide sites due to their distinct spectroscopic signature,
integer J-numbers, and the ease of assessing their
site symmetry. Their ground-state 7F0 and the
most informative excited state 5D0 are nondegenerate.
Therefore, they are not split by crystal-field effects.33,34 Eu3+ ions with the characteristic orange red emission
at 592 and 614 nm are highly sensitive to the local surroundings.35 The Eu3+ photoluminescence and spectral
data can give highly reliable information on whether the dopant ions
are localized on the surface of A2B2O7 NPs or they have percolated either interstitially or substitutionally
inside the A2B2O7 lattice. Although
closeness in size and charge guarantees most of the Eu3+ ions to occupy the A3+ site, there may be lattice strain
to mismatch in
ionic radii between eight-coordinated Eu3+ and RE3+ ions, which may affect the optical properties of Eu3+ ions.

Despite the wide array of applications, investigations
on RE2Hf2O7-type compositions are
limited.
To the best of our knowledge, among the available literature, only
Papan and his group have carried out luminescence spectroscopy and
Judd–Ofelt (JO) analyses on their combustion-synthesized europium-doped
Y2Hf2O7, Gd2Hf2O7, and Lu2Hf2O7.20 In this study, we have correlated the changes
in optical properties of europium-doped lanthanum hafnate La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs synthesized by an
environmentally friendly MSS method as a function of processing duration
with the Judd–Ofelt parameter and other related photophysical
parameters.36 Judd–Ofelt analysis
was carried out to decipher various photophysical information, such
as radiative and nonradiative transition rates, quantum efficiency,
Judd–Ofelt parameters, branching ratio, etc. In addition, systematic
studies were carried out to explore the potential applicability of
these La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs
as phosphor materials. The focus was to synthesize highly efficient
red phosphors for multifunctional applications that have the ability
to get excited by UV light (mid and near UV), blue light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), green LEDs, and X-ray. We have also explored the effect
of the MSS processing duration of these NPs on their X-ray-excited
optical luminescence for the first time.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
is one of the most sensitive techniques to probe metal–oxygen
(M–O) vibrational modes, so it is one of the most sought-out
techniques to differentiate between ordered pyrochlore and disordered
fluorite phases (DFP), which is very difficult to achieve by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) most of the time. The disordered fluorite phase
(DFP) exists in the Fm3̅m space
group wherein all of the cationic ions (A3+ and B4+) are randomly distributed. On the other hand, the ordered pyrochlore
phase (OPP) known to exist in the Fd3m space group exhibits close structural resemblance
to the fluorite phase except that there are two cationic sites and
three anionic sites (i.e., 48f(OI), 8a(OII),
and 8b(OIII)) with one-eighth of the oxygen ions (OIII) at the 8b site absent in the OPP. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy
provides unambiguous information in determining whether a synthesized
A2B2O7 sample exists in an OPP or
a DFP structure.

On the basis of the group theory, it is well
documented in the literature that there are a total of six Raman-active
vibrational modes for OPP existing in the wavenumber range of 200–1000
cm–1, specifically, ΓOPP = A1g + Eg + 4F2g. On the other hand, the
DFP has mainly one active Raman mode, that is ΓDFP = F2g, because the seven O2– ions are
randomly oriented over the eight anionic sites in this particular
phase, leading to a high level of structural disordering.37,38 Phase transition from the OPP (Fd3̅m (A2B2O6O′, space
group, Z = 8) to DFP (AO2, Fm3̅m, Z = 4)) proceeds by
the disappearance of A1g and Eg Raman modes
and decrease in the number of F2g mode from 4 to 1. The
ionic radius ratio (rA/rB) plays an important role in determining the type of
structure that the A2B2O7 composition
is going to attain.39 It is reported that
if rA/rB is
less than 1.46 the fluorite phase is more likely to form and if rA/rB exceeds 1.46
the ordered pyrochlore phase is more likely to get stabilized at room
temperature. It was proposed that rA/rB follows this trend for different A2B2O7 compositions: DFP rA/rB < 1.21 < Δ-phase rA/rB < 1.42–1.44
< OPP rA/rB < 1.78–1.83 < monoclinic pyrochlore rA/rB < 1.92.40 La2Hf2O7 is
one of the most favorable candidates with an ionic radius ratio of
1.45 to be stabilized in OPP. As observed from the Raman spectra (Figure 1), except for the
LHO-1h and LHOE-1h samples, six vibrational modes related to the La–O
and Hf–O vibrational frequency were clearly identified for
all other La2Hf2O7 samples. It may
happen that these two samples have not been sufficiently processed
for the pyrochlore network to be fully evolved, even though some of
the characteristic spectral signatures of an ideal pyrochlore have
started to appear around 320, 400, and 520 cm–1.
The peak positions for the other La2Hf2O7 NPs are around 304, 321, 401, 506, 520, and 610 cm–1, which correspond to F2g, Eg, F2g, A1g, F2g, and F2g.41 The vibrational Raman bands of F2g, Eg, and F2g modes at a low wavenumber region
(300–400 cm–1) originate from vibrations
of the La–O and Hf–O bonds, whereas the F2g modes at high wavenumbers (522 and 641 cm–1) come
into picture due to stretching of the Hf–O bonds. There is
a small kink around 750 cm–1, which is attributed
to the distortion of HfO6 octahedral geometry.41 The Raman spectroscopy data acquired suggested
that the as-synthesized La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs are indeed in the pyrochlore phase based on the observed
six typical Raman-active vibrational modes existing in the wavenumber
range of 200–1000 cm–1. On the other hand,
a defect fluorite phase only processes one active vibrational mode.
This mode usually occurs at ∼300 cm–1 similar
to the naturally occurring defect fluorite rare-earth hafnate.42 There are not much appreciable differences in
the Raman spectra of the Eu3+-doped La2Hf2O7 samples (Figure 1b) from their undoped counterparts, indicating that
europium doping does not alter the basic pyrochlore network of lanthanum
hafnate.

Raman peaks for the samples with the MSS processing duration of 3
h.

2.2 XRD Patterns
and Refinement
Differentiation
of the structures of DFP (Fm3®m) and OPP (Fd3®m) using X-ray
diffraction (XRD) is very difficult because of their phase resemblance
within the cubic structure family. XRD in most cases using a Cu Kα
source in common research labs fails to detect weaker superlattice
reflections of the pyrochlore phase. A stronger source such as synchrotron
radiation is needed to resolve the very weak lattice reflection. As
reported in the literature43,44 pertaining to the Rietveld
refinement of the pyrochlore phase La2Zr2O7 and La2Hf2O7, a synchrotron
X-ray source is really needed. More
specifically, these superlattice reflections are relatively strong
in the neutron patterns, likely a consequence of the greater relative
sensitivity of neutrons to O atoms in the presence of Hf and Ln atoms.
For this reason, our lab XRD instrument identified only the defect
fluorite phase from our LHO and LHOE NPs, which should not be considered
as a discrepancy with the Raman data (Figure 1). In our case, we have used XRD to confirm
that our samples are free of impurities and to estimate their particle
size.

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the La2Hf2O7 and La2Hf2O7:5.0%Eu3+ powder samples synthesized at 650 °C by the MSS method
with various processing durations. No visible impurity phases such
as La2O3, Eu2O3, and HfO2 were detected. Meanwhile, it is well known that the presence
of weak reflections due to the ordered pyrochlore phase (OPP) cannot
be ruled out, as they are sometimes not detected in Cu Kα-based
XRD. Therefore, the ideal scenario would be probing the crystal phase
of these samples using laser-based Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron
X-ray diffraction, or neutron diffraction. Here, all of the XRD patterns
and the corresponding 2θ angles and (hkl) indexes
are in agreement with reported XRD pattern of La2Hf2O7 (JCPDS No. 78-1292). When comparing the undoped
and europium-doped samples, the results indicate that doping does
not change the crystal structure of the La2Hf2O7 host. In addition, changing the MSS processing duration
did not change the crystal structure of the prepared NPs.

of (a) undoped and (b) 5% Eu3+-doped La2Hf2O7 NPs as a function of the MSS processing
duration varying from 1 to 12 h.

The determined particle size is given in Table 1, which displays the lattice
parameter and
particle size as a function of the MSS processing duration for both
the undoped and doped La2Hf2O7 samples.
As far as the lattice parameter is concerned, as the MSS processing
duration increases, there is not much change in the case of the undoped
La2Hf2O7 samples, but the lattice
parameter decreases in the case of the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ samples.

LHOE-12h	28.67	0.33	10.77	24.1 ± 0.7	
Regarding the particle size,
it can be seen that there is an increase
with an increase in the MSS processing duration. The increased particle
size is a result of the longer MSS processing time to allow the continuous
growth of the NPs. Furthermore, it can be seen that the particle size
decreases after doping La2Hf2O7 with
5% Eu3+ at the same MSS processing duration. On doping
a foreign ion into a crystal lattice, the crystallite size is reduced
because of the lattice distortion caused by the difference in the
ionic radius of the dopant and the original ion replaced.45 There is also a possibility that a fraction
of the Eu3+ dopants substitutes the Hf4+ sites,
which leads to the creation of oxygen vacancies and consequently significant
strain and reduction in particle size in the La2Hf2O7 lattice.46

To rule out the formation of any metastable state in the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs by the MSS
at a relatively low temperature of 650 °C, the Rietveld refinement
of the XRD data and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried
out using LHO-6h and LHOE-6h NPs as representatives. The Rietveld-refined
XRD patterns of these two samples are shown in Figure 3a,b. The lattice parameter, cell volume,
space group, and bond angle estimated from the refinement along with
other refinement parameters are tabulated in Table S1. Our original XRD data were fitted well by the Rietveld
refinement with the fluorite structure instead of the pyrochlore phase
with superlattice reflection. The crystal structure of the LHO-6h
and LHOE-6h NPs (Figure S1) is in agreement
with previous reports for La2Hf2O7.47 The estimated uncertainty on the lattice
parameter is 10.773 ± 0.001 from the LHO-6h NPs and 10.765 ±
0.001 from the LHOE-6h NPs (Table S1).
It can also be seen that doping Eu3+ into the La2Hf2O7 lattice does not distort its basic fluorite
network, which can be easily visualized from Figures 4 and S1b. The
chemical content of the unit cell is 16.0000 La + 48.0002 O + 16.0000
Hf + 8.0001 O. The normalized site occupation numbers in percentage
are 100.0000 La1:100.0004(2) O2:100.0000 Hf3:100.0012(4) O4. A summary
of the obtained results from the Rietveld refinements is shown in Table S2.

NPs.

of the LHOE NPs
as a function of the MSS processing duration: (a) 1 h, (b) 3 h, (c)
6 h, (d) 9 h, and (e) 12 h.

As the MSS processing duration increased from 1 to 12 h,
SEM images
(Figure 4) confirmed
that the particle size of the LHOE NPs kept increasing, which is consistent
with the calculated values from the XRD data (Figure 2 and Table 1). Moreover, the particles look spherical at a short
MSS processing duration but they tend to form large clusters and finally
agglomerate at longer MSS processing times of 9 and 12 h. The particle
size distribution of the LHOE NPs was calculated by ImageJ from these
SEM images (Figure S2). There is a progressing
enhancement of the obtained mean diameter of these LHOE NPs from 19
to 50 nm as the MSS processing time increased from 1 to 12 h. The
representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the
LHOE-6h NPs clearly shows that the synthesized NPs have well-defined
morphology (Figure S3) and their size is
in a nanometer range with uniform distribution.

2.3 TGA Measurements
TGA data (Figure 5) were also collected
to rule out the possible formation of any metastable state in the
LHO and LHOE NPs synthesized by the MSS method. There is barely any
weight change from the LHO-6h and LHOE-6h NPs other than the initial
weight loss due to physisorbed water molecules and residual nitrate
ions from the molten salt. Both samples are very stable throughout
the temperature range up to 1000 °C. This again suggested the
thermal stability of the La2Hf2O7 NPs for potential high-temperature applications such as nuclear
waste host, thermal barrier coatings, and luminescence host.

2.4 Excitation and Emission Spectra of Photoluminescence
From the excitation spectra of the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs processed by MSS at 650 °C
for different time intervals (Figure 6a), we could see a broad band ranging from 220 to 320
nm, and there are several very fine features from 350 to 500 nm. Such
a broad band is attributed to the allowed charge transfer state (CTS)
with three possible origins: (a) host absorption band due to electronic
transition from O2– → Hf4+, (b)
intervalence charge transfer between Hf4+ and Eu3+, and (c) the predominant contribution would be due to electron transfer
from O2– → Eu3+.48−50 The fine structure in the region of 350–500 nm is attributed
to the intra f–f transition of Eu3+ ions with peaks
at 362, 383, 395, 414, and 464 nm assigned to 7F0 → 5D4, 7F0 → 5G2–4, 7F0 → 5L6, 7F0 → 5D3, and 7F0 → 5D2, respectively. Among them, the intensities of the 395
nm (near UV) and 464 nm (blue light) peaks are the highest. This indicated
that our La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs have the ability to be effectively pumped by far UV, mid UV,
near UV, blue light, and green light for being used as a phosphor.
From all of our La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs synthesized by the MSS route, we could see that the
photoluminescence excitation (PLE) intensity of the f–f band
is higher than that of the CTS. This is very unusual and highly desirable
because intuitively the f–f transition is forbidden in nature,
whereas the CTS is an allowed transition. This can be attributed to
two reasons: (i) overlap of the CTS and the absorption band of the
host51 and (ii) the forbidden 4f–4f
transition “steals” some intensity from the allowed
CTS transition.52 Excitation lines originating
from the 7F0 → 5L6 (≈395 nm) and 7F0 → 5D2 (≈464 nm) transitions are highly suitable as
color converters in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) because they overlap
very well with the emission spectra of efficient near-UV and blue
LEDs, respectively.53 However, there is
no perfect correlation between the MSS processing duration and the
variation in the wavelength position of the CTS maxima of our LHOE
NPs (Figure 6b). Initially,
the LHOE-1h sample with the smallest particle size displayed the maximum
blue shift compared to that in the LHOE-3h sample, indicating the
widening of band gap. From the LHOE-3h sample to the LHOE-6h sample
and then to the LHOE-9h sample, the CTS maxima exhibited a blue shift
although there is a continuous increase in particle size. Finally,
there was a red shift in the CTS maxima from the LHOE-9h sample to
the LHOE-12h sample. The lack of perfect correlation between the CTS
maxima and the MSS processing duration can be attributed to the fact
that there were accompanying structural changes along with the MSS
processing duration and particle size variation. Although the reason
is unknown, further control of the identity of these particles by
proper synthesis procedures and detailed investigation by various
characterization techniques are guaranteed. Moreover, such observation
in this case cannot be attributed to quantum confinement, which is
normally observed when nanoparticles are sufficiently small, typically
10 nm or less. Such a phenomenon is more prevalent in systems with
simple energy-level diagrams, such as metal or
semiconductor nanoparticles. Pyrochlore oxides, such as La2Hf2O7, have complex band diagrams: the valence
band (VB) is mainly contributed from O 2p, whereas the conduction
band (CB) has contributions from Hf 4d, La 4d, and La 4f states.

Figure 6 (a) Excitation
spectra and (b) variation of the CTS maxima of the
La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs as a
function of the MSS processing duration varying from 1 to 12 h.

The La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs processed by MSS for different
durations displayed similar emission
spectral features of the Eu3+ ion after being excited at
265 nm (Figure 7a).
The peaks at 579, 592, 612, 655, and 710 nm are related to the 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1 (magnetic dipole
transition, MDT, ΔJ = ±1), 5D0 → 7F2 (hypersensitive
electric dipole transition, EDT, ΔJ = ±2), 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions,
respectively. A few important observations can be made from these
emission spectra: (i) appearance of the 5D0 → 7F0 transition, (ii) significant stark splitting
of the 5D0 → 7F1 (MDT), 5D0 → 7F2 (hypersensitive EDT), and 5D0 → 7F4 (EDT) transitions, and (iii) higher intensity
of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition than that of the 5D0 → 7F1 transition. The intensity of the 5D0 → 7F1 MDT peak at 592
nm is independent of the local environment of the Eu3+ ion.
On the other hand, the intensity of the hypersensitive EDT peak is
easily affected by the local symmetry/environment of Eu3+ ions and the crystal field induced by surrounding ligands. The ratio
of integral areas of the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions, known as asymmetry factor, gives information
related to the local symmetry of Eu3+ ions in hosts. The
origins of certain transitions, such as 5D0 → 7F0 and 5D0 → 7F3, are governed by neither MDT nor EDT. Their
appearance in an emission spectrum indicated a highly asymmetric environment
around the europium ion. Therefore, we concluded that the Eu3+ ions in the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs are localized in a highly asymmetric and distorted environment.

Figure 7 (a) Emission
spectra and (b) variation of the integral emission
intensity of the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs as a function of the MSS processing duration varied
from 1 to 12 h.

In fact, on the basis
of the selection rule allowed for electric
dipole, the 5D0 → 7F0 transition is allowed only with point group symmetry designated
as Cs, C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C2v, C3v, C4v, and C6v.54 On the basis of the splitting pattern in the
emission characteristics of our La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs, there is no splitting observed in the 5D0 → 7F0 transition.
By Gaussian deconvolution of the 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions, the numbers of stark components were found to
be 3, 2, 2, and 3, respectively (Figure 8). This phenomenon suggests the C4v point group symmetry for Eu3+ ions in our doped La2Hf2O7 NPs,
whereas the actual symmetry of both A and B sites of A2B2O7 compounds is D3d.55 The reduction of the
symmetry of Eu3+ ions in the La2Hf2O7 host of these NPs could be induced by the lattice strain
due to the mismatch of the ionic radii of La3+ and Eu3+ ions. It is also possible that the 5.0% Eu3+ ions
are not entirely stabilized at the La3+ site in the host
lattice. In other words, some of the Eu3+ ions may get
localized at the Hf4+ site, which invokes the need for
charge compensation by oxygen vacancies. Such defects in the vicinity
of Eu3+ ions further reduce the local structural symmetry
of the Eu3+ ions. Moreover, the hypersensitive EDT band
is more intense than the MDT band, which also indicates the lower
symmetry of the Eu3+ ion. In fact, the LHOE-3h sample has
the maximum asymmetry ratio and maximum emission intensity (Table 2 and Figure 7b). By correlating the asymmetry
ratio with the particle size/surface defects of our La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs, there are two ways
to look into this phenomenon. The highest asymmetry ratio from the
LHOE-3h sample suggests a highly asymmetric local environment around
the Eu3+ ions compared with other LHOE samples. Therefore,
Laporte’s selection rules are more relaxed for the LHOE-3h
sample compared with the other samples, which means higher transition
probability as well as oscillator strength for the f–f transition,
leading to enhanced emission output.56 Second,
this phenomenon can also be explained in terms of size/surface defects.
The LHOE-3h sample has minimal surface defects and least agglomeration
that favor high radiative transition and low scattering of excited
and emitted light, respectively, leading to high luminescence output.25,57 The PL emission enhancement up to 3 h MSS processing duration can
be ascribed to the reduction in nonradiative pathways as a result
of reduction in surface defects with the increased particle size.
Beyond 3 h MSS processing duration, the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs tend to agglomerate, which may
cause scattering of the emitted light and therefore reduction in emission
intensity. These observations could be explained on the basis of our
SEM results (Figure 4). Figure 9 schematically
shows the progressive increase in particle size along the increasing
MSS processing duration, which reflects the increased particle size
but reduced surface defects.

Furthermore, the application
of X-ray-excited luminescence (XEL)
has been explored for scintillating and bioimaging purposes, which
require bright luminescent particles. Studies related to the variation
of the radioluminescence output of the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs as a function of the MSS processing
duration will give highly useful information with respect to the optimized
processing time of Eu3+ ions for X-ray luminescence. The
emission spectra under X-ray excitation with the power of 12 W (Figure 10a) display typical
spectral features of the Eu3+ ions similar to those obtained
under UV excitation (Figure 7a). The X-ray luminescence from the LHOE-3h sample was the
brightest among all of the samples we studied (Figure 10b).

La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs, (b)

High-energy X-rays are produced
by events that occur to disrupt
the nuclear stability of atoms. Radiation having lower energy, such
as ultraviolet, originates from the electron clouds that surround
the nucleus or from the interaction of one atom with another. These
forms of radiation occur due to the fact that electrons moving in
orbits around the nucleus of an atom are arranged in different energy
levels within their probability distribution functions. When a sample
is excited by energetic X-ray beams, a large number of free charge
carriers or excitons (bound state of e– and h+ pairs) are generated in the crystal lattice because of the
photoelectric effect. In the case of La2Hf2O7, there are two crystallographic sites: eight-coordinated
La3+ and six-coordinated Hf4+ sites. On the
basis of the UV luminescence decay measurement, it was found that
the Eu3+ ions are localized at both La3+ (EuLa) and Hf4+ sites (EuHf′). The Eu3+ ions occupying
Hf4+ sites may lead to the generation of negative antisite
defects (EuHf′) and positive oxygen vacancy defects (VÖ) as indicated below by the Kroger–Vink notation.  UV-excited PL spectra displayed both EDT and
MDT (Figure 7a). EDT
is attributed to EuHf′, whereas MDT is attributed to EuLa. As
discussed earlier, the Eu3+ ions get distributed at both
the La3+ and Hf4+ sites in the La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs. For La2Hf2O7, the valence band (VB) is composed of
O 2p orbitals hybridized with Hf 5d orbitals along with a minor contribution
from La 4f states.25,58 On the other hand, the conduction
band (CB) is mainly composed of La 4d states (in majority spin component),
4f states (in minority spin component), and Hf 5d states. Hf 5d states
contribute solely to the lower part of the conduction band.

The EuHf′ defects are XEL-active and amenable to emission under X-ray excitation.
This is similar to what Dobrowolska et al. have observed in europium-doped
barium hafnate.59 Excitation with an energetic
12 W X-ray beam leads to the formation of excitons (bound electron–hole
pairs) between electrons in the lower part of the CB comprising Hf
5d states (5d1 Hf3+) and holes in the VB, if
they possess similar momentum. The energy absorbed by excitons can
be transported through the La2Hf2O7 lattice. They will be trapped in the EuHf′ defect sites, and then radiative
recombination is followed. The 5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F1 ratio (IAR) indicates a
local crystal
structure surrounding the doped Eu3+ ions. For the same
LHOE-3h sample, the X-ray-excited
luminescence shows an IAR value of 2.57,
which is much lower as compared to that for the UV-excited luminescence
(3.99). This indicated that the crystal symmetry surrounding the Eu3+ ions under X-ray excitation was predominantly from a high-symmetry
site compared with that under UV excitation. This is due to the contribution
of both EuLa and EuHf′ to the UV-excited luminescence, whereas
only EuHf′ contributes to X-ray-excited luminescence.

Furthermore, the
emitted photon counts corresponding to green and
red emission under the UV excitation (Figure 7) are much larger than the ones under X-ray
excitation (Figure 10). La2Hf2O7 is a material with high
dielectric constant, and excitons formed in these cases on exposure
to ionizing radiation such as X-ray are weakly bonded and are known
as Wannier–Mott-type excitons.60 They break easily on collision with phonons. The number of excitons
thus available for energy transfer to Eu3+ ions is small
and hence low RL output. On the other hand, under UV excitation of
265 nm, the La2Hf2O7 host absorbs
the energy and transfers it to radiative Eu3+ centers directly.
This is known as host-sensitized energy transfer.

2.5 Potential Red-Emitting Phosphor Excitable
by Various Lights
Commercial red phosphors for near-ultraviolet
(NUV)-based white light-emitting diodes are excited by NUV or blue
LEDs. On the basis of the Laporte selection rules, the intra f–f
transitions are forbidden in nature; therefore, Eu3+-based
phosphors have poor absorptivity in the near-ultraviolet/blue region.
As a result, they exhibit weaker emission under similar excitation.
Because the excitation spectra of our samples are very rich in near-,
mid-, and far-UV regions as well as blue and green regions, they exhibit
intense red emission corresponding to the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions under excitations by far UV (at 200 nm), mid UV (at 265 nm),
near UV (at 393 nm), blue light (at 463 nm), and green light (at 534
nm) (Figure 11). Such
intense red-emitting NPs can be explored for white LEDs based on phosphor-converted
LEDs, wherein blue LEDs are combined with red and green phosphors.

2.6 Luminescence
Decay Behavior
We studied
the PL lifetime decay behavior corresponding to the 5D0 state of Eu3+ ions in the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs, which is shown in Figure S4. The LHOE-1h sample exhibited monoexponential
decay. The unusual behavior of the LHOE-1h sample is attributed to
the fact that Eu3+ ions must not have entered the lattice
site (either La or Hf site) at all and were sitting on the surface
of the formed NPs, as we suggested on the basis of the PLE data. All
other LHOE samples demonstrated bi-exponential behavior based on the
exponential fitting equation given below 1  where I(t) is the intensity at time t, T1, and T2 are luminescence
lifetimes, and A1 and A2 are their relative magnitudes. For all other samples,
it is possible that Eu3+ ions have been stabilized at two
different lattice sites in the La2Hf2O7 host. The fitted lifetime values and their relative percentage for
all samples are tabulated in Table 3. Unlike in Nd2Zr2O7:Eu3+, we could not find any splitting in the 5D0–7F0 transition at room
temperature.61 This may get resolved at
a very low temperature close to that of liquid N2. The
presence of more than one spectral peak in the 5D0 → 7F0 transition shows that more than
one site or species is present, but it does not allow the determination
of the exact number of sites or species because the sites or species
with a symmetry other than Cnv, Cn, or Cs do not
give an observable 5D0 → 7F0 transition.62

LHOE-9h	1.2	2.9	35.0	65.0	
LHOE-12h	1.0	2.9	27.0	73.0	
In a pyrochlore
structure, there are two lattice sites, i.e., the
eight-coordinated La3+ ion site with scalenohedra geometry
and the six-coordinated Hf4+ ion site with distorted octahedral
geometry. The stabilization of the Eu3+ ions at the Hf4+ sites invokes the need for charge compensation by forming
negatively charged antisite defect EuHf′ and positively charged oxygen
vacancies VÖ according to eq 2 2  The long lifetime is mostly associated with
the symmetric La3+ sites, whereas the short one is due
to the asymmetric Hf4+ sites where the f–f transition
rules are relaxed and they become allowed. In our case, the long lifetime
having a higher percentage could be ascribed to the Eu3+ ions sitting at the La3+ sites, whereas the short-lifetime
species is because the Eu3+ ions are localized at the Hf4+ sites. The reason is obviously the closeness of the ionic
radii of the Eu3+ and La3+ ions, and furthermore,
there is no need for charge compensation. Another interesting observation
from Table 3 is that
there is a monotonous increase in the lifetime values for both short-
and long-lived species as a function of the MSS processing duration.
The increase in the lifetime values with the MSS processing time is
ascribed to the reduction of surface defects, which ultimately results
in the reduction of nonradiative transitions in the LHOE NPs.

2.7 Judd–Ofelt
Analysis
Judd–Ofelt
(JO) analysis is one of the most useful techniques to get information
on rare-earth-doped phosphors by correlating the emission spectrum
with the local structure, polarizability, and covalency. In the case
of the europium ion, this hypothesis is valid only when its doped
samples show a pure
magnetic dipole transition. In case of other ions, an invariable absorption
spectrum is used to carry out such analysis. The details of these
calculations have already been reported in one of our earlier studies.63 There are two phenomenal parameters, i.e., Ω2 and Ω4, which are known as short- and long-range
JO parameters. Normally, Ω2 gives information related
to the symmetry, covalency, and polarizability, whereas Ω4 gives information related to the rigidity and viscosity of
the metal–oxygen bond.

Among all of the LHOE samples,
the LHOE-3h sample was found to have the highest Ω2 and Ω4 values. The large Ω2 value
reflects the high covalency around the Eu–O bond and maximum
distortion, and the large Ω4 value indicates the
rigid structure of the Eu–O bond.64 The trend from all of the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NP samples is that Ω2 is greater
than Ω4, which confirms the highly asymmetric environment
around the Eu3+ ions in the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs, which is consistent with the
discussed luminescence data. Therefore, the Judd–Ofelt analysis
also supports our previous interesting observation that the LHOE-3h
sample possesses the best optical properties.

Furthermore, as
can be easily seen from Table 4, the radiative transition
probability was
maximum in the case of the LHOE-3h sample. Accordingly, its nonradiative
transition rate is minimal. This may be attributed to the fact that
the 3 h MSS processing duration is optimum to lower the surface defect
density but not to create agglomerates. From the branching ratio measurements,
we can see that the maximum photon emission from all of the LHOE samples
comes from the red emission at 612 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F2 transition. Interestingly,
β2 is the highest for LHOE-3h (Table 4), which suggests that the red emission intensity
is maximum for the LHOE-3h sample. On the other hand, its β1 is the lowest, which indicated that the optical purity of
red
emission for this sample would be very high due to the least contribution
from orange emission at 593 nm.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the europium-doped lanthanum hafnate
(La2Hf2O7:Eu3+) nanoparticles
with an ordered pyrochlore phase structure could be successfully prepared
at 650 °C by a molten salt synthesis method for various durations.
The emission output and quantum yield were found to be the highest
for the MSS-processed sample for 3 h owing to its least surface defect
and least agglomeration. The emission spectrum revealed the predominant
asymmetric environment of Eu3+ ions with large spectral
splitting and the presence of the forbidden 5D0 → 7F0 transition. The optical purity
of red emission was also very high for the LHOE-3h NPs because of
the least contribution among all of the LHOE samples from orange emission
at 593 nm as seen from the branching ratio calculations. The large
spectral splitting could be seen in the reduction of point group symmetry
from D2d to C4v because of the created lattice strain
and distortion due to the localization of the Eu3+ ions
at La3+/Hf4+ sites. The synthesized nanoparticles
displayed a unique ability of emitting bright red light under far-UV
to green light excitations. These La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ nanoparticles were further explored for their
applications as radioluminescent phosphors. Interestingly, the synthesized
La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs have
the ability to converting highly energetic X-ray into red light, which
highlights its suitability for X-ray scintillators. Our results indicate
the important role that the molten salt synthesis processing duration
plays in optimizing nanophosphors for optoelectronic applications.
This work opens a new pathway to optimize the molten salt synthesis
conditions suitably for getting highly efficient luminescent materials
for phosphor and scintillator applications.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Synthesis of La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs
In this study, we synthesized
the La2Hf2O7:5.0%Eu3+ NPs
through the facile MSS method as reported before but
with various processing durations (from 1 to 12 h) instead of the
standard 6 h.4,13,16,36 The chemicals used are all of analytical
grade and were used without any further purification. Lanthanum nitrate
hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O,
99.0%), hafnium dichloride oxide octahydrate (HfOCl2·8H2O, 99.0%), and europium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Eu(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9%) were first measured
in stoichiometric ratio and dissolved in water (Millipore, 18.2 mΩ
at 25 °C). After 30 min of stirring, 200 mL of ammonium hydroxide
was titrated into the mixture solution dropwise within ∼2 h.
This first step allows the formation of a single-source precursor
via a co-precipitation technique. In the next step, potassium nitrate
(KNO3, 99.9%), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 98%),
and the formed single-source precursor were mixed in a ratio of 30:30:1
and grinded together into fine powder. The fine powder was then MSS-processed
at 650 °C for various hours, more specifically, 1, 3, 6, 9, and
12 h, as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesized La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs were finally washed multiple times with deionized
water to remove any residual salt from the surface of the obtained
NPs. On the basis of the MSS processing durations, the La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs were denoted LHOE-1h,
LHOE-3h, LHOE-6h, LHOE-9h, and LHOE-12h, respectively. Similarly,
undoped La2Hf2O7 NP counterparts
were synthesized and labeled as LHO-1h, LHO-3h, LHO-6h, LHO-9h, and
LHO-12h, respectively. On the basis of the authors’ experience,
the MSS method allows for a size-controllable synthesis of these A2B2O7 refractory metal oxide NPs at a
relatively low temperature while ensuring no fluorite–pyrochlore
phase transformation.4,13,16,36

MSS Method at 650 °C
with Various Processing Durations
4.2 Characterization
All synthesized
La2Hf2O7:5%Eu3+ NPs were
systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence
(PL), radioluminescence (RL), fluorescence decay, quantum yield, and
time-resolved emission spectroscopy. Powder XRD was used to distinguish
any unwanted impurities, if any, remained from the synthesized La2Hf2O7:5.0%Eu3+ NPs. This
characterization was measured by a BRUKER D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer
with a Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 40
kV, 40 mA), with a scanning mode in the 2θ range of 10–90°
and a scanning step size
of 0.04° at a scanning rate of 2.0°/min. Rietveld refinement
was carried out using PROGRAM FullProf.2k (version 6.00, Mar2017-ILL
JRC) by varying the cell parameters; position of the La, Hf, and O
atoms; occupancy; and thermal parameters. We calculated the crystallite
size of these NPs from their XRD data using the Debye–Scherer
formula 3  where d is the crystallite
size, λ is the wavelength of the used X-ray, and θ is
the angle of the corresponding Bragg reflection, which was fitted
to calculate the full width at half-maximum (FWHM). B is the FWHM in radian, and k is a Scherer constant.
The value of the Scherer constant was calculated earlier by Scherer
as 0.94 based on cubic crystallites. Later, Klug and Alexander had
done a simplified calculation of the
Scherer equation, which gives the value 0.89.65 Here, the BM was calculated using the
FWHM value of the nearby highest-intensity peak of pure silicon. FWMH
of Bs was determined based on the XRD
peak with the highest intensity at 29.7°, and fitting was done
using the pseudo-Voigt function. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was done with a TA instruments SDT-Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer
with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in air. To confirm the crystal
structure of the NPs, we used a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw-2000,
Renishaw, Inc.) with the 514 nm line of an Ar ion laser having a power
of about 5 mW. Emission and excitation spectra were recorded using
an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980 fluorometer system having a steady-state
xenon lamp source. On the other hand, the lifetime was measured with
a pulsed microsecond xenon lamp source having a frequency range of
1–100 Hz using the time-correlated single-photon counting technique.
A 150 mm BenFlect coated integrating sphere was employed to measure
the absolute quantum yield. The spectral sensitivity of the spectrometer
and the sphere was modified using a calibrated lamp for spectral light
throughput. Finally, RL spectra were acquired with a silver X-ray
source tube built in to the Edinburgh Instruments
FLS 980 fluorometer system at a power of 12 W (60 kV and 200 μA).
