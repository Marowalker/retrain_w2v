The MS-CASPT2 method has been employed
to optimize minimum-energy
structures of 6-selenoguanine (6SeGua) and related two- and three-state
intersection structures in and between the lowest five electronic
states, i.e., S2(1ππ*), S1(1nπ*), T2(3nπ*), T1(3ππ*),
and S0. In combination with MS-CASPT2 calculated linearly
interpolated internal coordinate paths, the photophysical mechanism
of 6SeGua has been proposed. The initially populated S2(1ππ*) state decays to either S1(1nπ*) or T2(3nπ*) states through a three-state S2/S1/T2 intersection point. The large S2/T2 spin–orbit coupling of 435 cm–1, according to the classical El-Sayed rule, benefits the S2 → T2 intersystem crossing process. The S1(1nπ*) state that stems from the
S2 → S1 internal conversion process at
the S2/S1/T2 intersection point can
further jump to the T2(3nπ*)
state through the S1 → T2 intersystem
crossing process. This process does not comply with the El-Sayed rule,
but it is still related to a comparatively large spin–orbit
coupling of 39 cm–1 and is expected to occur relatively
fast. Finally, the T2(3nπ*)
state, which is populated from the above S2 → T2 and S1 → T2 intersystem crossing
processes, decays to the T1(3ππ*)
state via an internal conversion process. Because there is merely
a small energy barrier of 0.11 eV separating the T1(3ππ*) minimum and an energetically allowed two-state
T1/S0 intersection point, the T1(3ππ*) state still can decay to the S0 state quickly, which is also enhanced by a large T1/S0 spin–orbit coupling of 252 cm–1.
Our proposed mechanism explains experimentally observed ultrafast
intersystem crossing processes in 6SeGua and its 835-fold acceleration
of the T1 state decay to the S0 state compared
with 6tGua. Finally, we have found that the ground-state electronic
structure of 6SeGua has more apparent multireference character.

Introduction
Nucleobases are the
basic chromophores in deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). They have important properties shared
by all these nucleobases, namely their photostability when interaction
with ultraviolet light, which prevents photodamages.1,2 Time-resolved experiments and high-level theoretical studies have
shown that nucleobases in the gas phase and in solution adopt similar
ultrafast radiationless decay processes via energetically efficient
conical intersections, which finally deactivate nucleobases from their
initially populated excited singlet to ground states before harmful
photoreactions take place.3−19

In stark contrast, thio-substituted nucleobases have distinctly
different photophysics. A simple O-to-S substitution in these natural
nucleobases largely suppresses internal conversion to the ground state
and instead allows efficient intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet
state.20−30 This is qualitatively different from excited-state behaviors of
natural nucleobases in which internal conversion to the ground state
is a predominant deactivation channel that protects them from harmful
photodamages. To rationalize these intriguing photophysical phenomena
and figure out the underlying physical origins, a lot of high-level
electronic structure calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations
have been carried out in the past several years, and several efficient
intersystem crossing channels have been proposed to explain such ultrahigh
quantum yields for the formation of triplet states in experiments.31−40

In addition to natural and thio-substituted nucleobases, experimental
scientists have recently focused on seleno-substituted nucleobases
due to their potential applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic
therapy.41−44 Recently, Farrell and co-workers have used time-resolved absorption
spectroscopies to explore the excited-state relaxation dynamics of
6-selenoguanine (6SeGua).45 Compared with
its thio-substituted analogue, selenium substitution remarkably enhances
relevant intersystem crossing rates to and from triplet manifolds
and meanwhile leads to a short-lived triplet state. Given the similarities
between theoretical and experimental results for 6SeGua and 6tGua,
they suggest that the initially populated S2(1ππ*) state will first convert to the dark S1(1nπ*) state, which is followed
by intersystem crossing to the T2(3nπ*) and/or T1(3ππ*) state.
Furthermore, the triplet state deactivation has been suggested to
increase by 835-fold in comparison with that of 6-thioguanine (6tGua).
Farrell et al. have ascribed this acceleration of 1.7 vs 1420 ns,
in addition to the stronger T1/S0 spin–orbit
coupling in 6SeGua, to a smaller energy barrier to access the T1(1ππ*) potential energy region where
the T1 → S0 intersystem crossing process
takes place. As a consequence, the short triplet-state lifetime of
6SeGua makes it less efficient to sensitize molecular oxygen to generate
singlet oxygen than 6tGua. To shed light on the clear and
detailed photophysical mechanism of 6SeGua behind these spectroscopic
phenomena, a highly accurate electronic structure calculations are
useful.

Computationally, to the best of our knowledge, local
spectroscopic
and excited-state properties of selenium-substituted thymidine and
deoxyguanosine have been studied with density functional theory (DFT)
and time-dependent (TD)-DFT methods.46−48 For selenium-substituted
deoxyguanosine, possible excited-state relaxation pathways have been
proposed based on TD-DFT optimized excited-state minima and related
energies.48 Nonetheless, besides these
excited-state geometries and energies, it is also necessary to investigate
their accessibility from the initially populated singlet states. In
addition, intersection structures and energies among involved excited
states are also very important and not explored before. The determination
of quasi-degenerate structures could not be accurate enough with single-reference
methods and thus calls for multiconfigurational electronic structure
methods. Taken together, we have, in this work, employed a highly
accurate MS-CASPT2 method to optimize equilibrium geometries in the
lowest five electronic states, i.e., S0, S2(1ππ*), S1(1nπ*), T2(3nπ*),
and T1(1ππ*), and to calculate linear
interpolation internal coordinate (LIIC) paths connecting these minima
and crossing points. On the basis of the present results, a possible
excited-state relaxation mechanism is proposed to explain recent experimental
studies.

Results and Discussion
Local Spectroscopic Properties
Figure 1 shows the MS-CASPT2-optimized
minimum-energy
structure in the S0 state. It is clear that the structure
is totally planar and the C2=Se1 bond length is calculated
to be 1.821 Å, much longer than the typical C=O and C=S
double bonds but a little shorter than 1.839 Å predicted by the
DFT method for selenium-substituted deoxyguanosine. Our MS-CASPT2
predicted C9–N10 bond length, 1.322 Å, is longer than
1.310 Å estimated by the DFT method. Interestingly, the S0 state has a very remarkable multireference character in that
electronic structure analysis at the MS-CASPT2 level shows that in
addition to the closed-shell electronic configuration, i.e., 2222220000
with 0.77 weight, there is a comparable open-shell electronic configuration,
i.e., 22222ud000 with 0.11 weight. This multireference ground-state
property also makes its C7–C11 bond length much longer than
those predicted for natural Gua and 6tGua by the CASPT2 method (1.410
Å vs 1.369 Å vs 1.367 Å).11,31

Vertical excitation energies and
associated electronic structures
at the Franck–Condon point are very important for us to understand
the excited-state relaxation mechanism and we have thus explored these
local spectroscopic properties at the above MS-CASPT2-optimized S0 minimum. At this Franck–Condon point, the spectroscopically
“bright” electronically excited singlet state is the
second excited singlet state, i.e., S2 (oscillator strength:
ca. 0.24). The electronic configuration that is mainly responsible
for this S0 → S2 electronic transition
corresponds to an electron excited from AS-6 to AS-7 (i.e., 22222ud000;
weight: 0.628). The AS-6 and AS-7 orbitals are of π character.
The former one has a large contribution from the C2–Se1 moiety;
in contrast, the latter is more delocalized than AS-6 (see Figure 2). Its vertical excitation
energy is calculated to be 3.39 eV (366 nm), which is close to experimentally
measured 3.47 eV (357 nm). Previous TD-B3LYP calculations predict
3.60 eV (341 nm).48 This good agreement
demonstrates that our chosen electronic structure method is accurate
enough for the description of excited states of our studied system.

Figure 2 Molecular
orbitals are used as the active space (AS-X) in all of
the MS-CASPT2 calculations in this work. Also, shown are the character
of these molecular orbitals.

There exists a spectroscopically “dark” excited
singlet
state that is lower than the above S2 state in energy.
This S1 state is mainly caused by the electronic transition
of an electron from AS-5 to AS-7 as shown in Figure 2 and thus is of 1nπ* character. Its vertical excitation energy is predicted to
be 2.61 eV at the MS-CASPT2 level, 0.78 eV lower than the S2 state at the Franck–Condon point. However, the predicted
TD-B3LYP calculations merely give 3.10 eV (400 nm), which is 0.49
eV higher than the MS-CASPT2 predicted one.48

Furthermore, there are two triplet states below both S2 and S1 states in energy, which are referred to
as T1 and T2. The T1 and T2 states
have similar electronic configurations to those of S2 and
S1 (see Table 1) and therefore are of 3ππ* and 3nπ* characters, respectively. The vertical
excitation energies of these two triplet states are calculated to
be 2.40 and 2.56 eV, respectively, which are lower than the TD-B3LYP
estimated to be 2.50 and 2.90 eV, respectively.48 It is meaningful to see that both T1 and T2 states are close to 2.61 eV of the S1 state, which
is important for the excited-state relaxation among these three excited
states.

Excited-State Minima
Figure 3 shows the MS-CASPT2-optimized minimum-energy
structures in the lowest excited singlet and triplet states, i.e.,
S1, S2, T1, and T2. As
discussed above, the S2 state is mainly caused by the electronic
configuration from AS-6 to AS-7 as shown in Figure 2; it is thus natural to expect an elongation
of the C2–Se1 bond because there is an antibonding character
between the C2 and Se1 atoms in the AS-7 orbital involved in the electronic
transition leading to the S0 → S2 electronic
transition. This bond length is increased to 2.032 Å at the S2 minimum from 1.821 Å at the S0 minimum, which
is a little longer than 1.999 Å predicted by the TD-B3LYP level.
In addition, the C7–C11, N6–C7, and C4–N6 bond
lengths have some changes from the S0 to S2 minima.
Similarly, the C2-Se1 bond length is also elongated to 1.935 Å
in the S1 minimum because the AS-7 orbital is also involved
in the corresponding electronic transition (from AS-5 to AS-7 in Table 1). The TD-B3LYP method
also gives a similar bond length of 1.917 Å for the C2–Se1.
The other bond lengths, e.g., C2–N3 and N6–C7, are also
increased to some extent. The T2 state is also caused by
the electronic configuration from AS-5 to AS-7 and the T2 minimum is more or less similar to the S1 minimum. The
C2–Se1 bond length is also increased to 1.951 Å at the
T2 minimum (1.940 Å by TD-B3LYP) as well as its C2–N3
bond length. The T1 minimum is structurally different from
the S2 one, although both share similar electronic transitions.
The C2–Se1 bond length also becomes longer in the T1 minimum compared with that in the S0 state (1.944 Å
vs 1.821 Å). In contrast, the TD-B3LYP method predicts a shorter
C2–Se1 bond length of 1.851 Å at the T1 minimum.
In addition, the C2–N3 bond length is also elongated in the
T1 minimum, which is not so remarkable in the S2 minimum. To sum up, the main bond length changes in these S1, S2, T1, and T2 minima in
comparison with the S0 minimum are related to the C2–Se1
bond, which is more than 0.12 Å, even 0.211 in the S2 minimum. By contrast, the others change less than 0.025 Å (see Figure 4).

specific atomistic numbering.

On the energetical side, the MS-CASPT2 energies of the S1, S2, T1, and T2 minima relative
to that of the S0 minimum, i.e., adiabatic excitation energies,
are collected in Table 2. Their adiabatic excitation energies are calculated to be 2.46,
3.04 2.24, and 2.36 eV, respectively, which are lower than their vertical
excitation energies, i.e., 2.61, 3.39, 2.40, and 2.56 eV at the same
computational level (see Table 1). In comparison, previous TD-DFT method gives 2.90, 3.40,
2.40, 2.70 eV for S1, S2, T1, and
T2, respectively.48

Intersection Structures
In addition to minima, three
mechanistically relevant quasi-degenerate three- and two-state intersection
structures have been identified at the MS-CASPT2 level and are referred
to as S2/S1/T2, T2/T1/S0, and T1/S0 in Figure 5. It is worth to
notify that these two three-state crossing points S2/S1/T2 and T2/T1/S0 are not obtained by direct three-state optimization. Instead, the
two-state crossing points S2/S1 and T1/S0 are first optimized and additional single point calculations
reveal that these two-state crossing points S2/S1 and T1/S0 are actually three-state crossing
points. In S2/S1/T2, the C2–Se1
bond is also elongated compared with that in the S0 minimum,
1.899 Å vs 1.821 Å at the MS-CASPT2 level; however, it is
a little shortened in comparison with those in the S1,
S2, T1, and T2 minima (see Figures 3–5). Structurally, the most remarkable change of S2/S1/T1 in comparison with the S1, S2, T1, and T2 minima is
related to the NH2 group attached to the C4 atom, which
is overall perpendicular to the molecular plane (the minima are essentially
planar, see Figure 3). The other bond lengths are also shown in the left panel of Figure 5. Energetically,
at this three-state intersection structure, the S2, S1, and T2 states are highly degenerate in energy
at the MS-CASPT2 level, whose energies are estimated to be 3.23, 3.21,
and 3.21 eV, respectively. These energies are lower than the S2 energy at the Franck–Condon point, 3.39 eV. Therefore,
this S2/S1/T2 intersection should
play an important role in the excited-state relaxation mechanism starting
from the initially populated S2 state (vide infra).

Figure 5 MS-CASPT2 determined
three- and two-state intersection structures,
which are referred to as S2/S1/T2, T2/T1/S0, and T1/S0 (characters of involved electronic states are in parentheses).

Moreover, in T2/T1/S0, the C2–Se1
bond length is significantly elongated up to 2.720 Å, which is
much longer than those in all of the minima and the S2/S1/T2 intersection structure. Different from S2/S1/T2, the NH2 group is
not rotated visibly in T2/T1/S0 (see
other bond lengths in the right panel of Figure 5). Energetically, this T2/T1/S0 intersection structure is estimated to be 3.27/3.17/3.11
eV at the MS-CASPT2 level, which is much higher than those related
to their relevant excited-state minima, 2.36 and 2.24 eV. Since this
T2/T1/S0 intersection structure has
really high energies, the intersystem crossing channel through this
T2/T1/S0 intersection structure to
the S0 state could become inefficient from either T2 or T1 (see below).

We have also optimized
another two-state T1/S0 intersection structure,
which is overall different from the above
two intersection structures. Its Se atom is already out of the molecular
plane as shown in Figure 5. The C2–Se1 bond length is calculated to be 1.934
Å at the MS-CASPT2 level, which is much shorter than 2.720 Å
that in T2/T1/S0. The other bond
lengths are depicted in Figure 5. Importantly, this two-state T1/S0 intersection
has much smaller adiabatic excitation energy compared with that of
T2/T1/S0. The T1 and S0 states’ energies are calculated to be 2.35 and 2.22
eV at the MS-CASPT2 level (T2/T1/S0: 3.27/3.17/3.11 eV; see above), respectively. This comparison could
imply that the two-state intersection could play a more vital role
in the decay of the lowest T1 triplet state.

Excited-State
Relaxation Paths
As mentioned in the
preceding discussion, the S2 state is first populated at
the Franck–Condon point with large probability due to its comparably
larger oscillator strength. After this, the system will relax smoothly
to its S2 minimum without crossing any other relevant electronic
state as demonstrated by the MS-CASPT2 calculated linearly interpolated
internal path (LIIC) as shown in Figure 6. At the S2 minimum, the S2 state is still a little far away from the other S1, T2, and T1 states as evidenced by the calculated
LIIC path connecting both the S2 and S1 minima
(see the left panel of Figure 7); thus, the vibronically assisted internal conversion and
intersystem crossing processes to S1, T2, and
T1 could be inefficient considering the comparable energy
gaps among these excited states. Instead, because of the existence
of an energetically approachable three-state S2/S1/T2 intersection structure, both internal conversion to
S1 and intersystem crossing to T2 become efficient
at this intersection point. Importantly, this three-state intersection
structure is also energetically and structurally accessible. The right
panel of Figure 7 shows
the MS-CASPT2 calculated LIIC path connecting both the S2 minimum and the S2/S1/T2 intersection
structure. There is a barrier of 0.44 eV, which is 0.09 eV higher
than the S2 energy at the Franck–Condon point. Nonetheless,
it should be stressed that the LIIC path is not a minimum-energy reaction
path, and the estimated barrier therefrom is a top limit. At this
three-state intersection, the internal conversion process to the S1 state takes place efficiently. The intersystem crossing process
to the T2(3nπ*) state
from the S2(1ππ*) state is also
enhanced by the large S2/T2 spin–orbit
coupling of 435 cm–1, which also complies with the
classical El-Sayed rule.

point, i.e., the
S0 minimum and the S2 minimum calculated at
the MS-CASPT2 level (in eV).

Figure 7 MS-CASPT2 calculated LIIC paths connecting (left) the S2 and S1 minima; (right) the S2 minimum and
the S2/S1/T2 three-state intersection
structure (in eV).

Once one of both S1 and T2 states are populated
through both internal conversion and intersystem crossing processes
via the above discussed S2/S1/T2 intersection
structure, these two excited states will become highly quasi-degenerate
with the T1 state in energy in an extended region. This
viewpoint can be seconded by our MS-CASPT2 calculated LIIC paths,
which separately connect the S1, T2, and T1 minima as shown in Figure 8. Therefore, there will exist two different relaxation
paths that finally populate the lowest triplet state, i.e., T1. In the first one, the S1(1nπ*) state that is from the S2 state via
the S2/S1/T2 intersection will further
hop to the T1(3ππ*) state through
the more efficient intersystem crossing process than that to the T2(3nπ*) state (still because
of the El-Sayed rule). The spin–orbit coupling is calculated
at the MS-CASPT2 level to be 437 cm–1 for S1/T1 and 39 cm–1 for S1/T2. In the second one, the T2(3nπ*) state that is also generated from the
S2/S1/T2 intersection will jump to
the T1 state through the fast internal conversion process.
In the third one, the S1(1nπ*) state is first decayed to the T2(3nπ*) state followed by the internal conversion
to the T1(3ππ*) state, which should
not be as efficient as the former two, however, because the intersystem
crossing process from S1(1nπ*) to T2(3nπ*)
is not favorable due to the classical El-Sayed rule.

Figure 8 MS-CASPT2 calculated
LIIC paths connecting (top) the S1 and T2 minima;
(bottom-left) the S1 and T1 minima; (bottom-right)
the T2 and T1 minima (in eV).

Finally, the T1 decay channel to the
S0 state
is also explored at the MS-CASPT2 level. Figure 9 depicts the calculated LIIC path connecting
both the T1 minimum and the T2/T1/S0 intersection structure. It can be found that the latter
demands a large energy change of more than 0.87 eV relative to the
T1 minimum although there is a large T1/S0 spin–orbit coupling at the three-state T2/T1/S0 intersection structure (508 cm–1). Hence, the S0 state’s repopulation from the
lowest T1 state via T2/T1/S0 should be unimportant. In comparison, the T1 state can
more efficiently decay to the S0 state via the two-state
T1/S0 intersection structure because this process
only demands 0.11 eV in terms of the flat T1 potential
energy surface as demonstrated by the LIIC path connecting the T1 minimum and the T1/S0 intersection
structure. This radiationless process to the ground state is also
accelerated by the large T1/S0 spin–orbit
coupling at the two-state T1/S0 intersection
structure (252 cm–1 at the MS-CASPT2 level). This
is also consistent with recently observed 835-fold enhancement of
the T1 decay of 6SeGua compared with that of 6tGua in experiments.

calculated LIIC paths connecting (left) the T1 minimum
and the two-state T1/S0 intersection
structure; (right) the T1 minimum and the three-state T2/T1/S0 intersection structure (in eV).

Correlation with Previous
Works
Figure 10 shows our suggested photophysical mechanism
of 6SeGua when its S2(1ππ*) state
is populated in the Franck–Condon region. This initial excited
singlet state, after the FC relaxation, will decay to either S1(1nπ*) or T2(3nπ*) states via the three-state intersection
point S2/S1/T2. Both the internal
conversion from the S2(1ππ*) to
S1(1nπ*) state and the
intersystem crossing from the S2(1ππ*)
to T2(3nπ*) state should
be efficient. The latter is also enhanced by its large S2/T2 spin–orbit coupling according to the classical
El-Sayed rule (435 cm–1 at the MS-CASPT2 level).
The resultant S1(1nπ*)
state can further hop to either the T2(3nπ*) state or the T1(3ππ*)
state via the second intersystem crossing process. In spite of the
fact that the S1(1nπ*)
→ T1(3ππ*) intersystem crossing
is more efficient than the S1(1nπ*) → T2(3nπ*)
one due to the El-Sayed rule, the latter cannot be excluded due to
its comparably large S1/T2 spin–orbit
coupling of 39 cm–1, which still cannot compete
with the latter, however (S1/T1: 437 cm–1). The T2 state that is populated from
either the initial S2(1ππ*) state
or the intermediate S1(1nπ*)
state will further hop to the T1 state through the subsequent
internal conversion process, which should be very fast concerning
that both states are nearly quasi-degenerate in an extended region
of involved potential energy surfaces. Finally, the generated T1 state can also decay to the ground state via the energetically
allowed two-state T1/S0 intersection point,
which is merely 0.11 eV higher than the T1 minimum. This
process is also expedited by the large spin–orbit coupling
(see above).

Figure 10 Suggested photophysical mechanism for 6SeGua based on
our present
MS-CASPT2 calculations.

Our suggested excited-state relaxation paths are qualitatively
similar to that reported by Pirillo et al. predicted by the TD-DFT
method.48 The S2(1ππ*) → S1(1nπ*) → T1(3ππ*) path
should be the most favorable one, followed by the S2(1ππ*) → S1(1nπ*) → T2(3nπ*) → T1(3ππ*) path,
as shown in Figure 10. However, our present work provides more accurate excited-state
structures and energies because the TD-DFT method overestimates all
adiabatic excitation energies for the involved S2(1ππ*), S1(1nπ*), T2(3nπ*),
and T1(3ππ*) states, as discussed
above (more than 0.43 eV for S1). This situation is also
seen for the vertical excitation energies (see above, 2.61 eV at MS-CASPT2
vs 3.10 eV at TD-B3LYP to the S1(1nπ*) state). Moreover, the MS-CASPT2 optimization also gives
a little different geometric parameter, for example, 1.944 Å
at MS-CASPT2 vs 1.851 Å at TD-B3LYP for the C2–Se1 bond
length of the T1(3ππ*) minimum.
Finally, it should be stressed that previous works merely determined
the stationary points in the ground- and excited-states but did not
explore the accessibilities of these stationary points from the initially
populated singlet state. In addition, intersection structures responsible
for the radiationless transition between different potential energy
surfaces were also not studied. In the present work, the accessibilities
of the excited-state minima are all explored using the MS-CASPT2 calculated
LIIC paths and the related three- and two-state intersection structures
and their roles in the excited-state relaxation are scrutinized as
well at the same computational level.

Experimentally, it is
suggested that the 835-fold acceleration
of the T1 decay to the S0 state in 6SeGua compared
with that in 6tGua, 1.7 vs 1420 ns, is ascribed to a stronger spin–orbit
coupling and a smaller energy barrier to the T1/S0 intersection region. In terms of the present and previous calculations,
one can find that the energy barriers to the related T1/S0 intersection points are more or less close to each
other, 0.11 eV in 6SeGua vs 0.16 eV in 6tGua.34 Therefore, we infer that the large difference of the T1 decay rates should primarily stem from the significantly increased
T1/S0 spin–orbit coupling of 6SeGua relative
to that of 6tGua.

Finally, we have found that the ground-state
electronic structure
of 6SeGua has a much obvious multireference character. MS-CASPT2 electronic
structure analysis shows that the weight of the closed-shell electronic
configuration, i.e., 2222220000 is only 0.77; in contrast, there is
a comparable open-shell electronic configuration, i.e., 22222ud000
with 0.11 weight. This multireference ground-state property could
make the C7–C11 bond length of 6SeGua much longer than those
of natural Gua and 6tGua (1.410 Å vs 1.369 Å vs 1.367 Å).
This peculiar electronic structure could be employed in certain applications.

Conclusions
We have employed the highly accurate MS-CASPT2
method to study
the photophysical mechanism of 6-selenium-substituted guanine (6SeGua).
The MS-CASPT2 calculated vertical excitation energies are consistent
with experimentally measured adsorption peaks very well and show that
the S2(1ππ*) singlet state is first
populated in the Franck–Condon region. In comparison with the
TD-DFT method, the MS-CASPT2 method provides more accurate structures
and energies. In terms of our MS-CASPT2-optimized stationary and intersection
points and computed LIIC paths, there exists two possible excited-state
relaxation paths from the electronically excited S2(1ππ*) singlet state and they are the S2(1ππ*) → S1(1nπ*) → T1(3ππ*)
and S2(1ππ*) → S1(1nπ*) → T2(3nπ*) → T1(3ππ*) paths, respectively. In addition, we suggest that
the large difference of the T1 decay rates to the S0 state, 1.7 ns for 6SeGua vs 1420 ns for 6tGua in experiments,
should primarily stem from the significantly increased T1/S0 spin–orbit coupling of 6SeGua in that the energy
barriers to the related T1/S0 intersection points
are more or less close to each other, 0.11 eV in 6SeGua vs 0.16 eV
in 6tGua. Finally, we have found that the electronic structure of
6SeGua in the S0 state is of much obvious multireference
character with significant contribution from the open-shell electronic
configuration, which rationalizes its much longer C7–C11 bond
length compared with those of natural Gua and 6tGua. This intriguing
finding could be employed in certain applications. The present computational
work also enriches our knowledge of the photophysics of seleno-substituted
nucleobases and could motivate the following experimental studies
on other nucleobase variants.

Computational Methods
Minima and
intersection structural optimization are carried out
directly using the multistate complete active space second-order perturbation
approach (MS-CASPT2).49,50 Three and five roots are used
in the MS-CASPT2 optimizations and single point energy refinements
in which equal roots are used. All MS-CASPT2 calculations use an active
space of 12 electrons in 10 orbitals, which includes 7 π and
π* orbitals, 2 σ and σ* orbitals, and 1 n orbital of the selenium atom. The ionization potential-electron
affinity (IPEA) is set to zero51 because
our tests show that such setting gives better agreement with experiments
for the vertical excitation energy of the S2 state (3.39
vs exp. 3.47 eV). This has been noticed by González and co-workers
in their recent work.52 An imaginary shift
value of 0.2 is employed to avoid the intruder-state issue;53 the Cholesky decomposition approach with on-the-fly
unbiased auxiliary basis sets is used to deal with two-electron integrals.54 The cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets are used
for geometry optimizations and energy refinements on the C, N, and
H atoms; whereas for selenium atom, aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis
sets are employed for geometry optimizations and single point calculations,
respectively.55 Spin–orbit coupling
calculations use the same basis sets as single point refinements,
in which the atomic mean-field approximation is adopted.56−58 The effective spin–orbit couplings reported in this work
are expressed  in which ΨI and ΨJ are electronic wavefunctions
of involved singlet and triplet states; Hxso, Hyso, and Hzso are spin–orbit operators of x, y, and z components. All of the computations are
performed using MOLCAS8.0.59,60
