Careful design of the structures
of interfaces between nanofillers
and polymer matrices can significantly improve the mechanical and
thermal properties of the overall nanocomposites. Here, we investigate
how the grafting density on the surface of nanocelluloses influences
the properties of nanocellulose/cellulose triacetate (CTA) composites.
The surface of nanocellulose, which was prepared by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
oxidation, was modified with long poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains
at different grafting densities. The PEG-grafted nanocelluloses were
homogeneously embedded in CTA matrices. The mechanical and thermal
properties of the nanocomposites were characterized. Increasing the
grafting density caused the soft PEG chains to form denser and thicker
layers around the rigid nanocelluloses. The PEG layers were not completely
miscible with the CTA matrix. This structure considerably enhanced
the energy dissipation by allowing sliding at the interface, which
increased the toughness of the nanocomposites. The thermal and mechanical
properties of the composites could be tailored by controlling the
grafting density. These findings provide a deeper understanding about
interfacial design for nanocellulose-based composite materials.

Introduction
In polymer composite
materials, interfacial properties between
the soft polymer matrix and rigid fillers are an important factor
governing their mechanical properties.1−5 Under strain, load transfer occurs at the interfaces. Well-designed
interfaces can therefore improve the strength, stiffness, and toughness
of composite materials. This design becomes more important in the
case of “nanofiller”-reinforced polymer composites,
because the interfacial layer occupies a large volume fraction in
the composite, due to the large specific surface area of the nanofillers.
Controlling the chemical and morphological features at the interface
is of great importance in nanocomposites.

Surface modification
of nanofillers is usually carried out to control
the properties of the interface. The surface energy, balance between
hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and dispersibility of nanofillers
have all been modified to achieve good compatibility at the interface.6−8 Polymer grafting is one of the most effective methods.6,7,9−11 This approach
allows the surface chemistry of the fillers and thickness of the grafted
layer to be controlled, by varying the molecular weight (Mw) and grafting density of the grafted polymer. Polymer-grafted
nanofillers can form versatile interfacial structures with polymer
matrices.

In our previous study, we modified the surface of
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNs) with an amine-terminated
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2) at the same grafting density.
The reinforcing properties of the PEG-grafted TOCNs (PEG-TOCNs) were
investigated using cellulose triacetate (CTA) as a polymer matrix.
The addition of PEG-TOCN to the CTA matrix resulted in increases in
not only the modulus and tensile strength but also the ductility and
toughness,12 which is unusual for other
TOCN/polymer composites. Subsequently, we prepared PEG-TOCNs using
PEG-NH2 samples with different Mw values on TOCN at the same grafting density.13 The properties of the PEG-TOCN/CTA composite films were
studied to obtain the effect of chain lengths of the grafted PEG molecules
on the interfacial interactions in the CTA matrix.13 These results showed that the thermal and mechanical properties
of the PEG-TOCN/CTA composite films could be tuned by the interfacial
layer thickness formed by the grafted PEGs and CTA. However, there
was no information about the effect of the grafting density of PEG
chains on TOCN surfaces on the properties of PEG-TOCN/CTA composite
films, despite the PEG density directly affecting the chain conformation
on the TOCN surfaces.

Herein, the contribution of the grafting
density to the mechanical,
thermal, and dynamic mechanical thermal properties of nanocellulose-reinforced
polymer composites was investigated. PEG chains having the same Mw were grafted onto TOCN surfaces at different
grafting densities via ionic bonds (see Figure 1). The PEG-TOCN/CTA composite films were
prepared by solvent casting using N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). The relationship between the grafting
density and thermal and mechanical properties of the composite films
is discussed.

dispersions.

Results and Discussion
The protonated TOCN (TOCN-COOH) and a series of PEG-TOCNs containing
different grafting ratios (27, 44, 60, and 72% mol/mol to the surface
COOH groups) were prepared (see Figure S1 and Table S1). These TOCNs were abbreviated
to P0-T, P27-T, P44-T, P60-T, and P72-T, respectively, with the numeral
indicating the grafting ratio. The structures of the TOCNs and digital
photographs of the TOCNs/DMAc dispersions are shown in Figure 1. The TOCN-COOH and PEG-TOCN
elements were individually dispersed in DMAc without aggregation,
regardless of the grafting density. TOCN-COOH disperses in DMAc due
to the osmotic pressure between the electric double layers on the
TOCN surface.13 The PEG-TOCNs disperse
due to the osmotic pressure between the grafted PEG layers.14−16 According to the calculation for polymer conformation in a good
solvent,17−19 the grafted PEG chains had a polymer brush conformation
in the vicinity of the TOCN surface, irrespective of the grafting
density (see Supporting Information). From
these homogeneous dispersions, TOCN/CTA nanocomposite films with different
PEG grafting densities were prepared by the solvent casting method.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Observations
Figure 2 shows TEM
images of cross-sections of the nanocomposite films. TOCN elements
were well dispersed in the CTA matrix with and without PEG grafting.
Thin fibrillar elements with clear grain boundaries were observed
in the TEM image of the P0-T/CTA composite film. Thick PEG-TOCN elements
with indistinct boundaries were observed in the TEM image of the P72-T/CTA
composite film. It was likely that both TOCNs and grafted PEG layers
were stained and thus observed as indistinct elements in the P72-T/CTA
composite film. These results show that the nanocomposites with different
grafting densities had similar homogeneous distributions of TOCNs
in the CTA matrix. This suggests that PEG grafting did not affect
the dispersibility of the TOCNs. Therefore, changes in the other properties
observed in the present study can be related solely to the interfacial
PEG density.

films.

Mechanical Properties
Figure 3 shows representative
stress–strain
curves of the TOCN/CTA nanocomposites. The nanocomposites exhibited
improved mechanical properties compared with neat CTA, with the properties
depending on the surface grafting density of the TOCNs (Figure 4 and Table 1). The density of the nanocomposite and crystallinity
of the CTA matrix were almost the same (approximately 1.15 and 25–30%,
respectively), irrespective of the grafting density (Table S2 in Supporting Information). The different nanocomposites
had identical TOCN compositions (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Therefore, the differences in mechanical
properties of the nanocomposites were attributed to the different
grafting densities on the TOCN surfaces.

Figure 4a shows
the Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites. The modulus increased
upon the addition of P0-T (Figure 4a). Increasing the grafting density of TOCNs caused
the nanocomposites to become softer, which was most likely due to
sliding at the PEG/CTA interfaces. In general, soft interfacial layers
surrounding rigid fillers have a low capability to transfer stress
between the filler and the polymer matrix.20−23 Thus, the soft PEG layer in this
study increased the sliding at the TOCN/CTA interface, resulting in
the lower stiffness with increasing grafting density. The TOCN content
in the present study was also sufficiently high to form a percolation
network.24 The rigid percolation network
of nanocellulose25,26 may have been loosened by PEG
grafting, which could have influenced the changes in Young’s
modulus. The PEG-TOCN/CTA composites showed lower Young’s modulus
values than the P0-T/CTA composite. However, the modulus was still
as high as that of neat CTA with the addition of P72-T. The ultimate
strength of the PEG-TOCN/CTA composites showed a trend similar to
that of Young’s modulus (Figure 4b). This was most likely due to changes in stress-transfer
behavior by the surface PEG layers as discussed above.

The elongation
at break and toughness significantly increased with
increasing grafting density (Figure 4c,d). The toughness, which was calculated from the
area under the stress–strain curve, significantly increased
with increasing grafting density. As previously reported, soft interlayers
between fillers and polymer matrices support the plastic deformation
of the polymer matrices, and enhance energy dissipation during deformation.27−31 Therefore, the dense and soft PEG layers of the nanocomposites enhanced
the deformation and energy dissipation of the nanocomposites after
the yielding point. Accordingly, PEG grafting resulted in the toughness
of CTA increasing by up to 4 times. Nanocellulose/polymer nanocomposites
generally exhibit a stiff yet brittle behavior, as was the case for
the current P0-T/CTA composite. In contrast, the PEG-TOCN/CTA composites
exhibited an unusual reinforcing effect, which greatly improved the
toughness without sacrificing the stiffness of the CTA matrix. This
toughening effect was not significantly caused by the plasticizing
effect of the PEG chains, which is discussed in the next section.

Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis
Storage modulus
(E′) and loss tangent (tan δ;
loss modulus/storage modulus) curves of the nanocomposites are shown
in Figure 5, and characteristic
values calculated from the data are given in Table 2. The E′ of the nanocomposites
was 2.6–3.3 GPa at 23 °C, and showed a trend similar to
that of Young’s modulus in the tensile tests (Figure 4a). At −80 °C (<grass
transition temperature of PEG32), the difference
in the E′ values of the nanocomposites was
less significant because the grafted PEG chains were in the solid
state.

The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the nanocomposites were calculated from the position of the
α-transition peak in the tan δ curves (Figure 5b). The Tg of the CTA matrix slightly increased upon adding TOCN
and PEG-TOCNs (Table 2). The Tg of polymer matrices can reportedly
be increased by adding nanofillers that have good interactions with
the polymer matrix or that form a percolated network that confines
the molecular mobility of the polymer matrix.4,33−36 In the present study, TOCNs or PEG-TOCNs likely formed a network
and confined the chain mobility of the CTA matrix. When only PEG-NH2 was incorporated, the Tg of the
CTA matrix decreased due to the plasticizing effect (Figure S2 and Table S5 in Supporting
Information). This suggested that PEG and CTA were not completely
miscible in the nanocomposite system, possibly due to crowding of
the dense grafted PEG chains.

Thermomechanical Properties
Figure 6 shows coefficient
of thermal expansion (CTE)
values for the nanocomposites. The CTE of the P0-T/CTA composites
was 13% lower than that of neat CTA. This was because P0-T formed
a rigid and thermally stable percolating network, and restrained the
thermal expansion of the CTA matrix. The CTE of the PEG-TOCN/CTA nanocomposites
increased with increasing grafting density. This was because the PEG
layers surrounded the TOCN surfaces and loosened the TOCN network.
The CTE values of the PEG-NH2/CTA films were higher than
that of neat CTA because of the increased free volume caused by the
PEG chains (see Figure S3 in Supporting
Information). The present PEG-TOCN/CTA nanocomposites showed almost
the same CTE values as that of neat CTA, until the grafting density
reached 60%. This resulted from both restraint by the TOCN network,
and the enhanced thermal expansion caused by the PEG chains.12

Conclusions
We systematically investigated the contribution
of the grafting
density to the properties of nanocellulose-reinforced polymer composites,
where TOCNs with different grafting densities were well dispersed
in CTA matrices. The present study is one of the case studies for
nanocellulose/polymer composites to understand the influence of interfacial
layers on the composite properties. In the nanocomposites, the surface
PEG layer and CTA matrix were not completely miscible, which caused
a reinforcing effect. Specifically, an increase in grafting density
caused the grafted PEG to form a denser layer around the TOCN surfaces.
This enhanced sliding between the PEG and CTA, which significantly
increased the toughness of the material. Importantly, the Young’s
modulus of CTA was not decreased by the addition of PEG-TOCNs. This
strategy allows the thermal and mechanical properties to be tuned
by simply changing the grafting density. These findings provide insights
into the interfacial design of CNF-based composite materials.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Never-dried softwood bleached kraft pulp
(SBKP) produced by Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd., Japan, was used
as wood cellulose. CTA was produced by Daicel Corp., Japan.12,13 PEG-NH2 (SUNBRIGHT MEPA-20H, Mw = 2182) was produced by NOF Corp., Japan. Uranyl acetate, lead citrate,
and ruthenium tetroxide were purchased from Mitsuwa Chemicals Co.,
Ltd., Japan, TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd., England, and Nacalai
Tesque, Inc., Japan, respectively. All other reagents and solvents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan, or Fuji Film Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Japan.

TEMPO/NaBr/NaClO Oxidation
TEMPO/NaBr/NaClO
oxidation
was performed according to a previous study.12,13,37 TEMPO and NaBr (0.016 and 0.1 g, respectively)
were added to distilled water (100 mL), and this mixture was stirred
until a homogeneous TEMPO/NaBr/water solution was obtained. SBKP (1.0
g) was added to the solution, and the SBKP/TEMPO/NaBr slurry was stirred
with a magnetic stir bar for 30 min. Then, 2 M sodium hypochlorite
(NaClO, 10 mmol/g-SBKP, 5 mL) was added to the slurry to initiate
oxidation. The oxidation continued in the slurry at pH 10 and room
temperature for 6 h. A pH stat (AUT-501, DKK-TOA Corp., Japan) was
used to maintain the pH 10 during oxidation. After oxidation, ethanol
was added to the slurry to consume excess NaClO and to finish the
oxidation. The TEMPO-oxidized pulp (TOP) was washed with deionized
water until pH 7 by filtration using a glass filter. The TOP (1.0
g) was postoxidized with sodium chlorite (NaClO2, 1.1 g)
in a 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.8, 100 mL) at room temperature for
48 h. After the NaClO2 oxidation, the TOP was washed with
deionized water until pH 7 by filtration using a glass filter. The
TOP was freeze-dried to determine the carboxylate content by conductometric
titration. The carboxylate content of the TOP was 1.78 mmol/g.

Preparation
of TOCN-COOH/DMAc and PEG-TOCN/DMAc Dispersion
The TOCN-COOH
gel particle was prepared according to a previous
method.38 The TOCN-COOH gel was suspended
in DMAc (0.1% w/v). Then, PEG-NH2 was dissolved in DMAc
and added to the TOCN-COOH/DMAc suspension to ionically graft PEG-NH2 chains on the TOCN surfaces.13 The suspension was mechanically agitated for 24 h with a Rotamax
120.13 The amount of PEG-NH2 added was controlled to prepare PEG-TOCNs with different grafting
densities. The PEG-TOCN/DMAc and TOCN-COOH gel/DMAc suspensions were
sonicated and centrifuged to prepare PEG-TOCN/DMAc and TOCN-COOH/DMAc
dispersions, respectively, according to the previous study.13

Preparation of TOCN-COOH/CTA and PEG-TOCN/CTA
Composite Films
A 2% w/v CTA/DMAc solution and either TOCN-COOH/DMAc
or PEG-TOCN/DMAc
dispersion were mixed, and this mixture was stirred for 30 min. The
mixture was then cast-dried in vacuo at 40 °C for 1 day and subsequently
at 70 °C for 1 week. The TOCN content in the nanocomposites was
calculated according to the following equation and adjusted to 2.5%
w/w  The PEG-NH2/CTA films were prepared
as a reference using the same procedure. The amount of PEG-NH2 in the composites was adjusted to be identical to that in
the corresponding PEG-TOCN/CTA composites.

Analyses
Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra
of cast-dried TOCN-COOH or PEG-TOCN films were measured with a spectrometer
(JASCO FT/IR-6100, transmission mode from 400 to 4000 cm–1, 4 cm–1 resolution). The grafting ratios of the
PEG chains onto the surface COOH groups were calculated from the intensity
of the absorption peak at 1720 cm–1.12,13 TEM observations were conducted using a Hitachi HT 7700 Exalens
TEM apparatus, at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. For TEM observations,
the nanocomposites were embedded in epoxy resin, which was then sectioned
in the direction parallel to the film surface using a diamond knife.
The 80 nm-thick sections were stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 2%
lead citrate or with ruthenium tetroxide on a collodion film to provide
clear contrast between the stained TOCN elements and CTA matrix. Tensile
tests were performed according to our previous study.13 Twenty specimens were tested for each sample. Dynamic mechanical
thermal analysis (DMTA) was performed using a dynamic mechanical analyzer
(DMA Q800, TA instruments, Inc., DE) at temperatures from −100
to 200 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min and a frequency
of 1 Hz. The specimens for DMTA were rectangular shaped (40 mm ×
5 mm). Three specimens were tested for each sample. Thermal analysis
was performed using the same procedure used in the previous study.13
