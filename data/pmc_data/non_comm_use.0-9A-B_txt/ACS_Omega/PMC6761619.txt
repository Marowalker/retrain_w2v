Inorganic
pyrophosphatase containing regulatory cystathionine β-synthase
(CBS) domains (CBS-PPase) is inhibited by adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) and adenosine diphosphate and activated by adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and diadenosine polyphosphates; mononucleotide binding to CBS
domains and substrate binding to catalytic domains are characterized
by positive cooperativity. This behavior implies three pathways for
regulatory signal transduction — between regulatory and active
sites, between two active sites, and between two regulatory sites.
Bioinformatics analysis pinpointed six charged or polar amino acid
residues of Desulfitobacterium hafniense CBS-PPase as potentially important for enzyme regulation. Twelve
mutant enzyme forms were produced, and their kinetics of pyrophosphate
hydrolysis was measured in wide concentration ranges of the substrate
and various adenine nucleotides. The parameters derived from this
analysis included catalytic activity, Michaelis constants for two
active sites, AMP-, ATP-, and diadenosine tetraphosphate-binding constants
for two regulatory sites, and the degree of activation/inhibition
for each nucleotide. Replacements of arginine 295 and asparagine 312
by alanine converted ATP from an activator to an inhibitor and markedly
affected practically all the above parameters, indicating involvement
of these residues in all the three regulatory signaling pathways.
Replacements of asparagine 312 and arginine 334 abolished or reversed
kinetic cooperativity in the absence of nucleotides but conferred
it in the presence of diadenosine tetraphosphate, without effects
on nucleotide-binding parameters. Modeling and molecular dynamics
simulations revealed destabilization of the subunit interface as a
result of asparagine 312 and arginine 334 replacements by alanine,
explaining abolishment of kinetic cooperativity. These findings identify
residues 295, 312, and 334 as crucial for CBS-PPase regulation via
CBS domains.

==== Body
Introduction
Regulatory CBS domains
are found in many important enzymes, membrane
transporters, and other proteins in all kingdoms of life and in most
cases bind adenine nucleotides as regulatory ligands.1,2 The human genome encodes 75 CBS domain-containing proteins, and
mutations in some of them are associated with hereditary diseases.3,4 However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of CBS
domain-mediated regulation, mainly because of difficulty in obtaining
structural data for full-size proteins. In this regard, prokaryotic
CBS domain-containing pyrophosphatase (CBS-PPase) may be a good model
to study this phenomenon because it is easily accessible and stable,
binds an array of adenine nucleotides, including diadenosine polyphosphates,
and has a relatively simple structure; its activity can be conveniently
and precisely measured. An additional merit of CBS-PPase is that its
regulation through CBS domains is not complicated by other regulatory
mechanisms, such as autophosphorylation in AMP-activated protein kinase5 and dithiol reduction/oxidation in cystathionine
β-synthase.6

CBS-PPases belong
to family II PPases—homodimeric Co or
Mn metalloenzymes7,8 with the most complex domain organization
among different PPases. Each subunit of canonical family II PPase
is formed by two catalytic domains, DHH and DHHA2,9,10 which
are supplemented by regulatory domains in CBS-PPases.8 An ∼250-residue regulatory insert, found within
the DHH domain, generally consists of a pair of cystathionine β-synthase
(CBS) domains (a Bateman module11) intercalated
by a DRTGG domain. The crystal structure of the isolated regulatory
insert indicates that four CBS domains belonging to two Bateman modules
form a disk-like structure at the subunit interface.12 By binding to the Bateman module, AMP and ADP inhibit CBS-PPase,
whereas ATP and linear diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnA,
with n ≥ 4) activate it.13,14 In accordance with the opposite effects of AMP and Ap4A on CBS-PPase activity, their complexes with the regulatory insert
show significant differences in the 3D structure.12 The pathways through which these structural changes propagate
from the regulatory domains to the catalytic site in CBS-PPase still
remain to be determined.

CBS-PPase regulation additionally involves
a communication between
the catalytic sites and the regulatory sites, as indicated by positive
cooperativity of substrate hydrolysis (kinetic cooperativity) and
monoadenosine-phosphate binding.15 Accordingly,
two different Michaelis and nucleotide-binding constants are required
to describe the hydrolysis kinetics and its modulation by monoadenosine
phosphates, respectively. Ap4A is unique as a regulator
of CBS-PPase because it bridges two Bateman modules in the enzyme
dimer12 and, hence, binds noncooperatively.
A less predictable effect of Ap4A is that it abolishes
kinetic cooperativity,14 which can be explained
in two principally different ways: the dinucleotide either blocks
communication between the catalytic sites and allows them to function
independently or “silences” one active site (ultimate
kinetic cooperativity). Interestingly, CBS-PPase is the only known
CBS-protein regulated by diadenosine polyphosphates, acting as cellular
alarmones.16

Recent studies have
identified two residues (Asn312 and Arg276)
that are located in the DHH and CBS domains, respectively, and have
a prominent role in CBS-PPase regulation and catalysis.17,18 Asparagine substitution by a serine residue dramatically affects
regulation by abolishing kinetic cooperativity in the absence of adenine
nucleotides but restoring it in the presence of Ap4A.17 The arginine located in the CBS2 domain has
been found to control kinetic cooperativity, nucleotide-binding affinity,
and the size of the regulatory signal exerted by both mono- and dinucleotides.18 However, transmission of the regulatory signal
from the CBS domains to a distantly located catalytic site and between
subunits in CBS-PPase should involve an extended residue network that
links all catalytic and regulatory sites in CBS-PPase. To identify
other members of the network, we performed an extensive mutagenesis
study of the subunit interface-forming CBS and DHH domains. The results
reported below confirmed the proposed role of Asn312 and identified
two arginine residues, Arg295 and Arg334, with a prominent role in
activity regulation.

Results
Selection of Residues for
Substitution
Polar residues
potentially important for signal transduction between the regulatory
and active sites in dhPPase were selected based on
two criteria: location in the contact regions of secondary structure
elements and a high degree of conservation in CBS-PPases. The tertiary
structures of the catalytic and regulatory parts of dhPPase were obtained by homology modeling using canonical Bacillus subtilis PPase10 in the “open” conformation and the regulatory part
of cpPPase12 with bound
AMP as the templates, respectively. The two parts were thereafter
combined into a full-size structure (Figure 1), as described previously for cpPPase.12 Regulatory ligand-binding residues
in CBS domains generally belong to β-strands, whereas α-helices
transmit the ligand-induced conformational change to catalytic domains.1,2 The structural analysis suggested that helix α1 (residues
266–275) is the best candidate for signal transmission to the
catalytic DHH domain. This helix interacts with the loops formed by
residues 310–323 and 334–341; the former loop contains
Asn312, earlier shown to be important for catalysis and kinetic cooperativity.17 Next to the other side of helix α1 is
Arg276, also important for allosteric regulation.18

Figure 1 Predicted three-dimensional structure of dhPPase
dimer. The structure was obtained by homology modeling using the structures
of canonical B. subtilis PPase (DHH
and DHHA2 domains, PDB ID: 1 K23) and the regulatory part of cpPPase (CBS1, CBS2, and DRTGG domains, PDB ID: 3 L31) as
the templates. The domains are shown in different colors in one subunit;
the other subunit is gray. AMP molecules bound in the regulatory parts
are depicted in green, and two Mn2+ ions bound in both
active sites are shown as violet spheres. (A) The model of the whole

(R276) are shown in a spherical representation in the subunit colored
gray. (B) A close-up view of the central part of the molecule in panel
(A), with side chains of the selected residues shown as sticks.

Sequence comparison of 188 CBS-PPase sequences
retrieved by a BLAST
search of the NCBI Protein and KEGG GENES databases indicated high
conservation in the regions suggested by the 3D model to be important
for signal transduction between the CBS2 and DHH domains (Figure S1). Of note, the overall degree of conservation
was smaller for the regulatory domain in comparison with the catalytic
one (27 vs 49%8). Based on the two criteria,
six residues were selected for mutagenesis: CBS2 domain Ser266, Glu267,
Lys269, and Arg295 and DHH domain Asn312 and Arg334 (Figure 1B). Residues 266, 267, and
269 belong to helix α1, and residue 295 belongs to helix α2
of the CBS2 domain. Asn312 of the DHH domain was earlier found to
be involved in kinetic cooperativity (active site interaction),17 and Arg334 immediately follows the invariant
DHH motif (which gave name to the domain), containing two His residues
directly involved in catalysis.19 In some
CBS-PPases, Arg334 is conservatively replaced by lysine. None of the
selected residues forms contacts with the bound nucleotide in the
regulatory site and substrate or metal ions in the active site.

All selected residues were replaced by alanine, and four residues
were additionally subjected to more drastic (Ser/Asp, Lys/Glu, Arg/Glu)
or less drastic (Lys/Arg, Arg/Lys) substitutions (Table 1). Arg295 was additionally replaced
by Leu, frequently found in this position in naturally occurring CBS-PPases.

Production and Structural
Characterization of dhPPase Variants
Wild-type dhPPase and its
variants were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells using the pET expression system. The recombinant
proteins gave separate intense bands on SDS-PAGE analysis of cell
extracts, indicating successful expression. The variant dhPPases were isolated from the extracts by metal affinity chromatography
followed by gel filtration. As in previous isolations, the elution
profile at the final purification step demonstrated two major peaks,
both containing the target variant, which was in an aggregated form
in the first peak. Accordingly, only the second peak was collected
and used in the studies described below. Typical protein yields were
approximately 10 mg/1 L cell culture, and the proteins were >95%
pure.

To estimate the effects of the substitutions on the overall
structure
of dhPPase, thermal stability of all alanine variants
was measured using the SYPRO Orange dye as a probe for protein unfolding.20 Five of the six variants exhibited the values
of the “melting” temperature, which were derived from
the fluorescence versus temperature curves (Figure S2A), similar to or greater than that for the wild-type enzyme
(57 ± 1 °C) (Table S1). One variant
(K269A) demonstrated a slightly lower melting temperature (54 ±
1 °C).

Sedimentation velocity measurements of the six alanine
variants
indicated no significant changes in the s20,w value (Table S2) and, hence, the oligomeric
structure. The fraction of the aggregated forms with masses exceeding
that for the dimer was the highest in the E267A variant (19%) and
did not exceed 10% in other cases.

General Characterization
of Adenine Nucleotide Effects on dhPPase Variants
AMP and ADP inhibit, whereas ATP
and diadenosine polyphosphates activate wild-type dhPPase.14,15 For the initial characterization of the
variant dhPPases, the effects of these modulators
on activity were screened at fixed concentrations that were saturating
for the wild-type enzyme and a fixed concentration of the substrate
(50 μM). All dhPPase variants retained the
ability to be inhibited by AMP and ADP, although the degree of inhibition
was smaller in many cases (Table 1). Most variants similarly retained their ability to
be activated by ATP and diadenosine polyphosphates, with few notable
exceptions. Most surprisingly, two Arg295 substitutions converted
both ATP and Ap5A from activators into inhibitors, and
the Asn312 substitution converted ATP into an inhibitor. Not less
surprisingly, the degree of activation by Ap4A increased
by two orders of magnitude upon the R295A and R295E substitutions.
Activation by Ap5A was similarly enhanced by the R295E
but not by the R295A substitution. A more detailed analysis of the
effects of three nucleotides (AMP, Ap4A, and ATP) measured
at varied nucleotide and substrate concentrations is described below.
The activity of the R334E variant was quite low, and it was not characterized
further.

Detailed Analysis of AMP, Ap4A, and ATP Effects at
a Fixed Substrate Concentration
In this section, we measured
the effects of the three nucleotides in wide ranges of their concentrations
and analyzed the results in terms of Scheme 1 and eq 1 with unequal KN values for two
binding sites in the enzyme dimer. We also characterized the degree
of binding cooperativity with the Hill coefficient, h, of the empirical eq 3. The values of the ratio KN1/KN2 and h exceed unity for positive
cooperativity and are less than unity for negative cooperativity;
the expected maximal value of h for dimeric CBS-PPase
is two, whereas the KN1/KN2 ratio may adopt any value. The advantage of the microscopic
binding constants over the Hill coefficient is that they allow for
a more quantitative description of the cooperativity phenomenon.21 The corresponding dose dependencies for the
alanine variants are presented in Figure 2, and the parameter values derived therefrom
with eq 1 are summarized
in Figure 3 (see also Tables S3–S5 for numerical data), along
with analogous data for other variants.

(A) AN/A0,
(B) (KN1KN2)1/2, and (C) KN1/KN2. The substituted and replacing residues are
indicated in a one-letter notation at the bottom of the figure. The
vertical axes are scaled logarithmically. Values measured in the presence
of various nucleotides are indicated by different colors detailed
at the top of the figure. Dashed horizontal lines mark the parameter
level corresponding to the lack of effect (in panel (A)) or noncooperative binding (in panel (C)).

Scheme 1 Kinetic Scheme Describing Adenine Nucleotide Effects on a Dimeric
Enzyme E2 with Two Regulatory Sites at a Constant Substrate
Concentration
N is the nucleotide, KN1 and KN2 are the
microscopic nucleotide-binding constants, and A0 and AN are the activities (v/[E]0) of the nucleotide-free
and nucleotide-bound subunits, respectively. E2 represents
the sum of substrate-free and substrate-bound enzyme forms.

All variants were inhibited by AMP (Figures 2A and 3A; see also Table S3), but the inhibition
index (AN/A0) was markedly
elevated in some of them compared to the wild-type enzyme, consistent
with the data in Table 1 measured at a nearly saturating concentration of AMP. Most variants
retained the positive AMP binding cooperativity (KN1/KN2 and h > 1) observed in the wild-type dhPPase.15 In two Arg295 replacements, cooperativity was
abolished (R295A) or nearly so (R295E). Several variants (S266D, K269E,
and N312A) demonstrated enhanced cooperativity, as indicated by the
Hill coefficient approaching its upper limit for a homodimeric enzyme.
The midpoint AMP concentration on the binding curve (√KN1KN2) was greatly
reduced in the R295A and R295L variants but elevated in the R295E
variant.

The effects of Ap4A on activity were characterized
in
a similar way. The limiting values of the activation index (AN/A0), obtained
by extrapolating activity measured at 50 μM substrate to an
infinite Ap4A concentration (Figure 3A; see also Table S4), did not differ significantly from the vN/v values found in Table 1, indicating that the 10 μM Ap4A concentration used in the latter case was saturating or
nearly so. Indeed, the KN values for all dhPPase forms lie in the submicromolar range. Ap4A activated all variant dhPPases (AN/A0 > 1), but five variants
(R295L, N312A, R334A, R295A, and R295E in particular) were activated
to a much greater extent in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. In
all cases, Ap4A binding appeared to be noncooperative;
small apparent deviations in Km1/Km2 and h from unity may be
associated with the tightness of binding, which required the use of
very low Ap4A concentrations, making the activity assay
less accurate.

ATP effects were analyzed for only three variants
that demonstrated
a reversal of the modulation from activation to inhibition in Table 1. The corresponding
dose dependences of the inhibition are shown in Figure 2C, and the results of their analysis are
summarized in Figure 3 (see also Table S5). Both Arg295 replacements
reversed the ATP-binding cooperativity from positive to negative and
slightly tightened ATP binding in terms of √KN1KN2. The N312A variant,
whose activity was most sensitive to ATP (Figure 3), retained the positive binding cooperativity
of the wild-type enzyme.

Effects of the Substitutions on Kinetic Cooperativity
in the
Absence and Presence of AMP, Ap4A, and ATP
Rate
dependences on substrate concentration for wild-type dhPPases and the majority of its variants demonstrated deviations from
the Michaelis–Menten equation, that is, “kinetic cooperativity”,
which could be adequately described in terms of Scheme 2 and eq 2 with unequal Km values for two
active sites in the enzyme dimer (Figure 4). The degree of the kinetic cooperativity
was similarly characterized by the ratio Km1/Km2 and the Hill coefficient, h (values of the latter parameter are found in Table S6).

Figure 4 Dependences of the activities of dhPPase variants
on substrate concentration measured at 5 mM free Mg2+.
The lines show the best fits of eq 2. The red dashed curve refers to wild-type dhPPase and is taken from ref (15).

Scheme 2 Kinetic Scheme for
the Reaction Catalyzed by a Homodimeric Enzyme
E2 with Two Active Sites at a Zero or Fixed Nucleotide
Concentration
S is the substrate, Km1 and Km2 are the
Michaelis constants, and kcat is the catalytic
constant for each active site.

Based on these
criteria, wild-type dhPPase exhibits
appreciable positive kinetic cooperativity (Km1/Km2 = 10, h = 1.29).15 The replacements of Ser266,
Glu267, Lys269, and Arg295 had only small effects on the cooperativity,
whereas the replacements of Asn312 and Arg334 abolished or markedly
decreased it (Figure 5A; see also Table S6). There was no obvious
correlation between the effects on cooperativity and individual Km values; however, Km2 was more frequently affected. The largest effect on the mean Km value (√Km1Km2) was observed with the R295A and
R295E variants. According to the effects on kcat, the variants can be divided into two groups, that is,
those with large effects (boldfaced in Table S6) and those with small or moderate effects. For two residues (Arg295
and Arg334), the effect on kcat strongly
depended on the replacing residue.

on various parameters
describing MgPPi hydrolysis by dhPPase
in the absence and presence of adenine nucleotides: (A) kcat, (B) (Km1Km2)1/2, and (C) Km1/Km2. The substituted and replacing residues
are indicated in a one-letter notation at the bottom of the figure.
The vertical axes are scaled logarithmically. Bars showing the values
that exceeded the ordinate range in panel (C) end with arrows. Values
measured in the presence of various nucleotides are indicated by different
colors detailed at the top of the figure. Dashed horizontal lines
mark the parameter level for nucleotide-free wild-type dhPPase (panels (A) and (B)) or for noncooperative kinetics (panel
(C)).

In the second set of experiments,
we evaluated the effect of fixed
concentrations of AMP, Ap4A, and ATP on the dependences
of activity on substrate concentration (Figure S3). This type of experiment with AMP could be performed only
with the variants showing reasonably high AMP-binding affinity and
a high AN/A0 ratio (Figure 3;
see also Table S3) because otherwise the
nucleotide-free enzyme, present at equilibrium with the nucleotide-bound
enzyme, would contribute significantly to the measured activity. ATP
effects were again analyzed for the three variants that demonstrated
a reversal of the modulation effect in Table 1.

The results of this analysis indicate
that AMP decreased the kcat value for
all variants (Figure 5A; see also Table S7), that is, it acted
as an inhibitor. The effects
of AMP on the midpoint substrate concentration on activity versus
the [MgPPi] profile (√Km1Km2) were not uniform (Figure 5B; see also Table S7): in most variants, AMP increased √Km1Km2, that is,
it also acted as an inhibitor, but in the R295A, R295E, and N312A
variants, AMP decreased √Km1Km2 several fold, that is, it acted as an activator.
It should be noted, however, that the activating effect of AMP on
the three latter variants only partially compensated for the much
larger effects on kcat, which made AMP
an inhibitor at any substrate concentration. Interestingly, AMP abolished
positive kinetic cooperativity in one variant (R295E) and changed
it to slightly or moderately negative in four variants (E267A, R295A,
N312A, and R334A) (Table S7).

The
effects of Ap4A on the substrate concentration dependences
of activity indicated that Ap4A increased the kcat value of all variants, except for S266A, by a factor
varying from 1.3 to 45 (Figure 5A and Table S8). The effects of
Ap4A on the √Km1Km2 values were also favorable for activity,
except for the R295A, R295L, and N312A variants, and varied from 7-
to 36-fold, that is, it also markedly exceeded the effect on the wild-type
enzyme (a 2.4-fold decrease in √Km1Km2). As a combined result of the effects
of Ap4A on kcat and √Km1Km2, the activities
of the R295A and wild-type enzymes measured with 50 μM substrate
in the presence of Ap4A were similar, although their activities
measured in the absence of Ap4A differed by a factor of
250 (Table 1).

A remarkable effect of Ap4A on the wild-type dhPPase was the abolishment of kinetic cooperativity.14 This property was retained in a half of the
variants, whereas the other half demonstrated positive kinetic cooperativity
(Figure 5C), the degree
of which generally exceeded that demonstrated by the wild-type enzyme
in the absence of any nucleotide. For two Arg295 replacements, the
Hill coefficient even reached its limiting value for a dimeric enzyme
(Table S8).

ATP reversed kinetic
cooperativity only in the R295A variant, while
two other tested variants (R295L and N312A) retained the positive
cooperativity of the wild-type enzyme (Figure 5C; see also Table S9). ATP activation of the wild-type enzyme resulted from favorable
changes in both kcat (an increase) and
√Km1Km2 (a decrease). In the R295L variant, the ATP effects on both parameters
were unfavorable for activity, whereas in the two other variants,
ATP induced an unfavorable change in one parameter and a favorable
change in the other. Of note, the R295A variant was inhibited by ATP
at any substrate concentration because the unfavorable effect on kcat exceeded that of the favorable effect on
√Km1Km2, whereas the N312A variant was slightly activated in saturating
conditions but inhibited at low substrate concentrations (compare
the N312A curves in Figure 4 and Figure S3C).

Modeling and
MD Simulations
We have previously modeled
a three-dimensional structure of an N77S variant of canonical family
II PPase from B. subtilis(17) to understand why a corresponding mutation (N312S)
abolished active site interaction (kinetic cooperativity) in dhPPase. The modeled structure contained a bound substrate
analogue, imidodiphosphate, in only one subunit to mimic the state
at which substrate binding cooperativity is manifested. Here, we performed
the same modeling for the N77A variant of B. subtilis PPase. The modeled structure (Figure 6B) indicated an even more drastic change in the H-bonding
pattern of the loop formed by residues 96–109 at the subunit
interface. The replacement predictably caused loss of all intrasubunit
bonds of the residue 77 side chain. As a consequence, only three intersubunit
H-bonds were detected with the program Hbonanza22 using default settings in the N77A variant—between
Arg99 and Thr105′ (Nε2···O), between Asn102
and Phe103′ (N···O), and between Thr105 and
Ile100′ (Oγ···N) (Figure 6B) compared with eight such H-bonds present
in the wild-type enzyme (Figure 6A).

Modeling was also performed for the B. subtilis PPase R99A variant, which corresponds to the R334A variant of dhPPase used in this study. Unlike Asn77, Arg99 interacts
directly with the other subunit. Again, only three intersubunit H-bonds
were detected (Figure 6C), but they differed from those in the N77A variant. These H-bonds
included those between Ile100 and Thr105′ (N···Oγ
and O···N) and between Phe103 and Ile100′ (N···O).
Interestingly, Asn77 lost most of its intrasubunit H-bonds as a result
of the R99A substitution, resembling the effects of the N77A substitution.
Thus, these two mutations similarly destabilized the contact region
of the DHH domains in B. subtilis PPase.

Both simulated structures slightly differed from the crystal structure
of the wild-type enzyme (Figure S4). However,
the differences were of the same size as observed previously for wild-type bsPPase17 and seemingly result
from structural distortions of the crystalline state.

Discussion
The regulatory and catalytic sites are separated in space in CBS-PPase
(Figure 1). Therefore,
signal transfer between the sites requires coordinated movements of
multiple amino acid residues. In terms of the “induced-fit”
concept,23 the resting regulatory site
does not perfectly fit the nucleotide molecule to be bound, so the
binding event involves the displacement of protein ligands to establish
all interactions with the nucleotide. To generate a regulatory signal,
part of these interactions should act like a loaded spring and hence
destabilize the complex. As a corollary, replacement of the corresponding
amino acid residue with a neutral one, like alanine, should (a) stabilize
the complex and (b) suppress or cancel regulation. Furthermore, this “spring”
should extend to the active site to transmit the regulatory signal
to its destination, and hence, the above predictions are also valid
for all spring-forming residues. None of the residues substituted
in this study is a nucleotide ligand, disallowing direct inferences
on where the spring starts. However, the data in Figure 3A,B identify two intermediate
residues with the predicted effects of the mutation—Arg295
and Asn312. Indeed, the mutation of Arg295 to Ala or Leu decreased
the mean binding constant, √KN1KN2, for AMP by approximately 20-fold
and increased the residual activity of the AMP complex 5–10-fold.
These mutations exerted similar, although smaller effects on the strength
of ATP binding, cancelling or even reversing its activating effect
(Figure 3A). The Asn312A
replacement had similar effects on the binding of AMP and ATP and
their modulating effects on activity (Figure 3A,B). The correlation between the effects
of the substitutions on the regulation by AMP and ATP suggests that
ligand-mediated inhibition and activation are transmitted through
the same residues. One can further speculate that the inhibiting nucleotides
increase the strain in the spring, whereas the activating nucleotides
partially release it.

Our previously published data on the N312S
variant of dhPPase17 are
fully consistent with these
inferences. The substitution decreased √KN1KN2 for AMP binding by approximately
4-fold and increased the residual activity of the complex by 10-fold.
In contrast, the R276A substitution increased the residual activity
of the AMP complex by 13-fold,18 as expected
for a spring-forming residue, but had a different effect on √KN1KN2 for AMP (a
12-fold increase). Similar effects on AMP binding and regulation were
previously observed upon R168A and R187G substitutions in the DRTGG
domain-lacking Moorella thermoacetica CBS-PPase,24 wherein Arg168 and Arg187
correspond to dhPPase Arg276 and Arg295, respectively.

Regulation of CBS domain-containing enzymes and transporters by
nucleotides is attributed to their modulation of the internal inhibition
imposed by the CBS domains on protein function.25 Several lines of evidence support this concept in the case
of CBS-PPase. They include the findings that CBS-PPases exhibit a
diminished activity (by one to three orders of magnitude) compared
with their close homologues lacking CBS domains26 and that nucleotides may inhibit (AMP and ADP) or activate
(ATP and diadenosine polyphosphates) this enzyme. Furthermore, several
mutations in CBS domains activated CBS-PPase of M.
thermoacetica and some even reversed the effect of
nucleotide from inhibition to activation,24 resembling the effects of mutations in cystathionine β-synthase27 and AMP-dependent protein kinase.28,29 Finally, deletion of the regulatory domains in dhPPase favorably changed (decreased) its Km values.15

The results of this study
support and further extend the concept
of internal inhibition induced in CBS-PPase by the regulatory insert.
In terms of the mechanical model of CBS-PPase regulation, internal
inhibition is caused by a strain at the interface of the regulatory
and catalytic domains, which is transmitted to the active site and
distorts it. The pathways through which the signals from the regulatory
insert itself and bound nucleotides reach the active site seem both
involve Arg295 and Asn312 and hence overlap, at least partially. This
inference comes from the finding that Arg295 modifications suppressed
catalytic activity by two orders of magnitude and simultaneously enhanced
its activation by Ap4A, such that the activity of the Ap4A-activated R295A and R295E variants was comparable with the
activity of the wild-type enzyme. Of note, these findings add to the
knowledge that, despite the low activity of the variant enzymes, the
substitutions did not disrupt the protein structure. Apparently, the
substitutions aggravated the internal inhibition by CBS domains, but
this effect was largely reversed by Ap4A binding. Furthermore,
we found that the removal of the charged side chain in Arg295 or the
polar side chain in Asn312 converted ATP from an activator to an inhibitor.
The Arg295 modification similarly reversed the activating effect of
Ap5A (Table 1).

Cooperativity of monoadenosine phosphate binding suggests
that
another spring joins the CBS domains of two subunits in dimeric CBS-PPase.
DRTGG domains do not appear to be involved in nucleotide-binding cooperativity,
as this has also been exhibited by the CBS-PPases, which lack DRTGG
domains in their structures.15 Only Arg295
but not Asn312 or any other replaced residue is involved in this type
of cooperativity, as it was appreciably suppressed or, ultimately,
reversed only upon the removal of the Arg295 guanidino group (Figure 3C). In contrast,
replacements of Asn312 (N312A and N312S) dramatically increased the
cooperativity of AMP binding (Table S3 and
ref (17)), which may
mean that Asn312 interactions counteract this type of cooperativity.
The effect of the Asn312 substitutions on ATP binding was much smaller,
if any (Table S5). Ap4A bound
noncooperatively in wild type and all variant dhPPases,
consistent with its binding stoichiometry of 1 mole/mole dimer.12,14

Yet another spring connects active sites in CBS-PPase, causing
positive kinetic cooperativity, as manifested by the decreased Michaelis
constant for the second bound substrate molecule. We found earlier
that this type of cooperativity was eliminated by the N312S substitution.17 The importance of Asn312 for kinetic cooperativity
is supported by the N312A data (Figure 5C). Consistent with this, the N312A variant exhibited
a lower mean Michaelis constant (√Km1Km2) in comparison with the wild-type
enzyme (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, our new data suggest that Arg334 also plays a role in
kinetic cooperativity, as R334A substitution also made the hydrolysis
kinetics noncooperative (Figure 5C), despite the fact that it did not decrease √Km1Km2. One should
keep in mind that this parameter is a combination of rate constants,
rather than a binding constant, and its increase does not necessarily
imply the increased strain on the spring.

A surprising effect
of Ap4A was to eliminate or greatly
decrease kinetic cooperativity in different CBS-PPases14 and the dhPPase variants with
substituted Ser266, Glu267, and Lys269 residues (Figure 5C). This may mean that the
cross-linking Ap4A molecule fixes the active site-connecting
spring in one position or completely relaxes it, for instance, by
disrupting the contact between the catalytic DHH domains. In a sharp
contrast, Ap4A induced a very high positive kinetic cooperativity
in the variants with substituted Arg295 and Asn312 residues and less
so in the Arg334 variants (Figure 5C). A likely corollary is that a cross-linking Ap4A molecule somehow restores intersubunit contact through DHH
domains or replaces it in the variants with substituted Asn312 and
Arg334 residues. However, these interpretations may be inappropriate
with the Arg295-substituted variants, as they retained kinetic cooperativity
in the absence of nucleotides (Figure 5C). Further structural studies are clearly needed to
explain the opposite effects of Ap4A on kinetic cooperativity
in different variants.

The following note is appropriate at
the point. A classical view
of allosteric effects, including binding cooperativity, implies a
conformational change induced by ligand binding to a remote site.
However, an increasing body of evidence supports a different, entropic
concept that relies upon changes in the dynamic fluctuations about
the mean conformation with no change in the mean conformation itself.30,31 A combination of the “conformational” and “entropic”
mechanisms is also possible. Our mechanical description of cooperativity
is applicable to both mechanisms, depending to what is assumed to
load “springs”—static displacements of atoms
or changes in their dynamic behavior.

Because the substrate
itself binds cooperatively to CBS-PPase in
the absence of nucleotides, the apparent nucleotide binding cooperativity,
which was also inferred from activity measurements, might be induced
by the bound substrate or by nucleotide-mediated modulation of substrate
binding. However, lack of correlation between the effects of the mutations
on kinetic and nucleotide binding cooperativities (Figures 3C and 5C) apparently refutes such a mechanism. The absence of a causative
link between the cooperativities of binding to two types of sites
in CBS-PPase is also consistent with the previous finding that the
AMP- and ATP-binding cooperativity in dhPPase does
not depend significantly on substrate concentration.15

Table 2 summarizes
the functional consequences of all heretofore described substitutions
in the CBS and DHH domain residues that were deemed important for
the regulation of CBS-PPase. These data identify four residues that
are indeed important: arginines 276, 295, and 334 and asparagine 312.
Substitutions of two of these residues, Arg295 and Asn312, affected
practically all parameters associated with the three regulatory signal
pathways connecting the active sites, the regulatory sites, and the
regulatory and active sites. Noteworthy, Ethanoligenens
harbinense CBS-PPase, which has leucine and serine
in the positions corresponding to dhPPase Arg295
and Asn312, respectively, is not regulated by adenine nucleotides
and exhibits no kinetic cooperativity.17 Furthermore, these residues appear to be involved in the internal
inhibition imposed by the regulatory domains in the absence of nucleotides.
Arg334, like the previously explored Arg276,18 is essential for signal transduction between the catalytic domains
of different subunits. However, Arg334 differs from Arg276 in that
it is not involved in signal transduction between the regulatory and
catalytic domains within one subunit, as Arg334 substitution with
alanine did not appreciably change the effects of nucleotides on activity.
Noteworthy, positions 295, 312, and 334 are almost invariant or, rarely,
conservatively replaced in hundreds of CBS-PPase sequences (Figure S1).

Modeling and MD simulation experiments
on B. subtilis PPase, which contains
only catalytic DHH and DHHA2 domains in its
structure, provided a likely structural explanation for the roles
of Asn312 and Arg334 in kinetic cooperativity in dhPPase. These experiments indicate that replacements with alanine
of the corresponding Asn77 and Arg99 residues destabilize subunit
contact through the DHH domains (Figure 6), thus hampering signal transfer between
active sites. Modeling the behavior of the Arg295-substituted variants
could not be performed in the same way because Arg295 belongs to the
CBS domain, not found in B. subtilis PPase. It is unlikely that the effect of Arg295 substitution is
also associated with the modification of DHH–DHH contact because
the Arg295-substituted variants exhibited positive kinetic cooperativity
in the absence of adenine nucleotides (Figure 5C). In the structure of the regulatory part
of C. perfringens CBS-PPase, the guanidino
group of the corresponding Arg296 residue forms four H-bonds with
other residues, and their disruption by R/A or R/L mutation may have
an unpredictable effect on the enzyme structure and function.

In conclusion, our data define the roles for two amino acid residues,
Arg295 and Arg334, as important in the activity regulation of CBS-PPase
and support the previously assigned role of Asn312 in regulation.
In more general terms, the results of this study attest to the usefulness
of CBS domain-containing pyrophosphatase as a model enzyme to study
the general principles of protein regulation via CBS domains, at the
same time emphasizing a critical requirement for the structure of
a full-size enzyme for further progress.

Experimental Section
Materials
Wild-type dhPPase (UniProtKB:
B8FP42) and its variants containing a His6 tag at their
N-termini were isolated from E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the pET-28b vector (Novagen) carrying
the corresponding gene, as described previously.18 Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using overlap extension
PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase. The purity of the final products
was estimated by SDS-PAGE32 with Coomassie
staining. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically,
using an A0.1%280 value of
0.477, as calculated from the amino acid composition with ProtParam.
Molar concentrations were calculated on the basis of a subunit molecular
mass of 62.5 kDa for the His6-tagged protein.

AMP
(free acid), ADP (diammonium salt), ATP (disodium salt), Ap4A (ammonium salt), and Ap5A (pentasodium salt) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. The concentrations of nucleotide stock solutions
were estimated by measuring absorbance at 259 nm (ε = 15,900
M–1 cm–1 for the mononucleotides
and 31,800 M–1 cm–1 for the dinucleotides).

Kinetic Assays
The activity assay medium contained
5 mM free Mg2+ ion (added as MgCl2), 50 μM
MgPPi complex (added as tetrasodium PPi), and
0.1 M Tes-KOH or Mops-KOH buffer, pH 7.2, except where specified otherwise.
Reactions were initiated by adding an enzyme, and Pi accumulation
due to PPi hydrolysis was continuously recorded for 2–3
min at 25 °C using an automated Pi analyzer33 at a sensitivity of 4–20 μM Pi per recorder scale. Initial velocity values were proportional
to enzyme concentration and generally agreed within 5–10% in
replicate measurements.

Bioinformatics Analysis
CBS-PPase
protein sequences
were retrieved by BLAST from the NCBI Protein34 and KEGG GENES35 databases. Protein sequences
were aligned with ClustalX (version 2.1) using default settings. The
alignment was manually processed by eliminating incomplete and redundant
sequences and sequence regions that included indels and ambiguously
aligned residues. Protein structures were visualized and analyzed
using UCSF Chimera.36

ThermoFluor
Measurements20
Thermostability
measurements were performed using a C1000 thermal
cycler with the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The
assay mixtures with a total volume of 50 μL, placed in transparent
low-profile 96-well multiplate PCR plates (SSIbio), contained 5–8
μM enzyme, 0.02% SYPRO Orange dye (Invitrogen), 0.1 M Mops-KOH
buffer, pH 7.2 (measured at 25 °C), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1
mM CoCl2, and 150 mM KCl. The plates were closed with an
UltraFlux Standard PCR sealing film (SSIbio) and heated from 30 to
100 °C with stepwise increments of 0.5 °C and a 20 s hold
step for every point. Fluorescence was monitored at 552 nm (second
channel, VIC filter), and melting temperatures, Tm, were determined from the resulting curves with CFX
Manager software.

Sedimentation Analysis
Analytical
ultracentrifugation
was performed at 25 °C in a Spinco E instrument (Beckman Instruments)
equipped with a computerized data collection unit, with scanning at
280 nm. Samples contained 10–20 μM CBS-PPase, 0.1 M Mops/KOH
buffer, pH 7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CoCl2, and
150 mM KCl. Prior to each run, samples were incubated for 6 h at 25
°C. The sedimentation velocity was measured at 60,000 rpm, and
sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) were
calculated with the program SedFit.37

Molecular Dynamics (MD)
Virtual mutations and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with dimeric canonical B.
subtilis PPase, which lacks the regulatory CBS-DRTGG-CBS
insert, were carried out essentially as described previously.17 MD simulations were performed using the PMEMD
program (CUDA implementation) of the AMBER 14 software suite with
the ff14SB force field (http://ambermd.org/). The 8 Å cutoff production MD simulation was performed for
750 ns for each variant protein, with snapshots saved every 10 ps.
Post-processing trajectory analyses were carried out with the program
CPPTRAJ of the AMBER 14 pack.

Data Analysis and Calculations
Nucleotides effects
on activity at a fixed substrate concentration were analyzed in terms
of Scheme 1, written
in terms of microscopic binding constants, like in our latest publication.18 Use of microscopic constants simplified analysis
in comparison to the use of macroscopic constants in previous analyses14,15,17 without effect on its results.
The microscopic and macroscopic binding (and Michaelis) constants
are linked by the following relationships: KN1(micro) = 2KN1(macro), KN2(micro) = 0.5KN2(macro).38 The dependences of the hydrolysis
rate (vN) on nucleotide concentration
([N]) were fit to eq 1.18 In the framework of Scheme 1, binding cooperativity can
be diagnosed by comparing the KN constants: KN1 > KN2 indicates
positive cooperativity, KN1 < KN2 indicates negative cooperativity, and KN1 = KN2 is indicative
of noncooperative behavior. Decreases in the free nucleotide concentration
because of binding to the enzyme could be neglected in all cases,
except for the pair R295A variant/Ap4A. In the latter case, eq 1 was fitted to the binding
data together with mass balance equations for the enzyme and nucleotide.
According to eq 1, the
midpoint of the v/[E]0 versus [N] profile
is achieved at nucleotide concentration equal to √KN1KN2. 1  

The cooperative
kinetics
of substrate (MgPPi) hydrolysis is described by Scheme 2, which assumes different
microscopic Michaelis constants (Km1 and Km2) and equal kcat values for two active sites in the dimer (K-type kinetic cooperativity).38 The rate equation for Scheme 2 is given by eq 2, where v is the reaction rate, and
[E]0 and [S] are the
total enzyme and substrate concentrations, respectively.18 As in the case of nucleotide binding, Km1 > Km2 implies
positive and Km1 < Km2 implies negative kinetic cooperativity. According to eq 2, half-maximal activity
is achieved at a substrate concentration equal to √Km1Km2. 2  

Alternatively, rate dependences on substrate
and nucleotide concentrations
were fit to eq 3 3  where h is
the Hill coefficient, L is S or N, and vL is the rate at infinite [L].

The total concentrations of MgCl2 and PPi required to maintain desired concentrations
of MgPPi (actual
substrate) and 5 mM free Mg2+ ion in the activity assay
mixture at pH 7.2 were calculated taking into account the following
magnesium complexes: MgPPi, Mg2PPi, MgAMP, MgADP, and MgATP.18 Nonlinear
least-squares fittings were performed using the program Scientist
(Micromath).
