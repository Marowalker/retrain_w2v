N,S-Doped activated
carbon was directly prepared via a facile and
cost-efficient hydrothermal reaction, followed by alkali activation
of elm flower (EL)-derived biomass. The EL-derived activated carbon
(ELAC) had N and S contents of 2.21 and 6.06 atom %, respectively,
in addition to a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area of 2048.6 m2 g–1 and moderate pore
volume of 0.88 cm3 g–1. Owing to its
high BET surface area and N/S functional groups, ELAC achieved a specific
capacitance of 275 F g–1 at a current density of
1 A g–1 and retained a capacitance of 216 F g–1 at 20 A g–1. In addition, a symmetric
supercapacitor based on N,S-self-doped ELAC electrode provided a capacitance
of 62 F g–1 at a current density of 10 A g–1, with maximum energy and power densities of 16.8 Wh kg–1 and 600 W kg–1, respectively. The capacitance
retention was also high, at 87.2%, at 4 A g–1 after
5000 cycles.

1 Introduction
With
the increasing global fossil-fuel consumption and aggravating
environmental pollution, alternative eco-friendly energy sources are
of great importance. Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical
capacitors, are promising energy-storage devices.1−3 Owing to their
long lifetime and fast charge–discharge properties, supercapacitors
have been extensively studied and used in experimental settings.4,5 On the basis of their energy-storage mechanism, they can be classified
as either electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) or pseudocapacitors.
Pseudocapacitors are based on Faradic processes, whereas EDLCs are
based on electrostatic charging at the electrode–electrolyte
interface. Therefore, the specific surface area of its electrode significantly
influences its capacitance.6

Among
various carbon materials that can be used as electrodes in
supercapacitors,7−9 activated carbon is advantageous because of its high
specific surface area and relatively low cost. Heteroatom doping contributes
to the improvement in electrochemical performance of activated carbon
by altering its electron–donor properties. Doping with nitrogen
or sulfur improves capacitive performance by reducing charge transfer
resistance and increasing the wettability between electrolyte and
electrode, effectively enhancing electrochemical performance.10−12 Nitrogen doping has been performed with both organic and inorganic
nitrogen sources,13−16 urea,17,18 and ammonia.19,20 In 2011, corncob-derived,
nitrogen-doped activated carbon was obtained by KOH activation in
NH3 atmosphere.19 The resulting
electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 185 F g–1 in the organic electrolyte. Similarly, sulfur doping
is also important in energy-storage processes.21−23 Sulfur-doped
activated carbon was obtained by directly mixing sulfur flakes with
activated carbon and subsequently pyrolyzing the mixture.24 The sulfur-doped activated carbon contained
many thiophene functional groups on its surface, which improve the
conductivity of electrode materials. Alternatively, activated carbon
can be simultaneously doped with sulfur and nitrogen.25,26 The presence of sulfur improves the pseudocapacitive performance,28,29 whereas that of nitrogen improves the electron-transfer properties
of the carbon material.19 For example,
willow-catkin-derived nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous carbon nanosheets
were prepared by KOH activation with thiourea as a precursor to both
N and S atoms.27 Overall, these studies
indicate that activated carbon with a high specific surface area and
moderate heteroatom doping exhibits good capacitive performance.

Herein, we successfully prepared activated carbon samples derived
from elm flower (EL) biomass, which were found to contain significant
amounts of self-doped nitrogen and sulfur. Elm tree is a virescence
tree, ubiquitous in northern China. Elm flowers mature at the end
of spring and represent a cheap and accessible biomass source for
activated carbon samples with high specific surface area.30 Moreover, these are usually burned or piled
up casually, presenting an environmental problem. Thus, their conversion
into activated carbon offers a practical removal method. We showed
that the EL-derived activated carbon (ELAC) exhibits a high specific
surface area (2048.57 m2 g–1) and moderate
N and S contents (2.12 and 6.06 atom %, respectively). As a supercapacitor
electrode material, ELAC displays good capacitive performance and
decent rate capability both in three- and two-electrode systems.

2 Results and Discussion
The preparation of nitrogen
and sulfur self-doped ELAC is illustrated
in Figure 1a. The biomass
raw materials, EL, were collected from the ground and subjected to
hydrothermal treatment and KOH activation. The harsh conditions of
hydrothermal treatment led to the partial carbonization, hydrolysis,
and partial dissolution of noncrystalline regions of the two-dimensional
biomass materials.33 Furthermore, the process
decreased the crystallinity and connection between microfibers of
the samples. However, their elemental composition was conserved after
the hydrothermal process34 and their porosity
increased with the amount of KOH during the activation process. KOH
activation also diminished the amount of spherical structures and
increased that of porelike structures. The products were denoted by
N,S-ELAC-x, where x is the mass
ratio between KOH and HEL. Both macro- and micropores were observed
within the pore structure, indicating successful KOH activation of
the HEL (Figure 1b).

and (e) Raman spectra of the as-prepared N,S-ELAC-x.

The specific surface area and
pore structures of N,S-ELAC-x were further studied
by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm measurements. As shown in Figure 1c, N,S-ELAC-1 (KOH/HEL mass ratio 1:1) provided
a typical type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherm,35 which exists as an hysteresis loop at high relative
pressure. The typical type-I adsorption–desorption isotherms
obtained from increasing KOH mass ratios in the N,S-ELAC-2 and N,S-ELAC-3
samples suggest the presence of micropores.36 Prominent peaks in the PSD (inset in Figure 1c) are observed at 0.58, 0.86, 1.17, 1.58,
and 2.1 nm. Table 1 summarizes the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area and pore structure characterization parameters of the as-prepared
materials. As shown in Figure S1, the HEL
mainly exhibited spherical amorphous carbon structures with small
specific surface area.

KOH activation led to a remarkable increase in the
specific surface
area, from 6.13 (HEL) to 2638.9 m2 g–1 (N,S-ELAC-1). Although pore volume was not detected in the preactivated
material (Table 1),
indicating blocked pore texture, KOH activation resulted in a porous
structure.37 The N,S-ELAC-1, N,S-ELAC-2,
and N,S-ELAC-3 KOH-treated samples had total pore volumes of 1.23,
0.88, and 0.83 cm3 g–1, respectively.
The porous structure and significantly higher specific surface area
of these samples improve the accessibility of ions at high charge/discharge
rates and reduce the ion transport time from the electrolyte to electrode,
which is one of the main factors necessary for satisfactory power
performance.17,38 At a KOH/HEL ratio above unity,
increasing concentrations of KOH decreased the specific surface area,
from 2048.6 m2 g–1 (N,S-ELAC-2) to 1928.8
m2 g–1 (N,S-ELAC-3), as excessive quantity
of KOH leads to pore structure collapse.39,40

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the KOH-activated materials
(Figure 1d) revealed
two broad and weak peaks at 22.3 and 43.8° that can be ascribed
to (002) and (100) reflections of the disordered carbon layer, respectively.41 The presence of a weak and broad (002) peak
suggests the formation of a microporous structure after direct KOH
activation. The spectrum of N,S-ELAC-2 sample exhibited a relatively
sharper (100) peak, which implies a relatively higher degree of graphitization
among the carbon atoms.41,42 The chemical structure
and degree of disorder were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy
(Figure 1e). The D
band at 1337 cm–1 is attributed to structural defects
and impurities, whereas the G band at 1594 cm–1 corresponds
to in-plane stretching vibrations of sp2 hybridized carbon
in graphite crystallites.36,43 High-integrated intensity
ratios (ID/IG) for N,S-ELAC-1 (1.16), N,S-ELAC-2 (1.17), and N,S-ELAC-3 (1.18)
were attributed to increased disorder and defect structure in the
KOH-activated carbon materials. In addition, these also indicate an
increase in the content of oxygen-containing functional groups in
as-prepared N,S-ELAC-x samples.44

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were
observed to
identify the porosity of the samples. As shown in Figure 2a–c, N,S-ELAC-2 clearly
contains abundant micropore structures, consistent with the BET results.
In addition, a high-resolution TEM image proved the existence of a
disordered carbon structure at the edge of the material (Figure 2d). The elemental
composition of the as-prepared materials was determined by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Figure 3), which revealed S, C, N, and O contents, as evidenced by
the presence of peaks at 165, 284, 400, and 532 eV, respectively.
HEL had a high S content (15.59 atom %) and a moderate N content (2.61
atom %) (Table 1).
After KOH activation, the HEL exhibited an average S content of 6.06
atom % with no significant change in the N content. On the basis of
these findings, we expect that N,S-ELAC-2 will have optimum capacitive
properties.

N,S-ELAC-2.

1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s, and (d) S 2p spectra
of the N,S-ELAC-2.

The high-resolution C
1s, N 1s, O 1s, and S 2p spectra of N,S-ELAC-2
are shown in Figure 3. The C 1s spectrum (Figure 3a) can be deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 284.8 (52.49%),
285.3 (12.82%), 286.3 (14.88%), and 289.3 eV (19.78%), assigned to
sp2-C hybridized C=C bonds, C–O/C–N
bonds, C–O/C–S bonds, and O–C=C/O–C–N
bonds,45,46 respectively. The deconvoluted N 1s spectrum
(Figure 3b) presented
peaks at 398.5 (3.5%), 400.0 (43.25%), 401.4 (44.7%), and 403 (37.8%)
eV, corresponding to pyridinic, pyrrolic, quaternary N atoms, and
N oxides, respectively.47 The presence
of pyridinic, pyrrolic, quaternary N atoms, and N oxides promotes
the ion transport from the electrolyte to electrode material, effectively
enhancing the capacitive properties. Quaternary N atoms and N oxides
also increase the capacitance of electrode materials.31 The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted (Figure 3c) into two peaks at 532 (32.17%)
and 533.4 (67.83%) eV, corresponding to O–C and O–N
bonds, respectively.38 For the S 2p spectrum
(Figure 3d), three
peaks at 164.4 (52.16%), 165.6 (26.08%), and 169.3 (21.75%) eV were
observed upon deconvolution, corresponding to S 2p3/2,
S 2p1/2, and oxidized sulfur, respectively. The dominant
S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks result from the spin–orbit
coupling between thiophene sulfur atoms. The presence of sulfur atoms
can also enhance energy storage by increasing the pseudocapacitance
of the electrode.24

The electrochemical
performance of N,S-ELAC-x as
a supercapacitor electrode material was first tested in a three-electrode
system and evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic
charge–discharge (GCD) measurements. The CV curves of activated
N,S-ELAC-x were measured at the scan rates ranging
from 2 to 50 mV s–1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte (Figure 4a–c). The
rectangular voltammetry curve over a potential window of −1
to −0.1 V indicated that the electrochemical behavior corresponds
to that of a typical electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) created
at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The curves for the
three KOH-activated materials are shown in Figure 4d. At 2 mV s–1, N,S-ELAC-2
exhibited higher current density responses and higher specific capacitances.
Moreover, the redox peaks were related to several of heteroatom-containing
functional groups in the as-prepared materials.48

at different scan rates. (d) Comparison of N,S-ELAC-x at the scan rate of 2 mV s–1.

The GCD curves of the KOH-activated N,S-ELAC-x samples tested at six different current densities ranging from 1
to 20 A g–1 are shown in Figure 5a–c. These exhibited relatively good
linearity and had a nearly symmetrical triangular shape, suggesting
charge storage via double-layer mechanism. The higher discharge time
of N,S-ELAC-2 compared to that of either N,S-ELAC-1 or N,S-ELAC-3
indicates that N,S-ELAC-2 has a relatively higher specific capacitance.
Columbic efficiency was also calculated on the basis of the ratio
of discharge/charge time.52−54 As shown in Figure S2, the as-obtained N,S-ELAC-x samples
displayed higher efficiency. The specific capacitance of the three
KOH-activated samples (calculated using eq 1) at six current densities ranging from 1
to 20 A g–1 is illustrated in Figure 5d. At 1 A g–1, N,S-ELAC-2
provided a capacitance of 275 F g–1. Furthermore,
at 20 A g–1, a maximum specific capacitance of 216
F g–1 was retained, suggesting excellent rate performance
with 78.5% capacity retention (Figure 5d).

The electrochemical properties of other heteroatom-doped
carbon
materials are shown in Table 2, which include those derived from willow catkin,27 bamboo,49 corncobs,19 banana peels,50 and
cotton51 biomass. However, the key difference
between the heteroatom-doped activated carbon materials listed in Table 2 and our ELAC is that
the former adopted an extraneous source (or precursor) for their heteroatom,
adding considerable cost and time to the procedure, whereas ours derived
its N,S-doped heteroatom directly from the biomass material (i.e.,
they are self-doped). The specific surface area of ELAC is higher
compared to that of previously reported paulownia flower-based carbon
materials.55 The abundant micropores improve
electrolyte contact and enhance the electrochemical performance. The
sulfur functional groups also increase wettability and electrical
conductivity and, consequently, the electrochemical performance. Accordingly,
we successfully prepared self-doped activated carbon material with
a maximum specific capacitance of 216 F g–1 at 20
A g–1. Moreover, the ELAC also exhibited a relatively
high specific surface area with capacitance comparable to the highest
values reported in other studies. The main factors for a satisfactory
specific capacitance in electrode include high specific surface area
and the N/S surface functional groups.

A two-electrode symmetric
capacitor was assembled with N,S-ELAC-2,
the best-performing electrode in the study. This was tested in 6 M
KOH electrolyte with a maximum mass loading of 10 mg. The symmetric
capacitor performance at different voltages and a fixed scan rate
of 50 mV s–1 is shown in Figure 6a. At 1.2 V, the rectangular shape of the
CV curve persisted, demonstrating that the symmetric capacitor can
be reversibly cycled within the voltage window of 0–1.2 V.
The GCD curves of the symmetric capacitor at different current densities
of 0.5–10 A g–1 (Figure 6b) show that their good linearity and symmetrical
triangular shape were retained. The specific capacitance values, calculated
using eq 1 (Figure 6c), achieved up to
84 F g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 for the entire electrode. Moreover, at 10 A g–1, the maximum capacitance was 62 F g–1. The average
power density of the symmetric capacitor increased from 600 to 12 000
W kg–1 with the current density (Figure 6d). The energy density of the
symmetric capacitor remains at 12.4 Wh kg–1 at a
power density of 12 000 W kg–1, higher than
that of previously reported carbon symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous
electrolyte, such as glucose-based porous carbon (7.01 Wh kg–1 at 7200 W kg–1),56 mesoporous
carbon nanospheres (9.1 Wh kg–1 at 3200 W kg–1),57 and chemical-modified
graphene (5.2 Wh kg–1 at 4000 W kg–1).58 After 5000 cycles, the capacitance
retention of the as-prepared symmetric capacitor was 87.2%, suggesting
excellent long-term cycling stability (Figure 6e,f). The cycling durability of the symmetric
supercapacitor was confirmed by the GCD curves after 5000 cycles in Figure 6d. Observably, the
curves were nearly symmetric, resembling that from previous cycle.
These findings demonstrate that nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon
derived from elm flower is a good material for applications in energy
conversion and storage devices. The electrochemical results revealed
that ELAC material is viable as a high-performance supercapacitor
electrode.

3 Conclusions
A novel
N,S-doped activated carbon has been successfully fabricated
from elm flowers via a facile prehydrothermal reaction and KOH activation
for supercapacitors. Through adjusting the mass ratio of KOH to the
prehydrothermal carbonized elm flowers, the resultant N,S-doped activated
carbon possesses a high specific surface area, moderate pore volume,
and abundant functional groups. And the as-synthesized N,S-doped activated
carbon electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance (275 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 and 216 F g–1 at 20 A g–1). In addition, the assembled symmetric
supercapacitors based on this material demonstrated an energy density
of 16.8 Wh kg–1 and power density of 600 W Kg–1, as well as a stable cycle life over 5000 at 4 A
g–1. These high performances demonstrate that the
N,S-doped activated carbon derived from elm flowers is a good potential
material in energy conversion and storage devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Elm flowers were
collected from Shihezi University (China, Xinjiang Province) in April.
To remove impurities, elm flowers were repeatedly washed with deionized
water. The samples were dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and the flowers
were crushed into powder subsequently. Powdered elm flowers of 2 g
were added to 2.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and 50 mL of deionized
water in a 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction
occurred at 180 °C for 48 h. Thereafter, the mixture was cooled
at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, was filtered, washed
with deionized water, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The resulting
hydrothermally treated sample (HEL) was thoroughly mixed with KOH
in separate agate mortars at mass ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. They
were preactivated at 400 °C for 30 min and then heated to 700
°C for an additional 1 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace.
The activated products were then washed with 10% v/v HCl and deionized
water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the activated carbon
samples, containing both nitrogen and sulfur, were accordingly labeled
N,S-ELAC-x, where x represents the
mass ratio between KOH and HEL in the corresponding sample.

4.2 Material Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation. The specific surface areas were calculated
according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
The pore size distribution (PSD) of the samples was obtained from
density functional theory method. The surface morphologies and microstructures
of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20).
Trace elements were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray mapping using
an ISIS-300 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was
performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) spectrometer
using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (h = 1486.6
eV) with 210 W. Raman characterization was conducted on a Horiba Jobin
Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer.

4.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
N,S-ELAC-x (5.0 mg) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
solution (1.0 μL,
60 wt %; Aladdin) were added to 1.0 mL of ethanol. The corresponding
suspension was sonicated for at least 30 min until homogenization.
This was then transferred into a rectangular Ni foam current collector
(1 cm × 1 cm) and vacuum dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The electrochemical
performance of the as-prepared electrode material was tested using
a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH electrolyte on an electrochemical
workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai). A platinum sheet and saturated calomel
electrode served as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) measurements were performed over a potential window of −1
to −0.1 V at different scan rates and current densities. Finally,
the specific capacitances of the as-prepared materials were calculated
from the GCD data by eq 1(31,32) 1  where C (F g–1) is the specific capacitance, I (A) is the charge/discharge
current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (mg) is the mass of the active material in the electrode,
and ΔV is the potential window.

The electrochemical
performance of the two-electrode system was evaluated by assembling
a symmetrical supercapacitor based on N,S-ELAC-2, with electrodes
prepared as previous. N,S-ELAC-2 (5 mg) and a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
solution (1.0 μL, 60 wt %, Aladdin) were added to 1.0 mL of
ethanol and then sonicated until homogenization. The solution was
then coated onto circular Ni foam current collectors (0.785 cm2) and vacuum dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The dried electrodes
were symmetrically assembled with cellulose membrane as the separator
and 6 M KOH as the electrolyte in a CR2032 stainless-steel coin cell.
CV and GCD analyses were conducted to evaluate the electrode performance. 2  where m (mg) is the total
mass of the electrode, I (A) is the charge/discharge
current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (mg) is the mass of the active material in the electrode,
and ΔV is the potential window. 3   4  where E (Wh kg–1) is the specific
energy density, P (W kg–1) is the
specific power density of the symmetrical supercapacitor
system, C (F g–1) is the specific
capacitance of the total symmetrical system, and ΔV is the potential window of discharge.
