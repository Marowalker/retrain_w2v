The following work
investigates the heterogeneous nucleation of
2-oleodistearin (SOS) triglycerides on surfaces formed by crystals
of tristearin triglyceride (SSS). This work shows, through computer
simulations and nucleation kinetics, that SOS may heterogeneously
nucleate on SSS surfaces. Atomic-scale molecular dynamics showed that
SOS molecules exhibited an affinity to a simulated SSS surface. Nucleation
kinetics using differential scanning calorimetry showed that the inclusion
of minor amounts of SSS (from 1 to 4%) in an SOS melt resulted in
an increase in the isothermal nucleation rate of crystallizing SOS.
Using a model based on the Fisher–Turnbull approach, estimates
of the surface free energy, activation free energy, and the critical
radius were calculated from the nucleation rates. The estimated parameters
demonstrate the heterogeneous nucleation of SOS on SSS surfaces: reduced
surface free energies, activation free energies, and critical radii
with the inclusion of SSS in an SOS melt. This may point to strategies
to enhance the nucleation of one of the three major triglycerides
present in cocoa butter and the one that crystallizes first from the
melt for better control of the chocolate tempering process.

Introduction
Cocoa butter is a premium fat used in
the manufacture of confectionery
products such as chocolate bars and enrobed confectionery products.1 It consists predominantly of three triglycerides:
2-oleodistearin (SOS), 2-oleodipalmitin (POP), and 1-palmito-2-oleo-stearin
(POS). These 2-oleo-triglycerides collectively account for about 90%
of the triglycerides in cocoa butter.2 It
is generally agreed that cocoa butter can crystallize into six different
crystal forms (form I to form VI), which are subtypes of the three
polymorphic forms (α, β′, and β) into which
fats commonly crystallize into.3 Of the
six forms, form V is the most desirable polymorphic form as it results
in optimal textural and visual characteristics for chocolate.

To achieve the desired polymorphic form, chocolate mass must be
processed using a controlled temperature protocol known as tempering.
Achieving the desired polymorphic form can also be attained by seeding
the chocolate mix. Seeding is the addition of the preformed crystalline
material (called seeds) of the desired polymorphic form to facilitate
crystallization into the same polymorphic form as well as to accelerate
crystallization. It is commonly agreed that seeding facilitates crystallization
through a process called “secondary nucleation” although
an exact description of this phenomena remains elusive.4 The seed material is commonly cocoa butter although
novel fats chemically dissimilar to cocoa butter have also been used.5

Cocoa butter is an expensive fat. Due to
a combination of environmental,
economic, and political factors, the price of cocoa (from which cocoa
butter is derived) has surged considerably between the years 2013
to 2016, from approximately United States $2.15/kg (March 2013) to
$3.12/kg (June 2016). The price has since decreased to $2/kg (Sept
2017) but has risen to $2.66/kg as of May 2018.6 The volatility in cocoa prices as well as the vulnerability
of its supply has spurred the development of cocoa butter equivalents
(CBEs), fats that are chemically similar to cocoa butter. CBEs are
considered superior to cocoa butter replacers (fats with similar functionality
as cocoa butter but dissimilar chemical compositions such as palm
kernel oil) in that they can be blended with cocoa butter. In theory,
cocoa butter equivalents can be formulated by blending purified shea
stearin (rich in SOS) with purified palm mid-fraction (rich in POP).
Other CBEs can be formulated from single-cell sources such as algal
butters.7

An important consideration
in the formulation and use of CBEs is
the inevitable inclusion of minor components in the fat. Total removal
of these impurities would reduce or eliminate the economic incentive
to use CBEs. One such component is the trisaturated triglyceride tristearin
(SSS). Tristearin is naturally present in extracted cocoa butter at
mass percentages between 0.2 and 1.0% wt/wt, with the total amount
of trisaturated triglycerides typically between 2.0 and 4.0%.8,9 The impact of tristearin on the performance and functionality of
CBEs (as well as cocoa butter) is an important consideration, which
has merited considerable research attention.

Trisaturated triglycerides
such as SSS have higher melting points
than their corresponding sn-2-oleic acid triglycerides
such as SOS. The phase behavior of a simple binary mixture of SSS
and SOS was shown to be monotectic in that a single solid phase (with
a melting point intermediate between the two binary components) was
formed.10,11 In the analogous palmitic acid system (PPP/POP),
the same monotectic behavior was observed.12,11 In the solid phase formed by a mixture of SSS/SOS, the 2-oleodistearin
was shown to be more soluble in the tristearin, with a tristearin-majority
phase being able to take in up to about 50% SOS. SSS is not at all
soluble in SOS—the amount of SSS being taken into the solid
solution by the SOS-majority solid phase was very small, well below
the resolution of the phase diagram. Similar behavior was observed
for the PPP/POP system. Therefore, in an SSS/SOS mixture with a significant
amount (>1–2%) of SSS, SSS can be expected to crystallize
into
a solid phase separate from the SOS solid phase, prior to the crystallization
of SOS. This is evidenced as a clouding of cocoa butter at the start
of cocoa butter crystallization.

The impact of the crystallization
of the SSS fraction on the crystallization
of SOS is the subject of a long-running debate. Because SSS crystallizes
prior to the rest of the cocoa butter, there is considerable interest
in whether or not SSS can act as an indigenous seeding material in
cocoa butter. According to Talbot,13 the
significance of SSS in the crystallization of cocoa butter is not
in its ability to seed the crystallizing material but in its ability
to increase the viscosity of the crystallizing cocoa butter and thus
create an impediment during processing, such as in mold-filling and
enrobing.

Furthermore, according to Smith,14 trisaturated
triglycerides cannot act as seeds for the subsequent crystallization
of sn-2-oleic acid triglycerides (such as SOS) as
the crystalline structure of trisaturated triglycerides (2L) is different
from that of the sn-2-oleic acid triglycerides (3L).
Triglycerides crystallize by stacking in layers called lamellae. The
thickness of these lamellae is dependent on the triglycerides that
make up these lamellae. Trisaturated triglycerides stack in crystalline
lamellae with thicknesses that are twice the chain-lengths of the
constituent fatty acids (hence 2L) as saturated fatty acid chains
are generally complementary to other fatty acid chains provided the
chain length difference is not too great (more than four carbons).
However, sn-2-oleic acid triglycerides, because of
the kink introduced by the double bond of the sn-2-oleic
acid group, stack in crystalline lamellae that are 3 times the length
of the fatty acid chains. This minimizes the disruption of the crystal
structure introduced by the kink by effectively segregating the oleic
acid chains away from the saturated fatty acids attached at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

Hachiya
and others studied the effect of cocoa butter (in various
polymorphs), SOS (in various polymorphs), BOB (2-oleyl dibehenin,
in various polymorphs), and SSS (β polymorph) and their ability
to temper a mass of cocoa butter and dark chocolate.15 The efficacy of tempering was evaluated by how well the
seed material reduced the crystallization time, the time required
to reach a certain viscosity (evaluated as the torque in a model scraped-surface
heat exchanger). The efficacy of tempering was found to be strongly
dependent on the chemical species and the polymorph. The mechanism
of tempering was postulated to be secondary nucleation, whereby the
seed material (and fragments thereof) acted as nuclei for subsequent
crystal growth. SSS (in the β polymorph) was shown to reduce
the crystallization time but only by 10–20%, depending on the
amount of seed material added.

Wähnelt, Meusel, and Tülsner
added various diglycerides
and tripalmitin to cocoa butter and found that the addition of tripalmitin
(albeit at a concentration of 10%) reduced the onset time for crystallization.16 Loisel and others studied the addition of 0.3,
1.0, and 1.6% SSS to a dark chocolate (naturally containing 3.0% trisaturated
triglycerides) crystallized dynamically using a scraped-surface heat
exchanger.17 The dynamics of chocolate
crystallization were characterized by the torque changes necessary
to maintain a steady rate of rotation of the SSHE shaft. It was observed
that the addition of SSS reduced the time between the first and second
torque jumps (indicative of the acceleration of the crystallization
of SSS). As well, the addition of SSS increased the magnitude of the
second torque jump. Furthermore, the authors estimated the amount
of SSS that had crystallized and remained in solution. Of the 3% trisaturated
triglycerides present in cocoa butter, the authors estimated that,
at 28.2 °C (chosen to promote the crystallization of only the
β form of SOS), approximately 66% (that is, 2%) of the trisaturated
triglycerides remained in solution, whereas 33% (that is, 1%) crystallized
out of solution.

Campos and others (2009) studied the effect
of adding SSS at various
levels to cocoa butter. The addition of SSS increased the onset temperature
of crystallization from 17.08 to 22.23 °C and reduced the induction
time of crystallization from 36 to 22 min. This was attributed to
the assumed co-crystallization of the SSS with the higher melting
fraction of the cocoa butter. The co-crystallization of the SSS with
cocoa butter triacylglycerols (TAGs) was shown to reduce the thickness
of the crystalline TAG particles. The addition of SSS also reduced
the rate of transformation from the β′ polymorph to the
β polymorph. The addition of SSS also induced a softening effect
(reduction in the elastic bending modulus) in the solidified cocoa
butter. This was attributed to the reduction of the crystal-melt interfacial
energy (or surface energy) brought about by the introduction of increased
disorder due to the co-crystallization of SSS with cocoa butter triglycerides.18

The main method for measuring the nucleation
rate in crystallizing
fats, turbidometry, is inadequate in situations where other suspended
particles are present (such as chocolate mass) and in situations where
there is more than one crystallizing species (fractional crystallization).
This work presents studies on the measurement of nucleation rates
in the crystallization of SOS (a cocoa butter TAG) in the presence
of SSS. This work employs computer simulations (atomic-scale molecular
dynamics, ASMD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to advance
the following thesis: SSS can facilitate heterogeneous nucleation
of cocoa butter triglycerides such as SOS. The crystallization of
SSS creates planar methyl surfaces to which other TAGs can adsorb.
This TAG surface adsorption increases the nucleation rate by reducing
the surface energy penalty of the activation free energy of nucleation
(Figure 1).

of a cylindrical island of SOS triglycerides on an SSS surface.

Results and Discussion
Atomic-Scale Molecular
Dynamics
The ASMD results show
that in the case of the triglycerides SOS and OOS, the layered state
exhibits a lower free energy per molecule than the mixed state (Figure 2). In the case of
OSS and OSO, the error bars (root-mean-square) overlap, indicating
no free energy difference between the layered and mixed states. These
results suggest that SOS and OOS will exhibit an affinity for an SSS
surface, given that the free energy of the layered configuration of
these TAGs is lower than that of the corresponding mixed configurations.

the studied triglyceride in the specified state Q and the triolein
reference state Q′.

The affinity of SOS for the SSS surface supports the hypothesis
that SOS may heterogeneously nucleate on the SSS surface. An affinity
of SOS for the SSS surface implies a “wetting” of the
surface by SOS, which would reduce the activation free energy for
nucleation. The free energy for the homogeneous nucleation of a cylindrical
nucleus from the melt is the sum of two contributions, a bulk term
and a surface term: 1   2  where γs–l is the
interfacial free energy per unit area, r is the radius
of the cylinder, h is the height of the cylinder, VM is the molar volume of the solid, and μl and μs are the chemical potentials of the
liquid and solid phases, respectively. The chemical potential difference
is achieved via the supersaturation of the liquid phase.

Consider
the heterogeneous nucleation of a solid cylindrical SOS
nucleus on a surface, typically called the condensation nuclei or
CN, in homage to its origins in atmospheric phenomena. One face of
the cylindrical nucleus (with area πrh) would be in contact
with the CN surface (Figure 1). The surface term can be split into two terms and the free
energy of heterogeneous nucleation is written as: 3  where γs–CN is the
interfacial free energy between the SOS cylinder face and the CN.
If γs–CN is less than γs–l or even zero, then the heterogeneous free energy of nucleation is
effectively less than the homogeneous free energy of nucleation for
the same cylinder. Heterogeneous nucleation is, in essence, the minimization
of the surface between the solid-phase nuclei and the liquid phase
melt by “shielding” some of that surface via nucleation
on a foreign surface, the CN. For as long as γs–CN is lower than γs–l, heterogeneous nucleation
is always energetically more favorable than homogeneous nucleation.
As such, heterogeneous nucleation exhibits a higher nucleation rate
than homogeneous nucleation.

The simulation results can be interpreted
as a γs–CN that is lower than γs–l. Indeed, since γs–CN is
the interfacial free energy between two solid
phases, it can be assumed to be effectively zero. The simulation shows
that SOS and OOS, but not OSS or OSO, exhibit an affinity for the
SSS surface as shown by the lower free energy for the layered state
for SOS and OOS than for the mixed bulk state for SOS and OOS. The
affinity for the surface implies that SOS and OOS will bind to the
SSS surface, resulting in a lower surface free energy that will lead
to heterogeneous nucleation. An additional argument is that the affinity
of the SOS and OOS to the SSS surface “concentrates”
these triglycerides on the surface such that the collision frequency
necessary for nucleation is increased. As will be shown in the next
section, the affinity of SOS triglycerides to the SSS surface is manifested
as an increase in the nucleation rate of SOS in the presence of an
SSS surface.

Nucleation Kinetics Results
Induction
Time Measurements
The exothermal trace obtained
from the isothermal step (step #4) of the temperature program shows
a well-defined Gaussian peak (Figure 3). This peak is generated when the material in the
pan starts to crystallize. The more asymmetric the peak shapes become,
the lower is the supersaturation (i.e., higher isothermal temperature).
At sufficiently high temperatures (∼28 °C), multiple peaks
may sometimes be detected (Figure 4). This is assumed to be due to the crystallization
of various polymorphic forms. Due to the additional complexity introduced
by polymorphic transformations, the 28 °C temperature point was
not included in later free energy calculations via the Fisher–Turnbull
method.

Figure 4 Induction time of Shea Stearin 1 nucleated at 28 °C.

For fractionated shea stearin
containing approximately 80% SOS
by the peak area (Shea Stearin 1), the optimal temperatures for measuring
well-spaced induction times are between 23 and 28 °C. The optimal
temperature range for obtaining good induction time data is dependent
on the amount of crystallizable SOS in the material preparation. This
is not unexpected since a preparation containing more SOS achieves
the same supersaturation at a higher temperature than a preparation
containing less SOS.

Determination of the induction time is
subjective. Given that the
peak shapes are symmetric Gaussian peaks, a natural measure of the
induction time is the onset time, which is the time at the point of
intersection between the first tangent to the peak and the baseline
of the peak.

Table 1 tabulates
the onset induction time measured for materials with various amounts
of tristearin. Several trends can be noted in this data set. First
and most obvious is the reduction in the induction time (indicative
of a higher nucleation rate) with increasing undercooling, i.e., nucleation
at lower isothermal temperatures. Only one set of three experimental
replicates (n = 3) is shown in Table 1. The results were not averaged due to the
variability between each set of experimental replicates. However,
the trends within each set of experimental replicates are similar.
Each set of replicates was used to derive nucleation parameters. These
parameters are averaged and reported as such.

Second, for the same nucleation temperature, the data
shows that
the addition of increasing amounts of tristearin reduces the induction
time for nucleation. To illustrate this, contrast Figures 5 and 6. This effect is particularly pronounced for the high temperature
(28 °C) although at the lowest temperature (23 °C), a reduction
in the induction time can still be observed. This trend supports the
hypothesis that the addition of SSS to the SOS preparation results
in fractional crystallization of SSS prior to the crystallization
of SOS. The availability of SSS surfaces and the affinity of SOS for
this surface results in heterogeneous nucleation, which is manifested
as an increase in the nucleation rate (reduction in the induction
time), relative to a case where SSS is absent.

determined induction times for Shea Stearin
1.

Figure 6 Nucleation peaks and determined induction times
for Shea Stearin
1 + 3% SSS.

It must be noted that
the reduction in the induction time appears
to exhibit a minimum at a concentration of 3% SSS across all temperatures.
This trend must be interpreted with caution. The differences are minimal
and may likely not be significant in a statistical sense, particularly
since the measurement of the induction time can be variable between
different DSC pans of the same material. Indeed, repeated measurements
of the induction time of new preparations of the material can show
large variability (∼60 s).

The data for Shea Stearin
1 + 1% SSS at 28 °C shows that at
sufficiently high temperatures and low amounts of SSS, the induction
time is either comparable to that of the material with no added SSS.
An explanation for this phenomenon in Shea Stearin 1 may be that,
at such low concentrations of SSS, and at such a high nucleation temperature,
SSS is not supersaturated (if at all) to the extent that it crystallizes
fractionally before SOS nucleates. This is evident via the absence
of a small crystallization peak in the isothermal measurement step
(Figure 7) for Shea
Stearin 1 + 1% SSS at 28 °C. As such, even though tristearin
is compositionally present in the material, no surfaces are formed
that would promote heterogeneous nucleation and thus no reduction
in the induction time is observed. This observation further supports
the case for heterogeneous nucleation since the absence of surfaces
(crystallization of SSS) does not lead to a reduction in the induction
time.

Fisher–Turnbull
Results
Table 2 shows the slopes m determined
via linear regression of ln(τ·Tnucleation) vs 1/(Tnucleation·(ΔT)2) as per the Fisher–Turnbull model.
A melting point Tf for SOS of 34.76 ±
0.13 °C (n = 4) and a melting enthalpy of 99.99
± 2.49 J/g (n = 4) was used. This melting point
was determined from the peak temperature of melting traces of the
nucleated SOS (Figure 8), which were typically between 35 and 36 °C. This temperature
is roughly the melting point of the β′-3 polymorph (form
IV) of SOS, which was determined to be 36.5 °C.19 This suggests that the SOS crystallizes into the β′-3
polymorph directly from the melt. Over time (>2 weeks), the SOS
undergoes
a polymorphic transformation into the β1-3 polymorph
(form VI), which is manifested as a higher peak melting temperature
(Figure 9). The melting
point of the β1-3 polymorph was determined to be
approximately 43.0 °C.19

a Values are reported
as the average
± standard deviation of n = 3 repetitions.

The Fisher–Turnbull
data show that as the amount of SSS
is increased, the slope m decreases. The slope m can be interpreted as the constant of proportionality
of the inverse relationship between ΔGc and (ΔT)2. That is, in
the case of a lower slope, the concomitant change in the activation
free energy ΔGc is smaller for each
unit of change in the supercooling ΔT. This
suggests that as the amount of SSS is increased, the change in ΔGc becomes less supercooling-dependent. The relationship
between ΔGc and ΔT is not linear but rather parabolic due to the squaring of the supercooling
term.

The calculated interfacial free energy values γs–l are relatively low (by approximately 1 order of
magnitude) when
compared to the γs–l values determined by
Phipps20 for trisaturated triglycerides
using the Fisher–Turnbull equation. The values determined by
Phipps were on the order of ∼10 mJ/m2. However,
values determined by Ahmadi21 and others
using the same methodology ranged from approximately 0.1 to 5.0 mJ/m2.

The data in Table 2 suggests that there are three regimes (as separated
into three sections
in the table) of nucleation behavior. In the first region corresponding
to 0% SSS, the slope attains a relatively high value, which indicates
that the nucleation rate in the absence of SSS is very temperature-dependent.
This consequently results in relatively high activation free energies
at the given crystallization temperature. In the second region encompassing
SSS concentrations between 1 and 2%, the slope m decreases.
This suggests that the addition of SSS reduces the supercooling dependence
of the nucleation event. Consequently, the activation free energies
and interfacial free energies at a given supercooling are lower than
that of the material with no SSS added. In the region corresponding
to SSS concentrations between 3 and 4%, the slope m further decreases, which results in a reduction in the activation
free energy of nucleation.

This is reflected in the induction
time data in Table 1, which shows that the induction
times for the concentrations between 3 and 4% are essentially identical.
These trends are likewise reflected in the interfacial free energies,
which decrease as the amount of SSS is increased. Since the calculated
interfacial free energies can be assumed to be a weighted sum of the
interfacial free energies for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation,
a decrease in the interfacial energy with increasing SSS contents
indicates a greater preponderance of heterogeneous nucleation (increased
weight to heterogeneous nucleation). The data can therefore be interpreted
in the following manner. At concentrations of 1–2% SSS, the
amount of SSS surface formed is relatively low compared to the material
with 3–4% SSS. As such, the amount of available surface for
heterogeneous nucleation is much lower in the material with 1–2%
SSS than the material with 3–4% SSS. The amount of material
that can be heterogeneously nucleated in the material with 1–2%
SSS is thus lower and this is reflected in the lower interfacial free
energies.

Estimation of the Critical Radius
Table 3 tabulates
the heterogeneous
critical radius (assuming a cylindrical geometry) of an SOS island
nucleating on an SSS surface (for materials with 1–4% SSS),
assuming an effective γs–l provided in Table 2. The critical radius
decreases with decreasing nucleation temperatures (higher supersaturation)
and increasing SSS contents. The first result is expected from nucleation
theory: as the supersaturation increases, the critical radius decreases.
This results in a higher nucleation rate since the size of stable
nuclei that grow on to become crystals is now smaller. The second
result explains the increase in the nucleation rate upon the addition
of SSS. In the presence of SSS surfaces, the surface free energy penalty
is lowered via a reduction of the crystal-melt area due to the SSS
surface. This results in an overall reduction in the activation free
energy as well as a decrease in the size of the critical nuclei, both
of which contribute to an increase in the nucleation rate.

Assuming that the lateral unit cell parameters22 of a similar triglyceride in the β′ polymorph
(2-oleodilaurin, LaOLa) can be applied to SOS, the number of molecules
in a cylindrical island of SOS can be estimated. The unit cell of
the β′-3 polymorph of 2-oleodilaurin (comprised of two
LaOLa molecules) has lateral dimensions of 5.450 Å × 7.736
Å with a cross-sectional area of 42.16 Å2. The
smallest critical nuclei (Shea Stearin 1 + 3% SSS at 23 °C) has
a cross-sectional area of 48.74 Å2. This area corresponds
approximately to the cross-sectional area of a single unit cell. Thus,
a critical nucleus in this scenario would contain approximately 2–4
SOS molecules. At the other extreme, the largest critical nuclei (Shea
Stearin 1 at 28 °C) would have a cross-sectional area of 296.05
Å2, which is equivalent to roughly five unit cells.
This would correspond to approximately 10–12 SOS molecules.

Materials and Methods
Atomic-Scale Molecular Dynamics
The simulations conducted
in this work are largely based on the methods of MacDougall and others,
who utilized atomic-scale molecular dynamics (ASMD) to examine the
ability of certain elaidic triglycerides to bind to SSS and trilaurin
(LLL) surfaces. This study was conducted with a view to examining
the oil binding ability of certain triglycerides on planar triglyceride
surfaces.23 The force field used in the
cited work was developed by Berger and others for modeling phospholipid
membranes.24

In the present work,
the binding of stearic acid triglycerides (SOS, OOS, OSS, and OSO)
to a planar crystalline TAG surface was studied with a view to elucidating
how oil binding to an SSS surface can possibly lead to heterogeneous
nucleation. The free and open-source molecule modeling package GROMACS
4.0 was used to conduct ASMD. The simulation workflow consisted of
three major steps:1. Energy minimization

2. Compression

3. Equilibration



A GROMACS trajectory file (*.gro) was first
constructed by constructing
an arbitrarily large simulation box and then populating it with the
particles/molecules to be studied. This involved populating 40 molecules
of the TAG to be studied in a milieu of triolein (OOO) particles at
a ratio of 1:4 TAG/OOO. The trajectory file contains information on
the positions and particle velocities of the molecules being studied.
The molecules are separated from other molecules by relatively large
distances to avoid overlap that may lead to spuriously high energies.
Since the bonding information is not stored in the .gro file, two
atoms may be introduced in a manner such that the position of the
atoms correspond to a high energy state—a stretched double
bond or two atoms overlapping in their repulsive shells. Such spuriously
high energy states may introduce artefacts. Energy minimization is
conducted on a trajectory file to impose the structural and energetic
constraints (the topology) found in the .top file on the simulated
particles. An energy minimization algorithm is then run to ensure
that the entire system achieves a minimum free energy state prior
to the actual “production run” simulation. A compression
run is then conducted to fix the parameters of the system prior to
the production run as well as to initialize the velocities of the
molecules being simulated. In this case, this involved compressing
the system to a fixed volume and temperature. In a compression run,
the dimensions of the simulation box are slowly “compressed”
to the final simulation box parameters. This is done slowly to avoid
spuriously high energies.

The final equilibration run is the
true production run that simulates
the phenomenon being studied. This run generates the trajectory files
used in the final analysis. ASMD works on the basis of numerically
integrating Newton’s laws of motion over a large number of
very “fine” time steps. In this work, the time step
used was 1 fs (10–15 s). The simulation was run
for 10 000 000 steps, corresponding to a total simulation
time of 10 ns. The simulation temperature was 52 °C or 325 K.
At this temperature, the studied triglycerides (in the physical world)
are in a molten state. A leapfrog integrator was used. A “heat
bath” in the form of velocity rescaling was used to control
temperature drift due to the imprecision introduced by dropping digits.

The simulation was carried out under the canonical NVT ensemble using GROMACS. The total energy U was
calculated for every 500 frames of the simulation and reported to
an .edr file. The Helmholtz free energy (applicable to an NVT ensemble) was calculated using the GROMACS utility g_energy_d.
The calculated free energies were averaged over the last 5, 4, 3,
2, and 1 ns of the simulation to ascertain the trend of the free energies.
By the time the simulation is half-completed, the free energies would
have settled to an equilibrium value. GROMACS calculates the Helmholtz
free energy ΔA against an ideal gas initial
state: 4  where k is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the system temperature and Upot is the potential energy term of the total
internal energy. The averaged free energy was divided by the total
number of molecules (N = 200) to calculate the free
energy per molecule.

To determine the binding of the studied
triglycerides to an SSS
surface, the free energy per molecule of systems with different distributions
of the studied triglyceride was studied. The triglyceride was modeled
in two types of configurations: layered and mixed. In the layered
configuration, the particles corresponding to the triglycerides were
all placed close to the SSS surface as a molecular layer during the
construction of the .gro file. This corresponds to a case where the
triglycerides are bound to the SSS surface. In the mixed case, the
triglycerides are dispersed throughout the simulation box, which represents
a case where the triglycerides are not bound to the SSS surface. The
free energy per molecule of the layered and mixed distributions was
calculated.

The free energy per molecule of a reference state
consisting only
of 200 triolein molecules was subtracted from the free energies of
the layered and mixed distributions. The difference in the free energy
per molecule between the studied state and the triolein reference
state was approximately 1–2 kJ/mol. The root-mean-square fluctuations
around the average were plotted as the error of the averages. In cases
where the error bars overlap, the chemical potentials of the two distributions
are not considered to be different with the conclusion being that
there are no free energy differences between the layered and mixed
states. Where the error bars do not overlap, the two states are considered
to have a free energy difference, which can be interpreted as a preference
for one configuration (i.e., layered or mixed) relative to the other.

Nucleation Kinetics
Experimental Materials
Experimental
work was conducted
to test the hypothesis generated by the simulations that the presence
of an SSS surface in a supersaturated melt will accelerate the nucleation
of SOS via heterogeneous nucleation.

The work utilizes a purified
shea stearin material dubbed Shea Stearin 1. Shea Stearin 1 was obtained
from unpurified shea stearin supplied by the Fuji Oil Company (Savannah,
GA). Purification was affected via a three-stage solvent fractionation
process. Acetone was used as the fractionating solvent. At each step,
the feedstock shea stearin was dissolved in acetone at mass ratios
of 1:4. The dissolved fat was held at the fractionation temperature
overnight to crystallize the SOS. Fractionation was initially conducted
at a temperature of 16 °C to concentrate the SOS in the crystalline
phase. The crystallized mass was then filtered and dried. Subsequent
purification of this material was conducted by repeating this process
at a temperature of 22 °C and then 25 °C. The latter two
steps removed lower-melting TAGs, which further increased the concentration
of SOS in the material.

The triglyceride composition (Table 4), in % w/w, of Shea
Stearin 1 was characterized using
isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Alliance
Model 2690 Separation Module, Waters Corporation, MA) utilizing a
C18 column (XBridge C18, 5 μm pore size, 4.6 × 250 mm2, Waters Corporation, MA) and a refractive index detector
(Waters model 2410 RID, Waters Corporation, MA). The fractionated
shea stearin was dissolved in 0.6 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of the
mobile phase (60:40 acetone/acetonitrile). The tristearin (SSS, >99%
purity) utilized in this work was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich.

Measurement of Nucleation
Rates Using Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
The steady-state nucleation rate JSS of a crystallizing fat system can be estimated experimentally
by measuring the induction time for the appearance of the first crystalline
material in a fat melt. The nucleation rate JSS can be formulated as the inverse of the induction time τ: 5  Traditionally, the induction
time is measured
using a phase transition analyzer (PTA), which utilizes a laser turbidometer
to detect the appearance of crystalline nuclei invisible to the naked
eye. The induction time is taken as the time at which the baseline
signal increases by an arbitrary percentage (usually 5–10%).
However, this method is not well-suited for the study of fractional
crystallization in fats, as is the case of SSS in cocoa butter or
SOS. This limitation is due to the inability of the PTA to resolve
the separate fractional crystallization events. As determined using
the PTA, the induction time will invariably be attributed to the crystallization
of the first component, which will be the SSS component in the mixture,
whereas interest in this study is in measuring the nucleation rate
of SOS, which crystallizes as the second later fraction.

To
distinguish between these separate crystallization events, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used. If the SSS is present at a high
enough concentration (≥1% SSS), the two triglyceride species
can usually be distinguished as two distinct peaks in the crystallization
exotherm with a smaller SSS peak crystallizing before SOS does, whereas
in the absence of SSS, only one peak is observed.

The induction
times of the various fats are measured using the
following time–temperature program:1. Heating at 30 °C/min to 80 °C.

2. Isothermal hold at 80 °C
for 5
min to ensure complete melting.

3. Cooling to a temperature of crystallization
using variable cooling rates to ensure that this cooling step is consistently
2 min for each of the various crystallization temperatures studied.

4. Isothermal hold at the
crystallization
temperature.

5. Heating
at 5 °C/min to 80 °C
to obtain the melting trace.



Fisher–Turnbull
Determination of the Activation Free
Energy of Nucleation
The Fisher–Turnbull model25 allows for the calculation of the activation
free energy of nucleation ΔGn given
estimates of the nucleation rate (as the inverse of the induction
time) at several different supersaturation/supercooling ΔT (Tf – T). The Fisher–Turnbull equation is an expression for the steady-state
nucleation rate JSS: 6  where N is the total number
of molecules of the un-nucleated parent phase, A is
the interfacial free energy per unit area and is calculated as the
interfacial free energy divided by the surface area of the nucleus, nc2/3 is the number of particles on
the surface of the critical nucleus, ΔGd is the activation Gibbs free energy associated with the diffusion
of a nucleating particle across the phase boundary and its deposition
onto the nucleating phase and ΔGc is the Gibbs free energy of nucleation. The term kBT/h is the vibration
frequency of the un-nucleated parent phase.

At temperatures
corresponding to low supersaturation (or low undercooling), the −ΔGd term is essentially constant and can be expressed
as the pre-exponential α: 7  At low supersaturation (or
low undercooling),
the dominant term that describes the rate of nucleation is therefore
the ΔGc term. However, at high supersaturation,
the ΔGd term (diffusion being a
thermally activated process) becomes significant and exerts a considerable
influence on the nucleation rate.

A plot of  will yield a straight
line with a slope
equivalent to: 8  where VM is the
molar volume of the solid phase (m3/mol), γs–l is the solid–liquid interfacial tension (J/m2), Tf is the melting point or temperature of fusion
(K), ΔHm is the molar enthalpy of
fusion (J/mol), ΔGc is the activation
free energy of nucleation (J), and ΔT is the
undercooling (K), equivalent to the difference between the melting
point Tf and the experimental temperature
of nucleation T, Tf – T.

Alternatively, a plot of , where τ is the induction time in
seconds, will also yield the same results. From the slope of the Fisher–Turnbull
plot, the activation free energy of nucleation ΔGc at various supercoolings can be calculated as follows: 9  With good calorimetric
data of the melting
point Tf and the melting enthalpy ΔHm as well as estimates of the molar volume VM, the liquid–solid interfacial free
energy per unit area γs–l can be calculated
according to the following calculation: 10  Performing this calculation
for materials
containing SSS would allow for the calculation of an “effective
system-wide” interfacial free energy per unit area which would
exhibit a reduction if heterogeneous nucleation were to occur. The
effective interfacial free energy per unit area is assumed to be a
weighted average of the interfacial free energy of homogeneous nucleation
and heterogeneous nucleation. As such, the extent of the decrease
in this effective interfacial energy is reflective of the prevalence
of heterogeneous nucleation.

Estimation of the Critical
Radius
With an estimate
of the interfacial energy, the size of the critical nuclei for heterogeneous
nucleation can be calculated according to the method presented by
Ramel and others.26 This model assumes
that TAG molecules nucleate on a surface as a cylindrical “island”
(Figure 1). The height
of this cylinder is equivalent to the lamellar height of the nucleating
species, which is the length of the molecular axis of the particular
polymorph the nucleating species crystallizes into. Using the model
provided, an expression for the critical radius of this cylindrical
island can be derived: 11  For the homogeneous nucleation of a cylinder
in the absence of a surface, the expression for the critical radius
is: 12  For this work, the values
used are given in Table 5.

of Nucleation Characteristics

Tf	34.76 ± 0.13 °C or 307.91 ± 0.13 K (n = 4)	
ΔHm	99.99 ± 2.49 J/g or 88.939 ± 2.214 kJ/mol (n = 4)

The melting
point Tf and melting enthalpy
ΔHm were obtained from the DSC melting
trace (scanned at 5 K/min) of the Shea Stearin 1 crystallized into
the β′ polymorph. The molar volume VM was calculated from density data of the β′
polymorph of SOS provided in the work by Arishima and others.27

The lamellar height h was calculated from the
(003) reflections of the powder X-ray spectra of Shea Stearin 1 crystallized
into the β′ polymorph. The X-ray spectra were obtained
using a Multiflex Powder XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with
a copper X-ray source (wavelength of 1.54 Å) operated at 40 kV
and 44 mA. The measurement scan rate was set at 0.1°/min between
the range 2θ = 1–30° at 20 °C. Peak positions
were determined using MDI Jade 9 (MDI, Livermore, CA) software. The
obtained value was found to be in agreement with literature values.28

Conclusions
The
hypothesis formulated using computer simulations was demonstrated
via nucleation kinetics studies of SOS and SSS mixtures. Differential
scanning calorimetry showed that the addition of SSS to SOS preparations
resulted in an increased nucleation rate of the bulk of the SOS. Higher
amounts of added SSS led to greater reductions in the induction time,
which can be interpreted as an increase in the amount of surface on
which heterogeneous nucleation may occur. Estimation of the surface
free energy showed that the surface free energy was reduced via the
addition of SSS, which supports the hypothesis of the heterogeneous
nucleation of SOS. The reduction of the surface free energy in heterogeneous
nucleation also led to a decrease in the activation free energy and
consequently, the critical nuclei radius. These would contribute to
the increase in the nucleation rate.

The heterogeneous nucleation
of SOS in the presence of SSS has
significant implications for the processing and crystallization of
fats in confectionery products. For example, it is commonly known
that the activation free energy of the α and β′
polymorphs is lower than that of the desired β (form V) polymorph.29 The presence of SSS and its promotion of heterogeneous
nucleation, which implies a lowered activation free energy, may have
an unintended effect on the nucleation of undesirable α and
β′ polymorphs during cocoa butter tempering. A lowered
activation free energy implies that a higher rate of nucleation can
be sustained with lower supersaturation. Bearing this in mind, the
presence of SSS crystals may promote the re-nucleation of these undesirable
polymorphs as the tempered cocoa butter mass is inevitably cooled
in the final stages of processing. Furthermore, the high melting point
of SSS will lend persistence to these effects since the SSS crystals
are not melted during the melting phase of the tempering procedure.
The impact of SSS crystals on the processing of chocolate is worth
further investigation.
