Triphenylamine-based
metal complexes were designed and synthesized via coordination to Ni(II),
Cu(II), and Zn(II) using their respective acetate salts as the starting
materials. The resulting metal complexes exhibit more negative energy
levels (vs vacuum) as compared to 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(Spiro-OMeTAD), high hole extraction efficiency, but low hole mobilities
and conductivities. Application of dopants typically used for Spiro-OMeTAD
was not successful, indicating a more complicated mechanism of partial
oxidation besides the redox potential. However, utilization as hole-transport
material was successful, giving a highest efficiency of 11.1% under
AM 1.5G solar illumination.

Introduction
In recent years, perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much
attention due to their easy fabrication1 and high conversion efficiencies.2 Perovskites
of this type are considered as the most promising materials3 to replace silicon solar cells in the market
due to their high carrier mobilities,4 long
charge diffusion length,5 high molar extinction
coefficient, and strong absorption over almost the whole visible spectrum.6 However, at the same time, there are still some
obstacles on the way toward commercialization, such as the toxic element
lead, the stability of the solar cells, and the inclusion of the expensive
hole-transport material (HTM) 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(Spiro-OMeTAD). To avoid using lead in perovskite solar cells, Snaith
and co-workers reported the CH3NH3SnI37 perovskite with an efficiency of 6.4%
in 2014. Other structures, like CsSnI38 and (CH3NH3)3(Bi2I9),9 have also been studied
and considered as potential lead-free light-absorbing materials. In
the ambition to increase the stability of the solar cells, the traditional
perovskite compound (CH3NH3PbI3)
was modified to a mixed perovskite ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15)10 or (FAI)0.81(PbI2)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.1511 representing
one strategy. Other methods, such as passivation of the perovskite
film,12,13 addition of hydrophobic interlayers,14 and encapsulation by polymers,15 have all been investigated. Also, much effort has been
devoted to replacing the expensive Spiro-OMeTAD material. A previous
report on the material X60 displays similar structure and comparable
solar cell efficiency as cells containing Spiro-OMeTAD but a much
simpler synthetic route, indicating a cost as low as U.S. $1/g. In
comparison, the estimated corresponding Spiro-OMeTAD costs amount
to more than U.S. $33/g.16

Metal
complexes have shown applications in solar cells for many
years. In the beginning, ruthenium(II) complexes were used as photosensitizers,
like N3 and N719,17−19 in dye-sensitized solar cells, being the basis for
solar cells with very impressive performance. Later, cobalt20 and copper complexes21 were used as redox couples to replace the traditional I–/I3– system due to their tunable redox
potentials and long-term stability. In recent years, metal complexes
have also been used as hole-transport materials and dopants in perovskite
solar cells, such as silver complexes,22 porphyrin,23 FK209,24 and copper complexes.25,26 However, the
metal complexes reported as hole-transport materials have their limitations
and cannot be widely up-scaled. In the silver system,22 the compound used is a silver complex cation with TFSI– as an anion offering a significant increase in conductivity,
but the strategy was considered as doping. In the copper system,26 the structure of the solar cell was sandwich
type, and by partial evaporation of the electrolyte, they could generate
the so-called “Zombie” cells, which do not correspond
to the traditional solid-state solar cells. Hence, we believe that
it is meaningful to explore how a traditional metal complex works
as a hole-transport material in an all solid-state solar cell.

In this report, we use perovskite as our photosensitizer in all
solid-state solar cell. At the same time, we designed and synthesized
three different metal complexes with triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives
as ligands coordinating to nickel, copper, and zinc, respectively.
The aim is to investigate the performance of traditional metal complexes
as HTMs and the influence from different metal ion centers on the
resulting energy levels, conductivities, hole mobilities, and possible
applications of these materials in perovskite solar cells. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first example that studies the
effects from different coordinated metals as hole-transport materials
in perovskite solar cells. Also, the first example when a nickel and
a zinc complex have been investigated in combination with Spiro-OMeTAD.

Results
and Discussion
The electron distribution of the highest occupied
molecular orbitals
(HOMOs) with HOMO-1s and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
(LUMOs) of the HTM molecules are shown in Figure 1. The HOMOs of these HTM molecules are mainly
localized on the ligands. For Y1, the electron clouds are delocalized
on both ligands, whereas in Y2 and Y3, the electron cloud is localized
on predominantly one of the ligands, indicating that transport properties
for holes may be different from that of Y1. All of the HOMO-1s have
almost the same energy as HOMOs, but with electrons localized on the
other ligand. Very little difference in energy between the HOMO and
HOMO-1 confirms that the highest occupied MOs essentially are placed
on the ligands. The LUMOs are all typically localized on the central
metal atoms and adjacent pyrrole rings, and relative poor transport
properties for electrons could be implied.

Figure 1 Frontier orbitals of
Y1, Y2, and Y3.

The redox potentials
(Eox) of Y1, Y2,
Y3, and Spiro-OMeTAD were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV)
in dichloromethane (DCM) solution (Figure 2a), collected with the corresponding data
of energy levels versus vacuum from the calculations in Table 1. The HOMO energy level of Y1
is −5.43 eV (vacuum energy scale), which is a bit more negative
than those of Y2 and Y3, both with an energy level of −5.38
eV, indicating that change in metal cores has only a slight effect
on the redox potentials. This is in accordance with the theoretical
calculations, which show that the electron density are mainly located
in the peripheral parts of the ligands. Thus, it is the redox properties
of the ligand that dominate the HOMO energy levels in these complexes
and not the metal cores. It is worth mentioning that the redox peaks
of Y1, Y2, and Y3 in the CV are irreversible, probably because of
a demetallization process upon oxidation.27,28 The redox potential of Spiro-OMeTAD was determined to be −5.12
eV under the same condition, this is in good agreement with the previous
report.29

Figure 2b shows
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the different metal complexes
in chloroform solution with normalized intensity. It is obvious that
the complexes display similar absorption properties, which show a
strong red shift as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD. However, as the metal
center is changed from nickel to zinc, the maximum absorption band
from d–d transition slightly shifts to shorter wavelengths,
indicating an increase in the band gap of the corresponding solid
material. The low intensity of π–π* and n−π*
transition in Y2 and Y3 can be noted at shorter wavelengths.30 The decrease or disappearance of the peak in
Y3 due to n−π* transition confirms the coordination through
N atom in the pyrrole ring. The π–π* transition
with a shoulder at 299 nm, as well as a new peak at 277 nm, in Y1
and Y2 is caused by the complex formation. The band gap and LUMO energy
levels, as well as the calculated energy levels of the HOMOs, HOMO-1s,
and LUMOs, are listed in Table 1.

According to the HOMO energy levels in Table 1, all of the systems show more
negative energy
levels than Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV). Even if the three compounds
in principle should be able to oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD, no such reactions
could be verified. Results are shown in Figure S9. It seems likely that the mechanism of oxidation is more
complicated than just depending on the redox potential of Y1, Y2,
and Y3.

The HOMO energy levels are promising with respect to
the function
as hole-transport materials in PSCs. First, we studied the hole-transfer
properties at the perovskite–HTM interface using steady-state
photoluminescence (PL) on a device with the structure of fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/perovskite/HTM. The results are shown
in Figure 3. Devices
with a naked perovskite film show a high light emission intensity
due to the radiative recombination between photogenerated electrons
and holes. When coating with HTMs, a significant decrease in the emission
signals was observed for all of the materials. The PL quenching efficiencies
for Y1, Y2, and Y3 are quite high and similar, most likely relating
to their comparable HOMO energy levels and the corresponding driving
force, indicating highly efficient hole transfer yields between the
perovskite films and the HTMs, all above 90% and at the same level
as Spiro-OMeTAD.

Y2, Y3, or Spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transport material.

The reorganization energy is a key factor affecting
the charge-transfer
rate. It represents the structural relaxation upon the removal or
addition of an electron to the system. Usually, molecular structures
showing a smaller reorganization energy will also exhibit faster transfer
rates for electrons or holes. As indicated in Table 2, Y2 shows the lowest calculated reorganization
energy of 149 meV, which is comparable to 147 meV for Spiro-OMeTAD.
However, compared with Y1 and Y3, the difference is minor; we should
not expect a big difference in the carrier-transport ability among
these materials.

Because it is always
important to confirm the theoretical calculations
from the experiment, we also studied their hole mobilities via the
space-charge-limited currents method,31 see eq 1. Moreover,
conductivities were determined using a two-contact electrical setup
following a previously reported procedure,32,33 see eq 2. The results
are shown in Figure 4. 1  where J is the current density,
μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity
(8.85 × 10–12 F m–1), εr is the dielectric constant of the material (normally approximated
to 3 for organic semiconductors), V is the applied
bias voltage, and d is the film thickness. 2  where σ
is the conductivity, L is the channel length (about
2 mm), μ is the channel
width (about 10 mm), d is the film thickness (around
400 nm), R is the film resistance calculated from
the gradients of the curves, and defined as the reciprocal of the
slope, which is estimated from a least-squares fit of a linear model
to the current–voltage data.

of thin films in hole-conducting-only devices without doping. (b)
Current–voltage characteristics of different HTM films with
same amount doping as for the solar cells.

As shown in Figure 4a, pristine hole mobilities are quite low. All are around 2 ×
10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, as listed in Table 3. The differences are probably within the experimental
errors. The mobilities are lower than that of pristine Spiro-OMeTAD,
which is about 1.69 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1. This is in good agreement
with the small differences in calculated reorganization energies.
Also, the new materials show lower conductivities as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD.
For Y3, the conductivity is 4.05 × 10–7 S cm–1. Y1 and Y2 are expected to display better carrier-transport
properties. However, they are about the same as for Y3, approximately
4.06 × 10–7 and 3.66 × 10–7 S cm–1, respectively. Note that the values here
are similar with the conductivity of the ligand (4) itself, which
is 4.87 × 10–7 S cm–1 (Figure S10), showing that coordination does not
have a positive effect on the increasing conductivities. Considering
the small difference among Y1, Y2, and Y3, we believe that it is related
to the structure of the metal complex itself. The designed molecular
materials have very limited conjugated structures because the metal
in the center breaks the whole molecule into two separate entities.
Previous reports on pure organic molecules as HTMs34 have mentioned this effect, which emphasizes the importance
of a large conjugated system. It realistic to assume that this also
can be extended to metal complexes. On the other hand, it could also
originate from the electron density distribution in the ground state.
According to the Bässler model,35 the inherent dipolarity of a molecule has an adverse effect on the
charge-carrier transport. In our systems, the HOMO electrons are localized
on the ligands, which gives the ligands a negative charge and the
central metal a positive charge. This charge separation causes a dipolarity
in all of the metal complexes because the single electron pair in
N in the triphenylamine unit could then easily transfer to N in the
pyrrole ring, as shown in Figure 5.

state.

Further, these materials were investigated
as hole-transport materials
in the perovskite solar cells. By decreasing the film thickness (lower
to 50 nm), we could compensate for the disadvantage of low bulk charge
transport properties. All three materials offered PSCs with voltages
higher than 1 V, whereas a voltage of only 0.52 V could be obtained
for solar cells without applied HTMs (Figure S11). However, the main problem of the new HTMs is still the low conductivity.
As seen in Figure 6a, Y2 and Y3 do not significantly improve the photocurrent, showing
11.01 and 12.62 mA cm–2, respectively. Thus, a poorer
overall performance of 6.0 and 7.1% was obtained as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD
(17.3%). Surprisingly, the best efficiency was obtained from the devices
based on Y1, which offer a current density of 16.57 mA cm–2, a voltage of 1.06 V, and a fill factor of 0.63 to yield an efficiency
of 11.1%. The hysteresis phenomenon was also investigated and is shown
in Figure 6a. All Y1,
Y2, and Y3 display a high hysteresis with lower fill factor, indicating
that metal complex hole-transport materials have minor effect on reducing
the hysteresis. Corresponding data are summarized in Table 4. Distribution of 20 devices
based on Y1, Y2, and Y3 as hole-transport materials in the perovskite
solar cells are summarized in Figure S12, and a good reproducibility could be observed.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) spectra
of PSCs with Y1, Y2, Y3, or Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transport material
are shown in Figure 6b. The results clearly show that devices with Y1 have the highest
IPCE compared with Y2 and Y3, although it is still lower than that
of Spiro-OMeTAD. This is in good agreement with the J–V measurement, in which Y1 shows the highest
current of 16.57 mA cm–2 among the three metal complexes.
The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE
spectra are 16.31, 10.65, 12.47, and 20.85 mA cm–2 for Y1, Y2, Y3, and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, matching the J–V test results quite well.

On the basis of the photovoltaic performance shown in Table 4, all of the new materials
work as hole scavengers and transport materials, but none is as good
as Spiro-OMeTAD. The reason is mainly the low conductivities, as well
as the low hole mobility, which hinder the charge-carrier transport.
This limitation is also emphasized by an increase in the HTM layer
thickness. Due to the low conductivity, an increase in layer thickness
will result in a higher transport resistance, decreasing the current
density and fill factor dramatically, as shown in Figure S13.

However, the film thickness can only be
decreased to a certain
thickness to compensate for this drawback. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images in Figure 7 show the film-forming properties of the different materials. Obviously,
when using HTM concentration as low as 10 mg mL–1, the perovskite surface does not become well covered. Further decrease
in thickness will cause an increase in the recombination losses because
of uncovered perovskite coming in contact with the gold counter electrode
material. Comparing the covered perovskite films by the metal complex
materials when the same HTM concentration of the spin-coating solution
was used, Y1 forms a much better film than Y2 and Y3. Figure 7e,f indicates that aggregation
is a serious problem for the Y2 and Y3 systems. A large area with
noncovered perovskite will allow direct contact with the gold counter
electrode material, resulting in higher recombination losses and thus
a smaller shunt resistance (Rsh) decreasing
both the fill factor and the current as compared to Y1.

of a perovskite solar cell when Spiro-OMeTAD is applied as the hole-transport
material, (d) the surface after coating with Y1, (e) the surface after
coating with Y2, and (f) the surface after coating with Y3.

Furthermore, we investigated the
impedance and capacitance using
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the solar cells based
on Y1, Y2, Y3, or Spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM to study the interface properties.
The results are shown in Figure 8. As expected, Y1 shows the lowest series resistance
(Rs), which is about 4 Ω, lower
than those of the devices based on Y2 and Y3, which are 9 and 7 Ω,
respectively. The lower series resistance is linked to a high PSC
photocurrent. In addition, we note that although PSCs based on metal
complexes show a lower recombination resistance (Rrec) than those with Spiro-OMeTAD, devices based on Y1
still show the highest Rrec among the
three complexes, in good agreement with the photovoltaic performance
in Figure 6a. We believe
that this is because of the better film-forming ability of Y1 on the
perovskite surface, preventing shunts between the perovskite and counter
electrode materials. This effect is also indicated by the capacitances
shown in Figure 8b.
Devices based on Y1 display the lowest capacitance at low frequencies,
whereas devices based on Y2 and Y3 show lower capacitances in the
high-frequency region (>105 Hz). This is because at
low
frequency a better film of Y1 could efficiently extract and transport
the holes. Thus, a lower capacitance could be achieved compared with
Y2 and Y3. However, in the high-frequency region, the perovskite–HTM
interface for devices based on Y1 experience a higher charge accumulation
due to faster and better extraction ability, but a low carrier-transport
ability. The excess of holes on the interface may result in a higher
capacitance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully designed and synthesized three
metal complexes with TPA derivative ligands coordinated to nickel,
copper, and zinc. These materials show very similar HOMO energy levels
but an increase in band gaps going from nickel to copper to zinc.
Also, these materials show high hole-extraction efficiencies but low
hole mobilities and conductivities, resulting in satisfactory, but
not excellent, PSC performance when applied as hole-transport materials.
The best device performance was observed for the material based on
nickel, with a conversion efficiency of 11.1%. This can most likely
be ascribed the better film-forming ability on the perovskite surface.
Application as dopants for Spiro-OMeTAD was not successful in spite
of the more negative HOMO energy levels (vs vacuum). The current results
will act as a guideline when exploring metal complexes as the hole-transport
materials.

DFT Calculations
To elucidate the electronic properties
of Y1, Y2, and Y3, optimization and single-point energy calculations
were performed using the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31G* basis
sets for the C, H, N, and O atoms, without any symmetry constraints.
All of the reported calculations were carried out by means of Gaussian
09. The LAN L2DZ effective core potential basis sets were used for
the Cu, Zn, and Ni atoms.

Hole Mobility Measurements
Hole
mobilities were estimated
according to literature.31,36 Briefly, a hole-conducting-only
device with the structure of FTO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/Au was fabricated. The fluorine-doped tin
oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (Pilkington TEC15) were etched
with Zn powder and 2 M HCl solution. The substrates were then washed
with soap, acetone, and alcohol by sonication for 30 min. The remaining
organic residues were removed using a plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma)
for 30 min. A 40 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm
on the substrate, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 20 min.
A 10 mg mL–1 HTM solution in chloroform was spin-coated
on top of the annealed PEDOT:PSS layer, followed by evaporation of
an 80 nm thick gold film as the counter electrode. The J–V characteristics of the devices were recorded
with a Keithley 2400 Semiconductor Characterization System.

Conductivity
Measurements
Conductivities were determined
according to previous reports.32,33 Glass substrates without
a conductive layer were carefully washed with soap, acetone, and alcohol
by sonication for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited
by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s using a solution of 30 nm TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 30NR-T) in absolute EtOH (w/w = 1/3). After
spin-coating, the substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate at
80 °C for 15 min and then transferred to an oven and sintered
at 500 °C for 30 min. A 10 mg mL–1 HTM solution
in chloroform was subsequently spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 layer, followed by evaporation of an 80 nm gold film as the
counter electrode. The J–V characteristics were recorded in dark conditions with a Keithley
2400 Semiconductor Characterization System.

Fabrication of solar cells
FTO glass substrates (14
Ω sq–1, Pilkington TEC) were cut into 12.5
cm × 3 cm pieces. These pieces were then etched with Zn powder/2
M HCl solution in the middle. After etching, all of the residuals
on the glass were removed and washed with soap, acetone, and alcohol
by sonication for 30 min. The clean glass substrates were stored without
further treatment.

A compact TiO2 layer was made
by using a spray pyrolysis with a 0.2 M solution of titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide
and 2 M acetylacetone in isopropyl alcohol at 450 °C. Cooling
to room temperature, the 12.5 cm × 3 cm glass substrates were
further cut into 2.5 cm × 1.5 cm pieces. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was made by spin-coating at 4500 rpm for 30 s using
a solution of 30 nm TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 30NR-T) in absolute
EtOH (w/w = 1/5.5). After spin-coating, the substrate was immediately
placed on a hotplate at 80 °C for 15 min and then transferred
to an oven and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.

A (FA)0.85(MA)0.15Pb(I3)0.85(Br3)0.15 perovskite film was made by spin-coating
at 4500 rpm for 30 s inside an argon glovebox with a precursor solution
containing 1.1 M PbI2, 1 M FAI, 0.2 M PbBr2,
and 0.2 M MABr in a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1). During spin-coating,
125 μL chlorobenzene was sprayed onto the film after 15 s. After
finishing, the substrates were immediately placed on a hotplate at
100 °C for 30 min.

Hole-transport materials were spin-coated
at 4000 rpm for 30 s
using different precursor solutions. For Spiro-OMeTAD, the solution
contained 70 mM Spiro-OMeTAD, 20 mM LiTFSI, 200 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 2 mM FK209 in chlorobenzene.
For materials Y1, Y2, and Y3, the concentration used were 10 mg mL–1, with 10 mM LiTFSI, 100 mM TBP, and 4% volume 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
(TeCA)37 as dopant (Figure S8). All of the solutions were prepared inside an argon-filled
glovebox but spin-coated outside the glovebox.

The final step
to fabricate a perovskite solar cell was the evaporation
of a gold film as the counter electrode. A layer of 80 nm Au was deposited
sequentially under high vacuum (<5 × 10–5 Pa) by thermal evaporation (Edwards Auto 306) through a shadow mask
to form an active area of around 20 mm2.

Characterization
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra were collected
with a Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer
instrument (Varian 7.0TFTICR-MS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed
in dichloromethane with 0.1 M (TBA)PF6 as the supporting
electrolyte, a Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the reference, a carbon-glass
electrode as the working electrode, a Pt electrode as the counter
electrode, and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal
reference using a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation (model
660 A). The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda
750 spectrophotometer using a 1 cm cuvette. The concentration of the
initial solution used was 10–5 M. The steady-state
photoluminescence (PL) was investigated using a CARY Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a FEI-XL 30 series
microscope. Film thickness was determined using a profilometer of
model Veeco Dektak 150. The light source for the photocurrent–voltage
(J–V) measurements was an
AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport 91160-1000). The incident light intensity
was 100 mW cm–2 calibrated using a certified Si-photodiode
(Fraunhofer ISE). The size of the working electrode was 25 ×
3 mm2 on a substrate shared by four solar cells, and the
counter electrode was 10 × 4 mm2. The solar cells
investigated were masked to a working area of 0.126 cm2. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained by the linear sweep voltammetry
method using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit with a scan rate
10 mV s–1. IPCE spectra were recorded on a computer-controlled
setup with a light source ASB-XE-175, a monochromator (Spectral Products
CM110), and a Keithley multimeter (model 2700). The setup was calibrated
with a certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and capacitance measurements were carried
out using an Autolab PGstat12 potentiostat with an impedance module
under a single sine function in dark with an applied bias potential
of −1 V. The frequency range used was 0.1–100 000
Hz, together with an oscillating amplitude of 10 mV.
