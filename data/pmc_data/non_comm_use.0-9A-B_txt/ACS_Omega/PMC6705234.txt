Silver nanowires
(Ag NWs) as transparent conducting electrodes
are widely used in many applications such as organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs), polymer light-emitting diodes, touch screens, solar
cells, and transparent heaters. In this work, using a large-scale
synthesis, the synthesized Ag NWs had a high aspect ratio of 2820.
The Ag NWs could be applied as a top transparent electrode in a device
by simple drop-casting without any post-processing steps. The fabricated
device comprised 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl/MoO3 organic/inorganic layers which are parts of the inverted structure
OLEDs or solar cells. The photodiode characteristics at the UV range
were observed in the device. The ability of Ag NWs to replace opaque
metals as top electrodes in a device has been demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles
and nanowires (NWs) are highly attractive materials
in the field of electronic devices as well as other fields.1−15 In a typical optoelectronic device structure, the bottom electrode
is often a transparent conducting electrode, while the top electrode
is normally a metal thin film.16−24 The device performance is hence limited as light is not transmitted
through the top electrode which is opaque. The device performances
can be enhanced by using a transparent metal conducting material as
the top electrode. Among transparent metal conducting materials available,
silver NWs (Ag NWs) are widely used as transparent conducting bottom
electrodes because of their highest electrical conductivity and ease
in synthesizing1,25−34 Ag NWs have been reported to be used in many applications such as
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), polymer LEDs, touch screens,
solar cells, and transparent heaters.18−26,34 This is because Ag NW electrodes
are exceptional in terms of transparency, conductivity, and flexibility
and suitable to be applied in optoelectronic devices.23,25,26,28,29 Besides that, the processing of Ag NW electrodes
is cost-effective because Ag NWs can be processed in solution.22,27,32,33,35

Several studies have reported the
application of Ag NWs as top
electrodes but their Ag NWs mostly consist of a polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) layer.35−40 Typically, post-processing procedures such as high temperature annealing,
chemical annealing, light annealing, and tedious purification processes
are required to remove the PVP layer in order to improve the conductivity
and connectivity of the Ag NW network.41,42 The Ag NWs
without PVP as capping agent are thus attractive as the complicated
post-processing can be eliminated. Generally, when Ag NWs are applied
as top electrodes, the choice of the post-processing process is often
limited to annealing by heat treatment. Hence, the application of
Ag NWs without the need of post-processing is desirable especially
for the devices that contain heat-sensitive layers, where the post-processing
temperature is critical.

The present work aims to explore the
applicability of high aspect
ratio and post-processing free Ag NWs as top electrodes for device
application. We first synthesized Ag NWs with a high aspect ratio
of 2820. The synthesized Ag NWs are then applied as a top electrode
in an inverted structure photodiode by simple drop-casting at room
temperature without the need for annealing after deposition. In this
work, the organic/inorganic photodiode with 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl
(CBP)/MoO3 layers is fabricated. This is because CBP/MoO3 is widely used as hole-injection and hole-transport layers
in inverted structure LEDs or solar cells.16,17 After the fabrication of the CBP/MoO3 photodiode with
Ag NWs as the top electrode, the device performances are analyzed
to investigate the potential of Ag NWs as top electrodes for inverted
structure optoelectronic devices. The capability of Ag NWs as a transparent
conducting top electrode is important for making double-sided, transparent
flexible devices.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure and Morphology of Synthesized
Ag NWs
Ag NWs were synthesized at various Fe3+ concentrations (Figures S1 and S2). The
aspect ratios of Ag NWs synthesized with 40, 80, and 120 mM Fe3+ are 490, 1156, and 236, respectively, as summarized in Table 1. The optimal concentration
of Fe3+ for obtaining the highest aspect ratio is found
to be 80 mM. To investigate the feasibility of scaling up the synthesis,
the synthesis was scaled-up by 10 times (namely, large scale) with
using 80 mM Fe3+ as the catalyst. The synthesized Ag NWs
in large-scaled synthesis has an aspect ratio of 2820. We found that
in large-scale synthesis, the AgCl seeds were bigger than those in
small-scale synthesis (Figure S3 and Table S1). Hence, the number of seeds becomes
smaller in large-scale synthesis, causing Ag NWs to grow longer than
in small-scale synthesis.

High aspect-ratio NWs are desirable as transparent conducting electrodes
since percolation of the NW network can be achieved with low density
of NWs.23,26,28,29 Since the Ag NWs produced in the large scale synthesis
is found to have the highest aspect ratio, and large amount of NWs
can be obtained in a single synthesis, these Ag NWs were used to fabricate
the top electrode for the photodiode. Figure 1a,b shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the synthesized
Ag NWs after purification, respectively. The average length of Ag
NWs was 110 μm and the average diameter was 40 nm. The dispersion
of Ag NWs in isopropanol (IPA) with a concentration of 9.76 mg/mL
is shown in Figure 1c. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data in Figure 1d show that the synthesized NWs had peaks
in 2θ equal to 38.12° and 44.28°, identical with that
in the reference pattern of Ag. The UV–vis spectrum (Figure 1e) of NWs dispersed
in IPA shows the peaks at 384 and 353 nm, where the former corresponds to the localized surface
plasmon resonance of Ag NWs in transverse mode.

2.2 Conductivity and Transparency of the Ag NW
Electrode
The Ag NW electrode was prepared by depositing
Ag NWs onto a cleaned glass substrate. The Ag NW electrode has an
average sheet resistance of 58 Ω/sq which is suitable to be
used as a transparent conducting electrode. Figure 2 shows the transmission spectra of the fabricated
Ag NW electrode and a commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.
The transparency of the Ag NW electrode is around 76% at the visible
light range, which is lower than that of ITO (around 83% transparency).
Even though the transparency of Ag NWs is lower than that of ITO in
the visible light region, the application of Ag NWs as the top electrode
in our device is feasible. In UV wavelengths (320–380 nm),
the Ag NW electrode has approximately 68.2% transparency, which is
comparable to ITO (67.8% transparency) that is used as the bottom
electrode. The transparency of the Ag NW electrode in the UV region
is important because the active layers of our photodiode consist of
CBP and MoO3 layers, which are responsive to UV wavelengths
(Figure S4).

spectra of the Ag NW electrode and of
the ITO one. The black arrow shows the transmissions of the Ag NW
electrode and ITO electrode at a wavelength of 340 nm.

2.3 Application of Ag NWs as the Top Transparent
Electrode in the Inverted Structure Photodiode
Since the
synthesized Ag NWs display good sheet resistance and optical transparency
as the transparent conductive electrode, we hence applied the Ag NWs
into a photodiode as the top electrode. The organic/inorganic photodiode
in our study consists of ITO as the bottom electrode, CBP/MoO3 as the active layers and Ag NWs as the top electrode, as
shown in the Figure 3a. The energy band diagram of the device using Ag NWs as the top
electrode is shown in Figure 3b wherein the energy value of the MoO3 layer is
the measured value for MoO3 in our previous study.17Figure 3c shows the actual device under measurement with Ag NWs as
the top electrode under UV irradiation. The Ag NW top electrode has
well-contacted and connected NW networks that comprise of several
layers of NWs, as shown in Figure 3d.

directions of photogenerated electrons and holes across the device,
(c) photo of the real device under UV light illumination with the
inset showing the device on a paper under room light, and (d) SEM
image of Ag NWs as the top electrode in the device. The work functions
for ITO, CBP, MoO3, and Ag NWs in the device are obtained
based on references.17,43

The measurements to obtain
photodiode characteristics were carried
out by connecting the crocodile clips of the electrometer Keithley
2425, to Al wires which were connected to the electrodes of the photodiode
via a silver paste. A xenon light source with band-pass filters of
254 ± 5, 270 ± 5, 310 ± 5, 340 ± 5, 365 ±
5, 380 ± 5, and 410 ± 5 nm was used. Since Ag NWs provide
transparency for the light source to pass through as discussed in
the previous section, the measurements were obtained by illuminating
the device from the Ag NW side. Figure 4a shows the responsivity of the CBP/MoO3 photodiode using Ag NWs as the top electrode. The device shows the
highest responsivity at wavelengths of 340 and 365 nm and lower responsivity
at wavelengths of 254, 270, 310, and 380 nm. Since the absorbance
peaks of CBP and MoO3 are in the range between 340 and
370 nm (Figure S4), the peak wavelengths
of the responsivity curve suggest that excitons might be formed at
both CBP and MoO3 layers upon illumination. As expected,
the device does not show responsivity at 410 nm, which falls within
the visible light range. To examine the other properties of the device,
the UV light source was fixed at 340 nm that resulted in the highest
responsivity.

Figure 4 (a) Responsivity versus wavelength, (b) I–V curve, (c) photocurrent vs optical power,
and (d) on/off
switching curves (under zero-bias conditions) of CBP/MoO3 photodiodes using Ag NWs as the top electrode and ITO as the bottom
electrode.

The I–V characteristics
in the UV range using Ag NWs as the top electrode are shown in Figure 4b. The dark current
measured is 1 nA at biases of 0.4 and −0.4 V. The dark and
the photocurrent I–V curves
show symmetric and linear behaviors. At a bias of −0.4 V, the
photocurrent is −1.5 nA for 1.2 mW incident power, which represents
a photocurrent to dark current ratio of 1.5. The symmetry of the I–V curves might be due to the very
less work-function difference between ITO (∼4.8 eV) and Ag
NWs (∼4.6 eV) and the energy levels of the CBP and MoO3 layers. The dark and illuminated I–V curves for the region near 0 V demonstrate the presence
of a photovoltaic effect under illumination at 340 nm light. The maximum
short-circuit current is −1.5 nA for an incident power of 1.2
mW. The open-circuit voltage is 0.4 V. To prove that the effect is
not due to hysteresis, voltage was scanned from both directions (forward
bias to reverse bias and vice versa) and the corresponding current
was measured. The direction of scan has negligible effect on the photovoltaic
response. This photovoltaic response, which allows separation of an
electron–hole pair at zero applied bias is the indication for
a type II heterostructure between the MoO3 and CBP layers,
where the built-in field in the device under zero bias is sufficient
to promote charge separation.

Figure 4c shows
the relationship of photocurrent with the optical power of the light
source. The current is negligible under dark conditions. When the
optical power increases, the light intensity increases and hence the
photocurrent also increases. It is clear that the photocurrent does
not increase linearly with incident power. In the low power region,
the response is quite linear, suggesting that during recombination,
the rates of the absorbed photon and photo-generated electron–hole
pairs in reaching the electrodes are constant. Above ∼0.2 mW,
the photocurrent increase is slower with increased power (increased
intensity). The slower increment of photocurrent in the high intensity
region may be due to the saturation of electron traps. To investigate
the switching behaviors of Ag NWs as the top electrode with ITO as
the bottom electrode of the photodiode, the device was illuminated
from both Ag NW and ITO sides. The device shows a good on/off switching
behavior as shown in Figure 4d, upon illumination from both Ag NW and ITO sides. The slight
difference in the photocurrents observed for the top (Ag NW side)
and bottom (ITO side) may be due to the absorbance of Ag NWs. Based
on the UV–vis spectra (Figure S4), the device with ITO/CBP/MoO3/Ag NWs layers shows slightly
higher absorbance at 340 nm than the device with ITO/CBP/MoO3 layers, suggesting that some UV light is absorbed by the Ag NW electrode
before reaching the CBP/MoO3 layers. However, overall UV
light is mainly absorbed by the CBP/MoO3 layers.

Silver
nitrate (AgNO3, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylene glycol (EG, Wako),
1,2-dodecanediol
(DD, TCI), sodium chloride (NaCl, Wako), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
[Fe(NO3)3, Wako], ammonia solution (28% NH4OH, Wako), acetic acid (AcOH, Wako), IPA (Wako), CBP (Lumtec),
and molybdenum oxide (MoO3, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as
received.

3.2 Synthesis of High-Aspect Ratio Ag NWs
Ag NWs were synthesized based on the modified polyol method, as shown
in Figure 5, with the
reference to reports by Sim et al.44,45 First, 6.30
mL of EG was added into a flask and heated at 110 °C for 1 h
under magnetic stirring. Simultaneously, 80 mM Fe(NO3)3 solution and 30 mM NaCl solution were prepared. Then, AgNO3 solution was prepared in another vial by adding AgNO3 into 1.50 mL of EG. After 1 h of heating, 0.15 mL of Fe(NO3)3 solution and 0.03 mL of NaCl solution were injected
into the preheated EG sequentially and heated at 110 °C for another
20 min. The magnetic stirring was then removed from the solution,
followed by injection of 1.50 mL of AgNO3 solution. The
reaction was maintained at 110 °C for 15 h to allow the growth
of NWs. The reacted solution was subsequently quenched down to room
temperature and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min with DD, NH4OH, and AcOH consecutively. The purified Ag NWs were dispersed
in IPA for further characterization. The concentration of Fe3+ was varied from 40 to 120 mM to acquire the optimal concentration
for obtaining NWs with the highest aspect ratio. For the large scale
synthesis of Ag NWs, the concentration of AgNO3, NaCl and
Fe(NO3)3 were kept the same as small scale synthesis
(×1) but the volumes of the solutions were increased by 10 times.
Same procedures were carried out and the detailed parameters are summarized
in Table 2.

3.3 Fabrication of theAg NW Electrode and CBP/MoO3 Photodiode
Ag NWs were dispersed in IPA to form
1.22 mg/mL dispersion. To fabricate the Ag NW electrode, quartz glass
was used as the substrate. Before use, the glass substrate was cleaned
with nonionic detergent, distilled water (resistivity = 18.2 MΩ
cm–1), acetone, ethanol, and IPA sequentially under
sonication. The substrate was then dried and subjected to a VUV lamp
(Ushio Corp.) under a pressure of 10 Pa air for 30 min. Next, the
electrode was prepared by simple drop-casting of Ag NWs onto a glass
substrate and leaving it to dry for 15 min naturally. To fabricate
the photodiode, the commercial ITO-coated glass substrate with a resistivity
of 7–15 Ω/sq was used as the bottom electrode. First,
the ITO-coated substrate was etched to a narrow strip by using hydrochloric
acid and zinc dust. Then, the substrate was cleaned using the same
cleaning process as for the glass substrate. A layer of 60 nm thick
CBP was then deposited onto the ITO-coated substrate, followed by
deposition of an inorganic layer, MoO3 with 125 nm at vacuum
level 10–4 Pa by using a thermal evaporation method.
Ag NWs as the top electrode were drop-casted onto the MoO3 and dried naturally.

3.4 Characterization
The crystalline
and phase structures of Ag NWs were characterized using XRD (Rigaku
MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, λ =
1.5418 Å, scanning speed of 2° min–1).
The morphologies of the synthesized NWs were examined using SEM (JEOL-JSM-6701F
and Hitachi TM3030 Plus, 15 kV) and TEM(JEOL JEM-2000FX, 200 kV).
The average length of the NWs was measured based on 50 NWs and the
average diameter was measured based on 30 NWs in the SEM and TEM images.
The absorbance and transmission of Ag NWs, the electrode, and the
photodiode were characterized by using ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis, Shimadzu UV Spectrophotometer UV-1800
with UV Probe software and JASCO V-650). The average sheet resistivity
was obtained based on 10 measurements on the Ag NW electrode by using
a four-point probe method (Loresta-GP, MCP-T610, Mitsubishi Chemical
Analytech, Japan). A high-power Xenon lamp (300 W, Max-301, Asahi
Spectra Co., Ltd.) with band-pass filters of 254 ± 5, 270 ±
5, 310 ± 5, 340 ± 5, 365 ± 5, 380 ± 5, and 410
± 5 nm was used as the UV light source. The responsivity, photocurrent
as function of optical power, current–voltage (I–V) and switching characteristics data of
the photodiode were obtained with a Keithley 2425 electrometer connected
with a computer.

4 Conclusions
The
synthesis of Ag NWs with a high aspect ratio of 2820 is achievable
by using 80 mM Fe3+ as a catalyst and scaling up by 10
times. The sheet resistivity and transparency of the NW network are
suitable for using as a transparent conductive top electrode to replace
opaque metal electrodes. The Ag NWs can be deposited by simple drop-casting
into the photodiode device at room temperature and without any post
processing. The ability for the synthesis of Ag NWs to be scaled up,
the simplicity of deposition and the elimination of complicated post-processing
are beneficial for industrial production where large-scale production
and simple procedures are preferable. Our demonstration on using high-aspect
ratio Ag NWs as a top electrode in an inverted ITO/CBP/MoO3/Ag NW photodiode illustrates the potential of such Ag NWs to be
integrated as top electrodes in full inverted structure OLEDs or solar
cells in the future.
