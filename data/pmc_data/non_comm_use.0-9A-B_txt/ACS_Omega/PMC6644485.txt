To achieve insulating materials with
a low-dielectric characteristic
for high-frequency communication applications, three phosphinated
poly(aryl ether)s: P1-act (with acetic moiety), P1-mma (with phenyl
methacrylic moiety), and P1-vbe (with vinylbenzyl ether moiety) were
modified from a phenol-functionalized phosphinated poly(aryl ether)
(P1). P1-act and P1-mma, both with active ester linkages (Ph–O–(C=O)−),
were reacted with three commercial epoxy resins (diglycidyl ether
of bisphenol A, HP7200, and cresol novolac epoxy) to obtain secondary
hydroxyl-free epoxy thermosets. Because of the secondary hydroxyl-free
structure, epoxy thermosets cured by P1-act and P1-mma show an 11–15%
reduction in dielectric constant than those cured by P1. P1-vbe, with
reactive vinylbenzyl ether moieties, was self-cured to a high-performance
thermoset with a Tg value as high as 302
°C and a dielectric constant as low as 2.64U. High-Tg and low-dielectric thermosets
have been developed in this work.

==== Body
Introduction
Epoxy resins are widely
used in the electronic field such as encapsulation
and printed circuit boards (PCBs) because of their good chemical resistance,
adhesion, insulation, and dimensional stability after thermally curing.
It is known that the propagating speed in an integrated circuit is
inversely proportional to the square root of dielectric constant (Dk); the dielectric loss (L)
is proportional to the product of square root of frequency, dielectric
constant (Dk1/2), and dissipation
factor (Df).1 Therefore, a material with a low dielectric value will exhibit a
high signal propagating speed and a low signal propagating loss. Generally,
epoxy resins are cured by reacting the epoxy groups with active hydrogen-containing
compounds such as phenol novolac, diamine, or thiol.2−16 The reaction of active hydrogens with epoxy leads to secondary alcohol
linkages, which are highly polar and increase the dielectric constant
of epoxy thermosets. Therefore, compared with other low-dielectric
thermosets,1 epoxy thermosets show a moderate-to-high
dielectric constant.

Using active ester-type epoxy curing agents
(curing agent with
Ph–O–(C=O)– structure) is a solution to
prepare secondary alcohol-free epoxy thermosets. Nishikubo et al.
studied thermo-cross-linking reactions of active esters with epoxy-containing
polymers.17−24 The resulting epoxy thermosets show better dielectric properties
than those cured by active hydrogen-containing compounds. DIC (Dainippon
Ink and Chemicals) has produced EPICLON HPC-8000, a dicyclopentadiene
phenol novolac-based active ester for low-dielectric epoxy thermosets.25 Japan Epoxy Resins has developed DC808, a phenol
novolac-based active ester for the same purpose.

SABIC (Saudi
Basic Industries Corporation) has developed a phenyl
methacrylate end-capped oligo(2,6-dimethyl phenylene oxide), NORYL
SA9000 (Figure 1a),
for the low-dielectric PCB.26 The key application
areas of NORYL SA9000 are in electronic packaging including PCB laminates,
copper clad laminates, nonepoxy prepregs, and adhesives. NORYL SA9000
is designed to react with unsaturated monomers, styrenic, allylic,
acrylic, maleimide, methacrylic, and unsaturated polyesters through
free-radical reactions. It has an advantage in insulating materials,
where very low dielectric constant and moisture absorption are required.
Except phenyl methacrylate end capping, MGC (Mitsubishi gas chemical)
has developed a vinylbenzyl ether end-capped oligo(2,6-dimethyl phenylene
oxide), OPE-2st (Figure 1b). The thermoset of the OPE-2st exhibits a low dielectric constant
of 2.65U and a very low dissipation factor of 0.005U.27,28

Figure 1 Structure of (a) SA9000 and (b) OPE-2st.

In our previous work,29 we have reacted
phenyl methacrylate and glycidyl phenyl ether in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP), and the reaction product is exclusive 1,3-diphenoxy-2-methacryalatepropane
(Figure 2). On the
basis of Figure 2,
we understand the reaction mechanism of phenyl methacrylate and with
epoxy in the presence of DMAP.

Figure 2 Reaction of glycidyl phenyl ether with
phenyl methacrylate in the
presence of DMAP.

For the low-dielectric
PCB, poly (aryl ether)s also have low-dielectric
characteristics compared to other polymer materials. For example,
Wang et al. prepared a series of poly(aryl ether)s, and their dielectric
constants are in the range of 2.5–3.0.30−33 In our previous work,34 we have successfully prepared a phenol-functionalized
phosphinated poly (aryl ether) (P1). P1, with phenolic linkages, can
react with cresol novolac epoxy (CNE) to get a transparent and flexible
thermosetting film with a high Tg value
(250 °C), a moderate dielectric constant (3.10), and flame retardancy
(VTM-0). However, the secondary alcohols, resulted from the reaction
of an epoxy group and the phenolic hydroxyl of P1, hinder P1-cured
epoxy thermoset to be low-dielectric. To prepare epoxy thermosets
with better dielectric properties, we modify P1 to polyether with
acetic moieties (P1-act), with phenyl methacrylic moieties (P1-mma),
and with vinylbenzyl ether moieties (P1-vbe) by respectively reacting
P1 with acetic anhydride, methacrylic anhydride, and 4-chloromethyl
styrene. P1-act, with an acetic structure, is definitely an active
ester-type curing agent. P1-mma, with a phenyl methacrylic structure,
can also react with epoxy resins (based on the finding of Figure 2). Therefore, in
this work, P1-act and P1-mma are applied to react with epoxy resin
to form secondary hydroxyl-free epoxy thermosets. P1-vbe, with reactive
vinylbenzyl ether moiety, was self-cured to a low-dielectric thermoset.
Detailed synthetic procedures, structure analysis, and thermal and
dielectric properties of the resulting thermosets are provided.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of P1-act
P1-act was synthesized
from the
reaction of P1 and acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst.
Sodium acetate, DMAP, and pyridine have been tested as the catalyst
for the synthesis (Table 1). We found that the optimal reaction is reacting in N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) at 130 °C
for 12 h in the presence of 1 wt % sodium acetate (run 5). 1H NMR spectrum of P1-act (Figure 3b) shows the disappearance of the hydroxyl peak at
9.4 ppm and appearance of the acetic peak at 2.2 ppm. IR spectrum
(Figure S1) shows an obvious C=O
absorption at 1761 cm–1. Both NMR and IR spectra
support the structure of P1-act.

Synthesis of
P1-mma
P1-mma was prepared from the reaction
of P1 with methacrylic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst. Table 2 lists the influence
of reaction conditions on the preparation of P1-mma. The suitable
reaction conditions are using sodium acetate (run 5) or DMAP (run
6) at 45 °C. 1H NMR spectrum of P1-mma (Figure 3c) shows the disappearance
of the hydroxyl peak at 9.4 ppm and the appearance of new peaks at
6.2, 5.8, and 1.9 ppm, which evidences the methacrylic protons. IR
spectrum (Figure S2) shows an obvious C=O
and C=C absorption at 1734 and 1649 cm–1,
respectively. Both NMR and IR spectra support the structure of P1-mma.

Synthesis of P1-vbe
P1-vbe was synthesized from the
reaction of P1 with 4-chloromethyl styrene in the presence of K2CO3. 1H NMR spectrum of P1-vbe (Figure 3d) shows the disappearance
of the hydroxyl peak at 9.4 ppm and appearance of new vinyl protons
at 5.8 and 5.2 ppm and O–CH2-Ar protons at 4.9 ppm.
IR spectrum (Figure S3) shows an obvious
C=C absorption at 1659 cm–1. Both NMR and
IR spectra support the structure of P1-vbe.

Thermomechanical Property
of Thermosets
Figure 4 shows the photos of (a) P1-act/epoxy,
(b) P1-mma/epoxy, and (c) P1-vbe thermosets. All the films show flexibility.
Because all the films are flexible, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) are used to measure their thermal
properties.

Figure 4 Photos of (a) P1-act/epoxy, (b) P1-mma/epoxy, and (c) P1-vbe thermosets.

Figure 5a shows
the DMA thermograms of P1-act/epoxy. The results are listed in Table 3. Recall that P1-act/epoxy
cured at each temperature for 1 h is named P1-act/epoxy-1, while thermosets
cured at each temperature for 2 h is named P1-act/epoxy-2. The Tg values are dependent on the curing program.
For example, the Tg value of P1-act/CNE-2
is 238 °C, which is 15 °C higher than that of P1-act/CNE-1.
Similar results are found for HP7200 and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol
A (DGEBA) systems. Figure 5b shows TMA thermograms of P1-act/epoxy. The Tg value of P1-act/CNE-2 is 214 °C, which is 17 °C
higher than that of P1-act/CNE-1. The trend is similar to DMA data.
The value in parenthesis is the data of P1/epoxy.34 P1-act/epoxy displays lower Tg values than P1/epoxy. This is the penalty of epoxy thermosets cured
by active ester compared with those cured by active hydrogens because
the secondary alcohol resulting from the reaction of active hydrogen
with epoxy provides the intermolecular interaction.

Figure 6a shows
DMA thermograms of P1-mma/epoxy. An obvious increase in Tg (25–36 °C) was observed when comparing with
P1-act/epoxy. For example, the Tg value
of P1-mma/CNE is 274 °C, which is 36 °C higher than that
of P1-act/CNE-2. This result suggests that the curing of methacrylic
moiety contributes to the rigidity of epoxy thermosets. Figure 6b shows TMA thermograms of
P1-mma/epoxy. The Tg value of P1-mma/CNE
is 241 °C, which is 28 °C higher than that of P1-act/CNE-2.
DMA and TMA thermograms demonstrate a high Tg characteristic of P1-mma/epoxy.

Figure 6 (a) DMA and (b) TMA thermograms
of P1-mma/epoxy.

Figure 7a shows
DMA thermograms of P1-vbe-220 and P1-vbe-240. P1-vbe-240 exhibits
a Tg value as high as 302 °C, which
is 55 °C higher than that of P1-vbe-220. In addition, the height
of tan δ of P1-vbe-240 is much smaller than that of P1-vbe-220.
Compared with the high modulus of P1-vbe-240 after Tg, the modulus of P1-vbe-220 after Tg decreases rapidly. In addition, the height of tan δ
of P1-vbe-220 is 1.7. Both the modulus and tan δ indicate that
a further curing is necessary. The height of tan δ of P1-vbe-240
is only 0.4, indicating that a rigid network was formed. Figure 7b shows TMA thermograms
of P1-vbe-220 and P1-vbe-240. The Tg value
of P1-vbe-240 is 263 °C, which is also much higher than that
(219 °C) of P1-vbe-220. The coefficient of thermal expansion
(CTE) of P1-vbe-240 is 49 ppm/°C, which is much smaller than
that (61 ppm/°C) of P1-vbe-220. Both DMA data (Tg value and height of tan δ) and TMA data (Tg value and CTE) suggest that curing at 240
°C leads to better thermal properties. However, to avoid thermal
degradation, a further increase in curing temperature is not performed
and discussed.

Thermal Stability
Table 3 lists the
thermal stability data of the resulting
thermosets. For P1-act/epoxy and P1-mma/epoxy, the 5 wt % degradation
temperatures (Td5) in a nitrogen atmosphere
are in the range of 372–391 °C, and char yields range
from 32 to 50%. These values are similar or slightly higher than typical
epoxy thermosets. P1-vbe-240 is the only thermoset with Td5 higher than 400 °C, demonstrating the best thermal
stability.

Refractive Index and Dielectric Constant
Figure 8a shows
the ellipsometry curves
of P1-act/epoxy at various wavelengths. Table 3 lists the refractive index (n) at 633 nm. Table 3 also lists the dielectric constant (ε), calculated from the
Maxwell’s equation, ε = 1.1n2. P1-act/epoxy shows smaller dielectric constant than P1/epoxy. For
example, the dielectric constant of P1-act/HP7200-2 is 2.71, which
is much lower than that (3.07) of P1/HP7200. The value of 2.71, which
is very low compared with general polyimide (Katpon around 3.2) and
epoxy thermosets (around 3.5).35−39 The results in Table 3 indicate the low-dielectric characteristic of P1-act as a curing
agent. Hougham et al. reported that the dielectric constant can be
reduced by increasing the free volume and molecule’s hydrophobicity
and by decreasing polarization.40 The less
polarity of ester moiety in P1-act/epoxy than the secondary alcohol
moiety in P1/epoxy is thought to be responsible for the lower dielectric
constant. Moreover, the Tg corresponding
to the dielectric constant of 2.71 is as high as 225 °C, indicating
that our approach can achieve epoxy thermosets with a low-dielectric
and high-Tg characteristic. Table 3 also shows the refractive index
and the corresponding dielectric constant of P1-mma/epoxy (Figure 8b). Compared with
P1-act/epoxy, a further reduction in refractive index was observed,
probably because of the cross-linking and the aliphatic polymeric
structure. The corresponding dielectric constant of P1-vbe-240 is
as low as 2.64 (Figure 8c). The dielectric constant and dissipation factor of P1-vbe-240
have been measured by using an Agilent E5071C network analyzer at
10 GHz with a sample size of 9.0 cm × 9.0 cm × 80 μm.
The value for dielectric constant and dissipation factor is 2.83U and 0.008U, respectively. The dielectric
properties of P1-vbe-240 are not as good as those (2.65U and 0.005U) of thermoset of OPE-2st of MGC,27,28 probably because of the biphenylene phosphinate moiety, which exhibits
a polar P=O moiety. Therefore, the values of 2.83U and 0.008U for a material with a built-in flame
retardant element are still attractive.

Conclusions
Epoxy
thermosets cured from phenolic hydroxyls lead to highly polar
secondary alcohols, which hinder epoxy thermoset to be low-dielectric.
To solve this problem, we have successfully prepared three phosphinated
poly(aryl ethers): P1-act, P1-mma, and P1-vbe with acetic, phenyl
methacrylic, and vinylbenzyl ether moiety, respectively, from a phenolic
hydroxyl-containing polyether (P1). P1-act, exhibiting active ester
structures, can react with epoxy to form a secondary alcohol-free
epoxy thermoset. Therefore, P1-act/epoxy shows a lower dielectric
constant than P1/epoxy, indicating that the conversion of phenol OH
to acetic moiety is a successful approach to prepare an epoxy thermoset
with a low dielectric constant. However, compared with the Tg of P1/epoxy, a penalty in Tg (about 15 °C reduction) is found for P1-act/epoxy.
Through the cross-linking of methacrylate linkage, P1-mma/epoxy shows
an obvious increase in Tg (25–36
°C) when comparing with P1-act/epoxy. A Tg value as high as 274 °C can be achieved for P1-mma/CNE
from the DMA thermogram. Furthermore, compared with the P1-act/epoxy,
a further reduction in the dielectric constant is found for P1-mma/epoxy.
A Dk value as low as 2.71U is found for P1-mma/CNE. As to the self-curing of P1-vbe, P1-vbe-240
exhibits a Tg as high as 302 °C (DMA
data), a moderate-to-low CTE of 49 ppm/°C, and a low dielectric
constant of 2.64U. These properties make P1-act,
P1-mma, and P1-vbe attractive for electronic application, especially
in preparing high-performance PCBs.

Experimental Section
Materials
The phenol-functionalized phosphinated polyether
(P1) was prepared according to the procedure in our previous work.34 Acetic anhydride, DMAP, and sodium acetate were
purchased from TCI. Methacrylic anhydride, t-butyl
cumyl peroxide (TBCP), and 4-chloromethyl styrene were purchased from
Acros. DGEBA with an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) of 187 g/equiv,
and CNE with an EEW of 200 g/equiv were kindly supplied by Chang Chun
Plastics, Taiwan. Dicyclopentadiene epoxy (HP7200, DIC) with an EEW
of 269 g/equiv was kindly supplied by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
Corporation under the commercial name of HP-7200. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP; HPLC grade from Showa) and DMAc (HPLC grade
from Showa) were purified by distillation under reduced pressure over
calcium hydride (from Acros) and stored over molecular sieves.

Synthesis
of P1-act
P1 (10.0 g, repeat unit 14.3 mmol),
sodium acetate (0.10 g), and DMAc (100 mL) were added into 250 mL
flask and stirred under nitrogen. Acetic anhydride (10.22 g, 0.1 mol)
was added gradually. The reaction was stirred at 130 °C for 12
h (Scheme 1) under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained mixture was poured into methanol.
The light white precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven
at 60 °C for 8 h. The isolated yield is 90%.

methacrylic anhydride (1.76 g, 0.17 mol), DMAc (50 mL), and DMAP (0.025g)
were added into a 100 mL flask and stirred at 45 °C for 12 h
under a nitrogen atmosphere (Scheme 1). The obtained mixture was poured into methanol. The
light white precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at

4-chloromethyl styrene (1.18
g, 0.08 mol), and DMAc (50 mL) were added into the 100 mL flask and

was poured into methanol. The off-white precipitate was filtered and
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 8 h. The isolated yield is
90%.

Curing Procedure of P1-act with Epoxy
P1-act was thermally
cured with DGEBA, HP7200, and CNE, respectively. The molar ratio of
acetic moiety to oxirane (epoxy moiety) is 1. P1-act, epoxy resin,
and 0.5 wt % of DMAP (based on the weight of epoxy) were dissolved
in NMP to make a solution with solid content with 30%. The viscous
solution was applied on an automatic film applicator to make a thin
film on a glass substrate. The resulting thin films were dried at
80 °C for 12 h. Then, under a nitrogen atmosphere, two curing
processes were applied. The first process is 160, 180, 200, and 220 °C
for each 1 h, and the second process is 160, 180, 200, and 220 °C
for each 2 h. Epoxy thermosets cured by P1-act is generally named
P1-act/epoxy. The thermosets cured from the first process are named
P1-act/DGEBA-1, P1-act/HP7200-1, and P1-act/CNE-1 if the epoxy is
specified, whereas thermosets cured from the second curing process
are named P1-act/DGEBA-2, P1-act/HP7200-2, and P1-act/CNE-2.

Curing
Procedure of P1-mma with Epoxy
P1-mma was thermally
cured with DGEBA, HP7200, and CNE, respectively. The molar ratio of
the phenyl methacrylic moiety to oxirane (epoxy moiety) is 1. P1-mma,
epoxy resin, 0.5 wt % of DMAP (based on the weight of epoxy), and
TBCP (based on the weight of P1-mma) were dissolved in NMP to make
a solution with a solid content of 30%. An automatic film applicator
was used to cast a thin film on a glass substrate. The resulting thin
films were dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Then, under a nitrogen atmosphere,
the curing process is 160, 180, 200, and 220 °C for each 2 h.
Epoxy thermosets cured by P1-mma is generally named P1-mma/epoxy.
The names P1-mma/DGEBA, P1-mma/HP7200, and P1-mma/CNE are applied
if the epoxy is specified.

Curing Procedure of P1-vbe
P1-vbe,
with reactive vinylbenzyl
ether moiety, was self-cured to P1-vbe thermoset. P1-vbe and 1.0 wt
% of TBCP (based on the weight of P1-vbe) were dissolved in dioxane
to make a solution with a solid content of 30%. The viscous solution
was cast by an automatic film applicator to make a thin film on a
glass substrate. The resulting thin films were dried at 80 °C
for 12 h. Then, cured by the process 160, 180, 200, and 220 °C
for each 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The thermoset is named P1-vbe-X,
in which X is the final curing temperature. For example, if the final
curing temperature is 220 °C, it is named P1-vbe-220. If the
final curing temperature is 240 °C, it is named P1-vbe-240.

Characterization
NMR measurements were performed by
using a Varian Inova 600 NMR in DMSO-d6. DMA was performed by using a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond DMA. The
test was performed by a tension mode with an amplitude of 5 mm and
with a sample size of 5.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.2 cm. The storage
modulus and tan δ were recorded with a frequency of 1 Hz at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The dielectric constant was performed
by using an Agilent E5071C network analyzer at 10 GHz. The sample
size was 9.0 cm × 9.0 cm × 80 μm. TMA was performed
with a SII TMA/SS6100 at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The CTE
was recorded at the temperature range of 50–150 °C. Thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a PerkinElmer Pyris1.
The relationship between the temperature and the sample weight was
recorded at a heating rate of 20 °C/min in a nitrogen or air
atmosphere. The refractive index (n) at various wavelengths
was obtained by using an Ellipsometry GES-5E. The dielectric constant
(Dk) was calculated from the Maxwell’s
equation of Dk = 1.1n2, in which n is the refractive index
at 633 nm.
