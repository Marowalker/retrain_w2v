This
work presents an electronic structure study employing multireference
configuration interaction MRCI calculations with Davidson correction
(+Q) of the ytterbium monobromide YbBr molecule. Adiabatic potential
energy curves (PECs), dipole moment curves, and spectroscopic constants
(such as Re, ωe, Be, De, Te, and μe) of the low-lying bound electronic
states are determined. The ionic character of the YbBr molecule at
the equilibrium position is also discussed. With spin–orbit
effects, 30 low-lying states in Ω = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 representation
are probed. The electronic transition dipole moment is calculated
between the investigated states and then used to determine transition
coefficients, for example, the Einstein coefficient of spontaneous
emission Aij and emission
oscillator strength fij. Vibrational parameters such as Eν, Bν, Dν, Rmin, and Rmax of the low vibrational levels of different bound states in both
Λ and Ω representations are also calculated. Upon calculating
the Franck–Condon factors, they are found to be perfectly diagonal
between three couples of low-lying excited states. Vibrational Einstein
coefficients and radiative lifetimes are computed as well for the
lowest vibrational transitions. Most of the data reported in this
work are presented here for the first time in the literature. Very
good accordance is obtained in comparison with the previously reported
constants by means of experimental methods.

1 Introduction
Since early 1970s, considerable interest has emerged in studying
the electronic properties of lanthanide-containing diatomic molecules.
The molecular structure, spectra, chemical properties, and bonding
mechanisms of ytterbium-containing molecules have received special
attention. Kramer1 was the first to conduct
vibrational analysis and spectroscopic characterization of the A2Π1/2,3/2–X2Σ+ transition of YbX (X = Cl, Br, and I)to determine the bandhead
positions and transition. Kaledin et al.2 performed ligand field theory calculations to study the electronic
structure of lanthanide monohalides including YbBr. Dickinson et al.3 used Fourier transform microwave spectrometry
to analyze the low-lying vibrational bands (ν = 0, 1) of the
B2Σ+–X2Σ+ system of YbBr. They also conducted a rotational analysis of the
0–0, 1–0, 0–1, and 1–1 bands of the same
system4 and the 0–0 and 1–0
bands of the A2Π–X2Σ+ system, as an extension to their work.5 Su et al.6 calculated the ground-state
potential energy curves (PECs) and the ground-state spectroscopic
parameters of the YbX (X: F, Cl, Br, I, and At) molecules using the
unrestricted coupled cluster UCCSD(T) method with the ECP28MDF basis
set for the Yb atom. A thermal excitation technique was used to study
the emission spectrum and vibrational transitions of YbBr7 from which the band sequence (Δν
= ±3, ±4) of the A2Π–X2Σ+ system and those of the B2Σ+–X2Σ+ system (up to ν
= 7 of the higher state) is obtained. As far as it is reported in
literature, the investigation of the PECs and spectroscopic properties
of YbBr has been limited to the ground state only. However, none of
the previous studies has reported any information on the dipole moment
of any of its molecular states, including the ground state. Such a
lack of information has motivated us to thoroughly investigate the
electronic structure of the low-lying states of the ytterbium monobromide
molecule, using ab initio quantum chemistry calculations. This study
also comes as a continuation to our previous publication,8 dealing with the spectroscopic properties of
YbX molecules with X: F, Cl, Br, and I.

In the present work,
multireference configuration interaction MRCI
level of theory with Davidson correction (+Q) is employed to investigate
the PECs of eight doublet 2Λ(+/−) and six quartet 4Λ(+/−) states
with 30 spin–orbit Ω low-lying electronic states of YbBr.
The spectroscopic constants as equilibrium internuclear distance Re, harmonic frequency ωe, rotational
constant Be, transition energy with respect
to ground state minimum Te, and permanent
dipole moment μe are calculated for the investigated
states. The static dipole moment curves (DMCs) are computed for 14Λ–S
electronic states at the spin-free level and for 30 lowest states
with spin–orbit effects in the representation of Ω =
1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2. The transition dipole moment μij between three couples of 2Λ states
is also investigated and used to determine Einstein spontaneous emission
coefficients Aij, spontaneous
radiative lifetime τij, and emission
oscillator strength fij among them. For low vibrational levels (with J =
0), we computed the vibrational parameters (Eν, Bν, Dν, Rmin, and Rmax) in both Λ and Ω representations,
the Franck–Condon factors (FCFs), Einstein coefficients, and
radiation lifetimes for transitions between them. Good accordance
is obtained upon comparison with the constants’ values reported
in the literature, and new data are reported for the first time.

2 Computational Method
The present study of the YbBr
electronic structure is conducted
by using the high-level ab initio calculations as applied in the MOLPRO
2012 computing package9 and the graphical
interface GABEDIT.10 Regarding coupling
of spin and orbital angular momenta, they are uncoupled for the Λ–S
states and coupled for the Ω states. The state-average complete
active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach is employed to
generate multiconfiguration wave functions, which are used to perform
internally contracted multireference single and double configuration
interaction calculations, including Davidson correction (MRCI +Q).11 After testing several basis sets to describe
the ytterbium atom, we selected small-core quasi-relativistic energy-consistent
pseudopotential ECP28MWB12 with the segmented
(14s13p10d8f6g/10s8p5d4f3g) basis set13 which is augmented by the s2pdfg diffuse functions.14 The bromine atom is described by the correlation consistent
basis set including spdfg functions in conjunction with small-core
relativistic pseudopotential ECP10MDF_AV5Z.15 The active space in CASSCF calculations contains 3σ (Yb: 6s,6pz; Br: 4pz) and
2π (Yb: 6pxy; Br: 4pxy) molecular orbitals to be occupied by seven valence
electrons. In the C2v point group symmetry, this active space is distributed into 3a1, 2b1, 2b2, 0a2, and noted
by [3,2,2,0]. The molecular orbitals involved in the active space
of YbBr are 1σ1π 2σ 2π3σ. The first
two σ MOs arise from the active atomic orbitals of (Yb: 6s)
and (Br: 4pz). The third σ MO comes
mainly from (Yb: 6pz), whereas the remaining
MOs, 1π and 2π, come from (Yb: 6px6py) and (Br: 4px4py) atomic orbitals. For the sake
of time traceability, the orbitals of the 4f shell of ytterbium were
kept frozen by being strictly doubly occupied, and thus the states
that are associated with the excitations of the corresponding electrons
are not treated in this work. However, considering the dynamical electronic
correlation of the electrons occupying 4f14 of Yb and 4s2 of Br in the MRCI +Q calculations has an augmenting effect
on the molecular states correlating with the lowest dissociation limit
at Yb(1S) + Br(3P) fragments. Therefore, 23
electrons in all of the YbBr molecules are correlated in the MRCI
+Q step of calculations. For the spin–orbit coupling (SOC)
effect to be considered in the MRCI +Q calculations,16 the effective core potential (ECP) method17−19 is used and spin–orbit effects are introduced for both atoms
through spin–orbit pseudopotentials. The energies of the molecular
states, with Ω = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 are computed by diagonalizing
the total Hamiltonian (Ht = He + WSO), that is, the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation and the spin–orbit perturbation pseudopotential.
The internuclear distance R at which calculations
were conducted ranges between 2.24 and 10 Å at an increment of
0.02 Å around the equilibrium position Re and 0.1 Å elsewhere.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 PECs and Dipole Moments
of the Low-Lying Λ–S
and Ω States of YbBr
The spin-free PECs of 14 low-lying
doublet and quartet Λ–S electronic states of YbBr are
presented in Figure 1. The lowest molecular dissociation asymptote Yb(1S) +
Br(2P) associates with the ground state X2Σ+ and the first excited state, 12Π. The second
asymptote Yb(3P) + Br(2P) is associated with
the following states: two 2,4Σ+, two 2,4Π, one 2,4Σ–, and
one 2,4Δ. An undulation in the PECs of the 32Π and 12Σ– states
is noticed after 5 Å. This may be related to the electronic wave
functions of these states leading to the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation. Among the investigated states; 32Π,
14Π, 24Π, and 24Σ+ are found unbound, and the PEC of the 22Σ+ state shows two minima. Figure 1 shows several crossings and avoided crossings
between energy curves. Their corresponding positions, RC and RAC, and the energy
separation at the avoided crossing region ΔEAC are given in Table S1 as the Supporting Information. A region of PECs interaction is noticed within
the range 3.2 ≤ R ≤ 3.5 Å in which
the energy minimum of each of 22Π and 32Σ+ is located. Such interaction affects the stability
of the molecule in these states. Concerning the valence configuration
of the ground-state molecular orbitals of YbBr, the orbitals of the
closed 4f shell of the Yb atom are not involved in bonding.6 Therefore, the covalent configuration (4f14) 1σ21π4 2σ1 of the X2Σ+ state is dominant at long
internuclear distances, whereas the ionic configuration (4f14) 1σ11π4 2σ2 is
dominant at short distances indicating a charge transfer from Yb to
Br near the equilibrium position.7 The
molecular configurations of the 22Σ+ and
12Π electronic states close to the equilibrium distance
are (4f14) 1π4 2σ23σ1 and 1π4 2σ2 2π1, respectively. The spectroscopic constants (Te, Re, ωe, and Be) of the investigated Λ–S
bound states are calculated by fitting the energy values around the
equilibrium position into a polynomial in terms of the internuclear
distance R while considering the weighted average
over the different isotopes. The ionic character fionic = μe/eRe is calculated as an indicator of the molecular bond nature at the
state’s equilibrium position. The constants of the 22Π and 32Σ+ states are not calculated
as an avoided crossing interaction takes place at their equilibrium
positions, neither those of the 12Δ and 12Σ– as their shallowness prevents generating
correct polynomial coefficients. Table 1 lists the calculated parameters and the corresponding
values available in the literature from both experimental and theoretical
methods. In close comparison, this table shows that our calculated
spectroscopic constants of the ground state X2Σ+ are in excellent agreement with those determined experimentally.
The relative differences of equilibrium internuclear distance Re and rotational constant Be are δRe/Re = 0.72% (ref (4)), 0.64% (ref (3)), and δBe/Be = 2.03% (refs (4) and (5)). For harmonic
frequency ωe, the relative difference ranges between
0.49% ≤ δωe/ωe ≤
1.34% (ref (4)). These
constants are in better accordance with the experimental values than
those calculated by the UCCSD(T) method for the 174Yb79Br isotopologue.6 In terms of
the dissociation energy De, our calculated
value is 295.2 kJ/mol and those calculated at the UCCSD(T) level of
theory are 505.8 and 451.7 kJ/mol (ref (6)), whereas the experimental value is 316 kJ/mol
(ref (20)). From above,
it is noticed that our MRCI calculation significantly improves the
theoretical De value. However, there are
many factors which may influence the theoretically calculated dissociation
energy such as the selected basis sets, the chosen active space, the
number of valence electrons, the correlation relation among them,
the interaction of the ground state with the close-lying excited states
at long internuclear distances, the theoretical method of calculation,
and so forth.

For the first excited state, 12Π, the relative
differences with respect to the experimentally reported values of Re and Be are δRe/Re = 0.61% (ref (5)) and δBe/Be = 1.99% (ref (5)) and those for the 22Σ+ state constants are δRe/Re = 0.65% (ref (4)), δBe/Be = 1.97% (ref (4)), and 2.14% ≤ δωe/ωe ≤ 3.02% (ref (4)). The adaptation of 23
correlated electrons as in the present work has shown significant
improvement of the constants calculated. When the electrons occupying
4f14 of Yb and 4s2 of Br are included in the
core such that the valence electrons are only seven, the calculated
constants show large dispersion from the experimental values. The
percentage of ionic character fionic in
the molecular bond is calculated for the lowest doublet states and
is provided in Table 1. It is 37.6% for X2Σ+, 46.1% for 12Π, and 45.3% for 22Σ+. These
percentages indicate the strong ionic character of ytterbium halides.

For further investigation of the YbBr low-lying electronic states,
30 electronic states in the Ω representation are generated from
the 14Λ–S states by considering the SOC effect. The PECs
of symmetries Ω = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 are plotted as a function
of the internuclear distance in the region between 2.24 and 10.0 Å
as shown in Figures 2–4. When the SOC
effects are taken into consideration, the spin-free dissociation asymptote
Yb(1S) + Br(2P) splits into two branches: Yb(1S0) + Br(2P3/2) and Yb(1S0) + Br(2P1/2), while the
dissociation limit Yb(3P) + Br(2P) splits into
six branches: Yb(3P0) + Br(2P3/2), Yb(3P1) + Br(2P3/2), Yb(3P2) + Br(2P3/2), Yb(3P0) + Br(2P1/2), Yb(3P1) + Br(2P1/2), and Yb(3P2) + Br(2P1/2). The first asymptote correlates with the (1)1/2 and (1)3/2
states; meanwhile, the second one correlates with the (2)1/2 state
lying at approximately 3500 cm–1 above the first
asymptote. The 4.6% relative difference with the NIST experimental
energy value of 3685.24 cm–1 (ref (21)) indicates a very good
agreement. The third asymptote correlates with (3)1/2 and (2)3/2 states
lying approximately at 15 116 cm–1, where
the NIST value is 17 288.439 cm–1. These
calculations are obtained considering diffuse functions in describing
the ytterbium atom. Contrary to this consideration, the dissociation
asymptote energies are shifted higher causing larger relative difference
at the dissociation limit. Again, the large number of correlated electrons,
23 electrons as in this work, promotes the dispersion forces effectively
on the dissociation limits as using diffuse functions constrains their
effect. There are fifteen states of Ω = 1/2, ten of Ω
= 3/2, four of Ω = 5/2, and one of Ω = 7/2. The (3)1/2
state shows several avoided crossings with lower and higher Ω
= 1/2 states, which renders two potential wells for the corresponding
state. The interaction with the Ω components of the lower excited 2Σ+ and 2Π states causes
many avoided crossings to take place between R =
3.0 and 3.6 Å. Several avoided crossings have been recorded for
the PECs of the Ω = 1/2, 3/2, and their positions are given
in Table 2. Such behaviors
in the PECs of the low excited states lead to perturbations in the
vibrational levels of the Ω components, for example, (4)1/2,
(2)3/2, and (5)1/2 of 22Π and 32Σ+ states, hence causing difficulty for an accurate description
of these levels. The spectroscopic constants such as Re, Te, ωe, Be, and μe along with
the De values of different Ω bound
states and the dominant SΛ compositions at Re are determined and given in Table 3. The dominant SΛ component of (1)1/2
is 99.87% X2Σ+; hence, these two states,
(1)1/2 and X2Σ+, have nearly the same
spectroscopic constants. The main parent SΛ of the (2)1/2 and
(1)3/2 states is 12Π with percentage compositions
of 94.80 and 99.94%, respectively. The spectroscopic parameters of
the (2)1/2 and (1)3/2 states are very close to those of 12Π. Also, the main SΛ component of the (3)1/2 is 22Σ+ (94.90%) with congruent parameters. The
comparison between our calculated transition energy Te of the (2)1/2 and (1)3/2 states and those experimental
values available in the literature1 shows
excellent agreement, where the relative differences are 0.26 and 0.82%,
respectively.

At the MRCI +Q level, the dipole
moments for the investigated spin-free
Λ–S states are also computed and given in Figure 5. However, the dipole moments
of the high doublet states, that is, 32Π and 12Σ– are not presented at long distances
due to curve discontinuity. With the ytterbium atom at the origin,
the negative value corresponds to the Ybδ+Brδ− polarity. Figure 5 shows that the DMCs of the investigated
states smoothly approaches zero at large distances, which is the natural
behavior for a molecule dissociating into its neutral fragments. This
figure also shows drastic changes in the DMC of different states.
By identification with respect to the PECs, it can be noticed that
these changes occur at the avoided crossing positions RAC that are given in Table S1.·In the region near R = 3.3 Å, the polarity
of some states flips indicating an ionic character exchange between
two states, for example, between X2Σ+ and
22Σ+ at R = 5 Å.
The difference between the electronegativity of the two atoms EN(Br)
> EN(Yb) is reflected by the negative values that the dipole moment
of the ground state possesses at different distances. Its largest
amplitude of |μ| = 4.368 a.u. is calculated at R = 4.4 Å. States with large dipole moment amplitudes are known
to be useful for molecular alignment in an optical lattice, and they
are helpful while studying long-range dipole–dipole forces.
For the bound states, the DM values μe at the equilibrium
distances are listed in Table 1. We can notice that the ionic character of the doublet states
around the equilibrium position is greater than that of the quartet
states. The DMs of the investigated Ω states are also plotted
as function of internuclear distance R and are given
in Figures 6–8. However, the dipole moments
of the (9)3/2 and (3)5/2 states are not presented at long distances
due to curve discontinuity. One can notice the consistency between
the positions of the avoided crossings of the PECs (Figures 2–4 and Table 2) and
the drastic crossings of DMCs of these Ω states. In addition,
the DMCs of (1)1/2 and (3)1/2 show maximum values |μ| = 3.444
a.u. near R = 3.9 Å and |μ| = 5.031 a.u.
around R = 5.6 Å, respectively. Table 3 lists the μe values of the lowest Ω bound states.

The transition DMCs between the
obtained states are computed at
the spin-free MRCI +Q level and are shown in Figure 9. These curves approach zero as R ≥ 7.5 Å due to spin-forbidden transitions from Yb(1S) to Yb(3P) atomic orbitals at asymptotic limits.

rate of the single-electron oscillator at the emission frequency γcl, and emission oscillator strength fij, for the X2Σ+–12Π, 12Π–22Σ+, and X2Σ+–22Σ+ electronic transitions are determined
and listed in Table S2. These constants
are calculated using the upper state μij TDM value at the equilibrium position as follows22        where νij is the transition frequency between the two states, h is Plank’s constant, ε0 is the
vacuum permittivity, me is the mass of
an electron, e is the electronic charge, and c is the speed of
light. The spontaneous radiative lifetimes (τi = 1/∑jAij where j runs for
the underlying states of the i state) are 14.97 and
17.55 ns for the 12Π and 22Σ+ states, respectively. The X2Σ+–12Π transition has the largest oscillator
strength. No comparison is conducted for the calculated dipole moments
(DM and TDM) and the emission coefficients as they are provided here
for the first time.

3.2 FCFs and Einstein Coefficients
between the
Lowest Vibrational Levels of YbBr
Vibrational energy Eν, rotational constant Bν, centrifugal distortion constant Dν, and the abscissas of turning points Rmin and Rmax are determined
for the lowest Λ–S and Ω bound states by using
the canonical function approach.23−25 The reduced mass of
the standard atomic weights of Yb and Br is used by ignoring isotopic
effects. The rovibrational parameters of the X2Σ+, 12Π, and 22Σ+ states are presented in Table S3 in the Supporting Information file. The calculated vibrational transition energies
of 22Σ+(ν′)–X2Σ+(ν) and 12Π(ν′)–X2Σ+(ν) systems, that are given in Table
S4 as the Supporting Information, are in
good accordance with the values reported in refs.4,5Table 4 lists the parameters for the lowest vibrational
levels of the (1)1/2, (2)1/2, (1)3/2, and (3)1/2 states. Table S5 lists the energy separation values between
the lowest vibrational levels of the (2)1/2, (1)3/2, (3)1/2, and the
ground state (1)1/2 showing significant agreement upon comparison
with the experimentally determined values,1,7 where
the relative difference is lower than 2%.

By using Le Roy’s
LEVEL8.2 program,26 FCFs fν′ν for the
X2Σ+–12Π, X2Σ+–22Σ+ and 12Π–22Σ+ transitions are calculated and tabulated in Table S6. For more accurate description of the lowest vibrational
wave functions overlap of YbBr, the FCF values are also calculated
and given in Table 5 for the (2)1/2–(1)1/2, (1)3/2–(1)1/2, (3)1/2–(1)1/2,
(3)1/2–(2)1/2, and (3)1/2–(1)3/2 transitions. With close-lying
equilibrium distances Re and turning points
(Rmin and Rmax) as shown in Table 4 for the lowest vibrational levels of the (3)1/2, (2)1/2, and (1)3/2
states, the (3)1/2–(2)1/2 and (3)1/2–(1)3/2 transitions
have a high diagonal FCF array with f00 = 0.98086 and f00 = 0.98902, respectively.

Using the same program,26 the average
radiative lifetimes and Einstein coefficients of the vibrational transitions
between (X2Σ+ and 22Σ+), (X2Σ+ and 12Π),
and (12Π and 22Σ+) states
are determined. Einstein coefficients for a transition (from a vibrational
state ν′ to a vibrational state ν) are calculated
by using27  where
σνν′ is the wavenumber of the
transition between upper vibrational level
ν′ and lower vibrational level ν (in cm–1); Λ′ and Λ are the projections of electronic
orbital angular momentum on the internuclear axis for the upper and
lower electronic levels. Reνν′ is the electronic-vibrational
transition moment expectation value, which can be obtained from the
vibrational wave functions (ν and ν′) and electronic
transition dipole moment (in atomic units). Table 6 shows that the radiative lifetime between
vibrational transitions of states X2Σ+ and 12Π varies between 15 and 30 ns, and that between
vibrational transitions of states X2Σ+ and 22Σ+ varies between 17 and 30 ns.
On the other hand, the radiative lifetime between the vibrational
transitions of states 12Π and 22Σ+ are thousand times longer with values that vary between 0.37
and 0.40 ms.

4 Conclusions
At the MRCI +Q level of theory and with 23 correlated electrons,
the electronic structure of 14 spin-free low-lying electronic states
of the ytterbium monobromide molecule is investigated in addition
to that of 30 states upon considering the SOC effect. The PECs and
DMCs of the investigated states are plotted then used to determine
the ionic character and spectroscopic constants (Te, Re, ωe, Be, and De) for the bound
states. These curves have shown regions of considerable interaction
in terms of crossings and avoided crossings especially between 3.0
and 3.6 Å. Perturbed states as (4)1/2, (2)3/2, and (5)1/2 are
identified as interactions take place around their potential energy
minimum. The TDM between low-lying doublet states is calculated at
the spin-free level from which emission coefficients and spontaneous
radiative lifetimes are determined. A rovibrational study is conducted
with J = 0 to compute the vibrational parameters
(Eν, Bν, Dν, Rmin, and Rmax) of the low vibrational levels.
All of the molecular constants presented in this work are in very
good agreement with the few data available in the literature as obtained
from both experimental and theoretical methods. Except for the ground
state, this work represents, for the first time, a detailed theoretical
study concerning the electronic structure of the YbBr low-lying states.
