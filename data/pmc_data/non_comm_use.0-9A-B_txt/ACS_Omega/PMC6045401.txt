We report the mechanism of the concentration-dependent
self-assembly
of a tetrapeptide. Peptide Boc-Trp-Leu-Trp-Leu-OMe self-assembles
to form discrete nanospheres at a low concentration. Tryptophan side
chains point outwards of the nanospheres while leucine side chains
point towards the core of the nanospheres. The nanospheres fuse together
to become microspheres with the increase in the peptide concentration.
At higher concentrations of the peptide, the microspheres start clustering.
This is stabilized by the aromatic interactions between the side chains
of the tryptophan residues that cover the outer surface of the peptide
microspheres. In addition to behaving like the conventional hollow
sphere-based drug delivery vehicles which entraps the drug and performs
stimuli-responsive release, this prototype can interact, stabilize,
and intercalate hydrophobic dye carboxyfluorescein and anti-cancer
drug curcumin even on the surface through aromatic interactions. The
dye/drug can be released in acidic pH and in the presence of physiologically
relevant ions such as potassium.

Introduction
Biomolecules have an
intrinsic tendency to self-assemble into various
morphologies.1−9 In the recent years, DNA, lipids, peptides, and proteins have been
utilized in the construction of biomolecule-based nanostructures which
can be put to various applications such as biosensors,10,11 templates for growth of other functional materials,12,13 bioimaging,14 tissue engineering,15 enzymatic catalysis,16−18 gene expression,16,19,20 and drug delivery platform.21−34 The self-assembly process is governed by an intricate interplay
of various noncovalent forces such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic
interactions, aromatic stacking, and electrostatic interactions.35 The self-assembly of biomolecules is dependent
on various factors such as self-assembling building blocks, solvent,
concentration of the peptide, time of incubation, pH of the solution,
and so forth. There are several studies in the literature where transition
in self-assembly has been observed by modulating self-assembling building
blocks,26,36 concentration,34,37−40 solvent,41−43 pH,44 chirality,45 temperature,46 and
by the introduction of chemical groups such as thiol.47

A thorough understanding of the mechanism of the
self-assembly
process and the morphological transitions induced by several factors
is fundamentally essential to be able to manipulate the various factors
to fine tune the self-assembly process and properties for custom-made
applications.21,23,48−50

Self-assembling hollow spheres derived from
a variety of molecules
such as polymers,51−55 fatty acids,56 lipids,57 polypeptides,22−34 and proteins58,59 have been reported to be prospective
drug delivery vehicles. Most of these spherical drug delivery vehicles
entrap the drug molecule and release them in the presence of certain
stimuli such as pH or the presence of physiological cations such as
potassium.24,26

Of the different classes
of biomolecules capable of self-assembling,
peptide- and peptidomimetic-based scaffolds are immensely important
because of their ease and high yields of synthesis, well-defined structure,29,60−63 biocompatibility,8,12,13,31,32,64 diversity, tunability of properties,21,23 and molecular recognition abilities.21,65,66 Diphenylalanine peptide forms the core recognition
motif for the molecular self-assembly in Alzheimer’s disease
identified through a methodical reductionist approach envisioned to
find the minimum recognition motif for self-assembly.13 It has been studied in great detail because of its structural
simplicity, ease of modification,67−76 biocompatibility,14,34,77,78 extremely strong capability of assembling
under various conditions,42,43,79−86 and versatile applications.87 The aromatic
interaction was thought to be one of the important factors driving
the diphenylalanine self-assembly. However, the ditryptophan peptide
does not show similar aggregation properties in spite of having an
aromatic side chain that could have aromatic interactions.13 Verma and co-workers demonstrated that a tetrapeptide
containing the ditryptophan moiety self-assembled to form nanovesicles.88 They also demonstrated that the ditryptophan
moiety when attached to a tridentate ligand also gave rise to spherical
vesicular structures.29

Here, we
report the self-assembly mechanism of a tetrapeptide Boc-Trp-Leu-Trp-Leu-OMe
(P, Figure 1) and its
concentration-dependent morphological transition from unilayered discrete
nanospheres to clustered microspheres. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
acts as a reporter entity and helps in studying the self-assembly
process of the peptide. Dye/drug binding studies significantly help
in understanding the details of the self-assembled morphology. We
further demonstrate that the peptide microspheres interact, intercalate,
and restrain the hydrophobic dye carboxyfluorescein and drug molecule
curcumin on its surface, which are released in the presence of physiologically
relevant cations and acidic pH, in addition to encapsulating the drug
in the conventional way. This dual mode of drug binding, we believe
to the best of our knowledge, is a rather rare approach of drug delivery.
As the drug release can be stimulated by lowering the pH, this model
might find potential applications in cancer drug delivery.

Results and Discussion
Morphology of the peptide assembly
was studied using various electron
microscopic techniques. Figure 2 shows the morphology of P at 10 mM concentrations in various
solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene, MeOH, EtOH, and
so forth. It is clearly evident from the field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) images that P adopts different morphologies in
various solvents. There have been several reports in the literature
of microvesicles/microspheres being used as potential drug delivery
vehicles.22−34 Thus, in our study, we focused only on the spherical morphology
which was obtained in two solvents, namely, EtOH and MeOH. As MeOH
is carcinogenic and in the practical scenario may not be practical
for applications, we decided to continue our studies further with
EtOH. Figure S1a,b shows the particle size
distribution of the microspheres at 10 mM MeOH and EtOH. At 10 mM
concentration of P, microspheres with diameters ranging from 2 to
3 μm were formed predominantly in EtOH. We further found from
FESEM that P self-assembled into nanospheres of 200–300 nm
diameter at as low a concentration as 0.02 mM (Figure 3a). The size of the microspheres was proportional
to the concentration of the peptide solution. We wanted to find out
whether this self-assembly process was kinetically or thermodynamically
governed. Figure 3a,b
shows the morphologies of P after incubation for 2 min and 10 days
at 0.02 mM. There was no visible difference in the morphology, indicating
that the self-assembled morphology of the reported peptide may be
a thermodynamically controlled product. The self-assembled microspheres
were disrupted upon the addition of KCl and formic acid, which is
clear from FESEM images (Figure 3c,d).

(d) 5 μL HCOOH to (a).

For further insight into the self-assembled morphology, field-emission
transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) studies were performed at
the 0.02 mM peptide concentration. From FETEM studies, it was revealed
that P formed nanospheres of diameter of about 200–400 nm
at a concentration of 0.02 mM and microspheres of diameter of about
1–1.1 μm at a concentration of 10 mM, which is in corroboration
with the FESEM data (Figures 4a, S2a). The electron diffraction
pattern in Figure S2b shows that the microspheres
are partly crystalline. However, so far, our attempts to crystallize
the peptide have not succeeded. The particle size distribution of
the microspheres as seen by FETEM at 10 mM is shown in Figure S2c. The average particle size was found
to be 1 μM.

The topology of the self-assembled structures
was studied using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 4b) at the 0.02 mM
peptide concentration. Nanospheres of 200 nm diameter were seen, which
also supported FESEM and FETEM data. Figures 4c,d shows the 3D plot and the surface profile
analysis of the particles to see the width and flatness of the particles
at that concentration.

plot for the peptide nanospheres formed by P at 0.02 mM concentration.

To study the dependence of the
size of the self-assembled nanospheres
on the concentration of the peptide solution, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) experiments were performed. At peptide concentrations of 0.01,
0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 mM, the diameter of the nanospheres varied from
248, 638, 971, and 1410 nm (Figure 5). Thus from DLS studies, it was clearly seen that
with the increase in the concentration, the size of the microsphere
increased, as was previously seen in the FESEM studies. The peptide
formed smaller nanospheres at lower concentrations, which started
fusing with each other to form larger microspheres at higher concentrations.

peptide concentrations showing increasing diameters of 248, 638, 971,
and 1410 nm, respectively.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was performed to look into
the
conformation of tetrapeptide P in the solid state (Figure S3). The most informative frequency ranges for peptides
are (a) 3500–3200 cm–1, which corresponds
to the N–H stretching vibrations of the peptide and N-protecting
urethane groups and (b) 1800–1600 cm–1, which
corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the peptide, urethane,
and ester groups.89−92 Two intense bands were obtained at 3416 and 3312 cm–1 indicating non-hydrogen-bonded and intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded
NHs, respectively.90,92 The intensity of the NH band
at 3312 cm–1 is more than that at 3416 cm–1, indicating hydrogen-bonded structures for the peptide in the solid
state. The characteristic IR absorption bands at about 1641 cm–1 (amide I) and 1531 cm–1 (amide
II) of the tetrapeptide are typical of the β-sheet.89−91 Moreover, the existence of the band at 1689 cm–1 indicated the presence of antiparallel β-sheet structures.90

Circular dichroism (CD) was performed
at different concentrations
of the peptide (Figure S4). Though CD is
a sensitive technique for the prediction of the secondary structure
of polypeptides,93 the limitations on the
use of CD for conformational analysis of small linear peptides with
aromatic residues have been reported.94,95 Moreover,
the secondary structure formation has been shown to be dependent on
the length of the polymers. As P is very small, the presence of random
coil-like CD peaks was not surprising.96 Upon increasing the concentration of P beyond 0.15 mM, a noteworthy
exciton-coupled band appeared at 215 nm (negative) and 229 nm (positive),
which indicated interactions between aromatic chromophores of tryptophan97 (Figure S4). These
bands were not seen at lower concentrations which suggested that the
self-assembly that was obtained at a lower concentration of 0.02 mM
did not involve stacking of the indole rings of tryptophan. The observation
of the exciton-coupled band at high concentrations of the peptide
suggested that some change in self-assembly occurred at high peptide
concentrations involved aromatic stacking of tryptophan side chains.

To probe the self-assembly of the peptide further, we decided to
monitor the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues present
in the peptide. As the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan gets quenched
upon aromatic stacking interactions of the indole rings during self-assembly,
this study is immensely important in monitoring the self-assembly
driven by aromatic stacking of tryptophan. Upon increasing the concentration
of the peptide, the fluorescence intensity at 345 nm steadily increased
till 0.156 mM, beyond which the fluorescence intensity got quenched
upon increasing the concentration (Figure 6). This suggested that aromatic stacking
of indole rings occurred beyond 0.156 mM and was absent at lower concentrations.
These data corroborated the CD data and suggested that the self-assembly
into nanospheres at a low concentration of 0.02 mM was not assisted
by tryptophan stacking. With increase in the concentration of the
peptide, not only did the size of the peptide nanospheres increase
as seen by DLS, but a significant change in the self-assembly pattern
also occurred, which involved aromatic stacking of tryptophan.

Studies on Binding/Encapsulation of Dye Carboxyfluorescein and
Hydrophobic Drug Curcumin to the Peptide Microspheres
Here,
we examined the peptide nanospheres as an in vitro model for delivery
of the hydrophobic fluorescent drug curcumin as well as the dye carboxyfluorescein.
The interaction of the dye and the drug molecules with the peptide
was studied using the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the dye/drug
molecules. Figure 7a,b shows the fluorescence emission spectrum of carboxyfluorescein
and curcumin, respectively, upon being incubated with the peptide
solution (0.02 mM). Initially, after the addition of the dye/drug
to the peptide solution, the fluorescence emission of the dye/drug
was quenched, which indicated the interaction of the dye/drug with
the peptide. The fluorescence kept steadily decreasing over time till
about 6 h for carboxyfluorescein and 36 h for curcumin and stayed
stable till 48 h (not shown in the figure). Upon the addition of KCl,
the fluorescence emission of carboxyfluorescein/curcumin increased
again. This might be a consequence of the release of the dye molecules
due to disruption of peptide nanospheres upon the addition of KCl.
Disruption of nanospheres in the presence of KCl has already been
demonstrated earlier with FESEM (Figure 3c). The recovery of fluorescence in the case
of carboxyfluorescein was almost 100%, as KCl seemed to have very
little effect on it (Figure S5a). However,
in the case of curcumin, the recovery of the fluorescence intensity
was not 100%, as in the presence of KCl, the fluorescence of curcumin
was modified, as shown in Figure S5b. Upon
the addition of HCOOH to the peptide solution containing curcumin,
the fluorescence emission of curcumin increased, confirming the release
of the dye upon disruption of nanospheres, as was previously seen
with the FESEM study (Figure 3d).

Figure 7 Time-dependent fluorescence spectra of (a) carboxyfluorescein and
(b) curcumin upon being added to 0.02 mM solution of P. The effect
of the addition of KCl and HCOOH to the carboxyfluorescein/curcumin–peptide
solution has also been studied.

The peptide–carboxyfluorescein interaction was also
studied
using fluorescence microscopy. Figure 8a shows the bright-field image of the peptide nanospheres
at the 0.02 mM peptide concentration. Figure 8b is the fluorescence image of the dye; it
shows localization at certain zones. Figure 8c is the superimposition of the two earlier
images which demonstrates the co-localization of dye carboxyfluorescein
and the peptide nanospheres. However, this picture does not explain
whether the peptide is surface-bound or entrapped within the nanospheres. Figure 8d shows the loss
of localization/scattering of carboxyfluorescein upon the addition
of KCl which is an effect of the disruption of the vesicles upon the
addition of KCl, which is already proved by FESEM (Figure 3c). This disruption of peptide
self-assembly leads to the loss of interactions between the peptide
and carboxyfluorescein, which explains the increase in the fluorescence
emission of the dye, as seen by fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure 7a).

of carboxyfluorescein. (a) Bright-field image, (b) fluorescence image,
(c) superposition of (a,b), and (d) fluorescence image upon the addition
of KCl.

Next, we formed the nanospheres
in the presence of curcumin (Figure 9a) and monitored
the fluorescence emission of curcumin at different time points (Figure 9b). In this scenario,
a lot of dye was encapsulated inside the nanospheres. Interestingly,
this time, the fluorescence intensity of curcumin did not diminish
appreciably, unlike in the earlier case where curcumin solution was
added to the peptide solution, that is, to the already formed nanospheres
(Figure 7b). This result
suggested that curcumin was not entrapped within the nanospheres,
but was rather surface-bound in the earlier case. As interactions
of curcumin with the surface of the nanospheres led to appreciable
quenching of fluorescence, it may be argued that the surface of the
nanospheres contained some aromatic groups that interacted with aromatic
moieties of curcumin (Figure S6). This
suggested that tryptophan side chains stick out on the outer surface
of the nanospheres formed at the 0.02 mM peptide concentration. When
curcumin was entrapped inside the nanospheres, there was a slight
fluorescence quenching, indicating that the inside of the nanospheres
did not have aromatic groups to interact with curcumin. The slight
decrease in the fluorescence intensity may have occurred because of
the untrapped curcumin molecules in solution that interacted with
the tryptophan residues on the surface. This is a clear hint that
the interior of nanospheres did not contain any indole moieties of
tryptophan but contained leucine side chains instead. Thus, the drug
encapsulation studies proved a good way to indirectly understand the
self-assembled morphology of P. Upon the addition of KCl and formic
acid to the curcumin-entrapped nanospheres, the fluorescence emission
of curcumin changed significantly. This was due to the rupture of
the microspheres releasing the encapsulated and bound curcumin. This
changed fluorescence of curcumin was similar to that observed earlier
upon the release of surface-bound curcumin. Figure S7 shows the FESEM image of freeze-dried curcumin-loaded nanospheres
upon resuspension in EtOH, and Figure S8a,b shows the FESEM image of rupture of the curcumin-loaded nanospheres
in the presence of KCl and HCOOH that validates the change in fluorescence
emission of curcumin, as seen in Figure 9b. Furthermore, to prove that curcumin was
indeed encapsulated in the microspheres, we analyzed the contents
using mass spectrometry after disruption of the peptide microspheres
in the presence of KCl. The presence of curcumin mass in Figure 9d, of the KCl-ruptured
curcumin-loaded peptide microspheres with KCl, clearly proved that
curcumin was entrapped in the microspheres (Figure S9).

Figure 9 (a) FESEM image of peptide nanospheres formed in the presence of
curcumin. (b) Time-dependent fluorescence spectra of curcumin upon
the addition of freeze-dried P (final conc. 0.02 mM) to curcumin solution.
The effect of the addition of KCl and HCOOH to the curcumin–peptide
solution has also been studied.

To understand the microsphere morphologies at the 10 mM peptide
concentration, curcumin was added to the peptide microspheres formed
at 10 mM, and its fluorescence emission was monitored and compared
with the data obtained upon the addition of curcumin to peptide solution
at 0.02 mM (Figure 10a). Figure 10b shows
the quenching of curcumin fluorescence with time, indicating the interaction
of the peptide with dye, suggesting that even at the 10 mM concentration
of the peptide, the microspheres had tryptophan sticking out of the
surface just like in the case of P nanospheres formed at 0.02 mM.
To ensure that the binding of curcumin to the surface of nanospheres
was indeed through aromatic interactions between the aromatic moiety
of the drug and the indole ring of tryptophan, fluorescence emission
of Trp upon the addition of curcumin to preformed nano-assemblies
at both 0.02 mM (Figure 10c) and 10 mM (Figure 10d) was monitored. In both the cases, quenching of tryptophan
fluorescence was observed, proving that curcumin was indeed surface-bound
to the nano-/microspheres by aromatic interactions between the tryptophan
side chains and the aromatic moieties present in the drug (Figure S6).

Mechanism of Self-Assembly
Tetrapeptide Boc-Trp-Leu-Trp-Leu-OMe
spontaneously self-assembled into spherical nano-/microspheres upon
dissolution in EtOH, as seen from FESEM. On the basis of the experiments
described above and the energy-optimized structure of the peptide
(Figure 1b), it was
possible to understand the mechanism of self-assembly of the tetrapeptide. Figure 11 is a schematic
which attempts to explain the mechanism of concentration-dependent
self-assembly of the tetrapeptide. From the energy-minimized structure
of the peptide, the orientation of the tryptophan ring was seen to
be roughly about perpendicular to the plane containing the peptide
bond. From FTIR, the peptide was found to adopt anti-parallel β
sheet conformation. When peptide strands hydrogen-bonded to form anti-parallel
β sheets, the tryptophan residues pointed toward one side of
the β sheet and the leucine side chains pointed toward the opposite
side (Figure 11b).
The tryptophan aromatic rings were poised in such a fashion that they
did not stack with each other upon forming the anti-parallel β
sheet. Thus, even upon forming the anti-parallel β sheet, the
intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan in the peptides increased proportionately
with the concentration. This peptide sheet folded to form the nanospheres
which were seen in FESEM at as low as 0.02 mM concentration (Figure 11c). These nanospheres
were formed in such a way that the Trp side chains pointed outwards
while the hydrophobic leucine side chains pointed inwards. The formation
of nanospheres at the 0.02 mM concentration did not need the aromatic
stacking of tryptophan and was driven by the hydrophobic effect. Because
of the low concentration, the nanospheres remained discrete and did
not cluster with each other (Figure 3a). Upon increasing the concentration of the peptide,
self-assembly via the above mentioned mode continued and the size
of the nanospheres increased by fusion of the smaller spheres forming
larger spheres (microspheres), as seen by DLS studies (Figure 5). Beyond a certain concentration
(0.156 mM), the microspheres came close together and formed clusters
of microspheres (Figure 11d). This clustering was stabilized by aromatic interactions
of tryptophan side chains pointing out of the microspheres. This led
to quenching of tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence (Figure 6a) and appearance of exciton-coupled
CD peaks (Figure S4) upon increasing the
concentration of the peptide beyond 0.156 mM. The proximity of the
microspheres at higher concentrations is seen in the FESEM images
at 10 mM (Figure 2d). Figure 11E–G indicates
surface binding and encapsulation of curcumin at different peptide
concentrations.

on at the surface of P nanospheres, and (G) binding of curcumin on
at the surface of P microspheres at 10 mM.

Quantification of Drug Loading
Our peptide microspheres
can both intercalate with the drug on the surface as well as encapsulate
it. For the intercalation mode of curcumin binding, drug loading efficiencies
after 24 h at 0.02 and 10 mM of the peptide concentration for 20 μM
of curcumin were 87.5 and 84.2%, respectively (Figure S10b). It was not possible to quantitate the drug encapsulation
for our drug delivery system. This was because when the drug was encapsulated
inside the microspheres, some of the drug was also left unencapsulated
in the medium. This drug immediately intercalated with the tryptophan
on the surface of the microspheres. The species obtained in this case
were peptide microspheres with both drug encapsulation and binding.
Very little amount of drug was left free in the medium, as proved
by mass spectrometry. The fluorescence signal obtained in this case
was due to the fluorescence of the encapsulated drug—fluorescence
quenching due to the surface-bound drug and hence could not be used
to quantitate the amount of the encapsulated drug alone (Figure S10c).

Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion, we have been able to explain the mechanism of self-assembly
of a tetrapeptide containing tryptophan. This is a befitting example
showing how self-assembly is governed by an interplay of several forces.
At the low concentration range, intrastrand hydrogen bonding leads
to the formation of anti-parallel β sheets that are driven to
assemble into unilayered nanospheres by the hydrophobic effect, with
the leucine side chains pointed towards the core of the nanosphere
and tryptophan side chains pointing outwards. Upon increasing the
concentration of the peptide, the size of the peptide spheres increases,
eventually forming unilayered microspheres. Beyond a certain concentration,
clustering of microspheres occur which is stabilized by aromatic stacking
interactions between the tryptophan side chains sticking out of the
microspheres. We have also demonstrated the potential of the nanospheres
to be used as a drug delivery vehicle. When curcumin is added to P
nanospheres, it is intercalated on the surface of the nanospheres
instead of being encapsulated in the spheres. Curcumin interacts with
peptide nanospheres via aromatic interactions between the indole ring
of the tryptophan sticking out of the nanosphere surface and its aromatic
moiety. On the other hand, upon forming the peptide nanospheres in
the presence of curcumin, encapsulation occurs. In both cases, the
drug is released in the presence of physiologically relevant ions
such as potassium and in acidic conditions upon disruption of the
peptide self-assembly. With dual drug encapsulation and intercalation
capabilities, this prototype is definitely a prospective drug delivery
vehicle.

Synthesis of the Peptide (General Procedure)
A racemization-free,
fragment condensation technique-based solution-phase method was employed
for the synthesis of the tetrapeptide (Boc-Trp-Leu-Trp-Leu-OMe). Tertiary
butyloxycarbonyl and the methyl ester group were used for the protection
of amino and carboxyl groups. The Boc group and the ester group were
deprotected using formic acid and saponification reactions, respectively.
Coupling was mediated via EDC·HCl and HOBt. The progress of the
reaction was monitored using thin layer chromatography (TLC). The
final peptide was obtained with high purity by column chromatography
using a silica gel (100–200) mesh as the stationary phase and
a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane in the ratio of 3:2 as the mobile
phase. The peptide was further purified using HPLC for further removal
of any impurities. The synthesized peptide was fully characterized
by the 1H NMR study, mass spectral analysis, and FTIR.

Synthesis of Boc-Protected l-Tryptophan (Boc-W-OH)
l-Tryptophan (20 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in 5 N NaOH,
stirred, and cooled to 0 °C. To the stirring solution, Boc anhydride
(24 mmol, 1.2 equiv) dissolved in 1,4-dioxane was added. The pH of
the reaction was maintained at >12. The reaction mixture was allowed
to stir overnight. Dioxane was evaporated completely over rota vapor.
Water was added to the reaction mixture, washed with ethyl acetate
(3 × 30 mL), and acidified with 6 N HCl (pH = 2). The aqueous
layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL), the organic
layers were pooled and washed with 25% brine solution. The organic
layer was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to
get the Boc-protected l-tryptophan. (Boc-W-OH). The yield

were taken in a round-bottom flask, covered with a calcium chloride
guard tube, and cooled in an ice bath. Into the stirring reaction
mixture, SOCl2 (75 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added dropwise.
The reaction mixture was stirred for another 30 min under ice-cooled
conditions. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 4
h. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was cooled down and then evaporated
to get the methyl ester of l-leucine. The yield of the reaction
was 7.67 g (42.5 mmol, 85%).

Synthesis of Dipeptide Boc-Trp-Leu-OMe
l-OMe·HCl
(15 mmol) was dissolved in a minimum amount of dry DCM (30 mL) to
which 5.9 mL (2.8 equiv) of triethyl amine was added at 0 °C
and stirred for 15 min. This was added to a precooled solution of
Boc-protected tryptophan Boc-W-OH (15 mmol) in dry DCM (30 mL) and
preactivated with EDC·HCl (1.2 equiv) and HOBt (1.2 equiv). After
12 h, the reaction mixture was washed with distilled water and brine
for three times. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate, filtered, and evaporated in vacuum to yield an off-white
solid. The dipeptide was purified with column chromatography using
silica gel as the stationary phase and a mixture of ethyl acetate
and hexane in the ratio of 3:2 as the eluent. The yield of the reaction
was 5.4 g (12.5 mmol, 83.2%). HRMS (ESI-TOF) m/z: (m + H)+ calcd for C23H33N3O5, 432.2493 Da; found, 432.2490 Da (Figure S13). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 600 MHz, δ ppm) (Figure S14): 0.84, 0.9 (d, 3H, J = 6 Hz,

Synthesis of Boc-Trp-Leu-OH
The synthesized dipeptide
Boc-WL-OMe (6.2 mmol, 2.672 g) was dissolved in MeOH, followed by
the dropwise addition of 10 N NaOH till the pH of the reaction was
>12 (mixture turned turbid). The reaction was allowed to stir for
36 h, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After
36 h, the reaction mixture was evaporated. Water was added to the
residue and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL). The aqueous
layer was cooled and acidified with 6 N HCl (pH = 2) and then extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL). The organic layers were pooled,
washed with brine solution, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to obtain the product Boc-WL-OH. The yield of the
reaction was 1.9 g (4.8 mmol, 77.41%).

Synthesis of Peptide Boc-Trp-Leu-Trp-Leu-OMe
Formic
acid (10 mL) was added to the dipeptide Boc-Trp-Leu-OMe (4.8 mmol)
and kept for 3 h. Thereafter, formic acid was completely removed under
pressure. The residue so obtained was taken in water, and the pH of
the solution was adjusted to 11 using sodium bicarbonate and then
extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL). Organic layers were
pooled, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated
to a viscous liquid which responds to the ninhydrine test. The Boc-deprotected
dipeptide (NH2-Trp-Leu-OMe) was dissolved in DCM and triethyl
amine was added to it at 0 °C, and the reaction mixture was stirred
for 15 min. This was added to the precooled Boc-Trp-Leu-OH in dry
DCM, preactivated with EDC·HCl and HOBt. After 72 h, the reaction
was washed with distilled water and brine (3 × 30 mL). The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated
in vacuum to yield an off-white solid. The tetrapeptide was purified
using silica gel as the stationary phase and a mixture of ethyl acetate
and hexane in the ratio of 3:2 as the eluent. Final purification was
done by reverse-phase HPLC using ACN/H2O solvent mixtures.
Tetrapeptide was obtained as a white powder. The yield of the reaction
was 2.0 g (2.8 mmol, 58.1%), mp 154 °C. The peptide purity was
confirmed by analytical HPLC trace (Figure S15) and 1H NMR spectra (Figure S16). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 600 MHz,

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
All nuclear
magnetic resonance studies were carried out on a Bruker Ascend Aeon
600 MHz spectrometer at 298 K. The compound concentrations were in
the range 1–10 mmol in DMSO-d6.

Mass Spectrometry
ESI (positive mode)-HRMS masses were
recorded using Agilent 6520 Accurate Mass Q-TOF LC/MS.

FTIR Spectroscopy
IR spectra were recorded in a KBr
pellet in a PerkinElmer spectrometer in the region of 400–4000
cm–1.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology
of the reported materials was studied by an FESEM Sigma Zeiss Gemini
microscope.(a) For the FESEM study in different solvents,
the lyophilized peptide was incubated for 5 min in different solvents
(acetonitrile, DMSO, toluene, methanol, and ethanol) at a peptide
concentration of 10 mM. The peptide solutions were drop-casted on
a silicon wafer and dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight
(7 days for DMSO solution).

(b) For the morphology study at lower
concentrations, 0.02 mM ethanolic peptide solution was prepared and
after 2 min, 5 μL of this solution was taken out and drop-casted
on a wafer. Another part of the solution was allowed to age for 10
days and 5 μL of the same was drop-casted on a wafer. KCl (20
μL, 0.01 mM) and 50 μL of HCOOH were added to two batches
of 10 days-aged peptide solution (5 mL each), incubated for 48 h,
and drop-casted on a silicon wafer.

c) Lyophilized peptide (1.46 mg) was added
to 100 mL of 20 μM curcumin solution to the final peptide concentration
of 0.02 mM and incubated for 2 days. Five microliters of this solution
was drop-casted on a silicon wafer. Water was added to the peptide
solution, and it was freeze-dried in three batches. One batch was
resuspended in EtOH and to the two other batches, 5 μL of 0.01
mM of KCl and 50 μL of HCOOH were added and incubated for 48
h, and 5 μL of each batch was casted on a wafer.



Field-Emission Transmission Electron Microscopy
FETEM
studies were performed on JEOL JEM (model 2100F) at an operating voltage
of 200 kV by casting 3 μL of 0.02 mM ethanolic solution of the
peptide on carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh). EtOH was removed
by slow evaporation, and the grid was allowed to dry under vacuum
at room temperature for 3 days. Uranyl acetate solution (3 μL)
was added to the grid and dried under vacuum overnight. Images were
taken in both the transmission mode and the diffraction mode.

Atomic
Force Microscopy
All experiments were performed
on Agilent (5500 series). For the AFM study, 5 μL of ethanolic
solution of the peptide (10 mM, 0.02 mM) was placed on a microscope
glass coverslip and dried by slow evaporation under vacuum for 3 days.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The particle size of the peptide
spheres was determined by DLS with corresponding peptide solution
in ethanol at different concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04
mM). The experiment was carried out in Zetasizer Nano ZS90 from Malvern
using a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser at 298 K.

CD Spectroscopy
The CD spectra of all the samples were
recorded by using a 200 μL quartz cuvette of 1 mm path length
with a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Spectra
were collected at a scan rate of 100 nm·min–1 and 2 nm bandwidth from 195 to 260 nm with five scans for averaging.
Before running the sample, ethanol was run to correct the baseline.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
All fluorescence measurements
were performed on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer
using a cuvette of path 1 cm.

Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
of the peptide was monitored to study the peptide self-assembly process.
Emission spectra were recorded for peptide solutions at different
concentrations in between 10 and 0.04 mM at an excitation wavelength
of 280 nm and a slit width of 3.

The peptide microsphere dye/drug
interaction was studied by monitoring
fluorescence emission of dye carboxyfluorescein and drug curcumin.

Peptide–carboxyfluorescein interaction: 5 mL of peptide
solution was mixed with 5 mL of ethanolic carboxyfluorescein solution
to attain the final peptide and carboxyfluorescein concentrations
of 0.02 mM and 90 μM respectively. Emission spectra of carboxyfluorescein
were recorded at different time intervals with an excitation wavelength
of 493 nm and a bandwidth of 5 nm. Finally, after 24 h, 5 μL
of 0.01 mM KCl was added to 5 mL of the above mentioned solution and
incubated for 24 h, and fluorescence was measured. To the other 5
mL of the abovementioned solution, 50 μL of HCOOH was added
and incubated for 24 h, and fluorescence was measured.

Curcumin
peptide interaction: The experiment was done in two different
ways.(1) Lyophilized peptide (1.46 mg) was
added to 100 mL of 20 μM ethanolic solution of curcumin to make
a final peptide concentration of 0.02 mM. Emission spectra with an
excitation of 430 nm and a bandwidth of 5 were recorded at different
time intervals upto 36 h. KCl and HCOOH were added to different portions
of the abovementioned solution as described previously, and fluorescence
was recorded.

2) To ethanolic
peptide solution, curcumin
solution was added to make a final peptide concentration of 0.02 and
10 mM and a final curcumin concentration of 20 μM. Fluorescence
emission was monitored at different time intervals. After 36 h, KCl
and HCOOH were added to different portions of the abovementioned solution
as described previously, and fluorescence was recorded.



Proof of Curcumin Encapsulation
Peptide (10 mM) was
added to 20 μM curcumin solution. The microspheres containing
curcumin were coagulated using water and centrifuged down. The supernatant’s
mass was checked. After several cycles of washes followed by centrifugation,
the precipitate was resuspended in ethanol and water and lyophilized.
Lyophilized microspheres loaded with curcumin were again resuspended
in EtOH, and its mass was checked. Finally, KCl was added to rupture
the microspheres to release curcumin, and mass was checked.

Quantification
of Curcumin Loading
We have quantified
the amount of the drug intercalated (surface bound) using fluorescence
spectroscopy at both the 0.02 and 10 mM peptide concentration. For
intercalation (surface binding), curcumin solution was added to peptide
solution, and fluorescence was measured after 24 h of incubation.
The quenching of curcumin fluorescence was due to surface binding
of the drug to the peptide microspheres. Hence, the fluorescence signal
was obtained from the unbound drug.

Figure S10 in the supplementary shows the standard curve of curcumin
fluorescence and the fluorescence emission experiment done to quantify
the drug loading efficiency. Drug loading efficiency = (amount of
encapsulated drug/amount of injected drug) × 100.

Fluorescence
Microscopy
Ethanolic solution of the peptide
(0.02 mM) was incubated with 50 μM of carboxyfluorescein for
24 h. Then, one drop (10 μL) of this solution was drop-casted
on a cover slide and dried at room temperature under vacuum. The fluorescence
microscopic image was taken with a Nikon eclipse Ts2R fluorescence
microscope. For salt-triggered disruption studies with the spheres,
KCl solution (1 mM 5 μL) was added to the dye solution of the
peptide and incubated for 12 h, and the image was taken subsequently.
