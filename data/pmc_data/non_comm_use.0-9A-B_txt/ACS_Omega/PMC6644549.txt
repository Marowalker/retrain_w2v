Organic–inorganic hybrid material
is a recent hot topic
in the scientific community. The best band gap for the entire solar
absorption spectrum is about 1.1 eV. However, the lead perovskite
band gap is about 1.5 eV. Therefore, developing organic–inorganic
hybrid material toward the broader light harvesting of the solar spectrum
is extremely urgent. In this study, we prepare three kinds of organic–inorganic
hybrid palladium perovskite materials, including (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3, for an optoelectronic response. The absorption cut offs of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 are approximately 600, 700, and 1000 nm, respectively.
The band gaps of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 are determined to be approximately
2.15, 1.87, and 1.25 eV, respectively. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study that discusses adsorption properties and photoelectric
behavior of organic–inorganic hybrid palladium perovskite materials.
Interestingly, the photoelectric response of the devices based on
CH3NH3PdI3 reaches 950 nm. The results
will attract attention in the fields of optical recorders, optical
memory, security, light capture, and light treatment.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic
hybrid material is a recent hot topic
in the scientific community. Especially, organic–inorganic
lead perovskite materials show good physical and chemical properties.
They are widely used in many fields such as solar cells,1,2 photoconductivity and electroluminescence,3 light-emitting diode,4−6 field-effect transistor,7,8 and
so on. The most successful study is the application of organic–inorganic
lead perovskite for solar cells. Power conversion efficiency (PCE)
of lead-perovskite-based solar cells is boosted to 22%.9 Their performance has still room for improvement.
One important direction to improve their performance is to broaden
the spectral absorption. The best band gap of a semiconductor for
the entire solar absorption spectrum is about 1.1 eV. However, the
lead perovskite band gap is about 1.5 eV.10 One of the strategies to broaden the spectral absorption is to make
a tandem solar cell. Buonassisi group,11 Buecheler group,12 and Shen group13 carried out research on a tandem solar cell
by stacking MAPbI3 perovskite and silicon solar cells.
In addition, Snaith14 and Baikie15 expanded the absorption spectrum to 840 nm by
replacing a methylammonium cation with a formamidinium cation. Ma16 extended absorption spectrum by replacing lead
metal ions with bismuth metal ions. Multiabsorption was observed in
the composite film because of the band gap difference between BiI3 and (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskite. The crystal structures of CsPdCl317 and CsPd2Cl518 have been investigated by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) methods. However, photoelectric response of the palladium perovskite
materials has not been reported.

In this article, we synthesize
three kinds of organic–inorganic
hybrid palladium perovskite materials, including (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3. Among them, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx are two-dimensional
layered structures. CH3NH3PdI3 is
a three-dimensional structure. The structure of CH3NH3PdI3 is very similar to that of MAPbI3. In addition, we study the spectral properties, crystal structures,
nanomicrostructures, and photoelectric responses of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3.

Results and Discussion
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films are
shown in Figure 1a.
The colors of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films
are pale-yellow, red-brown, and dark-brown, respectively. To determine
the structures of these films, we measured the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
profiles of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films. XRD results of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films on TiO2 are shown in Figure 1b. To determine the
structural phase of the (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film, a (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 single crystal was synthesized by slowly
evaporating a mixed precursor of PdCl2 and CH3NH3Cl in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Single-crystal
diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart CCD diffractometer
with the use of Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å).
The structures were solved by a direct method and expanded using difference
Fourier techniques with the SHELXL-97 program. The single-crystal
diffraction data, which revealed the two-dimensional layered structure
of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, were
assigned to the orthorhombic crystal system (space group = P212121, unit cell parameters
of a = 7.4417(7) Å, b = 7.7401(8)
Å, c = 18.2596(18) Å, α = 90.000,
β = 90.000, and γ = 90.000). A unit cell contains one
molecule with the chemical formula of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4. Detailed crystal data and structural
refinement for the (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 single crystals can be observed in the Supporting Information. The experimental patterns are consistent
with calculated curves from single-crystal diffraction data, as shown
in Figure 1b. Two diffraction
peaks of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 are observed at 8.85 and 16.39°, which are assigned to the
(002) and (111) planes, respectively. Two diffraction peaks of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx are also observed at 8.48 and
27.61°. By comparing with the XRD pattern of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, the diffraction peak assigned
to the crystal plane (002) in (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx is found to have shifted from 8.85 to 8.48°. The result indicates
that the (002) lattice spacing of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx becomes larger. This is mainly because that the Cl atoms
in the unit cell are replaced by Br atoms with a larger atomic radius.
The XRD pattern of CH3NH3PdI3 is
shown in Figure 1b.
Two obvious diffraction peaks can be clearly seen at 14.64 and 29.60°.
XRD patterns of CH3NH3PdI3 are very
close to those of CH3NH3PdI3. Typically,
XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film
appear at 14.12° (110) and 28.44° (220). Thus, the main
diffraction peaks of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 at 14.64 and 29.60° can be assigned to the (110) and
(220), respectively. To characterize the optical properties of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
was carried out. The UV–vis absorption spectra of these thin
films are shown in Figure 1c. Two absorption peaks of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film are observed at 420 and 491 nm.
The absorbance of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film is decreased quickly from 420 nm. The absorption
peak of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film is observed
at 494 nm. The absorption intensity of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film begins to decrease at 494 nm. The
hump Q peak for all three materials appearing at 490 nm may be originated
from charge-transfer transition from d orbitals.19 The absorption intensity of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film (600 nm) is higher than that of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film (600
nm). The absorption peak of CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is observed at 491 nm. Absorption intensity begins to
decrease at 678 nm. Amazingly, the absorption of CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is cut off at the near-infrared
region (about 950 nm). To characterize the reflection properties of
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films, diffuse reflection spectroscopy was carried
out. Diffuse reflection spectra of these thin films are shown in Figure 1d. The reflection
intensity of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film begins to increase obviously at 420 nm. The reflection
intensity of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film also is
increased significantly at 420 nm. The reflectivity of CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is increased from 678 nm.
However, the reflectivity of CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is weaker than those of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin films in the range of 548–1000 nm. To obtain the band
gaps of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3, the diffuse reflectance spectrum was
converted into the Kubelka–Munk spectrum. According to the
Kubelka–Munk formula, F(R) = (1 – R)2/2R, where R represents the percentage of reflection.
The relationship of the incident photon energy (hν) and Eg can be expressed as the
transformed Kubelka–Munk, [F(R)·hν]p = A (hv – Eg), where Eg is the band-gap energy, A is the absorption constant, h is Planck’s
constant, ν is the frequency of the light (S–1), and P is the power index that is related to the
optical absorption process. Theoretically, P equals
to 1/2 or 2 for an indirect or a direct allowed transition, respectively.
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 can be regarded as a direct allowed transition. The
band gaps of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 are shown in Figure 1e. The band gap of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 is 2.15 eV, which is consistent
with the results in the literature.20 The
band gap of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx is 1.87 eV, which
is smaller than that of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4. The band gap of CH3NH3PdI3 is 1.25 eV, which is smaller than those of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx.

To study the morphologies
of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films, we
carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The results
are shown in Figure 2. The SEM images of the surface of FTO/TiO2/(CH3NH3)2PdCl4 device are shown in Figure 2a,b. We can see that
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4 is a two-dimensional
layered structure. The horizontal size of two-dimensional (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 is about 2 μm.
The SEM images of the surface of FTO/TiO2/(CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx device are shown in Figure 2c,d. It can be clearly observed
that the coverage of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin
film on the TiO2 thin film is not good and the distribution
is not uniform. The inferior quality of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film will result in a relatively poor
photoelectrical response. The high-magnification SEM image of the
surface of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx is shown in Figure 2d. The SEM images
of the surface of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PdI3 device are shown in Figure 2e,f. The morphology of CH3NH3PdI3 is similar to a semicircular sphere assembled
by a large number of small particles. Its diameter is between 1 and
2 μm.

To determine the elemental distribution of CH3NH3PdI3 thin film, we conducted elemental mapping
analysis by SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The SEM image of the
surface of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PdI3 device is shown in Figure 3a. The blue-green area in Figure 3b is the surface distribution of carbon.
Compared with that in Figure 3a, carbon is mainly distributed in the area where CH3NH3PdI3 is present. However, other areas also
have some carbon. This may be because that the CH3NH3PdI3 thin film adsorbs carbon dioxide in the air.
The dark-red area in Figure 3c is the surface distribution of nitrogen. The bright-green
area in Figure 3d is
the distribution of chlorine. A very small amount of chlorine is present
on the surface of CH3NH3PdI3 because
of the presence of chlorine in the raw materials we used. The bright-yellow
area in Figure 3e is
the distribution of iodine. Iodine is distributed in the area where
CH3NH3PdI3 is present. The bright-purple
area in Figure 3f is
the distribution of palladium. The distribution of palladium is almost
the same as the distribution of iodine. To determine the elemental
composition of CH3NH3PdI3, we performed
SEM-EDX in spot mode. The results are shown in Figure 3g,h. CH3NH3PdI3 obviously contains C, N, Pd, and I elements. The atomic ratio
of C, N, Pd, and I is 2:5:1:3. The number of Pd and I atoms matches
the formula of CH3NH3PdI3. However,
the number of C and N atoms is higher than that in the formula of
CH3NH3PdI3. It may be because the
N2 and CO2 in the air were adsorbed on the surface
of the CH3NH3PdI3 thin film during
the measurement. To analyze the thickness of each layer of the FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PdI3 device and the
uniformity of the film, we recorded the SEM image of the cross section
of the FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PdI3 device. The SEM images are shown in Figure 4a,b. CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is uniformly covered on the TiO2 film.
The thickness of the CH3NH3PdI3 thin
film is from 667 to 906 nm. In addition, CH3NH3PdI3 diffused into the porous TiO2 films, which
is favorable for an interface electron transfer. The thickness of
dense TiO2 film is 68 nm. The thickness of the porous TiO2 film is 218 nm.

(c) Photocurrent
density on/off curves of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx,
and CH3NH3PdI3 under a standard solar
simulator (100 mW cm–2) with an AM 1.5G filter.

To compare the photoelectric responses
of the devices based on
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3, the on/off curves of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 under
AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2 simulated illumination were
compared, as shown in Figure 4c. The photocurrent density of the device based on (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film is slowly
increased with the increase in light time exposure, and without the
light, it is slowly reduced with the increasing time. This phenomenon
indicates that the device based on (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 thin film is sensitive to light. The photocurrent
density of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film is weak.
The reason may be that the coverage of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx thin film on the TiO2 thin film
is not good, as shown in Figure 2c. The photocurrent density of the device based on
CH3NH3PdI3 thin film is increased
rapidly under the light irradiation. Without the light, the photocurrent
density is decreased rapidly with the increasing time. This phenomenon
indicates that the CH3NH3PdI3 thin
film is more photosensitive than (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx.

To investigate the monochromatic photoresponses of the devices,
we examined the photocurrent responses of the devices based on (CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3 thin films at different wavelengths. The chopper
frequency of monochromatic light is 1.33 Hz. The photocurrent-density
on/off curves of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 device at different wavelengths are shown in Figure 5a. The on/off curve of the
photocurrent density does not show periodic changes under 300, 400,
and 500 nm monochromatic light. Also, the contrast between Jon (current density under irradiation) and Joff (current density under the dark) is not
obvious. Some periodic changes are observed in the photocurrent-density
on/off curves when irradiated with monochromatic light of 330 nm.
However, the periodic change is not very strong. The photocurrent-density
on/off curves of the devices based on(CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx at different wavelengths are shown in Figure 5b. The on/off curve
of the photocurrent density does not exhibit a periodic change when
irradiated with monochromatic light at 300, 400, 500, and 800 nm.
Compared with that of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 devices, a strong periodic change in the photocurrent-density
on/off curve is observed when irradiated with 330 nm monochromatic
light. The photocurrent-density on/off curves of the devices based
on CH3NH3PdI3 at different wavelengths
are shown in Figure 5c. Figure 5d is a
magnified graph of the dashed part of Figure 5c. Compared with that of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, the photocurrent-density on/off curve of the
devices based on CH3NH3PdI3 has a
strong periodic change when irradiated with 330 nm monochromatic light.
Also, the contrast between Jon and Joff is most obvious. Figure 5c shows that the photocurrent-density on/off
curve has a strong periodic change when irradiated with 300, 600,
800, and 900 nm monochromatic light. Compared with the on/off signal
at 300 nm, on/off signals at 600, 800, and 900 nm are relatively large.
The on/off curve at 950 nm photocurrent still has a periodic change,
but the periodic variation is weak. This periodic change disappears
beyond 1000 nm. Generally, the photoelectric response is up to about
800 nm for MAPbI3 perovskite. Interestingly, the photoelectric
response of the devices based on CH3NH3PdI3 reaches 950 nm. Light harvesting of the solar spectrum based
on CH3NH3PdI3 is wider than those
of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 and
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx. Therefore, CH3NH3PdI3 can be used as a near-infrared
absorption material in the fields of optical recorders, optical memory,
security, light capture, and light treatment.

Conclusions
We synthesize organic-–inorganic palladium
perovskite materials
(CH3NH3)2PdCl4, (CH3NH3)2PdCl4–xBrx, and CH3NH3PdI3, whose spectral absorption cut offs are approximately
600, 700, and 1000 nm, respectively. The photoelectric response of
the devices based on CH3NH3PdI3 reaches
the near-infrared region. Although palladium perovskite materials
have a good band gap, and near-infrared and strong photoelectric response,
they are expensive. Therefore, we are studying perovskite materials
with reduced content of palladium by mixing with other metals.

Experimental
Section
Growth of (CH3NH3)2PdCl4 Single Crystals
202.5 mg of CH3NH3Cl and 177 mg of PdCl2 were dissolved in 1 mL of
DMF solution. The mixed solution was heated to 80 °C and maintained
at a constant temperature for 2 h using an oil bath. Then, the above
solution was transferred to an 80 °C oven. The single crystal
was observed by slow solvent evaporation (from 80 to 40 °C over
4 d).

Fabrication of FTO/TiO2/Organic–Inorganic
Hybrid Palladium Perovskite/Carbon Electrode Devices
Glass/FTO/C-TiO2/M-TiO2 were prepared following our previous procedures.21 202 mg of CH3NH3Cl, 177
mg of PdCl2; 335 mg of CH3NH3Br,
177 mg of PdCl2; and 477 mg of CH3NH3I, 177 mg of PdCl2 were added into three glass vial, respectively.
DMF (1 mL) was added to each vial. The vials were placed on a hot
plate to heat the solutions (the temperature of the hot plate was
set to 80 °C). After heating for 10 min, a clean and dry magnet
was added to each vial for magnetic stirring. Finally, the solution
in the vial was filtered with a filter head. The mixed solution was
spin-coated on Glass/FTO/C-TiO2/M-TiO2. Then,
FTO/TiO2/organic–inorganic hybrid palladium perovskite
materials were placed on a hot plate (80 °C) and heated for 30
min. Carbon electrodes were prepared following our previous procedures.17

Nanostructures of the film were analyzed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SEM S-4800). UV–vis
absorption spectra and diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using
a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, λ, 750S).
The photocurrent–time performance was measured using an electrochemical
workstation system (CHI760, Chenhua, and Shanghai) and a solar simulator
(IV5, PV Measurements, Inc.). The photocurrent–time performance
with monochromatic light was measured by an electrochemical workstation
system (CHI760, Chenhua, and Shanghai) and measurement system of the
incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (QEX10, PV
Measurements, Inc.). Powder XRD profiles were measured using PANalyticalX́Pert
diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation at λ = 1.54 Å) sampling
at 2°/min, 40 ekV, and 100 mA. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
profiles were measured on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with the
use of Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å).
