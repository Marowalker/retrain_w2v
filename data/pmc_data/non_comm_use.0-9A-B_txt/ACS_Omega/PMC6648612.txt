Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) display excellent plasmonic properties,
which are expected to assist fluorescence enhancement for dyes, and
the phenomenon is known as “metal-enhanced fluorescence”
(MEF). In this study, we demonstrate AuNP-induced MEF for a modified
bipyridine-based construct 4-(pyridine-2-yl)-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]quinoline (PPQ) when it binds with biologically important
Zn2+. Importantly, this phenomenon is observed under aqueous
conditions in a biocompatible bilayer vesicle platform. When PPQ binds
with Zn2+ to form the complex in the presence of appropriate
AuNPs, MEF is evident once compared with the fluorescence intensity
in the absence of AuNPs. Among the three different sizes of AuNPs
used, the enhancement is observed with an average diameter of 33 nm,
whereas 18 and 160 nm do not show any enhancement. A possible mechanism
is ascribed to the radiating plasmons of the AuNPs, which can couple
with the emission frequencies of the fluorophore under a critical
distance-dependent arrangement. We witness that the enhancement in
fluorescence is accompanied with a reduction in lifetime components.
It is proposed that the mechanism may be predominantly derived from
the enhancement of an intrinsic radiative decay rate and partly from
the localized electric field effect. Overall, this work shows a rational
approach to design fluorophore–metal configurations with the
desired emissive properties and a basis for a useful nanophotonic
technology under biological conditions.

1 Introduction
Recently, metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF)1−3 has been recognized
as a popular method by the scientific community, which has led to
new developments and applications by improving the photoluminescence
intensity of variety of materials, such as quantum dots, dyes, lanthanide
nanocrystals, carbon dots, and so forth.4−6 It is a common belief
that metals quench the fluorescence when the emitters are very close
to the metals. However, in MEF, when the fluorophores or emitters
are placed in close proximity but to an optimum distance from the
metallic nanostructures, mainly silver or gold, they are benefitted
by the additional plasmon-enhanced optical fields. The observed augmented
fluorescence intensity is credited to the local field enhancement
associated with the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) in the metal nanostructures. Most importantly, the coupling
between the frequencies emitted by the fluorophore and the plasmon
resonance of the metal particle causes the metal to radiate light
(with enhanced intensity) at the same frequency. The plasmonic nanoparticle
here serves as a transmitting optical antenna to transfer the near
field to the far field at the fluorescence wavelength. Although many
comprehensive works are available in the literature,1−4 we still believe that the far-reaching capability of MEF is still
untested. Because most of the studies and their applications are mainly
accomplished using solid substrates such as metal films, periodic
nanoparticle arrays, and so forth, the MEF studies in aqueous solutions
are limited.7

Considering this, the
current work exploits the gold nanoparticle
(AuNP)-induced plasmonic enhancement of the fluorophore 4-(pyridine-2-yl)-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]quinoline (PPQ) and its
Zn2+ complex in a carefully accomplished bilayer structure
of a “niosome”. Niosome8−14 is an important class of pharmaceutical nanocarriers made up of
nonionic surfactants, which find many diverse applications in the
area of nanomedicine especially in the transdermal drug delivery systems.
They mimic synthetic biological membranes just like liposomes;15 that is, it comprises a “bilayer”
and a “water pool”, which can suitably entrap both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic dyes, respectively, to our advantage. Here, we demonstrate
that the fluorescence intensity of the PPQ–Zn2+–PPQ
(PZP) complex is significantly enhanced to ∼3-fold, if they
are confined in close proximity of AuNPs of appropriate size. Entrapment
of PZP has been performed in Span 80 niosome. Meanwhile, in earlier
reports from our group,16,17 we have established
that PPQ forms a 2:1 complex with Zn2+ (PZP) in an aqueous
micellar and niosome environment.

Evidently, a key point in
MEF is the molecule (emitter)–nanoparticle
distance; by varying the distance, Novotny and co-workers showed a
continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence
quenching,18 using a scanning probe microscope.
On the other hand, Alivisatos et al. and Aslan et al. have evidenced
“quenching” of the molecular emission, when a molecule
was “directly” attached to the metal surface.19,20 Riding on these ideas and with the developments in nanoparticle
synthesis throughout the last decade, noble metal nanoparticles with
different morphologies have been designed and used as flexible substrates
in MEF.6,21−29 Generally, core–shell structures are preferred to acquire
a better MEF effect. They are composed of noble metal nanostructures
such as a metal core or a shell, with a certain thickness of the dielectric
layer including silica or a polymer and a luminescent species. To
name a few, the core–shell technology was successfully implemented
by Geddes and co-workers20 and Halas group,21,22 where they have evidenced enhanced molecular fluorescence of the
dyes adsorbed on the silica layer (shell), few nanometers away from
the Ag and Au surfaces (core). Meanwhile, Aroca and Guerrero introduced
the shell-isolated nanoparticle in MEF, in which the isolated nanoparticle
consists of a metal core and a compact dielectric shell.26,27 However, most of these substrates require multiple synthetic steps
with a highly accurate fabrication process in the nanoscale range.
Moreover, most of them are not suitable for MEF applications under
biological conditions. Therefore, biocompatible platforms for MEF
will be of great demand. In the current study (Scheme 1), we have implemented a strategy based on
the core–shell technique to form an adduct between the PZP
molecules in the bilayer while the AuNPs remain outside the bilayer.
This is made possible through electrostatic interactions of positively
and negatively charged surfaces of the niosome and AuNPs, respectively.
However, AuNPs stay at an optimum distance from the fluorophore because
of the presence of the few nanometer-thick organic bilayer. There
are many reports available in the literature on MEF in biosensors,
which are mostly done on two-dimensional planar, solid MEF platforms.30 However, in this case, we demonstrate the MEF
effect in the AuNP–niosome hybrid system, most importantly
in bulk aqueous conditions.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram Demonstrating the
Possible MEF between the Reporter
Molecule PZP and the AuNPs in Span 80 Niosome
The observed MEF is a result of the coupling of the radiating
plasmons
(RP) of the AuNPs with the excited fluorophore complex PZP. It crucially
also depends on the scattering profile for each metal, and scattering
is a sensitive function of the shape, size, and environment of the
nanostructure. From the three different average sizes of ∼18,
33, and 160 nm AuNPs, we have observed that the optimum size of the
AuNPs to deliver the MEF effect is ∼33 nm. Furthermore, according
to the associated reduction in lifetime components along with the
enhancement, we propose that the enhanced fluorescence intensity is
primarily derived from the intrinsic radiative decay rate enhancement
of PZP and may be partly from the localized electric field effect.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 FE-SEM Studies of the Niosomes
and ET(30) Studies of the Fluorophores
The
synthesized vesicles (niosomes) were first structurally characterized
using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique (Figure 1a). They were immediately formed,
as the dry nonionic surfactant films swell in excess water under vigorous
vortex mixing for 5–6 min. Further, the entrapment of a particular
fluorophore in a niosome depends on the polarity of the molecule,
such that it is partitioned between the hydrophobic bilayer and the
interfacial water pool region. The bilayer structures of Span niosomes
are clearly evident in Figure S9. Consequently,
the location of the fluorophore in the niosome becomes absolutely
crucial for the outcome of the MEF experiment, as an optimum distance
between the metal and the fluorophore is the prerequisite to accomplish
the process. Hence, we have investigated the location of the fluorophore
by performing ET(30) studies.11,31 The details can be found in the Experimental Section. Depending on the polarity of the dyes, ET(30) values are the indicators of the specific regions, where the
dyes are present in the niosome. The determination of ET(30) values for PPQ and its complex PZP in amphiphilic
surfactant medium assisted invaluably in understanding the location
of the fluorophores in the niosome environment (Figure 2). For free PPQ, the ET(30) value was found to be 50.14 kcal/mol, which indicated
that PPQ probably resided in the core hydrophobic bilayer region of
the niosome. On the contrary, the ET(30)
value for PZP was found to be 61.32 kcal/mol, indicating that the
complex formation mostly occurred in the air–water interface
regions of the niosome, where the percentage of the water content
was much more than that in the hydrophobic bilayer area. This was
not completely unanticipated as there was probably no net electrostatic
attraction for the zinc ions toward the core bilayer region of the
neutral niosome, and as a result, most of the complex formation happens
at the air–water interface of the vesicle, suggesting a higher ET(30) value.

nm.

2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization of the AuNPs
Once the vesicles were
synthesized and characterized, we prepared
and characterized the nanoparticles before performing the MEF studies
of PZP. Among noble metal nanostructures, Ag and Au are the popular
choices because of their high plasmonic activity in the visible region.32 We limit this report by mentioning the MEF produced
by the AuNPs only. We prepared the AuNPs of three different average
sizes, namely, 18, 33, and 160 nm. The size and morphology of the
prepared AuNPs were characterized by SEM techniques (Figure 3), while dynamic light scattering
(DLS) reconfirmed the size distribution obtained from SEM. The extinction
spectra (Figure 3a)
of the AuNPs were also recorded using UV–visible spectrophotometry.
Very importantly, it was observed that the plasmonic bands of the
AuNPs shifted continually toward the red region and they were broadened,
as the size of the AuNPs increased from 18 to 160 nm. This red shift
of the plasmonic band also confirmed the progressive increase in the
size of the AuNPs. The number densities of the produced AuNPs were
1.16 × 1013, 1.33 × 1012, and 1.17
× 1010 for 18, 33, and 160 nm, respectively (calculation
S1 in the Supporting Information). The
SEM image for the 160 nm AuNPs can be found in Figure S14.

nm AuNPs, respectively. The inset shows the size distribution. (d)

2.3 MEF Studies and Analysis
To demonstrate
MEF, we recorded and compared the fluorescence emission spectra of
PZP, encapsulated in niosome, with and without the addition of AuNPs.
Upon excitation at 340 nm, PZP exhibited a fluorescence emission maximum
at 450 nm (Figure 4). However, the striking fact was significant ∼3-fold enhancement
in emission intensity, followed by the addition of 33 nm AuNPs (Figure 4), whereas we witnessed
an unchanged intensity with 160 nm and quenched, lower fluorescence
intensity with 18 nm AuNP additions. Similar fluorescence enhancement
was observed when we repeated the same study by encapsulating PZP
in Span 60 niosomes (Figure S6). Span 80
and Span 60 contain equal number of carbon atoms (17) in their hydrophobic
chains except the fact that there is an unsaturation at the eighth
carbon for Span 80, making the chain depart from linearity.11 We suggest that the enhanced fluorescence with
33 nm AuNPs was definitely due to the MEF effect, enforced by the
AuNPs under a suitable structural arrangement around the vesicle,
as shown in Scheme 1. It is known that the core of the bilayer is hydrophobic in nature,
but the interfacial part is hydrophilic because of water penetration.
The fluorophore complex PZP probably remained very close to the membrane–water
interface of the bilayer, and they formed the “core”,
whereas AuNPs were adhered close to the outermost surface of the vesicle
but separated by the head group “spacer” or “shell”
of the bilayer.

Figure 4 Emission spectra of PZP encapsulated inside the Span 80
niosome
in the presence of 160, 33, and 18 nm AuNPs, when excited at 340 nm.

The adhesion of AuNPs to the vesicle
membrane was apparent as can
be seen in Figure 1b–d, as they preferred to stay in the air–water interface
area because of their larger size. Also, Figure S13 evidently confirms the adhesion of the AuNPs on the niosome
surface, when SEM images of niosomes were collected and compared with
and without the addition of AuNPs. Possibly, the governing factor
in this case was the electrostatic attraction between the negatively
charged citrate-capped AuNPs (negative zeta potential value) and the
positively charged surface of the niosomes (positive zeta potential
value). See Figure S5 for more details.
Moreover, this observed MEF effect in solution phase is even more
significant, as it has to overturn the unfavorable effect caused by
random orientations of PZP as these random orientations of the molecules
in solution make it difficult to account for the proper interactions
with nanoparticles at any given time. To confirm, we performed a steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy measurement for both PPQ and PZP complexes
inside niosomes (Figure S8) and no significant
anisotropy (r) values suggested a completely random
molecular motion in the bilayer. Also, a similar enhancement pattern
was observed for both Span 60 and Span 80 niosomes across different
excitation wavelengths, when we performed an excitation wavelength-dependent
study (Figure S7).

As revealed by
the earlier reports, the distance between the fluorophore
and metal surface played the key role here. To reinforce, Novotny
and co-workers showed previously that for molecule–gold distances
shorter than 5 nm, the molecular fluorescence was quenched.18 Also, there are several reports which show that
monolayers of molecules on gold and silver surfaces showed surface-enhanced
Raman scattering with complete quenching of fluorescence.33−36 It is already mentioned that core–shell structures are common
and preferred to acquire a better MEF effect. Certainly, the thickness
(distance) between the metal and the fluorophore determines whether
a strategy will be a successful one or not. In this study, the thickness
for the bilayer of the niosomes was found to be around ∼20
nm, as can be understood from Figures 1d and S10. Consequently, the optimum distance was <10
nm between the metal and the fluorophore, as can be postulated from Scheme 1. The repeated reproducible
observations (Figure S3) confirmed the
fact that this distance turned out to be optimum for MEF for this
above-mentioned system. Hence, the observed findings are legitimate,
as if the fluorophore complex inside niosome and AuNPs outside mimic
the core–shell strategy, by maintaining an optimum distance
to demonstrate the MEF effect. Another study,37 under aqueous conditions from our group, demonstrated a similar
2- to 3-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity for the negatively
charged carbon dots, when coupled with ∼40 nm positively charged
AuNPs with a silica coating of ∼8 nm thickness. As expected,
the free PPQ molecule (without complexation with Zn2+)
did not show any fluorescence enhancement (Figure S1) in the presence of the same set of AuNPs. This indicated
that the distance was possibly large between them for any substantial
MEF to take place, as PPQ stayed in the core region of the hydrophobic
bilayer (Scheme 1).
Also, in the absence of AuNPs, the PZP complex did not show any fluorescent
enhancement (Figure S2). At the same time,
we also failed to get any fluorescence enhancement after repeating
the same experiment by replacing the niosome solution with neutral
tween micellar solution (Figure S4). This
was probably expected, as the size of the micelles was much smaller
(less than 10 nm) to replicate the same structural requirement to
induce the MEF effect for this system. Moreover, as mentioned earlier,
the exact same study performed with 18 and 160 nm AuNPs did not show
any enhancement, highlighting the significant effect of the size for
the scatterers in MEF. It is important to note that the MEF studies
were repeated several times, and the statistical information about
the reproducibility of the MEF studies is shown in Figure S3.

2.4 Mechanism of MEF
At present, MEF
is thought to be consisting of two mechanisms: (1) local electric
field effect and (2) intrinsic radiative decay rate effect.4 However, the local field of the nanostructure
also may or may not increase the radiative decay rate (kr) of the fluorophore. In the first mechanism, the metal
surface or particles produce an LSPR effect which can strengthen the
local electric field. It is noteworthy that the local electric field
effect alone does not alter the lifetime and quantum yield (QY) of
fluorophores. The other mechanism is that the nanoparticles can strengthen
the intrinsic radiative decay rate of the fluorophore. Unlike the
local electric field effect, when fluorescence intensity is enhanced
by the intrinsic radiative decay rate effect, the QY increases, but
the lifetime decreases. To better understand this mechanism, one can
point out the differences in the Jablonski diagram (Figure 5). Hence, fluorescence lifetime
is considered as an important characterization method, where a substantial
decrease in lifetime with associated enhancement will confirm the
MEF mechanism. Therefore, it turns out that in the absence of metals, Q0 = (Γ/Γ + knr + kq) and τ0 = (Γ + knr + kq) –1, where kq is the rate constant of the quenching process, if any, whereas
in the presence of metals, Qm = (Γ
+ Γm/Γ + Γm + knr + kq) and τm = (Γ + Γm + knr + kq)−1.

excitation in the presence of metal, Γ: radiative decay, knr: nonradiative decay, Γm:

Subsequently, as can be seen in Figure 6 and Table 1, we noticed a decrease in the faster component of
the lifetime of the fluorophore PZP from 0.1 to 0.06 ns followed by
the addition of 33 nm AuNPs. However, the average lifetimes were found
to be similar with no significant change, whereas the QY increased
from 2.1 × 10–3 to only 6.7 × 10–3. The average lifetime of the fluorophores was calculated using the
following equation:  where τi is the lifetime of the
particular component, αi is the
contribution of that particular component,
and τf is the average lifetime. The findings definitely
indicated that the possible mechanism to be predominantly derived
from the enhancement of the intrinsic radiative decay rate rather
than the local electric field effect in our study, as suggested by
the decrease in the fluorophore lifetime and increase in the QY. To
substantiate our claim, we have also performed both steady-state and
lifetime titration experiments for the PZP molecule with an increasing
amount of 33 nm AuNPs (Figure S11). We
observed that the faster component was shortened with an increasing
amount of particles, while steady-state fluorescence intensity increased
continuously. The average lifetime, however, remained indifferent
with the addition of the particles. This observation indeed suggested
about the radiation enhancement mechanism for 33 nm AuNPs. When the
same titration studies were performed with the addition of 18 nm AuNPs,
we noticed an opposite trend (Figure S12). With the increasing amount of particles, both the faster component
and the average lifetime were lengthened to some extent, while steady-state
fluorescence intensity decreased continuously. This observation ruled
out the possibility that the decrease in fluorescence intensity was
due to a nonchalant attachment of smaller 18 nm particles in more
number on the niosome surface, in which case, the lifetime would have
decreased as well.

2.5 Analysis on the Basis of RP Model
To understand the
role of a particular metallic nanoparticle in the
observed MEF, we used the RP model introduced by Lakowicz, in 2005.38 According to RP model, the emission from the
excited fluorophore couples with the surface plasmon of the metal,
and as a result, surface plasmon-coupled emission is observed with
higher intensity, at the same wavelength as the free fluorophore.
Very importantly, for AuNPs, it was proposed that the induced plasmons
will radiate whenever the scattering cross section of the nanoparticle
would be dominant compared to the absorption cross section of the
colloid. Hence, the size of the metallic nanoparticles is very important
for the observed MEF, as scattering efficiencies are directly proportional
to the diameter of the particle. We have calculated (Figure 7) the extinction, absorption,
and scattering spectra of the AuNPs, using MiePlot4613 software.39 We observed that the fluorescence spectrum of
PZP has moderate overlapping with the scattering bands of all the
three AuNPs (Figure 7d). However, it is known38 and can also
be seen in Figure 7a that the absorption component is very high for AuNPs around or
less than 20 nm, whereas the scattering component is very less. Possibly
because of high absorption coefficient, we have observed in fact a
quenching effect instead of MEF, for 18 nm AuNPs (Figures 4 and S13). To our delight,
we observed the desired MEF, only with 33 nm, which has higher scattering
cross section and lower absorption factor (Figure 7b). As we further increase the size of the
AuNPs, we expect that the scattering component should increase with
low absorption component, increasing the probability of successful
MEF as explained in the RP model. However, the result is counterintuitive
as observed with 160 nm AuNPs, showing absolutely no evidence of MEF
(Figure 4). At this
point, we should also keep this in mind that the line width of the
extinction band is directly related to their ability to concentrate
and enhance the incident electromagnetic field.40 Therefore, if a line width for a plasmonic band is found
very broad, it becomes difficult for that particular nanoparticle
to enhance the fluorescence, although theoretically scattering efficiencies
are still high. This is probably the reason that we do not see any
change in the fluorescence outcome with 160 nm AuNPs, as the plasmonic
band is very broad (Figures 3 and 7c), as well as the extinction
coefficient is also less, compared to 18 and 33 nm AuNPs.

18, 33, and 160 nm AuNPs. (d) Overlap of scattering spectra of 18,

3 Conclusions
To the
best of our knowledge, first-time bilayer vesicle platforms
have been used to study MEF under aqueous conditions. With the addition
of suitable AuNPs, the fluorescence intensity of the reporter fluorophore
molecule PZP was found to be increased ∼3-fold. The observations
were independent of the excitation wavelength and the composition
of the vesicle. The optimum distance between the metal and the fluorophore
was postulated to be <10 nm, associated with the enhancement. The
possible mechanism for the MEF phenomena was ascribed mainly because
of the enhancement of intrinsic radiative decay rate, as suggested
by the decrease in the fluorophore lifetime along with the increase
in the QY. Among different AuNPs, MEF was achieved only with an average
diameter of 33 nm, whereas 18 and 160 nm particles did not show any
enhancement. These observations followed by theoretical calculation
of the scattering cross sections of the nanoparticles substantiated
the role of the size of the AuNPs in MEF. In addition, the obtained
results also indicated the importance of the sharper line widths and
higher scattering cross sections of the AuNPs in MEF. Further works
are underway using different systems for a possible increase in the
degree of enhancement.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Span 80, cholesterol, HAuCl4,
and trisodium citrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
and used without further purification.

4.2 AuNPs
Preparation
The AuNP synthesis
comprised reduction of gold solution with trisodium citrate (Turkevich
method). This method was chosen for the following two reasons: first,
Turkevich method is known to produce spherical AuNPs. Second, the
surface of the AuNPs will be stabilized by citrate and thereby rendering
it negatively charged. In this reduction process, first 20 mL of 0.25
mM HAuCl4 solution was heated to boiling and then a requisite
amount of aqueous solution of 1% trisodium citrate was added to a
beaker containing HAuCl4 solution, under vigorous stirring.
The boiling was continued till the solution changes its color. To
produce larger particles, less trisodium citrate was added as shown
in Table 2 because
reducing the amount of trisodium citrate reduced the amount of the
citrate ions available for stabilizing the nanoparticles, causing
the small particles to aggregate into bigger ones.

4.3 Niosome Preparation
Niosomes were
prepared using a standard method, known as a thin layer evaporation
method.41,42 Nonionic surfactant Span 80 and cholesterol
were taken in the molar ratio (mM) of 1:1. Later, these were dissolved
in a 2:1 ratio of chloroform/methanol mixture. The solvents were evaporated
in a rotary evaporator under a vacuum of 20 Hg at 30 °C and 100
rpm until a thin film is formed in the round-bottom flask, which was
then hydrated with Millipore water.43 The
suspension was vortexed for 5 min and then sonicated for 30 min to
obtain the final niosomal suspension.

4.4 DLS Technique
The particle size and
zeta potential of the samples were analyzed by the DLS technique using
a Malvern particle size analyzer (zetasizer nano-ZS).

4.5 SEM Studies
SEM images were collected
using a JEOL JSM-7600F field emission scanning electron microscope.
Before imaging, the solution was drop-cast on a silicon wafer and
kept it for a long time in the presence of vacuum to make sure that
it was completely dried. All the images were taken in the secondary
electron imaging mode.

4.6 Sample Preparations for
MEF Studies
While adding PPQ into niosome solution, first
a small aliquot of
0.1 mL from a stock solution containing 10–2 mol
of PPQ in DMF was added to 9.9 mL of aqueous niosome solution and
mixed well by vortexing for 2 min. The resultant PPQ concentration
was 10–4 M in all cases and the DMF content
was always low (∼1% v/v). Afterward, 500 μl of 10–3 M Zn2+ solution was added to form the
complex PZP. Nanoparticle suspension (500 μl) was added for
each of the MEF experiments in 2.5 mL of PZP–niosome solution.

4.7 Absorption and Fluorescence Studies
Steady-state
fluorescence measurements of samples containing PZP
in niosome, with and without the nanoparticles, were performed with
a Hitachi spectrofluorometer (F7000) using a 1 cm path length quartz
cuvette. For all of the fluorescence data presented in this manuscript,
all sample preparations and experiments were performed at 25 °C.
Fluorescence lifetimes were measured from time-resolved intensity
decay rate by the method of time-correlated single-photon counting
using a Horiba Deltaflex Modular fluorescence lifetime system with
the following instrumental settings: 340 nm NanoLED excitation, peak
preset 10 000 counts, and emission wavelength was set at 450
nm. Quartz cuvettes were used for the measurements. For collecting
the extinction spectra of the nanoparticle samples, we have used a
Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus UV–visible spectrophotometer.

4.8 ET(30) Studies
of the Fluorophores
ET(30) studies
were performed to determine the location of PPQ and PZP in a niosome
environment. The study was carried out by measuring the fluorescence
maxima of the fluorophores by changing the solvent polarity, as fluorescence
maxima of the molecules heavily depend on the micropolarity of the
surroundings. First, solutions of different percentages of dioxane–water
mixture were prepared, and then the same amount of PPQ and PZP in
each of the solution was dissolved. The standard ET30 parameters are known from the literature for each
of the dioxane–water mixture with varying percentages (see Table S2). Next, emission spectra of each of
the mixture containing the fluorophores was recorded, and a correlation
plot was obtained from the emission maxima of both PPQ and PZP in
different compositions of dioxane–water mixture against the
solvent polarity parameter (ET30). Then,
the samples (PPQ and PZP) were entrapped in Span niosomes and their
fluorescence maxima were recorded and compared with the calibration
curve values obtained already. Accordingly, the location of the fluorophores
PPQ and PZP in the niosome environment was confirmed. The ET30 values of PPQ and PZP can be found in Table S1.
