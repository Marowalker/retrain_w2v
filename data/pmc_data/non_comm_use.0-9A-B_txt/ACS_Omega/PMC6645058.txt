Si nanowires
(SiNWs) produced by metal-assisted chemical etching on n-type Si were investigated for
their use as a light-trapping material in c-Si solar cells. The nanowires
were fabricated before junction formation (on a lightly doped Si substrate)
so that their core was bulk and nonporous. The above fabrication process
was implemented in solar cell fabrication. The SiNW reflectivity was
tested at different steps of solar cell processing and found to be
lower than that of conventional random pyramids used in c-Si solar
cells. Contact formation on the front side of the cell was investigated
by considering metal deposition either directly on the nanowires or
on bulk areas in between the nanowire areas. The superiority of this
second case was demonstrated. Three different Si nanowire lengths
were investigated, namely, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm, the case of 1
μm giving better results in terms of solar cell characteristics
and external quantum efficiency. The electronic quality of the Si
nanowire surface was investigated using the corresponding metal-oxide-semiconductor
capacitors with atomic-layer-deposited alumina dielectric. Successful
reduction of surface recombination centers at the large Si nanowire
surface was achieved by reducing structural defects at their surface
through a specific chemical treatment. Finally, using the determined
optimized conditions for Si nanowire formation, chemical cleaning,
and process implementation in solar cell fabrication, we demonstrated
∼45% increase in solar cell efficiency with 1 μm SiNWs
compared to that from a flat reference cell processed under similar
conditions. The above study was made on test solar cells without surface
passivation.

I Introduction
High-performance c-Si
solar cells require efficient light absorption within the absorber and
efficient carrier collection of photoexcited carriers. Vertical silicon
nanowires (SiNWs) on the Si surface can play a significant role in
enhancing light trapping due to their strong broadband optical absorbance
and antireflective properties in a broad range of incident angles.1−3 There are different techniques to produce SiNW arrays on the Si
surface, including lithography and etching,4−8 vapor–liquid–solid growth,9,10 and metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE).11−17 MACE is a low-cost, fast, and easy method to produce Si nanowires
on the c-Si surface with diameter in the 30–100 nm range. Their
length, morphology, and structure depend on the etching time, the
resistivity of the Si wafer, and the catalytic metal used in MACE.18 On wafers with moderate resistivity (1–10
Ω cm), the nanowires are bulk, whereas on highly doped n- or
p-type wafers, the resulting nanowires are porous.

The use of
SiNWs by MACE in c-Si solar cells on p-type substrates
has been studied by several groups,19−24 including industrially processed solar cells with a cell size of
156 mm × 156 mm.25 However, less work
was devoted to SiNWs in c-Si solar cells on n-type substrates,24 which gain increasing interest due to their
demonstrated relative tolerance to common impurities like iron and
oxygen and their immunity to boron–oxygen light-induced degradation
reported in p-type crystalline Si solar cells.26,27

The low-reflectivity advantage of SiNWs by MACE as a light-trapping
material in c-Si solar cells is counterbalanced by the increased surface
recombination at the large Si nanowire surface.1−3 The best method
proposed so far to passivate the SiNW surface is by conformal atomic
layer deposition (ALD) of alumina deposition.3 However, further studies are needed to optimize the above passivation
scheme.

In this work, we investigated the use of bulk Si nanowires
by MACE
as a light-trapping material on the front side of an n-type c-Si solar
cell. SiNWs by MACE are bulk (nonporous) when they are formed on lightly
doped Si. The same MACE process applied on highly doped Si results
in porous Si nanowires. Consequently, for bulk SiNWs on the front
side of c-Si solar cells, SiNW formation has to precede junction formation.
This process sequence results in an emitter composed of the doped
SiNWs and a doped continuous layer in bulk Si underneath the SiNWs.
We studied the effect of SiNW length on solar cell characteristics
by investigating three different lengths: 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm.
Reflectance spectra were recorded at different process steps of solar
cell formation, and corresponding results will be discussed. Another
challenge toward optimized solar cells with SiNWs at the front solar
cell surface is the front metal contact. We investigated the use of
an Al grid either deposited directly on the SiNWs or on bulk areas
in between the SiNW areas. Finally, toward optimizing ALD alumina
passivation of SiNWs, we investigated the use of a chemical treatment
applied on the as-formed nanowires to remove structural defects from
their surface and thus minimize interface states at the SiNW/ALD alumina
interface. The electronic quality of the SiNW surface was tested by
fabricating corresponding metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test capacitors
with ALD alumina dielectric and studying their electrical characteristics,
from which the density of electronic states at the dielectric/SiNW
surface was deduced.

II Experimental Results
The Si wafers used in this work were n-type single-face-polished,
(100)-oriented Czochralski crystalline Si wafers with resistivity
in the range of 1–2 Ω cm and thickness ∼400 μm.

II.I SiNW Formation
SiNWs were fabricated
using a single-step MACE process. Details on the process used are
given in the experimental procedures, materials, and methods section.
A two-step chemical cleaning was applied to remove structural defects
from the SiNW surface, consisting of a sequence of piranha cleaning,
followed by a dip in 2% per volume aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF)
solution at room temperature. Piranha cleaning is an oxidizing chemical
process for Si, whereas the HF dip removes the formed oxide. By the
subsequent use of the above, tiny structural defects at the SiNW surface
are first surrounded by a silicon oxide during the piranha cleaning,
whereas in the second step, these tiny defects are removed by liftoff,
together with any other residues at the SiNW surface.

SiNWs
with three different lengths, namely, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm, were
fabricated and subjected to the above cleaning process. Corresponding
solar cells were fabricated under the same experimental conditions.

II.II Solar Cell Fabrication
Solar cells
of a surface area of 1 cm2 were fabricated on n-type Si
wafers. Details of the process and materials used are given in the
experimental procedures, materials, and methods section. Three different
solar cell architectures were fabricated:(a) Solar cell 1: reference cell without
SiNWs.

(b) Solar cell 2:
grid on SiNWs. In this
cell, SiNWs were formed everywhere on the front solar cell surface
area and the Al metal grid was in direct contact with the nanowires.

(c) Solar cell 3: grid on
bulk Si. In
this cell, SiNWs were formed on confined areas of 200 μm ×
200 μm separated by a tetragonal mesh of bulk Si areas covered
with the Al metal mesh of the gate.



The
p+ emitter was formed using spin-on doping
(SOD), providing boron dopants. In the case of the SiNW solar cells
2 and 3, the p+ emitter was formed after SiNW formation.
The Al metal grid in all cases was covering a gate surface area of
∼15% of the total (same in all cells). In solar cell 3, the
metal gate was aligned on the bulk Si areas and partly on SiNWs around
the bulk, whereas in solar cell 2, the Al grid was in direct contact
with the SiNWs. A back ohmic contact was formed on the backside of
the wafer, its formation being implemented in the process flow in
the corresponding order. A patterned SiO2 layer was used
as a passivation/reflector layer. Figure 1a,b shows a cross-sectional view in two-dimensional
(2D) (a) and three-dimensional (3D) (b) representations of solar cell
3, whereas (c) and (d) show a 2D representation of solar cells 2 and
1, respectively. In all cases, the back ohmic contact was composed
of Al on highly doped n+ areas within SiO2 windows,
as depicted in Figure 1.

cell 3 described in the text in 2D (a) and 3D (b) representations.
The schematics in (c) and (d) depict respectively the 2D representation
of solar cell 2 and solar cell 1. In (c), the metal grid is directly
on the SiNWs, whereas in (a), (b), and (d), the Al grid lies on bulk
Si.

II.III SiNW
Structural and Morphological Characteristics
SiNWs by MACE
fabricated under the conditions described above had
a diameter in the range of 50–70 nm and interdistance in the
range of 50–100 nm and were vertical to the Si surface. Corresponding
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are depicted in Figure 2. In confined areas
(solar cell 3), the SiNW length was slightly higher than that on large
surface areas (solar cell 2). This effect (etch rate higher in confined
areas) was studied in detail in ref (14). Figure 2a shows an example of the cross-sectional SEM image of as-formed
SiNWs by MACE, whereas Figure 2b,c depicts SiNWs imaged after the SOD process and showing
some damage by this process, attributed to stress effects during the
thermal cycle. Figure 2d shows the SiNWs in (b) after Al deposition. Conformal coverage
of the SiNW surface is clearly seen, with Al crystals growing on the
top of SiNWs after their full coverage, forming Al nanowires of increasing
diameter and length with increasing deposition time. As mentioned
above and illustrated in Figure 1, in solar cell 3, the Al grid was in direct contact
with the patterned bulk crystalline Si areas, slightly exceeding those
surface areas so as to partially cover SiNWs. In solar cell 2, the
Al grid was directly deposited on the SiNW surface and had the same
surface area as in solar cells 1 and 3. SOD was deposited after SiNW
formation; however, after annealing, a p–n junction was formed
underneath the SiNWs. Both the SiNWs and a c-Si layer underneath them
were doped with boron. The presence of SiNWs during SOD resulted in a slightly
shallower junction depth than in the reference solar cell without
SiNWs. In the case of solar cell 3, bulk areas underneath the Al grid
were also doped by SOD.

areas after the SOD process (b, c), and after Al deposition on SOD-processed
nanowires (d).

II.IV Reflectivity
Measurements
Reflectivity
measurements were performed on samples with SiNWs at different stages
of processing. The corresponding reflectance spectra are depicted
in Figure 3 (spectra
(1)–(8)) as follows: (1) n-type bulk crystalline Si (no SiNWs),
(2) as-formed SiNWs on a planar Si surface area, ((3)–(5))
SiNWs of lengths 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm, respectively, on a planar
Si surface area after SOD processing, ((6) and (7)) similar reflectance
spectra as in (4) and (5) but for SiNWs formed on confined areas.
For comparison, spectrum (8) is the reflectance spectrum, from the
literature,28 of a Si surface with
random pyramids used as an antireflective material in conventional
c-Si solar cells. From Figure 3, we deduce that the reflectivity of our SiNWs is significantly
lower than that of bulk crystalline Si and it decreases with the increasing
SiNW length from 0.5 to 1.5 μm (see spectra (3)–(5)).
If we now compare sample (3) with (6) and (4) with (7) with the only
difference that in (3) and (4) the SiNWs were everywhere on the surface,
whereas in (6) and (7), they were only in confined areas, we see that
the reflectance spectra are significantly lower in the case of SiNWs
in confined areas compared to those in the case of SiNWs on large
Si areas, despite the fact that in the case of confined areas 15%
of surface coverage is bulk Si. This is attributed to two different
effects: (a) As stated above, we have observed that under the same
experimental conditions SiNWs in confined areas are less damaged by
the SOD process compared with SiNWs on a large Si area and (b) SiNWs
in confined areas are slightly longer compared with SiNWs in nonconfined
areas.14 These two effects are at the origin
of the observed differences in reflectivity. If we now compare the
reflectance spectra of SiNWs with the spectrum of a nanostructured
surface with random inverted pyramids used in conventional c-Si solar
cells (green dotted line 9),28 we see that
the reflectance spectrum of SiNWs before SOD (spectrum (2)) and also
the reflectance spectra of 1 and 1.5 μm SiNWs in confined areas
even after SOD ((6) and (7)) are all below the reflectance spectrum
of inverted pyramids. This is an interesting result toward improving
Si solar cells by replacing the inverted pyramids with SiNWs. We have
chosen the reflectance spectrum of ref (28) because this spectrum is directly comparable
with the corresponding reflectance spectra of this work since there
is no additional passivation/antireflection coating on the inverted
pyramids, as is the case in most of the related papers in the literature.
In optimized c-Si solar cells, the random pyramids are coated with
a double-29 or multilayer dielectric stack30 with both passivation and antireflection properties,
exhibiting reflectivity below 5% in the whole optical spectrum. It
is thus important to note that a similar result is achieved using
SiNWs without any antireflective coating on them. Furthermore, our
reflectance spectrum of 1 μm SiNWs on a planar surface (curve
(2) of Figure 3) is
comparable with that of inverted pyramids obtained by MACE in ref (31) (reflectance also below
5%). However, in that second case, the shown SEM images depicted an
additional rough porous Si layer on the surface of the inverted pyramids,
which is expected to be fully detrimental for the solar cell efficiency,
introducing important surface recombination due to an increased number
of surface states. No results on fabricated solar cells were presented
in that ref (31) to
verify the above statement.

Figure 3 Reflectance spectra from five different samples
as follows: (1)
flat reference Si surface, (2) Si surface with as-grown 1 μm
SiNWs everywhere, (3)–(5) as-grown SiNWs of lengths 0.5, 1,
and 1.5 μm on a planar surface after the SOD process, and (6)
and (7) 1 and 1.5 μm SiNWs on confined areas after SOD. For
comparison, we show in (8) the reflectance spectrum from the literature
(ref (29)) for a Si
surface with random pyramids without surface passivation, used in
conventional c-Si solar cells. (9) Spectrum from inverted pyramids

II.V Electrical and Photoelectric Measurements
of Solar Cells
The electrical and photoelectric characteristics
of the three different devices studied in this work (solar cell 1
(reference), solar cell 2 (1 μm SiNWs, grid on SiNWs), and solar
cell 3 (1 μm SiNWs, grid on bulk)) are depicted in Figure 4a–d. Figure 4a depicts the dark
current density versus voltage curve for the above three cases, whereas
(b) shows the photocurrent density versus voltage curve. The external
and internal quantum efficiencies (EQE and IQE, respectively) versus
wavelength are depicted in (c) and (d), respectively, for all three
devices. IQE was calculated from EQE by taking into account the reflectance
spectra of Figure 4; thus, their differences reflect the antireflective properties of
the SiNWs. Short circuit current (Jsc)
and open circuit voltage (Voc) were determined
from Figure 4b.

Figure 4 (a) Dark current

three different devices studied in this work (black curves: solar
cell 1, reference cell; red curves: solar cell 2 with grid on SiNWs;

characteristics (current density–voltage) of the above three
devices, (c, d) external (EQE) and internal (IQE) quantum efficiencies
versus wavelength of the three different devices studied in this work.

The electrical parameters of the
solar cells in the dark (saturation
current Is, series resistance Rs, and ideality factor n of
the diode) were calculated using the single-diode model, with the
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics described by  where Is is the
saturation current, Rs is the series resistance, n is the ideality factor of the diode, K is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. Rs was calculated from  The saturation current, Is, was calculated by fitting the I–V characteristics using the equation of
the diode corrected
to the series resistance.

Table 1 summarizes
the electrical and photoelectric parameters of the three different
solar cells studied in this work, including the saturation current
density (Js; Is normalized to the solar cell surface area), the series resistance
(Rs), the diode ideality factor (n), the short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photovoltaic efficiency (PVE). Table 2 shows a comparison
of the photoelectric parameters of three SiNW solar cells with grid
on bulk and different SiNW lengths.

In Table 1, it is
seen that the saturation current density, Js, and the ideality factor, n, are quite similar
for all three devices, being slightly lower in the case of the reference
solar cell, as expected. The increased saturation current and thus
the increased ideality factor above 1, which is the value of the ideal
or Shockley diode, are attributed to carrier recombination in the
emitter formed by SOD on the already existing SiNWs. In the case of
the SiNW cells, the emitter is extended both in the core of the SiNWs
and in a layer underneath them. It is thus expected that the roughness
and structural defects at the SiNW surface affect the above carrier
recombination. The fact that the obtained values for the SiNW cells
and the reference cell are quite similar suggests that defects at
the SiNW surface are minimized by the process used for their smoothing.
The increased ideality factor reduces the fill factor, FF, of the
cells; it could thus partly explain the better FF in the case of the
reference cell.

The short circuit current (Jsc; see Figure 4b and Table 1) is much higher in the SiNW
solar cells compared to that in the reference cell, the best case
being that of the SiNWs in confined areas and grid on bulk. The factors
that are expected to influence Jsc are
the efficiency of light absorption in the cell, the defect-driven
space charge recombination in the emitter as discussed above, and
the existence of a high series resistance. Concerning the series resistance,
the general comment in our study is that in all cases of our devices
(see Table 1) Rs was relatively small; thus, it is not expected
to seriously affect Jsc. The smallest Rs was obtained in the case of the reference
cell, as expected. SiNWs introduce higher series resistance mainly
resulting from their rough surface. It is thus understood why this
is the highest in the case of SiNWs with the grid directly on the
nanowires, partly explaining the smaller Jsc compared to that of the cell with SiNWs with grid on bulk. The main
factor influencing the observed differences in Jsc is the antireflection properties of the SiNW solar cells.
From Figure 3, we deduce
that surface reflectivity on confined areas with the grid on bulk
(spectrum 6) is lower than that of SiNWs everywhere on the Si surface
and Al grid directly on the nanowires (spectrum 4). This may be attributed
to differences in the damage produced by the SOD process (including an annealing
step) when the SiNWs were everywhere on the Si surface area compared
to the case of SiNWs in confined areas. This was confirmed by corresponding
SEM images (not shown here).

Concerning the shunt resistance
of our solar cells, the measured
values were in the MΩ cm2 range, being quite similar
in all cases of the measured devices. Its effect on the open circuit
voltage is thus expected to be negligible.

The external quantum
efficiency, EQE, is much better in SiNW cells
2 and 3 compared to that in the reference cell in the optical region
of the spectrum, attributed to the better antireflective properties
of the SiNWs in the above cells. Furthermore, solar cell 3 shows better
EQE and IQE than the other two solar cells in the red and IR regions
of the spectrum. This could result from reduced recombination in the
Si bulk in this specific cell; however, this cannot be the case since
the substrate is the same for all studied devices. We could thus suggest
that this is an effect of this specific cell architecture and its
back contact, resulting in better light trapping of the red and IR
light in the cell.

If we compare the open circuit voltage, Voc, of the different cells of Tables 1 and 2, we see that
the reference cell and the 0.5 μm SiNW cell have roughly similar Voc. Between 0.5 and 1.5 μm SiNWs, Voc is worse in the second case. The case of
SiNWs everywhere on the solar cell surface and grid on them is slightly
worse than the reference cell. The above differences could be attributed
to increased surface recombination in the presence of SiNWs, increasing
with the increase of the SiNW length; however, this is consistent
only with the observed behavior of the 0.5 and 1.5 μm SiNW solar
cells but not for the 1 μm SiNW solar cell with grid on bulk.
The Voc in this case is the highest compared
with all other cases; however, the high Voc is not consistent with an expected decreased saturation current
and ideality factor of the diode (see Table 1). This point needs to be further elucidated.

Concerning the fill factor, FF, the best case was that of the reference
cell compared to the other two cases. This is attributed partly to
differences in the series resistance, which was lower in the case
of the reference cell compared to that in the other two cases and
lower in solar cell 3 compared to that in solar cell 2. When Rs decreases, FF increases. However, the most
important parameter influencing the fill factor of our solar cells
is the ideality factor, n, of the cell. When the
ideality factor increases, FF decreases. In Table 1, it is clearly seen that changes in n are
accordingly reflected to FF. Differences in the ideality factor may
result from differences in the doping concentration of the emitter.
In our SiNW solar cells, it is expected that the junction is mainly
formed underneath the SiNWs, forming a continuous doped layer. The
SiNWs themselves are also expected to be doped since their diameter
is quite large, approximately 70 nm, and confinement effects making
doping difficult are not expected to be present. Differences in the
doping concentration of the emitter lead to differences in the width
of the space charge region falling in the emitter. An increase in
the doping concentration of the emitter can thus reduce space charge
recombination and consequently the ideality factor, this being reflected
to the fill factor.

A comparison was also made between solar
cells with SiNWs of three
different lengths, namely 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm, and grid on bulk.
The results are summarized in Table 2. The best performance was achieved with the 1 μm
SiNWs. Compared to that in the case of the 0.5 μm SiNWs, the
better performance of the 1 μm SiNW solar cell is mainly attributed
to the higher reflectance of the 1 μm SiNWs compared to that
of the 0.5 μm ones. The worse performance was achieved with
the 1.5 μm SiNWs, in spite of the fact that these finally showed lower reflectance
than that from the 1 μm SiNWs. This is attributed to an increased
density of surface states in SiNWs fabricated by MACE when their length
exceeds 1 μm.32 Indeed, in this last
case, the top part of the length of the SiNWs becomes porous, as demonstrated
in ref (32). Thus,
surface roughness and structural defects are introduced, which result
in not only better light absorption (thus lower reflectivity) but
also an increase of carrier recombination at the SiNW surface. The
presence of these defects affects all three parameters of the cell,
as explained above.

Overall, a 13.4% efficiency was obtained
with our solar cell 3
without using any passivation layer on the solar cell surface. The
above result was not optimized since the aim of this study was not
solar cell optimization but the understanding of the effect on the
different solar cell parameters of the use of SiNWs as antireflective
material on the front solar cell surface.

II.VI ALD
Alumina/SiNW Interface Characterization
by C–V Measurements on Test
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) Capacitors
Structural defects
at the SiNW surface induce surface states, which are a significant
source of surface recombination of the solar cell. To test the effectiveness
of the applied chemical treatment to reduce structural defects, we
fabricated test capacitors and use them as test devices for the characterization
of the electronic quality of the SiNW surface. The capacitors were
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices including the SiNWs on the
gate, whereas atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) was used as the capacitor dielectric.32 A schematic representation of a cross-sectional
view of the test capacitor is depicted in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic representation of a SiNW test
capacitor on n-type
Si with ALD alumina dielectric. (b) C–V and G/ω vs voltage characteristics
(blue line, 1 MHz; red line, 1 kHz) of the SiNW capacitor on n-type
Si. SiNWs were subjected to two cycles of piranha/HF chemical cleaning.
There is almost no frequency dispersion at accumulation, indicative
of the reduced series resistance. From the G/ω
peak at depletion, the density of interface states can be calculated.
The peak at 1 MHz (blue line) is higher than that at 1 kHz (red line),
suggesting that fast responding traps are predominant.

To reduce structural defects or the presence of
contaminants on
the Si nanowire surface, we used a chemical treatment with a first
step of piranha (mixture of H2SO4 and H2O2) cleaning, followed by an HF dip. This process
was found to significantly reduce structural defects at the SiNW surface,
thus reducing both the series resistance and the density of interface
states at the Al2O3/SiNW interface.32 Indeed, piranha cleaning oxidizes the SiNW surface,
whereas the HF dip removes the formed silicon oxide. At the same time,
surface structural defects are partially removed, thus smoothing the
SiNW surface. We investigated the electronic quality of the Si nanowire
surface on n-type Si by characterizing the MIS capacitor of Figure 5a using capacitance–voltage
(C–V) and conductance–voltage
(G/ω–V, where ω
is the circular frequency) measurements in the frequency range 1 kHz
to 1 MHz. Typical results are shown in Figure 5b, depicting C–V characteristics on the left axis and the corresponding G/ω–V characteristics on the right axis (blue
line, 1 MHz; red line, 1 kHz). Detailed results are given in ref (32). From the curves of Figure 5, one can deduce
that after the chemical treatment a high-quality alumina/SiNW interface
is achieved. There is very limited frequency dispersion at accumulation
in the studied frequency range, and only a small frequency dispersion
is observed at depletion, attributed to charging of the structure
after the first voltage sweep. The G/ω versus
voltage curve (see the right axis of Figure 5b) shows a peak at depletion, attributed
to interface states at the alumina/SiNW interface. The intensity of
the peak at depletion is higher at 1 MHz than at 1 kHz, which implies
that the corresponding interface states are fast. The density of interface
states Dit was determined using the conductance
method and was found to be 1.05 × 1013 cm–2 eV–2 for the capacitor with the as-grown SiNWs
and 7 × 1011 cm–2 eV–2 in the case of the MOS capacitor with SiNWs after the applied chemical
cleaning. This second value of Dit is
quite low for the alumina dielectric, indicative of a good electronic
quality of the SiNW surface after the applied chemical cleaning. This
is attributed to the corresponding smoothing of the SiNW surface and
removal of the tiny structural defects from their surface.33

III Discussion
We
demonstrated that the use of SiNWs by MACE on the front Si surface
of a c-Si solar cell on n-type Si can substantially improve the solar
cell efficiency compared to that of a cell without nanowires. One
restriction is that the SiNWs by MACE should be formed before junction
formation (on moderately doped areas) to have bulk crystalline and
not porous structure. This is because it is well known that SiNWs
by MACE formed on highly doped areas (in this case, the solar cell
emitter) are porous.16 Furthermore, we
have demonstrated (results to be published elsewhere) that junction
formation by SOD applied after SiNW formation results in an almost
planar junction on c-Si underneath the SiNWs. In this specific case,
the main function of
SiNWs is to act as an antireflective material to improve light absorption
by the solar cell. The reflectance spectrum of as-formed SiNWs with
length above 1 μm is far below that of the conventionally nanostructured
surface with inverted pyramids (below 4% in the whole spectrum compared
to above 10% in high wavelengths and above 20% in low wavelengths
in the case of conventional inverted pyramids (see Figure 4)). The 1 μm SiNWs after
the SOD process showed reflectance on the order of 8–12%, always
below that of conventional inverted pyramids without surface passivation.
An improvement of the above is expected if the SOD process is improved
so as to avoid SiNW damage (for example by rapid thermal instead of
furnace annealing).

When comparing the reflectance spectra of
solar cell 2 and solar
cell 3 after the SOD process (see curve 4 compared to curve 6 in Figure 3), we can clearly
see that curve 6 is much below curve 4. This is attributed to the
better mechanical stability of the SiNWs when they are formed in confined
areas between the metal grids compared to that of the SiNWs formed everywhere on the solar cell
surface. SiNWs are less damaged by the annealing process following
SOD when they are confined in smaller areas. The differences in reflectance
spectra are mainly at the origin of the differences in the photocurrent
density and EQE in the above two cases.

Another factor to consider
when comparing the reference cell without
SiNWs with the two SiNW solar cells described above is the junction
depth using SOD. We found that the junction depth was slightly smaller
in the case of the SiNW cells compared to that in the reference cell.
We studied the junction depth by introducing a novel method of junction
cross section imaging based on the different contrast of MACE SiNWs
formed on highly doped areas (porous SiNWs) compared to that of SiNWs
on lightly doped Si (having bulk crystalline structure). This method
is the subject of another paper submitted for publication. The junction
depth of our cells was found to be 1.3 μm in the case of the
planar junction compared to 1.1 μm in the presence of SiNWs
of 1 μm.

The presence of SiNWs on the front solar cell
surface (3D nanostructuring
of the surface) introduces a difficulty in the metallization scheme
to be used. The solution is the solar cell architecture with the grid
on bulk Si and the SiNWs in confined areas within the grid openings,
as the architecture used in solar cell 3.

Finally, using an
n-type c-Si substrate for our solar cells in
combination with SiNWs by MACE, we demonstrated high electronic quality
of the SiNW/ALD alumina interface, better than that of the corresponding
interface in the case of the p-type Si substrate studied in ref (28). The structural defects
on the SiNW surface on n-type Si were more effectively removed by
chemical cleaning than in the case of SiNWs on p-type Si.28 No bulk traps were observed in the case of n-type
Si, as demonstrated in this paper. This result is very promising toward
incorporating ALD alumina as a passivation layer on SiNWs by MACE
in c-Si solar cells on an n-type Si substrate.

IV Conclusions
SiNWs by MACE with bulk structure on n-type Si were investigated
for their use as a light-trapping material in c-Si solar cells. Their
reflectivity at different stages of solar cell processing (e.g., emitter
formation by SOD) was investigated and found to be lower than that
of conventional random pyramids mainly used in c-Si solar cells. Front
contact formation either directly on the SiNWs or on bulk areas in
between SiNW areas was also investigated. We found that the above
second case resulted in better solar cell characteristics of the cell.
Three different SiNW lengths were investigated, namely, 0.5, 1, and
1.5 μm. The case of 1 μm SiNWs gave better results in
terms of solar cell characteristics and external quantum efficiency.
We also showed that the SOD process causes some damage of the SiNWs,
which is reduced by fabricating them in confined areas within a grid
of bulk Si areas. These bulk areas are also used as contact areas
on which the Al grid is deposited. Solar cells with SiNWs of 1 μm
were compared with reference flat area solar cells. A 45% increase
in efficiency was measured with the use of SiNWs. Finally, we applied
a chemical treatment to remove structural defects from the SiNW surface,
which resulted in improving the electronic quality of the ALD alumina/SiNW
interface. In a future work, the obtained results will be used to
fabricate optimized c-Si solar cells on an n-type substrate with ALD-passivated
SiNWs on their front surface.

V Experimental Procedures,
Materials, and Methods
V.I Substrates
In
this work, n-type single-face-polished,
(100)-oriented Czochralski crystalline Si wafers were used with resistivity
in the range of 1–2 Ω cm and thickness ∼400 μm.

V.II Formation of SiNWs by MACE
SiNWs
were fabricated using a single-step MACE process. The etching solution
was composed of 4.8 M HF (50%) and 0.02 M AgNO3, and the
process temperature was 30 °C. After SiNW formation, the Ag dendrites
formed on the SiNW surface, as well as Ag residues within the nanowires,
were removed by dipping the samples in HNO3 (50%) for a
short time. A two-step chemical cleaning was then applied to remove
structural defects from the SiNW surface, consisting of a sequence
of piranha cleaning in 1:1 v/v H2O2/H2SO4 solution for 30 min followed by a dip in 2% per volume
aqueous HF solution at room temperature for 1 min. Piranha cleaning
is an oxidizing chemical process for Si, whereas the HF dip removes
the formed oxide, resulting in liftoff of tiny nanostructures and
other residues from the Si surface. SiNWs with three different lengths,
namely, 0.5, 1, or 1.5 μm, were fabricated.

V.III Metal Deposition on SiNWs
Al deposited
by electron gun evaporation was used as the metallization material.
A Denton e-gun evaporator was used in this respect, and the base pressure
in the system was ∼10–6 Torr. The deposited
equivalent thickness on a flat surface was 300 μm. Confocal
coverage of the SiNW surface was observed, as depicted in Figure 2d. The Al layer was
patterned using optical lithography and chemical etching.

V.IV Solar Cell Fabrication
Solar cells
of a surface area of 1 cm2 were fabricated on n-type Si
wafers. Three different solar cell architectures were used: solar
cell 1 was a reference cell, solar cell 2 was a solar cell with SiNWs
everywhere on the front solar cell surface area and an Al metal grid
in direct contact with the nanowires, and solar cell 3 had SiNWs on
confined areas of 200 μm × 200 μm separated by a
tetragonal bulk Si area covered with the Al metal grid as front electrode
metal. The p+ emitter was formed after SiNW formation by
spin-on doping (SOD). The SOD material used was B154 of Filtronics,
providing boron dopants. Spinning of the SOD material was followed
by high-temperature annealing at 1050 °C for 30 min. The remaining
conductive layer on the Si surface after the above process was chemically
removed by dipping the samples in buffered hydrofluoric acid. The
Al metal grid coverage of the device surface area was ∼15%
of the total in all cases. In solar cell 3, the metal grid was aligned
on the bulk Si areas, fully covering them and partly exceeding on
the SiNW surface area around the bulk. An Al back ohmic contact was
formed on the backside of the wafer at the beginning of the process.
The process flow was carefully designed so as to use compatible process
steps in the correct order. A spin-coated resist subsequently removed
was used when needed to protect the already formed areas.

V.V Test Capacitor Fabrication
MOS capacitors
used as test structures for characterizing the electronic quality
of the ALD alumina/SiNW interface were fabricated with the following
process steps: A 500 nm thick silicon field oxide (thermal SiO2) was formed on the Si wafer and patterned to define the capacitor
area. Si nanowires were formed in the SiO2 windows using
MACE through a resist mask protecting the SiO2. The two-step
chemical cleaning was then applied to the samples, and a 10 nm thick
alumina (Al2O3) layer by ALD was deposited on
top of the SiNWs. The last step was Al gate metal deposition, followed
by patterning using lithography and etching to define the gate area.
An ohmic contact was formed on the backside of the wafer, implemented
in the above process steps. The last step was furnace annealing in
forming gas (mixture of H2/N2), performed at
430 °C for 30 min.
