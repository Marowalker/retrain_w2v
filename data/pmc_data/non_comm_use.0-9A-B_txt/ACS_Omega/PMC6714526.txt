A high-yielding, green, and fast
synthesis of alkyl 2-substituted
{[(alkylsulfanyl)carbonothioyl]amino}acetate-type compounds is described.
The one-pot, three-component condensation of alkyl 2-aminoesters,
carbon disulfide, and electron-deficient olefins was the key reaction
to be developed. The products were obtained easily and efficiently,
with good overall yields after two steps (79–91%), employing
short reaction times, without the use of a catalyst, and ultrasonic
irradiation in water. This procedure was exploited to produce antifungals
against the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Some synthesized compounds exhibited good performance as mycelial
growth inhibitors (IC50 < 80 μM). Structural and
antifungal datasets were integrated to explore the comprehensive three-dimensional
quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) using
comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and explain the observed
activity. This integration resulted in an excellent CoMFA model (r2 = 0.812; q2 =
0.771) after substructure-based alignment. According to this model,
synthesized compounds possessing steric bulky electron-withdrawing
groups in the dithiocarbamate moiety can be considered as promising F. oxysporum inhibitors.

Introduction
Infectious episodes caused by fungal crop
pests are an important,
permanent threat to global food security.1,2 This
threat is on the increase as a result of emerging problems associated
with the increasing world population and global climate change, which
encourage action to ensure that the right balance between high-volume
food crops and excellent quality.3 Thus,
the need to discover compounds with antifungal properties has increased
intensely, but the employment and efficacy of such chemical agents
are usually limited owing to toxicity, undesired side effects, application
drawbacks in the field, pharmacokinetic problems, fungal resistance,
and effectiveness on only one molecular target.4 Consequently, safer, efficient, novel, potent antifungals
against phytopathogens with diverse physicochemical properties, low
toxicity, and fewer side effects to the environment and human health
are still required. The quantitative structure–activity relationship
(QSAR) can exhibit significant performance in supporting the discovery
and design of such chemical agents5 since
it embodies the early steps toward a better interpretation of the
structural requirements for bioactivity, even if the action mechanism
can be unknown.6 Comparative molecular
field analysis (CoMFA), the oldest genuine three-dimensional QSAR
(3D-QSAR) approach, has been extensively applied to integrate molecular
features (steric and electrostatic energies) and bioactivity datasets
through statistical tools (e.g., partial least squares (PLS) regression).7 Thus, the main goals of such an integration are
to assemble cross-validated models to predict structure–activity
observations and understand the essential molecular characteristics
for promising antifungal activity.7 Several
examples of CoMFA models for the discovery/design/development of antifungals
against phytopathogens can be found in available publications with
successful results comprising different scaffolds/moieties.5,6,8−10

N-Alkyl and N,N-dialkyl
dithiocarbamates are part of an interesting group of sulfur
compounds in chemistry. The importance of these compounds has increased
recently due their potential applications related to materials/environmental
science11−16 but also due to the broad band of biological activities of some
metal-dithiocarbamate salts, such as antifungal, antitumoral, anticancer,
and leishmanicidal activities,17−19 with the potential to be used
in human health as well as crop protection. In fact, several examples
of these dithiocarbamates (used as salts to ensure water solubility)
have been marketed for a long time as fungicides, such as maneb, propineb,
zineb, among others.20 The Fungicide Resistance
Action Committee (FRAC) reports these kinds of complexes (FRAC code
M03) with low risk of resistance since they have a multisite antifungal
action.21 However, this action requires
high concentrations of these active principles to be effective in
crop protection, resulting in the main disadvantage owing to the plausible
ecotoxicological hazards related to metal accumulation in soils, food,
and even water.22 Therefore, metal replacement
in dithiocarbamate salts by an organic moiety to produce N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamates has regularly been a
matter of interest. In such a context, this metal substitution was
already explored using natural polyols (e.g., glycerol), secondary
amines, and carbon disulfide, affording moderate to good yields (55–93%),23 taking as base the previously reported one-pot,
Michael-type addition of enones (or substitution of alkyl halides)
to a dithiocarbamate moiety.24,25 Very recently, the
design and antifungal action of a set of dithiocarbamic esters with
an acrylate moiety were also reported, indicating that these compounds
can be promising candidates for fungal control.26 From a green chemistry point of view, this approach has
several economically and environmentally friendly factors to be highly
attractive, such as using raw materials, being a metal-free process,
and having 100% atom efficiency for sulfur and nitrogen.27

Using the above-mentioned approach, we
have previously worked on
dithiocarbamate functionalization as part of our research on organic
synthesis toward novel antifungal agents against Fusarium
oxysporum, a very problematic phytopathogen in several
crops.28 Thus, a one-pot, efficient protocol
for the synthesis of N,S-dialkyl
dithiocarbamates 1 derived from l-tryptophan
and electron-deficient olefins was previously reported under the search
for indole-containing analogs as a strategy to obtain phytoalexin
bioisosteres.29 Such a protocol involved
an alkyl 2-aminoesters (from the respective 2-amino acid and aliphatic
alcohols) instead of primary/secondary amines to add more elements
to the green profile of this kind of N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamate synthesis.27 In
the present study, we expand our search for promising antifungal agents,
performing the derivatization of the conventional 2-amino acids l-alanine 2, l-phenylalanine 3, and l-tyrosine 4 (Figure 1) using a similar strategy to widen the available
chemical space to access optimized antifungal action. Additionally,
as a contribution to the green synthesis of these N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamates, the present protocol
also includes a previously reported ultrasound-assisted approach for
other dithiocarbamate derivatives,24 which
importantly reduces the reaction time. Thus, this procedure can be
considered attractive to synthesize these kinds of antifungal compounds
since it is safer, nontoxic, cheaper, less time-consuming, and environment-
and user-friendly. Thus, the aim of this work comprised the synthesis
of the N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamate-containing
compound series 6 (Figure 1) having varied substitutions to investigate their
antifungal activity against F. oxysporum mycelial growth. Comprehensive 3D-QSAR using CoMFA was also accomplished
to rationalize the structural requirements and further optimize these
kinds of structures as antiphytopathogenic agents.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route started with the conversion
of 2–4 to the respective esters through
a previously reported procedure.30 Thus,
alkyl 2-aminoesters 5a–5l (Scheme 1) were separately
obtained in excellent yields (93–98%) from aliphatic alcohols
(i.e., MeOH, EtOH, 2-PrOH, and n-BuOH). Thus, based
on our background,29 reactions of 5a–5l with carbon disulfide and three
Michael acceptors (i.e., acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, and mesityl
oxide) were carried out at room temperature, employing TEA as a base
and THF as a solvent, during 24 h. Diluted hydrochloric acid was then
added to this reaction mixture to remove TEA, and ethyl acetate was
used for extracting the crude product. The main product was finally
purified by means of conventional column chromatography (CC). 1H-NMR and ESI-MS showed the formation of 2-substituted {[(alkylsulfanyl)carbonothioyl]amino}acetate-type
compounds (6) in low yields (24–36%). An increase
in the number of detectable products was observed when reactions were
carried out at higher temperatures. These results suggested that these
compounds could undergo side reactions under worse conditions such
as reflux and strong acid or basic media. These reactions were explained,
in turn, for l-tryptophan derivatives 1, which
can undergo intramolecular cyclization, formation of N,N-dialkylthiourea as a side product, or C–S
cleavage reactions.29

Figure 1 Chemical structures for
compounds 1–6.

For an efficient methodology for the synthesis of compounds 6, sonochemical reaction principles were employed.31−34 So, all the reactions were carried out under ultrasound irradiation
using TEA as a base and water as a solvent. After 1 h under irradiation
at room temperature, compounds 6.1–6.36 were obtained in higher yields (87–92%) (Scheme 1), which were in accordance
with previously reported results for other dithiocarbamate derivatives
using primary and secondary amines (70–95%).24 However, upon performing reactions during longer times
(>2 h) under ultrasonic irradiation, the number of detectable compounds
increased considerably. This behavior can be understood considering
the collateral effects of ultrasound on organic reactions. Cavitation
phenomena can create and enlarge gaseous and vaporous cavities within
the irradiated liquid medium. These cavities implode, inducing higher
local temperatures and pressures inside the bubbles. This physical
process enhances the molecular diffusion through the creation of a
turbulent flow in the liquid medium.35 Although
some reactions can be accelerated by ultrasonic irradiation, thermal
unstable compounds, such as alkyl dithiocarbamates, can be decomposed
under longer reaction times.36

Antifungal Activity of Synthetic Compounds
It is known
that the dithiocarbamate functional group, in both linear and cyclic
compounds, has important influence on the bioactivity of several agents.37 Specifically, antifungal activity results have
demonstrated a good correlation between the variations on percent
inhibition and the steric–electrostatic properties.26,38 To understand the influence of structural modifications in the dithiocarbamate
skeleton with respect to the antifungal activity of the synthesized
brassinin analog results, it is important to perform successful new
bioactive agent designs.

In vitro antifungal activity, directly
tested on F. oxysporum mycelial growth
sensitivity, was assessed through a 12-well plate amended-medium method39 using a F. oxysporum isolate from Cape gooseberry. Five concentrations (between 10 and
300 μg/mL) were separately used to evaluate the antifungal activity
of all synthesized 5 and 6 series compounds.
Thus, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values were determined, which are listed in Tables 1 and 2. IC50 data for all test compounds were found to be within the 0.056–6.0
mM range. Some commercially available fungicides exhibit activity
on mycelial growth inhibition, with IC50 values of ca.
100 μg/mL.40,41 The present study included two
commercial antifungals, that is, mancozeb (a Mn/Zn dithiocarbamate
salt) and iprodione (an N-substituted hydantoin carboxamide).
The IC50 values of these antifungals were 0.031 and 0.043
mM, respectively. These facts indicated that the activity exhibited
by some synthetic N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamate
derivatives can therefore be considered promising (Table 2). In this sense, the results
also suggested a trend to enhance the antifungal activity against F. oxysporum upon performing structural modifications
in the 2-amino acid skeleton. As expected, alkyl 2-aminoesters 5a–5l have low activity (IC50 = 2.1–6.0 mM range, Table 1), but their functionalization toward N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamate-type compounds (6.1–6.36) led to better IC50 values (Table 2).
These results demonstrated the importance of the sulfur-containing
functional groups, that is, dithiocarbamates, as an important moiety/fragment
in antifungal agents to reach plausible biological interactions and
improve the fungal growth-related inhibition of test compounds.42 Several reports in the literature43,44 have proposed that this inhibition is due to the ability of the
dithiocarbamate residues to be rapidly absorbed by the mycelium of
the fungus. Then, isocyanates are generated, which react mainly with
the thiol groups of enzymes and metabolites of the cells, causing
alterations in the hyphae and interruptions in the supply of energy
to the fungal cells. A nonimportant bulky influence on antifungal
activity of substituent R2 in series 6 was
also suggested from results.

c Predicted from the CoMFA model.

However, a bulky group (R1) at C2 in 2-amino acid moiety
presumably reduces antifungal activity, which can vary slightly according
to the 2-amino acid precursor. Compounds derived from l-alanine, 6.1–6.12, showed higher antifungal activity
compared to compounds 6.13–6.36 derived
from l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine. The incidence
of (CX)–R moiety (X = O, N; R = Me, OMe) in the R–S(C=S)
alkyl fragment can be discussed according to the obtained results.
Within the compounds derived from l-alanine, compounds 6.1, 6.4, 6.8, and 6.11 showed the lowest IC50 values. These compounds are smaller
and of lower molecular weight due to the size of the substituent R1, which probably makes these types of molecules more easily
absorbed by the fungal cells, thus favoring their efficacy. The absorption
of larger dithiocarbamates may be diminished due to an impediment
to passing through the fungal wall and the plasma membrane. Additionally,
complementary metabolic steps are needed to hydrolyze larger substituents.

These compounds are differentiated by a nitrile group. The influence
of the CN group as a hydrogen bond acceptor and its strong dipole
(which enhances polar interactions) could explain our results upon
considering the intermolecular binding interactions with key residues
of the plausible active site in different functional target enzymes
of phytopathogens.45 Within the compounds
derived from l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, 6.13–6.36, the results showed a similar
tendency for l-alanine derivatives. However, compounds 6.17 and 6.20 (obtained upon using methyl acrylate)
also showed promising antifungal activity. The influence of the methoxycarbonyl
fragment could improve the interaction within the active site of functional
enzymes in the fungus metabolism due its electronic and structural
characteristics.46

Comparative Molecular Field
Analysis (CoMFA)
The structure–antifungal
activity relationship of synthetic compounds was reasonably explained
by a three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship
(3D-QSAR) study through a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA),
which was also performed. The dataset was expanded involving the close-related,
previously synthesized N,S-dithiocarbamates
from l-tryptophan29 in order to
include a wider range of antifungal activity values of the training
set compounds. A basic assumption in CoMFA models is that an appropriate
building of the steric and electrostatic fields around a set of aligned
molecules might provide all the information necessary for understanding
their biological activities.47 Therefore,
experimental antifungal data (as pIC50 values) and aligned structures were subdivided into a test set (30%)
and a training set (70%) for external validation and generating the
CoMFA model, respectively. The molecular interaction fields (MIFs)
were then calculated using probes (steric and electrostatic ones),
and after several steps of data pretreatment, partial least squares
(PLS) regression was carried out (using five PLS components) to build
linear relationships among variations in the MIF values as a function
of changes in the experimental pIC50.
After that, the best model required three PLS components, suggesting
good correlation between MIF values and the experimental pIC50 of test compounds. A statistically reliable, predictive
CoMFA model was then achieved from substructure-based alignment. Thus,
the model resulted in a conventional correlation coefficient r2 = 0.812, the cross-validated LOO coefficient q2 = 0.771, the cross-validated LMO coefficient q2 = 0.768, and the F-test value
of 122.876, demonstrating excellent parameters for a robust model.48 After the Y-scrambling procedure
(enlisting the observations randomly using 20 scramblings and 10 runs),
there was no correlation between MIF and activity datasets; hence,
the model decayed drastically. The mean Rscr2 and Qscr2 of
the first 50 iterations were lower than those of the cross-validated
model (Figure 2b),
indicating that the model is good and it was not achieved as a result
of a chance correlation.

Figure 2 (a) CoMFA predicted as experimental pIC50 values. (b) Plot of Y-scrambled Rscr2 and Qscr2 of each iteration (n = 50) compared
with
the cross-validated model (R2 and Q2).

According to this analysis, experimental and predicted activity
data for the whole compound set (Tables 1 and 2), expressed
as pIC50, and the corresponding plot (predicted
versus the experimental pIC50 values)
for the entire set of test compounds indicated good correlation for
both training and test datasets (experimental) and the predicted activity
values (theoretical) (Figure 2a). There was no evidence of outliers within the standard
deviation (i.e., 0.203), having normal residual values. Thus, the
predictability regarding the MIF values of promising antifungals can
be considered adequate because it exhibited an appropriate fit for
modeling the F. oxysporum mycelial
growth inhibition of these kinds of compounds. Blue dots represent
predictions for the training set; red dots represent predictions for
the test set. The CoMFA model also involved contributions of steric
and electrostatic fields of 61 and 33%, respectively. Thus, particular
contour surfaces of these field contributions (model stdev*coeff),
including test compounds from the CoMFA analysis, are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 (a) Steric and (b) electrostatic
maps from the CoMFA model including
test compounds. Green contours (32% contribution) show positions where
a bulky group would be favorable for higher antifungal activity. Yellow
contours (29% contribution) indicate positions where a decrease in
the bulk of the target molecules is favored. Blue contours (18% contribution)
encompass regions where an increase of positive charge will enhance
the activity. Red contoured areas (15% contribution) indicate that
more negative charges are favorable for the activity. (c) Scheme for
the steric and electrostatic contributions according to the CoMFA
model.

In the steric field contour map,
sterically favorable and unfavorable
regions are represented as green and yellow contours, respectively.
The green contours show positions where a bulky group might favor
higher antifungal activities, whereas the yellow contours indicate
positions where a decrease in the bulk of the target molecules is
favored. In this context, these contours let us determine that electron-withdrawing
groups attached to sulfur on the dithiocarbamate moiety could be replaced
by bulky groups to increase antifungal activity, as mentioned before
regarding CN and COOMe substituents. The bulky substitution at R2 (ester-forming alkyl group) did not favor antifungal activity,
indicating a preference for nonbulky 2-aminoester precursors. In contrast,
the activity was evidently favored when the 2-amino acid-derived moiety
had less bulky groups at R1 (amino acid side chain). Therefore,
compounds 6.1, 6.4, 6.7, 6.8, and 6.11 fit very well for these structural
requirements to be highly active as F. oxysporum mycelium growth inhibitors (IC50 < 80 μM).

Furthermore, potential electrostatic interactions also correlate
positively to antifungal activity involving desirable positive and
negative partial charges (blue and red contours, respectively) in
molecules to enhance the antifungal activity. These contours were
found to be distributed into two faces of the aligned molecules. This
can be rationalized suitably because electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)
(directly bonded to the dithiocarbamate moiety) evidently cause an
electron-deficient zone in this molecule region. Hence, the presence
of these negatively charged EWGs favored antifungal activity. Other
blue contours over the nitrogen and aromatic side chain (R1) suggest that electron-deficient substituents might also be favorable
to increase the activity. From all of these facts, these structural
features improve antifungal activity and should be considered in further
structural optimization studies to develop more potent antifungals.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported a high-yielding, green,
and fast ultrasound-assisted
synthesis of N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamates
derived from common 2-amino acids and electron-deficient olefins (Michael
acceptors) under mild conditions to produce antifungal compounds against
a problematic phytopathogen. Hence, the results for the in vitro antifungal
activity against F. oxysporum and the
respective 3D-QSAR analysis demonstrated the promising performance
(IC50 < 80 μM) of the synthesized compounds as
leads for the development of a novel class of F. oxysporum mycelial growth inhibitors based on this type of N,S-dialkyl dithiocarbamates. A relationship between
the structure and antifungal activity was demonstrated, involving
smaller side chains in alkyl 2-aminoester moieties (i.e., alanine)
and a cyanoethyl substitution as an EWG, which can be rationalized
by the efficient absorption ability through the wall of fungal hyphae,
enhancing/favoring antifungal activity. From these facts, further
studies are then required to discern the action mechanism of these
antifungal compounds. The most active compound was found to be (S)-ethyl 2-((2-cyanoethylthio)carbonothioylamino)propanoate
(6.4) (IC50 = 56 μM), which can be considered
as a promising antifungal agent to support the control of F. oxysporum as a crop pest.

Materials and Methods
General
Information
Entire set of reagents and chemicals
was commercially acquired (Merck KGaA and/or Sigma-Aldrich). They
were employed without additional refinement. The purity of dry solvents
was sufficiently defined during purchasing. Progression of reactions
and purifications of products were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck KGaA) under detection
at 254 nm. Ultrasound-assisted reactions were performed in an Elmasonic
S30H ultrasonic bath with 37 Hz of frequency. Silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063
mm mesh) (Merck KGaA) was used for CC. A Bruker Avance AV-400 MHz
spectrometer was employed for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments.
TMS was utilized as a reference to give chemical shifts in δ
(ppm). Typical splitting patterns were implemented to define the signal
multiplicity (i.e., s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet).
A Shimadzu Prominence HPLC module system was operated for HPLC runs,
employing a L2 column (Synergi HydroRP-C18, Phenomenex, 150 mm ×
4.6 mm × 4 μm) and a mobile phase containing a mixture
of 0.1% formic acid in water (B) and 1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(A), in gradient mode, at 1.5 mL/min (flow rate). A multiwavelength
diode array detector was used for UV detection (270 nm). A LC–MS
2020 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was utilized for recording mass
spectra in positive ion mode using electrospray ionization. A JASCO
P-2000 polarimeter (JASCO Co., Ltd., Japan) in a quartz cell (1.0
cm) was used for determining optical specific rotations of synthetic
compounds, expressed as mean values after 10 independent determinations.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Alkyl Esters 5a–5l
Compounds 5a–5l were prepared as previously illustrated30 after some modifications. To a solution of the respective
amino acid (1 mmol) previously dissolved in the corresponding aliphatic
alcohol (5.0 mL) was added dropwise trimethylsilane chloride (4 mmol).
The resulting mixture was heated under reflux and stirred for 4 h.
Subsequently, the heating was stopped, and this mixture was left until
room temperature. Solvent was then removed by vacuum distillation.
The crude reaction product was recrystallized from ethanol to obtain
the respective hydrochloride. Compounds 5a–5l were obtained as their amine form by treatment with a 10%
NaHCO3 and discontinuous liquid–liquid extraction
with ethyl acetate (5 × 10 mL). The synthetic compounds were
successfully characterized by electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)

General Procedure for the Synthesis of N,S-dialkyl Dithiocarbamates 6.1–6.36
For method A, compounds 6.1–6.36 were synthesized using the described
procedure in the
literature.29 Conventional CC was employed
for purifying the products. For method B via ultrasonic irradiation,
a mixture of the corresponding alkyl esters 5a–5l (1 mmol), carbon disulfide (1 mmol), the corresponding
Michael acceptor (1 mmol) (i.e., acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, or
mesityl oxide), and triethylamine (TEA, 1 mmol) in water (10 mL) was
placed in a Pyrex round-bottom flask coupled to reflux. The reaction
mixture was irradiated by ultrasound (37 kHz) using an Elmasonic E30H
sonicator (Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Germany) with an HF outpower of
240 W at room temperature during 1 h. TLC monitoring was implemented
using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether mixtures as mobile phases. Reduced
pressure was used for concentrating the reaction mixtures. Conventional
CC was employed for purifying the afforded products.

Antifungal Assay
Compounds 5a–5l and 6.1–6.36 were assessed
against F. oxysporum following the
previously reported 12-well plate amended-medium method to evaluate
the in vitro inhibition of mycelial growth.39 Mancozeb and iprodione were used as reference antifungals.

Comparative
Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA)
The 3D-QSAR
analysis was performed using open3dqsar package adopting some parameters
previously reported.49 Briefly, 3D structures
of all compounds were built in Marvin (ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary)
and minimized by using SPARTAN ’14 (Wavefunction, Irvine, CA,
USA) on a Dell Precision 7920 workstation. Geometries of compounds 5a–5l (precursors) and 6.1–6.36 (products) were fully optimized by using
the AM1 method. Lowest-energy conformations were then considered as
the bioactive conformations. AM1-derived molecular electrostatic potential
distribution was used as net atomic charges. All the nitrogen and
oxygen atoms were selected as tethers for substructure-based superimposing
within the automatic alignment procedure. Thus, these tethers led
us to superimpose all the compounds using an atom-by-atom least-squares
fitting as an option implemented in Discovery Studio Client (Biovia,
San Diego, CA, USA). The most active compound (i.e., 6.8) was selected as the reference molecule. Two subsets [i.e., test
(30%) and training (70%) sets] were randomly generated from the set
of aligned compounds. CoMFA descriptors, steric and electrostatic
field energies, were then computed using default parameters: 2 A°
grid point spacing, sp3 carbon probe atom (+1 charge),
minimum column filtering of 2.0 kcal mol–1, and
an energy cutoff of 30.0 kcal mol–1. The independent
variable was the antifungal activity (expressed as pIC50 values). Leave-one-out (LOO) and leave-many-out (LMO)
methods were employed for cross-validations. The independent variable
was predicted for the test set using high-quality validated models.
Thus, calculations of the r2, cross-validated q2, and F-test values from the
training dataset were used for the internally evaluation of the model
robustness. Finally, a Y-scrambling procedure was
implemented to demonstrate that the resulting model was not derived
from a random correlation after 20 scramblings, 5 groups, and 10 runs,
setting 0.85 as the critical point.50
