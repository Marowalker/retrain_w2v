For
the regeneration or creation of functional tissues, biodegradable
biomaterials including polylactic acid (PLA) are widely preferred.
Modifications of the material surface are quite common to improve
cell–material interactions and thereby support the biological
outcome. Typical approaches include a wet chemical treatment with
mostly hazardous substances or a functionalization with plasma. In
the present study, gas-phase fluorination was applied to functionalize
the PLA surfaces in a simple and one-step process. The biological
response including biocompatibility, cell adhesion, cell spreading,
and proliferation was analyzed in cell culture experiments with fibroblasts
L929 and correlated with changes in the surface properties. Surface
characterization methods including surface energy and isoelectric
point measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force
microscopy were applied to identify the effects of fluorination on
PLA. Gas-phase fluorination causes the formation of C–F bonds
in the PLA backbone, which induce a shift to a more hydrophilic and
polar surface. The slightly negatively charged surface dramatically
improves cell adhesion and spreading of cells on the PLA even with
low fluorine content. The results indicate that this improved biological
response is protein- but not integrin-dependent. Gas-phase fluorination
is therefore an efficient technique to improve cellular response to
biomaterial surfaces without losing cytocompatibility.

Introduction
The biocompatibility of a biomaterial
is particularly influenced
by its ability to support cellular activity. Cell adhesion to a biomaterial
surface is a key parameter for the successful application of a material
especially in the field of tissue engineering.1,2 Proliferation,
migration, and differentiation of cells are regulated by signals stimulated
by cell surface interactions.3,4 Consequently, manipulating
surface properties to improve cell adhesion represents an important
aspect in biomaterial research.

Biodegradable polymers are widely
used as two- or three-dimensional
substrates for cell growth because they show suitable mechanical properties,
transparency, and low immunogenicity. In particular, polylactic acid
(PLA) has been extensively studied for biomedical applications.5 In contrast to the advantageous bulk properties,
the surface properties of such polymers are usually not cell-friendly.
Hydrophobicity, low surface energy, and lack of active functional
groups at the surface lead to poor cell adhesion, cell spreading,
and proliferation.6 In order to facilitate
cell attachment, various methods have been developed to improve surface
wettability, surface energy, surface charge, and chemical composition.
Common strategies include coating with bioactive proteins, introducing
functional groups, or nanostructuring7 at
the surface of biodegradable polymers. For this purpose, many different
approaches are available: wet chemical treatment, peroxide oxidation,
high-energy radiation,8 and plasma treatment.9,10

Chemical treatments are quite harsh and can worsen bulk properties
such as mechanical strength and degradation rate. During low-temperature
plasma treatment using process gases such as nitrogen, ammonia, argon,
helium, or oxygen, functional groups with different polarities are
incorporated or cross-linked via free radicals, and changes of surface
morphology can be induced.8 Plasma treatment
on PLA, for example, results in increased hydrophilicity and moderately
wettable surfaces. In addition, protein adsorption, cellular attachment,
and spreading are improved.11−13 However, plasma treatment does
not offer long-term stability and the surface tends to recover within
weeks.14

Direct gas-phase fluorination
is a completely different process
to modify the surface properties. This process is widely used to improve
adhesion,15 printability, barrier properties,
gas separation properties,16 friction coefficients,17 antibacterial properties,18 UV shield, and chemical resistance19 of polymers. Direct fluorination of polymers is a heterogeneous
reaction in the presence of fluorine (F2) and other gases,
resulting in a radical chain reaction at the surface of the material.
It starts with the spontaneous formation of fluorine radicals which
disrupt C–H bonds and form new C–F, C–F2, and C–F3 groups. A total fluorination (Teflon-like
structure) results in strong hydrophobic surfaces and requires treatment
times of several weeks or months.16 However,
in most cases, the polymer chain is not fully fluorinated. Partially
fluorinated surfaces show increased polarity and improved wettability.
In the presence of oxygen, a so-called oxyfluorination takes place.
The formation of oxygen-containing, polar surface functionalities
is seen as the cause for improved wettability.20 However, the incorporation of fluorine atoms itself induces
an increase in the dielectric constant, resulting in a higher polarity
too.21,22

The process of gas-phase fluorination
does not require pretreatment
and can be performed at room temperature (RT), which is important
for temperature-sensitive materials. In addition, the effects are
stable over months.15

As far as we
know, gas-phase fluorination has not been used to
date to influence the surface properties of implant materials or biodegradable
polymers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects
of fluorinated PLA surfaces on cell compatibility, cell adhesion,
and proliferation and to correlate the biological response with surface
properties.

Results
The PLA films treated with different fluorine
concentrations showed
no obvious changes concerning optical appearance and handling. Several
characterization methods were applied to investigate how the surface
of PLA was affected by the treatment.

Surface Properties
At first, the chemical composition
of the PLA surface after gas-phase fluorination was investigated.
The elemental composition was measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Figure 1 shows
the XPS wide spectra of PLA films without fluorination, fluorination
with 5 and 10 vol % fluorine in the reactor. The concentration of
the elements fluorine, oxygen, and carbon was calculated as atomic
percent and expressed as fluorine to carbon F/C or oxygen to carbon
O/C ratio.

Figure 1 XPS wide spectra of PLA films without fluorination (black) and
fluorination with 5 vol % fluorine in the reactor (red) and 10 vol
% fluorine in the reactor (blue), purging gas: nitrogen.

Fluorine and oxygen concentrations depending on the fluorine
concentration
and the purging gas in the reactor are shown in Figure 2B,C. XPS analyses revealed that the incorporation
of fluorine differs significantly with the purging gas used. In the
presence of nitrogen, more fluorine is bound to the polymer surface
compared to purging gas containing oxygen. Additionally, low fluorine
concentrations in the reactor resulted in slight incorporation into
the PLA surface. Samples treated with the highest fluorine concentration
(10%), however, showed a significant increase in fluorine content.
The incorporation is obviously not linear to the fluorine concentration
in the reactor. A maximum of approximately 25% of fluorine atoms in
relation to the carbon atoms was found in the presence of nitrogen.
The oxygen concentration does not change significantly, neither with
increasing fluorine concentration nor as a function of the purge gas.

Because of the different fluorine contents that appeared after
gas-phase fluorination, it was possible to analyze a biological response
in a dose-dependent manner (low to high fluorine content at the surface
of PLA). In order to better understand the effects of the treatment,
the following data were referred to the fluorine concentration at
the surface of the material and not to the reactor concentration during
the treatment.

A biological response to a surface is strongly
influenced by hydrophobicity
and surface charge. In order to characterize the effects of gas-phase
fluorination on PLA, the contact angle, the surface energy, and the
isoelectric point (IEP) were measured (Figure 3 and Table 1).

a Significance
between untreated PLA
and fluorinated PLA at the corresponding concentration.

Compared to untreated PLA, only
a slight decrease of the water
contact angle (WCA) (as a measure of hydrophilicity) and polarity
could be observed with a fluorine–carbon ratio (F/C ratio)
≤0.15. A fluorine content >0.15 results in an abrupt decrease
of the WCA and an increase in surface polarity. The surface of PLA
after fluorination changes from predominantly hydrophobic to moderately
hydrophobic, which means that the wettability increases.

Modifications
of the surface can also result in changes in the
number or composition of charged functional groups. Measuring the
IEP helps to identify such modifications. Figure 3E shows the IEPs of PLA surfaces with the
different fluorine concentrations. The IEP shifts toward the lower
pH values, which indicates an increase in negative charges on the
PLA surface.

The data suggest that the surface properties of
PLA change to less
hydrophobic, more polar, and more negative charges after fluorination.
In order to prove whether this has any effect on the cellular behavior,
the material was analyzed in cell culture experiments.

Biological
Response to Fluorinated PLA
In order to
exclude any toxic effect of fluorination on cells, the metabolic activity
of L929 fibroblast cells was investigated using the XTT assay. The
cells were analyzed after a 2 day incubation with treated or untreated
PLA films. None of the fluorine concentrations reduced the metabolic
activity below 80%, proving that fluorination does not significantly
affect the cytocompatibility. Next, the adhesion of cells to the surface
of treated PLA was analyzed. Therefore, L929 fibroblast cells were
seeded on top of the PLA films. After a short incubation time, attached
cells were measured and compared with cells seeded on the untreated
PLA films. As shown in Figure 4B, a significantly higher number of adherent cells could be
detected on fluorinated PLA surfaces. The number further increased
with rising fluorine concentration. Next, the cell adhesion in the
presence and absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was analyzed to evaluate
the influence of proteins in this setting. L929 fibroblasts were seeded
on untreated and fluorinated PLA using culture media with 10% of FBS
and without FBS. The effect of the improved cell adhesion on fluorinated
surfaces was completely lost without serum (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Metabolic activity (A) after 48 h, adhesion
(B) with 10% FBS (●)
and without FBS (◯) (30 min), cell spreading (C) after 2 h,
and proliferation (D) (24 h) of L929 fibroblasts after incubation
on PLA films with different fluorination degrees (post hoc significance
test, Holm–Bonferroni).

Additionally, analyses of cell spreading showed a clear difference
between treated and untreated PLA (Figures 4C, 5). The cell spreading
area was considerably higher on treated surfaces compared to untreated
PLA. Similar to cell adhesion, cell spreading was influenced in a
fluorine-concentration-dependent manner. In order to investigate if
the improved adhesion and spreading to fluorinated PLA surfaces also
influences cell proliferation, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
analyses were performed. As Figure 4D shows, no significant increase in cellular proliferation
could be detected.

Figure 5 Spreading of L929 fibroblasts 1 h and 24 h after seeding
on untreated
(left) and fluorinated (middle, right) PLA surfaces. Cells were stained
with DAPI (blue) and phalloidin-TRITC (orange). Scale bar: 20 μm.

It appeared that fluorination promotes adhesion
and spreading of
cells on the PLA material. There is a correlation between the decrease
in hydrophobicity, the increase in polarity, and the number of negative
charges at the surface. However, the increase in cell adhesion and
spreading at low fluorine concentrations are higher than the gradient
of the change of the surface properties. However, metabolic activity
and proliferation of the cells are not affected. In the following,
more detailed analyses regarding the chemical composition and the
surface structure were performed to identify possible reasons for
those effects.

Chemical Composition of the PLA Surface after
Fluorination
In order to characterize the chemical bonds
at the PLA surface,
high-resolution spectra of carbon and oxygen were analyzed using XPS.
The C 1s spectra of untreated PLA samples showed three peaks: C–C
or C–H, C–O, and O–C=O (Figure 6B). As the degree of fluorination
increases, the proportion of C–C and C–H bonds decreases
(Figure 6E). The C–F
peaks are masked by the C–O and O–C=O peaks.
At the highest fluorine concentration, a shift to higher binding energies
and a broadening of the C–O and O–C=O peaks can
be monitored. Unfolding of the C 1s peak with further peak components
was not effective because no clear distinction can be made between
the C–O and O–C=O peaks because of the superposition
of C–O and O–C=O peaks with C–F peaks.
New peaks, such as those observed with fluorination of polyethylene,15 did not appear.

of fluorinated and untreated PLA depending on the fluorine concentration
at the surface (●: C–C, C–H; △: C–O,
C–CF; □: O–C=O, and CF–CF).

The O 1s spectra of oxygen showed two oxygen bonds
(C–O
and O–C=O) (Figure 6C). No changes could be observed after fluorination,
indicating that the increase in the proportion of the C–O/C–F
peaks in Figure 6D
can be attributed to an increase in C–F bonds.

The detailed
spectra of fluorine show two peaks in the fluorinated
samples. The proportion of functional groups containing fluorine rises
with increasing fluorine concentration in the reactor (Figure 6E).

Obviously, fluorination
results in the replacement of hydrogen
by fluorine atoms. The formation of functional groups such as carboxyl
or hydroxyl groups could not be affirmed.

Surface Roughness
The roughness of treated and untreated
PLA was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). No differences
appeared after fluorination (Figure 7), indicating that the surface structure is not the
reason for increased cell adhesion.

Figure 7 Three-dimensional projection of the AFM
height images and roughness
of untreated and fluorinated PLA surfaces measured with AFM.

Protein Adsorption
The cell adhesion
studies revealed
that the improved attachment to fluorinated PLA ceases in the absence
of FBS. In order to prove whether protein adsorption plays a role
in this setting, the binding of two different model protein solutions
[bovine serum albumin (BSA) and FBS] to PLA was investigated. The
proteins were incubated at the surface of PLA samples for 20 min at
37 °C, desorbed with 2% of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 95
°C, and measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. As
shown in Figure 8,
adsorption of the proteins was not significantly affected at low fluorine
concentrations (F/C < 0.15). However, the binding sharply increased
at concentrations F/C > 0.15 similar to the increase in hydrophilicity
and polarity.

content
after 20 min.

Integrin-Dependent Cell
Adhesion
Usually, integrin
receptors play a crucial role in the adhesion of cells to a biomaterial.
In order to analyze whether integrins are important for the increased
adhesion to fluorinated PLA, cells were incubated with antibodies
against those receptors. The integrin function is then switched off.
Cell adhesion experiments were performed in the presence of blocking
antibodies against integrin subunits β1, α5, and α2β
and compared to vehicle [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] and isotype
control (Figure 9).
In the presence of integrin-blocking antibodies, the cells showed
a slightly but not significantly reduced adhesion to treated and untreated
PLA samples, indicating that integrins are involved in the cellular
attachment to PLA. However, the amplified adhesion to fluorinated
surfaces remained, indicating that integrins are not involved in the
elevated level of adhesion to fluorinated PLA.

(■) and fluorinated [□]

to integrin subunits β1, α5, and α2β and a
mixture (Mix) of all three antibodies were used with a final concentration
of 10 μg/mL.

Discussion
PLA
is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester which is biodegradable
and biocompatible. These properties play an important role for applications
in medicine. A disadvantage of PLA, which restricts the medical use,
is the hydrophobicity of the surface and the absence of specific functional
groups for adhesion and growth of cells.8 Therefore, surface properties of PLA have to be modified to enhance
the cell–material interactions. An effective approach to modify
the surface is the direct fluorination. This process enables a one-step
functionalization and proceeds at practically acceptable rates at
RT. Because fluorination is one of the most effective dry chemical
methods to modify and control physicochemical properties of polymers
over a wide range of applications, this process has become an important
tool of great interest.23 Compared to other
fluorination strategies such as fluorination with hydrofluoric acid
(HF),24 the process is less hazardous (including
no skin contact and no inhalation) because it takes place in a closed
reactor system and excess fluorine is added to calcium carbonate reacting
into the nontoxic, environmentally neutral, and water-insoluble mineral
CaF2.

In general, the chemical composition and the
properties of fluorinated
surfaces depend on experimental conditions (time, temperature, pressure,
partial pressure of F2, and composition of gaseous mixture)
and the nature of the polymer material. In the presence of oxygen,
the −COF groups can be formed, which can be converted into
−COOH groups under atmospheric moisture conditions.23 In the present study, XPS analyses of fluorinated
PLA films confirm an incorporation of fluorine into the polymer chain
of PLA. The fluorine concentration in the reactor <7.7% results
in a weak fluorine content at the surface. By using 9.8% of fluorine
in the reactor, the amount of fluorine in the backbone of PLA increases
significantly. About 25% of the carbon atoms at the surface were bound
to fluorine atoms. With oxygen-containing purging gas, the amount
of incorporated fluorine is reduced. This is in line with the literature,
showing that the presence of oxygen inhibits the incorporation of
fluorine in polymer backbones.25 Evaluation
of the C 1s detailed spectra shows that the C–H bonds decrease
with increasing fluorine concentration. Unfortunately, the binding
energies of the C–O bonds and C–F bonds overlap so that
it is not possible to quantify the C–F bonds. Nevertheless,
the results of the XPS investigations suggest that hydrogen atoms
in the polymer chain are replaced by fluorine atoms. Neither the C
1s nor the O 1s spectra show any change in the C–O bonds. The
formation of additional oxygen-containing functionalities can therefore
not be assumed.

The detailed spectrum of F 1s showed two peaks.
The reason for
this could not be clarified. F 1s peak shapes are normally symmetrical.
Fluorine tends to induce large chemical shifts in other elements,
but within a given class of fluorine compounds (metal fluoride or
organic fluorine), the shifts in the F 1s peak are small. In addition,
it is known that in different polymers, fluorine has different binding
energies.26 A higher degree of fluorination
(F/C > 0.5) induces a shift of the binding energy to higher values.27 The presence of inorganic fluorine is unlikely
because no other elements can be detected in the overview spectra.

With increasing fluorine concentration at the PLA surface, the
hydrophilicity and the polarity of the PLA surface increases, but
not linearly. Both rise weakly in the range of low fluorine concentrations
and strongly at higher concentrations. Additionally, the change of
the IEP to lower pH values indicates an increase in negative charges.
XPS analyses of fluorinated PLA in the present study indicate no additional
oxygen-containing groups at the surface. The reason for the increased
polarity and wettability is probably not oxygen but simply the incorporation
of the very electronegative fluorine. Fluorine leads to a polarization
of the C–F bond, the covalent characteristic decreases, and
the electrostatic properties increase. Therefore, the fluorine atom
in a C–F bond interacts with other molecules via electrostatic
dipole interactions.28 While in partially
fluorinated carbon compounds water molecules interact with the surface
via a strong electric field,21 100% of
fluorination (Teflon) leads to such a strong decrease in the electric
field that water molecules can no longer interact with those types
of surfaces (“polar hydrophobicity”).29

Often, the functionalization of polymer surfaces
has profound effects
on their biological response. The interaction of a biomaterial surface
with the surrounding tissue after implantation can be divided into
different phases: during the first stage, a water shell is formed
on the surface of the material. Second, a layer of plasma proteins
is adsorbed. During the third stage, the cells reach the implant and
interact with the implant and the protein coating. Protein adsorption
is a complex process of adsorption, desorption, competition between
different proteins, rearrangements, and conformational changes over
a period of time.30 Proteins tend to adhere
more strongly to nonpolar than to polar surfaces, to areas with high
surface tension than those with low surface tension, and to charged
surfaces than to uncharged surfaces. A rather general experimental
finding is an increase in adsorption on hydrophobic surfaces compared
to hydrophilic surfaces.31

In general,
cells bind to extracellular matrix or adsorbed proteins
through cell membrane receptors. One class of receptors include integrins,
which bind selectively to specific binding sites such as the Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) tripeptide found in cell adhesive extracellular proteins such
as vitronectin, laminin, and fibronectin. In addition, these focal
adhesions formed by the integrin extracellular protein interaction
stimulate signals that directly influence proliferation, migration,
and differentiation of cells.15

The
present study could show that cell adhesion and cell spreading
in a range up to an F/C ratio of 0.25 can be significantly improved
by fluorination. Protein adsorption was found to be increased at F/C
ratios >0.15. The latter can be attributed to the amplification
of
wettability, the increase in polarity, and the introduction of negative
charges, although the relationship is not linear. However, the cells
analyzed in the present study seem to be more sensitive to surface
modifications than the physically measurable surface properties. In
the presence of proteins, cells adhered much better to fluorinated
PLA even at low fluorine content at the surface. On the other hand,
in the absence of proteins (FBS), improved cellular adhesion to fluorinated
PLA surfaces could not be detected anymore.

A correlation between
improved cell adhesion of human fibroblasts
and reduced hydrophobicity of plasma-modified PLA surfaces has been
found, for example, by Jacobs et al.11 However,
the effects were not stable over a period of time. Alves et al.12 could show that a treatment of PLA with oxygen
radio frequency glow discharge (RFGD) increases the hydrophilicity
and the number of functional groups. This improved the adsorption
of various proteins including vitronectin, BSA, and fibronectin from
single protein solutions. In the absence of preadsorbed proteins,
osteoblast-like cells and fetal rat calvarial cells showed no improved
adhesion after surface treatment anymore similar to the present study.12 The relationship between wettability (hydrophilicity),
protein adsorption, and cell adhesion is discussed extensively. In
a series of studies, Tamada and Ikada were able to show for numerous
different polymers that moderately hydrophobic surfaces with WCAs
between 60 and 70° are optimal for protein adsorption and cell
adhesion.32,33 In contrast, Faucheux et al.34 could show that adsorption of fibronectin and
formation of focal contacts via the integrin β1 subunit are
particularly pronounced on moderately hydrophobic surfaces.

The results of the present study are similar to all these observations.
Although an increased protein mass deposition with F/C < 0.15 could
not be quantified using the BCA assay, the reason for the improved
cell adhesion is probably an enhanced binding of proteins to the fluorinated
PLA surfaces. Protein adsorption studies performed by Khalifehzadeh
et al.35 showed that the amount of protein
remaining after desorption of fluorinated surfaces is significantly
increased compared to that of untreated surfaces. Analyses of proteins
remaining at the surface were not performed in the present study.
The cell adhesion experiments revealed two further unexpected results.
First of all, adhesion of L929 fibroblasts to untreated PLA in serum-free
media was similar to control conditions (with serum). Indeed, Grinnell
and Feld36 described similar effects with
human skin fibroblasts and found that fibroblasts secrete and expose
fibronectin at the cell surface, thereby enabling cellular adhesion
in the absence of serum. Second, the cells analyzed in the present
study did not respond to fluorination in the absence of serum. The
mechanism behind this is unknown. Integrin receptors are obviously
not involved in the improved adhesion to fluorinated PLA because integrin
blocking did not have an effect apart from a slightly reduced adhesion
in both settings (untreated and fluorinated PLA). Lee et al.37 reported a very low adhesion rate to PLA of
<10% in the presence of integrin β1 blocking for mesenchymal
stem cells and chondrocytes. However, other cells including primary
endothelial cells and tumor cell lines were also tested in the present
study. No reduction of cellular adhesion in the presence of integrin-blocking
antibodies was observed (data not shown). There are some hints that
the initial adhesion of cells to charged surfaces is regulated via
integrin-dependent but also integrin-independent mechanisms.38 Perhaps fluorinated PLA enables an additional
opportunity for cells to bind to the surface via an integrin-independent,
probably charge-dependent, mechanism.

An influence of the surface
roughness on cell adhesion is well
described.39,40 The present study did not measure
any changes of the surface roughness.

In contrast to plasma
treatment and oxygen RFGD, the main advantage
of gas-phase fluorination is its long-term stability.15 Incorporation of fluorine did not affect the cytocompatibility
of the material. Although cellular proliferation was not accelerated,
an increase in adhesion and spreading of cells at fluorinated PLA
surfaces can have a significant impact on the therapeutic success
of an implant.

In addition to cytocompatibility, biodegradability
of the fluorinated
PLA is also probably not affected. It has not yet been investigated
so far, but the changes in the polymer backbone are restricted to
the PLA surface. The present study measured a maximum degree of fluorination
of F/C = 0.3, which means that only at the surface of the PLA, a maximum
of 30% of all carbon atoms are bound to a fluorine atom instead of
a hydrogen atom. Thus, the bulk material is left unchanged. The hydrolysis-sensitive
ester bond O–C=O most likely remains unaffected.

Polymers can also be fluorinated using wet chemical treatments.
Chen et al.,24 for example, studied fluorinated
PEEK (polyetheretherketone) for dental applications. Incorporation
of fluorine into the polymer surface was performed using plasma, followed
by HF treatment. The authors observed an increase in cell adhesion,
spreading, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase activity of rat
bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The fluorinated material
also showed in vitro bacteriostatic effects and an enhancement of
in vivo osseointegration. However, the fluorination process used is
laborious and requires hazardous chemicals. Similarly, in a study
of Khalifehzadeh et al.,35 a multistep
process including the radio frequency plasma treatment followed by
a chemical addition of a perfluoro compound was used to improve the
hemocompatibility of PLA. An increase in protein adsorption and a
reduced binding of platelets to the material could be shown. Compared
to these procedures, the use of gaseous fluorine in gas mixtures applied
in a closed reactor is much easier to handle and to be automatized.

Conclusions
The results show that direct gas-phase fluorination is a simple,
well-feasible method to improve the PLA cytocompatibility, in particular
cellular adhesion and spreading. The partial exchange of hydrogen
atoms by more electronegative fluorine atoms makes the surface more
hydrophilic and polar. This creates a surface with optimized properties
for protein adsorption and cell adhesion to PLA.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of PLA Films
The PLA granulate (IngeoTM
Biopolymer 6202D, NatureWorks LLC, Minnetonka, USA) was dried at 50
°C overnight in a vacuum oven and stored in a desiccator. A defined
weight of granulate was pressed with a mechanical press (PW 40EH,
Paul-Otto Weber GmbH, Remshalden, Germany) at 20 kN and 185 °C
into films with a thickness of approximately 20 μm. In order
to avoid agglutination of the metal stamp and the PLA films, a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated
glass fabric separating film was used. The surface of the PLA films
was cleaned with isopropanol.

Gas-Phase Fluorination
of PLA Films
Gas-phase fluorination
was performed in a batch reactor (Fluor Technik System GmbH, Lauterbach,
Germany). Therefore, the PLA films were placed in the reactor at RT.
Prior to fluorination, the reactor was purged three times either with
nitrogen or with synthetic air. During fluorination, the reactor was
filled with a mixture of synthetic air or nitrogen and fluorine gas
(10% in nitrogen, Air Liquide, Paris, France). Fluorine concentrations
of 2.2, 5.6, 7.7, and 9.8 vol % in nitrogen or air mixtures were tested.
The overall pressure was 10, 18, 36, and 550 mbar with a reaction
time of 60 s. At the end of the reaction, the fluorine gas was replaced
by synthetic air or nitrogen lasting 30 min. For each fluorine condition
(fluorine concentration, purging gas), a minimum of four independent
replicates were prepared.

Contact Angle and Surface Energy
Static contact angles
were measured using an optical contact angle measuring and contour
analysis system (OCA35, Data Physics, Filderstadt, Germany). Drops
of three liquids with different polarities (water and ethylene glycol
as polar liquids and diiodomethane as a nonpolar liquid) were placed
on a sample and recorded (seven drops per measurement point). The
contact angles were calculated using the ellipse fitting method. The
surface free energy was calculated according to Owens, Wendt, Rabel,
and Kaelble (OWRK)41 using the contact
angles of all three liquids. The surface free energy was divided into
a polar and a disperse part.

XPS Characterization
XPS analyses
were performed with
the Kratos Axis Ultra (Kratos, Manchester, Great Britain) using an
Al-Kα monochromatic source (15 keV) at 225 W. Areas (300 ×
700 μm) of each location were measured. Wide and detailed spectra
were recorded and fitted using the instrument software. Charges were
neutralized using the Kratos magnetic confinement charge compensation
system. Spectra have been charge-corrected to the main line of the
carbon 1s spectrum and set to 284.6 eV. Fluorine concentration and
high-resolution spectra were measured at six different locations per
sample.

Isoelectric Point
The IEP was measured by determining
the zeta potential as a function of the pH value in a Surpass electrokinetic
analyzer (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria). Aqueous potassium chloride solution
(1 mM) was used as the electrolyte medium. Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solutions were used to adjust
the pH value. The samples were glued on two stamps forming a flow
channel of approximately 100 μm. The electrolytes were pumped
passing the sample surfaces with a pressure ramp (maximum 300 mbar).
The resulting charges were measured with electrodes at the start and
the end of the flow channel. The zeta potentials were calculated according
to the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski equation (eq 1)42 from the streaming
current. 1  where ζ denotes the zeta potential,
and η, ε0, and ε denote the viscosity,
vacuum permittivity, and dielectric constant of the electrolyte solution,
respectively. ζ = 0 represents the IEP. The IEP was measured
as duplicate.

Surface Roughness
The surface roughness
was determined
using the NanoWizard III atomic force microscope (Bruker JPK Instruments
AG BioAFM, Berlin, Germany) under ambient conditions and silicon cantilevers
(Pointprobe NCH, NanoWorld AG, Neuchâtel, Switzerland). The
cantilever parameters were as follows: resonance frequency ω0 ≈ 308 kHz, tip radius <8 nm, half opening angle
α = 35°, and spring constant k = 24 N/m
(determined as in ref (43)). For roughness measurements, an area of 10 × 10 μm2 was imaged with amplitude-modulated AFM (AM-AFM) using a
free amplitude A0 = 45 nm and a set point A/A0 = 0.75. The route-mean-square
roughness of the AM-AFM height images was analyzed using the Gwyddion
software.

Protein Adsorption
The PLA films with a diameter of
13 mm were incubated in a BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) solution
(100 μg/mL) or FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, 10% in PBS w/Ca++, Mg++) solution for 20 min at 37 °C. The supernatant
was discarded and the films were washed three times with distilled
water and dried. Afterward, samples were incubated in 200 μL
of PBS (w/Ca++, Mg++, Sigma-Aldrich) with 2%
SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) into nonbinding reaction vessels
(Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria) for 20 min at 95 °C
with shaking to detach the proteins from the surface. The protein
content in the solution was finally determined using the Pierce BCA
(bicinchoninic acid) protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
USA) and standard curves of diluted BSA solutions (in PBS w/Ca++, Mg++).

Cell Cultivation
L929 murine fibroblasts
(CLS Cell
Lines Service GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany) were grown as monolayer cultures
in T75 flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing
5% of CO2 and with a relative humidity of 95%. The L929
cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium/Ham’s F12 (50:50) medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% of FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% of l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were subcultured twice a week using 0.05% trypsin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, USA). The cell number was determined with a Neubauer
counting chamber (Paul Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany).
For experiments, cells were plated in triplicates in 24-well or 96-well
plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria).

Cell Adhesion
Assay
PLA films were immersed in 70%
of ethanol for 30 min and air-dried. Test wells of 24-well plates
were covered with fluorinated and untreated PLA films and incubated
with culture media (with or without FBS) for 30 min at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator. The L929 cells (4.2 × 105 cells/cm2) were added and incubated for at least
20 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2. After a sufficient incubation time (at least 20 min), unattached
cells were separated from bound cells using a multistep pipette (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany). Therefore, culture media were carefully removed
and the wells were washed with PBS (w/Ca++, Mg++) with a constant volume and pressure. Afterward, PBS was discarded
and cells were lysed with 200 μL of phosphatase lysis buffer
(81 mM trisodium citrate, 31 mM citric acid, 0.1% Triton X100, 1.85
mg/mL of PNP [4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate] substrate,
pH 5.4). The reaction was stopped using 133 μL of 2 M NaOH,
and 250 μL of supernatant was transferred in a 96-well plate
and absorption was measured at 405 nm using a plate reader (SpectraMax
i3x, Molecular Devices, San José, USA). Cellular adhesion to
untreated PLA was set to 100%. All samples were analyzed in triplicates.

Cell Spreading
PLA films were immersed in 70% of ethanol
for 30 min and air-dried. The 24-well plates were covered with fluorinated
and untreated PLA films and incubated with culture media for 30 min
at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. L929 cells (3.2 ×
105 cells/cm2) were added and incubated at the
surface of the PLA films for 1 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing
5% of CO2. The media were discarded and the cells were
fixed with 3% of paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)
for 30 min at RT. The fixed cells were washed three times with PBS
and permeabilized using 0.1% of Triton X100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA) in PBS for 10 min at RT. After two washing steps with
PBS, the cells were stained with phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, USA) for 1 h at RT in the dark. The spreading area of the
cells was determined using microscopic images at 100-fold magnification
and ImageJ software. Untreated PLA represented 100%. In one experiment,
three wells per sample were analyzed with three microscopic images
per well.

BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay
The
PLA films were immersed
in 70% of ethanol for 30 min and air-dried. Fluorinated and untreated
PLA films were placed in 96-well plates and incubated with culture
media for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The
L929 cells (1.8 × 105/cm2) were added to
each well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing
5% of CO2. Cell proliferation was determined using the
BrdU assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche
Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). In brief, BrdU labeling solution
was added to the cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After fixing and denaturing the cells, the incorporated
BrdU was detected using the anti-BrdU-POD working and substrate solution.
The BrdU fluorescence signal was measured at 370 nm (reference 492
nm) using a plate reader (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, San José,
USA). The signal of cells on untreated films was defined as 100%.
All samples were analyzed in triplicates.

XTT Cytotoxicity Test
A cytotoxicity test was performed
according to DIN EN ISO 10993-5. In brief, L929 cells (2.6 ×
105 cells/cm2) were plated in 24-well plates
in a culture medium without phenol red and incubated at standard cultivation
conditions (37 °C, 5% of CO2). After 24 h, the medium
was replaced by a fresh culture medium (without phenol red), and fluorinated
and untreated PLA films were carefully placed on top of the cell layer.
The cells were incubated again for 24 h at standard cultivation conditions.
On the following day, the metabolic activity of cells was analyzed
using the PromoKine XTT Colorimetric Cell Viability Kit III (Promocell
GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The assay was performed according to the
protocol of the manufacturer. In brief, cells were incubated with
XTT reagent under standard cultivation until the dye appeared (around
2 h). Thereafter, 100 μL of the medium containing the dye was
transferred in a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured in a plate
reader at 450 nm (reference 620 nm). The blank value (well with medium,
but without cells) was subtracted from the optical density values
of the samples. Cells without PLA (no sample) were defined as 100%
viable. All samples were analyzed in triplicates.

Integrin Blocking
Integrin-dependent cell adhesion
was measured as described by Mould.44 In
brief, L929 cells were detached from culture flasks using Accutase
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and incubated with antibodies against
different integrin subunits (anti-integrin β1 [P5D2], Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, USA; anti-integrin α5 [P1D6], Abcam,
Cambridge, Great Britain; anti-integrin α2β1 [P1E6], Abcam,
Cambridge, Great Britain; diluted in PBS [w/Ca++, Mg++]; and a final concentration of 10 μg/mL per well)
in a culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.
PLA films were placed in 96-well plates, washed with 100 μL
of PBS, and covered with a 50–100 μL cell suspension–antibody
mixture containing 150 000 cells/mL. After 15 min, cell adhesion
was analyzed as described before (cell adhesion assay). An isotype
control (mouse anti-rat IgG, Jackson) and the vehicle (PBS) were used
as controls. Cellular adhesion to untreated PLA in the presence of
PBS was set to 100%. All samples were analyzed in triplicates.

Statistical
Analysis
Experiments were performed with
a minimum of four independent replicates. The mean values of the technical
replicates were used to perform an analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA)
with a significance level of p = 0.05 and a post
hoc test according to Holm–Bonferroni (paired mean value comparison
with adjusted significance level).
