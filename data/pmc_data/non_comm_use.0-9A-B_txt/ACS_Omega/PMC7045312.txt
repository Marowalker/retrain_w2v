We
report on the structural and optical properties of Fe2CrO4+δ epitaxial films grown by molecular beam epitaxy
on MgAl2O4 (001) as a function of δ (average
cation valence). The average Fe valence is linked to the out-of-plane
lattice parameter and the extent of light absorption in the infrared
spectral region. Over-oxidized films (0 < δ < 0.5) exhibit
smaller lattice parameters and suppressed infrared absorption. The
lattice parameter is found to differ for films of equivalent oxidation
state but different thermal histories. We discuss the behavior of
a novel infrared transition present at ∼0.6 eV in Fe2CrO4 films deposited at or above 400 °C. An optical
transition found in all films at 0.9 eV independent of the synthesis
temperature can be used to quantify the oxidation state of Fe2CrO4+δ. This research provides new insights
into the atomic structure, optical processes, oxidation states, electronic
structure, and application potential of Fe2CrO4+δ.

Introduction
Fe2CrO4+δ exhibits attractive optical,
electronic, and magnetic properties which make it potentially useful
for energy conversion, magnetic memory, and spintronic applications.1−4 However, it is not known how this material behaves as a function
of the oxygen content (δ). Understanding material properties
as a function of the oxidation state, especially for transition-metal
oxides, is of utmost importance. It is common to misinterpret material
properties because the assumed oxidation state has not been confirmed
by measurements. Quantifying the oxidation state of a thin-film sample
can be difficult. We discuss a process adapted from other transition-metal
oxides5−7 to easily quantify the oxidation states in Fe2CrO4+δ.

Fe2CrO4 is compositionally half way between
the mineral end members Fe3O4 (magnetite) and
FeCr2O4 (chromite). Oxygen-stoichiometric Fe2CrO4 is the only intermediate compound that has
been previously targeted and analyzed for its functional properties.
Fe2CrO4 is a semiconductor that absorbs visible
light and exhibits photoconductivity.3 It
is a ferrimagnet with a Curie temperature well above ambient.3 These functional properties are expected to depend
on cation valences as they do in Fe3O4 (magnetite)8,9 and other materials.6,10,11 Stoichiometric Fe2CrO4 exhibits a spinel crystal
structure with equal concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+, resulting in an average Fe valence of 2.5.3,4 Cr was previously observed to exclusively occupy octahedral sites
in Fe2CrO4,3 in agreement
with the very large stabilization energy for Cr3+ in octahedral
coordination.12 Fe occupies all of the
tetrahedral and remaining octahedral sites of the spinel structure.3 Over-oxidation of Fe2CrO4 to Fe2CrO4+δ is accommodated by continuous
cation vacancy formation until 100% of Fe is converted to Fe3+ (δ = 0.5) and forms a cation-deficient spinel phase analogous
to γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite).13 Smooth, monotonic changes in the lattice parameter are
expected with increasing oxidation in the spinel phase.8,13,14 A corundum phase analogous to
α-Fe2O3 (hematite) can also form at higher
oxidation temperatures.15,16

The over-oxidation
process in Fe2CrO4+δ is expected to terminate
when all Fe cations have a valence of 3+
(δ = 0.5, Fe2CrO4.5). Fe4+ (or
Fe3+L, where L is a ligand hole) is typically only found
in lattices containing a stable 2+ cation such as Sr2+17−20 or Ni2+.21,22 When exposed to conditions known
to form Fe4+ in Sr2+- and Ni2+-containing
materials, Fe4+ is not found in materials lacking a 2+
cation.5,23 The average Fe valence in Fe2CrO4 does not appear to drop below +2.5 upon reduction,
indicating that oxygen vacancies (VO)
do not readily form in Fe2CrO4, limiting the
average oxidation range from Fe3+ to Fe2.5+ (δ
= 0.5 to δ = 0, Fe2CrO4.5 to Fe2CrO4).13

The oxidation
states of the cations are extremely important properties
and optical absorption characteristics are a powerful way to determine
them. It is possible to quantify the average Fe oxidation state in
Fe2CrO4+δ using the static imaginary part
(dielectric function [ε2], extinction coefficient
[k], or absorption coefficient [α]) of its
optical constants.5,7,24 X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is commonly used to estimate oxidation
states, but this can be a daunting task for ferrites (due to multiplet
splitting of the Fe 2p peak) and only probes the top ∼5 nm
of the material. In magnetite, the Verwey transition temperature is
routinely used to estimate the oxidation state, but this process is
rather qualitative and can be influenced by factors other than oxidation
state changes.25,26 Lattice parameters can be useful
to estimate the oxidation state for many materials, but a strong dependence
on the strain state and/or defect concentration can make comparisons
between different samples difficult or impossible. The optical properties
of ferrites provide a quantitative method for determining the average
oxidation state throughout the entire film for thicknesses in excess
of 5 nm. Differences in strain and defect concentrations are generally
found to result in minor changes in a material’s optical properties
relative to the large changes induced by variations in cation valence.6,27

A detailed analysis of the optical properties as a function
of
changing oxidation state has not previously been presented for Fe2CrO4+δ. Many of the optical transitions in
materials related to Fe2CrO4+δ (and other
transition-metal compounds) are dependent on the relative amounts
of Fe3+ and Fe2+ (and other transition-metal
oxidation states) in the lattice.28−33 Therefore, significant changes in the optical spectra are expected
when changing the oxidation state(s) in Fe2CrO4+δ. Here, we compare the structural and optical properties of epitaxial
films of Fe2CrO4+δ on MgAl2O4(001) as a function of the extent of over-oxidation
and synthesis conditions. This research will shed light on the relationships
between the oxidation state(s), atomic structure, and optical properties
in Fe2CrO4+δ. Potential improvements in
synthesis parthways and the utility of Fe2CrO4+δ will also be discussed.

Experimental Section
Fe2CrO4 films of thickness 120 to 400 Å
were deposited on 10 mm × 10 mm × 0.5 mm, (001)-oriented,
MgAl2O4 (MAO) substrates (CrysTec GmbH) via
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) as described elsewhere.4 In order to determine the influence of growth temperature
on the oxidation processes and resulting properties, we focus in this
study on two of the previously studied samples,4 one film is deposited at 250 °C and another at 600
°C. These films were previously determined to be stoichiometric
within the uncertainty of XPS.4 We subjected
the samples to the annealing conditions outlined in Table 1. This set of anneals was designed
to sequentially over-oxidize and reduce MBE-grown films in a controlled
way in order to systematically investigate reversible oxidation/reduction
in Fe2CrO4+δ films.

Red = anneals that
are expected to produce a lower oxidation state than the previous
condition. ox = anneals that are expected to produce a higher oxidation
state than the previous condition. MBE, vac = vacuum annealing (P ≤ 1 × 10–8 Torr) in the
MBE chamber. MBE, plasma = annealing in a beam of activated oxygen
from an electron cyclotron plasma oxygen source in the MBE chamber
at P = ∼4 × 10–5 Torr.
TF, air = annealing in a tube furnace in air at ambient pressure.
TF, O2 = annealing in a tube furnace with flowing pure
O2 at 1 atm. (flow rate = 0.2 L/min). UV/O3 =
exposure to simultaneous ozone and UV light in a Jelight UV/ozone
cleaner. HP = annealing on a hot plate in air with the sample placed
on clean Si wafer and an inverted alumina crucible placed over the
sample as a protective lid. The large and small c lattice parameter
values come from the split (004) Bragg reflections. The small (large) c values are determined from the large (small) Bragg angles.
SE = spectroscopic ellipsometry. XPS = X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

In situ XPS was carried out
on as-deposited and vacuum annealed
films. Ex situ XPS data were also collected after annealing samples
outside of the UHV system. Samples for ex situ analysis were cleaned
for 5 min in a Jelight ultraviolet/ozone cleaner, which removes most
of the carbon contamination, before reintroduction into the vacuum
system. Carbon contamination was found only after reintroducing cleaned
samples into the XPS/MBE system (e.g., after anneal ox-6, as shown
in Table 1). Carbon
was undetectable after anneal ox-7, which was carried out in the MBE
chamber.

XPS was performed using a VG/Scienta R3000 analyzer
with monochromatic
Al Kα X-rays. All spectra were shifted to align the O 1s peak
to 531.0 eV, except the Fe and Cr 2p spectra, as shown Figure 1a–c, measured after
deposition, and after the first in situ annealing at 250 °C.
For these spectra, an electron flood gun was required to neutralize
the charging effects. The spectral dispersion of the analyzer is slightly
different when the flood gun is on compared to when it is off. For
this reason, the Fe and Cr 2p spectra, as shown in Figure 1a–c, for the sample
deposited at 250 °C in the as-grown condition, and after anneal
red-1 (see Table 1),
were shifted to align the Fe 2p3/2 peak with that measured
after anneal red-10, as shown in Table 1.

Film thickness and roughness were determined by X-ray reflectivity
(XRR). Out-of-plane (OOP) c-axis lattice parameters
were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and are listed in Table 1. All XRD and XRR
data were collected using the same instrumentation (PANalytical X’Pert
Materials Research Diffractometer) described previously,4 except for the annealed sample deposited at 600
°C. Data from this sample were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab
diffractometer with a rotating Cu anode operated at 45 kV and 200
mA. The incident beam (Cu Kα) was filtered using a two-bounce
Ge(220) monochromator. OOP θ–2θ scans employed
a matching monochromator for the diffracted beam. Reciprocal space
maps were converted to direct space maps (DSMs) for convenience and
were recorded without an analyzer monochromator and utilizing a HyPix
3000 detector operating in line-detection mode.

Optical properties
were measured within the spectral range of 0.5–4.6
eV using spectroscopic ellipsometry (J.A. Woollam V-VASE). Data were
collected using at least three incident angles spanning 40–75°.
Ellipsometry fits were obtained by determining the refractive index
(n) and extinction coefficient (k) of the modeled layer that best reproduced the ellipsometry data,
using a model consisting of the layer thickness and roughness from
XRR as inputs. An exception was made for the model generated from
the as-grown film deposited at 250 °C. For this sample, XRR yielded
a surface roughness of ∼2.5 nm which led to a model generating
unrealistically sharp features in the UV region after fitting. The
roughness measured after anneal ox-11 (Table 1) was 1 nm. This value was used in the model
for the as-grown 250 °C film and yielded reasonable line shapes.
Relatively small changes occur in the resulting spectra by further
reducing the roughness to 0 nm. Others have shown that XRR yields
greater values for roughness compared to atomic force microscopy and
ellipsometry.34,35 Roughness can also be caused
by surface adsorbates,36 which can have
significantly different optical properties and densities compared
to the underlying film. The effect of these adsorbates on XRR and
ellipsometry measurements may not be comparable. Additionally, if
XRR and ellipsometry were conducted with a significant amount of time
between them, the absorbate layer coverage and thickness can be different
from one sample to another. Additional details of the film synthesis,
XPS, XRD, XRR, and ellipsometry data collection and analysis, can
be found elsewhere.4

Lift-outs for
cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) were prepared for both samples. The data for the film deposited
at 600 °C were previously presented, and the preparation and
imaging methods are reported elsewhere.4 STEM samples from the film deposited at 250 °C were prepared
using a standard lift out process on a FEI Helios DualBeam 660 focused
ion beam microscope, with initial cuts performed at 30 kV and final
thinning at 2 kV ion milling energy. Imaging was performed on a probe-corrected
JEOL GrandARM-300F microscope operating at 300 kV, with a convergence
semi-angle of 29.7 mrad and an inner collection angle of 75 mrad.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDS) maps were collected
using a dual JEOL Centurio detector setup (∼1.6 sr solid angle),
with a 1 Å probe size, ∼237 pA probe current, and 10 μs
px–1 dwell time.

Results
Chemical and
Structural Analysis
Figure 1a–f shows XPS spectra at different
stages of annealing. The Fe 2p spectra (Figure 1a,b) have been used as qualitative indicators
of the Fe valence.37 The satellite features
from Fe2+ and Fe3+ between the main Fe 2p3/2 (∼711 eV, as shown in Figure 1) and Fe 2p1/2 (∼725 eV,
as shown in Figure 1) spin–orbit features are of similar intensity in Fe3O4.38 This leads to a filling
of the valley between the main Fe 2p spin–orbit features. The
main Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 features shift slightly
to higher binding energies with increased over-oxidation. Figure 1b shows the low binding
energy shoulder in the Fe 2p3/2 feature highlighted by
vertical arrows. This shoulder becomes less pronounced after oxidizing
anneals and is well known to originate from Fe2+.39 However, strong overlap between the features
associated with Fe3+ and Fe2+ makes it difficult
to quantify the relative amounts of the two Fe valences using the
Fe 2p spectrum.9

Figure 1c shows high-resolution Cr
2p spectra. The line shapes and binding energies are largely consistent
with Cr3+. However, characteristic peaks appear at ∼580.5
and ∼590 eV after annealing in O plasma (anneals ox-7 and ox-11
in Table 1). This behavior
has previously been tentatively attributed to the presence of a double
surface chromyl (Cr=O) termination after exposure to the O
plasma.40 The peaks at ∼580.5 and
∼590 eV shrink after reducing anneals. The multiplet splitting
of Cr 2p3/2 has been previously shown in Fe2CrO4 and is consistent with that measured for α-Cr2O3.3

A decrease
of the Cr 2p peak area was observed after relatively
oxidizing anneals, as seen in Figures 1d and S7. This behavior
was previously reported in bulk polycrystalline samples of several
ferrites, including Fe2CrO4 and FeCr2O4, and is consistent with the formation of cation vacancies
and Fe segregation to the surface during oxidation.41 The preferential segregation of Fe to the surface during
oxidation was related to the differences in Fe and Cr diffusivity
at temperatures below ∼600 °C, driven by the relative
oxidation potentials of Fe2+ and Cr3+.42 The estimated relative surface compositions
after annealing range from Fe2.15Cr0.85O4+δ to Fe1.86Cr1.14O4+δ, and are estimated to be precise within ∼±3%. However,
these values are only within an error of ∼±10% of the
absolute composition.42

The VB spectra,
as shown in Figure 1e,f, provide additional insights into the over-oxidation
process. The entire spectrum shifts to slightly higher binding energy
with increased over-oxidation, consistent with the Fermi level moving
away from the VB. At the same time, the Fe2+ peak at ∼1.5
eV binding energy becomes weaker with increasing over-oxidation, as
expected.39 Based on the absence of the
Fe2+ VB feature, anneal ox-11 results in the greatest extent
of over-oxidation according to XPS. Judging from the fact that the
intensity at ∼1.5 eV after reducing anneals is not as large
as that in the as-grown case, the most reducing anneal (anneal red-10
in Table 1) did not
restore Fe2CrO4 to its as-grown state. Thus,
removing all excess oxygen from Fe2CrO4+δ is difficult under the conditions we explored. This result is consistent
with previous reports that did not detect oxygen vacancies in Fe2CrO4 after reducing anneals.13 The O 1s spectra for the film deposited at 250 °C
after the various anneals are shown in Figure S1. The only significant change results from surface hydroxyl
contaminants43 after reintroduction from
ambient into the XPS chamber. However, this species desorbs after
anneal ox-7.

The OOP XRD patterns for the 250 °C film as-deposited
and
after anneal ox-12 are displayed in Figure 2a. Figure 2b shows the XRD OOP diffraction pattern in the as-grown
state for the film deposited at 600 °C, and after annealing in
air at 250 °C for 2.5 h. The OOP XRD scan from 15 to 85°
(2θ) can be found in Figure S2, and
shows no additional peaks other than {001}-related features from the
substrate and film. The splitting of the film (004) Bragg peak, which
is attributed to Cr and Fe segregation,4 is present in the as-grown state and after all anneals in both samples.
An increase in the (004) Bragg peak splitting relative to that of
the as-grown material is observed in Figure 2b. This change after annealing the 600 °C
film in air at 250 °C for 2.5 h (condition 1 for the 600 °C
film in Table 1). This
result indicates that annealing at 250 °C leads to increased
Cr/Fe segregation, in agreement with previous reports.41 The OOP Bragg peak splitting for the film deposited
at 250 °C remains nearly constant, even after annealing at 400
°C (anneal ox-12 in Table 1). Interestingly, the oxidation power of anneal ox-11 which
was done using the O plasma source in the MBE, is weaker than that
of anneal ox-12, carried out at ambient pressure in an O2 tube furnace, as determined by the smaller lattice parameter achieved
after the latter. According to XPS, the film after anneals ox-12 and
ox-11 appears to be fully oxidized and the spectra are similar to
those of hematite26,44 The discrepancy between XPS,
which indicates complete oxidation after anneal ox-11, and XRD, which
indicates incomplete oxidation, is related to the different probe
depths of these techniques (∼5 nm for XPS vs the entire film
depth for XRD). Annealing in O plasma (ox-11) appears to fully oxidize
the near-surface region, but not the entire film, whereas the tube
furnace anneal (ox-12) is sufficient to fully oxidize the entire film.

films grown at (a) 250 and (b) 600 °C in the as-grown,

space map (DSM) for an as-grown film deposited at 600 °C. (d)
DSM for the film deposited at 600 °C after annealing for 2.5
h in air at 250 °C (ox-1). The crosses represent the expected
pseudomorphic and relaxed lattice parameters for stoichiometric Fe2CrO4.4

By comparing the dxy parameters for the film and substrate, partial strain is observed
in the film deposited at 600 °C, as shown in Figure 2c. Annealing has little effect
on the strain, as shown by the invariant dxy values before (Figure 2c) and after annealing (Figure 2d). A clear shift to smaller dz is observed with increasing
over-oxidation, in agreement with the OOP scans, as shown in Figure 2a,b, and previous
reports on bulk lattice parameters.13 The
physical cause is a decrease in the Fe–O bond length resulting
from the increased Coulomb attraction associated with increased Fe
valence.

Optical Properties
The optical properties of the film
deposited at 250 °C before and after a series of anneals are
shown in Figure 3a,b. Figure 4a,b shows the optical
properties of the film deposited at 600 °C before and after annealing,
along with reference spectra from Fe3O4 and
FeCr2O4 epitaxial films deposited on (001) MAO.
Cr substitution for Fe leads to systematic changes, as evidenced by
comparing spectra for FeCr2O4, Fe2CrO4, and Fe3O4, seen in Figure 4. More pronounced
transitions and higher extinction coefficients in the visible region
are observed with increasing over-oxidation.

(n) and extinction coefficient
(k) for epitaxial Fe2CrO4 in
the as-grown state and after several anneals for a film deposited
at 250 °C. (b) Magnified extinction coefficient (k) in the lower photon energy range. The numbers correspond to the
annealing conditions in Table 1.

Figure 4 (a) Refractive index (n) and
extinction coefficient
(k) before and after oxidation for a film deposited
at 600 °C. Films of Fe3O4 and FeCr2O4 on (001) MAO are also included. (b) Magnified
extinction coefficient (k) in the lower photon energy
range. The anneal (ox-1) of the film deposited at 600 °C was
over-oxidizing relative to the as-grown state.

The extinction coefficient near 0.9 eV (T9) becomes smaller and
eventually undetectable with increasing over-oxidation, as seen in Figure 3. An absorption peak
near 0.6 eV (T6) is absent from all spectra collected from the film
deposited at 250 °C (Figure 3) but is present for the film deposited at 600 °C.
The optical constants for the film deposited at 600 °C show a
slightly faster decrease in T6 compared to T9 with increasing over-oxidation,
as shown in Figure 4. T9 and T6 are directly correlated with the intensity of the Fe2+ VB peak, as shown in Figure 1e. Comparing Figures 3 and 4, some broad absorption
between 0.9 and 1.4 eV is found in FeCr2O445 that is not observed in the most over-oxidized
Fe2CrO4+δ sample deposited at 250 °C
after anneal ox-12.

In Figure 3b, an
absorption peak near 1.7 eV (T17) is readily observed in the most
oxidized (anneal ox-12, Table 1) Fe2CrO4+δ spectrum for the film
deposited at 250 °C. T17 is present in all spectra except that
of Fe3O4 but becomes somewhat obscured in samples
with a relatively reduced average Fe valence. T17 is slightly more
visible for the as-grown film deposited at 600 °C compared to
the film deposited at 250 °C, as seen by comparing the as-grown
spectra, as shown in Figures 3b and 4b. This is consistent with improved
structural quality in the 600 °C film resulting in less broadening.
T17 has a similar extinction coefficient (k ≈
0.08) in FeCr2O4 (Figure 4) and in the most oxidized Fe2CrO4+δ spectrum (anneal ox-12), as shown in Figure 3.

The absorption
edge associated with the peak near 2.5 eV (T25)
systematically becomes steeper and shifts to higher energy with increased
over-oxidation, as observed in Figures 3 and 4. However, the magnitude
of the extinction coefficient of T25 is largely invariant with changes
in the extent of over-oxidation of Fe2CrO4+δ. T25 is stronger in Fe2CrO4+δ than in
FeCr2O4, and weaker than in Fe3O4 (Figure 4).
Increased spectral weight is observed above 2.5 eV as the material
is oxidized. The highest transition edge captured, near 3.5–4
eV, redshifts with increasing over-oxidation. Evidence of a higher-lying
transition becomes visible in the over-oxidized samples. Difference
optical spectra for the most oxidized minus the most reduced (as-grown)
samples are shown in the Figures S3 and S4, along with the difference spectra for magnetite minus chromite.

Discussion
Our overall data set can be integrated to yield
insights into these
redox processes in the following way. We start by plotting the magnitude
of the extinction coefficient at T9 as a function of the OOP lattice
parameter, as shown in Figure 5a. The OOP lattice parameter is a good quantitative indicator
of the extent of over-oxidation for a given film, if the lattice parameter
of at least one end-member (stoichiometric Fe2CrO4 with Fe2.5+, fully oxidized Fe2CrO4.5 with Fe3+, or both) is known. However, different behaviors
are observed with over-oxidation for films with different initial
lattice parameters, which precludes using the OOP lattice parameter
as a universal measure of the extent of oxidation. The differences
in lattice parameter behavior are related to the growth conditions,
atomic structure, defect concentration, epitaxial strain, and cation
oxidation state (δ) of the film. This result is manifested by
the dissimilar slopes of the two lines, as shown in Figure 5a, which is related to the
different strain states and/or different atomic structures obtained
at different deposition temperatures for Fe2CrO4 films on (001) MAO.4 The relative strain
states in these two samples possibly differ, but this cannot be verified
directly because of the lack of a DSM feature for the 250 °C
film.4 Based on the differences in optical
properties, namely, the presence of the T6 absorption feature for
the 600 °C film only, we suspect a difference in the atomic structure
may also contribute to different lattice parameters at different synthesis
temperatures.

lattice parameter for Fe2CrO4+δ films
deposited at 250 and 600 °C after various anneals (see Table 1). The linear fits
assume that the lattice parameter for a given film is a linear function
of the degree of oxidation. (b) Average Fe valence of Fe2CrO4 films deposited at 250 and 600 °C as a function
of the magnitude of the extinction coefficient (k) at peak T9. A linear regression of the data points is shown as
a dotted line.

Making the assumption that the
as-grown samples contain stoichiometric
Fe2.5+ (this was previously confirmed for the 600 °C
film4 by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy,
XANES), and “250 °C ox-12” is fully oxidized (Fe3+), the Fe valence of the intermediate points (250 °C
ox-11 and 600 °C ox-1) can be estimated assuming a linear relationship
between the Fe valence and lattice parameter for each data set.6,7 In Figure 5b, these
Fe valences are plotted as a function of the magnitude of the extinction
coefficient at T9. Despite the differences in the lattice parameter,
these points lie nearly on a single line when correlated with the
extinction coefficient at T9. A linear regression produces a best-fit
line of the form [Fe valence] = 1.66([T9]) + 3.00, where [Fe valence]
is the average Fe valence in Fe2CrO4, and [T9]
is the magnitude of the extinction coefficient at T9 (∼0.9
eV). Using this relationship to quantitatively estimate δ in
Fe2CrO4+δ does not require prior knowledge
of the OOP lattice parameter or sample thermal history. As a further
advantage, the extinction coefficient can be measured with nondestructive
optical techniques that are readily available in many laboratories,
unlike other quantitative measures of valence such as XANES.

The difference in the as-grown lattice parameter and slope of the
fit lines, as shown in Figure 5a, can be used to indirectly indicate strain. Yearian et al.13 have previously measured bulk lattice parameters
for stoichiometric and over-oxidized Fe2CrO4+δ. The stoichiometric material value is ∼8.40 Å and the
over-oxidized material yields ∼8.37 Å, resulting in a
difference of ∼0.03 Å. Based on estimates of the Poisson’s
ratio (∼0.28 for magnetite46 and
∼0.3 for maghemite47 and realizing
that Cr has a minor effect as outlined in our previous work4), the OOP c-axis lattice parameter
for a pseudomorphic, stoichiometric Fe2CrO4(001)
film would be ∼8.66 Å under biaxial compression from an
(001) oriented MAO substrate. The analogous pseudomorphic lattice
parameter of the over-oxidized Fe2CrO4+δ (001) film would be ∼8.60 Å leading to a difference
of 0.06 Å. This difference in the c-axis lattice
parameter is twice as large for the strained system than the bulk
(relaxed) system. Therefore, we conclude that the film deposited at
250 °C is more relaxed than the film deposited at 600 °C,
based on the weaker dependence of the OOP lattice parameter on the
extent of over-oxidation, as shown in Figure 5. This is a very useful result because we
previously found that Fe2CrO4 films deposited
≤250 °C on MAO do not exhibit a (115) DSM Bragg peak,
precluding direct analysis of the strain state of the film.4

The extent of oxidation in the over-oxidized
sample was not determined
in Yearian, et al.13 However, the net change
in oxidation is irrelevant for the strain analysis in the previous
paragraph. We are only comparing qualitative changes in the lattice
parameter with relative changes in oxidation, which helps to determine
the strain state.

As with the XRD data, the Fe valence differs
slightly between estimates
generated using T9 absorption and estimates using XPS. This can be
observed by comparing the data in Table 1 with Figures 1–4 after anneal ox-11.
Minimal Fe2+ character is observed in the Fe 2p and VB
spectra after oxygen plasma anneals ox-7 and ox-11, as shown in Figure 2. However, the T9
absorption still exhibits signatures of Fe2+ after anneal
ox-11 (T9 absorption is not minimized). As with the XRD results, the
discrepancy between XPS and ellipsometry is due to the different probe
depths for the two techniques. Ellipsometry probes the entire ∼40
nm film. Using XPS, ∼85% of the signal is obtained from the
top ∼4.6 nm (∼5.5 unit cells) of the material.48 Therefore, analysis of oxidation extent via
XPS is only representative of the entire film for films under ∼5
nm thick.

In Fe2CrO4, the relatively narrow
energy
width of T6 is consistent with a tetrahedral Fe2+ single-ion
d–d crystal field absorption process as previously determined
for FeCr2O428,45,49 and similar materials with tetrahedral Fe2+.28,29 T6 is present only in Fe2CrO4+δ films deposited at ≥400 °C,4 independent of the average Fe valence, as shown
in Figures 3 and 4. T6 scales with oxidation, analogous to T9, which
indicates that T6 and T9 both involve transitions from the Fe2+ VB feature, as shown in Figure 1e,f.

It was previously shown that T6
increases with increasing OOP lattice.4 T6 appears only in Fe2CrO4+δ films that
approach the pseudomorphic strain state at growth temperatures
≥400 °C. The strain behavior of the optical properties
was previously compared for Fe2CrO4 films deposited
at ∼250 °C on MgO and MAO.4 Neither film exhibited T6, but both films were deposited at a temperature
at which T6 did not develop when depositing on MAO.4 The absence of T6 in spectra for films deposited at ≤250
°C, independent of strain, suggests that these films do not contain
Fe2+ at tetrahedral sites. This observation suggests that
the degree of inversion is influenced by the substrate temperature
during deposition, favoring inverse spinel at lower temperatures.
However, previous studies found Fe2+ at the tetrahedral
sites in films deposited on MgO under similar conditions.3 This result highlights the effect that subtle
differences in synthesis conditions, such as deposition temperature,
can have on the degree of spinel inversion (normal vs inverse) in Fe2CrO4. The
relationship between synthesis conditions and degree of inversion
has not been widely studied in the iron spinels, and our results suggest
that Fe2CrO4 thin films may serve as an interesting
model system for future studies.

Fe2+ nominally occupies
octahedral sites in Fe0.93O and Fe3O4. The single-ion Fe2+ crystal field transition in Fe0.93O50 and Fe3O451 is shifted to higher energies
near ∼0.9 eV compared to ∼0.6
eV for tetrahedral Fe2+ compounds like FeCr2O4. This is a result of the stronger crystal field surrounding
octahedral sites compared to tetrahedral sites.28,29,45,52,53 Fe3O4 exhibits a somewhat smaller
shift than Fe0.93O.50,51 This difference is
consistent with a mixture of inverse and normal spinel structures
in Fe3O4.54 The mixture
of Fe3+ and Fe2+ at tetrahedral and octahedral
sites leads to a mixture of the transitions associated with such cations,
resulting in broadened absorption features. Considering the significant
admixture between normal and inverse spinel structures in Fe2CrO4,3 we suspect that the
inverse-normal spinel mixture contributes significantly to the breadth
of T9.

The difference in the magnitude of the extinction coefficient
of
the crystal field single-ion Fe2+ transition at ∼0.9
eV between Fe0.93O and FeCr2O4 can
be explained by the approximately three times higher Fe2+ concentration in Fe0.93O compared to FeCr2O4. Fe3O4 has the same Fe2+concentration as FeCr2O4 and Fe2CrO4, so in principle Fe3O4 should
exhibit the same magnitude of extinction coefficient at 0.9 eV as
these oxides, but instead Fe3O4 has nearly the
same T9 absorption as Fe0.93O.50,51 This result has been interpreted as “intensification,”
which occurs when aliovalent Fe atoms exist at neighboring lattice
sites.28,30−32 According to this criteria,
the Fe2CrO4 films measured here could have absorption
contributions at ∼0.9 eV because of intensification.

Changing the degree of spinel inversion should alter the extinction
coefficient of a transition experiencing “intensification,”
by changing the concentration of aliovalent cations at neighboring
lattice sites. Based on their different lattice parameters and distinctly
different T6 behaviors, we suggest that the films discussed here show
evidence for different degrees of inversion. Thus, we expect to observe
a difference in the extinction coefficient between these films for
a transition exhibiting “intensification”. However,
the maximum extinction coefficient at 0.9 eV is ∼0.3 for all
deposition temperatures of Fe2CrO4, as displayed
in Figures 3 and 4 and shown in our previous research.4 The similarities in the T9 extinction coefficient, independent
of the degree of inversion, suggest that intensification does not
play a significant role at T9 in our films.

T9 absorption monotonically
decreases in Fe2CrO4+δ as δ increases,
indicating that T9 is related
to Fe2+. Considering that XPS shows complete oxidation
after anneal ox-11 and ellipsometry shows nearly complete oxidation
after anneal ox-11 (again with the discrepancy being related to different
probe depths), this monotonic decrease in the extinction coefficient
at ∼0.9 eV is approximately linear with the change in the Fe
valence. This linear behavior further suggests that intensification
is not significant in Fe2CrO4+δ and is
consistent with T9 being a single-ion crystal field transition from
the highest occupied octahedral Fe2+ 3d state to the lowest
unoccupied Fe 3d state.50,51Figure 4 shows slight absorption at 0.9 eV in FeCr2O4 (chromite), which can be explained by the overlapping
tails of T6 and T17, or by a slight excess of Fe in the film. T9 is
strongly enhanced in Fe3O4, as shown in Figure 4. Thus, we suggest
that T9 in Fe2CrO4+δ requires octahedral
Fe2+, which is formally absent from pure FeCr2O4.

While the oxidation dependence of the extinction
coefficient at
T9 for Fe2CrO4+δ is approximately linear
and suggestive of a single-ion process, the compositional dependence
of the extinction coefficient at T9 with decreasing Cr content from
FeCr2O4 to Fe3O4 is not
linear, indicating that “intensification” eventually
begins to play a role at some point within this phase space. T9 does
not have the exact same dependence on extent of over-oxidation as
does T6. Therefore, exchange coupled pairing or intervalence charge
transfer cannot be ruled out as a secondary process contributing to
T9 in Fe2CrO4+δ.29 Further discriminating between and describing these absorption processes
requires detailed local structural analysis, polarization-dependent
optical characterization, temperature-dependent measurements, and
magneto-optical experiments, which are beyond the scope of this paper.

Analyzing the changes in optical properties to estimate oxidation
extent is not unique to Fe2CrO4+δ. Other
Fe systems show similar behavior. Substituting Sr for La in La1−xSrxFeO3−δ6,7,19 yielded
comparable changes in optical properties to those observed here after
subjecting samples by reducing/oxidizing anneals.6 The same effect with chemical substitution is also expected
in Fe2CrO4+δ. For example, substituting
Mg2+ cations for Fe2+, leading to a larger fraction
of Fe3+, should produce an effect similar to that of oxidation.
We expect that this method can be extended to allow for cation valence
estimation in other Fe based and non-Fe-based oxide systems.

Considering that the XPS revealed a change in the Fe/Cr cation
ratio at the surface (Figures 1d and S7), we analyze the possibility
that segregated layering or cation grading affects the associated
optical properties. To this end, we introduced various surface layers
and gradients into our optical model. The results can be seen in Figure S6. None of these models significantly
modify the behavior of the extinction coefficient at low energy. Therefore,
assuming a single optical layer for the Fe2CrO4 film is a reasonable approximation.

We address the possible
difference in optical properties resulting
from a difference in cation segregation profiles within the bulk of
the film by analyzing cross-sectional STEM–EDS maps, as shown
in Figure S5. In Figure S5, we observe a similar microstructure for both films in the
as-grown state, indicating that there is no dependence of cation segregation
behavior on growth temperature, at least in the 250 to 600 °C
range. Previous reports have suggested cation homogenization at ≥600
°C;41 however, we previously detected
Mg (<1 atomic %) diffusion from the MgO substrate to the surface
of the film deposited at 600 °C. Attempts to deposit at a higher
temperature may result in less Fe and Cr cation segregation but will
also result in more Mg diffusion from the substrate into the film.
Based on the similar microstructures between the films deposited at
250 and 600 °C, the significant difference in optical properties
(namely the transition at 0.6 eV) is not a result of the relatively
small degree (∼10%) of chemical segregation observed, but likely
results from the different atomic structures (measured as a difference
in the OOP c-axis lattice parameter) that arise from
a different degree of spinel inversion induced by different synthesis
temperatures.

Material quality may be improved by modifying
the growth conditions
such that over-oxidized Fe2CrO4+δ (δ
= 0.5) is condensed during synthesis. Postgrowth annealing under reducing
environments can then be used to achieve the desired oxygen stoichiometry.
Fe2CrO4.5 has a smaller lattice parameter than
the O-stoichiometric phase, making the lattice match between the film
and MAO substrate more favorable. Oxygen-stoichiometric (δ =
0) Fe2CrO4+δ is also relatively complex,
containing Fe3+ and Fe2+ at tetrahedral and
octahedral sites.3 This allows for a large
possible variance in the degree of spinel inversion, which may account
for many of the unique observations in this system. Fe2CrO4.5 only contains +3 cations and does not allow for
any variance in the degree of spinel inversion, greatly simplifying
the lattice. Another benefit of eliminating +2 cation sites is that
Mg2+ diffusion may be suppressed, allowing for increased
growth temperatures without Mg contamination from the substrate and
potentially leading to improved crystallization and compositional
homogeneity.

General material properties can be deduced from
the obtained optical
spectra. The lack of absorption below ∼1.4 eV in over oxidized
Fe2CrO4+δ may improve the material as
a solar absorber relative to stoichiometric Fe2CrO4. Additionally, the absorption coefficient across the visible
and UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum is enhanced with increasing
δ in Fe2CrO4+δ.

Summary
The chemical, structural, and optical properties of Fe2CrO4+δ films grown on MgAl2O4(001) have been characterized as a function of extent of over-oxidation.
Several reversible trends are observed in XPS spectra, including the
modulation of an Fe2+-derived feature at the top of the
valence band near 1.5 eV, which drops as δ increases. The OOP
lattice parameter decreases with increasing δ in our films.
The relative trends in the OOP lattice parameter with oxidation suggest
that films deposited at 250 °C and below are more relaxed than
films deposited at temperatures ≥400 °C. The value of
the OOP lattice parameter is found to be a poor indicator of the oxidation
state between films with different thermal histories but is useful
in estimating the extent of over-oxidation for a given sample.

The average Fe valence, determined by δ in Fe2CrO4+δ, is inversely related to the magnitude of
the extinction coefficients at ∼0.6 eV (T6) and ∼0.9
eV (T9). As reported earlier, T6 is only observed in films deposited
at ≥400 °C,4 but is not induced
solely as a result of a difference in the oxidation state. T6 results
from a thermally induced structural change, most likely the occupation
of tetrahedral sites by Fe2+, which is apparently absent
from films deposited at ≤250 °C. This result highlights
the complex roles that synthesis temperature and oxidation state have
in activating electronic/optical processes in these materials. Thus,
extreme care must be taken to properly synthesize and analyze materials
and compare their properties, especially when considering films and
bulk materials, and samples with different thermal histories.

The intensities of T6 (where relevant) and T9 are directly related
to the highest energy VB feature near 1.5 eV, which is known to be
Fe2+-derived, and their magnitudes should trend closely
for films less than 5 nm thick. For thicker films, the level of over-oxidation
(δ) throughout the film thickness can easily be estimated from
the extinction coefficient at ∼0.9 and ∼0.6 eV (if applicable).
Changing microstructures as a result of annealing do not have a significant
influence on the optical properties compared to inducing changes in
Fe oxidation state.

The strain state of Fe2CrO4+δ can be
determined from the change in lattice parameter as a function of oxidation.
Strained films exhibit a faster change in lattice parameter with oxidation
compared to relaxed films. This is particularly useful for films deposited
at 250 °C and below, which do not exhibit diffraction from (115)
planes.

Fe2CrO4+δ exhibits minimal
absorption
below ∼1.2 eV when over oxidized. Fe2CrO4 may be useful for applications requiring a tunable infrared absorption
coefficient. Higher oxidation states may lead to potentially favorable
optical properties for solar energy conversion, marked by weaker IR,
and stronger UV/visible light absorption with increasing over-oxidation.
