We
report an excellent anisotropic Au nanoparticle-based colorimetric
probe for the detection of Hg2+ ions with higher detection
ability and selectivity. The manifestation of different morphologies
of Au nanoparticles including round, triangular, rectangular, pentagonal,
and hexagonal has been realized by the dimethylenebis-(tetra-decyldimethylammonium
bromide) (14-2-14 Gemini surfactant) assisted one-step thermal reduction
method where the average size of Au nanoparticles was 54.65 ±
44.3 nm. The growth and frequency of Au nanoparticles were enhanced
as a function of Gemini surfactant’s concentration. The detection
limit as low as 1.8 nM was efficaciously achieved and was considerably
lower than the required world standards defined the maximum allowable
level of Hg2+ ions for health hazards. Notably, the Au
nanoparticles showed visible detection for 100 μM Hg2+ ion by means of the change in the solution color from red to tarnish
blue within 180 s followed by saturation in the absorption ratio (ALSPR/ATSPR). These
results provide novel insight into the detection of the heavy metal
ion using Gemini surfactant-assisted grown anisotropic metal nanoparticles.
On the basis of obtained results, it is concluded that the size of
metal nanoparticles is no longer critical for preparation of efficient
selective chemoprobe; rather, growth of more number of edges provides
a large number of sights for incoming moieties and plays an important
role in improving the detection capability of the anisotropic metal
nanoparticle irrespective of their large sizes. We believe that this
work provides valuable insight into researchers working in the area
of chemosensor applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy
metal ions can cause severe threats to the environment and
human health, and the potential sources of substantial metal ions
are mining, agriculture, toxic wastes, electronic merchandise, and
natural discharge from earth’s crust into the surroundings.
This discharge from oceanic and volcanic emissions end up in the contamination
of underground water resources and human beings get exposed to the
same. Among aforesaid ions, mercury ions are incredibly fatal and
may cause serious health problems if consumed by individuals, leading
to numerous critical diseases such as harmful effects on immune systems,
cancer, organ damage, nervous system damage, etc.1,2 According
to the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. environmental protection
agency, the detection limit for Hg2+ are 30 and 10 nM,
respectively;3,4 therefore, it is essential to
achieve standards via reliable ways or procedures.

Nanomaterial-supported
colorimetric approaches have attracted excessive
attention due to their distinctive advantages such as ease of fabrication,
fast monitoring, and even detection with an eye.5 Normally, the fluorescence method,6 surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,7 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach,8 and conventional methods such as atomic absorption spectroscopy,9 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,10 and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography11 have widely been used for a precise qualitative
analysis. Among these, SPR analysis encompasses a candid sample preparation,
consistent and needs low-cost tools compared to aforesaid other techniques.
The SPR-based colorimetric analysis acknowledges detection of heavy
metal ions by a noticeable shift in SPR resulting via aggregation
of metal nanoparticles followed by a change in the solution color.

A variety of nanomaterials have been established to be effective
for mercury ion monitoring including noble metal nanoparticles (Au
and Ag), semiconductor nanocrystals, polymeric materials, biomaterials,
etc.12,13 Among them, metal nanoparticles are found
promising for selective detection of Hg2+ ions.14 The detection of heavy metal ions immensely
rely on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles and accessibility
of functionalized species on their surface, which either directly
interacts with heavy metal ions or reduces them to interact with metal
nanoparticles.15,16 Notably, metal nanoparticles
of sizes 5 to 15 nm have been found promising for the detection of
heavy metal ions; however, it requires a multistep process, usage
of harsh reducing agents, and vast quantitative control over chemical
reagents.

The anisotropic metal nanoparticles have received
considerable
attention attributed to the distinguished optical properties and adaptable
surface modification viability. The preferential growth of low-energy
facets provides active absorption sites for interfacial interaction
between the metal nanoparticle and heavy metal ions, thereby augmenting
sensitivity regardless of their large size (greater than 100 nm).17,18 Therefore, use of these nanostructures may be a choice to improve
the detection of heavy metal ions. Foremost, the seed growth method
is the well-established chemical route for synthesizing controllable
anisotropic nanoparticles.19 However, vigilant
processing entails higher quality seed solution with a uniform size
generally smaller than 5 nm. The method may involve multiple steps
depending upon the requirement of shape and size of particles at the
nanoscale. In addition, a higher quantity of conventional surfactants
required due to their higher critical micelle concentration (cmc).
Inevitably, an easy and reliable approach is required to overcome
abovementioned issues.

Gemini surfactant (GS) is a class of
surfactant with two hydrocarbon
tails and two polar head groups covalently joined by a spacer compare
to the single hydrocarbon tail and polar head group in conventional
surfactants. These features effectively enhance their absorption ability
at the liquid–solid interface even at low cmc.20 Moreover, the hydrocarbon chain length
considerably affects the size and shape of metal nanoparticles.21,22 According to our recent investigation,22−24 GSs of varied
hydrocarbon chain length and concentration significantly influenced
the shape and size of the nanomaterials and concluded that the GS
acts as a shape-directing agent; it helps to grow nanoparticles at
the nanoscale with highly unstable edge or corner regions, which is
indeed highly desirable for chemosensor applications. The enhancement
in the chain length of GS (m = 16, 18, and 20) resulted
in a shape transformation from triangular particles with truncated
corners to smooth round corners of anisotropic growth of Au nanoparticles.
The changes in the particle shape and size were found critical toward
detection of Hg2+. The large-sized triangular nanoparticles
prepared with a smaller chain length showed the best sensing ability,
whereas the detection capability dramatically lowers for Au nanoparticles
synthesized with a larger chain length.22 This clearly indicates that the reduction in the hydrocarbon chain
length can influence the sensing ability of metal nanoparticles by
means of controlling the growth and promoting the degree of anisotropy.

In order to confirm these, it is essential to investigate the influence
of the shorter hydrocarbon chain length on the detection performance
of metal nanoparticles. In view of that, we selected dimethylenebis-(tetra-decyldimethylammonium
bromide) (14–2-14) GS with a shorter hydrocarbon chain length
and further investigated sensitivity and selectivity of anisotropic
nanoparticles. The well-defined morphologies of Au nanoparticles were
prepared by the one-step approach and were able to detect Hg2+ as low as 1.8 nM with high selectivity, which is the best among
Au nanoparticle-based chemosensor probes prepared using GS of having
different hydrocarbon chain lengths.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 demonstrates
UV–visible absorption spectra of the Au nanoparticles synthesized
by varying the concentrations of (14-2-14) GS. All the spectra illustrate
the two surface plasmon resonances (SPR) confirming the formation
of Au nanoparticles irrespective of the change in GS concentrations.
The SPR absorbance appears because of the resonance between conduction
electrons and incident electromagnetic radiations. The transverse
surface plasmon resonance (TSPR) crests have been observed as a major
peak around 536–542 nm and a weak longitudinal surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) peak around 718–727 nm. The presence of two
SPR absorbance bands indicates that the nanoparticles have anisotropic
morphology. The trend clearly displays red-shift (in the case of TSPR
is ∼6 nm and in the case of LSPR is ∼9 nm) in a consistent
manner as the concentration of GS increased from 0.2 to 3 mM suggesting
that Au nanoparticle size increased as a function of surfactant concentration.
Notably, no LSPR is observed for Au nanoparticles synthesized without
(14-2-14) GS, and only a TSPR peak was observed at 530 nm, which generally
indicates the formation of monodispersed, round-shaped Au nanoparticles.
The corresponding UV spectrum of Au nanoparticles is not included
to avoid any redundancy. The appearance of red-shifts in the absorbance
of both TSPR and LSPR peaks suggests that the (14-2-14) GS serves
as a shape-regulating mediator for Au nanoparticles where the shapes
and sizes of Au nanoparticles are extremely reliant on the concentration
of the surfactant.

Figure 1 UV–vis absorption spectra of Au nanoparticles at
different
concentrations (0.2–3 mM) of (14-2-14) GS.

For further investigation of the impact of the (14-2-14) GS concentrations
on the shape and size of Au nanoparticles, the microstructural analysis
was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The three
concentrations, 0.2, 2, and 3 mM, were selected as they have shown
a maximum shift in both TSPR and LSPR. Figure 2a–c shows transmission electron micrographs
of Au nanoparticles synthesized at 0.2 mM (14-2-14) GS. The same figures
divulged that diverse-shaped Au nanoparticles including ground, triangular,
rectangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal were prepared, and among all
of them, the number of round shapes was more than the other shapes.
The number of Au nanoparticles of different morphologies is summarized
in Figure 2d. Figure 2e,f demonstrates
high-resolution TEM images of Au nanoparticles of hexagonal shape
where the surface of the nanoparticle was covered by a very thin layer
of thickness ∼1.1 nm, which may be a mixture of (14-2-14) GS
and sodium citrate discussed in detail in the text at the later stage.

Figure 3a–d
displays TEM images of Au nanoparticles synthesized with 2 mM concentration
of (14-2-14) GS. Evidently, the numbers of differently shaped nanoparticles
are enhanced at the higher concentration of (14-2-14) GS except for
round- and hexagonal-shaped nanoparticles. The particle distribution
in relation to their shape is compiled in Figure 3e. The numbers of triangular, pentagonal,
and rectangular nanoparticles increased by 12, 11, and 2%, respectively,
compared to the Au nanoparticles synthesized with 0.2 mM concentration
of the (14-2-14) GS, whereas the number of round- and hexagonal-shaped
nanoparticles was decreased by 21 and 4%, respectively. It suggests
that the GS significantly promotes the anisotropic growth of Au nanoparticles
while consuming round- and hexagonal-shaped nanoparticles. Indeed,
the change in the number of nanoparticles in relation to the concentration
of (14-2-14) GS indicates that the growth of nanoparticles occurs
on the expense of round-shaped nanoparticles where the geometrical
axis of the nanoparticle is eaten up during the growth process in
sequence from round- to hexagonal- to pentagonal- to triangular-shaped
nanoparticles. For better understanding, the high-resolution TEM image
having different-shaped nanoparticles is shown in Figure 3f–h. The HRTEM image
in Figure 3g taken
from Figure 3f shows
a Au nanoparticle attained an intermediate geometrical transformation
state during the growth process where the shape and size of the nanoparticle
are changing from one shape to the other. Here, the shape of these
Au nanoparticles is referred as round. It is also supported by the
fact that the number of pentagonal and triangular nanoparticles is
increased remarkably in relation to the decrease in number of round-
and hexagonal-shaped nanoparticles. Figure 3 h showing a high-resolution TEM image evidently
confirmed that the particle has a fine pentagonal shape, and their
surface was covered by the thin layer of thickness ∼1.2 nm,
which is a very much comparable thickness present on the surface of
Au nanoparticles synthesized using 0.2 mM surfactant. Figure 3i shows the EDX elemental analysis
specifying the manifestation of the presence of only gold. Here, an
extra peak for Cu appears from the copper grid used for the analysis.

image of Au nanoparticles. (g) High-magnification image of a single
particle capped with a surfactant layer of thickness ∼1.2 nm
and (h) EDX spectrum of Au nanoparticles at 2 mM (14-2-14) GS.

Figure 4a–e
shows TEM images of Au nanoparticles synthesized with 3 mM concentration
of (14-2-14) GS. As is clear, no significant change in numbers of
differently shaped nanoparticles was observed at the higher concentration
of (14-2-14) GS. The particle distribution in relation to their shape
is compiled in Figure 4f. The number of round-shaped nanoparticles increases significantly,
and other shapes including hexagonal, pentagonal, and tetragonal are
nearly similar or decreased significantly compare to 2 mM (14-2-14)
GS. This clearly indicated that the higher concentration of GS hinders
the growth of Au nanoparticles and hence suppressing the longitudinal
surface plasmon resonance. For better understanding, the changes in
particle number distribution in relation to GS concentration are summarized
in Figure 5.

0.2, 2, and 3 mM.

Along with the Au nanoparticle
shapes, the size was also influenced
by the surfactant concentration. Figure S1a–c shows the bar graph of the particle size distribution of Au nanoparticles.
The average size of Au nanoparticles was increased from 41.54 ±
32.0 nm to 54.65 ± 34.3 nm and further decrease to 35.97 ±
25.30 nm as the concentration of GS increased. For a vibrant insight,
the average sizes of nanoparticles with various shapes are outlined
in Table 1. The round-shaped
nanoparticles are almost similar in size, while the size of other
shapes is higher for 2 mM GS concentration compare to the other concentration
of the surfactant. The change in the particle number and size of Au
nanoparticles suggests that the (14-2-14) GS not only influences the
growth of metal nanoparticles but also acts as a shape-directing agent.

In an attempt to enumerate the surface adsorption of the surfactant
on the Au surface, Figure S2 illustrates
comparative FTIR spectral studies of pure (14-2-14) GS and Au nanoparticles
synthesized in the presence of (14-2-14) GS with the same concentration
of the surfactant. The FTIR of pure sodium citrate is also included
for the sake of comparison. Also, the peak assignments in relation
to the (14-2-14) GS are summarized in Table S1. The FTIR result endorses the presence of GS on Au nanoparticles
and supports the results obtained by TEM analysis.26−32

Further, Au nanoparticles prepared with the 2 mM concentration
of (14-2-14) GS were used as a colorimetric assay for the detection
of Hg2+ ions as it consists of more number of diverse-shaped
Au nanoparticles. The stable Au nanoparticle dispersion exhibits electrostatic
repulsion between nanoparticles and maintains stability via restricting
aggregation, thereby suggesting its viability for obtaining superior
sensing. In order to obtain improved sensitivity and detection limit
of the colorimetric assay, the salinity conditions (NaCl and pH) were
optimized because it overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between
Au nanoparticles and offers low barrier for the metal ion-induced
nanoparticle aggregation. The freshly prepared different concentrations
(0.10–200 μM) of Hg2+ ions were mixed with
the aforementioned colorimetric assay and allowed to equilibrate for
5 min. Subsequently, the prepared solutions were transferred into
a quartz cuvette for recording UV–visible spectral data. Figure 6a shows the UV–vis
spectra of Au nanoparticles with different Hg2+ ion concentrations.
The Au nanoparticles gradually aggregated with an increase in Hg2+ concentration. Accordingly, UV–visible spectra of
Au nanoparticles also show a noticeable TSPR shift from 542 to 572
nm shown in Figure 6b, whereas an upward shift in LSPR was also observed, which suggests
that the change in the average size is due to the agglomeration of
Au nanoparticles. In order to investigate it, the TEM analysis of
Au nanoparticles collected after detection of Hg2+ was
performed, as shown in Figure S3. As is
clear, the Au nanoparticles were agglomerated after the addition of
Hg2+, and no change in morphology of anisotropic Au nanoparticles
occurred after detection of Hg2+. The gradual change in
the Au nanoparticle solution color from red to tarnish blue by the
addition of Hg2+ is shown in Figure 6c. The aggregation extent can be estimated
by taking the absorption ratio (ALSPR/ATSPR) of LSPR and TSPR peaks of Au nanoparticles,
respectively. The absorption ratio (ALSPR/ATSPR) of LSPR and TSPR peaks at A727 and A542 were
selected to estimate the extent of agglomeration, respectively. The
absorption ratio A727/A542 of the colorimetric assay was plotted in the range
from 0.1 to 200 μM, and the calibration curve was fitted to
the logistic plot with a regression coefficient of 0.9870 (Y = 0.7033–0.3721 (1 + exp(X –
0.117)/0.429), where Y is the absorption ratio, and X is the concentration of Hg2+. Additionally,
a linear relationship among the absorbance ratio and Hg2+ concentration commencing from 0 to 0.10 μM with R2 = 0.9842 (Y = 1.0866X + 0.414), is summarized in the inset of Figure 7. The limit of detection (LOD) for Hg2+ based on 3σ/S for Au nanoparticles
prepared with (14-2-14) GS at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was estimated
to be 1.8 nM, where σ stands for standard deviation, and S is
the slope. The LOD was much lower than the Hg2+ detection
limit set by WHO (30 nM) and the U.S. environmental protection agency
(10 nM).3,4 In addition, the obtained LOD is about ∼42
times higher than the Au nanoparticles prepared with GS of a larger
alkyl chain length.22 The limit of detection
reported in this work for Au nanoparticles synthesized with (14-2-14)
is 1.8 nM higher than the 107, 76, and 176 nM for (16-2-16), (18-2-18),
and (20-2-20) GS, respectively.22 This
clearly indicates that the selection of the chain length is critical
for obtaining superior sensing properties. However, detail investigation
is required to investigate the effect of the chain or spacer length
on the detection capability of metal nanoparticles.

The improved detection ability is due to the GS, which acts as
a soft template for the anisotropic growth of Au nanoparticles. The
surfactant adsorbs on the Au surface (at different crystallographic
faces) leading to the preferential growth of nanoparticles. The cationic
GS promotes growth of the {111} end facet of Au nanoparticles by preferential
adsorption at {100} and {110} side facets.26 The interaction between Hg2+ and Au nanoparticles only
occurs when mercury exist in the Hg0 state. Therefore,
conversion or reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0 state
is essential. Since the as-prepared nanoparticles are used for detection
of Hg2+, therefore, the citrate ions available on the surface
of Au can act as the reducing agent, reduce Hg2+ to Hg0 state, and allow interaction between Au–Hg, which
also known as amalgamation,27,28 confirmed by the SPR
change and transformation of the solution color from pink to tarnish
blue followed by aggregation of Au nanoparticles. Figure S4 schematically describes the interaction between
Hg2+ and Au nanoparticles. On the basis of obtained results,
it is concluded that the size of metal nanoparticles is no longer
critical for the preparation of an efficient selective chemoprobe;
rather, growth of more number of edges provides a large number of
sights for incoming moieties and plays an important role in improving
the detection capability of anisotropic metal nanoparticle irrespective
of their large sizes. The most unstable region (high-energy facets)
is contributive for the formation of more number of edges and corners,
which in turn is favorable for the growth of low-energy facets. These
low-energy facets provide a large number of active sites on the surface
of nanoparticles for interaction with the heavy metal ion.17,18,26

Further, the selectivity
of the as-prepared assay for Hg2+ has been compared to
other different metal ions, including Cu2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, K+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sn2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+ with a concentration of 1000 μM
for each. Deliberately, the concentration of Hg2+ was maintained
at 200 μM. The time-dependent absorption ratio of LSPR-to-TSPR
peaks (A727/A542) of Au nanoparticles in the absence and presence of different metal
ions is shown in Figure 8a, whereby a sharp change in the absorption ratio for Hg2+ transpired in a short interval of time in comparison to other metal
ions. In addition, the red Au nanoparticle solution was changed to
tarnish blue in the presence of Hg2+ ions, whereas no significant
change in the color was observed with the passage of time in other
cases. The Au nanoparticles showed a visible change in the solution
color from red to tarnish blue within 180 s for 100 μM Hg2+ ion followed by saturation in the absorption ratio (ALSPR/ATSPR). The
image of the corresponding solutions is shown in Figure 8b. It is of note that the concentration
of Hg2+ used for comparative analysis was about three orders
lower than the other metal ion concentrations, which reflects the
detection potential of Au nanoparticles synthesized using (14-2-14)
GS. In addition, the cross-selectivity of the assay prepared for Hg2+ ions in the solutions was further investigated by mixing
the Hg2+ ion already consisting of other different metal
ions. The solution color was changed from red to tarnish blue (Figure 8c) in a similar manner
as was observed in the case of Hg2+ ions, again confirming
the interaction of Hg2+ with Au nanoparticles irrespective
of the presence of other metal ions. In order to estimate the detection
ability of anisotropic Au nanoparticles in this work toward Hg2+, the limit of detection is compared with Au nanoparticles
of different morphologies shown in Table S2. As is clear, the LOD of anisotropic Au nanoparticles in this work
has higher sensitivity toward Hg2+ compare to the different
morphologies, which clearly reflects their potential.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the anisotropic
Au nanoparticles were synthesized
using (14-2-14) GS via the one-step thermal reduction method. The
Au nanoparticles consist of different morphologies including round,
triangular, rectangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal. The Au nanoparticle-based
colorimetric probe was efficient to detect Hg2+ ions with
higher detection ability and selectivity without any surface modification
of Au nanoparticles with the Hg2+ specific ligand. The
Au nanoparticles with well-defined morphologies displayed a detection
limit as low as 1.8 nM, much lower than the required world standards.
The results suggest that the anisotropic metal nanoparticles are significant
to detect heavy metal ions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) and
sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (C6H5O7Na3·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich)
have been used as precursor materials for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles.
The shape-directing agent, dimethylenebis-(tetra-decyldimethylammonium
bromide) (14-2-14), was prepared in keeping with the protocol reported
previously.25 The high quality of GS was
accomplished after a repetitive crystallization process by using a
mixture of ethyl acetate and acetone. Sodium acetate (C2H3NaO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), sodium chloride (NaCl), and all metal salts (HgCl2, CuCl2, CdCl2, FeCl2, KCl, MnCl2, NiCl2, Pb(C2H3O2), SnCl2, ZnCl2, and ZrCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich))
were used in sensing measurements. The glasswares were cleaned with
freshly prepared HCl/HNO3 (3:1, aqua regia), consequently
cleaned thoroughly with demineralized water and dehydrated in an oven
prior to usage.

4.2 Synthesis of Au Nanoparticles
The
Au nanoparticles of different morphologies were synthesized by reducing
a gold precursor with sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate in the presence
of the shape-directing agent (14-2-14). Typically, 50 mL of aqueous
solutions of HAuCl4·3H2O (0.25 mM) was
boiled at 110 °C. A freshly prepared aqueous sodium citrate (5.0
mL, 2.5 mM) containing (14-2-14) GS solution with a concentration
of 0.20–3 mM was added to the gold salt solution and kept under
vigorous stirring at 110 °C. Subsequently, the color of the solution
gradually changes from pale yellow to red within 30 s. The reaction
was allowed to proceed further for 30 min in order to harvest a stable
solution. The solution was then left untouched at room temperature
for 2 h.

4.3 Characterizations
The formation of
Au nanoparticles and performing colorimetric sensing measurements
have been characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy (Systronics
2202 spectrophotometer) in the spectral range of 450–900 nm.
The morphological characterization of Au nanoparticles for size and
shape distribution was executed using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, Philips CM-200). The histograms of the particle size and shape
distribution were collected from more than 100 particles. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), attached to the TEM equipment, have been
used to examine the chemical composition of Au nanoparticles. The
Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of synthesized Au
nanoparticle solutions was recorded by using an Agilent Cary 630 100
V FTIR instrument, operated in the range of 700–3000 cm–1. The FTIR spectral studies of Au nanoparticles were
carried out after washing four times with water using the centrifuge
process.

4.4 Chemosensor Probe for Detection of Hg2+ Ions
C2H3NaO2 buffer
solution (0.01 M) with a pH range from 1.5 to 11 by the addition of
0.1 M HCl and NaOH was prepared to check the stabilization condition
of aqueous Au nanoparticles. In addition, to accomplish detection
of very low concentrations of metal ions, the NaCl concentration was
optimized in aqueous Au nanoparticles, which reduces the electrostatic
repulsion between Au nanoparticles and provides a low barrier for
metal ion-induced nanoparticle aggregation. The synthesized Au nanoparticles
were stable in 0.75 M NaCl concentrations at pH = 4. The optimization
process is reported elsewhere.22 For detection
of Hg2+, 1500 μL of aliquots of as-prepared Au nanoparticles
were pretreated with 500 μL of NaCl. The prepared solution was
then added to aqueous Hg2+ (in the range from 0.1 to 200
μM), which was prepared in 0.01 M sodium acetate buffer solution
at pH 4.0. The resulting solution was left for several minutes at
room temperature in order to determine preliminary sensing measurement
through the naked eye before UV–vis analysis.
