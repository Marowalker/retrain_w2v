Luminescent downshifting
(LDS) materials are in great demand
for their applications in light conversion devices. In this work,
by an ingenious chemical approach of in situ doping, N-doped graphene
quantum dots (N-GQDs) have been synthesized with tailored green photoluminescence
(PL) under ultraviolet (UV) light excitation. The incorporation of
N atoms in the form of pyridinic and graphitic C–N bonding
into the sp2-hybridized graphitic framework of N-GQDs has
led to tailored LDS via PL emissions. The LDS property of synthesized
N-GQDs has been advantageously utilized to demonstrate enhanced responsivity
(R) of a low-cost commercially available photoconductive
cell (PC) for detection of UVA radiation through an indigenous technique.
The linear optical responses of samples are optimized by varying the
concentration and the dispersing medium. Also the N-GQDs are shown
to be photostable in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel. A 60% enhancement
in photocurrent of the PC-based photodetector under UV radiation has
been obtained here by using N-GQDs/PVA as LDS material. Thus, detection
of UVA radiation with a high specific detectivity (D*) of 9 × 1013 Jones and responsivity (R) of 3 A W–1 has been demonstrated, which might
open the opportunity of using this material in future energy conversion
devices.

1 Introduction
The
fascinating optical properties of graphene quantum dots (GQDs)
have led to new advancements for its photonic applications. GQDs have
a number of distinct merits, such as low toxicity, high photostability,
and easy synthesis,1,2 which make them attractive for
applications in bioimaging,3 sensors,4 energy storage,5 and
optoelectronic devices.6−10 The optical properties of GQDs are still regarded as an imperative
research topic, to reveal the exact origin of their luminescence and
to optimize it for light-emitting applications. The photoluminescence
(PL) emission mechanisms of GQDs mainly rely on: (i) the formation
of molecular fluorophore and their contribution to the strong emission
of the resulting sample3,11 and (ii) the intrinsic (band
gap related) emission from sp2 carbon core of GQDs.6,8 Theoretical calculations and experimental studies have pointed out
that the intrinsic emission in GQDs can be controlled by tailoring
of the chemical and electronic environments of their conjugated sp2 domains by means of substitutional doping of heteroatoms.8,12 Among many other heteroatoms, nitrogen (N) serves as a natural dopant
for GQDs since it is electron-rich and has a similar atomic size to
carbon. Modulation in the photophysics of GQDs and/or carbon quantum
dots (CQDs) is possible by incorporating N atoms into their sp2 carbon matrix, and recently, Zhang et al. have shown that
the fluorescence quantum yield of nitrogen- and sulfur-doped GQDs
is 84 times higher than that of Ru(bpy)3Cl2,
which is 9.3-fold higher than that of undoped GQDs.13

Li et al. reported for the first time synthesis of
N-doped GQDs
(N-GQDs) from tetrabutylammonium perchlorate and demonstrated the
superior electrocatalytic ability of the synthesized materials.14 Several groups showed that PL intensity of GQDs
can be enhanced significantly by N-doping.14−16 Santiago et
al. reported pulsed laser ablation technique to synthesize N-GQDs
from commercially available GO, where urea and diethylenetriamine
were used separately as N dopants.16,17 In some recent
studies, the hydrothermal/solvothermal method was suggested for the
synthesis of N-GQDs by using different precursors18,19 and solvents3 for achieving high PL quantum
yield (PLQY). However, some of the previously used methods of synthesis
of N-doped GQDs are limited by the critical synthesis conditions and/or
due to their requirements of very expensive experimental setup. Also
the synthesis of luminescence N-GQDs from the same precursor with
different levels of N doping is very much essential to understand
their PL mechanism.

Apart from their promising biomedical and
chemical sensing applications,
carbon-based emerging environment-friendly phosphors have received
significant interest in different lighting applications due to their
luminescent downshifting (LDS) property.20,21 In energy-generation devices as well as in some optoelectronic devices,
there is a high demand of LDS materials for increasing their efficiency
as well as protecting them from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiations.22−24 Recently, Tian et al. have used red- and green-emitting carbon dot
phosphors on commercially available blue-emitting InGaN chips for
making white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).10 Performance of the CQD-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film as a UV radiation
protecting layer has also been reported earlier.25 Because of the excellent UV-light absorption capability,
silane-functionalized GQDs have been used as a full-band UV-shielding
material,26 and it gives an idea about
their LDS application. However, some of the essential criteria for
a luminescent species to be applicable as LDS material are:27 (i) wide absorption band in the region where
the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photosensing device is
low; (ii) good separation between the absorption and emission bands
to minimize the photo-reabsorption losses; and (iii) low cost. Therefore,
synthesis of GQDs having full-band UV absorption (200–400 nm)
and which can produce a highly intense narrow band emission of light
in the visible regions are very much required. Further, as mentioned
earlier, the optical properties of GQDs can be tuned by changing the
chemical and electronic environments of their conjugated sp2 domains12 by means of substitutional
doping of heteroatoms. Considering these aspects, N doping into the
sp2 skeleton of GQDs could be an excellent way of designing
a new carbon-based LDS material for photonic applications.

For
decades, development of innovative strategies28−30 for sensing
of ultraviolet (UV) radiation has drawn extensive attention
due to wide range of applications in civilian and military areas,
such as water sterilization, optical communication, missile plume
detection, and so on.31 Responsivity, detectivity,
response time, and linear response with radiation intensity are regarded
as critical performance parameters of a UV detector in all application
areas. For example, UV detectors made of photoconductive materials
are used in flame detection with a responsivity of 0.1 A W–1, high detectivity of the order of 1010 Jones, and a short
response time of 1–3 s.32 Besides,
the ability of room-temperature operation, large photosensitive area,
and low cost of assembling are some of the essential advantages of
a photoconductor-type UV detector for practical applications. Perhaps
for these reasons, journey of CdS started in the 1960s, as a photoconductive
cell (PC) to detect optical radiation.30 Although PCs have a much higher sensitivity than a photodiode, they
exhibit a nonlinear photocurrent response upon incidence of light.33 More importantly, the detection of UV radiation
by using a commercially available CdS (band gap = 2.43 eV) PCs is
not possible as it is hardly sensitive to UV photons.34 On the other hand, there are several reports on the use
of LDS materials as a light-shifting component to improve the efficiency
of solar cells.22−24 Bella et al. proposed the use of photocurable LDS
fluoropolymers for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite
solar cells.22 Similarly, a GQD-based LDS
polymer layer for enhancing the efficiency of a crystalline silicon
solar cell was reported by Lee et al.35 Therefore, the aforementioned LDS property of GQDs could be used
for boosting up the UV-light-sensing performance of a PC.

Here,
we have reported the hydrothermal synthesis of green luminescent
N-GQDs. In this work, p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA) has been used as a source of carbon and urea for
doping of N atoms. The PL emission intensity of the samples has been
found to be varied with the concentration of N dopant, and a 6-fold
enhancement in PL intensity of N-GQDs has been demonstrated. Further,
we have demonstrated here a novel approach for improvement in responsivity
of a commercial CdS PC in UVA region by using N-GQDs as LDS material.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) studies are carried out to reveal the successful insertion
of N atoms into the sp2-hybridized carbon core in the form
of pyridinic and graphitic N, leading to the formation of a new energy
state within the band gap of the material. The emission of visible
green light in N-GQDs under UV irradiation has been used to improve
the photosensitivity of a CdS PC, which otherwise shows poor photoconductivity
under UV irradiation. To improve the photocurrent responsivity of
PC in the UV region, N-GQD/PVA (N-GQDs in PVA hydrogel) gel has been
used as the LDS material. Furthermore, responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) of the designed
photodetector are found to be highly sensitive to the concentration
of N dopant in N-GQDs. The photodetection circuit thus designed has
been found to be very much effective in the detection of UVA radiation
with an impressive linear photocurrent response unlike the bare CdS
PC and other wide-band-gap semiconductor photodetectors. Moreover,
synthesized N-GQDs may find applications in live cell microscopy.36

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation and Structural Features of N-GQDs
In this
work, N-GQDs has been hydrothermally synthesized by using p-PDA as a source of carbon and urea for N-doping in GQDs.37 The doping concentration of N atoms into GQDs
has been varied by taking various concentrations of urea during the
hydrothermal process. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of N-GQDs (viz. for N-GQD3) shown in Figure 1a depicts the presence of spherical carbon
nanostructures having an average size of ∼6 nm. The inset of Figure 1a shows the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image of a single N-GQD of spherical shape with a highly
crystalline core. The enlarged view of region I (inset of Figure 1a) is shown in Figure 1b. Figure 1b clearly depicts the formation
of zone boundary (yellow dotted curved line), which may have arisen
due to the formation of large graphitic core of the N-GQDs from tiny
π conjugated carbon structures. Moreover, the enlarged view
of rectangular region II shown in the inset (bottom right) of Figure 1b, confirms the formation
of hexagonal honeycomb graphitic lattice with zigzag edges. On the
basis of the image intensity profiles (Figure 1c) derived from single-pixel line traces
1 and 2 in (parallel to the zigzag chains and crossing the centers
of the carbon hexagons), the lattice constant has been estimated to
be 0.26 nm, which corresponds to the (1120) plane of graphene.38 The Raman spectrum of the N-GQD3 sample has
been collected at a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm, and it
is shown in Figure 1d along with the fitted curves. It is found that the Raman spectrum
consists of two bands, one having center ∼1390 cm–1, corresponding to D band and the other at ∼1550 cm–1 due to the G band of the disordered graphitic structures.39 However, the finite crystalline size in the
presence of defects in N-GQD3 might have caused the broadening in
the D and G bands of the Raman spectrum.40 Dimension of the sp2 core has also been calculated to
be ∼7 nm41 by using the data of
intensity ratio ID/IG = 0.68 of D band (ID) and G band
(IG) Raman peaks. The value of ID/IG in the present
study is large enough compared to that of the pure graphitic structures
(∼0.365),42 and it is due to the
presence of zone boundary-related defect states as mentioned earlier.
We have also measured the Raman spectrum of N-GQD4 as shown in Figure S2 along with the fitted curves. In this
case, the G band is shifted from 1550 cm–1 in N-GQD3
to ∼1620 cm–1 in N-GQD4, due to the increase
in lattice defect in sp2 core of N-GQDs.43 Due to the increase in defect levels, the ID/IG ratio has been found
to increase to 1.86 in N-GQD4.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurement has been carried
out to investigate the changes in the chemical environment and composition
of N-GQDs before and after addition of N-dopant during the synthesis. Figure 2a shows the full-scan
XPS images of the N-GQDs, which consist of three peaks at ∼284,
400, and 530.2 eV, due to the presence of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively.
A significant enhancement of N-to-C ratio from 12 to 25% has been
observed when the concentration of urea is increased from 0 to 1.6
mM.

XPS image (corresponding to N 1s peak) of N-GQD1 and N-GQD3, respectively.
(d) FTIR spectra of N-GQD1 and N-GQD3 samples.

The value of atomic ratio N/C in N-GQD3 (25%) is larger than
that
of graphene-based materials reported earlier by some other studies,14,44 and it indicates the successful incorporation of N atoms into the
sp2 carbon matrix by the present method. Also the value
of O/C is found to be increased in the case of N-GQD3 sample due to
the presence of oxygen in urea and oxidation of p-PDA during the hydrothermal process. Furthermore, to determine the
C–N configuration before and after addition of N-dopant, the
high-resolution N 1s spectra of the synthesized N-GQDs samples have
been deconvoluted, as shown in Figure 2b,c. The deconvoluted N 1s spectrum of N-GQD1 in Figure 2b clearly depicts
the presence of two components centered at 398.2 and 400.6 eV, which
correspond to pyridinic N (sp2-hybridized N atom with two
carbon atoms) and pyrrolic N (sp3-hybridized N atom with
five carbon atoms).16 These pyridinic N
and pyrrolic N are also present in the N-GQD3 sample, as shown in Figure 2c. However, it has
been observed that the dominant pyrrolic N in N-GQD1 (40%) decreases
with the concentration of N-dopant and it becomes 9% in the case of
N-GQD3 sample (Figure 2b,c). On the other hand, the amount of pyridine N has been enhanced
from 60 to 84% with increase in dopant concentration. Additionally,
the deconvoluted N 1s spectrum of N-GQD3 (Figure 2c) depicts the existence of a new component
at 401.5 eV due to the presence of graphitic N (substitution of one
carbon atom in the hexagonal graphitic lattice by N atom). The high
density of pyridinic N with the appearance of graphitic N in N-GQD3
sample indicates the high possibility of radiative recombination12 compared to that in the N-GQD1 sample. However,
these results suggest that the use of urea as a base and N-dopant
in the reaction environment can lead to the incorporation of N atoms
into the graphitic matrix of N-GQDs in the form of pyridinic N and
graphitic N, which can contribute extra electrons to the π-electron
system. Therefore, formation of a new energy state occurs near the
Fermi levels with electron-rich density distribution (Nπ* states)
and change in the valance band structure may occur.45 Hence, PL intensity of N-GQDs is found to be increased
(as presented later) with the increased concentration of N-dopant.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of synthesized N-GQD1
and N-GQD3 samples are shown in Figure 2d. The IR absorption peaks at ∼3389 and 3269
cm–1 are due to the stretching mode of vibration
of O–H and N–H groups,46 respectively.
Most notably, the sharp absorption due to the presence of O–H
groups in N-GQD1 becomes broader in N-GQD3, indicating its high degree
of carbonization.47 Also the appearance
of absorption band at ∼1560 cm–1 (due to
the stretching vibration of C=C bonds) in N-GQD3 suggests the
formation of N-GQDs with large sp2-hybridized graphitic
core in the presence of urea. However, the absorption band due to
the stretching vibration of C=C bond is completely absent in
the N-GQD1 sample. Additionally, the sharp IR absorption band at ca.
1450–1370 cm–1 is associated with the stretching
and bending modes of vibration of −N bonds48 in the N-GQD3 sample and is hardly present in those samples
synthesized without using urea, i.e., N-GQD1. Consistently, XPS measurement
also revealed the presence of these C–N bondings, as discussed
earlier.

On the basis of our experimental observations as discussed,
herein,
the formation mechanism of luminescent N-GQDs from p-PDA in the presence of urea has been described by using the reaction
pathway shown in Scheme 1. In the absence of urea at elevated temperature, p-PDA immediately forms dimers and trimers. The formation of rigid
polymers containing phenazine units occurred4 after polymerization of these oligomers, and thereafter N-GQDs (N-GQD1)
are formed via the carbonization process. Under hydrothermal condition,
the polymerization is mostly due to the formation of radical cations
and radical coupling,4 leading to the synthesis
of N-GQDs containing several amino/hydroxyl functional groups on their
surfaces. During the high-temperature treatments, the pyridinic and
pyrrolic N functionalities are formed in fewer amounts replacing the
oxygen-containing groups on the carbon.49 The formation of N-GQDs may have occurred in two intermediate steps:
(i) At elevated temperatures, urea can gradually release amide and/or
ammonia50 and (ii) those continually react
with the oxygen functional groups of N-GQD1, which is highly favorable
for doping of N atoms inside the graphitic skeleton.51 Importantly, in the present study, we have been able to
control the level of nitrogen doping by varying the concentration
of urea during the synthesis of N-GQDs from p-PDA
and thus the PL emission intensity of the synthesized N-GQDs has been
tuned as shown later.

2.2 Optical
Properties of N-GQDs and the Role
of N Doping
The optical properties of all as-synthesized
samples have been investigated by UV–vis absorption and PL
spectroscopies, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The UV–vis absorption spectra of
all N-GQD samples are shown in Figure 3a, which also depicts the presence of a sharp absorption
peak at ∼264 nm due to the π → π* transition
of electrons in sp2-hybridized graphitic domains. It is
found that there exist two more absorption peaks at ∼332 and
362 nm in the longer-wavelength (low-energy) region of 300–400
nm, as shown in the inset of Figure 3a. The absorption band at ∼362 nm is related
to n → π* electronic transition due to the presence of
conjugated C–N/C=N bonds.52 Furthermore, to confirm the origin of absorption at ∼362
nm, we have also performed the reduction experiment for all kinds
of N-GQDs in the presence of NaBH4, and almost unaltered
absorption characteristics in lower-energy region have been observed
(see Figure S3, Supporting Information).
On the other hand, the absorption band ∼332 nm is associated
with n → π* electronic transitions of C=C and
C=O bonds in the synthesized N-GQDs.3,53 It
is found that 332 nm absorption band is almost absent in the N-GQD1
sample, but those two peaks clearly appeared in other samples and
are most intense in the N-GQD4 sample. This observation suggests that
some amount of oxygen-containing functional groups may have been attached
onto the surface of N-GQDs during their synthesis in the presence
of urea. We have also observed that the intensity ratio of absorption
peaks at ∼264 and 362 nm increases with dopant concentration
(Figure 3b), and this
result indicates higher sp2 C content (C=C) within
the N-GQDs in the presence of N-dopant (as discussed earlier). Moreover,
the enhancement in UV absorption intensity of the N-GQD samples with
high dopant concentration (Figure 3a, inset) gives a notion to their use as an LDS material
in photovoltaic applications.27 However,
compared to the N-GQD3 sample, N-GQD4 exhibits quenching in absorption
intensity, which is a consequence of reduction in the amount of sp2 content within the N-GQD4 sample54 and is due to excessive insertion of graphitic N inside the core.

into single N-GQDs; bottom: at high concentration, a number of single
N-GQDs agglomerated to form nanosized clusters; the insets show the
corresponding TEM images of N-GQDs at low and high concentrations.

The synthesized N-GQDs exhibit
usual excitation wavelength-dependent
(λex-dependent) PL emission behavior. As shown in Figure 3c, PL emission intensity
is found to increase with the excitation wavelength, becomes the highest
at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm, and then decreased. Notably,
a red shift in PL emission center (λem) from 522
to 547 nm is also observed when excitation wavelength was varied from
375 to 425 nm. Such excitation-dependent PL emission of N-GQDs can
help to control the efficiency of an LDS layered photovoltaic device
just by doing a small variation of incident optical wavelength. Moreover,
a good separation between the absorption and emission bands of N-GQDs
is beneficial for their LDS applications as it can minimize losses
due to reabsorption.27 The least possibility
of reabsorption in the case of the synthesized LDS material, i.e.,
N-GQDs, has been confirmed by the calculation of emission overlap
(EO) integral as discussed later. Interestingly, in this work, we
have envisioned to tune the UV to visible light conversion efficiency
of the synthesized N-GQDs by controlling the incorporation of N atoms
into the sp2 carbon matrix. Figure S4a (Supporting Information) depicts the PL emission spectra
(λex = 375 nm) of all samples synthesized with different
concentrations of N dopant (0–3.2 mM), and PL intensity of
the N-GQD3 sample is found to be enhanced by 6 times compared to that
of the N-GQD1 sample. Moreover, the PLQY of the N-GQD sample has been
calculated (Supporting Information) in
aqueous medium by using rhodamine 6G as a reference, and it is found
to be 20% for N-GQD3, which is the highest among those of all other
samples (Figure 3d).
The digital photograph presented in the inset of Figure 3d clearly demonstrates the
perceptible change in the intensity of visible green luminescence
of N-GQD samples with dopant concentration when exposed to 365 nm
UV irradiation. Such an emission of green light from the synthesized
samples under 365 nm UV lamp (6 W) renders its LDS capability under
UV excitation. On the other hand, PL emission center of the synthesized
N-GQD samples is found to be red-shifted by an amount of 20 nm with
increase in the concentration of N-dopant, as depicted in Figure S4b (Supporting Information). On the basis
of this observation of red shift in the PL emission center of N-GQDs,
we believed that the presence of urea in precursor solution could
act as a base to facilitate dehydration reaction55 during the hydrothermal process to form a larger π-conjugated
graphitic core in N-GQDs as well as more incorporation of nitrogen
atoms into the sp2 carbon matrix occurs. Moreover, the
narrowing in the line shape of PL emission spectrum of N-GQDs (Figure S4c, Supporting Information) has been
observed with increasing concentration of N-dopant, due to the effective
improvement in the possibility of radiative recombination of electron–hole
pairs. Hence, we have achieved a highly intense PL emission in the
case of the N-GQD3 sample, which is 6 times higher than that of the
N-GQD1 sample. Such an enhancement in PL emission due to improved
radiative recombination of electron–hole pair could be correlated
to the increased density of pyridinic N atoms into the graphitic backbone
of the N-GQD3 sample, which has been confirmed by XPS data analyses
(as discussed earlier). However, quenching in PL intensity with further
increase in N-dopant concentration, as observed in N-GQD4 sample,
may be due to the instability of chemisorbed N on C at high N radical
concentration.45 As discussed earlier,
excessive insertion of graphitic N inside the graphitic core also
caused the reduction in sp2 content in N-GQDs. Therefore,
if graphitic N enters the graphite structure, it will change sp2 to sp3, which will destroy the conjugated structure.
Thus, too much graphitic N is not good for the green PL emission.

Furthermore, herein, we have also studied the PL emission behavior
of the N-GQD3 sample with varying concentrations, to (i) find the
optimum concentration of the synthesized sample to achieve highly
intense PL emission for LDS applications and (ii) reveal the possible
origin of excitation-dependent PL emissive behavior of N-GQDs samples.
As shown in Figure S4d (Supporting Information),
the PL emission intensity (λex = 375 nm) of N-GQD3
is found to be enhanced with concentration and becomes the highest
at a concentration of 1 mg mL–1. When the concentration
of N-GQD is further increased, quenching in PL emission takes place,
mainly due to aggregation of nanostructures, which is known as “aggregation-caused
quenching”.56 In addition, high
optical density or turbidity at higher concentration may also lead
to reduction in PL intensity in fluorescent carbon nanostructures.57 Thus, the concentration of N-GQDs used should
be carefully maintained to investigate the PL mechanism and light
conversion applications.

When N-GQDs are illuminated by UV excitation,
the absorbed photons
may cause electronic transitions of ∼4.7 eV (264 nm, π
→ π* of C=C), 3.73 eV (332 nm, n → π*
of C=O), and 3.4 eV (362 nm, n → π* of C=N)
producing three absorption bands in the UV–vis spectrum (as
discussed earlier). The excited electrons can be deactivated by two
means: (i) through band-to-band recombination (Cπ* →
π transition) after vibration relaxation, producing PL in high-energy
region; (ii) by undergoing intersystem crossing (Cπ* →
Nπ* and Nπ* → Oπ*), followed by vibration
relaxation, and finally radiative recombination (interstate to band
transitions; N,Oπ* → π) occurs in the longer-wavelength
region.44 The latter is more effective
at high concentration of fluorophore molecule.53 To find the emissive states that are responsible for excitation-dependent
PL emission in N-GQDs, we have collected the PL excitation (PLE) spectra
(λem = 520 nm) of the N-GQD3 sample at different
concentrations, as shown in Figure 3e. PLE spectra of N-GQD3 at higher concentration exhibits
existence of three emission bands at ∼230, 330, and 377 nm.
The transition at ∼230 nm (5.39 eV) corresponds to the electronic
transition from σ orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO), i.e., Cπ* state, and it arises due to the presence
of carbene-like zigzag sites at the edges of the synthesized graphitic
carbon nanostructures58 (as evident from
HRTEM observations). However, the transitions at ∼330 nm (3.76
eV) and 377 nm (3.29 eV) are due to N,Oπ* → π transitions
due to the presence of C=O and conjugated C–N/C=N
bonds, respectively. Interestingly, a new PLE band at ∼260
nm (4.77 eV) has aroused when the N-GQD sample was diluted to lower
concentration. The PLE peak at ∼260 nm, corresponding to Cπ*
→ π transitions, originates from sp2 core,
and it is known as band-to-band transition. As depicted in Figure 3f, at lower concentration
(0.05–0.125 mg mL–1) of N-GQDs, Cπ*
→ π transition is allowed due to the separation of individual
N-GQDs and N,Oπ* → π transitions are less allowed
in this case. However, interstate transitions are more probable when
N-GQDs are in high concentration (1 mg mL–1) and
is due to aggregation of individual nanoparticles. TEM images shown
in Figure 3h are taken
at a concentration of 0.025 mg mL–1 (top inset)
and 1 mg mL–1 (bottom inset), which confirms the
separation of individual N-GQDs at low concentration and their aggregation
at higher concentrations, respectively. Furthermore, it has been observed
that all N-GQDs samples (i.e., N-GQD2-4) exhibit a lower level of
λex-dependent emission characteristics at the lowest
concentration of 0.025 mg mL–1 as shown in the excitation-dependent
PL emission spectra in Figure S5 (Supporting
Information). However, the maximum amount of λex-dependent
shift in PL emission center (Δλ in nm) has been observed
in N-GQD4 at a concentration of 1 mg mL–1 and is
equal to 42 nm (Figure S5c-i, Supporting
Information). From these experimental observations, we have concluded
that two types of emissive centers are present within the synthesized
N-GQDs. The low level of λex-dependent emission characteristics
of N-GQDs at very low concentration is due to the PL emission from
intrinsic sp2 carbon core (Cπ* → π;
band-to-band transition). However, comparatively, a large λex-dependent shift in PL emission center of the synthesized
sample at higher concentration is due to PL emission from interstate
to band transitions (N,Oπ* → π).53 Additionally, the polar groups on the surface of the particles
are of particular importance to determine the emissive property of
carbon nanostructures as demonstrated earlier by us.59 For higher concentrations of samples, the surface moieties
of N-GQDs help to form nanoclusters, as shown in Figure 3h (bottom inset). As the amount
of surface moieties is increased with dopant concentration, the value
of Δλ is found to be the highest in the case of N-GQD4
compared to that of other samples. On the other hand, the as-formed
nanoclusters are separated and redispersed into single N-GQD when
the aqueous solution of N-GQDs is diluted to low concentration (TEM
image in Figure 3h,
top inset). This leads to weakening of the van der Waals attraction
in between N-GQDs and the emission in the longer-wavelength region
due to the disappearance of interstate transitions.53 Such investigations on concentration-dependent PL emission
behavior of the N-GQDs will provide a way to tune the emission wavelength
and offer new insights into the PL emission mechanism in luminescent
carbon nanostructures, which will promote diverse potential applications
of the synthesized material in the near future.

Moreover, the
photostability of a luminescent material is an important
criterion for its different applications, especially as an LDS material.27 The photostability of synthesized N-GQDs has
been studied under 1 h continuous exposure of UV radiation after dissolving
them in deionized (DI) water and PVA hydrogel. As shown in Figure S6a (Supporting Information), the relative
PL intensity of the N-GQD sample is found to be remarkably constant
in PVA hydrogel compared to DI water. In Figure S6b,c (Supporting Information), we have shown a comparison
of fluorescence stability of N-GQDs in DI water and PVA hydrogel,
and it is found that when N-GQDs are dispersed in PVA hydrogel, they
remain stable for up to 12 days. Moreover, in our previous study,
we have also reported that60 the transmittance
of the PVA consisting of carbon nanostructures has high transmittance
in the visible region and is comparable to bare PVA. On the basis
of these observations and discussions, in this study, we have used
PVA hydrogel as a suitable matrix to demonstrate the LDS application
of synthesized N-GQDs.

2.3 Application of N-GQDs as
Luminescent Downshifter
The fascinating LDS response of N-GQDs
under UV excitation has
been judiciously utilized for enhancement in responsivity of a PC,
and thereby detection of UV (UVA) radiation has been demonstrated
by using an indigenously designed experimental setup, as shown in Figure 4a. A very low-cost
commercially available 0.5 cm CdS PC has been used as a light sensor,
and a transistor (Q1) operating in common emitter mode
is used to amplify the photocurrent across the PC. Photoresponse of
a PC strongly depends on the band gap of photosensitive material (CdS)
and hence on photon wavelength. We have also measured the spectral
response of the CdS PC at five different wavelengths for calibration,
as shown in Figure 4b, and the responsivity of PC is found to be 5 times higher under
green light (532 nm) compared to that of UV light of wavelength 395
nm. This observation confirms that the PC, which has been used as
a photosensor, is less sensitive to UV radiation compared to visible
light and hence motivates us to use the as-synthesized N-GQDs LDS
to improve its photocurrent response.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental
setup for the detection
of UVA radiation by using N-GQDs as an LDS material, where UV blind
PC acts as a light sensor. (b) Responsivity of the CdS PC operating
under five different wavelengths. (c) Polar plot of green emission
intensity from N-GQDs inside the cuvette under UV excitation in different
direction. (d) Emission spectra of the output red LED at different
intensities of UV radiation in input, and the corresponding digital
images of the red LED are shown in the inset.

A schematic of the experimental setup for CdS PC-based light
detection
system is shown in Figure 4a. Briefly, light from UV light source has been focused (spot
area: 0.3 cm2) on the first surface of a four-side-polished
quartz cuvette (1 cm) containing N-GQDs dispersed in PVA hydrogel
(Figure 4a). Thereafter,
the visible green light emitted by N-GQDs under UVA excitation has
been collected through PC. A digital photograph of the experimental
setup is shown in Figure S7a (Supporting
Information). The intensity of the UVA radiation has been varied by
changing the biasing voltage across the UVA source LED. The intensity
response of the source LED with biasing voltage is given in Figure S7b (Supporting Information). Figure 4c shows that the
intensity of green light emitted from N-GQDs is the maximum in a plane
perpendicular to the first surface (incident plane of UV radiation)
of the cuvette. Therefore, the PC has been placed in a plane perpendicular
to the first surface of the cuvette. The photocurrent of the detector
circuit has been measured by varying the intensity of the incident
UVA radiation. Furthermore, the intensity of light emission from a
red LED kept at the output of the detector circuit also changes with
the intensity of incident radiation at input, as shown in Figure 4d.

The photocurrent
(Iph) response of
PC with intensity of UVA radiation has been investigated at different
concentrations of N-GQDs in PVA hydrogel, and the results are shown
in Figure 5a. However,
the value of responsivity R has been estimated from
the slope of the linear variation of photocurrent with the optical
power of incident UVA radiation (Figure S7c, Supporting Information). Notably, the responsivity of PC under
UVA irradiation is found to be doubled when the concentration of the
N-GQDs in PVA hydrogel was increased to 0.6 mg mL–1. Such amplification in responsivity of PC is due to enhancement
in the intensity of green emission from N-GQDs with its concentration
in the presence of UVA irradiation. In addition, the detectivity D* (in units of Jones) is commonly reported as an important
parameter to characterize the sensitivity of a photodetector30 and is defined as 1  and 2  where IL and Id are currents
in the presence of light and
dark, respectively, q is the electronic charge, Aeff is the active area (0.03 cm2)
of the exposed surface of PC participating in absorption of photon
emitted by N-GQDs, and Ei is the intensity
of light incident on the exposed surface of PC. The detectivity of
PC-based UV detector circuit has been calculated under the light illumination
of 0.8 mW cm–2 and is observed to be increasing
with concentration of N-GQDs, as shown in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 (a) Photocurrent response of PC-based UVA detector
by using different
concentrations of N-GQDs as a light conversion material. (b) Variation
of responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) of the detector with concentration of N-GQDs. (c) Photocurrent
response of PC-based UVA detector by using all of the synthesized
N-GQD samples (0.6 mg mL–1) in PVA hydrogel as LDS
material. (d) Variation of R and D* of the detector with concentration of N-dopant used to synthesize
N-GQDs.

To find the effectiveness of N-doping
in N-GQDs on its LDS application,
the photocurrent response of the PC has also been studied in the presence
of all synthesized N-GQD samples (0.6 mg mL–1) and
the results are shown in Figure 5c,d. The linear variation of photocurrent with intensity
of input UVA irradiation in the presence of different N-GQD samples
is shown in Figure 5c. By using N-GQD3 as a converter of UV light, the highest photocurrent
of 0.035 mA is achieved at an irradiation of 0.8 mW cm–2. From the linear variation of photocurrent with the optical power
of incident UVA radiation (Figure S7d,
Supporting Information), the value of responsivity R has been estimated. In the present study, we have observed that
the values of R and D* are strongly
dependent on the amount of N-doping in N-GQDs. As depicted in Figure 5d and Table 1, by using the N-GQD3 sample
(N-dopant concentration, 1.6 mM) as an optical wavelength converter
at the input of the PC-based detection circuit, maximum achievable
values of R and D* are found to
be 3 A W–1 and 9 × 1013 Jones, respectively.

The performance of a luminescent
species as an LDS material depends
on the optical properties, viz., on the PLQY, separation between the
absorption and emission bands and how well its PL emission band spectrally
matched with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) band of the photosensor.22 By considering these aspects, here we have also
calculated the value of EO and emission spectral matching (ESM) integral.
EO gives the possibility of photo-reabsorption quantitatively, and
it should be zero ideally for LDS material with no overlap between
the absorption and emission spectra. The value of EO has been evaluated
in terms of a normalized emission profile (Iem(λ)) and absorption profile (Iabs(λ)) of the LDS material, i.e., N-GQDs in solution
phase23 by using eq 3 (Figure 6a) 3  However, ESM characterizes
the overlap between
the emission band of LDS material and the EQE profile of the photosensor.
The value of ESM has been estimated in terms of the normalized emission
profile (Iabs(λ)) of the LDS material
and the normalized EQE band (ηb(λ)) of the
bare photosensor by eq 4 (Figure 6b). For
an LDS material having an emission profile perfectly overlapping with
the EQE band of the photosensor, ESM would be nearly unity. ESM is
defined as 4  The values of EO and ESM have been calculated
for all of the synthesized N-GQD samples, and the results are presented
in Table 1. As shown
in Figure 6a, the absorption
and emission bands of N-GQD3 sample are found to be well separated
with the EO value of 0.55%, which is the minimum among all other synthesized
samples. However, the maximum value of ESM is found to be 40% for
the N-GQD3 sample, and the comparative data for all samples are given
in Table 1. Moreover,
the values of EQ and ESM are better than those of Q Switch 5 and IR-26
dye.23

merit of N-GQD3 used as
an LDS material. (a) Emission overlap (EO) integral, (b) emission
spectral matching (ESM) integral, (c) cartoon of PC-based UVA detector
by using N-GQD fluorophore as LDS material. (i) UV light is directly
collected near the surface of the bare PC (gray box) and giving low
efficiency. (ii) With the addition of the LDS material, UV light is
absorbed by the N-GQD/PVA gel (green box) and reemitted in the visible
region where it is collected in the active region of the PC with improved
detection efficiency.

The conductivity of a conventional CdS PCs is usually enhanced
after absorbing visible photons and hence exhibits a better photocurrent
response after absorbing only those visible photons having energy
(Eph) equal or around the band gap energy
(Eg) of photosensitive material. However,
if Eph is larger than Eg (as in the case of UV light), the photons are absorbed,
but the excess energy (Eph – Eg) is not used effectively for generation of
photocurrent, and it causes electron thermalization.35 As discussed earlier, the value of ESM characterizes the
overlap between the emission band of LDS material and the EQE band
of the used PC. In the present study, the value of ESM for the green
luminescent N-GQD3 is found to be 4 times higher than that of direct
UVA radiation (Table 1 and Figure 6b). Therefore,
under the visible emission from N-GQDs, the production of large number
of photoelectrons within PC is responsible for enhancement in its
conductivity compared to direct UVA radiation. As a consequence, the
presented light detection circuit under UVA excitation is able to
show an advanced photoresponsive behavior by using N-GQDs as LDS material.
Additionally, Figure S8 shows the variation
of photocurrent gain of the detector circuit using different N-GQDs
samples as LDS material for a particular intensity of incident UVA
radiation (0.8 mW cm–2). Clearly, 3.5 times enhancement
in the value of photocurrent gain has been observed by using N-GQD3/PVA
gel as the LDS material. Moreover, the photocurrent enhancement (ΔIph in %) in the PC-based photodetection circuit
in the presence of the N-GQD/PVA LDS gel has been estimated by eq 5 5  where Iph1 and Iph0 are the values
of photocurrent in the presence and absence of LDS at input, respectively.
Thus, the value of ΔIph is found
to be 60%, which is the maximum when the N-GQD3/PVA gel is used as
a luminescent downshifter. Notably, the calculated values of R and D* in the present study are comparable
to those of UV photodetectors, which have been reported earlier.30,61−64 Thus, the present work could be an addition to extend the state
of the art in fabrication and designing of UV detectors. In this report,
we have also proposed a benchtop design of PC-based UV detector, as
shown in Scheme 2,
where N-GQD/PVA gel could be used as an LDS material.

Scheme 2 Proposed
Benchtop Design of PC-Based UV Detector by Using N-GQD/PVA
Gel as LDS Material
To get information about the photoresponse time of PC-based
UV
detector, which has been designed here, we have measured its photoswitching
behavior under pulsating UV light (395 nm, 0.8 mW cm–2) of frequency 200 Hz (Figure S9, Supporting
Information). A clear saturation is observed in the transient signal
with a rise time (τrise) of 9 ms and a fall time
(τfall) of 8 ms in the UV detector system by using
N-GQD3/PVA gel as LDS material.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, here we have demonstrated the synthesis of N-doped
GQDs by an in situ chemical approach. The synthesized samples are
characterized using standard characterization tools, like TEM, XPS,
Raman, and FTIR spectroscopies, and the optical properties are determined
by using UV–vis absorption and PL emission spectroscopies.
The synthesized samples are found to exhibit tailored green PL emission
due to N doping under UV excitation, and thus the samples show LDS
property. The PLQY values of N-GQD samples have been calculated, and
a maximum value of 20% has been achieved. The origin of observation
of tunability of PL emissions and its quenching under higher N dopant
concentration in the samples have been discussed. The LDS property
of the synthesized samples has further been fruitfully utilized to
achieve an enhancement in the responsivity of a low-cost PC for detection
of UVA radiation through an indigenously developed technique. A 60%
enhancement in photocurrent of the PC-based photodetector has been
achieved by using N-GQDs/PVA gel as LDS material. The different characteristics
of the designed photodetector have been studied in relation to the
detection of UVA radiation, and a relatively large detectivity of
9 × 1013 Jones and responsitivity of 3 A W–1 have been reported. This work might open a new opportunity of using
N-GQDs as LDS material in future for photonic and energy conversion
devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical
grade. para-Phenylenediamine (p-PDA,
97%) and urea (99.5%) were used as a precursor for synthesis of N-GQDs
purchased from Loba Chemie and Merck, respectively. Silica gel (60–20
mesh) and acetone used for column chromatography were purchased from
Merck. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Merck) was used for making transparent
hydrogel solution of N-GQDs. Deionized (DI) water was used in all
experiments.

4.2 Instrumentation
A highly intense
LED (1 mW cm–2 at a biasing 6 V) having emission
wavelength at 395 nm has been procured from Probots Techno Solutions
(Bangalore, India) is used as a source of UVA radiation. The 5 mm
CdS PC (GL55 series with metal housing) for photosensing and an NPN
transistor (BC547) for photocurrent amplification were purchased from
a local market. The emission spectrum of the UVA LED and green light
emitted by N-GQDs under UV excitation was measured using an optical
fiber spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048). The photocurrent (mA) response
of the detector circuit was measured using a digital nanoammeter.

4.3 Preparation of N-GQDs
The method
of preparation of N-GQDs is described below briefly. In short, 1.8
mM p-PDA and 3.2 mM urea (N dopant) were dissolved
in 50 mL of DI water; then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave of 100 mL capacity. The precursor solution
is heated at 170 °C for 8 h and then it is allowed to cool at
room temperature. The as-obtained colloidal dark brownish suspension
is then purified by silica column chromatography using acetone as
eluent. It is worth noting that, to study the effect of nitrogen doping
on the fluorescence intensity of GQDs, the molar concentration of
N dopant is varied from 0 to 3.2 mM. The samples thus synthesized
by using 0, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mM concentrations of N dopant are symbolized
as N-GQD1, N-GQD2, N-GQD3, and N-GQD4, respectively. The details of
the experimental techniques for characterization of the synthesized
samples are discussed in the Supporting Information.
