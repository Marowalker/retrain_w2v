Herein, two bifunctional macromolecular aromatic epoxy resins (ERs), namely, 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol
oxirane (ERH) and 4,4′-isopropylidene tetrabromodiphenol oxirane
(ERBr), are synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as anticorrosive
materials for carbon steel corrosion in acidic medium. ERs were characterized
using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Investigated ERs acted
as effective corrosion inhibitors, and their inhibition effectiveness
followed the order ERBr (96.5%) > ERH (95.6%). Potentiodynamic
polarization
results showed that ERH and ERBr behave as predominantly anodic type
and the cathodic type of corrosion inhibitors, respectively. Adsorption
of both the studied ERH and ERBr molecules obeyed the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm model. Density functional theory and molecular dynamics studies
showed that protonated forms of ERH and ERBr contribute more to metal
(carbon steel)–inhibitor (ERH/ERBr) interactions than their
neutral forms.

1 Introduction
Acidic solutions are widely
employed in descaling, pickling, cleaning,
and oil acidification procedures through which damage of metallic
resources occurs by corrosion. Hydrochloric and sulfuric acids
are often utilized as pickling solutions for carbon and mild steel
surface cleaning, which are generally used to remove the scales and
light rusts; one of the examples being the cleaning of boilers.1,2 Numerous classes of organic, inorganic, and their mixed derivatives
are used repeatedly to combat corrosion, depending upon the nature
of practical, environmental, social, and economic aspects.3,4 One of the most important techniques to combat aqueous corrosion
inhibition is the consumption of macromolecular organic compounds
owing to their ease in synthesis, high effectiveness, and inexpensive
nature.5 Numerous natural and synthetic
polymeric materials have also been reported; nevertheless, because
of inadequate solubilities in polar electrolytes, their application
as corrosion inhibitors is restricted.6 Obviously, owing to their larger molecular size, macromolecular
compounds are featured by their ability to cover the larger metallic
surface area, thereby, behaving as effective corrosion inhibitors.
Most of the previously employed macromolecules contain aromatic ring(s)
and polar functional groups in their side chain that favor their adsorption
on the metallic surface through donor–acceptor interactions.7,8 The π-electrons of aromatic ring(s) in the aromatic macromolecular
compounds also help in their adsorption on the metallic surface.9,10

In view of the high inhibition effectiveness of the aromatic
macromolecular
compounds toward metallic corrosion, we herein reported the synthesis
and characterization of two bifunctional aromatic macromolecular epoxy
resins (ERs), namely, 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol oxirane (ERH)
and 4,4′-isopropylidene tetrabromodiphenol oxirane (ERBr).
The increasing popularity of bifunctional aromatic macromolecular
epoxy resins is mainly due to the cost-effective starting materials,
facile route of synthesis, high purity, and high inhibition effectiveness.7 Both inhibitors were synthesized using commercially
available cheap and nontoxic chemicals and solvents (isopropyl alcohol/water)
in high yield and were evaluated for their anticorrosive behavior
on carbon steel corrosion in 1 M HCl solution. The anticorrosive effect
of both bifunctional epoxy resins was evaluated using potentiodynamic
polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
techniques. Novelty of the study is that the inhibition effect of
both ERs is being reported for the first time and they are highly
effective showing superior protection efficiency compared to the previously
reported macromolecules as both ERH (Mw = 340 g/mol) and ERBr (Mw = 655 g/mol),
showing maximum inhibition efficiencies of 95.60 and 96.50%, respectively,
at 10–3 M concentration. Most of the previously
reported macromolecular organic inhibitors are insoluble or very less
soluble in the polar electrolytic media, such as in aqueous acidic
solutions, that limit their applications at the commercial level.
However, ERs selected in the present study are highly soluble in the
test electrolyte. The high inhibition of ERs is attributed to the
presence of more than a few electron-rich sites in the form of oxygen
and/or bromo atoms and π-electrons by way of which they can
adsorb effectually, mitigating corrosion attack thereafter. The present
study is also designed to demonstrate the effect of bromine atoms,
and both experimental and computational studies revealed that the
presence of bromine (four) atoms enhances the corrosion inhibition
effectiveness because of its electron-releasing ability to transfer
its unshared electron pairs into the d-orbital of surface metallic
atoms and enhancement in the electron density on donor sites (O-atom
and aromatic rings) due to its +R effect. Computational (DFT and MD)
studies showed that the protonated form of ERs exhibited better inhibition
efficiency compared to their neutral form.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Methods
All of the
chemicals employed in the study, including 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol
(≥99%), 4-4,4′-isopropylidenebis-(2,6-dibromophenol)
(97%), epichlorohydrin (99%), and triethylamine (≥99.5%), were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used devoid of any extra sanitization.
The test material (carbon steel) has the following element composition:
carbon steel strips containing C 0.11 wt %, Si 0.24 wt %, Mn 0.47
wt %, Cr 0.12 wt %, Mo 0.02 wt %, Ni 0.1 wt %, Al 0.03 wt %, Cu 0.14,
Co <0.0012 wt %, V <0.003 wt %, and W 0.06 wt %.11,12 The corrosive solution of 1 M HCl was prepared by diluting the appropriate
amount of concentrated HCl (37%) with distilled water. The concentration
range for the tested inhibitor was from 10–3 to
10–6 mol/L, and was determined after the study of
the solubility of the bifunctional macromolecular aromatic ERs in
the corrosive medium.13,14

2.2 Chemical Synthesis of ERs
The synthesis
of ERs used in the present study was achieved as follows. A mixture
of phenolic compound (aromatic diol) (2.0 × 10–2 mol) and ethanol (20 mL) was placed in a bicol equipped with a condenser
and a dropping funnel. In the above reaction mixture, 4.5 mL of epichlorohydrin
was added (dropwise) with constant stirring. The consequential reaction
mixture was allowed to heat up at 70 °C for 4 h. After that,
triethylamine (6 mL) was poured into the resulting mixture and stirred
subsequently for 3 h at 40 °C. The desired viscous macromolecular
aromatic epoxy resins (ERs) were obtained after removing the residual
solvents using a rotary evaporator. The scheme for the synthesis of
macromolecular aromatic epoxy resins is shown in Figure 1. Both synthesized ERs were
characterized by 1H NMR (registered with Bruker AVANCE
300 MHz) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) (registered with a
Bruker) spectroscopic techniques. The information related to the characterization
of ERs is given in Figures SI 1 and SI 2 and Table SI 1.

Figure 1 Schematic outline for the synthesis of ERH and ERBr.

2.3 Electrochemical Test
Before doing
the electrochemical measurements, the carbon steel specimens were
abraded using different grades (180–1200) of emery paper, washed
with distilled water and ethyl alcohol, and finally, degreased with
acetone. Electrochemical measurements of carbon steel dissolution
in 1 M HCl in the absence and presence of ERH and ERBr were performed
using the Potentiostat PS 200 device, as described in our previous
studies.5,7 The device is connected by means of a three-electrode
arrangement consisting of pure Pt as the auxiliary or assisting electrode
(CE), saturated calomel, the same as the reference electrode (SCE),
and carbon steel panels, the same as the working electrode (WE). Prior
to starting the electrochemical experiments, the WE was permitted
to corrode liberally with and without ERH and ERBr for 1800 s to acquire
the establishment of open-circuit potential (OCP). The EIS measurements
were performed over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz, using
10 mV amplitude. The PDP curves were measured at a scan rate of 1
mV/s from −800 to 0 mV versus SCE. To obtain more accuracy
and reproducibility of the experimental data, the electrochemical
studies were performed three times for each tested sample, and mean
values are reported.

2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Surface
Study
To sustain the PDP and EIS studies, the surface morphological
study was carried out using the SEM method. For the SEM study, cleaned
metallic strips were allowed to corrode for 12 h in the aggressive
acidic medium (test electrolyte) with and without ERH and ERBr. Thereafter, the metallic strips were taken out, washed with distilled
water, dried in vacuity, and examined for surface morphology using
S3000H, a Hitachi-field emission SEM instrument. Energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) analysis was also conducted coupled with SEM analysis
using the same instrument to obtain information about the elements
present on the surfaces.

2.5 Theoretical Study
The Gaussian 09
program package was adopted for geometric optimization of neutral
as well as a protonated form of ERH and ERBr molecules and DFT calculations.15 It is well established that organic inhibitors
undergo salvation in the aqueous electrolytic media; therefore, the
DFT study was conducted in the aqueous phase using the most frequently
employed basis set (B3LY) and functional P6-31G(d,p).16−18 After being fully optimized, several
DFT indices, including energies of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs),
were derived for solvated neutral and protonated ERH and ERBr molecules.
Local reactivity parameters, nucleophilicity, and electrophilicity
of the ERH and ERBr molecules were also derived to gain a better understanding
of metal–inhibitor interactions.

The MD simulation study
was adopted to study the mode and effectiveness of ERH and ERBr adsorption
on the carbon steel surface using the Forcite module of the Materials
Studio 8.0 program.19,20 It was carried out in a simulation
box (2.48 nm × 2.48 nm × 4.71 nm) with periodic boundary
conditions. The box consisted of a lower Fe slab and an upper solvent
layer (containing 800 water molecules and one inhibitor molecule).
For the iron substrate, Fe(110) was selected as the explored surface
because of the fact that it has a density packed structure and is
the most stable. The Fe(110) surface was modeled with a seven-layer
slab model. In this model, there were 100 iron atoms in each layer
representing a (10 × 10) unit cell.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Electrochemical Study
Open-circuit
potential (OCP) can be defined the same as “potential originated
over the working electrode (carbon steel in this case) without applying
any external current or potential”. Figure 2 represents the OCP versus time curves for
WE corrosion with and without ERH and ERBr for 1800 s. Generally,
the establishment of straight lines for OCP versus time curves suggests
the dissolution of the surface metal oxide layer(s) and adsorption
of the corrosion inhibitor(s) at the interface of the metal and the
electrolyte.21 In the present study, OCP
versus time curves were almost straight throughout the experiment,
which clearly suggests the establishment of steady-state potential
(EOCP) after immersing the carbon steel
samples in 1 M HCl for 1800 s. This observation also indicates that
surface oxides (mostly, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) are completely removed, and ERH and ERBr adsorption
has also been achieved. Careful inspection of the OCP versus time
(1800 s) curves showed that in the presence of ERH, the curves are
shifted toward more positive (anodic direction) than the OCP versus
time curves of uninhibited specimen, which suggests that ERH behaves
as a predominantly anodic type of inhibitor,21 whereas careful observation of OCP versus time curves for ERBr showed
that ERBr is a predominantly cathodic type of inhibitor.22

Polarization Tafel (anodic and cathodic) curves
for carbon steel
dissolution with and without ERH and ERBr are shown in Figure 3, and several indices including βc, βa, icorr, Rp (polarization resistance) and Ecorr derived
through the extrapolation method are presented in Table 1. Using icorr, inhibition efficiency (ηPDP%) was determined by the following equation (eq 1) 1  where icorr0 and icorr are the current densities
for steel corrosion in the absence and presence of inhibitors in acidic
solution, respectively.

The values (Table 1) of cathodic Tafel lines, βc,
show a slight change with an increasing inhibitor concentration, indicating
the influence of the 3,7-di(m-aminophenyl)-10-ethyl-phenothiazine derivative on the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. This may probably
be due to a diffusion or barrier effect. The values of the slopes
of the anodic Tafel lines, βa, were
noticeably changed, which proposes the role of inhibitor molecule
adsorption on the active anodic sites in the iron dissolution mechanism.
The anomalous behavior of anodic curves is related to the metal surface
passivation as a result of inhibitor film deposition.

Inspection
of the results (Table 1) showed that the values of icorr for
ERH and ERBr are decreasing upon increasing their
concentration, and the maximum decrease was obtained at 10–3 M concentration. The results further showed that at each studied
concentration, the icorr values for ERH
compared to the icorr values of ERBs clearly
indicate that the latter is a more effective inhibitor than the former
one. Both ERH and ERBr showed the highest efficiencies of 95.6 and
96.5%, respectively, at 10–3 M concentration. The
higher protectiveness of the ERBr compared to ERH can be attributed
to the presence of bromo (Br) in the molecular structure of ERBr that
enhances the electron density over the aromatic ring and thereby enhances
the probability of the metal–inhibitor (ERBr) interactions. Practically, elevated effectiveness
of ERs (ERH and ERBr) might be due to the presence of oxygen atoms
and aromatic rings that offer nonbonding and π-electrons, respectively,
during metal–inhibitor (ERH/ERBr) interactions. High protectiveness
of the ERBr compared to ERH is due to the presence of four additional
bromine atoms that can enhance the relative effectiveness of ERBr
by participating directly in the metal–inhibitor bonding or
enhancing the electron density at donor sites through its +R (resonance)
effect.

Nyquist plots for the corrosion of carbon steel in 1
M HCl without
and with ERH and ERBr are shown in Figure 4. Observation of the figure showed that Nyquist
plots in inhibited and uninhibited cases manifest a single semicircle,
indicating that the dissolution of WE in 1 M HCl with and without
ERH and ERBr involves the single charge transfer event. Similar shapes
of the inhibited (by ERH and ERBr) and uninhibited Nyquist curves
suggest that ERs inhibit corrosion through adsorbing at the interfaces
of the WE and the electrolyte without changing the mechanism of corrosion,
and its control is mainly governed by the charge transfer process.23 Surface roughness and imperfection originating
through natural and interfacial resources result in the imperfection
in the semicircle.24 An increase in the
diameter of the semicircle by increasing the concentration of ERH
and ERBr is owing to the constraint in the progression of the charge
transfer. An equivalent circuit engaged intended for appropriately
analyzing the EIS data, is shown in Figure 5. The constant phase element (CPE) is defined
as225−27 below 2  All physical symbols have their usual meaning.28 The Cdl (double
layer capacitance) can be calculated using329,30 3  The percentage of inhibition effectiveness
for ERH and ERBr was calculated using the following relationship (eq 4) 4  

Figure 4 Nyquist diagrams for carbon steel in 1 M HCl
solution in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of ERH (a) and ERBr (b).

Figure 5 Equivalent circuit used for the analysis of the EIS data.

Results derived for ERH and ERBr using the EIS
method are presented
in Table 2. It can
be seen that an increase in Rp values
was observed on increasing the concentrations of ERH and ERBr. This
increase in the protection efficiency of ERs on increasing their concentrations
is because of the subsequent increase in the corresponding surface
coverage values.5 The results and the order
of the protection efficiency of both ERH and ERBr were consistent
with the results, and the order of inhibition efficiency was derived
from the PDP study.31 ERH and ERBr showed
the maximum efficiencies of 94.3 and 95.7% for ERH and ERBr, respectively,
at 10–3 M concentration. Moreover, the increase
in ERH and ERBr concentrations resulted in a subsequent decrease in
the values of Cdl, which is a consequence
of an increase in the thickness of the electric double layer due to
the replacement of the preabsorbed water by ERH and ERBr molecules.32

Bode plots of acidic dissolution of carbon steel in
the absence
and presence of different concentrations of ERH and ERBr are shown
in Figure 6. The analysis
displays that the magnitude of slope values for the inhabited (by
ERH and ERBr) curves is greater than that of the uninhibited curves.
Among the investigated ERH and ERH, ERBr showed a higher slope value
than that of ERH, which implies that ERBr has higher effectiveness
toward the interaction with the metal surface compared to the ERH.

the absence and presence of different concentrations of ERH (a) and ERBr (b).

3.2 Morphological Analysis
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was conducted to support the EIS and PDP studies,
where the surfaces of the WE after corroding in 1 M HCl for 12 h with
and without ERH and ERBr were examined for the morphological microstructures.
SEM images of the WE surfaces are presented in Figure 7. It can be seen that the WE exterior (Figure 7a) is greatly corroded
and scratched in the absence of ERs, which might be a consequence
of its free corrosion in destructive acidic solution. However, the
WE surfaces inhibited by ERH and ERBr (Figure 7b) are astonishingly smoothened compared
to the uninhibited surface. This finding leads to convincing evidence
that ERH and ERBr restrain WE’s corrosion through their adsorption.
Furthermore, smoothness in the morphologies of inhibited surfaces
(by ERs) is consistent by means of their order of inhibition efficacy.
The idea of the development of defensive layers by ERH and ERBr was
further supported as a result of the presence of elemental peaks for
halogens (Cl and Br) in their respective EDS spectra.

steel after 12 h of immersion in 1 M
HCl solution: without inhibitor (a) and with 10–3 M of ERH (b) and ERBr (c), respectively.

3.3 Adsorption Studies
One of the most significant aspects in the metal–inhibitor
(ERH/ERBr) interaction is the adsorption isotherm measurement that
provides nature as well as the effectiveness of the interactions.
Among the numerous employed isotherm models, Langmuir adsorption isotherm
(LAI) is utilized most frequently.33 The
LAI can be presented as5 5  where Cinh denotes
the inhibitor (ERs) concentration, Kads is the equilibrium constant, and θ is the surface coverage.
Obviously, a high metal–inhibitor interaction is consistent
with a high value of Kads and a low value
of ΔGads. A graph between Cinh and Cinh/θ
(LAI) yielded a straight line by means of intercept of Kads as presented in Figure SI 3. Employing Kads, values of Gibb’s
free energy (ΔGads) for the WE and
ER interaction are derived using634 6  

The calculated thermodynamic indices
(Kads and ΔGads) are presented in Table SI 2. The inspection of the results showed that the values of Kads are reasonably high (M ×
106) for both ERH and ERBr, which is a measure of their
strong interactions with metallic substrates. Moreover, the values
of ΔGads for ERH and ERBr are greater
than −40 kJ/mol, which indicates that ERH and ERBr adsorb on
the WE surface using the chemisorption mechanism.35 Furthermore, the negative value of ΔGads is higher for ERBr (−42.03 kJ/mol) compared
to ERH (−40.74 kJ/mol), which supports our previous judgment
that ERBr is a more effective corrosion inhibitor than ERH.

3.4 Effect of Temperature
The consequence
of temperature lying on the anticorrosive performance of ERBr at its
best possible (10–3 M) concentration was evaluated
all the way through performing the PDP study at different temperatures
(298–328 K), and consequences so obtained are presented in Figure 8 and Table 3. An increase in the temperature
causes an appreciable drop in the protectiveness of both ERH and ERBr.
This may perhaps be the result of the desorption of adsorbed ER molecules
from the surface at elevated temperatures. Moreover, this type of
reduction in the protectiveness of inhibitors at elevated temperatures
may also result due to acid-catalyzed decomposition, fragmentation,
and/or rearrangement.36 Arrhenius and transition
state equations can be best used to demonstrate the effect of temperature
on the protectiveness of the ERH and ERBr37,38 7   8

In the transition state and Arrhenius equations, all
physical symbols
have their usual meaning. The transition state and Arrhenius plots
for WE’s corrosion in 1 M HCl are presented in Figure SI 4. The values of activation energies
(Ea) were derived for inhibited (by ERBr)
and uninhibited cases using Arrhenius plots, and it was observed that
the Ea value for the inhibited case was
much higher (84.16 kJ/mol) than the uninhibited case (41.94 kJ/mol).
This observation suggests that WE’s corrosion becomes much
difficult in the presence of ERBr because of its adsorption on the
metallic surface that leads to the formation of a protective barrier
for WE corrosion. The increase in the value of Ea was consistent with the corresponding decrease in the corrosion
rate.39 Apart from the above, the positive
sign of ΔHa reflects the endothermic
corrosion, and the negative sign of the ΔSa value for ERBr implies that the activated complex rate-determining
step is dissociative in nature and has a more ordered structure, which
leads to a decrease in ΔSa.40

4 Theoretical Study
4.1 DFT Study
Figure 9 represents the fully optimized molecular
structures of protonated and neutral ERH and ERBr (B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
in the aqueous solvated phase. The most relevant bond lengths (Å),
bond angles (deg), and torsion angles (deg) derived for both forms
of ERH and ERBr are tabulated in Table 4. It can be seen that all of the C–C bond lengths
in the intermediate region of ERH and ERBr are in between 1.390 and
1.410 Å, indicating the participation of these parts in resonance.
It can be further seen that C2–O31 and C5–O26 bonds
are ranged in between 1.372 and 1.380 Å, respectively, which
is shorter than the normal C–O bond present in ethers. The
bond angle values are closer to 120°, indicating sp2 hybridization among those atoms. The values of the torsion angles
derived for ERH and ERBs suggest that their geometries are nearly
planar that offer them an ideal situation to adsorb or interact strongly
on the metallic surface.

Frontier molecular orbitals, FMO (HOMO and LUMO) energies
(EHOMO and ELUMO),
and electron distributions are considered two most significant outcomes
of the DFT study that can be used to correlate the reactivity of any
molecule (inhibitor) with a suitable reagent (metal).41−47 In metal–inhibitor binding, EHOMO and ELUMO are, respectively, associated
with electron-donating and electron-accepting tendency of the inhibitor
molecule. Figures 9 and 10 depict the optimized structures, FMOs,
electrostatic potential map, and contour plots at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
level of theory in the aqueous phase for both forms of ERH and ERBr.
It can be seen that the HOMO and LUMO are distributed over the large
area of ER molecules, which are responsible for their high protectiveness.
Moreover, for ERH, the HOMO and LUMO are mainly located over the ethereal
oxygen and two aromatic rings, indicating that these moieties largely
participate in electron donation as well as electron acceptation.
On the other hand, in ERBr, the HOMO and LUMO are also distributed
over the oxirane (epoxide) moiety along with ethereal oxygen and two
aromatic rings. The greater contribution of the HOMO and LUMO in ERBr
forced it to behave as a better corrosion inhibitor than ERH. The
high contribution of ERBr in electron sharing might be attributed
to the presence of four additional bromine atoms that can enhance
the electron density over aromatic rings and adjacent moieties (epoxide
ring). Large contribution of the HOMO in ERH and ERBr indicates that
they both have a strong ability to transfer their electrons in metallic
d-orbitals. Similarly, the large contribution of the LUMO for both
studied inhibitors indicates that they also have a strong ability
to accept electrons from metallic d-orbitals to their empty antibonding
molecular orbitals. Therefore, it can be postulated that both ERH
and ERBr act as efficient inhibitors because they can donate as well
as accept electrons during their interactions with metals.

FMO energies (EHOMO and ELUMO) along with other numerous
DFT indices derived using
Gaussian 09 are depicted in Table 5.48 DFT indices are calculated
using the relationship reported elsewhere.41−44 The inspection of results showed
that the values of EHOMO for the neutral
form of ERH and ERBr do not show any predicted trend; however, protonated
forms of ERBr are greater than the EHOMO value of protonated ERH, indicating that ERBr is a better electron
donor compared to the ERH.49 This finding
also suggests that the protonated (cationic) form of the inhibitors
(ERs) exert greater contribution toward metallic corrosion inhibition
than their neutral form. The observation of the results showed that
the ELUMO values for neutral as well as
cationic ERBr are lower (more negative) than the ELUMOs of the corresponding ERH, indicating that ERBr acts
as a better electron acceptor during metal–inhibitor bonding
than ERH.50 The energy gap (ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO) displays the
reactivity of the inhibitors against the metal surface51−54 and its smaller indicates high chemical reactivity.41−44,55,56 In the present study, ΔE values for ERH and
ERBr do not show any predicted trend.57−59 However, the higher
value of the dipole moment for ERBr in its neutral form indicates
that it has a greater ability to undergo polarization upon its contact
with the metallic surface, thereby covering a larger surface area,
and behaves as a better corrosion inhibitor than ERH.60,61 This trend of dipole moment well corroborates the results of experimental
methods. The lower value of the hardness (η) is associated with high inhibition effectiveness.62 Inspection of Table 5 indicates that the global absolute hardness of the ERH inhibitor
in both forms (neutral and protonated) in the aqueous phase is found
to be lower than that of the ERBr species.63 A similar trend was observed for other DFT parameters, including
electronegativity and softness. The fractions of electron transfer
(ΔN) were calculated using the Pearson method,64eq 9, and the results obtained are also listed in Table 5. 9  For Fe, the theoretical value of ϕFe for the Fe(110) plane and ηFe are 4.82 and 0 eV, respectively.64,65 The electron flow will occur from the molecule to the metal surface
if ΔN > 0 and vice versa if ΔN < 0.41−44,66,67 Previous studies41−44,68,69 reported that if ΔN < 3.6, the inhibition
efficiency increases with the increasing electron-donating capability
of the inhibitor at the metallic surface. In the present study, the
work function of iron was used to calculate ΔN for both inhibitors. The positive and less than 3.6 ΔN values indicate that both ERH and ERBr have the ability
to interact with the metallic surface by transferring their electrons
into the d-orbital of the metallic atoms. Although, ERH has a slightly
greater electron transfer magnitude, however, it is not much greater
than ERBr. Initially, the molecule–metal interaction energy
(Δψ) was introduced by Kokalj et al.70 The trend of Δψ and ΔEBack-donation was also found to be not satisfying
the experimental trend of inhibition efficiency.

Fukui functions (FFs) was used to analyze the reactive
sites of
ERH and ERBr. The natural population analysis (NPA) as implemented
in G098 was adopted to calculate the FFs.
All natural bond orbital single point calculations for neutral, cationic,
and anionic species were performed using the geometrical structures
of the studied inhibitors at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.
More detailed information regarding instrumentation and better understanding
of FFs can be found elsewhere.71 The sites for nucleophilic (fk+) and electrophilic (fk–) attacks can be evaluated in terms of the electronic populations
as follows 10   11  where qk(N +1), qk(N), and qk(N – 1) are the net charges of the
atom k in ERH and ERBr with N +
1, N and N – 1 electrons,
respectively. The sites where fk+ is located are
responsible for the nucleophilic attack, whereas the sites where mainly fk– is located is responsible for the electrophilic
attack.72,73 Recently, Toro-Labbé and co-workers74 introduced another descriptor, which is a second-order
FF, also called as the “dual descriptor”. Similar to
Woodward–Hofmann rules,75 this parameter
is used to give a simple and instinctive way to chemical reactivity
(eq 12) 12  It was pointed out that75 the situation f2(r) > 0 corresponds to electron acceptor regions and the situation f2(r) < 0 corresponds to
electron donor regions. For better metal–inhibitor interactions,
both the regions should be aligned together. The local softness is
defined as the product of the global softness and the condensed FFs,
as 13  

The local reactivity of the ERH and
ERBr and their protonated forms
ERH-H+ and ERB-H+ were examined by means of
FI values to determine the sites responsible for electrophilic and/or
nucleophilic attacks.76,77 The high value of fk+ and the low value of fk– is associated
with high nucleophilic attacks, whereas the converse is true for electrophilic
attacks. It can be observed that for ERH, C(3), C(6), C(4), and C(1)
atoms of one benzene ring and (C25), C(21), C(22), and C(23) of the
second benzene ring are responsible for nucleophilic attacks, as these
centers possess the highest value of fk+. Conversely, C(5) and C(2) of the first aromatic ring and C(20)
and C(27) of the second benzene ring are responsible for electrophilic
attacks. The oxygen atoms O(30) and O(32) are the most susceptible
sites for electrophilic attacks as they possess the highest value
of fk–. Based on the calculated values
of the second-order Fukui function f2(r) (Table 6 and Figure 11),
in ERH, C(3), C(6), C(4), C(1), and C(11) atoms and their corresponding
atoms are the highest electron acceptor atoms, whereas C(5), C(2),
O(30), and O(40) are the highest electron donors. The computed atomic
charges using natural population analysis of the ERH inhibitor are
given in Table SI 4 of the Supporting Information.

For ERBr, four hydrogen atoms at C(1), C(3), C(21),
and C(23) have
been replaced by four bromine atoms. Table 6 shows that the C(4), C(20), (C1), (C21),
C(6), and C(19) of the two aromatic benzene rings, along with Br(29)
and Br(31) possess the highest value of fk+, and consequently, they are responsible for the nucleophilic attack.
In contrast, Br(28) and Br(30) atoms along with the other carbon atoms
of the two benzene rings, C(2), C(25), C(5), and C(18), are the most
exposed sites for the electrophilic attack as they possess the highest
value of fk–. According to the obtained
results of the second-order FF (f2(r)) (Table 6 and Figure 11) for
ERBr inhibitor C(4), C(20), C(19), C(6), C(23), and C(3) atoms are
the highest electron acceptor atoms, whereas C(25), C(2), C(18), C(5),
O(26), and O(27) are the highest electron donors. The computed atomic
charges using natural population analysis of the ERBr inhibitor are
given in Table SI 5 of the Supporting Information.
Based on the above discussion, it can be deduced that the studied
inhibitors have many active sites for adsorption on the mild steel
surface. The most active sites are those carbon atoms of the two benzene
rings, along with oxygen atoms of epoxide rings and Br atoms.

4.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Orientation
neutral and protonated forms of ERH and ERBr on Fe(110) are shown
in Figure 12. Both
ERH and ERBr adsorb on the Fe(110) surface effectively using flat
or nearly flat orientations. The adsorption of ERs is greatly assisted
by oxygen and bromine atoms along with the aromatic rings. The energies
for ERs on Fe(110) surface adsorption were calculated using the following
relation 14  where Etotal is
the total energy of the system resulting through metal–ER interactions
and Esurf+water and Einh+water represent the potential energies of the system
without and with ERH and ERBr, respectively. For better approximation
and reproducibility of the data, average adsorption energies (Eads) were computed for ERs after gaining their
most stable (lowest energy) equilibrium configuration. The Eads values for the adsorption of ERH, ERH-H+, ERBr, and ERBr-H+ on Fe(110) were −255.5,
−702.1, −499.4, and −745.8 kJ/mol, respectively.
The negative sign of Eads suggests the
spontaneous adsorption/interaction between WE and ERs. The higher
negative value of Eads for ERBr-H+ than ERH-H+ indicates that ERBr-H+ has
a greater ability to interact with the metallic surface and adsorb
more strongly compared to ERH-H+. This observation fully
corroborates our earlier findings derived through EIS, dissipative
particle dynamics, SEM-energy dispersive X-ray, and DFT analyses that ERBr acts as a
better corrosion inhibitor than ERH. Moreover, higher values of Eads for protonated (cationic) ERH and ERBr compared
to their neutral forms suggested that the cationic form has a greater
contribution in corrosion inhibition than neutral forms.

It can be seen that these types of compounds acted
as good corrosion
inhibitors and their compounds contain two aromatic rings and heteroatoms
(N, O, S, and P).

6 Conclusions
In the present study, two
macromolecular aromatic epoxy resins
(ERs) are evaluated as corrosion inhibitors for the carbon steel/1
M HCl system. Outcomes of the study revealed that ERs act the same
as good corrosion inhibitors and their effectiveness enhances by the
way of concentration. ERH and ERBr exhibited the highest inhibition
efficiencies of 95.6 and 96.5% at as low as 10–3 M concentration. ERH behaves as a predominantly anodic type, whereas
ERBr acts as a cathodic type of corrosion inhibitor. The EIS study
revealed that ERH and ERBr form inhibitive films at metal–electrolyte
interfaces. The adsorption of the macromolecules obeyed the Langmuir
adsorption isotherm model. Thermodynamic studies showed that ERs adsorb
spontaneously using their chemisorption mechanism. DFT measurement
showed that in ERH, it is the aromatic rings that mainly participate
in donor–accepter interactions with a very slight contribution
from the epoxide rings; however, in ERBr, almost the entire part of
the molecules participates in the donor–acceptor interaction.
MD simulations suggested that ERs strongly and flatly get adsorbed
on the surface aromatic and epoxide rings and bromine atoms (in ERBr).
One of the most significant outcomes of the computational analyses
is that it is the protonated form of ERH and ERBr that mainly involves
in metal–inhibitor interactions.
