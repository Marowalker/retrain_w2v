A strategy of dynamic
covalent chemistry within constrained biaryls
was developed for the modulation of axial chirality. The ring fusion
partners of amide and aldehyde allowed the manipulation of ring/chain
equilibrium and chirality transfer within cyclic diastereomeric hemiaminal.
Dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) with alcohols, thiols, and secondary
amines further enabled the reversal of chirality relay and thereby
regulation of axial chirality. Moreover, a combination of NMR, X-ray,
and density functional theory results shed light on the structural
basis of chirality transfer, exhibiting modest to excellent diastereoselectivity
under thermodynamic control. The critical role of the amide unit in
the modulation of axial chirality was also corroborated. Finally,
the chiroptical signal was controlled through changing solvents, DCRs,
and stimuli-responsive switching of DCRs.

1 Introduction
Atropisomers and associated axial chirality play notable roles
in a variety of areas, such as asymmetric synthesis,1 drug discovery,2 and organic
materials.3 As a result, the construction,
regulation, and functionalization of atropisomers are attracting unabated
attention. In particular, the switch of axial chirality could be appealing
to endeavors of controllable catalysis,4 intelligent assemblies,5 and chiroptical
materials.6 The movement of atropisomerization
equilibrium within diastereomeric structures contributes to the increasingly
popular methodology of dynamic kinetic resolution of biaryls.7 The modulation of axial chirality is also of
vital importance for the creation of molecular switches and machines.8 Furthermore, atropisomers have been employed
for the generation of supramolecular chirality.9 Hence, the development of new platforms and mechanisms
for the control of atropisomers should be highly desired.

The
communication between chiral building blocks, and the ensuing
interconversion between stereoisomers triggered by the introduction
or removal of external stimulus could afford chirality switches.10 For example, pH-sensitive chiroptical switches
were mediated by hydrogen bonding within binaphthyl–bipyridyl
cyclic dyads.11 A light-driven halogen-bonded
axially chiral switch was reported for supramolecular assembly.12 Circular dichroism (CD) photoswitching was recently
accomplished using atropisomerical hemiindigo.13 Although elegant, the switching of axial chirality through
the blossoming tool of dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC)14 is rare. Formation and exchange of reversible
covalent bonds can create addressable diversity and complexity.15 The interconversion within dynamic covalent
systems can further lead to switchable states.16 In this work, the ring fusion DCC partners of amide and
aldehyde within atropisomeric biaryls were manipulated for the modulation
of axial chirality (Figure 1). Stimuli-responsive control of chiroptical signal was further
achieved.

biaryls for the control of axial chirality within cyclic diastereomers.

2 Results and Discussion
We envision that a marriage of atropisomerism and ring-chain tautomerism
could offer us a versatile system for harnessing axial chirality (Figure 1). The tunable acidity
and rigid planar configuration of the amide at position 2 of biaryl
would regulate the equilibrium of its intramolecular dynamic covalent
reaction (DCR) with the aldehyde at position 2′ (1 and 2). More importantly, the central chirality of
the latent hemiaminal stereocenter (marked with a star in Figure 1) would influence
the axially chiral biaryl through central-to-axial asymmetric induction
within cyclic diastereomeric hemiaminal. Such a chirality relay would
then be modulated by intermolecular DCRs, as the varying steric effect
dictated by incorporated nucleophiles could perturb atropisomerization
equilibrium. Due to the dynamic nature of DCRs, the interconversion
within the complex system could also be controlled with an external
stimulus.

With the strategy in place, 2-carboxamide-2′-formylbiphenyl
(2a and 2b) was synthesized (Figure 2a and Scheme S1). To gauge the role of the amide, 2c, with
a tetrahedral sulfonamide instead of the planar amide of 2a, was selected as a control.17a The cyclic
hemiaminal form dominated for 2a and 2b in
acetonitrile, with only a residual amount of aldehyde (Figure 2b). To validate the extent
of ring/chain isomerization, the aldehyde and its lactam were equilibrated
at 60 °C and analyzed (Figures S2 and S4). The preference of ring form is maintained for 2a and 2b though the ratio of ring/chain isomers varies from rt to
60 °C. Differently, the open aldehyde was favored for 2c (Figure S5). The reversal of ring/chain
equilibrium from amide to sulfonamide is consistent with the stronger
acidity of the latter.

Figure 2 (a) Structures of biaryls studied. (b) 1H-NMR
spectra
of 2a in CD3CN at rt and 60 °C. (c) Crystal
structure of 2a, with both enantiomers shown. Density
functional theory (DFT) calculation of two diastereomers of 2a (d) and 2c (e), their transition states (3a and 3c), and associated conversion barrier
(in kcal/mol).

Attention was then turned
to chirality transfer. One stereocenter
(i.e., hemiaminal carbon) and one chiral axis will give two enantiomeric
sets of diastereomers (Figure S6), and
the selectivity of chirality induction will be reflected by the diastereomeric
ratio (d.r.). Indeed, two sets of NMR peaks were apparent for 2a (see Ha, Hb, and Hc in Figure 2b), with a d.r. around
1.6. A d.r. value of 1.4 was obtained for 2b. Although
the biaryl could adopt M or P helicity,
the newly created hemiaminal stereocenter leads to an energy difference
between two diastereomeric sets (R, P)/(S, M) and (R, M)/(S, P), resulting
in a shift of the atropisomerization equilibrium (Figures 1 and S6).

Our next step was to elucidate the structural basis governing
the
chirality induction. In the crystal structure of 2a,
(R, P)/(S, M) was observed (Figure 2c). Torsion angles of 41 and 35° were adopted
for the biphenyl motif and the benzamide fragment (phenyl and its
attached amide plane), respectively. Furthermore, the two substituents
on the hemiaminal carbon are placed to minimize electrostatic repulsion:
hydroxyl away from the benzamide ring, accounting for the diastereoselectivity.
(R, P)/(S, M) of 2a were also confirmed as the major diastereomeric
set over (R, M)/(S, P) through DFT calculation, with a conversion
barrier of 24.0 kcal/mol (3a, the transition state between
diastereomers of 2a in Figure 2d). Such a barrier for atropisomerization
is also in line with the existence of two sets of diastereomers for
the ring form at rt (i.e., slow interconversion at NMR time scale).

By contrast, there is only one set of NMR peaks for 2c at rt. This was supported by a calculated atropisomerization barrier
of 16.7 kcal/mol (3c, the transition state between diastereomers
of 2c in Figure 2e), which indicates a relatively fast inversion and thus the
fluxionality of the ring structure. The significant gap between the
barrier of 3a and 3c can be attributed to
the variation of configurational rigidity between amide and sulfonamide.
Furthermore, a more stable diastereomeric set of (R, M)/(S, P) was
found for 2c, again different from 2a. The
reversal of chirality relay from 2a to 2c was rationalized with the repulsion between lone pairs of oxygen
atoms of the sulfonamide and the hydroxyl group. We believe that such
a thermodynamic effect is also in consequence of the distinct configuration
of sulfonamide and amide, respectively.

Having identified structural
foundation dictating intramolecular
DCRs and associated axial chirality, we next set out to control it
with intermolecular DCRs (Figure 3). Through manipulating dual reactivity17b of equilibrating ring/open forms of 2 (Figure 3a), reversible
bonding of a series of alcohols, thiols, and amines was realized (Figures S8–S48). For primary amines, the
reaction with aldehyde gave a mixture of imine (4) and
its cyclic aminal (5). Aminal (6) was afforded
for DCRs with secondary amines, likely via an iminium ion (7). For alcohols and thiols, the reaction can proceed through a cyclic
acyliminium ion (8) in the presence of methanesulfonic
acid (MA), and cyclic hemiaminal ether (9) and thioether
(10) was obtained, respectively. The reversibility of
the reaction was confirmed through dynamic component exchange (Figures S45–S48).

Figure 3 (a) DCRs of 2 with amines, alcohols, and thiols, as
well as potential intermediates. (b) Partial 1H NMR spectra

(II), and 2-propanol (III), as well as the disassociation of in situ,
created 9a with water (IV). (c) X-ray structures of 2a, 9a, 10a, and 6a. (d) DCR induced reversal of atropisomerization equilibrium based
on DFT calculation.

The diastereoselectivity
of cyclic adducts (6, 9, and 10) was explored further for chirality
induction (Table 1).
The reaction of 2a and 2-propanol gave only a modest
d.r. of 1.4 (Table 1 and Figure 3b). Significantly
improved stereoselectivity was found for 10a from 2-propanethiol
(d.r. 9.4, Figure 3b). Furthermore, only one set of diastereomers was apparent for DCR
of 2a with bulkier secondary amines, such as piperidine
(Figure 3b), suggesting
nearly perfect chirality transfer (d.r. > 20). In addition, 2b afforded larger d.r. values than 2a (Table 1). In general, a similar
trend of d.r. (secondary amine > thiol > alcohol) was observed
(Table 1).

Table 1 Values of d.r. for the Reactions of 2a or 2b with Nucleophiles (Calculated from 1H-NMR Spectra)
Intrigued by
the enhancement of diastereoselectivity with increased
sterics, we were wondering the consequence of chirality transfer within
adducts. The helicity of biphenyl is switched from P (2a) to M (9a) with an R configuration for the hemiaminal ether carbon according
to X-ray structures (Figures 3c and S49). Analogous (R, M)/(S, P) structures were obtained with 10a (from 2-propanethiol).
Moreover, the relative configuration (R or S) is different between 6a and 9a/10a due to nomenclature issue, but the position of
the hydrogen atom and attached nucleophile on the methine carbon remains
intact (Figure 3c).
The reversal of atropisomerization equilibrium was further supported
with DFT computation of 6a, 9a, and 10a, as a free energy difference of 3.50, 0.20, and 1.40 kcal/mol
between two diastereomeric sets was unraveled, respectively (Figures 3d and S50).

The reversal of chirality induction
between 2a and
its adducts was explained as follows. To accommodate the incorporation
of nucleophiles and thus increased sterics, the unfavorable electrostatic
interaction between the incorporated nucleophile and benzamide would
be compromised, leading to the stabilization of (R, M)/(S, P) over
(R, P)/(S, M) (Figure 3d). We thereby concluded that the regulation of axial chirality within
our dynamic system is thermodynamically, but not kinetically controlled,
despite that the barrier of atropisomerization for cyclic adducts
can be high, as shown by DFT calculation (28.2, 26.5, and 31.6 kcal/mol
for 6a, 9a, and 10a, respectively, Figure S50) in conjunction with VT-NMR (Figure S52). Moreover, the addition of D2O allowed the dissociation of 9a to recover 2a and further validate the dynamic nature of the process
(Figures 3b and S53). For control 2c, the relationship
of chirality transfer is maintained in its DCRs with nucleophiles
(Figures S55).

The next goal was
to engineering the CD signal toward a potential
chiroptical switch.18 Because aldehydes 1 are racemic, a chiral amine, R-1-phenylethylamine,
was attached to the biaryl (11) to impose a chiral bias
(Figure 4a and Scheme S2). In CD3CN, the cyclic hemiaminal
accounted for only 12% of the population, with modest diastereoselectivity
(d.r. 1.3). In sharp contrast, the ring form was overwhelming in CDCl3, and a single diastereomer was nearly obtained (d.r. 16, Figure 4a). DFT calculation
of four diastereomers, (R, S, M), (R, S, P), (R, R, M),
and (R, R, P),
revealed the significant contribution of only two ((R, S, P) and (R, R, M)), thereby supporting two sets of resonances
in NMR (Figures 4b
and S107). X-ray structure of 11 supports the existence of a diastereomer (R, R, M) (Figures 4b and S59). The
central-to-axial chirality transfer is reversed from 2a ((R, P) and (S, M)) to 11 ((R, M) and (S, P)), which
results from the unfavorable steric interaction between bulky 1-phenylethylamine
and hydroxyl, hence echoing the regulation of axial chirality through
varying sterics.

(c) CD spectra of 11 in CH3CN or CDCl3. (d) CD spectra of the DCR of 11 (0.10 mM) with

Finally, CD spectra were measured
to transduce chirality relay
into chiroptical outputs. Gratifyingly, strong positive Cotton effect
around 260 nm was observed for 11 in CHCl3 (Figure 4c). However,
only a weak signal was found in CH3CN. Upon DCRs with 2-propanol,
2-propanethiol, or piperidine in CH3CN, the magnitude of
CD spectra was amplified (12–14, Figure 4d) and also consistent
with the trend of d.r. values of corresponding assemblies (Figures S60–S62). For example, the adduct
of 11 and piperidine gave a negative Cotton effect at
270 nm. With the addition of acid MA, the signal was suppressed, as
the protonation of amine resulted in the reversal of the DCR (Figures 4e, S63 and S64). The use of Et3N enabled the recovery
of the assembly and thus CD spectra. In a similar way, turning on/off
of CD signal was achieved through redox-controlled switching of DCR
of 11 and thiol (Figures S65 and S66). Tying it all together, the chiroptical signal can be
facilely regulated through a variety of means, including changing
solvents, DCRs, and the switching of DCRs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a dynamic covalent chemistry constrained biaryl platform
was developed for the regulation of axial chirality. 2-Carboxyamide-2′-formylbiaryl
derivatives allowed the modulation of the equilibrium between open
aldehyde and its cyclic hemiaminal. Moreover, the extent and structural
basis of central-to-axial chirality transfer were elucidated. Through
reversible covalent bonding of alcohols, thiols, and secondary amines,
the reversal of chirality relay and thus modulation of axial chirality
was further accomplished. Finally, by introducing a chiral bias stimuli-responsive
control of the chiroptical signal was readily achieved. The strategies
and results reported should be intriguing to future studies of asymmetric
catalysis, molecular switches, and intelligent materials.

from Aldrich. All other reagents were obtained from commercial sources
and were used without further purification unless indicated otherwise.

4.2 General Methods
NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Biospin avance III spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C). The chemical shifts (δ)
for 1H NMR spectra, given in ppm, are referenced to the
residual proton signal of the deuterated solvent. Mass spectra were

4.4 Dynamic Covalent Reactions
(DCRs)
DCRs were performed in situ in CD3CN without
isolation
and purification. To a stirred solution of 2 (∼25
mM, 1.0 equiv) in CD3CN (0.60 mL) were added one mononucleophile
(ROH (3.0 equiv), RSH (3.0 equiv), R1R2NH (3.0
equiv), or RNH2 (1.2 equiv)), and activated 3 Å molecular
sieves (MS, 4–8 mesh). For ROH and RSH, methanesulfonic acid
(MA, 1.0 equiv) was also added. The mixture was stirred for 20 h and
characterized by 1H NMR and electrospray ionization mass
spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C after the solutions
of DCRs of 11 with different nucleophiles were diluted
with acetonitrile. See specific conditions in figure captions of the
main text or the Supporting Information if necessary.

4.5 DFT Calculations
All calculations
were performed using Gaussian 09 packages.19 Geometry optimization and the calculation of single point energy
were run using the density functional theory method (M06-2X) with
the basis set of 6-31G** and 6-311++G**, respectively.
A solvent model for acetonitrile (polar continuum model) was used.
Minima were confirmed by vibration calculations without imaginary
vibrational frequencies. The conformational search was conducted for 2a, 2c, 6a, 9a, 10a, 10c, and 11, and the most stable
conformer of each diastereomeric set was then calculated and listed.
The transition state for the atropisomerization of 2a, 2c, 6a, 9a, and 10a was calculated and validated with only one imaginary vibration.
