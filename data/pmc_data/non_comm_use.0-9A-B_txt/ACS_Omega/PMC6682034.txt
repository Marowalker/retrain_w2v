Keeping in view various
pharmacological attributes of curcumin, coumarin, and isatin derivatives,
triazole-tethered monocarbonyl curcumin–coumarin and curcumin–isatin
molecular hybrids have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial
potential against Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) human pathogenic bacterial strains.
Among all hybrid molecules, A-4 and B-38 showed the most potent antibacterial activity with inhibition zones
of 29 and 31 mm along with MIC values of 12.50 and 6.25 μg/mL,
respectively. Structure–activity relationship that emerged
from biological data revealed that the two-carbon alkyl chain between
triazole and coumarin/isatin moiety is well tolerable for the activity.
Bromo substitution at the fifth position of isatin, para-cholo substitution
in the case of curcumin–isatin, and para-methoxy in the case
of curcumin–coumarin hybrids on ring A of curcumin are most
suitable groups for the antibacterial activity. Various types of binding
interactions of A-4 and B-38 within the
active site of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of S.
aureus are also streamlined by molecular modeling
studies, suggesting their capability in completely blocking DHFR.

Introduction
Microbial resistance
has prominently emerged as a serious threat to human health within
the last few decades and becomes the most difficult and serious challenge
to healthcare experts and researchers across the globe. Surveillance
data of the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that approximately
50,000 people across the globe including male, female, and children
are dying every day due to microbial infections in both high- and
low-income countries.1 A report released
by WHO states that 16 million people died in 1990 due to microbial
infections; the figure reduced to 15 million in 2010 and is expected
to be 13 million in 2050, suggesting that the mortality rate due to
microbial infections is declining but very slowly, which may be due
to the sudden increase in population as well as microbial resistance.2 Recent efforts in the development of antimicrobial
agents were incapable of meeting expectations due to microbial resistance
and inadequate antimicrobial activity accompanied with toxicity, which
suggests that more rigorous efforts in the search of novel antimicrobial
agents are needed.3 In the last few years,
various research strategies have been successfully utilized to tackle
the multidrug-resistant microbial infection. Numerous studies suggested
that drug resistance is more prevalent in solo targeting agents, which
is the major reason for the failure of expected drug candidate.4 Drugs targeting more than a single target or
multiple sites of a single target exhibited higher potency, minimum
resistance, and lesser toxicity as compared to solo targeting agents.5−8 Molecular hybridization technique is dedicated to the development
of such multitargeting agents.

In molecular hybridization approach,
two different active pharmacophores are combined together with or
without the help of a linker to get the desired hybrid.9 In 2006, FDA approved vorinostat, a potent histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC inhibitor) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
treatment. CUDC-907, a hybrid molecule of vorinostat and GDC-0941
(a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor), is more efficient
against cancer in both in vitro and in vivo models without showing
any systemic toxicity and resistance. This dual HDAC/PI3K inhibitor
has recently passed the phase I trial for advanced solid tumor, lymphoma,
or multiple myeloma treatment and entered phase II trials.10 Thus, hybrid molecules can lower the risk of
multiple drug resistance along with drug–drug interactions,
which could be very beneficial for humanity in confronting microbial
resistance.

Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound and major constituent
of Curcuma longa L., is well known
for its countless biological activities including antioxidant, neuroprotective,
anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antimicrobial activities.11,12 Besides its potent biological activities, curcumin suffers from
pharmacokinetic issues such as low solubility, poor absorption, and
lower bioavailability along with instant metabolism in the human body
that limits its clinical use. The α,β-unsaturated β-diketone
moiety of curcumin undergoes keto–enol tautomerism, forming
a hydrogen bond containing a six-membered ring. The six-membered ring
so formed is a potential substrate for the aldoketo reductase enzyme
in the human body, resulting in its rapid metabolism. The monocarbonyl architecture of curcumin has been developed by
eliminating its sensitive β-diketone moiety (responsible for
its pharmacokinetic limitations) via several modifications in its
parent structure to elevate its stability as well as bioavailability.
Some recently designed monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin (1–3) displayed potent antimicrobial activity with
improved solubility and stability13 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 (a) Rational architecture
of monocarbonyl curcumin. (b) Monocarbonyl curcumin analogs emerged
as potent antibacterial agents with improved stability and potent
antimicrobial activity (1–3).

Isatin is an indole derivative
and pharmacologically active nucleus with a wide range of biological
applications. It is widely distributed in a number of natural products
including fungal metabolites as well as plant and marine natural products
especially alkaloids. Numerous reports have been available, describing
the antimicrobial potential of isatin-based hybrids including propylene-tethered
ciprofloxacin–isatin hybrids (4) and indole–isatin
hybrids (5).14,15

Coumarin is well
known for its wide range of biological activities.16−20 The promising antimicrobial potential of coumarin-based
hybrid molecules such as coumarin–theophylline hybrids (6), coumarin–thiazolyl hybrids (7), coumarin–sulfonamide
hybrids (8), and coumarin–imidazole hybrids (9) has been widely reported by numerous researchers18,21−27 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Recently reported
various hybrid molecules as antimicrobial agents containing isatin
(4 and 5) and coumarin (6–9) nuclei.

Triazole is a vital heterocyclic
moiety that plays a significant role in medicinal chemistry and has
been employed in architecting various biologically active molecules
including antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory,
and anticonvulsant.14,15,28−36 This elite moiety has been successfully incorporated in various
molecules that exhibit admirable antimicrobial profile.35−40 Due to the excellent profile of this moiety in the antimicrobial
area, it has been selected to incorporate into targeted hybrid molecules
as a linker to join curcumin–coumarin and curcumin–isatin.

Considering the global health issue of antimicrobial resistance
as a major limitation of currently available antimicrobial drugs and
emergency need of novel potent antimicrobial agents, the present study
targets the synthesis and characterization of triazole-tethered monocarbonyl
curcumin–isatin and curcumin–coumarin hybrids by using
the click chemistry approach (Figure 3) along with their evaluations against various bacterial
strains. The zones of inhibition of all synthesized compounds were
determined, and the minimum inhibitory concentration values of potent
compounds were calculated. Furthermore, various binding interactions
of potent compounds were explored by using molecular modeling studies.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of targeted hybrid molecules was carried out via a series of chemical
reactions (Scheme 1), initiating to form vanillin. Vanillin was reacted with acetone
in the presence of 40% KOH at 25 °C to form vinyldenacetone (VA),
characterized by two doublets at 6.5 and 7.5 ppm with a J value higher than 16 Hz in 1H NMR, designating two doublets
for each proton. The obtained VA was then reacted with propargyl bromide
in K2CO3 at 25 °C in DMF as a solvent to
get propargylated vinyldenacetone (PVA), which was characterized by
identifying singlets, one at 2.5 for one proton and another at 4.8
for two protons in 1H NMR. Various substituted aldehydes
were reacted with PVA in the presence of 5% NaOH at 25 °C in
methanol as a solvent to get various propargylated analogs of monocarbonyl
curcumin.

On
the other hand, various 1,2-dibromoalkanes were treated with 4-hydroxy
coumarin in the presence of K2CO3 at 25 °C
in DMF as a solvent to get the desired products (4-(2-bromoalkoxy)-2H-chromen-2-ones),
which were further treated with NaN3 at 25 °C in DMF
to get 4-(2-azidoalkoxy)-2H-chromen-2-ones.

Simultaneously,
differently substituted isatins were subjected to treatment with 1,2-dibromoethane
in the presence of K2CO3 at 25 °C in DMF
as a solvent. The obtained crude products were purified using column
chromatography to get N-bromoethyl isatin, which
was further treated with NaN3 at 25 °C in DMF to get N-azidoethyl isatins.

The obtained 4-(2-azidoethoxy)-2H-chromen-2-ones and N-azidoethyl isatins
were treated with various propragylated analogs of monocarbonyl curcumin
in the presence of the catalytic amount of copper sulfate and reducing
agent sodium ascorbate at 25 °C in DMF to yield various triazole-linked
monocarbonyl curcumin–coumarin and curcumin–isatin hybrids.

Antibacterial
Activity
All the synthesized hybrids were evaluated to check
their antibacterial potential against two of both Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus
aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) human pathogenic bacterial strains. Almost all of the synthesized
hybrids were active against the tested bacterial strains (Tables 1 and 2). Among the screened bacterial strains, S.
aureus was the most sensitive one, and E. coli was the most resistant strain to the hybrid
molecules. Compound A-4 from curcumin–coumarin
hybrids and B-38 from curcumin–isatin hybrids
emerged as the most potent hybrids with inhibition zones of 29 and
31 mm against S. aureus, respectively
(Figure 4). From Tables 1 and 2, an interesting structure–activity relationship has
been established for both curcumin–coumarin and curcumin–isatin
hybrid molecules. (Figure 5).

Figure 4 (a) Zone of inhibition (29 mm) shown by hybrid A-4 along with positive control (PC) levofloxacin and negative control

In the case of curcumin–coumarin
hybrids, a methoxy-substituted phenyl ring (ring X) was found to favor
antibacterial potential. Inhibition zones observed for A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, and A-6 against S. aureus were
13, 17, 29, 24, and 22 mm, respectively. This suggests that mono-methoxy
substitution at the para position on the phenyl ring as ring X is
most suitable followed by meta- and ortho-methoxy substitution. As
the number of methoxy substitutions increased around ring X, the activity
decreased. An unsubstituted phenyl ring as ring X (A-1) showed moderate activity with an inhibition zone of 12 mm. Naphthyl
as ring X (A-7) further diminishes the activity (11 mm),
suggesting that polycyclic rings are not suitable for antimicrobial
potential. Ring X as heteroaryl ring-like furan (A-8)
and thiophene (A-9) was not a suitable companion for
antimicrobial potential. Thus, the overall preference order for ring
X is as follows: 4-methoxy phenyl > 3-methoxy phenyl > 2-methoxy
phenyl > 2,3-dimethoxy phenyl > 2,3,4-trimethoxy phenyl >
phenyl > naphthyl > furan = thiophene. Data also revealed that,
with an increment of carbon number in the chain joining triazole and
coumarin, the antibacterial activity decreased, suggesting a preference
order of chain length as n = 2 > 3 > 4 >
5. Thus, the two-carbon chain length joining triazole and coumarin
is a most suitable linker.

Taking lead from the structure–activity
relationship of curcumin–coumarin hybrids, the two-carbon chain
length between triazole and isatin has been employed in curcumin–isatin
hybrids. In curcumin–isatin hybrid molecules, the electronegative
environment around isatin and ring X of monocarbonyl curcumin significantly
affect the antimicrobial activity. Inhibition zones observed for B-38, B-39, B-40, B-41, and B-42 against S. aureus were 31, 28, 21, 12, and 10 mm, respectively, suggesting that para-chloro
substitution on the phenyl ring as ring X was most suitable followed
by para-bromo and meta-bromo substitutions. With more electronegative
substitutions, as in the case of B-41 (para-nitro) and B-42 (meta-nitro), the activity decreased significantly. Inhibition
zones observed for methoxy-substituted compounds, that is, B-30, B-31, B-32, B-33, and B-34, against S. aureus were
8, 9, 12, 10, and 9 mm, respectively, suggesting that para-methoxy
substitution is somewhat found favorable followed by meta-methoxy,
2,3-dimethoxy, and bulky 2,3,4-trimethoxy substitutions but were much
lower as compared to B-38. Therefore, methoxy substitutions
at the phenyl ring as ring X are not the substitutions of choice.
The unsubstituted phenyl ring as ring X (B-29) showed
a much lower inhibition zone of 11 mm that was further lowered when
exchanged with a naphthyl ring (B-35). Ring X as heteroaryl
ring-like furan (B-36) and thiophene (B-37) as in curcumin-isatin hybrids showed a moderate activity with 18
mm inhibition zones. Thus, the overall preference order for ring X
is as follows: 4-chloro phenyl > 4-bromo phenyl > 3-bromo phenyl
> furan = thiophene > 4-methoxy phenyl = 4-nitro phenyl >
phenyl > 3-nitro phenyl = 3-methoxy phenyl > 2-methoxy phenyl
= 2,3-dimethoxy phenyl > 2,3,4-trimethoxy phenyl = naphthyl. The
preference order for substituent R on isatin is as follows: Br >
Cl > H.

MIC values of the most potent hybrid molecules (A-4 and B-38) against S. aureus have been determined by the broth microdilution method. Both A-4 and B-38 possess decent MIC values (12.50
and 6.25 μg/mL, respectively), which were much close to the
levofloxacin (3.12 μg/mL) and better than ciprofloxacin (49
μg/mL) and cefuroxime (98 μg/mL).41

Molecular Modeling Studies
DHFR in S. aureus catalyzes the reduction process of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate
through NADPH, which is therefore important in pathways for production
of intracellular purines (adenine and guanine). Inhibition of DHFR
completely blocks DNA replication in S. aureus, leading to bacterial death. Therefore, DHFR is a validated target
for antibacterial drug development especially against S. aureus. Molecular modeling studies
were performed to elucidate interactions of the most potent compounds
(A-4 and B-38) with the dihydrofolate reductase
enzyme of S. aureus.42 For that purpose, the X-ray crystallographic structure
of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme of S.
aureus, complexed with 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline
(PDB entry: 3SRQ; resolution, 1.69 Å), was employed. The accuracy of the docking
program was validated by docking cocrystallized ligand 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline
in its binding site. The program was able to reproduce best fit confirmation
of 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline with a root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of 0.523, indicating the reliability of the docking protocol.
After that, A-4 and B-38 were individually
docked into the 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline binding site, and their
best poses with −4.3014 and −6.1337 scores having ΔG values of −39 and −30 kJ/mol, respectively,
were selected for discussion (Figure 6).

Å); (b) A-4 docked on the binding site of DHFR;
(c) B-38 docked on the binding site of DHFR; (d) 3D view

of binding site of DHFR; (f) 2D view of interactions of A-4 with residues of binding site of DHFR; (g) 2D view of interactions
of B-38 with residues of binding site of DHFR.

The overall binding mode of A-4 and B-38 with residues of the binding site
suggests that both compounds fit well in the cavity and are well stabilized
by various electrostatic interactions. In the case of A-4, major interactions with DHFR include π–σ, π–alkyl,
carbon–hydrogen bond, π–donor hydrogen bond, and
conventional hydrogen bond interaction. The coumarin moiety is well
positioned in a cavity formed by Ile51, Phe93, Leu55, and Leu29 (hydrophobic
residues) and perfectly sandwiched between the aliphatic side chains
of Leu21, Leu29, Val32, and Ile51, stabilized by π–σ
and π–alkyl interactions. The backbone −NH of
Ala8 shows a H-bond interaction with the nitrogen group present in
the triazole ring (H-bond acceptor; d = 2.843 Å).
The triazole ring is also sandwiched between aliphatic side chains
of Val7 and Leu21, stabilized by π–alkyl interactions.
The curcumin moiety is surrounded by the cavity formed by Thr47, Lys53,
Ser50, Gln20 (polar residues), and Leu21 (hydrophobic residue). Ring
B showed π–σ interaction with Leu21 and π–donor
hydrogen bond interaction with Ser50. The methoxy group on ring A
forms a carbon–hydrogen bond with Lys53. Apart from these interactions’
alkyl carbon, hydrogens around the triazole ring also form carbon–hydrogen
bonds with Asp28 (polar residue) and Phe93 (hydrophobic residue).

B-38 also interacts with DHFR by π–σ,
π–alkyl, carbon–hydrogen bond, π–donor
hydrogen bond, and conventional hydrogen bond interactions just like A-4. The curcumin moiety is well positioned in the cavity
formed by Ala8, Val32, Leu29, Leu55, Phe93, Gly94, Val7, Ile51, Phe99
(hydrophobic residues), Asp28, and Ser50 (polar residues). Ring B
has shown π–alkyl interactions with Val32 and Ala8 as
well as π–donor hydrogen bond interaction with Asp28.
The oxygen of the methoxy group at ring B shows unfavorable acceptor–acceptor
interaction, while hydrogen shows carbon–hydrogen bond interaction
with Asp28. The oxygen of the ether linkage between rings B and C
shows H-bond interaction with the −NH backbone of Ala8 (H-bond
acceptor; d = 2.875 Å). The triazole ring is
well positioned between Leu21, Ile15, Val7, and Ala8, stabilized through
π–alkyl interactions. The isatin moiety is sandwiched
between Thr47, Ser50, and Leu21, stabilized by π–donor
hydrogen bond and π–alkyl interactions. Rings D and E
show π–donor hydrogen bond interaction with Thr47 and
Ser50, respectively, while both rings interact with Leu21 through
π–σ bonds. Hydrogens of alkyl carbons around the
triazole ring interact with Ile15, Phe93, and Leu6 through carbon–hydrogen
bonds. The overall study seems to confirm that both A-4 and B-38 are sufficiently decorated with small, rigid,
and planar groups representing optimum scaffolds that are able to
fulfill the pharmacophoric requirements for S. aureus DHFR inhibition.

Conclusions
In the present study,
triazole-tethered monocarbonyl curcumin–coumarin and curcumin–isatin
molecular hybrids were designed, synthesized, and characterized using 1H and 13C NMR. All synthesized hybrids were assessed
for antibacterial potential against two Gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) and two Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) human pathogenic bacterial
strains. Among all hybrids, A-4 and B-38 emerged as the most potent hybrids with potent antibacterial activity
against all screened strains, with the highest activity against S. aureus. Both A-4 and B-38 showed inhibition zones of 29 and 31 mm with MIC values of 12.50
and 6.25 μg/mL, respectively. Structure–activity relationship
revealed that the two-carbon alkyl chain between triazole and coumarin/isatin
moiety is well tolerable. Bromo substitution on the fifth position
of isatin, para-chloro substitution in the case of curcumin–isatin,
and para-methoxy in the case of curcumin–coumarin hybrids on
ring A of curcumin are most suitable for the antibacterial activity.
Various binding interactions of A-4 and B-38 with the active site of S. aureus DHFR are also streamlined to justify their potential in blocking
DHFR. Thus, the overall study concluded that these hybrid molecules
could act as the hit lead for further development of antibacterial
agents.

Experimental Section
Materials and Measurements
Chemicals
used in the synthesis were procured from CDH, Sigma Aldrich, and Loba,
India. Characterization of synthesized compounds was done by spectroscopic
techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental
analysis. Recording of NMR spectra was done by using an Avance III
HD 500 MHz Bruker Biospin and JEOL AL 300 MHz. The spectra were recorded
using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 relative
to tetramethylsilane (TMS) (0.00 ppm). Chemical shifts in 1H NMR were reported in δ values using an internal standard
(TMS) with a number of protons, multiplicities (s, singlet; d, doublet;
t, triplet; m, multiplet), and coupling constants (J) in hertz (Hz). Open capillaries were employed for determining the
melting points and were uncorrected.

copper sulfate and sodium ascorbate, set aside for a while (until
the ice converted into water completely), filtered, and dried to get
triazole-tethered monocarbonyl curcumin–isatin hybrids.44

Antibacterial Activity
In vitro
antibacterial activity of synthesized hybrids were evaluated against
two Gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) and two Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) human pathogenic bacterial strains by using agar well diffusion
and broth microdilution methods.

Agar Well Diffusion Method
Mueller-Hinton and MacConkey agar plates were employed in the antibacterial
screening of 78 synthesized hybrids. Ten milligrams of test hybrids
and standard drug (levofloxacin) was dissolved in 10 mL DMSO to get
a final solution of 1 mg/mL. One hundred microliters of each hybrid,
standard, and negative control (DMSO) was introduced into the wells
of agar plates, which were seeded with 100 μL of activated bacterial
cultures. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C under
aerobic conditions. Clear zones of inhibition around the wells were
measured and compared with standard and negative control.45

Broth Microdilution Method
Bacteria
grown in Mueller-Hinton and MacConkey agar plates were diluted with
the same corresponding broth media. Test hybrids and the standard
drug were dissolved in DMSO to get the stock solution of 1 mg/mL,
and 2-fold serial dilutions (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, and 1.56
μg/mL) of the stock solution were added to the wells. Then,
the wells were inoculated with bacterial suspensions such that the
final concentration of the inoculum in wells was 100 CFU/mL. Plates
were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. The
lowest concentrations of hybrids with no visible turbidity were recorded
as MIC values.46

Molecular Modeling Studies
The crystal structure of S. aureus DHFR (PDB entry: 3SRQ; resolution, 1.69 Å) was downloaded from Protein Data Bank.
Preparation of the structure was done by using the drug design platform
LeadIT. Cocrystalized ligand 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinoline was used
for defining the binding site with the radius of 6.50 Å.47 Structures of A-4 and B-38 were drawn on ChemDraw Ultra (2013), and their energies were minimized
by employing MM2 force field in Chem3D Ultra software.48 Prepared compounds were used as protonated in
aqueous solution and docked into a prepared binding site using the
FlexX docking module in LeadIT. All FlexX solutions obtained were
scored using a consensus scoring function (CScore) and ranked accordingly.
The top best pose with the highest score was selected for investigation
of interactions, HYDE assessment, and calculation of free energy of
binding (ΔG).49−51 3D enzyme–hybrid
interactions were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer.52
