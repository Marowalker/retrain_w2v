Single-phase white light-emitting
CaxBa(9–x)Lu2Si6O24:Eu2+/Mn2+ codoped phosphors
were successfully synthesized, and their photoluminescence properties
were experimentally determined. The analysis of the experimental results
suggests that the partial substitution of Ba2+ ions by
smaller Ca2+ ions alters the distribution of the Eu2+ luminescence center among the three available Ba2+ sites in the host lattice, which enables the emission to be efficiently
tuned from blue to blue-green-yellow region. The incorporation of
Mn2+ ions resulted in a red light emission at around 618
nm, through energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions via dipole–dipole interactions. The incorporation of
Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions also resulted in improved
thermal stability. The results qualify the produced CaxBa(9–x)Lu2Si6O24:Eu2+/Mn2+ composition as a potential ultraviolet-convertible white light-emitting
phosphor.

1 Introduction
White light-emitting diodes
(WLEDs) are environmentally friendly
materials and exhibit outstanding characteristics, such as high efficiency,
long lifetime, low energy consumption, and high reliability. Phosphors
are indispensable components in WLEDs because they have a strong contribution
to their color index and efficiency.1−5

However, in various types of phosphor-converted WLED systems,
the
combination of the blue LED chip with yellow YAG:Ce3+ phosphors1 does not provide the desired quality of color
of WLEDs because of the poor color rendering index (CRI, Ra < 80), which is due to the lack of red and green
light contributions.6−8 Therefore, the blue LED chip and yellow-emitting
phosphors with a wider spectral coverage in the green/red region or
UV LED (380–420 nm), and red, green, and blue multicomponent
phosphors are combined to achieve high-quality white light with a
high CRI (Ra > 80).2−4,9−11 Nevertheless, the resultant materials
still display poor luminescence efficiency, attributed to reabsorption
phenomena. Accordingly, there is a strong interest in developing highly
efficient phosphors with a tunable color in the entire visible region
under blue or UV light excitation, which must also feature high thermal
quenching temperatures. It is also worthy to note that the use of
single-phase white light phosphors (instead of multicomponent phosphors)
should efficiently improve white LEDs because they can limit some
variations in the phosphors blend.12−19 The latter approach can eventually allow the adjustment and control
of the emission in complementary color regions by a simple mixing
method to obtain white light.

In the case of more than one cation
sites being present at the
host lattice, the activator can preferentially enter the most appropriate
site on account of a possible mismatch between the activator ion and
the host cation at a specific site.20 This
means that the luminescence in such a multication host can shift toward
longer wavelength (and thus effective tuning can be achieved) by increasing
the concentration of doping ions because the activator ions will be
forced to enter less appropriate sites in the host;21−24 yet, the increase in the concentration
of doping ions can cause luminescence quenching. Moreover, modification
in the preferred cation site can also force the luminescence center
to distribute among the available cation sites in a multication host.20,25−29 For instance, in Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphors,
more Eu2+ ions can occupy Sr(II) sites and result in emission
at a long wavelength.24

A typical
example is the Ba9Lu2Si6O24 (BLSO) host, which crystallizes in the rhombohedral
structure and belongs to the R3(148) space group (a = b = 9.9905  , c = 22.1088
 , and V = 1911.04  3),
as shown in Figure 1.30,31 There are three different and independent
Ba2+ crystallographic sites, which are the 12 coordinated
Ba(1) sites, the 9 coordinated Ba(2) sites, and the 10 coordinated
Ba(3) sites with average bond lengths of 3.085   for Ba(1)–O,
2.925   for Ba(2)–O, and 2.934   for Ba(3)–O.
The Eu2+-doped Ba9Sc2Si6O24 and Ba9Y2Si6O24 phosphors emit efficient green light under UV and near-UV
light irradiation.32−35 The efficient green light emission along with their respective excitation
can be adjusted with substitution of Sr2+ for Ba2+.35,36 On the other hand, the Eu2+-doped
BLSO phosphor emits blue light (462 nm) under UV light irradiation
(343 nm), as compared to the green light emission of the aforementioned
Eu2+-doped Ba9Sc2Si6O24 and Ba9Y2Si6O24 phosphors.30,32,35 Nonetheless, there is still poor documentation on this difference,
that is, between the blue light emission in the Eu2+-doped
BLSO phosphor and the green light emission of Ba9Sc2Si6O24 and Ba9Y2Si6O24 phosphors, considering that all of them
have the same crystalline structure. The coordination environment
of the luminescence center is unequivocally a crucial factor in determining
the luminescence properties of activator ions. Therefore, the BLSO
structure offers a potentially wide range of possibilities as far
as the occupation of luminescence ions is concerned.

Ba9Lu2Si6O24 viewed perpendicularly
to the b axis
(a) and the c axis (b); (c) coordinated environment
of Ba(1) (blue spheres), Ba(2) (yellow spheres), Ba(3) (green spheres),
and Lu (purple spheres) with oxygen atoms.

The primary aim of the present study is to shed light on
the origin
of the blue light emission of BLSO:Eu2+ phosphors. Also,
efficient modifications were attempted to cover the full spectrum
of white light. More specifically, the substitution of smaller Ca2+ ions for larger Ba2+ ions aimed for a photoluminescence
(PL) emission that can cover the blue and the green region. Then,
the addition of Mn2+ ions, as coactivators, aimed at expanding
the emission spectrum in the red region, owing to efficient energy
transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. The related properties,
such as PL, stability against temperature, energy-transfer efficiency,
decay time, and CRI values, were thoroughly investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystalline Structure
The influence
of Ca and Mn substitutions on the crystalline structure of the produced
CaxBa(8.8–x)Lu2Si6O24:0.2Eu2+ (for x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8) and
Ca1.5Ba7.38–yLu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+ (for y = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7,
0.9, and 1) phosphors is presented in the diffractograms of Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In all cases, the phase of BLSO (whose X-ray
standard diffraction patterns are plotted at the bottom of the diagrams)
was exclusively identified. The increase of the substitution of Ca2+ and Mn2+ for Ba2+ ions in the host
lattice merely caused a slight shift of the peaks toward higher angles,
as clearly seen in the magnified plots in the region between 30°
and 31° at the right-hand side of the diagrams. This shift suggests
a slight shrinkage of the host lattice, ascribed to the difference
in the ionic radii: they are 100 nm for Ca2+ and 67 nm
for Mn2+, which are smaller than that of Ba2+ (135 nm).

0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8) synthesized at 1400 °C in
an NH3 atmosphere (magnifications between 30° and
31° are presented on the right-hand side). The X-ray standard
patterns of BLSO are also plotted.

°C in an NH3 atmosphere (magnifications between 30°
and 31° are presented on the right-hand side). The X-ray standard
patterns of BLSO are also plotted.

2.2 Influence of Ca Substitution on the PL Properties
The influence of the substitution of Ca2+ ions for Ba2+ ions in the BLSO host on the PL properties of BLSO phosphors
(which actually occurred because of the Eu2+ ions) was
investigated. To obtain a better perspective of the influence of this
substitution, both the nonnormalized and the normalized excitation
(photoluminescence excitation, PLE) and emission (PL) spectra of CaxBa(8.8–x)Eu0.2Lu2Si6O24 phosphors
for x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 are plotted
in the diagrams of Figure 4a,b, respectively.

Figure 4 (a) Nonnormalized and (b) normalized PLE monitored
at their respective
emission wavelength and PL spectra by using λex =
343 nm excitation of CaxBa(8.8–x)Eu0.2Lu2Si6O24 phosphors (for x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2,
1.5, and 1.8), and (c) the three Gaussian components after the deconvolution
of the PL spectra for the BLSO:0.2Eu2+ (bottom plot) and
CBLSO:0.2Eu2+ phosphors (upper plot); λex = 343 nm is the excitation wavelength used for both BLSO:0.2Eu2+ and CBLSO:0.2Eu2+.

The PLE band (Figure 4a) was recorded between 200 and 450 nm, with maximum peaks
at 318
and 343 nm. This broad band, which can be attributed to the 4f7–4f65d1 electric dipole allowed
transition of Eu2+, suggests that the CBLSO phosphors (where
C stands for Ca) can be efficiently excited by both a UV and a near-UV
chip in WLED applications.

An intense blue light emission was
recorded with the Ca-free BLSO:0.2Eu2+ phosphor between
400 and 700 nm, with a peak at 462 nm,
under excitation at 343 nm UV light (Figure 4b). The deconvolution of this emission band
(bottom diagram in Figure 4c) resulted in three Gaussian components with peaks at 465,
496, and 573 nm. This suggests that there are three different types
of luminescence centers in the BLSO host lattice, which should be
correlated to the three different Ba2+ sites, as described
in the Introduction section. According to
the values reported there and in Figure 1, the average Ba–O bond length is
similar for the Ba(2) and Ba(3) sites and shorter than the bond length
of the Ba(1) site. This means that a stronger crystal field strength
is provided, and a nephelauxetic effect on the 5d orbital of Eu2+ occurs in the Ba(2) and Ba(3) sites. The position of the
lowest 5d level for Eu2+ ions in an inorganic host is dependent
on the crystal field splitting of the 5d energy level, and the crystal
field strength is inversely proportional to the distance from the
coordinate ligands to the central cation. Thus, the higher energy
blue light emission peak at 465 nm can be ascribed to the preferential
occupation of Eu2+ ions in the most loose Ba(1) sites,
whereas the lower energy peaks at 496 and 573 nm are due to the occupation
of Eu2+ ions in Ba(3) and Ba(2) sites.

Emission spectra
expand into a longer wavelength when Ca2+ ions progressively
replace Ba2+ ions (Figure 4b, for x >
0) and cover both the blue and the green regions of white light. This
also gradually changes the relative proportion of the intensity of
the three components mentioned above, and the bands with peaks at
496 and 573 nm are intensified (upper plot in Figure 4c). These results suggest that the substitution
of Ca2+ for Ba2+ ions causes a movement of Eu2+ ions from Ba(1) sites to Ba(3) and Ba(2) sites, apparently
because the Ca2+ ions have smaller ionic radii than both
Eu2+ ions and Ba2+ ions. Hence, Ca2+ ions occupy the Ba(1) sites, which leads the Eu2+ ions
to occupy Ba(3) and Ba(2) sites.37

The influence of the Eu2+ concentration on the PLE and
PL spectra of the Ca1.5Ba7.5Lu2Si6O24:zEu2+ phosphors
(CBLSO:zEu2+) for z =
0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12, and 0.15 is shown in the spectra plotted in Figure 5. The intensity of
both PLE and PL spectra increases when the concentration of Eu2+ increases up to z = 0.12. However, further
increase of the Eu2+ content causes a decrease in the intensity,
attributed to concentration quenching. The increase of the Eu2+ concentration also causes a red shift in both PLE and PL
spectra. This suggests a substitution of the smaller Eu2+ ions for the larger ones of Ba2+ in the host. Moreover,
the increase of the concentration of Eu2+ ions causes a
shift of the activators to the Ba(3) and Ba(2) sites, which results
in the red shift in the PLE and PL spectra of the CBLSO phosphors.

PL spectra of Ca1.5Ba(7.5–z)EuzLu2Si6O24 phosphors (for z = 0.06, 0.08,
0.1, 0.12, and 0.15).

2.3 Ca1.5Ba7.5Lu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+ Phosphors
2.3.1 Luminescence Properties
The above
results showed that the increase in the content of Ca2+ ions in CaxBa(9–x)Lu2Si6O24:Eu2+ phosphors broadened the emission spectra (Figure 4) in a way that they covered
both the blue and the green regions, which can produce nearly white
light. Therefore, the next step was to introduce red-emitting Mn2+ ions into the optimum sample, which was the Ca1.5Ba7.5Lu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+ phosphor (Figure 5), to generate high-quality white light.

The influence
of the Mn2+ content on the luminescence spectra of Ca1.5Ba7.38–yLu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+ phosphors (for y = 0, 0.1, 0.3,
0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1), excited at 343 nm, is shown in Figure 6. These results suggest that
codoping with Eu2+ and Mn2+ in the CBLSO host
can generate tunable white light because blue-greenish and red light
emission bands, centered at 484 and 500 nm (because of 4f65d1 to 4f7 transitions of Eu2+ ions),
and also at 618 nm [because of 4T1(4G) to 6A1(6S) transitions of Mn2+ ions), were recorded.

Figure 6 PLE and PL spectra of Ca1.5Ba(7.38–y)Eu0.12MnyLu2Si6O24:yMn2+ phosphors (for y = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7,
0.9, and 1; λex = 343 nm and λem = 484 nm).

The broad emission bands
can be attributed to the transitions of
Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions which occupy the three distinct
Ba sites in the host. The PL intensity due to Eu2+ ions
decreases, and the intensity of the red light emission owing to Mn2+ ions increases with the increase of the Mn2+ content
(y value) up to y = 0.7. Further
increase of the Mn2+ content resulted in a decrease in
the intensity because of the concentration quenching effect.

The influence of the Eu2+ content in the codoped CBLSO:0.3Mn2+, zEu2+ phosphors (i.e., the
Mn2+ concentration was fixed at y = 0.3)
on the PL spectra is plotted in Figure 7 (for z = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12,
and 0.15). The intensity of the red light emission of CBLSO phosphors
due to Mn2+ remarkably enhances with the increase of the
Eu2+ content up to z = 0.12. Further increase
in the Eu2+ concentration (z = 0.12 and
beyond) led to a decrease in the emission intensity, owing to the
concentration quenching effect.

Figure 7 PL emission spectra of CBLSO:0.3Mn2+, zEu2+ phosphors (for z = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08,
0.1, 0.12, and 0.15) by using excitation wavelength 343 nm.

2.3.2 Energy
Transfer
The above results
(Figures 6 and 7) suggest that energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions should efficiently occur. The decay time
is of great importance, as it can validate this hypothesis. Thus,
the PL decay time profiles of CBLSO:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+ (for the same phosphors Ca1.5Ba7.38–yLu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+, reported in 3.3.1 and Figure 6) were recorded by
using an excitation wavelength at 343 nm and a monitored wavelength
at 484 nm. The results, shown in the plots of Figure 8, were rendered well by the sum of two exponential
decay components 1  where A1 and A2 are the exponential constants and τ1 and τ2 are the decay time constants. Thus,
the average fluorescence decay times (τ*) can be calculated
by the formula illustrated in eq 2.38 2  

Figure 8 Fluorescence decay times
of the CBLSO:0.12Eu2+/yMn2+ phosphors (for y = 0,
0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1; λex = 340 nm and
λem = 484 nm).

The results of the average fluorescence decay times (τ*),
calculated by using eq 2, are presented in Figure 8. The fluorescence decay time decreases from 161 to 133, 105,
93, 70, 68, and 64 ns for y = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7,
0.9, and 1, respectively. The decrease in the decay time by increasing
the Mn2+ concentration suggests that efficient energy transfer
from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions in CBLSO phosphors should
occur.

The values of the energy-transfer efficiency, η,
from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions were calculated for different
Mn2+ concentrations using eq 3 3  where IS and IS0 are the values of luminescence
intensity
in the presence and absence of the activator Mn2+, respectively.
The results, plotted in the diagram of Figure 9, suggest that the energy-transfer efficiency
increases with the increase of the Mn2+ concentration.
At the optimal concentration of Mn2+ (y = 0.7), the value of η is 67%.

Figure 9 Energy-transfer efficiency

in Mn (y = 0.1,
0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1).

The mechanism of the energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ can be investigated via Dexter’s energy-transfer
formula of multipolar interactions, and the following relation can
be obtained39 4  where C represents the total
concentration of the sensitizer Eu2+ and the activator
Mn2+. The values of n are 6, 8, or 10
for dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole
interactions, respectively. The plots of IS0/IS versus Cn/3 are shown in Figure 10, for the three values of n: 6 (Figure 10a),
8 (Figure 10b), and
10 (Figure 10c). The
best linear fitting is clearly seen for n = 6 (R2 = 0.995, Figure 10a). This finding suggests that the energy
transfer from the sensitizer Eu2+ to the activator Mn2+ in the CBLSO:Eu2+/Mn2+ phosphors predominantly
takes place through dipole–dipole interactions.

2.3.3 CIE Color Coordinates
The produced
CBLSO phosphors present the ability to tune the color coordinates
by just adjusting the concentrations of Ca and Mn. The plot of Figure 11 was created by
excitation with UV light at 343 nm. Starting from point A (the precise
contents in the phosphor are reported in the legend of the figure),
the addition of Mn2+ (from y = 0 to 1)
allows the tuning of the emitting color from blue-greenish (point
A) to white and yellow (point B). Then, the increase of the Ca2+ content (from x = 0.6 to 0.9) can shift
the emission light to the points C, D, and E, which are in the white
area of the diagram.

0.3,
0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1) and CaxBa(8.58–x)Lu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/0.3Mn2+ (x = 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2)
samples under 343 nm excitation. The photographs show the optimum
Ca0.6Ba7.98Si6O24:0.12Eu2+/0.3Mn2+ phosphor under (a) daylight and (b) 365
nm UV light.

These results qualify
the produced CBLSO:Eu2+/Mn2+ compositions as
efficient color tunable phosphors, which
can be considered as single-phase white light-emitting phosphors for
application in WLEDs. The two photographs on the right-hand side of Figure 11 illustrate the
prepared CBLSO:Eu2+/Mn2+ phosphor powder under
common daylight and its efficient white light under UV light excitation
at 365 nm.

The emission spectrum of the fabricated white LED
lamp under 365
nm UV light is illustrated in Figure 12. High-quality white light was obtained, with CIE chromaticity
coordinates (0.380, 330), which are positioned in the region of white
light, and can be efficiently tuned by varying the concentration of
Ca2+, Eu2+, and Mn2+ cations. The
inset of Figure 12 shows the white light-emitting lamp (LED lamp excited at 365 nm),
which emits a warm white light by using a CBLSO:Eu2+/Mn2+ phosphor in combination with a commercial 365 nm UV chip.

of 365 nm UV light. The inset shows the real image of the fabricated
white LED.

2.3.4 Influence
of Temperature on PL Properties
The influence of the temperature
on the PL of the produced phosphors
was also investigated. The emission spectra recorded at different
temperatures for the Ca-free (BLSO, x = 0) and the
Ca-doped CaxBa(9–x)Lu2Si6O24:0.12Eu2+ phosphors for x = 0.15 under excitation at 343
nm are plotted in Figure 13a,b, respectively. The intensity of the PL spectra decreases
with the increase of temperature. This can be associated with the
fact of the increased probability of nonradiative transition induced
by thermal activation and the release of the luminescent center through
the crossing point between the excited state and the ground state.
The color of the emission remains unchanged with the rise of temperature.
This suggests that these phosphors have a stable color quality even
at high temperatures. However, a decrease in the intensity with the
increase of temperature was recorded.

Figure 13 PL spectra of the CaxBa(8.8–x)Eu0.2Lu2Si6O24 phosphors
at different temperatures for x = 0 (a) and x = 1.5 (b) and comparison of the temperature
dependence of the PL emission maximum intensity of the Ca-free, the
Ca-doped, and the Ca–Mn codoped CBLSO phosphors (c).

The differences in the decrease
of emission intensity for the Ca-free
(BLSO:Eu2+), the single Ca-doped (CBLSO:0.12Eu2+), and the codoped phosphors (CBLSO:Eu2+/Mn2+) at temperatures between room temperature (RT) and 150 °C are
shown in the curves in Figure 13c. It is clearly seen that doping of the BLSO host
favors the temperature stability of PL. The best behavior was recorded
with the codoped phosphors.

The improvement in the thermal stability
might be related to two
phenomena. The first one deals with the contraction of the unit cell
volume, which occurs because of the substitution of the smaller Ca2+ cations for the larger Ba2+ cations in the BLSO
phosphor host. This should increase the structural rigidity of the
host and affect the interactions between Eu2+ and O2– ions (related to nephelauxetic and crystal field
effects of the 5d orbital of Eu2+) which vary.40,41 On the other hand, the increase in the content of Ca2+ ions favors the movement of the activator Eu2+ ions from
the Ba(1) sites to the Ba(2) and Ba(3) sites. Because the Ba(2) and
Ba(3) sites are smaller than the Ba(1) sites, the former should have
smaller bond length with oxygen compared to the bond length in the
case of Ba(1)–O, providing different surrounding environments
for the Eu2+ ions.

3 Conclusions
Single-phase full color-emitting Eu2+/Mn2+ codoped CBLSO phosphors were successfully synthesized using a high-temperature
solid-state reaction method. The produced phosphors can perfectly
match the needs of a UV LED chip because they exhibit a broad excitation
band, which ranges from 200 to 450 nm with the maximum peak at 343
nm. The substitution of larger Ba2+ ions by smaller Ca2+ ions distributes the Eu2+ activator ions among
the available sites Ba(1), Ba(2), and Ba(3) in the CBLSO host, which
broadens the emission spectra and improves thermal stability. The
luminescence of the produced CBLSO phosphors can be further improved
by the substitution of Mn2+ ions at a specific amount.
The luminescence spectra, the calculated energy-transfer efficiency,
and the decay times of the produced phosphors suggested that an efficient
energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions occurs
in the CBLSO host, which takes place predominantly through dipole–dipole
interactions. The emission of the produced CBLSO phosphors can be
efficiently tuned by merely adjusting the amounts of the doping ions,
and high-quality tunable white light emission can be achieved.

4 Materials and Experimental Procedure
A series of BLSO-based
phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature
solid-state reaction route (the precise compositions are presented
in the section of the Results and Discussion). Fine powders of CaCO3, BaCO3, SiO2, MnCO3 (99.99% purity Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.
Ltd., Shanghai, PR China), Lu2O3, and Eu2O3 (99.99%, Yuelong Co. Ltd. Shanghai, PR China)
were used as raw materials.

Powder mixtures of the raw materials
in stoichiometric proportions
were thoroughly mixed and ground in an Si3N4 mortar. The homogeneous mixtures were transferred to alumina crucibles,
which were then put into a horizontal tubular furnace and heated at
1400 °C for 4 h under flowing NH3 gas (the heating
rate was 300 K/h). Then, the synthesized samples were cooled naturally
to RT inside the furnace under flowing NH3 gas. Fine powders
were obtained (by grinding) for further characterization.

The
crystallized phases of the synthesized samples were identified
by X-ray diffraction analysis (Philips PW 1700, using Cu Kα1
radiation, λ = 1.54056  , at 40 kV, and 100 mA, with
a graphite monochromator). The samples were placed in a silica chip,
which was positioned vertically in the equipment with a 2θ/θ
scan axis. The data were recorded in the range between 20° and
60°, with a scanning rate of 0.5°/min and a step of 2θ
0.0167°.

The PLE and emission spectra were measured by
using a Hitachi F-7000
spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation
source. The spectra of PL of both the excitation and emission were
corrected for the spectral response of a monochromatic and Hamamatsu
R928P photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan)
by a light diffuser and tungsten lamp (NOMA Electric Corp., NY; 10
V, 4 A).

The thermal stability of the phosphor at selected compositions
was evaluated by recording the PL spectra at different temperatures.
More specifically, the phosphor was placed on an aluminum plaque with
cartridge heaters. The temperature was measured by thermocouples put
inside the plaque and controlled with a standard TAP-02 high-temperature
fluorescence controller. Starting from RT, the PL spectrum was recorded.
Then, the temperature was increased, and when it was stabilized, the
PL spectrum was recorded. Next, the temperature was fixed at a higher
value, and the PL spectrum was recorded at that temperature. Measurements
were conducted at RT, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 °C.
