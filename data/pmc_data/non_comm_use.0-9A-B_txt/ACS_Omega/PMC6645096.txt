A sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)
(SPEEK) and phosphorylated
graphene oxide (PGO) composite of a cation-exchange membrane with
low frictional coefficient and high limiting current density has been
reported for water desalination by rapid electrodialysis. The incorporation
of PGO in the membrane matrix showed a significant impact on the macroscopic
properties, counterion frictional coefficient, and performance of
the membrane. A well-optimized SPEEK/PGO-8 (8%
PGO content, w/w) membrane showed improved conductivity (4.15 ×
10–2 S cm–1) and permselectivity
(87%), and excellent stabilities (thermal, mechanical, and chemical)
because of cherished polymer–PGO (filler) interaction via H-bonding. The efficiency of the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane was also evaluated for
the desalination of brackish water near limiting current density (Ilim). Ion concentration polarization (ICP)
was assessed by i–V curves,
and below Ilim, water splitting or change
in product water pH was ruled out. While above Ilim (10.5 mA cm–2), ICP was significant and
could be finally tuned with applied current density for producing
desalinated water with a desired pH. Furthermore, improved Ilim, high current efficiency (82.9%), and low
energy consumption (7.9 kWh kg–1 of the salt removed)
of the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane during electrodialysis provide a broad
current window for efficient and rapid water desalination/purification.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Because
of the growing scarcity of potable water around the globe,
there is an ever-increasing demand of desalination/purification of
water received from the sources such as rivers, seas, and ground.1,2 To fulfill the increasing demand
of drinking water, advantageous membrane technologies are used.1−3 In many membrane-based water desalination/purification technologies
such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration, membranes reject the salt
and large molecules and allow the passage of water.1,4,5 During desalination, the reduction of excessive
concentration of nutritious constituents (Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42–, CO32 –/HCO3–, etc.) is
unwanted.3−6 Electrodialysis (ED) for the separation of mono- and bivalent ions
has been reported because of different rates of migration.7−9 Thus, ED was considered as a desalination technology for comparatively
better retention of nutritious ions in the desalinated water.3

Over the recent years, the rapid growth
of membrane technologies
in chemical industries has significantly increased the need of stable
and permselective ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) for separation, purification,
and isolation of target molecules.10−12 For separating inorganic
ions from organic molecules, IEM-based ED has been widely utilized
in food, drug, chemical, and water industries (desalination).13−17 ED effectively removes ions from feed streams and requires IEMs
with high selectivities, especially when employed for water desalination.18,19 With a fine control over applied current density, concentration
polarization (water splitting) and ionic migration (transport) can
be tuned as per requirements.20 The development
of IEMs with high selectivities and superior stabilities (chemical,
thermal, and mechanical) is quite essential for a high-performance
ED process for versatile applications.

Significant attention
was paid to develop polymeric or organic–inorganic
hybrid membranes with increased permselectivity and ion-exchange capacity
(IEC), and lowered resistivity by chemical modification.21−25 These properties are essential for suitable water-desalination IEMs.26 Generally, membrane conductivity and IEC values
depend on the structural properties of the membranes and control the
membrane hydrophilic nature (water content) and ionic mobility.27 In our previous work, we reported an easy method
to improve the membrane performance and efficiency by fine tuning
the structural morphology and the extent of functionalization using
inorganic fillers.28 The inclusion of sulfonated
graphene oxide in the polymer matrix significantly improved conductivity,
water retention, and mechanical properties of the membrane.29,30

We studied a synergetic effect of
the inclusion of phosphorylated graphene oxide (PGO) in sulfonated
poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) matrix to improve surface charge
density, responsible for showing a delayed ion concentration polarization
(ICP) phenomenon and thus relatively high limiting current density
(Ilim).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of PGO and SPEEK/PGO
Membranes
In GO, the presence of oxygen-containing functional
groups (−OH, −COOH, =CO, etc.) was assessed by
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (Figure 1). Absorption bands at υ = 3403, 1720,
1620, and 1053 cm–1 aroused because of O–H
stretching, C=O stretching, adsorbed water, and C–O
stretching vibration, respectively. Synthesis of APSGO was confirmed
by bands at 2929, 688, and 1147 cm–1 attributed
to the C–H (methylene groups), Si–C, and Si–O
stretching, respectively. Peaks at 3418, 1628, 1079, and 778 cm–1 correspond to −N–H stretching, −N–H
bending, −C–N stretching, and −N–H wagging
of an aliphatic primary amine, respectively. Phosphorylation of APSGO
was achieved by formaldehyde and phosphorous acid (1:1, w/w), and
the preparation of PGO was confirmed by peaks at 1388 cm–1, which may be due to P=O stretching of organophosphate in
the FTIR spectrum (Figure 1).

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of SPEEK/PGO, APSGO, and GO.

To prepare SPEEK, sulfonation of PEEK was achieved using
concentrated
H2SO4 and characterized by 1H NMR
spectra (Figure 2).
Degree of functionalization (sulfonation) was also evaluated by 1H NMR spectra and was found to be about 63.0%.31

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of SPEEK.

Different SPEEK/PGO composite membranes of varied compositions
were fabricated by solution casting method, and FTIR data revealed
peaks at υ = 696 and 978 cm–1, which were
attributed to Si–C and Si–O groups, respectively (Figure 1). Absorption bands
at υ = 1041, 1139 (SO2 symmetric stretching), and
1348 cm–1 (SO2 asymmetric stretching)
revealed the grafting of −SO3H groups with the membrane
matrix. Peaks at υ = 1651 and 1746 cm–1 correspond
to C=C bond stretching of the phenol ring and symmetric stretching
of C=O groups, respectively.32 The
broad peak at υ = 3425 cm–1 aroused because
of strong H-bonding between SPEEK and PGO. On the basis of these information,
a schematic structure of SPEEK/PGO membranes was included in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Reaction scheme for the
preparation of the SPEEK/PGO membranes.

The morphology of a membrane surface controls its performance.28,33 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (surface and cross section)
for the pristine SPEEK membrane exhibited a uniform, homogeneous,
and dense nature of the surface without any cracks or holes (Figure 4A,B), whereas the
SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane showed a nonuniform surface morphology (Figure 4C). SPEEK contains
an aromatic hydrocarbon chain (hydrophobic) on which hydrophilic −SO3H groups are grafted, while PGO is hydrophilic in nature.
These characteristics may be responsible for the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
phase separated morphology of the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane. The cross-sectional
image of the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane also confirms homogenously distributed
PGO in the SPEEK matrix (Figure 4D). In addition, SEM images revealed good compatibility
between SPEEK and PGO because of H-bonding.

surface, (B) SPEEK cross section, (C) SPEEK/PGO-8
surface, and (D) SPEEK/PGO-8 cross section.

2.2 Thermal, Mechanical, Chemical, and Hydrolytic
Stabilities of SPEEK/PGO Membranes
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) spectra of pristine SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes showed a three-step
weight-loss pattern (Figure S1, Supporting
Information). The first-step weight loss (below 100 °C) was assigned
to the loss of trapped water in the hydrophilic functional domain
formed because of chemical grafted −SO3H and −PO3H2 groups. The decomposition of oxygen-containing
groups (CO, CO2, SO3H, etc.) was responsible
for the second-step weight loss in the range of 200–400 °C.
Above 450 °C, weight loss corresponded to the decomposition of
the SPEEK backbone. Finally, the remaining residues
of SPEEK/PGO membranes were more in comparison with those of the SPEEK
membrane, which showed the improved thermal stability of the former.

The mechanical stability of SPEEK/PGO membranes was assessed by
their burst strength data included in Table 1. The burst strength of the pristine SPEEK
membrane (3.57 kg cm–2) was progressively increased
with the incorporation of PGO, and the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane showed
improved 4.00 kg cm–2 burst strength value.

Table 1 Percentage Loss in Weight and IEC
under Oxidative and Hydrolytic Environment and Burst Strength Data
for Different Membranes
 	oxidative
stability (loss %)	hydrolytic
stability (loss %)	 	
membrane	weight	IEC	weight	IEC	burst strength (kg cm–2)	
SPEEK	2.05	0.59	1.02	0.33	3.57	
SPEEK/PGO-4	2.12	0.76	1.49	0.57	3.77	
SPEEK/PGO-6	2.08	0.89	2.02	0.82	4.07	
SPEEK/PGO-8	2.17	1.06	1.58	0.75	4.00	
The stability and durability of membranes under harsh
oxidative
environment (diversified electromembrane processes, where water splitting
and formation of free radicals regularly occur because of the electrode
reaction) is an urgent requirement to assess their suitability. The
oxidative stabilities of SPEEK/PGO membranes were investigated by
percentage loss in weight and IEC after the test with Fenton’s
reagent (3% H2O2 solution containing 3 ppm Fe2+) for 1 h at 80 °C (Table 1). About 2.05 and 0.59% weight and IEC loss,
respectively, were recorded for the pristine SPEEK membrane, whereas
different SPEEK/PGO membranes also exhibited about similar weight
and IEC loss value. Thus, negligible weight and IEC loss values (≤2.0%)
for SPEEK/PGO membranes revealed their oxidative stable nature. It
seems that the structural degradation in SPEEK matrix was responsible
for the observed weight/IEC loss, while the incorporation of PGO results
in an improvement in oxidative stabilities of SPEEK/PGO membranes.

Under hydrolytic conditions, pristine SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes
also showed approximately 1.0–2.0% weight and IEC loss after
10 days (240 h) in pressurized steam (100 °C) (Table 1). It seems that the nucleophilic-attack-resistant
nature of pristine SPEEK membranes further improves after the incorporation
of PGO. Furthermore, in harsh hydrolytic environment, these membranes
retained their flexible nature.

2.3 Physicochemical
Properties of SPEEK/PGO Membranes
Generally, ion-exchange
membranes contain conducting and nonconducting
phases. The inclusion of PGO in highly charged polymer SPEEK is expected
to reduce the fraction of the nonconducting phase and improve membrane
properties significantly.29 Improved functional
charge density and conductivity were achieved by the inclusion of
PGO (chemical grafted −PO3H2 groups)
in the SPEEK matrix. The water uptake (WU) values also confirmed the
hydrophilic nature of these membranes, which improved with the PGO
content (Table 2).
The SPEEK membrane showed 26.19% WU, while 62.03% WU was observed
in the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane. Interestingly, swelling-ratio (SR) values
for these membranes were constant, irrespective of the PGO composition
in the membrane phase (Figure 5). A significant improvement in functional charge density
(−PO3H2 and −SO3H)
and H-bonding between PGO and the SPEEK matrix may be assigned to
the reduced dimensional instability and thus SR. In our view, a trade-off
study on PGO and SPEEK content in the membrane matrix is necessary
to tailor the dimensionally stable membrane with improved IEC and
conductivity for practical applications.

Figure 5 Bound water (%), bulk
water (%), and swelling-ratio (SR) (%) profiles
of different CEMs with varied PGO content.

Table 2 WU, IEC, Ps, t+m, κm, and Ilim Values of Different
Cation-Exchange Membranes (CEMs)
membrane	WU (%)	IEC (mequiv g–1)	Ps	t+m	κm × 10–2 (S cm–2)	Ilim (mA cm–2)	
SPEEK	26.19	1.33	0.70	0.71	1.43	4.9	
SPEEK/PGO-4	43.76	1.74	0.77	0.86	3.52	7.2	
SPEEK/PGO-6	59.52	2.04	0.80	0.88	3.91	8.1	
SPEEK/PGO-8	62.03	2.23	0.87	0.92	4.15	9.6	
The presence of charged groups in
the membrane phase is responsible for IEC values, and IEC value for
the pristine SPEEK membrane (1.33 mequiv g–1) increased
to 2.23 mequiv g–1 for the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane,
which may be due to the highly charged nature of components forming
both membranes (SPEEK and PGO) (Table 2). To assess the elevated temperature applicability,
the water retention capacity of these membranes was studied, which
directly depends on the bound water content. Bulk water (WU) occupies
the space within pores or holes of the membrane phase, while bound
water was strongly attached with the membrane phase. The bound water
content was investigated by weight loss (TGA) between 100 and 150
°C, assuming 100% weight at 100 °C. It was observed that
the bound water content improved with the PGO content in the SPEEK
phase (Figure 5). Relatively
high bound water content of SPEEK/PGO membrane reduced membrane dewatering
and improved water retention capacity. The SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane with
high bound water content was assessed as a promising material for
high-temperature use. High content of bound water also improved membrane
conductivity under dehydrated environment.

2.4 Membrane
Conductivity, Permselectivity, and
Frictional Interpretation
The membrane conductivities of
pristine SPEEK and different SPEEK/PGO membranes were measured with
0.10 M NaCl solution (Table 2) at 30 °C. The pristine SPEEK membrane showed 1.43 ×
10–2 S cm–1 conductivity, while
4.15 × 10–2 S cm–1 conductivity
was observed for the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane. It seems that the inclusion
of PGO in the membrane phase increased the functional nature of membranes
and facilitated ionic migration in the electromembrane process. Furthermore,
the increased conductivities of SPEEK/PGO membranes may be assigned
to the (i) high water content in the membrane phase (high WU) necessary
for ionic migration; (ii) increased IEC; and/or (iii) good interaction
between the PGO and SPEEK. The above-mentioned factors were responsible
for increased conductivities of SPEEK/PGO membranes.

A chronopotentiometry
study was used to estimate membrane permselectivity (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The chronopotentiometric
responses for pristine SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes were recorded
in equilibrated environment with 0.10 M NaCl solution at 4.0 mA cm–2 applied current density (Figure 6). All of these membranes showed well-defined
inflections at different transition times (τ) under similar
experimental conditions. In chronopotentiograms, inflections were
observed because of the depletion of counterions, concentration at
membrane–solution interfacial zone due to easy migration and
high mobility of counterions (Na+) under the influence
of applied current density (concentration polarization). τ measures
the time required for polarization, which, in turn, depends on counterion
transport number in the membrane phase (t+m) or permselectivity
(Ps). The t+m and Ps values for pristine SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes were
estimated by chronopotentiograms and are included in Table 2. The Ps value for the pristine SPEEK membrane (0.70) increased to 0.87 for
the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane (Table 2), which may be due to relatively low Donnan exclusion
in the case of previous one, while the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane exhibited
improved Ps value because of high surface
charge concentration (IEC) and was therefore assessed as a promising
candidate for charge-based discrimination of cations and anions.

Figure 6 Chronopotentiometric
curves of pristine SPEEK and different SPEEK/PGO
membranes in 0.01 M NaCl solution environment at 4.0 mA cm–2 applied current density.

On the basis of Keedem and Katchalsky approach, membrane
conductance
and fixed charge density (X) values were used with
an advantage for the investigation of frictional coefficient between
solute and membrane matrix (fsm). The fsm value indicates the strength of interaction between counterion and
membrane phase and may calculated as follows34,35 1  where φw (water volume fraction
in the membrane phase), ω (solute permeability), Δx (membrane thickness), X (fixed charge
concentration in the membrane phase), Cs (average salt concentration), and tm (counterion transport number in the membrane phase) are defined
in Section S1 of the Supporting Information.
The fsm values of SPEEK and different
SPEEK/PGO membranes at different temperatures are included in Figure 7. The fsm values decreased with the inclusion of PGO in the membrane
phase at a constant temperature. PGO is responsible for the formation
of ion-conducting channels in the membrane phase and lowered friction
between membrane and counterion. Thus, the inclusion of PGO in the
SPEEK phase also improved ionic migration across membranes, which
is very significant at relatively high temperature.

SPEEK and different SPEEK/PGO membranes in equilibrium with 0.1 M
NaCl solution.

2.5 Current–Voltage
(i–V) Curves and Electrodialysis
Performance
The i–V curves of SPEEK
and different SPEEK/PGO membranes exhibited three typical characteristic
regions, viz., Ohmic, non-Ohmic, and plateau length zones. These regions
reveal the ionic migration, concentration polarization, and water
dissociation, respectively, under applied potential gradient (Figure 8).10,36 Across ion-exchange membranes, tim (counterion transport number
in the membrane phase) is greater than tis (counterion transport
number in solution); thus, outgoing counterion flux across the membrane
interfaces (Jim) is always greater than the incoming counterion
flux from solution to the membrane interface 2  This phenomenon
causes concentration polarization
and counterion concentration at the membrane interface tend to zero,
resulting in water splitting due to applied potential gradient (the
plateau region in the i–V curve). The limiting current density (Ilim) may be obtained from the current density corresponding to the plateau
region.37,38 The Ilim values
of unmodified SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes are proportional to the
fixed charge groups in the membrane matrix or alternatively to membrane
permselectivity. High Ilim value for the
SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane provides a broader window for applying higher
current to achieve faster ionic transport across the ion-exchange
membranes. In addition, ion concentration polarization (ICP) across
the ion-exchange membranes in ED may be utilized with an advantage
to produce desalinated water with controllable alkaline pH, in view
of relatively fast electromigration of H+ in comparison
with OH– produced by water splitting (ICP) above Ilim.

Figure 8 i–V curves of the pristine
SPEEK and SPEEK/PGO membranes in environment of 0.10 M NaCl solution.

ED experiments were carried out
in an ED unit containing 10 cell
pairs of SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane (CEMs) and anion exchange membranes
(AEMs) (effective area: 100 cm2) in a continuous mode of
operation (flow rate: 0.001 m3 h–1) for
desalinating brackish water (pH: ∼7.0 and total dissolved solid
(TDS): 4000 ppm) and producing potable water (pH: ∼8.0 and
TDS: ∼300 ppm) under a constant applied current density. Different
experiments were performed under similar conditions with varied applied
current densities (below, above, and at Ilim) to explore the controllable alteration in the pH of the product
water (desalinated stream, DS) by ICP. The pH profile of the product
water produced by an electrodialyzer operated under mentioned conditions
has been depicted in Figure 9. We took care to maintain the TDS of the product water stream
output at about 300 ppm by controlling the flow rate and thus the
residence time. Using SPEEK/PGO-8 and AEM, ED experiments were carried
out under three modes, viz., <Ilim,
∼Ilim, and >Ilim. Figure 9A represents the pH profile of the product water (TDS: 300 ppm) produced
by ED operated below Ilim (8.0 mA cm–2). Below Ilim, ICP at
the membrane interface, facing DS compartment, is completely ruled
out and thus there is no chance of water splitting or alteration in
the pH. A scheme of water splitting by ICP at the membrane interface
facing DS compartment is also depicted in Figure 9A. The desalting rate (J) at I = 8.0 mA cm–2 is low in
comparison with relatively high applied current density. Furthermore, comparatively high current efficiency (CE) and low E values (Table 3) suggested the absence of water splitting or pH changes in
this case. (Detailed methods for measuring J, CE,
and E are included in Section S5 of the Supporting Information.)

by the desalination of brackish water (TDS: 4000 ppm) by ED operated

a Feed water TDS: 4000 ppm; product
water TDS: 300 ppm.

On the
other hand, at Ilim (9.6 mA
cm–2), pH of the feed water (pH: 6.5) was slightly
increased to 7.1, which may be due to partial ICP (Figure 9B). Because of ICP (under polarized
conditions), water dissociation occurs at the membrane interface (CEM
and AEM) facing DS compartments (depletion of counterions) under applied
electrical gradient. Because of fast mobility, H+ instantly
migrated toward respective adjacent compartments while OH– was trapped by Na+ to maintain the electroneutrality.
Thus, polarization is responsible for the formation of NaOH and slight
increase in the pH of the DS output.

Above Ilim (10.5 mA cm–2), ICP in the electrodialyzer
was significant and carefully optimized
by applied current density without any deterioration in TDS of the
product water. Figure 9C presents the product water pH profile produced by the electrodialyzer
operated above Ilim. In this case, pH
of the product water was increased to ∼8.0 while maintaining
the TDS (300 ppm). Rate of desalting (J) also increased
with driving force (applied current density), while CE value considerably
deteriorated along with a significant increase in energy consumption.
The CE and E values determine the process efficiency,
and it seems that the efficiency of ED was reduced significantly above Ilim, which may be due to the energy consumed
for water splitting. Furthermore, in spite of faster desalting rate,
the energy consumption of ED and the requirement of pH change in the
product water stream should also be considered before the optimization
of an electrodialyzer. CE values of the electrolytic desalination
process indicate desalination efficiency of the ion-exchange membranes
and percentage utilization of applied current for ion transport rather
than mass transport or water splitting across the electrodes. The
obtained CE value of the optimal SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane has been compared
with that of other CEMs reported in the literature for electrodialytic
water desalination (Table 4).3,39−41 The SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane
showed 82.9% CE, which is relatively high in comparison with that
of other CEMs (64.3–74.5%). The high CE value of the SPEEK/PGO-8
CEM may be attributed to the high conductivity, ion-exchange capacity,
and quite dense nature (low mass transfer). Furthermore, high performance
and good stability of the reported SPEEK/PGO-8 CEM are attractive
features for electrodialytic water desalination.

In our view, by varying merely the
applied current density with
respect to Ilim, pH of the product water
can be controlled precisely as per the requirement and pH of the feed
water, while TDS of the product water may be kept unaltered. In a
broad manner, pH of the drinking water should vary between 6.5 and
8.5, as per the requirement of consumers. However, too high pH (<8.5)
of the product water is not acceptable as per the recommendations
of different agencies;42,43 however, the ED operating parameters
should be fine-tuned according to the drinking water flavor and salinity/mineral
content. In some cases, the operation of
an electrodialyzer above Ilim is associated
with a slight deterioration in CE with improved E, but these are marginal effects and cannot affect the process performance
in a broader way.

3 Conclusions
We report
an easy procedure to prepare a SPEEK/PGO composite bifunctionalized
CEM with excellent stabilities (thermal, mechanical, and chemical)
and physicochemical and electrochemical properties. It was observed
that membrane properties were considerably enhanced with the incorporation
of PGO in the SPEEK matrix, and especially, the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane
showed high WU (62.03), IEC (2.23 mequiv g–1), bound
water content (4.60%), and SR (15.18%). High conductivity (4.15 ×
10–2 S cm–1) and permselectivity
(0.87) with high Ilim (9.6 mA cm–1) of the SPEEK/PGO-8 membrane provide a broad window for applying
high current density to achieve fast water desalination.

The
SPEEK/PGO composite CEM not only promoted the conductivity,
permselectivity, bound water content but also improved the membrane
stabilities. i–V and chronopotentiometry
analyses revealed the good electrotransport properties of the SPEEK/PGO-8
membrane suitable for electroseparation. Furthermore, strong H-bond
interaction between PGO and SPEEK provides high surface charge density
and ion-conducting channels, which significantly reduces counterion
friction with the membrane matrix. Below Ilim, the absence of water splitting or the alteration in the pH ruled
out polarization at the membrane interface, while above Ilim (10.5 mA cm–2), significant polarization
and thus water splitting were observed during electrodialysis. We concluded that polarization at
the membrane interface can be used with an advantage of a fine control
over product water alkalinity with unaltered TDS for efficient/rapid
water desalination,

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(ether ether ketone)
(PEEK) (medium melt viscosity grade 450 PF) was obtained from Victrex
PLC, England, and 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (99%) was received
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals. Graphite (Gt) powder (size 100 μm),
dimethylacetamide (DMAc), phosphoric acid, formaldehyde, acetone,
methanol, H2SO4, NaOH, NaCl, NaNO3, KMnO4, H2O2, HCl, and Na2SO4 of analytical grade were obtained from SD Fine Chemicals,
India and used with proper purification. All experiments were performed
using ultrapure water (resistivity: 18.2 MΩ cm).

4.2 Synthesis of Phosphorylate Graphene Oxide
and Sulphonated PEEK
Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized
according to modified Hummers procedure and phosphorylated by the
method reported earlier.1,44

To synthesize
sulphonated PEEK (SPEEK), sulfonation was achieved by concentrated
H2SO4 at 60 °C under stirring. In a typical
procedure, PEEK powder (12 g) was gradually dissolved in concentrated
H2SO4 (125 mL) under constant stirring at 50
°C for 3 h. After complete dissolution, the viscous solution
was continuously stirred for another 6 h at 55–60 °C.
Afterward, sulfonation reaction was terminated and SPEEK was precipitated
under constant agitation in excess of ice-cold water. Precipitated
SPEEK was washed three times with ultrapure water for the complete
removal of impurities and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 80 °C.
The degree of sulfonation of SPEEK was estimated to be about 63% by 1H NMR spectra (Figure 2).

4.3 Membrane Preparation
SPEEK/PGO composite membranes were prepared by solution casting method
as described. A known quantity of SPEEK (15 wt %) was dissolved in
DMAc at 45 °C under constant agitation, and simultaneously a
certain amount of PGO was dispersed in a known volume of DMAc under
sonication for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. The PGO dispersion
was then added to the viscous polymer (SPEEK) solution, and the mixture
was stirred for 24 h at 30 °C. The resultant viscous polymer
solution was cast as a thin film (thickness: ∼150 μm)
onto a cleaned flat glass plate with the help of a doctor blade. The
obtained membrane was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24
h. After cooling, the resultant membrane was peeled off from the glass
plate and conditioned in 1 M H2SO4 for 24 h
and finally washed with ultrapure water to remove impurities. SPEEK/PGO
composite membranes were named SPEEK/PGO-x, where x denotes the weight percentage of PGO (x = 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 wt %), and SPEEK/PGO-0 membrane was referred
to as the pristine membrane (SPEEK).

4.4 Membrane
Characterization
Detailed
instrumental analyses such as FTIR spectra, 1H NMR spectra,
wide-angle X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and burst strength analyses are
included in Section S2 of the Supporting
Information.

4.5 Water Uptake, Ion-Exchange
Capacity, and Swelling-Ratio
Measurements
Detailed methods for the estimation of water
uptake, ion-exchange capacity, and swelling ratio have been included
in Section S3 of the Supporting Information.

4.6 Membrane Conductivity and Chronopotentiometry
Conductivities of pristine and SPEEK/PGO membranes were studied
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in equilibrium with 0.1
M NaCl solution using a potentiostat/galvanostat frequency response
analyzer (Auto Lab, model PGSTAT 30). Membranes were kept in between
electrodes (circular stain-less steel with 4 cm2 area). Direct current and sinusoidal alternating current were applied to
record the Nyquist plots in the frequency range of 106–1 Hz
and at 1 mA s–1 scanning rate. Membrane resistance
was determined by the slope of Nyquist plots by the Fit and Simulation.10

Chronopotentiometric studies were performed
in a two-compartment membrane cell depicted in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Details about chronopotentiometric
studies and equation used for the estimation of membrane permselectivity
are included in the Section S4 (Supporting
Information).

4.7 Membrane Stabilities and
Burst Strength
Oxidative stabilities of SPEEK/PGO membranes
were studied by soaking
the small pieces of membrane samples in Fenton’s reagent (3%
H2O2 aqueous solution containing 3 ppm FeSO4) at 80 °C for 1 h. The hydrolytic stability test of
membrane samples was performed by treating the membranes in deionized
water at 140 °C for 24 h. Percentage loss in weight or IEC of
the membrane sample after the treatment was considered as a suitable
criterion to judge the oxidative and hydrolytic stability of the membrane
sample in the given environment.

Burst strength, the minimum
pressure (kg cm–2) required to rupture the membrane,
was measured by a burst tester machine (Test Techno Consultant, Vadodara,
Gujarat, India; model 807 DMP).

4.8 Current–Voltage
Curves and ED Experiments
For the estimation of limiting
current density (Ilim), current–voltage
(i–V) curves were recorded
in the two-compartment membrane
(Figure S2, Supporting Information) in
equilibration with 0.10 M NaCl solution.45 The effective membrane area was 25 cm2. In steps, current
was applied using precious metal oxide (titanium, ruthenium, and platinum)
coated TiO2 sheets of 6.0 mm thickness, obtained from Titanium
Tantalum Products (TITAN, Chennai, India). The resultant potential
across the membrane was measured by a digital multimeter (millivolt)
with the help of salt bridges and saturated calomel electrodes.18

A laboratory-scale ED unit with 10 cell
pairs of ion-exchange membranes (cation-exchange membrane: SPEEK/PGO,
and anion-exchange membrane (AEM): ASV supplied by Selemion, Japan)
of 100 cm2 effective membrane area was fabricated (Figure 10). Properties of
AEM are included in Table S1 (Supporting
Information). There were four compartments in
the ED unit, namely, two electrode wash (EW) compartments, one concentrated
stream (CS) compartment, and one desalinated stream (DS) compartment.
A parallel-cum-series flow pattern was adopted to monitor the flow
across each compartment. Na2SO4 solution (0.10
M) was recirculated in both EW compartments. Initially, brackish water
(4000 ppm) was fed into DS and CS compartments using peristaltic pumps
in a continuous mode with a constant flow rate (0.001 m3 h–1). Precious metal oxide (titanium, ruthenium,
and platinum) coated TiO2 sheets of 6.0 mm thickness, obtained
from Titanium Tantalum Products (TITAN, Chennai, India), were used
as the cathode and anode. ED experiments were performed under the
influence of a constant applied current using a direct current power
supply (Aplab India, model lL 1285), and the resultant potential across
the electrodes was measured by a digital multimeter. During water
desalination, salt concentration and pH of different streams were
regularly monitored.

cell pairs)

interfaces facing DS) for the fast water desalination and production
of alkaline water (pH: ∼8.0).
