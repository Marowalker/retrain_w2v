Acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives
with various polyester side-chain
lengths were synthesized to investigate the effect of branching on
phase separation and polymer mechanical performance. The polyester
macromonomers (MMs) were produced through ring-opening co-polymerizations
of l-lactide (l-LA) and ε-caprolactone (ε-CL)
initiated with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), which provides
the polyester chains with terminal vinyl groups. By varying the HEMA
content, a range of MM chain lengths constructed from L10C4 (five l-LA and four ε-CL units) to L100C40 were obtained at a constant monomer mole
ratio. Copolymerization of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and acrylic acid
with these MMs at constant mass composition provided a series of comb
copolymers consisting of acrylic backbones with polyester branches
of various chain lengths. Characterization of thin films cast from
the polymers using thermal analysis and scanning probe microscopy
showed a transition from a homogeneous phase to the formation of distinct
microphases with increasing branching chain lengths. Rheological analysis
of the linear viscoelastic responses was also used through small-amplitude
oscillatory shear, and dynamic master curves were constructed by time–temperature
superposition. The rheological data were also consistent with phase
separation for the longer side-chain lengths of L50C20 and L100C40. The extra elastic contribution
at low frequency and the temperature dependence of aT both show obviously effect of separated phases. Performance
testing of polymer films showed that the chain extension resulted
in a significant increase in both peel strength and shear resistance,
which was accompanied by a modest decrease in film tackiness. The
results demonstrate that tailoring branch chain structures provide
a promising means for controlling the properties of the high-biomass
content adhesive polymers.

Introduction
In recent years, there
has been a great interest in the development
of sustainable materials generated using renewable biomass. Efforts
to replace monomers derived from fossil fuels are especially prevalent
in the area of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA).1,2 Various
renewable materials have been used as wholly or in-part substitutes
for PSA components, including starch,3 polymerized
soybean oil,4−6 and monomers, such as l-lactide (l-LA), isosorbide, and menthyl acrylate.7−9 Amongst the more promising
approaches is the generation of acrylic hybrid polymers. Previously,
the synthesis, characterization, and performance of adhesive polymers
possessing acrylic-based backbones and high-polyester-content short
branches were reviewed.1,2 The short branches are introduced
during synthesis as macromonomers (MMs) composed of acrylic-capped l-LA and ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) linear chain structures.
Although such copolymers tend not to possess adhesive characteristics,10,11 it was shown that the ratio between MM components could be used
to control physical properties and important adhesive performance
characteristics of the hybrid polymers. The role played by MM length
in determining properties and the tendency of the lactide-based components
to segregate are not evident. Such microstructural details are likely
central to the successful application of these materials.

The
performance of a PSA is commonly gauged with three mechanical
tests; tack force (tack), peel strength (peel), and shear resistance
time (shear).12 As would be expected, changes
that enhance cohesive strength of an adhesive film concurrently reduce
its ability to flow and wet surfaces, i.e., shear resistance tends
to be inversely related to both tack and peel performance. All performance
properties are influenced by characteristics of the adhesive polymer,
such as its molecular weight, monomer ratio, and monomer chain structure,
as well as microstructure.13,14 Also, important in
determining adhesive performance is the degree of cross-linking present,
both chemical and physical.15−20

The influence of physical cross-linking is apparent in thermoplastic
or hotmelt PSA. Traditional hotmelt is primarily composed of base
polymer, tackifying resin, and processing oil (plasticizer). Base
polymers are commonly block copolymers consisting of isoprene (I)
or butadiene (B) in combination with styrene (S), such as the triblock
copolymers SIS and SBS. The microphase separation of block components
forms a repeating nanostructure consisting of hard glassy PS regions,
which are often described as physical cross-links, and soft rubbery
PI or PB regions. These microphases can be targeted with additives
such as tackifying resin or diblock copolymer, allowing for the manipulation
of the microstructure and adhesive properties.21−26 The adhesive polymers discussed in this work are branched copolymers.
The use of pendant groups that are distinctly different (chemically
or structurally) from the backbone provides another means for achieving
novel property combinations.27−29 Previously, it was demonstrated
that adhesive properties could be finely tuned through changes in
low-molecular-weight pendant group compositions. Extending these chains
produces long side chains and the possible aggregation of microstructures,
as found for linear block copolymers.

Given that the performance
of PSA is dependent on the balance between
elastic and viscous behavior, great insights are provided through
their rheological characterization. Rheological properties of branched
copolymers can be tailored by changing the side-chain length and composition.
This is demonstrated primarily in the form of rheological data collected
using small-amplitude oscillatory shear, an approach that has proven
to be quite useful in detecting such effects due to its high sensitivity
in the linear viscoelastic region.30 The
viscoelastic properties of branched polymer melts are often described
through various structural models, such as bottlebrushes,31 combs,32,33 stars,34,35 and so on. Bottlebrush polymers are those possessing a high density
of branches, resulting in higher rigidities compared to those of linear
polymers of similar molecular weights. The dynamic mechanical behavior
of such polymers is governed by relaxation modes for both the arms
and backbone,31,36 with the high-frequency behavior
being dominated by the shorter relaxations of the arms and low-frequency
behavior by the longer relaxations of the backbone. If the arm and
backbone are both unentangled, their relaxation spectra are similar
to the Rouse relaxation spectrum.31 For
systems with entangled arms and backbone, two rubbery plateaus can
be found in the plots of dynamic storage moduli (G′).37 For the rheological analysis
of phase-separated systems, G′ values increase
at low frequencies due to the extra elastic contribution of separated
phases. The phase separation is often confirmed using the combination
of rheological data, microscopy, and thermal analysis.38,39

It is well documented that a low elastic modulus is required
for
a polymer to demonstrate self-adhesive behavior, e.g., the Dahlquist
criterion.40 This can be attained by increasing
entanglement molecular weight (Me) or
lowering chain entanglement density. Introducing comb or bottlebrush
structures in PSA is expected to increase Me. However, PSA with a low elastic modulus often possesses poor peel
performance. Peel strength tends to correlate with the loss modulus
(G″), which is indicative of enhanced energy
dissipation along with strain hardening. Increasing G″ can be accomplished by broadening the glass transition temperature
(Tg) range of a PSA or increasing its
degree of cross-linking, which also enhances the creep resistance.
The drawback of chemical cross-linking is that it strongly impacts
the tack performance of PSA.

Herein, the comb PSA having acrylic
backbones and copolyester MM
side chains is focused. A range of MMs with various chain lengths
were used at a constant weight composition in the overall polymeric
structures to examine the influence of branching on aggregational,
rheological, and mechanical properties of the polymers. It was expected
that the polyester MMs would have a poor compatibility with the acrylic
backbone above their Mes,41 leading to physical cross-linking/ phase separation. Given
that shorter block lengths are more favorable for phase separation,42 free-radical copolymerization of acrylates and
copolyester MMs was used to produce the PSA with broad molecular weight
distribution (Đ). It was expected that the
low Me (for tack), broad Tg (for peel), and physical cross-linking (for peel and
shear) of the PSA would provide good adhesive performance. As will
be discussed, the results indicate that increasing the length of such
pendent branch structures provides for a significant enhancement of
adhesive polymer properties and the covalent linking of immiscible
molecular chains to the backbone may provide greater stability and
control over morphology and performance compared with blended and
blocky materials.43,44

Experimental Section
Materials
Catalyst tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, Sn(Oct)2, (>95%),
2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile), AIBN
(>98%), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, HEMA, (>97%), ε-CL
(>97%),
acrylic monomers 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2-EHA), acrylic acid (AA),
methyl acrylate (MA), and solvents (ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. l-LA (>99%) was generously
provided by Shenzhen Bright China Industrial Co., Ltd. Deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3) used to dissolve MMs and generated copolymers
for 1H and 13C NMR analysis was purchased from
J&K Chemicals.

Synthesis of MMs and Branched Copolymers
Macromonomers
of various chain lengths were synthesized from HEMA, l-LA,
and ε-CL. The l-LA and ε-CL were combined at
a constant molar ratio of 5:4, respectively, for various ratios of
HEMA, mechanically stirred, and heated to 140 °C under a N2 atmosphere. Sn(Oct)2 (0.5 mol % based on monomer)
was then introduced through a septum with a syringe to initiate polymerizations.
Reactions were maintained at 140 °C for 4–6 h under constant
mechanical stirring, with required reaction times increasing with
lower HEMA molar ratios (i.e., larger MM chain lengths). Products
were allowed to cool to ambient temperature prior to characterization
and use. For the synthesis of the acrylic polymer, 2-EHA and AA were
mixed with ethyl acetate to make a 50 wt % solution and then introduced
into a round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical mixer. The
solution was purged with N2 for 5 min and immersed in a
65 °C oil bath. Polymerization was initiated by charging AIBN
dissolved in 2 mL of ethyl acetate. After 10 min, the MM ethyl acetate
solution (20 wt %) was added dropwise within 5 h. The polymerization
was continued for additional 3–6 h after charging all MM. Upon
completion, products were transferred to a second vessel and cooled
to ambient temperature. Prior to characterization, polymerization
products were precipitated with methanol and redissolved in ethyl
acetate twice to remove the unreactive monomers and dried under vacuum
at 30 °C for 40 h.

Characterization of MMs and Graft Copolymers
1H and 13C NMR measurements were made using
a Bruker Advance
2B to determine monomer conversions and MM sequential structures,
respectively. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions
of copolymers were characterized with gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) using a Waters 1525/2414 GPC equipped with waters styragel HR
columns and a differential refractive index detector. Measurements
were made at a constant temperature of 30 °C using tetrahydrofuran
as the eluent at a flow rate 1.0 mL/min. Reported values are relative
to PS standards. Glass transition temperatures Tg were gauged on a TA Instruments Q200 differential scanning
calorimeter. Subsequent to thermal conditioning, samples were heated
at a rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen environment over a temperature
range of −75–150 °C to locate transitions.

Surface morphologies of polymer samples were characterized using
a Bruker Multimode 8 scanning probe microscope (SPM). Films of approximately
25 μm thickness were spin-coated onto silicon wafers and conditioned
for 24 h at 23 °C prior to testing. The SPM images were collected
in tapping mode under ambient conditions. The linear viscosity rheological
properties of all samples were gauged using a HAAKE RS6000 Rotational
Rheometer equipped with 20 mm diameter parallel plates. Circular samples
of approximately 1 mm thickness were obtained, filling a Teflon mold
with the polymer dissolved in ethyl acetate and evaporating the solvent
slowly. Frequency sweeps were carried out over a range of 0.01–40
Hz in oscillatory shear at a strain of 1% for a constant-temperature
range of 25–105 °C at intervals of 20 °C.

Mechanical
performance tests were carried out on films generated
by dissolving polymers in ethyl acetate, coating the solutions on
poly(ethylene terephthalate) films using a wire-wound drawdown rod,
and drying films under ambient conditions. Samples of each film were
cut and weighed to confirm coating weights of 25 ± 3 g/m2 (≈1 mil). Tack force, peel strength, and shear holding
times were measured according to ASTM standards, including ASTM D6195-03,
ASTM D903-98, and ASTM D6463/D6463M-06. Both tack and peel testing
were carried out with a Zwick/Roell Z020 Materials Testing Machine.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of MMs and Graft Copolymers
All MMs were
generated with the same molar ratio of l-LA to ε-CL
of 5:4 but with different HEMA contents, which produced a range of
chain lengths, including the structures L10C4, L20C8, L50C20, and
L100C40. The synthesis of MMs is shown in Scheme 1.

The favorable
comparisons between compositions determined with 1H NMR
analysis and those based on feed ratios indicate that
reaction conditions were sufficient to provide for complete conversion
of monomers. The MMs produced with double bonds were nearly 100% for
most structures but decreased slightly for the largest MMs. This is
believed to be due to the longer reaction times required for the longest
two MMs, which provided for some self-polymerization of double bonds.
The Mn values determined using 1H NMR were nearly identical to target values and ranged from 1.42
to 12.47 kg/mol. The Mn values determined
using GPC were different from the theoretical values, which can be
attributed to the use of PS standards as references. The GPC-determined Đ values were similar for all four MM samples, ranging
from 1.65 to 1.76. The entanglement molecular weight Me for the polyester MMs can be estimated from values for
PLLA (Me(PLLA)) and PCL (Me(PCL)) as41 1  where nPLLA, nPCL, and ntotal represent
the mole numbers of PLLA, PCL, and the total, respectively. Using eq 1, a value of 6600 g/mol
is obtained, indicating that only PL100C40 may participate in chain entanglement.

All MMs were found to possess a glass transition region and no
melting transition when analyzed using DSC. Although homopolymers
of both l-LA and ε-CL are crystalline, the random copolymer
does not appear to form a crystalline phase at the molar ratio of
5:4. Table 1 shows
a dependency between Tg and MM chain length
with values increasing by more than 15 °C, moving from the smallest
to the largest MM. It is expected that Tg is inversely related to Mn,45 and a plot of Tg values against the inverse of Mn,NMR values is fit accurately with the equation for a line (R2 > 0.97, Figure S4). As
reported
previously, l-LA has a greater reactivity than that of ε-CL
when Sn(Oct)2 is used to catalyze the reaction.46,47 Thus, the reaction would be expected to produce copolymer chains
composed of rich lactidyl units close to the MM head and terminated
by a rich caproyl unit sequence. However, the presence of transesterification
reactions results in a more random distribution of repeat units along
the chain structure. Larger MMs require longer reaction times, which
should provide for a greater influence on transesterification. Measurements
made using 13C NMR show that the MMs L50C20 and L100C40 did tend to possess a
more random distribution of lactidyl and caproyl units along the MM
chains when compared to those of L20C8 and L10C4. However, the differences are small.

The polyester branched acrylic copolymers were synthesized from
2-EHA, AA, and MM at a weight-based feed ratio of 61:6:33, as shown
in Scheme 1. For comparison,
an acrylic polymer is also produced by replacing MM with methyl MA
at the same feed ratio. The properties for the polymers are summarized
in Table 2. The different
reaction runs to produce these polymers are indicated by the number
of lactidyl units that compose the MMs. For example, the reaction
run is indicated as PL10C4 when the L10C4 MM acts as the hard monomer
to produce the polyester branch copolymer.

f Determined by DSC.

With
the exception of 2-EHA, monomers introduced, including MMs,
were completely consumed in copolymerization reactions. Slightly lower
conversion of 2-EHA is presumed to be due to its lower reactivity
than that of methacrylic,47 and the conversion
was further decreased with increasing MM chain length. From Table 2, it can be seen that
the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the copolymers increased when the MM was substituted for MA.
Values for Mw as well as Đ increased as the MM chain length was extended. The broad molecular
weight distributions in PL50C20 and PL100C40 are attributed to the difference in relative reactivities
of acrylates and MMs.48,49 Their 1H NMR spectra,
DSC thermograms, and GPC traces are shown in Figures S5–S7.

Table 2 lists Tg values for the
copolymers. The substitution
of MA (Tg of 9 °C) with the L10C4 MM (Tg of −31.6
°C) resulted in a relatively large decrease in Tg from about −24 to −48 °C. For the
much longer L20C8 MM (Tg of −24.8 °C), this gap shrank to less than 6
°C. For the two largest MMs, L50C20, and
L100C40, the DSC thermal scans changed significantly
with two Tg values being observed. The
lower Tg value is thought to be associated
with MM-poor resin phase and the higher transition with the polyester
MM rich phase, which is attributed to a lower reactivity of the MMs
with increasing chain length. The gap between Tg values expanded by more than 10 °C in moving from the
L50C20 to the L100C40 MM.
The results not only indicate a poor compatibility between the acrylic
and lactide-based phases but also show that a critical chain length
for the polyester MM is required to provide a great enough immiscibility
to induce phase separation. This immiscibility then increased as the
chain length of the MM was increased further. The presence of phase
separation is likely an advantage for adhesive materials. Such polymers
can reach different degrees of relaxation over a wide range of temperatures,50 and the presence of two phases provides more
options to manipulate properties with additives.

SPM images
for films cast with the graft acrylic copolymers are
shown in Figure S8. It is apparent that
the polymer morphology changed with MM chain length, although some
dots and parallel lines appear in the images owing to the use of tapping
mode. The most evident distinction is between polymers PL10C4 and PL20C8 (Figure S8a,b) and polymers PL50C20 and PL100C40 (Figure S8c,d), with the latter pair
with the longer chain MMs clearly demonstrating phase separation.
The aggregation degree of each phase is not well-distributed due to
the traditional free-radical copolymerization, leading to broad MM
composition distribution in copolymers. Their phase images indicate
the presence of a hard phase (light color) presumed to be aggregated
polyester-rich regions surrounded by a softer matrix (dark color),
which is likely the acrylic-rich phase.

Influence of MM Chain Length
on Linear Viscoelasticity
Shear rheology in the linear viscoelastic
region of a polymer is
quite sensitive to changes in microstructure.51−54 This approach is also used to
characterize the branched acrylic copolymers. For the PL10C4 and PL20C8 polymers, normal stress changed
rapidly for temperatures above 65 °C, resulting in the unreliable
data. Thus, measurements for these samples were made below this temperature.

The plots of complex viscosity (η*) versus frequency (f) for the different graft copolymers are shown in Figure S9. The master curves (reference temperature
25 °C) for the complex viscosities are shown in Figure 1. PL10C4 and PL20C8 start to show the transition from the Newtonian
to non-Newtonian region under 10–2 Hz. However,
the two samples possessing longer branches demonstrated non-Newtonian
behavior at very low frequencies (10–6 Hz). Throughout
the high-frequency region, the slopes of all samples are similar (i.e.,
−1/2) and close to that of the Rouse model in the intermediate
frequency region, indicating that chain entanglement is not substantial.
However, at low frequencies, the plot shows a clear distinction in
behaviors for the copolymers due to the different MM chain lengths.

Figure 1 Master
curve of complex viscosity of copolymers with different
branch lengths generated using a reference temperature of 25 °C
and the aT from the low-frequency fit
of G′.

It has been found that molecular weight distribution and
branch
chain length affect the terminal frequency rheological properties
and thus the zero shear viscosity, owing to the introduction of a
long relaxation time component.30 The molecular
weight distributions changed from 3.3 to 12.7 for linear low-density
polyethylenes having similar molecular weight, resulting in the increase
of zero shear viscosities, but the increment is within 1 order of
magnitude.56 From Figure 1, the complex viscosity of 3.5 × 107 Pa·s can be observed for PL50C20 at aT × f of 2.8 × 10–6 Hz, where the Newtonian
transition zone has not been reached yet. The fitting of the data
using the Carreau–Yasuda55 equation provides a zero shear viscosity value
for PL20C8 (3.8
× 105 Pa·s) that is about twice that of PL10C4 (1.7 × 105 Pa·s). Comparing the complex viscosity of 3.5 ×
107 Pa·s for PL50C20 before reaching the Newtonian transition zone
with the zero shear viscosity of 3.8 × 105 Pa·s
for PL20C8, such
a substantial viscosity difference cannot be attributed to the molecular
weight distribution effect only.

From the G′ master curves for the copolymer
samples (Figure 2),
it can be seen that at high frequency, all of the curves showed a
similar frequency dependency close to that expected from the bottlebrush
Rouse model. The greatest G′ value at high
frequency is for PL100C40. There is a great difference in the rheological behavior in
the low-frequency region due to differences in phase separation and
thus physical cross-linking. For the two shorter chain lengths, the
increase of the molecular weight produces terminal relaxation time
increases and the curve moves toward low frequency. Although the molecular
weight of PL50C20 is lower than that of PL20C8, it still shows a longer relaxation time. Moreover,
the slope of the low-frequency range from scale 2 of PL20C8 to scale 0.5 of PL50C20 indicates the existence of
an additional relaxation mechanism, namely, the contribution of phase
separation morphology. For the phase-separated samples, the slope
of PL50C20 at low
frequency is very close to 0.5, similar to the scale of block copolymer
lamellar phase separation, whereas the scale of PL100C40 is 0.2, which is between
the scale of columnar phase and globular phase.61,62 Therefore, the two samples with longer side chains were mainly influenced
by phase separation.

Figure 2 Master curves of G′ for the copolymers
with different branch lengths at the reference temperature of 25 °C. aT is determined from the superposition of G′ values at low frequency by horizontal shift.

The log–log plots of G′ and G″ as a function of
frequency for different graft
copolymers are shown in Figure S10. The
master curves for G′ and G″ are shown in Figure 3. Moduli from different temperatures can be superposed well. PL10C4 and PL20C8 displayed the terminal slopes
of G′ and G″ as 2
and 1, respectively. At high frequency, moduli values nearly overlap
with slopes of 0.5. The result is similar to the reported result on
the Rouse model of bottlebrush systems.57 Although the Me of backbone (2-EHA)
is about 37.4 kg/mol,58 the molecular weight
of the shortest system, PL10C4, is about 2.45 times this, which means in theory, each
system can entangle. However, the backbone entanglement is suppressed
due to the introduction of branching, which increases its chain rigidity.
Also, the average molecular weights between two branching points of
the copolymers range from 6.6 to 25 kg/mol, which are lower than those
of Me, and thus the copolymers are too
small to provide for entanglement.32,60 Thus, PL10C4 and PL20C8 likely possess bottlebrush
rheological behavior and the scaling exponent indicates no phase separation.
Furthermore, the backbone of PL50C20 is shorter than that of PL20C8, whereas the arm length is much
longer, indicating entanglement of the backbone of PL50C20 is not substantial. For PL100C40, although the
backbone is longer than that of PL20C8, the much longer arm also suppresses backbone
entanglement.

at the
reference temperature of 25 °C in (a–c) and master curves
for L100C40 at the reference temperature of
13.8 °C in (d). aT of PL50C20 and PL100C40 are determined from the superposition
of G′ values at low frequency by horizontal
shift. The solid markers indicate G′ values,
whereas the open markers indicate G″ values.

When the branch length was extended
to L50C20, the low-frequency behaviors of G′ and G″ begin to change
significantly from those for the
shorter branch chain length polymers. Plots of the moduli overlap
with a slope of 0.5, and it appears that the molecule chain is going
to relax as with the bottlebrush Rouse model behavior at frequency
lower than 10–6 Hz. However, the molecular weight
of PL50C20 is lower
than that of PL20C8 and the terminal relaxation of the bottlebrush molecular chain should
appear at a comparable time scale as that of PL20C8 (∼10–2 Hz) even when PL50C20 has longer side
chains. Therefore, the relaxation appears to be at least 104 times slower
than the terminal relaxation of PL20C8 and cannot be ascribed to the molecular relaxation.
In other words, there must be an extra elastic contribution to the G′ value.59,63

For the PL100C40 system, the elastic
character (G′ > G″)
at low frequency is obviously different from
that demonstrated by the other samples. Since the branch length is
about twice the Me, it is necessary to
elucidate the role of arm relaxation. For the bottlebrush polymer
having a side-chain length shorter than the backbone, the relaxation
of side chains normally occurs before the relaxation of the backbone
and a plateau at high frequency can be observed if entangled.60 Since the Tg of
L100C40 is −15.7 °C while the higher Tg of PL100C40 is −4.5 °C, the reference temperature
of the master curve for L100C40 was set at 13.8
°C when 25 °C is selected as the reference for PL100C40 (Figure 3d), which is to secure the comparison of
both samples at the same friction state. Rouse-like relaxation behavior
with terminal relaxation appears. Therefore, the relaxation of the
whole bottlebrush molecule could be slightly slower than that of PL20C8 due to the difference
in molecular weights. It indicated that the contribution of molecular
relaxation was mainly covered by the contribution of phase separation.

If there is phase separation, it would be expected that moduli
from different temperatures cannot superpose well (Figure 3c,d). The failure of time–temperature
superposition indicates existence of at least two different relaxation
processes (molecular relaxation and domain relaxation) with different
temperature dependencies. To illustrate in a quantitative manner,
we could determine the shift factor aT from the superposition of G′ value under
low frequency as aT(G′) and aT from superposition of G″ value under high frequency as aT(G″). Comparing the temperature
dependence of aT of copolymers with different
branching lengths under high and low frequencies (Figure 4), aT(G″) of PL50C20 and PL100C40 have similar tendency to that of PL10C4 and PL20C8, indicating a similar molecular
relaxation process at a high-frequency regime. However, aT(G′) curve of PL50C20 and PL100C40 obviously deviated from the curve
of aT(G″). Such
behavior clearly illustrates two different kinds of relaxation process
due to the phase separation and chain relaxation, respectively.

Effects of MM Chain Length
on Mechanical Properties
The adhesive performance properties
of the graft copolymer samples
are shown in Figure 5. A change in mechanical properties from the conventional MA-containing
copolymer to those generated with the MMs was evident. It can also
be seen that tack, peel, and shear results were dependent on the chain
lengths of MMs. This is an interesting result given that the copolymers
contain the same MM content and composition overall. Although the
copolymers were previously split into two distinct groupings, on the
basis of phase separation, there was no clear distinction in performance
between these groups. The sharp increase in peel and shear for PL100C40 is likely due
to the large increase in chain length for this sample relative to
that of the others. A promising finding is that tack did not decrease
with increasing shear for PL50C20 and PL100C40. Both the peel and shear performance of the copolymers were
quite good. However, the tack value would be considered a bit low
by commercial adhesive standards. The composition of the MMs can be
modified to enhance tack. However, this is at the expense of cohesive
strength and results in a decrease of shear performance. The relatively
small decrease in tack associated with moving from the shorter MMs
to the longer forms, which possessed high cohesive strengths, appears
to provide an opportunity to increase tack while maintaining good
properties overall. Thus, these graft copolymers provide a variety
of means to tailor adhesive properties through MM and backbone composition,
MM length structure, and use of additives. This last approach is likely
to be greatly enhanced when MM chain lengths are sufficiently long,
which promotes phase segregation.

Figure 5 Performance properties including tack
force, peel strength, and
shear resistance for graft copolymers.

Given that PSA performance is typically governed to a greater
extent
by bulk viscoelastic properties rather than surface energy, great
insights on the observed adhesive properties can be gleaned from the
rheological data.12,64 The Dahlquist criterion was one
the earliest connections between rheological data and performance.40 A more elaborate analysis is the Chang window,
which identifies characteristic frequencies associated with various
processes a PSA undergoes (e.g., tack, peel, and shear testing)65 and uses the dynamic moduli as axes to produce
a performance map useful in product design.66 Chu provided an empirical connection between performance properties
and rheology data based for resins, tackifying resins, and PSA.67 It is this analysis that provides useful insights
on the graft copolymers studied here.

Chu concluded that the G′ and Tg at the application
temperature are the most important
parameters in determining performance. For tape PSAs, a G′ range of 50–200 kPa and a Tg range of −15–10 °C is suggested. For label
PSAs, ranges of 20–80 kPa and −30 to −10 °C
are suggested for G′ and Tg, respectively. The use of Tg values is based on their assignment as the maximum in the tan δ
temperature sweep. Temperature sweeps were carried out at a frequency
of 10 rad/s or about 1.6 Hz. It is expected that the Tg values measured via DMA at this frequency will likely
be slightly higher than those found with DSC. Table 3 provides G′ and G″ at 25 °C for a variety of frequencies for
the copolymers. It can be seen that for a frequency of 1.6 Hz, all G′ values for the copolymers were within the suggested
range. For the short-chain MM copolymers, Tg values were slightly low, whereas for the longer MMs, two Tg values were obtained (see Table 2).

Table 3 Comparison
of Storage Moduli at Different
Frequencies for Graft Copolymers at 25 °C
 	G′ (kPa)	G″ (kPa)	 	
run	0.016 Hz	1.6 Hz	16 Hz		
PL10C4	5.19	37.99	103	19.8	
PL20C8	8.66	51.93	139	16.0	
PL50C20	18.7	56.71	173	9.25	
PL100C40	24.1	104.76	296	12.3	
Another empirical relationship suggested by Chu is based on the
observation that a lower G′ is desired at
low frequencies for better shear resistance, whereas a higher value
is desired at higher frequencies to promote better peel results. As
discussed earlier, G′ increases in a regular
fashion, so Chu uses the value at 0.016 Hz (0.1 rad/s) as a gauge
of its low-frequency value in combination with the ratio of G″ value at 16 Hz and G′
at 0.016 Hz as a gauge of how quickly values rise as the frequency
is increased. From a large sample set, it was proposed that PSAs with
20 kPa < G′0.016 Hz <
40 kPa and 5 <  < 300 possess a good balance of performance
properties. It is interesting that only PL100C40 meets these criteria. It is likely
that the long side chain is directly responsible for this result,
which bolsters the case that the high-biomass content copolymers that
were found to demonstrate good adhesive properties can be further
enhanced through the graft length and phase separation.

Conclusions
The work reviewed above clearly shows that polyester branch chain
length governed a large part of the properties of the generated hybrid
acrylic polymers. Thermal analysis identified a split of a single
glass transition into two second-order transitions when the L50C20 or L100C20 MM replaced
L20C8 or L10C4 at the
same mass fraction in the synthesis. The thermal separation between
the transitions grew significantly larger when L100C40 was used as the MM. The behavior indicates the likely formation
of acrylic and polyester phases, which were demonstrated visually
in SPM phase images. Rheological analysis of the linear viscoelastic
responses was also used through small-amplitude oscillatory shear,
and dynamic master curves were constructed by time–temperature
superposition. The data indicate that all graft copolymers underwent
the bottlebrush Rouse-like behavior and the copolymers containing
the L50C20 or L100C40 MM
clearly demonstrated phase separation. It is shown that with the change
of the side-chain length, different types of phase separation occur
and enhance the mechanical properties of the systems.

The effect
on adhesive performance is expected to be twofold. First,
phase separation produced a low Tg MM-poor
phase and a high Tg polyester-rich phase.
The combination provided a soft polymer that could retain cohesive
strength. This is believed to be exemplified by the retention of tack
for the copolymer containing the L100C40 MM,
which demonstrated the highest shear values. Furthermore, the separation
into immiscible microphases provides a means to manipulate transitions
and properties separately, allowing the performance of such species
to be further modified with chemical additives (e.g., tackifying resin).
Second, the presence of relatively long branches and phase separation
are believed to enhance the cohesive strength of the copolymer, which
increased both its peel and shear performance. The results of performance
testing were consistent with this assertion. The most evident connection
is that between the elastic contribution of phase separation observed
for the copolymer containing the L100C40 MM
and its measured shear resistance. The time reported is that for the
adhesive to flow from the surface resulting in adhesive bond failure.
Increasing side-chain length will extend the time required for such
processes.

It should be noted here that no effort is made to
optimize the
performance of the polymers. Previously, it is demonstrated that physical
and performance properties of such polymers were strongly dependent
on MM composition. The results presented here demonstrated that MM
chain length provided another means to manipulate properties. The
combination of these along with the use of additives for targeting-separated
microphases provides a powerful set of tools for tailoring the performance
of materials utilizing the graft copolymers.
