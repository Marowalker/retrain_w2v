A catalytic method for the synthesis
of substituted fluoranthenes
that operates via tandem Suzuki–Miyaura and intramolecular
C–H arylation reactions is reported. The overall reaction sequence
works effectively with homogeneous catalysis using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as well as heterogeneous catalysis using reduced graphene
oxide (rGO)-CuPd nanocatalysts with low catalyst loadings. High functional
group tolerance is observed under both catalytic conditions where
arylboronic acids and esters having electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
substituents afforded fluoranthene products in good yields (up to
78%). Moreover, the rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts are demonstrated to be
reusable by preserving almost 90% of their initial activity after
the third cycle.

Introduction
Fluoranthenes represent
an important subclass of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons with a broad range of attractive applications.1 A number of fungal natural products have a fluoranthene
core in their structures, such as hortein2a (1) and daldinone E2b (2), among others, some of which exhibit important biological
activities (Figure 1).2 Fluoranthenes have also found widespread
applications in materials science, particularly in the area of organic
electronics.3 For instance, FLUN-550 (3) was introduced by Goel, Mitra, and co-workers in 2014 as
a fluoranthene-based fluorescent probe for selective staining of intracellular
lipid droplets.4 Structurally related diacenaphthylene-fused
benzodithiophenes (4) have recently been developed by
Yang, Hartl, Li, and co-workers, and their field-effect mobilities
have been investigated (Figure 1).5

Figure 1 Examples of important
fluoranthene analogues.

Among the methods available for the synthesis and derivatization
of fluoranthenes, Diels–Alder reaction has been the most commonly
utilized method,3a−3c,4,6 whereas transition-metal-catalyzed reactions and various other cyclization
strategies have also been employed.3d,5,7 In 2009, Quimby and Scott reported an effective method
for the synthesis of fluoranthenes starting from 1,8-dichloronaphthalenes
and arylboronic acids in the presence of a homogeneous Pd catalyst.8 However, this reaction requires high catalyst
loading (20 mol % Pd2(dba)3) and high reaction
temperatures (155–175 °C). Total synthesis of the natural
product benzo[j]fluoranthene-4,9-diol was accomplished
by Dallavalle and co-workers in 2013 wherein the fluoranthene core
was assembled by a McMurry ring closure.9 More recently, Manabe and co-workers developed an elegant Pd-catalyzed
method that enables the three-step synthesis of fluoranthenes via
inter- and intramolecular C–H arylation reactions.10 During the course of our studies on 1,8-diarylnaphthalenes,
we have observed that monoaryl as well as symmetrical and unsymmetrical
diarylnaphthalenes could be obtained selectively via Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction using a tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (Pd(PPh3)4) catalyst starting from 1,8-diiodonaphthalene
(5). On the other hand, using a more active Pd catalyst,
Pd(dppf)Cl2 led to the formation of significant amounts
of fluoranthene side products, which prompted us to investigate this
transformation in detail. Herein, we report a highly effective method
for the synthesis of substituted fluoranthenes that can operate under
both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic conditions.

Results and Discussion
We initiated our study by examining the reaction between 1,8-diiodonaphthalene
(5) and 4-fluorophenylboronic acid (6a)
in the presence of homogeneous Pd catalysts (Table 1). As mentioned above, the Suzuki–Miyaura
monoarylation product was obtained as the major product when Pd(PPh3)4 was used as the catalyst with no formation of
fluoranthene 6b (entry 1). Pleasingly, Pd(dppf)Cl2 proved to be an effective catalyst for the desired transformation
when used in 5 mol % catalyst loading. Among the carbonate and acetate
bases screened, KOAc gave the highest yield of fluoranthene 6b in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 90 °C (71%, entries
2–6). Inferior results were obtained when KOtBu, CsF, and NaOH were examined as bases (entries 7–9).
With KOAc as the optimal base, we then performed a solvent screening.
Whereas dimethylformamide (DMF) was completely ineffective under the
same reaction conditions (entry 10), CH3CN, dioxane, and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) afforded the
desired product 6b, albeit in lower yields (31, 48, and
38%, respectively, entries 11–13). Finally, Pd(OAc)2/PtBu3·HBF4 and Pd2(dba)3/PtBu3·HBF4 combinations were found be catalytically
less active compared to Pd(dppf)Cl2 (entries 14 and 15).

Having successfully optimized the fluoranthene synthesis in the
presence of homogeneous palladium catalysts, we then turned our attention
to the utilization of a heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation,
considering the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts over homogeneous
ones. As the classical heterogeneous catalysts have limited surface
area resulting in low activity, nanocatalysts emerged as highly efficient
catalysts for various organic reactions in recent years owing to their
high surface-to-volume ratio.11 In this
respect, Metin research group has demonstrated that bimetallic Pd
nanoparticles (NPs) assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were
highly efficient catalysts in a variety of organic transformations;12 especially, rGO-assembled CuPd alloy NPs (rGO-CuPd)
were shown to be highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts in Sonogashira
cross-coupling reactions.12a By the motivation
of these promising results, we selected the rGO-CuPd nanocatalyst
as a heterogeneous catalyst to be tested in this transformation.13 We first conducted optimization experiments
depending on various parameters in the presence of the rGO-CuPd nanocatalyst
(Table 2). As can be
seen in Table 2, the
rGO-CuPd nanocatalyst provided the highest yield by the use of NaOAc
as a base and DMSO/H2O (v/v = 10:1) mixture as a solvent
at 120 °C (62%, entry 3). It is worth mentioning that among all
tested alloy compositions, the rGO-CuPd catalyst provided the highest
yield under the optimized conditions (Table 2, entries 12 and 13). Moreover, the rGO-CuPd
nanocatalyst provided a much higher yield than the commercially available
Pd/C catalyst (entry 8) and comparable to that of the homogeneous
catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example
of a comparison of the performances of a homogeneous and a heterogeneous
catalyst in C–H arylation reactions.

With the optimized conditions in
hand, we next investigated the
scope of the fluoranthene synthesis reaction under both the homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic conditions (Table 3). As mentioned above, fluoranthene product 6b was obtained in 71 and 62% yields using methods A and B,
respectively (entry 1). The reaction tolerates the presence of nitrile,
amide, and ketone groups, affording fluoranthene products 7b, 8b, and 9b in good yields under both
conditions (entries 2–4). Whereas −CO2Me-containing
fluoranthene 10b was isolated in 78% yield with method
A, method B gave a lower yield (36%, entry 5). 4- and 3-NO2-substituted boronic acids 11a and 12a both
gave the same fluoranthene product 11b in good yields
(entries 6 and 7, respectively). The complete regioselectivity observed
with substrate 12a is noteworthy to mention. Unsubstituted
phenyl- and naphthyl-based boronic acids 13a and 14a are also competent substrates for the reaction under both
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic conditions (entries 8 and
9, respectively). Gratifyingly, electron-rich 4-OMe-phenylboronic
acid 15a afforded fluoranthene 15b in 74
and 63% yields with methods A and B, respectively (entry 10). 3-CF3-substituted boronic acid 16a reacts regioselectively
to give product 16b under both conditions (entry 11).
However, 3,5-bis(CF3)-substituted derivative 16a works only with method A (70% yield), whereas method B did not provide
fluoranthene 17b (entry 12). To test a substrate with
ortho substitution, boronic acid 18a was examined, and
fluoranthene 18b was obtained successfully (entry 13).
Finally, in an attempt to synthesize a heteroatom-containing fluoranthene
by our methodology, 4-pyridylboronic acid (19a) was tested,
and we were pleased to obtain azafluoranthene 19b in
64 and 42% yields with methods A and B, respectively (entry 14). This
result underscores the potential of both catalytic conditions to be
applied in the preparation of heteroaromatic fluoranthene analogues.

To gain insights
into the mechanism of the C–H arylation
reaction, we conducted an intermolecular kinetic isotope effect (KIE)
experiment as a preliminary mechanistic study.14,15 For this purpose, we first prepared deuterated fluoranthene 13b-d4 along with
monoarylnaphthalenes 20 and 20-d5 independently. When a 1:1 mixture
of 20 and 20-d5 was treated with Pd(dppf)Cl2 (5 mol %)
under the same reaction conditions but with a shorter reaction time
(3 h), fluoranthene products 13b and 13b-d4 were observed to be in
a ratio of 1.1 by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 1). On the basis of this result,
it can be concluded that the C–H activation step is unlikely
to be the rate-determining step in the overall intramolecular C–H
arylation reaction.

Scheme 1 Intermolecular KIE Experiment
Reusability is one of the significant criteria for evaluating
the
performance of heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, we tested the reusability
of rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts in the synthesis of fluoranthene product 6b (Table 3, entry 1). The nanocatalysts were found to be highly reusable, affording
the fluoranthene product 6b in 62, 58, and 55% yields
in three consecutive cycles (Figure 2a). This means that the rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts preserved
almost 90% of their initial catalytic activity after the third run.
To get insights into the stability of the rGO-CuPd, we analyzed the
rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
after the three-cycle reusability test. A representative TEM image
given in Figure 2b
reveals that no considerable change is observable in the overall dispersion
and particle size of the CuPd alloy NPs over rGO but there is a minimal
deterioration on the morphology of the CuPd NPs realized.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a new catalytic method that allows
the synthesis of substituted fluoranthene derivatives via tandem Suzuki–Miyaura
and intramolecular C–H arylation reactions. The reaction sequence
was found to operate effectively under homogeneous catalytic conditions
using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as well as heterogeneous catalytic conditions
using rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts. The reaction has a broad substrate scope
and functional group tolerance, and fluoranthene products were obtained
in good yields (up to 78%) when various arylboronic acids and esters
having electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups with different
substitution patterns were used. Moreover, the rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts
were found to be reusable heterogeneous catalysts in the presented
method. A preliminary mechanistic study has also been conducted through
an intermolecular KIE experiment. The reaction developed in this work
represents a rare example of a transformation involving a C–H
arylation step that can be promoted successfully under both homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic conditions and therefore is expected to
stimulate further research in this area.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All reactions under homogeneous
catalytic conditions were performed using oven-dried glassware under
an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) using aluminum-backed plates precoated with silica
gel (60 Å, F254). UV light and KMnO4 staining
solution were used for TLC visualization. Flash column chromatography
was performed on 200–400 mesh flash silica gel. NMR spectra
were measured on a Bruker spectrometer at 400 MHz for 1H NMR spectra and at 100 MHz for 13C spectra and calibrated
from internal standard (TMS, 0 ppm) or residual solvent signals (chloroform
at 7.26 ppm, DMSO at 2.50 ppm for 1H spectra and chloroform
at 77.16 ppm and DMSO at 39.52 for 13C spectra). Infrared
[Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)] spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Alpha-Platinum-ATR spectrometer, with only selected peaks reported.
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained using
a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Melting points are uncorrected.

1,8-Diiodonaphthalene (5)16 and rGO-CuPd nanocatalysts12a were prepared
according to reported procedures. All other commercially available
reagents were used as received unless stated otherwise.

General Procedure
for Fluoranthene Synthesis Using Homogeneous
Catalysts (Method A)
A 10 mL oven-dried Schlenk tube was
charged with 1,8-diiodonaphthalene (5) (100 mg, 0.26
mmol, 1.0 equiv) and DMSO (2 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Nitrogen
gas was bubbled through the solution for 5 min with gentle stirring.
Arylboronic acid or pinacol ester (0.30 mmol, 1.1 equiv), Pd(dppf)Cl2·CH2Cl2 (11 mg, 0.013 mmol, 0.05
equiv), and KOAc (100 mg, 1.02 mmol, 4 equiv) were added sequentially
to the solution. The Schlenk tube was then sealed with a glass stopper,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at 90 or 110 °C for 24 h.
The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After cooling to
ambient temperature, brine was added to the reaction mixture, and
the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 10 mL).
The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The viscous crude product
was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel) to afford
the desired product.

General Procedure for Fluoranthene Synthesis
Using Heterogeneous
Catalysts (Method B)
A 10 mL Schlenk tube was charged with
the rGO-CuPd nanocatalyst (4.0 mg) and 2 mL of DMSO/H2O
mixture (DMSO/H2O = 10:1) under air. The suspension was
sonicated for 30 min at room temperature. After complete dispersion
of the catalyst in the solvent mixture, the Schlenk tube was fitted
over a magnetic stirrer. 1,8-Diiodonaphthalene (5) (50
mg, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv), arylboronic acid or pinacol ester (0.15
mmol, 1.1 equiv), and NaOAc·3H2O (54 mg, 0.65 mmol,
5 equiv) were added sequentially to the mixture with a gentle stirring.
The Schlenk tube was then sealed with a glass stopper, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 24 h. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by TLC. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction
mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube by washing with EtOAc.
The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min under 6500 rpm. After complete
precipitation of the catalyst, the organic layer was transferred to
a separatory funnel and washed with brine. It was then dried over
Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo.
Purification by flash column chromatography (silica gel) gave the
desired product.

Procedure for the Recovery of the rGO-CuPd
Catalyst
After the completion of the reaction, the reaction
mixture was transferred
to a centrifuge tube by washing with EtOAc (8 mL). The mixture was
centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant solution was decanted.
The precipitated catalyst was washed additionally with EtOAc (8 mL),
EtOH (2 × 8 mL), and acetone (8 mL). Centrifugation and decantation
were repeated during each wash to remove any impurities and DMSO completely.
The solid catalyst was dried at room temperature and used in the subsequent
run for the reusability tests.

Intermolecular KIE Study
A 10 mL oven-dried Schlenk
tube was charged with 20 (20 mg, 0.06 mmol) and 20-d5 (20 mg, 0.06
mmol), followed by the addition of DMSO (2 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution for 5 min with gentle
stirring. Pd(dppf)Cl2·CH2Cl2 (5 mg, 0.006 mmol) and KOAc (50 mg, 0.5 mmol) were added sequentially
to the reaction mixture. The Schlenk tube was then sealed with a glass
stopper, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 3
h. After cooling to ambient temperature, brine was added to the reaction
mixture, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (2
× 10 mL). The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude reaction
mixture was purified by flash column chromatography (hexane only)
to afford a mixture of the products 13b and 13b-d4 (7.3 mg, 30%) as a viscous
oil. The ratio of the two products was determined by 1H
NMR spectroscopy where the intermolecular KIE k(H)/k(D) was found to be 1.1 based on integration analysis.
This experiment was repeated twice, and the same result was obtained
in both experiments.
