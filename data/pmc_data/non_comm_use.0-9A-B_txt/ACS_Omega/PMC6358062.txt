Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts were studied for NOx reduction.
The total metal loading was varied
as 3, 5, and 7 wt %, whereas the Cu-to-ZnO ratio was fixed at 1:1.
Too high metal loading led to lower reducibility of Cu2+, as CuO and ZnO covers on the catalyst surface could partially block
pores and hinder gas molecules to access the Cu2+ ions.
Subsequently, Cu loading was fixed at 2.5 wt %, whereas ZnO content
was varied as 0, 2.5, and 3.5 wt %. The results demonstrated that
2.5Cu–2.5ZnO catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity,
as it gave the average NO conversion of 87%.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Copper-based
zeolites have been extensively investigated for selective
catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia
(NH3-SCR) due to their good activity over a wide temperature
range and high selectivity toward N2.1 Although Cu/ZSM-5 was discovered as an active catalyst
for NO reduction,2 the main drawback of
Cu/ZSM-5 is the lack of stability and durability.3 However, it has been found that Cu/Al–MCM-41 shows
similar activity to that of Cu–ZSM-54 but exhibits better thermal stability due to its mesoporous structure.
It was reported in our previous work5 that
Al–MCM-41 with the core–shell structure, in which the
core part is mesoporous silica and the shell part is aluminosilicate,
enhances the catalytic activity for NO reduction. With the presence
of aluminosilicate shell, specific active sites of Cu are created
surrounding the outer surface, leading to better accessibility of
the copper active sites. Moreover, a better accessibility of these
copper sites is helpful for the transformation of Cu2+ to
Cu+, which is beneficial for NO reduction.

The oxidation
state of copper plays an important role in NO reduction.
It has been suggested that Cu+ is the key active species
for NO reduction5−7 and the transition between Cu2+ and Cu+ species taking place under SCR reaction was found to be the
key factor in this reaction.1,4 The nature of Cu can
be modified by a promoter and different metal loadings. Our previous
work8 reported that the introduction of
Zn in the form of ZnO can improve the catalytic performance of Cu/core–shell
Al–MCM-41, as it provides surface oxygen for nitrite and nitrate
formation and also promotes the number of Cu+. However,
the effects of ZnO content on the nature of Cu have not been studied
yet. Therefore, in this work, the effects of metal loading and Cu-to-ZnO
ratio on the nature of copper and thus the catalytic performance of
Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of Prepared
Catalysts
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts with different metal contents shown in Figure 1 illustrate the core–shell
structure of mesoporous silica–aluminosilicate composites.
The shell thickness is in the range of 10–20 nm. During metal
loading, loaded metals are expected to be mainly at the aluminosilicate
shell and the TEM images demonstrate that the core–shell structure
is still preserved after the introduction of metals onto the support.

Figure 1 TEM images
of (a) 1.5Cu–1.5ZnO, (b) 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO,
and (c) 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO.

On the other hand, the surface morphology of the catalyst
was observed
by SEM. As shown in Figures S1a, S2a, and S3a, the images exhibit the agglomeration of spherical particles having
size around 100 nm, which is a typical feature of mesoporous materials.9 Furthermore, energy-dispersive system (EDS) mapping
shows that both Cu and Zn are well-distributed on the surface of Al–MCM-41
support (see Figures S1b, S2b, and S3b).
It can be seen that with increasing metal loading, the metals are
more plentiful on the surface of the catalyst; however, the metals
are still well-distributed.

2.2 Crystal Structures
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts with different
metal loadings are presented in Figure 2. The peaks at 2θ of 35.5, 38.8, and 44.5°
are attributed to CuO phase,10,11 whereas the diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 36.0 and 38.1° are assigned to ZnO phase.11,12 There is no sign of mixed Cu–Zn oxide formation in the prepared
catalysts. As shown in Figure 2, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is rather weak, implying
that Cu and Zn species in these catalysts have very small crystallite
size.13 However, by using impregnation
to increase metal contents in the catalysts, both Cu and Zn crystallite
sizes become bigger, as indicated by the higher intensity of the diffraction
peaks.

and (c) 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO.

2.3 Textural Properties
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, average pore diameter, and pore volume of the
prepared catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that BET surface area of
Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts decreased with increasing
metal contents. This is because CuO and ZnO species formed on the
surface of the catalysts could partially block pores of the catalyst,
resulting in the decrease of pore diameter, pore volume, and surface
area. However, for 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO sample, the pore diameter and
pore volume increased whereas BET surface area decreased. These results
suggest that the pore structure might be altered because of high metal
loading. Consequently, the order of pore structure was lower, causing
larger pores.14

2.4 Oxidation
State of Copper and Zinc
2.4.1 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS)
XAS was used to study the oxidation state of copper
in Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts. For the evaluation, the XAS spectra of catalysts are shown
along with those of standard compounds as references (Cu foil, Cu2O, and CuO). As shown in Figure 3, the spectrum of each fresh catalyst is
close to that of CuO standard, as it exhibits the intense postedge
feature at 8998.0 eV, which is assigned to the 1s → 4p transition
in Cu2+.15 This result indicates
that copper in the fresh catalysts is in the oxidation state of Cu2+.

Figure 3 Cu K-edge XANES (a) and Fourier-transformed (k2-weighted) Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) (b) spectra of 1.5Cu–1.5ZnO, 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO, and
3.5Cu–3.5ZnO compared to that of standard Cu foil, Cu2O, and CuO.

Structural information
can be obtained by using EXAFS. In agreement
with XANES results, the EXAFS spectrum of each catalyst is quite similar
to that of CuO standard (see Figure S3b), confirming that Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts consist
of CuO particles. Three features at around 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 Å
are observed for CuO standard compound. The main peak at 1.5 Å
corresponds to the first shell of Cu2+ at six oxygen neighbors
(Cu–O), and the peak at 2.5 Å is attributed to Cu–O
bonds in Cu–O–Cu edge-shared octahedral, whereas the
weak feature at 3 Å refers to the Cu2+ to other Cu2+ atoms. However, the peak intensity of Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts is less than that of CuO standard, probably due to smaller
CuO crystallites. Moreover, the weak feature at 3.0 Å is absent
for Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts. This could be caused
by the diluted content of CuO species in the catalysts compared to
that of pure CuO, making the scattering of the farther Cu–Cu
shell difficult to be detected.16 The results
of the first-shell analysis of Cu K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS spectra of different Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts are shown in Figure S4 and Table S2. All samples have a Cu–O bond distance ca. 1.93 Å with
a coordination number ca. 3.0 (Table S2), in agreement with previous works reported elsewhere.15,17 However, slightly lower Cu–O bond distance of all samples
compared to that of CuO standard (typically 1.96 Å) could be
due to the fact that these Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts
are not composed of only CuO species in the system.

2.4.2 H2 Temperature-Programmed Reduction
(H2 TPR)
The reducibility of the prepared catalysts
was studied by H2 TPR technique. As shown in Figure 4, each H2 TPR profile
was deconvoluted into subpeaks, corresponding to different reduction
processes. The first reduction peak at a lower temperature is likely
attributed to a one-step reduction of CuO located on the external
surface of the catalysts to Cu0. Meanwhile, the second
reduction peak at around 270–310 °C can be assigned to
nanosized CuO located deeper in the pore structure of the catalysts.20 During the catalyst preparation, some part of
the copper precursor (i.e., Cu(NO3)2) was confined
by the capillary effect inside the channels of the catalyst, resulting
in the formation of small crystalline CuO species in pores.18 The presence of both external surface CuO and
nanosized CuO crystals in the Cu-containing catalysts was also found
in the previous works.18,19

Figure 4 H2 TPR profiles of (a) 1.5Cu–1.5ZnO,
(b) 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO,
and (c) 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO.

Generally, Cu2+ ions at the exchange sites are
reduced
to Cu0 via a two-step reduction process.19 Hence, the reduction peaks at around 380–480 °C
are attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ ions whereas the reduction peaks at around 570–640 °C
correspond to the reduction of Cu+ to Cu0. The
results reveal that there are multiple copper species existing in
the catalysts. In addition, it can be seen that the fraction of CuO
species (both external and nanosized CuO species) increased with increasing
metal loading, a fact which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results (see Section 2.4.3). It should be noted that in this work, the Cu loading
of the catalysts was increased by using the impregnation method, in
which copper predominately exists as CuO species.5,18 In
addition, with higher metal loading, it is more difficult for a copper
precursor to infiltrate deeper in the channels of the catalysts and
occupy the exchange sites, leading to the formation of more CuO species
on the surface of the catalyst.

Interestingly, the reduction
temperatures for the two-step reduction
of Cu2+ are observed to increase with increasing metal
content, suggesting that at present, it is more difficult to reduce
copper ions. With higher metal loading, copper ions at the exchange
sites were hindered by CuO and ZnO covering on the surface of the
catalyst, resulting in a lower accessibility of these copper ions
to H2 molecules and a lower reducibility.

Furthermore,
reduction at a very high temperature (700–750
°C) is observed for all Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts
(Figure 1). Some previous
works suggested that Cu+ could be reduced to Cu0 at very high temperature (>700 °C).19 On the other hand, the reduction of Zn species can also take place
at high temperature.20 However, this reduction
at very high temperature is absent for the Cu/Al–MCM-41 catalyst
(see Figure 8). Therefore,
the peak at around 700–750 °C can be assigned to the reduction
of ZnO species. The reduction peak of ZnO species is much smaller
than that of CuO species, confirming the low reducibility of ZnO species.

2.4.3 XPS
As shown in Figure 5, all Cu 2p regions show two
main peaks centered at around 933 and 953 eV, assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 transition of Cu2+, respectively.
Each of the Cu 2p peaks was deconvoluted into two doublets (A and
B components) by XPSPEAK 4.1 software, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 2. The Cu 2p3/2 transition exhibits
two peaks at the binding energy (BE) around 933 eV (A) and 935 eV
(B), whereas the Cu 2p1/2 transition shows two peaks at
the binding energy around 953 eV (A) and 955 eV (B). The component
with lower binding energy (A) is assigned to CuO species.21,22 Meanwhile, the component with higher binding energy (B) likely corresponds
to isolated Cu2+ ions.21,23

The XPS results confirm that both CuO species
and isolated Cu2+ ions coexist in Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts;
however, copper species in these catalysts are mostly presented in
the form of CuO. As shown in Table 2, the contribution of CuO species increased with increasing
metal content, a fact which is in agreement with H2 TPR
results.

Meanwhile, the Zn 2p XPS spectra of Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts with different metal loadings are also depicted in Figure 5. By fitting the
Zn 2p XPS spectra, only one component is observed at 1023 eV for Zn
2p3/2 transition and 1046 eV for Zn 2p1/2 transition
and assigned to ZnO species.24 The absence
of Zn2+ ions at the exchange sites of the catalysts in
this work can be explained by the fact that Zn was loaded onto the
catalysts by the impregnation method only. By using this method, the
majority of Zn species was formed as ZnO, as reported in our previous
work.18

2.5 NH3-SCR Activity Test
All three Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts were tested for
their NH3-SCR activity in terms of NO conversion, N2 selectivity, N2O selectivity, and NO2 selectivity, as shown in Figure 6. The results show that N2 is the main product
of NH3-SCR over these catalysts, as the N2 selectivity
of all catalysts is close to 100%. Only trace amounts of N2O and NO2 were detected. The average NO conversion of
Cu/Al–MCM-41 and Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalysts for
NH3-SCR at 300 °C for 3 h is shown in Table 3.

2.5Cu–2.5ZnO, and 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO at 300 °C for 3
h: (a) NO conversion, (b) N2 selectivity, (c) NO2 selectivity, and (d) N2O selectivity.

Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 Catalysts for SCR of NO with at 300
°C for 3 h

(%)	
1.5Cu–1.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41	80	
2.5Cu–2.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41	87	
2.5Cu/Al–MCM-41	76	
2.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41	72	
3.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41	73	
The results demonstrate that
2.5Cu–2.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalyst exhibits the highest activity compared to that of others,
as it gave the average NO conversion for 3 h of 87%. As the total
metal content was increased from 3 to 5 wt %, more active sites were
available and thus the NH3-SCR activity was improved. However,
too much metal loading could negatively affect the catalytic performance,
as shown by the lowest NH3-SCR activity of 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41.
For 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalyst, the BET surface
area significantly decreased, whereas the average pore diameter increased
compared to that of other catalysts (see Table 1), which are likely due to the partial destruction
of the structure and pore blockage upon the metal introduction.

In addition, the previous work1 stated
that the most active copper species for NO reduction is isolated Cu2+ ions at the exchange sites. As indicated by XPS results,
3.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41 shows the lowest contribution
of isolated Cu2+ ions. Moreover, the isolated Cu2+ ions in 3.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalyst have the lowest
accessibility for gas molecules and are reduced to Cu+ with
difficulty, as shown in H2-TPR profile.

2.6 Effects of ZnO Content
As discussed
in our previous work,8 the introduction
of ZnO can improve NH3-SCR activity by giving more active
sites for NH3 adsorption and nitrite/nitrate formation
and promoting a number of Cu+ ions in the system. To investigate
the effects of ZnO content on the chemical state of Cu and the NH3-SCR activity, another set of Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalysts were studied, in which Cu loading was fixed at 2.5 wt %
whereas Zn loading was varied as 0, 2.5, and 3.5 wt %, corresponding
to Cu-to-ZnO ratios of 1:0, 1:1, and 1:1.4, respectively. Although
it is demonstrated that the presence of ZnO can enhance the catalytic
performance for NO reduction of Cu/Al–MCM-41 (see Figure 7 and Table 3), too high ZnO content in Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41
catalyst can result in lower NO conversion. It can be seen that 2.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41
shows lower catalytic activity than that of 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41
(Figure 4), as it yielded
lower NO conversion for the entire reaction time, with an average
NO conversion for 3 h of 72%.

of NO on 2.5Cu, 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO,
and 2.5Cu–3.5ZnO at 300 °C for 3 h: (a) NO conversion,
(b) N2 selectivity, (c) NO2 selectivity, and
(d) N2O selectivity.

The H2 TPR results shown in Figure 8 demonstrate that the reduction peaks referring to the two-step
reduction of isolated Cu ions at the exchange sites are shifted to
higher temperature with increasing ZnO content, confirming that ZnO
incorporation in these catalysts impedes the reduction of copper ions.
It was reported that zinc is reduced with difficulty and might hinder
Cu ions (both Cu2+ and Cu+) from being reduced.20 The introduction of ZnO can stabilize Cu+ species and hinder the reduction of Cu+ to Cu0 during the pretreatment via the interaction between ZnO and
Cu+, a fact which is beneficial for NO reduction, as Cu+ ions are the active species for this reaction.

Figure 8 H2 TPR profiles of (a) 2.5Cu, (b) 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO,
and (c) 2.5Cu–3.5ZnO.

However, too strong interactions between ZnO and Cu species
can
make the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ much more
difficult, leading to lower Cu reducibility and a number of Cu+ species in the system. Moreover, the XPS results show that
the Cu 2p binding energy of 2.5Cu–3.5ZnO/Al–MCM-41 slightly
shifts to lower energy (see Figure 9). This can be explained by the increase of electron
cloud density around Cu ions caused by the electron donation from
ZnO promoter, which can decrease the reducibility of Cu.25 Therefore, on the basis of the experimental
results in this study, Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalyst with
a total metal content of 5 wt % and Cu-to-Zn ratio of 1:1 exhibits
the best catalytic performance for NH3-SCR.

(a) 2.5Cu, (b) 2.5Cu–2.5ZnO, and (b)
2.5Cu–3.5ZnO.

3 Conclusions
Both metal loading and
Cu-to-ZnO ratio can affect the catalytic
performance of Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 for NH3-SCR.
The contribution of CuO species increased with increasing metal loading
by using impregnation method. The NH3-SCR activity was
improved with increasing metal loading because more available active
sites were presented. However, too high metal loading can result in
lower BET surface area and lower reducibility of Cu2+ ions,
as CuO and ZnO covers on the surface of the catalyst can partially
block pores and hinder gas molecules from accessing the Cu2+ ions.

Even though it was demonstrated that the presence of
ZnO can enhance
the NH3-SCR activity of the catalyst, too high ZnO content
can give negative effects. Too strong interactions between Cu and
ZnO impede the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+, leading
to lower Cu reducibility and lower number of Cu+ species
in the system. Hence, on the basis of the experimental results in
this study, Cu–ZnO/Al–MCM-41 catalyst with a total metal
content of 5 wt % and Cu-to-Zn ratio of 1:1 exhibits the best catalytic
performance for NH3-SCR.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Catalysts
A core–shell
structured Al–MCM-41 was synthesized via the method reported
by Chamnankid et al. (2012),5 in which
cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB: 98%, APS Ajax Finechem) was
used as a structural directing agent whereas tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS: 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O: 98%, QREC) were used as silica
and alumina sources, respectively. The molar gel composition was 1SiO2:0.2CTAB:100H2O, whereas the Al2O3/SiO2 ratio was fixed at 0.1. TEOS was first added
to a mixture of Al(NO3)3 and CTAB at 40 °C.
After stirring for 1 h, the pH of the mixed solution was adjusted
to 6.5 by adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH: 98%, Carlo Erba). Next,
the mixture was stirred for another 5 h before being transferred to
a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C
for 24 h. The obtained product was filtered and washed with distilled
water, dried at 80 °C overnight, and calcined at 600 °C
for 5 h.

For metal loading, the Cu-to-ZnO molar ratio was fixed
at 1:1. The method for Cu and Zn loading was modified from our previous
work.18 Copper loading was performed by
the combined method: substitution, followed by ion exchange, and incipient
wetness impregnation, whereas Zn loading was conducted by incipient
wetness impregnation only.

First, copper (0.5 wt %) was incorporated
into the framework of
Al–MCM-41 by using substitution method. The procedure was similar
to the synthesis of core–shell Al–MCM-41 except that
copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O: 99.5%, Loba Chemie) was added into the mixture of Al(NO3)3 and CTAB before adding TEOS. Then, the resultant product
was further suspended in 0.1 M of Cu(NO3)2 solution
to perform ion exchange at 40 °C for 10 h. The product was then
filtered and rinsed with deionized water, dried overnight at 100 °C,
and calcined at 400 °C for 5 h. Last, the obtained product was
impregnated with a mixture of copper nitrate and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O: 98%, Loba Chemie) solution
with different concentrations and then calcined in air at 400 °C
for 5 h. It should be noted that for the substitution and ion exchange
steps, Cu loading was identical for all catalysts. On the other hand,
the metal loading was varied for the incipient wetness impregnation
step. The nomenclature and the metal content of the obtained catalysts
are shown in Table S1.

4.2 Catalysts Characterization
The metal
content in the obtained catalysts was measured by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Aligent 700-ES series).

The core–shell structure of the sample was confirmed by a
transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-3100 (HR)) operated
with an acceleration of 300 kV. Sample preparation entailed suspension
of the sample in ethanol, followed by evaporation of ethanol on a
copper grid coated with a carbon film. Additionally, the morphology
and the metal dispersion of the catalysts were examined by using a
field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7600F).

The textural properties of the catalysts were obtained from nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement by using a Quantachrome
Autosorb-1C instrument. Prior to the measurement, the samples were
degassed at 200 °C for 12 h. The adsorption isotherms were measured
at −196 °C and 10–5 < P/P0 < 1.0. The specific surface area
was estimated by the BET method using P/P0 values between 0.05 and 0.30. The pore size distribution
was obtained using desorption branch of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. The total pore volume was estimated from adsorption data at P/P0 of 0.99.

X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was conducted using a Philips
X’Pert diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and
30 mA). The XRD patterns were collected with a step size of 0.02°
in the 2θ range from 10 to 50°.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted
in an AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer. All recorded spectra were decomposed
by using XPSPEAK 4.1 software after applying a Shirley background
subtraction and Gaussian–Lorentzian decomposition parameters.24 The type of peak was set as p-type, in which
an area ratio of 2p3/2 to 2p1/2 was fixed at
2:1.

X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were done
at beamline
2.2: time-resolved absorption spectroscopy (Bonn-SUT-SLRI) of the
Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand. The electron
storage ring was used at energy of 1.2 GeV (beam current: 80–150
mA). The energy was selected with a Si(220) crystal monochromator
for collecting the Cu K-edge in transmission mode. The obtained data
was processed by using ATHENA and ARTEMIS software. For the first-shell
analysis of Cu K-edge EXAFS spectra, the normalized data was k3-weighted and the analysis was performed in
a k-range of 2–9 Å and R-range of 1.2–2.2.

Temperature-programmed reduction
with hydrogen (H2-TPR)
was performed in a tubular reactor (Inconel-600, OD 3/8 in.). The
catalyst (0.25 g) blended with quartz sand (1 g) was heated from 30
to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min under a flow of
9.6% H2/Ar (15 mL/min). The H2 consumption was
detected by a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014) equipped with a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD). All H2-TPR profiles
were deconvoluted by OriginPro 8.5 software with a Gaussian peak function.

4.3 Catalyst Activity Measurement
NH3-SCR activity test was conducted in a fixed-bed tube reactor
(a 3/8 in. diameter) using a 0.2 g sample mixed with 0.8 g of quartz
sand. The sample was pretreated by reduction with H2 at
350 °C for 2 h. The gas flow rate and gas hourly space velocity
were controlled at 30 mL/min and 1300 h–1, respectively.
For all experiments, the feed gas contained 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 3% O2, and He as the balance. The NH3-SCR activity of the catalysts was tested at atmospheric pressure
and 300 °C for 3 h. The outlet gaseous composition was determined
by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-14A TCD detector) equipped with
two columns: Unibeads C column for detecting N2 and O2 and Porapak-Q column for detecting NO, NO2, and
N2O. Consequently, NO conversion (XNO) was calculated from following equation 1  The N2, NO2, and N2O selectivity
were calculated from their detected amounts
divided by the amount of NO consumed.
