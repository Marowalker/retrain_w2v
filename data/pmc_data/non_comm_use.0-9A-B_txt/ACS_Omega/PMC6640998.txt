Elimination or reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere is
a serious problem faced by humankind, and it has become imperative
for chemists to find ways of transforming undesirable CO2 to useful chemicals. One of the best means is the use of solar energy
for the photochemical reduction of CO2. In spite of considerable
efforts, discovery of stable photocatalysts which work in the absence
of scavengers has remained a challenge although encouraging results
have been obtained in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in both gas and liquid phases. Semiconductor-based catalysts, multicomponent
semiconductors, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and dyes as
well as composites involving novel composite materials containing
C3N4 and MoS2 have been employed
for the photoreduction process. Semiconductor heterostructures, especially
those containing bimetallic alloys as well as chemical modification
of oxides and other materials with aliovalent anion substitution (N3– and F– in place of O2–), remain worthwhile efforts. In this article, we provide a brief
perspective of the present status of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in both liquid and gas phases.

1 Introduction
Nearly 80% of the energy
supply of the world is based on fossil
fuels, and humankind is expected to face a serious crisis because
of the fast depletion of fossil fuels and increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. The present global energy consumption
rate of 16.3 TW (2012) will be reaching nearly 40 TW by 2050 and nearly
60 TW by 2100.1 The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that by the year 2100 the CO2 levels may rise up to 590 ppm, and the average global temperature
may rise by 1.9 °C.2 As per the fifth
assessment report (2014) of the IPCC, the levels of green house gases
(GHGs) are increasing drastically. The steady increase of +1.3% per
year (1970–2000) has taken a steep rise of +2.2% per year (2000
onward).3 Increasing atmospheric levels
of CO2 can adversely affect the world, causing an increase
in average sea levels and average global temperature.3 Either developing alternative fuels or converting CO2 back to the fuel forms would balance the CO2 levels
in the atmosphere. Sun’s energy reaching the earth’s
surface (1.3 × 105 TW) is 10 000 times higher
than the present rate of consumption or demand. Researchers are, therefore,
attempting to develop photocatalysts for splitting water or reducing
CO2 to fuels (H2, CO, HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, CH4) using solar energy.

Natural photosynthesis
involves both the oxidation of water and
the reduction of CO2 wherein three processes, light harvesting,
generation of carriers, and separation and catalytic reactions, occur.
Artificial photosynthesis attempts are being conducted to accomplish
these by a two- or one-step process, the former being akin to the
Z-scheme in natural photosynthesis.4 The
photocatalytic agents in artificial photosynthesis can be semiconductors
or dyes. In this perspective, we discuss the present status of the
approaches to reduce CO2 to the production of alternative
fuels based on the recent literature as well as some of our own findings.

2 Basics
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction with
water is akin to natural
photosynthesis, a process wherein plants convert CO2 and
H2O to oxygen and carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight.
In this process solar energy is being converted and stored in the
form of chemical bonds (carbohydrates). It is a combination of water
oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction (or CO2 fixation)
reactions and involves both light and dark reactions.

The process
of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on a semiconductor
photocatalyst is illustrated in Figure 1. Similar to photocatalytic water splitting,5 this process also involves three steps. They
are(i) Absorption
of light (hν > Eg) by the semiconductor;

(ii) Separation of charge carriers (electron–hole);

(iii) Redox reactions at the surface

Upon illumination of light the photocatalyst absorbs
light,
and electrons in the VB get excited to the CB, leaving behind holes
in the VB. Reduction of CO2 is an uphill reaction, and
in order to enable these uphill reactions, CB and VB of the photocatalyst
should straddle the reduction potential of CO2 and the
oxidation potential of water (Figure 1). A negative CB edge relative to the reduction potential
CO2 facilitates the transfer of electrons from the CB to
CO2. A positive VB edge relative to the water oxidation
potential facilitates the transfer of holes from the VB to water.
Therefore, under the irradiation of light, transfer of electrons from
the CB to CO2 as well as from water to the VB are thermodynamically
favorable, whereas direct reduction of CO2 using water
is an uphill reaction. Electrons in the CB reduce CO2,
whereas holes in the VB oxidize water to oxygen (Figure 1).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration
of mechanism and (b) relative energy
levels of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on a semiconductor
photocatalyst.

The formal reduction
potentials of the reactions associated with
the photoreduction of CO2 and H2O are given
in eqs 1–8 (at pH 7).6 One-electron
reduction reactions of CO2 such as formation of CO2•– are not feasible due to their
large negative reduction potentials (E(CO2/ CO2•–) = −1.85 V vs
SHE) relative to the conduction band (CB) edges of many of the semiconductors.
Highly negative reduction potential arises from the change in hybridization
of C from sp2 to sp3.6 Reduction potentials for the formation of HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 are small (−0.665, −0.485, −0.399,
and −0.246 V) and positive relative to CB edges of several
of the semiconductors. It is therefore preferabe to undergo proton-coupled
electron transfer (PCET) wherein electron transfer to CO2 is associated with proton transfer. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  

The ΔG values of the reactions are obtained
from the equation, ΔG = −nFEcell. The ΔG values of the above
reactions are positive (nonspontaneous), being the least for the formation
of HCOOH and maximum for the formation of CH4 (HCOOH <
CO < HCHO < CH3OH < CH4). However,
they are also more positive compared to the ΔG of splitting of water.

The mechanism of reduction of CO2 on metallic surfaces
has been widely discussed.6 Here, we briefly
discuss the mechanism of CO2 reduction on the TiO2 surface.6 There are several possible
configurations for CO2 adsorbed on the photocatalyst as
shown in Figure 2.7 Spectroscopic studies have revealed the presence
of bent CO2 on the TiO2 surface under illumination.
Surface Ti3+ adsorbs CO2 and forms bent CO2•– by transferring an electron, and
Ti3+ gets oxidized back to Ti4+. The H atom
present on the surface assists in the further reduction of CO2•–. Gaseous CO2 is a linear
molecule, whereas the surface-bound carbon species have a bent structure.
The adsorbed carbonate or CO2•– species are active in the photoreduction of CO2.8 LUMO of the surface chemisorbed CO2 species (carbonate or CO2•–)
is lower compared to that of gaseous CO2, thereby making
it easier to accept excited electrons form the semiconductors. CO2 is an acidic molecule; therefore, basic metal oxides have
greater tendency for CO2 adsorption.

Figure 2 Schematic of the possible
CO2 adsorption configurations
on surfaces of photocatalysts. Reproduced with permission from ref (7).

The reduction potentials for the PCET reactions are within
the
range of −0.7 to −0.2 V and are close to the reduction
potential of water (−0.414 V at pH 7). The reduction products
of CO2 (HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4) require
multielectron transfer, whereas the reduction of water is a two-electron
process. Reduction of water therefore competes with the reduction
of CO2. Because of this, the extent of hydrogen generation
is greater in liquid-phase reactions compared to vapor-phase reactions.
Yields of photocatalytic processes are often much lower than the amount
of photocatalysts. It is possible to obtain the products from stoichiometric
reactions involved with unstable photocatalysts. It is, therefore,
necessary to present the activities in terms of TON and TOF (TON per
unit time) in order to distinguish from stoichiometric reactions.
Generally, for catalytic reactions TON is ≫1.

3 Methods of Reducing CO2
Reduction of CO2 can be carried out in the liquid phase
or gas phase. In the liquid-phase reaction, reduction of CO2 is carried out with a saturated aqueous solution of CO2. Limited solubility of CO2 in water is the crucial problem
to drive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 efficiently.9 The solubility of CO2 in water can
be improved by using additives such as NaOH, NaHCO3, or
Na2CO3. These additives enhance the CO2 solubility, though the reduction of bicarbonate and carbonate species
is more difficult. Surface adsorption of H2O is more preferable
over CO2 in the liquid phase, and thus the reduction of
water is favorable. On the other hand, gas-phase reactions were carried
out with humidified CO2. In order to explore the effect
of the method of evaluation on activities, Xie et al.10 have employed TiO2 and Pt-TiO2 as
photocatalysts and studied the reduction of CO2 in both
the liquid phase and gas phase. CH4 production activity
is nearly 3 times more, whereas hydrogen production is less in gas-phase
compared to liquid-phase reactions. Nearly 3–4 times more selectivity
in CO2 reduction over water reduction is observed in the
gas phase.

Quantum dot photocatalysts have gained importance
due to their
high surface area and shorter charge transfer pathways.11 In addition, they possess enlarged band gaps
and shifted band positions because of quantum confinement that provides
more potential energy for photochemical reactions.12 In a recent study, CsPbBr3 quantum dots were
employed for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The QDs are
more active than the bulk compound, giving CO 49.5 μmol g–1 and CH4 22.9 μmol g–1 after 12 h (100 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter).13

The efficiency of photocatalysts depends on the morphology,
exposed
facets, size and surface vacancies, etc. The activity in the liquid
phase is also affected by the pH of the reaction medium, surface hydroxyl
groups, solvent, and additives. The increase in pH increases the rate
of the reaction  This leads to different concentrations of
species (CO32–, HCO3–, and CO2) at different values of pH.14 The different chemical species get adsorbed to different
extents on the catalyst surface and have different reduction potentials.15 Thus, addition of NaOH could improve the dissolution
of CO2, thereby increasing the efficiency of photoreduction
of CO2 on TiO2-supported Cu catalysts.16 In the gas phase, photocatalytic activity is
affected by the surface properties of the photocatalysts, CO2–H2O ratio, and feed pressure, temperature, etc.

It is often customary to use sacrificial reagents to consume the
holes. The addition of a sacrificial reagent to the reaction mixture
enhances photocatalytic reduction, but in most of the cases the reagent
would contribute to the yield of products. For example, methanol is
used as a sacrificial hole acceptor. The reaction mechanism for the
oxidation of methanol involves a step in which an electron is injected
into the conduction band of the photocatalyst. This implies that part
of the CO2 reduction products are formed through the action
of holes and not that of the electrons.17 The presence of organic adsorbents (CH3CO2H, CH3OH, HCO2H, etc.) on the surface of the
photocatalyst plays an important role in the photoreduction of CO2. The presence of CH3CO2H on the photocatalyst
surface leads to the formation of CH4. This can occur by
the conversion of CH3CO2H to CH4 via
the photo-Kolbe reaction.18 Photocatalysis
without any organic adsorbents shows a negligible amount of CH4 production.19

4 Semiconductor-Based Photocatalysts
TiO2 has been
employed extensively as a photocatalyst
since the early report by Fujishima et al.20 for the photochemical reduction of CO2. A systematic
study on photocatalytic as well as photoelectrochemical reduction
of CO2 was carried out in aqueous suspensions of semiconductor
powders such as TiO2, ZnO, CdS, Sic, etc.20 The yields of methanol are well correlated with the CB
edge position of the semiconductors, indicating the necessary requirement
of a negative CB edge relative to the CO2/CH3OH reduction potential. Anpo et al.21 have
shown the necessity of the presence of H2O for the photoreduction
of CO2 by employing titanium oxides anchored within the
micropores on zeolites.

4.1 Use of Cocatalyst
Deposition of metals
such as Pt, Au, Pd, Ag, and Cu on the photocatalysts affects the photochemical
reduction of CO2. The metals catalyze the reduction reactions
upon receiving electrons from the photocatalyst. Ag shows superior
activity for CO2 reduction due to weak binding with the
CO, whereas Pt gets poisoned by CO. Pt is also highly selective to
the reduction of water.6 Iizuka et al.22 have reported photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over Ag cocatalyst-loaded anisotropic ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) using water as a reducing
reagent. Here, the Ag cocatalyst efficiently reduces CO2, the high yields of CO arising from the separate reaction sites
for reduction and oxidation. Thus, coupling of semiconductors with
bimetallic systems also shows promising results. Thus, Cu–Pt
bimetallic cocatalysts loaded on TiO2 (Cu–Pt/TiO2) nanotubes reduce CO2 to CH4, C2H4, C2H6, etc., with 4-fold
improvement in the conversion in the presence of H2O under
solar irradiation.23 Codeposition of oxidation
and reduction cocatalysts such as RuO2 (1 wt %) and Pt
(1 wt %) on Zn2GeO4 causes significant improvement
in CH4 production.24

4.2 Doping or Codoping
Since the UV component
in the sunlight is limited (∼4%), researchers have mainly explored
visible-light (∼43%) sensitive photocatalysts. The electronic
band structure of the wide-band-gap semiconductors is altered by the
incorporation of foreign elements into the lattice of the semiconductors.
For example, N doping or Ce doping in TiO2 shows a red-shift
in the absorption onset with visible absorption and superior activity
compared to undoped TiO2.6 N
doping in TiO2 as in CuO/TiO2–xNx enhances the conversion of CO2 to CH4 under solar irradiation.25 Nakanishi et al.26 have employed
metal-doped NaTaO3 (NaTaO3:A, where A = Ca,
Mg, Sr, Ba, or La) with Ag cocatalysts under UV–visible irradiation
(Figure 3) for the
reduction of CO2 to CO. Ag deposited NaTaO3:Ba
exhibits superior activity among all cation-doped NaTaO3, in the absence of any additives. Addition of NaHCO3 enhances
CO production activity with NaTaO3:Ba being superior in
the reduction of CO2 with nearly 90% selectivity toward
the reduction of CO2. However, a considerable fraction
of electrons is utilized in the reduction of water. Herein, water
acts as a reducing agent and gets oxidized to oxygen.

in the liquid phase under UV irradiation. Figure legends: hydrogen
(open circle), oxygen (solid circle), and CO (triangle). Reproduced

4.3 Solid
Solutions
Electronic band structures
of wide-band-gap semiconductors can be tailored by forming solid solutions.
Liu et al.27 have employed (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox)
nanostructures for the reduction of CO2 to CH4 under visible-light irradiation. Figure 4 shows the electronic absorption spectra
of the nitridation product of Zn2GeO4 (band
gap 4.53 eV) with varying duration of nitridation at 700 °C.
The absorption onset is gradually red-shifted with the increase in
nitridiation period, and samples turn yellow in color. Superior CO2 reduction activity under visible-light irradiation is obtained
with the product having a band gap of ∼2.4 eV, obtained after
a nitridation period of 6 h (Zn 26.4%, Ge 19.6%, N 40.8%, and O 13.2%)
with CH4 yield of 1.63 μmol h–1 with O2:CH4 ratio of 2:1 since the CH4 is an eight-electron reduction production and O2 is a four-electron oxidation production.

5 Multicomponent Photocatalysts
5.1 TiO2–RuH
Huang
et al.28 have developed a mononuclear C5H5–RuH complex oxo-bridged with TiO2 for photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 under
visible-light irradiation with a quantum efficiency of 0.56%. In this
system, C5H5–RuH serves as the photon
harvester and water-oxidation site, whereas TiO2 acts as
the electron collector and site of CO2 reduction (Figure 5). The amount of
CH4 increases linearly under visible-light irradiation
with time, whereas under dark conditions, no CH4 is detected.
The photocatalytic activity is maximum at Ru loading of 0.5 wt % on
TiO2. The superior efficiency of the catalyst for CO2 reduction is attributed to the long-lived D+–C–A– charge-separated state.

5.2 Semiconductor
MOFs
Metal–organic
frameworks have gained importance as photocatalysts in recent years
since many of them possess high surface areas and good gas-adsorption
properties. MOFs with a high CO2 uptake can be considered
as potential candidates for the CO2 reduction. Here, we
discuss a study based on a combination of TiO2 with MOFs.
Li et al.29 have developed Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 (BTC-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate)
core–shell photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. Figure 6 shows a
schematic diagram as well as TEM and SEM images of the corresponding
nanostructures. There is a shell of TiO2 over the Cu3(BTC)2 microcrystals, and the BET surface areas
of Cu3(BTC)2 and Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 are 1183 m2 g–1 and
756 m2 g–1, respectively. The decrease
in the surface area of the core–shell structure is attributed
to the presence of a TiO2 shell which does not have a large
surface area. CO2 adsorption based on the weight of the
Cu3(BTC)2 component (80.75 cm3 g–1) of the core–shell structure is comparable
to the bare Cu3(BTC)2 (49.17 cm3 g–1). This observation implies that the CO2 molecules can easily go through the macroporous TiO2 shells
and get adsorbed at the microporous Cu3(BTC)2 cores. The photocatalytic activities of the TiO2 and
Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 core–shell
structure are given in Figure 6. The CH4 production rate of the MOF is higher
than that for TiO2, and the MOF does not generate H2. Note that the Cu3(BTC)2 itself is
inactive.

5.3 Composites of Graphitic C3N4
Graphitic C3N4 has been used
as a photocatalyst due to its high stability and visible response
(Eg = 2.7 eV).30 Due to the fast recombination of the excited electron–hole
pair, C3N4 is employed in combination with other
materials. Loading of noble metals on the surface of g-C3N4 facilitates the interfacial transfer of electrons from
g-C3N4 to the metal particles. For example,
loading of Pt on g-C3N4 increases the rate of
reduction of CO2. The selectivity depends on the amount
of Pt. An increase in Pt content from 0 to 1 wt % increases the yields
of CH4 and CH3OH, and a Pt content of 0–0.75
wt % favors formation of HCOOH.31

g-C3N4 is also used to form heterojunctions
to suppress the recombination of electrons and holes. The introduction
of g-C3N4 in NaNbO3 nanowires increases
the photocatalytic performance considerably (8-fold higher activity
than naked C3N4).32 Similarly, deposition of Ag3PO4 on g-C3N4 enhances the photocatalytic performance.33 Ong et al.34 have
demonstrated a robust method to synthesize proton-functionalized/protonated
g-C3N4 (pCN). The positively charged g-C3N4 can form a hybrid nanostructure with the negatively
charged GO sheets, forming rGO/pCN which is more active than the g-C3N4 itself. Addition of rGO has a substantial effect
on the photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4 which increases with the increase in rGO content. The highest CH4 production occurs for the 15 wt % rGO/pCN (13.93 μmol
g–1, 5.4 times higher than C3N4). The higher activity by the addition of rGO is due to its lower
Fermi level relative to the conduction band of C3N4. The formation of this heterojunction suppresses the charge
recombination.

5.4 Semiconductor Homojunctions
The dependence
of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 on the facet and
shape of the catalyst particles is known. Yu et al.35have carried out photocatalytic CO2 reduction
on TiO2 with coexposed facets of (001) and (101). DFT electronic
structure calculations show that the CB and the VB of the (101) facets
of TiO2 are positioned slightly below the CB and the VB
of the (001) facets of TiO2, respectively. This is similar
to type II band alignment in semiconductor-based heterostructures.
Apparently, exposure of the (001) facets increases the amount of CH4. The facets help in the separation of charges with the electrons
migrating to the (101) facet and the holes migrating to the (001)
facet. A study based on TiO2 with systematically varied
ratios of (001) and (101) facets shows that the photocatalytic production
of CH4 increases with the increase in the fraction of (001)
facets, reaching a maximum of 1.35 μmol h–1 g–1 at 58% of (001) facets (Figure 7). Further increase in the (001) facet fraction
decreases the photocatalytic activity. Similarly, facet-derived heterostructures
formed by ZnSn(OH)6 also give rise to superior photocatalytic
activity and longer charge carrier lifetimes.36

Cosubstitution of aliovalent anions such as N3– and F– for O2– in an oxide has
a huge effect in altering the electronic band structure as well as
optical and catalytic properties.37 N and
F cosubstituted TiO2 (anatase) has a band gap of 2.6 eV
and is yellow in color (Figure 8). N,F-TiO2 reduces CO2 to CO using
water as the reducing agent under natural solar irradiation. Ag deposition
on N,F-TiO2 is more effective, Pt being the least effective
for the reduction of CO2. N,F-TiO2 has been
explored for the construction of homojunctions with undoped TiO2. From the first-principles calculations on N,F-TiO2 it is evident that the CB of N,F-TiO2 remains the same
as that of TiO2; however, the VB is dominated by the N
2p states. Band alignment of the junction of TiO2 and N,F-TiO2 can be considered as quasi-type II. Reduction of CO2 is superior with homojunctions over individual TiO2 and
N,F-TiO2, showing the effectiveness of homojunctions (Table 1).22,24,27,38−44

5.5 Semiconductor Heterostructures
Type
II band alignment in heterostructures causes effective charge separation.
Kim et al.44 have employed Cu2ZnSnS4/TiO2 heterostructures with type II band
alignment for the reduction of CO2 under solar irradiation
(Figure 9). CH4 yield of 119 ppm h–1 g–1 is achieved with the heterostructure, which is nearly 12 times higher
compared to TiO2 alone. The superior activity in heterostructures
is attributed to the improved light absorption and surface area in
addition to effective charge separation. Wang et al.45 have employed CdSe/Pt/TiO2 heterostructures
for the visible-light-induced reduction of CO2. These heterostructures
exhibited reduction of CO2 under visible-light irradiation,
in the presence of H2O, leading to the formation of CH4 (48 ppm g–1 h–1) and
methanol (3.3 ppm g–1 h–1) and
H2 (trace) and CO (trace). Replacing Pt with Fe only resulted
in the formation of H2 (>55 ppm g–1 h–1) which indicates that Fe catalyzes photoreduction
of water rather than of CO2. Wang et al.46 have used PbS/Cu/TiO2 and CdSe/Pt/TiO2 heterostructures for the photoreduction of CO2. Both
of them suffer from photodegradation due to the oxidation of CdSe
and PbS quantum dots. CsPbBr3 QD/GO shows higher activity
than CsPbBr3 QDs with CO and CH4 rates of 58.7
and 29.6 μmol/g in 12 h.13 Roy in
this laboratory has been able to reduce CO2 to CO by solar
radiation using Cd4P2X3 (X = Cl,
Br, or I) in the absence of any sacrificial agent.

CO2 reduction in Cu2ZnSnS4/TiO2 heterostructures. (b) Comparison of photocatalytic activities
of Cu2ZnSnS4/TiO2 with different
compositions and individual Cu2ZnSnS4 and TiO2. Reproduced with permission from ref (44).

ZnO/Pt/CdS heterostructures with type II band alignment and
metal
nanoparticles present on the oxide surface have shown excellent photocatalytic
activity for hydrogen evolution.47 These
heterostructures would be potential candidates for the efficient reduction
of CO2 under visible-light irradiation. However, Pt is
often poisoned by CO; therefore, it would be beneficial to use Ag
in place of Pt. Cu is also effective for the reduction of CO2 but is unstable. In view of this, we have employed heterostructures
containing bimetallic alloys and systematically evaluated the photocatalytic
activities of ZnO/M/CdS (M = Ag, Au, Pt, Ag1–xAux, Ag1–xCux) heterostructures. ZnO/Ag/CdS
and ZnO/Au/CdS exhibit significant CO2 reduction activity,
whereas ZnO/Pt/CdS exhibits mainly reduction of water. Bimetallic
Ag0.5Au0.5 exhibits superior
CO2 reduction activity compared to individual Ag and Au
under visible-light irradiation. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under visible-light irradiation on ZnO/Ag1–xCux/CdS heterostructures
is presented in Figure 10. ZnO/Ag0.75Cu0.25/CdS heterostructures exhibit superior activity (327 μmol h–1 g–1) with the least hydrogen evolution
activity among all the compositions. The ZnO/CdS interface causes
effective separation of charge carriers, and the bimetallic alloy,
Ag0.75Cu0.25, is a stable
and efficient cocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 (Table 2).10,48−52 A noteworthy feature of these heterostructures is that they are
photocatalytically active even in the absence of any sacrificial agent
in the gas phase with a CO production activity of 2 μmol h–1 g–1.

5.6 Z-Scheme
Photocatalysts
Wang et al.38 have
recently developed an α-Fe2O3/Cu2O Z-scheme photocatalyst for the reduction
of CO2 using water as the reducing agent (Figure 11). α-Fe2O3 is an n-type material, while Cu2O is a p-type
material. The photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation
increases with the increasing Cu2O content reaching a maximum
yield of 5 μmol g–1 in 3 h with a Cu:Fe ratio
of 0.5:1. Further increase in the Cu2O content decreases
the activity. Band positions estimated from electronic absorption,
ultraviolet photoelectron, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopic studies
show that α-Fe2O3/Cu2O forms
a p–n junction. The observed photocatalytic activity arises
because of the operation of the Z-scheme.

of the process of Z-scheme charge transfer
and CO2 reduction in α-Fe2O3/Cu2O heterostructures. (b) Comparison of yield of CO
production with varying the Cu content in these heterostructures.

Takayama et al.53 have employed
CuGaS2–RGO–TiO2 for the liquid-phase
reduction
of CO2 under UV–visible irradiation (Figure 12). CuGaS2 acts
as a reduction center, whereas TiO2 acts as an O2 evolution center. RGO facilitates the electron transfer from the
CB of TiO2 to the VB of the CuGaS2. In the absence
of RGO, the photocatalytic activities are negligible. The photocatalytic
production of hydrogen (28.8 μmol h–1) is
larger than that of CO (0.15 μmol h–1).

6 Outlook
While finding photocatalysts with viable photostability remains
a great challenge for reducing CO2 in the absence of any
hole scavenger, chemists have no option but to discover the right
catalysts. Considering the small UV fraction in solar irradiation,
we need to concentrate on visible-light-sensitive photocatalysis.
In this regard, N and F codoped systems such as ZnO1–x(N,F)x, TiO2–x(N,F)x, and SrTiO3–x(N,F)x could be potential candidates for both visible-light sensitization
as well as photostability. Recent work suggests beneficial results
by using bimetallic alloys in heterostructures. There may be new catalytic
materials such as Cd4P2X3 (X = Cl,
Br, or I) with favorable characteristics. Recently it has been shown
that cross-linked materials of C3N4 and others
show remarkable properties. Exploring them for the reduction of CO2 is also important.

Bipolar membranes are employed between
anodic and cathodic compartments
in order to avoid the migration of reactive species. Therefore, carrying
out oxidation and reduction reactions in chambers separated with bipolar
membranes would be a good strategy for beneficial conversion of CO2. Since it is likely that CO will be the prominent product
of photoreduction of CO2, it would require further processing
to generate methanol and other products. Direct photochemical conversion
of CO2 to methanol and other useful compounds continues
to remain an important research target.
