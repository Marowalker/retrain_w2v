Porous hydrogels possessing mechanical
toughness were prepared
from sacran, a supergiant liquid crystalline (LC) polysaccharide produced
from Aphanothece sacrum. First, layered
hydrogels were prepared by thermal cross-linking of film cast over
a sacran LC solution. Then, anisotropic pores were constructed using
a freeze-drying technique on the water-swollen layered hydrogels.
Scanning electron microscopic observation revealed that pores were
observable only on the side faces of sponge materials parallel to
the layered structure but never on the top or bottom faces. The pore
size, porosity, and swelling behavior were controlled by the thermal-cross-linking
temperature. To clarify the freezing effect, a freeze–thawing
method was used for comparison. The freeze–thawed hydrogels
also formed layers but no pores. The mechanical properties and network
structures of hydrogels were also studied, clarifying that porous
hydrogels, even those with a high quantity of pores, were tough owing
to the pores orienting along the layer direction like tunnels.

==== Body
Introduction
Porous hydrogels have
been widely applied in the fields of artificial
muscles, microfluidic valves, actuators, soft robotics, drug carriers,
microlenses, supported catalysis, and chromatography.1−8 Modulation of pore size and their distribution are essential for
controlling hydrogel properties. Several strategies, such as gas foaming,
fiber bonding, and porogen leaching, have been developed to fabricate
hydrogels with homogeneous macropores for rapid stimuli response.2 One of the simplest methods for forming pores
in hydrogels is freeze drying and reswelling. The drawback of this
method is that pore formation worsens the mechanical properties of
the hydrogels, limiting their application.

Sacran is a newly
developed sulfated polysaccharide extracted from
a cyanobacterium, Aphanothece sacrum, which grows in underground freshwater. Sacran contains various
sugar residues, such as Glc, Gal, Man, Xyl, Rha, Fuc, uronic acids,
and muramic acids, where the chains are sulfated at a degree of 10–20
mol % to sugar residues (Figure S1). The
sacran chain has a very high molecular weight of over 2.0 × 107 g/mol (molecular length, over 30 μm) and shows self-assembly
with increases in the solution concentration to achieve a rigid-rod
structure at around 0.1%. In thicker solutions with concentrations
ranging over 0.3%, the sacran solution exhibits a liquid crystalline
(LC) phase.9 Sacran has various properties,
such as superhigh water-absorbing capacity, and has potential for
wound-healing functions, anti-inflammatory effects, and antiallergic
activities.10−12 Another unique behavior of sacran is film formation
with an in-plane orientation structure, which shows anisotropic swelling.
These properties of sacran and the above-mentioned importance of porous
hydrogels motivated us to create tough and porous gels with molecular
orientation of sacran LC chains.13,14

Here,
we report a new, simple method of preparing layered sacran
hydrogels with anisotropic pore structures by a casting and freeze-drying
approach, although many other complicated methods have been reported
for the preparation of porous hydrogels, such as metal–organic
frameworks,15−17 electrospinning,18−23 gas foaming,24 three-dimensional printing,25−28 porogen leaching,29−31 and freezing polymerization.32,33 First, we used the conventional freeze-drying technique directly
for sacran solution, but the resulting hydrogels were not self-standing
presumably due to too high porosity. To impart toughness to porous
hydrogels, we then freeze-dried the hydrogels in the water-swollen
state instead of solution.

Results and Discussion
Pore Formation in Hydrogels
We made the porous sacran
material using the freeze-drying technique, which is a conventional
and simple method widely used for pore preparation in hydrogels.34 The rationale was that sacran, having an ultrahigh
molecular weight (>20 MDa) and a rigidity high enough to exhibit
an
LC phase, where sacran chains are intrinsically self-oriented in a
very low concentration (>0.3 wt %) as stated in Introduction, might demonstrate the ability to form strong
networks of hydrogels.
First, the sacran solution was simply subjected to freeze drying to
form spongy materials (representative picture, Figure S2a) and then the spongy sacran was annealed at 60
and 140 °C to examine the thermal-cross-linking behavior in the
dried sponge state. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
sacran sponges were taken to observe the porous structure on their
surfaces, as shown in Figure S3a,b. The
pore size of the sponges annealed at 60 °C was about 6.0 ±
1.5 μm, which is higher than those annealed at 140 °C (2.3
± 0.9 μm). The pores created by freeze drying shrunk with
successive annealing treatments, which suggested that the thermal
cross-linking occurred due to the annealing treatment as demonstrated
previously in the cast film test.35 Besides, it has been reported in
the literature that the anisotropic structure of pores was controllable
using freeze-drying technique.32 The pore
size is related to wettability of the substrate; hydrophobic substrate
produced large pores, whereas the hydrophilic one produced tiny pores.
The sponge annealed at 60 °C was immersed in deionized water
for 24 h to turn it into a viscous solution but not into gels (Figure S2b), whereas the other at 140 °C
created the intended gels after immersion in deionized water for 24
h (Figure S2c). These results indicated
that the high annealing temperature is important for the gelation
of the sacran sponges. The cross-linking junctions should be generated
by not only heating but also freeze drying.33 The swelling degree of the sacran sponges at 140 °C was 57
± 6 g/g, which is higher than that of nonporous hydrogels derived
from sacran cast films due to the pores. As discussed previously,
because sacran chains contain numerous carboxylic and hydroxyl groups,
intermolecular hydrogen bonds might be generated by annealing.36−38 Moreover, it is possible to form ester or ether bonds among these
functional groups (Figure S4). This is
why the annealing temperature of the sacran sponge affected the gelation
behavior. The pores were successfully formed by freeze drying, and
the subsequent thermal treatment method but actually the hydrogels
did not exhibit appropriate toughness. Such an unexpected result of
hydrogel brittleness could be due to randomly directed LC domains,
as illustrated in Figure 1a, where the interdomain boundary might induce the brittleness.
Moreover, thermal cross-linking of sacran chains beyond the boundaries
is probably difficult because the sacran chains are attached in different
directions. In summary, simple freeze drying of the sacran solution
is not suitable for the production of tough and porous sacran hydrogels.
Consequently, our efforts have been devoted to improving the physical
properties of porous sacran hydrogels. We developed a method for obtaining
tough sacran hydrogels using a solvent-casting method. The toughness
was induced by uniaxial orientation of the sacran chains in LC monodomains
formed through fusing small-orientation domains under interfacial
effects (Figure 1).35

for comparison to (e).

Preparation of Layered/Porous Hydrogels
The porous
hydrogels with a layered structure were prepared from the sacran LC
solution (Figure 1a).
The LC solution was dried on a flat substrate, such as plastic, to
form a cast film with an in-plane orientation of sacran chains and
then the film was thermally cross-linked at 60, 80, 100, 120, and
140 °C (Figure 1b). When the film was immersed in water, hydrogels with a layered
structure were formed, which are regarded here as original hydrogels
(Figure 1c). The porous
hydrogels were prepared by freeze drying to form sponges, which were
then reswollen in water (Figure 1e). In frozen state, the sacran network layers were
surrounded by ice crystal (Figure 1d). Consequently, pores were formed by passing water
vapor to outside of gels in sublimation of ice crystals. Freeze–thawed
examples of the original hydrogels were prepared for comparison to
those that were freeze-dried. Figures 2 and S5 show representative
SEM images of sacran films cast from an LC solution and then annealed
at 60 °C (Figure 2a,c) and 140 °C (Figure 2b,d). Regardless of annealing temperatures, the SEM images
of the top view of the film show that they are very smooth with no
particular structure (Figure S5a,b), whereas
those of the side view for cross-sectional samples (Figure 2) show striped lines, which
revealed that in-plane orientation of sacran molecules formed layered
structures in micrometer scale. In the original hydrogels, in-plane orientation inducing layered
structure was confirmed by cross-polarizing optical microscopic images
under first-order retardation plate (530 nm) (Figure S6). No distinct difference in the layered structure
on these SEM images was observed. From this observation, we confirmed
that the layered structure was formed throughout the films. The film
was swollen in water and freeze-dried to produce white sponges, whose
appearances are shown at the top of Figure 3. The sponges looked denser in the case of
the higher thermal-cross-linking temperature, which agrees with the
above-mentioned phenomenon using a sacran solution. The hydrogel structures
of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled sacran in the state of Figure 1e were observed by
confocal laser scanning micrograph (CLSM), to reveal the porous structures
(Figure S7). From the photos, the pore
sizes are approximated to 37 ± 12, 26 ± 5, 19 ± 4,
17 ± 5, and 13 ± 3 μm for hydrogels cross-linked at
60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 °C, respectively. These data also indicated
that the network density of precursor hydrogels strongly affected
the pore sizes. Differently from the literature,35 thermal treatment of dried porous film did not remove the
pores of the water-swollen hydrogels, presumably owing to the stiffness
of rigid saran chains capable of showing LC phase. Figure 4 shows SEM images of freeze-dried
samples of the original hydrogels with layered structures, where the
porous pattern can be observed only in the side view, whereas both
top and bottom surfaces show some unclear wrinkle-like structures
but no pore structures. The porous patterns can be observed in all
of the cross sections of these sponges cut by a very sharp surgical
knife, revealing the interconnection of pore structures like tunnels.
The interconnected pore structures were observed in samples cross-linked
at all annealing temperatures. The absence of pores in the top and
bottom surfaces is interesting because a simple freeze-drying treatment
induced such oriented tunnel structures. The pores were formed by
ice sublimation, and the vapor appeared to preferentially vent out
of the side faces but never break the top and bottom surfaces. This
phenomenon strongly suggests that the sacran primary layers should
be very tough intrinsically owing to strong interchain interactions.
At the same time, the wrinkled structures on the top and bottom surfaces
were formed on the surface because of the pressure change due to the
outflow of water.39 When the sponges were
immersed in deionized water, translucent hydrogels were prepared as
shown at the bottom of Figure 3. The hydrogels were somewhat opaque because of the LC phase.
As mentioned above, first, freeze-dried samples of sacran LC solutions
were annealed but failed to form porous hydrogels having layered structure.
Thus, the timing for thermal cross-linking is important to form stable
hydrogels. This suggests that sacran molecular chains should be strongly
interacted in oriented domains to make thermal cross-linking efficient.

and then thermally cross-linked at 60 °C (a, c) and 140 °C

structures. The scale bar is 10 μm.

mm.

hydrogels, which
were prepared by casting the sacran LC solution with a concentration
of 0.5% w/v and then thermally cross-linking at 60 (a, f), 80 (b,
g), 100 (c, h), 120 (d, i), and 140 °C (e, j). Side views (f–j)
reveal pore structure, whereas top views (a–e) reveal no pore
structure. The scale bar is 100 μm.

Even after immersion in water, the hydrogels still kept in-plane
orientation, which was suggested by the following test: samples were
torn from the edges of porous hydrogels by two pairs of tweezers and
fracture regions were observed. When they are torn, the hydrogels
were not very smoothly fractured to get rough fracture area, whereas
regular hydrogels are very easily broken by such a strong twisting
stress. Figure 5 shows
representative photographs of the fracture area of the hydrogels derived
from the films thermally cross-linked at 60 °C. One can see many
steps in the fracture areas marked by dotted lines in Figure 5a, strongly suggesting the
layered structure formation in hydrogels. The hydrogels produced by
a freeze–thawing method, which is widely used to prepare hydrogel-type
tissue engineering scaffolds and so on,40−44 were also prepared for comparison to clarify the
freezing effects on hydrogel structures and properties. The freeze–thawed
hydrogels also showed steps, suggesting the maintenance of the layered
structure (Figure 5b), but had no pores. They are good examples for comparison to the
freeze-dried hydrogels.

are marked by dotted lines. Both photographs show steps in the fracture
area of hydrogels suggesting layered structures.

Pore Structures
Figure 4a shows that the pores in the side face observed by
SEM seem smaller in the hydrogels prepared from the films cross-linked
at higher temperatures. The pore size was estimated from these SEM
images and found to range between 10 and 35 μm. The size was
plotted against the thermal-cross-linking temperature from 60 to 140
°C to obtain Figure 6a, showing a quantitative tendency of pore-size decrease with
increasing thermal-cross-linking temperature, which is well in agreement
with the results of CLSM. The sizes determined by SEM in the dry state
almost correspond to those by CLSM for high cross-linking temperatures.
The tendency corresponds to the shrinking of pores by thermal treatment
for freeze-dried sponges, and the layered structure remaining at 140
°C can be easily identified in Figure 4j. We therefore conjecture that annealing
the film can enhance intralayer interaction of the sacran chains to
make the layers stiff. The water vapor should make pores around the
portions where sacran chains interact weakly between layers.

Figure 6 Pore size (a)
and porosity (b) of freeze-dried samples of layered
hydrogels, which were prepared by casting the sacran LC solution with
a concentration of 0.5% w/v and then thermally cross-linking at 60,
80, 100, 120, and 140 °C. Pore size (a) was estimated from side
views of SEM images (Figure 4f–j), and porosity (b) was evaluated from the amount
of tetralin intruding into sample pores.

Figure 6b
shows
the relationship between annealing temperature and porosity, which
was measured by taking the volume of voids over the total volume inside
xerogels. If freeze-dried sponges were immersed in tetralin, which
is not a solvent for sacran chains, the sponges readily absorbed the
tetralin. This phenomenon could have occurred due to capillary effects,
allowing water to intrude through pores to hydrate the sacran chains.
The porosity values of all freeze-dried hydrogels were higher than
40% and were affected by the annealing temperature. The porosity was
79% at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. These results indicate
that the pore size and porosity in hydrogels can be controlled by
varying the annealing temperature of sacran films. Because pore structures
are important for applications such as filters,3−5 catalyst supports,6 and tissue engineering scaffolds,7,8,45 the good controllability is an
advantage in these applications. The porosity values are higher than
those reported by Nasri-Nasrabadi et al. (25–50%) on a porous
composite of starch/cellulose.46 The porous
starch/cellulose was prepared by the combination of film-casting,
salt-leaching, and freeze-drying methods. By this method, it is difficult
to use big salt particles as a porogen due to brittleness or homogeneity. The results of the method used
in the present study were characterized by large and interconnected
pores and high porosity.

Swelling Behaviors
The effect of
annealing temperature
on pore structures should have a great influence on swelling behavior.
We therefore investigated the swelling degree of porous hydrogels
with comparison to nonporous hydrogels prepared by freeze–thawing
methods. The swelling degree (Q, measured in g/g)
was determined as the weight ratio of absorbed water to dried polymer,
as shown in Tables 1 and S1. The porous hydrogel from the
film cross-linked at 60 °C showed a Q value
of 186 g/g, which decreased to 9 g/g at 140 °C. The higher cross-linking
temperature yielded smaller pores and a stronger intralayer interaction
to disturb the water-molecule absorption into the hydrogels.

b Thermal-cross-linking temperatures
of layered film as precursors of layered hydrogels.

We prepared the freeze–thawed
hydrogels to examine the freezing
effects on hydrogel properties by comparing them to original hydrogels
and to examine the drying effects by comparing them to porous hydrogels
from freeze-dried sponges. The freeze–thawed samples showed
a lower degree of water swelling than porous hydrogels at all thermal-cross-linking
temperatures (Table 1), presumably due to the strong effects of interconnected pores on
enhancing water absorption through capillary force. On the other hand,
the swelling degree of the network matrix of sacran chains was calculated
using the data on porosity, and the resulting values are shown in
parentheses. These values were lower than those for freeze–thawed
hydrogels, suggesting that the drying process also has an effect on
decreasing the degree of swelling. For the comparison of freeze–thawed
hydrogels with original hydrogels, the swelling degree increased only
slightly, indicating that freezing effects are very weak at controlling
the degree of swelling. Poly(vinyl alcohol)s (PVA) are well known
for showing the physical cross-linking accomplished by the freeze–thawing
technique.47,48 However, sacran chains have more complex structures than PVA that
avoids crystallization. Water content (A) was also
calculated to estimate the network structure quantitatively, which
will be described in detail later. In summary, thermal-cross-linking
temperature controlled the swelling behavior well in the present method
for producing sacran hydrogels.

Mechanical Properties
The mechanical properties of
swollen hydrogels were measured by stress–strain tests in elongation
mode. Generally, compression mode is widely used for hydrogel mechanical
test because the elongation mode requires an intrinsic toughness of
the samples. Figure 7a shows stress–strain curves of water-swollen sacran networks
in porous hydrogels, which were obtained by normalization of the curves
for porous hydrogels (inset of Figure 7a) using porosity. The curves show a typical shape,
including initial Hookean regions. Elongation tests of freeze–thawed
hydrogels were conducted (Figure 7b), and Figure S8 shows
the stress–strain curves of original hydrogels. Elastic modulus
(E), tensile strain at fracture (σ), elongation
at fracture (ε), and strain-energy density are summarized in Table 2, whereas the mechanical
properties and network analysis of original hydrogels are summarized
in Table S2.

E and σ were
increased because of the increase
in the cross-linking temperature. The increasing cross-linking temperature
resulted in proportionally higher E and σ values
of the sacran-layer porous hydrogels, suggesting that the establishment
of an increasing cross-linking temperature enlarged the cross-linking
point. E and σ values of porous hydrogels showed
an increasing trend from 3 kPa (60 °C) to 585 kPa (140 °C)
and from 1 kPa (60 °C) to 210 kPa (140 °C), respectively,
by an increase in annealing temperature. On the other hand, ε
values were highest at an annealing temperature of 120 °C. Thermal
cross-linking can induce strength and hardness in hydrogels, but too
many cross-linking points cause brittleness. E and
σ values of freeze–thawed hydrogels also increased from
5 kPa (60 °C) to 1745 kPa (140 °C) and from 2 kPa (60 °C)
to 758 kPa (140 °C), respectively. Porous hydrogels showed 210-
and 195-fold increases, whereas those that were freeze–thawed
showed 379- and 349-fold increases in σ and E, respectively. The difference in the rate of increases may be related
to no cross-linking inside the pores. Actually, σ and E values of sacran chain networks in porous hydrogels, which
were reestimated using matrix cross-sectional areas by subtracting
pore areas (values within parentheses in Table 2), are higher than those of porous hydrogels
but lower than those of the freeze–thawed ones, except for
the case of 60 °C annealing. The high mechanical strength of
freeze–thawed hydrogels may be attributed to interlayer interaction
breakage by the pore generation. Strain-energy density,
which can be regarded as the measure of toughness in materials science
and calculated by the area under the stress–strain curves,
showed a continual increase from 1 kJ/m3 (60 °C) to
208 kJ/m3 (140 °C) for freeze–thawed hydrogels,
whereas the porous hydrogels showed a maximum strain-energy density
of 91 kJ/m3 at 120 °C, which decreased to 43 kJ/m3 at 140 °C. This maximum value was caused by the ε-value
tendency. Although the strain-energy densities of porous hydrogels
were lower than those of freeze–thawed hydrogels, the values
were comparable to those of polymethacrylate-derivative hydrogels49 applied practically for contact lens and were
higher than those of poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels prepared using silica
nanoparticle porogens.50

Moreover,
the porous hydrogel from sacran sponges had a maximum E value of 585 kPa, which is higher than that for other
reported hydrogels derived from dextrin,51 chitosan/collagen,52 natural silk protein,53 hyaluronic acid,54 and cellulose/alginate,55 which were
prepared by chemical cross-linking. This is owing to the in-plane
orientation of the sacran LC structures.

Network structure analyses
were performed from A and E values. Table 3 summarizes cross-linking
density (Ve), molecular weight between
the cross-linking points
(Mc), molecular length between the cross-linking
points (L), and the degree of effective cross-linking
(X). When the temperature was increased from 60 to
140 °C, the values of Ve and X increased 81- and 74-fold, whereas Mc and L dropped dramatically by 82-fold for
porous hydrogels. Similarly, freeze–thawed hydrogels showed
increases in Ve and X with an increase in cross-linking temperature, but the rates of
increase were 176- and 153-fold higher than those of porous hydrogels,
respectively, whereas Mc and L decreased 174-fold. It can be seen that
freeze–thawed hydrogels had higher E values
than porous hydrogels and their water-swollen sacran networks (in
parentheses in the tables) in spite of a higher swelling degree than
those of water-swollen sacran networks. As a result, Ve and X values of freeze–thawed
hydrogels increased sufficiently to induce high toughness over 100
kJ/m3 at thermal-cross-linking temperatures of 120 and
140 °C. Owing to a layered structure, porous hydrogels retained
high toughness, although the strain-energy-density values decreased.
In the drying step, the ice was substituted by air to make pore gaps,
which broke the interlayer cross-linking; however, intralayer cross-linking
should be kept to some extent, as clearly illustrated in the SEM image
in Figure 4j. As reported
by Kováčik, not only cross-linking density but also
the pore shape and size also show a significant effect on the mechanical
properties of porous materials.56 In our
porous hydrogels of sacran LC chains, the tunnel-like pores along
the layers were very effective at keeping high strain-energy density
in highly porous hydrogels.

Conclusions
Freeze
drying of water-swollen layered hydrogels of a supergiant
LC polysaccharide, sacran, which are prepared by thermal cross-linking
of film cast over a sacran LC solution, forms pores only on the side
faces of spongy materials, where layer edges are located but no pores
are found on the top and bottom faces, as revealed by SEM. The pore
size is decreased from 35 to 10 μm by an increase in temperature
for thermal cross-linking from 60 to 140 °C depending on the
annealing temperature of the film cast. The anisotropic sponge absorbs
an oily solvent, tetralin, although sacran does not dissolve in it,
presumably owing to capillary force. From the amount of tetralin absorbed,
the porosity of the sacran sponge materials was estimated to range
between 40 and 80%, decreasing with an increase in the thermal-cross-linking
temperature of the cast films. The anisotropic sponges swell in water
to form hydrogels. The swelling degrees are estimated as weight ratios
of the water-swollen hydrogel to the dry sponge and range between
9 and 186 g/g, higher than those of the original hydrogels (8–51
g/g), indicating that the porous structures are retained in hydrogels.
The swelling degree of the network matrix is calculated to be 6–40
g/g by subtracting the amount of water in pores from the whole swelling
degree, which was lower than the nonporous hydrogels prepared by freeze–thawing
of the original hydrogels. The swelling degrees of freeze–thawed
hydrogels are between those of original hydrogels (from cast films)
and those of the network matrix, suggesting that both freezing and
successive drying are effective on additional cross-linking of original
networks. The porous hydrogels are tough enough to tear at their edges,
and many steps appeared around torn parts, suggesting that the layered
structures from the layered cast film are maintained. Elastic moduli
of the porous hydrogels range from 3 to 585 kPa, whereas tensile strengths
at fracture range from 1 to 200 kPa. Moreover, strain-energy density
of porous hydrogels cross-linked thermally at 120 °C is high
at around 91 kJ/m3. The high toughness might be attributed
to pores arranging between the layers and not reducing the mechanical
toughness when the gels are stretched along the longitudinal direction
of the layer.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Sacran
was dedicated from Green Science Material
Inc. (Kumamoto, Japan) and used as received. Tetralin and FITC were
purchased from TCI, Japan.

Hydrogel Preparation
Hydrogels used
here were prepared
by the procedure shown in Figure 1. First nonporous sacran hydrogels were prepared as
precursors for porous ones by a previously reported procedure.35 The sacran aqueous solution with a concentration
of 0.5% (50 mL) prepared by agitating at 80 °C for 8 h was cast
into a polypropylene case (50 × 50 × 50 mm3)
and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 72 h to form translucent films
with a thickness of 44 ± 9 μm. The films were punched into
disklike samples with a diameter of 5 mm and thermally treated at
60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 °C, to cross-link the sacran chains
in a dry-film state. When the films were immersed in deionized water
at room temperature and kept for 24 h, the translucent self-standing
hydrogels were of an almost constant diameter, whereas the thickness
was increased.

Next, porous sacran hydrogels were prepared by
the following procedure. The precursor hydrogels were frozen by keeping
in liquid nitrogen for about 10 min and then drying in a freeze-drying
apparatus (EYELA, FDU-1200) for 72 h. We were able to confirm their
complete drying because the samples spontaneously attached to the
glass wall by electrostatic force. As a result of freeze drying, spongy
materials were formed. When the sponges were immersed in deionized
water, self-standing hydrogels were recovered.

For comparison,
nonporous sacran hydrogels were additionally prepared
via the following freezing procedure. If the precursor hydrogels frozen
by keeping in liquid nitrogen for about 10 min were thawed by leaving
at room temperature for 1 h, the hydrogels were recovered. The obtained
hydrogels were immersed in deionized water and kept for 24 h to reach
an equilibrium swelling state. The freeze–thawed hydrogels
were used for comparison to those that were freeze-dried because the
former have a simple layered structure with no pores.

CLSM observation
(CLSM, FV1000D, Olympus, excited by 488 nm laser
and detected the emission signal at 559 nm) of the hydrogels was made
using FITC-labeled sacran, which was prepared as follows. FITC was
mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of sacran and then the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. After DMSO was
thoroughly diluted by dialysis with replacing the external pure water
repeatedly, the inner solution was poured into acetone to get fibrous
samples. The samples were collected and dried in vacuo, to get FITC-labeled
sacran. The pore structure was analyzed by checking the dark parts
of the images.

Pore-Size Measurement
SEM (JEOL,
JCM-6000PLUS) was
used to investigate the sample structures. The samples were mounted
onto metal stubs using carbon tape. The stubs were then coated with
gold using a sputter coater machine. ImageJ analysis software was
used to determine the averaged pore sizes of 20 randomly selected
samples. Three different images of one freeze-dried sample were used
for the calculation of mean pore size.

Porosity Measurement
Porosity was evaluated using the
tetralin displacement method as follows. Freeze-dried samples were
cut into 5 mm diameter disklike samples and then immersed in tetralin,
which is a slightly viscous solvent with a high boiling point. After
keeping the samples for 3 days, the weight was measured by an electronic
balance. The porosity was then evaluated by the equation 1  where Wd is the
dry weight, Ws is the weight in the swollen
state, and Vs is the total volume of the
swollen sample. The density of tetralin, ρtetralin, was 0.97 g/cm3. The evaluations were repeated five times
and the data were averaged.

Swelling Properties
The degrees
of swelling were measured
by the following method. The weights of dry precursor films or sponges
were measured before hydrogel formation. The hydrogels swollen in
an equilibrated state were weighed after the water on the sample surfaces
was removed by wiping. The degree of swelling (Q)
was evaluated by the ratio of the swollen weight (Ws) to the dry one (Wd) 2  The water content (A) of
the hydrogels was also evaluated by the following equation 3  The values of five specimens were averaged.

Mechanical Properties of
the Hydrogels57−59
The
mechanical properties of the sacran hydrogels were investigated in
an elongation test. The elongation probe was set up on an Instron
3365 machine using a 5 kN load cell with a crosshead speed of 1.0
mm/min. Elastic modulus (E) of each sample was calculated
using the following neo-Hookean equation applied to unidirectional
elongation measurements 4  where τ is the stress, F is the applied force, A is the original cross-sectional
area of the hydrogels, E is the elastic modulus,
and λ = h/h0, where h is the hydrogel length under strain and h0 is the hydrogel length before elongation. Plotting F/A versus (λ – λ–2) resulted in a straight line with a slope of E, which is the modulus of elasticity of the swelling hydrogel.

The effective cross-linking density (Ve) was calculated from the swelling ratio and modulus using the equation 5  where E is the elastic modulus, Q is the swelling degree, R is the gas
constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the
hydrogels.

The average molecular weight between cross-linking
points (Mc) was calculated using the cross-linking
density,
as shown in the following equation 6  where ρp is the density of
the dry polymer (sacran ≈ 0.83 g/cm3).

The
average molecular length between cross-linking points (L) was calculated using the molecular weight between the
cross-linking points, as shown in the following equation 7  where L0 is the
molecular length of the polymer repeating unit (8.6 Å) and M0 is the molecular weight of the polymer repeating
unit.

The degree of cross-linking (X) can be
estimated
theoretically using Mc, as given in the
following equation 8
