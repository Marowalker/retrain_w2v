Neutral, flexible ditopic phosphine
(P–P) or phosphine oxide
(O=P–P=O) donors, rigid anionic bis-chelating
oxygen donors, and Re2(CO)10 were used to assemble
ten phosphine oxide (P=O)-donor-based neutral monocyclic M2LL′-, bicyclic M4L2L″-,
and bicyclic M4LL′2-type supramolecular
coordination complexes (SCCs). A soft ditopic phosphine donor was
transformed into a hard ditopic phosphine oxide donor, during the
formation of the cyclic complexes 1–3, 5–6, and 9–10. Complexes 4, 7, and 8 were obtained using a hard P=O donor ligand. These SCCs were
characterized using elemental analysis, FTIR, NMR, and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis. The absorption properties of 1–8 were studied using absorption UV–vis
spectroscopic methods, and the results were analyzed using theoretical
calculations. The results revealed that the neutral P=O donor significantly influenced
the photophysical
properties by enhancing the absorption coefficient in the visible
region.

Introduction
Designing supramolecular
coordination complexes (SCCs), using various
preprogrammed metal-based acceptors and organic-donor frameworks,
has gained considerable research interest in the past two decades
because of their potential applications in various fields including
host–guest encapsulation, catalysis, and medicine.1−8 Among the available metal-directed approaches, the fac-Re(CO)3-core-based method is one of the well-known processes
for synthesizing heteroleptic SCCs with various sizes, shapes, and
functionalities.2−5 Owing to their high significance in several important areas, research
is being channeled toward synthesizing new SCCs with improved properties
and designing a one-step synthetic approach for multicomponent assembly.
In this direction, ditopic phosphine oxide donors have been recently
introduced in place of neutral ditopic nitrogen donors, which are
one of the few organic-framework-building units in heteroleptic rhenium(I)-based
SCCs.6a It is noteworthy that phosphine
oxide donor ligands have been used as bridging ligands between the
metal centers in metal–organic polymers and discrete lanthanide-based
complexes.7−11 However, the use of the P=O-donor-based ligands as framework-building
units for a discrete rhenium(I)-based SCCs is limited.6a In addition, the idea of using hydroxyl/carboxyl
groups as the sources of neutral and anionic oxygen donors is quite
popular now for synthesizing the SCCs.1−8 However, the use of oxygen donors from the P=O unit for synthesizing
the SCCs is rare.6−8 Although the P=O donor can coordinate like
the nitrogen donor, the electronic differences between these two donors
result in SCCs with different photophysical properties. Initial results
revealed that moving from the N-donor- to the P=O-donor-based
building units significantly increases the absorbance of rhenium(I)-based
cyclic complexes.6a As a continuation of
our previous approach, that is, mixing Re2(CO)10, rigid bis-chelating HO∩O–O∩OH donor (H2-L = H2-CA = chloranilic acid), and flexible phosphine
(P–P)/phosphine oxide (O=P–P=O) donor
for the development of the P=O-donor-based strong visible-light-absorbing
SCCs (Scheme 1),6a we plan to modulate a spacer and an organic
group attached to phosphorous of flexible organic ligands and the
substitution on bis-chelating O donor that would expectedly result
in similar SCCs with different photophysical properties.

Scheme 1 Synthetic
Approach to a P=O-Donor-Based SCC from the P Donor6a
Herein, we report the preparation and characterization
of seven
neutral monocyclic SCCs 1–7 and three
bicyclic SCCs 8–10. The complexes 1–3, 5–6, and 9–10 were obtained by treating
the neutral ditopic phosphine donors [1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane,
L1; 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, L2; 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)benzene,
L3], bis-chelating HO∩O–O∩OH donor
(chloranilic acid, H2-CA; 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone,
H2-DHBQ; tetrahydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, H4-thq),
and Re2(CO)10 in a one-pot approach.6a In this method, the soft phosphine donor was
used as an indirect starting material for the oxygen donor ligand,
which in turn got transformed to a hard phosphine oxide donor during
the reaction (Scheme 1). Complexes 4, 7, and 8 were
obtained using 1,4-bis(dimethylphosphoryl)-2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzene
(L4) or 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(dimethylphosphoryl)benzene (L5) as a neutral hard phosphine oxide donor, H2-CA/H2-DHBQ, and Re2(CO)10. The complexes
were characterized using elemental analysis and 1H- and 31P-NMR spectroscopic methods. The molecular structures of
the SCCs were further analyzed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis. The absorption properties of 1–8 were examined using UV–vis spectroscopic methods
and were analyzed using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
calculations.

Results and Discussion
Complexes 1–10 were prepared by
treating Re2(CO)10, a phosphine donor (L1/L2/L3)/phosphine oxide donor (L4/L5), H2-CA/H2-DHBQ/H4-thq·xH2O, and mesitylene/toluene
using a solvothermal method (Schemes 2 and 3). The complexes were
stable in air and moisture. Complexes 1–8 were soluble in polar organic solvents, whereas 9 and 10 were sparingly soluble. The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 1–10 displayed
a single sharp chemical resonance peak in the range of δ 27–30
in DMSO-d6 (Figures S1–S7), indicating the presence of single symmetrical
complexes. The disappearance of the peak at δ −11, which
corresponds to the phosphine P of L3, and the appearance
of the new peak at –δ 27 for 3, 6, and 10 indicated the presence of O=P–CH2–C6H4–CH2–P=O
building units in these complexes. This observation indicated that
the highly oxophilic phosphine ligand could be transformed into phosphine
oxide, in the presence of air under solvothermal conditions.12 The free ligand also exhibited a peak at δ
28, corresponding to the P=O donor unit. This clearly confirmed
that the starting phosphine donor was transformed into phosphine oxide.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Bicyclic SCCs 9 and 10
Compared with those of the
free ligand, the 1H NMR spectra
of 1–10 showed very clear chemical
resonance peaks both in the aromatic and in the aliphatic regions
(Figures S8–S14). In particular,
the protons of the methylene −CH2– group
showed a doublet (∼δ 3.8), with a coupling constant of
13.8 (JPH), consistent with the presence
of the phosphine oxide donor unit in the complexes 3−4, 6−8, and 10.13 A similar chemical resonance peak
of CH2 was also observed in the case of free 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)benzene
dioxide and its coordination complex.13

Crystal
Structures of Metallacycles 1–5 and 7–10
The molecular
structures of 1–5 and 7–10 were proved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figures 1–3 and S15–S17, and Tables S1–S3). Both solvothermal
and recrystallization methods did not yield good-quality crystals
of complex 6. Complexes 1–5 and 7 would be represented as a [1 + 1] assembly, that
is, a single molecular clip [{(Re(CO)3)(μ-L)(Re(CO)3)}] capped by a ditopic O=P–P=O ligand.
Complex 1 adopted a pseudorectangular structure (Figure S15), which was similar to complex I.6a The neutral O=P–P=O
donor unit coordinated the molecular clip using its two oxygen atoms
and took a syn conformation mode with anti-cofaciality. The rhenium
atom adopted distorted octahedral geometry and was coordinated with
three carbon atoms and three oxygen atoms.

Complexes 2 and 5 were isostructural
(Figure 1A,B). Because
of the boatlike conformation of the [{(Re(CO)3)(μ-L)(Re(CO)3)}] motif in 2 and 5, the structures
of these complexes differed slightly from the dinuclear complexes I and 1. Although the CA2–/DHBQ2– moiety was planar in the complex, this unit was below
the plane of Re···Re atoms. The two O=P groups
(O11=P2–P1=O12 for 2 and O5=P1–P2=O6
for 5) pushed the CA2–/DHBQ2– moiety from the plane of Re···Re atoms in 2 and 5. The distance between the two rhenium atoms in
the [Re(μ-L)Re] unit was 7.84/7.87 Å, which was significantly
shorter than that for complexes I and 1 (dRe···Re = 8.08/8.08 Å for I/1). In both the complexes, the O=P–P=O
donor unit acted as a molecular clip and adopted a syn-conformation.
The conformation of O=P–(CH2)3–P=O in this complex was comparable with that of the
uncoordinated ligand, except for the parallel arrangement of the two
phenylene units.13 Because of the metal
coordination, the bond distances of P=O in these complexes
were marginally longer than that in the free phosphine ligand.

In complex 3 (Figure S16),
the bis-chelating CA2– unit was slightly twisted,
that is, deviated from the planarity. However, the coordination mode
and the bonding nature of the CA2– unit were similar
to those of the same moiety in complexes I and 2. The O=P–CH2–C6H4–CH2–P=O unit acted
as a molecular clip and adopted an anti-conformation with respect
to the plane of the central benzene core. The free ligand O=P–CH2–C6H4–CH2–P=O
also took a similar arrangement.13 The
bond distances of P=O (1.508 and 1.512 Å) were slightly
longer than the bond distances found in the free ligand (1.482 and
1.488 Å),13 which indicated that the
coordination of P=O with rhenium was responsible for the bond
elongation. The central benzene plane was vertical to the plane of
the CA2– unit (dihedral angle = 90°), and its
arene CH group (C13-H) was directed toward the center of the CA2– unit (dH···centroid = 2.8350 Å). The distances between P···P, P=O···O=P,
and Re···Re were 7.690, 6.707, and 8.148 Å, respectively,
which suggested that the ditopic O=P–CH2–C6H4–CH2–P=O donor
was an ideal molecular-coordinating clip to the [{(CO)3Re)(μ-CA)(Re(CO)3}] unit. It is known that a ditopic
phosphine oxide unit acted as an eight-membered chelating ligand in
Er-L3-based complexes.13

In complexes 4 and 7, the planar CA2–/DHBQ2– unit coordinated two rhenium
atoms symmetrically (Figure S17). The coordination
mode and bonding nature of the CA2–/DHBQ2– unit were similar to those of the same moiety in complexes I and 1. The phosphine oxide unit adopted a syn
conformation with respect to the plane of the central benzene core
and coordinated as a molecular clip. The central tetramethylphenylene
core was closely parallel (dihedral angle = 29°/36°) to
the plane of the CA2–/DHBQ2– unit.

Complex 8 adopted a M4L2L′-type
bicyclic structure and was composed of four fac-Re(CO)3 moieties, two DHBQ2– units, and a neutral
tetratopic O=P donor unit (Figure 2). The complex was regarded as the [2 + 1]
assembly product of two molecular clips, [{(Re(CO)3)(μ-L)(Re(CO)3)}], bridged by a bis-ditopic P=O donor ligand. The
three six-membered rings (DHBQ2–···benzene···DHBQ2–) are arranged like a ladder (distance (centroid)
= 4.26 Å; dihedral angle = 37°). The bonding nature of both
DHBQ2– and L5 in the complex 8 was normal and was similar to the bicyclic complex II.6a

Complexes 9 and 10 adopted a M4LL′2-type bicyclic
structure and thus could be
regarded as [1 + 2] assembly products with one [{(Re(CO)3)(μ-thq)(Re(CO)3)}] and two O=P–P=O
units (Figure 3).6a The rhenium atom in the complexes adopted distorted
octahedral geometry, with a C3O3 donor environment.
The hexadentate 12-electron donor thq4– unit used
all its oxygen atoms to coordinate with four rhenium atoms and adopted
two μ2:η1:η2:η1 modes. The delocalization of π-electrons in the C6O6 ring was separated into two parts, [complex 9, part 1: (−O19–Re4–O18–C29–C30(O19)–C31–O20–Re1–O19)
and part 2: (−O22–Re3–O21–C32–C33(O22)–C34–O17–Re5–O22);
and complex 10, part 1: (−O5–Re2–O6–C35–C36(O5)–C37–O4–Re1-O5)
and part 2: (−O2–Re3–O1–C32–C33(O2)–C34–O3–Re5–O2)],
and confined to two chelating motifs, which were again separated by
two C–C single bonds (complex 9: C29–C34/C31–C32
= 1.493/1.474 Å; and complex 10: C35–C34/C37–C32
= 1.503/1.500 Å). The average (av) of the C–C and C–O
bond distances of the thq4– unit (av C–C
= 1.417 Å, av C–O = 1.306 Å) in these complexes and
that of the free H4-thq unit (av C–C = 1.438 Å,
av C–O = 1.317 Å) and complex II (Scheme 2)6a were similar, which confirmed that the C6O6 ring was a tetra-anionic motif.14,6a

Each O=P–P=O donor unit adopted a syn-conformation
and bound two rhenium cores in these complexes. However, the choice
of the two metal cores by the O=P–P=O donor among
the four metal centers in the [{(CO)3Re}4(μ-thq)]
core was different from complex to complex. The spacer, −(CH2)3– and −CH2–(C6H4)–CH2–, present in the
P=O donor unit played an important role in the selection of
the two metal ions in the [{(CO)3Re}4(μ-thq)]
motif.

In complex 9, the molecular clip of O=P–P=O
donor units coordinated two rhenium atoms, which were separated by
four atoms [part I (black color): Re4–O18–C–C–O17–Re5
and part II (blue color): Re1–O20–C31–C32–O21–Re3
in Figure 3A]. These
two rhenium cores were not located in the fused bis-chelating motif,
and this led to the formation of the 13-membered cyclic core in the
complex. Two such cyclic systems, one above and the other below the
plane of the [((CO)3Re)4(μ-thq)] motif,
were present in complex 9. In complex 10, O=P–P=O donor units coordinated two rhenium
atoms that were separated by only one oxygen atom [part I (black color): Re2–O5–Re1 and part II (blue color): Re3–O22–Re5] and were the part of the
fused bis-chelating motif. Each cycle in complex 10 gave
rise to a 12-membered monocyclic ring. It is worth mentioning that
the bridging nature of the two O=P–(CH2)4–P=O donor units of the [((CO)3Re)4(thq)] motif in M4LL′2-complex III was different from the bridging nature of P=O donor
units in complexes 9 and 10 (Scheme S1). The central benzene core was vertical
to the plane of the thq4– unit in complex 10, and its arene CH group (C5-H) was projected toward one
of the edges of the thq4– unit (dH···centroid = 2.8350 Å). In addition
to that the intramolecular edge-to-face C–H···π
interactions were found between the two oppositely arranged phenylene
units of the O=P–P=O motif (dcentroid···centroid = 4.89 Å and dihedral
angle = 84°; Figure 3).

Photophysical Studies of Complexes
The dinuclear complexes 1–7 and
the tetranuclear complex 8 showed a broad and structureless
visible-light absorption
band covering the entire visible spectrum (350–710 nm) in THF
(Figure 4, Table 1). The complexes also
displayed an UV absorption band centered at ∼300 nm. The spectral
patterns of these complexes (1–8)
were similar to those of complexes I and II, with minor shifts in the absorption maxima in the visible region.6a On the basis of previous studies, the broad
low-energy absorptions in these complexes were assigned to a mixture
of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions (MLCT, Re →
CA2–/DHBQ2–) and ligand-centered
(intraligand charge-transfer, ILCT and/or ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer,
LLCT) electronic transitions. The high-energy bands can be assigned
to the ILCT and LLCT transitions.

Assignment of spectral bands was further confirmed
by TDDFT calculations
using a THF solvation model (Figures S18 and S19; Tables S4–S11). The visible-light
absorptions of 1–7 were largely ascribed
to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs)
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In the HOMOs, the
electron density was predominantly localized on the Re atoms, with
a significant electron distribution on the three CO groups and the
CA2–/DHBQ2– units; the contribution
from the phosphate group is negligible. The electron density of the
LUMO was localized over the CA2–/DHBQ2– units (91%). This observation clearly indicated that MLCT (Re →
CA2–/DHBQ2–), LLCT (CO →
CA2–/DHBQ2–), and ILCT (CA2–/DHBQ2– → CA2–/DHBQ2–) transitions were responsible for the absorption
at longer wavelengths. The higher-energy transitions at ∼306–338
nm occurred mainly because of the ligand transitions with minor contribution
from the MLCT transitions (Re → CA2–/DHBQ2–). A close inspection of the relevant molecular orbitals
revealed that the electron density of the HOMOs was predominantly
localized over the O=P–P=O and/or the DHBQ2–/CA2– units. The electron density
of the LUMO was localized on the CA2–/DHBQ2– units. These studies clearly indicated that the higher-energy transitions
for complexes 1–3, 5, and 6 occurred because of a combination of ILCT (DHBQ2–/CA2– → CA2–/DHBQ2–) and LLCT (phenylene of O=P–P=O
→ CA2–/DHBQ2–). Complexes 4, 7, and 8 displayed higher-energy
LLCT (phenylene of O=P–P=O → CA2–/DHBQ2–) transitions.

Complexes 9 and 10 showed a broad absorption
between 400 and 600 nm. A similar absorption was found in complex II possessing O=P–P=O and thq4– units. The visible absorption range of 9 and 10 was smaller than those of the other complexes.

Compared
with free H2-CA (λmax = 442
nm, ε = 264 M–1 cm–1) and
H2-DHBQ, these complexes exhibited red-shifted absorptions
with several-times-higher molar absorption coefficients. All complexes
displayed strong absorptions (ε > 10 000 M–1 cm–1) in the visible region, except for complexes 3, 5, and 6 (ε < 6000 M–1 cm–1). These results further indicated
that the absorption maxima (λmax) in the visible
region were blue-shifted by 12–18 nm on replacing the CA2– unit by a DHBQ2– unit in complexes 1–8; no influence was observed while changing
the phosphine oxide donor unit. Furthermore, the molar absorption
coefficients (ε) of the complexes at λmax ≈
500 nm were significantly enhanced/reduced either by replacing the
CA2– unit by a DHBQ2– unit or
by tuning the methylene spacer of the O=P–(CH2)n–P=O (n = 4 or 3) donors in complexes I, 1, 2, and 5; no smooth trend in the molar absorption
coefficient of the complexes was observed by either of the two changes.
However, replacing O=P–(CH2)n–P=O (L1 or L2) by O=P–CH2–mC6H4–CH2–P=O (L3), possessing an arene spacer, dramatically reduces the ε
values in the visible region. Replacing CA2– with
DHBQ2– did not affect the molar absorption coefficient
in complexes 3 and 6. This result indicates
that the arene spacer in the complexes plays a significant role in
decreasing the ε value, probably because of the noncovalent
interactions between the arene spacer and the bis-chelating unit in
complex 6. Close inspection of the molecular structure
of 6 clearly indicates the CH···π
interactions between the arene and the CA2–/DHBQ2– moiety.

For the phosphate ester-donor-based
complexes 4, 7, II, and 8, replacing CA2– by DHBQ2– enhances the molar absorption coefficient
remarkably. These results further imply that both the phosphate ester
group and the anionic unit influence the photophysical properties
of complexes 4, 7, II, and 8. Complexes II and 8 displayed
higher ε values than complexes 4 and 7, probably because of the presence of nearly two units of 4 and 7 in complexes II and 8, respectively.

Conclusions
The P=O-donor-based
SCCs, containing rhenium(I)carbonyl
cores, bis-chelating O∩O–O∩O donors, and ditopic
phosphine oxide donors, linked to butyl, propyl, xylene, or substituted
xylene, were reported. Using a one-pot multicomponent solvothermal
approach, these SCCs were synthesized by a spontaneous transformation
of the soft phosphine into a hard phosphine oxide, in the presence
of a bis-chelating oxygen donor ligand and Re2(CO)10. Direct combination of O=P–P=O, bis-chelating
oxygen donor ligand, and Re2(CO)10 resulted
in the formation of phosphine oxide-donor-based SCCs. The formation
of the reported SCCs 1–8 experimentally
supported the fact that the proposed synthetic approach was feasible.
The results confirmed that a change to a neutral oxygen donor of phosphine
oxide from a neutral nitrogen building unit significantly improves
the absorbance of the SCCs in the visible region. In addition, the
results predicted that the P=O donor of the ester ligand is
a suitable building unit to make strong visible-light-absorbing rhenium-based
SCCs. The construction of SCCs using ditopic/tritopic/multitopic P=O
donors with conjugated spacer and acyclic complexes with different
organic groups on P are under way.

X-ray Crystallography
Intensity
data of crystals of 1–3, 5, 7–8, and 10 were
collected on a Bruker D8 Quest
diffractometer [λ(Mo Kα) = 0.71073 Å]. Intensity
data of 4 were collected on an Oxford Xcalibur S diffractometer.
Intensity data of 9 were collected on a Rigaku Saturn
724+ CCD diffractometer. The structures were solved by direct methods
using SHELXS-9717 and refined using the
SHELXL-2014/7 program (within the WinGX program package).17b,17c Non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. Some of the lattice solvent
molecules could not be modeled, and hence their contribution to the
intensities was excluded using the SQUEEZE option in PLATON.17d The crystallographic data of 1–5 and 7–10 are
provided in Tables S1–S2.

Computational
Section
The atomic coordinates were obtained
from the X-ray crystal structures of 1–5 and 7–8. The ground-state geometry optimizations
of 1–8 were performed in the gas
phase using the B3LYP method. A Stuttgart–Dresden (SDD) basis
set for the rhenium atom and the 6-311G* basis set for all other atoms
were used using the Gaussian 09 program package.18−21 Geometry optimizations were achieved
without any constraints. To exactly analyze the absorption spectra,
UV–visible spectral analysis for vertical excitations from
the ground state was computed using TDDFT using the IEFPCM (integral
equation formalism polarizable continuum model) solvent model with
THF. The TDDFT analysis was carried out, and the B3LYP functional
and SDD/6-311G* basis set for 1–8 were used in the optimization step. A total of the lowest 100 singlet
excited states and their corresponding oscillator strengths were determined
using a TDDFT calculation for 1–8. The GaussSum programs were used to calculate the percentage contribution
of various groups and the electronic spectral simulation.
