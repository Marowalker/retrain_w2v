A unique combination
of well-established synthesis procedures involving
chemical cross-linking, careful solvent exchange to water, and subsequent
freeze drying is used to produce ultralight (4.3 mg/mL) and highly
porous (99.7%) cellulose diacetate (CDA) aerogels with honeycomb morphology.
This versatile synthesis approach is extended to other nonaqueous
polymers with hydroxyl functionalities such as cellulose acetate propionate
and cellulose acetate butyrate to produce a single component polymer
aerogel. These aerogels demonstrate a maximum water and oil uptake
of up to 92 and 112 g/g, respectively. The honeycomb morphology provides
a maximum compression strain of 92% without failure and reaches a
compressive stress of 350 kPa, for 4 w/v % CDA aerogels (4%), which
is higher than that reported for cellulosic aerogels. The 4% CDA aerogel
were rendered hydrophobic and oleophilic via chemical vapor deposition
with organosilane. The modified CDA aerogel surpasses their counterparts
in maintaining their mechanical integrity for fast oil cleanup and
efficient oil retention from aqueous media under marine conditions.
These aerogels are identified to be reusable and durable for a long
period.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Kistler,
in 1931, prepared the first aerogel by supercritical drying
of the solvent in the gel.1 Subsequent
development of supercritical CO2 drying process made aerogel
synthesis relatively fast and safer.2 However,
it was not until NASA’s stardust mission, which captured high-speed
cosmic particles using silica aerogels, that aerogels gained media
attention in 2006.3 Many novel aerogels
have been synthesized since then, including carbon nanotubes,4,5 graphene,6,7 quantum dots,8 polyimides,9 cellulose,10 and nanocellulose.11,12 The definition of aerogels
also developed over time. However, an important feature shared by
all aerogels is the removal of the solvent from wet gel with minimum
shrinkage to give high pore volume, usually higher than 90%.13,14

Even though a plethora of aerogels have been reported in the
last
decade, not much work has been carried out on single-component polymer
aerogels. Polymers have been used largely as a reinforcing material
to improve elastic properties of inorganic aerogels.15−17 In addition, although single-component aerogels from aqueous-based
polysaccharides such as alginate, pectin, starch, chitin, chitosan,
agar, and cellulose have been synthesized, their wet strength is questionable.14,18 Polyurethane aerogels are one of the earliest synthetic polymer
aerogels reported, which are formed by polycondensation of isocyanates
and alcohols.19 The isocyanates are, however,
generally toxic and very reactive, which may sometimes prove hazardous
to the surroundings.20 Meador and co-workers
have worked extensively with nonaqueous polyimide aerogels and have
demonstrated improved mechanical properties for these aerogels.9,21 In this study, we demonstrate single component aerogel synthesis
from a different class of polymers, namely, cellulose esters, that
are nonaqueous polymers with hydroxyl functionality.

Cellulose
esters are polymers derived from the abundantly available
cellulose but are easy to process than their parent cellulose owing
to reduced intramolecular hydrogen bonding.22 The aerogel synthesis approach is developed on cellulose acetate,
which is extended to cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and cellulose
acetate butyrate (CAB), exhibiting a wide-range capability of this
approach. Surprisingly, there have been few attempts at making aerogels
from cellulose esters. Tan et al.23 prepared
aerogels by urethane linkage of cellulose acetate and cellulose butyrate
followed by supercritical drying. The study was later reproduced by
Rigacci and co-workers with cellulose acetate aerogels.24,25 However, both of these efforts produced aerogels with high density
(>0.1 g/mL) and low pore volume (<90%). The aerogel synthesis
process
usually involves solvent exchange prior to supercritical CO2 drying to replace water in the pores with a solvent that has high
affinity for liquid CO2 such as acetone or ethanol. Here,
we propose an alternative method where the gel is prepared in acetone
but a solvent is exchanged to water prior to freeze drying. This approach
produces ultralight cellulose acetate aerogels (4.3 mg/mL) with high
pore volume (>99%). Moreover, the 4 w/v % cellulose acetate (4%)
aerogel,
with a density of 24.3 mg/mL, demonstrates unprecedented mechanical
properties with a maximum compression strain of 92% without failure
and a compressive stress of 350 kPa, which is higher than that reported
for cellulosic aerogels.

Furthermore, 4% cellulose diacetate
(CDA) aerogels selectively
separate oil from a simulated spill in water without any observable
disintegration of the material. The oil spill is highly detrimental
to our ecosystem, and the prevalent technologies proposed to deal
with oil spills, such as oil skimming, in situ burning, mechanical
containment and utilization of dispersants, solidifiers, and degrading
microorganisms,26−31 are either inefficient or environmentally unfriendly. In this type
of scenario, the use of sorbents is attractive because it is easy
to deploy and do not generate byproducts. However, commercially used
polypropylene mats that suffer from low sorption capability (typically
less than 10 g/g of substrate) are difficult to recover (they are
not buoyant) and are not biodegradable. Here, we have shown that the
cellulose acetate aerogels present an attractive option for oil-spill
remediation owing to better wet strength, impressive mechanical integrity,
durability, fast oil uptake, and oil retention under marine conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
We begin by describing the formation
and properties of a CDA aerogel.
The versatility of the synthesis procedure is demonstrated by extending
it to CAP and CAB. This is followed by conversion of CDA aerogels
into their hydrophobic and oleophilic analogues, which are examined
for their performance in simulated oil-spill remediation.

2.1 Aerogel Synthesis and Properties
Aerogel formation
occurs in a three-step sequence starting with the
synthesis of the organogel (gel in acetone), which is converted into
a hydrogel (gel in water) and then into the final form (aerogel). Figure 1a shows the first
step in the process in which the organogel is formed by the cross-linking
reaction via ester linkages between hydroxyl groups in CDA and anhydrides
of pyromelletic dianhydride (PMDA). While the formation of strong,
self-standing gels at low CDA concentration (4 w/v %) (Figure 1a) indicates good cross-linking,
direct evidence comes from the comparison of Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra (Figure 1b) of the aerogel with that of CDA flakes. The main differences between
the two FTIR spectra are (a) out of plane angular vibrations of aromatic
sp2 C–H bends (from 690 to 900 cm–1) and (b) aromatic C=C stretch (∼1500 cm–1). These two peaks indicate the presence of aromatic cross-linker
in the aerogel. Also, the lack of paired bands for C=O stretch
(indicative of anhydride groups between 1800–1830 cm–1 and 1740–1775 cm–1) suggests that all PMDA
reacted with the CDA hydroxyl groups. A slight broadening of O–H
stretch at 3476 cm–1 is assigned to the increased
number of O–H bonds via the carboxylic groups formed. The strong
acetyl C–O and alkoxy C–O peaks at 1220 and 1032 cm–1, respectively, indicate the presence of C–O–C
stretching in the glucopyranose ring. These peaks combined with prominent
carbonyl peak (C=O stretch) at 1736 cm–1 confirm
the presence of ester groups in CDA. The peaks at around 2950 cm–1 are because of sp3 C–H stretch,
and the peak at 1368 cm–1 corresponds to C–H
bend.

Figure 1 (a) Proposed cross-linking reaction between CDA chains and cross-linker
PMDA with the image showing the gelation of CDA solution into acetone-based
organogel after the gel was set for 24 h and (b) FTIR spectra of CDA
flakes and aerogels.

We then examine to what extent the organogel swells (or shrinks)
as we transition it to its final aerogel form via the intermediate
hydrogel state, by measuring its density at each stage. Such information
is important to understand the underlying structural changes a material
undergoes during aerogel formation, an area in which very little work
exists. Table 1 shows
the densities of the organogel, hydrogel, and aerogel together with
the aerogel pore volume, which are further depicted in Figure 2a. The organogel and hydrogel
densities were calculated by assuming that all of the liquid was replaced
with air without changing the volume of the gel (see Supporting Information for calculations).

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of the
measured and the calculated density of organogels
and hydrogels assuming that all solvents were replaced with air while
maintaining the size of the gel. Data for 2% hydrogel density are
not reported because the high swelling of the respective organogel
during the solvent exchange made the hydrogel fragile for handling
during measurements, (b) image of the 2% aerogel (density 4.3 mg/mL)
on a dandelion leaf, (c) compressive stress–strain profile
for 4% aerogels with the maximum compressive stress of 350 kPa and
maximum strain of 92%. It is to be noted that the desired shape of
the 2% aerogel was difficult to synthesize owing to the breakage of
the gel during the sequential solvent exchange process. Hence, the
compression testing of 2% aerogel was not performed. Along the same
lines, owing to the relatively high concentration of polymer in 6
and 8% CDA gels, the final aerogel product for these gels have unavoidable
artifacts during solvent exchange and freezing steps. The stress–strain
curve for the 6 and 8% aerogels are not reported here. However, we
found that both the 6 and 8% aerogels consistently yielded below 30%
strain (Figure S3). Inset of the SEM image
shows the radial cross-section of 4% CDA aerogel and (d) water uptake
and kerosene oil uptake (g/g of aerogel) as exhibited by the different
aerogels.

Table 1 Density Values and
Aerogel Pore Volume
 	2%	4%	6%	8%	
organogel
density (mg/mL)	20.0	40.3	60.7	81.4	
hydrogel density (mg/mL)	 	19.3 ± 1.6	50.8 ± 1.2	93.3 ± 2.1	
aerogel density (mg/mL)	4.3 ± 0.7	23.4 ± 1.0	77.2 ± 1.6	110.2 ± 1.2	
aerogel pore volume (%)	99.7 ± 0.1	98.2 ± 0.1	94.1 ± 0.1	91.2 ± 0.1	
Several features are evident from the data. First, the bulk densities
of the 2 and 4% aerogels are much lower than the calculated organogel
density, unlike that for the 6 and 8% aerogels. The smaller density
is likely due to the extensive swelling of the gels during gradual
solvent exchange with water, along with small shrinkage during freeze
drying. Second, we find (Figure 2a) that the 4% hydrogel does not exhibit appreciable
shrinkage during freeze drying, as indicated from a very small increase
in the aerogel density from hydrogel density. By contrast, the 6 and
8% hydrogels exhibit a large shrinkage during freeze drying. Third,
the 8% CDA gels seem to shrink during the solvent exchange (whereas
the 2, 4, and 6% gels swell during the solvent exchange). This observation
is consistent with the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited
by CDA, which is expected to be stronger at the high CDA concentration
that limits solvent penetration. Finally, owing to its extensive swelling,
the 2% aerogel is ultralight and highly porous (density of 4.3 mg/mL
and pore volume of 99.7%, Figure 2b). This is one of the lightest reported cellulose-based
aerogels (see Table S2, for comparison).

The morphology of the aerogels was examined using a scanning electron
microscope. The radial cross-section of the 4% aerogels shows irregularly
shaped pores formed by filmlike walls of the assembled CDA [scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 2c, inset]. The image reveals that the pore
size is dictated by the rate of freezing.22 Water in the hydrogels nucleate forming ice crystals that squeeze
out the cross-linked CDA polymer and compress them into thin walls.
The crystals then sublime during the drying process leaving behind
cylindrical pores with an average diameter of 50 μm. The CDA
aerogels exhibit a low Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area (3.4 m2/g) as compared to aerogels obtained
from other cellulosic sources likely because of the large pore size
of the aerogels. Figure S1 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm for the aerogel along
with the pore size distribution in the inset. The lack of any distinct
peak below 500 Å indicates the lack of micro- or mesoporosity.
Assuming that the CDA aerogel is composed of cylindrical macropores,
with a diameter range of 50–100 μm running throughout
the aerogel along the radial axis and the wall thickness of 1 μm
(Figure S2), we calculate the surface area
to be in the range of 1.6–3.2 m2/g, which agrees
well with the value measured by N2 adsorption (see Supporting Information). This agreement further
supports the lack of microporosity in the aerogel.

The porous
morphology, including thin-walled structures observed
in the cross-linked CDA aerogels, results in highly compressible systems
(see compressive stress–strain curve of 4 w/v % CDA aerogel, Figure 2c). Cross-linking
a gel with relatively high polymer concentration gives an aerogel
with a maximum compressive strength of 350 kPa, which is larger than
the values reported for cellulosic aerogels (see Table S1). In contrast to the brittle behavior of silica aerogels,32 the 4% CDA aerogel exhibits a high compression
strain (92%) without failure. The high compression strains are generally
comparable to carbon nanofiber aerogels and are higher than those
of the cellulosic aerogels reported.12,33−36 Interestingly, the 4% aerogel does not exhibit any yielding, suggesting
that the relatively high concentrations of CDA used during synthesis
(4 w/v %) renders strength and high compressibility to the aerogel.

Given the high pore volume and the closed cell morphology, the
CDA aerogels are expected to perform ideally for liquid uptake, as
confirmed experimentally (Figure 2d) for oil and water uptake. The 2% aerogels showed
the highest water sorption of 92 and 112 g/g of aerogel, although
capillary forces caused their collapse during evaporation. The 4,
6, and 8% CDA aerogels, however, were strong enough to sustain the
capillary forces. The liquid uptake recorded for CDA aerogels in this
study is comparable to the liquid uptake reported for nanocellulosic
aerogels (see Table S2 and references therein). Figure S4 shows the liquid uptake (oil and water)
relative to the available pore volume. The marginally higher water
uptake compared with the available pore volume in 4, 6, and 8% aerogels
suggests a significant finding in that sorption may take place both
in the pores and on the polymer. Moreover, a ratio of oil uptake less
than 1 may imply entrapment of air bubbles during sorption.

To demonstrate the versatility of our aerogel synthesis approach,
CAP and CAB aerogels were synthesized. Both of these are nonaqueous
polymers where some of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by propionate
and butyrate functional groups (Figure S5). SEM images of 4% CAP and CAB aerogels are shown in Figure 3a,b, which exhibit a honeycomb
structure similar to that observed before for the CDA aerogel. Yet
again, we were able to prepare one of the lightest single component
polymer aerogels starting from a relatively high concentration of
4 w/v %. The density and the pore volume of CAP were measured to be
13.0 ± 0.9 mg/mL and 99.0 ± 0.1%, respectively. The density
of CAB was slightly on the higher side, that is, 27.9 ± 3.2 mg/mL
but still 10 times lower than that reported for the earlier cellulose
ester-based aerogels.23,24 Compared with CDA aerogels, the
4% CAP and CAB aerogels exhibit lower water uptake (Figure 3c) because of increased hydrophobicity
arising from longer carbon chain functional groups, namely, propionate
and butyrate. The oil uptake is the highest for CAP owing to the largest
available pore volume, validated from Figure 3d, where the liquid uptake is normalized
with the available pore volume, and for oil uptake, the ratio is ∼0.8
for all three types of aerogels. The similar morphological and bulk
characteristics of CAP and CAB aerogels to CDA aerogels suggests that
the mechanical properties of CAP and CAB aerogels will not be much
different from that of CDA aerogels. Hence, they were not measured.

images of the respective aerogels. (c) Water and oil uptake by the
three types of aerogels. (d) Liquid volume uptake normalized with
the available pore volume per gram of the aerogel for all three aerogels.

The low density, high pore volume,
and impressive mechanical property
of cellulose ester aerogels offer a strong potential for their use
in cleaning oil spills by selective uptake of oil from water. The
unmodified CAP and CAB aerogels may be ideal for selective separation
of oil. However, we selected 4% CDA aerogels to test for the further
studies of oil-spill remediation to identify whether the comparatively
less hydrophobic CDA aerogels have the potential to be rendered more
hydrophobic and oleophilic by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with
an organosilane. This may expand the scope of these cellulose ester
aerogels.

2.2 Aerogel Modification To Reduce Water Uptake
To increase the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of CDA aerogels,
the CVD with trichloro-octylsilane (TCOS) was used to cap free hydroxyl
functionalities with the hydrophobic chains. As shown in Figure 4a, a water droplet
completely wicks through the surface of the unmodified 4% CDA aerogel,
whereas a modified 4% CDA aerogel shows a water-contact angle exceeding
120° on both surfaces of the aerogel (Figure 4b1). Moreover, the fact that the transverse
cross-section of the modified aerogel exhibits a high water-contact
angle (Figure 4b2)
indicates that TCOS diffuses below the surface of the aerogel, rendering
the bulk aerogel hydrophobic. In general, all observed contact angles
for the modified aerogels were greater than 120°. Note, however,
that the typical large variation in contact angle values is due to
the uneven surface on the aerogel. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey scan of the top surface and transverse cross-section
of the modified aerogel (Figure S6a) further
confirms the diffusion of TCOS into the bulk of the aerogel. The calculated
Si/O at. % at the top surface and in the center is 19 and 2 at. %,
respectively. It is likely that the diffusion of TCOS inside of the
bulk of the aerogels can be further increased by increasing the CVD
exposure. However, a 2 h exposure to TCOS proved sufficient as the
modified aerogels (2 h CVD) retained their hydrophobicity for months
as indicated by the high water-contact angle on their surface (>120°)
and the low water uptake (<3 g/g of aerogel, Figure 4c). It is to be noted that the samples were
stored under the atmospheric condition for 4 months. This reflects
the stability and durability of the modified aerogel over a long period.

the surface of the unmodified CDA aerogel, high water-contact angle

aerogel, (c) water uptake by the modified aerogel just after silanation
(t = 0) and the same aerogel sample after 4 months.
Inset images demonstrate high water-contact angle on the modified
aerogel surface, and (d) the graph demonstrates that the modified
aerogel retains its hydrophobicity even after 48 h.

The samples of the modified and unmodified 4% CDA
aerogels were
subjected to water sorption test for 48 h, with their behavior monitored
after placing them on the surface of water. The unmodified CDA aerogel
quickly sorbed water, between ∼35 and 40 g/g aerogel in the
course of approximately 48 h, whereas the TCOS-modified CDA aerogel
was hydrophobic and sorbed less than 3 g/g aerogel during the same
time period (Figure 4d). These data demonstrate that the modified aerogel is stable and
retains its hydrophobicity even after constant exposure to water for
48 h.

2.3 Oil Separation
The TCOS-modified
4% CDA aerogel was tested in various scenarios of oil-in-water systems
to evaluate their liquid uptake properties and mechanical integrity.
The model oil used in these studies was a spent kerosene grade oil
(viscosity of ∼1–2 cP). A sample of 0.26 g of the modified
aerogel was placed into a jar, which contained 10.5 g of oil and about
59.4 g of water. The photographs of Figure 5a show the process of the selective sorption
over time of the oil from the oil/water mixture by the modified aerogel.
The aerogel was saturated with oil within a minute, as shown in Figure 5a(ii,iii). The oil-loaded
aerogel was hand-pressed, as shown in Figure 5a(iv), to recover the oil and was reused
to remove the oil remaining in the oil/water mixture, as shown in Figure 5a(v,vi). Movie S1 demonstrates the separation of oil from
the oil/water mixture. The mass balance of the liquids from the separation
shown in photographs of Figure 5a is shown in Figure 5b. The weight of the water, oil, and aerogel was measured
before the experiment, and the weight of the oil pressed from the
aerogel was measured after the experiment. The weight of the used
aerogel and the remaining water was measured to complete the mass
balance. The data shown in Figure 5b show that about 83 wt % of the kerosene oil was recovered,
with the unrecovered oil staying trapped in the aerogel. In addition,
the water sorption by the CDA aerogel was negligible (about 0.02 wt
%), which suggests that the recovered oil could be reused.

Figure 5 (a) Snapshots
from Movie S1 demonstrating
the separation of spent kerosene oil from oil/water stagnant media.
Reusability of the aerogel is demonstrated in the figure; (b) graph
for the mass balance of the water and oil before and after separation
indicating the complete removal of oil with very negligible sorption

of sorption and desorption (by mechanical compression) of n-hexane; (d) snapshots from Movie S2 to demonstrate the separation of dyed kerosene oil from oil-in-water-stirred
system (kerosene: 6 g, deionized (DI) water: 100 g, aerogel: 0.26
g, and stirring rate: 500 rpm); and (e) snapshots from Movie S3 demonstrating the separation of high
viscosity spent motor oil from motor oil/water-stirred system to model
oil spill in a turbulent sea (motor oil: 7 g, DI water: 100 g, and
aerogel: 0.35 g). Upper photographs show the side view of the beaker
used for the study prior to the addition of the modified aerogel (“initial
system”; upper left photograph) and an overhead view of the
instant that the aerogel was added to the beaker (t = 0 s; upper right photograph).

No major changes in the aerogel structure were observed after
multiple
cycles of sorption and mechanical compression. The reusability of
the modified aerogels was tested via n-hexane sorption
and desorption by mechanical compression (Figure 5c). We found that a TCOS-modified 4% CDA
aerogel can be subjected to at least 10 cycles of sorption and compression
before undergoing structural failure. As shown in Figure 5c, the modified aerogel can
sorb over 25 times its weight of n-hexane in the
first cycle and can still sorb about 10 g of n-hexane
per gram of aerogel even after 9 cycles of sorption/compression.

The modified aerogels were further tested under shear conditions
in an oil-in-water medium (Movie S2). The
spent kerosene was dyed red for better observation. Figure 5d shows the photographs to
indicate that a clear solution is obtained within a minute because
nearly all of the dyed oil is soaked up by the modified aerogel. The
modified aerogel retains both oil and its mechanical integrity even
in the stirred media, indicating its utility for oil-spill cleanups
in the agitated media. To further simulate high viscosity oil spill
in a turbulent environment (typical in marine environments), a stirred
oil-in-water system was prepared (Movie S3), in which the oil used was spent motor oil (spent car oil with
a viscosity of about 170 cP). As indicated by the photographs of Figure 5e, the modified aerogel
sorbed all of the high viscosity motor oil within 2 min, even in the
stirred media.

The rate of oil uptake was measured via wicking
experiments using
a tensiometer (CAHN DCA-312). The aerogels were cut into a cuboid
shape and lowered into the liquid (see Figure 6a). Extreme care was taken to cut the aerogels
in one direction to ensure that the pore alignment was same in all
measured samples. The bottom edge (surface) of an aerogel was submerged
1.5 mm below the surface of a given liquid to ensure continuous contact
of the aerogel with the solvent during the course of the experiment.
Kerosene oil, crude oil, and motor oil were the liquids used with
viscosity 1.4, 10, and 168 cP, respectively. Figure 6b shows the liquid uptake rate by the modified
aerogel. We observe that the low-viscosity kerosene oil wicks the
modified aerogel instantaneously, in contrast to the high-viscosity
motor or crude oil. Motor oil with the highest viscosity has the slowest
liquid uptake rate, as expected. The maximum uptake of crude oil is
the highest, as crude oil (0.97 g/cm3) has a higher density
than kerosene oil (0.8 g/cm3). It should be noted that
the wicking rate of any oil can be further tuned by changing the surface
energy of the aerogel with other compounds such as fluorocarbons.
The liquid uptake can also be tuned by changing the pore size of the
aerogel, which in turn can be altered by controlling the freezing
rate. These surface and bulk modifications are, however, subjects
of further studies.

3 Conclusions
A versatile
method to synthesize a single component polymer aerogel
from a nonaqueous polymer with hydroxyl functionality is presented
and demonstrated with cellulose esters. A unique combination of chemical
cross-linking, solvent exchange, and freeze drying process was used
to produce ultralight (4.3 mg/mL) and highly porous (99.7%) CDA aerogels
for the first time. A low density cellulose ester aerogels (<30
mg/mL) were easily synthesized even with a relatively high starting
concentration of the polymer (4 w/v %). The honeycomb morphology was
provided by 4% CDA aerogels with high compressive strength (up to
350 kPa) and maximum strain of about 92%. These 4% CDA aerogels could
be modified to render them hydrophobic and oleophilic and can be potentially
used to selectively clean oil from oil spills in the rough marine
environments.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
CDA (acetyl: 39.8% and
hydroxyl: 3.5%), CAP (propionyl: 42.5% and hydroxyl: 5%), and CAB
(butyryl: 46% and hydroxyl: 4.8%) were provided by the Eastman Chemical
Company and used as received. Acetone (99%), ethanol, triethyl amine
(TEA), TCOS, and the cross-linking agent 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic
acid (also known as PMDA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DI water
was used. Dry ice was prepared in the laboratory using a liquid CO2 cylinder with a siphon tube bought from Airgas (NC). All
solvents used for wicking measurements were 99% pure and were bought
from Sigma-Aldrich. Spent kerosene oil and motor oil together with
Texas crude oil were used for experimental purposes.

4.2 Gelation of Cellulose Esters
CDA
gels were synthesized using a PMDA cross-linker as reported earlier.37 Briefly, a homogeneous solution of CDA in acetone
was formed by stirring it in a 100 mL Pyrex bottle for 24 h. The stoichiometric
amount of PMDA required for complete cross-linking was calculated
by assuming that one PMDA molecule reacts with two hydroxyl groups
on different CDA chains (Figure 1a). The CDA/PMDA molar ratio of 2:1 is required for
complete cross-linking, but for this study, CDA/PMDA molar ratio of
8:1 was used to prevent the formation of a rigid cross-linked structure
and to have free hydroxyl groups available for further modification.
CDA solutions (2, 4, 6 and 8 w/v %) with the PMDA cross-linker were
stirred for approximately 5 h to ensure complete dissolution. To this
solution, 0.5 vol % of catalyst TEA was added while stirring for another
30 s. The solution was then transferred to a cylindrical mold and
allowed to set into a gel for 24 h. Thereafter, the obtained organogels,
hydrogels, and aerogels are referred to by using the concentration
of the initial CDA solution (2, 4, 6, and 8%). The 4% CAP and CAB
gels were prepared similarly.

4.3 Solvent
Exchange
The acetone-gelled
cellulose ester was subjected to sequential solvent exchange steps
to gradually replace acetone with DI water. The gel was placed in
a mixed solution of acetone and DI water; the volume of the DI water
was five times the volume of the gel and was replaced every 12 h to
allow enough time for the gels to reach equilibrium with the solution.
A total of six such exchanges were performed with the following ratios
of acetone/DI water used in sequence: 90:10, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75,
10:90, and 0:100. After the final exchange, the gel was kept in DI
water for 24 h. This gel in water is termed as hydrogel.

4.4 Aerogel Synthesis
The hydrogel was
frozen by completely immersing the gel in a dry ice/ethanol bath for
20 min. The frozen hydrogel was then transferred to a lyophilizer
(Labconco FreeZone 2.5 Freeze Dryer) operating at −53 °C
and 0.113 mbar, which is lower than the triple point of water.38 The freezed hydrogel was dried for ∼24
h to obtain the aerogel.

4.5 Aerogel Modification
The CDA aerogels
were subjected to CVD with TCOS to convert them hydrophobic and oleophilic.39 A bottle-in-a-bottle setup was used for this
purpose (Figure S6b), where TCOS was kept
in the smaller container, and the aerogel was kept on a wire mesh
atop. The system was kept in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h.

4.6 Density, Pore Volume, and Surface Area
Aerogel density
(ρa) was calculated by measuring
its mass and volume. The aerogel was cut into cuboidal shape using
a sharp clean blade. The mass of this cut aerogel was measured using
an analytical balance, Fisher Scientific Accu-225D, which has the
least count of 0.1 mg, and the volume was determined by using the
dimensions (digital Vernier caliper). It is to be noted that the 2%
aerogel was cut into small cuboidal shapes to measure its volume.
Average density is reported after five measurements. The pore volume
of the aerogels was calculated using eq 1 1  where
ρa is the bulk density of aerogel,
ρCE is the bulk density of cellulose esters, 1.3
g/mL for CDA, 1.27 g/mL for CAP, and 1.2 g/mL for CAB.40

The BET surface area was measured by N2 absorption and desorption isotherms using Micromeritics ASAP
2020. About 0.1–0.2 g of the sample was first degassed for
3 h at 115 °C prior to the analysis. BET analysis was carried
out for a relative pressure of 0.01–0.3 at −196 °C.

4.7 Chemical Analyses
FTIR in the attenuated
total reflectance mode (FTIR-ATR) was conducted using a PerkinElmer
spectrophotometer. Samples were analyzed using the PIKE MIRacle accessory
equipped with a GE crystal. The spectrum was collected for 256 scans
and corrected for background noise. The multipoint baseline correction
was realized for each spectrum.

4.8 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Imaging
was recorded using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM),
FEI Verios 460L. The aerogels were fractured under liquid N2 using a sharp clean blade to image the radial cross-section. The
samples were fixed on the metal stub using a double-sided carbon tape.
The as-prepared SEM samples were coated with a 5 nm layer of gold
and platinum to capture secondary electrons from the surface and thus
reduce charging.

4.9 Mechanical Compression
Testing
The
freeze-dried aerogels synthesized for compression testing were molded
in 20 mL syringes with a height/diameter ratio of 2:1. The top and
bottom part of a cylindrical aerogel was made smooth by using a sharp
clean blade. Compressive stress–strain curves were obtained
using an Instron Series IX with compressive loads of 0.5 N, which
were lowered at the rate of 5 mm min–1.

4.10 Sorption Test
The aerogel was immersed
in a liquid and allowed to saturate. After immersion, the surface
of the saturated aerogel was blotted with a paper wipe to remove surface
liquid and weighed. Liquid uptake was calculated using eq 2 2  where Wab and Wa are the weights of saturated and dry aerogels,
respectively. Note, for sorption of organic solvents, the blotting
step was avoided to prevent wicking of the solvent to the paper wipe.
Instead, the saturated aerogels were weighed immediately.

4.11 Reusability Tests
A representative
solvent of a low surface energy oil, n-hexane, was
used to test the reusability of modified aerogels. Loaded aerogels
were mechanically compressed between paper wipes to remove the solvent
and weighed again to ensure at least 70% of the solvent was squeezed
out. The process of sorption and compression was repeated until the
aerogel lost its mechanical integrity, which was identified when the
aerogel was not able to recoil back as observed by the unaided eye.
The average data with standard deviation are reported after repeated
tests with three different samples.
