Two different approaches
funded upon the intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition
of in situ generated o-quinone methides have been
explored to construct the central tetracyclic core of parvifolals
A/B. At the outset, a cross-pinacol coupling of 2-formyl tri-O-methyl resveratrol with 4-methoxysalicylaldehyde
followed by acid treatment was found to provide the desired tetracyclic
core with an internal olefin. The requisite pendant aryl group has
been introduced by a Pd-catalyzed direct coupling of corresponding
diazonium salt.

Introduction
The
oligostilbenes and, particularly, resveratrol derivatives represent
a class of polyphenol-based natural products of great interest from
a biological point of view, but at the same time, they display extremely
complex molecular architectures that make their syntheses a real challenge.1 In 2001, Hirai’s group reported the isolation
of two novel oligostilbenoids parvifolals A/B having an unprecedented
[6/6/5/6]-fused tetracyclic framework from the lianas of Gnetum parvifolium (Figure 1).2 Parvifolal
A (1) exhibited inhibitory activity against sbLOX-1 (IC50 1.07 μM; associated with inflammatory and hyper-proliferative
disorders) as well as promising activity in a human platelet-collagen
adhesion assay.3 The structures of parvifolals
have been established with the help of the NMR studies of their per-methylated
derivatives. From a structural point of view, parvifolals are characterized
with a fused tetrahydroindenochromene skeleton with two pendant aryl
groups having four contiguous stereogenic centers and altogether six
free phenol groups. Parvifolals A (1) and B (2) have the same constitution and are epimeric at the C8b center. On the other hand, parvifolal C is the epimer of parvifolal
B at the C7b center with an additional phenolic −OH
group on one of the pendant aryl rings. Remarkably, in spite of their
intriguing structures, no synthetic efforts toward these interesting
natural products have been documented over the past 18 years. This,
taken together with our interest on natural products with unprecedented
skeletons, led to us taking up the total synthesis of parvifolals.
In this manuscript, we document our synthetic endeavor toward the
parvifolals that narrowly missed the completion of the total synthesis,
albeit with a penultimate intermediate which upon hydrogenation was
supposed to deliver either of the per-methylated parvifolals A/B.

Results and Discussion
Our initial
retrosynthetic planning was founded upon the indigenous
methodology that has been developed for the construction of the [6/6/6/6]-tetracyclic
core present in integrastatins A/B.4 This
is a cascade process that consists of the oxidation of a benzofuran
unit to generate o-quinone methides (o-QMs)5 followed by its subsequent [4 +
2]-cycloaddition with the carbonyl group present on the C2-aryl ring.
In general, the cycloaddition results in exclusive formation of a
[6/6/6/6]-tetracyclic core. However, when the aldehyde group was replaced
with an α,β-unsaturated carboxylate group, a mixture of
[6/6/6/6]- and [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic products was obtained (Scheme 1a). The formation
of the [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic product having the intact olefin stereochemistry
endorses a concerted process, but at the same time reveals that the
conjugated olefin is not sufficiently polarized like a carbonyl where
the corresponding oxygen is sufficiently nucleophilic to add to the
methylene of o-QM.6 Considering
this observation, we hypothesized that if an electron-rich olefin
is employed, the subsequent cycloaddition should occur with complementary
regioselectivity and deliver the [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic framework.
This is going to be a challenging proposition in the current context
as the internal olefin will also be competing with oxidation of the
benzofuran ring leading to o-QM.

Oxidative De-aromatization of Benzofuran
to o-QM and Its Intramolecular [4 + 2]-Cycloaddition
with Conjugated Olefins Leading to [6/6/6/6]-Tetracyclic Systems;
(b) Retrosynthetic Disconnections of Parvifolals A/B (1/2)
Scheme 1b presents
the key retrosynthetic disconnections for parvifolals A/B. The placing
of the aromatic ring B2 was planned at the final stage
of the total synthesis via addition of the aryl anion to a carbonyl
followed by deoxygenation of the resulting alcohol group. Keeping
the proposed intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction of an in
situ generated o-QM with an internal olefin to construct
the central [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic core, the benzofuran 3 was identified as the key intermediate. The synthesis of 3 was planned from the cross-coupling of benzofuran 4 with o-bromobenzaldehyde 5 followed
by Wittig olefination.

Thus, our initial aim was set to synthesize
the advanced intermediate 3. In this direction, the starting
benzofuran 4(7) and the coupling
partner 5(8) have been synthesized
according to known
literature procedures. The cross-coupling of 4 and 5 has been executed according to Docuhet’s protocol
for direct C2–H arylation.4,9 Under the established
conditions that consists of using Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %) and
KOAc (2 equiv) in dry N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMA) at 130 °C for 24 h, the cross-coupling reaction of 4 and 5 gave the required product 6 in 31% yield, where 58% of 4 was recovered (Scheme 2). Initial attempts
to increase the conversion/yield of this reaction by varying ligands,
bases, and solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran
(THF), and dimethyl sulfoxide met with unsuccessful results. At this
stage, to check the feasibility of the originally proposed key reaction,
we have subjected the aldehyde 6 for Wittig–Horner
olefination10 with known phosphonate 7.11 The reaction proceeded smoothly
in the presence of KOtBu in THF and delivered
the benzofuran intermediate 3 in 85% yield with exclusive
E-selectivity.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Advanced Benzofuran Intermediate 3
Next, the benzofuran 3 was subjected for the Oxone-mediated
oxidation to generate the corresponding o-QM that
would subsequently undergo an intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition
reaction with stilbene unit’s olefin. Initially, the reaction
was examined by following the established protocol, that is using
Oxone (2 equiv) and NaHCO3 (5 equiv) in acetone/water (2:1)
at room temperature.4 Unfortunately, the
starting benzofuran 3 was found to be decomposed after
2 h (Table 1, entry
1). Next, the reaction was explored by varying the conditions and
using other oxidants such as dimethyldioxirane (DMDO)12 and m-CPBA at different temperatures ranging
from −78 to 0 °C (Table 1). However, in all of the reactions, either starting 3 remained intact or decomposed. These results indicate that
at lower temperatures, the epoxidation of benzofuran 3 is not facile, while at room or higher temperature, oxidation and
probably the o-QM generation take place. However,
the subsequent intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition with olefin appears
to be difficult. There could also be the possibility of competing
oxidation of olefin over the benzofuran unit.13 This prompted us to check for alternative protocols for the in situ
generation of o-QM.14

In this context, we have been reminded about our one-step
synthesis
of the [6/6/6/6]-tetracyclic core of integrastatins A/B that consists
of cross-pinacol coupling of o-phthaladehyde with o-hydroxybenzaldehyde and subsequent intramolecular ketalization
of the resulting pincol.15 By taking clues
from this established protocol, as shown in Scheme 3, we reasoned that replacing one of the aldehyde
groups of phthaladehyde with a olefin such as compound 9 and its cross-pinacol coupling with aldehyde 10 should
provide the triol intermediate that is ready for the in situ generation
of o-QM followed by intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition
leading to the required [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic skeleton. The free −OH
in resulting 11 can be oxidized to the corresponding
ketone followed by Grignard addition to introduce the remaining aryl
group.

Scheme 3 Revised Retrosynthetic Analysis of Parvifolals A/B
With this plan, the known trimethoxyresveratrol 12(16) was synthesized as reported
earlier
and subjected for Vilsmeier–Haack formylation17 using POCl3 in DMF. The desired aldehyde 9 was obtained in 74% yield along with its regioisomer 13 (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Vilsmeier–Haack Formylation of Trimethoxy Resveratrol 12
After having both
aldehydes in hand, we examined the feasibility
of cross-pinacol coupling with the established protocol, that is,
aldehydes 9 and 10 were reacted with Mg(Hg)
and TiCl4 in THF at −10 to 0 °C for 2 h.15 The expected [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic compound 11 was not observed, but the triol 14 was obtained
as a mixture of diastereomers with a moderate 49% yield (Table 2, entry 1). Various
other reagents and reaction conditions reported for cross-pinacol
coupling have been explored to improve the yield of triol 14 (Table 2). Unfortunately,
in all cases, either the starting materials remained intact or underwent
decomposition. Competing side reactions like self-pinacol coupling,
partial/complete reduction of carbonyl group, and self-/cross McMurry
coupling are expected and that results in the moderate yield of required
triol 14. Subsequently, the diastereomeric mixture of
triol 14 was treated with a catalytic amount of p-TSA in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C. Interestingly,
the reaction proceeded smoothly via tandem o-QM generation
and subsequent intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition with the olefin
group, but it was observed to undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration to
provide compound 15 with 79% yield (Figure 2a). Further, the reaction was
also examined by employing different acids such as p-TSA, TFA, AcOH, PPTS, BF3·OEt2, chiral
phosphoric acid, and ZnCl2 at different temperatures. However,
in majority of the case, the yields are low. To this end, we were
able to synthesize the crucial [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic core with essential
C7a–C8a trans-stereochemistry.

Next, we opted for
the direct hydroarylation of olefin 15 and subsequent
demethylation that could directly provide parvifolals
A/B. Initially, the hydroarylation of olefin 15 was attempted
with iodo compound 16 in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), HCO2Na, and nBu4NCl in dry DMF at room temperature for 15 h (Table 3, entry 1). However,
instead of hydroarylation, hydrogenation product 17 was
obtained (Figure 2b).
A similar result was obtained in the reaction when a triflate was
employed in place of the iodo derivative (Table 3, entry 2). Surprisingly, when the reaction
was performed in the presence of an organic base like NEt3, the isomerized product 18 was detected (Table 3, entry 4, 5). Further, several
other reaction conditions were examined for the hydroarylation of
olefin 15 by varying catalysts and coupling partners.
However, the desired hydroarylation product was not obtained (Table 3, entry 1 to 6). In
addition, the reaction conditions where hydroarylation could take
place via a free radical mechanism were also explored, but the starting
compound 15 remained intact in all cases (Table 3, entry 7 to 11).

After this setback,
a step-wise addition of the C8b-aryl
group via Heck type arylation followed by hydrogenation has been planned.
In this regard, the cross coupling of olefin 15 with
different coupling partners 16 (Table 4) has been examined either with Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 using
several prescribed ligands and bases in different solvents. In general,
either the decomposition of the starting olefin 15 or
its isomerization leading to 18 was observed. A timely report from Noël’s group on the hydroarylation
with diazonium salts came in handy at this juncture.20 Under the reported conditions
[Pd(OAc)2, MeOH–TFA, rt], the required product 19 was obtained in 56% yield (Table 4, entry 8). With the former, the yield of 19 was improved up to 61% when the reaction was carried out
without TFA and further improved up to 68% when heated the same at
60 °C for 2 h in methanol (Table 4, entry 9 and 10). Further, the arylation was attempted
with the biaryliodonium tetrafluoroborate salt 16, but
it afforded only 14% yield of product 19 (Table 4, entry 11).

After having the complete framework of parvifolals in hand, the
next task was the hydrogenation of compound 19 (Table 5). This has become
effectively impossible to address at this juncture. When hydrogenation
of 19 with 10% Pd/C in EtOAc/EtOH was carried out under
balloon pressure, the starting material was intact. When the pressure
was increased to 300 bar, the benzylic deoxygenation was the major
event and provided the indene derivative 20 in 73% yield
(Table 5, entry 3).
Use of other catalysts such as Pd/C, Pd(OH)2, Rh/alumina,
Pt/C, PtO2, Crabtree’s, and Wilkinson’s catalysts
at different hydrogen pressures, hydrogen sources and temperatures
and so forth were explored in this context, but regrettably, all reactions
were seen to be unsuccessful. The reactions with Et3SiH/Et2O·BF3 also resulted in the undesired product 20 (Table 5, entry 16). Although this failure at the penultimate stage is unfortunate,
this result, taken together with the various bottlenecks and undesired
reactions that had to be overcome at each stage, indicates that the
assembly of this molecular architecture requires more innovative reactions.

Conclusions
To conclude, a simple
approach consisting of an intramolecular o-QM [4
+ 2]-cycloaddition for the construction of the central
tetracyclic core of parvifolals has been established. Though initial
oxidative benzofuran de-aromatization was unsuccessful in delivering
the desired o-QM, at the outset, a low-valent Ti-mediated
cross-pinacol coupling and subsequent acid treatment of the resulting
triol served this purpose and provided the crucial [6/6/5/6]-tetracyclic
framework of parvifolals A/B. Subsequently, both arylation and hydrogenation
reactions were extremely challenging, as they resulted in undesired
products. Though we could address the former, we failed in addressing
the latter. Currently, work in the direction of refining the present
approach, as well as finding alternative approaches for the synthesis
of parvifolals A/B is in progress.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All reagents were purchased from
available commercial sources and used without purification. The reactions
involving air and/or moisture sensitive reagents and/or intermediates
were carried out in anhydrous solvents under an argon atmosphere in
glassware that was flame-dried. Anhydrous CH2Cl2, toluene, and DMF were distilled over calcium hydride before use.
Anhydrous THF, 1,4-dioxane, and diethyl ether were prepared via distillation
over Na/benzophenone. Methanol and acetonitrile were dried by using
Mg cake and P2O5, respectively. The purification
of all synthesized compounds was carried out via column chromatography
by using silica gel (60–120, 100–200, and 230–400
mesh). All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on 200 MHz and
or 400 MHz/500 MHz spectrometers. On the other hand, all 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 100 MHz and/or 125 MHz spectrometers
at 25 °C in CDCl3 or acetone-d6. TMS was used as an internal standard (0 ppm) and the coupling
constants (J) obtained are reported in hertz (Hz).
The splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectral data were
indicated as s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublet; t, triplet;
m, multiplet; q, quartet. The DEPT spectra were used to assign the
multiplicity of carbons in 13C NMR. High-resolution mass
of all the new compounds was obtained on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole
Mass Spectrometer equipped with an Orbitrap analyzer.

(12)
At 0 °C, a solution of stilbene 12(16) (3.0 g, 11.10 mmol) in DMF
(30 mL) was treated with POCl3 (1.56 mL, 16.65 mmol) and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 8 h at room temperature. After
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into ice
and extracted with EtOAc (4 × 50 mL). The combined organic extract
was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated, and the
resulting crude residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography
(15 → 35% EtOAc in petroleum ether) to afford two separable
regioisomers.

3,8,10-Trimethoxy-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,6a-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]chromene (15)
To a solution of HgCl2 (136 mg, 0.50 mmol)
in dry THF (5 mL), Mg (326 mg, 13.41
mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature
under argon for 0.5 h. The turbid supernatant liquid was withdrawn
by using a syringe and the remaining amalgam was washed with THF (2
× 5 mL). The resulting dull gray amalgam was taken up in THF
(10 mL), cooled to −10 °C, and treated dropwise with TiCl4 (0.96 mL, 6.70 mmol) to give a yellow-green mixture. To this
reaction mixture, a solution of aldehydes 9 (500 mg,
1.68 mmol) and 10 (305 mg, 2.01 mmol) in THF (10 mL)
was added dropwise and the purple reaction mixture was stirred from
0 to 15 °C until complete consumption of starting material was
noticed on thin-layer chromatography. The reaction was quenched by
adding saturated K2CO3 solution and the resulting
dark blue mixture was diluted with EtOAc and filtered through Celite.
The filtrate was washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure.
The crude residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography
(35 → 65% EtOAc in petroleum ether) afforded triol 14 as a mixture of diastereomers that was used directly for the next
step.

To a cooled solution (0 °C) of the above crude product
in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), p-TSA (86
mg, 0.50 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred from
0 °C to room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched
by adding saturated NaHCO3 solution and the crude product
was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL).
The combined organic layer was concentrated and the crude product
was purified by silica gel column chromatography (15 → 25%
