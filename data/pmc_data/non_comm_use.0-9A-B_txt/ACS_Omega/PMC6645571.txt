Selective formation of only one iron
oxide phase is a major challenge
in conventional laser ablation process, as is scaling up the process.
Herein, superparamagnetic single-phase magnetite nanoparticles of
hexagonal and spheroidal-shape, with an average size of ca. 15 nm,
are generated by laser ablation of bulk iron metal at 1064 nm in a
vortex fluidic device (VFD). This is a one-step continuous flow process,
in air at ambient pressure, with in situ uptake of the nanoparticles
in the dynamic thin film of water in the VFD. The process minimizes
the generation of waste by avoiding the need for any chemicals or
surfactants and avoids time-consuming purification steps in reducing
any negative impact of the processing on the environment.

Introduction
The synthesis and availability
of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)
are of general interest in many fields of research and in a number
of applications. Some common phases of IONPs include α-Fe2O3 (hematite), Fe3O4 (magnetite),
γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite), α-Fe (ferrite),
Fe3C (iron carbide), and FeO (wustite). For magnetite,
IONPs smaller than 20 nm have superparamagnetic properties and are
known as superparamagnetic IONPs.1,2 This property
relates to the large magnetic moment resulting from the coupling of
the atomic spins within the nanosized magnetite nanoparticles.3 Magnetite is one of the most intensively studied
IONPs, which can be prepared using a number of different methods,
including coprecipitation,1 sol–gel,4 microemulsion,5 ultrasonic
spray pyrolysis,6 and microwave plasma.7 They have different advantages and disadvantages
relating to shape/size control, stability, scalability, monodispersity,
and production cost. Among them, the coprecipitation method is relatively
simple and fast and has potential for scaling up; however, it generates
nanoparticles with a wide particle size distribution1 and can generate a waste stream incorporating toxic chemicals.8

Pulsed laser ablation, which can be a simple
and surfactant and
counter-ion-free technique,9 has been used
to prepare magnetic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.2 IONPs can be generated by laser ablation of bulk
iron in either the gas or liquid phase,10 the latter being the most studied,11 with
Nd:YAG laser processing at 1064 nm affording nanoparticles with enhanced
magnetic properties.2 Water is the preferred
solvent in terms of applications and environmental considerations,
with the use of organic solvents generating amorphous carbon and iron
carbide from its breakdown.8,11,12 However, selectively forming only one iron oxide phase in water
is a major challenge in laser processing.2,9,12 Also, noteworthy is that after each laser
pulse, the time taken for collapse of the plume is crucial in controlling
the nucleation and growth of the IONPs;2 longer times equate to longer growth times, affording mainly larger
particles during the ablation in the liquid. On the other hand, laser
ablation of an iron target in the gas phase can circumvent some of
the above drawbacks for liquid ablation processing, using air as the
oxidant.13 Also, noteworthy is that the
generation of nanoparticles from ablation in the gas phase is preferred
because of increased yield relative to ablation in the liquid phase.13 Maghemite has been generated by laser ablation
in a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen under atmospheric pressure,12 albeit with a broad size distribution of the
particles, 5 to 90 nm in diameter. Laser ablation processing in the
gas phase requires a more sophisticated setup with a specially designed
ablation chamber and particle collector relative to liquid phase ablation.13,14

We were motivated to integrate laser ablation in both gas-
and
liquid-phases using the versatile vortex fluidic device (VFD) in association
with an Nd:YAG pulsed laser, in developing a scalable process for
preparing magnetite in water with control over the size of particles,
and without requiring chemical additives. The VFD is a thin film microfluidic
platform that is effective in high yield and controllable organic
and material synthesis, in harnessing the intense micromixing, and
high heat and mass transfer in the dynamic film.15 Nd:YAG pulsed laser-assisted VFD processing has been used
for fabricating graphene oxide scrolls from graphene oxides16 and lateral slicing of high tensile strength
carbon nanotubes17 noting that in the absence
of the laser, the mechano-energy in the film is effective in forming
compact single-walled carbon nanotube toroids or rings.18 The VFD is also effective in enhancing chemical
reactivity and selectivity,19 intensifying
multiphase separation,20 enhancing enzymatic
reactions,21 and in many more applications.22 In the present study, the VFD was operated at
45° tilt angle for the rapidly rotating borosilicate glass tube
(O.D. 20 mm, I.D. 17.5 mm), which is the optimal angle for a number
of processes.17−22 VFD processing can be conducted on
small sub-milliliter scales in the so-called confined mode, where
there is tilt-angle-dependent shear stress, as well as being upscaled
under continuous flow, as shown in Figure 1. Polyvinyl pyrrolidine-coated superparamagnetic
magnetite nanoparticles with a mean diameter of <10 nm have been
previously fabricated using a coprecipitation method under continuous
flow using a VFD with a 10 mm O.D. glass tube in an ammonia/nitrogen
atmosphere.23 Herein, we have established
that the VFD with a 20 mm O.D. glass tube with higher volume capacity
and safer laser ablation distance is effective in forming superparamagnetic
magnetite nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution, as a one-step
continuous flow process at ambient pressure. The process is devoid
of any gas flow which simplifies the setup and minimizes the generation
of waste while avoiding the need for any chemicals/surfactants, as
well as time-consuming purification steps in reducing any negative
impact of processing on the environment.

Results and Discussion
All of the
optimization experiments were initially conducted with
the VFD operated in the confined mode with 1 mL of water. The laser
power was optimized first by conducting the experiment for 15 min
at different laser powers, 20, 70, 160, 360, and 560 mJ, as shown
in Figure 2a. Brown
suspensions, as an indicator of the formation of iron oxide particles,
were only obtained for experiments conducted at high laser power,
at 360 and 560 mJ. The suspensions have a good colloidal stability
for days, as shown in Figure 2b, in agreement with the zeta potential about +30 mV, as shown
in Figure 2e. Post-VFD
processing, the pH of the as-processed IONPs became slightly acidic
relative to the Milli-Q water, affording positively charged particles.24 As-prepared IONPs are not coated and are likely
to agglomerate in water (Figure 2d) in reducing their large surface area to volume ratio,
as reported by Demirer et al.1 Iron-based
nanoparticles lack sharp UV–vis spectrum absorption bands8 but can be characterized by an absorption threshold
for wavelengths lower than 400 nm (Figure 2c), typically representing different iron
oxide phases of hematite, magnetite, and iron carbide.8,25 The concentration of the as-prepared samples could be indirectly
estimated using UV–vis spectroscopy with high absorbance associated
with higher yield, as established by Fazio et al.25Figure 2c indicated that processing at 360 and 560 mJ generated the highest
quantities of IONPs compared to other conditions. However, the borosilicate
glass-tube VFD deteriorated with the risk of fracture using a laser
power of 560 mJ, and accordingly the lower power of 360 mJ was used.

5, respectively. (b) As-prepared sample dispersed in 1 mL of water;

Atomic force microscopy
(AFM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and XRD analyses were carried out on the samples ablated at
360 mJ, in establishing their composition and morphology. AFM revealed
large aggregates of small spherical nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 3a, in accordance
with TEM images that gave an estimated average particle of 12 nm,
with a relatively narrow size distribution. XRD established that the
material is either magnetite (COD 1011032) or maghemite (COD 9006316),
with a crystallite size of ca. 14.2 nm, using the Debye–Scherrer
equation, as shown in Figure 3b. The variation of the size estimation by XRD from TEM could
be because of the presence of strain in the crystals that can lead
to overestimation of particle diameters.26 Raman spectroscopy can be used to differentiate between magnetite
and maghemite.27 The magnetite crystal
belongs to the cubic space group Fd3m, having five Raman-active bands, A1g, Eg,
and three T2g, and four infrared active bands T1u.28 The most intense band for magnetite
(A1g mode) was observed at 662 cm–1 (Figure 3b). Three smaller
bands were observed at 192 (T2g), 313 (Eg),
and 526 (T2g) cm–1 representing the phonon
frequencies of magnetite. Two weak peaks between 1380 and 1600 cm–1 possibly correspond to graphitic material.28 The yellow color of the solution after the migration
of samples to a magnet (Figure 3a) can be ascribed to the presence of residual nanomagnetic
amorphous carbon in solution, as described by Amendola et al.8 Second-order Raman spectra are effective for
determining the crystallinity of the carbon,29 but the absence of such in this case (Figures S1 and S2) does not rule out the presence of amorphous carbon30 that could arise from traces of storage solvent
from the iron rod and fixation of carbon dioxide in the air. FTIR
spectroscopy gave a band at 550 cm–1 corresponding
to magnetite (Figure 3c), whereas maghemite has an analogous band at 600 cm–1.28,31 The black color of the samples is also consistent
with magnetite being the dominant phase.32

the VFD tube rotated at 7500 rpm for 15 min in the confined mode for
1 mL of water). (a) AFM, TEM, and size distribution plot which represented
more than 300 randomly chosen IONPs. (b) XRD diffraction pattern and

Rotational speed of the VFD tube controls the size of the
nanoparticle
(Figure 4a,b), with
the smallest size obtained at 7500 rpm, 360 mJ laser power, for 15
min in the confined mode, for 1 mL of water in the tube. The particles
were rapidly formed during the laser ablation process with the shear
presumably preventing the growth and coalescence of nanoparticles.
XRD of these samples indicates the presence of magnetite or maghemite
for all rotational speeds (Figure S3).
The weak Raman peak contribution at 720 cm–1 might
arise from a small quantity of maghemite28 at some rotational speeds (Figure 4c). Raman spectra were recorded using a significantly
low laser power to avoid the transition of magnetite to maghemite
or hematite as a result of local radiation.24,33 A well-defined Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) band at 550 cm–1 corresponding to magnetite was observed for all of
these samples (Figure S4). To scale up
the process, a continuous flow mode was used in which a syringe pump
delivered water to the base of the VFD tube through a stainless steel
jet feed. Flow rates were varied at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mL/min, and the
average size of particles derived from XRD data was 15.4 ± 1.1,
19.6 ± 1.0, and 20.3 ± 0.2 nm, respectively (Figure S5). A flow rate of 0.1 mL/min gave similar
results (15.4 ± 1.1 nm) comparable to results for the confined
mode, for 15 min processing time (14.2 nm). Thus, the processing time
in the VFD is critical for controlling the nucleation and growth of
the particles. In continuous flow mode, the solution-laden IONPs whirl
up the rotating tube, exiting through a Teflon housing unit. This
ensures more uniform processing during the laser irradiation, affording
a more monodispersed size distribution.11 Post-processing at 0.1 mL/min, deep brown fine particles were distributed
along the VFD tube (Figure S6) and were
retrieved by dispersing them into fresh water. The yield of the product
under continuous flow was estimated to be about 42 and 83 μg
per minute of samples exiting the VFD (outside) and adhering to the
inside of the VFD tube (inside), respectively. The IONPs were recovered
by placing a magnet next to the wall of the vial containing the colloidal
solution. Characterization using XRD on 0.1 mL/min sample (both inside
and outside) confirmed the presence of magnetite (Figure 4d) with an average particle
size of around 12 nm (Figure 4e1), with no evidence for the presence of other materials,
including carbon.

flow mode at 7500 rpm, 0.1 mL/min flow rate (materials exiting and

two samples obtained from continuous flow (materials exiting and retained

High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) and SAED
showed that IONPs both exiting the tube under flow and retained inside
the tube are single crystals and showed two shapes of spheres and
hexagonal prisms (Figure 5).8 Magnetite nanohexagons are
usually obtained using chemical synthesis from iron acetylacetonate
under high temperatures of up to 290 °C for extended time. However,
the average particle size for such hexagons is about 85 nm or up to
a 100 nm,32,34 whereas in our case, they are between 15
and 20 nm (Figure 5b). The generation of hexagonal particles at smaller and narrow size
range using laser ablation further highlights the significance of
our findings and the versatility of the VFD.

Figure 5 Representative TEM, HRTEM,
and SAED (marked indices are planes
of magnetite). (a) IONPs exiting the VFD operated at a rotational
speed of 7500 rpm and a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. (b) IONPs retained
inside the tube during processing at a rotational speed of 7500 rpm
and a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. Both samples showed mixed shapes of
spheres and hexagonal prisms. Both samples are single crystals with
individual crystallites highlighted. The fast Fourier transform patterns
were acquired from the HRTEM image.

Both samples exhibit superparamagnetic characteristics with
the
highest saturation magnetization (Ms)
value of about 41 A m2 kg–1 at room temperature
(Figure 6a,b),6 which is consistent with the average particle
size of about 12 nm in both samples. The slight decrease in Ms for the sample (retained) can be attributed
to the slightly disordered surface and reduced crystallinity,12,28 which could be because of the longer exposure to the laser beam.
The low-field interval of both magnetization curves reveals the negligibility
of the hysteresis which again implies the superparamagnetism.35 Apart from generating single-phase crystals,
laser-ablated IONPs prepared using the VFD have higher saturation
magnetization than those prepared using conventional laser ablation
processing in water. For example, the Ms of IONPs prepared by Vahabzadeh et al.2 in water was 14.8–22.5 emu/g with Hc of 11.5–22 Oe, which was not considered as superparamagnetic.
Maneeratanasarn et al.36 reported the generation
of amorphous α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with
a low saturation magnetization of only 1.315 emu/g using laser ablation
in water. The superparamagnetic IONPs prepared using the VFD resulted
from precise control of the oxidative states, particle size, and morphology
during the process.

samples (retained and collected). (b) Low-field interval of the magnetization
curves of the two samples.

The plasma plume that is a mixture of atoms, ions, and radicals
is generated in air and reacts immediately,37 with particles colliding with each other12 and then with uptake in the dynamic thin film in the VFD. In the
presence of a gas or liquid phase in a conventional sense, diffusion-driven
nucleation and aggregation processes play an important role in the
generation and size control of the particles.2 However, this is not readily adjustable. Experiments conducted without
any liquid in the VFD showed a significantly larger particle size
of about 20.7 nm compared to 14.2 nm when formed in the presence of
water (Table S1). To decouple the effect
of oxygen, the reaction was conducted under N2 gas (Figure S7), but this resulted in negligible formation
of iron oxide. Thus, the presence of oxygen is essential for the reaction.
Liu et al.38 reported that the rapid quenching
of species generated at high temperature using laser ablation generates
pure iron oxide species. In this context, the rapid heat dissipation
from the VFD may be important in determining the nature of the iron
oxide species generated during the processing.

Conclusions
In
summary, a novel highly selective method has been developed
for preparing single-phase superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles
directly by laser ablation of a metal iron in the presence of both
gas and liquid phases. The nanoparticles obtained under different
conditions showed spherical or hexagonal shapes, with relative uniform
average diameters of around 15 nm. Compared with conventional processes,
this method can selectively control phase composition and the size
and shape of the particles in establishing a new application for VFD.
Future experiments will investigate the fabrication of protective
coatings on the particle surface to stabilize the structure and further
improve the magnetism.

Experimental Section
The experiments
were carried out under both the confined mode and
continuous flow mode of operation of the VFD, as indicated in Figure 1. In a typical confined
mode experiment, 15 min processing time was carried out in a rapidly
rotating tube at θ 45° tilt with a simultaneously 5 ns
pulsed laser at 1064 nm (pulsed Q-switch Nd:YAG laser) with an 8 mm
diameter laser beam irradiating a high purity (>99.998%) iron rod
5 mm in diameter, which was immobilized on a stainless steel jet feed
(Figure 1a). In a continuous
flow, experiments were conducted under the same condition, as described
in the confine mode, except that stainless steel jet feeds were used
for both immobilizing the iron rod and delivering liquid into the
rapidly rotating tube (Figure 1b). Optimizing the flow rate of water involved studying 0.1,
0.5, and 1.0 mL/min flow rates, using a syringe pump. Under both processing
conditions, the laser beam was positioned perpendicular to the target
surface, with the formation of hot and high-pressure plasma plumes
containing iron atoms and ions expanding in all directions (Figure 1c,d). The laser beam
was focused about 7.5 mm away from the thin film surface with the
expanding plumes restrained within the VFD tube.

As prepared
samples were dried in the open air as per previous
studies2 and were characterized by UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50) in the 200–1000 nm range
in a quartz cell and X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 ADVANCE ECO, Co-Kα,
λ = 1.79 Å) with radiation generated at 35 kV and 28 mA
and a grazing incidence angle (3°) in the 2θ range of 20°–80°.
The lattice parameter calculations were obtained using the EVA software.
The average crystallite size was estimated using Debye–Scherrer
equation. Particle sizes/morphology and crystalline structures were
observed using dynamic light scattering (Malvern Instrument, UK),
scanning electron microscopy, TEM, and AFM. TEM was conducted on an
FEI TECNAI F20 microscope operated at 200 kV. Raman spectroscopy was
performed with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm for an integration
time of 30 s to differentiate the presence of magnetite and maghemite.
As processed materials were investigated using Raman spectroscopy
after drop-casting, one drop of the colloidal material on a glass
substrate. Magnetic measurements were carried out using a Quantum
Design PPMS with ACMS option at room temperature (295 K) by saturating
the sample in a field of up to 15 000 Oe.
