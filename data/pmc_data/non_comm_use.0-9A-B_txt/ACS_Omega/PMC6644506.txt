A nanocomposite
polyoxomolybdate (PMo12)–polypyrrole
(PPy)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is fabricated by using a simple
one-pot hydrothermal method as an electrode material for lithium-ion
batteries. This facile strategy skillfully ensures that individual
polyoxometalate (POM) molecules are uniformly immobilized on the RGO
surfaces because of the wrapping of polypyrrole (PPy), which avoids
the desorption and dissolution of POMs during cycling. The unique
architecture endows the PMo12–PPy/RGO with the lithium
storage behavior of a hybrid battery–supercapacitor electrode:
the nanocomposite with a lithium storage capacity delivers up to 1000
mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1 after 50
cycles. Moreover, it still demonstrates an outstanding rate capability
and a long cycle life (372.4 mAh g–1 at 2 A g–1 after 400 cycles). The reversible capacity of this
nanocomposite has surpassed most pristine POMs and POMs-based electrode
materials reported to date.

1 Introduction
With
the rapid increase in the global demand for portable electronic
devices, electrical vehicles, and other energy-demanding equipment,
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors have shown great
prospect for high-density energy storage systems.1 Although great efforts have been made to the rational design
of novel anode materials for rechargeable LIBs, high-power LIBs still
remain a great challenge resulting from the slow processes of Li+ diffusion. In contrast, supercapacitors work through the
redox reactions of the pseudocapacitive active materials or the formation
of electrical double-layer capacitors, but their low-energy density
hampers their application in electrochemical devices.2−4 To satisfy the increasing demand for high power density and energy
density, it is significant to design an electrode that combines the
energy of a battery and power of a supercapacitor.

Polyoxometalates
(POMs) have already demonstrated great promise
for electrochemical energy storage owing to their electron storage.5 Particularly, Awaga and co-workers revealed that
[PMo12O40]3– exhibited a reversible
24 electrons redox during charging/discharging between [PMo12O40]3– and [PMo12O40]27–.6−8 However, their application in
LIBs and supercapacitors is still hampered because the electronic
conductivity of the POMs is poor and their anions are likely to dissolve
in the electrolyte.9 To overcome this obstacle,
POMs are usually linked to conductive carbon substrates. For example,
Song et al. reported that POMs can be anchored on single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) via π–π stacking or covalent
bonding, which improved the affinity of POMs to conductive network,
leading to an increased lithium-ion capability.10,11 Graphene oxide (GO) has attracted much interest owing to its unique
properties, including chemical stability and high conductivity.12−15 It is theoretically considered that graphene possesses a higher
specific surface area than SWNTs.16−18 However, there is still
a bottleneck in the course of studies on POMs/reduced graphene oxide
(RGO) nanocomposite that the low POMs loadings on graphene results
in the poor performance because of the weak interaction between POMs
and graphene.19 Accordingly, it is still
challenging to develop the appropriate linkage between POMs and graphene.

Herein, the synthesis of H3PMo12O40 (polyoxomolybdate (PMo12))–polypyrrole (PPy)/RGO
nanocomposite (denoted as PMo12–PPy/RGO) via a one-pot
hydrothermal strategy is reported together with their applications
for high-performance LIBs. We prepared the nanocomposite by using
pyrrole (Py) to reduce PMo12 to obtain heteropoly blue,
which was further used for the reduction of graphene accompanied by
the polymerization of the Py monomer.20−23 It is proved that PPy is not
only an efficient reagent to improve the electron transport but also
relieves the leaching of POMs into the electrolyte during cycling,
leading to the enhancement of battery performance. The nanocomposite
exhibits a good cycling reversibility and achieves a high capacity
as a LIB anode, which can deliver a discharge capacity of 1082.5 mAh
g–1 at 100 mA g–1 after 50 cycles
as well as an impressive rate capability. Such an outstanding property
of the nanocomposite is ascribed to the hybrid performances, which
include both capacitive and battery behavior. Therefore, the synthesis
of the PMo12–PPy/RGO paves the way for POMs as anode
materials in LIBs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of PMo12–PPy/RGO
Nanocomposite
Scheme 1 illustrates the formation of PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite. We obtained PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite using a one-pot hydrothermal strategy by mixing PMo12, Py, and GO. PMo12 serves as a strong oxidant,
leading to the polymerization of Py, whereas PMo12 changes
to heteropoly blue, which is used to reduce GO to RGO. The PMo12–PPy nanoparticles are well distributed on the surfaces
of the RGO nanosheets (NSs), which reduces the restacking of RGO to
some extent together with creating a lot of mesopores to improve the
accessibility of Li+ and electron.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Formation of PMo12–PPy/RGO
Nanocomposite
Figure S1a shows the Raman spectrum
of the as-synthesized nanocomposite. For comparison, the Raman spectra
of pure RGO, PMo12/RGO control samples, and PMo12–PPy/RGO composite are provided. As can be observed, the pure
RGO and PMo12/RGO samples represent two typical Raman features
at ∼1351 and ∼1599 cm–1, corresponding
to D and G bands, respectively. Compared with the D band, the intensity
of the G band is apparently stronger, which indicates a higher graphitization
degree of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite. In addition,
a series of characteristic Raman peaks for PPy centered at about 931,
976, 1053, 1244, 1371, 1411, and 1588 cm–1 are observed
in the PMo12–PPy/RGO sample,24 indicating that the polymerization of Py by PMo12 is conducted well and the PMo12–PPy nanoparticles
are distributed on the graphene sheets.25 Compared with PMo12 and RGO, several new peaks originating
from PPy are observed in the spectrum of PMo12–PPy/RGO
sample from the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure S1b), where the C=C and C–N
stretching vibrations at 1558 and 1453 cm–1, respectively,
as well as the C–H in-plane ring-bending modes at 1314 cm–1 and the C–N in-plane ring deformation and
bending modes at 1182 cm–1 can be observed.26−28 In the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite, the four observed
characteristic bands centered at 1049, 931, 863, and 790 cm–1 are ascribed to P–Oc, Mo=Ot,
Mo–Ob–Mo, and Mo–Oe–Mo
stretching vibrations,20,29,30 indicating that the PMo12 component has been successfully
implanted into the final nanocomposite.

In contrast to PMo12/RGO (Figure S2a,b), the restacking problem of the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite (Figure 1a,b) is alleviated obviously and the NSs present rough surfaces and
wrinkled edges because of the polymerization of Py homogeneously decorated
with PMo12 on the surfaces of the RGO films.31−34 The corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis
(Figure 1b) reveals
that many of PMo12–PPy nanoparticles with the average
size of about 50 nm homogeneously anchored on the RGO sheets. For
comparison, we utilized the same strategy to prepare other nanocomposite
CoMo6–PPy/RGO based on analogous POMs ([CoMo6O24H6]·7H2O). The TEM
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CoMo6–PPy/RGO nanocomposite in Figure S2a,b reveal that PMo12–PPy nanoparticles tend to be
more homogeneous than CoMo6–PPy nanoparticles on
the RGO sheets. The desired spatial distribution of different elements
in the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite has been examined
by element mapping analysis. As shown in Figure 1c–g, P and Mo elements mainly exist
in the flake-sized grains; N and C elements are uniformly distributed
in the entire nanosheets. For comparison, the mappings for PMo12/RGO are given in Figure S3. The
correspoing mappings show that P, Mo, O elments of the PMo12−PPy/RGO are more obvious than that of PMo12/RGO.

(b) TEM images of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite.
(c–g) Energy-dispersive spectrometry mapping of PMo12–PPy/RGO.

The related N2 adsorption–desorption tests analyzed
the pore size distribution of the obtained nanocomposite (Figure S4b). Compared with that of PMo12/RGO and CoMo6–PPy/RGO nanocomposite, the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite has a rather larger and broader
average pore size at around 20 nm, which is a result of the spaces
between the PMo12–PPy nanoparticles. The PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite presents the largest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (91.52 m2 g–1), whereas
the BET surface areas of PMo12/RGO and CoMo6–PPy/RGO are 65.5 and 78.1 m2 g–1, respectively (Figure S4a). The larger
pore size and the higher specific surface area facilitate the rapid
mass transport of Li ions and electron transport, which are all correlated
with the increased battery performance. The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) results of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite
and PMo12 are presented in Figure S5. The initial mass loss (3.6%) below 188 °C is associated with
the release of water adsorbed on the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite and the further degradation of PPy, as well as the transformation
from PMo12 to MoO3, takes place between 188
and 560 °C (Figure S5a). We can calculate
from the TGA and experiment that the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite possesses 72.9 wt % of PMo12 and 20.43 wt
% of PPy.

The survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
spectra of the
sample before and after the cycling of LIBs demonstrate the presence
of C, Mo, P, N, and O elements in the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite (Figure S6). As shown in Figure S6b, the Mo 3d spectrum of PMo12–PPy/RGO has two peaks at 232.3 and 235.5 eV before the electrochemical
test corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Mo6+, respectively.35,36 After the discharge
to 0.01 V, the peaks at the binding energy of 231.9 eV are related
to parts of Mo4+ because of the reduction of Mo6+ (Figure S6f).37 Additionally, by deconvolution of C 1s peak (Figure S6c), the binding energy at 285 eV reveals the presence
of the C–N group in the obtained nanocomposite. The corresponding
fine XPS spectrum of N 1s (Figure S6d)
shows that the binding energy of N 1s is about 398.3 eV, implying
the existence of pyrrole N in the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite. Thus, combining the fine XPS spectra for C 1s and N
1s, the existence of PPy in the obtained nanocomposite can be confirmed.
From the XPS result, we can also observe the drop in the number of
oxygen-containing groups, demonstrating a reduction of GO.

2.2 Electrochemical Performances of PMo12–PPy/RGO
Nanocomposite
To investigate the electrochemical
activity of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite, the
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were tested at a constant scan
rate of 0.2 mV s–1 (Figure 2a). The peak at about 0.6V reflects the formation
of a solid electeolyte interface(SEI) film in the first cycle and
then the peak disappears in the following cycles.38 Although the CV curves of the first cycle are quite different
in shape due to the irreversible side reactions on the electrode surfaces
and interfaces, the subsequent CV curves are analogous. In the subsequent
scans, broad cathodic peaks centered at about 1.2 V, as well as anodic
peaks centered at around 1.6 V, are observed for the PMo12–PPy/RGO electrodes, demonstrating that the reduction and
oxidation of Mo39 (XPS results in Figure S6) is occurring during the charging/discharging
processes.

Figure 2 (a) Cyclic voltammetry measurements of PMo12–PPy/RGO

The charge/discharge profiles of the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposites for cycle numbers 1, 2, 10, and 50 are shown in Figure 2b. In the discharge
profiles, the first lithiation curve is different from the others
due to the SEI formation. It is worth noting that the curves almost
overlapped after the first discharge, which indicates the formation
of a stable SEI film and a good electrochemical reversibility of the
PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite. The capacity performance
of the three nanocomposites is displayed in Figure 2c. The PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite
showed a discharge 1777.8 mAh g–1 and a Coulombic
efficiency (CE) of 59.54% in the initial cycle. The initial irreversible
loss is ascribed to the formation of the SEI layer. In addition, the
reversible capacity of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite
can reach 1013 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles, whereas
the control samples only deliver discharge capacities of 1507.3 mAh
g–1 and the remaining capacity is 500.9 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles (PMo12/RGO) and discharge
capacities of 856.2 mAh g–1 and the residual capacity
is 270.3 mAh g–1 up to 50 cycles (PMo12). The above results demonstrate that the chemisorptions of PMo12 between the interfaces of PPy and RGO gives a superior electrode
performance in LIBs compared with that of PMo12/RGO and
pure PMo12. The capacity performance of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite is also superior to that of the CoMo6–PPy/RGO nanocomposite and the (NH4)6Mo7–PPy/RGO nanocomposite (Figure S7a). This cycling capacity is higher than most of
the pristine POMs and POMs-based nanocomposite electrodes that ever
reported (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

Because the high rate capability is beneficial to the design of
high-power-type LIBs anode materials, excellent rate performance of
the electrode is also an important aspect for evaluating many practical
application of LIBs. It can be found that the discharge capacity of
PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite remains at 1057.5, 905.9,
688.0, 510.7, and 316.4 mAh g–1 at a rate of 0.1,
0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g–1, respectively. Moreover,
when reducing the current back to 0.1 A g–1, a high
capacity of 1030.2 mAh g–1 is quickly resumed, suggesting
a good reversibility of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite
(Figure 2d). In contrast,
the CoMo6–PPy/RGO nanocomposite and the (NH4)6Mo7–PPy/RGO nanocomposite electrodes
show a faster capacity fading as the charge/discharge rates increase
(Figure S7b). In addition, a long-term
cycling is achievable for PMo12–PPy/RGO, which maintained
a capacity of 372.24 mAh g–1 after 400 cycles at
2 A g–1 (Figure S9).
For proving the structural stability of PMo12–PPy/RGO,
we performed the SEM analysis after 50 cycles at 500 mAh g–1. As shown in Figure S10, the good structural
integrity is well retained compared with the CoMo6–PPy/RGO
and the (NH4)6Mo7–PPy/RGO,
indicating the stability of the electrode.

On the basis of the
excellent performance of PMo12–PPy/RGO,
effects of different concentrations of PMo12 on the electrocatalytic
activity of PMo12–PPy/RGO-3 and PMo12–PPy/RGO-4 were investigated. As seen from Figure S8a, they showed a relatively poor capacity performance.
PMo12–PPy/RGO-1 and PMo12–PPy/RGO-2
also exhibited poor capacity performance (Figure S8b), which can be attributed to the low concentration of GO
loading with poor conductivity and low electron transfer efficiency.
In contrast, a high-concentration loading may lead to the restacking
of GO and affect the distribution of the mesopores for improving the
accessibility of Li+ and electrons.

To profoundly
explain the better performance of the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite electrodes, we carried out an analysis
of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of PMo12–PPy/RGO anode after three cycles (Figure 3a). The EIS data were analyzed via fitting
to the equivalent circuit model (the detail inset in Figure 3a).40 The R1 consists of the total resistance
of the electrolyte, separator, and electrical contacts, R2 is the charge transfer resistance, Wo is the Warburg
impedance, and constant phase element of the electrode/electrolyte
interface (CPE) is associated with the interfacial resistance. It
can be observed that the charge transfer resistance of PMo12–PPy/RGO is 90.25 Ω, which is much lower than that of
PMo12 (645 Ω). These results confirm that the incorporation
of PPy coating and RGO can be favorable to charge transfer and improve
the Li+ kinetics during the charge/discharge processes.

plots of PMo12-–PPy/RGO and microcrystal

charge storage contributions separated by cyclic voltammogram at 5
mV s–1 scan.

The reversible capacity of PMo12–PPy/RGO
is about
1082.5 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1,
whereas the theoretical capacity of PMo12–PPy/RGO
was calculated to be about 835 mAh g–1 (details
can be seen in Supporting Information).
Herein, we speculate this value exceeds the theoretical one on the
account of a hybrid battery–supercapacitor consisting of POMs,
RGO, and PPy. The battery component is caused by the reversible redox
reactions of metal ions (Mo) during the lithiation/delithiation cycles.
At the same time, the capacitive behavior also promotes the performances,
which is ascribed to RGO and PPy.41 To
investigate the electrochemical behavior of PMo12–PPy/RGO,
the CV profiles at different scan rates (0.2–10 mV s–1) were performed between 0.01 and 3.0 V (Figure 3b). The voltammetric response of the PMo12–PPy/RGO electrode was analyzed by the power law I = a × vb, where I represents the current, v is the scan rate, and a is an alterable
parameter. When b = 0.5, the electrode reaction is
regarded as a behavior that is controlled by the diffusion of Li+,41−44 whereas b = 1 indicates a surface-controlled charge
storage process. As shown in Figure 3c, it is worth noting that the b value
at 0.1 V was determined to be about 0.6349, whereas the b value at 1 V was about 0.6796, suggesting a hybrid of both. To further
understand the energy storage mechanism of PMo12–PPy/RGO,
the equations as discussed below are utilized to calculate the contributions
of the capacitance and intercalation capacity.  or  where k1v and k2v0.5 correspond to the current
contributions “i” arising from the
surface capacitive effect and
the diffusion-controlled process, respectively, at a give potential
“v.”45−47Figure 3d shows that the capacitive-controlled capacity
contributed about 27.1% of the total Li+ storage for PMo12–PPy/RGO at 5 mV s–1 (the blue-shaded
area of Figure 3d).

The superior electrode performance can be ascribed to the structure
and composition of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite.
First, the RGO films are employed here for their intrinsically excellent
conductivity; they can also be used as excellent supports. The PMo12–PPy nanoparticles can be distributed homogeneously
on the flaky RGO films, which hampers restacking among the layers,
thus relieving the structure destruction taking place in the electrodes
during cycling.48 Second, the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite shows a hybrid behavior of battery
and supercapacitor. The battery behaviors of PMo12 are
achieved by the redox of metal ions (Mo). At the same time, the capacitive
behavior also promotes the performance, which is ascribed to RGO and
PPy. Third, the porous structure of the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite offers a lot of active sites for Li+ storage,
as well as sufficient contact between the PMo12–PPy/RGO
electrode and electrolyte. Accordingly, the specific capacity and
rate capability of PMo12–PPy/RGO are enhanced.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized
the PMo12–PPy/RGO
nanocomposite through a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The charge/discharge
measurements of the PMo12–PPy/RGO nanocomposite
represent the highest capacity and the most robust charge/discharge
rate among the microcrystal PMo12, PMo12/RGO,
CoMo6–PPy/RGO, and (NH4)6Mo7–PPy/RGO. Furthermore, the PMo12–PPy/RGO
exhibits a high capacity over 1000 mAh g–1, a long-term
cycling with more than 400 cycles at 2 A g–1, and
a good rate performance. The results demonstrates that we have successfully
immobilized POMs to RGO via the wrapping of PPy and the anode materials
also exhibits a hybrid behavior of a battery−supercapacitor
for superior lithium storage, which inspires us to explore advanced
and insoluble framework materials consisting of electroactive molecule
or cluster units for Li- and Na-storage.

Nanocomposite
GO is dispersed in deionized water (10 mL)
and sonicated to form a suspension with a concentration of 2 mg mL–1, followed by the introduction of the solution of
109 μL Py in 1 mL of ethanol. Then, magnetic stirring was maintained
for about 30 min. After that, PMo12 (0.25 mmol, 0.456 g)
was added into the PPy/GO mixture with continuous stirring. The mixture
was transferred into a stainless steel vessel maintained at 180 °C
