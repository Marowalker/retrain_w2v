Hybridizing structured carbon materials with MoS2 has been demonstrated
to be an effective method to increase the electrochemical hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) activity and durability of MoS2. In this study, we report the growth of MoS2 nanosheets
on the surface of uniform hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to form a hydrangea-like
nanocomposite. The HCS were formed through carbonization of a phenol
formaldehyde template, and the MoS2 nanosheets were grown
on the HCS surfaces through a hydrothermal method. The nanocomposites
have the advantages of significantly improved electrical conductivity,
ease of varying the MoS2 loading, and minimizing stacking
of MoS2 nanosheets, which are manifested by their remarkably
improved HER performance. The well-tuned carbon–MoS2 composite shows a Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec–1, an onset potential of −0.079 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode),
and an overpotential of 126 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2 after 1000 potential cycles.

1 Introduction
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) convert chemical energy
stored in hydrogen gas directly into electricity with a high efficiency
and zero emission of pollutants and are therefore promising devices
for producing clean energy. Among other technical bottlenecks that
hinder the large-scale applications of PEMFCs are the hydrogen production
and storage.1−3 To date, nearly all of the hydrogen is produced from
steam reforming of natural gas, which is energy demanding and has
a large carbon footprint. The produced hydrogen often contains a trace
amount of carbon monoxide, which poisons the Pt-based catalysts in
PEMFCs. In contrast, electrolysis of water produces clean hydrogen. Although Pt is the most active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) due to its optimal atomic hydrogen adsorption energy,4 the scarcity and high cost of Pt limit its use
in practice. Seeking non-noble metal HER catalysts with high electrocatalytic
activity is therefore critical for the large-scale implementation
of hydrogen-related energy applications.

Many materials consisting
of non-noble transition metal (including
Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W, etc.) borides/carbides/nitrides/phosphides/oxides/sulfides/selenides
have been explored for hydrogen production.5−8 Among them, molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) with a lamellar hexagonal structure similar to graphite
has recently emerged as a very promising nonprecious metal HER catalyst
with attractive electrochemical performance in acidic electrolytes.9−13 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that only the
edges of S–Mo–S in the MoS2 sheets are active
for H* adsorption, whereas the basal plane is electrocatalytically
inert.14,15 In addition, it has also been shown that
catalysts with moderate hydrogen adsorption have a higher HER activity.4,15 Experimentally, the edge sites have been proved active sites9−11,14,15 and the catalytic activity decreases by a factor of 4.5 with each
additional layer due to the high interlayer electron transport energy
barrier.16 Different methods have been
employed to promote the HER activity of MoS2, including:
(1) boosting the electron transfer rate by changing its phase and
structure or compositing MoS2 with other highly conductive
materials;17−19 (2) increasing the active surface area and edge density
of MoS2 by alleviating the agglomeration of MoS2 sheets or constructing nanoscale architectures;20−22 and (3) introducing
heteroatoms or defects into MoS2 planes to optimize the
hydrogen adsorption energy.23−26 A combination of the above strategies has often been
used.27−33 For instance, Dai’s group synthesized a MoS2/reduced
graphene oxide hybrid catalyst exhibiting excellent HER activity,
which was attributed to the highly exposed edges of MoS2 and the excellent electrical coupling of MoS2 to the
underlying graphene sheets.34 Edge-oriented
MoS2 films were successfully fabricated by Tour’s
group through reactions of sulfur with anodically formed sponge-like
Mo oxide films on Mo substrates and showed enhanced activity and long-term
cycling stability for HER.35 By means of
controllable disorder engineering and oxygen incorporation in MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets, Xie and co-workers developed an optimized
catalyst with a superior activity for HER.36

In this study, we report the synthesis and characterizations
of
a hydrangea-like carbon–MoS2 hybrid (C–M)
with MoS2 nanosheets loosely covering hollow carbon nanospheres
(HCS) that were prepared by a facile two-step approach. The loading
of the MoS2 nanosheets can be conveniently controlled by
adjusting the weight ratio of the carbon and molybdenum sources. Due
to the minimization of MoS2 nanosheet stacking and the
enhanced electron transport through the HCS, the optimized C–M
exhibits much better HER activity than pure MoS2 nanosheets.
Furthermore, the hydrangea-like C–M hybrid exhibits superior
electrochemical stability during prolonged HER measurements. It is
anticipated that the hydrangea-like C–M hybrids may also find
applications in lithium-ion batteries and thermal therapy because
of their large surface areas and stable structures.

2 Results and Discussion
The synthesis processes for the C–M
hybrids are illustrated
in Figure 1. Uniform
SiO2 nanospheres were fabricated by a sol–gel method
using the Stöber reaction and then encapsulated with a resorcinol–formaldehyde
(RF) layer, which was transformed into a carbon shell in the subsequent
thermal annealing treatment. The SiO2 core was removed
by hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, leading to the formation of HCS
with a diameter of ∼300 nm, as demonstrated by the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure S1a. MoS2 nanosheets were then grown on the surface of HCS
via a hydrothermal process. As shown by the SEM image in Figure S1b, the surface of HCS became quite rough
after the reaction, suggesting the formation of the MoS2 layer. By varying the mass ratio between HCS and molybdenum source,
the thickness of the MoS2 layer can be tuned accordingly
(Figures S1c and S1d). These hybrids are
denoted as C–M1, C–M2 and C–M3.

Figure 1 Schematic of the synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets supported
on mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres (RF: resorcinol–formaldehyde).

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was used to further characterize
the structure of the HCS and C–M hybrids. A TEM image of HCS
is presented in Figure 2a.The hollow structure can be clearly observed, and the thickness
of the carbon layer is about 30 nm. Due to their well-defined hollow
structure, the HCS have a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of 725.8 m2 g–1 with uniform
pore sizes of about 3.2 nm (Figure S2).
The hollow carbon spheres were used as the substrate to support MoS2 nanosheets. The large surface area of the HCS provides more
attaching sites, where MoS2 nanosheets can grow, which
alleviates the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets. The ability
to control the density of MoS2 sheets in the hydrangea-like
structure by changing the mass ratio between the HCS and Mo source
is demonstrated in the TEM images in Figures 2 and S3. The hydrangea-like
structure well maintained the hollow sphere feature of HCS after being
encapsulated by MoS2 nanosheets, which is exhibited in Figure 2b,c. The MoS2 nanosheets stacked loosely on the surface of carbon spheres,
which benefits electrolyte penetration and is expected to result in
a highly effective catalytic layer. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of C–M2 are shown in Figure 2d. The lattice fringes with a d-spacing of
0.65 nm can be assigned to the (002) plane of MoS2.37 The characteristic diffraction rings in the
SAED pattern correspond to the (002), (100), and (110) planes of MoS2.38,39 The elemental distribution of C–M2 is disclosed by the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
mapping images of C, Mo, and S (Figure 2f–h). As expected, the Mo and S atoms are distributed
homogenously over the carbon hollow spheres.

c, e) C–M2. (d) HRTEM image of C–M2 (inset: its SAED pattern); (f–h) EELS mapping images of C–M2 for C, Mo, and S, respectively.

Figure 3a
shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of C–M hybrids with different
loadings of MoS2. The diffraction peak at ∼22°
can be assigned to the hollow carbon sphere,40 and the peaks at ∼33 and 58° are from the (100) and
(110) lattice planes of MoS2 nanosheets, respectively.41,42 Raman spectra in Figure 3b reveal the two characteristic peaks of carbon materials,
located at 1359 and 1596 cm–1 corresponding to the
D and G bands.43 The intensity of G band
is higher than that of D band, indicating that the carbon nanospheres
are well graphitized during the annealing process.44 The weak peaks at about 377 and 405 cm–1, respectively, agree well with the in-plane E12g and out-of-plane A1g phonon modes of MoS2 nanosheets.45,46 The two peaks at 820 and 995 cm–1 clearly seen
on C–M1 are, respectively, from symmetric and asymmetric
stretching modes of MoO3,47 which
is likely formed by the oxidation of MoS2 in air induced
by laser heating of the carbon support.48 The loading mass of MoS2 nanosheets in different samples
can be quantitatively determined by the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curves of C–M samples and the corresponding oxidation
of MoS2 in air (Figure S4).
The MoS2 contents in C–M samples were evaluated
as 42.8 wt % for C–M1, 49.4 wt % for C–M2, and 54.4 wt % for C–M3. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of C–M2 is shown
in Figure S5, in which only C, O, Mo, and
S elements were detected, confirming the purity of the samples. The
high-resolution spectra of Mo 3d and S 2p of M–C2 are shown in Figure 3c,d, respectively. The peaks at 228.7 and 232.4 eV are ascribed to
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Mo4+, respectively.
Those located at 232.5 and 235.4 eV are associated with Mo6+ resulting from the surface oxidation of MoS2 in air.
The small satellite peak around 225.8 eV corresponds to 2s of S species.49 Accordingly, the S 2p region can be deconvoluted
into two separate peaks arising from S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, which are consistent with the S2– state
of sulfur.50 The absence of a strong peak
at about 236 eV signifying the formation of MoO3 suggests
that the oxidation of MoS2 is insignificant.

The HER performance of different
samples was evaluated in a N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The
onset potential of each material was first compared. Onset potential
is the highest (for cathodic reactions) potential at which a reaction
product is formed and is frequently used as an indicator of the HER
catalytic activity. As shown in Figure 4a, the HCS sample exhibits very poor HER activity as
revealed by the absence of a significant reduction current. In contrast,
all of the C–M samples show higher electrocatalytic activities
than those of pure MoS2, clearly demonstrating the advantages
of using the HCS substrate. Among the C–M hybrids, C–M2 shows the best electrochemical activity, with an onset potential
of about −0.128 V and an overpotential of 0.198 V at the current
density of 10 mA cm–2, which are commonly used for
evaluating the electrocatalytic activities of HER catalysts.51,52 Interestingly, the performance of C–M hybrids is not monotonically
improved by increasing the amount of MoS2 in the samples.
Although the C–M3 hybrid has the highest MoS2 loading, its overpotential is nearly the same as that of
C–M1, which is probably due to the decrease of electrochemical
surface area (ECSA) of MoS2 resulting from the stacking
of MoS2 sheets. To support this assertion, double-layer
capacitance (Cdl), which is proportional
to ECSA and often used in HER studies,53,54 was measured.
As shown in Figure S6, the Cdl values are in the order of MoS2 < C–M3 < C–M1 < C–M2,
indicating that the C–M2 catalyst has indeed the
largest ECSA. Tafel analysis of HER polarization curve was then applied
to evaluate the HER kinetics. The linear part of the Tafel plots was
fitted to the Tafel equation η = a + b log(j), where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current
density.55 As shown in Figure 4b, C–M2 shows
the smallest Tafel slope of 49.3 mV dec–1 compared
with 56.3, 53.9, and 58.5 mV dec–1 for C–M1, C–M3, and MoS2, respectively,
further confirming its outstanding catalytic activity. A Tafel slope
close to 40 mV dec–1 indicates that the HER follows
the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism, which can be summarized
as the hydrogen adsorption (H3O+ + e– → Hads + H2O) and desorption (Hads + H3O+ + e– →
H2 + H2O) processes.56 Potential sweeps between 0.200 and −0.800 V at a scan rate
of 50 mV s–1 were further carried out to assess
the durability of C–M2. The polarization curves
recorded at 5 mV s–1 after a given number of potential
cycles are presented in Figure 4c. The onset potential was increasing with the cycling number,
and the current density was also increasing appreciably, indicating
that C–M2 is activated during the potential sweep
process. After 1000 potential cycles, the onset potential increased
to 0.079 V, the overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 became
0.126 V, and the Tafel slope decreased to 48.9 mV dec–1. This activation can be attributed to the increasing hydrophilicity
of C–M2, which facilitates the electrolyte penetrating
into the active sites of MoS2 and boosts the charge-transfer
kinetics of HER9 or the surface cleaning.
Upon further increasing the potential cycles, the current density
dropped slightly, presumably due to the detachment of the catalyst
from the glassy carbon (GC) electrode (GCE) and the depletion of protons
in the diffusion layer.

samples obtained in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1.

Nyquist plots acquired at −0.200 V.

To understand the improved HER activity of C–M samples,
analysis of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was carried out,
and the results are shown in Figure 4d. Only one semicircle was observed for each sample
in the Nyquist plot. From the radius of these semicircles, the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) of HER can be assessed.57,58 The Rct values of C–M hybrids
are clearly lower than those of pure MoS2 nanosheets. In
particular, the Rct for C–M2 is about half of that of pure MoS2, which can
be attributed to the less stacking of MoS2 layers arising
from the hydrangea-like structure and possibly the better electrical
conductivity of the HCS substrate that facilitates the electron transport
between the catalytic sites and the GC electrode.

To test the
long-term performance of the catalyst, chronoamperometry
measurement was also conducted at −0.250 V for a duration of
24 h, and the result is displayed in Figure 5a. The current increased from ca. 55 to 75
mA cm–2 in the first 17 h and then decreased to
about 68 mA cm–2 at 24 h. The initial current increase,
which is frequently observed in HER tests,26,59,60 might be attributed to the activation of
the catalyst, for example, removal of surface contaminants and improvement
of hydrophilicity of the catalyst. This observation is in harmony
with the improvements of onset potential and overpotential at −10
mA cm–2 after the repetitive potential cycling (vide
supra). The slight decrease of the current after 17 h of operation
may be caused by the depletion of H+ in the solution, the
accumulation of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface, or
the detachment of the catalyst aggravated by the H2 bubbling.
To examine structural stability of the catalyst, TEM and HRTEM images
of C–M2 after the chronoamperometric test were acquired
(Figure 5b,c). The
hydrangea-like structure is well preserved, demonstrating the strong
bonding between the MoS2 nanosheets and the HCS substrate.
The characteristic lattice fringe of MoS2 is still clearly
displayed in Figure 5c, confirming the good structure stability of C–M2.

Figure 5 (a) Chronoamperometric curve for C–M2 recorded
at −0.250 V. (b) TEM and (c) HRTEM images of C–M2 after the stability test.

The electrochemical performances of C–M2 are
superior to or at least close to those reported for MoS2-based materials in terms of the onset potential (η) at 10
mA cm–2 and Tafel slope, as shown in Table S1. The high HER activity and stability
of C–M2 can be attributed to the following four
aspects: (1) the good conductivity of HCS facilitates the electron
transport between the catalytic sites and the electrode substrate,
resulting in a decreased Rct; (2) due
to the support of HCS, the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets
are largely alleviated, which ensures a large amount of MoS2 edges exposed to the electrolyte during the HER; (3) the loose packing
of MoS2 nanosheets on the HCS facilitates the penetration
of electrolytes into the inner space of the catalyst, taking full
advantage of the MoS2 catalytic layers; and (4) the strong
attachment of the MoS2 on HCS guarantees the long-term
structural stability during H2 bubbling.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, MoS2 nanosheets supported
on HCS with
a hydrangea-like structure were synthesized by a hydrothermal method.
These hybrids exhibited superior electrocatalytic activities toward
HER to the pure MoS2. By varying the mass ratio of MoS2 to HCS in the synthesis, the loading of MoS2 can
be controlled. From the HER studies, it is found that moderate loading
of MoS2 nanosheets yields the best overall HER performance,
which can be attributed to the optimal coverage that provides sufficient
active edge sites yet avoids significant MoS2 nanosheets
stacking.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
of Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres
(HCS)
Mesoporous HCS were synthesized via the Stöber
reaction as reported previously.61 In a
typical synthesis process, 2 mL of ammonia aqueous solution (28 wt
%) was mixed with 6 mL of deionized (DI) water and 38.5 mL of methanol.
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 1.6 mL) was added into the above well-mixed
solution under stirring, followed by the addition of 0.2 g of resorcinol
and 0.3 of mL formaldehyde solution (37 wt %) at an interval of 10
min. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then
transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 100 °C
for another 24 h. The product was filtrated and washed with DI water
and ethanol in turn for several times. After being dried in an oven,
the SiO2/resorcinol product was annealed at 750 °C
in an Ar/H2 atmosphere for 2 h. Finally, the SiO2 templates were removed by immersing the sample in a HF solution
for 6 h and the HCS were obtained after filtration, washing, and drying
processes.

4.2 Growth of MoS2 Nanosheets on HCS
HCS (0.05 g) was dispersed in DI water
under the assistance of
ultrasonication. Sodium molybdate (0.08 g) and l-cysteine
(0.32 g) were then added into the solution under vigorous stirring.
The solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and
heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The resulting black solid was filtrated
and washed with water and ethanol successively for several times and
then dried in an oven at 80 °C (designated as C–M1). C–M materials with different carbon/molybdenum ratios
were also synthesized via increasing the amount of HCS (0.04 and 0.03
g for C–M2 and C–M3, respectively).
MoS2 nanosheets were prepared under the same conditions
without using HCS.

4.3 Materials Characterization
Microstructures
and morphologies of the samples were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using
Philips XL30 FEG and JEOL JEM-2100F FEG, respectively. Crystallographic
structures of the materials were characterized with an X-ray powder
diffractometer (D8-Advance; Bruker, Germany). Raman spectroscopy was
carried out using a Renishaw 200 Raman microscope with a 633 nm excitation
source. Surface areas of the samples were measured with nitrogen adsorption
isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Surface
chemical states of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS; VG Scientific ESCALab220i-XL). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 1 thermal
analyzer system in air.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
A CH
Instruments 660C electrochemical workstation was used to evaluate
the electrochemical HER activities of various catalysts in a three-electrode
glass cell with the catalyst-modified glassy carbon electrode as the
working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl
as the reference electrode. All of the electrode potentials are reported
with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode. For the preparation
of the working electrode, 5 mg of as-synthesized catalyst was dispersed
in a mixture of 20 μL of Nafion solution (5.0% Nafion in ethanol)
and 1 mL of ethanol. The mixture was sonicated for homogenization.
A small amount (2 μL) of the suspension was pipetted out and
dropped onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a diameter of 3
mm and then fully dried in air. Linear sweep voltammetry with a 5
mV s–1 scan rate was carried out from 0.200 to −0.800
V in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Test for the cycling stability was performed with a scan rate of
50 mV s–1 for 2000 cycles. The time-dependent current
density curve was tested at −0.25 V for about 24 h. All of
the data were obtained without IR compensation. We are aware of the possibility of Pt contaminations
on the working electrode from the dissolution of the Pt counter electrode
after prolonged potential cycling.62 However,
our previous studies following the similar potential cycling protocol
did not show the presence of Pt in energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
or XPS images.9 EIS were acquired over
a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz at −0.200 V.
