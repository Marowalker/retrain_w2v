Using
first principle calculations, we have investigated the adsorption
of CO gas on various metal-decorated phosphorene. Almost all of the
metals were considered to decorate phosphorene. By comparing binding
energy (Eb) and cohesive energy (Ec), only 10 metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr,
Ba, Pd, and La) can stably decorate phosphorene and avoid clustering.
CO adsorptions on these metal-decorated systems were calculated, and
the mechanism of interaction between CO and metal atoms was analyzed
in detail. Ea shows a significant improvement
after metal decoration, excerpt for Rb and Cs. The results imply that
Li-, Na-, K-, Ca-, Sr-, Ba-, and La-decorated phosphorene could be
used as CO elimination or reversible CO storage.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
materials have received tremendous interests
in the last decade due to their extraordinary properties, such as
ultrathin thickness and superb electric and mechanical performances.1,2 In 2014, atomic-thick 2D black phosphorus (bP), also known as phosphorene,
was successfully fabricated.3,4 It possesses a sizable
band gap ranging from 0.3 eV for bulk phase to 1.5 eV for monolayer5−7 and thus is favorable for applications in optoelectronics. Its reported
carrier mobility is up to 1000 cm2 V–1 s–1 at room temperature,3 which can be modulated by stacking a number of layers,8,9 rendering phosphorene promising for application in nanoelectronics.
The field-effect transistors based on phosphorene were also found
to possess high on/off ratio, considerable operating frequency, and
notable anisotropic transport.10−12

One of the most striking
characteristics of 2D materials is the
ultralarge surface-to-volume ratio, especially for phosphorene.13 Phosphorene forms a puckered surface, which
provides even more space to adsorb atoms or molecules, which makes
it a promising candidate for high-performance sensor or gas storage
materials. Several studies have explored the application of phosphorene
in various gas adsorption, sensing, and storage processes. However,
studies of Kou et al. showed that pristine phosphorene has small adsorption
energy for gas molecules. Even for nitrogen-based molecules with stronger
binding energy, their adsorptions have little effect on the properties
of phosphorene, such as the I–V characteristics.14 Fortunately, it was
demonstrated that the defect or metal decoration can effectively increase
the adsorption energy and detection sensitivity of gas molecules.
Zhang et al. constructed porous phosphorene and found that it could
be used to effectively separate hydrogen from gas mixture.15 By introducing vacancy defects, Mahabal et al.
investigated the sensing characteristics of phosphorene monolayers
toward PH3 and AsH3 gases.16 Yu et al. decorated phosphorene with 25% lithium and achieved
a hydrogen storage capacity of 4.4 wt %.17 Lalitha et al. investigated the adsorption of various gas molecules
(CH4, CO2, H2, and NH3) on calcium-decorated and doped phosphorene.18 Using monolayer or few-layer black phosphorus, a variety
of chemical sensors was studied experimentally, which exhibited extremely
high sensitivity, especially for gases like NO2, NH3, methanol vapor, and so on.19−21 The reported sensitivity
for NO2 detection was down to 5 ppb,20 and for methanol detection the value was 20 ppb.21

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless,
and tasteless gas,
which is toxic to hemoglobic animals (including humans). In the atmosphere,
CO is present in small amounts, chiefly as a product of volcanic activity.
In a closed environment, CO can easily rise to lethal levels, owing
to malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, water
heaters, coal gas, and kerosene room heaters. Aside from the toxicity,
as an important fuel, CO is widely used in the daily life of humans.
Hence, the detection, elimination, and safe storage of CO using 2D
materials are of great importance.

In this work, the density
functional theory (DFT) was adopted to
investigate CO adsorption on various metal-decorated phosphorenes.
All metals are considered to decorate phosphorene, and the binding
energies (Eb) and cohesive energies (Ec) of each metal adatom were calculated. By
comparing Eb with Ec, 10 metals can stably decorate phosphorene, and they were
used to improve the CO adsorption characteristics. The effects of
metal adatoms on phosphorene and the interaction mechanism between
metals and CO molecules are analyzed in detail. Several metals have
been proposed as potential candidates to decorate phosphorene for
the application of CO elimination and storage.

Results and Discussion
CO Adsorption
on Pristine Phosphorene
The optimized
phosphorene geometry structure is shown in Figure 1a, and the red dashed rectangle represents
a unit cell. The calculated lattice constants are 3.31 and 4.57 Å
along y and x directions, respectively,
which are in good agreement with those of a previous study.4 The band structure is presented in Figure 1c, which is calculated along
the path S → Y → Γ → X, as shown in Figure 1b. Both the valence
band maximum and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at
Γ. Hence, a direct band gap of 0.88 eV is obtained, which agrees
well with that reported in ref (26). The slope along the armchair direction is much larger
than that along the zigzag one, and this anisotropic electronic property
is in agreement with that in previous reports.27,28

(c). The gray and blue balls stand for the P atoms in top and bottom
sub-layers, and upper and lower panels of (a) are side and top views,
respectively.

On the basis of the optimized
3 × 4 supercell, the adsorption
of CO molecules on phosphorene was calculated. Various C–O/O–C
direction and adsorption sites are considered, and the most stable
configuration is shown in Figure 2a.29 In this configuration,
the CO molecule is parallel to the phosphorene layer and located at
the hollow site of the honeycomb structure with a vertical distance
of 3.21 Å from the phosphorene plane. The CO molecule has three
nearest P atoms, with an average distance of 3.86 Å between the
C and P atoms. The C–O bond length remains the same as that
of free CO (1.144 Å), which means that the interaction between
CO and phosphorene is quite weak. The band structure of CO-bP presented
in Figure 2b shows
no obvious difference from that of pristine phosphorene, and the direct
band gap of 0.88 eV is still retained. The adsorption energy, Ea, for CO is only 0.12 eV due to the van der
Waals (vdW) interaction, which is smaller than the value required
to form stable adsorption systems under room temperature.30

Metal Decoration and CO Adsorption
The adsorption of
CO on pristine phosphorene is very weak. To adsorb CO strongly, we
tried to use metal decoration. Here, all metals (except for radioactive
metals) are considered as adatoms. It should be noted that metal La
is treated as a representative of all lanthanide metals, considering
that lanthanide metals share the same physical and chemical properties.
For each metal, three decoration sites are considered, that is, hollow
(H), bridge (B), and top (T), and the energy-preferable site is shown
in Table 1. The binding
energies (Eb) and cohesive energies (Ec), calculated by eqs 2 and 3, respectively,
are listed in Table 1. The binding energies for transition metals (TMs) agree with the
values reported in ref (31), and slight differences may be attributed to vdW corrections in
our calculation. Furthermore, the experimental Ec is also given inside the parentheses in Table 1 for comparison.32 The calculated Ec is also in good agreement with the experimental values for most
metals.

Enhancing gas adsorption on 2D materials
using metal decoration
always suffers from the problem of metal clustering due to the small
binding energy. Hence, energy criterion Eb > Ec is employed to ensure the stability
of metal-decorated phosphorene (M-bP). Among the 49 considered metal
atoms, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pd, and La satisfied this criterion,
and they were adopted to decorate phosphorene for the efficient adsorption
of CO. These 10 metals are classified as alkali metals (AMs), alkaline-earth
metals (AEMs), and TM for the convenience of discussion.

For
all of the 10 metal-decorated cases mentioned above, the CO
molecule was placed on the metal atom of M-bP. Unlike nonpolar H2, CO is a polar molecule, and the CO orientations must be
considered. Perpendicular CO orientations are more stable than parallel
ones according to the comparison of their adsorption energies; thus,
two perpendicular CO orientations were given: C atom closer to metal
(case 1, as shown in Figure 3a) and O closer to metal (case 2, as shown in Figure 3b). For perpendicular directions,
the calculated adsorption energies of case 1 are all larger than those
of case 2, meaning that the adsorption of CO with C atom closer to
metal is more stable. Thus, we only consider case 1 in the following
discussion.

CO Adsorption on AM- and AEM-Phosphorene
Previous works
have reported that metal adatoms binding on phosphorene could have
a significant influence on the electronic properties of phosphorene.33,34 Hence, the influences of metals on electronic properties of phosphorene
are also analyzed briefly. Figure 4 presents the energy band structures of five AM-bP
and three AEM-bP systems, and they have similar band structures. The
s electron states in outmost shells of all of the AMs and AEMs are
above the CBM of pristine phosphorene (see Figure 6), which leads to significant electron transfer
from metals to phosphorene. Thus, the Fermi levels shift up in energy
obviously compared to that of pristine phosphorene, which was also
observed in other metal-decorated 2D material systems.33,34 For AMs, there is one s electron in outmost shells, whereas there
are two s electrons for AEMs. Thus, the shifting quantities of Fermi
levels for AEM cases are larger than that for AM cases, resulting
in that the Fermi levels of AEM-bP systems stay above the lowest conduction
band of pristine phosphorene. On the contrary, the AEMs strongly couple
with the lowest conduction band of pristine phosphorene. As a result,
the lowest conduction bands are pushed down and thus there are larger
energy spacings between the lowest and second lowest conduction bands.

(c) K-bP, (d) Rb-bP, (e) Cs-bP, (f) Ca-bP, (g) Sr-bP, and (h) Ba-bP.

On the basis of AM- and AEM-decorated
phosphorene, Table 2 lists the adsorption energies
and transferred charge quantities of CO molecules adsorbed on AM-
and AEM-bP according to eq 4 and Bader charge analysis. After AM and AEM decoration, all Ea show an improvement, especially for Li, Na,
and AEMs. Q denotes the transferred charge quantities
from metal atoms to CO molecules. Bader charge analysis shows that
CO molecules carry negative charges and metal atoms carry positive
charges. Besides the vdW interaction, the attractive Coulomb interactions
between negatively charged CO molecules and positively charged metal
atoms contribute to adsorption energies of CO molecules. Thus, compared
to pristine phosphorene, metal-decorated phosphorenes exhibit larger
adsorption energies for CO molecules. On the contrary, more electron
transfer implies larger interaction and thus larger adsorption energies.
The geometrical information for one CO molecule adsorbed on AM- and
AEM-bP (CO–AM-bP and CO–AEM-bP) systems is given in
the Supporting Information. After CO adsorption,
the bond lengths between metal atoms and the three nearest P atoms
are shorter than those before CO adsorption due to the Coulomb attractive
interaction of CO molecules with metal atoms. The CO bond lengths
of AM cases are the same as that of the free case, whereas those of
AEM cases become longer. The distances between the metal atoms and
CO molecules are also related with the adsorption energies, and the
shorter distances in the same group indicate the larger adsorption
energies. To ensure stable gas molecule adsorption on 2D systems under
room temperature, it is proposed that the adsorption energy of gas
molecules be larger than 0.20 eV.34 Here,
metal Rb and Cs are not eligible candidates due to their relatively
smaller adsorption energies.

Figure 5 presents
the band structures of CO–AM-bP and CO–AEM-bP systems.
As shown in Figure 5b–e, the flat bands appear above the Fermi level for the AMs
except for Li. The flat bands mainly come from CO molecules, as shown
in the large CO density of state (DOS) peaks above Fermi levels in Figure 6b–e. For Li, the band structure is similar to that
before CO adsorption. After CO adsorption, the energy spacings between
the band above and that under Fermi level decreases for AEM-bP systems.
This may be attributed to the interactions between CO molecules and
conduction bands of AEM-bP systems, which push down the conduction
bands of AEM-bP systems.

(e) CO–Cs-bP, (f) CO–Ca-bP, (g) CO–Sr-bP, and
(h) CO–Ba-bP.

To have a better understanding of the interaction between
CO molecules
and metals, we further calculated the local density of states (LDOS’s)
for all of the CO–AM-bP and CO–AEM-bP systems, as shown
in Figure 6. Considering
that the DOS values of metals are rather small, the DOS of metals
were amplified by 10 times in Figure 6 for comparison. In all of the systems, LDOS of C atom
and O atom are of four narrow peaks, and each C DOS peak couples with
an O DOS peak, leading to the strong C–O bonding in CO molecules.
The four pairs of C–O peaks from left to right are named M1–M4
for the convenience of following discussion, as denoted in Figure 6.

For alkali
metals, except for the wide LDOS distribution of Cs
from −11 to −9 eV, all of the LDOS of metals concentrate
at several narrow peaks. In the Li-, Na-, and K-decorated systems,
metal DOS shows two peaks, both of which hybridize with M3 and M4
peaks of CO. In the Rb- and Cs-decorated systems, except for the two
peaks hybriding with M3 and M4, another peak around −11.5 eV
also hybridizes with M1 of CO. Among the hybrid states, M4 is located
just above the Fermi level, which is responsible for the flat band
in Figure 5b–e.
The strong DOS hybridation implies the strong interactions between
CO molecules and alkali atoms and thus the large CO adsorption energies
for AM-bP systems. For alkaline-earth metals, the CO LDOS peaks at
M1–M3 hybridize intensively with metal LDOS peaks, which accounts
for the more larger adsorption energies of CO molecules. On the contrary,
different from AM-decorated systems, LDOS of AEM atoms distribute
widely in the conduction band except for several peaks in the valence
band. This leads to the strong interactions between alkaline-earth
metals and conduction bands of phosphorene, which thus pushes down
the lowest conduction bands. As a consequence, larger energy spacings
between the lowest and second lowest conduction bands are obtained,
as shown in Figure 4f–h.

CO Adsorption on TM-Phosphorene
Figure 7 shows the
band structures of Pd- and La-decorated
phosphorene systems. Different from other metal-atom-decorated systems,
the Fermi level of Pd-bP shows no shift compared to that of pristine
phosphorene and retains a direct band gap of 0.87 eV (0.88 eV for
pristine phosphorene). Similar to that of AEM-bP, the Fermi level
of La-bP shifts up into the conduction band due to electron transfer;
thus, La-bP shows metal characteristic.

Figure 7 Band structures of transition-metal-decorated
phosphorene: (a)
Pd-bP and (b) La-bP.

On the basis of transition metal-decorated phosphorene systems
(TM-bP), we calculated the adsorption energy of CO molecules. The
adsorption energies of CO on Pd-bP and La-bP are 1.37 and 0.88 eV,
respectively, which are much larger than that in other systems and
may only be suitable for use as CO elimination. The large adsorption
energies may be attributed to the large overlaps of electron cloud
between CO molecules and metal atoms. Furthermore, the transferred
electrons reach up to 0.34 e for the transition metal case, which
are larger than those in other systems. This signifies that the interactions
between CO molecules and TM atoms are quite strong. Figure 8 presents the band structures
of TM-bP after CO adsorption, and there is no obvious difference from
that before CO adsorption, except that the band gap increases up to
0.93 eV for CO–Pd-bP.

Figure 8 Band structures of one CO molecule adsorbed
TM-bP systems: (a)
CO–Pd-bP and (b) CO–La-bP.

To analyze the interaction mechanism between CO molecules
and TM
atoms, the LDOS of the two systems are calculated and shown in Figure 9. Different from
other metals, LDOS of Pd has no distribution above or around the Fermi
level, leading to the same band structure as pristine phosphorene;
see Figure 7a. However,
LDOS of La distributes above the Fermi level. The interaction between
states above the Fermi level of La metal and phosphorene pushes down
the conduction band of phosphorene. On the contrary, the electrons
transfer from La to phosphorene, leading to a rise of Fermi level;
see Figure 7b. The
LDOS of C and O atoms still appear as several pairs of coupling peaks.
For CO–Pd-bP system, there are only three pairs of CO peaks,
namely, M1–M3 peaks, but no M4 peak, unlike other systems.
All three CO peaks hybridize with Pd LDOS peaks strongly, which leads
to the large adsorption energy of CO on Pd-bP. For CO–La-bP
system, there are four CO peaks, but the M4 peak in the conduction
band is very weak. Among the four CO peaks, M3 and M4 hybridize with
La LDOS peaks; thus, Ea of CO on La-bP
is smaller than that on Pd-bP.

Adsorption Capacity, Elimination, and Storage
Ten metals
that can be stably bound were considered to effectively decorate phosphorene
and adsorb CO molecules. Decoration of most metals can increase the
adsorption energy of CO significantly. Among the 10 metal elements,
except Rb and Cs, all of the other metal atoms are shown to adsorb
CO molecules stably under room temperature. Hence, the eight kinds
of metal-decorated phosphorenes are considered to explore the adsorption
capacity of CO. CO molecules are added one by one to phosphorene until
no more CO molecules can be adsorbed stably. The adsorption of the
(n + 1)th CO molecule is based on the optimized structure
of nCO molecule adsorbed system (nCO–M-bP). Following this principle, the calculated results
are listed in Table 3. Although Pd shows sufficient Ea for
the first CO molecule adsorption, Ea for
the second CO molecule is only 0.10 eV, which means Pd-bP can adsorb
only 1CO molecule stably. However, other M-bP systems can adsorb multiple
CO molecules on each metal atom, especially for Ca, Sr, Ba, and La.
Gravimetric density (GD) for each M-bP system is calculated by eq 5 to measure the adsorption
capacity (GD1 in Table 3). Except Rb, Cs, and Pd, all of the other metal-decorated phosphorenes
possess an adsorption capacity of 5–10 wt % for CO molecules.
It should be noted that the substrates used here are decorated with
only one metal atom in each 3 × 4 phosphorene, which means that
the metal coverage density is only 6.25%. In practical application,
substrates could be decorated by metals with denser coverage to obtain
larger adsorption capacity. According to ref (17), the coverage density
of lithium on phosphorene can reach 25%. If the other metals reach
the same coverage density, the adsorption capacity of CO could be
much larger (GD2 in Table 3). Hence, these metal-decorated substrates can be used for
efficient elimination of toxic CO gas.

systems, Ead-ave of CO molecules
are in the range of 0.20–0.60 eV, which signifies that the
adsorbed CO gas can be released easily according to ref (29). Hence, these metal-decorated
systems are also suitable for reversible CO storage.

Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated
the adsorption
of toxic gas CO on various metal-decorated phosphorenes. The adsorption
energy of CO on pristine phosphorene is too low to achieve a stable
adsorption under room temperature. To improve the adsorption of CO,
various metals were considered to decorate phosphorenes. Only Li,
Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pd, and La satisfy the criteria for stable
binding. Adsorption ability shows significant enhancement after metal
decoration, which is attributed to the strong coupling between CO
and metals. Except Rb and Cs, all of the other metals show sufficient
adsorption energy to adsorb CO. For Li-, Na-, K-, Ca-, Sr-, Ba-, and
La-decorated systems, 3–6CO molecules can be adsorbed effectively
on each metal atom. If denser metal decoration is considered, adsorption
capacity can reach 34.75–46.04%; thus, these seven metals are
good phosphorene decoration candidates for the application of CO elimination.
Among them, the average adsorption energies of CO on Li-, Na-, K-,
Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-decorated systems range from 0.20 to 0.60 eV, which
means that these systems can also be used as reversible CO storage.

Computational
Methods
Our DFT calculation was carried out by using the
Vienna ab initio
simulation package code.22,23 The generalized gradient
approximation with the parameterization of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
was adopted.24 The van der Waals (vdW)
interaction was corrected by using the empirical correction scheme
of Grimme (DFT + D2).25 To avoid interaction
between the periodically repeated adsorbates, the relatively large
3 × 4 supercells are adopted, as shown in Figure 1a. In all calculations, the kinetic energy
cutoff was set to be 500 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 3
× 3 × 1 by the Monkhorst–Pack k-point
scheme. All of the structures were relaxed until the forces on each
atom were less than 0.01 eV/Å. A vacuum of 15 Å was used
along the z axis (perpendicular to the black phosphorous
layer) to avoid the interaction between the periodically repeated
structures.

For CO adsorption on phosphorene, the adsorption
energy (Ea) is calculated by 1  where EbP, ECO, and ECO-bP are energies of phosphorene,
CO molecule, and CO adsorbed phosphorene,
respectively. For metal atoms binding on phosphorene, the binding
energies (Eb, distinguished from the adsorption
energy for CO molecule) are calculated by 2  where EM and EM-bP are energies of metal atom and metal-decorated
phosphorene, respectively. For comparison, the cohesive energies (Ec) of metals were also calculated by 3  where Eunit is
the total energy of a unit cell for bulk metal and n is atom number in the unit cell. For CO adsorption on metal-decorated
phosphorene, Ea is calculated by 4  where ECO–M-bP is the total energy of the adsorption
system. As used in hydrogen
storage, gravimetric density (GD) is also employed to measure the
storage capacity of CO, which is calculated by 5  where mCO, mM, and mphosphorene are mass of adsorbed CO molecules,
metal atoms, and phosphorene,
respectively.
