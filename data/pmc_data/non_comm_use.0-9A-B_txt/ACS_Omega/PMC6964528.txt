Starting from methylmaleic anhydride, a facile total
synthesis of pandalizine A alkaloid is described via the regioselective
reduction of methylmaleimide and acid-catalyzed enolization of 4-(3-methyl-2-oxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)butanal followed by chemoselective intramolecular
dehydrative cyclization as the key steps. It is noteworthy that the
analogous model system with an additional β-methyl group followed
an alternative chemoselective intermolecular aldol condensation pathway.

Introduction
Alkaloids are important
compounds that possess a broad range of effective biological activities,
and some novel azabicyclic alkaloids are shown in Figure 1.1−5 Tropical Pandanus amaryllifolius shrub
from Southeast Asia is used in folk medicine for the treatment of
gout, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and rheumatism.6,7 Recently,
the azabicyclic alkaloids pandalizines A (5.2 mg), B (4.5 mg), C (1.2
mg), D (1.3 mg), and E (1.2 mg) have been isolated from 6.0 kg of
aerial parts of P. amaryllifolius species,
and their structural and stereochemical assignments have been done
on the basis of NMR, 2D NMR, and circular dichroism studies (Figure 2).6,7 The
authors have also proposed that glutamic acid and leucine are biogenetic
precursors of all of these alkaloids. A large number of well-established
synthetic protocols to design azabicyclic frameworks are known in
the contemporary literature.8 In this context,
very recently, elegant total syntheses of pandalizine A, (±)-pandalizines
B, and (±)-pandalizines C have been accomplished via photo-oxidation
of specifically synthesized furylalkylamine by Vassilikogiannakis
and co-workers from Greece (Scheme 1).9,10 However, synthesis of pandalizines
D and E bearing an additional hydroxyl group at two different positions
in ring-B is still awaited. To date, we have accomplished the total
synthesis of a large number of bioactive natural products using cyclic
anhydrides and their derivatives as the potential precursors.11−15 Now we report the total synthesis of pandalizine
A via the regioselective reduction of citraconimide followed by a
substrate-specific chemoselective ring closure as crucial reactions
(Schemes 2 and 3).

of Pandalizines A
Results and Discussion
A systematic plan was prepared
to synthesize pandalizine A from methylmaleic anhydride and the accordingly
proposed concise retrosynthetic analysis is depicted in Scheme 2. The regioselective reduction
of citraconimide and chemoselective intramolecular cyclization of
a well-structured substrate over possible intermolecular aldol condensation
were the foreseen challenges in our synthetic strategy. The reaction
of methylmaleic anhydride (1a) with 4-aminobutanol in
a refluxing mixture of acetic acid plus toluene directly furnished
the corresponding imide 2a in 92% yield via the dehydrative
cyclization of the formed intermediate regioisomeric maleamic acids
and the thermal acylation of free primary alcohol (Scheme 3). The reaction of imide 2a with a bulky reducing agent such as DIBAL-H at −78
°C directly provided a column chromatographically inseparable
regioisomeric mixture of desired deacylated major lactamol 3a and the corresponding undesired minor isomer in a ∼9:1 ratio
(by 1H NMR) with 88% yield. The structural assignment of
lactamol 3a was initially done on the basis of more deshielded 1H NMR signal for β-vinylic proton at δ = 6.55,
which was finally confirmed on completion of the total synthesis of
pandalizine A. Further reduction of the above-mentioned mixture of
lactamols using BF3OEt2–Et3SiH via a plausible formation of the corresponding iminium ion intermediates
and purification of the crude product by silica gel column chromatography
yielded pure lactam 4a in 82% yield. The PCC oxidation
of the primary alcohol unit in lactam 4a delivered the
essential lactam aldehyde 5a in 76% yield for further
systematic intramolecular condensation studies. In our hands, the
reactions of compound 5a with bases such as DBU, NaH,
LiHMDS, and NaHMDS resulted in a complex reaction mixture.16 The lactam aldehyde 5a on treatment
with p-TSA in toluene at room temperature remained
completely unreacted. However, the same reaction at 60 °C chemoselectively
resulted in our target compound pandalizine A (7a) in
63% yield via the formation of the corresponding enol intermediate 6a and the intramolecular dehydrative condensation. In the
present reaction, the formation of the significant enol intermediate 6a initiated prior to the possible enolization of aldehyde
moiety and feasible intermolecular aldol condensation. All our attempts
to further improve the efficiency of the above-specified reaction
by changing the reaction time and temperature were unsuccessful. The
obtained NMR data for an analytically pure sample of pandalizine A
(7a) was completely matching with reported data.6,9,10 The total synthesis of pandalizine
A (7a) was completed in five steps with 29% overall yield.
The obtained natural product was highly prone to oxidative degradation
under normal atmospheric conditions and got transformed into a complex
mixture in 48 h.

To demonstrate yet another example of such
type of chemoselective cyclization, maleimide 2b was
synthesized in 93% yield by dehydrative condensation of dimethylmaleic
anhydride (1b) with 4-aminobutanol in refluxing toluene17 (Scheme 3). Symmetrical imide 2b on NaBH4 reduction
formed lactamol 3b, and its treatment with BF3OEt2–Et3SiH provided lactam 4b in 68% overall yield over two steps. The PCC oxidation of alcohol 4b yielded the desired substrate 5b in 71% yield.
Surprisingly, the reaction of lactam aldehyde 5b with p-TSA in toluene at room temperature followed another pathway
and underwent the chemoselective intermolecular dehydrative aldol
condensation furnishing the undesired product 7b in 64%
yield via the preferential formation of an alternate enol intermediate 6b. The repetition of the above-specified reaction at 60 °C
also exclusively resulted in the same product 7b, but
with 55% yield. Overall, the lactam aldehydes 5a and 5b follow two different reaction pathways under a similar
set of reaction conditions due to the difference in acidity of methylene
proton in lactam moieties and relatively less steric hindrance noted
by a conjugate base in the formation of the intermediate 6a.

Conclusions
In summary, from readily available starting
materials, we have completed protection-free practical total synthesis
of pandalizine A via a remarkable regioselective reduction and chemoselective
intramolecular cyclization pathway. Present studies represent a unique
example wherein actual natural product precursor indeed followed expected
chemoselective intramolecular cyclization route and furnished the
target compound, while the analogous substrate with an additional
β-methyl group delivered the undesired aldol product. We feel
that the favored formation of an appropriately reactive cyclic enol
intermediate for intramolecular cyclization is the genesis of delicately
balanced chemoselectivity. Overall, the absence/presence of β-methyl
group governs the course of competitive carbon–carbon bond-forming
reactions and functions as a chemoselectivity switch.
