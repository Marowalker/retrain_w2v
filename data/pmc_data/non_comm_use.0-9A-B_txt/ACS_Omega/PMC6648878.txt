Hierarchical
structures in shell with transition metal underneath
is a promising design for high-performance and low-cost heterogeneous
nanocatalysts (NCs). Such a design enables the optimum extent of synergetic
effects in NC surface. It facilitates intermediate reaction steps
and, therefore, boosts activity of NC in oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR). In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported ternary metallic
NC comprising Cucluster-in-Pdcluster nanocrystal
and surface decoration of atomic Pt clusters (14 wt %) is synthesized
by using the wet chemical reduction method with sequence and reaction
time controls. By annealing in H2 environment (H2/N2 = 9:1, 10 sccm) at 600 K for 2 h, specific activity
of Cu@Pd/Pt is substantially improved by ∼2.0-fold as compared
to that of the pristine sample and commercial Pt catalysts. By cross-referencing
results of electron microscopic, X-ray spectroscopic, and electrochemical
analyses, we demonstrated that reduction annealing turns ternary NC
into complex of Cu3Pt alloy and CuxPd1–x alloy. Such a transition
preserves Pt and Pd in metallic phases, therefore improving the activity
by ∼29% and the stability of NC in an accelerated degradation
test (ADT) as compared to those of pristine Cu@Pd/Pt in 36 000
cycles at 0.85 V (vs RHE). This study presents robust H2 annealing for structure stabilization of NC and systematic characterizations
for rationalization of the corresponding mechanisms. These results
provide promising scenarios for facilitation of heterogeneous NC in
ORR applications.

1 Introduction
A burgeoning
global energy crisis by the depletion of fossil fuels
stimulates researchers to find effective, low-cost, and environmentally
benign energy devices. Among energy conversion assessments, high efficiency,
scalability of power densities, and ease of module assembly make fuel
cells one of the most promising technologies to address the aforementioned
problems.1−7 These advantages make fuel cells attractive in terms of green and
high-performance sectors; however, the wide-scale commercialization
of fuel cells is stagnated by the lack of efficient and cost-effective
cathodic nanocatalysts (NCs). Cathodic NCs are used to trigger the
sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which incurs the highest
energy barrier (∼0.3–0.4 V) among components in a fuel
cell module.8−10 To achieve considerable efficiency, omnipotent cathodic
NCs are made by high contents of noble metals (mostly Pt) with low
overpotential toward ORR, leading to the highest capital cost among
assembled components in a state-of-the-art fuel cell module.11,12 Apart from material cost, chemical reactivity and structural reliability
are long-standing kinetics bottlenecks that come into play, dragging
down the performances of Pt-based NCs in ORR. As a consequence, developing
a new class of catalysts consisting of lower dosage of Pt or even
alternative metals with high structural reliability and ORR activity
is of paramount importance to making fuel cells in practice.

The aforementioned issues can be addressed by modifying the surface
structure of NCs or changing the heteroatomic intermixing.13 Intensive efforts have been devoted to address
such indexes and to the development of less expensive and more abundant
materials in the form of intraparticle configurations (alloy,14−16 nanowires,17 onion,18 core–shell,19−22 etc.). However, efficiency and stability of current
cathodic NCs remain far from the commercial standards. Among existing
geometric configurations, core–shell structured heterogeneous
NCs possess the strongest structural stabilization and chemical activity
in electrochemical reactions.23−25 These properties are enhanced
by strain and electronegativity differences at the core–shell
interface. More specifically, to optimize the interface effects and
noble-metal utilization, a surface active Pt-shell with a core low
electronegativity transition metal underneath is commonly designed
in a core–shell-type NC. In such configurations, core crystal
serves as a source, which injects electrons (or forms a negative potential
field toward) to the shell crystal and thus improves the reduction
activity of NCs in a redox system. Transition-metal additives (e.g.,
Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Ru, and Sn) with high oxygen affinity are commonly
employed as the core crystal. These elements provide low-energy pathways
for allocation and recombination of radicals (i.e., O*, OH*, and H*)
in H2O, which reduced the standing time of reactants on
NC surfaces. Meanwhile, in a heterogeneous NC, redox kinetics is dominated
by both geometric (lattice strain) and electronic (ligand effect)
configurations along with ensemble effect. Ensemble effect arises
when dissimilar surface atoms together
turn on the bifunctional mechanism (selectivity and variety of sorption
sites). Owing to differences of atomic arrangement between surface
active atoms (Pt) and the transition-metal core crystal underneath,
lattice strain arises on the heterogeneous binary interface. It can
turn compressive or expansive in the surface layer,
therefore either localizing or delocalizing electrons at the heterogeneous
core–shell interface to enhance electronic properties at the
surface. Ligand effects are caused by the atomic vicinity of two dissimilar
surface metal atoms that induces electronic charge transfer between
them and thus affects their electronic band structure (i.e., charge
relocation to the shell region via heteroatomic electronegativity
difference). Along with scientific advantages toward ORR activity
due to these
configurations, heterogeneous NCs are also highly sensitive to material
degradation modes of cathodic NCs (Scheme S1).

Core–shell structured NCs with proper heterojunction
components
and minimized shell crystal thickness seem to be a perfect design
for conducting ORR in fuel cells. However, noble-metal usage is limited
by formation of monolayer shell thickness in such configurations.
To further improve metal utilization and enhance electron relocation
potential at the heterogeneous binary interface with a lower amount
of Pt usage, surface decoration of strong electronegative and active
sub-nanometer Pt clusters in cluster-in-cluster structured NCs is
a possible strategy.26 Recently, researchers
also developed an effective strategy to control the depth of decorating
clusters.27 Those Pt clusters extract electrons
from the heterogeneous binary interface of inner clusters by strong
electronegative force and local lattice during redox reaction. As
a result, ORR activity of NC is substantially enhanced by a couple
of orders as compared to those in common structures (i.e., alloy,
cluster-in-cluster, core–shell, etc.).

Our previous works
have developed easy assessments on design and
synthesis of ternary NCs comprising Cu core and Pd shell decorated
with highly active sub-nanometer Pt clusters on the surface by controlling
growth sequences of metal crystals. With such a unique structure,
redox activity and stability of NC are improved by 2–3 orders
as compared to commercial Pt catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate
that specific activity (SA) of such type of NCs in alkaline-based
ORR can be improved by more than 2-fold by phase transition of Cu@Pd–Pt
NC into complexes of Cu3Pt and Pd1–xCux alloys via reduction
annealing in the hydrogen environment (H2/N2 = 9/1, at 600 K for 2 h). Compared with pristine Cu@Pd–Pt
and commercial J.M.-Pt/C NCs, specific activities (SAs) of postannealed
Cu@Pd/Pt-H are 2.02- and 2.05-fold higher, respectively. Of special
relevance is the fact that the mass activity (MA) of Cu@Pd/Pt-H is
improved by 29% after 36 000 ADT cycles, whereas that of commercial
J.M.-Pt/C is decreased by ∼32% after 31 000 ADT cycles.
These results reveal the strong stability and activity of postannealed
Cu@Pd/Pt-H and shed light on the development of high-performance and
cost-effective cathodic NCs in alkaline fuel cells (AFCs).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface Morphology and
Crystal Structure
The morphologies (including particle shape,
crystal structure,
and surface configuration) of experimental NCs were characterized
using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 1 compares typical
HRTEM images of pristine (Cu@Pd/Pt) and postannealed NCs (Cu@Pd/Pt-H).
The corresponding inverse Fourier transformed (IFT) images (lower
right corners) and line histogram of selected fringes are compared
in insets. Variation in shape of postannealed NC as compared to pristine
NC can be rationalized by phase segregation and atomic restructuring
between NCs in reduction annealing. Such a phenomenon is triggered
by reducing the surface Gibb’s
free energy due to a thermal-induced atomic restructuring at the interparticle
boundary and intraparticle interfaces of NCs. As shown in Figure 1a, the nanoparticles
are grown into multifaceted spherical crystallites with twin boundaries
(both sides of red arrow in IFT pattern) in Cu@Pd/Pt. In this case,
the lattice space at twin facets is 2.13 Å. This value is decreased
by 6.1% as compared to that of the ideal Pt(111) facet (2.26 Å),
indicating the formation of a semicoherent core–shell interface
with a strong compressive strain in the Pd shell region. Such a strong
lattice strain is further probed directly by X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) analysis in a later section. A high defect density (denoted
by green arrow) is formed due to the rapid crystal growth of Cu core
and surface deposition of Pd atoms by interaction with a strong reducing
agent.

Figure 1 HRTEM images of (a) pristine “Cu@Pd/Pt” and (b) postannealed
“Cu@Pd/Pt-H” NCs. d-Spacing values
of experimental NCs are calculated by using inverse Fourier transformed
(IFT) images and their corresponding line histograms (insets). Fourier
transformation patterns of selected areas in HRTEM images are shown
in lower left corners. Low-magnification images of (c) pristine and
(d) postannealed NCs are shown in the lower section.

Compared to Cu@Pd/Pt, Cu@Pd/Pt-H (Figure 1b) possesses less truncations
and roughness
in surface with larger particle size (Figure 1d) due to the formation of Cu3Pt and Cu1–xPdx alloys. Such features are mainly attributed to restructuring
among Pt, Pd, and Cu atoms between NCs. Such a hypothesis is confirmed
by results of XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses.
As compared to that of Cu@Pd/Pt, the lattice space is further compressed
by 1.9% (d(111) = 2.09 Å). Significant
distorted lattice fringes (denoted by yellow arrow) with domain size
ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 nm reveal the lattice disordering of Cu3Pt by adjacent Cu1–xPdx alloys and show a typical feature of the strong
lattice strain at the heterogeneous interface (i.e., Cu@Pd binary
interface). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (lower left corners)
prove the atomic structure of experimental NCs. It is a qualitative
interpretation of periodicity of the selected region in an image.
In an HRTEM image, symmetry and profile of an FFT pattern refer to
ordering of atomic arrangement. As shown in Figure 1a, nonsymmetrical twin bright spots with
intensity difference indicate the presence of multiple twin boundaries,
which confirms suppression of long-range ordering. Meanwhile, in the
case of Cu@Pd/Pt-H, the presence of ring pattern is attributed to
formation of polydispersed and locally disordered structure as compared
to that of pristine NC. Low-magnification image in Figure 1c and histogram show that Cu@Pd/Pt
is grown in a broad size distribution ranging from 2 to 6 nm with
an average particle size of 3.8 nm, whereas in the case of Cu@Pd/Pt-H,
particle size distribution range is noted from 7 to 11 nm owing to
particle agglomeration and Cu3Pt/Cu1–xPdx alloy formation.
For comparison, crystal structural analyses of Cu@Pt and Pd@Pt NCs
have been considered.26

Phase segregation,
lattice strain, and average coherent length
(Davg) of experimental NCs are further
revealed by XRD analysis, and the corresponding structural parameters
are summarized in Table 1. Composition for Pd phase in experimental NCs is estimated by using
Vegard’s law, and the qualitative index for the preferential
facet is determined by intensity ratios of H(111)/H(hkl) (H(111) and H(200) refer, respectively, to intensities for diffraction peaks of (111)
and (200) facets). As indicated in Figure 2, peaks X1 and X2 centered
at 17.524 and 20.221° refer to diffraction signals from (111)
and (200) facets of metallic-phase Pt nanocrystals in Pt-CNT (green
line). For XRD pattern of Pd-CNT, the two peaks (gray dashed line)
are slightly shifted to the left (lower angle), suggesting its relatively
larger lattice constant as compared to Pt-CNT. Such a lattice expansion
could be attributed to formation of local disorder and possibly B
dopant in Pd crystal due a rapid crystal growth by a strong reducing
agent of NaBH4. In the meantime, Pd-CNT shows larger Davg, and this can be attributed to its higher
surface free energy, which takes smaller specific surface area for
stabilization as compared to that of Pt-CNT.

(Cu@Pd/Pt) and postannealing (Cu@Pd/Pt-H)
experimental NCs compared with control samples (Pd-CNT and Pt-CNT).
Peaks “X1” and “X2” correspond to diffraction
signals from (111) and (200) facets of NCs (Pt or Pd), whereas peak
X* refers to (111) facet of Cu3Pt alloy. All of the spectra
were measured under the incident X-ray of 18 keV.

a Pd (%) is determined by using Vegard’s
law. Reference crystal structure of Cu is refereed to mp-30 ID in
Materials Project database. For Pd, lattice
constant is estimated by XRD pattern of Pd-CNT.

For the case of Cu@Pd/Pt, a slight
offset of diffraction peaks
to the left indicates a lattice expansion of (111) and (200) facets
as compared to those of Pt-CNT. The extent of Cu intermix is determined
to be 4.5% for (111) and 0% for (200) facets. Considering that the
extent of local disordering in Pd crystal is high (denoted by the
high diffuse
scattering background and high H(111)/H(200) ratio) and because of the uneven peak
offsets, the changes of lattice spaces are assigned to the factors’
local expansion instead of alloy formation. On the other hand, for
Co@Pd/Pt-H, a significant offset in diffraction peaks suggests the
largest extent of Cu intermix (∼65%) in Pd crystal among experimental
NCs. Meanwhile, a weak diffraction peak at 18.851° refers to
a segregation of stoichiometric Cu3Pt alloy and the highest H(111)/H(200) value
(2.74), indicating the strongest preference in (111) facet among experimental
NCs. Those characteristics reveal a dramatic increase in the long-range
ordering structure in Cu@Pd/Pt after H2 annealing. By cross-referencing
HRTEM and XPS (later section) results, such heteroatomic intermix
is attributed to segregation of the Cu to Pd region simultaneously
with incorporation of Pt in the core region. Meanwhile, because of
increased Pd content in the surface, easy intercalation of Pt atoms
in the opened shell region took place and thus higher extent of Pd/Pt/Cu
intermixing takes place. An even closer look reveals that for Cu@Pd/Pt-H
because of Cu3Pt alloy formation, a higher index of lattice
strain has been noted as compared to Cu@Pd/Pt. Meanwhile, significant
increase in Davg after annealing is noted
due to strong agglomeration in the absence of stabilizer (also shown
in Figure 1d) between
NCs. For comparison, details of structural interpretation of Cu@Pt
and Pd@Pt NCs with XRD patterns are given in Figure S2.

XAS analysis was employed to analyze the local atomic
and electronic
structures of Pt atoms. Figure 3 compares the normalized Pt L3 edge X-ray absorption
near-edge spectra (XANES) and Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption
fine spectra (EXAFS) of NCs under inspection. In a L3 edge
spectrum, position of the inflection point (arrow X) refers to threshold
energy (E0) for 2p to 5d electron transition
and is linearly proportional to oxidation state of the target atom
(particularly for transition metals). Intensity (HA) and width (WA) of near-edge
absorption peak (white line) elucidate the relative extent of empty
states and splitting of 5d5/2 orbital with the amount of
surface oxygen chemisorption. Width (WB) and intensity (HB) of oscillation hump
in the postedge region explain the extent of structure ordering around
the target atom. It is evident from Figure S3 that metallic characteristics of Pt-CNT are similar to Pt foil as
is evident from the similar position of inflection point and thus
for postannealed Cu@Pd/Pt-H NC also (Figure 3a). The highest white-line intensity (HA) for Pt-CNT reflects the highest extent of
oxygen adsorption at Pt atoms of Pt-CNT among all samples. On the
other hand, significant suppressed HA for
pristine Cu@Pd/Pt NC as compared to that of Pt-CNT reveals an inhibition
of oxygen adsorption in Pt atoms or Pt oxidation. For Cu@Pd/Pt, the
presence of strong electronegative Pt clusters on the surface reveals
charge relocation to Pt clusters from neighboring atoms due to steric
effects Pt clusters intercalating in the Pd shell. Charge relocation
is
further revealed by the downshift of inflection peak to low-energy
sites (see Figure 3a inset). Pt cluster intercalation results in a local disordered
structure as is revealed by a significant suppressed backscattering
intensity in the postedge region (HB).
As for Cu@Pd/Pt-H, incorporation of Pt atoms in the core followed
by formation of Cu3Pt is consistently explained by reduction
of Pt contents in NC surface and has been proved by XPS analysis in
a later section. Compared to that of Pt-CNT, the comparable HA intensity indicates formation of crystal-phase
Cu3Pt alloy, which consistently explains the results of
XRD and XPS analyses (in a later section). In this event, compared
to Cu@Pd/Pt, offset of inflection point close to that of Pt-CNT (Figure 3a, inset) suggests
the typical feature of metallic Pt in Cu@Pd/Pt-H. This phenomenon
indicates the absence of charge localization between Pt and neighboring
atoms, again proving disassembling of intraparticle cluster-in-cluster
interfaces due to phase segregation and formation of Cu3Pt and Cu1–xPdx alloys in Cu@Pd/Pt-H.

XANES and (b) k3 weighted EXAFS spectra
of Cu@Pd/Pt and Cu@Pd/Pt-H with
Pt-CNT.

Figure 3b compares
Fourier-transformed Pt L3 edge EXAFS spectra (i.e., radial
structure functions, RSFs) of experimental NCs and Pt-CNT. In an RSF
spectrum, position and intensity of radial peak correspond, respectively,
to the distances and number of backscatterers (neighboring atoms)
around targeting atoms. For Pt-CNT, the radial peak (A) across 1.7–3.2
Å accounts for contribution of outgoing X-ray interferences in
the metallic Pt–Pt bond. For the case of Cu@Pd/Pt, as compared
to that of Pt-CNT, the radial peak is split into two peaks, and the
intensity is substantially suppressed by ∼67%. These characteristics
can be attributed to the destructive X-ray interferences of Pt–Pt,
Pt–Pd, and Pd–Cu bond pairs around Pt atoms, which prove
the high content of heteroatomic intermix in Cu@Pd/Pt. By adopting
H2 annealing treatment, as compared to RSF of pristine
Cu@Pd/Pt, the radial peak is shifted to the left and is enhanced by
2.66-fold. These characteristics indicate a substantially reduced
metallic Pt–M bond length, which is consistent with the result
of XRD, proving the formation of Cu3Pt alloy in Cu@Pd/Pt-H.

To figure out the effects of heteroatomic intermix and alloy formation,
quantitative structure parameters of experimental NCs and control
sample (Pt-CNT) are determined by model analysis on Pt L3 edge EXAFS spectra (Figure 3b), and the corresponding results are shown in Table 2. For Pt-CNT, the radial peak
in the RSF results from the X-ray interference with the Pt–Pt
bond pair at peak A (2.752 Å) with a coordination number (CNPt–Pt) of 6.45. Such a small CN is understandable due
to the presence of high-density surface defects in rodlike fine NC
in Pt-CNT in which most Pt atoms are located (Figure S1). Such a characteristic is consistently revealed
by the higher intensity ratio of (111) to (200) peaks and broadened
X-ray diffraction peaks as compared to that of the bulk Pt crystal
(Figure 2). For Cu@Pd/Pt,
the radial peak of the Pt–M bond pair (peak A) is split into
peaks C and D, which comprise contributions from backscattering interferences
of CNPt–Pt (3.92), CNPt–Pd (2.86),
and CNPt–Cu (0.57) with the heteroatomic intermixes
(χ) of 38.9% for Pd and 7.7% for Cu around the Pt atom. With
a total CN of 7.35, a stronger radial peak is expected but has been
significantly suppressed by 67% as compared to that of Pt atom in
Pt-CNT. Such a phenomenon seems controversial; however, it can be
rationalized by destructive interferences between both in-phase (Pt–Pt)
and out-of-phase (i.e., mainly Pt–Pd and partially Pt–Cu)
backscattering X-rays28 and the presence
of high-density local defects at intraparticle interfaces. This scenario
is expected in a ternary nanoparticle synthesized by rapid crystal
growth processes in the presence of a strong reducing agent with sequential
controls on metal ion reduction. In this event, as consistently revealed
by suppressed scattering hump in the postedge region, Pt atoms tend
to form discrete atomic Pt clusters in the shell region or the interface
between Pd and Cu in the NC surface.

a χ stands for extent of heteroatomic
intermix for M atoms around Pt in a bond pair of Pt–M, that
is, χ for Pt–Pd refers to extent of Pd atoms among total
coordination numbers around the Pt atom. For optimization of structure
parameters, sigma square is determined to be 0.004 Å2 by fitting the spectrum of Pt foil and is adopted for fitting all
experimental spectra.

For
the case of Cu@Pd/Pt-H, as compared to radial peak A, the two
radial peaks are merged in one (peak B) and shifted to the left. Those
features refer to the constructive interference of backscattering
X-rays from local coordination neighbors of the Pt atom. As consistently
revealed by the enhanced HB/WB ratio in the postedge region and the presence of peak
X* in the XRD pattern, Pt atoms are transformed from local disordering
atomic clusters (probed by significantly suppressed HB/WB ratio in the postedge
region) to a local ordering structure in a Cu3Pt crystal.
Quantitative structure parameters around the Pt atom further confirm
this scenario (Table 2). Accordingly, CNs are determined to be 1.33 for Pt–Pt, 1.01
for Pt–Pd, and 2.36 for Pt–Cu bond pairs and ending
up with the total CN of Pt atoms being 4.7 in Cu@Pd/Pt-H. This value
is far smaller than that of the atom in the metallic crystal surface
(6–9), which suggests mainly that Pt atoms are located in interfaceted
corners or edges of NC. In this event, as compared to that of Cu@Pd/Pt,
a substantially enhanced radial peak is a consequence of constructive
interferences of backscattering X-rays in the local environment. It
reveals the reduction of interfacial defect density due to the atomic
restructuring followed by segregation of Pd1–xCux and Cu3Pt phases
by thermal energy in Cu@Pd/Pt-H.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis at Pt 4f and Pd
3d orbitals was performed to investigate surface chemical compositions
and binding energies (BEs) of elements in experimental NCs. In this
study, the incident X-ray with 485 eV excitation energy with probing
depth of ∼2.6 nm is used. Figure 4 shows the fitted XPS spectra in the Pt 4f
and Pd 3d regions for the experimental NCs. In a Pt 4f spectrum, doublet
peaks at 71.2 and 74.3 eV, respectively,
emerge the photoelectron emission from Pt 4f7/2 and Pt
4f5/2 orbitals. However, for the Pd 3d spectrum, doublet
peaks around 336 and 341 eV are photoemission lines from Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 orbitals, respectively. The peaks
are further deconvoluted for determination of the signals from different
oxidation states, and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 3. Accordingly, compared
to Pt and Pd emission lines of metallic Pt and Pd, BEs are decreased
to 71.06 eV at Pt 4f7/2 and 335.58 eV at Pd 3d5/2 orbitals in Cu@Pd/Pt. These decrements are attributed to charge
relocation from Pd to Pt and steric shielding effects of Pt atoms
in defect sites that protect Pd from oxidation. Compared to Cu@Pd/Pt,
BEs of Pt 4f7/2 and Pd 3d5/2 are further decreased
to 70.97 and 335.43 eV, respectively. Such a phenomenon can be attributed
to the reduction of defect sites among Pt, Pd, and Cu clusters and
in NC surface followed by phase segregation and formation of Cu3Pt and Pd1–xCux alloys in Cu@Pd/Pt-H during H2 annealing.
Surface compositions of experimental NCs are summarized in Table 4. Accordingly, Cu@Pd/Pt
comprise 53 atom % of Cu, 23 atom % of Pd, and 24 atom % of Pt. After
H2 annealing, the three elements redistribute to 52, 27,
and 21 atom %, respectively, in Cu@Pd/Pt-H. Given that probing depth
of XPS is less than 2 nm, a slight difference for the composition
change is understandable between NCs in the size ranging from 3 to
10 nm. In this event, as compared to that of Cu@Pd/Pt, a slight increase
of 4 atom % depicts the surface segregation of Pd as consistently
revealed by the increasing oxidation of Pd contents by 6 atom % in
Cu@Pd/Pt-H.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was employed for determining the
electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and surface chemical states of
experimental NCs and the control sample (J.M./Pt). The CV curves (Figure 5a) were recorded
in N2-purged 0.1 M KOH solutions at 20 mV/s under room
temperature, and the corresponding electrochemical parameters are
summarized in Table 5. In a CV curve, the three distinctive potential regions are related
to underpotential deposition of hydrogen atoms between 0 < E < 0.38 V, the double-layer region in between, and the
chemisorption of oxygen species (OH) over 0.6 V vs RHE. The position
and width of the current peak are susceptible to chemical composition
and structure in the NC surface. For instance, the current peak at
∼0.8 V (vs RHE) in the forward sweep refers to the redox response
by the formation of α Pt oxide (EOads) and that at ∼0.7 V (vs RHE) in the backward
sweep is the contribution of oxygen desorption from the Pt surface
of J.M./Pt (EOdes). Meanwhile,
the broad peak width refers to the large variety of oxygen adsorption
energies in different reaction sites of the Pt surface. For Cu@Pd/Pt,
as compared to J.M./Pt, EOads is shifted to the right by 0.1 V, indicating the increasing barrier
for surface adsorption of O. With the same metal loading in the electrode,
there
was a substantially increased peak intensity again showing the formation
of highly dispersed Pt clusters (i.e., high electrochemical surface
area). Notice that, compared to that of J.M./Pt, the EOdes in backward sweep is shifted to the right,
suggesting the weaker oxygen adsorption in the Cu@Pd/Pt surface. These
evidences explain its substantial improvement of mass activity (MA)
and onset potential as compared to J.M./Pt.

sweep voltammetry (LSV) spectra of pristine
and postannealing experimental NCs compared with commercial J.M.-Pt/C

a ESCA is calculated by using the
oxygen reduction region. The corresponding parameters are given in
the following section (preparation of the electrode and the method
for ORR activity experiment).

Apparently, compared to Cu@Pd/Pt, intensities of the EOads and EOdes peaks are, respectively, attenuated by ΔH1 and ΔH2 for Cu@Pd/Pt-H.
Both the characteristics consistently revealed the reduction of ECSA
as a result of the agglomeration between NCs. Meanwhile, position
of the EOdes peak of Cu@Pd/Pt-H
is shifted to the left, which depicts the higher energy barrier of
oxygen desorption as compared to that of Cu@Pd/Pt. Those characteristics
can be rationalized by restructuring of highly active surface Pt clusters
into Cu3Pt accompanied by the formation of Pd1–xCux alloys. In these
two phases, the presence of Cu CN increases oxygen adsorption energy.
It suppresses ORR activities of Pt and Pd domains; as a result, Eonset of NC is reduced. In the same mechanism,
reducing of local defects by alloy formation improves stability of
Cu@Pd/Pt-H and will be discussed by results of the accelerated degradation
test (ADT) later (Figure 6).

NCs in ORR for the initial state (#0 cycle) and the final state. (c)
CV and (d) LSV curves of Cu@Pd/Pt-H NC for the selected ADT cycles.
(e) Normalized initial and final current densities for experimental
NCs compared with J.M.-Pt/C after different ADT cycles.

The ORR measurements were carried out in O2-saturated
0.1 M KOH solutions with rotation rates of working electrode at 400–3600
rpm. Examples of LSV curves at 1600 rpm are given in Figure 5b. The oxygen reduction is
under a mixed kinetic and diffusion control from 0.95 to 0.80 V (vs
RHE), followed by a mainly diffusion-controlled region. Through extrapolation,
onset potential (Eonset) of experimental
NCs follows the order Cu@Pd/Pt-H (0.898 V) < Cu@Pd/Pt (0.909 V)
< J.M.-Pt/C (0.915 V). In an LSV curve, Eonset refers to threshold voltage for initiating ORR and is
affected by trade-offs among the extent of surface oxidation (steric
shielding effect), heteroatomic intermix (bifunctional mechanism),
and configurational identity of heterogeneous clusters in NC. This
explains that higher Eonset refers to
the lower energy barrier for redox cycles in fuel cells.

The
long-term durability of experimental NCs was tested using the
accelerated degradation test (ADT) with repetitive potential CV cycles.
The comparative CV and LSV curves of pristine and postannealing NCs
for initial and post-ADT cycles are illustrated in Figure 6a,b, respectively, and the
corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 6. Furthermore, to investigate the pathways
regarding the ORR performances of Cu@Pd/Pt-H, changes in the surface
chemical environment are revealed by CV analysis at selected ADT cycles
(Figure 6c). According
to Figure 6a, the intensity
of the EOads peak progressively
decreases with the ADT cycle and is attenuated by ΔH1 after 36k ADT cycles (please put ΔH1 in Figure 6a). Such a suppression of the EOads peak can be attributed to removal of oxide
species from the NC surface. It reduces oxygen adsorption energy as
consistently proved by increase of Eonset by 2% and decrease of the Pt/Pd-oxide reduction peak EOdes by ΔH2 as compared to the initial state (Figure 6d). In addition, the position of the EOdes peak is shifted to the right
by 0.04 V. The two observations integrally show the suppression of
oxygen species in Cu@Pd/Pt by H2 annealing. To figure out
the stability of experimental NCs in ORR, residual currents (JR) at 0.85 V (vs RHE) at selected cycles are
compared in Figure 6e. Accordingly, the JR of Cu@Pd/Pt-H
is improved by 29.3% after ADT for 36 000 cycles and exhibits
the strongest resistance to oxidative corrosion or OH passivation
compared to J.M.-Pt/C (JR decreased by
37.2% after 31 000 ADT cycles). In Figure 6e, the residual current is normalized by
the current density in the first cycle. For Cu@Pd/Pt, the abnormal
current fluctuation of the ADT curve is due to surface oxidation of
NCs during the sample exposure to ambient storage between each 5000
cycles, and the measurement was stopped at 40 000 cycles due
to detachment of the NC slurry film from the rotation disk electrode.
These results are consistent with our previous discovery that the
decoration of Pt clusters can keep ORR performance of Cu@Pd NC. However,
in the same measurement scenarios, Cu@Pd/Pt-H showed a stable JR (±7%) during ADT, which demonstrates
its outstanding stability in ORR by reduction of local defects in
the near surface of NC accompanied by the formation of Cu3Pt and Pd1–xCux. For further discussions of experimental results, comparative
electrochemical and long-term stability analyses of Cu@Pd/Pt-H with
bimetallic (Cu@Pt and Pd@Pt) NCs are compared in Figure S4. Meanwhile, CV sweeping and LSV curves of pristine
and postannealed NCs for different ADT cycles are given in Figure S5. For evaluating stability in ORR, changes
on nanostructures of experimental NCs before and after ADT are investigated
by using TEM (Figure S6) and DEX (Table S2) analyses. Accordingly, Pd corrosion
is suppressed by H2 annealing, which could be the reason
for the improved ORR stability for Cu@Pd/Pt-H as compared to that
of Cu@Pd/Pt.

3 Conclusions
In this study, ternary Cu@Pd/Pt NC was
designed with Cucluster-in-Pdcluster and Pt
cluster decoration on the surface
for ORR application in alkaline electrolyte. Such synthesized NCs
were subjected to reduction annealing in a H2 environment.
The as-obtained NC showed excellent electrocatalytic activity as well
as durability toward ORR in alkaline medium compared to the commercial
J.M.-Pt/C catalyst. Most importantly, Cu@Pd/Pt-H NC showed SA (0.536
mA cm–2), which is almost twice as that of pristine
(i.e., for Cu@Pd/Pt: 0.265 mA cm–2) and J.M.-Pt/C
(0.261 mA cm–2). An exceptional stability in a long-term
ADT for different cycles is achieved. An even impressive result is
that, for Cu@Pd/Pt-H, after 36 000 ADT cycles, residual current
density is increased by 29% as compared to its original value. By
cross-referencing the results of local and crystal structural parameters,
we demonstrate that the improvements of SA and JR in ORR can be attributed to the formation of Cu3Pt and Pd1–xCux alloys accompanied by the reduction of local interface
defects by H2 annealing on Cu@Pd/Pt. This reduction annealing
is conventionally available, which can be an effective assessment
the development of
long-stability cathodic NCs in alkaline fuel cells.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Cucluster-in-Pdcluster (Cu@Pd) Nanocrystals
Cu@Pd NC was
synthesized
by using a sequential wet chemical reduction method. Reaction steps
for synthesis methodology are presented in Scheme 1 (steps 1–3). In the first step, carbon
nanotube support (CNT, Cnano Technology Ltd.) is acid-treated in 4.0
M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 6 h for the sake of
strengthening the attachment of metallic crystals on their surface.
After that, CNT powder is washed by distilled water until the pH value
of rinsing water is 6.0. The CNT is then mixed with Cu precursor solution,
which is made up of 0.023 mmol copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 30 g of
distilled water. The mixture is stirred at 200 rpm at 25 °C for
6 h. After mixing, 3.0 g of water solution containing 10 mg of sodium
borohydride (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) is added in the mixture to reduce
Cu ions (solution A). In this step, excess molecular ratio of NaBH4 (0.252 mmol) was added to ensure complete metal reduction
and stabilize metastable metallic Cu cluster in the reaction system.
After stirring at 200 rpm for 10 s, 1.0 g water solution of Pd precursor
(containing ∼24.2 mg, ∼0.023 mmol, of Pd ions) is added
to solution A and form solution B. In this step, Pd ions are reduced
by the excessive amount of NaBH4 added in the first step
and deposit on Cu surfaces. The Pd precursor solution was prepared
by dissolving powder of Pd metal (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in the solution
of DI water and HCl with the weight ratio of 9:1 (1.0 M HCl(aq) solution). The Pd powder is sub-micrometer in diameter with a specific
surface area of 40–60 m2/g (CAS number 7440-05-3).
Such a sub-micrometer particle is chemically active and could be dissolved
in HCl solution. More specifically, 1.5 g of palladium chloride (PdCl2) is mixed in a 100 mL sample vial with 10 times diluted aqueous
hydrochloric acid solution (22 g) + 84.6 g DI water. The atomic ratio
of Pd/Cu is 1.0 in solution B.

Evolutions in Reaction Steps

4.2 Synthesis of Atomic Pt Cluster-Decorated Cucluster-in-Pdcluster Nanocrystals and Reduction
Annealing
Pt precursor solution was prepared in advance by
diluting ∼13.3 mg of H2PtCl6·6H2O (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) to 500 mg with distilled water.
Once the reaction was complete in solution B, Pt precursor solution
was added into solution B. In this stage, the Pt clusters are intercalated
in the Pd shell region by a galvanic replacement of Pt4+ to Pd followed by the reduction of residual metal ions by a reducing
agent (NaBH4). The resulting powder is washed several times
with acetone, centrifuged, and then dried at 70 °C. Henceforth,
the Pt cluster-deposited Cu@Pd NC is called Cu@Pd/Pt. As-prepared
Cu@Pd/Pt NC was annealed at 600 K in a hydrogen environment (H2/N2::9:1) for 2 h followed by natural cooling at
room temperature. In this study, postannealed Cu@Pd/Pt NC is called
Cu@Pd/Pt-H.

4.3 Preparation of the Electrode
and the Method
for ORR Activity Experiment
The slurry sample for the ORR
experiment was made by dispersing 5.0 mg of CNT-supported catalyst
in 1.0 mL of isopropanol containing 50 μL of Nafion-117 (99%,
Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min prior
to the ORR test. For conducting the ORR test, 10.0 μL of catalyst
slurry was casted and air-dried on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode
(0.196 cm2 area) as the working electrode. Hg/HgCl2 (the voltage was calibrated by 0.242 V, in alignment with
that of RHE) electrode saturated in KCL aqueous solution and a platinum
wire were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode,
respectively. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the experimental
catalysts were calculated by acquiring the Coulombic charge for reduction
of Pt or Pd oxides after integration and double-layer correction using
the following equation 1  where Qref denotes
the charge required for reduction of monolayer oxide from the bright
Pt surface (i.e., 0.405 mC cm–2), m stands for metal
loading, and QPt represents the charge
required for oxygen desorption, which is calculated by the following
equation 2  Here, ν is the scan rate for cyclic
voltametry (CV) analysis and integral parts refer to the area under
the Pt/Pd oxide reduction peak in CV curves.

The kinetic current
density (JK) was calculated based on the
following equation: 3  where J, JK, and JL are the experimentally measured, mass transport
free kinetic, and diffusion-limited current densities, respectively.
For each NC, the MA and SA were obtained when JK was normalized to the Pt loading and ECSA, respectively.
Slopes of LSV curve linear fits at half current potential (normally
at inflection point) are adopted to the Koutecky–Levich (K–L)
equation (eqs 2 and 3) to calculate the number of electrons transferred
in ORR. 4   5  where J is the measured current
density, JK and JL are the kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities,
respectively, ω is the angular velocity, n is
transferred electron number, F is the Faraday constant, Co is the bulk concentration of O2, Do is the diffusion coefficient, v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte, and k is the electron-transfer rate constant.

4.4 Characterization of Experimental NCs
The surface morphologies
of as-prepared NCs were analyzed by using
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) operated
at a voltage of 200 kV in the Electron Microscopy Center at National
Sun Yat-Sen University. Average coherent length of experimental NCs
is calculated from XRD peak broadening of (111) facets using the Scherrer
equation. For XRD analysis, the incident X-ray of wavelength 0.688
Å (18.0 keV) was used at beamline of BL-01C2 at National Synchrotron
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed to identify the surface chemical
states of the experimental NCs at BL-24A of NSRRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan).
The XAS spectra of experimental NCs were measured in the fluorescence
mode at the BL01C1 and 17C beamlines at NSRRC (Taiwan) and at the
beamline of BL-12B2 at Spring-8 (Japan). A Si monochromator was employed
to adequately select the energy with a resolution ΔE/E better than 10–4 at the Pt
L3 edge (11 564 eV). All catalysts were dispersed
uniformly on the tape and prepared as thin pellets with an appropriate
absorption thickness (μx = 1.0, where μ
is the X-ray attenuation coefficient at the absorption edge and x is the thickness of the sample) to attain a proper edge
jump step at the absorption edge region. To acquire acceptable quality
spectra with good quality, each measurement was repeated at least
twice and averaged for successive comparison. For the EXAFS analysis,
the backgrounds of the pre-edge and the postedge were subtracted and
normalized with respect to the edge jump step from the XAS spectra.
The normalized spectra were transformed from energy to k-space and further weighted by k3 to
distinguish the contributions of backscattering interferences from
different coordination shells.

The electrochemical measurements
were carried out at room temperature using a potentiostat (CH Instruments
model 600B, CHI 600B) equipped with a three-electrode system. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data were measured
at the voltage scan rates of 0.02 and 0.001 V s–1 and potential ranges of 0.1–1.3 V (V vs RHE) and 0.4–1.1
V (V vs RHE), respectively, in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte solution
of 0.1 M KOH (pH 13). The rotation rate of 1600 rpm was used for LSV.
N2 and O2 atmospheres were used for CV and LSV,
respectively. Electrochemical stability of the ternary NCs was characterized
using an accelerated durability test (ADT) in the potential range
of 0.5–1.0 V (V vs RHE) with the applied scan rate of 0.05
V s–1 in O2 atmosphere for different
ADT cycles.
