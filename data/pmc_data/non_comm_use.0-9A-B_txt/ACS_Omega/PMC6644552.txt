A series
of zirconium-based catalysts were prepared for the selective
transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural (FFR) into furfuryl
alcohol with lower alcohols as hydrogen sources. The sample structures
were clearly characterized using various methods, such as X-ray powder
diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscope,
NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, and nitrogen physisorption. Excellent furfuryl alcohol yield
of 98.9 mol % was achieved over Zr(OH)4 using 2-propanol
as a hydrogen donor at 447 K. The poisoning experiments indicated
that basic centers displayed pronounced effect for FFR transfer hydrogenation.
Moderate monoclinic phase content in ZrO2-x enhanced the conversion rate and furfuryl alcohol selectivity, whereas
acid–basic site density ratio had slight influence on FFR conversion.
Besides, Zr(OH)4 revealed good performance and stability
after being repeated four times. The possible mechanism for this transfer
hydrogenation process over Zr(OH)4 catalyst with 2-propanol
as the hydrogen source was proposed.

1 Introduction
The rapid depletion of
fossil fuel resources and significant deterioration
of environmental problems have motivated the researchers worldwide
to explore alternative renewable feedstocks for the sustainable manufacture
of liquid fuels and chemicals.1−5 In recent decades, the catalytic conversion of biomass and related
derivatives to chemicals has received wide range of attention. Furfural
(FFR), a potential platform for value-added compounds, is mainly obtained
by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and dehydration of C5 carbohydrates.6−10 Among the conversion routes, catalytic reduction of FFR is of great
interest, which gives a variety of value-added compounds, such as
2-methylfuran, cyclopentanone, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and furfuryl
alcohol (FA).11−14 Particularly, FA is considered as one of the most important derivatives
that serves as precursor for the production of synthetic fibers, plastics,
resins, liquid fuels, lubricants, dispersing agents, fine chemicals,
and so on.15,16

Generally, FA can be produced
by the gas-phase or liquid-phase
hydrogenation of FFR over supported metallic (i.e., Pd, Cu, Co, Ru,
Pt) catalysts in pressurized hydrogen atmosphere.17−21 For instance, Yan et al. reported that hydrotalcite-derived
Cu–Cr bimetallic catalysts could give 95% FA at 473 K.22 Lesiak et al. synthesized Pd–Cu/Al2O3 for liquid-phase hydrogenation of FFR in water
at 363 K and 2 MPa H2.23 Parikh
and co-workers developed Cu–Co/SBA-15 to catalyze liquid-phase
hydrogenation of FFR, which offered a FA yield of 96.7% under optimized
conditions.24 Recently, catalytic transfer
hydrogenation (CTH) of biomass-derived FFR via Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley
(MPV) reduction has received increasing attention, in which high-pressure
gaseous hydrogen is replaced by alcohols to avoid defects, such as
storage, safety, solubility, etc. For this reason, much effort has
been devoted to the expansion of various catalysts for upgrading FFR
via the hydrogen transfer method.25−31 Marchi et al. found that Cu–Mg–Al catalyst could catalyze
FFR hydrogenation using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor.25 Panagiotopoulou et al. observed that homogeneous DyCl3 afforded nearly 100% FFR conversion and 97% FA selectivity
with 2-propanol as a hydrogen donor.26 Lee
et al. synthesized alumina–carbon composite catalysts for the
conversion of FFR in 2-propanol, with a desired FA yield of 95.8%
at 403 K for 6 h.27 Recently, low-cost
eco-friendly metal hydroxides/oxides are found to allow efficient
transformation of biomass-derived chemicals via MPV reduction in various
alcohols.32−35 For example, Dumesic’s group described the CTH of levulinic
acid and its esters into γ-valerolactone via MPV reaction over
metal oxides using alcohols as the hydrogen sources.32 Lin et al. reported an effective CTH route to convert ethyl
levulinate into γ-valerolactone over ZrO(OH)2·xH2O and ZrO2 in subcritical alcohols.33,34 Particularly, Zr-containing catalysts are much more efficient for
the CTH of biomass derivatives in the presence of alcohols.

Inspired by the above findings, a series of low-cost and environmentally
benign Zr-based materials were synthesized for the CTH of FFR. The
influences of varied reaction parameters, such as hydrogen source,
catalyst type, temperature, and catalyst dosage, were systematically
discussed to gain high FFR conversion and FA selectivity. Meanwhile,
a comprehensive structure characterization of the fresh and spent
catalysts was conducted. The results indicated that Zr(OH)4 exhibited excellent performance toward FFR transfer hydrogenation
with 2-propanol as the hydrogen source and was reusable over multiple
cycles without significant loss of activity. Furthermore, a plausible
reaction mechanism for the CTH of FFR to FA via MPV reduction over
Zr-containing materials in 2-propanol was proposed.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Furfural
(FFR, 99%) and
furfuryl alcohol (FA, 98%) were provided from Aladdin Reagent Co.
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%),
ammonia water (25–28%), butanol (anhydrous, 99%), 2-butanol
(anhydrous, 99%), ethanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), 2-propanol (anhydrous,
99.5%), and other commercially available chemicals were purchased
from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Notably,
FFR was distilled under vacuum before use.

2.2 Catalysts
Preparation
First, ZrOCl2·8H2O
was dissolved in deionized water to
obtain a 0.4 mol L–1 solution, and then NH3·H2O was added dropwise to regulate the pH value
to 9–10 under vigorous agitation, followed by aging at room
temperature for 24 h. The resulting precipitate was thoroughly washed
with deionized water until residual Cl– was completely
removed, based on 0.05 mol L–1 AgNO3 detection.
The precipitate was dried at 383 K overnight and was further ground
to obtain Zr(OH)4 powder. Then, Zr(OH)4 sample
was calcined at a heating rate of 2 K min–1 in air
flow for 3 h for the synthesis of ZrO2-x (x represents the given calcination temperatures),
in which x was varied from 623 to 1023 K with an
interval of 100 K.

2.3 Catalyst Characterization
X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Panalytical X’pert Pro
diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 40
mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained
on a Kratos Ultra system using an Al Kα radiation source. The
binding energies for each spectrum were calibrated with a C 1s spectrum
of 284.6 eV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area was determined with N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at 77 K (SI-MP-10, Quantachrome). Before test, the samples
were degassed under vacuum at 433 K for 20 h. The sample morphology
was realized on field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM,
Hitachi S-4800). Chemical analysis of leached Zr4+ was
measured by a thermo elemental inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) spectrometer.

The quantitative
analysis of acid site density was carried out on a Quantachrome ChemStar
chemisorption analyzer through NH3 temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD). For each run, the sample was heated up to 573 K
at a rate of 10 K min–1 and kept for 0.5 h in a
He flow to remove adsorbed impurities. Then, the sample was cooled
down to 373 K for the adsorption of NH3. After flushing
with He to remove physically adsorbed NH3, the TPD data
were collected from 373 to 1273 K with a ramp of 10 K min–1. CO2-TPD test was performed by using a similar procedure,
where NH3 was replaced with CO2 during the adsorption
process.

Using a SDT Q 600 instrument, thermogravimetric/differential
thermic
analyses (TGA/DTA) were measured over fresh and spent Zr(OH)4 to identify the amount of absorbed carbohydrate over the catalyst
surface. Specifically, a sample of around 200 mg was typically used
for the test at temperatures from room temperature to 1273 K, with
a heating rate of 10 K min–1 in an air atmosphere.

2.4 Catalytic Test
In a typical run,
catalyst, substrate FFR (1.2 mmol), and hydrogen source (15 mL) were
put into a 100 mL stainless steel reactor. Subsequently, the air in
the reactor was flushed out using inert atmosphere (N2)
five times. Then, the reactor was initiated at a designated temperature
with a stirring rate of 600 rpm under 1 MPa N2 atmosphere.
After predetermined time, the reactor was cooled to room temperature
in an ice water, and the filtered samples from the mixtures were further
analyzed.

2.5 Product Analysis
The quantity analysis
of liquid samples was completed on Fuli GC9790 II equipped with a
flame ionization detector and a KB-5 capillary column (30.0 m ×
0.32 μm × 0.25 μm) using nitrogen as the carry gas.
The operating conditions were as follows: injector port temperature,
533 K; column temperature, initial temperature 343 K (0.5 min), gradient
rate 5 K min–1, end temperature 428 K (0.5 min),
flow rate 75 mL min–1.

The formulas for calculating
FFR conversion, FA yield, and selectivity are defined below      

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst
Characterization
Figure 1 shows X-ray diffraction
patterns of prepared zirconium-based materials. Specifically, fresh
and recycled Zr(OH)4 exhibited similar patterns with two
broad and weak peaks in an angle range from 25 to 60°, suggesting
that the samples were characteristic of an amorphous structure and
no new phase was observed after reuse. Through calcination treatment,
typical peaks composed of monoclinic and tetragonal phases were obviously
formed in ZrO2-x (x =
623, 723, 823, 923, and 1023). Noticeably, XRD spectrum of ZrO2-623 revealed typical peaks of tetragonal zirconia at 30.2
and 50.3° that agreed well with that of the standard pattern
of JCPDS file no. 79-1769.36,37 Furthermore, characteristic
peaks at 2θ of 17.4, 28.2, 31.5, 34.4, 49.3, 54.2, and 55.7°
(JCPDS file no. 37-1484), indicative of the presence of monoclinic
zirconia, were observed in ZrO2-x (x = 723, 823, 923, and 1023 K). The percentages of the monoclinic
and tetragonal phases are also given in Table 1, as calculated from corresponding peak areas.
Apparently, higher temperatures facilitated monoclinic zirconia formation,
and an increasing intensity of these peaks was observed along with
the increase in calcination temperatures.

XPS characterization
was undertaken to investigate the surface
chemical state of selected Zr-based materials. As depicted in Figure 2A, the full range
XPS spectra of prepared samples were monitored to find out C 1s, O
1s, and Zr 3d species. Clearly, high-resolution scans of the XPS spectra
of O 1s and Zr 3d with different intensity scales as ordinate are
observed in Figure 2B and C. High-resolution O 1s spectra (Figure 2B) verified two surface species with binding
energies of 529.8 and 531.3 eV for the fresh Zr(OH)4, characteristic
of ZrO2 and Zr-OH, respectively. This result further indicated
that prepared Zr(OH)4 might actually existed in the form
of ZrO(OH)2·xH2O. However,
calcination favored surface dehydroxylation at high temperatures,
which produced zirconium oxides in various crystalline forms. Therefore,
it is clearly seen that characteristic peak at 531.3 eV assigned to
Zr-OH gradually disappeared in the ZrO2-x (x = 623, 723, 823, 923, and 1023) samples. With
respect to Zr 3d species, the binding energies of corresponding photoelectron
peaks were allocated to 181.8 eV for the Zr 3d5/2 line
and 184.2 eV for the Zr 3d3/2 line, indicating the presence
of Zr4+ species in ZrO2 and Zr-OH (Figure 2C).

(B) O 1s; (C) Zr 3d.

The textural characterizations of zirconium-based materials
are
further analyzed via N2 physisorption. As indicated in Figure 3A, weak interaction
between synthesized Zr-based samples and N2 in low-pressure
region (P/P0: 0–0.1)
was observed, especially for ZrO2-x obtained
at higher temperatures above 723 K. Typically, Zr(OH)4 and
ZrO2-x (x = 623 and 723)
were characteristic of IV isotherm with a H2 hysteresis loop, whereas
ZrO2-823, ZrO2-923, and ZrO2-1023
revealed V isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop. Table 1 summarizes the resulting BET surface area
and total pore volume, it is clearly seen that fresh Zr(OH)4 had larger BET surface area and total pore volume of 242.3 m2 g–1 and 0.21 cm3 g–1 respectively, as compared with those of calcined ZrO2-x samples. Actually, higher calcination temperatures
(>623 K) cause a significant drop in the BET surface area and total
pore volume, presumably attributable to particles crystallization.
For the spent Zr(OH)4, an acceptable drop in the BET surface
area and total pore volume was mainly due to the presence of carbon
residues. Figure 3B
also gives the pore width distributions of prepared Zr-based materials.
In comparison, the pore diameters of Zr(OH)4 and ZrO2-x (x = 623 and 723) centered
at around 3–5 nm, whereas larger pore diameters in a size range
of 15–45 nm appeared for ZrO2-x (x = 823, 923, and 1023) samples. It is inferred
that small particles crystallization and sintering under higher temperatures
might be responsible for the occurrence of larger pore diameters.

Figure 3 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (A) and pore
width distributions (B) of prepared zirconium-based materials.

Figure 4 presents
the SEM images of zirconium-based materials. It is apparent that fresh
and spent Zr(OH)4 consisted of amorphous crystallites in
a size of around 20 nm, which was well consistent with that of XRD
test. No obvious variation in the primary crystallite size and the
surface morphology were detected before and after use (Figure 4A,B,F). For the calcined samples,
the crystallite size increased to 50−100 nm with elevating the temperature to 823
K, and then much crystallites in an irregular shape were identified
at 1023 K (Figure 4E).

ZrO2-823; (E) ZrO2-1023; and (F) spent Zr(OH)4.

TGA–DTA analysis was conducted
to evaluate the carbon deposits
on the spent Zr(OH)4 (after the third run). As described
in Figure 5, fresh
Zr(OH)4 afforded an initial weight loss of 3.5 wt % before
being heated to around 385 K, and the existence of physisorbed water
and surface hydroxyl groups largely accounted for this phenomenon.
A further weight loss of 8.8 wt % was recorded from 390 to 730 K owing
to the removal of intercalated water, implying the structure transformation
of amorphous Zr(OH)4 into crystalline zirconia,38 in good accordance with the results from XRD
and SEM analyses. Weight loss of 9.3 wt % in the TGA profile of spent
Zr(OH)4 was registered in the temperature range of 410–800
K, suggesting that only small quantity of organic carbon compounds
accumulated on the catalyst surface during the recycling experiments.
Furthermore, TGA curves showed that the practical weight losses of
both of the fresh and recycled samples were much lower than the theoretical
value of 22.6 wt %, indicating that the actual state of catalyst might
existed as ZrO(OH)2·xH2O, rather than Zr(OH)4.39,40

profiles of fresh and spent Zr(OH)4.

NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD measurements were
investigated
to characterize the acid–basic properties (Scheme 1) and concentration in the
synthesized materials, and the acid–basic site density and
ratio of acidity to basicity were provided in Table 1. Figure 6 shows the TPD profiles of desorbed ammonia, medium
to strong acid sites at desorption temperature range of 640–800
K could be identified for all samples. For fresh Zr(OH)4, intensive desorption peaks at ∼700 K indicated the presence
of higher level of acid site density. However, the calcined samples
ZrO2-x (x = 623, 723,
823, 923, and 1023) revealed relatively moderate acid site density.
Generally, higher temperatures led to the reconfiguration of surface
structure, in which much water molecules were removed from the initial
structure. In this regard, the amount of coordination unsaturated
Zr4+ species increased significantly, but the Brønsted
acid sites decreased due to the diminishing of surface hydroxyl groups
and protons. On the other hand, higher temperature treatment resulted
in a rapid decline in BET surface area, therefore the amount of surface
metal ions available was reduced as well, finally leading to a significant
decrease in Lewis acid sites. On the basis of above discussion, the
total surface acid amount would be much lowered for calcined ZrO2 catalysts, especially for high-temperature-treated ZrO2-x. In the CO2-TPD profiles (Figure 7), a broad CO2 desorption peak assigned to the strong basic sites occurred
at ∼800 K. It is obvious that medium basic sites at desorption
temperature of 450 K were dominant in Zr(OH)4 sample. Intriguingly,
in the ZrO2-x (x = 623,
723, 823, 923, and 1023), the peak of medium temperature region shifted
to a higher temperature. As is well known, the Zr4+–O2– acid–basic pair sites existed in the prepared
catalysts, so total surface basic content also was gradually lowered
for ZrO2-x samples, as compared with Zr(OH)4. Also interesting is that A/B value of ZrO2-x first rose and then dropped, with the increase in calcination
temperature. It is concluded that Zr-containing samples obtained via
calcination treatment, with relatively larger amount of tetragonal
phase, could contribute to higher acid–basic concentration.

3.2 Catalytic Activity
The catalytic
activity of synthesized zirconium series for the transfer hydrogenation
of FFR was discussed. First, the reaction was conducted at 423 K with
ethanol as both the solvent and hydrogen donor, and the catalyst dosage
was set to 75 mg. As shown in Table 2 (runs 1–6), different Zr-based catalysts exhibited
significant variations in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation performance.
Zr(OH)4 catalyst gave a high FA yield of 39.0 mol % after
2.5 h, with a remarkable FA selectivity of 65.9%. In the case of calcined
ZrO2-x (x = 623, 723,
823, 923, and 1023), lower selectivity to FA was observed at similar
conversions, particularly for ZrO2-923 and ZrO2-1023. The higher activity of Zr(OH)4 could be due to
the appropriate acid–basic site concentration, larger surface
area, and higher total pore volume, thus facilitating H-transfer process
during FFR conversion.

To get more insight toward understanding
the activity discrepancy
among above materials, probable correlations between ratios of A/B
and M/T (monoclinic phase to tetragonal phase) and catalytic activity
are put forward in Figure 8. As indicated in Figure 8A, A/B ratio had very little impact on FFR conversion.
Zr(OH)4 bearing much more medium to strong acid–basic
sites effectively catalyzed FFR hydrogenation into FA with a high
selectivity, whereas ZrO2-x possessing
insufficient acid–basic sites gave poor FA selectivity. Although
relative strong acid–basic sites appeared in the calcined ZrO2-x, the limited amount of Zr4+–O2– acid–basic pair sites and higher
A/B ratios (above 1.0) reduced the transfer hydrogen capacity. As
for M/T ratio effect, it is observed that moderate monoclinic phase
content enhanced the conversion rate and FA selectivity. Usually high
temperatures caused the phase change that produced large number of
monoclinic ZrO2. In this aspect, diminishing of surface
hydroxyl groups and BET surface area also occurred for those monoclinic
ZrO2, thus resulting in the decrease of acid–basic
site density. It is known that acid–basic sites played a crucial
role in the MPV reduction of FFR,41 therefore
catalysts containing high content of monoclinic ZrO2 showed
weak activity for FFR transfer hydrogenation. Compared comprehensively,
amorphous Zr(OH)4, featuring with high acid–basic
site density, exhibited outstanding activity for FA synthesis via
the H-transfer method.

Figure 8 Effects of A/B and M/T ratios on FFR transfer hydrogenation.

Subsequently, the influences of
hydrogen sources on the conversion
of FFR into FA were thoroughly investigated (Table 2, runs 1 and 7–11). Generally, the
hydrogen-donating capacity for FFR transfer hydrogenation greatly
depends on the reduction potential of applied reducing lower alcohols,
i.e., the lower reduction potential of alcohols, the stronger the
reducing capacity. According to the previously reported literatures,42,43 the reduction potential of reducing alcohols were ranked in the
following sequence: methanol > ethanol > 1-butanol > 2-butanol
> 2-propanol.
Thus methanol, with higher reduction potential, showed the poor CTH
capacity for FFR upgrading (Table 2, run 7). The secondary alcohol, especially 2-propanol,
had the lowest reduction potential, revealing the great reducing capacity
for H-transfer procedure. As expected, conversion of FFR reached 95.7
mol % in 2-propanol, with a FA selectivity of 96.1% (Table 2, run 8). In the case of 2-butanol,
42.6 mol % yield toward FA was obtained with a 61.6% selectivity,
whereas undesirable results were found in the presence of butanol
under identical conditions. On the basis of above discussion, 2-propanol
was selected as the optimal hydrogen donor for subsequent experiments.

In the following experiments, several poisoning tests were designed
by introducing extra additives to gain more insight toward the role
of active sites for the CTH of FFR via MPV reduction. Generally, pyridine
is an effective agent in passivating active acid sites, whereas boric
acid showed good capacity in passivating basic centers. As observed
from Table 2 (runs
12 and 13), the addition of pyridine had slight influence on FFR conversion
and FA selectivity, whereas significant decline in the activity was
observed when same amount of boric acid was added. The lower selectivity
to FA after boric acid poisoning could be ascribed to the imbalance
acid–base couple sites, and 2,2′-difurfuryl ether and
4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one were formed through acid sites-catalyzed
etherification and aldol condensation reactions, respectively. The
above results implied that Zr(OH)4 catalyst is rather irritable
to boric acid, thus the active basic site of catalyst was demonstrated
to display much more pronounced effect for this reaction. On the other
hand, it can be concluded that synergistic effect of acid–basic
couple sites in Zr-containing materials also was very important for
MPV reduction of FFR.

The influence of temperature on the catalytic
transfer hydrogenation
of FFR with 2-propanol was investigated using Zr(OH)4 in
a range of 403–453 K. As indicated in Figure 9, within a 2.5 h of CTH reaction at 403 K,
the conversion of FFR was up to 78.3 mol %. Subsequently, elevating
the reaction temperature to 423 and 433 K gave a higher FFR conversion
of 95.7 and 97.5 mol %, respectively. Besides, the selectivity to
FA remained high (around 90.0%) for reaction temperature below 443
K. A further rise in the temperature to 453 K also significantly increased
the FFR conversion to 99.8 mol %, but decreased the FA selectivity
to 87.9%, probably caused by the formations of furan-based polymers
via acidic–basic sites-catalyzed condensation reactions.44,45 Therefore, the optimum temperature for this reaction was set to
443 K.

Figure 9 Effect of reaction temperature on transfer hydrogenation of FFR
with 2-propanol. Conditions: FFR 1.2 mmol, 2-propanol 15 mL, Zr(OH)4 75 mg, 2.5 h, 600 rpm, N2 1 MPa.

Figure 10 depicts
the effect of catalyst dosage ranging from 65 to 85 mg on FA formation
as a function of reaction time, with the aim of finding the optimum
conditions. One can clearly observe that the FA yield was greatly
promoted at higher dosage that achieved a promising level of 81.5
mol % at a dosage of 85 mg in 0.5 h. One reasonable explanation is
that the increased total number of active acid and basic sites accelerated
the progress of CTH process, thus facilitating the gradual accumulation
of targeted product FA. Generally, properly increasing time facilitated
the rapid generation of FA. It is noted that lower catalyst dosage
might require longer reaction time to reach the equilibrium state
due to insufficient active sites. For 75 mg catalyst dosage, the FA
yield gradually increased as the reaction proceeded, which achieved
the appreciable value of 98.9 mol % yield of FA at nearly complete
conversion in 2.5 h. It is noteworthy that remarkable decrease in
the yield and selectivity toward FA was observed with the further
prolonging of reaction time, which could be ascribable to the appearance
of etherification reaction. After 3.0 h of reaction, the total yield
of 2,2′-difurfuryl ether and 2-(isopropoxymethyl)furan reached
up to ∼15 mol %. Therefore, the optimal catalyst dosage of
75 mg and reaction time of 2.5 h were adopted for the CTH reaction
of FFR.

Figure 10 Effect of catalyst dosage and reaction time on transfer hydrogenation
of FFR with 2-propanol. Conditions: FFR 1.2 mmol, 2-propanol 15 mL,
Zr(OH)4, 443 K, 600 rpm, N2 1 MPa.

Herein, we further evaluated the reusability of
the most active
catalyst Zr(OH)4 for the transfer hydrogenation of FFR
at 443 K. After each recycling experiment, the spent catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, followed by being
repeatedly washed with plenty of deionized water. After drying at
323 K overnight, the catalyst was tested again under identical conditions.
Specific surface area and TGA–DTA characterizations of spent
catalyst indicated the adsorption of certain amounts of carbohydrates
on the catalyst surface, which prevented the sufficient contact between
FFR and acid–basic sites. Thus, slight decrease in the FFR
conversion from 99.8 to 92.1 mol % was observed after three consecutive
runs, as revealed in Figure 11. In the following two runs, the catalyst displayed relatively
good performance, in which the FFR conversion remained around 90 mol
%. Elemental analysis of Zr4+ in the solution after five
successive cycles by ICP-AES revealed that Zr4+ concentration
was below the limit of detection. The aforementioned results reflected
the good stability and reusability of Zr(OH)4.

catalyst. Conditions: FFR 1.2 mmol, 2-propanol 15 mL,
Zr(OH)4 75 mg, 443 K, 2.5 h, 600 rpm, N2 1 MPa.

Comparison of catalytic activity
among various catalysts is presented
in the Table 3. It
can be seen that 2-propanol was a common choice and served as an excellent
hydrogen donor for the CTH of FFR. In comparison of catalyst type,
bifunctional zirconium N-alkyltriphosphate nanohybrid
(ZrPN), characteristic of high basicity/acidity, exhibited better
activity at 413 K.30 Homogeneous Lewis
acid catalyst (DyCl3) effectively converted FFR into FA
using 2-propanol as the solvent and hydrogen donor,26 however, issues, including product separation and catalyst
reuse, were also put forward. Other metallic catalysts, such as γ-Fe2O3@HAP, Fe-L1/C-800, and Cu/AC–SO3H, could give good FFR conversion (above 90%) at relatively higher
temperatures or within longer reaction time.28,29,31 By contrast, Zr(OH)4 synthesized
by the simple precipitation method displayed desirable activity toward
FFR transfer hydrogenation, and nearly complete conversion rate and
98.9% FA yield were achieved in a 2.5 h reaction.

On the basis of the above experimental results and
previous literatures,32−35,46−48 a plausible
reaction mechanism for the CTH reaction of FFR via MPV reduction over
Zr(OH)4 was suggested, as illustrated in Scheme 2. First, adsorption of 2-propanol
into the catalyst occurred, followed by dissociation to the corresponding
alkoxide A. Next, the aldehyde group in FFR matched well with alkoxide
A to produce a six-membered ring transition state B. Then, hydrogen
transfer took place between activated FFR and alkoxide in a concerted
manner, with the formation of intermediate C. Meanwhile, the new carbonyl
chemical acetone was released from intermediate species C and generated
the intermediate D. Finally, another 2-propanol molecule participated
in the reaction, giving off the end product FA as well as initial
active site alkoxide A. As mentioned earlier,49 each step in the cycle of FFR transfer hydrogenation was supposed
to be reversible.

FA Catalyzed
by Zr(OH)4 via CTH Reaction with 2-Propanol as a Hydrogen
Donor
4 Conclusions
In summary, we prepared a series of zirconium-based catalysts for
the synthesis of FA via a CTH process using 2-propanol as a hydrogen
donor. Among these catalysts, Zr(OH)4 with much more medium
to strong acid–basic sites and high acid–basic site
density was identified as the most active one, in which a yield of
98.9 mol % FA was achieved at nearly 100 mol % conversion. As comparison,
ZrO2-x possessing insufficient acid–basic
sites only gave poor FA selectivity. High calcination temperatures
resulted in the formation of monoclinic ZrO2 in large numbers,
but resulting poorer BET surface area and pore volume were not conducive
to the transfer hydrogenation of FFR into FA. Relatively, proper amount
of monoclinic ZrO2 in calcined samples improved the conversion
rate and FA selectivity, and acid–basic site density ratio
had slight influence on FFR conversion. Moreover, the poisoning experiments
revealed that active basic sites on the catalyst surface displayed
pronounced effect for FFR conversion. Furthermore, the Zr(OH)4 catalyst exhibited good performance and stability that was
reusable over multiple cycles without significant loss of catalytic
activity. The possible reaction mechanism for this CTH process over
Zr(OH)4 with 2-propanol as the hydrogen source was proposed.
