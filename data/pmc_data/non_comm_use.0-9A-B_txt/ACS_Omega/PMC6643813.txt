Liquids
in nanoporous media are exposed to an adsorption-induced
pressure, a consequence of the interaction with the pore surface.
The smaller the pore diameter, dP, the
higher the pressure at saturation and thus the bulk modulus of the
confined liquid. Therefore, it has been proposed to use ultrasonic
measurements on saturated nanoporous media for the determination of
the average pore size. Here, we discuss the requirements for such
an analysis. Although predictions for the size-dependent pore pressure
and the liquid’s modulus, Kiso(dP), are based on isothermal simulations, an
experimentalist studying the propagation of ultrasonic waves determines
adiabatic moduli, Kad(dP). We show that the quantity relating adiabatic and isothermal
moduli, the heat capacity ratio γ = cp/cv = Kad/Kiso, exhibits a strong pressure dependence
for many bulk liquids. In nanopores, this translates into a size-dependent
γ(dP), provided the confinement
does not alter the heat capacity ratio. Disregarding this effect in
the analysis of ultrasonic data would yield an underestimate of the
isothermal modulus and thus an overestimate of the average pore size.
For a correct analysis, an experimentalist thus needs to know the
size dependence of three quantities: the isothermal modulus, adsorption-induced
pressure, and heat capacity ratio.

1 Introduction
It is well known that
the adsorption of a fluid in a porous material
causes a pressure on the pore surface.1−4 This pressure induces a deformation of the
porous matrix, which was observed for a multitude of porous materials
during the adsorption of a gaseous, liquid, or supercritical fluid.2−24 The effect of sorption-induced deformation is a very common phenomenon
in nature as a result of the great number of natural porous materials
(e.g., shales, clays, coal gangue, charcoal, and sandstones). Several
of these media possess pores with a diameter in the range of nanometers.25,26 The matrix’s reaction upon sorption of fluids can be exploited
for several technical applications. Among others, porous matrices
may be used as actuators.27

In recent
years, a further impact of the deforming pressure caused
by adsorbed liquids was revealed by ultrasonic and theoretical studies:
the change of the elasticity of the adsorbate.28−35 The deforming pressure, usually termed solvation pressure (pS) or adsorption stress, has different contributions.3 For a given sample, the solvation pressure changes
when the curvature of the liquid–vapor interface is modified,
e.g., during the initial (isothermal) desorption process.3,18,29 Such a change of the so-called
Laplace pressure causes an almost linear change of the longitudinal
modulus of the adsorbate [shown for argon (see refs (29) and (36)) and implicitly also for n-hexane (see ref (28))]. The strength of interaction between the adsorbate and
pore surface might also modify the adsorption pressure. Thus, different
adsorbates exhibit a varying deviation of their elastic moduli from
the corresponding bulk values.37−39 For a fully saturated sample,
the solvation pressure is inversely proportional to the pore radius.3 Accordingly, theoretical studies for argon in
smooth silica pores showed that the isothermal bulk modulus of adsorbed
argon, KAr,adsiso, is proportional to the inverse pore size
(i.e., KAr,adsiso ∝ 1/dP with the pore diameter dP).30−32

These theoretical findings on the impact of the pore size
on the
elastic modulus of the adsorbate could be used for the determination
of the pore size using ultrasound as proposed by Gor.30 In contrast to standard procedures,40−42 such a new
method does not require the measurement of a complete sorption isotherm.
For the extraction of the elastic properties of the confined fluid
from measured effective moduli, only ultrasonic measurements on the
empty and saturated sample are needed (see, e.g., refs (34), (43), and (44)). Then, the average pore
size can be found directly through a comparison with the theoretical
calibration curve [KAr,adsiso(dP)].
However, the theoretical calculations and simulations yield the pore
size dependence of the isothermal values of the moduli, whereas the
ultrasonic experiments yield the adiabatic moduli.30,31 Thus, the experimental values have to be converted to the isothermal
values or vice versa. Generally, the adiabatic and the isothermal
moduli, Kad and Kiso, are related to each other via the heat capacity ratio
γ = cp/cv = Kad/Kiso. Here, we study the pressure dependence of this ratio and its influence
on the dependence of the adiabatic modulus on the pore size. Our findings
are relevant for the correct determination of the pore size using
the combination of ultrasound and simulations.

2 Data, Analysis,
and Discussion
Recently, calculations of Gor30 showed
that the isothermal modulus KAr,adsiso of argon in smooth nanopores
exhibits a proportionality on the inverse pore size (see Figure 1a). This observation
is a consequence of an increasing adsorption stress (or solvation
pressure) with a decreasing pore size (see Figure 1b). For the determination of the quantities
displayed in Figure 1, Gor used classical density functional theory (DFT) (see ref (30) for details). The data
in Figure 1a show that
the effect of an enhancement of the adsorbate’s modulus is
significant. For the smallest pores with a diameter of 2 nm (1/dP = 0.5/nm), the modulus is increased by a factor
of ≈1.9 in comparison to the modulus of nonconfined argon, KAr,bulkiso.

Figure 1 (a) Isothermal bulk modulus KAr,adsiso of liquid argon in spherical nanopores (scaled to the isothermal
modulus of bulk argon, KAr,bulkiso, at p0) and (b) adsorption stress (also termed solvation pressure, pS) as a function of the inverse pore diameter
at 80 K. The data are from ref (30). Both quantities exhibit a linear relation to the inverse
pore diameter. The lines are fits to the data.

With the knowledge of the dependence of KAr,adsiso on
the
pore size, it is possible to determine an average pore size of a sample,
if the isothermal modulus of adsorbed argon is known from measurements.
Such a new method for the determination of the pore size was already
indicated by Gor30 when he published the
results shown in Figure 1 (see also ref (31)). However, ultrasonic measurements yield the adiabatic values for
the moduli, not the isothermal ones. Both quantities are related to
each other via the ratio of specific heat, γ:  1  Generally, the heat capacity
ratio depends
on temperature. The corresponding γ-values for bulk argon at
its vapor pressure p0 (and at higher pressures)
decrease with decreasing temperature, as shown
in Figure 2a. The DFT
calculations of Gor30 were performed for
confined liquid argon at 80 K. In contrast to nanoconfined argon,43,47 bulk argon solidifies already near 84 K.46 Thus, for the conversion of the moduli shown in Figure 1, it is necessary to extrapolate
γ to 80 K (see Figure 2a). The authors in refs (30), (31), and (36) argued that the “parameter γ is not sensitive to pressure”31 and consequently a constant γ-value (at
the bulk vapor pressure γ = 1.979 at 80 K) could be used for
the conversion between isothermal and adiabatic moduli. However, a
study of the literature values for γ reveals a decrease of γ
with increasing pressure (see Figure 2a,b). This strong pressure dependence of the heat capacity
ratio significantly influences the values for KAr,adsad, in particular
for small nanopores. Due to the lack of data below the melting point
of argon, we have approximated the pressure dependence of the heat
capacity ratio at 80 K with a simple equation: γ = γ(p0) – ap/(bp + 1). For the determination of constants a and b, we used the values of γ at three pressures (p0, p = 24 MPa, and p = 65 MPa; see Figure 2a). The resulting curve is shown in Figure 2b as a dotted line (T = 80 K). The dotted lines at higher temperatures were
calculated via the same procedure. In the range where data is available,
the agreement between fit and data is so good that the respective
curves in Figure 2b
coincide and cannot be distinguished. What is important in the following
analysis is not the accuracy of the extrapolated data but the fact
that γ depends on pressure. This has an impact on the conversion
between isothermal and adiabatic data and thus on the respective size
dependence: 2  Under the simplifying assumption of a constant
(pressure-independent) heat capacity ratio γ(p) = γ(p0), the relative change
of the adiabatic modulus is of course the same as for the isothermal
modulus (see also Figure 1a and red symbols in Figure 3b,c). The decrease of γ with increasing pressure
(see Figure 2b) results
in a decrease of γ with decreasing pore size (see Figure 3a), as the adsorption pressure
increases with the inverse pore size (see Figure 1b). For example, for argon at 80 K in pores
with a diameter of dP = 2 nm, the adsorption
stress takes the value of 63 MPa (see Figure 1b). At this pressure, γ = 1.653 <
γ(p0) = 1.979 (see Figures 2b and 3a for 1/dP = 0.5/nm and 1/dP = 0) and thus γ(p)/γ(p0) = 0.835 holds. Consequently, for argon, the
effect of an enhancement of the adsorbate’s modulus is weaker
for the adiabatic modulus than that for the isothermal modulus. This
becomes noticeable in Figure 3b, which shows the adiabatic modulus as a function of the
inverse pore diameter for both a constant heat capacity ratio [red
symbols denote simplification γ(p) = γ(p0)] and the pressure-dependent γ (blue
symbols). Remarkably, also the adiabatic modulus calculated for the
pressure-dependent heat capacity ratio exhibits a proportionality
to the inverse pore diameter dP. However,
the effect of the pressure dependence of γ on the pore size
dependence of the adiabatic modulus is considerable, and as expected,
it is particularly strong for the smallest pores. The adiabatic modulus
for a pore diameter of 2 nm is increased by about ≈60% compared
to its bulk value (instead of ≈90% for the isothermal modulus).
Accordingly, the application of ultrasonic measurements for the determination
of the average pore size requires the use of the actual pressure dependence
of the heat capacity ratio. Otherwise, the pore size would be considerably
overestimated from a measured value for KAr,adsad because
the calculated value of KAr,adsiso = KAr,adsad/γ(p0) instead of Kiso = Kad/γ(p) would be too
small.

Figure 2 (a) Heat capacity ratio γ = cp/cv of bulk argon at its vapor pressure
and at higher pressures as a function of temperature (solid lines)
extrapolated to lower temperatures (dotted lines) using a fit γ(T) = γ(T = 0) + AT/(BT + 1). (b) Heat capacity ratio of bulk argon
as a function of pressure for different temperatures. Both the temperature
and pressure have a significant influence on the value of cp/cv. The impact
of pressure is particularly strong at higher temperatures. The data
are from the NIST45 (based on ref (46)). Dotted lines are extrapolated
fits (see the text).

Figure 3 (a) Heat capacity ratio γ = cp/cv of liquid argon as a function of
the inverse pore diameter, 1/dP, at 80
K [calculated from the pressure dependence of γ at 80 K (see Figure 2b) and the pore pressure
(see Figure 1b)]. (b)
and (c) Adiabatic longitudinal modulus KAr,adsad of confined
argon at 80 K as a function of (b) the inverse pore diameter, 1/dP, and (c) the pore radius rP. The values are scaled to the adiabatic
modulus for nonconfined argon, KAr,bulkad, at p0. The adiabatic moduli are calculated from the isothermal
values (see Figure 1a) under the simplifying assumption of a constant heat capacity ratio
(red symbols, γ = 1.979) as well as for the pressure-dependent
γ (blue symbols, γ(p); see panel (a)
and Figure 2b). For
a constant γ, the pore size dependence of the adiabatic modulus
would be equal to that of the isothermal modulus (see Figure 1a). Considering the pressure
dependence of γ, we conclude that the actual dependence of KAr,adsad on the pore size is considerably weaker than that for the isothermal
modulus. The strong difference between the two calculations shows
that the simplification of a constant γ leads to a severe error
in the calculated pore size, if a specific value for the adiabatic
modulus is measured.

Note that the pressure dependence of the heat capacity ratio
significantly
complicates the conversion between isothermal and adiabatic moduli
in the sense that it requires more data. Under the assumption of a
constant γ, it is necessary to know the dependence of only the
isothermal modulus on the pore size: the dependence of the adsorption
stress on the pore size is not necessary for the analysis. However,
as a result of the existing pressure dependence of γ, also the
knowledge of the pore size dependence of the adsorption stress is
indispensable.

We can generalize our finding to other liquids.
An analysis of
data from the NIST45 reveals that for many
liquids (nitrogen, alkanes, and water) the heat capacity ratio decreases
with increasing pressure (see Figure 4). Thus, the relative enhancement of the adiabatic
modulus of nanonconfined liquids is weaker than the enhancement of
the isothermal modulus. For alkanes, the pressure dependence of the
heat capacity ratio decreases with increasing chain length (see Figure 4b) and thus also
the extent of the effect of pressure on the conversion between adiabatic
and isothermal moduli. For water, the effect is very weak and the
difference is probably almost negligible.

Figure 4 (a) Pressure dependence
of the heat capacity ratio γ = cp/cv for different
liquids (argon, nitrogen, methane, hexane, dodecane, and water) at
their boiling points. Both the absolute values and the pressure dependence
differ for the various liquids. All liquids exhibit a decrease of
the heat capacity ratio with increasing pressure [see also the values
in (b) that are scaled to the value of γ at the normal boiling
point (1 atm)]. The pressure effect is particularly strong for argon
and nitrogen and very weak for water. Consequently, the pore size
dependence of the adiabatic modulus is weaker than that of the isothermal
modulus for all liquids (see text). The displayed values are calculated
from data published by the NIST.45

Theoretical analyses (DFT calculations
and simulations) must still
show whether the dependence of the adsorbate’s modulus on the
inverse pore size can be generalized to other adsorbates. However,
our above statements are independent of the actual pore size dependence
of the isothermal modulus for the different adsorbates.

3 Conclusions and Outlook
Simulations and theoretical calculations
generally supply the isothermal
moduli of the nanoconfined material, whereas ultrasonic measurements
yield the adiabatic values. Here, we have shown that it is essential
to take the pressure dependence of the heat capacity ratio γ
into account for the conversion between isothermal and adiabatic moduli
of liquids confined in nanopores. The pressure acting in nanopores
is rather high (up to ≈63 MPa for argon in a pore with a diameter
of 2 nm; see Figure 1b), which results in a considerable reduction of γ. Disregarding
this fact would cause a significant overestimation of the adiabatic
modulus of the confined argon (e.g., by ≈20% for dP = 2 nm). For the determination of the pore size from
measurements of the adiabatic modulus, the effect is even greater.
The actual pore size can be overestimated by more than 50%. As a result
of the pressure dependence of the heat capacity ratio, it is also
necessary to know the pore size dependence of the adsorption stress
for the conversion between isothermal and adiabatic moduli. In summary,
for the determination of an average pore size, the experimentalist
needs to know the pore size dependence of both the isothermal modulus
and the adsorption stress as well as the pressure dependence of the
heat capacity ratio. Ideally, simulations could directly supply the
adiabatic values of the elastic moduli, which would supersede the
conversion between isothermal and adiabatic values. However, currently,
such data is not available and a reliable method for the theoretical
prediction of the adiabatic modulus of nanoconfined fluids still has
to be found.

As discussed above, the decrease of γ for
argon with increasing
pressure causes a weaker size dependence of the adiabatic modulus
(in comparison to that of the isothermal modulus). Nevertheless, the
adiabatic modulus also exhibits a linear dependence on the inverse
pore size. (A weaker size dependence of the adsorbate’s modulus
lowers, of course, the resolution of adiabatic measurements used to
determine an average pore diameter.) Even without knowing the actual
pore size dependence of the isothermal modulus for other confined
fluids, we can generalize our observation that the pore size dependence
of the adiabatic modulus is weaker than that for the isothermal modulus
to other fluids, including liquid nitrogen, alkanes, and water. Similar
to argon, these fluids exhibit a decreasing heat capacity ratio with
increasing pressure (of considerably varying strength). The pressure
dependence of the heat capacity ratio for water is rather weak. Thus,
the magnitude of the effect will be minor, if the adsorption stress
for water is of the same order as that for argon.

Besides the
known pressure effects, additional factors (like the
pore size, the structure of the pore surface, and the interaction
strength between the adsorbate and pore surface) could influence the
pressure dependence of the heat capacity ratio in nanoconfinement
as well as the size dependence of K. In this respect,
further theoretical studies (e.g., simulations) and experiments with
other adsorbates and porous materials might give some new insights.
