Being a member of the glycosaminoglycan
family of carbohydrates,
native heparin is a highly sulfated polysaccharide. Herein, heparin
was grafted onto polydopamine (PDA)- and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)-coated
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT).
The immobilized heparin consists of a sulfated repeating disaccharide
unit, conferring a unique microenvironment when catalyzing fructose
dehydration into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The hydrogen bonding
interactions naturally occur between the disaccharide unit of heparin
and the monosaccharide fructose, and the adjacent sulfonic acid groups
catalyze the fructose dehydration. The reactions were performed in
water, and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT achieved an HMF yield of 46.2%
and an HMF selectivity of 82.2%. For the dehydration of fructose in
water, heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT exhibits advantages over published
heterogeneous catalysts on the basis of HMF yield and HMF selectivity.
Three aspects contribute to the environmentally benign processing:
(1) the catalyst heparin is a natural sulfated polysaccharide; (2)
the catalysis is carried out in water and not in organic solvents;
and (3) fructose can be produced from a biomass resource.

==== Body
Introduction
As an important platform
chemical, HMF can be used for production
of monomers and fuels with high heating values.1−4 Catalytic conversion of biomass
resources into HMF has attracted great attention.5−7 Fructose dehydration
into HMF is one of the major steps utilizing biomass resources.8 Fructose dehydration is an acid-catalyzed reaction.9 Compared to homogeneous acids, heterogeneous
solid acid catalysts are more desirable because they are less corrosive,
more ready to separate, and more easily adapted in environmentally
benign processes.10,11

Aside from catalysts, the
reaction media can also influence the
dehydration of fructose into HMF. In organic reaction media, such
as ionic liquids and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a high conversion
and selectivity can be achieved.12,13 The organic
reaction media need to be removed after reaction. However, removing
ionic liquids and DMSO from the reaction systems is extremely difficult
or requires tremendous energy cost due to the fact that they are miscible
with water and not volatile or having a high boiling point. Using
organic reaction media does not meet the demand of sustainable processes.
In contrast, being an environmentally benign solvent, water is more
preferred than organic solvents as the reaction media for fructose
dehydration.

Various heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated
for catalyzing
fructose dehydration in water. A chromium-based heteropoly acid achieved
an HMF yield of 33.4% from fructose dehydration at 130 °C.12 The catalyst Nb-P/SBA-15 exhibited an HMF yield
of 31.2% after reaction at 130 °C for 3 h.14 Catalysts consisting of sulfonic acid groups are capable
of catalyzing fructose dehydration. Functionalized porous organic
hyper-cross-linked polymers were grafted with sulfonic acid groups.
The HMF yield was 9.8% under the catalysis of a sulfonated polymer.15 Polyethylene fibers were grafted with sulfonic
acid groups (HSO3-fiber), achieving an HMF yield of 34%
at 120 °C.16 Silica particles grafted
with a poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) brush were applied for catalytic
conversion of fructose to HMF in water. The particles exhibited a
high activity with the HMF yield up to 31%.10 Sulfonic acid supported on porous solids has shown activity for
the fructose dehydration in neat water.17,18 Unfortunately,
deactivation of catalysts in water was unavoidable because of leaching
of the acid sites.19 Dehydration of fructose
in water requires developing efficient catalysts to overcome the contradiction
between the dehydration reaction and its media of water.

Heparin
is a natural and safe biomaterial, which is a highly sulfated
and anionic glycosaminoglycan consisting of a variably sulfated repeating
disaccharide unit,20 as illustrated in Scheme 1. In this work, heparin
immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was investigated
as a catalyst for fructose dehydration in water. Multiwalled carbon
nanotubes exhibit properties such as good stability, enhanced mechanical
strength, excellent electronic properties, and high specific surface
area.21 MWCNTs were used as the support
of heparin. MWCNTs were first coated with polydopamine (PDA) followed
by wrapping poly(ethylene imine) (PEI). Heparin was then grafted on
PEI@PDA@MWCNT through amidation reaction between the amine groups
of PEI and the carboxyl groups of heparin. The conjugate heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
comprises sulfonic acid groups and repeating disaccharide units, possessing
a unique microenvironment. Fructose, a monosaccharide, can have hydrogen
bonding interactions with the disaccharide units, and the adjacent
sulfonic acid groups catalyze the fructose dehydration.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the Catalyst
Dopamine polymerization
and coating on MWCNTs resulted in a thin layer of polydopamine (PDA)
formed on the surface of MWCNTs, as illustrated in Figure 1b, in contrast to the transmission
electron microscope (TEM) image of purified MWCNTs (Figure 1a). Binding of PEI to PDA@MWCNT
(PEI@PDA@MWCNT) was accomplished by the Schiff base formation reaction
between the primary amine groups of PEI and the catechol groups of
PDA. Figure 1c shows
that a thicker layer was formed after grafting PEI. The surface of
PEI@PDA@MWCNT contains primary amine, secondary amine, and tertiary
amine groups. The carboxyl groups of heparin reacted with the primary
amine groups of PEI@PDA@MWCNT, and heparin was grafted. Figure 1d shows that after grafting
heparin, the surface of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT becomes rough,
and the layer becomes thicker.

and (d) heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.

FTIR and XPS Spectra
Figure 2 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra for the samples. PDA@MWCNT exhibited a relatively increased
intensity of O 1s, and the peak of N 1s appeared, in comparison to
MWCNTs. It is ascribed to the formation of a PDA layer on the MWCNTs.
Compared to PDA@MWCNTs, the intensities of C 1s and N 1s of PEI@PDA@CNT
are relatively increased due to binding PEI. After grafting heparin,
the peak for S 2p appears, ascribed to the sulfonate groups of heparin.
Based on the XPS spectra, the distribution of functional groups was
analyzed, as shown in Figure 3. The C 1s regions were fitted with Lorentzian and Gaussian
lines of variable proportions. The four peaks at 284.6, 285.8, 287.4,
and 290.9 eV were assigned to the binding energies for C–H,
C–N/C–O, C=O/C=N, and π →
π* shakeup satellites,22,23 respectively. PDA@MWCNT
exhibited a wide peak of π → π*, ascribed to the
energy loss feature for aromatic carbon species from PDA. The prominent
peak of C=O/C=N is also ascribed to PDA.22,23 After grafting PEI on PDA@MWCNT, the fraction of the π →
π* peak is decreased, and the intensity of the C–O/C–N
peak is relatively increased due to the amine groups of PEI.24 After grafting heparin on PEI@PDA@MWCNT, the
π → π* peak disappears, and the intensity of the
C–H peak is relatively increased. The S 2p peak of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
is shown with two split peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 centered at 168.1
and 169.2 eV, respectively. The peak area ratio of 2:1 provides evidence
of sulfonic acid groups of heparin.25 The
XPS spectra (Figures 2–4) confirmed the
grafting of heparin on the functionalized MWCNTs.

MWCNT, PDA@MWCNT, PEI@PDA@MWCNT, and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.

Figure 4 S 2p peak of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.

Figure 5 shows
the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for the samples. In the
spectrum of PDA@MWCNT, the peaks at 1576 and 1505 cm–1 were attributed to ring C=C and ring C=N stretching
modes,22,26 respectively, indicating the presence of
aromatic amine species from the PDA layer. Appearance of the peaks
is in accordance with the structure of dopamine. In the spectrum of
PEI@PDA@MWCNT, the absorption peaks at 2944 and 2833 cm–1 were attributed to the aliphatic C–H stretching of the ethylene
group of PEI. The peaks at 1113 and 1051 cm–1 arose
from the stretching vibration of C–N of primary and secondary
amines.27 Appearance of these peaks is
consistent with the chemical structure of PEI. In the spectrum of
heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT, the peaks at 1200 and 1028 cm–1 were assigned to the asymmetric vibration and the symmetric stretching
vibration of the −SO3 groups of heparin,28 confirming the grafting of heparin on PEI@PDA@MWCNT.
An acid–base titration method was used to determine the sulfonic
acid group content of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.29 Heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT (50 mg) was stirred in 10
mL of 2 M NaCl at room temperature for 24 h. Then, 1 mM NaOH solution
was used to titrate the filtrate of NaCl suspension. The sulfonic
acid group content of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT was determined
to be 0.85 ± 0.04 mmol/g. The molecular weight of native heparin
was determined to be 11.4 ± 0.5 kg/mol; thus, the amount of sulfonic
acid groups in native heparin is 5.2 mmol/g. According to the sulfonic
acid group content of heparin, the loading of heparin on heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
is 16.3 wt %.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra for MWCNT, PDA@MWCNT, PEI@PDA@MWCNT, heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT,
and native heparin.

Native heparin consists
of sulfated repeating disaccharide units.
Fructose is a monosaccharide. Hydrogen bonding interactions can occur
between heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT and fructose. To investigate
the types of the hydrogen bond interactions, the infrared spectra
of adsorption at the νOH band from 3000 to 3700 cm–1 were analyzed. The νOH region has
been investigated to effectively identify specific hydrogen bond interactions
within and between molecules.30,31Figure 6 shows the FTIR spectra in the hydroxyl stretching
region from 3700 to 3000 cm–1 for heparin and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
+ fructose. The band at ∼3484 cm–1 is attributed
to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds within heparin. The relative
intensity at ∼3484 cm–1 of heparin (21.5%)
is larger than that of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT + fructose (8.9%).
The band at ∼3415 cm–1 arises from formation
of multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups,
between hydroxyl and glycosidic and ring oxygen, and between hydroxyl
and sulfonic acid groups. The relative intensity at ∼3415 cm–1 of heparin (16.2%) is larger than that of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
+ fructose (12.6%). The band at ∼3350 cm–1 is ascribed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl
groups and between hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups.32−34 The relative intensity at ∼3350 cm–1 of
heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT + fructose (45.5%) is larger than that
of heparin (35.7%). The band at ∼3240 cm–1 is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl
and glycosidic and ring oxygen.35−37 The change of relative intensity
at ∼3240 cm–1 between the two samples is
not significant, heparin (13.0%) and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
+ fructose (14.4%). The band at ∼3175 cm–1 is ascribed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl
and NH.34,37,38 The NH comes
from both heparin and PEI. The relative intensity at ∼3175
cm–1 of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT + fructose
(18.6%) is larger than that of heparin (13.6%). Analysis of the FTIR
spectra indicates that upon adding fructose to the solution of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT,
the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within heparin decreased,
and that for the multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds also decreased.
That for the intermolecular hydrogen bonds increased due to the hydrogen
bonding interactions between heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT and fructose.
The FTIR spectra in Figure 6 confirmed the hydrogen bonding interaction between fructose
and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.

(a) heparin and (b) heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT + fructose.

The dispersibility of purified MWCNTs, PEI@PDA@MWCNT,
and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV 2550). The
higher UV–vis absorbance, the larger the dispersibility of
the sample in water is. Figure 7 shows the UV–vis spectra for the samples. After grafting
heparin, the conjugate heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT exhibited the
highest dispersibility in water compared to other samples due to the
sulfated repeating disaccharide unit of heparin. This is favorable
for the interaction of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT with fructose.

Catalytic Activity
Figure 8 illustrates the fructose dehydration
under
the catalysis of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT at different temperatures
in water. With increasing temperature, the fructose conversion increased.
At 140 °C, the HMF selectivity was the highest one (88.3%), the
corresponding fructose conversion was 43%, indicating that the side
reactions were significantly suppressed. At 160 °C, the conversion
of fructose and the selectivity of HMF were 56.2 and 82.2%, respectively.
Considering the conversion of fructose and the selectivity of HMF,
the temperature 160 °C was determined as the appropriate temperature.

Figure 8 Fructose
dehydration under the catalysis of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
in water at different temperatures. The weight ratio of fructose to
catalyst was 4.0. The fructose dehydration was performed for 3 h.

Figure 9 shows the
conversion of fructose and the selectivity of HMF as a function of
reaction time. The highest HMF yield of 46.2% was achieved after 3
h of reaction. As the reaction time was prolonged, the yield of HMF
decreased due to the formation of byproducts. The weight ratio of
fructose to the conjugate was 4, which is equivalent to the weight
ratio of fructose to heparin of 24.7. When using native heparin as
the catalyst with a weight ratio of fructose to heparin of 24.7, native
heparin achieved the yield and selectivity of HMF being 47.4 and 82.6%,
respectively. Under the same reaction condition, the HMF conversion
was not observed under the catalysis of PEI@PDA@MWCNT. It has been
confirmed that the catalytic activity of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
comes from the heparin of the conjugate heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT.
The formed humin impurities are insoluble in water. The soluble portion,
containing HMF and unreacted fructose, was recovered by filtration
and washed with water. Using hexane/EtOAc (1:1) as the mobile phase,
HMF was purified with flash column chromatography.

Figure 9 Fructose conversion,
HMF yield, and lactic acid yields under the
catalysis of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT in water. The weight ratio
of fructose to catalyst was 4.0. The fructose dehydration was performed
at 160 °C.

For the stability test, native
heparin was incubated in aqueous
solution at reaction conditions (160 °C for 3 h). Then, heparin
was precipitated from the solution with ethanol. The FTIR spectrum
of the recovered heparin shows peaks at 1200 and 1025 cm–1 (Figure S1), which were assigned to the
asymmetric vibration and the symmetric stretching vibration of the
−SO3 groups of heparin. The peaks at 1720 cm–1 were assigned to the absorption of carboxyl groups
of heparin. The molecular weights of native heparin and recovered
heparin were measured to be 11.4 ± 0.5 and 11.2 ± 0.4 kg/mol,
respectively. The molecular weight distributions of native heparin
and recovered heparin were narrow with polydispersities of 1.20 and
1.22, respectively. These results confirm the stability of heparin
under the reaction condition.

Heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT was
reused to test its stability.
Heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT exhibited negligible loss in activity
after five cycles of reuse, as shown in Figure 10. EDS spectra of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
after reuse were measured. Figure S2 shows
that the intensity of elements for the fresh catalyst and the catalyst
recycled was almost the same, indicating that heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
did not change after the reuse.

Figure 10 Consecutive test of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
for fructose conversion
into HMF in water. The consecutive test was performed at 160 °C
for 3 h. The catalyst after run was recovered by filtration, washed
with ethanol and water thoroughly, and then vacuum dried at 60 °C
for 12 h.

Various heterogeneous catalysts
had been investigated in organic
solvents such as isopropanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).39−41 Herein, these organic solvents were used in the fructose dehydration
under the catalysis of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT. DMSO is a versatile
solvent. Fructose can be dissolved in DMSO, and the conjugate heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
can be dispersed well in DMSO. Thus, the hydrogen bonding interactions
between fructose and heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT occurred naturally,
promoting the contact of fructose with the catalyst. The generated
water arising from the dehydration is miscible with DMSO, reducing
the inhibition effect of water. In addition, DMSO can inhibit the
side reactions that often occurred when using water as the reaction
media. Attributed to the above reasons, the fructose dehydration in
DMSO with heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT had excellent fructose conversion
and selectivity (Table 1). However, DMSO has a high boiling point and is difficult to remove
from the system afterward. In other organic solvents such as DMF and
isopropanol, fructose has a lower solubility,42 making them not favorable for the interaction of fructose with heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
through the hydrogen bonding interactions. Possibly, this is the reason
why the fructose conversion and selectivity in the organic solvents
are lower than those in water. Researchers have always paid much attention
to fructose dehydration in water. Table 2 lists the published results of fructose
dehydration in water under various heterogeneous catalysts. Compared
to the published heterogeneous catalysts, heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
exhibited advantages in terms of yield and selectivity of HMF.

Conclusions
Native
heparin was grafted onto PEI- and PDA-functionalized multiwalled
carbon nanotubes and used for catalyzing the fructose dehydration
into HFM in water. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes exhibit properties
such as good stability, excellent electronic properties, enhanced
mechanical strength, and high specific surface area. The synthesis
of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT utilized four different raw materials.
Polydopamine (PDA) has a strong adhesion coating on various surfaces.
In situ formation of polydopamine on the MWCNTs confers a solid basis
for further grafting poly(ethylene imine) (PEI). The amino groups
of PEI were the functional groups to react with the carboxyl groups
of heparin for grafting heparin. Heparin possesses a sulfated repeating
disaccharide unit, conferring a unique microenvironment for the hydrogen
bonding interactions and subsequent fructose dehydration. It has been
demonstrated that heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT achieved a high HMF
yield and selectivity in water, in comparison to published heterogeneous
catalysts. The conjugate can be recycled to catalyze the fructose
dehydration. Using heparin as the catalyst for fructose dehydration
in water meets the demand of sustainable development.

Methodology
General
Information
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
were obtained from Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). Other
chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd. The chemical reagents were used without further purification.

Polydopamine Coating of MWCNTs (PDA@MWCNT)
MWCNTs were
purified in 3 M HNO3 for 12 h, then recovered by filtering
with a polycarbonate membrane, and then washed with deionized water.57 The samples were vacuum-dried at 60 °C.
The purified MWCNTs (100 mg) were dispersed in water/ethanol (40 mL/50
mL) after sonication for 15 min. Then, dopamine (400 mg) and Tris
buffer (100 mL, pH 8.5) were added. The solution was stirred at room
temperature for 1 day. The polydopamine-coated MWCNTs (PDA@MWCNT)
were collected by filtering through a polycarbonate membrane and washed
with deionized water and ethanol. Then, the conjugate was dried under
vacuum at 60 °C overnight.

Poly(ethylene imine) Coating
of PDA@MWCNT (PEI@PDA@MWCNT)
PDA@MWCNT (50 mg) was added
to 25 mL of the PEI aqueous solution
(2.0 mg/mL) and sonicated for 15 min. Then, the conjugate PEI@PDA@MWCNT
was recovered by filtering through a polycarbonate membrane, washed
with deionized water, and then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for
12 h.

Grafting of Heparin on PEI@PDA@MWCNT (Heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT)
Heparin was grafted on PEI@PDA@MWCNT through the reaction between
the amino groups of PEI and the carboxyl groups of heparin. Briefly,
heparin sodium (200 mg) was dispersed in 2-(N-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (20 mL, pH 6.2) under sonication.
Then, 0.12 g of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 0.38
g of N-ethyl-N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) were added to the mixture separately.
The resulting mixture was then sonicated for 10 min. The solution
of activated heparin (10 mg/mL) was added to the suspension of PEI@PDA@MWCNT
(4 mg/mL, 15 mL). The mixture was then shaken (130 rpm) at 25 °C
for 8 h. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000g for 15 min, and the precipitate was washed with deionized water
five times to remove heparin that was not grafted. Finally, heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
was obtained after drying under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h.

Characterization
and Measurement
Thermo VG ESCALAB250
was used to measure XPS spectra of the samples. The measurement was
performed at a pressure of 2 × 10–9 Pa with
Mg Kα X-rays as the excitation source. FTIR spectra of the samples
were measured with a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with a resolution
of 2 cm–1. The molecular weight and molecular weight
distribution of heparin were estimated by size exclusion chromatography
using a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with a multiangle light-scattering
detector.

Dehydration of Fructose to HMF
Fructose (0.1 g) was
dissolved in 10 mL of water, and then 25 mg of heparin–PEI@PDA@MWCNT
was added to the solution. The air inside the reactor was purged with
Ar, and the pressure was kept at 0.4 MPa to prevent boiling. After
reacting for a certain time at a desirable temperature, samples were
taken out. Insoluble particulates were removed from the samples via
centrifugation. A portion of samples was taken for analysis.

The samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography
(Shimadzu LC-10A). Fructose, levulinic acid, and formic acid were
detected using a refractive index detector with an Aminex HPX 87H
ion exclusion column. H2SO4 (5 mM) flowing at
0.6 mL/min was used as the mobile phase. The yield of HMF was measured
using a UV–vis detector with a Diamonsil C18 column. Methanol/water
(70:30 (v/v)) flowing at 1.0 mL/min was used as the mobile phase.
Each reaction was carried out at least three times. The error bars
shown in the figures reflect the differences between runs.
