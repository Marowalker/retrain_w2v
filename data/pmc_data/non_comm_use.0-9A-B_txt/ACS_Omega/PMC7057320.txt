Magnetic
properties of fully oxygenated bare CuO nanoparticles
have been investigated using magnetization, X-ray diffraction, neutron
diffraction, and Raman scattering measurements. The Langevin field
profile is clearly revealed in the isothermal magnetization of 8.8
nm CuO nanoparticle assembly even at 300 K, revealing a 172 times
enhancement of the ferromagnetic responses over that of bulk CuO.
Surface magnetization of 8.8 nm CuO reaches 18% of the core magnetization.
The Cu spins in 8.8 nm CuO order below 400 K, which is 1.7 times higher
than the 231 K observed in bulk CuO. A relatively simple magnetic
structure that may be indexed using a modulation vector of (0.2, 0,
0.2) was found for the 8.8 nm CuO, but no magnetic incommensurability
was observed in bulk CuO. The Cu spins in 8.8 nm CuO form spin density
waves with length scales of 5 chemical unit cells long along the crystallographic a- and c-axis directions. Considerable
amounts of electronic charge shift from around the Cu lattice sites
toward the interconnecting regions of two neighboring Cu–Cu
ions, resulting in a stronger ferromagnetic direct exchange interaction
for the neighboring Cu spins in 8.8 nm CuO.

1 Introduction
Fully
oxygenated cupric oxide CuO has been characterized as a semiconducting
material,1−3 exhibiting great potential for broad applications
in photoelectron materials,4 gas sensors,5 lithium-ion electrode materials,6 field emission emitters,7,8 and heterogeneous
catalysts.9 CuO crystallizes into a monoclinic
structure with a spatial symmetry belonging to the space group C2/c.10,11 There are
four formula units in a unit cell, with a crystalline structure that
can be viewed as consisting of interconnected zigzag Cu–O–Cu–O
chains along the [101] crystallographic direction (Figure 1). Each Cu ion is coordinated
by four O ions, forming distorted side-sharing CuO4 tetrahedrons.
The magnetic interaction between the Cu2+ ions is mainly
mediated through the neighboring O2– ions, with
a superexchange strength that depends on the Cu–O–Cu
bond angle. The distorted side-sharing CuO4 tetrahedrons
give rise to four different Cu–O–Cu bond angles ranging
from 95 to 145° for the Cu–O networks. A complex magnetic
structure for the Cu spins can then be anticipated. Neutron diffraction
measurements reveal an incommensurate (ICM) antiferromagnetic order
for the Cu spins at TN1 = 231 K,10,12,13 with a magnetic modulation vector
that has been suggested to be dependent on the oxygen deficiency.13 Through a first-order transition at TN2 = 212.5 K, the Cu spins reorient into a commensurate
(CM) antiferromagnetic arrangement, with the moments aligned along
the b-axis direction.12,13 Inelastic
neutron scattering measurements reveal a large spin-wave velocity,
showing a strong superexchange interaction for the Cu spins in CuO.13

where the
dashed lines indicate the boundaries of nuclear unit cells and the
small red and large gray balls indicate the Cu and O ions, respectively.
There are 4 CuO units in a nuclear unit cell. The atomic arrangement
of CuO can be viewed as consisting of interconnected zigzag Cu–O–Cu–O
chains extending along the [101] crystallographic direction.

There are at least two effects that may alter the
number of uncompensated
spins, hence the magnetic properties, when the size is reduced to
the nanometer scale: first, transfer of the outer electrons of surface
atoms to the inner core, which has been demonstrated14,15 to be energetically favorable to stabilizing the core; second, the
increase of imbalanced spins from the increase of Fermi holes from
the image charges of surface electrons.16−18 Magnetization measurements
performed on CuO nanoparticles (NPs), fabricated using sol–gel
routes, reveal weak ferromagnetic signals that persist up to 330 K
in 6.6 nm CuO, which were suggested to be originated from the uncompensated
surface Cu2+ spins.19,20 On the other hand,
the ferromagnetic responses that persist up to 300 K observed in 14–28
nm CuO NPs fabricated by sol–gel routes were attributed to
the appearance of surface oxygen vacancies.21 A giant negative thermal expansion of the crystalline lattice has
also been found below a magnetic ordering temperature of 300 K in
5 nm CuO, indicating the existence of strong spin–lattice couplings
in CuO NPs.22

There are many ways
to fabricate NPs. Chemical reduction processes,
such as sol–gel routes, are frequently used, but the resultant
NPs are unavoidably capped by the molecules used as reduction agents.
The physical properties obtained on surfactant-capped NPs are complicated
by the interactions between the NPs and capping molecules, but not
reflect those of NPs themselves. In this article, we report the results
of studies made on the magnetic properties of capping-free fully oxygenated
CuO NPs, with an emphasis on the changes in properties originating
from the reduction of particle size but avoiding the complications
that may arise from the capping agents. The CuO NP assemblies are
fabricated using the gas condensation method.23 The ferromagnetic (FM) component of the Cu spins is greatly enhanced
in nanosized CuO. A saturation FM magnetization of 8.8 nm CuO reaches
172 times that of bulk CuO, and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnetization
increases by a factor of 9. Surface magnetization is visible below
10 K and reaches 18% of the core magnetization. The ordering temperature
of the Cu spins in 8.8 nm CuO shifts to 400 K, while the spin reorientation
appears at 280 K. No magnetic incommensurability but a relatively
simple spin density wave arrangement was observed. Considerable amounts
of electronic charge appear in the interconnecting regions of two
neighboring Cu ions in nanosized CuO. The differences in the electron
density distributions between nanosized and bulk CuO are used to understand
our observations.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystalline Structure
Neutron and
X-ray diffractions were used to determine the crystalline structure
and chemical composition of the CuO NP assemblies. The General Structure
Analysis System (GSAS) program,24 following
the Rietveld profile refining method, was used to analyze diffraction
patterns. Line profiles of the X-ray diffraction peaks were used to
extract mean sizes and size distributions of the NP assemblies. The
neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns of all three sets of CuO NP
assemblies can be associated with a monoclinic structure. Neutron
diffraction is sensitive to the O atom in CuO as the scattering length b of neutron to O is comparable to that of Cu (b = 5.805 fm for O and 7.718 fm for Cu). Neutron diffraction patterns
were hence used to determine the O content in the samples. Figure 2a shows the observed
(crosses) and fitted (solid lines) neutron diffraction patterns of
the representative CuO NP assembly (fabricated using a chamber pressure
of 2 torr) at 400 K, revealing that the O sites are fully occupied.
It appears that O site occupancy contributes most pronouncedly to
the (111) and (002) + (111̅) neutron diffraction intensities.
Refinement analysis assuming a 10% oxygen deficiency generates a fit
that fails to satisfactory account for the intensities observed for
(110) and (002) + (111̅) reflections [accounting for 83% of
the (110) intensity and 109% of the (002) + (111̅) intensity],
whereas a full oxygen occupancy accounts for 96% of the (110) intensity
and 98% of the (002) + (111̅) intensity. Details of the results
of these analyses can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). All four samples are fully oxygenated
as the O sites are essentially fully occupied (Table 1). No diffraction peaks other than from the
monoclinic CuO can be identified from the diffraction patterns (Figure 2a and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) in which
any impurity phase would be less than 3% of the CuO component. If
any capping molecules do appear on the CuO NPs, it would be less than
3%. It appears that widths of the diffraction peaks are much broader
than the instrumental resolution, reflecting broadening of the peak
profiles from the finite-size effect. The mean particle diameters
are determined by fitting the X-ray diffraction peaks, where the angular
resolution is better, to the diffraction profiles of finite-sized
particles.23 The solid curves in Figure 2b indicate the calculated
pattern assuming a log-normal size distribution (inset to Figure 2b) with a center
at 8.8 nm and a standard deviation width of 0.3 for the sample fabricated
using a chamber pressure of 2 torr. A ∼6% of impurity phase
will appear if there is a single layer of other atoms that are attached
on the surface of the 8.8 nm CuO NP, which would be detected in the
neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns. The fabrication parameters
and refined structural parameters for the four samples at 300 K are
listed in Table 1.
Interestingly, there is a progressive decrease in the bond valences
of Cu with a reduction in the particle size (Table 1), showing that the Cu ions provide less
electronic charges toward the O sites for the ionic bonding in smaller
particles.

nanoparticle assembly observed (crosses) at 400 K. The solid lines

differences between the observed and fitted patterns are plotted at

2.2 Enhanced Magnetization
The isothermal
magnetic-field profiles of the magnetization M(Ha), taken in a field-increasing loop, of the
three NP assemblies and 2 mm ingots at 1.8 K are shown together in Figure 3a for a direct comparison
where the 2 mm CuO ingots are used to represent bulk CuO. The most
pronounced feature seen is the extremely large increase of M in the NPs. Two magnetic components are clearly revealed
in all three CuO NP assemblies, even in the 2 mm ingots (Figure 3b). In the low-Ha regime, M increases rapidly
with increasing Ha, becoming saturated
at Ha ∼ 1 kOe. This component may
be satisfactorily described by a Langevin profile L(α) = coth(α) – (1/α), where α ≡
μpHa/kBT (μp is the average
particle magnetic moment, Ha is the applied
magnetic field, and kB is Boltzmann’s
constant). The Langevin profile for M(Ha) reflects the alignment of magnetic moments on CuO NPs
by Ha. It signifies the existence of FM
spin correlations in CuO NPs. This FM component can be expressed in
terms of the saturation FM magnetization M0 as MFM = M0L(α). In the high-Ha regime, M increases linearly with Ha, reflecting the existence of an AFM component, which
can be expressed in terms of the AFM magnetic susceptibility χAFM as MAFM = χAFMHa. The solid curves in Figure 3a,b are the result of the fitting
of the data to M(Ha)
= M0L(α) + χAFMHa, with M0, μp, and χAFM being the
fitting parameters. M0, μp, and χAFM obtained from the fits for the four CuO
assemblies at 1.8 K are listed in Table 2.

the 8.8 (open squares), 25 (filled stars), and 50 nm (open circles)
CuO nanoparticle assemblies together with that of 2 mm (open triangles)
CuO spheres at 1.8 K. The solid curve indicates the results of fits
of the M(Ha) curves to
a Langevin plus a linear profile. (b) M(Ha) curve of 2 mm CuO spheres at 1.8 K plotted using an

It is remarkable to find that the M0 of 8.8 nm CuO at 1.8 K reaches 4.3 × 10–2 emu/g, which is a factor of 172 times higher than the M0 of the 2 mm ingot (Table 2). This extremely large increase of M0 cannot
simply be a result of the increases in the surface moment expected
for nanosized particles, but instead, it must be a result of a change
of spin arrangement. A large enhancement (108 times) of M0 is also found for the 25 nm CuO but a considerably smaller
enhancement (2.3 times) for the 50 nm CuO (Table 2), showing that a major change in the Cu
spin arrangement will occur in particles smaller than 50 nm. In addition,
the χAFM of the 8.8 nm CuO is a factor of 9 times
larger than that of the 2 mm CuO (Table 2). The large increases in both the FM and
AFM magnetizations cannot solely be a result of the spin rearrangement
but are indicative of an increase in the magnetic moment of the Cu
ions in CuO NPs. Room-temperature ferromagnetism has also been observed
in flowerlike CuO nanostructures with oxygen vacancies, prepared by
the coprecipitation method and postannealing, but with the ferromagnetism
decreasing after annealing in an oxygen atmosphere.25 Reduction of Neel temperature to 221 K in 11 nm CuO, prepared
by thermal decomposition of the carbonate precursor, has recently
been reported and is attributed to the presence of O2– vacancies.26 The present observations
of largely enhanced magnetism were from fully oxygenated CuO NPs.
Clearly, the particle size and oxygen content of CuO play essential
roles in the magnetism of CuO.

2.3 Surface
and Core Magnetizations
M(Ha) taken at temperatures
of up to 300 K can all be satisfactorily described by a Langevin plus
a linear Ha dependency (Figure 4a). The thermal profile of
the M0 of the 8.8 nm CuO displays a sharp
turn at 10 K (Figure 4b). The large difference in the thermal reduction rates of M0 below and above 10 K shows that they are linked to different
origins. 11% of the atoms in the 8.8 nm CuO are located on the surface.
It can be expected that the magnetic moments developed on the surface
of an NP are different from those developed in the core, and their
thermal characteristics can be noticeably different. The sharp turn
at 10 K separates the effects mainly resulting from the surface moments
at low temperatures and from the core moments at high temperatures.
The thermal profile of the surface magnetization can be expressed
in terms of surface spin freezing temperature Tf as MS ∝ exp.(−T/Tf).27,28 On the other hand, the thermal agitation of the core spins can be
described by a power law of M0 ∝
[1 – (T/TC)b], where TC is the
transition temperature and the exponent b links to
the type of spin ordering.29 Accounting
for the contributions from both surface and core spins, the saturation
magnetization can be expressed as, where MC is
the saturation magnetization of the core moment at zero temperature
and α specifies the ratio between the surface and core moments
at zero temperature. The solid curve in Figure 4a indicates the results of fitting of M0(T) to the above expression,
giving MC = 4.31(1) × 10–2 emu/g, α = 0.18, Tf = 2.9(3) K,
and b = 2.1(2). The value of b =
2.1 obtained for the 8.8 nm CuO is significantly larger than the b = 3/2 expected for creations of thermal magnons in bulk
ferromagnets29 but reflecting the b = 2 expected for finite-size ferromagnetic clusters based
on a mean field calculation.30 The α
= 0.18 obtained from the fits shows that the surface moment is 18%
of the core moment in 8.8 nm CuO at a temperature without thermal
excitation. The Lenz diamagnetic responses are not visible in M(Ha) but are covered by the
strong AFM signals even at 300 K. The values for χAFM deduced from the fits to M(Ha) do not represent the AFM susceptibility but include the
inseparable AFM and Lenz susceptibilities.

the 8.8 nm CuO nanoparticle assembly, taken in field-increasing loops

results of fits of M(Ha) to a Langevin plus a linear profile. Langevin component for the
existence of spontaneous magnetization is seen even at 300 K. (b)

thermal reduction rate around 10 K. The solid curves indicate the
results of fits to the expression listed in the plot.

2.4 Electronic Charge Redistribution
X-ray diffraction patterns of the 8.8 nm NPs and 2 mm ingots at 77
K were also taken for extraction of electronic charge density (ECD).
The ECD maps were obtained by employing the GSAS program, by the calculations
of the inverse Fourier transforms of the structure factors, after
profile refinements of the X-ray diffraction patterns. The electron
density contour map of a specific lattice plane is then obtained by
slicing the electron density including 0.025 Å below and above
the plane. The changes in the electronic charge distribution are then
identified by taking the difference in the ECD plots where the ECD
distribution of the 2 mm CuO is subtracted from that of the 8.8 nm
CuO. Such difference ECD plots for the Cu sites at (0, 0, 0), the
O sites at (0, 0, 0.25), and a representative intermediate region
at (0, 0, 0.34) are illustrated in Figure 5. In these plots, the atomic positions with
negative values (blue to green) represent the locations where the
electronic charges are less in 8.8 nm CuO, which have been redistributed
to the positions with positive values (yellow to red).

Figure 5 (a) Atom arrangement
of monoclinic CuO. The colored planes indicate
the positions in the crystallographic c-axis direction
where the electronic charge density is plotted. (b–d) Difference
of the electronic charge density between the 8.8 nm CuO assembly and
2 mm Cu spheres on the (b) z = 0, (c) z = 0.25, and (d) z = 0.34 lattice planes. The regions
marked in yellow-to-red indicate the positions having a positive difference
charge density, where the charge density of the 8.8 nm CuO nanoparticles
is higher than that of the 2 mm spheres. The regions marked in green-to-blue
indicate the positions having a negative difference charge density,
where the charge density of the 8.8 nm CuO nanoparticles is lower
than that of the 2 mm spheres. The color bars are in units of e/Å3.

Considerably less electronic charges
(up to −6 e/Å3) in 8.8 nm CuO are distributed
at and near the Cu lattice
sites at (0.25, 0.25, 0) but appear in the interconnecting regions
of neighboring ions, as a consequence of an outgoing shift of electrons
from near the lattice sites to the interconnecting regions (Figure 5b). There is a significant
increase in the number of electronic charges in most of the regions
between the two neighboring Cu ions along the [−110] crystallographic
direction, while the electronic charges decrease along the [110] direction
(Figure 5b). The FM
direct exchange interaction between two neighboring Cu ions along
the [−110] direction appears to be greatly enhanced by the
significant increase in the number of electrons in between. In addition,
there is even a larger shift in electrons (up to −6 e/Å3) from the O lattice sites at (0, 0.411, 0.25) to the interconnecting
regions (Figure 5c).
It can be seen that the regions with negative values (blue to green
in Figure 5c) in the
difference ECD map extend about one-third toward the middle point
between the two nearest neighbors along the [110] direction but extend
further, to reach two-thirds along the [−110] direction. It
is clear that the distribution of not only the outer electrons but
also the inner electrons has been extended toward the interconnecting
regions in the 8.8 nm CuO. As we approach the interlayer regions,
it is interesting to see that additional electronic charges appear
more in the interconnecting regions between the Cu and O ions along
the [−110] direction (Figure 5d). Figure 6 displays the contours in a 3D view for a difference ECD of
+2.5 e/Å3, showing that more electronic charges shift
toward the interconnecting regions between two neighboring Cu–Cu
ions than toward that of Cu–O ions, establishing a better electronic
connection for the neighboring Cu–Cu ions. Apparently, the
change in the spatial distribution of the electronic charge from the
reduction of CuO into 8.8 nm does not extend isotopically in all crystallographic
directions, but rather some portion of the electrons shift from specific
regions to others. The redistribution involves not only spherically
distributed s electrons (4s in Cu and 2s in O) but also includes directional
3d electrons in Cu and 2p electrons in O.

of +2.5 e/Å3 for the difference
of electronic charge density between 8.8 nm and bulk CuO, revealing
the shifts of electronic charges toward to interconnecting regions
between two neighboring Cu–Cu ions.

2.5 Spin Arrangements
Neutron diffraction
patterns taken at low temperatures were collected to identify the
diffractions from the magnetic correlation. Several new diffraction
peaks developed with intensities increasing upon cooling to below
400 K, showing the ordering of the Cu spins (Figure 7). This reflection can be associated with
a magnetic modulation vector of q = (0.2, 0, 0.2)
showing the magnetic unit cell 5 times the nuclear one along the crystallographic a- and c-axis directions. Order parameter
measurements reveal a change in the rate of intensity variation at
280 K for the (200) + q reflection (Figure 8a), showing the appearance
of a transition at TN2 = 280 K in addition
to the Cu spin ordering temperature of TN1 = 400 K. Additional intensities from magnetic ordering also appear
at the nuclear peak positions, only to reveal downturns in intensity
upon cooling below 280 K (Figure 8b,c). No new diffraction peaks were detected, but there
was a shift of intensity among the peaks upon cooling below 280 K,
revealing the characteristic behavior of the occurrence of spin reorientation
at TN2 without a change in spin structure.
The TN1 = 400 K for the Cu spins in the
8.8 nm CuO is 1.73 times higher than the 231 K found13 in a bulk single crystal, showing a much stronger magnetic
coupling strength for the Cu spins in 8.8 nm CuO. The magnetic structure
can be described with a magnetic modulation vector of (0.2, 0, 0.2),
which differs greatly from the (1/201/2) + (0.006, 0, −0.017)12 or (1/201/2) + (0.0125,
0, 0.0125)13 observed in a single crystal.
Spin reorientation, rather than changes in the magnetic modulation
vector, occurs at TN2 for the Cu spins
in 8.8 nm CuO. Figure 9 shows the observed (crosses) and calculated (solid lines) neutron
diffraction patterns at 6 K, assuming the C2/c symmetry for the monoclinic crystalline structure plus
a magnetic structure with a modulation vector of (0.2, 0, 0.2) for
the Cu ions. They agree reasonably well. The proposed spin structure
in the crystallographic a–c planes may be viewed as consisting of a ferromagnetically coupled
double-chain spin density wave with a spatial periodicity of 5 nuclear
unit cells along the crystallographic a-axis direction
and a phase shift of 72° between the neighboring double-chain
along the c-axis direction (Figure 10) and a ferromagnetic coupling for the Cu
spins along the crystallographic b-axis direction.
The moments lie along the crystallographic c-axis
direction, with an amplitude of 0.78(3) μB.

3 Conclusions
The
present study focuses on identifying the effects of spatial
restriction on the magnetic properties of CuO. Ferromagnetic responses
of 25 nm CuO NPs are ∼100 times stronger than that of 2 mm
ingots. It is unlikely that the enhancement is from the surface effect
since there are only 4% of the atoms in 25 nm CuO located on the surface.
The disruption of lattice periodicity at the particle surface, known
as small size effect, must have played a role. Ferromagnetic responses,
surface magnetization, Cu spin ordering temperature, and Cu spin arrangement
are all largely enhanced in 8.8 nm CuO. The present studies show that
the enhancements are mainly caused by charge redistribution triggered
by the disruption of lattice periodicity at the surface. Charge redistribution
that occurs in the Cu ions must involve both the 4s and 3d electrons
for the largely enhanced ferromagnetic responses, reflecting that
the 4s and 3d bands of the Cu ions in 8.8 nm CuO are energetically
close to each other. An extended 3d and 4s band mixture can then be
anticipated to generate the observed anisotropic electronic charge
redistribution. The formation of the ferromagnetic double-chain spin
density wave for the Cu spins is due to the fact that there are more
electronic charges in the interconnecting regions of two neighboring
Cu ions and there are less electronic changes in the interconnecting
regions of the neighboring Cu and O ions. The former enhances the
ferromagnetic direct exchange interaction between Cu–Cu ions,
whereas the latter weakens the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction
between Cu–Cu ions mediated by the neighboring O ions. It is
the formation of ferromagnetically coupled spin density layers that
gives rise to largely enhanced ferromagnetic responses in the 8.8
nm CuO.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Sample
Fabrication
The CuO NPs used
in the present study were generated by the annealing of Cu NPs at
323 K in an oxygen atmosphere for 48 h, which progressively transforms
the dark-black Cu NPs into dark-green Cu2O NPs and finally
into dark-brown CuO NPs. Three sets of Cu NPs were fabricated by employing
the gas condensation method,23 with the
mean particle size and size distribution controlled by the appropriate
choice of chamber pressure and source temperature. High-purity Cu
spheres (0.5 g, 99.99% pure, ∼2 mm in diameter) were heated
by a current source of 55 A and were evaporated at a rate of 0.05
Å/s in an Ar atmosphere at the selected pressure (0.05 or 1.2
or 2 torr). A nonmagnetic SS316 stainless steel plate, placed 20 cm
above the evaporation source and maintained at 77 K, was used to collect
the evaporated particles. The NPs, which were only loosely attached
to the collector, were stripped off after the chamber was restored
to room temperature. The samples thus fabricated were in powder form,
consisting of macroscopic amounts of individual Cu NPs. X-ray diffraction
patterns of the samples thus fabricated reveal a face-centered cubic
structure of Cu (Figures S3–S5 in
the Supporting Information). No traces of oxidation phases or components
other than Cu can be identified from the diffraction patterns. There
was no substrate or capping molecules on the Cu NPs.

4.2 Instrumentation
The X-ray diffraction
measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer
(Bruker Corporation, USA), employing the standard reflection geometry,
with an emission current of 40 mA and an acceleration voltage of 40
kV for the source. The neutron diffraction measurements were conducted
at the Bragg Institute, ANSTO, Australia, using the high-intensity
powder diffractometer Wombat, employing an incident wavelength of
λ = 2.415 Å defined by Ge (113) crystals. For these measurements,
∼1 g of the sample was loaded into a cylindrical vanadium can,
which gave rise to no measureable neutron diffraction peak. The sample
temperature was controlled using a He gas refrigerator system. The
magnetization measurements were performed on a Physical Property Measurement
System (PPMS), manufactured by Quantum Design, employing the standard
setups. The magnetization M was measured by detecting
the induced voltage in the detector coils as the sample moved through
them. For these measurements, ∼40 mg of the sample was loosely
packed into a thin nonmagnetic cylindrical holder. The holder produced
a smooth temperature curve and a background signal that was ∼2%
of the signal from the sample. The powdered sample was shaken at 50
Hz for 10 min using a Vortex-Genie mixer to avoid aggregation among
the nanoparticles. The mass density was 6% of the bulk density so
that the interparticle interaction would be insignificant, mainly
revealing the magnetic responses of individual NPs without significant
contributions from interparticle interactions. Raman scattering measurements
were performed on a Shamrock SR-500i-A (Andor, U.K.), equipped with
a double grating of 1200 line/mm each, and a Newton DU940 CCD detector.
The Raman spectra were excited using a 514 nm excitation line at 150
mW, with a CCD signal integration time of 90 s.
