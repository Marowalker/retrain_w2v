The
transition of amyloidogenic species into ordered structures
(i.e., prefibrillar oligomers, protofibrils, mature fibrils, and amyloidogenic
aggregates) is closely associated with many neurodegenerative disease
pathologies. It is increasingly appreciated that the liquid–solid
interface contributes to peptide aggregation under physiological conditions.
However, much remains to be explored on the molecular mechanism of
surface-directed amyloid formation. We herein demonstrate that physical
environmental conditions (i.e., negatively charged surface) affect
amyloid formation. Nontoxic amyloid aggregates quickly develop into
intertwisting fibrils on a negatively charged mica surface. These
fibrillar structures show significant cytotoxicity on both neuroblastoma
cell-lines (SH-SY5Y) and primary neural stem cells. Our results suggest
an alternative amyloid development pathway, following which Aβ
peptides form large amyloidogenic aggregates upon stimulation, and
later transit into neurotoxic fibrillar structures while being trapped
and aligned by a negatively charged surface. Conceivably, the interplay
between chemical and physical environmental conditions plays important
roles in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

==== Body
Introduction
Among many, the most
characteristic pathological feature of neurodegenerative
diseases is the formation of amyloidogenic species originating from
protein misfolding.1−22 Despite the biological and clinical significance, the underlying
mechanisms of amyloid formation in vivo and its correlation with pathophysiological
symptoms remain unclear. Numerous factors including elevated temperature,
shearing force, low pH, salt concentration, liquid–substrate
interfaces, and hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces were reported
to contribute to amyloid formation.23−32 Moreover, the origin of cytotoxicity during amyloid development
in vivo is still on debate. The belief in the cytotoxicity of both
fibril (protofibrils or mature fibrils) and intermediate oligomeric
amyloidogenic species is challenged.33−44

Increasing evidence indicates that complex physical and chemical
environmental conditions (i.e., fluctuating levels of secretases,
ligands, and mechanical cues) affect cell fate. It is conceivable
that pathophysiological symptoms may be caused by interplay among
varieties of contributors. Our earlier study reveal that both the
secretion of the proinflammatory factor S100A9 and micelles originating
from fatty acids trigger the formation of large amyloid aggregates,
which may act as a sink for toxic species to mediate neuron damage.45,46 The presence of solid–liquid interface substrates provides
templates for the misfolding and ordering of amyloidogenic proteins
into fibrils, and eventually plaques.47,48 However, how
physical environments facilitate the transition from large amyloid
aggregates to ordered structures and affect the neuron system is not
yet understood.47,49

Hen egg white lysozyme
(HEWL) is highly homologous in sequence
and structure to human lysozyme; therefore, it is commonly used as
a model protein for the investigation of amyloid aggregation.50,51 Accumulated Aβ peptides are the main component of senile plaques
and are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a larger glycoprotein
named amyloid precursor protein.52,53 In this study,
HEWL and Aβ(1–40) amyloid aggregates were formed by agitation
(continuous shaking), and later deposited on a freshly cleaved mica
surface for further development. The effect of surface-directed amyloids
on neural stem cells (NSCs) and SH-SY5Y behavior and viability was
observed in real time using fluorescence microscopy (FM). It is demonstrated
that intertwisting fibrillar structures are produced from preformed
amyloidogenic aggregates but not from freshly dissolved monomers.
The so-developed amyloid fibrils induce significant toxicity in both
NSCs and SH-SY5Y cells. Our results suggest that the negatively charged
surface interacts with the originally helpful amyloid aggregates (mediating
OA and S100A9 toxicity), and triggers the formation of neurotoxic
amyloid structures.

Results and Discussion
Surface-Directed HEWL and
Aβ(1–40) Fibril Formation
Freshly dissolved
solutions of 10 mg/mL HEWL and 0.1 mg/mL Aβ(1–40)
were positioned under agitation at 800 rpm and elevated temperature
as described in the Methods section for 24 h. Thioflavin-T (ThT) binding
assay of HEWL shows a slow increase during the first 24 h, which is
followed by a steep rise of ThT fluorescence intensity during our
observation time until ca. 125 h (Figure S1). The absence of the lag phase in the ThT intensity curve indicates
the rapid formation of HEWL amyloid species under agitation. Using
both fluorescence imaging (FM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM),
the HEWL amyloids formed at the initial stage were characterized by
a round-shaped morphology (Figure 1A), and heights ranging from 4 to 8 nm and diameters
from 60 to 150 nm (Figure 1B). The ThT fluorescence signal shown in Figure 1A further verifies the amyloidogenic
nature of these round-shape structures. Similar round-shaped amyloid
structures were observed with the Aβ(1–40) peptide (Figure 1A), showing a height
of 4–6 and diameter of 60–80 nm (Figure 1B). Considering the AFM tip convolution effect
in the lateral direction, the HEWL and Aβ(1–40) aggregates
can be roughly estimated to be consisted of hundreds to thousands
of molecules, respectively, which far exceeds the size of typical
oligomers (e.g., 20 or 30 mers).54

Figure 1 Fluorescence
microscopy (FM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images of amyloid β(1–40) and HEWL fibril formation directed
by the mica surface. (A) FM and (B,C) AFM images of HEWL and Aβ(1–40)
oligomers and fibrils reveal that the negatively charged mica surface
facilitates morphological transition of preformed oligomers to fibrillar
structures. To form amyloidogenic oligomers, 10 mg/mL HEWL and 0.1
mg/mL Aβ(1–40) were subjected to continuous shaking at
800 rpm (57 °C for HEWL and 37 °C for Aβ(1–40)
for 24 h. The preformed oligomers are then deposited on the mica surface.
Amyloid fibrils dominate the surface after incubation of entire mica
pieces in deionized (DI) water for 24 h. For fluorescence imaging,
all samples are stained by flushing with 100 mM ThT solution, followed
by imaging using a 60× oil immersion objective lens. As ThT molecules
bind specifically to the beta-sheet structures, the fluorescent images
show the development of amyloidogenic structures. Scale bars denote
500 nm in all AFM images.

HEWL and Aβ(1–40) amyloid aggregates were then deposited
on the negatively charged mica surface and developed in a large volume
of DI water at room temperature. AFM images show that round-shaped
Aβ(1–40) aggregates associate and form elliptically shaped
structures within 4 h (Figure 1B). The fibrillar structures carrying an intertwisted conformation
emerged after ∼16 h. In the meantime, quantities of round-shaped
aggregates decrease, indicating structural transition (Figure 1B). Staining of ThT reveals
the amyloidogenic nature of these developed fibrils (Figures 1A and S2). Notably, in the intermediate state (16 h), when aggregates
and fibrillar structures coexist, there are fibrils extended in the
radial direction away from the core aggregates. These results suggest
that fibrillar structures originate from these large amyloidogenic
aggregates. In contrast, the fibrillar structures originating from
HEWL amyloidogenic aggregates show no hints of an intertwisting morphology
(Figure 1C). The distinction
may reflect different packing arrangements of proteinaceous material
within the corresponding fibrils.

Compelling evidence suggests
that Aβ(1–40) very rapidly
and efficiently forms spherical amyloid aggregates at neutral pH (Figure S3A–F). In contrast, the conversion
from oligomers to amyloid fibrils is slow, following a nucleated conversion
mechanism (Figures S3 and S4).55,56 The acidic pH and continuous
shaking expedite the process and lead to the formation of mature fibrils
(Figure S5).57 Aβ(1–40) fibrils, which were produced after continuous
shaking for 2 weeks, are ca. 1 nm in height and 30 nm in width measured
by AFM and resemble these surface-directed amyloid structures, indicating
a similar packing arrangement. We suspect that the amyloid fibril
morphology varies depending on the association mechanism of the round-shaped
amyloid aggregates (Figures 1B and S4). As the fibrils on the
mica surface were formed by incubation of preformed amyloidogenic
aggregates (individual or associated), it is plausible that the fibrillar
transition on the mica surface follows a nucleated conformational
conversion mechanism similar to the bulk solution.

Conceivably,
after being “trapped”, the electrostatic
interactions between the negatively charged mica surface and positively
charged regions of beta-sheet contents help align the otherwise randomly
packed amyloidogenic aggregates and thus facilitate the formation
of fibrillar structures.58,59 Consistently, when
the electrostatic interactions are perturbed by the addition of excessive
salt, smaller amounts of fibrillar structures emerge on the mica surface
(Figure 2A). For example,
quantities of fibrillar structures with 50 mM NaCl diminished down
to ∼40% of the ones after 24 h development in DI water. The
transition from round-shaped oligomers to intertwisted fibrils is
hindered by the increase in ionic strength, and the effect depends
on the added salt concentration (Figure 2B–D). Additionally, with increasing
salt concentration, the preformed amyloidogenic aggregates seem to
be able to further accumulate, which may be caused by mediated electrostatic
interactions.

Figure 2 (A) AFM images show Aβ(1–40) structures during
transition
from pre-formed amyloid aggregates to fibrils on the mica surface
with different ionic strengths. Following the deposition on the mica
surface, amyloidogenic species are incubated in DI water for 0 h (top
panel), 4 h (middle) and 16 h (bottom) before imaging. The scale bars
denote 1000 nm in all figures. (B–D) Ratio between Aβ
oligomers and fibrillar structures is estimated by measuring the surface
coverage percentage. To perturb electrostatic interactions between
the Aβ peptide and mica surface, (B) 0, (C) 20, and (D) 50 mM
NaCl are added to the development solution. Our results demonstrate
that with the emergence of fibrillar structures, there is a significant
decrease in the quantities of oligomers, suggesting structural transition.
The transition is affected by environmental ionic strength.

Effect of Surface-Directed Amyloids on SH-SY5Y
and NSCs
The effect of Aβ(1–40) and HEWL amyloids
on the viability
of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was assessed by WST-1 assay. SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells were pre-incubated with the amyloid and control
samples from 1 to 3 d, followed by measuring the cell viability (Figure 3). Freshly dissolved
Aβ(1–40) and its amyloid aggregates formed after 24 h
shaking at neutral pH did not induce a significant decrease in cell
viability. The level of cell survival dropped to ca. 80% and even
to ca. 60% upon incubation with Aβ(1–40) fibrils formed
after incubation at acidic pH for 2 and 3 d, respectively (Figure 3A). In contrast,
all HEWL samples did not induce observable changes in cell viability
under similar experimental conditions (Figure 3B). Considering the fact that 5 μL
of protein solution was diluted 20 times after mixing with 100 μL
of cell solution before WST-1 assay, we further increase protein concentration
by concentrating HEWL and Aβ(1–40) amyloid aggregates
solutions. A decrease in the cell survival rate down to 50% for Aβ(1–40)
and 60% in the presence of HEWL amyloid aggregates was observed when
the protein concentration was increased by 5 fold (Figure 3C,D).

cells to assess viability, (1) 10 mg/ml HEWL and 0.1 mg/ml Aβ(1−40),
respectively; (2) 2 × 10 mg/ml HEWL, and 2 × 0.1 mg/ml Aβ(1−40);

(4) 4 × 10 mg/ml HEWL, and 4 × 0.1 mg/ml Aβ(1-40);
(5) 5 × 10 mg/ml HEWL and 5 × 0.1 mg/ml Aβ(1−40).
In figure (E): (1) control experiments: the cells were incubated in

100%. (2) control experiments: the cells were incubated in DMEM cell
culture medium on bare mica surface. (3) on mica surface-directed
HEWL fibrils. (4) on surface-directed Aβ(1−40) fibrils.

The effect of surface-directed Aβ(1–40)
and HEWL amyloid
fibrils on the SH-SY5Y cell line was measured by WST-1 upon incubation
of cells on the amyloid-coated mica surface (Figure S6). It has been reported that a hydrophilic and negatively
charged surface is suitable for cell growth.60 Although mica possesses both characters, cell viability on the mica
surface decreased by ca. 10% during 1–2 d of incubation and
by ca. 15% upon 3 d of incubation (Figure 3E). In the presence of surface-directed Aβ(1–40)
amyloids, the cell survival rate decreased by ca. 20% on the 2 d of
incubation and by ca. 50% on 3 d of incubation, which are statistically
significant changes. The viability of cells co-incubated with HEWL
fibrils formed on the mica surface did not change on the first day
of co-incubation and decreased by ca. 20% during the second day. There
was a significant decrease by ca. 35% on the third day. These results
suggest that the originally non-toxic Aβ and HEWL aggregates
can transit into toxic amyloidogenic structures with the assistance
of the negatively charged surface.

The effect of surface-directed
amyloids on NSCs was recorded in
real-time using fluorescence imaging. When being plated on the mica
surface decorated with these amyloid fibrils, NSC death was observed
within 20 h of incubation (Figure 4A,B and Video S1). It is
demonstrated that NSCs with a high Dcx level die early (Figure 4C), which is observed as disappeared
fluorescence signals (Figure S9), whereas,
the number of Hes5-positive NSCs maintains within 20 h incubation.
It is reasonable to conclude that differentiated NSCs (represented
by the high Dcx level) are more sensitive to stimulations induced
by surface-directed amyloid fibrils. Experiments performed using NSC
spheres show similar results. The originally round-shaped and dense
morphology of NSC spheres can hardly be maintained when in contact
with the mica surface decorated with amyloid fibrils. During the first
few hours, NSCs detach themselves from the peripherical region of
NSC spheres and adopt a round-shaped morphology. In the meantime,
Hes5 fluorescence disappears, suggesting cell death. In bright field
images, we observed that organization of NSC spheres is destructed
after 20 h. Fluorescence images show that the core of the Hes5-positive
cells remains, although with decreased volume (Figure 4D). These results together indicate that
NSC death is mostly induced by direct contact with amyloid fibrils,
which is consistent with Harte’s report that amyloid aggregates
are more toxic to differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.61

Figure 4 (A,C) Individual NSCs and (B,D) NSC spheres are maintained
on the
mica surface decorated with Aβ(1–40) amyloid fibrils.
For individual NSCs, the number of Dcx-positive cells decreased more
significantly compared to Hes5 positive cells, suggesting that NSCs
differentiated towards neurons are more sensitive to Aβ amyloid
fibrils, while, in the form of NSC spheres, it is observed that within
10 h incubation on the mica surface decorated with Aβ amyloid
fibrils, NSCs/NGCs detach themselves from the peripherical region
of NSC spheres and adopt a round-shaped morphology. Together with
images obtained in Hes5-GFP and Dcx-Desred channels, we conclude that
detached cells quickly die, and the ones within the sphere remain
alive. All these results demonstrate that NSCs with a high Dcx expression
level are more vulnerable to Aβ(1–40) amyloids, and NSCs
are better protected in spheres. In (C,D), each data point has 5 repeats.
Cell viability is assessed by normalizing cell numbers over time to
the initial value, and NSC sphere diameter to the original size. Scale
bars denote 50 μm in all images.

Studies on solid model surfaces such as hydrophobic Teflon surfaces,62,63 highly ordered pyrolytic graphite surfaces,64 hydrophilic silica surfaces,65 and hydrophilic
mica surfaces64,66 can provide mechanistic details
on how model surfaces alter and/or promote Aβ aggregation, elongation
and senile plaque formation, which verifies the role of the negatively
charged surface in the development of AD symptoms.67 The catalysis effect of surfaces (i.e., solid and membrane)
is also verified by simulation studies, showing that the membrane
can promote the formation of β-sheets.68−72 Indeed, single stranded and rope-like fibrillar structures
have been observed on a chemically modified mica surface.73 Twisting of protofibrils was rarely observed,
possibly due to the electrostatic trapping force provided by the mica
surface. In this study, neurotoxic Aβ(1–40) and HEWL
amyloid fibrils are produced by incubating preformed amyloid aggregates
on the mica surface in DI water. The difference lies in the fact that
we deposit preformed amyloid aggregates on the mica surface instead
of a freshly dissolved peptide. In bulk solution and on the surface,
fibril growth is accomplished by attaching peptide molecules to the
active ends of various fibrillar structures. The proteinaceous material
can be protein molecules attached to the mica surface or freely diffused
molecules in solution. It is likely that Aβ monomers and protofibrils
bind tightly to the surface, and thus these trapped single-stranded
protofibrils cannot twist around one another, as might readily occur
in solution.73 With preformed amyloid aggregates,
amyloid fibrils form by association and rearrangement of the β-sheet
content during incubation in DI water. The volume of the aggregates
provides separation from the surface and allows the protofibrils to
twist around one another. Moreover, amyloid aggregates are composed
of numerous β-sheet fragments, which are electrostatically polar
structures.73 The study using all-atom
explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations reveals
that Aβ amyloid formation involves the electrostatic interaction
among His, Glu and Asp residues.74 The
negatively charged mica surface may provide alignment and facilitate
the association of those amyloid fragments and monomers in the larger
amyloid structures. As the twisted conformation is shared by various
β-amyloids and often was toxic, the development of protofilaments
from amyloid aggregates on a charged surface may be pathologically
related to AD.75−78

The effect of surface-directed amyloids on the neural system
is
investigated using the neuron-origin SHSY5Y cell-line and NSCs. For
SHSY5Y, HEWL and Aβ(1–40) were toxic in two circumstances:
developed on the mica surface and large quantities of amyloidogenic
aggregates (non-mature fibrils and gels). As mature HEWL and Aβ(1–40)
fibrillar aggregates are not toxic, it is conceivable that surface-directed
Aβ(1–40) and HEWL fibrils were the toxic amyloid structures,
and the presence of the negatively charged surface in vivo may help
convert the non-toxic amyloidogenic aggregates into toxic amyloidogenic
structures. Previous studies reveal that formation of amyloidogenic
species can directly affect NSCs during the development of neurodegenerative
diseases.79 Evidence suggests that Aβ
amyloids lead to NSC death and differentiation,80 which may exhaust the stem cell pool and hinder the healing
process of the neural system. In this study, NSC differentiation and
self-maintenance are assessed at the single cell level by tracking
Hes5-GFP expression (indicative of self-renewing NSCs) and Dcx-RFP
to label neuroblasts (indicating progress towards differentiation).81−86 The NSC growth rate is another key feature we quantified to statistically
assess the self-renewal of NSCs. By quantitively analyzing real-time
NSC imaging on the mica surface decorated with Aβ(1–40)
amyloids, we demonstrate that NSCs with high expression of Dcx are
more vulnerable to toxic Aβ amyloidogenic structures. However,
the effect is diminished when NSCs are maintained as neural spheres,
where NSCs are protected from direct contact with Aβ amyloids.
These results suggest that surface-directed amyloids in-vivo may directly
cause neuron cell death, but exert less effect on NSCs.

Conclusions
Overall, our results, in combination with previous studies, emphasize
the importance of physical environmental conditions during AD development.
The negatively charged surface could not only induce the formation
of intertwisted protofilaments, but also provide a “dish”
filled with β-sheet structures. These β-sheet structures
may act as “seeds” for further amyloid formation and
finally senile plaques.

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
All chemicals including HEWL were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless mentioned differently. Aβ(1–40)
was produced by Alexotech (Umea, Sweden) in 0.5 mg weighed aliquots.
Experiments were performed by using Aβ peptide concentrations
of 0.1 mg/mL and HEWL 10 mg/mL, respectively, determined by weight
and optical density. HEWL was dissolved in 20 mM glycine buffer, pH
2.3. The Aβ(1–40) peptide was dissolved at low temperature
(on ice) following a protocol released previously.87 The chilled Aβ peptide powder was dissolved in 10
mM NaOH at a concentration above 1 mg/mL, followed by sonication in
an ice bath for 1 min. Then, a trace amount of 1 M NaH2PO4 buffer was added to adjust the sample solution to
either pH 7.4 or 3.0. The stock solution of the freely diffused Aβ
peptide was diluted to desired concentrations before experiments with
neutral pH.

Amyloidogenic structures (i.e., oligomers, large
aggregates and mature fibrils) were produced following different operational
protocols. To form densely packed amyloid fibrils, the HEWL solution
was subjected to shaking at 800 rpm at 57 °C for a week. An Aβ(1–40)
amyloid gel was formed by incubation at pH 3.0 and 37 °C for
a week with no agitation. Prior to cytotoxicity experiments, Aβ(1–40)
and HEWL amyloid fibrils were dialyzed to pH 7.4 at 4 °C. To
produce amyloid aggregates, HEWL (57 °C and pH 2.3) and Aβ(1–40)
(37 °C and pH 7.4) were subjected to agitation at 800 rpm for
24 h. The surface directed protofilaments formed by deposition of
amyloid aggregates on a mica surface. Firstly, Aβ(1–40)
and HEWL amyloid aggregate solutions were kept on the mica surface
for 30 and 5 min, respectively. Different deposition times were needed
due to the difference in concentrations. Mica pieces of ∼1
cm by 1 cm in size carrying amyloid aggregates were then thoroughly
washed in running water and incubated in a Petri dish holding a large
volume of DI water (∼10 mL) at room temperature for 24 h before
AFM, FM imaging, and cell viability tests.

ThT Assay
A ThT
stock solution was prepared by dissolving
2.5 mM ThT (Merck Schuchardt) in phosphate buffer (10 mM phosphate,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and filtered before use. This stock solution
was diluted 50-fold in the phosphate buffer to produce a working solution.
10 μL of protein aliquots were collected and added to 300 μL
of the working solution. The mixture was incubated in the dark for
1 min to allow ThT binding. The ThT fluorescence intensity was measured
using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (JobinYvon/Psex Instruments).
The excitation and emission wavelengths are 440 and 485 nm, respectively.
The slit width is 5 nm. The ThT fluorescence intensities were normalized
to the fluorescence intensity of the free dye in solution.

Atomic
Force Microscopy
All imaging experiments were
carried out at room temperature in air with a Dimension 3000, Veeco,
Woodbury, NY, and a PicoPlus, Agilent atomic force microscope. Images
were acquired in the tapping mode with silicon (Si) cantilevers (spring
constant of 20–100 N/m) and operated below their resonance
frequency (typically 230–410 kHz). The images were flattened.
The contrast and brightness were adjusted for optimum viewing conditions.
Amyloid samples produced in solution were deposited on the surface
of freshly cleaved mica (Good Fellow) for 5 min (HEWL) and 30 min
(Aβ(1–40)). The mica pieces were washed 3 times with
200 μL of DI water and dried in a flow of N2 gas
at room temperature. The samples with surface-directed fibrils were
taken out from DI water and dried with a flow N2 gas prior
to imaging.

Fluorescence Imaging
Aβ(1–40)
and HEWL
amyloid structures were deposited on mica. To visualize the structures,
mica pieces were flushed with a 100 μM ThT solution, followed
by washing with DI water3–5 times. The fluorescence of the
stained amyloids was visualized with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence
microscope equipped with a 100 W mercury lamp, a UV filter set, and
a 60× oil immersion objective. A UV light shutter controlled
the exposure time of ThT fluorescence. Images were recorded using
a charge coupled device camera (Olympus DP 70).

Cell Culture
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CRL-2266)
were routinely cultured in the Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. NSCs were isolated
and cultured from rat embryos of day 16.5. Disassociated cortical
hemispheres were cut into 1 mm 3 pieces in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.2) with 10 mM d-glucose. Small pieces of
cortical tissue were collected and enzymatically dissociated by using
a Papain Dissociation System as indicative materials (Worthington
Biochemical Corp). Neurospheres composed of NSCs formed in 1 week
of initial planting in the Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing
2% (v/v) NS21 supplement, 0.5 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in an incubator with 95% humidity,
37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. The NSCs were passaged weekly
by mechanically and enzymatically dissociating the neurospheres. Both
SH-SY5Y and NSC viable cells were counted following staining with
0.2% (w/v) trypan blue (Gibco/Invitrogen) and plated at a density
of 10,000 cells per well (100,000 cells/mL) in a 96-well black-walled
imaging plate (BD Falcon). To investigate the effect of surface-directed
amyloids on NSCs, specially cut mica pieces with and without preattached
amyloid structures were positioned on the bottom of the well, followed
by the same procedure of cell culturing (Figure S5).

WST-1 Cell Viability Assay
In viable
cells, WST-1 undergoes
reduction by mitochondrial dehydrogenases (succinatetetrazoliumreductase
system) to soluble formazan, which serves as an indicator of the quantity
of metabolically active cells. 10 μL of WST-1 reagent was added
and coincubated with the cell solutions at 37 °C for 4 h to evaluate
cell viability. The absorbance was measured using an ELISA plate reader
(LabSystems Multiskan RC) at 450 nm. The cell viability was expressed
as a percentage of absorbance in wells containing cells treated with
amyloids compared to the control cells.

Live-Cell Fluorescence
Microscopy
For image acquisition,
a Nikon Ti2E microscope with an automated translational stage and
a digital CMOS camera (ORCA-Flash 4.0, Hamamatsu, Japan) was used.
The stage and image acquisition was controlled via NIS Elements software
(Nikon, Japan). During imaging, the external conditions were set to
standard culture conditions (5% CO2 and 37 °C external
temperature) and maintained at this level.
