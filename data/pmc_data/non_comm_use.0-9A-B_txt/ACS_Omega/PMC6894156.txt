It
is of utmost importance to detect hazardous chemicals that affect
human health. In this work, a simple method has been developed using
a traditional medicinal herb Aloe vera as a carbon source to fabricate a nano-bioconjugate film. The nano-bioconjugate
system comprises of A. vera gel itself
and sodium alginate to form a fluorescent nano-bioconjugate film.
The film was successfully used as an optical “turn-off”
sensor in detecting analytes viz. para-Aminobenzoic
acid (PABA), benzophenone, hydroquinone, and propylparaben, which
are used in cosmetics and are listed as “red-listed”
chemicals. The applicability of the fluorescent film in detecting
these hazardous chemicals was even assessed with some locally purchased
cosmetic samples. Mechanistic insight into the fluorescent quenching
shown by nano-bioconjugate film is also discussed. Developments of
such a detection system from sustainable sources make it an interesting
option for fabricating sensors for hazardous chemicals.

Introduction
Nature manifests innumerable
sources for the fabrication of new
biomaterials to be utilized in varied desirable applications. One
such source is the traditional medicinal herb, Aloe
vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller), known as the “plant of immortality”, which
has its usage not only in the health-care sector but also in the cosmetics
and food industry.1 Such versatility of A. vera exists due to the wide range of chemical
compounds with various biological properties found in the innermost
jelly portion of the leaf.2 It has been
reported that most of the beneficial effects of the aloe gel are attributed
to the presence of aloe mucopolysaccharides.3 The goodness of A. vera has been
further exploited in the field of nanotechnology in the form of hydrogels,
nanoparticles, nanocomposites, and nanofibers to use in biomedical
applications like drug delivery, tissue engineering, wound healing,
etc. There are reports wherein the A. vera gel is blended with both synthetic and biopolymers, and such bioconjugate
materials are used in wound-healing applications. Park et al. synthesized
a hydrogel consisting of a mixture of A. vera gel, poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) by freeze-thaw
and γ-irradiation techniques and applied as a wound dressing
material.4 On the other hand, Pereira et
al. fabricated a hydrogel using sodium alginate and A. vera to examine its wound-healing ability.5 In terms of nanoformulations, there are several
reports of usage of A. vera; for example,
electrospun polycaprolactum-A. vera nanofibers were designed as wound-healing material6 and nanofibrous scaffolds using PLACL, silk fibroin, and A. vera were designed for tissue regeneration.7 The addition of A. vera in all such cases exhibited improved adhesion and proliferation
of cells.

Recently, carbon dots (CDs) derived from natural sources
have been
gaining attention among the research fraternity due to several advantages
over other carbon sources. Natural products are economically viable,
renewable, and biocompatible. Due to their rich functionality and
occurrence of heteroatoms (N, S), there is no requirement of passivating
and doping while synthesizing carbon dots, thereby making the route
simpler and cost-effective.8 As per the
literature, different varieties of natural products used in making
CDs are being reported, viz. milk,9 green
tea,10 honey,11 egg,12 coriander leaves,13 banana,14 and spices (cinnamon,
black pepper)15 among a few. Moreover,
their excellent fluorescent properties have been utilized in sensing
biomolecules, synthetic food colorants, etc. For example, Baruah et
al. used Tea CDs for dopamine sensors.16 Vandarkuzhali et al. prepared Nitrogen containing carbon dots (CDs)
from the pseudostem of the banana plant and used as fluorescent sensors
for Fe3+ and S2O32– ions in cancerous cells.17

There
are thousands of chemicals present in cosmetics and health-care
products, many of which get absorbed into the skin. The common people,
especially in underdeveloped countries, are ignorant of the fact that
many of the ingredients cause skin irritation, endocrine disruption,
and reproductive toxicity and hence are carcinogenic. Even a campaign
for safe cosmetics in coalition with Breast Cancer Prevention Partner
(BCPP) has been active since 2004 to create awareness of their adverse
effects and they have been grouped into “red-listed”
chemicals.18 For example, chemicals like para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), parabens (used as preservative),
benzophenone (BP), and hydroquinone (HQ), commonly present in creams/lotions,
are known to easily penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream after
which they mimic and interfere with reproductive functions19 and influence the development of malignant melanoma,
a form of skin cancer.20 Most of them even
inhibit thyroxine, a hormone that regulates metabolism, resulting
in hypothyroidism.21 Owing to such hazardous
effects, there is a necessity to design a system that can detect the
presence of such ingredients. Detection based on optical sensing strategies
is quite convenient due to its faster and simpler methodology.

Herein, this work demonstrates a facile, cost-effective, and greener
approach to obtain fluorescent CDs from A. vera via microwave treatment that are immobilized in a bioconjugate system
comprising of A. vera gel itself and
sodium alginate to form a fluorescent nano-bioconjugate film. In the
process, the biopolymer, sodium alginate, known as a gelling agent,
aids A. vera in film formation. The
film could serve as an optical “turn-off” sensor in
detecting all four structurally similar analytes, viz., PABA, benzophenone,
hydroquinone, and propylparaben (PP), which are used in cosmetics
and are listed as red-listed chemicals. Also, the practical applicability
of the film for the detection of the presence of such harmful chemicals
was tested using some cosmetic products locally available. A probable
mechanism of fluorescence quenching is also discussed.

Results and Discussion
This work illustrates the use of the popularly known medicinal
plant A. vera in fabricating a bioconjugate
film and synthesizing carbon dots from its leaf gel to form a nanoconjugate
system by immobilizing carbon dots prepared from A.
vera leaf gel. First, carbon dots were synthesized
from A. vera leaf gel. Scheme 1 shows the diagram portraying
the method employed in preparing the A. vera carbon dot (CDAV) along with the fabrication of the bioconjugate
film. In the process of fabrication, the biopolymer sodium alginate
was used as a base material for film-casting since aloe gel itself
could not form films and hence the resultant product is termed as
a bioconjugate system. CDAV was prepared using the microwave
technique described in detail in the Experimental
Section. It needs to be mentioned here that there is no report
of a microwave synthetic protocol for preparation of carbon dots from A. vera.23 The successful
preparation of the carbon dots was determined by the formation of
a yellowish-brown aqueous solution that gave bright blue luminescence
under the illumination of UV light, indicating proper carbonization
of dry aloe flakes to form fluorescent carbon dots. Different characterization
techniques were applied to confirm the carbon dot formation. The UV–visible
spectrum in Figure 1A showed the absorption maximum at 281 nm, which can be attributed
to n → π* transition, implying the presence of C=O
functionalities on the carbon dot surface.24 It should also be noted that there is no absorbance in the visible
region and hence A. vera carbon dots
(CDAV) could act as a UV-blocking material. CDAV is fluorescent material. Photoluminescence (PL) studies were done
on CDAV, as shown in Figure 1B. It is evident from the stacked PL spectra that with
increase in the excitation wavelength from 310 to 370 nm, the emission
maxima of carbon dots is accompanied by increased fluorescence intensity.
The origin of such a peak can be hypothesized to the creation of emissive
centers and surface states25 that might
be formed due to the presence of various O-containing functionalities
on the carbon dot surface. Besides, the PL spectra depicted excitation-independent
behavior is unlike the generalized excitation-dependent PL behavior
of carbon dots.26 This might be due to
the uniformity of the surface/molecular states’ distribution.27,28 The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement of CDAV shown in Figure 1C confirms the formation of carbon dots with the average particle
size determined to be 3.5 nm. The particle size is in confirmation
when correlated with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of CDAV. The TEM image shown in Figure 1D is in agreement with the DLS measurement,
clearly showing the particles smaller than 5 nm and spherical.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of the Protocol Adopted in Preparing a Nano-Bio-Conjugate
Film of Carbon Dot-Immobilized A. vera-Alginate Film
A.
vera carbon dot (CDAV) could successfully
exhibit antimicrobial activity against both
Gram positive and Gram negative pathogenic bacterial strains Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia
coli, respectively. A significant inhibitory zone
was formed for both strains for which the diameter measured was 22
mm for MRSA and 21 mm for E. coli (Figure 2). It is interesting
to note that as per literature reports, A. vera gel aqueous extract has no activity against S. aureus and E. coli;29,30 however, our observation shows that when A. vera gel is converted to carbon dots, it demonstrates substantial activity
against such strains.

Figure 2 Antimicrobial activity of CDAV. Photographs
showing
the inhibition zones against (A) MRSA (B) E. coli.

The CDAV so formed
was incorporated into the 3:1 aloe-alginate
system to fabricate the nano-bioconjugate film (A.
vera-alginate-carbon dot bioconjugate film, AV-Alg-CDAV). It is interesting to note here that the nano-bioconjugate
film using only A. vera could not be
fabricated. AV-Alg-CDAV film was then subjected to different
characterization techniques.

Figure 3A depicts
the UV–visible spectrum of AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate
film exhibiting two absorption maxima. The peak at 210 nm is due to
n → σ* transition, requiring higher energy, showing the
presence of −OH groups in the film, whereas the peak at 273
nm corresponds to n → π* transition occurring due to
C=O groups. This confirms the successful conjugation of alginate
and aloe system, which otherwise is not present in CDAV. The AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film is fluorescent. So
photoluminescence studies were carried out using a solid setup (Figure 3B). It is evident
from the emission spectra that with the increase in excitation wavelength
from 340 to 370 nm, there is a gradual increase in its fluorescence
intensity. The inset figure shows the photograph of AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film when viewed under UV light. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were recorded to have an insight into the
topology of the nanoconjugate film. The representative SEM image is
shown in Figure 3C.
It is clear from the figure that CDAV is immobilized in
the AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film, resulting in making
the film fluorescent.

The thermal stability of the AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate
film was studied and compared with the bare AV-Alg film. The stacked
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms of AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film and AV-Alg film are shown in Figure 4A. The thermograms showed mainly
two degradation stages for both films. The first stage of degradation
started at 36 °C and continued to 100 °C with 24% weight
loss in AV-Alg film versus 15% weight loss in AV-Alg-CDAV film. Such a small weight loss could be due to the side chain breaking
of alginate and glycerol. The second stage underwent maximum degradation,
which started at 160 °C and continued up to 262 °C, in which
there was 71% weight loss for AV-Alg film and 63% for AV-Alg-CDAV film. Therefore, the data clearly shows that the incorporation
of CDAV results in improved thermal stability of the film.
The better thermal stability of AV-Alg-CDAV can be due
to the presence of uniform carbon cores of aloe mucopolysaccharides,
which could be responsible for forming stronger interactions among
the aloe-alginate conjugate system. Similarly, Fourier transform infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) study was carried out on AV-Alg-CDAV and AV-Alg films to identify the functional groups present in the
bioconjugate films and interaction of different units of the conjugate
film, as shown in Figure 4B. The broadening of the peak around 3300 cm–1 in FTIR spectra clearly indicates hydrogen bonding between the −OH
groups of alginate, glycerol, and the carbon dot system.31 The peak around 2900 and 824 cm–1 corresponds to C–H stretching and bending, respectively.
The peak of strong intensity at 1613 cm–1 indicates
C=O stretching, whereas the peak around 1100 cm–1 corresponds to C–O stretching. All such peaks suggest the
presence of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxylic moieties on both films.
In fact, no notable differences in FTIR peaks are observed in both
the films, thereby indicating the presence of similar functionalities.
Mechanical properties were also investigated for AV-Alg-CDAV and AV-Alg films by recording their tensile strength (TS) (Figure 4C). It was observed
that AV-Alg film has a TS of 5.9 MPa, which increased to 7.8 MPa on
incorporation of carbon dots, for the film AV-Alg-CDAV.
This can be attributed to the increasing number of electrostatic interactions
formed between the biopolymer and carbon dots, thereby indicating
that the incorporation of CDAV improved the mechanical
properties of the film.

Interestingly, the fluorescent film AV-Alg-CDAV could
act as an optical sensor in detecting p-aminobenzoic
acid (PABA), an ingredient used in sunscreens, termed as a red-listed
chemical. Figure 5A
represents the stacked PL plot of AV-Alg-CDAV on exposure
to different concentrations of PABA. It could be observed that the
intensity of the PL emission peak excited at 370 nm is quenched considerably
in the presence of different concentrations of PABA solution ranging
from 10–3 to 10–8 M. The quenching
in fluorescence intensity is in the range of 37.7–71.5%. The
corresponding nonlinear Stern–Volmer plot was obtained and
is plotted as shown in Figure 5B.

Figure 5 (A) PL emission spectra of AV-Alg-CDAV nano-bioconjugate
film in the presence of different concentrations of PABA at an excitation
wavelength of 370 nm; (B) corresponding Stern–Volmer nonlinear
plot.

Further, other fluorescence-quenching
parameters, such as apparent Kd values
(dissociation constant) of different
concentrations of the analyte PABA (Table S1) and a linear detection range (Figure S1) were evaluated and are provided in the Supporting Information. The linear detection range was plotted using few
initial points as the system has a Stern–Volmer nonlinear plot.

Similarly, another structurally similar chemical used as an ingredient
in cosmetics and also termed as a red-listed chemical is hydroquinone
(HQ). The PL emission study of AV-Alg-CDAV in presence
of different concentrations of HQ is shown in Figure 6A. The stacked PL spectra reveal that there
is substantial quenching of PL intensity (more than 90%) when the
film is in contact with HQ. In this case also, the concentration range
of HQ was 10–3–10–8 M.
Another structurally similar chemical used as an ingredient in cosmetics
is benzophenone (BP). On a similar line, the PL emission study of
AV-Alg-CDAV in presence of different concentrations of
BP is shown in Figure 6B. In this case too, quenching of PL intensity takes place when treated
with BP. The concentration range for the study is 10–3–10–8 M, and quenching of PL (30–50%)
takes place in the presence of BP. The last structurally similar compound
that is also a commonly used ingredient in cosmetics and termed as
a red-listed chemical is propylparaben (PP). The stacked PL spectra
of AV-Alg-CDAV in presence of PP are shown in Figure 6C. The PL intensity
is like before; quenching of PL intensity takes place when treated
with PP in the concentration range of 10–3–10–8 M. The quenching % is also lower than that of PABA
and HQ and is in the range of 20–40%.

AV-Alg-CDAV nano-bioconjugate
film in presence of different concentrations of (A) hydroquinone (HQ),
(B) benzophenone, and (C) propylparaben at an excitation wavelength
of 370 nm.

Analysis of Real Samples
The potential
applicability
of AV-Alg-CDAV film was assessed with two locally available
cosmetic products. It was found that when the fluorescent film was
subjected to the extract prepared from the real samples, there occurred
a substantial quenching of the film as observed from the PL emission
spectra at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. Figure 7 demonstrates the PL emission spectra of
two real samples, namely, RS-1 and RS-2, and is thereby successful
in detecting the presence of harmful chemicals in cosmetics. RS-1
and RS-2, as per the chemical composition provided with the product,
contain PABA and PP among others.

of real samples at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The trade name
of the cosmetic product is concealed.

Figure 8 gives the
representative histogram plot comparing the change of fluorescence
intensity of AV-Alg-CDAV film in the presence of all analytes,
viz., PABA, HQ, BP, and PP, at 10–3 M and the two
real samples RS-1 and RS-2 (arbitrary concentration). The histogram
plot clearly shows that the quenching efficiency is higher for PABA
and HQ. However, when compared with PABA and HQ, BP and HQ show lesser
efficiency. Thus, AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film is able
to successfully detect chemicals that are used in cosmetics and are
listed as red-listed chemicals.

intensity of AV-Alg-CDAV nano-bioconjugate film in the
presence of different analytes.

Mechanistic Insight
We tried to understand the mechanism
of fluorescence quenching as shown by AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate
film in the presence of PABA, HQ, BP, and PP. The surface immobilization
of fluorescent CDAV onto the AV-Alg film renders the bioconjugate
film fluorescent. There is still no agreement on the exact reason
for the origin of fluorescence in carbon dots. However, radiative
recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, quantum
confinement, emissive traps, free zigzag sites, edge defects, surface
states, surface passivation, and inner-filter effects are some of
the reasons underlined for emission properties of carbon dots.32−34 In presence of analytes (PABA, HQ, BP, and PP) as in our case, CDAV acts as an electron donor producing excited electrons after
being irradiated by excitation light and then transfers electrons
to the analyte, which causes the fluorescence quenching of the CDs.
The schematic representation of the electron transfer (ET) process
is shown in Scheme 2.

Conclusions
There is a need to detect carcinogenic
chemicals used in cosmetics,
viz. PABA, benzophenone, hydroquinone, and propylparaben. In this
work, we fabricated a fluorescent nano-bioconjugate film of A. vera -alginate incorporating carbon dots obtained
from A. vera. The nano-bioconjugate
film was then used successfully to detect carcinogenic chemicals (PABA,
HQ, BP, and PP) used in cosmetics. The feasibility of using AV-Alg-CDAV bioconjugate film in a real situation was demonstrated by
detecting these chemicals in cosmetic products purchased from the
local market. The development of such a nano-bioconjugate film system
from sustainable materials like A. vera and alginate pave the way for using greener materials for detecting
hazardous materials.

Experimental Section
Materials
Alginic
acid sodium salt was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, India. A. vera was collected
from IASST campus, Guwahati, India. p-Aminobenzoic
acid (PABA) and benzophenone were purchased from SRL. Hydroquinone,
propylparaben, glycerol anhydrous, ethanol, and acetic acid were all
purchased from Merck, India. All chemicals mentioned were used without
any further purification. Distilled water was used throughout for
conducting the experiments.

Methods
Synthesis of A. Vera Carbon Dot
A. vera leaves collected were washed
thoroughly with water. The fleshy inner gel was peeled off and oven-dried.
The inner gel consists of 99% water, so it was allowed to remove water
completely such that only the dried aloe flakes were left over. The
aloe flakes mainly consisted of mucopolysaccharides along with a very
small amount of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.1 Dry aloe flakes (0.5 g) were then dispersed in 10 mL of
water and subjected to microwave treatment at 200 °C for 30 min.
The pressure and power of the microwave were maintained throughout
at 13.5 bar and (20–30) W, respectively. The resultant solution
was yellowish-brown. This was then followed by centrifugation (10 000
rpm for 15 min) and filtration to discard the residual part so as
to collect the supernatant liquid having a concentration of 40 mg/mL.

Preparation of A. vera-Alginate
Bioconjugate Film
Solvent-casting method was used for fabricating
the bioconjugate film. This process was followed by the preparation
of sodium alginate solution and A. vera solution separately. Sodium alginate solution (5% (w/v)) was prepared
whereby during the process, glycerol (50% w/w, wrt the mass of alginate)
was added to the solution. On the other hand, a 5% w/v solution of A. vera gel was prepared. The two solutions were
then mixed in the ratio of 3:1 (optimized) and were subjected to magnetic
stirring for 2 h. The resulting mixture was cast into a Petri dish
and was kept in a hot-air oven at approximately 55 °C. The dried
films were then peeled off from the Petri dish and stored in desiccator
under vacuum. The bioconjugate film so formed was termed as AV-Alg.

Preparation of Nano-Bioconjugate Film
This method involves
the immobilization of A. vera carbon
dot in the bioconjugate film. A similar solvent-casting method was
followed. In this process, A. vera carbon
dots (1%) were added to the solution of a 3:1 mixture of A. vera gel solution and sodium alginate solution,
subjected to magnetic stirring for 3 h. The homogenized solution was
then cast into a Petri dish and put in a hot-air oven, maintaining
the temperature around 55 °C. After complete drying, the film
was formed and peeled off from the Petri dish; it was then stored
in a desiccator at room temperature. The nano-bioconjugate film so
obtained was termed as AV-Alg-CDAV.

Fluorescence
Quenching of the Nano-Bioconjugate Film by Different
Analytes:
Four structurally similar analytes, such as p-aminobenzoic
acid (PABA), hydroquinone (HQ), benzophenone (BP), and propylparaben
(PP) were used for this purpose. Different concentrations of each
of the analyte solutions were taken in which PABA solution was prepared
with 10 M acetic acid, HQ in water, and BP and PP in ethanol. Uniformly
sized films (1 × 1 cm2) were dipped into the analyte
solution of different concentrations for 10 min and then taken out
and dried, after which PL measurement of the films was then recorded
to see the difference.

Preparation of the Extract from the Cosmetic
Products (Real
Samples)
To a small amount of the real sample, 10 mL of ethanol
was added and magnetically stirred for 2 h to form a suspension. The
extract was then collected by simply filtering the suspension so as
to separate it off from the residue.

Fluorescence quenching
of the AV-Alg-CDAV film with that of the prepared extract
from real samples was checked following the same protocol that of
the four structurally similar analytes.

Characterization
The synthesized carbon dots from A. vera were characterized using different experimental
techniques. Particle size was determined using dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurement on Malvern ZS90. Optical measurements were carried
out by recording the UV–visible spectrum using a Shimadzu UV
spectrophotometer UV-2600, and emission spectra, using a Jasco spectrofluorometer,
FP-8300. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was taken
in a JEOL TEM-2100 plus model by the drop-casting method on a carbon-coated
copper grid. Further characterizations were carried out for the as-prepared
films (with and without carbon dots) to get an insight into the changes
occurring after the incorporation of the nanomaterial. To study the
changes in the chemical environment, FTIR spectra were recorded using
the Nicolet 6700 FTIR instrument using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of both films was carried out with a PerkinElmer 4000
instrument in the range of 35–800 °C, maintaining the
heating rate at 10 °C/min under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min.
Tensile strength (TS) measurement of the films was done on Universal
Testing Machine (Tinius Olsen 5ST) using a 2.5 kg load cell at a speed
of 5 mm/min. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
film containing the carbon dot were recorded on a Carl Zeiss ∑igma
VP instrument.

Antimicrobial Test
The antimicrobial
activity of the
synthesized A. vera carbon dots was
determined by the agar-well diffusion method. For this experiment,
two model organisms were selected, namely, Gram positive Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Gram negative E. coli. MRSA and E. coli cells were inoculated in a sterilized nutrient broth medium and
incubated overnight in a shaking incubator at 37 °C. Both the
bacterial strains were then transferred and cultured on sterilized
nutrient agar plates.22 During the process,
wells were punched in the plates using a sterile stainless steel borer.
Three hundred microliters of A. vera carbon dot (CDAV) was filled into the wells of each of
the plates and was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The diameters
of the inhibited zone were measured in millimeters. Sterilized distilled
water was used as control.
