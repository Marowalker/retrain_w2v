Redox flow batteries have received wide attention because of their
unique advantages such as high efficiency, long cycle life, low operating
cost, and independent adjustment of energy power. In this study, five
types of anthraquinone derivative organic redox couple were selected,
and the surfaces of graphite felt were modified. When the number of
functional groups is increased or the substitution position is closer
to the carbonyl (C=O) groups, a more pronounced hindrance for
the C=O reaction on the benzene ring is observed; thus, the
electrochemical performance and reversibility decreases. Sodium 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonate
solution is the best organic redox couple in terms of both reversibility
and electrochemical performance. It was also found that all the surface
treatment methods of graphite felt are beneficial for improving their
electrochemical performances. All these superior results demonstrate
that the graphite felt treated under air exposure at 550 °C for
3 h exhibited the best electrochemical performance, which might be
attributed to the increase in the content of C–OH functional
groups.

1 Introduction
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are not good for
mobility applications but they are important for stationary grid storage.
Their poor volumetric power density and need for subsystem components
for enabling continuous flow do not make them useful for mobile electric
vehicles.1,2 Grid storage for peak shaving, coupling
for solar and wind storage, and so forth are the domains of application
and for 1 MW or more storage, their expected project cost comes less
than that of lead acid, such as vanadium and Zn–Br RFBs. Currently,
RFBs are divided into two categories: inorganic metal-ion flow batteries
and organic flow batteries. In the field of inorganic metal-ion flow
batteries, vanadium flow batteries are the most developed devices.
The high and variable price of vanadium, however, renders these batteries
too expensive and risky for wide-scale commercialization.3 In recent years, researchers have found that
the development of RFBs based on inexpensive and sustainable redox-active
organic materials can overcome these drawbacks.4 According to the characteristics of the supporting electrolyte,
the organic flow battery system can be divided into water (aqueous
organic RFBs) and nonwater (non-aqueous RFBs) systems.5,6 Water-based flow batteries use aqueous solutions of acids, alkaline,
or salts as the supporting electrolyte. The main research on these
batteries focuses on increasing their energy density, reducing the
cost of active materials, and reducing the overall costs of the batteries.
Nonaqueous flow batteries use organic substances as the supporting
electrolyte and organic active materials dissolved in organic solvent
as reactants and the main research direction for these batteries is
toward obtaining a relatively high potential window;7 moreover, it was found that nonaqueous RFBs have higher
energy densities than those of aqueous RFBs; however, because of the
low conductivity of the nonaqueous electrolyte, their capacities are
limited. In aqueous organic redox-flow batteries (AORFBs), organic
charge-storage materials offer structural diversity, tenable redox
potential, and optimizable solubility.8 High aqueous solubility, well-separated reduction potentials barely
avoiding water splitting, stability, safety, and low costs at mass-production
scales constitute the most critical attributes of novel aqueous organic
electrolytes.8 Therefore, AORFBs have been
the subject of recent research.9−14 At present, most of the studies on AORFBs
have focused on the family of organic molecules called quinones.9,11,14

Quinones are a special
class of cyclic unsaturated diketones, and their conjugated structure
affords excellent electrochemical activity. Yang et al. suggested
that the proximity of the transfer coefficients to 0.5 and the high
rate constants suggest an “outer-sphere” process.14 Depending on the skeletal structure, these compounds
can be divided into benzoquinones, naphthoquinones, anthraquinones,
phenanthrenequinones, and four other quinone types. Among these, anthraquinones
are the most common, and most of their species are found in plants;
thus, they are relatively easy to obtain.

In 2009, Xu et al.
pioneered the use of organic quinones as active materials in RFBs.15 Subsequently, Huskinson et al.9 used a solution of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid
(AQDS) as the catholyte in a similar battery. The reaction shows the
balanced electrochemical reaction in a reversible manner with equilibrium
potential (standard potential).

Anthraquinone derivatives undergo
a kinetically fast
two-electron transfer reaction that is accompanied by the transfer
of two protons, provided the protons are necessary for the reaction.14 Gerhardt et al. applied AQDS and other quinone
derivatives as the catholyte in an aqueous quinone-bromide redox flow
battery.12 Chen et al. reported a cycling
analysis of the quinone/bromide RFB.16 Hofmann
et al. suggested that the incorporation of electron-withdrawing substituents,
such as −NO2, −COOCH3, or −CN,
leads to stronger oxidants, which increases the resultant redox potential,
thereby making these species well-suited as active catholyte materials.13 In these studies, however, there is no complete
study on the effects of the position and number of functional groups
on the electrocatalytic performance of modified graphite felt (GF)
electrodes. Additionally, in the above studies, researchers mostly
used carbon paper as the electrode material. However, in practical
applications of AORFBs, GF was used as the electrode materials. The
thickness and small surface area per unit volume of carbon paper compared
to that of traditional GF electrodes could result in a relatively
large concentration polarization, particularly at high current densities,
in a single cell. In addition, many studies have shown that the type
and number of functional groups on the surface of carbon materials
have a significant effect on the catalytic activity of the redox couple,17−20 which,
in turn, has a significant effect on the performance of the flow batteries.
The electrocatalytic mechanism of AORFBs working with GF electrodes
is different from those of traditional vanadium RFBs and other organic
liquid flow batteries. However, the effect of the surface modification
of GF electrodes on the electrochemical reactions of the quinone-based
redox couple has not been reported thus far, and there are few detailed
conclusions on the electrochemical reaction mechanism of anthraquinone
derivatives on the surface of modified GF.

In this study, five
types of anthraquinone derivative electrolytes were selected, and
the surfaces of GF electrodes were modified by heat treatment, acid
treatment, mixed treatment, and an elemental nitrogen-doping method.
The surface morphology, crystal structure, and surface chemical states
of the modified GF electrodes were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, we used cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the electrocatalytic
performance of the modified GF electrodes. The electrocatalytic reaction
mechanism of the anthraquinone derivative on the GF surface is also
discussed.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
The analytical-grade polyacrylonitrile-based GF was purchased from
Beijing Sanye Carbon (China) Co., Ltd. 9,10-Anthraquinone-1-sulfonate
sodium (1-AQS, 98%) and 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonate sodium (2-AQS,
97%) were supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co.,
Ltd. 9,10-Anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate (2,7-AQDS, > 95%) and 9,10-anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate
(1,5-AQDS, > 98%) were purchased from Tstachi (Shanghai) Industrial
Development Co., Ltd. Dopamine hydrochloride (98%, Aladdin) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride (Tris HCl, 99%, Aladdin) were of analytical grade and
used as provided without further purification. All the water used
in the whole experiment was deionized. Before each pretreatment, the
GF was cut to a size of 20 × 20 mm2.

2.2 Modification of GF
2.2.1 Method 1
The GF was
put in concentrated sulfuric acid (98.3 wt %) and soaked for 6, 12,
24, 36, or 48 h in room temperature. Then, the felt was washed repeatedly
with distilled water, soaked in distilled water for 24 h, and dried
in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The samples were named S-M h (where M is 6, 12, 24, 36, or 48)

2.2.2 Method 2
The GF was
soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid (98.3 wt %) and concentrated
nitric acid (68 wt %) solution that was mixed in a respective volume
ratio of 1:3 (S1N3), 1:1(S1N1), or 3:1(S3N1). After immersing in
solution for 24 h at room temperature, the felt was washed repeatedly
with distilled water, then soaked in distilled water for 24 h, and
dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C) for 24 h. The samples were named
SaNb-24 (where a is 1 or 3, and b is 1 or 3).

2.2.3 Method 3
The GF was
calcined in a muffle furnace at 450, 500, 550, or 600 °C and
held for a time (2 or 3 h). Then, the materials were naturally cooled
to room temperature. (Hereafter, A-M °C-N h is used to represent the GF sample under an air atmosphere
at a temperature of M °C for N h, where M is 450, 500, 550, and 600 and N is 2 or 3.)

2.2.4 Method 4
The GF was calcined in a vacuum furnace at
a heating rate of 5 °C min–1, and the temperature
was maintained at 450, 500, 550, or 600 °C and held for a time
(2 or 3 h). Finally, the GF was cooled to room temperature at the
rate of 5 °C per min–1. (Hereafter, V-M °C-N h is used to represent the
GF in a vacuum at a temperature of M °C for N h, where M is 450, 500, 550, and 600
and N is 2 or 3.)

2.2.5 Method 5
The GF was placed in a muffle
furnace, and the temperature is fixed at 500, 550, or 600 °C
and held for some time (2 or 3 h). Then, it was naturally cooled to
room temperature to complete the heat treatment in air. Subsequently,
the heat-treated GF was placed in a vacuum furnace, and then, the
temperature was raised at the rate of 5 °C per min–1 and maintained at 500, 550, or 600 °C for 2 or 3 h. The sample
was finally cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C per
min–1. The temperature and time of the sample for
heat treatment in the vacuum are the same as those used for the heat
treatment in air. (Hereafter, M–M °C-N h is used to indicate that the GF samples
are heated at a temperature of M °C for N h, where the second M is 500, 550, and
600 and N is 2 or 3.)

2.2.6 Method 6
The experiment is handled
in two sequences. For the method with acid soaking followed by heat
treatment, the GF was first soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid (98.3
wt %) for 24 h, washed repeatedly with distilled water, placed in
distilled water for 24 h, and finally dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C)
for 24 h. Then, the GF was heated in a muffle furnace to 550 °C
for 2 or 3 h and naturally cooled to room temperature. (Hereafter,
24 h–550 °C-N h represents the GF sample
first soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid (98.3 wt %) for 24 h and
then held at a temperature of 550 °C for N h,
in which N is 2 and 3). In the method with heat treatment
followed by the acid soaking process, GF was first placed in a muffle
furnace in which the temperature was held constant at 550 °C
for 2 or 3 h and then was naturally cooled to room temperature. The
heat-treated GF was placed in concentrated sulfuric acid (98.3 wt
%), soaked for 24 h, washed repeatedly with distilled water, placed
in distilled water for 24 h, and finally dried in a vacuum oven for
24 h. (Hereafter, 550 °C-N h-24 h represents
the GF first heated at a temperature of 550 °C for N h and then soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid for 24 h, in which N is 2 or 3.)

2.2.7 Method 7
First, the two combustion boats were placed
in the tubular furnace. One of the combustion boats was filled with
3 g of urea and 1 g of water. The two GFs were placed in the other
combustion boat. Then, the interior of the tube was evacuated. After
that, the tubular furnace was heated from 25 to 160 °C at the
rate of 5 °C per min–1 and held for 30 min
at 160 °C. Subsequently, at the same rate, the temperature was
raised from 160 to 700 °C and held for 5, 10, 15, or 20 h. In
the operation, if the pressure was higher than one atmosphere, the
outlet shutoff valve would be operated so that the part of the gas
in the tubular furnace enters the bottle that is filled with the acid
solution. The rate of temperature decrease was 5 °C min–1. (Hereafter, 700 °C-N h was used to indicate
that the GF samples were held at a constant temperature of 700 °C
for N h, in which N is 5, 10, and
15.)

2.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
CV and EIS were carried out using a PAR2273
potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research, USA) at room
temperature. In the three-electrode cell, a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) acts as the reference electrode. A GF (10 mm × 10 mm ×
10 mm) is used as the working electrode. The platinum plate (6.0 cm2 geometry surface area) served as the counter electrode. The
CVs were carried out at the potential versus SCE. The CV curves were
recorded in 1.00 mol L–1 H2SO4 + 1.00 mmol L–1 anthraquinone derivative. The
potential sweep rate is 25 mV s–1. EIS was performed
by applying an alternated voltage of 10 mV over the frequency ranging
from 0.01 to 105 Hz at the open-circuit potential.

Rotating-disc electrode (RDE) experiments were conducted using an
MSR RDE (Pine Research Instrumentation, Inc.) instrument equipped
with a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon disk working electrode, an SCE
reference electrode, and a platinum counter electrode. The electrolyte
was 1 M of H2SO4 and 1 mM anthraquinone
derivative.

2.4 Characterization
of PAN-Based GF before and after Treatment
The XRD of the
sample was recorded in an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2500/PC, Rigaku
Co., Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source operated
at 45 KV and 200 mA. The tests were carried out in the angle (2θ)
range from 5° to 80° at the scanning rate of 4° min–1. The morphology of the samples was observed with
a scanning electron microscope (FEI-Nanosem 430, USA). In this paper,
XPS (GENESIS 60S XP spectrometer,USA) was used to characterize the
chemical composition of the surfaces. The XP spectra were recorded
with Al Kα radiation as an excitation source. The survey spectra
were collected with pass energy of 187.85 eV at a step of 1.0 eV,
and the high-resolution spectra were collected with pass energy of
29.35 eV at a step of 0.25 eV. The binding energy scales for the samples
were corrected by referencing the C 1s binding energy to graphite
carbon at 284.5 eV. To determine the quantification of the elemental
concentrations and the binding states, a Shirley background was subtracted.
The high-resolution spectra were fitted with Gaussian/Lorentzian functions
to determine the concentrations of the atoms in the various binding
states. Viscosity measurement of the anthraquinone derivative was
conducted by a MCR 301 Viscometer (Anton Paar).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Materials’ Characterization
The XRD of the GF before and after treatment (Figure S1 and Table S1) show that
the seven pretreatment methods modified the structure of the GF. The
SEM images of the samples (Figure S2) show
that in addition to the heat treatment, the other three treatments
have minimal effect on the apparent morphology of the GF fibers. To
further delve into the surface chemical composition of GF, the XPS
analyses of four samples were conducted, as shown in Figure 1. As observed, the obvious
characteristic peaks located at 285 and 531 eV correspond to the C
1s and O 1s energy levels, respectively.21 The analysis of the XP Spectra revealed that the O/C ratio of the
pristine GF had a minimum value of 9.4%, and the O/C ratio of the
GF after acid treatment had a maximum value of 14.9%, as shown in Table 1. To further analyze
the changes in the content of oxygen-containing functional groups
on the surface of GF fibers, the peak fitting of C 1s for four samples,
as shown in Figure 1, was performed to compare the valence bonds of carbon, thus indicating
the presence of sp2 C=C (284.6 eV), C–OH
(286.1–286.3 eV), and C=O (287.3–287.6 eV) groups.22−24 According to the XPS analysis,
the hydroxyl content (C–OH) in the GF increases from 6.8 to
7.4% after air-heat treatment, and the carbonyl (C=O) content
increases from 2 to 3.6%. The C–OH content in the GF samples
after the concentrated sulfuric acid treatment increases from 6.8
to 13.5%, whereas the C=O content decreases from 2 to 1.85%,
probably because contamination could affect the results.

3.2 Electrochemistry
3.2.1 CV and RDE
There
are many types of organic quinone compounds. The five main compounds
used in this study are as follows: three anthraquinone derivatives
containing one sulfonate group, and two anthraquinone derivatives
containing two sulfonate groups. According to the previous studies,8−14 the structures of the five anthraquinone derivatives
and the proposed electrochemical reactions processes are shown in Figure S3. The specific cyclic unsaturated diketone
structure shown in the figure is the basic structure of the anthraquinone
derivatives; however, the types of substituents and the positions
of the substitutions for the different anthraquinone derivatives are
not the same. In general, we expect the molecules with conjugated
carbon–carbon bonds and keto- and enol-groups that allow the
delocalization and rearrangement of π electrons to undergo these
redox transformations with extraordinary ease.14 However, the results of most studies show that the dissociation
and rearrangement of C–C and C–H bonds do not occur
in these electrochemical reactions.

According to the reports
of González et al.25 and Jeong et
al.,26 this study uses the peak current
density as a measure of the electrode reactivity, in which a relatively
high peak current density corresponds to excellent catalytic activity
of the reaction. Figure 2a shows that the CV of the pristine GF in 2,7-AQDS solution is in
accordance with that reported by Huskinson et al.9Table S2 shows the electrochemical
data from the cyclic voltammograms of the pristine GF. The redox potential
(E), defined as the average value of anodic peak
potential (Epa) and cathodic peak potential
(Epc), as measured by CV, is found to
be −0.024 V for 2,7-AQDS (with 1 α-SO3H and
1 β-SO3H) and −0.066 V for 2-AQS (with 1 β-SO3H), respectively. This shows that substituting sulfonyl groups
onto the α and β positions and number can possibly change
significantly the redox potential of anthraquinone derivatives, which
will be further discussed in the following content. We also employed
the peak potential separation (ΔEp) values to evaluate the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction,
where a relatively small ΔEp corresponds
to excellent reversibility of the reaction.25,26 It
can be seen from Figure 4a that the potential and the current density of the oxidation–reduction
peaks for the five curves are all different, which indicates that
the type of substituent and the substitution position significantly
influence the electrochemical activity of the anthraquinone compounds.
The results are presented in Table S2.
According to that, the current densities of the oxidation and reduction
peaks for the pristine GF in the 2-AQS solution is 1.521 and 1.793
mA cm–2, respectively, and the ΔEp is 33.26 mV. The maximum is 74.1 mV. Therefore, both
the catalytic activity and the reversibility of the pristine GF in
the 2-AQS solution are better than those in the other four anthraquinone
derivative solutions. To eliminate and estimate the influence of the
liquid phase mass transfer, linear sweep voltammetry measurements
of two anthraquinone derivatives (2-AQS and 1-AQS) at a rotating disk
electrode at various rotation rates were conducted. Figure 2b,c show the results of these
measurements.

Figure 2 (a) Cyclic
voltammograms of pristine GF, (b)
and (c) Linear sweep voltammetric data (scan rate of 5 mV s–1) at a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode for 1 mM concentration
of 2-AQS and 1-AQS at the rotation rates indicated.

The electrochemical activities of two anthraquinone
derivatives are evaluated using the Koutecky–Levich equation
(eq 1) to calculate the
kinetic current densities (Ik); the diffusion
current (Id) can be expressed by the Levich
equation (eq 2) 1   2   3  where I is the measured current
density; ω, the angular velocity of the disk (ω  =
 2πN, where N is the
electrode rotating speed); B, the Levich slope; n, the transferred electron number; F,
the Faraday constant (96 485 C mol–1); C0, the bulk concentration of anthraquinone derivatives; D0, the diffusion coefficient of anthraquinone
derivatives in the electrolyte, and υ, the kinematic viscosity.27Table 2 shows the experimentally obtained values. From Table 2, it can be observed that the
sulfonate groups occupy different positions on the anthraquinone skeleton,
and the diffusion coefficients of two anthraquinone derivatives differ
by about 1.5 times. However, its kinetic current densities differ
by a factor of eight. Therefore, in the CV diagram, the reason why
the peak current density of the 2-AQS is higher than that of the 1-AQS
can be attributed to the difference in electrochemical activity of
each derivative.

Figure 3a–d shows some parts of the representative cyclic voltammograms
of the seven pretreated GF electrodes in the five anthraquinone derivative
solutions. The electrochemical data from the cyclic voltammograms
of all the pretreated GF electrodes are listed in Tables S3–S7. By comparing the CV data (in Tables S3–S7), it can be found that the
performances of the seven pretreated GF electrodes are better than
that of the pristine GF. These data are larger than that reported
by Hukinson et al.9 using the glass carbon
electrode. In our work, the highest current density is ∼17.5
mA·cm–2, which is close to the performance
(about 20 mA·cm–2) of the CV curve reported
by Shah et al. for all vanadium RFBs.28 Therefore, we believe that the treated GF has a significant potential
to be applied in AORFBs. In addition, the first circle CV curve completely
coincided with the 20th circle CV curve, which indicates that the
surface functional groups and surface topography of the GF electrode
exhibit certain stability. However, long-term stability also requires
supplementary work for verification. In the different anthraquinone
derivatives, the order of the catalytic activity of the pretreated
GF is different. Among the above five solutions, the air-heat-treated
GF electrode showed the best catalytic activity. By comparing the
electrochemical activities and reversibilities for the same kind of
GF electrodes, such as the air-heat-treated GF electrode, in the five
kinds of anthraquinone derivative solutions, the observed electrochemical
activity in descending order was 2-AQS > 1-AQS > 2,7-AQDS >
AR ≈ 1,5-AQDS. The reversibility of the redox reaction of 1,5-AQDS
and AR solutions on the air-heat-treated GF electrode is poor. To
further verify the conclusions from the cyclic voltammograms and discuss
the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the pretreated GF electrode
in different anthraquinone derivative solutions, EIS was also carried
out.

3.2.2 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
As shown in Figure 4, it can be found that the Nyquist plot measured at the open-circuit
potential consists of two parts: a large semicircle in the high-frequency
range and a straight line in the low-frequency range. The semicircle
in high-frequency ranges indicates that the charge-transfer step takes
place at this potential. A straight line showing a typical diffusion
process gradually appears in the low-frequency range. This behavior
demonstrates that the electrode reaction is mix-controlled by the
charge-transfer step and diffusion step in the solution. From the
Bode diagrams of the pristine GF, two peaks located at log f ≈ 0.04 Hz and log f ≈ 2.0
Hz in the φ – log f plot can be observed.
This result means that the two-time constants should be included in
the equivalent circuits of the pristine GF. Batchelor-McAuley et al.
investigated the quantitative characteristics of the redox reaction
of 2,6-AQDS and 2-AQS over the full pH range and in the presence of
variable amounts of Na+ and K+ ions.29 They suggested that the electrochemical reduction
mechanism for the anthraquinone redox system is a CECE type mechanism,
where C means protonation and E is electron transfer.

equivalent circuits (g) used to simulate the EIS plots(f), points:
tested data, line: simulated results. The electrolyte solution contains
the 2-AQS. (h) Schematic diagram of electronic exchange for 2-AQS
on the graphite fiber.

Therefore, the electron-transfer
process of 2-AQS should be divided into two steps. In the first step,
a C=O unit on a special ring structure receives an electron,
and in the second step, another C=O unit gains an electron.30Figure 4g shows the equivalent circuits for the measured EIS plots,
where R1 accounts for the uncompensated
solution resistance from the reference electrode to the working electrode,
and R2 and CPE1 (constant phase
element) are ascribed to the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer
capacity of the first reduction step for 2-AQS on the pristine GF
electrode surface, respectively. R3 and
CPE2 are the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer
capacity of the second reduction step for 2-AQS, respectively. W is the Warburg impedance because of ion diffusion in solution
inside the GF. It can be found that the simulated curves (lines in Figure 4a–f) are consistent
with the measured data. From the fitted data in Table 3, it is found that the total resistance of
the GF decreases after different heat treatments. The total resistance
of the air-heat-treated 550 °C-3 h GF samples is the smallest,
which is in agreement with the observation that the peak current density
in the cyclic voltammogram is the largest. Sun et al.31 believed that the catalytic effect of heat-treated GF electrodes
on vanadium ions is mainly due to the C–OH content. This attribution
means that the increase in the C–OH content can improve the
hydrophilicity of the GF samples32 and
promote the reaction with the anthraquinone derivative, where the
specific reaction process is shown in Scheme 1.

Basically, the increase in the C–OH
content on the GF can help attract water molecules with the presence
of battery electrolyte solution, and wet the uncoated part of the
GF electrode.33 This generates a required
hydrophilic environment, presumably in the form of a double-layer
structure34 with inner-layer water molecules
adsorbed onto the uncoated area of the GF fiber surfaces. After replacing
the water molecules on the electrode surface, the organic molecules
are easily attached to the electrode surface. This will reduce the
electron transfer resistance, and increase the reaction rate with
H+, thus increasing the catalytic activity of the electrode.
We suggested that the electron transfer in electrochemical reactions
can be carried out in two ways. Figure 4h shows that the electrons of anthraquinone molecules
can be obtained by the connecting bonds between carbon atoms (A),
or by the electron tunneling effect of the second layer of graphite
laminates (B). Generally, the distance limit of the electron tunneling
effect is 1 nm, which is higher than the distance between the graphite
layers (0.355 nm). When the sp3 bonding is not favorable
for electron transfer in the redox reaction process, the electrons
required for the electrochemical reaction of anthraquinone can be
obtained by the electron tunneling effect. Therefore, beyond that,
we believed that in addition to a small fraction of organic molecules
that react with C–OH on the GF, most of the organic molecules
experienced catalysis directly via the GF electrodes. This means that
the electron transferability of the electrode can affect the reaction
rate of the organic molecules,35,36 and subsequently increased
the electrocatalytic activity of the GF to the anthraquinone derivatives.
Therefore, the abovementioned two aspects are the main reasons for
the improvement in the catalytic performance of the GF after heat
treatment.

In this work, further inspection shows that the Bode
plots shown in Figure 5 do not agree with the Bode plots shown in Figure 4. This result demonstrates that the reaction
mechanism of 2,7-AQDS is different from that of 2-AQS (Figure S3). The response reaction rate of this
side of the C=O unit is much slower than that of the other
side of the C=O unit. Therefore, in the equivalent circuit
diagram, there should be two parallel time constants, which represent
the reaction process of C=O on either side of the benzene ring.
For this reason, the equivalent circuit diagram shown in Figure 5g is used for fitting.
The simulated curves show consistent results with the measured data,
which indicated that the equivalent circuits shown in Figure 5g are suitable for describing
the electrochemical reaction processes of the four samples (A-500
°C-3 h, A-550 °C-3 h, A-600 °C-3 h, M-550 °C-3
h). In the equivalent circuit diagram (Figure 5g), the sum of R2 and R3 is considered as the total resistance
of the electrode. Table 4 shows the fitted values of the electrochemical impedance spectrum.
It can be seen that the GF sample subjected to air-heat treatment
at 550 °C for 3 h exhibits the smallest electrical resistance
and the best electrochemical performance.

To further investigate
whether the reaction mechanism of the GF electrode in different anthraquinone
derivatives is identical, the A-550 °C-3 h electrodes were chosen,
and their electrochemical impedance measurements in five anthraquinone
derivative solutions were obtained. Figure 6 shows that the Bode diagrams and the suitable
equivalent circuits in the five solutions are different. The results
obtained by the CVs and EIS indicate that the number and positions
of the substitutional functional groups on the anthraquinone backbones
affect not only the reaction rate but also the reaction mechanism.
Er et al.37 reported that the effects of
−CHO, −CN, −COOH, −COOCH3,
and −NO2 groups on increasing the redox potential
(E0) are increased when these groups are
substituted for the quinone hydrogens adjacent to the ketone units.
The functionalization of quinones with electron-withdrawing groups,
such as −SO3H, −PO3H2, and −NO2, exhibits an opposite effect and results
in high E0 values. The differences in
the reaction mechanisms are precisely due to the number and locations
of the substituents.

4 Conclusions
In this study, five types of anthraquinone
derivatives were used as electrolyte solutions. The modified GF samples
were used as the electrodes for CV and EIS. The effects of the substituents
and substitutions of the five anthraquinone derivatives on the electrochemical
properties of the cells were explored. The electrolyte solutions containing
the anthraquinone derivatives exhibited good overall reversibility;
however, disodium 9,10-anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate and alizarin
red exhibited poor reversibility. The result of electrochemical measurements
showed that the electrocatalytic activities of the anthraquinone derivatives
containing one sulfonate are better than those of the anthraquinone
derivatives containing two sulfonates, which are superior to that
of alizarin red. According to the redox reaction process using the
anthraquinone derivatives, two C=O groups on the benzene rings
in the anthraquinones react with two H+ in the solution
to generate two C–OH groups. The change in the type, number,
and position of the functional group of the anthraquinone derivatives
exerts a certain influence on the reaction process. When the number
of functional groups is increased or the substitution position is
closer to the C=O groups, a more pronounced hindrance in the
C=O reaction on the benzene ring is observed, and thus, the
electrocatalytic activity and reversibility decrease. On the basis
of all the test results of the five derivatives, the 2-AQS electrolyte
solution is the best electrolyte in terms of both the reversibility
and electrochemical performance.

With respect to the surface
treatment of GF, the effects of different heat treatment conditions
on the electrocatalytic activities of the GF electrodes were explored,
and air, vacuum, and a mixed air-vacuum were used to generate the
three types of GF modification methods. With respect to acid-treatment
methods, the electrocatalytic performance of the GF changed by soaking
it in pure concentrated sulfuric acid and by mixing concentrated sulfuric
acid with concentrated nitric acid at different volume ratios and
then soaking in the mixed liquor. Furthermore, the two methods of
mixed acid and mixed heating treatments were combined to explore the
influence of the mixed treatments on the electrocatalytic performance
of the GF. Finally, the surface of the GF was modified by nitrogen
doping. The results show that all the surface-treatment methods of
GFs are beneficial for improving their electrochemical performance.
Among the samples, the air-heat-treated GF samples exhibited the best
electrochemical performance. Studies of the morphology and crystal
structure of the GF samples after heat treatment with air showed that
the graphite surface of the GF sample was reduced and became smoother
after air-heat treatment, and that the lattice parameters of the carbon
fiber were reduced. This result shows that the air-heat-treatment
method will exfoliate the outer layer of the GF fiber at the pores
and destruction sites, which can improve the catalytic activity of
the GF electrode to some extent. According to the analysis of the
XPS results, the heat treatment process improves the surface of the
GF by increasing the content of C–OH functional groups. C=O
groups are beneficial for improving the electron-transfer capabilities
of the GF, and the C–OH groups are beneficial for improving
the catalytic performance of the oxidation–reduction reaction
with the hydrazine derivative electrolyte. The results of all the
tests show that the physical properties and electrochemical catalytic
performances of the GF samples are the best after air-heat treatment
at 550 °C for 3 h.
