Using
reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) as a multifunctional conductive
binder, a simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly approach
is developed to fabricate activated carbon/reduced graphene oxide
(AC/r-GO) composite electrodes for supercapacitors with outstanding
performance. In such a composite, r-GO provides several much needed
critical functions: r-GO not only serves as the binder material improving
the AC particle/particle cohesion and electrode-film/substrate adhesion
but also improves the electrical conductivity of the composite and
provides additional surfaces for ion adsorption. Furthermore, during
electrode fabrication, initial GO precursor functions as an effective
dispersant for AC, resulting in a stable electrode material slurry.
Employing characterization by advanced microscopy techniques, we show
that AC and r-GO assemble into an interconnected network structure,
resulting in a composite with high specific capacitance, excellent
rate capability, and long cycling life stability. Such high-performance
electrodes coupled with their relatively simple, scalable, and low-cost
fabrication process thereby provide a clear pathway toward large-scale
implementation of supercapacitors.

Introduction
One of the key challenges
in the 21st century is unquestionably
energy storage, where electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs),
also called supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, offer a promising,
low-cost, reliable, and environmentally friendly solution. Supercapacitors
feature fast charge–discharge capability, long lifecycles,
a wide range of operating temperatures, and operational safety and
represent an emerging class of power sources for portable electronic
devices.1 As the range of applications
of supercapacitors spans from digital cameras, mobile phones, to hybrid
vehicles, improving their performance, especially the energy density
while maintaining the high power density and cycling stability, remains
a primary research focus in the field. Because electrode materials
are the key components to the performance of supercapacitors, rationally
designing and fabricating high-quality electrode materials play a
decisive role in developing next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.2−4

In the industrial cell-manufacturing processes, supercapacitor
electrodes are cast onto a current collector from slurries that contain
the active electrode material. Today, virtually all industrial supercapacitor
manufacturers use coconut shell-derived activated carbon (AC) as the
active electrode material due to its high surface area and porosity,
stability during cycling, and low cost.5 However, AC alone cannot maintain the required electrical conductivity
and mechanical stability of the electrode, and hence electrode slurries
generally are also added to the binder system, which maintains both
electrical and mechanical integrity of the electrodes once casted
on to the current collector. Traditional binder systems are dual-component
based, typically a polymer binder and a conductive additive, for two
different functionalities. The organic polymer binder, such as poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF),6,7 poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE),8−10 and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC),11−13 is used to maintain
the cohesion between AC particles and the adhesion of electrode film
to the current collector. Conductive additives, such as carbon black
(CB), are added to improve the conductivity of the electrode and hence
the high rate performance of the supercapacitor. However, the organic
polymer binders, themselves, are nonconductive and electrochemically
inert, thus making no contribution to the total capacitance of the
device. Therefore, they not only increase the electrical resistance
of the electrode but also increase the “dead” weight
of the electrode, which ultimately reduces the overall energy and
power densities of the supercapacitor. Furthermore, in realizing greener
processes for electrode fabrication, there is a need for replacing
fluorine-containing binders such as PVDF and PTFE due to their environmental
impact.14,15 On the other hand, addition of conductive
additives, such as carbon black, may partly alleviate the problem
of electrical conduction but can only establish electrical connection
through a percolating point-to-point contact and also decreases the
tensile strength and extensibility of the binders.7 Based on the above facts, an ideal binder material should
be adhesive, electrically conductive, light, electrochemically active,
and additionally form stable electrode slurries.

Although the
role of the binder system is as important as that
of the active material itself, in supercapacitor research, binders
have received the least attention to date. Although several studies
have tried to overcome the drawbacks of the binder systems by preparing
binder-free self-standing thin film16−26 or aerogel electrodes,27−29 they are only compatible to an
limited extent with large-scale electrode fabrication in industrial
supercapacitor manufacturing processes.15 In contrast, the development of a monolithic binder material that
intrinsically combines electrical conductivity and mechanical integrity
by holding AC particles together and further bonding the electrode
film to the current collector, while itself also acting as an electrochemically
active double-layer material, remains strongly underdeveloped in the
literature.30−32

Addressing the aforementioned issues, herein
we present a rational
method to fabricate AC-based supercapacitor electrodes, in which we
introduce reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) as a highly efficient, monolithic,
conductive binder material, which holds individual AC particles into
a compact electrode layer adhered on to the current collector. Our
approach synergistically combines mechanical integrity with good electrical
conduction between AC particles, with the added benefit that r-GO
also additionally serves as an active electrochemical double-layer
material itself, thus circumventing a dead weight effect. Thereby,
r-GO as a binder in AC supercapacitor electrodes enables much enhanced
capacitance performance, rate capability, and cycling life stability
compared to conventional dual-component organic polymer/conductive
additive binder systems. Importantly, we link this enhanced performance
to a comprehensive materials characterization of our novel AC/r-GO
composite electrodes, thus developing an extendible framework toward
optimization of multifunctional monolithic binders for supercapacitors.

Results
For the preparation of the electrode material layer composed of
r-GO and AC particles, a commercially available supercapacitor grade
coconut shell AC (YP-50F from Kuraray Chemicals) was used. Graphene
oxide (GO), synthesized by oxidizing vein graphite following Hummer’s
method,33 was used as the starting material
of the r-GO. A well-dispersed mixture of GO and AC in propylene carbonate
(PC) was coated onto the Al current collector and GO within the electrode
material was converted into r-GO by low-temperature thermal reduction.
The initial ratio of GO to AC was set to 1:10 by weight. Weight ratio
of r-GO to AC in the electrode layer obtained after the electrode
layer is applied on to the current collector and the reduction is
performed is about 0.65:10 by weight. This is because the weight of
the starting GO is reduced by about 35% (from thermogravimetric analysis
of GO) during the reduction of the graphene oxide due to the removal
of oxide groups.2,34,35 Other weight ratios of GO to AC examined were 10:1, 1:1, and 1:20.
For 10:1 and 1:1 weight ratios, the electrochemical performance of
the resulting supercapacitors was lower than that for 1:10 weight
ratio. For 1:20, the binding between the current collector and the
electrode layer and binding between AC particles were poor.

To evaluate the electrochemical performance of AC/r-GO composite
electrodes, symmetric two-electrode supercapacitors were fabricated
with tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) dissolved
in PC as the electrolyte (referred as AC/r-GO supercapacitor). To
facilitate direct comparisons, two comparative reference supercapacitors
were prepared with electrodes composed of (a) a conventional organic
binder, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), with AC (1:10), referred
to as AC/CMC, and (b) the conventional dual-component binder system
CMC and carbon black (CB) with AC (1:1:10), referred to as AC/CMC/CB.
For details on materials and methods see the Supporting Information. For further comparisons, the electrochemical performance
of a supercapacitor prepared with pure r-GO measured under the same
conditions is also given in the Supporting Information (referred to as r-GO supercapacitor) (Supporting Information Figure 1).

Figure 1a shows
the cyclic voltammograms (CV) for the AC/r-GO supercapacitor cycled
between −2.5 and +2.5 V at scan rates 50, 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1500 mV/s. Near-rectangular CV
curves at all scan rates from 50 to 1500 mV/s with no major pseudocapacitance
contribution indicate the ideal double-layer capacitor behavior (also
see Supporting Information Figure 2). Additionally,
the AC/r-GO electrode is robust enough to be charged and discharged
over a wide range of scan rates (50–1500 mV/s) and still maintains
its nearly ideal rectangular CV shape. Based on the area of the CV
curve, we calculated the specific capacitance of the AC/r-GO supercapacitor
as 77.6 F/g at 50 mV/s, and as the scan rate increases to 1500 mV/s,
it retains 60.3 F/g with a capacitance retention ratio of 78% (Figure 1d). In contrast,
the comparative supercapacitors exhibit lower specific capacitances
of 60.3 F/g (AC/CMC) (Figure 1b) and 68.9 F/g (AC/CMC/CB) (Figure 1c) at 50 mV/s with capacitance retention
ratio of only 55 and 58%, respectively, at 1500 mV/s (Figure 1d). Markedly distorted CV curves
of AC/CMC (Figure 1b) and AC/CMC/CB (Figure 1c) supercapacitors at higher scan rates are a further evidence
of their poorer rate capability.

of that device at 2 A/g. (g) Nyquist plots for the AC/r-GO, AC/CMC,
and AC/CMC/CB supercapacitors using a sinusoidal signal of 10 mV over

and evolution of the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of AC/r-GO
electrochemical capacitor: the capacity retention rate (normalized
to the initial capacitance) and increase in ESR (normalized to the
initial ESR) for 20 000 cycles of charge–discharge tests.

Galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements at varying current
densities further illustrate the excellent rate performance of the
AC/r-GO electrodes. The specific capacitance, at 2 A/g, was estimated
as 79.8 F/g for the AC/r-GO supercapacitor and is thereby higher than
57.5 F/g for the AC/CMC and 66.0 F/g for the AC/CMC/CB supercapacitors
(Figure 1e). In addition,
the sharp response and a small voltage drop (0.048 V) at the start
of the discharge curve are indicative of the formation of an efficient
EDL and fast ion transport within the AC/r-GO electrodes. The linear
time dependence of the potential suggests the absence of major Faradic
processes due to functional groups remaining on r-GO. As the current
density increases from 2 to 5 A/g, the AC/r-GO supercapacitor consistently
exhibits a higher specific capacitance and shows little change (4.8%)
with increase in operating power compared to significant drop in the
performance of the comparative counterparts (13.6 and 12.8% for AC/CMC
and AC/CMC/CB, respectively) (Figure 1f).

The facilitated ion transport within the
AC/r-GO electrodes can
also be confirmed from the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).
A complex plan plot of the impedance data of AC/r-GO along with comparative
cells is shown in Figure 1g over the frequency range from 0.01 to 100 000 Hz.
An expanded view of the high-frequency region is provided in the inset.
The AC/r-GO supercapacitor gives the smallest high-frequency semicircle,
indicating the smallest electrode–electrolyte charge transfer
resistance. The small charge transfer resistance indicates a very
fast charge-transport rate, which is in good agreement with CV and
high current charge–discharge studies.36

Furthermore, AC/r-GO also demonstrated excellent cycling stability
with ∼80% capacitance retention over 20 000 charge–discharge
cycles (Figure 1h),
indicating a robust architecture of the electrode material. At the
same time, ESR slowly increases during cycling.37

The electrochemical characterization results have
shown excellent
electrochemical response of the AC/r-GO electrodes compared to the
comparative electrodes in terms of charge–discharge capacity,
rate capability, and cyclic performance. To link this superior electrochemical
performance of the novel AC/r-GO composite with its nano- and microstructure,
the composite is characterized using different complementary methods
in the following paragraphs.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the AC/r-GO composite
electrodes indicate a good homogeneity of the AC/r-GO composite surface
on a micrometer scale (Figure 2a,b). At higher magnification (Figure 2c), a composite structure of particulate
features that are wrapped by sheets of partly electron transparent
material is observed. The particulate features are ascribed to the
AC particles and the wrapping sheets to the r-GO. It is important
to note that hardly any unwrapped AC particles are observed on the
electrode surface, suggesting a good interconnection of the AC grains
with the r-GO sheets. The absence of charging during the SEM imaging
indicates that the network of AC/r-GO is electrically conductive.
Both observations are consistent with the good electrochemical performance
of the AC/r-GO composites.

Figure 2 SEM images of the AC/r-GO electrode material
at different magnifications,
(a) 10 μm, (b) 1 μm, and (c) 300 nm scalebars.

To confirm the intimate contact of AC and r-GO
in the electrode,
the morphological and structural features of the AC/r-GO composite
were further examined using (scanning) transmission electron microscopy
((S)TEM). For this purpose, a as-fabricated electrode (from a working
electrode batch) was scratched off the Al current collector and the
resulting material was deposited onto amorphous carbon TEM grids with
regular hole arrays. TEM images at intermediate magnifications of
the thus-obtained specimen (Figure 3a,b) show an isolated AC particle, which is covered
by an r-GO sheet. The edges of the AC particle present the typical
highly porous structure of AC38−40 (Figure 3b) and the r-GO sheet is seen to intimately
fold around the AC particle, consistent with the SEM results. The
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in (Figure 3c,d) correspondingly indicates
two superimposed phases with graphitic structure:41 one phase with higher graphitization and a partial in-plane
orientation (hexagonal spot pattern, white arrows), which we ascribe
to the r-GO sheet, as well as another phase with lower graphitization
and random orientation of nanocrystallites (rings in pattern), which
is ascribed to the AC particle.

SAED pattern (d) of AC/r-GO
composite. The bright field image corresponding to the SAED pattern
in (d) is given in (c). Annular dark field detector STEM images (e,
f) of r-GO layers in the AC/r-GO composite. The blow-up (g) of the
monolayer region in (f) has been Gaussian blurred and medium filtered.

Aberration-corrected STEM elucidates
the structure of the r-GO
sheets with atomic resolution. In the STEM images (Figure 3e,f), r-GO flakes are found
to be typically comprised of few layers of r-GO that are partly turbostratically
restacked. Monolayer r-GO regions generally show a hexagonal “honeycomb”
lattice, albeit with extensive disorder (Figure 3g), which is fully consistent with previous
reports on the atomic structure of r-GO.42,43 Successful formation of r-GO in the composite from the GO precursor
is further confirmed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) measurements and
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurement of the
AC/r-GO composites and its individual components (Supporting Information Figures 3 and 4).

Conductive tip atomic
force microscopy (c-AFM) was used to further
evaluate the topography of the AC/r-GO composite and the homogeneity
of its electrical conductivity.45−47 Topography AFM images (two-dimensional
(2D) and three-dimensional (3D)) (plots) and the corresponding c-AFM
current maps of an as-fabricated AC/r-GO electrode are shown in Figure 4. The observed topography
of the AC/r-GO composite (Figure 4a,b) is found to be in good agreement with the SEM
observations above (Figure 2). Global height variations on a low-micrometer scale are
found with smaller local variations in the nanometer range. The latter
are ascribed to the wrinkling of r-GO sheets and AC particle protrusions.
Importantly, the current map (at 1 V bias) in Figure 4c indicates a homogeneous electrical conductivity
of the AC/r-GO composite over micrometer lateral length scales, which
are consistent with measurements over several AC grains. In particular,
no regions with significantly reduced electrical conductivity are
observed. This suggests that the r-GO binder successfully electrically
connects the individual AC particles and prevents particle isolation.
The very small spread in the histogram over the measured current values
(Figure 4d) further
confirms this. Consistent with electrochemical characterization and
the electron microscopy data above, the AC/r-GO electrodes are thus
found to be homogeneously electrically conductive and r-GO is thereby
identified as an efficient conductive binder material for AC.

shows the c-AFM measurement geometry. We note here however that c-AFM
probes the electrodes in a dry state and not under electrochemical
conditions44 and can thus only assess the
electrodes’ conductivity in a semiquantitative manner, but
it cannot elucidate the electrochemical transfer resistances and transport
mechanisms relevant for a working supercapacitor device.

Discussion
In addressing the shortcomings
related to conventional binder systems
in supercapacitors, we introduced r-GO as a monolithic multifunctional
conductive binder that can replace the conventional dual-component
binder system in facile, solution-based electrode coating or printing
(on to current collector) process to realize large-scale and low-cost
EDLCs. The near-rectangular CV curves of the AC/r-GO electrodes, even
at an ultrafast scan rate of 1500 mV/s, linear voltage–time
profile, and the highly symmetric charge–discharge characteristics
indicate a fast charge propagation and an efficient EDL formation
within the AC/r-GO structure. This high-power capability along with
excellent cycling stability clearly highlights the superior supercapacitive
performance of the AC/r-GO electrodes. Energy density and power density
of supercapacitors are also important parameters for their real-life
applications.1 For our devices with AC/r-GO
as the electrodes, in the TEABF4/PC electrolyte system,
a power density of about 134 kW/kg was achieved with an energy density
of 17 Wh/kg (specific capacitance of 76 F/g) at the current density
of 5 A/g (see the Supporting Information for calculations). Under the same conditions, AC/CMC gave a power
density of 21 kW/kg and an energy density of 11 Wh/kg (specific capacitance
of 49 F/g), whereas those for AC/CMC/CB were 33 kW/kg and 13 Wh/kg
(specific capacitance of 58 F/g). Whereas the power density of comparative
supercapacitors, AC/CMC and AC/CMC/CB, remains close to the range
for normal AC supercapacitors with conventional binder systems26,29,48 (5–20 kW/kg), that of
AC/r-GO devices is far beyond this range.

To further compare
these values with the literature data for monoblock
electrodes (Figure 5) such as self-standing thin films and aerogels developed with the
purpose of overcoming the drawbacks of conventional binders, the power
density of our AC/r-GO supercapacitors is much higher than the maximum
power density of 5.1 kW/kg reported for a graphene paper electrode
pillared by carbon black nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte,16 the power density of 7.3 kW/kg for AC/carbon
nanotube paper electrode in aqueous electrolyte,26 and that of 6.2 kW/kg obtained for composite organogels
of r-GO and AC in organic electrolyte of TEABF4/PC.29 Moreover, we compare the power density of AC/r-GO
devices with that of other composite electrodes based on carbon spheres
and r-GO prepared using conventional binders (Figure 5). Power densities of 4.2, 10, and 15.4 kW/kg
have been reported for 3D hierarchical composite electrode of slightly
crumpled r-GO sheets intercalated with mesoporous carbon spheres (prepared
using PTFE) in an aqueous electrolyte,49 for an electrode of r-GO/AC (prepared using PTFE) in ionic liquid
electrolyte,50 and a nanostructured electrode
comprising functionalized carbon spheres and r-GO sheets (prepared
using PTFE) in aqueous electrolyte, respectively,51 again confirming the high-power delivery of the AC/r-GO
electrodes.

Figure 5 Performance comparison of various supercapacitors monoblock electrodes
and electrodes with conventional binders with the AC/r-GO composite
electrodes. Each number corresponds to the reference from which the
data on power and energy density were extracted. Data of this work
were obtained from AC/r-GO supercapacitor and comparative supercapacitors,
AC/CMC and AC/CMC/CB, in TEABF4/PC electrolyte solution.

The excellent electrochemical
performance of our AC/r-GO electrodes
stems from the role r-GO plays within the composite as well as the
highly interconnected 3D structure that favors fast charge transportation
of the electrode layer. In general, this is shown schematically in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Schematic illustration
of the AC/r-GO electrode.

r-GO is well-known for its outstanding electrical conductivity
and high surface area for ion adsorption.52,53 When processed properly, these useful properties can be harnessed
and such a structure provides many benefits for the improvement of
energy storage applications. Within the AC/r-GO composite, r-GO has
several critical functions for efficient use of AC for energy storage;
r-GO facilitates the mechanical connection among AC particles in the
electrode, serves to enable the mechanical integrity of electrode
layer and its adhesion to the current collector and provides additional
surface for EDL ion adsorption, and finally/hence replaces the need
for conductive additives by improving the electrical conductivity
of the composite.

Comprehensive materials characterization of
our AC/r-GO electrodes
clearly highlights the highly interconnected 3D structure of the composite.
The r-GO layers are capable of surface contact with AC particles with
low contact resistance, as shown here by our combination of SEM, TEM,
and c-AFM. Conductive r-GO layers that wrap around AC particles three-dimensionally
not only provide additional electron transport pathways but also decrease
the ion diffusion length that favors fast charge transportation resulting
in high rate performance. Furthermore, holes created on the r-GO sheets
due to the removal of in-plane C atoms during the reduction process
may provide cross-plane diffusion channels for electrolyte ions.54,55 Functioning as the ion diffusion shortcuts between different layers
of graphene, they greatly speed up the ion transport across the entire
electrode film. In sharp contrast, in conventional binder systems,
nonconductive polymers and conductive carbon particles that make electrical
connection through a percolating point-to-point contact cause greatly
retarded mass transfer and thereby place limitations on the high-power
performance of EDLCs. (As a result, the CV curves of such electrodes
distort with increasing sweep rate, as also seen here for the conventional
r-GO-free comparative supercapacitors.)

Functional groups remaining
on the r-GO layers after reducing at
300 °C, such as carbonyls, ethers, and phenols,56,57 play a key role in determining the adhesive properties of r-GO as
the layers make surface contact with AC particles and the current
collector (Supporting Information Figure 4). The noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding and π–π
interactions), which are established between r-GO layers themselves,
and between r-GO and AC particles and current collector, assist r-GO
to maintain the structural stability of the electrode as the binder
material, by keeping the AC particles bound together on to the current
collector. This is consistent with the reports that polymers with
high adhesive properties, such as alginate and poly(acrylic acid),
form strong hydrogen bonds with the oxide surface on the active materials.58 Also, incorporation of such noncovalent interactions
is expected to be a useful tool in tuning network properties between
binder polymers and active particles.59,60 Additionally,
they have been seen to improve the cycling stability of the electrodes.58 Moreover, these functional groups are also beneficial
to the superior supercapacitive performances by improving electrolyte
wettability and electrical conductivity.61 The unique combination of adhesive, conductive, and high surface
area properties of r-GO into a single electrode results in excellent
electrochemical performance for AC/r-GO supercapacitors.

In
addition, from the perspective of the electrode fabrication
process, the initial GO precursor, which is present in the electrode
slurry, functions as an effective dispersant for AC in PC, resulting
in a stable electrode material slurry that facilitates the electrode
film fabrication. We find that the AC/GO slurry in PC can be applied
to a collector uniformly so as to form a smooth layer on the collector,
which contains the active substance in a uniform composition. This
is consistent with previous reports on GO as an excellent two-dimensional
polymeric dispersing agent for dispersion of various carbon-based
materials.62−64

Conclusions
Development of an efficient
binder system is a frequently overlooked
bottleneck in realizing high-performance supercapacitors. In conventional
methods of electrode fabrication, dual-component conductive additive–polymer
binder system is added to improve the electrode stability at the expense
of electrical conductivity and capacitance/weight ratio of the electrode.
Therefore, a binder material that combines mechanical stability, high
electrical conductivity, and significant ion-adsorption capability
and can also disperse the active materials and stabilize them during
solution-based electrode fabrication is urgently needed. This study
reported the use of r-GO as such an ideal binder for AC-based high-power
supercapacitor electrodes. With its adhesive and conductive properties
and high surface area, r-GO serves as a single-component conductive
binder with multifunctionality to maintain high electronic conductivity
and mechanical adhesion while functioning as an electrochemically
active material for charge storage. Its electrochemical properties
were demonstrated by the outstanding performance of the AC/r-GO composite
electrodes prepared without any additional polymer binders or conductive
additives. The specific capacitance of the AC/r-GO electrodes increased
by ∼20–38% at 2 A/g compared to comparative supercapacitors,
with power density values as high as 134 kW/kg at 5 A/g. These AC/r-GO
composite electrodes exhibit excellent cycling performance with 80%
capacitance retention over 20 000 charge–discharge cycles.
SEM, TEM, STEM observations, and c-AFM measurements together demonstrate
structurally and electrically interconnected and homogeneous “wrap
around” structure of AC/r-GO composites, linking the superior
electrochemical performance to the microstructure of the AC/r-GO composites.
The initial GO precursor, which is present in the electrode slurry,
also functions as an effective dispersant for AC, resulting in stable
electrode material slurry during solution-based electrode fabrication.
Importantly, such a facile solution-based process combined with electrode
coating or printing on to current collector provides a practical route
for making large-scale and low-cost devices.65 This combination of unique properties makes the reported monolithic
multifunctional r-GO binder suitable for significantly enhancing the
power capacity of industrial-type AC supercapacitors used in applications
such as electric vehicles.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of AC/r-GO
Electrodes and Supercapacitors
Graphene oxide (GO), synthesized
using graphite oxide derived from
vein graphite (purity >99%, Bogala Graphite, Sri Lanka) following
Hummers’ method,33 is used as the
starting material of the reduced graphene oxide (r-GO), which serves
as the multifunctional binder and conductive additive in the electrode
composite. The as-synthesized graphite oxide was washed with a diluted
HCl solution to completely remove residual salts. It was further washed
with water until the pH of the rinse water became neutral (pH = 7).
Ultrapure Milli-Q water was used in all the experiments. The as-purified
graphite oxide suspensions were then dispersed in water. The exfoliation
of graphite oxide to GO was achieved by ultrasonication of the dispersion.
Graphene oxide dispersions prepared according to the above procedure
were dried in an oven maintained at a temperature of 50 °C. Completely
dried GO was used for further characterization and supercapacitor
electrode fabrication. As produced, completely dried GO was characterized
using different complementary methods2 and
used for activated carbon (AC)/r-GO electrode fabrication. The results
clearly confirmed the successful fabrication of GO decorated with
hydroxyl, carbonyl, ether, and carboxyl groups, which in its restacked
dried form keeps an interlayer distance of ∼0.79 nm.

A commercially available, supercapacitor grade, steam-activated,
coconut shell AC (YP-50F from Kuraray Carbons, surface area in the
range of 1500–1800 m2/g, pore volume 0.7 cm3/g and ash content <1%) was used as received without further
processing to prepare the composite.

For supercapacitor electrode
fabrication, GO and AC were mixed
in propylene carbonate (PC) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.7%) to prepare a slurry.
The investigated ratios by weight of GO to AC were 10:1, 1:1, 1:10,
and 1:20, where the best supercapacitor performance was observed for
1:10. The mixed solution was sonicated for further dispersion of GO
and the electrodes were prepared by slurry casting onto conductive
coated Al current collector. The AC/GO composite coated on the current
collector was heated at 300 °C in an inert (Ar) atmosphere, at
low pressure (1 kPa) for 30 min to convert the GO within the composite
electrode material into r-GO. Electrodes from GO/AC mixtures of 10:1,
1:1, and 1:10 were structurally stable after electrode fabrication
and reduction. For 1:20, the binding between current collector and
the electrode layer and binding between AC particles were poor.

Fabrication of Comparative Supercapacitors
Comparative
supercapacitors were fabricated in a manner similar to that of the
above-described test supercapacitor with AC/r-GO composite electrodes
(referred as AC/r-GO supercapacitor).

For comparison, the following
supercapacitors electrodes were fabricated:1. Electrodes having an electrode material
layer composed of the AC and sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC,
Sigma-Aldrich, average molecular weight (Mw) ∼90 000), which is a conventional binder, instead
of r-GO obtained by reducing GO (referred as AC/CMC supercapacitor),
with the weight ratio of CMC/AC = 1:10.

2. Electrodes having an electrode material
layer composed of the AC and sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC)
and carbon black (CB, Cabot Corporation), which is a conventional
conductive additive, instead of r-GO obtained by reducing GO (referred
as AC/CMC/CB supercapacitor), with weight ratio of CB/CMC/AC = 1:1:10.

3. Electrodes having an electrode
material
layer composed only of r-GO obtained by reducing GO under the same
reduction conditions used for the reduction of GO in the AC/GO composite
(referred as r-GO supercapacitor).



Materials Characterization
The structure of AC/r-GO
composite was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Hitachi S-5500), conductive tip atomic force microscopy (c-AFM,
NT-MDT NTEGRA Spectra66 with NT-MDT DCP
20 tips, measured in contact mode), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, Philips CM200 at 200 kV, bright field TEM and selected area
electron diffraction (SAED)), and scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM, aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM 100 at 60 kV, medium angle
annular dark field imaging). For TEM and STEM, the examined material
was obtained directly from an as-fabricated AC/r-GO composite electrode
coated on Al foil (from a working electrode batch). The composite
was manually scratched off the Al foil and the thus-obtained material
was dispersed in isopropyl alcohol, and then via drop cast transferred
to TEM grids (Quantifoil holey amorphous carbon). For SEM, the electrode
was used as it is without any further processing.

Electrochemical
Testing
The electrochemical behavior
of the as-prepared composite electrodes was characterized by cyclic
voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with two symmetric
electrodes in coin cell geometry using an Autolab electrochemical
interface instrument (PGSTAT 302N). A solution of 1M TEABF4 (Sigma) in PC (Sigma) was used as the electrolyte and a filter paper
(Whatman, grade no. 1) was used as the separator. The coin cell preparation
was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox (MBraun) with oxygen
and moisture levels of <1 ppm. The electrochemical measurements
were taken using a two-electrode system at ambient temperature.

Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was conducted between
the potential limits of 0 to +2.5 V at different current densities
(2, 3, 4, and 5 A/g) based on the total mass of active materials.
The cell capacitance at different current densities was calculated
according to C = I/(Δv/Δt), where C is
the measured capacitance for the two-electrode cell (F), I is the constant discharging current (A), Δv is the voltage difference from 90 to 30% of the discharge voltage
range (V), and Δt is the time required to go
from 90 to 30% of the discharge voltage range (s).67

The CV curves were recorded in the potential range
from −2.5
to +2.5 V at different scan rates (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600,
700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1500 mV/s). The cell capacitance at different
scan rates was calculated according to the equation C = (∫IdV)/vV, where C is the cell capacitance (F), I is the
response current, V is the potential window, and v is the CV scan rate (mV/s).67

The specific capacitances were calculated from the following
equation.67  Specific capacitance Csp is the capacitance
per unit mass for one electrode, where C is the measured
capacitance for the two-electrode cell
(F) and m is the total mass of the active material
(g) in both electrodes. The multiplier of 4 adjusts the capacitance
of the cell and the combined mass of two electrodes to the capacitance
and mass of a single electrode.

Frequency response analysis
was carried out in the range of 0.01–100 000
Hz with a DC bias of 10 mV. Extrapolating the curve on the Nyquist
plot to intersect the X-axis yields ESR values.67

The power density of the AC/r-GO device
was calculated from the
galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different charge–discharge
current densities using the following formula17  where P is the power density
(kW/kg), ΔV is the operating voltage window,
and m is the total mass of the active material in
both electrodes. RESR is the internal
resistance of the device estimated from the voltage drop (IR drop) at the beginning of the discharge curve and calculated
from the change in voltage (Vdrop) divided
by the total change in the current applied67 using the formula  The energy density of the device was obtained
from the following formula17  where E is the energy density
(Wh/kg), Csp is the specific capacitance
(F/g), and ΔV is the operating voltage window.

The energy density (E) can also be obtained by
measuring the discharge time at a certain current density and calculated
according to the following equation.68
