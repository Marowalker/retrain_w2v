Effective
and facile electrochemical oxidation of chemical fuels
is pivotal for fuel cell applications. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic
oxidation of hydrazine on a citrate-capped Au-TiO2-modified
glassy carbon electrode, which follows two different oxidation paths.
These two pathways of hydrazine oxidation are ascribed to occur on
Au and the activated TiO2 surface of the Au-TiO2 hybrid electrocatalyst. This activation was achieved through molecular
capping of the Au-TiO2 surface by citrate, which leads
to favorable hydrazine oxidation with a lower Tafel slope compared
to that of the clean surface of the respective materials, that is,
Au and TiO2.

Introduction
Fuel cells, electrochemical
energy conversion devices, play a vital
role in overcoming the global energy crisis. Among the different types
of fuel cells, direct electrochemical oxidation fuel cells (DEOFCs)
render choices to employ various chemical fuels and usually demonstrate
high efficiencies.1−3 The performance of DEOFCs depends significantly on
the anode catalyst used for the oxidation of the chemical fuels. Therefore,
design and synthesis of an effective and efficient anode catalyst
are crucial to the performance of DEOFCs. Noble metals and their alloys
are extensively used as catalysts in DEOFCs.4,5 However,
the cost-ineffectiveness of noble metals is one of the main concerns
that limits their use as catalysts in DEOFCs for practical applications.
Thus, recent focus has been centered on designing the non-noble-metal
catalysts, including transition metal oxides. To achieve a high performance
or energy-efficient DEOFC, focus must be laid on the following major
aspects:6,7 first, design of a smart and tailored catalyst
with a low oxidation overpotential4,8 and, second,
the nature of the fuels, the electrolyte, and the pH.9 An ideal fuel should have a wide availability, low cost,
and low thermodynamic oxidation potential with a favorable reaction
mechanism and produce eco-friendly byproducts upon oxidation.8 There are several reports on water electrolysis
(water as fuel),10 direct methanol/ethanol
oxidation,11,12 and hydrazine oxidation.13,14 The use of water as a fuel (water electrolysis) is attractive; however,
water electrolysis suffers from complex kinetics of water oxidation
at the anode surface, which controls the overall reaction. Therefore,
researchers have also paid attention toward direct electrochemical
oxidation of alcohols (methanol/ethanol).15 However, electro-oxidation of alcohols produces carbonaceous species,
which poison the catalyst, leading to increased overpotentials.16 On the other hand, hydrazine is an attractive
fuel, with several merits, as follows: (i) direct hydrazine fuel cell
(DHFCs) generate environment-friendly products, such as N2 and H2O, which are neither greenhouse gases nor have
toxicity, (ii) they exhibit a theoretical electromotive force of 1.56
V, which is higher than that of other liquid or H2–air
fuel cells, and (iii) they produce high energies and power densities
compared with hydrogen fuel cells.2,17 However, hydrazine
is reported to be toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic.18−20 Its flashpoint and other risk factors can be avoided if suitable
conditions are perceived.21 For example,
anhydrous hydrazine has a lower flashpoint, which can be nullified
upon diluting in aqueous solution. A <29% hydrazine aqueous solution
does not show any flashpoint. Similarly, thermal ignition and other
toxicities can be handled with suitable precautions. To overcome the
aforementioned limitations associated with alcohol fuel cells, it
is desirable to explore and design new hybrid catalysts with higher
catalytic activities and reliabilities and utilize a fuel that does
not produce harmful byproducts.

Despite the toxicity issue,
hydrazine is still considered as an
attractive liquid fuel for the aforementioned reasons. In DHFCs, the
anode catalyst plays a crucial role in reducing the overpotential
and increasing the oxidation current density and thereby in increasing
the overall efficiency. Primarily, Pt- and Pd-based materials and
their alloys have been used as anode catalysts in DHFCs.22−24 To reduce the use of these expensive noble metals, studies have
been performed on making alloys or composites with non-noble metals,25 carbon-based materials,24,26 polymers,27,28 and oxides.29,30 Furthermore, non-noble metals and their alloys and complexes have
been studied for hydrazine oxidation.17,31−33 However, there are only a few studies in which oxides have been
used as the support material for the metal catalyst for electro-oxidation
of hydrazine.23,34 The use of oxides as a support
for the metal catalyst not only reduces the use of metals but also
increases the electroactive surface area. The main challenges for
DHFCs are to develop efficient electrocatalysts with a low hydrazine
oxidation potential and high current density. Surface functionalization
of nanomaterials is considered as an effective way to increase the
electrocatalytic properties.35−38 In particular, upon suitable functionalization, Au
nanoparticles (NPs) show improved CO2 and O2 reduction activities.37,38 On the other hand,
TiO2 is known to be a stable oxide primarily studied in
solar water splitting and photocatalysis, and its application in fuel
cells has not been studied in depth. In the present work, TiO2 is used as a support material to a Au electrocatalyst for
hydrazine oxidation and citrate is taken as a model molecule to functionalize
the Au and TiO2 surfaces to improve the electrocatalytic
activities. This is due to the fact that hydrazine is basic in nature
and therefore citrate capping of the catalyst surface is expected
to increase the active sites for hydrazine electro-oxidation through
known acid–base adduct formation.

Results and Discussion
Surface
Morphology of Au-TiO2 Nanocrystals (NCs)
Figure 1a shows
a representative field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
image of Au-TiO2 NCs. The FESEM image shows gray particles
assigned to TiO2 NCs with a size in the range of 70–100
nm across the diagonal, and finer bright Au NPs were found to be deposited
at the edges of the TiO2 NCs. The size of the TiO2 NCs and Au NPs was further measured by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Figure 1b shows
a representative TEM image of hybrid Au-TiO2 NCs. The TiO2 NCs are found to be primarily cuboid with three different
exposed facets, as discussed in detail earlier.39 Briefly, along [001], the top and bottom facets of the
cuboids are {001}, the sides are {100}/{010}, and the eight top and
bottom edges are {101} exposed facets. The size of the Au NPs varies
in the range of 10–30 nm. TEM analysis also clearly reveals
that the Au NPs were primarily deposited at the edges of the cuboid
TiO2 NCs upon ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. The UV
light irradiation induced creation of electron and hole pairs in the
faceted TiO2 NCs. The photoexcited electrons prefer to
accumulate in excess on the {101} facets of cuboid TiO2 NCs due to their reductive nature.39−41 These photoelectrons
on the {101} facets facilitate reduction of noble metal ions and their
nucleation as metal NPs on the same crystal facets.42 The notion of charge carrier separation is therefore utilized
here to deposit the Au NPs onto the reductive {101} facets of TiO2 NCs by UV light irradiation.41 However, fewer Au NPs were found to accumulate on the surface (not
at edges) of distorted and spherical TiO2 NCs. The citrate
capped on the TiO2 surfaces can also induce some of the
Au NPs to be deposited/stabilized on its surface.

Au-TiO2 NCs reveals selective photodeposition of Au NPs
at the edges of the TiO2 NCs.

Surface Composition of Au-TiO2 NCs
The surface
composition of the Au-TiO2 NCs was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The photoelectron peaks were calibrated with respect
to the C 1s binding energy (BE) at 284.5 eV. Figure 2a shows the surface survey XPS spectra of
bare cuboid TiO2 NCs and Au-TiO2 NCs. The survey
spectra reveal a much stronger C 1s feature for Au-TiO2 NCs than that for bare TiO2 NCs, indicating citrate capping
on the former. The features at lower binding energies (20–65
eV) in both the samples (not marked in Figure 2a) are assigned to O 2s, Ti 3p, and Ti 3s
(Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)). Figure 2b,c displays the
Ti 2p region spectra of TiO2 NCs and Au-TiO2 NCs, respectively. The two major photoelectron peaks of bare TiO2 NCs at BEs of 458.1 and 463.6 eV correspond to Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. The Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks are found to be shifted to 458.8 and
464.5 eV, respectively, for the citrate-capped Au-TiO2.
The shift in BEs can be attributed to the change in the surface chemistry
of TiO2 in the hybrid Au-TiO2 nanomaterial due
to citrate capping. In addition, the deposition of Au NPs onto TiO2, as revealed by the FESEM and TEM analyses, could further
facilitate such a shift in the BE. This is because of the fact that
the EF of Au is known to be lower (−5.5
eV) than that of TiO2 (−4.4 eV).43−45 Therefore,
electrons drift from TiO2 to Au in the case of Au-TiO2. This makes TiO2 slightly positively charged and
thus Ti 2p peaks at higher BE values for the Au-TiO2 NCs.
A marked shift in the BE is also observed for the O 1s of Au-TiO2 NCs as compared to that of bare TiO2 NCs, as shown
in Figure 2d,e. The
O 1s feature of bare TiO2 NCs (Figure 2d) can be deconvoluted into two peaks, a
strong peak at 529.1 eV and a weak peak at 530.3 eV, which are due
to the lattice oxygen (OL) and surface-adsorbed oxygenated
species (OS), such as —OH and H2O, respectively.
These two O 1s peaks are found to be shifted to 530.1 eV for OL and 531.7 eV for OS in the case of Au-TiO2 NCs (Figure 2e). In addition to the OS and OL peaks, the
Au-TiO2 NCs exhibit two additional O 1s peaks centered
at 532.9 and 534.3 eV, assigned to the surface-adsorbed citrate on
the TiO2 surface and Au, respectively, as displayed in Figure 2e. These two peaks
at 532.9 and 534.3 eV correspond to the Ti—OOC— (TiO2-citrate) and Au—OOC— (Au-citrate) bonding,
respectively. It is expected that the metallic Au NPs were capped
with more number of citrate groups than that on the TiO2 surface in the hybrid Au-TiO2 nanomaterial, which is
in accord with the O 1s XPS intensity of the carboxylate group (Figure 2e). The photoelectron
peaks of Au, that is, Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, were
found to be located at 84.4 and 88.1 eV, respectively, indicating
the metallic state of Au NPs in the hybrid Au-TiO2 sample.46,47

Electrochemical Hydrazine
Oxidation
The electrochemical
behavior of hybrid Au-TiO2 NC catalysts was studied using
a Bipotentiostat with a three-electrode system in a 0.1 M KOH solution
for hydrazine oxidation. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded
by varying the molar concentration of hydrazine in the range of 0–3
mM in 0.1 M KOH, as shown in Figure 3a. To study concentration-dependent hydrazine oxidation,
hydrazine was added gradually to the reaction mixture, stirred for
3 min, and then allowed to settle for another 5 min prior to each
CV measurement. Figure 3a displays two anodic peaks in the potential range of −0.4
to +0.6 V versus those for a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), suggesting
a two-step hydrazine oxidation process, unlike the single oxidation
peak observed with a Au catalyst.29 The
current densities of these two anodic peaks, denoted as Ipa 1 and Ipa 2, were found
to increase with an increase in the hydrazine concentration. The onset
potentials of Ipa 1 and Ipa 2 were observed at −0.35 and +0.2 V versus those
of the SCE, respectively. The difference between the onset potential
values of these two peaks was found to be quite large (0.55 V), indicating
a two-step oxidation. In addition, Ipa 1 is sharper and increases significantly compared to the increase
in Ipa 2, suggesting facile and favorable
oxidation kinetics involved at Ipa 1 compared
to that at Ipa 2. Without hydrazine, no
peak (Ipa 1) was observed at ∼−0.2
V (vs that for the SCE). On the other hand, a minor peak (Ipa 2) at ∼+0.35 V versus that for the
SCE can be attributed to the oxidation of the citrate capped on Au-TiO2. The CV plots also reveal a cathodic oxidation peak (Ipc 1) at +0.17 V versus that for the SCE, which
is assumed to be due to the oxidation of the adsorbed species onto
the catalyst surface that is formed during the anodic scan at Ipa 2 (discussed later). A lower onset potential
for hydrazine electro-oxidation determines the utility of the electrocatalyst
in practical applications. A detailed comparison of the hydrazine
oxidation onset potential and peak potential of Ipa 1 to those of different metal and metal-modified catalysts
is shown in Table 1. To understand the scan-rate dependence of different oxidation peaks over the hybrid Au-TiO2 nanomaterial, the scan rate was varied, keeping the hydrazine
concentration and other experimental conditions fixed. Figure 3b displays the scan-rate dependence
CVs for hydrazine oxidation (1 mM) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte over Au-TiO2. The peak currents (Ipa 1 and Ipa 2) were found to vary linearly with the square
root of the scan rate (Figure S2), suggesting
a diffusion-controlled process.

obtained by varying
the hydrazine concentration in the range of 0–3 mM at 50 mV/s.
(b) CVs in a 1 mM hydrazine solution at different scan rates (ν
= 10–200 mV/s). Ipa 1 is found
to shift toward a higher overpotential region for hydrazine oxidation
with an increase in concentration as well as with an increase in the
scan rate, whereas the peak position of Ipa 2 is found to be independent of the hydrazine concentration and
scan rate. All CVs were taken in a 0.1 M KOH solution with a given
hydrazine concentration.

To understand the two-step hydrazine
oxidation and to ensure the
role of Au-TiO2 NCs, hydrazine (2 mM) oxidation was performed
with bare TiO2 NCs and bare Au NPs, that is, without citrate
capping (Figure S3). The absence of any
oxidation/reduction peaks in the CV of the bare TiO2 NCs
suggests that they have no role in hydrazine oxidation (Figure S3a). On the other hand, the CV of the
Au NPs exhibits two anodic peaks at ∼−0.4 (Ipa 1) and +0.3 V (Ipa 2) versus
those for the SCE. The peak potential of Ipa 1 shifts toward a more negative value, that is, −0.4 V, for
the bare Au NPs as compared to −0.17 V versus that for the
SCE for citrate-capped Au-TiO2 NCs (Figure 3a). The higher overpotential of Ipa 1 for Au-TiO2 is due to its lower conductivity
than that of bare Au NPs. The Ipa 2 of
bare Au NPs is due to the oxidation of Au(0) to Au(III), which gets
reduced to Au(0) in the cathodic scan (Figure S3b).54 It is interesting to note
that the Au NPs deposited on TiO2 did not show surface
oxidation, that is, Au(0) to Au(III) in the potential range of −0.4
to 0.6 V versus that for the SCE. In contrast, despite the low overpotential
for hydrazine oxidation, bare Au showed surface oxidation. XPS analysis
revealed that citrate is bonded to both the Au and TiO2 surfaces in the hybrid Au-TiO2 nanomaterial. This citrate
capping is attributed to the two-step hydrazine oxidation on hybrid
Au-TiO2. To further ascertain the role of citrate capping,
hydrazine electro-oxidation was carried out with citrate-capped TiO2 NCs (Figure S4) and citrate-capped
Au NPs (Figure S5) separately under similar
conditions. It was found that citrate-capped TiO2 shows
negligible hydrazine oxidation, that is, Ipa 1 (in the range of −0.2 to 0 V vs that for the SCE). On the
other hand, oxidation peaks (Ipa 2 and Ipc 1) in both the anodic and cathodic scans
were observed in the range of +0.2 to +0.5 V versus those for the
SCE (Figure S4) with citrate-capped TiO2 NCs. It is to be noted that there was no peak in this range
for the bare TiO2 NCs (Figure S3a). This confirms the role of citrate capping on the Au-TiO2 NCs for Ipa 2 and Ipc 1 (Figure 3). The hydrazine attached to the citrate molecules is suggested
to be oxidized at a positive potential of +0.35 V versus that of the
SCE leaving aside carbonaceous impurities, which are oxidized during
the cathodic scan, such as that observed during alcohol oxidation.16 On the other hand, citrate-capped Au NPs showed
hydrazine oxidation at a higher overpotential of −0.24 V versus
that of the SCE (Figure S5) compared to
that of bare Au NPs at −0.4 V versus that of the SCE (Figure S3b).

The electro-oxidation mechanism
on the citrate-capped Au-TiO2 NCs can thus be described
as follows. The basic —NH2 moiety of hydrazine could
easily attach to one of the free
carboxylate groups of citrate capped either on the Au NP or TiO2 NC surface of the hybrid Au-TiO2, forming an acid–base
adduct. This acid–base adduct formation leads to a superior
hydrazine oxidation behavior of the citrate-capped Au-TiO2. The first anodic oxidation at a low overpotential (−0.35
V vs that of the SCE), that is, Ipa 1,
is proposed to occur with the hydrazine molecule bonded to the citrate
capped on the Au surface. Similarly, Ipa 2 is due to hydrazine oxidation through adduct formation with the
free carboxylate group of citrate bonded to the TiO2 surface
of Au-TiO2. A schematic diagram of these two different
hydrazine oxidation pathways over Au-TiO2 is shown in Figure 4. At −0.35
V versus that of the SCE, the oxidation of hydrazine occurs on the
Au surface, whereas at +0.2 V, hydrazine oxidation takes place on
the TiO2 surface of the hybrid Au-TiO2 system.
Therefore, the two different hydrazine oxidation peaks basically originate
through adduct formation, with the free carboxylate group of citrate
capped on the Au-TiO2 catalyst surface. The difference
in the oxidation potentials is due to the difference in the support
materials, that is, Au and TiO2 of Au-TiO2,
as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Schematic diagram of the two-step electrochemical hydrazine oxidation
over citrate-capped Au-TiO2. Citrate is bonded with both
the Au and TiO2 surfaces of Au-TiO2, as revealed
by XPS analysis. Path I shows the oxidation of hydrazine at an onset
potential of −0.35 V vs that of the SCE, which forms an adduct
with the free carboxylate group of citrate bonded with the Au surface
of Au-TiO2. Similarly, path II shows the oxidation of hydrazine
with an onset potential +0.2 V vs that of the SCE, which forms an
adduct with the free carboxylate group of citrate bonded with the
TiO2 surface of Au-TiO2.

Furthermore, we compared the mass activity and corresponding
Tafel
slope of bare Au NPs and citrate-capped Au-TiO2, as shown
in Figure 5. The peak
current, Ipa 1, is estimated to be 1.45
times higher for Au-TiO2 than that for the bare Au NPs,
as shown in Figure 5a. The higher peak current density, Ipa 1, of Au-TiO2 NCs is believed to be due to the facile
interaction of the hydrazine molecule with the carboxylate group of
citrate bonded with the Au NPs of Au-TiO2. This suggests
minimization of the use of Au by formation of a suitable composite/hybrid
for electrochemical hydrazine oxidation. Figure 5b displays the corresponding Tafel slopes
of the different hydrazine oxidation peaks. Ipa 1 exhibits a smaller Tafel slope value (38 mV/dec) on Au-TiO2 NCs, suggesting enhanced hydrazine oxidation kinetics than
that on bare Au NP surfaces (Tafel slope 126 mV/dec). However, Ipa 2 shows quite a high value of the Tafel slope
(408 mV/dec), which is due to the semiconducting nature of TiO2; therefore, charge transportation is poor from the citrate-bonded
hydrazine molecules through the TiO2 surface.

hydrazine in a 0.1 M KOH solution at 50 mV/s. (b) Corresponding Tafel
slopes of the Au NPs, and Ipa 1 and Ipa 2 of Au-TiO2, respectively. Ipa 1 exhibits quite a low Tafel slope for hydrazine
oxidation, indicating favorable oxidation kinetics.

Conclusions
Au NPs are majorly deposited
on the {101} reductive facets of TiO2 NCs through a simple
UV light-assisted photoreduction of
gold chloroauric acid. The surface of the Au-TiO2 NCs is
found to be capped with citrate molecules, as confirmed from the XPS
analysis. This citrate capping of Au-TiO2 played a key
role in the facile and enhanced hydrazine electro-oxidation by formation
of an acid–base adduct, that is, —NH2 (basic
moiety, nucleophile) of hydrazine and the —COO– (acidic, electrophile) group of citrate. Therefore, such an acid–base
adduct formation facilitates hydrazine oxidation. Citrate-capped Au
NPs of Au-TiO2 show a smaller Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec
that that of bare Au NPs (126 mV/dec), suggesting superior electrocatalytic
activity of the former. In addition, citrate-capped TiO2 contributes toward hydrazine oxidation, with a Tafel slope of 408
mV/dec. The present study on the in situ functionalization of Au-TiO2 with citrate is demonstrated as a key idea, which could be
broadened through molecular modification of nanomaterials to enhance
their performance in the field of catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) [99.999%],
tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAH) [(C4H9)4NOH in 0.1 M aqueous], diethanolamine (DEA), tris-sodium citrate
(Na3C6H5O7), isopropanol
(C3H7OH), and hydrazine (N2H4) were purchased from Merck, India. Gold chloroauric acid
(H2AuCl6·6H2O) was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich.

Synthesis
The faceted cuboid TiO2 NCs were
synthesized as reported elsewhere.39 Briefly,
1.0 mL (3 mmol) of TTIP was added to 40 mL of TBAH and DEA at ∼5
°C. The resulting solution was hydrothermally treated at 225
°C for 48 h. The powder precipitate product was cuboid TiO2 NCs. The Au NPs were then deposited onto the bare TiO2 NC surface by UV light-assisted reduction of gold chloroauric
acid. In a typical synthesis of hybrid Au-TiO2, 20 mg of
the cuboid TiO2 NCs was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled
water and irradiated under UV light for 3 h. Then, 10 mg of tris-sodium
citrate was added to the reaction mixture, followed by the addition
of gold chloroauric acid (15 mol %) in isopropanol. After the addition
of gold chloroauric acid, the white solution slowly turned into deep
violet, indicating nucleation of the Au NPs. The reaction mixture
was further irradiated under UV for 30 min. The resultant red solution
was then centrifuged to collect the solid product. The change in color
toward red indicates an increase in the size of the Au NPs and/or
aggregation. The solid product was washed several times with water
and ethanol and finally dried at 60 °C.

Characterization
The surface morphology and microstructure
of the products were examined using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA FESEM and TECNAI
G2 (FEI) TEM operated at 200 kV. XPS was carried out on a PHI 5000
VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe with a monochromatic Al Kα
source (1486.6 eV).

Electrochemical Hydrazine Oxidation
Electrochemical
hydrazine oxidation was carried out using a CHI 760D Bipotentiostat
(CH Instruments, Inc.) in a three-electrode system in 0.1 M KOH with
an electrocatalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE), Pt wire,
and SCE as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.
The catalyst slurry was prepared by adding 5 mg of Au-TiO2 NCs or Au NPs in 5 mL of Millipore water and then sonicating for
30 min. A 2% polytetrafluoroethylene solution (10 μL) was added
to the above slurry and sonicated for another 10 min. Then, 20 μL
of the slurry was coated onto the GCE by drop casting and dried overnight
under vacuum. The dried catalyst-modified GCE was tested for hydrazine
oxidation in freshly prepared 0.1 M KOH with different concentrations
of hydrazine. Prior to each sample loading, the GCE was cleaned by
sonicating in water and 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1
M KOH solutions successively, followed by electrochemical cleaning
through CV in a potential window of −1.0 to +1.0 V in 0.1 M
H2SO4.
