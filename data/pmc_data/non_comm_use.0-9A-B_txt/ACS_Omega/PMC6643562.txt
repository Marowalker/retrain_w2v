Fur-imine-functionalized
graphene oxide-immobilized copper oxide
nanoparticles (Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO) are synthesized and found to be
a cost-effective, efficient, and reusable heterogeneous nanocatalyst
for the preparation of pharmaceutically important xanthene derivatives
under greener solvent conditions. Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO exhibits excellent
result in the synthesis of xanthenes with reduced reaction time (25−50
min) and higher yields (up to 95%) and has a simple procedure, ease
of product separation, and no byproducts. Moreover, the nanocatalyst
has a Cu loading of 13.5 at. % over functionalized GO which is far
superior than the already known metal-based heterogeneous catalysts.
The newly synthesized catalyst has been characterized by various physiochemical
techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
energy-dispersive X-ray, Raman spectroscopy for structural characterization,
field emission scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy for morphological characterization. The catalyst
showed admirable recyclability up to five consecutive runs, and there
was no appreciable loss in catalytic efficiency.

1 Introduction
Xanthenes
have been classified as oxygen-containing molecular families,
found in natural products, synthetic bioactive substances, and fluorescent
dyes.1 The core structure of xanthene exhibits
a variety of physicochemical and pharmacological properties such as
antiviral,2 antibacterial,3 analgesic,3 antimalarial,4 antiinflammatory,5 and anticancer.6 Extensive literature
survey has devoted for various routes for the synthesis of xanthenes,
for example, sulfamic acid,7 pTSA,8 silica sulfuric acid,9 molecular iodine,10 TiO2–SO42–,11 NaHSO4–SiO2,12et cyanuric
chloride,13 amberlyst-15,14 acyclic acidic ionic liquids,15 core/shell Fe3O4@GA@isinglass,16 and boric acid.17 However, such a type of catalysts possesses some disadvantages like
prolonged work up, harsh reaction conditions, toxic solvents, sluggish
and low reaction yields, and so forth, which demands for further development
of a novel catalyst for xanthene synthesis with an easy, cost-effective,
energy-efficient, and greener method.

The advanced progress
of nanocatalysts in various organic transformations
got ample attention.18,19 However, the major problems with
nanocatalysts are their recovery and reusability. Therefore, a heterogeneous
nanocatalyst can address this problem as they can be easily separated
by different filtrations or centrifugation techniques. Graphene, an
allotrope of carbon, is one of the extensively investigated 2D materials
as the catalyst or support to various metal nanocatalysts exhibiting
excellent catalytic activity for different types of organic transformations.20,22 Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have excellent mechanical strength,
electron transport properties, large specific surface area, good
adsorption capacity, high chemical, and thermal stability.21−23 GO and its nanocomposites have a wide range of applications as catalysts,24−29 photocatalysts,30−32 energy storage,33 sensors,34−36 hydrogen storage,37 drug delivery,38 biomedical devices,39 super-capacitors,40,41 and waste water treatment.42,43 In the backdrop of their excellent synergistic action, GO-based
nanocatalysts are rationalized using nanoparticles (NPs) adorning
its surface for them to be used as heterogeneous catalysts to overcome
different economic and environmental problems.44 However, metal NPs over a solid support of GO are unstable
because of their high surface energy, which leads to irreversible
agglomeration and thus reduces the catalytic activity.45 In order to tackle this problem, silica modification
of GO worked as an outstanding protection strategy which prevents
the agglomeration of metal NPs and improves catalytic activity.46 Additionally, chemical modification of GO by
imine-functionalized silica increases surface donor sites which bind
strongly with metal cations at the surface of the catalyst, thus minimizing
the possibility of active metal sites leaching from the catalyst surface.47 In this article, we report for the first time
the synthesis of a new furfural (Fur) imine-functionalized APTES grafted
GO nanocatalyst immobilized with copper oxide NPs and its efficient
catalytic activity for one-pot synthesis of xanthene derivatives under
greener solvent conditions. A schematic diagram showing the synthetic
procedure of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO is illustrated in Scheme 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction and Raman Studies
The crystallographic
structure and chemical composition of the so
formed GO, APTES/GO, Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, and recovered Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and XRD patterns
are shown in Figure 1i. GO shows its characteristic peaks at 2Θ = 10.3 attributing
to plane ⟨001⟩ and at 2Θ = 42.5 representing the
⟨100⟩ plane. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of fresh Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
and recovered Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO after catalysis show peaks at 2Θ
= 35.3 and 38.47 attributing to plane ⟨002⟩ and ⟨111⟩
of CuO, respectively, which is in correlation with the literature
values.48 Peak at 2Θ = 10.3 in the
XRD pattern disappeared owing to functionalization of APTES on GO
along with conversion of GO to reduced GO and a very broad pattern
is observed around 2Θ = 22.49 Raman
spectra for GO, APTES/GO, fresh Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, and recovered
Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO catalyst are shown in Figure 1ii depicting the characteristic D and G band
of graphene. The D band of graphene is because of the breathing mode
of sp3-bonded carbon A1g symmetry j-point phonons in disordered graphene, whereas the G band represents
sp2-bonded carbon atom associated first order scattering
of E2g phonons.The Raman spectrum for GO displayed D and
G bands at 1350 and 1594 cm–1, respectively. Similarly,
the D band for APTES/GO, fresh Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, and recovered
Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO has been observed at 1341, 1347, and 1347 cm–1, respectively, whereas the G band appeared at 1596,
1595, and 1596 cm–1, respectively. The ID/IG ratio that is, the intensity
ratio of D and G bands reflects the disorderness of graphitic carbon
in the nanocatalyst. In the present case, the ID/IG ratio for GO, APTES/GO, fresh
Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, and recovered Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst
is found to be 0.89, 0.98, 0.97, and 0.98, respectively. Increment
in the ID/IG ratio from GO to APTES/GO indicates increase in the sp3 character of the graphitic carbon, whereas no significant changes
observed for the ID/IG ratio for Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO. This suggest that further
modifications of the catalyst have been observed at APTES not at graphitic
carbon of GO. Moreover, XRD and Raman characterization suggest that
the nanocatalyst shows no significant structural change after catalytic
activity.

the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs
of GO and Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO for detailed analysis of the nanocatalyst
surface. Figure 2a,
shows the wrinkled sheet-like characteristic morphology of GO, while Figure 2b–d shows
the morphology of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst under different
magnifications. Irregular-shaped NPs of CuO attached to the surface
of APTES modified GO has been viewed in these micrographs.

The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO is
shown in Figure S1 that confirmed the presence
of Cu and Si in the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst. Figure 3f shows the elemental percentage
of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO which was obtained from the EDX pattern. The
copper content in Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO was detected to be 13.5 at.
% by EDX, a far better loading amount than already known in literature50−56 which is responsible for acting as an efficient catalyst for xanthene
synthesis.

2.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy
GO, fresh Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, and recovered Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
were subjected to high resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) and are illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the overlapped sheet-like morphology of GO. Figure 4b,c represent the uniform distribution
of CuO NPs in the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst, under different
magnifications. Furthermore, the HRTEM image of the recovered Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
nanocatalyst is depicted in Figure 4d, showing no significant change from Figure 4c. These results confirmed
that there is no agglomeration of small size CuO NPs in the nanocatalyst
after catalysis.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Figure 5 shows the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
catalyst and peaks at B.E. 283.40 and 286.56 eV can be assigned to
C–O–C/C–OH and C=C, respectively, while
a band at 101.11 eV attributed to Si–O emerged in the Si 2p
spectrum, indicating silylation of the reaction surface. The O 1s
peak with B.E. 529.83 eV represents bonding between O2– ions and Cu. The N 1s XPS spectrum reveals that a significant amount
of N–H was transformed into N=C (398.35 eV) and the
N–H band at 400.24 eV. The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
shows two bands at 952.44 and 932.52 eV which corresponds to the bonding
energy of Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2. Meanwhile,
a Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 satellite peaks were
observed at 942.10 and 960.96 eV, respectively.

2.5 Catalytic
Activity Test
The catalytic
ability of the newly synthesized Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst
was investigated by the synthesis of substituted xanthenes. Moreover,
to achieve best reaction conditions for the xanthene synthesis, the
effect of different significant constraints such as the catalyst amount,
reaction time, optimal temperature, and ideal solvent is thoroughly
investigated. A model reaction between 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione
and benzaldehyde is monitored for optimization of these parameters.
For comparison purpose, Cu (II)-APTES/GO has shown lesser activity
(67% yield for model reaction) as compared to Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
because of lesser loading of CuO NPs as observed from the EDX data, Table S3.

2.5.1 Effect of Catalyst Amount,
Temperature,
Time, and Solvent System
To optimize reaction conditions
such as catalytic amount, temperature, and time required for the synthesis
of xanthenes, Table 1 demonstrates the varying amounts of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO, temperature
range and the time required for the completion of the reaction. First,
the effect of the amount of the nanocatalyst, that is, Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
is tested with model reaction.

a Reaction conditions: benzaldehyde

b Isolated yields.

By intensifying the amount of the
catalyst up to 20 mg exhibits
a noteworthy alteration in the percentage yield. Though, an additional
increment in the catalyst amount up to 30 mg, resulted in no change
in the conversion percentage. This may be because of the exhaustion
of the catalytic site or attainment of the maximum conversion efficiency
of the nanocatalyst. Congruently, temperature and time also play an
important role in affecting reaction kinetics to large extents. Henceforth,
with the intention of studying the effect of these two constraints,
a varied range of temperature (25–70 °C) is used to carry
out model reaction for different time periods (30–120 min)
and by using 20 mg of the nanocatalyst at 50 °C for a reaction
time of 30 min the percentage yield (95%) which was found as maximum.
It has been observed that no significant change has been observed
after prolonged reaction time and increased temperature.

Similarly,
even solvents may disturb the reaction environment by
changing solubility, stability of catalyst and reactants, and rate
of reaction. Therefore, an appropriate choice of solvent can eliminate
such disturbances. With the purpose of obtaining an excellent catalytic
conversion rate for synthesis of xanthenes, different solvents and
solvent mixtures were tested. Figure 6a and Table S1, summarizes
the result of variety of solvent systems on the percentage yield of
xanthenes under different temperature conditions for various time
periods. After careful examination of all results water/ethanol mixture
in the 1:1 ratio is preferred over other solvents. The ethanol/water
(1:1) mixture gave best results. As in case of water, low solubility
of aromatic aldehydes and lesser dispersion of the catalyst were prime
reasons for lesser activity. Because both water and ethanol are considered
as green solvents, so generation of waste from the reaction is minimized
and essence of green chemistry is maintained. Thereafter, this particular
solvent mixture is used as reaction solvent for all further reactions.

2.5.2 Syntheses
of Substituted Xanthene Derivatives
Using The Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO Nanocatalyst
Using the optimized
reaction conditions, we further inspected the opportunity using 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione
or 1,3-cyclohexanedione (2 mmol), and various benzaldehydes (1 mmol).
A wide range of xanthenes are synthesized in good to excellent yield
by screening an array of benzaldehydes having electron withdrawing
as well as electron donating groups displays Table 2. In case of 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde, longer
reaction time would take to complete the reaction which may be because
of hydrogen bonding between −OH of aldehyde with the water–ethanol
solvent system.

2.6 Plausible Mechanism of the Reaction
Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO catalyze synthesis of xanthene derivatives by
activating the carbonyl group of aldehydes making it more susceptible
to nucleophilic attack by 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione to form
intermediate (I), followed by Michael addition of another molecule
of 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione to form the intermediate (II).
Intramolecular cyclization occurs after successive elimination of
H2O which results in the desired product and regenerates
Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO in the reaction mixture(Figure 7).

2.7 Comparison
of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO with Reported
Catalysts for the Synthesis of Xanthenes
A comparison of
catalytic efficiency of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst with
other catalysts, already described in literature, for the preparation
of xanthene derivatives, revealed advantages of Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO
in terms of better yield with shorter reaction time (Table 3, entry 11). In the backdrop
of these findings, Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO is found to be a very efficient
catalyst for efficient synthesis of xanthene and its derivatives (Table 3).

2.8 Recyclability of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO Nanocatalyst
A highly preferred way to greener and economic synthesis is recovery
and recyclability of a catalyst. After endowing the activity and versatility
of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO catalyst for different types of reactions,
the recyclability of the catalyst was examined using benzaldehyde
and dimedone as model reaction under optimized conditions. The nanocatalyst
was separated from the reaction mixture using centrifugation followed
by washing with ethyl acetate and ethanol, and finally dried at 80
°C under vacuum for the next cycle of reaction. Recyclability
results of the Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO nanocatalyst are shown in Figure 6b and tabulated in Table S2. The XRD pattern, Raman spectra and
HRTEM images also indicate that the catalyst stability has been maintained
up to 5 cycles (Figures 2di,ii and 5d). Hence, it is proving proficiency
for various industrial applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel, efficient, recyclable, and economic heterogeneous
nanocatalyst Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO was developed. This nanocatalyst
was found as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of different
industry important xanthene and its derivatives under greener solvent
conditions with excellent yields. High Cu loading of 13.5 at. % over
functionalized GO which is far superior than already known metal-based
heterogeneous catalysts which helps in attaining this excellent catalytic
performance. Moreover, the recyclability test demonstrated that it
can be reused for five consecutive runs without appreciable loss in
catalytic efficiency. The additional advantages of the present catalyst
include simplicity, reaction time, yield, cost, and selectivity as
compared to other catalysts available in literature for the same organic
transformation. Furthermore, green solvent condition, ambient reaction
conditions, faster synthesis, inexpensive reactants, easy catalyst
recovery, and recyclability make this methodology a potential candidate
for sustainable synthesis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of GO
GO was synthesized
by following the improved synthesis method67 with some modifications. Briefly, in a round bottom flask, a mixture
(9:1) of concd H2SO4 and H3PO4 was taken, in which 1.5 g of graphite powder was added. After
that 9.0 g of KMnO4 was added gradually. The mixture was
stirred at 50–55 °C for 12 h. The brown paste so formed
was poured into a beaker having ice and subsequently, H2O2 (30%, 3 mL) was added to stop the oxidation process
which results in the solution turning yellow. Above dispersion was
centrifuged and the solid was washed twice with deionized water, followed
by washing twice with 30% HCl solution for the removal of undesired
metal ions. Then washing with ethanol was carried out repeatedly until
a clear brown solid (GO) was obtained.

4.2 Synthesis
of Functionalized GO (APTES/GO and
Fur-APTES/GO)
GO functionalization has been carried out with
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APTES). 3-APTES (1.0 mL, 4.28 mmol)
was added to 250.0 mL ethanolic solution of well-dispersed GO (250
mg) under vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 20 h at 60
°C under N2 atmosphere. As the obtained black solid
was separated by centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and
dried at 80 °C under vacuum. The isolated black solid was redispersed
in ethanol and Fur was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at
60 °C for 24 h. The product was separated using centrifugation,
washed with ethanol to remove excess Fur and dried at 80 °C under
vacuum. FT-IR approving the formation of imine-functionalized GO is
shown in Figure S1.

4.3 Synthesis
of GO-Based Copper Nanocatalyst
[Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO]
To the well-dispersed ethanolic solution
of Fur-APTES/GO, copper(II) acetate (2.0 mmol, 0.363 mg) was added
and stirred for 24 h at 60 °C. The catalyst was purified by centrifugation,
followed by repeated washing with ethanol and drying under vacuum
at 80 °C.

4.4 Catalytic Activity
A mixture of aromatic
aldehyde (1.0 mmol), 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione or 1,3-cyclohexanedione
(2.0 mmol), Cu(II)-Fur-APTES/GO catalyst (20 mg) in 1:1 aqueous ethanol
(5.0 mL) was stirred at 50 °C for suitable time as indicated
by thin-layer chromatography. After reaction completion, the reaction
mixture was diluted using hot ethanol (10.0 mL) and filtered for catalyst
separation. The crude product was obtained by solvent evaporation
under reduced pressure and recrystallized from ethanol. The recovered
catalyst was washed initially with ethyl acetate, afterward with ethanol
and dried overnight for further reuse. Recrystallized xanthene derivatives
were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
