Nanoparticle (NP)-stabilized
foam technology has found potential
applications in CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and greenhouse
gas geological storage practices and accordingly attracts lots of
research interest. To screen the optimal formula for the satisfactory
foam performance, orthogonal experimental design (OED) is used in
this paper for the complex multifactor multilevel system consisting
of five influential factors of NP size, surfactant concentration,
NP concentration, temperature, and salinity at four different levels
in the range of 7–40 nm, 0–0.15 wt %, 0–0.2 wt
%, 25–55 °C, and 0–3 wt %, respectively. Based
on the orthogonal principle, only 16 experiments were performed to
analyze the effect of various factors on the foam height and foam
half-life properties. In addition to showing that the influence of
the single factor on foam static properties, OED results reveal that
the surfactant concentration and temperature are dominating factors
on foamability and stability of the NP-stabilized CO2 foam,
respectively. Finally, NP-stabilized CO2 foam with satisfactory
static characteristics is obtained with the OED recommended composition
of a 0.15 wt % surfactant concentration, 0.1 wt % NP concentration,
and NP size of 7 nm in 1 wt % saline solution at temperatures of 30
and 50 °C, validating that the OED method could substantially
facilitate the laboratory screening and optimization process for a
successful NP-stabilized CO2 foam application.

1 Introduction
The enhancement technology
for oil recovery has become increasingly
important with the continued exploration of underground oil reserves.
The CO2 flooding process can not only significantly enhance
oil production but also, in the meantime, economically and efficiently
store large-scale greenhouse gas in the tight underground formations.
Therefore, it has attracted lots of interest from researchers in recent
years.1−4

Due to the low viscosity and density, the injected CO2 is highly prone to gas channeling and gravity segregation
in underground
formations, which results in low sweep efficiency of the reservoir.5,6 A popular way of CO2 mobility control is to generate
foam in situ with surfactant solutions, which can significantly improve
the sweep efficiency and accelerate the rate of CO2 dissolution
in the oil phase by increasing the contact area between the oil and
CO2.7−11 There are obvious disadvantages, however, for the surfactant-based
CO2 foam, such as it can be easily defoamed after being
exposed to crude oil under reservoir conditions and easily decomposed
under high temperature and high salinity conditions.12 Therefore, it is of great practical significance to improve
the stability of the CO2 foam system for its potential
field applications.

It has been demonstrated in the past decade
that solid particles
can effectively improve the foam stability;13−15 and with the
development of nanotechnology, nanoparticles (NPs) have been identified
as effective foam stabilizers in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications
with high stability and persistence.16−18 Since NPs have certain
solid particle characteristics compared to the surfactant, the film
formed by the adsorption of NPs at the gas–liquid interface
has higher mechanical strength and thus enhances the stability of
the foam. The NPs adsorbed at the gas–liquid interface can
form a spatial network structure to reduce the direct contact between
the fluids, thereby acting as a barrier to the liquid discharge and
gas diffusion to prevent membrane cracking and bubble coarsening.19−22

To evaluate foam generation and stability properties of the
NP-stabilized
foam system, however, comprehensive laboratory tests have to be performed
considering quite a few influential factors, such as NP surface wettability,
NP concentration, NP sizes, NP types, presence of oil, temperature,
pressure, salinity, gas type, and so on.23 The accommodation of so many influential factors in one set of laboratory
tests, therefore, becomes a challenging task. Up to now, most researchers
employed the separate control variable method in their studies, that
is, varying one parameter of study while keeping other parameters
unchanged. Although the separate control variable method could give
clear and accurate vision on each variable studied through comparing
with the solid benchmark case, this method is quite time consuming
when involving a large number of influential factors and, therefore,
was mostly employed to focus on specific one- or two-variable effects.
For example, Attarhamed et al.24 studied
the effects of alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) and SiO2 NPs
on foam stability and found that 15 nm NPs could control foam stability
at higher NP concentrations, while 250 nm is more suitable to generate
stable foam at lower concentrations. Worthen et al.25 studied the foam generation properties with either poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG)-coated silica or methylsilyl-modified silica NPs. Babamahmoudi
et al.26 investigated the effect of the
presence of crude oil on the static characteristics of foamability
and foam stability of the NP foam. They reported that the presence
of crude oil could obviously reduce foam stability. Yekeen et al.27 studied the influence of silicon oxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) NPs on
the stability of NPs and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixed solution
foams. They reported increased foam stability but decreased foamability
at higher NP concentrations. Singh et al.28 studied two types of silica NPs and observed that the grafting of
low-molecular-weight polymers/ligands on silica NP surfaces resulted
in steric stabilization under high-temperature (80 °C) and high-salinity
(8 wt % NaCl and 2 wt % CaCl2) conditions.

For laboratory
screening and optimization studies on such a sophisticated
system as NP-stabilized surfactant CO2 foam, multifactor
multilevel studies should be carried out to obtain the foam with satisfactory
static properties. The separate control variable experimental method
becomes somewhat impractical. The number of trials will increase dramatically
with the increasing number of parameters studied and variable levels,
which will not only bring a lot of research work but also imply a
lot of raw materials and time. To tackle this problem, an orthogonal
experimental design (OED) is introduced in this paper. As one of the
important statistical methods employing the Taguchi parameter design
methodology, the OED allows the effects of many factors with a couple
of levels to be studied in a relatively small number of runs and provides
a powerful and efficient method to find an optimal combination of
factor levels that may achieve optimum.29 The OED method has been successfully applied in many other industrial
fields on acquiring the optimum level group.30−35

The OED method is employed in this paper, therefore, to study
the
synthetic effect of multifactors on foam static properties. Five critical
parameters, including NP size, surfactant concentration, NP concentration,
temperature, and salinity, are investigated at four different levels
based on OED. Although each of the five factors has been well investigated
as separate variables, the effort in obtaining optimal parameter combination
under multifactor conditions has been scarcely reported. With limited
numbers of 16 orthogonally arranged tests for the five-factor four-level
case, we distinguish in this paper the effect of each factor on the
foam static properties and validate our research work by proposing
an optimal parameter combination to produce the NP-stabilized CO2 foam with satisfactory foam height and foam half-life results.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
In the
experiments, CO2 with a purity of 99% is employed as the
gas phase. Normal
dodecane (n-C12H26, with a
molecular weight of 170.34, provided by Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical
Research Institute) is used throughout the experiments to simulate
the presence of oil in the environment. α-Olefin sulfonate (AOS,
purity greater than 99.9%, provided by the Sinolight Chemical Industry
Group) is employed as a surfactant due to its wide application in
foam displacing oil processes.36,37 Analytically pure NaCl
(Tianjin Bodi Chemicals) is dissolved in deionized water to simulate
the solution salinity. Silica NPs (model NPOX50, NP150, NP200, and
NP300, supplied in powder form by Evonik, Germany) are employed as
additive foam stabilizers. Table 1 lists the average primary size together with the specific
surface area for the employed NPs, showing the average size and specific
surface area range of 7–40 nm and 300–50 m2/g, respectively.

Table 1 Particle Size, Specific Surface Area,
and Contact Angle for Different NPs

NP	average primary

NP200	12	200 ± 25	38.2	
NP300	7	300 ± 30	39.5	
The hydrophilicity
of silicon NP was determined through the solid
drop method, with which the contact angle between water and the compressed
silica NP tablet was measured using an Interfacial Shear Rheometer.
As listed in Table 1, all of the contact angles for the silica NPs are less than 90°,
showing the hydrophilicity of NPs. The well-distributed NPs in the
solution were validated through the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) test as well.38

2.2 Preparation of NP–Surfactant Aqueous
Dispersion in the Presence of Oil
To disperse the NPs effectively
and sufficiently together with the surfactant in the aqueous solution,
a certain mass of NPs and powder surfactant was mixed in 100 mL solution,
consisting of 90 wt % deionized water and 10 wt % n-C12H26 in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then, the NP–surfactant
solution was stirred at high speed (1200 rpm) for 2 h with a magnetic
stirrer and was dispersed for another 2 h in an ultrasonic disperser
under a frequency of 40 kHz.

The sedimentation test is essential
for evaluating whether or not there is aggregation in the prepared
solution.39 With this preparation procedure,
the NP–surfactant solution could remain stable for 24 h without
exhibiting any sedimentation in the flask, validating the good preparation
of the aqueous dispersion.

2.3 Generation of NP–Surfactant-Aided
CO2 Foam
The NP–surfactant-aided CO2 foam generation system, as shown in Figure 1, mainly consists of a CO2 gas
cylinder, gas mass flow controller, glass beaker, electrical agitator,
water bath, and vacuum pump. At first, the well-dispersed NP–surfactant
solution was poured into a 1000 mL beaker (108.2 mm in diameter and
113.4 mm in height), which is placed in a water bath to maintain the
NP–surfactant solution at the desired temperature. Then, the
tightly covered beaker was vacuumed for 5 min to reach a vacuum degree
of 0.08 MPa. After this, CO2 gas was continuously introduced
into the beaker at 50 mL/min for 20 min with the tube exit just located
above the surface of the aqueous solution to achieve the satisfactory
CO2 environment in the following foam generation process.
Rich foam was then generated with the electric agitator by maintaining
the blade rotation speed of 1500 rpm for 5 min and a CO2 injection rate of 40 mL/min.

Figure 1 NP-stabilized CO2 foam generation
system.

2.4 Measurement
of Bulk Foam Static Properties
and Error Analysis
Bulk foam static properties mainly consist
of foam generation capacity and foam stability, which could be characterized
through the foam height and foam decay half-life results, respectively.

2.4.1 Foam Height
When the rich and stable
bulk foam was obtained, the maximum height of the generated foam was
visually measured in the 1000 mL glass beaker as the column height
between the top bubble surface and the liquid interface after pulling
up the electric agitator from the NP–surfactant solution. For
instance, the generated NP-stabilized foam in the glass beaker in
Test No. 3, as listed in Table 2, is depicted in Figure 2, from which it is observed that the foam has been
well generated and the foam height is measured to be 72 mm.

foam with the foam height measurement result for
Test No. 3.

2.4.2 Foam Decay Half-Life
The foam half-life,
the time taken to reach half of the foams’ original height,
has been widely employed to characterize the foam stability with a
larger value, indicating a more stable foam. After completing the
measurement of the foam height in the beaker, the foam half-life is
measured in a 250 mL graduated cylinder (37.7 mm in diameter and 213
mm in height). The generated foam together with the aqueous solution
was poured into the cylinder from the glass beaker with a uniform
speed until the bubble top surface reaches the largest scale of the
glass container. The transfer of the generated foam to a much smaller
but taller container could produce a much larger foam column reading
data, which significantly reduces the measurement error of the foam
volume variation with time. The foam half-time was measured as the
time when the foam volume reduces to half of the initial volume value
in the graduated cylinder. Figure 3 displays the measurement process of the foam half-life
in Test No. 3. It could be clearly observed that the initial foam
volume is 160 mL and, after 40 min, the volume decreases to 80 mL,
which determines the foam half-life to be 40 min.

Figure 3 Foam half-life measurement
process and result for Test No. 3.

The measurement error could be analyzed based on the following
characteristic values in the tests. As to the foam height, the visual
measurement error is 2.0 mm, indicating a relative error of 10% based
on the minimum value of 20 mm in all rounds of measurements. In a
similar way, the foam half-life measurement error is estimated to
be 7.5%, which consists of the volume measurement error of 6.7% (10
mL in 150 mL) plus 0.8% error on the time measurement (5 s in 10 min).

2.5 Experimental Parameter Arrangement Based on
the OED
The static properties of NP-stabilized CO2 foam were investigated based on the orthogonal arrangement of the
five influential factors, including NP size, surfactant concentration,
NP concentration, temperature, and salinity. When each of the five
parameters was studied at four levels, the number of experiments required
for one-factor-at-a-time design could reach 1024 (=45),
which is too large to be fulfilled in a limited time and at acceptable
test expenses. In the orthogonal test design, however, the number
for the five-factor four-level case could be significantly reduced
to 16 according to an L16(45) orthogonal table,
which obviously alleviates the workload compared to 1024 in the separate
variable test scheme.

Among the five influential factors, the
NP size is the first factor and is studied at four various diameter
levels, 7, 12, 14, and 40 nm, based on the reported range of 12–36
nm.28,40,41 The surfactant
concentration is the second influential factor and varies at four
levels, 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 wt %, respectively, with reference
to the reported research studies.28,40 As the NP
concentration of 0.05–0.15 wt %40,42−45 has shown good performance in core flooding and foam static behaviors,
the variation of the NP concentration as the third factor starts from
0 to 0.2 wt % at four levels, 0, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 wt %. The fourth
influential factor is the system temperature and is studied at four
levels, 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C, which covers most temperature
ranges in reported research studies.28,43−47 Solution salinity is the fifth parameter and is investigated based
on four different NaCl concentrations, 0, 1, 2, and 3 wt %, in the
aqueous mixture in compliance with the reported range 0–3 wt
%.43−47

Table 2 lists
the
16 experimental parameter combinations based on the orthogonal arrangement
principle with the help of the software “Orthogonality Experimental
Assistant” (Sharetop Software Studio).

It is noted that
the parameter of pressure, which could influence
CO2 solubility and miscibility, is not included in the
studying variable list. Actually, the pressure effect on the static
properties of NP-stabilized CO2 foam was scarcely reported
in the previous literature. Emrani et al.48 found a decrease in the half-life of nanosilica-stabilized CO2 foam as pressure increased from 300 to 800 psi, while they
tested the foam generation capability with shake tests under ambient
conditions. Both Xiao et al.49 and Kumar
et al.50 carried out the static property
studies on NP-stabilized CO2 foam under atmospheric conditions
to help in understanding the supercritical CO2 foam displacement
behaviors in harsh reservoir conditions. It is deduced that the difficulties
in evaluating both the static properties of foam height and foam half-life
in pressurized containers result in insufficient studies on the effect
of pressure on NP-stabilized CO2 foam.23 In addition, the aim of our work is to demonstrate the
feasibility of OED on optimal parameter screening instead of focusing
on single-parameter investigations; therefore, we did not involve
the parameter of pressure as one of the screening factors in this
paper.

2.6 Evaluation of the Impact of Various Factors
on Bulk Foam Static Properties
The impact of each factor
on bulk foam static properties was evaluated based on the mean and
range analysis through K and B values,
which are the reference standard of the orthogonal test and are described
as follows 1   2  where Si indicates the sum of the
test results corresponding to the ith level number
(i = 1, 4 in the five-factor
four-level case) and s is the number of occurrences
of each level in the factor column in the orthogonal table (s = 4 according to Table 2); therefore, Ki refers to the average results of the ith
level in one specific factor, whereas the B value
represents the difference between the maximum K value
and the minimum K value of the specific factor, reflecting
the significance of the studied factor on the foam static characteristics.
Based on the K and B values, the
effect and significance of each influential factor on the foam static
behavior could be obtained, and thereby the reasonable parameter combinations
could be proposed to achieve NP-stabilized foam with satisfactory
foamability and stability properties.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Single Parameter
on Foam Static
Properties
3.1.1 Overview of the Foam Height and Foam Half-Life
Results from the 16 Tests
In correspondence to Table 2, Figures 4 and 5 display the
foam height and foam half-life results under the 16 orthogonally distributed
parameter conditions. As seen from Figure 4, a remarkable difference could be observed
among various conditions, with foam height varying from 0 mm (the
case of Nos. 1, 5, 9, and 13 in which there is no surfactant present)
to 79 mm in case No. 15 under the parameters of Csurf = 0.1 wt %, CNP = 0.1
wt %, t = 55 °C, and Csalt = 0. Similarly, Figure 5 shows obvious scattering on foam half-time results
ranging from 0 min (case of Nos. 1, 5, 9, and 13) to 130 min in the
case of No. 12.

Figure 4 Foam height results under the 16 orthogonally distributed
parameter
conditions.

Figure 5 Foam half-life results under the 16 orthogonally
distributed parameter
conditions.

To gain insight into each factor’s
effect and thereby to
propose an optimal parameter combination, more detailed analysis has
been carried out in the following subsections.

3.1.2 Effect of NP Size
As shown in Table 1, four models of SiO2 NPs with
different sizes of 40, 14, 12, and 7 nm were employed
in the study. Figure 6 displays the K values of the foam half-life and
foam height on the left and right sidebar, respectively, corresponding
to the four different levels of NP sizes. As can be clearly seen from
the figure, the NP with the smallest diameter of 7 nm and the highest
specific area of 300 m2/g produces the longest foam half-life
results, showing the best foam stability. The foam stability of the
NP–surfactant solution decreases with increasing NP sizes,
indicating that smaller NPs are more advantageous for generating CO2 foam with satisfactory static characteristics. It is also
observed from the figure that when the particle size increases from
12 to 14 nm, the foam half-life value decreases obviously from 53
to 38 min. On the other hand, the size impact on the foam height result
is not significant in the studied NP size range 7–40 nm.

Figure 6 Effect of NP
size on the foam half-life and foam height results.

The increasing foam stability with decreasing NP sizes could
attribute
to the easy movement of the smaller NPs to the gas–liquid interface
of the foam.51,52 Higher energy barrier between
the particles and the interface is seen for NPs with larger diameters.
Hence, smaller NPs migrate faster into the interface and better improved
foam stability is observed than in the larger-sized NPs.53 The experimental results on the foam height
are to some extent consistent with Xiao et al.,49 who found that the foamability could be promoted by either
smaller or larger size NPs at different foam qualities.

3.1.3 Effect of Surfactant Concentration
Four levels of surfactant
concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15
wt % have been employed in the tests, and their average effects on
foam static behavior are plotted in Figure 7 in terms of the foam half-life and foam
height results. A remarkable effect of surfactant concentration, especially
in the region of 0–0.05 wt %, could be observed in this figure,
indicating that the presence of the surfactant is essential for the
NP-stabilized CO2 foam capacity and stability. Although
further increased surfactant concentration could result in better
static characteristics; for instance, the CO2 foam at the
highest Csurf of 0.15 wt % shows the longest
half-life of 65 min and the Csurf of 0.1
wt % shows the highest foam height of 74 mm, its effects become insignificant
in the Csurf region of 0.05–0.15
wt % compared to the impact in the region of 0–0.05 wt %. According
to Emrani et al.,54 the critical micelle
concentration (CMC) of AOS in CO2 foam is around 0.1 wt
%, and the presence of NP does not show obvious influence on the CMC
of the surfactant. Our results show that even 0.05 wt % AOS could
generate satisfactory CO2 foam in the presence of NP, while
0.15 wt % AOS could achieve the best static behavior NP foams, indicating
that the AOS concentration just above CMC could generate satisfactory
foams even at high salinity and in the presence of oil in the environment,
validating again the positive function of NP on CO2 foam
generation and stability.

Figure 7 Effect of surfactant concentration on the foam
half-life and foam
height results.

The reason for the presence of
the surfactant on significantly
enhancing the foam generation and stability could be attributed to
the increased hydrophobicity by the surfactant adsorption at the particle–water
interface due to the electrostatic interaction between the surface
of the nanoparticles and the oppositely charged surfactant head groups.
In addition, the available surface free energy for the attachment
of NPs to the interface of the foam can be regulated by changing the
surfactant concentration.23 Actually, mixing
of the surfactant and hydrophilic NPs is less technical and cheaper
than surface modification of NPs through chemical treatment since
hydrophilic NPs are less expensive and readily disperse in water.55

3.1.4 Effect of NP Concentration
The
effects of NP concentration on the foam half-life and foam height
values are displayed in Figure 8 through averaging the results obtained at four different
levels of 0, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 wt %, respectively. Based on the foam
half-life results with reference to the left sidebar, it is observed
that an intermediate concentration of 0.1 wt % NPs produces the most
stable foam with the longest half-time of 58.8 min in contrast with
20, 47.5, and 50 min at 0, 0.15, and 0.2 wt %, respectively. According
to the K value on the right side of the diagram,
the foam height is between 50 and 55 mm in all of the studied NP concentration
range, indicating that the NP concentration has little effect on CO2 foam generation capacity.

Figure 8 Effect of NP concentration on the foam
half-life and foam height
results.

Although the presence of NPs slows
down liquid drainage and film
thinning, the accumulation of NPs at the air–water interface
of the foam has to exceed a certain threshold concentration to enhance
foam stability. At a low concentration of NPs, the adsorbed nanoparticles
at the gas–liquid interface are not sufficient to improve the
foam stability, thereby a certain NP concentration is needed to generate
stable foam.23 Our experimental observations
are consistent with Yekeen et al.,27 who
reported an optimal NP concentration for CO2 foam half-life
results and a negligible effect of NP concentration on foam height
properties.

3.1.5 Effect of Temperature
The significant
impact of temperature on foam stability behavior is observed from Figure 9, in which the K values of the foam half-life and foam height results are
depicted under various temperatures. The foam half-life results, as
plotted in squares with reference to the left sidebar scales, decrease
unanimously from 83.75 min at 25 °C to 12.5 min at 55 °C,
indicating that an elevated system temperature is unfavorable to the
NP-stabilized foam stability. The temperature effect on foam generation
capacity, however, is not as significant as that on foam stability,
with foam height values varying between 51 and 54.75 mm in the studied
temperature range of 25–55 °C.

Figure 9 Effect of temperature
on the foam half-life and foam height results.

This accelerated foam rupture process under increased temperature
conditions could contribute to the insufficient adsorption of NPs
on the foam lamellae due to the more intense thermal agitation of
NPs at higher temperatures, which leads to a reduction in the foaming
solution viscosity and the increasing rate of gas diffusion and liquid
drainage from the foam films.23

3.1.6 Effect of Solution Salinity
Electrolyte
concentration is a major concern for the generation and stability
of NP foams. Therefore, in this section, the relationship between
the NP-stabilized foam half-life and height and the NaCl concentration
in the aqueous solution is investigated.

As shown in Figure 10, the foam height
is stable between 50 and 54.3 mm in the solution salinity range of
0–3.0 wt %. The experimental observation is consistent with
Yu et al.,56 who reported that there was
no significant influence of salinity on CO2 foam generation.
However, the foam demonstrates the highest stability with a half-life
of 63.8 min at a salinity of 1 wt %, clearly in contrast with 35,
46.3, and 33.8 min at a salinity of 0, 2.0, and 3.0 wt %, respectively.
The observation of optimal, or critical, salt concentration on foam
stability has also been reported in previous studies,57,58 and the mechanism behind this phenomena has been attributed to the
competitive action between the repulsive electrostatic forces and
the van der Waals forces according to Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) theory.52

Figure 10 Effect of salinity on
the foam half-life and foam height results.

3.2 Range Analysis of the Five Influencing Factors
The affecting ranges for each studied factors on the foam half-life
and foam height properties are investigated through the B parameter
as described in eq 2 and
are block mapped in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. With influential
factor No. 1–5 corresponding to NP size, surfactant concentration,
NP concentration, temperature, and salinity, the importance of each
factor on foam static characteristics could be clearly observed.

Figure 11 B values of various influential factors on the
foam half-life result (factor Nos. 1–5 represent NP size, surfactant
concentration, NP concentration, temperature, and salinity).

Figure 12 B values of various influential factors
on the
foam height result (factor Nos. 1–5 represent NP size, surfactant
concentration, NP concentration, temperature, and salinity).

As shown in Figure 11, the most determinative factor for a longer
foam half-time is factor
No. 4 of temperature, followed by the surfactant concentration, NP
concentration, NP size, and salinity, whereas Figure 12 shows that the most significant influential
factor for foam height is the surfactant concentration, which shows
obvious dominance on foam generation capacity compared to other four
factors of salinity, temperature, NP size, and NP concentration.

3.3 Optimal Parameters Based on the Results of
Orthogonally Designed Experiments
Based on the above analysis
of each factor’s influence on foam static characteristics,
we could propose the optimal combination of parameters to generate
NP-stabilized CO2 foam with the most favorable properties
in the test range. In practical conditions where the reservoir fluid
salinity and temperature are usually fixed, the optimal parameter
combination of surfactant concentration, NP concentration, and NP
size is the main concern of engineers. Based on the results obtained
from Figures 6–8, a combinative parameter of 0.15 wt % AOS + 0.1
wt % NP300 (7 nm in primary size) was employed with an aim to generate
NP-stabilized CO2 foam with satisfactory static properties
under a given salinity of 1 wt % and temperatures of 30 and 50 °C
in the presence of oil.

Figure 13 shows the foam half-life and foam height results of
the NP-stabilized CO2 foam under the proposed parameters.
It is clearly observed that the foam could remain stable at the half
decay times of 30 and 96 min and the generated foam height could reach
73 and 75 mm, respectively, at 30 and 50 °C, which are among
the best behaviors in the test ranges. It is concluded, therefore,
that the OED method could be properly employed in multifactor multilevel
investigations on foam static properties, which could further help
essentially in the screening process of the NP-stabilized CO2 foam for its successful field applications.

height results under optimal parameter
combination (0.15 wt % AOS + 0.1 wt % NP300) supplied from OED tests.

4 Conclusions
In this
paper, parameter screening studies have been carried out
to achieve satisfactory static behavior of NP-stabilized CO2 foam in the presence of oil. The effects of five key factors, including
NP size, surfactant concentration, NP concentration, temperature,
and salinity, have been investigated at four different levels based
on the OED method. With orthogonally arranged parameters, 16 tests
were performed to analyze the effect of various factors on foam static
characteristics of the foam height and foam half-life. The following
concluding remarks have been obtained:(1) In the test ranges of NP size of 7–40
nm and surfactant concentration of 0–0.15 wt %, smaller NP
size and higher surfactant concentration lead to better foam stability.

(2) In the test NP concentration
range
of 0–0.2 wt %, an intermediate value of 0.1 wt % could stabilize
the CO2 foam with the longest period of time.

(3) In the test ranges of temperature
between 25 and 55 °C and NaCl concentration between 0 and 3 wt
%, a critical salinity of 1 wt % was observed for better foam stability.

(4) Compared to the other
four factors,
range analysis indicates that temperature is the most dominating factor
on the NP-stabilized CO2 foam half-life, while the surfactant
concentration is the dominating factor influencing the foam generation
capacity.

(5) Satisfactory
foam static characteristics
were obtained based on the OED-recommended parameter combination of
0.15 wt % AOS, 0.1 wt % NP, and NP300 (7 nm) under two system temperatures
of 30 and 50 °C, validating the robustness of the OED method
on parameter screening for optimizing the static properties of NP-stabilized
CO2 foam.
