1 Introduction
Heterocyclic
compounds bearing quinoline (benzo[b]pyridine) core
are time honored roomy class of organic structures
which represent a variety of pharmacological potentialities. Quinoline
is an influential pharmacophore in the medicinal chemistry and embraces
diverse activities such as antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal,
antitubercular, antitumor, anticancer, anti-HIV, antiprotozoal, anti-inflammatory,
antiproliferative, antioxidant, DNA binding, and antihypertensive.
Also, these structures are found to be active in agrochemical chemistry,
dye molecules, and coordination chemistry.1−7Scheme 1, portrayed
some natural products and synthetic drugs with a quinoline core.

Scheme 1 Some Natural Products and Synthetic Drug-Bearing Quinoline Core
Among quinoline structural kernel, 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
has a quite elegant position. They have been applied as immunosuppressive
agents, neurokinin receptor antagonists, mosquito repellant, antiviral,
antimicrobial agents, and industrial antioxidants.8,9 Also,
these versatile molecules, applied as key precursors for the construction
of other quinolone-based biological active structures.10 Because of these versatilities, some protocols
reported for the synthesis of 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic acids.10−19 For example, the Doebner synthesis of quinoline-4-carboxylic derivatives
had been adapted to the solid phase.11b Although, these methods resolved some issues in the way of 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
acids, but they connected with some difficulties including long reaction
times, using unsafe organic solvents, low yields, and rough reaction
conditions. Therefore, presenting new, mild, and convenient synthetic
protocols for their preparation are quite valuable.

In the green
chemistry domain, catalysis is a key element. Nowadays,
because of the environmental concerns associated with chemical synthesis,
preparation, and application of eco-friendly and compassionate catalytic
systems are the most urgent need of chemists. On the other hand, it
is clear that “catalyst activity” and “catalyst
separation” are two critical factors in the knowledge of catalysis,
and the professional chemists are seeking catalytic systems which
embrace these two factors together. Compared with traditional homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic systems, with nanocatalysis in hand, chemists
are working on approaching these factors. These semiheterogeneous
catalysts present a large surface-to-volume ratio which is a great
solution to boost catalysts activity. To overcome the difficulties
of catalysts separation, using magnetic nanoparticles is the most
reasonable solution. Therefore, with a combination of nanoscience
and catalysis, chemists can design and apply catalytic species which
inherit both “catalyst activity” and “catalyst
separation” concurrently.20−28

In order to achieve “ideal synthesis”, chemists
applied
a multicomponent reaction (MCR) strategy as a fundamental synthetic
tool. MCR behavior represents varied fascinating features which guarantee
its position in the green chemistry area. These features are including
convergent one-pot reaction processes, less aggressive reaction conditions
to the environment, quick access to a library of complex molecules
and time, atom, and step economy.29−37

Anomeric effect as an important stereoelectronic interaction
has
an influential role to justify some unusual phenomena in the chemistry
knowledge. For example, in the case of 2-fluoro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-dioxole,
dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance discloses the hidden ionicity.
In this molecule, because of the cooperative anomeric effect of two
oxygen atoms; the fluorine atom which exists at the anomeric position
quickly shifts from one face of the ring to the opposite face (Scheme 2).38

Scheme 2 Anomeric Effect Leads to Hidden Iconicity in 2-Fluoro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-dioxole
Another fascinating feature of anomeric effect
is the capability
of bond weakening.39 Also, cooperativity
of anomeric effects (double anomeric effect) can explain some intriguing
experimental observations. This case occurred when more than one donor
and an acceptor are germinal and exist in a single molecule such as
cyclic hemi-orthoesters. In this case, each conformers lead to a different
product (Scheme 3).40

Scheme 3 Cooperative Anomeric Effect in the Hydrolysis
of Cyclic Hemi-Orthoesters
One of the important subsets of the anomeric effect is the vinylogous
anomeric effect.41−48 In the vinylogous anomeric effect, donors interact with acceptors
through double bonds.40 This phenomenon
is responsible for the pseudoaxial orientation of the acyloxy group
at C-3 in a glycal.49Scheme 4, shows the structural outcome
of the cooperative vinylogous anomeric effect which leads to elongation
to an exocyclic C–N bond compared with the C–N bond
of the model molecule without the oxygen atom.50

In continuation of
our efforts to develop catalysts bearing a urea
moiety,51−54 this exploration describes the facile synthesis of 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
acid derivatives in the presence of a catalytic amount of novel Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride relying on the
expansion of our recently established concept, namely, anomeric-based
oxidation (Scheme 5 and 6).55−62

2 Result
and Discussion
Development of the knowledge of catalysts
and catalytic systems
are our major interest. For many years, the application of catalysts
had been an attractive matter for researchers all over the world.
Therefore, we decided to develop our knowledge on the design, synthesis,
and application of new catalysts for synthesis target molecules which
are proceeded via an anomeric-based oxidation mechanism.

2.1 Characterization of Novel Catalyst
First, by applying
proper techniques including Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), elemental mapping,
thermo gravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), the structure and
successful formation of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic
acid chloride were confirmed. The outcome of all applied analysis
was discussed below in detail.

In a comparative manner, FT-IR
spectra of each stage of the preparation pathway of the catalyst from
urea-based ligand (a), Fe3O4 (b), Fe3O4@SiO2 (c), Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
(d) and Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride
(e) as a target structure were investigated (Figure 1). The FT-IR spectrum of the desired catalyst
represents all predictable functional groups at their related positions.
Broad peak from about 2700–3700 cm–1 as the
fingerprint confirms the existence of acidic OH and NH functional
groups. Also, the C=O group in the urea moiety verified by
a peak at 1720 cm–1. A peak observed at 1225 cm–1 is related to S=O groups. Also, related bands
to Fe–O and Si–O functional groups appeared at around
636 and 1096 cm–1, respectively.63

Figure 1 Comparative study of FT-IR spectra of urea-based ligand (a), Fe3O4 (b), Fe3O4@SiO2 (c), Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole (d), and Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride (e).

For elemental analysis and chemical characterization of the Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride, EDX analysis
was used. The obtained data, as shown in Figure 2, approved all desired atoms, namely, iron,
oxygen, silicium, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine within the
structure of the prepared catalyst. Also, these observations are verified
by the achieved data from the elemental mapping analysis as indicated
in Figure 3. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the functionalization of the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is succeeded.

In another exploration,
surface topography of the novel prepared
nanomagnetic catalyst through scanning the surface by SEM was investigated
(Figure 4). The attained
SEM micrographs verified the spherical shape of the prepared structure
which consists of particles in the domain of the nanometer scale.
Also, the obtained images from TEM confirmed the nanosized structure
of the prepared catalyst (Figure 5).

The obtained TG and DTG
analysis curves of the prepared catalyst
were depicted in Figure 6. These curves predict high thermal stability for the presented novel-synthesized
nanomagnetic catalyst and guarantees its application at operational
elevated temperatures.

Using VSM, the magnetic
behavior of the prepared nanomagnetic catalyst
and its related intermediates including Fe3O4@SiO2 and Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole are depicted in Figure 7. These data revealed
that the insertion of each layer to the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles reduced its magnetic properties and confirmed
the successful formation of the desired catalyst.

2.2 Catalytic
Application of Novel Ionically Tagged
Magnetic Nanoparticles with a Urea Linker for the Preparation of 2-Aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
Acids
After the synthesis and identification of the novel
Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride, its catalytic
behavior was investigated in the preparation of 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
acid derivatives. To attain the optimal reaction parameters, the reaction
of 4-methyl benzaldehyde, pyruvic acid, and 1-naphthylamine was considered
as the model reaction. Upon the model reaction, the effect of reaction
temperature, catalyst loading, and solvent was checked out. On the
basis of our achieved experimental results, using 10 mg of the Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride at 80 °C
under solvent-free conditions supplied the best results. Elevating
the operational reaction temperature and increasing the amount of
the catalyst did not lead to more favorable results. All obtained
data are summarized in Table 1.

Also, we performed the model reaction
in the presence of related
intermediates of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride
at 80 °C under solvent-free conditions for 30 min. The achieved
data as inserted in Table 2 shows no satisfactory results compared with Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride.

Afterward, we focus on the generality and scope of the presented
protocol. The test was developed using different aromatic aldehydes
such as aldehydes bearing electron-releasing or withdrawing substituents
and halogens on their aromatic ring. The obtained experimental data
are included in the Table 3. All desired 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid derivatives
were furnished in short reaction times with high yields. Also, in
order to expand the generality and scope of the reaction, we tried
to use aniline instead of 1-naphthylamine to prepare the desired molecule 2a, but these conditions lead to the formation of the mixture
of products; the reaction was sluggish (Scheme 7).

a Reaction conditions:

Also, we explored the recovery and
reusability of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride in a model reaction for the synthesis of target
molecule 1b under the obtained optimized reaction parameters
for 30 min. After each individual run, hot ethanol was added to the
reaction mixture. Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride
was insoluble in the solvent, and thus it can be easily separated
from the reaction mixture by applying a simple external magnet. Then,
the recovered catalyst washed well with ethanol, dried, and preserved
for next run. Fortunately, as illustrated in Figure 8, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic
acid chloride displayed elegant recovery and reusability in model
reaction.

Figure 8 Successful reusing test of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride at the synthesis of target molecules 1b.

Also, we suggested a plausible
mechanistic pathway for the construction
of desired molecules 1a as model via an anomeric based
oxidation in the presence of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic
acid chloride (Scheme 8). Initially, naphthylamine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the
catalytic activated benzaldehyde which is converted to imine intermediate I. In the next step, enol form of pyruvic acid II, attacks the imine intermediate I which leads to the
formation of intermediate III. Then, in the presence
of the catalyst, through cyclization and dehydration processes, intermediate III is converted to the intermediate V. In the
final step of the presented mechanism, in the intermediate V, lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atom and also C–C double
bonds interact with a vacant antibonding orbital of the C–H
bond (nN → σC–H* and πC=C →
σC–H*) and weaken it, which facilitates hydride transfer. This phenomenon
leads to the aromatization of intermediate V, furnishing
of the desired molecule 1a, and recovery of the catalyst.

3 Conclusions
To sum it up, this exploration deals with the design and synthesis
of novel ionically tagged magnetic nanoparticles bearing urea linker,
namely, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride.
The mentioned catalyst was fully characterized using various techniques.
The catalytic capability of the presented catalyst on the synthesis
of 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid derivatives via anomeric based
oxidation was successfully investigated. All desired molecules were
obtained in short reaction times with high yields. The described catalyst
shows elegant recovery and reusing potential in the studied MCR.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Procedure for the
Synthesis of the
Urea-Based Ligand
At first, urea-based ligand was prepared
by the reaction of triethoxy(3-isocyanatopropyl)silane (5 mmol, 1.237
g) and 2-aminothiazole (5 mmol, 0.501 g) under solvent-free conditions
at 60 °C for 6 h. Afterward, the obtained product was washed
with a mixture of n-hexane and dichloromethane (3
× 10 mL) to afford the desired urea-based ligand (Scheme 5).

4.2 General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–Urea–Thiazole
Sulfonic Acid Chloride
Initially,
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared in a similar
manner to the previously reported procedure.64 In the next step, Fe3O4@SiO2 was
prepared through the reaction of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Afterward, the obtained Fe3O4@SiO2 (1 g) was functionalized by
the reaction with urea-based ligand (2 mmol, 0.695 g) under refluxing
toluene. In the next step, the obtained Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
was subjected to the reaction with chlorosulfuric acid (21.928 mmol,
0.233 g) in dichloromethane, as a solvent, at room temperature. In
the final step, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride
was washed thoroughly with [dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL)] and
dried (Scheme 5).

4.3 General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2-Aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
Acid Derivatives in the Presence of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–Urea–Thiazole
Sulfonic Acid Chloride
In a round-bottomed flask, a mixture
of arylaldehyde derivatives (1 mmol), pyruvic acid (1 mmol, 0.088
g), 1-naphthylamine (1 mmol, 0.143 g), and Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride (10 mg) was stirred vigorously at 80 °C
under solvent-free conditions for appropriate times (Table 2). The reaction progress and
completion were monitored by using the thin-layer chromatography technique
with n-hexane and ethyl acetate (4:6). After reaction
completion, hot ethanol was added to the mixture to dissolve the unreacted
starting materials and products. Then, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride was easily separated by using an external magnet.
Finally, recrystallization using ethanol gives desired 2-aryl-quinoline-4-carboxylic
acid derivatives in high yields.

4.4 General
Procedure for the Recycling and Reusing
Test of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–Urea–Thiazole Sulfonic Acid Chloride
for the Synthesis of Molecule 1b
In order to
explore the recovering and reusability of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride, synthesis of target molecule 1b was selected as the model reaction. The model reaction was performed
under the obtained optimized reaction parameters for 30 min. After
each individual run, hot ethanol was added to the reaction mixture.
Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole sulfonic acid chloride was insoluble
in the solvent, thus it can be easily separated from the reaction
mixture by applying a simple external magnet. Then, the recovered
catalyst was washed well with ethanol, dried, and preserved for the
next run. The obtained experimental data, as illustrated in the Figure 8, confirmed elegant
recovering and reusability of the Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3–urea–thiazole
sulfonic acid chloride in the model reaction.
