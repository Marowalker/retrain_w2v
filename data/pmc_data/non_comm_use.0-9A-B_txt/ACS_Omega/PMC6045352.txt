We
report on a novel strategy to tune the structural and optical
properties of luminescent alloyed quantum dot (QD) nanocrystals using
plasmonic gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs). Alloyed CdZnSeS
QDs were synthesized via the organometallic synthetic route with different
fabrication strategies that involve alternative utilization of blends
of organic surfactants, ligands, capping agents, and plasmonic oleylamine
(OLA)-functionalized AuNPs and AgNPs. Ligand exchange with thiol l-cysteine (l-cyst) was used to prepare the hydrophilic
nanocrystals. Analysis of the structural properties using powder X-ray
diffraction revealed that under the same experimental condition, the
plasmonic NPs altered the diffractive crystal structure of the alloyed
QDs. Depending on the fabrication strategy, the crystal nature of
OLA-AuNP-assisted CdZnSeS QDs was a pure hexagonal wurtzite domain
and a cubic zinc-blende domain, whereas the diffraction pattern of
OLA-AgNP-assisted CdZnSeS QDs was dominantly a cubic zinc-blende domain.
Insights into the growth morphology of the QDs revealed a steady transformation
from a heterogeneous growth pattern to a homogenous growth pattern
that was strongly influenced by the plasmonic NPs. Tuning the optical
properties of the alloyed QDs via plasmonic optical engineering showed
that the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of the AuNP-assisted l-cyst-CdZnSeS QDs was tuned from 10 to 31%, whereas the PL
QY of the AgNP-assisted l-cyst-CdZnSeS QDs was tuned from
15 to 90%. The low PL QY was associated with the surface defect state,
while the remarkably high PL QY exhibited by the AgNP-assisted l-cyst-CdZnSeS QDs lends strong affirmation that the fabrication
strategy employed in this work provides a unique opportunity to create
single ensemble, multifunctional, highly fluorescent alloyed QDs for
tailored biological applications.

Introduction
Nanotechnology is a
rapidly growing field, and novel nanostructured
materials with unique optical properties are needed to meet the demand
for the next-generation device materials. Hot-injection organometallic
pyrolysis of metal precursors, which is used to produce semiconductor
quantum dot (QD) nanocrystals via band gap optical engineering, has
become a mainstream fabrication technique to obtain QDs with unique
optical properties.1−3 Fixed metal precursor compositions4,5 and
stoichiometric variations in the metal composition are the two main
fabrication techniques used to engineer the band gap of alloyed QDs.6,7 For the fixed composition technique, a constant molar ratio of the
precursor material is usually used to tune the optical properties
of the alloyed QDs, whereas for the stoichiometric variation technique,
the molar ratio of two or more selected semiconductor metals is varied
to tune the optical properties of the resultant alloyed QDs. Both
of these techniques have been successfully applied to produce different
organic-phase ternary and quaternary alloyed QDs for solar cell applications,8,9 light-emitting diodes,10,11 and optoelectronic
applications.12,13 The choice of the fabrication
technique, precursor materials, and semiconductor metal components
is an important factor that influences the overall optical properties
of the resultant QDs.

Plasmonic optical engineering of QDs has
the potential to generate
nanostructured materials that can revolutionize research in the fields
of medicine, chemistry, biology, photonics, and optoelectronics. For
example, embedding QDs on a rough gold film surface generated unique
spectral characteristics, an excited-state lifetime that was 1000
times faster, and a 5-fold increase in the photoluminescence (PL)
intensity compared to that of the QDs alone.14−16 Furthermore,
plasmonic nanoparticle (NP)-QD core/shell hybrids have been developed
for Au–CdSe,17 Au–ZnS,18 Au–ZnSe, Au–ZnS/ZnSe, and Au–ZnSexS1–x.19 The reported Au–ZnSe, Au–ZnS/ZnSe,
and Au–ZnSexS1–x nanostructures19 were
hydrophobic while data on their PL properties were not reported. To
date, plasmonic NP-QD core/shell hybrids synthesized via the organometallic
hot-injection pyrolysis route have been hydrophobic and have also
exhibited poor optical properties because of the plasmonic NPs quenching
the fluorescence of the QDs, thus making them unsuitable for biological
applications.

Utilizing the precursor solutions of the single
ensemble QDs and
the plasmonic NPs in the same synthetic pot has been a challenge.
Another challenge is preserving the fluorescence of the QDs and generating
a high PL quantum yield (QY) after converting the hydrophobic nanocrystals
into hydrophilic nanocrystals. A breakthrough report by Jin and Gao20 demonstrated a layer-by-layer assembly technique
to form a single NP ensemble containing the fluorescence of CdSe/ZnS
QDs and plasmonic AuNPs. While a relatively moderate PL QY of 18%
was reported for the water-soluble plasmonic NP-QD nanostructure,
the preparation did not involve pyrolysis of the plasmonic NP and
QD metal precursors in the same synthetic pot. The strategy for achieving
this feat involves precise optical band gap engineering of the QDs
and plasmonic NPs by utilizing appropriate synthetic parameters. In
reality, synthesizing discrete fluorescent QD nanocrystals in the
quantum confinement regime with unique optical properties using plasmonic
NPs as precursors is extremely challenging, and the progress reported
to date has either been theoretical21 or
the formation of conjugated nanostructures has resulted in products
with insufficient optical properties.22

In this work, we report for the first time the organometallic
synthetic
fabrication of single ensemble fluorescent alloyed QDs assisted with
plasmonic NPs. Oleylamine (OLA)-capped AuNPs and AgNPs were synthesized
and utilized as precursor materials in a hot-injection organometallic
synthetic pot embedded with alternative blends of semiconductor metal
precursors, organic capping ligands, and organic surfactants. Then,
we converted the hydrophobic alloyed QDs into water-soluble nanocrystals
by replacing the organic-capped ligands with hydrophilic l-cysteine (l-cyst) thiol ligands. The structural and optical
properties of the optically engineered water-soluble alloyed QDs assisted
with plasmonic AuNPs and AgNPs were studied and are reported in this
work.

The l-cyst-capped, alloyed CdZnSeS QDs synthesized
using
the AuNP precursor are denoted as l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS, and those
synthesized using the AgNP precursor are denoted as l-cyst-AgCdZnSeS.
The samples also have subscripts with the PL emission wavelength to
distinguish among the different sizes.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Properties
The synthetic strategy employed
in this work was used to engineer the band gap of alloyed QDs created
using plasmonic NPs as a precursor material and to ascertain how the
synthetic process influences the resulting structural features. The
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show that the alloyed QDs
have well-defined crystalline patterns that depend on the morphology
and fabrication method. The cubic zinc-blende crystal structure was
observed for the l-cyst-capped AuCdZnSeS626, AuCdZnSeS638, AgCdZnSeS582, AgCdZnSeS612, and
AgCdZnSeS626 QDs (Figure 1A,B). For the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS626 and
AuCdZnSeS638 QDs, the initial Cd precursor solution with
cadmium oxide (CdO), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), octadecene (ODE),
and oleic acid (OA) was the same as that used for the synthesis of
both QDs, but the ligand hexadeylamine (HDA) was incorporated into
the solution for the AuCdZnSeS626 QDs. The ligand OLA and
the surfactant trioctylphosphine (TOP) were incorporated into the
solution for the AuCdZnSeS638 QD synthesis. An additional
notable difference in the fabrication strategy was the preparation
of the TOPSe precursor. The TOPSe precursor for the synthesis of the
AuCdZnSeS626 QDs was prepared in the presence of the surfactant
TOP, and the TOPSe precursor used for the synthesis of the AuCdZnSeS638 QDs was prepared in the presence of the surfactants TOPO
and TOP and the non-coordinating solvent ODE.

(A) alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs and (B) alloyed
AgCdZnSeS QDs and (C) representative EDX spectrum of the AuCdZnSeS626 QDs.

The cubic zinc-blende
crystal structure of both sizes of the QDs
exhibited three notable peaks with planes at {111}, {220}, and {311},
which demonstrated the strong crystallinity in the alloyed structure.
Because the concentration of the plasmonic AuNPs was constant in the
synthesis of the alloyed AuCdZnSeS626 and AuCdZnSeS638 QDs, the synthetic fabrication did not change the crystal
phase of the QDs. A different diffraction pattern with respect to
the hexagonal wurtzite characteristics was observed when the synthetic
fabrication process for the AuCdZnSeS662, AuCdZnSeS668, and AuCdZnSeS670 QDs was tweaked (Figure 1A). The Zn and S
precursors were used in a manner similar to that for the synthesis
of the AuCdZnSeS626 QDs, and the Se precursor was used
as described for the AuCdZnSeS638 QDs. In the initial Cd
precursor, the triotylamine (TOA) and tributylphosphine (TBP) precursors,
which were not incorporated into the system for the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS626 and AuCdZnSeS638 QDs, were added to the synthetic
process. An intriguing feature in the diffraction patterns of the
AuCdZnSeS662, AuCdZnSeS668, and AuCdZnSeS670 QDs is the absence of a superimposition of the zinc-blende
and wurtzite patterns, as a pure hexagonal wurtzite diffraction domain
was observed (Figure 1A). The synergistic effect of TOA and TBP along with the plasmonic
NP precursor had a profound effect on the phase change in the alloyed
QDs.

To determine if the synthetic fabrication method influences
the
diffraction pattern of the alloyed l-cyst-capped AgCdZnSeS
QDs, we utilized the same method used to fabricate the synthesis of
the zinc-blende and wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs. As shown in Figure 1B, the synthetic method used
for the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS638 QDs produced a similar
zinc-blende diffraction pattern for the AgCdZnSeS582 QDs,
and the synthetic method used for the wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs produced
zinc-blende AgCdZnSeS612 and AgCdZnSeS626 QDs.
This observation shows that the alloyed AgCdZnSeS QDs maintain the
same crystallinity regardless of the synthetic process, which is in
contrast with the observation for the alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs. Figure S1 shows a consistent zinc-blende diffraction
pattern for the alloyed QDs synthesized without a plasmonic NP precursor
when the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS638 fabrication process was
employed.

The diffraction pattern was also used to probe the
growth of the
zinc-blende and wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs. A direct correlation between
the width of the peak and the growth direction has been proposed by
Li and Peng.23 for zinc-blende CdSe QDs.
A sharp peak is attributed to the lateral direction, and a broad peak
is attributed to the short axis direction. For the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS
QDs, the sheet thickness corresponded to the [001] direction, and
the [001] and {111} directions corresponded to the short axis. The
{111} diffraction peak for the AuCdZnSeS638 QDs is a superimposition
of a sharp peak and a broad peak, which indicated the 2D nature of
the structure. Because of the anisotropic nature of the structure,
different widths and positions that do not completely overlap are
characteristic of the diffraction peaks with lattice planes that correspond
to different axial directions.24 Therefore,
the planes in the directions of {100}, {010}, and {110} can be attributed
to the lateral growth direction. Because of the asymmetric nature
of the wurtzite structure, the growth pattern proposed by Li and Peng
cannot be correlated to the wurtzite structure of the alloyed QDs
synthesized in this work. The diffraction pattern simulation by Li
and Peng for different orientations of wurtzite 2D CdSe QDs indicated
that if the lateral growth is along the [1120] and [0001] axes, the
thickness is in the direction of [1010]. Hence, the displayed diffraction
pattern exhibited sharp peaks at {002} and {110}. For the wurtzite
AuCdZnSeS QDs synthesized in this work, a similar diffraction pattern
was observed.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis
was carried
out to gain useful insight into the elemental compositions of the
semiconductor chalcogenide metals, and we have interpreted the result
based on the growth rate and the fabrication strategy employed in
this study. Table 1 provides the details of the elemental compositions of the alloyed
QDs, and Figure 1C
shows a representative EDS spectrum of the l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD626, and Figure S2 shows the elemental
mapping images of Cd, Zn, Se, and S metal chalcogenide for wurtzite
AuCdZnSeS and zinc-blende AgCdZnSeS QDs. On the basis of the fabrication
strategy used to generate the wurtzite diffraction pattern for AuCdZnSeS
QDs, the comparison of the elemental composition of l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS662, l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS668, and l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS670 QDs unraveled a steady decrease in
the Cd, Se, and S composition, while the Zn composition increased
relative to the particle size increase. The metal composition trend
obtained for AgCdZnSeS QDs shows that on the basis of the fabrication
strategy used to tune the size of the QDs, both the Cd and Zn composition
decreased as the size of the QDs increased, whereas the Se and S composition
showed no noticeable trend relative to the particle size. For the
CdZnSeS QDs synthesized without plasmonic NPs, the Zn content increased
relative to increase in the size of the QDs, whereas there was no
noticeable trend in the Cd, Se, and S content relative to the particle
size of the nanocrystal.

With respect to how
the elemental composition can be used to understand
the growth rate of the QDs, one can see that the Cd content of l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS662, l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS668, and l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS670 synthesized
from the same batch shows a Cd-rich alloyed system which depleted
as the size of the QDs grew. It implies that for wurtzite AuCdZnSeS
QDs, the depletion of the Cd-rich system with time in relation to
the particle size increase correlated conversely to a gradual formation
of a Zn-rich system, whereas for the zinc-blende AgCdZnSeS QDs, the
depletion of the Cd-rich system correlated precisely to the depletion
of the Zn-rich system.

To probe the particle morphology of the
alloyed QDs, we carried
out a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Figure 2 shows the representative TEM
images of OLA-AuNPs and the alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs, whereas Table 2 provides details
on the average particle size. Figure 2A shows that the OLA-AuNPs exhibited spherical, homogenous
particle morphology, as evident by their monodispersed nature. The
average particle size distribution, as shown in Figure 2A, was 5.0 ± 2.1. Figure 2B–F shows the representative TEM images
of the different-sized AuCdZnSeS QDs that were synthesized using OLA-AuNPs
as the precursor. As the QDs increased in size, the particle morphology
transitioned from a heterogeneous nucleation state to a homogenous
nucleation state. The spherical particle morphologies of the l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS662 (Figure 2D), l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS668 (Figure 2E), and l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS670 QDs (Figure 2F) exhibited improved particle dispersity
compared with those of the l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS626 (Figure 2B) and l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS638 QDs (Figure 2C). Figure S3 shows
the corresponding particle size distribution histograms, which reflect
the progressive increase in the particle size (Table 2) as the alloyed QDs were subjected to further
growth.

The OLA-AgNPs (Figure 3A), which were used as a precursor to synthesize the
AgCdZnSeS
QDs, had a particle size of 3.3 ± 1.7 and a spherical, monodispersed
particle distribution. A closer look at the TEM images of the AgCdZnSeS
QDs (Figure 3B–D)
and AuCdZnSeS QDs (Figure 2B–F) shows that the smaller, alloyed QDs exhibited
prolate heterogeneous particle morphologies that correlated to the
anisotropic growth25 and progressively
changed into a homogenous particle morphology as the particle growth
time increased. Interestingly, this transitional feature of the particle
morphology was not observed in the TEM images of the alloyed QDs (Figure 3E,F) that were synthesized
without plasmonic NPs. An additional feature is the distinct spherical
shape morphology of the alloyed QDs with precursor plasmonic NPs compared
with that of the alloyed QDs without precursor plasmonic NPs. The
corresponding particle size distribution histograms for the alloyed
AgCdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figure S4, whereas
those of the alloyed CdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figure S5.

The heterogeneous anisotropic growth in the smaller-sized
QDs with
precursor plasmonic NPs can be understood in terms of the slow reactivity
of the NPs and the low reaction temperature. This implies that at
lower reaction temperature (typically 200–240 °C), the
slow reactivity of the NPs would have prevented the uniform formation
of the QD nuclei throughout the entire synthetic solution. The heteroepitaxial
growth of the alloyed QDs under these conditions is kinetically controlled
and slow; that is, the rate-limiting step is the formation of CdZnSeS
at the surface along with the diffusion of the NPs. Therefore, the
wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs with homogenous nucleation and growth do not
favor anisotropic-type growth.

Photon correlation spectroscopy
or quasi-elastic light scattering,
that is, dynamic light scattering (DLS), was used to probe the hydrodynamic
sizes of the QDs in solution. The hydrodynamic size value was used
as a reference to probe the aggregation state of the nanocrystals.
If the alloyed QDs are polydispersed in a solution, the hydrodynamic
size will be larger than 100 nm. For a monodispersed colloidal solution,
the hydrodynamic size should be smaller than 100 nm. The DLS curves
for the different-sized, alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figure 4A–E, and those
for the AgCdZnSeS QDs and CdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figures S6A–C and S7A–C, respectively. The monodispersed
nature of the colloidal QD solutions was confirmed by their hydrodynamic
size values, which were smaller than 100 nm (Table 2).

Figure 4 DLS and ZP curves for the (A,A1) l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD626, (B,B1) l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD638, (C,C1) l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD662, (D,D1) l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD668, and (E,E1) l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS-QD670.

The colloidal stability of the
alloyed QDs was measured using the
zeta potential (ZP) curves of the alloyed QDs, as shown in Figure 4A1–E1 for
the AuCdZnSeS QDs, in Figure S6A1–C1 for the AgCdZnSeS QDs, and in Figure S7A1–C1 for the CdZnSeS QDs. A high colloidal stability is indicated by
a ZP value in the range of ±30 mV. Each of the alloyed QDs grown
with plasmonic NPs exhibited a high colloidal stability based on the
ZP values (Table 2),
which were in the range of −38.2 to −69.1 mV. The alloyed
QDs grown without plasmonic NPs also exhibited a high colloidal stability.
The precursor plasmonic NPs used in the synthetic fabrication of the
QDs did not alter the colloidal stability of the resulting nanocrystals.

Optical Properties
The UV/vis absorption spectra of
the OLA-AuNPs and OLA-AgNPs are shown in Figure 5A. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak,
which was narrower for the OLA-AuNPs, absorbed at ∼530 nm,
and a much broader SPR peak, which absorbed in the range of 438–456
nm, was observed for the OLA-AgNPs. The UV/vis absorption and PL emissions
of the different-sized alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figure 5B–F, and a
summary of the photophysical parameters, that is, the absorption maximum
wavelength, full width at half maximum (fwhm), and PL QY, is shown
in Table 2. To calculate
the PL QY of the QDs, rhodamine 6G was dissolved in ethanol and used
as a reference standard (ΦFlR6G = 0.95).26 The
equation below was used to evaluate the PL QY of the alloyed QDs  ΦFlQD is the PL QY of the alloyed QDs, ΦFlR6G is the PL QY
of the rhodamine 6G standard, FlQD and FlR6G are the sums
of the fluorescence intensities of the QDs and rhodamine 6G standard,
respectively, ODQD(λexc) and ODR6G(λexc) are the optical densities of the QDs and
the standard at the wavelength of excitation, respectively, and nethanol2 and nwater2 are the refractive indexes of the solvent
used to dissolve the standard and QDs, respectively.

The red-shifted PL emission
of the wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs within
the range of 626–670 nm is an indication of exciton delocalization
over the entire metal semiconductor chalcogenide because of the synergistic
effect of the precursor materials. The UV/vis absorption spectra for
the AuCdZnSeS QDs showed that the excitonic absorption peak for the l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS626 QDs was much narrower than that
for the other alloyed AuQDs. This can be attributed to an increase
in the growth time for the alloyed QDs rather than an increase in
the quality of the surface. Additionally, the fwhm of the AuCdZnSeS626 (48 nm) QDs was slightly larger than that of the other
alloyed QDs.

To understand how the synthetic method influences
the optical properties
of the different-sized, alloyed AuCdZnSeS QDs, an assessment of the
fwhm and the PL QY parameters was performed. Generally, a lower fwhm
and a higher PL QY indicate QDs with fewer surface defects and vice
versa. On the basis of a comparison of the fwhm and PL QY values (Table 2), the AuCdZnSeS668 QDs had the lowest fwhm and a relatively low PL QY (13%),
whereas the AuCdZnSeS662 QDs had a much higher fwhm and
the highest PL QY. Additionally, we determined that an increase in
the particle size of the wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs correlated to a spontaneous
decrease in the PL QY. An intriguing observation was the remarkable
PL QY of 90% and the corresponding fwhm of 56 nm exhibited by AgCdZnSeS612 QDs. On the basis of this assessment, a direct relationship
between the fwhm and the PL QY does not exist for the alloyed QDs.

QDs are shown in Figure 6A, which clearly reveal the presence of a deep trap emission in the
tail end of the PL emission peak; they followed the order of AgCdZnSeS582 > AgCdZnSeS626 > AgCdZnSeS612. The
extent of the deep trap PL emission is reflected in the resulting
PL QY and depicts the surface defect level in the alloyed nanocrystals.
A similar observation in the deep trap emission was also observed
for the alloyed CdZnSeS QDs synthesized without the plasmonic NPs
(Figure 6B). On the
basis of an assessment of the tail end of the PL emission peak of
the CdZnSeS QDs, the extent of the deep trap emission followed the
order of CdZnSeS568 > CdZnSeS586 > CdZnSeS630, and this precisely correlated with the resulting trend
in the PL QY. The plots of the particle size as a function of the
band gap and PL QY for the l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS, AgCdZnSeS and
CdZnSeS QDs are shown in Figure 6C–E. Because the band gaps of the alloyed AuCdZnSeS
and AgCdZnSeS QDs were tuned by the nature of the precursor materials,
the results show that the resulting photophysical properties are largely
affected by the synthetic method. The lower PL QY may be due to the
inherent presence of residual strain within the nanocrystal interface,
which may be due to a lattice mismatch between the semiconductor metal
components, whereas the higher PL QY may be due to relaxation of the
strain and radiative exciton recombination within the alloyed nanocrystals.

Viability Assay
The popular methyl
thiazolyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay27 was used to evaluate
the cytotoxicity of the alloyed QDs. The cell assay method was carried
out according to a previously published protocol by our group.28Figure S8A–C shows the cytotoxicity responses of selected l-cyst-CdZnSeS630, l-cyst-AuCdZnSeS662, and l-cyst-AgCdZnSeS612 QDs to HEK 296T cells. The alloyed
QDs with a high PL QY were selected for the cytotoxicity assay. For
the l-cyst-CdZnSeS630 QDs (Figure S8A) synthesized without plasmonic NPs, an excellent
cell viability was observed at both low and high dose levels with
the exception of 1 μg/mL. For the AuCdZnSeS662 QDs,
excellent cell viability was observed at dose concentrations of 1
mg/mL, 1 μg/mL, and 0.1 ng/mL, and for the AgCdZnSeS612 QDs, excellent cell viability was observed at dose concentrations
of 1 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, and 0.1 μg/mL. Generally, a cell viability
trend that correlated to the concentration of the QDs was not observed.

Mechanism of Plasmon-Assisted QD Growth
To understand
the growth mechanism of the plasmonic AuNP and AgNP-assisted synthesis
of CdZnSeS QDs with respect to transition in the morphological growth
of the particle from a heterogeneous state to a homogenous state,
we have utilized the LaMer mechanism, the Ostwald ripening, and digestive
ripening for illustration.29 The LaMer
mechanism involves a two-stage conceptual process of nucleation and
growth separation and can be divided into three stages: (1) increase
in the free monomer concentration occurs rapidly in solution; (2)
the concentration of the free monomer in solution is significantly
reduced because of burst nucleation. At this stage, the rate of nucleation
is ascribed as effectively infinite in which no nucleation occurs
after this period because of the depletion in the concentration of
the monomer; (3) after the nucleation process, the diffusion of the
monomer through the solution triggers the growth.30

For Ostwald ripening, the growth mechanism is triggered
by the change in the solubility of the nanocrystal which is dependent
on the QDs size. Hence, as a result of the surface energy and high
solubility of smaller particles in solution, the particles redissolve,
and this in turn enables the growth of larger particles. On the other
hand, digestive ripening is the inverse of Ostwald ripening in which
smaller particles grow at the expense of larger particles. This growth
process is also controlled by surface energy of the particles in solution
by which larger particles redissolve to in turn allow smaller particles
to grow.31

Considering the three
mechanisms presented, we can tentatively
eliminate the digestive ripening growth process for the plasmon-assisted
QDs synthesis because the QD nucleation and growth led to increase
in the particle size, thus leaving us with the LaMer mechanism and
Ostwald ripening mechanism. The study of the excitonic absorption
spectra of the QDs using UV/vis spectroscopy can shed light on the
nature of the nucleation and growth mechanism of the QDs considering
the influence of temperature on growth. For AgCdZnSeS QDs, the smaller-sized
QDs were obtained at a lower temperature and shorter time as compared
to the larger-sized QDs which were harvested at longer time and higher
temperature. The corresponding UV/vis absorption spectra reveal a
slight broadening of the maximum excitonic absorption peak as the
size of the QDs increased. This growth process fits strongly to the
Ostwald ripening mechanism. For AuCdZnSeS QDs, the monomer effect
seems to play a major role on the nucleation and growth of the nanocrystals
because of the exhibited differences in the diffraction pattern when
different fabricated strategies were employed. We envisage that the
phosphonic precursor materials can deoxygenate the AuNP precursor
and the OA or the other capping ligands to generate anhydride products.32 We envision that at relatively high temperature
(between 220 and 240 °C), the particles formed by LaMer burst
nucleation which was followed by rapid random attachment and by intraparticle
ripening, hence leading to a heterogeneous particle morphology. At
very high temperatures (>280 °C), the particle undergoes a
much
longer nucleation which was followed by slow growth, hence leading
to a homogeneous particle morphology.

Further Discussion on the
PL QY
Exploring the different
fabrication strategies, we tuned the PL QY of AuCdZnSeS QDs to a maximum
value of 31% and AgCdZnSeS QDs to a maximum value of 90%. We believe
that there are a number of reasons for the significant differences
in the PL QY. From the UV/vis absorption spectra of the different-sized
AuCdZnSeS (Figure 5B–F) and AgCdZnSeS QDs (Figure 6A), it is evident that the SPR peak of the plasmonic
NPs were buried under the strong excitonic absorption peak of the
QDs. The vital question is whether the utilization of the plasmonic
NPs as a precursor material will induce a radiative or nonradiative
fluorescent state in the QDs. A key characteristic to note is that
Au nanostructures are well-known fluorescence quenchers, and their
presence within fluorescent materials can inhibit photon transmittance.33 Because the PL QY of CdZnSeS QDs synthesized
without plasmonic NPs reached a maximum of 84%, it implies that the
presence of AuNP precursors in the synthetic process influenced the
low PL QY. One possible reason for this is that the Au3+ may have etched onto the QD surface and introduced surface traps
which suppressed the radiative exciton recombination state of the
QDs.

For AgCdZnSeS QDs which exhibited a remarkable PL QY, we
envision that the Ag+ had less accessibility to the QD
surface, thus allowing for more radiative exciton recombination states.
Another possible reason for the differences in the PL QY may be the
extent of spacing between the spectral overlap of the QDs fluorescence
and the SPR absorption peak of the plasmonic NPs. As shown in Figure 5A, the SPR peak of
OLA-AgNPs absorbs between 438 and 456 nm, whereas that of OLA-AuNPs
absorbs at ∼530 nm. We can tentatively conclude that the significant
overlap and the short separation distance between the AuNP SPR peak
and the QDs fluorescence suppressed the radiative exciton recombination
state in the resulting AuCdZnSeS QDs, whereas longer overlap and longer
separation distance between the AgNP SPR peak and the QDs fluorescence
favored radiative exciton recombination states in the resulting AgCdZnSeS
QDs.

Conclusions
In this work, we successfully engineered
for the first time the
band gap of alloyed quaternary CdZnSeS QDs with plasmonic NPs in an
organometallic synthetic pot embedded with organic surfactants and
coordinating ligands. The influence of the plasmonic NP precursor
on the QD growth morphology revealed a steady transition from a heterogeneous
growth pattern to a homogeneous growth pattern. Such a growth pattern
was not evident in the particle morphology of alloyed QDs synthesized
without plasmonic NP precursors. A strong structural influence was
unraveled in the crystal nature of the plasmonic NP-assisted alloyed
QDs, with results showing that under the same experimental conditions,
the alloyed QDs synthesized with plasmonic OLA-AgNPs exhibited a hexagonal
wurtzite structure, whereas the alloyed QDs synthesized with OLA-AuNPs
exhibited a cubic zinc-blende structure. A detailed analysis of the
optical properties indicated that the band gap of the plasmonic NP-assisted
alloyed QDs can be tuned across the visible region to the near-infrared
region. The variations in the PL QY lend strong evidence that depending
on the fabrication strategy and the nature of the plasmonic NP being
utilized, the alloyed QDs can attain a high radiative recombination
exciton state that correlates to a high PL QY.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Cadmium oxide (CdO), TOP, ODE, HDA, TOPO,
selenium (Se), TOA, TBP, diethylzinc (Et2Zn), sulfur (S),
OLA, rhodamine 6G, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, HAuCl4·3H2O, tannic
acid, silver nitrate (AgNO3), and l-cysteine were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (Saint Louis, MO, USA). OA was
purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Potassium hydroxide
(KOH), methanol, tri-sodium citrate, acetone, and chloroform were
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). An ultrapure
Milli-Q water system was used for the sample preparation.

Characterization
UV/vis absorption and fluorescence
emission measurements were performed using a filter-based multimode
microplate reader (Infinite F500, Tecan, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland).
TEM images were obtained using TEM JEM-2100F (JEOL, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
operated at 100 kV. PXRD measurements were carried out using RINT
Ultima XRD (Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) with an Ni filter and a Cu Kα
source. Data were collected from 2θ = 5–60° at a
scan rate of 0.01°/step and 10 s/point. ZP and DLS analyses were
performed using a Zetasizer Nano series instrument (Malvern Inst.
Ltd., Malvern, UK). EDS analysis was carried out using an SEM JEM-16036
LA instrument integrated with JED-2300 EDX.

Synthesis of the OLA-Capped
AuNPs and AgNPs
The plasmonic
NPs were synthesized by first capping them with citrate. The citrate-capped
AuNPs were synthesized by mixing 1 mL of 1% HAuCl4·3H2O with 79 mL of water and adding 20 mL of a solution containing
4 mL of 1% tri-sodium citrate with 0.5 mL of tannic acid and 15.5
mL of water.34 The solution was stirred
for several minutes at 60 °C. To form the citrate-capped AgNPs,
HAuCl4·3H2O was replaced with AgNO3, and the rest of the procedure for the citrate-capped AuNPs
was followed. A ligand exchange reaction was used to convert the hydrophilic
NPs to hydrophobic NPs by replacing the citrate with OLA. First, 2
mL of OLA was mixed with 20 mL of toluene and stirred for few minutes.
Then, 50 mL each of the citrate-capped AuNPs and the AgNPs was added
to the separate OLA–toluene solutions and stirred until the
OLA-capped NPs visibly separated from the hydrophilic layer. The solution
was centrifuged, and the top layer containing the OLA-NPs was removed
via a pipette.

Synthesis of the Zinc-Blende, Alloyed AuNP-Assisted
CdZnSeS
QDs
Organometallic hot-injection pyrolysis of the metal precursors
was used to fabricate the alloyed QDs using plasmonic NPs as the precursor
material (Scheme 1).
Both the metal precursors and the OLA-AuNPs precursor were utilized
in the same synthetic pot. To synthesize the zinc-blende, alloyed
AuCdZnSeS626 QDs, 0.4 g of CdO, 1.93 g of TOPO, 1.2 g of
HDA, 20 mL of ODE, and 15 mL of OA were stirred and heated up to >200
°C under a constant flow of Ar gas. Then, a premixed TOPS solution
containing 80 mg of S, 1.93 g of TOPO, 1 mL of TOP, 10 mL of ODE,
and 5 mL of OA was added into the Cd precursor solution and followed
by swiftly injecting a premixed TOPZn solution containing 2 mL of
Et2Zn, 1.93 g of TOPO, 1 mL of TOP, 10 mL of ODE, and 5
mL of OA. Next, 5 mL of the OLA-AuNPs and a premixed TOPSe solution
(2 mL) containing 60 mg of Se and 5 mL of TOP were added.

and Wurtzite, Alloyed CdZnSeS QDs with Plasmonic NP Precursors. Emission
Colors of the Alloyed QDs under UV Irradiation
To synthesize the zinc-blende, alloyed AuCdZnSeS638 QDs
and the TOPZn and TOPS precursor solutions were used as described
for the AuCdZnSeS626 synthesis. Briefly, 0.4 g of CdO,
1.93 g of TOPO, 2 mL of TOP, 5 mL of OLA, 20 mL of ODE, and 15 mL
of OA were first stirred and heated up to >200 °C under the
constant
flow of Ar gas. Then, a premixed TOPSe (5 mL) precursor containing
1.93 g of TOPO, 0.3 g of Se, 20 mL of ODE, and 1 mL of TOP was injected
into the Cd precursor and quickly followed by the addition of a premixed
TOPZn solution (5 mL), a TOPS solution, and the OLA-AuNPs solution
(5 mL).

Synthesis of the Wurtzite, Alloyed AuNP-Assisted CdZnSeS QDs
(Scheme 1)
To synthesize the alloyed, wurtzite AuCdZnSeS662, AuCdZnSeS668, and AuCdZnSeS670 QDs, the TOPZn and TOPS precursors
were used as described for the zinc-blende AuCdZnSeS626 QDs, and the TOPSe precursor was used as described for the zinc-blende
AuCdZnSeS638 QDs. Briefly, 0.4 g of CdO, 3.86 g of TOPO,
2 mL of TOP, 5 mL of TOA, 2 mL of TBP, 20 mL of ODE, and 15 mL of
OA were stirred and heated up to >200 °C under a constant
flow
of Ar gas. Then, the Cd precursor solution became clear, and the TOPSe,
TOPZn, TOPS, and OLA-AuNPs metal precursor solutions were added for
nucleation and growth of the alloyed QDs. The alloyed QDs were removed
at different time intervals.

Synthesis of the Alloyed AgNP-Assisted CdZnSeS
QDs
The synthesis of the alloyed AgCdZnSeS QDs using AgNPs
as the precursor
material was similar to that of the AuCdZnSeS QDs. The fabrication
method used to synthesize the zinc-blende, alloyed AuCdZnSeS638 QDs was used to synthesize the alloyed AgCdZnSeS582 QDs,
and the method used to synthesize the wurtzite AuCdZnSeS QDs was used
to synthesize the AgCdZnSeS612 and AgCdZnSeS626 QDs. OLA-AgNPs was used as the plasmonic NP precursor.

Synthesis of
the Alloyed CdZnSeS QDs without a Plasmonic NP
Precursor
The fabrication method used to synthesize the alloyed
AuCdZnSeS638 QDs was employed to synthesize the alloyed
CdZnSeS QDs without a plasmonic NP precursor in the growth solution.
Three sizes of QDs were removed from the solution at different time
intervals.

Ligand Exchange with l-Cysteine
The ligand
exchange reaction to replace the organic caps on the alloyed QD surfaces
with water-soluble l-cysteine ligand was carried out using
an l-cysteine–KOH–methanol–water solution.
A KOH–methanol solution was first prepared by dissolving 3.0
g of KOH in 40 mL of methanol, and then, 2.5 g of l-cysteine
was added. The mixture was sonicated until the cysteine completely
dissolved. Each of the alloyed QDs, with or without a plasmonic precursor,
was dissolved in chloroform and added to separate l-cysteine–KOH–methanol
solutions. This was followed by the addition of an appropriate volume
of water to facilitate an effective precipitation of the water-soluble
layer. The solution was stirred for several minutes and allowed to
stand overnight so an effective separation of the organic layer from
the water-soluble layer could occur. Purification of the nanocrystals
was carried out by centrifuging them in acetone and chloroform, and
a complete removal of the organic capping was carried out using a
chloroform–acetone–water mixture.
