Supercritical
fluids technology is a clean methodology to foam
polymeric materials. However, this technique provides only the formation
of inner porosity, whereas the so-called skin layer is commonly observed
at the polymer surface. This article describes a new method for the
preparation of outer and inner porous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)
scaffolds by combination of supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) foaming and the breath figures technique. In the first step,
experiments with a SCCO2 reactor were performed at 35–45
°C, 100–250 bar, and 1–20 min depressurization
time. The effect of these parameters in the formation of inner porosity
was investigated for an adequate optimization. In a late stage, to
provide also surface porosity to the polymeric samples and remove
the skin layer, the breath figures technique was employed. The evaluation
of porosity was determined by scanning electronic microscopy, mercury
porosimetry, and micro X-ray computerized tomography scanning processing
the images obtained with the ImageJ software. The results of this
study using these two complementary techniques showed the existence
of interconnectivity between inner and outer porosity of the samples.
Furthermore, thermal transitions and crystallinity of the PCL samples
have been analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. Finally,
a preliminary biological evaluation of the resulting scaffolds with
mouse endothelial cells (C166-GFP) was performed to assess their biocompatibility
and cellular viability.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Porous biodegradable polymer
scaffolds are being applied in tissue
regeneration processes1 as the number of
people who receive life-saving organs and tissue transplantation is
limited by a shortage of donor tissue. A great variety of biomaterials
as synthetic polymers, ceramics, and naturally derived proteins are
being used for the preparation of these scaffolds.2 Different techniques have been developed to fabricate these
polymers into porous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.3−5 In this sense, supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) is
a well-known technology to obtain porous structures of polymeric materials.
Its advantages with respect to other techniques rely on its green
character (CO2 is recyclable and elude the undesirable
use of organic solvents), low economical costs, easy achievable critical
points, nontoxicity, nonflammability, and easy control of the porosity
and pore size by the depressurization process when using the appropriate
temperature and pressure conditions.6,7 However, the
main disadvantage that this technique presents when foaming polymer
samples is the appearance of the so-called “skin layer”
which avoid the formation of external porosity. Regarding the skin
layer, the rapid diffusion of the embedded fluid out of the sample
edges results in the formation of this dense nonporous skin layer
that can be decreased, to a certain extent, by an increase in pressure.8

Different approaches have been carried
out to prevent the formation
of a skin layer and form an entirely porous structure. In that sense,
Mooney et al.9 incorporated NaCl particles
to the polymer solution of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) before gas foaming. The leaching of this
porogen after fabrication of the polymer foam created an interconnected
open pore network. Barry et al.10 in 2004
simply removed the skin layer from the scaffolds before cell culture
when they used the gas-foaming method to create poly(ethyl methacrylate)/tetrahydrofurfuryl
methacrylate foams. Hori et al.11 prepared
skinless polymer foams by treating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
with SCCO2, that is, by immersing the PMMA in SCCO2 with ethanol to nucleate, and then incubated in a hot water
bath to induce nuclear growth. The obtained polymer foams had a low
density, and cells were connected to each other to make channels through
the skin layer.

Our group described recently the preparation
of poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL) biodegradable porous membranes with outer and inner porosity
just by SCCO2 treatment, displaying surface hierarchical
macroporosity which could be tailored by careful control of the pressure,
in the range of 150–250 bar, and depressurization processes
in several steps, showing also pore interconnectivity between both
membrane faces. In this case, the thickness of the employed membranes
played an important role to obtain outer and inner porosity, as those
with thickness higher than 90 μm showed the appearance of the
so-called skin layer.12

In the present
work are combined the SCCO2 technology,
which provides the internal porosity, with the breath figures13 (BF) technique which affords the external porosity
in PCL samples independently of the sample thickness. This technique
is based on the short immersion of the porous samples in an organic
solvent in a moist atmosphere. During the evaporation of the thin
solvent layer deposited at the polymer surface, the interfacial temperature
decreases thus leading to water vapor condensation.14 The condensation process finally produces water droplets
at the sample surface which, after evaporation of both solvent and
condensed water, provide the external porosity. SCCO2 pressure,
temperature, and depressurization are crucial parameters that were
evaluated to obtain the internal porosity, as well as different immersion
times for the BF technique were employed to obtain connection between
the external and internal porosity. The thermal properties of the
foamed PCL are also described in terms of changes in glass transition
temperature, crystallinity, and melting point. Finally, cell culture
studies were carried out on the prepared porous PCL samples using
mouse endothelial cells analyzing the metabolic activity with a view
to possible applications in tissue engineering.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Control of the Internal
Porosity of the PCL
Scaffolds
Although all polymeric samples treated exclusively
with SCCO2 showed a nonporous outer skin layer with variable
thickness, the pore distribution as well as the average pore size
depends on the experimental conditions. Therefore, the optimization
of the inner porosity was carried out by varying three parameters:
temperature, pressure, and depressurization time.

The first
parameter explored was the temperature. Figure 1 shows the scanning electronic microscopy
(SEM) micrographs for samples prepared at different temperatures,
between 35 and 45 °C, keeping the pressure constant at 200 bar
and the depressurization time at 5 min. On the one hand, at 35 and
37 °C, no porosity can be observed in the center of the cylindrical
samples. At 35 °C, the thickness of the porous layer is about
400 μm, and at 37 °C, the thickness of the porous layer
is about 800 μm. The absence of porosity in the center of the
polymer is associated with the low temperature used. At this temperature,
the viscosity of the polymeric matrix (largely below the melting point
of PCL) is too high and limits the diffusion of CO2 within
the saturation time employed.15 This fact
can also be due to the noncompleted solubility of CO2 in
the polymer sample.

Figure 1 SEM micrographs for samples treated with SCCO2 at 200
bar, 5 min depressurization time, and different saturation temperatures:
(a) 35, (b) 37, (c) 40, and (d) 45 °C.

On the other hand, as depicted in Figure 1, at temperatures between 40 and 45 °C,
the polymer samples showed inner porosity in the whole fractured area. Table 1 shows the average
pore size of the samples for the different conditions employed. At
40 °C a more homogeneous distribution with an average pore size
of 77 ± 17 μm can be seen, while at 45 °C this value
is 106 ± 29 μm and the size distribution is more heterogeneous.
This observation can be related to a partial collapse of the pores
due to a process temperature close to the melting temperature of the
polymer after the absorption of CO2. The larger pore sizes
observed at 45 °C are due to the fact that the viscosity of the
polymer is lower and the gas diffusivity increases allowing the pores
to grow.15,16

E2-DP1200	40	200	20	195 ± 80	
As a result of the experiments depicted above, the temperature
employed for the rest of experiments was 40 °C, as at this value
pores are obtained in the whole sample while remaining below the melting
temperature. Interestingly, this temperature has also been selected
and used by other authors17,18 that employed PCL as
polymeric material.

The second parameter explored to control
the internal structure
of the PCL scaffolds was the pressure employed. In Figure 2, the SEM images of the porous
samples obtained varying the pressure employed are represented. At
100 bar (Figure 2a)
(the lowest pressure tested), a mixture of areas with rather large
pores (up to 500 μm in diameter) and solid areas can be distinguished.
Using these conditions, the SCCO2 has not been dissolved
enough to generate the appropriate number of nuclei that can grow
afterward. A rather homogeneous distribution can be observed in the
fractured area for the other three experimental pressures (Figure 2b–d). Moreover,
the average pore size decreases when the pressure increases (Table 1). This effect is
associated with an increase in dissolved CO2 in the polymer
matrix, which generates more available nuclei for the formation and
growth of the pores. As a consequence, more pores showing smaller
size are generated.15

Figure 2 SEM micrographs for samples
treated with SCCO2 at 40
°C, 5 min depressurization time, and different saturation pressures:
(a) 100, (b) 150, (c) 200, and (d) 250 bar.

Finally, the third experimental condition analyzed was the
depressurization
time. In Figure 3,
the different SEM images obtained by varying the depressurization
time are depicted. When the depressurization time increases, that
is, depressurization takes place at slower rate, the average pore
size also increases (see also Table 1). The reason for this observation is that the nucleation
process competes with the growth of the pores, as a result of the
gas diffusion through them. On the one hand, when the depressurization
rate is high, nucleation takes place faster and a great amount of
pores are generated. The development of each pore will occur fast,
so that the effects of diffusion will be negligible, and the resulting
structure will have an uniform pore size distribution. On the other
hand, when the nucleation process is slow, the resulting pores will
be bigger than the rest because of a higher diffusion of the gas,
and the final structure will have a larger pore size distribution.19

°C, 200 bar and different depressurization times: (a) 1, (b)
5, (c) 10, and (d) 20 min.

2.2 Analysis of the Pore Interconnection
A major requirement for the application of porous materials for cell
growth is the formation of interconnected pores that enable the cells
to migrate and simultaneously permit the flow of nutrients inside
the scaffold. As depicted in Figure 4, both closed pores as well as a majority of interconnected
pores have been observed in the cross section SEM micrographs of the
samples. Besides, the high porosity values obtained by mercury porosimetry
(Table 2) revealed
the existence of connection between the pores. It is important to
note that non-interconnected pores would not have permit mercury to
fill all the free space in the sample. Interestingly, it is worth
mentioning that porosity increases when pressure increases at a given
depressurization time and can be, therefore, modulated.

200 bar and 10 min depressurization time and (b) 250
bar and 5 min depressurization time.

Although, by micro-computerized tomography, it has
also been possible
to show the good interconnection between de inner pores, we will discuss
these analyses in the next section.

2.3 Effect
of SCCO2 on the Thermal
Transitions and Crystallinity of the Polymer
Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were made to determine the influence
of the SCCO2 on the thermal transitions of the processed
porous PCL. For comparative purposes, as a control sample, a nontreated
PCL was employed and the measured Tg was
−60 °C and the Tm was 73 °C,
while the crystallinity was 50.6%. Table 3 shows the values obtained for a selection
of samples, and it can be observed that the Tg in all cases is very similar to the one of the control sample,
with variations between −62 and −59 °C. Nevertheless,
the changes observed in the Tm are greater,
going from 6 to 14 °C less than the untreated PCL independently
of the pressures employed or the depressurization times used. The
difference between the thermal transitions after the BF technique
in comparison to the ones just treated with SCCO2 under
same conditions is also negligible. Regarding the crystallinity, it
was observed that, in general, these were higher in comparison to
the control PCL. This behavior, also reported by other authors,17,20,21 can be explained due to the fact
that the experimental temperature is close to the Tm, resulting in a higher mobility of the chains, thus
enabling the polymer chain reorganization and improving the crystal
formation. It is also note worth that the Tm decrease can be attributed to the formation of smaller crystals,
as they do not have enough time to crystallize as bigger ones.

2.4 Surface Porosity and Interconnection with
Inner Porosity
After the optimization of the parameters of
the SCCO2 technique, tests were conducted to study the
formation process of the pores on the surface of the scaffolds by
the BF technique. This study was focused on the samples obtained at
250 bar saturation pressure and 40 °C temperature which were
the most homogeneous in terms of pore size. The interconnection of
the pores was studied by SEM (Figures 5 and 6) and by microcomputerized
X-ray tomography (Figure 7).

the SCCO2 technique; and size of the superficial pores

between inner and outer
pores for a sample treated at 40 °C, 250 bar, 5 min depressurization
time and 8 s immersion in CHCl3. (a) Cross section and
(b) vertical section of the sample.

From the SEM analysis of the samples shown in Figure 5, it can be observed that for
immersion times between 5 and 7 s in CHCl3, in areas where
the dense skin layer thickness is in the range of 10–30 μm,
the pores formed at the surface are clearly interconnected with those
inside the sample (Figures 6 and 7). This means, for samples treated
with SCCO2 at high pressures (250 bar) and long immersion
times for BF, connection between inner porosity (SCCO2)
and outer porosity (BF) is obtained. For 1 and 3 s immersion time,
that is, shorter immersion times, the solvent did not penetrate the
skin layer and the interconnection did not occur. Additional experiments
were carried out at longer immersion times (from 8 s until 30 s) to
study whether the interconnection can be still improved (see Figure 6). For samples treated
with SCCO2 under the same conditions (250 bar, 40 °C
and 5 min depressurization time), the connection between the inner
and the outer pores is appreciable with no significant differences.
From 10 s onward, the effect is not further improved because a wide
(ca. 300 μm) nonporous outer layer is formed. This effect of
the immersion time may be due to two different reasons. On the one
hand, the outer skin of the polymer has been, at least to some extent,
dissolved in CHCl3, reducing the thickness of the dense
skin. On the other hand, the swelling of the PCL surface by the CHCl3 employed and its evaporation leads to deeper pores.

Another interesting aspect to be observed is the differences in
terms of pore size obtained by the SCCO2 technique and
BF. Although BF generally form pores with sizes ranging from 5 to
20 μm, foaming with SCCO2 produced larger pores (50–150
μm for the conditions used in this work). This aspect can be
advantageous in tissue engineering due to the fact that small pore
sizes improve cell response on the surface, while inner bigger pores
allow that, after cell seeding, the tissue penetrates in the scaffold
and improves the integration of the material until its degradation.22

2.5 Evaluation of the Cell
Adhesion and Biocompatibility
of the PCL Porous Scaffolds
To test suitability of the PCL
scaffolds for tissue engineering purposes, a cytocompatibility assay
has been performed. Endothelial C166-GFP cell line has been used,
because of their autofluorescence and its optimal behavior in terms
of cell growing over biomaterials.

After 7 days of culture,
all samples allowed endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. As
it can be observed in Figure 8, nontreated PCL scaffolds allowed only small cell clumps
proliferation, supporting a reduced number of cells with a poorly
attached morphology over their surface. Nevertheless, this situation
changed for the three treated PCL samples. It was possible to detect
bigger cell colonies adhered in the PCL surface and inside the pores,
at several depth levels (Figure 8b–d). Especially, cell proliferation was increased
over E4-P250-5 and E4-P250-10, where endothelial cells located and
grew into interconnected scaffold cavities.

PCL, (b) PCL after SCCO2 at 40 °C, 150 bar, 5 min
depressurization time, and 7 s in CHCl3, (c) PCL after
SCCO2 at 40 °C, 250 bar, 5 min depressurization time,
and 7 s in CHCl3, and (d) PCL after SCCO2 at
40 °C, 250 bar, 10 min depressurization time, and 7 s in CHCl3. (e) alamarBlue metabolic assay after 7 days of culture.

In addition, a metabolic activity
study of these samples was also
performed to quantify cell proliferation. As a result, all scaffolds
showed similar values of cell activity (Figure 8e), demonstrating that treatment did not
decrease biocompatibility. On the contrary, a slight upward trend
was detected over specific scaffolds, such as E4-P250-5.

Regarding
these preliminary biological results, double SCCO2 and
BF techniques over PCL scaffolds improved cell behavior
in comparison with nontreated PCL. This finding suggests an interesting
application in bone and cartilage tissue engineering purposes. On
the one hand, PCL characteristics include high mechanical strength,
bioresorbability, and a proper degradation rate compatible with bone
tissue proliferation.23 On the other hand,
the introduction of inner and surface porosity in bone implants has
shown to increase cell culture activity.24 Moreover, after bone matrix synthesis, sample–tissue interface
is enhanced, improving implant fixation and promoting final success.
Although endothelial cell results are interesting by themselves, mainly
because vascular growth is also needed in these bone regenerative
applications, a deeper study including osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts
and specific differentiation markers would ensure this clinical use.

3 Conclusions
The combination of BF and supercritical
fluids (SCCO2) techniques allows the preparation of PCL
porous scaffolds with
interconnected outer and inner porosity. Their inner porosity was
obtained by SCCO2 treatments by keeping the temperature
constant at 40 °C, decreasing the pore size when increasing the
pressure, and increasing when slowing the depressurization rate, showing
all samples an outer skin layer. SCCO2 porous scaffolds
were found to be interconnected. The SCCO2 treatment effect
on the PCL thermal transitions showed constant Tg and Tm and crystallinity
slightly increased. By BF, samples previously treated by SCCO2 at 40 °C and 250 bar were submitted to different CHCl3 immersion times (up to 10 s), providing surface porosity
that was found by SEM and micro X-ray computerized tomography scanning
analysis, to be connected to the inner one, showing pores from 5 to
20 μm by BF and from 50 to 150 μm by SCCO2.
Finally, preliminary cell adhesion and biocompatibility of the porous
scaffolds exhibited good cell adhesion and proliferation into the
interconnected scaffolds, maintaining the biocompatibility and improving
cell behavior with respect to nontreated PCL.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PCL (50 000 g mol–1) was supplied by Perstorp. Liquid carbon dioxide was purchased from
Carburos Metálicos with a 99.99% purity. Chloroform (CHCl3) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Preparation
of the Samples
The samples
were prepared by extrusion of PCL pellets. The process conditions
were 60 °C and velocity, with a nozzle diameter of 3 mm. In each
experiment, three samples were tested at the same time and placed
in 4 mm diameter tubes to keep the cylindrical shape.

4.3 Preparation of the Porous Structures
4.3.1 Inner
Porosity
PCL cylinders were
placed in a SCCO2 reactor (Thar R100W, 104 mL) which operated
under different conditions: 35–45 °C temperature, 100–250
bar pressure, and 1–20 min depressurization time. The SCCO2 system consists of a CO2 tank, which delivers
CO2 to a high pressure pump precooled using a cryostat
at 4 °C, reaching the reactor at the desired pressure and temperature.
The system remained at these conditions for a processing time of 90
min using a CO2 flow of 5 g/min for all the cases and then
depressurization takes place until atmospheric pressure.

4.3.2 Superficial Porosity
Samples with
different inner pore sizes (between 50 and 150 μm) were chosen
to obtain superficial porosity by the BF technique. For this purpose,
PCL cylinders pretreated with SCCO2 were immersed during
different times (1–30 s) in chloroform under saturated relative
humidity (over 90%) conditions at room temperature in a closed chamber.
The samples were left to dry inside the chamber for 24 h.

4.4 Characterization
4.4.1 Determination
of Pore Size
The
porous scaffolds were frozen in liquid nitrogen and fractured. Their
cross sections were analyzed by SEM (XL30ESEM Philips) at an accelerating
voltage of 25 kV. The morphology of the pores, the thickness of the
skin layer (in the case of samples treated only by SCCO2), and the average pore size were determined by this technique. SEM
micrographs were analyzed with the ImageJ software. Average pore sizes
were determined by measuring the diameter of 30 pores of the image
and obtaining their average and standard deviation.

4.4.2 Mercury Porosimetry
The determination
of the percentage of porosity was performed using the unit PoreMaster-33,
Quantachrome Instruments.

4.4.3 Computerized Tomography
The interconnectivity
of the pores was studied by computerized tomography with the unit
CT-SCAN-XT-H-160 (Nikon). This technique allows to take two-dimensional
images while the sample rotates 360° and to obtain a volumetric
three-dimensional reconstruction with the proper software.

4.4.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal transitions
and crystallinity of the samples were analyzed
by DSC (Mettler Toledo DSC 822e). The polymer was heated from −90
to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The melting temperature, Tm, was determined using the value of the endothermic
transition peak, and the glass transition temperature, Tg, was taken as the middle point of the transition. The
percentage of crystallinity was calculated through the ratio between
ΔH and ΔH0.

4.5 Biological Studies
4.5.1 Cell
Culture and Cell Seeding
The
cell studies were carried out using C166-GFP, a mouse endothelial
cell line (ATCC CRL-2583). For culturing cells on the scaffolds, the
endothelial cells were seeded singly over the samples in supplemented
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and the polymers
were placed in a 24-well plate in maintenance medium, incubated at
37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For experiments
on PCL scaffolds, cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/scaffold,
and three scaffolds of each sample type were used for each experiment.
Samples were observed and fluorescent images were captured at 168
h using an Olympus BX51 microscope.

4.5.2 Metabolic
Activity Study
Metabolic
activity of cells was measured by alamarBlue assay at 72 and 168 h.
AlamarBlue dye (10% of the culture volume) was added to each well,
containing living cells seeded over samples, and incubated for 90
min. The fluorescence (λex/λem 535/590
nm) of each well was measured using a plate-reader (Synergy HT, BioTek).
