The conversion of poplar wood biomass to highly value-added
chemicals and molecular building blocks was achieved by using the
dispersed mixed oxide Zn3V2O8 (ZVO)
in water under 100 kPa of 10% O2/N2 at 160,
180, and 200 °C for 4 h. This nanostructured mixed oxide was
prepared via the precipitation process and then characterized by several
techniques. The results showed that this mixed oxide has interesting
catalytic properties and is a versatile catalyst for biomass delignification
and lignin and hemicellulose depolymerization. ZVO exhibited high
activity on poplar biomass delignification and fractionation (degree
of delignification > 97%) and lignin and holocellulose conversion
with high yield into aromatic and furan compounds (80 mg/g initial
wood at 200 °C), with high selectivities for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) (25 mg/g of initial wood), vanillin, and syringaldehyde.

Introduction
Lignocellulosic biomass utilization as
a source of clean energy and chemicals has attracted attention in
recent years in the context of the fossil fuel energy crisis and the
clean energy drive.1,2 Lignocellulosic biomass consists
of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin fractions (Scheme 1), which quantitatively and
qualitatively vary according to the plant material. Hemicelluloses
serve as a connection between lignin and cellulose fibers and give
the whole cellulose–hemicelluloses–lignin network more
rigidity.3,4 Unlike cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin
is a cross-linked hydrophobic polymer5 that
is insoluble in most solvents and fairly resistant to anaerobic degradation.
Hence, a pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to dissolve the
lignin structure (delignification) and cleave the chains seems to
be necessary before enzymatic and chemical–thermal processes
to avail important chemicals from biomass. Delignification of the
lignocellulosic biomass has been investigated in many studies, for
example, recently in the production of Kraft pulps, lactic acid, and
bioethanol.6−9 The obtained fibrous material is composed mainly of cellulose (80–90%),
hemicelluloses (5–15%), and lignin (2.5–4%). The industrial
pulping technologies deal mainly with sulfur-based reagents, while
the bleaching technologies are mainly chlorine-based. Both have a
negative impact on the environment. A disadvantage of these pretreatment
methods is that, for example, during the subsequent anaerobic and
chemical degradation, hydrogen sulfide is formed, lowering the quality
of the produced biomolecules. Recently, molecular oxygen delignification
in alkaline media has been widely reported as a potential technique
for lignin degradation due to its low process cost and its energy
efficiency.6,7,10,11 In this process, effects of sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), oxygen pressure, and
temperature on decomposing lignin have been reported. A review of
the oxygen delignification literature indicates that a co-oxidant
and/or catalyst is most frequently used in the delignification and
pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass.6,10,12,13 An alternative
means of enhancing the degree of delignification in an oxygen delignification
process is to develop novel catalysts that could increase lignin degradation
by oxidation in water without adding large amounts of chemicals. The
use of recyclable bimetallic dispersed oxides for the fragmentation
of lignocellulosic biomass in water (pH = 7) limits problems derived
from equipment corrosion owing to the mild pH of the reaction media
and also reduces the operational costs since no further neutralization
is needed.

Products Obtained from the Catalytic Fragmentation of a Lignocellulosic
Matrix in Water over a Zn3V2O8 (ZVO)
Catalyst
Transition-metal vanadates are a significant
category of mixed oxides that have received lively interest, notably
for their big potential for applications in photocatalysis, materials
for electrochemical energy storage, superparamagnetic compounds, and
high-performance microwave devices.14−18 Various mixed oxides of this family have been synthesized.
Here, we quote mainly zinc vanadate (Zn3V2O8 (ZVO)), which will be this paper’s subject. ZVO has
attracted considerable interest for high-technology applications.19,20 On the other hand, in the catalysis area, few works have been published
on the use of this kind of material in photocatalysis. Mondal et al.
have developed a distinctive method for ZVO synthesis with a rare
cubo-octahedral morphology.21 Then, ZVO
was exploited as a photocatalyst for the photodegradation of several
organic dye molecules under UV-light irradiation and with a high turnover
number (TON). More recently, a facile, rapid, and solvent-free method
to synthesize nanostructured ZVO has been reported.22 The authors of this study have highlighted the impact of
the nature of the precursors used on the material morphology. The
main ZVO synthesis methods reported in the literature are sol–gel23 hydrothermal method,19 co-precipitation,24 and solid-state synthesis.20 However, to the best of our knowledge, no study
on the use of ZVO in heterogeneous catalysis for biomass upgrading
has been reported yet. Herein, ZVO was synthesized, characterized,
and used for the fractionation and conversion of poplar wood biomass
via the depolymerization of lignin and carbohydrates.

Results and Discussion
Material Characterization
Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the poplar
wood sample we used in this study. Its average composition (dry weight
basis) was 45% cellulose, 23% lignin, 23% hemicelluloses, and 10.2%
others. This chemical composition is in good agreement with other
values found in the literature. The degree of lignification was estimated
by the Klason lignin and acetyl bromide methods. The cellulose content
was estimated from the amount of glucose in the Klason lignin hydrolysates.
The hemicellulose content was estimated from the amounts of xylose,
arabinose, galactose, mannose, and uronic acids. Lignin is an aromatic
polymer in which the guaïacyl (G)- and syringyl (S)-propane
monomer units are connected by both C–O–C and C–C
linkages, with carbonyl and methoxy functional groups. Poplar wood
lignin is composed of G and S units with an S/G ratio of 1.36. The
β–O–4 linkage (alkyl aryl ether, the most abundant
structure in native lignin) content, determined by thioacidolysis,
was 2350 μmol/g of lignin (Table 1), in agreement with previous works.5,25 Hence,
the cleavage of C–O–C bonds and C–C bonds (β–O–4,
β–5, β–β, 5–O–4, and
5–5) of G- and S-propane units are important factors in chemical
lignin depolymerization.

Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of a representative sample
(Zn3V2O8) obtained after its calcination
at 550 °C. This analysis shows only one phase corresponding to
the orthorhombic phase of ZVO (Zn3V2O8), which is consistent with JCPDS card No. 34-0378. The lattice parameters
are a = 8.306 Å, b = 11.540
Å, and c = 6.117 Å. The XRD pattern depicts
that no impurities detectable by XRD are produced during the synthesis
via the co-precipitation route. The peaks are relatively broad, which
is characteristic of nanocrystalline particles. The average crystalline
size was determined from the XRD spectrum by Scherrer’s equation
using EVA software. We obtained a size of 63 nm.

Figure 1 X-ray diffraction pattern
of ZVO.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of ZVO is 34 m2/g and its pore volume is 0.001609
cm3/g. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of ZVO is of types
III and IV (Figure S1), displaying the
hysteresis loop H3 in the relative pressure range of 0.85–0.95
and plateaus in the adsorption branches, indicating its intergranular
porosity due to the formation of aggregates of plate-like particles
forming slit-like pores. We note that the adsorbed volume remains
low until P/P0 equals
0.85, which corresponds to the constitution of a molecular monolayer.
The adsorption of N2 is progressively increased to constitute
a monolayer covering the entire external surface of the ZVO pores.

Figure 2a,b shows
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZVO under both magnifications.
These images of the as-obtained mixed oxide after calcination indicate
a porous nanoplatelet-like morphology. The porous ZVO nanoplatelets
have coarse surfaces. From these images, we can see that the porous
nanoplatelets are composed of many ZVO nanocrystals. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of ZVO revealed that the sample
is well-nanostructured with an irregular morphology due to the particle’s
loose assemblage (Figure 2c,d). This observation can be explained by the Ostwald ripening
phenomena. The particles of ZVO are very fine, and so they are agglomerated
in the form of a superstructure (average size at ca. 100 nm), but
they are well-dispersed (Figure 2c).

Catalytic Fractionation and Conversion of Wood Biomass
The catalytic experiments were performed in a batch reactor, at 160,
180, and 200 °C, in water (pH = 7) with 10% O2/90%
N2 as the oxidant. The reactions were catalyzed by dispersed
ZVO. After that, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate
the insoluble fraction, which was then freeze-dried to yield the “residue”
fraction. The low-molecular-weight aromatic molecules (lignin) and
furans (polysaccharides) were first extracted from the supernatant
with dichloromethane (DiCl) and then identified and quantified by
gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass detection. The aqueous phase
(WSol) was also analyzed and quantified using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (Scheme 2). Figure 3 shows the distribution of the products of poplar biomass fractionation
within the “residue”: “WSol” and “DiCl”
fractions. The catalytic reaction of delignification and fragmentation
of lignocellulosic biomass performed with ZVO/O2 as the
catalyst system at 200 °C yielded 290 mg/g of residue, 368 mg/g
of WSol, and 126 mg/g of DiCl compared, respectively, to 414, 325,
and 74 mg/g without ZVO. The results of catalytic delignification
and fractionation of biomass indicate clearly that the ZVO mixed oxide
is an excellent heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidative fragmentation
and depolymerization of lignin to aromatic monomers, with diluted
oxygen, under a relatively low pressure.

fraction (DiCl) in catalytic experiments performed with ZVO oxide
and without the catalyst in water (pH = 7), with 10% O2/90% N2 (100 kPa) as the oxidant at 160, 180, and 200
°C.

Scheme 2 Catalytic Fractionation Scheme of Poplar Wood Biomass
GC–mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis
of the DiCl fractions was conducted to identify and quantify the yield
of the major low-molecular-weight products (aromatics and furans)
(Figure 4 and Table 2). In this study,
the ecofriendly delignification of polar biomass and cleavage of lignin
polymers by dispersed oxides “in situ” in the presence
of oxygen gave several new products, such as alkylbenzenes, benzaldehyde,
benzoic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, phenol, guaïacol, syringone,
acetophenone, and syringaldehyde (Table 2). The various compounds in the DiCl fraction
were determined quantitatively by GC using standards under every reaction
condition. Some products (e.g., catechol) may have been converted
into gas, but the gas product was not analyzed. Kruse et al. have
suggested that pyrocatechol could be converted into gases at high
temperatures.26

fraction (DiCl) in catalytic experiments performed with or without
ZVO oxide as the catalyst in water (pH = 7), with 10% O2/90% N2 (100 kPa) as the oxidant at 160, 180, and 200
°C.

Catalytic Oxidation over ZVO in Water (100%, pH = 7) under 100 kPa
of 10% O2/90% N2
Figure 4 shows the yield of the DiCl fraction obtained after the reaction
with ZVO in water at different temperatures for 240 min. Over
ZVO at 200 °C, for 240 min, poplar wood biomass delignification
exceeded 97% (Table 3), with lignin conversion to identified aromatic compounds exceeding
56 mg/g of biomass compared to only 32 mg/g of biomass without ZVO.
This suggested that the lignin–wood matrix is more depolymerized
“in situ, in biomass” over ZVO oxide compared to extracted
lignin, which can be attributed to the high β–O–4
linkage content of the wood lignocellulosic matrix described in previous
works.27−29 The depolymerization of wood–lignin polymers
over ZVO mixed oxide in water under oxygen at 160, 180, and 200 °C
showed, respectively, 8, 15, and 24% w/w conversion of the initial
lignin in wood.

The catalytic oxidation of C–O–C bonds
in the lignin polymer released vanillin, phenol, benzoic acid, and
syringaldehyde as the major products, although intermediate products
of oxidation and decomposition of these compounds were obtained in
different amounts depending on the reaction conditions. The depolymerization
of biomass by ZVO in water (100%, with 10% O2/90% N2 as the oxidant at 200 °C) showed 18.07, 20.61, 13.53,
7.86, 5.92, and 4.31% selectivities to vanillin, syringaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF), phenol, acetosyringone, and benzoic acid, respectively. Aromatics
represent about 24% w/w of the initial lignin (Table 2 and Figure 4). These results indicate that the combination of ZVO
with the O2 oxidant greatly improved the biomass delignification
and lignin depolymerization “in situ” for functional
monomer production in comparison with previous works (Table S2).

The catalytic reaction of delignification
and fragmentation of lignocellulosic biomass performed with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst system was carried out at three different
temperatures: 160, 180, and 200 °C. After dichloromethane extraction,
the water-soluble fractions yielded
(WSol) were analyzed.

Figure 5 shows the chemical composition of the water-soluble
fraction (WSol), which contained a mixture of sugar oligomers, monosaccharides
(xylose and glucose), organic acids (acetic acid, formic acid, etc.),
furfural, HMF, and some phenols. All of them were detected by HPLC,
as described before. It was found that the composition of these compounds
depended on the catalytic reaction conditions. Most of the hemicelluloses/cellulose
found in the liquid fraction were found as oligomers, representing
65–70% of the liquid fraction depending on the severity of
the treatment (Figure 5). Cellulose mostly remained in the residue (66–80% of the
initial cellulose), and only a small part was depolymerized into oligomers,
glucose, or HMF. The maximal percentage of soluble gluco-oligosaccharides
recovered from cellulose varied from 4 to 15% of the initial cellulose
when the temperature varied from 160 to 200 °C. Less gluco-oligosaccharides
and glucose were released from the most lignified materials. In contrast,
hemicelluloses are readily depolymerized and dissolved at the different
temperatures that we used in this study. Xylan is the main component
in the hemicelluloses of the poplar wood we used. The maximal yield
of xylan solubilization in the form of xylo-oligosaccharides was obtained
after 4 h at 160 °C, in comparison with the experiments performed
at 180 and 200 °C. Increasing the temperature resulted in lower
xylo-oligosaccharide yields, especially at 200 °C. Garrote et
al.30 and Conner et al.31 reported that the percentages of xylo-oligosaccharide recovery
from eucalypt wood and hardwood were estimated respectively to be
65 and 69%. Liu and Wyman32 also reported
that the disappearance of xylan increased at both temperatures and
confirmed that xylan is mostly solubilized as oligomers. The yield
of xylo-oligosaccharides obtained in this study varied from 48 to
27% of the initial xylan when the temperature changed from 160 to
200 °C, in good agreement with the different cited studies. In
addition, the residual xylan varied from 36 to 4% of the initial xylan
when the temperature changed from 160 to 200 °C. The yields of
xylose and glucose released in the liquid fraction (WSol) were not
high because these compounds readily converted to furfural and organic
acids under a high temperature and pressure. Dehydration of carbohydrates
and carbohydrate-derived molecules encompasses an important class
of reactions in the field of sugar chemistry. As shown in Scheme 1, sugars can be dehydrated
to form furan compounds such as furfural and HMF, which can be further
converted into organic acids or other products. The liquid fraction
contains some furans and phenolic compounds formed respectively from
carbohydrates and lignin, which are not well-separated on HPLC. During
the catalytic reaction, lignin was depolymerized and a small fraction
of low-molar-mass phenolics dissolved. A part of the lignin is known
to be covalently bound to xylan. Therefore, some xylo-oligosaccharides
might contain such phenolics. Figure 5 also shows the distribution of phenols, furans, and
organic acids in the liquid fraction from catalytic experiments of
delignification and fragmentation of poplar wood as a function of
temperature. The total recovery of the phenols and furans from catalytic
reactions increased with increasing temperature to reach 10–25%
of the liquid fraction when the temperature increased from 160 to
200 °C. The thermal catalytic reaction of pentoses and hexoses
leads to the formation of three interesting molecule platforms: furfural
(2-furancarboxaldehyde) arising from the dehydration of pentoses (i.e.,
xylose), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) arising from the dehydration
of hexoses (i.e., glucose), and levulinic acid formed from the hydration
of HMF. The bimetallic dispersed-oxide-catalyzed dehydration leads,
besides HMF and furfural, to traces of various other products, such
as 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (FDC), levulinic acid, succinic acid,
and formic and acetic acids arising from the hydration and oxidation
of HMF and furfural.33−35 The yield of organic acids increases from 2 to 15%
of the liquid fraction when the temperature changes from 160 to 200
°C. Figures 4 and 5 show the yield of furan derivatives extracted with
dichloromethane at different temperatures. A significant amount of
HMF was produced during the catalytic oxidation with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst system at 200 °C, with yields of 25 mg/g of
initial wood compared to only 14 mg/g without ZVO (Figure 4 and Table 2). The yield decreased to 4 mg/g at 160 °C
due to the crystalline structure of cellulose, which normally starts
to dissolve in water at high temperatures (≥180 °C) under
neutral conditions. The results show the formation of FDC, amounting
to about 0.5 mg/g of initial wood by oxidizing HMF in water with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst system. In contrast, a small production of
furfural was observed at the lowest temperatures, with a maximum of
1.8 mg/g of initial wood at 180 °C. It is likely that furfural
and HMF are catalytically converted at high temperatures into organic
acids and light products through a sequential oxidation pathway, in
good agreement with the organic acid concentration observed in the
liquid fraction. HMF is one of the new interesting molecules derived
from lignocellulosic biomass. The most versatile intermediate chemicals
of high industrial potential that can be generated from HMF in simple
large-scale transformation are 2,5-furandicarboxylic acids and FDC.

Figure 5 Recovery
(mg/g of wood) of organic acids, monosaccharides, and oligosaccharides
in the water-soluble fraction (WSol) in catalytic experiments performed
with ZVO oxide and without the catalyst in water (pH = 7), with 10%
O2/90% N2 (100 kPa) as the oxidant at 160, 180,
and 200 °C.

The dehydration of hexoses (sugars-C6) into HMF has been studied in water, organic solvents, biphasic
systems, ionic liquids, and near-critical or supercritical water,
using a variety of catalysts.36,37 The results shown on Figures 4 and 5 clearly indicate that dispersed bimetallic oxides “ZVO”
with oxygen as the oxidant could be a promising technology for converting
carbohydrates in water into HMF and diesel fuel additives. Figure 6 shows the molecular-weight
distribution of the water-soluble fraction (WSol) obtained by the
noncatalytic delignification/fragmentation of wood performed in water
(100%, pH = 7), with 10% O2/90% N2 (100 kPa)
at 200 °C, and performed by dispersed ZVO oxide in water (100%,
pH = 7), with 10% O2/90% N2 (100 kPa) at 160,
180, and 200 °C. UV detection was used to quantify phenols and
furans in the samples, while a refractive index (RI) detector was
used to quantify carbohydrates. The molar mass distribution in WSol
obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Figure 6) was similar for all oligosaccharides,
showing several molecular peaks (Mw) in
various proportions, which depended on the reaction conditions. It
can be seen in Figure 6 that a fraction of the products was of very small molecular mass
(40–300 g/mol), including degradation products, and that mono-
and disaccharides were mostly present at 160 °C. The presence
of oligosaccharides (300–6000 g/mol), especially at 200 °C,
was in agreement with the recovery yield of oligosaccharides from
treated wood at 200 °C in the presence of ZVO/O2 (Figure 5). The UV elution
profiles represent the UV-absorbing materials (such as some furans,
phenols, etc.). This confirms that some oligosaccharides might contain
such phenolic and/or absorbing functional groups (oxidation of OH
groups of monosaccharides), especially after the treatment at 200
°C, in agreement with the concentration of furans and phenols
determined in the liquid fraction. The fragmentation of lignocellulosic
biomass in water (pH = 7) with bimetallic dispersed oxide takes place
in slightly acidic media due to the partial cleavage of glycosidic
bonds, followed by successive reactions of oxidation and dehydration
that release furans, organic acids, and functional oligosaccharides.
By controlling the temperature and reaction time, it is possible to
influence the characteristics of the oligosaccharides such as their
molar mass distribution. The catalytic fragmentation of biomass in
water could also be a promising technology for converting agro-food
byproducts into useful food ingredients, for example, functional oligosaccharides.
The yield of the residue fraction from catalytic experiments of delignification
and fragmentation of poplar wood as a function of temperature is shown
in Table 3. The total
recovery of the residue from catalytic reactions decreased with increasing
temperature to reach 35–55% of the initial wood. The resulting
residue contained a mixture of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin.
The recovery of these biopolymers is highly dependent on the severity
of the experiments, for example, temperature, which is in agreement
with previous reports.6,13,38 In all experiments, most of the cellulose remained in the residue
at different temperatures. The total cellulose yield in the solid
phase recovered from wood after catalytic reaction varied from 79.2
to 65.6% of the initial cellulose when the temperature changed from
160 to 200 °C. In contrast, the lignin and xylan contents of
the residue fraction decreased respectively from 16 and 17% under
low-severity conditions to 2 and 3% under high-severity conditions.

Figure 6 Molecular-weight
distribution of the water-soluble fraction (WSol) obtained by the
noncatalytic delignification/fragmentation of wood (a) performed in
water (100%, pH = 7), with 10% O2/90% N2 (100
kPa) at 200 °C, and (b, c, d) with ZVO in water (100%, pH = 7),
with 10% O2/90% N2 at 160, 180, and 200 °C
respectively.

The experiments showed that more than 60% of the
initial lignin and hemicelluloses could be found in the liquid fraction
(as free phenols, xylose, furfural, HMF, organic acids, or oligosaccharides).
However, when the wood was treated with ZVO/O2 as a catalyst
system at 200 °C for 4 h, the lignin and xylan were more depolymerized
than at 160 and 180 °C and in experiments realized without a
catalyst. Analyses also showed that the chemical composition of the
residue fraction from wood treated at 200 °C with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst system was 65.6% cellulose, 2.6% xylan, and 2.0%
lignin. These results explain the better delignification of wood obtained
at 200 °C for 4 h when performed with ZVO (≥97) (see Table 3). The degrees of
delignification of wood obtained with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst
system at different temperatures in water were better in comparison
with those reported in the literature. When aspen wood chips were
steam-exploded at 205 °C for 5 min, a delignification degree
of 67% was obtained after dioxane–water (9:1) extraction.39 However, when
molybdovanadophosphate was used as the catalyst for wood delignification
for 5 h at 100 °C, pH = 1.8, under 70 kPa PO2, the
degrees of delignification were 64 and 78% in water and water/EtOH
(50/50, v/v), respectively. It is remarkable to observe that under
mild conditions [water; pH = 7; p(O2)
= 10 kPa; 4 h] with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst, lignin was
totally depolymerized into low- and high-molecular-weight products,
which can be developed in other technological applications.

Significant changes in the FTIR spectra can be seen
according to the reaction conditions. Figure 7 shows that the intensities of xylan bands
at 1738 cm–1 and lignin bands at 1511,4 1268,9 and 1244 cm–110 decrease significantly
when the temperature increases from 160 to 200 °C. Infrared spectroscopy
has previously been used to determine the lignin content in pulp,
paper, and wood.41,42 The 1505–1515 cm–1 peak is often taken as a reference for lignin and the 1738, 1158,
or 898 cm–1 peaks as the polysaccharide reference.
Rodrigues et al. used FTIR spectroscopy to quantitatively determine
lignin in Eucalyptus globulus using
carbohydrate peaks at 1160 and 898 cm–1 as references
against lignin peaks at 1505 and 1330 cm–1.42 The average relative intensities of lignin peaks
at 1511 cm–1 against carbohydrate peaks at 1375,
1160, and 897 cm–1 were calculated using peak areas
for residue fractions recovered from wood treated at 160, 180, and
200 °C in the presence of ZVO/O2 for 240 min (Figure S2). The increase of the lignin-to-carbohydrate
ratio with temperature confirmed xylan and lignin depolymerization
during the reaction catalyzed by ZVO. The depolymerization of lignin
and xylan polymers to monomers and oligomers during the catalytic
reaction performed with ZVO/O2 as the catalyst system is
in agreement with preceding results. In the case of the residue recovered
from wood treated with ZVO/O2 at 200 °C, many similarities
can be seen between the spectrum of the residue and that of microcrystalline
cellulose (Figure 7), indicating a selective removal of xylan and lignin. This suggests
that the solid fraction consists essentially of cellulose (∼96%)
with some lignin and xylan impurities, in agreement with sugar analysis.
Furthermore, reactions catalyzed at 200 °C by ZVO in the presence
of O2 produced high-molar-mass oligosaccharides and high
concentrations of HMF, vanillin, syringaldehyde, etc. without modifying
the cellulose (∼66% of the initial cellulose). Lignin was chemically
depolymerized during the catalytic delignification process, by the
cleavage of β–O–4 linkages and/or demethoxylation.
We calculated the ratios of the height of lignin peaks at 1511 cm–1 against peaks at 1462 and 1425 cm–1 (due to C–H and the deformation of methyl and methylene).
The ratios of the peak heights at 1511 and 1462 decreased from 0.74
to 0.72 and 0.62 at 160 and 180 °C, respectively, whereas at
200 °C, this ratio was lowered down to 0.22 after catalytic delignification
of wood in the presence of the ZVO/O2 catalyst system (data
not shown). In contrast, the ratio between peaks at 1511 and 1427
cm–1 decreased linearly from 1.55 with untreated
wood to 0.59, 0.28, and 0.03 after treatment in the presence of ZVO/O2 at 160, 180, and 200 °C, respectively (data not shown).
There was only a small decrease in the 1511 vs 1462 peak height ratio
after reactions at 160 and 180 °C in comparison with the catalytic
reaction performed at 200 °C, which may be due to lignin demethylation
rather than due to the cleavage of lignin β–O–4
linkages and xylan depolymerization. It is evident that the alkylation
reaction with methanol results certainly from demethoxylation by the
cleavage of C–O–C aromatic bonds of the methoxy group −C–O–CH3.43 The high decrease in the I1427/I1511 ratio
may be attributed to the cleavage of lignin β–O–4
linkages and xylan glycosidic bands, as observed in preceding results
(Figures 3–5).

Mass Balance
Figure 8 shows the mass balance of wood fractionation in the
presence of ZVO/O2 at 200 °C, which resulted in high
lignin yields. This confirmed the efficiency of this system for lignin-biomass
depolymerization. Based on the method used by Cheng et al.,44 the proposed process showed a yield of 79.7%
of the initial mass of poplar biomass, which is a good mass balance
for the lignocellulosic biorefinery process.45 The residue obtained in this experiment (Figure 3) was composed of 29.56% cellulose, 2% lignin,
and 2.6% xylan. The corresponding delignification reached 97%, and
the hemicellulose removal was estimated to be 88%. A mass loss of
21% detected was corresponding to 15, 4, and 0.7% of cellulose, hemicelluloses,
and lignin, respectively. These results confirmed that this lack corresponds
only to holocellulose-rich residues, which is due probably to the
separation and recuperation of the residue “cellulose”
and the catalyst using different washing and filtration steps for
different conditions (Figure 3).

Figure 8 Mass balance for the fractionation process with the ZVO catalyst
at 200 °C.

Catalytic Performance and Reuse of the ZVO System
The
obtained results confirmed that the cleavage and depolymerization
of lignin in situ (one pot: extraction + depolymerization) is a better
strategy for lignin conversion to value-added chemicals compared to
the depolymerization of extracted lignin. Indeed, lignin conversion
depends on its chemical structure, the presence of guaïacyl
(G monomer) and/or syringyl (S monomer) units, the yield of β–O–4
linkages, the polarity, the acidity of the medium, and the catalytic
performance of the catalyst system.

To explain and understand
the catalytic performance of the ZVO system in biomass delignification
and depolymerization, the elemental composition of the obtained ZVO
was examined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Figure S3 shows the presence of three elements
zinc, oxygen, and vanadium with a V/Zn ratio of 0.86. The surface
compositions and chemical states of ZVO before and after catalysis
(200 °C) were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
survey spectrum (Figure 9a) illustrates the correct chemical composition of the as-prepared
ZVO, apart from the C 1s signal peak that appeared at ca. 284.78 eV
corresponding to impurities formed during the analysis or the carbone
formed upon calcination. The peaks of the three constituent elements
of ZVO, such as Zn (Zn 2p3/2), V (V 2p3/2),
and O (O 1s), appeared, respectively, at 1021.37, 517.04, and 530.16
eV. Figure 9b shows
the high-resolution Zn 2p spectrum. Thus, the two binding energies
at about 1021.37 and 1043.9 eV could be fairly attributed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn2+, respectively.46 The highest binding energy peaks located at
approximately 524.8 and 517.5 eV (Figure 9c) are the result of V 2p1/2 and
V 2p3/2, respectively. These satellite peaks are characteristic
of the presence of V5+ ions.47 In addition, the O 1s core-level peak from the lattice oxygen in
ZVO was detected at ca. 530.1 eV (Figure 9c). However, it is highly probable that there
is an electronic dynamic exchange between zinc and vanadium, which
leads to the exceptional catalytic performance of ZVO.

Figure 9 XPS spectra of the (a)
survey spectrum, (b) Zn 2p, and (c) V 2p and O 1s.

The possibility to reuse the catalyst was also
studied successfully, and ZVO retained its catalytic performance (Table 5). To obtain information
on the stability of the catalyst as well as
its catalytic activity, this nanostructured mixed oxide was recycled
under conditions similar to those used for the delignification/depolymerization
(200 °C, 100 kPa, 4 h). The catalyst was recovered after reaction
(see the Experimental Section), washed, and
dried at 100 °C for 24 h. It was tested in a new experiment,
under the same conditions (Table 5). However, some conclusions were inferred from these
tests: (i) a small decrease in the delignification degree was observed
with the recovered ZVO in comparison with the freshly prepared ZVO;
(ii) also, a small decrease in lignin conversion was observed with
68 and 62%, respectively, for run #2 and run #3, while freshly prepared
ZVO showed 78% conversion; and (iii) no effect was observed on the
reaction selectivity by using recovered ZVO (Table 5).

and Selectively of the Major Products Resulting from the Poplar Wood
Biomass Catalytic Oxidation over Recovered ZVO in Water (100%, pH
= 7) under 100 kPa of 10% O2/90% N2
To understand this phenomenon, we also analyzed the
recovered ZVO by XRD and SEM. From a mechanical stability point of
view, the structure of ZVO is unchangeable, according to XRD and SEM
analyses (Figures S4 and S5), which will
inevitably eliminate the fouling theory of ZVO. XPS characterization
of the recovered ZVO reveals that the three
constituent elements of ZVO retain their degrees of oxidation, which
explains the retention of an almost stable catalytic activity of ZVO.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel nanostructured catalyst
based on zinc vanadate mixed oxide (ZVO) was successfully synthesized
via a co-precipitation process followed by heat treatment. Indeed,
we have shown that ZVO is an oxide with exceptional catalytic performance
and with an interesting selectivity for oxidative depolymerization
of biomass. Poplar wood biomass was converted via this catalytic process
into highly value-added chemicals and polymers. The influence of some
reaction conditions was examined. The highest conversion of lignin,
cellulose, and hemicellulose depolymerization was achieved at 200
°C
for 4 h. Oligosaccharides and aromatic and furan compounds were obtained
as the major components. This gives rise to new performing catalysts
for the cutting-edge biorefinery industry.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of ZVO
An aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 (0.1 M) was mixed with a 0.1 M aqueous solution of
NH4VO3 in a beaker at room temperature. A concentrated
solution of NH4OH was added dropwise to adjust the pH to
10, and then the mixture was stirred and heated at 80 °C for
4 h on a hot plate. The white precipitate was filtered, washed with
deionized water, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
The obtained powder was further heated in a muffle furnace at 550
°C with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min for 4 h.

General Procedure for the Catalytic Depolymerization of Biomass
The poplar wood biomass used in this study was ground using knife-milling
(Retsch SM 100, Germany) with a screening size of 1 mm. The experiments
were developed using a 50 mL stirred batch reactor (Parr 5000). The
treatments of all samples were carried out in deionized water at 160,
180, and 200 °C with 10% O2 in 90% of N2 for 4 h of reaction. The reactions were catalyzed using 80 mg of
ZVO for 400 mg of poplar wood biomass dispersed in 10 mL of deionized
water. The concentration of wood in the reactor was 40 g/L. These
conditions were chosen from previous experiments.48 After the completion of the reaction, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture by decantation (due to the low
density of ZVO) followed by filtration on fine filters. We note that
it was difficult to recover the entire quantity of the catalyst from
the solid residue. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged (20 min,
4000 tr/min), and the residue was separated from the liquid phase
(Scheme 2), washed
with water, and dried at room temperature. The final volume of the
liquid product (WSol) was obtained by combining
the liquid phase and washing water. The WSol fraction (Scheme 2) was treated with dichloromethane
(4 × 30 mL) to extract the lower-molecular-weight products such
as phenolic compounds and furans obtained from the lignin and carbohydrate
depolymerization. The organic layer (DiCl) was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residues were
dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane in the presence of an internal
standard for GC–MS analysis as described below. The rest of
the water-soluble fraction (WSol, Scheme 2) was concentrated and analyzed by HPLC and
GPC to quantify the mono- and oligosaccharides and organic acids.

The selectivity of the obtained products was calculated using the
following equations:      The recovered catalyst was washed twice with
dichloromethane and water and dried at 100 °C for 24 h before
being reused in subsequent reactions to demonstrate its prolonged
activity.

Materials and Apparatus
Metallic salts, reagents, and
solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further
purification. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained at room
temperature on a Bruker AXS D-8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
in the Bragg–Brentano geometry (θ–2θ). Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) pictures were recorded on a FEI Quanta 200
microscope after carbon metallization. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was conducted with a Tecnai G2 microscope at 120 kV. Gas adsorption
data in N2 were collected using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1
automatic analyzer. Prior to N2 sorption, all samples were
degassed at 100 °C overnight under dynamic vacuum conditions.

Specific surface areas were determined from the nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms at 77 K using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were
carried out in an ESCALAB 250 Thermo Electron spectrometer equipped
with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν
= 1486.6 eV).

The composition of the solid sample was determined
using strong-acid hydrolysis of the carbohydrates. The lignin content
in samples was determined by the Klason and Bromure acetyl methods.
Dried samples of 100 mg were treated with 72% H2SO4 at ambient temperature for 1 h. The solutions were diluted
with water to 12% H2SO4 and autoclaved at 100
°C for 1 h. The hydrolysates were centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. The Klason lignin content was determined as the weight
of the residue.

The supernatant was analyzed for sugars by high-pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC analysis was used to quantify the
acetic acid, monosaccharides, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF). The analysis was performed with a Water system, using a BioRad
HPX87H column at 60 °C (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The solvent was
0.005 M H2SO4 and the flow rate 0.5 mL/min.
The recovery of monosaccharides, furans, and organic acids was determined
by standard addition (d-fucose) to the samples. An ultraviolet
diode-array detector and a refractive index (RI) detector were connected
in series. The UV detector was used to quantify phenols, furfural,
and HMF in the samples, while the RI detector was used to quantify
carbohydrates. The system was calibrated with glucose, xylose, arabinose,
organic acids, furfural, and HMF standards (Sigma-Aldrich). Before
measurements, all of the samples (2 mL) were filtered through 0.22
μm filters.

The liquid fraction (WSol) consisted of both
oligomers and monomers resulting from the catalytic degradation of
lignin and polysaccharides. Phenolic and furan compounds isolated
from the liquid fraction (WSol) by liquid-phase extraction with dichloromethane
(DiCl) were identified and quantified using a GC–MS system
equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm SLP-5MS column.
The GC–MS analysis was carried out with decosane as an internal
standard using Thermo scientific GC/MS-2010. Helium gas was employed
as a carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The heating
of the column started at 80 °C, and was programmed to 250 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 10 min. The compounds obtained
were grouped as aldehydes, acids, ketones, phenols, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons. A sample of the water-soluble fraction (WSol) was analyzed
by HPLC directly to quantify the free monosaccharides, organic acids,
furfural, and HMF.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used
to measure the molar mass distributions of oligomers in WSol samples.
In all of the cases, a sample of 1.2 mL of the filtered liquid was
mixed with 0.2 mL of a solution of 0.35 M NaNO3, containing
0.02% NaN3. The GPC analysis was performed with a Shodex
SB 801–804 column in series at 40 °C using 0.05 M NaNO3, containing 83 mg/L NaN3, as the solvent at a
flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The system was calibrated with narrow standards
of pullulan.

Oligosaccharides in the WSol fraction were quantified
using HPLC. The WSol sample was hydrolyzed using 12% H2SO4 at 100 °C for 1 h to convert oligomers to their
constitutive monomers and analyzed by HPLC to quantify the total content
of oligomers in the sample. The lignin associated with the oligosaccharides
was measured as acid-soluble lignin and was estimated from the absorbance
of the solution between 260 and 280 nm. All analyses were performed
in triplicate.50−54

Lignin polymers were degraded by thioacidolysis to estimate
the G/S/H ratio and the content of β–O–4 linked
structures according to Lapierre’s procedure.26,49 The main degradation products were analyzed by GC as TMSi derivatives
using a J&W Scientific column (DB 1, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm
film), a flame ionization detector (FID), and tetracosane as the internal
standard.

FTIR spectroscopy was performed on 2 mg of the dry
sample carefully mixed with 100 mg of dry KBr and pressed into a self-supporting
pellet. FTIR measurements were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27
infrared spectrometer. For each sample, 32 spectra were accumulated
between 4000 and 400 cm–1 and averaged. The resulting
spectra were normalized to the highest peak in the fingerprint region
between 2000 and 800 cm–1.
