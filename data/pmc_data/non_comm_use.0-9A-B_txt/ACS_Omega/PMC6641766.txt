A series of optically
active polyamides, PAnLATs
(n = 9–12), were prepared by polycondensation
of l-tartrate-derived diacid with achiral aliphatic diamines
in which the number of the methylene is from 9 to 12. The monomers
could be obtained easily, and the synthesis of the polyamides is facile.
The number-average molecular weight (M̅n) of PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT is 35 500,
24 400, 35 800, and 20 900 g/mol, respectively,
and the related polydispersity index is 3.4, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.0. These
polyamides display intense optical activity in solution. Particularly,
the stronger ellipticities and different circular dichroism (CD) images
were presented when the polymers were evaluated in the solid state.
The crystalline properties of the polymers were studied to illuminate
the enhanced aggregation-induced CD. Moreover, PA9LAT and PA11LAT
have similar crystal parameters, and PA10LAT is similar to PA12LAT,
which revealed why the chirality of the polyamides displays an odd–even
effect. On the other hand, the solubility of the polymers in organic
solvents was studied, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyzer
was utilized to characterize the thermal properties.

Introduction
Complicated and tightly
controlled polymerizations, difficulty
in obtaining monomers, and expensive chiral catalysts or initiators
are the limiting factors for the achievement of polymers with optical
activity, such as polyacetylenes,1,2 polyisocyanates,3,4 and polyethylenes,5 which have been obtained
by additional polymerization of unsaturated monomers substituted with
chiral pendants. If the chiral polymers with desired optical activity
can be achieved directly by introducing chiral monomers into the backbone,
the preparation will be simplified significantly. In fact, natural
macromolecules such as proteins, peptides, and polysaccharides consist
of chiral constitutional units, and their formation processes occur
in the specific living system. Moreover, if the chiral monomers occur
naturally, the methodology will be of further significance because
the monomers are renewable, easily available, inexpensive, and environmentally
friendly, to name a few. Nevertheless, the naturally occurring chiral
sources such as amino acids and aldaric acids are always saturated,
which are unsuitable for additional polymerization, but suitable for
polycondensates, such as polyamides and polyesters.6−8 Furthermore,
there are few reports related to the development of the polymers with
desired chirality through the introduction of chiral atoms into the
backbone. In fact, it is a challenge to avoid the racemization and
intramolecular compensation when introducing the chiral pools into
the backbone, especially for linear aliphatic polyamides. The preparation
of polyamides with optical activity has received considerable attention
in recent years.9 However, success has
been achieved so far only in a limited number of aromatic polyamides
bearing chiral side chains on the nitrogen atoms,10,11 and the linear aliphatic polyamides with optical activity are very
scarce. In addition, the practical applications of optically active
polymers are commonly in the solid phase. Therefore, the evaluation
in the solid state could directly provide chiral information about
the optically active materials and make it more reliable for practical
applications. Especially, circular dichroism (CD) is regarded as one
of the most powerful and efficient techniques for chirality analysis.12,13

Takeishi et al. synthesized aromatic polyamides with a helical
structure by introducing axially dissymmetric biphenylene into the
backbone.14,15 Yokoyama and coworkers prepared poly(p-benzamide)s bearing chiral side chains on the nitrogen
atoms, which exhibited CD signals in solution, and the helical conformations
were investigated by the study of oligo(benzamides) with different
repeating units.10 Bou and co-workers have
developed tartaric acid-based polyamides synthesized by polycondensation
of bis(pentachlorophenyl)-tartarates with activated diamines, N,N′-bis(trimethylilyl) derivatives,
under rigorous exclusion of moisture and a relatively long polycondensation
time (3–4 days); these polyamides display specific rotation
in solution, but there is no report on the optical activity in the
solid phase.16,6,17

In this work, a series of optically active polyamides (PAnLATs) were prepared by polycondensation of 1,9-nonamethylenediamine,
1,10-decamethylenediamine, 1,11-undecanediamine, and 1,12-dodecanediamine,
respectively, with l-2,3-di-O-acetyltataic
dichloride (l-ATC) via interfacial polymerization. To investigate
the chirality of the polyamides, we researched the optical activity
of these polyamides both in solution and in the solid state. The crystallization
of the PAnLATs was characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns. In addition, the solubility and thermal stability
were investigated to compare the polyamides with different numbers
of the methylene in the aliphatic diamine segment.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of PAnLATs
The reaction
strategy to obtain PAnLATs is outlined in Scheme 1. To obtain linear
polyamides, the hydroxyl groups of l-tartaric acid (l-TA) were protected via O-acetylization to form l-2,3-di-O-acylatedtartaric acid (l-ATA). l-ATC was prepared by using bis(trichloromethyl)carbonate
(BTC) as the chlorination agent to enhance its reactive activity to
the diamines. 1,9-nonamethylenediamine, 1,10-decamethylenediamine,
1,11-undecanediamine, and 1,12-dodecanediamine were selected as diamines
for the synthesis of PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT, respectively.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR, and elemental
analysis were utilized to corroborate the chemical structure of PAnLATs.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route Leading to PAnLATs
(n = 9–12)
The infrared spectra display sharp absorption peaks at
around 1760,
1660, and 1540 cm–1. The first peak arises from
the ester side group, and the other two arise from the amide group.
The absorption at 3320 cm–1 represents the N–H
stretching vibration. The absorption of the methoxy side group is
observed at 1200 cm–1. The methylene stretching
vibration is evidenced by the two sharp absorption peaks at 2930 and
2850 cm–1 (Figure S1).
The specific 1H NMR spectroscopies of the four polyamides
are shown in Figure S2. The chemical shifts
and related protons are described in detail in the Supporting Information. In short, 1H NMR spectra
confirm definitely the chemical structure of PAnLATs
and exhibit the expected peak area. The elemental analysis data of
PAnLATs are listed in Table 1. The calculated components are consistent
with the theoretical values.

To achieve polyamides with a high
molecular weight, we prepared
the same concentration ratio of diamine and diacid chloride and operated
the removal of films continuously. In addition, to facilitate the
solubility of the long-alkylene diamines in the aqueous phase, first,
ethanol was used to dissolve the diamines and then a certain amount
of water was added to obtain the aqueous phase. The molecular weights
for each polymer are shown in Table 1, and the gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) curves
of PAnLATs are shown in Figure S3. M̅n values of PA9LAT,
PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT are 35 500, 24 400, 35 800,
and 20 900 g/mol, respectively. The related PDIs are all around
3.0. As a result, PAnLATs with a large molecular
weight were obtained successfully.

Solubility of PAnLATs
The solubility
of PAnLATs is shown in Table 2. PAnLATs are all soluble
in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which
can dissolve almost all aliphatic polyamides. Moreover, PAnLATs are soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and N,N′-dimethyl formamide (DMF), which cannot dissolve
unsubstituted aliphatic polyamides. DMF can be used as the eluent
for GPC measurements. However, these polyamides are insoluble in TFE
and dimethylacetamide (DMAc). In addition, the polymers are slightly
soluble in ethanol. Specifically, the solubility of PA11LAT in ethanol
at 20 °C is 9.48 × 10–3 g/mL, whereas
for PA9LAT, PA12LAT, and PA10LAT the solubility in ethanol is 9.06
× 10–3, 4.86 × 10–3,
and 4.28 × 10–3 g/mL, respectively. Thus, the
solubility of these polyamides is enhanced notably with respect to
that of unsubstituted polyamides, that is, nylon11,11. PAnLATs with polar ester side groups favor solubility in organic polar
solvents, apparently because the side groups disrupt the intermolecular
associations.

Thermal Properties of PAnLATs
The
thermal stability of PAnLATs was evaluated by thermogravimetry
under nitrogen flow, and the results are shown in Figure 1. According to the chemical
structure of PAnLATs, the contents of the acyloxy
groups in the polymers are 33.13, 31.88, 30.72, and 29.63%, respectively,
for PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT. When heated to 250 °C,
the weight loss of the polymers is around 30%, which is consistent
with the contents of the acyloxy groups. Thus, the lower-temperature
decomposition peaks at around 220 °C correspond to the release
of the acyloxy side groups. The main chain scission is thought to
take place in the second decomposition step at around 450 °C.

thermal analysis traces (weight
loss: solid line; decomposition rate: dashed line) of PAnLATs.

Optical Activity of PAnLATs Both in Solution
and in Solid State
The specific optical rotations ([α]D20) of the polymers and the related chiral monomer
were measured, and the results are listed in Table 3. The [α]D20 values
of these polyamides are not fixed but vary within a certain range.
The [α]D20 magnitudes of PAnLATs decrease in the order of PA10LAT (−17.9 to −20.0°),
PA12LAT (−15.2 to −16.0°), PA9LAT (−13.3
to −15.9°), and PA11LAT (−11.8 to −13.6°).

Table 3 Specific Optical Rotation of PAnLATs

PA9LAT	–13.3 to −15.9	
PA10LAT	–17.9 to −20.0	
PA11LAT	–11.8 to −13.6	
PA12LAT	–15.2 to −16.0	
All of these four polyamides express a negative value
of [α]D20, which are consistent with the
corresponding
monomer l-ATA ([α]D20 = −21.0°).
However, the magnitudes of the [α]D20 are
not associated strictly with the density of the chiral carbon atom
in the backbone. Essentially, the specific optical rotation for a
chiral species is a composite of the response of the multiple conformations.18 The linear aliphatic polyamides containing flexible
methylene segments display varying conformations in the dilute solution,
which influences the asymmetry of the macromolecules. The specific
optical rotation of the odd–even polyamides, PA9LAT and PA11LAT,
are weaker than that of the even–even polyamides, PA10LAT and
PA12LAT.

To make a further investigation of the reason for the
optical activity
of the polymers and the influences of the number of methylene groups
in the diamine segment, UV–CD spectra of the polyamides were
researched and compared with the corresponding optical activity of
the monomer. Figure 3a shows that the polyamides display the same negative Cotton effect
at about 210 nm, and the intensities are −13.1 mdeg for PA11LAT,
−10.8 mdeg for PA12LAT, −8.5 mdeg for PA9LAT, and −7.3
mdeg for PA10LAT. On the other hand, these CD curves exhibit a reversal
at around 200 nm, and the strength of the reversal of PA10LAT is the
strongest, PA9LAT the second, PA12LAT the third, and PA11LAT the least
(Figure 3a). In addition,
the CD intensities of the polymers are less strong than the corresponding
monomer (−20 mdeg at 215 nm), but l-ATA does not show
any such reversal tail (Figure 2).

Figure 2 CD signals of l-ATA characterized in HFIP (c = 2.08 × 10–6 mol/mL) and in the solid state.

To clarify the relationship of
the optical activity and the number
of methylene groups in the diamine segment for PAnLATs, we constructed the tendency chart of the magnitudes of CD signals
at the specific wavelength (Figure 3b,c). Figure 3b shows that the ellipticities of PAnLATs at 210 nm increase in a zigzag pattern with the number
of methylene groups in the diamine segment, and Figure 3c suggests that the reversal intensity from
210 to 200 nm decreases in a zigzag pattern with the number of methylene
groups.

the repeating unit) at 20 °C (a). Relationship of the ellipticities
of PAnLATs at 210 nm and the number of methylene
groups in the diamine segment (n) (b). Relationship
of n and the reversal strength from 210 to 200 nm
(c).

In short, these PAnLATs display different optical
activities related to the odd–even effect of the methylene
unit in the diamine segment, which was conformed both by CD signals
and their specific optical rotations. In fact, the flexible linear
backbones tend to be less ordered in a dilute solution, which leads
to intramolecular compensation of asymmetry and take responsibility
for the less intense Cotton effect of polymers compared to that of
the monomer.19 As a result, the optical
activity of the polyamides is influenced by both intrinsic chirality
of the tartrate units and the conformations of the main chain in solution.

In this work, the CD spectra of these PAnLATs
in the solid state were investigated. To facilitate the research of
PAnLATs in different states, the thicknesses of the
PAnLAT films were adjusted to achieve equal UV-abs,
which is similar to those in solution, when the UV–CD spectra
were measured in the solid phase. Figure 4a shows that the CD signals of PAnLATs in the solid film state display clear splits, with
the first positive Cotton effect presenting at 221 nm and then the
specific reversals at around 205 nm and the second reversal at about
185 nm, whereas a weak reversal around 200 nm was observed in solution.
Therefore, the CD images of PAnLATs in the solid
state vary clearly from those in the dilute solution, and the CD signals
of PAnLATs in the solid phase are higher than those
in solution when the similar UV absorption was measured. However,
the chiral monomer, l-ATA, displays similar CD images both
in solution and in the solid state (Figure 2). On the other hand, the polyamides in the
solid phase exhibit an odd–even effect in the strength of the
optical activity. For instance, the reversal strength from 221 to
205 nm for PA10LAT is the most intensive (34.6 mdeg), whereas PA11LAT
is the least (22.3 mdeg). In general, the intensity of the reversal
decreases in a zigzag pattern with the number of the methylene groups
(Figure 4b).

strength from 221 to 205 nm and the number of methylene groups in
the diamine segment of PAnLATs.

According to the exciton coupling theory, the split of the
CD signal
is related to the interaction between the adjacent chromophores.20 In our cases, the chiral pools in the l-ATA segment induced the neighbor amide group to a chiral chromophore.21 The weak split of the CD image in the dilute
solution is due to the less intermolecular aggregation and less ordered
conformations. The stronger CD signals and different CD images of
PAnLATs compared to those of the corresponding monomer
indicate that all of the polyamides adopt a chiral conformation in
the solid state. The enlarged optical activity in the solid state
is mainly due to the induced chiral amide groups, which display high
enantiopurity for the same twisted direction of the amide groups in
the backbone. Furthermore, PAnLATs in the solid state
display different optical activities related to the odd–even
effect of the methylene unit in the backbone, which may be resulted
from the different aggregations in the solid phase.

Crystalline
Properties of PAnLATs
The CD spectra results
indicate that PAnLATs have
specific CD images and display obvious chirality amplification in
the solid state when compared to those in solution as well as the
related chiral monomer. In addition, the optical activity of polyamides
presents an odd–even effect in the solid phase. It is reported
that the noncovalent interactions among the polymers play a crucial
role in the chiral conformation of the polymer, which is responsible
for the chirality amplification.22,23 In the case
of PAnLATs, the crystallization and the intramolecular
hydrogen bonding between C=O and N–H may aid in the
spontaneous organization of the chiral/helical architectures. We investigated
the crystallinity and the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between
C=O and N–H via XRD and FTIR spectra for the understanding
of the specific chirality of the polyamides.

Figure 5 represents XRD patterns of
PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT in the powder state. It indicates
that the polyamides are partly crystallized. The powder samples of
PA9LAT and PA11LAT possess similar XRD patterns, which reveal strong
reflection peaks at diffraction angles 2θ = 20.9 and 20.6°,
and the corresponding d-spacings are 0.42 and 0.43
nm, respectively. On the other hand, PA10LAT shows three reflection
peaks at 2θ = 17.4° (d-spacing = 0.51
nm), 2θ = 21.2° (d-spacing = 0.42 nm),
and 2θ = 11.4° (d-spacing = 0.77 nm).
PA12LAT expresses similar XRD patterns, with characteristic reflection
peaks at 2θ = 17.6° (d-spacing = 0.50
nm), 2θ = 20.9° (d-spacing = 0.42 nm),
and 2θ = 11.6° (d-spacing = 0.76 nm).
It is reported that the crystal structure of aliphatic polyamides
is greatly related to the odd–even numbers of carbon atoms
in the diamine segments and diacid segments.24 In this case, the different crystal structure of PAnLATs presents the odd–even effect to the number of carbon
atoms in the backbone. PA9LAT and PA11LAT are odd–even polyamides
whose powders appear crystalline, similar to the typical characteristics
of a γ-phase with a diffraction peak at 0.415 nm.25 In fact, the γ-form structure is always
found when hydrogen bonds cannot be well established with the extended
conformation, as seen with odd–even or even–odd nylons.26 The repulsive effects of the vicinal side pendent
ester groups would be expected to restrict the aldaric acid moiety
in an extended conformation. However, polymers can crystallize because
the chains pack together in a regular manner.27 To further study the intermolecular interaction, FTIR spectra of
PAnLATs were obtained to compare the N–H stretching
vibration at 3320 cm–1 when the ester groups at
1740 cm–1 have no detectable difference (Figure 6). Figure 6 shows that the intensity of
the absorption from N–H stretching vibration at 3320 cm–1 decreases in the order of PA10LAT, PA12LAT, PA9LAT,
and PA11LAT. Although crystal structures of PA10LAT and PA12LAT are
different from the traditional aliphatic nylons, more hydrogen bonding
among polymer chains help them aggregate in a more ordered packing.

Figure 5 XRD patterns
of the polyamides in the powder state.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT, and PA12LAT.

The results indicate that more hydrogen bonds are
formed in even–even
polyamides than those in odd–even polyamides when the polyamide
chains aggregate in the solid phase. Interestingly, the optical activity
of PAnLATs is identical to the results of FTIR and
XRD measurements, which demonstrates that the higher the crystallinity
of the polyamide, the more intense CD signals the polyamide presents.
The study of the crystalline properties and the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding between C=O and N–H of PAnLATs
suggests that the molecular chains pack stereoregularly and contribute
to form a stable chiral conformation in the solid state, which avoids
the intramolecular compensation of asymmetry and takes responsibility
for the chirality amplification.

Conclusions
A
series of PAnLATs, PA9LAT, PA10LAT, PA11LAT,
and PA12LAT, were prepared successfully via a facile method by introducing
the chiral pools into the backbone. The mild reaction conditions contribute
greatly to avoiding racemization and intramolecular compensation.
For the first time, the optical activity of these polyamides with
different numbers of methylene groups in the backbone was studied
both in a dilute solution and in the solid state. These linear aliphatic
polyamides show a similar Cotton effect, analogical CD images, and
different ellipticities in the solution and solid state. When the
crystalline polymers are packed together in a regular manner, the
main chain of the polyamide could adopt a chiral conformation, which
is responsible for the enhanced aggregation-induced CD signals. PA10LAT
and PA12LAT (even–even polyamides) exhibit a more stable crystal
structure than PA9LAT and PA11LAT (odd–even polyamides), which
is identical to the variation trend of the optical activity for the
polyamides. In brief, the higher the crystallinity of the polyamide,
the more intense optical activity the polyamide presents. PAnLATs display intensive chirality in the solid phase, which
facilitates the applications in the chiral packing materials for the
optical resolution of racemates.

Experimental Details
Materials
1,9-Nonamethylenediamine, 1,10-decamethylenediamine,
1,11-undecanediamine, and 1,12-dodecanediamine were provided commercially
by Zibo Guangtong Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). l-Tartaric
acid (99%) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc. Other chemicals
were of analytical grade or higher and were used without further purification.
Solvents to be used under anhydrous conditions were dried by standard
methods.

Characterization
GPC was carried out on Waters instruments
with a Waters 515HPLC Pump at 40 °C. Polymer solutions (1 mg/mL,
in DMF) were injected, and DMF was used as the eluent. Molecular weights
were estimated against poly(methyl methacrylate) standards. FTIR spectra
ranging from 4000 to 400 cm–1 were recorded on a
TENSOR II FTIR spectrophotometer from KBr disks. In the case of PAnLATs, 2 g of PAnLAT and KBr compounds,
in which the quantity of repeating units for PAnLAT
is 1 mmol, were blended and grinded. A quantity of 150 mg of the mixture
was taken to prepare the KBr disk under a pressure of 13 MPa for 2
min. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on
a Bruker DPX-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used
as the internal reference. Elemental analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer
2400 CHNS/O elemental analyzer at 700 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere
with a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/differential scanning calorimetry thermobalance
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. XRD measurements were carried
out at room temperature using a Rigaku XRD Ultima IV diffractometer
operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a filtered curved graphite crystal
and Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The
samples were fixed on the sample holder, and the data were collected
in a range of 2θ = 10–40° at 4°/min. The solubilities
of PAnLATs were evaluated. The solvent (1 mL) was
added to the polymers (10 mg, respectively) in vials. The vials were
allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, and the solutions
were then centrifuged before determining the solubility. Optical rotations
of the polyamides in solutions were measured on a PerkinElmer-341
automatic digital polarimeter using sodium D-line (589 nm) at 20 °C.
UV–CD absorption spectra of the polyamides in solution and
in the solid phase were recorded on a Chirascan (Applied Photophysics)
CD spectrometer. The compound in solution (c = 2.08
× 10–6 mol/mL, repeating unit for polymers)
was measured in a quartz colorimetric dish with the path length of
1 mm at 20 °C. A thin film was coated on a quartz substrate by
evaporation of the solvent, and the thickness of the film was evaluated
by UV-abs.

Synthesis of the PAnLAT
Polymers
The
reaction strategy to obtain PAnLATs is outlined in Scheme 1. l-ATA
was prepared according to the literature.28l-Tartaric acid (10 g) was stirred in 50 mL of acetic anhydride
for 2 h at 60 °C. The mixture was kept at 0 °C overnight,
and the precipitated l-2,3-di-O-acetyltartaric
anhydride was collected by filtration and washed with anhydrous ether.
The anhydride was dissolved in 30 mL of water, stirred for 30 min
at 30 °C, and then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 30
mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure
at 35 °C till silky white crystals (l-ATA) were formed.
Yield: 11.2 g (72%), mp 120 °C. 1H NMR (D2O, ppm): 2.23 (s, 6H, CH3), 5.76 (s, 2H, CH). FTIR (KBr):
3400 cm–1 (O–H carboxylic acid); 2950, 1380
cm–1 (CH3); 1740 cm–1 (C=O ester); 1070, 1220 cm–1 (C–O–C
ester). [α] D20 = −18.1° (c = 1 g/100 mL, H2O).

l-ATA (2.4
g, 0.01 mol), BTC (2.5 g, 0.0075 mol), and toluene (50 mL) were stirred
in a three-necked flask, and then DMF (2 mL) was added dropwise while
the reaction was kept in the ice-bath. Subsequently, the reaction
system was heated to 30 °C and kept for 1 h till unsoluble l-ATA transformed into l-ATC, which was soluble in
toluene. The toluene solution containing l-ATC was prepared
for the synthesis of the polyamides.

1,9-Nonamethylenediamine,
1,10-decamethylenediamine, 1,11-undecanediamine,
and 1,12-dodecanediamine were employed for the preparation of PAnLATs via interfacial polymerization. Taking PA12LAT for
example, 0.01 mol of 1,12-dodecanediamine was dissolved in 5 mL of
ethanol and then 45 mL distilled water was added slowly under stirring
at 40 °C. Triethylamine (0.02 mol) was added to the aqueous phase
as the acid acceptor. A volume of 50 mL of toluene containing 0.01
mol of l-ATC was added into the breaker slowly. Then, the
interface formed and the polymerization began immediately when adding l-ATC. A PA12LAT film formed at the liquid interface and was
collected by a glass rod. The polyamide was washed well with distilled
water and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 8 h. All of
the polymers of PAnLATs were prepared similarly.
