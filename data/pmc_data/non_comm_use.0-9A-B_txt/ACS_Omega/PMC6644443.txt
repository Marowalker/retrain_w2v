Single-chain polymer nanoparticles
(SCNPs) obtained through chain
collapse via intramolecular cross-linking are attracting significant
interest for nanomedicine and biomimetic catalysis applications, among
other fields. This interest arises from the possibility to bind active
species (e.g., drugs and catalysts)—either temporally or permanently—to
the SCNP local pockets formed upon chain collapse. However, direct
quantification of the size and number of such local domains in solution—even if highly desirable—is currently
highly demanding from an experimental point of view because of the
small size involved (<5 nm). On the basis of a scaling analysis,
we establish herein a connection between the global compaction degree
(R/R0) and the size (ξ)
and number (n) of the “collapsed domains” generated upon SCNP formation at high dilution from a linear
semiflexible precursor polymer. Results from molecular dynamics simulations
and experimental data are used to validate this scaling analysis and
to estimate the size and number of local domains in polystyrene SCNPs
synthesized through a “click” chemistry procedure, as
a representative system, as well as for relevant catalytic SCNPs containing
Cu, Pt, and Ni atoms. Remarkably, the present work is a first step
toward tuning the local domain size of the next generation of SCNPs
for nanomedicine and bioinspired catalysis applications.

1 Introduction
Intramolecular cross-linking
of individual polymer chains in a
good solvent at high dilution produces single-chain polymer nanoparticles
(SCNPs) via intrachain collapse.1−5 The compaction of a single chain to a SCNP resembles—in some
way—the conformational rearrangement needed by some biomacromolecules
to reach its functional state.6−8 Depending on the specific nature
of the intramolecular cross-links formed, dynamic or permanent SCNPs
result by involving reversible or irreversible intrachain interactions,
respectively.9,10 These soft nano-objects have
attracted significant interest for a variety of applications, including
nanomedicine and biomimetic catalysis uses.3 The possibility to bind active species (e.g., drugs and catalysts)—either
temporally or permanently—to the SCNP local pockets formed
upon intrachain chain collapse remains as a driving force toward bioinspired
applications.6,8 To understand the possibilities
that SCNPs offer for nanomedicine and biomimetic catalysis, the reader
is referred to several illustrative works11−25 and a recent book.26

Significant
theoretical effort27−32 has been recently devoted to understand how the nature of the intramolecular
cross-links (both reversible and irreversible interactions), the amount
of functional reactive groups, x, and the precursor
molecular weight, Mw, determine the global
collapse degree upon intramolecular cross-linking, R/R0, where R0 and R are the linear precursor polymer size and
the SCNP size, respectively. However, to our best knowledge, no attempt
has been yet carried out to establish a connection between the global
compaction degree (R/R0) and the size (ξ) and number (n) of local
pockets (domains) generated upon SCNP formation at high dilution.
It is worthy of mention that a direct visualization/quantification
of such local domains in solution—even if highly desirable—is
currently highly demanding from an experimental point of view.26

We use herein the analogy of chain confinement
into a spherical
cavity33 to the collapse of a linear chain
to a SCNP to perform a scaling analysis34,35 allowing to
establish a connection between the global compaction degree (R/R0) and the size (ξ)
and number (n) of “collapsed domains” generated upon SCNP formation at high dilution. It is worthy
of mention that the case of confinement of a linear semiflexible polymer
chain into a cavity under good solvent conditions has recently attracted
significant theoretical and computer simulations efforts.36−39 Remarkably, the present work provides a solid basis to understand
the effect of (i) the strength of the intramolecular interactions,
(ii) the amount of functional groups, (iii) the precursor molecular
weight, and (iv) the precursor chain stiffness on the size and number
of local domains of SCNPs in solution.

The article is organized
as follows. In Section 2, we first introduce two expressions for
the change in free energy upon collapse based, respectively, on the
analogy of SCNP formation to the case of chain confinement into a
spherical cavity under good solvent conditions and on the number of
new intramolecular bonds formed and the change in free energy per
each new bond formed. Next, useful scaling expressions for the global
compaction degree and the size and number of local domains are derived.
Validation of the scaling analysis with results from molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and reliable experimental data, as well as an estimation
of the size and number of local domains for relevant catalytic SCNPs
in solution containing Cu, Pt, and Ni atoms, is provided in Section 3 and, finally, the
conclusions of the work are given in Section 4.

2 Scaling Analysis
2.1 Free Energy of Collapse
Let us assume
that the change in free energy, ΔFc, upon collapse of a linear precursor polymer of size R0 to a SCNP of size R in a good solvent
under high dilution conditions follows an expression similar to that
corresponding to chain confinement into a spherical cavity under good
solvent conditions35−39 1  where kB is the
Boltzmann’s constant, T the absolute temperature,
and α is the scaling exponent of the resulting collapsed
domains upon SCNP formation (see below). It is reasonable
to assume that SCNPs with different chain stiffness will show different
values of the exponent in eq 1, as observed in computer simulations of semiflexible chains
confined in a spherical cavity.36

Because the free energy of collapse comes from all of the new intramolecular
bonds formed, we can additionally write 2  where xN/2 is the number
of new intramolecular bonds formed, x is the fraction
of reactive groups in the linear precursor polymer of total number
of monomers N, and |Δfc| is the absolute value of the change in free energy per each
new bond formed. Implicit in eq 2 is the assumption that by means of dimerization of the corresponding
reactive monomers the maximum number of intrachain bonds (xN/2) is obtained. Experimentally, this is expected to be
the case for SCNPs prepared through highly reactive cross-linking
procedures (e.g., “click” chemistry reactions10) but not for SCNPs prepared by means of weak,
dynamic interactions9 (e.g., hydrogen bonds).
For real systems, Δfc is expected
to contain a favorable enthalpic contribution, Δhc < 0, because of (exothermic) bond formation and an
unfavorable entropic contribution, Δsc < 0, because of severe configurational restriction upon chain
collapse.

2.2 Global Compaction Degree
By combining eqs 1 and 2, we obtain an analytical expression for the compaction degree (R/R0) as a function of x and N such as 3a   3b  

Taking into account that the size of
a semiflexible linear chain in a good solvent is given37 (to a first approximation) by R0 ≃ bC∞1/5Nν0, where b is the monomer size, C∞ is the characteristic ratio,34 and ν0 is the Flory exponent (ν0 ≈ 3/5), eq 3a can be rewritten as 4a   4b  

Consequently, according to the present scaling
analysis, the exponents
of the dependence of SCNP size R on x and N are actually connected through eq 4b.

2.3 Local
Domain Size
Similar to the
case of a linear chain confined in a spherical cavity,35−39 we introduce herein the concept of“cross-linked blobs” or collapsed domains upon SCNP formation
via chain collapse. The average number of such domains (n) each one having associated a free energy around kBT and a size ξ can be estimated
from the free energy of collapse such as37,39 5  Therefore, by using eqs 1 and 2, we obtain the
following expressions for the domain size 6a   6b  whereas the number of monomers in each collapsed
blob (g) is just given by37,39 7  

It is worthy of mention that α
in eq 6a is related to the scaling exponent
of the cross-linked blobs, so its value gives an idea of compaction
at local level (i.e., at domain size ξ). Conversely,
the value of ν in eq 4a gives an indication of chain compaction at global scale (i.e., at SCNP size R). In general, one expects
1/3 ≤ (α, ν) ≤ 1 where the lower value is
expected for globule-like compaction, whereas the upper value corresponds
to rod-like compaction.34

It is instructive
to rewrite eqs 5 and 7 by using eq 6b, such as 8  and 9  

Hence, according to the present
scaling analysis n depends linearly on x, N, and
|Δfc|, whereas g depends inversely on x and |Δfc| but it is independent on N.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Scaling Analysis Validation
with Data from
MD Simulations
Analysis of R/R0 and xN/2 data from MD simulations of
semiflexible SCNPs in terms of eq 3a allows one to determine the scaling exponent β
(and hence α from eq 3b) as well as the absolute value of the change in free energy
per each new bond formed, |Δfc|. Figure 1 shows such an analysis
for SCNPs having different chain stiffness, as characterized by the
value of the bending constant k employed in the coarse-grained
MD simulations.40 Note that k is related to the well-known characteristic ratio, C∞, and it was previously reported that C∞ ≈ 1.7, 5, 9, and 15 for k = 0 (fully flexible case), 3, 5, and 8, respectively.40 The dependences of β, the exponent of
the free energy of collapse 3/(3α – 1), and |Δfc| on chain stiffness are illustrated in Figure 2 for semiflexible
SCNPs. Upon increasing the SCNP characteristic ratio, the value of
β was found to decrease nearly linearly with C∞ (see Figure 2A). Concerning the exponent of the free energy of collapse,
it decreases abruptly on increasing C∞ toward a plateau value for the stiffer SCNPs (Figure 2B). This behavior is in agreement with that
reported by Cifra and Bleha36 in computer
simulations of the confinement of a semiflexible linear chain in a
closed spherical cavity reaching a limiting value of 2.6 upon increasing
chain stiffness. Interestingly, |Δfc| also reaches a plateau value upon increasing SCNP stiffness (Figure 2C). As noted by Cifra
and Bleha,36 for semiflexible linear chains,
the free-energy penalty on chain compaction is maximum for the fully
flexible case when compared with the case of stiffer systems. According
to the data in Figure 2C, there is a difference in |Δfc| between the fully flexible and stiffer SCNPs around 3.7 kBT. An estimation of the free
energy of collapse as a function of SCNP stiffness at identical compaction
degree can be obtained from eq 1. As an example, at a compaction degree R/R0 = 0.65, we obtain  =
218.0, 14.8, 7.1, and 4.4 for SCNPs with C∞ = 1.7, 5, 9, and 15, respectively.

Table 1 shows
a
comparison of the values of ν = ν0 + β
and , as derived from the present scaling
analysis,
to those previously reported for semiflexible SCNPs with different C∞ values as estimated directly from MD
simulations data.40 As stated previously
in Section 2, ν
gives an indication of chain compaction at global scale (i.e., at SCNP size R) whereas the value
of α is indicative of chain compaction at local level (i.e., at domain size ξ). In general, a good agreement
is observed between the values of ν from the present scaling
analysis and MD simulations. Concerning the values of α, the
MD simulations provide values that are systematically larger than
those derived from the scaling analysis, although both data sets follow
the general trend of a higher value of α on increasing C∞.

Figure 3 shows the
evolution of the collapsed domain size, ξ (in σ units,
where σ is the bead size) and the number of beads in a domain, g, as a function of SCNP stiffness, for SCNPs with a fraction
of reacting monomers of x = 0.2 and N = 400, as calculated from eqs 4a–5 with data from Figure 1 and Table 1. Inspection of Figure 3 reveals that a minimum SCNP stiffness is
required for the scaling analysis to provide consistent values of
ξ and g. As a matter of fact, the domain size
of fully flexible SCNPs in Figure 3A approaches the bead size which invalidates the scaling
analysis for this case. Inasmuch C∞ ≥ 5, consistent values of ξ, n, and g are obtained showing a collapsed domain size around 3.7σ,
about 33 collapsed blobs per SCNP and ∼12 beads per blob for
semiflexible SCNPs (x = 0.2, N =
400) with C∞ = 5, 9, and 15 because
of the similar values of |Δfc| (refer
to eqs 6bb, 8, and 9).

domain size, ξ (in σ units,
where σ is the bead size) and (B) number of beads per collapsed
domain, g, on chain stiffness for semiflexible SCNPs
(x = 0.2, N = 400) as calculated
from eqs 6bb and 9 with data from Figure 1 and Table 1.

Figure 4 illustrates
the dependence of ξ and g on the fraction of
reacting monomers, x, for SCNPs with N = 400 and C∞ = 9. Chain collapse
from a linear precursor with low amount of reacting monomers (e.g., x = 0.05) produces a few collapsed domains (∼8) of
relatively large size (∼8.4σ) containing a large amount
of beads per blob (∼51). Upon increasing x, both collapsed domain size and number of beads per blob reduce
notably (refer to eqs 6bb and 9), whereas the number of blobs is found
to increase linearly with x (refer to eq 8).

ξ, and (B) number
of beads in a collapsed domain, g, on the fraction
of reacting monomers x for SCNPs with N = 400 and C∞ = 9, as calculated

3.2 Scaling
Analysis Validation with Experimental
Data
Complementary to the analysis based on MD simulations
data, we have also analyzed data for real SCNPs in terms of eq 3a. In this sense, compaction
data from well-defined polystyrene (PS)-SCNPs synthesized via “click”
chemistry,41 covering from x = 0.025 to x = 0.3 and three different values of
weight-average molecular weight (Mw ≈
44, 111, and 232 kDa) were found to merge into a single master curve
with β ≈ −0.20 and |Δfc| ≈ 0.16, when plotted according to eq 3a (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Compaction degree (R/R0) as a function of new intramolecular bonds
formed (xN/2) for PS-SCNPs (C∞ ≈
9.5 for PS34) of different molecular weight:41Mw = 44 kDa (solid
blue points), Mw = 111 kDa (solid red
points), and Mw = 232 kDa (solid green
points).

Apparently, the experimental data
best follow the scaling behavior
at large values of N. From ν = ν0 + β and , we obtain
ν = 0.4 and α =
0.53 based on the value of β ≈ −0.20. Note that
the values of β and ν for PS-SCNPs (C∞ ≈ 9.5 for PS34) are in excellent agreement with those predicted by a model of elastic
SCNPs recently developed by our group27 (β = −1/5, ν = 2/5).

When compared with
MD simulations of SCNPs prepared from a precursor
polymer of C∞ = 9, the value of
|Δfc| was found to be about fivefold
lower for real PS-SCNPs. However, it is worth stressing that similar
values should not be expected even at a qualitative level. Thus, though
one finds similar scaling properties for the molecular size and may
expect similar entropy loss per monomer because of network formation
in the coarse-grained and in the real SCNPs, this is not the case
for the associated enthalpy change, Δhc, because the bonded and nonbonded interactions in the simplified
bead-spring model of the simulations40 are
of different nature than that in the real polymers.10

Figure 6 illustrates
the dependence of ξ and g on the fraction of
reacting monomers, x, for PS-SCNPs of Mw ≈ 44, 111, and 232 kDa, as calculated form eqs 6bb and 9 with data from Figure 5. On increasing the amount of functional monomers from x = 0.1 to x = 0.3, a decrease in the domain
size is observed from ξ ≈ 4 nm to ξ ≈ 2
nm. According to the results displayed in Figure 6A, the domain size in PS-SCNPs shows a weak
dependence on Mw. Remarkably, on the basis
of the present scaling analysis, the number of monomers in each local
domain is expected to be independent of Mw, as illustrated in Figure 6B. By taking into account that for real systems σ ≈
0.64 nm and each bead in the MD simulations comprises ∼5 monomers,
the results shown in Figure 6 are in good agreement with those displayed in Figure 4.

Figure 6 Dependence of (A) collapsed
domain size, ξ, and (B) number
of monomers in a collapsed domain, g, on the fraction
of reacting monomers, x, for PS-SCNPs (C∞≈ 9.5 for PS34) of Mw = 44 kDa (solid blue points), Mw = 111 kDa (solid red points) and Mw = 232 kDa (solid green points) as calculated from eqs 6bb and 9 with data from Figure 5.

3.3 Estimation
of Local Domain Size in Pt-, Cu-
and Ni-Containing Catalytic SCNPs in Solution
Data about
the local domain size, number of domains, and number of monomers per
domain for relevant metal-containing catalytic SCNPs20,22,42 in solution are given in Table 2. The precursor polymers
were based on either PS or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), both
having a similar value of chain stiffness34 (C∞(PS) = 9.5, C∞(PMMA) = 9.0). Estimations were carried out based
on experimental R/R0 data
by assuming α ≈ 0.53 in eq 6aa, for PtII-, CuII-, and NiII-containing SCNPs employed with success in amination of allyl
alcohol,20 selective alkyne homo-coupling
reactions,22 and photoreduction of carbon
dioxide,42 respectively.

NiII@PMMA SCNPs	photoreduction of carbon dioxide	4.2	3.7	3.0	1.9	241	(42)	
As stated previously, direct
quantification of the size and number
of SCNP local domains in solution is currently highly
demanding from an experimental point of view, so there are no experimental
data available. Nevertheless, experimental evidence of the presence
of local compact domains in isolated SCNPs is provided
in Figure 7, as revealed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements performed to
Cu-containing SCNPs upon solvent removal and deposition onto a carbon
grid.22 Obviously, upon solvent removal
the dimensions of the SCNPs change and often a pancake morphology
is observed for isolated SCNPs deposited onto solid substrates. Moreover,
the SCNP size is found to depend to a large extent on the surface
energy of the substrate.27

presence of local compact domains in a Cu-containing
SCNP in the dry state.22

4 Conclusions
Quantification
of the size and number of local domains of SCNPs
in solution is currently of great interest because of the possibilities
that offer such local pockets to bind—either temporally or
permanently—active species to them (e.g., drugs and catalysts)
rendering the resulting SCNPs highly attractive for applications in
nanomedicine and catalysis, among other fields. A scaling analysis
was performed to establish a connection between the global compaction
degree (R/R0) and the
size (ξ) and number (n) of collapsed domains
generated upon SCNP formation at high dilution from a linear semiflexible
precursor polymer. The scaling analysis was validated with results
from MD simulations and reliable experimental data. On the basis of
the scaling equations here proposed, we have estimated—as an
example of application—the size and number of local domains
for relevant catalytic SCNPs in solution containing Cu, Pt, and Ni
atoms. Remarkably, this work is a first step toward tuning the local
domain size of the next generation of SCNPs for nanomedicine and bioinspired
catalysis applications.
