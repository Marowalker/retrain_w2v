A liquid matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (liquid MALDI)
method has been developed for high-throughput atmospheric pressure
(AP) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the molecular content of crude
bioliquids for disease diagnostics. The presented method is rapid
and highly robust, enabling its application in environments where
speed and low-cost high-throughput analyses are required. Importantly,
because of the creation of multiply charged analyte ions, it provides
additional functionalities that conventional solid MALDI MS profiling
is lacking, including the use of high-performance mass analyzers with
limited m/z range. The concomitant
superior MS/MS performance that is achieved similar to ESI MS/MS adds
greater analytical power and specificity to MALDI MS profiling while
retaining the advantages of a fast laser-based analysis system and
off-line large-scale sample preparation. The potential of this MALDI
MS profiling method is demonstrated on the detection of dairy cow
mastitis, which is a substantial economic burden on the dairy industry
with losses of hundreds of dollars per diseased cow per year, equating
to a total annual loss of billions of dollars, as well as leading
to the use of large quantities of antibiotics, adding to the proliferation
of antimicrobial resistance. Only small amounts of aliquots obtained
from the daily farm milking process were prepared for liquid MALDI
MS profiling using a simple one-pot/two-step analyte extraction. Automated
analysis was performed using a custom-built AP-MALDI ion source, enabling
the simultaneous detection of lipids, peptides, and proteins. Diagnostic,
multiply charged, proteinaceous ions were easily sequenced and identified
by MS/MS experiments. Samples were classified according to mastitis
status using multivariate analysis, achieving 98.5% accuracy (100%
specificity) determined by “leave 20% out” cross-validation.
The methodology is generally applicable to AP-MALDI MS profiling on
most commercial high-resolution mass spectrometers, with the potential
for expansion into hospitals for rapid assessment of human and other
biofluids.

==== Body
Introduction
Conventional (solid)
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) profiling has been applied in many areas
of disease analysis with varying success. In general, blood analysis
by MALDI MS profiling (and its various incarnations such as SELDI1) has had limited success because of many reasons,
including the limited analytical power of the typically used axial
time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers with respect to MS/MS analysis
and the mass resolution and accuracy that is ultimately achievable.
However, MALDI MS profiling in clinical microbiology is one of the
success stories of MALDI,2 although the
same limitations with regard to ionization and instrumentation remain.

Recently, liquid atmospheric pressure (AP)-MALDI MS was introduced
as an alternative to conventional solid MALDI with many of the key
advantages of electrospray ionization (ESI) such as the generation
of multiply charged ions and thus the option to use high-performance
(hybrid) mass analyzers such as QTOFs and Orbitraps that require analyte
ions with low m/z values.3 While conventional MALDI predominately produces
singly charged ions, liquid MALDI produces “ESI-like”
multiply charged ions, resulting in low m/z values. In addition, multiply charged ions typically lead
to superior fragmentation in collision-induced dissociation (CID)-based
MS/MS (cf. peptide sequencing) and are a requirement for electron-mediated
MS/MS analysis.4,5 Ultraviolet photodissociation
improves the fragmentation of singly charged protein ions, but the
technology has limited availability on commercial instrumentation,
and the requirement of high m/z mass
analyzers remains for singly charged protein ions.4 Advantageously, liquid MALDI also benefits from virtually
all of the advantages of solid MALDI, such as high tolerance toward
sample additives/contaminants, post-analysis sample recovery and storage,
and all of the advantages of a laser-based method, such as speed and
a tightly controllable desorption event, while adding additional key
features such as greater sample homogeneity, greater ion beam stability,
and lower sample consumption.6

The
combination of all of these additional features and the well-known
strengths of conventional MALDI makes liquid MALDI a prime candidate
for the development of a powerful MS profiling method that can now
add the advances made in modern ESI MS to the speed, robustness, and
easiness of MALDI MS analysis. Following this rationale, the recently
introduced liquid AP-MALDI MS profiling methodology3 was adapted for the analysis of crude bioliquids. As a
proof-of-concept application, milk directly obtained from daily farm
milking was analyzed for the accurate detection of mastitis.

Mastitis, an infection of the mammary gland, is one of the most
prevalent diseases in dairy cattle and a significant cause of economic
loss in the dairy industry; yet, early diagnosis is still a considerable
challenge.7−9 The molecular composition of milk is subject to variation
with the animal’s health.10,11 Milk is thus
of interest as a source of information for disease diagnosis that
is collected daily and an alternative to other body fluids such as
blood, saliva, and urine, which are more intrusive or difficult to
collect routinely on a farm.

Current milk analysis methods,
such as the California mastitis
test (CMT),12 produce results largely open
to interpretation by the operator and have debatable sensitivity and
specificity, while rigorous bacteriological assessments take days
to perform.13−16 Flow cytometry is routinely used to measure somatic cell concentration
in milk samples, which is often increased in response to mastitis,
but somatic cell count is determined by numerous factors in addition
to immune response to infection.17

Validated milk molecular biomarkers for diagnosing mastitis have
yet to be described,9 but several candidates
have been proposed.18−23 Once validated molecular biomarkers are available, targeted assays
for their specific detection and quantitation, such as immunoassays,
are typically developed. Disappointingly, these classical diagnostic
tests often reach their limits with respect to marker specificity
and multiplexing, to name but a few.

An alternative approach
is MS profiling using well-defined classification
models from multivariate analysis, exploiting the richness of the
samples’ biomolecular profiles detected by high-resolution
MS. Multivariate analysis has been used to great effect utilizing
MS profiles produced with electrosurgical tools (e.g., “iKnife”)
and laser desorption probes to rapidly distinguish between healthy
and malignant tissue.24,25 However, these techniques have
focused on analyzing small, abundant molecules such as phospholipids,
limiting access to biomarkers that may exist as proteinaceous molecules.24,25 Results are typically determined by computational modeling, which
reduces the potential of operator-related bias and produces a recorded,
reviewable raw data trail. Similarly, MS profiling has been introduced
to clinical microbiology with great success, reducing the time to
diagnosis by many hours (and often days) with high identification
accuracy.26 The latter application of MS
profiling is achieved using MALDI in its conventional form and implementation,
that is, preparing solid-state MALDI samples that are analyzed in
an axial TOF instrument under high vacuum. Unfortunately, classical
MALDI MS analysis is limited with respect to sample homogeneity and
thus ion beam stability (cf. hunting for the so-called “sweet
spot”), speed of sample preparation, introduction, and analysis
as well as subsequent identification/verification of the main diagnostic
contributors in the recorded MS profile (i.e., poor structurally informative
MS/MS performance).

Here, we present a method for rapidly analyzing
and classifying
milk samples by AP-MALDI MS using 100% liquid MALDI samples and their
associated advantages. The potential of “on-the-fly”
MS/MS analysis of multiply charged analyte ions for greater analytical
specificity, as well as the use of modern bioanalytics developed for
clinical applications, significantly adds to the power of this MS
method and is demonstrated in this study.

Results and Discussion
Raw milk samples were collected from individual cows at the Centre
for Dairy Research at the University of Reading, UK, and prepared
for liquid MALDI MS analysis by a one-pot/two-step extraction, taking
less than 5 min. Samples were taken from individual udder quarters
of 109 cows for a total of 135 samples, with some cows being sampled
on multiple dates. Representative mass spectra of the milk extracts
from a cow from each of the two investigated classes (mastitis and
healthy—see the Experimental Section for further details) are shown in Figure S1. Phospholipids were abundant in the m/z range of 600–1000. In addition, many multiply charged ions
attributable to peptides were detected in this m/z range and beyond, with high abundance in the mastitis
samples (Figure S2). Deconvolution of the
spectra suggests that multiply charged ions above m/z 600 are attributable to proteins (e.g., β-casein)
or larger protein fragments (Table 1, Figure 1).

Figure 1 Examples of deconvoluted mass spectra (a,c) obtained from spectra
showing multiply charged ion species detected from representative
“healthy” and “mastitis” milk samples
(b,d). Molecules as large as β-casein were detected as multiply
charged ions. Lower mass components with strong ion signal intensities
are also evident in the deconvoluted mastitis spectra, indicating
protein degradation. Some diagnostic ions and their charge states
are indicated in the raw mass spectra assigned by deconvoluted mass
and CID MS/MS experiments discussed later in this article. Absolute
detector ion counts for 100% signal intensity can be found in the
top right corner of the nondeconvoluted mass spectra (b,d).

For sample classification, a multivariate model featuring 10 principal
component analysis (PCA) dimensions and 1 linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) dimension was constructed from a pool of 73 “healthy”
and 62 “mastitis” TOF MS profiles acquired in an automated
sequence from randomly spotted MALDI samples (example chromatogram
in Figure S3). Analysis was performed with
the Abstract Model Builder (AMX [Beta] version 1.0.1563.0) software
developed by Waters. The projection of the first two PCA dimensions
is shown in Figure 2a, with the second dimension offering visual distinction between
the two classes. The loading plot is displayed in Figure 2b, which shows a multitude
of phospholipid, peptide, and protein ions as being influential on
the second dimension. The LDA mass loading plot (Figure 2c) shows the influence of ions
in the classification model. The model’s classification performance
was assessed by the built-in “leave 20% out” cross-validation
method of AMX. From this cross-validation, a sensitivity of 90% (56/62
mastitis spectra) and a specificity of 100% (73/73 healthy spectra)
are obtained with a total classification accuracy of 95.56%, demonstrating
the potential for this method as a routine test. Importantly, no false
positives were reported.

and

In principle, the detected proteinaceous diagnostic ions
are of
interest as milk composition changes can often be attributed to disease-related
action of endogenous (and/or exogenous) enzymes. While current MALDI
MS profiling methods fall short of providing enhanced capabilities
in identifying diagnostic peptides or proteins because of poor MS/MS
performance, the predominant production of multiply charged precursor
ions in liquid AP-MALDI MS profiles now enables the employment of
“ESI-like” MS/MS sequencing, using high-performance
MS/MS instruments with a small m/z range such as hybrid Orbitrap and QTOF mass spectrometers. Thus,
to provide molecular structural information, some multiply charged
ions were selected for AP-MALDI CID MS/MS using the same liquid MALDI
sample from which the MS profile was acquired. This “top-down”
approach required no further sample preparation. Generally, MS/MS
spectra were acquired in less than 5 min (dependent on precursor ion
intensity) and typically provide greater diagnostic information if
acquired from multiply charged ions compared to singly charged ions.3,27

The presence of the precursor ion at approx. m/z 869 (Figure 3a) contributed strongly to the classification of samples
as “mastitis”, whereas the ion at approx. m/z 729 (Figure 3b) was not strongly influential for either class. The
identity of the ion at m/z 869 can
be assigned to the amino acid sequence R1-V37 of α-s1-casein (Uniprot P02662), an abundant
milk protein. This peptide has been reported by other studies but
has not been attributed to the action of a known endogenous (or exogenous)
enzyme.20,28,29 The identity
of this unknown enzyme could be important for targeted mastitis detection.
The second ion at m/z 729 can be
derived from the proteolysis of α-s1-casein by cathepsin
B or D, producing a peptide composed of amino acids R1-F24.29 However, because this peptide
does not strongly influence the mastitis classification, the action
of cathepsins B and D is less likely to be related to mastitis infection.
Both peptides contain the sequence of a known antimicrobial peptide
(isracidin, α-s1-casein amino acids 1–23).30

5H]5+ (approx. m/z 869)
and (b) MS/MS spectrum of the diagnostically less important [M + 4H]4+ (approx. m/z 729); both
spectra are annotated to indicate y, b, and immonium ions. The proposed
sequences are displayed above the spectrum and indicate N-terminal
fragments (R1-V37 and R1-F24, respectively) derived from α-s1-casein (P02662).

Furthermore, plasmin-related activity
is suggested to result in
two β-casein-derived peptides identified in Figure S4, the smaller of which was detected exclusively in
the mastitis samples and contributed strongly to their classification
as such. Increased enzymatic activity, such as plasmin proteolysis,
has long been implicated as a factor in mastitis diagnosis.31

Using this information, a targeted PCA/LDA
model was built from
the same data as the original model over a narrow m/z range (m/z 720–m/z 740) that includes three peptide ions
at approximately m/z 724, m/z 728, and m/z 736 (see Table 1). This resulted in an increase in classification accuracy
to 98.52% when assessed by “leave 20% out” cross-validation,
while maintaining a specificity of 100%. Only two mastitis samples
were misclassified. Interestingly, milking record data showed that
these two samples were collected after an initial mastitis treatment
with antibiotics 1 week prior to sampling for the present study. It
is possible that these animals were recovering and thus expressed
the markers of mastitis more weakly.

Conclusions
Besides
the method’s high classification accuracy, the generation
of “ESI-like” multiply charged precursor ions facilitates
the MS/MS identification and characterization of diagnostically important
profile ions beyond what is currently possible with MALDI MS profiling
methods. Consequently, the improved MALDI MS/MS capabilities of the
presented method enables the collection of further information about
the underlying disease biology and for the potential development of
well-defined targeted assays. However, there is also great potential
for multiplexing in disease detection using liquid AP-MALDI MS profiling
because of the acquisition of an intrinsically rich biomolecular profile,
thus providing a more comprehensive health check from a single sample
analysis. Importantly, the method is easily automated and capable
of large-scale analyses as needed for high-throughput testing of millions
of milk samples, which is the current yearly level of milk testing
in the UK’s dairy industry alone (https://www.nmr.co.uk/). We anticipate
that planned automation and ion source improvements will further decrease
analysis time and that additional diagnostic applications for other
crude bioliquids will be reported in the future. This could include
the assessment of human milk samples for mastitis in hospitals, where
MS is already used in many areas, from screening newborn babies for
disorders to clinical microbiology where conventional solid MALDI
MS has already shown its diagnostic advantages.

Experimental Section
Materials
Water, acetonitrile (MeCN), isopropanol (IPA),
and trifluoroacetic acid (all HPLC-grade) were bought from Fisher
Scientific (Loughborough, UK). Sodium iodide solution was purchased
from Waters (Manchester, UK). All other matrix components, reagents,
calibrants, and analytical standards were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich
(Gillingham, UK).

Cow Milk Samples
Raw milk samples
were collected from
individual cows from February 2016 to December 2017 at the Centre
for Dairy Research, a facility at the University of Reading (https://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/research-and-facilities/cedar.aspx). Samples were taken from one udder quarter per cow on a given day.
Cows were assessed at each milking (twice daily) by fore-milking each
udder teat prior to attachment of the milking apparatus. If clots
were present from a quarter, the cow was determined to have clinical
mastitis and milk was collected from the affected teat. Mastitis samples
were immediately obtained from the affected udder quarter by hand-milking
and frozen at −80 °C. Milk samples for analysis ranged
in appearance from obvious clinical infections (yellowed, clotted)
to indistinguishable from healthy samples to the untrained eye. Subsequent
confirmation of infection was obtained by physical symptoms (body
temperature and/or mammary swelling) and analysis of milk for somatic
cell count or culture to identify the infecting microorganism. Bacterial
culture and assessment by MALDI-TOF MS profiling were performed by
Quality Milk Management Services Ltd. (QMMS, Easton, UK).

Analyte Extraction
Aqueous trichloroacetic acid solution
(250 μL, 5% m/v) was added to raw milk samples (50 μL)
and briefly vortexed. Following room-temperature centrifugation at
13 000 rpm for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the
precipitate was resolubilized in sodium hydroxide (200 μL, 0.5
mM in 1:1 H2O/IPA) with ultrasonic assistance. This simple
extraction removed a significant amount of lactose and related polysaccharides,
which otherwise dominate the mass spectrum. These are evident in other
published work featuring only a water/methanol dilution.32

Liquid MALDI Sample Preparation
The liquid support
matrix (LSM) consisted of 2,5-DHB solution (25 mg/mL, 3:7 H2O/MeCN) with ethylene glycol added equal to 60% of the solution volume.
This modification to our usual glycerol-based LSM stemmed from recent
work optimizing ion signal through substitution of glycerol with other
diols.33

Per sample, LSM (750 nL)
was deposited onto a Waters stainless steel MALDI target. Analyte
solution (750 nL) was subsequently added to the LSM droplets. Typical
droplet shape was that of a dome and was considered optimal for robust
ion signal. Samples were analyzed immediately after spotting without
any additional drying time.

AP-MALDI MS Data Acquisition
MS
analysis was performed
with a Synapt G2-Si HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Wilmslow,
UK) equipped with an in-house developed AP-MALDI source, featuring
a Waters Research Enabled Software (WREnS)-controlled XY-stage (Zaber
Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada). This setup is capable of generating
multiply charged ions and has been detailed previously.34 In brief, an MNL100 nitrogen laser (LTB Lasertechnik
Berlin, Berlin, Germany) with a wavelength of 337 nm, a maximum pulse
repetition rate of 30 Hz, and a pulse width of approximately 3 ns
was attenuated by a neutral density filter to 20–30 μJ/pulse
for AP-MALDI MS measurements. A stainless-steel ion transfer tube
(60 mm length, 1 mm internal diameter) was added as the first ion
extracting element to the ion block with a gap of approximately 3
mm between the MALDI target plate and inlet of the ion transfer tube.
Approximately 26 W was delivered by a low-voltage DC power supply
to a wire (approx. 6 Ω resistance) surrounding the transfer
tube, providing heating. In contrast to other experiments conducted
with this source, no counter-flow N2 gas was supplied to
aid desolvation as it was observed to increase alkali metal adduct
formation for the highly charged ions. This resulted in an internal
transfer tube temperature of approx. 100 °C.34 MALDI target voltage was set to 3–4 kV and the cone
voltage to 30–40 V. The instrument was operated in ion mobility-TOF
mode, enabling ion mobility measurements to be recorded alongside m/z.

With the 337 nm laser firing
at 30 Hz, data were acquired for 60 s per sample droplet at a rate
of 1 TOF scan per second. The mass spectrometer was calibrated over
the m/z range 100–2000 with
a mixture of polyethylene glycol (0.1 mg/mL; Mw 200, 600, and 2000) or sodium iodide (2 μg/μL
in 50% IPA). Lock mass correction was applied using the peak of PC
(16:0/18:1) (m/z 760.5851), an abundant
phosphatidylcholine in bovine milk. CID MS/MS experiments were performed
for up to 5 min to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio for product
ions, with a collision potential of between 20 and 50 V as required.
The collision gas was argon and fragmentation was performed in the
“transfer” cell (after ion mobility analysis), allowing
product ion selection based on drift time and improving the MS/MS
signal-to-noise ratio.

Open laser beam experiments were only
carried out, and high-voltage
interlocks were defeated, after consultation with H&S staff at
the University of Reading, and in accordance with the site-specific
health and safety regulations.

Data Analysis
For spectral deconvolution, UniDec (version
1.0.10, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)35 was used with the following parameters: m/z range, 600–2000; subtract curved, 1; Gaussian smoothing,
0; bin, 1.0; charge range, 1–50; mass range, 100–30 000
Da; sample mass every 20 Da. Other parameters were unchanged from
the default.

With Abstract Model Builder [Beta] (AMX, version
1.0.1563.0, prototype software developed by Waters), the data were
automatically divided by the sample, detected by the change in TIC
on a “burn” chromatogram (see Figure S3). Mass spectral peaks were binned to a window of m/z 1 (Figure S5). Background correction and normalization were applied. This meant
that many isotopic peaks of highly charged ions were counted within
the same bin. A narrower bin size was not beneficial to the model
and required greater computation resources. The unsupervised PCA models
were constructed from the first 10 dimensions and the supervised LDA
model with 1 dimension for the m/z range of 600–2000. The targeted model was built with a narrow m/z range of 720–740. Model cross-validation
was performed using the built-in “leave 20% out” cross-validation
with “standard deviation > 5” as the outlier definition.
