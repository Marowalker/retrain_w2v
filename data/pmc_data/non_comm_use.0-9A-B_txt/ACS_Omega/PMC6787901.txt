Lithium–sulfur (Li–S)
batteries are excellent rechargeable
battery candidates which are extraordinarily promising as they exhibit
superior specific capacity and well-known energy density; they are
cost-effective and environmentally benign. Nevertheless, a few technical
issues pose a significant challenge on the path to industrial applications,
namely, capacity fade and Coulombic efficiency decay, which are inherent
in the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect during charge/discharge
cycling. Carbon materials which have excellent conductive scaffold
and flexible structure with a variety of morphologies can serve as
a remedy to this issue. Herein, with a well-designed melt-diffusion
procedure, we prepared three carbon-based sulfur-embedded cathodes
with diverse structures [graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and flake
graphite]. Sulfur loading varies between 60 and 73 wt %. Among these
three carbon/S cathodes, beyond 100 cycles, the graphene/S cathode
showed a discharge capacity of 840 mA h g–1 at 0.2
A g–1 current density and its average Coulombic
efficiency was above 99.4%, demonstrating the best cycle stability
and reversibility. While at a higher current rate, 1 A g–1, CNT/S reaches the best capacity of 518 mA h g–1 among these three cathodes, revealing excellent sulfur utilization
under high rate conditions. The X-ray photo spectroscopy shows evidence
for chemical bonding between graphene/CNTs surfaces and carbonyl,
hydroxyl, and ether groups, resulting in well-confined polysulfides
in the cathode side, which significantly restrain the movement of
soluble polysulfide in the charging process and efficiently decreases
the capacity fading of sulfur. This unique structure is a potential
explanation for the outstanding electrochemical performance.

1 Introduction
The lithium–sulfur
battery is an emerging star for next-generation
electrochemical energy storage, with superior theoretical specific
capacities of 1675 mA h g–1 and overwhelming 2600
W h kg–1 theoretical specific energy.1−3 Sulfur, which comprises the cathode material, is abundant in nature,
environment friendly, and of low cost. Despite these advantages, its
industrialization is still facing two basic obstacles. One is low
electric and ionic conductivity of both sulfur and its discharge products,
Li2Sx, which leads to poor
active material utilization and inferior reversibility. The other
obstacle is the loss of active material via dissolution of long chain
polysulfide intermediate products to the electrolyte, namely, “shuttle
effect”, in which soluble polysulfides transfer to the anode
side, where the reaction with metallic lithium ultimately yields shorter
and insulated polysulfides, resulting in capacity fading, inferior
Coulombic efficiency, and anode corrosion.4−6 In addition,
the volume expansion for complete lithiation of sulfur can be as high
as 80%, which leads to severe pulverization and delamination of the
active material from the current collector.7,8

Multiple strategies have been considered to solve these problems
of the sulfur cathode, such as (1) introduction of a conductive network
to enhance electron mobility; (2) design a suitable cathode network
to facilitate the lithium ion diffusion channel and immobilize polysulfides;
(3) establishment of an accessibly extensive and sufficient surface
area to lower the deposition of insulated Li2S2 or Li2S; (4) construction of robust and electrochemical
reactive porous structures to alleviate the volume expansion and buffer
the resulting stress. All these solutions share the same idea: rational
construction of the suitable sulfur cathode is the pivotal factor
to address the abovementioned Li–S batteries drawbacks.9,10

Carbon materials comes with an excellent conductive scaffold
and
flexible structure [such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)]
and diverse morphology, which can work efficiently as the sulfur and
polysulfide confinement cage in cathodes for the Li–S battery
system. Many recent reports on sulfur-embedded carbon cathodes exhibited
significant reduction of the shuttle effect for lithium sulfur batteries
and hence alleviate the capacity fading dramatically.11−16 Seeking promising sulfur substrates for lithium–sulfur battery
applications, researchers have investigated mesoporous carbon,17−20 CNTs,21−23 graphene or graphene oxide,24−30 mixture of CNTs31 and graphene,32−34 carbon fiber cloth,35 carbon onion.36

To further investigate the sulfur-embedded
carbon cathodes, we
prepared three cathodes with sulfur embedded in different carbon allotropes
(graphene, CNTs, and flake graphite) and compared their cycling and
high-rate performances at identical charge/discharge conditions. In
addition, we use the X-ray photoelectron to investigate the C–S
interaction mode in the three carbon/S composite cathodes. We expect
that the interaction between carbon and sulfur specifies has an important
effect on electrochemical performance of these carbon/S cathodes,
which can guide the improvement of carbon-based Li–S cathodes.

2 Results and Discussion
We fabricated carbon/S composites
using sulfur melt-diffusion,
in which Graphene, CNTs, and flake graphite host sulfur as confinements.
This procedure is described in detail in the Experimental
Section. The morphologies of graphene, CNTs, flake graphite
and their sulfur composites are examined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Figure 1 presents
the photography. From Figure 1a, the graphene sheets are corrugated and wrinkled with scrolled
edges. As a result of sulfur melt diffusion at temperature of 155
°C, the deficient pores of the graphene sheets are filled with
abundant sulfur particles and the surface and edges of graphene are
covered by an amount of agglomeration of sulfur, which is shown in Figure 1b. The same phenomena
were also found in CNT/S and graphite/S composites. Before sulfur
melt diffusion, CNTs organization are unordered and featured with
the three-dimensional network of bundles, as shown in Figure 1d. The flake graphite has layered
structures with smooth surfaces, as shown in Figure 1g. After melt diffusion, the sulfur particles
were agglomerated on the surfaces of CNTs to form CNT/S bulks (Figure 1e). While in the
graphite/S composites, many graphite layers agglomerated together
to form large bulks with sulfur covering all the surfaces of graphite
(Figure 1h). The sulfur
particle homogeneously covers the surfaces of these three carbon/S
composites, and further elemental mapping of sulfur in Figure 1c,f,i measurement confirms
it.

(g) graphite, and (h) graphite/S materials; elemental mapping of sulfur
in (c) graphene/S, (f) CNT/S, and (i) graphite/S.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of graphene, CNT, graphite,
graphene/S, CNT/S, graphite/S, and pure S materials are shown in Figure 2a. There is no distinct
peak in the XRD pattern of graphene, which indicates low crystallinity
or amorphous structure. The featured diffraction peaks of CNTs and
flake graphite are at 26.5°, which indicates the typical structure
of graphite crystals. The peak of CNTs is broader than that of flake
graphite, revealing their lower crystallinity. After sulfur melt-diffusion,
the sulfur diffraction peaks can be observed in three carbon/S composites
with decreased intensity compared to pure sulfur. In contrast to the
graphite/S composite, the featured peaks of graphite are observed
in CNT/S and graphene/S composites because of the low crystallinity
of CNTs and graphene themselves.

min–1 heating rate; (c) isotherms for N2 adsorption–desorption on graphene, CNT, and graphite materials;
(d) BJH graphene, CNT, and graphite pore-size distribution.

To investigate the sulfur weight ratio in the three
composites,
we performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). From Figure 2b, it is apparent that pure
sulfur features one-step weight loss in the temperature range 190–300
°C. At the same temperature range, the three carbon/S composites
reproduce the weight loss profile of pure sulfur, therefore, it is
reasonably attributed to the loss of sulfur. Thus, the loss in 190–300
°C is a good approximation to the sulfur weight ratio in the
composites. Based on the above assumption, the weights of sulfur in
the graphene/S, CNT/S, and graphite/S are calculated as 72.94, 59.63,
and 62.80 wt %, respectively.

The porosity of the three carbon/S
composites was employed by adsorption–desorption
isotherms with N2, as shown in Figure 2c. With relative pressure ranges from 0.8
to 1.0, all the three samples demonstrate no hysteresis loop, suggesting
that the materials have a large number of homogeneous pores.37 The distribution of the pore size can be deduced
with Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)’s adsorption
variants, as shown in Figure 2d. From the figure, we can see the pore size distribution
of graphene and CNTs spreads over a range from 2 to 11 nm, while there
is no significant pore in flake graphite. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface areas of graphene, CNT, and graphite materials are 113.3,
178.7, and 10.2 m2 g–1, respectively,
which indicates that the graphene and CNTs come with larger surface
area than flake graphite. This is because there are a lot of defects
and porous structures on the rough graphene sheet surface, which leads
to high surface areas. The porous and defective structures provide
spaces and interfaces to restrain soluble sulfur chains in cycling
and improve the interchange between the electrolyte and cathode, which
leads to high reversible capacity and fast charge transfer of lithiation/delithiation.38

The C 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of graphene,
graphene/S, CNT, CNT/S, graphite, and graphite/S are shown in Figure 3. The C 1s spectra
of pristine graphene and CNTs reveal the presence of C–O (285.7,
285.3 eV) and C=O (288.3, 287.6 eV) groups, which indicates
that graphene and CNTs were partly oxidized. After sulfur melt diffusion,
the binding energies of C=O (286.6, 286.5 eV), respectively,
in graphene/S and CNT/S composites became smaller than the pristine
graphene and CNTs. This indicates that the carbon surface-attached
carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether groups are expected to having chemical
bonds with sulfur, which can contribute to well-confined polysulfides
in the side of the cathode.24,32 In addition, the S
2p spectra in Figure 4b (graphene/S) and 4c (CNT/S) show the broad
high binding energy peak at the position around 169 eV, which strongly
supports chemical bond in play.39 However,
for graphite, either the C 1s or S 2p spectrum of graphite does not
show such characteristic, which indicates no chemical binding between
graphite and sulfur species.

Intensive electrochemical characterization was applied to estimate
the function of the three carbon/S cathodes with metallic lithium
as anodes. The long-term stability for cycling up to 100 cycles was
further investigated with 200 mA g–1 current density.
As Figure 5a presented,
all the three cathodes exhibit better cycle stability than pure sulfur.
Among three cathodes, discharge capacity of graphene/S remains to
be above 840 mA h g–1 up to 100 cycles. Moreover,
the average Coulombic efficiency of the graphene/S cathode reveals
to be above 99.4%, which demonstrates the best cycle stability and
excellent reversibility. The increasing in capacity in the first few
cycles is because of the electrode activity process. The lithium ion
gradually enters the electrode materials, so the lithiation channels
become much smoother after first few cycles resulting in increasing
capacity. Figure 5b–d
presents cycle dependence of charge/discharge performance of the three
carbon/S cathodes. The CNT/S cathode is able to deliver the high capacity
from the very beginning, while graphene/S and graphite/S capacity
peaks can only be obtained after 10–20 warm-up cycles, which
indicates that the CNT/S cathode represents fastest electrochemical
active kinetics among the tested cathodes. The rate capability, for
all of them, was estimated under a wide range of current density.
As can be seen from Figure 5e, the graphene/S cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity
at 1600 mA h g–1 at beginning few cycles at 100
mA g–1 current density. In case that current density
elevates to 200, 400, 800, and 1000 mA g–1, the
cathodes exhibited capacities of 1196, 1023, 713, and 448 mA h g–1, respectively. Furthermore, the graphene/S cathode
shows good recovery of the capacity of 945 and 798 mA g–1 as current rate drops to 200 and 100 mA g–1. It
is worth mentioning that CNT/S and graphite/S cathodes have better
capacities of 518 and 557 mA h g–1 than the graphene/S
cathode when it comes to the high current rate (1 A g–1), which can be explained by the fact that the CNTs and graphite
provide faster sulfur utilization under high rate charge/discharge
conditions. Figure 5f–h displays the charge rate dependence of charge/discharge
behaviors of the three carbon/S cathodes. There are two prominent
plateaus at the high charge rate which reveals excellent electrical
conductivity resulting in rapid charge transfer.

SEM images of the graphene/S, CNT/S, graphite/S, and pure
sulfur
cathodes before and after charge/discharge cycling are shown in Figure 6. For the SEM data,
the cells before cycling and after cycling are both 50% DOD discharged.
For the graphene/S cathode, there is a sign of film formation approximately
at the nanoscale on the cathode surface after cycling (Figure 6b), while CNT/S (Figure 6c) and graphite/S (Figure 6e) cathodes still
have plenty of porous surfaces, comparable to its stand-alone counterpart
(Figure 6d,f). All
the three carbon/S cathodes exhibited no evidence for passivation
film formation, indicating a robust structural stability of the cathode
leading to high reversible capability. The fabricated electrode achieves
outstanding rate capability, Coulombic efficiency, stability, and
sulfur utilization.

To further look into the sulfur confinement in the three carbon/C
cathodes compared with the pure sulfur cathode, Table 1 presents the EDX result of percentage change
for the graphene/S, CNT/S, graphite/S, and pure sulfur cathodes surface.
As the table shows, there is 6.38, 13.41, and 14.89 wt % loss of sulfur
for the graphene/S, CNT/S, and graphite/S cathodes after 100 cycles,
compared to 19.79 wt % loss from the pure sulfur cathode, indicating
the best sulfur confinement ability for graphene hosts than CNTs and
graphite cathodes. The increasing oxygen ratio after cycles is coming
from the electrolyte loading in the surface of the anode.

3 Conclusions
Graphene, CNTs, and flake
graphite were introduced as sulfur host/confinements
by using the sulfur melt-diffusion procedure to fabricate carbon-supported
sulfur cathodes. It makes construction of sulfur loading of 60–73
wt % possible for Li–S batteries. We prepared three sulfur-embedded
carbon cathodes (graphene, CNTs, and flake graphite) and compared
their cycling and high-rate performances at the identical experimental
setup. Among the three cathodes, the graphene/S cathode demonstrates
the best cycle stability and high reversibility at low rate charge/discharge
conditions, while the CNT/S cathode has better capacities at high
rate charge/discharge conditions. The C–S interaction was thoroughly
characterized to explain the excellent electrochemical performances
of graphene/S and CNT/S cathodes. The functional groups containing
oxygen are proved to chemically bond with sulfur, preventing the shuttle
effect of soluble polysulfide in the cycling process, and in turn
improves the cycle stability of the sulfur cathodes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Graphene/S,
CNT/S, Graphite/S
Materials
Graphene and flake graphite were bought from XFNano
Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China. CNTs were purchased from New Materials Co.
Ltd., Shenzhen, China. The electronic conductivities of graphene,
CNTs, and graphite are recorded using the SDY-5 four-point probe meter
(Guangzhou, China) with the four-electrode approach. The electronic
conductivities of graphene, CNTs, and graphite are 25, 105, and 620
S cm–1, respectively. Graphene, CNTs, and flake
graphite were blended with sulfur by a weight ratio of 1:3, which
were manually ground in an argon-protected glovebox. An Al2O3 crucible is used to hold and transfer the samples to
a furnace in an alumina tube, where the samples were heated in a flowing
argon environment at 155 °C for 10 h. When annealed to room temperature,
it results in homogeneous black powders. Finally, we used pestles
and mortars to grind the products. The obtained carbon/sulfur composites
were labeled as graphene/S, CNT/S, and graphite/S.

4.2 Materials Characterizations
Rigaku
D8A X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) was used to perform the
XRD measurements. The radiation source is Cu Kα (λ = 0.154
nm) with 2θ from 5° to 80°. We used N2 gas
in the TGA Q600 system (TA, USA) to analyze thermogravimetric properties,
starting at room temperature and ending at 600 °C. The heating
rate was set to 20 °C min–1. Isotherms were
measured by using an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) at liquid
nitrogen temperature for N2 adsorption–desorption.
We also deduced distribution of the pore size by the BJH method with
isotherms data. SEM is performed using the FEI Nova Nano 230 system
to characterize the sample morphologies. An accelerating voltage of
15 kV is used in the SEM experiment. We employed an X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (PHI-5000, USA) to implement XPS measurements with an
emission current of 10 mA. A radiation source (Al Kα) of 1486.7
eV is used. The SDY-5 four-point probe meter (Guangzhou, China) is
used to carry out four-electrode conductivity measurement for graphene,
CNT, and graphite materials.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
cathodes were fabricated by a mixture of carbon/S powders with acetylene
black (ENSACO Co. Ltd., Switzerland) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Alfa
Aesar Co. Ltd., USA) binder with ratio 5:3:2 in terms of weight. The
mixtures were stirred with ethanol into homogeneous slurry at room
temperature. Next, we coated them onto a current collector of aluminum
foil, which was then vacuum-dried at 70 °C for 24 h. Pure sulfur
follows the same steps. The sulfur areal loadings in the graphene/S,
CNT/S, and graphite/S cathode slides are 0.86, 0.70, and 0.74 mg cm–2, respectively. These cathodes were further assembled
to battery cells in the following procedures.

In a glovebox
protected by argon, the 2032 coin cells were used to assemble cathodes,
the counter electrodes—Li foil (Zhongneng Lithium Products
Co. Ltd., Tianjin, China), a cell separator—Celgard 2400 film
(Celgard Co. Ltd., USA), and the electrolyte—1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane
sulfone)imide + 1 wt % LiNO3 in 1,3-dioxilane and dimethoxyethane
(1:1 in volume) mixture together. The electrolyte from Guotai-Huarong
New Chemical Materials Co. Ltd., Zhangjiagang, China was used.

A battery testing system—LAND 2001A (Landian Corp., Wuhan,
China)—was used to perform the galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycle tests.
