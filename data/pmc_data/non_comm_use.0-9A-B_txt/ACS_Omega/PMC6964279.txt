A combination of platinum drugs with immunotherapy has
shown promising
anticancer effects, especially in the drug resistance cancer model.
Herein, a new type of immunochemotherapeutic was designed by tethering
the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist on the axial position of oxaliplatin-based
platinum(IV) prodrug. The prodrug simultaneously induced immunogenic
cell death of 4T1 cancer cells to initiate an immune response and
activate dendritic cells (DCs) to secrete proinflammatory cytokines
including interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-12, to further enhance
the adaptive immunity. The prodrug exhibited better in vivo anticancer
effects than oxaliplatin in the 4T1 allograft mouse model, a later
stage breast cancer model, which showed poor response to traditional
chemotherapy. Mechanism studies revealed that enhanced activation
of cytotoxic T cells within tumor contribute to the high in vivo anticancer
efficiency of the prodrug. Moreover, the prodrug displayed much lower
cytotoxicity to DCs compared with oxaliplatin, indicating its safety
to normal cells. These results highlight the potential of the conjugation
of TLR7 agonist with oxaliplatin-based Pt(IV) prodrug as an effective
anticancer agent to overcome the toxic side effects and drug resistance
of traditional platinum chemotherapy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Platinum drugs including
cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin
have been widely used in the clinic against many solid tumors, such
as testicular, ovarian, colorectal, and non-small-cell lung cancer.1 However, the toxic side effects and inherent
or acquired resistance limited the therapeutic effects.2,3 Efforts has been devoted in developing multifunctional platinum
drugs that target the cytotoxic pathways of platinum drugs to improve
the anticancer effects.4,5 It is generally accepted that
the formation of Pt-DNA damage is the main mechanism of action of
platinum-based drugs.1,6 However, they also induce off-target
effects on the immune system.6−8 Thus, platinum agents targeting
the immune system have been emerging as a promising strategy in drug
development. Several examples of the combination of platinum drugs
with immunotherapy have been reported and showed promising anticancer
effects, especially in drug-resistant cells.9−13

Recent studies found that oxaliplatin has an
unexpectedly unique
mode of action, dramatically different from cisplatin and carboplatin.8,14,15 For example, it has been shown
that oxaliplatin is able to cause ribosome biogenesis stress and nucleolar
stress, which might lead to its different clinical applications and
side effects profiles.14,15 Oxaliplatin is also noted to
induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which is highly associated with
the therapeutic outcomes of oxaliplatin.16 Oxaliplatin showed poor anticancer effects in colorectal cancer
patients lacking TLR4 gene, a gene responsible for the activation
of ICD.17 Thus, modulation of the immune
system will affect the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin-induced
ICD leads the exposure of calreticulin (CRT) on the cell surface,
which provides an “eat-me” signal for antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) to phagocytose the dying tumor cell to initiate the adaptive
immunity.16 Activation of dendritic cells
(DCs) is particularly important in this process since they are the
most powerful APCs and play important roles in immune response.18 Therefore, locally enhanced activation of DCs
by small molecules may elevate the levels of oxaliplatin-induced immunotherapy,
resulting in a better therapeutic outcome, especially in cancers that
are resistant to traditional chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the rational
design of platinum drugs based on the ICD effects of oxaliplatin has
not yet been investigated.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern
recognition receptors that
play an essential role in the innate immune system and serve as a
bridge linking early-stage innate responses to adaptive immunity.19,20 TLRs are expressed on many types of immune cells, including DCs
and macrophages.21 Recognition of antigens
by TLRs in DCs leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines
and elevated antigen presentation to naive T cells, and activation
of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses.21 Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a member of this receptor
class and becomes a popular target for drug discovery since it recognizes
synthetic small molecules.22,23 Small-molecule based
TLR7 agonists have been shown to activate immune cells such as DCs,
monocytes, and macrophages, resulting in elevated immunity response.
TLR7 agonists have been developed as anticancer immunotherapeutics
as single agents or in combination with chemotherapeutics that induce
ICD.24,25 Thus, TLR7 agonists will enhance the antitumor
immunity of oxaliplatin-induced ICD through the activation of DCs,
leading to improved anticancer effects.

To correlate this hypothesis,
herein, we designed a novel immunochemotherapeutic
agent (TPt) by conjugating a TLR7 agonist (SZU101) to
the axial position of an oxaliplatin-based Pt(IV) prodrug scaffold.
Pt(IV) complexes are prodrugs, which are kinetically inert and can
be activated by endogenous reductants to release the active Pt(II)
drug along with the dissociation of the axial ligands.26,27 We reasoned that this prodrug could simultaneously induce ICD by
the released oxaliplatin and promote the activation of DCs by the
released TLR7 agonist, leading to an enhanced immunochemotherapy (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Overview of the Design
of the Immunochemotherapeutic
TPt enters
cancer
cells and is reduced to release oxaliplatin and TLR7 agonist SZU101.
The former induces immunogenic cell death of cancer cells to provide
tumor antigen, the latter enhances the maturation of DCs, leading
to increased production of cytokines and activation of cytotoxic T
cells. Lastly, the activated T cells kill the remaining cancer cells.

2 Results and Discussion
An adenine type
of TLR7 agonists SZU101 (Scheme 1) was prepared following previously reported
methods.24 This small molecule SZU101 is
able to stimulate DCs with a higher level of cytokines compared with
lipopolysaccharides, a class of larger molecules that act as prototypical
endotoxins to induce an immune response. TPt was constructed
by conjugation of SZU101 to the axial position of c,t,c-[Pt(DACH)(OH)2ox],
DACH = (1R,2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane,
ox = oxalate, using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium
tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) as coupling agent in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(Scheme S1). The final product was purified
by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The
purity of TPt is 96%, as ascertained by analytical liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Figure S1). TPt was well characterized by ESI-HRMS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 195Pt NMR (Figures S2–S5). Since Pt(IV) prodrug is
believed to exert its cytotoxicity by its reduced products, we measured
the reduction process of TPt in the presence of sodium
ascorbate in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH = 7.4). As shown in Figures 1A and S6, TPt is stable in PBS buffer
with 96% TPt remained after incubation for 24 h. In the
presence of 1 mM sodium ascorbate, 43% TPt was reduced
to oxaliplatin and SZU101 after 24 h incubation, indicating the reduction
process is relatively slow. This result is consistent with other reports
that oxaliplatin-based Pt(IV) prodrugs are general not easily to be
reduced.28,29

for 24 h; (F) activation of human TLR7-NF-κB signaling by SZU101,
oxaliplatin, or TPt for 18 h.

We first evaluated the cancer cell killing effects
of TPt as well as oxaliplatin and SZU101 alone in 4T1
murine breast cancer
cell line. This cell line has been widely employed in antitumor studies,
as a model mimics stage IV human breast cancer, which shows poor response
to chemotherapy.30−33 Cells were treated with complexes for 48 h, and the cell viability
was measured by CCK 8 assay. As shown in Table 1, oxaliplatin showed moderate cytotoxicity
against 4T1 cells with an IC50 value of 7.2 ± 2.7
μM. SZU101 itself exhibited low direct cytotoxicity towards
the cell lines with IC50 values larger than 50 μM.
SZU101 is a TLR7 agonist, which kills cancer cells through activation
of immune cells, so its direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells is low. TPt demonstrated lower activity against 4T1 cells compared
with oxaliplatin with an IC50 value of 48.0 ± 1.9
μM. The lower cytotoxicity of TPt might due to
its slow reduction process within cells, which was also observed in
other reported oxaliplatin-based Pt(IV) prodrugs.34,35 A physical mixture of oxaliplatin with SZU101 (1:1 mole ratio) showed
comparable cytotoxicity with that of oxaliplatin as expected. The
cytotoxicity of these complexes against immune cells was also
investigated, a higher cell killing effect to immune cells might inhibit
the immune response. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were
used for the measurement. Notably, oxaliplatin is very toxic to BMDCs
with an IC50 value of 2.7 ± 0.2 μM. While SZU101
and TPt were less toxic with IC50 values larger
than 50 μM. These data suggest that TPt showed lower cytotoxicity to both cancer
cells and DCs.

The cytotoxicity of platinum-based anticancer drugs
is highly correlated
with cellular platinum levels. We measured the cellular uptake of TPt and oxaliplatin in 4T1 cells. 4T1 cells were treated with
10 μM platinum complexes for 6 or 12 h, and the platinum contents
in cells were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
(ICP-MS). As shown in Figure 1B, the platinum level in TPt-treated cells are
higher than that by oxaliplatin. For example, after 6 h treatment,
the values are 1.03 ± 0.52 and 0.53 ± 0.23 ng Pt per 106 cells respectively. The results indicated that ligation of
SZU101 facilitated the drug uptake, and the lower cytotoxicity of TPt towards 4T1 cells mainly resulted from its slow activation
process within cells.

The induction of ICD of cancer cells is
the first step to initiate
antitumor immunity of the designed immunochemotherapeutic. We tested
the ability of TPt to induce the ICD of 4T1 tumor cells
by measuring calreticulin (CRT) exposure. Calreticulin is a protein
that is widely distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cell
surface exposure of calreticulin determines the immunogenicity of
cancer cell death.36 We measured the CRT
exposure of 4T1 cells treated with TPt as well as oxaliplatin
and SZU101 by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with complexes for
24 h and stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-CRT antibody,
the dead cells were gated out by using Sytox Green. As shown in Figures 1C and 1D, treatment with oxaliplatin-induced CRT exposure on the
surface, which is consistent with previous reports.37 SZU101 did not induce noticeable CRT exposure. As expected, TPt also induced CRT exposure with a comparable mean value
of CRT fluorescence with that of oxaliplatin. In addition, studies
indicated the additional in vitro detection of ICD marker ATP was
also critical for the immune response.38 Chemiluminescent assay was used to assess the extracellular release
of ATP in the culture medium of 4T1 cells after 24 h treatment with TPt, oxaliplatin or SZU101 at a concentration of 100 μM.
The extracellular ATP concentration was detected to be 14 nM after
treatment with TPt, while the values are 11 and 2.8 nM
after oxaliplatin and SZU101 treatment respectively (Figure 1E). These data suggest that TPt is able to induce immunogenic cell death as its active
parent Pt(II) drugs, thereby stimulating the engulfment of dying tumor
cells-associated antigen by immature DCs.

We then tested the
agonistic activity of TPt by using
a HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cell system. Stimulation of TLR7 will activate
NF-kB, followed by the expression of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase
(SEAP), which will be detected by using HEK-blue as the substrate.
The 50% of maximal effective concentration was calculated for each
complex. As indicated in Figure 1F, SZU101 activated TLR7 with an EC50 value
of 0.93 ± 0.17 μM, while oxaliplatin itself did not stimulate
TLR7. TPt significantly activated TLR7 with an EC50 value of 0.14 ± 0.01 μM. The TLR7 stimulation
ability of TPt increased 6.6-fold compared with that
of SZU101. TLR7 is expressed on both cell surface and intracellular
endoplasmic reticulum.39 The negative charge
of SZU101 might reduce its cellular accumulation, conjugation of SZU101
with platinum improved its cellular uptake. The high concentration
of TPt within cells might contribute to its improved
agonistic activity compared with SZU101. These data suggest that TPt is a strong agonist to human TLR7, which will stimulate
DCs to generate proinflammatory cytokines.

The stimulation of
DCs by TPt was further measured.
Activation of BMDCs was confirmed via the levels of cytokines released
in the media by cytometric bead array (CBA) assay. TPt was incubated with BMDCs for 18 h, oxaliplatin and SZU101 were used
as controls. As shown in Figures 2 and S7, oxaliplatin itself
did not induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting
that oxaliplatin itself does not elicit the DCs response directly.
Treatment with SZU101 leads to the secretion of cytokines at a moderate
level. Notably, TPt effectively induced the secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines with high amplitude. TPt showed approximately 2-fold higher potencies, as assessed by IFN-γ,
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 release, compared with SZU101. In addition,
upon treatment with SZU101 or TPt, the upregulation of
antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was negligible (Figure 2E). The significantly enhanced secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines by DCs upon treatment of TPt will promote the proliferation and activity of cytolytic T cells,
resulting in an elevated antitumor immune response.

The above in vitro results prompted us to address
whether TPt induced tumor cell killing and cytokines
production activity
can efficiently inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The murine mammary adenocarcinoma
4T1 allograft models were established by subcutaneous inoculation
with 2 × 105 4T1 cells in the right flank of BALB/c
mice. 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were intratumorally injected with the
tested complexes every three days for a total administration of three
times when the tumors were palpable on day 7. As indicated in Figure 3A–C, oxaliplatin
or SZU101 alone weakly inhibited the tumor growth. However, TPt significantly inhibited tumor growth with a 55% reduction
in tumor volume and 64% reduction in tumor weight, which is significantly
more effective than oxaliplatin with a 15% reduction in tumor volume
and 26% reduction in tumor weight respectively. In addition, the body
weight of the mice treated with TPt did not change significantly
(Figure 3D), indicating
the safety of the complex. Lastly, 32 days after tumor inoculation,
mice were sacrificed and cellular infiltrates in treated tumors were
analyzed. Compared to the PBS group, TPt largely increased
the intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells. The frequency
of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the TPt-treated group was comparable with that in the SZU101 or oxaliplatin
treated group with a slightly high mean value (Figure 4A). Similar results were also found within
splenocytes (Figure 4B). The antitumor immune response elicited by TPt was
further confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 4C). We found that TPt treatment
instigated extensive CD8+ T cell infiltration within the
tumor, whereas less tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were
observed in the other groups. In addition, a large fraction of the
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-γ, indicating
the ability of TPt to promote activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration into tumors and induce antitumor
immunity. These results further confirm the anticancer efficacy of
the prodrug in vivo, and activation of T cells partially contributed
to this effect, which verified our strategy to enhance the anticancer
effects of oxaliplatin by stimulation of DCs followed by activation
of T cells. Despite the prodrug showed low direct cytotoxicity to
4T1 cells as indicated by the in vitro assay, the prodrug significantly
inhibited in vivo tumor growth compared with oxaliplatin, which highlights
the advantages of activation of the immune system to kill cancer cells.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report the
first example of an oxaliplatin-based
Pt(IV) prodrug bearing TLR7 agonist as an immunochemotherapeutic agent
against breast cancer. The prodrug induced ICD of cancer cells compared
with the parent oxaliplatin. Remarkably, the prodrug significantly
activated TLR7 and simulated BMDCs to secrete proinflammatory cytokines,
including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 to further activate
cytotoxic T cells to kill cancer cells. A combination of these effects
leads to enhanced in vivo antitumor effects of the prodrug against
stage IV breast cancer model compared with that of oxaliplatin. In
addition, the prodrug showed very lower cytotoxicity to BMDCs compared
with oxaliplatin. These results suggest that the prodrug hold great
promise to overcome the systemic side effects and drug resistance
issues of traditional platinum chemotherapy. We believe this strategy
will shed light on the design of Pt-based immune-therapeutics with
improved antitumor efficacy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Methods
Oxaliplatin was obtained
from Boyuan Technology (Shandong, China). All the reagents and solvents
were bought from commercial suppliers and used as received without
further purification. NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Ascend
AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts
per million relative to residual solvent peaks. ESI-HRMS were conducted
on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL. LC-MS analysis was performed
on an Agilent Infinitylab LC/MSD 1260 system, equipped with a reversed-phase
C18 column (YMC 100 × 2.10 mm, 2 μm). The samples were
monitored by UV absorbance at 254 and 370 nm and ESI-MS at scan mode.
Solvent A (H2O with 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% HCOOH) and
solvent B (acetonitrile with 5% H2O and 0.1% HCOOH) were
used for a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The samples
were eluted by using a program as follows: 0% B (0 min) → 20%
B (3 min) → 100% B (6 min) → 100% B (12 min). For measurement
of the reduction of TPt, the system equipped with another
C18 column (YMC, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), and the samples were
eluted by using a program as follows: 0% B (0 min) → 40% B
(15 min) → 60% B (20 min) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Preparative
HPLC was conducted on an Agilent Infinitylab LC/MSD 1260 system, equipped
with a reversed-phase C18 column (YMC 300 × 20 mm, 5 μm).
Pt content was measured by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
(ICP-MS) (PE Nexion 2000).

4.2 Synthesis of TPt
[Pt(DACH)(OH)2(ox)] and SZU101 were prepared following reported methods.24,40 [Pt(DACH)(OH)2(ox)] (50 mg, 0.115 mmol) was stirred in
DMSO (3 mL) with SZU101 (51 mg, 0.115 mol, 1 equiv), triethylamine
(14 mg, 19.4 μL, 0.138 mmol, 1.2 equiv), and TBTU (44.2 mg,
0.138 mmol, 1.2 equiv) overnight at room temperature (RT). The mixture
was centrifuged at 5000g, the supernatant was collected,
and DMSO was removed by lyophilization. The raw product was further
washed three times with water and then subjected to HPLC for purification.
Solvent A (H2O) and solvent B (acetonitrile) were used
for a gradient elution at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The samples were
eluted by using a program as follows: 20% B (0 min) → 100%
B (12 min) → 100% B (20 min). The final product was collected

4.3 Cell Culture
4T1 mouse breast carcinoma
was purchased from ATCC and cultured in complete Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin (HyClone), and
100 μg/mL streptomycin (HyClone). HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cells
were purchased from InvivoGen. The cell lines were maintained and
subcultured in growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50
μg/mL streptomycin, 100 mg/mL Normocin, 2 mM l-glutamine)
supplemented with 10 μg/mL of blasticidin and 100 μg/mL
of Zeocin. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were harvested
from 8-week-old Balb/c mice. BMDCs were cultured in BMDC primary media:
RPMI 1640 (HyClone), 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, 20 ng/mL GM-CSF (Sino Biological), and 10 ng/mL IL-4
(Sino Biological). All cell lines and assay cultures were maintained
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested regularly
for mycoplasma contamination, and none used tested positive at any
point.

4.3.1 CCK 8 Assay
The viability of cancer
cells exposed to the complexes was evaluated by CCK 8 assay. Cells
were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well
and incubated until the cell confluency reached 30%. Then, the medium
was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing different concentrations
of complexes with 0.5% DMF. After 48 h incubation, the medium was
aspirated and serum-free medium containing CCK 8 was added. After
2 h additional incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm of each well was
measured by using a Bio-Tek Quant microplate spectrophotometer.

4.3.2 Cellular Uptake Assay
Cells were
seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated until the cell confluency reached
80%. The medium was changed to fresh medium containing 10 μM
complex with 1% DMF. After 6 or 12 h exposure, cells were washed twice
with ice-cold PBS and collected by trypsinization. The cells were
subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 1 mL PBS.
The cell number was counted by hemocytometer. Then, the cells were
centrifuged and the cell pellets were digested by 65% nitric acid
and 15% H2O2 overnight at 65 °C. The lysate
was diluted to a final volume of 2 mL, and the Pt content was measured
by ICP-MS. The platinum levels in cells were expressed as ng Pt per
million cells.

4.3.3 Fluorescence Detection of Cell Surface Calreticulin
CRT exposure induced by TPt was evaluated by flow
cytometry. 4T1 cells were treated with SZU101, oxaliplatin or TPt at a dose of 100 μM for 24 h. Then, the cells were
collected, incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-CRT antibody (Abcam) for
30 min, and stained with Sytox Green (Abcam). The samples were analyzed
by flow cytometer (Attune NxT, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.). The
permeabilized cells (Sytox Green positive cells) were excluded from
the analysis, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for CRT was
analyzed.

4.3.4 Extracellular ATP Assay
The extracellular
release of ATP post TPt treatment was determined with
an ATP chemiluminescence assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). 4T1
cells were plated at 15 000 cells/well overnight and then treated
with SZU101, oxaliplatin or TPt at a dose of 100 μM
for 24 h. After incubation, the cell media were collected and centrifuged
at 2500 rpm × 10 min at 4 °C. The level of ATP in the supernatants
was measured by the commercial kit according to manufacturer’s
protocol. The final chemiluminescence was recorded on a Synergy H4
Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek).

4.3.5 TLR7 Stimulation Determined Using HEK-Blue
Assay
HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cells were plated at 2.2 ×
105 cells/mL density (180 μL) in 96-well plates using
HEK-Blue Detection medium (InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. HEK-Blue hTLR7 reporter cells were incubated individually
with 20 μL of each tested complex for 16 h at 37 °C in
a CO2 incubator. The absorbance (620 nm) was measured using
a Bio-Tek Quant microplate spectrophotometer.

4.4 Animal Assays
Female Balb/c mice
(6 weeks, 16–20 g) were purchased from the Guangdong Medical
Laboratory Animal Center (Guangdong, China). All animals were bred
and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at Shenzhen University.
All animal work was conducted under the approval of the Animal Ethics
Committee of Shenzhen University in accordance with the declaration
of Helsinki and Shenzhen University animal facility guidelines.

4.4.1 BMDC Harvest and Culture
Femur
bones were removed from 8-week-old Balb/c mice, and the bone marrow
was extracted into PBS buffer. The extract was made into a homogeneous
solution using a pipette and subsequently filtered through a 70 μm
cell strainer (BD Falcon). The filtrate was centrifuged at 1200 rpm
for 5 min at RT, and the supernatant was removed. ACK lysing buffer
(2 mL) was added to the cell pellet and incubated for 3 min at RT.
Then, PBS buffer (10 mL) was added to the cell suspension, and the
cell solution was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min at RT. The cell
pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for
5 min at RT. The cell pellet was resuspended in BMDC primary media.
Harvested cells were then counted and plated at 1 million cells per
well in 24-well plate (1 mL total media per well, day 0 of cell culture).
On day 2 and 4, a three quarters media change was performed. On day
5, the BMDCs were collected using a pipette, centrifuged at 1200 rpm
for 5 min at RT, and replated in 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/mL density for cytokine profile flow cytometry experiments.

4.4.2 Assays of Stimulated BMDCs Cytokine Concentration
BMDCs were incubated individually with each complex for 18 h. The
culture supernatants were collected and the IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ,
TNF-α, and IL-12p70 levels were determined by the multiplexed
cytometric bead array (Mouse/Rat Soluble Protein Master Buffer Kit,
CBA; BD Biosciences), as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.
Flow cytometry data were acquired by using Attune NxT Flow Cytometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) and analyzed with the FlowJo V10 software.

4.4.3 Tumor Inoculation and Intratumoral Tumor
Therapy
An inoculum of 2 × 105 4T1 cells
was injected s.c. on the right flank of mice in 100 μL sterile
PBS. Mice were randomized into four treatment groups on day 7 following
tumor inoculation when the diameter of the tumors reached 2–4
mm. PBS, SZU101, oxaliplatin, and TPt were administered
on days 7, 10, 13 at a dose of 5 μmol/kg (2 mg/kg for oxaliplatin,
2.44 mg/kg for SZU101, 4.3 mg/kg for TPt) intratumorally.
Mice weight, tumor length, and width were recorded every three days,
and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: volume (mm3) = ([width]2 × length)/2.

4.4.4 Analysis of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells
4T1-bearing mice were sacrificed on day 32. Tumors were resected,
weighed, and digested with collagenase type I (Sigma) and DNase I
(Sigma) to generate a single-cell suspension. The suspensions were
isolated by Percoll (GE) gradient centrifugation to obtain tumor-infiltrating
leukocytes. Cells were stained by incubation with the following fluorochrome-conjugated
antibodies: CD45 (30-F11), CD3 (17A1), CD4 (RM4-5), and CD8 (53-6.7)
(all from Biolegend) at RT for 15 min. Attune NxT flow cytometer was
used for cell acquisition and data analysis was carried out using
FlowJo software.

4.4.5 Immunofluorescence Assay of Immune Response
The excised tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room
temperature for 48 h, then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut
into thick slides. The slides were blocked with BSA and stained with
first antibodies: CD8 (YTS169.4, from Cell signaling technology) and
IFN-γ at 4 °C overnight. The slides were washed and stained
with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (from Servicebio in China)
at RT for 50 min. The slides were further stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
prior to observation at fluorescence microscope (NIKON ECLIPSE C1).

4.5 Statistical Analysis
All results
are expressed as means ± standard error (sem). Statistical analysis
was performed using the Prism statistical package (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). Normally distributed data were analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance with a p-test. A value of P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.
