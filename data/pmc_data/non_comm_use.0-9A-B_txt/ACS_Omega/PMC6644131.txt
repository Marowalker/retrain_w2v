A modular
platform based on free-radical xanthate addition to alkenes
enables access to a large series of functional γ-thiolactones.
This methodology includes two different pathways based on xanthate
chemistry involving radical addition and Chugaev elimination steps.
The first method uses the addition of an ester-functionalized xanthate
to various commercially functional alkenes, whereas the second one
is based on the addition of functional xanthates to an ester-functionalized
alkene. In both cases, a series of xanthate/alkene monoadducts was
obtained, and their thermolysis and subsequent cyclization led to
a library of functional γ-thiolactones in moderate to good yield.
For a few cases where it may not be possible to directly incorporate
some targeted functional groups via the proposed process involving
free radicals and high temperature, a bromo-functionalized thiolactone
was used as a starting material for chemical transformations.

Introduction
In contrast with lactone
monomers, which are widely used for the
synthesis of polyesters via ring-opening polymerization (ROP),1−3 thiolactones have barely been studied in ROP, with only a few attempts
being made in both homo-4−6 and copolymerization with other
cyclic monomers.7−9 Over the last decade, five-membered ring thiolactones
(γ-thiolactones) have received renewed interest with the work
of Du Prez et al. in the field of functional polymer synthesis. They
highlighted that amines could readily open γ-thiolactones to
generate a thiol that could be further reacted with a reactive double
bond in a one-pot procedure.10,11 The use of various
functionalized homocysteine thiolactones for this so-called amine–thiol–ene
conjugation reaction has led to the synthesis of a tremendous amount
of complex functional polymers,11,12 some exhibiting sequence-controlled
structures.13−17 Although this new reaction in polymer synthesis seems really promising,
the modified homocysteine thiolactones available show a relatively
limited structural diversity, with the amine group as the only possible
substitution site.11 Substitute groups
can be introduced using acid halides,18,19 carboxylic
acids,20 anhydrides,21 or a xanthate approach22 for
example. Furthermore, only a few synthetic procedures give access
to γ-thiolactones with limited functionalities, mainly through
alkylation of thiolactones,23 oxygen–sulfur
exchange on γ-butyrolactone,24,25 isomerization
of thionolactone,26 or acyl thiol–ene
cyclization.27

In a 1998 paper, Zard
et al. reported the first example of thiolactone
synthesis using xanthate radical chemistry. The proposed methodology
involved the use of an amine nucleophile and a strong acid catalyst
in order to convert the xanthate into a thiolactone.28

Recently, we came up with a simpler and more versatile
synthetic
route to access various original thiolactones based on xanthate chemistry.29 The procedure consists in the radical addition
of a xanthate to a functional unsaturated compound, followed by an
additive-free step involving a thermolysis reaction and subsequent
cyclization, leading to a functional γ-thiolactone. Using a
series of alkenes for the proof-of-concept study, we were able to
access different thiolactones and successfully used them to create
new functional polymers.29 In this report,
we present the scope and limitations of this xanthate-mediated synthesis
of thiolactones through two different synthetic pathways (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 General Scheme of
Two Different Pathways for the Synthesis of Functional
Thiolactones Using Xanthate Chemistry
Results and Discussion
In a recent work, we described
a synthetic procedure involving
the radical addition of an O-alkyl xanthate to a
substituted alkene, followed by the thermolysis of the resulting monoadduct
to form a transient thiol that reacts with an ester group present
on the starting xanthate to obtain the expected γ-thiolactone.
The versatility of the method was exemplified with a first series
of functional alkenes29 (Scheme 2, M1–9 and TL1–9), but it needed
to be further tested with more complex and reactive functional groups
in order to estimate its full potential.

Scheme 2 (A) General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Functional γ-Thiolactones
Using Pathway 1 and Resulting (B) Xanthate/Alkene 1:1 Adducts and
(C) Thiolactones
We selected a series of alkenes of different lengths bearing
ether,
bromide, hydroxyl, epoxide, pinacol boronate, and coumarin groups
and tested them in conditions established previously for xanthate
addition and thermolysis/cyclization steps.

The addition of XA1 to n-butyl vinyl
and allyl ethers formed the expected monoadducts M10 and M11 in good yield. The thermolysis of M10 at
190 °C did not result in the formation of the corresponding thiolactone. 1H NMR analysis of the crude mixture showed the total decomposition
of the xanthate group into the expected thiol. However, no cyclization
occurred even after a prolonged reaction time at 190 °C. Thermolysis
of M11 however led to the formation of thiolactone TL11 after 16 h with a good yield of 89% (Scheme 2). It seems that the presence
of an oxygen atom on the carbon bearing the thiol group inhibits the
thioesterification reaction. Therefore, a spacer of at least one carbon
atom is required to access γ-thiolactones bearing an ether functional
group.

We then tested four bromoalkenes of different lengths
with a view
to prepare a range of bromo-functional thiolactones (Scheme 3). Among allyl bromide, 4-bromo-1-butene,
5-bromo-1-pentene and 11-bromo-1-undecene reactants, only one thiolactone
was successfully obtained with 11-bromo-1-undecene. In the case of
allyl bromide and 4-bromo-1-butene, no reaction occurred between xanthate XA1 and the alkene. By increasing the distance between the
bromide and the double bond with the use of 5-bromo-1-pentene, we
obtained the expected monoadduct M12 by radical addition
of XA1 to the alkene with a moderate yield of 49%. Unfortunately,
the thermolysis of M12 did not lead to the formation
of a thiolactone but a tetrahydrothiophene derivative (THT1, Scheme 3) was revealed
instead by NMR analysis (Figure S37). The
thiol formed after the thermolysis of M12 did not perform
the expected thiolactonization, but an intramolecular nucleophilic
substitution on the bromine to form a stable tetrahydrothiophene was
favored. To avoid this side reaction, we used 11-bromo-1-undecene
instead. The radical addition of XA1 to the bromoalkene
occurred with a good yield of 80% to form monoadduct M13. Thermolysis of M13 allowed this time the formation
of thiolactone TL13 with a yield of 52% (Schemes 2 and 3). Our experimental procedure is therefore
suitable for the synthesis of bromo-functionalized thiolactones, but
the choice of the bromoalkene, especially the distance between the
bromide and the double bond, is crucial for both radical addition
and thiolactonization.

Scheme 3 Attempted Strategies for the Preparation
of Brominated Thiolactones
from Bromoalkene Precursors
Conditions for monoadduct
formation:
xanthate/alkene = 1:1, lauroyl peroxide (LPO), toluene, 90 °C,
16 h.

We recently reported the synthesis of
a first hydroxy-functional
γ-thiolactone using our xanthate-mediated method.30TL15 was obtained from 10-undecen-1-ol
and proved its usefulness as a platform for the introduction of several
new functions such as secondary and tertiary bromides, xanthates,
and an alcoxyamine.30 These thiolactones
were then used as reversible-deactivation radical polymerization agents
for atom transfer radical polymerization, reversible addition-fragmentation
chain transfer polymerization and nitroxide-mediated polymerization,
and nitroxide-mediated polymerization for the synthesis of a diversity
of thiolactone-terminated polymers of controlled chain length and
narrow molar mass distribution.30 We evaluated
the possibility of shortening the length of the spacer between the
hydroxyl group and the thiolactone ring. We selected allyl alcohol,
3-buten-1-ol, and 7-octene-1,2-diol to be reacted with either XA1 or XA2 or with both. The radical addition
of XA1 to allyl alcohol did not lead to the formation
of any product even after an extended period of time, as we observed
with allyl bromide.

However, contrary to 4-bromo-1-butene that
did not react at all,
the addition of XA1 and XA2 to 3-buten-1-ol
occurred and formed the corresponding monoadducts M15 and M16 with yields of 76 and 65%, respectively. The
thermolysis of M15 and M16 led to the corresponding
hydroxyl-functional thiolactones TL15 and TL16 with respective yields of 92 and 71% (Scheme 2). Finally, a dihydroxy thiolactone was successfully
synthesized by radical addition of XA1 to 7-octene-1,2-diol
to form the monoadduct M17 with a moderate yield of 49%,
followed by a thermolyzed to give the corresponding thiolactone TL17 with a good yield of 92% (Scheme 2).

We challenged other functionalities
of interest
such as an epoxide,
a methyl ester, a boronic ester, and a chromophore through the use
of 1,2-epoxydecene, methyl 2-methyl-4-pentenoate, allyl pinacol boronate,
and 4-(pent-4-en-1-hydroxy)2H-chromen-2-one. The
radical addition of XA1 to 1,2-epoxydecene and allyl
pinacol boronate ester gave the expected monoadducts M18 and M19 with similar yields of 75 and 74%, respectively
(Scheme 2). The heating
up of M19 at 190 °C for 5 h led to the formation
of the boronate pinacol ester-functionalized thiolactone with a yield
of 68% (Scheme 2).
The thermolysis of M18 and cyclization of the resulting
product at 190 °C required 7 h to reach a similar yield of 67%
and the formation of the epoxide-functionalized thiolactone TL18 (Scheme 2). The radical addition of XA1 to 4-(pent-4-en-1-hydroxy)2H-chromen-2-one occurred with a low yield of 37%, and the
subsequent thermolysis of monoadduct M20 gave thiolactone TL20 with a yield of 57% (Scheme 2).

The last functionality we introduced
through this pathway was a
methyl ester group. To do so, xanthate XA1 and methyl
2-methyl-4-pentenoate as the olefinic substrate were judiciously selected
in order to obtain a symmetrical monoadduct M21 with
a yield of 73%. Once the xanthate group was cleaved at 190 °C
to form a thiol, two thiolactonization pathways became possible (Scheme 4), with the thiol
potentially reacting with either the methyl ester group of the xanthate
or that brought by the alkene. It is worth mentioning that apart from
this particular case, the thermolysis of a monoadduct bearing two
different kinds of ester groups coming from the xanthate and the alkene
would lead to mixtures of ester-functional thiolactones.

Scheme 4 Monoadduct M21 Leads to Thiolactone TL21 According to Two
Distinct Mechanistic Pathways
The thermolysis of M21 at 190 °C required
48
h to form the expected thiolactone TL21 with a good yield
of 89% (Scheme 4).

The synthetic route to TL21 inspired us to develop
a second pathway to access functional thiolactones using the same
elemental reactions. Whereas the first methodology we proposed brought
the functionality to the thiolactone through the functional alkene
with thiolactone ring formation via the reaction of the thiol with
the ester group from the initial xanthate, the newly proposed strategy
involves the formation of the thiolactone ring through the reaction
of the thiol and the ester group of the alkene, giving the possibility
of introducing the thiolactone functionality from a functional xanthate
(Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 (A) General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Thiolactones through Pathway
2 and (B) Resulting Xanthate/Alkene 1:1 Adducts and Thiolactones
We thus synthesized and screened
four different xanthates to probe
the limitations of this new process. We selected four different xanthates
with benzyl (XA3), 1-phenylethyl (XA4),
phthalimido (XA5), and cyanomethyl (XA6)
leaving groups. The radical addition of both XA3 and XA4 to methyl 2-methyl-4-pentenoate failed to form the corresponding
monoadduct. On the other hand, the addition of XA5 and XA6 to methyl 2-methyl-4-pentenoate occurred to afford monoadducts M22 with a moderate yield of 40% and M23 with
a much better yield of 79% (Scheme 5). Thiolactone TL22 could be obtained
from the thermolysis of M22 for 24 h with an efficient
thiolactonization proven by 1H NMR of the crude mixture
but with a low isolated yield of 30% due to a loss of product during
the purification step. Under the same conditions, M23 was converted into a mixture of the expected thiolactone TL23 and its trimer. The high temperature of 190 °C associated with
an extended reaction time of 24 h led to the cyclotrimerization of
the cyano group of the thiolactone in the neat reaction mixture. To
avoid this side reaction, the experimental protocol was slightly modified,
and the thermolysis was run on a diluted solution of M23 in dichlorobenzene at 190 °C for 24 h. This time, no cyclotrimer
was obtained, and thiolactone TL23 was obtained with
a 70% yield.

This alternative method of thiolactone synthesis
(Scheme 5) was found
to be less versatile
than the first one we developed. From the few tested xanthates, to
date, only two thiolactones with functionalities of limited interest
were obtained.

Although the xanthate-mediated synthesis of thiolactones
is very
versatile, some functional groups sensitive to radicals or high temperature
may not be compatible with this synthetic procedure. To overcome this
drawback and introduce new functionalities on the thiolactone ring,
postfunctionalization of the thiolactone has to be considered (Scheme 6). As mentioned earlier,
we recently used this strategy to introduce bromides, xanthates, and
an alkoxyamine functional group by an efficient transformation of
the hydroxyl-functional thiolactone TL14.30 Among the thiolactones synthesized, we considered
bromo-functionalized thiolactone TL13 to be an interesting
platform for the introduction of further functionalities.

Scheme 6 Synthesis
of Functional Thiolactones via the Postfunctionalization
of a Bromo-Functionalized Thiolactone
Nucleophilic substitution of TL13 with sodium
azide,
sodium ethanethiosulfonate, and the xanthate salt XAK led to the formation of an azide- (TL24), a thiosulfonate-
(TL25), and a xanthate-functional thiolactone (TL26) with very good yields of, respectively, 86, 96, and
91% (Scheme 6). Furthermore, TL27 bearing a xanthate functionality could be thermolyzed
to give the corresponding thiol-functional thiolactone TL27 in 87% yield (Scheme 6).

Conclusions
In summary, we report the synthesis of functional
thiolactones
through consecutive radical addition of xanthate to a functional alkene,
high-temperature Chugaev elimination of the xanthate group, and ring
closure of the resulting mercapto ester. Depending on the nature of
the xanthate and the functional alkene, two different pathways give
access to the target thiolactones, although only one was found to
be truly versatile. The first pathway allows the introduction of a
wide range of functionalities, with some limitations with reactive
groups such as Br and OH that need to be borne by alkenes of a certain
length to be able to obtain the desired thiolactone. A total of 18
γ-thiolactones was synthesized following this procedure. The
second pathway involves the same elemental reactions but uses a functional
xanthate in combination with an ester-functionalized alkene. This
particular procedure requires the synthesis of a specific xanthate
for each targeted thiolactone and the xanthates itself should add
to the ester-functional alkene, which did not occur in several cases.
To date, only two novel thiolactones bearing cyano and phthalimido
groups could be synthesized according to this procedure. One particular
case was found with the xanthate XA1–methyl 2-methyl-4-pentenoate
pair, which leads to the formation of an ester-functional thiolactone
according to both pathways 1 and 2 due to the symmetrical nature of
the monoadduct (Scheme 4). Finally, we used a bromo-functionalized thiolactone as a platform
to introduce several functional groups we thought might be incompatible
with free-radical conditions and elevated temperatures. As a whole,
xanthate-mediated synthesis of γ-thiolactones was found to be
a powerful synthetic tool allowing direct access to pure functional
thiolactones on a several-gram scale, with also the possibility to
be further functionalized. This ease of access to a new generation
of highly reactive building blocks will undoubtedly open new application
perspectives in the fields of polymer synthesis and modification and
materials surface functionalization.
