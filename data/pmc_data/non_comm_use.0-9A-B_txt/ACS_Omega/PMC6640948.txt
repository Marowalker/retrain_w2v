The wavelength-dependent complex
linear polarizability of a dye
is a crucial input for the modeling of the optical properties of dye-containing
systems. We here propose and discuss methods to obtain an accurate
polarizability model by combining absorption spectrum measurements,
Kramers–Kronig (KK) tranformations, and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. We focus, in particular, on the real part
of the polarizability and its link with static polarizability. In
addition, we introduce simple KK-consistent analytic functions based
on the theory of critical points as a much more accurate approach
to model dye polarizabilities compared with existing models based
on Lorentz oscillators. Accurate polarizability models based on critical
points and DFT calculations of the static polarizability are derived
for five commonly used dyes: Rhodamine 6G, Rhodamine 700, Crystal
Violet, Nile Blue A, and Methylene Blue. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly,
using examples of Mie Theory calculations of nanoparticle–dye
interactions, how an inaccurate polarizability model can result in
fundamentally different predictions, further emphasizing the importance
of accurate models, such as the one proposed here.

1 Introduction
The
optical properties of dye molecules are routinely exploited
in a wide variety of contexts including the following: as gain media
in dye lasers,1 as fluorescent tags in
many biological sensing and imaging techniques,2,3 as
reporters in surface-enhanced spectroscopies4,5 or
spectroelectrochemistry,6 and as catalysts
for photoredox chemistry.7 One of their
central characteristics is their absorption spectrum, which can be
easily measured by ultraviolet/visible transmission spectroscopy.
This spectrum indicates the position of the main electronic resonances
of the dye and therefore provides the most important input for theoretical
modeling of the optical properties of the dyes in most contexts. Most
theoretical models of the optical properties of dye-containing systems,
however, require knowledge of the wavelength-dependent complex linear
optical polarizability α(λ). For this, one or several
Lorentz oscillator profiles with resonances matching the absorption
spectrum are often employed. The other parameters (broadening and
relative peak intensities) are also sometimes obtained from a fit
to the experimental absorption spectrum, which is closely related
to the imaginary part of the polarizability. We argue in this work
that this common approach presents a number of shortcomings:the absolute amplitude of the polarizability
is rarely
rigorously determined;

the entire spectral
shape is not well reproduced by
a Lorentz model;

the real part of the
polarizability is not correctly
determined.



The first point will naturally
affect any quantitative predictions.
Although the other two points may appear less important, we will in
fact show that they are critical to the correctness of theoretical
predictions. We propose alternative methods to remedy those shortcomings
and obtain an accurate polarizability. For convenience, we also propose
a class of possible analytical fits suitable for typical dyes and
demonstrate their applicability to five commonly used dyes: Rhodamine
6G, Rhodamine 700, Crystal Violet, Nile Blue A, and Methylene Blue.
Our arguments are general but will be illustrated on the topical case
of dye–nanoparticle hybrid systems.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Determination of an Accurate
Dye Polarizability
2.1.1 General Considerations
The complex
linear optical polarizability at a given wavelength λ (or frequency
ω = 2πc/λ) is a physical quantity
relating the optical response of a dye, characterized by an oscillating
induced dipole p(t), to an electromagnetic
excitation characterized by an electromagnetic field E(t) oscillating at the same frequency. Using complex
notations for oscillating quantities, that is, A(t) = Re[A e–iωt] and assuming a linear response, this results in
the simple relation: p = α̃E. As this is a microscopic property, E in this expression
should be understood as the microscopic electric field, which differs
from the macroscopic field when the dye is embedded in a medium like
water. The two quantities are simply related using an appropriate
local-field correction.4,8,9 Within
this definition, α̃ therefore corresponds to the polarizability in vacuum, and the solvent effect is accounted
for by the local-field correction (see first term in eq 1 below). We therefore assume that
the chemical structure of the dye is unchanged when dissolved in water.
In principle, α̃ is a tensor, but in many situations the
optical properties are averaged over a large number of dyes with random
orientations. In this case (and assuming no optical activity), the
results only depend on a scalar effective polarizability defined as
α = (1/3)Tr(α̃) = (1/3)(α̃xx + α̃yy +
α̃zz), where Tr(·) denotes
the trace of the tensor. For simplicity, we will focus primarily on
this effective polarizability in this work, but the discussion equally
applies to tensorial polarizabilities. For the common case of a dye
with a uniaxial response (assumed along the z axis),
we, for example, simply have αzz = 3α. In general, α is complex; as for any linear response
function, its imaginary part is related to losses, and its real part
to dispersion.

2.1.2 Imaginary Part
α(λ)
is difficult to fully measure directly for a dye. However, its imaginary
part over a finite wavelength range can be obtained from the absorption
spectrum or equivalently the absorption cross section σabs(λ). For example, for a dye in a solution of refractive
index nM, we have (see Section 4.6.2 in
ref (4)). 1  We note
that the first term is related to
the local-field correction8,9 and is often incorrectly
omitted, leading to errors in the absolute magnitude of α (this
term is, for example, of the order 0.63 in water). For dyes in solution,
scattering is negligible, and the absorption spectrum can therefore
be measured from standard UV/vis (extinction) spectroscopy.

2.1.3 Real part
The real part of the
complex polarizability can, in principle, be inferred from the imaginary
part through the Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations,10−12 which are a consequence of causality for a linear response function
like α.13 Those are typically expressed
in terms of frequency rather than wavelength, namely 2  where  denotes
the Cauchy principal value. To
compute this integral, one, moreover, needs to use the symmetry property13 3  This approach can be
cumbersome in practice
due to the integration and the principal value (an example implementation
in Matlab is given as Supporting Information for convenience). Alternatively, the imaginary part can be fitted
using an analytic function that is KK consistent by construction.
We will come back to this approach in Section 2.2 and focus here on the use of the KK transform
to obtain an accurate real part of the polarizability.

It is
important to first note that the use of eq 2 requires knowledge of the imaginary part
over the entire spectral range where transitions occur, which, for
dyes, should include, in particular, all the UV/near-UV transitions.
To illustrate this, the absorption spectrum of Rhodamine 6G in water
was measured using UV–vis spectroscopy over the range 200–1000
nm. The imaginary part of α is derived using eq 1, see Figure 1a, and assumed to be zero outside that range.
The real part is then calculated numerically from the KK integrals
(eqs 2 and 3) and shown in Figure 1b. The effect of including UV peaks is also investigated by
comparing this to the same calculation but setting the absorbance
to zero below 400 nm. The difference between the two, that is, the
real part of the polarizability due to UV absorption, is shown in
the inset of Figure 1b. As expected, this exhibits strong features in the near-UV region
but also a nonzero contribution above 400 nm. If we are only interested
in the response in the visible region, then this contribution from
the UV peaks is real and approximately constant at αUV = 2.6 × 10–39 S.I. This value is large enough
to affect theoretical predictions quantitatively and qualitatively
in some cases and must therefore be taken into account.

part of the polarizability of Rhodamine 6G, as obtained
using eq 1 from its UV–vis
absorption spectrum including the near-UV peaks down to 200 nm (red)
or only the peaks above 400 nm (blue). The molecular structure of
Rhodamine 6G is also shown as an inset. (b) Real part of the polarizability
of Rhodamine 6G calculated from the KK transformation of (a) with
(red) or without (blue) the near-UV peaks (<400 nm) included. The
difference between the two is shown in the inset and shows the effective
contribution to the real polarizability from the UV peaks is approximately
constant in the visible part of the spectrum (above ∼450 nm).

2.1.4 Link
to Static Polarizability
It
is not, however, always practical to measure the absorption spectrum
over this wide range, and higher-energy transitions could also exist
below 200 nm in some systems. It is therefore desirable to provide
an alternative method based on the measurement of the visible spectrum
only. Because the UV contribution to α(λ) is approximately
constant in the visible range (Figure 1b), we can write the polarizability in the visible
range as 4  where αvis(λ) is the
polarizability obtained via KK transform or analytical fits of the
visible region only and αconstant is a real constant
accounting for the contribution of all the higher-energy transitions.
To determine αconstant without measuring the entire
spectrum, we propose to use the asymptotic behavior of the polarizability
at long wavelength: α(λ → ∞) has a very
precise physical meaning as it can be identified with the (real) static
electric polarizability of the dye αstatic, that
is, the response of the dye to an applied electric field in the DC
limit. For example, from the measurement of the full absorption spectrum
of Rhodamine 6G in Figure 1, we can deduce by KK integration that αstatic = 6. 1 × 10–39 S.I. This is a lower estimate
as it assumes that there is no optical absorption below 200 nm. Conversely,
from a knowledge of the static polarizability, we can adjust the constant
offset αconstant in eq 4 to ensure that α(λ → ∞)
= αstatic. To avoid measuring the full spectrum,
one therefore only needs an independent method of determining αstatic.

2.1.5 DFT Estimates of the
Static Polarizability
We argue that DFT calculations (as
detailed in the Section 4) can achieve this to a sufficient
accuracy. From those, the static polarizability tensor in vacuum is
calculated and the effective scalar static polarizability derived
as α = (1/3)Tr(α̃). For example, for Rhodamine 6G
(R6G) we obtain αDFT = 6. 94 × 10–39 S.I., in good agreement with the lowest bound deduced from the full
spectrum measurement. Similar conclusions were reached by comparing
measurements and DFT calculations of other common dyes as summarized
in Table 1. The level
of agreement suggests that both approaches provide a reliable estimate
of the vacuum static polarizability. This provides strong reassurance
of the validity of the real polarizability determined from a full-spectrum
measurement of the dye absorption. Moreover, one could also use the
DFT prediction for the static polarizability in conjunction with an
absorption spectrum measurement in the region of interest only (which
should, nevertheless, include all the lower-energy peaks) to determine
an accurate polarizability over that region.

a The two values
show good agreement
across the investigated dyes, indicating that both are reasonable
choices for the static polarizability. The contribution of UV peaks
(corresponding to the error if the 200–400 nm region is removed
from the KK integral) is also explicitly given for reference.

It is worth emphasizing that we
here use DFT to compute vacuum static polarizabilities.
The solvent effect is taken
into account through its local-field correction only (eq 1). One could alternatively directly
compute from DFT the polarizability in water using, for example, polarizability
continuum models.14,15 Such an approach would potentially
account for solvent-induced changes in the chemical structure in addition
to local-field effects. However, the level of agreement observed in Table 1 suggests that those
effects are secondary to the local-field effects, at least in the
cases studied here.

2.2 Analytical Fits of the
Dye Polarizability
While the KK method from eq 2 provides a direct relationship
between Im(α) and Re(α),
it requires numerical integration. The integral contains a pole when
ω = ω′ and is evaluated using the Cauchy method
by taking the principal value of the integral. The method is therefore
not as straightforward as an analytical fit to the experimental data.
Moreover, any noise in the experimental data could have a large impact
on the KK transformation for frequency values in the vicinity of the
pole and may lead to incorrect values for Re[α]. Thus, the alternative
of fitting the imaginary part using an analytic function that is KK
consistent by construction is appealing. As discussed earlier, the
contribution of high-energy transitions may be approximated as an
additional constant. Often, a single peak is not enough to accurately
describe the dye absorption spectrum and one may then use a sum of
peaks 5  where αj is the contribution from
the jth peak in the absorption
spectrum.

2.2.1 Lorentz and Voigt models
The simplest
and most commonly used KK-consistent function for a resonance peak
is the Lorentz oscillator (written here in terms of wavelength rather
than frequency) 6  where αj, λj, and Γj are parameters to
be determined, related to the amplitude,
resonance wavelength, and broadening, respectively. The imaginary
part is then very similar to a Lorentzian. However, although such
fits qualitatively describe the location of the dye resonances, they
rarely provide an accurate quantitative fit to the absorption spectrum,
especially to the low-energy tail of the lower-energy peak. A more
accurate fit of the absorption spectrum could be achieved with a Gaussian
profile. The simplest KK-consistent model achieving this is a Voigt-type
lineshape, which has been used to model the dielectric function of
solids16 but only sporadically in the context
of dye polarizability.17,18 It represents a collection of
Lorentz oscillators whose resonance frequencies are Gaussian distributed.
It is therefore KK consistent by construction and its imaginary part
is very similar to the Voigt profile, explicitly 7  The Lorentz model is compared with a more
accurate fit based on the Voigt model in Figure 2, where we focus on the main absorption (low
energy) peak of Rhodamine 6G at 526 nm. In both cases, αconstant was adjusted to ensure the same static polarizability
of α(λ → ∞) = αstatic =
6.94 × 10–39 S.I, and eq 1 is used to link the absorption cross section
to the imaginary part of the polarizability. It is obvious that the
two fits are significantly different outside the immediate region
of the 526 nm peak, with the Lorentzian having a pronounced tail extending
too far in the low-energy region, where the optical absorption shows
a sharp drop, as expected, for a discrete electron energy transition
broadened only by absorption from different thermally excited states.
Also, the difference in the value of the real part (Figure 2b) is evident below ∼450
nm, where the two fits lead to differing near-constant values of the
real part. The two models, in fact, predict a different sign for the
real part of the polarizability in this region. Such a difference
can be crucial to obtaining the correct qualitative predictions, as
will be shown in Section 2.3. An additional constant could be added to the Lorentz polarizability
to make the real parts of both models agree below ∼450 nm,
but this conversely leads to a discrepancy at α(λ →
∞), which would be equivalent to arbitrarily changing the static
polarizability of the dye. It is therefore clear from Figure 2 that small inaccuracies in
the fit of the imaginary part (in particular, the correct lineshape)
have large implications on the accuracy of the real part of the polarizability,
which has, thus far, been largely overlooked in most models in the
literature.

a single Lorentz oscillator (green) or a single Voigt fit (blue).
(b) Corresponding real part of the polarizability functions where
the condition α(λ → ∞) = αstatic = 6. 94 × 10–39 S.I. is enforced for both
Lorentzian and Voigt fits.

2.2.2 Critical Points Fits
We therefore
focus on obtaining accurate KK-consistent fits of the absorption spectrum
in the visible. For this, two transitions are needed for Rhodamine
6G, as shown in Figure 3a,b. A double Lorentz fit is inadequate as it tails too far into
the low-energy region, as discussed before. The double Voigt fit is
significantly better and also predicts the correct real part when
compared with that of the direct KK method (Figure 3b). However, it is, like the KK transformation,
more computationally challenging because of its integral form (eq 7). It is, thus, desirable
to find a simpler, yet accurate, closed-form analytic functional fit.

(purple) with a polarizability modeled as two Lorentz (green) or two
Voigt (blue) oscillators. (b) Corresponding real parts of the polarizability,
compared with that obtained from the KK transformation of the experimental
data. A constant is added in each case to enforce the condition α(λ
→ ∞) = αstatic = 6. 94 × 10–39 S.I. (c, d) Same as (a, b) with a double critical
point fit (red). The inset in (c) shows the individual contributions
of each of the two critical points. The black dotted line in (d) delineates
the region for which the fit is better than 10% for both the real
and imaginary parts.

To this end, we propose employing a critical point approach.
Critical
points were originally introduced in the context of semiconductors.19−21 The absorption of semiconductors occurs at the positions of the
Van Hove singularities in the joint density of states (jDOS),22 and critical point lineshapes can be used to
model the optical properties associated with these poles. They have
also, more recently, been used to model the dielectric functions of
metals.22,23 We here propose and demonstrate that such
functions, which are KK-consistent by construction, can also be used
to model the polarizability of dyes. We will use the following functional
form23 8  where Aj, λj, γj, ϕj and μj are parameters. Aj relates to the amplitude, λj to the resonance wavelength, and γj to the broadening. ϕj is
a phase factor resulting in an asymmetry of the absorption peak. μj is here not used as a fitting parameter
but can be used to describe different classes of fits (in a formal
critical point derivation, it would be associated with the order of
the pole in the jDOS). We found that values of μj of either 1 or 2 were adequate for most of our fits.
It is also worth noting that the first term in the critical point
expression will dominate the function as the second (off-resonant)
term is negligible in the region where λ ≈ λj. It is, nevertheless, important to include
it to achieve KK consistency.

The visible absorption spectrum
of Rhodamine 6G was fitted with
two critical points, as shown in Figure 3c,d. The resulting fits are comparable in
quality to the Voigt fits showing that the proposed model can be used
as a simpler yet equally effective alternative to the Voigt function
and is a distinct improvement on the commonly used Lorentz oscillator.
The usefulness of the critical point fit is further demonstrated by
applying it to other common dyes: Rhodamine 700, Crystal Violet, Methylene
Blue, and Nile Blue A. The fits and their respective parameters are
given in the Supporting Information. In
all those cases, only the absorption peaks in the visible region are
fitted and the real part is corrected using the static polarizability
obtained from DFT, as explained in the previous section.

Due
to the stated importance of the UV peaks for the correct determination
of the real polarizability, it is important to find the region of
validity of this approach by comparing it to that obtained from the
KK transform of experimental data, including UV peaks. In the case
of Rhodamine, shown in Figure 3c,d, the critical point model has a relative error of less
than 10% for both the real and imaginary parts of the polarizability
over the entire range above ∼470 nm (note that the regions
where the real part crosses zero are excluded from this analysis to
avoid the singularity). This reduces to 6% above 475 nm. For accurate
predictions below these wavelengths, we recommend adding analytical
fits to represent the near-UV transitions or using the explicit KK
transform of experimental data containing higher-energy transitions.
A similar analysis was carried out for other dyes, as summarized in
the Supporting Information.

Finally,
it is worth pointing out that the critical point model
for dyes, although KK-consistent and accurate, does not necessarily
have a direct physical interpretation. As seen in the inset of Figure 3c, the individual
critical point contributions, when considered separately, may exhibit
negative absorbance in certain regions. This is unphysical and shows
that a single critical point with arbitrary parameters cannot, in
general, be used to model a single electronic transition. However,
the overall fit, through the summation of these contributions, provides
an accurate KK-consistent representation of the polarizability. In
the interest of simplifying expressions for the polarizability, critical
points can therefore be used as a substitute for Voigt fits, especially
to accurately fit the low-energy tail of the spectra. With this in
mind, we believe that a sum of Lorentz oscillators and critical points
should provide a practical and accurate description of the polarizability
of most molecular dyes over any region of interest (which may or may
not include the UV/near-UV peaks). Several examples are included in
the Supporting Information.

2.3 Application to Nanoparticle–Dye Interactions
While our arguments are quite general, we now illustrate them in
the topical case of dye–metal nanoparticle hybrids. Indeed,
there has been a significant and ongoing effort to understand and
exploit the interaction between the surface plasmon resonance of a
substrate, such as a metallic nanoparticle, and the optical resonance
of molecules adsorbed onto its surface. The coupling between those
two resonances leads to a molecule–nanostructure hybrid with
distinct modified optical properties.24−27 Depending on the strength of
this coupling, this may result in resonance shifts, peak splitting,
and the appearance of Fano profiles. Anticrossing of the resonances
as a function of coupling strength has been observed in several systems.
Gold or silver nanoparticles or nanoshells are typically used as substrates
and are coupled to quantum emitters, such as excitons in J-aggregates,25,27−31 quantum dots,32,33 and isolated dye molecules.18,26,34 The novel properties of the resulting
hybrid states have been earmarked for advancement in surface-enhanced
spectroscopies,4,24,34 molecular sensing,24,34,35 lasing,24,26,34,35 as well as building blocks for quantum information
systems.26

In the vast majority of
those studies, the optical properties of the dye layer are generally
modeled with a single25−27,29,31,32 or double34 Lorentz oscillator, with no considerations made to the
shortcomings discussed earlier. In particular, little or no effort
is devoted to rigorously match the absolute polarizability amplitude
to the measured absorption cross section using eq 1 (which may arbitrarily affect the coupling
strength) or to find an accurate αconstant or αstatic. We argue that an accurate model of the polarizability
(both imaginary and real parts) is, in fact, crucial to any quantitative
predictions and even qualitative interpretations in some cases.

For this, we used Mie theory and the effective shell model18,27,28,31,36−40 to calculate the optical response of silver nanoparticles
coated with a thin layer of adsorbed dyes. The effect of the difference
in the real part of different functions for the polarizability on
plasmon–molecule interactions can be investigated by comparing
the predicted absorbance of the dye on the nanoparticle surface. For
illustration, the dye was assumed to have a single resonance at 526
nm, as in Figure 2.
Representative results of those calculations are summarized in Figure 4. For a surface dye
layer with a relatively high concentration of molecules, the absorption
signal of the dye is strong enough to be observed in the predicted
extinction spectrum of the dye-coated colloid, as shown in Figure 4a, where the differences
between the polarizability models are observable. With the Voigt lineshape,
we observe an intense, sharp dye resonance peak (akin to those observed
in J-aggregates), whereas a much lower broad peak is predicted if
the Lorentz model is used. A difference in the dye resonance peak
position is predicted by the two models as well as a small difference
in the colloid resonance intensity. If we shift the dye resonance
to 460 nm to increase coupling, we again observe a large discrepancy
between the two models as shown in Figure 4b. If the Voigt model is used, the predicted
absorption spectrum shows a dip, that is, a seeming splitting of the
colloid resonance, commonly associated with the strong coupling regime,
whereas the Lorentz model predicts only minor modifications of the
colloid resonance under these conditions. We do not intend to discuss
the meaning of those shifts/splittings here but simply to point out
the fact that two polarizability models with identical resonances
can result in drastically different predictions just because they
have slightly different spectral shapes around the resonance. Thus,
qualitatively different conclusions may be reached simply by choosing
a different model for the polarizability.

Figure 4 (a) Predicted extinction
spectrum of the 60 nm diameter silver
nanoparticles coated with a uniform dye layer of 0.2 dye molecules
per nm2 (∼1000 dyes per NP) with polarizabilities
given by either the same Lorentz (green) or Voigt (blue) models as
in Figure 2. Same as
(b) with the resonance shifted to 460 nm to increase coupling. (c)
Same as (a) for a low-coverage dye layer of 0.01 molecules per nm2 on the colloid surface. The differential extinction spectrum
(where the colloid-only spectrum has been subtracted) is shown to
highlight the influence of the dye layer. The dashed line shows the
result for the Lorentz oscillator where a real constant has been added
to make it coincide with the Voigt model in the 450 nm region, as
shown as a dashed line in Figure 2b (note that this also changes α(λ →
∞) and could not represent the same physical dye). (d) Same
as (c) but showing differential absorption instead of extinction.

Similar observations can be made
for low dye concentrations. In
this case, the dye/nanoparticle interactions can be revealed by considering
the differential extinction (Figure 4c) and differential absorbance (Figure 4d) spectra of the colloid–molecule
system, referenced against the colloid-only system.18 The region of the nanoparticle quadrupole peak, around
375 nm, is an excellent example of the importance of the real part,
as the peak is sufficiently far away from the dye resonance that the
imaginary parts of the two models are equivalent in this region and
will therefore not affect the predicted coupling. The feature observed
in Figure 4c,d at ∼375
nm is indicative of a wavelength shift of the quadrupole peak. If
the Voigt lineshape is used, we observe a redshift, whereas a small
blueshift is predicted in the Lorentz case. This remarkable discrepancy
can, in fact, be simply explained: It is well documented that plasmon
resonances redshift/blueshift for the higher/lower refractive index
of the surrounding medium and here the sign of the real part of the
dye polarizability governs whether the refractive index of the dye
layer is higher (for a positive real part) or lower (negative real
part) than that of the surrounding medium, here water. To confirm
this interpretation, one can add a constant to the Lorentz polarizability
to make the real parts of both models identical in the region of the
colloid quadrupole peak (as shown as a dashed line in Figure 2b), and a similar shift is
then observed for both models. The addition of this real constant
is, however, unphysical, as it also changes the static polarizability
of the dye. The fact that the predicted results, even on a qualitative
level, can be strikingly different with small differences in either
the spectral shape or the static polarizability shows the importance
of using a model accurately representing those aspects.

3 Conclusions
The wavelength-dependent complex linear
polarizability is, arguably,
the most important parameter when modeling the optical properties
of dyes interacting in a variety of contexts. While a simple Lorentz
oscillator captures mostly the influence of the dye resonance positions,
we have highlighted in this work a number of additional aspects playing
a critical role under some circumstances, notably, the spectral shape
of the absorption peaks around the resonance and the offset in the
real part of the polarizability. We have discussed, in detail, the
factors affecting the correct determination of those parameters and
proposed practical methods for obtaining an accurate dye polarizability.
The use of the static polarizability, as calculated from DFT, was,
in particular, shown to be an effective way of accounting for high-energy
transitions that cannot always be measured. In addition, we have proposed
and applied an alternative closed-form analytic model based on critical
point analysis for the polarizability of dyes and investigated its
applicability and range of validity for five common dyes: Rhodamine
6G, Rhodamine 700, Crystal Violet, Nile Blue A, and Methylene Blue.
This model represents a significant improvement over the Lorentz oscillator
model, as well as an equally effective substitute for cumbersome methods,
such as the numerical integration of the KK transform or the Voigt
polarizability model.

The importance of an accurate polarizability
model, and, in particular,
a correct value of the real part of the polarizability, on theoretical
electromagnetic models of dye systems was demonstrated through examples
of Mie Theory calculations of nanoparticle–dye interactions.
Different polarizability models and different values for the static
polarizability can lead to qualitatively and quantitatively different
theoretical predictions. We expect that a more careful modeling of
the dye polarizability, such as the one proposed here, will be of
great benefit to further our understanding of the mechanisms governing
dye–nanoparticle interactions.

8453 Diode Array Single Beam UV–Visible Spectrophotometer.
A quartz cuvette was used to obtain spectral information down to ∼200
nm. A single 5 mL cuvette was used for all measurements to avoid any
spectral changes due to cuvette variation.

DFT calculations
were used to predict the static polarizability
of dyes. Specifically, we used the package Gaussian0941 and employed the hybrid functional PBE042−44 with the triple
zeta basis set def2tzvp(45,46) to perform molecular geometry optimizations and polarizability calculations.

Theoretical predictions of the optical properties of a dye layer
were carried out using an isotropic shell model, as used in many recent
studies of molecular plasmonics.18,27,28,31,36−40 This consists of solving the electromagnetic scattering problem
for a metallic nanosphere covered by a thin spherical shell with an
effective isotropic dielectric function that models the dye response.
For simplicity, the local-field correction arising from dye/dye interactions
is neglected, as is common practice (although this assumption has
recently been questioned18). The local-field
correction due to the embedding medium (typically water) with dielectric
constant ϵM must, however, be taken into account.8 The effective dielectric function therefore takes
the form ϵ(λ) = ϵM + [(ϵM + 2)/3][cD/ϵ0]α(λ),
where cD is the number of dye molecules
per unit volume.18 Calculations were performed
in Matlab with publicly available codes.47 The dielectric function of silver is taken from the analytical fit
in ref (4).
