Au
nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 20 nm with a coverage
of ∼20% of the surface were distributed on a Si wafer surface
and studied both before and after being annealed (at 100 and 300 °C).
The two types of samples were analyzed using secondary ion mass spectroscopy
(SIMS) with Bi3+ clusters as the primary ions
combined with surface etching using Ar1000+ clusters.
We observed a substantial difference in the SIMS spectra combined
with a relatively short sputtering time of Ar1000+. In the nonannealed samples, bare Au cluster cations and Si+ were observed in the SIMS spectra; AuSi+ clusters
were also observed in the annealed samples. These results indicate
Au-silicide formation at a part of the periphery of the Au nanoparticles
upon annealing. We suggest that SIMS experiments using cluster ions
such as Bi3+ can not only be used for surface
elemental analyses but also provide information on local chemical
environments of elements on the surface. This is an important issue
in heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., strong metal–support interactions).
We also advise that one should be careful interpreting the SIMS data
combined with a longer Ar1000+ sputtering time
because this can deteriorate the surfaces from their original structures.

1 Introduction
In
heterogeneous catalysis studies, surface analysis tools play
a crucial role in unveiling the nature of active sites, such as their
oxidation states and chemical environments, in catalytically active
structures.1−7 Most heterogeneous catalysts consist of catalytically active metal
or metal oxide nanoparticles supported by high surface area oxides
such as alumina and silica.4,7−10 The nanoparticle–support interaction is very important because
it not only determines stability of the nanoparticles but also the
chemical nature of active sites at nanoparticle–support interfaces.10−15

Most surface analysis tools are based on the detection of
low-energy
electrons emitted from solid surfaces and are induced by either photons
or high-energy electrons.3−5,16−21 For example, X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
rely on photoemission processes,3,5,16−18 whereas Auger electron spectroscopy and electron
energy loss spectroscopy use high-energy electrons as primary particles.4,10,19−21 These tools
are useful for obtaining information about surface chemical compositions,
electronic structures, and oxidation states of elements on solid surfaces.
However, information about local coordination of atoms on surfaces,
particularly heterogeneous surfaces such as oxides covered by metal
or metal oxide nanoparticles, is not easy to obtain,14,22−24 and it is difficult to determine whether atoms in
nanoparticles and supporting materials interact chemically or physically
at the interfaces. XPS can be used as a tool to obtain information
about metal–support interactions. However, XPS peaks measured
at the periphery and the core of the nanoparticles are often not easily
separated, limiting its application in understanding metal–support
interactions.14,23,24

In addition to these surface analysis methods, solid surfaces
can
be studied using mass spectrometry to measure secondary ions, which
are emitted upon collision of accelerated primary ions, typically
Ar+, with the surface.14,25−28 This method is referred to as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
and is useful for elemental analyses of solid surfaces. Dynamic SIMS,
in which SIMS is combined with surface etching, provides the additional
ability to conduct depth profile analyses.26−28 This technique
can be combined with other surface analysis techniques, such as XPS,
and is particularly useful when surface impurities are removed before
analysis under high-vacuum conditions.29,30 Spectroscopic
data obtained in combination with sputtering depth profile techniques
should always be considered carefully because sputtering not only
etches the surface layers but can also cause significant changes in
the surface structure.27,28 Therefore, interpretations of
SIMS and depth-profile analyses are often limited to the qualitative
elemental analyses; interpretations of the atoms’ chemical
environments are considered to be less reliable.

Previously,
confirmation of Au-silicide formation during heat treatment
and establishment of surface etching conditions to analyze the surface
without varying the original structures were discussed.26,34 In the present work, Bi3+ cluster cations
were used as the primary ions of SIMS experiments for probing the
chemical nature of Au nanoparticles supported by a Si wafer substrate.
We anticipated that Bi3+ would etch the surface
more softly than other ion sources (e.g., Ga+, Cs+, Xe+, and Ar+) due to its larger electron
cloud size and polarizability. Therefore, Bi3+-SIMS is expected to provide more valuable information on the surface
structure of the solid with much less deterioration during analysis
compared to the other ion sources-based dynamic SIMS. We combined
the Bi3+-SIMS with Ar1000+ sputtering to etch the surface of Au nanoparticles supported by
a Si wafer. We determined that when Bi3+-SIMS
is coupled with a relatively short Ar1000+ sputtering
time, analyses of the secondary ions, both atomic species and clusters,
can be useful for obtaining information on the local chemical environments
of atoms on the surface. For example, emission of AuSi+ as the secondary ion can be obtained only when Au and Si atoms chemically
interact at part of the periphery of the Au nanoparticles. We highlight
that cluster ion-based SIMS can be useful for obtaining valuable information
on surface structures such as metal–support interaction in
heterogeneous catalysis, which cannot be obtained using other surface
analysis techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Au nanoparticles distributed
on Si wafer surfaces; the three images are from the original sample
and the 100 and 300 °C post-annealed samples under atmospheric
conditions. The Si surface is covered by native SiO2 thin
films. In each image, spherical Au nanoparticles with a mean diameter
of ∼20 nm appear as bright spots, and the individual particles
are separated from each other with a distance of several tens of nanometers.
Structure and size of Au nanoparticles were also confirmed in transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure S2). The light and shade shown in the TEM image are likely due to polyhedral
nature of the Au nanoparticles. SEM images show that neither of the
annealing temperatures yielded significant changes in the shape or
size of the Au particles.

Figure 1 SEM images from (a) as-prepared Au/Si sample,
(b) 100 °C-,
and (c) 300 °C-annealed Au/Si samples, respectively. In each
image, particle-size distribution is shown as inset.

In this study, a SIMS spectrum was obtained for each “cycle”
of the experiment, where a cycle consists of Ar1000+ sputtering for 30 s with an acceleration voltage of 2.5 keV
followed by collection of a SIMS spectrum using Bi3+ as the primary ions. Figure 2 shows a comprehensive SIMS spectrum, which was achieved
by accumulating individual SIMS spectra for the first 30 cycles. In
the m/z range above ∼550,
one can observe multiple peaks separated by the same distance (noted
in the Figure 2), corresponding
to the mass of a single Au atom. The peaks in Figure 2 can be attributed to the Au cluster cations
emitted by the collision of Bi3+ clusters with
the Au/Si surface. Here, one can see the well-known, even-odd pattern,
that is, the Au cluster cations with odd numbers of Au ions in a cluster
are more abundant than even-numbered clusters.26 Cluster emission results from the collective excitation
of Au atoms coordinated with each other within the same Au nanoparticle.31,32 Cluster electronic structure can be explained by a one-electron
shell model, where the valence electronic shells of a cluster are
filled with the 6s Au atom electrons.33 For odd-numbered cluster cations, there are an even number of valence
electrons in a cluster, forming a closed electronic configuration
that makes this cluster highly stable and abundant. On the other hand,
the even-numbered cluster cations leave an unpaired electron in the
outermost valence electronic shell of the cluster, yielding lower
thermodynamic stability and abundance in the SIMS spectra. Not only
the original samples, but also those post-annealed at 100 and 300
°C show this clear even-odd pattern from Au3+ to Au8+ with almost negligibly small amounts
of AumSin+. This implies that most of the Au atoms in a Au nanoparticle
do not form alloys or chemically interact with the substrate’s
Si atoms, even after annealing.

Figure 2 SIMS spectra collected from the surfaces
of (a) as-prepared Au/Si
sample, (b) 100 °C-, and (c) 300 °C-annealed Au/Si samples
using Bi3+ as the primary ion are displayed
in the m/z range between 500 and
1700. See the text for more details about the procedure of collecting
each spectrum.

In Figure 3, the
mass spectra collected together with those in Figure 2 are displayed with the spectra in the lower m/z range magnified. In contrast to the
results shown in Figure 2, differences in the spectra are visible in Figure 3. The many peaks in the lower m/z range are due to collisions of Bi3+ with the surface. This results not only in the emission
of Au and Si, but also C, H, O, and N from organic ligands passivating
the Au nanoparticles and impurities on the wafer surface. A closer
inspection still shows that some peaks are derived from Au and Si.
In the original sample, peaks corresponding to Au+ and
Au2+ can be identified (noted with arrows in Figure 3), with the intensity
of Au+ higher than that of Au2+ due
to the even-odd cluster relationship explained previously. In contrast,
the 100 °C-annealed samples reveal a new peak, which can be attributed
to AuSi+ cluster emission. This peak increases in intensity
when the post-annealing temperature is increased to 300 °C. Some
other peaks in Figure 3 were additionally assigned and are shown in Figure S4.

Figure 3 SIMS spectra collected from (a) as-prepared Au/Si sample,
(b) 100
°C-, and (c) 300 °C-annealed Au/Si samples using Bi3+ as the primary ion are displayed in the m/z range between 100 and 400. These spectra
were collected together with those shown in Figure 2.

To better understand the emission behaviors of Au+,
Au3+, and AuSi+ clusters, changes
in the peak intensity as a function of cycles in our sputtering +
SIMS experiments are shown in Figure 4. For comparison, the intensities of all of the species
are normalized with respect to the total ion intensity of the SIMS
spectrum in each depth analysis cycle. Changes of the respective Si+ peaks are also shown for each sample. Au2+ was not plotted because its intensity was too low in all
SIMS spectra. For the original sample, Au+, Au3+, and Si+ are visible, yet almost no AuSi+ emission is seen for the first 20–30 cycles. Additional
cycles resulted in the gradual increase of AuSi+ peak intensity.
In contrast, for the post-annealed samples, AuSi+, Au+, and Au3+ are seen from the very beginning
of our experiments, with less than 20 cycles of depth profile analysis.

Figure 4 Change
in the intensity of Au+, Au2+, Si+, and AuSi+ signal as a function of number
of sputtering + SIMS cycles collected from the surface of (a) as-prepared
Au/Si sample, (b) 100 °C-, and (c) 300 °C-annealed Au/Si
samples.

In our previous studies, significant
alloying of Au and Si resulted
in the emission of AumSin+ with both m and n values higher than 2 in the Bi3+ primary ion
SIMS spectra.26 In this study, such cluster
cations were rarely seen in the SIMS spectra, implying that significant
alloying of Au and Si did not occur, even after annealing. However,
after annealing, AuSi+ clusters could be found in the SIMS
spectra from the early stage of the depth profile experiments; this
species was barely seen in the original sample for the first 20–30
cycles of the experiment. Cluster emissions result from the collective
excitation of coordinated atoms on the wafer surface by collision
with primary ions. The AuSi+ clusters can be emitted only
when surface Au atoms are coordinated with neighboring Si atoms before
the primary ion collision. Therefore, the results shown in Figures 3 and 4 indicate that there are almost no chemical interactions between
Si and Au atoms in the original samples, but annealing induces formation
of stronger chemical interactions between Au atoms with lower coordination
numbers and neighboring Si atoms (Figure 5). XPS analysis also evidenced formation
of Au-silicide upon annealing but considering its weak intensity,
Au-silicide could have been formed at only a part of the periphery
of Au nanoparticles (Figure S5).

Figure 5 Schematic description
of the structures of Au/Si samples, without
and with post-annealing at 100 or 300 °C.

For better understanding of the formation of chemical bonds between
Au and Si atoms during the annealing process, sputtering + SIMS experiments
were conducted using Au/Si samples annealed at 50 and 75 °C (Figure S3a,b, respectively). At 50 °C, only
a subtle change in the amount of AuSi+ clusters was observed
in comparison to the first 30 cycles for the original sample. However,
when the annealing temperature was increased to 75 °C, an almost
identical amount of AuSi+ clusters were observed as those
from the 100 °C- and 300 °C-annealed samples. A previous
study revealed that Au-silicide could be formed at 25 °C.34 In our samples, Au and Si alloys started to
form at ∼ 50 °C, which is slightly warmer than room temperature,
and at 75 °C, the Au and Si alloy formation at the periphery
of the Au nanoparticles was almost complete.

It is not wholly
understood why all of the samples, both with and
without annealing, showed significantly large amounts of AuSi+ emissions in the SIMS spectra when the number of cycles exceeded
∼100 (Figure 5). The original, non-annealed sample showed almost no AuSi+ cluster emissions for the initial ∼20–30 cycles. However,
AuSi+ cluster emission from the original samples increased
with increasing number of cycles, and for cycles greater than ∼200,
the emission intensity of the original, non-annealed samples is very
similar to the annealed samples in the SIMS spectra. This suggests
that accumulated sputtering time along with an accelerated Au1000+ caused Au-silicide formation in the original
samples. After 1100 cycles, the Au particle size and the texture of
the Si wafer surface was very different from the original structure.
In particular, the repeated sputtering + SIMS experiments resulted
in an agglomeration of Au nanoparticles (Figure 6). This indicates that a large amount of
energy was supplied to the surface during the experiments and was
sufficient for inducing alloy formation from elements that originally
interacted only weakly with their neighbors. Therefore, only SIMS
data collected using very short accumulated sputtering times can be
useful for unveiling the surface structures of solids. The Au1000+ clusters used for etching the surface are
more easily polarized than Ar+, which is widely used for
dynamic SIMS experiments. Therefore, Ar1000+ clusters are expected to sputter the solid surface more softly when
compared to Ar+ ions with a similar acceleration voltage,
although the SIMS data can only be combined with a very short sputtering
time for surface structure analyses.

3 Conclusions
We synthesized Au nanoparticles with a
mean diameter of ∼20
nm. The particles were distributed in the submonolayer of the surface
of a Si wafer covered by native oxide layers. The original and post-annealed
(100 and 300 °C) samples were analyzed using SIMS, with Bi3+ as the primary ions. These measurements were
coupled with Ar1000+ sputtering to etch the
surface layers. One experimental cycle consisted of Ar-cluster sputtering
for 30 s followed by a SIMS experiment, allowing a SIMS spectrum to
be obtained for each cycle. We studied the SIMS spectra of each sample
as a function of the number of cycles. For the original, non-annealed
sample, only Aun+ (n = number of Au atoms) with a well-known even-odd pattern
was observed during lower cycle frequency; no binary clusters of Au
and Si were seen. In the annealed samples, AuSi+ cluster
emissions were observed at similar cycle frequency. This result indicates
that Au atoms form chemical bonds with Si at a part of the periphery
of the Au nanoparticles upon annealing, and such subtle changes in
the surface structure can be monitored using Bi3+-SIMS. Although few techniques (e.g., photoelectron emission microscopy
and TEM) can give similar information, they are limited to well-defined
surface structures, whereas Bi3+-SIMS can be
applied even for much more complex surface structures with less crystallinity.35,36 Using SIMS with cluster ions as the primary particles is a promising
tool for obtaining information about the chemical environment of atoms
on the surface of complex structures. We also showed that SIMS data
obtained together with longer Ar1000+ sputtering
times should be carefully interpreted because lengthy sputtering can
induce structural changes to the solid surfaces.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Au Nanoparticle Synthesis
Gold(III)
chloride hydrate (20 mM, HAuCl4·3H2O, ≥99.9%,
Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution and trisodium citrate (38.8 mM, HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous
solution were used for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles. HAuCl4 solution (20 mM, 5 mL) was mixed with 195 mL of distilled
water (D.W.) in a 250 mL round bottom flask with reflux and heated.
When the solution boiled vigorously, 10 mL of 38.8 mM of trisodium
citrate solution was added. After the sodium citrate solution was
added, the color of the HAuCl4 solution changed from pale
yellow to clear, transparent purple, dark purple, and finally, a red
wine color. The solution continued to boil for additional 20 min to
complete the reaction.

4.2 Au Nanoparticle Deposition
on the Si Wafer
Substrate
A p-doped Si(100) wafer was diced into 5 ×
5 mm pieces and cleaned by sonication in piranha solution (H2SO4 3 mL + H2O2 1 mL) at 90 °C.
After 30 min, the Si wafer pieces were cleaned with D.W. and ethanol
and dried.

The surface of the clean Si wafer was functionalized
with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES, ≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich)
by immersing in APTES solution (APTES 100 μL + anhydrous toluene
10 mL) for 60 min. Finally, the Si wafer was cleaned by sonication
in toluene, washed with fresh toluene, dried, and annealed at 120
°C for 30 min using a furnace.

Au nanoparticles were deposited
on the surface of the APTES-functionalized
Si wafer by immersing the Si wafer in a Au nanoparticle solution for
90 min. Next, the Si wafer was washed with D.W. and dried. The Si
wafers with Au nanoparticles (Au/Si) were annealed at 50, 75, 100,
and 300 °C for 1 h under atmospheric conditions.

4.3 Sample Characterization
The Au-synthesized
nanoparticles were analyzed using TEM (Tecnai G2 Spirit
TWIN, FEI Company). For TEM analysis, a droplet of the Au nanoparticle
solution was dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid (200 mesh, Electron
Microscopy Science), and the surface was analyzed using SEM (S-4800,
Hitachi). Before SEM analysis, the Au/Si sample was annealed at both
100 °C and 300 °C, and the sample surface structure images
were compared with the original Au/Si sample. The surface of the original
Au/Si sample was analyzed before and after the SIMS experiments as
well.

4.4 TOF-SIMS Studies
Time-of-flight SIMS
(TOF-SIMS) experiments were conducted using a TOF-SIMS 5 (ION-TOF
GmbH, Münster, Germany). The instrument was equipped with an
Ar gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) gun and a Bi liquid metal ion gun mounted
orthogonally to each other and 45° to the sample surface (Figure S1). One cycle of the depth profile analysis
was composed with Ar cluster ion sputtering and a subsequent SIMS
analysis; an Ar1000+ cluster with an acceleration
voltage of 2.5 keV and a beam current of 0.97 nA was used for sputtering,
and Bi3+ primary ions with an acceleration voltage
of 30 keV and a beam current of 0.31 pA was used for SIMS analysis.
A 500 × 500 μm area of the sample was sputtered with Ar
GCIB, but only the central 200 × 200 μm area of the sputtered
area of the sample was analyzed with Bi3+ as
the primary ion. Secondary ions were analyzed with TOF-mass spectroscopy
(MS). The mass scale in the SIMS was calibrated using the mass of
H+, CH3+, C2H5+, C3H7+, and C4H9+.
