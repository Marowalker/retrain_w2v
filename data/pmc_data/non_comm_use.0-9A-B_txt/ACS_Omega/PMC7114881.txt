Biobutanol is a promising alternative
fuel for spark-ignition engines. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and
air dilution were evaluated on a TGDI engine fueled with butanol–gasoline
(B20) in view of engine operation, efficiency, gaseous emissions,
and PM emissions. For the B20 engine, EGR affected combustion more
strongly than excess air dilution; the brake thermal efficiency (BTE)
under excess air dilution was much higher than that with EGR. The
oxygen concentration in the cylinder was also markedly reduced with
EGR relative to air dilution, as the partial fresh charge was substituted
with nonreactive gas. A reduced oxygen concentration contributed to
differences in combustion between excess air dilution and EGR. Higher
BTE was observed during combined EGR and excess air dilution operation,
though it was slightly lower than that under excess air dilution alone.
NOx was also markedly reduced by the combination
of EGR and excess air dilution, but was slightly higher than that
with EGR alone. Under combined dilution conditions, the particle number
(PN) emissions from the B20 engine were reduced significantly, particle
sizes decreased, and the nucleate PN significantly decreased.

1 Introduction
The emission and fuel consumption of GDI vehicles have garnered
a great deal of research attention as they have grown increasingly
ubiquitous. GDI technology may significantly improve engine efficiency
and reduce harmful exhaust emissions.1 However,
GDI vehicles fall under increasingly stringent vehicle emission regulations
as they emit more particulate matter (PM) than PFI engines.2,3 Lower carbon emissions than fossil fuels can be achieved with biofuels,
as biofuels are an intermediary in the carbon cycle.4 In addition, the addition of alcohol is generally beneficial
to reduce engine-out regular and PM emissions.5

Butanol is a 4-carbon atomic alcohol and a promising renewable
alternative fuel.6 Butanol can be produced
by biomass fermentation; its production technology is rapidly growing
more sophisticated.7 Compared with ethanol
or methanol, butanol’s combustion characteristics are closer
to that of gasoline. The energy density of butanol is also higher
than that of ethanol.8 The antiknock properties
of butanol are similar to those of gasoline due to their close octane
numbers.9 Butanol has been regarded as
the most promising potential alternative fuel for spark ignition (SI)
engines. According to the US Department of the Energy’s Fuel
and Engine Program, butanol is currently being prepared for mass production
as a second-generation biofuel.10 Butanol
is less corrosive to the fuel supply system, and engine modification
is not required.11 Butanol is miscible
with gasoline, does not absorb water vapor from the air, has low volatility,
and is generally safe.12

According
to the existing research, butanol additives can reduce engine emissions
such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2).13 However, the latent heat of vaporization of butanol is
much higher than that of gasoline (although it is lower than that
of ethanol).14 In addition, the viscosity
of butanol is much higher than that of gasoline, and its saturated
vapor pressure is much lower.15 All of
the above have a negative impact on the evaporation and atomization
of fuel. The hydrogen carbon (HC) emissions also markedly increase
when the proportion of butanol blended with gasoline exceeds 30%.16 Although butanol has a high low calorific value
compared to ethanol or methanol, it is still 23% lower than gasoline
resulting in a penalty of fuel consumption in the butanol or butanol-gasoline
engine. The fuel consumption penalty is one of the obstacles most
hindering the application of butanol-gasoline.17 It is crucial to improve the thermal efficiency of butanol-gasoline
engines before they can be considered practically applicable.

Charge dilution is an effective pathway to improve engine thermal
efficiency. Lean burn (air dilution) technology has been shown to
enhance the efficiency of gasoline engines;18,19 the essence of lean burn is excessive air dilution. The lean burn
reduces particle emissions, improves the fuel economy, and enhances
the engine performance.20 Lean burn also
creates an increase in NOx emissions due
to a reduction in three-way catalyst efficiency resulting in a lower
combustion stability at high air/fuel ratios.21 The effect of lean burn on engine efficiency was investigated on
a 1.4 L GDI engine using the downsizing and turbocharging technology;
the results showed that the lean mixture improved engine fuel consumption.22 Irimescu et al.23 studied cycle-by-cycle variations under lean operation conditions
and reported the effects of operation parameters on the coefficient
of variation (COV) and fuel conversion efficiency in lean mixtures.

There have been many other valuable contributions to the literature.
Park et al.24 explored engine-operating
parameters and engine emissions under lean burn conditions as per
the effect of the excess air ratio on the PM concentration and particle
size distribution. A significant increase in PM emissions upon an
excess air ratio of 1.5 was attributed to the transfer from premixed
flames to stratified mixture flames. At an excess air coefficient
of 2.0, PM and particulate number (PN) emissions again increased significantly.
Zhou et al.25 studied the effects of lean
burn and intake tumble on the engine-operating process. The results
showed that the intake tumble extended the lean burn and allowed for
an acceptable combustion stability. In an optical GDI engine, a lean
mixture increases flame distortion, center movement, and incomplete
combustion during flame front propagation compared to a stoichiometric
mixture. Charge stratification leads to impingement on the chamber
surface and reduces the engine stability.26 However, the efficiency of the three-way catalytic converter in
terms of nitrogen oxidation decreases as the mixture deviates from
stoichiometry.

Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a charge dilution
technique commonly used in diesel engines and gradually more often
applied in gasoline engines which can reduce fuel consumption, reduce
NOx emissions, and suppress knock.27−29 Previous studies have shown that EGR can also reduce PM emissions.30 EGR technology can reduce fuel consumption by
introducing engine exhaust gas into the intake air to form a diluted
mixture. The dilution of the intake charge reduces pumping loss and
heat-transfer loss while the heat capacity of the mixture increases.31 Xie et al.32 studied
the effects of EGR addition on the combustion and emissions of GDI
gasoline engines and compared the effects of hot EGR with cold EGR.
They found that EGR could effectively improve engine brake specific
fuel consumption, reduce NOx emissions,
and reduce PM emissions. The effects of EGR on NOx emissions under stoichiometric mixture were investigated in
another study to find that EGR had a significant effect on NOx emissions at up to a 50% reduction.33 EGR also inhibits abnormal combustion at high intake pressure and
reduces engine fuel consumption by about 7%. Again, EGR technology
not only reduces NOx emissions and improves
engine efficiency but also suppresses knock.34 Fontana and Galloni35 found that EGR
affected the ignition advance angle; the demand for the fuel octane
number under EGR conditions was relatively low, which suggested that
EGR could optimize the ignition advance angle and yielded better engine
efficiency. In a previous study, we explored the effects of EGR on
the performance and particle emissions of GDI engines. We found that
EGR could indeed effectively reduce particle emissions.36 The effect of cold EGR on engine thermal efficiency
is equivalent to an increase in the engine compression ratio from
9.3 to 10.9.37

Combining EGR and
lean burn work may enhance the engine efficiency while reducing NOx emissions, but further research is needed
to confirm this. Previous studies have compared EGR with lean burn
to investigate the combustion, performance, and emissions of the engine
in both modes.38,39 Vancoilie et al.40 investigated the lean-burn and EGR in methanol engines,
the relative efficiency improvements up to 20% were achieved at part
load. Park et al.,41 for example, studied
a combination of EGR and lean burn in a hybrid engine based on H2 and natural gas. The effects of EGR under stoichiometric
mixture and lean mixture conditions were investigated alongside the
effects of dilution rates (DRs) on engine performance and emissions.
The results showed that engine thermal efficiency under EGR was lower
than that under the lean burn mode that hydrocarbon emissions under
the lean burn mode were lower than those under a stoichiometric mixture
and that NOx decreased slightly with increasing
dilution under lean burn conditions.

The effects of EGR compositions
on combustion and NOx emissions were studied
in SI CNG engines and found that CO2 had a more significant
effect on combustion and NOx emissions
than N2.42 Lee et al.43 studied the dilution effects of EGR/lean burn
in low caloric gas engines in terms of their comparative effects on
engine combustion and emissions. The dilution range with EGR was found
to be narrower than that with the lean burn. Under similar operation
conditions, more heat release and a higher peak under lean burn conditions
were obtained as well. The effect of EGR on O2 concentration
is more significant than that of specific heat; lean burn has a more
significant effect on the fuel economy than EGR, and EGR is more effective
in reducing NOx emissions as HC emissions
increase. When the DR is increased to the dilution limit, lean burn
and EGR nearly meet legal emission regulations though efficiency is
slightly reduced.16 Although the individual
effect of EGR and lean burn on combustion and emissions are well-documented,
there has been little research on the effects of combining them. This
information is valuable to researchers, especially in terms of the
combined effects on particle emissions.

Although a few researches
have been carried out in the butanol-gasoline engine under EGR or
lean burn conditions, however, the combination and interactions of
EGR and air dilution on the B20 engine is rarely reported, especially
for PM emissions while two dilution modes operate together. The contribution
of this investigation was to explore combined EGR and air dilution
to improve the fuel economy and emissions of B20 engines. In this
study, we evaluate the combined effects of EGR and lean burn on B20
engine efficiency and emissions. The PM emissions of B20 engine were
investigated and compared under EGR, air dilution and EGR–air
dilution conditions.

2 Experimental Setup and Methodology
2.1 Experimental Setup
The EGR/lean burn experiment was
conducted on a four-cylinder GDI engine fueled with B20. The engine
characteristics are listed in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1, the test bench was composed of an engine, dynamometer,
emission test system, combustion test system, and engine electric
controller. The engine was directly connected to a dynamometer which
controlled the engine speed and load. Coolant temperature, intake
air flow, and other engine operating parameters were collected on
an integrated data acquisition system. The gas emissions were detected
by a gas analyzer (ALV Digi 4000) (Table 2), and the air–fuel ratio was detected
by a lambda meter (ETAS La4) and an oxygen sensor (Bosch LSU 4.9)
mounted in the exhaust pipe. The crankshaft position information was
measured by an angle gauge, and the cylinder pressure was measured
by a cylinder pressure sensor (Kistler 6114B) mounted on the spark
plug. The crankshaft angle signal and cylinder pressure signal were
recorded on a combustion analyzer (DS-0928, Ono). The particulate
emissions were measured with a particulate emission meter (TSI 3090).
The engine exhaust gas was diluted by a two-stage dilution system
and then pumped into the particulate emission meter via the pumping
system. The measurement range of the particulate emission meter was
5.6–560 nm. The measurement frequency was 10 Hz.

2.2 Experimental Methods
The engine was
operated in a speed of 2500 rpm and a load of 25%, which was the typical
working condition in the WLTC cycle. The engine introduced external
cooling EGR to dilute the intake air. The EGR flow rate was adjusted
throughout the test as necessary by a manual valve; the EGR temperature
was not more than 35 °C while the intake temperature was 21 °C.
Base gasoline was purchased from Beijing Petroleum Company (95#).
The addition volume rate of 20% iso-butanol to 80%
gasoline was expressed here as “B20”. The purity of
butanol was up to 99.5% (Table 3). Butanol has a lower low heating value than gasoline. The
fuel injection pulse was increased after butanol addition to maintain
the engine power performance.

The intake CO2 concentration and exhaust CO2 were measured, and the
EGR ratio was calculated as follows32 1  where VCO2(intake) is the volume concentration of
CO2 in the intake air, VCO2(exhaused) is the volume concentration of CO2 in the exhaust
gas, and VCO2(amb) is the volume
concentration of CO2 in the ambient air.

The intake
charge dilution was used as a unanimous dilution level to compare
the effects of EGR and excess air dilution on engine behaviors. The
DRs for EGR and lean burn were defined as follows33 2  where ṁcharge dilution,ṁa,st,ṁf represent the intake mass flow, the mass flow of air
for the stoichiometric mixture, and the mass flow of fuel, respectively.
For EGR dilution, ṁcharge dilution represents EGR mass flow. In the case of a lean mixture, ṁcharge dilution represents the mass
flow of excess air. The DR is the ratio of the mass flow of excess
air to the total inlet flow, which was written as follows33 3  where ṁa,actual represent the mass flow rate of actual inlet
air.

Cylinder pressure data over 250 cycles were collected continuously
on a cylinder pressure sensor, then filtered, and averaged as the
basic data for calculating the cylinder pressure, heat release rate,
and other information. The COV was calculated as follows 4  where σIMEP is the standard deviation of the peak cylinder pressure, and P̅IMEP is the average cylinder pressure
for 200 consecutive cycles.

The brake thermal efficiency (BTE)
of the engine was calculated as 5  where Pbrake is the engine brake power, ṁf is the fuel consumption rate, and LHVfuel is the lower heating value of the fuel.

The particle concentration
and particle size were in this experiment on a Model 3090 (TSI EEPS
System) in the sample exhaust gas per unit volume. The surface area
of the (spherical) particle per unit volume of the exhaust gas was
calculated accordingly. Equation 6 was used to calculate the particulate concentration, and eq 7 was used to calculate
the total particulate concentration. Equation 8 was used to calculate the particulate surface
area concentration, eq 9 to calculate the mean particle size, and eq 10 to calculate the median particle size. 6   7   8   9   10  where c represents particle counts per channel, t is the sample time, Q is the sample flow
rate, Ø is the sample dilution factor, γ
is sample efficiency, Dp is the particle
diameter (channel midpoint), u is the upper channel
boundary, and l is the lower channel boundary.

3 Results and Discussion
In this test, a comparative
evaluation of EGR and air dilution was conducted in an SI engine fueled
with 20% vol butanol blends. The combined effects of EGR and air dilution
on combustion, gaseous emissions, performance, and PM emissions were
assessed and shown in the results.

3.1 Effects of EGR Versus Lean
Burn on Combustion
The oxygen concentrations after dilution
were calculated as shown in Figure 2 to determine the influence of EGR and lean burn modes.
Under lean burn conditions, the air dilution did not change the oxygen
concentration in the cylinder. When EGR was added, the oxygen concentration
in the cylinder decreased rapidly from 21 to 16.4% at a DR of 23.7%.
The oxygen concentration with EGR dilution was significantly lower
than that under lean burn, which can raise the misfire limit due to
excess air dilution.43

Figure 2 . Comparation of oxygen
concentration under EGR and lean burn.

Under an engine speed of 2500 rpm, a brake mean effective pressure
(BMEP) of 4.5 bar, and a ignition time of 20 °CA BTDC, the effects
of excess air dilution on the cylinder pressure of the B20 engine
are as shown in Figure 3. The effect of EGR dilution on the cylinder pressure of the B20
engine is shown in Figure 4. The combustion speed under both dilution operations decelerated,
the phase of the peak cylinder pressure was progressively retarded,
and the peak cylinder pressure decreased gradually as the DR increased.
At a similar DR, EGR dilution caused a more considerable decrease
in the cylinder pressure over air dilution. This was attributable
to the addition of nonreactive gas into the in-cylinder mixture after
EGR introduction resulting in a decrease in burning velocity.43 When the EGR DR was high, the peak cylinder
pressure and the heat release rate decreased significantly; the combustion
phase was markedly delayed and the combustion deteriorated.

Figure 3 Effect of DR
on in-cylinder pressures under excess air dilution.

Figure 4 Effect of DR on in-cylinder pressures under EGR dilution.

The maximum heat release rates of the B20 mixture under the
dilution of EGR and excess air were compared as shown in Figure 5. At low DRs (EGR
DR 6%, excess air DR 7%), the peak heat release rate under lean burn
was higher than that under EGR dilution conditions. The phase corresponding
to the peak heat release rate was unchanged. Under high dilution (17%)
for excess air, the peak value and phase of heat release rate decreased
only slightly. However, under EGR dilution (15%), the peak heat release
rate value decreased substantially and the phase of the heat release
rate was significantly delayed, although fuel oxygenation drove a
strong burn. When EGR was used, the oxygen concentration in the cylinder
decreased. EGR increased the concentration of CO2 and H2O in the cylinder, so the specific heat ratios of the fresh
charge increased and the combustion temperature decreased; the addition
of nonactive gas slowed down the combustion heat release process at
this time as well.44

Figure 5 Impact of excess air
and EGR dilution on maximum heat release rates and phase.

As shown in Figure 6, the COV value increased gradually with increased DR indicating
that the combustion stability of the B20 engine deteriorated. The
COV value under EGR dilution increased faster than that under excess
air dilution. The COV value at EGR 21% was nearly 3%. EGR dilution
resulted in fuel, and O2 being interrupted because of the
increase in the burnt product as CO2 and water vapor markedly
increased.41 Excessive air led to an increase
in the specific heat capacity of the intake charge and a decrease
in the flame temperature. A relatively constant oxygen concentration
had little effect on combustion activation.45

Figure 6 Impact
of excess air and EGR dilution on COV.

As shown in Figure 7, the ignition delay duration (CA0-10) and rapid burning duration
(CA10-90) of B20 increased with increased DR, while the ignition delay
duration and rapid burning duration did not significantly change under
excess air dilution. When EGR was added, CA0-10 and CA0-90 increased
rapidly. EGR appeared to have increased the specific heat capacity
of the intake charge, inhibited the combustion of the mixture, slowed
the combustion chemical reaction process, and reduced the burning
velocity of the mixture in this test. Figure 7 shows that EGR had a more pronounced effect
on flame propagation than the lean burn; the CA0-10 duration with
15% DR of EGR was almost equal to that with 25% DR of excess air.
The rapid burn duration was more affected by EGR than by excess air
because the oxygen content under excess air dilution was higher than
that under EGR dilution. A previous study on natural gas and hydrogen
showed that the effect of EGR on combustion was mainly attributable
to a lower oxygen fraction.46

Figure 7 CA0-10 and
CA10-90 burning duration under excess air and EGR dilution.

For SI engines, the intake air need be throttled
to control the load, which caused a negative intake manifold pressure
in suction strokes, resulting in high pumping losses at light loads.47 The pumping losses of the test engine were calculated
through the pressure curves during intake and exhaust stokes. The
pumping losses are shown in Figure 8 during EGR and air dilution operation. The pumping
losses decreased with increasing dilution ratio. The decrease in pumping
losses under EGR dilution was more pronounced relative to that under
air dilution. The contribution of pumping losses was assessed as PMEP
(0.12 bar)/BMEP (4.5 bar) = 2.6%. During air dilution operation, the
pumping loss decreased about 0.1 bar while the BTE showed an improvement
from 20.6 to 26%, which was an increase of 5.4%. The results showed
pumping loss reduction partly contributed to the BTE improvement during
air dilution. The throttling loss was somewhat smaller for EGR dilution
due to smaller throttling at the same dilution ratio. The reduced
pumping losses contributed to an increased engine efficiency during
dilution operation.

Figure 8 Pumping losses under excess air and EGR dilution.

The combustion efficiency of this test engine is
shown in Figure 9.
There were increased combustion efficiencies during EGR and air dilution.
The increase in combustion efficiency was more pronounced for air
dilution than that under EGR conditions. The combustion efficiency
began to decrease at a high dilution ratio because of degraded burning
such as longer burning duration and reduced burning stability. The
oxygen content under air dilution promoted the oxidation of CO to
CO2. Adding excess oxygen was helpful to more complete
burning and improved the engine theory efficiency (higher ratio of
specific heat κ).48

Figure 9 Combustion efficiency
under excess air and EGR dilution.

3.2 Effects of EGR Versus Lean Burn on Engine Performance
and Emissions
The BTE trends of B20 at a engine speed of
2500 rpm, BMEP of 4.5 bar, and ignition of 20 °CA BTDC are shown
in Figure 10. The
BTE (BTE) of the B20 engine increased from 21 to 27% during excess
air dilution operation. Under the action of EGR, the engine efficiency
did not significantly change; it increased by 1–2% under moderate
EGR dilution. As the DR increased, in order to maintain the engine
power output, the throttle opening was increased to boost the fresh
charge into the cylinder thereby reducing the pumping loss and increasing
the engine efficiency.43 The reduction
in heat-transfer losses to the chamber walls can be attributed to
the reduction in combustion temperature owing to EGR and air dilution.
At a higher EGR DR, increased CO2 and water vapor inhibited
the combustion reaction.28 The combustion
was delayed in this case resulting in low combustion efficiency and
combustion stability leading to a decline in overall engine efficiency.

Figure 10 Impact
of excess air and EGR dilution on brake thermal efficiency.

The effects of EGR and excess air dilution on B20
engine emissions are shown in Figure 11. The NOx emissions from
the stoichiometric mixture with EGR were compared to those under the
lean-burning mode. NOx emissions were
almost linearly suppressed as the EGR DR increased. The addition of
EGR caused an increase in triatomic gas, which increased the intake
charge specific heat and decreased the oxygen concentration, driving
down the combustion temperature. High temperature and enriched oxygen
were important predicators of NOx production.49 As expected, the NOx emissions decreased slightly as the excess air rate increased due
to a decrease in combustion temperature under lean burn conditions.

Figure 11 Impact
of EGR and excess air dilution on emissions.

As shown in Figure 11, HC emissions from the B20 engine gradually decreased as the air
DR increased, and the effect of the lean mixture on the reduction
of emitted HC grew more obvious. The increased oxygen content was
beneficial for the oxidation of hydrocarbons.43 At a low EGR rate, HC emissions increased slightly. At a high EGR
rate, HC emissions increased by up to about 20% due to the lower combustion
temperature at high EGR resulting in poor evaporation of the wall
fuel film.

3.3 Combined Effects of EGR
and Lean Burn on Combustion, Performance, and Emissions
The
combustion and performance of the B20 engine at a speed of 2500 rpm
and a BMEP of 4.5 bar are shown in Figure 12 under EGR dilution, excess air dilution,
and a combination of EGR and excess air conditions, where the EGR
rate was 20%, excess air rate was 1.3, and combined dilution was EGR
15%/excess air 1.2. The DRs under all three operation conditions were
almost equivalent. Among them, EGR showed the most significant effect
on COV while excess air had the lowest COV value. The COV value under
combined dilution was similar to that under solely excess air. The
combustion stability under combined dilution was better than that
under EGR dilution.

Figure 12 Effects of combined EGR and excess air dilution on combustion
and performance.

Under EGR dilution conditions,
the combustion parameters CA0-10 and CA10-90 had the longest durations.
Under the combined dilution of EGR and excess air, the combustion
parameters CA0-10 and CA10-90 were similar to those under excess air
dilution alone. The effect of combined dilution on the combustion
speed was higher than that under EGR alone. Under all three operation
conditions, the differences in the combustion behavior were also reflected
in the fuel consumption rate. As shown in Figure 12, the fuel consumption rate under EGR dilution
was the highest—which represented a benchmark for fuel savings—and
the fuel consumption under excess air dilution was the lowest at up
to 24.2%. Under combined dilution conditions, the fuel economy significantly
increased to about 21.6% compared to that under EGR dilution conditions.

As shown in Figure 13, EGR markedly reduced NOx emissions.
There was a more significant reduction in NOx emissions with combined dilution than under air dilution alone.
Under the combined dilution, the excess air rate and exhaust gas flow
were reduced because of the excess air dilution so that the NOx emissions concentration and exhaust gas
decreased. HC and CO emissions were lower under lean burn and combined
dilution conditions compared to those under EGR alone. EGR drove down
the combustion temperature, worsens the evaporation of the fuel film
on the wall, and increased the cycle variation; in our experiment,
as expected; this caused an increase in HC emissions. Conversely,
the oxygen in the cylinder was sufficient under lean burn conditions.
This benefited the conversion of CO to CO2 resulting in
a significant reduction of CO emissions.

Figure 13 Effects of combined
EGR and excess air dilution on emissions.

3.4 Combined Effects of EGR and Lean Burn on PM Emissions
We next measured PN values to evaluate the effects of combined
dilution on PM emissions from the B20 engine. The results are shown
in Figures 14 and 15. There was lower PN in the nuclear mode (<20
nm) under combined dilution conditions than that under air dilution
alone. The PN in the agglomerated mode (>20 nm) under combined
dilution was lower than that under sole EGR dilution. For premixed
combustion, H-abstraction occurs at a high burn temperature, and particulates
are formed.24,31 A lean burn inhibited the H-abstraction
reaction due to the lower combustion temperature.50 Sufficient air and longer flame development together improved
the mixture and reduced local rich phenomena.51

Figure 14 PN concentration under EGR and excess air dilution.

Figure 15 Particle surface area concentration under EGR and excess air dilution.

The effect of EGR on particulate emissions was
obvious in this experiment. When rgw EGR rate was 23%, the PN decreased
considerably as did the concentration of nuclear particulates, while
the concentration of agglomerated particulates slightly increased.
When EGR and excess air dilution were combined, the PN was lower than
that under excess air dilution alone but higher than that under EGR
alone. The peak values of the particle surface area (PSA) concentration
under combined dilution were similar to those under EGR and lean burn,
respectively, but the particle size corresponding to the PSA concentration
under combined dilution was smaller than that under EGR alone and
larger than that under excess air dilution alone. EGR reduced the
oxygen concentration in the cylinder resulting in a higher specific
heat capacity in the intake charge and a decrease in the combustion
temperature. A low combustion temperature inhibited primary carbonaceous
particulates because of the reduced thermal pyrolysis and the H-abstraction
reaction resulting in a significant decrease in the PN concentration.52

As shown in Figure 16, the median particle size under EGR dilution
was 26.8 nm, the median particle size under the combined dilution
was 20.2 nm, and the median particle size under lean burn was 13.6
nm (the smallest of the three dilution modes). The distribution of
nuclear and agglomerated particulates is shown in Figure 17. With EGR addition, the concentration
of nuclear and agglomerated particulates significantly decreased.
Under combined dilution, the concentration of agglomerated PM increased,
but the concentration of nuclear particulates was the lowest among
all the modes we tested.

4 Conclusions
The
combustion, regulated emissions, and particle emissions of a B20 engine
were investigated in this study. The charge dilutions of air dilution,
EGR dilution and a combination of both dilution modes were investigated
in the B20 SI engine. The results can be summarized as follows.1 The effect
of EGR addition on the combustion behavior was more significant than
that under excess air dilution. The burning duration increased significantly,
and the COV increased to 3% limit at the EGR DR of 21% while the COV
limit (3%) was exceeded at excess air DR of 28%. Air dilution improved
BTE up to 26.7% at a DR of 20%. EGR showed less influence on the thermal
efficiency compared to excess air dilution. A decrease in efficiency
was observed as the EGR DR exceeded 20%.

2 Under a combination of EGR and air dilution, the
combustion behaviors and thermal efficiencies were similar to those
under excess air dilution alone; higher thermal efficiency was observed
and the combustion stability was better than that under EGR alone.
Under combined dilution conditions, the NOx emissions were significantly reduced—to a similar extent
as under EGR alone.

3 When
EGR and excess air worked together in this test, the PN emissions
from B20 were as low as those under solely air dilution. The PSA concentration
was similar to that of EGR alone, that is, lower than that under air
dilution alone. The particle sizes decreased significantly and the
concentration of nucleate particles were markedly reduced under combined
dilution conditions.



Future work will
investigate the performance of B20 engines at cold start and idle
conditions. The HC and PM emissions from the cold start stage need
to be studied in SI engines. The irregular emissions will be investigated
with B20 to assess the potential harmful emissions.
