A novel MoS2–DOPO hybrid has been successfully synthesized through the
grafting of 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO)
on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets using allyl mercaptan
as an intermediate. MoS2–DOPO was used as a flame
retardant additive to prepare flame-retardant flexible polyurethane
foam (FPUF). The influence of MoS2–DOPO on the mechanical,
thermal stability, and flame retardancy properties of FPUF composites
were systematically investigated. The incorporation of MoS2–DOPO could not deteriorate greatly the tensile strength and
50% compression set of FPUF composites, but effectively improves the
char residue. The cone calorimeter and smoke density tests results
revealed that the peak heat release rate, total heat release, and
the maximum smoke density of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
composite were reduced by 41.3, 27.7, and 40.5%, respectively, compared
with those of pure FPUF. Furthermore, the char residue after cone
calorimeter tests and pyrolysis gaseous products of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric
analysis/infrared spectrometry. The results suggested that the MoS2–DOPO hybrid played a synergistic flame retardant effect
of gas and condensed bi-phase action. In addition, a possible flame
retardancy and smoke suppression mechanism of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
composite were proposed. This study provides a facile and promising
strategy for the fabrication of polymer materials with excellent flame
retardancy and smoke suppression properties.

==== Body
Introduction
Polyurethane is a type of polymeric material
containing many repetitive urethane groups in its chain structure,
which is generally produced by the reaction of isocyanates and polyols.1 Flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) is one of the
main varieties of polyurethane materials, and widely used in vehicles,
furniture, and cushions because of its vibration insulation, high
resilience, low density, and good mechanical properties.2,3 Unfortunately, FPUF is highly flammable because of its large specific
surface area and open-cell structure. Meanwhile, a large amount of
heat, smoke, and toxic gas products is generated during the thermal
degradation and combustion process,4 which
greatly affects the escape and rescue of trapped humans. Consequently,
in recent years, various methods for enhancing the flame retardancy
of FPUF have been explored to meet its practical demands.5−7 Among them, the incorporation of flame retardants has been considered
to be an effective strategy to enhance its fire safety properties.

Generally, halogenated, metal hydroxides and phosphorus flame retardants
are usually used to achieve good flame retardancy. Halogenated flame
retardants exhibit superior flame retardancy for FPUF. However, a
massive amount of corrosive and toxic volatile compounds are released
from halogenated flame retardants, which could do great harm to the
ecological environment and human health.8,9 Thus, many
researchers have been devoted to develop environment-friendly halogen-free
flame retardants to reduce environmental problems and potential negative
health effects,10 especially phosphorus-containing
and metal hydroxide flame retardants. Previous studies have revealed
that metal hydroxides, such as aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide,
have obvious advantages in thermal stability, nontoxic, and smoke
suppression properties.11 However, the
high addition of metal hydroxides is needed to achieve satisfactory
flame retardant efficiency, which usually damages the mechanical performance
of the polymers.2,12 Recently, layer-by-layer assembly
and sol–gel techniques have attracted increasing attention
in the flame-retardant treatment of FPUFs because of their high efficiency
and environmentally friendly nature,13,14 but they usually
exhibit poor durability under the influence of the physical damages,
washing, and chemical etching.15

MoS2 is one of layered transition-metal dichalcogenides
and composed of a three-layer sandwich structure (S–Mo–S)
formed by van der Waals forces.16 The bulk
MoS2 can be peeled off into nanosheets by destroying the
weak van der Waals interactions. MoS2 nanosheets are expected
as a promising filler to improve the flame retardancy of polymer matrices
because of its excellent barrier effect, lower thermal conductivity,
and smoke suppression properties.17 In
recent years, MoS2 nanosheets has been studied to enhance
flame retardant properties of many polymers, such as polyurethane,18 polyethylene,19 and
polypropylene.20 However, the exfoliated
MoS2 nanosheets cannot disperse well in polymer matrices
because of its high specific surface area and van der Waals interactions,21 which could seriously affect its flame-retardant
efficiency. Previous reports have shown that the dispersibility and
flame-retardant efficiency of MoS2 nanosheets can be obviously
improved by surface modification with metal oxide,19 layered double hydroxide,22 POSS,23 and graphene.24 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide
(DOPO) plays an obvious flame-retardant role in the gas phase and
condensed phase simultaneously.25 Some
studies have showed that the flame retardancy of polymer matrices
has been greatly improved using DOPO grafted onto SiO2 nanoparticles,26 graphene oxide,27 and POSS.28 As reported by the many previous
literatures, some novel hybrid flame retardants show satisfactory
flame-retardant efficiency.29−31 Qian et al.29 prepared flame-retardant polypropylene composites with
a novel organic–inorganic hybrid char-forming agent (SCTCFA-ZnO),
and the hybrid compounds showed high-efficiency flame retardancy and
smoke suppression performance. Therefore, it is promising to obtain
flame-retardant synergistic effect of MoS2 nanosheets and
DOPO by grafting MoS2 nanosheets with DOPO.

In this
work, we develop a novel strategy to design the DOPO-functionalized
MoS2 nanosheets. Generally, it is difficult to realize
the one-step grafting of DOPO onto MoS2 nanosheets because
of the lack of functional groups on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. The previous works have revealed the formation of chemical
bonds between thiol molecules and the defects of unsaturated Mo edges
or S vacancies in MoS2 nanosheets.32,33 To obtain MoS2 nanosheets with more defects, MoS2 powders is exfoliated by the ultrasonication-assisted method
in a N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP)/H2O2 mixed solvent. Allyl mercaptan (AM) is innovatively
selected for the preliminary modification of MoS2 nanosheets,
and stably attached on the surface of MoS2 through covalent
interaction. Then, the addition reaction between −C=C
groups of AM and P–H bonds of DOPO molecules happens using
a solvothermal method, and the DOPO group-functionalized MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2–DOPO) hybrid is obtained. The
synthesis route of the MoS2–DOPO hybrid is illustrated
in the Scheme 1. Subsequently,
the MoS2–DOPO hybrid is introduced into the FPUF
matrix to reduce its fire hazards, and the formations of pure and
flame-retardant FPUF composites are listed in Table 1. The introduced DOPO organic molecules could
improve the dispersibility of MoS2 nanosheets in the FPUF
matrix. The microstructure, thermal stability, and flame-retardant
properties of FPUFs are investigated by a scanning electron microscope,
thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and cone calorimeter tests. The char
residue after cone calorimeter tests and pyrolysis products of MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite has also been investigated. Moreover,
a possible flame retardancy and smoke suppression mechanism of MoS2–DOPO in the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite
is explored.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the MoS2–DOPO
Hybrid
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to estimate
the thickness of MoS2 nanosheets and the data are displayed
in Figure 1. As shown
in Figure 1a, the two-dimensional
MoS2 nanosheets have the lateral size of several hundred
nanometers. Figure 1b presents the corresponding height profile of the AFM image, and
the thickness of the MoS2 nanosheets is about 4.43 nm.
Previous reports have shown that the thickness of an exfoliated MoS2 monolayer is about 1.0 nm,34,35 so the prepared
MoS2 nanosheets comprises only 3–5 layers of the
MoS2 monolayer, suggesting the successful exfoliation of
bulk MoS2 into few-layer nanosheets.

Figure 1 (a) AFM image and (b)
corresponding height profile of MoS2 nanosheets.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the
MoS2 nanosheets, MoS2–AM, DOPO, and MoS2–DOPO are displayed in Figure 2. In the FTIR spectrum of MoS2 nanosheets, the absorption peaks at 1623 cm–1 belong
to the characteristic O–H bending vibration band of the adsorbed
water on the MoS2 nanosheets.36 In addition, the peak at about 469 cm–1 is assigned
to Mo–S stretching vibration.37 In
comparison with the FTIR spectrum of MoS2 nanosheets, new
absorption peaks at 728 and 671 cm–1 can be emerged
in the spectrum of MoS2–AM, which are derived from
the C–S bond,38 and the band at
1642 cm–1 is derived from CH=CH2 stretching vibration.39 This indicates
that AM is grafted onto the surface of MoS2 nanosheets.
These peaks at 1449, 1226, and 754 cm–1 are assigned
to the P–Ph, P=O, and P–O–Ph stretching
vibration, respectively.40 Moreover, the
disappearance of P–H stretching vibration (2362 cm–1) and CH=CH2 stretching vibration (1642 cm–1) suggests the occurrence of the addition reaction
between MoS2–AM and DOPO. The FTIR results confirm
the successful grafting of DOPO onto MoS2 nanosheets through
the addition reaction of the P–H group with the CH=CH2 group using AM as an intermediate.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were used for
investigating the morphologies of the MoS2 nanosheets and
MoS2–DOPO and the corresponding results are exhibited
in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the TEM images
of MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2–DOPO, and
the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum of MoS2–DOPO, respectively. It can be clearly seen from Figure 3a that MoS2 nanosheets exhibit a typical sheet-like morphology and uniform and
smooth surfaces. As shown in Figure 3b, a lattice distance of 0.27 nm is consistent with
the space of the (100) lattice plane hexagonal MoS2.41 Composed with MoS2 nanosheets, MoS2–DOPO has a much rougher surface (Figure 3c), and some pellet-like DOPO
nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 15–20 nm are
distributed randomly on the surfaces of MoS2 nanosheets,
indicating that DOPO molecules are successfully covalently attached
on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. According to a previous
literature, the MoS2 nanosheets modified with organic components
show better dispersibility and compatibility in the polymer matrix,
which contributes to the improvement of flame-retardant efficiency.42,43 Therefore, with the aid of DOPO molecules, the dispersibility and
compatibility of MoS2–DOPO in the FPUF matrix may
be improved. In addition, the elemental compositions of MoS2–DOPO were also examined by EDX spectroscopy and the results
are shown Figure 3d.
The elements Mo, S, C, O, and P are detected in the EDX spectrum.
This result also implies that DOPO molecules are successfully grafted
onto the surfaces of MoS2 nanosheets.

spectrum of MoS2–DOPO.

Morphology Analysis
Generally, the morphologies of FPUFs
are mainly their cellular structure. The cellular structures of pure
FPUF and flame-retardant FPUFs were investigated by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analysis and the SEM micrographs are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen
from Figure 4a,b that
pure FPUF displays a smooth surface and porous network with the cellular
size of about several hundred micrometers. However, the cellular size
of MoS2/FPUF is obviously increased compared with that
of pure FPUF (Figure 4c). Moreover, many agglomerated MoS2 nanosheets can be
also observed on the surface of FPUF from Figure 4d. From Figure 4e,f, the cellular structures of DOPO/FPUF
tend to collapse, which is due to the fact that DOPO would damage
the cellular structure by affecting the bubble nucleation and bubble
growth in the foaming process.44 In contrast,
it can be observed from Figure 4g that MoS2–DOPO/FPUF exhibited similar
cellular structures and cell size to pure FPUF, and hardly had any
cracks, suggesting that the good incompatibility between the MoS2–DOPO particles and the FPUF matrix. In addition, it
can be seen from Figure 4h that the MoS2–DOPO nanoparticles are uniformly
distributed in the FPUF matrix, suggesting a better dispersion in
the FPUF matrix and stronger interfacial interaction with the matrix
than MoS2 nanosheets. This result is consistent with the
aforementioned TEM analysis.

pure FPUF, (c,d) MoS2/FPUF, (e,f) DOPO/FPUF, and (g,h)
MoS2–DOPO/FPUF.

Physical and Mechanical Properties
As shown in Table 2, the densities of
pure and flame-retardant FPUFs are in the range of 26–28 kg/m2, which are in the density range of FPUFs.45 The densities of FPUFs increase slightly with the addition
of MoS2, DOPO, and MoS2–DOPO. The mechanical
properties of FPUF are mainly determined by their composition and
cellular structures.46Table 2 also shows their tensile strength,
elongation at break, and 50% compression set. When MoS2 nanosheets (6 wt %) are added, the tensile strength and the elongation
at the break of MoS2/FPUF decrease compared with those
of the pure FPUF, and it can be ascribed to that MoS2 nanosheets
leads to deterioration of the cellular structures and further results
in the decrease of tensile strength and elongation at the break. In
particular, the tensile strength of DOPO/FPUF is small higher than
that of pure and other flame-retardant FPUFs, which should be attributed
to the nucleophilic addition reaction between DOPO and toluene diisocynate
(TDI). The incorporation of DOPO slightly deteriorates the elongation
at the break and 50% compression set of FPUF. Unsurprisingly, compared
with MoS2/FPUF and DOPO/FPUF, MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
has relatively moderate mechanical properties. The tensile strength
and elongation at the break were 78 kPa and 124%, respectively. The
deterioration of the 50% compression set may be ascribed to that MoS2–DOPO increased the stiffness of FPUF. These results
show that the incorporation of MoS2–DOPO could not
greatly reduce the mechanical properties of FPUF.

Thermal Stability
Properties
TG analysis was employed to assess the thermal
stability and char-forming ability of pure and flame-retardant FPUFs.
TG and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of pure and flame-retardant
FPUFs under a N2 atmosphere are shown in Figure 5, and the correlative data
are summarized in Table 3. It is observed in Figure 5a,b that all the FPUFs present similar two decomposition stages,
and there are two DTG peaks between 220 and 470 °C.47 In the first stage, many volatile gases are
released because of the breaking of the bonds between TDI-derived
moieties.48 The second stage is ascribed
to the degradation of the soft segments.49

and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF.

and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF

pure FPUF	255	284	381	0.3	
MoS2/FPUF	249	276	372	5.9	
DOPO/FPUF	250	279	378	9.3	
MoS2–DOPO/FPUF	254	281	380	12.0	
For pure FPUF, the
initial degradation temperature (T5%)
was at 255 °C, while the first maximum weight loss temperature
(Tmax1) and the second maximum weight
loss temperature (Tmax2) are at 284 and
381 °C, respectively. In comparison with pure FPUF, the T5%, Tmax1 and Tmax2 of the flame-retardant FPUFs decrease slightly,
especially for the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite. Moreover,
the char residue at 700 °C was only 0.3 wt % for pure FPUF. The
incorporation of MoS2 or DOPO could improve the charring
ability of the flame-retardant FPUFs at high temperature, and the
corresponding residues at 700 °C for MoS2/FPUF and
DOPO/FPUF were 5.9 and 9.3%, respectively. This phenomenon may be
attributed to MoS2 and DOPO which act as catalysts to promote
char formation during degradation.50,51 On the contrary,
MoS2–DOPO/FPUF has a higher char residue value,
up to 12.0%, indicating a synergistic effect between MoS2 nanosheets and DOPO. These char residues can act as a thermal isolated
physical barrier to prevent the transfer of heat, oxygen, and flammable
gases, which enhances the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of
FPUF.52 These results demonstrate that
MoS2–DOPO can significantly improve the thermal
stability and char residue of FPUF.

Flame Retardancy Analysis
Cone calorimetry measurements were conducted to investigate the
flammability of pure and flame-retardant FPUFs. A heat flux of 35
kW/m2 is usual for testing FPUFs because the foams with
the open-cell structure cannot withstand a high heat flux.53 The cone calorimeter gives quantitative analysis
to their flammability by investigating several important parameters,
such as time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR), total heat
release (THR), average effective heat of combustion (Av-EHC), smoke
production rate (SPR), and CO production rate.54Figure 6 gives the HRR, THR, SPR, and CO production rate curves of pure FPUF,
MoS2/FPUF, DOPO/FPUF, and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
samples. The corresponding cone calorimetry data are illustrated in Table 4.

SPR, and (d) CO production rate curves for pure and flame-retardant
FPUFs.

pure FPUF	17.3	5	356	21.3	32.8	0.098	5.93	0.74	3.2	
MoS2/FPUF	21.6	5	248	19.2	31.2	0.062	4.79	0.58	9.3	
DOPO/FPUF	23.2	5	279	16.1	26.4	0.121	6.28	0.59	11.5	
MoS2–DOPO/FPUF	23.9	7	209	15.4	26.7	0.065	4.42	0.47	15.6	
From Figure 6a, it has been demonstrated
that pure FPUF displays a rapid heat release, and a high peak HRR
(pHRR) value of 356 kW/m2 is achieved at 35 s. The addition
of the flame retardant decreases significantly the pHRR value and
increase the time to pHRR of the FPUF samples. Specifically, the pHRR
of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite is reduced to 209
kW/m2 (41.3% reduction), and the time to pHRR is prolonged
by 20 s. As shown in Figure 6b, all the FPUFs display very low TTI (≤7 s) because
of their open cellular structure. The pure FPUF releases heat very
quickly after ignition and the THR value reaches 21.3 MJ/m2 at the end of the combustion process. The THR value of MoS2/FPUF and DOPO/FPUF composites drop to 19.2 and 16.1 MJ/m2, respectively, much lower than that of pure FPUF. It is worth noting
that the THR value of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite
is remarkably reduced to 15.4 MJ/m2, with a decrease of
27.7% compared with that of pure FPUF, which indicates that the flame
spread slows down and the fire heat hazards reduce. The obtained THR
reduction is higher than those previously reported values of 17.7%
for FPUF containing 10 php additive flame-retardant55 and 17.4% for FPUF containing 6.3 wt % inherent flame-retardant.56 As depicted in Table 4, the addition of DOPO and MoS2–DOPO brings about an obvious reduction in the Av-EHC values
of FPUF composites, suggesting the lower heat released from the volatile
thermal decomposition products. The lower Av-EHC values meant that
the gaseous-phase flame retardant effects of DOPO and MoS2–DOPO in DOPO/FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composites.57

Smoke Suppression Property
SPR and
total smoke production (TSP) are considered to be important parameters
to evaluate smoke hazards. The lower peak of SPR (pSPR) and TSP suggests
lower smoke hazards and longer escape times for humans in a fire.58 As seen in Figure 6c and Table 4, the incorporation of MoS2 and MoS2–DOPO would obviously reduce the pSPR and TSP values
of FPUFs. However, the addition of DOPO leads to an increase in the
pSPR and TSP values, probably due to less complete combustion of the
DOPO/FPUF composite. Compared with pure FPUF, the pSPR and TSP values
of the MoS2/FPUF composite are decreased by 36.7 and 19.2%,
respectively. In addition, the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite
has great reductions of pSPR (33.7%) and TSP (25.5%), which exhibits
superior smoke suppression efficiency of MoS2–DOPO.
Furthermore, the time for pSPR for MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
(55 s) displays a great delay as compared to that for pure FPUF (35
s) and MoS2/FPUF (40 s). The smoke suppression properties
are probably ascribed to the physical barrier effect of a compact
char layer for reducing the volatilized pyrolysis products release
during the combustion.

Besides the heat and smoke hazards, the
toxicity of the generated gases in a fire is an important factor affecting
the survival and escape of humans. Figure 6d shows the CO production rate curves of
the pure and flame-retardant FPUFs and the related cone calorimetry
data are summarized in Table 4. MoS2–DOPO/FPUF displays a significant
reduction in the CO production rate compared with the pure FPUF and
MoS2/FPUF. The total CO production values of MoS2/FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF are as low as 0.58 and
0.47 g, respectively, decreased by 21.6 and 36.5% of those of pure
FPUF. Hence, the reduction in total CO production is tremendously
helpful for reducing the risk of asphyxiation during the evacuation
and rescue process.

The smoke density test is another effective
method to investigate the smoke suppression properties of polymer
materials.59 The maximum smoke density
is an important parameter to estimate the smoke suppression ability
of flame retardants. Generally, the lower the maximum smoke density
is, the better for evacuation and fire extinguishing in a fire.60Figure 7 gives the smoke density curves of pure and flame-retardant
FPUFs. Pure FPUF can easily produce a lot of black and toxic smoke
during combustion. The smoke density quickly increases in the first
150 s, tends to be stable after 200 s, and its maximum value reaches
to 390. However, the smoke density of DOPO/FPUF shows an initially
faster increase trend than that of pure FPUF, attains the maximum
value (394) at 350 s, and then there is a slow decrease. DOPO plays
a role of the flame retardant in the gas phase by capturing free radicals
at the early stage of combustion, resulting in an increase of smoke
density. Because it also could promote the char formation in the condensed
phase, the char residue layer may reduce the smoke production at a
later stage of combustion. For the MoS2/FPUF composite,
it can be observed that the smoke density is lower than that of pure
FPUF, and gets a maximum smoke density of 264 at 250 s, indicating
that MoS2 nanosheets have an obvious smoke suppression
effect. Compared with the MoS2/FPUF composite, the maximum
smoke density of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite is
further decreased to 232 at 300 s, which is significantly reduced
by 40.5% as compared with that of pure FPUF. The smoke density results
further confirm that there may exist a synergistic effect of smoke
suppression between MoS2 nanosheets and DOPO in the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite.

FPUFs.

Char Residue Analysis after
Cone Calorimeter Tests
In order to study the effects of flame-retardant
additives on the char formation of flame-retardant FPUFs, the morphologies
of the char residues after cone calorimetric tests were investigated
by SEM analysis. Figure 8 presents the photographs and SEM images of the char residue for
the pure and flame-retardant FPUFs after cone calorimeter tests. As
shown in Figure 8a,b,
there is almost no residual char left in the pure FPUF, and a very
small amount of the residual char exhibits an obvious broken structure
with abundant cracks and holes, which cannot effectively prevent the
inner matrix from further combustion.61 These cracks and holes result from the emission of the volatile
gas during thermal decomposition and combustion.62 As for MoS2/FPUF (Figure 8c,d), the charred layers has a uniform and
compact surface, but a few small holes and flaws are also observed
on its surface, suggesting the fragile structure of the char residue
caused by inhomogeneous dispersion of MoS2 nanosheets.
As a comparison, a more compact and intact char layer is formed for
DOPO/FPUF (Figure 8e,f). In addition, from Figure 8g,h, it is seen that the charred layer becomes more
continuous and integrated by the incorporation of MoS2–DOPO
into FPUF, indicating a good synergistic effect of MoS2 nanosheets and DOPO during the char formation process. This continuous
and compact char layer can effectively prevent the emission of combustible
volatiles and heat feedback from the flame, resulting in the inhibition
on its combustion.63

(e,f) DOPO/FPUF, and (g,h) MoS2–DOPO/FPUF after
cone calorimeter tests.

EDX analysis was carried
out to investigate the elemental composition of char residues, and
the EDX spectra of the residual char for pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF after cone tests are presented in Figure 9. In the Figure 9a, the main compositions of the residual
char are C and O elements for the pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF.
In addition, there are Mo (2.31 at. %) and S (0.73 at. %) signals
in the char residues of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite
(Figure 9b), indicating
that some MoS2 nanosheets are oxidized to MoO3 during combustion.64 MoS2 nanosheets
are very helpful to the improvement of smoke suppression and catalytic
oxidation of CO,65 leading to the reduction
in the release of harmful smoke and CO. The existence of MoO3 in the char residues could further enhance the thermal oxidation
resistance of the char residue effectively. Moreover, 1.13 at. % of
the P element is also detected in the char layers because of the formation
of phosphorus-containing compounds.66

of the residual char for: (a) pure FPUF and (b) MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
composite after cone calorimeter tests.

The char residues of pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
composites after cone calorimeter tests were surveyed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis. As presented in Figure 10a, the XRD pattern of pure FPUF displays
a broad band centered at approximately 23°, which is ascribed
to the (002) diffraction peak of graphite.67 For the XRD pattern of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite
(Figure 10b), a broad
and weak band at around 23° reveals the formation of graphitized
carbon. Besides, the sharp peaks at 12.6, 32.8, 33.8, 39.1, 46.3,
49.3, and 52.7° are attributed to the (020), (101), (111), (060),
(210), (002), and (211) diffraction peaks of MoO3,68 which is probably due to the oxidation of MoS2 nanosheets with the presence of oxygen and oxygen-containing
pyrolysis products.67 This is consistent
with the many crystal particles observed on the char residue of the
MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite. Hence, MoS2 nanosheets not only serve as an effective barrier to inhibit oxygen
and heat transfer between the gas phase and condensed phase, and the
release of combustible gases from the underlying materials during
thermal decomposition and combustion, but also can be oxidized to
MoO3 that can effectively suppress the generation of smoke
particles.69

composite after cone calorimeter tests.

Gaseous Products Analysis by TG Analysis/IR Spectrometry Measurements
TG analysis/IR spectrometry technique was usually used to study
the volatilized pyrolysis products in the gaseous phase during the
thermal decomposition process of flame-retardant FPUFs, which provides
a new method for further study of the flame retardant mechanism.70Figure 11 shows the FTIR spectra of the pyrolysis products evolved
from pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF at T5%, Tmax1, and Tmax2. As shown in Figure 11a, at T5% and Tmax1, the band at 2314 and 2351 cm–1 are attributed to the vibration absorption −NCO groups and
CO2, respectively. This is probably due to the degradation
of urethane groups (−NHCOO−) in the polyurethane chains
during the heating process. However, it can be seen from Figure 11b that MoS2–DOPO/FPUF also releases many compounds containing
P=O groups (1238 cm–1) at the T5% (254 °C) and Tmax1 (281 °C), indicating the cleavage of P–C bonds and the
formation of PO• radicals.71 The PO• radicals can act as free-radical scavengers
to capture the H• and OH• radicals
in the gaseous phase during the combustion process.72 When the temperature increased to Tmax2, pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF show the
same absorption peaks at around 3600, 2900, 2350, 1730, 1610, 1460,
and 1100 cm–1, corresponding to the characteristic
absorption of water, C–H groups in saturated hydrocarbons,
carbon dioxide, carbonyl, aromatic compounds, amide, and C–O
groups, respectively.73 This suggests that
the urethane groups are further decomposed into macromolecular scission
products.

Figure 11 FTIR spectra of the volatilized pyrolysis products emitted from
(a) pure FPUF and (b) MoS2–DOPO/FPUF at T5%, Tmax1, and Tmax2 during TG-IR measurements.

Furthermore, the TG-IR technique was also carried out to
investigate the smoke suppression effect of the MoS2–DOPO
hybrid on reducing volatilized pyrolysis products. Figure 12a–d displays the absorbance
intensity of volatilized pyrolysis products for pure FPUF and MoS2–DOPO/FPUF versus temperature, including total, hydrocarbons
(2980 cm–1), aromatic compounds (1610 cm–1), and amide (1460 cm–1). As can be seen, the absorbance
intensities of pyrolysis products evolved from MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
are significantly lower than that for pure FPUF, especially aromatic
compounds and amide compounds. Because the pyrolysis molecules would
further condense and aggregate to form smoke particles, the reduction
of these pyrolysis products could lead to the suppression of smoke.
This is consistent with the results of the reduction of smoke production
in the cone calorimetric tests.

Probable Flame Retardancy and Smoke Suppression
Mechanism
Based on the above analysis, a possible flame-retardant
mechanism of MoS2–DOPO in the FPUF composite is
proposed, and displayed in Figure 13. During the thermal decomposition and combustion process,
FPUF liberates a variety of volatilized pyrolysis products, such as
hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, amide, and so on. These pyrolysis
products can react with the surrounding oxygen and releases a large
amount of heat. Meanwhile, hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds tend
to aggregate into small smoke particles, which increase the risk of
fire and human casualties.74

Figure 13 Illustration
of a possible flame retardant mechanism for the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
composite.

Three possible reasons may be
responsible for the effective enhancements on flame retardancy and
smoke suppression of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite.
First, with the encapsulation of DOPO organic molecules, MoS2–DOPO could be well dispersed in the FPUF matrix by strong
interface interaction. The well-dispersed state favorably exerts the
synergistic flame retardant effect between MoS2 nanosheets
and DOPO. Second, the two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets can
adsorb and capture hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds via weak van
der Waals interaction,75 resulting in the
effective physisorptions and chemisorptions. Moreover, the excellent
physical barrier effect of MoS2 nanosheets retards the
release of combustible pyrolysis products and the permeation of heat
and oxygen.76 This absorption and barrier
dual-effect is very helpful for the aggregation of smoke particles
to form char residues on the surfaces of MoS2 nanosheets.
MoS2 is oxidized into MoO3 by the reactive oxygen
species decomposed from the oxygen-containing pyrolysis products.67 MoO3 nanoparticles improves the thermal
oxidation resistance of the char residues. Third, DOPO can play a
crucial flame retardant role in the gas phase and condensed phase
simultaneously. PO• radicals released from DOPO
are able to scavenge the highly active H• and OH• radicals in the flame zone and intercept the radical
chain reactions in the flame zone,77 resulting
in an incomplete combustion and a decrease of the heat production.
The catalytic char-forming function is another important role of DOPO.
Part of the DOPO molecules is decomposed to oxygen-containing phosphorus
acids, which promotes dehydration and charring of the hydroxyl-containing
compounds to form the phosphocarbonaceous structure. Therefore, MoS2 nanosheets plays an important flame retardancy role in the
condensed phase, while DOPO plays an important free radical quenching
effect in the gas phase and the char-forming enhancement in the condensed
phase. As a result, MoS2–DOPO can significantly 
improve the flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties of
FPUF composite through a synergistic effect of gas and condensed bi-phase
action from MoS2 and DOPO.

Conclusions
In
this work, a novel MoS2–DOPO hybrid was successfully
synthesized using a facile two-step reaction approach. The structure
of the MoS2–DOPO hybrid was analyzed by the FTIR,
TEM, and EDX measurements. Subsequently, the synthesized MoS2–DOPO hybrid was used as an additive flame retardant to reduce
the fire hazards of FPUFs. SEM photographs of MoS2–DOPO/FPUF
confirmed the well-dispersed MoS2–DOPO in the FPUF
matrix and good compatibility between the MoS2–DOPO
nanoparticles and the FPUF matrix. The incorporation of MoS2–DOPO did not reduce significantly the mechanical properties
of FPUF. The MoS2–DOPO/FPUF composite exhibited
an obvious enhancement in thermal stability, flame retardancy, and
smoke suppression properties, compared with those of pure FPUF and
flame-retardant FPUF composites with a single MoS2 or DOPO.
Particularly, the THR and maximum smoke density of MoS2–DOPO/FPUF were decreased by 27.7 and 40.5%, respectively,
as a comparison with pure FPUF. Furthermore, the char residue analysis
manifested that the addition of MoS2–DOPO promoted
char formation in the condensed phase and MoS2 was oxidized
to MoO3 with excellent thermal oxidation resistance. Moreover,
the amount of volatilized pyrolysis products from FPUF decomposition
was significantly decreased. The enhanced flame retardancy and smoke
suppression of MoS2–DOPO/FPUF could be generally
attributed to the synergistic effect of MoS2 and DOPO,
including adsorption and physical barrier effects of MoS2 nanosheets, catalytic char-forming function, and free radical quenching
of DOPO. This study provides a new insight into fabricating organic–inorganic
hybrid flame retardants for halogen-free flame retarding polymer composites.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Pristine MoS2 powder was supplied
by Tianjin Chemical Reagent 4th Factory Kaida Chemical Plant (Tianjin,
China). NMP and 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
were obtained from by Chengdu Kelong Chemicals Co., Ltd (Sichuan,
China). DOPO was purchased by Guangdong Wengjiang Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). Polyether polyols (jmdyc-3000, number
average molecular weight of 3000, OH content of 56 mg of KOH/g), TDI,
triethylenediamine (A-33), and silicone oil (L-580) were obtained
from Jining Huakai Resin Co., Ltd (Shandong, China). AM and tin 2-ethylhexanoate
(purity 95%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology
Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All the reagents were analytical grade
and used as received without further purification.

Synthesis of
MoS2–DOPO Hybrid
The synthetic route of
the MoS2–DOPO is illustrated in Scheme 1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by ultrasonication-assisted exfoliation
method in a mixed solvent.78 Briefly, 1.0
g of pristine MoS2 was dispersed in a 160 mL of the mixed
solvent containing of NMP and 30% H2O2 (volume
ration: 15:1) and exfoliated by ultrasonication-assisted method at
a power of 600 W for 60 min. Subsequently, the black suspension was
centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min to collect MoS2 sediments.
The MoS2 sediments were washed three times with deionized
water and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 50 °C overnight to
obtain MoS2 nanosheets.

Then, 0.5 g of MoS2 nanosheets was dispersed in 300 mL of NMP by an ultrasonic wave
for 20 min. AM (1.0 mL) was added into the stable MoS2 dispersion
under continuous mechanical stirring 24 h. The obtained MoS2–allyl mercaptan (MoS2–AM) was collected
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm, repeatedly washed with ethanol, and
dried under a vacuum at 50 °C for 10 h. The MoS2–DOPO
hybrid was prepared by a solvothermal method. The detailed process
is as follows. MoS2–AM (0.5 g) and 0.2 g of DOPO
were mixed in 100 mL of anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 30 min
in an ultrasonic bath. Then, the mixture was loaded into a 200 mL
Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 12 h. Afterward,
the resulting products were filtered and washed with ethanol to remove
the residual DOPO. Lastly, the black MoS2–DOPO hybrid
was dried at 50 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.

Preparation
of the MoS2–DOPO/FPUF Composite
Pure FPUF
and the flame retardant FPUF composites were prepared using a conventional
one-pot and free-rising method. MoS2–DOPO/FPUF was
prepared by the following approach. Briefly, polyether polyols, chain
extender (tin 2-ethylhexanoate), catalyst (A-33), surfactant (L-580),
blowing agent (distilled water), and flame retardant (MoS2–DOPO) were first mixed in a 1 L plastic beaker through vigorous
mechanical stirring for 3 min. TDI was immediately added into the
mixture with vigorous stirring at 1000 rpm for 5 s. The mixture was
rapidly poured into an open plastic mold for free-rising of foam.
The foam was cured in an oven for 24 h at 50 °C, and taken out
of the mold. The formulations of the FPUFs are displayed in Table 1. The isocyanate index
(NCO/OH in mol) was 1.05. The pure FPUF, MoS2/FPU, and
DOPO/FPUF were also fabricated using a similar process, respectively.

Characterization
AFM was employed on a Bruker Multimode
8 in the tapping mode to analyze the thickness of MoS2 nanosheets,
and the sample was prepared by spin-coating on a freshly cleaved mica
surface. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer
over the wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 using
the KBr disk. TEM analyses were carried out using a JEM-2100 electron
microscope integrated with an EDX to investigate the morphology and
the elemental analysis of the samples, and the samples were prepared
by one drop casting on carbon-coated copper grids. The morphologies
of FPUFs and their char residues obtained from cone calorimeter tests
were investigated by a Zeiss EVO MA15 SEM, and the samples were coated
with a thin gold layer before observation. The elemental analysis
of the char residues obtained from cone calorimeter tests was analyzed
by an EDX (Oxford INCA 350). The densities of the FPUFs were measured
according to the ISO 845:2006 standard test method. The size of each
specimen was at least 100 cm3. The tensile strength and
the elongation at the break of the FPUFs were determined by tensile
measurements on an Instron 566 instrument following ISO 1798:2008
standard method. The 50% compression set test was examined in accordance
with the standard method ISO 1856:2000 (22 h, 70 °C) at 50% deformation,
and the dimensions of the sample were 50 × 50 × 25 mm3.79

TG analysis was carried
out on a Netzsch 209 F1 thermal analyzer (Netzsch, Germany) at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min in the nitrogen atmosphere range from room
temperature to 700 °C. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) values were
obtained using a HC-2C oxygen index instrument according to ISO 4589-1:1996
with sheet dimensions of 150 × 10 × 10 mm3. The
cone calorimeter test was performed with a cone calorimeter (Fire
Testing Technology, U.K.) following the ISO 5660-1 standard. The samples
were wrapped in aluminum foil and irradiated at a heat flux of 35
kW/m2. The size of each specimen was 100 × 100 ×
25 mm3. Smoke density tests were performed on a JQMY-2
smoke density chamber (Jianqiao Co, China) according to ISO 5659-2
standard procedures. Samples with a size of 75 × 75 × 3
mm3 were wrapped in aluminum foil and irradiated horizontally
under an external heat flux of 25 kW/m2 with an additional
pilot burner. Two tests were carried out for one sample. XRD measurements
were carried out with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer equipped
with a Cu Kα radiation tube (λ = 0.1542 nm) at room temperature.
The scanning range was from 5 to 60°. TG-IR measurements were
conducted using a TGA Q5000 IR TG analyzer connected to a Nicolet
6700 FTIR spectrophotometer. Each sample specimen was heated from
room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min
under a nitrogen flow of 30 mL/min.
