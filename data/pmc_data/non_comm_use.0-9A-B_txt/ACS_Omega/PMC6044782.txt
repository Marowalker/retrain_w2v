Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) are excellent supports for electrocatalysts
because of their large surface area, excellent electronic conductivity,
and high chemical and structural stability. In the present study,
the activity of CNTs on direct electron transfer (DET) and on immobilized
glucose oxidase (GOX) is studied as a function of number
of walls of CNTs. The results indicate that the GOX immobilized
by the CNTs maintains its electrocatalytic activity toward glucose;
however, the DET and electrocatalytic activity of GOX depend
strongly on the number of inner tubes of CNTs. The GOX immobilized
on triple-walled CNTs (TWNTs) has the highest electron-transfer rate
constant, 1.22 s–1, for DET, the highest sensitivity
toward glucose detection, 66.11 ± 5.06 μA mM–1 cm–2, and the lowest apparent Michaelis–Menten
constant, 6.53 ± 0.58 mM, as compared to GOX immobilized
on single-walled and multiwalled CNTs. The promotion effect of CNTs
on the GOX electrocatalytic activity and DET is most likely
due to the electron-tunneling effect between the outer wall and inner
tubes of TWNTs. The results of this study have general implications
for the fundamental understanding of the role of CNT supports in DET
processes and can be used for the better design of more effective
electrocatalysts for biological processes including biofuel cells
and biosensors.

1 Introduction
Direct electrochemistry of redox enzymes/proteins such as glucose
oxidase (GOX) plays an important role in the glucose oxidation
reactions in enzyme-immobilized electrodes in microbial and enzymatic
fuel cells1−5 and in glucose biosensors.5−7 In enzymatic/microbial fuel cells
and electrochemical biosensors, enzymes or microbes are generally
immobilized on electrode material surfaces; however, a key issue in
such systems is the efficient electron transfer (ET) between the active
centers and the supporting substrate or electrode.3,8,9 In the case of GOX, direct ET
(DET) with the bare electrode is difficult because of the fact that
the redox active flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactors, that
is, small nonproteinaceous electroactive species, of GOX are deeply buried within electrically well-insulated prosthetic
shells.10,11 Thus, considerable efforts have been made
to enhance the DET of GOX via the redox mediators and the
selected matrix and to develop new and high-performance biofuel cells
and enzymatic electrochemical biosensors.3,8,12,13

Mediators
such as 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, thionin, ferrocene
monocarboxylic acid, and methylene blue offer advantages for immobilization
of enzymes and enhancement of DET capacity and power output of biofuel
cells.14−17 In mediated ET using electroactive molecules or mediators to shuttle
electrons between the enzyme and the electrode, the maximum cell voltage
of biofuel cells is determined by the thermodynamic redox potential
of mediators. A more positive redox potential is required to provide
the driving force for the ET between the enzyme active center and
the electrode for the oxidation biocatalysts, which contributes to
cell voltage loss. Another area of intensive research is to use advanced
smart carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),18−21 carbon black,22,23 carbon nanoparticles (NPs),24 vertically aligned CNTs,25 and graphene,13,26 in immobilization and
growth of enzymes/proteins and living cells for various biological
processes and for electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cells. Among
them, CNTs have attracted considerable attention for potential applications
such as supporting materials for enzymes owing to their unique electrical
conductivity, high chemical stability, biocompatibility, and large
surface area.18−20,27 However, it has been
shown that the physical and chemical properties of CNTs can influence
the adsorption and activity of immobilized enzymes.28,29 Pang et al. studied the effect of various carbon materials on the
enzyme loading and laccase activity, including fullerene (C-60), multiwalled
CNTs (MWNTs), oxidized MWNTs, and graphene oxide and found that the
immobilized enzymes have significantly reduced reaction rates as compared
to free laccase.30 This has been attributed
to the nanomatrix-induced diffusional limitation on the enzyme activity.

Recently, we have found that pristine CNTs composed of 2–3
concentric tubes or walls have significantly higher electrochemical
activities for O2 evolution reactions (OERs) as compared
with typical single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) and MWNTs .31 The electrocatalytic activity of CNTs shows a distinct
volcano-type curve as a function of the number of walls of CNTs. Similar
volcano curves were also observed on Pt and Pd NP-supported CNTs for
methanol, ethylene glycol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation in alkaline
solutions and on dye-functionalized CNTs for photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting.32−35 This indicates that the number of walls or inner tubes of CNTs plays
an important role in promoting the ET of the electrochemical redox
reaction on the surface of CNTs, and such a promotion effect could
be beneficial to the DET of the redox reactions of enzymes/proteins.
Here, the effects of quantum properties of CNTs on the DET and electrocatalytic
activity of GOX toward glucose oxidation were studied.
The results indicate that triple-walled CNTs (TWNTs) facilitate fast
DET of GOX and enhance the electrocatalytic activity for
glucose sensing, as compared to that on SWNTs and MWNTs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 CNTs and Direct Electrochemistry
of GOX/CNT-Modified Glassy Carbon Electrodes
Figure 1 shows the transmission
electron
microscopy (TEM) micrographs of the CNTs used in this study. CNTs
were divided into four groups, depending on the number of walls. CNT-1
mainly consists of SWNTs (79%) with an outer diameter (OD) of 1.97
nm. CNT-2 is dominated by TWNTs (52%) and double-walled CNTs (DWNTs,
25%) with an OD of 3.80 nm. The average number of walls of CNT-3 is
seven with an OD of 7.45 nm, whereas CNT-4 is a typical MWNT with
an average of 12 walls and an OD of 13.9 nm. CNTs with a small OD
prefer to form bundles because of the van der Waals interactions;36 however, CNTs with a large OD, CNT-3 and CNT-4,
are well-dispersed without bundles. After purification, the amount
of Fe, Co, Mo, and Ni elements are substantially reduced to less than
100 ppm as confirmed by the inductively coupled plasmaoptical emission
spectroscopy analysis. The details of CNTs used in this study can
be found elsewhere.32 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of CNTs is in the range of 271–577 m2 g–1. Table 1 summarizes the average number of walls and surface
areas of CNTs.

Figure 2A shows
the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the bare glassy carbon (GC) and
CNT-modified GC electrodes in an N2-saturated 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. No reduction or oxidation peaks were observed in the CVs of both
bare GC and CNT-modified electrodes. However, the CNT-modified GC
electrodes show substantially high background current as compared
to bare GC electrodes, indicating the high active sites of CNTs and
the formation of well-integrated CNT-modified GC electrodes. In the
case of GOX/CNT-modified electrodes, a pair of well-defined
and symmetrical redox peaks with equal oxidation and reduction peak
heights at about −0.48 V appears (Figure 2B). It is well-known that the cofactor of
GOX, existing in two different states, FAD (oxidized form)
and FADH2 (reduced form), can work as an electron acceptor
and donor alternatively in redox reactions.37 The observed redox peaks indicate that FAD from GOX can
undergo reversible direct electrochemical oxidation and reduction
on the GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes without the help
of the electron-transfer mediators. On the other hand, the CV obtained
from the electrode modified with GOX only is featureless,
indicating that the DET between the GC electrode and FAD, the active
redox center of GOX, is very weak without CNT modification.
CNTs have the excellent electron-transport property and high special
surface area, which promotes significantly the ET and facilitates
the DET process between the redox center of GOX and the
GC electrode substrate as shown in this study and also by others.18−20,37 The distinct differences of the
electrochemical behavior of CNTs, GOX, and GOX/CNTs as shown in Figure 2 also clearly indicate the immobilization of GOX on CNTs. The immobilization of GOX on CNTs is most likely
due to the π=π and σ–π stacking,
similar to that observed in the case of polyelectrolyte-functionalized
CNTs.38−41

recorded at (A) bare GC electrode and CNT-modified electrodes
and (B) GOX and GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes
in an N2-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution at a scan rate of
50 mV s–1.

The oxidation and reduction peak potentials are located in
the
potential range between −0.431 and −0.473 V (vs Ag/AgCl).
The formal potential (E°) of the electrodes,
calculated by averaging the cathodic and anodic peak potential, is
in the range of 0.449–0.458 V, which is close to the standard
potential of FAD/FADH2 (i.e., −0.460 V in pH 7.0
at 25.8 °C). Similar values were also reported for other GOX-modified GC electrodes.42,43 The separation
potential of the cathodic and anodic peaks, ΔEp, depends on the CNTs. The ΔEp values of GOX/CNT-1, GOX/CNT-2, GOX/CNT-3, and GOX/CNT-4 are 35, 24, 31, and 34 mV,
respectively. For the redox reaction on GOX/CNTs, the ΔEp value shows the lowest value at the GOX/CNT-2-modified GC electrode, 0.024 V, proving a fast electron-transfer
process on GOX-immobilized CNT-2. Periasamy et al. studied
the direct electrochemistry of GOX at gelatin- and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-dispersed MWNTs
and GMWNT- and DMWNT-modified GC electrodes, and observed that the
difference of ΔEp for GOX/GMWNT and GOX/DMWNT is 14 mV (ΔEp was 47 mV for GOX/GMWNT and 33 mV for GOX/DMWNT).44 This is close to the
difference of ∼10 mV of the ΔEp values between GOX/CNT-2 and GOX/CNT-1 and
between GOX/CNT-2 and GOX/CNT-4. The experiments
were repeated several times, and the peak potentials were generally
reproducible with an SD of ∼7%. The electrochemical parameters
for the DET of GOX at different CNT-modified GC electrodes
are given in Table 2.

The
reversibility of DET of GOX on CNT-modified GC electrodes
was investigated by CVs at different scan rates under N2-saturated conditions (Figure 3). With the increase of the scan rates, the anodic peak potentials
are shifted to a more positive potential, whereas the cathodic peaks
are shifted towards more negative potential with no change in the
formal potential, E°. The linear increase in
the peak current with scan rates (the insets of Figure 3) demonstrates that the redox reaction of
FAD/FADH2 involved in the GOX adsorbed on the
CNT supports is a surface-controlled process but not a diffusion-controlled
process.7,43 The ET rate constant (ks) can be calculated from ΔEp using the Laviron equation for a surface-controlled electrochemical
system45 with a charge transfer coefficient
(α) of 0.5. The ks values of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes were determined to be 0.984 s–1 for GOX/CNT-1, 1.22 s–1 for GOX/CNT-2, 1.064 s–1 for GOX/CNT-3, and 1.004 s–1 for GOX/CNT-4. The ks value obtained on the
GOX/CNT-2-modified electrode is also higher than 1.16 cm
s–1 reported by Deng et al. for the redox reaction
of GOX on the undoped CNTs but lower than 1.56 s–1 on boron-doped CNTs.7 The high ks values mean faster electron-transfer rate
between the electrode and the redox-active center of the enzyme.7 The significant dependence of the ks on CNT supports indicates that the DET of GOX depends on the number of walls of CNT supports, similar to that
observed for alcohol oxidation and OERs in alkaline solutions.31,32

250, 300, 350, and 400 mV s–1. Inset shows the linear
dependence of Ipa and Ipc on the scan rate.

2.2 Electrocatalytic Activity of GOX/CNT-Modified GC Electrodes
Figure 4 shows the electrochemical behavior of the
GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes in N2- and O2-saturated PBS solutions. There are two clearly separated
reduction peaks for the reaction on the GOX/CNT-modified
GC electrodes in O2-saturated PBS solutions, except that
on GOX/CNT-4. The first one around −0.35 V is most
likely associated with the reduction reaction of O2 by
CNTs. This is consistent with an early study that except MWNTs, pristine
CNTs have a considerable electrochemical activity for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR).46 This appears
to be supported by the observation of a broad reduction peak at −0.4
V for the reaction on GOX/CNT-4-modified GC electrodes,
which is consistent with the observed oxygen reduction shoulder near
−0.4 V on gelatin- and DMF-dispersed MWNT-modified GC electrodes.44 The second one around −0.45 V is the
O2 reduction peak by GOX. However, the reduction
peak current of the GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes increases
significantly in O2-saturated PBS solution, as compared
with that recorded under N2-saturated conditions, with
subsequently reduced oxidation current. This implies that GOX immobilized on CNTs catalyzes O2 reduction effectively
because of the fact that O2 is a cosubstrate of GOX. The direct electrochemistry of GOX is a two-electron
two-proton process and undergoes a redox reaction between GOX(FAD) and GOX(FADH2). FADH2 could
be oxidized by O2 at the GOX/CNT-modified GC
electrodes, which causes the increase of the reduction peak current
of GOX (FAD) 1  

Figure 4 CVs recorded at (A) GOX/CNT-1-, (B) GOX/CNT-2-,
(C) GOX/CNT-3-, and (D) GOX/CNT-4-modified GC
electrodes in an N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 M
PBS solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

This is consistent with other
studies on different GOX-immobilized electrodes.6,7

The reduction peak currents at the GOX/CNT-modified
GC electrodes decrease gradually with the addition of glucose in an
O2-saturated PBS solution (Figure 5). This indicates that GOX immobilized
on CNTs retains its bioelectrocatalytic activity to glucose because
of the fact that glucose is the natural substrate of GOX.6 The presence of glucose will lead to
an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and decrease the concentration of the
oxidized form of GOX, that is, GOX(FAD), and
thus the decrease of the reduction current. 2

GOX/CNT-3, and (D) GOX/CNT-4-modified GC electrodes
in an O2-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution at different concentrations
of glucose (with 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400,
1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, and 2600 μL of 0.1 M glucose solution
into 40 mL of PBS solution from outer to inner curves).

To further investigate the effect of different
CNT supports on
the current response of the GOX/CNT-based glucose biosensor,
the amperometric responses of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes
have been determined on successive injections of glucose to an O2-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution under an applied potential of
−0.48 V versus Ag/AgCl. As shown in Figure 6, the reduction currents decrease with the
increase of the glucose concentration. On the basis of the decrease
of the reduction current, the concentration of glucose can be detected.
Therefore, the GOX/CNT-modified GC electrode can be used
as a glucose biosensor. Figure 7 shows the corresponding plots of the reduction current measured
at −0.48 V at GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes versus
the glucose concentration. The reduction currents of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes change linearly with the concentration
of glucose up to 4.31–5.44 mM, with a correlation coefficient
greater than 0.994. The sensitivity of the GOX/CNT-modified
GC electrodes is calculated to be 37.38 ± 5.75, 66.11 ±
5.06, 35.75 ± 2.23, and 36.77 ± 4.88 μA mM–1 cm–2 on GOX-immobilized CNT-1-, CNT-2-,
CNT-3-, and CNT-4-modified GC electrodes, respectively. The sensitivity
obtained on GOX/CNT-4 is close to 40.14 μA mM–1 cm–2, which is reported on GOX immobilized on undoped MWNTs.7 Similar to ks, the highest sensitivity
is obtained on GOX immobilized on TWNTs, GOX/CNT-2.

of 0.1 M glucose to 40 mL of 0.1 M PBS solution. Solution was stirred
at 150 rpm. Applied potential: −0.48 V vs Ag/AgCl.

Figure 7 Current changes obtained from the amperometric curves
of about
the four electrodes in the different glucose concentrations in 0.1
M PBS solution. Solution was stirred at 150 rpm. Applied potential:
−0.48 V vs Ag/AgCl.

The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (KMapp) is an
indicator of the enzymatic activity of the immobilized GOX and can be estimated by the Lineweaver–Burk equation8 3  where iSS is the
steady-state response current after the addition of the substrate, imax is the maximum current under saturated substrate
conditions, and Cglucose is the bulk glucose
concentration. Under the conditions of this study, and KMapp of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes is estimated to be in the range
of 6.53–11.49 mM. The low KMapp value implies a strong ability
of substrate binding and high enzymatic activity of the immobilized
GOX. Consistent with the high transfer rate and high sensitivity,
the GOX/CNT-2-modified GC electrode exhibits the smallest KMapp value, 6.53 ± 0.58 mM, indicating that the GOX immobilized
on the TWNTs maintains an excellent catalyst activity and exhibits
fabulous affinity toward glucose. Table 3 summarizes the sensitivity and KMapp values
of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes.

2.3 Role of the Number of Walls of CNT Supports
Before the discussion of the role of the number of inner tubes
on the electrochemical behavior of GOX immobilized on CNTs,
it is necessary to clarify the effect of the surface areas and residual
metal impurities of CNTs used in this study. In catalysis, the electrocatalytic
activity of catalysts is generally normalized with the surface area of the catalytic
NPs to eliminate or avoid the effect of the size of the catalysts.
It is well-known that the size of supported catalytic NPs plays a
determining role in their activity and stability, and the catalytic
specific activity usually increases with the decreasing NP size because
of the rising number of low-coordinated metal atoms and/or defects
as the catalytically active sites.47,48 In this study,
the BET surface area of CNTs is close for CNTs with the number of
layers from 1 to 7: 577, 523, and 539 m2 g–1 for CNT-1, CNT-2, and CNT-3 (see Table 1), respectively. Only in the case of CNTs
with 12 layers (CNT-4, MWNTs), the surface area decreased significantly
to 271 m2 g–1. This indicates that if
the surface area of CNT substrates is a dominant fact in the electrochemical
behavior of GOX/CNTs, the electrochemical activity of GOX/CNTs should be similar at least for GOX immobilized
on CNT-1, CNT-2, and CNT-3. However, this is not the case, as shown
in this study, and the electrocatalytic activity of GOX/CNTs depends strongly on CNT-1, CNT-2, and CNT-3, and the best results
were obtained on GOX/CNT-2, even though the surface area
of CNT-2 is actually slightly lower than that of CNT-1. Despite the
fact that the surface area of CNT-1 is much higher than that of CNT-4,
their ks, sensitivities, and KMapp values
are very close (Tables 2 and 3). Therefore, the surface area is not
a dominant factor in the DET and electrocatalytic activity of GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes. The amounts of metallic impurities
of CNT supports after purification are less than 100 ppm.32 As shown in Figure 2A, pristine CNTs show no redox peaks in 0.1
M PBS solution, indicating that such low levels of metallic impurities
in CNTs do not contribute to the electrochemical properties of GOX.

As shown by Marcus and Sutin, the ET rate exponentially
depends on the distance of the closest approach between an electron
donor and acceptor and is negligible for distances beyond 2 nm.49 This indicates that the DET of FAD active sites
deeply embedded (∼1.5 nm) within the protein to the electrode
surfaces would be very difficult. This is supported by the featurelessness
of the CV curves of GOX-modified GC electrodes without
immobilization of CNTs (Figure 2B). It has been well-known that CNTs promote the DET to GOX.3,7,18−20,22,50 However, the results of the current study demonstrate for the first
time that the direct electrochemistry and DET of redox centers of
GOX immobilized on CNTs also depend critically on the nature
of CNT supports, that is, the number of walls or inner tubes. Among
the CNTs studied, CNT-2 shows the best results to enhance the DET
and the biocatalytic activity of GOX toward glucose, showing
the highest ks, highest sensitivity, and
lowest KMapp value.

As shown early, pristine CNTs
are inherently electrocatalytically
active for the OER, ORR, and H2 evolution reaction (HER)
in alkaline solutions, showing a distinct volcano-type curve as a
function of the number of inner tubes or walls.31,46 The intrinsic activity of pristine CNTs has been evidently demonstrated
by the KCN blockage experiments, in which cyanide ions, CN–1, strongly coordinate with transition metals such as Co, Fe, and
Ni in the axial position,51,52 thus completely blocking
and poisoning the metallic impurities on the side walls of CNTs. In
the presence of KCN, CNTs show distinctive activity volcano curves,
which are identical to those observed on the pristine CNTs in the
absence of KCN.46 This evidently demonstrates
that the inner tubes of CNTs play a significant role in the enhancement
of the charge transfer of the reactions such as OER, ORR, and HER
via the electron-tunneling effect between the outer and inner walls.46

The strong promotion effect of inner tubes
on the electrocatalytic
activity of CNTs has also demonstrated the electrooxidation of alcohols
on Pt and Pd NPs supported on CNTs, with highest activities observed
on Pt and Pd NPs supported on CNTs with 2–3 walls.32−34 As shown in Figure 8, the ks and sensitivity values show
distinctive volcano curves, whereas the KMapp values exhibit
a reversed volcano curve as a function of the number of walls, identical
to that observed for alcohol oxidation and OERs in alkaline solutions.31−33 A high ks value of 1.22 s–1 obtained for the DET of GOX/CNT-2 indicates the fast
ET for the direct electrochemistry of GOX immobilized on
TWNTs, as compared to that immobilized on conventional SWNTs and MWNTs.
The observation of the distinguished volcano-type curves of the electrocatalytic
activity of GOX/CNTs in this study and that of pristine
CNTs and Pt and Pd NPs supported on CNTs as a function of number of
inner tubes or walls, despite the significant differences in the electrochemical
systems, clearly indicates the existence of the inherent electrocatalytic
activities of CNTs. The promotion effect of inner tubes has also been
demonstrated most recently on the dye-functionalized CNTs for PEC
water splitting, in which the dye-functionalized DWNTs and TWNTs show
a much higher PEC activity for water splitting as compared to that
of SWNTs and MWNTs.35 In other words, the
promotion effect of CNTs via the electron-tunneling mechanism is an
intrinsic property of CNTs with a defined number of walls. Thus, the
reason for the observation of the highest DET and electrocatalytic
activity of GOX immobilized on CNT-2, a mixture of TWNTs
and DWNTs, is most likely the facile charge-transfer process via the
electron tunneling between the outer wall and inner tubes of CNT-2
under the influence of an electrochemical driving force, which is
consistent with previous studies.31−34,46Figure 9 shows schematically
the DET of the redox-active center of GOX and CNTs facilitated
by the electron tunneling between the outer wall and inner tubes of
CNTs.

GC electrodes as a function of the number of inner tubes of CNT substrates.

Figure 9 Scheme of the DET and electrocatalytic activity
of GOX immobilized on TWNTs via the electron-tunneling
mechanism between
the outer wall and inner tubes of TWNTs.

Similar to the electrochemical reactions of OER on CNTs,31,46 such effective charge or ET as described above would not be possible
for the GOX supported on SWNTs and GOX/CNT-1
and diminishes as the number of walls increases because of the significantly
reduced polarization driving force or dc bias across the walls or
layers of CNTs for the ET between the outer wall and inner tubes.
Thus, the ET efficiency of the redox reaction of GOX immobilized
on CNT-2, a mixture of DWNTs and TWNTs, is much higher when the ET
is between the outer wall and inner tubes as compared to that on SWNTs
and MWNTs, GOX/CNT-1, and GOX/CNT-4.

As
pointed out by Chen et al., the structural factors such as the
number of layers, size, and chirality, and layer stacking modes can
significantly alter the heterogeneous electron-transfer efficiency
at sp2 nanocarbons such as graphene and CNTs.53,54 CNTs act as electrical conducting nanowires for the fast DET between
the active sites in GOX and substrate electrodes. The electron
tunneling or transfer efficiency between CNTs and the GOX active sites depends on the density of states (DOS) and the layers
of CNTs. For SWNTs, the DOS is rather low near their Fermi levels,
and therefore, the ET efficiency is very low. Increasing the wall
numbers would increase the DOS near the Fermi level, which would increase
the ET efficiency. On the other hand, however, the increase of wall
numbers (thickness) of CNTs could increase the ET distance, which
could lower the ET efficiency. Thus, CNTs with 2–3 walls may
provide an optimized balance between these two effects. This also
explains the observed high electrocatalytic activity of CNT-2 toward
glucose.

3 Conclusions
In the
present study, we studied in detail the effect of CNT supports
on the DET and electrocataytic activities of GOX in 0.1
M PBS solution. A pair of well-defined and fundamentally reversible
redox peaks was observed, indicating an excellent DET between the
redox centers of GOX and GC electrodes without the help
of the electron-transfer mediators or metallic NPs to contact the
FAD active centers. Furthermore, the GOX immobilized by
the CNTs still maintained its biocatalytic activity toward glucose.
However, the direct electrochemistry and electrocatalytic activity
of GOX depend strongly on the nature of CNT supports, showing
distinct volcano curves as a function of the number of walls. GOX immobilized on CNT-2, a mixture of TWNTs and DWNTs, is most
effective in promoting the DET and electrocatalytic activity toward
glucose, showing the highest ks value
and sensitivity and the lowest KMapp. The excellent promotion effect
of CNT-2 is ascribed to the fast DET via the efficient electron tunneling
between the outer wall and inner tubes of CNTs. The results demonstrate
that the DET and electrocatalytic activities of GOX immobilized
on CNTs can be manipulated by the quantum properties of CNT supports.
This has general implications for the fundamental understanding of
the role of CNT supports in the DET or ET processes, and the results
can be used for the better design of biocatalysts for biofuel cell
and biosensor applications. For the development of practical biocatalysts,
the addition of electrocatalysts would be beneficial to further increase
the activity and sensitivity. However, as shown in the present study,
the use of CNT supports with 2–3 inner tubes would significantly
enhance the activity and sensitivity of the electrocatalysts in applications
such as biofuel cells and glucose biosensors.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Solutions
Glucose oxidase
(GOX, EC 1.1.3.4, 100–250 U/mg, type X-S from Aspergillus niger), d-(+)-glucose, DMF,
sodium phosphate monobasic, and sodium phosphate dibasic were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Nafion solution (5 wt % in isopropanol and water)
was purchased from DuPont Inc. Four CNTs with different number of
walls were purchased from Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials
Inc., USA. Deionized double-distilled water (18.6 MΩ, Millipore)
was used throughout the experiment.

CNTs were purified using
ultrasonic treatment in 32 wt % HCl solution (Ajax Finechem) for 6
h and then stirred at room temperature for 48 h. CNTs were characterized
by TEM (JEOL 3000F) with an operation voltage of 200 kV, and the BET
surface area of CNTs was measured by Micromeritics TriStar II. PBS
solutions (0.1 M, pH 7.4) were prepared by mixing 0.1 M NaH2PO4 and 0.1 M Na2HPO4, and the pH
of the solution was adjusted by adding H3PO4 or NaOH. Glucose stock solution was prepared by PBS solution and
stored for at least 24 h at room temperature before use. CNTs (∼2
mg) were dispersed into 5 mL DMF and then ultrasonicated for 1 h to
form a stable CNT suspension. GOX solution (10 mg mL–1) was stored in −4 °C. All aqueous solutions
were prepared with double-distilled deionized water.

4.2 Preparation of GOX/CNT-Modified
Electrodes
The 4.0 mm diameter GC electrode was polished
with 3 μm alumina powder and sonicated in deionized water for
5 min, and it served as the working electrode. After drying, the GOX/CNT film electrodes were prepared by successively casting
5 μL of CNT suspensions and GOX solution on the electrode
surface. After CNTs and GOX solution deposition, the solvent
was allowed to evaporate at room temperature. To protect the working
electrode, 5 μL of Nafion solution was dropped on the surface
of the cast electrode films and dried at room temperature.

4.3 Characterization
Electrochemical
measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell
with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode in
N2- or O2-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution, using
a CHI6044D electrochemical work station. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode
was kept in saturated KCl solution. CVs of the bare GC and GOX/CNT-modified GC electrodes were generally obtained at a scan
rate of 50 mV s–1. The amperometric measurements
were performed at a fixed potential (−0.48 V vs Ag/AgCl). Glucose
(100 μL, 0.1 M) was directly added to 40 mL of 0.1 M PBS solution
at 0 s with the successive increase of the glucose concentration (100
μL, 0.1 M glucose). The reason for performing the amperometric
measurements at this fixed potential is to maximize the activity and
sensitivity of measurements, as −0.48 V is close to the cathodic
peak potential of direct electrochemistry of GOX/CNT-modified
GC, as shown in the results section. The experiments were repeated
at least three times, and the results were presented as the average
values.
