In this study, we used a quantitative analytical method
to indicate
creaming behavior in an emulsion. An oil-in-water emulsion was directly
measured by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry, and the time profiles of the peak areas of an oil
component, styrene, were obtained at heights of 1, 2, and 3 cm from
the bottom of a sample that had a height of 4 cm. All time profiles
roughly indicated that the signal intensity increased once, then decreased,
and finally settled. Moreover, we proposed a fitting equation for
the time profiles by subtracting two sigmoid functions, whereby the
degree of the signal increases at the initial stage, the degree of
the signal decreases after the increase, and the times for continuing
the higher signal intensities were all longer as the monitoring positions
were raised. This method would surely provide useful information about
emulsions that undergo creaming behavior.

Introduction
An emulsion is a system where one of two
immiscible liquids is
dispersed into the other as a small droplet; an oil-in-water (O/W)
emulsion occurs when oil is dispersed into water, and dispersing water
into oil creates a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. Emulsion products
include cosmetics, inks, and paints, and the stability of these products
is very important. Creaming is one of the main phenomena of the collapse
processes of an emulsion1,2 where dispersed droplets
move to the top or the bottom (sedimentation) according to the differences
in the density between the droplets and the medium in a continuous
phase. Creaming behavior is completely different according to the
preparation conditions, for example, concentrations of oils and surfactants,
which are normally used as emulsifiers, and the stirring conditions.
An analytical method that could accurately evaluate the collapse behaviors
would help optimize the preparation conditions and more consistently
produce a stable emulsion. The creaming rate of an isolated rigid
spherical particle in an ideal liquid is given by Stokes’ law.3,4 In a practical setting, the creaming behavior of an emulsion is
visually monitored5 or can be measured
using one of several analytical methods4 such as transmittance measurement, use of a back-scattering technique,6−8 nuclear magnetic resonance,9 and ultrasound
velocity scanning.10 Several reports have
discussed the creaming stability of emulsions by measuring at different
heights.7,11−13

Resonance-enhanced
multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(REMPI-TOFMS) using an ultraviolet laser as the ionization source
is a selective analytical method that can selectively ionize target
analytes via resonance transition.14−21 This method is normally applied to the measurement of gas samples.
On the other hand, we recently reported the REMPI-TOFMS results of
a direct mass analysis of oil in an emulsion, that is, without any
pretreatment and separation procedures.22−29 A series of mass spectra can be obtained via the continuous measurement
of an O/W emulsion. During the measurement, when oil droplets are
introduced into REMPI-TOFMS, the signal intensity arising from the
constituent instantly increases. Intense spikes appear on a time profile
plotted by the peak area of the component, which reveals the existence
of oil droplets in the emulsion.29 Moreover,
an averaged time profile of the peak areas provides valuable information
concerning the change in the concentration of an oil component.28 We recently used REMPI-TOFMS to measure an O/W
emulsion in the process of creaming and also employed ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometry (UV–vis) to measure transmittance. These
techniques offer information of the changes in concentration and turbidity,
respectively, and we reported the differences between the two time
profiles.30 Although a highly turbid emulsion
cannot be measured using UV–vis, REMPI-TOFMS is applicable
even to such an emulsion. Therefore, this technique is a novel analytical
method that could be used to evaluate the stability of an emulsion.

In the present study, to quantitatively evaluate creaming behavior,
REMPI-TOFMS was used to continuously measure an O/W emulsion at different
monitoring positions in terms of height, and the differences in the
time profiles of an oil component were confirmed. Moreover, a fitting
equation for the time profiles was proposed, and the kinetics of the
creaming of the present emulsion was discussed.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Sample Preparation
Styrene (density 0.902–0.910
g/mL) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which were used as an oil
phase and an emulsifier, respectively, were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) and were used without further purification.
Distilled water was prepared in our laboratory.

Sample preparation
procedures are as follows. First, 0.06 g of SDS was dissolved in 20
mL of water in a 30 mL vial container. Then, 44 μL of styrene
was added and homogenized using a homogenizer (AHG-160D, AS ONE, Osaka)
fitted with a shaft generator (HT1010, AS ONE) operated at 5000 rpm
for 10 min. The concentration of styrene was 2 g/L. Finally, 4 mL
of the prepared emulsion was transferred to a cuvette, resulting in
a sample with a height of 4 cm.

Apparatus and Data Acquisition/Analysis
The experimental
setup is shown in Figure 1. A linear-type TOFMS was used, which was previously described
in detail,22 and is briefly described herein.

Figure 1 Experimental
apparatus. Heights of the monitoring position at (a)
1, (b) 2, and (c) 3 cm from the bottom are also indicated.

A pair of concentric capillary columns was constructed
for sample
introduction, both of which were deactivated fused-silica capillary
columns (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The tip of the inner capillary
was set 2 mm inward from the tip of the outer capillary. An emulsion
sample flowed through an inner capillary (inner diameter 25 μm,
outer diameter 150 μm, and 60 cm in length), while ambient air
flowed through an outer capillary (inner diameter 320 μm, outer
diameter 450 μm, 40 cm in length). The flow rate of air was
adjusted to 2 mL/min using a flowmeter.

The fourth harmonic
of a Nd:YAG laser (GAIA II, wavelength 266
nm, pulse width 4 ns, repetition rate 10 Hz, Rayture Systems, Tokyo,
Japan) was used as the ionization laser. The pulse energy was adjusted
to 20 μJ. The pulses were focused using a plano-convex lens
with a focal length of 200 mm and were aligned 2 mm away from the
tip of the outer capillary column.

A series of mass spectra
was recorded using a digitizer (AP240,
bandwidth 1 GHz, sampling rate 1 GS/s, Acqiris/Agilent Technologies,
Tokyo, Japan). The recording was simultaneously started when an inner
capillary column was inserted into a cuvette containing a sample.
The monitoring positions were set 1, 2, and 3 cm from the bottom of
a cuvette (Figure 1). From the series of mass spectra, a molecular ion peak of styrene
(m/z 104) was selected and the peak
areas were extracted in order to construct a time profile. As will
be described later, Figure 3 shows the time profiles of the peak areas measured at each
monitoring position, which were plotted without averaging. On the
other hand, Figure 4 shows the averaged time profiles, which were obtained by processing
as follows. First, the data of the peak area at each monitoring position,
as shown in Figure 3, were averaged for every 2 min (120 plots) in each experiment, and
then, the averaged time profiles were divided by the sum of the entire
peak area for standardization. Next, the time profiles of three measurements
obtained at each monitoring position were averaged. Finally, the sum
of the entire area obtained at each monitoring position was calculated,
and the specific values according to the ratios of all areas, 1:2.4:2.7,
were calculated from 1, 2, and 3 cm, respectively, and were then multiplied
to give the respective time profiles. The fit of the averaged time
profiles was accomplished using data-analysis software (Origin, LightStone,
Tokyo, Japan).

Results and Discussion
Features of an Emulsion
Figure 2 shows the features of an emulsion transferred
to a cuvette after preparation in a vial container, and an emulsion
that remained in its vial container following preparation. The emulsion
had a white turbidity just after preparation. In the case of the sample
that remained in the vial container, the turbidity just after the
preparation was higher than that of the other sample, and the lower
portion of this sample turned transparent with time. Therefore, the
creaming surely occurred toward the upper side in this emulsion. However,
the change in the turbidity of the emulsion in the cuvette was often
difficult to confirm by time using only eyesight. Therefore, an evaluation
of the creaming behavior is still necessary because it differs depending
on the conditions—as with this case where the samples were
exactly the same.

Time Profiles Obtained from Different Positions in Terms of
Height
In the present study, the changes with time in the
peak areas of styrene in an O/W emulsion in a cuvette were investigated
at each monitoring position during the creaming process.

Figure 3 shows the time profiles
of the peak areas for styrene obtained at monitoring positions 1,
2, and 3 cm from the bottom of a cuvette. In all cases, a signal for
styrene was first detected at ca. 2 min after the recording had begun,
which was then followed by many spikes. The appearance of intense
spikes indicates that relatively large styrene droplets have flowed
and were then vaporized into the TOFMS. Among the measurements, the
spike intensities, as shown in Figure 3a, mostly decreased with time. These results suggest
that the abundance of large styrene droplets gradually decreased with
time at the monitoring positions because of creaming. Similar decreases
in signal behaviors have previously been reported.22,29,30 On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3b,c, the spike intensities
were not necessarily confirmed to have decreased with time. The changes
in the size and number of styrene droplets seem complicated and particularly
so at higher positions; other collapse processes such as flocculation
and coalescence should be considered.

In order to detail the
differences in the time profiles obtained
at each monitoring position, each time profile was averaged for every
2 min. The averaged time profiles of the peak areas of styrene obtained
at the monitoring positions 1, 2, and 3 cm from the bottom of the
cuvette are shown in Figure 4. The fit results are also shown in this figure; the fitting
equation and kinetics will be discussed later.

As shown in Figure 4a, the signal intensity
of styrene 1 cm from the bottom increased
once and then gradually decreased and settled at ca. 20 min. In the
averaged time profiles at 2 and 3 cm from the bottom, as shown in Figure 4b,c, the signal intensities
were also roughly increased and then decreased, but the times that
maintained strong signal intensities continued for a while. These
results suggest that a floating phenomenon of the emulsion prepared
in the present study surely occurred, although the change in the turbidity
was not necessarily clear by the naked eye. A possible reason for
the signal increase followed by a decrease could be the creaming of
flocculated droplets. Robins has reported schematic diagrams of oil
volume fraction profiles during creaming.1 In the review, we can see that the fraction increases at once and
then decreases at a certain height range in the case of emulsions
where creaming of flocculated droplets occurs.

Interestingly,
the averaged time profile at 1 cm from the bottom
(Figure 4a) fluctuated
less than the averaged time profiles at 2 and 3 cm from the bottom
(Figure 4b,c). At higher
monitoring positions, the styrene droplets were rising from the lower
portion of the monitoring area. Therefore, the raw time profiles,
as shown in Figure 3b,c, show many intense spikes at all times. As a result, the averaged
time profiles were accompanied by relatively large fluctuations, although
they represent the average of three measurements.

Fitting Equation and Kinetics
Next, we devised a fitting
equation for the time profiles by applying two sigmoid functions.
A sigmoid function is a monotonous increasing function with finite
limits at negative infinity and infinity. In the present study, this
function was expected to fit a signal behavior at the position just
beneath the surface of a sample where the concentration of styrene
increased with time and finally settled at a certain value. In addition,
a monotonous decreasing function can be produced when a sigmoid function
is subtracted from a certain constant. This function also has finite
limits at negative infinity and infinity. In the present study, this
function was assumed to fit the signal behavior monitored near the
bottom of a sample where the concentration of styrene had decreased
with time and finally settled at a certain value.

In the present
study, the fit of the signal behavior that had increased once and
then decreased with time was attempted by the subtraction of two sigmoid
functions. The signal intensity of styrene, I, in
time, t, is expressed by the following equation.  

In that equation, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes
of each sigmoid function, a1 and a2 are the
slopes by the inflection point of each sigmoid function, and γ1 and γ2 are the times of the inflection points
of each sigmoid function.

The results of the fit for the time
profiles of the signal intensity
are also shown in Figure 4, and the calculated coefficients are indicated in Table 1. The software automatically
performed the calculations for fitting, with the exception of the
value of A1 for the monitoring position
1 cm from the bottom of the cuvette; a value of 1.2 was manually substituted;
otherwise, the fit did not accurately reflect the experimentally obtained
time profile.

Equation for the Time Profiles Shown in Figure 4

(cm)	A1	a1	γ1	A2	a2	γ2	R2

1	1.2a	1.5	0.9	0.76	0.4	7.2	0.9034	
a A1 at
1 cm from the bottom was manually substituted.

The fit was well expressed for the time profile at
the monitoring
position 1 cm from the bottom (a coefficient of determination: R2 = 0.9034). On the other hand, the values of R2 calculated from the monitoring positions of
2 and 3 cm were not necessarily high (0.7323 and 0.7707, respectively).
The fit was considered reasonable, however, and it should be noted
that there were many intense spikes on the raw time profiles, as shown
in Figure 3. These
spikes were particularly prominent at higher monitoring positions,
which resulted in large fluctuations in the averaged time profiles.

In Table 1, the
amplitudes A1 and A2 increased as the monitoring positions became higher. The
amplitude A1 in the first term of the
proposed fitting equation concerns the increase in the signal intensity
of styrene at a certain monitoring position assuming that its concentration
had not decreased. Thus, the concentration of styrene should be higher
as the monitoring position was higher. Therefore, the tendency of
the coefficient A1 with respect to the
monitoring position was considered appropriate.

The amplitude A2 in the second term
of the fitting equation concerns the decrease in the signal intensity
of styrene at a certain monitoring position. As with coefficient A1, the A2 obtained
in the present study increased as the monitoring position became higher.
These results suggest that the degrees of both the increase and decrease
in the signal intensity were larger as the monitoring position became
higher in the present study. Interestingly, the value of A1 – A2, which indicates
the signal intensity at which a sufficient amount of time has elapsed,
showed little difference between the results obtained at both 2 and
3 cm from the bottom. These results indicate that, though the change
in the degrees of the increase and the decrease was rather large at
the position 3 cm from the bottom, the final concentrations were almost
the same at both 2 and 3 cm. Incidentally, the value of A2 should decrease at a higher monitoring position because
once the concentration of styrene has increased, it is not easily
decreased.

In addition, the characteristic feature of the coefficient
γ2 is notable because it increased as the monitoring
position
was raised. The value of γ2 reflects the time of
the inflection point of the sigmoid function of the second term of
the fitting equation. The obtained tendency of γ2 indicates that the time needed for decreasing the signal intensity
of styrene should be prolonged as the sampling position is raised.
Incidentally, γ1 was also expected to show the same
tendency as γ2. However, the obtained values of γ1 were inaccurate because they were small compared with the
time interval between the plots (2 min) and, even further, because
the signal was first detected 2 min after the recording. In other
words, the rate of creaming at the point of an increase in the signal
intensity was considered to be too fast against the present experimental
conditions, which should be verified in future studies. For the same
reasons, the slope of a1 was also inappropriate
for evaluating the creaming behavior in the present study.

The
slope of a2 was the highest at
the monitoring position 2 cm from the bottom, that is, the middle
position in height. This tendency could be acceptable for the following
reasons. At a lower position of the sample, the concentration of styrene
should decrease without much of an increase. Therefore, there is the
possibility that the rate of decrease was smaller than that at the
middle position. In addition, the higher positions of the sample may
require more time to allow for a decrease in the concentration of
styrene. It is helpful to consider the highest position, that is,
the position just beneath the surface of a sample where the concentration
of styrene increases once, but then does not decrease at all. Such
behavior was apparent in the oil concentration profiles in the previous
review.1 Therefore, at higher positions,
it was assumed that the rate of the decrease would be small compared
with that at the middle position. Of course, the understood tendency
for a2 could be easily changed by any
of several factors that would include the ratio of oil and water.
In addition, a2 would be relative to the
dispersivity of the emulsion to be measured; polydispersed emulsions
probably indicate smaller values because the oil concentrations continuously
(gradually) change around the boundary between the upper and lower
layers, which is different from monodispersed emulsions where the
oil concentrations sharply change at the boundary.1 Particularly in polydispersed emulsions, the boundary is
ambiguous during creaming, and because of the turbidity, the boundary
is difficult either to visually confirm or be detected using UV–vis.
On the other hand, the present method using REMPI-TOFMS could surely
provide useful information about emulsions that undergo creaming behavior.

Conclusions
In the present study, different heights
of an emulsion displaying
the creaming phenomenon were directly measured by REMPI-TOFMS, and
a fitting of the time profiles of styrene peak areas was performed.
Using a fitting equation that consisted of subtracting two sigmoid
functions, we quantitatively evaluated the creaming behavior by indicating
coefficients such as the times for the continuance of high signal
intensities, which increased as the monitoring positions were raised
to higher levels. The creaming behavior changes easily, and the changes
are dependent on the characteristics of the individual samples and
on factors such as convection and vaporization. Therefore, it is important
to quantitatively evaluate the creaming phenomenon, and the method
proposed in the present study would be helpful for such an endeavor.
