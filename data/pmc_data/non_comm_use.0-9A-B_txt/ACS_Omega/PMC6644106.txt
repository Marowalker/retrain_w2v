Mesoporous carbon spheres (MCS-750,
MCS-800, MCS-850, MCS-900,
and MCS-950) have been synthesized by a facile strategy with low temperature
and rapid chemical vapor deposition technique. The synthesized MCS
possess relatively large surface area (570–670 m2 g–1), good graphitization, remarkable porosity,
and redox functionalities on the surface of the synthesized MCS. Combination
of these structural and surface properties of the synthesized MCS
as an electrode material (MCS-850) showed an excellent charge-storage
capacity with a specific capacitance of 338 F/g at 1 mV/s, 217 F/g
at 0.5 A/g. MCS-850 shows long-term cycling stability with capacitive
retention of more than 96% after 2000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
In addition, a fabricated two-electrode symmetric cell obtained 86%
retention after 2000 cycles. The two-electrode symmetric device exhibited
a specific capacitance of 63 F/g at 5 mV/s with an energy density
of 7.1 Wh/kg.

Introduction
Modern science and
technology uses porous carbon materials in various
fields such as water/air purification, separation, catalysis, and
energy storage.1−6 In energy-storage system, supercapacitors play a major role as they
have high power density, long life cycle, cost-effectiveness, and
eco-friendly properties compared to batteries.7−10 Based on the mechanism of energy
storage, supercapacitors are categorized as pseudocapacitors and electric
double-layer capacitors (EDLC). Pseudocapacitors involve reversible
redox or faradic charge-transfer reactions and use transition-metal
oxides11,12 and conducting polymers as electrodes.13,14 EDLC store energy by electrochemical charge accumulation occurring
at the electrode/electrolyte interface with porous carbon materials
as electrodes.15,16 Hence, the electrode material
becomes the deciding factor for the performance of supercapacitors.17 Among several electrode materials such as transition-metal
oxides, conducting polymers and carbon materials with various morphologies
are used due to their low cost, electrochemical stability, and superior
electrical conductivity. In particular, mesoporous carbon spheres
as electrode material improve the performance of supercapacitors due
to large electrochemically active surface area and pore size, which
facilitates easy access of electrolytic ions.18−22 The electrical conductivity of carbon material enables
superior performance of supercapacitors, which is associated with
the quantity of graphitization with sp2 hybridization.9,23 The chemical composition also contributes as a factor for supercapacitive
performance.

Transition-metal atoms like Ni, Co, and Fe are
used as catalyst
and mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41, SBA-15, and KIT-6
are used as catalytic support for the preparation of various nanostructured
materials such as CNTs, spheres, rods, wires, and CMK by employing
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique.24−30 Among the mesoporous molecular sieves, KIT-6 are potential candidates
since they possess higher surface area to anchor, good dispersion
of metal catalyst, and bidirectional pore modal to facilitate the
reactants with the catalyst in mass level, which are the advantages
of MCS growth with high yield. Carrasco et al.31 reported the synthesis of carbon spheres by CVD technique
using NiFe-LDHs as catalyst for supercapacitor application with large
reaction time, i.e., they used to feed the carbon source for 1 h.
Although the carbon spheres possess higher conductivity, there is
a lack in surface area. Rajagopal et al.25 reported the synthesis of graphene bubbles with spherelike morphology
by CVD technique using metal-supported MCM-41 for supercapacitor application
with a high reaction temperature of 900 °C.

In this work,
we report for the first time the synthesis of mesoporous
carbon spheres (MCS) using novel Fe-KIT-6 by simple CVD technique,
which involves simple synthetic strategy, low reaction temperature,
and less reaction time compared to the previous reported results.25,31 In this technique, acetylene is employed as carbon source, which
was fed only for 30 min at 750, 800, 850, 900, and 950 °C to
synthesize MCS. Hence, we report a simple synthetic strategy to prepare
MCS with relatively high surface area and good conductivity. The supercapacitive
performance of synthesized MCS as electrode material was found to
be possess superior electrochemical performance with specific capacitance
of 338 F/g and long-term cyclic stability with more than 96% capacitive
retention after 2000 cycles in 6 M KOH. In addition, a two-electrode
symmetric cell was fabricated using MCS-850 sample and obtained 86%
capacitive retention after 2000 cycles.

Results and Discussion
The growth of MCS was achieved by means of a simple CVD technique
at 750, 800, 850, 900, and 950 °C using Fe-KIT-6 molecular sieves
as catalytic support and acetylene as carbon source for a period of
30 min.

The Si/Fe ratio of hydrothermally synthesized mesoporous
Fe-KIT-6
molecular sieve was estimated using inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and the results are given in Table 1. The Si/Fe ratio
derived from the elemental analysis was nearly close to the gel composition
as noted in the Fe-KIT-6 material. The results indicated that almost
all of the metals employed during the synthesis were successfully
incorporated into mesoporous materials. The small-angle powder XRD
(SAXRD) pattern of mesoporous Fe-KIT-6 is shown in Figure 1a. It can be seen that the
high intense peak exhibited by Fe-KIT-6 at 2θ = 0.9° was
due to (211) reflection, shoulder peak at 1.1° due to (220) reflection,
and the weak peaks between 1.5 and 2.2° due to (321), (400),
(420), (332), (422) and (431) reflections, indicating the formation
of well-ordered mesoporous materials with the symmetry of the body-centered
cubic Ia3d space group, which was
in agreement with the reported mesoporous KIT-6 materials.32 The lattice parameter was estimated from the
SAXRD spectrum of Fe-KIT-6 using the formulaa0 = d211(6)1/2, and
the value is shown in Table 1. Also we have obtained lattice parameter of the Fe-KIT-6
from TEM of about 21.65 nm, which was almost close to SAXS. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure S2d) was used to calculate the d-spacing
to obtain a0 value.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size
distribution of Fe-KIT-6 molecular sieve are shown in Figure 1b. As shown in Figure 1b, type IV isotherm with pronounced
capillary condensation step at high relative pressure and H1 hysteresis
loop indicates well-ordered mesoporous materials with large channel-like
pores.33 The BET surface area, pore size,
and pore volume of Fe-KIT-6 are listed in Table 1. The pore-size distribution of mesoporous
Fe-KIT-6 molecular sieve was calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method, as shown in the inset of Figure 1b, which appears narrow and peak centered
at about 6.62 nm.

The surface morphology of Fe-KIT-6 was investigated
by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The spongelike porous nature and
agglomeration of random particles without a defined shape are shown
in Figure 2a,b. The
mesoporous structure of the Fe-KIT-6 catalyst was investigated by
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis,
as shown in Figure 2c,d. The HRTEM images revealed well-ordered arrays with regular 3D
pore structure and fine distribution of Fe nanoparticles (as indicated
by the arrow in Figure 2d) inside the pores of the 3D mesoporous KIT-6 framework. It confirmed
the presence of large domains of a 3D silica–iron network,
which highlights the interconnectivity in the pore structure of the Ia3d cubic phase. The HRTEM images of Fe-KIT-6
are presented as supporting data with a clear 3D cubic structure in Figure S2a,b, in which we could not find any
stripes but honey combs. The enlarged HRTEM image (Figure S2c inset) shows the average pore size obtained from
N2 adsorption/desorption.

The wide-angle XRD patterns
of MCS samples prepared at 750, 800,
850, 900, and 950 °C were recorded to study the graphitic nature
of the materials. Figure 3a represents the wide-angle XRD patterns of MCS-750, MCS-800,
and MCS-850 samples only. The XRD patterns of MCS-900 and MCS-950
samples are produced as supporting results in Figure S3. As shown in Figure 3a, the XRD pattern for all samples exhibited two well-resolved
diffraction peaks with 2θ ranges of about 25.4–25.8 and
42.9–43.4°, which can be indexed to (002) and (100) diffractions
of typical graphite carbon materials, respectively.34 However, the broadness of diffraction peaks of the MCS
suggested a less long range of structural order in the graphitic plane.35 According to Bragg’s law, the interlayer
spacings d002 of MCS were 0.347, 0.348,
0.349, 0.349, and 0.347 nm for MCS synthesized at 750, 800, 850, 900,
and 950 °C, respectively. The values were nearly close and slightly
higher than that of the pure graphitic carbon (0.335 nm), which indicated
that the MCS consists of relatively well-graphitized carbon structure.23,31

patterns (a) and Raman spectrum (b) of MCS synthesized at 750,
800, and 850 °C.

Raman spectroscopy is one of the powerful tools for the characterization
of MCS (Figure 3b).
In the figure, the D and G bands observed at about 1335 and 1580 cm–1, respectively, are characteristic bands of carbon
materials. The former, corresponding to defect-induced band, attributed
to the structural defects in hexagonal graphene plane.

The latter
corresponds to an in-plane E2g mode of graphitic
layers, i.e., the vibration of sp2-bonded carbon atoms
in hexagonal graphite.36,37 The graphitization of carbon
materials can be confirmed by ID/IG value. The ID/IG values of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 are
0.78, 0.80, and 0.89, respectively. The ID/IG values of <1 obtained in our case
suggests that the MCS were well-graphitized carbon structures.38 The ID/IG ratio increased with increasing reaction temperature
in CVD technique, which is in accordance with the previously reported
results.39

The morphology and microstructure
of MCS synthesized at 750, 800,
and 850 °C were investigated by SEM and HRTEM, respectively.
The SEM images of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples are displayed
in Figure 4a–c.
As shown in Figure 4a–c, all samples revealed nearly uniform formation of spherelike
morphology and the increase in temperature favored the formation of
spheres with high yield, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, respectively.

and (c) MCS-850.

The yield
of MCS-750 prepared at 750 °C is 62.5%, which is
comparatively low; on increasing the reaction temperature up to 850
°C, the yield increased rapidly (174%). But beyond 850 °C,
the yield of MCS-900 prepared even at 900 °C is only 137.5%,
which clearly shows that the yield of MCS beyond 850 °C begins
to gradually decrease.

Some of the spheres are accreted and
form a chainlike structure,
in agreement with previous reports.40,41 The morphological
analyses of MCS-900 and MCS-950 samples were also carried out using
SEM tool, and their SEM images are presented in Figure S4. The samples MCS-900 and MCS-950 also retained similar
morphology to the MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples. Further,
the microstructural study of MCS was conducted by HRTEM analysis. Figure 5a1–a2,b1–b2,c1–c2
shows the HRTEM images of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples at
different magnifications present to be of nearly perfect sphere with
hollow structure and average size range of 810, 780, and 750 nm, respectively.
The wall thickness of each carbon sphere was almost uniform, i.e.,
about 90 nm. In general, this kind of hollow structures could be indicated
by the dark edge and pale core in HRTEM images. It is clearly shown
in the HRTEM images given in Figure 5 itself that all of them have graphitic nature. The
already proposed probable formation mechanism of MCS found only uniform
MCS in resultant yields, indicating that C2H2 may play a crucial role in the formation of hollow-structured MCS.
At the time of MCS preparation, some carbon feedstock are composed
of basic structural units (BSUs). It has been reported in ref (42) that the gas/solid interface
usually results in a texture of the sphere due to the random arrangement
of the BSUs, which leads to the formation of sphere shape morphology
with hollow structures. Moreover, the interlayer distances between
layers were 0.347 (Figure 5a3), 0.348 (Figure 5b3), and 0.349 nm (Figure 5c3) for the MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples,
respectively. The obtained results from XRD, Raman, and HRTEM studies
were concurrent about the graphitic structure of MCS.

Recently, Carrasco et al.31 and
Jian-Ying
Miao et al.43 have reported that the probable
formation mechanism of spherical carbon structures. We proposed a
probable formation mechanism of MCSs, and its schematic representation
is shown in Figure 6. In general, Fe particles can be incorporated in the walls of the
mesoporous KIT-6 molecular sieves. As this 3D cubic KIT-6 stabilizes
dispersed catalytic ions, its structural stability seems to be good.

Figure 6 Probable
formation mechanism of MCSs.

The bidirectional and uniform pore system of KIT-6 made them
well
adapted for excellent catalytic supports. The factors such as nature
of catalytic supports, reaction temperature, and transition-metal
nanoparticles desired the growth of MCSs. In this attempt, Fe nanoparticles
were well embedded in the 3D cubic mesoporous KIT-6 molecular sieves.
In general, the transition-metal nanoparticles are seeds for the growth
of carbon nanotubes/spheres. The continuous separation from the acetylene
decomposition and deposition of graphitic carbon led to the formation
of perfect carbon spheres.

The carbon radicals became good sphere-shaped
carbons when C2H2 gas entered the CVD setup
at a particular temperature
(reaction temperature). One of the factors for the formation of MCSs
temperature revealed that growth of MCSs was not observed at temperature
less than 750 °C. This was obvious that appropriate sintering
of the metal catalyst was necessary for the growth of MCSs. Then,
further increase of temperature from 750 to 950 °C favors the
formation of spheres. It is also observed that carbon deposition increased
with increasing reaction temperatures. The optimized temperature was
found to be 850 °C, and further increase in temperature (to 900
and 950 °C) decreased the yield. The amount of deposition of
MCSs was higher at 850 °C and lower at 750 °C (Table 2). Anyway, a precise
role of the catalyst used in the growth of carbon spheres by CVD protocols
is still not revealed completely.

The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms and the pore-size
distribution curves of the MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 are shown
in Figure 7a,b. All
of the samples exhibited type IV isotherms, obvious condensation step,
and significant hysteresis loops at high relative pressure P/P0 = 0.4–0.9, which
indicated the existence of a large number of mesopores.44−46 The pore-size distribution (PSD) of the MCS was calculated using
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption
branches of isotherms, as shown in Figure 7b. This showed that the size of mesopores
in the MCS were around 3–4 nm (centered on 3.66, 2.86, and
3.11 nm for MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850, respectively). Such uniform
mesopores with relatively high surface area were expected to provide
sufficient charge-storage space for high specific capacitance and
efficient ion-transfer path. The BET surface area, pore size, and
pore volume of MCS are listed in Table 3.

Moreover, high-resolution XPS technique was used to
analyze the
chemical composition and surface functional groups on the surface
of the prepared carbon materials with the atomic percentage of the
surface elements summarized in Table 3. The survey scan spectra in Figure 8a showed that the MCS contained only carbon
and oxygen peaks at binding energies of about 284.7 and 533.4 eV,
respectively, which suggested that the purification process removed
Fe and Si of the catalytic support completely.

MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples (a) and curve
fit of the C 1s peaks of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 (b).

The XPS image of MCS in Figure 8b further demonstrated
the electronic states of the
surface elements. The C 1s XPS images can be deconvoluted into four
individual peaks: the main peak observed at around 284.7 eV was assigned
to C–C group, while the other three peaks at around 286.6,
288.4, and 290.1 eV can be assigned to the C–O, C=O,
and O–C=O groups, respectively.31,46,47 The potential oxygen functional groups on
MCS enhance the electrochemical activity and contribute to the faradic
redox process occurring on the carbon surface.48 Comparatively, MCS-850 delivered more number of C–O
(286.6 eV) groups, as indicated in Figure 8b, with high intensity. We ascribed the enhanced
capacitance to the oxygen functionalities, particularly pyrone-like
(C–O) groups. We illustrated the difference in oxygen content
from the XPS results. And those estimated different oxygen functionalities
are listed in Table S1. The relative intensities
(in %) of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 samples for C–O functionalities
are 13, 16.6, and 30%, respectively. We could observe more than two
times C–O functionalities in the MCS-850 sample among other
samples.

The supercapacitor performances of the purified carbon
materials
(MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850) were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry,
galvanostatic charging/discharging, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy measurements in 6 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode
system. Figure 9a shows
the CV curves of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 electrodes at a scan
rate of 50 mV/s between −1.0 and 0 V in 6 M KOH electrolyte,
which exhibited rectangular-like trends with broad humps indicating
the composite capacitance performance by combination of EDLC and pseudocapacitance.
It was attributed to the redox reaction of the oxygen functionalities
on the surface of the MCS.31,49,50

Figure 9 CV
curves of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 at a scan rate of 50
mV/s (a); GCD curves of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 at 1 A/g (b);
CV curves of MCS-850 at various scan rates (c); and GCD curves of
MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850 at various current densities (d).

Moreover, the humps are more pronounced
in the case of MCS-850
than MCS-750 and MCS-800 with increased amount oxygen and its functionalities
(C–O, C=O, and O–C=O), particularly pyrone-like
(C–O) groups with high intensity, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 8b. It may be due to the presence of reactive
dangling bonds on carbon surface as a result of accretion effect of
MCS-850 sample.35 Those pyrone-like functionalities
are more electrochemically active in KOH electrolyte.48,51 Due to this redox and EDLC process, the CV curve of MCS-850 electrode
exhibited larger CV area and a higher specific capacitance of 338
F/g than MCS-750 (235 F/g) and MCS-800 (251 F/g). The specific capacitance
(Csp) of the MCS-750, MCS-800, MCS-850,
MCS-900, and MCS-950 electrodes from CV curves is calculated according
to eq 1(52) 1  where I is the current density
(mA/g), ΔV represents the potential window
(V), ϑ is the scan rate (mV/s), and m is the
mass of the MCS (g). Figure 9c shows the CV curves of MCS-850 electrode at various scan
rates, demonstrating no drastic distortion in the voltammogram even
if scan rate increased up to 100 mV/s, indicating good electrolyte
diffusion and efficient charge-transfer behavior at high charge and
discharge rate, which could be due to well-developed mesoporosity
and chainlike morphology that favors the fast access of electrolyte
ions within the porous carbon spheres.45

CV curves of MCS-750 and MCS-800 at various scan rates are
also
shown in Figure S5a,b. Moreover, the specific
capacitance of the MCS-850 electrode obtained from CV curve could
be compared to the published reports for carbon spheres synthesized
by CVD and other techniques mentioned in Table 4. To further investigate the electrochemical
performance and charge-storage capacity of the synthesized MCS, the
GCD measurement was carried out. Figure 9b shows the GCD curves of MCS-750, MCS-800,
and MCS-850 electrodes within the potential window of −1.0–0
V at a current density of 1 A/g.

The GCD curves of all of the
samples deviated from regular triangular
shape to a certain extent, which further demonstrated that faradic
redox reactions occurred on the MCS surface during the charge/discharge
process, which was consistent with CV analysis. Figure 9d shows the GCD curves of MCS-850 at the
current density range of 0.5–10 A/g. With the increase in the
current density, the triangular shape was closer to the ideal isosceles
triangle, suggesting the superior supercapacitive performance at high
current density. The GCD curves for MCS-750 and MCS-800 are also given
in Figure S5c,d. The specific capacitance
of MCS was calculated from the GCD curves using eq 2(52) 2  where I is the discharge
current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s),
ΔV is the potential window (V). and m is the mass (g) of the active materials in the working
electrode. The derived specific capacitance of optimized MCS-850 from
GCD curve using eq 2 was
217 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Moreover, we have also compared the specific capacitance
of MCS-850 with commercial carbon, which is higher than that of commercial
carbon sphere (2 F/g at 0.2 A/g).61

GCD curves of MCS-900 (c) and MCS-950 (d) at various current densities,
and specific capacitance vs scan rate of MCS-900 (e) and MCS-950 (f)
are displayed in Figure S6. Both the MCS-900
and MCS-950 samples also present rectangle-like shape with smoothened
hump, which indicated that the combined effect of EDLC and pseudocapacitor
performance. The specific capacitances of MCS-900 and MCS-950 are
189 and 151 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s and 54 and 51 F/g at a scan
rate of 100 mV/s, respectively. The specific capacitance values of
MCS-900 and MCS-950 electrodes are provided in Table S2 using CV and GCD measurements. It is believed that
the electrolyte allowed penetrating at low scan rate into pores more
thoroughly and to make greater contact with internal surface of the
electrode material and hence yield larger specific capacitance. At
higher scan rates, it delivered lower specific capacitance due to
insufficient time for electrolyte diffusion and adsorption process.
These results can be seen in Figure S6e for MCS-900 and Figure S6f for MCS-950
samples.

It was also found that the increase in reaction temperatures
from
750 to 850 °C results in the increase in oxygen functionalities
and oxygen contents on the surface of MCSs due to which we claimed
that the MCS-850 sample exhibited a better capacitive performance
than the other samples. But unfortunately, we found lower capacitive
behavior with further increase in reaction temperature beyond 850–950
°C, as evidenced by EDX analysis. The EDX micrographs are shown
in Figure 10a–e. Table 5 represents EDX spectra
of MCS synthesized at various temperatures and their corresponding
carbon and oxygen contents in weight (%).

To further demonstrate the excellent
capacitive performance of
the MCS-850, EIS was carried out. The Nyquist plots of MCS-750, MCS-800,
and MCS-850 electrodes are shown in Figure 11a. The semicircle in the high-frequency
region provides charge-transport resistances at electrode/electrolyte
interfaces (Rct1). The intersect of the
semicircle arcs in the real axis provides charge-transport resistances.
In addition, the high-frequency intercept at real axis provides the
solution or series resistance (Rs). From Table S3, it is noted that series resistance Rs seems to be same for all of the samples due
to the surface resistance of nickel foam used in the analysis. From Table S3, it is noted that the Rct value of MCS-850 (0.69 Ω) is much lower than
that of MCS-750 (1.96 Ω) and MCS-800 (2.59 Ω). It could
be related to its well-developed porosity and electrochemically active
functionalities on the surface that tend to render the interface between
the electrolyte and the electrode material an efficient charge transportation.
In the low-frequency region, MCS-850 exhibited a nearly vertical line
parallel to imaginary axis, which implies better capacitive behavior
than MCS-750 and MCS-800. The existence of Warburg-type impedance
further confirms the fast diffusion of ions in it. Figure 11b demonstrates the relationship
between specific capacitance and current density. It is noted that
the specific capacitance gradually decreased when the current density
increases from 0.5 to 2 A/g. However, the capacitance was maintained
well even at a high current density (2–10 A/g) in the range
of 114–100 F/g for MCS-850, 60–20 F/g for MCS-800, and
32–10 F/g for MCS-750.

Figure 11 EIS (a), current density vs specific
capacitance (b), and scan
rates vs specific capacitance (c) of MCS-750, MCS-800, and MCS-850
and cycling test of MCS-850 (d).

The excellent rate capability of MCS-850 was owing to the
existence
of suitable mesoporous structure, which provides shorter ionic diffusion
distance and rapid mass-transport path.45 The change in specific capacitance as a function of scan rate is
shown in Figure 11c. It can be clearly revealed that as the scan rate increases, specific
capacitance decreases. Consequently, it can be seen that the CV delivered
larger capacitance at lower scan rates, while smaller capacitance
at higher scan rates. It is believed that the electrolyte allowed
penetrating at low scan rate into pores more thoroughly and to make
greater contact with internal surface of the electrode material and
hence yield larger specific capacitance. At higher scan rates, it
delivered lower specific capacitance due to insufficient time for
electrolyte diffusion and adsorption process.

Cycling performance
was another important factor in determining
the supercapacitance of electrode for many practical applications.
The cycling stability of MCS-850 electrode was tested using GCD cycling
at a current density of 2 A/g, as shown in Figure 11d. At the end of 2000 cycles, the specific
capacitance was almost same with minor loss, retaining nearly 96%
of capacitance, which indicated good cycling performance.

The
two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated and tested
in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The image of the manufactured two-electrode
cell is embedded in Table S4. The specific
capacitances of the two-electrode symmetric cell calculated by CV
method using eq 1 and
by GCD method using eq 3 are listed in Table S4. 3  where I is the discharge
current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), m is the mass of the active material in a single electrode
(g), and ΔV is the potential difference (V).
It is well known that the energy density of supercapacitor depends
on the square of potential window (eq 4). A significant improvement in energy and power density
can be obtained if the cell can operate at larger potential range.
For that, we tried to improve cell voltage of prepared symmetric supercapacitor
as follows. Figure S7a,b reveals the CV
and GCD curves of the symmetric cell at various potential windows.
When the cell voltage increased from −0.8 to 1.0 V, the CV
curves still retained their nearly quasi-rectangular shape, which
is indicative of good capacitive and reversibility behavior. However,
while the voltage increased from −0.8 to 1.2 V, the current
increased rapidly because the electrolyte was being decomposed. Therefore,
the potential window of 1.8 V was selected to evaluate the electrochemical
performance of the symmetric cell.

Figure 12a demonstrates
the typical CV curves of the symmetric cell of MCS-850 electrode at
different scan rates from 5 to 100 mV/s with the potential window
of −0.8 to 1.0 V. The CV curves showed a quasi-rectangular
shape, which seems to be the combination of EDLC, and pseudocapacitive
behaviors confirmed the contribution of pseudocapacitance, which is
derived from the surface oxygen functional groups. Moreover, the shape
of the CV curves did not change even at a high scan rate of 100 mV/s,
exhibiting excellent rate capability and fast ion transportation.
The GCD curves in Figure 12b show a nearly triangular shape, suggesting good electrochemical
charge and discharge reversibility. Furthermore, the calculated specific
capacitance values of the symmetric cell (MCS-850 used as electrode)
from CV and GCD curves are listed in Table S3.

Figure 12 CV curves of symmetric cell at different scan rates (a) and GCD
curves at various current densities (b), specific capacitance vs scan
rate of symmetric cell (c), and cyclic stability test at 1 A/g (d).

Figure 12c shows
that the specific capacitance of fabricated symmetric cell as a function
of scan rate. The specific capacitances of 63 and 48 F/g were obtained
at scan rates of 5 and 100 mV/s, respectively. The difference in specific
capacitance found between 63 and 48 F/g is comparatively low, demonstrating
good rate capability. The cycling performance of symmetric two-electrode
cell was tested for about 2000 continuous cycles at a current density
of 1 A/g between −0.8 and 1.0 V, using the GCD method, and
is displayed in Figure 12d. After 2000 cycles, the capacitive retention of MCS-850
remained about 86% of the initial capacitance. This cyclic stability
test illustrates that the MCS-850 electrode has a significant cycling
stability behavior. We also calculated the energy density (Wh/kg)
and power density (W/kg) using eqs 4 and 5. The Ragone plot for two-electrode
symmetric cell in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte is presented in Figure 13, showing that
the high specific energy density of the cell was 7.1 Wh/kg, which
delivered a power density of 277 W/kg. This result is higher and comparable
to that of the previously reported carbon-based symmetric supercapacitor
in aqueous electrolyte.62,63 4   5  where Csp is the
specific capacitance (F/g), ΔV is the potential
window (Vmax–IR drop), and Δtd is the discharge time (s).

Figure 13 Ragone plot of two-electrode
symmetric cell.

The outstanding capacitive
performance of the MCS electrodes in
6 M KOH electrolyte may be ascribed to the following aspects: (i)
the relatively high surface area with well-developed mesoporosity,
which favored accessibility of electrolytic ions for large amount
of charge storage; (ii) the graphitic nature of MCS for improved electronic
conductivity; and (iii) the redox functionalities on the MCS surface,
which brought pseudocapacitance due to the faradic redox reactions
and improved its wettability, which enhanced the utilization efficiency
of the surface area.

Conclusions
Mesoporous carbon spheres
have been successfully synthesized by
CVD technique using novel Fe-KIT-6 as catalytic support. The obtained
MCS had relatively high specific surface area of 570–670 m2/g, remarkable porosity with average pore diameter of 3.6–3.11
nm, good graphitization, and redox functionalities on the surface
of MCS. As an electrode material (denoted as MCS-850) for supercapacitor,
these structural characteristics and surface property endow this mesoporous
carbon material with high specific capacitances of 338 F/g at 1 mV/s
and 217 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and a good cycling stability
with capacitive retention of more than 96% after 2000 cycles in 6
M KOH electrolyte. The carefully fabricated two-electrode symmetric
device exhibited a specific capacitance of 63 F/g at 5 mV/s with an
energy density of 7.1 Wh/kg. The present technique has become the
simple synthetic strategy to obtain MCS without compromising their
electrode properties and exhibits superior supercapacitance. The high
specific capacitance along with the excellent cycling stability of
MCS can lead to a promising electrode material for advanced energy-storage
devices in future.

Experimental Procedures
Synthesis of Mesoporous
Fe-KIT-6 Molecular Sieves
All
of the reagents were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water was used
in all of the experiments. The mesoporous 3D cubic Fe-KIT-6 was prepared
hydrothermally using a gel composition of TEOS:0.017 P123:1.83 HCl:1.31 n-BuOH:195H2O. The typical synthetic procedure
for Fe-KIT-6(75) is as follows: 4 g of P123 was added to the mixture
of solution containing 144 mL of distilled water and 7.9 g of 35%
w/w HCl solution and stirred at 35 °C for complete dissolution. n-Butanol (4 g) was added to the above mixture and stirred
for an hour at 35 °C. Subsequently, 8.6 g of silica source (TEOS)
and a desired amount of iron source were added to the above homogeneous
solution and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 35 °C. The mixture
was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h in
a closed polypropylene bottle under static conditions. The obtained
white precipitate was filtered, dried at 100 °C for 8 h, and
calcined for 5 h at 550 °C in air.

Synthesis and Purification
of Mesoporous Carbon Spheres
MCS was synthesized by the CVD
technique using Fe-KIT-6 as catalytic
support. A simple CVD horizontal tube furnace setup containing quartz
tube (45 mm i.d., and 960 mm long) and gas flow control units (Figure S1) was used to produce MCS. In a typical
experiment, about 200 mg of Fe-KIT-6 was placed in a quartz boat inside
a quartz tube. Argon gas was purged to the catalyst at a flow rate
of 100 SCCM (SCCM – standard cubic centimeter per minute) for
30 min to remove water molecules, i.e., pretreated catalyst, and hydrogen
gas was purged at a flow rate of 110 SCCM for 30 min to reduce the
metal particles. The reaction was carried out using acetylene as the
carbon source at 750, 800, 850, 900, and 950 °C at a flow rate
of 100 SCCM for 30 min. The furnace was cooled to ambient temperature
under argon atmosphere. The black powder collected from the quartz
boat was weighed, purified, and then used to further characterization
studies. The catalytic decomposing of acetylene was calculated in
terms of percentage of the carbon deposition by eq 6. 6  where mtot is
the total mass of carbon product and catalyst and mcat is the mass of catalytic support.

The as-synthesized
materials were treated with 40% HF (hydrofluoric acid) solution to
remove the Si phase. The obtained sample was treated with HCl solution
to remove Fe particles and washed with deionized water repeatedly
and dried. After drying, the sample was oxidized at 400 °C for
2 h in atmospheric air to remove carbonaceous impurities like microcrystalline
carbon and amorphous carbon to yield the final mesoporous carbon spheres,
which were designated as MCS-750, MCS-800, MCS-850, MCS-900, and MCS-950.
After purification, the percentage of the MCSs on the mass of the
catalytic support was also calculated by eq 7, and the values are listed in Table 2. 7  where WMCS is
the weight of the MCS after purification (in mg) and Wcat is the weight of the catalyst in mg.

Structural
Characterizations
Inductive coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer OPTIMA 3000) was used
to determine the amount of metal loading into KIT-6. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern was recorded with PANalytical X’Pert diffractometer
equipped with liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium solid-state detector
using Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEM-5600LV)
was used to analyze surface morphology. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded with a JEOL JEM 2100
electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Raman measurements were carried
out using a laser Raman microscope-RAMAN 11i with 532 nm line of an
Ar ion laser as an excitation source. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm measurement was performed at 77 K with a Quanta chrome Instrument.
The specific surface area (SSA) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation. The pore-size distribution (PSD) was measured by the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption
branches of the isotherms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was employed on XPS-Omicron Nanotechnologies.

Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical experiments
were carried out in electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT) using
a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The three-electrode
cell was assembled with the prepared MCS cast on precleaned Ni foam,
which acts as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode,
and saturated Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. The working
electrode was prepared as follows: the prepared MCS (80%), carbon
black (10%), and PVDF (10%) were mixed with a few drops of dimethylformamide
(DMF) using agate mortar to get a paste. The resulting paste was cast
into a precleaned nickel foam and pressed at 10 MPa pressure. The
as-prepared working electrode was dried overnight at 80 °C. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging/discharging (GCD), and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were employed for the measurements
of electrochemical performance. The CV and GCD measurements were performed
with a potential window between −1.0 and 0 V at different scan
rates from 1 to 100 mV/s and current densities from 0.5 to 10 A/g.
EIS was conducted in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with
5 mV AC amplitude at the open-circuit potential.

Fabrication
of Two-Electrode Symmetric Device
The two-electrode
symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated and tested in 6 M KOH aqueous
electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by mixing carbon as
active material (MCS-850), carbon black as conductive medium, and
PVDF as binder in a weight ratio of 8:1:1, respectively. The above
mixture was ground for half an hour. After grinding, the resulting
paste of electrode materials in equal amount was pressed at 10 MPa
pressure separately on two cleaned Ni foam current collectors as anode
and cathode. The prepared wet electrodes were kept at 80 °C overnight.
After drying, the device was fabricated carefully using a Whatman
filter paper as a separator and a few drops of KOH electrolyte.
