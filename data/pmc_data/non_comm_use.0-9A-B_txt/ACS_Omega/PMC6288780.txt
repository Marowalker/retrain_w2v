Toward the development of the smart
biosensing drug carrier, integration
of dye molecules with polymeric chain has been an emerging method
in recent years. In this perspective, dipyridamole (Dip)-based branched
poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and branched polycaprolactone (PCL)
have been synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. After polymerization,
the influence of the polyester chains on the Dip emission behavior
has been studied systematically in this work. Dip–PLLA has
undergone C=O···N=C interaction in ground
stage, leading to intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state.
Limited availability of the C=O in PCL chains resists such
interactions with Dip molecule. So, this structural availability of
the C=O group in the polymeric chains influences the color
change between Dip–PLLA (green fluorescence) and Dip–PCL
(blue fluorescence). To visualize the biosensing ability of Dip–PLLA
and Dip–PCL, hollow microspheres have been prepared by the
double-emulsion solvent evaporation method, and the prepared microspheres
cells uptake has been visualized by fluorescence imaging.

1 Introduction
Biocompatible
fluorescence dyes have become attractive materials
in recent years due to their widespread application as biosensors
and biomarkers due to their tracking behavior. This fluorescence dye
tracking property has several advantages over traditional methods,
such as radiation-free nature, high sensitivity, and specificity toward
target detection with the low concentration of chromophores.1−4 The fluorescent biomarker or dye along with magnetic particles,
monoclonal antibody, DNA, and drug needs to fabricate drug carriers
to improve the performance.5 At the same
time, multiple compounds fabrication is a complicated process.6 To simplify the process, Zhang and co-workers
first introduced the multifluorescence core into mesoporous silica
as a trackable drug carrier.7 The single
drug carrier molecule that integrates multifunctional application
is cost-effective.8

The photophysical
properties of the dyes can be influenced by many
factors such as temperature,9,10 pH,11,12 solvent polarity,13 and physical interaction
between the chromophores.14,15 Several groups demonstrated
that the physical blending structure of polymer chains influences
the photophysical properties of the dye.16,17 Recently, researchers have found that the covalent attachment of
the dye molecule with a polymeric chain has more advantages than physical
bending. Asha and co-workers reported that the covalent attachment
of the oligo(p-phenylene vinylene)-2-diol with poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) leads to helicity transformation from the
polymeric chain to oligo(phenylene vinylene).18,19 Hong’s group observed that crystalline phases enhance the
emission behavior, which specified as crystallization-enhanced emission
with the covalent bonding of the salicylideneazine molecule with PLLA.20 Tang and co-workers21 eliminated the “π–π” stacking of
tetraphenylethylene (TPE) by covalent attachment of polyester chains
and obtained aggregation-induced emission19 in the solid state. Very recently, they have demonstrated the temperature-dependent
on/off emission behavior of TPE end-caped polycaprolactone (PCL).9 Many interesting studies have been carried out
with dye end-capped polymers, but few studies focused on the physical
interaction of the polymeric chain with the dye molecules and its
influence on the emission behavior. It is worth exploring the interaction
science and the emission behavior between fluorescent dye and the
different polymeric chains.

Therefore, in this present work,
we focus on the study of the emission
of Dip in different polyester environments using Dip–PLLA and
Dip–PCL. Due to their excellent biodegradable and biocompatible
properties, both PLLA and PCL have often been considered as the ideal
candidate for polymeric drug carriers. It is expected that this study
will promote the role that polymeric chains play on the emission behavior
of biopolymer–dye macromolecules. Parallelly, we demonstrate
the fluorescence-sensing ability of the fluorescence emissive hollow
microspheres of Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL as drug carriers
in the in vitro environment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of the Polymer Chain Interaction
with Dipyridamole on the Photophysical Properties
Dip–PLLA
and Dip–PCL were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization
using Dip as a co-initiator along with Sn(II)Oct2. The
molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity
index of Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL are 53 kDa and 1.35 and
46 kDa and 1.3, respectively. During polymerization, the emissive
Dip molecule acts as a four-arm initiator along with Sn(II)Oct2 and exists as an isolated entity on the branched polymer
matrix. Dip is a well-studied green fluorescent compound with an emission
maximum observed at 500 nm. It exhibits a good solution-state emission
efficiency with Φ = 17% (Table 1), compared to the film state Φ = 2%, which indicates
that at higher concentration or in solid state, Dip molecules undergo
π–π stacking between the neighboring aromatic pyrimido
pyrimidine rings,22,23 which leads to aggregation-caused
quenching from the emissive excited state.

During polymerization, the chain rigidity of the polymeric
matrix
will lead to eliminating π–π interactions between
the neighboring Dip molecules.21 The structures
of Dip, Dip–PLLA, and Dip–PCL are given in Figure 1a along with the
photographs of Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL polymer films under
UV excitation (365 nm) and daylight. These photographs indicate the
color difference of green fluorescence and blue fluorescence between
Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL in the excited state. The thin-film
measurements of absorption and emission are given in Figure 1b. Even though the core molecule
responsible for the fluorescence is the same, the difference in their
emission color can be related to the difference in the steric situation
of acceptor and the available acceptor concentration (−C=O)
in the polymeric chain around the chromophore as well as the rigidity
of the polymer matrix. Moreover, the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) curves (Figure S1) for Dip–PLLA
and Dip–PCL exhibit glass-transition temperatures (Tg’s) of 60 and −40 °C, respectively.
The vast difference in the Tg pointed
out that the Dip–PLLA chains are much more rigid than the Dip–PCL
chains. The red-shifted emission in Dip–PLLA can be attributed
to the C=O···N=C interaction and rigid
environment in the ground state and the usual process excited state
with charge-transfer (CT) character, such as intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT).

and emission spectra of Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL thin films.

Intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) is a natural energy migration
process, which takes place within the molecules that consist of both
acceptor and donor functional groups separated in a microenvironment.
Upon excitation, the charge transfer from donor to acceptor takes
place in the excited state, which may produce a new charge-transfer
(CT) excited state.24−27 The structure of dipyridamole consists of three different nitrogen
atoms in the form of diethanolamines, piperidine rings, and aromatic
pyrimido pyrimidine center. Viard et al. proved that the amino and
carbonyl groups could act as an electron donor and acceptor groups,
respectively.28 The possibility of interaction
between the aromatic pyrimido pyrimidine rings and the carbonyl groups
of the ester moiety from the polymer chains cannot be neglected. The
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded and compared
to Dip, Dip-loaded as well as Dip-unloaded PCL and PLLA polymer films,
and are shown in Figure 2. The peak at 1533 cm–1 corresponds to the N=C
ring of the Dip. The polymers without Dip (PCL and PLLA) do not have
such peaks in this region. In the case of Dip and Dip–PCL,
both do not have much difference in the aromatic pyrimido pyrimidine
ring-based N=C vibrational peak (1533 cm–1). At the same time, in Dip–PLLA, the N=C peak clearly
shows a deviation from 1533 to 1511 cm–1 compared
to Dip and Dip–PCL. The peak deviation at 1533 cm–1 confirms the interaction of C=O···N=C
in Dip–PLLA between the polymer ester chain and dipyridamole
core rings.16,17 Interestingly, the long alkyl
chain ester of PCL does not exhibit such interaction, due to the limited
accessibility of the carbonyl groups surrounded by the Dip molecule.
When Dip is integrated within the branched polymers, its emission
behavior will heavily depend on the microenvironment parameters, such
as acceptor concentration and molecular packing in the polymeric matrix.
The absorption and emission spectra of dipyridamole, Dip–PLLA,
and Dip–PCL are given in Figure 3. The λabs values of Dip, Dip–PLLA,
and Dip–PCL are 413, 402, and 403 nm, respectively. Dip and
Dip–PCL show vibronic results of monoexponential decay with
10.73 ns in dimethylformamide (DMF). In the case of Dip–PLLA
in DMF, results from moderate change with triexponential decay. These
results indicate that the introduction of DMF in Dip–PCL alters
triexponential decay into monoexponential decay. This microenvironment
leads to an increase in the fluorescence intensity.

PCL, PLLA, Dip–PLLA, and Dip–PCL

normalized emission spectra of Dip, Dip–PLLA,
and Dip–PCL in CHCl3 (inset: photographs of Dip,
Dip–PLLA, and Dip–PCL in CHCl3 under 365
nm UV excitation).

Irrespective of structural
difference, both the polymers exhibit
relatively high nonradiative decay rates (Table 1), due to the nonradiative vibrational pathways
associated with the CH2 as well as COO bonds. Compared
to Dip, the Dip–PCL absorbance exhibits a 25 nm blue-shifted
emission maximum and both the compounds show a similarity in the vibrational
progression of the emission profile. The well-resolved emission peaks
confirm the lack of any charge-transfer transition in the excited
state in both the compounds. Strikingly, Dip–PLLA exhibits
a bathochromic shift of broad peak at 503 nm compared to Dip and Dip–PCL,
which indicates the existence of ICT in the emission process.30−32 It is also noted that difference in the solvent polarity has no
significant influence on the peak positioning of all three compounds
(Figure S3), while the emission intensity
enhanced with the concentration of CHCl3 solutions (Figures S4 and S5). Thus, it can be proposed
that the availability of a large number of carbonyl groups in the
proximity of Dip core in Dip–PLLA will lead to the formation
of the weak interaction between the electrons donating the amino part
of the heteroaromatic ring to the carbonyl acceptor moieties. Due
to the donor–acceptor interactions, the absorption and emission
spectra for Dip–PLLA appeared broad compared to the Dip and
Dip–PCL. In Dip–PCL, the limited availability of the
ester group (the presence of neighboring ester group only after five
CH2 groups on PCL chains) prevents donor–acceptor
interactions. This structural construction offers the Dip chromophore
in Dip–PCL to emit in the vibronic state even at low to high
concentrations. The weak bonding in Dip–PLLA has led to a larger
Stokes shift of 4994 cm–1 compared to Dip–PCL
(3761 cm–1), and this observation further supports
the above speculations.33−35Figure S5 shows the absorption and emission spectra of Dip by adjusting the
polarity with the different composition of CHCl3 and DMF.
It is interesting to note that increasing the concentration of DMF
has structured the emission profile with well-resolved vibronic peaks.
The same observation is also noted for Dip–PCL (Figure 4b). While in the case of Dip–PLLA,
increasing DMF concentration blue-shifted the emission maximum from
502 to 491 nm, parallelly, emission peaks are also getting a resolved
structure along with the quenching of luminescence (Figure 4a). This behavior is quite
interesting from Dip–PCL, and the steric situation of the Dip–PLLA
allows the C=O···N=C bonding interactions.
This complex C=O···N=C interaction of
Dip–PLLA was significantly affected by the aprotic solvent.
The environmental effect of the chromophore is complex, and the solvent
polarity cannot relate to a single theory.24,36 From the results, we speculate that the ICT state is stabilized
by the C=O···N=C interaction between
the emissive Dip core and C=O group of the polymeric chain,
and when DMF is added, the C=O group of the DMF replaces the
C=O···N=C interaction between the polymer
chain and Dip molecules, as can be seen from the schematic representation
in Figure 5.37 As a result of this, the molecular rigidity
decreases, which leads to more nonradiative decay pathways. On the
other hand, the aromatic pyrimido pyrimidine centers attract to each
other and may form H-aggregation, which will result in the blue shift
of the emission profile. In the case of Dip–PCL, the increasing
concentration of DMF enhances the emission intensity, and emission
profiles were observed as vibrationally well resolved.

2.2 Hollow
Microsphere: In Vitro Fluorescence
Sensing
Hollow microspheres were fabricated with single polymer
Dip–PLLA or Dip–PCL by the double-emulsion method. The
microspheres diameter is around 1–2 μm, as observed from
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 6. These microspheres were filtered
three times using a syringe filter to eliminate large particles. The
branched star-shaped architecture color change was observed by confocal
microscopy not making much difference in building block to assemble
comparative to Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL in Figure S7. This Dip-based polyester has good biocompatibility
with potential anticoagulation and angiogenesis in the living host,
which was evident from our earlier investigations.38 In this study, H9c2 cell lines were incubated with the
microspheres in an aqueous medium. The intracellular uptakes of Dip–PLLA
and Dip–PCL microsphere could be visualized after 1 h by live
cell imaging, based on the intrinsic fluorescence property of microsphere.
The blue fluorescence could visualize the Dip–PCL uptake in
the cells, and it spread throughout the cell cytoplasm. Dip–PLLA
microsphere uptake could be observed as a localized green fluorescence
in the certain region of the cells. The fluorescence intensity of
Dip–PLLA increased with increase in the concentration of microsphere,
as shown in Figure S8. These Dip-based
polymer microspheres are prepared from the single molecule, so dye
leakage will not occur like multiple additives spheres.4,5 On the other hand, the hydrophilicity of the drug carrier plays
an important role to permeate through the cell membrane via endocytosis
process. This cell permeation of a drug carrier with the size of 1–2
μm can be obtained by coating the particle surface with hydrophilic
vitamin E or PEG-1000.39−42 But in the case of Dip–PLLA- and Dip–PCL-based spheres
without any post-treatment, it can be easily permeated via cell wall,
which is due to more hydroxyl terminal groups in the branching system,
which enhanced the hydrophilicity of the polymer, leading to cell
adherence with more biological activity.38 The glass transition of the polymer does not have direct influence
on the bioactivities. Integrating, the synergetic effect of the additives
in a single molecule as a multifunctionalized material will simplify
the fabrication of drug carrier and reduce the cost.6,8,43,44

3 Conclusions
The influence of the polyester
chains on the emission of Dip molecule
was studied using Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL. The interaction
of C=O···N=C bonding in between PLLA
chains and Dip has been identified in Dip–PLLA by FTIR spectroscopy.
This ground-state C=O···N=C bonding leads
to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the excited state in Dip–PLLA.
In Dip–PCL, the availability of the −COO group is limited
compared to Dip–PLLA, which resists the C=O···N=C
interaction with Dip, and it exhibits vibronic progression in the
emission profile. The addition of DMF damages the interaction between
the Dip emissive core and C=O groups of the polymer chain in
PLLA. It leads to the change of color from green fluorescence to blue
fluorescence in Dip–PLLA. It identified that the interaction
of C=O···N=C is the key factor for color
change in Dip–PLLA. Fluorescence-sensible hollow microspheres
of Dip–PLLA and Dip–PCL were fabricated by the double-emulsion
method with microencapsulation technique, and the cell uptake of Dip-based
spheres was visualized via fluorescence images under in vitro conditions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Dipyridamole-based
PLLA
and dipyridamole-based PCL were synthesized as described in our previous
report.381H NMR spectrum of
Dip–PCL is shown in Figure S9. Poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) (Mw = 89–98 kDa)
and dipyridamole were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. High-performance
liquid chromatography-grade dichloromethane (DCM), DMF, toluene, and
chloroform were purchased from Mark Chemicals.

4.2 Microsphere
Preparation
Polymer (100
mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of DCM. The primary emulsion of 2% of PVA
was dissolved in hot water (70 °C) and cooled down to room temperature.
PVA solution (10 mL) was mixed with the polymer solution, and the
mixture was sonicated for 10 min in the ice bath. PVA solution (15
mL) was added and sonicated for 20 min; then, the mixture was stirred
to evaporate the DCM in the solution and then centrifuged at 10 000
rpm and filtered with 0.5 μm fillers.

4.3 Cell
Line Maintenance
H9c2 cell lines
(rat embryonic cardiomyoblasts) obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). For the maintenance of cell lines, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco), antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100
μg/mL streptomycin), and amphotericin (0.25 μg/mL) (HiMedia)
was employed. The cells were maintained in cell culture flasks in
CO2 incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in
air and 99% humidity. Passaging of cells when confluent was carried
out using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(HiMedia) in phosphate-buffered saline.

4.4 Cellular
Uptake Studies of Branched Polymers
by Fluorescence Imaging
Cellular uptake studies of branched
polymers were carried out by fluorescence imaging of adherent cells.
The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well
of 96-well black plates (BD Biosciences) for the purpose. After 36
h from seeding, the cells were first washed twice with Hanks’
balanced salt solution (HBSS) to remove DMEM. Then, the cells were
incubated with different concentrations of branched polymers in HBSS
for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed thrice with HBSS and
subjected to live cell imaging. Images were collected by the high-content
spinning disk facility (BD Pathway 855; BD Biosciences) using AttoVision
1.5.3 software. For imaging cellular uptake of SSPLLA, 488/10 nm excitation
filter and 515 nm long pass (LP) emission filter were used. For System
Support Package Components List (SSPCL), 360/10 nm excitation filter
and 420 nm LP emission filter were used. Imaging was done using a
high-content spinning disk facility from BD Biosciences. It is a fluorescence
microscope (BD Pathway 855) connected to an image analysis package
(AttoVision 1.5.3 software).

4.5 Measurement of Cell Fluorescence Intensities
of Branched Polymers
Fluorescence intensity measurements
were also carried out in adherent cells. The procedure adopted was
the same as that of the imaging protocol. For the analyses, a multimode
reader (BioTek) was used. The cells were seeded at a density of 5
× 103 cells/well of 96-well black plates (BD Biosciences)
for this purpose. After 36 h from seeding, the cells were first washed
twice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS). Then, the
cells were incubated with different concentrations of branched polymers
in HBSS for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed thrice with HBSS
and subjected to a fluorimeter using a fluorescence microplate reader
(Model: Synergy-4 Multimode reader, BioTek).

4.6 Instruments
Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra were measured in a Bruker tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer
with a resolution of 2 cm–1. The samples of Dip,
Dip–PCL, and Dip–PLLA in CH3Cl solution were
drop-cast on KBr pellet, and the films were dried in a vacuum oven.
The UV spectra of dipyridamole, Dip–PLLA, and Dip–PCL
were measured in solution state using Shimadzu model UV-3101PC-UV-NIR
spectrophotometers. The emission spectra quantum yields were recorded
in a SPEX-Fluorolog-3 FL3-221 spectrofluorimeter. The relative quantum
yield and absolute quantum yield were obtained by a standard procedure
and are given in the Supporting Information. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a
Zeiss EVO 18 cryo SEM Special Edn with a variable pressure detector
working at 20–30 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was performed in an FEI TECNAI 30 G2 S-TWIN microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 100 kV. The lifetimes of Dip, Dip–PLLA, and Dip–PCL
were measured on an Edinburgh FLS-980 Spectrometer with an EPL-375
optical laser.
