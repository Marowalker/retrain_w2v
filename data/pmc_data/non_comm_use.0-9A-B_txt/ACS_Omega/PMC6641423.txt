Bio-renewable lignin has been used
as a carbon source for the preparation
of porous carbon materials. Nevertheless, up to now, there are few
studies about the influence of molecular weight of lignin on the structure
and morphology of the ordered mesoporous carbon. Here, we synthesized
the ordered mesoporous carbon derived from different molecular weights
of lignin and Pluronic F127. Fortunately, we found that molecular
weight is an important factor for obtaining highly ordered channels,
high specific surface area, and ordered mesoporous carbon. More importantly,
the narrow well-defined mesoporous channel could exert a spatial restriction
effect to some extent, which can serve as nanoreactors for efficient
reactions and enhance catalytic performance. The highly ordered mesoporous
carbon from lignin is a good candidate for Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis catalyst supports.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
carbon materials have received significant
interest because of their unique geometrical structure and chemical
properties. These materials have been used in a broad range of applications,
such as electrode materials,1 fuel cells,2 adsorbents,3 supercapacitors,4,5 and catalyst supports.6 Among these carbon
materials, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have been
studied widely as catalyst supports. Besides these carbon materials,
the ordered mesoporous carbon has received increasing attention because
of their chemical inertness, good thermal stability, excellent catalytic
activity, high surface area, and easily tunable pore sizes.7 Currently, the ordered mesoporous carbon was
successively fabricated by a hard-template method8 or a soft-template method.9 Although
great progress has been made in the preparation of the ordered mesoporous
carbon, there are some details that remain to be investigated. First,
the carbon sources are related to toxic substances, such as phenol,
3-aminophenol, phloroglucinol, and hexaphenol,10−13 which are unsustainable substances.
Furthermore, there are few studies on the influence of molecular weight
of the carbon source on the pore structure and specific surface area.
Therefore, seeking sustainable carbon sources and the study of the
molecular weight of carbon sources are significant to the physical
and chemical properties of the ordered mesoporous carbon.

Lignin
is a low-cost, nontoxic, and carbon-rich sustainable resource,
which is the second most abundant amorphous polymer in nature.14,15 It can be obtained from a variety of sources, such as woody plants,
byproducts in paper factories, and even from industrial waste of biomass
ethanol.16,17 Lignin is a highly branched aromatic polymer
consisting of the phenylpropane coniferyl, p-coumaryl,
and sinapyl alcohol as monomer units with a large amount of functionalities,
such as methoxy, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups.17−19 Considering
the structural similarity of lignin with phenol (−OH), lignin
can be a promising natural alternative for phenolic resins in the
synthesis of the ordered mesoporous carbon. More importantly, lignin
is a nontoxic, low-cost, bio-renewable, and sustainable carbon source.

Actually, there have been tremendous efforts to obtain carbon materials
from lignin because of the abovementioned advantages. There are numerous
reports on the preparation of the porous carbon from lignin.20 In general, most studies focus on the effect
of templating agents on the pore structure or activating agents on
the specific surface area. Commonly, zeolites and Pluronic F1278 are used as the templating agents, KOH21 and CO2 are used as the activating
agents. Under these circumstances, the pore structure and surface
area were strongly dependent on the type of the template and activating
agent. However, lignin has no structural regularity in the polymeric
framework, with a wide molecular weight distribution, generally ranging
from several thousand to hundreds of thousands. Therefore, the preparation
of the ordered mesoporous carbon with lignin as the carbon source
is critical for its molecular weight. Owing to this reason, we are
motivated to discuss the formation of the ordered mesoporous carbon
from lignin with different molecular weights.

Herein, we report
for the first time the synthesis of the ordered
mesoporous carbon by the soft-template method using lignin as the
carbon source with different molecular weights. The focus of the work
is to investigate the effects of the lignin molecular weight on the
morphology and structure of the ordered mesoporous carbon. Then, we
study the catalytic performance of the ordered mesoporous carbon as
the catalyst support of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). In
addition, from a practical point of view, the ordered mesoporous carbon
for FTS applications is desirable for industrial mass production because
of the sustainable carbon sources of lignin.

Results and Discussion
The textural parameters of ESL-5, SL-5, and SL-2 obtained from
different extraction methods of lignin are listed in Table 1. The average molecular weight
(Mw) was determined by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC). The Mw values of
ESL-5, SL-5, and SL-2 were 2996, 1476, and 1055 g·mol–1, respectively. From the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm results, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
areas of the lignin precursors (ESL-5, SL-5, and SL-2) were 12.3,
9.8, 11.7 m2·g–1, respectively.

a Determined by N2 physisorption.

b The molecular weight was determined
by GPC.

The low-angle X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of CSL-2, CSL-5,
and CESL-5 are shown in Figure 1a. All of the sample exhibits an intense diffraction peak
at around 0.98 and a weak peak at around 1.4, which can be indexed
as (100) and (110) reflections associated with hexagonal pore regularity
of a p6mm space group.12,25 Meanwhile, with the increase of molecular weight, the diffraction
peak intensities of (100) and (110) crystal planes decrease significantly,
the 100 diffraction peak becomes less visible in CSL-5 and CESL-5,
and the 110 diffraction peak even disappears in CESL-5. However, all
of the diffraction peaks of CSL-2 are obviously visible, which suggests
that the molecular weight of the precursor is a key factor for the
formation of the ordered mesoporous carbon.

Figure 1 (a) Low-angle XRD patterns
and (b) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the ordered mesoporous carbon with different molecular
weights of lignin.

The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the
ordered mesoporous carbon synthesized using different molecular weights
are shown in Figure 1b. The CSL-2, CSL-5, and CESL-5 exhibit a type IV isotherm with a
H1-type hysteresis loop and large uptake at a low relative
pressure, indicating mesoporous and microporous characteristics.26 Moreover, the hysteresis loop of the H1-type hysteresis loop in the relative pressure at P/P0 = 0.45–0.75 reflects a high
uniformity of mesoporous structures.27 The
mesoporous structure is derived from the removal of the surfactant
F127. In addition, a high increase of nitrogen uptake at a low relative
pressure (P/P0 = 0.01–0.1)
corresponds to the volume adsorbed by micropores, which may originate
from the lignin framework during the pyrolysis process of C, H, and
O combustion.9,28 The pore size distributions were
calculated from the branches of the adsorption isotherms using the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model, and all the samples
show similar shapes with uniform mesopores, and most pore diameters
of obtained samples are all centered at about 3.8 nm (Figure 1 inset). In addition, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 1b) exhibit a strong uptake
at a low pressure of approximately 0.01–0.04, suggesting microporous
characteristics. As can be seen from Table 1, the surface area and the pore volume of
the ordered mesoporous carbon obtained from low-molecular-weight lignin
are higher than those of high-molecular-weight lignin. The specific
surface area and the pore volume have reached to 466.1 m2·g–1 and 0.62 cm3·g–1, respectively, which reveals that CSL-2 reaches well-order at long-range
distances. With further increase in the molecular weight from 1476
to 2966 g·mol–1, the surface area and pore
volumes of CSL-5 and CESL-5 decrease from 435.0 m2·g–1 and 0.58 cm3·g–1 to 236.4 m2·g–1 and 0.47 cm3·g–1, respectively, demonstrating that
with the increase of molecular weights, the order of the mesoporous
structure was disrupted. CSL-2 and CSL-5 show a higher surface area
and pore volume than CESL-5, which indicates that the molecular weight
of the precursor is a critical parameter to obtain the ordered mesoporous
carbon.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to inspect
the
morphology and microstructure of CSL-2, CSL-5, and CESL-5. As shown
in Figure 2, all the
samples display a mesoporous structure. The CSL-2 with the molecular
weight of 1055 g·mol–1 (Figure 2a,b) exhibits hexagonally arranged and stripe-like
patterns in large domains, authenticating an ordered 2D hexagonal
mesoporous characteristics. When the molecular weight increases to
1476 g·mol–1, CSL-5 shows results similar to
CSL-2 from the TEM observation (Figure 2c,d), further confirming the successful formation of
an ordered mesostructure. However, when the molecular weight reaches
2996 g·mol–1, the mesoporous ordering of CESL-5
(Figure 2e,f) is much
weaker than that of CSL-2, which agrees with the results of low-angle
XRD. On the basis of the abovementioned analysis, the lignin with
a small molecular weight is beneficial to the formation of the long-range
ordered mesoporous carbon, and the channel is straight. With the increase
of the molecular weight, the pore ordering becomes worse, short range,
and even chaotic. This phenomenon could be explained by the facts
that (i) low-molecular-weight lignin has more hydroxyl groups in unit
mass, conducive formation of micelles with the block copolymer surfactants
(F127), which is easy to form the ordered mesoporous structure28 and (ii) low-molecular-weight lignin perhaps
has higher chain mobility, making lignin segments easier to carbonize,
resulting in a more ordered mesoporous structure. On the basis of
the abovementioned analysis, it can be conjectured that large-molecular-weight
precursors are unfavorable to the formation of the ordered mesoporous
carbon.29 Therefore, to obtain carbon materials
with a highly ordered pore structure and a large specific surface
area, a relatively low-molecular-weight precursor should be considered.

weights of lignin: (a,b) CSL-2; (c,d) CSL-5; and (e,f) CESL-5.

XRD was performed to identify
the crystal phase of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5,
and Fe/CESL-5. It can be seen from Figure 3a that the five broad peaks at around 30.2°,
35.6°, 43.3°, 57.2°, and 62.9° are indexed to
the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) reflection for magnetite,
respectively (Fe3O4, JCPDS card no. 39-1346).
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further employed
to analyze the surface composition of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5.
The data of XPS spectrum analysis are presented in Figures 3b and S1 (Supporting Information). Three main peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and
Fe 2p were present in all spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information) because Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5
contain only C, O, and Fe elements.30 The
Fe 2p binding energy spectra of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5
are shown in Figure 3b. The peaks at around 710.9 and 724.2 eV are assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks, respectively. The 718.8
eV binding energy was attributed to the satellite peak of Fe 2p3/2. The satellite peak and the 13.3 eV difference between
Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks indicate the characteristics
of the Fe3+ state,31 which is
in accord with the results of XRD pattern results.

(b) Fe 2p spectra of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and

TEM images of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5,
and Fe/CESL-5 nanocomposites
show stripe-like patterns in large domains, confirming ordered mesoporous
characteristics (Figure 4). The dark spots are observed for iron nanoparticles, which are
dispersed homogeneously in the matrix of the ordered mesoporous carbon.
From the TEM images of Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 (Figure 4a–d), we can see that the Fe2O3 particles were dispersed homogeneously in the carbon
matrix without aggregation, and most of the Fe2O3 nanoparticle distribution curve demonstrates a mean diameter of
about 9–10 nm (Figure 4a,c, inset). However, slight agglomeration began to occur
in Fe/CESL-5 (Figure 4e,f), and the size of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in
Fe/CESL-5 is approximately 12 nm (Figure 4e, inset).

(c,d), and Fe/CESL-5 (e,f).

Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5 were studied as catalysts
in
FTS reaction. Table 2 and Figure 5 summarize
the hydrocarbon product distribution, lower olefin selectivity, and
other performance of all the catalysts. CO conversion is a rough measure
of the FTS reaction of catalysts. As can be seen in Table 2, Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 catalysts
exhibit higher CO conversion than Fe/CESL-5 (86.1, 82.3, and 69.4%,
respectively). First, according to the results of XRD, Fe/CSL-2 and
Fe/CSL-5 exhibit regular ordered mesoporous channels, which are favorable
for mass transfer and diffusion. This may be one reason for the higher
CO conversion. Second, according to the results of N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 display a higher surface area, which
can provide more adsorption sites and promote the conversion of CO.
Furthermore, Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 show Fe2O3 nanoparticles smaller than Fe/CESL-5, which can help to increase
CO conversion.9

c O/P is the ratio of olefin to paraffin
in all of the C2–4 hydrocarbons.

The product distributions of all
catalysts are shown in Table 2 and Figure 5a. CH4 selectivity
for Fe/CESL-5 (28.9%) is more than that for Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5
(25.3 and 24.6%). However, the C2–C4 olefin
selectivity increases from 35.4% (Fe/CESL-5) to 41.3 and 43.1% (for
Fe/CSL-5 and Fe/CSL-2, respectively). C=/Cn is an important index of FTS to lower olefins (FTO).
It can be also seen in Table 2 that Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 with smaller Fe2O3 nanoparticles and regular ordered mesoporous channels (3.78
and 3.04) exhibit higher O/P than Fe/CESL-5 (2.16). On the basis of
the abovementioned analysis, Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 exhibit excellent
FTO performance because of the unique regular ordered mesoporous channels,
highly dispersed active phases, smaller Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and weaker interactions with supports.32 To further study the catalytic performance, Figure 5b shows the CO conversion
of Fe/CSL-2, Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5 as a function of time on stream.
The CO conversions of Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 catalysts were 86.6 and
82.5% initially and then decreased to 80.1 and 75.9% after 68 h on
stream; no significant decrease was observed in the following reaction
time. However, the CO conversion of Fe/CESL-5 dropped much faster
(from 69.4 to 59.5%) after 68 h on stream. Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5 show
excellent catalytic performance, which may be attributed to smaller
Fe2O3 nanoparticles that were embedded in the
ordered mesoporous carbon matrix, effectively avoiding agglomeration
and sintering during the FTO reaction.33

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized the
ordered mesoporous
carbon from renewable lignin precursors using the surfactant Pluronic
F127 as the pore-forming agent. According to the results of low-angle
XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and TEM,
CSL-2 and CSL-5 show higher surface area and well-defined mesoporous
channels than CESL-5, which suggested that the molecular weight of
lignin plays an important role in the preparation of the ordered mesoporous
carbon. Furthermore, because of their unique pore structure, smaller
iron nanoparticles, and spatial confinement effect, Fe/CSL-2 and Fe/CSL-5
exhibit higher O/P (3.78 and 3.04) in the FTO reaction. Utilizing
lignin-based porous materials with a controlled pore channel structure
in energy-related applications will promote the development of paper
mills and biomass ethanol refineries and enhance sustainability.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Lignin with Different Molecular Weights
Soft wood lignin was purchased from Nanjing Forestry University.
The lignin contained a large number of G and S units; the number of
G units in lignin is more than S units. The lignin was used as received
without further purification. First, lignin was dissolved in water
solution under stirring at room temperature which is added to 1 wt
% NaOH to adjust the pH = 9–10 and then into 5% HNO3 to adjust the pH = 2 and pH = 5. It was followed by centrifugation
at 4200 rpm for 5 min and washing with water until pH = 7. Finally,
it is dried at 120 °C for 3 h. The obtained lignin was labeled
as SL-2 and SL-5. The straw lignin was extracted from straw feedstock,
and ethanol was used as solvent. First, the straw was packed with
weighing paper, then placed in a Soxhlet extractor, added to ethanol,
installed in a condenser tube, and returned at 100 °C for 6 h,
and finally, straw lignin was obtained; it was then added into 5%
HNO3 to adjust the pH = 5. It was followed by centrifugation
at 4200 rpm for 5 min and washing with water until pH = 7. Finally,
it was dried at 120 °C for 3 h. The obtained lignin was labeled
as ESL-5.

Synthesis of Lignin-Based Oligomer Precursors
The precursors
were prepared by using lignin and formaldehyde according to our own
method.16,22 Typically, 1.0 g of lignin was added into
12.0 g of 3 wt % NaOH water solution under stirring at 40 °C,
and 1.6 g of formalin solution (37 wt % formalin) was subsequently
added; then, the temperature was raised to 70 °C, and reaction
took place for 1.5 h; after that, it was added into 1% HNO3 to adjust the pH = 5. Finally, the lignin-based oligomer precursors
were dissolved in 20 wt % water solution.

Preparation of the Ordered
Mesoporous Carbon
The ordered
mesoporous carbons were synthesized by the soft-template method. For
a typical preparation, 3 g of Pluronic F127 was added into 40 g of
precursors. After stirring for 2 h, the brown mixture was dried at
50 °C for 24 h, then the temperature raised to 120 °C for
24 h. Finally, the composites were carbonized at 600 °C for 3
h with a ramping rate of 1 °C/min under an argon flow. The obtained
samples were denoted as CSL-2, CSL-5, and CESL-5.

Synthesis of
Iron Nanoparticle-Incorporated Mesoporous Carbon
Composites
The iron nanoparticle-incorporated mesoporous
carbon composites were prepared by the impregnating method. For a
typical preparation, 1.0 g of ordered mesoporous carbons was dispersed
in 60 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication for 2 h to obtain a
black suspension, and then 1.0 g of iron nitrate nonahydrate dissolved
in 25 mL of ethanol was added to the black suspension with stirring.
After the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 8 h, the
mixture was heated to 120 °C for 24 h. Finally, the composites
were carbonized at 350 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 1 °C/min
under the argon flow. The obtained samples were denoted as Fe/CSL-2,
Fe/CSL-5, and Fe/CESL-5.

Measurements and Characterizations
Conventional powder
XRD patterns were acquired on a Rigaku D/Max2rB-II X-ray diffractometer
(XRD, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at
40 kV and 100 mA (scanning step 8°/s). The low-angle XRD patterns
were collected on a D/max-2500 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation,
40 kV and 150 mA). GPC analyses were carried out using a UV detector
on a 4-column sequence of Waters Styragel columns (HR0.5, HR2, HR4
and HR6) at a 1.00 mL/min flow rate.23,24 TEM images
were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operated at 200
kV. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C
on an automated volumetric apparatus NOVA 2000e (Quantachrome Instruments,
USA). The multipoint BET method was utilized to calculate the specific
surface areas and the pore volume. Pore size distribution was determined
from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the BJH model. The
X-ray photoelectron spectrum date was obtained with a PerkinElmer
PHI5000C XPS meter with Al Kα radiation (hν
= 1486.6 eV) as the excitation source.

FTS products were conducted
online with two gas chromatographs. The GC9860 gas chromatograph equipped
with 2 m long TDX-01 connected to the thermal conductivity detector
was used to analyze H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2, whereas hydrocarbons (C1–C30) were analyzed by a GC9860 gas chromatograph equipped with
a PONA capillary column (50 m × 0.25 mm × 0.50 μm)
connected to a flame ionization detector.
