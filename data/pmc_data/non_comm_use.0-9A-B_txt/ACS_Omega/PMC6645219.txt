The dichloro titanium complexes (OSSOtBu)TiCl2 (1) and
(OSSOCum)TiCl2 (2) bearing o-phenylene-bridged
OSSO-type ligands [OSSOtBu-H = 6,6′-((1,2-phenylenebis(sulfanediyl))bis(methylene))bis(2,4-di-tert-butyphenol) and OSSOCum-H = 6,6′-((1,2-phenylenebis(sulfanediyl))bis(methylene))bis(2,4-bis(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)phenol)]
were prepared and characterized. The X-ray structure of 1 revealed that Ti atom has an octahedral coordination geometry with
an fac–fac wrapping of the
[OSSO] ligand. In solution at 25 °C, 1 mainly retains
the C2 symmetric structure, whereas 2 shows an equilibrium between C2- and C1-symmetric stereoisomers. Activation
of 2 with (Ph3C)[B(C6F5)4] led to a highly active catalytic system with an activity
of 238 kgPE·molcat–1·bar–1·h–1; linear polyethylene with
a Tm of 122 °C and Mw of 107 kDa were obtained under these conditions. Catalyst 1 displayed the moderate activity of 59 kgPE·molcat–1·bar–1·h–1. Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed
the formation of high-molecular-weight polyethylenes with very large
distributions of the molecular weights, indicating a low control of
the polymerization process, probably becaue of the presence of different
active species in solution. Density functional theory investigation
provides a rational for the relative high-molecular-weight polymers
obtained with these complexes. The precatalyst 2 was
also active in propylene polymerization producing atactic oligomers
terminated with unsaturated end groups.

Introduction
The last decades have
witnessed the development of new nonmetallocene
early-transition metal complexes as catalyst precursors for olefin
polymerization.1 Among these, group 4 complexes
of polydentate ligands, based on a bis(phenolate) framework with additional
donors, are particularly acknowledged.2 Indeed, Fujita3 and Coates4 reported on bis(phenoxy-imine) group 4 complexes
that are very active in the ethylene polymerization and produce syndiotactic
polypropylene under living conditions. Later on, Kol et al. developed
a zirconium complex coordinated by a diamine bis(phenolate) [ONNO]-type
ligand that is able to promote the living polymerization of 1-hexene
with high isospecificity.5 Since then,
several group 4 metal complexes featuring [ONNO]-,6 [OSSO]-,7 [OOOO]-,8 and [OPPO]-type9 tetradentate
ligands have been reported in literature. Among these examples, the
family of group 4 complexes bearing the bis(phenolate) ligands with
soft-donor sulfur atoms has shown some peculiar features. As a matter
of fact, the titanium complexes with 1,4-dithiabutanediyl-linked [OSSO]-type
ligands are highly active precatalysts not only for the isospecific
polymerization of styrene10 but also have
shown a unique behavior in the homo- and copolymerization of diene
monomers.11 Kol et al., following these
results, introduced a methylene group between the S donor and the
arene ring, obtaining an improvement of the activity in 1-hexene polymerization
with respect to the analogous salan-type complex but with a concomitant
loss of stereocontrol.12 More recently,
high isoselectivity in 1-hexene polymerization was achieved by Ishii
et al. using a zirconium complex with an [OSSO]-type ligand featuring
both methylene and trans-1,2-cyclooctanediyl spacers
in the molecular backbone.13 These results
clearly show that the activity is profoundly affected by the dimension
of the ring. Notably, it resulted that both an increase or a decrease
of the number of carbon atom with respect to the cyclooctanediyl ring
leads to a decrement of the catalytic activity.13e

To further explore these structure–activity
relationships
in the OSSO ligands with methylene spacers, we turned our attention
to OSSO ligands with the phenylene bridge. Moreover, we focused on
titanium complexes because this metal is a cost-effective alternative
to the other heavier group IV elements. Herein, we report on the synthesis
and characterization of new titanium complexes, supported by o-phenylene-bridged bis(phenolato) ligands and on their
activity as catalyst precursors in ethylene and propylene polymerization.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Crystal Structure
The preligands OSSOtBu-H and OSSOCum-H [OSSOtBu-H = 6,6′-((1,2-phenylenebis(sulfanediyl))bis(methylene))-bis(2,4-di-tert-butyphenol) and OSSOCum-H = 6,6′-((1,2-phenylenebis(sulfanediyl))bis(methylene))-bis(2,4-bis(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)phenol)]
were synthesized following the published procedure, that is, by reaction
between the appropriate 2-(bromomethyl)-phenol and benzene-1,2-dithiol.14 These compounds were recently employed by us
for the synthesis of a series of alcoholate group IV complexes that
mediated the immortal ROP of l-lactide affording polymers
with controlled molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indexes.14

Complexes 1–2 (1 = OSSOtBuTiCl2, 2 = OSSOCumTiCl2) were prepared by the
direct reactions of the preligand OSSOtBu-H or OSSOCum-H with an equimolar amount of TiCl4 in toluene solution at room temperature, as reported in Scheme 1. Removal of the
volatile materials under reduced pressure gave red solids, which were
recrystallized by acetonitrile affording analytically pure 1–2 in high yield (82 and 89%, respectively). Single crystals suitable
for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained for complex 1. The crystal structure of 1 (Figure 1) revealed that the complex possesses an
idealized C2 symmetry with the Ti atom
adopting a slightly distorted octahedral coordination.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Phenylene-Bridged OSSOR-H Ligands and of the Corresponding
Titanium Complexes 1 and 2
The [OSSO]-type ligand has the usual fac–fac wrapping coordination mode,
in which the two oxygen
atoms are in trans position, the two sulfur atoms are in cis position,
and the two chlorides are also mutually cis. The rigidity of the OSSO
skeleton causes a distortion of the classical octahedral coordination,
forcing the deviation of the O–Ti–O angle from linearity
[O1–Ti–O2 161.09(14)°] as it has been found also
in the analogous [{L1}Ti(O–iPr)2] [O–Ti–O 159.76(8)°].15 The Ti–S distances [Ti–S1 2.601(2); Ti–S2
2.603(2) Å] are shorter than those found in a similar di-isopropoxy
Ti(IV) complex bearing an OSSO-type ligand [2.7022(11) and 2.6958(12)
Å] but longer than the Ti–S bond lengths [2.5618(9) and
2.5730(8) Å] observed in the dimeric Ti(III) complex bearing
two bridging chlorides in addition to the OSSO ligands.13c The S1–Ti–S2 bite angle of 77.88(5)°
falls in the normal range observed for this kind of angles. The two
chlorides are far from each other with an angle of 104.89(6)°.

Solution Structures
The coordination of a tetradentate
ligand to a metal center can produce three octahedral stereoisomers,
designated as mer–mer (trans), fac–fac (cis-α), and fac–mer (cis-β) belonging
to the C2v, C2, and C1 point groups, respectively.
Cause of the weak bond between the hard titanium center and the soft
sulfur atom, [OSSO]–Ti complexes have a stereochemically nonrigid
coordination geometry. When dissolved in solution, they may display
fluxional processes and/or equilibria between the different stereoisomers.
The number of species in solution, their geometry, and the exchange
processes of 1 and 2 were investigated with
the aid of NMR spectroscopy.

In the 1H NMR spectrum
of 1 (1,2-dideutero-1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, TCDE,
as the solvent), a unique set of the resonances was observed in which
the methylene protons of the coordinated ligand resonates as an AB
pattern at 4.35 and 3.61 ppm, as expected for diastereotopic protons
in a C2-symmetric environment (Figure
S4, Supporting Information). This indicates
that, in solution, complex 1 retains the same fac–fac ligand wrapping to the metal
center observed in the solid state. The heating of the solution up
to 50 °C produced only a line broadening of the signals. Differently,
when the solution of 1 was cooled at subambient temperature,
a second pattern of resonances was observed. The methylene protons
of this new isomer gave rise to four doublets at δ 4.93, 4.46,
4.32, and 4.00 ppm, suggesting a C1 symmetry
for the metal complex. The ratio between the C1 and C2 isomers is 1:4 at −40
°C. The exchange process was investigated by appropriate exchange
spectroscopy experiments (1H–1H EXSY)
at −40 °C (Figure S5, Supporting Information). EXSY peaks between the signals of the methylene groups in each
isomer were easily observed. In addition, a second series of less
intense cross-peaks correlating the signals of the methylene groups
of the two isomers were also detected. These peaks testify a rapid
Δ−Λ enantiomer exchange for both the C1 and C2 isomers
and a slower interconversions between the two geometric C1 and C2 isomers.

For
the more steric encumbered complex 2, two sets
of signals attesting the presence of the C1 and C2 isomers were observed at room
temperature (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It is worth noting that the ratio between the C1 and C2 isomers is 2:1 at
30 °C. The 1H–1H EXSY (at 30 °C)
proved that the Δ−Λ enantiomer exchange and the C1 and C2 interconversions
occur also in this case (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Portion of the 1H–1H EXSY
NMR spectrum
of 2 (τm = 0.300 s, TCDE, 30 °C,
and 600 MHz).

This behavior was previously
observed for other titanium complexes
bearing OSSO ligands containing methylene spacers, that is, ethylene-bridged
and cyclooctanediyl-bridged [OSSO]-type ligands. The C1 symmetric isomer was the prevailing isomer for the ethylene-bridged
complex (C1/C2 = 1:4),16 whereas the C2 symmetric isomer was prevailing for the cyclooctanediyl-bridged
complex (C1/C2 = 2:1).13e Variable-temperature NMR analysis
indicates a reversible conversion of two isomers at 60 °C for
the titanium dichloro complex with ethylene-bridged [OSSO]-type ligand.
For the titanium complex with cyclooctanediyl-bridged [OSSO]-type
ligand, the NMR spectrum of the mixtures of isomers was unchanged
up to 100 °C.

Polymerization Studies
Complexes 1–2 were tested in ethylene polymerization after activation
with modified
methylaluminoxane (MMAO) or AliBu3/[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in toluene at room temperature. The main results are summarized
in Table 1.

c Polymerization time = 1 h.

d kgPE molcat–1 bar–1 h–1.

e Determined by GPC with respect to
polystyrene standard.

Upon
activation with MMAO, both complexes led to active polymerization
catalysts. Complex 1 showed an activity of 10 kg mol–1 h–1, whereas using complex 2, the activity increases to 42 kg mol–1 h–1 (entries 1 and 2, Table 1). The activity of 2 decreases
when the [Al]/[Ti] molar ratio is changed from 1000 to 2000 or 500
(entries 3 and 4, Table 1). The obtained polyethylenes (PEs) were scarcely soluble
in common aliphatic solvents. For this reason, the polymer products
were extracted in boiling xylene and the soluble fractions were characterized
by NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. All PE samples were
linear and showed a melting point of 135 °C. The molecular weight
distributions were broad, with very high dispersity indexes (Đ), probably because of a partial activation of the
active species or to degradation of the catalyst when treated with
alkyl aluminum excess.

Treatment with Al-iBu3 (Al/Ti
molar ratio of 20), followed by reaction with 1 equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4], afforded ethylene
polymerization catalysts with activities higher than those obtained
with MMAO. Indeed, in the case of complex 1, an increment
of the activity to 59 kgPE molcat–1 bar–1 h–1 was recorded (entry
5, Table 1). Using
complex 2, with bulky cumyl substituents on the phenol
rings, the effect on the catalytic performance is more pronounced,
with a fivefold enhancement of the catalytic activity (compare entries
2 and 6, Table 1).
With the activity value of 238 kgPE·molcat–1·bar–1·h–1, complex 2 can be rated as a highly active catalyst,
according to the scale proposed by Gibson.1b The comparison between complexes 1 and 2 suggests that increasing the steric hindrance around the metal center
leads to a more effective catalytic active species. The DSC analysis
of the PEs suggested the formation of highly linear polymers with
a melting point of about 122 °C for 2 and of about
130 °C for 1. The NMR analysis confirmed the linear
nature of the obtained polymers. The 1H NMR spectrum of
PE by 2 shows a singlet because of the polymethylene
sequence at δ 1.16 ppm; a unique signal at δ 28 ppm in
the 13C NMR spectrum was parallely observed, and no end
group was detected (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The molecular weight distributions of PEs are bimodal and the Đ values are large, probably as a result of different
active species (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

Complex 2 was also investigated in propylene
polyinsertion.
It resulted moderately active at room temperature with an activity
value of 3 kgPP·molcat–1·bar–1·h–1 at 25 °C
(entry 7, Table 1)
but became inactive at low temperature. The crude products appeared
as low melting waxes. In the 1H NMR spectrum signals belonging
to unsaturated chain ends were clearly detected (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Two broad resonances
at 4.57 and 4.65 ppm and a resonance at 1.60 ppm indicate the presence
of vinylidene end group because of β-hydride transfer from the
last 1,2 inserted propylene unit. In addition, three complex multiplets
at 5.0, 5.4, and 5.8 ppm are due to allylic and cis-2-butenyl end groups.17 Allylic chain
end group arises from the β-methyl transfer to the metal center
from the last propylene unit inserted with a 1,2-regiochemistry or
from the β-hydride transfer from the methyl of the propylene
unit inserted with a 2,1-regiochemistry. cis-2-Butenyl
end group is due to the β-hydride transfer from the last inserted
propylene unit with 2,1 regiochemistry after 1,2 insertion. A minor
signal because of the 3-butenyl chain end group is also detected;
this group comes from the β-hydride transfer from the methyl
of the last inserted propylene unit with 2,1 regiochemistry after
1,2 insertion.

The signals diagnostic of these terminations
were also detected
in the 13C NMR spectrum of the oligomers obtained
by 2 (Figure 3). Vinylidene (44%) and allyl (39%) end groups are the principal
end groups, and cis-2-butenyl and 3-butenyl end groups
amount to 14 and 3%, respectively.

Figure 3 13C NMR spectrum of olefinic
region of polypropylene
oligomers sample from run 7 in Table 1 (CDCl3, 25 °C, and 75 MHz). Signals
marked with * are due to Ph3CH.

The 13C NMR analysis of oligopropylene showed
an atactic
microstructure, as revealed by the pattern of signals in the methyl
pentad region. The regioregularity of the monomer insertion was not
elevated. The signals in the ranges of 34.1–35.6 and 14.7–17.2
ppm because of the methylene carbons of the tail-to-tail sequence
and methyl carbons of the head-to-head concatenation were observed
with approximately the same area giving a total amount of regioirregular
sequences of 27%.

Molecular Modeling Studies
To shed
light on the polymerization
mechanism promoted by the title catalytic systems, a density functional
theory (DFT) study was carried out. We investigated chain propagation
and chain termination, the elementary steps involved in the reaction,
using as a model of the active species the cationic n-propyl complex deriving from the C2 isomer
of 1 (AC2). The energy profile is displayed
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Calculated
pathways for ethylene insertion and β-hydrogen
transfer to the monomer (BHT). Energies are given in kcal mol–1.

According to the coordination
insertion mechanism, the ethylene
coordination to the active species leads to the π-complex B, from which both chain propagation and chain termination
can start. The coordination energy of ethylene is quite low (−0.7
kcal/mol). The propagation reaction proceeds through the insertion
of ethylene into the metal–carbon bond. This step requires
overcoming a quite low barrier of 1.3 kcal/mol (Figure 4) and involves the four-membered transition
state TSCP (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Geometries of the transition-state TSCP and TSBHT.

The resulting insertion
product C is more stable than B by −18.1
kcal/mol. Alternately, the π-complex B can lead
to the termination of the growing polymer chain
through the β-hydrogen transfer to the monomer (BHT). The process
involves the migration of a hydrogen atom in the β position
belonging to the alkyl chain to the nearest carbon atom of the monomer.
The corresponding transition state TSBHT reminds a bis(olefin) complex, characterized by
a strong metal–hydrogen interaction. As a matter of fact, the
distance between the metal atom and the hydrogen atom moving from
the alkyl group to the monomer was found to be 1.91 Å (Figure 5). The barrier associated
with this step is 7.0 kcal/mol. A second termination process is the
β-hydrogen elimination (BHE). Lacking the coordinated monomer,
one of the hydrogen atom of the alkyl chain in β-position can
move to the metal center. It is generally reported that BHE is not
the preferential chain termination reaction in the ethylene polymerization
promoted by OSSO-type complex reactions because of its substantially
higher activation energy compared to the BHT process.18 For this reason, the barrier for this step was not calculated.
The balance between β-hydrogen transfer and chain propagation
has a direct consequence on the catalytic behavior: more competitive
the BHT process is, longer polymeric chains are. An estimation of
the competition between the two process is given by the different
heights of the corresponding activation barriers (ΔΔEBHT-CP#). The ΔΔEBHT-CP# for title catalytic
system is 5.7; this value indicates that our catalyst system is prone
in producing long polymeric chains in agreement with the experimental
results.

It should be noted that the prototypal titanium complex
dichloro{1,4-dithiabutanediyl-2,2′-bis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenoxy)}titanium (3), activated
with MAO, leads to high-molecular-weight-branched PE.19 Experimental evidence supported by DFT calculations suggested
that the mechanism involves the in situ formation of α-olefins
by β-hydride elimination followed by the reinsertion of these
α-olefins during the propagation step.18,19 The insertion and the BHT barriers computed for 3 at
the same level of theory were lower than those obtained for our model
complex: the insertion barrier was 1.0 kcal/mol, whereas the BHE barrier
was 5.9 kcal/mol and the corresponding ΔΔEBHT-CP# for 3 is 4.9 kcal/mol.18 Thus, different polymeric architecture obtained by these catalysts
can be addressed to the more competitive termination process found
for complex 3 with respect to the catalytic system reported
in this study.

The multimodal GPC traces of polymers obtained
with our catalytic
systems suggest the formation of multiple catalytically active species
having different polymerization performances. Even though the origin
of multimodality is still not completely clear and it is necessary
to use caution in deducing the real active species from the solution
structures of the precatalysts, we wonder if the coordination isomerism
of the precatalysts could cause the broadening of the molecular weight
distribution. Thus, we turn our attention to the other possible geometric
isomers of the active species, that is, the isomer with a mer–mer wrapping of the OSSO ligand
around the metal center (AC2v) and the isomer with an fac–mer wrapping of the OSSO ligand (AC1). AC2v would not lead to insertion because it could
only capture an olefin trans to the alkyl group; therefore, it was
not further considered. AC2v was successfully optimized and showed very similar energy respect
to AC2, but all our attempts to locate the corresponding ethylene
coordination adduct were unsuccessful. The potential energy curve
resulting from the nearing of ethylene to the titanium atom of AC2 presented a minimum when the ethylene was placed at about
5.0 Å from the titanium atom, a distance coherent with the formation
of a van der Waals adduct, not with a coordination adduct. Thus, AC2v and AC1 should only
represent inactive/dormant species that do not influence the distribution
of the molecular weights. In light of these observations, the formation
of multiple active species would derive from partial transformation
of the precatalyst structure by the aluminum cocatalyst.

Conclusions
The dichloro titanium complexes 1–2, supported
by [OSSO]-type ligands with an o-phenylene-bridge,
were prepared and completely characterized in solution by NMR spectroscopy.
For complex 1, the X-ray crystal structure revealed that
the titanium complex has a C2-symmetric
conformation with a distorted octahedral geometry about the titanium
center. In solution, 1 mainly maintained the C2 symmetric structure while 2 displayed
an equilibrium between C2- and C1-symmetric stereoisomers.

Upon activation
with MMAO, these complexes were found to be active
for ethylene polymerization. The use of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4], in the presence of AliBu3 as an alkylating agent and a scavenger,
produced much more active catalysts; in particular, complex 2 showed a high activity of 238 kgPE·molcat–1·bar–1·h–1. Linear high-molecular-weight PEs were obtained with
broad dispersity indexes, probably because of the presence of different
active species in solution.

DFT investigation on the elementary
steps of the polymerization
process revealed that the  β-hydrogen transfer to the monomer,
the principal termination process, is not competitive with respect
to propagation, explaining the production of long polymer chains.
The ΔΔEBHT-CP# values for our catalytic system are
higher than that computed for the prototypal titanium complex 3, in agreement with the different polymeric architecture
obtained by these catalysts. Moreover, we found that the multimodal
molecular weight distribution cannot be addressed to the coordination
isomerism of the precatalysts as only the active species deriving
from the C2 isomer is catalytically active,
whereas the other possible species are inactive/dormant species.

The precatalyst 2 was also active in propene polymerization
at room temperature, producing atactic oligomers terminated with unsaturated
end groups.

Procedure for
Ethylene Polymerization Using MMAO
Ethylene
polymerizations were carried out in a 250 mL Buchi glass reactor equipped
with a mechanical stirrer. In a typical procedure, the reactor vessel
was charged with a toluene solution of MMAO (0.1 M, 90 mL), pressurized
with ethylene and vented three times. After the mixture was thermostated
at the required temperature and 1 atm of ethylene, a toluene solution
of precatalyst (10 μmol in 10 mL) was injected into the reactor,
and the ethylene was rapidly charged to the prescribed pressure. After
the specific reaction time, ethylene was evacuated and the polymerization
mixture was poured in ethanol acidified with aqueous HCl. The solid
polymer was collected by filtration, washed with fresh ethanol, and
dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C.

Procedure for Ethylene
and Propylene Polymerization Using (Ph3C)[B(C6F5)4]
Ethylene
polymerizations were carried out in a 250 mL Buchi glass reactor equipped
with a mechanical stirrer. In a typical procedure, the reactor vessel
was charged with a toluene solution of AliBu3 (0.2 mmol in 90 mL), pressurized with the gaseous
monomer and vented three times. After the mixture was thermostated
at the required temperature and 1 atm of monomer, a toluene solution
(10 mL) of precatalyst (10 μmol) and (Ph3C)[B(C6F5)4] (5.6 mg, 10 μmol) was injected
into the reactor, and the monomer was rapidly charged to the prescribed
pressure. After the specific reaction time, the gaseous monomer was
evacuated and the polymerization mixture was poured in ethanol acidified
with aqueous HCl. The solid polymer was collected by filtration, washed
with fresh ethanol, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C.

In the case of propylene polymerization promoted by 2, oligomers were extracted from the oligomerization reaction with
CHCl3 and dried on MgSO4. The excess solvent
was distilled off at reduced pressures.

Computational Details
DFT calculations were performed
with the Gaussian 09 program suite.20 All
geometrical optimizations were performed at the BP86 level, that is,
employing the exchange–correlation functionals of Becke and
Perdew,21 respectively. The electronic
configuration was described with the quasi-relativistic LANL2DZ22 effective core potential for Ti and S, whereas
we adopted the SVP23 basis set for O, C,
and H. To save computational resources, the alkyl groups of the OSSO
ligand in ortho position were modeled with the tert-butyl groups, whereas the alkyl groups in para position were replaced
by hydrogen atoms. The structures of transition states were located
by applying Schlegel’s synchronous transit-guided quasi-Newton
(QST2) method as implemented in Gaussian 09. All geometries were characterized
as minimum or transition state through frequency calculations. The
differences in energy reported in Figure 4 are in the gas phase without zero-point
correction. Cartesian coordinates of all DFT optimized structures
are available on request. Structures were visualized by the CYLview
program.24
