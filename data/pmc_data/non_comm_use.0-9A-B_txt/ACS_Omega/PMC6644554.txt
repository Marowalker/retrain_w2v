The
700–950 cm–1 range in infrared spectroscopy
was investigated for various imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs).
Two main vibrational modes of the methylimidazolium cation exist in
this region. At 700–800 cm–1, there is an
out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H
bending mode with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H in
the imidazolium ring, whereas at 800–950 cm–1, there is an out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(2)–H in the imidazolium ring. The molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance spectrum of the former band at 700–800 cm–1, which is related to the bending mode with a large +C(4,5)–H
motion in the imidazolium ring, is not particularly sensitive to the
interactions with anions. The molar-concentration-normalized absorbance
spectrum of the latter band at 800–950 cm–1 was nearly identical for ILs that have methylimidazolium cations
with carbon chains of different lengths and the same anions. The band
shape of the latter band, which is related to the bending mode with
a large out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending motion, was
highly sensitive to the interactions with anions and, interestingly,
both blue- and red-shifted tendencies in the spectrum for each system
were observed.

Introduction
Room-temperature ionic
liquids (ILs), comprising entirely of ions
in a liquid state below 100 °C, have striking characteristics,
such as low melting points, extremely low volatility, enhanced chemical
and thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, lubrication ability,
and enhanced solubility for various materials.1−6 The unique and fascinating features of ILs have resulted in a wide
array of scientific and industrial applications.7−9 For these applications,
it is important to understand the physicochemical properties of ILs
as Coulomb systems. Accordingly, the elucidation of the nature of
noncovalent interactions in ILs that include Coulomb forces, hydrogen
bonds, and dispersion forces as well as the liquid structure of ILs
are crucial.10−13 Experimentally, infrared (IR), Raman, and NMR spectroscopies have
been utilized as fundamental and powerful tools for characterizing
ILs,14−16 which provided us with significant insights into
the assignment of vibrational modes, hydrogen bond-type interactions,
and molecular conformations. Computational studies have also been
extensively performed to address the noncovalent interactions and
the liquid structure of ILs.17−20 The low-frequency intermolecular vibrational modes
have been studied by using far IR (FIR) spectroscopy and terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS).21−29 In determining the center frequencies of the broad absorption band
below 150 cm–1 for some imidazolium-based ILs, the
major contribution of the force constant in the angular frequency
of the harmonic oscillator, ω = (k/μ)1/2, and the significance of the local and directional hydrogen
bond were pointed out.22−24 On the other hand, we previously reported that THz-TDS
and FIR spectroscopy can directly explore the intermolecular vibrations
because of the cation–anion interactions in methylimidazolium
ILs that originated in Coulomb interactions and hydrogen-bond-type
interactions and argued that the central frequencies of intermolecular
vibrations are on the essential contribution of the reduced mass μ
calculated from the respective masses of the methylimidazolium ring
cation [mim+] and the anion [A–] as well
as the force constant k, which was established for a wide variety
of methylimidazolium ILs.26−28 In IR spectroscopic studies for
imidazolium-based ILs, +C(2)–H stretching vibration,
and +C(4/5)–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching
vibrations in the 3000–3200 cm–1 range were
intensively investigated28−38 because most characteristic features of local hydrogen-bond-type
interactions appear in the frequency range; that is, the red-shifted +C–H stretching vibrations in +C–H···A– interactions are the experimental evidence for hydrogen-bond-type
interactions. We systematically discussed the correlation between
the +C–H stretching vibrational frequencies, the
chemical shift (δ ppm) of the corresponding proton obtained
from the NMR spectra, and the center frequencies of intermolecular
vibrational modes because of ion pairs obtained from THz-TDS and FIR.26−28 In other IR frequency ranges, extensive studies on the assignment
of vibrational modes and molecular conformers have been performed
for various ILs, and Paschoal et al. recently systematically reviewed
the vibrational spectroscopy of ILs.39

In this paper, we systematically investigated the 700–950
cm–1 range in IR spectroscopy for various methylimidazolium
ILs. Two main bands of the methylimidazolium cation exist in this
region. At 700–800 cm–1, there is an out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode
with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H, which is coupled
with small motions of the alkyl-chain part. At 800–950 cm–1, there is an out-of-plane +C(2)–H
and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion
of +C(2)–H. The investigation of these bands that
are related to the motions of +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H is very important, whereas these bands have been
rarely explored.26 We found that the molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance of the former band at 700–800 cm–1 is partly affected by anti/gauche conformations of the alkyl-chain
part, and the molar-concentration-normalized absorbance of the latter
band at 800–950 cm–1 is nearly identical
in terms of the intensities and bandshapes for ILs that have methylimidazolium
cations with carbon chains of different lengths and the same anions,
whose validity was established for a wide range of methylimidazolium
ILs. Moreover, the band shape of the latter band is highly sensitive
to the interactions with anions and, interestingly, both blue- and
red-shifted tendencies in the spectrum for each system were observed.

Experimental
Section
Various kinds of alkyl-methylimidazolium ILs shown
in Figure 1 were investigated.
The standard abbreviations of [Cnmim+] for alkyl-methylimidazolium cations and some anions are
used in this paper.

Figure 1 Alkyl-methylimidazolium ILs investigated in this study.

The methylimidazolium ILs were
purchased from Kanto Chemical Co.,
Tokyo, Japan, or Merck Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The ILs were all highly
pure (>98%), and some IL samples with water miscibility were dried
for 24 h under a vacuum condition before using. Details concerning
the experimental procedure and apparatus are given elsewhere; briefly,
Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with an attenuated
total reflection (ATR) unit was used to record the IR absorption spectra
of the IL samples.26−28 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
performed for methylimidazolium cations and molecular anions, where
the geometries and the vibrational spectra were calculated at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p).

Results
and Discussion
First, we show the calculated vibrational
spectra in the 700–950
cm–1 range of [C2mim+], [C3mim+], [C4mim+], [C6mim+], [C8mim+], and [C10mim+], as shown in Figure 2a,b. In Figure 2a, the vibrational spectra of [Cnmim+] with all trans-conformations of the alkyl-chain
part were calculated, whereas in Figure 2b, those of [Cnmim+] with all gauche-conformations of the alkyl-chain
part were calculated for simplicity, where all gauche-conformers of
[Cnmim+], in which Cn is greater or equal to C4, are meaningful.

Figure 2 (a) Calculated
vibrational spectra of [Cnmim+] with n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and
10, having all trans-conformations of the alkyl-chain part and (b)
calculated vibrational spectra of [Cnmim+] with n = 4, 6, 8, and 10, having all gauche
conformations of the alkyl-chain part. The absorption bandwidth was
set at 5 cm–1 for the absorption bands to make them
easily visible.

In Figure 2a, we
can find two main bands for all [Cnmim+]. The first is an out-of-plane +C(2)–H
and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion
of +C(2)–H in the imidazolium ring with the peak
at 830–835 cm–1 and nearly the same intensity.
The second is an out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H in the imidazolium ring with the peak at 750–755
cm–1 and nearly the same intensity. Thus, these
two main vibrational modes are the vibrational modes within the imidazolium
ring, essentially. There are vibrational modes at 730–740 cm–1 with a moderately strong intensity, which mainly
originate from the rocking motions of the alkyl-chain part. Accordingly,
the peak frequencies and intensities differ depending on the alkyl-chain
length of [Cnmim+] and no peak
for [C2mim+]. In actual ILs, the peak at 750–755
cm–1 and the peaks at 730–740 cm–1 tend to overlap. There are very small peaks at around 800 and 900
cm–1, depending on the alkyl-chain length. In Figure 2b, we can find two
main bands for all [Cnmim+].
The origin of the two main bands is the same as explained in Figure 2a. There are vibrational
modes at 720–740 cm–1, which mainly originate
from motions of the alkyl chain part with all gauche conformations.
The vibrational modes exist in a wider frequency region compared with
those in Figure 2a,
and the peak frequencies and intensities differ. There are small peaks
at around 800 and 900 cm–1, depending on the alkyl-chain
length. As an example, the vibrational modes at 834, 754, and 736
cm–1, which are two main vibrational modes and the
rocking mode of the alkyl-chain part with a moderately strong intensity,
are illustrated for [C6mim+] with all trans
conformations of the alkyl-chain part in Figure 3a–c, respectively.

Figure 3 Calculated vibrational
modes at (a) 834, (b) 754, and (c) 736 cm–1 for
[C6mim+] with all trans
conformations of the alkyl-chain part. The out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a
larger motion of +C(2)–H at 834 cm–1 and the out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H
bending mode with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H at
754 cm–1 were schematically illustrated, where the
sizes of the circles near “H”s represent
the magnitude of the motions.

Figure 4a–j
shows the molar concentration normalized absorbance spectra in the
700–950 cm–1 range obtained by ATR–FTIR
and density measurements for various kinds of alkyl-methylimidazolium
ILs, as shown in Figure 1. The original ATR–IR spectra in the 700–950 cm–1 range are shown (see Figure S1a–j, Supporting Information).

Kim et al. reported that the penetration depth
change arising in
relation to differences in refractive indices under the ATR geometry
is of little consequence, and IR measurements in transmission geometry
bring in very similar results for some imidazolium-based ILs.38 We also previously showed the usefulness of
molar concentration normalized absorbance spectra in the 2800–3300
cm–1 range for various imidazolium-based ILs.28 Because the molar concentration normalization
is equivalent to the normalization by the number of ion pairs, the
molar-concentration-normalized absorption spectra enable us to distinguish
the vibrational modes, whose absorption intensities and frequencies
are decided by the number of ion pairs from the vibrational modes
whose absorption intensities and frequencies are not decided by the
number of ion pairs; for instance, vibrational modes depending on
alkyl-chain length and its conformation of imidazolium cations. In Figure 4, we found that the
molar-concentration-normalized absorbance spectra in the 800–950
cm–1 range for IL samples that have methylimidazolium
cations with carbon chains of different lengths and the same anions
are nearly identical as for absorption intensities and absorption
frequencies, whereas those in the 700–800 cm–1 range are moderately identical.

First, we discuss molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance spectra
in the 700–800 cm–1 range. According to the
calculations shown in Figure 2, there are out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H with the peak at 750–755 cm–1 and the strong intensity, vibrational modes at 730–740 cm–1 with moderately strong intensities that are related
to motions of alkyl-chain part for trans-conformers, vibrational modes
at 720–740 cm–1 with moderately strong intensities
that are related to motions of alkyl-chain part for gauche conformers.
Hereinafter, we call the out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(4,5)–H as the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H
bending mode. Because of the broadening of absorption bands in actual
ILs, the peak at 750–755 cm–1 and the peaks
at 730–740 cm–1 and the peaks at 720–740
cm–1 tend to overlap. Additionally, in the 700–800
cm–1 range, there are IR-active vibrational modes
of anions of [SCN–], [TfO–], [Tf2N–], and [PF3(C2F5)3–]. Particularly for [Cnmim+][Tf2N–] ILs and [C6mim+][PF3(C2F5)3–] IL, very strong absorption
bands because of [PF3(C2F5)3–] and [Tf2N–] exist
as shown in Figure 4, which makes it difficult to analyze the vibrational modes of imidazolium
cations in this range. Therefore, we do not analyze the data in the
700–800 cm–1 range for [Cnmim+][Tf2N–] ILs and
[C6mim+][PF3(C2F5)3–] IL.

In Figure 4a–c
for [Cnmim+][Cl–] ILs, [Cnmim+][Br–] ILs, and [Cnmim+][I–] ILs, we found a very broad absorption band for [Cnmim+][Cl–] and
[Cnmim+][Br–] and a broad absorption band for [Cnmim+][I–] with the peak at around 745–765
cm–1. The main contribution of this band is the
out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode, and part of
the contribution of this band is due to vibrational modes that are
related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part. Weak peak or shoulderlike
structures in the 720–730 cm–1 range for
[Cnmim+][Cl–], [Cnmim+][Br–], and [Cnmim+][I–] with a long alkyl chain of n = 6, 8, or 10 suggest
the contribution of gauche conformations in the alkyl-chain part.
In return, we can recognize the existence of gauche conformations
in the alkyl-chain part for these IL systems. In Figure 4d for [Cnmim+][SCN–] ILs, we found a broad
absorption band with shoulderlike structures at 750–760 cm–1 and a weak peak or shoulderlike structure at 730–740
cm–1. The main contribution of this band is the
out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode, and a part
of the contribution of this band is due to vibrational modes that
are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part and a vibrational
mode of the anion. According to the calculation in Figure 2a, the vibrational modes that
are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part exist at 730–740
cm–1. Moreover, [SCN–] has a vibrational
mode at 730 cm–1 (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). These two contributions lead to the
elevation of the absorption intensity at 730–740 cm–1. The out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode may exist
at around 750–760 cm–1. In Figure 4e for [Cnmim+][N(CN)2–] ILs,
we found a broad absorption band with a peak at around 750–760
cm–1. The main contribution of this band is the
out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode, and a part
of the contribution of this band is due to vibrational modes that
are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part. There are no IR-active
vibrational modes for [N(CN)2–] in the
700–800 cm–1 range. In Figure 4f for [Cnmim+][TfO–] ILs, we found a broad band with
a peak at around 750–760 cm–1. The main contribution
of this band is the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending
mode, and part of the contribution of this band is due to vibrational
modes that are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part and
the vibrational modes of the anion. According to the calculation,
[TfO–] has a vibrational mode at 735 cm–1 (see Figure S3, Supporting Information). In the actual IL systems, the vibrational mode of [TfO–] may exist at around 750–760 cm–1 and the
contribution is superimposed as a sharp peak structure. The shoulderlike
structures in the 720–730 cm–1 region for
[Cnmim+][TfO–] with a long alkyl-chain of n = 6 and 8 indicate
the existence of gauche conformations in the alkyl-chain part. In Figure 4h, for [Cnmim+][BF4–] ILs, a broad absorption band with a peak at around 750–760
cm–1 was observed. The main contribution of this
band is the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode,
and part of the contribution of this band is due to vibrational modes
that are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part. There are
no IR-active vibrational modes for [BF4–] in the 700–800 cm–1 range. The shoulderlike
structures at 720–730 cm–1 for [Cnmim+][BF4–] with a long alkyl-chain of n = 6, 8, and 10 indicate
the existence of gauche conformations in the alkyl-chain part. In Figure 4i for [Cnmim+][PF6–] ILs, we found a broad band with a peak at around 750–760
cm–1 and a bump structure around at 740 cm–1. Although there are no IR-active vibrational modes for [PF6–] in the 700–800 cm–1 range (see Figure S4, Supporting Information), the totally symmetric stretching mode of [PF6–] that is not IR active for an isolated anion may become IR active
because of the condensed phase effect of the IL,40,41 which may appear as the bump structure. The main contribution of
this band is the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending
mode, and part of the contribution of this band is due to vibrational
modes that are related to the motions of the alkyl-chain part. [PF6–] has an extremely strong absorption band
with a peak at 810–820 cm–1, as shown in Figure 4i (824 cm–1 in the calculation) (see Figure S4, Supporting Information). The broad band with a peak at around 750–760
cm–1 is partly affected by the low-frequency side
of the extremely strong absorption band. Note that the scale of the
vertical axis in Figure 4i is significantly different from the others. As an overall view,
molar-concentration-normalized absorbance spectra at the 700–800
cm–1 region in Figure 4 are moderately identical for IL samples
that have methylimidazolium cations with carbon chains of different
lengths and the same anions, and the main contribution of the broad
band in the 700–800 cm–1 range is the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode, for which peaks exist at 745–765
cm–1, regardless of anion species. [Cl–] and [Br–] are very strong proton acceptors; [I–], [SCN–], and [N(CN)2–] are strong proton acceptors; [TfO–] is a relatively strong proton acceptor; and [Tf2N–], [BF4–], [PF6–], and [PF3(C2F5)3–] are assigned to weakly coordinated
anions.32−34 Accordingly, the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H
bending is not particularly sensitive to the local interactions with
anions, such as hydrogen-bond-type interactions, although the absorption
band in the 700–800 cm–1 range for [Cnmim+][Cl–] and
[Cnmim+][Br–] is broader in both the red and blue sides, compared with the other
IL samples.

Next, we discuss molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance spectra
in the 800–950 cm–1 range. Molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance spectra in the 800–950 cm–1 range
are nearly identical in terms of the absorption intensities, absorption
frequencies, and shapes of absorption bands for IL samples that have
methylimidazolium cations with carbon chains of different lengths
and the same anions. The tendency was surprisingly observed for a
wide range of methylimidazolium ILs. According to the calculations,
the main band in the 800–950 cm–1 region
for all [Cnmim+] is the out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode
with a larger motion of +C(2)–H, and the peaks at
around 800 and 900 cm–1 depending on the alkyl-chain
length are small. The data in the 800–950 cm–1 range in Figure 4 indicate that the out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(2)–H is essentially the intramolecular vibrations
within the imidazolium ring cation, and the absorption intensities,
absorption frequencies, and band shapes are determined by the number
of ion pairs and interactions with the counter anions. Hereinafter,
we refer to the out-of-plane +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending mode with a larger motion of +C(2)–H as the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending
mode. However, in the 800–950 cm–1 range,
there are IR-active vibrational modes of anions of [N(CN)2–], [PF6–], and [PF3(C2F5)3–]. Among these, [PF6–] and [PF3(C2F5)3–] have
very strong absorption bands in the 800–950 cm–1 range, as shown in Figure 4, which make it difficult to analyze the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending mode in this range. Accordingly, we
do not analyze the data in the 800–950 cm–1 range for [Cnmim+][PF6–] ILs and [C6mim+][PF3(C2F5)3–] IL. In Figure 4a,b,
we found a very broad absorption band for [Cnmim+][Cl–] ILs and [Cnmim+][Br–] ILs, which
covers from the red to the blue region at 800–950 cm–1. The very broad absorption band cannot be analyzed as a single Gaussian
peak. Accordingly, the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending
mode for [Cnmim+][Cl–] and [Cnmim+][Br–] strongly shows both blue- and red-shifted tendencies. In Figure 4c for [Cnmim+][I–] ILs, we found
a broad absorption band that has a red-shifted peak with the long
tail and a weak shoulder structure in the blue region. In Figure 4d for [Cnmim+][SCN–] ILs, we
found a broad absorption band that has a red-shifted peak with the
long tail in the blue region. In Figure 4e for [Cnmim+][N(CN)2–], we found a broad
absorption band that has a red-shifted peak with the long tail in
the blue region and an additional peak at around 900–910 cm–1 because of the vibrational mode of the anion (913
cm–1 in the calculation) (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). In Figure 4f for [Cnmim+][TfO–] ILs, we found a moderately
broad absorption band, whereas in Figure 4g,h for [Cnmim+][Tf2N–] ILs and [Cnmim+][BF4–] ILs, we found a simple absorption band. To proceed with further
analysis, we performed a multipeak fitting using the data at 800–920
cm–1 in Figure 4, as shown in Figure 5. Because the normalized absorbance spectra are nearly
identical concerning the absorption intensities, absorption frequencies,
and shapes of the absorption bands for IL samples that have methylimidazolium
cations with carbon chains of different lengths and the same anions,
the data of IL samples with [C6mim+] or [C4mim+] were representatively chosen.

Figure 5 Molar-concentration-normalized
absorbance spectra in the 800–920
cm–1 range for (a) [C6mim+][Cl–], (b) [C6mim+][Br–], (c) [C6mim+][I–], (d) [C4mim+][SCN–], (e)
[C4mim+][N(CN)2–], (f) [C6mim+][TfO–], (g)
[C6mim+][Tf2N–],
and (h) [C6mim+][BF4–]. Multipeak fitting was performed for each figure. The data in the
800–920 cm–1 range were fitted by one or
two Gaussian peaks shown as dotted lines. In (e), an additional Gaussian
peak at around 900–910 cm–1 because of the
vibrational mode of the anion was shown as a dot-dash line. In (h),
the data between 800 and 810 cm–1 were not used
for fitting because the data between 800 and 810 cm–1 includes the influence of the tail of the absorption band because
of the vibrational mode of the anion whose peak exists at the lower
frequency (see Figure 4h).

Interestingly in Figure 5, we found both blue- and red-shifted
tendencies in the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending mode
for each IL sample, although the
red-shifted portion is relatively larger than the blue-shifted portion.
The order of the red-shifted tendencies for anions is [Cl–], [Br–], [I–], [SCN–], [N(CN)2–], [TfO–], and [Tf2N–] ≈ [BF4]. The order of the blue-shifted tendencies for anions is [Cl–], [Br–], [I–]
≈ [SCN–] ≈ [N(CN)2–], [TfO–], and [Tf2N–] ≈ [BF4]. In fact, [Cnmim+][Tf2N–] and [Cnmim+][BF4–] do not show both red-shifted and blue-shifted
tendencies because these two were observed as a simple Gaussian peak.
In the present paper, we take the peak wavenumber (848 cm–1) of the +C(2)–H bending mode for [C6mim+][BF4–] as the reference
wavenumber to classify the bands as being shifted to lower value or
higher value. As an overall view, both red-shifted and blue-shifted
orders are well-correlated with the order of the hydrogen bond basicity.42 Highly characteristic behaviors are the fact
that the shifted tendencies of the out-of-plane +C(2)–H
bending mode are emphasized in both the red and blue sides by the
strength of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions. As far as stretching
modes are concerned, the hydrogen-bond-type interaction in +C(2)–H···A– interactions
for imidazolium-based ILs28,30−35,42,43 or the hydrogen bond in X–H···Y interactions
for the other general liquid systems have been thoroughly investigated.44−47 General spectroscopic features of the hydrogen bond formation in
stretching modes include the red shift of the peak position, the enhancement
of the intensity, and the broadening of the absorption band.39,44−46 The red shift of the peak because of the hydrogen-bond-type
interaction in +C(2)–H···A– interactions in imidazolium-based ILs has been explained as a lengthened
covalent bond (+C–H) by increasing the strength
of the hydrogen bond, which phenomenologically means a weaker force
constant of the intramolecular +C–H stretching mode.22−24,33 On the other hand, the blue-shifting
phenomena in stretching modes by the hydrogen bond formation have
been observed in some specific liquid systems. To interpret the origin
of the blue-shifting phenomena, numerous efforts have been made both
experimentally and computationally.48−52 It has been pointed out that whether it is the red
shift or blue shift is determined by the balance between the attractive
and repulsive interactions between (X, Y) and (Y, H).51 In the interactions of +C(2)–H···A– in imidazolium-based ILs and [H2O]···A– in imidazolium-based ILs in the presence of a slight
amount of water, the blue-shifting phenomena in stretching modes have
not been observed.28,33 As far as bending modes are concerned,
the hydrogen-bond-type interaction in [+C(2)–H]bending···A– interactions
in imidazolium-based ILs has rarely been studied.26 In some conventional liquids such as water, the hydrogen
bonds for the in-plane bending modes have been studied. In water systems,
the comparison between gas phase and liquid systems is possible, and
the bending modes exist at 1595 cm–1 in water vapor
(isolated water molecules) and 1645 cm–1 in liquid
water. Thus, the blue shift of 50 cm–1 was observed.
The shift of the water bending mode toward higher frequency is a measure
of stronger hydrogen bond networks, and the water bending mode has
been utilized as a suitable vibrational mode for studying the hydration
structure and dynamics of water.53−56 In IL systems, we should bear
in mind the fact that the comparison between gas-phase and liquid
systems is generally difficult because of their nonvolatility. In
return, we can investigate the hydrogen-bond-type interaction in [+C(2)–H]bending···A– interactions for various imidazolium-based ILs with different anion
species. Interestingly, in the present studies, we found that the
shifted tendencies because of the hydrogen bonding in [+C(2)–H]bending···A– interactions are emphasized in both the red and blue sides by the
strength of the hydrogen bonding, which means that both weaker and
stronger force constants of intramolecular +C(2)–H
bending mode because of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions exist
phenomenologically. In general, hydrogen bonds are the local and directional
interactions. Intramolecular +C(2)–H bending mode
under the hydrogen-bond-type interactions may be sensitive to the
relative positions and orientations between +C(2)–H
and A– and their distributions, which make both
weaker and stronger force constants of intramolecular +C(2)–H bending mode phenomenologically. Our data provide insights
on the strength, relative positions and orientations, and their distributions
involved in hydrogen-bond-type interactions, which also related to
the hydrogen-bond network in IL systems.57,58 The study of the dynamics of intramolecular +C(2)–H
bending mode would be interesting.

Finally, we discuss the correlation
between the concentration-normalized
absorbance of imidazolium-based ILs because of the +C(2)–H
stretching vibration and the +C(4/5)–H stretching
vibration in the 3000 and 3200 cm–1 region, the
center frequency of the broad absorption band below 150 cm–1 because of intermolecular vibrations in our previous study,26−28 and the concentration normalized absorbance because of the +C(2)–H bending vibration and the +C(4,5)–H
bending vibration in the 700 and 950 cm–1 region
in the present study. For the +C(2)–H and +C(4/5)–H stretching vibrations in the 3000 and 3200 cm–1 region, the molar-concentration-normalized absorbance
for ILs that have methylimidazolium cations with carbon chains of
different lengths and same anions were nearly identical regarding
the absorption intensities and frequencies and absorption band shapes,
which were determined by the number of ion pairs.28 This essentially holds for the +C(2)–H
bending vibration and the +C(4,5)–H bending vibration
in the 700–950 cm–1 region, although the
absorption bands in the 700–800 cm–1 region
are moderately identical because of the influence of the vibrations
of the alkyl-chain part and anions. For the +C(4/5)–H
symmetric stretching vibration observed as a higher frequency absorption
band in the 3000 and 3200 cm–1 region, the absorption
frequency was slightly red-shifted or almost unchanged with the strengthening
of hydrogen-bond-type interactions with the anion.28 For the +C(4,5)–H bending vibration,
the peaks of the absorption bands exist at 745–765 cm–1 regardless of the anion species, and it is not particularly sensitive
to the strength of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions. For very strong
proton acceptors [Cl–] and [Br–], the absorption bands are a little broader to both the red and
blue sides. Accordingly, close correlations between the +C(4/5)–H symmetric stretching vibration and the +C(4,5)–H bending vibration were observed, which was shown
to be valid for a wide range of methylimidazolium ILs. For the +C(2)–H stretching vibration that exists at lower frequency
in the 3000 and 3200 cm–1 region, the absorption
band becomes broader and the peaks of the absorption band are red-shifted
with the strengthening of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions or proton
acceptor of anions.28 For the +C(2)–H bending vibration, the absorption band becomes broader
and has both red- and blue-shifted tendencies with the strengthening
of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions or proton acceptor of anions.
Moreover, regardless of the differences in the frequency regions or
the differences in the types of the mode, we note that the absorption
band shapes of [Cnmim+][I–], [Cnmim+][SCN–], and [Cnmim+][N(CN)2–] with strong acceptors, and
the absorption band shapes of [Cnmim+][Tf2N–] and [Cnmim+][BF4–] with weakly
coordinated anions are similar in each frequency region or mode. Accordingly,
close correlations between the +C(2)–H stretching
vibration and the +C(2)–H bending vibration were
observed, which was shown to be valid for a wide range of methylimidazolium
ILs.

In the previous and present studies, we investigated the
influence
of hydrogen-bond-type interaction in [+C–H]bending···A– and +C–H···A– interactions. It
should be noted that the red-shifted +C–H stretching
vibrations in the 3000–3200 cm–1 region and
both red- and blue-shifted +C–H bending vibrations
in the 700–950 cm–1 region were observed
by the frequency change of intramolecular vibrational modes interacting
with anions with IR spectroscopy. Accordingly, these vibrations are
thought to be more sensitive to the local interactions such as hydrogen-bond-type
interactions. On the other hand, THz-TDS and FIR spectroscopy can
directly explore intermolecular vibrations because of the cation–anion
interactions that include Coulomb interactions as well as local and
directional hydrogen-bond-type interactions. We previously found that
the central frequencies of intermolecular vibrational modes phenomenologically
are on the essential contribution of the reduced mass μ calculated
from the respective masses of the methylimidazolium ring cation [mim+] and the anion [A–] as well as the force
constant k, which is established for a wide variety
of methylimidazolium ILs.26−28 The correlation between the intramolecular +C–H stretching vibrations (or +C–H
bending vibration) and the intermolecular vibration is not necessarily
observed for a wide range of methylimidazolium ILs.

Conclusions
We systematically investigated the 700–950 cm–1 range of IR spectroscopy for imidazolium-based ILs in conjunction
with the data with DFT calculations. In this range, there are two
main and important vibrational modes (out-of-plane +C(2)–H
bending mode and out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending
mode) for studying the nature of interactions between cation and anions,
especially on the hydrogen-bond-type interaction in ILs. We found
that the normalized absorbance spectra in the 700–800 cm–1 range for IL samples that have methylimidazolium
cations with carbon chains of different lengths and the same anions
are moderately identical as for absorption intensities and absorption
frequencies, and that those in the 800–950 cm–1 range are nearly identical, which means that the absorption intensities
and frequencies and the absorption band shapes are decided by the
number of ion pairs and the interactions between ion pairs. With respect
to the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode, we found
that the out-of-plane +C(4,5)–H bending mode is
not particularly sensitive to local interactions with anions, such
as hydrogen-bond-type interactions. With respect to the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending mode, we found that the absorption band
becomes broader and has both red-and blue-shifted tendencies with
the strengthening of the hydrogen-bond-type interactions or the proton
acceptor of anions, although the red-shifted portion is relatively
larger than the blue-shifted portion. Accordingly, the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending mode is highly sensitive to local and
directional hydrogen-bond-type interactions, and the shifted tendencies
of the out-of-plane +C(2)–H bending mode are very
characteristic and interesting. Intramolecular +C(2)–H
bending mode under the hydrogen-bond-type interactions may be sensitive
to the relative positions and orientations between +C(2)–H
and A– and their distributions. We also discussed
the correlation between the concentration-normalized absorbance of
imidazolium-based ILs because of +C(2)–H and +C(4/5)–H stretching vibrations, +C(2)–H
and +C(4,5)–H bending vibrations, and low-frequency
intermolecular vibrations. We found a close correlation between +C(2)–H and +C(4/5)–H stretching vibrations
and +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending
vibrations for a wide range of imidazolium-based IL systems, whereas
the correlation between these intramolecular vibrations and the low-frequency
intermolecular vibrations is not necessarily observed for a wide range
of imidazolium-based IL systems. Our systematic data and analysis
on the +C(2)–H and +C(4,5)–H bending
vibrations obtained in the present paper and comparisons with other
theoretical and experimental studies are useful for elucidating the
nature of noncovalent interaction in imidazolium-based ILs such as
long-range Coulomb interactions, dispersion interactions, hydrogen-bond-type
interactions, and their networks.
