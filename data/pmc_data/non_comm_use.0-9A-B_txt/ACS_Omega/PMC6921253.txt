A graphene-based or carbon-based aerogel is a three-dimensional
(3D) solid material in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a sheet-like
nanostructure. In this study, we report the synthesis of low-density
polymer-modified aerogel monoliths by 3D macroassemblies of graphene
oxide sheets that exhibit significant internal surface areas (982
m2/g) and high electrical conductivity (∼0.1 to
1 × 102 S/cm). Different types of materials were prepared
to obtain a single monolithic solid starting from a suspension of
single-layer graphene oxide (GO) sheets and a polymer, made from the
precursors 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and poly(vinyl alcohol). These materials
were used to cross-link the individual sheets by covalent bonds, resulting
in wet-gels that were supercritically dried and then, in some cases,
thermally reduced to yield graphene aerogel composites. The average
densities were approaching 15–20 mg/cm3. This approach
allowed for the modulation of the distance between the sheets, pore
dimension, surface area, and related properties. This specific GO/polymer
ratio has suitable malleability, making it a viable conductive material
for use in 3D printing; it also has other properties suitable for
energy storage, catalysis, sensing and biosensing applications, bioelectronics,
and superconductors.

1 Introduction
Graphene and graphene oxide are one-atom-thick planar two-dimensional
(2D) sheets of carbon atoms, sp2-bonded, with a dense honeycomb-packed
crystal lattice. The distinctive natural disposition of carbon atoms
gives them a unique set of properties such as electronic, chemical,
and mechanical.1−4

In the past few years, a significant
number of researches have shown the potential applications of graphene-based
sheets and their impact in a wide range of technologies including
energy storage,5−9 especially supercapacitors,10,11 catalysis,12−15 sensing,9,12,16 and mechanically enhanced composites.17−19 However, three-dimensional (3D)
structures based on this extraordinary nanomaterial have not been
well studied, and their synthesis or fabrication is limited to a few
methods.20−30

Aerogels are 3D materials with open-cell foam
structures, high relative surface areas, and nanoscale pores and cell
sizes. One of the first developed and most commonly known aerogel
is silica aerogel.31−33 More
recently, it has been demonstrated that graphene can be used as a
building material for carbon-based aerogels composed of a network
of different clustered carbon nanostructures.34−36 Carbon-based aerogels show some similar
properties to silica aerogels but with different mechanical behaviors
and a capacity for electrical conductivity that depends heavily on
their density.37−40 Some interactions with light have also been
reported. Specifically, carbon-based aerogels can absorb light in
the visible and infrared spectra (they reflect only 0.3% of radiation
between 250 nm and 14.3 μm).41,42 The thermal
conductivity of carbon aerogels tends to be equal to or less than
air because these solids conduct heat only through thin chains of
atoms, except in the case of some specific structural modifications.43−46 It
would be desirable to develop three-dimensional composite nanostructures
with the extraordinary functionalities of graphene and other materials
that modulate aerogel properties.

Previous reports focused on
the high stability of graphene oxide (GO) suspensions to assemble
an initial GO macrostructure, which was then thermally reduced to
yield a 3D graphene network.23,24 Others used a polymer
to reinforce the structure47 because the
GO aerogel (GOA) structure is usually maintained by noncovalent cross-link-like
van der Waals forces without any chemoelectric bonds.48 This resulted in a relative surface area lower than that
of the 2D-GO,49 and the bulk electrical
conductivities of these assemblies only reached approximately 5 ×
10–1 S/cm48,50 even in the case of
metal doping.50 This value is about 5 orders
of magnitude lower than the conductivity reported for single graphene
sheets.50 Taken together, these and other
results51,52 underscore the importance of generating
or determining the physical bonds between the GO sheets while maintaining
the original properties, which would increase the potential utility
of 3D graphene macroassemblies.

In our study, we present a new
method to obtain low-density graphene aerogels with high electrical
conductivity and large surface areas starting from GO, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde
(4-CBA), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to create an intrinsically
conducting polymer (ICP) by dehydrogenation.53,54 Also,
to obtain a conductive polymer during the first synthesis phase, another
critical aspect in fabricating these macroassemblies was the formation
of covalently bonded junctions between the ICP and individual graphene
oxide sheets to reinforce the structure and provide electrical conductive
interconnections between the sheets. The method presented here utilizes
a precursor obtained by 4-CBA and PVA, (poly(4-formylperoxibenzoyl)acetylene),
to knit together graphene oxide sheets into a macroscopic 3D structure.
With this approach, we are able to produce monolithic graphene oxide
architectures with low densities (approaching 15–20 mg/cm3) and electrical conductivities more than 2 orders of magnitude
higher than those reported for other graphene aerogels.50 Furthermore, the relative surface areas are
lower but comparable to the areas reported for 2D graphene sheets.49,50

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Sample Preparation
The first two
steps of our synthesis involved the preparation of the graphene oxide
using the Hummers approach55 to oxidize
graphene flakes. The graphene oxide was then added to absolute ethanol
(99.9%, Beijing Tongguang) to create a suspension. The solid content
in the graphene oxide suspension may range from about 0.1 to about
25 mg/mL, as shown in Table 1. The suspensions were dispersed using a Shumei KQ-250DB ultrasonicator
(frequency ∼ 40 kHz, sonic power ∼ 80 W). Six cycles
of 15 min each of ultrasonication alternated with 15 min of stops
were used to exfoliate the graphite oxide, and a sol–gel solution
was finally obtained. It is crucial in this phase to reduce the time
of each cycle and increase the number of cycles to avoid an increase
of temperature of the solution and consequently a loss of functional
groups on the surface of the single GO sheet. Any loss of oxygen on
the GO surface could have negative effects on the formation of the
covalent bonds with the polymer. Therefore, this phase is extremely
important and must be executed with maximum precision and attention.

the surface of the sheets.

and indication of the site (*) for the bonding with GO.

The optimal conditions for GO dispersions
were evaluated by a range of sonication cycles from 15 to 120 min.

The ICP precursor was prepared in a solution of ethanol and Millipore
water ranging from 0:1 to 99.9:1 v/v ratio using 4-carboxybenzaldehyde
98%, Alfa Aesar (it is possible to choose similar molecules with one
carboxylic functional group), and a long-chain polymer with at least
two hydroxyl groups (such as poly(vinyl alcohol) >99% hydrolyzed, Mw 146 000–186 000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich).
Hydroiodic acid (57 wt % in water) 0.1 wt % with respect to the PVA
amount was used as a catalyst,53 under
stirring for 2 h. All of the samples presented in this work were prepared
using 99.9:0.1 v/v EtOH/H2O.

2.2 Characterization
Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed on an FE-SEM LEO Supra
55 VP along with a GEMINI column (Carl Zeiss, Germany) 5–10
keV (20 mA) in in-lens secondary electron imaging mode with a working
distance of 2–8 mm, equipped with an Oxford Instrument Energy
Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX) analytical instrument.

Electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry (EMXnano, Bruker, Germany)
was applied for the detection of radicals during and after the reaction.
The parameters for EPR measurements were set with a modulation frequency
of 100 kHz, a microwave frequency of 9.61 GHz, microwave power of
1.26 mW (19 dB), modulation amplitude of 2.0 G, a sweep width of 200
G, a time constant of 1.28 ms, and five scans. A nitrone spin trapping
agent (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide ≥97%,
DMPO, Sigma Aldrich) was used to form stable spin adducts with radicals.

Relative surface area and pore volume analyses were performed by
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods by an ASAP 2000 Surface Area Analyzer (Micromeritics
Instrument Corporation).

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the primary and the
fitting EPR spectra of DMPO adducts. Spinfit results showed that in
our reaction system, two kinds of radicals including hydroxyl and
peroxyl radicals were formed, and the concentrations of hydroxyl and
peroxyl radicals were 6.908 × 1011 and 2.300 ×
1012 spins/mm3, respectively. Control experiments
showed that no radicals were formed (Figures 3–5), which confirmed that hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals were
produced in our reaction system.

The formation of the wet-gel
was first activated by the addition of the polymer solution to the
GO solution and a mechanical shock and was then transferred to a Teflon
Becker, sealed and cured in a water bath at 87 °C for 5 h. Sodium
carbonate (anhydrous, 0.1 wt % with respect to 4-CBA, Beijing Chemicals
W.) was used as a catalyst. Polymer/GO wt ratio is typically in the
range of about 0.1:1 to about 5:1. Depending on the application and
the chemical/mechanical properties expected, other ratios could be
suitable.

The resulted wet-gel was dried using an SFE-0.5 dryer
using supercritical CO2 at pressures of 7.5 to 8.0 ±
0.1 MPa and temperatures between 50.0 and 55.0 ± 0.5 °C.
The system works with a flow rate of 1 L × h–1 using a separation chamber for the elimination of the extracted
solvent and to obtain the samples shown in Figure 6. Some samples were pyrolyzed at 200 °C
under N2 atmosphere for 6 h to reduce all of the graphene
oxide to graphene. Any thermal treatment of the aerogel should be
conducted under conditions that avoid the decomposition of the polymer
network. A typical range should be about 120 to 450 °C.

FE-SEM showed a random and densely oriented 3D network sheet-like
structures of the graphene aerogel (Figure 7a,d) similar to those seen in previous reports.35,56 The sizes of the sheets ranged from hundreds of nanometers to several
micrometers. Using a higher magnification, the GO sheets network was
thin enough to be transparent (Figure 7a).

It is possible to observe the porosity from a nanometer scale to micrometer.
The images refer to GOA6 (a), GOA5 (b), GOA4 (c), and GOA3 (d).

We did not observe any agglomeration or nanoparticles
of polymer on the graphene oxide sheets or other sites, although more
than half of the weight in the aerogel was attributed to the polymer.
When the ICP/GO wt % ratio was more than 1:1, the polymerization and
the formation of the GOA did not occur. It is also clear that a synthesis
where the junctions are mediated by carbonyl and carboxyl functional
groups instead of hydroxyl groups prevents the formation of polymer
random-coils.57−61 In this case,
the physical cross-links occur preferentially at the oxygen on the
surface of the graphene oxide forming covalent bonds between individual
sheets and the polymer formed a single macroassembly structure. The
EDX analysis shows mainly carbon in all of the samples. Traces of
iodine and calcium were found in sample GOA3.

Determination
of the bulk densities was obtained from the physical dimensions and
mass of each sample.

To measure the relative surface area and
the pore volume, approximately 0.1 g of each sample was heated to
150 °C under vacuum (10–5 Torr) overnight (at
least 12 h) to remove all adsorbed species. The list of results is
reported in Table 2. The sample GOA1, GOA2, and GOA7 were not measured because of the
reasons explained in the notes of Table 1.

The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherm for the ICP-GO aerogel (Figure 8) showed a type IV curve, indicating that
the material is mesoporous. The type three hysteresis loop62,63 occurred at high relative pressure and was associated with adsorption
in the nanoporous structures, consistent with the aggregates observed
using FE-SEM. The pore size distribution for the aerogel was determined
by the BJH method,62 which showed no clear
distribution of the pore volume with three different macrogroups:
one lay in the 10–50 nm range, most in 50–500 nm range,
and a little in the 500–1000 nm range (Table 2 and Figures 8 and 9). The peak pore diameter
was 126 nm. The BET surface area64−66 for the aerogel strongly depended on the ratio between
the polymer and GO during the synthesis, and the higher value was
982 m2/g. The theoretical value of the surface area for
a single graphene oxide sheet is about 2600 m2/g,50,67 but our samples showed lower values probably due to layering or
overlapping of graphene oxide sheets within the assembly. Nevertheless,
the measured surface area was higher than other values reported for
high-quality GO aerogels prepared via hydrogen arc discharge,49 or GO-RF,35,43 and it was three times
higher than that of the CNT aerogel.68

aerogels.

Figure 9 Pore size distribution of the samples GOA0, GOA3, GOA4,
GOA5, and GOA6.

The four-probe method was used to measure the electrical conductivity
with metal electrodes attached to the ends of cylindrical samples.
Current (100 mA) was transmitted through the sample during the measurement,
and the voltage drop was measured over distances of 6 to 7 mm. At
least 10 measurements were taken on each sample, and results were
averaged and reported in Table 2.

The bulk electrical conductivity (Table 3) of the polymer-modified graphene
oxide aerogel was (sample GOA6) 128 S/cm, about 2–3 orders
of magnitude higher than those reported for other 3D graphene materials
prepared with other methods.48,50 It is our opinion that
this extraordinarily high conductivity and not the intuitively U-I
behavior (Figure 10) is due to a rearrangement in the network morphology (many ripples
in fixed positions) of the graphene oxide sheets in a 3D system. In
congruence with the morphological differences, a substantial reduction
in resistance at the connections between graphene sheets compared
to those at the van der Waals bonds along with the use of an intrinsically
conducting polymer could increase the mobility of the electrons and
phonons. A more detailed discussion about the theoretical nature and
the behavior of the charges in our polymer-modified aerogel will be
presented in a forthcoming paper.

In conclusion, we prepared
a macroscopic 3D polymer composite graphene oxide aerogel with large
surface area and high electrical conductivity. Our approach used one
molecule with a carboxyl and a carbonyl functional group to bind the
hydroxyl group to a second molecule. It was used because of its long
chain that could obtain conjugated bonds andto space out the graphene
oxide sheets. We were able to modulate the density, the pore dimension,
and the conductivity just by changing the polymer/GO ratio. Due to
these properties, these 3D graphene assemblies have potential relevance
in a large number of applications as conductive 3D printing, energy
storage, electrocatalysis, sensors and biosensors, and electro-biointerfaces.
