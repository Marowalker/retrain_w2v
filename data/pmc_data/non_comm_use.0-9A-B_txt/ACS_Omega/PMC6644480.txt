Osteosarcoma is an aggressive
form of bone cancer mostly affecting
young people. To date, the most effective strategy for the treatment
of osteosarcoma is the surgical removal of the tumor with or without
combinational chemotherapy. In this study, we present the development
of a pH-sensitive drug-delivery system in the form of microparticles,
with increased chemotherapeutic action against the osteosarcoma cell
line SAOS-2, and with reduced toxicity against the heart myoblastic
cell line H9C2. The delivery system is composed of calcium carbonate
and collagen type I, and is loaded with cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (<25 nm) and the anticancer drug doxorubicin.
The fabricated microparticles were fully characterized morphologically
and physicochemically, and their ability to induce or inhibit apoptosis/necrosis
was assessed using in vitro functional assays and flow cytometry.
The results presented in this study show that the highest concentration
(250 μg/mL) of the therapeutic microparticles (CaCO3-based therapeutic modulators (C-TherMods)), which corresponds to
6.4 μg/mL of encapsulated doxorubicin, can protect the H9C2
cells even after 120 h, since the percentage of viable cells at this
time point is 65%. On the contrary, when H9C2 cells are treated with
0.5 μg/mL of free doxorubicin, 75% of the cells are dead only
after 24 h. When SAOS-2 cells are treated with the same concentration
of C-TherMods (250 μg/mL), the viability of SAOS-2 cells is
80% after 24 h, while it reduces to 50% after 120 h. At pH 6.0, the
synergic effect of the pro-oxidant CeO2 nanoparticles and
of the encapsulated doxorubicin leads to almost 100% of cell death,
even at the lowest concentration of C-TherMods (50 μg/mL).

==== Body
Background
Osteogenic
sarcoma (or osteosarcoma) is a form of malignant tumor
that affects mostly young people below the age of 25 and elderly above
the age of 60. It has a 5 year survival rate of 80%, which is dramatically
reduced in the case of metastasis.1−3 The current treatment
for osteosarcoma comprises the use of chemotherapeutic drugs before
the surgical removal of the tumor (neoadjuvant therapy), as well as
after its removal (adjuvant therapy). The most common chemotherapeutic
agents are doxorubicin (DOX), methotrexate, cisplatin, ifosfamide,
and etoposide, as well as combinations of them. Although the use of
these chemotherapeutics leads to a significant reduction of the tumor
and an increase in the survival rate of the patients, it also leads
to vital side effects, some of which are alopecia, myelosuppression,
mucositis, nausea, and vomiting. Besides this, deaths due to acute
toxicity have also been reported, especially in the case of DOX. More specifically,
the toxic effects caused by DOX are related to the intensity and the
total cumulative dose that is given to a patient, with a significant
increase in heart failure when the administered dose is above 550
mg/m2.2,4

Aiming at increasing the
therapeutic effect and decreasing the
side effects of the existing chemotherapeutics, various drug-delivery
systems (DDS) based on organic and/or inorganic materials for the
treatment of various types of cancer, as well as for other diseases,
have been developed.5−16 These systems allow for a better bioavailability, pharmacokinetics,
controlled and sustained release of the encapsulated therapeutic agents,
and specific targeting properties, those overall enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of the administered drugs. Of the inorganic materials, the
ones that are mostly used for the fabrication of DDS are gold, silicon,
iron oxide, calcium phosphate, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3).17

CaCO3 in the form
of microparticles, microspheres, and
nanoparticles has been robustly used in drug delivery for the treatment
of various types of cancer, including osteosarcoma, due to certain
attractive characteristics such as its high biocompatibility, slow
biodegradation, osteoconductivity, controlled and sustained release
of various chemotherapeutics, and pH-sensitive properties.17−21

Collagen is one of the main components of the bone, along
with
bone minerals made mostly of calcium and phosphate salts. Collagen-based
structures in the form of microspheres,22 hydrogels,23−25 and fibers26,27 find use in many biomedical
applications, such as drug-delivery systems for the treatment of cancer
or applications related to tissue engineering, mostly due to the high
biocompatibility and low immunogenicity that they present.

Overproduction
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the main
characteristics that cancerous tissues present, and recently, many
studies that demonstrate reduction of malignant tumors through ROS
up- or down-regulation have been published.28,29 One of the materials that only recently has been started to be exploited
for its dual ability to scavenge and to generate ROS according to
alterations to the pH of the extra- and intracellular microenvironment
is CeO2. CeO2 in the nanoscale range (e.g.,
nanoparticles) has the ability to scavenge ROS when the environmental
pH is 7.4, yet generates reactive oxygen species when the pH is 6,
a value close to the
one that cancerous tissues present. This ability makes CeO2 nanoparticles attractive since they can work as a natural bodyguard
for healthy cells while selectively killing cancerous cells. On the
basis of this, a number of studies that make use of CeO2 nanoparticles alone or in combination with other types of treatments
have been presented.30,31

In the scope of this, we
hypothesized that the combination of CeO2 nanoparticles
and doxorubicin will reduce the toxicity of
DOX towards healthy cells and will selectively kill cancer cells at
lower pH values. We further hypothesized that the encapsulation of
these nanoparticles inside a more stable delivery system that is not
affected by the ionic strength of the microenvironment will increase its stability
and release properties, allowing for an enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
Thus herein, we present the development of pH-sensitive CaCO3-based therapeutic modulators (C-TherMods) with enhanced anticancer
properties for the potential treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. These
microparticles, which are of spherical morphology, are composed of
a calcium carbonate core and a thin layer of collagen type I, which
acts as a barrier to the burst release of DOX through the C-TherMods.
The C-TherMods which are loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles
(<25 nm) and with the anticancer drug DOX, aim at a reduction
of the cytotoxicity on healthy heart cells (H9C2) and at an enhanced
anticancer activity against osteosarcoma cells (SAOS-2) due to increased
ROS generation at pH 6. The fabricated system was fully characterized
morphologically and physicochemically, and loading and release studies
were performed using high pressure liquid chromatography. The
in vitro studies demonstrated that the combination of CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX leads to an enhanced reduction in the proliferation
of osteosarcoma (SAOS-2) cells, while at the same time protects against
the toxicity toward heart cells (H9C2). The novelty of this study
lies in the enhanced therapeutic activity of the C-TherMods due to
the combinational treatment that it provides. Although other studies
that make use of CeO2 nanoparticles and/or DOX have been
published, this is the first time that a system loaded with a therapeutic
combination like the
one described above is
used, and that a simultaneous ability of inducing or inhibiting apoptosis/necrosis
due to CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX is presented.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All of the materials were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise.

Preparation of CaCO3 Therapeutic Modulators (C-TherMods)
The calcium
carbonate therapeutic modulators (C-TherMods) were
fabricated using a simple co-precipitation method. In the first step,
both CaCl2·2H2O (CAS: 10035-04-8) and Na2CO3 (CAS: 497-19-8) were dissolved in 400 and 300
μL of distilled water, respectively, while 10 mg of CeO2 nanoparticles (<25 nm) (CAS: 1306-38-3) were dispersed
in 100 μL of a doxorubicin (CAS: 25316-40-9) solution (10 mg/mL)
in water. The dispersion of CeO2 nanoparticles and doxorubicin
were added to the Na2CO3 solution and vortexed
for 30 s. The new dispersion (Na2CO3 + CeO2 nanoparticles + doxorubicin) was added to the CaCl2 solution under vigorous stirring (1500 rpm) and stirred for 30 s.
Then, the dispersion was left to precipitate for 15 min and subsequently
was washed three times with distilled water. The therapeutic microparticles
were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 s.

The coating
of the microparticles was performed at a second step. After cleaning,
a small amount of the microparticles’ dispersion was placed
in a preweighted vial and freeze-dried to calculate the concentration
of the dispersion. Then, the loaded microparticles were placed on
a magnetic stirrer under normal stirring at pH 5.5, and collagen type
I at the same pH and at a final concentration of 1.9 mg/mL was added
to the dispersion. The new dispersion was stirred for 1 h and then
the therapeutic modulators were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 s and
washed three times with distilled water. Then, the sample was freeze-dried
and kept at 4 °C until further use.

Morphological and Physicochemical
Characterization
Electron Microscopy and Elemental Analysis
The morphological
characterization of the spherical microparticles was performed using
a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope.

For the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, a FEI 200
operating at 15 keV, with beam currents varying from 43 pA to 0.17
nA, was used. The elemental analysis was performed using a built-in
electron dispersion X-ray analysis detector from Bruker. All of the
samples were coated with gold at 25 mA for 90 s before their study
by SEM.

For the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis,
a FEI
Tecnai G2 F20 TWIN TMP with a Schottky emitter operated at 200 kV
was used. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses
have been acquired using a Bruker XFlash 6|T30 silicon drift detector,
with 30 mm2 effective area. Each sample has been sonicated
for a few minutes to avoid the presence of aggregates. The solution
(5 μL) has been dropped onto an ultrathin carbon-coated Cu grid
with a sample holder and a double-tilt analytical holder.

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
Dynamic light scattering
measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 of Malvern
Instruments. The measurements before and after the collagen coating
were carried out at 25 and 37 °C, and the conductivity was adjusted
in the range of 30–100 μS/cm using ultrapure water at
a pH 5.5, to have comparable results.

The ζ potential
values represent mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three
different measurements and with 17 runs in each measurement. Before
each acquisition, the samples were sonicated for ∼10 s using
a Bandelin ultrasonic probe at 8 W to avoid the presence of aggregates.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
Infrared
spectroscopy was performed using a Shimadzu Miracle 10. Before the
measurements, all of the samples have been freeze-dried. The number
of scans was set to 45, the scanning range was set from 4000 to 400
cm–1, and the resolution step was 4 cm–1. The graphs were plotted using OriginPro software 9.1.

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
XPS
measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer
using a monochromatized Al Kα source operating at 15 kV and
20 mA. Wide scans were acquired at an analyzer pass energy of 160
eV, while high-resolution narrow scans were performed at a constant
pass energy of 10 eV and steps of 0.1 eV. The photoelectrons were
detected at a takeoff angle Φ = 0° with respect to the
surface normal. The pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained
below 7 × 10–9 Torr for data acquisition. The
data were converted to VAMAS format and processed using CasaXPS software,
version 2.3.17. Data analysis on the Ce 3d energy region was performed
to assess Ce(III) and Ce(IV) contents, following the method described
in a previous study of our group.32

Inductively
Coupled Plasma (ICP) Analysis
Inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) was performed
using an iCAP 6500 Thermo spectrometer. All chemical analyses performed
by ICP-AES were affected by a systematic error of about 5%. Samples
were dissolved in HCl/HNO3 3:1 (v/v).

Loading and
Release Studies
The loading and release
studies were performed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph
(HPLC) Shimadzu LC-20AT. The chromatographic separation was carried
out using a C-18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle
size). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (containing
acetic acid 1%) and pumped in dynamic mode (gradient: ACN 15%-5 min,
25%-10 min, 50%-15 min, 75%-20 min) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
The elution of the analyte was monitored at 480 nm. The standard curve
was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of DOX in 1 mL of the mobile phase
and filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter. A concentration
range of 10–1000 μg/mL was obtained upon further serial
dilution.

Antioxidant Capacity
The antioxidant
ability of the
final system (C-TherMods) was assessed using a total antioxidant capacity
kit from Sigma-Aldrich according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Various concentrations of C-TherMods (50, 125, and 250 μg/mL)
were tested, and the results were compared to the antioxidant capacity
of Trolox, an analog of vitamin E.

In Vitro Studies
Cell Lines
In this study, two different cell lines
were used, the osteogenic sarcoma cell line SAOS-2 (ATCC HTB-85) and
the rat myoblastic cell line H9C2 (ATCC CRL-1446). Both cell lines
were cultured in T75 flasks using high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine, and at normal
culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). For all of the
experiments, the used cells were between passage 10 and passage 20.
The medium during culture was changed every 2 days.

Metabolic
Activity and Proliferation Assays
Upon 80%
of confluence in a T75 flask, both cell lines were detached using
trypsin 0.25% and seeded at a density of 25 × 103 cells/cm2 in a 24-well tissue culture plate, with 500 μL of the
same medium used for the culturing. After 48 h, the cells were treated
with various concentrations of free doxorubicin (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0,
and 6.0 μg/mL), free CeO2 nanoparticles (12.5, 25,
and 50 μg/mL), a combination of CeO2 nanoparticles
(50 μg/mL) and of the aforementioned doxorubicin concentrations,
and with C-TherMods (50, 125, and 250 μg/mL). For H9C2, the
pH of the used medium for all of the treatments was 7.4, while for
SAOS-2, two different media, one at pH 7.4 and one at pH 6.0, were
used. To assess the effect of each treatment on the cell metabolic
activity and proliferation, a WST-1 assay (Sigma-Aldrich) and a Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) were used, respectively, according
to the manufacturers’ instructions. For the PicoGreen Assay
Kit, 200 μL of Milli-Q ultrapure water was added to the cells,
followed by scraping. The cell dispersion was frozen at −80
°C, and after three freeze–thaw cycles, a predetermined
amount of the dispersion was used for DNA quantification. Sample fluorescence
was measured using a PerkinElmer (Victor 2030) plate reader at λex = 480 nm and λem = 520 nm.

Internalization
Studies
To evaluate C-TherMods internalization,
H9C2 and SAOS-2 cells were seeded on Ibidi 35 mm cell imaging Petri
dishes and preincubated for 24 h with 100 μg/mL of particles
in full supplemented media. After 24 h, the cells were washed two
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and then fixed
for 20 min at 4 °C with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS). After the
fixation, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature
with a blocking solution of goat serum (10% in PBS) and then stained
for 30 min at 37 °C with a mixture of Oregon Green 488 Phalloidin
0.165 μM (Thermo Fisher) and Hoechst solution 5 μg/mL
(Invitrogen). After staining, the cells were washed two times with
PBS. The internalization of C-TherMods by cells was studied using
confocal laser scanning microscopy on a Nikon C2+ system
(actin filament in green λex = 488 nm, λem = 525 nm; C-TherMods in red λex = 561 nm,
λem = 585 nm; nuclei in blue λex = 401 nm, λem = 447 nm). Three-dimensional (3D)
rendering of z-stacks was performed by using NIS-Elements
software (Nikon).

Assessment of Apoptosis/Necrosis
At predetermined time
points (24, 72, and 120 h post-treatment), H9C2 and SAOS-2 (at pH
7.4 and 6.0) were trypsinized and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) (Thermo Fisher) for viability,
apoptosis, and cell death assessment by flow cytometry. Briefly, at
each time point, cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered
saline solution without calcium and magnesium and detached using trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(0.05%). A total of 100 × 103 cells per tube were
stained with 2.5 μM annexin V-FITC and 1 μg/mL PI in annexin
V binding buffer (1×) for 15 min at 37 °C protected from
light. Cells stained with annexin V-FITC/PI were evaluated using a
Beckman Coulter cytoflex. Live cells (annexin V–/PI−),
apoptotic cells (annexin V+/PI−), and dead cells (PI+) were
analyzed using Cytoflex software (Beckman Coulter). Untreated cells
were used as controls.

Results and Discussion
Morphological
Characterization and Elemental Analysis
Calcium carbonate
microspheres have been robustly used as antioxidant
and/or as anticancer drug-delivery systems due to many advantages,
including easy fabrication and pH-sensitive properties. However, although
many studies related to CaCO3-delivery systems loaded with
antioxidant or anticancer drugs have been presented to date,13,17,33 there has not been a study demonstrating
that a calcium carbonate-based system can act as a modulator of oxidative
stress and subsequently as a therapeutic modulator, by protecting
healthy cells and killing cancer cells depending on the pH of the
extracellular environment. In this study, we tried to combine the
advantages of a calcium carbonate-delivery system with versatile CeO2 nanoparticles, which can act as a pro-oxidant or as an antioxidant
agent depending on the extracellular pH, and we also enhanced the
therapeutic efficacy of our carrier toward osteosarcoma cells, by
loading this carrier with the anticancer drug doxorubicin. In the
final step, we coated the fabricated system with collagen aiming at
attaching to the system a biomimetic character that mimics the bone
environment.

After the synthesis, the first study that we performed
was the morphological assessment of the calcium carbonate microparticles
loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles and doxorubicin and coated
with collagen type I (hereafterin called C-TherMods), and this was
carried out using transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques.
From the TEM and SEM images (Figures 1 and S1A in the Supporting
Information), it can be seen that the microparticles consist of smaller
particles creating a larger structure with a rough surface and an
average size of 0.75 ± 0.25 μm (mean value of 100 particles).
From the transmission electron micrograph, the presence of CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface of C-TherMods is evident, and
according to the XPS analysis presented in Figure S1B, the percentage of cerium (Ce) on the surface of the microparticles
is 4.81% (other elements: C 47.44%, O 39.94%, Ca 7.17%, Na 0.64%).
ICP analysis showed that the total percentage of Ce in the whole structure
of C-TherMods is 17.70% (Ca: 36.80%). Mapping of the elements by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Figures 1 and S1A) and the EDS images
presented in Figure S1C prove the homogeneous
deposition of CeO2 nanoparticles on the whole surface of
the microparticles.

mapping of the elements that comprise C-TherMods (top right: Ca; bottom
left: Ce; bottom right: O). The scale bar is 200 nm.

Physicochemical Characterization
To prove the successful
coating with collagen as well as to further confirm the presence of
CeO2 nanoparticles, we performed dynamic light scattering
measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

The
ζ potential measurements demonstrated a negative surface charge
(ζ) of the microparticles (−20.90 ± 2.12 mV) before
collagen coating, while after the coating, a shift toward positive
values (+11.80 ± 5.91 mV) was observed, suggesting that collagen
was successfully deposited on the surface of the CaCO3 microparticles.
This positive surface charge can be attributed to the amine and carboxylic
groups of collagen, which at a slightly acidic pH (5.5) are protonated
giving a positive ζ potential. The data presented in Figure 2A represent the average
of three measurements at 25 °C, but similar results were also
acquired when the temperature was increased at 37 °C.

Figure 2 (A) ζ
potential measurements of plain CaCO3 microparticles
(ζ = −20.90 ± 2.12 mV, cond. = 36.7 μS/cm)
and C-TherMods (ζ = +11.80 ± 5.91 mV, cond. = 67.3 μS/cm)
and (B) FT-IR spectra of plain CaCO3 (spectrum a), CaCO3 loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles (spectrum b), free
CeO2 nanoparticles (spectrum c), and C-TherMods (spectrum
d).

Due to the fact that the CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface
of the microparticle may also affect the surface charge of the C-TherMods,
we also performed infrared spectroscopy as a complementary technique
to verify the presence of collagen. The data illustrated in Figure 2B present the spectra
of (a) plain calcium carbonate microparticles (CaCO3),
(b) calcium carbonate microparticles loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles
(CaCO3 + CeO2), (c) commercial CeO2 nanoparticles, and (d) collagen-coated calcium carbonate microparticles
loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX (C-TherMods). The
strong broad peak at 1400 cm–1 in spectra (a), (b),
and (d) corresponds to the v3 asymmetric vibration of CO3.34 The peak at 1648 cm–1 in spectrum (d) can be attributed to the amide I (N–H) bond
of collagen, while the peak at 1077 cm–1 corresponds
to ν(C–O) and ν(C–O–C) absorptions
of the carbohydrate moieties.35 The peaks
of CeO2 in spectrum (c) (ca. 555 cm–1, magnified spectrum) cannot be seen in spectrum (d) due to the weak
signal that CeO2 provides and due to the fact that these
vibrations are covered by the strong vibrations of calcium carbonate
at 1400 cm–1. A magnified image of the peaks of
CeO2 (spectrum c) is also given in the inlet of Figure 2B, aiming at making
more clear the presence of CeO2 nanoparticles on C-TherMods.

The antioxidant ability of C-TherMods was finally studied and it
was found that 50, 125, and 250 μg/mL of C-TherMods are equivalent
with 20.0, 42.5, and 47.5 nmol of Trolox, respectively, proving their
ability to scavenge ROS.

Loading and Release Studies
The
dynamic loading, the
encapsulation efficiency, and the release profiles of DOX encapsulated
in C-TherMods at three different pH values (7.4, 6.0, and 4.5) were
assessed by HPLC. From these studies, it was found that the encapsulation
efficiency of C-TherMods is 88.40 ± 3.80%, while the dynamic
loading was 2.56 ± 0.50%. The encapsulation efficiency values
are close to other similar systems reported in the literature, where
DOX is encapsulated inside calcium carbonate microparticles without
any coating36 or with a biomimetic coating,37,38 as well as in systems where DOX is conjugated with CeO2 nanoparticles.39

The release profile
of DOX that is presented in Figure 3, demonstrates a controlled and sustained release over
time, which depends on pH. At pH 7.4, the cumulative release of DOX
reaches up to 18% after a period of 8 days, while this percentage
is increased (35%) when the pH is reduced to 6.0 and further increases
to 63% when the pH is further reduced to 4.5. It has to be noted that
compared to other systems in the literature,37 C-TherMods do not present a burst release in the first few hours
inside the medium. This behavior may be attributed not only to the
collagen layer around C-TherMods that is partially responsible for
the slow release of DOX, but also due to potential electrostatic interactions
between CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX that further enhance
this sustained release. It is also noteworthy that compared to other
similar works in the literature, the release of DOX is slow and sustained
when pH is 7.4, while it has a dramatic release when pH is 4.5. For
example, Kamba et al. presented an 80% release of DOX at pH 7.4 after
20 h,36 while Bosio et al.38 and Dong et al.37 presented
at pH 7.4 a 50 and an 18% release after 24 h, respectively. During
the release of DOX at lower pH, although the results demonstrated
that the release behavior is similar to other systems, our system
demonstrated a more controlled release depending on the pH, suggesting
its appropriateness for controlled and sustained drug delivery.

Figure 3 DOX release
profiles from of C-TherMods acquired through HPLC at
different time points (1, 4, 24, 72, 120, and 192 h) and at different
pH values (4.5, 6.0, and 7.4) at 37 °C (data are presented as
mean ± SD).

When the pH is acidic,
three parameters affect the release of DOX
from the C-TherMods. The first one is the electrostatic interactions
between amine and carboxylic groups of collagen, which start to protonate
due to the low pH, leading to repulsion between the functional groups
and potentially create some free space that allows the drug to be
released. Secondly, the degradation of CaCO3 at low pH
also affects the release profile, while thirdly, as aforementioned,
an increased release can also be potentially attributed to the alterations
of the electrostatic interactions between CeO2 nanoparticles
and DOX.

Internalization Studies
Confocal microscopy was used
to assess the ability of SAOS-2 and H9C2 to internalize the C-TherMods.
The confocal images presented in Figure 4 prove that C-TherMods can be internalized
from both cell lines after a period of 24 h. Complementary results
from confocal microscopy can also be found in the Supporting Information
(Figure S2).

Effect of Doxorubicin, CeO2 Nanoparticles, and C-TherMods
on Cell Proliferation
C-TherMods represent a stimuli-responsive
and versatile system, the therapeutic ability of which depends on
various constituents and conditions. In view of this, we assessed
the effect of these various constituents on cell metabolic activity
(Figure S3 in the Supporting Information)
and proliferation (Figure 5) independently, aiming at understanding how our system works.
SAOS-2 was selected as an in vitro model for osteogenic sarcoma, and
two different pH values were used, aimed at imitating the extra/intracellular
pH of the environment of the tumor tissue. In addition, since the
use of doxorubicin has been related to several side effects including
a significant increase in heart failure depending on the administered
dose, we used H9C2 as an in vitro model for studying the effect of
C-TherMods on cardiac tissue. The results that are presented below
as well as in the Supporting Information demonstrate that C-TherMods are not only able to kill cancer cells,
but also in tandem protect H9C2 cells from the toxicity of doxorubicin.

concentrations of C-TherMods (A–C), CeO2 nanoparticles
(D–F), DOX (G–I), and a combination of CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX (J–L) at different time points and
at different pH values. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
analysis of variance, *n = 3, p <
0.05.

It is evident from the graphs
in Figure 5A–C
that C-TherMods demonstrate a
protective effect toward H9C2 in comparison to SAOS-2 (pHs 7.4 and
6.0) even at the lowest concentration for the first 24 h. The same
protective effect can also be seen for the time points of 72 and 120
h (Figure 5A), although
significantly different compared to the 24 h time point. The proliferation
rate of H9C2 cells is reduced probably due to the release of doxorubicin
that affects also the metabolic activity of H9C2. The proliferation
rate of SAOS-2 at 72 h at both pH values (Figure 5B,C) is higher than the proliferation rate
of H9C2, and this can be attributed to the fact that SAOS-2 are proliferating
with a higher rate giving a higher proliferation compared to H9C2.
This peculiarity can be seen only at the concentrations of 50 and
125 μg/mL of C-TherMods, probably due to the lower concentration
of the encapsulated doxorubicin, while at the concentration of 250
μg/mL, the proliferation rate is similar for all cell types
(Figure 5A–C,
250 μg/mL). At 120 h, it is more evident that C-TherMods at
concentrations of 125 and 250 μg/mL provide higher protection
to H9C2 (cell proliferation ∼65%) in comparison to SAOS-2 at
pH 7.4 (cell proliferation ∼50%) and to SAOS-2 at pH 6.0 (cell
proliferation ∼55%); for statistical significance, please see
the corresponding figures. The presented results are in close agreement
with the work of Zhao et al.,33 in which
a calcium carbonate/doxorubicin@silica nanoreactor was fabricated.
In this study, the pH-dependent release of DOX affected the proliferation
of HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in an
80% reduction in cell proliferation after 24 h when 5 μg/mL
of DOX was used and in a 40% reduction when DOX was encapsulated inside
the proposed nanoreactor. These results are similar to the
ones presented in this work, and more specifically with the results
presented in Figure 5B (24 h) for 250 μg/mL of C-TherMods (corresponding
to 6.4 μg/mL of free DOX) at pH 7.4, and with the results for
free DOX that are presented in Figure 5H (3 and 6 μg/mL).

CeO2 nanoparticles
are well known for their enzyme-like
activity, which allows them to act as a pro-oxidant (ROS generation)
or as an antioxidant (ROS scavenging) depending on the pH. Taking
into consideration this characteristic, and wanting to relate this
property to the ability of C-TherMods to protect H9C2 cells and kill
cancerous cells, we performed metabolic activity and DNA proliferation
assays using various concentrations of CeO2 nanoparticles.
From the graphs depicted in Figure 5D–F, as well as from the graphs of metabolic
activity (Figure S3D–F in the Supporting
Information), it can be seen that CeO2 nanoparticles do
not have an effect either on the metabolic activity or on the proliferation
of any of the treated cell lines. It was expected that CeO2 nanoparticles at pH 6.0 would generate more ROS leading to a ROS-mediated
apoptosis and to a reduction in the proliferation of SAOS-2, but as
presented in Figure 5F, this is not evident. Two possible reasons can be hypothesized
for the lack of any effect. The first reason is that CeO2 nanoparticles at pH 6.0 do not generate a high amount of ROS capable
of leading to ROS-mediated apoptosis, and the second one relies
on a possible ability of SAOS-2 to scavenge the overproduced ROS.
The high proliferation rate of SAOS-2 even at pH 6.0 leads to a high
metabolic activity (Figure S3F in the Supporting
Information) and an increased cell number, which can be responsible
not only for increased ROS production, but also for increased ROS
scavenging. Both the increased cell number due to high proliferation
and the increased ROS scavenging support our aforementioned hypothesis.

In contrast to CeO2 nanoparticles, doxorubicin presents
cytotoxicity even at the lowest used concentration of 500 ng/mL (Figures 5G–I and S3G–I in the Supporting Information).
According to the loading studies, the dynamic loading of doxorubicin
is 2.56%, meaning that 50, 125, and 250 μg/mL of C-TherMods
correspond to 1.28, 3.20, and 6.40 μg/mL of free doxorubicin.
Comparing the results between free doxorubicin (Figures 5G–I and S3G–I in the Supporting Information) and C-TherMods (Figures 5A–C and S3A–C in the Supporting Information),
it is pretty evident that C-TherMods provide protection toward H9C2
cells and a controlled cytotoxic effect over time toward SAOS-2 at
pH values of 7.4 and 6.0 and at concentrations of 125 and 250 μg/mL
(comparison between Figure 5A–C and 5G–I at 120 h
and corresponding figures for metabolic activity, Figure S3A–C and S3G–I; for statistical significance, please see the corresponding figures).

To enhance our hypothesis concerning the protective role of CeO2 nanoparticles inside C-TherMods, we have treated both SAOS-2
cells at pH values of 7.4 and 6.0 and H9C2 cells at pH 7.4 with C-TherMods
that do not contain CeO2 nanoparticles. Both the metabolic
activity and the proliferation assays that are presented in the Supporting
Information (Figure S4) show that even
at the lowest concentration of C-TherMods (50 μg/mL) after 24
h, the metabolic activity of H9C2 cells is reduced to 75% (Figure S4A), while the cell proliferation (Figure S4D) is reduced to 30%, in contrast to
C-TherMods that contain CeO2 nanoparticles where the corresponding
metabolic activity (Figure S3A) and the
cell proliferation (Figure 5A) are 100%. It has to be noted that this difference in both the metabolic
activity and cell proliferation can also be attributed to the different
release profiles of DOX. As it is aforementioned, the release of DOX
is also affected by the electrostatic interactions between CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX, resulting in different release profiles
in the presence or absence of CeO2 nanoparticles. In the
case of SAOS-2, a higher decrease in both metabolic activity (Figure S4B,C) and cell proliferation (Figure S4E,F) is observed after 24 h compared
to the group where cells were treated with C-TherMods containing CeO2 nanoparticles (Figures 5B,C and S3B,C). This behavior
can be attributed to the faster release of DOX from C-TherMods, since
as we mentioned before, the absence of CeO2 nanoparticles
possibly affects the release behavior. The protective role of CeO2 nanoparticles inside C-TherMods is mostly evident after 72
h, when the cell proliferation in H9C2 is increasing with the concentration
of C-TherMods if CeO2 nanoparticles are encapsulated (Figure 5A), while decreasing
with the increasing concentration of C-TherMods if CeO2 nanoparticles are not used (Figure S4E). After 72 h, both H9C2 and SAOS-2 cells are dead probably due to
the increased release of DOX.

Since CeO2 nanoparticles
did not present any cytotoxic
effect even at the highest concentration of 50 μg/mL, and since
doxorubicin presented a high cytotoxic effect even at the lowest concentration
of 500 ng/mL, we decided to assess the effect that the combination
of CeO2 nanoparticles and doxorubicin can have. The results
presented in Figures 5J–L and S3J–L demonstrate
that the combination of CeO2 nanoparticles and doxorubicin
can have a protective effect as well as a cytotoxic effect depending
on time and pH. In the case of H9C2 cells (Figure 5J), it is pretty evident that for the time
point of 24 h and for concentrations of doxorubicin up to 1.5 μg/mL,
CeO2 nanoparticles can protect H9C2 cells. This protective
effect can be attributed to the scavenging of overproduced ROS. Doxorubicin
mechanism of action relies on the intercalation and inhibition of
macromolecular anabolism, which stops the process of DNA replication.
Along with this inhibition, doxorubicin can lead to cell apoptosis
through ROS overproduction and a subsequent ROS-mediated apoptosis.
We hypothesize that the protective effect that can be seen when CeO2 nanoparticles and doxorubicin are combined is due to the
fact that CeO2 nanoparticles (ROS scavengers) counteract
doxorubicin cytotoxic effect by reducing the ROS-mediated apoptosis.
Although we cannot know the exact mechanism of action, the data presented
in Figure 5J–L
support our claims. At low doxorubicin concentrations, the protective
effect is more evident and mostly for the H9C2 cells. When the concentration
of doxorubicin is higher than 1.5 μg/mL, CeO2 nanoparticles
cannot protect H9C2 cells, thus leading to cell death (Figure 5J). The same protective effect
can be seen also after 72 and 120 h (Figure 5J) with respect to free doxorubicin (Figure 5G). Comparing these
data to the data about SAOS-2 at pH 7.4 (Figure 5K) and SAOS-2 at pH 6 (Figure 5L), we see that the protective effect of
CeO2 nanoparticles is not so evident in these cases. One
possible reason for this is the pH value of SAOS-2 cultures: in the
case of SAOS-2 at pH 6.0, we can assume that this slightly acidic
pH either increases the ability of CeO2 nanoparticles to
produce ROS or reduces their ability to scavenge ROS.

Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis
Studies
Flow cytometry
was used as a complementary technique to assess the ability of C-TherMods
to induce and/or to inhibit apoptosis. The results that are presented
in Figure 6 and in Figure S5/Table S1 in the Supporting Information are in agreement with the results
that were acquired using the dsDNA-based cell proliferation assay
kit and that were analyzed above.

Figure 6 Bar graphs presenting % of live (black),
necrotic (red), and apoptotic
(blue) cells in H9C2 (A–C) and SAOS-2 cultures at pH 7.4 (D–F)
and at pH 6.0 (G–I), after treatment with free DOX, a combination
of CeO2 nanoparticles + DOX, and C-TherMods for 24, 72,
and 120 h. The samples coded as CTRL refer to untreated samples at
24 h, correspondingly for each condition (H9C2 at pH 7.4, SAOS-2 at
pH 7.4, and SAOS-2 at pH 6.0).

For the H9C2 cell line, it can be seen that the use of free
DOX
even at the lowest concentration of 0.5 μg/mL for 24 h (Figure 6A) leads to the death
of H9C2 cells, with 65% of the cell population being necrotic and
7% being in the early apoptotic stage. As the concentration of DOX
increases, the number of dead cells also increases to 80 and 95% for
1.0 and 1.5 μg/mL, respectively. When DOX is combined with CeO2 nanoparticles at a concentration 50 μg/mL, it can be
seen that the percentages of dead (necrotic) cells at 24 h are
reduced to 49, 52, and 45%, for 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μg/mL, respectively,
while the percentage of early apoptotic cells remains in the range
of 7–10% (Figure 6A). This protective effect, as we pointed out in the previous paragraph,
can be attributed to the therapeutic effect of CeO2 nanoparticles.
This protective effect is much higher when C-TherMods are used, not
only due to the encapsulated CeO2 nanoparticles, but also
because of the slow release of doxorubicin, since at 24 h only
15% of DOX is released. Increased concentration of C-TherMods leads
to an increased number of live cells, with 72,
81, and 85% viability for concentrations of 50, 125, and 250
μg/mL, respectively (Figure 6A). For these C-TherMods concentrations, the necrotic
cells are, respectively, 13, 6, and 3%, while the early apoptotic
cells are 16, 13, and 12%. The reason why early apoptosis is more
evident in the cells treated with C-TherMods compared to free DOX
and to the combination of CeO2 nanoparticles and DOX, is
attributed to the lower concentration of DOX that is released from
the C-TherMods, allowing a better observation of apoptosis. After
72 h (Figure 6B), the
majority (∼90%) of H9C2 cells treated with free DOX are dead,
while a small percentage (∼23%) of the cells is alive when
CeO2 nanoparticles are used in combination with DOX. The
viability of the cells is significantly higher when C-TherMods are
used, presenting more than 50–60% viable H9C2 cells. After
120 h, the protective effect of C-TherMods is evident mostly at the
highest concentration (250 μg/mL) of C-TherMods, where the viable
cells remain at 65%, while for the lower concentrations the viability
ranges approximately to 35% (Figure 6B).

In Figure 6D–F,
results concerning SAOS-2 cells are different. When SAOS-2 cells are
treated with free DOX or with the combination of CeO2 nanoparticles
+ DOX, the majority of the cells is dead even at 24 h. When the SAOS-2
cells are treated with C-TherMods, the percentage of viable cells
remains at 80% when the lowest concentration of C-TherMods (50 μg/mL)
is used, ranges from 40 to 55% when 125 μg/mL is used, and reduces
from 80% (24 h) to 50% (120 h) when 250 μg/mL are used. These
results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of C-TherMods affects SAOS-2
cells in a dose-dependent manner, and also that this cytotoxicity
is related to the controlled release of DOX. In addition, the DOX-related
cytotoxicity can be counteracted by the protective ability of CeO2 nanoparticles at pH 7.4, where they act as an antioxidant
protecting the cells from ROS-mediated apoptosis. Finally, when the
pH of the media is reduced to 6.0 (Figure 6G–I), 100% of the cells die after
24 h even after treatment with the lowest concentration of free DOX,
CeO2 nanoparticles + DOX, and C-TherMods. In these conditions,
C-TherMods do not present any protective effect, and this could be attributed
to the fact that CeO2 nanoparticles start to act as pro-oxidants,
leading to increased ROS and enhancing the cytotoxic effect of the
fabricated system through a combinatory ROS-mediated and DOX-mediated
apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Das et al.,39 who present an enhanced antitumor effect against
three different ovarian cancer cell lines when CeO2 nanoparticles
and DOX are combined, as well as by the work of Alpaslan et al.,31 where it was demonstrated that a pH value around
6 enhances the cytotoxicity of CeO2 nanoparticles and subsequently
increases cell death in bone cancer cells, compared to physiological
(7.0) and basic (9.0) pH values. It has to be noted that pH 6.0 is
also affecting the viability of the cells, and this slightly acidic
pH contributes to the increased cytotoxicity.

Conclusions
Herein, pH-responsive microparticles loaded with the anticancer
drug doxorubicin and CeO2 nanoparticles, and coated with
collagen type I, were fabricated. These microparticles (C-TherMods)
were fully characterized morphologically and physicochemically using
several complementary material characterization techniques. The loading
ability and the release profile of C-TherMods were assessed at various
pH values, and it was found that C-TherMods can release DOX in a pH-dependent
manner and over a period of time of more than 8 days. The in vitro
studies using functional assays and the apoptosis/necrosis studies
using flow cytometry demonstrated that C-TherMods have a protective
effect toward the H9C2 heart myoblast cell line, and this protective
effect could be attributed to the slow pH-dependent release of DOX
as well as to the protective effect of CeO2 nanoparticles.
When C-TherMods were used to treat SAOS-2 at pH 7.4, it was found
that their cytotoxic effect was dose-dependent, and after 120 h, the
highest concentration of C-TherMods (250 μg/mL) led to a reduction
of viable cells from 80% (24 and 72 h) to 51% (120 h). The protective
effect of C-TherMods ceased to exist when the pH of the medium was
reduced to 6, suggesting that the encapsulated CeO2 nanoparticles
started acting as pro-oxidants, enhancing in this way the cytotoxic
effect of the C-TherMods by inducing cell death through a combination
of ROS-mediated and DOX-mediated apoptosis.

The above-presented
results suggest that the fabricated C-TherMods
can act as novel stimuli-responsive therapeutic modulators able to
protect specific cell lines (e.g., H9C2) and at the same time to kill
the cancerous ones (e.g., SAOS-2).
