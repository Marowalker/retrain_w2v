The C–H activation of methane
remains a longstanding challenge
in the chemical industry. Metal oxides are attractive catalysts for
the C–H activation of methane due to their surface Lewis acid–base
properties. In this work, we applied density functional theory calculations
to investigate the C–H activation mechanism of methane on various
sites of low-index facets of γ-Al2O3.
The feasibility of C–H activation on different metal–oxygen
(acid–base) site pairs was assessed through two potential mechanisms,
namely, the radical and polar. The effect of surface hydroxylation
on C–H activation was also investigated to examine the activity
of γ-Al2O3 under realistic catalytic surface
conditions (hydration). On the basis of our calculations, it was demonstrated
that the C–H activation barriers for polar pathways are significantly
lower than those of the radical pathways on γ-Al2O3. We showed that the electronic structure (s- and p-band
center) for unoccupied and occupied bands can be used to probe site-dependent
Lewis acidity and basicity and the associated catalytic behavior.
We identified the dissociated H2 binding and final state
energy as C–H activation energy descriptors for the preferred
polar pathway. Finally, we developed structure–activity relationships
for the C–H activation of methane on γ-Al2O3 that account for surface Lewis acid–base properties
and can be utilized to accelerate the discovery of catalysts for methane
(and shale gas) upgrade.

Introduction
The recent development
of hydraulic fracking technology and increasing
shale gas reserves make natural gas an attractive feedstock for the
synthesis of high-value chemicals.1−3 Direct combustion of
methane cannot utilize its full potential in the chemical industry.4 Owing to the low volumetric density of methane,
its transportation from rural-area shale reserves is expensive and
challenging. Therefore, there is significant demand to convert methane
to high-value and high-density chemicals. Currently, the transformation
of methane in industry is achieved via an indirect process of its
conversion to syn-gas (CO + H2) at elevated temperatures
(>970 K).5,6 However, this process is energetically
demanding
and cost-ineffective. Due to the high C–H bond strength of
methane, an industrially viable process for the efficient and selective
conversion of methane to higher value chemicals has yet to be realized.
Interestingly, the conversion of methane (e.g., to methanol) is thermodynamically
viable but kinetically challenging.1,7 Efficient and
selective catalysts are required to overcome this kinetic difficulty.
Metal oxides are known to catalyze reactions involving C–H
activation8,9 because of their surface Lewis acid (metal)
and base (oxygen) sites.8−15 Toward activating the C–H bond of methane, various metal
oxides have been widely explored using experimental8,9 and
computational9,16−24 methods. Interestingly, preheated γ-Al2O3 (at high temperature, >400 °C) is one of the most active
catalysts
for C–H activation of methane.25−27 Preheated γ-Al2O3 catalyzes the hydrogen–deuterium exchange
reaction of the mixture of D2/CH4 and CH4/CD4 at room temperature with very low activation
barriers.25−27 It has been demonstrated that the thermal pretreatment
of γ-Al2O3 generates high-energy surfaces,
which are primarily responsible for the activity of γ-Al2O3 toward hydrogen–deuterium exchange.28,29 Recently, it was shown that preheated γ-Al2O3 (at 500 °C) shows exceptional activity for alkane C–H
activation and dehydrogenation.30 It is
believed that the high-temperature pretreatment exposes under-coordinated
surface acid–base site pairs.30−33 Valla et al. have demonstrated
that the tricoordinated Al sites are generated by high-temperature
pretreatment of γ-Al2O3.34 Sautet and co-workers computationally studied the C–H
activation of methane and propane on γ-Al2O3 (110) on several catalytic sites (e.g AlIII–OII and AlIII–OIII) through the
polar pathway.31,32,35,36 The authors also investigated the effect
of surface hydration on methane activation on these sites. C–H
activation of methane can potentially occur through the polar16−18 or radical mechanism.22,37−39 In the polar mechanism, a C–H bond of methane breaks heterolytically
to form surface-bound hydroxyl and methyl-aluminum species. The radical
mechanism evolves through the homolytic C–H bond cleavage with
the formation of radical intermediates. In this mechanism, the hydrogen
radical reacts with surface oxygen to form surface hydroxyl and releases
the methyl radical in the gas phase. It has been suggested that the
radical pathway is usually favored in oxidative C–H activation
through oxygen-centered radicals or on doped metal oxides.39,40 However, the feasibility of radical pathway has not been assessed
on γ-Al2O3 yet.

Due to the high
surface heterogeneity of oxides (existence of various
sites with variable Lewis acidity and basicity), the identification
of structure–activity relationships (relationships between
the catalyst properties and reaction activity) is highly desirable.
These relationships offer a rational understanding of catalytic activity
and a predictive tool for discovering and designing active catalysts.41−43 Toward the identification of structure–activity relationships,
Latimer et al. recently established the adsorption energy of atomic
hydrogen as universal oxidative C–H activation descriptor through
the radical pathway.19 Recently, Jiang
et al. investigated C–H activation of methane on oxygen atoms,
which were preadsorbed on Co3O4 and identified
the Adjusted Coordination Number (based on generalized coordination
number and Bader charges) as a descriptor for the C–H activation
barrier.23 Janik and co-workers revealed
a correlation between the C–H bond activation energy and the
surface reducibility.21 As a result, significant
research has been focused on oxidative C–H activation of methane
on single (oxygen) site over the last few decades, but the nonoxidative
C–H activation of methane on oxides (on acid–base pair
sites) remains underexplored. In addition, there is no systematic
approach to screen oxide catalysts toward a catalytic reaction. The
key hurdle, which possibly hinders the development of structure–activity
relationships for nonoxidative C–H activation, is the existence
of a large number of inequivalent sites with variable Lewis acidity/basicity
(high surface heterogeneity) on the oxides.44 In the nonoxidative C–H activation, both Lewis acid and base
sites are involved in the reaction at the same time, and probing these
properties on oxide surfaces with variable coordination environments
(affecting Lewis acidity and basicity) becomes significantly complex.45 In our recent work, we developed structure–activity
relationships for propane dehydrogenation on γ-Al2O3 that unraveled the dependence of the propane dehydrogenation
activity on the strength of surface acid–base site pairs. Moreover,
we observed a site-dependent catalytic behavior of γ-Al2O3 and revealed a volcano relationship between
activity and dissociated H2 binding energy (BE) on the
respective site pairs.46

In this
work, we focus on methane activation on γ-Al2O3 because of its high degree of surface heterogeneity45,47,48 and high catalytic activity.
These properties make γ-Al2O3 an excellent
candidate to identify structure–activity relationships for
nonoxidative C–H activation. Specifically, we applied first-principles
calculations to identify the preferred mechanism of C–H activation
on different low-index surface facets of γ-Al2O3, by also accounting surface hydration. Our work revealed
structure–activity relationships for C–H activation
of methane, which can be used for screening different metal oxides
and aid in accelerated catalyst discovery.

Results and Discussion
We employed the nonspinel model of alumina, as developed by Sautet
and co-workers.47,48Figure 1 shows the unit cell of γ-Al2O3 and different surface terminations (surface cleaving).

(100) (blue), (c) (110) (green), and (d) (111) (brown) termination
planes.

To examine the influence of Lewis
acidity and basicity on the C–H
activation barriers, we investigated the polar mechanisms on three
low-index surface facets of γ-Al2O3: (100),
(110), and (111), as shown in Figure 2.47,48 These surface facets of γ-Al2O3 were optimized, and it was noticed that Al atoms
display pentacoordination (AlV) on (100) facet, tetra-
(AlIV) and tricoordinations (AlIII) on (110)
facet, and tricoordination (AlIII) on (111) facet. Oxygen
atoms were found to display tricoordination (OIII) on γ-Al2O3 (100) facet, di- (OII) and tricoordinations
(OIII) on (110) facet, and tri- (OIII) and tetracoordinations
(OIV) on (111) facet.47,48 We choose
different distinctive acid–base site pairs (based on the coordination
numbers) on each surface facet (Figure 2). Specifically, the selected site pairs are: on γ-Al2O3 (100) facet, AlVa–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIb, AlVa–OIIIc, on γ-Al2O3 (110) facet, AlIII–OII, AlIII–OIII, AlIVa–OII, AlIVa–OIII and AlIVb–OII, and on γ-Al2O3 (111) facet, AlIIIa–OIVa, AlIIIa–OIVb, AlIIIb–OIIIa and AlIIIb–OIIIb.

metal–oxygen site pairs on γ-Al2O3 (a) (100), (b) (110), and (c) (111) surface
facets.

The electronic structure of the
catalyst plays an important role
on the overall catalytic activity.49,50 To understand
the Lewis acidity and basicity of different sites of γ-Al2O3, we investigated the projected density of states
of the (100), (110), and (111) facets of γ-Al2O3. For molecular systems, the locations of the highest occupied
molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, are related
with the Lewis acidity (electrophilicity) and basicity (nucleophilicity)
of these systems, as these orbitals are involved in electron loss
and gain processes, respectively.51 By
analogy, for periodic surfaces, the Lewis acidity and basicity can
be probed by identifying the location of the centers of unoccupied
and occupied bands, respectively. Toward assessing the Lewis acidity
and basicity of different site pairs, we calculated the projected
density of states Al(s) and O(p) orbitals of γ-Al2O3 (100), (110), and (111) facets (Figure 3). It is clear from Figure 3 that low-lying unoccupied bands of aluminum
atoms are Al(s) bands, and high-lying occupied bands of oxygen atoms
are O(p) bands. Therefore, we computed the unoccupied s-band center
(εsAl)
for Al atoms and occupied p-band center (εpO) of O atoms. On the (100) facet,
based on the unoccupied s-band center the Lewis acidity of aluminum
atoms follows the trend (lower εs = more acidic):
AlVa (εs = 6.19) > AlVb (εs = 6.6) > AlVc (εs = 7.71).
This
trend is in agreement with previous calculations by Jenness et al.52 The calculated occupied p-band center suggests
that the Lewis basicity of oxygen atoms on the (100) facet follows
the trend: OIIIa (εp = −3.78) ≈
OIIIc (εp = −3.89) > OIIIb (εp = −4.13). On the (110) facet, the strongest
Lewis acid site is AlIII (εs = 5.81) followed
by AlIVb (εs = 5.87) site, and the weakest
Lewis acid site is AlIVa (εs = 6.11).
The basicity of oxygen atoms bound with AlIVa follows the
order of OII (εp = −2.87) >
OIII (εp = −3.53). On the (111)
facet,
the strongest Lewis acid site is AlIIIa (εs = 4.03) followed by AlIIIb (εs = 6.09).

(100), (middle panel) (110), and (bottom panel) (111) facet of γ-Al2O3. Locations of s- and p-band centers are shown
with vertical lines. The calculated values of s- and p-band centers
are given in Table S1. Fermi level was
shifted to zero.

After assessing the site-dependent
Lewis acidity and basicity,
we turn our attention to the C–H activation mechanisms of methane.
In general, there are two potential surface mechanisms that exist
for C–H activation of methane on oxide catalysts, the polar
and radical pathways.16−18,37 The former mechanism
is characterized by polar (heterolytic) dissociation of C–H
bond of methane, whereas the latter is characterized by homolytic
dissociation of the C–H bond of methane. The polar mechanism
(Figure 4, top panel)
involves the C–H bond breaking of methane in heterolytic fashion
on the surface to yield CH3–* and surface-adsorbed H+*. In the radical mechanism (Figure 4, bottom panel), the C–H bond breaks by the
abstraction of a hydrogen radical by a surface oxygen atom while leaving
a methyl radical in the gas phase. To investigate the effects of Lewis
acidity and basicity on C–H activation of methane, we examined
both mechanisms on two stable facets ((100) and (110)) of γ-Al2O3. Additionally, the polar mechanism was also
investigated on the (111) facet of Al2O3. Figure 4 illustrates the
relevant stationary points in both pathways, radical and polar on
the AlVa–OIIIa site pair.

Figure 4 Polar and radical mechanisms
of C–H activation of methane
on γ-Al2O3 (100) on the AlVa–OIIIa site pair. Transition states are denoted
with double daggers (‡). The top panel illustrates the polar
mechanism, whereas the bottom, the radical.

Initially, we investigated the polar mechanism on the four
acid–base
site pairs (AlVa–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIb, AlVa–OIIIc, and AlVb–OIIIa) of (100) facet (Figure 2a), the five site
pairs (AlIII–OII, AlIVa–OII, AlIVa–OIII, AlIVb–OII, and AlIII–OIII) of the (110) facet (Figure 2b), and the four site pairs (AlIIIa–OIVa, AlIIIa–OIVb, AlIIIb–OIIIa, and AlIIIb–OIIIb) of the (111) facet (Figure 2c). We noticed that adsorption of methane is weakly exothermic
on the (100) and (110) facets, and it becomes stronger on the (111)
facet due to low average surface coordination numbers of Al and oxygen
atoms on this facet. For the polar mechanism on the (100) facet (Figure 5a), the lowest C–H
activation barrier was obtained on the site pair with strongest Lewis
acidity and basicity (AlVa–OIIIa, 94.5
kJ/mol) followed by the site pair involving the strongest acidic site
(AlVa–OIIIc, 115 kJ/mol). The barriers
on AlVb–OIIIb (174.2 kJ/mol) and AlVb–OIIIa (141.6) sites pairs are found relatively
higher due to lower acidity/basicity of corresponding acid–base
pairs. On the (110) facet (Figure 5b), low C–H activation barriers (84–91
kJ/mol) were obtained on the site pairs with strong Lewis acidity
and basicity (AlIII–OII and AlIVb–OII). However, the C–H activation was highly
exothermic on the AlIII–OII site pair,
demonstrating the strong Lewis acidity and basicity of corresponding
atoms of the site pairs. On this facet, the highest activation barrier
was noted for site pair with high surface coordination numbers (AlIVa–OIII, 126.8 kJ/mol). On the (111) facet
(Figure 5c), lowest
C–H activation barriers (64.4 and 66.6 kJ/mol) were noted for
the AlIIIa–OIVa and AlIIIa–OIVb site pairs. The activity behavior on these
site pairs might appear counter intuitive (due to high coordination
number of oxygen), however, due to the involvement of strongest Lewis
acidic (εs = 4.03) site, these site pairs display
low C–H activation barriers.

on γ-Al2O3 (a) (100), (b) (110), and (c)
(111) facets via
the polar pathway. The respective site pairs are shown in Figure 2.

Next, we investigated the radical mechanism on
the two most stable
facets of γ-Al2O3, the (100) and (110).
The (111) facet was not considered for the radical pathway as this
(nonhydrated) facet is higher in energy, and it has been experimentally
demonstrated that the (111) facet is present in low content on γ-Al2O3 particles.53,54 Specifically,
we investigated the radical mechanism on two oxygen sites (OIIIa and OIIIb) of (100) facet and three oxygen sites OIIa (OII site of AlIII–OII site pair), OIIIa (OIII site of AlIVa–OIII site pair), OIIb (OII site of AlIVb–OII site pair) on the
(110) facet.

To investigate the radical pathways, we started
with closed shell
(singlet) calculations on (100) facet. All attempts to find the transition
state with singlet calculations failed. In these calculations, the
guess geometry for the final state converges to the initial states.
Furthermore, the potential energy scan along the C–H bond coordinate
also indicated a highly endothermic (uphill) path (Figure S2). Subsequently, we investigated the radical pathway
with triplet states and successfully identified potential transition
states. However, the triplet reactant states for adsorbed methane
were found to be significantly higher in energy compared to corresponding
singlet states (Figure 6). The C–H activation barriers for radical pathway were found
to be highly endothermic for both the (100) and (110) facets investigated
in this work. We note that the C–H barriers via radical pathways
on the (110) facet are lower than that of the (100) facet.

activation energy profiles on γ-Al2O3 (a)
(100) and (b) (110) facets via the radical
pathway. The OIIa site corresponds to the OII site of the AlIII–OII site pair, the
OIIb site corresponds to the OII site of the
AlIVb–OII site pair, and the OIIIa site on 110 facet corresponds to the OIII site of the
AlIVa–OIII site pair. The respective
sites are shown in Figure 2.

As already discussed, we observed
significantly dissimilar C–H
activation barriers on site pairs with different Lewis acidities and
basicities (surface coordination) on the various surface facets of
γ-Al2O3. To further probe the Lewis acidity
and basicity, we calculated the binding energies of dissociated H2 (BE-H2) on all of the different site pairs of
(100), (110), and (111) facets. The choice of BE-H2 as
a Lewis acidity/basicity descriptor is based on the fact that the
adsorptions of hydride and proton (on the corresponding metal and
oxygen sites) resulting from the dissociated hydrogen (H2 → H+ + H–) act as an effective
probe for both electron-rich (oxygen) and electron-deficient (aluminum)
atoms. Additionally, in our recent work, we identified the binding
energy of dissociated H2 as an activity descriptor for
nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation on γ-Al2O3.55 By plotting the BE-H2 against the respective activation barriers for the most preferred,
i.e., polar mechanism (Figure 7a), we verify that it is a good descriptor of methane C–H
activation energy. In addition, a well-known descriptor for C–H
activation is the final state energy, EFS(20,56,57) (difference in energy
between the physisorbed and final (activated) states of methane on
the catalyst surface). This descriptor is based on BEP-type relationships58−60 (due to the late transition state of C–H activation). We
plotted the final state energy vs the activation energy of C–H
activation of methane through the polar pathway, and we noted a good
correlation as well (Figure 7b). Taken together, these suggest that the binding energy
of hydrogen and the final state energy can be used as interchangeable
descriptors for the C–H activation of methane. The identified
descriptors (Figure 7) relate the catalyst activity with reactant–catalyst physicochemical
properties and thus can be used for the construction of structure–activity
relationships. Interestingly, by plotting the dissociated H2 binding energies on different site pairs of (100) and (111) facets
vs the difference between occupied s-band center of Al and occupied
p-band center of O, we revealed a good correlation (Figure S3). This finding demonstrates a quantitative relationship
between band centers and Lewis acidity and basicity.

energy with respect to adsorbed
state of methane, on the corresponding acid–base sites. Orange
points represent sites on (100), gray on (110), and red on (111) facets
of γ-Al2O3.

Under realistic experimental conditions, the Lewis acid surface
sites (under-coordinated Al sites) of γ-Al2O3 are partially occupied by hydroxyl groups, and some of the
Lewis basic surface sites (oxygen atoms) are protonated due to surface
hydration. Computational work established that the fully nonhydroxylated
(100) facet is more stable than that of nonhydroxylated (110) facet,50,58 and the presence of hydroxyl groups significantly stabilizes the
(110) facet, making it the most abundant facet.47,48,61 As a result, to assess the activity of γ-Al2O3 under realistic experimental conditions, we
investigated the effect of hydroxylation of γ-Al2O3 (110) (most abundant facet) on methane activation.
Previous studies by Digne and co-workers47,48 demonstrated that the (110) facet of γ-Al2O3 has a hydroxyl coverage of ∼5.9 OH/nm–2 at temperatures 700–950 K (within typical nonoxidative alkane
dehydrogenation conditions). Therefore, we consider eight hydroxylated
configurations of γ-Al2O3 (110) facet
with a hydroxyl coverage of ∼5.9 OH/nm–2 (i.e
four H2O molecules per supercell). In the considered configurations,
different surface sites were hydroxylated, and different surface oxygen
atoms were protonated. We note that in the most stable hydroxylated
configuration, the strongest Lewis acid sites (AlIII and
AlIVb) are now blocked by hydroxyl groups (Figure S4a), suggesting that these sites become
inactive for methane activation.

In addition, it has been suggested
that high-temperature pretreatment
of γ-Al2O3 (activation) can expose defect
AlIII sites that belong to metastable hydrated surfaces.31,32 Sautet and co-workers extensively studied the surface hydration
of γ-Al2O3 and identified two types of
metastable surface hydration models that expose a free AlIII site, namely, Digne’s model (nonreconstructed) and Wischert
model (reconstructed).31,32 Therefore, we considered two
metastable structures with a free AlIII site (strong Lewis
acid) for studying the CH4 activation. Out of the two lowest
energy metastable structures, the nonreconstructed structure, which
is generated by the hydroxylation of one AlIVa and AlIII site (Digne’s model,47Figure S4b) and the protonation of OII sites (Figure S4b) was found
to be 76 kJ/mol higher in energy than the most stable structure. This
surface configuration does not show any reconstruction. Interestingly,
we note that on the AlIII–OIII site pair,
depending on the orientation of methane in the transition state, two
distinct modes of C–H activation exist (Figure S5) because the nonadjacent acid–base sites
involved in this pair are separated by a large distance. These two
C–H activation modes are identified on the AlIII–OIII site pair of both hydrated and nonhydrated
surfaces. We note that the low-energy C–H activation mode (Figure S5) has a transition state with methane
in a tetrahedral-like orientation (Figure S5a–c), whereas in the high-energy mode methane has a distorted geometry
(SN2-like transition state geometry, Figure S5d–f). The distorted structure increases the
energy at the transition state (due to strain).

The C–H
activation barriers of the low-energy mode are presented
in Figure 8. Reaction
profiles for high-energy transition state modes are presented in Figure S6. On the AlIII–OII (adjacent) site pair of the nonreconstructed metastable
hydroxylated configuration, the C–H activation barrier (109.2
kJ/mol, Figure 8a)
was found to be higher than that of the C–H activation barrier
on the AlIII–OII site pair of nonhydrated
configuration (90.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8a). On the AlIII–OIII (nonadjacent)
site pair of nonreconstructed metastable hydrated configuration, the
C–H activation barrier (54.5.kJ/mol, Figure 8b) was found to be lower than that on AlIII–OIII site pair of the nonhydrated configuration
(120.3 kJ/mol, Figure 8b). These results are in agreement with previous reports31,32 where it was suggested that in the presence of bridging hydroxyl
groups on AlIVa, the activity of the AlIII–OIII site pair increases due to the increase in the basicity
of the O atom. The higher C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OII of nonreconstructed hydrated surface
can be attributed to the decrease in basicity of OII site
due to hydrogen bond (in 1.53 Å distance) with the hydrogen atom
bound to the OII site of the AlIVa–OII site pair. The other considered hydrated metastable model
(Figure S4c) of γ-Al2O3 (110), generated by the hydroxylation of both AlIVa site and the protonation of less basic OIII site of AlIVb–OIII site pair (Figure S4c), reconstructed, in agreement with the with previous results
by Wischert et al.31,32 This reconstructed surface is
lower in energy (by −47 kJ/mol) than of the nonreconstructed
surface, but it was found to be higher in energy (by 29 kJ/mol) than
the most stable hydrated surface. On the AlIII–OII (adjacent) site pair of the reconstructed hydrated surface,
the C–H activation barrier (170.1 kJ/mol, Figure 8a) was found to be significantly
higher than that of the C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OII site pair of the nonhydrated surface
(90.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8a). This increase in the barrier on the hydrated reconstructed facet
is likely due to the change in coordination of OII from
dicoordinated to tricoordinated and modification of AlIII acidity due to reconstruction. This change in Lewis acidity basicity
of this site pair in the reconstructed metastable configuration is
demonstrated by the higher final state energy of methane dissociation
on this site pair (Figure 8a) when compared to that of the corresponding nonreconstructed
metastable hydrated and nonhydrated site pairs. On the AlIII–OIII (nonadjacent) site pair of reconstructed
hydrated configuration, the C–H activation barrier (83.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8b) was found to be
lower than that of the C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OIII site pair of nonhydrated configuration
(120.3 kJ/mol, Figure 8b). The aforementioned results clearly demonstrate that the surface
hydration can significantly influence the C–H activation barriers
of methane by modifying the surface Lewis acidity and basicity. The
low methane activation barrier (54.5 kJ/mol, Figure 8b) obtained on a nonadjacent site pair of
metastable surface (generated through high-temperature pretreatment)
rationalizes the experimentally observed high activity of thermally
pretreated γ-Al2O3.28−30 Moreover, previously
demonstrated activity poisoning of thermally preheated alumina by
water can be explained by blocking of the defect active sites (such
as AlIII–OIII site on metastable surfaces)
by strong water adsorption.28,30 Finally, we note that
the final state energy can also be used as a descriptor for methane
activation barriers on hydroxylated metastable surfaces (Figure S7).

Conclusions
We applied density functional
theory (DFT) to investigate the C–H
activation of methane on different sites of three low-index surface
facets of γ-Al2O3. Two potential C–H
activation mechanisms were considered on different sites of varying
Lewis acidity and basicity, the polar and radical mechanism. It was
found that the polar is the prevailing C–H activation mechanism
on γ-Al2O3. We show that the site-dependent
Lewis acidity and basicity can be probed by identifying the band centers
for the unoccupied and occupied bands. Moreover, we address the effect
of surface hydration on C–H activation of methane and show
a modification of the Lewis acid/base properties and C–H activation
behavior. Water generally blocks strong Lewis acid/base site pairs
(catalytic suppression), but in some cases it can enhance activity
of adjacent sites on metastable γ-Al2O3 surfaces. Importantly, we demonstrate that hydrogen dissociative
binding energy and final state energy can be used as descriptors for
the C–H activation on γ-Al2O3.
These descriptors can be used in the construction of structure–activity
relationships for C–H activation of methane and effectively
probe the Lewis acid/base functionality of the metal oxide catalysts.

Methods
The DFT calculations were performed using the CP2K program package.62 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional63 with
Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction method64 was used. TZVP basis sets were used for C, H, and O, and
DZVP basis set was used for Al. Goedecker, Teter, and Hutter pseudopotentials
were employed with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 Ry. The minimum
energy pathways for C–H activation were investigated using
climbing image nudged elastic band calculations as implemented in
CP2K.65 The nonspinel model of alumina
was used in our calculations.47,48 To model the (110),
(100), and (111) facets of γ-Al2O3, p2 × 1, p1 × 2 and p1 × 1 supercells were used (Figure S1), respectively. Supercells with 80 atoms were used for (100) and
(111) surfaces, and 120-atom supercell was used for (110) facet. For
the radical pathway, the supercells with 160 atoms were used for both
(110) and (100) facets (to locate transition states with the correct
localization of spin) with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 Ry. The
two bottom layers were kept frozen at their corresponding bulk positions,
and remaining layers were allowed to relax. The systems were relaxed
using the forces and SCF convergence criterion of 4.0 × 10–4Eh per bohr and 10–7 au, respectively. The binding energy (BE) of hydrogen
atoms was computed, by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on Lewis acid
and base sites of the oxide surface, according to eq 1 1  Where Esurface/H2 is the total
energy of a H2 adsorbed on
the surface, Esurface and EH2 are total energies of the clean surface
and gas-phase H2, respectively. For the electronic structure
analysis (e.g., density of states), DFT calculations with PBE functional
were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package.66−68 Projector augmented wave pseudopotentials and 3 × 3 ×
3 and 6 × 6 × 1 k-points were used for
bulk and surface calculations, respectively, with 520 eV kinetic energy
cutoff. The unoccupied s-band center of Al (εsAl) and occupied p-band center
of O (εpO) are defined as  where EF is the
Fermi energy, ρsAl and ρpO are the PDOS of Al(s) and O(p), and ε is the energy
(in eV).
