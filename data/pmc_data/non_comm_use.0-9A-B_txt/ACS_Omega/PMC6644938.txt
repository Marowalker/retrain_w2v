A metal-free procedure for oxidation
of carbon black (CB), under
mild and ecofriendly conditions, is described. The procedure, based
on 5/1 w/w H2O2/H2SO4,
when applied to high-surface-area CB, leads to oxidation contents
(O/C = 0.66) comparable to those obtained for graphite with the more
aggressive and metal-based Hummers method (O/C 0.63). Oxidized nanocarbons
are able to activate transesterification reactions under solvent-free
conditions. Activation of transesterification reactions is much more
effective by oxidized CB than by graphene oxide.

1 Introduction
The
large diffusion of carbon-based materials as heterogeneous
catalysts is essentially due to their unique set of properties such
as physical stability, accessibility, easy handling, and recyclability.

Recently, the emerging application of carbon materials as cheap
and metal-free catalysts has attracted much attention1−6 mainly to graphite oxide (GO) and exfoliated GO (eGO, i.e., graphene
oxide), as a solid acid in Friedel–Crafts7,8 or
aza-Michael additions,9 Mukaiyama–Michael
addition,10 Mukaiyama aldol reaction,11 and in esterification reaction,12 meeting the need of environmentally benign alternatives
to current organic chemical processes.

Oxidation procedures,
widely explored for graphite,13−15 are much less studied for cheaper
and easily available carbon black
(CB), obtained by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon or as a byproduct
of many industrial processes.16 The well-known
Hummers procedure,15 effective for converting
graphite into GO, is also effective for converting CB into oxidized
CB (oCB). In particular, high oxidation degrees (O/C > 0.8) can
be
achieved starting from the high-surface-area CB (SACB ≈
150 m2/g).17 oCB exhibits functional
groups (epoxides, carboxylic acids, and hydroxyl groups),17 which are expected to promote many reactions.
In particular, the large amount of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups suggests
oCB as a candidate as a carbocatalyst for many important reactions.
Although the Hummers procedure is effective with both graphite and
CB samples leading to high-functionalized carbon materials, the not-negligible
amount of metal impurities could affect the oxidized materials, generating
new active sites for catalytic reactions.6

In the first part of this paper, we present a complete metal-free
procedure for oxidation of CB under mild and ecofriendly conditions,
which is effective on high-surface-area CB. This procedure leads to
oCB, with sulfur contents comparable to those obtained by the Hummers
method.

In the second part of the paper, we evaluate the catalytic
activity
of different oxidized carbon materials in transesterifications (Scheme 1), that is, relevant
organic reactions often used for laboratory and industrial applications.
In fact, the ester-to-ester transformation is particularly useful
when the parent carboxylic acids are labile and difficult to isolate.
Moreover, some esters are readily or commercially available, more
stable, and easy to handle, and thus they conveniently serve as starting
materials in transesterification. Transesterification is relevant
not only for organic synthesis but also for the production of esters
of oils and fats16 as well as for many
kinds of polymerizations, for example, ring opening of lactones18 or for curing of alkyd resins.19

Scheme 1 General Scheme for Transesterification Reaction
To accelerate the reaction,
an acid or a base catalyst is often
employed and it can be homogeneous20 or
heterogeneous21−23 with the system. Many disadvantages of the homogeneous
catalysts, such as corrosivity, sensitiveness to purity of reactants,
and difficulty in their removal from generated wastewaters, limit
their application and drive the catalyst choice toward the heterogeneous
ones. The use of solid catalysts for chemical transformation has received
much attention owing to their properties such as easy recovery, reuse,
and environmental friendliness. In particular, the possibility to
catalyze the reaction under acidic condition was particularly explored
for biodiesel production where the inorganic solid acids, such as
zeolite,21 niobic acid,22 and sulfonated zirconia,24 were
used. Strongly acidic ion-exchange resins, such as, Amberlyst 15 and
Nafion NR50,25 can also be effective, although
their applications are limited by their high cost and low stability.

We herein report the activation, under solvent-free conditions,
of many transesterification reactions by several oxidized carbon materials:
GO, graphene oxide (i.e., eGO), oCB by Hummers procedure (oCB-1),
and oCB by the H2O2/H2SO4 mixture (oCB-2). oCB is revealed to be a highly more efficient transesterification
catalyst than eGO.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Carbon Black Oxidation
Graphite and
CB samples used in the present study exhibit high surface areas (330
and 151 m2/g, respectively). The elemental analyses of
high-surface-area graphite and CB, after oxidation by the Hummers
method15 or by the presently proposed method
based on H2O2/H2SO4 (5/1
by volume), are compared in Table 1. As recently described,17 the Hummers oxidation method works well with both graphite and CB.
The presently proposed method, based on H2O2/H2SO4, even when applied on high-surface-area
graphite leads to a rather low oxidation degree (O/C = 0.13), which
is much lower than the one obtained by the oxidation of the same graphite
by the Hummers method (O/C = 0.71). The proposed method is much more
effective with high-surface-area CB and leads to an oxidation degree
(O/C = 0.66), while is instead poorly effective on the CB samples
of low surface area. For instance, the same procedure applied to a
CB sample with SA = 36 m2/g provides an oCB sample with
the O/C ratio close to 0.04.

a CB has a surface area of 151 m2/g.

b Graphite has a surface
area of 330
m2/g.

The elemental
analysis results of Table 1 also indicate that both oxidation procedures
leave the oCB sample with a high sulfur content, nearly double than
that of graphite.

It is worth adding that although the surface
area of CB is noticeably
reduced after oxidation by using the Hummers method, going down from
151 to 61 m2/g, the surface area of CB after oxidation
with the H2O2/H2SO4 mixture
is almost saved around 100 m2/g.

Additional differences
emerge from the comparison of infrared (IR)
spectra of eGO and oCB (Figure 1). In particular, the oCB-1 sample presents well-defined peaks
in the range 1300–900 cm–1 corresponding
to the vibrations of ether, epoxy, alcoholic, and carboxylic groups
which are much better defined than that for graphene oxide26 (Figure 2, oCB-1 vs eGO), as well as two peaks at 885 and 849 cm–1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching and deformation
vibrations of epoxy groups, respectively, and a 575 cm–1 peak which could be possibly attributed to peroxides.26

Figure 1 FTIR spectra in the range 2000–450 cm–1 of oxidized graphene (GO and eGO) and oCB, by the Hummers method
(oCB-1) or by the H2O2/H2SO4 mixture (oCB-2).

before (a) and after (b) activation of transesterification
reaction.

Moreover, the well-defined peak
at 1170 reveals the contribution
of an increased amount of the sulfonic group.17

Also interesting is a comparison between Fourier transform
infrared
(FTIR) spectra of the oCB samples as oxidized by the two different
methods. As a matter of fact, although the two spectra were substantially
superimposable and the 1170 cm–1 peak related to
the presence of the sulfonic group is consistent for both the oCB
samples as well, the carboxylic peak at 1718 cm–1 is much less intense for the CB sample oxidized by H2O2/H2SO4 (oCB-2) than for the sample
oxidized by the Hummers method (oCB-1) (Figure 2, oCB-1 vs oCB-2).

2.2 Transesterification
Reactions
In
a preliminary study, the ability of different nanocarbons to activate
transesterification reactions was tested for ethyl 3-phenylpropanoate 1 and benzyl alcohol 2 under solvent-free conditions
using a molar ratio of 1:2 equiv for 1 and 2, respectively. The possible catalytic activity was explored by changing
the loading and temperature conditions of nanocarbons (Table 2).

a All yields refer to the isolated
products.

b The reaction was
performed using
1/1 molar ratio of reagents 1 and 2.

As reported in Table 2, in the absence of a catalyst under solvent-free conditions,
the
reaction has a low yield (entry 1, Table 2) and even increasing the temperature to
80 °C, no significant improvement was detected (entry 2, Table 2). The yield remains
low also in the presence of high-surface-area graphite (entry 3, Table 2), which has instead
relevant catalytic activities for other reactions.10,27

The reaction, again under solvent-free conditions, is clearly
activated
by 5 wt % GO both at 60 °C and at 80 °C (entry 4 and 6, Table 2) with only a minor
yield increase with a prolonged reaction time (entry 7, Table 2). It is worth adding that the
increase of nanocarbon loading or the reduction of the amount of alcohol
does not improve the yields (entry 5 and 9, Table 2).

Significant increases of yields
are instead obtained by replacing
the crystalline GO with derived graphene oxide (eGO). In fact, as
reported in Table 2 (entry 8), the use of GO after exfoliation by ball milling positively
influence the reactivity by increasing the yield up to 85%.

Additional relevant yield improvements are obtained by conducting
the reaction in the presence of oCB-1, as oxidized by Hummers oxidation,
providing the product 3a in 92% (entry 10, Table 2), and mainly in the presence
of oCB-2 powder, as obtained from the new and mild oxidation procedure,
providing the product in 99% yield in only 18 h (entry 11, Table 2).

To evaluate
the generality of the method, some reactions with different
alcohols 2a–i and esters 1a–c at 80 °C were performed with some of the oxidized carbon materials
under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 General Scope of the Reaction
As reported in Table 3, although transesterification reaction proceeds quite
well already
in the presence of eGO (entries 1–4, 7, and 8 of Table 3), a reduction of reaction time
and higher yields are assured by the presence of oCB-1 and oCB-2.

Table 3 Transesterification Reaction of Alcohol 2a–i with 1a–c Ester Catalyzed
by eGO (5 wt %), oCB-1 (5 wt %) and oCB-2 (5 wt %)
a All the
yields refer to the isolated
products.

It has to be noted
that although in the presence of aromatic esters
the reaction catalyzed by eGO proceeds with a very poor (entries 4
and 8 of Table 3) and
sometimes no yield (entries 5 and 6 of Table 3), the same reactions catalyzed by oCB-1
and oCB-2 proceed with moderate to excellent yields with sensible
reduction of reaction time. The more efficient activation of the transesterification
reactions is possibly due to the higher concentration on the oCB surface
of the sulfonic groups, which are more acidic than carboxylic groups.28,29

It has to be noted that although the O/C ratio of oCB-2 is
lower
than that of oCB-1 (0.66 vs 0.83), the almost same sulfur content,
about 6%, associated to a higher surface area of oCB-2 (100 m2/g) than the one reported for oCB-1 (61 m2/g),
makes comparable the activity of two catalysts proposed.

Therefore,
to meet the growing need of more environmental and benign
procedures, the use of catalyst oCB-2 obtained by the new mild and
ecofriendly procedure has to be preferred. In this way, the reaction
can be performed under solvent-free conditions and by using a completely
metal-free catalyst obtained by a green procedure.

It is worth
adding that such a great efficiency in the presence
of just 5 wt % oCB-2 heating the mixture at 80 °C under solvent-free
conditions is a very intriguing result. In fact, the most reported
procedures30,31 need to work for 16–24
h to provide similar results by using metals and in high catalyst
loading, and similar efficiency has been previously reported just
by using higher catalyst loading, at least 30 wt % sulfonated polypyrene,
but in the presence of aromatic and aliphatic solvents as well as
using necessarily higher temperature.31

Recently a sulfonated graphene oxide monolith was used for
the
esterification reaction giving good yields in 90 min but in the presence
of catalyst loading close to 20 wt % and again in the presence of
aromatic solvents.32

Finally, we
investigated the recyclability of the recovered oCB-2
after the transesterification reaction between 3-phenylpropanoate 1 and benzyl alcohol 2. Recovered oCB-2 has a
strongly reduced activation ability, with the yield reduced from 99%
down to 45%, possibly because of a thermal desulfonation with consequent
reduction of acidity. In fact, as reported in the IR spectrum of Figure 2, many vibrational
peaks of oCB-2 disappear after the reaction (b vs a), indicating a
decrease of concentration of the oxidized functional groups, mainly
sulfonic groups, as also confirmed by the elemental analysis (sulfur
content becoming less than 1.5 wt %).

Interestingly, the recovered
oCB-2 sample can be again oxidized
under mild conditions by using the H2O2/H2SO4 5/1 mixture. The reoxidized oCB-2 sample can
be reused for the activation of transesterification reactions, providing
an efficiency very close to that of the first run (95% yield) (Figure 3). The activator
is cheap and can be recovered and reoxidized by green and ecofriendly
procedures.

Figure 3 oCB recovering and recycling.

3 Conclusions
A metal-free procedure
for oxidation of CB, under mild and ecofriendly
conditions, is described. The procedure, based on 5/1 w/w H2O2/H2SO4, leads, for high-surface-area
CB, to an oxidation degree comparable to the one obtained with the
more aggressive and metal-based Hummers method with the analogous
sulfur content. This procedure is, however, poorly effective on low-surface-area
CB as well as on graphite, even if exhibiting a very high surface
area.

All considered oxidized nanocarbons are able to activate
a broad
scope of transesterification reactions under solvent-free conditions.
Activation occurs already by graphene oxide, but it is much more pronounced
by oCB, providing the product in reduced reaction times. The recovered
oCB-2 can be again oxidized under mild conditions by using the H2O2/H2SO4 5/1 mixture. The
reoxidized oCB-2 sample can be reused for the activation of transesterification
reactions, providing an efficiency very close to that of the first
run.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
High-surface-area graphite,
with Synthetic Graphite 8427 as trademark, was purchased from Asbury
Graphite Mills Inc., with a minimum carbon wt % of 99.8.

The
used CB samples, with surface area of 151 m2/g, were purchased
from Cabot.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used without
any further purification. Thin-layer chromatography was performed
on a silica gel 60 F254 0.25 mm glass plates Merck and nonflash chromatography
was performed on a silica gel (0.063–0.200 mm) (Merck). All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a
DRX 400 MHz instrument, by using CDCl3 (δ = 7.26
ppm in 1H NMR spectra and δ = 77.0 ppm in 13C NMR spectra) as a solvent (400.135 MHz for 1H and 100.03
MHz for 13C).

For the products 3aa, 3ac, 3ae, and 3ad, the 1H NMR and 13C
NMR match with those reported in the literature.33−37

4.2 Oxidation of Graphite and
CB with the Hummers
Procedure
GO and oCB were prepared by the Hummers method.15 Sulfuric acid (120 mL) and sodium nitrate (2.5
g) were introduced into a 2000 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask
immersed into an ice bath, and 5 g of carbon samples was added under
magnetic stirring. After obtaining a uniform dispersion, 15 g of potassium
permanganate was added very slowly to minimize the risk of explosion.
The reaction mixture was thus heated to 35 °C and stirred for
24 h. Deionized water (700 mL) was added in small amounts into the
resulting black and dark green slurry of CB and graphite, respectively,
under stirring and, finally, gradually adding 5 mL of H2O2 (30 wt %). The obtained sample was poured into 7 L
of deionized water and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15
min with a Hermle Z 323 K centrifuge. The isolated GO and oCB powders
were first washed twice with 100 mL of a 5 wt % HCl aqueous solution
and subsequently washed with 500 mL of deionized water. Finally, the
powders were dried at 60 °C for 12 h. About 7.5 g of GO and 6.5
g of oCB powders were obtained. The obtained oxygen/carbon weight
ratio is 0.71 for GO and 0.83 for oCB.

4.3 Oxidation
of CB by H2O2/H2SO4
Oxidation of commercial CB
was carried out in 5/1 H2O2/H2SO4. The CB (500 mg) was added into 500 mL of 30 wt % H2O2 in water under magnetic stirring. Then, H2SO4 was slowly dropped into the uniform dispersion. After
24 h, the mixture was diluted with 1.5 L of deionized water and then
centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min with an Awel centrifuge.
The isolated oCB powders were washed with 500 mL of deionized water.
Finally, the powders were dried at 60 °C for 12 h. About 1.3
g of oCB (oCB-2) powders was obtained with a oxygen/carbon weight
ratio of 0.66.

4.4 Exfoliation of GO by Ball
Milling
The GO powders were introduced in a 125 mL ceramic
jar (inner diameter
of 75 mm) together with the stainless steel balls (10 mm in diameter)
and were dry-milled in a planetary ball mill (Retsch GmbH 5657 Haan)
for 2 h with a milling speed of 500 rpm and a ball-to-powder mass
ratio of 10:1.

4.5 Transesterification Reactions
The
reactions were carried out in a flask. Details were given for the
reaction of ethyl 3-phenylpropanoate (1 mmol, 178.2 mg, 176 μL)
and benzyl alcohol (2 mmol, 216.3 mg, 208 mL). The reactants were
added to the catalyst (5 wt % compared to the ester) at 80 °C.
The reaction was stirred at the same temperature for the time indicated.
The reaction mixture was extracted with ethylacetate (AcOEt), and
the combined organic phase was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography
(silica gel, petroleum ether/EtOAc, gradient) to obtain the pure product.
