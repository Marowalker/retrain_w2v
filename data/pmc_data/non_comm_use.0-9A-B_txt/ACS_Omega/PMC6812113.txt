In
this article, a new diesel particulate filter (DPF) system with
reciprocating flow is proposed, and an experimental study on the characteristics
of the active–passive component regeneration of the DPF system
is carried out. Several control parameters such as temperature distribution,
pressure difference, and pollution emissions of the DPF system are
measured for different reciprocating cycles. The mechanism of reciprocating
flow regeneration of the DPF system and the effects of the reciprocating
flow cycle on the performance of the DPF system are analyzed. Results
show that (1) the DPF system can use a tiny amount of extra fuel to
maintain the chemical reaction, which in turn realizes the regeneration
of the catalyzed DPF because of its properties of heat recovery and
reverse blowing of ash; (2) with the increase in the reciprocating
flow cycle, the temperature profile moves toward the downstream side
of the DPF system and the fluctuation amplitudes of the components
of CO, NO, and NO2 increase; (3) if reasonable temperature
distribution is formed in the DPF system for a certain reciprocating
cycle, the regeneration efficiency can be obviously improved and the
average content of particulate matter emission can be kept at quite
a low level.

==== Body
Introduction
The influence of particulate matter (PM)
emission from diesel engines
on the human health and environment has received wide attraction in
recent years.1,2 Thus, many countries have established
strict statutes to limit PM emission of engines. These increasingly
stringent regulations are driving manufacturers to develop efficient
after-treatment techniques which can remove PM emission from diesel
engines.3,4 It is recognized that the most widely used
approach to remove PM emission from diesel engines is a diesel particulate
filter (DPF).5

Although a typical
wall-flow DPF can remove PM in excess of 95%
over a wide range of engines,6 the DPF
is designed to keep a certain quantity of PM. The overloaded PM would
create a blockage to the flow through the DPF, eventually produce
an excessively high pressure drop of the flow through the DPF and
prevent the engine operation.7 Therefore,
the DPF needs to be designed to provide a reliable way of removing
PM accumulated in the filter in order to restore its PM collection
capacity.8 Removing PM in the filter is
known as the regeneration of DPF, which is a main technical challenge
in the practical application of the DPF.

There are mainly two
types of regenerations of DPF: active regeneration
and passive regeneration. Active regeneration periodically removes
the PM trapped in a DPF through controlled oxidation with O2 at 550 °C or higher temperatures.9 In this case, the heat must be supplied from outside sources, such
as an electric heater, a microwave heater, and a flame-based burner.10 The external energy used for heating would increase
the cost of a DPF system because of complex supplements.11 On the other hand, passive regeneration utilizes
an ongoing catalytic reaction at the exhaust gas temperature to oxidize
the PM trapped in a DPF without additional fuel. Diesel oxidant catalyst
(DOC)-assisting DPF regeneration is typical of the passive regeneration
method which is also named the continuously regenerating trap (CRT)
system. The CRT system is installed with a DOC where NO is preferentially
converted to NO2 before a DPF and NO2 is used
to oxidize PM trapped in the filter below 300 °C.12 In order to achieve the best performance, however,
the CRT system should satisfy two conditions: the temperature should
be in the range 250–450 °C and the NOx/soot ratio should be adequately high. Otherwise, the produced
NO2 will be too low to oxidize soot. It should be noticed
that both hydrocarbon (HC) and CO would be the secondary pollutants
from incomplete oxidation conversion of the soot in the CRT system.

It needs to be mentioned that both active regeneration and passive
regeneration of the DPF cannot keep the filter clean for a long term.
In order to overcome this problem, the active–passive component
regeneration of the DOC-assisting DPF is a traditional option.13 A certain amount of the fuel is injected into
the cylinder in the late stage of the combustion process, or a certain
amount of the fuel is injected into the exhaust pipe at the upstream
of a DOC.14−16 The DOC is used to oxidize the fuel, heat the downstream
DPF, and promote the passive regeneration of the DPF. In-cylinder
injection of the fuel has an advantage that no additional fuel injection
device is needed, whereas a main disadvantage is that the lubricating
oil of the diesel engine will be diluted by the fuel. In-exhaust-pipe
direct injection can avoid oil dilution; this becomes the main technical
approach of the active–passive component regeneration of the
DOC-assisting DPF.

It is known that the active–passive
component regeneration
of the DOC-assisting DPF should maintain the temperature in the DOC
and DPF within a suitable range. Only the temperature in the DOC is
kept in the range of 250–450 °C; NO can be preferentially
converted to NO2. The temperature in the DPF should not
only be high enough to burn the soot accumulated in the DPF but also
be kept below a certain threshold to prevent the DPF from being damaged.
As a result, this regeneration method will be facing a challenge on
how to control the temperature in the DOC and DPF. This is due to
the fact that several factors need to be concerned; they are the wide
range of engine operations, thermal inertia of the DOC and DPF, the
complexities of the reactions in the DOC and DPF, and the injection
model of the fuel injectors.17,18 In addition, all forms
of regeneration can only remove combustible constituents of the PM
trapped in the DPF and cannot remove incombustible constituents remaining
behind as ash. After a long period of operation, the DPF still needs
to be disassembled to clean up the residues in the filter.19−21

Reciprocating flow regeneration (RFR) has also been identified
to be an effective means to realize active–passive component
regeneration of the DPF utilizing a tiny amount of the additional
fuel.22,23 RFR exploits heat recovery properties to
provide a high-temperature region that maintains the regeneration
of the filter. However, the temperature gradients at the inlet and
outlet of the DPF not only defer the regeneration process but also
result in additional thermal stress. To address these issues, Zheng
et al. proposed an RFR structure in which two inert monolith blocks
with a flow-through passage are installed at both the ends of a DPF.24 The monolith blocks can enhance heat recuperation,
reduce the temperature gradient, and maintain a more stable temperature
distribution in the DPF. Furthermore, Zheng et al. improved the RFR
configuration with two DOCs and a noncatalytic DPF.25 Each DOC is placed at a location where the catalytic activity
can be maintained and the catalytic light-off temperature can be kept
in RFR operation. The improved RFR device has a significant advantage
in supplemental energy saving when compared to the standard DOC and
DPF configuration under the same operation conditions.

RFR is
a highly complex physical and chemical reaction process
that combines periodically reciprocating flow, PM separation, multiphase
reactions, and heat and mass transfer over a range of temporal and
spatial domains. To the best of authors’ knowledge, there are
few published reports on applying the concept of a periodically reciprocating
flow to the exhaust after the treatment system of the diesel engine.
There is also no literature on investigating the mechanism of the
new DPF system combining the RFR with the component regeneration of
the DOC-assisting DPF. There is still much room to be investigated
further in this research area.

In the current work, a new DPF
system based on the concept of combining
the RFR with the active–passive component regeneration of the
DOC-assisting DPF is proposed and designed. The proposed new DPF system
consists of a catalyzed DPF (cDPF) and two DOCs. There is a space
interval between every DOC and the cDPF. The new DPF system uses periodically
reciprocating flow, chemical reaction, releasing heat and storing
heat to form a stable temperature distribution that a high-temperature
region is located in central DPFs and two low-temperature regions
are located in the DOCs on both sides. The new DPF system uses a small
amount of extra fuel to maintain the oxidation conversion of the soot
trapped, uses a downstream DOC to oxidize HC and CO from incomplete
oxidation conversion of soot, and utilizes the reverse flow to blow
away the ash accumulated in the filter. Furthermore, we will experimentally
study the temperature distribution, the treatment of pollution, the
mechanism of the RFR of the new DPF system, and the effects of the
reciprocating flow cycle on the performance of the DPF system.

Experimental
Apparatus and Method
Experimental Apparatus
As shown
in Figure 1, the experimental
system mainly
consists of a diesel engine, exhaust pipelines, a DPF system, and
a measurement system.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental setup.

The diesel engine is a six-cylinder in-line with water cooling,
turbo-charging and intercooling, four strokes direct injection heavy-duty
diesel engine. The main specifications of the engine are given in Table 1. The diesel engine
burns 0# diesel oil (National V emission standard) and is operated
under ideal conditions.

The DPF system is composed of two DOCs, a cDPF, and
flow pipelines
as shown in Figure 2. Two DOCs are symmetrically arranged on both sides of the cDPF and
a structure of DOC + cDPF + DOC is formed. Two pairs of solenoid butterfly
valves in the flow pipelines use synchronous opening and closing to
control the periodically reciprocating flow of the airflow in the
DPF system.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the DPF system.

Each DOC is a cordierite ceramic monolith that has a honeycomb
structure with parallel channels. Al2O3 and
Ce(Zr)O2 catalyst carriers coat the channel walls and support
bimetallic Pt/Pb catalysts. As shown in Figure 3, the filter of the cDPF is a wall-flow filter
with the alternate channels plugged at one end and open at the opposite
end. The cordierite particles sintered together form the porous matrix
of the internal wall between the alternate channels. The wall-flow
filter is also coated by a layer of Al2O3 and
Ce(Zr)O2 as catalyst carriers, and the catalyst carriers
support bimetallic Pt/Pb catalysts. The characteristics of the DOC
and the cDPF are given in Table 2. The ratio of Pt to Pb is 4:1 in the catalysts used
in the DOC and cDPF. Pt in the catalysts can enhance NO oxidation
to NO2. A small amount of Pb can improve the thermal stability
of the catalysts and reduce the light-off temperature of soot, CO,
and HC oxidation.

The exhaust
pipelines extend from the engine exhaust pipe to the
DPF system, through passing a main line or a bypass line. Supplemental
energy will be applied to increase the DPF substrate temperature in
order to initiate thermal regeneration. When the exhaust gas flows
into the DPF system through the bypass line, a 30 kW electrical heater
is used to heat the exhaust gas. When the exhaust gas flows into the
DPF system through the main line, a tiny amount of additional fuel
is introduced at the inlet of the DPF system. Pure propane gas (99.9%)
is chosen as the additional fuel in order to facilitate measuring
and ensure the measurement accuracy.

The flow rate of the exhaust
gas is measured using a vortex flow
meter, and the flow rate of the propane gas is measured using a glass
rotameter. The upstream and downstream pressure of the DPF system,
the upstream pressure of the exhaust pipelines, and the ambient pressure
are measured using piezoresistive pressure transmitters. The temperature
at different locations of the DPF system, the upstream temperature
of the exhaust pipelines, and the ambient temperature are measured
using K-type thermocouples. The thermocouples are also arranged along
the axis of the DPF system in order to measure the temperature of
the channel walls in the axis of the DOCs and cDPF.

The concentrations
of PM emission in the exhaust gas are measured
using a SMG smoke meter, and the components of gaseous pollutants
are measured using a Testo 350 flue gas analyzer. The measuring positions
of the components of the exhaust gas are set at the measurement hole
A and measurement hole B, as shown in Figure 2. An Agilent 34970A data acquisition instrument
is used to acquire the experimental data and transmit the data into
a personal computer.

Experimental Method
At the start
of the DPF system,
the main line is closed while the bypass line is opened. The electrical
heater is used to heat the exhaust gas to the temperature starting
the DPF system. Meanwhile, a certain amount of the propane gas is
introduced at the inlet. As a reasonable temperature distribution
in the DPF system is established, the main line is opened and the
bypass line is closed. When the temperatures periodically fluctuate
and the fluctuating amplitude are nearly equal at every measuring
position, the DPF system is considered to be under stable operation
conditions, and the experimental parameters including temperature,
pressure, pollution emission concentrations, and PM concentrations
are measured accordingly.

During the experiment, the reciprocating
flow cycle in the DPF system is separately set at 30, 50, 70, and
90 s, the volume flow of the exhaust gas is kept at 248.3 m3/h, the volume flow of the propane gas introduced at the inlet is
0.18 m3/h, and the exhaust temperature is 396 K at the
inlet.The components of the exhaust gas at the inlet of the DPF system
are listed in Table 3.

The mean concentration of

the DPF system is in a stable operation status.

Analysis of RFR
As the DPF system utilizes a tiny amount of propane gas as the
additional fuel to maintain a stable operation, the DPF system can
filter PM, remove the CO and HC emissions, and realize the regeneration
of the periodically reciprocating flow, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Heat-stored and heat-rejected
zone during a cycle.

During the forward flow
cycle (Tf),
the diesel exhaust gas is introduced in the left DOC, flowed through
the cDPF and the right DOC in turns. The conversion of carbon monoxide
(CO) can reach 90% and the conversion of hydrocarbon can reach 80%
at 623 K in the DOC.27 Consequently, the
propane gas, CO, and HC in the exhaust gas are oxidized to H2O and CO2 by the residual oxygen of the exhaust gas in
the left DOC. The hydrocarbons oxidized also include the volatile
constituents adsorbed in the PM. The volatile constituents are mainly
the soluble organic fraction (SOF) released from the PM at Tsof = 346 K.6 At
the same time, nitrogen monoxide (NO) is partially converted to nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) in the exhaust gas in the left DOC.

As the diesel exhaust gas flows through the cDPF, the PM contained
in exhaust gas is trapped and deposited on the walls of inlet passages
during the Tf, as shown in Figures 3 and 5. After the DPF system is started, the temperatures in the cDPF can
be kept higher than 823 K. The temperature of the light off of soot
oxidation is Tl2 = 873 K in loose contact
between the soot and catalyst, and the temperature of the light off
is Tl1 = 693 K in intimate contact for
a cDPF.28−31 The soot particulates on the walls are oxidized into CO2 and the residual ash particles remained on the walls of the inlet
passages in the cDPF, as shown in Figures 3 and 5.32,33 The short residence time results in the incomplete soot oxidation
and the rapid CO generation in the cDPF. CO from the cDPF is oxidized
into CO2 in the right DOC.

Figure 5 Schematic diagram of filtering particulates.

In the upstream region of the DPF system, the solid
frame in the
left DOC and the cDPF has a higher temperature than the diesel exhaust
gas. The solid frame in the region releases heat to the exhaust gas
during the Tf, as illustrated in Figure 4. In the downstream
region of the DPF system, the chemical reaction in the cDPF and the
right DOC releases heat to the solid frame and the heat is stored
in the solid frame of the heat-storing region. The amount of thermal
storage in the solid frame during Tf is
described by eq 1. 1   2  

During the backward flow half cycle (Tb), the diesel exhaust gas is introduced in the right DOC,
flowed
through the cDPF and the left DOC in turns. During Tb, the solid frame storing heat during the previous Tf releases heat to the exhaust gas and activates
the same chemical reactions in the new upstream region of the DPF
system as in the previous Tf, as seen
from Figure 4. The
releasing heat in the new heat-releasing region during the Tb is described by eq 3. 3   4  

During Tb, the particulates contained
in the exhaust gas are trapped and deposited on the walls of the outlet
passage of the cDPF, as demonstrated in Figures 3 and 5. The soot particulates
are oxidized, and the residual ash particles remained on the walls
of the outlet passages. At the same time, the residual ash particles
on the walls of the inlet passages during the previous Tf are stirred, blown away, and carried away by the reverse
flow, as shown in Figure 5.

During Tb, the chemical
reactions release
heat to the solid frame in the new downstream region of the DPF system.
The amount of thermal storage of the new heat-storing region during Tb is described by eq 5. 5   6  

The same process
of heat storing and heat releasing in the same
location is repeated in the next reciprocating flow cycle. The DPF
system with a reciprocating flow can use a tiny amount of extra fuel
to maintain the chemical reaction, which in turn realizes the continuous
active–passive component regeneration of the cDPF because of
its properties of heat recovery and reversely blowing away the ash.

Results
and Discussion
Temperature Profiles during a Reciprocating
Flow Cycle
As the reciprocating flow cycle is 50 s, temperature
profiles along
the axial direction in the DPF system during a reciprocating flow
cycle are displayed in Figure 6. During each half cycle every temperature distribution is
a trapezoidal profile which exibits a high-temperature region in the
middle (−277.5 mm ≤ X ≤ 63.5
mm) and has high-temperature gradients on both sides. The cDPF is
always kept at a higher temperature than the lighting off of soot
oxidation. Each DOC has a temperature gradient in a range from 360
to 1080 K. The high-temperature region travels at close to a constant
speed from the upstream side of the DPF system toward the downstream
side during each half cycle.

Figure 6 Change of temperature profiles during a cycle,
(a) forward half
cycle and (b) backward half cycle.

At the beginning of a Tf, a temperature
maximum can be observed at X = −277.5 mm near
the upstream side in Figure 6a. During the Tf, the temperature
in the high-temperature region increases and the temperature near
the downstream side increases more rapidly and gradually grows into
a new temperature maximum at X = 0 mm. At the beginning
of the Tb, after the flow direction switches,
the maximum temperature at the end of the previous Tf still remains near the new upstream side as shown in Figure 6b. During the Tb, the temperature within the high-temperature
region decreases and the temperature near the new downstream side
decreases at a slower rate. A new temperature maximum at X = −277.5 mm appears gradually. The downstream maximum will
become a new upstream maximum after the next change in the flow direction.
The changes of temperature profiles during the Tf are not exactly the same with those during the Tb. The main reason could be that an asymmetric temperature
distribution along the axial direction of the DPF system is formed
in the startup process of the DPF system.

Figure 7 shows a
process of storing heat and releasing heat during a reciprocating
flow cycle. The temperature within the region of −351.5 mm
≤ X ≤ −273.5 mm decreasing continuously
illustrates that the solid frame releases heat to the exhaust gas
during the Tf as shown in Figure 6a. The temperature within the
region of −273.5 mm ≤ X ≤ 357.5
mm increasing continuously illustrates that the chemical reaction
releases enough heat to heat the solid frame in the region. The heat
storage in the solid frame of −273.5 mm ≤ X ≤ 357.5 mm during the Tf is represented
by the shadow area in Figure 7a. The heat storage is described by eq 1.

Figure 7 Heat-stored and heat-rejected during a cycle,
(a) forward half
cycle and (b) backward half cycle.

During the Tb, the temperature within
the region of −273.5 mm ≤ X ≤
351.5 mm decreases, and the heat stored during the previous Tf is released to heat the exhaust gas and activate
the chemical reactions as shown in Figure 6b. The releasing heat during the Tb is indicated by the shadow area in the region
in Figure 7b, and its
value is described by eq 3. The temperature within the region of −351.5 mm ≤
X ≤ −273.5 mm increases, and the heat released from
the chemical reactions is stored in the solid frame. The heat stored
during the Tb is indicated by the shadow
area in the region in Figure 7b, and its value is described by eq 5.

A dividing point between the endothermic
regions and exothermic
regions in the DPF system during the Tf and Tb is located in the same position,
that is, X3 = X4. The heat stored in the endothermic regions in the Tf is equal to the heat released in the exothermic regions
in the Tb within the same regions as shown
in Figure 7a,b. The
same process of storing heat and releasing heat in the same location
is repeated in the next reciprocating flow cycle.

Chemical Reactions
during a Reciprocating Flow Cycle
Figure 8 shows the
temperature fluctuation curves at different measuring points in the
DPF system as the reciprocating flow cycle is 50 s. Figure 9 shows the fluctuation curves
of the components of O2, CO, NO, and NO2 at
the outlet with the reciprocating flow in the DPF system. At the beginning
of each half cycle, the lower temperature results in the lower CO
conversion in a new downstream DOC and the CO components increase
rapidly, and then slowly decrease with the temperature growth of the
new downstream during the half cycle.

Figure 8 Temperature fluctuation at different measuring
points.

Figure 9 Profiles of O2, CO, NO, and NO2 at the outlet.

The variation of NO is
associated with NO2, as shown
in Figure 9. At the
beginning of a Tf, the downstream DOC
is at a lower temperature (400–430 K) and the chemical reaction
equilibrium of NO2 and NO is on the NO side, as illustrated
in Figures 8 and 9, and then gradually shifts toward the NO2 side with the increasing temperature in the range of 433–573
K, the NO content decreases, and the NO2 content increases
during the Tf. When the corresponding
conversion is 100% at 573 K, the ratio of NO to NO2 reduces
as the temperature further increases. Therefore, with increasing temperature,
the NO content first increases and the NO2 content decreases
when the temperature is higher than 573 K.

By switching to a
backward flow, the temperature suddenly approaches
to 573 K and the conversion of NO to NO2 nearly reaches
100% in the new downstream DOC at the beginning of the Tb. In this case, the NO content rapidly decreases and
the NO2 content rapidly increases at the beginning of the Tb. Then, the NO content increases and the NO2 content decreases with the increasing temperature after the
temperature is higher than 573 K in the new downstream DOC. The periodical
variation of the O2 content is associated with that of
the component contents of CO, NO2, NO, and NO2 as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 10 shows
the fluctuation curves of the pressure difference ΔP between the inlet and the outlet of the DPF system, PM emission,
and the temperature at the outlet of the DPF system.

Figure 10 Curves of ΔP, PM, and the temperature at
the outlet.

At the beginning of a Tf, the flow
passes the inlet passages, the internal wall, and the outlet passages
in turns in the cDPF. The velocity of the flow decreases along the
inlet passages gradually. A part of soot particles in the flow is
heated and oxidized into ashes. The ashes can be directly deposited
onto the internal walls and form a very thin ash layer used as the
substrate for soot particle deposition. Another part of soot particles
in the flow can be deposited onto the thin ash layer and adhered to
the internal walls.

Because the temperature within the region
of X ≥ −277.53 mm is higher than 623
K in the upstream
DOC, the chemical reaction equilibrium of NO2 and NO is
on the NO side during the Tf. In addition,
the cDPF is always kept at a temperature than 823 K as shown in Figure 6. Most of the soot
particles underlain by the thin ash layer are oxidized into ashes
further with O2 alone and without the NO2 catalytic
action. Because of the inertia force, the ash layer and the captured
soot particles appear first in the rear part of the inlet channel
and then gradually move to the middle part of the inlet channel during
the Tf. At the end of the Tf, most of the ashes and soot particles incompletely oxidized
are accumulated on the internal wall in the rear part of the inlet
channel.

By switching to the backward flow, the flow passes
the outlet passages,
the internal wall, and the inlet passages channel in turns in the
cDPF. At the beginning of the Tb, the
new upstream DOC is at a lower temperature than 623 K and the chemical
reaction equilibrium of NO2 and NO is on the NO2 side. The temperature near the right end of the cDPF is also kept
lower than 823 K as shown in Figure 6. According to the published data in ref (34), the residual particles
attached on the walls at the rear part of the inlet passages during
the previous Tf are stirred by and are
completely oxidized into ashes further with the NO2 catalytic
action, rather than being blown away on the wall immediately. Then,
the ashes produced are shifted along the flow path gradually and are
carried out by the reverse flow at the end of the Tb. However, the content of the ashes produced during every
half cycle is too little to influence the PM emission content of the
DPF system. Subsequently, the deposition state of the PM in the outlet
passages during the Tb is the same as
that in the inlet passages during the previous Tf. As switching to next forward flow, the flow resided in the flow pipelines,
the DOCs channels and the outlet passages of cDPF reversely flows
out the DPF system at the beginning of the Tf. Therefore, the PM content rapidly increases, and then rapidly
decreases at the beginning of the Tf,
as shown in Figure 10.

In the next Tf, because of the
temperature
distribution in the upstream DOC and the cDPF, the residual soot particles
attached on the walls at the rear part of the outlet passages during
the previous Tb are only incompletely
oxidized into ashes with O2 alone. Then, the residual soot
particles are shifted along the flow path gradually and are carried
out by the reverse flow at the end of the Tf. Hence, the PM content rapidly increases at the end of the Tf. By switching to the next backward flow, the
PM content rapidly increases to a peak value, and then rapidly decreases
as shown in Figure 10.

The pressure difference between the inlet and outlet periodically
fluctuates and the fluctuating amplitude of the pressure difference
is nearly equal as shown in Figure 10. This illustrates that the accumulation of the PM
trapped on the internal wall balances with the soot oxidation and
reverses cleaning of the particulates in the cDPF.

Thus, it
can be seen that if a reasonable temperature distribution
in the upstream DOC and cDPF during a half cycle is formed, the regeneration
efficiency of the DPF system can be improved.

Influence of the Reciprocating
Flow Cycle
Figure 11 shows the influence
of the reciprocating flow cycle on the temperature profiles along
the axial direction in the DPF system at the end of the forward half
cycle. The experiment conditions including the flow, components and
temperature of the exhaust gas, and the flow of the propane gas are
the same as in the abovementioned experiment. With the increasing
reciprocating cycle, the temperature profile along the axial direction
in the DPF system moves toward the downstream and the high-temperature
region in the profile slightly becomes wider.

Figure 11 Influence of reciprocating
cycles on temperature profiles.

Figure 12 shows
the varying curves of CO, NO, and NO2 components at the
outlet for different reciprocating cycles. Table 5 shows the mean component of the exhaust
gas at the outlet of the DPF system for different reciprocating cycles.
The mean concentration of PM emission, CO emission, HC emission, and
the mean pressure difference of the DPF system is the average value
of the parameters measured in 30 reciprocating flow cycles as the
DPF system maintains stable operation at the reciprocating flow cycle
set as shown in Table 5.

The periodical change
regulation of CO, NO, and NO2 components
at the outlet with the reciprocating flow is consistent with each
other for different reciprocating cycles. For every reciprocating
cycle, at the beginning of each half cycle, the lower temperature
in the new downstream DOC results in the lower CO conversion and the
CO component increases rapidly. Subsequently, the CO conversion increases
and the CO component slowly decreases with the temperature growth
of the new downstream DOC during the half cycle. Because the temperature
profile moves toward the downstream side with the increasing reciprocating
cycle, the maximum temperature of the downstream DOC increases and
the temperature difference between the downstream DOC and the upstream
DOC increases during a half cycle. Therefore, with the increasing
reciprocating cycle, the peak value of the CO emission fluctuation
increases, the efficiency of CO conversion increases, and the average
CO emission decreases at the outlet of the DPF system, as listed in Table 5.

The periodical
variation of NO emission is associated with NO2 emission
for every reciprocating cycle. At the beginning
of each half cycle, the NO emission decreases and the NO2 emission increases. As the NO emission decreases to the troughs,
the NO2 emission increases to the peaks. Subsequently,
the NO emission increases and the NO2 emission decreases.
With the increasing reciprocating cycle, the fluctuating amplitudes
of NO and NO2 components increase. However, there is little
change in the mean concentration of the NO and NO2 emissions
with the increasing reciprocating cycle.

Figure 13 shows
the varying curves of PM emission with and without C3H8 fuel addition at the outlet for different reciprocating cycles.

Figure 13 Profiles
of the PM at the outlet for different reciprocating cycles.

As the DPF system is operated without C3H8 fuel addition, the soot particles in the flow through
the cDPF cannot
be oxidized into ashes. According to the published data in ref (35), during each half cycle,
no ashes are produced and deposited onto the internal walls to form
an ash layer which is used as the substrate for particle deposition.
The particles carried by the flow can be only deposited on the internal
walls and hardly be adhered to the internal walls. At the beginning of each half
cycle, the flow residing in the flow pipelines, the DOCs channels
and the cDPF passages reversely flow out the DPF system for every
reciprocating cycle. Most of the residual particles deposited on the
internal walls of the cDPF passages during the previous half cycle
are stirred, blown away, and carried away by the reverse flow immediately.
Only a very small amount of the particles on the internal walls are
gradually blown away and carried out in the system by the reverse
flow. Therefore, the PM content rapidly increases, and then rapidly
decreases at the beginning of each half cycle for every reciprocating
cycle. Subsequently, the PM content decreases slowly during the half
cycle as shown in Figure 13. With the increasing reciprocating cycle, the fluctuating
range of the PM content remains almost unchanged at the beginning
of each half cycle.

As the DPF system is operated with C3H8 fuel
addition for the 30 s reciprocating cycle, because the temperature
within the region of X ≥ −277.53 mm
is higher than 623 K in the upstream DOC, the chemical reaction equilibrium
of NO2 and NO is on the NO side during the Tf. In addition, the cDPF is always kept at a higher temperature
than 823 K, as shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. Therefore, most of the soot particles deposited
onto the internal walls in the inlet channel are oxidized into ashes
with O2 alone and without the NO2 catalytic
action. At the end of the Tf, the ashes
and soot particles incompletely oxidized are accumulated on the internal
wall in the rear part of the inlet channel. During the Tb, the upstream DOC is kept at a lower temperature than
623 K and the chemical reaction equilibrium of NO2 and
NO is on the NO2 side. Furthermore, the temperature near
the right end of the cDPF is also kept lower than 823 K. Both the
soot particles remained in the inlet channel during the previous Tf, and the soot particles deposited onto the
internal walls in the outlet channel are completely oxidized into
ashes with the NO2 catalytic action during the Tb.

Because of the flow direction periodically
switching in shorter
time for the 30 s reciprocating cycle, the PM on the internal wall
is stirred more strongly and the contact between the soot and catalyst
is more intimate on the internal wall. The conversion efficiency of
the soot captured on the internal wall is increased. At the beginning of each half cycle,
only the suspended PM in the flow residing in the DPF system reversely
flow out the outlet. Therefore, the fluctuating range of the PM content
with C3H8 fuel addition is lower than that without
C3H8 fuel addition for the 30 s reciprocating
cycle, as shown in Figure 13.

Comparing the 30 s reciprocating cycle with the 50
s reciprocating
cycle noted above, the regeneration efficiency is improved, the average
content of PM emission is only 4.7 mg/m3, and the mean
pressure difference of the DPF system is 697.8 Pa. Thus, it can be
seen that if a reasonable temperature distribution which corresponds
to a reciprocating cycle is formed in the DPF system, the regeneration
efficiency can be improved further.

As the DPF system is operated
with C3H8 for
the 70 and 90 s reciprocating cycle, the process of PM capture and
regeneration is basically the same as that of the 50 s reciprocating
cycle noted above. Because of the temperature distribution in the
upstream DOC, the chemical reaction equilibrium of NO2 and
NO is on the NO side during the Tf, as
shown in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. Most of the soot particles captured on the internal walls in the
inlet channel are oxidized into ashes with O2 during the Tf. At the end of the Tf, most of the ashes and soot particles incompletely oxidized
are accumulated on the internal wall in the rear part of the inlet
channel.

At the beginning of the Tb, for the
70 and 90 s reciprocating cycle, because of the temperature distribution
in the upstream DOC, the chemical reaction equilibrium of NO2 and NO is on the NO2 side. The residual partial soot
particles attached on the internal walls in the inlet passages during
the previous Tf are stirred and are completely
oxidized into ashes further with the NO2 catalytic action.
At the same time, the soot particles deposited onto the internal walls
in the outlet channel are also completely oxidized into ashes with
the NO2 catalytic action. When the temperature in the partial
region of the upstream DOC is higher than 623 K at the later period
of the Tb, only a part of soot particles
deposited onto the internal walls in the outlet channel can be oxidized
into ashes with O2 alone. At the end of the Tb, the residual soot particles are accumulated on the
internal wall in the rear part of the outlet channel. The number of
the residual soot particles on the internal wall in the outlet channel
increases with the increasing reciprocating cycle. Therefore, the
regeneration efficiency of the DPF system decreases and the average
content of PM emission increases with the increasing reciprocating
cycle, as listed in Table 5.

As switching
to a forward flow for 70 s and 90 s cycle, the suspended PM in the
flow residing in the DPF system and a small amount of particles soot
incompletely oxidized on the internal wall of the outlet channel reversely
flow out the DPF system. Therefore, the PM content rapidly increases,
and then rapidly decreases at the beginning of the Tf, as shown in Figure 13. And then, the fluctuating amplitude of PM emission
with C3H8 fuel addition is lower than that without
C3H8 fuel addition as switching from a backward
flow to a forward flow for the 50, 70, and 90 s cycle.

In the
next Tf, because of the temperature
distribution in the upstream DOC, the residual soot particles in the
outlet passages of the cDPF during the previous Tb are only incompletely oxidized into ashes further with
O2 alone. Then, the residual soot particles are shifted
along the flow path gradually and are carried out by the reverse flow
at the end of Tf. Therefore, the PM content
rapidly increases at the end of Tf. By
switching to the next backward flow, the PM content continuously increases
to a peak value, and then rapidly decreases. Therefore, by switching
from the forward flow to the backward flow for the 50, 70, and 90
s cycle, the fluctuating range of the PM content with C3H8 fuel addition is significantly higher than that without
C3H8 fuel addition and increases with the increasing
reciprocating cycle, as shown in Figure 13.

The efficiency of removing PM of
the DPF system is over 95%, the
pressure difference is less than 870 Pa, the CO emission is less than
24 ppm, and the HC emission is near zero for every reciprocating flow
cycle set in the experiment, as listed in Table 5.

Conclusions
An
experimental study on the characteristics of removing pollution
emissions and regeneration of the DPF system with a reciprocating
flow has been carried out. The influence of the reciprocating flow
cycle on the regeneration procedure of the DPF system has also been
analyzed.(1) The DPF system can use the pollutants
in emissions and a tiny amount of extra fuel to maintain the chemical
reaction, periodically releasing heat and storing heat and reversely
blowing away ash, which in turn realize the regeneration of the cDPF.

(2) If a reasonable temperature
distribution
in the upstream DOC and cDPF during a half cycle is formed, the regeneration
efficiency of the DPF system can be improved.

(3) The reciprocating cycles can influence
the operation performance of the DPF system. With the increasing reciprocating
cycle, the temperature profile moves parallel toward the downstream
side and the fluctuating range of CO, NO, and NO2 components
increases.

(4) If a reasonable
temperature distribution
which corresponds to a reciprocating cycle is formed in the DPF system,
the regeneration efficiency can be improved further.
