Efficient materials
capable of capturing toxic metals from water
are widely needed. Herein, a new pyridylpyrazole-β-ketoenol
receptor, X-ray diffraction analyzed, was covalently incorporated
into the silica surface to produce solid and recyclable adsorbent
particles. The new material, fully characterized, revealed extremely
efficient removal of toxic metals from water, with a selectivity order
of Pb(II) > Zn(II) > Cu(II) > Cd(II). The adsorption was
exceptionally
rapid at optimum pH and concentrations, showing Pb(II) removal of
93 mg g–1 within 5 min and maximum Pb(II) adsorption
of 110 mg g–1 after only 20 min. Sorption isotherms
agreed well with the Langmuir model suggesting a monolayer adsorption,
whereas kinetics agreed with the pseudo-second-order model suggesting
a chemisorption binding mechanism. Thermodynamics of adsorption were
fitted with an endothermic and spontaneous process. The material,
recyclable for at least five cycles, is therefore promising for the
cleanup of water polluted by toxic metals, especially lead.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays,
water polluted by toxic metals has generated a lot of
interest and remains the focus of research due to its serious threat
to the environment and human health. These metals, which are toxic
even at very low concentrations, can accumulate and affect the entire
human system.1−4 Lead, as one of the most well-known hazardous pollutants in aquatic
environments, is considered to be one of the most toxic heavy metals.5,6 Therefore, the removal of Pb(II) from the aquatic environment is
both urgent and very important. Various technologies for the treatment
of water, polluted by heavy metals, have been reported, such as liquid
phase extraction,7,8 membrane filtration,9 co-precipitation,10 ion exchangers,11 bioaccumulation,12 and adsorption.13−15 Among all these techniques,
adsorption has attracted greater attention, because of its most promising
and widely applied approaches, simplicity, low cost, environmentally
friendly nature, and its effective elimination ability.16−19 Many adsorbents have been employed for successful removal of metal
ions from aqueous solution such as mesoporous carbon,20 biomass,21 zeolite,22 cellulose,23 magnetic
composite,24 and silica gel.25

Mesoporous silica materials, considered
as environmentally friendly
cleanup tools, have received, a lot of attention because of the large
surface area, modifiable intrinsic properties, excellent thermal and
mechanical stability, and economic feasibility.26−28 The effectiveness
of these adsorbents depends mainly on the affinity of the well-arranged
donor atoms (S, O, and N) present on the surface of the materials.
In this context, several ligands, carrying donor atoms, have been
recently fabricated and immobilized on the silica surface.26−34

In addition, silica-based adsorbents increased to adsorb heavy
metals in aqueous solutions.35−37 Zhao et al. (2018)34 found that the modified silica Fe3O4@SiO2-HE-S was well suited for the removal
of Pb(II) from aqueous media with an adsorption capacity of up to
99.45 mg g–1. A large number of materials capable
of adsorbing Pb(II) from aqueous solutions have been reported31 and their selectivity and efficiency toward
metal ions are highlighted and approved. The hypothesis statement
for practical applications require the development of new adsorbents
with a higher density of adsorption sites.

An important class
of ligands, with a higher affinity for hard
and soft metals, are pyrazole and its derivatives,38−44 which are very promising for the cleaning process. In addition,
the synergism of pyrazole and pyridine ligands provides variable coordination
and nuclear geometries.45−48 Indeed, the pyridine–pyrazole ligands have
attracted the attention of many research teams for their high complexing
capacity toward Pb(II).49,50

These mixed pyridine–pyrazole
ligands are functionalized
with the ketoenol group, an additional binding mode is provided. In
this case, the ligands can act as polydentate donors, resulting in
considerable changes in the structure and properties of the formed
complexes.

With all these considerations and interest, we explored
in this
study the potential of mixed β-ketoenol–pyridine–pyrazole
receptor functionalized silica, based on a novel inorganic–organic
hybrid material (SiNPz-Py), for Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II),
and Cd(II) removal. The effects of several parameters including initial
pH and concentration, contact time, kinetics, adsorption temperature,
regeneration time, and selectivity have been studied in detail and
are discussed to evaluate the adsorption efficiency of metal ions.
The fabricated adsorbent demonstrated its strength and selectivity,
especially toward Pb(II) that is promising for the cleanup of water
contaminated by lead.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Linker Synthesis
The protocol for
the preparation of a novel supramolecular material is given in Scheme 1. The first step
was the synthesis of the target ligand, that is, (Z)-1-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
in its stable conjugated enol tautomeric form. The pics of 1H NMR 3.72 (s, 0.1H, keto, CH2), 7.53 (s, 0.9H, enol,
C–H) confirmed such stability where the enol character is dominant.
The ligand was obtained, in situ, from pyrazole-3-carboxylate, 1-(pyridine-2-yl)
ethanone, and metallic sodium under mild conditions using anhydrous
toluene as the solvent. The structure of the synthesized receptor
was determined on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis, analytical
and spectroscopic data.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of Modified Chelating Material SiNPz-Py
The second step was the preparation of silica supporting
3-aminopropyl.
The reaction was carried out in refluxing toluene and led to the abundance
of amino groups on the silica surface (SiNH2). The last step concerned the condensation of the NH2-groups with the receptor (Z)-1-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
under gentle conditions leading to the new chelating adsorbent SiNPz-Py (Scheme 1). The modified surface was characterized using conventional
analytical and spectroscopic techniques.

2.2 L1 Crystal Structure
L1 crystalizes
in the centrosymmetric triclinic
space group P1̅ (Table 1). The asymmetric unit comprises two molecules
(Figure S1). The L1 molecule consists of dimethyl pyrazole and pyridine rings connected
to a central heterocycle formed by 3-hydroxy-prop-2-en-1-one. This
heterocycle is closed by an intramolecular hydrogen bond realized
between the hydrogen atom bond to O1 and O2 atoms (Figure 1). The molecule is not planar
and forms dihedral angles between the central plane of the hydroxy-carbonyl
moiety and the plane of the pyridine ring (10.37°) or the plane
of the pyrazolic ring (5.95°). The crystal packing (Figure S2) reveals π–π interaction
between the pyrazole rings.

2.3 Materials Characterization
2.3.1 Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis
of SiNPz-Py shows an increase in nitrogen and carbon
percentages (%C: 8.10(6) and %N: 2.44(2)) compared to SiNH2 (%C: 4.46(6) and %N: 1.65(2)) due to the additional
amount of organic matter immobilized on the silica network, thus supporting
successful functionalization.

2.3.2 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Characterization
FTIR spectra (Figure 2) demonstrated the
existence of abundant functional groups in free
silica (SiG), SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py. Indeed, SiG exhibited bands at 1100
and 970 cm–1 representative of asymmetrical and
symmetric Si–O–Si vibrations and a band vibration of
O–H at 3351 cm–1. For SiNH2, new bands appeared at 2941 and 1560 cm–1 relative to CH2 and N–H vibrations, respectively,
proving the successful fixation of the aminopropyl group on SiG.51,52 The reaction of amines on the
silica surface with L1 causes the formation
of new bands at 1461 and 1535 cm–1 corresponding
to ν(C=C) and ν(C=N) vibrations, respectively.
These results confirm that (Z)-1-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
has been successfully grafted on the SiNH2 surface.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of SiG, SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py.

2.3.3 Scanning Electron Micrographs (SEM)
Scanning electron micrographs (SEM), given in Figure 3, show a clear difference in the morphology
of the surface, ranging from smooth for the nonfunctionalized silica
particles (SiG) to rough for the hybrid material (SiNPz-Py). The rough surface confirmed the good support of
the organic part, beneficial for metal adsorption.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs of SiG, SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py.

2.3.4 Material
Surface Properties
The
specific surface area (SBET) of SiG, SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py obtained by nitrogen adsorption at several pressures are shown in Figure 4. A decrease was
observed when comparing SiG (305.21 ± 0.79 m2 g–1) to SiNH2 (283.08
± 0.77 m2 g–1). This was due to
the obstruction of N2(g) molecules by organic moieties
anchored onto the silica matrix, thus reducing its surface.53−55 This decrease also affected the pore volumes which also decreased
from 0.770 ± 0.002 cm3 g–1 for SiG to 0.690 ± 0.002 cm3 g–1 for SiNH2. Further immobilization decreased
the pore volume to 0.510 ± 0.001 cm3 g–1 for SiNPz-Py. Nevertheless, the specific surface area
of SiNPz-Py increased to 298.51 ± 1.12 m2 g–1 because of the increasing roughness of the
surface, as evidenced by SEM imaging, and the clogging of the support
by the ligand.

and thermogravimetric
profiles (B) of SiG, SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py.

2.3.5 Thermogravimetric
Analyses
Weight
loss as well as thermal stability were investigated over the temperature
range of 25–800 °C for the three materials, that is, SiG, SiNH2, and SiNPz-Py (Figure 4). The SiG sample showed two decomposition steps. The first weight
loss of 3.15% in the range of 25–110 °C due to water evaporation,
and the second weight loss of 5.85% from 150 to 800 °C due to
the condensation of silanol groups.54,55 The SiNH2 material also exhibited two decomposition
steps of 1.56% (from 25 to 100 °C) and 7.21% (from 210 to 800
°C) corresponding to the physically adsorbed water and decomposition
of propylamine part, respectively. For the hybrid material (SiNPz-Py), two stages of decomposition were also observed.
The first weight loss of 3.34%, in the range of 25–169 °C,
was attributed to the decomposition of water absorbed on the surface.
The second weight loss of 12.99%, in the interval of 169–800
°C, originates from the thermal decomposition of the organic
functional groups.

2.4 Adsorption Studies
2.4.1 Effect of pH of the Solution
pH
is a significant water chemistry factor that plays a major role in
metal ion adsorption.56,57 Herein, this effect has been
investigated in the adsorption studies of SiNPz-Py over
the pH range of 1.0–7.0 (Figure 5). Indeed, a significant effect on the sorption of
Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) was observed with the increase
of pH. At acidic pH, the active binding sites are protonated by H+ which causes the electrostatic repulsion between positively
charged hosts and guests,58,59 where the N and O atoms
of the ligand undergo a protonation reaction giving a positive charge
to the surface of the material SiNPz-Py. With an increase
of the pH, the effect of H+ competition decreases due to
the deprotonation of the N and O atoms of the ligand, which makes
the binding sites more accessible to metal ions. However, at pH >
7, the adsorption is limited because of hydrolysis and precipitation
of metal ions. Therefore, the optimum pH was found at 6 and the maximum
adsorption capacity was found as 110.84 mg g–1 for
Pb(II).

Figure 5 Effect of pH on the adsorption of metal ions by SiNPz-Py, at optimum concentrations, t = 60 min at 25 °C,
Δqe = 0.3 (mg g–1).

2.4.2 Influence
of Contact Time
The contact
time is also an important factor for metal adsorption. Experiments
were performed using 10 mg of SiNPz-Py and 10 mL of solution
at an optimum initial concentration of metal ions, 25 °C and
pH 6.0. The contact time was spread over 0–35 min (Figure 6). The metal adsorption
capacity increases with increasing time and remained constant after
about 20 min. The sorption of Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) was
very rapid and reached more than 90% of adsorption in the first 5
min. The rapid kinetics of metal ions presumably originates from the
fast coordination between different metal ions and active binding
donor atom sites.60,61 This result is very promising
in the application of materials in the efficiency and economy cleanup
of heavy metals from wastewater.

for the adsorption of
Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) ions by SiNPz-Py.
Adsorption dose: V = 10 mL, m =
10 mg of adsorbent, pH = 6, optimum concentration (110 ppm in each
case), and at 25 °C, Δqe =
0.3 (mg g–1).

2.4.3 Kinetic Modeling
Kinetic parameters
have important roles in understanding the adsorption process. Two
pseudo-first and second-order models were investigated to reveal the
adsorption kinetic mechanism. These two kinetic models were employed
in nonlinear forms as61−63 Pseudo-first-order:
1   Pseudo-second-order:
2  Where qe (mg g–1) and qt (mg g–1) are the adsorption abilities
at equilibrium and at time t (min), respectively. k1 (min–1) is a pseudo-first-order
sorption rate constant and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) is the rate constant of
pseudo-second-order adsorption.

A
nonlinear fitting of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models
vs time dependence are shown in Figure 6. Table 2 gives the kinetic parameters for the two models. The best fits were
obtained with the pseudo-second-order mode, which is suitable for
the adsorption phenomena and chemisorption mechanism.64,65

2.4.4 Influence
of Initial Concentration
The concentration of metal ions
has an important role in breaking
the strength of the mass transfer resistance between the aqueous and
solid phases.66 The impact of initial concentration
was investigated using the batch method over the concentration range
of 5–300 mg L–1. Figure 7 shows clearly that the adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent increased with increasing the initial metal ion concentration.
At lower initial metal ion concentrations, the ratio of active sites,
at the surface of the adsorbent, to the initial concentration of metal
ions was higher, so adsorption became independent of initial concentrations.67

Zn(II),
Cu(II), and Cd(II) on SiNPz-Py. Adsorption dose: 10 mg, V = 10 mL, 25 °C and pH = 6 for Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II),
and Cd(II) ions, Δqe = 0.3 (mg g–1).

2.4.5 Adsorption
Isotherms
Adsorption
isotherm models could be used to describe the interaction between
metal ions and SiNPz-Py. In this work, experiments were
conducted by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The corresponding
nonlinear equations are expressed as follows68−70 Langmuir:
3   Freundlich:
4  Where qe (mg g–1) is
the equilibrium adsorption capacity, Ce (mg L–1) is the ion concentration
in the solution, q (mg L–1) is
the saturated adsorption capacity, KL (mg1–1/n L1/n g–1) and KF (mg1–1/n L1/n g–1) are the Langmuir constant and the Freundlich
constant, respectively, and 1/n is the heterogeneity
factor.

Adsorption isotherms of Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), and
Cd(II) are displayed in Figure 7 and Table 3. These results are in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm
model, suggesting the uniform monolayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption
capacity qe was 117.64, 90.09, 63.69,
and 63.69 mg g–1 for Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and
Cd(II), respectively.

2.4.6 Thermodynamic Analysis
Thermodynamic
parameters describe the relationship between metal ions adsorption
and temperature. Therefore, adsorption thermodynamics of Pb(II), Zn(II),
Cu(II), and Cd(II) ions onto the adsorbent were investigated at three
different temperatures (299.15, 309.15, and 319.15 K). For this purpose,
10 mg of SiNPz-Py was added separately to 10 mL of aqueous
solution under optimum conditions. The different parameters of Gibb’s
free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°)
were calculated by using the following equations71 5   6   7   8  Where Kd is the
distribution constant, Kc is the equilibrium
constant, C0 (mg L–1) is the initial concentration adsorption capacity of metal ion, Ce (mg L–1) is the equilibrium
concentration of metal ion, R (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) is the gas constant, ΔG° is the change in Gibbs free energy (kJ mol–1), ΔH° is the change in enthalpy (kJ
mol–1), ΔS° is the change
in entropy (J K–1 mol–1), and T (K) is the absolute temperature. The ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated from the
slope and intercept of the plot ln Kd vs 1/T.

The results are given in Figure 8 and in Table 4. Indeed, the negative
values of ΔG° at the three temperatures
demonstrated the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process,
whereas the positive values of ΔH° indicated
the endothermic nature of the process, in other words, favorable adsorption
will occur at high temperatures.71 Meanwhile,
the positive ΔS° values highlight the
increase in the randomness at the solid–solution interface.

of temperature on the sorption of metal ions onto SiNPz-Py (contact time 60 min, pH = 6, adsorption dose: V = 10 mL, m = 10 mg of SiNPz-Py at
optimum concentrations).

2.4.7 Selectivity
of SiNPz-Py
To study
the selective sorption of Pb(II) from a solution containing not only
Pb(II) but also Zn(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) ions (150 mg L–1 for each, pH = 6.0), SiNPz-Py (10 mg) was added to
a solution containing metal ions (10 mL) at room temperature. After
1 h of shaking, the concentration of each metal ions was measured
by atomic absorption. The results are shown in Figure 9, where SiNPz-Py demonstrates
remarkably an excellent adsorption capacity toward Pb(II) than the
other three ions. However, the extraction seems to decrease weakly
compared to the value obtained in the absence of mixture metal ions.
This can be explained by the cavities created by the ligand, the ionic
radius of lead, and the shape and coordination geometry of the Pb(II)
ions. Yet, this adsorbent has good adsorption properties and high
capacity toward Pb(II). This gives hope for the use of SiNPz-Py in the removal of lead from water.

2.4.8 Effect of Co-existing Ions
Adsorption
of Pb(II) was examined in the presence of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions that are commonly abundant
in natural water samples. The study was examined under optimum conditions
as described above. The alkali metals and the Pb(II) ion concentrations
used are given in Table 5 as well as the results of recoveries. These results indicate that SiNPz-Py has high selectivity toward Pb(II) and can thus be
applied to the real sample that contains diverse ions.

2.4.9 Regeneration and Reuse of SiNPz-Py
The
regeneration and reuse of SiNPz-Py were studied
to evaluate the economic benefit. In this study, 10 mg of SiNPz-Py was used for the adsorption of the Pb(II) metal ion from 10 mL of
solution (150 mg L–1, 25 °C, 1 h, pH = 6).
After adsorption, Pb(II)-loaded SiNPz-Py was desorbed
by using 5–6 mL of HCl (6 N) per gram of adsorbent stirred
at room temperature for 2 h. Then, Pb(II) released in the solution
was determined by atomic absorption measurements. The results, gathered
in Table 6, demonstrate
that the adsorption abilities presented slight fluctuations during
five successive adsorption–desorption cycles. As a result, SiNPz-Py has maintained high structural stability after each
regeneration cycle. On the basis of the experimental approach, SiNPz-Py has a good adsorption performance after regeneration
and can potentially be applied as an effective adsorbent for the cleanup
of Pb(II) ions from water.

2.4.10 Adsorption
of the Pb(II) Mechanism
The silica surface has a ligand loaded
with active sites (O, N) as
well as the latter are reinforced by the mesomeric effect. Therefore,
oxygen and nitrogen atoms have a high affinity for metal ions.72−75 On the basis of the HSAB (hard-soft acid-base) theory, Pb(II) has
been classified as an intermediate ion. There is therefore an affinity
with two types of intermediates and hard ligands that contain nitrogen
atoms of oxygen atoms.76 Automatically,
the Pb(II) ions will be chelated by the nitrogen atoms of the imine
function and heterocycles (pyrazole and pyridine) and oxygen of the
alcohol group. Therefore, we can conclude that chelating interactions
are the main driving force behind the adsorption of Pb(II) on SiNPz-Py.

2.4.11 Pb(II) Adsorption from
Real Water Samples
The applicability of SiNPz-Py in the adsorption of
heavy metal ions from natural river water was also investigated by
using the batch method. Indeed, 10 mg of adsorbent was mixed with
10 mL of river water and 0.5 mL of HNO3 at room temperature
for 60 min. River water was selected from two spots in Morocco, that
is, (i) Ghiss (Al Hoceima) and (ii) Touissit-bou-bekker (Jerada-Oujda).
As the selected real water samples did not contain Pb(II) that is
the best metal to be removed by the SiNPz-Py adsorbent,
the samples have been doped with 5 and 10 mg L–1 of Pb(II), respectively, and the removal efficiency and recovery
of the adsorbent was investigated under optimal conditions. As can
be seen in Table 7,
the recovery of Pb(II) was over 98%, which indicated that the adsorbent
has outstanding potential for removing Pb(II) from natural water.

2.4.12 Comparison with Recent
Adsorbents
Table 8 shows the
maximum sorption capacity of the SiNPz-Py of 110.84 mg
g–1 which is sensibly higher compared to several
other adsorbents recently reported in the literature for the removal
of Pb(II). In particular, our group has recently described a hybrid
material operating for Pb(II) with 80.14 mg g–1.77 Furthermore, our hybrid material performances
were also compared to the known commercialized activated carbons and
showed a very superior affinity. It can be concluded that SiNPz-Py is an effective and efficient low-cost sorbent material for the
removal of lead from water and may be considered a viable alternative
to commercial adsorbents.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the fabrication
of a novel hybrid
material based on new supramolecular pyridylpyrazole-β-ketoenol
receptor covalently incorporated into the silica surface. The material
was found to be chemically and mechanically solid, recyclable without
loss of its adsorption capacity, highly selective, and more efficient
than several other recently reported adsorbents. Interestingly, the
material exhibited rapid substantial uptake and excellent selectivity
with the order of Pb(II) > Zn(II) > Cu(II) > Cd(II). The SiNPz-Py adsorbent could remove Pb(II), in an individual mode,
110 mg g–1, and in a competitive mode, 78 mg g–1. The hybrid material had a high tolerance limit in
alkali metal
solutions and in natural water with recoveries of more than 98%. Adsorption
properties suggested a monolayer adsorption, chemisorption binding
mechanism, and an endothermic and spontaneous process. All these results
suggest that SiNPz-Py is a potential material for the
selective removal of Pb(II) from real aqueous solutions, a subject
of enormous importance in environmental issues.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All reagents
(Aldrich, purity 99.5%) were of analytical grade. Initial silica gel
(60 Å, 70–230 mesh) (E. Merch) was activated at 120 °C
for 24 h. The quantification of metal ions in aqueous solutions was
determined by atomic absorption (Spectra Varian A.A. 400 spectrophotometer).
The surfaces were characterized by CHN analyses (Microanalysis Center
Service, CNRS), FTIR (PerkinElmer System 2000), SEM (FEI-Quanta 200),
TGA (PerkinElmer Diamond), 13C NMR-solid state (CP MAX
CXP 300 MHz), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) (Thermoquest
Sorpsomatic 1990 analyzer).

4.2 Synthesis of (Z)-1-(1,5-Dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
(L1)
1-(Pyridine-2-yl)ethanone (11.89
mmol) and a suspension of sodium (17.39 mmol) in dry toluene (25 mL)
were stirred at 0 °C for 1 h. Then, pyrazole-3-carboxylate (11.89
mmol) in toluene (10 mL) was added. The reaction was kept under stirring
for 3 days at room temperature. The resulting solid was treated thoroughly
with toluene and neutralized with acetic acid to pH = 5.5. The mixture
was extracted with dichloromethane twice and the organic phases were
combined and dried. After removing the organic solvent, the resulting
residue was chromatographed using silica gel (CH2Cl2/MeOH 9:1). The residue was recrystallized with hot methanol
to give a single crystal, which was characterized by X-ray crystallography.

4.3 Synthesis of 3-Aminopropyl-silica
(SiNH2)
The SiNH2 precursor
was
prepared according to our adapted literature procedure.72 Typically, activated silica (25 g) in dry toluene
(200 mL) was stirred under reflux and an inert atmosphere for 2 h.
Then, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (10 mL) was added dropwise and
the refluxing was maintained for 24 h. The precipitate was filtered,
treated with organic solvents, and dried at 60 °C for 24 °C.

4.4 Synthesis of SiNPz-Py Adsorbent
A
solution of (Z)-1-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (3.5 g)
in dry methanol (30 mL) was added to a suspension of SiNH2 (5 g) in methanol (15 mL). The mixture was refluxed
for 4 h under an inert atmosphere. Then, the solid was separated,
washed by Soxhlet extraction and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.5 Single Crystal X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction
data were collected on a colorless plate crystal
of (Z)-1-(1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(pyridine-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
having approximate dimensions of 0.400 × 0.200 × 0.100 mm3 and mounted on a glass fiber. All measurements were made
on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID II diffractometer using graphite monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71075 Å). The structure was
solved by direct methods49 and expanded
using Fourier techniques. All calculations were performed using the
Crystal Structure88 crystallographic software
package except for refinement, which was performed using the SHELXL97
program.89 Nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were refined using the riding model.
The details of crystal parameters, data collection, and refinement
are listed in Table 1. A summary of selected bond lengths [Å] and angles [°]
are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

4.6 Batch Experiments
The applicability
of SiNPz-Py for the sorption of Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II),
and Cd(II) was investigated as follows.

4.6.1 Effect
of pH
SiNPz-Py (10 mg) was added into a conical
flask containing 10 mL of Pb(II)
141 mg L–1, Cu(II) 141 mg L–1,
Zn(II) 100 mg L–1, and Cd(II) 80 mg L–1 solutions and then the mixture was adjusted to a predefined pH with
NaOH or HCl solution (0.1 M). Adsorption experiments were carried
out in metal ion solutions with an initial pH ranging from 1.0 to
7.0 at 298 K for 60 min.

4.6.2 Effect of Initial Concentration
The concentration effects (5–300 mg L–1)
were studied using SiNPz-Py (10 mg) in solutions of Pb(II)
141 mg L–1, Cu(II) 141 mg L–1,
Zn(II) 100 mg L–1, and Cd(II) 80 mg L–1 (10 mL, pH 6.0) at 298 K for 60 min.

4.6.3 Effect
of Contact Time
Experiments
on effects of contact time (0–35 min) were examined using SiNPz-Py (10 mg) in solutions of Pb(II) 141 mg L–1, Cu(II) 141 mg L–1, Zn(II) 100 mg L–1, and Cd(II) 80 mg L–1 (10 mL, pH 6.0) at 298 K.

4.6.4 Effect of Temperature
Experiments
on the effects of temperatures (298, 308, and 318 K) were conducted
using SiNPz-Py (10 mg) in solutions of Pb(II) 141 mg
L–1, Cu(II) 141 mg L–1, Zn(II)
100 mg L–1, and Cd(II) 80 mg L–1 (10 mL, pH 6.0) for 60 min.

The following equation90 was used to determine the adsorption capacity 9  where qM (mg g–1) is the adsorption
capacity, Ce (mg L–1) and C0 (mg L–1) are
the equilibrium and initial concentration
of solution respectively, V (L) is the total volume
of the sample, and W (g) is the mass of SiNPz-Py. The average data from duplicate analyses were determined for each
sample.
