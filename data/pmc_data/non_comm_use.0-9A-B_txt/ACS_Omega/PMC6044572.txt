We report the first antimicrobial
study of transparent and robust
Cu-doped ZnO coatings that displayed potent antimicrobial activity
that resulted in bacterial (Escherichia coli) reduction below detection limits within 6 h of illumination via
a white light source that is found in hospital environments. The same
bacterial reduction rate was observed even under darkness for 4.0
atom % Cu-doped ZnO films thus providing an efficient 24 h disinfection.
All films were produced via a novel, inexpensive, and easily scalable
route and were also thoroughly analyzed for their material properties.

Introduction
Nosocomial infections
are a major concern for hospitals and healthcare
institutions globally.1−3 Many of these infections are caused by multidrug-resistant
strains of bacteria. If current trends persist, by 2050 antimicrobial
drug resistance would lead to a loss of 10 million lives every year,
with a reduction in the world gross domestic product of 2–3.5%,
which translates to a cost of up to U.S. $100 trillion.4,5 In hospital environments, which are the epicenter of a majority
of these antimicrobial drug-resistant infections, 80% of infections
are due to contaminated touch surfaces.6−8 Disinfection of such
surfaces is key to the fight against spread of antimicrobial bacteria.

Antimicrobial surfaces and coatings are widely used and usually
consist of metal, metal oxides, or polymers doped with organic antibacterial
compounds, such as methylene blue.9−11 These coatings, when
applied to high-contact touch surfaces in healthcare environments,
are proving to be effective in the fight against hospital-acquired
infections.

Zinc oxide is an inexpensive semiconducting material
extensively
used in the optoelectronic industry due to its wide band gap (3.3
eV at room temperature) and high electrical conductivity. Recently,
it has found use as an antimicrobial agent and has seen application
in the lining of food packaging to reduce spoilage.12 The mechanism for the activity is complex and not fully
understood, but it is thought to be through various paths, including
the uptake of Zn2+ ions (released into the surrounding
environment from the metal oxide surface) into cells. Zn2+ is an essential ion for many microorganisms due to its involvement
in various cellular reactions, but at concentrations above 10–7 mol L–1 it becomes cytotoxic.13−16 Another process is that it induces the formation of powerful oxidizing
agents (such as hydrogen peroxide) within bacteria cells that can
cause cell damage.12 Further still, another
action of antimicrobial activity of ZnO arises from its photosensitive
properties. Upon irradiation by UV light with energy above 3.3 eV
(sunlight and fluorescent light sources commonly found indoors emit
light ca. 4% in the UV wavelengths, and some of this UV light will
have energy above 3.3 eV), ZnO oxidizes and reduces water and oxygen
(respectively) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS).12,17 These species can then cause damage to an organism’s cell
membrane, DNA, and protein through Fenton type reactions, which result
in cell death.18−23 Some believe this oxidative stress to be the primary mode of antibacterial
activity of most bactericidal metal oxides.24−27

Copper, a well-known antimicrobial
agent, is thought to show action
against bacterium via Fenton type reactions.28−32 Although a powerful and effective antimicrobial agent,
copper is expensive and so can have high costs when required to coat
high-contact surfaces that often have large areas. Furthermore, unlike
ZnO that is transparent, in the thin-film form, Cu, Cu2O, and CuO are not transparent but either opaque or colored. This
can lead to esthetic issues when it comes to real world, nonlaboratory
applications.

However, the use of copper as a dopant in a ZnO
matrix may potentially
circumvent the two aforementioned issues while enhancing the antimicrobial
properties of ZnO. The use of Cu-doped ZnO would allow the films to
remain transparent in the visible spectrum and provide a cheap (as
only a small quantity of Cu is used) and mechanically robust solution
while allowing attack of the bacterium using both Cu and Zn.

In this article, we report for the first time, the antimicrobial
activity of Cu-doped ZnO thin films. Although Cu-doped ZnO thin films
have been reported before, their functional testing has been limited
to applications, such as photocatalysis, ferromagnetics, and optoelectronics.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous papers have examined the
antimicrobial properties of Cu-doped ZnO in the thin-film form. Cu-doped
ZnO has been investigated as an antimicrobial agent in the nanoparticulate
and bulk powder variant against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria.33 Although nanoparticulate ZnOs
(and metals/metal oxides in general) show superior activity against
bacteria compared with bulk powders or thin films due to the larger
surface area (and hence higher contact with the bacteria), they are
difficult to handle in nonlaboratory situations when not immobilized.
When immobilized in, for example, polymers, they evidently lose some
of their active surface area and thus their efficiency advantage.
Thin films of ZnO are easy to handle and hard wearing, with almost
no hazards to human health that are associated with loose nanoparticles.

Also, in this article, we show the novel use of aerosol-assisted
chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) for the synthesis of the Cu-doped
films. AACVD is a simple solution-based atmospheric pressure film
growth technique that allows for easy scale up. In AACVD, the precursors
need not be volatile, as they are simply dissolved in a suitable solvent
and transferred to the deposition chamber as an aerosol mist via a
carrier gas (see the Supporting Information).34,35 Films produced via AACVD are of high quality
and have been used in many applications.36−39 The pure and Cu-doped films produced
were tested for their material properties and tested against Escherichia coli for their antimicrobial functionality
under both illuminated and dark conditions. The results showed potent
antibacterial activity under both conditions.

Results and Discussion
Pure and Cu-doped thin films of ZnO were deposited on glass substrates
from methanol solutions of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and differing molar concentrations of Cu(OAc)2·H2O at 350 °C using AACVD on glass substrates. The films
were highly transparent in the visible region with a slight green
coloration only at high (4.0 atom %) Cu dopant concentrations (see
the Supporting Information). The films
were also well adhered to the substrate, passing the Scotch tape and
scratch tests involving pencils of various hardness.40 Films were also stable when exposed to solvents such as
methanol, toluene, and water. Only weak acid was able to remove the
coatings from the substrates.

Material Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) showed the films to be phase pure ZnO in the Wurtzite crystal
structure (Figure 1a). Peaks at 31.9, 34.8, 36.7, 48.0, 57.2, and 63.5° 2θ
values corresponding to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103)
reflections, respectively, were observed. The broad nature of the
peaks suggests the films have poor crystallinity, primarily due to
the relatively low deposition temperature. Interestingly, the 4% Cu-doped
sample was relatively higher in crystallinity as evident from the
narrower nature of the peaks. Furthermore, for this film, the peak
positions were shifted to higher 2θ values, indicating a possible
contraction of the ZnO unit cell.

Figure 1 (a) PXRD and (b) UV–vis spectra
of the AACVD-deposited ZnO
and Cu-doped ZnO films on glass substrates.

UV–vis measurements were carried out on the pure and
Cu-doped
ZnO films to obtain transmittance and reflectance data (Figure 1b). All films had a high transmittance
in the visible and near-IR region with a sharp absorption edge in
the UV. With increasing Cu concentration, there was a decrease in
transmittance. At 4.0 atom % Cu loading, the films showed a broad
absorption peak at ca. 590 nm, leading to a green film.

The
optical band gap was calculated for all films by applying the
Tauc method to the UV–vis data, which showed no significant
change in the band gap (3.3 eV) at the Cu doping levels carried out
in this study. The reduction of the ZnO band gap when doping has only
been achieved at high doping concentrations in the literature.33 This is what was observed in this study too
(data not shown); however, at these concentrations the films have
a dark green/black coloration, which is not ideal esthetically as
coatings on, for example, door handles and keyboards for antimicrobial
applications.

The microstructure of the films was studied using
a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) (Figure 2). The pure ZnO film appears to have a faceted microstructure
not unlike previously deposited ZnO films via AACVD.41,42 Upon doping, especially at the higher Cu concentration regime, 3.2
and 4.0 atom % Cu, the morphology changes to a more globular structure
consisting of semicircular domes. The size of these domes, in general,
increases with increasing Cu concentration. For the 1.1 atom % Cu/ZnO
film, the diameter of the domes was between a range of 50 and 100
nm, whereas for the 3.2 and 4.0 atom % films, the range was between
100 and 600 nm. Overall, the films appear very compact and uniform,
with no cracks, voids, or pinholes.

Figure 2 SEM images for (a) pure ZnO and (b) 1.1,
(c) 3.2, and (d) 4.0 atom
% Cu-doped films grown via AACVD at 350 °C.

The films were also analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy
(EDS) to probe the elemental composition (see the Supporting Information). It showed the pure and doped ZnO
films to be free of any contaminants. The doped samples showed an
increase in Cu concentration with increasing AACVD precursor concentration.
Films made using 2, 4, and 8 mol % of Cu(OAc)2·H2O relative to Zn(OAc)2·2H2O showed
1.1, 3.2, and 4.0 atom % Cu compared with Zn in the films, respectively.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on the pure
and Cu-doped ZnO films to determine the oxidation state and chemical
composition at the surface (Figure 3). The core-level Zn 2p spectra showed peaks at 1021.5
eV for the 2p3/2 transition matching Zn in the +2 oxidation
state, as expected and concurring with the literature examples (Figure 3a). The Cu 2p spectra
showed a high signal to noise ratio due to the low dopant concentration
(Figure 3b), but there
is a single 2p3/2 peak at 933.0 eV suggesting the presence
of Cu in the 0 and/or +1 oxidation states. It is difficult to differentiate
between these two oxidation states of Cu from the XPS 2p transition
alone due to heavy peak overlap.43,44 Because of
the lack of a satellite peak around 940 eV that is normally associated
with Cu2+, it can be concluded that there is none or very
little Cu2+ present on the film surface. The ratio of Cu
to Zn at the surface of the films, as observed from the XPS peak area
analysis, increases with increasing dopant concentration and follows
the trend that was seen from EDX results (a bulk analysis technique).

Figure 3 Typical
core-level XPS spectra for the Cu-doped ZnO films grown
via AACVD at 350 °C consisting of (a) Zn 2p transitions composed
of a 2p3/2 peak at 1021.5 eV corresponding to Zn in the
+2 oxidation. (b) Cu 2p spectrum made up of a single symmetrical peak
at 933.0 eV in the 2p3/2 region matching Cu(0)/Cu(I). (c)
Valence band XPS spectrum with a magnified inset (d) for the 0–7.5
eV region for the 4.0 atom % Cu-doped ZnO sample.

Valence band XPS of the films can be separated and discussed
into
two distinct features (Figure 4c,d). First, the peak at 10 eV can be assigned to the Zn 3d
transition, whereas the second part between 7.5 and 0 eV, consisting
of a broad hump that has some fine structure (when magnified), is
comprised of two peaks at 6.5 and 4 eV. The small peak at 6.5 eV is
made up of Zn 4s and O 2p mixing contributions, and the peak at 6.5
eV is made up of only O 2p contributions.45 The position of the valence band maxima with respect to the Fermi
level, determined via a simple linear extrapolation of the leading
edge, is 2.5 eV for the 4.0 atom % Cu-doped ZnO film.

Cu-doped ZnO is able to disinfect contaminated surfaces. The differing
mechanisms of attack that destroy cell membranes, DNA, and proteins
of the microbes make the development of resistant strains virtually
impossible.

Antimicrobial Testing
The antimicrobial activity of
the undoped and Cu-doped ZnO films deposited on microscope glass slides
were determined using E. coli, a Gram-negative
bacterium that is commonly found in hospital environments (Figure 4). Samples were cut
into 1 × 1 cm2 sections and were covered with 25 μL
of bacterial suspension containing approximately 105 cfu.
For each experiment, a set of samples were illuminated with a white
light source (28 W), emitting an average light intensity of 3750 lx,
at a distance of 30 cm from the sample. In all experiments, a control
sample set was maintained in parallel and was stored under dark conditions
for the same exposure times. The fluorescent lamp used emits light
across the visible region of the spectrum, similar to those commonly
found in U.K. hospitals. After incubation for set times, bacteria
were recovered from the samples and the number of viable bacteria
remaining was determined. The results demonstrate that the films indeed
have antimicrobial activity against E. coli. Each bar represents the log10 of the mean number of
viable bacteria from the two experiments carried out at different
occasions, and error bars represent the calculated standard error.

After 3 h of exposure (Figure 4a), all of the films had a higher activity in the light
(L+) rather than the dark (L−), except for the 4.0 atom % Cu-doped
ZnO film that had the same reduction in bacterial numbers for both
conditions (1.3 log10). After 6 h of exposure (Figure 4b), all Cu-doped
ZnO films have significant reduction (P < 0.01)
in the number of viable bacteria to below the limit of detection in
the light. In darkness, there was only a small reduction in the counts
for both 1.1 and 3.2 atom % Cu-doped films. After 18 h of exposure
(Figure 4c), all samples
(apart from pure ZnO in darkness) were able to impart a reduction
in the number of viable bacteria to below the detection limits (P < 0.01).

The increased antimicrobial activity
of the Cu-doped films under
illumination compared to no illumination is most likely due to a multimechanistic
mode of attack. As shown in Figure 4d, it is possible that the light-activated Cu-doped
ZnO samples were able to disinfect via three routes: (1) oxidative
stress caused by ROS that are produced via reactions between photocatalytically
generated electrons/holes and H2O/O2, (2) the
Zn2+, Cu, Cu1+, and Cu2+ ions released
from the films that are cytotoxins to microbes above certain concentrations,
and (3) ROS species produced via Fenton type reactions that also cause
oxidative stress upon microbes. However, in darkness, route 1 is not
likely; therefore, only routes 2 and 3 could take place.

Cu-doped
samples performed better compared to pure ZnO under both
light and dark conditions. Under darkness, this is due to the antimicrobial
properties of Cu, but under light conditions, we believe it is due
to superior charge carrier lifetimes. One of the mechanisms of action
for ZnO, when illuminated with UV radiation above 3.3 eV, is via oxidative
stress caused by ROS. These species are produced via redox reactions
involving electrons (excited to the conduction band) and holes (remaining
in the valence band) on the surface of the ZnO films. The lower the
recombination rate the longer the lifetimes of the electron–hole
pairs and the higher the chance that these electrons and holes migrate
to the surface from the bulk to undergo the redox reactions. In Cu-doped
ZnO, the dopant states within the band structure act as trap sites
reducing recombination.46,47 This is common in many
metal-doped metal oxide systems and has been experimentally determined
using transient absorption spectroscopy.46 Hence, Cu-doped ZnO samples show increased antimicrobial activity
over that of pure ZnO samples under light conditions.

Water Contact
Angle Measurements
Evidence that the
films are photocatalytically active and route 1 (in Figure 4d) is able to proceed under
white light illumination over the time period of the antibacterial
testing was determined through water contact angle measurements (Figure 5). Photoinduced wettability
in ZnO occurs due to its photosensitivity.48,49 It takes place when ZnO is activated with light of energy above
3.3 eV, through the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes
from the bulk to the surface of the films, similar to route 1 shown
in Figure 4d. Some
of these holes are thought to react with lattice oxygen to generate
oxygen vacancies that are sites for hydroxyl adsorption, which increases
surface hydrophilicity and reduces the contact angle between the surface
and any water droplet.48,50

Figure 5 (a) Photographs of the change in water
contact angle on the surface
of the pure and Cu-doped ZnO films with white light irradiation time
and (b) the change in contact angle on the pure and Cu-doped films,
as a function of irradiation time.

The pure and Cu-doped films showed a decrease in the water
contact
angle with increasing irradiation time. As shown is Figure 5b, the greatest decrease was
observed for 4.0 atom %, followed by 3.2 atom %, 1.1 atom %, and pure
ZnO. This collaborates with what was seen in the antibacterial study
and the earlier mentioned idea that the presence of Cu in the ZnO
films enhances electron and hole lifetimes thus increasing the probability
of them reaching the surface of the films without recombination.

Conclusions
We demonstrate the novel use of AACVD for the
growth of pure ZnO
and Cu-doped ZnO thin films. The films were phase pure crystalline
matching the hexagonal unit cell of the wurtzite crystal structure.
XPS analysis showed Zn in the +2 oxidation state, whereas Cu was in
0 and/or +1 state on the surface. UV–vis spectroscopy shows
no significant decrease in the band gap with increasing Cu concentration
in the ZnO matrix, as previously seen for this level of Cu doping.
The increased antibacterial activity of the Cu-doped ZnO films compared
to that of the pure ZnO films was due to the multiple mechanisms of
attack allowed through oxidative stress caused by ROS and cytotoxicity
caused by the release of Zn2+, Cu0, Cu1+, and Cu2+ ions. The multiroute to disinfection also avoids
the possible risk of bacterial resistance development, a major concern
in world health care at present.

Experimental Section
All chemicals used in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co. and used as received. Deposition was on microscope slides
or 150 × 45 × 45 mm3 SiO2 (50 nm)-coated
float-glass (the SiO2 acts as a barrier layer preventing
diffusion of ions from within the glass into the deposition film),
which has been supplied by Pilkington NSG. Prior to use, the glass
substrates were cleaned with water, 2-propanol, and acetone.

Deposition
Procedure
Depositions were carried out under
N2 (BOC Ltd., 99.99% purity) flow. Zinc acetate dihydrate
(Zn(OAc)2·2H2O) (99%), copper dihydrate
(Cu(OAc)·2H2O) (99%), and methanol (99%) were purchased
from Sigma and used as received.

Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (2.28 mmol) was dissolved in MeOH (30 mL) in a glass bubbler.
The resulting solution was stirred for 10 min and then atomized using
a piezoelectric device (Johnson Matthey liquifog). For the Cu-doped
ZnO films, Cu(OAc)·2H2O (2, 4, and 8 mol % relative
to Zn(OAc)2·2H2O) was dissolved in methanol
(30 mL) in a separate glass bubbler, stirred for 10 min and then atomized.
The Zn precursor and Cu precursor flows were both kept at 0.5 L min–1, and the two aerosol flows were mixed at a Y junction
and delivered into the cold wall chemical vapor deposition reaction
chamber, as shown in the Supporting Information, using the N2 carrier gas.

The glass substrate
(4 mm float glass coated with a SiO2 barrier layer) temperature
was 350 °C, and the deposition time
was 60 min. After the deposition, the bubblers were closed and the
substrates were cooled under a flow of air. Only the pure ZnO film
was cooled under a N2 flow. The glass substrate was allowed
to cool with the graphite block to less than 100 °C before it
was removed. Coated substrates were handled and stored in air.

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was
carried out using a modified Bruker-Axs D8 diffractometer, with parallel
beam optics and a PSD LynxEye silicon strip detector. Unmonochromated
Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV with 30 mA emission current was
used. The incident beam angle was set at 0.5° and the 2θ
range of 10–65° was measured with a step size of 0.05°
at 1 s/step.

JEOL JSM-6301F field emission scanning electron
microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 5 keV was used for
SEM measurements.

Optical measurements were carried out using
a PerkinElmer Fourier
transform Lambda 950 spectrometer over a wavelength range of 300–2500
nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using
a Thermo
Scientific K-Alpha photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic
Al Kα radiation. Higher resolution scans were recorded for the
principal peaks of Cu(2p), Zn(2p), O(1s), and C(1s) at a pass energy
of 50 eV. The peaks were modeled using CasaXPS software, with binding
energies adjusted to adventitious carbon (284.5 eV) for charge correction.

Antimicrobial Activity
A procedure similar to that
of Hassan et al. was used for the antibacterial tastings.28

Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar (Oxoid;
Basingstoke, U.K.) was used to maintain E. coli strain (ATCC 25922) by weekly subculture. Ten milliliters of sterile
BHI broth (Oxoid; Basingstoke, U.K.) was inoculated by E. coli and incubated aerobically with shaking at
37 °C for 24 h. Bacteria from the overnight culture were collected
by centrifugation at 13 000g for 1 min. E. coli was then resuspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (Oxoid; Basingstoke, U.K.) and centrifuged at 13 000g for 1 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in PBS
prior to use. The cloudiness of the bacterial cell suspension was
measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer and was adjusted to an
optical density of approximately 105 cfu per 25 μL
aliquot.

The pure ZnO and Cu-doped ZnO slides were cut into
1 × 1 cm2 sections. A humidity chamber was used to
minimize drying
out of the suspensions. A 25 μL aliquot of the bacterial cell
suspension was spread on each slide and incubated at room temperature
(21 ± 2 °C) for the required exposure time. For each exposure
time (3, 6, and 18 h), triplicate samples were analyzed and uncoated
glass microscope slides were used as a control. The samples were then
irradiated for up to 18 h using a white light source (General Electric
28 W Watt Miser T5 2D compact fluorescent lamp) emitting an average
light intensity of 3750 lx at a distance of 30 cm from the samples.
A further set of samples (in triplicate) was maintained in the dark
for the duration of the irradiation time. Each exposure time was repeated
on two separate occasions

Postincubation, the slides were aseptically
transferred to a 225
μL PBS and vortexed for 30 s to release the bacteria into the
solution. Serial dilutions of the resulting bacterial suspensions
were prepared in PBS and 25 μL from each dilution was spread
on to MacConkey agar (Oxoid; Basingstoke, U.K.). Plates were incubated
aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. Postincubation, any bacterial
colonies formed were counted and the number of viable bacteria was
calculated. The Mann–Whitney U test was used
to determine the significance of the activity of zinc oxide or copper
zinc oxide slides compared with the glass control.

Water Contact
Angle Measurements
Water droplet contact
angles were measured using a First Ten Angstroms 1000 device, with
a side-mounted rapid fire camera fire-casting 3 μL droplets
from a fixed height onto the surface. Photoinduced wettability was
tested by placing the samples under a white light source for 0, 3,
6, and 18 h and then measuring the water contact angle by placing
a 3 μL droplet onto the surface of the films.
