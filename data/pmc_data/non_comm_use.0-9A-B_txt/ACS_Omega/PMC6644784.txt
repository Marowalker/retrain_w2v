Transition metal
dichalcogenides,
especially MoS2 and related MoS3, have attracted
attention as potential replacement of platinum for electrochemical
energy applications. These materials are typically treated before
the use in solvents. It is assumed that these solvents do not influence
follow-up electrochemistry. Here, we show that the oxygen reduction
overpotentials as well as inherent electrochemistry of MoS3 is dramatically influenced by solvents used, them being water, acetonitrile,
dimethylformamide, or ethanol. This has a profound impact on the interpretation
of the electrochemical studies and the choice of MoSx solvent treatment.

==== Body
Introduction
There has been a tremendous
amount of interest in transition metal
dichalcogenides in general and in MoS2 in particular. Layered
and two-dimensional MoS2 was deemed to replace Pt for industrially
important reaction; however, it was shown recently that amorphous
MoS2+x shows much higher catalytic activity.
Beyond crystalline MoS2, amorphous molybdenum sulfides
(a-MoSx, x ≥ 2)
have recently attracted much attention showing promising potential
as effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).1,2 Such molybdenum sulfides include MoS3 which has no crystalline
counterpart,3−5 and amorphous materials typically lack long-range
order but exhibit definite short-range arrangement.2 Synthesis of such materials in mild conditions
was reported, avoiding cost- and energy-intensive preparation methods.2 This is thus in line with the goal of applying
such materials for environmental applications such as for HER. Hu’s
group demonstrated that electropolymerization of [MoS4]2– and acidification of MoO3 and Na2S solutions can produce a-MoSx.6,7 Similarly, Tang et al. reported the deposition of a-MoS3 on CdSe-seeded CdS nanorods with a one-step thermal synthesis using
microwave heating to 90 °C for 50 min.8 A facile synthesis of the nanostructured a-MoSx catalyst at room temperature was later reported by Jaramillo’s
group. This method further allows the deposition of the as-prepared
material on to a wide range of substrates.9 Recent developments10−12 in catalyst design have hybrid structures dominating
this field.7,13−17 Some examples include a-MoSx on the N-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) forest hybrid which requires
only a low overpotential of 0.11 V, rivaling some of the best molybdenum
sulfide HER electrocatalysts to date;17 the use of nanoporous gold as a substrate for a-MoSx which is active for HER in both the acidic and neutral
medium;14 graphene-a-MoSx composite;16 the hybrid structure
of a-MoSx on the graphene-CNT (GCNT) as
a highly active HER catalyst;13 morphology
control such as the growth of MoSx on
graphene-protected three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam,18 and hollow prism structure of Co–MoS3.19 These catalyst designs are representative
of the current a-MoSx catalyst and have
commonly shown improved conductivity and hence faster electron transfer
rates which tackle the issue of slow electron transfer20 or increased surface area and hence greater
density of catalytic sites as reasons for enhanced HER performances.
Also, in recent years, detailed theoretical and experimental studies
to elucidate the structure and active sites have sprouted,21−25 with which older literatures can provide insightful knowledge about
the specific structures.3,4,26−30 Although the catalytic active sites of a-MoSx for HER is not yet well established or widely acknowledged
as of now, extensive efforts by various research groups will accelerate
our understanding and aid in the eventual design of a highly functional
catalyst.

Activation of the as-synthesized catalysts was commonly
reported
to be necessary for the transformation to the active species.7,9,13,23,31 Instead of looking at modifying synthetic
procedures or specific engineering of the catalyst, the impact of
four common solvents (acetonitrile, ACN; N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF; ethanol, EtOH, and water) as the
dispersion medium for MoS3 was explored for the activation
process. In this series of experiments, commercially available MoS3 was used. The duration after dispersion preparation was also
investigated. This is kept within a reasonable experimental timeframe,
as the focus of their report is to investigate the fundamental preparation
method of MoS3 dispersions for the investigation of electrochemical
measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was
also discussed in an attempt to explain the observations.

Results and Discussion
Reductive peak current was observed for MoSx in various solvents and of varying magnitude. It was also
reported by Vrubel and Hu9,13,22,23 that MoSx exhibits a reduction peak in the first scan, and it was postulated
by the same group that this is an activation of the MoSx precatalyst to the active form.7 MoSx is commonly activated
before any meaningful electrochemical measurements were taken. This
is so to first activate the catalyst to its active form and second
to ensure that it is stabilized before any subsequent measurements
were taken.9,31 What is of interest here is the
varying effects of various solvents on MoS3 electrochemical
reductive activation.

Electrochemical Study of MoS3/Solvents
Figure 1 shows the
detailed
comparison of the linear sweep voltammograms of MoS3 dispersed
in various solvents in the acidic electrolyte, within a fixed range
of current density. A quick visual scan of the different linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) plots gives the general conclusions that different
solvents indeed have an important role in this first reduction process.
This role is further enhanced by repeating the experiment after a
longer time period of 1.5 days and 2 weeks (the LSV after 1.5 days
are not shown). By “fresh”, we meant that the electrochemical
experiments were done on the same day as the preparation of the dispersions.
The bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was drop-casted with the aliquots
of the dispersion right after it was sonicated for 20 min (see procedure).
The duration from where the dispersions were first prepared showed
different electrochemical profiles (Figure 1). The following discussion will be focused
on the different solvents.

Figure 1 Linear scan voltammetric plots of MoS3 dispersed in
various solvents, namely, (a) ACN, (b) DMF, (c) EtOH, and (d) water
where the dispersions were (i) freshly prepared and (ii) prepared
after 2 weeks. Legend: “Solvent-2” refers to the second
polarization curve (lighter color). Conditions: 0.5 M H2SO4; scan rate: 2 mV s–1.

The first reductive sweep is required to activate
the catalyst
irrespective of the time duration (fresh to 2 weeks) for ACN, EtOH,
and water. When DMF was used as the solvent, differences were observed
with varying time periods. For DMF, the activation process is only
required for the freshly prepared dispersion (Figure 1b). Subsequently, such reductive peaks were
no longer observed for dispersion media that were prepared for a longer
period of time of 1.5 days and 2 weeks [see Figures S1 and 1b(ii)]. Because there seems
to be a change in the MoS3 species after the first reductive
sweep, “reduced-MoS3” will be used throughout
this text to refer to MoS3 after being subjected to one
reductive sweep. It seems to suggest that DMF itself is able to cause
a change in MoS3 even without the application of a reductive
potential and stabilizes this form likely to be the same as reduced-MoS3. Still, we do see an improvement in the form of lower overpotential
to achieve the required current density of −10 mA cm–2 for the second polarization, despite the change being small [Figure 1b(ii)]. When water
was used as the dispersion medium, the electrochemical profiles were
rather similar despite the time duration. The first polarization does
not cause any obvious reductive current (current density generally
less than |−10 mA cm–2|) within the 0–0.8
V versus RHE range as compared to MoS3 in ACN, DMF, or
EtOH. The presence of a broad prewave before a steeper increase in
current density occurring at ca. −0.9 V versus RHE was generally
observed. Subsequently, after the first polarization, the reduced-MoS3 was able to achieve a much larger current density at a lower
potential.

The experiments were again repeated at an extended
time period
of more than 1 month. A similar trend to the voltammograms as when
they were prepared after 1.5 days and 2 weeks was observed: the current
density has a steeper increase after the first reduction at a smaller
absolute potential. Because the LSV gave a similar trend, the dispersions
were deemed to be in a stable state after they were prepared for ∼1.5
days. It is noted that the recurrence of the reductive peak was observed
at ca. −0.5 V versus RHE but not for DMF. Even though the reductive
process was not fully removed after the first reductive sweep, bubbling
was observed at the working electrode generally at ca. −0.35
V versus RHE, signifying the onset of HER.

Figure 2 shows the
Tafel plot and the corresponding Tafel slope of the reduced-MoS3 after preparation for 2 weeks. “Reduced-MoS3” refers to MoS3 after being subjected to the one
reductive sweep. The observed Tafel slopes for reduced-MoS3 in the various solvents after preparation for 2 weeks, in this case,
are all under 85 mV dec–1 and are obtained from
the region (0.15–0.45 V vs RHE) close to the onset potential.
The similar Tafel slope achieved by the different dispersion hints
at similar reaction kinetics and the choice of solvent has minimal
impact on the electron transfer process. This Tafel slope, though
not exceptional, is significant when compared to bulk MoS2.32−34 As in this case, MoS3 is used as per commercial availability,
and no effort was made to enhance the material design. The lower Tafel
slope of MoS3 in general (compared to bulk MoS2) could also attribute to its amorphous nature.3,4 It
was discussed by Chia et al. that the electrochemical process can
result in the presence of a higher amorphous phase of the material.35 A detailed study by Li et al. exploring the
relationship between the crystallinity and Tafel slope also reported
lower Tafel slopes for the material with correspondingly lower crystallinity.25

Tafel slope
of the reduced-MoS3 from various solvents after preparation

The superior HER activity of a-MoSx (or MoS3) after activation has
been reported in the literatures.
This manuscript is not a replication to report the lower overpotential
that a-MoSx can achieve but instead, to
look into the different electrochemical responses (in the form of
the voltammograms) when the same material (MoS3) was dispersed
in different solvents, (ACN, DMF, EtOH, and water). What was discussed
previously with regards to the first polarization is exceptional,
especially when the choice of solvent for dispersion has always been
something more intuitive in many instances, especially in terms of
electrocatalytic analysis. Given the increasing attention in a-MoSx which includes MoS3, certain
differences across literatures were discovered. According to the pioneering
work of a-MoSx by Hu’s group, they
mentioned the need for reductive activation of the as-synthesized
material.6 Such reductive activation was
similarly reported by other groups.9,13,22,23 In coherence to our
finding that the use of DMF obsoletes the need for reductive activation
(after a short time frame of 1.5 days), several groups who did not
mention this activation process utilize DMF in their synthesis process.
Both Ge et al.14 and Chang et al.18 use DMF as a solvent for the synthesis of a-MoSx where MoSx on
nanoporous gold (MoS2.7@NPG) and MoSx on graphene-protected three-dimensional Ni foam were synthesized.
Luxa et al. dispersed the as-synthesised a-MoSx/graphene composite in DMF;16 similarly,
Latiff et al. also use DMF as a dispersion medium for the study which
involves MoS3.36 These aforementioned
literatures did not report any activation process and despite that,
the materials were also found to be highly catalytic for HER.

Reductive
Activation Process Evaluation through XPS
To elucidate the
structural differences, surface analysis with the
use of XPS was done. The XPS data from the powder MoS3 were
used as a reference for the fitting. The full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the same Mo 3d and S 2p species was fixed within ±0.3
eV to that of the reference (Figure 3). This procedure is similar to that of Vrubel and
Hu, who fixed the fwhm of the Mo and S species.31 The high-resolution spectra for Mo 3d and S 2p were measured
for the four solvents with the fresh and aged (2 weeks) dispersion,
before and after the first reductive sweep. Aged and “2 weeks”
samples are used interchangeably throughout the text.

Figure 3 High-resolution XPS spectra
of powder MoS3: [a(i)] Mo
3d and [a(ii)] S 2p. The powder MoS3 sample is used as
a reference for further deconvolution of the MoS3 dispersion
in various solvents. The binding energies are as follows: Mo4+ 3d5/2 (229.4 eV), Mo(A) 3d5/2 (231.1
eV), Mo6+ 3d5/2 (232.6 eV), S 2s (227.5 eV),
S(B) 2p3/2 (162.2 eV), and S(C) 2p3/2 (163.5 eV).

In the Mo 3d spectra of the powder MoS3, three
bonding
types of Mo (Figure 3) were fitted. Mo 3d5/2 with the highest binding energy
at ca. 232.6 eV was assigned to Mo6+. The lower binding
energy Mo4+ at ca. 229.4 eV corresponding to 3d5/2 as in MoS2 and the BE is similar to that of a-MoSx by Lu et al.,12 whereas Mo(A) with an intermediate binding energy between
the two oxidation states at ca. 231.1 eV which can either be Mo5+ or Mo4+ as in MoOxSy.13,37 The sulfur
spectra which contain S either as S22– or S2– are consistent with other reports on MoS3 and are markedly different from their MoS2 counterparts.
S(B) corresponding to the lower binding energy is representative
of terminal S22– or unsaturated S2–, whereas S(C) which have a higher binding
energy can be due to bridging S22– or
apical S2–.13,31

Figures 4–7 show the
fitted XPS spectra of the investigated samples. From the raw data
spectrum, it is identified that the lower energy peak of the doublet
in the Mo 3d spectra has higher intensity (or similar) to the higher
energy peak in the doublet after reduction. Before the application
of cathodic potentials, the lower energy peak of the doublet is commonly
observed to be of lower intensity. Some general trends were observed
across the samples in their XPS spectra. First, proportion of Mo4+ shows an increase, while Mo6+ decreases (Tables S1 and S2) after reduction. Next, the
proportion of S from the lower BE, S(B), generally increases
after reduction, though exceptions were seen for dispersions in water
(fresh) and in ACN (aged). Further inspection found a general trend
such that the ratio of S(B)/S(C) is approximately
1 after reduction.

The electrochemical processes
occurring during reductive activation
is not yet well understood, with varying viewpoints presented. Hu’s
group has previously attributed it to the reduction of disulfide ligands,
S22– to S2–, forming
the active catalyst.6 Tran and co-workers
proposed the formation of unsaturated Mo4+ sites during
reduction as the catalytic sites for HER for their prepared a-MoSx.23 Tang et al.
also observed a photoreduction of their MoS3-coated CdS
nanorods from Mo5+ to Mo4+ prior to photocatalysis
of hydrogen reduction, and the authors deemed the active species to
be an undercoordinated species.8 The greater
density of coordinatively unsaturated Mo and/or S sites in a-MoSx is often cited as the reason for enhanced
HER activity.2,7,11

The presence of Mo6+ is commonly attributed to be due
to the contamination by the presence of surface oxides in the form
of MoO3.9,31 The decrease in Mo6+ composition is likely to be due to the dissolution of the surface
oxides in the electrolyte during the first reductive sweep. Benck
et al. have found that the proportion of Mo6+ decreases
after the catalyst film is rested in water or sulfuric acid even without
the application of cathodic potentials.9 Though intuitive, the decrease in Mo6+ and a corresponding
increase in Mo4+ proportion after reduction cannot be correlated
simply. Instead, the composition of Mo 3d was normalized to look just
at Mo4+ and Mo(A) as Mo6+ is contributed
by the oxide contaminant and not part of the molybdenum sulfide component
(Tables 1 and 2). The structure of MoS3 is still debatable
with literatures citing either Mo5+(S22–)0.5(S2–)2 or Mo4+(S22–)(S2–).4,24,26,28,30,38 From Tables 1 and 2, it is apparent that the increase in Mo4+ is likely
due to a reduction of Mo(A). Less informative is the S
spectra as it is hard to distinguish terminal S22– from unsaturated S2– at the lower binding energy
and between the bridging S22– and apical
S2- at the higher BE because of their similar BE.18,22,39 Their contribution to either
S(B) or S(C) would very much depend on the actual
chemical environment. From the XPS data, a general increase in S(B) proportion is observed albeit with some exceptions. These
exceptions lead us to agree with Pham et al. who caution against the
exclusive use of the S 2p XPS spectra for the prediction of catalytic
activity for MoS3.13 Again,
Li and co-workers have previously degraded MoS3 by 50 cycles
to MoS2, but they observed that the catalytic activity
was maintained even when the proportion of S at the higher BE was
almost nonexistent.25

a The samples were taken from the
dispersions prepared for 2 weeks (aged). “Not red”—as-prepared

Herein, the increase in Mo4+ which is attributed to
the reduction of Mo(A) and a general increase in the S(B) proportion is observed. It is inferred that the reductive
activation could be attributed to the reduction of Mo(A) to Mo4+ as concluded from the XPS data. Instead of looking
at the change in proportion of S composition, further inspection leads
to the identification that the ratio of S(B)/S(C) after reduction approaches close to 1 with the exception of reduced-MoS3–DMF (fresh), which has equally good catalytic activity.
It is postulated that the reduced-MoS3 species in this
study is likely to be constituted mainly of Mo4+ with S(B)/S(C) ≈ 1. The general increase in S(B) coincides with the likelihood of a great proportion of
terminal S22–. This terminal S22– has been discussed to be involved in the catalytic
process21,25 for HER, though opposing viewpoints exist.11,18,22 In this current study, a general
increase in S(B) is in tune with the involvement of terminal
S22–.

The different solvents gave
similar results where a significantly
higher proportion of Mo4+ is observed with an S(B)/S(C) ratio close to 1 after reduction. Even without the
application of cathodic potentials, MoS3–DMF (aged)
composition is highly similar to that of reduced-MoS3–DMF.
The application of cathodic potentials did not lead to a significant
change. This is in agreement with the LSV where reductive activation
was no longer required for MoS3 when it was dispersed in
DMF for a longer time period.

Catalytic Efficiencies
of MoS3/Solvents for ORR
Most of the literatures
and efforts have been focused on MoS3 functionality as
an effective HER electrocatalyst, and much
less is known about its efficiency toward ORR. Similarly, a reductive
sweep was run as in the experiments for HER, but the electrolyte used
in this case was 0.1 M KOH. It is not surprising to note that a reductive
peak occurs at a more negative potential compared to the ORR catalyzed
by the bare GCE surface (Figure 9). This is likely to be due to the inherent electrochemical
reduction of MoS3 as observed for HER in pH 0. The recurrence
of the peaks even when the experiments were replicated in N2-saturated KOH further affirms this (Figure 8i). As noted in Figure 8i (N2-saturated KOH), all of the
second polarization curves show no obvious reduction peak. This would
have meant two things. First, the first sweep has successfully rendered
all reducible moieties reduced, and next, the reduced material is
not able to be reduced further within the potential range. This irreversibly
transformed the material after the applied cathodic potentials. Two
reduction peaks were observed for the modified GCE in air-saturated
KOH but not for N2-saturated KOH. These reduction peaks
are likely to be constituted of ORR (ca. −0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl)
and an inherent reduction of MoS3 (ca. −0.8 V vs
Ag/AgCl). The reductive peak at the more positive potential (ca. −0.5
V vs Ag/AgCl) is likely to be due to ORR as it is not present when
the electrolyte is nitrogen saturated, whereas the inherent reduction
peak persists at the more negative potential (ca. −0.8 V vs
Ag/AgCl). This can serve as an important identification that ORR occurs
even in the first polarization, before MoS3 is expected
to be reduced. From the various solvents, it is observed that MoS3 dispersed in EtOH shows the most obvious ORR reduction peak
in the first polarization, and its subsequent onset potential is the
most positive as compared to MoS3 dispersed in other solvents.
An in-depth analysis of the onset potential of the reduced-MoS3 material for ORR has shown no improvement from the bare GC
(Figure 9). As such, we find that MoS3 in this case
is not highly active as an electrocatalyst for ORR because no significant
enhancement in terms of onset potential is achieved with the reduced-MoS3-modified electrode surface as compared to the bare GCE. Hence,
effort was not taken to look into the aging effect of MoS3 when the electrolyte was of pH 13 (0.1 M KOH), the conditions used
for ORR. These experiments were conducted within 1 week of the preparation
of the dispersions to ensure that it has reached a stable state in
the particular solvent.

Heterogeneous Electron
Transfer at the MoS3/Solvent-Modified
GCE for the Ferro/Ferricyanide Redox Probe
The kobs0 is able
to give an indication of the practicality of the material for sensing
applications. A small peak separation is indicative of a faster heterogeneous
electron transfer (HET) rate and is favorable as it meant a lower
overpotential for the electrochemical process.40Figure 10 shows the cyclic voltammogram and the bar chart comparison of the
peak separation. The ferro-/ferricyanide redox probe is known to be
surface-sensitive41,42 and hence would allow us to evaluate
the observed HET rate, kobs0, of the prepared dispersions.

were drop-casted on the GCE are shown in (a,b); control experiments

at pH 7.2; scan rate: 100 mV s–1. Error bars correspond
to standard deviations based on triplicate measurements. Only the
second scans were used for data processing. (The materials were not
electrochemically modified before the measurements).

The as-prepared dispersions were not electrochemically
reduced
before taking the measurement. Instead, the potential window of the
cyclic voltammetry (CV) run is kept small and within −0.4 to
0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl, and the second scan was taken for the processing
of data. Comparing with the control run, where solvents were drop-casted
without any materials on the bare GCE, we see obvious contrast despite
the use of the same redox couple. In the control experiments, DMF
resulted in the largest peak separation, and it is hence expected
to give the largest peak separation for MoS3 dispersed
in DMF as well. However, MoS3 dispersed in DMF does not
give a peak separation much larger than that of the bare GCE. Instead,
MoS3 dispersed in ACN or water gave a larger peak separation,
even larger than the bare GCE. Thus, kobs0 is much slower
for the surface modified with MoS3–ACN and MoS3–water, giving kobs0 of 9.18 × 10–4 and 7.04 × 10–4 cm s–1,
respectively. A timed-study was not conducted for this redox couple;
the results were collected within 1 week after the dispersions were
prepared. Hence, the timed-electrochemical study of the various dispersions
in the preceding section could have explained these differences. Previously,
it was observed that MoS3 dispersed in DMF gave a highly
active electrocatalyst for HER after the dispersion was prepared for
1.5 days or more even without any activation process. Thus, this same
material (reduced-MoS3 in DMF) could have been both the
active catalyst for HER and also the material with an enhanced HET
rate as seen by the smaller peak separation. Indeed, following the
same argument, MoS3 in EtOH should have its peak separation
similar to the dispersions in ACN or water. The enhanced catalytic
efficiency of MoS3 dispersed in EtOH is inferred to be
due to the use of the solvent, which improved the catalytic efficiency
on the bare GCE surface as observed in the control experiment. EtOH
was previously studied as a dispersion medium for functionalized graphene
sheets which the authors reported a larger porosity factor with a
smaller peak to peak separation for EtOH suspension but not the deionized
water suspension.43 In addition, a higher
voltammetric response was recorded for multiwalled CNTs dispersed
in EtOH drop-casted on the GCE.44 Although
the interaction between the solvent and the material would definitely
differ for different materials, this serves as supporting evidence
where solvents can result in enhancement in certain responses rather
than the intrinsic property of the material. The enhanced HET rate
was achieved when MoS3 was dispersed in DMF, where DMF
itself is shown to detrimentally affect the sensitivity of the modified-GCE.
Thus, this illustrates the possibility of reduced-MoS3 to
be highly functional not just for HER but also in terms of HET for
this redox probe. This is in direct contrast to TMDs which have consistently
shown to have a slower HET rate as compared to the bare GCE, especially
when in bulk form.40,45−47

Conclusions
The different solvents used in this case have seen to have varying
impacts on the reductive activation of the MoS3 used in
this study. DMF has shown to be able to preferentially stabilize the
species after one reductive voltammetric sweep, which we name reduced-MoS3, during a longer time period even without the application
of any reductive potential. The proposed composition of the reduced-MoS3 in this study is mainly Mo4+, with an S(B)/S(C) ratio close to 1 through XPS analysis. MoS3 dispersed in DMF (even without application of reductive potential
but prepared for more than a day) has shown to exhibit a much faster kobs0 despite the fact that the blank-DMF solvent (no MoS3)
can detrimentally affect kobs0 on the bare GCE. Thus, future applications
in sensing can be envisaged for reduced-MoS3 materials
with its faster kobs0. Different solvents have profound influence
on catalytic performance of MoSx for HER, which has strong implications
for energy storage field.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
molybdenum sulfide (MoS3)
used is commercially available as molybdenum (VI) sulfide dihydrate,
obtained from Alfa Aesar (Germany). ACN (high-performance liquid chromatography/spectro)
was obtained from Fulltime; EtOH is of analytical reagent grade, obtained
from Fisher Scientific UK; N,N-DMF
of purity ≥99.8% was obtained from Merck Specialities; Milli-Q
water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was used.

Procedures
MoS3 was prepared in suspensions
of a concentration of 1 mg mL–1 in ultrapure water,
whereas for organic solvents (ACN, DMF, and EtOH) with a higher concentration
of 5 mg mL–1 was used. The suspensions were sonicated
for 20 min to ensure that they are well dispersed. The materials were
then immobilized on the GCE (3 mm diameter) by transferring a 5 μL
of the suspended MoS3 in distilled water (1 mg mL–1), whereas 1 μL of the suspended MoS3 in other organic
solvents (5 mg mL–1) was transferred on the electrode
surface by drop-casting with subsequent drying of the solvent. This
ensured that the catalyst loading was kept constant at 70.7 μg
cm–2 per electrode. All voltammetry experiments
were repeated three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results
with random electrodes. Results of the electrochemical measurements,
which were conducted right after 20 min of sonication, were presented
as “fresh”. The modified GCEs were first subjected to
the application of cathodic potentials from (+0.2 to −1.4 V
vs Ag/AgCl). The XPS spectra were calibrated to adventitious carbon
to 284.5 eV.

Equipment
A μAutolab type
III electrochemical
analyzer (Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) controlled using the
NOVA 1.10 software was used to conduct the CV and LSV measurements.
A standard three-electrode configuration consisting of the working
electrode, the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), and the platinum counter
electrode was used for all voltammetry experiments. Measurements were
performed relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. XPS was conducted
by utilizing a PHOIBOS 100 spectrometer with a Mg Kα radiation
source (SPECS, Germany) at 1254 eV.

Electrochemical Measurements
LSV was conducted in 0.5
M H2SO4 with a low scan rate of 2 mV s–1, whereas for measurements in 0.1 M KOH a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 was used. CV measurements were performed in 50 mM
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.2 as the supporting electrolyte
for 10 mM using the ferro-/ferricyanide redox probe at a fixed scan
rate of 100 mV s–1, taking only the second scan
for data processing. The potentials versus RHE is calculated based
on the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + EAg/AgCl0 where EAg/AgCl is the measured potential and EAg/AgCl0 = 0.235 V which is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (1 M
KCl) at 25 °C.
