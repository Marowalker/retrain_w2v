Small,
“doll”-shaped tetracyanocyclopentadienide
bearing a 1,3-dioxane acetal “head” and cyano “hands”
and “feet” was synthesized. Its pyridinium salt, which
was named NanoGoblin, exhibited catalytic activity in the methanolysis
of acetals, as demonstrated by the reaction with NanoKid in methanol-d4, where the acetal head of NanoKid was converted
to a deuterated dimethyl acetal moiety.

Introduction
Tetra- and pentacyanocyclopentadienides
are conjugate bases of
superacids and are stabilized by both the aromaticity of the cyclopentadienide
ring and the inductive and mesomeric effects of cyano groups.1,2 Indeed, these anions are primarily characterized by their C5 symmetrical structure derived from the pentagonal
cyclopentadienide ring and the linear cyano groups. In addition, these
peripheral cyano groups can coordinate with metals through σ-bonding
because of the negative charge transfer from the cyclopentadienide
ring to the cyano group.3,4 For example, Wright
reported that sodium pentacyanocyclopentadienide forms fullerene-like
metal–organic frameworks in which the ligand coordinates to
six Na+ cations through all five C≡N groups.5 More recently, this salt was found to be a potent
open-channel blocker of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor.6 Following these discoveries, the interest toward
the chemistry of functionalized cyclopentadienide derivatives has
increased.7,8 Indeed, we recently developed an efficient
synthetic method for the preparation of tetracyanocyclopentadienides
from tetracyanothiophene and a range of sulfones9 and discovered that the sodium salts of tetracyanocyclopentadienides
catalyze hydrolysis reactions in biphasic systems.10 We also succeeded in the observation of rotamers around
the CAr–O bond and the measurement of rotational
barriers using 3,3′-disubstituted BINOL (1,1′-bi-2-naphthol)
esters of (tetracyanocyclopentadienyl)carboxylic acid.11

During the course of our studies on tetracyanocyclopentadienides,
we employed the acetalization of aldehyde 1(9) with 1,3-propanediol to protect the aldehyde
as the cyclic acetal-substituted tetracyanocyclopentadienide 2 (Scheme 1). Following the successful synthesis of 2, we attempted
to exchange the sodium counter cation for a pyridinium cation using
pyridine hydrochloride. However, hydrolysis of the 1,3-dioxane ring
of 2 occurred to afford the pyridinium salt of aldehyde 3 instead of the desired product 4. This unexpected
transformation likely occurred through an attack by pyridinium chloride
at the acetal head of molecular doll 2, which bears cyano
“hands” and “feet.” Indeed, this observation
reminded us of a pioneering piece of work on anthropomorphic molecules
by Tour and Chanteau,12,13 in which they reported the creation
of a novel class of 2 nm tall molecules that resembled the human figure
and were named NanoPutians. In this context, NanoKid (5), which bears a simple dioxolane “head,” can serve
as a precursor to other NanoPutians (Figure 1). Such compounds are of particular interest
because these endearing molecular shapes14−24 attract the interest of young students who are entering into the
world of organic chemistry. However, despite such interest, reactions
between anthropomorphic molecules have received little attention to
date. We therefore envisaged that the hydrolysis of NanoKid (5) using a pyridinium salt of acetal-substituted tetracyanocyclopentadienide
could be envisaged as an “attack” on NanoKid (5) by a small doll-shaped molecule bearing a pyridinium weapon.
We therefore designed the pyridinium salt of tetracyano(1,3-dioxan-5-yl)cyclopentadienide 6 (NanoGoblin), which contains a methylene acetal group rather
than an arylidene acetal moiety (cf, NanoKid), thus making it more
resistant to acid hydrolysis. We herein report the synthesis of NanoGoblin
(6) and its reaction with NanoKid (5) to
ultimately provide an intriguing topic for young students studying
organic chemistry.

Figure 1 Structures of NanoGoblin (6) and NanoKid
(5).

Scheme 1 Attempted Synthesis
of Pyridinium Cyclic Acetal 4
Results and Discussion
The synthesis of NanoGoblin
(6) began with the construction
of a 1,3-dioxane head unit through the acetalization of triol 7 with methylal (Scheme 2).25 The resulting alcohol 8 was then converted to iodide 9, and the subsequent
treatment of 9 with CF3SO2Na in
toluene at 100 °C in the presence of 15-crown-5 afforded trifluoromethyl
sulfone 10. Higher reaction temperatures and the replacement
of toluene with dimethylformamide (DMF) decreased the yield of 10. Following the successful preparation of 10, construction of the tetracyanocyclopentadienide body was attempted,
a process which required significant optimization of the reaction
conditions, because the original conditions, where sulfone 10 was treated with NaH and tetracyanothiophene (11) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF),5 provided the desired
tetracyano(1,3-dioxan-5-yl)cyclopentadienide (12, sodium
form) in a poor 22% yield. Thus, after extensive screening of various
additives [DMF, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), and 15-crown-5], solvents
(THF and dimethyl sulfoxide), and bases (LiHMDS, n-BuLi, NaH, NaHMDS, KHMDS, and KOt-Bu), we found
that the addition of HMPA under the original reaction conditions significantly
promoted the formation of the desired product. However, the removal
of HMPA from the product was challenging because of the strong coordination
of HMPA to the sodium cation, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. As
such, the desired product was isolated as its silver salt 12, following the cation exchange with AgNO3 (52% overall
yield).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Methylene Acetal 12
Subsequently, methylene acetal 12 was armed with various
aminium “weapons.” More specifically, the pyridinium,
imidazolium, ammonium, and triethylammonium cations 6 and 13–15 were prepared in good yields (70–95%)
by the treatment of silver salt 12 with the corresponding
amine hydrochlorides in methanol at room temperature (rt), followed
by the removal of the precipitated AgCl (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Attachment of Various Aminium “Weapons”
to Methylene
Acetal 12
These aminium salts
were selected
as the chemical structures of pyridinium, imidazolium, ammonium, and
triethylammonium salts could be imagined to take the form of a club,
a gun, a ninja star, and a hook nail, respectively. Comparisons of
the aminium structures and these weapon figures are shown in Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information.

The catalytic activities of the synthesized aminium
salts 6 and 13–15 in the methanolysis
of acetal 16 were then investigated in methanol-d4 (CD3OD), as outlined in Table 1. As indicated, in
the presence of pyridinium
salt 6, which has the strongest acidity of the four cations
examined, methanolysis was completed (97% yield) within 6 h at rt.
In addition, imidazolium 13 and ammonium 14 promoted methanolysis to give the desired product 17 in yields of 28 and 65%, respectively, after 24 h. By contrast,
triethylammonium 15, which exhibited the weakest acidity
of the four cations, did not catalyze the methanolysis reaction. These
results therefore confirmed that the pyridinium salt of NanoGoblin
(6) should serve as a successful “weapon”
against NanoKid (5).

a Yields
determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 1,2-dichloromethane
as an internal standard.

Thus, the methanolysis of NanoKid (5) with NanoGoblin
(6) in methanol-d4 was attempted
(Scheme 4), and the
transformation was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2). As indicated,
NanoKid (5) remained intact for 5 min after commencing
the reaction. However, after 8 h, the 1H NMR signals corresponding
to 5 had decreased in intensity by approximately one-third,
and the formation of new signals was observed at 5.55 and 5.70 ppm,
corresponding to the acetal protons of dimethyl acetal 18 and cross-acetal 19, respectively. After 46 h, all
signals corresponding to both NanoKid (5) and intermediary
cross-acetal 19 had disappeared, with the formation of
dimethyl acetal 18 being confirmed in 89% yield. Interestingly,
the signals at 4.75 and 5.02 ppm corresponding to the methylenedioxy
protons of 6 remained unchanged during the experiment,
thereby indicating that NanoGoblin (6) could successfully
“defeat” NanoKid (5) whilst remaining chemically
unchanged itself (i.e., in a catalytic manner).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully synthesized
the pyridinium salt
of 1,3-dioxan-5-yl-substituted tetracyanocyclopentadienide (NanoGoblin)
and demonstrated its catalytic activity in the methanolysis of acetals.
More specifically, the doll-shaped NanoGoblin catalyzed the methanolysis
of the acetal “head” of NanoKid in methanol-d4 to yield the corresponding dimethyl acetal
without exhibiting any structural changes (i.e., catalytic “destruction”).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a “battle”
(i.e., reaction) between NanoPutians. We expect that this study may
have educational potential to attract the interest of young organic
chemistry students and in particular ignite their interest in the
areas of acetal chemistry and acid/base concepts.

Experimental
Section
General Experimental Methods
All air- and moisture-sensitive
reactions were carried out in dry solvents under an argon atmosphere.
In all cases, rt ranged from 26 to 28 °C. Flash chromatography
was carried out using silica gel 60 (spherical, neutral, 40–50
μm) or diol silica gel (spherical, 40–75 μm). Melting
points are uncorrected. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million (ppm) relative to the solvent signals (1.94 ppm for CD3CN and 3.31 ppm for CD3OD) or internal TMS (0.00
ppm for CDCl3) for the 1H NMR spectra and to
the solvent signals (1.39 ppm for CD3CN and 77.0 ppm for
CDCl3) for the 13C NMR spectra. Coupling constants
(J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Data are reported
as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet,
t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, and br = broad), integration,
and coupling constant. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded
on magnetic sector electron impact (EI) or magnetic sector fast atom
bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometers.

Cyclic Acetal 2
To a solution of aldehyde 1 (11.2 mg, 0.052
mmol) in 1,3-propanediol (394 mg, 5.18 mmol,
100 equiv) was added TsOH·H2O (9.5 mg, 0.052 mmol),
and the mixture was stirred at rt for 2 h. After this time, the reaction
was quenched using a saturated NaHCO3 solution, and the
resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under
reduced pressure. Flash chromatography using diol silica (40% CH3CN in CH2Cl2) afforded acetal 2 (11.3 mg, 79%) as a yellow solid. mp 320–330 °C

To a solution of
cyclic acetal 2 (11 mg, 0.041 mmol) in a mixture of CH2Cl2 (3.5 mL) and water (3 mL) was added pyridinium
hydrochloride (24 mg, 0.22 mmol), and the resulting mixture was stirred
at rt for 5 min. After this time, the organic and aqueous layers were
separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure
to afford pyridinium aldehyde 3 as a yellow solid (4.2
mg, 37%) which was of sufficient purity for spectroscopic analysis.

Alcohol 8
Alcohol 8 was prepared
according to Gensini’s method with a number of modifications.12 More specifically, to a solution of 2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol
(7) (5.00 g, 47.1 mmol), LiBr (818 mg, 9.42 mmol), and p-TsOH·H2O (896 mg, 4.72 mmol, 0.1 equiv)
in a mixture of CHCl3 (40 mL) and H2O (4.5 mL)
were added CH3OH (15.1 mL, 471 mmol, 10.0 equiv) and methylal
(17.0 mL, 189 mmol, 4.0 equiv). The resulting mixture was heated at
65 °C for 26 h; after this time, additional LiBr (818 mg, 9.42
mmol), p-TsOH·H2O (896 mg, 4.72 mmol),
and methylal (9.5 mL, 106 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was
then heated for a further 46 h at 65 °C, cooled to rt, and concentrated
to a volume of ∼10 mL under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography
using silica gel (60–100% Et2O in n-hexane) afforded acetal alcohol 8 (3.30 g, 59%). The O-MOM product (1.77 g) was also obtained as a by-product,
and so removal of the O-MOM group was carried out
as follows. To a solution of the O-MOM product (1.77
g, 10.8 mmol), LiBr (188 mg, 2.17 mmol), and p-TsOH·H2O (206 mg, 1.08 mmol, 0.1 equiv) in CHCl3 (9.2
mL) was added CH3OH (3.5 mL, 108 mmol, 10 equiv). The resulting
mixture was stirred under reflux for 24 h, then cooled to rt, and
concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography using silica
gel (60–100% Et2O in n-hexane)
afforded the desired acetal alcohol 8 (704 mg, 15%).

and PPh3 (17.8 g, 67.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) in benzene (80
mL) was added iodine (17.2 g, 67.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv). After stirring
the reaction mixture at rt for 0.5 h, the reaction was quenched with
a 10 wt % aqueous solution of Na2S2O3. The resulting mixture was extracted with Et2O, and the
organic phase was washed with water, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography
using silica gel (70% CH2Cl2 in n-hexane) afforded iodide 9 (5.48 g, 71%) as colorless

Na2S2O3 (10 mL) was added to the
resulting orange solution, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc.
The organic phase was then washed with brine, dried over anhydrous

General Procedure for NMR
Monitoring of the Methanolysis of 16 to 17 in CD3OD (Table 1, Entry 1)
A solution
of acetal 16 (27 mg, 0.18 mmol) and 1,2-dichloroethane
(as the internal standard, 1 μL) in CD3OD (0.70 mL)
was prepared in an NMR tube. After the addition of pyridinium salt 6 (5.5 mg, 0.017 mmol, 0.1 equiv), the progress of the reaction
was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The yield of the
product was determined to be 97% based on the integration of the peak
areas of dimethyl acetal 17 (5.73 ppm) and 1,2-dichloromethane
(3.77 ppm) after 6 h.

For the reaction where 6 was
employed (Table 1,
entry 1), the reaction was quenched with Et3N after the
completion of methanolysis. The resulting mixture was concentrated
and purified by flash chromatography using silica gel (20% EtOAc in n-hexane) to afford acetal 17 (23 mg, 84% isolated
yield) as a colorless oil. IR (film): 3088, 3064, 3033, 2878, 2245,
2212, 2129, 1355, 1131 cm–1; 1H NMR (600
MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.46–7.44 (m, 2H), 7.38–7.31
(m, 3H), 5.39 (s, 1H); 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ 138.1, 128.4, 128.2, 126.6, 103.0, 51.8 (septet, JCD = 21.5 Hz); HRMS (EI) m/z: [M]+ calcd for C9H6D3O2, 158.1214; found, 158.1205.

NMR Monitoring
of Methanolysis (“Attack”) of NanoKid
(5) by NanoGoblin (6) in CD3OD
A solution of NanoKid (5) (7.6 mg, 0.014 mmol) and
benzene (as the internal standard, 1 μL) in CD3OD
(0.75 mL) was prepared in an NMR tube. After the addition of NanoGoblin
(6) (3.6 mg, 0.011 mmol), the progress of the reaction
was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. After 46 h, the yield
of 18 was determined to be 89% by the integration of
the dimethyl acetal signal (5.54 ppm) relative to that of the internal
standard (benzene, 7.33 ppm).

Isolation of Dimethyl Acetal 18
To a solution
of NanoKid (5) (3.0 mg, 0.0056 mmol) in CD3OD (1.0 mL) was added NanoGoblin (6) (5.0 mg, 0.015
mmol), and the resulting mixture was stirred at rt for 12 h. After
this time, the reaction was quenched with Et3N and the
mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography
using silica gel (5% Et2O in n-hexane)
afforded 18 (2.6 mg, 89%) as a colorless oil. IR (film):
2967, 2930, 2869, 2231, 2219, 2065, 1580, 1362, 1267 cm–1; 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.59 (s,
1H), 7.51 (s, 1H), 7.45 (d, 2H, J = 1.5 Hz), 7.37
(t, 1H, J = 1.5 Hz), 5.55 (s, 1H), 2.37 (t, 4H, J = 7.0 Hz), 1.62 (qt, 4H, J = 7.3, 7.0
Hz), 1.35 (s, 9H), 1.34 (s, 9H), 1.04 (t, 6H, J =
7.3 Hz); 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ 139.1,
135.3, 134.2, 133.6, 129.6, 125.7, 125.1, 124.5, 123.5, 122.0, 104.7,
104.2, 102.2, 91.9, 91.3, 88.4, 79.4, 77.8, 75.9, 53.6 (septet, JCD = 21.5 Hz), 31.0, 30.9, 28.3 (×2), 22.1,
21.3, 13.5; HRMS (FAB) m/z: [M +
