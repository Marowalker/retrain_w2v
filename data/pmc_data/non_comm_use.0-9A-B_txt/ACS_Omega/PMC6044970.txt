A novel metal foam-based Fenton-like
process for wastewater treatment
is illustrated in this study. In the system, H2O2 was generated in situ by taking advantage of O2 in air,
as metal could activate dissolved O2 to produce •O2– and then generate H2O2. Furthermore, metal foam can enhance the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling, which eventually improved the efficiency of the
Fenton process. The performance of the novel Fenton-like process was
assessed by methyl blue (MB), and 94% MB removal could be achieved
within 5 min in nickel (Ni) foam system. The degradation of MB in
this study was based on both •OH and •O2– radicals, where •O2– radical served as the precursor
to generate •OH for MB degradation through a Fenton
process. The pH value of 3 with the initial Fe2+ concentration
of 0.25 mM was found to be the optimum condition for the Fenton-like
process. This study provides a general and new strategy for efficient
wastewater treatment just using aeration and metal foams (such as
Ni, Al, and Cu foams), which also offers a good alternative for rational
design and application of traditional Fenton process.

1 Introduction
Advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs), which can generate powerful
chemical oxidants, have been widely used to degrade recalcitrant pollutants.1,2 Fenton process is one of the most efficient AOPs that has been widely
used in wastewater treatment because it can produce a nonselective
strong oxidant, hydroxyl radical (•OH),3,4 to oxidize contaminants. Most of the organic pollutants can be easily
oxidized by •OH to be smaller organics or entirely
mineralized to be carbon dioxide and water.5 However, in traditional Fenton system, the storage and transportation
of H2O2 combined with a large amount of iron
sludge6 as the byproduct may restrict its
wider application.7 To prevent the accumulation
and precipitation of soluble iron, heterogeneous catalysts with low
Fe dissolution, such as iron oxides,8,9 and iron-immobilized
clays10 are widely used in heterogeneous
Fenton systems to replace the homogeneous Fenton system.

In
addition, electro-Fenton (E-Fenton) process has also drawn much
attention due to its continuous H2O2 generation
on anodal material and Fe2+ regeneration by direct cathodic
reaction.11 The E-Fenton system can continuously
produce H2O2 through the oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR);12 subsequently, the generated H2O2 can react with dissolved Fe2+ to
produce highly reactive •OH. Therefore, the key
issues in Fenton system lie in the production of H2O2 and the reduction of Fe3+. In E-Fenton system,
the efficient cathodic material should possess high electrical conductivity,
large surface area with good adsorption ability, and excellent chemical
stability to generate a large amount of H2O2.13 Various electrocatalysts, such as
carbon nanotubes,14,15 graphene,16,17 transition-metal oxides,7,18 have been investigated
to promote the ORR activity and current efficiency for H2O2 generation.19

To date,
numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the traditional
Fenton process. However, the addition of H2O2 is an inevitable part for homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton systems,
which complicates the process. Although E-Fenton can generate H2O2 in situ, the supply of current or voltage is
indispensable for all E-Fenton processes. Therefore, a more convenient
and efficient Fenton system is worth investigating.

In this
study, a novel Fenton-like system is developed by taking
advantage of O2 and metal foam under acidic condition with
Fe2+ as the catalyst. This process is performed under the
condition of aeration, during which metal foams could activate O2 to produce •O2–, which could then react with H+ to produce H2O2. Subsequently, a Fenton process involving Fe2+ and H2O2 can take place to produce highly
reactive •OH. With the assistance of metal foams,
such as Ni foam, Fe3+ can be reduced into Fe2+ to react with H2O2 again. Therefore, this
cycling can effectively and continuously promote the production of •OH for pollutant removal. Methyl blue (MB) was selected
as a model pollutant to evaluate the efficiency of this system with
different metal foams. Four kinds of metal foams (nickel, aluminum,
copper, and titanium) were studied to illustrate the reaction pathway.
The results revealed that Ni foam had the best efficiency, Al and
Cu foams came next, and Ti foam had little contribution to MB degradation
due to its inertness to H2O2 production and
Fe3+ reduction. The effects of various parameters, such
as pH value and the concentration of Fe2+, were also studied
and discussed. The whole process was supplied with neither current
nor voltage, and the addition of H2O2 was also
unnecessary in this effective system.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Ni-Foam-Based Fenton-Like
System
Figure 1 shows the
degradation of MB under various reaction scenarios. The relationship
among Ni, air, and Fe2+ on the degradation of MB was systematically
studied. The presence of single component, such as Ni, air, or Fe2+, had little effects on MB degradation. In the presence of
Ni foam, the addition of Fe2+ into the solution resulted
in the efficient degradation of MB. However, the combination of Ni/air
or Fe2+/air had little effect on MB degradation. Furthermore,
in the presence of both Ni foam and Fe2+, the removal efficiency
of MB increased dramatically as a consequence of air bubbling.

Figure 1 (a) Degradation
of MB under various reaction scenarios. (b) Degradation
of MB by supplying different gases (reaction conditions: initial pH
= 3, [Fe2+] = 0.5 mM, [MB] = 20 mg L–1).

According to the phenomenon mentioned
above, we can conclude that
both Ni foam and Fe2+ were essential factors for MB degradation,
and bubbling air would promote the removal efficiency of MB. To elucidate
the role of air on MB degradation process, experiments were conducted
by supplying different gases (air, oxygen, or nitrogen) to saturate
MB solution. As shown in Figure 1b, faster removal of MB was observed with higher oxygen
concentration (bubbling oxygen), whereas in the absence of oxygen
(bubbling nitrogen), the removal of MB was strongly inhibited. Therefore,
dissolved O2 was also essential for the degradation process.

It is likely that the above phenomenon could be attributed to the
following Fenton-like reaction pathway. First, nickel foam played
an important role to react with dissolved O2 to produce •O2–20−23 through eq 1 and then •O2– can react with H+ to produce H2O224,25 through eq 2. Then, Fe2+ acted as the catalyst
and initiated the decomposition of H2O2 to generate
the highly reactive •OH to degrade MB, which can
be described as follows26−29 1   2   3  In the meantime, on the basis of the standard
electrode potentials of Ni2+/Ni and Fe3+/Fe2+ pairs (eqs 4 and 5), Ni foam could promote the cycling
of Fe3+/Fe2+ through eq 6. As a result, Fe2+ in this system
can react with H2O2 continuously to generate •OH for MB degradation. 4   5   6  On the basis of the above reaction
pathway
and the phenomenon observed in Figure 1b, it is clear that pure oxygen can accelerate the
generation of •OH to attack MB. Nevertheless, employing
air was effective and more economical than employing pure O2. Therefore, air bubbling was employed throughout the rest of the
study.

To prove the reaction pathway proposed above, it is instrumental
to measure the concentrations of H2O2 and Ni2+ in the process. Figure 2a shows the accumulation of H2O2 in the presence of Ni foam with continuous air bubbling. It is clear
that H2O2 was generated likely through eqs 1 and 2. In the absence of MB, the concentration of H2O2 increased dramatically to about 7.5 mg L–1 in
30 min and then reached a plateau. Ni2+ and Fe2+ were also measured during the MB degradation process. With the increase
of reaction time, the concentration of Ni2+ had a similar
tendency to H2O2, which was in accordance with eqs 1 and 2. The Fe2+ concentration remained unchanged during MB
degradation (Figure 2c), which suggests the efficient Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling
promoted by Ni foam. This is a robust evidence to support the presence
of eq 6 in this system.
According to eq 6, Ni
foam could reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Therefore, it
is expected that the introduction of Fe3+ is also beneficial
for MB degradation. To investigate the effect of Fe3+,
0.25 mM Fe3+ was added into the system to degrade MB at
pH 3. Under the same conditions, although Fe3+ could contribute
to MB degradation, its efficiency was much lower than that of Fe2+. Figure 2d reveals that 56% of MB was degraded in 5 min with the addition
of Fe3+, whereas Fe2+ could facilitate 94% degradation
of MB. The difference between Fe2+ and Fe3+ was
due to the fact that Fe2+ could be oxidized by H2O2 immediately to produce •OH for MB
degradation. However, Fe3+ had to be reduced by Ni foam
to generate Fe2+ first and then •OH can
be produced via a Fenton reaction. Therefore, Fe2+ was
a superior catalyst to Fe3+ in the metal foam-based Fenton-like
system.

[Fe2+] = [Fe3+] = 0.25 mM).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that Ni foam
(Figure 3a) maintained
its
three-dimensional porous structure after the reaction (Figure S1), which is beneficial for the mass
transfer of air.22 However, its surface
morphology changed dramatically as a result of chemical reaction.
As demonstrated in Figure 3b,c, the original Ni foam featured smooth surface in both
microscale and nanoscale. On the contrary, there was distinct corrosion
on the surface of the used Ni foam (Figure 3d). The size of the defects on the surface
of the Ni foam ranges from nanometers to micrometers (Figure 3e,f) as a result of the chemical
reaction depicted in eqs 1–6. The defects on the surface of the
Ni foam also indicate that nickel was leached during the reaction,
which was in agreement with the increasing Ni2+ concentration
during the reaction (Figure 2b).

the reaction.

2.2 Quenching
of •OH and •O2– in the Fenton-Like
Process
To have a better understanding of the reaction pathway
during the Fenton-like process, 2-propanol was used as an efficient •OH scavenger,28,30 and p-benzoquinone as an •O2– scavenger.31,32 As demonstrated in Figure 4, the addition of both p-benzoquinone and 2-propanol could inhibit the degradation
of MB dramatically. When 1 mM p-benzoquinone or 2-propanol
was introduced, there was no obvious change of MB concentration in
the Ni foam/air/Fe2+ system for 60 min, indicating the
complete inhibition of the degradation process. This phenomenon suggests
that the degradation of MB in this system was based on both •OH and •O2– radicals.
Here, •O2– radical
likely served as the precursor to generate •OH for
MB degradation rather than as a direct oxidant, as shown in eqs 2 and 3. This is demonstrated by Figure 1a that the combination of Ni and air had little effect
on MB removal. In such case, •O2– and H2O2 were produced; however,
they did not have the capability to degrade MB. The introduction of
Fe2+ to initiate Fenton reaction was crucial for the fast
MB degradation. It is also evident that the quenching of •OH completely inhibited the degradation of MB (Figure 4b). We therefore conclude that •OH was the main radical that degraded MB in this system.

Figure 4 (a) Effect
of p-benzoquinone addition on the degradation
of MB. (b) Effect of 2-propanol addition on the degradation of MB
(reaction conditions: initial pH = 3, [Fe2+] = 0.25 mM,
[MB] = 20 mg L–1).

2.3 Effects of Fe2+ Concentration and
Initial pH on MB Degradation
Solution pH and concentration
of Fe2+ are known factors affecting the efficiency of Fenton
process.33Figure 5a reveals that initial pH value had a great
impact on the degradation of MB. The system reached the maximal MB
removal efficiency at pH 3. With the increase of pH, the MB removal
decreased, which was likely caused by the formation of Fe2+-based hydroxyl complexes under high pH value. Figure 5a also reveals that when the pH value lowered
to less than 3 the MB degradation efficiency decreased. This can be
attributed to the scavenging effect of •OH by H+.34 The MB removal underwent a
gradual acceleration when Fe2+ concentration increased
from 0.025 to 0.25 mM (Figure 5b). The increased degradation of MB was ascribed to the enhanced
H2O2 decomposition associated with the increase
of Fe2+. However, when Fe2+ concentration continued
to rise, the MB removal decreased. This is because excessive amount
of Fe2+ would consume •OH,33,35,36 which resulted in the formation
of Fe3+ and OH– and consequently iron
hydroxides, thus terminating the Fenton reaction (eq 7). Therefore, the optimal conditions
for this Fenton-like process are initial pH = 3 and Fe2+ concentration = 0.25 mM. 7

of initial pH on the degradation of MB in Ni foam system
([Fe2+] = 0.5 mM, [MB] = 20 mg L–1).
(b) Effect of initial Fe2+ concentration on the degradation
of MB in Ni foam system (initial pH = 3, [MB] = 20 mg L–1).

2.4 Comparison
of Ni Foam and Ni Plate
To illustrate the role of Ni foam
on MB degradation, Ni plate was
also employed as another Ni source for comparison. Ni foam resulted
in much faster MB degradation than Ni plate (Figure 6a). In Ni foam system, the MB removal reached
94% in 5 min; however, only less than 50% MB removal was achieved
in the Ni plate system. The superior efficiency of Ni foam likely
originated from its macroporous structure possessing more specific
surface area, which can provide more reactive sites for H2O2 production. Therefore, the employment of Ni foam is
another key factor to obtain high reaction efficiency. Figure 6b shows the degradation of
three other pollutions based on our proposed Fenton-like process.
It is obvious that the proposed Fenton-like process is suitable for
other pollutants (such as orange II, methyl orange, and phenol). The
results indicate that this process may be a general approach for wastewater
treatment.

of three other pollutants (orange II, methyl orange, and phenol) based
on the Fenton-like process (initial pH = 3, [Fe2+] = 0.25
mM, [MB] = 20 mg L–1).

2.5 Degradation of MB Based on Other Metal Foams
In the Fenton-like system discussed above, Ni foam played an important
role in degrading MB by facilitating effective •O2– production as well as Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling. Some other metals, such as Al and Cu, which
have similar properties as Ni, may also have the ability to activate
O2 and circulate Fe3+/Fe2+. We propose
that the Ni-foam-based Fenton-like process is a general approach to
produce •OH for pollutant degradation, which could
be applied to other metal foams. Figure 7a shows the removal of MB in Fenton-like
systems based on different metal foams. Three typical metals (Ni,
Al, and Cu) that could reduce Fe3+ were chosen; another
metal (Ti) that does not have the ability to reduce Fe3+ was also selected for comparison. It is obvious that Ni foam had
the best efficiency to degrade MB. The MB removal reached 94% in 30
min. MB removal by Al foam reached 88% in 60 min, whereas Cu foam
could remove 50% of MB. However, almost no MB removal was observed
for Ti foam. This phenomenon confirms that metals that have the ability
to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ can be employed in this
Fenton-like system, whereas other inactive metals (such as Ti) are
inefficient in this system.

Figure 7 (a) Degradation of MB based on various metal
foams (initial pH
= 3, [Fe2+] = 0.25 mM, [MB] = 20 mg L–1). (b) H2O2 generated by different metal foams
with air sparging (initial pH = 3).

Furthermore, the differences in MB removal for the above
metals
were in good accordance with their H2O2 production
capability. As demonstrated in Figure 7b, Ni foam exhibited the best H2O2 accumulation. For Al foam and Cu foam, H2O2 concentration could achieve 3.8 and 1.8 mg L–1, respectively. As a result, their corresponding MB degradation efficiency
fell far behind Ni foam. As a comparison, no H2O2 was detected in Ti foam system due to its inertness to oxygen.

The performance of different metal foams with same surface area
of 0.5 m2 is demonstrated in Figure S2. It is revealed that Ni foam still demonstrates the best
MB removal efficiency, Cu and Al foams come next, and Ti foam has
little efficiency. Furthermore, the differences in MB removal for
the above metals (based on surface areas) were also in good accordance
with their H2O2 production capability. It is
found that Ni foam has the best H2O2 production
efficiency (18.5 mg L–1 in 1 h). For Cu foam and
Al foam, H2O2 concentration could achieve 3.8
and 0.93 mg L–1 in 1 h, respectively. As a result,
their corresponding MB degradation efficiency fell far behind Ni foam.
On the contrary, no H2O2 was detected in the
Ti foam system due to its inertness to oxygen. This phenomenon is
in agreement with previous comparison based on the mass.

The
surface morphologies of the three metals before and after reaction
vividly reveal the occurrence of the Fenton-like reaction. As demonstrated
in Figure 8a,c, the
surfaces of the original Al and Cu foam are smooth without obvious
defects. However, after the Fenton-like process, their surfaces became
fairly rough with numerous nanosized defects. The dramatic changes
in the surface morphology were caused by the following two reasons.
First and foremost, metal foams were corroded by oxygen, which produced •O2– and then H2O2. Second, metal foams reacted with Fe3+ to
produce Fe2+, which activated H2O2 to produce highly oxidative •OH. On the contrary,
the surface of Ti foam remained smooth and untouched after the reaction,
as Ti was unreactive to either •O2– production or Fe3+ reduction.

images of Al (a, b), Cu (c, d), and Ti (e, f) foams
before (left) and after (right) the reaction.

In summary, the reaction pathways for the proposed Fenton-like
process are depicted in Scheme 1. Initially, metal foam (denoted M in Scheme 1) can activate the dissolved O2 in water to produce •O2–, which then reacts with H+ in the solution to produce
H2O2 in situ. The added Fe2+ reacts
with H2O2 to generate •OH
for MB degradation. In the meantime, metal foam plays another role
in reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. As a result of Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling, •OH will be continuously
produced by the above Fenton-like process for pollutant degradation.

Scheme 1 Reaction Pathway for the Metal Foam-Based Fenton-Like Reaction
3 Conclusions
In this study, a novel Fenton-like system was developed by introducing
aeration and metal foam under acidic condition. Metal (Ni, Al, and
Cu) foam plays dual roles in this process that it can not only activate
dissolved O2 to produce H2O2 but
also facilitate Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling for continuous
Fenton reaction. The production of both •O2– and •OH in this process was
demonstrated, whereas •O2– was the precursor for H2O2 production and •OH was responsible for MB removal. Nickel foam had
the best activity for H2O2 generation and MB
removal, whereas Ti had little contribution to the reaction due to
its inertness for O2 activation and Fe3+ reduction.
The optimum conditions for this Fenton-like process were determined
to be pH value = 3 and Fe2+ concentration = 0.25 mM, under
which 94% of MB can be removed in 5 min by employing Ni foam. The
novel Fenton-like system in this study would have good potential in
wastewater treatment due to its high efficiency and low cost.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
chemicals used in this
study were of analytical grade. Hydrogen peroxide, FeSO4·7H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, isopropanol, and p-benzoquinone were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Potassium titanyl
oxalate and methyl blue were purchased from Mclean. Nickel, aluminum,
copper, and titanium foams were obtained from Suzhou Jiashide Metal
Foam Co., Ltd., China. All of the chemicals were used without further
purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments.
Prior to the degradation experiment, metal foams were washed by 0.1
M HCl and deionized water to remove the oxides and grease on the surface.

4.2 MB Degradation and H2O2 Accumulation
MB solution (500 mg L–1)
was kept as a stock solution. MB solution used in the degradation
reaction was obtained by diluting from the stock solution. The degradation
of MB was conducted in a 250 mL beaker containing metal foam (2 cm
× 2 cm × 2 mm) and 200 mL of MB solution with an initial
concentration of 20 mg L–1. Prior to the Fenton-like
reaction, air was bubbled into the reactor for 30 min and then Fe2+ was added. H2O2 was generated in a
system containing metal foam and deionized water but without MB during
bubbling air. The initial pH was adjusted to the designated value
using 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH.

4.3 Characterization
The MB and H2O2 concentrations were measured
by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (TU1810, Universal Analysis, Beijing, China). H2O2 was determined using the potassium titanium
oxalate method at its maximum absorption wavelength of 400 nm. The
MB concentration was measured at its maximum absorption wavelength
of 664 nm. The standard curves of H2O2 and MB
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S3 and S4). The Ni2+ concentration was detected
by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer37 (TAS-990F, Universal Analysis, Beijing, China). The specific surface
area (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) was measured by nitrogen
adsorption/desorption (Micromeritics ASAP2020 instrument). SEM measurement
was performed on a Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscope.
