Ta5+-doped Bi2O3 solid solutions,
(Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20), were synthesized by a conventional solid-state
reaction method. The crystal structure, optical properties, and color
of the pigments were characterized. The (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.20) samples
were obtained in a single-phase form, and the crystal structure depended
on the Ta content; they were monoclinic α-phase (x = 0), tetragonal β-phase (x = 0.03, 0.04),
and cubic δ-phase (x = 0.20). Among them, (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 strongly
absorbed visible light at the wavelength shorter than 480 nm and exhibited
the most vivid orange color. The redness value (a*) was comparable to that of commercial orange pigments, and the
yellowness value (b*) was slightly larger. Although
it is necessary to improve chemical stability, the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment has potential
for an environmentally friendly inorganic orange pigment.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Inorganic pigments composed
of metal oxides are applied in a broad
range of fields, such as ceramics, glasses, plastics, and paints,
because they have high hiding power, thermal stability, and weather
resistance. In the case of inorganic orange pigments, cadmium orange
(CdS·CdSe) and molybdate orange (PbCrO4·PbMoO4·PbSO4) were conventionally used. However,
application of these orange pigments containing toxic elements, such
as Cd, Pb, Cr, has been forbidden or restricted, because they have
harmful effects on the human body and the environment. Therefore,
development of inorganic orange pigments without toxic elements is
required and several studies have been reported.1−10

Because of this situation, we focused on bismuth sesquioxide
(Bi2O3) because it has been confirmed as virtually
nontoxic in medical references.11−13 Bi2O3 has
several polymorphs, such as α-phase (monoclinic structure),
β-phase (tetragonal structure), γ-phase (body-centered
cubic structure), and δ-phase (cubic fluorite structure).14 The band structure of Bi2O3 is constituted by a valence band composed of a hybrid Bi 6s and
O 2p orbital and a conduction band of Bi 6p.15−19 A pale yellowish α phase stably exists at room
temperature and is stable up to 730 °C. At 730 °C and above,
the α phase is transferred to the orange δ phase. δ-Bi2O3 has been suggested as a good electrolyte material
for solid oxide fuel cells and gas sensors, because this compound
is stable at high temperatures and exhibits high oxide ion conductivity.14,20−24

When δ-Bi2O3 is cooled from a
high
temperature, a phase transition to the β phase takes place at
650 °C. Also, the metastable γ-Bi2O3 is formed below 650 °C on cooling δ-Bi2O3. The structure of β-Bi2O3 is
a fluorite-based structure, but 25% of the oxide anion is regularly
deficient.25 Although the β and δ
phases are unstainable at room temperature, they can be stabilized
at room temperature when other cations are introduced into the Bi3+ site to form solid solutions. In fact, niobium- and tantalum-doped
(Bi1–xMx)2O3+2x (M = Nb or Ta) solid
solutions adopt β phase and δ phase at room temperature,
respectively, to exhibit high oxide anion conductivity.20 Although Nb5+-doped Bi2O3 has been reported as an inorganic reddish-yellow pigment,26 there is no report on the color evaluation of
Ta5+-doped Bi2O3 as an inorganic
pigment.

In this study, therefore, Ta5+-doped Bi2O3 solid solutions, (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20), were
synthesized
by a conventional solid-state reaction and their color properties
were evaluated as environmentally friendly inorganic orange pigments.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Powder Diffraction
(XRD) and Field-Emission-Type
Scanning Electron Microscopic (FE-SEM) Image
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of
the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) samples. The XRD patterns of α-,
β-, and δ-Bi2O3 from the inorganic
crystal structure database are also shown in this figure as references.
The crystal structure depended on the Ta content in (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04,
0.20); the monoclinic α-Bi2O3 structure
(x = 0), the tetragonal β-Bi2O3 structure (x = 0.03, 0.04), and the cubic
δ-Bi2O3 structure (x =
0.20) were obtained in a single-phase form, respectively. However,
a mixture of multiple phases was observed in the samples with x = 0.02 and 0.10 because the Ta concentration is near the
boundary of the phase transition.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤
0.20) samples.

The lattice volumes of
tetragonal (Bi1–xTax)2O2+x (x = 0.03 and 0.04) and cubic (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 were calculated
from the XRD angles, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The lattice volumes of the
pure (Ta-free) tetragonal β-Bi2O3 and
cubic δ-Bi2O327 are also listed as references, where the numbers in parentheses
indicate standard deviation. The cell volumes of the tetragonal (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 and the
cubic (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 samples were smaller than those of the Ta-free tetragonal and cubic
Bi2O3, respectively. The lattice volumes decreased
with increasing the Ta5+ content, indicating that Bi3+ (ionic radius: 0.103 nm)28 ions
were partially substituted with Ta5+ (ionic radius: 0.078
nm)28 ions. The cell volume of the tetragonal
(Bi0.96Ta0.04)2O3.08 sample
was also smaller than that of the Ta-free tetragonal Bi2O3. However, the lattice volume of the tetragonal (Bi0.96Ta0.04)2O3.08 and (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 samples
was equal. These results indicate that the solubility limit of Ta5+ in the tetragonal β-phase was x =
0.03 for (Bi1–xTax)2O2+x.

FE-SEM images of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.20) samples obtained
in a single-phase form. Although aggregated coarse particles were
observed in all samples, it was found that only (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 was composed of small
granular particles of about 1 μm somewhat thermally fused.

2.2 Reflectance
Spectra
Figure 3 depicts the UV–vis
reflectance spectra of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.20) samples obtained
in a single-phase form. In all samples, optical absorption was observed
by the energy transition from the valence band composed of the hybrid
Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals to the conduction band composed of the Bi
6p orbital.15−18 The tetragonal β-phase samples (x = 0.03
and 0.04) exhibited strong absorption at 480 nm or shorter, whereas
the gradual spectral curve was observed for the cubic δ-phase
sample (x = 0.20). The absorption wavelengths of
the tetragonal (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0.03 and 0.04) and cubic (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 samples were obviously observed on
the longer wavelength side compared with the monoclinic Bi2O3 sample. This behavior was attributed to the fact that
the band gap energy of the formers was smaller than that of the latter.
The average Bi–O bond distance in each (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, and 0.20)
sample, which was calculated with reference to the literature,27,29 is summarized in Table 2, where the numbers in parentheses indicate the standard deviation.
The average Bi–O bond length in the crystal lattice was short
on the order of the tetragonal (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06, the cubic (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40, and the monoclinic Bi2O3 samples. Since the hybrid effect of the Bi 6s
and O 2p orbitals in the valence band increases as the Bi–O
bond distance decreases,30,31 the width of the valence
band also increases as the Bi–O bond distance becomes shorter.
As a result, the band gap energy between the valence and the conduction
bands decreases on decreasing the Bi–O bond distance.

Figure 3 UV–vis
reflectance spectra of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04,
and 0.20) samples.

Table 2 Average
Bi–O Bond Distance
in the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, and 0.20) Samples
x	crystal
system	average Bi–O bond distance/nm	
0	monoclinic	0.24636(3)	
0.03	tetragonal	0.23265(4)	
0.20	cubic	0.23703(4)	
Accordingly, the band
gap energy of each sample became small on
the order of the tetragonal (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06, the cubic (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40, and the monoclinic Bi2O3 samples, corresponding to the short of the average bond length.
Therefore, the optical absorption wavelength of the tetragonal (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 sample was
located on the lowest energy (i.e., longer wavelength) side. The slope
of the reflectance spectrum became moderate in the case of the cubic
(Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 sample,
because of the reduction of the hybrid effect due to the decrease
in the Bi3+ content. Among the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x samples synthesized in this study, the
(Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 sample
exhibited the strongest absorption in the green-blue light region
(480–490 nm), which is the complementary color of orange.

The UV–vis reflectance spectrum of the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment was compared
with those for the commercially available orange pigments such as
Bayferrox 960 and Bayferrox 4960 (Fe2O3–FeOOH,
Ozeki Co., Ltd.), as shown in Figure 4. The present (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment showed higher reflectance in the
wavelength region of 580–850 nm corresponding to the yellow-red
light as compared with the commercially available orange pigments.
But unfortunately, the reflectance in the green light region (520–570
nm) was also higher than those of the commercial ones.

and 0.20) and commercial orange
Bayferrox 960 and Bayferrox 4960 pigments are summarized in Table 3. The photographs
of these pigments are also displayed in Figure 5. It is obvious that both a* and b* values increased in a positive direction
by the introduction of Ta5+ in the host Bi2O3 lattice. Among them, the tetragonal (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 sample strongly absorbed
green and blue (complementary color of orange) lights and exhibited
the most vivid orange color with the highest a* value.

The color
of materials can be affected by a combination of factors,
such as particle size, packing density, crystal structure, and chemical
composition. As the particle size of the pigment decreases, the color
tends to be brighter or lighter.32 As shown
in Figure 2, there
was no difference in the particle size of monoclinic Bi2O3 and tetragonal (Bi1–xTax)2O3+x (x = 0.03 and 0.04). Therefore, the color
of these pigments depends on the crystal system. In contrast, the
particle size of (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 was smaller than those of other samples and the color
of (Bi0.80Ta0.20)2O3.40 was relatively light. The pale coloration can be attributed not
only to the change of the crystal structure but also the reduction
of the particle size.

As seen in Table 3, the redness value (a*)
for the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment was slightly
small compared to that of the commercial orange pigments. On the other
hand, the yellowness value (b*) was larger than that
of the commercially available orange pigments. As a result, it appeared
yellowish orange.

2.4 Chemical Stability Test
The chemical
stability of the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment was also evaluated. The powder sample was dispersed
into 4% acetic acid and 4% ammonium bicarbonate aqueous solutions.
After leaving them at room temperature for 6 h, the samples were washed
with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at room temperature.
The color of the samples after the chemical stability test was evaluated
using the colorimeter. Unfortunately, slight color degradation was
observed after the soaking test, as summarized in Table 4, so it is necessary to cover
the surface using an inert substance such as silica to suppress the
color degradation.

3 Conclusions
(Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) solid solutions were synthesized by a conventional
solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0,
0.03, 0.04, 0.20) samples depended on the composition, and monoclinic
α-phase (x = 0), tetragonal β-phase (x = 0.03, 0.04), and cubic δ-phase (x = 0.20) were obtained in a single-phase form. Among these samples,
the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment strongly absorbed the green-blue light and the band gap
energy was 2.27 eV. This pigment presented a vivid yellowish orange
color, because the redness value (a*) of this pigment
was slightly smaller and the yellowness value (b*)
was larger than those of commercial orange pigments. Although it is
necessary to improve chemical stability, the (Bi0.97Ta0.03)2O3.06 pigment has potential to
be one of the environmentally friendly inorganic orange pigments.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
The (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) samples were synthesized using a conventional
solid-state
reaction technique. Stoichiometric amounts of Bi2O3 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., 99.9%) and Ta2O5 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., 99.9%) were mixed in
an agate mortar. The homogenous mixtures were calcined in an aluminum
silicate (mullite) crucible at 800 °C for 6 h in air. Finally,
the samples were ground in an agate mortar before characterization.

4.2 Characterization
The crystal structures
were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV)
using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). The sampling width and
scan speed were 0.02 and 6.0° min–1, respectively.
The lattice parameters and volumes were calculated from the peak angles,
which were refined using α-Al2O3 as a
standard and using CellCalc Ver. 2.20 software. The sample compositions
analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (Rigaku, ZSX Primus)
were in good agreement with the nominal stoichiometric compositions
of the starting mixtures. The morphology of the (Bi1–xTax)2O3+2x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04,
and 0.20) particles was investigated by using field-emission-type
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JEOL, JSM-6701F).

The
optical reflectance spectra were measured with an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2550) with barium sulfate
as a reference. The band gap energies of the samples were calculated
from the absorption edge of the absorbance spectrum represented by
the Kubelka–Munk function, f(R) = (1 – R)2/2R, where R is reflectance.33 The color property was evaluated in terms of the Commission Internationale
de l’Éclairage L*a*b*Ch° system using a colorimeter
(Konica-Minolta, CR-300). The L* parameter indicates
the brightness or darkness of a color on relation to a neutral gray
scale, and the a* (the red-green axis) and the b* (the yellow-blue axis) parameters express the color qualitatively.
Chroma parameter (C) represents the color saturation
of the pigments and is calculated according to the following formula: C = [(a*)2 + (b*)2]1/2. The parameter h°
ranges from 0 to 360°, and is calculated with the formula, h° = tan–1(b*/a*).
