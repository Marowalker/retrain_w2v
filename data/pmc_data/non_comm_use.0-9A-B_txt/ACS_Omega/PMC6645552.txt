Fatty nitriles are widely used as
intermediate molecules in the
pharmaceutical and polymer industries. In addition, hydrogenation
of fatty nitriles produces fatty amines that are common surfactants.
In the conventional fatty nitrile process, triglycerides are first
hydrolyzed and the resulting fatty acids are catalytically reacted
with NH3 in a liquid-phase reaction. In this study, we
report a simpler one-step fatty nitrile production method that involves
a direct vapor-phase reaction of triglycerides with NH3 in the presence of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. The reactions
were performed in a tubular reactor maintained at 400 °C into
which triglycerides were injected through an atomizer to allow rapid
volatilization and reaction; NH3 was fed as a gas. Several
metal oxide catalysts were tested, and reactions in the presence of
V2O5 resulted in near-theoretical fatty nitrile
yields (84 wt % relative to the feed mass). In general, catalysts
with higher acidity such as V2O5, Fe2O3, and ZnO showed higher fatty nitrile yields compared
to low acidity catalysts such as ZrO, Al2O3,
and CuO. Energy balance calculations indicate that the one-step reaction
described here would require significantly lower energy than the conventional
process primarily because of the elimination of the energy-intense
triglyceride hydrolysis.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Triacylglycerols
(commonly known as triglycerides) from oilseeds
or algae have the potential to, at least partially, displace petroleum-derived
fuels and chemicals.1−5 Their built-in oxygenated functional groups can be utilized for
value-added chemicals, which are traditionally produced from the functionalization
and oxidation of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons.6,7 For
instance, fatty nitriles (platform molecules in pharmaceutical and
polymer industries)8 and fatty amines (common
cationic surfactant precursor),6 which
are nitrogen derivatives of fatty acids, olefins, or alcohols, can
be produced from fats and oils instead of petrochemical raw materials.
Owing to their high affinity to natural surfaces, fatty amines have
been used in surface modification applications such as fabric softening,
hair conditioning, corrosion inhibition, mineral flotation, and bactericides.9,10 Fatty amines also have good oil solubility and lubricity and are
thereby particularly useful in friction modification. In addition,
the emulsification and dispersion properties of fatty amines are exploited
in numerous cleaning and agricultural formulations.9,10 A
recent global market study on fatty amines projected that global industrial
consumption of fatty amines is expected to reach >650 000
metric
tons with a revenue of more than 2 billion US dollars by 2020.11

Figure 1 shows the
conventional routes for fatty amine production from petroleum as well
as oleaginous biomass feedstocks. Although petroleum is still the
main resource for amine production, the bio-based route is potentially
more environmentally sustainable. In the conventional bio-based process,
the first step is the conversion of triglycerides (extracted from
oilseeds) to fatty acids through hydrolysis. Subsequently, fatty nitriles
are produced through the “nitrile process”12 wherein the fatty acids are reacted with NH3 in the presence of metal oxide catalysts such as alumina
or zinc oxide (see purple box in Figure 1). The nitrile reaction is performed at 280–360
°C in the liquid state for several hours. Excess ammonia (2–4
times of the required stoichiometric value) is added, and water is
continually removed from the reactor to move the equilibrium reaction
toward nitrile production. Downstream, the fatty nitriles are hydrogenated,
typically in the presence of a nickel catalyst (e.g., RANEY Ni), to
produce fatty amines.13

Figure 1 Pathways to produce fatty
amines.

In batch implementations of the
conventional nitrile process, fatty
acids stay at a high temperature and in a liquid state for extended
periods. Consequently, several side reactions such as isomerization,
polymerization, Piria, Diels–Alder, or peroxidation reactions
can occur, particularly in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids.8,14 Moreover, in batch-reactor systems, the produced fatty nitriles
could also be hydrated to fatty amides. Thus, at the end of the reaction,
the product contains unreacted fatty acids, fatty nitriles, fatty
amides, and other undesired byproducts, thereby lowering fatty nitrile
yields and complicating product recovery. To improve the fatty nitrile
yields, some studies have investigated nitrile reactions in continuous
flow reactors packed with catalysts and fed with fatty acids and NH3.14−16 The continuous nitrile process has the potential
to decrease undesired side products (compared to batch reactors) owing
to a more efficient contact between NH3 and fatty acids,
lower reaction time (10–60 min), and continuous products removal.16 Theoretical fatty nitrile yields (70–90%)
are reported from the continuous nitrile process, and the product
stream is reported to contain unreacted fatty acids, fatty amides,
and dimers of fatty nitrile. Higher yields are possible with additional
processing such as dehydration of the intermediate fatty amide.14 Purification/distillation is used as a final
step to produce high-purity fatty nitriles required for surfactant
applications.14

An additional variation
of the nitrile process involves gas-phase
reactions of fatty acids with NH3 at a temperature range
of 300–600 °C and in the presence of a solid catalyst
bed. Gas-phase reactions can potentially prevent undesired products
owing to a short reaction time (few seconds)17,18 and better contact between NH3 and fatty acids.19 Also, gas-phase nitrile reactions significantly
decrease the tendency for dimerization/polymerization owing to a greater
distance between molecules (reactant and intermediate products), particularly
when unsaturated fatty acids are used as feedstock.5,20,21 Additionally, the process does not require
a catalyst recovery since a heterogeneous catalyst bed is used.8

In contrast to the several published studies
on the conventional
liquid-phase nitrile process, there are relatively few reports on
the gas-phase nitrile reactions of fatty acids (or its derivatives,
e.g., fatty esters). From the published literature, the important
reaction parameters that govern fatty nitrile yields in gas-phase
reactions are temperature, NH3/fatty acid molar ratio,
and catalyst type. For instance, Wortz et al.22 used silica gel as a catalyst for nitrile reaction of several fatty
acids (e.g., lauric, palmitic, and stearic acid) at reaction temperatures
of 425–450 °C. They reported high yields of long-chain
fatty nitriles (up to 98% of the theoretical yield) and only ∼1%
short chain fatty nitriles. Ralston et al.23 also carried out gas-phase nitrile reaction of long-chain fatty
esters in the presence of Al2O3 supported by
activated charcoal. In their process, the reaction was performed at
a much higher temperature (above 500 °C) to eliminate the production
of any heavy byproducts such as polymers and resins. However, higher
reaction temperatures favor the formation of short-chain fatty nitriles
owing to a C–C cleavage of the original fatty acid (feedstock).
Thus, in their study, the products were mainly composed of short-chain
fatty nitriles and hydrocarbon gases.

Various metal oxide catalysts
such as ZnO, Zr2O, and
Al2O3 have been used to convert fatty acids
(or its derivatives, e.g., fatty ester) into fatty nitrile. It has
been reported that oxides of metals from groups III and IV of the
periodic table are especially effective for fatty acid ammonization
reaction.17,23 Mekki-Berrada et al.17 studied several basic (e.g., MgO), amphoteric (e.g., ZnO,
Zr2O, and Al2O3), and acidic (WO3) solid catalysts for gas-phase nitrile reaction of lauric
acid methyl ester at reaction temperature of 300 °C. They showed
that catalysts with amphoteric character provide higher fatty nitrile
yields compared to basic or strong acidic catalysts. Although, acidic
catalysts such as Nb2O5 yielded as high as 97%
fatty nitriles, stronger acidic catalysts (e.g., bentonite and WO3) promoted side products (e.g., methyl lauramide) and decreased
the fatty nitriles yields.

Overall, the gas-phase nitrile reaction
has the potential to produce
high yield of fatty nitrile from fatty acids. Previous studies (both
gas- and liquid-phase reaction) have used fatty acid, which are typically
produced from the hydrolysis of triglycerides, as a reactant for nitrile
reactions. However, hydrolysis is an energy-intense process owing
to high temperature (250–350 °C) and pressure (45–60
bar) and requires long reaction times.24,25 Moreover,
fatty acid purification/distillation and catalyst recovery is required
after hydrolysis. Furthermore, polymerization and degradation can
occur during the hydrolysis step, particularly, in presence of unsaturated
fatty acids. If nitrile reaction can be performed in the vapor phase
by the direct reaction of triglycerides with ammonia in the presence
of a catalyst bed, the hydrolysis step as well as catalyst recovery
can be avoided. In the present work, we investigated a one-step vapor-phase
nitrile reaction to directly convert triglycerides into fatty nitrile
using diverse solid acid catalysts. Product yields were correlated
to catalyst properties. Effects of triglyceride/NH3 ratios
on product yield were assessed for reactions in the presence of V2O5 catalyst.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Feedstock Characterization
The coconut
oil used in this study was composed of 5% caprylic (C8:0), 5% capric
(C10:0), 46% lauric (C12:0), 20% myristic (C14:0), 12% palmitic (C16:0),
and 12% stearic and oleic (C18:0 and C18:1) acids (Figure S2). As expected, the coconut oil was mainly composed
of fatty acids in the C12–C18 range, which are important in
soaps, surfactants for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foodstuffs
because they carry a biocompatible lipophilic group.26

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
Table 1 shows the
physiochemical
properties of the tested catalysts. The texture properties were determined
from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K, and the acid properties
were measured by the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) method. As shown in Table 1, most of the metal oxide catalysts have
similar Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (∼2–6
m2 g–1), with the exception of HZSM-5
that has a much higher surface area (337 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.2 cm3 g–1). Figure S3 shows the NH3 desorption
profile obtained during catalyst heating. As observed, most metal
oxide catalysts (with the exception of V2O5)
showed two distinct peaks at different temperatures. The first peak
corresponds to weak/medium acidity and the second peak is from strong
acid sites on the catalyst. A summary of the catalyst acid properties
is also shown in Table 1. ZrO2, V2O5, Fe2O3, and ZnO contained more acid sites than Al2O3 and CuO. HZSM-5 showed a significantly higher acidity of
459 μmol g–1 owing to strong Brønsted
acid sites.

2.3 Product Yields and Compositions
Figure 2a shows the
liquid product yields (relative to feed mass) from the one-step vapor-phase
nitrile reaction of triglycerides in the presence of tested catalysts.
For the reaction in the absence of catalysts, glass beads (1 mm o.d.)
were packed (5 cm length) inside the reactor to maintain a similar
residence time (10 s) as the reactions in the presence of catalysts.
The dashed horizontal line represents the theoretical maximum fatty
nitrile yield. For quantitative coconut oil conversion and 100% selectivity
toward fatty nitriles (see the generalized reaction pathways in Figure S4), the mass of fatty nitriles produced
would be 598 g per mol of coconut oil fed into the reactor. Using
an average coconut oil molecular weight of 693 g mol–1 (based on measured fatty acid composition of coconut oil; Figure S2), the weight-based theoretical yield
of fatty nitriles equals 86 wt % relative to coconut oil.

Figure 2 (a) Products
composition and (b) fatty nitrile composition from
the one-step vapor-phase nitrile reaction over tested catalysts. The
sum of the individual fatty nitrile weight fractions in the product
represents the total fatty nitrile selectivity. C8–C18 represents
the carbon numbers in fatty nitriles.

From Figure 2a,
it can be seen that the liquid product from the reaction performed
in the absence of a catalyst comprises 28 wt % fatty acids, 26 wt
% fatty amides, and only 22 wt % fatty nitriles (all values are relative
to feed mass). The product also contained 6 wt % unreacted triglyceride
feed (not shown in Figure 2a). The fatty nitrile yields significantly increased in the
presence of catalysts (Figure 2a) owing to greater ammonization of the triglycerides and/or
produced fatty acids and dehydration of the fatty amides (second and
third reactions in Figure S4). It must
be noted that while the reaction scheme in Figure S4 shows the reactions of fatty acids with ammonia, it is also
possible that the triglycerides react directly with NH3. Our results show that the composition of liquid products was catalyst-dependent.
For example, a near-theoretical yield of 84 wt % fatty nitrile (relative
to feed mass) was achieved in the presence of V2O5. Yields were also high with HZSM-5 and Fe2O3—nearly 81 wt % fatty nitriles. Moderate yields of 77 and
73% were obtained with ZrO2 and ZnO, respectively. Reactions
in the presence of Al2O3 yielded only 50% fatty
nitriles, and the fatty nitrile yields were even lower (34 wt %) when
CuO was used as a catalyst. The gas chromatography–flame ionization
detection (GC–FID) chromatograms of products from the reactions
in the absence of catalysts, with Al2O3 and
V2O5 (to compare products from low- and high-yield
catalysts), are shown in Figure S5.

Figure 2b shows
the composition of the fatty nitriles in the product from the catalytic
reactions (=mass of nitrile/total product mass). The sum of the individual
fatty nitrile weight fractions in the product represents the total
fatty nitrile selectivity. We observed a mixture of C8–C18
fatty nitriles that corresponded to the C8–C18 fatty acids
esters of coconut oil (see Figure S2).
In the presence of V2O5, the selectivity was
as high as 97% such that the fatty nitrile composition was nearly
the same as the coconut oil fatty acid composition (see Figure S2). Table S1 shows the detailed composition of liquid products from all of the
reactions. Fatty nitrile products smaller than C8 or larger than C18
were not observed indicating that excessive cracking or polymerization
reactions were prevented because of the combination of low reaction
temperature and short residence time. Although the liquid product
from V2O5 contained a mixture of fatty nitriles
with different carbon chain length, sufficient boiling point differences
among the products would allow for the purification of specific fatty
nitriles via distillation, if desired.

2.4 Effects
of Catalyst Acidity on Fatty Nitrile
Yield
Vapor-phase nitrile reaction in the presence of metal
oxide catalysts improved the fatty nitrile yields; however, some catalysts
such as V2O5 and Fe2O3 showed much better fatty nitrile yields and selectivity compared
to others such as Al2O3 and CuO. To understand
the difference in performance of the tested catalysts, we further
investigated the differences in catalyst properties. Figure 3 shows that catalyst acidity
and fatty nitrile yields were positively correlated. For instance,
V2O5 showed desorption of 14 μmol NH3 per gram of catalyst and resulted in ∼84% fatty nitriles;
however, Al2O3 has 8 μmol g–1 acidity and showed only 50% fatty nitrile yields (acidity values
are given in Table 1). Moreover, the products from the one-step vapor-phase nitrile reaction
in the presence of V2O5 did not contain any
measurable fatty amide content likely owing to fast dehydration of
fatty amide in the presence of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst (see
the reaction steps in Figure S4). On the
other hand, liquid products in the presence of Al2O3 contained up to 12% fatty amide (see Figure 2a) possibly because of the lower acidity
of Al2O3 compared to V2O5. Furthermore, it is likely that the acid sites of catalysts improved
the ammonization reaction of triglyceride and/or produced fatty acid
in addition to increasing the rate of the fatty amide dehydration.
As a result, there was no evidence of triglyceride and/or fatty acid
in the liquid products when V2O5 was used. However,
the products in the presence of Al2O3 and CuO
contained fatty acid (see Figure 2a) likely owing to less ammonization of the produced
fatty acids as a result of lower catalyst acidity.

Figure 3 Correlation of catalyst
acidity and fatty nitrile yields from vapor-phase
nitrile reaction of coconut oil.

2.5 Effect of NH3/Triglyceride Molar
Ratio
Figure 4 shows the fatty acid and fatty nitrile yields from one-step vapor-phase
nitrile reactions at various NH3/triglyceride molar ratios,
and Figure S6 shows the GC–FID chromatograms
of the liquid products at various reactant molar ratios. The reactions
were performed at 400 °C using V2O5. The
molar ratios were adjusted by changing the mass flow rates of coconut
oil into the reactor while maintaining a constant NH3 flow
rate. As shown in Figure 4, in the absence of NH3, the liquid products were
mainly composed of fatty acids (76 wt % of C8–C18 fatty acids)
along with some hydrocarbons (mainly C11–C14). These results
are consistent with our previous observations of the triglyceride
pyrolysis.5 In the absence of NH3, triglycerides degrade into fatty acids and release glycerol backbone;
then, the produced fatty acids can undergo deoxygenation and produce
hydrocarbons. When stoichiometric amount of NH3 was introduced
into the reactor, the liquid products contained a mixture of fatty
nitriles and acids. The fatty acid yields decreased from 76% in the
absence of NH3 to 45% at NH3/triglyceride molar
ratio of 3 (stoichiometric value). Moreover, under these conditions,
a 41% fatty nitrile yield was obtained. The fatty nitrile yields consistently
increased when the NH3/triglyceride molar ratio increased
up to 7.5 (2.5 times of stoichiometric value) and reached the maximum
nitrile yields of ∼97%. Interestingly, there was no evidence
of fatty amide productions even when the stoichiometric amount of
NH3/triglyceride molar ratio was used. This indicates that
dehydration of fatty amides in the presence of V2O5 acid sites is a fast reaction step.

Figure 4 Effects of NH3/triglyceride molar ratio on product yields
(relative to the total mass of liquid products) from one-step vapor-phase
nitrile reaction.

2.6 Proposed
Reaction Mechanism of Fatty Nitrile
Production
Figure 5 shows the mechanism for the production of fatty nitrile from
triglyceride over Al2O3. Although the yields
were lower with Al2O3 than with other catalysts,
the reaction mechanism is described with this catalyst because its
structure is well-known. Partially dehydroxylated metal oxides provide
acidic sites, and the density of the Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites
on the surface highly depends on the dehydroxylation temperature and
gas flow. In our reactor system, high temperature and flow of inert
gas (N2) were applied prior to the exposure of the metal
oxide to ammonia and triglyceride to generate active sites. We propose
that the adsorption of ammonia over the surface acidic sites and its
activation to form a bridging amide (−NH2) is a
plausible initiation step in this process (see Figure 5a). Then, we hypothesize that a series of
acid–base reactions occur as shown in Figure 5b. The nucleophile O on carboxylic group
coordinates with the electrophile Al and the electrophile C on the
carboxylic group undergo nucleophilic attack by strongly basic −NH2 to generate the active complex i. Transfer of
alkoxy group from the intermediate ii to the Lewis acidic
site yields a bridging alkoxide and the desired fatty amide product.
The produced fatty amide undergoes dehydration (Figure 5c) and yields fatty nitrile and water. While
this reaction can occur at high temperatures even in the absence of
a catalyst, the acidic catalyst sites facilitate the dehydration reaction.
The alkoxide-bridged surface species is active and can act as an active
site and regenerate the catalyst (Figure 5d).

2.7 Comparison
between Conventional and One-Step
Vapor-Phase Nitrile Process
Table 2 shows the energy consumption during the
conventional and one-step vapor-phase nitrile process. A detailed
energy calculation and assumptions are given in the Supporting Information (see Figure S7 and accompanying description).
In the conventional nitrile process, the first step is the hydrolysis
of triglycerides to produce fatty acids. A triglyceride/water ratio
of 1/5, temperature of 250 °C, pressure of 45 bar, and 100% triglyceride
conversion were used to calculate the energy required in the hydrolysis
step.24,25 As shown in Table 2, hydrolysis of 1 kg of triglyceride requires
a minimum energy of 5652 kJ. Moreover, conversion of the fatty acid
into fatty nitrile through the conventional nitrile process requires
a minimum energy of 387 kJ kg–1 triglyceride. Assuming
that 75% of the consumed energy can be recovered via appropriate heat
exchange, the conventional method requires more than 1500 kJ to convert
1 kg of triglyceride into fatty nitriles.

The one-step vapor-phase nitrile reaction requires energy for increasing
the feedstock temperature from ambient to the boiling point (∼400
°C) and also vaporization. From Table 2, one can see that the one-step vapor-phase
nitrile process requires only 925 kJ kg–1 triglyceride
for this step. This energy requirement would even decrease to 230
kJ kg–1 triglyceride if 75% energy recovery could
be achieved through heat exchange from the hot product stream. The
lower energy consumption in our system is because of the elimination
of the hydrolysis step. Furthermore, the one-step vapor-phase nitrile
process eliminates (or at least significantly decreases) the complicated
distillation/purification steps required in the hydrolysis and fatty
nitrile production steps through the conventional process. Overall,
the one-step vapor-phase nitrile reaction is able to directly transform
triglyceride into fatty nitrile at nearly theoretical yields with
lower energy consumption and potentially much simpler reactors and
separation units.

3 Conclusions
The
one-step vapor-phase fatty nitrile production was performed
in a single reactor, in which triglyceride reacted with ammonia. In
the absence of a catalyst, the products contained 28% fatty acid,
26% fatty amide, and only 21% fatty nitrile (relative to the feed).
However, the fatty nitrile yields significantly increased when a catalyst
was used. A near-theoretical fatty nitrile yield of 84% (relative
to feed mass) was achieved from the nitrile process in the presence
of V2O5. Catalysts such as Fe2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, and HZSM-5 also showed high fatty
nitrile yields. However, the fatty nitrile yields were low in the
presence of Al2O3 and CuO, likely because of
the low acidity of these catalysts. Overall, nitrile yields positively
correlated with catalyst acidity. The results showed that a minimum
NH3/triglyceride molar ratio of 7.5 is required to achieve
a near-theoretical fatty nitrile yield. Energy assessments suggest
that the one-step vapor-phase nitrile process would require lower
energy inputs than the conventional nitrile process. Furthermore,
owing to the high purity of the nitrile product, purification/distillation
steps are expected to be simple. Finally, catalyst recovery from the
hydrolysis reactions and the nitrile production steps in the conventional
nitrile process is eliminated owing to the vapor-phase reaction of
triglyceride.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Coconut oil was obtained
from Zoye Oil (Zeeland, MI, USA). The following catalysts were purchased
from Strem Chemicals, Inc. (Newburyport, MA, USA)—V2O5, Fe2O3, ZrO2, ZnO,
Al2O3, and CuO. NH4-ZSM-5 powder
with an SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of
23 was purchased from Zeolyst International (Conshohocken, PA, USA).
The purchased NH4-ZSM-5 was calcinated in a muffle furnace
for 5.5 h at 550 °C to obtain HZSM-5. Hexane, chloroform, methanol,
and sulfuric acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). Analytical standards of lauric nitrile, lauramide, lauric
acid, glycerides (triolein, diolein, and monolein), and fatty acid
methyl ester (FAMEs; mixtures of C8–C22) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

4.2 Experimental
Setup
All experiments
were performed in a continuous vapor-phase reactor system that is
schematically shown in Figure 6, as described previously.5 Prior
to each experiment, the reactor was packed with catalysts, placed
in the furnace, and heated while being purged with pure N2 to remove any traces of H2O and O2 from the
system. After the reactor reached the set point temperature, the N2 purge was stopped. Then, NH3 gas was introduced
into the reactor at a controlled flow rate measured by a mass flow
meter (Alicat Scientific, USA). Thereafter, feed coconut oil was introduced
into the reactor in the form of micron-size droplets through an atomizer
(Sonazop, Farmingdale, NY, USA; model: HTNS40). The atomizer consists
of an ultrasonic probe with a 4 mm diameter, which was operated at
a constant frequency of 40 kHz. The atomizer used in our reactor system
creates extremely large surface area for heat transfer and allows
the rapid evaporation of feedstock. The system was operated in continuous
mode for 3 h, and the products were condensed in a liquid N2 trap. At the end of the experiment, feed flow (NH3 and
coconut oil) was stopped and the reactor furnace was turned off and
allowed to cool to room temperature. Thereafter, the collected liquid
products were weighed on an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo, USA)
with ±0.1 mg accuracy. The liquid product was separated in a
separatory funnel into aqueous and organic phases.

The conversion of coconut oil
to nonglyceride products was calculated

conditions for the reaction. The reactor temperature was set at 400
°C to allow vaporization of feedstock and simultaneously prevent
extensive cracking reactions.23 Previous
studies on the ammonization of fatty acids reported a residence time
range of 3–13 s as the sufficient contact time for fatty nitrile
production.17 As such, the residence time
in our experiments was set to 10 s by introducing 8.9 mL min–1 NH3 (at room temperature, 20 °C) into the reactor
that was packed with 3.4 cm3 of catalyst. An NH3/triglyceride molar ratio of 12 (4× stoichiometric amount) was
used to allow the reversible reactions to proceed in the forward direction.

4.4 Catalyst Characterization
Texture
properties of catalysts were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at 77 K by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Prior to
the analysis, the samples were pretreated at 350 °C for 3 h under
vacuum to remove any adsorbed compounds. Multipoint adsorption isotherms
were obtained on the samples using N2 as the adsorbate.
The BET equation was used to calculate the surface area, and the micropore
volume was determined by the t-plot method.27,28

The NH3-TPD technique is a useful method to measure
the catalyst acidity and the strength of acid sites.29 In this study, a custom dynamically pumped TPD system was
used as shown schematically in Figure S1. Prior to each TPD measurement, ∼130 mg of the catalyst was
degassed at 350 °C under high vacuum (<10–6 Torr) for at least 5 h. Then, 100 mg of the degassed catalyst was
weighed and transferred into a borosilicate glass tube with an inner
diameter of 7 mm and placed inside the TPD furnace. Thereafter, the
system was evacuated for 30 min to remove trace air and H2O. Subsequently, the valve connected to the main chamber (gas detector)
was closed, and the NH3 gas was introduced into the sample
tube that was placed inside the furnace at 80 °C. During this
step, NH3 was allowed to adsorb on the catalyst surface
for 1 h. Thereafter, the NH3 injection was stopped, the
main chamber valve (see Figure S1) was
opened, and the sample tube was again pumped down to high vacuum for
∼1 h to reduce the NH3 partial pressure to the background
level (<10–6 Torr). In other words, all “free
NH3” in the system was pumped out with the exception
of the NH3 adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Afterward,
the catalyst was heated to 600 °C at a constant ramp rate of
5 °C min–1. The NH3 gas desorbing
from the catalysts was monitored by a mass spectrometer (RGA 300,
Stanford Research System) connected to the dynamically pumped high-vacuum
TPD chamber (see Figure S1). Mass spectra
in the range 1–50 atomic mass units (amu) were recorded in
3 s intervals. The concentration of the desorbed NH3 was
measured by the integrated-signal approach as reported previously.30

4.5 Feedstock and Products
Analysis
The
coconut oil was transesterified to FAMEs and analyzed by gas chromatography
using mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and GC–FID to identify
and quantify the fatty acid constituents in the feedstock, as explained
elsewhere.5

The GC–MS (Bruker,
450-GC equipped with 300-MS) analysis was also performed to identify the chemical constituents in the liquid products
from the reaction. An Agilent DB-5MS-fused silica capillary column
(length: 30 m, i.d.: 0.25 mm, and film thickness: 0.25 μm; Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was employed, where the column was
initially set at 30 °C for 10 min, then heated at 10 °C
min–1 to 300 °C, and finally held at 300 °C
for 10 min. The injector, transfer line, ion source, and manifold
were maintained at 300, 300, 150, and 40 °C, respectively.

To quantify the chemical compounds in the products,
GC–FID (Shimadzu 2012 plus) with an RTX-biodiesel (Restek,
Bellefonte, PA, USA) column (15 m length, 0.32 mm i.d., and 0.1 μm
film thickness) was used. The column temperature was programmed as
follows: initially set at 60 °C for 1 min, followed by a temperature
ramp rate of 10 °C min–1 to 370 °C and
a final hold for 5 min. The injector and FID temperatures were maintained
at 370 °C. The FID detector response was first calibrated using
standards of known concentrations of FAME, fatty acid, fatty amide,
fatty nitrile, monoolein, diolein, and triolein. The chemical compound
concentrations in the samples (liquid products and feedstock) were
estimated from the calibration curves as described previously.5,31−33
