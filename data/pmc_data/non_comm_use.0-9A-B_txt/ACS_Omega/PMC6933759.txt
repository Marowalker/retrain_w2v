Stable carbon isotope (δ(13C)) analysis
can provide
information concerning the starting materials and the production process
of a material. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are produced using a variety
of starting materials, catalysts, and production methods. The use
of δ(13C) as a tool to infer the nature of starting
materials to gain insight into the mechanics of CNT growth was evaluated.
The production process of NRC’s SWCNT-1 was traced via the
δ(13C) measurement of the available starting materials,
intermediate products, and the final product. As isotopic fractionation
is likely negligible at high temperatures, the δ(13C) value of the starting materials was reflected in the δ(13C) value of the final CNT product. For commercially available
CNTs, the estimated δ(13C) values of identified starting
materials were related to the δ(13C) signatures of
CNTs. Using this information and the δ(13C) values
of CNTs, the nature of unknown carbon sources was inferred for some
samples. The use of δ(13C) analysis may be used as
a tracer to differentiate between those processes that use relatively 13C-depleted carbon source(s) such as carbon monoxide, methane,
or natural gas, and those that do not.

Introduction
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a class of
materials that have been
extensively studied in the past 3 decades.1−6 CNTs resemble seamless rolled graphene sheets and can exist in various
forms: as single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs),
multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs), and few-walled CNTs. Depending on their
helicity, SWCNTs can be either metallic or semiconducting, and have
been incorporated into many everyday products such as batteries, sporting
goods, electronics, sensors, household products, etc.3,7

As the properties of CNTs are mainly dictated by the carbon-containing
starting materials, the catalysts, and the production methods and
conditions, there is an endless list of methods used to manufacture
CNTs. Production methods can be classified into several broad categories,
including but not limited to, electric arc discharge (EAD), laser
ablation (or laser vaporization), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).1−6 Further, almost any carbon-containing material can serve as a starting
material for CNT production, and the choice of starting materials
is somewhat dictated by the production method. For EAD or laser ablation,
graphite is the most common starting material; however, studies using
electric arc discharge with hydrocarbons, carbon black, coal,4 and biomaterials8 have
been reported. Conversely, CVD is probably the most diverse CNT production
method in terms of starting materials and catalysts, which are important
parameters to control to produce large quantities of high-quality,
pure CNTs. Several hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethene, acetylene,
and benzene, alcohols including ethanol, and natural oils, are frequently
used as starting materials with a variety of metal catalysts.1,6 Other processes including the high-pressure carbon monoxide method
(HiPCO)9 and the cobalt–molybdenum-catalyst
(CoMoCAT)10 process both use carbon monoxide
(CO) as the starting material.

Stable carbon isotope (δ(13C)) analysis is a frequently
used forensic tool for many applications, including source appropriation
of pollutants, and determining the provenance of samples (food, humans,
etc.).11,12 The δ(13C) value of a sample
can provide information concerning the starting materials and production
process used to manufacture the sample, with two main factors determining
the resulting δ(13C) value: (1) the δ(13C) values and relative proportion of the starting materials
and (2) the extent of fractionation that may occur during the manufacturing
process. As the temperature of the CNT production processes can surpass
700 °C, isotopic fractionation (i.e., the preferential incorporation
of either the heavy or light isotope from the starting material(s)
into the final product) attributed to the manufacturing process is
likely very small or negligible,13 and
the δ(13C) value of the sample would be mostly dictated
by the δ(13C) value(s) of the starting material(s).
Since a wide range of carbon-containing starting materials are available
to manufacture CNTs, it follows that the resulting range of δ(13C) values of CNTs may also be large, potentially ranging
from −10‰ (for CNTs manufactured from C4-based materials
such as ethanol) to −55‰ or more negative (for CNTs
derived from hydrocarbons or CO).14

Although CNTs have been extensively studied, direct observation
and measurement during CNT nucleation and growth is very challenging.
Current understanding of CNT growth mechanics is largely based on
numerical simulations and theories that are consistent with observations
of the final CNT product. Some studies15,16 have used
labeled compounds to further elucidate the growth mechanism of CNTs
using a single material as the sole carbon source. As CNTs are produced
using a variety of carbon sources, catalysts, and under different
environmental controls, it is difficult to make any generalization
about growth mechanisms other than about the specific method being
studied. However, by measuring both the quantity and the δ(13C) value of (each of) the carbon-containing starting material(s),
δ(13C) analysis has the potential to estimate the
relative amount of the carbon-containing starting material(s) incorporated
into the final product, information which may help to elucidate the
growth mechanism of a particular CNT, or may be helpful in source
appropriation studies.

In 2011, the National Research Council
Canada (NRC) produced a
high-purity SWCNT certified reference material (CRM), SWCNT-1.8 In an effort to gain more information concerning
the growth mechanism of this CNT, we measured the δ(13C) signatures of the available starting materials, samples taken
during the production and subsequent collection process, and the final
product. Further, we analyzed the δ(13C) values of
several commercially available CNTs in an effort to determine if the
starting material of a CNT can be predicted based on the measured
δ(13C) value. To our knowledge, only one other study
has reported δ(13C) measurements for commercially
available CNTs,17 and our δ(13C) measurements will be compared to the available literature.

SWCNT-1 Production
The production process of SWCNT-1
via laser vaporization is depicted in Figure 1. The principal carbon source was a biochar
derived from the pyrolysis of a hardwood (Ensyn Technologies Inc.),
a unique and renewable starting material. A graphite adhesive and
cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) catalysts were added to the biochar, and
the mixture was pressed into a pellet, then cured at 850 °C in
argon. The cured pellet was then mounted on a molybdenum stub support,
heated to 1200 °C under a stream of 5% CO in argon (Ar) at 0.66
bar (500 torr), and vaporized with two 1064 nm lasers.18,19 The raw SWCNT was recovered from condensation sites, and this material
was homogenized and solvent-washed to remove the residual material,
then sieved through a 400 μm sieve to produce clean SWCNT. The
clean SWCNT was heated to 1000 °C for 30 min, then cooled to
room temperature to produce the final product, SWCNT-1.

Figure 1 Production
process of SWCNT-1.

Several samples from this production process were
analyzed, including
the biochar, a cured pellet, raw SWCNT, clean SWCNT, and three bottles
of the final product, SWCNT-1. Five samples from the pellet were obtained
by snapping it by hand into pieces and scraping the inside surface
of each piece at the cleavage site.

Graphite Samples and Commercially Available CNTs
Three
graphite samples were analyzed for this study: one sample obtained
from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA), and the other two were from unknown
sources. Several CNT samples were procured from several suppliers
(Table 1), and these
samples varied with respect to the number of walls and the production
method. For many of these samples, information concerning the starting
materials was not available.

Carbon Isotope Notation and Traceability
Stable carbon
isotope measurements of a sample are expressed on the VPDB scale 1  where RSAM and RSTD are the ratio of 13-C/12-C (i.e., n(13C)/n(12C)) in
the sample and standard, respectively, and VPDB refers to Vienna PeeDee
Belemnite. Since 2005, the VPDB scale was realized using two modern
CRMs, LSVEC (lithium carbonate) and NBS 19 (calcium carbonate), which
have exact δ(13C) values of −46.6 and +1.95‰.
IUPAC no longer recommends the use of LSVEC. However, δ(13C) measurements must be normalized to the VPDB scale using
at least two suitable reference materials selected by the analyst.20 Throughout this work, δVPDB13C is shortened to δ(13C).

Results and Discussion
δ13C Measurements of SWCNT-1 CRM and its Production
Intermediates
The δ(13C) value of a product
can provide insight into the nature of the starting materials used
and/or the manufacturing process. To trace the δ(13C) values throughout the production of NRC’s CRM SWCNT-1,
the biochar and various samples collected at different stages throughout
the production process (Figure 1) were analyzed (Figure 2).

Figure 2 δ(13C) values of samples taken during
the production
of SWCNT-1. Error bars represent the SD on replicate analyses. For
details on the production process, see the text.

The biochar had a measured δ(13C) value of −26.78
± 0.03‰ (N = 4) and is consistent with
hardwood trees with a C3 photosynthetic pathway.21 Graphite adhesive, cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) catalysts
were added to the biochar, pressed into a pellet, and the pellet was
cured at 850 °C in Ar. The graphite adhesive is a viscous paste
comprised of graphite powder in furfuryl alcohol. During curing, the
furfuryl alcohol polymerizes and graphitizes, leaving only graphitic
carbon in the pellet. A sample of graphite adhesive was attempted
to be measured for δ(13C) values; however, the sample
was old and had a tar-like consistency, suggesting that the only available
sample was likely compromised.

The average δ(13C) value obtained from five different
sampling sites of one pellet, with four sites analyzed in duplicate
and one in triplicate, was −30.86 ± 0.47‰ (N = 11), with individual measurements ranging from −30.25
to −31.73‰. With a sample size of only 100 μg,
it is possible that the pellet was not homogenous at this small scale,
resulting in a 1.5‰ difference between sampling sites. Regardless,
the pellet is ∼4–5‰ more negative than the biochar.
The curing process incorporates carbon from both the graphite powder
and the furfuryl alcohol, with a net result of incorporation of carbon
atoms with a more negative δ(13C) value than the
biochar.

The cured pellet was then vaporized with two lasers
under a stream
of 5% CO in Ar in a 1200 °C oven.18,19 The δ(13C) value of the recovered raw SWCNT was −35.62 ±
0.18‰ (N = 4), which is ∼4–5‰
more negative than the cured pellet from which it was derived. As
this process occurred at 1200 °C, isotopic fractionation during
this manufacturing process is expected to be very small or negligible,13 and the δ(13C) value of the
final product should reflect the relative proportion of all sources
of carbon incorporated into its structure. The CO in the CO + Ar gas
stream was not directly measured. CO is typically derived from the
oxidation of methane, and the δ(13C) of methane can
range between −50 and −110‰ for biogenically
formed methane, and from −20 to −50‰ for thermogenic
processes.22 Two commercial tanks of methane
of unknown origin were measured to be −38 and −51‰.14 NRC obtained a CO reference gas with a calibrated
δ(18O) value of −6.2‰, and an estimated
δ(13C) value of −55.5‰. As the estimated
δ(13C) value of the CO used in SWCNT-1 production
was most likely more negative than the pellet, carbon from the CO
was likely incorporated into the raw SWCNT structure.

The extent
of CO incorporation into the raw SWCNT (Table 2) can be theoretically estimated
by varying an assumed δ(13C) value for the CO and
using the mass balance equation 2  where apellet and δ13Cpellet are the mass fraction and δ(13C) value of the pellet, respectively, bCO and δ13CCO are the mass fraction and δ(13C) value of the CO, respectively, δ13Craw SWCNT is the δ(13C) value of the raw SWCNT, and apellet + bCO = 1.

–80	0.90	0.10	
a The δ13C values
of the pellet and raw SWCNT were −30.86 and −35.62‰,
respectively.

Using this method, the theoretical estimated percentage
of carbon
incorporated into the final product can vary between 10 and 52%, with
decreasing amount of carbon from CO incorporation with increasingly
negative assumed δ(13C) CO values. To fully understand
the distribution of carbon from all starting materials, future experiments
will include the δ(13C) measurement of all starting materials and
potential sources of carbon, intermediate products from various steps
in the production process, and the resulting CNT sample.

The
subsequent homogenization and solvent washes of the raw SWCNT
to remove the residual material did not significantly alter the δ(13C) value (clean SWCNT δ(13C) = −36.20
± 0.13‰ (N = 2)), and the average δ(13C) values of the three bottles of the final product SWCNT-1
were very similar: −35.96 ± 0.17‰ (N = 4), −35.97 ± 0.04‰ (N = 2),
and −36.04 ± 0.01‰ (N = 2). The
average δ(13C) value of the three bottles of SWCNT-1
was −35.98 ± 0.11‰ (N = 8), and
little variation in the δ(13C) value between the
three bottles was observed. Although this material was not originally
intended to be used as a δ(13C) CRM,8 these initial measurements may serve as an informative
δ(13C) value for SWCNT-1. Additional analyses are
planned to provide a more robust δ(13C) value assignment
to SWCNT-1, and to evaluate δ(13C) measurement uncertainty.
Further, although most CNTs are produced at high temperatures where
fractionation of the starting materials is likely small or negligible,
CNTs produced at lower temperatures23 should
be evaluated for fractionation of the carbon source material during
the production process.

δ(13C) Survey of CNTS
The δ(13C) values of commercially available CNTs are presented in Figure 3. The CNTs varied
with respect to the number of walls and production methods. For many
of these samples, information concerning the starting materials was
not available. As these processes usually involve high temperatures,
the measured δ(13C) values of the samples are assumed
to reflect that of the starting material(s). Based on the δ(13C) values of the CNTs, inferences concerning the source of
the starting materials can be made and may be used as a tool to differentiate
between CNT sources.

carbon nanotubes, MWCNT = multiwalled carbon nanotubes, FWCNT = few-walled
carbon nanotubes, CNF = carbon nanofiber). Error bars represent the
SD on replicate analyses.

δ(13C) Values of Samples with Identified Carbon
Sources
Sample SW-1 (discussed above) had three possible
carbon sources: biochar, graphite adhesive, and CO, all of which likely
contributed carbon to the final product. Both the HiPCO and CoMoCAT
processes use CO as the starting material9,10 and
other researchers have reported δ(13C) values ranging
from −49.8 to −51.7‰ from SWCNT samples produced
using these methods.17 Sample SW-11 was
produced using the HiPCO method and yielded the most negative δ(13C) value measured in this study, −55.32‰, consistent
with previously published data.17 Samples
SW-9, SW-10, and FW-1 were manufactured using the CoMoCAT process.
While SW-10 and FW-1 showed relatively negative δ(13C) values of −43.86 and −43.85‰ (for two separate
bottles of SW-10), and −42.78‰ (for FW-1), SW-9 measured
a relatively more positive δ(13C) value of −34.16‰,
which may reflect the extent of variation in the δ(13C) values of the CO used in the manufacturing process.

Sample
SW-5, with a δ(13C) value of −43.59‰,
was obtained from OcSiAl, with the brand name Tuball. While the production
process of this particular sample was not verified, the manufacturing
process used by this company involves the use of EAD to produce plasma,
and hydrocarbons between C1 and C10 can be the carbon source.24 δ(13C) values of methane (C1),
ethane (C2), and propane (C3) in natural gas samples can range from
−26 to −73‰,25 and
methane between −20 and −110‰,22 which is consistent with natural gas as a carbon source
for SW-5.

δ(13C) Values of Samples with Inferred Carbon
Sources
Three other samples (SW-2, SW-3, and SW-4) were produced
via the EAD method, with δ(13C) values ranging between
−31.13 and −35.19‰, a similar range to that reported
by other researchers (−23.5 to −36.7‰17). The most common source material for this process
is graphite.4 For this study, three graphite
samples were analyzed, with δ(13C) values of −24.57,
−26.15, and −27.07‰, and graphite samples as
negative as −41‰ have been reported.14 The measured δ(13C) values for SW-2, SW-3,
and SW-4 are consistent with graphite as a source material.

Inferring Carbon Sources Based on δ(13C) Measurements
Reliable information concerning the source materials could not
be found for nine CNT samples produced via the CVD method. This method
can use a wide variety of catalysts, carbon sources, and operating
conditions to produce CNTs.1,6 Based on the measured
δ(13C) values from the samples with known or inferred
carbon sources, the type of carbon source(s) was anticipated.

Both MW-3 and SW-6 had similar δ(13C) values of
−32.69 and −33.21‰, respectively. SW-6 was produced
via a supergrowth CVD method, and previous research using this method
reported the use of ethylene as the source material.26 The δ(13C) value of SW-6 and MW-3 is consistent
with a reported δ(13C) value of −35.2‰
for a SWCNT sample with a known ethylene source,17 which may be a likely source material for these two samples.
Two different lots of sample MW-1 both had average δ(13C) values of −26.32‰, which were the most positive
δ(13C) values measured from this study. This relatively
more positive δ(13C) value is consistent with being
derived from a plant source with a C3-based photosynthetic pathway,
with a range of −21 to −35‰.21

Samples SW-7, SW-8, MW-2, DW-1, and NF-1 all demonstrated
relatively
negative δ(13C) values between −42.20 and
−49.06‰. Of the CNTs with known carbon sources measured
in this study and in the literature,17 only
CNTs using CO, methane, or natural gas, had δ(13C)
values more negative than −40‰. Therefore, we suggest
that CNTs with relatively negative δ(13C) values
(for instance, those with δ(13C) values more negative
than −40‰) may use CO (or methane or natural gas) as
either the sole starting material, or as was observed with SW-1, as
at least one of the carbon-containing components that is incorporated
into the CNT structure.

Conclusions
Stable carbon isotope analysis of both
the starting materials and
the final product can provide insight into the nature of the starting
materials and the mechanics of the production process. For the NRC
CRM SWCNT-1, δ(13C) measurements of the carbon-containing
starting materials and samples collected at different stages throughout
the production process demonstrated that three sources of carbon were
likely incorporated into the final product. For some commercially
available CNTs, the carbon source material was known or could be inferred
based on the production method and in most cases were related to the
source material. The δ(13C) values of commercially
available CNTs with unknown starting materials were used to infer
the carbon sources of these products. Given that the starting materials,
exact quantities and nature of catalysts, and production conditions
used in the production of CNTs are proprietary, we suggest that the
use of δ(13C) analysis may be used as a tracer to
differentiate between those processes that use CO (or similarly 13C-depleted carbon source(s) such as methane or natural gas)
and those that do not.

Experimental Section
All samples received no treatment
prior to δ(13C) analysis. Approximately, 100 μg
of carbon nanotube samples
and a microscoop of the combustion aid vanadium pentoxide (V2O5; Elemental Microanalysis, Okehampton, U.K.) were added
to tin capsules (Elemental Microanalysis; Okehampton, U.K.) and loaded
onto an 80-position autosampler carousel for δ(13C) analysis. All analyses were performed on an elemental analyzer
(EA, Vario EL III, Elementar Americas Inc., Mt. Laurel, NJ) interfaced
to a Delta+XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS, Thermo
Fisher; Bremen, Germany) via a Conflow III gas flow controller (Thermo
Fisher; Bremen, Germany). The flow rate of the helium (99.999% purity;
Air Liquide; Montreal, QC, Canada) was ∼155 mL/min. The combustion
and reduction reactors were held at 950 and 500 °C, respectively.
No sample helium dilution was used for the analyses.

Samples
were analyzed in four sequences. To minimize any potential
carryover due to incomplete combustion, an empty space was included
after every blank, sample, and CRM. In all cases, the total area signal
of the empty space was similar in magnitude to blank samples, suggesting
complete conversion of the carbon sample to CO2. Blank
samples, both with V2O5 and without, were included
at the beginning and end of the sequences, and comprised ≤2%
of the total area signal. All analyses were blank-corrected, using
either the blanks with no V2O5 (for CRMs with
no added V2O5) or blanks with V2O5 (for all samples and USGS24). No drift corrections were applied
to any of the analysis sequences. The IUPAC recommended algorithm
for correction of the oxygen-17 contribution to the ion beam at m/z 45 was applied to all analyses.27

All samples were normalized to four CRMs:
a suite of three sugar
CRMs from NRC:28 BEET-1 (δ(13C) = −26.02‰), GALT-1 (δ(13C) = −21.41‰),
and FRUT-1 (δ(13C) = −10.98‰) and NBS-22
(δ(13C) = −30.03‰29). Two quality control (QC) samples were included with each
set of reference materials: USGS24, graphite (δ(13C) = −16.05‰29) and an internal
QC material (δ13C = −22.95‰). A microscoop
of V2O5 was added to USGS24, but no combustion
aids were added to BEET-1, GALT-1, FRUT-1, NBS-22, or the internal
QC sample. The coefficients of determination (R2) for each normalization curve were ≥0.998. The average
δ(13C) values ± standard deviation (SD) of USGS24,
which is the closest matrix-matched QC to the samples, were −15.94
± 0.09‰ (N = 5), −15.90 ±
0.23‰ (N= 4), −16.14
± 0.18‰ (N = 3), and −16.09 ±
0.17‰ (N = 3) for the four analysis runs.
As these average δ(13C) values are within the accepted
δ13C value of USGS24, −16.05‰, with
a standard uncertainty of 0.07‰,30 we are confident that the use of organic CRMs with no addition of
V2O5 to normalize carbon-only samples did not
introduce any appreciable bias on the measured δ(13C) values. The average δ(13C) values ± SD of
the second QC material were −22.92 ± 0.06‰ (N = 5), −22.97 ± 0.16‰ (N = 4), −23.03 ± 0.21‰ (N = 5),
and −22.99 ± 0.38‰ (N = 3) and
were similar to the known value of −22.95‰. All samples
were analyzed in at least duplicate, and the SD was <0.50‰
for all replicate measurements.
