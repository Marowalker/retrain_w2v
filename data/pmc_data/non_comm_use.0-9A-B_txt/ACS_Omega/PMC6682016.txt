A multifunctional
supramolecular assembly was successfully constructed
by the host–guest complexation of doubly positively charged
adamantane (ADA) with β-CD-modified hexabenzocoronene and the
π-stacking of coronene with mitoxantrone, which was characterized
by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
dynamic light-scattering, and zeta potential experiments. Possessing
a small size and rigid backbone coronene center, the water-soluble
biocompatible supramolecular assembly has intracellular imaging abilities.
Moreover, after the ester group of ADA was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl
group, the positively charged quaternary amine strand converted into
a zwitterion structure, which realized the controlled plasmid DNA
binding and release. Besides, the cytotoxicity experiments showed
that the supramolecular assembly possesses slightly lower toxicity
and a slightly higher anticancer activity than free drug. We believe
that this work might present a convenient method for synergetic cancer
treatment.

1 Introduction
The construction of multifunctional nanocarriers incorporating
two or more different therapeutic strategies with synergistic effects
has recently emerged as a promising approach for improving cancer
therapy.1−3 To this end, a number of multifunctional carriers
based on inorganic nanoparticles,4 carbon
nanomaterials,5 liposomes,6 and vesicles7 were constructed
and exhibited effective therapeutic activities to cancer cells. Nevertheless,
the synthetic procedure is complicated and time-consuming to construct
multifunctional integrated diagnosis, imaging, and drug delivery systems
with multifarious therapeutic approaches, which hinder the further
advance. In this regard, supramolecular host–guest complexation
provides a facile and rapid procedure to construct complicated molecular
assemblies through noncovalent interactions, because the representative
macrocycles, such as cyclodextrin (CD), is water-soluble, nontoxic,
and possessing a hydrophobic cavity, which can construct biocompatible
supramolecular assemblies with various substrates in biomedical science.8−17 For instance, Liu and co-workers developed a new type of magnetism
and photo dual-controlled supramolecular nanofiber that integrates
targeting peptide-coated magnetic nanoparticles with β-CD-bearing
polysaccharides for suppression of tumor invasion and metastasis,
demonstrating that the nanofibers provide a convenient tool for tumor
therapy.18 Besides, the effective macrocycle-based
delivery systems with suitable size, good water solubility, and stability
in physiological environments still deserve our careful attention.19−23

It is significant to note that multifunctional nanocarriers
simultaneously
loading imaging and therapeutic agents have appeared as a potential
candidate in imaging-guided therapy to realize early detection and
prompt treatment of cancer.24,25 Among various imaging
agents, nanographenes (coronene derivatives) have attracted considerable
attention because of their intrinsic properties including superior
fluorescence emission, anti-photobleaching ability, and intermolecular
π–π stacking behaviors.26−28 In this work,
a conjugated supramolecular assembly was constructed by the noncovalent
multiple interactions with β-CD-modified hexabenzocoronene (HBCCD)
as scaffold centers, which could simultaneous intracellular imaging
and plasmid DNA (pDNA) binding and anticancer drug loading. The chemical
structure and construction route for the preparation of HBCCD–ADA
fluorescent supramolecular assembly are shown in Scheme 1. There are some unique characteristics
of such a system: (1) a small size coronene derivative was chosen
as scaffold because of its inherent fluorescence properties, which
could act as a fluorescence probe to real-time monitor the drug release,
distribution, and accumulation of the supramolecular assembly; (2)
the controlled binding and release of pDNA was easily achieved via
ester hydrolyze into “zwitterionic” structure;29−31 and (3) anticancer drugs, such as mitoxantrone (MTZ), could be readily
integrated into the water-soluble supramolecular assembly of HBCCD–adamantane
(ADA) by the π–π stacking interaction between the
coronene surface and the aromatic ring of drug molecule MTZ. Therefore,
this water-soluble and biocompatibility multifunctional nanostructure
is taken into account as a novel strategy for improving cancer treatment.

Scheme 1 Construction of HBCCD–ADA Supramolecular Assembly
2 Results
and Discussion
Benefiting from the strong host–guest
inclusion complexation
between ADA and β-CD,32 the fluorescent
supramolecular assembly was prepared by simply mixing the aqueous
solutions of ADA and HBCCD together. The structural and morphological
features of the HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), dynamic light-scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements.
The TEM image in Figure 1a showed that HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly have a spherical
morphology with a diameter of ca. 300 nm. The SEM image (Figure 1b) also showed the
280–310 nm homogeneous spherical nanoparticles. Moreover, DLS
measurement indicated that the hydrodynamic diameter of HBCCD–ADA
assembly was ca. 465 nm with a narrow distribution (Figure 1c), which was in accordance
with the results in microscopic images. The zeta potential of HBCCD–ADA
was measured as ca. +14.8 mV (Figure 1d), suggesting that the surface charge of assembly
was positive charged, which is beneficial to promote the electrostatic
interaction between HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly and pDNA.

Figure 1 Typical
(a) TEM and (b) SEM images of HBCCD–ADA supramolecular
assembly. (c) DLS and (d) zeta potential experiment results of HBCCD–ADA
supramolecular assembly in deionized aqueous solution.

Considering that the quaternary amine strands of
ADA were positively
charged in aqueous solution, the HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly
could be used to bind nucleic acid via electrostatic interaction.
The pDNA binding behavior was examined by evaluating the electrophoretic
mobility at different N/P ratios in agarose gel. As shown in Figure 2a,b, pDNA was completely
retarded by HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly at an N/P ratio
of 10, which was much lower than that for ADA alone (N/P = 50). This
phenomenon might be that the assembly enriches the quaternary ammonium
chains of ADA together and facilitates the pDNA binding, thus leading
to the enhanced DNA condensation capability. Meanwhile, other information
about the pDNA condensation by the HBCCD–ADA supramolecular
assembly comes from TEM and DLS experiments. The TEM image (Figure S1a) revealed that pDNA was condensed
into even tighter spherical particles with an average diameter of
270 nm at the N/P ratio of 20. The DLS result further indicated that
the HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly could effectively bind
pDNA into uniform nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter centered
at 414 nm (Figure S1b).

supramolecular assembly with pDNA at N/P ratios of 5, 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, and 60 from lane 1 to lane 7, respectively, (c) ADA with pDNA
before (lane1) and after (lane 2) esterolysis at the N/P ratio of
50, (d) HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly with pDNA before
(lane 3) and after (lane 4) esterolysis at the N/P ratio of 20.

Subsequently, the controlled pDNA
release behavior was investigated
by analyzing electrophoretic mobility of supramolecular assembly before
and after hydrolysis of ester group in ADA under aqueous NaOH solution.
As shown in Figure 2c,d, pDNA could be released from ADA and HBCCD–ADA supramolecular
assembly (lane 2 and lane 4) after hydrolysis. This indicated that
ADA and HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly could bind pDNA through
electrostatic interaction before esterolysis (lane 1 and lane 3).
Nevertheless, when the neutral ester group in ADA was hydrolyzed to
a negatively charged carboxyl group, the quaternary amine strand in
ADA changed to a zwitterion structure, which realize pDNA-controlled
binding and release (Scheme S1).

As a consequence of the satisfactory π-stacking interaction,
MTZ was chosen as a model anticancer drug and loaded onto the surface
of coronene (Scheme S2).33 As expected, a new shoulder band at 609 and 660 nm was
observed in the UV/vis spectrum of MTZ@HBCCD–ADA (Figure 3), which was assigned
to the characteristic absorption of MTZ.34 Meanwhile, the MTZ-loaded solution (MTZ@HBCCD–ADA) turns
to light blue compared with the pale yellow MTZ-unloaded solution
(Figure 3, inset).
By monitoring the UV/vis spectrum of MTZ at 609 nm, the photometric
standard curve of MTZ was measured (Figure S2). Therefore, the encapsulation and loading efficiency of MTZ by
HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly was calculated to be 32.74
and 4.76%, respectively. In addition, with the gradual addition of
MTZ, the fluorescence intensity of HBCCD–ADA assembly gradually
decreased (Figure S3). The efficiency of
fluorescence quenching was calculated to be 36.3%, which may originate
from π-stacking between MTZ and HBCCD, and then result in the
photo-induced electron transfer process. Moreover, the TEM image in Figure S4a indicated that the MTZ@HBCCD–ADA
assembly still exists in the spherical morphology with a diameter
of 260 nm, and the DLS results revealed a narrow size distribution
of ca. 380 nm accordingly (Figure S4b).
These results demonstrated that the anticancer drug MTZ was loaded
on the HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly efficiently. Subsequently,
the releasing behavior of MTZ from HBCCD–ADA supramolecular
assembly was investigated in physiological environments (0.01 M PBS,
37 °C) at pH 5.7 (the endosomal pH of a cancer cell) and pH 7.2
(physiological pH). As shown in Figure S5, the MTZ@HBCCD–ADA displayed a controlled and sustained release
of MTZ, and the release efficiency of MTZ from MTZ@HBCCD–ADA
was much faster at pH 5.7. The low cumulative release of MTZ probably
because the release process is a dynamic equilibrium process, which
results in the drug not being released completely. This pH responsive
releasing behavior could definitely improve the cytotoxic efficiency
to cancer cells and reduce the toxicity to normal tissues. It is reported
that MTZ hydrochloride is hydrophilic because of the two positively
charged nitrogen atoms, the acidity of protonated MTZ is reduced in
the hydrophobic environment of assembly and pack more closely, which
would prolong the circulation time and favor its stability and biocompatibility
of the drug under the cellular environment.35 In addition, free MTZ is too hydrophilic to penetrate into the lipid
bilayer of the cell membrane, while the assembly can carry drug into
cells through endocytosis. These advantages jointly demonstrate that
the assembly could be used as a safe and promising candidate for drug
delivery systems.

Figure 3 UV/vis absorption of HBCCD–ADA and MTZ@HBCCD–ADA,
respectively. Inset: Color change of unloaded HBCCD–ADA assembly
(left) compared with MTZ-loaded HBCCD–ADA assembly (right).

Next, cytotoxicity experiments
were performed to evaluate the anticancer
activity of MTZ@HBCCD–ADA supramolecular assembly in vitro.
As shown in Figure S6, the half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of MTZ and MTZ@HBCCD–ADA toward
HCT-116 human colon cancer cells were measured as 2.2236 and 2.04 μM by the MTT assay, which indicated
the enhanced anticancer activity of MTZ@HBCCD–ADA assembly.
In addition, after a 24 h incubation, the MTZ@HBCCD–ADA assembly
exhibited satisfactory malignant cell inhibition effect toward the
HCT-116 cell line with a relative cellular viability of 43.7% (Figure S7a), which was slightly lower than that
of commercial anticancer drug MTZ (49.1%); this might be attributed
to the assembly that was preferably internalized in HCT-116 cells
through the endocytosis. The side effects of MTZ@HBCCD–ADA
assembly were also tested by using NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast
cells. As shown in Figure S7b, MTZ@HBCCD–ADA
assembly gave a relative cellular viability as 56.5%, which was slightly
higher than that with free MTZ. Moreover, it is also noteworthy that
HBCCD–ADA assembly was nontoxic to all the examined cell lines
because of its good biocompatibility. These results indicated that
the supramolecular assembly could facilitate the selective and accumulation
of MTZ in cancer cells, which holds great promise to present a safe
and effective tool for cancer therapy. Similar results were also observed
at 48 h of incubation (Figure S8). Afterward,
we investigated the intracellular fluorescence imaging ability of
the conjugated supramolecular assembly. As shown in Figure 4, HCT-116 cells gave a green
fluorescence in cytoplasm after a 24 h incubation with HBCCD–ADA
fluorescence supramolecular assembly. Besides, late endosomes and
lysosomes were stained with Lysotracker Red for colocalizing assembly.37 As shown in Figure S9, high colocalization was observed for HBCCD–ADA assembly,
suggesting that the assembly was successfully internalized into cells,
which might have a potential application value in cancer diagnosis.

Figure 4 Confocal
fluorescence images of HCT-116 cells incubated with HBCCD–ADA
for 24 h. The nucleus was stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
dihydrochloride hydrate (DAPI).

Moreover, the real-time cellular uptake of assembly was evaluated
by confocal laser scanning microscopy during the incubation from 2
to 6 h. As shown in Figure S10, green fluorescence
can be observed at 2 h, and the green fluorescent intensities increased
with time, indicating that the assembly has entered the cells. This
phenomenon validated that the assembly could act as a fluorescence
probe to monitor the distribution, accumulation, and real-time drug
release. After verifying the internalization of HBCCD–ADA assembly,
we continued to investigate the pathway of cellular internalization
with confocal laser scanning microscopy. First, we examined the cellular
uptake of assembly at 4 and 37 °C (Figure S11). At the lower temperature, the cellular uptake ability
weakened, indicating an energy-dependent process in the cellular internalization.
In order to further understand which of the energy-dependent processes
involved in the internalization of assembly, we performed the cellular
uptake treated with two types of biochemical inhibitors, that is,
NaN3/2-deoxyglucose (NaN3/DOG) was utilized
to inhibit the energy-dependent pathway and sucrose was used to perturb
clathrin-mediated endocytosis.37,38 As shown in Figure S11, compared with control, the cells
treated with inhibitors exhibited dramatic decrease in the cellular
uptake of assembly. Thus, we deduced that the internalization of assembly
might be via multiple endocytic pathways.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully constructed a fluorescent supramolecular
assembly composed of doubly positively charged ADA with β-CD
modified HBCCD as a multifunctional supramolecular platform for controlled
DNA condensation, cell imaging, and drug delivery via host–guest
inclusion complexation of ADA with β-CD and further π-stacking
of coronene with anticancer drug MTZ. After the ester group in ADA
was hydrolyzed to a negative carboxyl, the positively charged quaternary
ammine strand converted into a zwitterion structure, which realized
the controlled binding and release of pDNA. Moreover, cytotoxicity
experiments indicated that the assembly displayed a slightly higher
inhibition effect and a lower toxicity than free drug. Besides, because
of the coronene intrinsic fluorescence properties, it has potential
application as cell imaging agent. Considering the facile synergetic
interaction in the design of macrocycle-based assembly, we envision
that the constructed multifunctional assembly can be further functionalized
easily by chemical modification of other guest molecules, thus providing
us a facile modular approach for supramolecular cancer therapy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Methods
All chemicals were
of reagent grade unless noted. HBCCD was synthesized according to
our reported method,25 and ADA was synthesized
according to the reported method.30 NIH3T3
mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line and HCT-116 human colon cancer
cell line were obtained from China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource.
The absorbance spectra were recorded in a conventional quartz cell
(light path 10 mm) by using a UV/vis spectrophotometer (U-2900, Hitachi).
Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in a conventional
quartz cell (10 × 10 × 45 mm) on a fluorescence spectrometer
(Fluorolog-MAX 4, Horiba). TEM images were acquired by an FEI Tecnai
G2 F20 transmission electron microscope. The samples were
prepared by placing a drop of solution onto a carbon-coated copper
grid and air-dried. The SEM images were recorded on a JSM-6700F scanning
electronic microscope. The DLS and zeta potentials were recorded on
Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire,
UK). Gel electrophoresis experiments were measured on a 1% (w/v) agarose
gel at 60 V for 45 min and photographed using a UV transilluminator
and a WD-9415B gel documentation system (Beijing Liuyi Instrument
Factory, P. R. China). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed
on a fluorescence inverted microscope (Zeiss LSM 800).

4.2 Preparation of HBCCD–ADA Supramolecular
Assemblies
ADA was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water
to prepare a stock solution with the concentration of 2 mM, and HBCCD
was dissolved in 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain a stock solution
with the [CD] concentration of 4 mM. The stock solution ADA was diluted
20 folds to 0.1 mM. Upon sonication, the HBCCD solution (0.5 mL) was
slowly added into the diluted ADA solution (19.5 mL) over 5 min. The
resulting HBCCD–ADA solution was stored at 4 °C.

4.3 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Experiments
The controlled
condensation ability of assembly to pDNA was measured
by evaluating the electrophoretic mobility on the agarose gel at different
N/P ratios. The gel electrophoresis experiments were performed in
TAE (0.04 M Tris, 0.02 M acetic acid, and 2.0 mM EDTA) buffer at 25
°C. After samples loading and electrophoresis process, pDNA bands
were stained in Gen Green solution and were photographed using UV

of HBCCD–ADA assembly, and the obtained mixture was stirred
overnight at room temperature in dark for 12 h. The resulting solution
was dialyzed against deionized water for 2 h, and the deionized water
was replaced every 0.5 h. Then, the mixture was freeze-dried. The
drug loading efficiency and encapsulation of MTZ onto HBCCD–ADA
were estimated by the following equations    

4.5 MTZ Releasing in Vitro
The release
of MTZ from HBCCD–ADA in vitro was investigated using the dialysis
method in PBS buffer (pH 5.7 and 7.2, I = 0.01 M)
at 37 °C. The solution of 2 mL MTZ@HBCCD–ADA was placed
into a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut off 500 and dialyzed
against 30 mL PBS buffer with stirring. At certain intervals, 2 mL
of dialysate was taken out and an equal volume of PBS buffer was added.
The amount of released MTZ was analyzed by the absorbance of MTZ at
609 nm. This experiment was performed in three groups, and the data
were presented as the mean ± standard deviation.

line was cultured in the McCoy’s 5A medium, and both of the
medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells
and HCT-116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/mL, 100 μL per well) for 24 h; then, the cells were
incubated with MTZ, MTZ@HBCCD–ADA, HBCCD–ADA, HBCCD,
and ADA for 24 and 48 h, respectively. The relative cellular viability
of the cells was determined by the MTT assay.

Furthermore, the
IC50 values of MTZ and MTZ@HBCCD–ADA toward HCT-116 cell line

were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After that, the cell
nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 μg/mL) for 5 min and observed
by a confocal laser scanning microscope. In order to evaluate the
location of assembly in cells, late endosomes and lysosomes were stained
with Lysotracker Red at 200 nM for 30 min after incubation with cells.

4.8 Cellular Uptake of the HBCCD–ADA Supramolecular
Assembly
