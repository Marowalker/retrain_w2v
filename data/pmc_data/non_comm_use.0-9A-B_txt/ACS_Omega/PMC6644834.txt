Here, we use a simple
and effective method to accomplish energy level alignment and thus
electron injection barrier control in organic light emitting diodes
(OLEDs) with a conventional architecture based on a green emissive
copolymer. In particular, a series of functionalized zinc porphyrin
compounds bearing π-delocalized triazine electron withdrawing
spacers for efficient intramolecular electron transfer and different
terminal groups such as glycine moieties in their peripheral substitutes
are employed as thin interlayers at the emissive layer/Al (cathode)
interface to realize efficient electron injection/transport. The effects
of spatial (i.e., assembly) configuration, molecular dipole moment
and type of peripheral group termination on the optical properties
and energy level tuning are investigated by steady-state and time-resolved
photoluminescence spectroscopy in F8BT/porphyrin films, by photovoltage
measurements in OLED devices and by surface work function measurements
in Al electrodes modified with the functionalized zinc porphyrins.
The performance of OLEDs is significantly improved upon using the
functionalized porphyrin interlayers with the recorded luminance of
the devices to reach values 1 order of magnitude higher than that
of the reference diode without any electron injection/transport interlayer.

1 Introduction
Three
decades after the first publications on electroluminescence obtained
in organic semiconductor heterojunctions,1,2 several
products based on organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have already
entered the market. Although OLEDs represent a mature technology,
they continue to attract wide scientific attention because of their
potential to find more applications especially as next generation
flat panel lighting sources, having the advantages of low voltage, high
brightness and efficiency, solution processing, low fabrication cost
and flexibility.3−5 The efficiency of OLEDs strongly depends on the balanced
charge injection, transport, and recombination of both electrons and
holes, as well as on efficient exciton decay and light extraction
processes. Because low work function (WF) metals such as calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), and magnesium (Mg) strongly
degrade in the presence of oxygen and moisture,6 aluminum (Al), despite its relatively high WF of ∼4.1–4.3 eV, is widely applied as a
cathode electrode material because of its high ambient stability and
ease of processing.7 However, the relatively
large WF of Al in combination with the
generally low electron affinity of most organic semiconductors
results in a significant electron injection barrier formed between
the Al cathode and organic semiconductors commonly used as the emissive
layer (EML) of OLEDs. A vast number of approaches have been applied
to reduce the electron injection barrier, thus improving the charge
balance and enhancing the OLED efficiency. In particular, interfacial
materials such as dipolar molecules,8−10 sulfonium salts,11 polyoxometalates,12,13 ionic liquids,14 conjugated polyelectrolytes,15−19 and self-assembled monolayers20−22 are inserted
between the Al cathode and the EML in the form of thin interlayers
to facilitate electron injection toward the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of the organic semiconductor used in the EML.

On the other hand, porphyrins, among other materials, are considered
as ideal building blocks for future electronic devices because they
exhibit several desirable functionalities such as strong visible absorption
and high chemical stability as well as ultrafast charge transport
and long exciton diffusion length due to their extended
conjugation and π-electron delocalization.23−28 Metallated and free-base porphyrin compounds have been applied as
visible light absorbers in dye-sensitized and organic solar cells.29−31 They have been also proven promising as  charge transport
materials in the emerging technology of perovskite solar cells.32−35 Recently, our group and others reported the utilization of thin
porphyrin layers in organic solar cells with both the conventional
and the inverted architectures to promote electron extraction toward
the cathode.36−38 However, in the field of OLEDs, works on the electron
injection capability of porphyrins are limited to that previously
reported by our group, which demonstrated that appropriately oriented
aggregated nanostructures of the free-base and zinc-metallated meso-tetrakis
(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin chloride can improve the energy
level alignment at the cathode interface, increase electron injection
and transport rates, and enhance the efficiency of OLEDs.39

In the current work, we use four different
zinc porphyrin compounds as thin interlayers between the EML and the
Al cathode in OLED devices with the conventional configuration. These
porphyrins are appropriately functionalized in order to exhibit high
molecular dipole moments and controllable assembly configuration compared
to the reference compound with no peripheral groups. The insertion
of these functionalized porphyrin interlayers induces the formation
of large negative interfacial dipoles, thus reducing the electron
injection barrier at the EML/Al cathode interface. As a result, OLEDs
using poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-2,1′,3-thiadiazole)]
(F8BT, with a 9:1 F8:BT ratio) as the EML and the functionalized porphyrins
as thin cathode interlayers exhibited up to a 10-fold improvement
in the device luminance compared to the reference device with an Al
cathode.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Design
Rules for Porphyrin Compounds
The design of functionalized
porphyrin compounds was accomplished under the requirement of facilitating
efficient electron transfer toward the EML (F8BT). We, therefore,
started by adding to the simple reference compound [5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-porphyrinato]
zinc(II) (ZnTPP) an electron withdrawing group such as
a triazine moiety,40 in order to facilitate
intramolecular electron transfer to the porphyrin ring through the
polarizable π-electron density of triazine.41 We thus obtained the {5-[(4-(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino)phenyl]-10,15,20-triphenyl-porphyrinato}zinc(II)
(ZnTPP-cc). Next, the triazine moiety was substituted
either by a glycine group (NH2–CH2–COOH)
leading to {5-[4-((carboxymethyl)amino)-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino)phenyl]-10,15,20-triphenyl-porphyrinato}
zinc(II) (ZnTPP-cc-gly) or by two glycine groups leading
to {5-[4,6-(bis-(carboxymethyl)amino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino)phenyl]-10,15,20-triphenyl-porphyrinato}
zinc(II) (ZnTPP-cc-gly2). The
addition of the hydrophilic glycine moieties was performed in order
to allow controlled spatial configuration of the porphyrin molecules
having −COOH end groups which are expected to orient with their
hydrophilic side away from the hydrophobic organic semiconducting
underlayer. The chemical structures of the porphyrin compounds are
shown in Figure 1 (upper
part), while their synthetic procedure (Figure S1) along with details on the synthesis is presented in Supporting Information.

optimized ground state geometries, and the corresponding dipole moments
(absolute values and direction of the corresponding vectors) of (a) ZnTPP, (b) ZnTPP-cc, (c) ZnTPP-cc-gly, and (d) ZnTPP-cc-gly2.

2.2 Theoretical
Study
We next performed theoretical calculations using the
Gaussian 09 computational package.42 The
optimized ground state geometries and the corresponding dipole moments
of the four porphyrin compounds are presented in Figure 1. It is observed that the porphyrin
ring remains planar without any distortion in the ground state, while
the four phenyl rings orient themselves perpendicular to the porphyrin
ring plane. The molecular dipole moment μ(D) of the parent compound ZnTPP was found to be as low
as 0.07 D because of its highly symmetric structure. The functionalized
porphyrin with the triazine moiety (ZnTPP-cc) exhibits
a higher μ(D) = 4.4698 D, which is further
increased to 5.2429 D and 4.9865 D for ZnTPP-cc-gly and ZnTPP-cc-gly2, respectively, bearing
the glycine group(s). The significant magnitude of μ(D) exhibited by the triazine-functionalized porphyrins combined
with its favorable orientation could beneficially affect the interfacial
electron injection barrier by lowering the WF at the EML/porphyrin/Al interface.43

The electron density plots of the two highest occupied (HOMOs)
and the two lowest unoccupied (LUMOs) molecular orbitals (MOs) involved
in the first allowed transitions of each porphyrin molecule are given
in Figure 2. The relevant
excited states in all porphyrin-type systems are multireference and
four MOs, two HOMOs (HOMO - 1, HOMO) and two LUMOs (LUMO, LUMO + 1),
are involved for the description of the lowest excited states and
transitions between them. It is observed that, although HOMO –
1 plots are localized on the porphyrin ring, HOMO plots have a significant
contribution from the Zn atom, which is in accordance with results
reported by others.44 LUMO plots have significant
density on the porphyrin rings with no contribution from Zn atoms.
The energies of the MOs of the designed porphyrins compounds were
calculated and are also included in Figure 2. From these values, it becomes evident that
glycine substitution has no profound effect on the optical properties
of porphyrin compounds. The same conclusion can be drawn from the
theoretically calculated excited states and transition dipole moments
of those compounds (Figures S2–S5).

(a) ZnTPP, (b) ZnTPP-cc, (c) ZnTPP-cc-gly, and (d) ZnTPP-cc-gly2. The
energies of the corresponding MOs are also shown.

2.3 Optical Properties and Assembly Configurations
The absorption spectra of porphyrin compounds in methanol solutions
(10–5 M) are presented in Figure 3a. All compounds display a qualitatively
similar spectral shape with three well-resolved spectral bands. The
short wavelength intense Soret band appears at 422 nm and is attributed
to the S0 to S2 transition, while the two weaker
Q bands appear at 558 and 598 nm.45 The
latter are characteristic absorption bands of zinc porphyrin compounds
and correspond to S0 to S1 transitions.46,47 The inset in Figure 3a shows a magnification of the Q-band absorption region. Passing
from solution to solid state, the Soret and Q absorption bands of
porphyrin films obtained via spin coating 1 mg mL–1 methanol solutions on quartz substrates are red-shifted with respect
to those of their solution spectra (Figure 3b). The red shift of the Soret band of ZnTPP is quite modest, while the overall intensity of the
peaks is low compared to the functionalized compounds. Furthermore,
the spectra of the functionalized porphyrins (especially of ZnTPP-cc) reveal a pronounced broadening of the Soret absorption
band, exhibiting a tail toward long wavelengths. This is an indication
for the formation of J-aggregates in the solid state;48 such aggregates are considered beneficial for electron
transport.49 Moreover, the emission of
porphyrin compounds in methanol solutions and in films was investigated
by recording steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. In solutions
(Figure 3c), the two
characteristics bands of zinc porphyrins appear in all cases at 605
and 655 nm.50 However, a significant
quenching of the PL intensity, especially in the case of the functionalized
porphyrins, is observed in the solid state (Figure 3d). These findings indicate efficient π–π
stacking of the functionalized porphyrins upon self-assembly in the
solid state. In the functionalized derivatives, coordination of Zn
metal center of one molecule with carbonyl oxygen (as illustrated
in Figure 3e in the
representative example of the possible assembly configuration of ZnTPP-cc-gly2)50 or triazine nitrogen of another molecule may contribute
to π–π stacking. In addition, chlorine and carboxylic
acid of the peripheral groups may play a vital role in the assembly
configuration by forming halogen or hydrogen bonds, respectively.51,52 In this manner, a continuous network (thin film) is formed upon
the π–π stacking of individual molecules of the
functionalized compounds. Note that such π–π stacking
results in a significant degree of electron delocalization through
extended π-orbital overlap, which is beneficial for electron
injection/transport.53

porphyrin (a) solutions in methanol (10–5 M) (the
inset shows the magnified Q-bands region) and (b) thin films
on quartz substrates. Steady-state PL spectra of porphyrin (c) solutions

(e) A possible network formed via self-assembly of ZnTPP-cc-gly2 molecules in the solid state. (f) Absorption
spectra of F8BT films (on ITO/glass substrates) without and with porphyrin
layers atop. The PL spectra of the same films are shown as inset.

Next, we verified that the functionalized
porphyrins can form a continuous film when deposited on top of F8BT
used as the EML in OLEDs. In Figure 3f, the UV–vis absorption spectra of F8BT without
and with porphyrins spin-coated from 0.5 mg mL–1 solutions are presented. In all spectra, a pronounced peak at 376
nm is evident, which is attributed to F8BT absorption.53 Upon deposition of the functionalized porphyrin
compounds, a small but clearly visible peak appears at 436 nm corresponding
to the Soret band of the porphyrins. This peak is absent in the case
of the ZnTPP, which indicates the failure to obtain a
homogeneous film upon effective π–π stacking of
individual molecules when using the compound with no peripheral groups.
The optical microscopy image of a ZnTPP layer reveals
the tendency of the specific porphyrin compound to form large clusters
rather than a continuous film (Figure S6), which is not the case for that is ZnTPP-cc-gly2 (which is also shown in Figure S6 for comparison). This observation suggests that
porphyrin functionalization with appropriate moieties is imperative
in order to obtain homogeneous and continuous networks formed via
π–π stacking of individual porphyrin molecules
atop of organic semiconductors to allow for efficient electron injection/transport
from the cathode electrode. The formation of a thin film of functionalized
porphyrins atop F8BT was also indicated by the change in topography
and decrease of the surface root-mean-square roughness as verified
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images shown in Figure S7. Note that the PL spectra of the same films (Figure 3f, inset) exhibited
one broad peak at 530 nm which is assigned to F8BT’s emission
with no contribution from porphyrin thin overlayers, which clearly
indicates that the primary role of porphyrins in our devices is to
transfer electrons and not to emit (or absorb) light.

2.4 Control of the Electron Injection Barrier
Figure 4a shows the  structure of
the fabricated OLEDs, which consist of indium tin oxide (ITO) as the
transparent anode electrode, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT–PSS) as the hole transport layer, and F8BT
as the EML. In some devices, an Al contact was directly deposited
on top of F8BT to serve as the top cathode electrode (reference devices),
while in others a thin porphyrin interlayer was inserted between F8BT
and Al to modify the cathode interface and facilitate electron injection/transport.

various porphyrin interlayers. (c) Work function as derived from CPD
of pristine and porphyrin-coated aluminum samples and (d) illustration
of energy diagram at the cathode interface of OLEDs upon porphyrin
modification.

To support the argument
that the insertion of porphyrin interlayer at the cathode side of
the device may result in the alteration of the energetics at the polymer/Al
interface, we performed photovoltaic measurements in order to directly
probe the open circuit voltage (Voc) of
OLEDs without and with porphyrin modification. The value of Voc in a diode is generally related to the built-in
potential generated upon contact of the organic emissive layer
with the modified electrodes.54 Current
density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded under illumination with AM 1.5 simulated
light (1 sun or ∼100 mW cm–2). The results
are shown in Figure 4b. It is observed that the measured Voc values present a pronounced enhancement upon device modification
with the functionalized porphyrins. In particular, the reference device
with an Al cathode shows a Voc of
∼0.55 V, which is modestly increased to 0.60 and 0.70 V upon
the insertion of ZnTPP and ZnTPP-cc, respectively.
This increase becomes more pronounced upon modification with ZnTPP-cc-gly (∼1.15 V) and ZnTPP-cc-gly2 (∼1.10 V), which is attributed to
an enhancement in the device built-in potential and is suggestive
of a decrease in the effective WF of the
porphyrin-modified Al electrode, thus resulting in a significant reduction
of the electron injection barrier up to ∼0.60 eV.

To
directly characterize the change in WF of Al upon porphyrin modification, we evaluated the surface WF of Al and porphyrin-modified Al films by measuring
the contact potential difference (CPD) (Figure 4c). In agreement with the enhanced Voc in the porphyrin-modified OLEDs, porphyrin
deposition on Al gradually reduced the surface WF to 4.01, 3.89, 3.74, and 3.71 eV (WF of Al = 4.04 eV) upon coating with ZnTPP, ZnTPP-cc, ZnTPP-cc-gly, and ZnTPP-cc-gly2, respectively. This WF decrease is attributed to a downward shift of the vacuum
level upon inserting a thin porphyrin interlayer on Al film because
of the generation of a negative dipole and a local electric field
as illustrated in Figure 4d. This shift is more pronounced in the samples with the glycine-bearing
functionalized porphyrins and can be attributed to one or to a combination
of the following mechanisms/processes: (i) a rearrangement of charge
in the metal underneath the porphyrin adsorbate resulting in a local
net charge induced electric field.55 (ii)
A synergistic effect arising from the presence of the molecular (i.e.,
porphyrin) dipole along the direction perpendicular to the surface
and an interface dipole formed at the interface between the porphyrin
and Al that is partially attributed to spontaneous interfacial electron
transfer. (iii) Dipolar polarization due to the spontaneous adsorption
of the carboxylic acid groups onto the metal surface. (iv) In the
case of carboxylic acid-bearing porphyrins, oxidation of Al to Al2O3 at the interface can occur, thus reducing the WF in the oxidized interface.56,57 (v) Similarly, for the compounds bearing chlorine ions, spatial
separation of these ions probably induces a chemical reaction with
Al and reducing the WF at the interface
as in the case of LiF/Al interfaces.58,59 We also note
that a critical parameter for the effective contribution of some the
aforementioned mechanisms (mechanisms ii–iv) in the reduction
of the porphyrin-modified Al interface work function is the orientation
of the porphyrin molecules on the surface upon stacking. For example,
in our previous work, we found a stronger electric field interface
dipole when molecules adopt the face-on rather than the edge-on orientation.39 Herein, we propose that the hydrophilic carboxylic
acid groups are likely oriented toward the surface of Al, whereas
the hydrophobic porphyrin ring is oriented toward F8BT resulting in
a higher hydrophilicity of the F8BT/functionalized porphyrin surfaces
relative to pristine F8BT and F8BT/ZnTPP ones (Figure S8 and Table S1). Therefore, mechanisms (ii) and (iii) may act cooperatively and
contribute to the observed work function reduction. In any case, to
unravel the exact mechanism for the formation of a negative dipole
at the porphyrin/Al interface is beyond the scope of this work, which
emphasizes that with appropriate functionalization of porphyrin compounds
fine tuning of the interfacial electron injection barrier of OLEDs
can be successfully achieved.

2.5 Emission
Quenching Studies
It is well known that in the case of OLEDs
the emission efficiency is limited by exciton quenching at charge
injection interfaces.60 Steady-state and
transient PL decay traces for thin F8BT films (∼10 nm, of the
order of the exciton diffusion length) deposited on nonquenching (glass)
and quenching (Al) substrates without and with thick porphyrin interlayers
deposited via drop-casting 2 mg mL–1 solutions are
shown in Figure 5.
It is evident in Figure 5a that the PL emission of F8BT on glass is suppressed upon the insertion
of porphyrin interlayers due to a reduction of the exciton density
decaying in the F8BT layer as excitons diffuse toward the porphyrin-modified
interface. The same conclusion can be drawn from time-resolved PL
(TRPL) traces shown in Figure 5c. Upon fitting the results with multi-exponential curves,
we obtain the average lifetime ⟨τ⟩ in each case
(Table 1). A pronounced
decrease in ⟨τ⟩ witnesses the electron accepting
character of porphyrins. This is particularly evident for the glycine
substituted porphyrins, where a decrease of the F8BT PL lifetime by
a factor of 2 is observed because of their stronger electron accepting
nature. Moreover, a new decay channel is observed with the glycine-substituted
porphyrins, as manifested by the appearance of a third, very short,
(∼0.3 ns) lifetime component with an almost 30% contribution
to the overall lifetime, which is not present in the reference and
the other two porphyrin-modified glass/F8BT interfaces. We attribute
this component to the emergence of a fast F8BT exciton decay/dissociation
process, likely assisted by exciton diffusion/transfer toward the
modified interface. This exciton lifetime reduction combined with
the PL spectra suppression is rather surprising because the estimated
LUMO of these compounds lies above that of F8BT (∼3.3 eV).61 However, our previous studies demonstrated that
a large vacuum level shift toward lower values occurs upon depositing
a thin porphyrin layer on top of F8BT.39 This should result in a significant lowering of their LUMO relative
to that of F8BT and could offer a viable explanation for the exciton
quenching occurring at the porphyrin/F8BT interface but further investigation
is needed, which, however, is beyond the scope of the present work.
Exciton quenching due to direct energy transfer to the porphyrins
would not be expected to play a role in the devices as there is a
minimal overlap between the emission spectrum of F8BT (530 nm) and
the Soret (about 430 nm in the solid state) bands of porphyrins,
while their Q-bands have negligible intensity in the solid state.
For the samples with the ZnTPP and ZnTPP-cc films, weak PL originating by the porphyrins is observed (Figure 5a). However, this
cannot be attributed to energy transfer from F8BT to the porphyrins
but to direct excitation, because if energy transfer occurred, then
the quenching of F8BT and the reduction of its lifetime would be more
pronounced in the samples with ZnTPP and ZnTPP-cc porphyrins.

Al/ZnTPP-cc-gly2/F8BT	51	0.15	36	0.65	13	1.56	0.51	0.9533	
A different picture
is obtained when F8BT is deposited on quenching Al substrates. As
expected, the estimated exciton average lifetime ⟨τ⟩
is much lower than that obtained for the glass substrate (0.53 ns
for F8BT on Al substrate versus 2.42 ns for F8BT on glass substrate, Figure 5d and Table 1), which we attribute to quenching
due to non-radiative energy transfer via long range dipole interaction
and decay of F8BT excitons generated close to the interface with Al.
However, a very small additional decrease of lifetime is observed
upon inserting the functionalized porphyrins and especially those
with the glycine group(s), while the decrease was more significant
when inserting the symmetric porphyrin compounds (ZnTPP). This phenomenon qualitatively agrees with the steady state
spectra detected on Al substrate (Figure 5b) and implies that the use of functionalized
porphyrins (especially of those bearing carboxylic acid groups) even
though does not suppress the interaction between the organic semiconductor
and the cathode electrode which causes the undesirable quenching and
cannot act as effective exciton blocking (i.e., spacer) layers,62 results in only a slight additional quenching
effect due to the porphyrins’ electron accepting nature. We
also note that other parameters such as molecular orientation and
alignment of the transition dipole moments of the porphyrin molecules
may influence the exciton dissociation/charge transfer process when
deposited on a metal and a dielectric substrate, as likely suggested
by the different F8BT exciton quenching behavior for the various porphyrins
on the two substrates.

2.6 Characteristics of OLEDs
Using Porphyrin Interlayers
Finally, the influence of the
insertion of thin porphyrin films into the device to serve as electron
injection and transport interlayers on the current density–voltage
(J–V) and luminance–voltage
(L–V) characteristics of
the OLEDs shown in Figure 4a is depicted in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The devices operational characteristics
are also summarized in Table 2. It is observed that the porphyrin-modified devices exhibit
a large increase in both current density and luminance and a significant
decrease in the turn-on (at L ≈ 10 cd m–2) and operational (at L ≈
1000 cd m–2) voltages compared to the reference
device with an Al cathode. The highest J and L values were obtained for the devices with the ZnTPP-cc-gly (250.0 mA cm–2, 13702.4 cd m–2) and ZnTPP-cc-gly2 (256.9 mA
cm–2, 16693.8 cd m–2). The latter
case represents an increase by a factor more than 3 for the current
density and 10 for the luminance compared to the reference device
(70.7 mA cm–2, 1555.5 cd m–2).
Note that the luminance values obtained in the devices using glycine-modified
porphyrins are significantly higher compared to the devices with ZnTPP and ZnTPP-cc  due to the superior
electron injection properties arising from the reduced electron injection
barrier, the likely enhanced electron transport and the
negligible additional quenching effect of glycine-based porphyrins,
as compared to the other two compounds. As a result, the luminous
efficiency (LE) and power efficiency (PE) were significantly increased
upon cathode modification with the functionalized porphyrins
(Figure 6c and Table 2), strongly suggesting
that an improved electron injection/transport primarily due to
a decrease of the energy barrier is achieved upon modifying
the F8BT/Al interface with a very thin porphyrin layer. It should
be also mentioned that upon insertion of porphyrin interlayers at
the F8BT/Al interface there was no change in the device electroluminescence
(EL) spectra (Figure 6d). The EL spectra of the reference devices and the porphyrin-modified
OLEDs exhibit a broad peak at around 530 nm, characteristic of emission
from the F8BT copolymer, suggesting that recombination and emission
take place exclusively inside the active layer. We note that the achieved
efficiency values (i.e., LE equal to 7.30 cd A–1 for ZnTPP-cc-gly2-modified
OLED) are among the highest ever reported for similar OLED configurations
(i.e., with a conventional architecture using a 70 nm thick F8BT EML
and an Al cathode). For instance, when using an ultrathin LiF cathode
interlayer63 or a Ca cathode,64 luminous efficiencies of the order of 7.0 cd
A–1 have also been reported. It is worth noting,
however, that Friend et al. have previously reported that optimized
OLEDs with an inverted configuration can be made to exhibit LEs of
more than 20 cd A–1 by controlling the width of

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a series of functionalized zinc-metallated
porphyrins by adding peripheral groups in order to change the molecular
dipole moment and assembly configuration and imlemented them as electron
injection/transport interlayers in F8BT-based OLED devices. The interfacial
energy level alignment at the cathode interface was investigated in
detail, revealing that upon modification with the functionalized porphyrins
a significant reduction in the electron injection barrier occurs.
With regard to the mechanism for interfacial energy level tuning,
the formation of a negative interface dipole probably via spontaneous
interfacial electron transfer and dipolar polarization of porphyrin
compounds are more likely. In addition, the functionalized compounds
have no undesirable effect on the emission quenching at the F8BT/Al
interface as revealed by time-resolved spectroscopy. Porphyrin interlayer
incorporation significantly improved the OLED performance as
manifested by the reduction of turn-on and operational voltage and
the increase of the maximum luminous/power efficiency and luminance.
This work demonstrates a simple, solution-based strategy to modulate
the interfacial  energy level alignment and electron injection/transport
in OLEDs by using appropriately functionalized porphyrin compounds,
paving the way for their implementation in other organic/inorganic optoelectronic
devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Quantum
Chemical Calculations
Calculations were performed using the
G09 computational package and the DFT and TD-DFT methods. Two functionals
were employed, the B3LYP for optimizing geometries and calculating
the excited states at the absorption geometries. The 6-31G(d,p) basis
set was used for the calculations.

4.2 Device
Preparation
ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance
of 20 Ω/sq, which served as anode electrodes were used for OLED
device fabrication. The substrates were subsequently cleaned in acetone,
2-propanol, and DI water under sonication for 10 min at room temperature
and dried with N2 after each bath, respectively. Next,
the substrates were treated with O2 plasma for 10 min.
Afterward, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT–PSS) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (1.3 wt % dispersion
in H2O) was filtered with a 0.45 μm PVDF filter,
spin-coated on the substrates at ambient conditions (at 7000 rpm for
40 s to form a 40 nm thick layer), and annealed for 1 h at 100 °C
on a hotplate. The EML was the green-yellow copolymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)]
(F8BT, with a 9:1 F8:BT ratio), purchased from American Dyes Source
(ADS 233 YE). It was spin-coated (at 1200 rpm for 40 s to form a 70
nm thick layer) from a 10 mg mL–1 solution in chloroform
(after it was previously filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size
PTFE filter) on top of PEDOT–PSS at ambient conditions. After
deposition, the F8BT film was annealed at 95 °C for 10 min on
a hotplate. Then, in some devices, a thin porphyrin film was deposited
on top of a F8BT layer via spin coating (at 2000 rpm for 40 s) from
a methanolic solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1 to serve as the electron injector/transport layer. The devices were
completed with a 150 nm aluminum cathode deposited through a shadow
mask in a dedicated chamber.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
Current density–voltage characteristics were measured with
a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. Luminance and electroluminescence
(EL) spectra were recorded with an Ocean Optics USB2000 fiber optic
spectrophotometer, assuming a Lambertian emission profile (for luminance
measurements). All measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
Absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The CPD has been evaluated with a single-point
Kelvin Probe system (KP010) under ambient conditions. The surface
morphology of films was investigated with an NT-MDT AFM system operating
in tapping mode. The steady-state PL spectra were recorded by a FluoroMax-4
(Horiba) fluorescence spectrometer. The PL dynamics of the samples
were studied under magic angle conditions, by using a time-correlated
single-photon counting spectrometer (FluoTime, Picoquant) employing
a pulsed diode laser emitting at 470 nm with 60 ps pulse duration
as the excitation source (Picoquant). Detection of the fluorescence
was realized by a microchannel plate photomultiplier at the peaks
of the PL spectra and the instrument’s response function was
∼80 ps. Upon fitting the PL decays with a multi-exponential
function, the lifetimes τi and their
normalized pre-exponential factors Ai were obtained. The PL average (mean) lifetime ⟨τ⟩
was calculated by means of
