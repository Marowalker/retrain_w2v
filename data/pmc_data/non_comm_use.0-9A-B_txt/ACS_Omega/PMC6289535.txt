In
this study, sodium alginate was employed as a starting material
for preparing two kinds of biocompatible adsorbents, including calcium
alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern, and scanning electron
microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray techniques were used to characterize
the prepared adsorbents. The performance of the prepared adsorbents
for the removal of methyl violet from aqueous solution was studied
in detail. Both kinetics and equilibrium aspects of methyl violet
adsorption were investigated, and the obtained equilibrium and kinetics
data were described with various adsorption models. The effects of
initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on adsorption
performance were investigated. Thermodynamic parameters of adsorption
were obtained as well.

1 Introduction
In
the last century, the massive growth of population on one hand
and the rapid industrialization on the other resulted in release of
different pollutants in the environment, including dyes. Dyes are
synthetic compounds which are widely used in cosmetics industry, paper,
plastic, and so on.1,2 Therefore, the wastewater of such
industries contains high concentration of dyes. Discharging of this
wastewater into the water sources reduces water quality and affects
aquatic living organism, damages human health, and aesthetic nature
of the water. Therefore, the removal of synthetic dyes from water
is environmentally important.

Removal of dye compounds from
aqueous solutions has been widely
studied, and several physical and chemical techniques have been proposed
for purification of water from these compounds including photocatalysis,
oxidation, filtration, coagulation–flocculation, ozonation,
and adsorption.3−5 Among all of these techniques, adsorption is considered
as one of the most useful methods for the removal of dyes because
its operation is facile and efficient and the adsorbent can be recovered
and reused.6,7 Dissolved dye molecules can bind to the
surface of the adsorbent by physical or chemical bonds.8

Methyl violet (MV) is one of the poison
dye compounds, which is
used in textile and paper dyeing and so on (the chemical structure
of MV is shown in Figure S1). Various adsorbents
have been applied for the removal of MV from wastewater such as membrane9 waste materials,10 chitosan,11 agricultural waste,12 sepiolite,13 fly
ash,14 perlite,15 and powdered activated carbon.16 However,
most of these adsorbents are neither cost effective nor biodegradable.17,18

To improve these weaknesses, a new class of adsorbents, biopolymer-based
adsorbents, are introduced in water purification applications. In
recent years, many studies have been carried out on using biopolymers
as the adsorbent because of their simple synthesis, environmental
compatibility, biodegradability, and low cost.

Also, these materials
can be modified for specific pollutant removal.19,20 Biopolymers and, in particular, sodium alginate are biodegradable
compounds that have many hydroxyl and carboxylate functional group
in their internal structure.21−23 Therefore, because of the presence
of numerous anionic groups, they can be considered as a new candidate
for the removal of cationic pollutions from waste water (similar to
cationic dyes). Dye adsorption on biopolymer-based adsorbents occurs
through electrostatic attractions between adsorbents and contaminants.24

Sodium alginate, a natural water-soluble
salt of alginic acid,
is a linear polysaccharides that is extracted from brown algae. It
has high bioavailability, and its extraction process is easy. This
natural polymer consists of α-L-guluronic (G) and β-d-mannuronic (M) acid residues (Figure 1), and these produce a variety of sequential
1,4-linkage with other materials. The ability to form hydrogels is
one of the main properties of alginate; this property of sodium alginate
is mainly because of the substitution of sodium ions from the guluronic
acid residues by different divalent cations (Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, etc.). Therefore, a 3D network is formed
as a result of binding divalent cation to the α-l-guluronic
block (and between two different chains) (Figure 1).25,26 Hydrogels of calcium
alginate can be used as a potential sorbent because of its low cost,
hydrophilicity, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of
sodium alginate.

Introducing nanoparticles
into the biopolymer matrices can significantly
improve thermal, chemical, mechanical, and surface properties of biopolymers.27,28 Recently, interests in biopolymer-based metal oxide nanoparticles
have been increased because of biocompatibility, their ability for
the removal of dyes and other containments from water, and so on.

Magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) adsorbents based on iron oxide have
received great attention. This attention is because of the fundamental
properties of MNPs such as particle size and large surface area.29 One of the most important advantages of using
magnetic-based adsorbent is the ease of separation from treated water
through an external magnetic field. This property leads to a possibility
of reusing the adsorbent (and also recovering the adsorbed substrate).30,31 Preparation of nanocomposites of calcium alginate polysaccharides
with iron oxide provides materials which have desired properties of
good adsorbents.26,32

In this study, calcium
alginate and magnetic composite beads were
prepared and used as adsorbents for the removal of MV from aqueous
solution. Adsorption of MV was studied from equilibrium and kinetics
viewpoints. Furthermore, the effect of different parameters including
temperature, adsorbent mass, and initial concentration of MV was studied
too.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Samples
Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the synthesized iron oxide are
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 SEM images
of the synthesized iron oxide with increasing magnification
from (a–d).

Figure 2a,b shows
that the as-synthesized iron oxide structures are microspheres with
a diameter of ≈1.5 μm. Figure 2c shows that each microsphere is composed
of several nanosheets. Figure 2d shows that the nanosheets are formed by aggregation of nanoparticles
(15–20 nm). Figure 3 represents the SEM images of dried magnetic beads. This figure
clearly shows that the iron oxide microparticles were coated with
a thin layer of calcium alginate.

Figure 3 SEM images of dried magnetic beads with
(a) low and (b) high magnifications.

From the results of the EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray) spectra
of
iron oxide (Figure S2a), it can be found
that the synthesized iron oxide is only composed of iron (Fe) and
oxygen (O). Furthermore, the EDX spectrum of the dried magnetic beads
is shown in Figure S2b, which confirms
the presence of oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) elements. Also, the appearance
of C and Ca peaks confirms the presence of calcium alginate layer.

Figure 4 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the dried magnetic composite hydrogel
beads. The XRD pattern shows six characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 at 2θ = 30.1, 35.8, 43.1, 53.9, 57.2, and 63.1°
that can be indexed to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440)
planes of Fe3O4, and a characteristic peak at
2θ = 33.0° that can be assigned to (104) plane of α-Fe2O3. Therefore, from the XRD pattern, it can be
concluded that the synthesized iron oxide is composed of Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3.33,34

Figure 4 XRD
pattern of dried magnetic beads.

The FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrums of calcium
alginate
beads, magnetic calcium alginate beads, MV-loaded calcium alginate
beads, and MV-loaded magnetic calcium alginate beads are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of: (a)
calcium alginate hydrogel beads, (b) MV-loaded
calcium alginate hydrogel beads, (c) magnetic hydrogel beads, and
(d) MV-loaded magnetic hydrogel beads.

In the FTIR spectrum of calcium alginate beads (Figure 5a), the broad peak
at 3452
cm–1 is corresponded to −OH stretching vibration
of calcium alginate, and the peaks at 2926 and 2736 cm–1 belong to symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching, respectively.
The bands which appeared at 1645 and 1423 cm–1 are
assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxyl
groups of calcium alginate, respectively. The band at 1091 cm–1 attributes to C–O–C group. Figure 5c, which is FTIR
spectra of magnetic beads, shows that the band at 3444 cm–1 is because of the −OH stretching and bending vibration and
bands at 1602 and 1409 cm–1 are because of asymmetrical
and symmetrical stretching vibration of carboxyl group for magnetic
beads. Also, the weak band of bending vibration of C–O–C
group is appeared in 1033.07 cm–1.

The absorption
band at the low-frequency zone of 500–700
cm–1 (569 cm–1) corresponds to
the stretching vibration of Fe–O bands in iron oxide and the
FTIR spectrum of calcium alginate beads and magnetic beads after being
loaded with MV. Figure 5b,c shows a shift of the peaks and reduction of peak intensity (especially
significant reduction in −OH and C=O bands). These changes
imply that MV is chemically adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbents.

2.2 Adsorption Kinetics
The study of
adsorption kinetics provides indispensable information about the mechanism
and rate of adsorption. Also, kinetic studies are of prime importance
to design and operate adsorption equipment. Figure 6 shows the changes in adsorbed amounts with
time for both types of adsorbents. This figure clearly shows that
the adsorption of MV by both types of adsorbents is initially fast,
and most of the adsorption occurs within 10 min. Also, it can be seen
that by increasing the initial MV concentration, the adsorption rate
and capacity increased. Furthermore, from Figure 6, it can be concluded that the rate of MV
adsorption on to calcium alginate hydrogel beads is faster than that
of magnetic hydrogel beads. The adsorption kinetics data were evaluated
using several adsorption kinetics models including pseudo-first order
(PFO),35 pseudo-second order (PSO),35,36 mixed 1,2-order (MOE),37 fractal-like
pseudo-first order (FL-PFO),38,39 fractal-like pseudo-second
order (FL-PSO),38,39 fractal-like mixed 1,2-order
(FL-MOE),38,39 and Elovich.40 The obtained results of data fitting are listed in Tables 1 and S1. The correlation coefficients show that the adsorption kinetic data
for MV onto calcium alginate hydrogel beads were better correlated
by FL-PSO model. Also, for the adsorption of MV by magnetic hydrogel
beads, best kinetic model is FL-MOE.

Figure 6 Experimental kinetics data for the adsorption
of MV by (a) calcium
alginate hydrogel beads and (b) magnetic hydrogel beads at different
initial concentrations of MV. The solid lines show the predicted values
by the best fitted model.

Therefore, it can be said that the kinetics of MV
adsorption on
both of the adsorption was found to follow fractal-like kinetic models.
The fractal-like model implies that the adsorption rate coefficient
is time-dependent for these systems. This means that the adsorption
pathway (or site) changes with time.38,39 The solid
lines in Figure 6 show
the predicated values by FL-PSO (for calcium alginate hydrogel beads)
and FL-MOE (for magnetic hydrogel beads).

2.3 Effect
of Adsorbent Dosage
The effect
of adsorbent dosage on adsorption of MV (with the concentration of
6 ppm) was studied using different amounts of adsorbents (0.0013–0.0026
g dry mass of calcium alginate hydrogel beads and 0.0019–0.0039
g dry mass of magnetic hydrogel beads).

Figure S3 shows the plots of adspecies amount versus time
for different adsorbent dosages. As can be seen in these figures,
increasing the adsorbent dosage leads to decreasing the adsorbed amount
per unit mass of adsorbent. However, as the adsorbent dosage increases,
the required time for reaching equilibrium decreases because of increasing
the number of active sites on the surface of the adsorbent.

More recently, a simple graphical method was proposed to elucidate
the effect of adsorbent dosages on the rate of adsorption process.41 The base of this method is the plot of normalized
adsorbed amount, , versus the normalized
time scale, t[m]n (where m is the mass of the adsorbent and n is
the order in the adsorbent mass). In fact, the normalization of time
was performed by multiplying each point time by the used adsorbed
mass (in each experiment), which was raised by an arbitrary power.
The value of this power should be changed until the curves overlay.
Here, we used this method for finding the order of the adsorbent mass
in the rate equation. For this purpose, the plot of  versus t[m]n was drawn for the
adsorption of MV
on calcium alginate hydrogel beads (or magnetic hydrogel beads). By
choosing the correct value for n, all curves (for
different masses of adsorbent) coincided, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Coincidence of curves
for n-values of (a) n = 0.8 for
calcium alginate hydrogel beads and (b) n = 0.5 for
magnetic hydrogel beads.

Therefore, it can be found that the order of mass of calcium
alginate
beads in the rate equation is around 0.8 and of magnetic hydrogel
beads is about 0.5 (Figure 7a,b).

Also, by finding the order of the adsorption with
respect to the
adsorbent dosage, it is possible to determine the adsorbent rate constant,
which is independent of the adsorbent mass. For this purpose, the
linear form of extended pseudo-second-order rate model was used41  where the values of mass independent
rate
constant, k2, and qe can be obtained from the intercept and the slope of the plot
of  versus t[m]n, respectively. Figure 8 shows the linear
plot of  versus t[m]n for the adsorption
of MV onto different
dosages of adsorbents. Also, the adsorption kinetic data of MV onto
calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads were correlated
with the linear form of classical pseudo-second-order rate model (35,36) for comparison.

Figure 8 Linear plot of extended pseudo-second-order for the adsorption
of MV onto (a) different dosages of calcium alginate hydrogel beads
and (b) different dosages of magnetic hydrogel beads.

The obtained values of k2 and qe for these two models are summarized
in Table S2.

The obtained results
show that in the case of extended pseudo-second-order
rate model, the k2 does not change with
the adsorbent dosage, whereas for classical pseudo-second-order rate
model, it is strongly dependent on the adsorbent dosage. To provide
a better visual understanding, the obtained values of k2 at different adsorbent dosages by pseudo-second-order
and extended pseudo-second-order models are shown in Figure 9. These figures clearly show
that the extended pseudo-second-order model provides the same rate
constant for each mass of the adsorbent.

order and (b,d) pseudo-second order for adsorption of MV on (a,b)

2.4 Adsorption
Equilibrium Studies
The
knowledge of adsorption isotherms furnishes basic information on adsorbate–adsorbent
interactions. The adsorption isotherms are mathematical relationships
which describe the distribution of the adsorbate species between the
liquid phase and the adsorbed phase at a specific temperature and
also at equilibrium conditions.

The equilibrium adsorption data
of MV on calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads
are shown in Figure 10a,b. The equilibrium data were modeled with recently presented models
including modified Langmuir (ML)42 and
modified Langmuir–Freundlich (ML–F)42 isotherms and also the classical ones including Freundlich
(F),43 Redlich–Peterson (R–P),43 and Toth43 isotherms.

Figure 10 Adsorption
isotherm of MV by (a) calcium alginate hydrogel beads
and (b) magnetic hydrogel beads. The experimental data are shown with
symbols, whereas the solid lines are the predicted values the by ML–F
isotherm.

The obtained isotherm parameters
along with their correlation coefficients
are tabulated in Tables 2 and S3. According to the results, the
best correlation coefficients were obtained for ML–F model,
indicating that the surface of both adsorbents is heterogeneous. The
solid lines in Figure 10a,b show results of fitting by ML–F isotherm. The maximum
adsorption capacities of MV, calculated by the ML–F model,
are 889 and 713 (mg/g) for calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic
hydrogel beads, respectively.

2.5 Thermodynamics of Adsorption
Isothermal
studies of MV adsorption onto calcium alginate hydrogel were carried
out at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 45 °C, and the
results are shown in Figure S4. This figure
shows that the adsorption capacity of MV onto calcium alginate hydrogel
beads decreases slightly with the increasing temperature. The equilibrium
data of MV adsorption on calcium alginate hydrogel beads were analyzed
with ML–F isotherm. The obtained results of this fitting are
listed in Table 3.

a The values of saturation

of MV at different temperatures were obtained experimentally.

Also, the thermodynamic parameters
[the standard Gibbs free-energy
changes (ΔG°), the standard enthalpy change
(ΔH°), and the standard entropy change
(ΔS°)] for the adsorption of MV adsorption
on calcium alginate hydrogel were calculated. The following equation
can be applied for the calculation of standard Gibbs free-energy changes
(ΔG°)42  where KMLF is
ML–F constant (which is a dimensionless parameter). For calculation
of the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°)
and the standard entropy change (ΔS°),
the van’t Hoff equation was used  

On the basis of this equation,
the values of (ΔS°) and (ΔH°) can be derived from
the intercept and the slope of ln KMLF versus 1/T plot (Figure S5). The obtained values of ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° are summarized
in Table S4. The obtained results show
that the adsorption of MV on calcium alginate hydrogel beads is endothermic
in nature and entropy driven.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the removal of MV by calcium alginate hydrogel beads
and magnetic hydrogel beads as adsorbent were studied using batch
experiments. It was found that the initial dye concentration, adsorbent
dosage, and temperature can influence on the removal efficiency of
MV by calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads.
Studies on the adsorption equilibrium showed that the ML–F
model gives a closer fit to the experimental data than the other used
isotherms. This observation is an indicator of heterogeneity of the
adsorbent surface. The maximum adsorption capacities of calcium alginate
hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads for the removal of MV were
obtained as 889 and 713 mg/g, respectively, which are very high. Also,
the findings of kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of MV on
calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads complied
with extended pseudo-second-order model. By studying various adsorbent
dosages, it was found that the mass of the adsorbent affects the rate
of adsorption. Also, the thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption
of MV on calcium alginate beads is spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy
driven. Finally, the advantages of the prepared adsorbents in this
study which make them potential adsorbents for practical usage are
biocompatibility, ease of separation from the solution, and high adsorption
capacity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
FeCl3·6H2O, urea, ethylene glycol, CaCl2, and MV were purchased
from Merck Co.; tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) was a product of
Daejung Co; and sodium alginate were purchased from Titra Chem Co.
All of the chemicals were used without further purification. In all
experiments, deionized water was used.

4.2 Preparation
of Calcium Alginate Hydrogel Beads
To prepare calcium alginate
hydrogel beads, 1 g of sodium alginate
was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water under continuous magnetic
stirring to form a transparent and viscous solution. The obtained
viscous solution was added drop by drop using a syringe into a CaCl2 aqueous solution (0.1 mol L–1). Hydrogel
beads were formed instantly and were maintained in CaCl2 solution for 16 h. Then, the calcium hydrogel beads were filtered
and washed three times with deionized water to remove any unreacted
calcium chloride and kept in deionized water bath.44

4.3 Synthesis of Iron Oxide
Nanostructures
The preparation of iron oxide was carried
out according to a previously
reported procedure.33 The precursor was
prepared by adding FeCl3·6H2O (1.2 g),
TBAB (7.2 g), and urea (2.7 g) to 180 mL of ethylene glycol in a 250
mL round-bottom flask. The obtained red solution was stirred and refluxed
at 195 °C for 45 min and then cooled to room temperature. The
resulting green precipitate was separated by centrifugation and washed
four times by ethanol and then calcined at 500 °C in a furnace
under the N2 atmosphere for 3 h and then cooled to 90 °C
in the N2 atmosphere. The obtained powder was cooled to
room temperature under ambient condition.

4.4 Preparation
of Magnetic Hydrogel Beads
For the preparation of magnetic
hydrogel beads, 1 g of sodium alginate
was dissolved in 50 mL of water; then, 0.5 g of iron oxide nanoparticles
was dispersed in it by sonication, and the mixture was vigorously
stirred for 2 h in a shaker. The viscous suspension was dripped into
a CaCl2 bath (0.1 mol L–1), and the magnetic
hydrogel beads were obtained. To complete the gelation reaction, the
magnetic hydrogel beads were allowed to be in contact with the CaCl2 solution for 16 h. The hydrogel magnetic beads were separated
from the solution using a magnet, washed three times by deionized
water, and then stored in a deionized water bath for further use.44

4.5 Characterization
The morphology,
composition, and particle size of the prepared iron oxide and dried
magnetic composite hydrogel beads were characterized using SEM (TESCAN-VEGA//XMU
and TESCAN Vega3), and the elemental identification of the samples
was performed by EDX spectroscopy. Also, the crystalline structure
of the dried magnetic beads was determined using an X-ray diffraction
(XRD) (Bruker AXS-D8 ADVANCE). The presence of various functional
groups in samples was identified by FTIR (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) using a KBr pellet, in the range of 4000–400 cm–1.

4.6 Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption
of MV onto calcium alginate hydrogel beads and magnetic hydrogel beads
was studied in a batch-mode system. The effect of different parameters
including the initial dye concentration, amount of the adsorbent,
and temperature on adsorption performance was assessed. The equilibrium
experiments were carried out as follows: constant volume of MV solution
(5 mL) with different initial concentrations (10–500 mg/L)
was mixed with a constant amount of wet adsorbent (0.0972 g). The
samples were put in a thermostat shaker (200 rpm and 25 ± 2 °C)
and shaken for 24 h to equilibrate. Then, the adsorbent was separated
from a solution by a filter or a magnet. The filtrate equilibrium
concentration (Ce) was measured by using a UV/vis spectrophotometer
(PG Instrument LTD model T80) at 585 nm. The adsorbed amount of MV
dye per unit mass of the adsorbent was obtained by 1  where C0 and Ce are the initial and
equilibrium concentrations
(mg L–1) of the dye solution, respectively; m is the dried adsorbent mass (g); and V is the solution volume (L).

The kinetics studies were carried
out at different initial concentrations of MV [2, 4, and 8 (mg/L)].
The experimental setup was the same as that for equilibrium experiments.
Here, the residual concentration of MV was measured at different time
intervals, Ct.

Also, the following equation was used for the determination of
the amount of MV adsorbed [qt (mg/g)] at each time interval 2
