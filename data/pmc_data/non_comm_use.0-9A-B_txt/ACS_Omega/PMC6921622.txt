Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an effective technology
for
upgrading pyrolysis bio-oils. Although, in the past years, this process
has been extensively studied, the relevance of the cross-reactivity
between the numerous chemical components of bio-oil has been scarcely
explored. However, molecular coupling can be beneficial for improving
the bio-oil characteristics. With the aim of gaining a better understanding
of these interactions, this work investigates the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
of mixtures of two typical components of pyrolysis bio-oils: guaiacol
and acetic acid. The catalytic tests were carried out employing a
bifunctional catalyst based on nickel phosphide (Ni2P)
deposited over a commercial nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite. The influence
of both hydrogen availability and temperature on the activity and
product distribution, was evaluated by carrying out reactions under
different H2 pressures (40–10 bar) and temperatures
(between 260 and 300 °C). Using blends of both substrates, a
partial inhibition of guaiacol HDO occurred because of the competence
of acetic acid for the catalytic active sites. Nevertheless, positive
interactions were also observed, mainly esterification and acylation
reactions, which could enhance the bio-oil stability by reducing acidity,
lowering the oxygen content, and increasing the chain length of the
components. In this respect, formation of acetophenones, which can
be further hydrogenated to yield ethyl phenols, is of particular interest
for biorefinery applications. Increasing the temperature results in
an increment of conversion but a decrease in the yield of fully deoxygenated
molecules due to the production of higher proportion of catechol and
related products. Additional experiments performed in the absence
of hydrogen revealed that esterification reactions are homogeneously
self-catalyzed by acetic acid, while acylation processes are mainly
catalyzed by the acidic sites of the zeolitic support.

1 Introduction
Biomass is the most readily
available source of renewable carbon
to supply the high demand of chemical fuels of the transport sector,
among other reasons, due to its good compatibility with the existing
infrastructure.1 In particular, the utilization
of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for biofuels production has
attracted a great deal of attention not only because of its abundance
and low cost but also due to the fact that this resource does not
compete with food production.2 Lignocellulose
fast pyrolysis is a relative effective method to produce liquid bio-oils
with yields ranging from 40 to 70%.3 However,
it is well known that, as a consequence of their poor physicochemical
properties (high oxygen content, acidity, corrosivity, and low stability),
pyrolysis bio-oils should be further upgraded before they can be used
in conventional combustion engines. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process
has been proven to be a very promising route for the production of
satisfactory liquid biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass4 since it allows biofuel upgrading by oxygen removal
in the form of water, enhancing the fuel properties of pyrolysis bio-oils.5

In this context, numerous efforts have
been devoted during the
past years to the development of efficient and selective hydrodeoxygenation
(HDO) catalysts. Typically, HDO catalysts can be classified in several
groups regarding the chemical nature of the hydrogenating component:
Mo-based sulfides, noble metals, transition metals and metal carbides,
nitrides, and phosphides.6−11 This last kind of catalysts, particularly those based on nickel
phosphide supported on different solids, has provided encouraging
results in the past few years.12 In this
sense, the use of acid solids as supports (i.e., ZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15)
is of particular interest since they may promote synergic interactions
between the metal active phase and their intrinsic acid sites, leading
to sequential hydrogenation-dehydration-hydrogenation reactions, which
improves the overall HDO efficiency.1,9,13−15

In spite of the extensive
research carried out in this field, most
of the studies reported in the literature deals with the hydrodeoxygenation
of representative single molecules of lignocellulosic bio-oils such
as phenol, anisole, guaiacol, or hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), among
others.16−18 However, pyrolysis bio-oils consist of a complex
mixture of oxygenated organic compounds, which can include more than
300 different molecules. Thus, this simplified composition overlooks
molecular interactions occurring during the upgrading process between
the different organic functionalities.19 Conversely, although detailed studies of the HDO of real bio-oils
are available in the literature, owing to the analytic difficulties
and the intractable complexity of the network of chemical reactions
involved, the knowledge of the mechanistic aspects of this upgrading
process is rather incomplete.20

The
presence of pyrolysis bio-oils of carboxylic acids, mainly
acetic and formic, could have a significant impact on the hydroprocessing
of other bio-oil components since they can promote acid-catalyzed
reactions (dehydration, alkylation, cracking, coke formation, etc.)
and react with other functionalized molecules. Likewise, phenolic
derivatives, which are relatively abundant in pyrolysis bio-oils (up
to 30 wt %), are considered the most refractory compounds to be deoxygenated
under hydrogenation conditions. Therefore, the study of the interaction
between both types of organic compounds could provide relevant information
about the most significant cross-reactivity pathways contributing
to the bio-oil upgrading. In this context, Wan et al.21 screened the effect of acetic acid on p-cresol hydrodeoxygenation over different catalysts based on supported
noble metals (Ru/C, Pt/C, Ru/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, etc.). They found that acetic acid presence
improves p-cresol hydrodeoxygenation, in aqueous
solutions, by enhancing the selectivity toward methylcyclohexane due
to the promotion of dehydration reactions over Ru/C.21 Interesting results have been also reported about the hydrodeoxygenation
of guaiacol and propionic acid blends over supported Ni catalysts.
In this work, in addition to the components coming from the direct
hydrodeoxygenation of individual substrates, mainly cyclohexane and
propane, alkylated and esterificated compounds were also detected,
which led to an increase in the hydrocarbon chain length of the reaction
products, decreasing carbon loss in the gas phase.22 In the same way, HDO of aqueous solutions of guaiacol and
acetic acid has been investigated using Ni on red mud at rather harsh
operation conditions, achieving a notable yield of C8 hydrocarbons.23 More recently, hydrotreating of methanol solutions
containing furfural, hydroxyacetone, guaiacol, and acetic acid over
Cu/SBA-15 has shown to lead to the formation of diverse saturated
esters and alcohols.24

These reports
emphasize the potential interest of coupling reactions
for the upgrading of bio-oils. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding
of the interactions and cross-reactivity between these components
during bio-oil catalytic hydrodeoxygenation is still necessary to
gain a better control of the selectivity. Furthermore, there is also
a growing interest on using light carboxylic acids such formic acid
as a source of hydrogen in catalytic transfer hydrogenation.25 Considering the abundance of these chemicals
in bio-oils, it is conceivable to take advantage of them for reducing
the hydrogen demand during HDO, with the subsequent advantages for
the economy and sustainability of the process.

On this background,
this work investigates the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
of mixtures of two typical components of pyrolysis bio-oils: (i) guaiacol,
a representative molecule of phenolic monomers of lignin, which possesses
a single molecule, both hydroxyl and methoxy functionalities, and
(ii) acetic acid, the most abundant carboxylic acid in pyrolysis bio-oils
with a concentration typically ranging between 5 and 17 wt %.26 Guaiacol has a tendency to form coke through
polymerization and presents high resistance to hydrodeoxygenation,4,27,28 while acetic acid also promotes
repolymerization reactions and is the main responsible of bio-oil
aging and corrosion during storage.29 Besides,
HDO of this carboxylic acid generate volatile products of limited
value, and accordingly, several routes for promoting C–C formation
with acetic acid has been proposed,30−33 whereas its use as a solvent
for the hydrotreating of methoxyphenols has also been considered.34

The study of the cross-reactivity between
guaiacol and acetic acid
has been carried out, varying the reaction temperature and the hydrogen
availability in the reaction media in order to investigate the eventual
contribution of catalytic transfer hydrogenation. Likewise, some catalytic
tests were performed under an inert atmosphere (N2) to
explore the role of nonhydrogenating catalytic centers in the reaction
network. A bifunctional system based on nickel phosphide supported
on a commercial nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite has been selected as
a catalyst for these experiments owing to its remarkable results in
a previous investigation with similar substrates, which have shown
the excellent activity of this catalyst, comparable to those based
on platinum metal group elements at an affordable cost.14

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ni2P/ZSM-5 Physicochemical Properties
The crystallinity of both support and bifunctional catalyst as
well as the presence of nickel phosphide phases in the loaded material
were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1). Diffraction patterns show the presence
of the characteristic reflections of MFI topology at 2θ ranges
of 8–10° and 20–25°, which remain unmodified
after nickel phosphide loading. In the pattern corresponding to the
loaded catalyst following reduction in H2, the presence
of the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 40.8°, 44.6°,
and 47.3° reveal the Ni2P phase formation, which is
reported to be the most active nickel phosphide for hydrotreatment
processes.35,36 The absence of diffraction signals
corresponding to metallic Ni or other nickel phosphide phases denotes
the complete conversion of the metal precursors into Ni2P.

The main physicochemical properties of both samples
are summarized
in Table 2. Inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses indicate
that the nickel content in the loaded material is close to the target
value (10 wt % Ni). The Ni/P molar ratio estimated was of 1.49, higher
than the molar proportion used during the support impregnation ([Ni/P]MOL = 1) due to the partial volatilization of phosphorous during
reduction. However, this value is lower than the stoichiometric ratio
of the metal-rich Ni2P active phase. Similar results have
been frequently found for Ni2P catalysts, indicating that
unreacted phosphorus-containing species are also present over the
catalysts surface, most likely in the form of P–OH groups,
which can act as weak Brönsted acid sites.37

Textural properties, estimated from Ar adsorption–desorption
isotherms, corresponding to the zeolitic support and impregnated catalyst
are also summarized in Table 2. The commercial ZSM-5 support exhibits SBET and SMS+EXT values of
452 and 123 m2/g, respectively. These values are somehow
higher than those typically reported for MFI zeolites, which is ascribed
to the nanocrystalline nature of this sample. In this sense, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images, taken over the parent support, show
zeolitic nanocrystals with sizes comprised between 30 and 60 nm (Figure 2A). The loading of
the active phase causes a decrease in specific surface area of 57
m2/g (approximately a reduction by 12%) due to partial
pore blockage caused by metal phosphide nanoparticles, affecting both
the microporous network and external surface.14 TEM images of the reduced catalyst reveal that these Ni2P nanoparticles possess a heterogeneous size distribution in the
range of 2.5–51 nm and a D50 of
7 nm (Figure 2C and Table 2).

Figure 2 TEM images acquired over
(A) raw ZSM-5 and (B) Ni2P/ZSM-5
catalyst. (C) Ni2P particle size distribution.

The density and strength of acidic sites were evaluated
by means
of NH3-TPD experiments (Figure S1). The raw zeolitic material exhibits two desorption signals centered
around 175 and 360 °C, which involves the existence of acid sites
with different strengths. Thus, the peak at low temperatures is assigned
to NH3 interacting with the weak acid sites, while the
signal registered at higher temperatures should correspond to NH3 bound on stronger acidic sites. After Ni2P incorporation,
a notable reduction in the overall acidity value is observed (from
0.39 to 0.27 mmol NH3/g), which is mainly due to removal
of the high temperature feature, generally associated with stronger
acidic sites. This variation of the TPD profile is attributed to the
partial coverage of the zeolitic acid sites by the deposition of metallic
nanoparticles and the nucleation of Ni species on the acidic hydroxyl
groups.38 Although the particle size distribution
is broad, this interaction could favor the formation of some highly
dispersed Ni2P nanoclusters during the calcination and
reduction process, which can improve the activity of the final bifunctional
catalyst. In addition, for the loaded material, the maximum NH3 desorption peak appears centered at 156 °C, which is
assigned to the presence of a new acidity, most likely of moderate
strength, generated by the nickel phosphide deposition, in particular
Niα+ Lewis acid sites and P–OH Brønsted
acid sites.17

2.2 Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Guaiacol,
Acetic Acid, and Their Blends
Previous reports on the HDO
of different phenol-related chemicals over catalysts based on Ni2P revealed that the main products are cyclohexane derivatives,
which are obtained with very high yields (>80%).12,14 Studies regarding the hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid are more
scarce, but a recent investigation reported that ethyl acetate and
light hydrocarbons (ethylene and ethane) are formed over a Mo2C catalyst at a low hydrogen pressure.39 In the present work, in order to set a reference for comparison
purposes, two HDO reactions were carried out using, as feeds, pure
guaiacol (R1 in Table 1) and acetic acid (R2 in Table 1) solved in decalin. The catalytic results, expressed
in terms of substrate conversion and product selectivities, are presented
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 HDO reactions
of pure guaiacol (R1) and acetic acid (R2) at 260
°C and 40 bar of H2.

Under these reaction conditions (260 °C and
40 of H2), guaiacol shows a very high conversion value,
being close to 89%,
and a selectivity toward cyclohexane of 85%. These results confirm
the high activity for HDO of phenolic derivatives of the Ni2P/ZSM-5 catalytic system, as it was previously reported in the literature.14 In addition to cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane
(∼7.5%) and hexane (∼3%) are also detected but in a
much lower proportion. The presence of this last compound denotes
the occurrence of ring-opening reaction followed by its contraction,
which are catalyzed by the acid sites of the zeolitic support. Minor
amounts of other compounds such as benzene, anisole, veratrole, or
phenol are also identified in the reaction media. The presence of
these components indicates the existence of other minority transformation
routes (e.g., demethylation), as previously reported.22 The concentration of gas products, mainly CH4 and CO generated by guaiacol demethylation and decarbonylation,
was very low: <0.25 wt % referred to the initial guaiacol amount
(see Figure S2).

Acetic acid exhibits
a conversion close to 31% (R2), being almost
three times lower than for guaiacol, probably due to the higher substrate
concentration present in the reaction mixture (3.3 vs 8 wt %) and
the more severe temperature needed for the efficient hydrodeoxygenation
of acetic acid.30,40 In this case, ethyl acetate is
the only compound detected in the liquid phase, which is formed by
the esterification between acetic acid and ethanol generated from
acetic acid hydrogenation. The absence of ethanol in the liquid mixture
suggests that, under these conditions, it easily reacts with the unconverted
acetic acid as soon as it is formed, in accordance with previous reports.39,41 Furthermore, acetone is not detected in this assay, suggesting that
ketonization reactions are not significant over Ni2P/ZSM-5
catalysts under these conditions. The contribution of gaseous fraction
is low but appreciably higher than for guaiacol HDO, ∼2.5 wt
% referred to the acetic acid fed into the reaction media, being mostly
composed of CH4, CO, and a much lower concentration of
ethane (see Figure S2). Formation of the
majority of gases can be ascribed to the thermal decomposition of
acetic acid in the reducing environment. On the other hand, ethane
is produced from the complete hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, as
it has been found previously using different catalysts.42,43

Previous catalytic tests with single-component solutions provide
substantial information about the reactivity of guaiacol and acetic
acid under hydrotreating conditions. However, pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading
actually involves a convoluted reaction network resulting from the
interactions between molecules with different functional groups, either
existing initially or being created in this complex liquid matrix.
Thus, in order to ascertain the intermolecular reactivity between
two of the most abundant families in pyrolysis bio-oils (carboxylic
acids and methoxyphenols), hydrodeoxygenation experiments have been
carried out using acetic acid and guaiacol blends. The first catalytic
assay (R3) was carried out under the same reaction conditions as those
employed in the previous experiments with single components (260 °C,
40 bar of H2, and 3.3% guaiacol and 8% of acetic acid dissolved
in decalin). The time evolution of both the conversion and the product
distribution obtained in this catalytic test is depicted in Figure 4. For the sake of
comparison with the previous experiments performed using pure model
compounds as feeds, both conversion and product selectivity were estimated
referred to each substrate. Although this description of the data
leads to certain duplicity, as products of coupling appear in both
guaiacol and acetic acid graphs (e.g., guaiacol acetate is considered
in both the selectivity of guaiacol and acetic acid), it facilitates
the discussion of the transformation routes.

Figure 4 Variation of the conversion
and the selectivity with respect to
(A) guaiacol and (B) acetic acid as a function of the reaction time
obtained in the catalytic hydrotreating reaction (R3) of the blend
at 260 °C and 40 bar of H2.

As it can be appreciated in Figure 4, some conversion (ca. 10% for guaiacol and
12.5% for
acetic acid) takes place during heating up of the reactor (the onset
time of reaction is taken when the reactor reaches the selected temperature)
mainly due to production of guaiacol acetate and in lower extent ethylguaiacol,
following reaction paths discussed in detail below. On the other hand,
the degree of transformation attained for guaiacol and acetic acid
in the blend after 120 min are lower than those obtained when using
single components. This reduction in conversion is especially pronounced
for guaiacol, which drops from 89 to 35%, while for acetic acid, the
conversion decreases slightly from 31 to 26%. This behavior is in
contrast with the reports on the HDO of oxygenated aromatics in aqueous
solutions with no acidic catalyst such as Ru/C, where acetic acid
has a promoting effect by facilitating dehydration of intermediate
cyclic alcohols.23 In the present case,
these data evidence a competition for the catalytic active centers
between both substrates, presumably explained by the acetic acid preferential
adsorption on the active sites of the catalyst because of its smaller
molecular size and its tendency to form carboxylates, which inhibits
the guaiacol hydrodexygenation.44,45 In this respect, the
lower electronic density of Ni in the phosphide may favor a strong
adsorption of acetic acids and, subsequently, the partial deactivation
of Ni2P/ZSM-5,17 as compared
with Ni/ZSM-5, which does not show any significant loss of activity
when treating guaiacol and propionic acid blends.22

Temporal evolution of the guaiacol-derived products
shows a strong
decay of the guaiacol acetate concentration with reaction time, while
the proportion of other molecules such catechol, cyclohexane, anisole,
and catechol acetate increases initially but tends to level off at
longer reaction times. In contrast, the concentration of ethyl catechol
rises appreciably after 120 min of reaction, while ethyl guaiacol
selectivity is high initially but grows only slightly with the progress
of the reaction. Considering the final selectivity toward cyclohexane,
the value is much lower than that attained for the pure feed (∼21
vs 85%), denoting a reduction in the HDO efficiency. As a consequence,
intermediate products of HDO such as anisole (∼7.5%), phenol
(∼7.2%), and especially catechol (∼9%) appear in larger
proportion in the reaction mixture than in the case of the tests performed
with pure guaiacol. In addition, esterification products, such as
guaiacol acetate (∼15%), catechol acetate (∼2.6%), and
diacetoxybenzene (∼2.4%), generated by the reaction between
the phenolic substrate and some of its HDO intermediates with acetic
acid, are also detected. Thus, ester selectivity (ca. 15%) is almost
as much as that of cyclohexane, which is the product of complete HDO.
That product distribution is in sharp contrast with that obtained
from HDO of pure guaiacol, which led to selectivity toward alkanes
of more than 95%. Remarkably, such large variations in product distribution
were not reported for Ni/ZSM-5 when dealing with propionic acid and
guaiacol mixtures, also suggesting that the partial deactivation of
Ni2P by acetic acid modulates the product distribution
of the blends with guaiacol. Anyhow, through esterification and ethylation
reactions, acetic acid is consumed, forming molecules with longer
chain length. Simultaneously, both oxygen (removed as H2O in esterification) content and acidity are decreased, without requiring
any additives such alcohols and with lower hydrogen consumption.24,44

Under these reaction conditions, esterification products,
particularly
guaiacol acetate, could be further hydrodeoxygenated. Therefore, in
order to ascertain the behavior of guaiacol acetate under HDO conditions,
an additional catalytic test was carried out using guaiacol acetate
dissolved in decalin (3.3 wt %) as a feed (Figure S3). In this case, almost total conversion is achieved (∼99%),
with guaiacol as the major reaction product with a selectivity of
48%. Partial guaiacol acetate decomposition into guaiacol and acetic
acid reflects the existence of reversible equilibrium and the low
reactivity of this aromatic ester for hydrogenation. This fact can
be detrimental for the deep deoxygenation of blends containing this
chemical. As a result of the subsequent guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation,
anisole (∼14%), phenol (∼2%), and some amount of cyclohexane
(∼5%) were also detected in the catalytic tests with guaiacol
acetate. In addition, a small proportion of ethyl guaiacol appears
in the reaction mixture. As it is discussed in detail below, ethyl
guaiacol (mainly 4-ethyl, but other isomers are also detected) is
a product of the partial hydrogenation of apocynin, formed previously
as a result of the C-acylation of guaiacol with acetic acid. However,
alternatively, apocynin could be also generated by means of the Fries
rearrangement of guaiacol acetate via an intermolecular pathway, which
is catalyzed by acid sites.32,46

Interestingly,
ethylated products, mainly ethylguaiacol (∼16%)
and, in lower proportion, ethyl phenol (∼4%) and ethyl catechol
(2.5%), also appear in the reaction of guaiacol and acetic acid blends,
as it can be appreciated in Figure 4. Previous literature results have shown that further
deoxygenation to yield ethyl benzene is possible using aqueous blends
of guaiacol and acetic acid under higher temperature and pressure
with Ni-based catalysts.23 In the present
case, these ethylated products could be formed by the sequential hydrodeoxygenation
of acetophenones (mainly apocynin, but other isomers are also detected)
formed as a result of the direct C-acylation of guaiacol with acetic
acid. To confirm this statement, HDO reaction of apocynin was performed
under the same conditions, 260 °C and 40 bar of H2 (Figure S4), using 3.3 wt % of substrate.
HDO of apocynin mostly leads to ethyl guaiacol (∼69%, mainly
4-ethyl-guaiacol) and ethyl cyclohexane (∼21%) with a conversion
close to 88%. The low proportion of ethyl phenol and the absence of
ethyl catechol suggest their rapid conversion toward the final deoxygenated
product, ethyl cyclohexane, favored by the absence of acetic acid
in the reaction media. This result confirms that apocynin, previously
generated by acylation of guaiacol with acetic acid and, possibly,
by Fries rearrangement of guaiacol acetate, experiences the following
cascade of reactions: apocynin → ethyl guaiacol → ethyl
catechol → ethyl phenol → ethyl cyclohexane. A similar
reaction scheme has been proposed for the HDO of acetophenone over
Pt/Al2O3, which shows the easy formation of
ethyl benzene.47 This is a remarkable result
because, through this transformation, the complete deoxygenation of
the acetyl group is achieved without carbon loss, producing appreciable yield of ethyl cyclohexane, which
is a hydrocarbon in the gasoline range. Moreover, it is important
to highlight that acetophenones are themselves highly valuable fine
chemicals with applications in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
In particular, apocynin has been investigated as an anti-inflammatory
drug.48 Accordingly, it can be also of
interest to stop the progress of the hydrotreating reaction in order
to increase the selectivity to acetophenones.

The temporal evolution
of acetic acid conversion and product distribution
in the R3 test is displayed in Figure 4B, which shows that, although the total conversion
increases only slightly with reaction time, the selectivity varies
remarkably. In particular, the concentration of ethyl acetate increases
initially and then reaches a plateau, while, as mentioned above, the
proportion of guaiacol acetate progressively diminishes. The proportion
of methyl acetate is high and gradually rises with reaction time,
while the ethanol concentration is only significant after 100 min.
Interestingly, some acetone is produced during heating up possibly
due to ketonization in zeolite centers, as previously reported,30 but its concentration swiftly drops. Following
120 min of reaction, the major reaction products are ethyl acetate
and methyl acetate with selectivity values of ∼39 and ∼30%,
respectively. As it has been mentioned before, ethyl acetate is generated
by the reaction of acetic acid with ethanol formed during its HDO
process. In this case, a small amount of ethanol (ca. 4%) has been
also observed in the reaction mixture. Formation of methyl acetate
can proceed from acetic acid esterification with the methanol produced
by demethoxylation of guaiacol derivatives, as it has been reported
elsewhere.34 The selectivity toward the
reaction products coming from the cross-reactivity of guaiacol and
acetic acid, denoted as phenolic derivatives, are relatively low (<25%),
and this can be attributed to the high proportion of acetic acid employed
in the reaction feed.

With the information extracted from the
catalytic tests discussed
above, a reaction pathway for the HDO of acetic acid and guaiacol
blends is proposed in Figure 5, which, for the guaiacol transformations, implies three main
routes: (i) esterification to yield guaiacol acetate, which is reversible
and hardly produce any other chemical; (ii) demethylation and subsequent
esterification with acetic acid to eventually generate catechol acetate
and then diacetoxybenzene; and (iii) acylation and successive hydrodeoxygenation,
first leading to ethylguaiacol and, eventually, to ethyl cyclohexane
as an end product, which is a molecule of interest in fuel processing.
In addition, the direct transformations of each molecule take place
simultaneously following the scheme described elsewhere, yielding,
as final products of the HDO of guaiacol and acetic acid, cyclohexane
and ethyl acetate, respectively.40,49

acid blends. Please note that the positional isomers represented are
those detected in higher concentrations but mixtures of regioisomers
are generally obtained.

2.2.1 Influence of the Hydrogen Pressure on the
Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Guaiacol/Acetic Acid Blends
Results of the previous section have proven the existence of synergetic
effects in the hydroprocessing of acetic acid and guaiacol blends,
leading to the generation of esterification products and ethylated
derivatives with longer hydrocarbon length than the initial substrates.
The product distribution in these catalytic processes can be influenced
by the hydrogen pressure in the reaction media. In this regard, an
excess of hydrogen could favor the formation of alkanes, while partial
deoxygenation would be predominant at lower H2 pressures.
Interestingly, the possibility of using carboxylic acids as a source
of hydrogen, for the deoxygenation of guaiacol, is a potentially attractive
route for the upgrading of bio-oils. Thus, to get further information
about the role of hydrogen availability, in addition to the assays
carried out under 40 bar, a series of hydrodeoxygenation tests were
performed using pressures of 30 (R4), 20 (R5), and 10 bar (R6) of
H2. The conversion and product distribution corresponding
to these experiments are depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Conversion and products selectivity respect
to (A) guaiacol and
(B) acetic acid obtained in catalytic HDO reactions of the blend at
260 °C as a function of H2 pressure: Catalytic tests
were performed at 40 bar (R3), 30 bar (R4), 20 bar (R5), and 10 bar
(R6).

As it can be appreciated, the decrease in the hydrogen
pressure
from 40 to 30 bar, representing around 108 and 81% of the stoichiometric
amount of H2 required for the oxygen removal without C–C
bond saturation, respectively, do not produce significant variations
in the catalytic results. Thus, considering the results attained at
120 min, similar conversion values for both substrates (35 and 23%
for guaiacol and acetic acid, respectively) are obtained, and only
a small reduction in the selectivity toward HDO products is observed.
In the case of guaiacol, the cyclohexane selectivity decreases from
20 to 18%, while the proportion of catechol slightly increases from
9 to 11%. For acetic acid, the selectivity toward ethyl acetate lowers
from 40 to 34%, whereas that for methyl acetate increases from 30
to 35%. These results indicate that the amount of hydrogen available
in the reaction media is still enough to produce HDO reactions. However,
when lower hydrogen pressures are employed (10 and 20 bar, equivalent
to 54 and 27% of the required H2 for full deoxygenation,
respectively), the conversion values of both model compounds are significantly
diminished. This reduction is more marked for guaiacol (40 vs 28–31%)
than for acetic acid (25 vs 19–21%), most likely owed to the
preferential adsorption of acetic acid on the catalyst active sites,
which can be detrimental for the conversion of the phenol derivative.
As consequence, for guaiacol, the selectivity values toward the HDO
products such as anisole, phenol, and, especially, cyclohexane are
lowered. In the case of acetic acid, the product distribution remains
basically unchanged under 20 bar of H2 (54% of the H2 required for full oxygen removal), but a significant reduction
in ethyl acetate is observed at 10 bar of H2 (34 vs 16%).
These results denote that, under 10 bar of H2 (27% of the
H2 required for complete oxygen removal), there is a relevant
restriction in hydrogen availability for both substrates. Likewise,
at a H2 pressure of 10 bar, the proportion of guaiacol
acetate is higher than in previous reactions (∼22%). This is
an expected result since, when the hydrogen pressure is decreased,
the HDO route is appreciably inhibited, favoring the esterification
reaction. On the other hand, the proportion of acetophenones and their
ethylated derivatives are similar for these experiments, suggesting
that hydrogen does not play a key role on the initial acylation reactions.
Furthermore, gas phase analyses (see Figure S2) also reflect a sharp reduction in the formation of ethane as the
hydrogen pressure decreases, while CO and CH4 production
is only slightly diminished.

With the aim of exploring the hydrogen
influence over the formation
of acetophenones and ethylated compounds, an additional catalytic
test was carried out using the same reaction conditions but under
an inert atmosphere (2 bar of N2, R7). Likewise, in order
to further ascertain the role of the Ni2P phase and that
of acid centers provided by the zeolitic support, two additional reactions
were also performed using (i) the raw ZSM-5 zeolite (R8) and (ii)
a blank experiment without any catalyst (Blank 1). All these results
are depicted in Figure 7. Under an inert atmosphere, the conversion values achieved in these
experiments for both substrates are in the same range as those attained
using different hydrogen pressures (assays R3–R6). In contrast,
the product distribution is entirely different. Thus, over the bifunctional
Ni2P/ZSM-5 and over the raw support, guaiacol acetate,
formed by the esterification of both substrates, is the main reaction
product, with selectivity percentages of 85 and 88%, respectively.
The guaiacol acetate yield is even higher in the blank experiment
without catalysts. Accordingly, it can be concluded that formation
of this molecule is homogeneously self-catalyzed by acetic acid, with
a selectivity value higher than 99% (regarding to guaiacol). This
observation agrees well with the information reported in the literature
for similar phenolic derivatives.32 Furthermore,
it is important to stress that, basically, the same results were obtained
employing a reduced pressure of hydrogen (10 bar) in a test without
a catalyst (Blank 2, Figure S5), confirming
that hydrogen does not exert any influence in esterification reactions.
Regarding acetic acid, the selectivity toward guaiacol acetate is
somewhat lower (ca. 90%) in the blank test due the formation of a
small amount of methyl acetate coming from acetic acid esterification
with methanol, the latter being produced by demethoxylation of guaiacol.
These results clearly indicate that hydrogen transfer reactions from
acetic acid are not significant under these mild conditions and, accordingly,
hydrogen supply is necessary to achieve a significant degree of deoxygenation.
In this respect, it is also worth noting that in the absence of hydrogen,
acetic acid decomposition is remarkably reduced, as indicated by the
low concentration of CO and, especially, methane, which are only detectable
over Ni2P/ZSM-5 (see Figure S2). This fact suggests that active centers of nickel phosphide play
a role on this last process.

Figure 7 Conversion and products selectivity respect
to guaiacol (left)
and acetic acid (right) obtained in blank and catalytic reactions
at 260 °C and using an inert atmosphere (2 bar of N2) over Ni2P/ZSM-5 (R7), ZSM-5 (R8), and without a catalyst
(Blank 1).

Using Ni2P/ZSM-5 and ZSM-5 materials,
selectivities
toward C-acylated compounds (acetophenones) obtained under an inert
atmosphere are low but in the same range (≤5%) than those obtained
using different H2 pressures, corroborating that its formation
is not influenced by the presence of hydrogen. In these latter experiments,
the selectivity toward these products is slightly higher over the
raw zeolite than over the bifunctional catalytic system (5 vs 3%),
suggesting that this reaction is catalyzed by the acid sites of the
zeolitic support, which are partially blocked by the Ni2P nanoparticles during their impregnation, as discussed in section 2.1. Also, an increase
in methyl acetate production is observed when ZSM-5 is used, denoting
that demethoxylation of guaiacol can be promoted by acid sites of
the zeolite.

2.2.2 Influence of the Temperature on the Catalytic
Hydrodeoxygenation of Guaiacol/Acetic Acid Blends
In order
to determine the effect of temperature on the different transformation
routes of the guaiacol and acetic acid blends (see scheme of Figure 5), additional catalytic
assays were performed over Ni2P/ZSM-5 at 40 bar of H2 during 120 min at temperatures ranging between 260 and 300
°C. The variation of the conversion and the selectivity for both
guaiacol and acetic acid as a function of temperature are plotted
in Figure 8. This graph
show that the conversion of guaiacol increases almost linearly with
temperature, reaching 60% at 300 °C, whereas product distribution
changes remarkably. Guaiacol acetate contribution drops with increasing
temperature to reach only 5% at 300 °C, and at the same time,
the selectivity toward cyclohexane progressively decreases, being
only 7% at 300 °C as compared to 12% at 240 °C. On the contrary,
the contribution of catechol and, in a lesser extent, ethylcatechol
rises with increasing the operation temperature, while ethylguaiacol
concentration is only slightly affected by temperature. Although,
the increment of HDO activity at higher temperatures could be expected,
similarly to the present case, an increase in demethoxylation and
a decrease in full deoxygenation of anisole with rising the operation
temperature have been reported over Ni2P/SiO2.50

Figure 8 Variation of the conversion and the selectivity
with respect to
guaiacol (top) and acetic acid (bottom) as a function of the operation
temperature obtained in the catalytic hydrotreating reaction of the
guaiacol and acetic acid blend at 40 bar of H2 for 120
min: 260 °C (R3), 280 °C (R9), and 300 °C (R10).

In contrast with the behavior of guaiacol, conversion
of acetic
acid varies slightly with temperature. However, the product distribution
presents a clear evolution with a gradual increment of methyl acetate
and an almost parallel diminution of ethyl acetate with rising the
temperature. Ethanol production increases moderately with temperature,
while the proportion of phenolic derivatives slightly increases. This
is due to the fact that the lower production of guaiacol acetate is
compensated at a high temperature by the formation of ethylated aromatics,
as it is observed in the corresponding product distribution of guaiacol.

In summary, differentiated reaction processes occur in parallel
during the hydrotreating of guaiacol and acetic acid blends using
a Ni2P/ZSM-5 bifunctional catalytic system, giving rise
to a complex reaction network, as it is unraveled in this work. Along
with the direct HDO of guaiacol and acetic acid, esterification and
acylation reactions take place simultaneously, leading to the formation
of molecules with larger chain length and lower oxygen content. Although
esterification has a limited interest for the production of valuable
molecules, the C–C bond formation between both substrates is
particularly relevant because it allows an efficient deoxygenation
without significant carbon losses, stabilizing the reaction media
by means of acetic acid neutralization. In contrast, deep deoxygenation
of these binary mixtures to render pure alkanes is more challenging,
and lower HDO yields are obtained with these binary blends than in
the case of the tests performed with single components. As expected,
decreasing the H2 pressure is detrimental for the formation
of alkanes, but remarkably, partial deoxygenation to produce oxygenated
aromatics such as anisole or ethyl guaiacol is still important. These
general trends observed in the treatment of guaiacol and acetic acid
blends over Ni2P/ZSM-5 catalysts are accentuated with increasing
temperature because these more severe operation conditions are detrimental
for the total deoxygenation, as higher yields of chemicals such ethyl
catechol and ethylguaiacol are obtained at 300 °C. This route
of acylation and selective hydrogenation is highly promising to avoid
carbon losses in the gas phase, and accordingly, developing specific
catalysts for promoting those routes of transformation can have a
positive impact for bio-oil upgrading.

3 Conclusions
This work explores the
molecular interactions produced during the
hydrodeoxygenation of mixtures of two typical components of pyrolysis
bio-oil: guaiacol, a representative monomer of lignin depolymerization,
and acetic acid, the most abundant carboxylic acid present in these
bio-oils. The catalytic system selected for this study, a bifunctional
catalyst based on Ni2P loaded on a commercial nanocrystalline
ZSM-5 zeolite, is quite active for the HDO of pure substrates, especially
for the conversion of the phenolic derivative. However, when acetic
acid and guaiacol blends are processed, the HDO efficiency is reduced,
especially for guaiacol conversion because of the competence and preferential
adsorption of acetic acid over the catalytically active centers. In
exchange, several potentially interesting intermolecular interactions
were also observed using the Ni2P/ZSM-5 catalyst during
the simultaneous hydroprocessing of both substrates:1. Esterification reaction between acetic
acid and guaiacol produces mainly guaiacol acetate, which is self-catalyzed
by acetic acid. Although the formation of this ester can contribute
to stabilize the bio-oils, this route is of limited practical interest
because of the reversibility of the process and the reduced reactivity
in HDO conditions of guaiacol acetate.

2. Direct C-acylations, leading to the
formation of acetophenones (mainly apocynin), which are high-value
fine chemicals, with potential applications in cosmetic or pharmaceutical
industries.

3. Formation
of guaiacol ethylated derivatives
by the hydrodeoxygenation of the acetophenones previously produced.
In particular, ethyl guaiacol is readily formed under mild operation
conditions, and its yield increases moderately with temperature.



In contrast with the formation of the final products
of the direct
HDO (cyclohexane and ethane), these cross-reactions are not so sensitive
to the hydrogen availability. In fact, esterification is the major
process in the absence of hydrogen, and although the formation of
ethyl guaiacol from apocynin requires hydrogen, selectivities do not
change dramatically when H2 pressure varies in the 10 to
40 bar range. However, it is important to note that the overall conversion
decreases when reducing the hydrogen supply, and therefore the yield
of these products is lower at reduced H2 pressure. Furthermore,
these tests indicate that hydrogen transfer from acetic acid is not
significant under the present conditions. On the other hand, the increase
in the temperature facilitates demethoxylation reactions, leading
to a larger proportion of catechol and related compounds, while the
production of full deoxygenated molecules such as cyclohexane decreases
appreciably.

These results, obtained with this simple blend,
illustrate the
magnitude of the challenges faced when dealing with real bio-oils,
which contain hundreds of different compounds. Using Ni2P/ZSM-5 as a catalyst may result in a relatively poor HDO activity
due to the partial blocking of the active center by acetic acid. Accordingly,
if the goal is the production of hydrocarbons, it may be advisable
to perform an initial step of ketonization of the bio-oils to remove
the carboxylic acids before the HDO step. However, it also worth noting
that the occurrence of reactions between phenolic components and carboxylic
acids found in the pyrolysis bio-oils during hydroprocessing can be
also beneficial if the most promising routes can be promoted. In this
respect, increasing the chain length eventually can lead to the formation
of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range such as ethyl cyclohexane, although
the total yield of hydrocarbons is lower for these binary blends.
Overall, the above described molecular interactions can contribute
to achieve a higher stability and quality of the upgraded bio-oil,
with lower hydrogen consumption than in a pure hydrodeoxygenation
process.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Ni2P/ZSM-5 Bifunctional
Catalyst
The catalyst was prepared by impregnation process
of a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite with a total loading of 10 wt % of nickel
using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and a Ni/P molar ratio of 1 in order to favor
the formation of the Ni2P metal-rich active phase.51 The impregnated solid was dried overnight at
room temperature and then at 120 °C for 24 h and subsequently
calcined at 500 °C for 5 h under static air conditions. Afterward,
the phosphate catalyst obtained was reduced at 650 °C in a tubular
furnace for 3 h in a hydrogen flow (80 mL·min–1) and finally passivated by progressive introduction of an air flow
at room temperature.12 The zeolitic support
is a commercial nanocrystalline ZSM-5 kindly supplied by Clariant
with [Si/Al]MOL = 42 and SBET = 452 m2/g.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
XRD patterns
corresponding to the zeolitic support and the Ni2P loaded
catalyst were recorded with a Philips PW 3040/00 X’Pert diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. Ni, P, and Al contents
were determined by means of ICP-OES analyses carried out on a Perkin
Elmer Optima 7300 AD instrument after acidic digestion of the catalyst.
TEM images of these materials were acquired using a PHILIPS TECNAI
20T microscope working at 200 kV. The Ni2P particle size
distribution was estimated with Image J software from TEM images taken
over the supported catalytic system. Textural properties of both parent
zeolite and bifunctional catalyst were determined from Ar adsorption–desorption
isotherms at 87 K measured on a Quantachrome AUTOSORB iQ system. The
surface area was calculated using the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller)
equation, while surface values corresponding to both the microporous
system and external surface were estimated using the nonlocal density
functional theory (NL-DFT) method. The total pore volume was determined
at a relative pressure of 0.98. The acidity of the samples was evaluated
by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD)
employing a Micromeritics AUTOCHEM 2910 analyzer. These assays were
performed using a quartz microreactor, heating the sample from room
temperature up to 600 °C for 1 h with an inert gas. Then, the
material was cooled down to 100 °C and saturated with a 10 vol
% NH3/He mixture, removing the physisorbed ammonia by an
inert gas flow. Finally, the temperature was linearly increased up
to 550 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C/min. The desorbed
ammonia was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector.

4.3 Catalytic Activity Tests
Catalytic
assays were performed in a 100 mL stainless steel high-pressure stirred
batch reactor using different reaction mixtures. First, hydrotreating
tests of the individual compounds were carried out at 260 °C
and 40 bar of hydrogen using the following feeds: (i) 3.3 wt % guaiacol
in decalin and (ii) 8 wt % of acetic acid in decalin. Then, a mixture
of 3.3 wt % guaiacol and 8 wt % of acetic acid in decalin [(guaiacol/acetic
acid)MOL of 0.2] was tested at different temperatures (260,
280, and 300 °C) and hydrogen pressures (10, 20, 30, and 40 bar
of H2, with ∼37 bar as the stoichiometric amount
of H2 required for the oxygen removal without C–C
bond saturation). In addition, several catalytic tests were performed
under an inert atmosphere (2 bar of N2) at 260 °C.
Likewise, hydrodeoxygenation reaction tests using both guaiacol acetate
and apocynin as substrates (3.3 wt % in decalin) were also performed
as a reference since they were detected as reaction intermediates. Table 1 summarizes all the
catalytic experiments performed in this work and the reaction conditions
employed.

In a typical experiment, 50 mL of the corresponding
feed was loaded into the reactor together with 150 mg of catalyst.
After that, the system was purged three times with 3 bar of N2 and then pressurized until the corresponding reaction pressure
(H2 o N2) at room temperature. Subsequently,
the reactor was heated up to the selected reaction temperature (260–300
°C) and kept at that temperature along the reaction time under
vigorous stirring (1000 rpm) for 2 h. In addition, the time evolution
of the catalytic activity was studied by carrying out assays at 30,
60, 90, and 120 min at 260 °C and 40 bar of H2. After
that, the reactor was cooled down with a water/ice mixture. Reagents
and products were analyzed by a precalibrated gas chromatograph (Agilent,
7890A) using an FID (flame ionization detector) detector and an HP-INNOWAX
column and by a GC–MS (Bruker) provided with a BP-5 column.
Response factors obtained after calibration with commercial standards
of the main components are collected in Table S1. Gas products were collected in a sampling bag and analyzed
in a dual-channel Agilent CP-4900 Micro Gas Chromatograph equipped
with a TCD detector.

The catalytic activity was evaluated in
terms of substrate conversion, XSUBS (%),
and product selectivity toward i product, Si (%), according
to the following equations    where n0 and n are the initial and final moles of substrate in the mixture,
respectively, and ni represent the moles
of product i in the final mixture. In the reactions
performed using guaiacol and acetic acid blends as feeds, the selectivity
values were estimated referred to each individual substrate. The carbon
balance of the catalytic experiments considering both the liquid and
gas fraction ranged in all cases between 95 and 100 mol %.
