High-pressure phase transitions of
AlB2-type transition-metal
diborides (TMB2; TM = Zr, Sc, Ti, Nb, and Y) were systematically
investigated using first-principles calculations. Upon subjecting
to pressure, these TMB2 compounds underwent universal phase
transitions from an AlB2-type to a new high-pressure phase
tP6 structure. The analysis of the atomistic mechanism suggests that
the tP6 phases result from atomic layer folds of the AlB2-type parent phases under pressure. Stability studies indicate that
the tP6-structured ZrB2, ScB2, and NbB2 are stable and may be observed under high pressure and the tP6-structured
TiB2 phase may be recovered at ambient pressure.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal
diborides (TMB2) are attracting considerable
research attention due to their unique combination of properties,
such as high melting point, hardness, chemical stability, high thermal
conductivity, low electrical resistivity, and low work function.1−6 TMB2 typically crystallizes in the well-known hexagonal
AlB2-type structure (P6/mmm, Z = 1) in which coplanar graphite-like B layers
alternately exist with close-packed TM sheets. Many experimental and
theoretical studies are focusing on these materials.7−20 For example, TiB2 and ZrB2 have been reported
as two prototype materials for the study of the topological nodal-net
structure,9 TiB2 is also a candidate
material for the development of lightweight high-temperature structural
materials,14 and MgB2 is a metal-compound
superconductor with the highest critical temperature.21

High-pressure research is leading to the discovery
of novel behaviors
of solids and potential technological materials. Pressure can significantly
alter the electron-bonding state to modify the physical properties
and/or subsequently induce structural phase transition. However, experimental
studies on the phase transition of AlB2-type TMB2 compounds are currently rare, and no significant results have been
obtained. High-pressure experiments have been performed on HfB2 up to 30 GPa,22 ZrB2 and VB2 up to 50 GPa,23 and
TiB2 up to 65 GPa,24 and some
related mechanical characteristics have been investigated; however,
no obvious phase transitions have been observed in any of these compounds.
Thus, the stabilities of AlB2-type TMB2 seem
unshakable, and the high-pressure phases of TMB2 are yet
to be determined.

The difficulty in experimentally identifying
high-pressure phases
of TMB2 has stimulated theoretical studies. At very high
pressures, performing experiments may be very difficult, but calculations
can be easily performed and will provide inspiration for future experimental
research, which is also one of the important meanings for computational
material science. Thus, calculations can be used to predict new high-pressure
phases. Ma et al.25 first theoretically
studied a nonsuperconducting high-pressure orthorhombic KHg2-type polymorph (Imma; Z = 4) of
MgB2 that is stable at >190 GPa through ab initio evolutionary
simulations. The thermodynamic properties of TiB226 and the elastic and electronic properties of
NbB227 under pressure have also
been calculated, and results do not suggest structural transformations
over a wide range of pressure (0–200 GPa). Zhang et al.28 presented extensive structure searches to uncover
the high-pressure structures of TMB2 (Sc, Ti, Y, and Zr)
up to 300 GPa using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm. They predicted
that monoclinic C2/m phases of ScB2 and YB2 are stable above 208 and 163 GPa, respectively.
A tetragonal α-ThSi2-type structure of TiB2 has also been uncovered at 215 GPa, whereas ZrB2 persists
up to 300 GPa within an ambient-pressure AlB2-type structure.
At present, diamond-anvil cells (DACs) can generate pressure beyond
400 GPa29−31 (with a record claimed to exceed 1 TPa). These findings
motivated us to continue exploring the phase transitions of AlB2-type TMB2 under higher pressure.

In the
present work, the high-pressure (up to 800 GPa) phase transitions
of AlB2-type TMB2 (TM = Zr, Sc, Ti, Nb, and
Y) were systematically investigated using first-principles calculations.
All studied TMB2 underwent a novel phase-transition route,
that is, AlB2-type → tP6 (6 atoms per unit cell).
We discovered that the tP6-structured phase, which has never been
previously found as the high-pressure phase in AlB2-type
TMB2, was the new high-pressure phase in TMB2. The phase-transition mechanism of ZrB2, as a representative
example of the investigated TMB2, was systematically examined.
The stabilities of the new phases of TMB2 were further
studied. This study may enrich the common understanding of AlB2-type TMB2 high-pressure transitions and could
be interesting for further development of superhard materials.

2 Results and Discussion
The variable-cell structure
predictions were performed at 0, 200,
400, 600, and 800 GPa with systems containing 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18
atoms in the simulation cell. At 0, 200, 400, and 600 GPa, our simulations
with the only input of chemical compositions of Zr:B = 1:2 predicted
the most stable structure to be AlB2-type (Figure 1a), in complete agreement with
previous research.23,28 This successful prediction encouraged
us to explore higher-pressure phases. Our evolutionary simulations
at 800 GPa identified a new most stable ZrB2 with the P4/nmm structure (tetragonal structure
with 6 atoms/cell, namely, tP6) (Figure 1b). The formation of the high-pressure phase
tP6 resulted from the strong distortion of the planar B-sublattice
of the AlB2-type parent phase and the concomitant displacement
of TM atoms. At first glance, the tP6 structure looked similar to
the C2/m structure previously proposed
for both ScB2 and YB2 at high pressure28 but with more relative slip between the B and
TM atom layer. Moreover, the wrinkled B layer comprised quadrangle
B rings and not hexagonal B rings. Intriguingly, the TM atom naturally
fell in the middle of the pocket comprising four quadrangle B rings.
Clearly, such tight structural features of the tP6 phase were due
to high pressure.

Figure 1 Crystal structures of (a) AlB2-type with a
redefined
orthorhombic lattice and (b) the proposed new tP6 phases. Big and
small spheres represent the TM and B atoms, respectively. For ZrB2, the tP6 structure adopts a P4/nmm space group (no. 129) and contains 6 atoms/cell, wherein Zr atom
occupies the 2c (0, 0.5, 0.3219) position and B atoms occupy the 2a
(0.5, 0.5, 0) and 2c (0, 0.5, 0.84164) positions. At ambient pressure,
the optimized lattice parameters are a = 3.295 Å
and c = 5.917 Å.

After full optimizations of all proposed structures (see the Computation Methods section for details of structural
production), only 8 structured ZrB2 (i.e., AlB2-type,7 the proposed tP6, α-TiB2-type,32 β-TiB2-type,32 hR18,33 hP6,33 oP6,33 and hR933) retained their initial crystal
structures; the others (KHg2-type,25 hP12,33 oP12,34 and C2/m28) were either distorted or changed to other structures under the
given pressure ranges. ZrB2 persisted up to 800 GPa within
an ambient-pressure AlB2-type structure because no new
low-energy phase occurred within this pressure range, consistent with
previous research.23,28,35Figure 2 shows that
six structured ZrB2 always had higher enthalpies than the
AlB2-type phase under the considered pressures, and only
one high-pressure phase-transition route was found. For pressures
over 800 GPa, the tP6 structure became the most stable phase. The
equations of states (P–V)
of ZrB2 along the transition route were determined. Our
calculations suggested that the AlB2 → tP6 structural
transition was first order and accompanied by a pronounced 2.1% volume
drop and increased connectivity in the B framework from 3 to 4 (Figure 1a,b). This high-pressure
phase transition is the first to be found in ZrB2 compounds
and may have occurred in other AlB2-type TMB2 compounds.

relative to AlB2-type ZrB2 as a function of
pressure. The calculated equations of state (bottom) for the AlB2-type and tP6 phases together with experimental data from
ref (23) for the AlB2-type phase.

Figure 3a shows
the calculated enthalpy differences between the new phase tP6 and
the AlB2 types of the five TMB2 compounds (TM
= Sc, Y, Zr, Ti, and Nb) under different pressures. All presented
TMB2 compounds followed similar phase-transition rules,
that is, AlB2 → tP6 structural transition. The transition
pressure points can be distinguished from 350 to 1480 GPa in Figure 3 due to different
TM atoms. Although the results of thermodynamic calculations cannot
fully represent the experiments, their trends are meaningful.36 These high-transition pressures also explained
why no high-pressure phase transition of TMB2 was found
in the experiments within 70 GPa.22−24 These phase transitions
were all first order due to the significant volume reduction (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) Computed enthalpy
differences and (b) equations of state for
TMB2 compounds along the AlB2 → tP6 phase-transition
route.

To analyze the phase-transition
mechanism, we need to understand
the difference in atomic coordination before and after phase transition.
The coordination polyhedrons for the TM and B atoms of the AlB2-type and tP6 phases are plotted in Figure 4. High-pressure phase transitions resulted
in a significant disruption of symmetry in the corresponding coordination
polyhedron. Central atoms of the coordination polyhedral were pushed
aside from the AlB2-type phase to the high-pressure phase
tP6 structure. Therefore, the B atom in the tP6 phase had two different
Wyckoff positions (B1 and B2 shown in different colors in Figure 4). In addition, many
coordination polyhedrons with a square pyramid shape appeared due
to atomic centrifugation. The most obvious feature was that the coordination
atom numbers in the AlB2-type phase were 6TM and 12B for
the TM atom and 3B and 6TM for the B atom, whereas in tP6 phase, they
were all four atoms (4TM, 4B1, and 4B2) for TM and B atoms. The reason
for these differences was that the pressure produced severe wrinkles
in the planar structures of TM and B atoms, which are common in layered
structures under high pressure.

B atoms of the (a) AlB2-type and (b) tP6 phases. The green
polyhedron is for TM atoms;
purple and pink polyhedrons are for B1 and B2 atoms, respectively.

A similar high-pressure structural rearrangement
occurs in TMB2, so understanding the phase-transition mechanisms
is very
important. Experimental information about the actual path by which
a transition occurs is very difficult to obtain, but first-principles
calculations also allow investigations of transition paths. As shown
in Figure 5, the mechanisms
involved atomic displacement and lattice deformation under pressure.
The lattice deformation was obviously anisotropic. Lattice a was compressed by 40.6%, lattice c increased
by 56.0%, and lattice b was almost unchanged during
the phase transition. Therefore, the atomic displacements occurred
mostly in the a and c directions.
To be precise, the atoms along the a direction were
squeezed into up and down, thereby increasing the number of atomic
layers in the c direction and increasing lattice c. Finally, the B atoms were compressed from a planar honeycomb
structure into an undulating grid structure. At the same time, the
nearby Zr atoms slid into the bottom of the B-atom grid, forming a
more stable tP6 structure. These atomistic mechanisms indicated that
higher pressure in the lattice a direction favored
the phase transition from the AlB2-type to the tP6 structure.
If lattice a of the raw ZrB2 sample was
adjusted to be substantially perpendicular to the anvil culet of the
DAC, the tP6 structure can be synthesized in the experiment by taking
advantage of the nonhydrostatic pressure in DACs.

ZrB2 compounds under 800 GPa. AlB2-type: a redefined
orthorhombic lattice in P6/mmm symmetry

ZrB2 formulas. The top, middle, and bottom panels reveal
the AlB2-type to tP6 transition path viewed along the b, c, and a directions,
respectively.

To verify the mechanical stability
of the high-pressure phases
of TMB2, the elastic constants of the phases were calculated
(Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
The criterion used to determine the mechanical stability of a tetragonal
crystal was as follows:37−39C11 > |C12|, 2(C13)2 < C33(C11 + C12), C44 > 0, C66 >
0. According
to this criterion, the tP6 structures of ZrB2, ScB2, and TiB2 were all mechanically stable at the
ground state, whereas those of NbB2 and YB2 were
mechanically stable above 100 and 400 GPa, respectively. The bulk
and shear moduli of the five AlB2-type TMB2 compounds
were also calculated at ambient pressure. The simulated values were
compared with available experimental data, and results validated our
computational scheme (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information).

The dynamical stabilities of the tP6-structured
TMB2 were further evaluated. The ZrB2 phase
at 20 and 800
GPa, ScB2 phase at 50 and 600 GPa, TiB2 phase
at 0 and 1500 GPa, and NbB2 phase at 200 and 1500 GPa had
no imaginary phonon frequency within the entire Brillouin zone, that
is, these structures are dynamically stable (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). However, the tP6-structured
YB2 phase was found to be dynamically unstable over the
entire studied pressure range. These stability results indicated that
the tP6-structured ZrB2, ScB2, and NbB2 were stable and exist under high pressure like the KHg2-type MgB225 and that the tP6-structured
TiB2 phase may be recovered at ambient pressure. The lattice
parameters of the tP6 phases of TMB2 were calculated in
view of their possible existence under high pressure. Results are
listed in Table S3.

3 Conclusions
An overall report on the high-pressure phase transitions of AlB2-type TMB2 is presented. Details on the changes
in enthalpy, volume, and atomic coordination numbers from the initial
phase to the final phase, atomistic mechanism of the phase-transition
process, and stabilities of the new phases are included. Unlike in
the phase transitions of other AlB2-type TMB2, a novel transition route, that is, the AlB2-type →
tP6 structural transition, is found in ZrB2, ScB2, TiB2, and NbB2. The phase transitions result
from the atomic layer folds of the parent AlB2-type phase
under high pressure. The atomistic mechanism of the phase transition
indicates that a higher pressure in the lattice a direction is more favorable for the phase transition from the AlB2-type to the tP6 structure. Further research on the mechanical
and dynamical stabilities shows that the tP6-structured TiB2 phase may be recovered at ambient pressure and that the tP6-structured
ZrB2, ScB2, and NbB2 may observe
under high pressure. This study may enrich the common understanding
of AlB2-type TMB2 high-pressure transitions
and provide a DAC experimental scheme to obtain novel TMB2 metastable phases by adjusting sample crystal orientation.

4 Computation Methods
Two methods were used to determine
the high-pressure phases. The
first method involved “searching for existing structures.”
The 11 existing structures reported from the experimental and theoretical
studies of AlB2-type metal borides were as follows: the
tetragonal structures α-TiB2 type (SG, I41/amd)32 and
β-TiB2 type (SG, P42/mmc);32 the orthorhombic structures
KHg2 type (SG, Imma),25 oP12 (SG, Pnma),34 and oP6 (SG, Pmmn);33 the hexagonal structures AlB2 type (SG, P6/mmm),7 hP12(SG, P63/mmc),33 and hP6 (SG, P63/mmc);33 the monoclinic structure C2/m (SG, C2/m);28 the rhombohedral structures hR18 (SG, R-3m)33 and hR9 (SG, R-3m).33 The second method
used the recently developed evolutionary and particle-swarm optimization
algorithms for crystal-structure prediction, and the most stable structures
were predicted using the CALYPSO codes.40,41 Details of
the search algorithms and their applications are described in previous
reports.42−45

Calculations for structural optimizations, enthalpies, and
elastic
stiffness constants were implemented in the CASTEP code based on density
functional theory.46,47 The ultrasoft pseudopotential48,49 was used, and the exchange-correlation function was treated by the
Perdew–Berke–Ernzerhof form of the generalized gradient
approximation.50 A kinetic cutoff energy
of 800 eV and corresponding Monkhorst-Pack k meshes51 for different structures were then adopted to
ensure that the energy converged to less than 1 meV/atom. Structural
optimization was performed until the energy change per atom was less
than 5 × 10–6 eV, the forces on the atoms were
less than 0.01 eV/Å, and all stress components were less than
0.02 GPa. The P–V curve is obtained by fully
optimizing the structure under the given pressure. Phonon calculations
were carried out using a supercell approach within the PHONOPY code52 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package code.53 The selected calculation
parameters were all tested to ensure that energy convergence was less
than 1 meV per atom. To validate our computational scheme, benchmark
calculations were conducted for the ZrB2 phase. Our calculated
lattice parameters of a = 3.17 Å and c = 3.54 Å well agreed with the experimental results
of a = 3.17 Å and c = 3.53
Å for the AlB2-type ZrB2.54 The calculated bulk modulus of the AlB2-type
ZrB2 was 239.0 GPa, in agreement with an experimental value
of 240.1 GPa.55
