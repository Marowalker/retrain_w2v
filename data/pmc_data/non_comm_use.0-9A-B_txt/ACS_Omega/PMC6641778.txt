Herein, we report the crystal structure
and characterization of
mono-6-(l-aminopropanol)-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin (Ln@β-CD). A highly efficient, in situ generated
catalyst, PdCl2(Ln@β-CD),
was synthesized for palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions under
mild reaction conditions, and the use of this catalyst in Suzuki cross-couplings
was investigated. Low palladium loadings of 0.01 mol % PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) (Pd accounted for approximately
8.4% of the catalyst by mass) were found to be highly efficient for
Suzuki cross-couplings in water and afforded the corresponding biaryl
compounds in excellent yields. The catalyst can be recycled and reused.

Introduction
Over the past few decades,
water-soluble catalysts have gained
great interest for the development of novel catalysts for greener
chemical processes and synthetic methods.1−3 Water-soluble
catalysts and ligands are widely utilized in organic reactions because
of environmental and economical considerations.4

Cross-coupling has been established as a preferred
method for generating
C–C bonds in synthetic chemistry.5 Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are recognized as highly
versatile tools for C–C bond formation.6 Although Suzuki coupling reactions are among the most useful methods
for the synthesis of carbon skeletons, there are still improvements
that could be made to render this technique even more effective. It
has also been demonstrated that the use of palladium phosphine species3,7,8 is an excellent strategy for Suzuki
couplings under very low palladium loadings. However, phosphine ligands
are expensive, toxic, and usually hydrophobic and air-sensitive;7 therefore, cross-coupling reactions under phosphine-free
conditions are still an important challenge for researchers.9−11 Recently, different phosphine-free ligands as diverse as N-heterocyclic
carbenes,12 diimines,13 diamines,14 and amides15 have attracted considerable attention as competent
ligands for Suzuki reactions.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are good candidates
for involvements in aqueous
and reusable reactions.16 They are also
inexpensive and nontoxic. CDs are macrocyclic oligosaccharides possessing
hydrophobic cavities and hydrophilic group,17 and this allows them to be used in various applications. β-CD
and its derivatives have been extensively used as catalysts in aqueous
reactions as diverse as reduction,18 hydrolysis,19 oxidation,20 and
coupling reaction21 because of their ability
to solubilize hydrophobic compounds and their ability to recognize
different molecules.22 However, β-CD
is poorly soluble in cold water; thus, chemical modifications23 of β-CD are necessary to improve their
selectivity and solubility. In addition, modified β-CDs, which
are often highly soluble in water, can be easily separated from organic
products.24 Recently, Qi et al.25 reported a palladium(II)–dipyrazole complex
for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions. Kaboudin et al.26 have also reported a Pd(II)−β-cyclodextrin
complex for Suzuki–Miyaura couplings in water. However, catalyst
recycling was not possible and high catalyst loading was used in the
reaction described in their reports.

In this article, we describe
the synthesis and crystal structure
of the Ln@β-CD ligand. Furthermore,
we have developed an in situ-generated catalyst system (ligand + PdCl2 in water) that is an excellent catalyst for aqueous Suzuki
cross-coupling reactions. It has shown that PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) (Scheme 1) is an excellent catalyst for Suzuki reactions.
PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) shows
good performance parameters, such as a high efficiency, low toxicity,
low required palladium loading (only 0.00084 wt %), and good recyclability,
which should make it broadly applicable for future industrial processes.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ln@β-CD·H2O and PdCl2(Ln@β-CD)
Results and Discussion
The in situ-generated catalyst system was prepared in three consecutive
steps that are depicted in Scheme 1 by adopting Ln@β-CD
as the ligand and PdCl2 as the palladium source, which
coordinated with each other in water. The structure of Ln@β-CD·H2O was characterized
by single-crystal X-ray crystallography (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Single-crystal analysis of Ln@β-CD·H2O.

The initial experiments with Ln@β-CD·H2O revealed that it was poorly soluble
in cold water; thus,
we heated the solution containing the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex to 90 °C to obtain a clear
solution. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is an
important method for investigating complex formation in aqueous solutions. Figure S3 in the Supporting Information shows
the experimental isotopic distribution for the peaks at m/z: 1391.36, which was assigned to [M + Na]+, and m/z: 1356.38, which
was assigned to [M + Na – Cl]+. These results clearly
confirm the binding between PdCl2 and Ln@β-CD.

The catalytic behavior of the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex was studied
in the Suzuki coupling
reaction of aryl boronic acids with aryl halides in water. When the
reaction was carried out using aryl bromides and the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex (0.01 mol %)
for 4 h in water, the biaryl derivatives were obtained in isolated
yields of 80–100% in the presence of K3PO4·7H2O as the base (Table 1, entries 1–15). The control experiments
showed that without the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex, only a trace amount of the product was obtained
(Table 1, entry 20).
To further study the difference of the influences between the three
ligands and β-CD, a comparative experiment (Table 1, entry 21) was conducted. The
result showed that with only a trace amount of β-CD and palladium
chloride, p-bromotoluene and phenylboronic acid as
the substrates, only 6% of the coupling product was obtained. This
may be because of the poor solubility and no coordination site of
raw β-CD. The result clearly indicated the importance of our
ligand.

c The reaction was conducted under
ligandless conditions and with a trace amount of palladium chloride.

d The reaction was conducted
with
a trace amount of β-CD and palladium chloride.

As shown in Table 1, the heterocoupling of boronic acid derivatives
with various aryl
bromides gave the corresponding biaryl compounds in good to excellent
yields, and only o-methyl bromobenzene gave a low
yield (entries 4, 9, and 14). We think this is due to steric hinderance.

For the coupling reaction of 1-chloro aryl derivatives with phenylboronic
acid (Table 1, entries
16–19), the catalytic activity of the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex at 0.01 mol % loading was
not satisfactory and only 71% of the coupling product was obtained
using p-nitrochlorobenzene (Table 1, entry 18) as the substrate. The yields
with other substrates were very low under the same conditions. The
optimal reaction conditions will be examined to determine the applicability
of the present catalytic system in the Suzuki cross-couplings of various
aryl chlorides with different aryl boronic acids in the next stage.

By screening different bases, including K3PO4·7H2O, K2CO3, Li2CO3, Cs2CO3, NaHCO3,
and KOC(CH3)3 (Table 2), we found that K3PO4 and Li2CO3 were best when using the PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) complex (0.01
mol %) for 4 h in water. For KOC(CH3)3, the
yield was not satisfactory. This may be because of the poor solubility
of KOC(CH3)3 in water.

Our next stage focused on the reaction temperature
and catalyst
loading. As seen from Table 3, the yield of coupling product decreased when the catalyst
loadings were below 0.01 mmol %. Thus, the optimized reaction temperature
was 90 °C. Under the above optimized catalyst loading levels,
effects of temperature on the coupling yield and turnover number (TON)
were noticeable. Below 10 °C, the TON for this reaction was limited
to 5900. At 80 °C, a TON of 9.02 × 105 was observed.
The yield of the coupling reaction decreases to 5% when the reaction
temperature was decreased to 10 °C even if the amount of catalyst
was 0.1 mol % (Table 3, entry 11). This may be because the Ln@β-CD ligand is poorly soluble in cold water and thus proper
heating of the reaction system is necessary.

Remarkably, the PdLn@β-CD
catalyst
showed highly efficient catalytic activity for Suzuki reactions, which
afforded good to excellent yield with a high turnover number (TON)
up to 3.1 × 106 (Table 3, entry 5).

From a green chemistry perspective,
the focus is on the recycling
of the metal catalysts. We verified that after the work up of the
Suzuki coupling reaction of p-bromotoluene and phenylboronic
acid as a model reaction, the aqueous phase can still catalyze the
reaction with a fresh batch of substrates. The results obtained in
our experiments confirmed that it was possible to recycle and reuse
the catalyst complex at least six times after extraction of the products
with ethyl ether without significant loss of catalytic activity (Table 4). Notably, catalyst
decomposition to palladium black is not observed in the reaction,
and Ln@β-CD was found to effectively
stabilize the catalyst against decomposition and facilitate recycling.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that
PdCl2(Ln@β-CD), a cheap,
readily available, and
highly stable catalyst complex, can be used to tolerate a wide variety
of substrates in high yields from aqueous Suzuki coupling reactions
in air. All reactions can be directly conducted in aqueous media.
More importantly, the catalyst system can be recycled and reused several
times without significant loss of catalytic activity. We herein presented
an improved and generally applicable aqueous protocol for a range
of substrates with broad functional group tolerance. Suzuki reactions
can be performed under phosphine- and organic solvent-free conditions
based on PdCl2 and Ln@β-CD
in water. Additionally, we demonstrated an exceedingly simple, economically
convenient, and sustainable protocol for efficient Suzuki couplings.
Explorations of reactions with 1-chloro aryl derivatives and phenylboronic
acids as the coupling partners using the same method are currently
underway.

Experimental Section
General Information
The NMR spectra
were recorded on
a Bruker-400 NMR spectrometer. DMSO-d6 was used as a solvent. Chemical Shifts are reported in parts per
million from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal
standard. Crystal data were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer
with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (l = 0.71073 Å). Intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization
effects and empirical absorption, and the data reduction was carried
out using the SADABS program. The structure was solved by direct methods
using SHELXS-97. ESI-MS was performed on Exactive Orbitrap produced
by Thermofisher. Gas chromatography was performed on CP-3800 produced
by Varian.

Materials
All reagents were used
as received from commercial
sources. l-Aminopropanol and mono-6-(p-tolylsulfonyl)-deoxy-β-CD
were purchased from an online merchant without further purification.
All reagents were weighed and handled in air.

Typical Procedure for the
Synthesis of Ln@β-CD
All
chemicals were purchased directly
from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification.
The Ln@β-CD ligand was obtained
from a mixture of l-aminopropanol and mono-6-(p-tolylsulfonyl)-deoxy-β-CD. Mono-6-OTS-β-CD (0.7 g, 0.53
mmol) and l-aminopropanol (3.27 g, 43.4 mmol) were stirred
at 80 °C for 8 h in air. Then, 1.5 mL of water was added into
the mixture and it was washed three times with acetone to give a white
solid. Single crystals suitable for X-ray measurements were obtained
by recrystallization from water. The desired product was obtained
in 82% yield based on mono-6-OTS-β-CD.

Typical Procedure for the
Preparation of PdCl2(Ln@β-CD)
PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) was
formed in situ and was directly
obtained in water by mixing mono-6-(l-aminopropanol)-deoxy-β-CD
and palladium dichloride in 2:1 molar ratio. Ln@β-CD (0.040 g, 0.0334 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (16.7 mL), and palladium dichloride (0.003 g, 0.0167 mmol)
was added. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at 90 °C in air
by refluxing.

Typical Procedure for the Suzuki Coupling
Reaction
A Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar
was charged with
aryl halide (1 mmol), phenylboronic acid (1.5 mmol), PdCl2(Ln@β-CD) catalyst (100 μL
of a solution prepared from 16.7 mL of the above in situ-synthesized
catalyst system), base (1.5 mmol), TBAB (1.5 mmol), and water (2 mL).
After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature
and then extracted with ethyl ether. The ethyl ether fraction was
washed with 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid and water three times each,
and then it was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The resulting
crude product was purified and isolated by column chromatography using
200–300 mesh silica gel to give the final product.
