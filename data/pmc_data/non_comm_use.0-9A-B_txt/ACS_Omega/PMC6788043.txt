In this study, the
reaction mechanisms of metal–semiconductor
composites used as photocatalysts were demonstrated by first preparing
bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and then performing photodeposition
of metal nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of metal–BiVO4 (M–BiVO4, where M = Pt, Au, Ag) composites
were evaluated through dye decomposition under UV–vis irradiation.
The photocatalytic efficiency was significantly enhanced after Pt
deposition as compared to other M–BiVO4 composites.
The size or shape of BiVO4 was not the main factor for
the efficiency of Pt–BiVO4. However, a deposited
Pt co-catalyst was essential for the photocatalytic decomposition
of dye on the BiVO4 surface. Radical scavengers were employed
to elucidate the reaction mechanism during the photocatalytic reaction
with the Pt–BiVO4 composite. This study provides
details on the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction on
Pt at the BiVO4 surface under solar irradiation.

Introduction
Efficient purification
of industrial wastewaters is highly desirable
to address the diminishing availability of water resources.1−4 Recently, semiconductor photocatalytic processes have shown great
potential as an environmentally benign and sustainable treatment technology
in the wastewater industry.5−7 Although a multitude of metal
oxide photocatalysts have been investigated for potential use in photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants, most photocatalysts developed thus
far are wide band gap semiconductors. These include TiO2, WO3, SrTiO3, and ZnO, which are active only
under UV light.8−11 In this context, developing a photocatalyst with a high photon-to-charge
carrier efficiency under visible light is required.12

Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has tremendous
potential for
use as a heterogeneous photocatalyst that can be easily activated
under the visible-light wavelength range.13 However, the slow carrier mobility in the semiconductor contributes
to the poor catalytic efficiency of BiVO4.14 Previous studies have mainly focused on the size control
to improve catalytic properties when attempting to enhance the activity
of BiVO4. However, fast recombination at the semiconductor–solution
interface remains a performance bottleneck. Although efficient electrocatalysts
have been intensively studied for application in photocatalytic reactions,15,16 there is no guarantee that the best electrocatalysts will perform
equally well when they have been integrated into a photocatalyst.
Although noble metals have been intensively studied as efficient electrocatalysts,17−19 the origin of enhanced catalytic activity remains unclear. Further
studies must be conducted to elucidate the detailed mechanism.

Herein, we report the synthesis of metal–BiVO4 (M–BiVO4, where M = Pt, Au, Ag) composites to
improve the photocatalytic efficiency toward organic dye decomposition
under solar light irradiation. Our results showed that the Pt–BiVO4 catalyst considerably improved the decomposition of methyl
orange (MO) and mixed dye as compared to other BiVO4 catalysts.
The decomposition rates were studied using radical scavengers to clarify
the degradation pathways.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of BiVO4 and M–BiVO4 Catalysts
A mixture
of 20 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 20 mM
NH4VO3, and 1.0
g poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) precursor solution was prepared and
then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The
sealed autoclave was heated in an electric oven at 180 °C for
6 h in air. The as-prepared BiVO4 powder was annealed at
500 °C for 3 h in air to yield crystallized BiVO4.20 An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed
to produce reliable structural information about this material (Figure 1a). The diffraction
peaks of the BiVO4 crystals were indexed to the monoclinic
scheelite structure (JCPDS No. 83-1699), indicating a well-crystallized
BiVO4.13

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns; (b)

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
of (c) Bi 4f and (d) V 2p for BiVO4 crystals.

Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive experimental technique
used
to analyze the vibrational and structural properties of materials. Figure 1b shows the Raman
spectrum of BiVO4 in the range of 100 to 1000 cm–1. The Raman peaks of BiVO4 at 127, 213, 326, 368, and
827 cm–1 were in agreement with those of the monoclinic
BiVO4.21 Peaks of tetragonal
phase BiVO4 were not observed in the spectrum, indicating
that the monoclinic BiVO4 grew uniformly on the entire
particle. The surface composition and chemical states of BiVO4 crystals were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 1c,d). The two dominant peaks at 155.2 and 160.5 eV were assigned
to Bi 4f, which is the characteristic of Bi3+ species (Figure 1c).18 The observed V 2p peaks at 512.3 and 520.1 eV were attributed
to the oxide form of V5+ in BiVO4 (Figure 1d).22 The band gap was estimated from the onset of UV–visible
absorbance (Figure S1). From the absorbance
data, the monoclinic BiVO4 crystals showed a direct transition
with a band gap of approximately 2.3 eV, which is also consistent
with the value in the literature.13

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analyses were performed to identify the structural composition
of the BiVO4 crystals (Figure 2). The SEM image shows that the BiVO4 crystals had an average size of 716 ± 87 nm (Figure 2a). A high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image of the edge of a BiVO4 shows a lattice
spacing of 0.309 nm, corresponding to the (112) planes (Figure 2b). The energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometry of a BiVO4 crystal yielded an average atomic
ratio of 30:28 (Bi/V), indicative of the 1:1 atomic composition. A
spatial elemental mapping was also performed on a BiVO4 crystal to evaluate the distribution of each element (Figure 2c–f). The elemental
mapping confirmed that Bi, V, and O atoms were uniformly distributed
throughout the particle. Therefore, the XRD, Raman, XPS, and TEM results
verified the preparation of the monoclinic BiVO4 crystals.

and (b) HRTEM images of a BiVO4 crystal; (c)

O (yellow).

Light irradiation applied to semiconductor
particles in an aqueous
solution of metal salts results in the deposition of metal nanoparticles
on the surface of the semiconductor, characterizing a behavior known
as photodeposition.10 Various M–BiVO4 composites were prepared by photodeposition using three types
of noble-metal precursors (H2PtCl6, HAuCl4, and AgNO3), and methanol was used as a hole scavenger.
The three composites were denoted as Pt–BiVO4, Au–BiVO4, and Ag–BiVO4 (Figure 3a). Figures 3 and S2 show the TEM images
and XRD patterns of the M–BiVO4 crystals. The HRTEM
images of the edge of Pt–BiVO4, Au–BiVO4, and Ag–BiVO4 show the typical lattice
spacing of each metal (Figure S2), confirming
the metal deposition on BiVO4. The HRTEM image of Pt–BiVO4 shows a lattice spacing of 0.228 nm, which corresponds to
the (111) planes of Pt metal (Figure S2d). The XRD peaks of all samples were identical to those of the monoclinic
scheelite structure of BiVO4 (Figure S2). The XRD patterns of deposited metals could not be observed
because of the small grain size of metal nanoparticles. The Raman
peaks were also in agreement with those of the monoclinic BiVO4 (Figure 3b),
and the metal deposition did not influence the crystal structures
of BiVO4. The XPS at the Pt 4f level showed splitting peaks
at 71.4 and 74.4 eV, which corresponded to the metallic state of Pt
species (Figure S3).23

of Pt (red).

Spatial elemental mapping was
also performed for M–BiVO4 crystals to evaluate
the distribution of each element (Figures 3c,d and S4). The
composition and elemental distribution
of the Pt–BiVO4 sample is shown in Figure 3c,d. The elemental mapping
shows that Pt was homogeneously dispersed on the BiVO4 surface
with 1 wt % Pt loading. Au and Ag were also homogeneously deposited
on BiVO4 (Figure S4).

Photocatalytic
Activity of BiVO4 and M–BiVO4 Catalysts
The photocatalytic performance of BiVO4 and M–BiVO4 samples were evaluated through
the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV–visible light
(one-sun, 100 mW cm–2). Figures 4 and S5 show the
absorption spectra of the MO solution as a function of illumination
time in the presence of BiVO4 and M–BiVO4 catalysts. The blank test (MO without catalyst) under UV–visible
light showed negligible self-photolysis of MO. For pure BiVO4, the absorption peak at 465 nm gradually decreased, indicating a
partial degradation of the dye (approximately 20% after 240 min) under
UV–visible light (Figure 4a, green squares). Pt–BiVO4, Au–BiVO4, and Ag–BiVO4 were also tested for photocatalytic
MO degradation under the same conditions. After irradiation for 20
min, the degradation percentages were 2, 13, 22, and 99% for BiVO4, Au–BiVO4, Ag–BiVO4,
and Pt–BiVO4, respectively (Figure 4a). The Pt–BiVO4 composite
exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity for MO degradation
as compared to the other samples. Furthermore, the photocatalytic
activity of the Pt–BiVO4 samples improved with increasing
Pt content, and the 1.0 wt % of the Pt deposited sample (15 min photodeposition)
exhibited the best activity (Figure S6).
No obvious enhancement of the photocatalytic activity was observed
when more Pt particles were introduced.

Figure 4 (a) Photocatalytic degradation
rates of MO when using BiVO4 (green squares), Au–BiVO4 (blue triangles),
Ag–BiVO4 (pink triangles), and Pt–BiVO4 (red circles) crystals and without BiVO4 (black
squares); and (b) Stability experiments of Pt–BiVO4 crystals.

The recyclability of Pt–BiVO4 was evaluated through
cycling experiments, which resulted in practically unchanged photocatalytic
activity (Figure 4b).
The stability of the Pt–BiVO4 sample was further
investigated by XRD and XPS analyses following the stability experiments
(Figure S7). The XRD and XPS results showed
nearly identical peaks before and after the stability test (Figure S7), indicating that Pt–BiVO4 retained its chemical structure. In other words, the Pt–BiVO4 composite was photocatalytically stable.

To elucidate
photocatalytic activities, small BiVO4 crystals
were prepared using ultrasonic methods (BiVO4 sono-crystals).20 The XRD peaks of the BiVO4 sono-crystals
were indexed to the monoclinic scheelite structure (JCPDS No. 83-1699)
(Figure S8a), indicating a well-crystallized
BiVO4. The SEM image shows that the BiVO4 sono-crystals
had an average size of 495 ± 54 nm (Figure S8b). The BiVO4 sono-crystals showed a higher photocatalytic
activity for MO degradation than did the previous BiVO4 crystals. However, their photocatalytic efficiency was nearly identical
to that of BiVO4 sono-crystals after Pt deposition (Figure S9). The catalytic activity of BiVO4 was not the main factor for efficiency. However, the deposited
Pt co-catalyst was essential for the photocatalytic decomposition
of dye on the BiVO4 surface.

The photocatalytic performance
of the Pt–BiVO4 composite was also evaluated by
the degradation of cationic dye
and anionic dye mixtures (rhodamine B (RhB), and MO) under the same
conditions. The dye mixture was used because real-world wastewater
from industries commonly contain more than one type of organic dye.19 The results clearly confirm that both RhB and
MO dyes were rapidly degraded over the Pt–BiVO4 composite
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Photocatalytic
degradation rates of a mixed solution of MO and
RhB using Pt–BiVO4 crystals and time-dependent UV–vis
absorption spectra (inset).

Understanding the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions is critical
to improve the catalytic efficiency for practical applications. The
deposition of noble metals on the BiVO4 surface has been
reported to improve the photocatalytic efficiency by acting as an
electron trap due to the formation of the Schottky barrier, thus reducing
the electron–hole recombination process.8,24 The
highly improved photocatalytic activity of Pt–BiVO4 is also attributed to the Pt co-catalyst, which enhances the production
rate of oxidizing species. To evaluate the mechanism involved in the
high photocatalytic activity of the Pt–BiVO4 catalyst,
experiments on trapping reactive oxygen species (hydroxyl radicals: •OH; and superoxide radical anions: •O2–) were performed and analyzed (Figure 6a). The •OH radical formed on the semiconductor surface is an extremely powerful
oxidizing agent. It attacks the adsorbed organic molecules nonselectively
and participates in the further oxidation process. To investigate
the role of •OH in the photocatalytic degradation
of MO by Pt–BiVO4, a control experiment was conducted
in the presence of methanol (Figures 6b and S10). Methanol has
been used as a scavenger to determine the role of •OH in photocatalysis because it reacts rapidly with •OH (inhibiting pathway 1).25 The addition
of methanol reduces the degradation rate of the targeted contaminants
by Pt–BiVO4, indicating that the •OH-mediated oxidation process is the predominant decomposition pathway.
Although the photogenerated hole reacts with the surface-bound water
or OH– to produce the hydroxyl radical (pathway
1), an electron in the conduction band is removed by the oxygen (O2) or MO (pathways 2 or 3 in Figure 6a), thus maintaining electron neutrality
within BiVO4.8 A photocatalytic
experiment was also performed under inert conditions (argon) to identify
the formation and role of •O2– during the photocatalytic degradation of MO by Pt–BiVO4 (inhibition of pathway 2).26 The
photocatalytic activity remained nearly unchanged (Figure 6b), thus suggesting the absence
of inhibition under inert conditions (without O2) and the
minor role of •O2– in
the MO degradation. Therefore, pathway 1 is the predominant oxidative
decomposition pathway, and pathway 3 prevents electron–hole
recombination.

Figure 6 (a) Schematic representation of the dye degradation processes.
(b) Photocatalytic degradation rates of MO with Pt–BiVO4 in the presence of methanol and O2 as scavengers
under UV–vis light.

To further investigate the interaction of metal catalysts on the
semiconductor, BiVO4 and Pt–BiVO4 electrodes
were prepared on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (Figure S11). The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance
of BiVO4 and Pt–BiVO4 electrodes was
studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for water oxidation (0.1
M phosphate buffered, pH 7). The LSV was conducted from +0.3 to +1.0
V vs Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1 with chopped
light under UV–vis irradiation (light intensity: 100 mW cm–2). The Pt–BiVO4/FTO electrode showed
an enhanced photocurrent as compared to BiVO4/FTO (Figure S11), and this result agreed well with
the photocatalytic MO degradation outcome. This result indicates that
the photogenerated hole transfer could be enhanced when the Pt catalyst
is deposited on the BiVO4 surface.

Based on the PEC
and photocatalytic results, the enhanced photocatalytic
efficiencies were attributed to the rapid charge transfer from BiVO4 to the attached Pt nanoparticles, which enhanced the production
rate of hydroxyl radicals. Although the Pt–BiVO4 composite exhibits distinct advantages because of the rapid charge
transfer from BiVO4 to the attached Pt nanoparticles, the
oxidation and reduction products remain unclear. Further studies must
be conducted to elucidate the detailed organic products and reaction
mechanism.

Conclusions
Metal–semiconductor
composites were synthesized by preparing
BiVO4 and then conducting photodeposition of metal nanoparticles
in BiVO4. The photocatalytic activities of M–BiVO4 composites were evaluated based on the decomposition of MO
and mixed dye (MO and RhB) under UV–vis irradiation. The photocatalytic
efficiency was significantly enhanced when Pt deposition was used
as compared to the other M–BiVO4 samples. The catalytic
activity of BiVO4 semiconductors was not the main factor
in the efficiency of Pt–BiVO4. However, the deposited
Pt co-catalyst was essential for the photocatalytic dye decomposition
on the Pt–BiVO4 surface. A variety of radical scavengers
were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of the Pt–BiVO4 composite during the photocatalytic reaction. The results
indicate that the enhanced activity was mainly attributed to the •OH radicals that mediated oxidation during the dye
degradation on Pt at the BiVO4 surface.

Methods
Materials
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich),
NH4VO3 (99%,
Daejung Chemicals) poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (K 30, Daejung Chemicals)
were used as metal precursor salts and utilized as received. H2PtCl6·6H2O (≥37.50%, Sigma-Aldrich),
HAuCl4·3H2O (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich),
AgNO3 (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich), methyl orange (SHOWA),
RhB
(Daejung Chemicals), FTO (TEC 15, WY-GMS) coated glass, and methyl
alcohol (99.8%, Daejung Chemicals) were also used as received. Deionized
(DI) water was used as a solvent in all experiments.

Preparation
of BiVO4 Crystals
BiVO4 crystals were
prepared using a hydrothermal synthetic method. A
mixture of 20 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, NH4VO3, and 1.0 g PVP precursor in solution
(a mixture of 0.6 mL of 5 M NaOH and 35 mL of DI water) was prepared
and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.
The sealed autoclave was heated in an electric oven at 180 °C
for 6 h and then cooled to room temperature. The prepared powders
were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h (with a 2 h ramp time) in air
to form the BiVO4 crystals.

Photodeposition of Metals
(Pt, Au, Ag) on BiVO4 Crystals
The as-prepared
BiVO4 crystals were added to a 2 mM
metal precursor solution (H2PtCl6, HAuCl4, AgNO3) with a methanol hole scavenger. The reaction
mixture was stirred for 15 min under UV–vis illumination (light
intensity: 100 mW cm–2) to form the M–BiVO4 crystals. Ethanol (10 mL) was added to the M–BiVO4 suspension, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant
was removed. The residue was washed three times with ethanol (10 mL)
to provide yellow M–BiVO4 crystals.

Photocatalytic
Activity
In all tests, the intensity
of the lamp on the sample was measured as 100 mW cm–2 using a Si solar cell (AIST). Forty-eight milligrams of photocatalyst
and 80 mL of an aqueous solution of MO or a mixture solution (3:1
ratio of MO and RhB) were placed in a quartz photoreactor. Prior to
irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark
for 20 min to establish an absorption and desorption equilibrium between
the dyes and the surface of the catalyst under normal atmospheric
conditions. At given time intervals, aliquots of the mixed solution
were collected and centrifuged to remove the catalyst for analysis.
The residual concentration of dye was measured using a UV–vis
spectrometer.

Material Characterization
The BiVO4 samples
were characterized by SEM (Magellan 400, operated at 10 kV). TEM and
HRTEM were performed using a Talos F200X instrument at 200 kV. The
XRD pattern was measured using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and
300 mA (Rigaku, D/MAX-2500). The UV–vis–NIR absorption
spectra were acquired by a UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
using a solid sample holder for wavelengths from 300 to 1500 nm with
the FTO substrate as the reference. No unexpected or unusually high
safety hazards were encountered.
