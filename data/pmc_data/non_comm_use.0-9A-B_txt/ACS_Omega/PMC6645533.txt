We used density functional theory
approach, with the inclusion
of a semiempirical dispersion potential to take into account van der
Waals interactions, to investigate the water adsorption and dissociation
on cobalt sulfide Co9S8 and Co3S4(100) surfaces. We first determined the nanocrystal shape
and selected representative surfaces to analyze. We then calculated
water adsorption and dissociation energies, as well as hydrogen and
oxygen adsorption energies, and we found that sulfur vacancies on
Co9S8(100) surface enhance the catalytic activity
toward water dissociation by raising the energy level of unhybridized
Co 3d states closer to the Fermi level. Sulfur vacancies, however,
do not have a significant impact on the energetics of Co3S4(100) surface.

Introduction
Due to the depletion of carbon fossil
fuel together with the environmental
damage resulting from undesired emission from their combustion, finding
new energy carriers is becoming a necessity.1,2 Hydrogen
represents a clean and renewable alternative energy carrier and can
be used to replace to conventional and less environmental friendly
fuels.

The production of molecular hydrogen can be obtained
through water
splitting that currently represents the most energetically favorable
process, which however consists of only 4% of the total production
due to the inefficiency of the present catalysts.3−7 Another viable way is represented by thermal water
splitting, where the necessary temperatures can be typically generated
by either concentrating the sunlight or using waste heat from advanced
nuclear reactors. However, this process suffers from a low efficiency
due to the high temperatures, typically between 800 and 2500 K, necessary
to obtain a complete reaction cycle.8

Recent analysis reports transition-metal sulfides (TM–S)
that have interesting catalytic properties for several chemical processes,
showing a pronounced selectivity, which is a fundamental property
of a good catalyst. At the moment, the main technological application
of TM–S concerns the process of hydrogen desulfurization. However,
the primary step of the reaction shares hydrogen as a surface intermediate
with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and thus has a common elementary
step, suggesting that the same catalyst should, in principle, perform
well for both hydrogenation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).9

A particular class of interesting TM–S
compounds are cobalt
sulfides crystallized in pentlandite Co9S8 and
linnaeite Co3S4 forms.10,11 Recent studies show that Co9S8 and Co3S4 have catalytic activity and can be used in hydrogen
and oxygen evolution reactions, where Co is a catalytic center.12−15,17 These works also suggest that
a specific micro and nanostructuring of cobalt sulfide may significantly
increase its catalytic performance, as also known for CoS2.18 Pan et al. analyzed Co9S8 and Co3S4 for HER, and they experimentally
observed that spherelike Co3S4 exhibits better
electrocatalytic activity than the dandelion-like Co9S8 for HER.15 Sidik et al. carried
out theoretical investigations on (202) Co9S8 surface to analyze oxygen evolution reaction. They calculated the
strength of the interaction between the surfaces and water, molecular
oxygen, and hydroxyl radical, and they predicted non-negligible activity
for water oxidation, suggesting a possible use of this crystal surface
for water splitting.12 However, although
surface sulfur vacancies are often crucial in many catalytic processes
and they may significantly affect the energetics for of many catalytic
processes, their role in the catalytic activity of cobalt sulfides
is not yet clear.19,20

The mentioned works suggest
a potential use of Co9S8 and Co3S4 in water splitting; however,
an investigation of thermal driven processes toward H2 production
has not been carried out yet. Therefore, a study of the energetics
of water adsorption and dissociation on stoichiometric and reduced
cobalt sulfides, as well as hydrogen and oxygen adsorption, is crucial
to understand the potential application of these crystals in technological
applications. In particular, a detailed analysis of the adsorption
energies of water and its fragments for a given surface is fundamental,
since they provide excellent descriptors of the activation energy
for water dissociation on that surface toward water splitting.21

Here, we present a comparative investigation
of Co9S8 and Co3S4, with
a focus on the role
of sulfur vacancies in water dissociation and hydrogen evolution reaction.
We apply density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze water,
hydroxyl group, atomic oxygen, and atomic hydrogen adsorption energies
in view of having a deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of
the elementary processes that lead to HER. We compute electronic structure
analysis and investigate the relation between stoichiometry of cobalt
sulfides and catalytic properties for HER.

Calculation Methods
The calculations presented in this work are performed by using
a density functional theory approach, within the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
approach for the exchange–correlation term, and to describe
correctly van der Waals interactions arising from the interaction
of electric dipole moments, we include a correction as implemented
in the method of Grimme.22−24,29 We use periodic boundary conditions and a plane wave basis set as
implemented in VASP code, wherein the core–valence interaction
is described by projector augmented wave pseudopotential, with Co,
O, S, and H valence electron in d8s1, s2p4, s2p4, and s1 configuration, respectively.25−28,30,31 The cutoff energy for the valence electrons has been set at 500
eV, and (2 × 2 × 1) k-point mesh has been
used. Slabs consist of (2 × 1), (1 × 1), and (1 × 1)
expansion of the Co9S8(110), (111), and (100)
surfaces, respectively, and (1 × 1) expansion of the Co3S4(100), (110) and (111) surfaces, with a thickness of
12–15 atomic layers, and a vacuum gap of ∼30 Å.12,33 Full geometry optimization has been carried out for each system,
and the convergence criteria for the energy and forces are 10–5 eV and 10–2 eV/Å, respectively.
The energy barriers and transition states for water dissociation and
hydrogen formation are located by using the climbing image nudged
elastic band (NEB) method, which is an efficient method for searching
the minimum energy path connecting the given initial and final states.32 Although we report both pure GGA and GGA + vdW
results for readers’ reference, we develop our discussion on
the basis of the GGA + vdW results as this functional encompasses
more of the systems’ physics.

Results
Geometry and
Energetics
Among cobalt sulfide compounds,
the Co9S8 and Co3S4 structure
materials crystallize in a pentlandite Fm3̅m structure and linnaeite Fd3̅m, with lattice constants of 9.92 and 9.40 Å, respectively.
Our calculated lattice constants and formation energies are 9.80 Å
and −0.69 eV for Co9S8, and 9.29 Å
and −0.75 eV for (Co3S4), in line with
values reported in the literature.34−36 In both structures,
Co atoms occupy octahedral (Cooct) and tetrahedral (Cotetr) coordination, with a ratio of Cooct/Cotetr = 1:8 in Co9S8 and Cooct/Cotetr = 2:1 in Co3S4. Both crystals
have Co–Co bonds with interatomic distances equal to or less
than those in Co metal. The calculated Cooct–S and
Cotetr–S distances are 2.33 and 2.09–2.19
Å in Co9S8, whereas in Co3S4 Cotetr–S, 2.00 Å and Cooct–S, 2.31 Å.34−36 Due to the symmetry of each surface,
there is significant geometrical reconstruction of the three surfaces
from the bulk cut, with a bond length change up to ∼0.1 Å,
as reported in other works.12 On the basis
of crystallographic planes, many different surface compositions are
possible for the pentlandite structure so we analyze a number of terminations
for each orientation and report here the energetics of representative
ones (see Table 1).
We calculate the surface energy for each surface termination, which
corresponds to the energy required to create a surface from the bulk
structure, as follows 1  where A is the surface
area, Eslab is the free energy of the
slab used in
the calculations, and Ebulk is the free
energy of the bulk. M and N are
the number of atoms in each slab and in the bulk, respectively.

By minimizing the total surface energy of a hypothetical
particle
of a given volume with respect to the energy of each calculated surface
termination, we determine the nanoparticle geometry, as in the Wulff
construction method, and show the predicted nanoparticles in Figure 1. The resulting particle
shapes show that, in thermodynamic conditions, the surfaces exposed
to the environment are (100) and (111) for Co9S8 and (100) and (110) for Co3S4. However, here,
we focus our analysis of catalytic properties on the (100) surface,
since it presents similar geometrical structure in both materials
that enable us to highlight the intrinsic difference in the electronic
structure and potential catalytic activity.

construction, considering the surface energies reported in Table 1. Yellow, blue, and
red facets indicate (111), (110), and (100) surface terminations,
respectively.

Both surfaces contain
a mixture of Co and S sites; however, the
main structural differences between Co9S8(100)
and Co3S4(100) are the Co/S rate, which is 1:4
in Co9S8 and 1:2 in Co3S4(100), and that, although Co3S4 only exposes
Cooct, Co9S8 exposes a mixture of
Cooct and Cotetr with dominance of Cotetr, as shown in Figure 2.

ions. In the picture, Cotetr and Cooct indicate

Adsorption Energies and Geometries
Although in realistic
conditions water splitting and HER can present several intermediate
phases, we are interested in analyzing the fundamental steps of the
following total reaction 2  During thermal
decomposition, the first step
of eq 2 has been described
in terms of water dissociation form adsorbed H (H2O →
Had + OHad). Then, eventually, two adsorbed
surface hydrogens next to each other react to form H2 (Had + Had → H2).37−39 The direct
thermal splitting of water will require temperatures of ∼2500
K, which makes its practical application very challenging. The fundamental
limitation of the thermal splitting of liquid water is the fact that
the ground state of oxygen is in a triplet spin configuration, whereas
the ground state of water is in a singlet spin configuration. Therefore,
breaking a water molecule requires a substantial quantity of energy
to excite the molecule to a higher spin state before the dissociation.
However, by exploiting the catalytic properties of some surfaces,
water dissociation and molecular hydrogen formation can be achieved
at temperatures below ∼1300 K.40

In view of this, we can identify the required necessary characteristics
of a good catalyst as follows: it must be able to dissociate water
and attract protons and at the same time still be able to desorb H2. Experimentally, HER activity can be correlated to calculated
hydrogen adsorption energies from density functional theory (DFT),
where high activity corresponds to low Gibbs free energy of hydrogen
adsorption (ΔGH).42,43 This is because a lower ΔGH results
in a strong binding of the atomic hydrogen and prevents desorption
of H2, whereas higher ΔGH prevents the binding of atomic hydrogen on the catalyst surfaces.
Accordingly, ΔGH is considered as
a good descriptor of HER activity and good catalysts are expected
to have very small value of ΔGH.
On the other hand, to have an efficient reaction, water must be strongly
adsorbed and easily split on the surface. Therefore, the total reaction
should have a high water dissociation energy and at the same time,
low hydrogen adsorption energy. We calculate the zero point energy
upon adsorption to be ∼0.4 eV H and ∼0.1 eV for H2O, OH, and O, calculated considering the vibrational frequencies
of the species in gas phase and those of the outermost surface atomic
layer. Although this contribution to the total energy is significant,
it is very similar in the two systems and therefore it will not give
considerable additional information to this comparative analysis.
Also, we adopt the approach used by Muhich et al. They suggest using
a “benchmark” material to predict the H2 production
capacities of given materials,41 which
is chosen as a standard against which to compare reduction enthalpies
of candidate materials within a similar thermal water splitting class
(i.e., a similar reaction mechanism). They assume that within a thermal
water splitting reaction class, the reduction entropy of the benchmark
materials is approximately the same. Therefore, when comparing the
relative equilibrium extents of reduction between the two materials,
the entropic terms cancel. According to these considerations, here,
we approximate ΔG ≅ ΔE.

We calculate adsorption energies values for H2O, OH,
O, and H adsorption energies, as follows 3  where Esurf+mol, Esurf, and Emol are the energies of the molecule–surface system,
the surface, and molecule in gas phase, respectively whereas N is the number of molecules adsorbed per supercell.

We obtain a minimum energy configuration for stoichiometric surfaces
when water adsorbs on the top of Co atom in a flat configuration with
the hydrogen atoms stretched toward sulfur sites, whereas OH adsorbs
at Co site in a planar configuration, as schematically depicted in Figure 3. Atomic oxygen and
hydrogen adsorb favorably at cobalt and sulfur sites, respectively.
Upon vacancy formation, water adsorbs on the top of the vacancy with
the hydrogen pointing upward, whereas hydroxyl group and atomic oxygen
fill the vacancy, as depicted in Figure 4. Representative atomic distances upon adsorption
on stoichiometric and reduced surfaces are listed in Table 4.

and hydrogen atoms.

Here, blue, yellow, red, and white spheres represent, respectively,
cobalt, sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms.

Now let us examine how VS alters the adsorption
energies
on these two surfaces based on adsorption energies reported in Tables 2 and 3. We calculated the energy gain from a single water molecule
dissociation, from the difference between OH–H adsorption,
schematically represented in Figure 5, and the water molecule in gas phase. We obtain energy
values of −1.02 and −0.98 eV on Co9S8 and Co3S4, respectively, indicating
a very similar trend of the stoichiometric surfaces. On the other
hand, when the same value is calculated for the reduced surfaces,
we obtain an energy of −0.91 eV on Co9S8 and −0.20 eV on Co3S4, suggesting a
significant difference of the energy trend of the reduced surfaces.
The same conclusion can be reached also if we consider the energy
balance of water dissociation reaction calculated from the separate
H2O, OH, and H adsorption energies, which gives an additional
insight on the surface properties, since it takes into account the
surface–adsorbate interaction strength of the individual species.
The energy gain from splitting one H2O molecule is 2.71
eV for stoichiometric Co9S8 and 2.44 eV for
stoichiometric Co3S4. Since these values are
comparable to each other, the overall performance is then determined
by the H absorption energy; the smaller it is, the better an H generator
the surface is. Consequently, stoichiometric Co3S4 with H adsorption energy 0.23 eV smaller than that of Co9S8 is predicted to have superior HER performance. This
prediction is indeed in agreement with previous calculations done
by Pan et al.15 The introduction of VS, on the other hand, significantly increases the energy gain
from water dissociation on Co9S8 surface compared
to that on Co3S4 surface. In this case, the
energy gain is 6.25 eV for Co9S8 and 4.94 eV
for Co3S4. As a result, the energy gain upon
water dissociation would be significantly higher on reduced Co9S8 surface. Nonetheless, one should note that introduction
of VS also strengthens the adsorption hydrogen by lowering
the H adsorption energy from −2.22 eV on stoichiometric Co9S8 surface to −3.00 eV on reduced Co9S8 surface. However, the energy gain in the first
step of the reaction, that is water dissociations, would probably
offset the enhanced H adsorption. As a result, we expect that the
introduction of VS makes Co9S8 an
efficient catalyst.

On the other hand, upon water dissociation, OH group is adsorbed
favorably at VS, filling the gap left from sulfur atom,
with a strong adsorption energy of −4.24 and −3.34 eV,
at the vacancy site. The high adsorption energies suggest a possible
poisoning mechanism that will cancel the effect of the vacancy on
the reaction energy balance. However, we calculated that hydrogen
dissociation from OH will leave an oxygen atom trapped at the sulfur
site with energies of −2.81 and −2.16 eV on the Co9S8 and Co3S4, respectively.
As summarized in eq 2, we expect oxygen atoms to react to form molecular oxygen. Upon
O2 formation, we calculated a reduction of ∼1 eV
when the trapped oxygen reacts to form O2. Considering
that this is a natural path of the total reaction under operating
conditions, the energy values calculated for O2 desorption
from VS suggest that the possible poisoning effect strongly
depends on the operating temperature of the catalyst, which should
ideally allow molecular oxygen desorption from the sulfur vacancy
site.

To estimate the vacancy concentration and real stoichiometry
of
the surface in thermodynamic conditions, we calculated the vacancy
formation energy as follows 4  If calculated with respect to the atomic sulfur
atom, the cost to create a vacancy is Co9S8(100)
is 5.07 eV and in Co3S4(100) is 4.43 eV, whereas
the same value calculated with respect to the sulfur S8 drops to 2.65 eV in Co3S4 and 2.01 eV in Co3S4, suggesting that in sulfur-rich conditions at
operating temperature, the concentration of vacancies is relatively
low.

However, the chemical potential of sulfur, controlled through
temperature
and partial pressure during synthesis, determines the abundance of
sulfur vacancy at the surface. To have an insight into the sulfur
vacancy formation and stability, we use the energy values calculated
using DFT within the ab initio atomistic thermodynamics framework,
as reported in the literature.44,45 We calculate the surface
energy as follows 5  where G is the surface energy
of the slab with surface area A and the factor  is due to the presence of two surfaces,
one on each side of the slab. μi(pi, T) is the pressure
and temperature-dependent chemical potential of the various species i present in the system; in this case, i = Co and S. Ni is the
total number of atoms in the component i of the system. Figure 6 shows the surface
energies of reduced and stoichiometric Co9S8 and Co3S4. We find that for values of μS ≤ −6.78 and −9.64 eV, the reduced surfaces
of Co9S8 and Co3S4 become
stable if compared with the stoichiometric ones, suggesting a possible
viable way to create conditions for the fabrication of reduced structures
for both crystals. Using the definition of universal chemical potential
for sulfur vapor formulated by Jackson et al., we converted, for a
given partial pressure of sulfur in gas conditions, our energy values
into temperature, and we found the transition between the stoichiometric
and reduced surface to occur at ∼360 and ∼410 K at p = 1 atm, for Co9S8 and Co3S4, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.46

Figure 6 Calculated
surface free energy of stoichiometric and reduced Co9S8(100) and Co3S4(100) surfaces
as a function of the sulfur chemical potential μS. In the additional bars, the chemical potential of sulfur has been
converted to temperature at two different partial pressures of the
sulfur, 1 and 0.01 atm, respectively.


To have an insight into the reaction kinetics, we calculate
the
activation energies of water dissociation and molecular hydrogen formation
by employing NEB method and schematically report the results in Figure 2. Interestingly,
we found that the formation of molecular hydrogen is exothermic and
that its activation energy is lower at Co3S4(100) than at Co9S8(100).16 The energy reaction profile shows how both water splitting
and hydrogen formation are exothermic reaction, with the exception
of water dissociation onto defective Co3S4(100).
However, since the total reaction indicated in eq 2 is endothermic, an intermediate step is supposed
to be highly endothermic. We found one possible endothermic step to
be OH dissociation, with an energy value of ∼0.80 eV in Co9S8 and ∼1.80 eV in Co3S4, as indicated by the energy values reported in Tables 2 and 3. Our results indicates that vacancy assists the reactions by decreasing
the barriers in both crystals; however, hydrogen formation is kinetically
favored on Co3S4 (Table 4).

Electronic Structure

Here, we report
the analysis of
the electronic structure of the two surfaces in their stoichiometric
and reduced form (Figure 7). Figures 8 and 9 show the projected density of states
(pDOS) of surface cobalt and sulfur atoms in the stoichiometric slabs,
together with the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) analysis.
Our electronic structure calculations show that Co9S8 and Co3S4 have similar density of state
function around the Fermi level, in line with the ability of the sulfide
to conduct electronic currents. Both surfaces show a pronounced Co
3d peak right below the Fermi energy and an evident hybridization
with the S 3p in a broad range. COOP analysis suggests the formation
of bonding states below the Fermi energy at ∼−2 eV.

surfaces. (c) COOP analysis of the surface Co–S bond.

Interestingly, upon sulfur vacancy
formation, Co9S8 and Co3S4 show different features (see Figures 10 and 11). We calculated
the site-projected pDOS for low-coordinated
cobalt atoms adjacent to the sulfur vacancy and high-coordinated cobalt
atoms distant from the vacancy for both surfaces. In reduced Co3S4, there is no significant difference between
the two on site pDOS. However, reduced Co9S8 shows a significant difference in the intensity of the two peaks
at the Fermi energy, with the 3d states of the cobalt atoms adjacent
to the vacancy showing an intensity significantly higher than that
by the ones distant from the vacancy, which suggests a relation with
the higher catalytic activity for water dissociation in reduced Co9S8.

This result is in line with some
hypothesis reported in the literature
that suggests a relation between high HOMO occupancy at Fermi and
catalytic activity.47−49 Harris et al. correlated the t2g-HOMO
occupation, the TM–S bond covalence and the TM–S bond
strength with the catalytic activity.50 The more electrons in a t2g-HOMO, at comparable bond
strength, the better is the catalytic activity. Furthermore, Smit
et al. performed DFT calculations on octahedral TM–S clusters,
confirming the suggested trend between the strength of interaction
between the metal 3d and the S 3p electrons and the catalytic activity.51

To analyze the bonding nature of Co–S,
we determined the
COOP by multiplying the sign of two overlapping atomic wavefunctions
by the corresponding DOS, providing additional information regarding
the bonding character: positive and negative values indicate bonding
and antibonding interactions, respectively. Our COOP analysis suggests
that for both surfaces in their stoichiometric forms, Co 3d S 3p bonding
state below the Fermi energy reaches ∼−2 eV. Upon vacancy
formation, we notice the presence of a nonbonding state around ∼−1.5
eV in Co9S8, whereas there is no significant
change in Co3S4. The formation of a nonbonding
state may suggest the presence of unhybridized d orbitals in reduced
Co9S8 that enhance catalytic activity. This
is also supported by the geometric features of the two surfaces that,
upon vacancy formation, presents surface III and IV coordinate Co
atoms in Co9S8 and IV and V coordinated Co atoms
in Co3S4.

This result, being in line with
the pDOS assumption of Smit et
al. and Harris et al., suggests a possible enhanced catalytic activity
of reduced Co9S8 with respect to its stoichiometric
form, whereas the same trend is not predicted for Co3S4, confirming our conclusions presented in the previous section.
In conclusion, the present work suggests that reduced Co9S8 surfaces could potentially represent suitable catalysts
for water spitting and hydrogen evolution.

on Co9S8(100) and Co3S4(100), and we found that in Co9S8, sulfur vacancies
play an important role in catalytic activity. On the basis of the
adsorption bond strengths of the reactants, reaction intermediates,
and products of water dissociation, Co9S8(100)
and Co3S4(100) result to be particularly active
for water dissociation. Furthermore, we predict that nanostructured
nonstoichiometric Co9S8 will show an increased
activity due to the low coordination of octahedral Co centers that
act as active water adsorption and dissociations sites, potentially
increasing the efficiency toward HER. This conclusion is supported
by the electronic structure analysis. The projected density of states
shows intense peaks around the Fermi energy for the low-coordinated
tetragonal Co centers only in Co9S8. The increased
water adsorption energies upon vacancy formation reflect in the increased
HOMO occupancy of the low-coordinated tetrahedral Co. However, this
is not seen in Co3S4 where vacancies do not
significantly improve water adsorption and dissociation energies and
do not increase the Co center DOS around the Fermi energy. The inclusion
of dispersion potentials to the conventional Kohn–Sham DFT
energy results in a decrease of the adsorption energies of ∼15%.
However, this effect is relatively larger in water, identifying the
vdW character of the interaction. Our results suggest that nanostructured
nonstoichiometric Co9S8 could in principle act
as a low-temperature catalyst or co-catalyst for HER and that a test
on nanoengineered surfaces is worthwhile.

Appendix A
In the previous section, we show the projected
density of states
of the two systems, comparing them. However, DFT calculations are
not able to catch the d–d splitting into eg and
t2g states, resulting in an overlap of degenerate 3d states.
To have a correct description of the electronic structure, Hubbard
correction should be introduced. However, at the moment, there is
no unique choice of U that gives a satisfactory description
of both the electronic structure and the energetics of the system
for molecular adsorption. Also, it is not clear if the the Hubbard
correction provides a systematic improvement of molecular adsorption
energies if compared to DFT. Also, self-consistent methods to determine U cannot find a good agreement with experimental values.52 As pointed out by Da Silva et al., for similar
systems, there is no unique choice of U that at the
same time gives a reasonable description of structural parameters,
relative energies, and spectroscopic properties.53 However, in this section, we report the projected density
of states by using DFT + U (U(Co
3d) = 5 eV) to test if vacancy formation has the same effect on HOMO
at the Fermi level.54

Figure 12 shows
pDOS of stoichiometric and reduced Co9S8 and
Co3S4. We obtain a d–d splitting for
Cotetr of ∼2 eV, in line with the experimental value.
Here, HOMO occupancy at Fermi is higher in reduced than stoichiometric
Co9S8. This effect is not seen in Co3S4, confirming that our conclusions drawn in Electronic Structure by using by using pure GGA–DFT
are adequate and correct.

Figure 12 Projected DOS of (a) Co9S8 3d and (b) Co3S4 3d calculated by using DFT
+ U. Red and green lines represent stoichiometric
and reduced surfaces,
respectively.

Appendix B
We performed convergence tests for the cutoff
and the k-point set, as shown in Figure 13. It can be seen that convergence
to within 0.1 eV
is obtained for a k-point sampling in the Brillouin
zone of 2 × 2 × 1 compared with the 4 × 4 × 1 k-point set. With regard to the plane wave cutoff energy
of 500 eV, employed in all our calculations, Figure 13 shows that compared with a cut–cut
of 600 eV, the total energy is converged within 0.005 eV. This setup
leads to an error on the adsorption energies within 0.01 eV.

Figure 13 Change in
the total energy vs increasing k-point
mesh (top) and cutoff energy (bottom) for Co9S8(100) (red line) and Co3S4(100) (blue line).
