First-principles density functional
theory calculations are performed
to study the stability and electronic properties of hydrogenated and
fluorinated two-dimensional sp3 boron phosphide (BP) and
boron arsenide (BAs). As expected, the phonon dispersion spectrum
and phonon density of states of hydrogenated and fluorinated BX (X
= P, As) systems are found to be different, which can be attributed
to the different masses of hydrogen and fluorine. Hydrogenated BX
systems bear larger and indirect band gaps and are found to be different
from fluorinated BX systems. These derivatives can be utilized in
hydrogen storage applications and ultrafast electronic devices. Finally,
we investigated the stability and electronic properties of stacked
bilayers of functionalized BP. Interestingly, we found that these
systems display strong interlayer interactions, which impart strong
stability. In contrast with the electronic properties determined for
the fluorinated/hydrogenated monolayers, we found that the electronic
properties of these bilayers can finely be tuned to a narrow gap semiconductor,
metallic or nearly semimetallic one by selecting a suitable arrangement
of layers. Moreover, the nearly linear dispersion of the conduction
band edge and the heavy-, light-hole bands are the interesting characteristics.
Furthermore, the exceptional values of effective masses assure the
fast electronic transport, making this material very attractive to
construct electronic devices.

1 Introduction
The
groundbreaking scotch tape experiment of successful isolation
of graphene opened a new research area of two-dimensional (2D) materials.1 Since then, many 2D materials are predicted by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations followed by their experimental
synthesis. Furthermore, modification of the existing materials can
lead to some exciting properties, especially in the case of graphene.2−5 The chemical modification of graphene is a common practice for which
radicals such as hydrogen (H),6−8 oxygen (O),9 fluorine,10−12 and so forth are adsorbed on graphene. These adsorbates
can take the form of an irregular pattern in graphene oxide2 or systematic motifs in hydrogenated graphene
(graphane)3,7,8 and fluorinated
graphene10−12 (fluorographene).5 Moreover,
these modifications can significantly alter the electronic properties
of graphene as both graphane and fluorographene are considered to
be wide band gap semiconductors. However, the list is not limited
to that because new/modified materials come with a number of applications,
thus causing the advancement of the present technologies.13−16 Some of these materials with exceptional properties include (but
are not limited to) stanene,17,18 Nb2O3,19 plumbene,20 arsenene,21 and silicene.22,23

Soon after the exfoliation of graphene, the synthesis of monolayer
III–V binary compounds became a sizzling area of research with
a particular interest toward the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).24−32 By virtue of its wide band gap, h-BN has lots of potential applications
in nanoelectronics to be used as a dielectric material, ultraviolet
light emitter, and oxidation-resistant coating.13−21

Another III–V binary compound that joined the league
is
hexagonal boron phosphide (h-BP).24,33 Despite the
fact that it is not yet synthesized experimentally, it is already
in the focus of theoretical studies. The geometric structure of h-BP
is identical to that of graphene and h-BN, whereas two heterogeneous
species (B and P) share the unit cell causing the breaking of symmetry
and resulting in a band gap opening of 0.82–1.81 eV depending
on the employed level of theory. Another material that is analogous
to h-BP is hexagonal boron arsenide (h-BAs)34 having a band gap opening of 0.71 eV at local density approximation
and 1.24 eV at GW0 levels of theory. Both these systems
are found to be stable as predicted by the phonon dispersion spectrum.
In this paper, we study the hydrogenation and fluorination of 2D BP
and BAs, their effects on stability, and structural and electronic
properties with the help of DFT calculations. To the best of our knowledge,
the literature lacks such an investigation. In the following, we demonstrate
that these systems display unique stability and electronic properties,
which can be fine-tuned when fluorinated and hydrogenated BX layers
are stacked, X = P, As.

2 Results and Discussion
Initially, we optimized h-BP and h-BAs to check the validity of
our computational procedure. The bond lengths and lattice parameters
were in good agreement with the previous studies.24,33 We also reproduced the band structures by employing the Γ–M–K–Γ path showing
excellent agreement with the reported literature. In the next step,
we studied the hydrogenation and fluorination of BX in chair conformation
as this is the most favorable configuration in the case of graphane
and fluorographene.11 After the introduction
of these radicals, the planar BX structures are altered to the puckered
ones. The very same happens to graphene by the addition of these radicals.

2.1 Structural Properties
In the case
of H–BP/F–BP, the lattice parameters and B–P
bond lengths are found to be 3.199 Å/3.272 Å and 1.93 Å/1.99
Å, respectively. The distances of H from B and P are found to
be 1.22 and 1.43 Å, respectively. The F–B bond length
is found to be 1.39 Å, whereas the F–P bond length is
as large as 1.61 Å. The H/F–P distance is almost 0.21
Å larger than the H/F–B distance. As discussed above,
these structures are no longer planar and, therefore, we calculated
the buckling height difference and found that B–P is 0.56 and
0.628 Å apart, in the case of H–BP and F–BP, respectively.
Additionally, the lattice parameters and B–As bond lengths
are calculated to be 3.414 Å/3.499 Å and 2.06 Å/2.12
Å for H–BAs and F–BAs, respectively. These larger
lattice parameters (in comparison with the BP ones) can be attributed
to the bigger covalent radius of As. The difference in the lattice
parameters of H–BP and F–BP is 0.073 Å, whereas
in the case of H–BAs and F–BAs, this difference is a
bit larger (0.085 Å). Furthermore, the H–B (1.21 Å)
and H–As (1.53 Å) bonds are smaller than the F–B
(1.39 Å) and F–As (1.77 Å) bonds. In addition to
this, the height between B and As is found to be 0.6 and 0.636 Å
in H–BAs and F–BAs, respectively. It should be noted
that both the sides of BX were functionalized, so there is no need
to introduce a substrate. However, in the case where the use of a
substrate is necessary, help can be taken from a very nice literature
reported recently.35 All these geometric
structures can be seen in Figure 1.

(c) H–BAs,
and (d) F–BAs derivatives.

2.2 Cohesive Strength
In order to assess
the strength of these derivatives, cohesive energies are calculated
and compared with the pristine BX cases. The expression used is given
as  where nx and Ex are the
number and gas-phase energy of the atom type x, whereas N is the total number of atoms in the simulation box. Finally, Etot is the total energy of the system under
study. It is found that fluorination causes a minor reduction in the
cohesive energy (CE) of BP in comparison with the pristine cases,
whereas for BAs, fluorination increases the CE. On the contrary, hydrogenation
significantly reduces the CE by 0.86 and 0.60 eV for BP and BAs, respectively.
The CE analysis shows that the fluorinated derivatives can be equally
stable as compared to their parent compounds. The summary of cohesive
energies and formation energies (FEs) is shown in Table 1.

2.3 Dynamical Stability
In order to check
whether these derivatives are dynamically stable or not, the phonon
spectrum is calculated within the density functional perturbation
theory36 with 8 × 8 × 1 q-points. The presence of a negative frequency is the sign
of instability, and in this regard, all the calculated derivatives
are stable as they all lack negative frequencies as can be seen from
the phonon band spectrum along with the corresponding phonon density
of states (PhDOS). The high-frequency modes in hydrogenated systems
are sufficiently higher in frequency as compared to the fluorinated
counterparts. The higher-frequency modes in H–BP and H–BAs
are in the frequency range of around 2500 cm–1,
the latter being a bit higher. This higher-frequency degenerate mode
in pristine h-BP/h-BAs appears at a frequency around 1000 cm–1/840 cm–1. Furthermore, this degenerate mode splits
into two modes in H–BP, and even more prominently in H–BAs.
The phonon spectrum of hydrogenated and fluorinated systems differs
from each other, which can be attributed to the different atomic masses
of H and F. Additionally, the intensities of hydrogenated systems
are higher than those of fluorinated counterparts as can be seen from
PhDOS. It is evident from the phonon spectrum/DOS that the phonon
can be bifurcated into high-, intermediate-, and low-frequency groups
not only for hydrogenated cases but also for fluorinated cases. This
characteristic is missing in fluorographene37 where the clear separated groups are absent. Consequently, the H–BX
and F–BX systems can be as stable as derivatives just like
graphane and fluorographene. The phonon plots can be seen in Figure 2 where these low-,
intermediate-, and high-frequency groups are in the range of ∼500,
∼1000, and ∼2500, respectively, for the HBX system.
However, these groups span over a (bit) wider range for HBP in comparison
with FBAs. For the sack of brevity, the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency
groups are colored as red, blue, and violet, respectively, in phonon
bands.

H–BP, (b) F–BP, (c) H–BAs, and (d) F–BAs.
The absence of negative frequencies guarantees the stability of these
derivatives.

2.4 Kinetic
Stability
Ab initio molecular
dynamic (AIMD) simulations are carried out to assess the thermal stability
of these derivatives. We constructed a 4 × 4 unit cell to perform
MD at 300, 600, 900, and 1500 K. We use the SIESTA code and the vdW-DF
level of theory. The simulations last for 1 fs and are divided into
1000 steps. The NVT ensemble is used with a Nose–Hoover
thermostat.41 Snapshots of the final steps
at various temperatures are shown in Figure 3. The excellent high-temperature stabilities
of these derivatives except the F–BAs at 1500 K guarantee their
applications in high-temperature operating devices. Furthermore, the
average changes in bonds and angles are depicted in Table S1. Moreover, the stability of some structures was also
confirmed by examining them for 2 ps at 1500 K.

(c) H–BAs, and (d) F–BAs.

2.5Electronic Properties of F–BX and H–BX (X =
P, As)
The electronic band structures and projected density
of states (PDOS) are calculated, and it is found that these derivatives
possess different electronic properties in comparison with each other
and also with the pristine case.24 The
calculated band gaps of h-BP and h-BAs are found to be 1.10 and 0.89
eV, respectively. These band gaps appear at K and are of direct nature.
However, the band gaps of H–BX are of indirect nature, being
the valence band maximum (VBM) at Γ and conduction band minimum
(CBM) at Γ–M. The computed band gaps
of H–BP and H–BAs are 3.89 and 3.50 eV, respectively.
Furthermore, PDOS shows that there is a negligible contribution of
H to the DOS at VBM or CBM in H–BP. However, in H–BAs,
a significant contribution of H to the DOS can be seen, which hybridized
mostly with B 2p in valence and with As 4p in the conduction band.
F–BP and F–BAs show a band gap opening of 1.53 and 1.25
eV, respectively. Nevertheless, these are direct gaps induced at the
Γ point. Moreover, the VBM in both the cases has twofold degeneracy.
The P 3p orbitals hybridized with B 2p and F 4p at VBM and CBM, being
the P 3p contribution a bit more at CBM. Nearly, the same picture
can be seen in the case of F–BAs, where more contribution comes
from the As 4p orbitals. Besides, the curvature at CBM and VBM in
F–BP and especially in F–BAs is likely to have exceptional
mobilities. These show that F–BX systems can be utilized in
ultrafast electronic devices. The band structures along with corresponding
PDOS are plotted as shown in Figure 4. For the sake of completeness, we also studied the
mixed monolayers: HBPF, FBPH, FBAsF, and FBAsH. Interestingly, these
systems present band gaps which are bracketed by the ones computed
for F–BX and H–BX. Therefore, using Janus-type functionalization,
it is possible to obtain a finer tuning of the band gap.

plus polarization (DZP) level, along with the respective PDOS plots
for (a) H–BP, (b) F–BP, (c) H–BAs, and (d) F–BAs.
The Fermi energy is set to zero.

2.6Stability and Electronic Properties of Mixed Bilayers
In a recent work, we showed that it is possible to adjust the band
gap of functionalized silicene if two layers are stacked.23 In this line, we have considered the case of
stacking one layer of H–BP onto F–BP. There are four
possible stacking possibilities for these systems which are shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Optimized unit
cells for the bilayer systems formed by the stacking
of one H–BP layer onto F–BP.

In the case of BP, we found that the four combinations have
very
similar energy, the most stable one being that which combines HBPH:::FBPF
(see Figure 6). This
structure is only 0.002 eV/atom more stable than HPBH:::FBPF. The
remaining two of structures are in the same range of stability. Interestingly,
these systems are expected to be very stable because the fluorine
and hydrogen atoms of different layers are expected to interact through
F:::H hydrogen bonds because the fluorine atoms are negatively charged
while the hydrogen atoms bear a positive charge. For example, in the
case of HBPH:::FBPF, according to Mulliken analysis, the H atom bonded
to P has a positive charge of +0.1 e while the F atom bonded to B
bears a negative charge equal to −0.3 e–,
at the M06-L/6-311G* level of theory. Additionally, these outcomes
are in accordance with the lower (higher) electronegativity of H (F).
Thus, we can expect a strong interaction between monolayers. The interlayer
interaction energy (IE) of HBPH:::FBPF is 0.015 eV/atom, at the M06-L/6-31G*
level of theory. This value is only 0.06 eV/atom smaller than the
stacking interaction computed for bilayer graphene using the same
methodology. With regard to the electronic properties, we have found
that the band gaps of monolayers were significantly reduced when stacked.
For example, HBPH:::FBPF and HBPH:::FPBF are metals, while the HPBH:::FPBF
has a band gap of 0.38 eV. Perhaps the most interesting case is HPBH:::FBPF,
which is a small band gap semiconductor (0.04 eV) featuring somewhat
linear dispersion at the CBM. Furthermore, the VBM is composed of
heavy-hole and light-hole bands. To further gain insights, we calculated
the effective masses of electrons and holes from the curvature of
conduction and valence bands. The calculated value of the effective
mass of electrons is 0.027m0. Furthermore,
the effective mass of the heavy-hole band is computed to be 0.045m0, while that of the light-hole band is as low
as 0.014m0. These exceptional values are
the surety of remarkable electronic transport in these bilayers. Consequently,
these materials become critically attractive to develop BP-based fast
nanoelectronic materials.

3 Conclusions
The hydrogenation and fluorination
of h-BP and h-BAs are studied
by means of DFT calculations. The vibrational properties are found
to be different from their parent compounds. The hydrogenated and
fluorinated BX (X = P, As) systems are likely to have the comparable
stabilities as compared to graphane and fluorographene, respectively.
The AIMD simulations suggest that these derivatives can be stable
at temperatures as high as 1500 K with the sole exception of F–BAs.
Just like the vibrational properties, their electronic properties
are also different from h-BP/h-BAs and from each other. The H–BX
systems show larger and indirect band gaps in comparison with the
F–BX counterparts. The former can have applications in hydrogen
storage devices, while the latter can be utilized in ultrafast electronic
devices. Finally, we investigated the stability and electronic properties
of stacked bilayers of functionalized BP. Interestingly, we found
that these systems display strong interlayer interactions, which turn
them very stable. In contrast with the electronic properties determined
for the fluorinated/hydrogenated monolayers, we found that the bilayers
have some exciting characteristics, such as nearly linear dispersion
of the conduction band and heavy- and light-hole bands. By virtue
of these interesting properties, these bilayers can find applications
in fast nanoelectronic devices.

4 Methods
All the calculations are performed with quantum espresso (QE),38,39 SIESTA,40,41 and Gaussian42 codes which are based on DFT methods. We use the projector-augmented
wave43 method and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)44 flavor of the generalized gradient
approximation to describe the exchange and correlation in QE. The
dispersion-corrected PBE-D245 scheme is
used. The kinetic energy cutoff for the expansion of wave function
is set to 60 Ry and 8 times of this value is set for charge densities.
The force-convergence criterion is set to 10–5 Ry/bohr
with the energy criteria of 10–12 Ry. We utilized
the PBEsol46 and PBE pseudopotentials (PPs)
for BP and BAs, respectively, from the Standard Solid-State Pseudopotentials
library.47 The vdW-DF48,49 calculations are carried out as implemented in the SIESTA code.
The norm-conserving Troullier–Martins PPs were utilized in
their complete separable form.50 The basis
set selected was the DZP polarization functions. The mesh cutoff is
200 Ry in all the calculations. In the case of the calculations performed
with SIESTA, geometry optimization is followed until the forces were
less than 0.01 eV/Å. The unit cell is sampled with a 30 ×
30 × 1 grid of k-points. The vacuum region along
the z-axis is fixed to 20 Å. The M06-L/6-31G*51 and HSEH1PBE/6-31G*52 geometry optimizations are carried out with Gaussian 09 using the
default convergence criteria.28 The ultrafine
grid was selected, and 3000 k-points were used to
sample the unit cell. From now and onward, H–BX and F–BX
will be used for monolayer hydrogenated and fluorinated BX, respectively,
and X being P and As. Interlayer IEs were calculated as IE = [E(bilayer) – E(monolayer 1) – E(monolayer 2)]/Natoms, where E(bilayer) is the energy of the bilayered system and E(monolayer) corresponds to the energy of the isolated monolayers
which form the bilayer. FEs were calculated as53 FE = E(Z–BX–Y) μB
– μX – μZ – μY, where E(Z–BX–Y) is the energy of the monolayer and
μB, μX, μZ, and μY are the chemical potentials
of the atoms involved. In all cases, we selected the energies of the
isolated atoms as a reference.
