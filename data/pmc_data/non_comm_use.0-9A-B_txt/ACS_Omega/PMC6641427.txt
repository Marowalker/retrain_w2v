Reconfigurable optical
materials are critical to realizing light
control in eyewear or architectural windows. Here, we report on the
electrical reconfiguration of the selective reflection of cholesteric
liquid crystals (LCs). The distinctive responses detailed here are
enabled by the preparation of a structurally chiral polymer stabilizing
network that enforces anchoring of a low-molar-mass liquid crystalline
media with positive dielectric anisotropy. The pitch of the reflective
optical elements is directly regulated by a dc field, resulting in
red or blue reflection wavelength tuning or broadening. The use of
the positive dielectric LC host in concert with optimization of the
material preparation conditions allows for reorientation of the LC
molecules to achieve an optically clear state (homeotropic orientation)
by the application of an ac field. In this way, the selective reflection
of the optical elements can be moved, widened, and turned on and off.
The electro-optic characteristics of these materials are another step
forward to enabling the use of these materials in optics and photonics.

Introduction
Reconfiguration of
the optical properties of materials enables
functional performance benefits in consumer goods, automobiles, and
aerospace systems. Dynamic changes to optical material properties
including absorption, diffraction, reflection, and scatter have been
the subject to intense research. Various stimuli are capable of triggering
optical reconfiguration of these properties including heat, light,
chemical, and electric field. Chromic devices (photochromic and electrochromic)
are increasingly widespread in light control applications as wearables
or in windows.

Liquid crystalline materials, pervasive in the
display industry,
are synonymous with stimuli-induced reconfiguration of optical properties.
Of particular interest is the inherent and selective reflection of
the cholesteric liquid crystal (LC) phase.1,2 This
phase forms naturally in chiral liquid crystalline molecules but is
more commonly formulated via chirality transfer from a dopant to a
nematic LC host.3−6 In this way, the spectral properties of this phase are governed
by the composition of the formulation and can be readily adjusted
to prepare optical elements across the electromagnetic spectrum (UV
to long wavelength infrared, ∼300–10 000 nm).

Considerable research has examined thermal,7−12 photonic,13−15 and electrically16−19 induced adjustment to the optical
properties of cholesteric LCs. A significant fraction of these prior
research efforts has focused on electrically induced switching between
a transparent and scattering state, commonly referred to as a polymer-stabilized
cholesteric texture.5,6,20−26 These devices switch from an optically transparent state into a
scattering state by the application of an electric field, which orients
the LC into a focal conic texture.

Here, we focus on dynamic
reconfiguration of the reflection band
gap of polymer-stabilized cholesteric liquid crystals (PSCLCs). Recent
research has reported the ability to switch the reflection on or off,27 tune,28−31 or broaden3,19,32,33 the selective reflection of these
materials. Of relevance to the work detailed here, we have reported
on the ability to electromechanically distort a polymer stabilizing
network incorporated in the material system that directly affects
the pitch of the low-molar-mass cholesteric LC phase.32−34 Put succinctly, the polymer stabilizing network retains a structural
chirality derived from the preparation conditions. To date, these
effects have been consistently observable only in compositions prepared
with negative dielectric anisotropy (Δε < 0) nematic
LCs. Accordingly, upon the application of a dc field, the liquid crystalline
host does not initially reorient to the field direction enabling an
ion-mediated distortion of the structurally chiral polymer stabilizing
network to act and enforce pitch changes observable as bandwidth broadening,3,19,32,33 red-shifting tuning,28−30 blue-shifting tuning,31 and scatter.27

Here, we report
the refinement and optimization of the materials
chemistry to realize complete optical reconfiguration
of the reflection band gap of polymer-stabilized cholesteric LCs in
which the reflection notch can be tuned or broadened as well as switched
on and off. The switchability of this material system is enabled by
the use of conventional, positive dielectric anisotropy nematic LCs
(Δε > 0). In the applied dc field strengths examined
here,
the polymer stabilizing network is sufficiently strong to enforce
and retain the coupling of the alignment of the low-molar-mass LC
to the structural chirality of the polymer stabilizing network. Application
of a strong ac field can overcome the favorable interaction of the
LC and the polymer network, aligning the LC into the homeotropic orientation.
We demonstrate pixelated addressability in which four pixels can be
distinctly reconfigured to exhibit an optically clear region adjacent
to pixels that exhibit red, green, and blue reflections.

Results and Discussion
The material systems examined here is formulated with the chiral
dopants and chiral LC monomer (SL04151, AlphaMicron, Inc) illustrated
in Scheme 1. Samples
were prepared over a range of monomer concentrations based on either
a negative dielectric nematic LC host MLC-2079 (Merck) or a positive
dielectric nematic LC host E7 (Merck). Polymer stabilization was photoinitiated
by Irgacure 369 (BASF). Evident in Figure 1a, in a composition containing 6 wt % SL04151
employing the positive dielectric LC host E7, a large magnitude red
shift in the selective reflection of the cholesteric LC is observable
upon the application of a dc field. At the appropriate ac field strengths
necessary to overpower the alignment of the low-molar-mass LC to the
structurally chiral polymer network, the reflection can be removed
(Figure 1b). Complete
and repeatable switching was observed by the application of a 150
V (1 kHz) ac field with concurrent application of a dc bias, yielding
an optical element in which the reflection can be tuned and rapidly
switched on and off.

a PSCLC

switching of the PSCLC band gap is induced by the application of 150

(ii) 40, (iii) 60, and (iv) 70 V dc. Reflection switching of (i−iv)
was incuded with 150 V ac (1 kHz). See Movie 1 in the Supporting Information. The sample was formulated by mixing
0.4 wt % I-369, 6 wt % SL04151, 3 wt % R1011, and 90.6 wt % E7 and
prepared by exposing to 100 mW/cm2 365 nm wavelength UV
light for 3 min.

Dopants (R1011 and R811), and a Chiral LC Monomer (SL04151) Employed
in This Examination
Electro-optic control of the orientation of the LC molecules
is
the basis of modes widely used to regulate the transmission of light
through color filters to yield full color and high-resolution displays.
In Figure 2, a material
composition is formulated and prepared to exhibit blue-shifting tuning31 of the reflection. An alignment cell was constructed
with four pixels, locally addressable by a voltage source. The selective
reflection of the optical element is locally reconfigured from the
infrared (IR) (Figure 2a) to exhibit a single red pixel (Figure 2b), red and green pixels (Figure 2c), red, green, and blue pixels
(Figure 2d), and an
optically clear (homeotropic), red, green, and blue pixels (Figure 2e). As in Figure 1, the local control
of the reflection color is governed by the magnitude of the dc field
strength and the switchability is enabled by the overlay of a 150
V (1 kHz) ac field to induce a homeotropic orientation. Upon the removal
of the field, the local optical properties within a pixel restored
to the original selective reflection.

Figure 2 Control of color in PSCLC optical elements
separated into four
addressable pixels: (a) 0 V (IR), (b) 3 V dc was applied to the upper
right pixel (red), (c) 6 V dc was concurrently applied to the upper
left pixel (green), (d) 9 V dc was concurrently applied to the bottom
left pixel (blue), and (e) 250 V ac (1 kHz) was applied to the bottom
right pixel (homeotropic). The blue-shifting sample was formulated
by mixing 1.5 wt % I-369, 6 wt % SL04151, 5 wt % R1011, 5 wt % R811,
and 82.5 wt % E7 and prepared by exposing to 250 mW/cm2 UV light for 30 min.

Adjusting the preparation conditions (see Experimental
Section) to prepare the PSCLCs examined here and in our prior
reports distinguishes the electro-optical output. By reducing the
photoinitiator concentration and preparing with a 3 min exposure of
100 mW/cm2 UV light, the PSCLC optical element now allows
for electrical control of the bandwidth (Figure 3i–iv).3,19,32,33 Here, the application
of 20 V dc (1.33 V/μm) causes a sevenfold increase in the reflection
bandwidth. Once again, overlaying a 250 V (1 kHz) ac field allows
for switchability of the electrically induced broad reflection (Figure 3v). This device is
reticent to the use of electrochromic materials in autodimming mirrors
but switches faster with greater dexterity in color control.

Figure 3 Concurrent
switching and broadening of the selective reflection
of a PSCLC optical element. (i) 0 V dc, (ii) 5 V dc, (iii) 10 V dc,
(iv) 20 V dc, and (v) application of 250 V ac at 1 kHz switches the
alignment of the PSCLC to the homeotropic orientation from any of
the states (i–iv), removing the selective reflection. This
sample was formulated by mixing 1.5 wt % I-369, 6 wt % RM82, 3 wt
% R1011, and 89.5 wt % E7 and prepared by exposing to 150 mW/cm2 UV light for 3 min.

The three examples hereto are based on a polymer stabilizing
network
composed of 6 wt % monomer concentration, initiated with a 0.4–1.5
wt % photoinitiator, and subjected to various UV exposures (intensity
and duration). We conclude this study by illustrating the critical
role of monomer concentration in realizing the electro-optic reconfigurability
reported here. As evident in Figure 4, increasing the concentration of the chiral liquid
crystalline diacrylate monomer SLO4151 (Scheme 1) reduces the magnitude of the response and
eventually mutes any sensitivity of the material system to an applied
dc or ac field. Evident in the results in Figure 4, the strength of the polymer stabilizing
network strongly influences the sensitivity of the optical element
to the magnitude of the applied electric field. Also evident in Figure 4d, the formation
of robust, highly cross-linked polymer networks at large monomer concentrations
prevents an observable optical response.

Figure 4 Red shift in the selective
reflection of the PSCLC optical elements
with various polymer concentrations: (a) 6, (b) 8, (c) 10, and (d)
30 wt % over the range of dc voltages up to 300 V.

The electro-optic response of the samples discussed
hereto is summarized
and contrasted in Figure 5. Upon preparation, the PSCLCs exhibit uniform distribution
in the pitch across the sample thickness (previously measured via
confocal microscopy28) (Figure 5a). From the electro-optic
responses evident in Figures 1–4, the deformation of the polymer
network to an applied field is strongly dependent on the preparation
conditions of the samples, as detailed in a parallel report.31 It should be noted that in all cases detailed
here, the optical properties of the PSCLC return to the original selective
reflection upon removal of the applied electric field.

Figure 5 Summary of the results
presented here. (a) PSCLC samples are uniform
in pitch length across the 15 μm thickness. (b) For samples
that exhibit bandwidth broadening, the structural chirality of the
polymer stabilizing network is linearly deformed across the sample
thickness, yielding a continuous distribution in pitch length. The
pitch compresses near the negative electrode and expands near the
positive electrode. (c) For red-shifting tuning, the average pitch
length in the sample thickness is increased by the application of
a dc voltage. (d) When the materials chemistry has been adjusted via
long duration UV exposure, the materials exhibit blue-shifting tuning
where the average pitch length is shortened. (e) Regardless of the
nature of the structural chirality and the response to an applied
dc field, overlaying an ac field of sufficient strength can enforce
reorientation of the LC molecules into the homeotropic orientation
(pitch length goes to infinity) into an optically clear state. Removing
the ac field either restores the elements to the (a) 0 V state or
to the (b–d) specific optical output caused by the underlying
dc field.

In the results detailed in Figure 3, bandwidth broadening
is observable when the pitch
is distorted nonuniformly across the sample thickness. Evident in
the illustration and prior characterization via confocal microscopy,33 the local pitch is expanded near the positive
electrode, whereas the pitch near the negative electrode is compressed.
The structurally chiral polymer network in the case of the red- and
blue-shifting elements is distinguished. In samples that exhibit red
shift, as illustrated and confirmed in the confocal examination of
pitch,33 while the pitch is expanded near
the positive electrode and contracted near the negative electrode,
the pitch in the central 6–12 μm region of the sample
is increased uniformly. Conversely, adjusting the preparation conditions
such that the samples are prepared with extensive UV irradiation so
as to induce blue shifting tuning, the average pitch is reduced by
deformation, yielding a blue shift in the selective reflection.31

The sensitivity of the electro-optic response
to the preparation
conditions and photoinitiator concentration have been detailed in
a recent report.31 Summarized here, photopolymerization
of the diacrylate monomers reaches full conversion in less than a
minute of exposure. However, evident in this report and our prior
studies, extended UV irradiation differentiates the electro-optical
response when photopolymerization is initiated with aminoketone photoinitiators
such as Irgacure 369. We have hypothesized that this associated with
the postfunctionalization (reaction) of the residual initiator and
the polymer network. The morpholino group of Irgacure 369 is known
to be an efficient trap for cations, increasing the sensitivity of
the polymer network to ionic interaction. Further, heterogeneous distribution
of these fragments across the sample thickness could yield heterogeneous
deformation that could explain the nuanced electro-optic outputs we
have observed.

Conclusions
This report details
complete control of the spectral reflection
of cholesteric LCs, enabled by the optimization of material concentration
and preparation that allows for these devices to be based on positive
dielectric anisotropy LCs. Preparing these optical elements on this
type of LC allows for them to be reoriented to an applied ac field.
Accordingly, the optical elements have distinctive functional performance
wherein the presence, position, and breadth of the selective reflection
can be reconfigured. The dynamic control of the spectral content of
these materials can also be spatially manipulated. The material system
reported here extend and open up new application avenues for these
materials spanning aerospace, consumer goods, architecture, and sensing.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of PSCLCs
Alignment cells were prepared
from indium tin oxide-coated glass slides (Colorado Concepts). The
substrates were then cleansed in acetone and methanol and treated
with oxygen plasma. The substrates were subsequently coated with a
polyimide alignment layer. The alignment layers were rubbed with a
cloth, and the cell was constructed to ensure a planar alignment condition.
The cell gap was controlled by mixing 15 μm thick glass rod
spacers into an optical adhesive. Samples were prepared by mixing
0.4–1.5 wt % of the photoinitiator Irgacure 369 (BASF), two
right-handed chiral dopants (R1011 and R811, Merck), 6 wt % of an
achiral LC monomer (RM82, Merck) or a right-handed chiral LC monomer
(SL04151, AlphaMicron, Inc.), and a negative Δε (MLC-2079,
Δε = -6.1, Δn = 0.15, TNI = 102 °C at λ = 589 nm, Merck) or positive
Δε (E7/TNI = 58 °C, Δε
= 13.8, Δn = 0.2253 at λ = 589 nm, Merck)
nematic LC. The polymer stabilizing network was formed within the
samples by photoinitiated polymerization with 100–250 mW cm–2 of 365 nm light (Exfo) for 3–30 min. The photoinitiator
concentration and the duration of UV exposure is the primary differentiator
for the electro-optic responses reported here (red-shifting tuning,
blue-shifting tuning, and bandwidth broadening). More specifically,
for PSCLCs to exhibit bandwidth broadening, a small amount of I-369
(0.4 wt % or lower) is used to initiate polymerization, triggered
by comparatively lower intensity light (here, 100 mW/cm2 for 3 min). To induce red-shifting tuning, we formulated the PSCLCs
with 0.5–0.8 wt % I-369 and initiated polymerization with 100
mW/cm2 for 5 min. Finally, blue-shifting tuning was realized
in PSCLC samples prepared with 1–1.5 wt % I-369 and initiated
with comparatively high intensity exposure, 250 mW/cm2 for
30 min. To ensure homogeneous curing conditions, the cell was rotated
at an angular velocity of 2 Hz during polymerization. Although the
samples prepared with more traditional, one-sided curing exhibit electro-optic
responses similar to that reported here, the consistency and sample-to-sample
repeatability are improved by rotating the sample during curing. All
materials were used as received without any purification.

Experimental
Setup and Measurements
Transmission spectra
were collected with a fiber optic spectrometer. Unless otherwise mentioned,
the white light probe was right-handed circularly polarized. Transmission
spectra were collected before, during, and after the application of
dc fields with the scanning rate of 1 V s–1 or directly
applied to the target voltage.
