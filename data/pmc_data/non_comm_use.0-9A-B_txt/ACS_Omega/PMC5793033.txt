For years, the use of polyhistidine
tags (His-tags) has been a
staple in the isolation of recombinant proteins in immobilized metal
affinity chromatography experiments. Their usage has been widely beneficial
in increasing protein purity from crude cell lysates. For some recombinant
proteins, a consequence of His-tag addition is that it can affect
protein function and stability. Functional proteins are essential
in the elucidation of their biological, kinetic, structural, and thermodynamic
properties. In this study, we determine the effect of N-terminal His-tags
on the thermal stability of select proteins using differential scanning
fluorimetry and identify that the removal of the His-tag can have
both beneficial and deleterious effects on their stability.

Introduction
The production of recombinant
proteins is essential for biotechnology
and biomedical sciences. To be beneficial for research studies, these
proteins usually have to be expressed and purified in high quantities.
Once recombinant proteins are purified, they are normally stored or
used under conditions that are believed to be optimal for protein
stability. It is not surprising that many researchers working in the
fields of biotechnology and biomedicine direct a significant amount
of effort toward determining the most stable conditions for their
proteins of interest.

For purification purposes, many recombinant
proteins have their
DNA sequence modified to add specific residues to the N- or C-terminus
of the protein. These additional sequence fragments (or tags) convey
specific properties to the protein. For example, a tag introduced
for purification may contain a specific epitope recognized by an antibody
fragment immobilized on a chromatography column.1,2 Tags
that are commonly used include polyhistidine (His-tag), glutathione S-transferase, maltose-binding protein, and thioredoxin.
Furthermore, protein tags may be engineered to contain a specific
protease cleavage site, e.g., a site recognized by tobacco etch virus
(TEV) protease. Once the tag is cleaved, the protein is typically
left with just a few additional amino acids.3 Ideally, removing the tag should result in a protein that has the
activity or function similar to native protein.

His-tags (typically
containing six or more consecutive histidine
residues) may be used for protein purification by immobilized metal
affinity chromatography (IMAC), where divalent cations (usually Ni2+ or Co2+) are adhered to a solid matrix. IMAC
was introduced over four decades ago and has become one of the most
popular methods for recombinant protein purification.4 In some cases, the tags may not only ease protein purification
but also help in protein expression, folding, and/or solubility.5

His-tags, due to their relatively small
size (∼2.5 kDa),
are not believed to significantly interfere with the function and
structure of a majority of proteins.5,6 However, there
is an increase in the number of reports showing that this tacit assumption
may be false.7−10 A study by Mohanty et al. demonstrated the effects of varying the
length and position of His-tags on the expression and production of
a membrane protein.11 His-tags may affect
the oligomeric states of proteins as well as their function.8,9,12−15 Significant reductions in the
enzymatic activity of several different enzymes were observed upon
the incorporation of a His-tag.8,9,12 In the case of sperm whale myoglobin, the addition of an N-terminal
His-tag affected its conformational movements, which indicates that
the His-tag should be taken into account during the investigation
of protein structural dynamics.13 Moreover,
His-tags may also have an impact on structural studies and thus the
ability to crystallize proteins for X-ray diffraction studies.14,15

Over 90% of experimentally determined protein structures are
of
recombinant proteins,16 and a significant
fraction of these proteins are purified using His-tags. In many cases,
the His-tags do not interfere with the crystallization process and
can even be involved in the formation of crystal contacts.14 In contrast, the B-factor,
which describes the general displacement of atoms in a crystal structure,
shows that the presence of a His-tag increases this value compared
to structures determined without it, thus making crystallization more
difficult.14 This observation also suggests
that addition of a His-tag can alter protein dynamics and possibly
impact protein activity or function.

In this study, differential
scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used
to determine the effect of the N-terminal His-tag on protein stability.
DSF, also known as thermal-shift fluorescence-based screening or Thermofluor,
is a cost-effective and rapid screening method that may be used to
study protein stability or ligand-binding properties.17 In this method, samples of protein are mixed with different
solutions (containing, for example, ligands, buffer solutions, and
salt conditions) and a fluorescent hydrophobic dye. As the mixture
is gradually heated over time, the protein starts to denature and
inner hydrophobic residues are exposed; the fluorescent dye binds
to the exposed hydrophobic fragments, and the melting temperature
(Tm) of the protein can be determined
by monitoring fluorescence over time. Tm is the inflection point of the resulting fluorescence curve and
serves as a proxy for the stability of a protein sample. These experiments
are performed using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
instrument that is compatible with small volumes and capable of reaching
a broad temperature range.18 Such an approach
is a low-cost method to obtain high-throughput thermal scanning results
and has been proven to be very effective in the optimization of the
thermal stability of proteins.19−25 Additionally, DSF can also be used as a rapid screening method for
finding protein ligands and/or compounds that stabilize proteins.26−28

Several proteins with an N-terminal His-tag were studied here
to
monitor the impact of the tag on protein thermostability. Given the
widespread use of His-tags in recombinant protein production, understanding
the influence of His-tags on protein stability is central to biotechnology
and biochemical engineering. To address the lack of studies on the
effect of His-tags on protein stability, a diverse range of proteins
were selected that differ in molecular weight and quaternary structure
(Table 1). These proteins
were amenable for DSF studies because they did not significantly bind
the fluorescent probe, SYPRO orange, in the folded state, nor were
they precipitated by the probe. The proteins express well, are soluble,
have an N-terminal His-tag that can be cleaved by TEV protease, have
known biochemical functions, and many have their crystal structures
or homologous protein structures determined.

Results and Discussion
From this point forward, proteins with an attached His-tag will
be referred to as His-protein and proteins where the His-tag was cleaved
off by TEV protease will be referred to as the native protein name
with no prefix. As previously mentioned, the proteins discussed here
were produced in relatively large quantities and in all cases the
cleavage of the His-tag was possible with TEV protease. Originally,
our set of proteins also included Streptococcus pyogenes quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (SpNadC) as well as NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase (SpNadE); however, we
were not able to remove the His-tags from these proteins.29 Interestingly, although His-SpNadC and His-SpNadE
were crystallized and their structures were determined, we were not
able to crystallize SpNadD or His-SpNadD.29

Examples of typical DSF results are shown in Figure 1, and the results for proteins
not shown
in Figure 1 can be
found in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The Tm of each protein is shown with
a color gradient, where red, white, and green show low, average, and
high melting temperatures, respectively. The color gradient is relative
to each protein individually. For example, Figure 1A shows the melting temperatures for His-β-lactamase
and β-lactamase. Both were found to be most stable at pH 6.0,
1.0 M salt, with β-lactamase being more stable by ∼2
°C than His-β-lactamase.

Effect of pH and His-Tag on Protein Stability
Figure 2 shows DSF
results
for all proteins in the presence of sodium chloride along with varied
pH, whereas Table 2 summarizes the highest melting temperatures and best buffering conditions
for proteins studied. β-Lactamase was most stable in the pH
range 6.0–7.0 and without the His-tag. SpNadD was most stable
in the pH range 8.5–9.5, and the His-tag did not affect stability
based on pH. VvDxr was most stable in the pH range 5.5–6.5
with His-VvDxr being slightly more stable under these conditions than
VvDxr. McsA was most stable in the pH range 6.0–7.0 and the
His-tag did not significantly impact stability. MtDapB was most stable
in the pH range 8.5–9.5, and His-MtDapB was less stable in
this same range by ∼4 °C. Furthermore, His-MtDapB was
very unstable in the pH range 5.0–6.0, whereas MtDapB showed
much higher stability (∼20 °C). NgDapB was the most stable
in the pH range 8.0–9.0, and the His-tag did not impact stability
except at lower pH values (5.0–6.0), where His-NgDapB was less
stable. Amb a 8 was most stable in the pH range 8.5–9.5, and
the His-tag slightly increased its stability. Art v 4 was most stable
in the pH range 8.0–9.5, and the His-tag did not significantly
impact stability. Bet v 2 was most stable in the pH range 8.5–9.5,
and the His-tag increased its stability by ∼4 °C.

a Numbers in parentheses indicate
values after His-tag cleavage by TEV protease. The pH values are given
in ranges. Best NaCl stability for pH indicates the salt concentration
that gave the highest thermal stability for the best pH range; no
significant impact means that protein stability was not affected by
salt concentration.

Analysis
of Table 2 shows that
the biggest shift in the value of the calculated pI (decrease
by 0.6) is observed for profilins, which is expected as these proteins
are the smallest among those studied here, and the His-tag corresponds
to a significant fraction of the polypeptide chain (Table 1). The results presented in Table 2 also show that for
most of the studied proteins (SpNadD, MtDapB, NgDapB, VvDapB, Amb
a 8, Arv v 4, and Bet v 2) the regions of the best stability correspond
to solutions with pH values significantly higher than the calculated
pI value. At the same time, these proteins are least stable in solutions
that have pH values close to or lower than the calculated pI. In the
case of β-lactamase, the lowest melting temperatures are observed
in solutions with pH close to or slightly lower than the calculated
pI. In addition, β-lactamase is most stable in solutions with
pH values significantly lower than pI values, but not under very acidic
conditions. VvDxr and mcsA behave in a completely different manner
as the pH values for solutions in which they display their best thermal
stability overlap with calculated pIs.

Effect of Salt Concentration
and His-Tag on Protein Stability
Results comparing protein
stability with no salt and 1.0 M salt
are shown in Figure 3. Each salt condition shown is respective to the pH in which a protein
was most stable (Figure 2). His-tag lowered the stabilities of β-lactamase and MtDapB
for both no salt and 1.0 M salt; had little or no effect on the stabilities
of SpNadD, mcsA, NgDapB, VvDapB, and Art v 4 for both no salt and
1.0 M salt; and increased the stabilities of VvDxr, Amb a 8, and Bet
v 2 in the presence of no salt only. His-β-lactamase Tm increased by ∼5 °C, His-SpNadD
by ∼5 °C, His-VvDxr by ∼5 °C, His-mcsA by
∼2 °C, His-MtDapB by ∼8 °C, and His-VvDapB
by ∼6 °C in the presence of 1.0 M salt compared to no
salt. On the other hand, Tm for β-lactamase
increased by ∼4 °C, SpNadD by ∼6 °C, VvDxr
by ∼7 °C, mcsA by ∼2 °C, MtDapB by ∼6
°C, and VvDapB by ∼8 °C, exhibiting a slight change
in the trend as compared to the His-tagged proteins under the same
conditions. Overall, increasing salt concentration increased the stability
of most proteins except NgDapB, Art v 4, Amb a 8, and Bet v 2; NgDapB
and Art v 4 were not affected by salt concentration, whereas Amb a
8 and Bet v 2 were destabilized by increasing salt concentration.

Figure 3 Effect
of salt concentration and His-tag on protein stability.
Melting temperatures are shown for solutions containing no salt and
1.0 M salt. The pH of each solution was the pH that displayed the
best thermal stability for each respective protein.

Quaternary Structure and Protein Stability
The most
stable proteins (MtDapB, NgDapB, and VvDapB) form tetrameric assemblies,
whereas the least stable proteins are monomeric (β-lactamase,
Amb a 8, Art v 4, Bet v 2). Dimeric proteins (VvDxr and mcsA) show
intermediate stability. However, the trimeric SpNadD also displays
low temperature stability. Taking into account the limited number
of proteins studied, as well as the small variety of the oligomeric
structures represented, it is not possible to establish any meaningful
trend correlating the thermal stability with the quaternary structure.

Homologous Proteins
Among the ten proteins studied
here, six of them belong to two protein families: the profilins and
DapB proteins. Amb a 8, Art v 4, and Bet v 2 have over 75% of identical
residues. DapB proteins are less similar in terms of the sequence
with 53% of sequence identity between VvDapB and NgDapB and approximately
30% of sequence identity between MtDapB and both NgDapB and VvDapB.
Despite the differences in amino acid composition, proteins in both
groups have similar calculated pIs and surprisingly very similar stabilities.
Although the similarities in the highest Tm values are not so pronounced, these proteins have very similar profiles
of stability when pH of the solution is taken into consideration (Figures 2, 3, and Table 2).

The varied pH and NaCl concentration results showed that
the profilins (Amb a 8, Art v 4, and Bet v 2) were found to be least
stable with an average Tm around 50–54
°C (Figures 1 and S1). They all are unstable under conditions with
pH below 5.5. NgDapB, MtDapB, and VvDapB were found to have the highest
stability with Tm above 70 °C under
the same conditions (Figures 1 and S1). Although NgDapB displays
similar thermal stability at all NaCl concentrations, MtDapB and VvDapB
are more stable at higher NaCl concentrations. These experiments indicate
that pH of the solution has a more significant impact on protein thermal
stability than salt concentration. All proteins analyzed here were
stable over a relatively wide range of pH. However, decreased stability
in acidic solutions (≤pH 5.0) was seen for most of the proteins,
which may be due to the fact that most of the proteins studied here
have a calculated isoelectric point around 5–6 (Table 2). These proteins showed an
overall trend of being more stable in higher salt concentrations with
the exception of Amb a 8, which was slightly destabilized as salt
concentration increased.

Limitations of DSF
It was observed
that DSF, as the
method, has a limited application for proteins that bind to large
hydrophobic ligands (like SYPRO orange), have high disulfide bond
content, and/or have high thermal stability.15 For example, we were not able to determine thermal stability of
Ara h 8 (PR-10-related peanut allergen with a large ligand(s) binding
cavity),30 Cor a 8 (nonspecific lipid-transfer
protein and hazelnut allergen),31 Act d
5 (kiwi fruit allergen with unknown function),32 and ragweed allergens Amb a 9 and Amb a 10 (calcium-binding
proteins) using DSF. Information on the stability (and thermostability)
of the allergens may be especially useful in the case of the food
allergens as these proteins very often undergo thermal processing.

Our results on the thermal stabilities of Amb a 8, Art v 4, and
Bet v 2 (inhaled allergens originating from pollens) clearly show
that indeed these proteins are relatively unstable.33 The presence of the His-tag has no significant impact on
the thermal stabilities of Amb a 8 and Art v 4, but it slightly increases
the stability of Bet v 2. This observation is consistent with the
high sequence identity between Amb a 8 and Art v 4 (∼89%) and
lower sequence identity between Bet v 2 and the two other profilins
(∼76%). Nonetheless, all these allergens have very similar
thermal stability, and it is somewhat surprising that the addition
of a relatively large purification tag to a small protein does not
have a more pronounced effect.

Furthermore, it should be noted
that our studies were performed
with a purification tag that is 25 amino acids, where 4 linker residues
(SGSG) are retained after tag removal. The length of the tag and linker,
the amino acid composition, and their sequence order can have potential
implications on the protein’s thermal stability. However, in
the scope of the experiments performed here, different tag characteristics
and their impact on protein thermal stability were not investigated.

In Most Cases, the Presence of His-Tag Decreased Thermal Stability
Out of the ten proteins evaluated in this study, protein thermal
stability results for four (Amb a 8, Art v 4, mcsA, and SpNadD) were
not significantly affected by cleavage of the His-tag. For the remaining
six proteins, a change in stability was observed that was related
to the presence or absence of the His-tag. His-Bet v 2 was the only
protein observed to be more stable than its native counterpart, Bet
v 2, in the majority of pH and salt concentrations tested (Figures 2 and 3). In the case of MtDapB, the cleavage of the His-tag resulted
in a more tolerable pH range; both constructs are stable in pH 6.0,
although MtDapB is significantly more stable at pH 5.0 than His-MtDapB
(about a 24 °C Tm difference). A
similar result is seen for VvDapB at pH 5.5 in which the Tm difference is at least 8 °C (Figure 3). An increase in thermal stability at lower
pH is also observed for NgDapB. His-β-lactamase and His-VvDxr
are more stable at lower pH and less stable at higher pH than β-lactamase
and VvDxr, respectively. However, this effect is significantly more
pronounced for β-lactamase. Bet v 2 was the only recombinant
protein that had increased stability with a His-tag. This protein
was more stable when the His-tag was intact, which may be indicative
of high entropy residues at the N-terminus of the protein. It was
also demonstrated that the presence of poly-l-proline peptides
or urea may affect the thermal stability of profilin proteins.33 Binding of the proline-rich peptides may be
affected by the presence of additional residues at the N-terminus
of profilin as this part of the protein participates in the peptide
binding.

The most significant changes in thermal stability were
observed for β-lactamase and MtDapB. Various changes in the
overall trend were seen between the native and His-tag versions of
the proteins. In the case of β-lactamase, removal of His-tag
resulted in a two-way change. First, the pH range in which the protein
is stable significantly shifted toward more basic conditions. Second,
notable changes were recorded in Tm in
accordance with this shift. For instance, the protein Tm increased under conditions of pH 7.0–9.5 by an
average of 3 °C, whereas an average decrease of 7 °C was
seen under low-pH (4.0–6.0) conditions. In the case of MtDapB,
His-tag removal caused the protein to be stable over a wider pH range,
specifically under conditions of pH 5.0 and 5.5; the Tm increased from 30 and 31 to 59 and 54 °C, respectively.

Most of the proteins mentioned herein have had their crystal structures
determined (Figure 4). For all of the proteins, the His-tag is solvent-exposed and thus
susceptible to TEV protease cleavage. Despite this fact, removal of
the His-tag most often resulted in increased thermal stability. Although
changes observed in Tm were not drastic
between His-tagged and native proteins, it is apparent that the presence
of a His-tag can contribute to the thermal instability of the protein
and that its removal may prove beneficial when designing in vitro
experiments and optimal conditions for storage and/or structural biology.34

Information on protein thermal stability is not only important
for designing experiments related to functional and characterization
studies of protein, but it may be also used during protein purification.35 For example, in a case of a protein with high
thermal stability, one may include a step involving heating of a sample
to remove less thermally stable impurities. These impurities, like
native proteins from E. coli, are quite
often co-purified with IMAC.36,37 The same procedure
could also be done while varying the pH and salt concentration to
improve isolation. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that DSF
and information on thermal stability of proteins may be used to guide
the development of protocols for protein refolding.38

Thermal stability testing could also be used for
the determination
of optimal conditions for techniques that require minimal buffer conditions
to lessen background noise from experimental results. For example,
isothermal titration calorimetry tends to provide more accurate results
when buffer/salt concentrations are at their lowest.39 DSF thermal stability testing can be utilized to give an
indication of how long a protein will remain stable at a particular
temperature within minimally buffered solutions. In summary, the use
of affinity tags, like the polyhistidine tag, provides a highly effective
means for isolating various proteins. However, it is important to
consider the possibility that the introduction of even a relatively
small purification tag may alter the behavior of a protein of interest.

Experimental Procedures
Cloning
Genes encoding all proteins
in this study were
synthesized by ATUM, Inc. (Newark CA) (http://www.atum.bio/), codon-optimized for expression in E. coli, and inserted into the plasmid pJExpress411.
This plasmid contains an inducible T7 promoter with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and kanamycin resistance. Each
plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) by heat shock.40 Upon transformation,
correct gene sequences were verified by DNA sequencing from Eton Bioscience
(Research Triangle Park, NC) using T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers.
All proteins used in this study were designed to contain an N-terminal
purification tag (MHHHHHHSSGVDLGTENLYFQ↓SGSG). The purification
tag includes a TEV-cleavage site (cut site marked with an arrow),
and its sequence was designed based on the His-tag coded by vector
pMCSG7.41

Protein Expression and
Purification
For expression
and purification, E. coli cells were
grown to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C, induced
with IPTG at a working concentration of 0.4–1.0 mM, and shaken
at 16 °C overnight. Cell cultures were centrifuged, and cell
pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500
mM sodium chloride, 10 mM imidazole, 2% glycerol, and 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol
(β-ME)) supplemented with Pierce protease inhibitors following
the manufacturer’s protocol and lysed by sonication; NgDapB
and β-lactamase were resuspended in lysis buffer with no β-ME
and no glycerol. A pH of 6.5 was used for β-lactamase (this
applies to all of the buffers for NgDapB and β-lactamase purification
mentioned herein). The homogenate was then centrifuged, and the supernatant
was separated from the insoluble cellular debris. The crude extract
was loaded onto Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen or Pierce) IMAC
resin previously equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 2% glycerol, and 20 mM β-ME).
After washing, proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 2% glycerol, and 20 mM β-ME).
The fractions containing protein were then pooled and dialyzed in
10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5.0 mM β-ME using SnakeSkin
dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher, Grand Island, NY) with 3 or 10 kDa
molecular weight cutoff dependent on protein size.

His-tag cleavage
was achieved by supplementing purified protein (1–2 mg/mL)
with TEV protease in a 1:100 (w/w) protease-to-protein ratio and then
dialyzing overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with TEV protease,
the solution was passed through a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in dialysis
buffer to collect non-tagged protein and concentrated using Amicon
centrifugal filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) with 3 or 10 kDa
molecular weight cutoff dependent on protein size. Protein concentration
was determined by the Bradford method.42 After concentration, all protein samples were further purified using
a Superdex 200 PG gel filtration column (equilibrated in dialysis
buffer) attached to an ÄKTA Pure liquid chromatography system
(GE Healthcare). Protein purity was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and all were isolated with an average purity
of 90% or better. All proteins selected for this study were expressed
with yields ranging from 5 to 40 mg/L of E. coli culture

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
Using a MASTERBLOCK
96 deep well plate (Greiner; Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), solutions
were prepared as an in-house pH and salinity screen. All conditions
contained working concentrations of 50 mM buffer with a pH range 4–9.5
(in 0.5 unit increments) and a salt range (sodium chloride) 0–1.0
M (no salt, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 M); although
a salt gradient was used, residual salt from purification buffers
was present in all protein samples, which slightly alters the working
concentration of salt under each condition. Buffers used to accommodate
the pH ranges were acetate (pH 4.0–5.0), bis-Tris (pH 5.5–6.5),
Tris (pH 7.0–8.0), and N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid (pH 8.5–9.5). SYPRO orange dye (ThermoFisher, Waltham,
MA) was diluted 1:1000 in 1.0 mL of 1–2 mg/mL protein. This
solution was mixed under each screen condition 1:1 for a 20 μL
of total reaction volume in a Bio-Rad Hardshell 96-well RT-PCR plate
(Hercules, CA). The plates were sealed using Microseal PCR plate sealing
film (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and stability was measured in a Bio-Rad
CFX96 RT-PCR instrument. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
An experimental protocol was created to increase the temperature of
the 96-well plate from 30 to 90 °C in 2 °C increments after
1.0 min intervals. Upon conclusion of the experiment, Bio-Rad CFX
Manager software was used to determine the inflection point of melting
curves (Tm).
