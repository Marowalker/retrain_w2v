One key challenge hindering the valorization
of lignin is its structural
complexity. Artificial lignin-like materials provide a stepping stone
between the simplicity of model compounds and the complexity of lignin.
Here, we report an optimized synthesis of an all-G β-O-4 polymer 1 designed to model softwood lignin. After acetylation, the
polymer Ac-1(V) was fractionated using a protocol that
involved only volatile organic solvents, which left no insoluble residue.
Using diffusion ordered spectroscopy NMR in combination with gel permeation
chromatography, it was revealed that this fractionated material behaved
like a flexible linear polymer in solution (average α > 0.5).
Acetylated kraft lignin was subsequently processed using the same
fractionation protocol. By comparison with the model polymer, we propose
that the acetylated kraft lignin is composed of two classes of materials
that exhibit contrasting physical properties. One is comparable to
the acetylated all-G β-O-4 polymer Ac-1, and the
second has a significantly different macromolecular structure.

Introduction
The biorefinery concept
requires that value is derived from all
of the components that make up biomass as this should ensure economic
viability.1 For lignocellulosic biomass,
this means that lignin, as well as the cellulose and hemicellulose
fractions, must be made full use of. Numerous groups worldwide study
the use of lignin either as a starting point for novel material development
or as a source of renewable low-molecular-weight chemical feedstocks
or new platform chemicals.2−7 One key challenge is the complexity of lignin and the impact it
has on both its chemical reactivity and analysis. For example, depolymerization
of lignin by targeting the β-O-4 linkages requires two contiguous
linkages of this type for monomer unit production (excluding end groups).
This limits the maximum yield of monomers derived exclusively from
a β-O-4 unit to around 14–36 wt % depending on the source
of lignin.8,9 To realize the full potential of lignin,
we must continue to improve our understanding of its structure.

The biggest obstacle for lignin characterization is likely its
heterogeneity and polydisperse nature.10 Although heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR studies
of lignin have proved to be very useful for identifying various structural
features and functional groups, using this method in a quantitative
manner is questionable.11 A crude lignin
sample can be composed of molecules with a large span of molecular
weights (MWs) that will impact on the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the
NMR resonances. Although the effect of T1 relaxation can be mitigated by using relaxation agents and long
interscan delays, the effect of T2 relaxation
on the insensitive nuclei enhancement by polarization transfer (INEPT),
that is utilized by HSQC correlations, is unavoidable.12

One way to simplify this inherent challenge
is to “purify”
the lignin in such a way that a series of fractions are formed that
cover different molecular weight windows. This is referred to as fractionation, and a wide range of different methodologies
have been developed.13−19 The standard protocol for determining the MW of fractions is currently
gel permeation chromatography (GPC), but there are fundamental limitations
to this method.20,21 For instance, structural features
cannot be differentiated from each other using this analysis. In addition,
calibration is typically done using polystyrene standards that do
not effectively mimic the structure of lignin.20

Here, inspired by previous publications, we report
our studies
on the use of the 1H-pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR technique
[diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY)] that could provide significant
advantages when analyzing lignin fractions.22−24 Our initial
studies use a polymeric lignin model (an all-G β-O-4 polymer 1, Scheme 1B) that we have prepared. After acetylation, model polymer 1 was fractionated using a new organic solvent-based approach
and each fraction was analyzed using GPC, 1H NMR end-group
analysis, and DOSY NMR methods. The results obtained using the three
techniques correlated well and encouraged us to repeat the process
using a commercial kraft lignin. The analysis shows that acetylated
kraft lignin can be viewed as being made up of two different sets
of fractions: one set that shows properties similar to those of our
acetylated all-G β-O-4 model polymer 1 and a second
set that is clearly very different from this model polymer. These
findings are supported by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis
of the crude kraft lignin and its acetylated fractions. Furthermore,
effects of MW of lignin fractions on NMR relaxation times and intensity
of resonances in HSQC correlation experiments will be discussed.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
of model lignin polymers is an advanced area with
methods ranging from the preparation of dehydrogenase polymers using
biomimetic approaches25 to the controlled
preparation using chemical methods of less8,26,27 or more28 advanced
lignin polymers. We have reported a robust route to a 1:1 S:G β-O-4
polymer 2 which was used to aid the development of a
novel lignin depolymerization protocol (Scheme 1A).8,28 Our polymer 2 modelled a hardwood lignin, and few synthetic challenges were
encountered during its synthesis. However, given the commercial availability
of softwoods and their frequent use in industrial pulping and biorefining,
it was decided to prepare an all-G β-O-4 model polymer 1 for use in this study (Scheme 1B). Use of a synthesis protocol analogous
to that developed for 2 yielded limited amounts
of 1, so we started by optimizing the model polymer synthesis.
A more detailed experimental section can be found in the Supporting Information.

Optimization of the Synthesis
of All-G β-O-4 Polymer 1
In brief, the
approach used to prepare 1 started with the commercially
available bromo-ester 3(II) (R = Et, Scheme 1B). Alkylation of the phenolic
oxygen in vanillin with 3(II) gave monomer 4(II) in nearly quantitative yield. Subsequent
reaction of 4(II) with LDA led to the formation of the
polyether 5(II), which was carried through crude,
and the aldehyde and carboxylic ester groups were reduced using sodium
borohydride. Workup involved the precipitation of polymer 1(II) from water using a 6 M hydrochloric acid solution. A low yield of 1(II) was obtained using these conditions (10%, half of that
previously reported for the synthesis of 2(8,28)). One possible explanation for this difference was that during the
polymerization reaction, 5(II) was poorly soluble in
the organic reaction solvent [tetrahydrofuran (THF)], leading to the
precipitation of low-molecular-weight chains early in the reaction.
The lower MW polyether chains in 5(II), when reduced
to give polymer 1(II), would also be expected to be soluble
in the acidic aqueous workup solution and hence did not precipitate.
It seems likely that these two factors combine to reduce the yield.
As large quantities of polymer 1 were needed, optimization
was required.

The only position that can be varied is the structure
of the ester group in 4 (Scheme 1B). A range of bromo-esters 3(I–VIII) was used to prepare different polymerization monomers 4(I) and 4(III)–4(VIII). The methyl and tBu derivatives of 3 were commercially
available whilst the higher alkane-containing bromoesters were synthesized
from bromoacetic acid 6 and the respective alkyl alcohol
using Dean–Stark apparatus (quantitative yields). For consistency,
all polymerizations of 4(I–VIII) were performed
on a 2 g scale in 40 mL of THF with 2 h of stirring after the addition
of the freshly prepared LDA. In general, it was observed that polymer 5 precipitated less rapidly with increasing chain length of
the alkyl R group in 4. Consistent with this, the average
length of the polymer chain in 5 (referred to as the
DP) increased as R increased in size up to the point when R = octyl
(Table 1 and Figure S1). The decyl (4(VI)) and
dodecyl (4(VII)) derivatives gave polymers 5(VI) and 5(VII), respectively, with smaller DPs compared
to that of the octyl derivative 5(V). Precipitation of
the polymer with a methyl side chain 5(I) occurred very
quickly, consistent with its low DP (Table 1). Branched poly(ester) 5(VIII) gave the worst DP (2.2 units), so other branched esters were not
studied. Reduction of polymers 5(I–VIII) gave
isolated yields of the final polymer 1 ranging from 4
to 33% (Table 1). A
correlation between the DP of 5 and the isolated yield
of 1 was observed, with model polymer 1(V) derived from polymer 5(V) (DP = 6.2) being obtained
in the highest yield (33%) and model polymer 1(VIII) derived
from polymer 5(VIII) (DP = 2.2) being formed in the lowest
yield (4%).

mass of 1 after purification by precipitation into diethyl
ether.
Number average (Mn) and weight average
(Mw) MWs were assessed by GPC (g mol–1). Molar mass dispersity (D̵M) values were calculated by taking the ratio of the average
MWs measured by GPC (Mw/Mn).

to the mass of 1 isolated after being precipitated from
an acetone/methanol
(9:1) solution into 10 volumes of diethyl ether compared to the theoretical
maximum amount.

The MWs
(Mn and Mw) of polymer models 1(I–VIII) were assessed
by GPC. The weight average MW (Mw) of 1 varied from 1700 to 8700 g mol–1 whilst
the number average MW (Mn) of 1 varied from 1000 to 2200 g mol–1. Mn and Mw were at their highest
for polymer models 1(V) and 1(VI). The polymer
model 1(VIII) derived from the polymer with the branched t-Bu side chain 5(VIII) gave the lowest average
MWs in the series (Table 1, entry VIII). The polydispersity of the isolated
polymer models 1 increased from 1.8 for 1(I) to 3.9 for 1(VI). Values for the polydispersity of
lignin are between 1.4 and 8.529 depending
on the species of wood, suggesting that any of the polymer models
prepared here could be used to mimic typical lignin MW distributions.
Given the yield of production of the polymer model 1(V) from the polymer with an octyl side chain 5(V) (33%)
and the relatively high MW and polydispersity of 1(V), it was decided to scale-up its synthesis, leading to the preparation
of a total of 34.5 g in three batches of 1(V). GPC analysis
showed that a reduction in the MW and polydispersity of the resulting
polymer 1(V) occurred compared to the small-scale reaction
(Table S1; for HSQC assignment, see Figure S2).

Fractionation and Analysis
of Softwood All-G β-O-4 Polymer
Model 1(V)
Fractionation of Acetylated Model Polymer Ac-1(V)
Having prepared a sufficient amount of polymer 1(V), the next stage was to identify a fractionation method.
Whilst a
range of protocols for lignin fractionation have been reported,13−19 we developed an alternative approach that relied on the use of a
varying ratio of two volatile organic solvents. This choice was made
to enable a controllable increase in the polarity (“dissolving
ability”) of the solvent mixture and for the practical reason
that it would decrease the amount of time required to recover the
lignin fractions through the removal of the volatile solvents in each
step of the process (approximately 10 min per sample was required).
A previously reported protocol involved using acetone and hexane as
the solvent and the antisolvent, respectively.30 However, this fractionation selectively precipitated lignin
fractions using different ratios of the solvents and was reported
to leave a considerable amount of lignin unfractionated. Here, we
report the selective dissolution of lignin-like polymers using a similar
solvent/antisolvent system. Unfortunately, our model polymer 1(V) was only partially soluble in the types of solvents we
wanted to use, and the solubility was expected to be worse when real
lignin samples were used. Because acetylation of lignin has been reported
to enhance its solubility,31 we decided
to acetylate polymer 1(V) using pyridine and acetic anhydride
to give the acetylated polymer Ac-1(V). Subsequent fractionation
of Ac-1(V) was then performed by stirring the acetylated
polymer in 10 volumes (v/v) of an acetone–diethyl ether solvent
system. The initial concentration of acetone was 5% (v/v), and at
each step of the fractionation, this was incremented by 5% until all
of the polymer had dissolved (Figure S3). This also highlights a further advantage of fractionating acetylated
polymers/lignin because all of the material was dissolved, leaving
no insoluble residue. To the best of our knowledge, other reported
fractionation procedures do not achieve this using only volatile organic
solvents in a solvent/antisolvent system. Two fractionations were
initially carried out on polymer Ac-1(V) to assess reproducibility
(G-1 and G-2, Figure 1 and Table S1). Fraction yield analysis
was then performed to determine the mass distribution across the fractions.
In total, seven fractions were obtained for both G-1 and G-2 fractionations,
with a near Gaussian distribution being observed for the isolated
yields (blue and red series, Figure 1; and Table S2). The total
yield of the fractionation process was 88% for G-1 and 95% for G-2
(theoretical yield, assuming 98% of material recovered at each step
is 87% 0.987). The slight difference in
fraction yield profiles between runs may result from the contrasting
overall yields (Table S2).

of Ac-1(V) performed
in triplicate. The bars correspond to the first (G-1, blue) and second
(G-2, red) fractionation runs. Yields are shown as percentages of
the total recovered material.

Ac-1(V) Fraction GPC Analysis
Average
MWs (Mw and Mn) of the Ac-1(V) fractions were obtained by GPC using
polystyrene standards sourced from Polymer Standards Service (PSS)
to generate a calibration curve.20,32 The overlay
of the chromatograms of the fractions from fractionation G-1 showed
that the initial bulk material had been fractionated into seven bands
of different average MWs (Figure 2). This was consistent across both fractionations (G1
and G2). To assess experimental error, this GPC analysis was performed
in triplicate. The statistical analysis revealed that the maximum
observed standard deviation (σ) for each fraction was within
1.6% of the mean value (Table S3, fraction
F7). With the reproducibility of the analysis confirmed, subsequent
analyses were not performed in triplicate.

Figure 2 Overlay of GPC chromatograms
of fractions derived from the first
fractionation G-1 series. The analysis of these fractions was carried
out in triplicate (G-1(1), Table S3). Arbitrary
scaling was used in the vertical dimension to match the heights of
all peaks. Overlay of chromatograms with scaling derived from isolated
yields of particular fractions is shown in Figure S4.

The corresponding G-1 Mw average values
(Table S4) steadily increased from 2400
g mol–1 (G-1 F1) to 5900 g mol–1 (G-1 F7). The Mn values were found to
be lower ranging from 1800 g mol–1 (G-1 F1) to 3700
g mol–1 (G-1 F7). The G-2 fractionation showed a
similar trend [from 1800 to 5000 g mol–1 (Mw) and from 1400 to 3000 g mol–1 (Mn) (Table S4)].

The polydispersity (D̵M) across
all fractionations was also calculated and gave a low value of 1.3
for early fractions (F1–F4, Table S4). From fraction F5 onward, however, D̵M of each fraction increased (see Table S4 and the Supporting Information for a more detailed discussion). Because of the uncertainties in
the GPC Mn determination and the simplicity
of the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of Ac-1(V), quantitative
NMR end-group analysis was used to obtain an alternative value of Mn for comparison.

Quantitative 1H NMR Analysis of Fractions of Ac-1(V)
For
polymers with relatively low MWs, end-group
analysis by 1H NMR offers a reliable alternative for measuring Mn.33 Because all
fractions derived from model polymer Ac-1(V) have end
groups detectable by 1H NMR, this method was used to compare Mn values with those obtained by GPC. Quantitative 1H NMR spectra of all of the fractions derived from polymer Ac-1(V) were acquired. The average chain length (and the respective Mn) for each fraction was then calculated (see Figure S5 and Table S5 for details). The end-group analysis of the G-1 fractionation series
showed that the Mn values increased from
1700 (F1) to 4300 (F7) g mol–1 (Table S6), with a significant difference between the two techniques
being observed for the heavier fractions (Table S6). By substituting the Mn(NMR)
value in place of the Mn(GPC) value, more
consistent polydispersity values were calculated (Table S7, D̵M = 1.3 ±
0.1 for all fractions F1–F7). An analogous picture was seen
for the G-2 fractionation (Table S8). Although
this use of Mw and Mn values from different techniques is not suitable to accurately
assess D̵M, we believe that this
comparison highlights a possible source of error coming from GPC.
Despite these small discrepancies in Mn values, quantitative 1H NMR analysis has provided additional
evidence for a successful fractionation.

Diffusion 1H-PFG
NMR Analysis of Fractions of Ac-1(V)
PFG NMR
spectroscopy can be used to measure
the translational diffusion of molecules. The diffusion coefficient
(D) can be linked with resonances in the NMR spectrum
and the corresponding structural features in the analyzed molecules.
For polymers, the Mark–Houwink equation (eq 1) based on the Flory scaling relationship
can be used to establish the relationship between D and MW.34,35 1  

In eq 1, K and α are the so-called
scaling parameters that depend on the macromolecular polymer structure
as well as the experimental conditions, namely, solvent viscosity
and temperature. The scaling parameters K and α
can be obtained by analyzing a series of monodisperse polymer standards
under a given set of experimental conditions and fitting the logarithmic
form of the Mark–Houwink equation (eq 2) into the experimental data. 2  

It should be
noted that high viscosity and molecular crowding can
also hinder the diffusion. Therefore, sample concentration and temperature
must be controlled across a series of diffusion measurements. If concentration
control is not feasible, a correction factor derived from the concentration
dependence can be used.36−38

To the best of our knowledge,
only a few examples of the application
of the Mark–Houwink equation to lignin can be found in the
literature.22,23 Garver et al.23 have studied the scaling of diffusion coefficients with
the MW for unacetylated lignin fractions in 1 M NaOH and acetylated
lignin in CDCl3. The fractions for this study were obtained
by preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with 0.1 M NaOH
as the mobile phase. The values of molecular scaling exponent α,
0.39 and 0.30, are found to be consistent with a very compact and
branched structure of the particular lignin under study.23

Kraft lignin fractions obtained by preparative
SEC and characterized
by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry have been used to establish a Mark–Houwink calibration
curve.22 We decided to explore whether
the fractions of model polymer Ac-1(V) could conform
to the same relationship and whether our solvent fractionation method
could be used to determine the calibration curve that is essential
for the application of DOSY NMR to lignin analysis.

The average
values of the diffusion coefficient D obtained for
each of the fractions derived from Ac-1(V) in fractionation
G-1 showed a strong linear correlation with both
the Mw (blue line, Figure 3) and Mn (orange
line) values resulted from the GPC analysis, with correlation coefficients R2 = 0.994 and 0.993, respectively (Figure 3 and Table S10). Both calibration curves also yielded
similar scaling parameters (α = 0.69 and 0.89 and log K = −7.90 and −7.32). The difference in the
scaling factor α that was calculated using either the Mn(GPC) or the Mw(GPC) values was expected as D̵M of the fractions was higher than 1. The Mn data from the 1H NMR end-group analysis (gray line) was
also evaluated. The resulting scaling factors (α = 0.67 and
log K = −8.04) were found to be comparable
with those obtained using average MWs measured by GPC. To assess the
error associated with fitting this data to the Mark–Houwink
equation, the analysis was repeated for the G-2 fractionation data
(Table S10 and Figure S7). Scaling factors α and log K for
the two fractionations (G-1 and G-2) are summarized in Table 2 for comparison. For low-molecular-mass
unbranched polymers such as Ac-1(V), we assume that Mn derived from end-group analysis is the most
reliable which is confirmed by the good reproducibility of the Mark–Houwink
parameters (α = 0.66 ± 0.01 and log K =
−8.04). We propose that these values could be used as empirical
Mark–Houwink parameters for a quick DOSY NMR assessment of
MW of light fractions of unbranched lignin with a low MW of up to
about 4.5 kDa. Very similar scaling parameters with reasonable reproducibility
(α = 0.70 ± 0.02 and log K = −7.82
± 0.08) were obtained using the Mw(GPC) values. The least reliable seem to be the Mn values determined by GPC as they showed inferior reproducibility.

GPC (blue and orange lines, respectively) and the Mn values calculated from 1H NMR end-group analysis
(gray line). Error bars in the diffusion dimension correspond to the
associated standard error of the average diffusion coefficient of
each fraction. Error bars in the MW dimension correspond to the standard
error of the average MW values generated by doing the analysis in
triplicate.

The probe temperature was maintained at 295 K. Average diffusion coefficients
were used in the diffusion dimension of the chart. For polymer Ac-1(V), these were obtained by selecting 21 peaks for each
fraction spectra and taking the average of the calculated diffusion
coefficients of these peaks. For kraft lignin, these were obtained
by selecting only eight peaks for each fraction spectra because of
the broadness of the signals.

Kraft Lignin Fractionation
and Analysis
Kraft Lignin Fractionation
As the
simplest possible
lignin-like material, Ac-1(V) has the potential to serve
as a reference point in the tool kit for lignin characterization.
We assume that the fractionation and analytical methods that are presented
here could be applied to technical lignin samples. Kraft lignin was
chosen for this study because (i) it represents a significant percentage
of the lignin produced industrially at present and (ii) it is generally
accepted to be heavily condensed and as such provides the greatest
contrast to the linear Ac-1(V). To investigate the reproducibility
of the process, two fractionation experiments were performed (KL-1
and KL-2). To fractionate all of the kraft lignin, the concentration
range of acetone in diethyl ether had to be increased from 5% up to
70%, so 14 fractions in total were obtained per fractionation. The
fraction yield profiles were more complex than those obtained with Ac-1(V), showing two obvious regions that must correspond
to the components of kraft lignin with different physical properties
(e.g., solubility, Figure 4) which seems to be in accordance with the recently published
results by Crestini et al.10 The total
yield of the lighter fractions was low (25–30%) but followed
a near Gaussian distribution that was analogous to that observed for Ac-1(V). Significantly higher yields of the heavier fractions
were isolated, with a maximum average yield of about 25% being obtained
for fraction F10. The threshold between the two observed regions was
estimated to be at fraction F8. The fraction yield profiles of KL-1
and KL-2 were similar (Figure 4), showing the good reproducibility of the process.

Figure 4 Fraction yield
profiles of KL-1 (green series, overall yield of
89%) and KL-2 (brown series, overall yield of 85%). Two possible regions
were identified: (A) fractions 1–8—approximately Gaussian
distribution that, in the subsequent analysis, resulted in scaling
factors similar to those of Ac-1(V) and (B) fractions
9–14—approximately Gaussian distribution that, in the
subsequent analysis, gave scaling factors different from those of Ac-1(V). The similar pattern of fraction yield profiles was
taken to confirm reproducibility.

Analysis of the Fractions Derived from the Commercially Available
Kraft Lignin
GPC analysis of the 14 fractions showed that Mw steadily increased across the fractions from
900 (5% KL-1) to 10 300 (70% KL-2) g mol–1 (Table S12). No significant differences
in the Mw values were found for the corresponding
fractions between KL-1 and KL-2 fractionations (Table S12). However, considerable discrepancies were found
for the Mn values. For fractions F1–F8, Mn and Mw values
showed a trend analogous to that obtained for Ac-1(V), with the D̵M values ranging from
1.5 to 2 (Table S12). As the Mn values became more variable after fraction F8, the calculated D̵M values become considerably larger (Table S12). Moreover, a significant difference
in the Mn values obtained was observed
for the two fractionations (KL-1 and KL-2, Table S11). The threshold observed for the discrepancies of the Mn values seems to correlate quite closely with
the one between the two regions proposed in the fraction yield profile
(Figure 4). It was
not possible to determine the Mn values
by quantitative 1H NMR end-group analysis as signals for
the end groups were not apparent in the 1D 1H NMR spectra.

As the Mw values were relatively consistent
across all fractions, data from both fractionations were combined
and fitted to the Mark–Houwink eq 1 against the average values of the diffusion coefficient
obtained for each fraction by DOSY NMR (Figure 5). For fractions F1–F10, a linear
correlation was obtained with R2 = 0.969.
The scaling factor (α = 0.59) is slightly lower than the empirical
scaling derived for the model polymer Ac-1(V) (α
= 0.66 ± 0.01). These findings imply that lighter fractions of
kraft lignin could be composed of chains similar to polymer Ac-1(V) rather than heavily branched macromolecules.23 Surprisingly, some recent results of the analysis
of kraft lignin fractions suggest the opposite.10,22 This could be possibly explained by the difference in fractionation
methods or a different source of kraft lignin with a different degree
of condensation and branching.

Figure 5 Scaling of diffusion coefficients with
the MW kraft fractions (blue:
KL-1 and red: KL-2). The green trend line corresponds to the combination
of fractions F1–F10 from both KL-1 and KL-2 fractionations.
The red trend line corresponds to the combination of fractions F11–F14
from both fractionations. Linear equations and R2 values are color-coded for the trend line they correspond
to.

After fraction F11, there was
a dramatic divergence from the F1–F10
linear polymer region and a sudden increase in the scaling of the
diffusion coefficient with MW was observed. The trend is opposite
to the one that would be expected in the case of extensive branching
(condensation) of lignin macromolecules. The unphysically large scaling
exponent in this region is likely artifactual. However, there might
be possible explanations for this phenomenon that still provide information
about the polymer. We suppose that the Mw values that were determined by GPC might be underestimated. It is
known that branched lignin macromolecules have smaller hydrodynamic
radii than the random-coil polystyrene GPC standards of the same MW
and therefore elute with longer retention times.39 Consequently, any efforts to make cross comparisons of
volume–MW relationships between lignin and other polymers might
be subject to substantial errors. Unfortunately, without a reliable
alternative means of determining the MW of lignin fractions at our
disposal, we are not able to confirm this hypothesis. Another source
of error could stem from limitations in the DOSY NMR method. The analysis
has been carried out using standard equipment that can deliver gradient
pulses of limited strength. The inability to apply strong enough gradient
pulses was compensated for by using very long diffusion delays. This
could possibly result in the overestimation of the D values for heavier fractions of lignin. Repeating the experiments
using a specialized diffusion NMR equipment could possibly clarify
this issue.

To support our hypothesis that kraft lignin is composed
of two
components with different physical properties, the fractions were
analyzed further by another magnetic resonance method. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra did not show any considerable differences across
the fractions apart from the expected broadening of resonances for
heavier fractions (Figure S8). Likewise,
qualitative comparison of HSQC spectra did not reveal any  insights
into the proposed two types of kraft lignin. However, collation of
absolute integrals showed a steady decline of cross-peak intensities
toward heavier fractions which can be related to the dependence of T1 and T2 relaxation
times on mobility and size of the molecules (Figure 6). Another interesting phenomenon becomes
apparent when intensities of the cross-peaks (b) and (c) are compared.
These cross-peaks represent a diastereotopic pair of protons hence
should show equal intensity (for assignment, see Figure S9). This holds true only for the two lightest fractions.
The differences observed in heavier fractions are likely created by
the effect of restricted local mobility on relaxation times. These
findings imply that HSQC spectra of unfractionated lignin with a high D̵M value are dominated by the resonances
of lighter fractions and might not represent the true overall structure
of lignin. The effect of T1 relaxation
time can certainly be diminished by the use of relaxation agents and/or
an increased interscan delay. However, using a relaxation delay of
15 s, that would assure, according to our measurements, full longitudinal
relaxation of all 1H resonances in unfractionated polydisperse
samples of lignin, makes the HSQC experiment very long and unpractical
(see Figure S10). Furthermore, the effect
of the T2 relaxation time on the INEPT
transfer in the HSQC methods cannot be corrected.12 From this perspective, any attempts to use HSQC spectra
in a quantitative manner for lignin characterization are questionable
and the need to combine fractionation methods with other means of
characterization for the analysis of such complex materials as kraft
lignin becomes even more apparent.

Figure 6 Absolute integral intensities of selected
cross-peaks in the HSQC
spectra of kraft lignin fractions (KL-2). (a) α proton β-O-4
linkage δC/δH—73.2–75.6/6.01–5.864,
(b) γ-1 proton β–β linkage δC/δH—71.7/4.2, and (c) γ-2 proton β–β
linkage δC/δH—71.7/3.9. The
decline toward heavier fractions clearly demonstrates the effect of
MW on the intensities of HSQC cross-peaks caused by the dependence
of T1 and T2 relaxation times on mobility and size of the molecules.

Seeking further evidence for the differences between
the fractions
of kraft lignin lead us to use continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy. It
is known that lignin isolated from biomass contains significant amounts
of stable organic radicals, and therefore EPR spectroscopy has become
an increasingly popular method for the characterization of this material.40,41 The results from the measurement of radical concentrations in samples
of crude, acetylated, and fractionated kraft lignin are summarized
in Figure 7. Comparison
of the values obtained for crude and acetylated bulk samples implies
that acetylation of kraft lignin decreased the concentration of free
radicals by a factor of about 2. It is generally assumed that the
sources of unpaired electrons in lignin are semiquinone radicals stabilized
in the polyphenolic lignin matrix. Upon acetylation, the number of
phenolic hydroxyl groups should be considerably reduced which is in
accordance with diminishing radical concentration per milligram.
However, the remaining radical content likely implies that the acetylation
of the bulk lignin sample was not fully accomplished. For only lighter
acetylated lignin fractions (F1–F10), the radical concentration
is rather low (below 1 × 1014) and only a subtle increase
with MW is apparent. On the contrary, the heavy fractions (F11–F14)
show radical concentrations above the one that was found for the bulk
acetylated lignin. We assume that one possible explanation could be
that the lower reactivity of phenolic groups in the heavier fractions
results in a lower degree of acetylation. However, we are currently
unable to make an unambiguous conclusion about this phenomenon as
radical concentrations in unacetylated kraft lignin fractions are
unknown. Nevertheless, the threshold between heavy and light fractions
roughly correlates with that suggested previously based on the fractionation
yield profile (Figure 4) and DOSY NMR analysis (Figure 5). Hence, we assume that the results of EPR analysis
support the hypothesis that two very different components of kraft
lignin exist.

Figure 7 Radical concentrations in spins per mg of sample mass
for crude,
acetylated bulk kraft lignin and appropriate fractions. Uncertainties
in the number of spins per milligram of sample were estimated from
the respective weighing and volumetric errors and the corrected standard
deviations of triplicate measurements propagated to spins per weight.

Experimental Section
All NMR analyses of polymer and lignin samples were carried out
using a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled
TCI CryoProbe (Prodigy). The samples were prepared by dissolving 60
mg of material in 0.7 mL of DMSO-d6. The
samples were then sonicated for 30 min at 35 °C and then filtered
through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filter.
Quantitative 1H NMR spectra were acquired with the standard
pulse sequence from the Bruker library (zg) and used
a 30 s interscan (D1) delay. HSQC spectra
were acquired using the hsqcetgpsp.2 pulse sequence
with a spectral width of 86 ppm and 126 points in the indirect dimension
(D1 = 1 s, ns = 12) and a total experimental
time of 30 min.

DOSY experiments were acquired using the ledbpgp2s pulse sequence. Gradient amplitude (6.56 G mm–1) was calibrated using the residual signal of HDO
in D2O sample. The diffusion delay (Δ) and gradient
pulse length
(δ) were optimized for each sample to achieve ca. 5–10%
residual signal at 98% gradient strength (compared to 10% gradient
strength) using the 1D DOSY experiment with the ledbpgp2s1d pulse sequence. Each pseudo-2D experiment consisted
of a series of 32 spectra acquired with 65 536 data points.
The gradient pulses were incremented from 10 to 98% with a linear
ramp. All samples were allowed to thermally equilibrate prior to optimizing
the DOSY parameters (Δ and δ), and the temperature was
set and maintained at 295 K during the experiments. Data sets were
processed by Fourier transformation in F2, using a line broadening of 10 Hz, followed by a baseline correction.
The DOSY analysis was then performed in Bruker Dynamics Center 2.3.
Manual peak picking was performed for each data set, and the peak
intensities were used to measure the signal decay. Error estimation
of the fit was performed at 95% confidence level. Further particulars
of the DOSY NMR method can be found in Figure S6.

polymer and

Conclusions
In
this study, we have described an optimized scalable synthesis
of 1. The resulting polymer was acetylated to increase
its solubility and then completely fractionated using the volatile
organic solvents acetone and diethyl ether, with no insoluble fraction
being produced. This was achieved by using incremental increases in
the percentage of acetone up to 45%, leading to a series of fractions
that were then analyzed by GPC, 1H end-group analysis,
and DOSY NMR. Good linear log–log correlations of the average
diffusion coefficient and average MWs Mw and Mn were obtained. The average molecular
scaling exponent α = 0.66 ± 0.01 corresponds to a flexible
linear polymer in a good solvent and could be possibly used as an
empirical Mark–Houwink parameter for a quick DOSY NMR assessment
of the MW of light fractions of unbranched lignin. Although GPC is
well established in polymer chemistry, some findings in this
paper suggest that it might not work that well for lignin samples
that are composed of smaller, oligomer-like (ca. up to 10 kDa), molecules
and/or have rather heterogeneous character. Therefore, we believe
that the DOSY NMR method could possibly deliver faster and more accurate
results.

This concept was explored further through the use of
a commercial
sample of kraft lignin which was fractionated using the same protocol.
In this case, higher concentrations of acetone had to be used to fractionate
the whole bulk material and a greater number of fractions were obtained.
A clear threshold was observed in the fraction yield analysis, showing
that the majority of kraft lignin (about 70%) was dissolved using
concentrations of acetone higher than 45%. For the lighter fractions
of kraft lignin, scaling of diffusion coefficients with MW (α
= 0.59) is very similar to that observed for Ac-1(V) which
leads to the conclusion that these fractions are primarily made of
linear flexible macromolecules. The sudden change in α, observed
for the heavy fractions (F11–F14), implies that the bulk material
of the acetylated kraft lignin might be composed of a second component
with significantly different physical properties. This hypothesis
is supported by the results of continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy that
show a significant increase in the radical concentration for the heavy
fractions. Although we are unable to make unambiguous conclusions
about the precise structural differences at this time, we assume that
lighter fractions of lignin are made of smaller molecules with simpler
linear structures that could be more suitable materials for exploring
lignin depolymerization reactions than the crude unfractionated lignin.
