The major focus of the present work
lies in exploring the influence
of nanoconfinement within aerosol-OT (AOT) reverse micelles on the
binding interaction of two phenazinium-based photosensitizers, namely,
phenosafranin (PSF) and safranin-O (SO), with the DNA duplex. Circular
dichroism and dynamic light-scattering studies reveal the condensation
of DNA within the reverse micellar interior (transformation of the
B-form of native DNA to ψ-form). Our results unveil a remarkable
effect of the degree of hydration of the reverse micellar core on
the stability of the stacking interaction (intercalation) of the drugs
(PSF and SO) into DNA; increasing size of the water nanopool (that
is, w0) accompanies decreasing curvature
of the DNA duplex structure with the consequent effect of increasing
stabilization of the drug:DNA intercalation. The marked differences
in the dynamical aspects of the interaction scenario following encapsulation
within the reverse micellar core and the subsequent dependence on
the size of the water nanopool are also meticulously explored. The
differential degrees of steric interactions offered by the drug molecules
(presence of methyl substitutions on the planar phenazinium ring in
SO) are also found to affect the extent of intercalation of the drugs
to DNA. In this context, it is imperative to state that the water
pool of the reverse micellar core is often argued to approach bulk-like
properties of water with increasing micellar size (typically w0 ≥ 10), so that deviation from the bulk
water properties is likely to be minimized in large reverse micelles
(w0 ≥ 10). On the contrary, our
results (particularly quantitative elucidation of micropolarity and
dynamical aspects of the interaction) explicitly demonstrate that
the bulk-like behavior of the nanoconfined water is not truly achieved
even in large reverse micelles.

1 Introduction
The
stable storage of crucial genetic information by deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) is central to the development, sustaining, and functioning
of various life forms and many viruses.1−4 Naturally, DNA has navigated the nucleus
of a myriad of research activities for years, in particular, the remarkable
upsurge of contemporary research on the application of DNA in the
recognition of affinity biosensors,5 the
development of effective pharmaceutics in regulatory gene expression,1−4,6 as well as development of safe-engineered
DNA-targeted therapeutics.7,8 However, as the physiologically
active conformation of DNA usually evolves in a condensed form (such
as chromatin), the mechanistic understanding of the molecular recognition
of DNA must be explored in the condensed form of DNA. To date in vitro condensation of DNA has been reported with various
polymers and salts.9−11 However, the application of the aerosol-OT (AOT)
reverse micellar core as the condensing media for DNA in solution
is comparatively sporadically addressed in the literature.10,12−15 It is usually argued that the spatial constraints within the reverse
micellar nanoconfinements and low dielectric constant of the central
water pool play the key roles for condensation of DNA.10,13 The degree of hydration of the nanopool of water entrapped within
the reverse micelle is also reported to be crucial in the condensation
phenomenon as well as in governing the degree of compactness of DNA.15−20

The present study demonstrates the application of AOT reverse
micelle
as a condensing media to exploit the effect of nanoconfinement on
the binding interaction of two phenazinium-based DNA intercalator
drugs, namely, phenosafranin (PSF, 3,7-diamino-5-phenyl phenazinium
chloride) and safranin-O (SO, 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl phenazinium
chloride) (Scheme 1). The photophysics of PSF and SO in various organized media is extensively
studied.21−30 The cationic drug molecules PSF and SO are reported to bind to DNA
principally by an intercalative mode of binding.21,22 The major focus of the present investigation aims at exploring how
the binding interaction of the drugs (PSF and SO) is influenced within
the nanoconfinements of reverse micelles. The variation of the binding
constant values and polarity surrounding the drug microenvironment
as a function of w0 within the reverse
micelle unveils the modification of the curvature of DNA within the
nanocage of the reverse micelles with increasing hydration (that is, w0) conveying the stabilization of the intercalative
binding interaction of the drugs with DNA.31 The broad spectrum of applications of this drug molecule belonging
to a family of phenazinium dyes differing in their degree of methyl
substitution expands their extensive use as photosensitizers,32,33 biological probes for estimation of hyaluronic acid, study of protein
immobilization, membrane organization, inhibition of human ribonuclease
reductase, and so forth.34−36

The unique property of reverse micellar systems incorporating a
small volume of water inside their nanoscopic core paves the way for
multitudes of applications including the study of complex biological
and chemical reactions.37−39 The conjugate effects of confinement
and interactions with surfactant interface/headgroups lead to remarkable
deviations of the properties of the water in the nanopool from those
of bulk water.15,31,37−46 Furthermore, the degree of hydration within the reverse micellar
interior can be effectively tuned over a wide range of compositions
simply as a function of the water added:15,31,41−43,45 1  This provides an additional edge
toward probing
the complicated effects of hydration in a given biophysical process
for studies inside the reverse micellar core while keeping from the
functional and compositional complexities associated with them. The
properties of the nanoconfined water are usually reported to be enormously
different from those of bulk water, particularly in small reverse
micelles (w0 < 10).47,48 On the contrary, the properties of the intramicellar water are argued
to resemble those of bulk water with increasing hydration level (that
is, w0), and especially in large reverse
micelles (w0 ≥ 10) the properties
of water in the nanopool become essentially equivalent to those of
bulk water.48−50 Interestingly, our results explicitly show that the
microenvironments surrounding the drug molecules within the present
experimental window remain significantly different from those of bulk
water even in large reverse micelles. Particularly, the polarity of
the drug microenvironments and the dynamical aspects of the global
interaction scenario even in large reverse micelles (w0 > 10) have been demonstrated to be substantially
different
from those in bulk water.42

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Probing the Drug:DNA Interaction
2.1.1 Steady-State Absorption and Fluorescence
Spectroscopic Studies
The photophysical properties of the
dyes PSF and SO in bulk homogeneous solvents have been extensively
characterized in the literature.21−26,28−30,51−57 In bulk aqueous medium PSF and SO show the lowest energy absorption
band at ∼520 nm and a broad unstructured fluorescence band
at ∼585 nm arising from charge transfer emission. The characteristic
absorption and fluorescence profiles of the dyes are known to be sensitive
to solvent polarity, the presence of external additives, and specific
interactions with microheterogeneous assemblies.21−30,51−57 As a result, these dyes have been extensively used as extrinsic
molecular probes for a variety of organized media and microheterogeneous
assemblies.21−30,51−57

Before moving onto probing the modulation of the drug:DNA
interaction within the nanoconfinements of AOT reverse micelles, it
is pertinent to unveil the pattern of interaction of the individual
drug molecules (PSF and SO) with DNA alone. To this end, the drug:DNA
interaction has been first investigated by spectroscopic techniques.

The absorption profiles of PSF and SO show quite similar broad
unstructured bands having maxima at ∼520 nm in bulk aqueous
buffer. These results are found to be in good agreement with a large
volume of literature reports.23−26,28−30,51−57 The occurrence of drug:DNA interaction is indicated by the decrease
in absorbance and significant red-shift of the absorption profile
following interaction with DNA (Figure 1).21,22 In this context, it is intriguing
to note the varying extents of red-shift for the drugs at the respective
saturation levels of interaction, Δλ ∼ 17 nm for
PSF and Δλ ∼ 13 nm, for SO which readily suggests
that the microenvironment in the vicinity of the drug molecules within
the DNA scaffolds is not precisely the same (Figure 1).21,22 A lesser extent of
spectral modulation with SO compared to that with PSF may be comprehended
from the possibility of greater degree of steric interaction with
SO (because of the presence of the methyl substitutions on the planar
phenazinium nucleus, Scheme 1) which may lead to a lesser degree of intercalation of SO
compared to PSF within the DNA duplex. In analogy with reported literature,21,22 the red-shift of the absorption wavelength of the drugs (PSF and
SO) within the DNA-bound state can be rationalized based on the modulation
(decrease) of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the drugs.

24.32, 30.4, 36.48, 48.64, 54.72, 60.8, 76.0, 106.4, 136.8, 152.0,
and 182.4 μM. (B) Modulation of (left) absorption and (right)

40.6, 44.66, 52.78, 60.9, and 69.02 μM.

The fluorescence profiles of both the drugs (PSF and SO)
were displayed
by broad, structureless bands having maxima at λem∼ 585 nm (Figure 1). The occurrence of the drug:DNA interaction is found to
be characterized by prominent quenching of fluorescence intensity
coupled with a marginal blue-shift (Δλ ∼ 6 nm)
of the fluorescence wavelength (Figure 1). These results corroborate well to the literature
reports on the study of interaction of phenazinium drugs with DNA.21,22 The fluorescence excitation spectra of the drugs are also found
to well corroborate to the absorption spectral changes upon interaction
with DNA (figure not shown) implying that the DNA-induced modulations
in the fluorescence profiles of the drugs originate from photoexcitation
of the respective ground-state species.49,58

In this
context, it is important to establish the mode of binding
of the drugs with the DNA duplex. For this purpose, the circular dichroism
spectroscopic technique has been exploited here. The intrinsic far-UV
circular dichroic profile of DNA shows a positive peak at ∼276
nm and a negative peak at ∼247 nm, typically signifying the
hallmark of the native right-handed B-form of DNA21,22,59−61 (Figure S1of Supporting Information). The characteristic CD
signal of B-DNA is attributed to the asymmetric environments surrounding
the DNA bases owing to their stacking interactions and the helical
suprastructure of the polynucleotide backbone. Thus, perturbation
of the intrinsic CD signal of B-DNA categorically reflects an intercalative
mode of binding emanating from alteration of the relative orientation
of the DNA bases required to accommodate the intercalated drug(s).
On the contrary, an electrostatic or groove binding is manifested
by no (or only nominal) perturbation of the intrinsic CD spectrum
of DNA as this induces no (or only insignificant) change on the relative
orientation of the DNA bases.21,22,59−61 Consequently, the modulation of the intrinsic CD
profile of DNA following interaction with the drugs (PSF and SO) (Figure S1) implies perturbation of the stacking
contacts of the DNA bases and hence establishes an intercalative mode
of binding.21,22,59−61

2.1.2 Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Decay Studies
Despite the spectroscopic characterization
of the drug:DNA interaction
with PSF and SO, the dynamical aspects of the interaction have not
been previously addressed in the literature.60−64 Herein, the modulations in fluorescence decay behavior
of the drugs (PSF and SO) following interaction with DNA are meticulously
explored. In aqueous buffer, both the drugs PSF and SO are found to
exhibit single exponential decay (λex = 450 nm and
λem = 585 nm) having characteristic lifetimes of
τ1 ∼ 868 ps and τ1 ∼
1020 ps, respectively.13,59,60,65 The variations of the fluorescence transients
of the drugs with added DNA are displayed in Figure 2 with the deconvoluted data being presented
in Table 1. A glimpse
on the tabulated data reflects a complicated decay pattern of the
drugs within the DNA scaffolds which in turn requires a triexponential
decay function for an adequate description of the data (Table 1). Apart from the characteristic
lifetime of the free (or unbound) drugs (τ1 in Table 1), the interaction
of the drugs with DNA results in the genesis of another slow (τ3) and an ultrafast (τ2) decay component (Table 1). The pattern of
modulation of the fluorescence decay behavior of the drug molecules
(PSF and SO) with added DNA is found to be consistent with the decay
behavior of the drugs in several other microheterogeneous environments
as studied in our lab (unpublished results). In both the cases (PSF
and SO), the amplitude (α1) corresponding to the
lifetime of the free drug (τ1) gradually decreases,
whereas the amplitudes (α2 and α3) of the newly generated ultrafast (τ2) and relatively
slow (τ3) decay components increase with added DNA
(Table 1). Thus, the
occurrence of the drug:DNA interaction can be argued on the basis
of a steady increase (decrease) of the amplitudes corresponding to
the characteristic lifetimes of the bound (unbound) drugs with increasing
DNA concentration. It is noteworthy at this juncture that the increase
of population of the bound drugs (as estimated from the magnitudes
of the corresponding amplitudes, Table 1) with added DNA is relatively greater in the case
of PSF than SO which essentially reveals a greater extent of intercalation
of PSF than SO. In conformity with the steady-state results stated
earlier, a greater extent of intercalative interaction of PSF than
SO can be intertwined with the greater degree of steric repulsion
present in SO because of the methyl substitutions on the planar phenazinium
ring (Scheme 1).

2.2 Characterization of DNA Conformation within
Reverse Micellar Nanoconfinement
2.2.1 Circular
Dichroism Spectroscopy
The circular dichroism (CD) spectral
profiles of DNA within the nanoconfinement
of the reverse micelle system are displayed in Figure 3. The CD profile of DNA in bulk aqueous buffer
conforms to the characteristic features of the native B-form of DNA.
In contrast, the CD profiles of DNA within the reverse micelles (at w0 = 4 and 16) exhibit an increase in molar ellipticity
values at the negative as well as positive wavelengths coupled with
significant absorption at the longer wavelength tail (Figure 3), thus conforming to the transition
of B-DNA in aqueous buffer to the ψ-form of DNA within the nanoscopic
environment of the reverse micelles.11,14,22,61,66

Figure 3 Circular

with variation of w0 as specified in the
figure legend.

2.2.2 Dynamic
Light Scattering
Figure 4 shows a representative
example of the DLS profiles of AOT reverse micelle with w0 = 20 in the absence and presence of added DNA. The DLS
profile of the reverse micelle (w0 = 20)
without DNA exhibits a fairly monomodal distribution having hydrodynamic
diameter dh = 9 ± 1 nm (polydispersity
index = 11%) bearing reasonable resemblance with reported literature.10,12,15,31 The scattered intensity distribution profile of the reverse micelle
containing DNA conspicuously reflects the presence of large-sized
reverse micelles (DNA containing reverse micelles having dh = 145 ± 17 nm (polydispersity index = 12%)) in
addition to the smaller ones (that is, empty reverse micelles).10,12,15,31 The presence of large reverse micelles containing encapsulated DNA
(dh ∼ 145 nm) has also been confirmed
with AOT reverse micelles ([AOT] = 0.1 M) at various degrees of hydration
(that is, w0 = 10, 12, 16) (results not
shown). It is imperative to note that though the size of the large
reverse micelles containing DNA is in good harmony with reported literature10,12,15,31 the DLS study may not be adequate in determining the actual morphology
of these reverse micelles because the reverse micellar particles containing
DNA may not be truly spherical.12,15 The central water pool
of the AOT reverse micelle should be rich in negative charge density
due to the anionic headgroup of the surfactant, which in turn is likely
to govern the distribution of DNA having highly negative polyphosphate
backbone within the intra (reverse) micellar nanopool of water rather
than the headgroup or interfacial micellar region and thus accompanying
the transformation of the B-form of DNA into its condensed ψ-form
(as evidenced from the CD spectral results discussed above).

shows the DLS profile of AOT reverse micelle (w0 = 20) without DNA.

2.3 Drug:DNA Complex within the AOT Reverse Micelle
2.3.1 Steady-State Spectroscopic Studies
Extensive broadening
of the absorption profile of drug:DNA complexes
within AOT reverse micelles of varying w0 prohibited the extraction of meaningful results with required degree
of precision. However, the excitation spectra produce relatively sharper
profiles, thus allowing a precise perusal of the modulation of the
spectral properties. Nevertheless, it is imperative to note in this
context that the study of the interaction of the drug:DNA complex
within the nanocompartmentalization of AOT reverse micelles remains
susceptible to significant experimental artifacts emanating from the
possibility of partitioning of the drug molecules in various microheterogeneous
environments.15 Thus, intensive care has
been taken for rationalization of the spectral properties in this
concern. To this end, our first attempt involves the use of a relatively
high concentration of DNA in comparison to the drug concentration
([drug]:[DNA] = 1:28, molar ratio) in order to ensure complete complexation.

The excitation spectra of the drug:DNA complex in AOT reverse micelle
with increasing w0 display a gradual decrease
in intensity with a small blue shift (Δλ ∼ 4 nm)
(Figure 5A). It is
worth mentioning that these results apparently contrast the modulation
of absorption spectral behavior of the drug molecules alone within
AOT reverse micelles (which shows a significant red-shift of ∼10
nm following encapsulation within the reverse micellar nanocage, which
is rather insensitive to the variation of the water pool size, that
is, variation of w0).65 Thus, an effective entrapment of the drug:DNA complexes
within the reverse micellar nanopool of water can be logically assumed.

of (A) excitation and (B) fluorescence (λex = 520
nm) spectral profiles of (left) DNA-bound PSF and
(right) DNA-bound SO within AOT reverse micelle with variation of w0. Curves i → vii represent w0 = 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 16, and 20.

The characteristic broad, unstructured fluorescence profiles
of
the phenazinium dyes (PSF and SO) in bulk aqueous buffer having maxima
at ∼585 nm undergo prominent fluorescence quenching coupled
with a slight blue-shift upon interaction with DNA (λem ∼ 581 nm) (Figure 1). However, encapsulation of the drug:DNA complex within the
AOT reverse micelle (w0 = 1) is characterized
by a marked blue-shift (λem ∼ 562 nm) as depicted
in Figure 5B. With
increasing size of the nanopool of compartmentalized water within
the AOT reverse micelle the fluorescence profile of the drug:DNA complex
is found to undergo moderate reduction of fluorescence intensity together
with a small red-shift of the fluorescence wavelength (λem ∼ 570 nm at w0 = 20)
(Figure 5B). This can
be rationalized based on the notion of increasing polarity surrounding
the microenvironment of the drugs with increasing degree of hydration,
that is, increasing w0. Furthermore, it
is known that the interfacial fluidity of the interacting reverse
micelles increases with increasing nanopool size (that is, w0).41−44 This can be argued to reflect an increasing degree
of stabilization of the stacking (intercalation) interaction of the
drugs (PSF and SO) into the DNA duplex with decreasing DNA curvature
accompanying increasing hydration of the reverse micelle (that is,
increasing w0).15,31 However, the significant deviation of the fluorescence spectral
characteristics of the drug:DNA complex within the reverse micelles
from that in bulk aqueous buffer or within the DNA scaffolds reflects
that the microenvironment surrounding the DNA-bound drugs is remarkably
different within the reverse micelles even at high w0 (that is, large reverse micelles).

2.3.2 Polarity of the Drug Microenvironment
A quantitative
estimation of the polarity surrounding the drug
microenvironment under various experimental conditions has been elucidated
on the basis of polarity-sensitive fluorescence properties of the
drugs (PSF and SO). The characteristic fluorescence maxima of the
drugs (PSF and SO) are found to display a significant blue-shift with
decreasing medium polarity, e.g., λem ∼ 585
nm, in bulk aqueous medium and λem ∼ 564 nm
in 1,4-dioxane (Figure S2). Drawing on
this, a calibration curve is constructed by observing the variation
of the characteristic fluorescence wavelength of the drugs (PSF and
SO) in a reference solvent mixture of water/1,4-dioxane of varying
compositions having known polarity (on ET(30) scale).67 The polarity surrounding
the drug microenvironment under the as-employed experimental conditions
is then evaluated by the method of interpolation on the calibration
curve (a detailed description of the results and experimental protocol
is provided in the Supporting Information).

Figure 6 displays
the variation of micropolarity surrounding the drug as a function
of w0 when the drug:DNA complex is encapsulated
within the reverse micellar core. A steady increase of polarity (on ET(30) scale) of the drug microenvironment with
increasing w0 (ET(30) (kcal mol–1) = 47.1 at w0 = 1 and 53.06 at w0 = 20
for DNA-bound PSF; ET(30) (kcal mol–1) = 49.4 at w0 = 1 and 53.8 at w0 = 20 for DNA-bound SO) is found to be consistent with the notion
of increasing polarity with increasing water content (increasing w0) of the reverse micellar water pool and thus
accounts for the gradual red-shift of the fluorescence wavelength
of the drug:DNA complex within the reverse micelle with increasing w0. It is usually argued that the water molecules
near the interface can be engaged in hydration of the anionic AOT
headgroups, in sodium counterions, or in interaction with other water
molecules.41−43 The water molecules at the interface perturbed by
interactions with surfactant headgroups or sodium counterions continuously
equilibrate with bulk-like water molecules present in the reverse
micellar interior.42 Thus, it is not surprising
that a polarity-sensitive probe molecule (here PSF and SO) will sense
a lower polarity of the central water pool in small reverse micelles
(that is, small w0). However, in large
reverse micelles, typically w0 ≥
10, with increasing water content of the central pool the intramicellar
water is often argued to resemble bulk-like properties of water.15,45,47,49,68 It is crucial to note that the micropolarity
of the DNA-bound drugs within the reverse micelle-encapsulated state
even at the highest w0 studied, that is, w0 = 20, still remains notably lower (more hydrophobic
environment; ET(30) (kcal mol–1) = 53.06 at w0 = 20 for DNA-bound PSF; ET(30) (kcal mol–1) = 53.8
at w0 = 20 for DNA-bound SO) compared
to that in the drug:DNA complex in the bulk aqueous buffer phase (ET(30) (kcal mol–1) = 61.23
for PSF and SO, Figure S2). Our results
thus comprehensively suggest that even in large reverse micelles (w0 ≥ 10) the properties of the nanopool
of water do not typically approach the bulk-like properties. This
is consistent with a recent simulation study which shows a marked
reduction of the dielectric constant of water upon confinement.69

Figure 6 Variation of polarity on ET(30) scale
around the drug microenvironment (PSF: −○–, SO:
−●−) as a function of w0 during incorporation of the drug:DNA complex within the AOT
reverse micelle. The solid lines are only a visual guide.

Furthermore, the data presented in Figure 6 reveal that the polarity surrounding
microenvironments
of the DNA-bound drugs at any given level of hydration of the reverse
micelle (that is, a given w0) is relatively
lower (more hydrophobic) for PSF compared to that for SO. In corroboration
to our earlier results, a lesser degree of intercalation of SO into
the DNA arising from the greater degree of steric hindrance due to
the presence of methyl substitutions on the planar phenezinium ring
(Scheme 1) can be argued
to provide a reasonable rationale underlying the aforesaid variation
of polarity.

2.3.3 Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Decay: Determination
of Drug:DNA Binding Constant
The modulation of fluorescence
decay transients of the drug:DNA complex entrapped in the AOT reverse
micellar systems as a function of w0 is
presented in Figure 7, and the relevant data are assembled in Table 2. At this stage, it is imperative to note
that the fluorescence decay behavior of the drugs alone (PSF and SO)
in AOT reverse micelles remarkably contrasts the present results;
the excited-state fluorescence lifetime of the AOT reverse micelle-encapsulated
drugs (PSF and SO) exhibits a monoexponential decay with a moderate
decrease of lifetime with increasing w0.65 On the contrary, the pattern of modulation
of the fluorescence decay parameters of the drug:DNA complex with
increasing w0 within the reverse micelle-encapsulated
state is found to bear reasonable harmony with the results obtained
in the course of binding interaction of the drugs with DNA. The data
summarized in Table 2 reveal that a triexponential decay function is required to aptly
describe the data. In analogy to the data for binding interaction
of the drugs (PSF and SO) with DNA as stated earlier (section 3.1.2, Table 1), the decay constant
τ1 can be ascribed to the free drug, while the occurrence
of the drug:DNA binding interaction is associated with the appearance
of a relatively slow (τ3) and an ultrafast (τ2) decay component (Table 2). Thus, a careful perusal of the decay parameters
(Table 2) enabled the
determination of a legitimate estimate of the variation of the fraction
of DNA-bound drug within AOT reverse micelles with increasing w0. A progressive increase of the population
of the bound drugs (as estimated from the gradual decrease of the
relative amplitude, α1, corresponding to the free
drug, Table 2) with
increasing w0 is found to be in good agreement
with our earlier results and thus reflects an enhanced stabilization
of the intercalative interaction of the drugs with DNA with increasing
nanopool size, that is, w0. In general,
a steady increase of the fluorescence lifetime values (Table 2) with incremental addition
of DNA suggests the impartation of increasing degree of motional restrictions
on the drug molecules.58−60 The data compiled in Table 2 further show that the relative population
of the DNA-bound drug at a given w0 within
the reverse micelles is greater for PSF in comparison to SO (as estimated
from the relative magnitudes of the amplitude, α1, corresponding to the free drug (Table 2)). This is consistent with the notion that
stabilization of the intercalative interaction of the drugs occurs
to a greater extent with PSF compared to SO, which in turn can be
rationalized on the basis of the greater degree of steric interaction
available with SO because of the presence of methyl substitutions
on the planar phenazinium nucleus (Scheme 1; such steric interaction may impede the
stacking interaction of the cationic dyes within the DNA base pairs).38

Herein,
the variation of the fluorescence decay characteristics
of the drug:DNA complex encapsulated in AOT reverse micelles as a
function of w0 is further processed toward
an endeavor to elucidate a relative estimate of the variation of the
drug:DNA binding constant (K). Knowing the total
concentrations of the drugs and DNA (as determined from their respective
molar absorption coefficient values, Section 2) and the signature of the relative population
of the drug:DNA complex obtained from analysis of the decay parameters,
the binding constant (K) values are estimated using
the following equation31 2  where the terms within square brackets indicate
the molar concentrations of the respective species. The variation
of the binding constant values as a function of w0 (Figure 8) unveils a discernible increase with increasing water loading (that
is, w0) of the interacting reverse micelles.
This is consistent with the decreasing curvature of DNA within the
nanocage of the reverse micelles with increasing hydration (that is, w0), leading to the resultant effect of increasing
degree of stabilization of the intercalative binding interaction of
the drugs with DNA.

Figure 8 Relative estimate of the variation of drug:DNA binding
constant
(K) with variation of w0 within the AOT reverse micelle for PSF (−○−)
and SO (−●−). The solid lines are only a visual
guide to the pattern of variation.

Furthermore, a comparatively higher binding constant (K) for PSF:DNA interaction than that for SO:DNA interaction
at a given w0 within the reverse micelle
is in parity with
the lesser extent of intercalation of SO into the DNA duplex owing
to the presence of greater degree of steric hindrance available with
SO because of the methyl substitutions present on the planar phenazinium
nucleus (Scheme 1).

2.3.4 Rotational Relaxation Dynamics
a Rotational Relaxation Dynamics of the Drugs
within the DNA-Intercalated State
The study of rotational
relaxation dynamics of the drugs within the DNA-intercalated state
can provide critical insights regarding the interaction behavior of
the drugs with DNA. To this end, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy
decay transients of the drugs (PSF and SO) have been meticulously
explored in bulk aqueous buffer as well as within the DNA scaffolds
(Figure 9A). In bulk
aqueous buffer, both the drug molecules are found to exhibit monoexponential
anisotropy decay profiles having rotational correlation time of τr = 147 ± 6 ps for PSF and τr = 179 ±
7 ps for SO. A monoexponential anisotropy decay pattern is suggestive
of a homogeneous environment surrounding the drug molecules in aqueous
buffer.58,70−72 The lack of any significant
residual anisotropy (Figure 9A) further suggests that the rotational depolarization of
the drugs is essentially completed within the excited-state fluorescence
lifetime, as is also evidenced from the relatively slower lifetimes
of the drugs in aqueous buffer (PSF: τ1 = 868 ±
35 ps, SO: τ1 = 1020 ± 41 ps, Table 2).

fluorescence decay profiles (λex = 450 nm) of the
drugs (PSF (left panel) and SO (right panel))
following interaction with DNA. Curves i → iv represent [DNA]
= 0, 15.2, 60.8, 152 μM. (B) Modulation of time-resolved fluorescence
decay profiles (λex = 450 nm) of the DNA-bound drugs

with variation of w0. Curves i →

symbols represent the raw data, and the best fit lines are shown by
the solid lines.

The fluorescence depolarization
profiles of the drugs (PSF and
SO) are found to be remarkably modified in the presence of DNA, signifying
the occurrence of the drug:DNA interaction (Figure 8A). However, it is imperative to note that
the anisotropy decay transients of the DNA-bound drugs could not be
aptly described by a simple monoexponential or biexponential decay
function; rather the decay transients are found to produce a weak
signature of dip-and-rise decay profile, which is
also designated as associated anisotropy decay (Figure 9A).58,70−72 In general, the following observations are noted regarding the modulation
of anisotropy decay behavior of the drugs following interaction with
DNA: (i) with incremental addition of DNA the dip-and-rise anisotropy decay pattern (although weak) becomes relatively more
prominent, and (ii) at a given concentration of DNA, the dip-and-rise anisotropy decay pattern is comparatively more prominent with PSF
than SO (Figure 9A).

The glimpse of a dip-and-rise anisotropy decay
pattern for DNA-bound drugs reflects the spectroscopic signature for
the coexistence of at least two classes of population of fluorophores
having significantly different fluorescence lifetimes and rotational
correlation times.58,70−72 Usually, the
origin of such anisotropy decay profiles is associated with partial
encapsulation of the fluorophore molecule(s) with the ensuing effect
of a slow fluorescence lifetime and rotational correlation time emanating
from the bound part of the fluorophore, while on the contrary, the
unbound (or solvent exposed) functional moieties of the fluorophore
accounts for the ultrafast motions.58,70−72 According to literature reports,58,70−72 an associated exponential model can be exploited to describe such
dip-and-rise anisotropy decay, in which the fluorescence depolarization
parameters are coupled with the excited-state fluorescence decay parameters
through the following relationships 3  where the time-dependent
weighting factor
is described as 4  and the total
fluorescence intensity decay
is given as 5  and the time-dependent anisotropy decay profile
is then described as 6  The
terms αi and τi designate the corresponding
parameters for the fluorescence decay of the fluorophore (amplitude
and lifetime, respectively); τir represents the rotational relaxation time constant; and r0,i is the pre-exponential anisotropy (or fundamental
anisotropy).58 The coexistence of two remarkably
different fluorescence decay time constants is argued to be crucial
to underlying the origin of such dip-and-rise anisotropy decay behavior,
which rightfully rationalizes the importance on the time-dependent
weighting factor (fi(t)) as stated above in eqs 3 and 4.58,70−72 Evidently, the modulation of the fluorescence decay
behavior of the drugs (PSF and SO) within the DNA-intercalated state
is found to conform to this essential prerequisite as shown in Table 2. A monoexponential
decay behavior of the drugs in bulk aqueous buffer implies an essentially
homogeneous environment surrounding the drug molecules. However, the
marked modulation of the fluorescence decay behavior of the drugs
within the DNA scaffolds accompanies the genesis of an ultrafast (τ2) and a slow (τ3) decay component having
considerably different relative amplitudes (α2 and
α3) (Table 2). The differential fluorophore populations (justifying the
faster and slower decay components due to the solvent-exposed functional
moieties of the fluorophore and the embedded part, respectively) leading
to varying contributions to the total fluorescence decay (IT(t)), in conjunction with
their variable local mobilities, are argued to result in the dip-and-rise
fluorescence depolarization profile.43 Herein,
the necessity of introducing the “pseudorise” component
in the fitting analysis of the anisotropy decay transients is cross-validated
by a comparative scrutiny of the distribution of the weighted residuals
and the “goodness of fit” parameters as obtained for
various functions used for the fitting analyses (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).71

In this context, a careful perusal of the structural features
of
the drug molecules (PSF and SO) appears to provide a critical insight
into the rotational dynamical behavior in parity with the aforementioned
discussion. The optimized geometries of the drugs (PSF and SO, Scheme 1) reveal that the
drug molecules are not fully planar; the flanking benzene nucleus
is found to be slightly out-of-plane with respect to the planar phenazinium
rings in PSF and SO. Such geometric landscape of the drug molecules
provides a critical understanding in deciphering the mode of binding
of the drugs with DNA in the sense that the planar phenazinium ring
of the cationic drugs is suitably intercalated within the DNA base
pairs accounting for the embedded part of the fluorophore, while the
contiguous benzene nuclei accounts for the solvent-exposed part which
in turn leads to the ultrafast decay component found in the overall
fluorescence decay profile of the DNA-bound drugs (Table 2). Moreover, the general observation
that the dip-and-rise anisotropy decay pattern is
comparatively more prominent with PSF than SO at a given concentration
of DNA (Figure 9A)
can also be argued to be consistent with the interpretation of a lesser
extent of intercalation of SO as compared to PSF, as stated earlier
on the basis of a greater degree of steric bulk available with SO
because of the methyl substitutions present on the planar phenazinium
ring.

b Rotational Relaxation Dynamics of the Drug:DNA
Complex within the Nanocage of Reverse Micelles
Figure 9B illustrates the
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay transients of the drug:DNA
complexes entrapped within the nanocage of the reverse micelles as
a function of w0. The deconvoluted decay
parameters are summarized in Table S1.
In this context, it is noteworthy that the fluorescence anisotropy
decay transients of the drug:DNA complexes within the reverse micelle-encapsulated
state are remarkably different from those of the drugs in bulk aqueous
buffer phase and/or DNA-intercalated state (Figure 9A). The encapsulation of the drug:DNA complexes
within the nanoscope of the reverse micelles leads to a biexponential
anisotropy decay pattern (Figure 9B, Table S1 in Supporting Information) comprised of a major ultrafast component (τ1r)
along with a minor contribution from a relatively slower decay component
(τ2r) (Table S1). The
functional form anisotropy decay is described as49 7  and the average rotational
correlation time
is calculated from the following relationship49 8  where the α
terms represents the relative
amplitudes of the corresponding rotational correlation time constants
(τir).

At this point, it is
important to underscore that the anisotropy decay profiles of the
drugs (PSF and SO) alone in reverse micelles show significantly different
behavior in terms of a monoexponential decay profile with gradually
decreasing rotational correlation time with increasing w0.65 Herein, a progressive
increase of the average rotational relaxation time (⟨τr⟩, Table S1) of the drug:DNA
complex within the AOT reverse micelles with increasing hydration
(that is, w0) implies the impartation
of increasing degree of motional constraints on the drug molecules
as a function of w0. This finding reasonably
corroborates our earlier results in the sense that an increasing hydration
(that is, w0) of the reverse micelles
accompanies greater degree of stabilization of the intercalative interaction
of the drugs with DNA.

Initially, the observation of a biexponential
anisotropy decay
having two rotational relaxation time constants on markedly different
time scales appears to invoke the argument of contributions from bound
and unbound fractions of the total fluorophore population accounting
for the slow and fast decay components, respectively. However, this
would naturally entail the relative amplitudes (α1r and α2r) of the fast (τ1r) and
slow (τ2r) components to reflect the relative populations
of the unbound and bound fluorophores, respectively. Within the present
experimental window, the drug:DNA molar ratio is maintained at [drug]:[DNA]
= 1:28 in order to ensure a complete complexation naturally and does
not conform to the magnitudes of the relative amplitudes (α1r and α2r, Table S1) and thus leads to negating this proposition.

Based on numerous
literature reports,58−60,71−78 we have resorted to the application of the wobbling in cone model for a fruitful rationalization of such fluorescence anisotropy
decay patterns. This model describes the global fluorescence depolarization
of a fluorophore encapsulated within a macromolecular system by interplay
of various motions treated independently:58−60,71−78(i) wobbling
motion of the fluorophore
having characteristic time constants, τw

(ii) translational motion
of the fluorophore
along the surface of the microheterogeneous system/aggregate having
characteristic time constant, τD, and

(iii) overall rotational dynamics of the
macromolecular system/aggregate having characteristic time constant,
τP.



At the outset, the
involvement of more than one type of rotational
motions can simply be invoked to rationalize the deviation of the
anisotropy decay profiles of drug:DNA complex within the reverse micellar
encapsulated state from a monoexponential pattern. The overall wobbling
motion (τw) of the fluorophore is connected to the
individual fast (τ1r) and slow (τ2r) anisotropy decay components as follows:58−60,71−78 9  According
to the wobbling in cone model the
rotational motion of the drug molecules can be characterized by a
single (isotropic) diffusion coefficient (Dw) within a cone of semiangle θw; however, the diffusion
motion is energetically prohibited to penetrate the rest of the space.
This restricts the limiting potential describing the rotational motion
by θw = θmax.58−60,71−79 Thus, according to this model, the faster rotational relaxation
(τ1r) is essentially treated as the wobbling motion
of a restricted rotor having transition dipoles undergoing orientational
relaxation in a cone of semiangle θw. The slower
rotational relaxation (τ2r), however, accounts for
the global orientational diffusion which subsequently leads to orientational
randomization (that is, orientational diffusion under no angular restriction).
The geometric restraint governing the rotational motion of the fluorophore
within the conical volume of semiangle θw is linked
to the generalized order parameter (S) through the
following relationship:58−60,71−79 10  The
physical significance of the order parameter
(S) can be realized in terms of revelation of the
degree of spatial restriction imposed on the drug molecules within
the limit:58−60,71−79 11  where a complete restriction on the
rotational
motion is designated by S = 1 and an unrestricted
motion by S = 0.

The rotational decay parameters
calculated from the analysis based
on the wobbling in cone model are assembled in Table S1. A gradual increase of the order parameter (S) with increasing w0 is consistent
with the idea of impartation of increasing degree of motional restrictions
on the rotational degrees of freedom of the drug molecules. This is
further substantiated from the progressive decrease of the semiangle
(θw) with increasing w0 (Table S1). These results corroborate
well to the variation (increasing) of average rotational correlation
time of the reverse micelle-encapsulated drug:DNA complex with increasing w0.

The wobbling diffusion coefficient
(Dw) values are evaluated using the following
relationship58−60,71−80 12  and for θw > 30°, Dw is given as 13  where x = cos θw.

As exemplified by the data presented in Table S1, the semiangle θw < 30° in the
present case of study, thus eq 13 is used for calculation of Dw.

Usually, a faster water relaxation dynamics within reverse
micelles
with increasing w0 results in lowering
of fluorescence anisotropy of the reverse micelle-encapsulated drug
molecules as the water pool size (that is, w0) increases.60 However, the typically
contrasting results obtained with DNA-bound drugs within the reverse
micelle even at high w0 (large reverse
micelle) imply that the microenvironments surrounding the drug molecules
do not approach bulk-like aqueous environment even in large reverse
micelles.

3 Conclusions
The
salient findings of the present investigation can be summarized
as follows:

First, the condensation of the DNA duplex structure
within the
reverse micellar core is found to accompany significant modification
of the binding interaction (intercalation) of the phenazinium drugs
(PSF and SO) to DNA as compared to that in bulk aqueous buffer phase.
The gradual increase of the drug:DNA binding constant values as a
function of w0 reveals a discernible increase
with increasing degree of hydration of the nanopool of water (that
is, w0) of the interacting reverse micelles.
This is consistent with the decreasing curvature of DNA within the
nanocage of the reverse micelles with increasing w0, leading to increasing degree of stabilization of the
intercalative binding interaction of the drugs with DNA.

Our
results also unveil the impact of steric hindrance available
with SO due to the presence of methyl substitution on the planar phenazinium
ring leading to a lesser extent of intercalation of SO compared to
PSF.

Second, a meticulous comparison of the spectroscopic and
dynamical
aspects of the interactions within the reverse micellar core with
those obtained in bulk aqueous buffer conspicuously reveals that the
properties of the nanoconfined water in reverse micelles do not typically
approach the bulk-like properties even in large reverse micelles (w0 = 10 or more).42 This is in apparent contradiction with many literature reports15,45,47,49,68 characterizing the water in large reverse
micelles (that is, w0 ≥ 10) as
bulk water.

4.1 Materials
The drugs Phenosafranin
(PSF) and Safranin-O (SO) (Scheme 1), herring sperm DNA, Tris-HCl buffer, and the surfactant
sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (Aerosol-OT, abbreviated as
AOT) were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., USA. UV
spectroscopic grade n-heptane and 1,4-dioxane were
used as procured from Spectrochem, India. The surfactant (AOT) was
extensively dried in vacuum desiccator for no less than 48 h. 0.01
M Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.4 was prepared in triply distilled deionized
Millipore water. All the experiments were performed with only freshly
prepared solutions maintaining a low concentration of the drugs ([drug]
= 4.0 μM) in order to ensure minimization of inner-filter effects.58 The concentrations of the drugs and DNA were
determined from respective molar absorption coefficient values (ε
= 33,000 M–1 cm–1 for PSF and
ε = 25,000 M–1 cm–1 for
SO at λ = 520 nm,22 ε = 12,858
M–1 cm–1 at λ = 260 nm for
herring sperm DNA).59,60

4.2 Instrumentation
and Methods
The absorption
and steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired on Hitachi UV–vis
U-3501 spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer LS55 fluorometer, respectively.
The time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements (lifetime and fluorescence
anisotropy measurements) were carried out by the time-correlated single
photon counting (TCSPC) method58 on a FluoroCube-01-NL
spectrometer using a laser diode (model: DD-450L-8666, typical fwhm
∼170 ps) as the light source for excitation of the samples
at λex = 450 nm. The signals were collected at the
magic angle polarization of 54.7° in order to eliminate the contribution
from fluorescence depolarization.58 Dynamic
light-scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Malvern Nano-ZS
instrument equipped with a thermostated sample chamber (Laser source:
4 mW He–Ne laser having λ = 632.8 nm, scattering angle
= 173°). Each of the fluorescence decay and fluorescence depolarization
profiles reported in this work were reproduced for four individual
measurements. Detailed description of the instrumentations and experimental
protocols/procedures is given in the Supporting Information.
