We
report the synthesis of a novel hydrazine-bridged anthranilic
acid–naphthalene conjugate (E)-2-(benzamido)-N′-((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl) methylene) benzohydrazide
(BBHAN) and its crystal structure. BBHAN can detect Al3+ by a sharp increment in fluorescence
intensity (∼40 times) in aqueous methanolic medium. The limit
of detection of BBHAN towards Al3+ is 1.68
× 10–9 M, and the former undergoes a 2:1 binding
with Al3+ with a high binding constant of ∼1.15
× 1011 M2–. BBHAN detects
Al3+ by the well-known mechanism of chelation-enhanced
fluorescence (CHEF), established by fluorescence time-resolved measurement.
The mode of interaction between BBHAN and Al3+ has been explored by 1H NMR and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry techniques. Paper strips coated with BBHAN can detect Al3+ under UV light observed through the naked
eye. Lastly, BBHAN can detect Al3+ in MDA-MB-468
cells.

1 Introduction
Aluminum
is the third most abundant element on earth’s crust
following oxygen and silicon.1,2 Due to high availability
of aluminum, it finds widespread use in preparation of cooking/storage
utensils, cosmetics as well as pharmaceutical products.3 Being a good conductor of electricity, it is
used for the manufacture of electric wires, and various electrical
and electronic appliances.4−6 This widespread use of aluminum
results in its slow consumption in the human body in its tripositive
form, resulting in many toxic effects, such as kidney damage,7 Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases,
and even cancer.8−14 Aluminum affects the absorption of calcium in bowel causing softening
of the bone and can also cause anemia by hindering the absorption
of iron in blood.15−17 At high concentrations, Al3+ is equally
detrimental to fish, algae, bacteria, and other species in aquatic
ecosystems.18−20 Due to such toxic effects exerted by Al3+, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set the upper limit for
weekly dietary intake of aluminum for human to be 7 mg/kg of body
weight.21 Hence, selective and sensitive
detection of Al3+ by cheap and convenient methods is of
utmost importance. Detection of Al3+ ion has always been
a challenging task due to the poor coordinating aptitude of the cation
along with the interference of similar-sized Zn2+ ions
during its detection.22,23 Commonly employed methods for
sensitive detection of Al3+ include atomic absorption spectrometry24 and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
(ICP–MS).25 As both processes are
expensive and time-consuming, Schiff base derivatives rich in oxygen
and nitrogen donor sites for selective fluorogenic detection of Al3+ are gaining prominence and reported in large numbers frequently.26−32 However, most of them suffer from the problems of poor detection
limit and multiple complicated synthetic steps. Thus, reports of synthetic
chemosensors that are derived from extremely cheap starting materials
and also having low detection limits are scarce. Our group has been
involved in designing sensitive optical chemosensors for detecting
various detrimental analytes. Recently, we have reported competition-free
fluorogenic detection of Al3+ by a chromone–naphthalene
conjugate up to ∼10–8 M.33 In the current work, we report yet another selective Al3+ sensor (E)-2-(benzamido)-N′-((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl) methylene) benzohydrazide (BBHAN), which is derived from anthranilic acid (AA) and 2-hydroxy naphthaldehyde (HN12). Aluminum sensors
derived from HN12 show considerably low detection limits
as well as appreciable turn-on fluorescence in the presence of Al3+.34,35 The involvement of anthranilic
acid in the metabolism of tryptophan as well as nicotinamide and its
presence in various alkaloids and plant signaling compounds, such
as 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one
(DIMBOA)36 and indole-3-acetic
acid,37,38 make it biologically interesting. This study
on BBHAN is the first report of an Al3+ sensor
constituting anthranilic acid and HN12. In aqueous methanolic
medium, it shows a ∼40 fold increment in its fluorescence intensity
in the presence of Al3+ and is completely unaffected by
similar metal ions, such as Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, etc. The detection limit for Al3+ is 5.49 nM. Such a low detection limit proves the efficacy of BBHAN, which is even 10 times lower than that in our previous
report.33BBHAN undergoes
a 2:1 binding with Al3+ as evidenced from the electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study and Job’s plot.
Moreover, BBHAN is able to detect intracellular Al3+ in MDA-MB-468 cells. For rapid assessment of Al3+, successful paper strip experiments have been performed. Lastly,
the single-crystal structure analysis of BBHAN shows
the presence of a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecule attached to the
former by hydrogen bonding. Several nonbonding interactions along
with hydrogen bonding help BBHAN attain a supramolecular
sheet. Hence, BBHAN stands out among other Schiff base
derivatives owing to the very low detection limit, multipurpose practical
utility and its unique supramolecular architecture.

2 Results and Discussion
The single crystal of BBHAN obtained was solved using
SHELXS 97, PLATON 99, ORTEP-32, and WinGX system ver 1.64.39BBHAN was synthesized by a simple
two-step reaction40,41 starting from anthranilic acid,
as depicted in Scheme 1. Both BBHAN and its Al3+ complexes were
characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), NMR, and ESI-MS
studies (Supporting Information, Figures S1–S6).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme of BBHAN
2.1 Single-Crystal X-ray Structure of BBHAN
As mentioned earlier, the novel architecture of BBHAN prompted us to grow single crystals of the same to explore its absolute
structure. Single crystals of BBHAN suitable for diffraction
were obtained from a supersaturated solution of the same in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) over a period of 1 week. Important parameters as
well as bond lengths are provided in the Supporting Information, Tables S1–S4. BBHAN crystallizes
in the P212121 space
group and its ORTEP diagram (Supporting Information, Figure S7) shows a DMSO molecule trapped within the former
by means of H-bonding interactions (Figure 1). The unit cell packing of BBHAN shows five BBHAN units and DMSO molecules in it (Supporting
Information, Figure S8). Apart from the
mentioned H-bonding between DMSO and BBHAN, the latter
shows two other hydrogen-bonding interactions, as pointed out in Figure 1. Furthermore, BBHAN undergoes nonclassical H-bonding interactions with the
trapped DMSO molecule in more than one manner and also with itself,
as depicted in Figure 2. It is due to such nonbonding interactions that BBHAN attains a weblike packing (Figure 3).

interactions observed along the b-axis.

2.2 Fluorimetric Sensing of
Al3+
As BBHAN is equipped with multiple
O and N donor sites,
we decided to check its response toward different metal ions. For
that purpose, 30 μM solutions of BBHAN in aqueous
methanol (water/methanol = 2:8, v:v) were separately treated with
1 equiv of aqueous solutions of different metals (nitrate salts were
used). When observed through the naked eye under ambient light, no
noticeable color change was observed (Figure 4). However, under UV light, the vial containing
Al3+ showed brilliant blue luminescence when observed through
the naked eye (Figure 4). This was the first hint that BBHAN could detect Al3+ through an increase in fluorescence.

Figure 4 Color of BBHAN (30 μM) treated with various
metal salts (1 equiv) under (top) ambient light and (bottom) UV light.

Following the naked eye observations,
we analyzed the absorption
profile of BBHAN in the absence and presence of various
metal ions. Bare BBHAN showed bands at ∼326, 368,
438, and 470 nm. Upon addition of metal ions, almost all metals perturbed
the absorption profile of BBHAN with Al3+ affecting
the same to the greatest extent (Supporting Information, Figure S9). Thus, UV–vis titration for
Al3+ was carried out. Upon gradual addition of Al3+, the peak at ∼470 nm diminished gradually along with the
appearance of a structured band, centered at ∼418 nm (Supporting
Information, Figure S9). However, perturbation
from different metal ions curtailed the potential of BBHAN to be a selective sensor for Al3+ as far as naked eye
color change and UV–vis response were concerned. As BBHAN contains the well-known fluorophore hydroxyl naphthaldehyde, we
checked the emission response of BBHAN in the presence
and absence of metal ions. When excited at ∼430 nm, bare BBHAN showed a weak emission profile, having an emission maximum
at ∼480 nm. Upon addition of Al3+, the emission
profile underwent a massive increment in fluorescence intensity by
a factor of ∼30 (Figure 5), which was not accomplished by addition of any other metal
ion. Even in a mixture of metal ions, an increment was observed by
20 times. Individual interference was also checked to ensure the selectivity
toward Al3+ (Supporting Information, Figure S10). Hence, BBHAN could detect Al3+ selectively by fluorescence enhancement (Figure 5). The limit of detection (Supporting
Information, Figure S11) calculated for
Al3+ was found to be 1.68 × 10–9 M based on a standard protocol.42 Such
a low detection limit proves the superiority of BBHAN as a sensitive sensor for Al3+ over other available reported
sensors (Supporting Information, Table S5).

equiv). (b) Emission titration of BBHAN (0.5 μM)
with 0–1 equiv of aqueous solution of Al3+.

2.3 Binding
Mode of Al3+ with BBHAN
To ascertain the nature
of binding of BBHAN with Al3+, 1H NMR titrations were conducted in DMSO-d6 (Figure 6). The most
noticeable change was observed for the
phenolic −OH signal, which underwent a downfield shift from
∼12.67 δ (in ppm) to ∼13.25 δ (in ppm) upon
addition of 0.5 equiv of Al3+, and finally disappearing
after addition of 1.0 equiv of Al3+. Downfield shifts were
also observed for the two amide proton signals and that of the imine,
as listed in Table S6. This indicated that
the phenolic −OH group, along with the two amide moieties and
imine, was involved in the complexation process with the Al3+ ion. The remarkable shift of the −OH signal compared to that
of the others could be understood from the strong affinity of Al3+ toward O. The involvement of imine and amide groups in the
complexation process was further confirmed through shifts in the FTIR
spectrum of BBHAN and its aluminum complex. The FTIR
spectrum of BBHAN showed signals at 1662.38 (imine) and
3399.32 (amide) cm–1, respectively, and its complex
showed signals shifted to 1605.21 (imine) and 3434.93 (amide) cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S5). The ESI-MS profile of BBHAN–Al complex
showed a signal at an m/z value
of 843.2380 (Figure 7). This could only be rationalized by considering a 2:1 complexation
pattern between BBHAN and Al3+ (m/z calculated: 843.2512). The simulated isotopic
modeling matched well with the experimental results (Supporting Information, Figure S4). To confirm this assumption, Job’s
plot was constructed for finding the stoichiometry of interaction
between BBHAN and Al3+ (Figure 8). The maxima of the plot showed an abscissa
value of ∼0.7, corresponding to a 2:1 type of interaction between BBHAN and Al3+. As Al3+ has a tendency
to form strong bonds with O donors, phenolic −OH moieties undergo
deprotonation to form strong O–Al bonds, whereas the imine
and amide moieties undergo coordinate covalent bonding with Al3+ (Scheme 2). The involvement of imine and amide moieties in the complexation
process could be understood from the shift in IR stretching frequencies.
In bare BBHAN, the amide and imine signals appeared at
3399, 3209, and 1650 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S1). In the Al3+ complex, the
signals were observed at 3434, 3231, and 1605 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S5).
The change in IR stretching frequencies is a result of covalent bonding
of the aforesaid moieties with Al3+.

Scheme 2 Mode of Complexation of BBHAN with Al3+
To find the binding constant
of BBHAN with Al3+, a modified form of Benesi–Hildebrand
method43 was employed using the following
equilibrium
equations I   II  Hence, K = k2 from eqs I and III. The BH plot (Figure 8) obtained by plotting
the reciprocals of fluorescence intensity with 1/[Al3+]1/2 showed excellent linearity (R2 = 0.98455). The binding constant obtained using the above relation
turned out to be 1.15 × 1011 M2–, which reflects the high affinity of BBHAN toward Al3+.

2.4 Mechanism of Sensing
To gain insight
into the sensing mechanism, a time-resolved fluorescence experiment
based on the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique
was conducted and the results were calculated using a standard protocol44 (Figure 9 and Table 1). Bare BBHAN shows biexponential decay with two differently
populated species having lifetime values of 50.6 ps and 2.92 ns, respectively.
However, upon addition of Al3+, a mono-exponential decay
pattern was observed, having a lifetime value of 4.28 ns. Such a massive
increment in excited-state lifetime indicates the freezing of nonradiative
channels in BBHAN after complexation with Al3+. To confirm this, the radiative (kr)
and nonradiative rate constants (knr)
were also calculated using the equations, kr = quantum yield (Φ)/average lifetime (τav) and kr + knr = 1.0.44 For this purpose, individual
quantum yields of BBHAN and the BBHAN–Al ensemble were measured using quinine sulfate dissolved in 0.05
M H2SO4 as the standard.45Table 2 enlists the values of the quantum
yield of BBHAN and its Al3+ ensemble and also
the radiative/nonradiative rate constants. The increment in the value
of radiative constant confirms the attainment of structural rigidity
in BBHAN after complexation with Al3+ (Scheme 2). Hence, the observed
turn-on response for Al3+ in BBHAN is due
to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) mechanism.46

2.5 Practical Application of
Al3+ Detection
2.5.1 Live-Cell Imaging for
Al3+
Because Al3+ sensing was achieved
in aqueous methanolic
medium, cell imaging for Al3+ was carried out using MDA-MB-468 cells. Cell survivability assay (Supporting Information, Figure S12) showed that the LD50 value
for BBHAN was ∼40 μM. So, most of the cell
population would survive at a concentration less than 40 μM.
Hence, 15 μM BBHAN was used for cell-imaging purpose.
After incubating 3 μM Al3+ in cells loaded with 15
μM BBHAN for 30 min, a prominent blue fluorescence
was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 10). The blue fluorescence thus observed was
due to complexation of Al3+ with BBHAN, which
corroborated well with the solution-phase studies. The observed fluorescence
also proved that BBHAN can well permeate through the
cell membrane within 30 min. Hence, apart from a very sensitive probe
for Al3+ in solution, BBHAN shows considerable
cell membrane permeability to detect intracellular Al3+, which increases the practical utility of BBHAN.

Figure 10 MDA-MB-468 cells observed under bright field in the
absence (a) and presence (c) of Al3+, under dark field
in the absence (b) and presence (d) of Al3+.

2.5.2 Paper Strip Test for
Al3+
As the detection of Al3+ by BBHAN was carried
out in aqueous methanolic medium, it somewhat curtailed the potential
of the latter in a pure aqueous medium. To circumvent this shortcoming,
Whatman-40 filter paper strips were coated with BBHAN (50 μM) and 2.0 μM aqueous solution of Al3+ was dropped onto it. When observed under UV light, a strong blue
fluorescence was observed (Figure 11). Thus, by successful demonstration of the paper strip
test for Al3+, solid-state detection for the same was achieved,
which adds to the merit of BBHAN as a sensitive sensor.

Al3+ (2 μM) under UV light.

3 Conclusions
We reported
the synthesis and crystal structure of an anthranilic
acid–naphthalene conjugate, BBHAN, and explored
its selective fluorimetric detection of Al3+ by enhancement
of fluorescence intensity in aqueous methanol. The limit of detection
and binding constant values are 1.68 × 10–9 M and 1.15 × 1011 M2–, respectively. BBHAN experiences the fluorescence enhancement by the CHEF
mechanism. BBHAN can detect intracellular Al3+ and also in the solid state as demonstrated by the paper strip.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
Anthranilic
acid, 2-hydroxy
naphthaldehyde, benzoyl chloride, hydrazine hydrate, and nitrate salts
of metal ions were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Triple distilled water was used for the preparation of metal solutions
and spectroscopic-grade methanol purchased from Spectrochem was used
for dissolving BBHAN.

4.2 Apparatus
Steady-state electronic
absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UV–vis
(model U-3501) spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer LS55 fluorimeter,
respectively. The time-resolved emission profile was recorded on a
Horiba JobinYvon Fluorocube-01-NL fluorimeter. IR spectra (KBr pellet,
4000–400 cm–1) were recorded on a PerkinElmer
model 883 infrared spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Advance 300 spectrometer, where chemical shifts
(δ in ppm) were determined with respect to tetramethyl silane
(TMS) as the internal standard. The single crystal of BBHAN was mounted on a Bruker-AXS SMART APEX II diffractometer equipped
with a graphite monochromator and Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
radiation. The crystal was placed 60 mm from the charge-coupled device
and 360 frames were measured with a counting time of 10 s. The structure
was solved using the Patterson method using SHELXS 97. Subsequent
difference Fourier synthesis and least-squares refinement revealed
the positions of the remaining non-hydrogen atoms. Non-hydrogen atoms
were refined with independent anisotropic displacement parameters.
Hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized positions and their displacement
parameters were fixed to be 1.2 times larger than those of the attached
non-hydrogen atoms. Successful convergence was indicated by the maximum
shift/error of 0.001 for the last cycle of the least-squares refinement.
Absorption corrections were carried out using the SADABS program.
All calculations were carried out using SHELXS 97, PLATON 99, ORTEP-32,
and WinGX system ver 1.64.39 Mass spectrum
was recorded on a Waters XevoG2-S Q TOF mass spectrometer. For cell-imaging
studies, the cell survivability assay was done by MTT assay. A microplate
reader from Biotek, and a fluorescence microscope (Leica) were used
for MTT assay and cell imaging, respectively.
