The three G-quadruplexes
involved in the human telomere have been studied with an accurate
quantum mechanical approach, and the possibility of reducing them
to a simpler model has been tested. The similarities and the differences
of these three systems are shown and discussed. Each system has been
analyzed through different properties and compared to the others.
In particular, we have considered: (1) the shape of the cavity and
the atomic charges around it; (2) the electric field in and out of
the cavity; (3) the stabilization energy due to the stacking of G-tetrads,
to the H-bonds and to the ion interactions; and, finally, (4) to study
the mechanism of the process of the ion inclusion in the cavity, the
curves of potential energy due to the movement of the Na+ and K+ ions toward the cavity. The results suggest that
a detailed study is essential in order to obtain the quantitative
properties of these complex systems, but also that some qualitative
behaviors can be schematized. Our study makes it clear that the entry
of an ion in the cavity of these systems is a complex process, where
it is possible to find stable structures with the ion out and in the
cavity. Moreover, it is possible that more than one diabatic state
is involved in this process.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
the interest in G-quadruplex systems is extremely high with thousands
of studies on specific aspects of their structure or function and
about research fields ranging from structural biology to medicinal
chemistry and from supramolecular chemistry to nanotechnology. These
systems, in fact, have been implicated in a variety of biological1,2 and nonbiological areas.3,4

Several are the
aspects of this kind of system treated in the literature. In particular,
these systems were shown to be involved in various cellular processes,
which include DNA replication, RNA transcription, and genome recombination.5,6 Moreover, these systems can also be the object of the epigenetic
phenomenon.7 Today, the most prominent
role of G-quadruplex systems in the biological area is associated
with telomere structure and function. Telomeric ends of chromosomes,
with noncoding repeated sequences of guanine-rich DNA, are fundamental
in protecting the cell from recombination and degradation. In telomeric
DNA sequences are present these four-stranded quadruplex structures
that are involved in the structure of telomere ends.8 The importance of this kind of structure is now firmly
established and well documented in the literature.9−11

G-quadruplex
is formed by consecutive G-quartets and connected loops, with the
participation of metal ions, which dwell between G-quartets and are
coordinated by several carbonyl oxygen atoms. G-quadruplexes can be
stabilized by many species of cations, such as K+, Na+, NH4+, and divalent cations (Sr2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, etc.), among which the
most physiologically relevant cations K+ and Na+ are widely noted.12−17 Monovalent cations (especially K+), placed between G-quartet
layers, have been accepted as one of the most important factor in
the stability of G-quadruplex, but little is known about its process
of binding in the human telomeric G-quadruplex. Also, the role of
water molecules in K+ binding in human telomeres has not
completely been clarified. These aspects are recently studied with
molecular dynamics (MD).18 In particular,
these authors show that metal ions regulate topologies of G-quadruplexes
through mechanisms that depend on the sizes of metal, cavities, and
hydration states; the authors of ref (19) also found that the binding of central K+ with the parallel G-quadruplex is a coordinated step-wise
process directed by water.

Several experimental techniques have
been utilized for studying G-quadruplex: dynamic light scattering,
single-crystal X-ray, electrospray mass spectrometry, circular dichroism
(CD), and solid-state NMR spectroscopic studies.20−25 In general, CD has been applied to chromophores with the main goal
of assigning the absolute configuration of chiral molecules. Because
of its sensitivity to stereochemical variations, CD has emerged to
be an important technique for studying subtle conformational changes
and supramolecular interactions in G-quadruplex systems. At present,
these systems represent biological structures that are widely investigated
with CD8,22,26,27 with an extremely high number of experimental studies
of this type. Also, the comparison28 between
duplex and G-quadruplex DNA has been characterized by CD spectroscopy
when these two kinds of systems are oxidized and the sites of oxidation
and the oxidation products are determined for these systems. The results
indicate that the nature of the secondary structure of folded DNA
greatly alters both the reactivity of these systems toward oxidative
stress as well as the product outcome. This suggests that recognition
of damage in telomeric sequences by repair enzymes may be profoundly
different in G-quadruplex from that of B-form duplex DNA. Also, the
NMR technique is an invaluable tool for the study of nucleic acid
structures and many NMR studies have been carried out on G-quadruplex
structures.20,21,29 Qualitative NMR studies also have revealed that the structures formed
by telomeric DNAs are differed according to the presence of Na+ or K+ as a counterion and the stability of these
structures depended on the monovalent cation present,30,31 too.

Several theoretical studies on these systems have been
performed but, because of the large number of atoms, a lot of these
papers investigate the structures of these systems with MD simulations32 including recent research.33−37 Recently,18 MD study has
been applied to two of the most powerful stabilizers RHPS4 and BRACO-19
of G-quadruplex systems and reveals that the central K+ has little influence on the binding conformations of the bound stabilizers,
but without the central K+, either RHPS4 or BRACO-19, cannot
stabilize the structure of G-quadruplex. In contrast to MD, quantum
mechanics (QM) approach can offer an inherently more accurate description
of G-quadruplex structures, because it can consider the polarization38−40 and, as known, it is more accurate in the treatment of hydrogen-bonding41,42 and stacking interactions.43,44 Only a few papers that
use a QM method can be found in the literature. The oldest ones are
applied to a reduced part of G-quadruplex45−50 and use Hartree–Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT)
with the B3LYP (or BLYP) functional and with 6-31G (or 6-311G) basis
set. Only in ref (51), for the first time, as underlined by the authors, accurate QM computations
(DFT-D3 with large atomic orbital basis sets) have been applied to
these systems. Recently, QM calculations on dimers of G-quartet systems
have been utilized to verify and parameterize the MD simulations,52 to study the stabilization with different cations,53 and the DFT-D3 method is applied to three-stack
models54 cutting from 2O4F and JPQ in PDB (Protein
Data Bank). The authors of this study find stronger hydrogen-bonding
and stacking interactions in the stem of the parallel G-quadruplex
(2O4F), compared
to those in the antiparallel system (JPQ). In this last paper, in
any case, the optimization has been performed only on the positions
of the hydrogen atoms, whereas all heavier atoms have been restrained
to their experimental positions. This restriction in the optimization
appears to be too strong in our view and it has been partially removed
in this paper (see later).

In this paper, we will use a reliable
quantum mechanical approach in order to compute some properties of
the three different G-quadruplexes of the human telomere. In this
context, “reliable” means that our approach is able
to consider with the same accuracy both the hydrogen-bond interaction
between the bases and the π–π interactions between
the G-quartets. In this study, the fundamental properties of atomic
charges, electric field, molecular structures, and energies of these
systems are computed and analyzed. Two novelties of this paper must
be underlined. First of all, for the first time, three complete G-quadruplex
structures have been studied with a reliable quantum mechanical approach,
while until now only had been studied parts of these systems; second,
when we have utilized reduced systems we have tested their applicability
to the specific properties considered. Moreover, in this paper, also
the influence of water solvent and the optimization of the experimental
structures are taken into consideration and discussed.

2 Systems Studied and Computational Method
In this paper,
we are studying three different G-quadruplex structures of the human
telomere: (a) the hybrid 155 (2HY9 code in PDB, model
1), (b) the hybrid 256 (2JPZ code, model 1),
and (c) the basket-type57 (2KF8 code), where, in
the last case, only two G-quartet layers are present. Recently, the
two polymorphic hybrid 1 and hybrid 2 conformers have been discriminated
by a fluorescence study.58 From now on,
we will be using the notation Form 1, Form 2, and Form 3 for these
three G-quadruplex systems as in ref (57). The Form 1 and Form 2 systems have 843 atoms
(these two hybrid structures are different in the order of their loop
orientations), while the Form 3 structure has 715 atoms. Figure 1 shows schematically
these systems while Figure SI_1–3 in the Supporting Information shows them in wireframe modality. These
G-quadruplex systems have been identified experimentally. In particular,
in KCl solution, experiments have before identified two similar folding
motifs referred to as hybrid 1 and hybrid 259−62 and after the Form 3 that, despite
the presence of only two G-tetrads in the core, it is more stable
than the three-G-tetrad G-quadruplexes previously observed for human
telomeric sequences in K+ solution. Recently,63 quadruplex structures of a human telomere, stabilized
by sodium and potassium ions, have been studied by using surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. In the SERS spectra, the bands
typical of the basket-type and the mixed hybrid structures were identified
and assigned. Moreover, a recent thermodynamic study19 revealed that Na+ stabilized basket-like G-quadruplex.
This paper revealed that metal ions selectively stabilize G-quadruplex
topologies with a specific cavity of a certain size and also studied
the role of the hydration states in this stabilization. The polymorphism
present in the G-quadruplexes cannot be avoided in this study, because
also in the experiments on the human telomeres the coexistence of
these conformers has been found.56,57,60,62,64−66

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the three G-quadruplex systems.

In our paper, all these G-quadruplex
systems are studied with and without hydration (in the polarizable
continuum model (PCM) approach); what is more, the reduced dimeric models (where only
the two up G-tetrads of the three G-tetrads are extracted from the 2HY9 and 2JPZ structures with
the backbones between their, as in ref (67). Similarly, the two G-tetrads and their backbones
are extracted from the 2KF8 structure) of these three systems have been considered
after these models have been tested and have reproduced a selection
of G-quadruplex properties. Also, in the dimer cases, the hydration
has been considered. The dimers extracted from the G-quadruplex systems
have 244 atoms and have been studied with and without the inclusion
of ions (K+, but in a case also Na+). No atoms
(hydrogens or cations) are added near the phosphate groups, as in
ref (51).

In
the study of dimer systems, the initial geometry extracted from the
G-quadruplex of the PDB has been partially optimized with respect
to our basis set. In particular, we have optimized only the two G-quartets
of these systems and kept fixed the position of the backbones according
to those of the experimental data. At this point, we would like to
stress that the authors of ref (54) have optimized only the hydrogen atoms from the structures
extracted from the PDB. In our opinion, this type of optimization
is not sufficient because the changing of the quadruplex cavity is
essential in the study of the ion inclusion. Two are the reasons for
our partial optimization. First, because of the presence of 244 atoms,
is that the convergence of the full optimization is not easy to reach,
and second, is that, during the full optimization, these calculations
may be easily trapped in local minima, as highlighted in the literature.52

We have already demonstrated in our previous
paper67 on the G-quadruplex that the results
obtained with a partial optimization (where only the positions of
the atoms of guanines are optimized) are very similar to that of the
full optimization. Also, in the cases studied here, we have performed
this test on these reduced models and we have reached the same conclusion
(result not reported in the paper). In order to understand the approach
of the ion (K+ or Na+) to the cavity of these
systems, we have studied the potential energy surface (PES), as a
function of the ion position, in one of these dimers, the one extracted
from the Form 3. Also, the inclusion of a water molecule in the cavity
and the presence of it when the ion arrives have been studied in the
case with K+ ion.

As in our previous paper on G-quadruplex67 and in some of our studies on the Watson–Crick
base of DNA,68−71 this theoretical investigation has been performed with the Gaussian
package72 using DFT with the M06-2X73 functional of Thrular in the cc-pVDZ basis set.
For the cations studied, this basis set is not present in the Gaussian
program so that we have used the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. As already
explained,67 the choice of the M06-2X functional
for the DFT approach is motivated by the hope of describing both the
hydrogen-bond interaction between the bases and the π–π
interactions between the G-quartets. It is well known74,75 that an acceptable description of these two kinds (hydrogen bond
and π–π) of nonbonding interactions needs a good
calculation of the dispersion term45,51 or the use
of the M06-2X functional. This functional, in fact, is probably the
most accurate dispersion-uncorrected functional that is able to give
good results for the stacked structures76,77 because it
contains a reasonable description of dispersion in the medium range
(low but finite density regions)78 of distances.

In any case, we have also computed the empirical correction of
the basis set due to the dispersion energy, for the systems studied.
We found that this correction does not affect the optimized geometry
and the atomic charges, but it is important in the calculation of
the stacking and hydrogen-bond stabilization. Hence, we use this correction
in the calculations of these interaction energies. We have also used
the counterpoise correction of energy. The basis set superposition
error (BSSE) is a consequence of the finite basis set and is due to
the superposition of the basis sets of the different fragments of
the system. The absolute value of this correction is quite large (about
20 kcal/mol), but practically irrelevant in the computation of potential
energy curves, where the different values are due to a change of only
the position of one atom. Also, this correction is used in the calculation
of interaction energies.

3 Results and Discussion
Three are the main properties studied in this paper. First of all,
we have computed the atomic natural bond orbital (NBO,79 where we remember that NBOs are generally localized
2-center orbitals that describe the Lewis-like molecular bonding pattern
of electron pairs in optimally compact form) charges of the systems
of Figure 1 and of
the dimers extracted from them. In this paper, we will show only the
atomic charges of the atoms around the cavity and those of the atoms
involved in the hydrogen bridge (H-bridge), in particular. The remaining
atomic charges can be found in the Supporting Information. Second, we have investigated the electric field
of these systems and investigated the entry of the ion in their cavity.
In the cases studied, the role of hydration has been included and
analyzed. Finally, for a dimer (that one extracted from the basket-like
system), we have computed the potential energy curve as a function
of the position of the K+ or Na+ ions and a
water molecule respect to the center of the cavity in the system where
the positions of the atoms of the G-quartets have been optimized.

In Figures 2–4 [case (a) G-quadruplex and (b)
corresponding dimer], we are showing the shape of this cavity, the
charges of the main atoms involved in the cage and the hydrogen bond
distances for the Form 1 (Figure 2), Form 2 (Figure 3), and Form 3 (Figure 4), respectively. In Figure SI_5-7, the same results are shown for the identical systems (no new optimization)
of Figures 2–4 but in the presence of hydration in PCM model.
Some considerations can be done from the analysis of Figures 2–4 and SI_5-7.(1) Each system has
a particular cavity shape that is not largely modified in the dimer
after the partial optimization. We underline that in the cases of
dimers we have performed an optimization of the geometry of the eight
guanines with the constraint of experimental geometry of the backbones.

(2) The H-bridges of both
G-quadruplexes and dimers show a large negative charge on the heavy
atoms and a positive charge on the hydrogen, with the larger charge
on the N atom.

(3) The
hydration changes the NBO charges of the atoms involved in the H-bridges.
In particular,
the hydration generally makes the negative charge of the oxygen atom
to increase and decrease that of N atom, while the positive charge
of the H atom in some cases increases while in other cases decreases.
In general, the hydration makes the global charges of the atoms involved
in the H-bridges to increase, with a variation of the charge larger
for the oxygen than for the H and N atoms.

(4) The H-bond distances can vary greatly as a consequence
of the optimization of the guanine, until 0.58 Å. Generally,
there is a decrease of the H-bond distance in the optimized dimer
and, hence, a stronger H-bond, but there are also some H-bond distances
that are increased when the optimization of the guanines positions
are performed.

(5) After
the optimization of the guanine positions in the dimer, the charges
of the atoms involved in the H-bridges are larger. In the cases studied,
the larger variation is that of the oxygen atom.

(6) In the comparison among the different
G-quadruplex structures, we would like to underline some similarities
and differences.

(a) There
is a similar global charge in the cavity of the three G-quadruplex
structures; in particular, the global negative and positive charges
in the cavity of Form 1 and Form 2 are practically identical and those
of Form 3 slightly larger (this is true for both negative and positive
global charges).

(b) The
order of the average H-bond distance is Form 1 > Form 2 > Form
3 in the G-quadruplexes, but in the dimers this average distance is
similar in the three cases.

(c) In order to compare the G-quadruplex and the corresponding dimer
of the three systems, in Table 1 we show the order of the difference between the dimer and
the corresponding G-quadruplex for some properties. In particular,
we show the variations of the H-bond average distance and those of
the atomic charges of the atoms involved in the H-bridges with and
without hydration. Here, it is important to point out that the variations
of the atomic charges around the cavity for the three hydrated systems
follow the same order: Form 2 > Form 1 > Form 3.

and distances are in bold characters.

In Figures 5–7 are shown the cavity shapes with the main atomic charges
and distances of the dimers extracted from the three G-quadruplex
systems, when a K+ ion (placed at the center of these systems)
is included in the optimization (a) without and (b) with water solvent.
The comparison between the dimers with and without a K+ ion shows that this ion lengthens, and hence weakens, the H-bonds
of these systems, while the modification of the shape of cavity is
not large. Otherwise, the hydration of these systems has specific
effects on the charges of each structure; in particular:(a) The Form 1 has an
increase of the negative charge of the oxygen and a decrease of that
of the nitrogen, while the hydrogen charge varies in non-uniform way.
The effect on the oxygen is larger, in any case.

(b) The Form 2 shows the larger variation
of the charges compared with the other structures, but in this case
both the oxygen and the nitrogen atoms can increase or decrease their
negative charge.

(c) The
Form 3 has a similar variation of charge than Form 1, with the charge
of the oxygen that can increase or decrease while that of the nitrogen
and hydrogen has small variations.

cavity, NBO atomic charges, and H-bond lengths of (a) 2HY9 + K+ dimer
and (b) corresponding hydrated (water in PCM) dimer. The hydrogen
bond distances (Å) are indicated. The atoms in yellow are in
the up plane where the charges and distances are in bold characters.

dimer.

Figure 7 As Figure 5, (a) 2KF8 + K+ dimer and (b) corresponding hydrated (water in PCM)
dimer.

The charge of the K+ ion in the cavity of the dimers is 0.623, 0.619, and 0.648 in the
Form 1, Form 2, and Form 3 (and 0.624, 0.622, and 0.653 in the hydrated
systems), respectively, and it is smaller of the initial +1 of the
ion in any case, with a fraction of electron (in the range 0.35–0.4)
that moves from the dimer to the ion. Because even the atoms involved
in the H-bonds are more negative in the presence of the K+ ion, the interaction of this cation with these dimer systems causes
in all cases a movement of a fraction of electron toward the cavity.
At our knowledge, this effect is never underlined in the literature.
Finally, these dimers show eight different bonds (with a bond distance
in the range 2.59–3.02 Å) between the central K+ ion and the oxygen atoms of the cavity. These K–O bonds are
of different lengths and strengths, and also, this asymmetry has never
been underlined in the literature before.

In Table 2, we show the energy stabilization
of the dimers (with and without a K+ ion) due to the stacking
interaction and to the H-bonds. All of these results have been obtained
with the inclusion of the BSSE correction and the empirical D3 correction
on the M062X functional.

a Stabilization energies in kcal/mol. Both the energies of H-bond and
O–K+ interaction are average value. Remember that
in the dimer system, there are 16 H-bonds and 8 O–K+ interactions.

From the
analysis of Table 2, we can see that:(a) The stablest system is that of Form 1, while the other
two systems have similar stabilization energy.

(b) The stacking energy is smaller than
the H-bonds energy (in the Table 2, we have shown the average energy of one H-bond, but
in the dimeric system there are 16 bonds) and of the O–K+ interaction (eight interactions).

(c) The addition of a K+ ion decreases
the stacking energy (due to steric effect) but increases the H-bond
stabilization (and forms eight interactions between the oxygen atom
and the K+ ion).



In Figure 8 it is shown the
electric field in the cavity of the three G-quadruplexes and in that
of the corresponding dimers with the K+ ion in the center.
The Cartesian axes of these systems are shown in Figure SI_1–3. In Figure 8, the positive part of the field is plotted
in black and the negative part in green. It is evident that the electric
field in the cavity of the G-quadruplex is, in all cases, completely
negative without the ion. When the K+ ion is added, instead,
there are positive and negative parts of the electric field in the
cavity and only the 2FK8 system has a cavity with an electric field completely positive.

left to right) and of the corresponding dimers (from the top to bottom)
with K+ ion in the center of the cavity. In green, the
negative part of the field; in black, the positive one. The cavity
has been explored in the range from −2 to 2 Å from the
center in the directions between the G-quartets (x-axis) and perpendicular (y-axis) to them (see Figure SI_1–3 for the Cartesian axes).

As already pointed out, only in
the example case of the Form 3, we have studied the potential energy
curve due to the movement of the Na+ and K+ ions
toward the cavity of the dimer extracted from this quadruplex. In
these calculations, the geometry of the cavity has been optimized
for each position of the ion because, without this optimization, there
would have been a too large barrier for the entry of the ion in the
cavity (see Figure 15a,b, in ref (67), for an example). In these cases, the ion approaches
the cavity from the upper plane, as suggested by simulation studies.80,81 We remember that the two G-quartet planes of the dimer are non-equal
because this structure is extracted from the quadruplexes (Form 3)
where it is evident that an upper plane is different from a lower
one.

In Figure 9a, there is the PES, as a function of the position respect to the
center of the cavity, of: Na+ (black curve), H2O case (red curve), and H2O and water solvent in the PCM
method (blue curve). In Figure 9b are shown the PES of K+ (black curve), K+ with hydration (red curve), and K+ when an explicit
molecule of water is present in the cavity and it is kicked out by
the ion (blue curve). In Figure 9a it is evident that the Na+ ion comes into
the cavity without a barrier because no other stable position exists
out of the cavity in this case. The case with a molecule of water
has been studied for analyzing the possibility that the cavity is
not empty when the ion arrives, as considered in the Figure 9b. In this last case, it is
evident that only the hydrated water molecule has a reasonable energy
barrier for entering the cavity of this system. From the comparison
between the Figure 9a,b, the preference of the 2KF8 G-quadruplex for the Na+ ion appears evident,
as found in the experimental studies.64 In all cases of Figure 9b, the existence of two kinds of minima is evident (and, hence,
of stable structures), one with K+ in the cavity (the stablest
one) and the other with K+ outside the cavity. In particular,
in the case of K+ + H2O, there are two stable
positions outside the cavity, and in the case of K+, a
minimum outside and another one around the up plane of guanine (we
want to remember that the two plane of guanine are around −1.5
and 1.5 Å). The barriers for the entry of the K+ ion
in the three cases of Figure 9b are different, but only in the case where the K+ ion is alone (black curve), there is a practically null barrier.

center of the cavity; X = Na+, H2O, and H2O hydrated in (a) and K+ ion in (b). In figure
(b) K-H2O means that a molecule of water is initially present
in the center of the cavity, but then its position is optimized when
the K+ ion moves toward the cavity. In figure (b), different
areas are highlighted (see text).

3.1 Different Areas Are Highlighted (See Text)
All curves of potential energy of Figure 9b can be seen as formed from more than one
diabatic state. This behavior can be also highlighted by plotting
the charges of the atoms involved in the H-bridges as a function of
the different position of K+ ion.

In Figures 10–12, we are showing the variations of the
average charge of the O (Figure 10), H (Figure 11), and N (Figure 12) atoms involved in the H-bridges around the cavity. By comparing Figures 9b and 10–12, it appears evident that a correspondence can be found between
the change in the behavior of the potential energy curves and those
of these average atomic charges. We believe that this correspondence
represents an evidence of the nature of the interaction between the
atoms of the cavity and the K+ ion, and it can be rationalized
with different diabatic states involved in this complex process. At
your knowledge, it is the first time that the entry of a K+ ion into the cavity of a G-quadruplex has been schematized as a
complex process that involved some different minima and a multiplicity
of diabatic states.

4 Conclusions
In this paper we have studied
with a reliable quantum mechanical approach the three G-quadruplexes
involved in the human telomere. It is a first time that a complete
theoretical analysis of this very important biological system has
been performed at this level of calculation. The general conclusion
that can be drawn from this study is that these three systems are
similar according to some characteristics and different in others.
The first statement explains the similar behavior of these systems
and the possibility of a transformation of each other when the conditions
of the environment change. This analysis has also highlighted some
differences in the properties of these systems: the shape of cavity,
the atomic charges, the global electric field, the H-bonds, and the
preference for an ion or another. Hence, the results of these calculations
provide also an answer to the specificity of each structure.

Finally, we would like to highlight some general consideration that
can be obtained from this paper.1. The global atomic charges of the atoms
involved in the H-bonds around the cavity are substantially equal
in the three G-quadruplexes. Nevertheless, the strength of the H-bonds
is quite different in these three G-quadruplexes. This different behavior
of the charge and the strength of the H-bonds points out that the
H-bond has certainly an important ionic component, but this is flanked
from other quantum mechanical aspects. The interaction of the cavity
of the G-quadruplexes with the ion and the water, and the environment
in general, can be understood with the help of these atomic charges,
but also the variation of the strength of the H-bonds must be considered
for this respect.

2. Generally
speaking, the hydration makes the global charges of the atoms involved
in the H-bridges to increase with a larger variation of the charge
of the oxygen then for the H and N atoms. The introduction of the
water solvent, also in a simple model such as the PCM one, is important
for moving the system studied from the ideal case to the real one
present in the cell.

3. By the analysis of the results of this paper, we can state that it
is possible to reduce the G-quadruplex systems to a simpler model,
as a dimer, mainly for the properties localized in the cavity or around
the cavity. This approximation is largely applied in the literature,
but it has been tested only by us, in ref (67) and in this paper. In the dimer models, in any
case, the optimization of the G-quartet parts is essential and sufficient.
This optimization has as a consequence the increase of the atomic
charges of the atoms involved in the H-bridges around the cavity and
of the H-bonds strength. This optimization is not used in general
in the literature, as demonstrated in ref (54).

4. The addition of a K+ ion to the dimers changes some of
their properties: (1) weakens the bonds H around the cavity, (2) generates
a small modification of the shape of the cavity, (3) changes the atomic
charges, and (4) forms a strong interaction between the ion and the
oxygen atoms of the cavity. In any case, the addition of the ion stabilizes
the quadruplex systems because the weakening of the H-bonds is compensated
by the formation of the bonds between the ion and the oxygen atoms
of the cavity. In fact, these systems shows eight bonds between the
central K+ ion and the oxygen atoms of the cavity, different
from each other, but this difference has never been underlined and
considered in the literature. Important to emphasize is also the change
of the atomic charges around the cavity. In all cases studied, a fraction
of about 0.4 electron moves from the dimer to the ion and, because
even the atoms involved in the H-bridges become more negative in the
presence of the K+ ion, there is also an additional movement
of a fraction of electron toward the cavity. Otherwise, the hydration
of these systems with the ion has different effects on the charges
of each specific structure.

5. The electric field in the cavity of the G-quadruplex is in all
cases studied negative without the ion. When the ion is added, positive
and negative electric field in different parts of the cavity can be
found and only the 2FK8 system has a cavity with an electric field practically completely
positive.

6. The stabilization
energy of these systems is due primary to the H-bonds network, second
to the ion interaction with the oxygen atoms and, finally, to the
stacking between the G-quartets.

7. The entry of an ion into the cavity can be a complex
process where it is possible to find stable structures with the ion
outside or inside the cavity. In some case, it is possible that more
than one diabatic state is involved in this process. We have studied
the potential energy curves due to the movement of the Na+ and K+ ions and also of a water molecule toward the cavity
of the dimer extracted from Form 3 of quadruplex. These curves are
able to explain the preference of the basket-like G-quadruplex (2KF8) for the Na+ ion compared with the K+ one and also show the
presence of a not-too-large barrier for the entry of K+ even if in the cavity there is already a water molecule. In the
case of K+ ion, the curve suggests that more diabatic states
are involved in the process.



As a conclusion,
we underline that the results of this paper can help in the understanding
of the behavior of the quadruplex systems of the human telomere, but
this aim can only be obtained by accurate theoretical calculations.
Of course, a QM approach to these complex systems can work only on
a modelization of the real condition in the cell, and hence, the theoretical
results must be integrated with experimental results in order to operate
in the biological context.
