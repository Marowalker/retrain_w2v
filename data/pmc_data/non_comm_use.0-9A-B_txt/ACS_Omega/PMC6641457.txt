Two stable nitronyl nitroxide free
radicals {R1 = 4′-methoxy-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide
(NNPhOMe) and R2 = 2-(2′-thienyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline
3-oxide 1-oxyl (NNT)} are successfully synthesized using Ullmann condensation.
The reactions of these two radicals with 3d transition metal ions,
in the form of M(hfac)2 (where M = Co or Mn, hfac: hexafluoroacetylacetone),
result in four metal–organic complexes Co(hfac)2(NNPhOMe)2, 1; Co(hfac)2(NNT)2·(H2O), 2; Mn(hfac)2(NNPhOMe)·x(C7H16), 3; and Mn(hfac)2(NNT)2, 4. The crystal structure and magnetic properties of these complexes
are investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, dc magnetization,
infrared, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. The
compounds 1 and 4 crystallize in the triclinic, P1̅, space group, whereas complex 3 crystallizes
in the monoclinic structure with the C2/c space group and forms chain-like structure along the c direction. The complex 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic
symmetry with the P21/c space group in which the N–O unit of the radical coordinates
with the Co ion through hydrogen bonding of a water molecule. All
compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions between the transition
metal ions and nitronyl nitroxide radicals. The magnetic exchange
interactions (J/KB) are
derived using isotropic spin Hamiltonian H = −2J∑(SmetalSradical) for the model fitting to the magnetic susceptibility
data for 1, 2, 3, and 4. The exchange interaction strengths are found to be −328,
−1.25, −248, and −256 K, for the 1, 2, 3, and 4 metal–organic
complexes, respectively. Quantum chemical density functional theory
(DFT) computations are carried out on several models of the metal–radical
complexes to elucidate the magnetic interactions at the molecular
level. The calculations show that a small part of the inorganic spins
are delocalized over the oxygens from hfac {∼0.03 for Co(II)
and ∼0.015 for Mn(II)}, whereas a more significant fraction
{∼0.24 for Mn(II) and ∼0.13 for Co(II)} of delocalized
spins from the metal ion is transferred to the coordinated oxygen
atom(s) of nitronyl nitroxide.

1 Introduction
The synthesis and development of organic-molecule and organometallic-based
magnetic materials are of great interest to current research because
of their possible technological applications in recording, quantum
computing, molecular spintronics, and high-density data storage.1−3 Moreover, these materials are lightweight and flexible, therefore,
could preferably be useful in miniaturization of electronic devices.
Many magnetic materials in the form of single-molecular magnets4,5 and single chain magnets6 have been synthesized
in recent years using various approaches. One of the most successful
methods is the coordination of a spin-active transition metal ion
to stable ligands under “metal–radical” synthesis.7 The advantage of this approach over others is
that it could yield a variety of molecular structures with different
magnetic dimensionalities and with unusual magnetic properties. The
magnetic interactions in such systems can be rationalized by the degree
of overlap or orthogonality of the spin-active orbitals of the organic
radicals with those of the metal ions. However, the suitable choice
of transition metal ions and ligands could be another important criterion
for achieving the desired magnetic dimensionality. For example, the
compounds synthesized using nitronyl nitroxides, imino nitroxides,
and butyl nitroxide ligands with metal ions {metal(II) bis-hexafluoroacetylacetonate}
form chains (1-D), layers (2-D), and bulk networks (3-D). In this
regard, we have synthesized molecule-based magnets of Prussian blue
analogues, chain molecular magnets, and single-molecule magnets using
coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods.8−12

Recently, the nitronyl nitroxide-based radicals
have received much
attention after being used successfully implemented as potential building
blocks for molecular magnetic materials.13 Nitronyl nitroxide is a free stable radical, which offers many advantages,14 such as: (i) it can act as a bridging ligand
with a spin center as it has one unpaired electron delocalized over
the coordinating O atom, and antibonding π* orbitals in the
plane O–N–C–N–O, and (ii) the radical
can coordinate with suitable metal ions as a bis-monodentate bridging
ligand or as a monodentate ligand, resulting in interesting heterospin
systems, that is, hybrid complexation of different metal ions with
stable free radicals. Moreover, by tailoring the intermolecular spin–spin
interaction of the nitronyl nitroxide radical (varying intermolecular
arrangements), the magnetic exchange between the magnetic orbital
of the transition metal and that of the coordinating nitronyl nitroxide
radical can be rationalized. Such a control can be effectuated by
varying the molecular fragment (R) to which the nitronyl nitroxide
radical is attached. Moreover, the properties of the R-group (R may
stand for the ancillary functional group) linked to the nitronyl nitroxide
ligands not only influence the intermolecular spin–spin interactions
but also affect the coordination mode of the nitronyl nitroxides with
metal ions, thus resulting in change of the magnetic properties of
the metal–radical complexes. In addition, a slight modification
in the synthesis processes could also result in a different dimensionality
of the crystal structures and, hence, of the magnetic properties.

Moreover, nitronyl nitroxide-based compounds have been of great
interest because of their interesting structural and magnetic properties.
The large amount of work on such complexes have been carried out in
the past by the group of Gatteschi and his co-workers.15−21 The various networks using 3d metal ions such as cobalt(II), nickel(II),
manganese(II), copper(II), and so forth and nitronyl nitroxide radicals
have been extensively studied. Apart from the 3d metal ions, many
other rare earth/4f/5f-based metal ions have also been investigated
for structural and magnetic properties.22−30 The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the magnetic properties
in terms of magnetic interactions have also been investigated using
inelastic neutron scattering, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy and magnetization measurements. The useful information
on the nature of the exchange interaction and anisotropy, particularly,
in the case of one-dimensional Co-based chain compound, had been estimated
for designing new molecular magnetic materials with higher blocking
temperatures. The exchange interactions between the nitronyl nitroxide
radical and Cu metal ions have been extensively investigated by Fedin
and co-workers using temperature-dependent EPR for the Cu(hfac)2LR compound.31−36 The results could explain the possible models for phase transitions
in Cu(hfac)2LR complexes at the molecular level.
In this regard, various nitronyl nitroxide-based metal complexes with
different coordination species, such as pyridyl, bipyridyl, 2-(4-quinolyl)
nitronyl nitroxide, and so forth, have been previously obtained. For
example, four metal–radical complexes based on NNpPy{2-(4-pyridyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxyl-3-oxide} have recently been synthesized
with weak antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic interactions and J/KB in the range of 9.7 to
−0.32 K.37 Similarly, metal complexation
reactions of N-t-butyl-N-oxidanyl-2-amino (nitronyl nitroxide) diradical with M(hfac)2 (M = Mn or Cu and hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetone) have lately
been reported with a strong antiferromagnetic interaction (J/KB = −217 K) between
the Mn(II) spin (S = 5/2) and the diradical (S = 1).38 A metal–radical
complex using 2,6-NNPy {2,6-bis(3′-oxide-1′-oxyl-4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethylimidazolin-2′-yl)
pyridine} coordinated to Cu(II) has been synthesized.39 The ferromagnetic interaction between the axial radical
and the copper center (JCu-rad/KB ≈ 10 K) has been observed, whereas
strong antiferromagnetic coupling (JCu–rad ≈ −460 K) between this metal ion and the equatorial
nitroxide groups has taken place.39 Similarly,
the metal complexes made using 2-(4-quinolyl)nitronyl nitroxide (4-QNNN)
and M(hfac)2 [M = Mn(II), Co(II), and Cu(II)] exhibit a
1-D alternating chain in which the metal and the radical are antiferromagnetically
coupled, with a magnetic exchange constant of J/KB = −1.2 K.40

Not only 3d metal complexes have been synthesized, a series
of
heterospin complexes based on lanthanides and pyridine biradicals
have also been prepared. Some of them are found to show antiferromagnetic
interactions between the paramagnetic ions {Ln(III) and radicals},
whereas some other compounds demonstrate ferromagnetic coupling.41 One example of nitronyl nitroxide free radical
2-(2-pyridyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-oxide
(NN2Py) complexed with Tb has a slow relaxation of magnetization at
low temperatures, exhibiting a single-molecule magnetic behavior.42

However, detailed studies in terms of
experimental and theoretical
investigations of magnetic properties of such metal complexes are
limited. Moreover, it is very interesting and desirable to understand
their magnetic properties by varying their spin characteristics. In
this paper, we report synthesis and crystal structures and magnetic
properties of two nitronyl nitroxide radicals {R1 = 4′-methoxy-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide
(NNPhOMe) and R2 = 2-(2′-thienyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline
3-oxide 1-oxyl (NNT)}-based four metal complexes. The theoretical
analysis of magnetic properties using density functional theory (DFT),
quantum chemistry, thermodynamic calculations, and so forth is commonly
used for calculating the exchange interactions and exchange-coupling
constant.43−50 Different computational methods have been employed to elucidate
the mechanism of spin–spin interaction, the magnitude of effective
exchange integrals, and the nature of the participating spin-active
MOs.46,47 The influence of the used basis set was
emphasized in some of the studies. The model systems were excerpts
from various experimentally obtained nitronyl nitroxide-based complexes
with transition metal ions, which contained or did not contain unpaired
electrons. In relation to the applicability of DFT to assess the magnetic
interactions in the studied complexes, this is still one of the most
widely applied computational techniques.51,52 However, it may not be the most accurate one, but when it is carefully
applied, DFT should provide a good balance in the description of both
the inorganic and the organic spin. An additional reason to use this
approach is that it enables simulation of larger model systems. In
our case, the mechanism of the spin–spin interaction depends
essentially on the spin polarization along the entire organic radical,
and hence, DFT is computationally more feasible than, for example,
CASSCF-based methods. Therefore, density functional calculations on
model units of the complexes are used to supplement the experimental
results with microscopic insights into the magnetic exchange interactions,
namely, the relative stability of the spin states is explained with
spin density distribution and delocalization over the organic radicals
and with the overlap present in the singly occupied molecular orbitals
(SOMOs).

2 Synthesis Scheme of Radicals and Metal Complexes
Two nitronyl nitroxide radicals (R1 and R2) are synthesized
by double condensation of 3-bis (hydroxyamino)-2,3-dimethylbutane·H2SO4 (BHA·H2SO4) with
the corresponding aldehydes and subsequent oxidation of the condensation
product (N,N′-dihydroxy imidazoline)
with sodium periodate in a biphasic medium, following the method described
as Ullmann condensation.53 Subsequently,
four metal–radical complexes are obtained using these two radicals
as shown in Scheme 1.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Crystal
Structure Analysis
The X-ray
crystallographic analysis revealed that the metal–radical complex 1 crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system with space
group P1̅ and Z = 2, as shown
in Figure 1. The Co(II)
is coordinated to two oxygen atoms (O11 and O46) of the two nitronyl
nitroxide radicals and to four oxygen atoms (O20, O24, O60, and O64)
of the auxiliary compound (hfac) molecule forming a distorted octahedral
structure. The bond distances between the Co and two O atoms of the
radicals are found to be different. The longer Co(1)–O(11)
distance is found to be ∼2.1082(15) Å, whereas the shorter
distance Co(1)–O(46) is found to be ∼2.0527(14)Å.
These bond lengths are comparable to the reported cobalt(II) nitronyl
nitroxide complexes. The bond angles O(60)–Co(1)–O(20),
O(46)–Co(1)–O(64), and O(24)–Co(1)–O(11)
are found to be ∼163.29(6), 173.77(6), and 173.80(6)°,
respectively. The results from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
are given in Table 1, and characteristic bond lengths and bond angles of the complexes
are summarized in Table 2.

The metal–radical complex 2 crystallizes
in
the monoclinic symmetry with space group P21/c and Z = 4 (Figure 2). It is interesting to note
that the Co metal ion is not coordinated with the nitronyl nitroxide
ligand in complex 2 as metal and ligands are separated
from each other as shown in Figure 2. However, Co(II) is connected to two oxygen atoms
of the two water molecules and four oxygen atoms of the auxiliary
compound (hfac) molecule forming a distorted octahedral structure.
The distances between Co and two water O atoms of the water molecule
are found to be ∼2.097 and 2.094 Å, respectively. The
average bond length of Co–O is ∼2.0 Å, whereas
the bond angles O(34)–Co(1)–O(25) and O(21)–Co(1)–O(38)
are found to be ∼178.29(7) and 174.48(9)°, respectively.
Because the Co(II) ion is six-coordinated by four oxygen atoms from
two hfac ions and two oxygen atoms from two H2O molecules,
the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are found in the crystal of complex 2. The molecular arrangement of complex 2 is
shown in Figure 2b–d.
The hydrogen bonding interactions occur between two oxygen atoms from
one coordinated water molecule and one uncoordinated nitronyl nitroxide.
As a result, molecules are linked by weak interactions to form a chain-like
structure as depicted in Figure 2.

structure as shown along different viewing directions in (b–d).
Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity of presentation.

The metal–radical complex 3 forms a linear
chain-like structure (shown in Figure 3), which crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and Z = 8. The chain
lies along the C axis, in which the Mn(II) metal
ions are connected to two oxygen atoms of the two nitronyl nitroxide
radicals and four oxygen atoms of the auxiliary compound (hfac) molecule
in a distorted octahedral structure. The heptane molecule is also
present in the crystal. The shortest intra and interchain Mn–Mn
distances are found to be ∼12.05 and 26.13 Å, respectively.
There are four chains per unit cell in the compound. The average bond
length of the Mn–O bond is ∼2.1 Å. The bond angles
O(11)–Mn(1)–O(34), O(38)–Mn(1)–O(20),
and O(6)–Mn(1)–O(24) are found to be ∼166.02(12),
156.29(11), and 169.54(12)°, respectively.

The metal–radical complex 4 crystallizes
in the triclinic crystal structure with
space group P1̅ and Z = 2.
The Mn(II) metal ions are connected to two oxygen atoms of the two
nitronyl nitroxide radicals and four oxygen atoms of the auxiliary
compound (hfac) molecule in a distorted octahedral structure. The
average bond length of the Mn–O bond is found to be ∼2.100
Å. The average bond lengths of the bonds Mn(1)–O(6) and
Mn(1)–O(61) are found to be ∼2.125(16) and 2.129(15)
Å, respectively. The bond angles of O(6)–Mn(1)–O(21),
O(21)–Mn(1)–O(34), and O(61)–Mn(1)–O(25)
are found to be ∼101.15(7), 168.88(6), and 169.48(6)°,
respectively (Figure 4).

3.2 EPR Study
The
X-band EPR spectra
of the randomly oriented crystals of the metal complexes and radicals
are shown in Figure 5. The insets of Figure 5a,b show the EPR spectra of the radicals R1 and R2, respectively.
The radical R1 shows a single
symmetric line at room temperature, with a peak-to-peak line width
ΔBpp ≈ 1.32 mT. The value of g can be
calculated from ν (in GHz) and B0 (in gauss) using
the following equation 1  where h is the Planck’s
constant, β is a conversion constant called the Bohr magneton,
ν is the frequency, and B0 is the
magnetic field. The measured average g-value is ∼2.0065
for R1. A single asymmetric line
at room temperature, with a peak-to-peak line width ΔBpp ≈
1.81 mT is observed for complex 1 at room temperature.
It is therefore evident that after the synthesis of metal radical
complexes, the peak-to-peak line width, ΔBpp, increases. The
measured average g-value is found to be ∼2.0009
and ∼2.0002 for 1 and 2, respectively.
In the case of 3 metal complex, a broad and asymmetric
single line is observed with a peak-to-peak line width ΔBpp
≈ 14.08 mT. The g-value is found to be ∼2.0076
for compound 3. However, the g-value
is found to be ∼2.001 for compound 4 along with
a broad line with a peak-to-peak line width, ΔBpp ≈ 64.3 mT.

Figure 5 EPR spectra of randomly oriented single crystals of radicals
and
metal complexes 1 (a) at 300 and 130 K, 2 (b) at 300 K, 3 (c) at 300 and 130 K, and 4 (d) at 300 K. The inset of (a,b) shows the EPR spectra of the radicals R1 and R2, respectively.

Room-temperature EPR measurements sometimes are not enough
to fully
characterize transition metal complexes, where, for example, for cobalt
high-spin d7 (S = 3/2), usually the relaxation
times are much too fast to see the cobalt response. Even EPR data
at 130 K {Figure 5a,c}
show only the signal from the radical and not from metal ions. To
get the signals from metals, for example, for Co high-spin fast relaxation,
a very low temperature of 4 K is needed. Thus, we mainly observe the
free-radical contribution and would need helium temperatures to find
cobalt resonances. This also leads to the large difference in the
reported g-value and the one used to fit the magnetic
measurements for cobalt, for example, in magnetic Mn and Co complexes
with a large polycyclic aromatic-substituted nitronyl nitroxide.54 Next, although more precise characterization
of discrete complexes in the dilute matrix (c = 10–3 M solvent liquid or frozen) can sometimes be made,
in the concentrated solid state with neighboring spin-carrying units,
such spectra are rarely analyzed because of the contribution of too
many effects. For 3, which gives a broadened line can
only be explained with radical Mn interaction and not only from the
radical. Even more for 4, we have another signal at nearly
half field (160 mT) which provides g ≈ 4.

3.3 Magnetic Properties
Figure 6a,b shows the temperature dependence
of the molar magnetic susceptibility under a magnetic field of 1000
Oe for the metal complexes 1 and 2, respectively.
The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility is measured in the
range of 5–300 K, and the plot of χ versus T is provided in Figure 6a for 1. The room-temperature value of χT for complexes 1 and 2 is found
to be ∼2.68 and ∼2.86 emu·K·mol–1 respectively, which is above the theoretically expected value (∼2.625
emu·K·mol–1) of χT for high-spin Co(II). The higher value of χT than the expected value for a system of one cobalt (II) ion (S = 3/2) and two radicals (S = 1/2) is
due to the orbital contribution of the cobalt(II) ion.

Figure 6 Temperature-dependent
molar magnetic susceptibility of randomly
oriented crystals of 1 (a) and 2 (b) under
a magnetic field of 1000 Oe. The red lines show the fit of the magnetic
data using eq 4 given
in the text for 1 and 2 metal complexes.
The inset shows the Curie–Weiss law fitting of the inverse
of the magnetic susceptibility data with respect to temperature using eq 2.

In the temperature range ∼50–300 K (paramagnetic
region), the susceptibility can be fitted by a straight line (shown
in the inset of both figures) using the Curie–Weiss law 2  where C is the Curie constant
and θp is the paramagnetic Curie temperature. The
values of θp are found to be −7 and −12
K for 1 and 2, respectively. The experimentally
observed effective paramagnetic moment, μeff is found
to be ∼4.41 μB/fu for 1. These
values are derived using the formula μeff = (3CKB/NA)1/2μB ≈ (8C)1/2μB, where NA is the Avogadro’s
number and KB is the Boltzmann constant.
The experimentally observed value of μeff is consistent
with the theoretically calculated spin-only values (4.58 μB/fu) for 1. For Co(II), that is, S = 3/2, ions are assumed to be in their high-spin states, in accordance
with the EPR measurements. Here, the theoretically expected (spin
only) value of μeff is calculated using the formula
(μeff)2 = ∑[g2{n·S(S + 1)}]μB2, where g is
the gyromagnetic ratio (∼2), n is the number
of magnetic ions with spin S in the formula unit,
and the summation ∑ runs over all magnetic ions in the formula
unit.

To understand the exchange interaction between Co(II)
and nitronyl
nitroxide radicals in 1, we have used a simple isotropic
Hamiltonian model to fit the temperature-dependent molar magnetic
susceptibility data in the paramagnetic state from 300 to 50 K. As
obtained from the XRD data, there exists a direct bonding of a spin-bearing
oxygen atom of nitronyl nitroxide radicals to Co(II), which would
lead to a spin–spin interaction between the metal ions and
the radicals. The magnetic data also suggest that the interaction
is antiferromagnetic in nature. The Hamiltonian used for the model,
fitted to the magnetization data of the metal–radical interactions,
is expressed as 3  where J represents the magnetic
coupling for the Co–radical; Sz is the average value of projection of the total
spin of the cluster on the z axis; and D is the zero-field splitting parameter of the Co(II) ion. Considering
the above Hamiltonian, fitting the magnetic susceptibility55,56 data in the paramagnetic temperature range 300–30 K has been
used for compound 1. 4            where J stands for the exchange
interaction between Co(II) and the nitronyl nitroxide radicals, g is Lande’s constant, KB is the Boltzmann constant, μβ is the Bohr
magneton, and NA is the Avogadro’s
number. The best fit parameters J/KB = −328 K, g = 2.02, and D = −2.39 K with R = 1.57 ×
10–4, where R is defined as R = ∑[(χM)calc –
(χM)expt]2/∑[(χM)expt]2. The negative value of J indicates an antiferromagnetic coupling between an octahedral
high-spin Co(II) and coordinated nitronyl nitroxide radicals. The
previously reported data on the nitronyl nitroxide-based metal complexes
using Co(hfac)2 also indicate that the oxygen atoms of
the radicals are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled to Co(II)
ions.6,57,58 Because the
bond lengths and bond angles are comparable to those of the previously
reported compounds, the antiferromagnetic interaction between metal
and radicals in the 1 dimer complex is verified and quantified.

The compound 2 is not coordinated with the N–O
unit of the radical; however, the Co ion is coordinated through the
hydrogen bonding of the water molecule (model shown below). The structural
analysis of the compound allows us to select exchange interactions
in the following way.59where each Co(II) ion interacts via OH groups of water molecules
with N–O groups of two neighboring molecules. Irrespective
of the method of selecting an exchange interaction, the theoretical
description of its magnetic properties may be treated like a magnetic
system of the Co(II) ion plus two nitroxide radicals59 {Co(II) ion + two nitroxide radicals}. The strict analysis
of the magnetic data of Co(II) complexes needs to consider the effects
of spin–orbit coupling and zero-field splitting. A more elaborate
model, taking into account all these factors, may be constructed,
but it will be then over parameterized. The Hamiltonian used in this
case is therefore the same as in the case of compound 1. For compound 2, eq 4 has been used for fitting the magnetization data in
the paramagnetic temperature range 300–30 K. The best fit parameters J/KB = −1.25 K, g = 2.21, and D = −0.31 K with R = 1.1 × 10–4, where R is defined as R = ∑[(χM)calc – (χM)expt]2/∑[(χM)expt]2.

Figure 7a,b
shows
χ versus T curves for the metal complexes 3 and 4, respectively, in a field of 1000 Oe.
Compound 3 forms a chain-like structure. The room-temperature
value of χT for 3 is found to
be ∼4.98 emu·K·mol–1, which is
close to the theoretically expected value (∼5.125 emu·K·mol–1) of χT for Mn(II). Similarly,
χT is found to be ∼4.64 emu·K·mol–1·Oe–1 for compound 4, in good agreement with the theoretically expected value of χT ≈ 5.125 emu·K·mol–1·Oe–1 for the spins of Mn(II), S = 5/2, and two nitronyl nitroxide radicals of spins S = 1/2 at 300 K. The paramagnetic region is fitted by a straight
line (shown in the inset of Figure 7) using the Curie–Weiss law. The values of θp are found to be −16 and −9 K for 3 and 4, respectively. The negative values of θp indicate that the interaction between metal ions and the
organic radicals is antiferromagnetic in nature. The experimentally
observed effective paramagnetic moment, μeff, is
found to be 6.37 μB/f.u. for 3. The
experimentally observed value of μeff is consistent
with the theoretically calculated spin-only values (6.40 μB/fu) of the compounds. The Mn(II), that is, S = 5/2 ions are
assumed to be in their high-spin states.

Figure 7 Temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility data of randomly
oriented crystals of 3 (a) and 4 (b) under
the magnetic field of 1000 Oe. The red line shows the fit of the magnetic
susceptibility data in the temperature range of 300–20 K using eq 6 for compound 3 and eq 8 for compound 4 given in the text. The inset of the figure shows the Curie–Weiss
law fitting of the inverse of the magnetic susceptibility data with
respect to temperature using eq 2.

For 3 metal–complex,
the experimental susceptibility
has been analyzed using the nearest-neighbor spin of the radical and
the spin of Mn(II). The Hamiltonian is therefore defined for 3 as 5  where J is the exchange interaction
between Mn(II) and the nitronyl nitroxide radicals.

Because
the XRD provides a chain-like structure for complex 3, the exchange interaction between Mn(II) (SMn = 5/2) and the two nitronyl nitroxide radicals (Srad = 1/2) in this chain-like structure has
been calculated using the following susceptibility equation60 to fit the magnetic susceptibility data. 6  where X = |J|/kT.

The best-fitted parameters are J/KB = −248 K, g = 2.4,
and R = 1.17 × 10–4.

Because compound 4 exhibits a three-spin model, two
nitronyl nitroxide radicals plus the Mn(II) ion, and the magnetic
susceptibility data of metal complex 4 is analyzed using
three-spin Hamiltonians61 7  

The following equation was derived for fitting of the magnetic
susceptibility data.61,62 8  where J is the exchange
interaction
integral between Mn(II) and the nitronyl nitroxide radicals. The best-fit
parameters are obtained with 2J/KB = −512 K (J/KB = −256 K), g = 2.23, and R = 1.08 × 10–4.

The negative
values of J indicate an antiferromagnetic
coupling between an octahedral high spin of metal ions and coordinated
nitronyl nitroxide radicals. The previously reported findings6,40,63,64 for similar metal–radical complexes also specify either antiferromagnetic
or ferromagnetic type of interactions between the metal and nitronyl
nitroxide radicals, depending on the nature of the radicals. Moreover,
the reported values of magnetic exchange interactions are also in
agreement with the present magnitude of J for the
studied metal complexes. For example, Mn(hfac)2 complexes
with the isoindoline nitroxide radical exhibit a ferrimagnetic nature
of the compound with the value of J/KB in the range of −162 to −214 K.65 In another example, a ferrimagnetic chain-like structure
has been observed involving Mn and nitronyl nitroxide radicals with J/KB in the range of −329.8
to −208.2 K.17 Similarly, the Mn(hfac)2-bridged [2-(3-pyridyl)(nitronyl nitoxide)-Mn(hfac)2]2 chain complex exhibits a large antiferromagnetic interaction
of J/KB = −185
K.66

To rationalize further the observed
behavior of the four complexes,
the magnetic exchange interactions for 1, 2, 3, and 4 compounds are calculated theoretically
and discussed.

3.4 Molecular Models and Computational
Protocol
The quantum chemical calculations are carried out
on several models
of the metal–radical complexes. The advantage of using the
B3LYP functional in DFT over the years is that a certain amount of
the exact exchange should be present in the functional if quantitative
reproduction of the metal–organic spin exchange coupling is
sought. B3LYP is often employed in hybrid-spin organic–inorganic
complexes,49,50 and a previous study of similar
manganese(II)–nitroxide complexes67 is shown to properly reproduce the experimental data for the exchange
coupling constant with very good accuracy and allowed clarification
of the mechanism of spin–spin interaction (including reversal
of the ground-state multiplicity).

The geometry as shown in Figure 8 is extracted from
the X-ray structures. The repeating unit of the crystals is used as
a model structure in all cases. For one of the complexes (3), an extended geometry (Figure 8C) is also tested to mimic more correctly the molecular
environment around the inorganic spins. There, the second organic
“radical” bears no spin (eliminated by adding a hydrogen
atom to one of the nitroxide groups) to have identical spin–spin
coupling to model B, but at the same time, it allows the same intermolecular
interactions as in the X-ray structure. Even though model C is a rather
artificial construct, it serves the purpose to represent properly
the coordination sphere of the metal ion and allows taking into account
all other interactions, for example, electrostatic, donor–acceptor,
and so forth, except for the spin exchange with the second radical.
It should be noted that any of the two models for complex 3 will capture only the nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and
may not be quantitative for the entire spin chain. The latter would
require periodic calculations, which extend beyond the scope of the
study. A complete first coordination sphere of the metal ion is maintained
in all models. The energy of the spin states and the exchange integrals
calculated there from67 are summarized
in Table 3. The derivation
of the relationship between the energy differences and J/KB is given in the Supporting Information. It should be noted that all the theoretical
calculations are carried out at T = 0 K for all the
compounds.

Table 3 Spin Configurations
and Total Energy
of the Spin States of the Model Metal–Radical Structuresa
a Exchange integrals
estimated from
the energy difference between the most stable and the second most
stable multiplet are given. Organic spins are denoted in blue in the
spin configurations revealing that doublet for 1, triplet
for 2, quintet for 3, and quartet for 4 represent the magnetic ground state.

In all complexes, the inorganic
spins are antiferromagnetically
coupled to the organic ones, which coincides with the experimental
measurements. The ferromagnetic states are unlikely because they lie
at least 2.5 kcal/mol higher in energy than the low-spin ones (except
for 2). As could be expected, the magnitude of spin exchange
depends on the local environment. In 2, where Co(II)
has no direct contact with the organic radical, the two spin states
practically degenerate because the two types of spins are isolated.
In the other three systems, the exchange interaction is more appreciable,
leading to J/KB of ca.
−300 K. The numerical estimates for the four complexes are
very close to those obtained from the experimental data. Taking into
account the proper coordination sphere of the metal, however, is more
important. Inclusion of the additional organic molecule in model C,
even though it has no spin itself, results in the increase of the
exchange by almost 100 K compared to model B. If the second radical
in model C is included with its spin (the total energy values are
given in the Supporting Information), then
the antiferromagnetic interaction is weakened by ca. 30 K compared
to the value provided by the repeating unit model. There is also some
influence of the type of the organic radical on the size of spin–spin
coupling: it is slightly greater in R1-based metal complexes than in R2 ones (model A vs model E).

The atomic spin density distribution
(Scheme S1, Figures S2, and S3 in the Supporting Information) provides a clue toward the observed specificities.
The qualitative patterns arising because of the spin–spin interaction
in models A, C, and E are identical: almost an equal amount of spin
(∼0.03 for Co(II), and ∼0.015 for Mn(II)) is delocalized
on the coordinated oxygen atoms of hexafluoroacetylacetonate, and
the remaining fraction (∼0.24 for Mn(II), and ∼0.13
for Co(II)) of delocalized spins from the metal ion is transferred
to the coordinated oxygen atom(s) from nitronyl nitroxide. In model
B, the single-coordinated radical acquires less spin (0.183) from
manganese and, hence, the smaller exchange integral. Another common
feature of models A, C, and E is the spin redistribution that takes
place upon coordination of the nitronyl nitroxide radicals. In all
directly coordinated nitroxide fragments, the spin from the metal
ion is delocalized primarily on the oxygen atom, which possesses less
spin density than its adjacent nitrogen, whereas the situation is
reverse in the noncoordinated nitroxide group and in free nitronyl
nitroxide radicals. Such an effect, but much less pronounced, is seen
also in model D. There, the spin on the oxygen atom, which is closer
to the metal ion, is reduced and that of the nitrogen is increased
because of the minor spin transfer along a hydrogen bond formed with
the bridging water molecule. The spinless ligand in model C remains
as such. Only some miniscule spin delocalization/polarization is observed.
The isolated nature of the organic radical in model D is confirmed
by the total spin density distributed on the π-conjugated part
of the nitronyl nitroxide ring. It is −0.89 to −0.95
in models A, C, and E, whereas in model D, it extends to −1.03.
It should be noted that the remaining fraction of the unpaired electrons
in the organic molecules is spin-polarized on the phenoxy/thiophene
fragment (Scheme 2,
Figures S2, and S3, Supporting Information).

Scheme 2 Atomic Spin Densities of the Key Atoms Responsible for the
Spin–Spin
Interaction in the Most Stable State of the Modeled Structures
The complete set of values of
all multiplets is given in Figures S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information.

Although being
reasonable and corresponding well to the structural
characteristics of the investigated models, the sole picture of spin
transfer in the hybrid systems cannot explain the specific strength
of antiferromagnetic coupling in the various models. Therefore, the
overlap between the inorganic ion and the organic counterpart illustrated
by the natural molecular orbitals (Figure 9) is analyzed next.

Figure 9 Natural SOMOs of the
most stable spin state of the studied models.

The antiferromagnetic nature of the spin exchange becomes
evident
from the natural orbital plots. In models A and E, two d-orbitals
of the metal ions mix with the SOMOs of the organic radicals, yielding
two linear combinations with bonding overlap and two linear combinations
with antibonding. A similar type of overlap takes place in model C,
but only one of the d-orbitals of Mn(II) is involved because the model
includes only one organic radical. Nevertheless, the bonding overlap
seems to be the most efficient, giving rise to the strongest antiferromagnetic
coupling. Model D features a different SOMO pattern. Once more, linear
combinations between orbitals located on M(hfac)2 and on
the organic radical are formed. However, there is just a tiny bonding
overlap between the hydrogen atom of a water molecule and one of the
nitronyl nitroxide oxygen atoms in SOMO1, which gives rise to the
small spin transfer discussed above. All these observations are confirmed
by the occupation numbers of SOMOs summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

4 Conclusions
The crystal structure and magnetic properties
of 4-methoxy phenyl-
and thiophene-substituted nitronyl nitroxide-based four metal complexes
(1, 2, 3, and 4) have been investigated. The magnetic measurement confirms the presence
of antiferromagnetic type of interactions between the transition metal
ions and the nitronyl nitroxide radicals. DFT quantum chemical calculations
of the metal–radical complexes confirm antiferromagnetic spin–spin
interactions because of the bonding overlap between the metal and
the nitroxide contributions in the SOMOs. The calculations also indicate
spin delocalization from the metal ions to the organic radical in
metal–radical complexes.

5 Synthesis,
Experimental, and Calculation Details
All the chemicals and
the solvent are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
as reagent grade and used without further purification. For the synthesis
of complex 1, Co(hfac)2·2H2O (96 mg, 0.18 mmol) and R1 (50
mg, 0.18 mmol) are dissolved in a mixture of acetone and heptane (10/10
mL); then, the resulting solution is heated to 75 °C for 1 h
and then cooled down to room temperature. Well-shaped, brown-colored,
block-like crystals of complex 1 are obtained, which
are separated out for single-crystal XRD measurements. For the synthesis
of 2, Co(hfac)2·xH2O (105.02 mg, 0.20 mmol) and R2 (50 mg, 0.20 mmol) are dissolved in a mixture of acetone and
heptane (10/10 mL), and then the resulting solution is stirred for
1 h. The filtrated solution is left at room temperature for crystallization.
Well-shaped, blue needle-like crystals are obtained after 3 days.
For complex 3, Mn(hfac)2·xH2O (89 mg, 0.18 mmol) and R1 (50 mg, 0.18 mmol) and for complex 4, Mn(hfac)2·xH2O (96.7 mg, 0.20 mmol)
and R2 (50 mg, 0.20 mmol) are
dissolved in a mixture of acetone and heptane (10/10 mL) at room temperature.
After 3 days, well-shaped, blue and green needle-like crystals of
complexes 3 and 4 in millimeter size are
obtained respectively.

The single-crystal XRD measurements are
performed on a STOE IPDS
2T diffractometer over an angular (2θ) range of 2°–28°
using Mo Kα radiation. A detailed structural analysis
is performed on the XRD data by SHELXL-2014 (full matrix) program.
The EPR measurement is carried out using a Bruker EMaxPlus A/P/W spectrometer
equipped with an NMR gauss meter and a variable-temperature-control
continuous-flow-N2 cryostat (Bruker B-VT 2000). The infrared
(IR) spectra are recorded using KBr-pressed pellets on a Nicolet 730
FT-IR spectrometer (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The temperature-dependent magnetization data are recoded
using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum
Design, USA) in the temperature range 2–300 K. Elemental analysis
is carried out on a Foss Heraeus Vario. 1: Anal. Calcd

Single-point computations on the X-ray geometry
of each complex
are performed with the DFT functional B3LYP68−71 and basis set 6-31G*.72 The core electrons of the metal ions are replaced
by a RSC Stuttgart/Dresden ECP.73 Unrestricted
open shell wave functions are generated for all feasible spin states
of the complexes (with the spins of the metal ions kept at their experimental
values: S = 3/2 for Co(II) and S = 5/2 for Mn(II)). Mulliken spin densities and natural molecular
orbitals are calculated to estimate the amount of spin transfer and
the nature of electron exchange. All simulations are done with the
program package Gaussian 09.74
