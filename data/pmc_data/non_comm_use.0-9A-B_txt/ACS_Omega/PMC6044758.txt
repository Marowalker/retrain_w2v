Widespread
prevalence of multidrug and pandrug-resistant bacteria
has prompted substantial concern over the global dissemination of
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Environmental compartments can
behave as genetic reservoirs and hotspots, wherein resistance genes
can accumulate and be laterally transferred to clinically relevant
pathogens. In this work, we explore the ARG copy quantities in three
environmental media distributed across four cities in California and
demonstrate that there exist city-to-city disparities in soil and
drinking water ARGs. Statistically significant differences in ARGs
were identified in soil, where differences in blaSHV gene copies were the most striking; the highest copy
numbers were observed in Bakersfield (6.0 × 10–2 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies and 2.6 × 106 copies/g
of soil), followed by San Diego (1.8 × 10–3 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies and 3.0 × 104 copies/g
of soil), Fresno (1.8 × 10–5 copies/16S-rRNA
gene copies and 8.5 × 102 copies/g of soil), and Los
Angeles (5.8 × 10–6 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies
and 5.6 × 102 copies/g of soil). In addition, ARG
copy numbers in the air, water, and soil of each city are contextualized
in relation to globally reported quantities and illustrate that individual
genes are not necessarily predictors for the environmental resistome
as a whole.

==== Body
Introduction
A sustained rise in
antimicrobial resistance is predicted to lead
to 10 million deaths per year by 2050, with the current resistance
accounting for a minimum of 700 000 lives lost per year.1,2 Concurrently, recent cases of multi- and pandrug-resistant bacteria
have raised questions about the future of the current last line of
defense antibiotics and, by extension, the future treatability of
common bacterial infections.3,4

Emergence of antibiotic-resistant
pathogenic bacteria has directed
substantial attention toward antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which
confer resistance and can be transferred among bacteria through horizontal
gene transfer (HGT).5 Additionally, environmental
co-selective pressures can drive antibiotic-resistant strain development,
promote persistence of ARGs, and result in ARG abundance in the absence
of antibiotic selective pressure.6−8 Considered as environmental
contaminants of emerging concern, ARG abundance in environmental compartments
warrants increased documentation.9−12 Indeed, recent work has pointed
to the importance of environmental routes for disease transmission,13−15 with several examples of ARGs in clinical isolates believed to be
derived from environmental bacteria.15

Possible ARG sources to the environment, including wastewater treatment
plants,16−18 confined animal feeding operations,19,20 manure-fertilized fields,21 and medical
waste streams,22,23 comprise an intricate system
that consistently inputs ARGs into the environment. However, although
these sources continue to be explored, the current volume of studies
on the extent of dissemination of ARGs in environmental compartments
is lacking.

Background ARG quantities in soils have been confirmed
as altered
and increasing due to anthropogenic antibiotic use,19,21,24 but there is little research quantitatively
reporting them. Instead, data often focus on fold increases due to
a particular human activity, such as manure application21,25−27 or reclaimed water use,28−30 making site-to-site
comparisons difficult. Studies on waterborne ARG quantities are more
extensively available and have included surface,31,32 ground20 and coastal waters,33 drinking water effluent,34,35 and tap water,36,37 but the large majority of investigation
has not involved water systems that directly interact with general
populations, leaving open questions concerning ARG exposure. Air is
by far the least studied environmental compartment with the majority
of research addressing only antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB).38−40 Some quantitative ARG values have been reported; however, these
are typically in response to and downwind of a suspected source, rarely
concerning ARGs affecting populations outside of immediate feedlot
vicinities.41−43

When available, studies reporting ARG quantities
in environmental
compartments are often difficult or impossible to compare, with researchers
reporting results in different units, as well as reporting different
genes. Moreover, a broad resistance profile of a particular site is
rare, with many studies focused solely on a single environmental compartment.
Several public databases and global surveillance projects exist; however,
these focus on clinical isolates, rather than ARGs in the environment.

In this study, ARGs were assessed in 26 public parks across 4 major
California cities and three environmental media: soil, drinking water,
and air. It was hypothesized that unique ARG profiles exist across
medium, genes and location, such that when comparing cities within
California, city-to-city differences would be identified. Air, water,
and soil from each site was analyzed for two ARGs, sul1 and blaSHV, as well as the bacterial
16S-rRNA gene. Additionally, all soil samples were analyzed for the ermF and ermB genes. sul1 gene was selected for inclusion in this study due to its proposed
use as an urbanization marker,44 its propensity
for persisting in the environment,45,46 and a high
degree of previously recorded data, which allows for ARG quantity
contextualization. The blaSHV gene was
included in this study due to its close relationship to the genes
suggested for environmental monitoring.47 Additionally, along with erm genes, blaSHV gene copy quantities had been shown to be increasing
in soils.24ermB and ermF have both been proposed as indicators for assessing
the antibiotic resistance status of a particular environment.47 Together, ermB and ermF can shed light on possible differences in genes that
are closely related and operate via similar resistance mechanisms.

Through this work, we sought to provide a more comprehensive approach
to documenting ARG exposure across a given region by introducing a
study design that has not been utilized in conjunction with ARG monitoring.
Additionally, this study is to our knowledge, the first to contextualize
reported ARG quantities in relation to those reported globally.

Results
blaSHV
Gene copies of blaSHV, with gene copies defined as the quantity
of the target gene present in sample as determined via qPCR, were
regularly detected in all soil samples. For blaSHV gene copy numbers measured per gram of soil, all city-to-city
comparisons, with the exception of the Los Angeles–Fresno comparison,
revealed statistically significant differences (Welch’s t-test p < 0.05, comparing two cities
at a time each with n = 24) (Table 1), with ARG copy numbers highest in Bakersfield
(5.1 × 105 to 6.9 × 106 copies/g)
followed by San Diego (7.7 × 102 to 9.0 × 104 copies/g when detected) and tailed by both Los Angeles and
Fresno (3.5 × 101 to 2.1 × 103 and
1.5 × 101 to 6.7 × 103 copies/g respectively),
as summarized in Figure 1. When normalized by 16S-rRNA gene copies, city-to-city differences
persisted (Table 1),
with all relationships now found to statistically differ (p < 0.1). City quantities for blaSHV gene copies from highest to lowest were: Bakersfield (1.9
× 10–2 to 2.2 × 10–1 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies), San Diego (1.5 × 10–5 to 1.2 × 10–2 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies),
Fresno (5.1 × 10–7 to 6.5 × 10–5 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies), and Los Angeles (8.2 × 10–7 to 1.6 × 10–5 copies/16S-rRNA
gene copies), as summarized in Figure 1.

Table 1 P-Values from Welch’s T-Test Comparisons between Soils in California Cities
Detection of blaSHV fluctuated in drinking
water samples collected from Los Angeles, Bakersfield, and Fresno.
In contrast, blaSHV was detected in all
San Diego drinking water samples, as shown in Figure 2 (gene copy numbers ranged from 5.5 ×
102 to 10.0 × 103 copies/L). Gene copy
numbers normalized to per liter of drinking water were statistically
different when comparing each city (p < 0.1),
with the exception of an LA–Fresno comparison (Table 2). Overall, the ranking of gene
copy number from highest to lowest was found to be: San Diego, Bakersfield,
and equivalent lower relative ranking for Los Angeles and Fresno.
When gene copy numbers were compared per 16S-rRNA gene copy number
(Figure 2), all city
differences were statistically significant (p <
0.1), with the exception of the LA versus Fresno and San Diego versus
Bakersfield comparisons (Table 2). When viewed in relation to 16S-rRNA gene, two tiers were
seen, with San Diego and Bakersfield both showing higher gene copy
numbers (2.7 × 10–2 to 1.3 and 5.0 × 10–2 to 2.1 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies respectively)
than those of Los Angeles and Fresno (9.4 × 10–5 to 5.1 × 10–3 and 4.0 × 10–3 to 8.6 × 10–2 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies,
respectively).

gene copies.

Table 2 P-Values from Welch’s T-Test Comparisons
between Tap Water in California Cities
Because of sampling constraints, air was sampled at
only two sites
per city, with each site sampled in replicates of three to five. The
exception to this was Fresno, where three sites were sampled. blaSHV copy numbers per liter of air sampled
revealed higher blaSHV gene copy numbers
in Fresno (0.19–600 copies/m3), with the gene copy
numbers in Bakersfield, Los Angeles, and San Diego all found to be
lower than the Fresno gene copy numbers by approximately 50% but comparable
to each other (Figure 3). When analyzed per 16S-rRNA gene copy number, Los Angeles gene
copy numbers were the lowest (3.8 × 10–4 to
9.3 × 10–3 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies), with
significant overlaps among the Fresno, Bakersfield, and San Diego
sites (Figure 3).

quantities in California air. ARG gene copy numbers in air across
four California cities: (a) blaSHV copy
numbers normalized to per liter of air, (b) blaSHV copies per 16S-rRNA gene copies, (c) sul1 copy numbers normalized to per liter of air, and (d) sul1 copies per 16S-rRNA gene copies.

sul1
sul1 was consistently
detected in soil across all parks and cities studied, with some variability
observed to occur within any given park. City-to-city comparisons
for sul1 gene copy numbers were found to be statistically
different when comparing San Diego parks to those in Fresno (Table 1), with higher sul1 gene copy numbers measured in San Diego (p = 0.06). When normalized by 16S-rRNA gene copy number, San Diego
was found to have a higher gene presence than both Fresno and Bakersfield
(p < 0.06), with similar gene copy quantities
observed in Fresno and Bakersfield (Table 1). Los Angeles exhibited the most park-to-park
variability (ranging 1.5 × 105 to 4.0 × 108 copies/g and 9.0 × 10–4 to 2.7 copies/16S-rRNA
gene copies), and ARG quantities did not prove to be significantly
different from any of the other three cities, regardless of the normalization
approach. sul1 values in soil were found to vary
from 1.1 × 105 to 2.2 × 107 copies/g
to 9.0 × 10–4 to 5.1 × 10–1 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies, with two LA park values yielding particularly
high values of 2.0 × 108 and 4.0 × 108 copies/g, and 2.6 and 2.7 copies/16S-rRNA gene copies (Figure 1).

The presence
of sul1 per liter of water sampled was highly variable
in San Diego (detected in 30% samples), Bakersfield (detected in 21%
of samples), and Fresno (detected in 13% samples), with Fresno having
the lowest frequency of gene detection. In contrast, sul1 was detected in 100% (n = 18) of Los Angeles drinking
water samples. Absolute gene copy numbers of sul1
in San Diego, Bakersfield, and Fresno proved too variable to result
in statistically significant city-to-city differences when compared
to those of Los Angeles and to each other, as shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. When analyzing gene copies per copies of
16S-rRNA gene (Figure 2), only the LA–Fresno comparison exhibited a statistically
significant city difference, with higher gene copy numbers observed
in Los Angeles than those in Fresno (p = 0.08).

sul1 gene copy numbers in air were found to vary
widely within individual cities with Fresno air measurements ranging
from 1.5 × 101 to 5.3 × 103 copies/m3, Bakersfield ranging from 1.4 × 102 to 7.2
× 102 copies/m3, Los Angeles ranging from
1.6 × 101 to 1.6 × 102 copies/m3, and San Diego ranging from 1.7 × 10–2 to 2 copies/ m3. Absolute copy numbers per liter of air
indicate a higher incidence of sul1 gene found in
Fresno site 2 when compared to that found in the other three cities
(Figure 3). After normalizing
by 16S-rRNA gene copy number, Fresno site 2 gene copy numbers remained
highest, followed by Bakersfield site 1 as a distant second (Figure 3).

ermF and ermB
Gene
copy measurements for both ermF and ermB were obtained for soil samples, with both genes greatly fluctuating
when detectable (Figure 4); ermF fluctuated between 3.9 × 100 and 2.6 × 105 copies/g and between 1.7 × 10–8 copies/16S-rRNA gene and 2.7 × 10–2 copies/16S-rRNA gene, whereas ermB fluctuated from 1.1 × 100 and 8.4 × 103 copies/g, and between 7.0 ×
10–9 copies/16S-rRNA gene and 2.7 × 10–4 copies/16S-rRNA gene (Figure 4). In general, the ermF
gene had a higher frequency of detection than that of ermB. ermF was consistently identified in Los Angeles
park soils, with only one triplicate from site 1 failing to amplify
via qPCR. All other cities contained at least one park with confirmed
ARG readings obtained for only one out of three park samples. Overall, ermF detection frequency decreased in the order: Los Angeles,
Fresno, San Diego, and finally Bakersfield. ermB
was identified much less frequently, with the frequency of detection
decreasing in the order: Fresno, Bakersfield, San Diego, and finally
Los Angeles. No statistically different city-to-city relationships
could be determined for either gene, regardless of the normalization
technique. These results place ermF as per the above
reported values and ermB as well below those currently
shown in the literature.

California ARG Quantities in Global Context
Previous
reports of sul1 per 16S-rRNA gene copies in archived
soils, lake, and river sediments and environmental soil prior to manure
or wastewater application allow this study to place average California
soil quantities as generally above those currently documented in Germany,21 along the Poudre River in Colorado,31 and in a cornfield in Virginia.26 However, the range of values seen in this study is wide
enough to be inclusive of many values reported in the aforementioned
studies. The highest values previously published are identified as
those in sediment from Lake Geneva, Switzerland (approx. up to 0.08
copies/16S-rRNA gene copies).48 The higher
spectrum of values reported from the Lake Geneva site are found to
be comparable to the quantities found in this study, although readings
for San Diego and Los Angeles exceed the largest reported lake sediment
values at several sampling sites. To our knowledge, these values place
California sul1 gene copy numbers in soil above or
comparable to the highest reported values. Absolute copy number was
found to rarely be reported for sul1 in the soil
compartment, with absolute values identified having also been reported
as per 16S-rRNA gene copies.28

Gene
copy numbers of sul1 normalized to per 16S-rRNA gene
copies in aquatic environmental compartments have been documented
in rivers, seas, lakes, bays, reservoirs, reclaimed water, and to
a scarce extent, in drinking water. Placed within the context of these
studies, it can be determined that drinking water ARG gene copy numbers
observed in the California cities studied are generally higher than
those recorded in lakes, rivers, and bays in locations ranging from
Manila49 to China33 and Colorado31 among others. Water bodies
similar in order of magnitude to cities in California have been recorded
in an urban and industrial river,50 sites
along the Baltic Sea,51 Swiss lakes,52 and in drinking water treated from Lake Taihu,
China.53 However, nearly all drinking water
samples obtained from Los Angeles, CA, exceed these reported values
by nearly an order of magnitude.

Relative to reporting for sul1, information on blaSHV is
infrequent, making global contextualization
difficult. blaSHV per 16S-rRNA gene copy
numbers have been reported in sediments in Cuba as well as in archived
Scottish soils.7,54 ARG quantities in Cuban sediment
were found to generally be comparable to soil values obtained for
Fresno and Los Angeles, with Scottish soil values falling above those
in Fresno and Los Angeles but below those in Bakersfield and San Diego.
Absolute blaSHV values were only found
reported once in Cuban sediments, with values found to be comparable
to San Diego.

Although there exists scarce reporting of the blaSHV gene copy numbers in water bodies, this
study is able
to place blaSHV drinking water quantities
in Los Angeles and Fresno as below those reported in the Baltic Sea51 and along the Almendares River in Cuba.54 However, several Bakersfield and nearly all
San Diego samples were found to fall within or above the range reported
for the Baltic Sea (approx. 500–1000 copies/L). These two cities
fell below the grand mean reported in the Almandres River in Cuba
(approx. 105 copies/L), but Los Angeles gene copy numbers
were generally within its range of seasonal variation (approx. 1.3
× 103 to 3.2 × 105).

ermF copies per 16S-rRNA gene copies were found
to occur in the literature in archived Scottish soils,7 with values far lower than the values frequently identified
in this study. Other studies reporting ermF report
nondetection of readings.26ermB values have been reported in sediments in Cuba (103.7–105.4 copies/g),54 with
these falling well above those identified in all California cities
studied.

Intergene Observations
When analyzing drinking water
samples, we observe that San Diego dominates in blaSHV presence across the cities studied, with the dominant
city shifting to Los Angeles when analyzing the sul1 gene. This implies that it is ineffective to test for a small number
of genes and assume results to be representative of ARG abundance
in general. This is further observed when observing ermF and ermB soil data. Both genes provide resistance
to erythromycin, acting as adenine N-6-methyltransferases
and keeping erythromycin from inhibiting aminoacyl translocation.
Despite having a similar function and conferring resistance to the
same drug, city-to-city detection comparisons reveal that one gene
is not necessarily a predictor for the other. This indicates that
even genes closely related in function may not be able to behave as
indicators for each other.

Statistical Analysis
Linear regression
and correlation
matrices between each gene and population, population density, and
distance from the nearest feedlot operation revealed no direct relationships
in either environmental compartment. ARGs across each environmental
compartment could not be largely attributed to a particular factor.
Instead, there exists a multifaceted set of influences that make ARG
quantity prediction complex. In addition, statistical analysis between
genes across environmental compartments additionally yielded no direct
relationship between genes.

Environment and Health
A study of
the resistome in
human and environmental samples in low-income human habitats indicated
ARG sharing between human, animal, and environmental microbial communities,
reporting a positive correlation between the proportion of ARG contigs
with a mobile genetic element (MGE) and the number of habitats encoding
antibiotic resistance proteins, indicating a role for MGEs in environmental
transfer.13

It is when analyzing blaSHV in soils that we see the highest indicator
of disparities in ARG quantities across cities. This is pertinent,
as it has been suggested that blaSHV be
given a REScon1 risk categorization, indicating that there exists
published evidence that blaSHV poses a
substantial risk for resistance dissemination and treatment failure.55 This is further alarming when considered in
conjunction with the lack of current reporting for this gene, necessitating
the re-evaluation of current approaches in reporting.

To conclude,
this work amalgamates and extends observations reported
globally on the quantity of ARGs in drinking water, soil, and air.
Our results indicate that there exists a disparity in ARG quantities
in the environment across four major cities within California. Additionally,
this disparity is observed to be distinct within each environmental
compartment as well as for each gene measured, highlighting the importance
of testing a collection of ARGs to effectively identify environmental
reservoirs and hinting at a complicated set of factors that dictate
environmental ARG presence. These results were found to be consistent
when gene copy numbers were analyzed by two different and widely used
approaches, quantitative gene copy number per mass or volume of compartment
as well as per 16S-rRNA gene copy. Future work should include follow-up
studies to determine whether significant reservoirs for ARGs play
the dual role of also being hotspots for HGT.

This article presents
a monitoring approach that if standardized,
prompts a more thorough global assessment and reporting of ARG quantities
in environmental compartments. Moving forward, future regional assessments
should focus on genes categorized as posing a higher risk for being
acquired by and conferring resistance to human pathogens and should
include data on co-contaminants, soil characterization, MGEs, and
microbial community, where possible to create a larger database for
statistical analysis. In doing so, further trends that might aid our
understanding of antibiotic resistance proliferation and the dissemination
of ARGs will be more easily identified.

Materials and Methods
Site Selection
Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno, and
Bakersfield were chosen to provide a balance of land uses as well
as a range of urbanization. For each city, three of the parks chosen
were in the heart of the city, whereas the other three were positioned
toward the outskirts. Proximity to major highways, where mixing of
environmental influence and vehicular pollution was most likely, was
avoided where possible. Priorities for inclusion in the study included
accessible soil, presence of a water source, and access to a safe
and stable air-sampling location. A catalog of parks chosen for inclusion
in this study along with population, population density, zip code,
degree of urbanization, and distance from the nearest feedlot can
be found in Table 1 of the Supporting Information.

Park urbanization was categorized
as high, mid, or low on the basis of the number of roads and buildings
located within a 500 m radius of the park. The parks whose 500 m radius
included ≥75 buildings and ≥15 roads were categorized
as highly urban, whereas the parks whose radius included ≤50
buildings and ≤10 roads were categorized as having low urbanization.
Any park that fell between these designations was denoted as having
midlevel urbanization. Buildings that fell on the circumference line
were included in the count if over half of the building fell within
the designated area of interest. This urbanization scheme is a modified
urban intensity index as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). A summary of urbanization categorization for each site
can be found in Table 1.

Sample Collection
Soils
Three meter-squared plots
were randomly selected
at each park for soil sampling. Top soil was collected in 50 mL sterile
falcon tubes by randomly selecting ten points in each plot and dipping
the falcon tube to gather top soil (0–2.5 cm), yielding a composite
sample representative of the meter-squared plot. This was repeated
for the remaining two plots, yielding three falcon tubes that would
be taken as representative of the site. Rocks and grass were avoided
or removed using sterilized plastic scoops. Samples were kept on ice
until transported to the laboratory, where tubes were stored at 4
°C prior to processing. For processing, soil tubes were extensively
shaken to homogenize the ten points of collection and 0.25 g of each
soil was weighed into individual 2 mL screw cap tubes preloaded with
1 ± 0.05 g, 0.7 mm garnet beads (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad,
CA) before being stored at −20 °C to await DNA extraction.56 The remaining soil was used to conduct a moisture
content, hydrolysis (soil composition), and loss on ignition analysis
(see Table 2). All
of the soil was processed within a week of sampling. Three samples
were collected from each of the 24 parks, resulting in a total of n = 72 soil samples.

Tap Water
At each
site, tap water was collected from
either drinking fountains or exterior spigots. All water sources used
were publicly accessible, and drinking fountains were prioritized
whenever possible. Polypropylene plastic bottles used for sampling
were washed and treated with 1.2 N HCl overnight before being rinsed
three times with milliQ water immediately prior to sample collection.
A total of 10 L of sample was collected at each park just prior to
returning to the laboratory. Samples took several minutes to obtain,
and the resulting 10 L were a composite of water initially exiting
each fountain (no flushing) as well as after several minutes of flushing.
Samples were kept on ice for the duration of transport and stored
at 4 °C until the time of processing. Processing consisted of
vacuum-filtering 3 L of sample water through a 47 mm diameter, 0.4
μm pore size polycarbonate filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA). After filtration, filters were folded and placed into 2 mL screw
cap tubes preloaded with 1 ± 0.05 g of 0.7 mm diameter garnet
beads (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), as required for DNA
extraction. Tubes were subsequently stored at −20 °C,
awaiting DNA extraction. All processing was performed in triplicate
and all samples were processed within 48 h of collection.

Air
Air was collected in as close a proximity to parks
as possible and not directly in parks due to considerations including
park hours and duration of the sampling trip. Because of time constraints
inherent to air sampling, not every park was sampled for air, yielding
a smaller n for air than that for soil and tap water.
Air was collected at two sites per city, except for Fresno, where
samples were collected from three sites. All sampling occurred in
the months of January through March, 2015 to ensure that all cities
were sampled within the same season, minimizing seasonal variation
as a possible cause for city ARG disparities.57 In total, 24 samples were obtained for tap water and soil and 9
samples were obtained for air. Summary information for the sampling
duration and sampling window can be found in Table S3.

Air sampling was conducted using three to five simultaneously
operating personal pumps (SKC 224-PCXR4 Aircheck Sampler, SKC Inc.
Eighty Four, PA). Operation was set to a flow rate of 2 L/min for
at least 4 h, and air samples were obtained from a height of approximately
1 m. Longer sampling times were preferable if possible and variances
between sampling duration were corrected for during data analysis.
The use of 7 mm diameter, 0.4 μm pore size polycarbonate filters
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 45.72 mm, 1.6 μm glass fiber
filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) was interchangeable, with glass
fiber filters manually cut in a sterile environment to a size of 7
mm. A short preliminary experiment conducted prior to sampling concluded
that both filter types yielded a comparable quantity of DNA for the
same sampling duration upon extraction. Upon sampling completion,
all filters were immediately folded and placed in 2 mL screw cap tubes
preloaded with 1 ± 0.05 g of 0.7 mm diameter garnet beads (MO
BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) as specified for DNA extraction.
Sample tubes were placed on ice and kept at 4 °C to the extent
possible before transport to the laboratory, where they were stored
at −20 °C prior to DNA extraction.

DNA Extraction
All drinking water and soil DNA extractions
were completed using the MoBio PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO
Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) within 1 week of collection. Air
samples were extracted within 3 months of collection. Extractions
proceeded as per the manufacturer’s guidelines except for the
cell lysis step, where bead-beating for 2 min via a BioSpec MiniBeadbeater-8
(BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) was used in place of vortexing.
An additional 2 mL screw cap tube preloaded with 1 ± 0.05 g of
0.7 mm diameter garnet beads (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad,
CA) and without sample (extraction blank) was included in every extraction
to identify the contamination incurred during the extraction process,
should it occur. Eluted DNA was aliquoted and stored at −20
°C, awaiting qPCR analysis. The total DNA concentration was determined
using UV absorption via a Nanodrop 2000 C (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA), as were 260/280 absorbance ratios. Gene recovery for samples
of similar soil composition extracted, as described in this study,
was calculated via a matrix spike and found to be 83%. For matrix
spike methods, see Supporting Information.

qPCR
All samples were analyzed for ARG abundance of sul1, blaSHV, and the 16S-rRNA
gene, (a total bacteria surrogate measure) via qPCR. Soil samples
were additionally analyzed for ermB and ermF genes. All assays utilized SYBR Green Master Mix and entailed a
25 μL of reaction volume consisting of 12.5 μL of 2X SYBR
Green Master Mix (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 1.25 μL
of each primer, forward and reverse primer, and at least 2 μL
of the template DNA, with molecular-grade water comprising any remaining
reaction volume. Primers used were as developed and validated previously
in the literature24,58 and can be found in Table S4, along with primer concentrations. Each
assay run included a 7-point standard curve positive control, all
applicable extraction blanks, and a negative control of molecular-grade
water, with each sample plated in triplicate. All assays were performed
in 96-well reaction plates using StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems).
The temperature cycles used can be found in Table S3 and were as reported previously in literature.24,58

Both soil and water samples were diluted to a concentration
of 0.25 ng/μL prior to qPCR to offset inhibition effects, as
confirmed by well spike and inhibition dilution. Although the sul1 gene assay was found to amplify smoothly for a total
mass of 0.5 ng DNA, the blaSHV, ermF, ermB, and 16S-rRNA gene assays were
modified to contain 2.5 ng to properly amplify. Template DNA and molecular-grade
water volumes were varied as was necessary for each assay. Dilution
factors were back-calculated during data analysis to reverse this
effect and obtain per volume or per mass quantification. This dilution
process was not found to be necessary for air samples. For well spike
and inhibition dilution methods, see Supporting Information.

Target-containing DNA fragments to serve
as positive controls were
designed using Geneious coupled with NCBI database information and
ordered through IDT Technologies. Known concentrations of the designed
DNA fragment were run alongside environmental samples, yielding a
seven-point standard curve and allowing for quantitation of gene copies.
Melt curves were used to further verify correct target gene amplification.

Cataloging Globally Reported ARG Quantities
When assessing
reported ARG quantities, only peer-reviewed articles were considered.
Literature was confined to those reporting genes corresponding to
the present study, where qPCR was used to determine ARG in environmental
samples. Studies assessing gene quantities in subsets, that is, ARB
that were cultured and subsequently analyzed via qPCR, were excluded.
Included studies reported values for gene count per volume or mass,
or a ratio of gene of interest per 16S-rRNA gene. Values used for
comparison to the present data set were estimated from plots where
necessary, although directly reported values were prioritized when
available. Values considered did not include quantities reported following
an input of interest, that is, intentional antibiotic enrichment,
reclaimed water use, metals enrichment, and so forth. It is important
to note that due to limited reporting values presented here are compared
to values across different years.
