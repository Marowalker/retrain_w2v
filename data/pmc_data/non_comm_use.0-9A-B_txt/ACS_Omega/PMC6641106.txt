Large-area self-assembly
of functional conjugated polymers holds
a great potential for practical applications of organic electronic
devices. We obtained well-aligned films of poly[2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1) using the floating film transfer
method. Thereby, a droplet of the TQ1 solution was injected on top
of the surface of an immiscible liquid substrate, at the meniscus
formed at the edge of a Petri dish, from where the polymer solution
and the film spread in one direction. Characterization of the TQ1
film using the recently developed two-dimensional polarization imaging
(2D POLIM) revealed large, millimeter-sized domains of oriented polymer
chains. The irregular shape of the contact line at the droplet source
induced the appearance of disordered stripes perpendicular to the
spreading direction. A correlation of polarization parameters measured
using 2D POLIM revealed the microstructure of such stripes, providing
valuable information for further improvement and possible upscaling
of this promising method.

Introduction
Devices based on conjugated
polymers have been of great interest
because of their versatile semiconductor properties and solution processabilities,
which shows a great advantage and potential in large-scale industrial
manufacturing.1−3 Generally, the functionality and performance of devices
dramatically depend on the polymer organization, especially for organic
field-effect transistors.4,5 In particular, it is
of great interest to control the degree of order of polymer chain
organization at a broad range of scales. Using a self-assembly strategy,
polymer films could be successfully aligned into a well-oriented pattern
from a solution.6−12 Recently, liquid substrates have gained increasing interest for
their ability to support self-organization of nanoparticles in thin
films.13,14 In a similar way, suitable liquid substrates
support the self-organization of organic polymers, as demonstrated
by the floating film transfer method, recently developed by Takashima
and co-workers.7,15−17 Thereby, a
drop of a polymer solution is placed on top of a viscous immiscible
liquid surface, where it spreads as the solvent evaporates.17 The resultant polymer film is then transferred
to a solid substrate.17 Poly(3-hexylthiophene)
films fabricated using this method showed improved electrical performance
compared with spin-coated films of the same material.7,17 But upscaling this kind of “bottom-up” method to the
assembly of polymer films with homogeneous domains of millimeter and
even larger dimensions is still a challenge.

In this perspective,
monitoring the orientation of polymer chains
on a broad range from nanometer to millimeter is of great advantage.
It will open up a way to get insight into the self-assembly mechanism
and thus provide essential information necessary for upscaling the
film fabrication. Previous investigation of self-assembled polymer
films used X-rays, electron microscopy, and force microscopy.8,9,18 However, usual X-ray scattering
and diffraction measurements are essentially bulk experiments with
low spatial resolution, whereas electron microscopy and force microscopy
provide high spatial resolution but are mostly restricted to the investigation
of sample surfaces. In contrast to these methods, optical microscopy
is easily accessible, noninvasive, and capable of providing information
on local film structures on a scale ranging from sub-micrometers to
millimeters. The structure of transparent polymer films may be studied
using dark field18 or phase contrast microscopy,
or in the case of birefringent materials, simply by imaging it in
transmitted light between a set of crossed polarizers.8,9,19,20 These methods are based on the disturbance of the light when propagating
through an inhomogeneous material, and they do not work well for very
thin polymer films of nanometer-scale thickness. By contrast, fluorescence
microscopy possesses ultimate single molecule sensitivity and is also
able to detect orientation of transition dipole moments of single
molecules and thus their orientation in space. In particular, methods
using light polarization are suited for investigating the structure
of fluorescent materials. Frequently used methods are fluorescence
anisotropy decay21 and the fluorescence-detected
linear dichroism.22 The former is suitable
for studies of isotropic samples,21,23 whereas the
latter can be used for the investigation of anisotropic polymer films.22

The recently developed two-dimensional
polarization imaging (2D
POLIM)24−26 combines the measurements of fluorescence-detected
linear dichroism and fluorescence anisotropy in one experiment and
goes beyond these two methods. This is because 2D POLIM allows investigations
of correlations between fluorescence polarization response in excitation
and in emission. Figure 1 describes the setup and its operation. In each pixel of the CCD
camera image, the fluorescence intensity I from the
sample is obtained as a 2D function I(φex, φem), which we call polarization
portrait.25,26 From each polarization portrait,
modulation depths in excitation (Mex)
and emission (Mem) are calculated from I(φex) and I(φem), respectively, as shown in Figure 1b. Thereby, omission of the other argument
of I(φex, φem)
denotes the integral over this argument. The modulation depths are
order parameters, which give the degree of orientation of the optical
transition dipole moments from isotropic (M = 0)
to uniaxial (M = 1) within the sample plane XY. The phases of fluorescence excitation θex and emission θem are the values of φex and φem that yield the intensity maxima
of I(φex) and of I(φem), respectively. They give the main angles of
orientation of the optical transition dipole moments in the sample
plane.

Figure 1 (a) 2D POLIM setup. The sample is excited using linearly polarized
light with the electric field vector oriented at an angle φex in the sample (XY) plane. Fluorescence
intensity I is detected by a camera, after passing
an analyzer oriented at an angle φem. (b) Fluorescence
images at different combinations of the angles φex and φem are acquired leading to a polarization
portrait I(φex, φem) in each pixel of the image. Modulation depth and phase of the fluorescence
excitation (Mex, θex)
and emission (Mem, θem) are obtained by integration of I(φex, φem) over φem and φex, respectively (modified from Täuber et al.).27

The direction of the transition dipole moment depends on
the direction
of the extension of the π-conjugation, which in a linear conjugated
polymer usually coincides with the polymer backbone direction.28,29 Thus, monitoring local fluorescence and fluorescence excitation
polarization properties provides information on the organization of
polymer chains.30

The polarization
portraits also contain information about the excitation
energy transfer (EET). Most commonly, EET employs Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) between spectrally different donor and acceptor
molecules (hetero-FRET).31 In this work,
we consider EET between similar chromophores (homo-FRET).31 EET can be accessed via the so-called single
funnel approximation.32 The parameter called
energy funneling efficiency (ε) was originally developed for
assessing EET in individual multichromophoric systems such as, for
example, a single conjugated polymer chain. If ε = 1, then all
excitations are funneled to a single emitting site; when ε =
0, no EET occurs and the fluorescence is emitted from the same chromophore
where it was excited originally.25,26 The single
emitting site is not necessarily a single chromophore but can be a
pool of many chromophores and therefore can have dipolar and elliptic
or isotropic character.25

2D POLIM
has been successfully applied to study films used for
organic photovoltaics.25 Here, we use 2D
POLIM to characterize the organization of a poly[2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)-quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1)33 film, which was self-assembled using the floating film transfer
method7,15,34 explained
above and is depicted in Figure 2a. TQ1 is a liquid-crystalline polymer,35 which is used as a donor in organic photovoltaics;
for chemical structure, see Figure S6.
2D POLIM reveals macroscopic millimeter-sized TQ1 domains with similar
polymer chain orientation in the liquid spread film. A local correlation
of the polarization parameters obtained using 2D POLIM allows us to
discriminate the local polymer chain orientation, which is of particular
interest in regions showing structural inhomogeneities.

Results and Discussion
Here, we
briefly explain how the film was formed during liquid
spreading before turning to the results on its organization obtained
using 2D POLIM.

Macroscopic Film Structure
The TQ1 film was obtained
by spreading a polymer solution on a liquid substrate, as depicted
schematically in Figure 2a. For further experimental details, we refer to Supporting Information, which also contains a video of the
spreading process acquired in fluorescence light. The floating film
transfer method initially was presented by Takashima and co-workers
by placing a solution droplet in the middle of a Petri dish on a liquid
substrate.7,15,16 This causes
the self-assembling polymer film to spread in two dimensions rendering
circular or elliptical film shapes.15 In
a further work, the droplet was placed at the edge of a circular-shaped
Petri dish,34 guiding the polymer film
to spread more or less in one dimension, which facilitates upscaling
for large-scale production. Here, we use liquid spreading from a straight
edge of a square Petri dish. While spreading, the TQ1 film exhibits
turns, halts, and ruptures. The evolving film structure reflects the
flow of the two liquids and the dynamic drying process. A snapshot
in the early stage of spreading is seen in Figure 2b, when the initial film split into two spreading
segments. The final shape of the part of the film adjacent to the
droplet source is seen in Figure 2c showing the video snapshot after 9 s, when the solvent
had evaporated and the spreading stopped. The film then was transferred
onto a glass substrate (see Figure 2d) for further investigation.

Investigation of
an area across the film (yellow frame in Figure 2c) perpendicular to the main spreading direction
using 2D POLIM provided information on the macroscopic polymer chain
organization in the liquid spread film, as will be discussed in the
following.

The studied area across the TQ1 film contains several
macroscopic
features. For example, at the top of the image, a bright fold appears
in the fluorescence video recording (Figure 3a), which is associated with a turn in the
main spreading direction; see the video recording of the spreading
and the snapshots in Figure S2. The area
was further investigated using 2D POLIM by taking measurements at
adjacent positions across the film. The fluorescence intensity images
(Figure 3b) obtained
using 2D POLIM show the same features as those present in the video
snapshot (Figure 3a),
whereas the preferential orientation of the polymer chains and the
degree of polarization, reporting the degree of chain alignment, can
be seen from the images of the phase angles θem (Figure 3c) and of the modulation
depths Mem (Figure 3d), respectively. Figure 3c shows that θem ranged
mainly between 60° and 120° across the TQ1 film, apart from
some small stripes. The preferential orientation of the polymer chains,
thus, was roughly perpendicular to the main spreading direction (corresponding
to 0° in our lab frame and indicated by the arrow in the video
snapshot in Figure 3a) with a deviation of up to 30°. This observation is further
supported by measurements at different positions on the film, as can
be seen in Figure S1. Perpendicular to
the spreading direction, θem changed mainly on the
scale of several tens of micrometers showing also some larger homogeneous
areas with constant θem. By contrast, along the spreading
direction, it was more or less conserved over the whole image width
corresponding to 1 mm. The small stripes showing θem ≈ 0 (parallel to the spreading direction) can be traced back
to the profile of the source droplet at the edge of the Petri dish.
When comparing this to the observation of spreading in the video,
one can see that ruptures are also likely to appear at those less
homogeneous areas of the film, which are related to an irregular shape
of the contact line at the source. For example, in the snapshot taken
after 4.4 s, a pronounced stripe can be seen, which proceeds from
the high curvature part of the edge of the source droplet; see Figure S2. Shortly afterward, a rupture appears
at this stripe, as can be seen in the next snapshot taken after 4.8
s.

Figure 3 Area across the TQ1 film perpendicular to the macroscopic spreading
direction. (a) Zoomed-in view of the video image area indicated in Figure 2c; the yellow circle
marks the area presented in Figure 5. Along this section, intensity (b), phase angle θem (c), and modulation depth Mem (d) images were obtained using 2D POLIM. Arrows in the θem image indicate preferential polymer chain orientations.

While θem reports
the local orientation of the
polymer chains, their degree of alignment can be obtained from the Mem values, as explained in the introduction.
In the studied section across the TQ1 film, Mem ranged between 0.3 and 0.7; see Figure 3d. The higher values correspond to film areas
that were formed under slow spreading velocity and/or which were exposed
to some strain during spreading, as can be seen from a comparison
with the video and with the profile of the source droplet. This observation
is further supported from the investigation of 10 different positions
along the TQ1 film; see Figure S1.

The highest degree of order and thus the maximum Mem value that can be achieved for a particular polymer
depends on its chain packing. Therefore, a high Mem is expected for highly ordered crystalline materials
and a low Mem is expected for amorphous
materials. TQ1 is liquid-crystalline up to 300°C. However, it
exhibits only a medium degree of order because the chain alignment
is sterically hindered by the alkyl side chains that restrict the
domain size of π-stacking to 4-5 TQ1 segments (∼23 Å)
and cause a twist in the polymer backbone.35 This explains the observed medium degree of polarization.

We have summarized the above detailed observation in Figure 4, showing a generalized model
of the film spreading related to the contact line geometry at the
source. The evaporation of the solvent in the source droplet leads
to an enhanced polymer concentration in the vicinity of the contact
line, similar to the well-known coffee stain effect.36,37 In this highly concentrated solution, intermolecular interactions
between the TQ1 chains become dominant over interactions with the
solvent. Because of its liquid-crystalline properties,35,38 TQ1 eventually self-organizes into a highly ordered structure, as
depicted in Figure 4a. The liquid substrate enhances mobility by allowing the solidifying
film to spread away from the source. Liquid-crystalline materials
are very sensitive to the shape of interfaces;39,40 thus, the self-organization of the TQ1 chains maps the initial curvature
of the three-phase contact line between the polymer solution, the
liquid substrate, and air, as depicted in Figure 4c. As soon as there is a solid film, there
are two contact lines separated by a film of thickness ∼30
nm; see Figure 4d.
Therefore, high curvatures along the contact line(s) induce ruptures
and stripes with a less ordered polymer chain organization, whereas
the TQ1 chains align parallel to the contact line where it is more
or less straight. We suggest that improvement of the contact line
geometry will lead to a decrease in disordered stripes and ruptures
in the film evolution.

Figure 4 Model of the film formation during liquid spreading. (a)
Enhanced
polymer concentration at the contact line induces self-organization;
(b) curvature of the contact line is conserved in the spreading film;
(c) initial formation of a three-phase contact line by solution, liquid
substrate, and air/vapor; and (d) advancing solid film forms a contact
line with the solvent and air and with the solvent and the liquid
substrate.

Besides the influence of the contact
line profile on the macroscopic
TQ1 film organization, we found the degree of polymer chain alignment Mem to depend on the spreading velocity and on
the appearance of strain due to shear forces, caused by changing directions
in the spreading film; see Figure S1b and
the associated explanations in Supporting Information. In the TQ1 film studied here, a larger Mem was observed from more slowly spread regions and from a small area
containing a double layer of the film (see Figures S1b and S2 and the description in the Supporting Information). Slow spreading occurred mainly at two occasions,
which was preceded and succeeded by faster spreading. In these two
instances, film solidification seemed to move off the liquid substrate
and up on the surface of the solvent droplet covering it partially,
thus hindering solvent evaporation. The occasional occurrence of such
features may be avoided by improved control of evaporation, spreading,
and interaction forces at the three-phase contact line.37 Enhanced polymer chain alignment points to increased
material thickness as both the degree of chain alignment and the film
thickness are related to the spreading velocity. Kaneto and co-workers
found increasing thickness from the center to the edge in their circularly
shaped polymer films produced by the floating film transfer method.15

Naturally, the film spreading depends
on macroscopic parameters
such as the substrate viscosity, the surface energies of the substrate
and the polymer solution, and on the evaporation rate of the solvent,
which may be modified by the choice of liquids and by temperature
control.15 Information about the influence
of these parameters may be found from the spreading of liquids, which
has been investigated extensively.41 A
theoretical discussion for the case of spreading a polymer film is
beyond the scope of this study. However, we experimentally investigated
the outcome for changing the substrate. For example, replacing the
ethylene glycol substrate by water prevented the formation of a complete
film; see Figure S3. In contrast to ethylene
glycol, water is polar and has a very different surface energy resulting
in a higher speed of spreading. This observation is in accordance
with the Marangoni effect, which predicts a higher
acceleration of mass, if the surface tension of the substrate is increased,
while keeping that of the spreading liquid constant.41

Moreover, it is obvious that the lateral shape of
the contact line
and the shape of its meniscus affect the structure of the formed TQ1
film. In the macroscopic approach, the contact angle is related to
the surface tensions of the involved materials by Young’s equation.42 For microscopic dimensions in the submicrometer
range, a correction term involving the line tension is commonly added
to the Young’s equation.42−44 This takes long-range interfacial
intermolecular interactions as van der Waals interactions into account,
which act on a scale up to 100 nm.45 The
situation during the spreading of liquids is more complex than for
sessile droplets on solid substrates because it is dynamic, involving
extra parameters such as viscosity.41 In
the case of the floating film transfer method, in addition to all
discussed above, one needs to consider that the solvent evaporates,
the evolving solid film proceeds from the polymer solution, and there
are two contact lines involving the polymer droplet that are separated
by a film thickness of a few tens of nanometers, which is well within
the range of intermolecular interactions.45 For such a complex situation, even an estimation of the contributions
of the various properties on the shape of the contact lines is still
far from being known. Theoretical considerations46 and a recent investigation of protein adsorption from a
solution47 show an influence of long-range
van der Waals interactions at the interfaces on the dynamics of liquids
and solutes. Because of the importance of the geometrical shape of
the molecules and electrostatic interactions for the self-arrangement
of liquid-crystalline materials in a liquid-crystal phase,38 liquid-crystalline materials are, in particular,
sensitive to long-range interactions of the material with interfaces
in confined geometries.48−50 The actual orientation of the
liquid-crystal molecules at the interface is determined by the short-range
interactions of the molecules with the interface. However, the extension
of the interfacial alignment into the bulk liquid-crystal (the so-called
anchoring strength) is influenced by the long-range interactions.38 Thus, such interactions should be also taken
into account for controlling the film formation.

Clues of the
influence from the contact line structure and long-range
interactions on the self-organization of the polymer may be derived
from the knowledge of the microscopic polymer chain organization.
Its investigation in the liquid spread film, therefore, will provide
valuable insight into the local film formation and thus contribute
to its understanding and improved control. Local correlations of fluorescence
intensity, θem, and Mem obtained using 2D POLIM allow for the discrimination of the related
polymer chain organization in the TQ1 film, as will be discussed in
the following.

Microscopic Film Structure
As can
be seen in Figure 2 and as discussed
above, the liquid spread TQ1 film shows millimeter-sized polymer domains
with similar orientation but also some folds and thin stripes. We
are interested in the microscopic polymer chain organization in both
features. Therefore, we chose an area containing a fold and a small
stripe appearing dark in the photoluminescence intensity images (indicated
by a yellow circle in Figure 3a) for further investigation by correlating the different
parameters obtained from 2D POLIM.

Figure 5 show such correlations between ε, Mem, θem, and the fluorescence intensity
along two thin cross sections within the circle indicated in Figure 3 (images in Figure 5 are rotated by 90°
to the left in comparison to Figure 3). At this position, the propagating film showed a
kink at approximately 50° to the right (main spreading direction
in the θem image changing from 150° to 200°,
whereby, 200° corresponds to 20° in the color code, as there
is no discrimination in the direction of the polarization phase between
θem and 180° + θem), and the
spreading was slightly slowed as can be seen from the video showing
the spreading and the video snapshots shown in Figure S2. This turn in the main spreading direction caused
the polymer chains in the large homogeneous parts of the studied area
to change from a perpendicular orientation in respect to the direction
of spreading (dark yellow color corresponding to 100°). In the
homogeneous area along an investigated spread film section with no
bends (Figure S4), the polymer chains aligned
perpendicular to the spreading direction. The observed general turn
of the polymer chains in Figure 5, thus, can be related to some strain forces causing
the macroscopic kink. For further information on the local chain alignment,
we correlated the parameters obtained using 2D POLIM along two 10-pixel-wide
cross sections indicated by blue lines in the θem image (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 Correlations
between ε, θem, Mem, and fluorescence intensity within the area highlighted
in Figure 3. 1 pix
= 2.6 μm. (a) θem image; macroscopic liquid
spreading direction and phase angles at particular positions are marked
by blue arrows. (b,c) Correlations of ε, Mem, θem, and fluorescence intensity along
cross sections indicated by blue lines in the θem image. (d–f) Images of ε (d), Mem (e), and fluorescence intensity (f) from the same area as
shown in the θem image (a).

To understand the implications of the structure of the three-phase
contact line on the polymer self-organization, deviations from the
rather homogeneous film structure are of particular interest. One
about 100 μm (∼40 pix) wide feature exhibiting a strong
intensity decrease compared with the remaining film area can be seen
in the right part of the fluorescence intensity image (f). In the
cross section in Figure 5b, it appears for 340 < x < 370 pix, indicated
by vertical arrows. In general, an intensity drop could be caused
by a thinner material. At the left edge (x ≈
330 pix), the decrease in intensity is accompanied by an increase
in ordering (increased Mem). The latter
rather points to a more dense material because the self-ordering properties
of the liquid-crystalline TQ135 will yield
improved polymer chain alignment in thicker areas rather than in thinner
ones. Another feature leading to an intensity decrease could be an
out-of-plane turn of the polymer backbones. In that case, their optical
transition dipoles are no longer oriented in the plane of the electric
vector of the exciting light, causing a smaller absorption of the
latter. Similarly, a smaller portion of their fluorescence emission
will be collected by the objective (of relatively small NA), which
altogether causes a decrease in intensity as well. Thus, the most
likely explanation here is that the dark stripe is caused by an out-of-plane
ordering of the polymer chains (turning from the x–y plane into the x–z-plane, as depicted in Figure 6). This orientation is kept throughout the
dark stripe. Only at the right edge (x ≈ 370
pix), there is a profound drop in Mem (from
0.4 to 0.2). This feature, which is related to a decrease in the polymer
chain ordering, can be associated with looser packing and thus can
point to a thinner material. The drop in Mem is observed at the edge of the dark stripe, where the intensity
increases again and also θem is turning fast in this
location.

Figure 6 Model of the TQ1 film structure in the region 300 < x < 400 pix (300 pix set to 0 mm; 100 pix = 0.26 mm)
along the dashed line in Figure 5a. (a) Measured fluorescence intensity; (b) structure
modeled in the side view; (c) view from the top; and (d) experimental Mem. Red arrows in the top view (c) indicate
the main spreading direction. TQ1 chains are depicted as rods (not
to scale), where the rod length illustrates the projection of the
chains onto the image plane XY. The grayscale of
background marks high (bright) and low (dark) fluorescence intensities.

Further support of a less dense
polymer structure in this kind
of collision zone at x ≈ 370 pix comes from
the investigation of the energy funneling efficiency ε because
the EET between two chromophores strongly depends on their intermolecular
distance.31 The dip of ε from 0.8
to 0.7 at x ≈ 370 pix, thus, points to an
increased average intermolecular distance and to a less dense material.

Apart from the stripes with fast changing θem,
the TQ1 film also exhibits some folds, for example, at the top edge
in Figure 3, where
the film shows a kink. Part of this fold is crossed by the dotted
blue line in Figure 5a. As can be seen from the correlations of the 2D POLIM parameters
for this cross section in Figure 5c, the pronounced increase in intensity (30 < x < 60 pix) is accompanied by a very small variation
in θem and no noticeable change in Mem and ε. This points to a formation of the folds
from the already solidified film, in contrast to the previously discussed
stripes with changing orientation of the polymer chains. On the one
hand, further improvement of the liquid spreading method has to deal
with shear forces acting in the vicinity of the three-phase contact
line, whereas on the other hand, deformation and folding of the freshly
formed film have to be avoided.

A possible way to improve the
method is to manipulate the shape
of the source droplet. This could be achieved by implementing a rectangular
tip or an array of tips for inserting the polymer solution, as depicted
in Figure 7. Furthermore,
the film structure would prosper from a constant spreading speed.
As the spreading speed is related to the solvent evaporation and the
polymer concentration in the source, we suggest to connect the tip
with a reservoir of the polymer solution for avoiding changes in the
polymer concentration in the source. This of course has an impact
on the requirements for solvent viscosity, as is well-known from inkjet
printing.51,52 On the other hand, the film formation is
related to the evaporation speed of the solvent. To cope for a more
viscous and thus a less volatile solvent, a suitable laminar flow
of the liquid substrate may be induced in the vessel or the tip may
be moved. However, a specific investigation of the suitable parameters
for the suggested kind of device here is beyond the scope of this
study because it requires a thorough evaluation, similar to finding
such parameters for inkjet printing.51,52 Nevertheless,
the structural information about the film formation found using 2D
POLIM may be used for guiding this search.

Figure 7 Suggestions for further
improvement of the floating film transfer
method.

Experiment
Film Preparation
Poly[2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1; for chemical structure see Figure S6) was synthesized as described previously.33 For the film preparation, we slightly modified
the floating film transfer method introduced by Kaneto and co-workers:7,15 TQ1 was dissolved in chloroform with a concentration of 10 mg/mL
at room temperature. For the liquid substrate, we used ethylene glycol
placed in a square Petri dish. A 5 μL droplet of this TQ1 solution
was injected into the contact line formed by ethylene glycol at the
inner wall of the Petri dish; see schematic depiction in Figure 1a. Both the injection
of the solution droplet and
the subsequent film spreading were video recorded. The spread film
was picked up horizontally by a glass slide and kept in a vacuum chamber
overnight to ensure evaporation of any remaining solvent. Finally,
the TQ1 film was annealed for 5 min at 100°C. The film thickness
was determined to be about 30 nm using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Video Record
For
the video recording (see the file
in Supporting Information), the sample
was uniformly illuminated by blue light from a home-built LED array
illuminator. The video was recorded with a Nikon D3100 camera, using
a Nikon 105 mm f/2.8G lens for focusing onto the surface of the ethylene
glycol substrate. The reflected excitation light was blocked by a
longpass filter (650 nm). Thus, the video shows the fluorescence emission
from the spreading polymer film.

2D POLIM Setup
For 2D POLIM microscopy, we used a home-built
2D POLIM setup based on a commercial widefield microscope (Olympus
IX 71, Japan), which is described in detail elsewhere.25,26 The setup combines motorized rotation of the polarization phase
of the linear excitation (φex) and the polarization
phase of the detected emission (φem), synchronized
by a Labview program that also controls the acquisition via an EMCCD
camera (PhotonMax 512, Princeton Instruments, US).25 For this study, samples were excited using the 488 nm line
of an Ar-ion laser (177-G02, Spectra-Physics, US) and a dry 4×
objective (Olympus Plan N, NA = 0.1). The excitation light was blocked
from detection using two long-pass filters, with transmission edges
at 572 (HQ572lp) and 695 nm (E695lp) (all from Chroma Technology Corp.,
US). Excitation power was 0.1 W/cm2.

Conclusions
The formation of highly ordered films of conjugated polymers from
solvents can be evaluated using the fluorescence polarization imaging
method. The floating film transfer method7,15 was
used for the self-assembly of a polymer film by the deposition of
a TQ1 solution droplet into the meniscus formed at the contact of
a liquid substrate with the straight edge of a square Petri dish.
Spreading of the solution from that edge occurs in one direction.
For the first time, we correlate the dynamics of the film formation,
as seen from a fluorescence image video recording, with the film structure
revealed by the powerful 2D POLIM.

The self-organization of
the liquid-crystalline polymer TQ1 during
evaporation with the simultaneous flow of polymer chains on a liquid
substrate indicates the important role of the geometry of the three-phase
contact line and of the meniscus of the solution with solute on the
top of a liquid substrate. For simple geometries, the polymer chains
align in the transverse direction to the flow of solution; this can
be modified when the contact line is strongly curved, where an orientational
disorder is obtained. Areas of aligned polymer chains can reach millimeter-size
under the simple experiments reported here.

Local correlations
of fluorescence intensity, polarization phase
θem, modulation depth Mem and energy funneling efficiency ε derived by 2D POLIM yield
further information on the film microstructure. Apart from large homogeneously
oriented areas of the film, we found up to 100 μm wide stripes
exhibiting an out-of-plane ordering of the polymer chains accompanied
at one edge by a smaller region of disordered chains. These features
resemble collision zones, resulting from the exertion of shear forces
in the vicinity of the contact line. Modeling such features as a result
from shear forces exceeding the intermolecular forces responsible
for the polymer self-organization may yield further insight into the
process of film formation and thus guiding further improvement and
upscaling of this promising method.
