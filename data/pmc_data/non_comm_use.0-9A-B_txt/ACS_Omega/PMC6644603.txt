Finding
new methods of carbon–carbon bond formation is a
key goal in expanding current methodology for heterocycle formation.
Because of their inherently nonplanar shape, new methods of forming
sp3-rich scaffolds are of particular importance. Although
there are methods for combining heterocyclization and formation of
new sp3–sp3 carbon–carbon bonds,
these form the carbon–heteroatom bond rather than a carbon–carbon
bond of the heterocycle. Here, we show a new alkene arylallylation
reaction that generates a heterocycle with concomitant formation of
two new carbon–carbon bonds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
this process occurs through an isohypsic (redox neutral) mechanism.
Overall, this carboallylation reaction gives a new route to the synthesis
of 3,3-disubstituted heterocycles.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heterocycles
are found in a vast array of biologically active molecules
and complex natural products. Consequently, many synthetic strategies
have evolved to access these motifs.1 Palladium-catalyzed
methods are among the most widely used, due to the versatility and
functional group tolerance of these cycles.2 Most Pd-catalyzed heterocycle forming reactions take advantage of
the nucleophilicity of the heteroatom as a key feature of the overall
process. For example, we have previously shown that difunctionalisation
of alkenes by heteroallylation can be used to generate a range of
O- and N-containing heterocycles (Figure 1a).3 A lesser-used
set of reactions utilizes starting materials where the carbon–heteroatom
bonds are already in place.4 For example,
Pd-promoted cyclization of aryl bromide 3, followed by
Sonogashira–type coupling affords oxindole 4 (Figure 1b).5

Figure 1 Examples of Pd-catalyzed heterocycle formation and our plan for
a new synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted heterocycles.

The inclusion of more sp3-hybridized
carbons in medicinal
chemistry programmes has been shown to correlate to increased clinical
success.6 As a complement to our earlier
alkene heteroallylation work that generates heterocycles substituted
with a new C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond at the
2 position (Figure 1a), we became interested in developing a Pd-catalyzed synthesis of
3,3-disubstituted heterocycles with accompanying C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond formation (Figure 1c). The success of this transformation would provide
a new potential strategy to access complex biologically active compounds,
such as the nM norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor daledalin, or the
neurokinin receptor antagonist 7 (Figure 2).7

Figure 2 Biologically
active 3,3-disubstituted heterocycles.

A single literature report describes Pd-catalyzed heterocycle
synthesis
from aryl boronic acids (8 → 9, Scheme 1).8 This process
likely proceeds through a Pd(0)–Pd(II) catalytic cycle, including
β-hydride elimination and reoxidation of the Pd by oxygen. On
the basis of this precedent as well as our experience on developing
an isohypsic (redox neutral) heteroallylation of alkenes (Figure 1a), we set out to
develop an alkene carboallylation reaction that would generate 3,3-disubstituted
heterocycles with concomitant sp3–sp3 C–C bond formation (Figure 1c).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Optimization
An
initial attempt at
carboallylation was carried out using conditions similar to the heteroallylation
(Table 1). Pleasingly,
this resulted in formation of the desired dihydrobenzofuran 11, albeit as a minor component, with the main products being
that of direct allylation 12 and deboronation 13 (entry 1). A change of the allyl halide from bromide to chloride
resulted in decreased formation of the deboronation product 13 (entry 2). Lowering the number of the equivalents of allyl
chloride caused an improvement in the ratio of 11:12, although the formation of 13 was also increased
(entries 3 and 4). Continuing with 2 equivalents of allyl chloride,
the effect of the catalyst system was examined (Table 2). The use of phosphine ligands proved detrimental,
with none of the desired product formed (entries 2 and 3). Palladium(II)
catalyst PdCl2 led to the slightly decreased formation
of the desired product, along with lower formation of deboronation
product 13 (entry 4), whereas palladium(0) catalysts
did not result in formation of the desired product (entries 5–7).
The use of phosphonite catalyst 14(9) resulted in an improved ratio between the desired and direct
coupling products, but use of this catalyst was discontinued because
of the formation of several additional unidentified side products
(entry 8).

a In addition to 11 and 13, several
additional side products were observed by 1H NMR.

Moving from an aqueous base to a
solid base greatly improved the
ratio between 11:12 (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). Use of other solid bases,
such as sodium hydroxide or cesium fluoride, caused lower or zero
conversion to the desired product (entries 3 and 4). Use of organic
bases, such as triethylamine, also resulted in formation of the desired
product as a minor component (entry 5).

a Bases used as solids.

Next, the choice of solvent
was examined (Table 4). Use of dimethylformamide (DMF) showed
no conversion to the desired product, with the only product being
that of direct allylation (entry 2). Acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) not only lowered the formation of the deboronated product but
also resulted in the formation of less desired product (entries 3
and 4). Use of dimethoxyethane completely suppressed the formation
of the deboronated product, although overall conversion was lowered
(entry 5).

Carrying these conditions forward,
the choice of boron reagent
was examined (Table 5). Pinacol boronate ester proved ineffective, with only a small amount
of the desired product formed, with direct allylation product 12 being the major result (entry 2). N-methyliminodiacetic
acid (MIDA) boronate showed very low conversion, with the only product
formed that of direct allylation (entry 3). Potassium trifluoroborate 15, however, gave full conversion of the starting material
while maintaining the ratio of desired/direct allylated products,
forming the desired dihydrobenzofuran in 48% isolated yield (entry
4).

a 48% isolated yield.

2.2 Reaction Scope
As the competition
between desired 11 and direct coupling 12 products involves a cyclization step, the “reactive rotomer”
effect10 can have an important influence
on product ratio (Scheme 2). After transmetallation to form Pd(II) intermediate 16, the proximity of the O-methallyl chain
determines how easily direct coupling or cyclization can occur. For
cyclization to occur, the O-methallyl chain must
be in close proximity to the Pd(II). As it is less sterically favorable
for the O-methallyl chain to be close to the Pd(II)
(conformer 16′), it will likely spend more time
at a greater distance (conformer 17). This leaves the
Pd(II) intermediate 16 more vulnerable to direct coupling.
By replacing the hydrogen in the 3-position with another group, orientation
of the O-methallyl chain toward the 3-position should
become less favorable. This should result in the equilibrium being
displaced toward 16′, therefore favoring cyclization.

Scheme 2 Reactive Rotomer Effect on Carboallylation
To this end, the carboallylation conditions were applied
to methyl-substituted
potassium trifluoroborate 18 (Scheme 3). As predicted, the formation of direct
allylation product 20 was greatly suppressed, with only
a trace amount detected. The desired dihydrobenzofuran 19 was formed in 46% isolated yield.

Scheme 3 Carboallylation of
Methyl-Substituted 18
During the development of their palladium-catalyzed cyclization
of aryl halides, Zhou et al. also observed competition between cyclization
and direct alkynylation.5 The direct alkynylation
process could be largely suppressed by using N-methylmethacrylamides,
as shown in Figure 1b. We thus employed N-methylmethacrylamide 22 (Scheme 4) as a boron analog of the aryl halide substrates used by Zhou et
al. Pleasingly, the carboallylation conditions were successfully resulted
in formation of oxindoline 23 in 47% yield, with only
trace amounts of direct allylation product 24 formed.

Scheme 4 Carboallylation of Methylmethacrylamide 22
2.3 Mechanistic
Study
To examine the
mechanism of the arylallylation process, a deuterium-labeling study
was carried out. The heterocycle formation was carried out using aryltrifluoroborate 15 using dideuteroallyl bromide (Scheme 5). This resulted in the formation of dihydrobenzofuran 25 as a single deuterated isomer, and direct allylation products 26a and 26b as a 1:1 mixture of deuterated isomers
(in 21 and 1% isolated yields, respectively).

Scheme 5 Product Distribution
of Carboallylation Using Deuterium-Labeled Allyl
Bromide
This is consistent
with an isohypsic mechanism for the formation
of 25 (Scheme 6). Beginning with transmetallation of boronic acid 10, palladium(II) intermediate 16 is formed. Carbopalladation
(olefin insertion) forms the C–C bond of the dihydrobenzofuran
ring, giving 27. A second carbopalladation can then occur,
this time onto the allyl halide double bond giving palladium(II) intermediate 28. Finally, β-halide elimination gives the dihydrobenzofuran
product 25 as a single deuterated isomer, and releases
the palladium(II) catalyst.

Scheme 6 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation
of 25
However, an isohypsic mechanism is not consistent with
the formation
of a 1:1 mixture of deuterated isomers of the direct allylation products 26a/b. This suggests that the direct allylation
products are formed via an alternative mechanism. Beginning with oxidative
addition of palladium(0) into the allyl halide, π-allyl palladium(II)
species 29a/b are formed (Scheme 7). Transmetallation of boronic
acid 10 gives rise to palladium(II) intermediates 30a/b. Finally, reductive elimination forms the
direct allylated products 26a/b and reforms
the palladium(0) catalyst.

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of 26a/b
As the dihydrobenzofuran and direct allylation products
appear
to be formed by separate mechanisms, it should be possible to control,
which product is formed by controlling the catalyst used. Having already
shown the use of a palladium(II) catalyst to form a dihydrobenzofuran
product from potassium trifluoroborate 15 (Table 5, entry 4), we chose to treat 15 with a Pd(0) catalyst. As predicted, exposure of 15 to Pd2dba3 and allyl chloride resulted
in the sole formation of direct coupling product 12 (Scheme 8).11 Interestingly, use of several common oxidants, such as
benzoquinone, DDQ, O2, or Cu(II), did not favor the isohypsic
cyclization process.

Scheme 8 Selective Formation of Direct Coupling Product 12
3 Conclusions
We have developed a new Pd-catalyzed arylallylation reaction of
alkenes. This reaction has been demonstrated in the formation of heterocycles,
such as dihydrobenzofurans and oxindolines, results in formation of
two new carbon–carbon bonds, and generates a quaternary carbon
center. After elimination of the deboronation side product and suppression
of the direct coupling product, the arylallylation reaction was shown
to proceed through an isohypsic palladium(II)-catalyzed mechanism.
By controlling the reaction conditions, selective formation of either
the cyclized or direct allylated product is possible.
