An ambient cross-linking
system based on the Knoevenagel condensation
reaction between acetoacetylated sucrose and aromatic dicarboxaldehydes
was demonstrated. In this study, we use a rheological instrument to
measure the gel time to predict and elucidate the likely reaction
mechanism of the system, and we prepare films based on the mechanistic
results. Acetoacetylated sucrose and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
were used as raw materials, piperidine was used as the catalyst, and
nonvolatile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent. After
mixing 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde and piperidine for 30
min, the acetoacetylated sucrose was added, thus producing the shortest
gel time. Then, the gel was characterized by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy. In addition, three films were prepared by this approach
with different aromatic dicarboxaldehydes, and the properties of the
coatings were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter,
dynamic mechanical analysis thermogravimetric analysis, and swelling
ratio. It was found that these films have high Young’s modulus,
high glass transition temperatures, high pencil hardnesses, and low
swelling ratios.

==== Body
Introduction
Since the Knoevenagel condensation reaction
was first reported
by Emil Knoevenagel in 1894,1 the Knoevenagel
condensation reaction has been increasingly used and has become an
important C–C bond formation reaction.2−5 It has been used to obtain a variety
of compounds, such as synthetic natural products,6 drugs,7 fine chemicals,8 functional polymer materials,9 and so forth.

In a Knoevenagel condensation reaction,
in the dehydration condensation
of compounds, compounds containing active methylene groups is used
with aldehydes or ketones under weak base catalysis to produce α,
β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their analogues.10 Currently, the following two kinds of mechanisms
consistent with the Knoevenagel condensation reaction are known (Scheme 1): in the first mechanism,
aldehyde compounds are first combined with catalysts and then react
with acetylacetate to form an addition product, as was first proposed
by Emil Knoevenagel11(Scheme 1a); in the second mechanism,
the catalyst first reacts with acetyl acetate and then attacks the
aldehyde to obtain an addition product12 (Scheme 1b). These
two mechanisms are the subject of some agreement, but theoretical
investigations of the mechanism of the Knoevenagel condensation reaction
have been rare.13,14 The Knoevenagel condensation
reaction is a good cross-linking method because it can be carried
out at room temperature with a high yield. Therefore, it is widely
used in the synthesis of polymer materials, such as fluorescent materials,15 conductive polymer materials,16 and coatings.17

Paint has become
an indispensable material for our society.18 However, the production of paint is still based
on petrochemical products. With the increasing importance of environmental
issues, the need for sustainable resources and new approaches has
gradually increased. As a renewable resource, sucrose is cheap, easily
available, and has multiple hydroxyl groups, and it can be modified
to produce a large number of coatings such as epoxy coatings,19 polyurethane coatings,20 and UV curing coatings.21 However, there
has been only one report in the literature on the preparation of the
acetoacetylated sucrose coating which was used for the preparation
of the coating for acetoacetylated sucrose and diamine.22 Recently, our group23 reported a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between plant groups
and aromatic dicarboxaldehydes, but the possible reaction mechanism
of the system was not studied.

In this work, we used the gel
time to study the possible mechanism
for the reaction between acetoacetylated sucrose and aromatic dicarboxaldehydes
via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction at room temperature (25
°C) and elucidated the likely mechanism of the reaction. We then
used this mechanism as guidance in the study of the coating properties.

Results
and Discussion
NMR Characterization of Acetoacetylated Sucrose
The
structure of acetoacetylated sucrose was confirmed based on the results
of its 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral analyses. Figure 1a shows the 1H NMR spectra of the acetoacetylated peaks at 3.58–3.54
and 2.29–2.24 ppm, while the 13C NMR spectra of
acetoacetylated sucrose show peaks at 199, 165, 48, and 20 ppm24 (Figure 1b). In addition, a significant decrease in the absorbance
at 3380 cm–1 (−OH stretching frequency) and
in the stretching vibration band of C=O of −COCH2COCH3 at 1746 and 1704 cm–1 is
observed in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 2). These results demonstrate
that sucrose and t-butyl acetylacetate undergoes
a transesterification reaction.

Characterization of Gel
Time
Figure 3 and Table 1 show
the different gel times of the system for different
orders of the addition of acetoacetylated sucrose, 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde,
and piperidine in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. At the gel
point, the storage modulus (G′) is equal to
the loss modulus (G″), and the viscosity (η)
increases dramatically. As observed from Figure 3 and Table 1, after mixing 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
(B) with the catalyst piperidine (C) for 30 min prior to adding the
mixture to acetoacetylated sucrose (A), the gel time is the shortest
(Figure 3b and Table 1, entry 1). When acetoacetylated
sucrose (A) and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (B) are mixed
for 30 min prior to the addition of piperidine (C) for the cross-linking
system of the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, an intermediate gel
time was obtained (Figure 3c and Table 1, entry 2). When acetoacetylated sucrose (A) was mixed with piperidine
(C) for 30 min prior to adding the mixture to the 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
(B), the gel time was the longest25 (Figure 3d and Table 1, entry 3). The rheological
complex viscosity results also prove that mixing 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
(B) with the catalyst piperidine (C) followed by the addition of the
mixture to the acetoacetylated sucrose (A) obtains the shortest gel
time.26

An examination of the
gel time data indicates that the mechanism
of the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of acetoacetylated sucrose
and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde under the piperidine catalyst
may involve the reaction of piperidine with 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde,
followed by the reaction with acetoacetylated sucrose. The likely
mechanism of this reaction is the mechanism proposed by Knoevenagel
in Scheme 1a.

The FTIR spectra of acetoacetylated sucrose, 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde,
and the gel after reaction are shown in Figure 4. Significant peaks due to the −CHO
stretching frequency at 2828 and 2753 cm–1 were
observed to decrease after cross-linking, and the insoluble material
showed the characteristic absorption peaks of benzene rings at 1510
and 1380 cm–1; these results indicate that the acetoacetylated
sucrose has reacted with 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde.23,27

Characterization of the Films
After exploring the reaction
mechanism by rheological testing, we prepared the coating using the
optimum cross-linking time. According to the above-mentioned cross-linking
system, as shown in Table 2, volatile THF was used as the solvent, and 4,4-biphenylboxaldehyde
and piperidine (10 wt %) were mixed for 30 min; then, this mixture
was added to the acetoacetylated sucrose to cure the film. We found
that this system produced many insoluble substances after 10 min,
but this method cannot form a uniform membrane. The main reason for
this may be that the amount of catalyst is too large and the system
cured too fast. When we add the mixture to the piperidine in 2.5 wt
%, the film could be cured in 3 h, and the film was retracted and
could not form a flat membrane. Encouraged by this result, we further
decreased the catalyst amount and found that 1 wt % of piperidine
resulted in the best performance with the curing time of 5 h and gel
content of 96%.

FTIR
spectra of acetoacetylated sucrose, an acetone-swollen substance
after curing (P1) and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde are shown
in Figure 5. A comparison
with Figure 1 shows
that the cross-linked insoluble material and the film insoluble material
were similar. Both showed the −CHO stretching frequency decreases
at 2828 and 2752 cm–1, and for both, the benzene
ring peaks at 1510 and 1380 cm–1 were produced.23,27 In summary, we have successfully prepared films using a Knoevenagel
reaction of acetoacetylated sucrose and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde.

Figure 5 FTIR characterization
of acetoacetylated sucrose, P1, and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde.

Under the above optimized conditions, we used 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde,
isophthalaldehyde, or 1,4-phthalaldehyde as cross-linkers (P1, P2,
and P3, respectively) to prepare three films (Table 3). The characterization data for these three
films are presented in Table 3. The pencil hardness values of these coatings range between
4 and 5 H, and the pendulum hardness values were between 33.1 and
41.2 s. The swelling ratios in acetone were between 17 and 22%, and
the gel content ranged from 91 to 96%.

Cross-link Density Analysis
The cross-link density
and the cross-link molecular weight Mc of these films were calculated by the Flory–Rehner equation,28,29 and the results are shown in Table 4. It could be seen that the cross-link molecular weight
increased gradually from 7579 to 18 425 g/mol, while the cross-link
density of these films was reduced from 1.702 to 0.691 mol/cm.3 This was due to the steric hindrance of benzene
rings.

Dynamic Mechanical
Analysis
The stress–strain
behaviors of these coating films are shown in Figure 6 and Table 5. Compared to P1, P2, and P3, it is obviously seen
that three films have higher Young’s modulus and the film of
P1, the best extension ratio. The main reason may be, that is, the
high cross-linking density of P1.

Differential
Scanning Calorimeter Analysis
The glass-transition
temperatures (Tg) were obtained from the
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves, as shown in Figure 7 and Table 5. Three films have higher glass-transition
temperature and their Tg values were in
the 71–79 °C range. The main reason for this result is
the high cross-linking density of P1.30

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Figure 8a shows
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
curves for three films; the DTGA curve is presented in Figure 8b, and the T10, T50, and Tmax data are summarized in Table 5. Based on Figure 8a, two distinct degradation stages were observed
for all three films. The degradation at the first stage in the range
of 169–320 °C can be attributed to the dissociation of
the modified ester bonds and carbon groups to form CO2.
At the second stage, when the temperature reaches 350 °C, the
polymer skeleton is obtained.31 According
to the Table 5, the T10, T50, and Tmax decomposition temperatures of the three
films were similar.

Solvent Swelling
Figure 9 shows the
swelling ratio of the three films. After
soaking for 30 h, the film swelling ratio reached the maximum values.
Compared with the swelling ratio of the three coatings, P1 has the
largest swelling ratio and P3 has the smallest swelling ratio. This
result may be obtained because the aromatic dicarboxaldehyde cross-linking
agent has the longest chain in the P1 structure.32

Conclusions
An ambient cross-linking system of acetoacetylated
sucrose and
aromatic dicarboxaldehydes was demonstrated. The possible mechanism
for the synthesis of this system was explored by the rheological evaluation
of gel time measurements. It was determined that the shortest gel
time was obtained during the mixing of aromatic dicarboxaldehydes
and the catalyst (piperidine) for 30 min, which was followed by the
addition of acetoacetylated sucrose. In addition, three films were
prepared by the procedure with the shortest gel time, and it was found
that the films have high Young’s modulus, higher glass transition
temperature, higher hardness, and lower acetone swelling ratio.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Sucrose, 1,4-phthalaldehyde, 1,3-benzenedialdehyde, t-butylacetoacetate, and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, China. Piperidine dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Works. All the materials were used as obtained without further purification.
The water used in this study was deionized and doubly distilled.

Preparation of Acetoacetylated Sucrose
The synthesis
of acetoacetylated sucrose was carried out according to a previously
reported study,24 and the detailed synthesis
method was as follows (Scheme 2). In a 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic
stir bar and a condenser, a mixture of sucrose (40 g, 0.0538 mol)
and t-butylacetoacetate (147.7 g, 0.936 mol) was
stirred at 130 °C for 3 h, and the mixing was stopped when no
more liquid evolved. Finally, 63 mL of the liquid was removed, and
a yellow oil was obtained. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400

1.20.

Scheme 2 Preparation of Acetoacetylated Sucrose
Gel Time Study Using a Rheometer
Two sample bottles
(30 × 50 mm) were used to study the gel time. Acetoacetylated
sucrose (A, 0.25 g, 0.247 mmol) and DMSO (1.5 mL) were added to the
first bottle, and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (B, 0.156 g,
0.743 mmol) and DMSO (2.5 mL) were added to the second bottle for
backup; the ratio of acetoacetylated sucrose and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
was 1:0.75, which was based on our previous report.

(BC-A)
Piperidine (52.5 μL, 0.478 mmol) was added
to the dissolved sample bottle of 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde
(B) for 30 min; then, the dissolved acetoacetylated sucrose (A) was
mixed by stirring for 2 min. Afterward, the mixing solution (20 drops)
was added to the rheometer plate.

(AB-C)
The solution
of acetoacetylated sucrose (A)
and 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (B) was mixed for 30 min,
and piperidine (52.5 μL, 0.478 mmol) was added with stirring
for 2 min. Then, the mixing solution (20 drops) was added to the rheometer
plate.

(AC-B)
Piperidine (52.5 μL, 0.478 mmol) was added
to the dissolved sample bottle of acetoacetylated sucrose (A) for
30 min, and the dissolved 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (B)
was mixed by stirring for 2 min. Then, the mixing solution (20 drops)
was added to the rheometer plate.

The viscosity of the cross-linking
system is used to determine the gel time. Parallel plate geometry
was used and the gap between the plates was set to 400 μm. For
the viscosity measurements, the sample shear rate was 10 rad/s, and
the average values of three measurements of storage modulus, loss
modulus, and viscosity monitored at room temperature (25 °C)
were reported. The gel time was set as the time when the storage modulus
was equal to the loss modulus or when the viscosity increased dramatically.

Coating Formulation
The method used for the preparation
of the films is described in Scheme 3 and Table 6, and the detailed experimental procedure was as follows:
aromatic dicarboxaldehydes (2.958 mmol) and piperidine (1 wt %) were
dissolved in THF (5 mL), and after mixing for half an hour, acetoacetylated
sucrose (1 g, 0.986 mmol) was added to the mixture. Then, the mixture
was stirred for 15 min and poured into a poly (tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) mould (8 cm × 8 cm × ss1.5 cm); then, the films were
cured at ambient temperature to obtain a dry film (100–200
microns thick).

Coating Characterization
The viscosity
of acetoacetylated
sucrose was determined using a TA Discovery HR-2 rheometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker
AV-400NMR instrument using tetramethyl silane as the internal reference.
FT-IR spectra were obtained using a Bruker-Veretex70 spectrometer
in the attenuated total reflection mode with the reported values obtained
as averages of 32 scans for each sample in the 4000–500 cm–1 range. The drying times of the coatings were determined
using a BK drying recorder, and the results were analyzed according
to the ASTM D5895-2013 standard. The pencil hardness was measured
according to the ASTM D3363 protocol. The pendulum hardness of these
films was tested using an ASTM D4366 pendulum hardness tester (Sheen
Instrument Ltd., UK).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
employed a TA Instruments calorimeter (TA-Q200). The sample of films
which at nitrogen atmosphere underwent the temperature raised from
−60 to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.

TGA was
performed using a TGA-Q50 system obtained from TA Instruments
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under a N2 atmosphere.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed
on a TA Instruments
Q800 (New Castle, DE). A compression force of 3 N and a deformation
of 5% were applied.

The gel content was measured by immersion
of a film (2 cm ×
2 cm pieces) with a known weight (W1);
then, the dried film was dipped in acetone for 48 h and dehydrated
for 48 h at 60 °C to obtain weight W2, and the gel content M was assessed according to
the eq 1 1  

Acetone swelling was performed by the immersion
of a film with
a known weight (W1) in an acetone bath,
after which the towel-dried sample weight (W2) and the oven-dried sample weight (W1) were obtained; then, the acetone swelling (M %; amount of acetone absorbed by the film) of the films was calculated
according to the eq 2 2  

The cross-link density (ve) of the
films was obtained by calculating the volume fraction of the swollen
polymer with eq 3 by
the Flory–Rehner relation33,34 3  where ve is the
cross-link density, V2 is the volume fraction
of the polymer in the swollen specimen, Vs is the molar volume of the solvent, χ is the interaction parameter
between the polymer and the solvent, and Mc is the relative average molecular weight of the polymer.

The V2 from eq 1 can be calculated according to eq 4 4  where ρ1 and ρ2 are the densities of the solvent
and the polymer, respectively.

The interaction parameter (χ)
between the polymer and the
solvent was determined by eq 3 5  where R is the gas
constant
and T is the absolute temperature. δs and δp were the solvent and the solubility parameters
of the polymer, respectively. The solubility parameter δp of the polymer could be determined by the swelling method.35
