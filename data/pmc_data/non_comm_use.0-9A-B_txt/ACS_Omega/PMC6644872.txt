Preparation
of metal-halide perovskites under room temperature
attracts attention because of energy saving by removing thermal annealing.
Room-temperature transformation of spin-cast wet films consisting
of methylammonium (MA) iodide, PbI2, and dimethylformamide
toward solid MAPbI3 perovskite proceeds via several intermediate
crystalline states and is strongly dependent on ambient humidity.
Light transmission and photoluminescence (PL) microscopy and spectroscopy
were used to monitor the growth of crystals and transformation of
their properties in time under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.
Under low humidity, a highly luminescent intermediate phase with low
absorption in the visible range appears, with the PL spectra composed
of several bands in the range from 600 to 760 nm. We assign these
bands to low-dimensional (nanocrystals and two-dimensional inclusions)
MAPbI3 intermediates, where the exciton confinement shifts
the spectrum to higher energies in comparison with the bulk MAPbI3. The intermediate levels of ambient humidity (10–50%)
appear to catalyze the conversion of the intermediate phase to MAPbI3. At a high ambient humidity (>80%), the initially formed
MAPbI3 is quickly transformed to the transparent hydrate
phase of MAPbI3. The role of ambient water catalyzing the
material transformation by competing for Pb coordination with the
solvent molecules is discussed.

1 Introduction
As
a typical representative of organic–inorganic hybrid
perovskite semiconductors, methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite
(CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3)
has attracted lots of attention in the material science community
because of its high performance as an active material for solar cells
and light-emitting diodes.1−5 One of the biggest advantages with MAPbI3 and other similar
perovskites is that they can be solution-processed. MAPbI3 thin films can be prepared using many different techniques including
one-step6−9 and two-step depositions,10−13 as well as more complicated methods like, for example,
chemical vapor deposition.14−17 However, thermal annealing of the film is usually
required for most of the existing techniques today as the final synthesis
step to remove solvent molecules from the structure. To reduce the
energy cost of the preparation process, much attention has been given
to the preparation of the perovskite film at room temperature by the
solvent–solvent extraction or solid–gas interaction
process, which has been proven to yield high-performance solar cells.18−21 Another key factor for the preparation of the perovskite film is
the humidity of the environment, which is often considered detrimental
for the stability of perovskite films.22−25 For this reason, film preparation
inside a glovebox is always required to minimize the side effects
of H2O in the atmosphere. However, it was shown that even
without a glovebox, if the humidity is well-controlled within the
range of 30–50%, it is possible to prepare high-quality films
with a large grain size of perovskite crystals.26−28 The synthesis
of MAPbI3 under higher controlled ambient humidity was
shown to exhibit less favorable morphology, yet higher photoluminescence
(PL) quantum yield.29 It was also demonstrated
that water vapor annealing at room temperature can help to achieve
high-performance perovskite solar cells.30 To summarize, there are many factors influencing the material quality
and hence the optoelectronic properties during synthesis. However,
the influence of most of the factors is just empirical knowledge lacking
real understanding. The interaction between water and perovskite materials
is a good example for this general situation.

It is known that
during drying and annealing, a precursor film
transforms via several intermediate stages (from amorphous to crystalline)
into a bulk perovskite film. Obviously, during these intermediate
stages, the sample can contain amorphous and/or crystalline complexes
of MA, Pb, and I with solvent molecules or water. The transformation
of this phase was found to depend on the sample preparation conditions
and was studied by structure-resolving techniques such as X-ray diffraction.31−39 Although in situ PL spectroscopy has been used to monitor the thermal
annealing of perovskite solar cells,40 the
luminescence spectral properties of the solid pre-perovskite material
have, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated.

In
this contribution, we studied the room-temperature transformation
process of the film prepared by spin-casting of the dimethylformamide
(DMF) precursor solution using optical transmission microscopy, PL
microscopy, and spectroscopy. We observed film crystallization and,
depending on the humidity of the environment, slow transformation
from the transparent crystals to black crystals, which possessed absorption
and PL spectra comparable to those of MAPbI3. The time
evolution of the PL spectra and real-time optical transmission images
were recorded. We found that a partially converted material can possess
PL anywhere between 600 and 760 nm. This blue-shifted emission with
high-energy bands was assigned to small nanoinclusions and clusters
of low-dimensional MAPbI3 (nanosized crystals, two-dimensional
(2D) layers, etc.) in the matrix of a nonconverted precursor phase.
We observed that at a moderate level of humidity (20–60%),
the film almost completely converts to the perovskite phase within
an hour of maturing at room temperature without any annealing. A very
high humidity (above 80%) accelerated the initial conversion; however,
in the end, it led to a transparent phase presumably consisting of
hydrate phases and PbI2. We propose that water plays a
critical role in catalyzing the transformation of the solvate precursor
phases to MAPbI3.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Room-Temperature Crystallization of the Precursor
Film and Its Light Transmission
The time evolution of the
transmission image of the precursor films under different humidity
levels is presented in Figure 1a (see also Video S1 in the Supporting
Information for the sample in dry N2). During the first
minute after spin-casting, the precursor films looked uniform and
transparent. This means that the films were amorphous, containing
a large fraction of the solvent. Then, after a short time of drying,
the precursor films started to crystallize, as illustrated in Video S1. The shape of the transparent crystals
was different, depending on the ambient humidity conditions: from
a leaf-like in dry environment to a needle-like in humid environment
(Figures 1 and S2).

of the precursor
films exposed to nitrogen gas of different humidity levels at room
temperature. The scale bar is 200 μm. Yellow and green lines
show the crystal growth directions of the perovskite (black phase)
and transparent (hydrated perovskite) crystals for the 83% humidity
case. (b) UV–vis absorption of the REF sample, the sample in
dry nitrogen atmosphere after 3 and 60 min of conversion at room temperature.
Inset—transmission micrograph of the REF sample.

Depending on the ambient humidity in the sample
chamber, the further
evolution of the film was different (Figure 1a), as also shown in Video S2 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. In dry N2, the film stayed predominantly
transparent (observed in the wavelength range from 530 to 800 nm)
for more than 1 h. At elevated humidity, the transformation of the
crystals from transparent to black was observed within 1 h. No change
in the geometrical shape of the crystals was noticed during this transformation.

At humidity >80%, the transparent crystals started to locally
change
from being transparent to black already after 10 min of exposure to
the humid atmosphere. We observed the initial formation of several
black regions that were expanding with time and finally occupying
the whole sample area. However, after about 35 min, the black regions
were consumed by the emergence of a transparent phase, and finally
the whole sample became predominantly transparent. A closer look at Video S2 shows that the black crystals started
to convert to transparent crystals of a different shape and different
orientation of the crystal growth in comparison with the black crystals
formed initially. If the initial crystals were growing in a horizontal
fashion (as shown in Figure 1a with the yellow line), the new transparent crystals were
growing mostly in the vertical direction in the center of the image
(as shown in Figure 1a with the green line).

2.2 Analysis of the Absorption
Spectra
As seen from Figure 1a, the sample in dry N2 remained highly
transparent during
the whole observation time, meaning that the full conversion to MAPbI3 did not occur. This becomes obvious by comparing the absorption
spectra measured after 3 and 60 min in dry N2 with the
absorption spectrum of the reference (REF) MAPbI3, as shown
in Figure 1b. Drying
for 3 min led to almost no absorption in the visible range, whereas
after 1 h, some absorption was observed over the whole range of the
typical MAPbI3 absorption, but still much weaker than that
for the thermally annealed REF sample. However, the absorption edge
at about 750 nm clearly shows that a small fraction of the material
was indeed converted to MAPbI3. In addition, we can see
that there is a small absorption feature at 450 nm in the sample matured
in dry N2 for 3 and 60 min, which means that the sample
might also contain some lead-halide-solvent complexes.31

2.3 Time Evolution of PL Spectra
from Precursor(s)
to MAPbI3 at Different Humidity Levels
The PL
spectra of the samples evolved at different humidity levels in N2 (0, 35, 63, and 83%) at room temperature for selected time
durations of exposure to the environment (0, 5, 30 and 60 min) are
presented in Figure 2. For a particular sample, the area excited by the laser was located
at the center of the image, where there were almost no crystals grown
in the sample measured in 50% humidity. That is why the PL spectra
for this sample are not shown. The full dataset can be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Time evolution of the
PL spectra of the precursor films at room
temperature in nitrogen gas of different humidity levels: (a) dry
nitrogen, (b) 35% humidity, (c) 63% humidity, and (d) 83% humidity.
(e) PL spectrum of the REF sample prepared by the standard procedure.
The PL maximum position of the REF sample is marked in all panels
by the vertical green dashed line. The spectra were measured at the
same conditions, and the PL intensity of different samples can be
compared with the accuracy limited to ±30% by the sample inhomogeneity.

PL was absent when the film in
the amorphous state was just transferred
to the controlled humidity setup, as shown in Video S1 in the Supporting Information. Moreover, crystallization
did not immediately lead to a PL signal. It took several minutes until
a detectable PL signal started to appear. From the results presented
in Figure 2, it is
evident that the spectral features emerging during the sample maturing
strongly depend on the level of ambient humidity. The initial PL spectrum
in dry N2 showed a complex multiband shape covering the
region from 600 to 750 nm. Over time, the PL spectrum was continuously
evolving from the multiband appearance to a spectrum with the dominant
band shifting from 715 to 760 nm, whereas the high-energy bands from
600 to 740 nm remain unchanged. The persistence of these bands may
suggest the presence of possibly lead-halide-solvent intermediate
species that remain intact in the absence of ambient water.

During 1 h of measurement, the low-energy bands showed a significant
PL intensity increase (Figure 3c) and red shift with time (Figure 3a). The final maximum wavelength at about
760 nm was still shorter compared with the REF sample (773 nm, Figure 3a). These results
suggest that the precursor film converts at room temperature in dry
N2 to a material containing inclusions of crystal structures,
the spectral features of which are very similar to that of MAPbI3. It is quite remarkable that a strong PL signal was detected
from the sample having a very low absorption at the excitation wavelength
(514 nm). It means that this precursor or intermediate phase must
possess quite a high PL yield.

Figure 3 Evolution of the PL main band maximum
wavelength (a,b) and its
PL intensity (c,d) at different humidity conditions in N2 at room temperature. Panels (a,b) show the evolution in time for
different humidities. Panels (b,c) show the position and intensity
of PL of the final product (after 60 min of maturing) as a function
of humidity. Green horizontal lines labeled with REF show the corresponding
values for the REF sample prepared by the standard procedure. The
accuracy of PL intensity is ±30%.

It appears that the presence of humidity triggers the conversion
of this intermediate phase to MAPbI3. At 35% humidity,
the film transparency after 1 h reduced substantially, and the final
PL band after 1 h ended up at 765 nm, which is very close to the PL
maximum position of the REF sample shown in Figure 3a,b. The high-energy bands related to the
intermediate phase almost disappeared after 1 h of the film maturing.
For example, the band around 600 nm which remained persistent in the
sample measured under dry N2 disappears after 5 min of
measuring under 35% humidity. This indicates that the intermediate
species related to the blue-shifted electronic transition are consumed
in the presence of humidity. The PL intensity of the MAPbI3-related bands increased to the maximum value within the first 15
min after which it remained unchanged.

At the humidity levels
from 35 to 63%, the high-energy bands in
the range from 600 to 740 nm were either negligible or only temporally
present in the PL spectra during 1 h of maturing in the humid environment.
The slight progressive drift of the PL spectra to red indicates that
samples crystallizing at high ambient humidity are probably directly
converted into MAPbI3, as the final PL band maximum was
very close to MAPbI3. Note that in spite of a seemingly
direct conversion to MAPbI3, the PL intensity in this case
was much lower compared with the sample in the intermediate phase
formed at low humidity (compare Figure 3c,d).

When the samples appear black under the
microscope, it means that
the visible light (including the excitation wavelength of 514 nm)
is mostly absorbed by them. For such highly absorbing samples, the
PL intensity is proportional to the PL quantum yield when excited
with the same excitation power. Therefore, when we observed a lower
PL intensity of the perovskite luminescence (for the samples matured
in humid conditions) in comparison with the PL intensity of the intermediate
phase obtained in dry N2, it means that the former possesses
a lower PL quantum yield than the latter (Figure 3d). This can be due to the formation of nonradiative
recombination centers related to the presence of water in the structure.

When humidity was 80% or higher, a rapid formation of the black
phase occurred, with the PL maximum wavelength close to that of the
REF MAPbI3 sample (Figure 3a,b). The PL intensity, however, was much lower than
that of all other samples (Figure 3c,d). The drastic difference compared to the other
samples was that the amount of the black phase (perovskite) reached
its maximum after 20–30 min and then decreased, making a part
of the sample transparent again (Figures 1a, S2, and Video S2 in the Supporting Information). This
affected the PL maximum causing it to shift to blue (Figure 3a,b) and finally led to the
disappearance of PL completely after 1 h (Figure 3a,b). We assign this transformation of the
perovskite crystals to another nonemissive transparent phase that
must be related to the interaction with water, as will be discussed
in detail below.

These results can be summarized as follows:i) In dry
N2 atmosphere, the
precursor film cannot be fully converted to MAPbI3 under
room temperature (approximately 23 °C), and possesses a quasi-stable
intermediate phase with low absorption in the region from 530 to 800
nm, broad PL spectra with several PL bands in the range from 600 to
750 nm, and a relatively appreciable PL quantum yield.

ii) The higher the humidity (if less than
80%), the faster the formation of the perovskite phase without a change
in the visible geometrical shape of the crystals is and the lower
the PL yield of the final material.

iii) Extreme humid conditions (>80%) lead
to a rapid formation of MAPbI3 with low PL intensity, which
then converts to another transparent crystal solid with a different
visual geometry.



2.4 Origin
of the Blue-Shifted PL
It
is natural to test the hypothesis that the formation of bulk MAPbI3 is preceded by the growth of small inclusions of the perovskite
material in the precursor matrix. These inclusions then unite and
form larger crystallites and finally the bulk phase. This process
is called Ostwald ripening and is a common route of aggregation and
crystallization.41 Small inclusions, if
nanosized, indeed exhibit the excitonic confinement effect, leading
to a higher energy of the band gap than the bulk material.42 That is why we propose that the PL in the region
from 600 to 740 nm originates from the small nanoinclusions of low-dimensional
perovskite clusters including 2D structures.14,43

At first glance, this hypothesis may look unsubstantiated;
however, the very fact of observing strong PL of the intermediate
phase gives it a very strong support. This is because, to the best
of our knowledge, low-dimensional perovskite is the only material
consisting of the available components (Pb, I, MA, DMF, and water),
which is documented to show strong PL in the spectral range between
600 and 750 nm. Indeed, it is known that MAPbI3 quantum
dots possess PL emission in the range from 650 to 740 nm43 for the sizes ranging from 6.5 to 7.4 nm, as
shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Smaller crystals should have an even larger blue shift of PL. The
evolution/shift of the PL bands between 650 and 760 nm shown for the
0 and 35% ambient humidity experiments would hence be consistent with
the crystal growth by Ostwald ripening.31

The other possible candidates of the blue-shifted emitters
are
the 2D-layered MAPbI3 nanosheets.44 The 2D MAPbI3 nanosheets having different number of layers
can generate PL covering the range from 514 to 763 nm according to
the literature44 (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The 2D-layered perovskite
nanosheets might be formed during the partial conversion process,
and the different PL wavelengths correspond to different thicknesses
of the layers. With an increasing layer thickness of the 2D structures
or the size of the nanocrystals, the PL position shifts toward red,
becoming more similar to the emission of the bulk perovskite material.
In addition, potentially, some of the blue-shifted PL might come from
the lead-halide-solvent complexes present in an intermediate phase.31,33,34 Although the crystal structures
of several solvate intermediate phases have been identified, nothing
is known about the absorption or luminescence properties of these
intermediates and whether they can possess any substantial luminescence
at all. Identifying the spectra of the crystalline intermediate phases
requires more in-depth and detailed investigations.

2.5 Analysis of the Multiband PL Spectra
To separate several
species contributing to PL, we applied multiband
fitting of the PL spectra, in which each band was fitted with the
pseudo-Voigt model (linear combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian
profiles). As the multiband structure was the most visible in the
sample prepared in dry N2 (Figure 2a), fitting this spectrum was used as a starting
point to identify the positions and widths of the bands. The minimum
number of bands required to fit the whole spectrum with good accuracy
was five, and the approximate positions of the bands were 600, 640,
680, 720, and 740 nm (see Figure 4a). The justification of the necessity of five bands
for fitting is given in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Pseudo-Voigt fitting of PL spectra measured after 5 min (left column)
and 60 min (right column) during the sample evolution under different
humidity levels at room temperature (the data are indicated at the
top of each spectrum): (a,b) dry N2, (c,d) 35% humidity,
and (e,f) 63% humidity.

The PL band at 740 nm (marked band 1) is very close to the
MAPbI3 PL maximum and becomes more and more close to it
in the course
of film conversion. It is known that the band gap energy in the bulk
perovskite is related to the angle of Pb–I–Pb bond in
PbI64– octahedra, which is close to 170°
for pristine MAPbI3 at room temperature.45 If the angle is smaller, the band gap increases.46 Therefore, we assign the experimentally observed
red shift of band 1 with time to the increase of the Pb–I–Pb
angle during the transformation of the material into a more ordered
bulk perovskite structure.

It is important to note that we were
able to apply the five-band
model with the same starting parameters to fit all the PL spectra
obtained in experiments with different humidity levels. During the
fitting, the width of each band was fixed, whereas the position was
allowed to shift by at most 20 nm relative to the positions obtained
for the sample measured in dry N2 (see the Supporting Information for details). The fitted
spectra and the evolution of the number of bands and their positions
are presented in Figures 4, 5 and S6–S9. The main difference between the spectra measured at different ambient
humidity levels was in the relative intensity of the bands. The presence
of clearly defined bands at 600, 640, 680, and 720 nm allows us to
hypothesize that they correspond to specific nanosized, low-dimensional
perovskite structures, which are more readily formed in the intermediate
phase than others. The experimentally observed width variation of
each band is probably related to the distribution of crystal sizes
(2D layer thickness) and great variety of the dielectric properties
of the environment in the highly disordered solid. At the moment,
we are not in a position to tell with confidence what these stable
nanostructures are.

Figure 5 Time evolution of the maxima of the individual PL bands
extracted
from the five-band fitting procedure applied to the experimental data
at different humidity levels (indicated in each plot): (a) dry nitrogen,
(b) 35% humidity, and (c) 63% humidity. The band shift is much smaller
than the distance between the bands.

In general, the higher the humidity of the environment, the
lower
the contribution of the high-energy PL bands to the total PL. At high
humidity, band 5 and band 4 were not observed at all. If band 3 and
band 2 existed from the beginning, they disappeared after several
minutes of exposure to the humid environment, leaving the perovskite
PL (band 1) only (Figure 4e,f).

2.6 Possible Chemical Transformations
of the Precursor
Film
Our results show that MAPbI3 perovskite can
be readily formed at room temperature from the precursor film with
an appropriate amount of water in the environment. If the humidity
is low, an intermediate phase with a weak absorption and broad PL
forms instead of the bulk perovskite structure.

As known from
the literature, during the standard thermal annealing procedure, the
solvent is removed quickly, allowing the MA+ ions and PbI64– octahedra to form the perovskite structure.
In this structure, MA+ is located in the space between
the corner-shared PbI64– ocrahedra,35,37 as shown in the scheme of bulk MAPbI3 in Figure 6. Heating is needed because
of the high boiling point of the commonly used solvents (153 °C
for DMF).

Figure 6 Cartoon illustrating our view on the room-temperature transformation
of the perovskite precursor and final material at different conditions.
It is based on the experimental observation of the film’s transparency,
PL intensity and spectra, visible film crystallinity, literature data
about the intermediate stages, and the origin of the blue-shifted
PL as luminescence of low-dimensional perovskite inclusions proposed
here.

When the precursor film is left
to mature at room temperature in
dry N2, the solvent molecules do not leave the film so
easily. It is not only because of the high boiling point, but also
because the DMF molecules coordinate to lead and form hydrogen bonds
with MA+, which retain the solvent in the film.33 As the size of the MA–DMF complex is
larger than that of MA+, PbI64– cannot be assembled in the corner-sharing perovskite structure.
Instead, the PbI64– octahedral adapt
face-sharing structures (see the schematic of MAPbI3–DMF
in Figure 6), leading
to low absorption in the visible region.33,47,48 The absorption feature at 450 nm from the
sample in dry N2 after 3 and 60 min also indicates that
there might be a complex having similar face-sharing PbI64– octahedral arrangement as that of lead–iodide
compounds.31 Judging from the final absorption
in comparison to that of the REF sample, we conclude that most of
the DMF molecules remained in the structure. However, the emergence
of the perovskite-like absorption and PL means that even in dry atmosphere
in some local regions, DMF could evaporate out leaving MA+ ions to form perovskite unit cells surrounded by the PbI64– ocrahedra.

Our understanding of the whole
process of ripening of the precursor
films and transformation through several intermediate stages is illustrated
in Figure 6. It contains
low-dimensional perovskite structures (giving a strong PL with maxima
at 600, 640, 680, and 720 nm) surrounded by the nonemissive transparent
structure. The disordered bulk perovskite phase, which dominated the
final PL spectra in dry N2, must also be the result of
growing and joining together of low-dimensional perovskite clusters
via the Ostwald ripening process. When such intermediate structures
were further thermally annealed, the DMF molecules evaporated completely,
leading to the formation of perovskite structure in the whole film.

When water was added to the atmosphere, even in small amounts,
intermediate structures with blue-shifted PL were formed after a very
short time, as revealed by the appearance of the multiband PL spectra.
In this case, water probably works as a catalyst helping to remove
the DMF molecules from the structure by either forming hydrogen bonds
with DMF or replacing DMF in the lead-halide-solvent structure because
of the stronger coordination to lead.26,31,32,37 Upon the progress of
crystallization, the high-energy PL bands disappear and low-energy
PL bands red-shift toward 760 nm, as shown in Figures 2, 4, and 5. The clear formation of black nontransparent crystals
shows that the presence of water leads to a high extent of conversion
of the precursor film to MAPbI3. Visually, the optical
density of the resulting samples was similar to that of the REF film
prepared by thermal annealing. Note that the geometrical shape of
the crystals was determined in the very beginning, at the initial
crystallization of the precursor film, into transparent crystals,
and it did not change during further transformation of the material
to MAPbI3 under moderate humidity. This reaffirms the strong
effect of the formation of crystalline intermediates on the morphology
of the MAPbI3 thin films.

Increasing the humidity
led to faster precursor film conversion,
however, with a lower PL yield of the resulting perovskite. We assign
this to a combination of formation of nonradiative recombination channels
because of the interaction with water and a better charge carrier
transport in fully converted films in comparison with the partially
converted ones that allow the excitations to reach the nonradiative
recombination centers.40

When the
humidity was very high (>80%), the perovskite structure
was quickly formed (Figure 1a). However, the reaction obviously did not stop. On the basis
of the literature, we propose that a further interaction of water
with MAPbI3 might make a complex between MA+ and H2O (the hydrogen bond MA–H2O),
as shown in Figure 6.26,31,49−51 As the size of MA–H2O is larger than that of MA+, the perovskite crystal was converted to a hydrated perovskite
crystal, for example, the monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O phase or dihydrate MA4PbI6·2H2O phase, as described in refs,26,51 in which
the PbI64– octahedral reorganized again
from corner-sharing to face-sharing crystal structures. During the
conversion process, some PbI2 might be formed at the same
time.49 On the basis of this understanding,
we assume that the newly formed transparent phase might contain the
hydrated perovskite and PbI2 phases, and it possesses low
absorption in the visible range, thus appearing transparent in the
microscope. Video S2 nicely shows how black
crystals transform to transparent crystals (hydrated phase) with different
crystal growth directions, as also marked in Figure 1a.

3 Conclusions
The room-temperature transformation of the perovskite DMF precursor
film prepared from PbI2 and CH3NH3I was studied by PL micro-spectroscopy and light transmission imaging
as a function of ambient humidity. We found that the amorphous film,
within 1 h, spontaneously converts at room temperature in dry nitrogen
atmosphere to the MAPbI3 intermediate phase. This phase
possesses an appreciable PL with a broad multiband spectrum ranging
from 600 to 760 nm. We propose that the blue-shifted emission comes
from the presence of perovskite nanocrystals and other low-dimensional
perovskite structures of different sizes. It is remarkable that the
PL maxima of several high-energy bands (from 600 to 720 nm) were reproducible
from sample to sample, which may indicate that certain sizes/geometries
of low-dimensional perovskite structures are more stable than others.
We found that adding water to the environment drastically increases
the conversion reaction leading to the formation of a strongly absorbing
perovskite film within 1 h, although having a low PL yield. The shape
of the crystals was found to depend on the humidity of the environment
in which the film was placed for drying. We propose that water works
as a catalyst helping to remove the residual solvent from the film.
However, a prolonged exposure to water at high humidity (>80%)
conditions
leads to the recrystallization of the initially formed perovskite
film to the transparent hydrated perovskite phase.

4 Experimental Section
We used a single-step synthesis method
to prepare the perovskite
samples. The CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3, MA = CH3NH3+) precursor
solutions were prepared by dissolving 461 mg of PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich,
99%) and 159 mg of methylammonium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in 1.25
mL of DMF (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous). The solution was stirred for
2 h at 60 °C. A 100 μL of the precursor solution was dropped
on a microscope coverslip (22 mm × 22 mm × 0.17 mm) at ambient
conditions (≈50% humidity). It was followed by spin-casting
at low speed (650 rpm) to keep the liquid film on the substrate. Within
2 min after spin-casting, the sample was placed in a microscope sample
chamber with controlled atmosphere for observations. The REF sample
was prepared in the same way, but spin-cast at 1460 rpm and annealed
at 80 °C over 1 h in ambient conditions (≈50% humidity
in the air).

The nitrogen (N2) atmosphere, with a
required humidity,
was prepared by bubbling dry N2 gas through water, as shown
in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The humidity was measured using a commercial hygrometer with absolute
accuracy ±10%. The sample was placed in a microscope chamber,
which was constantly flushed with N2 of the desired humidity.
We used a home-built wide-field epifluorescence microscope based on
Olympus IX71 with a 40× objective lens (Olympus LUCPlanFL, NA
= 0.6) (see Figure S1). The Argon-ion laser
(514 nm, CW) was used for the excitation of PL. The excitation spot
of approximately 40 μm in diameter at the sample plane was located
in the center of the image. The power density was approximately 3.6
W/cm2. The PL spectra of the samples as a function of time
were recorded by a charge-coupled device camera (ProEM 512B, Princeton
Instruments) with a slit and a transmission diffraction grating placed
in the optical path. The real-time transmission images and videos
of the crystallization process in the precursor film were recorded
by a Nikon D5100 digital camera using a 530 nm long-pass filter. The
image and PL spectra were recorded every 5 min with <5 s exposure
of the sample to light, whereas for the rest of the time the sample
was kept in dark to avoid photoinduced effects. The absorption spectra
were measured by a UV–vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer: Lambda
1050) using an integrating sphere.
