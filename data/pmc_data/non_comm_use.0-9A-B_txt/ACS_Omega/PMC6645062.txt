Hydrogen
bonding is an important noncovalent interaction that plays
a key role in most of the CHNO-based energetic materials, which has
a great impact on the structural, stability, and vibrational properties.
By analyzing the structural changes, IR spectra, and the Hirshfeld
surfaces, we investigated the high-pressure behavior of 3,6-dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT) to provide detailed description of hydrogen
bonding interactions using dispersion-corrected density functional
theory. The strengthening of hydrogen bonding is observed by the pressure-induced
weakening of covalent N–H bonds, which is consistent with the
red shift of NH/NH2 stretching vibrational modes. The intermolecular
interactions in DHT crystals lead to more compact and stable structures
that can increase the density but diminish the heat of detonation, Q. The calculated detonation properties of DHT (D = 7.62 km/s, P = 25.19 GPa) are slightly
smaller than those of a similar explosive 3,6-bis-nitroguanyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
(D = 7.9 km/s, P = 27.36 GPa). Overall,
the crystallographic and spectroscopic results along with Hirshfeld
surface analysis as a function of pressure reveal the presence of
strong hydrogen bonding networks in the crystal structure of DHT.

1 Introduction
In the world of advanced
technology, researchers are still digging
deep down the track to obtain the balance between high performance
and good molecular stability in order to design high-energy-density
materials. However, the major goal in the field of energetic materials
is to develop more powerful and insensitive explosives, propellants,
pyrotechnics, and oxidizers. To construct these types of explosives,
many factors need to be considered (e.g., safety, energy, cost, etc.)
before they are applied for practical applications.1 One among such parameters is sensitivity, which is a major
problem of energetic materials and has to be taken into account during
production, storage, and transportation. The best approach to improve
the performance of an explosive without compromising safety is to
choose the material that can form hydrogen bonding networks.2 These noncovalent interactions, especially hydrogen
bonding interactions, have a remarkable influence on the physical
and chemical properties of explosives giving rise to efficient packing
in the crystal, which in turn improves the density and stability of
the material.3 In addition, the low solubility
in water is an extra advantage for strongly bonded energetic materials,
which can provide better sensitivity together with low toxicity.4 Various hydrogen-bonded energetic materials have
been extensively studied in the recent years to understand the nature
of intermolecular iterations.5−8 For instance, the strong hydrogen bonding networks
in 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-benzenetriamine (TATB) not only enable higher
density (ρ = 1.937 g/cm3) but also are responsible
for its insolubility in most of the common solvents.9 Recently synthesized ecofriendly energetic material hydrazine
5,5′-bitetrazole-1,1′-diolate (HA·BTO) exhibits
higher crystal density (ρ = 1.913 g/cm3)10 than that of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane
(RDX, ρ = 1.806 g/cm3)11 due to the influence of strong hydrogen bonding networks. The huge
number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds not only play a crucial role
in the formation of an interesting structure but also improve the
stability of HA·BTO. Our previous results also showed that the
presence of strong hydrogen bonding in ammonium dinitramide (ADN)
is responsible for more hygroscopic nature than that of ammonium perchlorate
(AP).12

Pressure on the scale of
gigapascals can cause remarkable changes
in the intermolecular interactions and reveals the hidden phenomena
lying behind the extreme conditions.13−15 Moreover, the effect
of pressure on the crystal structure of energetic materials can facilitate
an efficient crystal packing and tune the noncovalent hydrogen bond
interactions, thereby improving the detonation properties. These types
of studies provide a better understanding about the nature of hydrogen
bonding and structural stability of the energetic materials under
pressure. Li et al. carried out high-pressure studies on energetic
material acetamidinium nitrate16 (C2N2H7+·NO3–) using a diamond anvil cell. Their results show a deviation in the
ideal hydrogen-bonded arrays along with a small slippage between adjacent
ion pairs, which is responsible for the fabrication of new high-energy-density
materials for better detonation performance. The pressure-induced
rearrangement of hydrogen-bonded networks causes a phase transition
in the carbohydrazide (CON4H6) energetic material.17 The reported high-pressure phase with space
group P1 exhibits almost 23.1% higher density than
that of the ambient structure (P21/n). However, the influence of pressure can change the direction of
atoms and molecules in hydrogen-bonded structures, allowing the explosive
properties (such as sensitivity) to be modified. Therefore, it is
particularly interesting to study the high-pressure behavior of hydrogen-bonded
systems for exploring high-energy-density materials.

Nitrogen-rich
energetic materials, especially tetrazine-based compounds,
have attracted special attention due to their high positive heat of
formation (HOF), higher densities, and better oxygen balance (OB).18 As a component of gun and rocket propellant,19 ecofriendly smoke ingredient of pyrotechnic
composition, 3,6-dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT) is
considered to be a nitrogen-rich energetic material with the measured
HOF and H50 values of +536 kJ/mol and
65 cm (2.5 kg, type 12), respectively.19 It can detonate with a rate of 7.54 km/s in the unconfined pressed
pellets of 0.50 in. in diameter. The carbon-free combustion and hot
flames of DHT have made it an ideal for the new-generation ecofriendly
firework.20 Furthermore, it has been used
to design a variety of other nitrogen-rich energetic materials, such
as 3,6-di-azido-1,2,4,5-tetrazine.21 DHT
was first synthesized by Hiskey et al. in 1990s22,23 and later recognized by several experimental groups,24−29 but very few theoretical studies were reported.30−33 Hu et al. studied the intermolecular
interactions of DHT using computational modeling and found that the
strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks dominantly contributed
to the dimers.33 Consequently, the variations
identified on a microscopic level can also affect the macroscopic
properties like density, which may further improve the performance
of an explosive. Therefore, the increase in density of DHT under pressure
may greatly influence the detonation properties and applications.
Herein, we report the high-pressure investigation of structural and
vibrational properties of DHT using first-principles calculations.
Its axial and bond compressibilities and pressure–volume equation
of state have been calculated. In addition, the effect of pressure
on NH/NH2 stretching frequencies is crucial in understanding
the behavior of hydrogen bonding. More information about the variations
in packing patterns were obtained from Hirshfeld surfaces and the
fingerprint plots. The present study explores the pressure-induced
changes in intermolecular interactions to provide valuable information
about the stability of hydrogen-bonded energetic materials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Properties
DHT crystallizes
in the monoclinic P21/c symmetry
with lattice parameters a = 4.043 Å, b = 5.644 Å, c = 12.129 Å, β
= 99.124°, and Z = 2 at 173 K.49 The molecular geometry and crystal structure of DHT are
presented in Figures 1 and 2, where the nitrogen atoms attached
to the hydrazino group and the tetrazine ring are nearly coplanar
with an axial symmetry. Each molecule in the crystal structure connects
with the neighboring molecules to form three-dimensional N–H···N
hydrogen bonding networks in the form of herringbone-like pattern.
The presence of 12 hydrogen bonds in each molecule can strengthen
the stability of the compound. The relaxed lattice parameters and
the optimized volume obtained using various exchange–correlation
functionals are presented in Table 1 along with the experimental values. It is found that
the calculated lattice parameters using local-density approximation
(LDA) are smaller than the experimental results, whereas the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) values are overestimated. The well-known
tendency of LDA/GGA calculations to underestimate/overestimate the
lattice constants is precisely reflected in the obtained volumes (242.5/320.3),
which fall below/above the experimentally measured volume of 272.9,
respectively. In contrast, the correction to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional (TS and D2) provides reasonable improvement with
small deviations when compared with experimental unit cell parameters.
Especially, by the TS method, the error in the calculated volume is
reduced to 0.01%, indicating the necessity of van der Waals (vdW)
interactions while studying the structure of a DHT crystal.

with respect to experiments are given in parentheses; here, “+”
and “–” signs indicate overestimation and underestimation

To understand the origin of
the response of DHT as a function of
pressure, we carried out a detailed investigation of its crystal structure
at different pressures up to 30 GPa in a step size of 5 GPa at 0 K.
Remarkably, DHT exhibits anisotropic behavior along three crystallographic
directions under pressure (see Figure 3a). The compressibility in the a-direction
is markedly greater than that in the b- and c-directions. At 30 GPa, lattice parameters a and b decrease by 28.6 and 8.17%, respectively,
whereas c first increases and then slightly decreases
by 0.17% from its ambient pressure value. This indicates that the
structure of DHT is much softer in the a-axis than
in the b- and c-directions. Furthermore,
as pressure increases, the unit cell volume decreases monotonically
and reaches 85% of its ambient volume by 30 GPa (Figure 3c), which in turn enhances
the density from 1.72 to 2.67 g/cm3. The resulting P–V data is used to calculate the
bulk modulus (B0) and its pressure derivatives
(B0′) by fitting with the third-order Birch Murnaghan equation
of state and are found to be 20.72 GPa and 5.47, respectively. The
obtained results show that DHT is a more harder material than ADN
and AP whose experimental bulk modulus values are reported as 16.450 and 15.2 GPa,51 respectively.

fit to the third-order Birch Murnaghan equation of state.

The applied pressure is not only responsible for
the changes in
the unit cell of DHT but also affects the molecular geometry such
as bond lengths and bond angles. Especially, there exist strong N–H···N
hydrogen bonding networks between neighboring molecules within the
crystal structure. Under ambient conditions, the bond lengths of N4–H4A,
N4–H4B, and N3–H3 are 1.038, 1.038, and 1.048 Å,
respectively. The three N–H bonds of the DHT molecule points
to the three neighboring molecules. These intermolecular hydrogen
bond distances can be measured using the N···H distance.
For instance, DHT molecule connects with neighboring molecules in
the direction of N1, N2, and N4 atoms and the corresponding N···H
distances are 2.157, 2.166, and 1.872 Å, respectively. The average
distances of the intermolecular N···H pairs and N–H
covalent bonds are 2.06 and 1.04 Å, respectively. These hydrogen
bonds exhibit vast changes in the bond strength as a function of pressure.
The calculated pressure dependence of the intramolecular N–H
(dN–H) bond length, intermolecular
N···H (dN···H) and N···N (dN···N) distances, and N–H···N (∠N–H···N)
bond angles are shown in Figure 4. The obtained N–H bond lengths show anisotropic
behavior as a function of pressure (see Figure 4a); especially, the covalent N3–H3
bond length is enlarged and increased from 1.044 Å at 0 GPa to
1.111 Å at 30 GPa. The increase of the dN–H bond length represents the weakening of covalent
N–H bonds by facilitating the release of hydrogen atom. In
general, the N–H covalent bond becomes larger under compression,
whereas the H···N interaction shrinks due to reducing
repulsive force, leading to shortening of the total N–N distance.
From Figure 4b, the
average distances between the intermolecular N···H
contacts at 0 GPa (2.06 Å) and 30 GPa (1.97 Å) are found
to be less than the sum of the vdW radii of H and N (2.7), which supports
the strengthening of hydrogen bond due to shortening of intermolecular
N···H contact distance under pressure. The fundamental
criteria to determine the strengthening or/and weakening of hydrogen
bonding mainly depend on the above analyzed intermolecular distance
and the frequency of the corresponding vibrational stretching modes,
which will be discussed in the next section.

(dN···H) and (c) N···N

2.2 Vibrational Properties
The vibrational
spectroscopy study of hydrogen-bonded energetic materials under compression
can tune the range of frequencies due to weak intermolecular interactions
and explains the effect of hydrogen bonding on the stability of crystal
structure. Usually, the weakening or strengthening of hydrogen bonds
can be visualized based on the shift in the D–H vibrational
frequency. For any material containing D–H···A
hydrogen bonds (D and A represent donor and acceptor, respectively),
the IR spectra corresponding to a particular frequency shift toward
lower energies by decreasing the D–A distance. This can be
explained in terms of electrostatic attraction between the proton
and acceptor atom. When a system is compressed, the distance between
the donor and acceptor atoms reduces, enhancing the electrostatic
attraction between H and A. This leads to lengthening of D–H
bond distance by reducing the D–H stretching frequencies toward
lower energies. This is in accord with the aforementioned N–H
bond length, where the H···N distance decreases as
a function of pressure, which strengthens the hydrogen bonding. As
discussed above, DHT crystallizes in the monoclinic structure containing
32 atoms in the primitive cell, resulting in 96 vibrational modes.
From the group analysis of the P21/c space group, the representation of symmetry decomposition is  Group theoretical analysis of 93 optical modes
shows that 24Ag ⊕ 24Bg are Raman-active
modes and 23Au ⊕ 22Bu are IR-active modes.
The obtained optical modes along with corresponding vibrational assignments
are presented in Table 2. Of these 93 optical modes, 18 were under the frequency of 300 cm–1. However, in remaining 75 modes, 24 pairs of modes
(48 modes) were under 10 cm–1 from each other (15
pairs of the 24 were below 5 cm–1 and 9 of the 24
were below 3 cm–1). The pressure-induced IR spectral
variations of DHT in the frequency range of 70–470, 465–655,
750–1435, 1420–1680, and 1800–3300 cm–1 are presented in Figure 5. The lattice modes between the vibrational frequencies of
58 and 322 cm–1 are mainly due to translational
and/or rotational motion of the tetrazine ring and the NH2 group. As pressure increases, lattice modes shift monotonically
toward higher frequencies due to the reduction of intermolecular separation,
which results in strengthening of interactions between adjacent molecules.52,53Figure 5b shows the
rotation and bending modes of the NH2 group and bending
and breathing modes of the tetrazine ring, whereas NH (wagging, stretching,
rocking, and bending); NH2 (wagging and twisting); ring
breathing; and C–N, C=N, and N–N stretching modes
are shown in the Figure 5c. These modes display a blue shift up to the studied pressure range.
The most pronounced one is the significant splitting of the NH bending
mode (1550 cm–1) into two distinguishable bands
at around 20 GPa (see Figure 5d). One of these modes shows a negative pressure dependence,
whereas the other displays a positive dependence.

The application
of pressure to N–H stretching modes provides
a vital information regarding the variations in hydrogen bonding networks.
As shown in Figure 5e,f, the N–H stretching bands located between 2950 and 3300
cm–1 are composed of three modes: the highest-intensity
mode at 2986 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching
of the NH group. Further, the peaks at 3215 and 3271 cm–1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the
NH2 group (see Figure 6), respectively. In contrast to other bands, the two
lowest-frequency modes located at 2986 and 3215 cm–1 move toward lower frequencies with increasing intensities as a function
of pressure. The highest-frequency mode appears to reduce and eventually
disappears at the maximum pressure of 30 GPa. The frequency lowering
is more pronounced in the NH and NH2 symmetric stretching
groups than in the NH2 asymmetric stretching mode. The
observed decreasing activity in NH/NH2 vibrational modes
agrees with generalized rules of pressure-induced strengthening of
N–H···N hydrogen bonding in the DHT crystal.
As shown in Figure 2, the N–H groups of various molecules serve as proton donors
and nitrogen atoms in the tetrazene ring act as proton acceptors to
form hydrogen bonding networks. The adoption of pressure will reduce
the N–H···N hydrogen bond lengths and the separation
between neighboring molecules along hydrogen-bonded chains. The observed
variation trends of NH/NH2 vibrational modes as a function
of pressure are quantitatively similar to those in the previous studies
of hydrogen-bonded energetic materials.54

2.3 Hirshfeld Analysis
The Hirshfeld
surface analysis has made it possible to explore the nature of intermolecular
interactions that can provide a direct insight into the molecular
crystal. Recently, Ma and his co-workers55 used the Hirshfeld surface theory to study the intermolecular interactions
of 10 existing impact-sensitive highly energetic (SHE) materials including
RDX, 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX), CL-20,
and octanitrocubane. Subsequently, they found that the covalent O···O
interactions are the predominant intermolecular interactions in SHE,
whereas less sensitive highly energetic materials (LSHE) are governed
by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The lack of intermolecular hydrogen
bonding networks and planar big π-conjugated molecular geometric
structures in SHE crystals are responsible for their low molecular
stability when compared to that of LSHE. They also reported that the
intermolecular O···O interactions in SHE can break
more readily and thus are more sensitive compared with LSHE.

To have a clear visualization of the molecule, the Hirshfeld surfaces
were shown in a transparent mode. The strong N–H···N
hydrogen bonding networks between the respective donor and acceptor
atoms are seen as deep red spots on the Hirshfeld surfaces mapped
over dnorm (see Figure 7a) with adjacent molecules connected by N3–H3···N4,
N4–H4A···N1, and N4–H4B···N2
hydrogen bonds. These observations are further confirmed by the electrostatic
potential (see Figure 7b) mapped on Hirshfeld surfaces that clearly demonstrates the presence
of an electropositive (blue) region around hydrogen atoms, whereas
a strong negative electrostatic potential (red) surrounding the nitrogen
atoms. Furthermore, the breakdown of the fingerprint plot into specific
atom types reveals that 58.3% of the total Hirshfeld surfaces are
due to N···H/H···N interactions, which
appear as a pair of distinct sharp spikes in the bottom left/right
region of the two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot, representing
the characteristics of strong hydrogen bonding. The participation
of H···H contacts is shown in the middle region of
the fingerprint plot with overall 26.3% of the Hirshfeld surfaces
(see Figure 8a,b).

surface of the DHT crystal for visualizing the intermolecular
interactions. (b) Electrostatic potential mapped on the Hirshfeld
surface. The green dashed lines represent the hydrogen bonds.

Figure 8 (a, c) Hirshfeld surfaces and (b, d) 2D fingerprint
plots of the
DHT crystal, showing the percentages of close intermolecular contacts
contributing to the total Hirshfeld surface area at 0 and 30 GPa,
respectively. The graphical plots are mapped onto the Hirshfeld surfaces
with dnorm using red (shorter intermolecular
contacts), white (contacts around the vdW separation), and blue (longer
intermolecular contacts) colors.

As pressure increases, the blue region decreases and becomes
almost
invisible at 30 GPa (see Figure 8c,d). However, the red region spreads all over the
Hirshfeld surfaces, indicating an increase in the number of closer
contacts under pressure. In general, the pressure-induced variations
in the intermolecular interactions will tend to bring the molecules
together, enabling a denser molecular packing. However, the structure
of fingerprint has been compressed and drawn toward the origin due
to shortening of longer intermolecular contacts, which is related
to the decrease of de value at elevated
pressures (0 GPa = 1.54 Å; 30 GPa = 1.26 Å). Furthermore,
the orange and red points in the fingerprint plots of 30 GPa indicate
the closest contacts in this crystal structure. Overall, the applied
pressure increases the contribution of N···H/H···N
and N···N interactions whereas decreases the H···H
interactions to the total Hirshfeld surfaces (see Figure 9).

2.4 Detonation
Properties
The performance
of explosives is exclusively determined by their detonation properties:
the higher the detonation velocity and pressure, the greater the detonation
performance. These detonation characteristics can be calculated using
various computer codes through density and HOF. Foremostly, the condensed
phase HOF of CaHbNcOd-based explosives can be predicted by the following equation57 1   2  where ΔfHθ is the condensed phase
HOF (kJ/mol) and ΔfHIECθ and ΔfHDECθ are
the increasing and decreasing energy content parameters of an explosive,
respectively. From eqs 1 and 2, the value of ΔfHθ can be increased by adding more number
of carbon and nitrogen atoms as well as by reducing the number of
hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, the calculated ΔfHθ value for DHT (+501.7 kJ/mol)
is found to be higher than that for BNT (+336.1 kJ/mol) due to the
absence of oxygen atoms in the former. Subsequently, the obtained
crystal density and HOF were used to predict the detonation characteristics
through Kamlet–Jacobs equations58 3   4  where D and P are the detonation velocity (km/s) and detonation pressure (GPa),
respectively, which can be determined by substituting ρ, the
crystal density (g/cm3); M, the average
molecular weight of gaseous products (g/mol); N,
the moles of detonation gas products per gram of explosive; and Q, the heat of detonation (cal/g) values according to the
largest exothermic principle.59 Furthermore,
the sensitivity and performance of an explosive can be roughly predicted
by computing the oxygen balance (OB) using the following formula60 5  where M represents
the molecular
weight and a, b, and c are the number of C, H, and O atoms, respectively. Generally, the
higher OB leads to greater detonation pressure and velocity and thus
superior performance of an explosive.61 At the same time, the negative OB can also be used to predict the
shock sensitivity, where the energetic materials with zero oxygen
balance are highly sensitive to shock.62 The calculated HOF, Q, D, P, and OB of DHT along with BNT are presented in Table 3. Moreover, the detonation
characteristics of DHT (D = 7.62 km/s, P = 25.19 GPa) are smaller than those of BNT (D =
7.9 km/s, P = 27.36 GPa). This inadequacy in the
performance is due to negative OB of DHT that may significantly reduce
the amount of velocity and pressure released during detonation. The
negative oxygen balance also indicates that DHT is less sensitive
than BNT. It is worth noting that the heat of detonation (Q) for DHT is less than that for BNT. The hydrogen-bonded
N–H···N intermolecular interactions serve as
a stabilizing factor that reduces the heat of detonation, Q.63−65Table 3 Calculated Detonation Properties of

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have systematically investigated the structural
and vibrational properties of a hydrogen-bonded energetic material
3,6-dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT) under high-pressure
up to 30 GPa via dispersion-corrected DFT. The obtained ground-state
properties using standard exchange–correlation functionals
(LDA/GGA) show drastic variations from experimental values, whereas
the vdW-TS method provides an accurate description of the intermolecular
interactions for the DHT crystal. The linear compressibility curves
along the crystallographic a- and c-axes are shown to be the most and least compressible, respectively.
The predicted bulk modulus values reveal that DHT is more harder than
the well-known energetic oxidizers ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and
ammonium perchlorate (AP). The existence of strong hydrogen bonding
networks in the high-pressure region weakens the covalent N–H
bond lengths, which is consistent with the decreasing activity of
NH/NH2 stretching vibrational modes. The 2D fingerprint
plots reveal that 58.3% of the total Hirshfeld surfaces are due to
N···H/H···N interactions, indicating
the significance of hydrogen bonds as primary intermolecular interactions
in the DHT crystal. The calculated heat of formation (+501.7 kJ/mol)
and detonation properties (D = 7.62 km/s, P = 25.19 GPa) of DHT are found to be higher and slightly
smaller, respectively, than those of the similar explosive BNT.

4 Computational Details
All calculations were performed
using the plane-wave pseudopotential
method based on DFT, which is implemented through the Cambridge Series
of Total Energy Package.34,35 The exchange–correlation
potentials were described within the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.36 The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
(BFGS) optimization scheme37 was used to
obtain the equilibrium crystal structure. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials
(USP) have been utilized to calculate the structural properties, whereas
norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCP) for obtaining zone-center IR
spectra of DHT under pressure up to 30 GPa. The plane-wave cut-off
energies of 600 eV for USP and 950 eV for NCP were used to expand
the wave functions. A 6 × 5 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack grid38 was used for Brillouin zone integration. The
self-consistent energy convergence criterion was set to 5.0 ×
10–6 eV/atom, and the force per atom diminished
to 0.01 eV/Å. The maximum stress and displacement were set to
0.02 GPa and 5.0 × 10–4 Å, respectively.
The vibrational spectra of DHT were calculated using the linear response
method as implemented in density functional perturbation theory.

The accurate description of weak intermolecular interactions (e.g.,
hydrogen bonding, van der Waals (vdW) forces) has been the subject
of interest from many decades. The conventional exchange–correlation
functionals (e.g., LDA, GGA) in DFT are unable to accurately capture
the long-range vdW forces. For instance, LDA underestimates the volume
by 7–30%, whereas GGA overestimates by 10–15% for CL-20,39 RDX,40 HMX,41 PETN,42 TATB,43 FOX-7,44 and TNAD.45 The inadequacies in describing the intermolecular
interactions not only affect the prediction of accurate crystal geometry
but also lead to errors in the computed properties such as density,
elastic modulus, cohesive energy, and band gap. Recently, various
improvements were made to extend standard DFT to include these types
of weak dispersive forces. Particularly, the empirical vdW corrections
such as the Grimme (DFT-D2)46 and Tkatchenko
and Scheffler (DFT-TS)47 corrections to
PBE are most successful methods. Within the DFT + D framework, the
total energy including vdW correction is given by  where EDFT is
the normal self-consistent Kohn–Sham energy and Edisp is the empirical dispersion correction expressed
as  where Rij, Cij, and s6 represent the interatomic distance, dispersion
coefficient for the pair of ith and jth atoms, and a global scaling factor that only depends on the density
functional used, respectively. The damping function, , is introduced to avoid divergence for
small Rij.

The
Hirshfeld surfaces of DHT were calculated using CrystalExplorer,48 which is a powerful tool for exploring the nature
of intermolecular interactions within the crystal. The strength of
the interactions can be described by dnorm (normalized contact distance)  where di and de denote the internal and external separations
from the nearest atoms and ri and re represent the vdW radii of the two atoms inside
and outside the Hirshfeld surfaces. These close intermolecular contacts
were identified by a three-dimensional dnorm surface in which the positive/negative values represent the intermolecular
contacts that are longer/shorter than the vdW separations. The graphical
plots are mapped onto the Hirshfeld surfaces with dnorm using red (shorter intermolecular contacts), white
(contacts around the vdW separation), and blue (longer intermolecular
contacts) colors. In addition, the 2D fingerprint plots associated
with Hirshfeld surfaces can provide a summary of intermolecular interactions
in the molecule.
