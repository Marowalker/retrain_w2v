α-Pinene-modified
triethoxysilane (α-PTES) was synthesized
by hydrosilylation in the presence of Karstedt’s catalyst.
The structure of α-PTES was determined by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Under the catalysis
of an organotin catalyst, α-PTES, which was the cross-linking
agent, and the hydroxy-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) matrix were
utilized to prepare the room-temperature vulcanized silicone rubber.
Morphology, thermal performance, and mechanical properties of the
modified silicone rubber were investigated by scanning electron microscopy,
thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and a universal
testing machine. Because of the strong rigidity of the ring structure
of α-pinene, the thermal and mechanical properties of modified
silicone rubber were improved greatly than those of the silicone rubber,
and the cross-linking agent of which was methyltriethoxysilane. Results
showed that the tensile strength and the break at elongation increased
by 69.2 and 125%, respectively, and they are nearly doubled compared
to the unmodified silicone rubber.

==== Body
Introduction
The structure of the polysiloxane contains
inorganic and organic
groups, which make polysiloxane have the function of inorganic and
organic materials.1 Room-temperature vulcanized
(RTV) silicone rubber is a polymer elastic material, which is synthesized
from polysiloxane, and shows heat resistance, weather resistance,
biocompatibility, ozone resistance, electrical insulation, chemical
stability, and so on.2−5 In addition, RTV silicone rubber is widely applied in the electrical,
petroleum, chemical, construction, munition, aerospace, and space
exploration fields due to its unique properties.6,7 However,
the poor mechanical properties cause a weak intermolecular force of
the RTV silicone rubber, limiting the practical application.8 Thus, it is highly desirable to improve the mechanical
properties of the RTV silicone rubber.9

Chemical modification, such as modification of the cross-linking
agent and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix, and filler incorporation
could significantly improve the mechanical properties and thermostability
of the silicone rubber.10−14 The utilized fillers that made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and iron
oxide (Fe2O3) were made by Li et al., and the
thermostability of the silicone rubber was improved.15 By using polymethyl(ketoxime)siloxane (PMKS) as a new cross-linking
agent, Zhan et al. improved not only thermal but also mechanical properties
of room-temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubbers.16 Studies on the thermal degradation properties
of poly(dimethyldiphenyl)siloxane copolymers, PDMS, and poly(dimethyldiphenylsiloxane)
were conducted by Deshpande and Rezac, and the results showed the
reduction of activation energy when phenyl groups were introduced.17,18

In recent years, with the global resource crisis and awareness
of environmental protection, renewable biomass resources are good
alternatives for petroleum-based compounds.19−21 The rigid structures,
such as lignin, cyclodextrin, and rosin, of biomass resources have
great potential to prepare polymers with high mechanical and thermal
properties.22,23 Choi et al. studied the RTV silicone
rubber and significantly improved its mechanical properties and thermal
performance by using the rosin-grafted poly(dimethylsiloxane) (RGSO).24 The effects of acrylpimaric acid-modified aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APA-APTES), which was the cross-linking agent, on the thermostability
and mechanical properties of modified silicone rubber were studied
by Yang et al.25 The maleated rosin-modified
fluorosilicone rubbers (MR-FSR) were synthesized by Xu et al., and
the imide-containing vinyl fluorosilicone resin (MR-VFS) was the novel
cross-linking agent. The results showed that the high-temperature
thermostability and tearing strength of fluorosilicone rubber could
be greatly increased by MR-VFS.26 Li et
al. found that the rosin-modified aminopropyltriethoxysilane (RA)
was the cross-linking agent, and the hydroxy-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) was the matrix; RTV silicone rubber could be modified under
the catalysis of an organotin, which exhibited a significant enhancement
in the mechanical properties and thermostability significantly.7 Because of the rosin’s polar hydrogenated
phenanthrene ring structure and good rigidity, improvements in the
mechanical properties and thermal performance of silicone rubber could
be successfully achieved according to the research mentioned above.

The two main components secreted by pines are rosin and turpentine.27,28 Turpentine is mainly composed of terpene compounds such as α-pinene
and β-pinene and has strong chemical reactivity for oxidation,
isomerization, rearrangement, addition, polymerization, and other
chemical reactions.29 In addition, turpentine
has similar rigidity and chemical stability to petroleum-based cycloaliphatic
compounds.30,31 These properties make turpentine
have great potential in the preparation of polymers with high thermal
stability and mechanical properties. Xu et al. prepared the bio-based
alkyd resin by utilizing raw materials including tung oil and turpentine-based
acrylate (IBOA). The results showed that when the content of IBOA
was increased, the water resistance, thermostability, pencil hardness,
and mechanical properties of the alkyd resins became much better.32 Wu et al. prepared a two-component aqueous terpene
epoxy resin (EP)/polyurethane (PU) composite polymer by cross-linking
of terpene-based epoxy resin polyol dispersion prepared from turpentine
with polyisocyanate, and the composite product has good gloss, impact
strength, adhesion, flexibility, stain resistance, heat resistance,
and blocking resistance.33,34 Meanwhile, there was
little research on the modification of silicone rubber by turpentine.

In this work, α-pinanyltriethoxysilane (α-PTES) was
prepared by the hydrosilylation of α-pinene and methyltriethoxysilane
in the presence of Karstedt’s catalyst. To prepare the RTV
silicone rubber (Figure 1), hydroxy-terminated poly(dimethyisiloxane) (PDMS) and α-PTES,
which was a new cross-linking agent, were further used. The effects
of α-PTES on morphologies and mechanical and thermal properties
of modified silicone rubber were investigated in this paper.

(SRαPT) and pinanyl triethoxysilane (α-PTES).

Results and Discussion
Properties of α-PTES
FT-IR
Analysis
The chemical structures of α-pinene,
triethoxysilane, and α-PTES were determined through FT-IR spectra.
The spectrum in Figure 2a shows that the absorption peak is at 3024 cm–1 (stretching vibrations due to unsaturated C–H), 885 cm–1 (bending vibration due to unsaturated C–H),
and 1658 cm–1 (stretching vibration of C=C).
As shown in Figure 2, after hydrosilylation with triethoxysilane, at 1658 cm–1, the C=C stretching vibration of α-pinene disappeared
in spectra of Figure 2a,c. The absorption peaks were at 2198 and 852 cm–1 (Si–H stretching) as shown in Figure 2b, which also shows that characteristic peaks
of Si–H at 2198 and 852 cm–1 are almost completely
disappeared, indicating the successful synthesis of α-PTES (spectra
in Figure 2b,c).

and (c) α-pinanyl triethoxysilane (α-PTES). (d) Mass spectra
of α-pinanyl triethoxysilane (α-PTES).

MS Analysis
As the chemical formula
of α-pinanyl
triethoxysilane (α-PTES) is C16H32O3Si, the exact mass is 300.2121. As shown in Figure 2d, 285.1175 is the value of
mass of α-PTES losing one methyl group, 271.1019 is the value
of mass of α-PTES losing one ethyl group, and 257.0863 is the
value of mass of α-PTES losing one methyl group and one ethyl
group. MS m/z (CI): (M + Na)+ calcd for C16H32O3SiNa 323.2013;
found, 323.1120, and this confirms that the target product has been
formed.

NMR Analysis
Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectra in CDCl3, which further confirmed the structure of α-PTES. The protons
of the C=C in α-pinene are related to the fascicles of
signal peaks at 4.24 ppm. In addition, at 4.24 ppm, the clusters of
signal peaks were resulted from the chemical shifts in Si–H
protons. According to curves in Figure 3a,c, the protons of the Si–C for the product
are associated with the fascicles of signal peaks at 1.46 and 1.1
ppm, confirming that the target product has been formed. Also, the
peak at 7.26 ppm is CDCl3.

Characterization of SRαPT and SRTE
Under the
condensation reaction of cross-linking agents and poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS), SRαPT and SRTE were synthesized at room temperature
using organotin as a catalyst. The components and conditions, such
as the cross-linking agent, curing catalyst, environmental conditions,
PDMS, and temperature, could affect the cross-linking process. Dibutyltin
dilaurate catalyst (180 μL) and PDMS (5000 mPa·s, 30 g)
in this experiment were utilized to all the samples. We used the α-PTES
instead of MTES as the cross-linking agent to study the effects of α-PTES
on the thermal performance and mechanical properties of modified RTV
silicone rubber.

Morphologies
As shown in Figure 4a (SRTE-4), the RTV
silicone rubber is colorless
and transparent when the cross-linker is MTES. However, when the cross-linking
agent is α-PTES instead of MTES, the modified RTV silicone rubber
has low transparency (Figure 4a, SRαPT-2). There may be a change in the microstructure.
As shown in Figure 4b–f, the morphologies of modified RTV silicone rubbers are
characterized by using scanning electron microscopy. Rigid ring structures
of α-PTES would increase the molecular chain rigidity of the
polymer matrix. Therefore, as the α-PTES increases, the modified
RTV silicone rubber becomes rougher than the unmodified silicone rubber.36 In addition, the microphase in RTV silicone
rubber would be separated because of the aggregation of the rigid
ring groups in α-pinene.13,37

Thermal Properties
By conducting the TGA, we investigated
the influence of different cross-linker contents on the thermal properties
of modified silicone rubber. There is obvious three-stage weightlessness
in the RTV silicone rubber samples. The first stage is mainly the
decomposition of RTV silicone rubber side chain groups from 300 to
500 °C, for example, methyl collapses to methylene radicals.
The second stage is the RTV silicone rubber’s main chain fracture
process that generates low molecular rings primarily from 500 to 600 °C.
The third stage is a carbonization process from 600 to 800 °C
(Figure 5).

of SRTE. (b) DTG curves of SRTE. (c) TG curves of
SRαPT. (d) DTG curves of SRαPT.

We have tested the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) of
the
RSTE-4 residue after the TGA in Figure 6a. From the diagram in Figure 6a, we can see that the elements of the RSTE-4
residue are mainly Si and O, and this is because of the restrained
silicone rubber macromolecules with the increase of MTES cross-linking.

Figure 6 (a) EDS
of SRTE-4 residue. (b) Cross-linking densities of SRTE
and SRαPT.

Cross-Linking Density
The cross-linking density of
RTV silicone rubber has an influence on its mechanical properties.
The cross-linking density was measured by an equilibrium swelling
method. As shown in Figure 6b, the α-PTES-modified silicone rubber (SRαPT)
shows an increasing cross-linking density when the content of the
cross-linking agent α-PTES was increased from 7 to 11 wt % and
has a slightly decrease as α-PTES increased to 13%. However,
the change in the cross-linking density of silicone rubber (SRTE)
is not obvious. Such an increase can be caused by chain entanglement
and intermolecular forces, which increase with an increasing content
of α-PTES.

Mechanical Properties
As shown in Figure 7a,b, the α-PTES-modified
RTV silicone rubber showed significantly higher mechanical properties
than the unmodified silicone rubber. Figure 7c,d shows that the break at elongation and
tensile strength of the α-PTES-modified silicone rubber were
significantly improved. The tensile strength of SRαPT-3 was
0.66 MPa, and the break at elongation was 285.8%. They are nearly
doubled compared to the SRTE-2 sample. When the elongation is 100%,
the tensile moduli of all SRαPT are higher than those of all
SRTE in Figure 7e.
This is because the rigid ring structure of the α-PTES increased
the rigid segment of the polysiloxane and improved the interaction
between the molecules. Thus, it is highly desirable to improve the
mechanical properties of the RTV silicone rubber.38−40

(d) Break at elongation of SRαPT and SRTE. (e) Tensile moduli
of SRαPT and SRTE at 100% elongation. (f) Hardness of RTV silicone
rubber.

Moreover, as the α-PTES
content increases from 0 to 13 wt
%, the mechanical properties, tensile modulus, and the break at elongation
of the RTV silicone rubber increase then decrease and reach the maximum
when the α-PTES content is 11%. Although the microphase separation
would occur, a lower α-PTES cross-linking agent, which could
be homogeneously dispersed in the matrix, could be utilized to cure
the silicone. As the α-PTES increased, the mechanical properties
of the RTV silicone rubber were improved. Figure 7c–e shows that the break at elongation,
mechanical properties, and tensile modulus of RTV silicone rubber
begin decreasing when the α-PTES content exceeding 11 wt %.
The decrease may result from the excess α-PTES, which could
cause agglomeration, self-cross-linking, and microphase separation.13,41 This indicated that the mechanical properties of the silicone rubber
could be positively affected by the uniform distribution of the cross-linking
agent (α-PTES). The hardness of modified silicone rubber (SRαPT-4,
30 A) is better than that of silicone rubber (SRTE-4, 21 A) (Figure 7f). In addition,
with increasing cross-linking agent (α-PTES), the hardness of
SRαPT increased from 24 to 30 A.

Dynamic Mechanical Properties
The curves of storage
moduli (E′) of SRαPT and SRTE are shown
in Figure 8a,b. The E′ is closely related to the chemical structure and
cross-linking density of RTV silicone rubber. Compared to SRER-1 (4219
MPa), the E′ values of SRαPT-4 (4446
MPa) increased to 227 MPa. The silicone chain fluidity of the RTV
silicone rubber would have significant restrictions because the increased
modulus would enhance the chain entanglement and molecular chain rigidity.
As the excess α-PTES would cause the self-cross-linking and
agglomeration, the E′ values of SRαPT-4
decreased slightly compared to those of SRαPT-3, resulting in
decreasing cross-linking density.13,38,42

and
tan δ of SRTE. (b) Curves of storage modulus (E′) and tan δ of SRαPT. (c) Tg curves of SRαPT and SRTE.

As shown from Figure 8a,b, there is one Tg for each
sample,
which is between −135 and −75 °C. The Tg of α-PTES-modified silicone rubber increased from
−116.3 (SRαPT-1) to −115.0 °C (SRαPT-4),
and the increase was greater than that of the unmodified silicone
rubber (SRTE-4). This is because the polysiloxane chain mobility is
limited due to the rigid ring structure of α-PTES and the corresponding
less flexible polysiloxane chain.23,43,44Figure 8c shows that the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of each modified silicone rubber is confirmed by the
peak of the tan δ curve.

Conclusions
Under
the catalysis of the Karstedt’s catalyst, we synthesized
a new cross-linking agent for the preparation of RTV silicone rubber,
α-PTES, through the hydrosilylation of α-pinene with triethoxysilane. 1H NMR and FT-IR confirmed the chemical structure of the cross-linking
agent. The rigid ring structure and polyfunctionality of α-pinene
would result in increasing cross-linking density of the modified RTV
silicone rubber. Thus, the mechanical and thermal properties of the
α-PTES-modified RTV silicone rubber showed significantly better
than those of the unmodified silicone rubber, and the modified silicone
rubber (SRαPT-3) has a tensile strength of 0.66 MPa and a break
at elongation of 285.8%, which increase by 69.2 and 125%, respectively,
and they are nearly doubled compared to the unmodified silicone rubber
(SRTE-2). In addition, the E′ values of SRαPT-4
(4446 MPa) increased by 227 MPa compared with those of SRER-1 (4219
MPa). The increased chain entanglement and molecular chain rigidity
would enhance the modulus, and the silicone chain fluidity of the
silicone rubber would also have significant restrictions. This study
shows that by using α-pinene as a new cross-linking agent, the
improvement of the mechanical and thermal properties of the silicone
rubber could be achieved.

Materials and Methods
Materials
α-Pinene
(ω = 98%), dibutyltin
dilaurate (ω = 95%), and methyltriethoxysilane (MTES, ω
= 98%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Technology Co., Ltd. Triethoxysilane
(ω ≥ 99%) was purchased from Shandong Silicon Branch
New Material Co., Ltd. Karstedt’s catalyst (Pt of ∼2%,
in xylene) was purchased from Shanghai Neutron Star Chemical Technology
Co., Ltd. Hydroxy-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, 5000 mPa·s)
was purchased from Hubei New Universal Chemical Co., Ltd. The chemicals
were not further purified in this study.

Synthesis of α-Pinanyl-Modified
Triethoxysilane (α-PTES)
The reflux condenser, constant
pressure dropping funnel, and thermometer
were assembled on a 50 mL three-necked flask that was correspondingly
filled with α-pinene (5 g), Karstedt’s catalyst (in xylene,
Pt of ∼2 wt %, 82 μL), and triethoxysilane (9 g). The
mixture was heated to 100 °C under continuous stirring for 60
h at a speed of 250 r/min. Finally, the liquid product and the unreacted
raw material were distilled off under reduced pressure and normal
pressure, respectively.

Preparation of Modified RTV Silicone Rubber
While using
a nitrogen atmosphere as a protection, we added both the cross-linking
agents (α-PTES or MTES, 2.1 g) and the PDMS (30 g) to the three-necked
flask. The blend was then continuously stirred at a speed of 1500
r/min for 15 min at room temperature. Next, we added 180 μL
of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst to the same flask and stirred the
mixture continuously for 15 min at a speed of 1500 r/min. Finally,
we removed the bubbles and rapidly poured the mixture into a Teflon
mold. To make the surface of the obtained modified silicone rubber
sheet smooth, we cured the mixture for 7 days at room temperature.
The ingredients of each sample are shown in Table 1 in detail.

In all ingredient compositions, dibutyltin
dilaurate (180 μL)
and PDMS (30 g) were respectively functioned as the catalyst and the
matrix. As shown in Table 1, the mass fractions of α-PTES and MTES both increase
from 7 to 13 wt %.

Measurements and Characterization
FT-IR
Through attenuated total reflectance (ATR), Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were performed on a Thermo Scientific
Nicolet IS10 spectrometer (Nicolet). Each sample was analyzed through
16 scans between 500 and 3500 cm–1 at a 4 cm–1 resolution.

NMR
At two frequencies, 400.13 and
100.61 MHz, an AV400
spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) recorded the 1H NMR spectra
for α-PTES. We used tetramethylsilane (TMS) and deuterochloroform
(CDCl3) as the internal standard and solvent for α-PTES,
respectively. The signals of TMS and CDCl3 were the chemical
shift values.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectra were
determined by a
Reflex III (Bruker, Billerica, MA) time-of-flight mass spectrometer
equipped with a reflectron and a 1.25 m flight tube. The sample was
analyzed with the accelerating voltage (19 kV) and reflectron voltage
(20 kV), and the delay times were 200 ns. All the experiments were
carried out in a reflectron mode.

Density
Through
a pycnometer, the samples’ densities
were measured.

TG
A TG209F1 (Netzsch, Germany)
was used to analyze
the thermal stability of the sample. The samples were heated from
25 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an Al2O3 crucible under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Hardness
The hardness of silicone rubber was determined
by an LX-A durometer (Eide fort, China) at room temperature and ∼65%
relative humidity.

Mechanical Properties
To analyze
the mechanical properties
of samples, a UTM6502 universal testing machine (Suns) with a capacity
of 500 N was used. The analysis was conducted after preparing five
dumbbell-shaped specimens by using a crosshead with an RH around 50%
at 23 °C and a speed of 500 mm/min. The data was expressed as
the average of five measurements.

SEM
At a voltage
of 10 kV, the morphologies of all
samples were observed through a scanning electron microscope (QUANTA
200, FEI, Holland). After coating the fractured surface of the samples
with gold, an analysis was conducted.

EDS
The element
composition of silicone rubber was
determined by X-ACT energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Oxford,
England).

DMA
A DMA Q800 (TA) was used to
analysis the dynamic
mechanical property of the sample. Under the stretching mode, at a
heating rate of 3 °C/min and with a 1 Hz frequency, the samples
were analyzed with a scanning temperature range from −135 to
−75 °C.

Cross-Linking Density
An equilibrium
swelling method
was used to recalculate the cross-linking densities of SRαPT
and SRTE. Before analysis, at a temperature of 25 °C, SRαPT
or SRTE (around 0.2 g) was immersed into toluene (25 mL) that was
in a sealed container for 48 h. After taking the samples out of toluene
and weighing them after removing the excess toluene by a filter paper,
the samples were immersed into toluene for another time. We repeated
the above steps every 3 h until reaching the swelling balance. According
to eqs 1 and 2, the cross-linking density was obtained.8,35 1   2  

In
the above formula, φ is the
volume fraction, m0 is the original sample
weight, ρ is the modified silicone rubber density, ms is the swelling weight of the modified silicone rubber,
ρ1 (0.87 g/cm3) is the toluene density,
and ν0 (106.54 cm3/mol) is the toluene
molar volume. χ1 (0.465) is the interaction parameter
of the solvent and polymer, MC is the
mean molecular weight of the cross-linking points, and γe represents the cross-linking density.
