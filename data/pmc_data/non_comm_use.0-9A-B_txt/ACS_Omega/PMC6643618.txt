Menaquinones
(MKs) contain both a redox active quinone moiety and
a hydrophobic repeating isoprenyl side chain of varying lengths and
degrees of saturation. This characteristic structure allows MKs to
play a key role in the respiratory electron transport system of some
prokaryotes by shuttling electrons and protons between membrane-bound
protein complexes, which act as electron acceptors and donors. Hydrophobic
MK molecules with partially and fully saturated isoprenyl side chains
are found in a wide range of eubacteria and archaea, and the structural
variations of the MK analogues are evolutionarily conserved but poorly
understood. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, uses predominantly MK-9(II-H2) (saturated at the second isoprene unit) as its electron
carrier and depends on the synthesis of MK-9(II-H2) for
survival in host macrophages. Thus, MKs with partially saturated isoprenyl
side chains may represent a novel virulence factor. Naturally occurring
longer MKs are very hydrophobic, whereas MK analogues that have a
truncated (i.e., one to three isoprenes) isoprenyl side chain are
less hydrophobic. This improves their solubility in aqueous solutions,
allowing rigorous study of their structure and biological activity.
We present the synthesis and characterization of two partially saturated
MK analogues, MK-2(II-H2) and MK-3(II-H2), and
two novel fully saturated MK derivatives, MK-2(I,II-H4)
and MK-3(I,II,III-H6).

Introduction
Menaquinones (or naphthoquinones,
MKs) belong to the class of lipoquinones,
which are a type of lipid-quinone containing isoprenoids that have
a variety of biological roles. These molecules contain both a redox
active quinone moiety and a hydrophobic repeating isoprenyl side chain
of varying lengths and degrees of saturation (Figure 1) depending on the organism. Although the
naturally occurring lipoquinones generally have longer isoprenyl side
chains, these MK analogues have very low water solubility, which causes
problems for biological assays; therefore, the use of truncated MK
derivatives can circumvent solubility issues in aqueous assays. The
1943 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to Henrik Dam
and Edward Doisy for the discovery and characterization of vitamin
K (a MK), a key cofactor in blood coagulation.1 The interest in and the importance of MK/vitamin K, its derivatives,
and vitamers (e.g., vitamins K1, K2, and K3) have remained strong. Vitamin K1, also known
as phylloquinone, is found in green plants and contains four isoprene
units with the terminal three saturated and functions as an electron
acceptor during photosynthesis within photosystem I.2 Vitamin K2, also known as menaquinone-4 (MK-4),
has been the subject of interesting reports, demonstrating its biological
roles and applications over the last 10 years.3−6 Vitamin K3 (or menadione),
the simplest 1,4-naphthoquinone derivative, which lacks the isoprenyl
side chain and non-naturally occurring N-alkylated MK derivatives
has also shown interesting biological properties.7−11 In 2017, the potent cyclic peptide antibiotic, Lotilibcin,
was demonstrated to be effective against Gram-positive bacteria including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.12 The activity of Lotilibcin was attributed
to lysis of the bacterial membrane, where its membrane-disrupting
effects depended on the presence of MK, which leaves the question
if other MK derivatives have the same effect.12 This report underlines the importance of understanding the relationship
between the MK structure, its biological role, and its biological
function.

as MK-9(II-H2)] present within M. tuberculosis, (B) partially saturated menaquinone-2(II-H2) [abbreviated

saturated menaquinone-3(II-H2) [abbreviated as MK-3(II-H2)], and (E) fully saturated menaquinone-3(I,II,III-H6) [abbreviated as MK-3(I,II,III-H6)].

MK analogues that contain partially and fully saturated isoprenyl
side chains of various lengths are found in eubacteria and archaea.
These characteristics are evolutionarily conserved and have long been
used in taxonomic classification efforts and phenotypic organization
of bacteria.13−15 MK analogues with one or more saturated isoprene
units are found in some members of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria, and the systematic preparation and characterization of a
few selected truncated partially and fully saturated MK derivatives
are described in this manuscript.14−17 In contrast to partial saturation,
the fully saturated MK-7(14H) has been observed in archaea, which
are single-celled microbes comprising part of the human microbiota.18,19 It is thought that the full saturation of the isoprenyl side chain
observed in archaea makes the cellular membrane more tolerant to extreme
environments (e.g., high temperature, high salinity, and low/high
pH).18 Thus, many MK homologues that contain
various degrees of saturation in their isoprenyl side chains have
been isolated, but there is a limited understanding of the function
of partially saturated derivatives.16,20 Menaquinone-9(II-H2) [abbreviated as MK-9(II-H2), Figure 1A], which is saturated at the
second isoprene, has been observed in a number of bacteria including Mycobacterium phlei and pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis.14,16,17,21,22 The biological significance of the partial saturation
of MK-9 has remained unclear even 50 years after its first description.20 Remarkably, the synthesis of MK-9(II-H2) was recently shown to be essential for M. tuberculosis survival in host macrophages (white blood cells of the immune system);
thus, MK-9(II-H2) represents a potential novel virulence
factor involved in tuberculosis (TB) disease progression.23

Part of our ongoing studies includes why
partial saturation of
MK-9 increases the virulence of pathogens such as M.
tuberculosis.23 Therefore,
we need access to MK analogues containing partially and fully saturated
isoprenyl side chains. However, in general, they are neither commercially
available nor sold as a pure geometric isomer as in the case of vitamin
K1. The potential for the formation of cis and trans MK
isomers and the separation and characterization of these geometric
isomers are sometimes overlooked in the literature, but it is critical
for their applications in biological systems. The use of cis/trans
MK mixtures in biological systems would lead to inaccurate biological
activities. Recently, the separation and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) analysis of cis/trans mixtures of the dietary supplement menaquinone-7
(MK-7) was reported, demonstrating the importance in understanding
the different chemical, biochemical, conformational, and physical
properties exhibited between cis and trans MK isomers.24,25 Truncated MK analogues (i.e., one to three isoprene units) have
the advantage of being less hydrophobic, which can improve their biological
activity compared to longer isoprenyl MK analogues (e.g., MK-7 and
MK-9) and can be prepared using a similar methodology described in
this manuscript and reports elsewhere.26,27

In this
manuscript, we have synthesized and characterized four
partially and fully saturated truncated isoprenyl MK derivatives (Figure 1B–E) as well
as separated and characterized the geometric isomers formed in the
reactions. We have adopted the simple naming system where MK-2 with
a saturated double bond at the second isoprene unit is denoted as
menaquinone-2(II-H2) and abbreviated as MK-2(II-H2), where II denotes the second isoprene unit and H2 denotes
the saturation of one double bond (Figure 1B).23,28 This naming system
follows for higher degrees of saturation such as MK-2(I,II-H4), that is, saturated at isoprenes I and II and MK-3(I,II,III-H6), that is, saturated at isoprenes I, II, and III (Figure 1C,E). Although MK-2(II-H2) and menaquinone-3(II-H2) [abbreviated as MK-3(II-H2)] were known in literature reports mostly in the 1950s29−34 and MK-2(II-H2) was considered in a computational model
study,35 there are no modern syntheses
reported, and these analogues have not been extensively characterized
nor have their geometric isomers been resolved and characterized in
the literature. Evidence supports the trans MK isomer as the only
biologically active isomer.27 Therefore,
the separation and isolation of geometric isomers of MK derivatives
is critical when testing these compounds in biological assays.

The synthesis and characterization of partially and fully saturated
isoprenyl MK analogues, such as the two novel fully saturated MK derivatives
described in this work, are important for understanding their requirement
in biological systems, as little is known about their physical properties,
reactivity, or 3D-conformation within solution or cell membranes.
Access to these partially and fully saturated truncated MK analogues
in the pure geometric form is critical, considering the recent discovery
and timeliness for understanding why partially saturated MKs [e.g.,
MK-9(II-H2), Figure 1A] may be a potential virulence factor against pathogenic M. tuberculosis, when currently around one-third
of the world’s population is infected with latent TB and over
1.3 million people worldwide die annually from TB.36

Results and Discussion
In the following, we describe
the synthesis and characterization
of two partially saturated MK analogues, MK-2(II-H2) and
MK-3(II-H2), using modified and adapted procedures. We
also describe the synthesis and characterization of two novel fully
saturated MK analogues, MK-2(I,II-H4) and MK-3(I,II,III-H6), utilizing a key radical alkylation reaction. This is the
first report on a preparatory scale utilizing a primary alkyl radical
coupling reaction to access fully saturated MK derivatives, although
in situ analysis of menaquinone-1(H2) was reported previously.37 Importantly, a convenient analysis can be carried
out by rapid detection using benzene-d6 as an NMR solvent for the evaluation of cis and trans MK mixtures
(peaks coalesce in CDCl3 disguising potential isomers formed).
The cis/trans isomers can then be readily separated using preparative
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and analyzed.

Synthesis and Characterization
of MK-2(II-H2)
The partially saturated MK analogue,
MK-2(II-H2) 3, was synthesized in a single
step using Friedel–Crafts
coupling between menadiol 1 and isophytol 2 (Scheme 1). The precursor
menadiol was synthesized, as previously described, from menadione.26,38 The partly hydroxylated heterogeneous Lewis–Brønsted
acid catalyst, MgF2-48, was synthesized as previously described.39−41 We chose MgF2-48 over other catalysts because it was
readily prepared from inexpensive methanol and Mg0 powder
as well as from commonly available 48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid.39−41 Furthermore, the partly hydroxylated MgF2 catalyst was
recently used with a biphasic n-heptane/polyene carbonate
solvent system to synthesize vitamin K1 and K1-chromanol.40 Therefore, we thought this
catalyst would be an excellent choice to synthesize the partially
saturated MK-2(II-H2), which has the analogous (but truncated)
structure of vitamin K1 [or MK-4(II,III,IV-H6)].

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme for the Coupling Reaction Using a MgF2-48 Catalyst To Obtain MK-2(II-H2) 3 from
Menadiol 1 and Isophytol 2(40)
The Friedel–Crafts
alkylation of 1 and 2 (Scheme 1) followed by in situ oxidation
of dihydro-MK-2(II-H2)
formed the desired product 3 in an 11% yield. The low
yield may be attributed to the formation of the undesired C2 isomeric
side product (see Scheme 1), which was readily separated using column chromatography.
The inherent instability of menadiol, which is prone to auto-oxidation
even when purified immediately before use may also contribute to the
low yield. MK-2(II-H2) 3 was obtained as a
yellow/red oil. The reaction was carried out in the dark, and the
product was exposed minimally to light as previous studies have shown
that interconversion to undesirable geometric isomers can occur through
photo-oxidation if exposed to light.16,42,43

We considered other possible catalysts to carry
out the transformation
shown in Scheme 1.
For instance, we also explored a commercially available strong Brønsted
acid catalyst (Nafion perfluorinated powdered resin and Nafion perfluorinated
ion-exchange resin in 10 wt % dispersion in water); however, the yields
were significantly lower with the increased formation of the C2 prenylated
isomeric side product (see Scheme 1). Furthermore, we were concerned about the Nafion
catalyst (containing super acidic sites) dehydrating isophytol to
form undesirable phytadienes,40 which presumably
contribute to it being a less desirable catalyst for this purpose.

An interesting feature of MKs is the possibility of geometric isomer
formation (Figure 2A,B). The biologically active trans isomer of vitamin K1 is the natural biological form of vitamin K1.27 Evidence also demonstrates that biological MKs
have an all-trans configuration of the double bonds within the isoprenyl
side chain.27 The geometric isomers of
vitamin K1, MK-7 and MK-9(II-H2) (isolated from M. phlei, Figure 1A), have been successfully separated; therefore, efforts
to isolate the trans isomer of MK-2(II-H2) from its cis
isomer byproduct (Figure 2B) were carried out.16,24,27 MK-2(II-H2) 3 was initially isolated as
a 2.7:1 mixture of trans/cis isomers (by NMR integration of alkene
peaks in benzene-d6) after column chromatography.
The trans isomer of MK-2(II-H2) 3 can be isolated
using preparative TLC, similar to reports for vitamin K1 analogues44 and MK analogues.16

The successful separation of the
trans isomer of 3 by preparative TLC allowed for characterization
of a single pure
geometric isomer of MK-2(II-H2), Figure 2. The structural assignment of trans-MK-2(II-H2) (Figure 2) was elucidated using two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopic
methods [1H–1H correlation spectroscopy
(COSY) and 1H–13C heteronuclear single
quantum correlation (HSQC) spectroscopy; see the Supporting Information for spectra, Figures S1–S4.1
and S7–S8.1]. Spectra obtained in benzene-d6 (C6D6) result in less overlap
of the NMR signals for the cis/trans isomer mixture (Figure 2C,D), compared to CDCl3 where some of the geometric isomer peaks overlap (e.g., cis/trans
alkene protons coalesce in CDCl3) and the formation of
isomers is not obvious. Therefore, the use of C6D6 as a diagnostic NMR solvent for the evaluation of cis/trans mixtures
for MK analogues was critical and is in line with a recently reported
NMR analysis of cis/trans isomer mixtures of MK-724 (see the Supporting Information for spectra in CDCl3 versus C6D6, Figure S40).

Synthesis and Characterization of MK-2(I,II-H4)
The fully saturated isoprenyl MK analogue, MK-2(I,II-H4) 7, was synthesized in three steps from commercially
available 3,7-dimethyloctan-1-ol 4 (Scheme 2). The first step converted
aliphatic alcohol 4 to the mesylate, which was then subjected
to an SN2 reaction using NaI to yield 1-iodo-3,7-dimethyloctane 5 in 47% yield over two steps.38 The alkyl iodide 5 was then coupled to menadione 6 via radical alkylation using benzoyl peroxide37 as a radical initiator to yield MK-2(I,II-H4) 7 in 17% yield. The yield for the coupling
reaction is close in range with that reported in the literature for
other coupling reactions for the synthesis of MK analogues.26,27,38 The unreacted alkyl iodide 5 can be recovered during column chromatography. In an effort
to ensure selectivity of prenylation at C3 versus C2 (Scheme 2), the slow addition of napthoquinone 6 during the reaction was carried out so that the naphthoquinone
stationary concentration in the reaction mixture is low compared to
the prenyl iodide concentration.37 MK-2(I,II-H4) 7 was obtained as a yellow oil. This is the
first report of the synthesis and characterization of MK-2(I,II-H4) 7 (see the Supporting Information for the 2D NMR spectra, Figures S13–S14.1), the fully saturated
analogue of MK-2.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Scheme for the Three-Step Synthesis To Obtain
MK-2(I,II-H4) 7
The
first step forms the mesylate
from 4. The second step forms aliphatic iodide 5 via a SN2 reaction. The final step couples menadione 6 and aliphatic iodide 5 using a radical alkylation
initiated by benzoyl peroxide.

Synthesis and
Characterization of MK-3(II-H2)
The partially
saturated isoprenyl MK analogue, MK-3(II-H2) 13, was synthesized in seven steps from commercially
available β-citronellol 8 (Scheme 3) via a modified adaptation of a combination
of a reported synthesis of MK-4(II-H2)38 and a less recent 1965 synthesis of MK-3(II-H2).33 First, the hydroxyl group of β-citronellol 8 was converted into iodide 9 through methane
sulfonate in 66% yield over two steps.38 The introduction of a carbonyl group to produce citronellylacetone 10 was accomplished under basic conditions in 88% yield over
two steps.45 This was followed by a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reaction to give methyl ester 11 in 62% yield.38 Reduction of 11 with the Vitride
reagent produced 6,7-dihydrofarnesol 12 in 83% yield.38,46 Finally, MK-3(II-H2) 13 was obtained from
the BF3-catalyzed coupling between the partially saturated
allylic alcohol 12 and menadiol 1 (prepared
from menadione)26,38 in 12% yield.26,38 The low yield may be attributed to the formation of the undesired
C2 isomeric side product (see Scheme 3), which was readily separated using column chromatography.
MK-3(II-H2) 13 was obtained as a yellow oil.

Scheme 3 Synthetic Scheme for the Seven-Step Synthesis To Obtain MK-3(II-H2) 13 from β-Citronellol 8(33,38)
Similar to MK-2(II-H2) 3, MK-3(II-H2) 13 was initially
isolated as a 2.7:1 mixture
(by NMR integration of alkene peaks in C6D6)
of trans/cis isomers. However, the trans isomer (Figure 3A) can be isolated from the
cis isomer byproduct (Figure 3B) using preparative TLC, similar to a report on cis/trans
vitamin K1 analogues.44 MK analogues
can be very sensitive; for example, during purification, we observed
degradation of trans-MK-3(II-H2) (Figure 3A) within a solution
of dichloromethane (DCM) that was not stabilized with amylene. This
was evidenced by a decreased integration value for the alkene proton
at 5.19 ppm and the appearance of two extra peaks at ∼1.3 ppm
and a peak at 1.12 ppm in C6D6. Amylene is a
radical scavenger, and it is likely that the alkene is undergoing
a radical reaction with chloride radicals present in the unstabilized
DCM. Similar to MK-2(II-H2) 3, the use of
benzene-d6 as a diagnostic NMR solvent
for the evaluation of cis/trans mixtures of MK-3(II-H2) 13 (Figure 3C,D) was essential because the presence of the cis isomer was not
well-observed in CDCl3 (see the Supporting Information for spectra in CDCl3 vs benzene-d6, Figure S40).

mixture of cis/trans-MK-3(II-H2) and trans-MK-3(II-H2) in C6D6 at 25 °C. (A) Structure of trans-MK-3(II-H2) with the proton labeling scheme key, (B)
structure of cis-MK-3(II-H2), (C) 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the cis/trans mixture of MK-3(II-H2) in C6D6, and (D) 1D 1H NMR spectrum
of trans-MK-3(II-H2) in C6D6. Overlapping cis/trans peaks have been left unlabeled.

The structural assignment of trans-MK-3(II-H2) (Figure 3) was elucidated using 2D NMR spectroscopic
methods [1H–1H COSY, 1H–13C
HSQC, and 1H–1H rotating frame Overhauser
effect spectroscopy (ROESY); see the Supporting Information for spectra, Figures S23–S26.1 and S29–S31].
The assignment of the alkene proton Hh at 5.13 ppm was
determined by the following: the observation of a cross peak in the
COSY spectrum at 5.13 and 1.73 ppm (assignment Hw, Figure 3), the observation
of a cross peak at 5.13 and 1.94 ppm (assignment Hn, Figure 3), and the lack of
an observed cross peak at 5.19 and 1.73 ppm (Hw). The assignment
of alkene proton Hi at 5.19 ppm was determined by the observation
of a cross peak at 5.19 and 1.67 ppm and the lack of a cross peak
at 5.19 and 1.73 ppm (Hw). 1H–1H 2D ROESY NMR spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information) also supported the alkene assignment by the observation
of a ROE cross peak at 5.19 and 1.67 ppm (Hi–Hz interaction) and the lack of a ROE cross peak at 5.19 ppm
and 1.56 ppm. The assignment of the terminal methyl groups, Hy and Hz, was also determined by 1H–1H 2D ROESY NMR spectroscopy. It is anticipated that a ROE
cross peak would be observed between the alkene proton Hi and the methyl group, that is, cis to Hi, because of
the close spatial proximity, and a ROE cross peak is observed, as
expected, at 5.19 and 1.67 ppm (Hi–Hz interaction) (see the Supporting Information). Although Hy and Hi are within the spatial
limits of an expected ROE cross peak observation, an ROE cross peak
is not observed at 5.19 ppm and 1.56 ppm. This supports the structural
assignment of Hy as trans to the alkene proton Hi, as Hy is further away, spatially, from Hi compared to Hz.

Synthesis and Characterization of MK-3(I,II,III-H6)
The fully saturated isoprenyl MK analogue, MK-3(I,II,III-H6) 17, was synthesized in four steps (Scheme 4) from the commercially
available allylic alcohol, farnesol 14. The first step
was the Pd- catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of farnesol to yield
the fully saturated alcohol 15 in 88% yield.47 Subsequent mesylation of the alcohol of product 15 followed by substitution with NaI gave aliphatic iodide 16 in 47% yield over two steps.38,48 The final
step was the radical coupling of menadione 6 and aliphatic
iodide 16 using benzoyl peroxide37 as the radical initiator to yield the desired final product, MK-3(I,II,III-H6) 17, in 15% yield. This yield is similar to
that attained for the coupling reaction to obtain MK-2(I,II-H4) 7. The unreacted aliphatic iodide 16 can be recovered during purification. Similar to MK-2(I,II-H4) 7, in an attempt to ensure good selectivity
of prenylation (C3 over C2, Scheme 4), slow addition of napthoquinone 6 to
the prenyl iodide solution during the course of the reaction was carried
out.37 Similar to the synthesis of MK-2(I,II-H4) 7 above, this is the second report of this
type of primary alkyl radical coupling reaction to access MK and the
first report on a preparatory scale. MK-3(I,II,III-H6) 17 was obtained as a yellow oil. This is the first report
for the synthesis and characterization of MK-3(I,II,III-H6) 17 (see the Supporting Information for 2D NMR spectra, Figures S38–S39.1), the fully saturated
analogue of MK-3.

Scheme 4 Synthetic Scheme for the Four-Step Synthesis To Obtain
MK-3(I,II,III-H6) 17
The
first step is a transfer
hydrogenation to produce the fully saturated alcohol 15 from farnesol 14. The second step forms the mesylate
from 15. The third step forms aliphatic iodide 16 via a SN2 reaction. The final step couples menadione 6 and aliphatic iodide 16 using a radical alkylation
initiated by benzoyl peroxide.

Conclusions
The results of these studies will allow for the synthesis of various
MK analogues and give access to previously unexplored compounds with
unknown biological activity. In summary, this manuscript described
the synthesis and characterization of four truncated partially and
fully saturated isoprenyl MK analogues as well as separated and characterized
the geometric isomers formed in the reactions. The partially saturated
MK-2(II-H2) was successfully synthesized in a single step
from menadiol and isophytol, and the trans isomer was separated from
the cis isomer byproduct by preparative TLC, followed by characterization.
The novel fully saturated MK-2(I,II-H4) was successfully
synthesized in three steps from 3,7-dimethyloctan-1-ol. The partially
saturated MK-3(II-H2) was successfully synthesized in seven
steps from β-citronellol, and the trans isomer was readily separated
from the cis isomer byproduct by preparative TLC, followed by characterization.
Finally, the novel fully saturated MK-3(I,II,III-H6) was
successfully synthesized in four steps from farnesol. The use of benzene-d6 as a diagnostic NMR solvent for the rapid
evaluation of cis/trans mixtures for MK/vitamin K analogues was essential
as cis/trans peaks often coalesce in chloroform-d.

The separation and characterization of an MK analogue’s
trans isomer is essential for use of these compounds in biological
systems or for understanding biological systems that use MK because
evidence shows that the cis isomer is not biologically active. The
partially and fully saturated MK analogues synthesized in this manuscript
are substrate analogues for enzymes involved in MK/vitamin K metabolism
and are essential for understanding the structure–activity
relationships of these biological systems.49 They are also critical for understanding the function, reactivity,
and conformation of partially saturated MK analogues as little is
currently known. These MK analogues are also of interest from a therapeutic
and medicinal standpoint. For instance, MK-4 (vitamin K2) was recently shown to be a potential new therapeutic strategy to
treat rheumatoid arthritis; it is a proposed drug for the effective
treatment of osteoporosis and has anticancer properties. Nevertheless,
the synthesis of partially saturated MK analogues remains a challenge
as there is currently not a suitable catalyst to selectively saturate
an individual isoprene unit on an MK analogue while leaving the other
double bonds unaffected. Importantly, the synthesis and characterization
of these partially and fully saturated MK substrate analogues is essential
for understanding why they are necessary for various organisms to
survive, and most importantly, understanding the reason MK-9(II-H2) (i.e., saturated at the second isoprene unit) is a potential
virulence factor for pathogenic M. tuberculosis, which is responsible for the deaths of ∼1.3 million people
annually.

Experimental Section
General Information
Menadiol 1 was synthesized
as previously described26,38 from menadione, and
the MgF2-48 sol–gel catalyst was synthesized, as
previously described.39−41 For clarity, any mention of MK-2(II-H2) or MK-3(II-H2) is assumed to be the cis/trans mixture,
whereas the trans isomer is specifically written as trans-MK-2(II-H2) or trans-MK-3(II-H2). We used the standard abbreviations adopted by the American Chemical
Society, for example, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH), distilled-deionized
water (DDI-H2O), chloroform-d (CDCl3), benzene-d6 (C6D6), equivalent (equiv), room temperature (r.t.), Rf (retention factor), high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS), calculated (calcd), megahertz (MHz), Hz (hertz), and so forth.

methods and information, materials, and one-dimensional (1D) and 2D
NMR spectra of synthesized compounds.

NMR Spectroscopic Studies
The synthesized compounds
were dried under vacuum for ∼2–4 days (∼150–200
mTorr), unless otherwise noted, to ensure as much residual solvent
from purification was removed as possible. Samples for NMR studies
were prepared immediately prior to running the samples using deuterated
solvents sealed under an inert atmosphere in glass ampules. The NMR
sample solutions were placed under an argon atmosphere immediately
and capped, and then the spectra were acquired, unless otherwise noted.
NMR samples of MKs were protected from light by wrapping the samples
in an aluminum foil while not in the NMR instrument because of potential
degradation. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded
using a Varian model MR400 or a Bruker model AVANCE Neo400 spectrometer
equipped with a BBFO smart probe and an automated tuning module operating
at 400 or 101 MHz, respectively. Chemical shift values (δ) are
reported in ppm and referenced against the internal solvent peaks

Mass Spectrometry and Elemental Analysis
HRMS experiments
were conducted either on an Agilent 6224 TOF LC/MS [O-time-of-flight
(TOF)] interfaced with the Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) source
(IonSense DART-100) or on a Bruker MaXis TOF MS (Q-TOF) interfaced
with the DART source (IonSense DART-SVP). A standard of Jeffamine
was used as an internal standard calibration for HRMS DART experiments
carried out in the positive mode. Combustion elemental analysis was
carried out by ALS Environmental located in Tucson, AZ.

Preparation
of 2-(3,7-Dimethyloct-2-en-1-yl)-3-methylnaphthalene-1,4-dione
MK-2(II-H2) (3)
To a dry 150 mL round-bottom
thick-walled pressure flask was added a dry stir bar, dry heptane
(21 mL), and polyene carbonate (21 mL). The solution was bubbled with
argon for several min. Then, menadiol 1 (1.22 g, 7.00
mmol) was added and stirred until dissolution occurred under argon
bubbling. Then, isophytol 2 (1.09 g, 7.00 mmol) was added,
followed by MgF2-48 (350 mg). The biphasic reaction mixture
was bubbled with argon for ∼1 min and then sealed tightly with
a Teflon screw cap. The sealed reaction mixture was covered in an
aluminum foil to minimize light exposure and was stirred for 5 h at
100 °C under an argon atmosphere. The yellow biphasic suspension
was then cooled to an ambient temperature. The 1H NMR spectrum
of the crude product confirmed product formation by the presence of
a doublet at 3.37 ppm (CDCl3). The layers were separated,
and the polyene carbonate layer (bottom layer) was extracted with n-pentane (3 × 100 mL). The combined yellow organic
extracts were washed with DDI H2O (100 mL), washed with
sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), washed with brine (100 mL), dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under
reduced pressure at an ambient temperature. The crude oil was dried
overnight under reduced pressure to yield 1.31 g of crude red oil.
The crude red oil was purified by flash column chromatography (300
mL of 230–400 mesh SiO2, 20:1 n-pentane/EtOAc, 40 mm column) to yield 0.235 g (0.757 mmol, 10.8%
yield) as a yellow/red oil after drying under vacuum (200 mTorr).
The C2 isomeric side product was readily separated by flash column
chromatography eluting after the C3 desired product. The product was
obtained as a mixture of trans/cis isomers (ratio of trans/cis = 2.7:1
by NMR integration of alkene peaks), as has similarly been reported
for vitamin K1 analogues44 and
various MK analogues.271H NMR

A sample for analytical characterization of trans-MK-2(II-H2) was purified by normal phase
preparative TLC (see experimental below) on silica gel using (30:1) n-pentane/EtOAc as the eluting solvent; Rf cis: 0.37, Rf trans: 0.32;
ratio of trans/cis before separation was 2.7:1 (the ratio was measured
from the NMR integration of alkene peaks). Although we isolated the
pure trans isomer, the cis isomer coeluted with the trans isomer,
and efforts to obtain a sample of the pure cis isomer were not successful.

A sample for analytical
characterization of trans-MK-2(II-H2)
was prepared by using normal phase preparative
TLC. First, 8.0 mg of cis/trans-MK-2(II-H2) (dissolved in a minimal amount of DCM) was loaded onto a
preparative TLC plate via a capillary tube and then eluted once using
30:1 n-pentane/EtOAc and an elution time of 45 min.
The TLC plate was briefly air-dried and then eluted a second time
under the same conditions. The yellow band was illuminated under ultraviolet
light, and while illuminated, the band was divided into a top two-third
and a bottom one-third. The bottom one-third was carefully removed
with a razor blade, extracted with DCM, filtered through a disposable
Pasteur pipette filled with glass wool (prerinsed with DCM), concentrated
under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature, and dried for 4
days at reduced pressure (200 mTorr) to provide 2.5 mg of trans-MK-2(II-H2) as a yellow oil (31.3% recovery).

2-Methyl-3-(3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,10-dien-1-yl)naphthalene-1,4-dione
MK-3(II-H2) (13)
To a 100 mL round-bottom
Schlenk flask was added a stir bar, EtOAc (16 mL), and 1,4 dioxane
(16 mL), and then the flask was purged/evacuated with argon repeatedly.
Then, menadiol 1 (2.50 g, 11.5 mmol, 4:1 menadiol/menadione
by NMR integration in CDCl3, menadiol is unstable in CDCl3) and 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,10-dien-1-ol 12 (2.81 g, 12.5 mmol, 1.09 equiv) were added followed by dropwise
addition of distilled BF3 etherate (0.8 mL, fresh bottle)
under argon. The reaction mixture refluxed at 70 °C for 3 h under
argon. The reaction mixture turned dark orange and was quenched with
ice–DDI H2O (100 mL) and then extracted with diethyl
ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined yellow organic extracts were
washed with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), washed with DDI H2O (100 mL), washed with brine (100 mL), dried with anhydrous
Na2SO4, and then concentrated under reduced
pressure at an ambient temperature to yield 5.06 g of the crude red
solid. The crude solid was purified by flash column chromatography
(1000 mL of 230–400 mesh SiO2, 20:1 n-pentane/EtOAc) to yield 1.28 g (yield at this stage = 29.4%, 3.38
mmol) as a red oil, but further purification was needed as evidenced
by 1H NMR analysis. The C2 isomeric side product was readily
separated by flash column chromatography eluting after the C3 desired
product. The red oil was subjected to a second column chromatography
purification using the same conditions as the first purification,
and then the material was dried under reduced pressure (150 mTorr)
overnight to yield 0.501 g (1.32 mmol, 11.5% yield) as a yellow oil.
Similar to vitamin K1 analogues,44 various MK analogues27 and MK-2(II-H2) 3, the product was obtained as a mixture of
trans/cis isomers (ratio of trans/cis = 2.7:1 by NMR integration of
alkene peaks). 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6): δ 8.00–8.07 (m, 2H), 7.01–7.06 (m, 2H), 5.27

A sample for analytical characterization
of trans-MK-3(II-H2) was prepared similarly
as described (see experimental below) for trans-MK-2(II-H2) above by normal phase preparative TLC on silica gel using
(30:1) n-pentane/EtOAc as the eluting solvent; Rf cis: 0.35, Rf trans:
0.30; ratio of trans/cis before separation was 2.7:1 (ratio by NMR
integration of alkene peaks). Importantly, the bottom one-half of
the band was isolated, instead of the bottom one-third of the band
as was done to obtain trans-MK-2(II-H2). This purification provided 3.7 mg of trans-MK-3(II-H2) as a yellow oil (43.5% recovery) from the initial 8.5 mg
cis/trans mixture loaded onto the TLC plate after drying under vacuum
(200 mTorr) for 4 days. Similar to MK-2(II-H2) 3, we isolated the pure trans isomer; however, the cis isomer coeluted
with the trans isomer, and efforts to obtain a sample of the pure
cis isomer were not successful. Similar to MK-2(II-H2) 3, the cis and trans isomers of MK-3(II-H2) have
different NMR spectra in C6D6 for the protons
and carbons that belong to the isoprenyl side chain. Data for trans-MK-3(II-H2): 1H NMR (400 MHz,

Compound 17 was accessed
through compounds 15 and 16 starting from
commercially available
compound 14.

3,7,11-Trimethyldodecan-1-ol (15)
To a
dry 500 mL round-bottom Schlenk flask was added a dry stir bar, dry
methanol (200 mL), ammonium formate (29.15 g, 462.3 mmol, 9.28 equiv),
and farnesol 14 (11.08 g, 49.83 mmol), followed by careful
addition of the palladium catalyst by a funnel (2.14 g, 20.1 mmol,
0.4 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred at an ambient temperature
for 5 days under positive pressure from an argon balloon, and 1H NMR analysis showed only residual alkene present. The reaction
mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and washed with MeOH
(600 mL). MeOH was removed under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature.
The crude product was then filtered through a silica plug (4:1 n-pentane/EtOAc, 500 mL eluent) and washed with EtOAc (300
mL). The organic filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure
at an ambient temperature to yield a crude clear and colorless oil.
The crude oil was suspended in diethyl ether (200 mL), washed with
sat. NaHCO3 (200 mL), washed with brine (100 mL), dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, and then concentrated
under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature to yield a crude
clear and colorless oil. The crude oil was purified by flash column
chromatography (1000 mL of 230–400 mesh SiO2, 4:1 n-pentane/EtOAc, 70 mm column) to yield 9.99 g (43.7 mmol,
87.8% yield) as a clear and colorless oil after drying under vacuum
(150 mTorr). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ
3.63–3.73 (m, 2H), 1.49–1.63 (m, 3H), 1.01–1.42

1-Iodo-3,7,11-trimethyldodecane
(16)
To
a dry 250 mL round-bottom Schlenk flask was added a dry stir bar,
3,7,11-trimethyldodecan-1-ol 15 (9.41 g, 41.2 mmol),
and dry DCM (125 mL). The flask was purged/evacuated with argon repeatedly.
The solution was cooled to 0 °C in an ice–H2O bath. Then, dry triethylamine (8.61 mL, 6.25 g, 61.8 mmol, 1.5
equiv) was added to the flask followed by dropwise addition of methanesulfonyl
chloride (3.82 mL, 5.66 g, 49.4 mmol, 1.2 equiv) at 0 °C for
over 5 min while stirring under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred
at an ambient temperature for 40 min under argon. The off-white reaction
mixture was quenched with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), and then
the phases were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl
ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed
with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), washed with brine (100 mL),
dried over anhydrous MgSO4, vacuum-filtered, and then concentrated
under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature (residual triethylamine
can be removed by vacuum pumping for ∼1 h) to yield 12.98 g
of crude clear and light-yellow oil. To another dry 250 mL round-bottom
Schlenk flask was added dry and degassed acetone (100 mL, dried over
anhydrous K2CO3 for ∼10 min immediately
prior) and crude mesylate followed by NaI (15.44 g, 103.0 mmol, 2.5
equiv). The reaction mixture turned bright yellow upon addition of
NaI and was refluxed for 1 h and 40 min under argon. The yellow reaction
mixture was diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL) and DDI H2O (100 mL), and then the phases were separated. The aqueous layer
was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic
extracts were washed with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), washed
with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, vacuum-filtered,
and then concentrated under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature
to yield a crude yellow murky oil. To remove the salt impurities,
the crude oil was suspended in n-pentane (100 mL)
and washed with DDI H2O (100 mL), and then the phases were
separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with n-pentane (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed
with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL), washed with brine (100 mL),
dried over anhydrous MgSO4, vacuum-filtered, and then concentrated
under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature to yield 13.19 g
of crude clear and light-yellow oil. The crude oil was purified by
flash column chromatography (1000 mL of 230–400 mesh SiO2, 100% n-pentane, Rf = 0.71, 70 mm column) to yield 6.52 g (19.3 mmol, 46.8% yield)
after drying under vacuum (200 mTorr) as a clear and colorless oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 3.14–3.28

2-Methyl-3-(3,7,11-trimethyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,4-dione
MK-3(I,II,III,H6) (17)
To a dry 100
mL round-bottom
Schlenk flask was added under argon, a dry stir bar, dry and degassed
benzene (30 mL), and 1-iodo-3,7,11-trimethyldodecane 16 (3.38 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv). To a dry 20 mL vial was added benzene
(15 mL), which was degassed via argon needle purge, followed by menadione 6 (1.72 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and benzoyl peroxide (2.42
g, 10.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and then sonicated until dissolution occurred
under argon. The naphthoquinone–benzoyl peroxide solution was
added dropwise to the refluxing prenyl iodide solution for over 2
h and 15 min while the reaction mixture was refluxing under argon.
The solution was then refluxed for an additional 1 h. The reaction
mixture was diluted with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL) and DDI H2O (100 mL), and then the phases were separated. The aqueous
layer was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined
yellow organic extracts were washed with sat. NaHCO3 (100
mL), washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure at an ambient temperature
to yield 6.63 g of crude yellow powder. The crude product was purified
by flash column chromatography (1000 mL of 230–400 mesh SiO2, 10:1 n-pentane/EtOAc, 70 mm column) to
yield 0.555 g (1.45 mmol, 14.5% yield) after drying under vacuum (200
