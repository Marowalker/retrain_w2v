Electronic structure
of nearly stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric
clusters of ZnO having bulk-like wurtzite geometry passivated with
fictitious hydrogen atoms are comparatively analyzed for structural
evolution using density functional theory-based electronic structure
calculations. A parameter, average binding energy per atomic number
(ABE-number), is introduced for better insight of structural evolution.
The stability of a cluster is determined by binding energy per atom
and ABE-number, whereas structural evolution on the basis of spin-polarized
energy spectrum is studied via site projected partial density of states
(l-DOS). The overall structural evolution is mapped for bare and passivated
ZnO clusters to l-DOS. The study has established a correlation between
the stability of clusters and their l-DOS. O-excess and O-surfaced
clusters are found to be more stable. The HOMO–LUMO gap varies
from 0 to 6.3 eV by tuning the size, composition, and surface termination
of the clusters. Present results reported for clusters of sizes up
to ∼1 nm can pave a path for formulating strategies for experimental
synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles for tuning the HOMO–LUMO gap.

Introduction
With technological
advent, synthesizing nanoparticles with control
over size and shape has provided impetus for applications as well
as fundamental research to understand the underlying science. In the
nanoregime, the symmetries of the system are lowered and with the
new boundary conditions, additional surface states appear. Reduced
surface coordination adopts new kind of bonding which leads to significant
variation in the electronic properties of nanomaterials. Extensive
attention has been paid to understand such dominant surface effects
in low-dimensional systems. Passivation of the surface of clusters
has been shown to lead to bulk-like geometry with marginal reconstruction
of geometry near the surface.1,2 Such geometric structures
mimicking bulk-like environment can weaken the effect of surface,
thus enabling one to look at the energy spectrum of clusters and its
variation with size in a bulk-like environment.

ZnO is extensively
studied and used for diversified applications
such as diluted magnetic semiconductor material, cluster-assembled
material, material for optoelectronic devices, and antibiotic material.3−9 The reported antimicrobial activity of ZnO nanoparticles is due
to their ability to produce increased levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) at the surface of particles, mostly hydroxyl radicals, H2O2 and atomic oxygen. The level of activity was
found to enhance with reduction in the particle size.7,8,10 Such ROS at the surface of nanoparticles,
in principle, can be further increased by exploiting nonstoichiometric
nature. This demands further studies of ZnO nanostructures with nonstoichiometric
nature to understand the possibilities of tuning various properties
governed by surface, constituents, and geometrical structure of nanomaterials.

Theoretical calculations of stoichiometric bare clusters of ZnO
with number of atoms as low as 52 are reported to prefer bulk-like
geometry.11 Experimentally synthesized
clusters are normally nonstoichiometric; at least the mass spectra
of very small ZnO clusters have demonstrated so.9 Experiments have also demonstrated the geometrical structure
of nanoparticles to be bulk-like in the interior with reconstruction
at the surface because of unsatisfied valency.1 Experimental synthesis of heterostructure materials in nanoregime
is likely to have inbuilt nonstoichiometry because of difference in
electronegativity and/or excess of one of the constituents during
synthesis along with other synthesis parameters. It is possible to
have nonstoichiometric ZnO nanostructures having geometry with excess
of oxygen at the surface because of comparatively high electronegativity
of O.12 For synthesis of ZnO nanostructures,
N capping dodecylamine, trioctylamine and O-capping trioctylphosphine
oxide, and acetate ligands are commonly used.13 Experimentally synthesized clusters of ZnO have been characterized
by mass spectroscopy and high intensities of oxygen-rich clusters,
and almost no oxygen-deficient clusters have been reported.9,14−16 The reason for such a behavior was not explained,
and the present study attempts to provide an explanation. Theoretical
and experimental studies of adsorption of Zn and O on ZnO polar surfaces
have explored formation of nonstoichiometric clusters at the surface
of ZnO, with preferred adsorption of O atoms.17 Although ZnO has been studied extensively experimentally and theoretically
in bulk, as thin films or small- and medium-sized bare stoichiometric
clusters, very little attention has been paid to nonstoichiometric
clusters and to the effect of passivation. The present study aims
to fulfill this gap and to provide impetus for chemical synthesis
of small ZnO nanoparticles with appropriate ligands to satisfy the
polar surface. Experimentally, of course, there are limitations for
accurate structural measurements of degree of nonstoichiometry.

Debnath et al., in their density functional theory (DFT) study
on role of passivators on the stoichiometry of CdSe and GaAs nanocrystals,
have reported that nonstoichiometric (either cation-rich or anion-rich)
nanocrystals are favored over stoichiometric ones because of preferential
strong bonding of the passivating ligands with either cations or anions.18 However, for bare nanocrystals, stoichiometric
structures are favored over nonstoichiometric ones, but they are unstable.
They have argued that strong interaction between the surface atoms
of the nanocrystals and passivators leads to nonstoichiometric clusters
because the surface states of less coordinated atoms lie deeper on
passivation and cause larger gain in energy.

Stoichiometric
clusters of ZnO are known to have arrangement of
alternate layers of Zn and O.19 Also similar
phenomenon is observed for other II–VI and III–V binary
compound clusters.20,21 Azpiroz et al. have used Car–Parrinello
molecular dynamics followed by local geometry optimization for computational
modeling of ZnS and ZnO nanostructures starting from bulk wurtzite
geometry.1 They report fully optimized
nanostructures of size ∼1.5 nm retaining wurtzite interior
with surface reconstruction. They have also concluded that choice
of surface passivator does not affect the energy spectrum. Chen et
al. have found global minimum energy structures of (ZnO)n, n ≤ 168 using a hybrid
genetic algorithm followed by local geometry optimization at DFT level.22 They have attributed the relatively high stability
of multilayered particles to lack of terminal atoms and effective
interlayer stacking of hexagonal cells. To this end, in the present
study, we have undertaken the bottom to top approach for ZnO nanostructures
by building atom-centered nonstoichiometric clusters having alternate
nearest neighbors of Zn and O atoms pertaining to bulk-like geometry.
The generated structures resemble hexagonal stacking of layers. Such
clusters can form inside the bulk regime as well as in the form of
colloids under the influence of capping agents or ligands. To mimic
the capping and to satisfy dangling bonds at the surface, fictitious
hydrogen atoms are used as passivators in the present work.

Similar attempts are reported for other II–VI semiconductor
materials but are mainly focused on comparative study of wurtzite
versus zinc blend (ZB) structures.23 In
this endeavor, present work has been carried out to study and understand
the effect of nonstoichiometry and passivation on the evolution of
small ZnO clusters in bulk-like wurtzite geometry, with in-built nonstoichiometry.
Because of the underlying motive, large-sized clusters (n > 153) are not considered in the present study.

Results and Discussion
Most of the II–VI semiconductors, in particular the oxides
and chalcogenides, occur in the ZB or wurtzite (W) phase in bulk and
in nanosize regime. For ZnO, the ZB phase occurs in bulk only at high
pressure and there are no reports to our knowledge of ZnO quantum
dots in the ZB phase. Therefore, in the present study, nonstoichiometric
atom-centered clusters of ZnO are built with bulk-like wurtzite geometry
by adding alternate layers of Zn and O as near neighbor shells, referred
to as layers. Clusters are built with structure parameters a = 3.25 Å, c = 5.069 Å, and u = 0.382. Zn-centered clusters Zn1O4, Zn13O4, Zn13O29, Zn57O29, and Zn57O96 are shown
in Figure 1a–d,l,
respectively. In a similar manner O-centered counterpart clusters
Zn4O1, Zn4O13, Zn29O13, Zn29O57, and Zn96O57 are formed wherein Zn and O atoms are interchanged.
To understand and compare the variation in the stability with size
and contribution of nonstoichiometry, atom-centered nearly stoichiometric
clusters are formed by cutting chunk of bulk wurtzite ZnO of requisite
radii. Thus, Zn-centered clusters Zn13O14, Zn19O20, and Zn51O41 are formed
along with their O-centered counterparts Zn14O13, Zn20O19, and Zn41O51.

Figure 1 Geometries of unpassivated and passivated clusters of Zn atom-centered
nonstoichiometric ZnO clusters up to 5 layers (center atom considered
as layer 1). O atom-centered clusters are similar where Zn and O atoms
have been interchanged and passivation is done by appropriate fictitious
hydrogen atoms. The Zn, O, and fictitious hydrogen atoms H** and H*
are represented by magenta (larger), brown (small), and blue and silver
(tiny) balls, respectively. The same color code is followed for all
figures.

The binding energies (BE)/atom and ABE-number of Zn- and
O-centered
nonstoichiometric and nearly stoichiometric clusters are summarized
in Table 1. Text in
the parentheses show layer wise distribution of atoms. From Table 1, it is clear that
the BE/atom and ABE-number of the nonstoichiometric clusters show
increasing trend with increasing size for both the Zn- and O-centered
clusters. Overall, the BE/atom for nearly stoichiometric clusters
is comparatively more positive than nearby nonstoichiometric clusters,
indicating higher stability of nearly stoichiometric clusters irrespective
of the nature of the central atom. A clear distinction of comparatively
larger BE/atom for nonstoichiometric O-surfaced clusters than their
Zn-surfaced counterparts (ΔBE/atom = EZnnOm – EZnmOn, n < m) is observed. This difference is observed to decrease
with the increase in size because of the decrease in surface to bulk
atom ratio.

a ΔBE/atom in the
fourth column represents the difference in BE/atom of a O-surfaced
cluster and its Zn-surfaced counterpart cluster. Results of ground
state of stoichiometric Zn24O24 cluster are
also incorporated for comparison. The last three columns list the
HOMO–LUMO gaps for up and down spins (H↑,
H↓) and the magnetic moment (M)
respectively.

It is difficult
to distinguish the surface layer for nearly stoichiometric
clusters because they are not formed layer-by-layer but are cut from
the bulk, and therefore, they have few Zn and few O atoms at nearly
same distances from the central atom. We have therefore considered
atoms in the last two layers as surface atoms. The BE/atom is significantly
larger for nearly stoichiometric clusters in comparison to nonstoichiometric
clusters of comparable sizes. BE/atom is larger for O-dominant surfaced
clusters than Zn-dominant surfaced clusters as is observed for nonstoichiometric
clusters (except for Zn13O14 and Zn14O13 clusters). Notable difference is ΔBE/atom values for nearly stoichiometric clusters are comparatively smaller
than for nonstoichiometric clusters and increase with size for nearly
stoichiometric clusters. A point to be noted in this regard is, in
Zn13O14 (Zn14O13) cluster,
there are nearly equal number of Zn and O atoms in the last two layers,
whereas in the other two clusters, Zn19O20 (Zn20O19) and Zn51O41 (Zn41O51), the number of O (Zn) atoms is larger than
the number of Zn (O) atoms. Thus, O dominance increases with size
of clusters and is reflected in ΔBE/atom values.
Thus, it is safe to conclude that O-surfaced clusters are more stable
than Zn-surfaced clusters, irrespective of the nature of the central
atom and the degree of nonstoichiometry. Generally, ABE-numbers are
large (∼0.7–0.9) for O-surfaced clusters while small
(∼0.15–0.6) for Zn-surfaced nonstoichiometric clusters.
Thus, stability is related to the large values of ABE-number. For
O-surfaced clusters, ABE-number monotonically increases with the number
of O atoms whether the clusters are nonstoichiometric or nearly stoichiometric,
whereas for Zn-surfaced clusters, such a trend is observed for nonstoichiometric
clusters only. ABE-numbers are larger for nearly stoichiometric clusters
irrespective of nature of atoms on the surface. ABE-number is thus
a better parameter than BE/atom for comparing the stability of nonstoichiometric
and nearly stoichiometric O- and Zn-surfaced clusters.

As seen
from Table 1, HOMO–LUMO
gaps are smaller for Zn-surfaced clusters as expected
from the stability behavior. In most of the clusters, the HOMO–LUMO
gap for down spin is very small indicating a metal-like behavior.
O-dominant clusters possess large magnetic moments (∼2 μB per excess O atom). Figure 2 displays the spin density plots originating on the
O sites. Surprisingly Zn-dominant and nearly stoichiometric clusters
also possess nonzero magnetic moment because of unsatisfied valency.

Figure 2 Spin density
plots for small ZnO clusters.

From the discussions above and data presented in Table 1, it is seen that
Zn13O29 and Zn29O57 have
larger values
for BE/atom, ABE-number and HOMO–LUMO gaps are comparatively
more; hence, these clusters are comparatively more stable. These cluster
sizes are neither too small nor too large. For larger clusters, the
surface gets bigger while for smaller clusters the degree of nonstoichiometry
is large. Experimentally, dangling bonds of the surface atoms are
satisfied by attaching organic ligands. This process provides stability
to the cluster and at the same time improves properties like band-edge
luminescence. Second, as seen in Table 1, unpassivated clusters generally show smaller HOMO–LUMO
gaps (except for few cases) and high values of magnetic moments because
of the presence of surface states in the gap region arising from the
dangling bonds. It is therefore important to passivate the clusters.
We have adopted process of passivation by fictitious hydrogen atoms
(H* and H**) which is computationally cheaper than using organic ligands.
The results for BE/atom, ABE-number, HOMO–LUMO gaps, and magnetic
moment are presented in Table 2 for passivated clusters. On passivation, the respective BE/atom
and ABE-number of clusters increase multifolds. The increase however
is found to be more for O-surfaced clusters. A trend of decrease of
stability of Zn- and O-surfaced clusters with increase in size can
be clearly seen. At a smaller size, the surface-to-volume ratio is
larger and hence the number of dangling bonds is larger. Because of
passivation, the dangling bonds are satisfied. This is clearly reflected
in the steep increase in BE/atom for small passivated nonstoichiometric
clusters. With the valency satisfied on passivation, majority of clusters
have zero magnetic moment and almost equal HOMO–LUMO gaps for
up and down spins. Only two Zn-surfaced clusters still have unsatisfied
valence and show nonzero magnetic moment and spin polarization and
lower BE/atom values because of less than requisite number of H**
atoms for passivation.

To understand the role of oxygen atoms (in terms of number in the
cluster), we define a quantity relative oxygen fraction (ROF) = NO/NT, where NT and NO are the
total number of atoms and number of oxygen atoms in a cluster, respectively.
Variation of BE/atom and ABE-number with ROF is plotted in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, for all clusters studied in this work. Trend
lines OA and OB are for bare Zn-surfaced and O-surfaced nonstoichiometric
clusters, respectively, whereas lines OD and OC are for respective
passivated clusters. The results for perfect stoichiometric bare and
passivated clusters from our earlier work39 are also incorporated for comparison purpose. The vertical line
(GOH) at ROF = 0.5 represents perfect stoichiometry. Nearly stoichiometric
clusters lie close to this line. The point (0.5, 3.785) in Figure 3 corresponds to bulk
ZnO. Passivated clusters have BE higher than the bulk value, whereas
unpassivated clusters have lower values. From Figure 3, it is evident that BE/atom increases with
size reaching toward bulk value for bare stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric
clusters. Comparing the nearly same-sized clusters, Zn1O4, Zn2O2 and Zn4O1, it is clear that Zn-surfaced nonstoichiometric clusters
are the least stable, while stoichiometric clusters are the most stable.
A similar trend can be observed for other similar-sized (Zn4O13, Zn8O8, Zn13O4) and (Zn13O29, Zn24O24, Zn29O13) clusters. The lower stability
of nonstoichiometric cluster geometries is due to dangling bonds on
the surface. This effect is dominant for small-sized clusters because
of higher surface-to-volume ratio. At the same time, it is clear that
O-surfaced (ROF > 0.5) clusters are comparatively more stable than
same-sized Zn-surfaced (ROF < 0.5) clusters. Lines OA and OB depict
the limit of nonstoichiometry for bare Zn-surfaced and O-surfaced
clusters in bulk-like geometry. Similarly, lines OD and OC mark the
limit for respective passivated clusters. Thus, bare Zn-surfaced nonstoichiometric
clusters will lie in the region bounded by lines OG and OA, bare O-surfaced
nonstoichiometric clusters will lie in the region bounded by lines
OG and OB, whereas passivated Zn-surfaced nonstoichiometric clusters
will lie in the region bounded by lines OH and OD, and passivated
O-surfaced nonstoichiometric clusters will lie in the region bounded
by lines OH and OC.

O atoms
(NO/NT) for
bare Zn-surfaced (OA), bare O-surfaced (OB), passivated O-surfaced
(OC) and passivated Zn-surfaced (OD) ZnO clusters. For comparison
BE/atom for bare (green diamond) and passivated (olive open circle)
stoichiometric clusters are also incorporated from ref (39). The lines are drawn to
show the trends.

Figure 4 Variation in ABE-number
as a function of ROF for bare Zn-surfaced
(OA), bare O-surfaced (OB), passivated O-surfaced (OC), and passivated
Zn-surfaced (OD) ZnO clusters. For comparison ABE-number for bare
(green diamond) and passivated (olive open circle) stoichiometric
clusters are also incorporated from ref (39).

Similar observations can be drawn by ABE-number variation
as shown
in Figure 4. A very
specific trend is seen in the values of ABE-number. Considering all
of the clusters (nonstoichiometric as well as nearly stoichiometric),
it is seen that the values of ABE-number increase with the number
of O atoms where the number of O atoms is more than the number of
Zn atoms and O atoms are on the surface. However, it is worth noting
that the effects are more prominent and bring out higher stability
of passivated O-surfaced clusters. Figure 3 seems to show symmetric behavior for respective
Zn- and O-surfaced clusters but Figure 4 features the dominance of passivated O-surfaced clusters
and relatively small variation with size for bare O-surfaced clusters.
Passivated stoichiometric clusters approach the bulk value comparatively
faster.

To study and understand the stability of passivated
nonstoichiometric
clusters, ionic relaxations (IRs) are performed for selected small
clusters (Zn1O4H12*, Zn4O13H36*, Zn13O29H64*, Zn13O14H19*H15**, Zn13O4H25**) (represented
by suffix—IR) to find nearest local minimum energy geometries.
The values of BE/atom and the HOMO–LUMO gap of these clusters
are listed in Table 3. The BE/atom and ABE-number for Zn1O4H12*-IR cluster are
found to be highest among all clusters whereas for respective Zn-surfaced
clusters, they are found to be lower. For O-surfaced passivated clusters,
the HOMO–LUMO gap is found to decrease with the increase in
size as expected. IR of small bare nonstoichiometric clusters did
not result in any stable geometries; however, after passivation, the
bulk-like wurtzite geometries are retained. This fact brings out the
important role of passivators or ligands for small clusters. Small
ZnO particles are known to undergo agglomeration.8 We ascribe this behavior to the presence of dangling bonds
at the O-surfaced clusters which are not completely satisfied by organic
ligands as demonstrated in theoretical results. It may be noted that
the values of BE/atom and ABE-number are marginally increased on IR
but the values of HOMO–LUMO gap have marginally decreased,
except for Zn13O29H64* cluster retaining the symmetry of electronic
structure for up and down spins. This further confirms higher stability
of Zn13O29H64* cluster.

We have not attempted to obtain the lowest energy structures for
the clusters studied in this work, but our results regarding the stability
analysis match with the results of Debnath et al.18 It can therefore be concluded that among the bare clusters
oxygen-rich and oxygen-surfaced clusters Zn1O4, Zn4O13, Zn13O29, Zn29O57, Zn57O96, Zn19O20, and Zn41O51 are more stable,
whereas among the passivated clusters, Zn13O29H64* is the
most stable.

The site projected partial density of states (l-DOS)
of nonstoichiometric
clusters along with their respective nearly similar-sized stoichiometric
neighbors is studied further to understand the variation in electronic
structure with size and structure. Figure 5 shows l-DOS for the bare clusters of (a)
Zn4O1, (b) Zn1O4 both
having wurtzite bulk-like geometry, and (c) Zn2O2 stoichiometric cluster in ground state along with their relaxed
passivated counterparts (d), (e), and (f), respectively.

(b) Zn1O4 with wurtzite geometry and stoichiometric
(c) Zn2O2 in ground state geometry along with
respective passivated clusters (d) Zn4O1H12**, (e) Zn1O4H12*, and (f) Zn2O2H4*H4**, respectively. Respective Fermi energy is
adjusted to 0 eV for each cluster.

States around and below −16 eV are O s-states, whereas
states
from −6 eV to Fermi energy (Ef)
are O p- and Zn d- and s-states for bare clusters. The least stable
Zn4O1 cluster has O s-states shifted towards
lower energy. The major contribution near Ef is from Zn s-states for Zn4O1 cluster while
it is from O p-states for Zn1O4 and Zn2O2 clusters. On passivation, Zn s-states and O p-states
demonstrate spin symmetry, and Zn d-states shift from the region −8
to −4 eV below Ef to higher energy,
that is, from −5 eV to Ef. At the
same time, degeneracy of the Zn d-states is reduced on passivation
for all of the clusters. This observation suggests that stability
of the clusters increases with shifting of Zn d-states toward higher
energy, resulting in enhanced p–d hybridization and lifting
the spin asymmetry for Zn s-states and O p-states. A similar trend
is reported for small stoichiometric ZnO clusters.39 The order of stability of these clusters on the basis of
BE/atom is Zn4O1 < Zn1O4 < Zn2O2 < Zn4O1H12** <
Zn2O2H4*H4** < Zn1O4H12*. Although the Zn d-states occur at higher
energy for Zn1O4 than Zn2O2, the stability as indicated by BE/atom is less because of the presence
of more dangling bonds. It may be noted that ABE-number indicates
the stability order which agrees with the interpretation of l-DOS.
Bare Zn1O4 and Zn4O1 clusters
possess finite magnetic moment because of asymmetry of occupied O
p-states which, in turn, also affects the O s-states.

Figure 6 shows the
l-DOS for the bare clusters (a) Zn13O4 and (b)
Zn4O13, both having wurtzite bulk-like geometry
and (c) Zn8O8 stoichiometric cluster in the
ground state geometry along with their passivated counterparts (d),
(e), and (f), respectively. Because the passivators are shared in
case of Zn13O4H25**, the observed l-DOS and the shift in
DOS are very different, for example, the deep s-states of O are at
−21 eV. The passivated Zn13O4H25** cluster possesses
a magnetic moment of 2.5 μB. This clearly shows inadequacy
of the present scheme to stabilize Zn-surfaced clusters; hence, large-sized
cluster geometries are not studied with such a passivation scheme.
The increasing order of stability of these clusters estimated by BE/atom
and ABE-number is Zn13O4 < Zn4O13 < Zn8O8 < Zn13O3H25** < Zn8O8H16*H16** < Zn4O13H36*. It can be clearly
observed that variation in the stability of the cluster with the distribution
of l-DOS is similar to small-sized clusters. The O s-states are deep
at around −17 eV and dangling bonds of the clusters are mostly
contributed by O s- and p-states for O-surfaced clusters while by
Zn d-states for Zn-surfaced clusters. These dangling bonds decrease
the stability of clusters. The stability of the clusters is found
to increase with shifting of Zn d-states to higher energy and O p-states
toward lower energy, causing an increase in p-d hybridization and
bringing in spin symmetry for O s- and p-states. It is clear from Figure 6b,e,c,f that passivation
increases the degeneracy of O s-states, removing their spin splitting
and decreases the degeneracy of Zn d-states and increases the stability
of clusters.

(d) Zn13O29H64* and (e) Zn19O20H18*H22** clusters; all
clusters are having wurtzite bulk-like geometry. The order of stability
of these clusters estimated by BE/atom is Zn29O13 < Zn13O29 < Zn19O20 < Zn19O20H18*H22** < Zn13O29H64*, but it is Zn29O13 < Zn19O20 < Zn13O29 < Zn19O20H18*H22** < Zn13O29H64* according to ABE-number. Bare nonstoichiometric
clusters possess more dangling bonds in comparison to stoichiometric
or nearly stoichiometric clusters. This fact affects the stability
of clusters and is another reason to discard BE/atom as a parameter
to discuss the stability of all kinds of clusters together. We would
again like to emphasize that the observations of increased p–d
hybridization from the l-DOS plots and stability of clusters according
to ABE-number as discussed earlier also hold for these clusters.

to 0 eV for each cluster.

Our earlier work on stoichiometric ZnO clusters including
Hubbard
parameter U (onsite Coulomb correction) has shown
that inclusion of U shifts the Zn d-states to lower
energies reducing the Zn d- and O p-states hybridization but on passivation
the Zn d-states shift to higher energies and Zn s-states move to lower
energies resulting in higher stability of clusters.39 We do not expect results of present work to change qualitatively
on inclusion of U.

For smaller nonstoichiometric
clusters, the number of atoms on
the surface, in comparison to those in the interior, is larger. The
ratio of number of one- and/or two-coordinated atoms to the total
number of atoms in a cluster decreases from 80% in smallest cluster
to ∼45% for the largest cluster reported in this work. On passivation,
the surface states are pushed down in energy and the HOMO–LUMO
gap opens up. More the number of surface states, larger is the gain
in energy on passivation. Further O atoms are more electronegative
and form stronger bonds with H* in comparison to the bonds formed
by Zn atoms with H**. This is evident from the comparison of BE values
of Zn-surfaced and corresponding O-surfaced clusters. Our earlier
work on stoichiometric clusters also supports this conclusion on the
basis of Bader charge analysis and transfer of charge from Zn to H**
and from H* to O. Therefore, we find that O-surfaced nonstoichiometric
clusters are more stable and therefore are more probable.

The
present sizes of clusters are less than the experimentally
reported sizes; however, we believe that with decrease in size the
increase of O concentration at the surface is highly likely, and our
studies could set the maximum limit to O-rich possible nonstoichiometry.
Although stability of such O-surfaced clusters increases with decrease
in size, Zn13O29H64* has decent size and hence is a more
probable candidate than smallest Zn1O4H12* cluster for experimental
realization. Enhancement in ROS at the surface of nanoparticles by
adopting nonstoichiometric nature and with decrease in size is possible.
This property can be ascribed to previously observed enhancement in
antimicrobial activity with decrease in size.7,8

Conclusions
Nearly stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric small clusters of ZnO
having bulk-like wurtzite geometry are studied using DFT-based electronic
structure calculations. Passivation by fictitious hydrogen atoms is
used to satisfy the dangling bonds as well as to mimic chemical environment
under the capping of ligands. It is found that fictitious hydrogen
atoms provide a bulk-like environment for O-surfaced clusters, and
IR does not change the bulk-like wurtzite geometry significantly.
A more suitable parameter, ABE-number, is introduced for heteroatomic
clusters like ZnO to discuss the stability. The superiority of ABE-number
over BE/atom is emphasized to compare relative stability in agreement
with electronic structure through l-DOS plots. The stability of bare
stoichiometric clusters is found to increase fastest with size, while
that of bulk-like bare nearly stoichiometric geometries is found to
be next in line. Among same sizes, the O-surfaced bare nonstoichiometric
clusters are observed to be more stable than Zn-surfaced clusters,
whereas bare stoichiometric clusters are found to be the most stable.
The nonstoichiometric clusters are found to be less stable than nearly
stoichiometric clusters.

Passivation is found to increase the
stability (BE/atom and ABE-number)
of clusters multifold as the dangling bonds get satisfied. The stability
of passivated clusters is observed to decrease with increase in size
and the variation is ascribed to decreased surface effects and relative
contribution of the passivators. Irrespective of the central atom
for nonstoichiometric clusters, O-surfaced and O-excess clusters are
found to be more stable. This stability is ascribed to stronger bonding
of O atoms with the passivators in comparison to bonding of Zn atoms.
Among the family of O-surfaced passivated clusters, the first two
(Zn1O4H12* and Zn13O29H64*) have shown higher
relative structural stability than neighboring clusters. The trend
of variation of stability with nonstoichiometry is analyzed for bare
and passivated clusters of ZnO by profiling BE/atom and ABE-number
as a function of ROF. The stability of various ZnO clusters is observed
to be dictated dominantly by the underlying p–d hybridization
of O and Zn states. Shifting of Zn d-states toward higher energy and
O p-states toward lower energy causes an increase in the stability
of the clusters because of larger p–d hybridization. The HOMO–LUMO
gap of ZnO clusters can be tuned up to 6.3 eV by choosing appropriate
surface terminating species and size. Inspired by the high relative
stability of the Zn13O29H64* cluster, we urge the experimental
community to detect and study such peculiar nonstoichiometric O-surfaced
wurtzite ZnO clusters for different applications. Our study reveals
that clusters with excess O and terminating O are more stable. Thus,
ligands that bind strongly with O should be used during chemical synthesis
for arresting the growth. Also, O-giving salts should be mixed in
a larger proportion than Zn-giving salts to result in excess O because
nonstoichiometric clusters are predicted to be more stable than stoichiometric
clusters on passivation. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate ligands
for passivation and knowing their bonding with Zn/O atoms, it may
be possible to preferentially form Zn-surfaced or O-surfaced clusters.

Computational
Methodology and Other Details
We have used DFT24,25-based Vienna Ab initio Simulation
Package (VASP).26−29 Accurate plane augmented wave method,30 as implemented in VASP, has been employed. Exchange–correlation
energy functional as given by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof has been
used within the generalized gradient approximation.31,32 A periodically repeating large, cluster-centered, cubic supercell
has been used (with at least a distance of 12 Å between neighboring
clusters so as to have negligible intercluster interaction) for self-consistent,
spin-polarized electronic structure calculations at single k-point, namely, the Γ point. Optimized plane wave
basis set with energy cut-off of 300 eV is used for all calculations.
Zn 3d states are explicitly treated as valence states. Conjugate gradient
algorithm is used to minimize the total energy of cluster by IR till
the electronic energy and ionic forces reach up to 10–4 eV and 10–3 eV/Å, respectively, for all calculations.
The Gaussian smearing scheme with broadening of 0.001 eV is used to
treat partial occupancies.

The standard reported passivators
for II–VI semiconductor
materials, fictitious hydrogen atoms with Z = 0.5
(H*) for anions, and Z = 1.5 (H**) for cations are
used.33 Passivation helps to mimic the
local surrounding as in bulk or under the influence of capping agents
for clusters. This method is well reported and widely used to avoid
computationally costly actual ligand capped calculations. Normally
all atoms are fourfold co-ordinated in wurtzite geometry, and hence,
the number of passivating fictitious hydrogen atoms to be attached
to an atom on the surface is decided accordingly. However, it is found
in some Zn-surfaced clusters that Zn–H** bond distances and
resulting bond angles cannot accommodate requisite number of H** atoms.
In such cases, less number of H** atoms are used. The resulting clusters
are found to be less stable with partial occupancies and nonzero and
nonintegral magnetic moments.

The stability of clusters is characterized
by comparing respective
binding energies (BE). BE of a given cluster is calculated using eq 1. Term Ecluster or EZnnOm refers to the energy of
a ZnnOm cluster
with n Zn atoms and m O atoms. EZn and EO are energies
of isolated Zn and O atoms, respectively. To compare the BE of unpassivated
and passivated structures on a similar footing, the contribution of
the passivator atoms has been removed and BE of passivated clusters
is defined in eq 2. 1   2  

It is to
be noted that the BE of a passivated cluster is higher
than respective bare cluster because of the absence of dangling bonds.
This results in higher stability of small passivated clusters than
bulk. The effect of passivation diminishes with the increase in size
and decrease in surface to bulk ratio. The concepts of BE per ZnO
or BE/atom are regularly used parameters to study relative stability
of stoichiometric clusters. The number of cationic and anionic atoms
is not same in nonstoichiometric clusters; hence, it is not possible
to calculate BE per formula unit. Also, because the atoms are of different
species and the stability of the cluster can be influenced by relative
contribution of different species, the concept of BE per atom is not
useful for size-dependent comparison. Therefore, the concept of BE/atom
or BE per ZnO cannot be used for nonstoichiometric clusters.

Experimentally BE density or BE per unit volume can be correlated
to the enthalpy of the system. Hence, average BE per unit volume can
be a suitable parameter to compare the stability, but it is not practical
because of difficulties in estimating the volume of a cluster. To
tackle this problem, a more systematic approach, the concept of bulk
normalized average BE/atomic number (ABE-number) has been introduced
as defined in eq 3, where Mcluster and Mbulk represent the sum of atomic numbers of atoms in a cluster and in
a unit cell of bulk, whereas BEcluster and BEbulk are the BE of the cluster and bulk unit cell, respectively. It is
basically a way to assign weightage to each constituent element in
a heteroatomic cluster with respect to the most stable configuration
of the respective bulk material. 3  

Thus, the ABE-number is assigned
to be 1 for bulk. Higher values
of ABE-number represent relatively higher stability for systems with
positive BE. It may be noted that in very few cases this may not hold,
for example in case of Ga, some clusters are found to be more stable
than the bulk.34 This weightage can also
be defined in terms of electronegativity of constituent elements at
oxidation state in the most stable state. In the present case, weightage
is given in terms of the atomic number of the element. ABE-numbers
of passivated clusters are found to be higher than bulk. However,
with the increase in size, the value decreases approaching 1. Ideally,
bulk systems are infinite in extent, and the passivators are not needed
in calculations. It seems that use of passivators to satisfy the dangling
bonds results in overbinding of small clusters, and this effect diminishes
with increase in size as the ratio of number of atoms on the surface
to that in the bulk decreases with increase in size.

To understand
the significance and validity of ABE-number, a comparative
test study is performed on small nonstoichiometric ZnnOm clusters, where n = 5 and 6 and m = n –
1, n + 1, n + 2, and n + 3, with well-known ground state of ZnnOn (n = 5 and 6) clusters
using respective ABE-number and BE/atom (details can be found in the Supporting Information).

The calculated
value of BE per ZnO or cohesive energy (7.57 eV)
for bulk ZnO in wurtzite form using primitive and 108 atom supercell
is in fair agreement with published experimental value of 7.52 eV.35 For bulk ZnO, the calculated BE/atom and ABE-number
are 3.79 eV and 1.9, respectively. For calibration purpose, vibrational
frequencies for bulk ZnO are calculated using standard primitive cell
of four atoms, and the calculated values 101, 254, 382, 416, 455,
and 569 cm–1 are in good agreement with previously
reported experimental values 100, 380, 410, 438, and 584 cm–1 at 7 K,36 as well as theoretical values
of frequencies 91, 261, 391, 409, 440, 552, and 560 cm–1. The optimized BE and bond length of ZnO dimer are found to be 2.34
eV and 1.70 Å, in excellent agreement with the reported values
of 2.12 eV and 1.73 Å, respectively.37,38 These results are cited for establishing the credibility of the
present calculations.
