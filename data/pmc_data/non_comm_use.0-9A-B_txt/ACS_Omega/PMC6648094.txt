Interaction
of a tripyridine ligand bearing a 2,6-di-tert-butylphenolic
fragment (L, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)pyridyl)phenol)
with CoII pivalate or chloride led to the formation of
one-dimensional coordination polymers [Co(L)Cl2]n·nEtOH (1) and [Co3(L)2(OH)(Piv)5]n (2) or a trinuclear complex Co3(H2O)4(L)2Cl6 (3) (Piv– = pivalate). Chemical oxidation
of L and 1–3 by PbO2 or
K3[Fe(CN)6], as well as exposure of L (in solution
or solid state) and 2 (in solid state) to UV irradiation,
led to the formation of free radicals with g = 2.0024,
which probably originated because of oxidation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenolic groups. These radicals were stable for several days
in solutions and more than 1 month in solid samples. Irradiation and
oxidation of the solid samples probably caused formation of the phenoxyl
radical only on their surface. It was shown by density functional
theory calculations that exchange coupling between the unpaired electron
of the phenoxyl radical and CoII ions was negligibly weak
and could not affect the electron paramagnetic resonance signal of
the radical, as well as exchange coupling of CoII ions
could not be transmitted by L. The latter conclusion was confirmed
by the analysis of magnetic properties of 1: temperature
dependency of magnetic susceptibility (χM) of 1 could be simulated by a simple model for isolated CoII ions.

1 Introduction
Coordination
polymers are considered as the basis for creation
of new sorbents, catalysts, and luminescent and magnetic materials.1−5 The specific feature of such systems is their capacity to combine
several physical properties, which can find application in practice,
such as nontrivial magnetism and luminescence,6−8 catalytic activity
along with the ability to adsorb certain substrates,9−11 and the ability to change the physical property upon interaction
with different compounds7,12,13 or action of external factors (irradiation, pressure, etc.).14−17 For creation of materials with tunable properties, metal–radical
complexes are promising objects because free radical generation or
disappearance can make significant influence on electric conductivity18,19 and can be an instrument for luminescence control.20−22 In addition, unique spin transitions were found in transition metal
complexes with free radicals, which resembled spin-crossover and were
caused by rearrangement of the crystal structure at certain temperature.23,24 Thus, studies of the structure and physical and chemical properties
of the transition metal compounds with stable free radicals are an
actual task of modern inorganic and physical chemistry, as well as
materials science.

Two principally different methods for creation
of metal–radical
coordination compounds can be distinguished: interaction of a metal
complex with a stable free radical18,23−25 and generation of the free radical in the coordination compound.18,26,27 Whereas the first approach has
been widely exploited for synthesis of metal complexes of stable free
radicals,23−25 the second one, radical generation in the coordination
compound, was used more rarely.26,27 The aim of the present
study was to determine the possibility of stable free radical formation
in CoII coordination compounds with a tripyridine ligand,
containing a fragment of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol,
namely, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)pyridyl)phenol
(L, Figure 1), and
to reveal the influence of such systems’ structure on the stability
of the free radical.

Figure 1 Ligand used in this study.

In this study, complexes [Co(L)Cl2]n·nEtOH (1), [Co3(L)2(OH)(Piv)5]n (2), and Co3(H2O)4(L)2Cl6 (3) were synthesized and
their X-ray structures were determined. Generation of radicals in
the free ligand and CoII complexes under UV irradiation
or upon chemical oxidation was studied, and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) was used to detect free radicals. To check if the
exchange coupling between the unpaired electron of the phenoxyl radical
and CoII ions could influence the EPR signal, density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. It was found that L could
not transmit efficiently any exchange interactions in this system.
To check this conclusion, temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility
of 1 was analyzed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Formation of the Complexes
Complexes 1 and 3 were synthesized by
interaction of L
with CoCl2 in ethanol. The conditions for crystallization
of these compounds differed by the reagent ratio: the coordination
polymer 1 crystallized when large excess of CoCl2 was used, whereas the discrete trinuclear complex 3 formed at approximately an equimolar ratio of the reagents (however,
the quantity of CoCl2 was not sufficient for quantitative
formation of 3). Formation of the different compounds
on interaction of L with CoCl2 could be associated with
their different solubility: the use of excess of cobalt ions could
favor increase of the product c(CoCl2)·c(L) (where c is concentration) to the
value, equal to the solubility product of 1, and then
precipitation of this compound from the equilibrium mixture occurred.
Notably, use of different quantities of CoCl2·6H2O led to addition of different quantities of water to the
reaction mixture, but this factor seems to be of minor importance
because water quantity, added with CoCl2, was at least
30 times lower than the water content in 96% ethanol, used as a solvent
for synthesis.

Interaction of CoII pivalate with
L in solvothermal conditions in acetonitrile led to the formation
of the coordination polymer 2, containing a hydroxo-bridged
trinuclear fragment. Hydroxide could be formed from water, present
in the solvent, upon interaction with the pivalate ion.

2.2 X-ray Structures of Ligand and Complexes
The structure
of L was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis (Figure 2). The L molecule does not have symmetry axes or planes. Three pyridine
rings lie approximately in one plane, whereas the mean plane of the
benzene ring is rotated with respect to the mean plane of pyridine
rings by 42.8°. Some features of the structure of free L in comparison
with those of the structure of L in coordination compounds 1–3 will be discussed below.

Figure 2 X-ray structure of L.
Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity of
presentation.

Crystal lattice of 1 is built from one-dimensional
(1D) polymeric chains [CoCl2(L)]n (Figure 3). Ethanol
molecules are located between such chains. The crystallographically
nonequivalent fragment of 1 has formula CoCl2(L)·C2H5OH. The positive charge of the
CoII ion is compensated by two coordinated chlorides. CoII ions are located in distorted tetrahedral donor sets, and
Co–N and Co–Cl bond lengths are typical for CoII complexes with tetrahedral coordination environments.28,29

Figure 3 X-ray
structure of the 1D chain of 1. Hydrogen atoms
are omitted for clarity of presentation.

The molecules of L bind CoII ions because of coordination
of N1 and N3 atoms of the “terminal” pyridine rings,
whereas the N2 atom of the central pyridine ring remains noncoordinated,
as it was previously found in the coordination polymers with similar
polypyridine ligands, bearing different substituents instead of the
2,6-di-tert-butylphenolic moiety.30−32

The mean
planes passing through the pyridine rings of L of the
neighboring chains are parallel (this is implied by the crystal lattice
symmetry), and the distance between these planes is 3.36–3.46
Å (different values for different pairs of planes, Figure S1, Supporting Information). Close location
of the pyridine rings of L from the adjacent [CoCl2(L)]n chains can be caused by π–π
stacking of their aromatic systems with the stacking distance equal
to the separation between the above-mentioned planes.

Compound 2 is a 1D coordination polymer, and the structure
of the polymeric chains can be represented as trinuclear Co3(OH)(Piv)6 fragments linked by two coordinated L molecules
(Figure 4). The trinuclear
Co3(OH)(Piv)6 unit has a symmetry plane, passing
through the Co2 ion and oxygen atom of the μ3-OH
group (Figure 5). Co1
and Co2 ions are linked by the bridging pivalale, whereas Co1 and
Co1′ are linked by the two bridging pivalates. The coordination
spheres of Co1 and Co1′ can be described as octahedra and contain
four oxygen atoms (which belong to the μ3-OH group
and pivalale) and two N atoms of terminal pyridine rings of L molecules
in cis-positions.

Figure 4 Structure of the 1D chain in 2. Hydrogen atoms are
omitted for clarity of presentation.

Figure 5 Structure of the Co3(OH)(Piv)5 fragment in 2 (additionally, N atoms of coordinated L molecules are shown).
Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity of presentation, except the
H atom of the μ3-OH group.

In contrast to that of Co1, the coordination sphere of Co2
can
be represented as a CoO4 tetrahedron, where O atoms belong
to the μ3-OH group and two bridging and one nonbridging
pivalate. The closest distances between CoII ions in 2 are 3.4660(8) Å (Co1···Co1′)
and 3.2979(9) Å (Co1···Co2). There are no signs
of π-stacking interactions between the neighboring 1D chains
in the crystal lattice of 2.

Compound 3 is a trinuclear centrosymmetric complex
of molecular structure, and Co1 is located in the inversion center
(Figure 6). The coordination
sphere of Co1 (the central CoII ion) can be represented
as a distorted CoN2O4 octahedron, where the
nitrogen atoms belong to the pyridine rings of two molecules of L
and O atoms belong to the water molecules. N atoms are located in trans-positions (as imposed by symmetry of the molecule).

Figure 6 X-ray
structure of 3. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for
clarity of presentation. Disorder of oxygen atoms of coordinated water
molecules is not shown.

The coordination spheres of Co2 and Co2′ ions (the
terminal
CoII ion) can be described as distorted CoNCl3 tetrahedra. The charge of the central CoII ion is formally
compensated by the charges of two terminal CoCl3– ions, and the whole molecule of 3 is neutral.

As in the case of 1, only terminal pyridine rings
of L participate in bonding with CoII ions, whereas the
N atom of the central pyridine ring is not coordinated. Co–O,
Co–N, and Co–Cl bond lengths are typical for CoII complexes with octahedral and tetrahedral coordination environments.12,29,33 As in the case of 1, ligand L is bridging and links Co1 and Co2 (or Co2′) ions.
The neighboring molecules of 3 are bound by hydrogen
bonds with participation of the coordinated H2O from one
molecule of 3 and Cl– anions from the
another one; however, no signs of π-stacking could be found
in this case.

In free L, 1, and 3,
the fragments of
the pyridine rings in each molecule of L are almost coplanar. In contrast,
the angle between the mean plane of the benzene ring of di-tert-butyl-phenol and the mean plane of pyridine rings (φ)
is 42.8° in free L, 40.4° in 1, and 33.4°
in 3 (the mean planes are built through all C atoms and
N atoms in the cycles). Among these three compounds, the pyridine
rings of L bound in 2 are not coplanar and the largest
angle between the mean planes of the terminal and “central”
pyridine rings in 2 is 40.3°. Such twisting of the
ligand can be the sign of significant structural tension of this molecule
in this case.

The structures of air-dry samples of 1–3 do not correspond exactly to the structures
of solvated
crystals, for which single-crystal diffraction experiments were performed,
as concluded from the analysis of powder XRD patterns (Figures S2–S4, Supporting Information).
The differences between the experimental and calculated powder XRD
patterns can be explained by partial solvent loss and partial disorder
of the crystal lattices, which are quite typical for the coordination
polymers and coordination compounds. The crystal lattice of 1D polymer 1 seems to be the most stable among the compounds 1–3.

2.3 Free Radical Formation
upon Oxidation of 1–3
Oxidation of 1–3 was carried out
in both solution and solid state, as described below, and free radicals
were detected by EPR. In all cases, an intense signal with g = 2.0024 was found, and this signal can be assigned to
the stable phenoxyl radical.34,35

Irradiation of
solution of L in CH2Cl2 by UV light caused occurrence
of the EPR signal with a hyperfine structure (Figure 7). Such splitting can result from the interaction
of the magnetic momentum of the unpaired electron with nuclear magnetic
momenta of two hydrogen atoms of the benzene ring of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (aH1 = 1.85
G), two hydrogen atoms of central pyridine ring (aH2 = 1.72 G), and the nitrogen atom of the central pyridine
ring (aN = 0.75 G).

Figure 7 EPR spectrum of the phenoxyl
radical generated by irradiation of
L in solution in CH2Cl2 (293 K, ν = 10.0854
GHz) and its simulation performed using EPR simulator software (for
simulation, line width was taken as 0.5 G and line shape was taken
as Lorentzian curve). http://www.eprsimulator.org/ (accessed on June 2018).

These values of hyperfine splitting constants are typical
for substituted
phenoxyl radicals.34,36 The values of aH1 and aH2, estimated from
the simulation, are close, and this finding may be an indication of
significant delocalization of the electronic density of the unpaired
electron on the benzene ring and the central pyridine ring of L. The
possibility of such delocalization agrees with the X-ray structural
data for L; the length of the C–C bond between the benzene
and central pyridine rings (C8–C16 bond, Figure 2) is 1.485(1) Å; this value is lower
than the one for the single C–C bond, and such bond shortening
can be caused by conjugation of these rings. Notably, the bonds C3–C6
and C10–C11 between the pyridine rings are also shorter than
single bonds (1.492(1) and 1.484(1) Å, respectively); however,
the EPR spectrum can be simulated without signal splitting on hydrogen
atoms of the terminal pyridine rings.

Treatment of L in solution
in CH2Cl2 or CH3CN with PbO2 or K3[Fe(CN)6] led to generation of strong
EPR signal (Figure 8), which can be assigned to the phenoxyl
radical.34,35 There are two absorption maxima in the electronic
spectrum of the solution, obtained after oxidation of L by PbO2 in CH3CN (λmax = 640 nm, εeff = 82 L/(mol cm) and λmax = 423 nm, εeff = 181 L/(mol cm); Figure 9). The change of the spectrum of L upon treatment with
PbO2 can be caused by the formation of the phenoxyl radical
in solution. At the same time, the values of effective extinction
coefficients, εeff, calculated assuming that oxidation
of L was complete, were significantly lower (by an order of magnitude)
compared with the values determined for solutions of many phenoxyl
radicals.35,37 Low εeff values calculated
for the solution of oxidized L could be the signs of its incomplete
transformation into the corresponding phenoxyl radical. Notably, the
electronic spectrum of oxidized L did not contain bands of 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-(tert-butyl)-4,4′-diphenoquinone, which could form
upon oxidation of p-substituted di-tert-butylphenols
with PbO2,38 and destruction
of L upon its oxidation with formation of such quinone could be excluded.

Figure 8 Typical
EPR spectrum of the phenoxyl radical generated by oxidation
of L in CH2Cl2 with PbO2 or K3[Fe(CN)6] (T = 293 K, ν
= 9.2936 GHz). The inset shows the same spectrum, but the scale is
presented as on Figure 7 for comparison.

Figure 9 Electronic spectra of
the solutions of L and the radical, which
formed upon oxidation of L by PbO2 in CH3CN.

The signal in the EPR spectrum
also occurred upon irradiation of
solid L by UV irradiation, grinding of solid L with PbO2 without any solvent, treatment of solutions of L in CH3CN or CH2Cl2 with solid PbO2, and
stirring of the two-phase system (solution of L in CH2Cl2 and aqueous K3[Fe(CN)6]). In all of
these cases, no hyperfine structure of the EPR signal could be observed.
In the case of oxidation of L by PbO2 in CH2Cl2 or K3[Fe(CN)6] in the two-phase
system, the intensity of the EPR signal grew for ca. 30 min (in the
presence of the oxidant) and further treatment with the oxidant did
not cause signal intensity change.

In the case of 1–3, the EPR signal
occurred after grinding of solid samples with PbO2 or treatment
of ground samples of these complexes with aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] (Figure 10). Notably, crystal lattices of these three compounds
disordered upon exposure to aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6], as it can be concluded from the powder XRD patterns (Figures S2–S4), but no signs of compound
dissolution were observed. The crystal lattice disorder was probably
caused by captured solvent exchange into water in the crystal lattices.
Among compounds 1–3, disorder of
the crystal lattice was the most significant in the case of 3, the crystal lattices of 1D coordination polymers 1 and 2 appeared to be more resistant to disorder
compared to the crystal lattice of 3, built from discrete
molecules.

Figure 10 EPR spectra of the samples obtained by oxidation of 1 by aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6]
(T = 293 K, ν = 9.2936 GHz).

At the same time, irradiation of the solid samples
of 1–3 by UV light led to the occurrence
of a very
weak EPR signal only in the case of 2 (Figure 11). The reasons for such difference
among 1, 3, and 2 are ambiguous.
One of the possible explanations can involve absorption of UV light
by the compounds, which prevents UV light from passing inside the
crystals. To check this supposition, the UV adsorption spectrum of
L in solution can be considered. Indeed, there are two strong adsorption
bands at λmax = 272 nm (ε = 3.6 × 104 L/(mol cm)) and at λmax = 232 nm (ε
= 4.2 × 104 L/(mol cm)) in this spectrum (Figure S5). In diffuse reflectance spectra of
CoII coordination compounds, absorption bands in the UV
region are observed as two peaks with λmax at 287
and 240 nm in the case of 1 and as wide bands at ca.
260–265 nm in the cases of 2 and 3 (Figure S6). These values are close to
λmax of the UV source (256 nm); thus, UV light absorption
on the surface of crystals can decrease the efficiency of radical
generation.

Figure 11 EPR spectrum of the sample obtained by irradiation of
solid 2 with UV light (T = 293 K, ν
= 9.6456
GHz).

The lifetime of the phenoxyl radical
in solutions of L in CH3CN or CH2Cl2 in air was not less than
4 days, whereas radicals generated in solid samples of 1–3 by treatment with aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] (after washing with water and drying
in air) could be detected in EPR spectra for at least 1 month after
oxidation, even in the case when the samples were stored in contact
with air. The higher stability of the radical formed in the solid
samples compared to that in solutions was probably associated with
a lower rate of any possible reactions of such radical in the solid
state.

For estimation of the radical content in the solid sample,
obtained
upon treatment of 1 with aqueous K3[Fe(CN)6], the diffuse reflectance electronic spectra of 1 and the sample, obtained after its oxidation and washing with water,
were measured (Figures 12 and S6). The spectra of the complexes
were quite similar; for example, there were several bands in the electronic
spectrum of 1, and the most intense were located (λmax) at 608 and 1005 nm. These bands could be assigned to d–d
transitions in the CoII ion: 4A2(F)
→ 4A2(T1, P) and 4A2(F) → 4E(T1, P).39 The bands of CoII ions in distorted
octahedral donor sets, expected for 2 and 3, were probably obscured by more intense39 bands of CoII in distorted tetrahedral environments.
No new bands were found in the diffuse reflectance spectra of samples
obtained after treatment of 1–3 with
K3[Fe(CN)6] solution; in particular, there was
no band with λmax = 423 nm; this band was found in
solution of L after oxidation and it should not overlap with other
bands in the spectrum of 1. Thus, it can be concluded
that treatment of 1–3 with K3[Fe(CN)6] solution led to oxidation of insignificant
quantity of L, which could be detected by EPR but could not be detected
by less sensitive optical spectroscopy.

spectra of 1 and the sample obtained
after treatment of 1 with aqueous K3[Fe(CN)6], followed by washing with water.

2.4 Analysis of Possible CoII–CoII and CoII–Radical Interactions
In this study, the conclusion about radical formation was made on
the basis of EPR spectral data. However, exchange interactions between
stable radicals and paramagnetic ions of 3d metals can have influence
on the EPR signal, and in the case of strong antiferromagnetic coupling,
such EPR signal can be even not detectable.24,40−42 To analyze if there could be any influence of such
coupling on the EPR spectra, additional experimental and theoretical
studies were carried out.

The ability of L to transmit exchange
interactions between the paramagnetic centers (radical and CoII or CoII and CoII) was evaluated by
DFT calculations performed for the fragments of 1. In
lieu of the sample containing fully oxidized L, experimental verification
of DFT results could not be carried out for radical–CoII coupling, whereas studies of the magnetic properties of 1 allowed us to check the conclusion regarding the energy
of CoII–CoII exchange.

The minimal
distance between the CoII ions in the coordination
polymer 1 is 6.151(1) Å (the distance between the
ions from two different neighboring 1D chains). In addition, the exchange
interactions between these ions potentially can be transmitted through
π–π stacking of pyridine rings, which are directly
bound to such ions (the distance between such rings is about 3.5 Å,
vide infra). The closest separation between CoII ions in
one 1D chain is 12.555(2) Å. Similarly, the shortest distances
between the O atom of the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenolic
fragment and the CoII ion are equal to 12.916(4) Å
(through ligand L) and 5.157(4) Å (through space, Figure S7). Such distances are sufficiently short
for exchange coupling.43

For evaluation
of possible exchange interactions between the unpaired
electron on the O atom of the phenolic fragment and paramagnetic CoII ions, DFT calculations were performed using two species,
which model coupling through ligand L and through space (these fragments
are shown in Figure S7, and the details
of calculations are provided in the Experimental
Section). It was found that the J value for
radical–CoII coupling was slightly positive in the
first case, which corresponds to weak ferromagnetic interactions (J = 0.423 cm–1, in Hamiltonian notation, Ĥ = −2JSR·SCo; see the Experimental Section for details) and slightly negative in the second case, which corresponds
to antiferromagnetic interactions (J = −0.464
cm–1). At room temperature, such interactions would
not have noticeable influence on the system of spin levels and, hence,
on the ERP signal.

For evaluation of possible CoII–CoII exchange interactions, two species were considered
in DFT calculations;
these species represent the fragments of crystal lattice of 1: (1) py-CoCl2-l-CoCl2-py
(py = pyridine), where transfer of exchange coupling can occur via
bridging L and (2) {py-CoCl2-L}2, where exchange
interactions can be transferred through π-stacking of pyridine
rings (Figure S7). It was found that in
both cases exchange interactions were negligibly small. This conclusion
was checked by the magnetic measurements.

Molar magnetic susceptibility
(χM) of 1 was measured in a temperature
range from 2 to 300 K. The χMT value
for 1 at 300 K was 2.62
cm3 K/mol, which exceeded the spin-only value for the ion
with S = 3/2 (1.875 cm3 K/mol). Upon temperature
lowering, the χMT value gradually
decreased to 2.56 cm3 K/mol at T = 33
K and then rapidly fell down to 1.71 cm3 K/mol at 2 K (Figure 13).

Figure 13 χMT vs T dependency
for 1 (points) and the calculated curve, corresponding
to parameters from the text.

The χMT vs T dependency was simulated using a model based on Hamiltonian (1), which takes into account only zero-field splitting
(ZFS) of CoII spin levels and does not consider exchange
interactions.43,44 1  where DCo is the
ZFS parameter. The data were simulated by full-matrix diagonalization
using Mjöllnir softwareb.45,46 The procedure of magnetic data simulation did not provide calculation
of standard deviation of the parameters; instead, the deviation of
this parameter (in the last digit), which leads to ca. 10% increase
of R2, is shown in brackets after the
parameter value (R2 = ∑(χMTcalc. – χMTexp.)2/∑(χMTexp.)2). The best
correspondence of the experimental data and the calculated curve was
achieved at DCo = 10.0(2) cm–1, g(Coxy) = 2.46(1), g(Coz) = 2.0 (fixed), and tip
= 0.00034(1) cm3/mol (R2 =
4.9 × 10–5). The success of the experimental
data simulation by the proposed model could be an evidence that exchange
interactions between CoII ions in 1 were negligibly
small, which agrees with the results of DFT calculations.

Notably,
the room-temperature magnetic susceptibility values of
solid samples of 1 before and after oxidation by aqueous
K3[Fe(CN)6] were equal (χM =
8.7 × 10–3 cm3/mol); this measurement
can be considered as the additional evidence for low content of the
radical.

Thus, according to the results of DFT calculations
and experimental
studies of magnetic properties of 1, it can be concluded
that L does not transfer exchange interactions efficiently and all
atoms or ions bearing unpaired electrons can be considered as isolated
paramagnetic centers in this case.

3 Conclusions
Interaction of CoII salts with the polypyridine ligand,
containing the fragment of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol,
led to the formation of 1D coordination polymers 1 and 2 and a trinuclear discrete complex 3 depending
on the counterion nature and synthetic conditions. It was shown that
incorporation of the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenolic fragment
in the bridging ligand was a suitable way for creation of coordination
compounds and coordination polymers, able to be oxidized with formation
of stable radical, that can be detected by EPR. CoII ions
and unpaired electrons of the radical in 1 could be considered
as isolated paramagnetic centers, and the ligand L did not transmit
exchange interactions, which can have influence on the EPR spectra.
Stability of such a radical was higher in the case of complexes compared
to that in an oxidized ligand in the solution. Oxidation of solid
samples probably led to radical formation on the surface of crystals.

The results of this study can be used in development of materials
that change their physical properties upon external influence and
have potential for use as active bodies of sensors, as smart magnetic
and optical materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Commercially available
reagents (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) were used without additional purification.
Cobalt(II) pivalate ([Co(Piv)2]n) was prepared as previously described.47 Ethanol used in the study contained 4% water.

4.2 Synthesis of 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-(3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)pyridyl)phenol
(L)
This compound was prepared using a modification of the
known method of condensation of acetylpyridines and aromatic aldehydes.48 4-Acetylpyridine (10 g, 82.5 mmol) was added
to the suspension of crushed NaOH (3.3 g, 82.5 mmol) in poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG-400; 110 cm3) at 0 °C, and the mixture
was stirred for 10 min. Then, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(9.7 g, 41.2 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the suspension
was left for 2 h at 0 °C; every 30 min, it was manually stirred
by a spatula. After 2 h, ammonium acetate was added (20 g, excess),
and then, the suspension was heated at 110 °C with stirring for
10 h. During this time, the color of the reaction mixture changed
from cherry red to pale red, and then, a pink precipitate of crude
L formed. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature,
water (250 mL) was added to the precipitate, and the precipitate was
filtered and washed with water (100 mL) and cold propanol-2 (20 mL).
Finally, L was purified by recrystallization from propanol-2. Yield

4.6 Generation of Free Radicals
and Sample Preparation
for Measurements
All operations were performed in Ar, unless
otherwise stated in the article. Two methods were used for free radical
generation: UV irradiation and chemical oxidation. For UV irradiation,
a Philips TUV-6 gas lamp was used (λmax = 256 nm,
full absorption of UV at λmax < 185 nm). The solutions
were irradiated in a quartz tube. For measurement of EPR spectra,
the samples, ground in an agate mortar, were irradiated directly in
a quartz EPR tube, and such method allowed us to minimize oxidation
by ozone, which could form from air under UV radiation.

For
radical generation from L in solution by chemical oxidation, PbO2 and K3[Fe(CN)6] were used as oxidants.
In the first case, PbO2 (2 mg) was suspended in a solution
of L (3 mg) in methylene chloride (2 mL) or acetonitrile (2 mL); after
2 min, the suspension was filtered directly in a cell of spectrophotometer
or EPR tube for measurement of electronic and EPR spectra of the radical
in solutions, respectively. In the second case, 1 mL of 0.016 M solution
of L in methylene chloride was stirred with 2 mL of 0.06 M solution
of K3[Fe(CN)6] in water for 5 min and then stirring
was stopped and the organic phase was transferred to the EPR tube.

Oxidation of the di-tert-butyl-phenolic fragment
in solid coordination compounds 1–3 was performed by treatment of 50 mg of ground complex with 5 mL
of 0.1 M solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] in water, containing
1% (v/v) of ethanol for better solution affinity to hydrophobic solid,
for 30 min. Samples were filtered and washed with water (2 ×
5 mL) and cold acetonitrile (1 mL). In some experiments, samples of
L and complexes were ground directly with PbO2.

4.7 Methods
C,H,N-Analysis was performed
using a Carlo Erba 1106 instrument. 1H NMR spectra were
measured using a Bruker Advance 500 spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction
experiments were performed on a Bruker X9 instrument with Cu radiation
(λ = 1.54056 Å). Magnetic susceptibility (χ) was
measured using a Quantum Design PPMS-9 magnetometer in 5 kOe field.
Samples were measured in Teflon capsules, and diamagnetic corrections
were calculated using Pascal’s constants.35 Room-temperature measurements of magnetic susceptibility
of solid samples of 1 before and after oxidation by aqueous
K3[Fe(CN)6] were carried out using a Johnson
Matthey magnetic balance. In this case, χ of the sample was
measured and then this sample was treated with aqueous K3[Fe(CN)6], washed with water, and dried, and χ was
measured again. EPR spectra were measured using CENTRO SPECTR DS100-X
(77 K) and Bruker Elexsys II (293 K) instruments. Electronic adsorption
spectra were measured using a Carl Zeiss Specord 210 spectrophotometer,
and diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a Specord M40
spectrophotometer. All solutions after compound oxidation with PbO2 were filtered through a membrane from porous glass to remove
any suspended particles.

Single-crystal X-ray structure determination
for L and complexes 1–3 was performed
at the User Facilities Centers of IGIC RAS. The single crystals were
taken directly from the reaction mixtures (for complexes) or obtained
upon recrystallization from propanol-2 (for L). The X-ray data sets
were collected on a Bruker APEX II diffractometer equipped with a
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a graphite-monochromated Mo
Kα radiation source (λ = 0.71073 Å).49 Semiempirical absorption correction was applied for L, 1, and 3.50 The structures
were solved by direct methods and by Fourier techniques and were refined
by the full-matrix least-squares method against F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydrogen
atoms. The hydrogen atoms of the carbon-containing ligand in the compounds
were positioned geometrically and refined using the riding model.
All calculations were carried out with the use of the SHELX-97 and
SHELXL-2013 software packages.51 The crystallographic
parameters and the refinement statistics are presented in Table 1.

Solvent molecules in the crystal
lattice of 3 could
not be localized, and corresponding electronic density was corrected
using the SQUEEZE procedure from PLATON software.52 In 3, each oxygen atom coordinated to CoII is disordered in two positions with occupation factor 0.5.

DFT calculations were performed using the broken symmetry (BS)
method53,54 with exchange–correlation potentials
Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseria (TPSS)55 and B3LYP.56 The
calculations were carried out using ORCA software.57 Basis sets def2-SVP58 and def2-TZVP59 were used for description of electronic orbitals
(double- and triple-split-valence basis with polarization functions,
respectively). Calculations were performed using fragments of polymeric
chains of 1, built using atomic coordinates, determined
by X-ray diffraction analysis, followed by optimization of the positions
of hydrogen atoms by force field UFF60 in
Avogadro software61 (force field based
on Open Babel library62). In the first
step of exchange interaction parameter calculation, the solution of
the self-consistent field was found for particles in a high-spin state
(HS) (multiplicity 4) at given coordinates. Then, the broken symmetry
(BS) electronic state was built on the basis of the HS state by change
of a sign of unpaired electrons’ spin projections for one of
the CoII ions (“BrokenSym 3,3” instruction
of ORCA software) or for a radical (“BrokenSym 3,1”
instruction), and self-consistent field solution was found for this
state. The exchange interaction parameter (for spin-Hamiltonian Ĥ = −2JŜi·Ŝj) was found using energies
calculated for two states as J = −(EHS + EBS)/(Si + Sj)2.53,54 The iteration convergence threshold in terms
of the difference between full energies of the system between the
neighboring cycles of iterative solution was set as 10–9 au (VeryTightSCF instruction of ORCA).
