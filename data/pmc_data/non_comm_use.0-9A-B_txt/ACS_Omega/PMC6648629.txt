The layered double
hydroxides (LDHs) of Ca2+ and trivalent
cations, Al3+ and Fe3+, are single-source precursors
to generate supported CaO, which picks up CO2 from the
gas phase in the temperature range 350–550 °C. The supports
are ternary oxides, mayenite, and Ca2Fe2O5. The uptake capacity of the Fe3+-containing LDH
at 1.9 mmol g–1 is two times the capacity of the
Al3+-containing LDH. The product of CO2 uptake
is calcite CaCO3. It is observed that the intercalated
chloride ions reduce the thermal penalty by inducing the early decomposition
of CaCO3. In the case of the chloride-intercalated LDHs
of Ca2+ and Fe3+, the CaCO3 formed
is completely decomposed at 900 °C. This is in contrast with
the CaCO3 formed from bare CaO, which shows no sign of
decomposition at 900 °C under similar conditions. This work shows
that the hydrocalumite-like LDHs are candidate materials for CO2 mineralization.

1 Introduction
The
accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere
is responsible for the rise in the temperature of the earth’s
atmosphere. There are major efforts underway to mineralize CO2 and store it as a benign solid carbonate, an approach known
as carbon capture and storage.1,2 An alternative is to
use the mineralized form as a feedstock for pure CO2 for
other chemical processes.3,4 In the latter approach,
the temperature difference between CO2 uptake and its eventual
regeneration constitutes the thermal penalty.5,6 For
purposes of energy efficiency, materials with low thermal penalty
are preferred.

A number of materials have been used as candidates
for CO2 capture and are reviewed elsewhere.7 Among
them, sintered layered double hydroxides (LDHs) comprise a prominent
family of materials. LDHs decompose to yield mixed metal oxides (MMOs).8 Metal oxides in general exhibit surface acidity
and are not expected to mineralize CO2, as the latter is
also acidic in nature. Nevertheless, a modest CO2 uptake
capacity of 0.3 mmol g–1 has been reported for the
MMOs of Mg2+ and Al3+ obtained by the thermal
decomposition of hydrotalcite-like LDHs.9 This capacity is attributed to the adsorption of CO2 within
the morphological pores of the MMO. The same MMO is also reported
to exhibit a CO2 uptake capacity of 0.53 mmol g–1.10 Modifications in the morphology of
the crystallites and amorphization led to only modest gains in the
CO2 uptake capacity.11,12 LDHs infused with up
to 30% by weight of K2CO3 were found to show CO2 uptake capacity
of ∼1 mmol g–1 of LDH after calcination.13

From chemical, structural, and compositional
criteria, pristine
LDHs offer themselves as superior candidate materials for CO2 capture when compared to the sintered LDHs for the following reasons.(i) The LDHs
comprise positively charged
metal hydroxide layers having the general formula [M(II)1–xM′(III)x(OH)2]x+ (x = 0.2–0.33),
wherein, M(II) is commonly Mg2+ and M′(III) is commonly
Al3+, Cr3+, and Fe3+. Anions are
intercalated in the interlayer region. The LDHs are structurally and
functionally the “inverse” of the cationic clays. While
the cationic clays exhibit surface acidity, the LDHs are endowed with
surface basicity.14 The interaction of
pristine LDHs with CO2 has the character of an acid–base
reaction whereby the LDHs are expected to have a high affinity for
CO2.

(ii) Structurally,
the LDHs have interlayer
galleries which provide space for storage. The LDHs are also known
to swell and function as receptacles for increasing numbers of intercalated
species by means of a hydrogen-bonded network.15



Despite these advantages,
the pristine hydrotalcite-like [Mg–Al]
LDH did not gain any mass when exposed to CO2 (pressure
1 atm) over the temperature range 30–400 °C,16 although the [Mg–Al] LDHs sorb carbonate
anions from solution in quantities proportional to their layer charge.

Another important candidate LDH for CO2 mineralization
is the hydrocalumite-like LDH, in which M(II) is the Ca2+ ion and M′(III) is Al3+ or Fe3+.17 Although the conversion of Ca(OH)2/CaO to CaCO3 is widely studied in the context of deep
well disposal of CO2 under high pressure and its subsequent
mineralization to CaCO3,18 there
is relatively less work on the sorption and uptake of CO2 by the [Ca–M′] (M′ = Al3+ and Fe3+) LDHs. The [Ca–M′] LDHs are of interest for
many reasons in both the pristine and sintered forms.(1) Given its high natural
abundance,
Ca2+ is ubiquitous in soil and offers economic advantages
over Mg2+.

(2) Ca(OH)2 is more basic than
Mg(OH)2 and is expected to take up CO2 quantitatively
in a facile manner to yield CaCO3 (expected uptake 13.5
mmol g–1).

(3) The LDH of Ca and Al crystallizes
in a cation-ordered structure (space group R3̅),
in which the Ca2+ ion has a seventh coordination with a
water molecule in the interlayer.17 In
the hydrocalumite structure, the Ca2+ ion is displaced
away from the central plane of Al3+ ions. This displacement
facilitates coordination with a water molecule in the interlayer.
The puckered nature of the metal hydroxide layer helps to trap the
intercalated ion. For instance, when the [Ca–Al–Cl]
LDH is dehydrated, the Cl– ion moves to the seventh
coordination of Ca2+ and is efficiently grafted to the
layer. A similar phenomenon in the presence of CO32– could help immobilize CO2 more effectively
than otherwise. Thereby, the [Ca–Al] LDH offers a different
structure model for the mineralization of CO2 and its confinement
in the interlayer gallery.

(4) The decomposition temperature of Ca-containing
LDHs is in the range of 300–400 °C. The flue gas temperature
is very close to the decomposition temperature of Ca-containing LDHs
facilitating the reaction between the LDH and CO2.

(5) LDHs decompose with a
mass loss of
30–40%. The large mass loss results in the formation of a highly
porous MMO residue which is not only compositionally metastable19 but also has a large reactive surface area.20 These conditions are ideally suited for the
reconstruction of the LDH with the uptake of CO2 and water
vapor from the flue gas. This makes Ca-containing LDHs interesting
in CO2 sorption studies.



As
a first step to examining the suitability of the [Ca–M′(III)]
LDHs as sorbents for CO2, this work reports the uptake
of CO2 by a cohort of [Ca–M′–X] LDHs
(M′ = Al3+ and Fe3+; X = Cl– and NO3–).

2 Results
A majority of the naturally occurring as well as laboratory-synthesized
LDHs have CO32– ions intercalated in
the interlayer region. CO32–-intercalated
[Ca–M′] LDHs are less known owing to the fact that the
single cation CaCO3 forms in preference to the LDH during
coprecipitation.21 The [Ca–M′]
LDHs are generally obtained with intercalated Cl– ions.22 The most common of these having
the formula Ca2Al(OH)6Cl·2H2O is called Friedel’s salt.17 The
as-prepared [Ca–M′–Cl] (M′ = Al and Fe)
LDHs are highly crystalline, and the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) exhibit sharp 00l (l = 3n) reflections in the low-angle region (5–25°
2θ) typical of layered materials followed by hkl reflections which obey the reflection conditions −h + k + l = 3n (Table S1) in the high-angle regions
(2θ > 25°), indicative of rhombohedral symmetry. The
refined
cell parameters are in agreement with earlier reports on these LDHs.17,22 The [Ca–Al–NO3] LDH crystallizes in the
hexagonal symmetry (Figure S2, Table S2). Given the large difference in the
ionic radii of Ca2+ (114 pm) and the trivalent cations
(Al3+ 67.5 pm and Fe3+ 78.5 pm), the [Ca–M′]
LDHs crystallize in cation-ordered structures. The a-parameter (a ≈ 5.74 Å) is a measure
of the M′···M′ distance within the metal
hydroxide layer and is typical of the composition x = 0.33 ([Ca2+]/[M′] = 2).

The approximate
formulae of the LDHs (Table 1) were arrived at by a combination of different
independent estimations. As an illustration, the methodology is described
in detail for [Ca–Al–Cl]. The metal contents determined
independently by a combination of AAS and gravimetry correspond to
the nominal composition [Ca2M′(OH)2]+. The Cl– content estimated independently
by ion chromatography was found to be substoichiometric. The shortfall
of negative charge required to neutralize the positive charge on the
metal hydroxide layer was made up by the inclusion of hydroxyl ions
in the interlayer to yield the LDH composition [Ca2Al(OH)6]Cl0.6(OH)0.4. Such an assumption is
reasonable as the precipitation is carried out at high pH (11.5–12).
There is evidence to suggest that LDHs comprising univalent anions
are rarely single anion materials and generally contain more than
one anion.23,24 The intercalated water content
was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

The TGA of the
as-prepared [Ca–Al–Cl] LDH (Figure 1a) carried out in
flowing N2 matches with similar data published by other
authors.17 The mass loss occurs in three
well-defined sigmoidal steps, the inflection temperatures being 146
°C (step I), 343 °C (step II), and 682 °C (step III)
(Table 2). Assuming
step I to correspond to dehydration yields a water content corresponding
to 2.3 water molecules per formula unit. The total mass loss (observed
41.1%; expected 41.4%) corresponds to the complete decomposition reaction  

Figure 1 TGA
and DTG curves of [Ca–Al–Cl] LDH in (a) flowing
N2 and (b) flowing CO2.

The mass loss associated with step II corresponds to dehydration
and dehydroxylation (observed 16.2%; expected 20.6%). The third mass
loss (step III) corresponds to anion expulsion (observed 10.2%; expected
6%). The difference in expected and observed values at the end of
the steps II and III arises because of overlapping of steps but the
expected and observed total mass loss are in very good agreement.
The step-wise decomposition is  

A similar approach was used to arrive at the approximate formulae
of the other LDHs (Table 1). It is noteworthy that in the cooling cycle, the mass of
the residue is unchanged, showing that the decomposition is irreversible.

The TGA measurement was repeated in flowing CO2 to examine
the interaction of the LDH with CO2 in the gas phase (Figure 1b, Table 3). The following observations
were made:(i) During the heating cycle, the LDH
loses 28% of its mass up to 394 °C in two sigmoidal steps with
inflection at 132 °C (step I) and 380 °C (step II). These
two steps are comparable to those obtained in the control under flowing
N2. However, following these two steps, unlike in the control
experiment, a plateau is established from 394 to 460 °C (plateau-I).

(ii) At the end of plateau-I,
the LDH
gains ∼4.5% mass (∼1 mmol g–1) in
the temperature range 460–555 °C. Thereafter, the mass
is nearly constant with a downward bias up to 750 °C (plateau-II).
It is important to note that the mass gain in flowing CO2 begins after the dehydroxylation step. A prolonged stay at the plateau
temperature (T = 550 °C) in a separate experiment
did not lead to further mass gain (Figure S3).

(iii) A mass loss of
∼4.6% is observed
at 788 °C.

(iv) On
staying at 900 °C for up
to 30 min, 37.7% total mass loss is observed. This is less than the
loss expected (41.8%) for the complete decomposition of the LDH. On
cooling, the residue instantaneously regains some of the mass earlier
lost at T > 800 °C and reaches a constant
value
at 700 °C (plateau-III). However, plateau-III is nearly 5.5%
mass lower than plateau-II and ∼1% mass lower than plateau-I
showing considerable hysteresis.

In separate experiments, the LDH
was decomposed at the temperatures
corresponding to the three plateaus and characterized by PXRD. The
phase obtained at plateau-I (460 °C) has a reflection at ∼29.4°
2θ characteristic of 104 reflection of calcite CaCO3. The poor signal-to-noise ratio and background are indicative of
a significant volume fraction of X-ray amorphous content. The absence
of the intense basal reflections shows that the layered structure
has collapsed. On cooling back to the ambient, this phase does not
regain mass, showing that dehydroxylation is not reversible. However,
on further heating in flowing CO2 to the temperature of
plateau-II (640 °C), CaCO3 formation is evident from
the PXRD pattern. The IR spectrum of the residue at plateau-II shows
an enhancement of the absorption at 1409 cm–1 because
of calcite formation (see Figure S4 and
the accompanying discussion of the IR spectra). At plateau-III, a
mixture of CaCO3 and the ternary oxide mineral mayenite,
Ca12Al14O33, is observed (Figure 2). The thermodynamically
stable ternary oxide is obtained at 900 °C and does not react
with CO2. Only a part of the CaO formed in excess over
the ternary oxide at 900 °C gains CO2 on cooling to
the temperature of plateau-III accounting for the hysteresis in the
TGA.

Figure 2 PXRD patterns of the residues obtained from the decomposition of
[Ca–Al–Cl] LDH at plateaus (a) P-I, (b) P-II, and (c)
P-III. Reflections marked with asterisks are due to calcite CaCO3. Unmarked reflections are due to mayenite.

Similar observations are made in the case of the
[Ca–Fe–Cl]
LDH (Figure 3). The
total mass loss (observed 35.8%; expected 36.5%) in flowing N2 corresponds to the decomposition reaction  

Figure 3 TGA
and DTG curves of [Ca–Fe–Cl] LDH in (a) flowing
N2 and (b) flowing CO2.

This mass loss is realized over three steps at 161 °C
(14.4%),
278 °C (12.1%), and 672 °C (9.4%). In flowing CO2, a behavior similar to that seen in [Ca–Al–Cl] is
observed. At the end of the second step of the mass loss (26.1%, 400
°C, plateau-I), the dehydroxylated residue is X-ray amorphous
(Figure 4). This residue
does not gain mass on cooling, but on heating in CO2, a
mass gain corresponding to 8.5% of the original LDH is observed at
plateau-II (680 °C) to yield CaCO3. The absence of
any CaCO3 at plateau-I is responsible for the higher uptake
when compared to the [Ca–Al] LDH. This mass gain corresponds
to the uptake of 1.93 mmol g–1 of the original LDH.
Above 700 °C, there is a steep mass loss (18.3%) until 900 °C
because of the decomposition of the CaCO3 formed at plateau-II.
The total mass loss corresponds to a mixed oxide residue. On cooling,
this oxide residue regains mass in two minor steps (850 and 650 °C)
to yield plateau-III at which the residue corresponds to a mixture
of CaCO3 and Ca2Fe2O5.
Evidently, the ternary oxide phase formed at 900 °C does not
pick up CO2 on cooling, resulting in a much greater hysteresis
between plateaus-I and III than that in the case of the [Ca–Al]
LDH.

[Ca–Fe–Cl] LDH at (a) P-I, (b) P-II, and (c) P-III.
Reflections marked with asterisk correspond to CaCO3. Unmarked
reflections correspond to Ca2Fe2O5.

As the Cl– ion
is nonvolatile at moderate temperatures
(T < 500 °C), similar experiments were performed
on the NO3–-intercalated LDH to see if
the nitrate-LDH shows a higher CO2 uptake than the chloride-LDH.
Under flowing N2, the [Ca–Al–NO3] LDH undergoes complete decomposition (Figure S5, observed mass loss 47.3%; expected 44.8%). Under flowing
CO2, an uptake of 4.6% (∼1 mmol g–1 original LDH) is observed (Figure 5) at plateau-II (500 °C). In this case, the decomposition
is incomplete at 900 °C (observed mass loss 30%) and correspondingly,
there is no mass gain in the cooling cycle. The residue obtained at
900 °C was dissolved in dilute HCl and analyzed by ion chromatography.
Residual NO3– ion was observed to the
extent of 0.07 mol % (4.5 wt %) with respect to LDH and 0.10 mol %
(6.3 wt %) with respect to residue, showing that the decomposition
of the LDH is incomplete under flowing CO2 and the nitrate
is retained in the residue. The nitrate-containing phase could not
be identified. The phase obtained isothermally at plateau-I was a
mixture of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 (Figure S6). The phase obtained at plateau-II was CaCO3. At plateau-III, a mix of CaCO3, mayenite, and
another ternary oxide Ca5(Al3O7)2 was observed.

in flowing CO2.

3 Discussion
The LDH crystallizes in a rhombohedral
structure. CaO crystallizes
in the cubic rock salt structure. There is a well-established topotactic
relationship between the precursor and product phases, which can be
described as [00l]H/R∥[111]C (l = 1 for H: hexagonal; l = 3 for R: rhombohedral; C: cubic).25 The decomposition of the LDH takes place by the condensation of
the metal hydroxide layers brought about by dehydration and dehydroxylation.
This occurs just below 400 °C. CaO is therefore expected to form
throughout the bulk of the LDH. The uptake of CO2 takes
place thereafter at T > 460 °C. The uptake
of
CO2 is an addition reaction of the type CaO + CO2 → CaCO3. However, all of the Ca are not utilized
in the first cycle. If indeed all of the free CaO were to be utilized,
plateau-II would correspond to 86% of the mass of the [Ca–Fe]
LDH (91% in the case of [Ca–Al] LDH). The observed mass gain
at plateau-II corresponds to ∼26% Ca utilization (∼11%
in the case of the [Ca–Al] LDH). CaCO3 formation
evidently takes place on the exposed surface of the CaO crystallites.
Because continued stay (up to 2 h) at various temperatures spanned
by plateau-II did not lead to further mass gain (Figure S3), it is our conclusion that CaO utilization is not
limited by the kinetics of CO2 uptake, but by the uptake
of CO2 at the surface of the CaO crystallites. The CaCO3 formed on the surface prevents a more complete material utilization.

The residue obtained at plateau-II was calcined in flowing nitrogen
at 900 °C and reheated in flowing CO2. The oxide residue
gained nearly 30% mass by aggressive uptake of CO2 in the
temperature range of 434–685 °C (Figure S7). We conclude that intermediate calcination at high temperature
exposes fresh CaO surface, facilitating increased material utilization.
This is in direct contrast to silica removal by hydrotalcite-like
LDHs.26,27 Silicates being nonvolatile ions accumulate
in the solid phase on repeated cycling, leading to decreased efficiency.
Carbonates are volatile ions and behave differently.

Pure CaO
is used for high-temperature CO2 cycling. However,
there are two major drawbacks of CaO: (i) the thermal penalty is high.28,29 The CO2 uptake temperature is close to 650 °C for
CaO and 450 °C for Ca(OH)2, whereas no decomposition
of the formed CaCO3 is observed up to 900 °C (Figure 6) in both cases.
(ii) The CO2 uptake falls sharply by 80% during thermal
cycling;30 the fall is attributed to high-temperature
sintering of the CaO crystallites.30,31

Figure 6 TGA and DTG
curves of CaO in flowing CO2.

There have been major technological and scientific efforts
to alleviate
these problems by (i) appropriate engineering to utilize the heat
generated by the exothermicity of the carbonation cycle and reduce
the thermal penalty32,33 and (ii) by dispersing CaO on
an inert oxide support such as mineral mayenite to prevent agglomeration
and sintering of the active CaO crystallites.34,35

The use of hydrocalumite-based Ca-rich LDH as a precursor
has the
potential to generate in single step, active CaO, as well as mayenite
(Ca2Fe2O5 in the [Ca–Fe] LDH)
for effective CO2 uptake. Further, the use of the intercalated
Cl– ion induces the decomposition of the formed
CaCO3 at 900 °C in the case of [Ca–Al–Cl]
LDH. In contrast with this, the CaCO3 formed by the uptake
of CO2 by pure CaO (Figure 6) shows no signs of decomposition at 900 °C. In
the case of [Ca–Fe–Cl] LDH, the formed CaCO3 decomposes at 800 °C itself bringing about a 100 °C reduction
in the thermal penalty compared to the [Ca–Al–Cl] LDH.
The combined/synergistic effect of Fe and Cl makes the [Ca–Fe–Cl]
LDH interesting for practical use. In all cases isothermal treatment
of the LDH at temperatures of the three plateaus did not enhance the
mass gain, showing that the mass gain in the TGA is not limited by
kinetics.

4 Conclusions
Hydrocalumite-like LDHs
are superior to the hydrotalcite-like compounds
for applications related to mineralization of CO2. These
Ca-containing phases are single-source precursors for both CaO and
the ternary oxide supports. Among the hydrocalumites, the [Ca–Fe–Cl]
phase shows the highest uptake of CO2. The product of CO2 uptake is the calcite form of CaCO3. The presence
of intercalated chloride ions appears to reduce the thermal penalty
when compared to CaO, whereas intercalated nitrate ions fail to induce
the decomposition of the CaCO3 formed as a result of CO2 uptake.

5 Experimental Section
The [Ca–M–X] LDHs (M = Al and Fe; X = Cl– and NO3–) were synthesized by coprecipitation.
In separate experiments, the [Ca–Al–Cl] and [Ca–Fe–Cl]
LDHs were prepared by dropwise addition of a mixed metal chloride
solution in the stoichiometric ratio ([Ca]/[M] = 2, dropping rate
0.3 mL min–1) to a NaCl solution (100 mL; 0.4 mol
L–1) containing five times excess Cl– ions. The pH of 11.5 was maintained for all of the syntheses by
dispensing NaOH solution (0.5 mol L–1) at 60 °C
using a Metrohm model 836 Titrando, operating in the pH STAT mode.
N2 gas was bubbled during precipitation and ageing to avoid
carbonate contamination. Once the precipitation was complete, the
samples were aged in mother liquor under a N2 blanket for
18 h under vigorous stirring.

In the case of [Ca–Al–NO3] LDH, rapid
coprecipitation was carried out by mixing the mixed metal nitrate
solution and NaOH (50 mL, 2 mol L–1) in single step
in a screw cap bottle. NaNO3 (15 times in excess) was added
to the NaOH solution prior to mixing. The pH of the final mixture
was >12. The coprecipitated slurries were aged in mother liquor
(48
h, T 85 °C).

All of the precipitates were
centrifuged, washed with boiled type
II water (specific resistance 15 MΩ cm, Millipore Academic water
purification system), and dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C.

5.1 Wet Chemical Analysis
The compositions
of the LDH were determined by a combination of techniques. The Ca
and Fe contents were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy
using a Shimadzu model AA-6650 atomic absorption spectrometer. The
Al content was estimated gravimetrically by dissolving a preweighed
amount of the LDH in a mineral acid and precipitating Al3+ in an ammoniacal buffer. The resulting gelatinous precipitate was
calcined (T ≈ 900 °C) and weighed as
Al2O3. The anion contents were determined by
dissolving an accurately weighed amount of the LDH in a suitable mineral
acid. The anions released were estimated by ion chromatography (Metrohm
model 861 advanced compact ion chromatograph with Metrosep SUP5 150
column).

5.2 Characterization
All samples were
characterized by PXRD using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer
(source Cu Kα radiation, Ni filter, λ = 1.5418 Å)
operating in reflection geometry. The PXRD patterns of the LDHs were
indexed by using APPLEMAN program, part of the code PROSZKI suite
of programs. The PXRD patterns of the oxide residues were indexed
by “finger printing” by comparing the observed 2θ
values with those reported in the powder diffraction files. TGAs were
carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e system
(25–900 °C, heating rate 5 °C min–1) driven by STARe 7.01 software. The analyses were carried
out in flowing N2 (control) and flowing CO2 (test)
to measure the mass gain if any, as a result of CO2 uptake.
In separate experiments, the LDHs were heated in the TGA balance at
different temperatures determined by the appearance of plateaus in
the TGA profile. The phases obtained were analyzed by PXRD. TGA measurements
were also carried out on CaO and Ca(OH)2 used as controls.
IR spectra were recorded by using a Bruker model Alpha-P IR spectrometer
