Utilizing customized
deep-ultraviolet laser ionization mass spectroscopy,
here we report a finding of remarkable dehydrogenation product of N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine
(DMT). The DMT dehydrogenates find comparable mass abundance with
the DMT molecule ions showing decent stability at the loss of one
electron and one H atom from the DMT molecule. First-principles calculation
reveals that the dehydrogenation most readily occurs at the N-connected
methyl group. Furthermore, at the removal of a hydrogen atom, a neighboring
hydrogen atom on the other methyl come close and interact with the
dehydrogenated methylene group, pertaining to C–H···C
weak interactions which give rises to a resonant structure (C···H–C)
on a basis of hydrogen atom quantum tunneling effect. The quantum
tunneling tautomer of DMT dehydrogenates displays reversible donor–acceptor
charge-transfer interactions as demonstrated by natural bonding orbital
analysis and vibrational spectroscopy. It is worth noting that the
novel dehydrogenation product was also observed for another small
organic molecule o-phenylenediamine, which bears
two neighboring amino groups and the subsequent dehydrogenation product
pertains to resonant structures of N–H···N and
N···H–N. The deep ultraviolet laser not only
produces fragmentation-free mass spectra for such small organic molecules
but also tailors the interesting quantum tunneling tautomer from such
specific molecules.

Introduction
Dehydrogenation, as
the name implies, is a chemical reaction involving
the removal of atomic or molecular hydrogen.1−7 The dehydrogenation from C–H activation is recognized of
significance enabling to convert inert and low-valued molecules such
as alkanes to reactive and valuable products such as olefins.8,9 However, such processes are often endothermic and thus need high
temperature conditions and/or well-designed catalysts.10,11 This is because the C–H bond (1.09 Å, 413 kJ/mol) is
a covalent bond, that is, carbon shares its outer valence electrons
with hydrogens, leading to both-filled outer shells hence reasonable
stability; also, the electronegativity difference between C (2.55)
and H (2.2) atoms is 0.35 according to Pauling’s scale, small
enough to be regarded as being nonpolar.12−14 Therefore,
the C–H bond is relatively very strong and generally unreactive,
allowing only participation in radical substitution or utilizing well-designed
catalysts. For example, catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
was found a representative process to produce styrene which is the
monomer for synthetic polymers;15−18 oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons also received
reasonable research interest by using various oxides as efficient
catalysts.19−25

Although the C–H bond is strong, its bond strength
could
vary over 30% in magnitude even for fairly stable organic compounds,
even in the absence of heteroatoms, allowing selectivity of C–H
bond activation.26 The use of light to
control selective chemical reactions is highly attractive and has
been recognized of importance from early on. Recently, astronomers
reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of life, hydrocarbon
molecules (CH, or methylidyne radical) and positive ion (CH+) and carbon ion (C+), are largely resulted from interactions
of ultraviolet light radiation from stars, rather than other ways
as thought earlier, like turbulent events related to supernovae and
young stars.27 It is worth noting that
photochemical synthesis has also attracted significant attention owing
to a global drive toward renewable, clean, and sustainable energy
technologies.28,29

N,N-Dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMT, C9NH13) known as a component
in dental materials is widely used in medical devices with annual production estimates of
1 to 10 million pounds (U.S. Environmental Protection Program 2011).30 Also, it was used in the preparation of acrylic
bone cements 50 years ago,31−33 but in recent years it was recognized
a lack of information regarding its toxicity and carcinogenicity available
in the literature.30 In view of this, precise
and efficient identification of such chemicals and their photo-induced
fragments is of significance. Utilizing customized all-solid-state
deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser, recently we developed a reflection time-of
flight mass spectrometer (Re-TOF-MS),34 which bears advantages for precise low-fragment mass spectrometric
analysis. On the basis of this instrument, here we report an interesting
finding of remarkable dehydrogenation product of DMT. The ionization
potential of this molecule is right at the single-photon energy of
the DUV laser pertaining to the high-efficient single-photon ionization
(SPI) process. The DMT dehydrogenates find comparable mass abundance
with the DMT molecule ions, showing decent stability of both and dehydrogenation-dominated
photo-induced dissociation of the DMT molecules. Along with first-principles
calculations, we rationalize the stability of dehydrogenation at the
N-connected methyl group, where a neighboring hydrogen atom on the
other methyl could come close and form H-bond weak interactions with
the dehydrogenated methylene group, pertaining to C–H···C
and C···H–C resonant structures, hence giving
rises to quantum tunneling tautomer.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1A presents
six mass spectra of DMT ionized by the 177.3 nm DUV laser, sampled
by a bubbling source combined with a pulsed valve and He buffer gas.
DMT is light yellow liquid in normal pressure at room temperature,
and it has an ionization potential of 6.93 ± 0.02 eV.35 Considering that the single-photon energy of
the DUV laser is 7 eV, it is inferred that the DUV-LIMS of DMT aims
at high-efficient SPI free of fragmentation. However, there are two
brother peaks dominating the mass spectra at the varied laser power
intensity, one refers to its molecule ion (C9NH13+•) and the other pertains to a dehydrogenation
product (C9NH12+). This is in sharp
contrast to the other samples, which also bear ionization potentials
close to 7 eV, such as para-phenylenediamine (PPD)
and benzophenone (BP), where solely dominant molecule ion peaks are
addressed in Figure 1B(a,d). Very clean mass spectra are observed, showing unique advantages
of the SPI mass spectrometry for chemical identification. Nevertheless,
there is a similar case: ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD)
also takes on remarkable dehydrogenation product (C6N2H7+) at the DUV-LIMS measurement (Figure 1B(c)).

Refer to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80% of the full energy at about 10
μJ. (B) Comparison of the DUV-LIMS of PPD (a), DMT (b), OPD
(c), and BP (d) at ∼5 μJ energy power, respectively.

To unravel the unusual dehydrogenation
fragment (C9NH12+) ionized by DUV
laser, simply we have checked
the structures of the four molecules. As is shown in the insets of Figure 1B, DMT have two neighboring
−CH3 groups and OPD also have two nearby −NH2 groups. In comparison, the other two molecules PPD and BP
do not have such groups close to each other. It is worth noting the
distinct difference of DUV-LIMS spectra of the two isomers, PPD and
OPD, which only bear different position of the two amino groups. Does
the positions of −CH3 and −NH2 groups account for selective dehydrogenation products for these
small organic molecules?

To verify this, we have first checked
the strengths of all the
C–H bonds in DMT after ionization and found that the C–H
bonds in −CH3 groups are very close to that of the
C–H on the skeleton carbon ring. However, when we scan the
potential energies for these C–H bonds dissociation (or, equivalently,
H elimination) for the ionic DMT by first-principles calculations,
as shown in Figure 2, we find that the dehydrogenation with H atom elimination from the
methyl group on N atom (red line, i.e., no. 2 H atom) displays the
least activation energy (4.15 eV), which is 1.1 eV less than that
for the removal of no. 5 H atom. The photo-induced ionization and
C–H bond dissociation processes can be summarized as 1   2

H atom removal off DMT calculated at the b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) level
of theory. Inset is the structure of DMT, where the atoms in blue,
dark, and gray refer to N, C, and H, respectively.

Furthermore, dynamics calculation for the most
stable dehydrogenization
product found that the dehydrogenization of DMT from a −CH3 group gives rise to resonating structures (tunneling tautomer),
as shown in Figure 3, pertaining to intramolecular H atom tunneling effect through a
3.11 eV energy barrier of a transition state with a H-location right
at the center of the other two NH2 groups. The tunneling
tautomer under the DUV laser excitation creates a dynamic condition
profiting to the stability of dehydrogenization product. This is well
consistent with the previous finding on malonaldehyde, which is known
as a typical system for the study of intramolecular H atom transfer.36,37 Also, the intramolecular quantum tunneling effect of DMT dehydrogenization
product is applicable to OPD dehydrogenization product.

the b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) level of theory. Insets are the electrostatic
potentials on the surface of cationic tautomer and transition state
of dehydrogenation products. Red and blue colors indicate negative
and positive regions, respectively, with the maxima and minima corresponding
to 0.11 and 0.19 a.u. The atoms in blue, dark, and gray refer to N,
C, and H, respectively.

Furthermore, to reveal the role of interactions between transferred
H atom and its adjacent atoms in determining the photo-induced quantum
tunneling effect of DMT, utilizing natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis
we have depicted the donor–acceptor overlaps of the cationic
tunneling tautomer and the transition state for the dehydrogenation
products, as shown in Figure 4. Simply considering charge-transfer interactions between
BDC–H and BDN–C* first, the first-principles calculations
show that the dominant interactions of two tautomers are donor–acceptor
overlaps between the bonding orbitals on the C–H bond (BDC–H) and the antibonding orbitals on the N–C
bond (BDN–C*), read as BDC–H → BDN–C* (3.71
kcal/mol, Figure 4a,d),
which is weaker than in the transition state (7.61 kcal/mol, Figure 4c). Also, the transition
state displays large donor–acceptor charge-transfer interactions
around the dominant BDC–H → BDC–N* (67.26
kcal/mol, Figure 4b).
Besides, the transferred H atom find the same charge-transfer interactions
with C–H bonds in the methyl group, BDC–H → BDC–H* (18.31, 4.89, 3.88 kcal/mol, Figure 4e–g). The large charge-transfer interactions
provide noncovalent interactions between the H atom and adjacent C
atom on methyl group allowing the formation of the quantum tunneling
tautomer, with decent stability and thus comparable mass abundance
with the parent ion peak.

acceptor orbitals are plotted in purple/yellow and blue/green, respectively.
The atoms in blue, dark, and gray refer to N, C, and H, respectively.

Conclusions
We report a finding
of remarkable dehydrogenation product of DMT
utilizing customized deep-ultraviolet laser ionization mass spectroscopy
(DUV-LIMS). The DMT dehydrogenates find comparable mass abundance
with the molecule ions because of the structure stability and the
hydrogen prefer to be dissociated at the −CH3 groups.
At the removal of a hydrogen atom, a neighboring hydrogen atom on
the other methyl come closer and interact with the dehydrogenated
methylene group, giving rises to resonant structures pertaining to
C–H···C weak interactions and hydrogen atom
quantum tunneling effect. The quantum tunneling tautomer of DMT dehydrogenates
displays reversible donor–acceptor charge-transfer interactions
as demonstrated by NBO analysis. In addition to the dehydrogenation
at the N-connected methyl group, we also found that this principle
is applicable to OPD, where the neighboring −NH2 groups facilitate the subsequent dehydrogenation product pertaining
to N–H···N interactions and resonant structures.
Thanks to the deep ultraviolet laser which not only produces fragmentation-free
mass spectra for such small organic molecules but also tailors the
interesting quantum tunneling tautomer from such specific molecules.

Experimental
and Computational Methods
Experimental Methods
The experiments
were performed
on a customized Re-TOF-MS34 (Figure S1, Supporting Information) based on the all-solid-state
DUV laser system (177.3 nm wavelength, 15.5 ps pulse duration, ∼15
μJ pulse energy, 10 Hz repeating rate) by frequency-doubling
of 355 nm laser through a KBBF–CaF2 prism-coupled
device.38 The powder samples of BP (99+
% purity, Acros), PPD, and OPD (99+ % purity, Acros Organics) were
put in a customized thermal evaporation source and heated to a certain
proper temperature that could produce continuous vapor to form a stable
molecular beam. DMT (99% purity, Alfa Aesar) is a liquid at room temperature,
and hence, a bubbling source is used along with a pulsed valve and
He buffer gas as a representative sampling method to attain supersonic
expansion molecular beam.

Calculation Methods
All the optimization,
frequency,
and energy calculations were performed on a basis of density functional
theory (DFT) embedded within the Gaussian 09 program package.39 Geometries of all species were fully optimized
at the unrestricted b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) level of theory.40,41 All the energies were corrected with zero-point-vibrations. All
transition states structures were checked and confirmed by intrinsic
reaction coordinate42 calculations. To
estimate the amount of charge of quantum tunneling tautomer of DMT
dehydrogenates, NBO43 analysis of neutral
phenylenediamine isomers was also performed. The NBO orbitals were
plotted via VMD and Multiwfn software.44
