This study reports usage of Mongolian anthracite-based porous activated carbons
(PMACs), namely, PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 for model diesel fuel desulfurization, having 500
ppmw of dibenzothiophene (DBT) in n-heptane. Further, the effects of
contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption capacity were studied
systematically. The experimental adsorption isotherm results were well represented by
the Sips isotherm for PMAC 1/3 and the dual site Langmuir isotherm for PMAC 1/4. The
maximum DBT adsorption by PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 were 99.7 and 95.7%, respectively. The
kinetics for the adsorption of DBT on PMACs follows the pseudo second order behavior.
The Weber–Morris plot shows the multilinearity over the entire time range,
suggesting that both the surface and pore diffusions control the adsorption. The values
of boundary layer thickness for PMAC 1/4 and PMAC 1/3 were found to be 3.183 and 1.643,
respectively. Thus, PMAC 1/4 possesses more surface diffusion control than PMAC 1/3. The
changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), entropy
(ΔS°), and enthalpy (ΔH°) are
negative, which confirms that the studied process is spontaneous and exothermic and
possesses less randomness at the interface. Based on the Sips isotherm, single-stage
batch-adsorber design was prepared for the adsorption of DBT onto PMAC 1/3.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The refractory sulfur compounds present in crude oil are becoming costlier for refiners
worldwide. The increase of sulfur content in the crude oil and the strict norms on sulfur
emission from diesel vehicles have made the desulfurization issue more
serious.1−4 The diesel sulfur content should be less than 10 ppm by 2020 as per the
latest regulations in India. The major challenges for refineries in India are to meet the
fuel sulfur specifications as well as reduce the aromatic content.5,6

Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a well-established process for desulfurization of liquid
fuels.7 However, it involves severe operating conditions and sensitive
as well as most advanced catalysts to produce diesel with sulfur content less than 10 ppm,
making the process expensive.7,8 There are limitations for the HDS process to remove benzothiophene,
dibenzothiophene (DBT), and alkyl substituent DBT.9 Therefore, the other
available desulfurization options involving oxidation, extraction, biochemical, and
adsorption methods have been considered to produce ultralow-sulfur diesel to meet the new
environmental regulations.7−16 Among these methods,
adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) has gained more attention because the adsorption technique
is simple to operate and can be done even under ambient conditions. Various research groups
have studied liquid-based ADS using different adsorbents.16−22 The main challenge for the ADS process is to
synthesize high adsorptive capacity adsorbents. In addition, adsorbents employed must
possess thioselectivity for the heavy refractory sulfur compound adsorption that needs
severe conditions to remove using the HDS process. In the past, several activated carbons
(ACs) produced from coal and biomass were used.16,23−25

ACs are the most celebrated adsorbents for their application in separation and purification
technologies because of their worthwhile surface properties.26,27 ACs have also become very popular for
ADS because of their microstructure.23,28,29 The adsorption performance of ACs depends upon
the adsorbent surface properties. In general, pore volume, specific surface area, pore size,
and pore size distribution of an adsorbent play an important role in
ADS.26,30,31 However, the surface properties do not always have linear relation with
the desulfurization capabilities45 and therefore, to further enhance the
adsorptive capabilities of adsorbents, researchers have impregnated ACs with metal
halides.26,28,32 In addition, it has been stated that the ADS performance of AC greatly
depends on the precursor materials used and preparation methods.33

The carbon-rich, high bulk density Mongolian raw anthracite (MRA) with less ash content can
be possibly used for producing adsorbents for ADS, as ACs from MRA have been already
successfully tested for methane adsorption and capacitor applications.34,35

In the present study, novel Mongolian anthracite-based porous ACs (PMACs) were tested for
sulfur removal from of the model diesel fuel (MDF) (DBT dissolved in
n-heptane). It may be noted here that ADS using PMACs has not been reported
yet according to the best of our knowledge. The adsorption results of DBT on PMAC 1/3 as
well as PMAC 1/4 are presented in this report. The Sips, Langmuir, and dual site Langmuir
isotherm models were used to study the equilibrium adsorption behavior of DBT on PMACs. The
adsorption kinetics of DBT on PMACs was studied using the pseudo first order, pseudo second
order, and diffusion models. Further, the thermodynamics of the adsorption system was
investigated to determine the values of ΔH°,
ΔG°, and ΔS°. At last, a batch
adsorption process design has also been proposed based on the results obtained.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
The method of preparation for the adsorbents PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 used in this study is
given elsewhere.35 The surface properties of the prepared PMACs are as
follows: specific surface area (PMAC 1/3: 2038 m2/g and PMAC 1/4: 2784
m2/g), average pore volume (PMAC 1/3: 1.31 cm3/g and PMAC 1/4:
2.27 cm3/g), and average pore diameter (PMAC 1/3: 2.00 nm and PMAC 1/4: 2.20
nm).35 The adsorbents were dried in a hot air oven at 110 °C for
12 h before every adsorption study. Beside these ACs, the chemicals used in this study,
namely, DBT of purity >98% and n-heptane of purity >99% were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Pvt ltd., India.

2.2 Model Diesel Fuel
For the preparation of the MDF, 0.1982 g of DBT was added into 100 mL of
n-heptane as purchased without any further purification. The
concentration of DBT is selected such that the total sulfur concentration should be 500
ppm by weight.

For investigating the selectivity of DBT over aromatic compounds, equimolar concentration
of two polyaromatic hydrocarbons, namely, naphthalene and fluorene and one monoaromatic
hydrocarbon, namely, ethylbenzene with different weight percentages (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt
%) were added into the MDF. The aromatic added MDFs were named MDF-A-α where α
varies from 2 to 10 wt %. Because n-heptane has volatile nature;
therefore, to avoid a change in the sulfur concentration, the prepared MDF was stored in
amber vials.

2.3 Adsorption Equilibrium
The adsorption of DBT on PMACs was done at 30 °C and 250 rpm. In a typical
experiment, 20 mL of MDF was taken in an Erlenmeyer flask with a known amount of the
adsorbent (0.025–0.40 g). The mixture of MDF and the adsorbent was agitated in an
Incubator shaker for 1 h. The DBT concentration in the desulfurized samples was analyzed
by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (PerkinElmer Claurs 580,
GC-FID) after separating the adsorbent using a whatman paper. GC is equipped with a
Elite-1 (length 50 m and inner diameter 200 μm) flame ionization detector as
well.

The quantity adsorbed qe (mg-S/g-A) was given by the eq 1 as
below 1  where qe is the quantity of
sulfur adsorbed (mg-S/g-A), C0 is the initial concentration of
sulfur (mg-S/L-MDF), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of
sulfur after the removal of sulfur by adsorption (mg-S/L-MDF). V and
W are the volume of MDF (L) and W is mass (g) of the
adsorbent, respectively. The percentage of sulfur removed was calculated using the
following
equation 2  

2.4 Data Analysis
To check the fitness accuracy of models, data analysis was done using the coefficient of
determination (R2), nonlinear error functions, residual root
mean square error (RMSE), and chi-square test (χ2). The empirical
equations used for this study are as
follows 3   4   5  where qe and
qm is the experimental and predicted value of the amount of
sulfur adsorbed, respectively, and n is the number of observations. The data analysis was
done based on the linear and nonlinear coefficient values. The
R2 value closer to unity and lower values of RMSE and
χ2 generally show that the predicted and experimental values fitted
well. The average relative error (ARE) and normalized standard deviation (NSD) were
employed to check the fitness of kinetic models. Generally, lower values of NSD and ARE
indicate better model fitting. The equations for the calculation of NSD and ARE are given
as
follows 6   7  where qt,e is the
experimental and qt,m is the theoretically calculated quantity
of sulfur adsorbed on PMACs.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of the Adsorbent Dosage
The removal capacity of sulfur was studied for different doses of adsorbents using MDF
containing 500 ppm of total sulfur content. The dosage was taken in the range of
0.025–0.4 g of adsorbent for 20 mL of MDF as shown in Figure 1. Sulfur removal was rigorously increased with increasing adsorbent
weight from 0.025 to 0.25 g. Thereafter the removal efficiency has become constant for the
adsorbent dose greater than 0.25 g for PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4. The relative successive
S-removal is small compared to removal with the initial adsorbent dosage. This shows that
the equilibrium has been reached between the adsorbate and adsorbent under the operating
conditions.36 It shows the solid concentration effect or particles
overcrowding.37

Figure 1 Effect of Adsorbent weight on sulfur removal at 303.15 K.

3.2 Equilibrium Isothermal Adsorption
The adsorption isothermal analysis was conducted using the MDF with a fixed initial
sulfur concentration of 500 ppm and the adsorbent dosage varies from 2.5 to 40 g/l for 1 h
at 30 °C. Figure 2 shows the relationship of
the equilibrium amount of DBT adsorbed on the surface of PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 against
equilibrium DBT concentration. As shown in Figure 2, qe increases with Ce
and reaches saturation which is the maximum adsorption capacity for PMAC 1/3
(∼2.489 kmol/kg) and PMAC 1/4 to (∼2.183 kmol/kg).

Figure 2 Adsorption isotherms of DBT on (a) PMAC 1/3 and (b) PMAC 1/4 at 303.15 K.

The observation of heterogeneity and homogeneity of the solid surface, calculation of
adsorption energy, interaction between the fluid compound and solid phase adsorbent and
the type of coverage were observed by the plot between Ce
(kmol/m3) versus qe (kmol/kg). The increased
adsorption is because of more surface area and adsorption sites with an increasing
adsorbent quantity from 0.025 to 0.4 g.38 The maximum DBT adsorption by
PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 were 99.7 and 95.7%, respectively, as shown in Figure 1, for 0.4 g of the adsorbent in 60 min. The sample PMAC
1/3 showed relatively higher adsorptive capacity though PMAC 1/3 having a smaller surface
area as compared to PMAC 1/4. The probable reason of higher removal using PMAC 1/3 could
be its higher micropore volume fraction (66.4%) available as compared to PMAC 1/4 (42.2%).
The DBT molecule size (0.8 nm)39 is more closer to the pore diameter of
PMAC 1/3 (2.0 nm)35 than PMAC 1/4 (2.2 nm) which allows PMAC 1/3 to
preferentially adsorb more DBT molecules.37,40,41Table 1 shows the ADS capabilities of various
adsorbents. It can be observed that the adsorptive capacity of PMACs synthesized in this
work have potential to adsorb the DBT molecule significantly.

3.3 Aspen Adsorption Isotherm Modelling
The DBT and n-heptane properties were evaluated by the Peng–Rob
equation of state (PR-EOS) thermodynamic model. PR-EOS42 is given as
under 8  where a and b are
binary interaction parameters and depend on the critical properties as mentioned
below 9   10   11  

3.3.1 Langmuir
In its formulation, Langmuir presumes monolayer adsorption that can only takes place at
a finite number of definite localized, identical, and equivalent sites. These sites have
no steric hindrance.43,44 The Langmuir isotherm is given by the following
equation 12  where qe and
qm are sulfur adsorbed at equilibrium (mol-S/kg-A) and the
maximum sulfur adsorbed at saturation (mol/kg). Ce is the
equilibrium concentration of sulfur adsorbed (mol-S/L-M) and
Ka is energy of adsorption.

3.3.2 Dual Site Langmuir
The dual site Langmuir model is used to describe the adsorption behavior on the
heterogeneous adsorbent. The heterogeneous adsorbent is formed by two homogeneous sites
with different energetic patches. If free energy of adsorbate–adsorbent on the
patch is the same, the amount of adsorbed n is given as45 13  where n1s and n2s are the saturation capacities on site 1 and 2,
respectively. b1 and b2
represent the affinity parameter of site 1 and 2, respectively, and C
is the solute concentration. The assumptions for the Langmuir model are applicable at
each patche. In addition, each site has different saturation capacities and the patches
do not interact with each other.46

The free energy for two different sites is given
as 14  where subscript i is the free-energy
level of site 1 or 2, the pre-exponential factor of the component on site
i is given by bi0 and
Ei is the adsorption energy of the
component on site i. The higher and lower adsorbate–adsorbent
free energy is donated by, i = 1 and i = 2,
respectively. For single gas adsorption, the free energy of site 1 is always greater
than site 2.

3.3.3 Sips
Sips represents the limiting behavior of the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms.29 The Sips nonlinear equation model is described
as 15  where ns is the
heterogeneity factor. If the value of ns is greater than 1
then it is heterogeneous.3 The Sips characteristics parameter is
b and is in (l/kmol)1/ns.

All the isotherms were employed to analyze the adsorption equilibrium behavior of DBT
on PMACs using Aspen Adsorption 8.4. The equilibrium adsorption data of DBT on PMAC 1/3
and PMAC 1/4 at 30 °C are shown in Figure 2. The goodness of fit of isotherm models with the experimental data was
checked using the calculated values of χ2 and RMSE,28 which are given in Table 2. The data
obtained from error analysis confirmed the best fit of Sips for PMAC 1/3 and dual site
Langmuir for PMAC 1, respectively.

3.4 Effect of Contact Time
The adsorbent size, the coefficient of diffusion, and the degree of mixing decides the
quantity and rate at which the adsorbate adsorbs on the surface of the adsorbent.47 MDF with DBT concentration 500 ppm were kept in contact with PMAC 1/3 and
PMAC 1/4 for 2 g/l adsorbent amount at room temperature for 10–90 min. After 60 min
a steady state was achieved and a quasi-equilibrium situation was obtained for both the
adsorbents as shown in Figure 3. The adsorption
rate rapidly increased in the earlier stage of experiments because of free sites available
for adsorbates to adsorb on the surface. The initial fast adsorption depicts that the
number of active sites available are more, and it slows down at equilibrium because of the
few available sites and the mutual repulsive forces between the adsorbate present in the
solution and at the surface of the adsorbent.48

Figure 3 Effect of time on Sulfur removal at 303.15 K.

3.5 Adsorption Kinetic Studies
The kinetic study is vital for designing an adsorption system. In the initial stage of
adsorption meso- and macro-pores gets saturated with DBT molecules. Thereafter, the
adsorption rate gets slowed down when the DBT molecules traverse further deep into the
microspores and experience larger resistance in the later stage.49
Thus, to get a better understanding of DBT adsorption on PMACs, pseudo first order and the
second order models were used to obtain the kinetics data.

3.5.1 Pseudo First Order Kinetics
Pseudo first order kinetics assumes that DBT molecules are nondissociating on the
surface of PMACs and no DBT molecule is present initially on the surface of the
adsorbents PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4. The pseudo first order kinetics is given
by50,51 16  where qe, and
qt are sulfur adsorbed at equilibrium and at time
t. k1 (1/min) is the rate constant of
pseudo first order adsorption.

3.5.2 Pseudo Second Order Kinetics
It is given by52 17  

The linear log(qe –
qt) versus t was used
for the pseudo first order kinetic model and the
t/qt versus
t plot was used for the pseudo second order kinetic model as shown in
Figure 4. The estimated kinetic parameters
are given in Table 3. Lower values of ARE and
NSD and higher values of R2 values generally show the good
fitting with the experimental data. It was observed that DBT removal by PMACs follows
pseudo second order kinetics.

3.6 Diffusion Mechanism
The adsorbate transportation from bulk solution to the adsorbent surface may be
controlled by single or multiple mechanisms,53 that is, film or
external diffusion, surface diffusion, pore diffusion, or a combination of two. The system
controlled by film diffusion may have poor mixing, lower adsorbate concentration, small
adsorbent particle size, and higher affinity between the adsorbate and adsorbent.
Similarly, the intraparticle diffusion controls the system where the mixing is proper,
high adsorbate concentration and lower affinity of the adsorbate for the adsorbent.54 18   19  where F =
qt/qe is the
fraction of equilibrium attained, Bt is the function of
F.

The diffusion mechanisms affecting the kinetics are given by Weber’s intraparticle
and Boyd’s surface diffusion model.55 The intraparticle
diffusion-controlled mechanism is given
by 20  where Kid
is the coefficient of intraparticle diffusion (mg/g(min)0.5) and
C depicts the boundary layer thickness (boundary resistance). The
surface diffusion controller mechanism is defined by Boyd’s kinetic
expression.56

The intercept and slope of the linear plot
qt versus t0.5
given in Figure 5a are calculated to obtain the
intraparticle diffusion coefficient Kid and
boundary resistance C, respectively. If the overall adsorption data
exhibit multilinear plots, then two or more steps control the diffusion. As shown in Figure 5a, PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 plots are not linear
for the overall range; this concludes that one or more processes are influencing the
adsorption. Hence, the adsorption process follows a complex mechanism, having both surface
and intraparticle diffusion within the pores of PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4.57

Figure 5 Intraparticle diffusion of DBT by (a) Weber and Morris Model (b) Boyd kinetic model
for DBT adsorption.

The initial and final linear portion shows the surface adsorption58
and intraparticle diffusion effect,47 respectively. The nearly parallel
final segment of the plots suggests the comparability of adsorption rates for DBT into the
PMAC pores at all temperatures. Further, to find the slowest step between intraparticle
and surface diffusion, the Boyd kinetic model, eq 20, was used to further examine the kinetic data. The
R2 values of Boyd’s plots given in Figure 5b, for both PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 confirms that the
plot is linear. Thus, surface diffusion seems to be the rate-controlling step in the
adsorption for both PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4. The intercept values are given in Table 4. As given in the table the boundary layer
thickness of PMAC 1/4 is greater than that of PMAC 1/3; thus, PMAC 1/4 is more surface
diffusion controlled compared to PMAC 1/3. This conclusion is also well supported by the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4, as shown in Figure 6, PMAC 1/3 is more porous in nature and
therefore, it has lower surface diffusion resistance for the DBT molecule to be adsorbed
on the surface than PMAC 1/4. This result also explains the less pore
diffusion-controlling mechanism for PMAC 1/3.

3.7 Thermodynamic Studies
The temperature effect on DBT adsorption on PMACs was studied as presented in Figure 7. It was found that with increasing
temperature sulfur removal decreases as shown Figure 7a. The reduction in adsorption of DBT on PMACs with increase in temperature
shows that the adsorption is following physisorption phenomena. The
ΔG° was calculated by using eq 21 whereas ΔS° and
ΔH° were determined from the intercept and slope of the
linear Van’t Hoff plot between ln Kd and
1/T as shown in Figure 7b,
which depicts the thermodynamic behavior of the adsorption process. The
ΔG° was evaluated by the given
equation 21    where
ΔG° is the change is Gibb’s free energy,
Kd is the distribution coefficient, R is
the gas constant and T is temperature in K. The Van’t Hoff
equation was used to calculate the ΔH° and change in entropy
ΔS° 22

for thermodynamic behavior of DBT on PMAC 1/3 and PMAC 1/4 using Van’t Hoff
equation.

Thermodynamic parameters of the system are shown in Table 5. The negative ΔG° value confirms
spontaneity and feasibility of the system.45 The negative values of
ΔH° confirm that the overall adsorption process is
exothermic in nature. Negative ΔS° values indicate the
decrease in the degree of freedom of the adsorbed DBT molecule on
PMACs.48−50

3.8 Design of Batch Sorption from Isotherm Data
The single-stage batch adsorption system can be designed using the adsorption
isotherm.44,54,59,60 A schematic diagram is shown in Figure 8 considering the volume of MDF,
V (L); the DBT concentration reduces from
C0 to C1 (mg/L), the DBT loading
changes from q0 to q1 (mg/g), and
the amount of adsorbent is M (mg). At time t = 0,
q0 = 0 and as time passes the mass balance equates DBT
removed from the MDF to that picked up by the solid. The mass balance equation for the
system shown in Figure 8a
is 23

Because the Sips isotherm fits the equilibrium data for DBT onto PMAC 1/3, the Sips
isotherm equation can be used to modify the batch adsorber design equation as presented
below 24  

Figure 8b shows the plot between the predicted
amount of PMAC 1/3 needed to remove different percentages of DBT from the MDF of initial
concentrations 500 mg/L at different solution volumes. The design procedure is defined for
a single-stage batch sorption system. For example, the quantity of PMAC 1/3 required for
the 90% removal of DBT from the MDF of concentration 500 mg/L was 97.21, 194.43, 291.64,
and 388.84 mg for MDF volumes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 L, respectively.

3.9 Effect of Aromatics on DBT Removal
It is a well-known fact that the aromatic compounds present in diesel generally compete
with the sulfur-bearing compounds to occupy the adsorption sites of most of the
adsorbents. Therefore, further study was conducted to investigate the effect of aromatics
present in MDF-A-α on DBT adsorption. The effect of aromatics present in the
MDF-A-α is shown in Figure 9. It can be
observed from the figure that the adsorption of aromatic compounds increases with
increasing the dosage of the adsorbent. The highest adsorption after DBT is shown by
fluorine followed by naphthalene and ethylbenzene. The results show that both adsorbents
have affinity for the aromatic compounds which may inhibit the sulfur removal capacity of
the adsorbent. To understand the inhibiting effect of aromatics, different weight % of the
aromatics was used and their effect on sulfur removal was examined as shown in Figure 10. It was noted that the increasing aromatic
concentration negatively impacted the sulfur uptake of the adsorbents. This arises because
of competitive adsorption between DBT and the aromatics resulting in decrease in sulfur
uptake. Similar to the results of sulfur removal from the MDF using PMACs 1/3 and 1/4,
PMAC 1/3 shows better performance for the removal of sulfur from MDF-A-α.

MDF-A-α with a change in the adsorbent weight (A) PMAC_1/3 (B) PMAC_1/4.

4 Conclusions
In this work, DBT adsorption capacity of PMACs has been studied. The study shows that the
desulfurization ability of PMAC 1/3 (84.56 mg/g) exhibits better performance compared to
PMAC 1/4 (74.25 mg/g). The higher desulfurization capabilities of PMAC 1/3 have direct
correspondence with the better microporosity. PMAC 1/3 follows Sips and PMAC 1/4 follows the
dual site Langmuir adsorption isotherms model. The diffusion of DBT in PMACs follows a
complex diffusion model which means both intraparticle and surface diffusions. In addition,
DBT adsorption on PMACs follows pseudo second order kinetics. The thermodynamic studies
revealed that the adsorption of DBT on PMACs is an exothermic and spontaneous process having
less randomness at the interface. Further, the present study significantly indicates that
the aromatics affects the adsorption of DBT on the PMACs.
