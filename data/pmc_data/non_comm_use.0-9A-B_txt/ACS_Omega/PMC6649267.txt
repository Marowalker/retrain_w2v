The adsorption behavior
of an organic dye, metanil yellow (My),
from water using micro–nano silica particles (MNSPs) was investigated.
MCM-41-like (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) MNSPs were synthesized
using tetraethoxy orthosilicate as a silica source and hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant under basic conditions. Comparative
studies were performed to assess the adsorption behaviors of the organic
dye using the as-synthesized MCM-41 before the removal of CTAB and
MCM-41, either after one, two, and three times of chemical etching
or after calcination. My was adsorbed more effectively from water
on the as-synthesized MCM-41 without the removal of the surfactant
than on MCM-41 after the removal of the surfactant by chemical etching
or calcination. In addition, MCM-41 after removing the surfactant
by one-time chemical etching in the presence of hydrochloric acid
also showed better adsorption of My from water than MCM-41 after removing
the surfactant by further two and three times of chemical etching
or calcination. For comparison, other kinds of dye molecules with
different chemical structures such as methylene blue (Mb) and rhodamine
B (Rb) were also used to check the possibility of adsorption of various
dyes by the CTAB-supported MNSPs. To better understand the reason
behind the adsorption phenomena, detailed studies on the kinetics
and thermodynamics of adsorption of the MNSPs were performed. Excellent
adsorption of My was observed at concentrations up to 100 mg L–1 at 25 °C, whereas the adsorption was lower at
higher concentrations of the My dye. Furthermore, enhanced My dye
adsorption was observed at higher concentrations by increasing the
adsorption temperature. It can be concluded that the MNSPs exhibited
efficient adsorption of My, when the MNSPs are used without the removal
of the surfactant and any further modifications, suggesting that the
surfactant played key roles in the effective adsorption of the anionic
dye. The as-synthesized MCM-41 was, however, not a good adsorbent
for cationic dyes such as Mb and Rb.

1 Introduction
The
leaching of organic dyes from textile and other industrial
wastewater is environmentally hazardous.1,2 In most cases,
the azo dyes in water are highly carcinogenic, toxic, and nonbiodegradable.
Azo dyes produce a range of side effects and diseases when exceeding
the allowed limits of organic dyes in drinking water. Metanil yellow
(My) is a typical azo dye with a molecular size of 18 Å ×
9 Å and is used generally as an additive or coloring agent in
the textile and food industries. Currently, a range of techniques,
such as photocatalytic degradation, adsorption, sedimentation, filtration,
electrochemical oxidation and reduction, biological treatment, ion
exchange, and degradation have been used to remove organic dyes from
wastewater.3 Among these, adsorption is
the most widely used method because of the removal capacity of large
quantities of organic dyes and good recyclability.

Various natural
and synthetic adsorbents have been used for the
adsorption of My dye from water.4,5 For example, a polyaniline–bentonite
composite (Bent–aminopropyltriethoxysilane–PANI) showed
an excellent adsorption of the azo dye from water with an adsorption
content of 444.44 mg g–1.6 Chemically cross-linked chitosan beads showed a pH-sensitive adsorption
behavior with a maximum adsorption of 1334 mg g–1 at pH 4 and 30 °C, whereas lower absorption was observed under
neutral and basic pH conditions.7 The higher
amount of My adsorption was due to the stronger interactions between
the dye anion and the NH3+ functional groups
in chitosan. Similarly, the glutaraldehyde cross-linked magnetic chitosan
nanoparticles also showed good adsorption of My at an acidic pH (pH
4) with a maximum adsorption capacity of 625 mg g–1.8 Various other kinds of surface-functionalized
materials were also used for the effective adsorption of the My dye.9,10 Most modified natural and synthetic materials are effective at acidic
pH than at neutral or basic pH because of the acidic nature of the
My dye, which is strongly attracted to the positively charged adsorbent.

Among the various adsorbents used for the adsorption of organic
dyes from water, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted
considerable attention for various applications because of the excellent
applicability of the use of mesoporous materials in metal ion adsorption,
organic dye adsorption, drug delivery, catalysis, oil adsorption,
and various energy and environmental applications.11−13 The main advantages
of MSNs are the presence of a large surface area and pore volume,
controlled pore diameter, uniform particle size, and easy surface
functionalization for diverse applications.11,12 The synthesis and functionalization of MSNs and their uses in the
removal of aqueous pollutants and wastewater treatments were briefly
reviewed in the literature.14,15 Boukoussa et al. studied
a yellow dye (acid yellow 49, molecular weight 426.27 g/mol) adsorption
by the calcined and uncalcined Al-MCM-41 (MCM-41; Mobil Composition
of Matter No. 41).16 They reported a better
adsorption behavior of yellow dye in both cases of adsorption which
was mainly because of the strong electrostatic force between the adsorbent
and the dye molecules than the hydrogen-bonding or van der Waals interactions.
They also suggested a better adsorption percentage (∼92%) at
basic pH (pH 10) than acidic pH (pH 2) as well as the presence of
larger amounts of aluminum (Al) in the silicone mixture. A lower dye
adsorption percentage (∼10%) was observed at a lower pH (pH
2) and low Si/Al ratio mixtures.16 This
clearly suggests that the presence of aluminum plays a vital role
in the adsorption of larger amounts of yellow dye from water, even
in the presence (33 mg g–1) or absence (44 mg g–1) of surfactants. The adsorption and removal efficiency
of various acid dyes was studied by the synthesized SBA-3 and various
amino-functionalized SBA-3.17 The results
suggested that the adsorption capacity was increased by the amino
functionalization of calcined SBA-3 because of the stronger electrostatic
attraction between the positively charged amine functional group and
the negatively charged dye.

Our group reported the succinamic
acid-functionalized MCM-41 (SAMCM-41)
for the adsorption of My with the support of rhodamine 6G (R6G).18 The results suggested that SAMCM-41 showed more
adsorption of R6G and methylene blue (Mb) and less adsorption of My
when the adsorption experiment was carried out in individual dye solutions.
At the same time, My adsorption by SAMCM-41 increased when a binary
mixture of My and R6G was used. This suggests that My adsorption was
induced by the presence of R6G. The experiment, however, was not performed
to examine the adsorption behavior of My by the synthesized MCM-41
(with or without a surfactant). Recently, the authors’ group
also functionalized MCM-41 with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) and examined the adsorption behavior of rhodamine B (Rb)
and Mb.11 PNIPAM-MCM-41 showed a better
adsorption of Rb dye than Mb. In addition, less adsorption of these
dyes was observed on the unmodified MCM-41.

To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, however, previous
works neither dealt with the adsorption of My dye in the as-synthesized
MCM-41 nor investigated the effect of the hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) surfactant on the adsorption of My. In most cases,
the surfactant present in the mesoporous material was removed by either
calcination or chemical etching than other methods, prior to the adsorption
or functionalization of the material for further applications because
the surfactant-removed material by the above methods can exhibit higher
surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter than the as-synthesized
material. Calcination is carried out generally in air atmosphere at
above 500 °C for a certain time to decompose the surfactant in
the MSNs, whereas chemical etching was done by leaching of the surfactant
using ethanol and hydrochloric acid with certain washing cycles.19,20 The present work mainly focuses on the role of the CTAB surfactant
in the adsorption and removal of the My dye from an aqueous medium.
In this work, therefore, the adsorption behavior of My on the MCM-41-like
micro–nanosilica particles (MNSPs) was systematically investigated.
For this purpose, three types of MCM-41-like MNSPs were prepared:
as-synthesized MCM-41 and MCM-41 with the surfactant removed either
by a chemical treatment or by calcination. In addition, we also checked
the possibility of adsorption of other kinds of dyes such as Mb and
Rb by the above materials because these dyes have chemical structures
different from that of My. The chemical structures of My, Mb, and
Rb are shown in Figure S1. The obtained
results suggest that MNSPs in the presence of surfactant as well as
after one-time chemical etching (not complete removal) showed a much
favorable adsorption of My than the MNSPs after complete surfactant
removal (two and three times of chemical etching) and also exhibited
better adsorption of My than the other kinds of dyes (Mb and Rb).
Furthermore, the adsorption behavior of My from water by the MNSPs
prepared in the presence of surfactant as well as after one-time chemical
etching was investigated more systematically based on kinetic and
thermodynamic analyses.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Functional and Structural Analysis
Figure 1A presents
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MCM-41 before (MCM-416-BCE) and after the CTAB surfactant removal by one-time chemical
etching (MCM-416-ACE1) or calcination (MCM-416-AC). The as-synthesized MCM before surfactant removal showed
strong C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks at 2927,
2855, and 1477 cm–1, indicating the presence
of surfactant in the material (Figure 1A(a)).11,12 The Si–O–Si peak
in the material appeared at 1227, 1078, 797, and 457 cm–1. Similarly, the Si–OH peak and surface-adsorbed water molecules
appeared at 3409, 960, and 1640 cm–1, respectively.
Significant disappearance of the C–H asymmetric and symmetric
stretching peaks was observed in the surfactant-removed MCM-41 by
one-time chemical etching, but a trivial quantity of C–H peaks
remained even after one-time chemical etching, which suggests that
one-time acid washing is not enough to remove the surfactant completely
from the material (Figure 1A(b)). In contrast, MCM-41 after removing the surfactant by
calcination in air atmosphere at 540 °C for 8 h showed an almost
complete removal of the surfactant (Figure 1A(c)). The CTAB surfactant removal from MCM-416-BCE was also checked further by two times (MCM-416-ACE2) and three times (MCM-416-ACE3) of chemical etching cycles. The presence of CTAB in the material
was monitored by the FTIR spectra. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching
peaks because of the presence of CTAB almost disappeared from the
material after three times of chemical etching (Figure S2A).

MCM-41
(MCM-416-BCE) and (b,c) MCM-41 after the removal of the
surfactant by one-time chemical etching (MCM-416-ACE1) and calcination (MCM-416-AC) at 540 °C for
8 h, respectively.

The structural property
of the synthesized material was confirmed
further by low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1B). The as-synthesized MCM-41 showed typical
(100), (110), and (200) peaks for both MNSPs before and after one-time
chemical etching of the surfactant, whereas the above peaks for the
as-synthesized MCM-41 were broad with a lower intensity caused by
blocking of the pore structure by the surfactant (Figure 1B(a)).11,12 The intensity of the (100), (110), and (200) peaks were increased
for MCM-41 after one-time chemical etching of the surfactant and further
increased for MCM-41 after two and three times of chemical etching
(Figures 1B(b) and S2B). The intensity of the peaks became much
stronger and narrower and a slight shift to a lower angle was observed
by removing the surfactant by two and three consecutive etching cycles,
whereas the shift in the peak positions was observed toward a higher
angle in the calcined MCM-41 (Figures 1B(b),(c) and S2B).11,21 The more intense peak and slight shift in the peak position of the
chemical-etched and calcined MCM-41 are more likely because of the
removal of the surfactant that results in a more pronounced contrast
in electron density between the walls and empty pores.22 Moreover, there was no pore expansion because
of a silica network contraction during the calcination process, which
was also observed by N2 physisorption experiments.22

The mesoporous structure was confirmed
further by analyzing the
nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the synthesized materials
before and after surfactant removal by one-time chemical etching and
calcination, as shown in Figure S3 (in the Supporting Information),11,23 from which the surface areas
and pore sizes (volumes and diameters) were estimated as in Table 1. The as-synthesized
MCM-41 showed a lower surface area (42 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.194 cm3 g–1) because
of the blocking of the pore channels by the surfactant. On the other
hand, the surface area (735 m2 g–1),
pore volume (0.325 cm3 g–1), and pore
diameter (3.5 nm) increased when the surfactant was removed by one-time
chemical etching. MCM-41 after surfactant removal by calcination also
showed a high surface area (735 m2 g–1) and uniform pore volume (0.142 cm3 g–1) as well as pore diameter (3.3 nm). The thermal stability of MCM-416-BCE, MCM-416-ACE1, and MCM-416-AC were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure S4. Generally, TGA analysis is done in
nitrogen atmosphere because this can control the preoxidation and
burning of a sample as compared to the air atmosphere. The TGA curve
of MCM-416-BCE in Figure S4a exhibited a large amount of surfactant present in the as-synthesized
MCM-41, which was confirmed from the major decomposition of the surfactant
in the temperature range of 30–300 and 300–550 °C,
with the corresponding decomposition weight percentage of 35% at 300
°C and further 2% decomposition at 550 °C. The decomposition
weight percentage at 550 °C suggests that ca. 37% of the CTAB
surfactant is present in the MNSPs. One-Time chemical-etched MNSPs
(MCM-416-ACE1) showed three major degradations
at 30–150, 150–300, and 300–675 °C because
of the loss of surface-adsorbed water and the remaining surfactant
in the material with the corresponding decomposition weight percentage
of 2, 8, and 12%, respectively (Figure S4b). This suggests that ca. 12% of surfactant is present in MCM-416-ACE1. On the other hand, there is no considerable
decomposition weight percentage encountered in the calcined sample
(MCM-416-AC) because most of the surfactant was removed
from the material during the calcination process, as evidenced in Figure S4c.

a Pore volume was obtained from the
BJH cumulative desorption pore volume.

The particle morphology of the synthesized materials
was examined
further by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Figure 2). MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 both showed the formation
of micro–nanoparticles having the size in the range of 100–615
nm (Figure 2a) and
160–615 nm (Figure 2b), respectively, which was also confirmed further by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS)
analysis [Figures S5A,B and S6A,B (in black)].
The size of MCM-41 synthesized in this work was slightly larger than
that of other MCM-41 (i.e., reported to be 80–350 nm11), plausibly because of the different assembly
of the silica precursor on the surfactant micelles during the bulk
scale of synthesis batch by a different rotation speed in comparison
to other reported MCM-41 that have been synthesized usually with a
small scale batch. In addition, the as-synthesized MCM-41 (MCM-412-BCE) with a reaction time of 2 h and one-time chemical-etched
(MCM-412-ACE1) materials produced micro–nanoparticles
with a larger size in the range of ca. 200 nm to 1 μm as compared
to the samples prepared under the reaction time of 6 h (Figures S7 and 2). The
larger particle size at 2 h suggests that tubular rod-shaped CTAB
micelles were formed at the initial stage, followed by hydrolysis
and condensation of the silica precursor on the micelles, resulting
in a larger particles size (Figure S7).
On the other hand, large micelles were broken into small ones with
continuous stirring, thus reducing the particle size at 6 h (Figure 2). In this way, MCM-416-AC also showed the particle size in the range of ca. 250–825
nm. This increase in the particle size is due to the occurrence of
some condensation reactions between the silica particles during calcination
[Figures S5C and S6C (black)]. The particle
size distribution histograms obtained from DLS clearly showed that
all the MNSPs synthesized in this work are among the category of micro–nanoparticles.
It is noteworthy, however, that the average particle size is in the
nanometer scale range with an average of 210 nm for both MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 and 320 nm for
MCM-416-AC (Figure S6A–C, black). These results suggest that the particle size can be tuned
based on the reaction time as well as the amount of component materials
used for the synthesis. The uneven particle shapes were seen from
the SEM and TEM images of the synthesized materials, where most of
the particles and some aggregates of two or three particles illustrate
oval shape, whereas some spherical shaped particles were also observed
from the synthesized materials (Figures 2, S5, and S7).

2.2 Effects of Various Parameters on My Adsorption
2.2.1 Comparison of My Adsorption by the As-Synthesized
MCM-41 with the Surfactant-Removed MCM-41
The My (100 mg
L–1) solution showed an acidic pH (pH 4) with a
strong and broad intense peak in the range from 335 to 550 nm with
a maximum intensity peak at 436 nm. First, the effect of the CTAB
surfactant on the My adsorption behavior was studied to check and
compare the role of CTAB in the adsorption behavior (Figure S8A). A 20 mg of CTAB surfactant was used to check
the adsorption and removal behavior of My by shaking the solution
for 120 min. The results indicated that the CTAB surfactant alone
has no significant My adsorption as well as the dye removal behavior,
whereas MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 can show excellent My dye removal in 120 min. The removal efficiency
of the My dye (with the concentration of 100 mg L–1) for both MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 was also monitored up to the adsorption time of 360 min.
An almost complete disappearance of the strong peak at 436 nm in 360
min by both MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 indicates the removal efficiency of ∼98 and 96% with
the calculated adsorption capacity (qe) of 49 and 48 mg g–1, respectively (Figure 3). On the other hand, only
3% (qe = 1.5 mg g–1)
of My adsorption was observed on MCM-41 after the complete surfactant
removal by calcination (Figure 3). The inset optical image in Figure 3 also proved the almost complete disappearance
of the My dye from water with trace amounts of yellow dye remaining
in the solution by further extending the adsorption time to 1440 min
(inset of Figure 3a–c),
which proved the superior adsorption of My by the as-synthesized MCM-41
in the presence of surfactant as well as one-time chemical-etched
MCM-41 to the calcined MCM-41. In contrast, the yellow color remained
in the solution, even after the adsorbent was kept for 1440 min or
longer for the calcined MCM-41 (inset image of Figure 3d). The dye removal efficiency of MCM-416-BCE, MCM-416-ACE1, and MCM-416-AC was also studied by using different kinds of dye molecules such
as Mb and Rb and compared with My because we would like to emphasize
the role of CTAB on the adsorption of different dye molecules (Figure 3). The results in Figure 3 and the inset image
of Figure 3 clearly
demonstrate the better adsorption of My for the as-synthesized MCM-41
with a surfactant and MCM-41 after one-time chemical etching, whereas
less adsorption was observed on the calcined MCM-41. On the other
hand, lower dye removal behaviors were observed with Mb and Rb for
MCM-416-BCE and MCM-412-ACE1 [5.2%
(qe = 2.6 mg g–1) and
6.2% (qe = 3.10 mg g–1), respectively] and [16% (qe = 8.13
mg g–1) and 7.4% (qe = 3.71 mg g–1), respectively], as compared with
My (∼96–98%) (inset images of Figure 3e,f). In contrast, more adsorption of Mb
and Rb was observed on calcined MCM-41 [40% (qe = 19.88 mg g–1) and 49% (qe = 24.33 mg g–1), respectively]. MCM-412-BCE and MCM-412-ACE1 with a larger
size of the micro- and nanoparticles, by reducing the reaction time,
would marginally adsorb more My because of the accumulation of higher
amounts of CTAB (Figure S8A). The obtained
results are enough to prove the possibility of effective adsorption
and removal of anionic dyes like My from the as-synthesized to surfactant-removed
MNSPs without any further modification. An increase in the size of
micro- and nanoparticles was also observed after the adsorption of
the My dye in the case of MCM-416-BCE, MCM-416-ACE1, and MCM-416-AC (Figure S6A–C, in red). Similar results were also obtained
for the Mb- and Rb-adsorbed MCM-416-BCE (Figure S6D, in red). The reason for the increase in the average
particle size in all the cases was mainly because of the strong interaction
and coverage of dye molecules on the surface of the materials, which
might eventually increase the average particle size. In particular,
particles of less than 200 nm for MCM-416-BCE, 250 nm or
above for MCM-416-ACE1, and 400 nm or above
for MCM-416-AC showed an increased average particle size
after the adsorption of dye molecules, which indicates the strong
interaction and coverage of dye molecules within these particle size
ranges, and even the dye-adsorbed materials are treated under ultrasonication
prior to the measurement.24,25

dye solutions (My, Mb, and Rb) with the same concentration (100 mg
L–1), sample loading weight (20 mg), and adsorption
time (360 min). Inset images of the figure show the My solution before
(a) and after the removal by MCM-416-BCE (b), MCM-416-ACE1 (c), and MCM-416-AC (d) in 1440
min, as well as Mb solution (e) and Rb solution (f) by MCM-416-BCE in 1440 min, respectively.

In general, the My dye is acidic because of the presence
of SO3– groups, which have much stronger
affinity
to positively charged materials. Therefore, most studies focused on
the modification of a material with an amine functional group because
this can be protonated easily in an acidic medium, which leads to
a better adsorption of My from water. On the other hand, this study
focused on the My adsorption for the MNSPs without and with the removal
of the CTAB surfactant by both chemical etching and calcination and
without any further modification because the material itself showed
a better adsorption of My. The reason behind the adsorption behavior
of My by the as-synthesized MCM-41 as well as the surfactant-removed
materials was investigated systematically by their zeta potential
values. MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 showed zeta potential values of 17.57 and −10.3 mV, respectively,
whereas MCM-41-AC exhibited a much higher negative zeta potential
value of −31.7 mV (Table 1). The positive charge for MCM-416-BCE and
smaller negative charge for MCM-416-ACE1 before
the removal of a considerable amount of surfactant might explain the
better adsorption of My by ionic and electrostatic interactions between
any of the two materials and dye molecules. On the other hand, the
smaller amount of My adsorption by the calcined MCM-41 must be because
of the higher negative zeta potential value that restricts the adsorption
of My by the negative–negative repulsion between the adsorbent
and dye molecules.18 The zeta potential
values of the dye-adsorbed materials are discussed again further in section 2.2.2.

The role of CTAB for My adsorption was further investigated with
two and three times chemical-etched MNSPs by comparing with MCM-416-ACE1 as well as MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-AC (Figure S8B). The obtained
results suggest that two and three times of chemical etching would
completely remove the CTAB surfactant from the material and yielded
a very low percentage removal [7.5% (MCM-416-ACE2) and 2.7% (MCM-416-ACE3)] of My as compared
to that of MCM-416-BCE and as MCM-416-ACE1. The adsorption percentage of MCM-416-ACE2 and MCM-416-ACE3 is almost similar
to that of MCM-416-AC. In addition, comparative studies
were also attempted on My adsorption from the commercial silica dioxide
nanopowder (SiNPs, particle size 10–20 nm) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
as well as calcined SiNPs at the same condition of 540 °C for
8 h with a saturation time of 9 h. Both the pristine and calcined
SiNPs also exhibited a very low percentage (2.5 and 8.2%, respectively)
of My adsorption (Figure S8B). The obtained
results clearly prove the essential role of the CTAB surfactant in
the MNSPs for the adsorption of the My dye.

2.2.2 Effects
of Time, Adsorbent Weight, and pH
of the Solution on My Adsorption
The kinetics of adsorption
was analyzed by keeping the My solution under various shaking times
from 30 to 1440 min by monitoring the dye removal behavior for both
MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 (Figure 4A). The results suggest
that My adsorption was induced immediately by the addition of both
adsorbents, and almost 80–90% of the My dye had been removed
from the starting solution in the first 30 min and the remaining dye
molecule was adsorbed slowly. The maximum My adsorption was observed
within 240–360 min, followed by saturation. Therefore, the
adsorption time was kept to a maximum of 360 min for further analysis
of the adsorption behaviors. Figure 4A clearly shows that the as-synthesized MCM-41 had
a better dye removal ability of My (before removing the surfactant)
than MCM-41 after removing the surfactant.

Figure 4 (A) Dye removal percentages
of My by MCM-416-BCE (a)
and MCM-416-ACE1 (b) at various adsorption times
(30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 360, 720, and 1440 min). (B) Dye
removal percentages at various pH (pH 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) of both
adsorbents [concentration (100 mg L–1), sample loading
weight (20 mg), and adsorption time (6 h)].

The zeta potential of the dye-adsorbed (360 min) MCM-416-BCE, MCM-416-ACE1, and MCM-416-AC
were measured by removing the water medium in the suspension and drying
in an oven overnight at 80 °C. The dried samples were dispersed
in water prior to the measurement of the zeta potential values. The
samples showed a slightly reduced positive value for MCM-416-BCE (16.93 mV) and an increased negative value for MCM-416-ACE1 (−18.53 mV) compared to the zeta potentials
of MCM-416-BCE (17.57 mV) and MCM-416-ACE1 (−10.3 mV) before the adsorption of the dye molecules.
In contrast, MCM-416-AC showed the zeta potential value
of −20.2 mV, whereas MCM-416-AC exhibited the value
of −31.7 mV. The adsorption of the My dye from water is affected
by the difference in the zeta potential values before and after the
adsorption of the dye molecules, in other words, the difference in
the surface charge of the materials. In the same manner, Mb- and Rb-adsorbed
MCM-416-BCE showed a slight reduction in the positive zeta
potential values, that is, −0.758 and 0.025 mV, respectively,
in comparison to those of MCM-416-BCE before Mb and Rb
adsorption.

Furthermore, the adsorption and the percentage of
the dye removal
efficiency of My were measured based on the amount of adsorbents (MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1). Adsorbent amounts
of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg, respectively, were used in the given
amount of dye solution (10 mL) for 360 min. Better adsorption and
removal efficiency of the My dye from water were observed by increasing
the adsorbent amount to 20 mg or higher (Figure S9A). In addition, the dye removal percentage of My was also
measured at various pH (pH 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) for both MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 (Figure 4B). The results show that the
as-synthesized MCM-41 (i.e., MCM-416-BCE) in the presence
of a surfactant shows better My removal from water, regardless of
the pH of the dye solution, whereas the removal percentage was higher
under acidic conditions and the dye removal efficiency was lower under
neutral and basic conditions for MCM-416-ACE1 (Figure 4B). Figure S9B shows the result relating to whether
the CTAB surfactant leaches from the as-synthesized MCM-416-BCE. For this leaching study, 20 mg of the sample was dispersed
in 10 mL of water at pH 4 under an 180 rpm shaking speed. The CTAB
solution was also prepared with the same conditions as a reference
solution. The leaching was monitored at different times (2, 4, and
6 h) by UV–visible spectrophotometry. The results clearly show
that there is no considerable leaching of CTAB during the shaking
of the material at pH 4.

2.2.3 Effects of the Dye Solution
Concentration
and Temperature on My Adsorption
Further, the adsorption
of My was examined as a function of the dye concentration as well
as the adsorption temperatures of the adsorbate and the My solution
(Figure 5). The plot
was drawn against the concentrations of the My dye and the adsorption
maximum at 436 nm with respect to the temperature of the adsorption
medium (Figure 5A).
MCM-416-BCE showed a better adsorption of the My dye at
25 °C when the concentration of the dye solution reached 100
mg L–1, whereas the level of My adsorption decreased
with an increasing concentration (150, 200, and 250 mg L–1) for MCM-416-BCE (Figure 5A,C). Figure 5C presents the percentage of dye removal for MCM-416-BCE. Similar adsorption and dye removal behaviors were also observed
for MCM-416-ACE1 (Figure 5B,D). The level of My adsorption increased
with an increasing temperature of the dye solution for both MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1, but the effect
of temperature was observed more clearly for MCM-416-BCE
than MCM-416-ACE1.

concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg L–1) at different temperatures [(b) 25, (c) 30, and (d) 35 °C (d)],
where (a) is the UV–vis absorbance at 436 nm of the My solution

(360 min) and sample loading weight (20 mg)).

2.3 Kinetics of My Adsorption
The detailed
mechanism of My adsorption of MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 was analyzed based on pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (equations are described in
the Supporting Information). Figure 6 shows that the adsorption
of the materials mainly followed pseudo-second-order kinetics (Figure 6C,D) than pseudo-first-order
kinetics (Figure 6A,B).
In addition, the R2 values in Figure 6C,D are closer to
1 for both samples as compared to that in Figure 6A,B. The results suggest that chemisorption
is more preferable for the adsorption of My rather than physisorption
for both materials and that chemisorption was the rate-limiting step.26Table 2 lists the kinetic parameter values predicted from the pseudo-first-
and pseudo-second-order plots.

2.4 IntraParticle Diffusion
The intraparticle
diffusion mechanism of My adsorption was analyzed by plotting qt veruss t1/2 (the equation is available in the Supporting Information, Figure S10). The intercept and slope
obtained from the plot indicates the adsorption behavior of My. In
addition, the R2 value obtained from the
plot also suggests the diffusion mechanism as well as the chemical
or physical adsorption behavior of the adsorbents. MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 both showed R2 < 1, which indicates that the intraparticulate diffusion
does not occur in the materials.27,28 The intraparticle
diffusion rate constant (Kid) from the
slope and intercept (C) values indicates a multistep
adsorption process (Table 2). The dye molecules may be adsorbed initially on the outer
surface of the MNSPs followed by diffusion into the interior. The
adsorption and diffusion of dye molecules into the mesoporous channels
and the outer channel can occur simultaneously.

2.5 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption
isotherms were analyzed from the adsorption values of My at various
concentrations (50–250 mg L–1). The Langmuir,
Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption isotherms were compared for those
adsorbents at various concentrations (Figure 7). Details of the isotherm equations are
provided in the Supporting Information.
In addition, the adsorption isotherms were also analyzed at various
adsorption temperatures of the above solutions. The results showed
that MCM-416-BCE have R2 ≈
1 at all temperatures, suggesting the linear adsorption of My by the
adsorbent, and that the adsorption behavior follows the Langmuir model
(Figure 7A,C,E). Furthermore,
the increased adsorption temperatures should lead to better adsorption
at high My concentrations by the adsorbent and much higher adsorption
capacity following the Langmuir isotherm (Figure 7A,C,E, Table 3). The adsorption capacity was increased from 78 to
125 mg g–1 by increasing the temperature. Similarly,
MCM-416-ACE1 also showed better adsorption capacity
of My at higher temperatures during the adsorption (Figure S11A,C,E, Table S1). MCM-416-ACE1 also showed an R2 value closer to 1 and also followed the linear adsorption of My.
On the other hand, MCM-416-ACE1 had a lower
adsorption capacity of My (48–61 mg g–1)
compared to the adsorption capacity of MCM-416-BCE, as
listed in Tables 3 and
S1.

a R2––regression

Furthermore, the Freundlich adsorption isotherms of My by MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 were analyzed
at the same concentrations and temperatures (Figures 7B,D,F, S11B,D,F, Tables 3 and S1).
The R2 values (closer to 1) at 30 °C
yielded a linear adsorption behavior for MCM-416-BCE, whereas R2 was lower at 25 °C, and at 35 °C,
a nonlinear adsorption behavior was observed for the Freundlich isotherm
model (Table 3). Similarly,
MCM-416-ACE1 also showed a nonlinear adsorption
behavior at all temperatures (Figure S11B,D,F and Table S1). The results showed that
MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 exhibit
a linear adsorption behavior and more favorable My adsorption according
to the Langmuir isotherm model than the Freundlich isotherm model.
In addition, the Temkin adsorption behavior of My was analyzed at
different concentrations and temperatures. The obtained graph also
showed the linear adsorption isotherms at all temperatures for MCM-416-BCE and nonlinear adsorption for MCM-416-ACE1 (Figure S12).

2.6 Thermodynamics of Adsorption
The
thermodynamics of adsorption of My was analyzed further from 298 to
308 K (Figure 8). The
increase in temperature from 298 to 303 and 308 K for the dye solutions
with shaking showed an increase in My adsorption and dye removal efficiency.
The better dye removal percentage at 298 K was observed only up to
the concentration of 100 mg L–1, whereas it was
lower at higher concentrations from 150 to 250 mg L–1. On the other hand, the increase in the solution temperature resulted
in better adsorption, even at higher concentrations of dye molecules
in water than the adsorption experiment carried out at 298 K (Figure 8). In addition, a
better adsorption of My by MCM-416-BCE than MCM-416-ACE1 was observed at higher concentrations and
temperatures (Figure 8). Furthermore, the obtained values were analyzed by the thermodynamic
parameters for the My adsorption by both MCM-416-BCE and
MCM-416-ACE1. Details of the thermodynamic equations
are supplied in the Supporting Information. To determine the thermodynamic parameters, a log Ke versus 1/T plot was prepared, where Ke = (qe/qt), qe (mg g–1) is the adsorption capacity at
equilibrium; qt (mg g–1) is the amount of My adsorbed after time t (min), and T is the absolute temperature
of the dye solution (Figure 8). The enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy
(ΔS°) changes were estimated from the
slope and intercept (Figure 8). The Gibbs free energy (ΔG°)
was calculated at various temperatures from the equation provided
in the Supporting Information. The results
are listed in Table S2. The ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° values changed based on the concentrations of the
solutions (Table S2). The positive values
of ΔH° indicate an endothermic reaction,
which means that the adsorption increases with increasing temperature.29 The positive ΔH°
value also proves the enhanced adsorption of My at higher temperatures,
which agrees with the results shown in Figure 8. Similarly, the negative ΔG° values indicate the spontaneous adsorption of My
by the adsorbents. Figure S13 shows the
free-energy change against various temperatures and concentrations.
The adsorbent may help to remove the dye molecules from water at higher
temperatures that lead to adsorb a larger amount of dye molecules
by the adsorbent. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated further using the modified Arrhenius equation.29 The activation energy of the adsorbent was analyzed
at various solution concentrations by plotting ln(1 – θ)
versus 1/T, as shown in Figure S13. An increase in Ea (66–138
kJ mol–1) was observed for MCM-416-BCE
with increasing solution concentration. The higher activation energy
of the adsorbent was attributed to the chemisorption process of My.29 Similar results were also obtained for MCM-416-ACE1.

Figure 8 Thermodynamic plot of My adsorption by MCM-416-BCE (A)
and MCM-416-ACE1 (B) at various concentrations.

On the basis of the isotherm analyses
and dye removal results of
MCM-416-BCE and MCM-416-ACE1 at various
My concentrations and adsorption times, it can be concluded that the
My adsorption is highly favorable for MCM-416-BCE than
MCM-416-ACE1, and further the adsorption is
increased by increasing the adsorption temperature. In addition, the
adsorption behaviors of both materials obey well the pseudo-second-order
kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models. Moreover, the linear relationship
suggests that the dye molecules are adsorbed on the absorbent mainly
by the monolayer type of chemisorption.29

3 Conclusions
We synthesized MCM-41-like
MNSPs and also studied the adsorption
behaviors of organic dyes. The as-synthesized MCM-41 showed a better
adsorption behavior of the My organic dye from water in the presence
of a surfactant than MCM-41 when the surfactant was removed by one-time
chemical etching. In contrast, very small or almost negligible adsorption
of My was observed when the surfactant was removed almost completely
from water, as observed with two and three times of chemical etching
as well as calcined MCM-41. The kinetic experiments indicated the
linear adsorption of My that followed pseudo-second-order kinetics.
Furthermore, the adsorption of My also followed the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm model. The thermodynamic adsorption isotherms suggested an
increase in adsorption with increasing temperature. The study also
showed that higher My adsorption was observed in all concentrations
of the My solution by increasing the adsorption temperature from 25
to 35 °C. Overall, the results revealed the effective use of
MCM-41 for the adsorption of My in water when it is prepared without
removing the surfactant present in the MCM-41 material as compared
to the case of removing the CTAB surfactant in the material. In addition,
the study also shows that My adsorption by MCM-41 can be tuned by
controlling the surfactant-removal process in the material without
further modifications.

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Materials
Tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS), CTAB, 70% My dye content (acid yellow 36), Mb (≥95%),
and Rb (≥95%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anhydrous ethanol
(EtOH, 99.8%) was purchased from CARLO ERBA Reagents Co., Ltd. Sodium
hydroxide (NaOH, 97%) was provided by Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd. Concentrated
HCl (37%) was supplied by Matsuneon Chemical Ltd. Double deionized
water was used throughout the experiment. All the materials were used
without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
of MCM-41
MCM-41 was synthesized
according to the reported procedure with a slight modification.11 The CTAB (7.5 g) template was dissolved in deionized
water (720 mL) and ethanol (180 mL) in a 1000 mL round-bottom flask
at 1000 rpm in an oil bath at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2 M, 9 mL) was added to the
solution and kept stirring followed by the slow addition of TEOS (42
mL) precursor with stirring for a further 6 h. The obtained material
was purified by washing several times with water and ethanol and drying
overnight at 80 °C. The as-synthesized MCM-41 before surfactant
removal is named MCM-416-BCE. The template present in the
as-synthesized MCM-41 was removed from the material by either a chemical
etching or calcination method. Chemical etching was carried out by
taking a certain amount of the as-synthesized MCM-41 (2.5) in a 250
mL round-bottom flask and dispersing it with 95 mL of ethanol and
5 mL of concentrated HCl for 24 h at room temperature. The one-time
chemical-etched sample was washed several times by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm with an excess of deionized water and ethanol
followed by drying overnight at 80 °C and is named MCM-416-ACE1. Similarly, for MCM-416-ACE2 and MCM-416-ACE3, the second and third
time of chemical etching, respectively, was performed by taking 0.5
g MCM-416-ACE1 and 0.5 g MCM-416-ACE2 with 45 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of HCl with 12 h of stirring
for both materials, following the similar procedure as for MCM-416-ACE1. In addition, the surfactant was removed
by calcination at 540 °C for 8 h with a saturation time of 9
h at a desirable temperature and is named MCM-416-AC. BCE
and ACE denote MCM before and after chemical etching, whereas AC represents
after calcination. A similar experiment was also carried out except
that MCM-41 was prepared with stirring for only 2 h after the addition
of TEOS. These samples are named MCM-412-BCE and MCM-412-ACE1.

4.3 Organic Dye Adsorption
A 100 mg L–1 of My dye solution was prepared
by dissolving 100
mg of My in water (900 mL) and ethanol (100 mL). This solution is
named as the “My solution” in the Results
and Discussion section. The My solution showed an acidic pH
(pH 4). A 10 mL sample of the prepared My (10 mL) solution was taken
in a 20 mL glass container followed by the addition of 20 mg of the
sample (MCM-416-BCE) and kept in a water bath shaker at
25 °C and 180 rpm shaking speed with different adsorption times
(30–1440 min). The adsorption ability of the organic dye was
analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy at 436 nm. The experiment was
also performed with Mb and Rb dye solutions after 1440 min of shaking
with a similar procedure, and the adsorption of the dye was monitored
with their maximum peak intensity values of 664 and 554 nm. The adsorption
of My was carried out further with various concentrations of the My
dye (50, 150, 200, and 250 mg L–1) as well as various
amounts of MCM-41 (10, 30, 40, and 50 mg). The effects of pH on the
adsorption of My was also compared at various pH values (pH 2, 4,
6, 8, and 10).

The amount of My adsorption by the as-synthesized
MCM-41 as well as surfactant-removed MCM-41 materials was calculated
using the following eq 1 1  where qe, Co, and Ce represent
the amount of dye adsorption at equilibrium and the concentrations
(mg L–1) of the solution at the initial and equilibrium
conditions, respectively. V is the volume of the
solution (L) and W represents the mass of the adsorbent
(g) used for adsorption.

The percentage of dye removal from
the organic dye solution was
calculated using eq 2 2  

4.4 Characterization
The functional group
present in the synthesized MCM-41 was analyzed by FTIR [JASCO (FTIR-4100)]
spectroscopy. The FTIR measurements were taken between 400 and 4000
cm–1 by mixing the synthesized sample with potassium
bromide (KBr) and making a pellet. The mesoporous structure and crystalline
nature of the synthesized materials were studied by low-angle XRD
(Miniflex goniometer using Cu Kα irradiation) at a scanning
range of 1.2°–10.0° 2θ with a scanning speed
of 0.01° 2θ. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
at 77 K were obtained using a surface area and pore size analyzer
(Micromeritics ASAP 2020 V3.04 G). Prior to the measurements, each
sample was outgassed for 12 h under vacuum at 353 K. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area. The
pore volume was obtained from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) cumulative desorption pore volume curves because of the presence
of some interparticular porosity. The pore size distribution was obtained
from an analysis of the adsorption branch using the BJH method. The
surface morphology of the synthesized MCM-41 was analyzed by FESEM
(SUPRA25). The samples were loaded on a carbon tape and coated with
platinum before the measurements. The surface morphology was also
analyzed further by TEM (Hitachi H-7600). The measurement was performed
by dispersing the sample in ethanol and loading the material on a
copper grid by dipping followed by drying using an air dryer. The
particle sizes of the synthesized and the dye-adsorbed materials were
measured by DLS (Zetasizer Nano S90, Malvern Instruments Ltd.). The
samples were dispersed in water, with ultrasonication for 30 min prior
to the measurement. The surface charge present in the material was
measured using Malvern Zetasizer Software v7.11 PSS0012-37. The samples
were arranged by dispersing in deionized water. The zeta potentials
were calculated by measuring the dispersion three times and the average
values were obtained. TGA (TGA Q50 V6.2 Build 187, TA Instruments,
USA) was used to estimate the thermal stability of the materials with
a constant nitrogen flow (100 mL min–1) at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1. The dye adsorption behavior
of the synthesized materials was measured by UV–visible spectrophotometry
(Hitachi U-2010). The scanning range of 300–800 nm and a scanning
rate of 1 nm/s were used for the measurements. The optical images
were captured on a Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile (16 megapixels, rear side
camera) with a resolution of 1440 × 2560 pixels.
