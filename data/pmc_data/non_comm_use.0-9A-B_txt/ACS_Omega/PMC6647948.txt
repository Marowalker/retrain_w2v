The aqueous properties of the drugs
Sorafenib, Lapatinib, Gefitinib,
Fulvestrant, and Clofazimine were explored to monitor their tendency
to self-associate. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamics
light scattering, and electron and confocal microscopies found that
they tended to form large nano-entities having distinct types and
sizes and were capable of entering cells. The combination of strategies
employed serves to detect and reveal nano-entities along with their
three-state equilibria and behaviors in buffers, media, and cells.

Introduction
The drug discovery
community has recognized that the physicochemical
attributes of compounds can somehow predispose them to many properties,1−9 so pharma workflows focus on prioritizing compound candidates that
exhibit favorable properties and deprioritizing those that have undesirable
properties. For this, extensive characterization efforts are undertaken.

For many reasons, these characterization efforts are executed and
interpreted within the context that compounds in aqueous solvent behave
predominantly as either single-molecules in solution or as a solid
form such as precipitates. However, it is becoming more apparent that
each compound exists in a unique three-phase equilibrium in solution
between single lone-tumbling molecules, self-associated aggregates
(nano-entities), and solid forms. Although this revised view recognizes
the existence of this intermediate aggregate phase, it is becoming
clear that drugs can form a wider range of self-assembled nano-entities
than previously expected.10,12

To date, little
is known about the full range of types and sizes
of self-assemblies that drugs can adopt. There have been reports that
some can form colloidal aggregates, whereas others can form much smaller
multimers.10 One of the main issues for
properly characterizing these nano-entities is insufficient detection
strategies, which explains our poor knowledge of this phenomenon and
the resultant properties.11−14 No single technology can detect the full range of
nano-entities that can exist, but each technology has its advantages
and limitations. For example, dynamics light scattering (DLS) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are sensitive to large colloidal
assemblies (e.g., nanometer size) but are less optimal for small entities
and mixtures. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, on the
other hand, is highly sensitive to small- to medium-sized aggregates
(Ångstrom to subnanometer sizes). This technology can also be
used to monitor large aggregates although it requires breaking the
aggregates into smaller entities using detergents for detection purposes.
Also, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) can be employed to
monitor drugs in cells, but the compounds must be fluorescent and
form sufficiently large assemblies. Other potential detection methods
can also be used such as nephelometry, SPR, MST, DOSY NMR, and CPMG
NMR.

Establishing appropriate detection strategies will be central
for
thoroughly correlating nano-entities with their respective properties.
Impressive examples have already begun to emerge that demonstrate
serious impact on drug discovery efforts. Compound and drug aggregates
have been attributed to the observation of promiscuity and high incidences
of false-positives in high-throughput screens for lead discovery.13,14 They have also been implicated in affecting the efficacy of drugs
in cell culture assays because of lack of cell membrane permeability.15 This has helped to explain the “bell-shaped”
concentration response curves for formulated drugs.16 Furthermore, they have been responsible for giving rise
to promiscuity in vitro, off-target pharmacology assays and toxicity
alerts.10 Interestingly, aggregates have
also been associated with beneficial attributes such as enhancing
exceptional drug oral bioavailability.17 One can also envisage drug nano-entities as potential drug carriers
or even delivery systems.

Here, we use several anticancer drugs
(Sorafenib, Lapatinib, Gefitinib,
and Fulvestrant) and an anti-leprosy drug (Clofazimine) as model systems
to explore various techniques for monitoring their physicochemical
solution behavior. We evaluate data from NMR, DLS, TEM, and CLSM to
characterize the nano-entities formed and to probe the strengths and
limitations of the methods. It should be kept in mind that the present
study focuses on compounds that form the large colloidal aggregates.
Studies involving the smaller nano-forms are referred to an early
report and to forthcoming disclosures.10,12

Result and Discussion
A typical workflow practiced in the pharmaceutical industry is
one where medicinal chemists synthesize new compounds based on design
concepts intended to capture a range of intended favorable properties,
for example, binding and specificity for a target protein, bioavailability,
stability, and safety.

Medicinal chemists almost exclusively
characterize their candidate
drugs in organic solvents, then lyophilize, and expedite the powders
or stock solutions to multiple other laboratories for a broad range
of pharmaceutical tests where the compounds are dissolved in or diluted
with aqueous media. However, drugs behave much differently in organic
solvents as compared to aqueous media, and thus the above workflow
introduces an important and uncharacterized disconnect. That is, no
one along the workflow is responsible for monitoring a compound’s
aqueous behavior in solution for the aggregate phase—thus,
the three-phase equilibrium systematically goes largely unexplored.

This is unfortunate because a simple and quick perusal of the 1H NMR spectrum of a compound in buffer can easily begin to
expose features of its three-state equilibrium.12 This is illustrated in (Figure 1) for the four compounds (Sorafenib, Lapatinib,
Clofazimine, and Gefitinib). From 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO-d6, compounds were diluted in DMSO-d6 solvent to 200 μM concentration where it was noted
that they dissolved well—clear solutions were observed with
no precipitate. 1H NMR spectra of the later samples (200
μM) were then acquired, respectively, and shown in Figure 1a. This atomic view
of hydrogen nuclei shows that all resonances are observable and sharp,
as expected for compounds that behave as single lone-tumbling molecules
in solution.

Figure 1 NMR spectra of four compounds. (a) Compounds in DMSO-d6 at 200 μM, (b) compounds in buffer at
200 μM,
(c) compounds in the presence of Tween 80, (d) DLS data for the four
compounds. Both techniques involving buffer contained 50 mM sodium
phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 10% D2O, pH 7.4 in the absence
and presence of 0.025% (v/v) Tween 80 for 24 h.

Samples of these compounds at 200 μM in aqueous buffer
were
then prepared by placing aliquots of DMSO-d6 stock solutions into aqueous buffer followed by gentle agitation.
Some cloudiness or solid precipitate was noted, and so the samples
were subjected to light centrifugation. The supernatant was then placed
in NMR tubes and 1H NMR spectra acquired. Figure 1b shows that no NMR resonances
were observed. It is possible that the compounds totally existed as
a solid-state form and were removed by this latter manipulation. Even
if some solid remained as a cloudiness, the resonances of solids are
too broad to be observed by solution NMR. Another possible explanation
would be that the compounds partitioned between precipitates and very
large self-associated and soluble aggregates. The latter would have
to tumble too slowly in solution which would also result in resonances
that are too broad to be observed by solution NMR. Interestingly,
we showed in a previous report that a simple trick of adding a detergent
such as Triton or Tween to the samples induced the breakup of the
large aggregates, resulting in faster tumbling lone molecules, which
then gave rise to observable NMR resonances. To our surprise, the
addition of detergent to the Sorafenib sample did not give rise to
sharp resonances (see Figure 1c), whereas sharp resonances did arise for Lapatinib, Clofazimine,
and Gefitinib (see Figure 1c). The latter observations unequivocally report the existence
of the large aggregates. However, the lack of resonances for Sorafenib
demonstrates our assumptions and limited knowledge of aggregate types
and how to manipulate and observe them by NMR.

Interestingly,
DLS data acquired on the aqueous samples, after
light centrifugation, clearly showed existence of the nanometer-sized
aggregates (see Figure 1d). The DLS data of these samples after the subsequent addition of
detergent report differential changes in aggregate sizes, which demonstrated
the potential complementarity of NMR and DLS techniques. TEM also
convincingly revealed the presence of very large aggregates in various
media such as Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (see Figure 2a), cell culture media (DMEM) without (FBS)
(see Figure 2b), and
aqueous phosphate buffer (see Figure 2c). Similar experiments and conditions were also reported
by others in which they found that the behaviors of the three anticancer
drugs Lapatinib, Fulvestrant, and Sorafenib are consistent with the
formation of colloidal aggregates in phosphate buffer and in cell
culture media 10% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C.15

and Gefitinib), and an antileprosy drug (Clofazimine), (a) 50 μM
of compounds incubated for 24 h in DMEM 5% FBS, or (b) in DMEM with
no FBS, or (c) in phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Bars represent 100 nm.

First, it must be kept in mind
that our samples were prepared by
soaking the compound solutions with a carbon-coated copper grid which
is required for TEM observation purposes. Also, it is expected that
lone-tumbling single molecules (tumbling radius on the single digit
Ångstrom scale) would be invisible by TEM which is sensitive
to species that have radii on the double-digit nanometer scale. Keeping
these considerations in mind, a number of observations can nonetheless
be made for characterizing these intriguing and large nano-entities
observed (see Figure 2).

Interestingly, a comparison of the horizontal images along
(Figure 2c) shows a
variety
of large aggregates for the drugs in buffer. Some are smaller such
as that found for Clofazimine, whereas very large globs are noted
for Fulvestrant, Sorafenib, and Lapatinib. A range of sizes are also
noted. Gefitinib appears as a solid-like form. Changes in the aggregates
are notable when the compounds are soaked in DMEM media—compare Figure 2a with 2b. Likewise, dramatic changes are observed when comparing
all three media conditions (see Figure 2a–c). We then studied the effect of adding detergent
to large nano-entities. The addition of detergents to samples suspected
of forming large aggregates is a widely used strategy in many biochemical
assays to reveal false-positive hits in screening campaigns.

One typically runs screening campaigns to identify lone-tumbling
compounds that inhibit a protein, but these assays are frequently
contaminated with false-positive hits from compounds which form large
aggregates and inhibit via nonstoichiometry and nonspecific means.
Running follow-up validation screens typically involves the addition
of a detergent, which presumably breaks up drug aggregates, and results
in the loss of false-positive inhibition.

We thus explored the
effect of the addition of detergents on the
aggregates of the drugs studied here (see Figure 3a). The TEM images shown in Figure 3a for Sorafenib, Lapatinib,
and Clofazimine (in the absence of detergent) clearly display large
aggregates. Upon addition of 0.025% Tween 80 detergent, the TEM images
in Figure 3b show that
these large aggregates have been seriously altered and disrupted.
Taking the 1H NMR experiments in Figure 1 into account, it is clear that addition
of detergent breaks the aggregates into very small tumbling entities
for Lapatinib and Clofazimine, which is consistent with the TEM changes
in Figure 3b. However,
small entities were not observed for Sorafenib upon addition of detergent,
whereas the TEM data clearly shows disruption of the large aggregates.
Therefore, the example of Sorafenib demonstrates that solubility is
limited, or more likely here, there might be aggregate types that
NMR and TEM simply cannot detect. This suggests that each compound
can assume its unique fingerprint of self-assemblies, thus one must
remain vigilant regarding assumptions and dogma in this field of study.

Bar represent 100 nm.

Two notable and contentious assumptions are that compound
aggregates
cannot exist in plasma nor be able to cross membranes to enter cells.18 The former assumption has often been rationalized,
given that many drugs have been found to be highly serum-bound in
vivo.19 Given this, the majority of a compound
would be expected to be bound to serum proteins such as albumin, leaving
compounds mostly unavailable to self-associate. This assumption is
unfounded. In a previous study, involving an NMR aggregation test,
it was clearly shown that aggregating compounds remained self-associated
in a range of pharmacology buffers, plasma, and blood. This would
suggest that there is a significant affinity for self-association
for some compounds.10 It has also recently
been reported that Evans Blue forms colloids that adsorb albumin.15

Regarding these assumptions, we set out
here to identify tools
that can help determine if aggregating compounds can cross membranes
and enter cells. Others assumed that aggregates are too large and
cannot diffuse through cell membrane of live cells.16 For our study, we explored the use of CLSM. First, one
must realize and consider that all the methods used here make observations
at very distinct resolutions. NMR makes measurements at the atomic
level or Ångstroms, whereas TEM and DLS resolve particles at
the nanometer scale, and CLSM at the micrometer level. Thus, CLSM
is the most appropriate method for observations at the cellular level.
However, to render a compound observable by CLSM, it must have inherent
fluorescence, so we were limited in the compounds that could be studied—thus,
potential compounds were prescreened by a standard fluorescent microscope.

We began this study by the incubation of HeLa cells in the presence
of Lapatinib at 50 μM for 24 h and acquired CLSM views (see Figure 4a). Data from a range
of other concentrations, conditions, and compounds are provided in
the Supporting Information, along with
a description of the procedures employed and experimental information. Figure 4a shows that the
green fluorescent of Lapatinib indeed had entered the cell and appears
mostly localized to the cytoplasm. Note that the cell membrane and
nuclei can be visualized (see Figure 4a) based on the red and blue dyes Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate
of WGA and DRAQ5, respectively, which are well-known markers. Interestingly,
Lapatinib appears to be well-distributed within the cytoplasm given
that green fluorescence is observed for all the cytoplasm.

Figure 4 (a) Confocal
images of HeLa cells incubated in the presence of
50 μM Lapatinib for 24 h. Alexa fluor WGA 555 was used to stain
cell membranes and DRAQ5 to stain the nucleus. (b) Huh-7 cells incubated
in the presence of 50 μM Clofazimine for 24 h. DAPI was used
to stain the nucleus. Bar represents 20 and 10 μm.

We also measured the antiproliferative activities
of aggregate
form (no Tween) and monomer forms (+Tween) of Lapatinib on HeLa cells.
Our study found that both forms exhibit similar antiproliferative
activities suggesting that both forms are capable of entering HeLa
cells (see Supporting Information, Figure
S6). Note that we and others confirmed that 0.025% of Tween 80 was
nontoxic (Supporting Information).15 In contrast, others found that the monomer form
had significantly improved activity versus the aggregate form using
MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that the monomer form has better capability
of entering cells as compared to the aggregate from. Thus, aggregate
penetration is likely cell type-dependent.

Further CLSM studies
were then focused on another compound Clofazimine,
and distinct findings were observed. Clofazimine was incubated with
Huh-7 cells for 1 hour (see Figure 4b). Although Figure 4b shows a well-distributed green fluorescence within
the cytoplasm, there are stronger compound signals arising from the
nucleus. Note that the nuclei can be visualized (see Figure 4b) based on the blue dye DAPI,
but the cell membrane cannot be easily distinguishable given that
no Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate of WGA dye was added in this experiment
because of signal interferences. In order to verify that the compound
aggregates were occurring intra- and not extra-cellularly, care was
taken to wash the cells after the incubation step. They were washed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any existing extracellular
aggregates, and fresh DMEM 5% FBS were added to the cells.20

It is also interesting that Clofazimine
is considered as a lipophilic
antibiotic which has very long pharmacokinetic half-life of up to
70 days.20 It was noted that Clofazimine
aggregates/accumulates in cells (in vitro) over several days, where
it formed intracellular inclusions in the cytoplasm. Perhaps the long
half-life is related to sequestering via aggregation. It was also
reported that Clofazimine can be toxic as it induces changes to the
mitochondria structure and function. Also, Clofazimine has reported
to form stable complexes with DNA and transfer RNA, which resulted
in spectral red shifts.21 In our study,
no red shifts were observed and detections were made using the same
green emission wavelengths in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Our
study also employed ultrathin section electron microscopy (USEM)
to observe aggregates within cells but as a complementary technique
with higher resolution at the nanometer scale. Figure 5 shows USEM images involving Clofazimine,
Lapatinib, and Light green SF yellowish to probe these compounds in
cells. Interestingly, distinct dark inclusions were noted in the presence
of compounds. These inclusions appeared to resemble the size, number,
and distribution to the drug inclusions observed by transmission light
microscopy.

μM Light green SF yellowish, (d) represents control cells in
the absence of drugs. Bar represent 500 nm.

Conclusions
This work begins the process of evaluating tools
for detecting
large nano-entities. We found some strengths and weaknesses of a set
of techniques, which nonetheless together have allowed us to reveal
features of nano-entities from the atomic level to the micrometer
scale. It was noted that these large nano-entities can adopt a variety
of sizes and types that highly depend on the solution conditions.
It was also confirmed that compounds that form nano-entities can indeed
enter cells, and will certainly have properties (e.g., see ref (20)).

However, it is
still unclear where nano-entities can enter cells
as the monomer form versus aggregate form. Perhaps this is cell and
aggregate dependent. Others suggest that colloids do not,15,16 whereas we observe compounds that have colloidal forms and can enter
cells. The exact mechanism of entry remains unknown.

Another
important point is whether the compounds exist in cells
as self-associated aggregates or subcellular localized with organelles.
Perhaps both occur. The self-association into aggregates certainly
helps to augment the observed fluorescence signal (see Figures 4 and S1–S5) as compared to a fluorescent compound Tartrazine that behave as
lone-tumbling molecules and have low signal-to-noise (Figure S7). Certainly, colocalization also occurs. Figure S1 suggests that Lapatinib can colocalize
with lysosomes. To better address the question of intracellular self-association,
further studies are warranted involving the lack and addition of tween.
Unfortunately, the toxicity of some compound studies here impeded
such experiments.

It is our assessment that the scientific community
has only begun
to reveal this fascinating drug nano-world. First, a platform of techniques
needs to be established, which will allow the scientific community
to characterize nano-entities then establish their correlation with
salient properties. For example, it has already been established that
large-nano-entities can be correlated with compounds high bioavailability,
promiscuity, false-positives in screens, and so forth. Perhaps a better
understanding of nano-entities can help minimize drug side effects,
promote safer compounds to the clinic, or to serve as drug delivery
systems. For example, the corresponding author has used the detection
of aggregates to deprioritize promiscuous drug candidates and promote
selective compounds for the clinic.12,22,23

Experimental Section
Compounds (Drugs and Dyes)
Drugs and dyes used in this
study were obtained from commercial vendors. CAS numbers are as following:
Sorafenib (284461-73-0) from Synchem, Inc.; Fulvestrant (129453-61-8)
from Sigma; Lapatinib (388082-78-8) from Larid Road; Clofazimine (2030-63-9)
from Sigma; Tartrazine (1934-21-0), and Light green SF yellowish (5141-20-8)
from Alfa Aesar. Alexa fluor WGA555 and Prolong Diamond Anti-fade
with DAPI was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Compounds were diluted
in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and in DMEM 5% FBS. Next, 100 μL
of the samples were transferred into a 240 μL Airfuge tube.
A carbon-coated copper grid was inserted into the bottom of the Airfuge
tube with fine tweezers and centrifuged for 5 min at 20 psi. The carbon
grid was gently removed with tweezers and washed with distilled water,
and the carbon grid was negatively stained with 3% of phosphotungstic
acid (PTA-3). The grid was removed, blotted, and dried with a bibulous
paper, then examined by transmission electron microscope (Hitachi
H-7100). The photographs were processed with the digital camera AMT
version 600.147.

Cell Culture
HeLa and Huh-7 cell
lines were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 5% of FBS albumin and in 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
CLSM was employed
to observe the self-aggregation of compounds within the cells. HeLa
and Huh-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24 well plates and
cultured overnight in DMEM (5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at
37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell culture media was removed and
washed twice with PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride).
Compounds at the given concentrations were added to the wells. After
1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed twice with
1× PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride) and treated
with Alexa Fluor WGA555 for membrane staining. The cells were then
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 minutes and washed twice
with PBS 1×. Further, the coverslips were mounted on a prolong
diamond antifade with DAPI nucleus staining for Clofazimine and Light
green SF yellowish and DRAQ-5 for Lapatinib. The cells were imaged
by a Zeiss CLSM-780 confocal microscopy (ZEISS, Jena, Germany) on
an Olympus FV1000 at 60× magnification, using the excitation
and emission wavelengths for DAPI, excitation was at 405 nm and emission
at 460 nm; for Alexa Fluor WGA555, excitation and emission were at
520 and 550 nm, respectively. Compound excitation and emission information
are as follows: Clofazimine excitation (460–495 nm) and emission
(515–550 nm), Lapatinib excitation (405 nm) and emission 460
nm), and Light green SF yellowish excitation (405 nm) and emission
(460 nm).

Cell Proliferation Assay and in Vitro Cytotoxicity Study (MTT
Assay)
The cytotoxicity of the panel of compounds and DMSO
were evaluated in vitro using MTT assays. HeLa and Huh-7 cells were
plated in 96-well plates and cultured overnight in DMEM 5% FBS, in
the absence or presence of compounds. After removing the culture medium,
various concentrations of the compounds added to the cells, and incubated
for 24 h. The medium in each well was then aspirated and discarded.
Next, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide), was added to each well and incubated for 2 to
4 h. Following incubation, the medium was replaced with 150 μL
DMSO solution. After 15 min, the optical densities at 570 nm were
measured by spectrophotometer.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Compounds were measured in
DMEM 5% FBS or phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Measurements were performed
by polystyrol/polystyrene 10 × 10 × 45 mm cuvettes, utilizing
the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern), version 1.7, with a 60 mW laser operating
at 830 nm and a detector angle of 158°. All samples were centrifuged
before analysis performed in triplicate at 25 °C and the data
were acquired using the Dynamics software. Compounds were at 50 μM.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Compounds were prepared
from 20 mM DMSO stock solutions into buffer consisting of 50 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.4 and 10% D2O. DMSO samples were prepared
by diluting the stock samples. NMR data was acquired on a Bruker 600
MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a helium cryoprobe.10,12

Thin-Section Electron Microscopy
The cells were plated
at 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated in the presence
of 50 μM of all compounds for 24 h. The medium was then aspirated,
and the cells washed two times with 1× PBS. The cells were then
fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5% in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer or phosphate-buffered
saline, overnight) and again washed 2× with PBS. Next, the cells
were collected and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min.
The fixed-cell pellets were resuspended in a freshly prepared solution
1.3% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in a colliding buffer for 1–2 h
and then dehydrated by successive washes with 25, 50, 75, and 95%
solutions of acetone in water (15–30 min each). This was followed
by two changes of pure acetone incubated for 30 min each. The cell
pellets were then resuspended in SPURR acetone (1:1) and incubated
for 16–18 h at room temperature. The cells were cut into small
pieces and placed in BEEM capsules to capacity. The capsules were
incubated at 600–650 °C for the polymerization reaction
to occur. The final stage involved cutting the embedded cells into
ultrathin sections and placing the sections on a carbon-covered copper
200-mesh grid. The grids were then stained with 50% ethanol for 20–25
min. Examination of the sections was performed using an electron microscope
(Hitachi H-7100), and the photographs were processed using the digital
camera AMT, version 600.147.
