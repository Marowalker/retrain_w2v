The
stability, reusability, and monitoring of enzyme activity have
been investigated to improve their efficiency for successful utilization
in a broad range of industrial and medical applications. Herein, we
present a simple method for fabricating an electrospun fiber/enzyme
scaffold via co-electrospinning. The characterization of soluble and
immobilized α-amylases with regard to pH, thermal stability,
and reusability were studied. An organic light emitting material tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum
was incorporated to monitor the enzyme activity for several reuses.

Introduction
The tremendous potential
of enzymes as green versatile biocatalysts
has been previously reported.1 Enzymes
consist of a complex three-dimensional structure of proteins with
a high degree of specificity. This specificity, as well as the capability,
energy efficiency, and cost-effective properties of enzymes, allow
them to perform as catalysts.2 This function
results in their use in a wide range of applications including pharmaceutical
synthesis, biosensing, food processing, and bioremediation.3,4 However, biocatalysts that are composed of free enzymes may exhibit
structural changes because of processing conditions, such as pH, temperature,
chemical agents, and ionic strength.5−7 These process variables
can limit the activity, stability, and reusability of the enzymes.

To overcome these deficiencies, various methodologies have been
employed to improve biocatalyst functionality, stability, and reusability.8 Enzyme immobilization has emerged as a promising
and viable method for achieving better performance with little or
no limitations.9 The results of immobilization
primarily depend on the composition, structure, and type of immobilizing
substrates.10 Different nanomaterials have
been used as substrates, including porous silica, nanotubes, and magnetite
nanoparticles.11,12 These nanostructures tend to
be good supports because of their high aspect ratio. These characteristic
features of nanomaterials will result in efficient immobilization.
However, some of these nanostructures are hampered by their morphology,
which affects the enzymatic process. For example, enzyme that was
immobilized on porous silica reduced its internal surface, which affected
the diffusion of the enzymatic reaction and resulted in lower enzyme
activity. In addition, the dispersion and reusability of nanoparticles
and nanotubes can be difficult, which adversely affects their use
as immobilizing substrates.10

In
recent years, the use of the electrospinning technique has received
considerable attention for fabricating nanofibers with well-defined
lengths, diameters, and compositions.12 These predesigned nanofibers would ensure their applications in
various fields, such as reinforcement,13 filtration,14,15 biomedical, and pharmaceutical
applications16 as well as electronic and
optical devices.17,18 In biocatalysis, electrospun
nanofibers have attracted considerable interest because of its distinctive
characteristics and superiority in many aspects. The advantages of
this method include the multiple points of attachment to the electrospun
fiber support, which can restrict undesirable conformational changes
in the biocatalytic enzymes. Enzyme immobilization on electrospun
fibers can promote and maintain the natural catalytic activity and
allow enzyme separation from the reaction medium for recycling.19

Several studies have reported different
approaches for immobilizing
enzymes on electrospun nanofibers. These approaches include the enzyme
binding onto the surface of nanofibers as well as nanofiber–enzyme
encapsulation.11,20 Covalent binding of an enzyme
with nanofibers requires fabricating nanofibers that contain reactive
groups. However, the resulting immobilized enzyme exhibits a reduced
enzyme activity over time. This phenomenon may be due to the interaction
between the immobilized enzyme and the supporting materials.21 In addition, the covalent attachment of enzymes
onto nanofibers results in the formation of a monolayer on the fiber
surface, which limits enzyme loading.22

In contrast, the co-electrospinning method offers an easy
route
for the formation of enzyme encapsulation into nanofibers with good
efficiency.23 However, several concerns
regarding this method remain (e.g., the aqueous solubility of the
supporting materials, conformational change of the enzymes due to
applied voltage, and organic solvent effects24,25).

In this study, the α-amylase enzyme encapsulation
approach
via co-electrospinning was applied, and an organic light emitting
material (Alq3) was incorporated during the electrospinning process Figure 1. This method enables
low enzyme loading, high enzyme activity, and reusability. Alq3 fluorescence
was used to monitor the enzyme activity for several cycles.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a schematic representation of the initial preparation process for
the enzyme and Alq3 scaffold substrate. 1 wt % of the α-amylase
powder was mixed with Carbothane polymer in ethanol. 1 wt % of the
Alq3 powder was dispersed in ethanol using ultrasonic irradiation.
The two solutions were mixed to prepare a homogenous mixture prior
to electrospinning. The final solution was placed in a 5 mL syringe.
An electrical field of 19.5 kV over a distance of 15 cm was applied.
The flow rate of the copolymer composite was set to 0.9 mL/h. The
composite was electrospun for 3 h to achieve a thickness of approximately
450–500 μm. The electrospun sheet was dried under the
electrospinning system fan (NANON, MECC, Japan) overnight to remove
any remaining solvent prior to use. The as-prepared scaffold was irradiated
with a UV lamp in dark environment to demonstrate the presence of
Alq3. Figure 1b shows
a detailed morphological view of the fabricated scaffold using a field
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JEOL-7600F). As shown
in Figure 1b(i), the
pure Carbothane fibers have a high surface area with a clear morphology
and a semiuniform size. In comparison to Figure 1b(i), the surface of the produced fibers
gradually changed from smooth and clear to rough because of the encapsulation
of α-amylase as shown in Figure 1b(ii). After the addition of Alq3, the fiber surface
became rougher with a slightly large diameter and no beads, as shown
in Figure 1b(iii).

The activity of α-amylase was determined spectrophotometrically
at 560 nm by measuring the released maltose from starch according
to the Miller method (1959) with a slight modification. A mixture,
which consisted of 125 μL of 2% soluble starch, 125 μL
of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5), an appropriate amount of
enzyme solution, and distilled water to achieve 0.5 mL volume in the
tubes was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition
of 0.5 mL of the dinitrosalicylic acid reagent to terminate the reaction.
The immobilized enzyme was removed from the reaction mixture and washed
with distilled water. Next, the reaction mixture was incubated in
a boiling water bath for 10 min and cooled. Then, the absorption was
measured. The reusability of the immobilized enzyme and the enzyme
activity were evaluated after repeated enzyme assaying and washing
with water to remove the substrate and products. As shown in Figure 2, the immobilized
enzyme demonstrated 30% of its initial activity after 10 cycles, indicating
that the immobilized α-amylase has suitable stability and can
be reused. Similar enzyme reusability results have been reported in
previous studies.26,27 It is important to note that
the applied electrical current (19 kV) had no effect on the catalytic
activity of α-amylase enzyme. Moreover, a similar study reported
that a direct electric current exhibited less effect on the laccase
enzyme, and the laccase and electric field exhibited a better response
to practical environment changes.28

Figure 2 Determination
of α-amylase activity and reusability.

Figure 3a
shows
the recorded photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of Alq3 after
nine cycles in the reusability experiments. A confocal microscope
(Carl-Zeiss LSM 780) was used for this experiment. Organometallic
derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline, such as Alq3, are highly fluorescent
materials due to the metal ion, which changes the energy levels and
causes charge transfer from the metal ion to the aromatic rings.29 Therefore, any changes in the order of Alq3
and/or its interaction with surrounding molecules may increase the
nonradiative process with PL quenching. The Alq3 peak position was
observed at approximately 519 nm in all recorded samples.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic
representation of the fabrication process. (b) FESEM
images of (i) pristine Carbothane, (ii) Carbothane/enzyme blend, and
(iii) Carbothane/enzyme/Alq3.

The emission spectrum of Alq3 results from its 8-hydroxyquinoline
ligands.30 The position of this peak is
close to that previously reported.31,32 The corresponding
PL emission intensity of Alq3 quenches after repeating the enzyme
reactions. The PL emission spectrum of Alq3 in the absence of the
enzyme was compared with the current experiment. In this case, the
PL emission of Alq3 was nearly stable with minor fluctuations during
all repeated measurements. Because the pH of the experiment was adjusted
at 6.5, the quenching of Alq3 may be attributed to the hydrolyzed
reaction products (glucose and maltose) that were produced during
the enzymatic process. Glucose and/or maltose may penetrate the scaffold
and become adhered to the Alq3 particles causing disorder and changes
the energy levels. To confirm this hypothesis, the prepared scaffold
was individually placed in two different solutions (glucose and maltose).
As expected, the Alq3 PL was quenched, indicating the effect of the
reaction products in the quenching process (see Supporting Information Figure S1). Panel (b) shows different
confocal images of the scaffold after each measurement. As shown in
the images, the PL emission intensity of Alq3 was gradually quenched
after each reusability experiment. Panel (c) shows a plot of the relationship
between the Alq3 PL emission and the number of repeated enzyme experiments.
The Alq3 PL retains 70% of its PL intensity after the first reaction
experiment. The Alq3 PL intensity gradually decreased based on the
number of enzyme reusability experiments.

Figure 4 shows assessments
of the pH effect on the free and immobilized enzyme range from 4.0
to 9.0. The pH of free and immobilized α-amylase was shifted
from 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. In the immobilized sample, the α-amylase
enzyme by virtue of its functional groups could be physically bonded
within the scaffold through multiple connections.33 These bonds created between α-amylase enzyme and
the scaffold lead to different environmental changes in response to
the effect of pH compared with the free enzyme.34

represents the average of two experiments.

Figure 5 illustrates
the effect of temperature ranges from 30 to 80 °C for the free
and immobilized enzymes. The optimum temperature for the free and
immobilized α-amylase was 40 and 50 °C, respectively. The
free α-amylase enzyme exhibited around 40% of the activity,
whereas immobilized α-amylase retained 60% of the activity at
70 °C. Results having the similar changes with optimum temperature
changes were reported in previous studies.35

Each point represents the average of two experiments.

Our results highlight the potential of using the
co-electrospinning
approach as a feasible method for enzyme immobilization. This method
appears to preserve the enzyme activity. Alq3, which is a molecular
organic semiconductor that was incorporated inside the polymer scaffold,
is capable of recognizing biochemical interactions. The PL intensity
was quenched as the product concentration produced by the enzyme-catalyzed
reaction increased. This study signifies a new approach for preparing
organic light emitting materials for unprecedented biochemical sensing
applications.
