A comprehensive
molecular analysis of a simple aqueous complexing
system—U(VI) acetate—selected to be independently investigated
by various spectroscopic (vibrational, luminescence, X-ray absorption,
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and quantum chemical
methods was achieved by an international round-robin test (RRT). Twenty
laboratories from six different countries with a focus on actinide
or geochemical research participated and contributed to this scientific
endeavor. The outcomes of this RRT were considered on two levels of
complexity: first, within each technical discipline, conformities
as well as discrepancies of the results and their sources were evaluated.
The raw data from the different experimental approaches were found
to be generally consistent. In particular, for complex setups such
as accelerator-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the agreement
between the raw data was high. By contrast, luminescence spectroscopic
data turned out to be strongly related to the chosen acquisition parameters.
Second, the potentials and limitations of coupling various spectroscopic
and theoretical approaches for the comprehensive study of actinide
molecular complexes were assessed. Previous spectroscopic data from
the literature were revised and the benchmark data on the U(VI) acetate
system provided an unambiguous molecular interpretation based on the
correlation of spectroscopic and theoretical results. The multimethodologic
approach and the conclusions drawn address not only important aspects
of actinide spectroscopy but particularly general aspects of modern
molecular analytical chemistry.

1 Introduction
Exploring the migration pathways of contaminants in the ecosphere
is a major field in the environmental sciences. In the past few decades,
particular attention was paid to the migration behavior of radioactive
heavy metals because of their chemo- and radiotoxicity in humans.1 The dispersion of these elements in soils and
rocks is mainly governed by their chemical speciation in the pore
water and accordingly by the chemical reactions occurring at mineral–liquid
interfaces.2,3 Among the radionuclides, the high abundance
of uranium (U) at sites considered for remediation activities and
its relevance to the long-term safety assessment of nuclear waste
repositories have led to numerous studies on the hydrolysis reactions
of the hexavalent, highly soluble uranyl cation UO22+ and its complexing reactions with ubiquitous inorganic and
organic ligands.4−7 Additionally, waste forms from other parts of the nuclear fuel cycle
are of concern such as remedies of the uranium mining, milling, and
enrichment industries, or uranium from other industrial processes,
for example geothermal energy generation or phosphate fertilizer production.8

Previously, the thermodynamic data of such
complex species were
primarily derived from macroscopic approaches, such as potentiometric
and extraction experiments.6 However, the
assignment of species to distinct molecular complexes with empirical
formulas was mainly accomplished without structural information. In
fact, the existence of most of the postulated species and their contributions
to the multifaceted aqueous chemistry of the UO22+ ion still await unequivocal evidence from spectroscopic or theoretical
approaches. In recent years, progress in the advancement not only
of spectroscopic techniques but also of quantum chemical (QC) approaches
has provided an increasing amount of spectral data related to the
aqueous speciation of U(VI). However, the state of knowledge still
appears partially contradictory and unclear.9−12

The idea of a multimethodological
round-robin test (RRT) on the
aqueous speciation of an actinide system was born in the aftermath
of the closing round table discussion at the first Workshop on Advanced
Techniques in Actinide Spectroscopy (ATAS) held in November 2012 at
Dresden, Germany. During this discussion, scientists working in experimental
or theoretical disciplines of actinide research shared their perspectives
on the contributions from the other discipline and their expectations
associated therewith. It became obvious that the current knowledge
is inconsistent because of the multitudinous data provided by various
spectroscopic and theoretical approaches, the meaning and interpretability
of which are often hard to convey to the highly specialized scientists
in different disciplines. Hence, this interdisciplinary test on a
relatively simple actinide complex system was intended to elucidate
the collection of knowledge from data acquisition to the resulting
interpretational approaches. Consistencies and discrepancies in the
results and in the way of best practice obtained by each single spectroscopic
or theoretical technique applied in various laboratories and their
sources should be disclosed to elaborate the potentials and limitations
of each single technique. Furthermore, the benefit of multimethodical
approaches for the molecular study of a selected complex system was
to be assessed (cf. Figure S1).

The
selection of the chemical system to be investigated and of
the analytical techniques to be applied by the participants was mainly
based on experience within the actinide geochemistry community as
well as the feasibility of performing experiments encompassing the
broad array of techniques available in leading laboratories in the
field of geochemical sciences. After extensive discussions between
potential participants, the aqueous U(VI) acetate system appeared
to be the most implementable system in terms of experimental effort,
radiation safety, sample preparation, and applicability to sophisticated
spectroscopic techniques, namely, vibrational, luminescence, X-ray
absorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For
several reasons (e.g., organizational aspects, few number of participants,
etc.), techniques, such as UV–vis absorption spectroscopy or
mass spectrometry that may also provide high information value on
species distribution, were not considered.

The U(VI) acetate
system has been examined since the 1950s. Mainly
thermodynamic data on the complexing species and recently structural
information by the application of spectroscopy and quantum chemistry
have been derived. Up to now, the presence of four species for this
complexing system is discussed in the acidic pH range (pH ≤
4): UO2(H2O)52+, UO2CH3COO+, UO2(CH3COO)2, and UO2(CH3COO)3–, denoted below as the (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), and
(1,3) species, respectively (cf. Figure S2).13 A more recent study takes fewer species
into account.14 Because of the formation
of insoluble hydrolyzed U(VI) solid phases, for example, schoepite,
the pH range considered in this RRT was restricted to a maximum value
of 3.5. The details of the RRT organization are provided in the following
section and in the Supporting Information (Sections S1–S4).

More than 40 scientists from 20 institutions
joined the RRT. According
to the technique applied, the results were initially collected by
nominated scientists acting as cluster speakers for a single technique
applied in several laboratories. During a special session of the second
ATAS workshop held in November 2014, preliminary summary reports were
presented and discussed extensively. This work represents the outcome
of this RRT. First, a survey of the experimental and theoretical data
obtained is given for each technique. Second, the results are combined
into a discussion focusing on the consequences for the knowledge on
the U(VI) acetate speciation. Finally, general conclusions and perspectives
of the RRT are provided. We believe that the methodology as well as
the outcome of this RRT appeals to a broad community of inorganic
chemists, actinide chemists, analytical chemists, geochemists, and
environmental engineers.

2 Organization of the RRT
The RRT was initiated in late 2013 at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden−Rossendorf
(HZDR). After the approval of the participating institutions, five
clusters were formed according to the spectroscopic and theoretical
techniques, namely, vibrational spectroscopy (VIB, five institutions),
laser-induced luminescence spectroscopy (LUM, nine institutions),
NMR spectroscopy (five institutions), X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS, three laboratories located at three different European synchrotron
sources), and QC calculations (QCC, six institutions) (cf. Figure S1). An overview of the clusters and the
respective participating institutions is given in Table S1. For each cluster, a representative speaker was nominated.

For each analytical method, participants received four samples,
denoted U1–U4, and respective reference samples, denoted B1–B4
(see Table S2). Those samples were uniformly
prepared at HZDR. The participants received detailed information on
sample preparation as it is given in the Supporting Information (Section S3). Apart from the requirement of measuring
the samples as received, no further restrictions or guidelines were
given to the participants to avoid significant impact on the specific
approaches of the participants. The performance of the measurements
and analysis of the raw data (e.g., data transformations, background
subtraction, smoothing, deconvolution, etc.), as well as data interpretation,
were entirely at the responsibility of each single operator or operating
team. The Supporting Information (Section
S4) provides detailed information on each cluster, describes experimental
procedures, and lists all relevant setting parameters of the participants
for each analytical method and quantum chemistry.

The period
for active participation was from January to August
2014. Each participant submitted the raw data obtained, a detailed
description of settings, the data analysis procedures applied, and
the interpretational approaches of the derived molecular structures
to the respective cluster speaker who in turn provided a summary report
of the cluster to the organizers of the RRT.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Results from the Clusters
All clusters
delivered substantial data sets for intercomparison to determine consistencies
and discrepancies within the applied analytical methods. For the sake
of brevity, only a summary of the most important aspects can be given
here. But, a description and interpretation of the whole data and
its discussion with up-to-date literature as well as of different
interpretative approaches of the participants are given in detail
in the Supporting Information (Section
S5). Furthermore, the original data from each participant are given
in Section S6.

3.1.1 Vibrational
Spectroscopy
All vibrational
spectra of the samples U1–U4 obtained by IR and Raman spectroscopy
are shown in Figure 1. The focus is set on the spectral region of the asymmetric (ν3(UO2)) and symmetric (ν1(UO2)) stretching modes for clarity (Figure 1A,B). All other features observed in the
spectra of the different samples mainly reflect the modes of the acetate
molecule, which do not show a change in frequency but in intensity
(Figures S9 and S10). The spectra provided
by the single contributors are given in different colors. A detailed
description of the spectroscopic features and their interpretation
is given in the Supporting Information (Section
S5.1).

Figure 1 Vibrational spectra of samples U1–U4. Different colors correspond
to different participants. Only the spectral regions of the ν3(UO2) mode from IR (A) and of the ν1(UO2) mode from Raman spectroscopy (B) are shown. Values
are given in cm–1.

The vibrational spectroscopic data of this RRT provided by
five
independent participants are in excellent agreement for all samples
(cf. Table S8). For IR spectroscopy, the
interpretation of IR data by all participants is consistent, and four
different species could be spectrally identified. Generally, all species
found in the IR spectra should be intrinsically observed in the Raman
spectra as well. However, Raman spectra of the U(VI) acetate complexes
are more difficult to interpret because of the strongly interfering
bands of the symmetric stretching mode ν1(UO2) of the different species and a vibrational mode of the acetate
ligand. Consequently, the results of this cluster demonstrate that
IR and Raman spectroscopy are strongly complementary techniques for
the aqueous speciation of actinyl complexes.

3.1.2 Luminescence
Spectroscopy
A survey
of the time-resolved emission spectra revealed significantly different
sets of acquisition parameters, resulting in a large time gate that
ranged from a few nanoseconds to 100 ms (Figure 2A). Beside the gate width, parameters such
as the initial time delay and the number and size of the gate steps
strongly varied between the data sets provided by the participants
(cf. Table S5 in the Supporting Information). However, general analysis of the time-resolved spectra from each
participant suggested multi-exponential decay behavior, indicating
the presence of at least two distinct species showing characteristic
peak positions and luminescence lifetimes regardless of the variation
in the spectral parameter applied (cf. Figures S11–S19 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 Time regimes applied
by all participants of the LUM cluster during
the acquisition of the luminescence spectra (A). Emission spectra
of sample U1 as measured (B) and after calibration (C) using the peak
maximum at 490 nm as an internal standard. Only spectra of four participants
could be used for calibration (for details, see Supporting Information 5.2).

For a detailed analysis of the spectral data, the reader
is referred
to the Supporting Information. In summary,
the strongly varying acquisition parameters applied by the participants
of the LUM cluster required additional global data analysis prior
to an adequate data evaluation (Figure 2B,C). After an internal referencing of selected spectra,
the relative peak positions show only marginal deviations, demonstrating
the applicability of luminescence spectroscopy to the investigation
of U(VI) speciation and the identification of single species. However,
among the results of all participants, the obtained luminescence lifetimes
displayed a broad distribution range. These discrepancies likely arose
from the use of significantly differing experimental setups and algorithms
for the spectral analysis. These aspects were already addressed during
the first interlaboratory RRT on aqueous solutions of U(VI) studied
by LUM.15

3.1.3 X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy
The
discussion of the XAS results will be focused on samples U1 (pH 1)
and U4 (pH 3.5), which were analyzed by all groups (cf. Figure S20). As demonstrated in a recent comprehensive
study, samples U2 (pH 2) and U3 (pH 2.5) are known to contain species
mixtures that are impossible to be unequivocally resolved by XAFS
analysis based on four data points, that is, U(VI) acetate under four
different pH conditions.13 A detailed discussion
of the curve-fitting results and their interpretation is given in
the Supporting Information (Section S5.3).
To sum up most important findings (Table 1), we can conclude thatThe data sets for samples U1 and U4 obtained at different
beamlines are consistent.

U1: the presence
of the (1,0) species was unambiguously
confirmed by all three teams, and the structure reported in the literature
was reproduced better than within typical extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) error margins.

U2 and U3: complex mixtures of all the species considered
cannot be differentiated using EXAFS through measurements of only
four data points, but a clear spectral trend is discernible from the
EXAFS measurements of participants XAS-2 and -3.

U4: the dominant presence of the (1,3) species was confirmed
by all the cluster’s participants. However, uncertainties in
CN determination might cause different interpretations of the coordination
schemes for the same data set.

The final point underpins the general importance of
a priori speciation
information that might be necessary for obtaining a conclusive picture
from EXAFS curve fit analysis. Conversely, any EXAFS shell fitting
analysis will be prone to be biased by such a priori knowledge.

3.1.4 NMR Spectroscopy
The NMR data are
remarkably consistent and show little variation among the five independent
groups. A detailed discussion of both 1H and 13C spectra is given in the Supporting Information (Section S5.4). The use of an internal standard as well as the reliability
of modern NMR spectrometers allows excellent and reproducible results.
Based on the control samples, the impact of the pH on the acetate
spectra was found to be negligible. Hence, the speciation of the acetate
molecule does not significantly change in this pH range. Conversely,
systematic changes are observed in the spectra of the U(VI) acetate
samples with increasing pH. This effect is most dramatic in the 13C spectra (Figure 3), where the signal representing the carboxyl group broadens
considerably with pH. This line broadening is attributed to the exchange
between free and bound acetate groups, which is in the range of the
relaxation time of the resonance signal. NMR spectroscopy can be used
to examine high exchange rates of such molecular complexes in solution
and has successfully been applied to binary and ternary U(VI) complexes.16 The observation of only one averaged peak per
position in the 1H and 13C spectra of the U(VI)
acetate complex system even at the higher field clearly indicates
a fast exchange rate. The differences observed in the line widths
of the signals measured at the same field (at 400 MHz) are mainly
due to the variations in the homogeneity of the magnetic field, that
is, due to the differences in the shimming procedure. At higher fields,
the chemical shifts differ more (in Hz) between the exchanging sites
(free acetate and complexes), and the exchange-averaged signals are
broader compared to those in the 400 MHz spectra.

Figure 3 13C NMR spectroscopic
data of the methyl (left) and
carboxyl regions (right). Comparison of the chemical shifts (top)
and linewidths (below) for samples U1–U4 obtained by different
RRT participants. Note that for better comparison the same line broadening
factor (lb) was applied to the raw data (see Tables S11 and S12).

As neither the chemical shifts of the individual exchanging
species
nor their relative population are known, simulation of the spectra
via a matrix formalism cannot be applied to extract kinetic information.
Adequate results can be achieved only by running experiments at lower
temperatures, but these are far beyond the scope of this RRT. Nevertheless,
the observations of increased linewidths and chemical shifts in the
current data set are consistent with earlier findings, suggesting
a correlation of the linewidths with the concentration of the U(VI)
acetate species.16

3.1.5 Theory/QCC
DFT is the most widely
used method for calculations of uranyl(VI) complexes because U(VI)
formally exhibits a 5f0 electronic configuration, and thus
a single-configurational approach is appropriate. The effect of the
spin–orbit coupling is only marginal for most of the properties
considered here, and therefore, it was neglected. We tested various
DFT functionals and a wave function method (MP2). The structural and
spectroscopic properties of the two most relevant species, that is,
the complexes (1,0) and (1,3), and the energy of ligand replacement,
that is from (1,0) to (1,3), were calculated. The results are given
in Tables S13 and S14 (Supporting Information). The detailed discussion in the Supporting Information (Section S5.5) focuses on the results obtained
with the same basis set for various methods (Programs Gaussian, TURBOMOLE,
and ParaGauss), as summarized in Tables S10 and 2, together with ADF results in solution
for comparison.

The results suggest that the calculated
spectroscopic parameters
depend considerably on the optimized structures. Generally, all methods
satisfactorily reproduce the U–Oax distances, whereas
the U–Oeq distances are generally overestimated
compared to experimental data. To fully evaluate the calculated results,
they must be compared with the experimental results, which will be
done in the next section.

3.2 Molecular
Aspects of the U(VI) Speciation
Derived from Each Cluster’s Results
In this section,
the results and interpretational approaches obtained from each cluster
are analyzed with respect to the aqueous U(VI) acetate speciation.
As a synopsis, Table 3 displays the consistency of the data obtained and the results of
interpretational approaches. The predominant U(VI) species in samples
U1 and U4 are expected to be the (1,0) and (1,3) species, respectively.
At variance, for samples U2 and U3, the presence of several species
is expected where the predominance of uranyl complexes with an increasing
number of ligands increases with pH. Thus, to evaluate the data across
all clusters, the (1,0) and (1,3) species are discussed first.

The unequivocal data provided by the spectroscopic clusters for
sample U1 facilitate the assignment of the spectral features observed
to the predominant aqueous (1,0) species. This conclusion is explicitly
supported by the VIB and XAS clusters. All participants performing
Raman and infrared spectroscopy concordantly assigned the spectral
data showing the symmetric (ν1(UO2)) and
asymmetric (ν3(UO2)) stretching vibrational
modes to the fully hydrated uranyl ion. Furthermore, the structure
of the aqueous uranyl complex, in which the UO22+ moiety is coordinated by 5 water molecules in the equatorial plane,
is unambiguously reproduced by EXAFS shell fitting by all three participating
beamline groups. However, regarding the results of the U1 sample from
the LUM cluster, the assignment of the predominant species as the
(1,0) species is mainly based on the prevailing conditions.

The (1,3) species is unequivocally identified by all participants
in the VIB and XAS clusters. Based on the highly consistent spectral
data, the interpretational approaches used by the participants differ
only slightly. Most participants interpreted the spectral data in
terms of the predominance of the (1,3) species with a structure, in
which all three acetate ligands are bidentately coordinated to the
uranyl moiety. From the VIB data, only one set of Raman spectra was
not assigned to the (1,3) species, while in one set of IR spectra,
the presence of an even higher coordinated U(VI) acetate complex,
the (1,4) species, was discussed but was subsequently considered to
be unlikely because of steric considerations. Moreover, according
to one set of XAS data, the (1,3) species was considered to exhibit
a mixed type of coordination of the ligands, that is, two bidentately
and one monodentately bound ligand.

In contrast, the assignment
of spectral features to the (1,1) and
(1,2) species is generally less clear. Only the vibrational spectra
exhibit a spectral feature, namely the frequency of the ν(UO2) modes, that directly correlates with the formation of each
species and thus allows the unambiguous assignment of four distinct
species. However, even the interpretation of vibrational data is hampered
by overlapping signals, and the assignment of these species is not
completely consistent in case of the Raman spectra. Note, however,
that the Raman spectroscopy results of this RRT convincingly revise
previous literature data.17 For the XAS
and LUM clusters, identifying these species is not possible for various
reasons. For EXAFS spectroscopy, this is mainly due to the number
of samples being too small, as shown previously.13 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the spectrum of
the (1,2) species intrinsically cannot be derived from EXAFS data.13 Indeed, the LUM data from all contributors demonstrate
that each sample shows its characteristic spectral fingerprint; however,
specific species can be extracted only when an extensive parametric
analysis of a larger data set is available than the one generated
within this RRT.

NMR spectroscopy is a non-optical spectroscopic
technique that
exclusively provides signals reflecting changes of the energy differences
in nuclear spin states in hydrogen and carbon atoms of the ligand,
which differentiates this technique from the other spectroscopic methods
used in this RRT. On the one hand, the slight shifts observed in the 1H and 13C spectra nicely represent the ongoing
complexation of the uranyl moiety by acetate molecules as the pH increases.
On the other hand, an assignment of the signals observed to distinct
species is not possible. As already stated in Section 3.1.4, a more detailed analysis
yielding speciation information can be obtained only by conducting
much more extensive experiments, which are beyond the scope of this
RRT.

A principal concern of this RRT was the juxtaposition of
the results
obtained from the experimental and theoretical approaches. For the
sake of simplicity, the calculations focused on the (1,0) and (1,3)
species assuming the penta–aquo complex UO2(H2O)52+ for the (1,0) species and the
exclusively bidentate complex UO2(CH3COO)3– for the (1,3) species.

In general,
the accuracy of the calculated values of the interatomic
distances and the vibrational frequencies agree well with experimental
results but the quality of the results depends slightly on the method
applied (Table 2).
Compared to the structures in the gas phase (Table S10), the calculations including solvation effects provide
slightly longer U–Oax distances and slightly shorter
U–Oeq distances (Tables S10 and 2). Solvation effects slightly improve
the agreement with EXAFS results for U–Oeq and in
some cases also for U–Oax distances. As an example,
the solvation calculations of both the (1,0) and (1,3) species at
the MP2 level gave bond distances that are all within 0.02 Å
of the values from the EXAFS data (Table 2). At the DFT level, the deviations are slightly
larger. Depending on the type of functional, the deviations from the
experimental bond distances can be as large as 0.1 Å (Table S14). For all methods, a trend to overestimating
the lengths of U–O bonds to the ligands has to be noted, by
0.06 Å for (1,0) and by 0.03 Å for (1,3) on average. The
geometry differences between the species (1,0) and (1,3) are qualitatively
reproduced by all methods. The increase of U–Oax by about 0.01 Å und the increase of U–Oeq by about 0.05 Å due to complexation, as observed by EXAFS,
are overestimated for U–Oax and underestimated for
U–Oeq by about 0.02 Å in all calculations (Table 2). In general, calculated
differences of properties should be more accurate than absolute values
due to favorable error cancelation. On the other hand, the observed
deviations from experiment are not unexpected due to limitations of
the solvation modeling in the calculations and due to some contributions
from species with less than three acetate ligands in probe U4 in the
experiment (see Figure S2).

The calculated
harmonic vibrational frequencies of the ν1 and ν3(UO2) modes are consistent
with the experimental values. Not surprisingly, the better the agreement
between the experimental and theoretical bond distances, the better
tends to be the agreement in vibrational frequencies (irrespective
of gas phase or aqueous phase calculations). For instance, the calculations
at the MP2 level, which coincide well with the experimental bond distances,
provide an average deviation of only 17 cm–1 (max.
27 cm–1) between the theoretical and experimental
ν1/ν3(UO2) frequencies
(Table 2). The results
obtained with the M06L functional with ParaGauss are only slightly
less accurate. In line with the overestimation of the increase of
the U–Oax bond due to acetate complexation in the
calculations, the red shift of the uranyl stretching vibrations as
a result of acetate complexation, which amounts to about 30 cm–1 in experiment, is overestimated by all methods by
at least 30 cm–1 (Table 2). The difference between ν3 and ν1 is well reproduced by MP2 (Table 2, overestimated for (1,0) =
2 cm–1, for (1,3) = 13 cm–1),
but underestimated by DFT by 40 cm–1 for (1,0) and
30 cm–1 for (1,3) on average (Table 2). These findings of systematic deviations
support the assumption of differences between experiment and theory
due to model aspects in the calculations and additional species in
the experimental probes (see above).

Besides, it should be noted
that there are three essential sources
of errors in computations: the model choice, the electronic structure
method, including the particular (relativistic) treatment of the core
electrons, and the solvation treatment. Commonly some error cancelation
may be expected. One may therefore always argue that good agreement
with experiments may simply be a coincidence and computational results
always warrant a critical evaluation.

This RRT demonstrates
that the basic molecular parameters of small
actinide complexes obtained using QCC are accurate with respect to
the experimental findings. In particular, the interatomic distances
are obviously predicted with higher accuracy than vibrational frequencies
(for which rescaling is a rather common practice). Deviations of calculated
parameters from the experimental values, averaged over all methods
applied, amount to 1–2.5% for bond lengths and to 4–6%
for the uranyl stretching vibrations. For well-defined systems and
with a proper choice of the method, an even better agreement with
experiment is achievable. Small systematic deviations, especially
of differences of properties, point to limitations of the models used
in the calculations and uncertainties of speciation in the experimental
probes: thus, such differences are of special interest and are helpful
for improving calculations as well as the interpretation of experiments.

4 Conclusions and Perspectives
4.1 Evaluation
of the RRT
The concept
of this RRT based on the contributions of a broad array of spectroscopic
techniques and QC approaches to the aqueous U(VI) speciation exemplified
for the U(VI) acetate system. This project intended to collect results
from as many laboratories with dedicated expertise in the molecular
analysis of actinides as possible. Hence, for the sake of practicability,
the scale of the RRT had to be restricted to a relatively small number
of samples, which can hardly be considered as adequate for a thorough
investigation of an aqueous speciation as complex as the U(VI) acetate
system. In consequence, a conclusive evaluation of the RRT shall be
restricted to some general, yet still-instructive aspects. Table 4 summarizes the major
findings of the applied techniques as well as their strengths and
limitations concerning the U-acetate complex system.

The generally high
consistency of the data, obtained within each
cluster, reflects the accuracy and suitability of the techniques applied
for the exploration of the uranyl complex system. In particular, those
techniques conducted on commercial instruments provided highly consistent
data, as shown by the results of the VIB and NMR clusters. Despite
having worked on different beamlines and individually adapted setups,
even accelerator-driven XAS provided highly consistent raw data. Regarding
the characteristic specifications of the single facilities, one of
the merits of this RRT is explicitly demonstrating the reproducibility
of the performance of the three participating synchrotron beamlines.

A distinct comparison of the luminescence spectral data was only
feasible after performing a correction routine for wavelength calibration,
as described in Sections 3.1.2 and S5.2. At first, the
consistency of luminescence data appeared to be quite low. This inconsistency
might raise questions about the comparability of the spectral analysis,
which was performed based on only simple spectral fingerprinting published
previously. Conversely, when the spectra were referenced internally
to the spectral distances of the peaks, the data within the LUM cluster
demonstrated high reproducibility. However, considering the data of
the luminescence decay curves provided by the respective participants,
a comparison of the spectral data is hardly possible, as described
in Section S5.2. In fact, these aspects
were already addressed in a previous RRT in 2003.15

Multimethodological approaches to the analysis of
molecular complexes
are expected to benefit from the acquisition of complementary information.
Potentially, this advantage might be derived from IR and Raman spectroscopy
because of the intrinsic selection rules of the vibrational modes
observed in the respective spectra. In fact, four prevailing species
and the interacting functional groups in the molecular complexes could
be evidently derived from the vibrational spectra (see Sections 3.1.1 and S5.1). This information was nicely reflected
by the results in the NMR cluster, which provided evidence for the
increasing degree of complexation of the uranyl moiety with increasing
pH (see Sections 3.1.4 and S5.4). As the results from
the LUM and XAS cluster indicated the presence of only three species,
the missing complementarity of these techniques with the former ones
must be discussed in more detail.

Due to the intrinsic properties
of the EXAFS spectra, the (1,2)
species cannot be differentiated from the other species which is largely
due to symmetry reasons as already mentioned above (see Sections 3.1.3 and S5.3). Hence, such intrinsic limitations, which
might not be obvious even to advanced spectroscopists, must be understood
prior to performing extensive series of experiments. The intrinsic
luminescence properties of the species might also be responsible for
the lower number of species observed using LUM. One of the species—most
likely the (1,1) species—was assumed to be not luminescent.
Although an ultimate verification is still lacking, this explanation
would clearly elucidate why comprehensive complementary information
was not obtained from the LUM cluster. However, it has to be emphasized
that the number of samples was certainly insufficient for a thorough
investigation of the speciation, particularly in the case of luminescent
spectroscopy.

Consequently, to gain maximum benefit from a multimethodological
approach exploring the U(VI) acetate speciation, the techniques must
be carefully selected, which requires a detailed knowledge of their
capabilities and restrictions. Even then, experienced users might
suffer from unexplored details of intrinsic properties of the molecules
under investigation. At this point, theoretical calculations, as they
represent an independent and thus complementary approach to molecular
properties, appear particularly valuable. As shown in this RRT, results
from various QC codes are very consistent when the same stationary
points of the species under study are considered. Bond distances are
well reproduced with the MP2 and a number of DFT approaches, while
vibrational frequencies show slightly larger deviations, but are still
useful for the assignment of the spectral findings to distinct molecular
structures. Nevertheless, the general trends of geometry and vibrational
parameters of the U(VI) acetate system are calculated in agreement
with the experiment. Small systematic deviations from the experimental
results, which are independent of the detailed method applied, are
of special interest, as they point to weaknesses of the models applied
and/or the need for a more detailed understanding of the system considered
in the experiments. DFT calculations predict chemical shifts of NMR
signals quite precisely. In the future, the development of algorithms
providing reliable calculations of luminescent spectra is desired.

In summary, this RRT was very successful in terms of the high number
of participants throughout the community and their acceptance to share
their expertise and experimental (unpublished) data. Furthermore,
the cooperation and willingness of the participants to contribute
to the discussions during the compilation process of the RRT illustrate
the profound interest in improving the performance of the various
techniques and in continuing the knowledge transfer among scientists
from various analytical disciplines to obtain a deeper understanding
of basic molecular complexes in actinide chemistry.

4.2 Scope and Perspectives
In the past
decades, significant progress in laser technology, microfluidics,
digital signal processing, and the development of novel light detectors
has contributed to dramatic efficiency enhancements of spectroscopic
methods in terms of significantly reduced accumulation times and increase
in quality of spectra. Consequently, due to improved signal-to-noise
ratios in the spectra, the extraction of further molecular information
by numerical analysis has gained importance in spectroscopic investigations.
Apart from classical analysis methods, such as curve decomposition
or factor analysis, which have been applied intensively ever since,
various statistical methods—chemometrics in particular—have
been developed for processing these data and extracting essential
information. However, only the accurate application of such statistical
methods prohibits from misinterpretation of the results, which might
lead to erroneous understanding otherwise.18 This particularly refers to well-established fitting procedures,
which often appear to be poorly documented in scientific articles.
Hence, the provision of comprehensive numerical information necessary
for the reproduction of such an analysis is indispensable. Moreover,
we felt confident through this RRT that it is necessary to establish
a method utilizing chemometrics as a routine tool for characterization
of molecular structures. In the future, further development of dimension
reduction and feature extraction methods such as self-organizing maps
is foreseen to contribute further to molecular spectroscopy.

A key concern of this RRT was the elicitation of the mutual promotion
of QC calculations and spectroscopic approaches. The results presented
provide a widely consistent molecular understanding of the (1,0) and
(1,3) uranyl acetate species, even though theoretical predictions
and experimental findings showed some discrepancies to a different
extent with respect to the different spectroscopic techniques. Hence,
the development or improvement of algorithms explicitly considering
the intrinsic properties of specific spectroscopic techniques is expected
to enhance the concordance of theoretical and experimental approaches
and appears therefore necessary. If an intense communicative exchange
of theoreticians and experimentalists generates a mutual understanding
of their operational modes and mindsets, future work might proceed
in extracting specific information from complex experimental data
and vice versa in verifying theoretical investigations by experimental
findings.

On a technical level of instrumentation, this RRT
demonstrated
the importance of the availability of experimental parameters. Only
detailed sets of relevant instrumental parameters strengthen the sustainability
of the data presented and might provide the basis for future technical
improvements. In this context, it was shown that a commonly accepted
and applied calibration routine for LUM is mandatory though hard to
be implemented throughout worldwide researchers. Nevertheless, we
suggest a suitable calibration approach in the Supporting Information (cf. Figure S21). This approach follows
the procedure already described earlier using the emission line of
a conventional Hg lamp.19 In the future,
it is eligible to represent luminescence spectra on an energy scale
(wavenumber units) instead of a wavelength scale. This would facilitate
the comparability of spectral features observed under different experimental
setups, thereby data interpretation by various researchers becoming
more perspicuous and comprehensible.
