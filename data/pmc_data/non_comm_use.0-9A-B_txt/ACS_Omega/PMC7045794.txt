Compared
to the shale gas and coalbed methane in China, tight gas has been
recently considered as a priority in the exploration and exploitation
of unconventional gas resources. In the development of a tight gas
field, how to enhance the gas recovery is a prevalent topic. Unlike
the conventional gas reservoir, the ultimate gas recovery is not only
determined by the geological characteristics but is also affected
by other factors such as well drainage area and well spacing design.
For tight sandstone reservoirs, the gas recovery can be improved by
increasing the drainage area. Moreover, the well drainage area is
closely associated with well spacing. Therefore, effective drainage
area estimation and well spacing optimization are essential aspects
for tight gas exploitation. In this paper, a new optimization workflow
is established, which combined dynamic analysis and numerical simulation
techniques. First, through interference well test results and production
data dynamic analysis, the total gas production can be expressed and
predicted. Then the well density can be optimized by the economic
evaluation method. Meanwhile, a numerical model is built up to determine
the optimal well spacing. This new optimization workflow can provide
guidance to the operators of tight gas fields where the interference
well test results are available and several years of production data
are collected. Furthermore, in the case of the Sulige gas field, the
single well drainage area is estimated and the optimal well pattern
is obtained by the established approach. The results indicate that
the well pattern of 500 m × 600 m is most reasonable for the
pilot gas field.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In the world energy market, the consumption of natural gas is progressively
increasing. In 2018, natural gas had a remarkable increase of 4.6%
in consumption and 5.2% in production due to the U.S. shale revolution.
Even some projections point out that natural gas consumption will
surpass oil and coal resources, topping the list of fossil fuel energy
by 2030.1−4 This upcoming change meets the common demands for environmentally
friendly and sustainable development all around the world. In recent
years, unconventional gas including tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed
methane plays a more and more important role in world energy supply.
In China, the production of tight gas exceeded 343 × 108 m3, contributing 23.2% of the total natural gas output
of 1480.3 × 108 m3 in 2017.1−4 Currently, tight gas is probably the most promising clean energy
resource in China.

There are many difficulties and challenges
in the development process,5 such as low
permeability and small drainage area, which result in low gas recovery.
For low permeability formations, the ultimate gas recovery is strongly
associated with well drainage area, which is dominated by the well
placing design. Meanwhile, the estimation of effective drainage area
is the basis for well spacing optimization. The estimation methods
of effective drainage area with dynamic analysis include material
balance equation, type curve analysis, and other production analysis.6 The RTA analysis method through the log–log
type curve is applied in this article to evaluate the single well
controlled area by a current well pattern. With the understanding
of single well controlled area, the optimization result of the well
pattern can be more accurate. At present, the optimization methods
of the well pattern for tight gas reservoirs mainly include the geostatistical
method,7,8 production potential method,9,10 gas reservoir mathematical method,11−13 and numerical simulation
method.14 He et al. optimized the well
spacing and well array by the numerical simulation method, which takes
the geological complexity into consideration. Then they regarded the
interference well test results as a verification of the numerical
simulation optimization method.14 They
focused on numerical calculation but failed to make full use of the
interference well test data and production data. Onwunalu and Durlofsky12,13 proposed a new well pattern optimization method by introducing a
new well pattern description and combined it with a particle-swarm
optimization technique. They accomplished the optimization by transforming
the optimizing object from the well pattern itself into parameters
associated with the well pattern. They completed a perfect work in
well pattern type and well pattern geometry determination. However,
the connectivity between wells is not involved. Therefore, a thorough
approach of well spacing determination for tight gas is urgently needed.

2 Theory
The determination of a reasonable well pattern
depends on dynamic analysis and numerical simulation methods. Rate
transient analysis, interference well testing, and statistical analysis
contribute to the estimation of drainage area and ultimate recovery
used to optimize the well density, as shown in Figure 1. Meanwhile, the commonly used numerical
method can serve as a verification of the dynamic method and can help
determine the optimal well spacing and well array.

Figure 1 Research idea of the
optimization.

2.1 Overview of the Target
Pilot Field
The Sulige gas field, a typical tight sandstone
gas reservoir in China, is located in the Ordos basin where the depositional
environment was pericontinental marine during the early Ordovician
to early Paleozoic. It was first discovered in 2001 and has been explored
and developed since 2006. The target pilot gas field is located in
the southern part of the Sulige gas field with 67.6 km2 in area. The exploration of the block began in 2008, and well logging
and core sample investigation reveal that the average net pay thickness
is about 10.7 m around the pilot gas field. Through core sample analysis,
it shows that the porosity ranges from 3 to 13% and the average value
is 7.9%. The permeability ranges from 0.006 to 0.680 md, and the average
value is 0.108 md.

2.2 Effective Drainage Area
Estimation
For the conventional gas reservoir, the ultimate
recovery is determined by the geological characteristics of the reservoir
itself when depletion exploitation is applied, while for the unconventional
gas reservoir, it is a different situation. Because of the extremely
low permeability and complex pore throat structure, the single well
drainage area is far smaller than the ideal reservoir. That is why
the drainage area becomes a key factor that affects the ultimate gas
recovery. Decline curve analysis, material balance equation, and production
analysis are widely used to estimate the drainage of a tight gas well.
Gas production analysis is a type curve matching technique used in
formation property interpretation.

According to the type curve
analysis theories, the maximum volume for fluid production can be
calculated when the boundary flow (pseudo-steady state, PSS) is detected
by the advent of a unit slope straight line on a diagnostic
log–log or Blasingame plot. In other words, the single well
drainage area can be estimated with the observation of a straight
line on a log–log plot of rate normalized pressure integral
(divided by equivalent time) and its derivative versus equivalent
time. As shown in Figure 2, the single well drainage area of Well S1 can be obtained
by commercial software, which is 0.35 km2.

Figure 2 Drainage area estimation
by log–log type curve (Well S1).

In the target block, production data of 56 wells are gathered to
calculate the current single well drainage area using PPS flow regime
recognition. Most of these wells can provide more than 5 years production
data. The estimated results are shown in Figure 3. It indicates that, after more than 5 years
of development, the average single well drainage area is 0.25 km2 currently, and more than 90% of the 56 wells’ drainage
areas are less than 0.4 km2.

Figure 3 Cumulative distribution
of single well drainage area.

2.3 Interference Well Testing Analysis
In order
to make a better understanding of the connectivity of the Sulige gas
field, extensive interference well testing was performed with pressure
measuring equipment installed at the bottom of the selected wells.
After well testing interpreting, the interference probability (F)15 can be defined as the ratio
between the amount of interfering wells (ni) and total wells (ntotal) 1  

Based on the statistical analysis of interference well testing
results, the relationship between interference probability and well
density can be obtained. There is a relatively good relationship between
well density and interference probability, as shown in Figure 4. Then the relationship can
be expressed as eq 2 2  

Figure 4 Relationship
between well density and interference probability.

The interference probability can represent the possibility
of interference happening between gas wells. That is, when the reservoir
is developed with a dense well pattern, the well interference happens
more often, so the interference probability is higher; otherwise,
when the well density is low, the interference probability is lower.
Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between interference probability
and well density is a crucial factor in the whole well density optimization
method, which needs lots of interference well testing data and statistical
analysis.

2.4 Gas Well Production Estimation
The
total gas production equals the sum of production of interfering wells
and noninterfering wells. A noninterfering well can be treated as
one single well in a tiny independent depletion reservoir. On the
other hand, the interfering wells can be regarded as multiwells producing
in one closed gas reservoir since they are interconnected to some
extent.

2.4.1 Production of a Noninterfering Well
As wells in the pilot site are mostly producing under a constant
pressure, the Arps decline curves can be applied. According to Arps
laws,16 when n = 0.5 3  

Then
the single well cumulative gas production can be expressed as follows 4  

By setting  and , eq 4 can be transformed into 5  

Through matching the production data of noninterfering wells in Sulige,
the values of Di and qi can be determined. Then the cumulative production of a
single noninterfering well can be estimated by eq 6 6  where t is the production time, year; and Gnf is the single well cumulative production of interfering
well, 104 m3.

2.4.2 Production
of the Noninterfering Well
Researchers found that there was
a good polynomial regression relationship between well density and
the production ratio of interfering well to noninterfering well,15 as shown in Figure 5. In this way, the production of interfering
wells can be expressed as a function of well density.

Figure 5 Statistical relationship
between Gf/Gnf and well density.

 7  where Gf is the single well cumulative production of
interfering well, 104 m3; and s is the well density, wells/km2.

2.4.3 Gas
Recovery Estimation
For a tight gas field with interference
well testing results, the gas well production can be calculated through
interference probability and well density. Then the optimization method
can be applied regarding the overall profit and ultimate gas recovery
as objective indicators to determine the optimal well density.

According to the definition of gas recovery, the ultimate gas recovery
can be given by 8  where G is accumulative gas production, 104 m3; R is ultimate gas recovery, %; N is gas volume initially in place, 104 m3; A is reservoir area, km2; and B is reserve abundance, 104 m3/km2.

2.5 Optimization by Economic
Indicator and Gas Recovery
According to the results of drainage
area estimation and the well patterns commonly used in the Sulige
gas field, eight typical well patterns were designed for economic
evaluation analysis, as shown in Table 1. As mentioned before, the current single well drainage
area is about 0.25 km2. Meanwhile, among these eight groups,
there are two groups where single well controlled area is smaller
than the current single well drainage area, two groups that are close
to the current value, and four groups that are larger than 0.3 km2.

Table 1 Well Pattern Design for Economic Evaluation
well array/m	500	600	700	800	
well spacing/m	400	600	600	600	
300	500	500	500	
Then based on the relevant
parameters recommended by “Economic Evaluation Parameters and
Methods of Construction Project of China National Petroleum Corporation”
(Table 2), an optimization
method of well density can be built up.

Table 2 Reference
Values for Profit Calculation
parameter	unit	value	
area A	km2	67.6	
reservoir abundance B	104 m3/km2	14,800	
commodity rate V	decimal	0.96	
taxes W	yuan/104 m3	1300	
single well investment b	104 yuan/well	85	
natural
gas price P	yuan/104 m3	12,000	
operating cost C	yuan/104 m3	5000	
time	year	20	
The profit of gas production equals total sales income
minus total expenditure. Meanwhile, total sales income equals total
gas volume multiply by gas price, and total expenditure equals investment
cost plus operating cost and taxes. Then the total gas production
can be given by 9  

So,
the profit can be obtained 10  where A is reservoir area, km2; s is well density, wells/km2; V is commodity rate, decimal; P is the natural gas
price, yuan/104 m3; b is the
investment cost, 104 yuan/well; C is the
operating cost, yuan/104 m3; W is the taxes, yuan/104 m3; F is the interference probability, %; and Pf is the profit, 104 yuan.

Then, when Pf = 0, the economic limit well density
is obtained, while the absolute maximum value of Pf is the optimal
profit when s is between 0 and 8. The corresponding s is the optimal well density. Based on the values in Table 2, the economic limit
well density is 5.8 and the optimal well density is 3.2.

Then
the curve of profit and well density and the curve of gas recovery
versus well density are drawn in the same graph, as shown in Figure 6. Through observing
the two curves, they both have inflection points. For the profit curve,
when well density is lower than 3.2, the profit value shows an upward
trend. However, when passing the inflection point, the profit tends
to decrease gradually. Meanwhile, for the gas recovery curve, when
well density is lower than 3.2, the recovery value increases rapidly.
On the other hand, when well density exceeds the inflection point,
the upward trend turns flatter. Therefore, both evaluation indicators
show that the inflection point is the optimal well density for the
target gas field block. The corresponding optimal well pattern is
500 m × 600 m.

Figure 6 Well density optimization results with profit and gas
recovery.

2.6 Numerical
Simulation
2.6.1 Reservoir Geological Modeling
Reservoir
modeling was conducted by combining a sedimentological study, sequence
stratigraphic analysis, geostatistical simulations, and production
data analysis. Former research revealed that the Ordos basin during
the Upper Permian and Lower Triassic was a braided channel.17 The reservoir commonly consists of small ribbon
channel deposits interbedded with mudstones.

The numerical model
was scaled up with a grid interval of 100 m in vertical and 100 m
in horizontal. The reservoir is described by 90 × 76 grids in
horizontal and 2 lays in vertical, that is, 13,680 grids in total.
In addition, according to the fracture half-length obtained from production
dynamic analysis, local grid refinement is applied to ensure the accuracy
of reservoir characterization. The number of local refinement grids
of 67 wells is 864. Then the total amount of numerical grids is 14,544.
The static parameters, reservoir fluids, rock parameters, and historical
data provided by the geological model were imported into the numerical
model (Figure 7). In
order to provide a correct model for the coming predictions, the numerical
model was modified by history matching including reserve matching
and production history matching as shown in Figures 8 and 9.

Figure 7 Gridding of
the geological model for the target block.

Figure 8 History
matching of total gas production.

Figure 9 History
matching of daily gas production.

Based on the reservoir numerical model, 14 simulation cases are designed
with different well spacings and well arrays, as shown in Table 3. The optimization
is implemented by comparing the single well cumulative production
of each simulation case. Specifically, the well spacing ranges from
400 to 1000 m and well array ranges from 500 to 1000 m, then the single
well cumulative production is simulated for further comparison. First,
the well array with constant well spacing is changed to determine
the optimal well array. Second, the well spacing with a fixed optimal
well array is changed to determine the well spacing.

Table 3 Well Spacing Design for Numerical Simulation
well array/m	500	600	800	1000	
well spacing/m	500	600	800	1000	
400	500	600	800	
 	400	500	600	
 	 	400	500	
 	 	 	400	
The simulation results show
that the single well cumulative gas volume (well spacing 500 m) increases
as the well array increases. However, there is a special point at
600 m (Figure 10),
from where the slope of the curve turns lower. Therefore, 600 m should
be considered as the optimal well array. In the same way, 500 m should
be the optimal well spacing (Figure 11).

Figure 10 Well array optimization (well spacing = 500).

Figure 11 Well spacing optimization (well array = 1000).

3 Results and Discussion
1. Generally, the advent
of the PSS flow regime signifies the emergence of boundary flow.Through
flow regime production analysis and interference well tests, the drainage
areas of 56 wells in the Sulige pilot site are evaluated. The results
show that 90% of these 56 wells’ drainage areas are less than
0.4 km2 and the average value of drainage area is 0.25
km2.

2. Optimization
with two indicators—profit and gas recovery—shows that
the optimal well density is 3.2 wells/km2. Compared with
the drainage area estimated by type curves, the optimal well density
is larger than the current one, which indicates that the current well
pattern is not the most effective and can be improved by drilling
more infilling wells properly.

3. Numerical simulation results show that there is an inflection point
in the curve. The single well cumulative gas production increases
as well array increases from 500 to 1000 m. Meanwhile, the upward
trend turns flatter at 600 m, illustrating that 600 m is the optimal
well array. In the same manner, the optimal well spacing 500 m can
be determined as well.

4. The numerical simulation optimization can be regarded as an independent
method, but it is also a verification of the aforementioned well density
optimization method. Results show that the two methods are consistent.
Generally, the dynamic analysis optimization method is an alternative
approach to help determine the optimal well spacing when the geological
situation is not accurate enough to make the production forecast but
the production dynamic data is available.



4 Conclusions
Drainage area of the tight gas well is
closely related to the ultimate gas recovery. It is an important index
throughout the gas field development process. In this paper, the drainage
areas of 56 wells in the Sulige basin are evaluaed through the production
dynamic analysis method. The result shows that, after more than 5
years of exploitation, the average value of current drainage area
is 0.25 km2. This provides an important reference for the
subsequent well spacing optimization. It indicates that the reasonable
single well controlled area of well pattern design should be more
than 0.25 km2; otherwise, well interference might happen
more often.

In addition, an approach to optimize well spacing
in tight gas is presented through engineering dynamic analysis and
numerical simulation methods in this article. It involves production
decline analysis, statistical analysis, and interference well testing
interpretation. The results indicate that a well pattern of 500 m
× 600 m should be the optimal scenario. The optimization method
established can be used to help determine well pattern design both
for the new gas reservoir and mature gas field with interference well
testing data. Meanwhile, with the development of tight gas fields,
more production data can be collected to estimate well drainage area
more accurately. This can help to improve the well pattern design
for a higher gas recovery.
