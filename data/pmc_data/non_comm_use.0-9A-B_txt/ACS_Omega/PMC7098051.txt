The use of nanomaterials has transformed
fields such as medicine
and electronics. However, aggregation of nanomaterials in aqueous
solutions, difficult recovery of spent nano-adsorbents from reactors,
and a tremendous pressure loss caused by nano-adsorbents in adsorption
columns have prevented the wide-scale use of nano-adsorbents in industrial
applications for water purification. An over-reliance on traditional
adsorption media for fluid purification practices has slowed innovation
in this field. This study serves as a proof of concept for a new approach
in utilizing nano-adsorbents in water treatment. A system based on
the concept of renal dialysis was used to treat a solution of arsenite
using two-line ferrihydrite (Fh) under environmental conditions. The
performance was compared to traditional batch studies, and environmental
variables pH and Eh were monitored. The system removed 67 and 91%
of arsenite at 1.22 and 2.61 g/L Fh loadings, respectively, in comparison
to batch experiments that removed 82 and 94% for similar loadings.
Operational conditions and the physical design of the vessel limited
the extent of removal that could be obtained with the system. Design
advantages, shortcomings, and required improvements are discussed.

==== Body
Introduction
Adsorption has emerged
as a cost-effective method for fluid purification,
including water treatment. Unfortunately, large-scale adsorption technologies
have failed to evolve as quickly as new materials have been discovered.
In the water treatment industry, much of the industry still heavily
relies on activated carbon, microsized metal oxides, and ion exchange
resins. Nanomaterials are not suitable for conventional fixed bed
or flow-through systems. They create large pressure drops, have poor
mechanical strength, and, more importantly, are difficult to separate
from water.1 Although some researchers
have attempted to fix nano-adsorbents onto supporting media that can
be adapted to current treatment systems, this process inherently limits
the utility of the material.2 Much work
with nano-adsorption has remained at the laboratory stage, and translation
to industrial-scale use considerably lags in comparison to other fields
such as electronics and medicine.3

The concept of a hemodialyzer, which is used in medicine as a biomimetic
for artificial kidneys, suggests an alternative method for the application
of nanomaterials in water treatment. During hemodialysis, blood is
pumped into the hemodialyzer through an inlet and is distributed into
a membrane. Pressure and a concentration gradient induce mass transfer
through the membrane, and waste products and excess fluid are removed
as blood flows to the outlet. Simultaneously, a dialysate solution
is pumped in a counterflow direction outside the membrane and carries
away the waste.4,5 This same process can be adapted
for the use of nanomaterials in water treatment and fluid purification
in general. As a contaminated stream is passed on one side of a selective
membrane, a counterflowing service fluid of nano-adsorbents is passed
on the other side. As contaminants pass through the membrane, they
can be picked up by fast-acting nano-adsorbents. This concept can
also be applied more simply by passing a service fluid with unidirectional
flow over a membrane containing a stagnant contaminant solution.

In the following proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate a
simplified application of the hemodialyzer (renal dialysis) concept
for fluid purification. A dialysis system is utilized to adsorb arsenite
(as H3AsO3 at or near a circumneutral pH) with
two-line ferrihydrite (Fh). The system’s removal efficiency
is assessed and compared to traditional batch experiments. Changes
in environmental process variables Eh and pH are monitored and reported
throughout the treatment period. The Results and
Discussion section considers benefits and limitations of the
system and notes areas of needed improvement. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first-ever reported application of nanomaterials in dialysis-based
treatment. Motivation for the use of arsenic and Fh as a model contaminant
and nano-adsorbent, respectively, follows.

Arsenic is a naturally
occurring metalloid that is both abundant
and ubiquitous in the Earth’s crust and is released in large
quantities through industrial processes and agricultural applications.6,7 Exposure to arsenic occurs through contaminated food, water, and
air, and the risk of exposure and potential adverse health effects
have been well documented.7−10 In the environment, arsenic combines with other elements
and is found in several organic and inorganic forms,11 but arsenite is the most mobile and toxic.12,13 Adsorption of arsenic onto iron oxide minerals has been investigated
over the years,14−17 and Fh, a naturally occurring nanomaterial and precursor to more
crystalline iron oxides,18,19 has gained substantial
interest. Fh is an intrinsically nanodimensional material (2–3
nm diameter) with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area between 133 and 320 m2/g, a high adsorption capacity,20−24 and strong binding to arsenic via inner-sphere 2C and 2E complexes,24,25 which make it a desirable nano-adsorbent.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Fh
Fh used in
the experiments was
prepared using a solvent deficient method (SDM). The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) diffractogram in Figure 1 identifies the material as two-line Fh. The two broad peaks
at 35 and 62.5° that define two-line Fh are in good agreement
with Bragg peaks reported in the literature ranging from 34 to 35°
and 61 to 63° 2θ, respectively, for Cu Kα (λ
= 1.54060) irradiation.19,22,26−31 The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum in Figure 2 shows broad bands at 3400
and 3200 cm–1 attributable to structural hydroxide
and sorbed H2O, respectively. A series of peaks between
1750 and 800 cm–1 are associated with the various
vibrational modes of bicarbonate and carbonate, which are formed from
adsorbed CO2.32−35 As indicated by the white circle-bounded particles
in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Figure 3A, the material is composed
of individual particles with diameters less than 10 nm in size. Furthermore,
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 3B shows that the material is aggregated with
smaller particles of varying size and shape embedded into larger particles.
BET measurements show that Fh has a high surface area of 192 m2/g, falling within the lower end of values found in the literature
and lower than the 250 m2/g reported by Smith et al.26 However, different batches produced using the
SDM yielded surface areas varying from 192 to 329 m2/g
(Table S1), and special attention should
be paid to the reported surface area values (Table S2). The observed correlation between the adsorbent age and
measured surface area is discussed in the Supporting Information.

and SEM (B) images of Fh after synthesis by the SDM. Single
particles of Fh are bounded by white circles within the TEM image

Dialysis System Performance
The mechanism of arsenite
removal using the dialysis system is illustrated in Figure 4. A service fluid composed
of Fh particles suspended in water by mixing was pumped continuously
through the bottom inlet of a tube containing a membrane. Arsenite
that was manually added into the lumen of the membrane diffused into
the service solution over time and most adsorbed onto Fh particles
flowing through the tube.

Figure 4 Proposed dialysis system for the application
of nanomaterials in
fluid purification. Arsenite solution added to the lumen of the membrane
diffuses into the service solution and is adsorbed by Fh particles
that are continuously flowing up through the dialysis tube.

Figure 5A,B shows
the dialysis system’s removal of arsenite using 1.22 and 2.61
g/L Fh loadings. The amounts of arsenite in the lumen and in the service
fluid over time are presented as mass fractions of the total arsenite
added to the lumen initially. Total arsenite for the 1.22 and 2.61
g/L loadings was 20.2 and 25.1 mg, respectively. During treatment,
the amount of arsenite in the lumen decreased by 95% (1.22 g/L Fh)
and 98% (2.61 g/L Fh), and the amount of arsenite in the service fluid
slowly increased as arsenite was both distributed into the service
fluid and adsorbed by Fh. By the end of 3 h, adsorption was complete
as the concentration in the service fluid had plateaued. However,
the 2.61 g/L Fh loading had a lower residual mass of arsenite in the
service fluid, indicating that a greater portion of arsenite was adsorbed.

Figure 5 Residual
arsenite in the membrane lumen and service fluid of the
system over time for 1.22 (A) and 2.61 g/L (B) adsorbent loadings.
The amount of arsenite is presented as a mass fraction of total arsenic.

Adsorbed arsenite was calculated using a mass balance
on total
arsenite according to eq 1. 1  

In eq 1, CiLSViLS is the initial mass of arsenite in the lumen solution (total arsenic); CfLSVfLS is the mass of arsenite in the lumen solution at the end
of the experiment;  is the mass of arsenite sampled from the
service fluid during the runtime; CmSFVfSF is the
residual mass of arsenite in the service fluid at the end of the experiment;
and m is the total number of samples taken from the
service fluid. Thus, removal efficiency for each loading (REsys) was quantified by the mass fraction of the adsorbed arsenite and
was calculated at 67 and 91% for 1.22 and 2.61 g/L adsorbent loadings,
respectively. The 1.22 g/L loading with 20.2 mg of total arsenite
had a lower removal efficiency than the 2.61 g/L adsorbent loading
with 25.8 mg of total arsenite, suggesting that a smaller total arsenic
to Fh ratio results in better removal.

Changes in pH of the
system over the course of the treatment process
are shown in Figure 6A. The introduction of Fh into the service solution caused a sudden
drop in pH for both loadings. Fh has been reported to accumulate protons
when exposed to air through a series of reactions as carbon dioxide
adsorbs onto its bound water layer.32−34 This likely occurred
during the final drying stage of the synthetic process and is indicated
by the FTIR spectrum in Figure 3. The increased surface acidity transferred into the service
fluid during the addition of Fh and likely caused a pH drop proportional
to the loading. As treatment progressed, adsorption of arsenite onto
Fh caused the increase in pH for both loadings. It has been reported
that arsenite adsorbs onto Fh through several possible adsorption
reactions, resulting in either the net release of H+ or
OH– depending on the operating pH.36 The 2.61 g/L loading had a smaller pH recovery than the
1.22 g/L loading because of the higher initial acidity produced by
excess Fh.

Figure 6 Changes in pH (A) and Eh (B) of the service fluid with 1.25 and
2.68 g/L Fh loadings.

Figure 6B shows
the variance in Eh measurements of the system for both loadings. The
redox potential is influenced by changes in pH according to the Nernst
equation, and the two parameters have an inverse relationship. The
steep drop in pH followed by the introduction of Fh was mirrored by
a corresponding spike in Eh, and the subsequent pH recovery throughout
the remaining runtime was mirrored by a decrease in Eh. For each loading,
the extent of change in Eh was also proportional to the change in
pH, with the 2.61 g/L loading having a larger drop in pH and a larger
spike in Eh in comparison to the 1.21 g/L loading.

Batch Adsorption
For batch adsorption experiments,
Fh was added to beakers containing arsenite solution and stirred while
samples were taken over time. Figure 7A,B shows the removal of arsenite with 1.25 and 2.68
g/L loadings. The amount of arsenite remaining in the solution at
each point in time is presented as a mass fraction of the total arsenite
introduced initially. The amount of arsenite adsorbed onto Fh is calculated
using a mass balance on the total arsenite according to eq 2 as follows: CiVi is the initial mass of arsenite
in solution;  is the accumulated mass
removed from sampling; CmVf is the final mass remaining in solution;
and m is
the total number of samples. 2  

Figure 7 Removal of
arsenite in batch experiments over time for 1.25 (A)
and 2.68 g/L (B) adsorbent loadings. The amount of arsenite remaining
in solution is presented as a mass fraction of total arsenic.

In the experimental replicates, most of the arsenite
was removed
within 30 min. Additional reaction time minimally increased the overall
removal. For the 1.25 g/L loading, Table 1 shows that on average, 73% of the total
arsenite in solution was removed within 30 min and 82% within 3 h.
Thus, 89% of the arsenite was removed within that 30 min mark, leaving
11% to be adsorbed in 2.5 h. For the 2.68 g/L loading, Table 2 shows that on average, 94%
of the total arsenite and all arsenite that would be removed was removed
within 30 min. Raven et al., 1998 (ref (20)), also showed similar adsorption behavior, having
high initial removal in less than 30 min in 2 g/L Fh suspensions containing
40.01 and 2000.4 mg/L arsenite at pH 9.2. Li et al., 2011 (ref (22)), also reported 90% adsorption
within 1 h using a 0.25 g/L Fh loading in a 5 mg/L arsenite solution
at pH 7. Zhu et al., 2011 (ref (23)), attributed this behavior to a biphasic sorption process.
Working with a 5 g/L Fh loading in a 525 mg/L arsenite solution at
pH 6, it was noted that a fast, initial sorption process occurred
within 0.167 h (10 min), followed by a slower secondary sorption process.
Overall, these prior reports indicate that the adsorption process
of arsenite to Fh is fast (Table S3). Rapid
adsorption can have a profound effect on treatment processes, minimizing
both the required contact time (hydraulic retention time) and the
size of treatment systems (footprint).

Variation of pH and Eh over time
for the two Fh loadings is shown
in Figure 8A,B. As
observed in the system, there is large drop in pH and a large increase
in Eh. The changes in pH and Eh were inversely related and in proportion
to the loading of Fh. Unlike the dialysis system, the overall change
for both parameters was smoother and occurred over a longer period
without a recovery. This is likely a combined effect from the introduction
of Fh protons into water and from arsenite adsorption onto Fh. This
contention is further supported by other experiments from our laboratory
(Figure S1) where 1.25 g/L Fh was added
to a solution imitating the ionic strength and pH of the batch reactions
without arsenite. In this circumstance, the pH dropped sharply and
plateaued within 5 min.

removal with 1.25
and 2.68 g/L Fh loadings.

Comparison of Arsenite Removal by Dialysis to Batch Adsorption
Performance of the dialysis-based system in comparison to batch
adsorption was dependent on the Fh loading and the behavior of the
material over the treatment process. In both the dialysis system and
batch adsorption, higher Fh loadings resulted in greater removal efficiencies,
but batch adsorption was overall more efficient than the system. At
the lower 1.22 g/L adsorbent loading, the dialysis system had less
total arsenite in contrast to its batch counterpart, yet it removed
only 67% of the total arsenite in comparison to the 82% average removed
by batch adsorption. At the higher 2.61 g/L adsorbent loading, where
the total arsenite was similar in the dialysis system and in the batch
replicates, the system removed 91% of the total arsenite in comparison
to the average 94% removed by batch adsorption. Most of the arsenite
passed from the membrane lumen into the service fluid within the treatment
period according to Figure 5, and given that batch experiments showed adsorption to be
fast, differences in performance cannot be attributed to the unavailability
of arsenite for adsorption or an insufficient treatment time. Differences
are attributed to changes in dispersion of Fh over time within the
treatment mixtures. Figure 9A shows that Fh in both batch and dialysis system processes
is introduced as a distribution of particles generally well below
100 μm in cross section. These particles disperse in solution
into a fine colloidal suspension that should facilitate the fast adsorption
of arsenite. However, the adsorbent in the dialysis system undergoes
noticeable physical changes over the course of the treatment process.
As seen in Figure 9B, particles aggregate to a large size and can lodge in rough surfaces
within the body of the system. Dispersion of the adsorbent is reduced
and is easily noticed by an increase in translucency of the service
fluid. This phenomenon likely adversely affected the removal efficiency
of the 1.22 g/L system loading. The 2.61 g/L system loading was able
to maintain a high removal because of the excess Fh present that can
counteract the effect of particle aggregation. The addition of excess
adsorbent, however, underutilizes the material’s adsorption
capacity. The adsorption capacity of Fh can be calculated as a weight
percent by taking the ratio between the concentration of arsenic adsorbed
and the adsorbent loading. For the 1.22 and 2.61 g/L system loadings,
the adsorption capacity is 3.9 and 3.0% w/w, respectively, in comparison
to 6.5 and 3.2% w/w for batch adsorption. The adsorption capacity
for Fh in the literature has been reported between 2 and 20% (adapted
as w/w) and is heavily dependent on experimental conditions (Table S3).

(B) use in the dialysis
system for arsenite removal.

Dialytic System Implications and Design Improvements
The
dialysis system has demonstrated successful removal of arsenite
using nano-adsorbents. However, several modifications are needed to
improve the performance and overall reliability for industrial applications.
As previously mentioned, nanoparticles aggregate over time to sizes
several orders of magnitude higher than the original particle sizes
(Figure 8). The physical
structure of the system and formation of eddies entrap the adsorbent
particles into crevices and uneven surfaces and immobilize a fraction
of the adsorbent. Entrapment could be mitigated in part with improved
fluidic design but aggregation must also be addressed. One contributing
factor to aggregation may be the increased collision frequency between
nanoparticles due to flow shear forces. Flume experiments with CeO2 nanoparticles have demonstrated that shear forces during
flow increase z-average particle size over time as
analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS).37 Nanomaterials also have a natural tendency to aggregate because
of the instability of their surface charges, and the high ionic strength
service fluid may enhance this effect.38,39 Liu et al.,
2019 (ref (41)), investigated
the aggregation of the more crystalline six-line Fh (diameter ∼6
nm) using DLS and showed that the hydrodynamic radius increases more
dramatically over time in higher ionic strength conditions near neutral
pH. High salt solutions transmit ion charges, reduce electrostatic
repulsion, and lower the energy barrier needed for collisions to form
aggregates.40 This suggests that reducing
the ionic strength may serve to minimize aggregation, but may impose
limitations on the operating parameters under real-world conditions.
Some studies suggest that the incorporation of chemical additives
with strongly coordinating ligands, such as organic acids, into adsorbent
mixtures can suppress aggregation.41,42 Maintaining
a low ionic strength may limit additives that can be added to improve
performance of the nano-adsorbents and requires that the service solution
be protected from accumulating high concentrations of multivalent
metals or other treated species during operation. Even accounting
for these considerations, extended system runtimes result in a higher
number of particle collisions, which may nonetheless counteract these
adjustments. However, in an improved system, nano-adsorbents that
are exhausted (saturated with contaminants) over a longer contact
time can be replaced before aggregation becomes detrimental to performance.
The most significant advantage of the proposed design is that nano-adsorbents
are never in direct contact with treated or untreated water and can
be easily removed and replaced.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated the application of the hemodialyzer (renal dialysis)
design in using nano-adsorbents for water purification. Here, we used
two-line Fh for the removal of arsenite. These experiments have served
as a proof of concept for a new approach for applying nanomaterials
in fluidic purification. Traditional batch experiments were also conducted
to assess the removal efficiency, measure changes in Eh and pH, and
compare the results to those obtained from the proposed system. Finally,
Eh and pH values, at equilibrium, are approximately close for both
experiments; however, initial Eh and pH changes are dissimilar. This
is an important observation that should be considered in designing
an industrial-scale purification system with a short hydraulic retention
time. A comparison of the two methods showed that for similar adsorbent
loadings over the same runtime, the system removed 67 and 91% of arsenite,
while the batch method adsorbed 82 and 94%. Future studies improving
on the proposed design should focus on preventing eddy formation and
increasing the mass transfer rate, which can increase the removal
efficiency and lifetime of nano-adsorbents and reduce the required
hydraulic retention time.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis and Characterization
Methods of Fh
Fh was
synthesized using the SDM reported by Smith et al. (2012).26 Briefly, a 1:3 molar ratio of Fe(NO3)·9H2O (ACS grade, Acros) and NH4NO3 (98%, Acros) was continuously ground together using a mortar
and pestle until bubbling stopped, and a dark brown precipitate formed.
The precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 24 h, vacuum filtered,
rinsed with small volumes of reagent grade water, and dried again
for another 24 h. The material was ground to a fine dark brown powder
using a mortar and pestle before analysis and use in experiments.
All experiments were performed using the same single batch of Fh.

X-ray diffractograms for Fh were obtained using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE
diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406). The powder samples were scanned from 20 to 80°
2θ in 0.02° increments with a 1s dwell time. The FTIR absorbance
spectrum was obtained using a PerkinElmer ATR–FTIR 100 spectrometer
from 4000 to 650 cm–1. TEM micrographs were taken
using a JEOL JEM-1400 microscope. SEM micrographs were taken using
an FEI Quanta 450 FEG microscope operating at 30 kV. The surface area
of Fh was obtained using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 analyzer with degassing
at 100 °C for 4 h and calculated using the BET method.

Dialysis
System Experiments
The dialysis system was
set up as follows. A 100 kDa dialysis tube was clamped vertically
to a ring stand. A 600 mL beaker containing a stir bar was placed
atop a stirrer. Size 15 C-flex tubing was fitted into a Cole-Parmer
Masterflex L/S peristaltic pump with a high-performance pump head.
One end of the tubing was fixed to the bottom inlet of the dialysis
system, while the other end of the tube was placed inside the beaker.
Another piece of tubing was fixed to the top outlet of the dialysis
tube, and its free end was placed inside the beaker as well. Oxidation–reduction
potential and pH probes were fixed from the ring stand inside the
beaker to track changes in Eh and pH over time.

In preparation
for use, the dialysis membrane was primed to remove glycerin. A 10%
ethanol solution was used to both hand-fill the lumen of the membrane
and to pump solution continuously through the outer body for 15 min.
Similarly, several rinses with deionized water were used to remove
traces of ethanol from the membrane.

To start each experiment,
37 mL of pH 9.05 arsenite solution—prepared
from As2O3 powder—was added by hand into
the lumen of the membrane. A sample from the excess of this solution
was preserved with concentrated nitric acid and later analyzed to
determine the initial arsenic concertation. Then, a 250 mL service
solution containing a NaNO3 ionic strength of 0.25 and
a pH of 9.05 was prepared in the 600 mL beaker. An initial 5 mL sample
was taken, and Fh was added into the beaker to attain 1.22 or 2.61
g/L loading (by total system volume). The service solution was continuously
stirred, slowly pumped from the bottom to the top to fill the system,
and then set at a flow rate of 300 mL/min. Over the course of 3 h,
samples were taken from the beaker, filtered through a 0.45 μm
PTFE syringe filter, acidified with concentrated nitric acid to a
pH below 2, and refrigerated for preservation. Changes in pH and Eh
of the service fluid were also tracked over the runtime of each experiment.
At the end of the experiment, a sample was taken from the lumen of
the membrane to determine the final arsenite concentration after treatment.
Arsenite concentration in samples was analyzed using a Thermo Scientific
iCAP Q inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer operated by Alpha
Analytical, Inc. following EPA Method 200.8 for total arsenic analysis.
Solutions in the membrane lumen had initial arsenite concentrations
of 545.5 and 679.5 mg/L for the 1.22 and 2.61 g/L Fh loadings, respectively.

Batch Experiments
Arsenite adsorption by Fh was evaluated
with 1.25 and 2.68 g/L Fh loadings in two separate experiments. In
each case, four 280 mL arsenite solutions—prepared from As2O3 powder—were adjusted to an ionic strength
of 0.22 using NaNO3 and set to an initial pH of 9.05 using
NaOH and HNO3. An initial 5 mL sample was taken from each
solution, quickly filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter,
acidified with concentrated nitric acid to a pH below 2, and refrigerated
for preservation. Fh was introduced into three of the solutions, while
the fourth remained as a control. The solutions were continuously
stirred atop a multistirrer at 600 rpm. Over the course of 3 h, the
solutions were sampled every half hour and samples were processed
as described above. In between sampling periods, the solutions were
covered to prevent evaporation. Changes in pH and Eh of one of the
noncontrol solutions were also tracked over the runtime of each experiment
using pH and redox probes. Solutions with the 1.25 g/L adsorbent loading
had initial arsenic concentrations of 74.4 and 111.6 mg/L and the
control system had an initial arsenic concentration of 65.6 mg/L.
Solutions with the 2.68 g/L adsorbent loading had initial arsenic
concentrations of 88.4, 91.5, and 96.1 mg/L, and the control system
initial arsenite concentration was 92.7 mg/L.
