Interactions
between transmembrane (TM) helices play a critical
role in the fundamental processes required for cells to communicate
and exchange materials with their surroundings. Our understanding
of the factors that promote TM helix interactions has greatly benefited
from our ability to study these interactions in the solution phase
through the use of membrane-mimetic micelles. However,
less is known about the potential influence of juxtamembrane regions
flanking the interacting TM helices that may modulate dimerization
affinities, even when the interacting surface itself is not altered.
To investigate this question, we used solution NMR to quantitate the
dimerization affinity of the major coat protein from the M13 bacteriophage
in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a well-characterized model of a single-spanning
self-associating TM protein. Here,
we showed that a shorter construct lacking the N-terminal amphipathic
helix has a higher dimerization affinity relative to that of the full-length
protein, with no change in the helical structure between the monomeric
and dimeric states in both cases. Although this translated into a
0.6 kcal/mol difference in free energy when the SDS solvent was approximated
as a continuous phase, there were deviations from this model at high
protein to detergent ratios. Instead, the equilibria were better fit
to a model that treats the empty micelle as an active participant
in the reaction, giving rise to standard free energies of association
that were the same for both full-length and TM-segment constructs.
According to this model, the higher apparent affinity of the shorter
peptide could be completely explained by the enhanced detergent binding
by the monomer relative to that bound by the dimer. Therefore, differential
detergent binding between the monomeric and dimeric states provides
a mechanism by which TM helix interactions can be modulated by noninteracting
juxtamembrane regions.

Introduction
A large fraction of eukaryotic membrane
proteins are bitopic, with
one transmembrane (TM) segment typically acting as a membrane anchor
for large interacting extramembraneous domains.1,2 However,
interactions also occur between TM segments themselves in a wide range
of biological processes, as seen in the activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases,3 assembly of cell adhesion receptors,4 and in the formation of ion-conducting channels.5 High-resolution structures of these oligomeric
states have provided insights into how these associations occur and
how they may be regulated or disrupted.6 These structures were often facilitated by the ability of detergent
micelles to reconstitute functionally relevant oligomers under conditions
that are compatible with solution NMR.7,8 These conditions
have also provided a means to measure TM helix association affinities
because in many cases distinct peaks can be observed for each oligomeric
species in the NMR spectrum and intensities can be quantitated to
determine relative populations.9−16 These studies have
provided insights into the determinants of both stronger and weaker
TM helix interactions, with a significant number of them being nucleated
by the GXXXG motif that allows intimate backbone contacts across the
interface.17−19

One of the model systems that has been extensively
used to characterize
GXXXG-mediated dimerization is the 50-residue major coat protein (MCP)
from the Ff family of filamentous bacteriophage,20 containing a single TM segment. Approximately 2700 copies
of MCP encapsulate the single-stranded bacteriophage genome, and are
stably inserted into the bacterial inner membrane during infection.21,22 Newly synthesized MCP is also incorporated into the membrane, where
it is stored before its assembly into new bacteriophage. Dimerization
via the GXXXG motif has been shown to occur in bacterial membranes23 in an interaction that has also been extensively
characterized in detergent micelles.24−27 The ability of sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) micelles to preserve these dimers has greatly facilitated
these studies, with SDS-PAGE analysis showing a broad band distributed
between the monomeric and dimeric states for the wild-type protein,
providing a convenient method to identify mutations that alter this
equilibrium.

More recently, peptide models of the MCP TM segment
have been synthesized,
facilitating the study of dimerization using fluorescent labels.28 Interestingly, SDS-PAGE analysis of these peptides
revealed a greater tendency for dimer formation when compared with
that of the full-length protein, suggesting that changes in the MCP
sequence outside of the TM segment can alter the affinity of the dimer.
The magnitude of this effect has not been measured, nor has its origin
been determined. However, it is known that the amphipathic helix interacts
with the surface of the micelle, in a nanosecond timescale exchange
between the bound and free states,29−33 raising the possibility that this interaction could
influence the energetics of TM helix association.

To investigate
the influence of the amphipathic helix on TM helix
association in MCP, we have characterized the secondary structure
of the monomeric and dimeric states of full-length MCP and its TM
segment alone (MCPTM) in SDS micelles and confirmed that
its helical structure is minimally altered by dimerization. We have
also used solution NMR to quantitate the energy of this association
and found that the standard free energy in 1 M micellar SDS was 0.6
kcal/mol lower for the peptide relative to that of full-length MCP.
However, SDS micelles did not act as an ideal solvent when higher
protein-to-detergent ratios were used, with the affinities being affected
by the concentration of empty micelles, suggesting that the empty
micelle is an active participant in the monomer–dimer exchange
reaction. When standard free
energies were calculated with the empty micelle as a participant,
the free energy of association between the full-length and TM-peptide
MCP was found to be equivalent. This analysis revealed that the increase
in apparent affinity that is observed for the TM peptide can be attributed
to a larger number of detergent molecules in the protein–detergent
complex (PDC) for the monomer relative to that for the dimer or protein-free
micelle. Therefore, differences in the detergent-binding properties
between the monomeric and dimeric state species, and having no changes
in the inherent ability of TM segments to interact, account for the
change in the affinity of TM helix self-association for MCP in SDS.

Materials
and Methods
MCP and MCPTM Sample Preparation
M13 bacteriophage
was propagated as previously described34 in Escherichia coli K38A cells (HfC+,
T2R, relA1, pit-10, spoT1, ton A22, ompF627, phoA4, T2Rƛ1)35 in M9 minimal media36 supplemented with a 1× Gibco MEM vitamin solution, where 10%
(w/v) 15NH4Cl and 30% (w/v) 13C-labeled
glucose were provided as nitrogen and carbon sources for homogenous 15N- and 13C-labeling. Selectively 15N-valine-labeled bacteriophage was produced in the auxotrophic G11a1
strain of E. coli as previously described,37 where 15N-labeled valine was added
to a final concentration of 100 mg/L. The bacteriophage was isolated
as previously described,38 and MCP was
extracted from the bacteriophage using phenol extraction.34,39 RP-HPLC was carried out on the phenol fraction with an aqueous 30%–100%
(v/v) acetonitrile gradient with 0.01% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid
at a rate of 2% per min on an Agilent C3 semipreparative column. The
peak corresponding to the MCP eluted at ∼60% acetonitrile,
and the collected fractions were lyophilized and solubilized in aqueous
SDS, pH 5.5, just before analysis.

A peptide composed of MCP
residues 21–48 was synthesized by CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale,
CA) with 15N-labeled valine, glycine, and leucine for a
total of 12 labeled amino acids spanning the dimeric interface (MCPTM). Three non-native lysine residues were included at the
N-terminus, and the C-terminus was amidated to increase the peptide
solubility.40 Protein and peptide concentrations
were determined in duplicate using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay (Pierce Biotech). Peptide sequences are shown in Table 1.

CD Spectroscopy
Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra
were recorded on a Jasco-810 instrument with 0.1 mM MCP in SDS, pH
5.5, under the detergent–protein molar ratios that favored
either the monomer or the dimer. Eight scans were performed from 250
to 200 nm, with a step resolution of 0.2 nm, a speed of 20 nm/min,
a bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a response time of 2 s, using a 0.1 mm
path length quartz cuvette.

NMR Spectroscopy
1H–15N HSQC spectra were acquired for the measurement of monomer
and dimer
populations on 0.7–1 mM 15N-labeled MCP or 0.5 mM
selectively 15N-labeled MCPTM, in 10% D2O with 50–500 mM SDS, pH 5.5, 37 °C using the
500 MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer at the University of Ottawa Faculty
of Science NMR Facility.
Experiments were typically carried out using 32 transients, 128 increments,
a 1H spectral width of 7017.4 Hz, and a 15N
spectral width of 1267.2 Hz. An interscan delay of 4 s was used in
experiments measuring equilibrium populations of the monomeric and
dimeric states. NMRPipe was used to process the spectra and measure
peak volumes with its nlinLS module.41

Approximately 0.8 mM 15N-/13C-labeled full-length
MCP was dissolved in 100 mM SDS and 10% D2O, pH 5.5, for
chemical shift assignment experiments carried out at the Health Canada
NMR facility on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer. These included
HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and 15N-HSQC-NOESY (with 100 ms mixing
time) spectra. Assignments were made in NMRView.42 Average backbone amide chemical shift differences (Δδ)
between the monomeric and dimeric forms of MCP were calculated as
Δδ = ((ΔδHN)2 + (ΔδN/5)2)0.5, where ΔδHN and ΔδN are the chemical shift differences
between the monomeric and dimeric species for the amide proton and
nitrogen atoms, respectively.

Diffusion Coefficient Measurements
To measure the diffusion
coefficient (Ds) values of selectively 15N-valine-labeled full-length MCP, the bipolar-gradient-pulse-pair
longitudinal-eddy-current-delay (RAW-BPP-LED) sequence was utilized.43 The length of the position-encoding gradients
(δ) was 1.2 ms, and the duration of the diffusion delay (T) was 100 ms. At each gradient strength, 1024 transients
were accumulated, with an interscan time delay of 2 s. The fraction
(fz) of the maximal gradient strength
(Gmax = 69.9 G cm–1)
was increased by 2% increments from 4% to 90%, queued in a randomized
sequence to reduce systematic errors. Spectra were analyzed using
VNMR (Agilent), the intensities (I) of the resolved
peaks were determined by integration, and the standard error was determined
from duplicate experiments. Intensities were plotted against the fraction
gradient strength, which gives a monoexponential decay that was fit
to 1  where the reference intensity Io(fo) was measured at fo = 0.02 and the delay following each gradient
pulse (τ) was 0.2 ms.

Standard Free Energy Calculations
Apparent
Free Energy of Association
Concentrations
of the monomeric and dimeric species ([M] and [D], respectively) were
determined from the peak intensities in 1H–15N HSQC spectra and used to calculate an apparent equilibrium
constant for the TM helix association in micelles 2  which
can be used to calculate an apparent
free energy of association 3  

Standard Free Energy of Association in a
Continuous Detergent
Phase
The associating polypeptides are confined to the micellar
phase which, in previous calculations of TM helix association free
energies, has been approximated as a continuous phase.44 According to this model, the equilibrium constant
for the association reaction depends on the effective concentration
of each species in the micellar phase, giving rise to a detergent-concentration-normalized
expression for the equilibrium constant 4  where
[SDS]Micellar is the concentration
of micellar SDS. This allows the calculation of a standard free energy
of association under standard conditions of 1 M micellar detergent
as 5  If the fraction of the dimer population (fd) is 6  then
the relationship between the molar ratio
of monomeric MCP to SDS (nM/nSDS) and fd is given by 7  

Standard Free Energy of
Association in Micelles
A more
recent model for association suggesting that the empty micelle (Micempty) is an active participant in dimer dissociation has been
proposed.9 According to this model, the
free energy of dimerization would be based on  

As has been
suggested in the previous
models that treated the total micellar detergent as a continuous phase,9,45,46 the amount of detergent that
is associated with the monomeric and dimeric PDCs may differ and may
also be larger or smaller than the number of detergent molecules contained
in an empty micelle. This is recognized in the empty micelle model,9 where the amount of detergent that is released
upon dimerization may not be the same as the amount of detergent required
to make up the empty micelle, which can be represented by
a modified equilibrium  where f is the fraction of
empty micelle aggregation number (e) 8  and m and d are the number of detergent molecules
associated with the monomeric
and dimeric PDCs, respectively. In the case where the amount of detergent
released in the dimerization reaction is less than e, f will be a negative number. According to this
model,9 the equilibrium for association
is given by 9  where the concentration of empty micelles
is 10  This gives a free energy of association under
standard conditions of 1 M empty micelles (ΔGmicelleo) as 11  A plot of ΔGapp versus ln[Micempty], therefore, should
give rise to a
straight line if the dimerization follows this model.

Results
and Discussion
NMR of the MCP Monomer–Dimer Equilibrium
in SDS
As has previously been observed,15,24,47−49 when MCP is solubilized
in SDS,
several residues show two peaks in the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum, with the relative intensity of each peak being affected
by the molar ratio of the micellar detergent to protein (Figure 1a). These two peaks
correspond to a monomeric and a dimeric state, with the monomer being
favored as the detergent-to-protein ratio is increased. For this 0.8
mM 15N-/13C-labeled MCP sample solubilized in
100 mM SDS, the peak-intensity ratios of the two species indicate
that 42 ± 2% of the population exists in the dimeric state. This
sample was used to obtain backbone chemical shifts for both species,
building on previous studies on the 15N-labeled MCP that
assigned well-resolved doublets for a subset of TM segment residues.24

the monomeric and dimeric states, respectively.

Average backbone amide chemical shift differences were observed
between the monomer and the dimer over the entire length of the TM
segment until the second-last residue (Figure 2a), with the exception of Phe45, for which
only one peak was observed. Secondary Cα shift analysis showed
that the secondary structure of the two states was indistinguishable
(Figure 2b), with a
helix predicted for residues 6–19 and 26–45, in line
with previous observations on the monomer.24,29,49 This was confirmed
by CD spectroscopy on MCP recorded under conditions that favored dimeric
states over monomeric states, with superimposable spectra obtained
in each case (Figure 3). Therefore, the dimerization of MCP does not give rise to any change
in the secondary structure, similar to other self-associating TM helix
systems.50,51

Because MCP is restricted to the
micellar detergent phase, equilibrium
populations of the monomer and the dimer can be altered by changing
the molar ratio of micellar SDS to MCP ([SDS]m:[MCP]).
Assuming that micelles can be approximated as a continuous detergent
phase, free energies of association can be calculated relative to
a standard state of 1 M micellar SDS (ΔGo).44 For this purpose, peak intensities
were measured for well-resolved doublets in the MCP spectrum (i.e.,
Ile22, Trp26, Met28, Ala35, Val33, Thr36, Thr46, and Lys48) over a
range of [SDS]m:[MCP] values, giving rise to a ΔGo of −2.7 kcal/mol (Figure 4). This is a small interaction
energy relative to those measured for other TM helix interactions
in micelles,51 consistent with our inability
to isolate a purely dimeric state under the concentrations that are
accessible for this protein in SDS.

equilibrium (eq 7), with
a standard free energy of association of −2.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol
(MCP) or −3.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (MCPTM).

Comparison of the Dimerization
Affinity for Full-Length MCP
versus MCPTM
To evaluate the impact of the amphipathic
helix on MCP dimerization, a similar series of experiments were also
performed on a synthetic peptide containing MCP TM segment residues
21–48, with the 15N isotope incorporated into the
backbone of glycine, alanine, valine, and leucine (MCPTM). Similar to the full-length MCP, 1H–15N HSQC spectra of MCPTM showed two peaks for each residue,
with relative intensities that depend on [SDS]m:[MCPTM] (Figure 1B). On the basis of the populations determined from the NMR spectra
at different [SDS]m:[MCPTM] values, the standard
free energy of this interaction was found to be −3.3 kcal/mol
(Figure 4), a small
but significant increase in the dimerization affinity relative to
that of the full-length protein. Its CD spectrum also showed no significant
change in the secondary structure under conditions that favored the
monomeric or dimeric states, with characteristic spectra for the α-helical
structure (Figure 3). Therefore, the enhanced dimerization affinity of the peptide over
the full-length protein cannot be explained by differences in the
secondary structure between the monomeric and dimeric states.

Our ability to use the measured ΔGo values to quantitate the effect of the removal of amphipathic helix
on TM helix affinity relies on the validity of the continuous detergent
phase model used to calculate these values. According to this model,
the apparent affinity constant (Kapp)
will change with [SDS]m:[protein] but can be effectively
normalized by multiplying Kapp by the
concentration of micellar SDS. However, for both full-length and TM-peptide
MCP, the detergent-normalized Kapp was
constant only at higher [SDS]m:[protein] values (Figure 5). At lower mole
ratios, the detergent-concentration-normalized affinity constants
increased with decreasing [SDS]m:[protein] values. In spite
of the widespread use of the continuum model in the calculation of
TM helix association free energies, this analysis suggests that it
is not appropriate for the characterization of MCP TM helix interactions
in SDS micelles.

Potential Causes for the
Nonideality of SDS as a Solvent
A potential source of the
enhanced dimerization observed for MCP
at lower [SDS]m:[protein] values is a change in the size
of the PDC. To evaluate this possibility, we measured the translational
diffusion coefficients of the PDC by solution NMR using MCP samples
that were selectively labeled with 15N-valine, allowing
the monomeric and dimeric species for Val33 to be distinguished in
a 1D spectrum. Samples were prepared under either low or high [SDS]m:[protein] conditions, and 15N-edited pulse field
gradient echo experiments were performed to measure the translational
diffusion coefficients.43,52 As shown in Figure 6, at low [SDS]m:[protein] conditions that give rise to deviations from the
continuum approximation of the SDS solvent, the measured diffusion
coefficients were indistinguishable between the monomeric and dimeric
states. Moreover, when MCP was diluted to favor the monomeric state,
the translational self-diffusion coefficient did not change. Therefore,
large changes in the size of the PDC do not appear to account for
the observed deviations from the continuum model.

decay of normalized MCP peak intensities.

are fits to eq 1 using
the translational diffusion coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10–6 cm2 s–1.

One factor that may help explain the nonideal behavior
observed
for MCP self-association in SDS is the slow rate of exchange between
the monomeric and dimeric states on the NMR timescale. On the basis
of the smallest chemical shift difference measured between the two
states, the rate constant for exchange must be slower than 25 s–1. To understand the origin of the slow exchange kinetics
in this weak interaction, it is useful to consider the mechanism by
which TM helices associate and dissociate when encapsulated in micelles
(Figure 7). Whereas
the series of kinetically resolvable steps that are involved in the
dimerization of micelle-solubilized peptides is not known, this mechanism
likely involves collisions between micelles, with a fraction of these
collisions causing the transfer of single polypeptides between micelles
to produce a PDC containing two polypeptides. In the hypothetical
scheme shown in Figure 7, this could involve micelle fusion followed by some process that
restores the micelle size to its equilibrium state, either in a single
micelle fission event or through gradual loss of detergent to the
solution and/or other micelles. In cases where micelle fusion gives
rise to a PDC containing two polypeptides, dimer formation between
the two TM segments could proceed.

Figure 7 Hypothetical scheme depicting the exchange
between the monomeric
and dimeric states for TM helices in a micellar system. Light and
dark blue bars indicate species that would give rise to peaks in the
NMR spectrum that would be assigned as the monomeric and dimeric species,
respectively, according to the two different models used for free
energy calculations. The continuous solvent model assumes that there
is a rapid exchange of peptides between micelles, whereas the empty
micelle model would be characterized by slow rates of micelle fission/fusion
relative to polypeptide association/dissociation rates. In the empty
micelle model, the peak assigned as the dimer would actually be an
equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric species.

Although speculative, this scheme highlights two
events that could
account for the slow (on the NMR timescale) rate of exchange: (i)
polypeptide transfer between micelles and (ii) helix association.
In the continuum model used to calculate standard free energies, helix
association rates are assumed to be much slower than the rates of
polypeptide transfer between micelles. However, if this is not the
case, the polypeptide transfer may instead be the rate-determining
step. According to this scenario, the exchange between the monomeric
and dimeric MCP could be fast on the NMR timescale, such that the
species that we have assigned as dimeric in the NMR spectrum would
actually represent a mixture of monomeric and dimeric states, with
the chemical shift appearing at the population-weighted average of
the two states. This would give rise to an overestimation of the population
of dimeric MCP and therefore overestimate the affinity of self-association.

An important consequence of a slow polypeptide transfer between
micelles is that distinct peaks for the monomeric state would appear
only in the NMR spectrum for PDCs containing a single polypeptide.
Although it is not known how the exchange between the monomer- and
dimer-containing PDCs actually occurs, it may involve fusion of a
PDC containing two polypeptides, with an “empty” micelle
that contains no polypeptide. This model was recently proposed by
the Arseniev group,9 building on Wyman’s
theory of linkages53 tailored to the specific
case of interacting micelle-bound proteins.46 According to this model, the affinity of dimerization depends on
the concentration of empty micelles, which would become limiting at
low detergent-to-protein ratios. This predicts a linear relationship
between ΔGapp and ln[Micempty], where the slope allows determination of the amount of detergent
released by the dimerization reaction and the intercept gives the
standard free energy of association in a 1 M solution of micelles
(ΔGmicelleo).

As shown in Figure 8, when this analysis was performed for MCP
and MCPTM,
there was a linear relationship between the apparent free energy and
ln[Micempty] in both cases. A similar relationship has
also been observed for self-association of the TM segment from the
fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) in a 9:1 mixture of DPC:SDS
and the vascular endothelium growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in
DPC,9 suggesting that this is a common
feature of TM-segment interactions in micelles.

as a reactant. Apparent free energy of association vs ln[Micempty] (aggregation numbers in Table 2) for MCP (blue) and MCPTM (red).

Differential Detergent Binding Accounts for
Differences in Apparent
Dimer Affinities
Because the concentration of empty micelles
depends on the number of detergent molecules in each micelle species,
it is possible to extract detergent aggregation numbers from this
analysis. As shown in Table 2, the number of detergent molecules that make up the PDC for
monomeric MCP (m) is approximately the same as for
dimeric MCP (d). By contrast, there were a larger
number of detergent molecules in the PDC containing a single MCPTM peptide, whereas aggregation numbers for the dimer and empty
micelles (e) were found to be similar to those determined
for full-length MCP. Consequently, dimer formation by the TM peptide
is accompanied by a release of detergent that exceeds the amount required
to form one empty micelle. This imbalance in detergent aggregation
numbers increases the amount of detergent required to form the monomeric
PDC for MCPTM relative to full-length MCP, shifting the
equilibrium toward the dimeric state for a given detergent–protein
ratio. This appears to completely account for the enhanced affinity
seen for MCPTM relative to that for the full-length protein
because ΔGmicelleo is the same as for both full-length
and TM peptide systems (Table 2). Therefore, the apparent difference in affinity between
the full-length and peptide MCP can be attributed exclusively to differences
in the detergent-binding propensities between the two systems.

To determine whether this differential detergent-binding behavior
is a general characteristic of the MCPTM peptide, we performed
the same analysis on data that had been previously acquired on MCPTM with mutations introduced that would increase dimerization
affinity (M28L/V31L).15 As shown in Table 2, ΔGmicelleo for
M28L/V31L is lower than that of the WT MCPTM by ∼0.3
kcal/mol, a difference in free energy similar to the difference determined
by the continuum model. Similar detergent-binding parameters were
obtained for wild-type and mutant MCPTM peptides, with
an excess of detergent being released in the dimerization reaction.
This suggests that the regions of the polypeptide outside of the TM
segment determine the detergent-binding properties of these complexes.

The fact that our data could be fit to a model that treats the
empty micelle as a reactant in the equilibrium provides evidence that
micelle fusion/fission is rate-determining in the equilibrium that
is monitored by NMR. Although the actual rates for SDS micelle fusion/fission
in our system are not known, they are predicted to be slow based on
the electrostatic repulsion that is anticipated to occur between the
SDS headgroups of the colliding micelles. This is substantiated by
fluorescence decay rates measured for the dilution of Triton-solubilized
pyrene-labeled triglyceride into SDS,54 which were found to be very slow (e.g., ∼0.01 s–1 in 100 mM NaCl at 23 °C). This is even slower than the macroscopic
exchange rates estimated for MCP in SDS micelles, where micelle fusion/fission
rates may have been accelerated by the incorporation of the MCP polypeptide
into the micelle.

Implications for TM Helix Association
The original
purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the MCP amphipathic
helix on TM helix association. Our results show a clear difference
in the apparent affinity between TM and full-length MCP sequences
and showed that this difference can be attributed to protein–detergent
interactions that differ between the monomeric and dimeric species
that enhance the dimer affinity of the TM peptide. This may reflect
the influence of the amphipathic helix on the PDC size, with the interaction
between the micelle and amphipathic helix potentially helping to keep
the aggregation number of the PDC constant between micelles. However,
it is also possible that the three non-native lysine residues added
to the N-terminus of the TM peptides to facilitate handling was responsible
for the increase in detergent aggregation numbers for the PDCs containing
a single peptide. Interactions between sulfate headgroups and amine
side chains could stabilize a larger PDC in the monomeric state, with
steric effects potentially hindering these interactions in the dimer,
thereby reducing its PDC size relative to that of the monomer.

Evidence that juxtamembrane regions can influence the apparent affinity
of TM helix interactions through differential detergent binding is
supported by previous studies examining the amount of detergent released
in the self-association of micelle-encapsulated TM segments, although
those analyses did not differentiate between empty and protein-bound
micelles. In contrast to our results on MCP, self-association of the
TM helix of glycophorin A (GpA) in SDS released significantly less
detergent than is needed to form a stable protein-free micelle.45 However, the opposite trend was observed for
the GpA interaction when measured in a series of phosphocholine-based
alkyl detergents, with more detergent being released than that needed
to form a single protein-free micelle. This was more pronounced as
the detergent alkyl chain decreased, with greater excess micelles
being released and correspondingly higher dimer affinities being measured
in phosphocholine detergents of decreasing alkyl chain length.55 In this series, the change in alkyl chain length
changes the micelle size, potentially affecting the region of the
peptide that interacts with the detergent headgroup. These interactions
could give rise to differences in sizes of monomer- versus dimer-containing
PDCs in a way that can disrupt or promote TM helix association.

Conclusions
We performed a thermodynamic investigation of
MCP TM helix self-association
and found that the apparent affinity of the TM segment in SDS micelles
is higher when the N-terminal amphipathic helix is replaced by a trilysine
tag. This difference in apparent affinity could be explained by differential
detergent–protein interactions between PDCs containing one
versus two MCP polypeptides. When this was taken into account, it
was found that there was no difference in TM helix association energy
between the full-length and TM-peptide MCP. Our findings help explain
the differences in migration behavior seen for MCP versus the TM peptide
in SDS-PAGE gels that reflected the increase in apparent dimerization
affinity of the peptide25,40 and also highlight
the influence of the micellar state of the detergents used to measure
the free energies of interaction.
