Also we would like to add a few points
in our Conclusion section:

Schnoerr et al. have derived an exact
solution of the chemical
master equation for the enzyme reaction system (Appendix G in J. Chem. Phys.2014, 141,
024103) described by Figure 1 (a) in our manuscript. They have used
the mathematical formulation as shown by Stefanini et al. (ref 17
in our original paper) to calculate the average number of substrate
molecules and the variance in fluctuations in the average. In our
work we have used the same mathematical method to obtain the reaction
velocity and the variance. But we apply this theoretical approach
not only for the scheme described in Figure 1 (a) but also for other
catalytic reaction schemes that involve both substrate input and output
from the intracellular compartment as well as reaction schemes with
multiple intermediate states. In ref 17 the deviation from the MM
equation was shown only for a simple catalytic reaction with substrate
input (Figure 1(a)). In our work, we have extended this approach to
a few more reaction schemes and also discussed the conditions where
one can get back the MM like equation. We also study the coefficient
of variation, which is a measure of the noise strength as a function
of the mean substrate concentration for such reaction schemes where
there is influx or/and outflux of substrate molecules. From our calculations,
we compare the noise strength for both unidirectional and bidirectional
transport of substrate molecules. We also compare the level of noise
for enzymatic schemes with one and two intermediate states.

The authors apologize for overlooking these references in the original
paper.
