High
molar masses homopolymers of both acrylamide (AM) and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate
(AMPS) as well as poly(AM-stat-AMPS) exhibiting a
large range copolymer composition has been obtained via the optimization
of a purely adiabatic gel process. Monomer concentrations ranging
from 2.0 to 3.47 M have been successfully tested while keeping the
control of the molar masses up to 5 × 106 g mol–1. The products have been characterized in terms of
molecular mass and viscosimetric properties.

Introduction
Polyacrylamides (PAMs) exhibit strong
hydrogen bonding and water
solubility, and the most interesting about this polymer is associated
with its properties that lead to a multitude of uses in diverse industries.
PAMs act as primary flocculants or coagulants in water clarification
and mining application.1 They are useful
in the paper industry and may be used as flooding aids in secondary
oil recovery from the producing oil well.2 Other applications include agriculture, textile, and cosmetics.
Acrylamide-based (AM-based) monomers are known for their high polymerizability
properties, which rank them as top-grade candidates for the synthesis
of ultrahigh molecular weight (co)polymers.3 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate (AMPS) is a hydrosoluble and
reactive acrylamide-based monomer, having the potential to improve
the main chain stability in harsh environments such as temperature
and salinity.4 The ultrahigh molecular
weight (UHMW) polyacrylamide-based polymer are industrially obtained
via conventional radical polymerization resulting in large molar mass
distribution5 that may affect the final
properties.

Reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP)6 is a synthetic route that yields functional polymers
with controlled architecture and narrow molar mass distribution. The
control of polymerization is provided via a reversible capping and
de-capping of the growing (radical) polymer chain. During the process,
the concentration of the growing radical species is low enough to
consider the termination reaction negligible. The three most effective
RDRPs include nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP),7−10 atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),11 and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)12 polymerization. The macromolecular design by
the interchange of xanthate (MADIX)13,14 process may
be assimilated to the RAFT system by using xanthates as a chain agent
transfer.

All these approaches have been optimized by several
groups for
the synthesis of UHMW homo- and copolymers of acrylamides in the aqueous
phase. So far, aqueous phase NMP leads to the synthesis of polyacrylamide
(PAM) with a limited range of molar masses,10 that is, below 1 × 105 g mol–1. Higher molar masses, up to 5.9 × 105 g mol–1, were reached by using ATRP for the polymerization
of different acrylamide-based monomers mediated by tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine
(Me6TREN)/CuCl as a catalyst.15 In both cases, the control of polymerization was kept and the dispersities
remained below 1.5 even for the highest molar masses. The RAFT process
remains the controlled polymerization route in which the highest polyacrylamide
molar masses are obtained. Recently, UHMW has been obtained via photomediated-RAFT
polymerization. Homopolymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) have been obtained and controlled by a
trithiocarbonate (TCT) or a xanthate iniferter using a UV light source.
The reaction mixture volumes of few milliliters as well as the limited
monomer concentration (from 1 to 2 M) have been studied. Molar masses
reaching 8.57 × 106 g mol–1 and
dispersities below 1.2 were obtained.16

However, for economic reasons, the polymerization of acrylamide
in a concentration as high as possible has been desired as well as
a better control of the macromolecular size and composition to target
a specific physicochemical behavior. Considering the acrylamide monomer,
its polymerization in an aqueous solution at a concentration above
10 wt %, is accompanied by the formation of a gel reaction medium
while polymerization is being performed. Read et al. took advantage
of this feature to perform the gel polymerization of acrylamides while
controlling the molar masses by using the RAFT/MADIX.17 UHMW of polyacrylamides has been obtained by controlling
the reaction temperature via a thermostated bath at low temperature.
The MADIX system allows the synthesis of homopolymers and copolymers
of acrylamide (AM) with molar masses above 1 × 106 g mol–1 while keeping the distribution below 1.55.
However, the limited range of copolymer composition have been obtained,
as an example, copolymers of AM and up to 25 mol % of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid sodium salt (AMPS) were elaborated.

Our work proposes an
innovative alternative in terms of processes
and materials as compared to the previous works. Our strategy was
to obtain ultrahigh molar masses of homopolymers of both AM and AMPS
as well as poly(AM-stat-AMPS) copolymers exhibiting
a large range of [AM]/[AMPS] ratio, with the RAFT/MADIX gel from conventional
to purely adiabatic gel processes. As compared to polymers obtained
by Read et al.17 under a conventional gel
process (CGP), we were able to extend the copolymer composition. Taking
advantage of the sulfonated comonomer and the synthesis of a high
molar mass copolymer, the viscosimetric behavior in aqueous salt solution
of the copolymers poly(AM-stat-AMPS) and poly(AMPS)
has been studied. Our results obtained via the adiabatic RAFT/MADIX
gel process met the industrial expectation in terms of experimental
conditions, such as the product can be handled as a solid and the
energy required to synthesize and dry the product is reduced, and
polymer specifications by controlling both the macromolecular dimensions
and compositions.

Results and Discussion
All polymerization
processes have been performed simultaneously
in the conventional gel process (CGP) and in the adiabatic gel process
(AGP) by RAFT/MADIX (co)polymerization, and the results are compared
(Table 1).

a All the polymers have been processed
using PAM7-X as a transfer agent, but entry #1 was obtained
with Rhodixan and entries #2 and #3 with PAMPS50-X.

While Destarac et al.17 obtained statistical
copolymers of AM and AMPS with 0 and 25 mol % of AMPS with the CGP
conducted at 10 °C, this work first extends the synthesis strategy
to obtain the whole range of copolymer composition, that is, with
0, 5, 25, 70, and 100 mol % of AMPS (Table 1).

All the conditions have been reported
in Table 1 with the
molar masses and dispersities in
the Experimental Section. The lowest PAMPS
molar mass was obtained using Rhodixan as the transfer agent in the
alcoholic reaction medium (Table 1, entry 1). This low molar mass polymer exhibits a
polymerization degree of 50 (as obtained by 1H NMR analysis) and is
in accordance with the molar mass obtained via the SEC analysis and
reported in Table 1. It is called PAMPS50-X and has been employed as the RAFT transfer
agent to perform homopolymers of AMPS of higher molar masses (Table 1, entries 2 and 3).
Due to the hydrophilic nature of the PAMPS50-X agent, the
polymerization reactions have been performed in a purely aqueous medium,
and ammonium persulfate (APS) has been used as the initiator. The
control of the [AMPS]0/[PAMPS50-X]/[APS] ratios
allowed the synthesis of PAMPS exhibiting molar masses of 3 ×
106 and 10 × 106 g mol–1 and dispersities below 1.3 and above 95% conversion. Moreover, the
molar masses are in accordance with the expected theoretical (M̅n(th)) values calculated from the eq 1 where mM and mRAFT are the molar
masses of the monomer and RAFT agent, respectively, d is the number of radicals formed from the initiator, and f is the initiator efficiency and was taken equal to 0.7. 1  

In a last
attempt (Table 1, entry
4), a fourth PAMPS has been performed using PAM7-X as the
transfer agent, an oligomer of AM containing seven
monomer units. The experimental conditions of PAMPS obtained previously
(Table 2, entry 2)
have been reproduced. The results showed that the polymer exhibits
the same molar mass and dispersity either with PAMPS50-X
of PAM7-X, all other conditions remain the same. Therefore,
all other polymers have been performed using the PAM7-X
agent in the purely aqueous medium for a better comparison with the
previous works reported in the literature. A feed composition of the
AMPS molar fraction fAMPS = 0, 0.5, 0.25,
0.7, and 1 and a monomer concentration ranging from 2.0 M (fAMPS = 1) to 4.2 M (fAMPS = 0) for the copolymers were the parameters to be varied. It is
worth mentioning that the pH value was adjusted to 6.5–8.0
if necessary before adding the RAFT/MADIX agent to the reactive mixture
to avoid the acid form of AMPS. Whatever the composition was, the
polymers reached the theoretical molar masses and were above 1 ×
106 g mol–1 with a dispersity below 1.4.

To go further on the
development of the synthesis of poly(AM-stat-AMPS)
copolymers, we decided to take advantage of the
exothermic process of the AM polymerization and performed the reaction
under an adiabatic chemical process by which polymerization occurs
without the transfer of heat or matter between the reactor system
and its surroundings. This process is called the adiabatic gel process
(AGP). The success of polymerization within these conditions is ensured
by a low rate of reaction at the initial temperature versus a high
rate of reaction when the temperature increases due to the exothermic
reaction to reach the adiabatic reaction temperature. The latter is
the temperature value allowing a complete conversion without a heat
loss. The process takes advantage of the heat of polymerization,18,19 which is 33.5 KJ mol–1 for AMPS and 79.5 ±
0.7 KJ mol–1 for AM allowing the self-heating process
of the medium. The challenge using this process was to keep the control
of polymerization to reach UHMW of PAM, PAMPS, and poly(AM-stat-AMPS) (co)polymers by keeping low dispersities. Under
our work, polymerization has been carried out at a starting temperature
in which the polymerization rate is negligible, that is below 15 °C.
The adiabatic temperature is known to vary with the nature and concentration
of the monomer, and the values have been reported in the Experimental Section. Whatever the polymer composition
is, the adiabatic temperature ranges from 75 to 100 °C. As expected
from the heat of the polymerization of each monomer, the adiabatic
temperature increases with the AM content, and all other parameters
remain the same. All the polymerization processes have been performed
within 20 min; the latter is calculated from the start of the temperature
increase (above 20 °C) until the beginning of the temperature
decrease after having reached the adiabatic value. The oxidant/reducing
agent pair sodium persulfate/sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate dihydrate
was used as the initiator to spontaneously start polymerization at
room temperature. The monomer concentration and molar ratio of the
initiator/RAFT agent were optimized and adapted to the target molar
mass. Under the adiabatic method, the polymerization reaction takes
place in a Dewar flask, and the reactional mixture heats itself until
adiabatic reaction temperature, which is the temperature reached when
the reaction go to completion without a heat loss. After completion,
the temperature decreases and a viscous gel is obtained. The latter
is cut, blended, and dried in an oven at 45 °C for 24 h. This
last step has been optimized under microwave irradiation decreasing
the drying step down to 25 min without altering the polymer as obtained
by 1H NMR analysis
analysis for the chemical composition and by SEC analysis for the
molar masses and distribution (Figure 1).

Figure 1 SEC analyses of entries #1, #2, and #3 obtained via the
AGP process
(see Table 1) with
the refractive index detector (circle open), light scattering detector
(solid circle), and molar masses (box) against time.

The polymerizations of both AM and AMPS has been
studied via the
AGP, and the results have been compared to the above data reported
for the CGP. As the conventional, the adiabatic gel process allows
the syntheses of UHMW PAM, PAMPS, and poly(AM-stat-AMPS) (co)polymers with controlled molar masses and low dispersities.
Targeted molar masses ranging from 0.5 × 106 to 3
× 106 g mol–1 were successfully
reached, and the adiabatic conditions did not affect the results.
Both of the methods, CGP and AGP, have been compared in terms of molar
mass control and dispersity values. As shown in Figure 2, all the data exhibit good agreement between
the theoretical and the experimental molar masses obtained at quantitative
yields (see Table 2 in the Experimental Section). The results
show that RAFT/MADIX polymerization leads to a perfect control of
molar masses either in the conventional or adiabatic gel process up
to 3 × 106 g mol–1. In the same
manner, both methods lead to an extremely low disparity as regards
to the molar mass values, and all the polymers exhibit a value below
1.4, but pure PAM of 3 × 106 g mol–1 molar mass obtained via AGP at the highest rate and temperature
of the series.

symbol) and CGP (close symbol).

Viscosimetric properties of AMPS copolymers have been widely
studied
within the context of enhanced oil recovery applications.20 Other works deal with their polyelectrolyte
properties in the aqueous phase with and without added salt, as a
function of the counter-ions and polymer molar masses.21−27 Within the present work, poly(AM-stat-AMPS) copolymers
with fAMPS = 0.25 and 1 cover a wide range
of molar masses and exhibit narrow dispersities, which make them ideal
candidates to establish the Mark–Houwink–Sakourada (MHS)
Law. The MHS equation is defined as [η] = KMwα where
[η] is the intrinsic viscosity, the constant K is the characteristic of the polymer and solvent, and the MHS exponent
α is a function of the shape of the polymer coil in a solution.
In Figure 3a, intrinsic
viscosities of poly(AM-stat-AMPS) copolymers have
been reported as a function of the added salt concentration. Figure 3b shows intrinsic
viscosities ([η]) against molar masses of the corresponding
polymer series in the aqueous solution with 1.8 M NaNO3 to minimize the polyelectrolyte effects.

Figure 3 (a) Intrinsic viscosities
of poly(AM-stat-AMPS)
with fAMPS = 0.25 (M̅n 6.4 × 105 g mol–1)
(circle open) and : fAMPS = 1 (M̅n 1.240 × 106 g mol–1) (circle solid) vs the salt concentration and Cs–0.5. (b) Intrinsic viscosities against molar masses
of the both polymer series with 1.8 M NaNO3.

The data are strictly linear over the range of
molar masses studied.
The following MHS equations (eqs 2 and 3) are obtained for poly(AM-stat-AMPS) copolymers with fAMPS = 0.25 and 1, respectively. 2   3  

The
copolymer poly(AM-stat-AMPS) with fAMPS = 0.25 shows an exponential α = 0.78
± 0.05, which is the signature of flexible chains in a good solvent.
Homopolymers of AMPS exhibit the greater value of α for a more
extended conformation. Previous works reported by Fisher et al.23,24 reported similar α values in CsCl (α = 0.91 to 1.0),
whereas lower values are obtained in NaCl (0.77 to 1). These results
may be explained by the use of a larger anion with a higher value
of polarizability (nitrate ion) as compared to the chloride one as
already observed in previous works reported in the literature23,24 with the comparison of both cesium and sodium cations.

The
behavior of the intrinsic viscosity versus the added salt concentration
follows a well-known trend.28 The viscosity
of polyelectrolyte solutions is proportional to the square root of
the added salt up to 0.25 and 1.8 M poly(AM-stat-AMPS)
copolymers with fAMPS = 0.25 and 1, respectively,
although the viscosity may be considered as constant for higher salt
concentrations with the disappearance of any polyelectrolyte effect,
and the behavior is thus assimilated to a neutral polymer in the good
solvent.

Conclusions
Within this work UHMW of poly(AM-stat-AMPS) copolymers
have been synthesized via RAFT/MADIX polymerization either in conventional
or purely adiabatic gel processes. Following the latter, we were able
to perform polymerization to a much higher volume and monomer concentration,
from 2.0 to 3.47 M, than that reported so far within the literature
while keeping the control of the molar masses up to 5 × 106 g mol–1, with a narrow dispersity and a
feed composition ranging from fAMPS of
0 to 1. The poly(AM-stat-AMPS) with fAMPS = 0.25 and 1 have been considered as UHMW standards
to study their viscosimetric behavior. The results are described as
a function of the added salt content and molar masses in aqueous solution
and showed the structural differences caused by the copolymer composition
and the added salt concentration range where the polyelectrolyte effect
occurs.

Polymer Synthesis under a Conventional Gel
Process
PAM Homopolymer Synthesis
PAM was synthetized according
to the protocol described by Read et al.17

Typically, polymerization was performed as follows (target M̅n(th) = 106 g mol–1): AM (4.26 g, 60 mmol) and 1 mL of a 4 × 10–3 M aqueous solution of PAM7-XA1 were dissolved in 28.5
mL of MilliQ water in a 100 mL round-bottom flask before cooling down
to 0 °C and degassed with nitrogen for 30 min. A 1.4 × 10–3 M degassed solution (0.5 mL) of APS was then added
to the reactive mixture. The reaction vessel was then heated under
magnetic stirring up to 60 °C under nitrogen for 2 h. The polymer
was isolated by precipitation in acetone and dried under microwave
(MultiwavePro with Rotor 1DRY, Anton Paar). Yield 95% obtained by
NMR analysis.

PAMPS Homopolymer Synthesis
Typically,
polymerization
was performed as follows (target M̅n(th) = 106 g mol–1): AMPS 50 wt % (11.00
g, 24 mmol) and 1 mL of a 4.8 × 10–3 M aqueous
solution of PAM7-X were dissolved in a 20 mL vial before
cooling at 0 °C and degassed with nitrogen during 30 min. Two
aqueous solutions of 3.3 × 10–3 M APS and NaFS
were degassed, and 0.25 mL of each was then added to the reaction
flask. The reactive medium was heated up to 60 °C under magnetic
stirring and nitrogen for 2 h.

All polymers were isolated by
precipitation in acetone and dried under microwave irradiation (MultiwavePro
with Rotor 1DRY, Anton Paar). The sample was successfully heated under
200 W and air cooling for 10, 10, and 5 min and cooled down under
air cooling, and no irradiation for 5 min between each step. The polymer
was isolated by precipitation in acetone and dried under microwave

Poly(AM-stat-AMPS) Statistical
Copolymer Synthesis
Polymerization was performed as follows
(target M̅n(th) = 106 g mol–1 and a
25:75 AMPS/AM theoretical composition): AM (16.12 g, 0.23 mol), 50
wt % AMPS (34.67 g, 0.087 mol), 1 g of a 3.3 × 10–2 M solution of PAM7-X, and 62 g of a 0.1 g mol–1 NaCl aqueous solution were added in a 250 mL round-bottom flask
before cooling down to 0 °C and degassed by nitrogen during 30
min. Two solutions of 5.7 × 10–3 M APS and
NaFS were degassed, and 1 g of each was simultaneously added to the
reaction flask. The reactive medium was heated up to 60 °C under
mechanical stirring and nitrogen for 16 h. The polymer was isolated
by precipitation in acetone and dried under microwave (MultiwavePro
with Rotor 1DRY, Anton Paar). Yield 90% obtained by NMR analysis.

All the copolymers were performed following the same experimental
procedure by keeping equimolar concentrations of APS and NAFS. The
initiator to the RAFT transfer agent ratio was experimentally optimized
for each composition. Experimental conditions are summarized in Table 2.

Polymer Synthesis
under an Adiabatic Gel Process
Polymerization
processes were performed using a protocol adapted from Read at al.17 to be processed in adiabatic conditions.29 Monomer concentrations were increased in comparison
to the conventional method, whereas the monomer-to-agent RAFT ratio
was maintained the same. Homopolymers and copolymers were synthetized
following the same protocol. The synthesis of a copolymer was reported
below as an example.

Poly(AM-stat-PAMPS) Statistical
Copolymer Synthesis
Polymerization was performed as follows
(for a 25:75 AMPS/AM theoretical
composition): AM (185 g, 2.6 mol), 50 wt % aqueous AMPS (399.8 g,
0.87 mol), and 415 g of deionized water were introduced in a 2 L beaker,
and the mixture was cooled down to 5 °C. Then, a 50 wt % aqueous
solution of NaOH was added to reach a pH value of 6.5–8.0,
whereas the temperature was maintained below 15 °C. PAM7-X was added to the mixture according to Table 2. The reaction mixture was cooled down to
0 °C before transferring in a 1 L Dewar flask and degassed by
nitrogen. Initiator solutions were added to the mixture according
to the quantity as reported in Table 3, whereas degassing was maintained until the reaction
temperature starts to rise. The temperature reaches 90 °C before
decreasing down to room temperature. The polymer gel was then cut
and granulated using a granulator with grids to obtain gel particles
with a diameter below 6 mm. These gel particles were dried in an oven
at 45 °C overnight. The dry powder obtained is grinded and sieved
to obtain a white powder with a particle diameter below 1 mm with
less than 15% water content as measured by thermogravimetric analysis.
The yields are reported in Table 3.

Instrumentation and Characterization
The number-average
molar mass (M̅n) and dispersity
(Đ) were determined by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) using an Agilent 1260 Iso pump G1310B (Agilent technologies)
equipped either with four Shodex OHpak columns (SB-807HQ, SB-805HQ,
SB-803HQ, and SB-802HQ) or two columns (SB-807HQ and SB-805HQ) for
molar masses above 5 × 105 g mol–1 and two online detectors: a differential refractometer Waters 2410
(Waters Corporation) and a DAWN HELEOSII (Wyatt Technology Corporation)
utilizing a 120 mW solid-state laser operating at 658 nm and fitted
with a K5 cell. A 0.1 M NaNO3 aqueous solution phosphate-buffered
at pH = 8 was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1. Interdetector volumes, normalization, and calibration constant
of the refractometer were determined by using bovine serum albumin
(dn/dc = 0.165 ± 0.001) and
a polyoxyethylene standard (Mw = 20 000
g mol–1, (dn/dc) = 0.135 ± 0.001). Polymer samples were prepared by diluting
the reaction mixture in the SEC eluent to reach an approximate concentration
of 0.2 to 1 g L–1. After 24 h of orbital stirring,
they were filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (mixture of cellulose
esters–Millipore). Fifty microliters of these solutions was
injected. The number-average molar mass and polydispersity were obtained
from the data collected and analyzed using the ASTRA SEC software
(version 6.1, Wyatt Technology Corporation). The calculation of the
molar mass was carried out according to the Zimm fit method. The refractive
index increments, (dn/dc), for this
system were determined according to our previous work30 to be 0.185 ± 0.001 and 0.144 ± 0.001 mL g–1 for PAM and AM, respectively, and 0.133 ± 0.001
and 0.113 ± 0.001 mL g–1 for polyAMPS and AMPS,
respectively. For the molar masses above 106 g mol–1, the results have been characterized and confirmed
by the SEC analysis with the characterization method developed elsewhere.31

Experimental compositions of copolymers
were obtained by 1H NMR analysis in D2O of the
purified product using a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz. Spectra were analyzed
with the Topspin software (version 3.5, Bruker). Polymer conversion
has been obtained according to a previous methodology.32

The measurement of viscosity η for
dilute solutions of polymers
was carried out on a capillary rheometer based on the Poiseuille law
according to the protocol reported elsewhere.33
