2-Hydroxy-N′-((thiophene-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide
(HTMBH) was synthesized by conventional method as well as by ultrasonication
(US). The ultrasound-assisted synthesis of HTMBH was found to have
good yield and be more eco-friendly compared to the conventional method
of synthesis. The synthesized compound HTMBH was characterized by
Fourier transform infrared, 1H NMR, and CHN analyses. The
corrosion inhibition behavior of HTMBH was investigated using gravimetric
and electrochemical methods in 0.5 M H2SO4.
The thermodynamic adsorption parameters revealed that HTMBH was adsorbed
on the mild steel surface in both ways, physically and chemically,
although physisorption is predominant. The study of activation parameters
revealed that it is the increase in activation energy that is a prominent
factor to lower the corrosion rate in acid medium. Atomic force microscopy
analysis is also carried out to investigate the effect of HTMBH on
the surface of mild steel surface in acid solution. The contact angle
measurement showed decreased affinity of mild steel surface for acid
solution containing HTMBH. The results obtained from all of these
methods showed good consistency.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
conventional (Con.) methods, which are generally used for a
chemical reaction to take place, have some limitations such as energy
inefficiency, time consumption, and less yield of product. These shortcomings
of the conventional method of synthesis led chemists to look for alternative
methods of synthesis, such as exposure to microwave irradiation and
ultrasound waves. Sound waves having minimum frequencies to which
human ears can respond are considered as ultrasound.1 The ultrasound wave-assisted method of chemical synthesis
is found superior to conventional method as it saves energy and time
and results in high yield of desired products. In 1927, Loomis2 studied and reported the effect of ultrasound
waves on chemical reaction. Initially, ultrasound waves were not frequently
used, but with progressive development in the field of chemistry,
its use has been increased by many folds and lead to a subdiscipline
known as sonochemistry.

Ultrasonication (US) has become an important
tool in the field
of organic synthesis,3−8 which leads to maximum conversion of reactants into products. Liete
et al.9 reported the ultrasound-mediated
synthesis of a variety of aryl hydrazones and found that ultrasound
waves considerably reduced the reaction time with improved yield.
Thus, ultrasound-mediated synthesis can be considered as a powerful
tool for energy conservation and waste minimization.10−14

The importance of Schiff bases has been increased by many
folds
in recent years.15 The importance and application
of Schiff bases has ever attracted enormous research interest and
created huge scope for future research. Schiff bases have shown a
number of industrial applications as well as biological activities,
such as antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, anticancer,16 and antimalarial.17−19 Schiff bases having
thiophene nucleus have been very important for study because these
compounds can be used as a structural unit to synthesize charge-transporting
molecules, which can be used in transistors, light-emitting diodes,
and organic solar cells.20−23 Thiophene nucleus has very promising characteristic24 and therefore can be considered as a significant
topic of study in the field of heterocyclic chemistry. The lone pairs
of electrons present on an S atom are more effectively delocalized
in the heterocyclic ring compared to other heteroatoms such as O and
N in case of furan and pyrrole because of the larger size of S atom.
A variety of Schiff bases with thiophene moiety have been synthesized,
which are very versatile especially for producing a variety of biologically
active complexes.25−28

The chemical properties of hydrazones have been intensively
studied
in several research fields because of their high physiological activity
and chelating capability.29 Acid hydrazide
and hydrazones have shown a number of applications in biological as
well as analytical chemistry.30−36 A variety of Schiff bases have been studied as corrosion inhibitors
recently.37−40 The inhibition property of Schiff bases is due to the presence of
C=N bond.41,42

Corrosion has always been
a major problem of metallic structure
because economic cost due to corrosion failure is so high; furthermore,
it leads to public risk, so it is time to develop some novel substances
that can retard corrosion of metallic structure especially in acidic
medium. Organic compounds especially those having heteroatom, such
as N, O, S, and P, have been frequently used as corrosion inhibitor
to mitigate corrosion because of their effectiveness, ease of use,
and economic aspect. Further, the presence of heteroatoms acts as
an active center to be adsorbed on the metallic surface and mitigate
the metallic corrosion.43,44

Thus, in view
of the importance of hydrazide and hydrazones, we
have synthesized benzohydrazide with thiophene moiety and investigated
its anticorrosion behavior against corrosion of mild steel in 0.5
M H2SO4. We have chosen this molecule to examine
its anticorrosion performance because of the presence of aromatic
ring, nitrogen atoms, and thiophene nucleus, which makes adsorption
easier on the surface of mild steel. In addition to these features,
the presence of a vacant 3d orbital of S atom of thiophene creates
the possibility of formation of dπ–dπ bond with 3d electrons of Fe. In view of importance of green chemistry
and cleaner environment, we have synthesized 2-hydroxy-N′-((thiophene-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide (HTMBH) by an
ultrasound-assisted method using ethanol as a solvent and evaluated
its corrosion inhibition effect against mild steel corrosion in acid
medium.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The studied inhibitor 2-hydroxy-N′-((thiophen-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide
(HTMBH)
was synthesized according to the reaction scheme presented in Figure 1. The starting material
thiophene-2-carboaxaldehyde (A) was allowed to react with 2-hydroxybenzoylhydrazide
(B) by the following two methods. In the first method, thiophene-2-carboaxaldehyde
(A) was refluxed with 2-hydroxybenzohydrazide (B) in a round-bottom
flask using glacial acetic acid as a catalyst for 3 h, resulting in
the production of HTMBH, whereas the same product HTMBH can also be
produced by the second method, which involved ultrasound irradiation
of A with B in ethanol for 4 min. The second method considerably reduced
the reaction time (from 3 h to 4 min) as well as greatly enhanced
the yield of product. The use of ultrasound waves appreciably increases
the yield of the product (from 78% in conventional method to 95% in
ultrasound-assisted method) and decreases the reaction time (from
3 h to 4 min). So, it provides a faster and cleaner methodology for
the synthesis of the studied compound HTMBH compared to the conventional
method.

Figure 1 Route of synthesis of compound HTMBH by (A) conventional method
and (B) ultrasound-assisted method.

The Fourier transform infrared spectra of the compound HTMBH
shows
absorption bands at 3450, 3250, 1654, 1630, and 998 cm–1 (as presented in Table 1), which are assigned to ν(OH), ν(NH), ν(C=O),
ν(C=N), and ν(N–N), respectively. The absence
of NH2 peak, which was originally present in ortho-hydroxybenzohydrazide, indicates that it is condensed with the carbonyl
group of thiophene nucleus. The presence of a peak at 1630 cm–1 is assigned to C=N, which clearly indicates
the formation of Schiff base HTMBH.

The 1H NMR spectrum of HTMBH shows resonance signals
between 7.86 and 7.68 ppm, which are assigned to phenyl ring protons.
A low-field signal at 10.90 ppm reveals the presence of secondary
amino proton (−NH), which confirms the presence of keto form
of HTMBH; if enolization would have taken place, then −NH proton
would have been disappeared. A signal appears at 12.30 ppm, which
confirmed the presence of −OH proton. The signal appearing
between 6.92 and 6.97 ppm confirms the presence of thiophene ring
protons.

2.2 Electrochemical Study
2.2.1 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
The open corrosion potential
(OCRP) is considered as
a parameter that decides the tendency of a material to be oxidized
in any corrosive medium.45,46 This potential is a
function of time as the surface of material changed with time. The
working electrode was immersed in acid solution in the absence and
presence of different concentrations of HTMBH before running each
and every electrochemical experiment and its open-circuit
potential (OCP) was recorded after 180 min. After this elapsed time
interval, a stable and constant open corrosion potential related to
corrosion potential (Ecorr) was attained.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been used as a significant
tool in corrosion and solid-state laboratories.47 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to
throw some light into the correlation between electrochemical measurements
and corrosion rates. The EIS experiments were carried out for mild
steel samples immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 having
different concentrations of HTMBH. The EIS images for MS with varying
concentration of HTMBH are presented in Figure 2a–c. An equivalent circuit, which
is used to analyze the impedance data, is presented in Figure 2d. Different impedance parameters
calculated by fitting the data to a given equivalent circuit and corrosion
inhibition efficiency using EIS data are presented in Table 2. The impedance data can be
used to calculate the corrosion inhibition efficiency of inhibitor
as 1  where Rpi and Rp0 are polarization
resistances in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively.
The sum of adsorption resistance (Rads) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) gives the value of polarization resistance, Rp. The increasing value of Rp with
increasing concentration of HTMBH indicates that it is the charge-transfer
process that controls the corrosion of mild steel.

4.06	1.12	694.9	0.907	13.0	8.0	–0.58	–10.60	684.30	98.11	
As seen in Figure 2, the Nyquist plot
consists of a high-frequency capacitive loop and
a low-frequency inductive loop. Increasing concentration of HTMBH
resulted in increased diameter of capacitive loop, which is an indication
of increased effectiveness of HTMBH against corrosion of mild steel.
The low-frequency inductive loop is obtained due to either adsorption
of M2+ (Fe2+) or relaxation of already adsorbed
species, such as SO42– and Hads+.48

The increment of impedance or decrease
in Cdl (double-layer capacitance) with
increasing HTMBH concentration,
as observed in Table 2, is due to adsorption of the same on MS surface, resulting in increased
thickness of the double layer. The relation between double-layer capacitance, Cdl, and thickness of the protective layer is
given by eq 2.49 2  where δorg is the
thickness
of the protective layer, ε0 is the dielectric constant,
and εr is the relative dielectric constant.

Theoretically, an ideal Nyquist plot should be a semicircle having
its center on x axis. Observation of the Nyquist
plots obtained revealed that they are depressed semicircle with its
center below x axis. This is due to either heterogeneity
of electrode surface or distribution of resistivity or other physical
property of the system. Thus, constant phase element (CPE) is used
to replace ideal capacitance in equivalent circuit.50

A CPE’s impedance can be calculated using eq 3 3  

where Q0 is equal to reciprocal of
impedance (1/|Z|) for ω = 1 rad s–1.

The decreasing value of Y with increasing
inhibitor
concentration (presented in Table 2) indicates more adsorption of inhibitor HTMBH molecule
on the surface of mild steel.

The value of n decides the behavior of CPE;51 for n = 0, 1, −1, and
0.5, the CPE represents resistance, capacitance, inductance, and Warburg
impedance, respectively. The value of n ranged from
0.825 to 0.907, which confirmed the capacitive behavior of this system.
Examination of Table 2 reveals that the value of n is increased by increasing
the concentration of HTMBH, which is an indication of increasing capacitive
behavior of this system. The Cdl values
can be calculated using CPE parameters as 4  The phase angle decreased by the addition
of inhibitor HTMBH (Figure 2c), which is attributed to increase in capacitive behavior
at the metal solution interface due to decreased MS dissolution rate.

2.2.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization
The
potentiodynamic polarization curves for mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 with different concentrations of HTMBH are
presented in Figure 3. The polarization parameters, i.e., corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (icorr), and cathodic and anodic Tafel slopes (βc and βa, respectively), are given in Table 3. The inhibition efficiency
using corrosion current density can be calculated using eq 5 5  In the
presence of inhibitor HTMBH, the corrosion
current, cathodic or anodic, decreases (given in Table 3), resulting in reduced corrosion
rate. Also, examination of Tafel slope indicated that anodic slope
is relatively constant except at 1.62 × 10–4 M HTMBH concentration. The relatively constant values of anodic
Tafel slope indicate that it simply blocked the reaction sites of
MS surface and thereby lowered the corrosion rate. The increased value
of cathodic Tafel slope, βc, with inhibitor HTMBH
compared to that in 0.5 M H2SO4 indicates that
the mechanism of cathodic reaction is affected, i.e., higher energy
will be required for evolution of H2 gas. The relatively
higher value of anodic Tafel slope at 1.62 × 10–4 M HTMBH concentration might be due to change of chemical to electrochemical
mechanism. The values of corrosion potential (Ecorr) are not changed significantly; the change in Ecorr ranged from 3 to 47 mV, which is less than
85 mV,52,53 confirming the mixed-type nature of the
studied inhibitor HTMBH. The results obtained from gravimetric analysis,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization
showed good consistency.

0.5 M H2SO4 acid solution in the absence and
presence of different
concentrations of HTMBH.

2.3 Gravimetric
Analysis
To evaluate
relationship between anticorrosion performance of HTMBH and its concentration,
gravimetric analyses have been performed with different amounts of
HTMBH in 0.5 M H2SO4. It was found that the
studied compound has increasing efficiency with increasing concentration
(Figure 4a). The result
of weight loss study presented in Figure 4b clearly indicates that the rate of corrosion
mitigated considerably with an increasing amount of studied compound
HTMBH. This result supports the view that at higher concentration
the HTMBH molecule adsorbed more effectively on the MS surface and
results in reduced corrosion rate, which takes place initially due
to adsorption of the anion of the acid used, i.e., SO42–. Different experimental results showed good consistency
(Figure 5).

2.3.1 Adsorption Isotherm
Corrosion inhibition
is mainly due to adsorption and therefore it is usually studied through
adsorption isotherm,54 i.e., relation between
amounts of adsorbate adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent. Depending
on the forces acting between adsorbate and adsorbent, adsorption is
of two types: physical adsorption or physisorption and chemical adsorption
or chemisorption. Physisorption involves simple van der Waals forces
or electrostatic interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent, whereas
chemisorption involves chemical forces between them.55 In this study, several adsorption isotherms were tested
to fit the experimental data, but Langmuir adsorption isotherm provides
the best linear fit as its linear correlation coefficient is close
to unity.

The general form of the Langmuir equation is shown
below 6  where θ is the number of sites
on the
mild steel (adsorbent) on which inhibitor molecules are adsorbed, Cinh is the inhibitor concentration present in
bulk of the solution, and Kads is the
equilibrium constant for distribution of inhibitor HTMBH molecule
between mild steel surface and bulk of the acid solution. The Langmuir
adsorption isotherm plot for adsorption of HTMBH is shown in Figure 6a. The intercept
of Langmuir isotherm gives the value of Kads (presented in Table 4), which is related to Gibb’s free energy of adsorption by eq 7(56) 7  where 55.5
is the amount of water in bulk
of solution.

of HTMBH
on the surface of mild steel and (b) adsorption isotherm plot for
ln Kads vs 1/T.

Parameters
for Adsorption of HTMBH on Mild Steel in 0.5 M H2SO4
conc. of HTMBH (M × 10–4)	temperature (K)	Kads (104 × M–1)	–ΔG°ads (kJ mol–1)	ΔH°ads (kJ mol–1)

 	313	4.82	39.12	 	
 	323	2.95	39.01	 	
333	1.80	38.85	 	 	
This
value of free energy (ΔG°ads) gives the idea about interaction between adsorbate and
adsorbent, i.e., HTMBH and the mild steel surface. In general, −20
kJ mol–1 or less indicates physical interaction
between adsorbate and adsorbent, whereas −40 kJ mol–1 or more indicates chemical interaction between them. The value of
ΔG°ads (given in Table 4) in our study indicates that
HTMBH interacted with mild steel surface in both ways, i.e., physisorption
and chemisorption are involved during interaction of HTMBH to MS surface.
The high value of Kads and ΔG°ads indicated strong interaction of HTMBH
molecule with MS surface and hence its high inhibition efficiency
is justified.

It is well known that corrosion inhibition of
metal and alloy using
inhibitors is due to adsorption of inhibitors on the metal surface.
Actually, it is solvent, i.e., water molecule, which could also be
adsorbed on metal surface; thus, adsorption of inhibitor can be considered
as a competitive phenomenon, which depends on the composition of molecule,
electrochemical potential, and physical environment, i.e., temperature
of the solution.

The adsorption of molecule to the metal surface
can be regarded
as 8  where x is the number
of
water molecules displaced by one molecule of inhibitor present in
the bulk of the solution to be adsorbed.

The anticorrosion performance
of HTMBH can be better explained
by considering thermodynamic parameters. The equilibrium constant
for adsorption–desorption process, Kads, is related to enthalpy of adsorption according to eq 9 9  The plot
of ln Kads versus 1/T is presented in Figure 6b with a slope value equal
to −ΔH°ads/R. The value of ΔH°ads is given
in Table 4. The low
value of ΔH°ads confirms that
HTMBH is adsorbed on the mild steel surface largely by physisorption.

To calculate activation parameters of corrosion, gravimetric analyses
were performed at different temperatures, i.e., 303–333 K.
The activation parameters can be calculated from corrosion rate as57 10   11  where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, CR is the corrosion rate, and λ is the pre-exponential factor.
The plots of log CR versus 1/T and log CR/T versus 1/T for mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 having different concentrations of HTMBH are
presented in Figure 7. The values of activation parameters calculated from these two plots
are presented in Table 5. The increased value of activation energy in the presence of inhibitor
HTMBH compared to bare acid solution indicates that energy barrier
for occurrence of corrosion is increased.

Figure 7 Arrhenius plots (a) log CR vs
1/T and (b) log CR/T vs 1/T for carbon steel in 0.5
M H2SO4 in the absence and presence of different
concentrations of HTMBH.

4.06	67.06	9.78 × 104	64.33	–34.03	
The increase in the
value of ΔH*, presented
in Table 5, in the
presence of HTMBH, confirmed its high protection efficiency. The negative
value of ΔS* as given in Table 5 proves that randomness of activated complex
is reduced compared to that of reactant; further increased values
of ΔS* at higher concentration of the studied
inhibitor HTMBH indicates that the presence of higher concentration
of HTMBH led to competitive adsorption equilibrium between inhibitor
molecule present in bulk of the solution and water molecules already
adsorbed on the surface of mild steel. The entropy of activation is
actually the algebraic sum of entropy of inhibitor and solvent; thus,
increase in entropy is only due to increased entropy of solvent molecule.

2.4 Morphological Study
2.4.1 Atomic
Force Microscopy (AFM)
In
recent years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used frequently
to investigate the surface morphology. The AFM images of MS surface
are presented in Figure 8. The average surface roughness of MS sample before immersion in
acid solution was 58 nm (Figure 8a). The average surface roughness of mild steel coupon
immersed in acid solution with HTMBH (Figure 8b) is 338 nm, which can be considered as
smooth surface compared to the one immersed in acid solution with
average surface roughness of 570 nm (Figure 8c).

Figure 8 Atomic force micrography images of (a) mild
steel before immersion
in 0.5 M H2SO4, (b) after immersion in inhibited
solution, and (c) after immersion in bare acid solution.

2.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
Scanning electron micrographs were scanned to study
the effect of
HTMBH on the surface morphology of mild steel. The scanning electron
micrography image of mild steel surface immersed in bare acid solution
is shown in Figure 9a, whereas that of mild steel surface immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 with 4.06 × 10–4 M HTMBH is
shown in Figure 9b.
Examination of Figure 9 revealed that the surface of mild steel coupon immersed in acid
solution with inhibitor HTMBH is comparatively less damaged (Figure 9b) compared to the
one immersed in bare acid solution (Figure 9a), which confirms the inhibitive action
of HTMBH.

Figure 9 SEM images of mild steel sample after immersion in (a) 0.5 H2SO4 and (b) 0.5 M H2SO4 +
4.06 × 10–4 M HTMBH.

2.5 Contact Angle Measurement
The results
of contact angle measurement are presented in Figure 10. The least contact angle for bare acid
solution confirms the maximum affinity of mild steel surface to the
bare acid solution having no inhibitor. The contact angle decreased
gradually by addition of inhibitor HTMBH, which means that mild steel
surface showed lower affinity to the acid solutions having inhibitor
HTMBH.

concentrations of HTMBH at the mild steel surface.

3 Corrosion Inhibition Mechanism
The mechanism of corrosion inhibition of mild steel by 2-hydroxy-N′-((thiophene-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide (HTMBH)
in acid solution was established by corrosion reaction kinetics obtained
from electrochemical measurements.

In general, corrosion inhibitor
mitigates corrosion in one of the
following ways:(i) Inhibitor reduces the corrosion rate
by adsorption on the metal surface.58

(ii) It may lead to the formation
of oxide
film of the base metal.59

(iii) It may also react with corrosive
component present in corrosive medium and result into a complex.60



The organic corrosion
inhibitors adsorbed on the metal surface
thereby mitigate the corrosion rate. It is well accepted that adsorption
of corrosion inhibitor is a competitive phenomenon replacing water
molecules already adsorbed on the metal surface and subsequently adsorbed
itself according to eq 8.

The adsorption of inhibitor molecule on the mild steel surface
may take place in a number of methods as follows:(i) May adsorb electrostatically on the
metal surface.

(ii) May
adsorb by donation of unshared
electron pair located on heteroatoms or π-electrons of aromatic
system to vacant 3d orbital of iron.

(iii) Retro donation may also be attributed
for adsorption of inhibitor molecule on the surface of mild steel.



Examination of the structure of HTMBH reveals
that the presence
of C=N facilitates physical interaction, whereas unshared electron
pairs located on heteroatom and π-electrons led to chemical
interaction with the mild steel surface. Similar findings were reported
earlier by other researchers.61,62 The HTMBH was found
superior compared to some earlier studied hydrazones of furfuraldehyde63 and benzaldehyde.64 The possibility of the dπ–dπ bonding between 3d electrons of Fe atom and vacant 3d orbitals of
S atom of thiophene nucleus is attributed for the appreciable efficiency
of HTMBH at higher concentrations even at higher temperature. Such
type of inhibitors which not only offer d-electrons but also have
vacant d-orbitals to accept metal electrons forming stable chelates,
which have already been studied as excellent inhibitors.65

4 Conclusions
1. Ultrasound-assisted
synthesis of HTMBH
was found more productive compared to conventional method.

2. Although the cathodic reaction
of corrosion
is more prominently affected, the shift of corrosion potential confirmed
the mixed-type nature of HTMBH inhibitor.

3. Langmuir adsorption isotherm is followed
by adsorption of HTMBH on the mild steel surface in sulfuric acid
medium.

4. The increase
in activation energy in
the presence of inhibitor HTMBH lowers the corrosion rate.

5. The low value of enthalpy
of adsorption
(≈26 KJ mol–1) indicates that HTMBH is adsorbed
on the mild steel surface largely by physical method.

6. The results of electrochemical and
surface study were well supported by the data of contact angle measurements.

5 Experimental Procedure
5.1 Synthesis of 2-Hydroxy-N′-((thiophene-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide
(HTMBH)
In the present study, thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde
is allowed to react with ortho-hydroxybenzohydrazide
conventionally66 as well as by ultrasound-assisted
method in ethanol to get 2-hydroxy-N′-((thiophene-2-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide
(HTMBH) in reasonably good yield. All of the spectral data (IR, 1H NMR, and CHN analyses) of the synthesized compound were
according to its assigned structure. The physical data and yield of
the synthesized compound (of both methods: conventional and ultrasound-assisted)
are given in Table 1.

In conventional method, thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde is refluxed
with ortho-hydroxybenzohydrazide in ethanolic solution
in the presence of glacial acetic acid as a catalyst in a round-bottom
flask. The reaction mixture was cooled after refluxing, and a yellow
product was obtained.

The uncorrected melting point of the synthesized
compound HTMBH
was measured in an open capillary. The spectral data of HTMBH were
recorded as earlier67 using a JASCO FT/IR-5300
spectrophotometer for IR and a Jeol AL 300 FTNMR for 1H
NMR spectra. The elemental analysis data were obtained using Exeter
Analytical Inc. model CE-440 CHN analyzer. All of the required chemicals
to synthesize HTMBH were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich.

5.2 Corrosion Inhibition Study
5.2.1 Electrochemical
Study
The electrochemical
study was performed using a three-electrode cell consisting of saturated
calomel electrode as the reference one, mild steel as the working
electrode, and a Pt foil of 1 cm2 size as the counter electrode.
All of the electrochemical studies were performed under nonstirring
condition after immersing the mild steel (working) electrode in 0.5
M H2SO4 for 180 min so that it could attain
stable corrosion potential. Gamry potentiostat/galvanostat (model
300) with DC 105 and Echem Analyst software was used to perform all
of the electrochemical experiments.

Stock solution of HTMBH
was made in 0.5 M H2SO4. This solution was used
for all electrochemical and gravimetric experiments.

To record
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements,
the frequency was kept in the range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an
alternating current voltage amplitude of 0.01 V at Ecorr under potentiostatic condition. All of the EIS data
were tested for fitting of appropriate equivalent circuit using software
Echem Analyst. The potentiodynamic polarization curves were scanned
as described elsewhere.68

5.2.2 Gravimetric analysis
The aggressive
solution of acid (0.5 M) was made from 98% H2SO4 supplied from E. Merck. The weight loss experiments were carried
out with different concentrations of HTMBH ranged from 0.81 ×
10–4 to 4.06 × 10–4 M according
to ASTM G-3169 using stock solution of
HTMBH. The mild steel sheet of composition (by weight): C, 0.17; Mn,
0.46; Si, 0.26; S, 0.017; P, 0.019; remaining Fe was used for all
of the experiments. The mild steel sheet of above composition was
cut into coupons of 2.5 × 2.0 × 0.025 cm3 size
and used further for gravimetric analysis. These mild steel coupons
were abraded first by emery paper of grade 200–1200 and then
used for gravimetric analysis.

The inhibition efficiency of
the studied compound HTMBH based on gravimetric method can be calculated
using the equation70 12  where w0 and wi are the weight loss values in the absence
and presence of HTMBH, respectively.

5.3 Morphological
Study
5.3.1 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
To
investigate the effect of HTMBH on the surface morphology of mild
steel, atomic force micrographs of different mild steel coupons immersed
in 0.5 M H2SO4 in the absence and presence of
the studied inhibitor were scanned. These micrographs were recorded
by an NT-MDT multimode atomic force microscope, with frequency in
the range of 2.4–2.5 × 105 Hz and spring constant
of 11.5 N m–1. All of the images were interpreted
by NOVA software.71 The standard tips were
used in semicontact mode to scan topographical images. Prior to recording
topographical images, mild steel samples were immersed in bare 0.5
M H2SO4 acid solution and acid solution having
4.06 × 10–4 M HTMBH for 3 h; then, they are
taken out, washed, and dried. These dried mild steel samples were
used to record topographical images.

5.3.2 Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The scanning electron micrographs
were also scanned to study the
effect of HTMBH on the surface morphology of mild steel in acidic
medium. The mild steel specimens were prepared as for AFM and scanned
with a TM 3000 scanning electron microscope with an acceleration voltage
of 5000 V and a working distance of 8.5 mm.

5.3.3 Contact
Angle Measurement
To evaluate
the affinity of mild steel surface for acid solutions with varying
concentration of inhibitor, contact angles were measured by a Rame–Hart
goniometer (Netcong) by a static sessile drop technique, which is
normally used for characterization of solid as well as liquid surface
energies. The mild steel samples were cleaned properly with acetone
to assure the mild steel surface free of dust, grease, and organic
traces, which can influence the contact angle measurement. The cleaned
mild steel samples were then used to measure contact angle.
