In
recent years, the development of ultrasound contrast agents
has encouraged their use as a drug system for diagnosis and therapy.
In this paper, polylactic acid (PLA) composite microbubbles (FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA)
were prepared with graphene oxide (GO) as a carrier of the targeted
factor folic acid (FA) and doxorubicin (DOX) by the multiple emulsification–solvent
evaporating process. Appearance, particle size, and zeta potential
of PLA composite microbubbles were characterized by using a nanoparticle
size analyzer and transmission electron microscopy. Breast cancer
cells MCF-7 were used to evaluate the antitumor activity of PLA composite
microbubbles in vitro by using the CCK-8 and acridine orange staining
method. The ultrasonic imaging effect of PLA composite microbubbles
was investigated in New Zealand white rabbits by the Doppler color
ultrasound imaging system. With Kunming mice as the research model,
the acute toxicity of PLA composite microbubbles was examined. The
experimental results showed that the prepared PLA composite microbubbles
presented a hollow and spherical shape with a particle size of 600
nm or so and a zeta potential of −37.5 ± 10.0 mV. They
had a good effect of the enhancing imaging, and clear ultrasound imaging
can be obtained. PLA composite microbubbles showed a significant proliferation
inhibition effect on breast cancer cells MCF-7 in a dose-dependent
manner. After PLA composite microbubbles were modified by FA, they
were good for targeting FA receptors on the surface of MCF-7 cells,
which increased the inhibition rate of the tumor cells. LD50 of PLA composite microbubbles was 87.529 mg·kg–1; the mice did not show the acute toxicity when the dose of composite
microbubbles was lower than this value.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays, malignant tumors
are second only to cardiovascular disease
in human health, among which breast cancer is a common cancer worldwide
and it seriously affects the female body and life.1,2 Early
diagnosis and treatment is an important measure to improve the survival
rate of cancer patients. Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) can enhance
the contrast of ultrasound images in vivo by intravenous injection
when ultrasound diagnosis is performed, thereby providing more basis
for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.3 The continuous development of new UCAs has encouraged their use
in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral perfusion,4−6 breast tumor,7 stomach cancer,8 carotid artery, and ovarian cancer.9−11

Graphene oxide (GO) is a two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial
with
a large specific surface area, which has become a focus of attention
as a drug carrier. GO can carry aromatic ring drugs through noncovalent
interactions to achieve drug delivery in the body. Studies have generally
found that GO possesses a large number of active groups such as carboxyl,
carbonyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups. The existence of these groups
is not only conducive to its biochemical structural modification but
also makes it have good biocompatibility.12

With doxorubicin (DOX) as the model drug and GO modified with
folic
acid (FA) as the new biological material, the delivery system of polylactic
acid (PLA) composite microbubbles was constructed and has been described
in this paper. For this new composite microbubble UCA, the ultrasound
imaging effect in vivo and in vitro, the inhibition of the breast
cancer cells MCF-7 in vitro, and acute toxicity in Kunming (KM) mice
were studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure of the Targeting Drug-Loaded PLA
Composite Microbubbles
As shown in Figure 1a, the microbubble film was constructed by
using the GO-combined PLA; the drug was loaded not only on the GO
but also within the microbubble with DOX as the model drug. Meanwhile,
FA was used as the targeted factor and modified on the surface of
the composite microbubble. It can be seen from transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), as shown in Figure 1b, that the PLA composite microbubble showed a hollow
structure, resulting from encasing N2 inside the microbubble.
GO was linked on the surface of the composite microbubble; hence,
the microbubble membrane layer appeared dark. Specifically, the introduced
DOX during the preparation of the primary suspension sustained in
the PLA film and the bonding product of GO and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
was used as the film-forming agent and covered the outer space of
the composite microbubble. DOX was loaded on GO by π–π
conjugate action, and FA was coupled on the surface of GO through
amidation reaction. In addition, the loading rates of DOX and GO in
the obtained FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles were respectively 7.42
and 19.56% in the previous study.14

microbubbles. (a) Structure simulation and (b)
TEM.

Figure 2 shows the
particle distribution and zeta potential of composite microbubbles.
From Figure 2a, the
particle size distribution of composite microbubbles showed a single
peak at about 600 nm and conformed to the injection standard. Figure 2b shows that the
zeta potential of composite microbubbles is about (−37.5 ±
10) mV, which made them difficult to precipitate or agglomerate, and
the obtained composite microbubbles had good stability.

2.2 Antitumor
Activity in Vitro
2.2.1 Inhibition Rate of MCF-7
Cells
As shown in Figure 3, after the free DOX group, DOX/GO/PLA microbubbles,
DOX/PLA microbubbles,
DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles, and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles interacted
with breast cancer cells MCF-7 in the same order for 48 h; the inhibition
effect of every group of microbubbles on breast cancer cells MCF-7
obviously increased with the increase of drug concentration, which
obviously showed a dose-dependent phenomenon. There was no obvious
difference between the DOX/GO/PLA microbubble group and free DOX group;
the existence form of DOX loading on GO in DOX/GO/PLA microbubbles
was similar to that of the free DOX group because of the π–π
conjugate effect between the DOX and GO. However, the cell inhibition
rate of the PLA/DOX microbubble group had significant difference in
comparison with the free DOX group, and the obtained data were statistically
significant (*P < 0.05), which indicated that
the effect of microbubbles enveloping the DOX on the drug loading
was favorable. Similarly, compared with the free DOX group, the cell
inhibition rates of the DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble group and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubble group also had significant differences, and *P < 0.01. Furthermore, the difference of cell inhibition rates
between the DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble group and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubble group was obvious and there was statistical significance
(*P < 0.05), suggesting that the FA on the composite
microbubbles was conducive to its targeting in combination with the
breast cancer cell MCF-7 receptor. Thus, it could be seen that the
prepared FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles had satisfying targeting and
inhibition effects on breast cancer cells MCF-7. In addition, for
DOX/PLA microbubbles, DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles, and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubbles, their tumor inhibition rates were all higher than that
of the free DOX group, which was because the DOX being loaded inside
the microbubble and on the GO increased the drug capacity of composite
microbubbles and microbubbles encasing DOX avoided the burst release
phenomenon of the drug.

Figure 3 Inhibition rate of MCF-7 cells after the drug
treatment for 48
h in each group (n = 6); note: vs free DOX, #P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

2.2.2 MCF-7
Cell Activity
Figure 4 shows the MCF-7 cell activity
by acridine orange (AO) staining in each experimental group. AO and
intracellular DNA has a strong affinity, and their combination appears
light green. It could be seen from Figure 4a,b, for the control group and the blank
GO/PLA microbubble group, the growth state of cells were good, the
cells were plump, and the nuclei were bright green, indicating that
the DNA synthesis of the cells was active. It can be seen that the
carrier used (GO/PLA) in the experiment has no obvious cytotoxicity
on breast cancer cells MCF-7. As shown in Figure 4c–g, the free DOX, DOX/GO/PLA microbubble
group, DOX/PLA microbubble group, DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble group,
and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble group all had inhibitory effects
on cell activity. The number of cells decreased, the growth state
was poor, the morphology was slightly irregular, and the nuclear color
was weakened. Compared with other groups, the FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble
group had the most inhibitory effect on cells: the number of cells
was significantly reduced, the edge of cells was blurred, and the
color of nucleus was weakened. This was because the FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubble group added the targeting factor and could specifically
combine with the FA receptors, which increased the number of FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubbles around the cells; the increase of the amount of drugs
entering cells resulted in improvement in the inhibition rate of tumor
cells.

microbubble group, (c) free DOX group, (d) DOX/GO/PLA microbubble
group, (e) DOX/PLA microbubble group, (f) DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble

2.3 Acute Toxicity Test
After intraperitoneal
injection of composite microbubbles, the mice for the composite microbubble
group of 52.389 mg·kg–1 showed a decrease in
activity and diet and water consumption, but there was no death observed.
For the injection group of 65.486 mg·kg–1,
the activity of mice and their weight reduced, they ate less and drank
less, and one died. For the injection group of 81.858 mg·kg–1, mice showed convulsions and weight loss, and three
died. For the injection group of 102.322 mg·kg–1, the activity of mice decreased, and they presented shaking spasms
and ataxia, and eight died. All mice in the injection group of 127.903
mg·kg–1 died.

The mice death records
after injecting composite microbubbles are shown in Table 1. The median lethal dose (LD50) is calculated by using the Karber method, and LD50 was 87.529 mg·kg–1. The confidence interval
of 95% was 74.245–103.188 mg·kg–1. Results
showed that when the dose of microbubbles was less than 65.486 mg·kg–1, mice did not show the acute toxicity phenomenon.
In the application of ultrasound imaging, PLA composite microbubbles
of 40 mg·kg–1 were adopted, which indicates
that prepared UCA microbubbles have satisfactory biosafety.

2.4 Ultrasound Imaging in Vitro
In vitro
ultrasound imaging effects of the physiological saline, DOX/PLA microbubbles,
GO/PLA microbubbles, and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles are shown
in Figure 5a–d. Figure 5a shows that the
imaging of the silicone tube was blurred because of the lower echo
in the physiological saline group. As shown in Figure 5 b–d, the echo effects of the DOX/PLA
microbubble group, GO/PLA microbubble group, and FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubble group enhanced and their contrast effects remarkably improved
in comparison with those of the physiological saline group. The results
showed that the addition of FA/GO and DOX did not affect the ultrasonic
imaging effect of the PLA microbubbles, and the obtained FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubbles have excellent ultrasonic imaging characteristics in
vitro.

group, (b) DOX/PLA microbubble group, (c) GO/PLA microbubble group,
and (d) FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubble group.

2.5 Ultrasound Imaging in Vivo
The ultrasound
enhancement effect of PLA composite microbubbles in major organs of
the animal body is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the imaging effect on rabbit heart before and after intraperitoneal
injection of composite microbubbles. Before the injection, left and
right ventricular imaging was pale because the blood echo was lower,
and as a result, the left and right atria could not be presented in
ultrasonic imaging. After injection, ultrasound imaging of both left
and right ventricles became clear because of the strong echo of composite
microbubbles under the ultrasound action. Additionally, the ultrasonic
imaging showed that composite microbubbles first appeared in the right
atrium and the right ventricle and then the left ventricle and the
left atrium. Figure 6b shows the ultrasonic imaging effect on rabbit thymus before and
after the injection of PLA composite microbubbles. Before injection,
ultrasound imaging showed low contrast and blurred outline in rabbits.
After injection, the ultrasonic imaging effect on rabbit thymus was
obvious, and its outline was clear. Figure 6c shows the imaging effect on rabbit liver
before and after the injection of PLA composite microbubbles. The
echo signals of the hepatic vein, the portal vein, and the inferior
vena cava in rabbit liver were not clear before injection, but they
were obviously enhanced after injection. Ultrasonic imaging effect
on rabbit kidney before and after the injection of PLA composite microbubbles
is shown in Figure 6d. The echo signal was weak in the field of vision; the kidney boundary
was not clear before injection. After injection, there was a stronger
echo under the ultrasound effect; the kidney was fully perfused and
its boundary enhancement was clear, and the ultrasonic imaging enhanced
obviously. To sum up, the ultrasound imaging effects of PLA composite
microbubbles in solid organs such as the heart, thymus, liver, and
kidney of New Zealand rabbits were strong, which was helpful in diagnosis
and treatment.

FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA
microbubbles: (a) heart, (b) thymus, (c) liver, and (d) kidney.

The prepared composite microbubbles
had good ultrasound imaging
effect and would be able to safely cycle in the body. The vital signs
of the rabbit were stable during the process of imaging. There were
no harmful responses observed, even after imaging .

3 Conclusions
In this study, FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles
were constructed
based on the following three points: (1) DOX is a broad-spectrum antineoplastic
drug which can kill breast cancer cells. It can form a π–π
conjugation effect with GO. (2) GO is a new biosafety carrier material
which can increase the therapeutic effect by loading DOX and linking
FA. (3) The FA receptor is a high-expression receptor of the breast
cancer cell surface, and the targeting factor FA can specifically
combine with the FA receptor and does not affect normal cells. The
new PLA composite microbubbles showed excellent targeting and therapeutic
effects on breast cancer cells MCF-7 and clear ultrasound imaging.

4.3 Preparation of Targeting Drug-Loaded PLA Composite
Microbubbles
GO was prepared by using natural graphite powder
as the starting material with Hummer’s method.13 PVA was heated and dissolved in distilled water to obtain
PVA solution with a concentration of 3.5% and mixed with the proper
amount of GO, and then, the PVA was covalently grafted onto GO, and
GO/PVA compound was obtained by the esterification reaction.

A certain amount of DOX was added into the PLA methylene chloride
solution of 0.060 g·mL–1; then, N2 was introduced into the above system, treating with the ultrasonic
probe at 120 W, and the primary emulsion was formed. The primary emulsion
was added to a certain amount of the water-dispersing system of the
GO/PVA compound, and the multiple emulsion was formed through ultrasound
emulsification under 210 W; then, isopropyl alcohol solution of 5.5%
was added into the multiple emulsion, and the reaction was sustained
for 2.5 h under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After centrifugal
washing, the PLA microbubbles encasing DOX inside and loading GO on
the surface (GO/DOX/PLA) were obtained. A certain amount of DOX was
added into the above system again and stirred under dark condition
at room temperature, followed by centrifugal washing; DOX was loaded
on the GO in GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles, and DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles
were obtained. Finally, to link the targeting factor onto the microbubbles,
FA solution was added into the obtained DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles,
and they reacted under the activation effect of N-hydroxy-succinamide and carbonated diimide hydrochloride at room
temperature and in a dark environment; the targeted drug-loaded PLA
composite microbubbles (FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA) were obtained after vacuum
freeze-drying.

Blank GO/PLA microbubbles, DOX/GO/PLA microbubbles,
DOX/PLA microbubbles,
and DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles were also prepared according to the
above method.

4.4 Antitumor Activity in Vitro
4.4.1 Cell Culture
DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin was used
to cultivate breast cancer cells MCF-7 under fully saturated humidity
and 5% CO2 (v%) at 37 °C. In addition, cells were
washed 1–2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
(pH = 7.4) and digested with 0.25% trypsin. After breast cancer cells
MCF-7 were cultivated two or three generations, the best cells in
the logarithmic phase were selected for use.

4.4.2 Inhibition
Rate of MCF-7 Cells by the CCK-8
Method
After breast cancer cells MCF-7 in the logarithmic
growth phase were digested by trypsin, a single cell suspension was
obtained and the cell number was calculated. Breast cancer cells MCF-7
with a concentration of 2 × 105 number·mL–1 were inoculated in a 96-well plate at 100 μL
per well. Cells were incubated for 24 h, and the culture medium was
replaced with the serum-free medium; starvation treatment was carried
out for 12 h. A culture solution containing the drug without serum
was added per well at a concentration of 0.5–16 μmol·L–1 and a volume of 100 μL per well. The blank
well was added with an equal amount of normal culture. Cells were
cultivated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and then,
10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well and incubated
for 4 h. The absorbance of every well was measured at 450 nm by using
an enzyme standard instrument, and the cell growth inhibition rate
was calculated according to the following formula. SPSS17.0 statistical
software was used to analyze the cell growth inhibition rate of each
group, and T test and variance analyses were used
for the comparison of the different drug administration groups. *P < 0.05 indicated that the difference was significant.  

4.4.3 Observation of Cell Activity by AO Staining
Breast
cancer cells MCF-7 in the logarithmic growth phase were
digested with trypsin to prepare a single cell suspension, and cell
counts were performed. Breast cancer cells MCF-7 with a concentration
of 2 × 105 number·mL–1 were
inoculated onto a 6-pore plate at 2 mL per well. Cells were normally
cultivated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (v%), and fully saturated
humidity. The cultivation process continued for 24 h until the cells
were fully adhered to the plate. Then, the culture medium was removed
and cells were divided into the control group and drug groups. Complete
medium was added to the control group. In the drug groups, the prepared
drug solution with the complete culture medium and different composite
microbubbles were added to each well, and the DOX concentration in
each well was 4 μmol·L–1. After 4 days
of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, a certain volume
of AO solution was added into every well and the incubation process
was sustained for 10–20 min. After removing the culture medium,
cells were washed 2–3 times with PBS and photographed by using
an inverted fluorescence microscope.

4.5 Acute
Toxicity Test
All animal experiments
in the study have received protocol approval from the Institutional
Animal Protection and Use Committee of Jiamusi University. A total
of 50 SPF KM mice were selected and randomly divided into 5 groups
with 10 mice in each group. The composite microbubble suspensions
at concentrations of 52.389, 65.486, 81.858, 102.322, and 127.903
mg·kg–1, respectively, were injected into the
abdominal cavity of each group of mice. Then, acute toxicity reaction
and mortality of mice were observed under continuous observation for
7 days; the Karber method was used to calculate the value of LD50.

4.6 Ultrasound Imaging in Vitro
Before
the experiment, an appropriate amount of distilled water was degassed
for use. With the transparent elastic silicone tube (medical grade)
as the external model of the blood vessel, the degassed water was
slowly poured into the water tank; the elastic silicone tube was placed
under the water tank surface. The ultrasonic probe was submerged under
the liquid surface and faced the silicone tube. Using saline as a
blank control group, a certain amount of FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles
was dispersed in the physiological saline, and then, the physiological
saline and the FA/DOX/GO/DOX/PLA microbubbles were separately injected
into the silicone tube. The longitudinal and transverse sections of
the rubber tube were observed by pulse-inversion harmonic imaging
using the Doppler color ultrasound imaging system.

4.7 Ultrasound Imaging in Vivo
A New
Zealand white rabbit was anesthetized, and its abdomen was depilated.
The peripheral venous channel in the marginal vein of rabbit ear was
identified. A certain concentration and dose of composite microbubbles
were injected through the vein of rabbit ear, followed by washing
with a proper amount of saline. The Doppler color ultrasound imaging
system was employed to observe and record the echo intensity of the
heart, thymus, liver, and kidney of the rabbit. Experiments were conducted
in a generally acceptable ethical and humane fashion.
