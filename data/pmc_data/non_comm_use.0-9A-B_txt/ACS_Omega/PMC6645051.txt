Hitherto inaccessible multisubstituted
thiochroman derivatives
were constructed via the one-pot reaction of thiophenols with allylic
alcohols catalyzed by 0.2 equiv triflic acid under metal-free conditions.
A variety of thiochroman derivatives can be obtained by this straightforward
protocol that allows the introduction of up to four substituents at
various locations on the thiochroman skeleton. Relative conformations
of all isolated products were confirmed by NOESY NMR studies, and
a stepwise mechanism, proceeding via an allylic substitution-intramolecular
cyclization protocol, is proposed on the basis of NMR experiments.

Introduction
3,4-Dihydro-2H-1-benzothiopyrans (commonly known
as thiochromans) are one of the least explored sulfur-based heterocycles
in terms of synthetic methodologies.1 This
is indeed surprising because several thiochroman compounds, as well
as their derivatives such as thiochromones, thiochromenes, and thiochroman-4-ones,
have exhibited interesting biological activities.2 However, the synthetic protocols available for accessing
the core thiochroman motif remain relatively limited and usually entail
the use of drastic conditions (Scheme 1). The very first report in the literature involves
a ZnI2-mediated intermolecular cycloaddition between allylalcohols
and arenethiols.3 A protocol reported by
Jensen et al. (2000) requires the use of epoxide and a strong base
BuLi as key reagents.4 In 2001, Katritzky
proposed a new method for the synthesis of polysubstituted thiochromans
via the cationic cycloaddition of α-(benzotriazolyl)methyl thioether
with styrenes.5 In 2003, Skarżewski
et al. reported an alternative route which however requires an enantiopure
starting material for selective cis-thiochroman formation
via rearrangement–racemization steps.6 Nishibayashi et al., Zhao et al. (2008), and Arai et al. (2014)
have separately reported asymmetric synthesis routes, which gave excellent
yields and enantiomeric excess.7 Many of
these aforementioned protocols however often involve elaborate preformed
catalysts and substrates and/or are limited to substrates with good
Michael-acceptor ability, viz., nitroalkenes. The products in the
latter case need to undergo further reactions for removal of the directing
group. Recently, Xu et al. have reported an efficient chiral NHC-catalyzed
sulfa-Michael/Michael/lactonization cascade to synthesize a series
of chiral thiochromans bearing three chiral centers.8

Scheme 1 Selected Recent Literature Methods for Thiochroman
Synthesis
In view of our broad
interest in C–X (X = N, P, As) bond
formation protocols9 and motivated by results
from our work on functionalizing allylic alcohols by anilines using
Cu(OTf)2,10 as well as a study
by Wu et al. using Ga(OTf)3 involving direct substitution
of alcohols using sulfur nucleophiles,11 we decided to explore a new synthetic route involving substituted
thiophenols and allylic alcohols using triflic acid as the catalyst
with the hope of achieving the heterocycle of interest under metal-free
conditions (Scheme 1). Such a method is also attractive because the direct use of readily
available and low-cost allylic alcohols avoids the formation of stoichiometric
amounts of waste that is typically associated with synthesis of activated
substrates.

Results and Discussion
As aforementioned, we had previously
demonstrated the use of copper(II)
triflate, for the direct and selective synthesis of C-allylanilines via a direct allylic amination protocol from relevant
allylic alcohols and anilines.10 The 2-allylanilines
can then be readily converted under mild conditions to give substituted
quinolines via an oxidative cycloaddition reaction. We therefore decided
to explore the possibility of developing a similar protocol involving
C–S bond formation to access the targeted thiochroman motifs.
Our initial study focused on the reaction between 2,4-dimethyl thiophenol
(1a) and trans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol
(2a) under acidic media in refluxing 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) solvent (Table 1).

b All reactions were
done in the stoichiometry
of 0.75 mmol (1a)/0.50 mmol (2a) with stirring
(24 h) under reflux conditions (open air).

c Reaction was conducted in a sealed
tube, under an inert atmosphere (N2) for direct comparison
with entry 8.

d Drying agent
(MgSO4 or
molecular sieves) added.

e Yield was calculated from crude
NMR, using internal standard 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene.

Both Lewis and Brønsted acids
were tested under the same conditions
(entries 1–6). The results showed that only copper triflate
(Cu(OTf)2) successfully catalyzed the formation of the
desired product 4aa (entry 6). The other Brønsted
acids merely facilitated C–S bond coupling via nucleophilic
substitution to form product 3aa. Copper triflate in
particular and triflate salts in general have been implicated as a
hidden source of triflic acid (HOTf) in halogenated solvents.12 It was observed that, with 0.1 equiv catalyst
loading of HOTf, the reaction gave the same yield as that obtained
when copper triflate was used (entry 6 vs entry 7). Although different
solvents and various temperatures were screened (entries 11–15),
only aprotic or nonproton-acceptor solvents together with a temperature
above 80 °C induced the cyclization. Interestingly, although
thiols are known to have a propensity for oxidation, we observed insignificant
differences in resultant yields for trials done using inert conditions
in comparison to those conducted in air (entry 8 vs entry 16). The
mixture of DCE and trace amounts of water failed to facilitate the
formation of 4aa (entry 15) because triflic acid should
probably remain solubilized only in the aqueous phase. Subsequently,
the reaction was conducted with the addition of common drying agents
such as molecular sieves and magnesium sulfate (entry 17) with only
0.2 equiv of triflic acid. This resulted in a 10% increase in yield
(to 60%), and it was thus chosen as the optimum condition for the
reaction.

The structure of 4aa was confirmed by
NMR, High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS), and single-crystal X-ray crystallography
(see Supporting Information). It needs
to be noted that only the cis isomer of 4aa was selectively
obtained from the reaction. The 1H NMR spectra of the crude
also confirmed this selectivity. With the optimized conditions in
hand, we proceeded to screen for substrate tolerance for this protocol
(Scheme 2). The highest
yield of 82% was observed in the reaction between alcohol 2f and thiophenol 1b. In general, ortho-substituted thiophenols
showed slightly lower reactivity than the para-substituted isomer
(4ba and 4fa). In addition, thiols-bearing
electron-withdrawing groups gave relatively low yields (4ca, 4da, and 4ea). The reaction also showed
its applicability toward non-aromatic substituted alcohol (4ag). For meta-substituted thiophenol, the regioselectivity control
was not significant (4da and 4ea). Fluoro-substituted
thiols gave generally lower yields. Various alcohol substrates with
aryl substituents such as −OMe were tolerated with appreciable
yields therefore providing access to further functionalization of
the basic skeleton at desired positions. Reaction of 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol
with 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol allowed the generation of a thiochroman
skeletal core with four methyl substituents (4ag) via
this protocol. The relative conformation of all the isolated products
was confirmed by NOESY NMR experiments (see Supporting Information). Although the possibility of the trans-isomer
being formed cannot be conclusively ruled out in the case of 4bb, 4bd, and other unsymmetrically substituted
allylic alcohols, we were unable to isolate pure trans-isomer in any
of the cases and conclusive evidence of their presence could not be
ascertained from the crude NMR.

Scheme 2 Successfully Synthesized Thiochromans
A plausible mechanism of the
reaction is illustrated in Scheme 3. Initial protonation
of the OH functionality in the presence of acid transforms it into
a good leaving group, forming the π-allyl cationic species (A).13 Following which, nucleophilic
addition of the thiol occurs to yield the allyl thioether adduct (B). For reaction trials conducted with unsymmetrical alcohol
substrates, the regioselectivity for nucleophilic attack appeared
to be largely dependent on steric control, in which thiol addition
occurred at the sterically less hindered carbon site (4bf, 4ag, and 4bh).13 In cases with less significant steric disparity, the regioselective
pathway could have then therefore been facilitated by electronic factors,
attributed to the resultant stabilization of the electrophilic carbocationic
site via resonance from lone-pair electron donation of the respective p-Cl and p-OMe substituents (4bb and 4bd). Subsequent protonolysis of the allylic thioether
furnishes a carbocationic species (C) that can be better
stabilized by the corresponding adjacent R group from the alcohol
substrate. The reaction pathway then further translates into an intramolecular
cyclization for the eventual formation of the cyclized product (4aa). With respect to the cyclization step, the relative selectivity
could be explained by exertion of thermodynamic control that favored
the stable conformation of the cis product, which in turn minimizes
steric interaction between the two pseudo-axial substituents. This
is postulated to occur via a possible reversible C–C bond formation
involving an equilibrium process as depicted.

Scheme 3 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism
In order to obtain
experimental proof to better elucidate the mechanism, 1H NMR experiments using deuterated DCE as the solvent were
conducted. Under the reaction conditions at 80 °C, the formation
of intermediate (C) was initially observed (Figure 1); subsequently,
it undergoes an intramolecular cyclization to form (E) over time. Product (E) was not observed at any temperature
lower than 80 °C.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a one-pot, metal-free synthesis
protocol for a hitherto
inaccessible range of multisubstituted thiochroman heterocycles from
easily accessible thiophenols and allylic alcohols has been developed.
The simple triflic-acid-catalyzed protocol allows the direct use of
allylic alcohols without the need for any activation. Although the
yields obtained are moderate, the newly developed synthetic approach
to these less studies heterocyclic motifs will potentially spur further
studies into developing more efficient methods. Further studies are
currently underway to evaluate the synthesized compounds obtained
in this study and their derivatives for biological activity.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All the reactions were conducted
in open air condition (unless otherwise specified). Chemical reagents
were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further
purification. DCE was dried by molecular sieves prior to use. The
reactions were monitored by TLC (Silica gel 60 F254) and
visualized by UV (254 nm). Column chromatography was done using Silicagel
60 (size 40–63 μm) as the stationary phase. HRMS spectra
were recorded on a time-of-flight machine. NMR spectra were recorded
at 400 and 300 MHz for 1H; 100 and 75 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts (ppm) of all the peaks in 1H NMR were
calibrated to the TMS residue peak (0 ppm) in CDCl3. The
X-ray diffraction experiment was conducted with Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.7107 Å).

Representative Procedure for the Thiochroman
Synthesis
Trifluoromethasulfonic acid (0.2 mmol, 0.2 equiv,
17.6 μL)
was added into the solution of substituted thiophenol (1.5 mmol) and
allylic alcohol (1.0 mmol) in dry DCE. Magnesium sulfate powder (3.0
equiv) was subsequently added. The mixture was refluxed at 85 °C
for 24 h. Subsequently, filtration was done to remove any insoluble
residue. DCE solvent was also removed by using a rotary evaporator.
The crude product was then further purified by flash column chromatography
using hexane/ethyl acetate mixture as the eluent. After removing the
solvent, the final product was recrystallized by slow diffusion of
diethyl ether into its saturated solution in chloroform.
