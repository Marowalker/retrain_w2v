We
report the direct integration and efficient coupling of nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond
nanophotonic structures into a fiber-based photonic architecture at
cryogenic temperatures. NV centers are embedded in diamond micro-waveguides
(μWGs), which are coupled to fiber tapers. Fiber tapers have
low-loss connection to single-mode optical fibers and hence enable
efficient integration of NV centers into optical fiber networks. We
numerically optimize the parameters of the μWG-fiber-taper devices
designed particularly for use in cryogenic experiments, resulting
in 35.6% coupling efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate cooling
of these devices to the liquid helium temperature of 4.2 K without
loss of the fiber transmission. We observe sharp zero-phonon lines
in the fluorescence of NV centers through the pigtailed fibers at
100 K. The optimized devices with high photon coupling efficiency
and the demonstration of cooling to cryogenic temperatures are an
important step to realize fiber-based quantum nanophotonic interfaces
using diamond spin defect centers.

1 Introduction
Integrating
solid-state quantum nanoemitters into an optical fiber
network is of paramount importance for realizing quantum information
networks. Photons are robust against decoherence and hence suitable
for transmitting information between distant quantum information nodes
through the fiber network. The quantum information encoded in the
photonic qubits needs to be processed or converted to other qubit
media, such as electron spins1,2 or super-conducting
flux qubits,3,4 because these media seem more
suitable for information processing or storage. The quantum nanoemitters
can work as quantum phase gates or quantum transducers5,6 by mediating nonlinear photon–photon interactions7,8 or photon–spin conversions,9−11 via coherent optical
transitions between the electronic states. All solid-state quantum
nanoemitters need to be cooled to a few Kelvin to acquire the coherent
optical transitions, and therefore their implementation into fiber-integrated
devices at these temperatures is demanding.

Diamond nitrogen
vacancy (NV) centers are a good candidate as solid-state
quantum nanoemitters and quantum memories. They show stable single-photon
emission without blinking and a narrow linewidth12−14 of optical
transitions at cryogenic temperatures.15,16 Their spin-triplet
ground states have a long electron spin coherence time up to milliseconds
at room temperature.17,18 These exceptional quantum properties
have been successfully employed to realize prototypes of various quantum
devices, such as quantum registers.9,19−21 However, these demonstrations have been mostly realized in a free-space
optical setup, the implementation to fiber-based platforms is important
for future up-scaling.

Fiber integration of diamond NV centers
has been demonstrated by
coupling nanodiamonds incorporating NV centers with single-mode fibers,22−24 photonic crystal fibers,25,26 and, more promisingly,
fiber tapers.27−31 Fiber tapers have low-loss coupling with single-mode fibers and
are suitable for fiber integration of NV centers. When the taper diameter
is reduced to 300 nm, coupling efficiencies of several percent for
nanodiamond-NV centers27,28,32 and potentially up to 30% under ideal conditions32−35 can be achieved. A cryogenic
demonstration of coupling fiber tapers with nanodiamond-NV centers
was reported recently at 8 K.30 However,
the taper diameter had to be thicker (480 nm) than the optimal diameter
of 300 nm that should give the highest coupling in that experiment,
because (1) such 300 nm fiber tapers were too fragile for cryogenic
experiments, and (2) only either of the two fiber ends was available
for fluorescence collection due to a special device mounting structure
that preserves the taper transmission during the cryogenic cooling,
which reduces the coupling efficiency to half. It is thus vitally
important to find an alternative method that realizes both efficient
coupling and robustness of fiber tapers.

Recently, the coupling
of diamond micro-waveguide (μWG) structures
coupled with fiber tapers that have a relatively large diameter of
about 1.0 μm has been demonstrated by some of the authors.36 The diamond μWGs were fabricated from
high-purity type IIa bulk diamonds, where NV centers show narrow optical
transitions15,16,37 and long electron spin coherence time.17,38 The NV fluorescence is first coupled with the waveguide mode of
the diamond μWGs and is efficiently transferred to the guided
mode of the fiber tapers. The coupling efficiency of 20–40%
was shown even with 1.0 μm diameter fiber tapers, which is much
thicker than the diameter of 300 nm required for the efficient coupling
with nanodiamond-NV centers. This device concept, combining mechanically
stable taper diameters with efficient coupling via diamond μWGs,
would enable NV-based fiber-integrated quantum platforms to be operable
in a cryogenic environment.

In this paper, we report on an implementation
of NV centers into
an optical fiber network at cryogenic temperatures by using a composite
device of diamond μWGs and fiber tapers. We first present a
structural optimization of the μWG–taper devices with
numerical simulations keeping in mind the requirements for cryogenic
experiments. We then describe the device fabrication and the cryogenic
optical experiments. The μWG–taper devices can be successfully
cooled to 4.2 K without damaging fiber tapers. Sharp zero-phonon lines
of NV centers are observed through the fiber tapers at 100 K. The
present demonstration is an important step to realize fiber-integrated
diamond NV centers for quantum optical applications.

2 Device Designs
2.1 Design Concept of the μWG–Taper
Devices
We consider a cylindrical diamond μWG attached
to the thinnest region of a single-mode cylindrical silica fiber taper,
as shown in Figure 1. The dipole is placed at the center of the diamond μWG with
possible orientations either along the x, y, or z axes. We assume the emission wavelength
of the dipole to be 637 nm where the zero-phonon line of the NV center
is located. The coupling efficiency is obtained as a ratio of radiated
dipole power to the power channeled in the single guided mode of the
fiber tapers (for both fiber ends).32

Figure 1 Schematic
diagram of the structure and geometry of the simulated
model. The z axis is in contact with the waveguide
axis, and z = 0 is located at the center of the waveguides.
The diamond μWG is in contact with the fiber taper on the x axis and aligned along the z axis. The
NV center is located at z = 0 and the center of the
μWG. The optical access of the confocal microscope is along
the y axis.

Note that we use rectangular diamond μWGs in the following
experiments, which are not exactly the same as cylindrical diamond
μWGs simulated here. The difference of the cross-sectional shape
does not significantly affect the coupling efficiency. It rather changes
the effective refractive index of the fundamental hybrid mode in the
μWG–taper devices, which causes a slight shift of the
optimal interaction length between μWG and fiber taper (see
Section 1 in the Supporting Information). As long as the effective refractive indices (neff) of the waveguide modes are the same, the use of cylindrical
μWGs for the simulations is able to reproduce the most important
characteristics of the rectangular μWGs, but greatly simplifies
the model, because only the single fundamental guided modes of the
diamond μWGs and of the fiber tapers can be considered.

Note also that we consider the dipole orientation along the x axis to provide an intuitive picture of the device operation.
As described in Section 3 in the Supporting Information, the y axis dipole orientation provides very similar
coupling efficiencies with a slight shift of the optimal interaction
length (indicating neff is slightly changed).
The z axis dipole orientation only contributes less
than 0.01% to the coupling efficiency, given for a perfectly centered
dipole and therefore will be disregarded in this structural optimization.
(The z axis contribution needs to be considered if
the dipole is off-center and will be included in the theoretical estimation
of the realistic coupling efficiency presented in Section 3.1.) For these reasons, the x axis dipole orientation is used to analyze the device
properties during numerical parameter sweeps for structural device
optimization.

2.2 Optimal Diameter of the
Straight Diamond μWGs
We optimize the diameters of
the two cylindrical waveguides (diamond
μWG and silica fiber taper) and the contact length of these
two waveguides (see Methods for the simulation
procedure). The contact length is exactly equal to the diamond μWG
length (LWG) in our simulation. We begin
with varying the diameter of the diamond μWG (dWG) to analyze how the coupling efficiency changes, while
keeping the taper diameter (dFT) at 400
nm.

Figure 2 shows
a dependence of the coupling efficiency on dWG, while plotting the efficiency as a function of LWG. There are optimal LWG values that provide the maximal coupling efficiency in the
first coupling maximum. For dWG ≥
190 nm, a second efficient coupling regime appears, which indicates
that power transfer is periodic, as expected from the coupled mode
theory. Visible are fringes in the coupling efficiency caused by multiple
reflections between the two edges of the diamond μWG. The optimal LWG for the first coupling maximum is gradually
shifted from 2.7 to 1.3 μm as dWG increases.

Figure 2 Coupling efficiency of the NV dipole with the single guided
mode
of the fiber taper as a function of the diamond μWG length (LWG) and of the μWG diameter (dWG). The taper diameter is fixed to dFT = 400 nm.

The maximum coupling efficiency strongly depends on dWG. It decreases from 0.421 to 0.153 when dWG increases by only 50 nm from 170 to 220 nm
(see Section
2 in the Supporting Information for the
detailed values). This strong dependence is the result of the high
index of diamond (n = 2.4). neff of the diamond μWG fundamental mode varies from 1.18
to 1.59 when dWG = 170 → 220 nm.
As dWG increases, a portion of the electromagnetic
field that resides outside the diamond μWG decreases, thereby
reducing the coupling efficiency noticeably.

2.3 Optimal
Diameter of the Fiber Tapers
Compared to dWG, which significantly
affects the coupling efficiency, dFT only
moderately influences it. Figure 3 shows a dependence of the coupling efficiency on dFT. When we set dWG to 180 nm, dFT varied from 400 to 1000
nm. As dFT increases, longer μWG
lengths are needed to reach the maximum. The coupling efficiency stays
highest; 0.398 for dFT = 400 nm and 0.388
for dFT = 480 nm. It then gradually decreases
to 0.285 for dWG = 1000 nm, as dFT increases.

Figure 3 Coupling efficiency of the NV dipole as
a function of the μWG
length (LWG) and of the taper diameter
(dFT). The diameter of diamond μWG
is fixed to dWG = 180 nm. Note that the
fiber tapers support multiple guided modes in the region dWG ≥ ∼630 nm and we consider the coupling
efficiency only with the fundamental mode.

Note that we set dWG to 180 nm
because
it supports a hybrid-TM mode with neff = 1.414, which is very close to neff = 1.398 of the actual rectangular diamond μWGs with a cross
section of 170 × 340 nm2 (the longer side is in contact
with the taper surface). This rectangular μWG gives the most
similar dependence of the coupling efficiency on LWG to that of the cylindrical μWGs with dWG =180 nm (see Section 1 in the Supporting Information).

An important conclusion
from these simulations is that we do not
need ultrathin taper diameters to obtain the high coupling efficiency.
The coupling efficiency varies moderately with changing dFT. The difficulty of cooling fiber tapers principally
depends on dFT; a dFT smaller than 600 nm makes the experiments extremely challenging.
For diameters larger than about 600 nm, several groups have succeeded
in taper cooling to cryogenic temperatures without device break.39−42

In the present device design, the coupling efficiency of 0.307
is still available at dFT = 700 nm, where
the optimal LWG is 5.6 μm. With
this diameter, the fiber tapers do survive during the cryogenic cooling
with almost 100% success rate. As our diamond μWGs have a square
cross section of 170 × 340 nm2 with a length of 5–8
μm, they are expected to give near maximum coupling efficiency.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Room-Temperature
Characterization of μWG–Taper
Devices Incorporating Single NV Centers
Figure 4a shows the atomic force microscopy
(AFM) topography of a diamond μWG on a coverslip. The μWG
has a rectangular shape with dimensions of 0.34 × 0.17 ×
5.5 μm3 and incorporates several single NV centers. Figure 4b shows an optical
microscope image of a diamond μWG, which is placed on a fiber
taper with a diameter of about 600 nm. It is slightly inclined relative
to the taper axis. Figure 4c,d shows confocal fluorescence scanning images of the diamond
μWG, with the fluorescence detected through the microscope objective
and the fiber taper, respectively (see Methods for the experimental details).

which photons are detected through the microscope objective (c) and
the taper (d). The plots of the fluorescence intensity as a function

the taper detection (f).

In Figure 4c, there
is a single isolated fluorescence spot (pointed at with a white arrow),
which is ascribed to a single NV center by observing antibunching
in the second order autocorrelation function, as shown in the inset
of Figure 4e. The corresponding
fluorescence spot is also observed through the fiber-detection port
(Figure 4d), where
the cross-correlation between this fiber port and the objective port
shows the clear antibunching as shown in the inset in Figure 4f, indicating that single photons
are well coupled to the waveguide. Note that the fiber-detection port
is connected with the upper part of Figure 4d.

The brighter spot in Figure 4d pointed at by a dotted arrow
is located at the edge of the
diamond μWG. The strong fluorescence generated at the edges
has been reported previously;27,36 the green laser couples
more efficiently into diamond μWGs at the edges and generates
background fluorescence in the fiber. The background fluorescence
is, however, relatively weak in the other part of the diamond μWG
and may be suppressed by adjusting the excitation position and the
laser polarization.27,36

Figure 4e,f shows
the plots of fluorescence intensity as a function of the excitation
power. We fit the data with the following equation27,36 1  where R is the single-photon
count rate, R∞ is the count rate
at infinite excitation intensity, I is the excitation
intensity, ISat is the saturation excitation
intensity, and α is a parameter for linear background stemming
from the device, respectively. We obtain an R∞obj of 274
kcps and R∞1port of 132 kcps for the objective detection
and the fiber detection, respectively. In the fiber detection, α
is 8 times larger than that of the objective detection, the contribution
of which is noticeable in the high power region as the profile shows
a linear increase (Figure 4f).

The coupling efficiency ηc-method 1port1 for
the one-sided fiber port corresponding
to the upper part of Figure 4d is given by28,34,36 2  where κtp, ηAPD, and τNV are the
optical throughput between the
taper and the avalanche photodiode (APD),
the APD’s detection quantum efficiency, and the excited-state
lifetime of the NV center, respectively (method 1). With experimentally
determined values of κtp = 0.7, τNV = 12 ns, and the datasheet value of ηAPD = 0.65,
we obtain ηc-method1port1 = 0.47%.

Another method (method
2) to calculate the coupling efficiency
is based on taking into account the fluorescence quantum yield of
the diamond NV centers.34,36 In this method, the
ratio of R∞port1 to R∞obj is used with compensation
factors for the transmission in the microscope objective (κNA) and the optical transmission in the confocal microscope
(κtf). The coupling efficiency for the one-sided
fiber port is then given by 3  Given R∞obj = 274 kcps, κNA = 0.344, and κtf = 0.02, we obtain ηc-method2port1 = 0.52%. The coupling efficiencies and related parameters by these
two determining methods are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Coupling Efficiencies and Related Parameters by the Two Determining
Methods
 	method 1	method 2	
κtp	0.7	0.7	
τNV	12 ns	12 ns	
ηAPD	0.65	0.65	
R∞1port	132 kcps	132 kcps	
ηc-method1port1	0.47%	 	
κNA	 	0.344	
κtf	 	0.02	
R∞obj	 	274 kcps	
ηc-method2port1	 	0.52%	
Note
that the coupling efficiency ηc-method1,2port1 is not the total coupling efficiency
that sums for the two fiber ports, as used in Section 2. The total coupling efficiency can be obtained
by doubling ηc-method1,2port1, when the dipole is located around the z axis center. It is, however, not the case when NV centers
are located far off the center (z = 0) like in the
present experiment. As the dipole moves from the center in the z axis, the coupling efficiency changes between the two
fiber ports (see Figure S5 in the Supporting
Information). We took this asymmetric output into consideration to
compare the experimental coupling efficiency with the theoretical
ones.

By considering this asymmetric output of the fiber-coupled
fluorescence
intensity and the realistic orientation of the NV dipoles, we calculated
the range of the theoretical coupling efficiencies for this fiber
port to be 4.3–10.3% (see Section 5 in Supporting Information). The discrepancy between the experimental
data and the theoretical estimate is mainly considered to come from
κtf (the throughput of the confocal microscope),
which is challenging to determine precisely. Because the backfocal
pattern of the free-space emission collected by the microscope objective
is very different from the simple Gaussian beam (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information), the throughput at the
pinhole of the confocal microscope may significantly differentiate
from the experimental estimation. The inclined configuration of the
diamond μWG relative to the taper axis is another possible contribution
to the discrepancy.

Nonetheless, the actual number of detectable
photons from the fiber
end is half of the counts detected through the NA-0.95 microscope
objective. Such a high photon count rate has so far been challenging
to obtain for NV centers, especially in cryogenic experiments, and
is an important prerequisite of our device design for quantum optics
experiments. Note that solid-immersion-lens technology recently achieved
∼1 Mcps for single-photon detection at room temperature,43 which seems promising for cryogenic experiments.
It is, however, lossy when the single photons are coupled to single-mode
fibers, which reduces the total number of photons coupled into the
fibers.

3.2 Cryogenic Cooling of the μWG–Taper
Devices
Following the room-temperature characterization,
the devices were tested in cryogenic experiments to determine if the
cooling affects the fiber transmission of the μWG–taper
devices. Figure 5 shows
a schematic drawing of the cryogenic setup. We use a dynamic-exchange-gas
bath cryostat equipped with a confocal microscope setup. The μWG–taper
devices are mounted on a three-axis piezo stage and brought to the
focal point. The cryostat has a single aspheric lens inside the sample
chamber, which is used for the laser excitation of the devices. The
fluorescence from the NV centers is detected through the fiber taper.
A scanning mirror placed in the confocal system allows mapping of
the sample surface and imaging of the fluorescence. The μWG–taper
devices are loss-lessly coupled to pigtail fibers leading out of the
cryostat through fiber feed-throughs. One fiber-end is used for optical
detection (APD and spectrometer for NV fluorescence analysis and a
photodiode for fiber transmission measurement), and the other end
is used for launching a 670 nm red laser to measure the transmission
of the μWG–taper devices.

Figure 5 Schematic of the experimental
setup of the cryogenic experiments.
Th1 and Th2 indicate thermometers placed at the nearest sample and
the cold finger, respectively. The detection system indicates an APD
for the confocal scanning measurement, a spectrometer for the fluorescence
spectral measurement, and a photodiode for the transmission measurement.
The red laser is used to monitor the optical transmission of the devices.
L: lens, AL: aspheric lens, BSM: beam steering mirror, DBS: dichroic
beam splitter.

The devices are very
slowly cooled to 200 K over a day (−4
K per hour) by conduction cooling after the two reservoirs for liquid
nitrogen (LN2) and liquid helium (LHe) are filled with
LN2. The transmission of the fiber tapers does not change
during this time. The LN2 in the LHe reservoir is purged
by gas He and LHe is then transferred. Simultaneous pumping of the
sample chamber brings the cold gas He from the LHe reservoir to control
the cooling speed.

Figure 6a,b shows
temperature profiles measured by two thermometers (Th1 and Th2 shown
in Figure 5) during
the cooling process below 190 K. Figure 6c shows transmission profiles of tapers 1
and 2. Taper 1 suddenly breaks during the temperature change observed
at around 220 min, the time when the LHe is about to reach the cold
finger (see Section 8 in the Supporting Information for the detail). In contrast, taper 2 is not affected by the temperature
fluctuation, because we did not launch the fiber-coupled laser in
taper 2 during that time. Taper 2 finally ramps down to the LHe temperature
of 4.2 K and still supports the transmission observed at room temperature.
Our device design thus proves the robustness against cooling and preserves
the taper transmission over the course of cryogenic cooling. Note
that the transmission of ∼0.4 includes losses at the fiber
connection inserted before (after) the fiber tapers, which consisted
of an FC/PC connection and spliced points. The total insertion loss
at these connections was about 3 dB, which varied connection by connection,
but it was stable unless disconnected again.

Figure 6 Temperature profiles
during the cooling process from 180 to 4.2
K at the thermometer Th1 for (a) and Th2 for (b) (shown in Figure 5). (c) The optical
transmission profiles of taper 1 (black lines) and taper 2 (red lines)
of the fiber-coupled red laser. The dotted lines are the break during
which the measurement was not performed. Note that the first dots
of the transmission profiles at −30 min were measured 14 h
before the time 0. The data is shifted for the ease of visualization.

In addition, by repeating the
cooling experiments, we were able
to determine possible causes of the taper breaking of taper 1. We
found that the fiber tapers break when the guided red laser is turned
on at the time when the cooling speed is changed. A second case of
the taper breaking is when the cooling speed is changed by manually
adjusting the valve that controls the He flow. A change of the cooling
speed affects the internal pressure of the sample chamber, which may
cause heat accumulation in the taper waist. Fiber tapers are known
to break in vacuum when a strong laser is guided due to heat accumulation
in the taper waist.44 The present experiment
does not use a strong laser, but the tapers are stored at cryogenic
temperatures, which significantly changes the mechanical properties
of fiber tapers. It is, however, avoidable by turning off the fiber-coupled
red laser during such a time. If in-situ monitoring during cooling
is wanted, one could use single-photon-level light to monitor the
transmission in real time.

3.3 Cryogenic Characterization
of the μWG–Taper
Devices Incorporating Ensemble NV Centers
Although the single-photon
detection of NV centers has been demonstrated in the μWG–taper
devices at room temperature, most of the single NV centers in the
samples are not very stable during a long-term laser excitation run
over a day, which is an important requirement for cryogenic optical
experiments (as will be discussed in Section 3.4). We therefore used diamond μWGs
that incorporate ensembles of NV centers in the following cryogenic
optical characterizations. The optical characterization at room temperature
is shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting
Information.

Figure 7a shows a confocal fluorescence scanning image of a μWG–taper
device at 100 K, where the fluorescence photons are detected through
the fiber. The μWG contains an ensemble of NV centers and shows
bright fluorescence. The fiber taper has a diameter of about 600 nm.
As well as the scanning image at room temperature (Figure 4 for single NV centers and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information for ensemble
NV centers), the fluorescence becomes more prominent at the edges
of the μWG, due to the background fluorescence.

Figure 7 (a) Confocal fluorescence
scanning image of the μWG placed
on the taper at 100 K and (b) its fluorescence spectra. The red lines
show the one measured when the edge of the μWG is excited and
the black lines represent that at the center of the μWG.

Figure 7b shows
the fluorescence spectra, for each of which the green laser excites
the edge (black line) or the center of the μWG (red line). We
clearly observe sharp zero-phonon lines of NV centers at around 638
nm in both spectra, verifying that the μWG–taper device
is cooled to cryogenic temperatures. The inhomogeneously broadened
ensemble linewidth of the ZPL is 1.8 nm at 100 K. We measured a difference
in the longer wavelength region (λ > 680 nm) between excitation
at the edge and center. Excitation at the edge exhibits more fluorescence
intensity than at the center of the waveguide. The increase of the
fluorescence is attributed to higher background fluorescence for edge
excitation.

It should be emphasized that the present result
is the first measurement
of ZPL of NV centers in μWG–taper devices at cryogenic
temperatures. Cryogenic cooling to achieve coherent ZPL emission is
a mandatory requirement as a testbed for quantum optics experiments.
Although we still have challenges to achieve reliable device operation
at cryogenic temperature, the present results show the possibility
of using our μWG–taper devices at cryogenic temperature
for quantum information devices in the fiber network.

It should
also be mentioned that efficient integration of other
diamond color centers (SiV and GeV centers) into a different type
of fiber-coupled diamond μWG has been reported during the preparation
of this manuscript.6,45 These reports used one-sided
fiber tapers coupled with diamond μWGs standing on a wafer and
observed single-photon detection of the defect centers through the
fiber at 4 K. The use of such one-sided fiber tapers reduces the experimental
difficulty of cooling delicate fiber taper structures. The disadvantage
of these experiments, however, is the requirement to implement a reflection
mirror (like Bragg gratings) in the diamond μWGs to guide the
entire NV fluorescence to the single fiber port. Fabrication of such
Bragg gratings in the diamond nanostructures requires elaborate nanofabrication,
and it is still challenging to obtain near unity reflectance that
will be necessary to build high-Q optical cavities.

The two-sided
fiber tapers used in the present experiment are attractive
for more advanced schemes, as they can employ various well-established
fiber-based transmission and coupling methods. For example, two-sided
fiber tapers were used to demonstrate strong coupling of atomic systems
with an optical cavity just by connecting with standard fiber-Bragg
gratings in a sandwiching configuration46 or with a fiber-coupler to form a fiber ring cavity.47 Our present demonstration of cooling the μWG–taper
devices can employ these fiber-based photonic circuitries and could
replace these atom-based experiments with solid-state quantum nanoemitters.

3.4 Remaining Challenges for Reliable Device Operation
at Cryogenic Temperatures
The present results demonstrate
the cooling of the μWG–taper devices down to 4.2 K without
the loss of taper transmission and efficient fluorescence collection
from diamond NV centers at 100 K, which is an important step to realize
quantum optical devices in a fiber network. At the same time, we still
have some challenges for reliable device operation at cryogenic temperatures.

First, the fluorescence collection of zero-phonon lines of NV centers
has been realized at 100 K but not at 4.2 K. The temperature of less
than 10 K is required for obtaining the lifetime limited linewidth
of ZPL of NV centers.48 In the present
experiment at 4.2 K, the fluorescence intensity of the μWG is
weakened and only the edges show detectable fluorescence into the
fiber. The edge-excited fluorescence shows a broad emission ranging
from 550 nm to beyond 720 nm, which seems to come from sources other
than NV centers. We attribute this background fluorescence to iced
N2 (or air, namely, N2 and O2) nanoparticles
condensed on the surface of the diamond μWG. As shown in Figure S9a, we have detected a nanoparticle in
the central part of the diamond μWG at 4.2 K, which is created
during the cooling from 100 to 4.2 K. The observed background fluorescence
may therefore be ascribed to N2 iced nanoparticles condensed
on the μWG surface. Although we purged the sample chamber with
He gas, the N2 gas may be incorporated during the precooling
of the LHe reservoir by LN2. Another possible source of
nitrogen incorporation is from the fiber feed-throughs. The fiber
feed-through is a conical frustum of Teflon having a through hole
with a diameter of 0.3 mm, through which the 0.25 mm diameter fiber
is fed. Air might be incorporated through it.

Second, single
NV centers in these particular diamond μWGs
need to be more robust against photobleaching. When we characterized
single NV centers through the confocal fluorescence microscope at
room temperature, most of the single NV centers were not able to survive
under the long-term green excitation. They show stable fluorescence
in the beginning, allowing for some optical characterization such
as measurement of fluorescence spectrum or antibunching correlation,
as shown in Figure 4. However, they suddenly stop showing fluorescence and no longer
show emission (bleaching). The reason for this NV instability has
to be clarified for further cryogenic experiments, and particularly
for various quantum optics experiments. The observed change of the
fluorescence property of the ensemble NV centers during the cooling
may also be related to such NV instability.

Third, the μWGs
often drop off from the fiber tapers during
the cooling process, even though they never drop off spontaneously
at room temperature in ambient conditions. We speculate that this
is related to the change of surface adsorption strength. The μWGs
are attached to the taper through van der Waals forces. The inside
of the sample chamber is completely different to ambient conditions.
The temperature is below LN2 temperature and the humidity
is extremely low. In such conditions, the μWGs might be able
to drop off due to the imbalance between the gravity and adsorption
forces. Difference of thermal expansion between the materials (silica
and diamond) would contribute to the dropping off of the μWGs
as well as changes in surface charges. Use of electrostatic forces
by chemically charging the μWG might be helpful to prevent the
drop off.49

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a successful implementation
of NV centers into fiber-integrated diamond nanophotonic structures
at cryogenic temperatures. Diamond NV centers were integrated into
diamond μWGs, which are efficiently coupled with fiber tapers.
The μWG–taper devices were structurally optimized in
detail for cryogenic experiments. The devices were cooled to the LHe
temperature of 4.2 K without damaging the fiber tapers. The low-loss
connection to the pigtailed single-mode fibers enables clear observation
of sharp zero-phonon lines of NV centers at 100 K from the fibers.
The present demonstration is an important step to realize fiber-based
quantum nanophotonic interfaces using diamond NV centers.

5 Methods
5.1 Simulations
We employed the three-dimensional
finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method (Lumerical, FDTD package)
to obtain the coupling efficiency between NV centers and single guided
modes in the manner reported elsewhere.32,50 The refractive
indices are 2.4 and 1.45 for diamond and silica, respectively. Absorbing
perfectly matched layers (PMLs) are used as the end walls of this
computational region. The reflectivity from the PMLs is set to <1
× 10–6. The NV center dipole is placed at the
center of the diamond μWG. We assumed the emission wavelength
of the dipole to be 637 nm where the zero-phonon lines of NV centers
are located.51 The coupling efficiency
is obtained as a ratio of radiated dipole power to the power channeled
into the single guided mode of the fiber tapers (for both fiber ends).
We considered a classical electric dipole source for the NV point
dipole that emits a power of Pbulk = μ0np02ω4/12πc in a homogeneous medium of index n, where μ0, p0, and c are
the vacuum permeability, the electric dipole moment, and the speed
of light, respectively. We then calculated the time-averaged Poynting
flux  over the surface of a rectangular
box enclosing
the dipole to get the actual radiated power from the dipole owing
to the inhomogeneous environment surrounding the dipole. The spontaneous
emission rate was then given by Sbox/Pbulk. Note that NV centers do not have a linear
dipole but have two dipole moments of equal size in the plane perpendicular
to the NV axis.52−54 However, considering a single dipole is a good simplification
to provide an intuitive picture of the device operation, particularly
in Section 2. In Section 3.1, a rigorous
treatment of the NV dipole orientation was performed to provide a
theoretical coupling efficiency for the particular case in the experiments.

5.2 Device Fabrication
Fiber tapers were
fabricated from commercial single-mode optical fibers (Thorlabs, 630HP)
by a method described elsewhere.33,55 Adiabatic
tapering was confirmed as the transmittance is larger than 0.9 during
the fabrication. The taper diameter is about 600 nm. The fiber tapers
are mounted on glass plates with epoxy adhesive. These adhesives are
further reinforced by a cryogenic glue (Stycast 2850 GT).41 Note that neither epoxy adhesives nor the cryogenic
glue affect the transmission of the fiber tapers, because they only
support the plastic coating regions of the original single-mode fibers.

For the fabrication of diamond μWGs, we used two parent substrates
of type IIa CVD-grown diamond slabs (purchased from Element Six),
one containing single NV centers and a second one containing NV centers
with high density. The diamond slabs were thinned down to a final
thickness of 200 nm by reactive ion etching with Ar and Cl2 plasma. These membranes were subsequently patterned in oxygen plasma
with a transferable patterned silicon membrane as an etch mask, as
detailed in previous publications.56,57

The
diamond μWGs were first transferred to coverslips possessing
positional marking. A manual tungsten-tip manipulator was used to
pick up a diamond μWG and place it on the thinnest region of
a fiber taper. The optical propagation loss caused by the placement
of the diamond μWG is less than 10%.

5.3 Room-Temperature
Optical Experiments
The fabricated devices were characterized
at room temperature by
a confocal fluorescence microscope system together with fiber fluorescence
detection. We used a continuous-wave 532 nm laser for the excitation.
A microscope objective (numerical aperture (NA) of 0.95) was used
for both the excitation and the fluorescence collection. The fluorescence
is filtered by a dichroic beam splitter and a long-pass filter. It
is spatially filtered by a pinhole (50 μm in size) and detected
by a Hanbury Brown–Twiss setup that consists of two APDs (PerkinElmer
SPCM AQR-14) and a 50:50 beam splitter. For the fiber detection, the
residual green laser is removed by a long-pass filter and detected
by another APD. By scanning the sample mounted on a three-axis piezo
stage, we are able to obtain fluorescence scanning images in each
detection mode.

5.4 Cryogenic Optical Experiments
We
used a dynamic-exchange-gas bath cryostat (CryoVac, Konti-IT) equipped
with a home-made confocal microscope. The fiber tapers are mounted
on a cryogenic compatible three-axis piezo stage (Attocube) and brought
to the focal point. The cryostat has a single aspheric lens (EdmundOptics,
Molded aspheric lens 0.77NA 3.1 mm 600-1050 AR coated) inside the
sample chamber, and this was used for the laser excitation of the
μWG–taper devices. The fluorescence from the NV centers
is collected through the fiber and detected by an APD after passing
optical filters. The laser beam scanning is performed by a beam steering
mirror (Optics In Motion, OIM101) placed in the confocal system. After
the LHe filling, we pump out the sample chamber to cool it by guiding
the cold He gas from the LHe reservoir. The transmission of the fiber
tapers is monitored during the course of the cooling process by guiding
a fiber-coupled red laser in the fiber. Note that up to three fiber
tapers can be loaded to the cryostat at the same time. We usually
cool 2–3 tapers possessing diamond μWGs in a single cooling
operation.
