Here, a highly efficient
membrane based on electrospun polycyclodextrin (poly-CD) nanofibers
was prepared and exploited for the scavenging of various polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals from water. The poly-CD
nanofibers were produced by the electrospinning of CD molecules in
the presence of a cross-linker (i.e., 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic
acid), followed by heat treatment to obtain an insoluble poly-CD nanofibrous
membrane. The membrane was used for the removal of several PAH compounds
(i.e., acenaphthene, fluorene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and pyrene)
and heavy metals (i.e., Pb2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) from water
over time. Experiments were made on the batch sorption of PAHs and
heavy metals from contaminated water to explore the binding affinity
of PAHs and heavy metals to the poly-CD membrane. The equilibrium
sorption capacity (qe) of the poly-CD
nanofibrous membrane was found to be 0.43 ± 0.045 mg/g for PAHs
and 4.54 ± 0.063 mg/g for heavy metals, and the sorption kinetics
fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model for both types of pollutants.
The membrane could be recycled after treatment with acetonitrile or
a 2% nitric acid solution and reused up to four times with similar
performance. Further, dead-end filtration experiments showed that
the PAH removal efficiencies were as high as 92.6 ± 1.6 and 89.9
± 4.8% in 40 s for the solutions of 400 and 600 μg/L PAHs,
respectively. On the other hand, the removal efficiencies for heavy
metals during the filtration were 94.3 ± 5.3 and 72.4 ±
23.4% for 10 and 50 mg/L solutions, respectively, suggesting rapid
and efficient filtration of heavy metals and PAHs by the nanofibrous
poly-CD membrane.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water is essential for sustaining life on earth and majorly polluted
by municipal sewage discharges and industrial wastes.1,2 Particularly, the latter one contains a wide spectrum of toxic substances,
which can severely pollute clean water sources and pose a serious
threat to the human health with their highly poisonous ingredients,
for example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).3 PAHs constitute a major class of ubiquitous environmental
organic micropollutants with fused aromatic groups, which are produced
during the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.4 Because of their lipophilic nature, they are present in
the soils of industrially contaminated sites at high concentrations5 and with time, they pollute water sources and
thus threaten human health.6 Because of
their poor water solubility (∼μg/L), they are present
in water sources at ng/L concentrations.7 Even such low levels of PAHs with consistent exposure may lead to
accumulation in tissues8 and thereafter
can cause detrimental effects to the human health. In body, PAHs undergo
metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (principally, CYP1A1).9 Furthermore, being lipophilic, they can cross
cell membrane barriers and react with the cellular DNA,10 forming PAH–DNA adducts as the first
step of carcinogenesis.11 Even though the
body has their own protection control over the proofreading enzyme,
DNA polymerase, to repair DNA damages, it sometimes cannot correct
these errors during DNA replication. Thus, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has fixed 16 PAH molecules as priority pollutants,
including acenaphthene (Ace), fluorene (Flu), fluoranthene (FluA),
phenanthrene (Phe), and pyrene (Pyr) and suggested a maximum allowable
PAH concentration over benzo(a)pyrene (i.e., a carcinogenic
PAH molecule) in drinking water as 200 ng/L.12,13

Similar to PAHs, heavy metals represent another important
class of water pollutants, which are mostly discharged in industrial
wastes and severely affect human health at concentrations above their
acceptable limits. Above the critical concentrations, their presence
can be life threatening for animals and humans. For instance, cadmium
(Cd) is classified as a carcinogenic metal as many studies associated
its presence with lung, prostate, and renal cancers in humans.14 Furthermore, Cd mainly accumulates in the liver
and kidney and thus induces kidney damage.15 Likewise, lead (Pb) is a cumulative toxicant that can cause adverse
health effects on body, particularly in children as the blood–brain
barrier is less developed in children than adults, and Pb intake can
thus induce serious brain damage in them.15−17 Pb has also
shown hematological and neurological effects in humans.15 Another heavy metal nickel (Ni) is a widely
used industrial precursor, and its presence at high levels can cause
a serious threat to human health, including lung fibrosis, skin allergies,
and cardiovascular system poisoning.18 Likewise,
the higher consumption of other heavy metals also gave rise to various
health problems in human and animals, such as chronic copper (Cu)
toxicity in sheep,19 neutropenia and anemia
because of very high zinc (Zn) consumption,20 and nervous problems as a result of manganese (Mn) toxicity upon
overexposure.21

Several sorbent materials
have been developed to scavenge these toxic pollutants or minimize
their presence in water sources, particularly in the sources of drinking
water. Most strategies for PAH removal rely on the use of hydrophobic
materials, which adsorb PAH molecules through interfacial adsorption.
In this regard, Eeshwarasinghe et al. used a granular activated carbon
(GAC) for the scavenging of PAH molecules from water whose removal
by GAC took few hours.22 Recent years have
also witnessed to the development of specific removal systems for
PAHs, of which removal occurs as intercalation, π–π,
inclusion-complexation, and so forth. In this context, Topuz et al.
described a bioinspired concept using DNA-based nanogels for the scavenging
of PAH molecules from water.23 Owing to
the presence of a short diffusion pathway and interconnected matrix
of DNA chains, rapid and efficient removal of PAHs was observed. Furthermore,
for such systems, the removal process does not rely on interfacial
adsorption, but on the complete swollen network. Langer and co-authors
synthesized amphiphilic diblock copolymers for the preparation of
photosensitive core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) for the removal
of organic micropollutants, including PAHs.24 Upon exposure to ultraviolet light, the colloidal stability of the
NPs was significantly decreased by the removal of the protective layer
and large aggregates were formed with the adsorbed pollutants. Another
interesting strategy for PAH removal was developed by Stoddart group
who synthesized a semi-rigid cyclophane with a shape of a box-like
using 1,4-phenylene-bridged bipyridinium units.25 The molecule was used for the removal of various PAH molecules,
which formed inclusion-complexation with the cyclophane cavity. Likewise,
cyclodextrin (CD)-functional materials were also used to remove PAHs
from aqueous solutions through mostly host–guest inclusion
complexation.26,27 Recently, Dichtel and co-authors
synthesized a porous β-CD polymer using tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile
as a cross-linker for the scavenging of water micropollutants, including
PAH derivatives, that is, 2-naphthol and 1-naphthyl amine, from water.28 Because of the highly porous structure of the
β-CD polymer and high affinity of CD molecules toward organic
micropollutants, the β-CD-based polymeric material could rapidly
scavenge organic micropollutants in few minutes. Similarly, various
sorbents have been produced to get rid of heavy metals from water,
including an eco-fabricated magnetic filter with mesh architectures
composed of a soft magnetic material (Ni Zn) Fe2O4 and poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc)-coated quasi-superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs, which could decrease the concentrations
of Pb2+ and Ni2+ from 1 to 0.01 mg/L for Pb2+ and 0.02 mg/L for Ni2+,29 graphene oxide nanosheets with the maximum sorption capacities of
106.3 and 68.2 mg/g for Cd2+ and Co2+, respectively,30 polydopamine/bacterial nanocellulose membrane
for highly efficient removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+,31 and poly(amic acid) (PAA)-based vesicles
for the removal of Ni2+ (from 58.7 to 0.095 ppm), Cu2+ (from 63.5 to 2.47 ppm), Zn2+(from 65.4 to 0.58
ppm), and Pb2+ (from 207.2 to 0.87 ppm) in the presence
of 1.0 mg/mL PAA vesicle.32

The production
of CD-functional nanomaterials aimed at environmental applications
has grown significantly in the last decade to snare various organic
micropollutants, including PAHs, from water.33−39 Particularly, CD-functional electrospun nanofibers have sparked
great interest for the scavenging of PAHs because of their high surface
to volume ratio and highly porous structure for enhanced sorption
performance. In this regard, we previously reported CD-grafted cellulose
acetate nanofibers for PAH scavenging.40 The incorporation of CD molecules via click reaction enhanced the
sorption performance of cellulose acetate nanofibers. Likewise, CD-decorated
polyester nanofibers were prepared by the post-modification of polyester
nanofibers with CD using citric acid (CA) as a coupler.41 CD functionalization improved the PAH-removal
performance of pure polyester nanofibers. Recently, we developed a
high-performance, water-insoluble nanofibrous poly-CD membrane cross-linked
by a carboxylic acid-based cross-linker for the sequestration of methylene
blue (MB) dye.42 Because such nanofibers
were only composed of CD and cross-linker, they showed very high sorption
performance in the scavenging of MB from aqueous solutions. Likewise,
an insoluble poly-CD fibrous mat was produced by cross-linking with
epichlorohydrin as a highly efficient sorbent material for the removal
of phenanthrene.43 CD-functional nanofibers
were also used for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions.
In one example, nonwoven poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) coated
with β-CD-polycarboxylic molecules [i.e., CA, 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic
acid (BTCA) and poly(acrylic acid)] was used for the removal of four
heavy metals (i.e., Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+) from water.44 Depending
on the type of carboxylic component, the materials showed different
removal performance. The highest removal capacity was observed when
BTCA was used for CD decoration. Thus, the presence of carboxylic
groups in CD fibers allows their use for the removal of heavy metals,
whereas accessible CD cavities can make host–guest inclusion
complexation with PAH molecules.

In this study, electrospun
CD nanofibers were prepared by the electrospinning of hydroxypropyl
β-CD (HP-β-CD) molecules in the presence of a tetracarboxylic
acid-functional cross-linker and sodium hypophosphite as an initiator.
The cross-linking of the CD nanofibers led to an insoluble, hydrophilic
nanofibrous poly-CD membrane, which was used for the scavenging of
several PAHs (i.e., Ace, Flu, FluA, Phe, and Pyr) and heavy metals
(i.e., Pb2+, Ni2+ Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) from water over time. The
sorption performance of the PAHs was explored over batch sorption
experiments by the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
analysis, whereas inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS was used to
monitor the removal of the heavy metals by the poly-CD membrane. Furthermore,
the filtration performance of the membrane for both types of pollutants
was tested through a dead-end filtration system, and the stability
of nanofibers after the filtration was explored over morphological
analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of the Poly-CD
Nanofibrous Membrane by Electrospinning
The nanofibrous CD
membrane was prepared by the electrospinning of aqueous solutions
of HP-β-CD molecules in the presence of the cross-linker and
initiator, following our previous method (Figure 1a).42 After an
appropriate time of electrospinning, a nanofibrous CD mat with a suitable
thickness/size was produced. The mat was cross-linked with heat treatment
at 175 °C for 1 h, which led to the formation of a nanofibrous
poly-CD membrane (Figure 1b). The resultant membrane was a self-standing and handy material
and could be folded without any structural damage, demonstrating its
suitability for sorption applications. Figure 1c shows the SEM image of the nanofibers and
the water wettability of the membrane surface. The mean fiber diameter
was calculated as 480 ± 300 nm for the nanofibrous poly-CD membrane
(Figure 1c). Owing
to the hydrophilic nature of the poly-CD membrane, the water droplet
spreads across the membrane surface [Figure 1c (inset)]. This can be attributed to the
hydrophilic nature of both components (HP-β-CD and BTCA) in
the resultant cross-linked network (Figure 1d,e). The cross-linking of the HP-β-CD
molecules by BTCA was confirmed by the XPS analysis. Figure S1 shows the deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectra of the HP-β-CD
mat and poly-CD membrane. The deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectra of the
poly-CD membrane show a peak related to O–C=O of the
reacted and unreacted carboxyl groups as well as the formed ester
bonds at 289.10 eV. On the other hand, this peak is not visible for
the HP-β-CD fibers. Furthermore, the ratio of C–C and
C–H bonds (appeared at 284.85 eV) significantly increases from
29.93 to 37.56% after cross-linking. The reaction between carboxylic
acid and hydroxyl group produces H2O as a by-product, which
decreases O content in the overall composition (Table S1). The cross-linking of the nanofibers did not show
any significant change on the XRD pattern of the HP-β-CD mat,
whereas the electrospinning of HP-β-CD nanofibers increased
the amorphous structure of HP-β-CD molecules because of their
random organization during the electrospinning process (Figure S2). The intensities of broad peaks of
HP-β-CD molecules centered at 18.84 (d-spacing:
4.67 Å) and 10.55° (d-spacing: 8.55 Å)
significantly decreased after the electrospinning process (Figure S2).

network in the membrane.

2.2 Adsorption Kinetics
The poly-CD membrane
was used for the removal of several PAH compounds (i.e., Phe, FluA,
Ace, Flu, and Pyr) from water (Figure 2a). During the sorption experiments, the membrane was
treated with the mixed solutions of five different PAHs over time
to explore the sorption kinetics as well as their affinity to form
inclusion complexes with functional CD molecules. The aqueous solubility
order of the respective PAH molecules is as follows: Ace (1.93 mg·L–1) ≥ Flu (1.90 mg·L–1) > Phe (1.20 mg·L–1) ≫ FluA (0.26
mg·L–1) ≫ Pyr (0.077 mg·L–1) > Ant (0.076 mg·L–1).45 The initial concentration of the PAH solution was kept
at 400 μg/L (i.e., the concentration of each PAH was 80 μg/L
in the respective mixture), which decreased significantly over time
due to the formation of inclusion complexes with active CD molecules
and the adsorption of PAHs on hydrophobic domains in the poly-CD fibrous
network. On the course of the PAH treatment, samples were taken from
PAH solutions at certain intervals and measured by GC–MS. Figure 2b shows the PAH-sorption
performance of the membrane as a function of time. The removal efficiency
showed variations for each PAH molecule because of differences in
the binding affinity of the PAHs to the CD cavity. Even after 10 min,
the PAH content decreased over 30% for all PAHs tested, demonstrating
the presence of high-functional CD content in the membrane. The highest
removal efficiency was observed for fluoranthene (FluA) with a significant
concentration decrease (i.e., over 60%). This may be attributed to
the high affinity of HP-β-CD molecules toward FluA. A similar
finding was reported by our previous study, where we observed the
highest sorption capacity for FluA when poly-CD cryogels were used
as sorbent materials.26 After 20 min, the
removal efficiency reached 50%, suggesting rapid scavenging of PAHs
by the poly-CD membrane due to the presence of functional CD molecules
(i.e., CD molecules that can make host–guest complexation)
(Figure 2c) and unspecific
adsorption of PAHs on hydrophobic domains in the poly-CD fibrous matrix.
The equilibrium sorption was observed after 60 min, whereas no significant
increase in the sorption was observed up to 360 min, suggesting that
the system reached saturation, and at this point, the mean removal
capacity of the five PAHs was found to be 78.1 ± 7.7%. The affinity
of the poly-CD membrane toward PAHs was found in an order of FluA
> Pyr > Phe > Flu > Ace. The lowest removal efficiency
was observed for acenaphthene (Ace) among the PAHs tested. In this
regard, Morillo et al. reported the enhanced solubilization of various
PAHs by different synthetic CDs [HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD, and
randomly methylated (RM) β-CD] for remediation applications.45 They observed that the binding constant (Kc) of PAHs with HP-β-CD follows the following
order: Phe > FluA > Flu > Pyr > Ace. The lowest Kc was observed for Ace, which is in agreement
with our sorption finding. After 3 h treatment, the lowest removal
efficiency was observed for Ace by the nanofibrous poly-CD membrane
(Figure 2b). On the
other hand, the highest removal was observed for FluA after 3 h, followed
by Phe, whereas they observed the highest binding affinity for Phe
when they use HP-β-CD molecules. In this study, we use poly(HP-β-CD)
networks for the removal of PAHs. The cross-linking of HP-β-CD
molecules can change the cavity size of the CD molecules. In this
regard, it was reported that the methylation of β-CD increases
the cavity volume by 10–20% as a result of enhanced depth of
the cavity up to 10–11 Å;46 therefore, RM β-CD showed higher solubility of PAHs than HP-β-CD.45 Given that the possible enhanced cavity volume
because of cross-linking, the poly-HP-β-CD, unlike HP-β-CD,
can show different binding affinities for PAH molecules. In addition
to inclusion-complexation with functional CD molecules, unspecific
adsorption of PAHs on the hydrophobic domains takes place, which may
change the sorption capacity for a specific PAH molecule. The poly-CD
membrane was also used for the removal of six different heavy metals
(i.e., Pb2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) from water. The removal efficiencies
of heavy metals as a function of time are shown in Figure 2d. About 40% removal was observed
after 5 min treatment, suggesting rapid and efficient removal of heavy
metals by the poly-CD membrane. Interestingly, at that time, the removal
efficiency for Pb was higher than 70% because of very high affinity
of Pb toward the unreacted carboxyl groups and the oxygen of carbonyl
groups (the polarity of the C=O bond induces a partial negative
charge on the oxygen group). After 6 h treatment, the adsorption reached
to equilibrium (Figure 2e).

the possible electrostatic interaction between carboxyl group and

The sorption kinetics
gives an assessment regarding equilibrium sorption time and capacity
as well as insights into kinetics mechanism. The sorption mechanism
of PAHs and heavy metals was explored by plotting the sorption kinetics
according to the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models (Figure 3). The respective
kinetics parameters are given in Table 1. R2 values were found
as 0.9732 and 0.9577 according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model
(Figure 3a,c). However,
a better fit was observed for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model
with R2 of 0.9996 and 0.9942 for PAHs
and heavy metals, respectively (Figure 3b,d). According to the pseudo-second-order model, the
equilibrium adsorption capacities (qe)
were calculated as 0.31 ± 0.030 and 4.54 ± 0.063 mg/g for
PAHs and heavy metals, respectively, which are in line with the experimental
findings (qexp, Table 1). A similar kinetic model was observed for
the β-CD-grafted activated carbon during the adsorption of the
simplest PAH molecule, naphthalene.47 Because
the sorption of PAHs onto CDs mainly takes place as through clathration
and hydrophobic interactions, the inclusion process was influenced
greatly by the shape, size, and polarity of the guest PAH molecule.
Thus, the rate constant k2 value for PAHs
is controlled by the clathration.

PAH concentration was 400 μg/L. (c) Pseudo-first-order kinetic
and (d) pseudo-second-order kinetic plots for heavy metal removal

heavy metals	4.351 (±0.078)	2.600	0.0029	0.957	4.536	1.3 × 10–2	0.9942	
The
PAH-removal process can be explained by the formation of inclusion
complexes between CD and PAHs as well as adsorption of PAHs onto hydrophobic
domains in the poly-CD fibrous matrix. Figure 4a shows the PAH-removal efficiency from aqueous
solutions using the poly-CD membrane in the presence of various PAH
concentrations (i.e., 200, 400, and 600 μg/L). The PAH-removal
performance increased proportionally with respect to the PAH content.
Even at the PAH concentration of 600 μg/L, the mean removal
efficiency of the membrane was above 80%, suggesting the efficient
scavenging of the PAHs. The equilibrium sorption capacity was found
as 0.43 ± 0.045 mg/g material when the PAH concentration was
600 μg/L. For all concentrations, the highest removal was observed
for FluA, followed by Pyr, whereas the lowest removal was observed
for Ace. Differences in the removal efficiencies can be ascribed to
the binding affinity of CD molecules toward the respective PAH. On
the other hand, the removal of heavy metals mainly takes place electrostatically
over carboxylic and carbonyl groups. The poly-CD membrane was used
for the scavenging of heavy metals of various concentrations (1, 5,
10, and 50 mg/L) (Figure 4b). For three concentrations (1, 5, and 10 mg/L), the membrane
showed identical removal efficiency, whereas a significant decrease
in the removal efficiency was observed with increasing the heavy metals
concentration to 50 mg/L. However, even at this concentration, the
removal efficiency for Pb ions was 90%, demonstrating the high affinity
of Pb ions to the membrane.

Figure 4 Equilibrium removal efficiency (%) of (a) PAHs
and (b) heavy metals by the poly-CD membrane at various concentrations
of pollutants.

The reusability of the
membranes is highly critical by the reason of monetary and environmental
issues. In this regard, the nanofibrous poly-CD membrane is a handy
material and could be separated from the adsorbed PAHs and heavy metals
through a simple washing with acetonitrile or a 2% nitric acid solution,
respectively. The reusability of the membrane was explored up to four
times, and after each use, the removal of the adsorbed PAHs from the
membrane was carried out by washing the membrane with acetonitrile.
During repetitive use, the removal efficiency for PAHs was found between
70 and 80% after each use, demonstrating their reusability (Figure 5). Likewise, the
reusability of the membrane for heavy metal scavenging was explored.
In this case, the leached metals could also be measured after the
treatment with 2% nitric acid. Thereafter, the reuse of the membrane
for heavy metal removal showed a small loss in the sorption performance.
This can be attributed to that not all bound heavy metal ions are
leached from the fiber matrix so that the removal efficiency slightly
decreased. After repetitive use, the morphology of the poly-CD membrane
was explored by SEM (Figure 5b,d), where fibers were swollen to some extent, but the fibrous
structure of the membrane was maintained.

or 2% nitric acid solution (for heavy metals). Scanning electron micrographs

and (d) 2nd use for heavy metal sorption.

2.3 Filtration Performance of the Poly-CD Membrane
Although the fibrous structure of the poly-CD membrane was maintained,
fibers were swollen because of water diffusion in the hydrophilic
matrix of the poly-CD during their use in aqueous solutions. Increasing
cross-linker concentration or incubation temperature during the fabrication
of the membrane can lead to more stable poly-CD nanofibers. Owing
to its structural stability during the sorption tests, the filtration
performance of the membrane for both PAHs and heavy metals was explored
using a dead-end filtration system. In the filtration tests, the membrane
was transferred into a high-pressure cell [HP4750 (Sterlitech)] and
50 mL of PAH solutions (having concentrations of 400 and 600 μg/L)
or 50 mL of heavy metals (having concentrations of 10 and 50 mg/L)
passed through the membrane with an active filtration area of 14.6
cm2 under a certain N2 pressure at 104 Pa (Figure 6). This
pressure was reported to be an optimum pressure for the poly-CD membrane
according to our previous study for the filtration of MB.42 The removal efficiencies for PAHs were calculated
as 92.6 ± 1.6 and 89.9 ± 4.8% for the solutions containing
400 and 600 μg/L PAHs, respectively (Table 2). These results are in line with the sorption
values obtained at the equilibrium. For heavy metals, the removal
efficiencies were calculated as 94.3 ± 5.3 and 72.4 ± 23.4%
for 10 and 50 mg/L solutions, respectively. Even though the filtration
experiments were performed in 40 s for 50 mL stock solutions, this
high performance can be attributed to the presence of functional CD
molecules and as well unspecific adsorption of PAHs on the hydrophobic
segments in the poly-CD fibrous matrix. Furthermore, XPS analysis
was performed on the membranes used for the filtration of heavy metals
of two different concentrations (10 and 50 mg/L) (Figure S3). The most prominent intensities were observed for
Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+, demonstrating
higher adsorption of these metal ions by the poly-CD membrane. In
general, the intensity levels were nearly correlated with the removal
efficiency values of metal ions (Figure 4b). Additionally, the intensity belonging
to respective metals increased distinctively as the concentration
increased from 10 to 50 mg/L, demonstrating the higher adsorbed amount
of heavy metals onto the poly-CD membrane (Figure 4b). The presence of carboxyl and carbonyl
groups enhanced the sorption performance for heavy metals, and the
nanofibrous poly-CD membrane could rapidly scavenge metal ions from
water.

inserted in the high-pressure Sterlitech HP4750 cell, and the pollutant
solution (50 mL) was added and passed through the membrane with an
active filtration of 14.6 cm2 under N2 pressure
(104 Pa). The filtered solution was collected in a beaker.

Furthermore, the flux (F) and permeability (Pw) are

were calculated as 237 ± 80 L m–2 h–1 kPa–1 and 3090 ± 500 L m–2 h–1 for PAHs, whereas they were calculated as
245 ± 70 L m–2 h–1 kPa–1 and 3358 ± 365 L m–2 h–1 for heavy metals, respectively (Table 2). Furthermore, no flux fluctuation
was observed during filtration, and the process was completed with
a stable permeation flux. These values are much higher than most of
the electrospun membranes used for water depollution and desalination.
In one example, Obaid et al. produced membranes based on amorphous
silica NP-incorporated poly(vinylidene fluoride) electrospun nanofiber
mats for water desalination.48 The membrane
showed water flux of 83 L m–2 h–1 and salt rejection of 99.7% for 2 M NaCl draw solution. Dobosz et
al. used electrospun nanofibers of cellulose or polysulfone with ultrafiltration
membranes for the removal of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules
of various molecular weights.49 The membranes
showed very high water flux (∼1200 L m–2 h–1) at the pressure of 1.5 bar. Even though in the presence
of such high pressure, this water flux is lower than the nanofibrous
poly-CD membrane, which has flux over 3000 L m–2 h–1 at 10 kPa (0.1 bar) (Table 2). Rejection was found to be related to the
molecular weight of PEGs, and the membranes showed selective rejection
to higher molecular weights of PEGs (Mw > 150 kDa) with rejection over 80%. Coelho et al. produced membranes
from electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(catechol) nanofibers
on a poly(vinylidene fluoride) basal disc for the filtration of reactive
Red 66 monoazo dye from distilled water and seawater.50 The membranes showed an average flux rate of 70 L m–2 h–1 for distilled water and 62
L m–2 h–1 for seawater at 4 bar.
The respective rejection rates were found to be 85 and 64% for distilled
water and seawater. Dong et al. produced superhydrophobic membranes
based on fluoroalkylsilane-grafted PVA nanofibers.51 The membranes showed high permeate flux of 25.2 kg m–2 h–1 and have potential for their
use in water desalination. An interesting nanofibrous membrane was
developed by Chu and co-workers by incorporating cellulose nanowhiskers
into electrospun PAN and PET nonwoven substrates.52 The incorporation of cellulose nanowhiskers significantly
enhanced the adsorption capacity of the membrane by 16 times. The
PAN electrospun membrane showed water flux of 83 L m–2 h–1 kPa–1, whereas cellulose
nanowhiskers incorporated electrospun membrane showed water flux of
59 L m–2 h–1 kPa–1 which is much lower than the nanofibrous poly-CD membrane. Overall,
the poly-CD membrane has very high permeability and water flux and
is superior to most of the electrospun membrane reported in the literature.

2.4 Stability of the Poly-CD Membrane
The morphology
of the poly-CD membrane after its use several times is shown in Figure 5b,d where the samples
maintained their fibrous structure, suggesting the structural stability
of the membrane due to efficient cross-linking reactions between CD
and BTCA. The morphology of the nanofibers was also explored after
the filtration tests (Figure 7). Figure 7a,b shows the SEM photos of the poly-CD membranes after their use
in the filtration of PAHs at two different concentrations (400 and
600 μg/L). For both cases, the fibrous structure of the poly-CD
membrane was maintained, but the swelling of nanofibers was observed:
the mean fiber diameter increased from 400 ± 350 to 970 ±
680 and 920 ± 550 nm after treatment with 400 and 600 μg/L
PAH solutions, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the
poly-CD nanofibers treated with heavy metals at two different concentrations
(10 and 50 mg/L): the mean diameter of the fibers increased to 1250 ±
730 and 1000 ± 560 nm, respectively. The preservation of the
nanofibrous structure of the poly-CD membrane after filtration tests
suggests the structural stability of the poly-CD nanofibers because
of their highly cross-linked structure. Owing to the hydrophilic nature
of components, nanofibers in the poly-CD membrane were swollen to
some extent while maintaining the fibrous structure. This could be
attributed to the presence of efficient cross-linking between the
HP-β-CD and BTCA. Nevertheless, a more robust nanofibrous poly-CD
membrane can be fabricated by tuning of cross-linking efficiency and
cross-linking density over process parameters and concentrations of
precursors.

after its use in the filtration test for PAHs of concentrations of
(a) 400 and (b) 600 μg/L and heavy metals of concentrations
of (c) 10 and (d) 50 mg/L. Insets show the size distribution plots
of the respective fibers.

3 Conclusions
The nanofibrous poly-CD
membrane was produced and exploited for the scavenging of several
PAH molecules and heavy metals from water. The SEM analysis of the
poly-CD membrane revealed the bead-free fiber structure, which could
maintain its nanofibrous structure in water because of the densely
cross-linked CD network structure. The nanofibrous poly-CD membrane
successfully removed several PAHs (i.e., Flu, Ace, Pyr, Phe, and FluA)
and heavy metals (i.e., Pb2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) from water
with the equilibrium sorption capacities of 0.43 ± 0.045 and
4.54 ± 0.063 mg/g for PAHs and heavy metals, respectively. The
sorption took place according to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model
and reached to equilibrium in 60 min, whereas the membrane could reduce
PAH and heavy metal content by half in 20 min, suggesting rapid and
efficient removal of the PAHs and heavy metals from water. Furthermore,
during the filtration, the poly-CD membrane could rapidly reduce the
PAH content by ca. 90% in 40 s when the solutions with PAH concentrations
of 400 and 600 μg/L were used. A similar performance was observed
during the filtration of heavy metals. The SEM analyses of the nanofibrous
poly-CD membrane after the filtration and sorption tests revealed
that the fiber morphology was maintained to some extent. Because of
the nanofibrous and handy structure, the poly-CD membrane is a suitable
sorbent material for the removal of PAHs or heavy metals from water.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
HP-β-CD
with a molar substitution between 0.6 and 0.9 was kindly received
as a gift from Wacker Chemie AG (Germany). Sodium hypophosphite hydrate
(SHP, Sigma-Aldrich), BTCA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), PAHs [acenaphthene
(Ace, 99%), fluorene (Flu, 98%), fluoranthene (FluA, 98%), phenanthrene
(Phe, 98%), and pyrene (Pyr, 98%)], and heavy metals (zinc(II) acetate,
manganese(II) acetate, lead(IV) acetate, cadmium(II) acetate, copper(II)
acetate, and nickel(II) acetate) were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
High-purity water was produced from a Millipore Milli-Q system (resistivity ≥
18 MΩ cm).

4.2 Production of the Poly-CD
Nanofibrous Membrane by Electrospinning
The nanofibrous poly-CD
membrane was produced according to our previous method.42 Briefly, HP-β-CD with a concentration
of 140% (w/v) was dissolved in water, and afterward, the cross-linker
(BTCA, 20 wt % according to the CD content) and initiator (SHP, 2%
according to the CD content) were added. The solution was held at
50 °C under continuous stirring for few minutes. Thereafter,
the solution cooled down to room temperature and transferred into
a syringe having a metallic needle of an inner diameter of 0.45 mm.
The syringe put on horizontally in a KDS-101 model syringe pump (KD
Scientific), and a high voltage power (Matsusada Precision, AU Series)
was applied. The nanofibers were collected on a metal collector covered
with an aluminum foil. During the electrospinning, the following parameters
were used: the applied voltage of 10 kV, the flow rate of 1 mL/h,
and a tip-to-collector distance of 10 cm. The electrospinning was
performed at 24 °C in the presence of 25–30% relative
humidity. The nanofiber mat put in an oven and kept at 175 °C
for 1 h for the cross-linking reactions and, thereafter, treated with
water and ethanol/acetonitrile to remove unreacted precursors. A pristine
nanofibrous HP-β-CD mat without using BTCA and SHP was also
prepared to explore the influence of cross-linking process on the
morphology of HP-β-CD fibers by SEM and phase identification
of HP-β-CD molecules over XRD analysis. The electrospinning
of HP-β-CD at 160% (w/v) from aqueous solution resulted in a
HP-β-CD nanofibrous mat. The electrospinning parameters for
HP-β-CD nanofibers were as follows: tip-to-collector distance
was 15 cm, the flow rate set to 0.5 mL/h, and the applied voltage
was 15 kV.

4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The fiber morphology was explored by SEM (Quanta 200 FEG, FEI).
The fiber specimens were coated with 5 nm Au/Pd with a PECS-682 sputter.
The mean fiber diameter was determined from the SEM images over 100
nanofibers by ImageJ software (NIH, US National Institutes of Health).

4.4 Sorption Tests
4.4.1 PAH-Sorption
Tests
The scavenging of PAH molecules was monitored using
a GC–MS (model 7890A) coupled to a 5975C inert MSD with a Triple-Axis
detector (Agilent Technologies). Before the loading of the filtered
solutions to the detection system, PAH molecules were separated from
an aqueous environment to hexane by a liquid–liquid extraction.
Afterward, the hexane solution (1 μL) was injected to GC–MS
by an injector (MSU 011-00A, volume = 10 mL, scale = 54 mm). An HP-5MS
(Hewlett-Packard, Avondale, PA) capillary column (30 m × 0.25
mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness) could separate compounds. The
temperature of the column was maintained at 80 °C for 2 min and
increased to 250 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min and then equilibrated
at this temperature for 2 min. A carrier gas (He) with a flow rate
of 1.2 mL/min was exploited. The splitless mode was used for the thermal
desorption. The temperature of the transfer line and ion source was
kept at 290 and 230 °C, respectively. A complete scanning mode
(SCAN) was used to determine all PAH peaks. During the measurements,
the selected ion monitoring was implemented. The retention time of
Ace, Flu, FluA, Phe, and Pyr was 11.09, 12.27, 17.33, 14.51, and 17.84
min, and the major peaks of the PAHs were 153.1, 166.1, 202.1, 178.1,
and 202.1 mass over charge, respectively. The results were adapted
to calibration curves, which were obtained for the PAH concentrations
of 200–600 μg/L with R2 ≥
0.99 linearity and acceptability over the peak areas under curves.
The adsorption of PAHs on different glass containers was also explored,
and the partial adsorption of the PAHs on the glass surface was observed
to some extent (Figure S4). The lowest
adsorption was observed for GC–MS vials that were used for
sorption experiments.

4.4.2 Heavy Metal Sorption
Tests
A Thermo-X series II inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer was used to measure heavy metal concentrations during
the removal experiments. To prevent the precipitation of metal ions,
test solutions were diluted with 2% nitric acid solution. The calibration
curve was made of five different concentrations of standard metal
ion solutions (25–1000 μg/L) with the R2 ≥ 0.99 acceptability. The ICP-MS operating parameters
were dwell time: 10 000 ms, channel per mass: 1, acquisition
duration: 7380, channel spacing: 0.02, and carrier gas: argon.

4.5 Batch Sorption Experiments
Batch adsorption
experiments were carried out by shaking at 160 rpm on a magnetic stirrer
(IKA-KS 130, Germany). The stock solutions of PAHs were prepared from
the mixture of PAHs, that is, Ace, Flu, FluA, Phe, and Pyr. The analysis
of batch adsorption tests was performed by using GC–MS. On
the other hand, for heavy metal removal experiments, 5 mg of adsorbent
and 5 mL of metal ion solutions consisted of Pb2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and
Cu2+ were used. Kinetic experiments were performed under
the conditions of 5 mg/L concentrated heavy metal ion solution.

Because of the poor water solubility of the PAHs, the experiments
were performed according to their solubility limits in water. In this
regard, 200, 400, and 600 μg/L concentrated solutions were prepared
and used in the removal tests. Poly-CD membranes (∼5 mg) were
immersed in 5 mL of 400 μg/L PAH solution (i.e., 80 μg/L
of each in the resultant mixture) and shaken at room temperature,
and time-dependent removal of the PAHs by the membrane was monitored.
The removal efficiency (%) of the PAHs and heavy metals by the membrane
was determined using the following equation 1  where c0 and ct are the initial and residual concentrations of the
PAHs (or heavy metals) in the stock solution and filtrate, respectively.
The sorption capacity (qe) of the membrane
was explored for the PAH concentrations of 200, 400, and 600 μg/L,
whereas heavy metals with concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg/L
were used, and qe values were determined
with the following formula 2  where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the PAHs (or heavy
metals) in the test solution (mg/L), V is the volume
of the testing solution in L, and w is the membrane
weight in g.

The pseudo first-order and pseudo-second-order
kinetics models are used to explore the kinetics behavior of the sorption
as given in eqs 3 and 4, respectively. 3   4  where qt and qe (mg/g) are the sorption capacity at time t and equilibrium, respectively. The pseudo-first-order model rate
constant k1 (min–1)
and pseudo-second-order kinetics k2 (g/mg
min) were calculated from the equations.

For reusability test,
the PAH-treated poly-CD membrane (5 mg) was washed with acetonitrile
to remove the adsorbed PAHs from the membrane. Then, the membrane
was reused for the sorption experiments. After the sorption tests,
the fiber morphology was explored by SEM. On the other hand, the membrane
was washed with 2% (v/v) nitric acid solution for the removal of the
adsorbed metal ions. Afterward, the same membrane was immersed in
fresh metal ion solutions (5 μg/L to 5 mL) to reveal the reusability
of poly-CD nanofibers. In addition, the leached amount of metal ions
(μg/L) was also detected. Each experiment was repeated three
times. The ICP-MS technique was used to examine the results of metal
ion removal experiments. After batch adsorption studies, the morphology
of the poly-CD membrane was explored by SEM analysis.

4.6 Filtration Test of the Poly-CD Membrane
A dead-end
filtration system was used to explore the filtration performance of
the membrane using a high-pressure cell (Sterlitech HP4750, Sterlitech
Corporation, Kent, WA). The HP4750 system has a volume of 300 mL and
is pressurized with nitrogen. The cell possesses an active membrane
area of 14.6 cm2. A pressure gauge and regulator were used
to tune the purge pressure in the cell. The rounded membrane with
a diameter of 5 cm put in the cell. Prior to the filtration tests,
the membrane was conditioned and pressurized with distilled water
at 104 Pa pressure to able get accurate results. Thereafter,
the PAH or metal ion solution (50 mL) transferred into the cell, and
the cell pressure kept at 104 Pa and the temperature of
25 °C during the filtration. Aqueous PAH solutions (400 and 600
μg/L) or metal solutions (10 and 50 mg/L) were used in the experiments.
The filtered solutions were collected into beakers. The experiments
were carried out in triplicate, and the mean values were reported
with standard deviations. Here, flux (F) and water
permeability (Pw) values were also calculated
for the poly-CD nanofibers. The F and Pw values of the membranes were calculated using eqs 5 and 6, respectively. 5   6  where V is the volume of the permeate
used, A is the active membrane area, Δt is the time of permeate collection, and P0 denotes the applied pressure. The morphology of the
nanofibers in the membrane was explored by SEM after the filtration
tests.
