Efficient design of electromagnetic
(EM) shielding materials has
emerged as a challenging research area in the past decade. To address
this issue, we propose thin, lightweight, yet strong epoxy/carbon
fiber (CF) composites modified with functionalized graphene oxide
(GO) sheets as “interconnects”. This strategy resulted
in an impressive 175% improvement in the storage modulus, a 100% enhancement
in the lap shear strength, and an extraordinary 200% improvement in
the shielding effectiveness at a very low GO content (0.5 wt %). First,
GO was functionalized with an epoxy prepolymer (namely E-f-GO) to
improve the interfacial adhesion with the matrix polymer, epoxy. As
a control, epoxy nanocomposites were also prepared with modified GO.
It was followed by the fabrication of CF laminates impregnated with
epoxy nanocomposites. Covalent functionalization of epoxy chains on
GO sheets was confirmed using various techniques like X-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Epoxy nanocomposites
were analyzed for thermal, mechanical, electrical, and adhesive strength
behavior. CF laminates with epoxy nanocomposites were fabricated using
vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. The E-f-GO/epoxy/CF composite
exhibited an excellent shielding effectiveness value of −70
dB, and the storage modulus was found to be >40 GPa. The modified
composite showed absorption-driven shielding of EM waves and hence
can be used as a highly effective EM absorber.

1 Introduction
Lightweight materials
have become an inevitable requirement for
aerospace applications in the form of fuselage, wings, satellite payload,
rockets, and so forth. In this class of materials, epoxy/carbon fiber
(CF) composites are one of the most preferred materials because of
their excellent strength-to-weight ratio, mechanical, thermal and
electrical behavior, ease of fabrication, and design. These advantages
of epoxy/CF composites can be translated to various high-performance
applications. Currently, major components of fighter aircrafts and
commercial planes such as fuselage, wings, and so forth consist of
CF-reinforced polymers (CFRPs). In addition, they are often used in
avionics system, electronics packaging material, optical fiber guidelines,
structural applications, robotics, payloads, and so forth and more
recently, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding application
as well.1−6

Briefly, EMI can be explained as the undesired disturbances/performance
caused in a device because of the interference of multiple signals
coming from surrounding devices. In some cases, it becomes extremely
vital to protect devices from such interference to avert any damage
to critical electronic component(s). For example, the navigation system
of aircrafts, submarines, and rockets need highly efficient EMI shielding
materials. Earlier, metals were used to screen devices from electromagnetic
(EM) waves, but in the last decade, researchers have switched to polymer
composite-based shielding materials. Polymers have several advantages
over metals such as low density, corrosion resistance, ease of processing
and molding, and so forth.7−11 From the theory of EMI shielding mechanism, we understand that EM
waves can be attenuated by three mechanisms, that is, reflection,
absorption, and multiple reflections. For an effective EMI shielding
behavior, a material should have either charge carriers or magnetic
or electric dipoles to attenuate EM waves.12−15 Most of the polymers are electrically
insulating in nature and do not contain magnetic dipoles; hence, they
are transparent to EM waves. Polymers embedded with conducting or
magnetic particles can thus be explored for this particular application.
Hence, polymer composites can be easily designed to achieve the desired
property to counter the issue of EMI.16−18 Epoxy composites have
shown promising results to develop prospective and efficient materials.
Huang et al.19 obtained 20–30 dB
of shielding effectiveness (SE) for 15 wt % multiwalled nanotube/epoxy
composites. Liang and co-workers investigated graphene/epoxy composites
with 15 wt % of filler loading, and EMI SE was observed to be 21 dB
in the X-band frequency.20 Apart from electric
and magnetic properties, EMI SE of a material also depends on its
thickness. There have been several studies which suggest that the
shielding efficiency of polymer composites increases with sample thickness.21,22

Epoxy composites have been used in various applications where
high
mechanical performance is required. However, still efforts are being
made to improve the interface between the filler and matrix.23−26 It is of great importance to understand the interfacial behavior
for aerospace and automotive industry to achieve high strength, high
thermal stability, enhanced service life, and ease of manufacturing.27−29 Currently epoxy/CF composites constitute a major portion of aircraft
and automobiles. However, there have been incidents in the near past,
which emphasize to tailor the interface to achieve better EMI shielding
performance.

In the present work, we have attempted to develop
epoxy composites
consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and CF. The objective was to obtain
a better interface between the CF and epoxy matrix and hence to translate
it into an enhanced mechanical, thermal, EMI shielding behavior. In
one of the study, epoxy chains were grafted on a multiwalled carbon
nanotube (MWCNT) surface to obtain better dispersion and improved
interfacial interactions. Further, epoxy-grafted MWCNT-based composites
were prepared, and the effect of surface functionalization on complex
permittivity was studied in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz.30 Kuzhir et al.31 studied
epoxy composites filled with carbon nanotubes and carbon black for
mechanical, thermal, and microwave behavior. In this work, the EMI
shielding properties were studied on different epoxy/CF laminates
to systematically assess the shielding mechanism as the laminates
interact with the incoming EM waves. Our work was mainly focussed
on the synergistic behavior of functional GO on the mechanical, thermal,
and electromagnetic behavior in the frequency range of 12–18
GHz. First, GO was chemically functionalized with an epoxy prepolymer
in the presence of a catalyst to tailor the interaction between epoxy
and GO.32,33 Epoxy prepolymer was selected because of
its similar molecular architecture as that of the host matrix. Further,
epoxy nanocomposites were prepared with a very low concentration of
functionalized GO (0.5 wt %). The modified epoxy nanocomposite was
impregnated into a woven CF mat. Epoxy-functionalized GO (E-f-GO)
was thoroughly characterized to confirm the chemical reduction of
GO using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Epoxy nanocomposites were prepared with 0.5 wt % of GO and an equivalent
amount of E-f-GO using solution method. These nanocomposites were
studied to analyze their mechanical, thermal, adhesion, microstructure,
and electrical response. After understanding the effect of functionalization
of GO on the epoxy matrix, we fabricated CF laminates with epoxy nanocomposites
as the matrix. CF laminates were prepared using vacuum-assisted resin
transfer molding (VARTM). Further mechanical, electrical, and EMI
shielding studies were carried out for E-f-GO/E/CF laminates.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The
epoxy resin (bisphenol-F-epichlorohydrin
EPOLAM 8052) and amine-based hardener (2,2′-dimethyl-4,4′-methylene
bis(cyclohexylamine)) were kindly provided by Axson Technologies,
France. GO was prepared using Hummers method. A polyacrylonitrile-based
bidirectional woven CF (HCP200A) was procured from Hindoostan Technical
Fabrics Limited having a density of 1.8 g/cm3, with a filament
diameter of 7 μm, and an areal weight of fabric 200 gsm. Triphenylphosphine
(TPP), catalyst, was commercially obtained. All solvents and reagents
used were commercially procured and used without any further purification.

2.2 Synthesis of Epoxy-f-GO
E-f-GO was
synthesized using covalent functionalization of GO sheets. The epoxy
prepolymer (500 mg) and GO (100 mg) were well-dispersed in dimethylformamide
separately using bath sonication. Both solutions were mixed together
and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Further, TPP was added to
this reaction mixture as a catalyst, and the reaction was carried
out at 100 °C for 24 h. Functionalized GO was washed with acetone
thoroughly using the dispersion–filtration–washing method,
and finally, E-f-GO was obtained and dried at 150 °C (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Epoxy-f-GO
2.3 Preparation
of Epoxy Nanocomposites
Epoxy nanocomposites were prepared
using solution mixing technique.34 The
concentration of GO was fixed at 0.5 wt
%. The required amount of GO and E-f-GO was dispersed in ethanol using
bath sonication for 30 min. The epoxy resin was then added and sonicated
for another 30 min. The mixture was kept under vacuum at 60 °C
to evaporate the solvent. After solvent removal, it was mixed using
a mechanical mixer with simultaneous sonication maintaining the bath
temperature at 50 °C for 2 h at 400 rpm. The hardener was then
added and mixed for 10 min at 500 rpm. Bubbles were removed by keeping
the mixture in vacuum for 1 h. Then, the mixture was poured into a
preheated Teflon-coated mold and cured at 60, 80, 100, and 120 °C
for 30 min each cycle. This curing cycle was adopted to avoid void
formation, which can be detrimental to composite properties.

2.4 Fabrication of CF Laminates
CF laminates
were prepared using the VARTM technique, as shown in the Scheme 2. The CF mat was
aligned at 0° and later the epoxy resin was infused in the CF
mat. For laminate fabrication, CF-to-resin ratio was 50:50, which
is commercially used for most of the applications. Laminates were
cured in oven under same conditions as epoxy nanocomposites and post
cured at 140 °C. Table 1 gives the details of samples and sample denotations used
in this work.

2.5 Characterization
The effective grafting
of the epoxy polymer on GO was confirmed using a PerkinElmer FTIR
spectrometer. The percentage grafting of synthesized particles and
thermal decomposition of the composites were monitored by a Netzsch
STA 409 PC thermogravimetric analyzer at a rate of 10 °C/min
in air. AFM was performed, and the variation in the thickness of GO
sheets was observed using JPK Nanowizard AFM. TEM images were obtained
using Tecnai G2 F30 at 300 kV. Raman spectra were obtained for different
functionalized GO powder using a LabRAM HR (UV) system with 532 nm
laser excitation. XRD patterns of GO and E-f-GO were collected using
an XpertPro, PANalytical instrument in the range of 8°–40°
2θ. The mechanical behavior was studied using a Q800 dynamic
mechanical analyzer from TA Instruments. Thermal analysis was done
using a Q2000 modulated differential scanning calorimeter. The samples
were heated at a rate of 2 °C/min with a modulation of 1 °C
from −30 to 160 °C. The microstructure of various samples
was obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Lap shear test
was carried out at 0.5 mm/min under tensile loading to measure the
adhesion strength of epoxy nanocomposites. Electrical conductivity
for epoxy nanocomposites was measured using a Novocontrol Alpha-N
impedance analyzer in a broad frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz, whereas for CF laminates, electrical conductivity was
measured using four-probe method on an Agilent DC probe station. EMI
SE was measured using the waveguide setup on sheet samples of thickness
0.4 mm in the frequency range of 12.4–18 GHz.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of E-f-GO
FTIR spectra for functionalized GO (Figure 1a) confirm the successful synthesis
of E-f-GO.
For the synthesis of E-f-GO, the carboxylic and hydroxyl functional
groups on the GO surface facilitate the epoxide ring-opening reaction.
The emergence of new peaks at 1710, 1650, 1580, and 1495 cm–1 confirms the presence of C=O stretching, C=C stretching,
C=C bending, and C–C stretching (in the ring) and C–H
bending, respectively. This further confirms the covalent functionalization
of epoxy chains on to GO sheets.

XRD pattern for GO and E-f-GO;
(c) Raman spectra for GO and E-f-GO; (d) TGA profiles for the epoxy
prepolymer, GO, and E-f-GO; (e) AFM scan and the corresponding height
profile of GO; (f) AFM scan and the corresponding height profile of
E-f-GO; and (g) dispersion state of GO (vial 1) and E-f-GO (vial 2)
in ethanol.

Figure 1b shows
the XRD patterns for GO and E-f-GO. The peak at 9.5° indicates
the diffraction peak for GO sheets. This characteristic peak of GO
completely disappeared upon covalent functionalization with epoxy
chains. The broadening and peak shift in E-f-GO and a new peak around
21° further suggest the partial reduction of GO and short-range
restacking upon functionalization of GO.

From Raman spectra
shown in Figure 1c,
D- and G-band intensity ratio of GO was altered
on functionalization with epoxy chains. For both samples, two sharp
peaks were observed at 1356 (D-band) and 1603 cm–1 (G-band). The ID/IG ratio for GO and E-f-GO was observed to be 1.23 and 1.46,
respectively. Hence, degree of defects increased in GO sheets upon
covalent functionalization. From intensity ratios of E-f-GO, it reflects
that epoxy polymer chains created more disorder on GO sheets. It also
confirms that epoxy chains have been attached to various reactive
sites on GO and epoxy chains cross-linked two or more GO sheets.

The thermal decomposition behavior of GO, epoxy resin, and E-f-GO
was studied (Figure 1d) to quantify the amount of the epoxy prepolymer on the GO sheets.
The weight loss around 100 °C in GO is due to the evaporation
of water. The labile oxygen functionalities like −COOH and
−OH undergo pyrolysis at 200 °C and showed a 14% weight
loss. The pyrolysis of carbon skeleton and more stable oxygen functionalities
occurred at 450 °C. For E-f-GO, the initial dip corresponds to
the removal of water molecules, and degradation of epoxy started 350
°C onward. There was no major degradation at 200 °C, which
suggests a partial reduction of GO functional groups. The residual
weight percentage of epoxy, E-f-GO, and GO are 9.28, 7, and 3.42%,
respectively.

AFM micrographs obtained for GO and E-f-GO show
variation in the
sheet thickness (Figure 1e,f). Upon functionalization of GO, a thin layer of epoxy chains
was observed and the morphology of GO has been altered. From the height
image, it was observed that there is an increase in sheet thickness,
which again confirms the presence of polymer chains on GO. The dispersion
state of GO (vial A) and E-f-GO (vial B) in ethanol was monitored
(Figure 1g). GO dispersion
appeared brownish, whereas the E-f-GO solution appeared black, which
also suggests the reduction of GO sheets.

3.2 Analysis
of Epoxy Nanocomposites
3.2.1 Microstructure of Various
Epoxy/GO Nanocomposites
Figure 2a–c
shows the morphology of cryofractured epoxy nanocomposites. Figure 2a is the morphology
of neat epoxy, which does not show any void formation. Hence, we can
suggest that the processing conditions adopted for curing resulted
in a defect-free surface. With the inclusion of different fillers,
GO, and E-f-GO, the morphology of epoxy was altered (Figure 2b,c). GO sheets have various
functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxide groups.
Because of the presence of these functional groups, GO disperses well
in the epoxy matrix. It is evident from SEM micrographs that the surface
roughness was more in GO/epoxy compared to that in E-f-GO/epoxy. From
this, we conclude that functionalization of the GO surface with the
epoxy prepolymer enhanced in improving the dispersion state of GO.
Because the weight fraction of GO is very low, that is, 0.5 wt %,
we did not observe any prominent agglomeration. The well-dispersed
E-g-GO alters the behavior of the epoxy matrix, which can further
translate into enhanced macroscale properties.

(c) 0.5 wt % E-f-GO (20 000× magnification).

3.2.2 Dynamic Mechanical Response
and Adhesion
Behavior
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out
to understand the effect of functionalization of GO on the mechanical
response of epoxy nanocomposites. DMA is an effective and sensitive
tool to study the interfacial region and can provide quantitative
analysis of the contribution of functionalized GO to improve the mechanical
behavior of composites. For DMA analysis, experiments were carried
out using a three-point bending clamp in the temperature range of
30–160 °C at the rate of 5°/min, 10 Hz frequency,
and 5 μm amplitude. Figure 3 shows storage modulus as the function of temperature
for various epoxy nanocomposites. For neat epoxy, the storage modulus
was lower than the filled system, whereas GO- and E-f-GO-filled epoxy
nanocomposites showed higher storage moduli. It is known that storage
modulus represents the material ability to store energy, in other
words, the elastic response of the material under given deformation
conditions. Hence, it is clear from the graph that E-f-GO improves
the interface between epoxy and GO and provides resistance to the
deformation caused during mechanical loading. The E-f-GO/epoxy nanocomposite
showed an approx. 28% increment in storage modulus relative to neat
epoxy.

Figure 3 Storage modulus as a function of temperature for various epoxy
nanocomposites.

The lap shear strength
of epoxy nanocomposites was studied under
tensile load using ASTM 1002. A CFRP was used as the adherent. Figure 4 represents the load
carried by the adhesive as a function of applied strain. Neat epoxy
failed at the load of 3000 N, and the GO/epoxy nanocomposite could
bear loads up to 4110 N. Unlike them, the E-f-GO/epoxy-based adhesive
was able to withstand loads up to 5600 N. Hence, there was a 100%
improvement in the lap shear strength of the E-f-GO/epoxy composite.
It can be attributed to the strong interaction between the adhesive
and adherent (Table 2). As discussed, SEM micrographs also showed well-dispersed modified
GO in the host matrix. This also suggests that E-f-GO/epoxy can improve
wettability with the CF surface.

3.2.3 Thermal Behavior and the Extent of Cross-linking
For thermoset polymers, such as epoxy, it is difficult to observe
any transition using conventional differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) because of the cross-linked structure. Hence, for our analysis,
we carried out an experiment using modulated DSC (MDSC), which gives
information of both reversible and nonreversible Cp values. The reversible Cp tells about the glass-transition temperature of epoxy. Figure 5 shows reversible Cp as a function of temperature for different
epoxy systems, and Tg is tabulated in Table 3. The experiment was
carried out in the temperature range of 0–170 °C, ramp
rate 5 °C/min, and signals were modulated at ±1 °C
for every 60 s under a nitrogen condition. From the result, it is
clear that the presence of GO lowers the Tg of the epoxy polymer, which is attributed to the reduction of effective
cross-link volume, whereas the E-f-GO/epoxy nanocomposite showed a
slight increase in the Tg value. From
this, we can conclude that epoxy functionalization of GO sheets can
alter the molecular motion of epoxy chains and affect the extent of
cross-linking to a minimum extent, thereby improving the state of
dispersion of GO in host epoxy.

3.2.4 Charge Transport in Various Epoxy Nanocomposites
Figure 6 shows the
electrical conductivity of epoxy nanocomposites as a function of frequency.
Epoxy polymer is an electrical insulator, and because of the presence
of −OH, −COOH, and C–O–C groups on the
GO surface, it does not allow the movement of electric charge, unlike
graphene which is a highly conductive material. Hence, GO/epoxy showed
a completely insulating behavior. We know that reduced GO can enhance
the electrical behavior of GO because of the less defective site.
However, in our work, because GO reduction was carried out with epoxy
chains, which is again insulating, the electrical behavior of E-f-GO/epoxy
did not alter. This type of nanocomposites having a high adhesive
strength and high electrical resistance can be used in electronic
packaging industry.

various
epoxy nanocomposites.

3.3 Analysis of CF Laminates
From the
above discussion, we can understand how E-f-GO affects various properties
of the epoxy matrix. After thorough analysis of epoxy nanocomposites,
we fabricated thin laminates with two layers of bidirectional woven
CF mat and modified epoxy. Further, we studied mechanical and EMI
shielding behavior of these laminates.

3.3.1 Morphology
and the Interfacial Adhesion
with the Host Matrix
Figure 7 shows the microstructure of different CF composites
with epoxy (a), GO/epoxy (b), and E-f-GO/epoxy (c). From the SEM micrograph
of Ep/CF, it is observed that there is nonuniform distribution of
epoxy and improper adhesion with the fiber (see inset of Figure 7). This can lead
to inferior properties of laminates and can cause severe damage during
their service life. This issue can be dealt by improving the interface
between the matrix and fiber. SEM micrographs of GO/Ep/CF also showed
some delamination, however, to a lesser extent. In this case, few-layered
stacks of GO driven by the strong van der Waal’s forces can
impede their uniform dispersion in the host epoxy. Interestingly,
E-f-GO/Ep/CF showed better adhesion of epoxy with the fiber surface.
This can be attributed to the interaction between the surface functional
group available on CF and modified GO sheets. It is envisaged that
upon grafting epoxy chains onto GO, the sheets are well-exfoliated
(as supported by XRD), resulting in their uniform dispersion. Moreover,
in the case of E-f-GO, the presence of short epoxy chains ensures
better interfacial adhesion with the host epoxy and the CF facilitated
by E-g-GO “interconnects” (see inset of Figure 7). These observations can be
well-correlated with the observed SEM images of the fractured laminates
where lesser debonding can be seen from Figure 7c. These “interconnects” besides
improving the structural properties (discussed in the next section)
can also help in better charge transport at the interface (will be
discussed in the following sections dealing with EMI shielding properties).

to each micrograph represent the nature of interactions between CF
and epoxy in each case. The dark solid circles indicate the cross-sectional
view of CF, thick solid curved lines indicate epoxy chains, dark wrinkled
features indicate GO, and thin curved lines indicate epoxy chains
grafted onto GO).

3.3.2 Dynamic
Mechanical Response
The
improvement in the matrix–fiber interface can be translated
into an enhanced mechanical behavior. Figure 8 shows the storage modulus of different CF
laminates as a function of temperature, and Figure 9 shows tan δ as a function of temperature
to evaluate the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the laminates. DMA analysis becomes very critical in
specific applications such as in aircrafts and missiles where the
thermomechanical response determines the performance. All experiments
were carried out in the linear viscoelastic region. For the Ep/CF
composite, the storage modulus is approx. 17 GPa and Tg is 117 °C, whereas GO/Ep/CF showed a slight improvement
in the storage modulus. Further, we observed that E-f-GO/Ep/CF exhibited
a high modulus value of 47 GPa, which suggests that there is a formation
of strong interfacial bonding between the fiber and matrix. In other
words, inclusion of E-g-GO in Ep/CF composites acted as “interconnects”,
thereby improving the stress transfer at the interface. Hence, it
can be concluded that E-f-GO/Ep/CF laminates can withstand mechanical
deformation in a wide temperature range. From tan δ plot as
well, it is clear that molecular movement of the composite was restricted
with the infusion of E-f-GO/epoxy into the CF mat. The broadness in
tan δ curve also indicates that there is a long-range relaxation
in the composite.

3.3.3 Charge Transport and
the Microwave Absorption
Behavior
It is important to understand the electrical response
of the composite, if we are considering EMI shielding application.
Sheet resistance was measured using van der Paw method and later electrical
conductivity of composites was calculated accordingly. Table 4 summarizes the calculated electrical
conductivity of different CF laminates. It is evident that upon grafting
GO with epoxy chains, the sheet resistance has increased as E-f-GO
is localized as “interconnects” between host epoxy and
CF. This observation is important from shielding EM radiation. If
the skin is conducting, one may expect surface reflection, and if
the skin offers more resistance, the incoming EM radiation can penetrate
and interact with the entities in the shield.

Figure 10 represents
SEtotal as a function of frequency for CF laminates. SEtotal was measured for different material under test (MUT)
in the frequency range of 12–18 GHz using the waveguide setup
(Scheme 3). It was
observed that the electrical conductivity of Ep/CF composites did
not alter significantly with the inclusion of GO and E-g-GO-filled
epoxy. However, nanoparticles introduce heterogeneity in the CF composite,
such a junction can also assist in enhancing SE. These junctions provide
multiscale interfaces in conventional Ep/CF and might assist in improving
the absorption of incident EM waves. In theory, for EMI shielding
application, high electrical conductivity of material is not a necessary
condition to attenuate EM wave energy. In our study, we found that
the E-f-GO/Ep/CF composite can shield the equipment upto −68
dB, which means >99% of the incident wave is being shielded. In
contrast,
Ep/CF and GO/Ep/CF composites showed SE of −22 and −50
dB, respectively (Figure 10). Metals are a homogeneous system having high electrical
conductivity, causing shielding mainly through reflection and slightly
through the absorption mechanism in which the energy of EM waves are
exponentially reduced up to skin depth. Unlike metals, CF composites
are not perfect conductors; hence, the reflection mechanism is not
the only governing factor for shielding. CF laminates are dielectric
lossy materials, which contribute to the absorption of EM waves. The
formation of a heterogeneous junction between the nanofiller (GO and
E-f-GO) and CF can deteriorate the wave energy, thus causing high
SE. Further, % attenuation was calculated from T + A + R = 1, where T is
transmission, R is reflectance, and A is absorption (see Figure 10d).31 It was observed that Ep-f-GO/Ep/CF
attenuated 99.999% of incident waves (>90% absorption) compared
to
98% attenuation (70% absorption) showed by Ep/CF. This begins to suggest
that thin sheets of E-f-GO/Ep/CF can replace conventional EMI shielding
materials often used in the aircraft. This can further improve the
aircraft efficiency without comprising its critical requirement of
EMI shielding. 1   2   3

(d) % absorption of epoxy composites at 18 GHz.

Scheme 3 Experimental Setup for EMI Shielding Measurement
From the results presented
in Figure 10, it is
clear that absorption is the main
mechanism involved in the attenuation of incident electromagnetic
radiation facilitated by the multiple reflection through epoxy-functionalized
GO “interconnects”. SER and SEA were measured using scattering parameters, S21 and S11 (eqs 2 and 3). SER depends on the surface charge mobility of MUT, and from electrical
conductivity results, we know that surface conductivity did not alter
significantly with the inclusion of nanoparticles. Hence, SER for all CF composites was below −10 dB, whereas SEA altered significantly in the presence of GO and E-f-GO, creating
heterogeneity in the CF composites. For E-f-GO/Ep/CF composites, SEA > −50 dB was observed in the frequency range of
12–18
GHz. It is envisaged that CF act as a wave guide and eventually absorbs
the incident EM radiation through multiple scattering within the fabric.
In our study, as epoxy-functionalized GO is well-exfoliated in the
host matrix, it acts as “interconnects”, thereby promoting
multiple internal reflections through materials that show varied impedance
(a cartoon illustrating this phenomenon is pictorially depicted in Scheme 4). This impedance
mismatch results in the attenuation of the incoming EM radiation and
manifests as absorption in the measured scattering parameters in a
network analyzer. The increased sheet resistance further promotes
the incoming EM radiation to penetrate into the shield and interact
with the entities. As observed earlier that the sheet resistance is
higher in the case of E-f-GO/Ep/CF laminates, higher absorption in
this case can be expected. The rapid decay in the energy of EM waves
is due to absorption phenomena eventually resulting in the conversion
of the EM energy to thermal energy. This mechanism can cause an increase
in the temperature of MUT (CF composites) when exposed to an EM environment.
From literature it is well-known that CF and GO are excellent thermal
conductors. We carried out an experiment to understand the thermal
response shown by this microwave-absorbing material under exposure
to EM waves. For this purpose, 1-port VNA was used and an EM wave
was incident on samples using a waveguide (Scheme 5). CF composite samples were exposed to the
EM radiation at a maximum frequency of 18 GHz and power level of 13
dBm for 10 min, and The thermal response was captured using a Fluke
IR thermal imaging scanner. It was observed that there was no significant
change in the temperature level for any of the laminates at a maximum
frequency of 18 GHz (Figure 11). In addition, we assessed the thermal degradation of these
laminates (not shown here). CF laminates degrade in two stages; first,
epoxy three-dimensional network undergoes degradation at 350 °C,
followed by CF degradation. Hence, it can be concluded that these
materials can be used as an excellent microwave absorber with good
thermal stability.

by Multiple Reflections between GO Sheets Functionalized with Epoxy
in Epoxy/CF Laminates
CF act as a waveguide
and the
functionalized GO sheets act as “interconnects” to yield
multiple reflections eventually resulting in the attenuation of the
incoming EM radiation

4 Conclusions
In the
present work, we have attempted to understand the influence
of an interface on the mechanical and EM absorption behavior of epoxy/CF
composites. Covalent functionalization of GO sheets with epoxy chains
was carried out, and a thorough characterization was done to confirm
the chemical reduction of GO. Epoxy nanocomposites incorporated with
0.5 wt % of GO and E-f-GO were prepared using solution technique.
Various thermal, mechanical, and electrical analyses were employed
to study the influence of E-f-GO on the epoxy matrix. Further, laminates
were fabricated with two layers of a woven CF mat and a modified epoxy
nanocomposite was infused. On incorporating E-g-GO in epoxy/CF laminates,
an impressive 175% improvement in the storage modulus, 100% enhancement
in the lap shear strength, and an extraordinary 200% improvement in
the SE at a very low filler content (0.5 wt %) were observed. Such
a lightweight, thin yet strong EM absorbing material can be a good
alternative for the existing metal-based shields.
