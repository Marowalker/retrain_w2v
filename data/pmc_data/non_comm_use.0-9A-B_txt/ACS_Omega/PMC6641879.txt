Introduction
The 1,4-benzodiazepine
scaffold is a well-established “privileged
scaffold” in medicinal chemistry,1−16 and we have an active interest in synthesizing libraries of such
compounds.17−21 Our recently described triazolo-benzodiazepine derivative TC AC 28 is a potent, selective bromo and extraterminal bromodomain
inhibitor and a useful epigenetic tool compound, with a crystallographically
defined binding mode to the target protein and displaying Kd values of 40 and 800 nM toward Brd2(2) and
Brd2(1), respectively.22,23 We sought to scale up the original
seven-step-protocol toward the racemic product (as in the original
manuscript) with the aim of improving the final two problematic and
low-yielding steps.23

Results and Discussion
Our scale-up efforts (step 1, Scheme 1) started with a synthesis of the methyl
ester hydrochloride salt 2, which was formed in virtually
quantitative yield, followed by a cyclization step (step 2) to afford
the isatoic anhydride 4.24

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Triazolo-Benzodiazepinone, 7
Reaction of the latter formed
the benzodiazepinedione 5, and we employed an ether trituration,
as opposed to our earlier
reported chromatographic purification workup. This was followed by
treatment with Lawesson’s reagent25,26 and then mercury-mediated cyclization to afford the triazolo-analogue 7 (steps 3–5). At this stage, no significant differences
in yields were noticed from our original report and we did not attempt
less toxic routes to 7 given that the yield was acceptable
and the chemistry scalable. However, the next two crucial steps were
vital in our aims to obtain approximate gram quantities of product.

Step 6 (Scheme 2)
was originally performed by combining 12 batches of ca. 170 mg of
precursor 7, producing the key chloroimidate intermediate 8, which was obtained as a white solid in 29% yield (619 mg).
Careful reexamination of this step led us to significantly lower the
amounts of POCl3 used, and we were able to avoid the inefficient
chromatographic step by carrying out a trituration in Et2O (Table 1, entry
3). Indeed, we were delighted to obtain a yield of 76% of 8 in near-gram quantities (0.80 g) in a one-step protocol.

Buoyed by this result, we next examined the final Pd-catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction to install the indolyl group
in 9.27,28 Maintaining the original Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst, we obtained, by using a 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME)/water mixture with Na2CO3 as base, 9 in 49% yield (Table 3, entry 2), which was scalable to 0.8 g of product (Table 2).

Conclusions
Overall, acceptable,
near-gram quantities of the final product 9 have been
synthesized, benefitting ultimately from improved
steps 6 and 7 of the original synthetic
route (Table 3).

Experimental
Section
All commercially purchased materials and solvents
were used without
further purification unless specified otherwise. NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 400 MHz spectrometer and prepared
in deuterated solvents, such as CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-d6. Liquid chromatography mass
spectra (LCMS) were acquired using an Agilent 6120 (600 bar) HPLC
with Agilent 1290 MCT column compartment oven and Agilent 6120 Quad
Mass spectrometer, and percentage purities were run on a Zorbax SB
C18 2.1 × 50 mm2 1.8 μm column (0.1% aq formic
acid, 0.1% formic acid in MeCN 5–95%, 0.1% trifluoroacetyl
(TFA)/MeCN, over 5 min, held at 100% for 2 min; flow rate, 0.5 mL/min)
with UV detector at 250 nm and bandwidth 100 nm. Purifications were
performed by flash chromatography on silica gel columns using a Reveleris
PREP purification system.

To a suspension of dl-aspartic acid (50.00
g, 375.65 mmol) in methanol (300 mL) at 0 °C, thionyl chloride
(68.50 mL, 939.14 mmol, 2.5 equiv) was dropwise added at such a rate
that the temperature was maintained below 10 °C. Upon completion
of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 2
h and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature and stirred overnight.
The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and
the resulting viscous oil was triturated from diethyl ether, filtered,
and dried at 40 °C under vacuum, affording the product as a white
solid (74.00 g, >99%). The spectral data were consistent with those
reported.29

(THF) (500 mL) at 0 °C, triphosgene (29.45 g, 99.23 mmol, 1 equiv)
was portionwise added at such a rate that the temperature was maintained
below 5 °C. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture
was stirred for 18 h at ambient temperature. The reaction was recooled
to 0 °C, and H2O (15 mL) was added in a dropwise fashion
at such a rate that the temperature was maintained below 10 °C.
After stirring for a further 30 min at ambient temperature, the reaction
mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was triturated
with H2O, and the resulting solid was collected by filtration
and dried at 50 °C under vacuum, affording the product as a brown
solid (17.00 g, 89%). LCMS purity (UV): 99%, tR 3.24 min. The NMR data were consistent with those reported.23

g, 232.97
mmol) and dl-aspartic acid dimethyl ester hydrochloride (46.04
g, 232.99 mmol, 1 equiv) were suspended in pyridine (600 mL), and
the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 18 h. After cooling
to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated under
reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate
(500 mL) and 2 M HCl (500 mL). The organic layer was separated, and
the aqueous layer was further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 ×
350 mL). Some solid material at the phase boundary was collected by
filtration, giving an initial crop of product. The combined organic
phase of the filtrate was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated
under reduced pressure. Trituration with diethyl ether afforded the
product as a white solid (27.30 g, 43%). LCMS purity (UV): 96%, tR 3.12 min. The NMR data were consistent with
those reported.23

(+/−)-Methyl-2-(7-methoxy-5-oxo-2-thioxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)acetate (6)
To a suspension of the previous compound 5 (15.01 g, 53.91 mmol) in pyridine (265 mL), Lawesson’s
reagent (19.62 g, 48.52 mmol, 0.9 equiv) was added, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at reflux for 6 h. The reaction mixture was cooled
to ambient temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
residue was suspended in CH2Cl2 (3 × 300
mL) and reconcentrated under reduced pressure. Trituration with CH2Cl2 afforded the product as a pale yellow solid
(8.30 g, 53%). LCMS purity (UV): 92%, tR 3.51 min. The NMR data were consistent with those reported.23

(+/−)-Methyl-2-(8-methoxy-1-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-benzo[f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepin-4-yl)acetate (7)

was added. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and mercury
(II) acetate (12.91 g, 40.77 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added to the reaction
mixture portionwise at such a rate that the temperature was maintained
below 5 °C. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture
was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h and then allowed to warm to ambient
temperature and stirred for 48 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated
under reduced pressure, and the residue was partitioned between NaHCO3 (sat. aq., 450 mL) and ethyl acetate (300 mL). The aqueous
component was separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 ×
300 mL). The combined organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and
concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was collected as

g, 6.26 mmol) and POCl3 (0.72 g, 4.70 mmol) were added
under inert atmosphere, and the reaction was heated at 80 °C
for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was slowly
poured into lukewarm water (80 mL) with stirring. After stirring for
15 min, it was diluted with CHCl3 (50 mL) and the layers
were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with further CHCl3 (50 mL). The combined organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was triturated
with diethyl ether to afford an off-white solid (0.80 g, 76%). The
product was used without further purification. LCMS purity (UV): 97%, tR 3.94 min. The NMR data were consistent with
those reported.23

in water (6 mL) was added, followed by the addition of indole-4-boronic
acid (0.77 g, 4.76 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.31
g, 0.27 mmol), and the reaction was heated at 85 °C for 2.5 h.
After cooling to ambient temperature, it was filtered over celite,
and the filtrate was partitioned between EtOAc/water. The layers were
separated, and the organic layer was further washed with water and
brine. The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The product was collected as a white solid
(0.81 g, 49%) after flash column chromatography (rf = 0.35; 95:5 CH2Cl2/MeOH). 1H NMR (400 MHz) CDCl3: δ = 8.40 (s, 1H), 7.52 (d, J = 8.0,
