Lignin isolated from beech sawdust was used for the preparation
of lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) with entrapped essential oil (EO) from
cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), common thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), and wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) using a fast antisolvent method. Analysis of EO-loaded LNPs
by pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed molecular interaction between
EOs and LNPs. Quantification of EO incorporation into the LNPs and
their in vitro release profiles were assessed by reversed phase high-performance
liquid chromatography. Utilized EOs were, to different extents, successfully
entrapped inside LNPs, which were attributed to extensive π-stacking
between aromatic compounds in EOs like cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and
carvacrol on one side and aromatic lignin units on the other side.
In vitro release of common thyme and wild thyme EOs from EO-loaded
LNPs was strongly delayed compared to the use of pure oil, giving
a promising outlook for the development of new bio-based biocide delivery
systems for wood preservation.

Introduction
Since mankind has started using wood for
their own needs, the problem
of its degradation has emerged limiting its use in specific outdoor
environments,1 that is, in the use classes
3 to 5 according to EN 335:2013,2 where
wood deterioration by fungi, bacteria, and insects causes significant
economic and resource loss.3,4 Thus, extending the
service life of wood and wood products has always been of huge interest
and different strategies against wood degradation have been elaborated.
Selection of naturally durable and actually underexploited wood species
could establish new wood resources for future technological applications.5−7 Further, physical treatments, that is, heat treatments, rendering
wood less susceptible to decay were applied successfully.8,9 Traditional chemical treatment agents for wood durability improvement,
for example, chromated copper arsenate, creosote, pentachlorophenol,
and inorganic arsenicals, have been utilized until today, eventually
causing environmental problems as well as affecting human health.5,10−12 Consequently, over time, environmentally friendly
solutions able to reduce or eliminate the use of classic wood preservatives
were demanded due to toxicity concerns.13 In the past decade, interest has gradually focused on naturally
occurring compounds and in particular essential oils (EOs) showed
promising results regarding prevention of wood decay. Their activity
against pathogenic microorganisms was tested in several works, and
compounds as thymol, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and carvacrol were identified
as effective biocides against wood-decaying bacteria as well as against
white-rot and brown-rot fungi.13−17 However, certain limitations for the utilization of EOs in wood
preservative formulations exist, that is, regarding their retention
inside the wood matrix or their stability toward bio- and photodegradation,
as reviewed in detail by Singh T. and Singh A. P.17

Introduction of nanoparticles (NPs) in the development
of future
wood preservatives enables utilization of biocides at low concentrations
as well as a controlled release of the entrapped biocide. Indeed,
due to their small size, NPs can successively overcome limitations
by a wood structure when smaller than window pits (10 nm) and membrane
openings in bordered pits (400–600 nm) in softwood or than
vessels (<50 μm) in hardwoods. Through encapsulation or entrapment
biocides in NPs gain prolonged activity, a lower and controlled leaching
rate and a shielding against UV-induced wood degradation extend the
service time of treated wood and wood products.18 Due to their aromatic structure, LNPs are considered a
promising carrier for biocides providing substantial protection against
sunlight-induced degradation processes and oxidation increasing stability
of biocides.19 Lignin’s natural
chemical heterogeneity, as shown, that is, for chestnut lignin from
different Italian regions by pyrolysis-GCMS,20 might be an obstacle for its use as a carrier matrix in biocide
delivery systems (BDSs). However, several literature reports in the
past years prove the compatibility of lignin as a matrix for controlled
release of biocides or drugs, as recently reviewed in detail.21,22

In our recent work, LNPs were prepared via an environment-friendly
dialysis method using DMSO as a lignin solvent and successively applied
on wood surfaces where LNPs showed a tendency to create film-like
structures on the woody substrate under UV radiation.23 With the vision of active lignin coatings for wood protection
applications, this work’s aim was to prepare and test a novel
BDS consisting of LNPs and entrapped essential oils from cinnamon
bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume),
common thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.),
and wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.).
Release behavior of the entrapped essential oils was studied by a
dialysis method in water, designed as an extreme case of wet outdoor
conditions where novel active lignin coatings could be applied.

Results and Discussion
Qualitative Analysis of the Loaded EO-LNPs by Py-GCMS
Py-GCMS of the prepared freeze-dried EO-LNPs was applied to obtain
a complete picture of their components when analyzing the whole sample
at once: in the respective pyrograms, beside the common lignin pyrolysis
products, also the main components of the used EOs were detected (Figure 1, bold colored letters). The peaks of the
main EO components were rather intense, and thus, the respective calculated
relative peak areas were of considerable extent (Table 1). In EO-LNPs CB, in total 10
particular peaks were found beside the regular lignin pyrolysis products
detected for pure LNPs (LNPs solo) and identified as components of
cinnamon bark EO. However, the two peaks 12 (cinnamic acid) and 15
(2-methoxycinnamaldehyde) were considered to be formed during pyrolysis,
since the two substances were not listed in the GC profile of EO from
CB (Table 6). In the
case of EO-LNPs CT, beside the main peak thymol (B), also carvacrol
(C), borneol (I), linalool (H), caryophyllene (G), p-cymene (D), and γ-terpinene (E) were detected. In the case
of EO-LNPs WT, additionally to the main peak carvacrol, also thymol,
linalool, caryophyllene, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene
were found.

As mentioned above, after preparation by dialysis,
aliquots of
the different EO-LNP dispersions were freeze-dried and subsequently
analyzed by Py-GCMS. The presence of EO components in the pyrograms
of freeze-dried EO-LNPs indicated substantial association of certain
components of the EOs with lignin during preparation as well as substantial
retention of the volatile oils by their LNP carriers during freeze-drying,
since unbound EOs were expected to get removed during freeze-drying.
However, EOs attached on the surface of the LNPs could not be distinguished
from EOs incorporated into the LNP molecular structure by the used
Py-GCMS method. The question regarding the specific way of interaction
between EOs and lignin molecules, for example, external adhesion or
entrapment via internal incorporation, was further investigated by
in vitro release studies using EO-LNP dispersions as well as redispersed
freeze-dried EO-LNPs and confronting their release profiles with those
obtained for pure EO aqueous dispersions.

Qualitative Analysis of Loaded EO-LNPs by FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of freeze-dried EO-LNPs showed significant differences
compared to the respective control sample of unloaded LNPs. Comparison
with FTIR spectra of the respective pure EOs revealed overlapping
bands (double arrows and green wavenumbers in Figure 2). Considering the workup process of freeze-drying
where unbound EOs are expected to get removed, as mentioned above,
the overlapping bands could indicate an intimate association between
EOs and LNPs. In the case of EO-LNPs CB, two strong bands at 1720
and 1680 cm–1 were noted, which were attributed
to the carbonyl C=O bond in cinnamaldehyde, the main component
of EO from CB (Table 6). Other bands in the FTIR spectrum of pure EO-CB manifested as shoulder
peaks in the spectrum of EO-LNPs CB at 1622, 1505, and 1463 cm–1, which were assigned to additional aromatic skeleton
vibrations, C=O stretching modes, and aromatic C–H stretching
modes, respectively, deriving from cinnamaldehyde (Table 2). The increase, relative to
LNPs solo, of the band at 1368 cm–1 in the spectrum
of EO-LNPs CB could be attributed
to additional phenolic hydroxyl groups deriving from eugenol as well
as aliphatic C–H stretching in terminal methyl groups in eugenol,
linalool, and caryophyllene. Additional G ring breathing from eugenol
and again C=O stretching modes from cinnamaldehyde were considered
to cause the respective increase of the bands at 1267 cm–1 as well as 1021 cm–1. The band at 971 cm–1 was attributed to C=C out-of-plane deformation modes deriving
from double bonds in cinnamaldehyde or linalool.

a The one letter code in the column
for the contributions of the essential oil (EO) components refers
to the compounds depicted in Figure 7.

In the case of EO-CT and EO-WT, which contain as main
components
phenolic aromatics like thymol and carvacrol, the alkylbenzene p-cymene, and the monoterpenes γ-terpinene and linalool,
all of them with different molecular structures than common lignin
monomers, several new bands beside the known lignin bands were registered.
Thus, shoulders of the bands at 1611 and 1508 cm–1 as well as increased absorbances at 1458 and 1418 cm–1 were attributed to additional aromatic skeletal vibrations deriving
from thymol and p-cymene in EO-CT. The two new bands
at 1375 and 1358 cm–1 were assigned to terminal
methyl groups in the isopropyl group in thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene (Figure 7). The bands at 1288, 1264, and 1224 cm–1, a spectral area representing G and S ring breathing
in lignin, as well as the new bands at 1149 and 1095 cm–1, in the area of aromatic C–H in-plane deformation modes,
were attributed to thymol based on confrontation with a pure thymol
ATR-FTIR spectrum.24 Correspondingly, the
band at 810 cm–1 was assigned to thymol and carvacrol
as well as p-cymene, as they represent maxima in
their respective pure substances’ FTIR spectra attributed to
aromatic C–H out-of-plane deformation modes.

The FTIR
spectrum of EO-LNPs WT displayed a similar situation as
observed for EO-LNPs CT with some differences in the area of lignin
G and S ring breathing (1300–1200 cm–1).
Further, a new band at 1177 cm–1, located in the
area of aromatic ring breathing modes and deriving from carvacrol
as supported by comparison with a pure carvacrol FTIR spectrum, and
an additional weak shoulder band at 990 cm–1, attributed
to the 1:2:4 substitution of the aromatic ring in carvacrol by Valderrama
and De Gante (Figure 2), were observed.24

DLS Analysis of Lignin Nanoparticles Loaded with Essential Oil
The different EO-LNP dispersions were analyzed by DLS after preparation
by dialysis. Average hydrodynamic diameters and polidispersity indexes
(PDIs) obtained by cumulant analysis are reported in Table 3. Intensity-weighted size distributions
obtained by CONTIN algorithm are shown in Figure 3. Cumulant analysis leads to an average diameter
of 108 nm and a very low PDI for unloaded LNPs, confirming results
of previous investigations.26 The addition
of the different EOs promoted a significant increase of the average
particle size and PDI of the resulting EO-LNP fractions, which was
attributed to the inclusion of the EO molecules into the LNP structure.
All three EO-LNP dispersions showed a monodisperse size distribution
with an average particle size varying with the used EO (Figure 3). No presence of aggregates
detected in the EO-LNP dispersions.

SEM Analysis of Lignin Nanoparticles Loaded with Essential Oil
Particle surfaces of EO-LNPs analyzed by SEM generally showed less
details and their surface appeared smoother than observed for unloaded
pure LNPs in our earlier work.26 A much
higher contrast between the particle center and shell was noted, resulting
in a “coated”-like appearance of EO-LNPs CB (Figure 4a,b). This effect
was attributed to interactions between LNPs and essential oil molecules
either superficially associated or properly incorporated into the
shell of the LNPs. During the SEM experiments on EO-LNP dispersions,
it was observed that EOs tended to heat up when taking up energy under
the SEM electron beam with the consequence of a brighter appearance
of the charged sample components. Therefore, the bright halo of the
EO-LNPs in Figure 4 was attributed to EO molecules associated with the LNP shell. Rather,
big clusters of agglomerated EO-LNPs CB in the dimension of several
micrometers were identified in the SEM micrographs (Figure 4a). In a different observation,
zone chain-like structures of single EO-LNPs CB with an average chain
length of 4–6 single nanoparticles were spotted (Figure 4b). EO molecules, only superficially
associated to the LNPs, were suspected to cause this agglomeration
phenomenon observed for EO-LNPs CB. In Figure 4c,d, less concentrated zones of the EO-LNPs
CT sample are displayed. EO-LNPS CT were of smaller size
and less agglomeration was observed compared to EO-LNPs CB. However,
the same optical effect as with EO-LNPs CB regarding their contrast
between the particle center and intensely bright particle shell was
imminent. In Figure 4e,f, redispersed freeze-dried EO-LNPs WT, as they were used for in
vitro release studies (Figure 5b, right), are shown. Since the freeze-dried powders were
only gently dispersed in water, to avoid imminent release of the entrapped
EOs through strong vortexing or sonication, agglomerates of small
EO-LNPs were observed beside single EO-LNPs. The shape of freeze-dried
EO-LNPs apparently changed compared to EO-LNPs observed in the respective
dispersions, what might have occurred during the freeze-drying procedure.

Quantification of the Loaded EOs by RP-HPLC and in Vitro Release
Studies of Loaded EOs from LNP Carriers
Figure 5a shows the fresh dispersions
prepared by dialysis, starting from a solution of lignin and EO (left)
as well as the control sample of a pure EO dispersion prepared the
same way (right). Lignin and EO contents, determined by RP-HPLC and
calculated values for their drug loading efficiencies (DLE) and drug
loading capacities (DLC), are given in Table 4. In the case of CT and WT, the loaded amount
of EOs in the respective LNP dispersions was considered more than
efficient regarding their antimicrobial activity, because much lower
concentrations in the range of 90–150 ppm were reported for
the respective IC50 values of thymol and carvacrol against
three different white-rot fungi much lower concentrations in the range
of 90–150 ppm.13 Similarly, a recent
review about EOs as antimicrobial agents cited various works that
found bactericidal concentration of EO-CB below the loadings of the
EO-LNPs CB prepared in this work.27

Based on values for DLE and DLC, the essential oil
from CB was
eventually considered as the least suitable one of the tested EOs.
The missing phenolic hydroxyl group of its main component cinnamaldehyde
compared to lignin monomeric units might have limited EO-CB’s
compatibility to interact with aromatic rings of lignin units via
π-stacking. The DLE values calculated for the respective EO-LNP
dispersions from CT and WT instead were between 60 and 70% and thus
in accordance with results presented by Dai et al. for a corresponding
ratio of lignin to active ingredient of 2:1, while DLC values on the
other hand were higher.28 However, the
question regarding the way of interaction between EOs and LNPs, that
is, superficial association versus real entrapment via structural
incorporation, needed to be investigated further since superficially
attached EO molecules were not expected to show the same release behavior
as properly entrapped EO molecules or free not entrapped EO micelles.

Thus, in vitro release studies were conducted with the original
fresh EO-LNP dispersions as well as with freeze-dried aliquots redispersed
in water (Figure 5b).
Under the used experimental conditions, where turbulences by magnetic
stirring inside the dialysis-receiving container were created, pure
EOs dispersed in water were released very fast. Already around 80%,
cumulative release (CR) was reached within the first 2 h of experiment
for EO-CT and EO-WT (Figure 6 and Table 5). The release profiles of EO-LNP dispersions in the very first phase
of the experiment resulted like the ones of pure EOs. However, later,
the shape of the curves changed toward the form of the release profiles
observed for freeze-dried EO-LNPs. This observation gave rise to the
hypothesis that the EO-LNPs CB dispersion, beside EO-LNPs, also contained
not entrapped pure EO micelles, forming parallel during the preparation
of EO-LNPs, which leached very fast in the start of the experiment.
Thus, CR after 24 h arrived at values close to the ones of pure EOs
while freeze-dried EO-LNPs instead showed significantly different
release profiles for both cases, CT and WT. In the first 2 h, CR remained
<35% and was still lower after 24 h than after 2 h for pure EOs,
indicating substantial interaction between lignin and EO molecules
in the freeze-dried samples. Only after around 48 h, CR from EO-LNPs
in both cases, CT and WT, surpassed 90% while the pure oils were almost
completely released. Instead, for freeze-dried EO-LNPs from CT and
WT, almost complete release was reached after 72 h of experiment (Table 5). In contrast, the
release profiles of EO-LNPs CB revealed much faster leaching of EO.
The time scale in the respective diagram in Figure 6 was therefore reduced to 48 h, the time
point where 100% of EO from freeze-dried EO-LNPs CB was released.
Complete CR for pure EO-CB was reached already after 24 h, when also
95% was released from the respective EO-LNPs CB dispersion. At this
point, slightly more than 90% of EO-CB was released from freeze-dried
EO-LNPs CB. Thus, molecular interaction between the main component
of EO-CB cinnamaldehyde and LNPs was assumed to be rather superficial,
and therefore, EO-CB was considered less suited as an active component
in EO-LNPs since its retention by LNPs was the lowest among the investigated
EOs, confirming the observations made above regarding DLE and DLC
values (Table 4). Nevertheless,
EO-LNPs CB significantly retarded the release of EO-CB into the surrounding
medium compared to a pure oil-in-water emulsion as illustrated in Figure 5. Further, comparing
the release profile with pure EO-CB, it was concluded that relatively
more EO micelles were formed parallel to EO-LNPs CB during the dialysis
process and subsequently contained in the respective EO-LNPs CB dispersion.
On the other side, the main components of EO-CT and EO-WT, thymol
and carvacrol, respectively, were apparently entrapped to a higher
extent inside the LNP structure and less pure EO micelles were formed
parallel during dialysis (Figure 6). In fact, when DLE and DLC values were also calculated
for freeze-dried EO-LNPs, it was evident that the respective values
presented in Table 5 for the EO-LNP dispersions needed a correction regarding the not
entrapped EO. Since the difference between DLE for the EO-LNPs WT
dispersion and the respective freeze-dried aliquot was the smallest,
it was concluded that EO entrapment worked best for WT. While DLE
for EO-LNPs CT F.D. was still acceptable, DLE for the respective sample
from CB was the lowest and the earlier stipulated hypothesis regarding
incompatibility of cinnamaldehyde for entrapment in LNPs was further
supported. Instead, the phenolic structure of thymol and carvacrol
was considered an important factor for their compatibility with lignin
enabling a higher extent of molecular interaction with lignin polyphenolic
structural elements via π-stacking, a process that was widely
reported to be the driving force for the formation of LNPs.28−32

The BDSs prepared in the actual work, characterized
by a strongly
delayed release of the entrapped biocides, present a promising way
to reduce the amounts of EOs used for biocontrol applications and
thus increasing their cost-effectiveness. Through the use of wood-processing
side streams for lignin isolation and preparation of nontoxic and
biodegradable LNPs, costs of future products can additionally be reduced
as well as environmental impacts of otherwise for energy generation
used residual biomass from wood processing.33−35 The availability
of considerable amounts of residual biomass offers chances for innovations
and the implementation of new value chains in the wood sector, especially
in areas where sawmills suffer from economic pressure to generate
revenue using side and waste streams.36−38

Conclusions
Essential oils from cinnamon bark, common
thyme, and wild thyme
were successfully entrapped into lignin nanoparticles for the preparation
of a bio-based biocide delivery system. Molecular interactions of
essential oil compounds with lignin nanoparticles were strongly indicated
based on Py-GCMS and FTIR spectroscopy. Release profiles of the essential
oils from common thyme and wild thyme entrapped in lignin nanoparticles
revealed significantly delayed leaching of the essential oils from
the carrier material caused by substantial molecular interaction between
the two partners. Essential oil from cinnamon bark instead, with the
main component cinnamaldehyde, resulted less compatible for entrapment
in lignin nanoparticles. The presented results will serve as a solid
base for the development of a promising new green biocide delivery
system based on lignin and essential oils, for example, the preservation
of wood products or foodstuffs.

Experimental Section
Materials and Chemicals
Beech wood sawdust (Fagus sylvatica L.) from the Cimini Mountains in
the Lazio region, Italy, (Piangoli Legno SNC, Soriano nel Cimino,
VT, Italy) was air-dried and then cut to 35 mesh in an IKA MF 10.1
cutting mill (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany). Milled
wood was then Soxhlet-extracted using acetone for 15 h and eventually
dried at room temperature. 1,4-Dioxane (Alfa Aesar, ACS grade 99 +
%) was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Kandel, GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany).
ACS-grade sodium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (>99.9%)
were purchased from Carlo Erba Reagents (Milan, Italy) and Sigma-Aldrich
(Milan, Italy), respectively. Pure essential oils (EOs) from cinnamon
bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume),
common thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.),
and wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.)
were purchased from FLORA Srl, Lorenzana, Italy. The main components
of the pure EOs were determined by the producer FLORA Srl, using a
PerkinElmer Clarus 500 GC-FID-MS system, and their respective contents
and structures are given in Table 6 and Figure 7, respectively.

Lignin Extraction and Preparation of Lignin Nanoparticles (LNPs)
Loaded with Essential Oils (EOs)
Acidolysis lignin (AL) from
beech wood sawdust was isolated as described elsewhere.26 Lignin nanoparticles with entrapped essential
oils (EO-LNPs) were prepared based on the protocols presented in Zikeli
et al.23,26 with the following adaptations: After dissolving
300 mg of AL in 10 mL of DMSO, 150 μL of the respective pure
EOs was added and further mixed for 5 min. After filtering through
0.45 μm CHROMAFIL Xtra syringe filters (Macherey-Nagel GmbH
& Co. KG, Düren, Germany), the solutions were filled in
dialysis bags (SpectraPor 1 Dialysis Membrane Standard RC Tubing,
6–8 kDa, Spectrum Labs, USA) and dialyzed against 4 L of distilled
water for 1 h. A short dialysis time was chosen to prevent a concomitant
release of already entrapped EOs and thus study the very first phase
of EO-LNP formation. The resulting EO-LNP dispersions were stored
in the fridge until further analysis. Aliquots of the EO-LNP dispersions
were freeze-dried for further analysis as well as for in vitro release
experiments.

Analytical Methods
FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of the isolated AL fractions
and the prepared LNPs as well as EO-LNPs (after freeze-drying of the
dispersions) were recorded on a Jasco FTIR-4100 Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (Jasco Corporation, MD, USA). After very fine
grinding of the samples in an agate mortar, potassium bromide (KBr)
discs were prepared with a lignin concentration of 2 wt % using a
Specac Mini-Pellets Press (Specac Inc., Fort Washington, USA). The
spectra were acquired in absorbance mode in the range of 4000–400
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 against a background of pure KBr. FTIR spectra of LNPs and EO-LNPs
were baseline corrected and normalized to an absorbance of 1 AU for
the maximum at wavenumber 1122 cm–1. Spectra of
the pure EOs were normalized correspondingly at their respective maxima
and then scaled for illustrative reasons in Figure 2.

Analytical Pyrolysis
Pellets from fine powdered freeze-dried
EO-LNPs and pure LNPs (1.5–2 mg) were pressed in a special
syringe and eventually directly pyrolyzed at 450 °C in a Pyrojector
II (SGE, Inc., USA) microfurnace pyrolysis chamber. Pyrolysis products
were separated in an HP 5890 Series II Plus gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard,
DE, USA) equipped with a Restek Rtx-1701 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.)
capillary column (Restek Corporation, PA, USA). Helium was used as
carrier gas at a pressure of 100 kPa in the pyrolyzer and 70 kPa in
the GC injector (280 °C, 1:20 split ratio). Oven temperature
was held initially at 45 °C for 4 min and then increased to 240
°C with a heating rate of 4 °C/min and finally at a rate
of 39 °C/min until 280 °C. A HP 5971A-MSD mass spectrometer
was used in EI mode at 70 eV, and scans from m/z 35 to m/z 500 were run
in 0.7 s cycles. Pyrolysis products were identified by mass spectra
interpretation and comparison with NIST and Wiley computer libraries
and the reference literature.39−42 For each pyrogram, normalized at the most intense
peak, the relative peak areas of 29 principal phenolic lignin pyrolysis
products as well as the respective essential oil components were determined.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Size and size distribution
of the LNP and EO-LNP suspensions were obtained by dynamic light scattering
(DLS). Measurements were carried out on a Zetasizer NanoZS instrument
(Malvern Instruments, U.K.) at 25 °C using the noninvasive back
scattering (NIBS) technique with a detection angle of 173°, which
is less sensitive to multiple scattering effects compared to the more
conventional 90° geometry.43 The measured
DLS autocorrelation functions were analyzed using the cumulant method
to obtain the average hydrodynamic diameter of the particles and the
polydispersity index (PDI)44 and by CONTIN
algorithm to obtain the size distribution.45 Results are presented as an average of three measurements per sample
with the respective standard deviations.

Reversed Phase HPLC: Essential Oil Loading and in Vitro Release
Studies
LNPs and EO-LNPs were analyzed using a Varian 2510
HPLC system with a Varian 2550 variable wavelength detector using
acetonitrile–water as a mobile phase (70:30 mixture (v/v),
0.7 mL/min flow, detection at 280 nm) and a EC NUCLEODUR C18 Isis
(5 μm particle size, 4.6 mm × 150 mm) reversed phase HPLC
column (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany).
External calibration for quantification was done with dilutions of
the used pure essential oils. EO-LNP dispersions were injected after
dilution in the mobile phase, and freeze-dried samples were dissolved
in the mobile phase in the concentration of 1 mg/mL before injection.
Drug loading efficiency (DLE) and drug loading capacity (DLC) were
calculated according to the following equations as published elsewhere:28 1   2  

Release of EOs from
the respective LNPs was investigated by a dialysis method, based on
the method published by Dai et al.28 EO-LNP
dispersions as well as control samples of the respective pure EO dispersions
were filled into a dialysis bag, which was immersed into 18 mL of
distilled water inside a 20 mL headspace vial, closed with a rubber
stopper, and sealed with Parafilm. Freeze-dried EO-LNPs (15 mg/mL)
were added to 0.9 mL of distilled water, gently redispersed, and filled
inside a dialysis bag, which was successively used as described above
(Figure 5b). Samples
from the dialysis-receiving container were taken with a Hamilton 100
μL glass syringe through the rubber stopper and directly injected
into the HPLC system to avoid evaporation of essential oil. Water
in the dialysis-receiving container was changed every 24 h and sampling
was conducted in 0.5 h time intervals within the first 2 h of experiment,
successively in 24 h periods.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
For preparation
of the samples for SEM, drops of the EO-LNP suspensions as well as
drops of redispersed freeze-dried EO-LNPs were adsorbed onto a glass
coverslip and air dried at 25 °C. The cover slips were in turn
attached to aluminum stubs using carbon tape and sputter-coated with
gold in a Balzers MED 010 unit (Oerlikon Balzers, Balzers, Liechtenstein).
SEM analysis was conducted with a JSM 6010LA electron microscope (JEOL
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
