Surface
grafting from diazonium solutions triggered by localized
surface plasmon has been investigated. An organic layer that is 20–30
nm thick is easily grafted onto gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by visible-light
illumination in a few minutes without any reducing agent or molecular
photocatalyst. Grafting depends on the wavelength and polarization
of the incident light. As a consequence, the orientation of the growth
of the layer deposited on the AuNPs can be controlled by polarized
light. Grafting is also highly enhanced between adjacent AuNPs or
at the corners of triangular AuNPs, that is, in plasmonic hot spots.
These results clearly demonstrate plasmon enhancement and strongly
suggest that the transfer of hot electrons from the excited plasmonic
NPs to the diazonium is the main mechanism. They also confirm that
localized surface plasmon resonance can induce nanolocalized electrochemical
reactions, thus contributing to the field of “plasmonic electrochemistry”.

Introduction
Because localized surface
plasmons (LSPs) are able to enhance electric
fields in the very close vicinity of nanoparticle (NP) structures,
they allow to manipulate the interaction of light with matter on the
nanoscale. LSPs are excited when nanostructured materials with high
free-electron mobility interact with photons that match the resonance
energy of the electrons.1 This interaction
initially results in coherent oscillation of the electrons in space
and leads to the confinement of photon energy to the surface of nanostructured
materials. Local enhancement of the electromagnetic field is important
for optical and spectroscopic applications and leads to phenomena,
such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering,2,3 improved
efficiency of various nonlinear processes,4,5 and
surface-enhanced fluorescence.6

Many
researchers have recently addressed the question as to whether
chemical processes may be enhanced by plasmonic phenomena.7 Thus, many photochemical reactions8−11 that are promoted by the electromagnetic field-enhancement effect,
some of which are discussed below, have been studied. Light absorption
in the nanostructures also transfers energy to electrons in the conduction
band of the plasmonic material.12,13 This results in the
creation of a great number of “charge carriers” (electron–hole
pairs) or highly energetic electrons and holes known as “hot
electrons” and “hot holes”. They are generated
at and confined to the surface of the metallic NP or in its immediate
near field, and their influence on chemical reaction processes has
been investigated, creating a new field of so-called “hot electron-driven
chemistry”. As they are produced near the NPs, they can be
used to trigger chemical reactions involving reactants adsorbed on
their surface.14,15

This concept was pioneered
by Ertl et al.,16 Chumanov and Cotton,17,18 and has since been extensively
developed by many groups. For example, Christopher et al.19,20 have suggested that hot electrons play a role in activating a number
of oxidation reactions on plasmonic clusters of 50 nm Ag nanocubes
under low-intensity visible-light illumination. Hot electrons can
be combined with thermal energy to drive commercially important chemical
reactions, such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH3 oxidation, at significantly lower temperatures than those
of pure thermal processes.19 Mukherjee
et al.21 demonstrated recently that if
another atom or molecule that can accept the electron is nearby, the
hot electron can jump into the acceptor’s electronic states.
In their study, hydrogen molecules were adsorbed on gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs). Some of the hot electrons transfer into the closed shells
of the hydrogen molecules to populate the antibonding orbital and
cause the two hydrogen atoms to dissociate. A number of studies have
reported charge-driven reactions, such as the oxidation of para-aminothiophenol to form 4,4′-dimercaptoazobenzene
on roughened silver surfaces during surface-enhanced Raman spectrocopy
measurement22,23 or the reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds.24,25 Recently, Xie and Schlucker also
demonstrated that hot electrons generated by the nonradiative decay
of LSP can be transferred to reactants on a metal surface and insisted
on the importance of the oxidation counter-half-reaction in plasmon-mediated
catalysis.26

Many recent investigations
have also shown that plasmonic nanostructures
can convert light directly into electrical energy.12,27−31 This phenomenon can be used to develop alternative solar-energy
harvesting devices32−34 or design efficient photodetectors with spectral
responses circumventing band gap limitations.35−37 Finally, some
“hot-carrier devices” have been demonstrated, with hot
electrons or hot holes, generated by localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) being injected into other materials, such as graphene,38,39 various semiconductors,40,41 single-molecule junctions,42 or phase-changing materials43,44 thus enabling plasmon-induced phase transitions.

In view of
all of these results, it can be stated that plasmonic
substrates based on metallic NPs (plasmonic electrodes) have a potential
for triggering specific “photoreactions” on the basis
of hot electron and hot hole charge-transfer reactions. From an electrochemical
point of view, this means that plasmon-induced electrochemistry is
likely to become an important new research field on the basis of the
use of plasmonic electrodes and the enhancement of various electrochemical
reactions triggered by irradiation of the electrode at the wavelength
of the LSPR band. Recent reports have explored this field.45,26,46−49

Among the many electrochemical
reduction reactions that can be
used to study plasmon-induced electrochemistry, that of diazonium
salts is well adapted as it leads to the grafting of thin compact
layers, about 5 nm thick, covering the whole electrode.50 The layers are pinhole-free and can be used
in many applications, such as adhesion primers51 or metal/molecule/metal junctions.52 When deposited on AuNPs, they cause a shift of the plasmon band
that can therefore be used to detect the grafting process.53,54 The layers can be easily evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) spectroscopy.

Photoinduced
diazonium reduction to modify electrode surfaces has
been recently investigated. Using UV or visible-light irradiation
modified layers were grafted.55 The authors
showed that no deposition was observed under visible irradiation unless
there was a photocatalyst (PTCL) in the solution. Under visible-light
irradiation, the charge-transfer complex between the PTCL and diazonium
leads to aryl radical formation, which is responsible for the grafting
onto the electrode surface. In other studies, the formation of the
aryl radical and photochemical grafting of an organic layer, using,
a Ru(bipyridine)32+ complex as a photoredox
sensitizer was developed.56,57 This process provided
a thin film close to a monolayer. The poor absorption of visible light
by the charge-transfer complex leads to low efficiency of these photochemical
reactions.

Diazonium salt reduction can also be spontaneous
on some surfaces
and can be triggered by thermal effects. In both cases, very thin
layers (less than 4 nm) are usually generated. The efficiency of this
grafting process and thickness of the grafted layer depend on the
deposition time, solvent, and nature of the diazonium salt.58−60

In this work, we will use electrodes bearing AuNPs of various
shapes
to trigger the reduction of diazonium under irradiation by visible
light. Such plasmonic surfaces absorb light at wavelengths in the
visible region and concentrate light in a very small area. These characteristics
make them good candidates for replacing the molecular PTCL in this
system. They are also known to generate hot electrons that may be
transferred to the diazonium salts and induce their electroreduction
and the deposition of an organic layer on the AuNPs.

The main
questions will therefore be: Can hot electrons, generated
from LSPR, be used to graft layers on NPs from a diazonium solution
without using any PTCL? Can we demonstrate that the observed effects
are due to a plasmonic effect? Can we control the growth of the layer
on the NPs? Can we induce anisotropic growth of ultrathin organic
layers that can be used to create new plasmonic devices?61 The results described here will also contribute
to the experimental demonstration that LSPR can induce electrochemical
reactions thus contributing to “plasmon-induced electrochemistry”.

Results
and Discussion
We first used an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode
bearing AuNPs
deposited by an electrochemical method.54 Such substrates show LSPR at 600 nm in air, and SEM reveals NPs
with an average diameter of 120 nm randomly deposited on the ITO.
Electrodes were plunged into the diazonium solution either in the
dark or with visible-light irradiation. In the first situation, spontaneous
grafting arises, whereas in the second, plasmon-induced grafting may
occur. After these treatments, the LSPR of the plasmonic electrode
is recorded and compared to that of the initial LSPR signal.53,54

After a one-hour immersion in a bisthienylbenzene (BTB) diazonium
solution, BTB appears to graft spontaneously onto the AuNPs, as evidenced
by a small LSPR redshift (Figure 1a) of only ∼7 nm, which corresponds to a thickness
of less than 3 nm.53 SEM does not detect
any significant layer of BTB on the NPs under these conditions. These
experiments have also been performed at 45 and 60 °C in thermalized
bath. No significant spontaneous grafting can be observed when the
surface of the NP is thermalized at these temperatures.

vs plasmon-induced grafting from diazonium solution.

and after (red curve) immersion in the BTB diazonium solution for
an hour: (a) in a dark chamber; (b) under light irradiation; (c) SEM
image of a plasmonic electrode after 1 h irradiation showing isotropic
growth of BTB on AuNPs. Note that isotropic growth similar to that
reported in (c), leading to 15–25 nm of BTB grafted on the
NP is obtained in only 5 min of low-intensity irradiation at 35 klx,
which indicates that the BTB deposition under irradiation is much
faster than spontaneous grafting; and (d) Anisotropic growth of the
BTB layer in nanogaps under irradiation with nonpolarized light. The
growth is preferentially localized between adjacent AuNPs separated
by gaps of 20–30 nm. Irradiation is with visible light for
5 min and with nonpolarized light. Isotropic growth is observed around
isolated spherical NPs.

Figure 1b
shows
the plasmon shift observed if the same electrode is irradiated in
the BTB diazonium solution for 1 h. The redshift is now 46 nm, larger
than that observed in the dark. It indicates that BTB has been grafted
onto the AuNPs and that it is thicker than that generated in the dark.
Following our previous study, the thickness of the BTB layer can be
estimated from the LSPR shift at close to 15–20 nm.53 The SEM image of the substrate (Figure 1c) confirms that the AuNPs
are covered by a uniform layer, 15–25 nm thick, of organic
material; growth seems to be isotropic under these conditions. This
result demonstrates that light-induced BTB grafting on AuNPs is possible
and suggests that this effect is due to plasmons.

Plasmon-induced
phenomena are known to be enhanced with nonpolarized
light in nanogaps between two or more NPs, also called hot spots.
The electromagnetic field intensity in such nanogaps increases when
the distance decreases and can theoretically be enhanced up to ∼105-fold over that of the incident light. Figure 1d shows a region of the plasmonic electrode
where AuNPs are separated by 20–30 nm. Independent of their
relative orientation, BTB is preferentially grafted between NPs. Eight
AuNPs are connected in a chain despite the fact that they are not
linearly disposed, whereas isotropic growth is still observed around
isolated spherical NPs. This result establishes that hot sites are
capable of inducing anisotropic BTB growth and demonstrates that the
light-induced BTB grafting on AuNPs is induced by a plasmonic effect.

The rate of a chemical reaction can be influenced by the presence
of a plasmonic field by several different mechanisms.

One possibility
is rapid conversion of the absorbed light energy
into heat that could raise the local temperature and enhance the rate
of the chemical reaction. Note that the temperature increase of AuNPs
upon continuous-wave (CW) excitation at the LSPR wavelength cannot
exceed 10 °C, as calculated recently by Govorov et al.62 for gold nanosphere of 50–100 nm diameter
and by Keblinski et al.63 Such temperature
increase is not large enough to generate BTB layers with thickness
between 15 and 25 nm by thermally activated spontaneous grafting,
as demonstrated in the control experiments at 45 and 60 °C performed
in the dark. To further study this point, experiments were performed
using polarized light. When an Au NP plasmonic substrate is irradiated,
the plasmons are excited along the axis of the polarization of the
light used but not in the perpendicular direction. Consequently, we
expect that anisotropic grafting may be observed using polarized light
if it is due to plasmons, whereas isotropic growth should be mainly
seen if it is due to a plasmon-induced thermal effect despite the
use of polarized light. Indeed, local anisotropic heating under CW
excitation, which we employed, can be obtained with only specific
nanostructures such as trimer NP’s assembly, where two large
NPs play the role of a nano-optical antenna, whereas the small NPs
in the plasmonic hot spot act as nanoheaters.62

Figure 2a,b
shows
the result obtained after 5 min of irradiation.

Figure 2 Anisotropic growth of
the BTB layer under irradiation with polarized
light. SEM images of a plasmonic electrode after 5 min of irradiation
with polarized light. (a) Anisotropic growth of the BTB layer preferentially
localized along the polarization direction for isolated NPs or along
the three corners of a triangular NP. (b) Anisotropic growth of the
BTB layer preferentially localized along the polarization direction
between adjacent AuNPs separated by gaps of 30–40 nm. Inset:
Simulation of the electric field enhancement from ref (64).

A notable observation is that BTB growth is never isotropic,
and
preferential growth along the direction parallel to that of the polarized
light is always observed. Indeed, small spherical particles are now
surrounded by a nonuniform organic layer, and growth occurs preferentially
at the sharp tips of the AuNPs or on the corner of a triangular NP
(Figure 2a). These
growth features match the field-enhancement pattern under polarized
light calculated by simulation.64,65 Furthermore, preferential
growth also occurs in the small spaces between two NPs. Indeed, gaps
between two adjacent NPs, when parallel to the polarization, are preferentially
filled with organic material, and this can connect two NPs initially
separated by 30–40 nm (Figure 3b) and generate metal/molecule/metal junctions easily.
Note also that thicker BTB layers are deposited on smaller NPs, whereas
the local temperature of spherical NPs has been calculated to decrease
when the NP’s diameters decrease.

600 nm (blue filter). (a) Absorption spectra of the Au-triangle substrate
after different irradiation times, (b) SEM image of Au triangles after
8 min irradiation with visible light: blue filter, and (c) SEM image
at higher magnification.

These results completely rule out plasmon-induced thermal
effect
as the source of the grafting.

Another possibility is a strong
interaction of electromagnetic
irradiation with the adsorbed materials near the AuNPs (in the present
case, BTB diazonium salt) at LSPR frequencies. This can enhance the
molecular absorption and photochemical reaction. However, in the present
case, the molecule used does not absorb at the LSPR wavelength (the
BTB diazonium generated using tert-butylnitrite and
the BTB grafted on the surface do not absorb light above 550 nm) and
the reaction is not a photochemical reaction triggered in the visible
range (unless a PTCL is use) or near IR but an electrochemical reaction
involving reduction of the diazonium salts.56,57 This strongly suggests that the observed plasmon-induced BTB growth
is due to the production of hot electrons on the Au NP surfaces that
can be used to reduce diazonium.

Hot electrons can only be generated
upon LSP excitation and are,
therefore, strongly correlated with the wavelength of the light used
for irradiation. The effect of the incident-light wavelength on BTB
grafting on the plasmonic electrodes was therefore studied. The white
light used for irradiation was filtered prior to being sent onto the
substrate. Figure SI1 shows the transmission
spectra of the two filters (red and blue) used. The red filter absorbs
all light at wavelengths below 600 nm, whereas the blue filter absorbs
light above 700 nm. Depending on where the absorption maximum of the
plasmonic substrate is, we can choose a filter for the incident light
to excite or to not excite the LSPR of the AuNPs.

These experiments
were performed on the Au-triangle array generated
on ITO by nanosphere lithography (NSL). This type of Au-triangle nanostructure
exhibits LSPR at ∼880 nm, with a plasmon resonance band between
750 and 1000 nm (Figure 4). These plasmonic substrates were chosen so that the energy of the
light absorbed by the plasmon is small and because grafting organic
materials from diazonium salts using near-IR light has never been
reported in the literature and has proved to be impossible. As the
BTB diazonium salt prepared using tert-butylnitrite
absorbs the UV with a tail at 450 nm, its direct excitation will also
occur only when the blue filter is used.

light above 600 nm (red filter). (a) Absorption spectra of the Au-triangle
substrate after different irradiation times: red filter, (b) SEM image
of Au triangles after 4 min irradiation with visible light: red filter,
and (c) SEM image at higher magnification.

The first experiment to graft BTB on a plasmonic substrate
was
performed with the blue filter. The optical extinction spectra of
the substrate in air after 2 and 8 min of irradiation in a BTB diazonium
solution and after careful rinsing of the sample are shown in Figure 3.

The plasmon
resonance peaks are observed at the same wavelength
(∼882 nm) even when the irradiation time is increased to 8
min (blue curve). This result indicates that irradiation with UV–visible
light (below 600 nm) does not modify the plasmonic substrates. Note
that these wavelengths are more prone to generate photografting if
the process is not induced by a plasmonic effect. An important result
is that if the LSP is not excited, BTB grafting is not observed. Further
characterization was carried out by SEM. The SEM image (Figure 3b) shows clearly the very nice
lithographic Au-triangle array generated on ITO by NSL. Figure 3c with high magnification of
the nanostructure indicates that there is no organic material around
the Au triangles. This result demonstrates that BTB is not photografted
on this substrate using UV and visible light below 600 nm. Direct
excitation of the BTB diazonium salt by light does not trigger significant
BTB growth on the substrate with this irradiation time.

A similar
experiment was performed on another Au-triangle substrate.
However, in this experiment, a red filter was used instead of a blue
filter. The main purpose of using the red filter is to excite the
LSP resonance at 880 nm. Absorption spectra were recorded after several
irradiation times (Figure 4).

Figure 4 shows that
the plasmon peak wavelength is considerably red-shifted after 2 and
4 min irradiations. These red shifts can be attributed to BTB grafting
on the Au triangles. The redshift increases from 30 to 115 nm when
the irradiation time increases from 2 to 4 min. This reveals that
the thickness of the grafted BTB layer increases with the increase
in irradiation time. The plasmonic substrate generated after 4 min
irradiation using the red filter was characterized by SEM. The SEM
images show clearly that BTB preferentially grows at the three corners
of the Au NP triangles, where the local electric field enhancement
is the greatest.65 This result demonstrates
that BTB growth is driven by a plasmonic effect and by the enhanced
electromagnetic field. It eliminates again the thermal effect as a
possible reason for grafting as well as an incident-light effect because
light below 600 nm does not trigger BTB growth. Furthermore, it strongly
suggests that hot electron diffusion length in the BTB layers can
be above 20 nm, which is compatible with activation-less transport
above 22 nm thicknesses recently reported in BTB molecular junction.66

The Au triangles were further characterized
by AFM (Figure 5).
Comparison of Figure 5a,b (2D model) or Figure 5c,d (3D model) shows
clearly the change in shape of the Au triangles as a result of BTB
grafting. The two images inset in Figure 5a,b, that is, the cross-section across two
neighboring Au triangles before and after grafting BTB indicate that
they only change their lateral dimensions, whereas they are almost
the same height before and after grafting (∼45 nm, insets Figure 5a,b). This result
demonstrates that BTB is not grafted on top of the Au triangles. To
prove that it is also not grafted on the ITO surface, a scratch experiment
was performed. Figure SI2 shows that a
very shallow groove (∼0.4–0.6 nm) is created by scratching
in the contact mode, with 2 V applied to the AFM tip (with this voltage
set point BTB grafted on ITO is removed).67 This result proves that there is no BTB on ITO and is confirmed
by the electrochemical response of ferrocene solution to the Au-triangle
array after plasmonic grafting of BTB. Indeed, the electrochemical
response of ferrocene (Fc) on these modified electrodes shows the
typical electrochemical behavior of the ferrocene redox couple at
the potential usually observed on a bare electrode and is quite different
from that observed when BTB is grafted electrochemically.68 This result clearly indicates that BTB is grafted
only near the NPs and not on the whole AuNPs/ITO surface.

solution. AFM images of Au triangles before (a, c) and after (b, d)
plasmonic grafting of BTB using visible near-IR light for 4 min: red
filter.

Finally, polarized light irradiation
was used because such a plasmonic
electrode shows two different polarization axes. The first one corresponds
to an electric field orientation of the incident-light going from
the middle of a triangle side to one corner (Figure 6a). In the second, the electric field is
parallel to one triangle side and is oriented at 30° from the
first one. The calculated location of the electromagnetic field enhancement
is shown in the insets of Figure 6a,b, and differs for the two polarizations.65 In the former, the electromagnetic field enhancement
and, consequently, hot electron generation is localized at one corner
of each triangle, whereas in the latter they are located at the other
two corners of each triangle. The areas of electromagnetic field enhancement,
calculated theoretically, are thus complementary for these two different
polarizations. Experimental results show clearly the anisotropic growth
of BTB on the corners of the triangle with minimal growth on the side
of the triangle. Moreover, when light is polarized from the middle
of a triangle side to one corner (Figure 6a), growth occurs mainly on this corner,
whereas when light is polarized along one side of the triangle, growth
occurs on two corners. The areas of preferential growth, observed
experimentally, are thus complementary for the two different polarizations
and fully match the plasmon-enhanced electromagnetic field.

symmetry axis and (b) with polarized light along the first symmetry

maximum of the E-field. From ref (65).

Conclusions
In summary, surface grafting of an organic layer
from diazonium
solutions triggered by LSP have been demonstrated experimentally.
An organic layer 20–35 nm thick is easily grafted onto various
AuNPs by visible-light illumination in a few minutes without the presence
of any reducing agent or molecular PTCL. Such grafting is not due
to a spontaneous process nor due to thermal effects or direct light
illumination. Grafting occurs only around the AuNPs and not significantly
on the ITO between the AuNPs. It strongly depends on the wavelength
of the incident light. UV–visible light, which does not excite
the LSPs, does not trigger grafting on NP triangles, whereas near-IR
light, which excites the LSP, causes selective grafting. This strongly
depends on the polarization of the incident light, which can be used
to control the orientation of the growth of the deposited layer on
the Au NP surface. Grafting is highly enhanced between adjacent AuNPs
or at the corners of triangular AuNPs, that is, in plasmonic hot spots.
The process thus provides a convenient way for imaging the plasmon-enhanced
electromagnetic field.

We, therefore, propose that the key element
for driving this reaction
is the hot electrons, which are generated by the plasmonic substrate
and transferred to the diazonium salt absorbed on the metal surface.
Once plasmon-induced electron transfer is achieved, the usual subsequent
chemical reactions leading to grafting occur. Our results confirm
that LSPR can induce nanolocalized electrochemical reactions, thus
contributing to the new domain of “plasmon-induced nanoelectrochemistry”.
For a full understanding of plasmon-driven electrochemical reactions,
several experiments on similar molecules or with other electrochemical
reactions are needed. Independent of this fundamental understanding,
many applications of plasmon-induced diazonium electroreduction can
be foreseen for the localized functionalization of NPs and anisotropic
growth of many organic materials on gold nanorods or on plasmonic
hot spots of various geometries. We anticipate that this process will
have a strong impact in several fields such as nanophotonics and molecular
electronics as NP/molecule/NP junctions can be easily generated by
this method.

Experimental Procedures
Two types
of the plasmonic substrates (Au NP triangles obtained
using NSL and electrochemical AuNPs), prepared on ITO electrochemically
and by gold vapor deposition through polystyrene (PS) templates, were
used.

Electrodeposition of AuNPs
ITO electrodes were cleaned
by sonication for 20 min in dilute alkaline Extran solution (Merck),
then carefully rinsed with distilled water and then ethanol; they
were stored in ultrapure Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm–1) until required for Au NP electrodeposition. Electrodeposition was
performed by the chronoamperometry technique in a stirred aqueous
solution of 2 × 10–3 M KAuCl4 and
0.25 M Na2CO3. The reference was a saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) and the counter-electrode was a stainless
steel grid. The solution was maintained under argon atmosphere during
the whole experiment. AuNPs were deposited on ITO electrodes at a
constant potential and a controlled total charge current density.54

Elaboration of Triangular AuNPs as a Plasmonic
Substrate by
NSL
A hexagonal close-packed self-assembly of PS spheres
as a template for the fabrication of plasmonic structures on ITO was
first obtained. Deposition of PS nanospheres on ITO was performed
as follows: First, the PS spheres are diluted in ethanol/Milli-Q water
(1:1 in volume, 2.5 wt %) and the suspension is sonicated to break
up the large agglomerations of spheres. Then, a droplet of 10 μL
of this suspension is spread slowly on a microscope slide, which is
tilted at an angle of 45° into a petri dish containing 30 mL
of Milli-Q water and 10 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (2 wt %
in water). The microspheres slide down onto the water surface, where
they form a stable film after a few minutes. In a final step, the
close-packed monolayer of PS spheres is transferred slowly on a clean
hydrophilic GC or ITO substrate by placing it under the monolayer
and withdrawing it slowly from the solution. Before transfer, ITO
substrates are treated with an RCA solution to obtain a hydrophilic
surface. After transfer, perfect areas of hexagonally close-packed
monolayers up to a few square centimetres are easily obtained using
this technique. These monolayers of PS templates are used as masks
for metal evaporation, the masks then being removed to get the triangular
structures of the mask interstices over a very large area. The topography
and dimensions of the triangular arrays can be readily controlled
using different sizes of nanospheres. In the present case, the diameter
of the spheres used for construction of the triangles was 0.5 μm.

LSPR Measurements
The plasmonic substrate is fixed
as the bottom window in a small home-made photochemical cell, which
is placed on the holding support of a microscope. Then, the cell is
filled with the precursor solution (amine + tert-butylnitrite).
The sample is irradiated by a white lamp; filters or polarizers are
used to select the irradiation conditions. Absorption measurements
are carried out with an Ocean Optics HR 4000 UV–vis spectrophotometer
coupled with a fiber optics system, which makes it possible to analyze
an area of 80 μm × 80 μm.

BTB Diazonium Solution
and BTB Electrochemical Grafting
1-(2-Bisthienyl)-4-aminobenzene
(BTAB) was synthesized as previously
described. Grafting onto substrates was performed using in situ diazonium
salt formation: under argon, 30 equiv of tert-butylnitrite
was added to a 0.5 mM solution of BTAB in acetonitrile containing
0.1 M of tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate.
When necessary, BTB was grafted electrochemically by multiscan cyclic
voltammetry (15 successive cycles) between 0.3 and −0.5 V/SCE
at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. By this means, films
less than 15 nm thick are generated. A full description of the measurement
of the thickness of BTB on gold gratings generated by e-beam lithography
is given in a previous publication.53

AFM and SEM Characterization
AFM experiments were carried
out in the tapping mode. Silicon AFM probes (Tap300-G), with a stiffness
constant of 40 N/m and a resonance frequency of 300 kHz, were used.
SEM experiments were carried out using a Zeiss supra 40 apparatus.
