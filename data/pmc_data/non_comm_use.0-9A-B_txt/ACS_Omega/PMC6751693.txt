Monitoring
of long-term stability of proteins on paper-based membranes
is important as it is directly related to paper-based sensor fabrication.
By using a simple piezo printhead inkjet printer, recombinant proteins
and antibodies were printed on paper-based membranes to test their
stability and sensitivity under varying lengths of storage and temperature
conditions. Our data show that a printed IgG-HRP antibody on simple
printing paper maintains >50% functionality up to ∼2 months
under 4 and −20 °C storage. Antibodies printed on polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) and nitrocellulose showed 5.3 and 9.7% decreases,
respectively, in initial signal intensities compared to printing paper.
Prostate-specific membrane antigen and tumor necrosis factor alpha
recombinant proteins printed on paper-based membranes can be detected
by antibodies, and antibody signal intensities can be detected up
to 28 days after storage at 4 and −20 °C when printed
on PVDF membrane or printing paper. These data suggest that printed
proteins on simple printing paper and PVDF membrane can maintain their
functionality up to few months when stored at 4 °C or lower and
can be potentially applied in paper-based sensor development.

Introduction
Detection and sensing of viruses, pollutants,
and other related
proteins have received much attention with the Zika and MERS outbursts
in recent years.1−5 To be considered a good detection and sensing platform, stability
and detection sensitivity as well as ease of use and maintenance should
be guaranteed.6,7 There are several careful studies
of paper-based sensing membranes that provide a cheap and convenient
option for virus/pollutant detection.8−12 To date, a large number of novel paper-based sensing
technologies, including nanoparticle-based and electronic-based sensors,
have been developed to increase detection sensitivity.13−16 However, many of these technologies require a significant amount
of detection time, function only under certain storage conditions
and are quite often expensive. As alternatives to these high technology
sensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular
in clinical use.17−19 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing
antibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were
detected by detection antibodies.20,21 Colorimetric/immunosensing
platforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant
detection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based
sensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage
conditions.22−24 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing
membrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance
protein/antibody adsorption and stability,25−27 but comparative
studies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different
paper-based membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed
proteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research,
we conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity
on three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term
monitoring of printed proteins/antibodies on paper-based platforms
with varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal
storing period and temperature for printed proteins.

Results
Printing and
Detection of Anti-IgG-HRP Antibody on a Paper-Based
Platform
First, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL aliquots
of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody were loaded on a Piezo printhead inkjet
printer and printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Figure 1A,B). Data suggest that IgG-HRP antibodies were successfully
printed on the paper-based membrane (Figure 1B). The printed IgG-HRP antibodies on paper-based
membranes were then incubated with the HRP substrate, and the HRP
signal intensity was recorded. Chemiluminescence intensities from
100 μg/mL of the printed IgG-HRP antibody gave values of 4123
± 1214, 4325 ± 385, and 4936 ± 325 (arbitrary unit)
for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively
(Figure 1C).

Stability Measurement of Membrane-Printed IgG-HRP
Three
different paper-based membranes printed with the IgG-HRP antibody
were stored at room temperature (r.t.), 4 °C or −20 °C
for 1–180 days, and the HRP signal was monitored (Figure 2A). The data suggest
that the signal intensity from IgG-HRP printed on printing paper decreased
by half on days 56.3 and 57.1 (from 0.8 cm diameter dot) under 4 and
−20 °C storage conditions, respectively, while that at
r.t. was 6.7 days (Figure 2B–D). The chemiluminescence intensity of IgG-HRP printed
on both nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes decreased by half on day
1.3 and day 2.5, respectively. Storage temperature does not induce
>10% changes in the signal for nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes.
No chemiluminescence signals from the printed IgG-HRP antibody were
detected after 6 months of storage for printing paper or nitrocellulose
and PVDF membranes.

Detection of Printed PSMA and TNF-α
on a Paper-Based Platform
Prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α) recombinant proteins were printed on printing
paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes (Figure 3A,B). After the designated storage period,
PSMA/TNF-α printed paper strips were incubated with antibodies-HRP,
and HRP signals were monitored. The chemiluminescence signal intensity
from anti-PSMA and anti-TNF-α antibodies conjugated with HRP
increased as the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-α increased
(Figure 3C,D). PSMA
and TNF-α printed on printing paper showed the highest signal
intensity from antibody-HRP (2016 and 2786, respectively, from a 0.8
cm diameter dot, arbitrary unit), followed by PVDF (1073 and 1932,
respectively) and nitrocellulose membrane (496 and 693, respectively).

Stability Monitoring of Paper-Based Sensors of PSMA and TNF-α
Printed PSMA and TNF-α were stored at r.t., 4, or −20
°C for 28 days, and chemiluminescence signal intensities from
antibody-HRP were monitored. Signal intensity from printed PSMA was
reduced by half on days 3.3, 3.1, and 2.6 for −20, 4 °C,
and r.t. storage, respectively, for printing paper (Figure 4A), while that of nitrocellulose
was 0.9 ± 0.2 (Figure 4B). Times to reach half intensities compared to the original
signal for printed PSMA on the PVDF membrane were 4.1, 3.8, and 2.9
days for −20, 4 °C, and r.t. storage (Figure 4C). Signal intensity from printed
TNF-α was similar to printed PSMA, and the time to reach half
intensities of the initial signal was the longest for the PVDF membrane
followed by printing paper and nitrocellulose membrane (Figure 4D–F). No signals were
detected.

Discussion
We
first tested whether inkjet-printed proteins on a paper-based
membrane are functional. We focused on maintenance of functional ability
of printed HRP and structural integrity of printed PSMA and TNF-α
proteins. Varying concentrations of anti-IgG HRP antibodies (1–100
μg/mL) were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and
PVDF membranes, and the HRP substrate was added to detect signals
from the printed antibodies (Figure 1A). As low as 1 μg/mL of printed IgG-HRP antibodies
can be detected on paper-based membranes (Figure 1B,C), which suggests that piezo inkjet printing
does not induce changes or damage to the function of printed antibodies.
The concentration of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody versus the chemiluminescence
signal intensity from the printed IgG-HRP plot showed a linear relationship,
with R-squared values of 0.952, 0.931, and 0.946
for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively
(Figure 1C). These
data suggest that the signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP is a good
reflection of the concentration of IgG-HRP. IgG-HRP-printed printing
paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes were stored at three different
temperature conditions: r.t. (∼22 °C), 4, and −20
°C, to test the effect of storage temperature on printed protein
functionality and stability. Chemiluminescence signal intensities
from printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper and nitrocellulose
and PVDF membranes showed less than 10% variation, which suggests
that the binding capacity of the three paper-based membranes tested
are quite similar. The HRP signal from printed IgG-HRP on printing
paper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t.
However, 4 and −20 °C significantly increased printed
protein stability, and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50%
up to 60 days. Signals from printed HRP on printing paper can be detected
up to 180 days when stored at −20 °C. These data suggest
that storing temperature is critical in maintaining printed protein
functionalities. However, when the same protein was printed on the
nitrocellulose membrane, the signal intensity from HRP dropped rapidly
over the first 2 days, regardless of storage temperature (Figure 2C). Although protein
molecules bind to nitrocellulose membranes through hydrophobic interactions,
printed proteins on nitrocellulose membranes lose functionality in
a very short amount of time. IgG-HRP antibodies printed on PVDF also
showed significant signal intensity drops over the first 5 days; however,
signals from HRP can be detected up to 6 months when stored at 4 and
−20 °C.

We next tested whether printed proteins
on paper-based membranes
can be detected by antibodies. Two recombinant proteins, PSMA and
TNF-α, were printed and HRP conjugated antibodies against the
two proteins were used to detect the printed proteins. Although signals
from anti-PSMA-HRP and anti-TNF-α HRP were lower compared to
the directly printed IgG-HRP antibody, printed PSMA and TNF-α
were still detected when printed on all three paper-based membranes.
Signal intensities from the detection antibody were highest on printing
paper followed by PVDF and nitrocellulose membrane; however, they
did not show a linear relationship with the concentration of printed
PSMA and TNF-α (Figure 3C,D). These data may suggest that the signal intensities from
colorimetric/immunosensors may not exactly reflect the actual concentration
of antigens. We again tested whether printed proteins can be detected
by detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures.
It took ∼3 days for signals to be reduced to half of the initial
intensity from printed proteins on printing paper (Figure 3A,D). Storage temperatures
have a minimal effect on signal intensity in the first 3 days; however,
storing at −20 °C increases printed protein stability
after 7 days of storage.

Although the signals from printed PSMA
and TNF-α on PVDF
membranes were lower than those from printing paper, signal intensity
from printed proteins remains longer at 4 °C compared to that
from printing paper (Figure 4C,F). Storing at 4 and −20 °C also increases printed
protein stability compared to r.t. Printed PSMA and TNF-α antibodies
on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >50% activity for
4.1 and 3.5 days, respectively, when stored lower than 4 °C.
Two antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >25%
activity for 14.2 and 5.8 days when stored at −20 °C.
PSMA and TNF-α printed on the nitrocellulose membrane showed
significantly reduced signal intensities from detection antibodies
compared to printing paper and PVDF membranes (Figure 4B,E). Low-temperature storage increases the
chemiluminescence signal upon storing; however, the signal only lasts
up to 7 and 14 days for PSMA and TNF-α, respectively. These
data suggest that although nitrocellulose membranes are quite often
used for various protein detection purposes, immobilized protein stability
upon storing cannot be guaranteed compared to the PVDF membrane or
even simple printing paper.

However, our studies focus more
on protein stability and storage
temperature and not on detection sensitivity. Paper-based sensing
platforms adopting nanoparticles (plasmonic gold and quantum dot)
and microelectronics have detection limits up to pictograms of proteins.28 Although this study adopted a simple colorimetric
detection method using HRP, we believe that nanoparticles and even
electronic or mechanistic sensing methods can be applied in a paper-based
platform.29−34 Overall, our data suggest that proteins and antibodies printed on
simple printing paper can be stable up to several months upon storage
at low temperature. Our results can be further applied to developing
a simple and cost-effective antigen/virus/pollutant test based on
paper membranes.

Overall, our data also show that proteins printed
on simple printing
paper retain functionality for a long duration of time compared to
nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes when stored at low temperature.

grade water (Corning, Corning, NY) was loaded on the piezo printhead
printer and printed on printing paper or PVDF and nitrocellulose membranes.
IgG-HRP printed paper-based platforms were then cut into 1.5 ×
10 cm strips. Finally, 1 mL of ECL western blotting detection reagents
and the ImageQuant LAS 500 system (GE Healthcare) were used to record
chemiluminescence intensity from printed IgG-HRP (intensity from 0.8
cm diameter circular dot).

Stability Measurement of Membrane-Printed
IgG-HRP
IgG-HRP-printed
paper-based platforms (PVDF, nitrocellulose, and printing paper) were
stored at r.t. or 4 or −20 °C for the designated storage
period. After 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 60, 90, and 180 days of storage,
chemiluminescence intensity from printed IgG-HRP was monitored for
printed IgG-HRP stability.

the designated storage period, PSMA and TNF-α printed paper
sensors were incubated with 1:2000 diluted anti-TNF-α HRP and
anti-PSMA HRP followed by exposure to ECL western blotting detection
reagents. Chemiluminescence intensities were recorded and analyzed
with an ImageQuant LAS 500 and Bio-Rad Image Lab software (Hercules,
CA).
