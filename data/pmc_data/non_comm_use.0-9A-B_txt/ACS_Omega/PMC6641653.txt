The
synthesis of flexible rhenium(I)-based amide-functionalized
chalcogen-bridged tetranuclear metallacycles of general formula [{(CO)3Re(μ-ER)2Re(CO)3}2(μ-L)2] (1–8) was achieved by treating rhenium
carbonyl with dialkyl/diaryl chalcogenide (RE–ER; E = S and
Se) in the presence of ditopic flexible or semiflexible pyridyl ligand
with amide functionality (L = N,N′-bis(4-pyridylcarboxamide)-1,2-ethane (bpce) and N,N′-bis(4-(4-pyridylcarboxamide)phenyl)methane
(bpcpm)). Compounds 1–8 were formed by multicomponent
self-assembly under one-pot reaction conditions via oxidative addition
of dialkyl/diaryl chalcogenide to rhenium carbonyl with pyridyl ligands.
The resultant metallacyclophanes were characterized using elemental
analyses, infrared, ultraviolet–visible, and NMR spectroscopic
techniques. Metallacyclophanes 1–3 and 7 were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
methods. The solvent-induced structural change of flexible tetranuclear
metallacyclophane 2 was demonstrated by crystallizing 2 in dichloroethane and dimethylformamide. Molecular recognition
capabilities of 2 and 7 were studied with
few aromatic compounds containing ethereal linkages.

Introduction
Amide-based compounds
are the class of molecules that are important
for several chemical disciplines, where the amide functionality forms
key linkages in natural and synthetic macromolecules such as proteins,
polypeptides, and nylons.1 Compounds containing
amide functional groups are potentially useful in a wide range of
industrial applications and possess pharmacological interest.2 Amide functionality plays a major role in stabilizing
various systems through the hydrogen-bond acceptor (C=O group)
and hydrogen-bond donor (NH group) and also provides structural flexibility
to the systems by facile rotation of functional groups.3 For instance, cyclic oligoamides show an interesting
nanotubular structure and zeolite-like frameworks through intertube
NH···O=C hydrogen-bonding interactions.4 Metal-containing cyclic amides resemble to the
cyclic peptide structures. Moreover, the presence of an amide functional
group would facilitate the self-assembly process to achieve molecular
systems of higher dimensionality via hydrogen-bonding interaction
and selective sensing of anions and neutral molecules by providing
hydrogen-bonding pockets to the host.5 Amides
serve as binding sites, although they are self-organized to act cooperatively
within some convergent molecular architectures.5d Thus, the incorporation of organic linkers containing amide
functional groups in the formation of the metallacyclic structure
is essential and fascinating.

In the literature, only a handful
of examples are available pertinent
to the tetranuclear metallacyclophanes having amide functionality.6 By tuning the length and shape of the spacer,
a variety of tetranuclear metallacyclophanes have been developed.7 Mostly, rigid aromatic spacers were employed
to prepare these compounds.7e−7i Rectangular- or bowl-shaped tetranuclear metallacyclophanes were
accomplished by changing the bite angle of the donor site.8 Amide-functionalized tetranuclear metallacyclophanes
were probed as hosts for their selective sensing of various anions
and macromolecules such as fullerenes, proteins, and so forth, depending
on their size and shape.8,5d However, reports having
amide-containing rhenium metallacyclophanes are hardly available.9 With this background, we have attempted to synthesize
rhenium(I)-based tetranuclear metallacyclophanes containing flexible
linkers with amide functionality. In the present study, amide-functionalized
ditopic flexible ligands N,N′-bis(4-pyridylcarboxamide)-1,2-ethane
(bpce) and semi-flexible ligand N,N′-bis(4-(4-pyridylcarboxamide)phenyl)methane (bpcpm) were
chosen and utilized along with dialkyl/diaryl chalcogenide to react
with rhenium carbonyl to form rhenium(I)-based amide-functionalized
tetranuclear metallacyclophanes 1–8. Compounds 1–8 were characterized using infrared (IR), ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis), and NMR spectroscopic techniques. Some of the metallacyclophanes
were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
methods. The adaptive recognition property of 2 was studied
by crystallizing the compound in dichloroethane and dimethylformamide
(DMF). Molecular recognition capabilities of these metallacyclophanes
were analyzed with few aromatic compounds containing ethereal linkages.

Results
and Discussion
The multicomponent heteroligand self-assembly
of rhenium carbonyl,
dialkyl/diaryl dichalcogenide (RE–ER), and flexible azine ligands
with amide functionality (L = bpce and bpcpm) in the mesitylene medium
led to the formation of rhenium(I)-based amide-functionalized tetranuclear
metallacyclophanes of general formula [{(CO)3Re(μ-ER)2Re(CO)3}2(μ-bpce)2]
(1, ER = SC4H9; 2,
ER = SCH2C6H5; 3, ER
= SC5H4FeC5H5; and 4, ER = SeC6H5) and [{(CO)3Re(μ-ER)2Re(CO)3}2(μ-bpcpm)2] (5, ER = SC4H9; 6, ER = SCH2C6H5; 7, ER = SC6H5CH3; and 8, ER = SeC6H5) (Scheme 1). The formation of tetrarhenium compounds 1–8 was accomplished by the oxidative addition of dialkyl/diaryl
dichalcogenide (RE–ER) to rhenium carbonyl (CO)5Re–Re(CO)5 in the presence of flexible and semiflexible
amide-functionalized pyridyl linkers under facile one-pot reaction
conditions. The chalcogenide ligands were coordinated at the equatorial
sites of the fac-Re(CO)3 core via thiolato/selenolato
bridges, whereas flexible ditopic pyridyl linkers were connected at
axial sites by Re–N bonds that afforded chalcogen-bridged M4E4L2-type rhenacycles.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Amide-Functionalized Flexible Tetranuclear Metallacyclophanes 1–8
The resultant metallacyclophanes 1–8 were characterized
by IR, UV–vis, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic
techniques. The molecular structures were determined for metallacyclophanes 1–3 and 7 using single-crystal X-ray diffraction
methods. Compounds 1–8 were soluble in polar organic
solvents and were stable toward air, light, and moisture. Adaptation
of solvent-induced diverse geometry of flexible metallacyclophane 2 has been investigated in dichloroethane and DMF. Furthermore,
molecular recognition capabilities of 2 and 7 were studied with few aromatic compounds containing ethereal linkages.

IR spectra of compounds 1–8 displayed strong
bands in the range of ν 2029–1897 cm–1 for terminal carbonyl ligands of an octahedrally coordinated fac-Re(CO)3 core.10 The amide C=O stretching frequency of bpce/bpcpm appeared
as a weak band at around ν 1605–1681 cm–1. 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compounds 1–8 showed appropriate signals for the bridging ligands,
and the spectral data are given in the experimental section. Absorption
spectra of 1–4 displayed intense bands in the
higher energy region λmax 228–311 nm due to
ligand-centered transitions and weak bands in the lower energy region
λmax 369–383 nm due to metal-to-ligand charge
transfer (MLCT) transition, whereas 5–8 showed
the ligand-centered transitions in the region λmax 226–274 nm as intense bands and the MLCT transitions in the
region λmax 305–327 nm as less intense bands.11

Good-quality single-crystals of 1–3 and 7, suitable for X-ray diffraction
analyses, were obtained
by slow evaporation of saturated solution of compound in DMF/dichloroethane
at 5 °C. Details about data collection, solution, and refinement
are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. The
crystal structure of metallacyclophanes 1–3 revealed
that two [(CO)3Re(μ-SR)2Re(CO)3] building blocks were linked by two flexible N,N′-bis(4-pyridylcarboxamide)-1,2-ethane moieties
to afford the tetranuclear metallacyclophane [{(CO)3Re(μ-SR)2Re(CO)3}2(μ-bpce)2].

In the crystal structure of 1•DMF, each rhenium
center in the fac-Re(CO)3 core is coordinated
to one nitrogen atom of pyridyl group from the flexible amide-functionalized
ligand and two sulfur atoms of butyl sulfide that resulted into a
distorted octahedral geometry around it. The molecular structure of 1•DMF is shown in Figure 1. On the basis of the Re···Re
non-bonding distance, the longer and shorter Re···Re
distances of 1•DMF are found to be ∼10.59
and 3.82 Å, respectively. The pyridyl groups in the bpce bridging
ligand are arranged in nearly parallel manner because of the weak
π···π interaction with a centroid···centroid
distance of 3.512 Å. The amide–amide intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction is present between the N(5)–H(5) group and inward
O(15) of the bpce ligand at a distance of 2.011 Å.12 Three outward NH groups of 1•DMF
are having intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with carbonyl
oxygen of DMF (N(8)–H(8)···O(19): 2.054 Å;
N(5)–H(5)···O(15): 2.011 Å; and N(7)–H(7)···O(17):
1.950 Å). C–H···π interaction is
observed between C(66) of the methyl group of DMF and π cloud
of the pyridyl unit in the bpce ligand at a distance of 3.228 Å.13 These interactions with DMF contribute to the
metallacyclophane 1•DMF to fold up to attain a
V-shape structure.

To investigate the solvent-induced
adaptive recognition property
of 2 under two different solvent conditions, the metallacyclophane
[{(CO)3Re(μ-SCH2C6H5)Re(CO)3}2(μ-bpce)2] (2) was crystallized in both low and high polar solvents such
as dichloroethane and DMF. The molecular structure of 2 crystallized in dichloroethane is shown in Figure 2. Compound 2 crystallized in
the monoclinic space group P21/n and displayed a rectangular framework. Although a dichloroethane
molecule is available in the crystal lattice of 2, it
has been squeezed as it could not be modeled. The dimensions of 2 as defined by Re atoms are ∼17.94 × 3.80 Å.

Intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction is
observed between
the amide NH and oxygen of the carbonyl group projected inside (N(8)–H(8)···O(16):
2.072 Å; N(8)#1–H(8)#1···O(16)#1: 2.072
Å). Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction is observed between
the amide NH group projected outside and oxygen of the terminal carbonyl
group and oxygen of the amide functional group in the bpce ligand
present in the adjacent unit (N(3)–H(3)···O(14)
2.190 Å; N(7)–H(7)···O(16) 2.031 Å).

The molecular structure of 2•DMF is shown in Figure 3. 2•DMF
displayed a V-shaped structure, and on the basis of the Re···Re
nonbonding distance, the longer and shorter Re···Re
distances of 2•DMF are found to be ∼10.94
and 3.80 Å, respectively. The intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction (N(4)–H(4)···O(16): 2.038 Å)
is observed between N(4)–H(4) of an amide group and O(16) of
another amide group. DMF is occupied as a guest molecule inside the
cavity through hydrogen-bonding interaction. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction is observed between the outward amide NH group and carbonyl
group of DMF (N(5)–H(5)···O(17): 1.988 Å).
The molecular dimension and hydrogen-bonding interactions of 2•DMF are comparable to the molecular structure of 1•DMF.

The crystal structure of [{(CO)3(μ-SC5H4FeC5H5)2Re(CO)3}2(μ-bpce)2] (3)
showed a rectangular framework where each rhenium in the fac-Re(CO)3 core is coordinated to one nitrogen atom from
the flexible amide-containing pyridyl ligand and two sulfur atoms
from the ferrocene sulfide moiety, resulting into a distorted octahedral
geometry around the metal center. On the basis of the Re···Re
distance, the dimensions of 3 are found to be ∼17.91
and 3.79 Å. The molecular structure of 3 is shown
in Figure 4. All of
the four NHs of the bpce ligand have intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of DMF (N(4)–H(4)···O(10)
2.149 Å; N(3)–H(3)···O(9) 2.018 Å;
N(4)#1–H(4)···O(10)#1 2.149 Å; N(3)#1–H(3)#1···O(9)#1
2.018 Å). Another hydrogen-bonding interaction is also observed
between the C(45)–H(45C) of the methyl group in DMF and O(2)
of the oxygen atom in the terminal carbonyl group attached with the
rhenium metal center (Figure 5). The CH···π interaction is noticed
between the C(9)–H(9) of the cyclopentadienyl moiety of the
ferrocenyl group and Cp (centroid) of the ferrocenyl group in the
adjacent neighboring unit at a distance of 2.891 Å (Figure 6). Another CH···π
interaction is also perceived between C(44)–H(44) of the aldehydic
group in DMF and Cp (centroid) of the ferrocenyl group at a distance
of 2.925 Å.

The crystal structure
of 7•DMF displayed that
the two units of (CO)3Re(μ-SC6H5CH3)2Re(CO)3 building blocks are
linked by two N,N′-bis(4-(4-pyridylcarboxamide)phenyl)methane
ligands to furnish a tetranuclear hammock-shaped metallacyclophane.
Each rhenium in the fac-Re(CO)3 core is
coordinated to one nitrogen atom of pyridyl group from the amide-containing
bpcpm ligand and two sulfur atoms from the p-tolylsulfide
moiety, resulting into a distorted octahedral geometry around the
metal center. On the basis of the Re···Re non-bonding
distance, the longer and shorter Re···Re distances
of 7•DMF are found to be ∼22.68 and 3.80
Å, respectively. The Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot (ORTEP)
diagram of 7 is shown in Figure 7. The pyridyl groups in the bpcpm ligand
are arranged in a parallel fashion with weak π···π
interaction having a centroid···centroid distance of
3.792 Å.14 Intramolecular CH···π
interaction is observed between the CH of the phenyl group and π
cloud of the phenyl group of the bpcpm bridging ligand (CH(55)···π(centroid):
2.978 Å; CH(56)···π(centroid): 3.222 Å;
CH(27)···π(centroid): 3.642 Å; CH(28)···π(centroid):
3.172 Å). All of the four NH groups of the bpcpm ligand are involved
in the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction with the carbonyl
oxygen of DMF (NH(7)···O(17): 1.951 Å; NH(2)···O(18):
2.066 Å; NH(6)···O(20): 2.107 Å; NH(3)···O(19):
2.043 Å) (Figure 8).

hydrogen-bonding interactions between NH of metallacyclophane and
carbonyl oxygen of DMF.

A variety of NH···OC interactions have been
observed
in the molecular structure of the metallacyclophanes 1, 2, and 7 with DMF. Especially 1 and 2 adapted to a V-shaped structure upon interaction
with encapsulated DMF. These observations encouraged us to study the
molecular recognition capability of the metallacyclophanes quantitatively
with aromatic compounds containing ethereal linkages. For the host–guest
interaction studies, metallacyclophanes 2 and 7 were chosen as hosts owing to their better solubility. 1,3,5-Trimethoxybenzene,
2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde were
selected as guest molecules. UV–visible absorption and emission
spectrophotometric methods were employed to evaluate the binding ability
of hosts 2 and 7, and the experimental details
are given in the Supporting Information. During the spectral titration experiments, the concentration of
the guest species was kept constant, whereas the concentration of
the host was gradually increased. The absorption pattern of the guest
was found to enhance with incremental addition of the host that might
presumably be due to the formation of the host–guest complex
in the ground state. Linear regression has been carried out using
the change in the absorption intensity of the guest on Y-axis and the change in the concentration of the host on X-axis, and the resultant graph showed a good linear correlation.
The binding constant was calculated from the slope and intercept obtained
from the Benesi–Hildebrand double reciprocal plot.15 Overlay absorption spectra of the host in the
presence of various guests along with the linear regression plot are
given in the Supporting Information. In
the emission spectroscopic method, the emission intensity of the guest
was quenched with an increase in the concentration of the host that
might be accounted for the non-luminescent host–guest complex
formation in the excited state. Quenching constant was evaluated using
the Stern–Volmer equation obtained from the plot of I0/I and the concentration of
the host,16 where I and I0 are the fluorescent intensity of the guest
in the presence and absence of the host. Overlay emission spectra
of the host in the presence of various guests along with the Stern–Volmer
plot are given in the Supporting Information. The binding and quenching constants are given in Table 1.

These results showed
an efficient host–guest interaction
between the metallacyclophanes and guest molecules. The host–guest
binding interaction is attributed to the NH···O hydrogen-bonding
interaction between the metallacyclophane and aromatic compound. In
addition, other supramolecular interactions such as CH···π
and π···π interactions may also contribute
significantly.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
accomplished a facile synthesis of amide-functionalized
flexible tetranuclear metallacyclophanes of varying molecular dimensions.
The rhenium(I)-based tetranuclear metallacyclophanes were obtained
in one-pot reaction condition via an orthogonal-bonding approach.
The compounds were characterized by IR, UV–vis, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques. Molecular structures
of few metallacyclophanes were ascertained by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction methods. The adaptive recognition property of the flexible
tetranuclear metallacyclophanes was investigated by crystallizing
compound 2 in dichloroethane and DMF. The molecular recognition
capabilities of metallacyclophanes 2 and 7 were studied with few aromatic compounds containing ethereal linkages.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Studies
Good-quality
crystals of 1–3 and 7 suitable for
the single-crystal X-ray structure analysis were grown by slow evaporation
of concentrated solution of compound in DMF and dichloroethane at
5 °C. Single-crystal X-ray structural studies were performed
on a CCD Oxford Diffraction XCALIBUR-S diffractometer equipped with
an Oxford Instruments low-temperature attachment. Crystal data were
collected using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λα = 0.71073 Å). The strategy for the data collection
was evaluated by using the CrysAlisPro CCD software. The data were
collected by the standard ‘ψ–ω scan’
techniques and were scaled and reduced using CrysAlisPro RED software.
The structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXS) and refined
by full-matrix leastsquares calculations on F2 (SHELXL).19 A dichloroethane molecule
present in the crystal lattice of 2 was squeezed with
the Squeeze algorithm, and the structure was refined to convergence.20 The positions on all the atoms were obtained
by direct methods. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
The hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically constrained positions
and refined with isotropic temperature factors, generally 1.2 × Ueq of their parent atoms.
