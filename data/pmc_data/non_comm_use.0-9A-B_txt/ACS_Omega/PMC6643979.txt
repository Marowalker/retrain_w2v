Following
the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Plant in 2011, even the municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage
sludge (SS) in northeastern Japan became contaminated by radioactive
nuclides such as 137Cs and 134Cs. To understand
the state of radioactive cesium (r-Cs) in the incineration residues
of the municipal wastes, research groups studied the concentration
and the chemical form of r-Cs in the residues, as well as its water-leaching
behavior. In the present study, we conducted thermodynamic equilibrium
calculations to estimate the possible chemical forms of r-Cs in the
incineration residues. Thermodynamic data for cesium oxides and aluminosilicates
were collected and compiled into a new database to perform equilibrium
calculations for systems that include Cs. The calculation results
suggested that Cs (radiocesium and stable cesium) in municipal solid
waste was transformed into gaseous CsCl or crystalline aluminosilicate
at incineration temperatures and, when a molten aluminosilicate phase
(i.e., slag phase) was generated, a proportion of the Cs species was
dissolved into the slag phase. In the case of sewage sludge, Cs was
calculated to be transformed mostly into crystalline aluminosilicate
at incineration temperatures, whereas by analogy with the behaviors
of Na and K, Ca,Cs-phosphate double salts were also potential incineration
products. These results could account for the high leaching rates
of r-Cs from the MSW incineration fly ash and the low leaching rates
from the MSW incineration bottom ash and SS incineration fly ash reported
in earlier studies. In the case of dewatered SS that included a large
amount of slaked lime as a flocculant, it was exceptionally difficult
for the calculation to represent the fate of Cs, and we needed to
include the contribution of silica sand in a fluidized-bed combustor
in the equilibrium calculation to represent the low leaching rates
of alkali species from the dewatered SS fly ash. From the results
of the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and also from the calculated
standard Gibbs energy of cesium aluminosilicate formation/decomposition
reactions, the effects of waste composition and incineration temperature
on the fate of Cs were examined: High incineration temperature and
large amounts of Ca and Cl in the waste composition increased the
fraction of gaseous CsCl in the furnace and thus resulted in the high
distribution ratios of Cs in the fly ash of MSW and the high leaching
rates of Cs from the fly ash.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
environment in northeastern Japan was widely contaminated by
fallout radionuclides such as 134Cs and 137Cs
released following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Plant (FDNPP) caused by a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami
on March 11, 2011.1,2 Even the municipal solid waste
(MSW) and sewage sludge (SS) in northeastern Japan became contaminated
by radioactive Cs species (r-Cs) due to the fallout contamination
of soil, forests, and sediments outside the residences.3−5 In Japan, about 80% of the household MSW6,7 and
70% of the SS8 are thermally treated at
incineration or melting plants for the purpose of waste-volume reduction
and public health protection. Such thermal treatments resulted in
the enrichment of r-Cs in the incineration residues. In our previous
survey on the concentration of r-Cs in the waste incineration residues
from several waste treatment plants in northeastern Japan,9 enrichment of r-Cs in the residues was found
in all plants. The enrichment level of r-Cs was not the same among
the plants, and the reason can be ascribed to the differences in the
furnace temperatures, waste composition, facility systems, or other
unknown factors.

There have been several studies intended to
identify the chemical
forms of r-Cs in waste incineration residues. One study characterized
the chemical forms of stable (nonradioactive) Cs in MSW and SS incineration
fly ash (FA),10 and other studies conducted
incineration tests for municipal solid waste with the addition of
Cs2CO3 reagent to determine the chemical forms
of Cs in the ash.11,12 The leaching behavior of r-Cs
and stable Cs from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash9,13−16 and sewage sludge incineration (SSI) ash13,14,17−21 and the distribution ratios of r-Cs9 and stable Cs22 between the
bottom ash (BA) and fly ash of MSW were also reported. Current knowledge
on the behavior of r-Cs or stable Cs in MSWI and SSI is as follows:
more than half of the r-Cs9 and stable
Cs22 in MSW were distributed to fly ash
(MSWI-FA) in stoker incineration plants. The chemical form of Cs in
MSWI-FA was identified as mostly chlorides9,10,12,16 or at least
water-soluble forms.13−16 According to the analyses of the residues of co-incineration of
MSW and Cs2CO3 reagent,11,12 Cs in the MSW bottom ash (MSWI-BA) was mostly glassy materials or
metal sulfides or crystalline aluminosilicates such as pollucite,
except for the unchanged reagents. The percentages of water-soluble
fractions of r-Cs of MSWI-FA were all in the range of approximately
60–90%,9,13−16 while those of the BA were less
than several percentages.9,13,14 In sewage sludge incineration (SSI) using a fluidized-bed incinerator,
r-Cs in the SSI-fly ash (SSI-FA) was mostly water-insoluble.13,14,17−21 The chemical forms of r-Cs in the SSI-FA have not
yet been directly determined, but are suggested as aluminosilicate10 or part of the oxides including iron.19 Some studies have reported that in highly alkaline
solution (pH > 12)18 or in acidic solutions,17,19 leachability of the
r-Cs from the SSI-FA increased greatly. In a sequential leaching test
on MSWI-BA, MSWI-FA, and SSI-FA, the leaching behaviors of r-Cs and
Cs from the same ash samples were similar,14 suggesting that the chemical forms of r-Cs and stable Cs in that
ash probably resembled each other.

Regarding the chemical forms
of r-Cs in the municipal wastes before
incineration, there is little available literature. Some of the r-Cs
in MSW might come from the soil, dust, or vegetation such as yard
trimmings because such materials in northeastern Japan had adsorbed
r-Cs species. SS is composed of sewage and sediment in the sewer systems;
thus, some of the r-Cs in SS should come from the sediment of sewer
systems. According to the literature, heating of Cs-doped bentonite23 or Cs-doped soil24,25 at 1000 °C
leads to the formation of crystalline aluminosilicate such as pollucite
(CsAlSi2O6). It is probable that some of the
Cs in MSW and SS are also transformed into crystalline aluminosilicate
by incineration.

To further understand the behavior of Cs in
incinerators and to
identify the chemical forms of Cs species in the ash, theoretical
approaches such as thermodynamic equilibrium calculation would be
appropriate to complement the lacking information. Thermodynamic equilibrium
calculations have been employed to examine the fate of alkali species
in incinerators26−31 as well as to predict the chemical forms of radioactive species
in thermal treatments for radioactive wastes.32,33 Although complete representation of all processes occurring in incineration
facilities remains a challenge for any theoretical approach, thermodynamic
equilibrium calculation has an advantage in that it can evaluate the
possible chemical changes in a system that includes many components,
such as in an MSW incinerator or an SS incinerator, and therefore
it fits in evaluating the behavior of r-Cs in incineration plants.

In the present study, we performed thermodynamic equilibrium calculations
to estimate the fate of Cs in MSWI and SSI at temperatures from 800
to 1200 °C and an air ratio of 1.5. To calculate the behavior
of Cs, we collected thermodynamic data for several Cs species from
the literature, estimated some lacking thermodynamic properties, and
compiled them into a new thermodynamic database for Cs species. This
modification was necessary because commercial databases did not include
the data for Cs species relevant to our study. The accuracy of the
database was checked by comparing the calculated phase equilibrium
properties for simple systems with the known phase equilibrium data.
To check the validity of applying thermodynamic equilibrium calculation
to waste incineration systems, we first compared the calculated equilibrium
product compositions with the known information for incineration residues
and then discussed the possible chemical forms of Cs in each waste
incineration system. The effects of temperature and waste composition
on the fate of Cs were also examined.

Method
2.1 Composition of Wastes
Four MSW samples,
two refuse-derived fuel (RDF) samples, and three SS samples were collected
from incineration facilities, and proximate and ultimate analyses
were performed. RDF samples were produced from MSW using slaked lime
as a binder. Among the three SS samples, one sample (SS3) was dewatered
sewage sludge that included slaked lime as a flocculant and had a
large amount of Ca. For several of the samples, the concentration
of either P or B or both was not measured because they were usually
small, and the lacking information was complemented by citing values
from the literature or waste composition databases.34,35 The elemental compositions are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Setup for the Equilibrium Calculation
Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed using commercial
software, FactSage version 7.0 (GTT Technologies).36 All calculations were performed for the systems at 1 atm,
in the temperature range of 800–1200 °C, and with the
initial constituent of 100 g of waste and the corresponding air (21%
O2, 89% N2) at an air ratio of 1.5. Air ratio
is the ratio of the actual amount of air to the least required amount
of air for complete combustion, and is defined by eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  where FO2_actual refers to the actual amount of O2 fed to
the furnace; FO2_theoretical refers to the least required amount of O2 for complete
combustion of the waste, both in units of mN3 h–1; Fwaste refers
to the amount of waste fed (kg h–1); cC, cS, cH, and cO refer to the molar amount
of C, S, H, and O atoms, respectively, per 1 kg of the waste (mol
kg–1); and VO2 refers to the normal molar volume of O2 = 0.0224 mN3 mol–1. The air ratio is the
same as the equivalence ratio. The air ratio of a stoker furnace is
usually 1.3–2.0,37 and we employed
1.5 as a typical value. The corresponding amounts of air per 100 g
of waste are listed in Table 1.

The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed
using the concentrations of stable Cs because stable Cs was much more
abundant than r-Cs. The origin of the stable Cs in MSW and SS is unknown,
but is probably from soil and vegetation in the case of MSW and from
sediment in the case of SS. Most of the stable Cs was not the product
of the accident of FDNPP because the concentration of stable Cs before22,34,35 and after the accident (Table 1 of this study) was
of the same order of magnitude.

2.3 Thermodynamic
Data
All pure compounds
and selected molten oxide and salt solutions from the FactPS, FToxid,
and FTsalt databases were included in the calculations. In the case
of Cs species for which the thermodynamic data was not provided in
the databases of the software, such as Cs silicates and aluminosilicates,
and in the case of species for which the thermodynamic data was included
in the original database but more recent data or parameters were available,
such as for Cs oxides, the thermodynamic parameters were updated by
taking the parameters from the literature38−43 or by estimating them using an empirical equation for heat capacities44,45 together with the melting temperatures46−48 or from a theoretical
formula for ideal gases49,50 together with the molecular
constants for each species51−53 and the thermodynamic data of
the constituent elements.54 We compiled
the updated data in a new database. We assumed that pollucite (CsAlSi2O6) forms an ideal solid solution with leucite
(KAlSi2O6) because the two minerals form a single-phase
crystalline solid through hydrothermal synthesis55 or calcination.56,57 We also assumed that
CsAlSiO4 and KAlSiO4 also form a solid solution
at high temperatures. Table 2 lists the selected databases of FactSage 7.0, and Table 3 summarizes the estimated
thermodynamic properties of Cs compounds. Details about the estimation
are provided in the Supporting Information. The accuracy of our dataset and its consistency with the commercial
databases were checked by comparing the calculated phase equilibrium
properties with the known phase equilibrium data.

a Standard conditions are 298.15 K

temperatures used in the calculation were taken from the literature:
2023 K for CsAlSiO4,46 2173
K for CsAlSi2O6,47 and 1693 K for CsAlSi5O12.48 The heat capacity at 298.2 K (Cp,298) of CsAlSi2O6 was reported in the literature
(173.2 J mol–1 K–1)39,40 and the corresponding values for CsAlSiO4 and CsAlSi5O12 were estimated to be 121.9 and 299.6 J mol–1 K–1 respectively, from the Neumann–Kopp
rule (simple stoichiometric summation of the Cp,298 values of Cs2O, Al2O3, SiO2).

shifted the estimated standard
enthalpy of CsAlSiO4 (−2121 by Lindemer41 and −2133 kJ mol−1 by
Taylor42) and CsAlSi5O12 by Lindemer41 (−5805 kJ mol−1) to better reproduce the melting temperatures, as
well as to obtain the plausible high temperature behaviors of Cs.

d Cp,
ΔfH°, and S° for gases were estimated using the statistical equations in
ref (49) or (50), and the details are presented
in the Supporting Information. The thermodynamic
properties for elemental Cs, O atom, and O2 molecule were
cited from the NIST database.54 The calculated Cp values from room temperature to 2300 K were
fitted by a polynomial function of temperature to determine the coefficients
of the function.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Performance Evaluation
of Thermodynamic Database
for Cs Species
3.1.1 Phase Diagrams for Cs–O,
Cs2O–SiO2, and Cs2O–Al2O3–SiO2 Systems
Figure S2 in the Supporting Information shows
an estimated phase diagram for the Cs–O system using literature
data43 and the estimated thermodynamic
data for gas species listed in Table 3. The calculated phase diagram reproduced the phase
diagram reported by Guéneau and Flèche in 2015.43Figure S3 shows an
estimated phase diagram for the Cs2O–SiO2 system using literature data38 together
with the assumption that the liquid silicate phase was an ideal solution
of liquid Cs2SiO3, Cs2Si2O5, Cs2Si4O9,38 and liquid silica. The calculated phase diagram
was similar to the phase diagram reported by Kim et al.,58 which included measured and calculated solid–liquid
phase equilibria.

Figure S1 compares
the estimated heat capacities for solid cesium aluminosilicates with
the experimental heat capacities for alkali aluminosilicates. Cesium
aluminosilicates reported in the literature are CsAlSiO4,46,59 CsAlSi2O6,39,47,60,61 CsAlSi5O12,48,60 and Cs0.35Al0.35Si2.65O6.62 Because the heat capacities for cesium aluminosilicates
up to high temperatures were not found in the literature, we estimated
the values. In Figure S1, the experimental
heat capacities of MAlSiO4 and MAlSi2O6 (M = alkali metal)63−66 were almost the same, and the estimated heat capacities of cesium
aluminosilicates were also on the curves of the experimental aluminosilicates.

Figure S4 shows an estimated phase diagram
for the CsAlSiO4–SiO2 system using the
estimated heat capacities and standard state thermodynamic data listed
in Table 3, together
with additionally estimated thermodynamic data for liquid CsAlO2. Details about the calculation are provided in the Supporting Information. The correlation with
literature information (melting points) was poor. Because the phase
diagram varied greatly by adjusting the activity coefficient of the
liquid components, for further quantitative modeling, improvement
of the solution model of liquid cesium aluminosilicates is required.
However, in the present study, as we deal with systems with trace
amounts of Cs, it may not be necessary to assess the thermodynamic
data for the whole Cs2O–Al2O–SiO2 system: it may be rather more important to have satisfactorily
accurate activity coefficients for trace amount of Cs species in liquid
aluminosilicates. It should be also noted that because the phase diagram
also varied by the selection of thermodynamic parameters of the cesium
aluminosilicates, if more reliable data are available, the parameters
should be updated.

3.1.2 Gas-Phase Speciation
and Vapor Pressures
under the Reported Conditions
Since the latest reviews on
the thermodynamic data of gaseous cesium species by Lamoreaux and
Hildenbrand in 198453 and Cordfunke and
Konings in 1990,67 new molecular constants
based on quantum chemical calculations have been reported. We estimated
the thermodynamic data of the gas species of Cs oxides using the updated
molecular parameters in Table S1.

Table S2 summarizes the calculated gas-phase
speciation and equilibrium pressures of several Cs species under different
conditions, together with the corresponding literature information.
Details of each calculation are shown in Figures S5-1–7 in the Supporting Information. The calculated
gas-phase speciations thoroughly matched the reported speciations,
and the calculated equilibrium pressures for various species were
almost the same order of magnitude as the reported values, except
in the case of silicates and aluminosilicates. For liquid cesium silicates,
it was difficult to reproduce the volatility of Cs above the liquid
phase by assuming that liquid was the ideal solution of cesium silicates
and liquid silica. Again, the importance of setting adequate activity
coefficients of Cs species in the molten silicates was indicated.

3.1.3 Leachability of Cs from Cesium Aluminosilicates
The leachability of cesium aluminosilicates has been reported,68,69 and we compared the estimated and reported leachability using the
estimated thermodynamic parameters and the aqueous solution database
(FThelg-AQID) of FactSage 7.0. The results are summarized in Figure S6. The estimated leachability of CsAlSiO4 was almost the same as the reported value.68 Due to the difference in conditions, it was difficult to
check the accuracy of the calculated leachability for other aluminosilicates.
The order of leachability was CsAlSiO4 > CsAlSi2O6 > CsAlSi5O12, which
agreed with
the reported characteristics.69

3.1.4 Remarks on the Performance of the Database
for Cs Species
As noted above, the gas-phase species were
well described and the gas-to-condensed phase partitioning could be
calculated, although the quantitative estimation was not very much
accurate for the liquid silicate and aluminosilicate systems. In the
latter part of this study, we obtained the results of applying the
thermodynamic equilibrium calculation to waste incineration systems,
and at those calculations, for improved fate estimation for Cs species,
we estimated the activity coefficients of Cs2O and CsCl
in the molten aluminosilicate phase (FToxid-slagH) from that of K2O and KCl, as described in Table 2. For this purpose, we repeated the equilibrium
calculations for each system: the first calculation was performed
to obtain the temperature function of the activity coefficient of
K2O and KCl in the slag phase, and the second calculation
was performed to estimate the behavior of Cs in the same systems.

3.2 Estimated Chemical form of Cs in MSW Incineration
Ash
In this section and the next section, we first compared
the calculated mineralogical composition of the major component of
incineration residues to that reported in the literature. The purpose
of this was to check the accuracy of applying thermodynamic equilibrium
calculation to waste incineration systems. Then, we analyzed the behavior
of Cs, together with that of other alkali species. Comparing the behaviors
of Cs and other alkali metals makes the discussion more reliable because
all alkali species basically behave similarly, and the thermodynamic
data of Na and K are more reliable than those of Cs due to the abundance
of the literature. The estimated behavior of Cs was compared to the
reported behaviors.

Figure 1 shows the calculated equilibrium compositions of the
MSWI products for selected MSW samples at 850 and 1100 °C. The
rest of the results are indicated in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. The temperature of a stoker furnace
is usually between these two temperatures. At 850 °C, the chief
equilibrium products were melilite, feldspar, wollastonite, larnite,
hematite, and gaseous alkali chloride. At 1100 °C, molten aluminosilicates
formed, the fractions of gaseous species increased, and the amount
of crystalline aluminosilicate decreased. The estimated mineralogical
composition of the bottom ash (BA) was thus the minerals described
above plus amorphous aluminosilicates formed by cooling the molten
aluminosilicates, whereas the estimated composition of the fly ash
(FA) was solid alkali chlorides and the components of fine BA entrained
from the furnace into flue gas. These estimated compositions were
consistent with the actual composition of BA70−75 and FA,76,77 except that the actual BA includes quartz
and lime, although they were not equilibrium products in our calculation.
The latter disagreement is probably because some of the quartz in
the BA was not an incineration product but refractory material originally
included in the waste, as has been pointed out by earlier studies.74,75 For more realistic calculations, therefore, it may be necessary
to remove the contribution of such refractory materials from the input
elemental composition of the equilibrium calculation.

Figure 1 Main components of calculated
equilibrium products from the incineration
of RDF2 and MSW1. The letters (g), (s), and (SLAG) in the legends
indicate that the species are pure gas-phase species, pure solids,
or a species in the molten slag, respectively. The letters (SPINA),
(Mel_A), and (WOLLA) indicate that the species are part of solid solutions
of spinel, melilite, and wollastonite, respectively. The vertical
axis in each bar graph represents the amount of species in mol per
100 g of waste (wet base).

Figures 2 and S8 show the equilibrium speciation of alkali
metals from 800 to 1200 °C. Na and K were transformed into crystalline
aluminosilicates, molten slag phases, and gaseous chlorides. The fractions
of gas species for Na and K metals were 0–40 and 15–100%,
respectively. These are consistent with the reported distribution
ratios of alkali metals to FA,22 as well
as the high leachability of Na and K from MSW-FA and low values from
MSW-BA.13 It appears acceptable to use
thermodynamic equilibrium calculation to estimate the fate of alkali
species.

Figure 2 Calculated equilibrium products of alkali species generated from
the incineration of RDF2 and MSW1. The letters (g), (s), (ss), (KNSO),
and (SLAG) in the legends indicate that the species are pure gas-phase
species, pure solids, part of a solid solution of the pollucite–leucite
system, part of a solid solution of sulfate, or a species in the molten
slag, respectively.

For Cs, although most
of the additionally included thermodynamic
parameters for Cs compounds were estimations, the behavior of Cs was
similar to that of Na and K: At lower temperatures, the equilibrium
products were gaseous CsCl and a crystalline aluminosilicate such
as a solid solution of pollucite (CsAlSi2O6)
and leucite (KAlSi2O6). Fractions of the gas
species increased with the elevation in temperature. Furthermore,
a portion of the Cs species dissolved in the slag phase (molten aluminosilicate
phase) in the calculation of MSW2. This was almost the same speciation
and temperature change as that observed for other alkali species.
This is consistent with the observation of an earlier paper22 that the distribution behavior of Cs between
BA and FA was similar to that of other alkali metals.

In Table 4, we summarized
the behavior of Cs for a comparison with the reported behavior. The
distribution ratio to FA was calculated using eq 3, and leachability was evaluated from eq 4. 3   4  In eq 3, we assumed
that all gas species and 15% of the solid and
liquid species in the incinerator are transferred to the flue gas
cooling sections and become FA, and the remaining 85% of the solid
and liquid components become BA. The value of 15% is a typical entrainment
ratio for a stoker incinerator. In eq 4, we assumed that all gaseous cesium salts condense
to water-soluble salts after flue-gas cooling. The estimated Cs speciation
was crystalline aluminosilicates and amorphous aluminosilicates for
BA, and that of FA was solid chloride and the same components of BA.
The leachability of Cs from BA was estimated to be low because the
solubility or the leaching rate of Cs from both Cs aluminosilicates68,69 and glassy materials such as slag from MSW melting facilities9 were all small values. The leachability of Cs
from FA was estimated to be high because cesium salts such as CsCl
have high water solubility. This is consistent with the actual leaching
behavior summarized in Section 1. The calculation also suggested that a larger amount of Cs
will be converted to CsCl gas at higher temperatures, and this is
consistent with the observed higher distribution ratios of r-Cs to
FA in the waste treatment facilities with higher furnace temperatures.9

Note that
among the equilibrium products, crystalline Cs aluminosilicates
and cesium species in the molten slag phase were both newly included
species in our database. When we did not include these compounds in
the equilibrium calculations, the resulting equilibrium product under
incineration conditions was always CsCl gas, i.e., all Cs was estimated
to become CsCl gas. This could not explain the reported distribution
ratios of r-Cs to FA. Hence, the present success suggests that to
estimate the high-temperature behavior of Cs, it is important to include
the thermodynamic data of all possible products, especially solid
components. Note also that in our calculation, pollucite–leucite
solid solution was found to be the main Cs-containing aluminosilicate
mineral when leucite was present, but pure pollucite crystal was not
an equilibrium product in the calculations for MSWI. In actuality,
there may be more minerals other than leucite, in which Cs might be
incorporated as a constituent or impurity, but due to a lack of thermodynamic
data, we could not evaluate the amount of Cs in such other minerals.

Among the gas-phase species, neither elemental Cs nor cesium oxides
were the equilibrium products under our calculation conditions. This
is because under the incineration conditions of MSW where there was
enough hydrogen chloride, the equilibrium shifted to yield CsCl in
the gas phase. In Figure S9 of the Supporting
Information, we show a diagram displaying the most stable gaseous
Cs species at 1000 °C and the given HCl and H2O partial
pressures. This figure was calculated from our Cs database using FactSage
7.0, for a better understanding of the thermodynamic stability among
gaseous Cs species. As the HCl concentration in flue gas before flue
gas cleaning treatment is usually several hundred ppm, CsCl gas is
predominant among the gas species.

3.3 Estimated
Chemical Form of Cs in Sewage Sludge
Incineration Ash
Figure 3 shows the calculated equilibrium products of sewage
sludge at 850 and 1100 °C. In sewage sludge incineration (SSI)
with fluidized-bed combustors (FBCs), the incineration temperatures
are normally set at around 800–900 °C and thus the calculations
for 850 °C are close to the actual FBC incineration conditions.
The equilibrium products of sewage sludge (SS1 and SS2) at 850 °C
were quartz, calcium and magnesium phosphates, hematite, and feldspars.
Gas species were of negligibly small amounts, and thus, the estimated
SSI-FA compositions were the same as the composition of the solid
equilibrium products. The estimated compositions listed above are
similar to the compositions of SSI ash reported in the literature.78,79

Figure 3 Main
components of equilibrium products generated from sewage sludge
incineration. The letters (g), (s), (s#) (where # = 2, 3, and 4),
and (SLAG) in the legends indicate that the species are pure gas-phase
species, pure solids, or a species in the molten slag, respectively.
(SPINA), (Mel_A), (CMPc), and (C3Pb) indicate that the species are
part of solid solutions of spinel, melilite, phosphate, and other
phosphate, respectively. The vertical axis represents the number of
species in mol per 100 g of waste (wet base).

Figure 4 shows
the
equilibrium speciation of alkali metals in SSI. In the case of SS
that did not include slaked lime (SS1 and SS2), the equilibrium products
of alkali species at 850 °C were mostly solid aluminosilicates.
In some cases, Na,Ca-phosphate double salts were also included, and
this is consistent with an earlier study80 that detected potassium phosphates in SSI ash. Gaseous alkali species
(Na, K) were of negligibly small amounts, and this is consistent with
the reported low leaching rates of alkali metals from sewage sludge
fly ash.13,14,17−21

Figure 4 Calculated
equilibrium products of alkali species generated from
sewage sludge incineration. The letters (g), (s), (ss), and (SLAG)
in the legends indicate that the species are pure gas-phase species,
pure solids, part of a solid-solution of pollucite–leucite
system, and a species in the molten slag, respectively.

Cs in SSI behaved similarly to Na and K. At lower
temperatures,
almost all Cs was solid aluminosilicate in SS1 and SS2. However, from
the similarity of Cs and other alkali metals, Cs is expected to be
incorporated into whitlockite or other phosphates, too, because Cs
and calcium are known to form a range of phosphate double salts, such
as Cs2CaP2O781 and CsCa10(PO4).82 Although the solubility of the (Cs,Ca)-phosphate double salts was
not found in the literature, based on the low solubility of calcium
orthophosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) in water,83 it is inferred that the solubility of Cs-whitlockite
is also low. As a summary, both Cs aluminosilicates and Cs-whitlockite
are plausible chemical forms of Cs in SSI-FA. Table 5 summarizes the calculated and reported behavior
of Cs for SSI. The leachability of individual incineration residues
was evaluated using eq 4.

a The calculations were performed
at 850 °C.

At higher
temperatures, approximately half of the Cs was gas species
in our calculation, whereas Na and K were dissolved into molten aluminosilicates.
This seems strange because from the analogy of Cs and other alkali
species, it would be plausible for Cs to also dissolve into the molten
aluminosilicate at higher temperatures. Because the activity coefficients
of Cs in molten aluminosilicates used in the present calculations
were estimations (see Table 2 and the footnote for details), the difference in the high-temperature
behavior of Cs and other alkali species may come from the incompleteness
of the activity coefficient values of Cs species in the molten aluminosilicates.

In the case of dewatered sewage sludge using slaked lime as a flocculant
(SS3), the main equilibrium products included calcium aluminosilicates,
melilites, and spinels, and they were different from those of SS1
and SS2. The largest difference was that almost all of the alkali
species were gaseous chlorides, according to the equilibrium calculations.
From the calculations, the incineration of SS3 was estimated to generate
fly ash with a higher leachability of r-Cs, although the actual leaching
rate of r-Cs in a survey report was less than several percentages,
even in the case where the sewage sludge included a lime flocculant.21

One possible mechanism that could account
for this discrepancy
is that because the FBC included a large amount of sand, the alkali
species may have reacted with the sand. This possibility may be supported
by one of our previous studies in which the addition of colloidal
silica or bentonite in biomass heated up to 500–850 °C
reduced the volatilization of r-Cs.84 We
calculated the equilibrium products for a mixture of SS3 and fluidized
sand, with the mass ratio of SS and sand set at 1:500. This mass ratio
was calculated from the literature data for typical fluidized-bed
combustor conditions (feeding of dry solid = 1000 lb h–1 and sand volume = 5000 lb),85 assuming
the residence time of sludge as 10 s. We also assumed that the sand
in the FBC was composed of 98 wt % silica and 2 wt % alumina. In Figure 4 and Table 5, the result of this calculation
is indicated as SS3 + sand. At 850 °C, almost all of the Na and
K and most of the Cs were calculated to be water-insoluble crystalline
aluminosilicates. This was consistent with the actual leaching rate
of alkali species. In fact, the elemental composition of the sand
in an SS incinerator after 1 month’s operation differed significantly
from that of unused sand,86 and in some
articles on biomass combustion using a silica sand fluidized-bed reactor,
even the surface of the silica sand was changed by the alkali species.87,88 This may support the possibility of reactions between the sand and
alkali or alkaline-earth species. We also conducted similar calculations
for SS1 and SS2, and in those systems, the presence of sand did not
affect the chemical forms of alkali species at normal incineration
temperatures. In short, the equilibrium calculations for the SS +
sand systems and other literature data suggest that the treatment
using a fluidized-bed combustor may induce Cs to form water-insoluble
minerals, even in the case of sewage sludge dewatered by lime. From
the viewpoint of safety, an abundance of sand, such as that inside
the FBC, may be important for SSI to protect against secondary contamination
due to the leaching of r-Cs from SSI residues.

Another possible
mechanism is that because SSI was conducted in
a fluidized-bed combustor, the residence time of the sludge was not
long enough to complete the ash-forming reactions. In SSI, sediments
in the sewage sludge may first form amorphous aluminosilicates capturing
the adsorbed species such as Cs, and then slow solid-state reactions
of the amorphous aluminosilicates and other components may proceed.
In this scheme, Cs-containing amorphous aluminosilicates may not have
enough time to react with other species and the chemical form of Cs
in the SSI-FA will thus be amorphous aluminosilicates.

For a
more detailed discussion, it is necessary to investigate
whether the above kinetic-controlled phenomena contribute to the behavior
of alkali species.

3.4 Effect of Waste Composition
on the Fate of
Cs
In this and the next section, we focus on the behavior
of Cs. First, we examine the possible effect of waste elemental composition
on the fate of Cs. In MSW and RDF incineration systems (Figures 1, 2, S7, and S8), in the case of MSW1, MSW2,
and MSW4, where the Ca/Si molar ratios (calculated from Table 1) were close to or smaller than
1, the fractions of gaseous alkali chlorides were relatively small
and those of solid or molten aluminosilicates were large, whereas
in the case of RDF1, RDF2, and MSW3, in which the Ca/Si ratios were
close to 2, the Cs at furnace temperatures was mostly gas species.
Here, Ca/Si ratios appeared to be important in the vaporization of
Cs. This is probably because Ca consumes Si and Al, preventing the
formation of cesium aluminosilicates, and/or because the activity
coefficients of Cs species (and K species) in the molten slag phase
were larger in Ca-rich molten aluminosilicate than in Si-rich phases,
and the Cs species dissolved in Ca-rich slag are less stable than
those in Si-rich phases. The former mechanism may be evaluated by
using the thermodynamic data: One possible effect of Ca was the exchange
of metals via the following reactions: 5   6  Here, the
compounds with (g) refer to the
gas species and others refer to the most stable phase of each compound
at the calculation temperatures. The standard Gibbs energies of the
reactions calculated using the FactSage thermodynamic data and our
data are summarized in Figure 5. The standard Gibbs energies of eqs 5 and 6 were positive
and decreased with the temperature. The fraction of the equilibrium
pressures calculated from the Gibbs energy of eq 5 was (pCsOH/bar)(pH2O/bar)0.5 = 9 ×
10–7 at 1000 °C. From the compositions and
air amounts in Table 1, the maximum pressures of Cs species in the waste incinerators were
calculated to be 2 × 10–9–2 × 10–8 atm. As the maximum pressures of water vapor were
calculated to be 0.1–0.2 atm under the same conditions, the
equilibrium pressures of CsOH were 3 × 10–7–4 × 10–7 atm, which were larger than
the maximum pressure of the Cs species. Similarly, from the Gibbs
energy of eq 6, the equilibrium
CsCl pressure was 0.004 atm, which was larger than the maximum pressures
of the Cs species. These results mean that even though pollucite was
generated, if there was lime (CaO) or CaCl2 adjacent to
the pollucite in a humid incineration atmosphere, the pollucite would
decompose and gaseous Cs species would be generated in our incinerator
conditions. For the two Ca compounds, the effect of Cs vaporization
was larger for CaCl2 than CaO with water vapor.

Figure 5 Standard molar
Gibbs energy of reaction eqs 5–17 plotted against
temperature.

As MSW includes alkali
metals, its effect was also examined. Possible
alkali metal exchange reactions are as follows: 7   8   9   10  The Gibbs energies of eqs 7–10 were positive
but small (Figure 5). The ratio of the equilibrium pressures, pCsOH/pKOH and pCsOH/pNaOH, were both 0.4
at 1000 °C in eqs 7 and 8, respectively, and pCsCl/pKCl and pCsCl/pNaCl were 0.4 and 0.3
at 1000 °C in eqs 9 and 10, respectively. Because the maximum
Na and K pressures estimated from the data in Table 1 were 1 × 10–5 and
1 × 10–4 atm, respectively, the corresponding
equilibrium pressures of Cs species in eqs 7–10 were 10−6 to 10−5 atm, which were all larger
than the maximum pressures of the Cs species. This means that if the
waste included a sufficient amount of Cl, and sylvite or halite were
found in the MSW-FA, which suggests that gaseous KCl or NaCl had been
formed in the incinerator, then CsCl should have been formed with pCsCl/pKCl or pCsCl/pNaCl equal
to or smaller than 0.4 or 0.3, respectively, until the reactions reached
equilibria or all Cs became CsCl . The amount of Cl in the RDF and
MSW was usually high. The ratio of the amount of Cl to the summed
amount of all alkali metals was 0.9–2.0. Typical NaCl and KCl
partial pressures for the RDFI and MSWI calculated from the equilibrium
calculations were 10−5 to 10−4 atm at 1000 °C, which was large enough to make most of the
Cs as gaseous CsCl. Even though Cl was not present, if there was KOH
or NaOH in the furnace, then CsOH should have also been formed. Gaseous
alkali species act to increase the amount of gaseous Cs species.

The calculated effect of the elemental composition of sewage sludge
was as follows: In the case of sewage sludge that did not include
slaked lime (SS1 and SS2) in Figures 3 and 4, which were rich in P
and lean in Ca and Cl, the fraction of gaseous alkali chlorides was
negligibly small and most of the alkali species were calculated to
be crystalline or molten aluminosilicates (or phosphates). In dewatered
sewage sludge that include slaked lime (SS3), although almost all
of the alkali metals were predicted to become gaseous chlorides when
the calculation was performed without including the silica sand (SS3
in Figure 4), as shown
in the last column of Figure 4 (SS3 + sand), the presence of fluidized sand led to the formation
of a water-insoluble Cs compound. Furthermore, a comparison of SS2
and MSW2 shows that although the Ca/Si ratios were almost the same
(0.76 g g–1 for SS2 and 0.63 g g–1 for MSW2), the fraction of gaseous alkali chlorides was significantly
larger in MSW2 than in SS2. This is probably because SS2 was richer
in P and leaner in Cl than MSW2. In the Cl-lean, P-rich environment
surrounded by sand, the following reactions had negative Gibbs energies
(Figure 5) 11   12  The equilibrium pressure of CsOH in eq 12 was 1 × 10–11 atm
at 1000 °C, which was much smaller than
the maximum pressure of Cs species. "Remaining Cs may be converted
into CsAlSi5O12. In eq 11, the product included gaseous phosphorus
oxide, but in actuality, metals in the sludge would react to yield
phosphates. The reaction Gibbs energy of eq 11 combined with the phosphate formation reactions
had more negative value and lead to CsAlSi5O12 formation. CsAlSi5O12 will be formed if both
AlPO4 and SiO2 exist.

To compare the thermodynamic
stability of calcium phosphates and
calcium aluminosilicates, we plotted the standard Gibbs energies of
a reactions that generate calcium phosphate from calcium silicate
(Figure 5) 13   14  The Gibbs energies of eqs 13 and 14 were
negative,
and the calcium phosphate (whitlockite) was more stable than the aluminosilicate
(anorthite). Therefore, it is inferred that in a P-rich waste, P consumes
Ca from the system and inhibits the formation of calcium aluminosilicates;
thus, alkali metals can approach more Al and Si, which act to increase
the amount of alkali aluminosilicate.

Meanwhile, Cl in MSW can
be a source of metal chlorides, thus acting
to enhance the vaporization of alkali metals as gaseous alkali chloride.
The effect of Cl was simply examined from the Gibbs energy of the
reactions of cesium aluminosilicates and hydrogen chloride 15   16   17  The standard Gibbs energies of the reactions
were positive and decreased with the temperature. The equilibrium
pressures of CsCl (pCsCl) under a typical
incinerator condition for MSWI (1000 °C, pH2O = 0.1 atm and pHCl = 100 ppm)
were estimated as 6 × 10–6, 3 × 10–7, and 7 × 10–9 atm for eqs 15, 16, and 17, respectively. Because the maximum
pressures of Cs species were 2 × 10−9 –2
× 10−8 atm, eqs 15–17 would proceed until
all of the Cs became CsCl gas. This means that the cesium aluminosilicates
dealt with in this study were not stable in an incineration atmosphere
containing sufficient amount of hydrogen chloride. For SSI condition
(850 °C, pH2O = 0.5 atm
and pHCl = 70 ppm), the equilibrium CsCl
pressures for eqs 15–17 were 9 × 10−7, 5 × 10−8, and 1 × 10−9 atm, respectively. CsAlSiO4 and pollucite would decompose
while some of CsAlSi5O12 would remain unchanged.
In actuality, HCl was also consumed by other alkali species, and the
reactions with HCl (eqs 15–17) and with alkali chloride (eqs 9 and 10) competitively occur. As described previously, the ratio
of amount of Cl to the amount of sum of all alkali metals was higher
than 0.9 for RDF, MSW and SS3, but lower than 0.09 for SS1 and SS2.
In the case of SS1 and SS2, even though the reactions reached equilibria,
the fraction CsCl(g) to the total Cs was low. In other words, the
presence of sufficient amount of Cl enhances the vaporization of Cs
and the product is CsCl. This is consistent with some literature that
reports on the effect of Cl on the vaporization of r-Cs in various
systems.89,90

By combining all results on the effect
of the composition of the
waste, it is suggested that the Ca/Si ratio, Cl content, and P content
of waste are all important in considering the partitioning of Cs into
fly ash and the water-leaching ratios of the Cs species from the fly
ash.

3.5 Thermodynamic Stability among Cesium Aluminosilicates
In our calculations, pollucite was a stable phase in MSWI, and
CsAlSi5O12 was formed in SSI. In actuality,
in a previous study of heating of bentonite adsorbed by Cs and other
mineral reagents, CsAlSiO4 was detected.23 In another study, when soil with the addition of Cs2CO3 reagent was heated up to 800–1200 °C,
CsAlSiO4 and pollucite were detected.25 In those systems, SiO2 or feldspar was not detected
after high-temperature treatments, suggesting that they were all consumed.
This last section focuses on the thermodynamic stability among cesium
aluminosilicates when they are surrounded by other minerals. The stability
can be evaluated by examining the following reactions (Figure 6) 18   19   20   21   22  All reactions except for eq 19 had negative Gibbs energy,
suggesting
that pollucite can be formed if CsAlSiO4 is adjacent to
feldspar or quartz. The effect of transforming CsAlSiO4 to pollucite was larger for K-feldspar than for other feldspar minerals.

Figure 6 Standard
molar Gibbs energy of reaction eqs 19–26 plotted
against temperature.

Regarding CsAlSi5O12, the following
reactions
were examined 23   24   25   26   27  The Gibbs energies were negative when the
reaction included SiO2 or feldspar. Therefore, CsAlSi5O12 can be formed when pollucite is adjacent to
SiO2 or feldspars. The effect was especially large for
K-feldspar among other feldspar minerals. However, eqs 20 and 25 may
be affected by the formation of pollucite−leucite solid solution.
Also note that although eqs 21, 22, 26 and 27 had negative Gibbs energies, the absolute values
were not so large, thus, from the uncertainty of the thermodynamic
parameters of the Cs species, the actual Gibbs energies might be positive
for those reactions. Taking into account those uncertainties, we conclude
that the possible form of cesium aluminosilicate is determined by
the amount of SiO2 or feldspar in the system; If SiO2 or feldspars (at least, K-feldspar) is present, the cesium
aluminosilicate can be converted into more Si-rich cesium aluminosilicate,
at least when the temperature was high enough to proceed the reaction.
This is consistent with the reported features that CsAlSiO4 was observed in the thermal treatment residues that did not include
SiO223,25 and that quartz and feldspar
as well as soil can convert the cesium to be water-insoluble species.24

4 Conclusions
In this
study, we applied thermodynamic equilibrium calculation
to MSWI and SSI that included Cs. To conduct the calculations, thermodynamic
data on Cs species were collected from the literature or estimated
and compiled in a new thermodynamic database. Using this database,
we successfully represented the actual distribution behavior of Cs
between the fly ash and bottom ash during MSW incineration in a stoker
furnace.

From the calculation results and taking into account
previous knowledge
on the behavior of alkali species in MSWI and SSI, the most probable
fate of radioactive cesium was estimated as follows: In MSWI, Cs was
converted into gaseous CsCl or aluminosilicate crystals or dissolved
into a molten slag phase in the incineration furnace. The fraction
of CsCl gas increased at high operating temperatures and large amounts
of Ca in the waste. On the other hand, aluminosilicate crystals or
phosphates were the most probable Cs species produced in SSI. The
difference in the behavior of Cs between MSWI and SSI was ascribed
to the difference in the elemental composition of MSW and SS, especially
the concentrations of P and Cl. In the present study, we also examined
the stability of solid cesium aluminosilicates and gas species via
several reactions using the standard Gibbs energies at high temperatures.
The calculated results helped us understand the effect of element
on the behavior of Cs.

For more advanced estimations, the following
points must be improved:
(1) the estimated thermodynamic parameters for important aluminosilicates
such as pollucite and CsAlSi5O12 should be replaced
by more precise values such as experimental values; (2) this study
dealt with incineration plants as a single box with uniform temperature
and pressure; however, because actual plants are composed of a furnace
with a low-temperature inlet and high-temperature combustion zones
as well as flue-gas cooling sections, a more realistic calculation
may be obtained by taking into account the temperature profiles in
the incineration plants; and (3) this calculation implicitly assumed
that all reactions and physical changes proceed completely and uniformly,
but as mentioned in Section 3, municipal solid waste includes refractory components such
as quartz, whereas in sewage sludge incineration, silica sand is also
present. In both cases, although not all of the quartz or other refractory
components inside the furnace contribute to the ash-forming reactions,
some of the refractory components such as the silica sand may partly
react with the components of the waste. By taking into account such
contributions in the equilibrium calculations, the results will be
more realistic.

In the viewpoint of using the database for systems
other than waste
incineration, qualitative estimation such as to examine the gas-phase
speciation will be reliable; however, quantitative estimation for
high-temperature systems including liquid silicate or aluminosilicate
remains uncertain because our thermodynamic data were not optimized
for such systems. For further application of the thermodynamic equilibrium
calculation to higher temperature systems such as ash-melting processes,
accurate activity coefficients of Cs species in molten aluminosilicate
are required. Thermodynamic assessment of cesium aluminosilicate systems
including liquid phase will be important, and for this purpose, reliable
experimental thermodynamic data are required.
