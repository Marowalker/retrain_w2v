The deep removal of fluorine from wet-process
phosphoric acid is currently a very serious issue. In this paper,
an efficient liquid–liquid separation method based on a bubble
membrane was developed to solve this problem. Tributyl phosphate (TBP)
and silicon oil (SIO) were used as the organic phase. The effects
of the component proportion in the organic phase (TBP/SIO v/v), organic
to aqueous phase ratio (O/A), pH, temperature, and reaction time on
the extraction ratio were investigated. The extraction ratio of fluorine
was 98.4% when using only one stage with the following conditions:
90 °C, pH −0.46, volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) of 7:3, phase
ratio (O/A) of 1:5, stirring speed of 200 rpm, and reaction time of
50 min. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and inverted fluorescence
microscopy were used to investigate the reaction mechanism and reaction
kinetics. In addition, the scrubbing and stripping process was investigated.
When a 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution ([NaOH]) was used as the
stripping agent with a phase ratio (O/A) of 1:10, a stirring speed
of 200 rpm, and a reaction time of 30 min, a maximum stripping ratio
of 90.1% was obtained.

1 Introduction
Because of the increasing demand
for phosphoric acid, Chinese factories produce more than 8 million
tons of phosphates every year. Currently, there are two primary methods
of manufacturing phosphoric acid: the thermal process, the product
of which is called thermal process phosphoric acid (TPA), and the
wet process, the product of which is called wet-process phosphoric
acid (WPA).1 Because of its advantages
over the thermal process of lower cost, lower energy consumption,
and reduced pollutant generation, the wet process is the preferred
method, and more than 90% of Chinese factories produce phosphoric
acid with this method.2−7 However, the main disadvantage of WPA is that during
its manufacturing process, there are many impurities present, among
which fluorine is one of the major impurities.8−10 Five main methods have been used to remove
fluorine from WPA. They are precipitation, steam stripping, cooling
and crystallization, vacuum concentration, and solvent extraction.11−13 Solvent extraction is among the
most popular method because of its low cost, high productivity, and
high recyclability.14−17

Historically, precipitation was the
most popular method for removing fluorine from WPA, and then steam
stripping and vacuum concentration took the place of precipitation,
as they were more effective in fluorine removal.18 Solvent extraction was used in certain countries, such
as the United States of America and Canada, before it was introduced
in China.19,20 Recently, there have been many reports investigating
the solvent extraction of fluorine from WPA. Hutchins, Lembrikov et
al., Amin et al., and Wang chose alcohol, phenol, amine, alkane, and
ether solvents as extractants to remove fluorine from WPA.6,9,21,22 Compared
to the phenol and alkane derivatives, the ether, amine, and alcohol
derivatives provided higher fluorine extraction rates, which could
reach 80–90% under the optimum conditions when using two- or
three-stage countercurrent extractions. To date, most reports on the
solvent extraction of fluorine from WPA, such as the report by Feki
et al., have investigated how to efficiently extract phosphoric acid
while indirectly extracting fluorine.23−26 However, few researchers
have investigated direct ways of separating fluorine from WPA. Moreover,
the methods that previous researchers used were complicated, expensive,
and inefficient. Developing a more efficient, less-expensive and simpler
method to solve these problems is thus necessary.

Hence, an
efficient extraction method based on a bubble membrane that meets
the above requirements is developed in this study, and it is substantially
different from conventional liquid–liquid extraction techniques.
Compared to conventional liquid–liquid extraction processes,
in which chemical reactions between the functional groups in the organic
phase and fluorine occur, this bubble membrane method mainly removes
fluorine by controlling the reaction conditions, such as the pH and
temperature, according to the physical characteristics of fluorine.
Finally, the fluorine ions in the form of small HF bubbles enter the
organic phase through the interfacial liquid membrane.27 Compared with other methods, this method offers
not only better separation efficiency but also broader applicability,
and it is particularly instructive.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Separation Reaction
2.1.1 Effects of pH and Temperature
Experiments
were carried out in a high-acidity and high-temperature environment.
The pH and temperature substantially affected the extraction ratio
of fluorine (% E), so they were the first influencing
factors to be investigated. First, pH levels ranging from 1.21 to
−2.1 were tested to investigate their impact on the % E. The pH was adjusted by adding 75% sulfuric acid (vol
%). The other reaction conditions were set as follows: temperature
of 50 °C, tributyl phosphine
(TBP) to silicon oil (SIO) volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) of 1:1, organic
phase to aqueous phase ratio (O/A) of 1:5, stirring speed of 200 rpm,
and reaction time of 1 h. Figure 1a shows that % E increased from 5.4
to 66.7% as the pH decreased and reached its maximum value of 66.7%
at a pH of −2.1. However, when the pH was less than −0.46,
the increases in % E became quite small, from 63.6
to 66.7%. The results suggest that a lower pH provides a better % E, and −0.46 was chosen as the reaction pH. These
results may be explained by the reaction of hydrogen ions with fluoride
ions to form HF and the combination of TBP with HF through hydrogen
bond formation, thereby causing the fluorine ions in the aqueous phase
to distribute into the organic phase.15

Figure 1 (a) Effects of pH and temperature on % E. (b) Effects of the volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) and phase
ratio (A/O) on % E.

Second, temperatures ranging from 15 to 100 °C were tested
to investigate their impact on the % E. The other
reaction conditions were set as follows: pH −0.46, volume ratio
(TBP/SIO v/v) of 1:1, phase ratio (O/A) of 1:5, stirring speed of
200 rpm, and reaction time of 1 h. As shown in Figure 1a, % E increased from 38.4
to 95.7% with increasing temperature and reached its maximum value
of 95.7% at 100 °C. However, when the temperature exceeds 75
°C, the increase in % E gradually slows because
temperature has an important effect on the thermodynamics of the reaction
process. With increasing temperature, the thermal motion of the ions
increases, and the number of free fluorine ions increases. High temperature
also facilitates the separation of the organic and aqueous phases.
As the temperature increases, the surface tension and viscosity decrease,
thereby weakening the diffusion resistance.27 Hence, % E increases rapidly during the first stage.
Then, as the organic layer reaches saturation, the maximum loading
of fluorine in the organic phase is quickly reached. During this stage,
the mass transfer resistance becomes stronger, and the increase in
% E slows.27 In addition,
according to the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, the Gibbs enthalpy
change (ΔH) was calculated to be 21.63 kJ/mol,
which indicated that the extraction of fluorine was an endothermic
process.16 In conclusion, a higher temperature
and a higher acidity improve the extraction ratio of fluorine.

2.1.2 Effects of the Volume
Ratio of TBP to SIO and the Ratio of Organic to Aqueous Phases
First, constant reaction conditions, namely, a temperature of 90
°C maintained with a water bath, pH −0.46, a phase ratio
(O/A) of 1:5, a stirring speed of 200 rpm, and a reaction time of
1 h, were used. TBP and SIO were each used separately as the organic
phase to extract fluorine. The % E values obtained
with TBP and SIO were 57.6 and 74.8%, respectively. Then, TBP was
combined with SIO to generate mixed organic phases. The volume ratio
(TBP/SIO v/v) was varied from 1:9 to 9:1, and the other reaction conditions
were maintained as described above. Figure 1b shows that % E increased
from 64.7 to 98.2% as the volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) increased from
1:9 to 7:3. However, when the volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) was increased
beyond 7:3, the % E decreased from 98.2 to 92.1%
because when the volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) was 7:3, TBP and SIO were
in the optimal ratio for complexation and offer the best synergistic
effect on fluorine ion separation.11 To
maximize the separation rate and minimize waste, the loading capacity
of the organic phase for fluorine ions had to be maximized, and the
amounts of reagents consumed had to be minimized.27 Thus, 7:3 was chosen as the best volume ratio (TBP/SIO
v/v).

Second, experiments were conducted using phase ratios
(O/A) from 1:1 to 1:10. The other reaction conditions were the same
and were as follows: the temperature was maintained at 90 °C
using a water bath, the pH was −0.46, the volume ratio (TBP/SIO
v/v) was 7:3, the stirring speed was 200 rpm, and the reaction time
was 1 h. As shown in Figure 1b, % E decreased slightly as the phase ratio
(O/A) decreased. When the phase ratio (O/A) was 1:1, % E reached its maximum value of 98.4%. Even when the phase ratio (O/A)
was 1:10, % E reached 80.6% because the contact area
between the organic and aqueous phases decreases with decreasing phase
ratio (O/A). This change has a direct and negative influence on the
interaction between the organic reagents and the fluorine ions. The
loading of fluorine ions was relatively lower at a 1:10 phase ratio
than at a 1:1 phase ratio. In addition, the mass transfer resistance
becomes stronger as the phase ratio decreases. All of these factors
are able to negatively affect the separation rate and lead to a decrease
in % E.27 Based on the
above results, 7:3 is the best volume ratio of TBP to SIO, and a lower
organic to aqueous phase ratio will result in a lower fluorine extraction
rate.

2.1.3 Effect
of the Reaction Time and the Determination of ΔpH
With
the temperature maintained at 90 °C with a water bath, the pH
at −0.46, the volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) at 7:3, the phase
ratio (O/A) at 1:5, and the stirring speed at 200 rpm, experiments
with reaction times ranging from 10 to 120 min were performed to investigate
the effects of the reaction time on the % E. At the
same time, the ΔpH was measured, and this value was determined
as the pH of the aqueous phase at a certain reaction time minus the
pH of the feed solution.

As shown in Figure 2a, % E increases from 56.7
to 98.4% with increasing reaction time, and the ΔpH increases
to a maximum value of 0.10 at 120 min. When the reaction time was
30 min, the % E rapidly increased to 94.1%. Then,
the growth in % E slowed until it reached a maximum
of 98.4% at 120 min. This trend was attributed to the high number
of free fluorine ions in solution and to the interactions between
the organic reagents and the fluorine ions, which were so strong that
% E initially increased quickly.28 Later, as the reaction progresses, the free fluoride content
in the aqueous layer decreases, and at the same time, the potential
additional loading of fluorine decreases. The interactions between
the organic reagents and the fluorine ions became weaker: however,
the mass transfer resistance was stronger, and the separation system
reached equilibrium.27 Hence, during the
last stage, % E remains almost constant with increasing
reaction time. These results suggest that the extraction ratio of
fluorine increases with increasing reaction time.

Figure 2 (a) Effects
of reaction
time on % E and the variation in the pH of the aqueous
phase. (b) Extraction rate of the separation system for fluorine and
phosphoric acid.

Regarding
the increase in ΔpH, the pH of the aqueous phase increased as
the reaction progressed, possibly because hydrogen ions enter the
organic phase and initiate an unknown chemical reaction. The hydrogen
ions may react with other ions in solution to form larger species
that will then enter the organic phase; this kind of process is physical
adsorption.28 Additional validation experiments
and discussions about this speculation are presented in the following
sections (Sections 2.1.6 and 2.1.7). As shown in Figure 1a, a higher acidity will improve
the % E. These results suggest that hydrogen ions
are involved in the extraction process and help improve % E.

2.1.4 Selectivity of the Separation System
Because of their commercial
values, fluorine is considered an impurity in the wet process, whereas
phosphoric acid is the target product. The ideal separation result
would be a high yield of phosphoric acid and a low yield of fluorine.
Some comparative experiments were conducted to investigate the selectivity
of the separation system for fluorine ions over phosphoric acid in
the feed solution under the developed reaction conditions (temperature
maintained at 90 °C with a water bath, pH of −0.46, volume
ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) of 7:3, phase ratio (O/A) of 1:5, stirring speed
of 200 rpm, and reaction time of 50 min). In terms of the results
shown in Figure 2b,
the separation system has a removal rate of 98.3% for fluorine ions
and a removal rate of 2.1% for phosphoric acid. This method not only
has successfully realized the objective of efficiently extracting
fluorine from WPA but also has almost no effect on the phosphoric
acid in WPA. These results confirm that this separation system has
a high selectivity.

2.1.5 Equilibrium of the Separation System
Through the above
experiments, almost all of the reaction parameters for the separation
system were optimized. Some additional experiments were conducted
to investigate the separation system’s equilibrium under the
ideal reaction conditions: the temperature was maintained at 90 °C
using a water bath, the pH was −0.46, the volume ratio (TBP/SIO
v/v) was 7:3, the phase ratio (O/A) was 1:5, the stirring speed was
200 rpm, and the reaction time was 50 min. The fluorine ion distribution
isotherm was obtained from the final experimental data. The McCabe–Thiele
diagram, as shown in Figure 3, indicates that at a phase ratio (O/A) of 1:5, the extraction
rate of fluorine can reach only 98.4% one stage; two stages are theoretically
needed to completely remove the fluorine ions from the aqueous phase.29−31

from
the aqueous phase.

2.1.6 Reaction Mechanism of the Separation System
To determine the mechanism of the separation system, the structural
changes in the organic reagents that occurred during the reactions
were first analyzed with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
As shown in Figure 4a, the main functional groups of TBP, which showed characteristic
peaks at 2961, 1464, 1258, and 1028 cm–1, do not
change during the reaction. Figure 4b shows that the main functional groups of SIO, which
showed characteristic peaks at 2965, 1413, 1263, and 1028 cm–1, also do not change during the reaction. These results suggest that
neither TBP nor SIO is involved in the chemical reactions in the separation
system. Importantly, the after-reaction FTIR spectra of both TBP and
SIO show two new weak peaks at 741 and 481 cm–1 that
are characteristic of HF. These characteristic peaks are weak because
the content of fluoride is very low.32 As
shown in Figure 2a,
the pH value of the aqueous phase increases during the separation
reaction, indicating that hydrogen ions enter the organic phase. It
should be noted that TBP and SIO are immiscible both before and after
the separation process. Moreover, both have strong absorption abilities,
and because SIO has a higher viscosity than TBP (231 mPa·s compared
to 2 mPa·s) at the optimized reaction temperature, the absorption
ability of SIO is higher than that of TBP.33,34 Thus,
no chemical reactions take place; however, physical absorption in
the organic phase does occur, and the reaction process mainly occurs
in the aqueous phase or at the interface of the organic phase and
the aqueous phase.

Figure 4 (a) Comparison of the
FTIR spectra of TBP before
and after the reaction. (b) Comparison of the FTIR spectra of SIO
before and after the reaction.

The results shown in Figures 1a, 2a, and 4 suggest that fluorine ions combined with hydrogen
ions to generate HF, which then entered the organic phase until the
separation system reached equilibrium. Because no chemical reactions
occurred in the organic phase, the HF mainly entered the organic phase
in the form of bubbles under the high-temperature and high-acidity
conditions. If fluorine ions entered the organic phase in the form
of HF bubbles, the bubbles should be visible in the loaded organic
phase under an inverted fluorescence microscope. When the HF bubbles
are forced out of the loaded organic phase using a sufficiently high
temperature, they migrate to the sodium hydroxide solution, resulting
in no or few bubbles in the organic phase and a measurable amount
of fluorine ions in the sodium hydroxide solution. To verify this
hypothesis, two groups of experiments were designed for both TBP and
SIO. Each group contained four experiments for comparison: a blank
experiment (pure organic reagents), a control experiment (pure organic
reagents with deionized water), an unheated experiment (pure organic
reagents with feed solution), and a heated experiment (pure organic
reagents with feed solution). Moreover, all the experiments in each
group were conducted under the reaction conditions described in section 2.1.5, and then
the loaded organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase in each
of the four experiments. The loaded organic phases from the blank
experiment, control experiment, and unheated experiment were directly
analyzed under an inverted fluorescence microscope. The loaded organic
phase of the heated experiment was heated and then analyzed.

Figure 5 shows that
there was almost nothing to observe in the loaded organic phases from
the blank experiment and the control experiment. However, unexpectedly,
bubbles were found in the loaded organic phase from the unheated experiment,
and they disappeared when this phase was heated. Similarly, Figure 6 shows that almost
nothing was found in loaded organic phases from the blank experiment
and the control experiment. However, bubbles were observed in the
loaded organic phase from the unheated experiment, and they disappeared
when this phase was heated. In addition, 80.4% of the fluorine ions
in the loaded organic phase moved to the sodium hydroxide solution.
This result suggests that the bubbles observed in the unheated experiments
are HF bubbles. All of these experimental results are consistent with
our hypothesis. As shown in Figure 1a, a higher temperature and lower pH result in a higher
extraction rate of fluorine, which indicates that under lower pH and
higher temperature conditions, HF bubbles can more easily form and
enter the organic phase.35−37

2.1.7 Reaction Kinetics
of the Separation System
To determine the control type of
the separation reaction, a series of experiments were carried out
in a constant interfacial cell. The volumes of the aqueous and organic
phases were constant and equal to 400 mL. The stirring speeds of the
aqueous and organic phases were equal, and the interfacial area between
the two phases was varied. First, the stirring speed was varied from
0 to 400 rpm to investigate the effect of stirring speed on the fluorine
separation rate. The other reaction conditions were set as follows:
temperature of 90 °C, pH −0.46, volume ratio (TBP/SIO
v/v) of 7:3, interfacial area of 28.26 cm2, and reaction
time of 50 min. Then, the interfacial area was varied from 3.14 to
113.04 cm2 to investigate the effect of the interfacial
area on the fluorine separation rate. The other reaction conditions
were set as follows: temperature of 90 °C, pH −0.46, volume
ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) of 7:3, stirring speed of 200 rpm, and reaction
time of 50 min. As shown in Figure 7, the separation rate increases with increasing stirring
speed. At stirring rates below 200 rpm, the separation rate increased
linearly with increasing stirring speed. However, above 200 rpm, the
separation speed changes very little, and this is called the dam region.
The separation speed increases linearly with increasing interfacial
area, and the line does not pass through the origin. Hence, the separation
process occurs through hybrid control (diffusion control and interfacial
reaction control).38

Figure 7 Effect
of stirring speed and interfacial area on fluorine separation rate.

The results
shown in Figures 4 and 7 indicate that the main chemical reactions in the
separation process take place in the interfacial area between the
two phases instead of in the organic phase. From a kinetic perspective,
fluorine ions aggregate in the form of small HF bubbles near the interface
of the aqueous phase and organic phase during heat treatment. The
small bubbles begin to diffuse from the interface into the TBP layer
and the SIO layer. Some HF bubbles aggregate at the interface of TBP
and SIO and then begin to diffuse from the interface into the SIO
layer; the TBP acts as the surfactant in this process, facilitating
diffusion by decreasing the surface tension, and the SIO acts as the
adsorbent.39,40 According to the above results and previous
reports, the kinetic process of this separation system can be described
by the following equations 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  where b and d represent the status
of the bubbles and drops, respectively, and the other letters (m, m1, m2, n, n1, n2, x, x1, y, y1, and z) are the corresponding scaling factors.

Nanometer-sized
HF bubbles form first and then aggregate at the interface of the aqueous
and organic phases. The nanometer-sized cores of the HF bubbles gradually
grow into small HF bubbles. With increasing temperature, the saturated
vapor pressure of HF increases. When the vapor pressure becomes strong
enough to overcome the surface tension of the liquid, the small HF
bubbles begin to enter the organic phase from the aqueous phase through
the interface. Based on the Antoine equation and Laplace equation,41 the saturated vapor pressure and the liquid
surface tension can be calculated by eqs 8 and 9, respectively, as follows 9   10  where A, B, and C are Antoine
constants; T is the thermodynamic temperature; P is the saturated vapor pressure in eq 9; σ stands for the surface tension; r is the capillary radius; ρ is the density; g is gravitational acceleration; and h is
the height of the liquid column in eq 10. The critical temperature can be calculated by combining
and solving eqs 9 and 10. By controlling the critical temperature, some
behaviors of the HF bubbles in the organic phase can be investigated.
According to Taylor
and Zhang et al.,27 the diameter of the
HF bubbles at a particular stage can be estimated by eq 10 as follows 11  where Rb is the diameter of the HF bubble, σ is the surface
tension, g is the gravitational acceleration, ρf is the density of the liquid, and ρg is
the density of the gas. Based on the report by Shen et al.,27 the number of HF bubbles absorbed in the organic
phase can be calculated by the Gibbs adsorption formula using eqs 11 and 12 12   13  where Γ is the adsorption capacity
of the solute, a is the activity of the solute, σ
is the surface tension, c is the concentration of
the solution, R = 8.31 × 107 erg·mol–1·K–1, and T is the thermodynamic temperature. In general, if the concentration
of the solution is not sufficiently large, Γ should be calculated
by eq 13 instead of eq 12. Experiments were conducted
to determine the relative parameters, which could be used to calculate
the theoretical values of Rb according
to eq 11. The final
results are shown in Table 1. To verify the accuracy of the kinetic theory, the theoretical
values and the actual values from the kinetic experiments were compared.
The actual values of Rb were obtained
as shown in Figure 8. The theoretical values and the actual values were quite similar.
Thus, the separation mechanism based on the passage of bubbles through
a membrane was confirmed based on the kinetic data.

value of Rb at 90 °C.

2.2 Scrubbing and Stripping
2.2.1 Determination of the Best
Stripping Agent
After scrubbing the loaded organic phase
with deionized water, samples of the loaded organic phase were mixed
with different stripping agents at the same molar concentration (2.5
mol/L). The reactions were performed with the temperature maintained
at 25 °C with a water bath, a stirring speed of 200 rpm, a loaded
organic to stripping aqueous phase ratio (O/A) of 1:4, and a reaction
time of 1 h. As shown in Table 2, sodium hydroxide solution provided the best fluorine stripping
rate (% S of 63.2%). Its stripping rate was far better
than those of H2SO4 solution (% S of 0.28%) and KCl solution (% S of 0.47%). Hence,
sodium hydroxide solution was chosen as the best stripping agent.

Stripping Agents under the Same Reaction Conditions

KCl solution	0.05	10.59	0.47	
2.2.2 Effects of Temperature
Temperatures ranging from 15 to 100 °C were tested to investigate
the effects of temperature on % S. The other reaction
parameters were maintained as follows: the concentration of the sodium
hydroxide solution [NaOH] was set as 2.5 mol/L, the stirring speed
was 200 rpm, the phase ratio (O/A) was 1:4, and the reaction time
was 1 h. Figure 9a
shows that % S decreases with increasing temperature
and reaches a maximum value of 64.3% at 15 °C. This result suggests
that a higher temperature decreases % S. Hence, room
temperature (20–25 °C) was chosen as the best stripping
temperature.

Figure 9 (a) Effects
of temperature on % S. (b) Effects of [NaOH] and
reaction time on % S.

2.2.3 Effects of the Concentration of the Sodium Hydroxide Solution and
the Reaction Time
To determine the optimal concentration
for the sodium hydroxide solution, experiments using [NaOH] concentrations
between 1 and 12 mol/L were conducted. The other reaction conditions
were maintained as follows: the temperature was maintained at room
temperature, the stirring speed was 200 rpm, the phase ratio (O/A)
was 1:4, and the reaction time was 1 h. As shown in Figure 9b, % S first
increased and then decreased as [NaOH] was increased. % S reached its maximum value (79.6%) at 2 mol/L. Hence, 2 mol/L was
chosen as the best sodium hydroxide concentration for the stripping
solution.

With [NaOH] set at 2 mol/L, the temperature set at
room temperature, the stirring speed set at 200 rpm, and the phase
ratio (O/A) set at 1:4, experiments using different reaction times
ranging from 10 to 120 min were carried out to determine the best
reaction time. As shown in Figure 9b, as the reaction time increased, % S first rapidly increased and then gradually increased at times greater
than a critical point (30 min). At 30 min, %S was 77.3%, and it reached
its maximum value (79.1%) at 120 min. Hence, 30 min was chosen as
the stripping time.

2.2.4 Effects of the Volume Ratio of the Loaded Organic Phase to the
Stripping Aqueous Phase
Volume ratios of the loaded organic
phase to the stripping aqueous phase (O/A) ranging from 1:10 to 2:1
were tested to investigate the effects of the loaded organic phase
to stripping aqueous phase ratio on the % S. The
other conditions were maintained as follows: the temperature was set
at room temperature, stirring speed was set at 200 rpm, [NaOH] was
set at 2 mol/L, and reaction time was set at 30 min. Figure 10 shows that % S decreased with increasing phase ratio (O/A) and reached a maximum
value of 90.1% at 1:10. These results suggest that a lower phase ratio
(O/A) will generate a higher % S.

ratio (O/A) on the % S.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, an efficient separation method based on a bubble membrane for
removing fluorine ions from WPA using a solvent was introduced. TBP
was mixed with SIO as the organic phase, and sodium hydroxide solution
was chosen as the stripping agent. The best extraction rate (98.4%)
was achieved at a temperature of 90 °C, a pH of −0.46,
a volume ratio (TBP/SIO v/v) of 7:3, a phase ratio (O/A) of 1:5, a
stirring speed of 200 rpm, and a reaction time of 50 min. The best
stripping rate (90.1%) was achieved at room temperature, a [NaOH]
of 2 mol/L, a phase ratio (O/A) of 1:10, a stirring speed of 200 rpm,
and a reaction time of 30 min. The McCabe–Thiele diagram showed
that two theoretical stages were needed to completely remove the fluorine.
The reaction mechanism and kinetics were also investigated. The separation
system functioned under hybrid control (diffusion control and interfacial
reaction control). The separation system had a very high selectivity
for fluorine ions and almost no impact on the phosphoric acid. The
results of this study meet the requirements for the industrial production
of WPA. In summary, this separation method based on a bubble membrane
not only has substantial commercial advantages, such as high efficiency,
high selectivity, low pollutant generation, operational simplicity,
and direct extraction capability, but also has a high practical value
and broad applicability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TBP (C12H27PO4, 99.5%), SIO (C3H9SiO(C2H6SiO)nSiC3H9, 99%), sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, 95.5%), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%) were purchased from Damao (Chemical Reagent
Factory in Tianjin, China) and were of analytical grade. Deionized
water was used in all experiments. The phosphate ore used in our experiments
was obtained from Weng’an, Guizhou Province, China. To determine
the trace compounds in the phosphate ore, the following steps were
taken. A portion of phosphate ore was placed in a ball mill and sieved
until a powder of <0.12 mm was obtained. Then, the phosphate powder
was dissolved and assessed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS). The results are shown in Table 3.

4.2 Apparatus and Analyses
The trace amounts of various
components in the phosphate ore were determined by ICP-MS (Agilent
7900, Japan). The content of fluorine in WPA was determined by a potentiometric
titrator with a fluorine ion-selective electrode and a saturated calomel
electrode (Shanghai Youyi Yoyilab PF-1-02/232-01). The content of
phosphoric acid in WPA was determined by the quinoline phosphomolybdate
gravimetric method. The functional groups of the organic reagents
were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy (IRAffinity-1, Japan). The loaded
organic phase was investigated under an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Nikon Ti-s, Japan).

4.3 Procedures
4.3.1 Fluorine
Ion Standard Solution Preparation
The solution of fluoride
(0.1 mg/mL) was prepared using NaF (GB/T1264) that had been dried
to a constant weight at 120 °C. Then, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 mL of
the fluorine ion solution were transferred to five separate 50 mL
volumetric flasks. Next, the concentration of fluoride in each flask
was measured with the ion-specific electrode method. The standard
curve of fluoride was prepared from the above experimental data. The
equation of the standard curve obtained was y = 25.1829x – 171.3418 with an R2 of 0.9997. With that standard curve in hand, the content of fluorine
in WPA could be accurately calculated in the subsequent experiments.

4.3.2 Feed Solution Preparation
Phosphoric ore powder (10.5 g, < 0.12 mm) was placed in a 100
mL beaker. Deionized water (40 mL) and 8 mL of phosphoric acid were
added to the breaker, which was then placed in a 75 °C water
bath. The mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 2 h, and then 6 mL of
sulfuric acid was added. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was vacuum-filtered
to collect the filtrate. The filtrate was diluted with deionized water
to 1000 mL in a volumetric flask. The obtained solution is the feed
solution, which had a pH of 1.21 and a fluoride concentration of 320
mg/L, and the leaching rate of fluorine was 82.8%.

4.3.3 Separation Process and Analytical
Methods
The feed solution and organic phase were combined
in a beaker. The beaker was kept in a constant-temperature water bath
and was stirred for a certain time. The mixture was transferred to
a separatory funnel and allowed to stand until the mixture fully separated
into layers. The aqueous phase was drained from the funnel, and the
loaded organic phase was scrubbed and stripped to obtain the strip
liquor. The aqueous phase and the strip liquor were gathered for testing.
The above steps represent the entire separation process, and the values
of all the reaction parameters were set according to the subsequent
practical experiments.

The equation for the extraction ratio
of fluorine ions (% E) was as follows: 14  where [F–]BF and [F–]AF represent the masses of fluorine ions in the aqueous
phase before and after the reaction, respectively. The content of
phosphoric acid in the aqueous phase was calculated from the following
equation: 15  where m1 is the mass of precipitated
quinoline phosphomolybdate and the crucible, m2 is the mass of the crucible, m3 is the mass of the precipitate and the crucible in the blank control
experiment, m4 is the mass of the crucible
in the blank control experiment, m is the mass of
sample that was obtained from a certain quantity of aqueous solution,
and 0.03207 is a mass coefficient. The stripping yield of fluorine
(% S) in the loaded organic phase was calculated
with the following equation: 16  where [F–]SL is the weight of fluorine ions in the strip liquor
and the [F–]BF and [F–]AF are the same as those in eq 14.
