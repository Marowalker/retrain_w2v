Biologically compatible
fluorescent ion sensors, particularly those that are reversible, represent
a key tool for answering a range of fundamental biological questions.
We report a rationally designed probe with a 6′-fluoro spiropyran
scaffold (5) for the reversible sensing of zinc (Zn2+) in cells. The 6′-fluoro substituent overcomes several
limitations normally associated with spiropyran-based sensors to provide
an improved signal-to-background ratio and faster photoswitching times
in aqueous solution. In vitro studies were performed with 5 and the 6′-nitro analogues (6) in HEK 293 and
endothelial cells. The new spiropyran (5) can detect
exogenous Zn2+ inside both cell types and without affecting
the proliferation of endothelial cells. Studies were also performed
on dying HEK 293 cells, with results demonstrating the ability of
the key compound to detect endogenous Zn2+ efflux from
cells undergoing apoptosis. Biocompatibility and photoswitching of 5 were demonstrated within endothelial cells but not with 6, suggesting the future applicability of sensor 5 to study intracellular Zn2+ efflux in these systems.

Introduction
Fluorescent chemosensors
capable of detecting, quantifying, and imaging specific molecules
or ions are essential tools in cell biology and medical diagnostic
imaging.1,2 An important advance in this area would
come with the development of reversible sensors that allow continuous
or repeated measurement within a biological sample.3 In this case, the sensor remains in a nonfluorescent state
(“Off”) in-between measurements and switches to a highly
fluorescent state (“On”) under an external stimulus,
only when a measurement is required. The Off–On transition
is controlled by a selected external stimulus (e.g., light). Such
sensors allow multiple measurements to be conducted on a single sample
without the need to change the sensor. This has clear advantages in
biological applications where sample volume and availability are often
limited.4

Spiropyrans are among the
most extensively studied photoswitchable fluorophores used in such
sensors. A spiropyran can be reversibly switched from a low-fluorescent
spiro form (SP) to the highly fluorescent ring-opened merocyanine
form (MC) on irradiation with UV light or on binding to a suitable
analyte, for example, see Scheme 1.5−9 This occurs
with a high switching reliability and low fatigue to maximize the
number of switching cycles between the two isomers. These structures
have found wide use as a basis of reversible sensors for the detection
of metal ions,10 amino acids,11 and other species such as cyanide ion12 when appropriately functionalized to allow analyte
binding to the MC isomer, for example, see MC–Zn2+ in Scheme 1.

Also shown are the isomeric structures
of spiropyran
in the absence and presence of Zn2+ and white light. Final
structures of spiropyran (SP) and merocyanine isomers (MC) for sensor 5 are depicted, where the dashed lines depict bindings of
Zn2+ to the MC ligand. The spiropyran-Zn2+ sensing
mechanism depicted here was reported by Rivera-Fuentes et al. on a
similar analogue using density functional theory calculations.8 Also depicted is the 6′-NO2 analogue (6, boxed).

The most common spiropyran scaffold used in these applications contains
a 6′-nitro group on the chromene moiety (see Scheme 1, 6).13 This choice has a traditional basis, with these
structures being readily prepared from nitro-substituted o-hydroxy aromatic aldehydes but also because the electron withdrawing
NO2 substituent imparts high quantum yields for fluorescence-based
sensing. Despite widespread use, these structures are somewhat problematic
in biological systems because the photochromic characteristics of
6′-nitro-substituted spiropyrans are highly susceptible to
the solvent environment.14 In general,
the ring-closed spiro (SP) isomer is favored in nonpolar solvents,
whereas the merocyanine isomer (MC) is favored in polar solvents.15,16 The latter effect results in a high background fluorescence and
poor signal-to-background ratio even in the absence of substrates,
thus limiting sensitivity in sensor-based applications. The introduction
of an electron-donating group (EDG), such as t-butyl17 or methyl,18 renders
the photochromic properties of spiropyran less susceptible to these
solvent effects.19 However, such analogues
lack solubility in water and display significantly lower quantum yields
with the loss of switching efficiency.20,21 All of this
highlights a need to develop new spiropyran analogues with improved
spectroscopic properties in aqueous media to further expand the use
of spiropyrans in biological and other sensing applications.

Here, we present a new and rationally designed 6′-fluoro substituted
spiropyran sensor (see 5 in Scheme 1) that overcomes many of the before-mentioned
limitations. A moderately electron withdrawing fluorine was incorporated
to suppress photoisomerization in polar solvents, as is associated
with the strongly electron withdrawing NO2 derivatives.
This system was anticipated to retain relatively high fluorescence
yields and aqueous solubility found in NO2-substituted
derivatives but which is lost on incorporating an EDG group.21 A bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine substituent was
incorporated into the spiropyran scaffold to promote binding of Zn2 to the ring-opened MC form, see Scheme 1. Sensor 5 contains an aryl
carboxylate for increasing hydrophilicity as required for biological
applications, while retaining cell permeability, as shown in previous
studies.22 Zn2+ was chosen for
this study because of its essential role in a range of cellular processes,
such as enzyme activity, structural integrity, and oocyte maturation
and fertilization.23,24 Disruption of its homeostasis
is also associated with numerous disease states such as cancer and
Alzheimer’s disease,25−27 and sensors for detecting Zn2+ in biology constitute
the largest class of fluorescent indicators for transition metals.1,28−31

Despite Zn2+ being one
of the most widely studied essential ions, its precise role in many
biological processes is not well understood. For example, the relative
harmful and protective effects of intracellular Zn2+ during
endothelial cell function and apoptosis remain to be defined.32−34 Zn2+ deficiency disrupts
endothelial cell barrier function by various inflammatory, oxidative,
and apoptotic agents in vitro,33,35,36 whereas physiological amounts of Zn2+ attenuate the endothelial
dysfunction produced by the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα).37 A specific
sensor for Zn2+ that can be turned on and off on demand
would provide an opportunity to monitor changes in ion fluctuations
and advance our knowledge of Zn2+ flux in various acute
and chronic vascular disease processes, such as myocardial or cerebral
infarction, atherosclerosis, and cancer related angiogenesis.

Results and Discussion
Computational Analysis and Synthesis of Sensor 5
The ability of the MC isomer of 6-fluoro 5 to bind Zn2+, relative to previously reported 6-nitro 6,4,10 was first studied computationally (Vienna
ab initio simulation package).38 MC 6 is known to show high selectivity for Zn2+ over
other metal ions. The Zn2+–9′-phenolic oxygen
and Zn2+–pyridine-nitrogen distances for sensor 5 and 6 were determined to be between 1.90 and
2.01 Å, with no significant difference between the two analogues
(see Scheme 1 for substituent
numbering scheme for the MC isomer). Interestingly, despite the substitution
of NO2 for a less electron withdrawing F at the 6′
position on the chromene moiety, the electronic charge densities around
the benzopyran ring for 5 and 6 are similar
(Figure 1), with binding
affinities calculated to the range 540–550 kcal/mol. This suggests
that both derivatives should display similar selectivity for Zn2+ (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Images of electronic charge density of spiropyran 5 (A, B) and 6 (C, D) in the presence of Zn2+ (gray). (A) and (C) show density in a best-fit plane to
the functional group (F and NO2), the benzopyran ring, and
the O that bonds to the Zn2+. (B) and (D) show through
the functional groups, the O and Zn2+, respectively. In
addition, (A) and (C) show the electronic charge density around the
benzopyran ring. The perspective is perpendicular to the plane shown
in all cases.

Sensor 5 was then synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Benzylic bromide
(2) was prepared by reaction of the N-substituted benzylaldehyde with paraformaldehyde in the presence
of HBr. Reaction of these halides with bis(2-pyridylmethyl) amine
gave 3, respectively, which was reacted with 4,39 with final purification by normal-phase
chromatography, giving the desired sensor 5, as detailed
in the Supporting Information section. 1H, 13C NMR spectra for sensor 5 can
be found in the Supporting Information section.

Spectroscopic Analysis and Characterization
of Sensor 5
The spectroscopic properties of
sensor 5 and 6 were then compared to experimentally
define the relative influence of the 6′-substituent to ion
binding. The resulting absorbance spectra of sensors 5 and 6 are essentially identical, with a uniform 10-fold
greater absorbance between 510 and 535 nm in the presence of Zn2+ compared to the spectra in the absence of the ion (see Figure S10 (Supporting Information)). This increase in absorbance is the result of Zn2+-induced
thermal switching to the more colored merocyanine state and indicates
the formation of the MC–Zn2+ complex in all cases
(see Scheme 1). The
formation of the MC–Zn2+ complex was also verified
by 1H NMR and HRMS, as detailed in the Supporting Information section. Interestingly, the fluorescence
emission maximum for 5 (670 nm) is significantly red
shifted compared to 6 (615 nm, Figure S11 and Table S1 (Supporting Information)). The observed red shift for spiropyran 5 is advantageous
for biological imaging because autofluorescence and scattering within
tissues is minimal at these longer wavelengths.8 Next, the quantum yield of 5 in the presence
of excess Zn2+ (i.e., MC(5)/Zn2+ complex) was determined to be 0.0028 using rhodamine B as the calibration
standard, according to the method detailed in the Supporting Information section. The effect of the 6′-substituent
is most pronounced here as quantum yield for MC(5)/Zn2+ is approximately 10-fold less than that of MC(6)/Zn2+. This is to be expected as the 6′-nitro
is known to impart higher quantum yields for spiropyran-based molecules.
The low quantum yield is not expected to greatly affect the performance
of the sensor due to the low background in the absence of Zn2+.

Sensor 5 was next assayed against other biologically
relevant metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Cs+, Pb2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Na+, Co2+, K+, Ba2+, Mn2+, and Be+) and the results compared to
data for 6,10 to characterize
ion selectivity profiles. Results in Figure 2 show that spiropyran 5 was
determined to be highly selective for Zn in the presence of other
biologically relevant ions. The stoichiometry of binding of 5 and Zn2+ was determined to be 1:1 (MC(5)/Zn2+) using Job’s method of continuous variations,
see Figure S12A (Supporting Information). Concentration-dependent curves show that the
fluorescence of the new spiropyran 5 increased proportionally
with increasing Zn2+ concentrations, where the limit of
detection under these experimental conditions (with 5 at 50 μM in water) was determined to be approximately 1 μM
(Figure S12B (Supporting Information)). This detection limit is well below that required
for biological applications for diseased cells, where zinc concentrations
are expected to increase on the order of micromolar.30,40

relevant ions dissolved in 100 μM of water. Metal ions were
of the perchlorate or chloride form depending on availability. Black
bars represent the fluorescence maximum (Ex = 532 nm, Em = 670 nm)
obtained for sensor 5 incubated with a single metal ion.
Gray bars represent the fluorescence maximum (Ex = 532 nm, Em = 670
nm) obtained for sensor 5 incubated with 1:1 mixture
of Zn2+ and a second ion. Experiments were carried out
using 96-well plates. Data was processed using GraphPad Prism 7.

Photoswitching between the fluorescent MC–Zn2+ complexes and the nonfluorescent SP isomers of sensors 5 and 6 was next studied in detail. Aqueous solutions
of compounds 5 and 6 (0.8 mM in water) were
premixed with Zn2+ ions (2 mM in water) in 20 μm
deep wells on a microscope slide and the fluorescence measured using
modified glass slides and an automated commercial fluorescence microscope,
as illustrated in Figure S13A,B (Supporting Information). Binding to Zn2+ ions caused an increase in the fluorescence for both spiropyrans,
producing emission maxima between 615 and 680 nm. Irradiation with
white light, for photoswitching back to the SP isomer, resulted in
a decreased fluorescence that is consistent with the nonphotoswitched
intensity, demonstrating photoreversibility. Incubation of 5 with Zn2+ in the dark results in rebinding of Zn2+ and the formation of the fluorescent Zn2+–MC
complexes. This was repeated over multiple cycles, with the results
shown in Figure 3A.
Sensor 5 showed clear photoswitching over the time course
of the experiment without any apparent photobleaching (see blue traces
in Figure 3A). Furthermore,
switching dynamics for sensor 5 is well approximated
by single exponential increase (On) and decay (Off), to give switch-on
and off time constants of τOn = 42 s, τOff = 2.2 s respectively (Figure 3B,C). In comparison, multiple cycles of alternate
irradiation with visible light and incubation in the dark did not
give rise to photoswitching for 6, with a decrease in
fluorescence apparent over time, presumably due to photobleaching
(Figure 3A, green).
The steady state in fluorescence intensities of the On and Off state
obtained is promising and future work will be focused on expanding
the application of sensor 5 for repeated measurements
in detecting Zn2+ in cells.

Cellular Studies 1: Sensing of Zn2+ in HEK 293 Cells
The relative abilities of 5 and 6 to
reversibly sense Zn2+ in live cells was next examined.
Separate solutions of spiropyrans 5 and 6 (10 μM in water) were incubated with HEK 293 cells pretreated
with zinc perchlorate (50 μM in water) and zinc pyrithione (20
μM in water) for 30 min to facilitate the rapid accumulation
of intracellular zinc.41 The thus formed
MC–Zn2+ complex was then irradiated with the 559
nm laser from the confocal microscope, which resulted in a red fluorescence
within the cells characteristic with this complex (Figure 4A,C). Subsequent exposure of
the cells to visible light for 8 s gave rise to a decrease in fluorescence
in both cases, consistent with the photoswitching from the fluorescent
MC–Zn2+ complex back to the nonfluorescent SP isomer,
see Figure 3B,D. Repeated
cycles of photoswitching gave reproducible changes in fluorescence,
and as such both spiropyrans reversibly photoswitch in cells, see Figure 4. In contrast, photoswitching
for 6 was not achieved after the first On/Off cycle and
this observation is consistent with previous solution-based studies.
Importantly, the red fluorescence was approximately 3× greater
for 5 compared to that of 6 (Figure 4A,B). These results are consistent
with the earlier solution-based observations, where the signal-to-background
ratio for 5 is approximately three-fold better than the
signal-to-background ratio for 6 (see Table S1 (Supporting Information)). This provides an important basis for probing changes in the intracellular
Zn2+ level, where the high background fluorescence decreases
the precision of fluorescence intensity measurements.42

Figure 4 Comparison
of fluorescence
intensities of 5 (A, C) and 6 (B, D) in
HEK 293 cells. The cells were irradiated (559 nm) and imaged for 8
s, controlled by visible light from the confocal microscope. Fluorescence
microscopy images of the cells at illumination time t = 0 (A, B) and t = 8 s (C, D) are shown. The graph
in the center shows a typical fluorescence intensity evolution over
time in arbitrary units (a.u.) obtained from fluorescence images of
a selected group of cells. Photoswitching for sensor 5 was not observed after the first On/Off cycle.

Next, experiments were conducted to reveal the ability
of the new and optimum sensor 5 to detect Zn2+ efflux from cells undergoing apoptosis. Dying cells are known to
have increased levels of liable intracellular Zn2+ due
to changes in the intracellular redox state liberating Zn2+ from protein thiolate bonds.43,44 Sensor 5 was incubated with (i) healthy cells (Figure S6 (Supporting Information)) and
(ii) HEK 293 cells treated with 50–200 nM, staurosporine, a
reagent known to induce apoptosis in cells.45 As before, changes in fluorescence and hence binding of 5 to intracellular Zn2+ were detected using confocal microscopy.
Fluorescence was not observed in healthy cells (Figure S14 (Supporting Information)). In contrast, the results shown in Figure 5A–C clearly show red fluorescence
in dying cells as the concentration of staurosporine was increased,
demonstrating the ability of 5 to detect endogenous Zn2+ efflux from cells undergoing apoptosis. This paves the way
for use of 5 in cellular studies in particular, to understand
the changes in intracellular zinc levels during apoptosis.44

Figure 5 Confocal images of 5 incubated
with HEK 293 cells treated with (A) 50 nM, (B) 100 nM, and (C) 200
nM staurosporine; confocal images represented by (top row) phase contrast,
(middle) red channel, and (bottom) merging. The addition of the cell-permeable
chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN)
decreased the fluorescence, confirming that the fluorescence turn-on
is induced by Zn2+.

Cellular Studies
2: Sensing of Exogenous Zn2+ and Photoswitching Experiments
in Endothelial Cells
The ability of 5 and 6 to detect Zn2+ was further assessed in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a well-established model
to study endothelial cell biology. First, HUVECs were separately incubated
with 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μM, 10 μM, and 100 μM 5 or 6 for up to 72 h to examine and compare
the effect of each sensor on cell proliferation, as determined by
a colorimetric assay based on water soluble tetrazolium 1 (WST 1).
The longer exposure times, particularly above 24 h, are important
for determining the toxicity of the sensors with prolonged incubation.
The results in Figure 6 and in the corresponding Supporting Information section (Figures S15 and S16) show that
concentrations up to 1 μM of both sensors do not affect cell
proliferation significantly. This is consistent with literature findings
on general toxicity of spiropyrans.46 Significantly,
endothelial cell growth was unaffected by incubation with sensor 5 at 10 μM for up to 72 h. In comparison, a marked decline
in endothelial cell growth was observed with >1 μM sensor 6 (Figure 6).

different time points of exposure to 0–100 μM zinc sensor 5 or 6, to determine early and late effects of
exposure to the sensor. Cell proliferation is expressed as a percentage,
considering cell proliferation in the absence of sensor as 100% (dotted
line). (A) Two hours with sensors, washed with culture media, and

washed with culture media, and WST 1 assay after 72 h. (E) Twenty
four hours with sensor and WST 1 assay at the end of exposure. (F)
Seventy two hours with sensor and WST 1 assay at the end of exposure.

Finally, the relative ability of 5 and 6 to reversibly sense Zn2+ in HUVECs was determined.
Separate solutions of 5 and 6 (10 μM
in water) were incubated for 2 h with HUVECs pretreated with excess
zinc perchlorate (50 μM in water) and zinc pyrithione (20 μM
in water) for 30 min to facilitate rapid accumulation of intracellular
Zn2+, as per previous experiments with HEK 293 cells. All
HUVECs were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to locate the nucleus.
As before, the thus formed MC–Zn2+ complexes 5 or 6 were irradiated with green laser from
the confocal microscope,
as detailed in the Supporting Information section. Results in Figures 7 and 8 show that sensor 5 shows an approximately 6-fold increase in red fluorescence within
the cells’ complex. Subsequent exposure of the cells to visible
light for 10 s gave rise to a decrease in fluorescence, consistent
with photoswitching from the fluorescent MC isomer back to the nonfluorescent
SP isomer, see Figure 8. Photoswitching was not apparent for sensor 6 (10 μM)
under the same experimental conditions, with fluorescence intensities
for 6 unexpectedly decreasing with the addition of Zn2+ (Figure 8). This is consistent with earlier solution-based experiments, where
photoswitching for 6 was not observed (see Figure 3). These preliminary photoswitching
studies show that photoswitching clearly occurs with sensor 5 in HUVECs but not for 6 (Figure 9). In addition, cell
detachment and reduced emission from Hoechst 33342 stain were also
observed, possibly due to the interaction of 6 with the
nuclear stain. These results are consistent with earlier cell proliferation
studies discussed above and demonstrate that the NO2-substituted
sensor (6) is not suitable for sensing applications in
HUVECs. Ongoing work is focused on using 5 to study changes
in intracellular Zn2+ levels in early to late passage endothelial
cells (Figure 8).

Conclusions
Zn2+ is a ubiquitous
cellular ion that plays a critical role in the modulation of fundamental
cellular processes, and an ability to sense and determine fluctuations
of its cellular concentration is central to many biological and medical
applications. However, sensing Zn2+ is not straightforward
as intracellular concentrations vary greatly during a typical cell
cycle, with a variety of plasma membrane Zn2+ permeable
channels and intracellular sources contributing to these fluctuations.
Although several highly selective and sensitive fluorescent chemosensors
for intracellular one-off sensing of Zn2+ are known, few
can function reversibly and on demand. To meet this need, we have
rationally designed and developed a new spiropyran-based sensor (5) with F at the 6′ position and a bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine
group as the ionophore to facilitate the binding of Zn2+. This single F substitution gives rise to a significantly improved
Zn2+ sensing and signal-to-background ratio, as well as
faster photoswitching times in aqueous solution compared to existing
spiropyran-based sensors. Importantly, cell toxicity was not observed
for 5 within the concentrations used for sensing and
an ability to reversibly sense Zn2+ in HEK 293 and endothelial
cells is retained. We suggest this new spiropyran as the analytical
tool of choice for a range of light-responsive zinc sensors and materials.
