This article adds a new direction
to the functional capability
of protein-protected atomically precise gold clusters as sensors.
Counting on the extensively researched intense luminescence of these
clusters and considering the electron donating nature of select amino
acids, we introduce a dual probe sensor capable of sensing changes
in luminescence and conductivity, utilizing bovine serum albumin-protected
atomically precise gold clusters hosted on nanofibers. To this end,
we have also developed a hybrid nanofiber with a conducting core with
a porous dielectric shell. We show that clusters in combination with
nanofibers offer a highly selective and sensitive platform for the
detection of trace quantities of trinitrotoluene, both in solution
and in the vapor phase. In the solution phase, trinitrotoluene (TNT)
can be detected down to 1 ppt at room temperature, whereas in vapor
phase, 4.8 × 109 molecules of TNT can be sensed using
a 1 mm fiber. Although the development in electrospinning techniques
for fabricating nanofibers as sensors is quite substantial, a hybrid
fiber with the dual properties of conductivity and luminescence has
not been reported yet.

Introduction
Atomically precise
clusters of noble metals encapsulated in proteins
belong to an expanding area of research.1 Because of their diverse properties they have been used in areas,
such as catalysis,2,3 energy,4 sensors,5 biomedicine,6−8 and environment.9 One of the most fascinating properties of such
materials is luminescence, which has been used extensively in sensing,5,10 mostly in solutions. On the basis of this inherent property, the
protein-protected noble metal clusters were deemed to be a new class
of nanoscale sensors for label-free detection of various biomolecules,
such as protease11 and hemoglobin12 as well as several metal ions13−15 and others.
Sensing is mainly due to the large quantum yield and associated enhancement
in emission upon binding on solid surfaces, enabling extremely low
levels of detection down to a few tens of ions. Research on the use
of these materials as optical sensors10 using luminescence has been so intense that the possibility of utilizing
the same clusters as conductivity sensors has not been considered
seriously. The luminescence of protein-protected clusters (PPCs) arise
from the intraband transitions in the cluster.16 The existing literature suggests that proteins in both
dry and wet states are capable of increasing the conductivity of a
system as they are semiconducting in nature.17 The protein protecting the cluster can also contribute to conductivity.
Besides, free protein present along with PPCs also contribute to conductivity.
During the formation of the metallic core, interprotein metal-ion
transfer occurs in the solution, leading to the regeneration of free
proteins from protein–metal adducts.16 Increase in the core size within a protein further increases the
free protein content in the solution.18 To utilize both the conductivity and luminescence attributes of
the protein-protected cluster to the maximum, suitable detection techniques
and substrates are required.

Most of the detection protocols
at the device level prefer electrical
conductivity-based probes because of the ease of fabrication, cheaper
components, and their quantitative analysis. Optical sensors have
also started making an impact in the field of lab-on-a-chip devices
owing to the miniaturization of the various components involved in
it, providing faster on-the-spot qualitative analysis. A platform
combining these two sensors provides quantitative and qualitative
analysis, reducing false alarms. A dual mode sensor can be useful
in point-of-use devices with extreme sensitivity. Incorporation of
clusters in suitably modified electrospun nanofibers enables the fabrication
of such dual mode sensors.

Electrospinning as a fabrication
technique has acquired prominence
in the area of sensors due to its versatility and flexibility. On
the basis of the materials used, electrospun fibers can be used as
conductivity sensors,19−21 optical sensors,22,23 strain sensors,24,25 electrochemical sensors,26 etc. Electrospinning
is considered to be a versatile technique as it allows the user to
play around with materials to modify the inherent ability of the polymer
utilized. Composite fibers produced using electrospinning find applications
in various areas.27 Additionally, coaxial
electrospinning provides the opportunity to make hybrid fibers out
of two or more completely different materials, with each material
adding a different functionality to a single fiber, allowing the use
of such a fiber for various applications.28 Oxide-based nanofibers have carved a niche as gas sensors29 either by conductivity30,31 or by optical properties.32 Conducting
additives like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc., have been
utilized to enhance the conductivity of a conducting polymer or to
induce it in a usually insulating fiber.27 Although the development of nanofibers as conductivity sensors or
optical sensors is individually an extensively researched area, a
fiber which can combine both these properties has not been fabricated
to the best of our knowledge.

The main deterrent for the development
of fibers with dual functionality
of conductivity and luminescence is the common dark color of conducting
polymers, which make them inappropriate as luminescent substrates.
The main aspect of this article is to show that protein-protected
clusters immobilized on a composite fiber with a conducting core and
a dielectric shell can be utilized as dual functionality sensors.
Thus, as a whole, the system acts like a lab-on-a-fiber. The amorphous
nature of the dielectric material used helps to act as a good host
for the cluster and can be conjugated with the cluster by either surface
modification or simply by physisorption. In this article, we have
utilized the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) core with silica
(SiO2) sheath fibers obtained in a dual-step synthesis
process for sensing. These fibers were then utilized to host Au@BSA
clusters, which were further utilized to demonstrate the dual mode
sensing strategy using an analyte of large social relevance. We have
focused on the ability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to conjugate
with the nitro groups in trinitrotoluene for selective sensing.

Results
and Discussion
Structural and Morphological Characteristics
Unidirectionally
aligned nanofibers were electrospun, as discussed before, with a parallel
plate collector12 modified for the use
of coaxial spinneret, as shown in Figure 1a. The parallel plate alignment of the ground
consists of two indium tin oxide (ITO) plates separated at a distance
of 2.5 cm. This alignment of the ground facilitates the collection
of a single nanofiber or multiple nanofibers as required. To deposit
a single nanofiber on the substrate, electrospinning was done for
2 s at 25 kV. Because of the short time duration, very few fibers
were deposited onto the ground. The fibers act as a bridge to connect
the space between the parallel plates. These fibers are then lifted
onto the substrate manually. These fibers are submerged in octane
overnight to remove the mineral oil and then carbonized at 350 °C
for 4 h. The fibers consisted of a CNT core and a porous SiO2 shell. The core size of the SiO2 layer is around 1–1.5
nm, as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements
(Figure S-1).

Figure 1 (a) Coaxial electrospinning
setup; (b) scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of a single fiber on the electrode assembly; inset shows
a single fiber at higher magnification; (c) Raman spectra of the fibers
(green trace: as-spun fiber before carbonization, violet trace: SiO2 fibers post carbonization, pink trace: CNTs@SiO2 fibers post carbonization); (d) X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the fibers,
(inset shows the Au@BSA cluster under visible and UV light); (e) matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization mass spectra (MALDI-MS) of BSA and Au@BSA;
and (f) excitation and emission spectra of the Au@BSA cluster.

The morphology of the as-prepared
and carbonized nanofibers was
analyzed using SEM, as shown in Figures S-2 and 1b, respectively. The inset of Figure 1b shows the fiber
at a higher magnification. The as-prepared fibers were ∼900
nm in diameter, whereas the carbonized fibers were in the range of
600–700 nm. Shrinking of the fibers post carbonization by 150–200
nm is attributed to the loss of solvents and the polymer during heating.
Raman spectra of the fibers at various stages were collected to understand
the chemical composition of the fibers, as depicted in Figure 1c. The green trace is of the
fibers before carbonization. The spectrum shows sharp peaks at 2950,
1740, and 640 cm–1, which can be attributed to aliphatic
C–H stretching, C=O stretching, and C=O deformation,
respectively. Multiple peaks in the range of 1450–1300 and
1200–1000 cm–1 arise due to C–H deformation
and C–C stretching, respectively. The peaks between 600 and
300 cm–1 arise due to C–H in- and out-of-plane
bending, and C–CH2 out-of-plane bending.33 The violet trace corresponds to only SiO2 fibers that are electrospun without the CNTs and subsequently
calcined at 350 °C. No characteristic Raman peaks were observed
in the spectrum, which might be because of the amorphous nature of
SiO2 in the fiber. As the Raman is collected post calcination,
the peaks arising from the polymer poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) are
not present. The pink trace is of the carbonized CNTs@SiO2 fiber mat. These show the characteristic D and G bands that correspond
to the carbon nanotubes in the fiber. The XRD spectra in Figure 1d of the fibers show
a prominent wide peak at 22° that corresponds to amorphous silica.
As the concentration of CNTs is too low compared to that of SiO2, no features of CNTs are visible. The photographs in the
inset of Figure 1d
correspond to the Au@BSA cluster in visible and UV light. The red
luminescence of the cluster under UV light is stable. Figure 1e shows the MALDI-MS of the
parent BSA protein and Au@BSA cluster. BSA shows a peak at 66.7 kDa,
whereas the peak at around 72 kDa is attributed to the cluster indicating
the formation of the Au30@BSA cluster. Figure 1f shows the excitation and
emission spectra of the cluster. The excitation peak at 320 nm and
the emission peak at 630 nm also confirm the cluster formation. All
of these data are in accordance with the previous reports.18

Electrical Characteristics
For characterizing
the electrical
properties of the nanofiber, substrates with single nanofibers were
probed. To understand the difference in the current conduction before
and after the cluster treatment, I–V studies of SiO2 fibers and CNTs@SiO2 fibers pre- and post-treatment were conducted and the data are plotted
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 I–V characteristics of
fibers before and after treatment with Au@BSA cluster. (a) SiO2 fibers and (b) CNTs@SiO2 fibers.

Figure 2a shows
the I–V curve of silica fibers
in the absence and presence of clusters. In the case of SiO2 fibers, before the cluster treatment, the fibers do not show any
current. Even though the fibers are SiO2–carbon
composites, the core is hollow and the carbon content in the shell
as compared to silica is too low, which leads to high resistance,
characteristic of amorphous silica. Coating the fiber with PPCs increases
the current slightly, although still in the insulating regime. This
slight increase can be attributed either to the proteins in the cluster
which is on the surface and surrounding the fiber or the Na+ ions present in the cluster solution. The absence of a conduction
pathway hinders the movement of the charge carriers, leading to a
low current.

In Figure 2b, the
violet trace shows the I–V curve of CNTs@SiO2 fiber. The fibers show current in
the range of 500–600 nA at an applied voltage of 10 V. This
proves that the core–shell fibers are conducting in nature.
Fluctuations of the current in the above-mentioned range might be
because of the variations in the loading of CNTs in each fiber. The
presence of carbon in the outer shell of the fiber from the polymeric
backbone and the pores in the silica are expected to provide a transduction
pathway for electrons to flow to the CNTs in the core, thus providing
a linear current. The pink trace corresponds to the I–V curve of the same fibers after they have
been treated with Au@BSA and washed subsequently. An increase of more
than two times is observed in the current of the functionalized fibers
as compared to that of its precursor, with the current being in the
range of 1.4 μA. The diameter of the protein-protected cluster
is ∼5 nm; hence, the possibility of its penetration through
the silica shell and direct interaction with the core is ruled out.
The increase in current may be attributed to a combination of electron
hopping from the cluster to the CNTs and the presence of free Na+ ions on the surface of the fiber.

CNTs are well known
to act as electron acceptors in a conducting
system, whereas the PPCs can act as electron donors. The presence
of carbon in the shell, although minimal, might play a role in providing
a transduction pathway for electron transfer from the cluster to the
core. The chemical pathway of the formation of protein-protected clusters
has been studied and release of proteins during the synthesis process
has been established.16 The conduction
of electricity by proteins is a known phenomenon although investigations
are still underway to determine the exact factors responsible. Specifically,
BSA has a semiconducting nature with activation energy of 2 eV,34 which is close to the activation energy of CNTs.35 Coating BSA on the fiber shows a high current,
as shown in Figure S-3, although the current
is not stable and decreases substantially in repetitive cycles. In
contrast to this, the fibers coated with Au@BSA cluster exhibit a
moderate current that is highly stable, as given in Figure S-4. A reasonable conjecture is to assume that the
presence of gold cluster in the proteins decreases its activation
energy while increasing the inherent conductivity and thus regulating
the proton transfer, leading to the observation of a stable current.
This conjecture is backed by a decrease in current of the system in
presence of TNT as the nitro groups of TNT bind to the amino groups
in BSA, decreasing the charge carriers in the system (explanation
provided later). The other possibility for the increasing current
might be the presence of Na+ and Cl– ions
that are supplied from the cluster, although the literature suggests
that even in the presence of such ions, the conductivity in proteins
is predominantly due to mobile protons.36 The stability of the cluster-coated fiber has been checked up to
48 h, and no decrease in the I–V characteristics was noted, as represented in Figure S-5.

Sensing Experiment
Sensitivity of
Au@BSA clusters toward
TNT has been explained by the formation of a Meisenheimer complex
between the nitro group of the TNT and the free amino groups present
in BSA.37 This was also established by
the change in the photoluminescence profile of the Au@BSA cluster
after the addition of TNT, as shown in Figure S-6. Intense scattering from the silica fibers caused interference
in the measurement of the photoluminescence spectrum of the composite.
The physisorption of the cluster on the fiber enables them to detect
TNT in both solution and the vapor phase. For the solution phase experiments,
2.5 μL of the analyte was introduced onto the luminescent fiber
and luminescence quenching was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope.
The dependence of the fiber sensitivity toward the concentration of
TNT, acetonitrile, and its response to another commonly utilized explosive
material is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Optical and fluorescence images of the fibers in presence of various
analytes.

In Figure 3, images
(a–e) correspond to the optical images of the cluster-coated
fiber before the introduction of the analyte. The (a1–e1) images
are the fluorescence images of the fiber/fibers before the introduction
of the analyte, whereas the (a2–e2) images are the fluorescence
images taken a few seconds after the analyte has been introduced. Figure 3a2–c2 corresponds
to the luminescence quenching of the fiber at varying concentrations
of TNT, ranging from 1 ppt to 100 ppb. It can be seen that at 100
ppt and above, complete luminescence quenching is observed at 1 ppt,
although not completely quenched, a noticeable level of decrease was
noticed.

The number of TNT molecules required to bring about
the quenching
in Figure 3a2 is calculated
to be 119, when the fiber length is taken to be 40 μm, as per
the calculation shown in S-7. Figure 3d2 shows the fiber’s
response to 100 ppm of RDX. Although the concentration taken is very
high as compared to TNT, the decrease in luminescence intensity is
miniscule. As the TNT was dissolved in acetonitrile, to prove that
the luminescence quenching was happening due to the TNT molecules
and not due to solvent, a control experiment in which acetonitrile
was introduced to the cluster-coated fibers is shown in Figure 3e2. No change in luminescence
was observed proving that the solvent plays no role in the quenching
mechanism.

For the vapor phase experiments, the setup consisted
of the inverted
substrate utilized as a lid for the container containing the analyte,
kept in a sand bath. This was to ensure that the fibers are in direct
contact with TNT vapor when an external temperature of 70 °C
was applied, as shown in Figure 4. Another added advantage of the setup was that the
same fiber being exposed to vapor was extended onto another set of
electrodes on the substrate outside the exposure zone. Hence, the
same fiber has both analyte-exposed and unexposed areas for which I–V studies can be done and variations
in current at these positions were compared. The graph in Figure 4 shows the difference
in the conductivity of the fiber at the exposed and unexposed zones
with clear visible decrease in the current conduction where the fiber
has come in contact with TNT.

Figure 4 Schematic of setup for vapor-sensing experiments.
Inset shows the
fiber on the electrodes which is probed for I–V studies and the current variation with exposure to TNT.

Figure 5a1 shows
the fluorescence image of the cluster-coated fiber. Figure 5a2 shows the fluorescence image
of the same fiber, as shown in Figure 5a1, after exposure to TNT vapor for 30 s. Complete
luminescence quenching is noted when the cluster-coated fibers are
exposed to TNT vapor. Figure 5c shows the change in current of the fiber with varying exposure
times (30–300 s) of TNT vapor. When exposed to the TNT vapor,
within 30 s, the inherent current of the fiber decreases to about
half of the initial value and with increasing exposure time, the conductivity
of the fiber was lost and it reached the insulator regime. The exposure
measurements were done taking the fiber length as 1 mm, on the basis
of the channel width and because the approximate diameter of the fiber
was known from SEM measurements, the area of exposure could be calculated.

Figure 5 Exposure
to TNT vapor: fluorescence measurements of the fibers
(a1) before exposure, (a2) after 30 s exposure, (b) I–V measurements of the fibers with varying
time.

Assuming that the cluster forms
a monolayer covering on the fiber,
the number of TNT molecules required for Meisenheimer complexation
to occur between TNT and BSA in the exposed region is about 109, whereas the number of TNT molecules present in the container
at a temperature of 70 °C is about 1012. Thus, adequate
molecules are present for the reaction to happen. Detailed calculations
are given in S-8. The number of molecules
required for sensing to happen can be further decreased by modifying
the interelectrode distance. The decrease in the fiber current intensity
does not happen instantaneously but with increase in the exposure
time, which might be attributed to the excess cluster present on the
fiber surface. The nanoporous surface of the fiber facilitates the
diffusion of the vapors38 inside the fiber,
allowing Meisenheimer complex formation to occur, leading to high
sensitivity. Although there is a significant decrease in the current
after TNT exposure, exposing the fiber to air afterward for a few
hours allows the fiber to regain the conductivity to that before the
cluster treatment, as can be seen in Figure S-9. The specificity of the fiber was analyzed by comparing it with
the closest analogue of TNT, namely 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Fluorescence
imaging shows the change in the fluorescence of the fibers after exposing
the fibers to DNT vapors for 30 s. The quenching is substantial although
a trace level of cluster luminescence can still be observed while
using conductance measurements; current decrease in the fiber when
exposed to DNT was approximately 50% after 5 min (Figure S-10) compared with the same depletion within 30 s
in presence of TNT.

Meisenheimer complex formation happens between
the electron withdrawing
groups and nucleophiles, i.e., electron donating groups. The increase
in electrical conductivity of cluster-coated fibers is attributed
to the conducting nature of the proteins, mostly aromatic amino acids.
Exposure of the fiber to TNT brings about the interaction of amino
acids with the nitro groups. Nitro groups being electron withdrawing
groups form adducts with the amino acids, leading to a decrease in
the charge carriers of the fiber, leading to an overall decrease in
the electrical conductivity of the fiber. A schematic representing
the formation of the Meisenheimer complex in our system is given in Figure S-11.

Conclusions
In
the present article, we introduce the functional ability of
protein-protected clusters to act as conductivity sensors along with
them being utilized as luminescence sensors. Hosting these clusters
on dielectric porous shell nanofibers with conducting cores allows
qualitative and quantitative measurements to be done with high precision,
both in solution and in the vapor phase. In the solution phase, TNT
can be detected down to 1 ppt at room temperature, whereas in the
vapor phase, 4.8 × 109 molecules of TNT can be sensed
using a 1 mm fiber. The cluster-immobilized fibers show high sensitivity
and specificity to TNT in vapor phase; when further developed these
can be used as disposable sensors for TNT in point-of-use devices.

Synthesis
of Au@BSA Cluster
The Au@BSA nanoclusters
with red luminescence were prepared following a reported method18 by adding aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (10 mL, 6 mM) to BSA (10 mL, 25 mg/mL in water) under vigorous stirring
for 5 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted to around 11.0 with

Microtek Summit 11000 M probe station.

Preparation of SiO2 and MWCNTs@SiO2 Fibers
For the preparation
of SiO2 fibers, a reported method39 was followed utilizing coaxial electrospinning.
For the shell solution, TEOS (3.66 mL) was hydrolyzed by adding ethanol
(3.26 mL) to TEOS under vigorous stirring for 1 h. To the solution,
HCl (0.06 mL) was added and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently deionized
water (1.81 mL) was added to the solution and left for stirring overnight.
To this solution, PVAc (1.75 g) was added and stirred further for
4 h.

The above-mentioned solution was taken in the outer syringe
and mineral oil was taken in the inner syringe of the coaxial setup.
MWCNTs@SiO2 fibers were obtained by the addition of MWCNTs
to the mineral oil in the inner syringe of the coaxial spinneret.
MWCNTs will be referred to as CNTs throughout the text. The coaxial
spinneret consists of the core needle size of 18 G. The shell solution
was fed at a rate of 1.2 mL/h and that of the core at 0.6 mL/h, with
an applied voltage of 25 kV. The tip-to-collector distance was set
to 10 cm. The as-spun fibers were collected on parallel indium tin
oxide (ITO) plates separated by 2.5 cm gap and manually transferred
to electrodes patterned on glass or silicon wafer and immersed in
octane for 12 h to remove mineral oil existing in the core of the
as-spun fibers. The fibers were dried and subsequently carbonized
at 350 °C for 4 h to remove remaining mineral oil (ignition temperature
∼230 °C) solvents and to carbonize the polymer present.

Preparation of SiO2@Au@BSA and CNTs@SiO2@Au@BSA
Fibers
For the preparation of Au@BSA-coated SiO2 fibers, the cluster solution was drop cast on the substrate
containing the fibers and left for 15 min. The substrates were then
washed with water and dried at room temperature for 3 h and used.
The same protocol was followed to obtain CNTs@SiO2@Au@BSA
fibers.

Electrode Fabrication
The gold electrodes on the silicon
wafer were patterned using photolithography, which was preceded by
washing of the silicon substrate in hot acetone, followed by boiling
isopropanol
(IPA) and then rinsed with deionized (DI) water. Electrodes were obtained
using a lift-off process. The wafer was then blow dried and stored
in vacuum for further use. The gold electrodes were 100 μm wide,
with a thickness of 120 nm. The interelectrode distance was 20 μm.
These electrodes were utilized mostly for SEM measurements.

For most of the experimental purposes, ITO electrodes on glass substrates,
henceforth referred to as the substrates, were utilized, as transparency
of glass was crucial for fluorescence experiments. For the fabrication
of these electrodes, an ITO-coated glass slide was cleaned by blowing
air and then patterned using lithography. ITO was etched using dilute
HCl for about 10 min. The substrate was then washed in boiling acetone,
then IPA, followed by rinsing in DI water and dried by blowing air
and finally stored in vacuum till required. The electrodes were of
300 μm width and 150 nm height. The distance between the two
electrodes was 1 mm that acted as the channel.

Fluorescence
Sensing Experiment
For the single fiber
sensing experiment, we placed the cluster-coated fiber under the microscope.
About 2.5 μL of the analyte solution was added on the fiber.
Fluorescence images of the fiber were taken before and after addition
of the analyte.

Conductance Sensing Experiment
For
the conductance
measurements, the fiber was placed in a probe station. The probes
utilized are gold-coated tungsten, with a tip diameter of 20 μm.

Vapor-Based Experiments
The fiber-containing substrate
was placed at the mouth of the beaker in which the analyte was placed.
The beaker was subsequently heated to 70 °C by placing it in
a sand bath. The substrate was then removed as required and kept in
a sealed environment to minimize air exposure. A detailed explanation
of the setup with a schematic is provided in Results
and Discussion.
