A compressible microporous polymer
monolith (MPM) was prepared
by performing the Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction between 1,4-diiodobenzene
and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in a gel state without stirring. MPM was
functionalized via the click reaction with 1,3,5-tris(azidomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene
and 2,6-diethynylpyridine. MPM showed superhydrophobicity but became
hydrophilic after the click reaction. The functionalized MPM (F-MPM)
had polar triazole groups generated by the click reaction, which were
used as coordination sites for Co(II) ions. Cobalt nanoparticles were
loaded to F-MPM through in situ reduction of coordinated Co(II) ions
to produce a monolithic Co heterogeneous catalyst (Co-MPM). The microscopic
study showed that MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM consisted of fiber bundles,
together with spherical particles on the micrometer scale. Co-MPM
was used for tandem catalysis. Co-MPM promoted the reaction of dehydrogenation
of ammonia borane and hydrogenation of nitro compounds in one pot
to give amine products. The reactions with the compression and release
process were much faster compared with the reactions performed under
the stirring conditions, suggesting that the repeated compression
and release facilitated interfacial contact between the reactants
and active sites in Co-MPM.

1 Introduction
Microporous
organic polymers (MOPs) have been considerably studied
as catalyst supports in recent years.1−5 As supporting materials, MOPs have advantages associated with the
flexibility in their structural design compared with other porous
solids such as porous carbon and oxides. MOPs with highly cross-linked
structures are generally prepared by step-reactions of multifunctional
monomers. Because a variety of synthetic methods are available for
the preparation of MOPs including the transition metal-mediated coupling
reactions6−8 and other condensation reactions,9,10 MOPs
have a wide range of chemical and physical properties. They can be
further modified by postreactions to have tuned functionalities. The
suitably adjusted interactions between catalytically active species
and the supports have a significant influence in enhancing the stability
and performance of the heterogeneous catalysts.11−14

Herein, we present the
synthesis of a cobalt heterogeneous catalyst
supported on a compressible and hydrophilic microporous polymer monolith
(MPM). The Co heterogeneous catalyst sequentially promoted the dehydrogenation
of ammonia borane and the reduction of nitro compounds in an aqueous
environment. Ammonia borane with a high hydrogen density is an attractive
chemical hydrogen storage material. The catalytic dehydrogenation
of ammonia borane has been considered as a promising hydrogen generation
process under mild conditions. Various metal nanoparticles including
Pt, Rh, Ru, Pd, and Co exhibited catalytic activity in the hydrogen
release.15 For example, Ma et al. reported
that Co/CoO nanoparticles dispersed in an N-doped porous carbon facilitated
the release of hydrogen from ammonia borane in the tandem reactions
of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation.16

The monolithic microporous polymer support was prepared via
the
Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling reaction of triethynyl
benzene and diiodobenzene. A series of microporous polymers were previously
reported by the reaction of triethynyl benzene with aromatic halides,
but they were usually isolated as precipitated solids.17−19 We were able to obtain the monolithic microporous polymer by performing
the reaction in a gel state without stirring.20−22 The post-click
reaction of the polymer monolith provided hydrophilicity as well as
coordination sites for Co(II) ions. Cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs)
were incorporated into the polymer monolith by an in situ reduction
method.23,24

2 Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
synthetic processes of a MPM, functionalized MPM by the post-click
reaction (F-MPM), and Co NP-incorporated MPM (Co-MPM). MPM was prepared
via the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction of 1,4-diiodobenzene
and 1,3,5-triethynyl benzene in a 20 mL vial. The molar ratio between
the halogen and the ethynyl groups was set to be 1:1.5, so that MPM
had enough terminal alkynes for the click reaction. The reaction was
carried out at room temperature without stirring.21 The reaction mixture became a viscous gel in 5 min (Figure S1). The cross-linked polymer was isolated
as a monolith after 24 h. MPM was functionalized by the click reaction
with 1,3,5-tris(azidomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene and 2,6-diethynylpyridine.
The click reaction generated triazole groups, which had good ability
to complex with metal ions.25−29 The incorporation of Co NPs into F-MPM proceeded in two steps. At
first, an aqueous solution of cobalt chloride hexahydrate was absorbed
to F-MPM, and then the monolith was allowed to contact an aqueous
sodium borohydride solution through the compression and release process.
The click reaction also greatly improved the water wettability of
the monolith. MPM consisted only of hydrocarbons and showed a superhydrophobic
property with a water contact angle (WCA) of 151°. After the
click reaction, the surface of the monolith became hydrophilic, showing
WCAs of 0° because of the presence of triazole groups (Figure S2).30,31 We previously
used a fluorinated MOP monolith as a catalyst support,20 but the poor water wettability was a problem
for its application in an aqueous reaction. The polymer monoliths,
MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM had cylindrical shapes which were complementary
to the shape of the reactor (Figure S2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM
The structures of the polymer monoliths were characterized
by Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) and solid-state 13C CP/TOSS
NMR spectroscopy. MPM showed the absorption bands at 2207 and 3298
cm–1, corresponding to the stretching vibration
of C–C triple bonds and the C–H stretching vibration
of terminal alkynes, respectively (Figure 1a). In the spectrum of F-MPM, the characteristic
band of triazole rings showed up around 1450 and 1600 cm–1.32 There still appeared the bands corresponding
to terminal alkynes at 3298 cm–1 and azido groups
at 2093 cm–1, suggesting that some functional groups
did not participate in the click reaction.32,33 The solid-state 13C NMR spectrum of MPM showed aromatic
carbon peaks at 131 and 123 ppm and an acetylene carbon peak at 90
ppm (Figure 1b). The
spectrum of F-MPM exhibited an additional peak at 146 ppm, corresponding
to triazole ring carbons.34 The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of Co-MPM showed the presence of
Co along with nitrogen, which was not observed in the spectrum of
MPM (Figure S3).

Figure 1 (a) FT-IR and (b) 13C solid-state CP/TOSS NMR spectra
of MPM and F-MPM.

The formation of Co NPs
was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis. The XRD patterns of MPM and F-MPM showed no discernible
peaks, indicating their amorphous structures (Figure S4a). In contrast, there appeared sharp peaks at 2θ
= 20.3° and 32.9° in the XRD pattern of Co-MPM, which corresponded
to the (111) and (220) planes of fcc Co, respectively.35 The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data (Figure S4b) demonstrated that the monoliths had
good thermal stability. The initial degradation temperature of MPM
was around 350 °C. After the postmodifications, the thermal resistance
was enhanced to give a higher char yield.

The polymer monoliths
had hierarchically porous structures. Micropores
and mesopores were originated from the highly cross-linked structures,
and macropores were produced by the solvent removal from the cross-linked
gels. Hierarchically porous structures have benefits in catalysis
applications because micropores and mesopores supply large surface
areas while macropores improve mass transport.36−38 The porosities
of the monoliths were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements at 77 K (Figure 2a). The polymer monoliths showed type I adsorption isotherms
with a high N2 uptake in the low relative pressure region
(P/Po < 0.01), implying
the existence of micropores. Type IV adsorption isotherms were observed
with hysteresis loops in the high relative pressure region, indicating
the existence of mesopores.39,40 The pore size distributions
of the polymer monoliths were determined by the nonlocal density functional
theory (NLDFT), which showed the existence of micropores and mesopores.
The total pore volumes of MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM were 0.63, 0.54,
and 0.41 cm3 g–1 and their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface areas were 882, 708, and 523 m2 g–1, respectively. After the postmodification reaction and the incorporation
of Co NPs, the surface areas of the monoliths decreased compared to
that of MPM mainly because of the increase in the weight per unit
volume.41

isotherms of MPM, F-MPM,
and F-MPM. (b) NLDFT pore size distributions of MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of MPM, F-MPM, and
Co-MPM showed fiber bundles, together with spherical particles on
the micrometer scale (Figure 3a–c). In the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images, individual fibers with diameters of hundreds nanometers could
be observed (Figure 3d–f). Overall, MPM showed a less well-defined fibrous structure
than the fluorinated MPM that was previously synthesized by the Sonogashira–Hagihara
coupling reaction between 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene.20 This result was attributable to the differences
in the solubility and the reactivity of the fluorinated and nonfluorinated
monomers. The TEM image of Co-MPM (Figures 3f and S5) exhibited
that the Co NPs were well-distributed in the polymer fibers and the
average size of Co NPs was 10.9 nm (Figure S5). When a solution of cobalt chloride hexahydrate in methanol was
absorbed to unfunctionalized MPM and reduced to Co NPs, most Co NPs
were removed during the purification process (Figure S6).

TEM images of MPM, F-MPM, and Co-MPM.

MPM showed good mechanical stability against compressive
stress.
When MPM was compressed to a strain of 40%, it rapidly recovered its
original shape upon the release of the stress (Figure S7). The maximum stress slightly decreased after 10
loading-unloading cycles to a strain of 40%, but the deformation was
still reversible (Figure 4). Co-MPM showed a higher compressive strength than MPM, suggesting
the reinforcement effect of Co NPs.

of MPM, F-MPM, and
Co-MPM (maximum strain = 40%). (b) Ten cycles of loading-unloading
test results of MPM (maximum strain = 40%).

Co is one of the earth abundant transition metals. Co NPs
have
been increasingly used as catalysts in diverse reactions including
hydrogenation, oxidation, and water splitting.42 In recent years, more attention has been paid to the high
catalytic activity of Co NPs to promote hydrogen production from hydrogen
sources because hydrogen has been considered as a clean energy carrier.15,43,44 We successfully used Co-MPM as
a tandem catalyst in the sequential dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
and the hydrogenation of nitro compounds (Scheme 2). A nitro compound was dissolved in a cosolvent
of water and methanol (3:2, v/v), and then, the solution was diluted
to 0.05–0.1 mM with water for the UV measurement. A piece of
Co-MPM with a cylindrical shape (150 mg) was immersed in the diluted
nitro compound solution with an excess amount of ammonia borane. Co-MPM
was manually compressed and released at a rate of 2 s per cycle using
a glass rod. The UV–vis absorption of the solution was measured
every 30 cycles (1 min) to monitor the progress of the reaction. For
comparison, the reactions with stirring and without stirring were
also carried out under the same conditions except that the sponge
was not compressed.

Scheme 2 Schematic Illustration of the Tandem Dehydrogenation
of Ammonia Borane
and Hydrogenation of Nitro Compounds
Figure 5a shows
UV–vis spectra of the 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) solution measured
during the reaction with the compression and release process. The
reaction solution showed an absorption maximum at 400 nm because of
the formation of 4-nitrophenolate. The absorption intensity at 400
nm decreased rapidly with the concomitant increase of the peak corresponding
to the presence of 4-aminophenol at 296 nm, indicating that Co-MPM
catalyzed the tandem dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and hydrogenation
of 4-NP. The reaction was 5.5 times faster compared with the reaction
performed under the stirring conditions and 7.5 times faster than
the reaction under the static conditions when determined based on
the UV absorption change at 400 nm (Figures 5b,c and S8). Apparently,
the repeated compression and release facilitated interfacial contact
between the reactants and active sites in Co-MPM. Co-MPM maintained
the catalytic activity even after 5 times run without any significant
loss (Figure S9).

Figure 5 UV–vis spectral
changes of the 4-NP solution (initial concentration
= 0.1 mM) with reaction time: (a) reaction with the compression and
release process, (b) reaction with stirring, and (c) reaction without
stirring.

Nitrobenzene and nitroaniline
were also reduced to the corresponding
amines by the tandem reaction catalyzed by Co-MPM. Figure S10 shows UV–vis spectral changes measured during
the reactions, where the absorption peak intensity of a nitro compound
decreases and a new amine peak appears as the reaction proceeds.45,46 As observed in the reaction of 4-NP, the reactions of nitrobenzene
and nitroaniline with the compression and release process were much
faster than the reactions performed under the stirring and static
conditions.

3 Conclusions
A compressible MPM was
prepared by performing the Sonogashira–Hagihara
reaction in a gel state without stirring. The superhydrophobic surface
of the monolith was functionalized via the alkyne–azide cycloaddition
click reaction, which provided hydrophilic coordination sites for
Co(II) ions. The Co NP-incorporated polymer monolith was prepared
by an in situ reduction method and was applied to the tandem dehydrogenation
of ammonia borane and hydrogenation of nitro compounds. The rate of
the tandem reaction was significantly accelerated when the catalyst
was compressed and released during the reaction. Because a solid support
can prevent direct contact between active sites, catalytic metal NPs
supported on monolithic MOPs can be promising candidates for use in
tandem catalysis.

1,4-Diiodobenzne
(330 mg, 1 mmol), 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (150 mg, 1 mmol), and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (35 mg, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved
in a cosolvent of toluene and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (9 mL, 2:1,
v/v). The solution was transferred to a 20 mL vial and then degassed
by bubbling with nitrogen. A solution of CuI (9 mg, 0.05 mmol) in
a cosolvent of toluene and TEA (1 mL, 2:1, v/v) was added to the solution
in the vial quickly after degassing by bubbling with nitrogen. The
reaction mixture was left in the capped vial at room temperature for
24 h without stirring. The polymer monolith was taken out from the
vial and washed with methanol and acetone. After Soxhlet extraction
with tetrahydrofuran and drying in vacuo at 70 °C, MPM was obtained
as a yellowish monolith (240 mg).

4.4 Preparation

(240 mg) was immersed in the solution, and then, a solution of CuI
(9 mg, 0.05 mmol) in a cosolvent of toluene and TEA (1 mL, 2:1, v/v)
was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out at
65 °C for 24 h. The polymer monolith was washed with methanol

in vacuo at 70 °C, F-MPM was obtained as a brownish monolith.

4.5 Preparation of Co-MPM
Cobalt chloride

water, and then, the solution was absorbed to F-MPM (325 mg). An excess
amount of an aqueous sodium borohydride solution (50 mM, 40 mL) was
added to the mixture of F-MPM. After 1 h at room temperature, the
polymer monolith was isolated and washed with methanol and deionized
water. After Soxhlet extraction with methanol and drying in vacuo
at 70 °C, Co-MPM was obtained as a black monolith.
