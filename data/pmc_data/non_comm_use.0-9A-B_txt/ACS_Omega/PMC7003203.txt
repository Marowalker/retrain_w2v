The chemical synthesis of cyclic
peptides is a well-established
area of research. This has been further expanded by development of
bio-orthogonal reactions that enable access to peptides of greater
structural complexity. One approach utilizes 1,3-dichloroacetone to
selectively link free cysteine side-chains with an acetone-like bridge
via an SN2 reaction. Here, we have used this reaction to
dimerize cyclic peptide monomers to create novel bicyclic dimeric
peptides. We investigated a range of reaction parameters to identify
the optimal dimerization conditions for our model systems. One of
the acetone-linked dimeric peptides was analyzed for proteolytic stability
in human serum and was observed to still be fully intact after 48
h. This study provides valuable insights into the application of 1,3-dichloroacetone
as a tool in the synthesis of complex, multicyclic peptides.

Introduction
A common phenomenon
observed in proteins is their ability to self-associate
to form dimers.1 We can mimic this phenomenon
using peptide mimetics whereby we replicate specific loops of proteins,
cyclize them, then tether them together. Dimerization of peptides
has long been considered to be a viable strategy to increase binding
affinity, potency, and/or resistance to inactivation for peptide agonists2−4 and antagonists.5 Several ligation strategies
have been adopted to dimerize peptides, such as disulfide bond formation,
which is a common structural element found in naturally occurring
peptides.6−8 However, disulfide bonds are highly sensitive to
reducing conditions9,10 and can readily form mixed disulfide
isomers via thiolysis.11−13 Amide linkages are more resistant to reduction, but
carboxylates and amines are extremely common in peptides, therefore,
orthogonal side-chain protection strategies are usually required to
achieve site-specific conjugation.

A range of bio-orthogonal
ligation chemistries have been developed,
including the copper(II)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
(“click” chemistry),14 the
strain-promoted copper-free click reaction,15,16 Diels–Alder cycloadditions between tetrazines and strained
alkenes or alkynes,17,18 and photoactivated 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reactions.19 However, these
reactions require incorporation of often expensive, non-natural functional
groups. This is undesirable in drug discovery programs because high
production costs of lead compounds can limit their scalability, and
the toxicity of metabolites derived from chemically diverse peptides
is often unknown. In this environment, efficient, economical, and
biocompatible ligation chemistries are essential.

With the prominence
of cystine in many naturally occurring peptides
of interest (e.g., cyclotides, venoms)20,21 and their
application as conformational constraints in medicinal chemistry research,4,22 we have long been interested in utilizing cysteine as the conjugation
point for dimer formation. There are numerous reports whereby cysteine
has been utilized for macrocyclization or cross-coupling of peptides,
with numerous “linker” strategies available.23−25 We initially explored disulfide bonds as an option but always considered
the possibility of bond reduction and disulfide shuffling. Given our
interest in applying a coupling technique to form bicyclic homodimeric
peptides, we scoured the literature for a reaction that was inexpensive,
rapid, and would provide symmetry between the two cyclic monomers
of the dimer. To that end, we have evaluated the recently reported
SN2 reaction26 between thiolates
and 1,3-dichloroacetone (DCA) and utilized it to form dimers from
several cyclic peptide monomers.

As a bifunctional thiol reactive
agent, DCA has long been used
as a protein cross-linker27−29 and, more recently, been applied
to peptide macrocyclization26 (Figure 1). It can be used
to form an acetone-like “bridge” via thioether formation
to create a peptide macrocycle, where it was found to stabilize an
α-helical structure.26 We hypothesized
that DCA would be an ideal reagent to efficiently form a stable “bridge”
between two cyclic peptides and enable the rapid preparation of homodimeric
cyclic peptides. Furthermore, this reaction does not require non-naturally
occurring amino acids, and it can be conveniently performed in aqueous
buffer. The carbonyl group in the tether also affords a chemoselective
handle via oxime ligation to enable site-specific labeling and the
formation of higher order oligomers.26 Herein,
we demonstrate the utility of the DCA reaction by dimerizing several
backbone-cyclized peptides. To ascertain optimal reaction conditions,
we studied its chemoselectivity and several reaction parameters: stoichiometry,
concentration, temperature, pH, and buffer.

of DCA for peptide cyclization.26 aa =
any amino acid; C = cysteine—the
amino acid side-chain has been explicitly included; TCEP = tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.

Results and Discussion
To examine
the utility of DCA as a peptide dimerizing agent, we
designed and synthesized cyclic peptides 1a to 6a (Figure 2 and Table 1). These
cyclic peptides are loosely based on sequences found in the neurotrophin
family of neurotrophic factors, and the ligand-gated purinoceptor
ion channel P2X7.4,30,31 As a group, they have different ring sizes (five to eleven residues)
and variation in the number of lysine residues (zero to three; Table 1), to determine whether
the ε-amino group competes with the β-thiolate of cysteine
for DCA.262a was synthesized
to specifically evaluate the impact that omitting lysine has on dimerization
yields. As a proof-of-concept peptide, 2a was only tested
in selected conditions and reaction products were not isolated.

Synthesis
of Cyclic Monomer Peptides
1a–5a were
synthesized using our previously reported approach30,32 (Scheme 1), which
involves assembly of the peptide chain on 2-chlorotrityl resin via
solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), cleavage of the protected peptides
from the solid support, backbone cyclization, and global deprotection.
Importantly, no significant epimerization was observed during cyclization
of these peptides. This was to be expected for 3a–5a as the C-terminal amino acid in the linear precursor was a Gly residue.
Furthermore, we have previously observed with analogues of 1a and 2a no evidence of significant epimerization of
C-terminal arginines (unpublished data). All peptides were isolated
in good yield (12–27% overall yield, >95% purity) using
reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Cyclic
Monomer, 1a–5a using 1a as Exemplar
Amino acids are represented by
one-letter codes in a circle; 2CTC resin = 2-chlorotrityl chloride
resin; p = D-Pro; SPPS = solid-phase peptide synthesis; DIEA = N,N-diisopropylethylamine; HATU = 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid
hexafluorophosphate; DODT = 3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol. Assembly
of the linear peptides and the cyclization step uses dimethylformamide
(DMF) as the solvent.

6a is sequentially
similar to 3a, 4a, and 5a but
lacks proline in its sequence,
which can promote cyclization. Therefore, we employed native chemical
ligation (NCL), which does not require the presence of bulky side-chain
protecting groups that can hinder cyclization. C-terminal peptide
hydrazides were prepared and subsequently oxidized to the reactive
acyl azide, followed by thioesterification to form the critical thioester
moiety that is essential for the reaction to proceed (Scheme 2).336a was assembled on a hydrazine resin, then cleaved
with trifluoroacetyl (TFA) to yield the linear peptide hydrazide.
Head-to-tail cyclization via NCL was then performed to produce 6a. However, trace amounts of 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid
(MPAA) were also present in the crude peptide mixture, which coeluted
with the parent peptide during the purification step. This necessitated
multiple HPLC purifications and resulted in a lower-than-expected
yield (6% yield). It is essential that all traces of MPAA are removed
prior to dimerization because its thiol group can compete with the
peptide for DCA. For this reason, we recommend that NCL is not the
preferred method of peptide cyclization for this application (although
other thiol reagents could have been used to avoid the side-product
we observed here23,24).

Synthesis of Dimeric Peptides
Synthesis
of the peptide
dimers was achieved via adaptation of a previously reported method;26 although, notably the peptide concentration
was increased from 0.1 mM in the literature to 4 mM (Scheme 3). All monomeric peptides were
incubated with 1.1 equiv tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in 50
mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) for 15 min, before
the first aliquot of 0.275 equiv of DCA was added. Each reaction proceeded
for 30 min before a second 0.275 equiv of DCA was added. Reactions
were monitored by reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(RP-LCMS) at the following time-points: 15 min after the addition
of TCEP (t = 0), 30 min after the first DCA addition
(t = 30 min), and 30 min after the second DCA addition
(t = 1 h). Reaction monitoring RP-LCMS data appears
in Figure S1. The conditions described
above will from this point be referred to as condition 1 (Table 2).

Scheme 3 Synthetic Scheme
of Dimeric Peptides Using Condition 1
Blue circles represent
cyclic
peptides bearing a single cysteine residue (side-chain explicitly
included).

Table 2 Conditions Investigated
for DCA Dimerization
Reaction and the Optimal Parameters Determined from the Resultsa
a Original condition (condition 1)
is shaded in light grey. Variables altered are shaded in dark grey.
All equivalents are relative to the starting monomer.

b Optimal parameters are compared
to those from condition 1, using LCMS to quantify success of each
reaction parameter assessed.

Using condition 1, all monomeric starting material (1a–6a) was consumed at t = 1 h, but notably the acetone-linked
dimer yields varied (Figure 3). Two common side products were detected for all six peptides.
Side product 1 (Figure 4A) had a mass of +56 Da compared with the monomeric peptides. We
initially thought that this was due to the presence of monochloroacetone
(MCA; Figure S2) in the DCA starting material,
which can be a side product that can form during DCA synthesis. However,
NMR analysis of our DCA found that there was no detectable MCA present
(Figure S3). We speculate that the MCA
is forming in situ, although the precise mechanism currently remains
unclear. Side product 2 is a TCEP-related adduct which is +304 Da
relative to the starting monomer (Table S1). A side product whereby one end of DCA was hydrolyzed (side product
3; Figure 4B) was observed
during formation of 6b. An MPAA adduct of this peptide
was also detected (vide supra).

Figure 3 Yield of each species at t = 1 h of the dimerization
reaction using condition 1. Identity of intermediate and side products 1–4 are also described in Table S1.

Figure 4 Suspected identities of (A) side product 1,
(B) side product 3,
(C) side product 4, and (D) the dimerization reaction intermediate.

As a negative control, the reaction was carried
out in the absence
of DCA, whereby 1a–6a were incubated in 50 mM
NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) with 1.1 equiv of TCEP
at 4 mM for 1 h. All monomers remained unreacted. This demonstrates
that disulfide bond formation was not a competing reaction, which
was not surprising due to the presence of the reductant TCEP. Subsequently,
the impact of each reaction parameter was investigated systematically
as listed in Table 2, based on condition 1.

Impact of Varying the Stoichiometry of TCEP
Peptide
precursors to be dimerized must be preincubated with TCEP to suppress
formation of disulfide-linked dimers via oxidation. The reaction was
performed without TCEP (condition 2) to investigate the impact of
a reductant-free reaction (Figure S4).
It was found that preincubation of TCEP is important for obtaining
good yields for most of the peptides except 3b and 5b. Side product 3 (Figure 4B) was found in condition 2 for all six peptides. Small
quantities of disulfide-linked dimers were also observed in condition
2 in most cases. Yields of 3b and 5b were
not notably affected by the absence of TCEP. Nevertheless, we recommend
utilizing TCEP, as the minor disulfide-linked product can be difficult
to separate from the desired dimer.

Impact of Varying the Stoichiometry
of DCA
We found
that it is preferable for DCA to be added to the reaction slowly and
not used in a large excess. In condition 1, 0.55 equiv of DCA was
added over two equal additions at 30 min increments. Subsequently,
conditions where 0.275, 0.55, and 1.1 equiv of DCA relative to the
starting monomer were all added simultaneously (conditions 3–5)
were also tested in 1a, 3a–6a (Figure S5). As expected, reactions were not complete
at t = 1 h with 0.275 equiv of DCA (condition 3)
as there was still starting monomer left unreacted. Interestingly,
the dimerization yields of condition 3 do not significantly differ
from the standard condition reaction, suggesting that most of the
desired product has formed using the first 0.275 equiv of DCA in the
standard condition reactions; the second aliquot mostly caused formation
of the side products that were observed using condition 1.

The
addition of a single quantity of either 0.55 equiv (condition 4) or
1.1 equiv of DCA (condition 5) into the reaction (especially the latter)
tended to decrease dimerization yields but the starting monomer had
reacted fully. It suggests that high concentrations of unreacted DCA
result in an increase in the side product formation, which verifies
the previous finding.

Impact of Varying the Starting Monomer Concentration
As expected, peptide concentration played an important role in
determining
the reaction outcome. The dimerization reaction was tested with peptide
monomers at 12 mM (condition 6), 1 mM (condition 7), and the standard
4 mM (condition 1; Figure S6). For all
six peptides, reactions progressed slowly when the starting monomer
concentration was increased, compared with the standard condition
(12 mM; condition 6), with a substantial quantity of starting monomer
still present (varied between 48 and 72%), and no more than 25% desired
acetone-linked dimer formed at t = 1 h. The monofunctionalized
DCA intermediate (intermediate; Figure 4D) was observed in condition 6. Minimal side product
was observed when starting monomer concentration is 12 mM, suggesting
that higher concentrations slow the reaction kinetics.

The 1
mM starting monomer concentration condition (condition 7) was tested
for all peptides except 2a. This low concentration favored
the production of side products 1 and 2 (Table S1), and therefore reduced the desired peptide dimer yield
of 1b and 3b–5b. However, the yield
of 6b increased from 60% (condition 1; 4 mM) to 72% at
1 mM. However, in general, using a 4 mM starting concentration of
monomer appears to be preferential for the DCA dimerization reaction.

Impact of Varying the Reaction pH
The pKa value of cysteine thiols is 8–934 and that of lysine amines is typically near 10.5,35 which indicates that chemoselectivity is achievable.
In addition to the originally reported pH 8.0 in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer, 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer
at a range of pH values (6.0, 7.0, and 9.0; conditions 8–10; Figure S7), and three other commonly used buffers
at their original pH (100 mM Na2CO3 at pH 11.3,
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and 0.1% TFA at pH 1.8;
conditions 11–13; Figure S8) were
tested in the dimerization reactions of 1a and 3a–6a. Based on the results from pH and buffer combinations
that we tested, we recommend carrying out the DCA dimerization reaction
at pH 7.0 in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer.

Performing
the reactions at pH 9.0 (condition 10) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 did not have a notable impact on the yield of desired peptide
dimers increase in side products. Reactions at pH 6.0 (condition 8)
were extremely slow and most starting monomers remained unreacted
at t = 1 h. A small proportion of intermediates were
observed at t = 1 h across the five peptides tested,
whereas none or only trace of the desired dimers was formed.

We observed a reduction in side products when the reaction was
carried out at pH 7.0 in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (condition
9), in the formation of 1b, 3b, 5b, and 6b. It is believed that this was due to protonation
of lysine amines at this pH, which decreased interference of the desired
reaction. However, dimer yields at t = 1 h were not
improved for most reactions compared to condition 1, with some monomer
peptides left unreacted or partially reacted. This is suspected to
be a result of incomplete deprotonation of cysteine thiols at this
pH. Nevertheless, although the dimer yield was not increased, reaction
at pH 7.0 improved the ratio of products to side products. We concluded
that pH 7.0 to 9.0 is a workable pH range for the DCA dimerization
reaction; within this range, pH 7.0 provides the highest purity of
the desired product, but requires a longer reaction time.

As
expected, reactions in 0.1% TFA (condition 13) progressed extremely
slowly, as cysteine thiols should be protonated at pH 1.8. However,
reactions were also slow in PBS, even though its starting pH (7.4)
is within the workable pH range that we had determined for 50 mM of
NH4HCO3. This is explained by the relatively
low buffer strength of PBS compared to 50 mM NH4HCO3. Indeed, when we measured the pH of PBS post-reaction, we
observed it was closer to pH 6.0, which would explain the similarity
of the reaction profiles between using PBS at pH 7.4 or 50 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 6.0.

Using 0.1% TFA or PBS both
slow the reaction kinetics with little
to no dimers observed after 1 h, and no side products were observed
in these conditions. Conversely, using 100 mM Na2CO3 at pH 11.3 (condition 11) gave not only drastically lower
yields compared to condition 1, but also resulted in a marked increase
in side products. In addition to the common side products seen in
condition 1, a hydrolyzed side product (side product 3) was also found
in the reactions of all but one of the peptides. Importantly, no DCA
adduct through lysine was observed even though the lysine amine was
expected to be deprotonated at this pH.

Our thorough investigation
of pH and buffer combinations served
to reinforce the report by Assem and colleagues that 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer was the optimum choice for the dimerization
reaction.26 However, we found that a pH
of 7.0 rather than 8.0 provided the highest purity of desired products
and is our recommendation when using DCA to dimerize peptides.

Impact
of Varying the Reaction Temperature
A reaction
temperature of 0 °C slowed down the reaction kinetics. However,
the lower temperature also served to improve yields by suppressing
the side product formation. In total, we tested three reaction temperatures
(0, 40, and 60 °C; conditions 14–16) for the dimerization
reaction in addition to room temperature (condition 1). 1a and 3a–6a were tested in all temperature conditions
and 2a using conditions 1 and 11 (Figure S9).

An increase in side product 1 (Figure 4A) with increased
reaction temperature was observed in all peptides tested. Side product
3 (Figure 4B) also
started to appear at the elevated temperature in some cases. For side
products 1 and 3, the dimerization yield decreased at high temperature
(conditions 15 and 16) for all peptides except peptide 6b, which at 40 °C yielded a comparable dimer (6b) to that obtained at room temperature; at 60 °C increased dimer
yield by 11%.

We observed that a reaction temperature of 0 °C
suppressed
the formation of side products, with improved yields for 1b, 2b, 4b, and 6b (particularly 1b and 6b), which were 8 and 14% higher, respectively,
relative to condition 1. Although the dimerization yield decreased
by 15% at t = 1 h when reacting 3a in
condition 14, 17% of the reaction intermediate was observed; yields
should improve with a longer reaction time. Likewise, utilizing condition
14 for 5a resulted in a 3% yield reduction at t = 1 h; 17% of reaction intermediate was also present.
These results suggest that reducing the reaction temperature can improve
the acetone-linked dimer yield. However, longer reaction times are
required.

Impact of Side-Chain Protection on Lysine
Assem and
colleagues speculated that the presence of lysine amines as alternative
nucleophiles could complicate reactions using DCA.26 We were mindful of this possibility and included peptides
in this study with multiple lysines to investigate this possibility.
However, we did not observe any lysine adduct in our results, suggesting
that the ε-amine does not participate in the reaction with DCA
using our conditions, but it may instead interfere with the desired
reaction of β-thiolate of cysteine with DCA in an indirect manner.
To test whether unprotected lysine is really an important factor affecting
the yield of acetone-linked dimers, we synthesized a version of 1a (Scheme 4) whereby an orthogonal side-chain protecting group on cysteine was
selectively removed using reducing conditions, leaving the side-chain
protecting groups of lysines and arginine intact.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Cyclic
Monomer Peptide 1a with Side-Chain
of Lysines Protected
Amino acids are represented by
one-letter codes in a circle; PPh3 = triphenylphosphine.

Semi-protected 1a was dimerized
using our standard
conditions (condition 1). Notably, we made one alteration and used
a 1:1 solution of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0 and
DMF to dissolve the hydrophobic peptide. We chose DMF as a cosolvent
because the DCA “stock” solution was also prepared in
DMF. A yield of 77% of acetone-linked dimer was obtained, which was
a 10% improvement of the dimerization step compared to using “unprotected” 1a (67%). Semi-protected 1b then underwent side-chain
deprotection in TFA to yield 1b. The results verify that
although DCA does not directly conjugate to lysine side-chains, unprotected
lysines can still appear to affect acetone-linked dimer yield. Protecting
the lysine side-chains is a potential way to improve dimerization
yields, especially for lysine-rich peptides. Importantly, this result
also demonstrated that the reaction was exclusively occurring via
the Cys residues, as the product from this synthesis of 1b and the first synthesis using deprotected 1a were characterized
and shown to have identical LCMS retention times and m/z.

In Vitro Serum Stability Assays
As we are particularly
interested in the possible utility of dimers linked via acetone-like
bridges as potential pharmacological tools, their stability in biological
fluids is critical. Thus, we chose to examine 3b in an
in vitro model of serum stability in a solution of human serum (Figure 5). In our assay,
there appeared to be no loss of 3b over a 48 h period.
To investigate if the acetone-like linkage itself has any impact on
peptide stability in serum, we synthesized and tested an analogous
disulfide-linked dimer 3c (Figure S10), which was found to also be intact over this 48 h period.
This demonstrates that the acetone-like linkage has no negative impact
on peptide stability in serum. In contrast, the linear control peptide
(substance P) was hydrolyzed completely within 3 h, with a half-life
of 72 min.

Figure 5 Stability of acetone-linked dimer peptide 3b, disulfide-linked
dimer peptide 3c, and a linear control peptide substance
P in human serum in vitro. Peptides (0.5 mg/mL) were incubated at
37 °C with human serum. The percentage of peptide remaining in
samples taken at various time points was determined by RP-HPLC, using
4-isopropylbenzyl alcohol as an internal standard.

It is well established that head-to-tail cyclized peptides
are
typically highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage.36 Our stability assays show that combining circular peptides
via the enzymatically and redox-stable acetone-like “bridge”
results in dimeric bicyclic peptides that are metabolically stable.
Metabolic stability is only one contributor—along with renal
excretion—to peptide half-life in vivo. Nevertheless, the stable
nature of acetone-linked cyclic dimers suggests that they could be
suitable for administration in vivo, either as pharmacological tools
or as lead compounds for preclinical development.

Conclusions
The utilization of DCA in combination with cysteine-bearing peptides
is an effective bio-orthogonal conjugation strategy for the synthesis
of dimeric bicyclic peptides. However, there are several aspects of
this reaction that need to be carefully considered. The key findings
of this study showed that DCA should be added to the reaction mixture
slowly to minimize the concentration of unreacted DCA, and thereby
minimize side product formation. Furthermore, pH and temperature are
also critical, with 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer at
pH 7.0 and 0 °C determined to be the optimal conditions. We note
that in peptides with multiple lysines, selective side-chain protection
strategies can be applied to shield lysine side chains during the
dimerization step.

In summary, DCA has proven to be a useful
addition to the peptide
synthesis toolkit and anticipate that it will become more commonly
utilized in the preparation of complex multicyclic peptides.

Experimental
Section
General Procedure A: Preparation of Fmoc-Amino Acid-Substituted
Resins
Fmoc protected C-terminal amino acid (2.0 equiv relative
to resin) was dissolved in DCM (10 mL/g of resin), followed by addition
of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA)
(6.0 equiv relative to resin) and 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. The
mixture was gently shaken for 4 h at room temperature. Unloaded sites
were then capped by 1 mL of methanol for 10 min. Afterwards, the loaded
resin was washed with DMF (5 × 10 mL), methanol (5 × 10
mL), and diethyl ether (5 × 10 mL) and dried in vacuo.

General
Procedure B: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis—Linear
Peptides
Peptides were synthesized on Fmoc-amino acid substituted
2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (see general method A) using standard
Fmoc protocols on a CEM Liberty automated microwave synthesizer. Fmoc-deprotections
were performed using 20% piperidine in DMF (2 × 5 mL, 5 min).
Couplings were performed using Fmoc-amino acids (0.2 M, dissolved
in DMF) and 0.45 M O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate, activating with 18% DIEA in DMF. Between successive
steps, the peptide resin was washed three times with DMF.

General Procedure
C: Peptide Cleavage from 2-Chlorotrityl Chloride
Resin
Peptide-resin was treated with 0.8% TFA in DCM (5 mL)
for 5 min at room temperature, shaking gently. The mixture was then
filtered, and the filtrate was collected into a flask containing 1:2
acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O (50 mL). The treatment with 0.8%
TFA solution was repeated an additional seven times. DCM in the filtrate
was removed in a rotary evaporator, and the remaining filtrate was
then lyophilized.

General Procedure D: Peptide Head-to-Tail
Cyclization
Linear side-chain-protected peptide was dissolved
in DMF or 500 μL
DMF and the remaining volume comprised ACN to give a peptide concentration
of 4 mM. Then, 6.0 equiv (relative to peptide) of DIEA and 3.0 equiv
(relative to peptide) of HATU were added to the peptide solution.
The mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 4 h. Reaction
progression was monitored by analytical RP-LCMS, and when complete,
the mixture was diluted in 1:1 ACN/H2O and lyophilized.

General Procedure E: Removal of Acid Sensitive Protecting Groups
on Peptide
To the peptide was added 5 mL of deprotection
solution (95% TFA, 2% H2O, 2% DODT, 1% TIPS), which was
stirred gently for 2 h at room temperature. The solution was concentrated
under a stream of N2 gas to ∼10% of the original
volume, and 15 mL cold ether was added to precipitate the peptide.
The reaction vessel was centrifuged (2500 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C),
and the ether was decanted to yield a residual solid. The peptide
was subsequently purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC (buffer
A was 0.1% v/v TFA in milli Q water, and buffer
B was 0.08% v/v TFA in acetonitrile).

In
Vitro Serum Stability Assay for Peptide 3b, 3c, and Substance P
Human serum from male AB plasma
(purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, H4522) in a capped Eppendorf tube was
incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a water bath, then mixed with
the peptide (dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of
0.5 mg/mL, along with 4-isopropylbenzyl alcohol (0.05% v/v) as an
internal standard. Aliquots (15 μL) were taken at t = 0 (taken immediately after mixing) and specified timepoints (substance
P: 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 min; peptide 3b/3c: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 h) when reaction tube was kept incubated

Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism, version 7.04.  

Instrumentation
LCMS was performed on an Agilent 1260
Infinity II system. The photodiode array detector HS (215 nm or unless
otherwise stated) coupled directly to an electrospray ionization source
and an Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass analyzer. Standard RP-HPLC
analysis was performed at 40 °C using an Agilent InfinityLab
Poroshell 120 EC-C8 3.0 × 50 mm 2.7 μm column, fitted with
an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 EC-C8 3.0 × 5 mm 2.7 μm guard
column. The column eluted with a gradient of 0–60% ACN in 0.05%
aqueous TFA over 9 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Mass spectra
were obtained in the positive mode with a scan range of 2–2000 m/z. Buffer A was 0.05% v/v TFA in milli Q water, and buffer B was 0.05% v/v TFA in acetonitrile. 

Identities of final products
were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra,
obtained using an Agilent MS Q-TOF (model G6545XT) using the (+)-ion
mode with a Dual AJS ESI ion source.

Analytical reverse-phase
HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1200
series HPLC system, fitted with an Eclipse XD8-C8 4.6 Å, 5 μm
column. Buffer A was 0.1% v/v TFA in milli Q
water, and buffer B was 0.08% v/v TFA in acetonitrile.
The column eluted with a gradient of 0–60% ACN in 0.08% aqueous
TFA over 10 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
