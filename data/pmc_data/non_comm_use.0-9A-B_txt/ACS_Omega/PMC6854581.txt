We
report synthesis of monodispersed, stable, and colloidal gold
nanoparticles (Au NPs) using anthocyanin-riched red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), strawberry (Fragaria
ananassa), and blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) extracts as functions of concentration of HAuCl4·3H2O and berries extract, reaction time, and reaction pH values
(pHs) and demonstrate their unique stability in highly concentrated
salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) solutions. The catecholamine group of
anthocyanin molecules give preferential coordination reaction with
gold ions (Au3+) for creating anthocyanin–Au3+ complexes, which may lead to initiation of nucleation for
seed formation, and then, oxidation of catecholamine results in a
flow of electrons from anthocyanins to Au seeds for anisotropic growth.
Finally, the surface of the Au NPs is saturated with anthocyanins,
and formation of monodispersed and stable Au NPs with narrow size
distribution is completed. We also report the effects of some experimental
parameters including concentrations of Au3+ ions and barrier
extracts, reaction time, and pHs on formation of the Au NPs with rational
explanations. The long-term colloidal stability of the Au NPs in the
400 mM NaCl solution was comparatively studied with commercial Au
NPs (citrate capped). As results show that anthocyanin-riched berry
extracts directed Au NPs we proposed here can be considered as promising
and safe tools for biomedical applications owing to their highly much
colloidal dispersibility and salt tolerance properties.

Introduction
Although synthesis
of uniform and monodispersed nanoparticles (NPs)
with unique intrinsic properties, including optical, magnetic, and
luminescence, is accomplished in organic solvents and surfactants
consisting of a long hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain at high temperature.
In terms of bioanalytical and biomedical application aspects,1−6 colloidal stability of NPs in the aqueous solutions and their toxicities
are the critical issues to be solved. It is worthy to mention that,
when hydrophobic NPs are directly applied to living organisms, they
are prone to rapid agglomeration owing to insolubility in aqueous
environment, which causes serious congestion in blood vessels and
may eventually lead to death. Therefore, it is necessary to produce
water-soluble NPs with low toxicity and high colloidal stability.

Until now, various biomolecules including protein, enzyme, and
DNA have been used as reducing and/or stabilizing agents to produce
colloidal and biocompatible NPs for using them in biomedicine. For
instance, while Kelley and co-workers developed a single designer
ligand chimeric DNA-directed colloidal and functional semiconductor
nanocrystals for targeted biological imaging, a similar strategy was
utilized by Tan and co-workers using double stranded DNA to synthesize
metallic silver (Ag), gold (Au), and copper (Cu) NP-decorated graphene
oxide nanocomposites as novel and effective antimicrobial agents.7−10 In addition to that, protein, folic acids, peptides, and enzymes
acted as functional ligands for production of quantum dots used as
biosensing and imaging tools.11 However,
major drawbacks of using these biomolecules are their high cost, risk
of easy contamination, easy degradation, and the need for special
storage condition. To address these issues, plant extracts are considered
as alternative reducing and stabilizing agents for biosynthesis of
metal and metal oxide NPs.

Up to date, different types of plant
extracts have been widely
utilized for formation of a variety of NPs because they are quite
cost-effective or even free, greatly stable against harsh experimental
conditions,12−23 easily prepared and they provide large scale production of NPs.
Plant extract-based NP synthesis was developed for the first time
by Shankar and co-workers using the lemongrass plant extracts for
formation of gold (Au) nanoprisms NPs.24 The polyphenols, flavonoids, sugars, and enzymes found in plant
extracts play a crucial role for the reduction of metal ions and formation
of NPs.

Among all metallic and metal oxide NPs, Au is apparently
the most
popular and used NP in various scientific fields owing to unique optical,
electronic, and chemical properties.25−29 The intrinsic localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) property of Au NPs enabled us to efficiently use them in biosensing,
bioimaging, delivery vehicle, and disease therapy.28−37 These properties directly depend on size, morphology, and monodispersity
of Au NPs. The established method for the Au NP synthesis called “Turkevich
method” used trisodium citrate as reducing and stabilizing
agents at the boiling point, and the Au NPs were produced approximately
in 1 h.38 In this protocol, not only trisodium
citrate but also the high temperature acts as a driving force for
thermal reduction of Au3+ ions as well.39 Herein, we report a systematic study on synthesis of colloidal
and stabile Au NPs using anthocyanin-riched raspberry, strawberry,
and blackberry extracts at room temperature (RT) in roughly 20 min.
We investigated formation of Au NPs as a function of the concentration
of Au3+ ions, barrier extract, reaction time, and pHs.
The salt tolerances of the anthocyanin-directed Au NPs and citrate
capped Au NPs were comparatively studied.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Anthocyanin-Directed Au NP
The anthocyanins,
water-soluble, natural, and phenolic pigments, predominantly found
in many colorful plants, especially in raspberry, strawberry, and
blackberry are responsible for the coloring of these fruits. In these
fruits, the cores of anthocyanins can be varied to pelargonidin-3-glucoside,
pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-glucoside types and all
of which give complexes with various metal ions.39−45

In this study, we offer that the anthocyanins in various forms
preferentially made stable complexes with Au3+ ions and
resulted in the formation of Au NPs, as shown in Scheme 1. Basically, anthocyanin molecules
acted as chelating agents coordinated with Au3+ ions through
the catecholamine groups and gave stable anthocyanin–Au3+–anthocyanin complexes. During the incubation of the
complexes under stirring, the catecholamine groups were oxidized to
form quinone derivatives and the flow of electrons was orientated
from anthocyanin to Au3+ for their reduction. After reduction
of Au3+, the anthocyanin molecules also functioned as stabilizing
agents for preparation of stable zero-valent Au NPs. The major content
of berries such as anthocyanins and the total phenolic compounds were
determined and given in Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for Au NP Formation Containing
Three Following
Steps: (1) Nucleation for Formation of Seeds; (2) Growth of Seeds;
and (3) Formation of Au NPs
Characteristic absorbance peaks of the Au NPs were monitored with
UV–vis spectrophotometry owing to their strong LSPR property, Figure 1A, which exhibited
that, while strawberry (S. berry) and raspberry (R. berry) extract-directed
Au NPs gave sharp absorbance peaks around 521 nm shown with blue and
gray lines, respectively, Au NPs formed using blackberry (B. berry)
exhibited slightly a broad peak at ∼532 nm (orange line). The
color of Au NP solutions using extracts of R. berry (i), S. berry
(ii), and B. berry (iii) becomes ruby red (as photographs shown inset
of Figure 1A), which
can be a complementary indication of Au NP formation. The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of Au NPs in Figure 1B (S. berry), 1C (R.
berry), and 1D (B. berry) show that all Au
NPs are quite uniform, monodispersed, and spherical in shape with
the size of 18 ± 3 nm. We claim that high concentration anthocyanins
in the B. berry extract may cause some aggregative growth during the
formation of Au NP, which is consistent with its slightly broad absorbance
peak (orange line in Figure 1A) and the aggregated Au NP image (Figure 1D).

spectra of Au NPs.

berry, and (iii) B. berry. TEM images of Au NPs formed using 5% w/w
of (B) S. berry, (C) R. berry, and (D) B. berry.

It is worthy to mention that the concentration of Au3+ as the monomer, must reach a supersaturation point to exceed the
Gibbs free energy barrier for initiation of nucleation. Thus, the
determination of the energy barrier and the critical radius of the
nucleus are necessary and can vary on types of metal ions and reducing
and/or stabilizing agents used in NP synthesis. For this point, formation
of the Au NPs as function of various Au3+ concentrations
was evaluated. All barrier extracts were determined as 5% w/w, and
a series of Au3+ concentrations (0.25, 1, 2, 5, 10, and
20 mM) were used to optimize Au3+ concentration as presented
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Effect of the
HAuCl4 concentration on the synthesis
of Au NPs based on UV–vis spectra using 5% w/w (A) S. berry,
(B) R. berry, and (C) B. berry.

For S. berry-based synthesis, when 0.25 and 1 mM concentrations
of Au3+ were used, no stable Au NP formation was observed
owing to formation of unstable seeds (Figure 2A). While distinct absorbance peaks of Au
NPs at ∼521 nm were observed using 2 and 5 mM Au3+ ions, the Au NPs synthesized via 10 and 20 mM Au3+ displays
a slight red shift appeared at ∼545 nm. Similarly, the R. berry-directed
Au NPs formed using 0.25 and 1 mM did showed very weak peaks, but
the Au NPs synthesized with 2, 5, and 10 mM exhibited quite sharp,
intense, and narrow peaks at ∼521 nm. The very broad and low
absorbance peak was observed with use of 20 mM Au3+ (Figure 2B). We assume that
using 5% w/w R. berry may partially reduce Au3+ ions and
induce formation of less stable Au NPs, which may cause rapid agglomeration
of the Au NPs. Surprisingly, B. berry -directed Au NPs gave absorbance
peak only with 2 mM Au3+ used; no apparent absorbance values
were recorded when used with other Au3+ concentrations
(Figure 2C). It is
considered that 2 mM Au3+ toward the 5% w/w B. berry extract
is optimum concentration for complete reduction of Au3+ ions and formation of Au NPs. It is a fact that complete reduction
of metal ions can be achieved with suitable metal ion and reducing
agent concentrations.

We demonstrated that S. berry and R. berry
extracts with 1, 5,
and 20% concentrations resulted in formation of the Au NPs with characteristic
LSPR peaks (Figure 3A,B). However, ideal Au formation with sharp and narrow absorbance
peak was not observed using the 5% B. berry extract (blue line in Figure 3C). The Au NPs with
corresponding LSPR peaks were obtained using at least 10 and 20% B.
berry extracts. As we claim in Figure 2 that for synthesis of monodispersed NPs, occurrence
of homogeneous nucleation is necessary and only possible when a stable
nucleus is formed, all of which is directly dependent on the type
and concentration of the reducing agent found in barrier extracts.
The anthocyanin molecules acting as both reducing and stabilizing
agents are essential components in berry extracts and are found with
similar amounts in S. berry and in R. berry extracts compared to B.
berry (data not shown). This explanation is quite consistent with
UV–vis spectra of Au NP solutions in Figure 3.

the synthesis of
Au NPs based on UV–vis spectra using optimal HAuCl4 concentration (2 mM). (A) S. berry, (B) R. berry, and (C) B. berry.

For further evolution of Au NP synthesis, formation
of berrydirected
Au NPs was examined as a function of the reaction time through UV–vis
spectra. Figure 4 shows
that, distinct characteristic LSPR peaks of Au NPs formed using berry
extracts were observed at around 40 min; however, R. berry-directed
Au NPs gave a sharp peak LSPR peak at around 10 min (Figure 4B). The very broad LSPR peaks
of Au NPs can be an indication that formation of Au NPs was initiated
but not completed in 10 min. When S. berry and B. berry extracts as
shown in Figure 4A
(pink line) and 4C (pink line), respectively.
We propose that anthocyanin groups in the R. berry extract may rapidly
and strongly react with Au3+ ions to form stable Au NPs
compared to ones in S. berry and B. berry extracts.

of Au NPs with UV–vis spectra using
2 mM HAuCl4 and 5% w/w of. (A) S. berry, (B) R. berry,
and (C) B. berry.

The pH values of reaction
solutions may influence both formation
and stability of Au NPs in aqueous solutions owing to alteration of
charge density on the surface of Au NPs. Although the anthocyanins
found as major components in berry extracts are easily protonated
to have positive charge in acidic solution compared to polyphenols
and flavonoids, the tendency of charge-density can be related to types
of anthocyanin groups. UV–vis spectra demonstrated that the
S. berry extract formed stable Au NPs at pH 8 (red line) and 13 (light
blue line) with sharp LSPR peaks. The Au NPs formed at pH 2 (dark
blue line) and pH 5 (pink line) using S. berry extracts are unstable
in aqueous solutions and rapidly tend to aggregate owing to the incomplete
reduction of Au3+ ions as shown in Figure 5A. In Figure 5B, Au NPs synthesized at pH 5 and above using R. berry
extracts stay dispersed in the aqueous solutions, but Au NPs tend
to aggregate when synthesized at very acidic solution (pH 2). Interestingly,
the B. berry extract used as reducing and stabilizing agents resulted
in long term stable Au NPs at all acidic and basic pH values, as presented
in Figure 5C. We claim
that two potential mechanisms can be documented for elucidation of
stability of Au NPs based on reaction solution pHs: (1) The anthocyanins
in the S. berry extract are easily positively charged at low and medium
acid solutions, which may affect their binding strength on the surfaces
of Au NPs and (2) the electrostatic repulsion between Au NPs can be
decreased owing to the positive charge of anthocyanins, which may
result in aggregation of Au NPs. If the anthocyanins are not highly
protonated, they act as strong reducing and capping agents for formation
of stable Au NPs and provide well dispersed Au NPs in long term, which
are consistent with UV–vis spectra of Figure 5B,C.

values. (A) S. berry, (B) R. berry, and (C) B. berry.

It is worthy to mention that aggregation of NPs strictly
reduces
their properties and limits applications of NPs. For instance, NP
aggregates may be life-threatening when used in living organisms.
The salt-induced aggregation can be considered as a major problem
for water-soluble NPs. In Figure 6, we systematically studied the salt tolerance of the
Au NPs based upon electrostatic and capping agent stabilization. The
first protocol for Au NP synthesis was introduced in 1951 by Turkevich
and co-workers called “Turkevich”.37 In this typical method, Au NPs were produced using trisodium
citrate for reduction of Au3+ and stabilization of Au NPs
under the boiling point of Au3+ solution. Although it is
almost the most common method for synthesis of monodispersed and uniform
Au NPs in aqueous solution, Figure 6A showed that citrate-capped Au NPs have weak stability
in salt solution, while the citrate-capped Au NP solutions gave a
characteristic red wine color and sharp absorbance peaks at around
525 nm in between 5 and 20 mM NaCl solution. However, increasing concentration
of NaCl solutions from 50 to 400 mM induced aggregation of Au NPs,
which caused color change from red to purple/blue, and very broad
and shifted LSPR peaks appeared at around 570 nm, as shown in Figure 6A. Surprisingly, Figure 6B posed that berry
extract-directed Au NPs are quite stable even in high concentrations
of NaCl solutions (from 5 to 400 mM) without Au NP aggregates. No
shift in absorption maximum and no color change in berry extract-directed
Au NPs were observed. It is known that salt solution can alter the
charge density on the surface of metallic NPs and decrease the energy
barrier between NPs, all of which may bring NPs in proximity with
each other and induce aggregation.46 We
claim that anthocyanins in berry extracts strongly bind to Au NPs
as capping agents and provide electrostatic stabilization even in
400 mM NaCl solution, and eventually, aggregation of Au NPs is prevented.
We also provided a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of anthocyanins
(S. berry extract)-capped Au NP to show colloidal and stable Au NPs
in high concentration NaCl solution without agglomeration, as shown
in Supporting Information (Figure S2).
This explanation is consistent with dynamic light scattering (DLS)
results of Au NPs, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 6 Stability of Au NPs in the presence of different concentrations
of salt (NaCl) solutions. (A) Citrate-capped Au NPs and (B) anthocyanins
(S. berry extract)-capped Au NPs.

Figure 7 DLS results
of Au NPs. Citrate capped Au NPs (A) in water and (C)
in 100 mM NaCl solution. Anthocyanins (S. berry extract)-capped Au
NPs (B) in water and (D) in 100 mM NaCl solution.

Figure 7 demonstrates
that, while the effective diameter of citrate-capped Au NPs dispersed
in water was around 30 nm, their effective size increased to ∼110
nm in the presence of 100 mM NaCl solution. In contrast, DLS measurements
show that anthocyanins (S. berry extract)-capped Au NPs dispersed
in water and 100 mM NaCl solution showed effective sizes of around
37 and 45 nm, respectively. We may conclude that anthocyanins in berry
extracts effectively stabilize the Au NPs and provide unique colloidal
stability by preventing them from aggregation for several months.

Conclusions
We produced colloidal and monodispersed Au NPs
using anthocyanin-rich
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), strawberry
(Fragaria ananassa), and blackberry
(Rubus fruticosus) extracts used as
reducing and stabilizing agents. We studied experimental parameters,
such as HAuCl4·3H2O concentration, berry
extract concentrations, reaction time, and reaction pH values (pHs,
to demonstrated how they influence the formation of Au NPs). Benefiting
from complexation ability of anthocyanins with gold ions (Au3+), the Au NPs exhibited dramatically enhanced colloidal stability
in 400 Mm NaCl solution compared to commercial Au NP (citrate capped)
as they did not aggregate in 50 mM NaCl. We suggest that anthocyanins
can be promisingly alternative reagents to synthesize stable and uniform
Au NPs at RT for 30 min without any additional reagent and stimulilike
thermal reduction.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Instrumentation
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate
(HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Red raspberry (R. idaeus), strawberry (F. ananassa), and blackberry
(R. fruticosus) were purchased from
a local market. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ) from Millipore Co.,
USA, was used in all experiments. UV–vis spectrometer, SEM,
DLS, and zeta potential (ZT) instrumentations were used for characterization
of the Au NPs.

Extract Preparation
The extracts
of red raspberry (R. idaeus), strawberry
(F. ananassa), and blackberry (R. fruticosus)
were prepared by following a modified method.15 Typically, freshly purchased model berries were cut into small pats
and mixed with 100 mL distilled water into three different 500 mL
glass beakers. Each beaker was exposed to microwave (using 900 W power)
for 2 min. After that, each mixture was filtered to obtain aqueous
extracts.

Preparation and Characterization of Au NPs
Various
concentrations of Au3+ and berry extract solutions were mixed in a glass
vial, and each mixture was incubated at room temperature (25 °C)
under mild stirring for different time periods. The characteristic
LSPR absorption peaks of the Au NPs can be considered as indication
of AuNPs formation. The formation of Au NPs was systematically examined
as a function of reaction time, concentration of berry extracts, and
pH value of reaction solutions. The scanning electron microscope was
operated to produce images of Au NPs. DLS and ZT methods were utilized
to determine effective size and charge density of the Au NPs, respectively.
The characteristic LSPR peaks of the Au NPs were measured via UV–vis
spectrometry.
