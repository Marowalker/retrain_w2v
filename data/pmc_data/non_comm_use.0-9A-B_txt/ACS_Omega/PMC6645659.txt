We
prepared organic/inorganic bionanohybrid resins of polyamides
containing pyrrolidone in the backbone derived from the salt monomers
of an itaconic acid biomolecule with various nanofillers, montmorillonites
(MMTs), by cryogenic nanohybridizations. The nanohybridizations with
MMTs hardened and strengthened the polypyrrolidone bioplastic resins
owing to a simple reinforcement of hard filler incorporation. On the
other hand, the elongation at break of the resins is unexpectedly
increased by the nanohybridization with MMT sodium salt (NaMMT) to
enhance the strain energy density, which differed from those of the
nanohybrids with other organically modified MMTs. From spectroscopic
analyses, we discuss the mechanism of such ductilization effects by
NaMMT, the catalytic effect of NaMMT on partially opening the pyrrolidone
ring to make polymer backbones flexible and to form carboxyl side
chains that are strongly interactive with NaMMT fillers.

Introduction
Development of environmentally
friendly polymer materials such
as biobased plastics is indispensable for the establishment of sustainable
society.1 Polyamides (PAs) are widely used
as engineering thermoplastics owing to their unique physiochemical
properties, and their high thermomechanical properties are of great
interest in the polymer industries.2−4 A variety of procedures
for obtaining nanocomposites from various PAs with organically modified
silicate clays have been developed successfully through in situ melt
polycondensation, which allows the extension of their applications
into broader and more demanding areas in the polymer industries.5−7 The improved properties of PA/montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites
have been attributed to the high specific area and aspect ratio of
the silicates as well as the good matrix–filler interaction
involving ionic bonds with the silicate layers of the smectite groups.8−12 To achieve well-exfoliated morphologies and subsequently to improve
properties, it is necessary to find the surfactant structure appropriate
for reducing the platelet–platelet interaction of MMT for the
amide to adhere to the MMT surface.13−17 Nevertheless, the formation of the nanohybrid structure
favors the ionic–van der Waals interaction between the clay
and the PA, which disrupts the dislocation of clay18−20 after cryogenic
treatment using liquid nitrogen.21−23 Biobased heterocyclic
PAs have been synthesized from itaconic acid (IA) which was mass-produced
from Aspergillus terreus fungus in
the presence of carbohydrates.24−26 The melt polycondensation of
IA salts with diamines formed a heterocyclic N-substituted 3-carboxy-2-pyrrolidones
via the aza-Michael addition followed by amidation, as shown in the
previous paper.7,25 A rigid heterocyclic ring has
high thermal properties owing to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with an extensive rigid backbone, but the mechanical properties were
not high enough for them to be widely applied in industry as high-performance
materials. Here, we report the nanohybridization of a polypyrrolidone-based
PA derived from IA salts with hexamethylenediamine.25 We used the PA deeply frozen under liquid nitrogen at a
cryogenic temperature to enhance the mechanical properties.23 The synthesized nanohybrids show not only increased
Young’s moduli but also enhanced toughness owing to the incorporation
of MMT sodium salt (NaMMT).27

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of Nanohybrids
IA-based PAs were formed
after the melt polycondensation of salt monomers of hexamethylenediamine
with IA. PAs, having a component of rigid heterocyclic N-substituted
3-carboxy-2-pyrrolidone, were formed through the aza-Michael addition
of diamine to IA and successive amidation under the condition at 170
°C for 18 h (yields, 90–92 wt %). The prepared PAs show Mw and Mn ranging
from 84 000 to 36 500, respectively, with a polydispersity
index (Mw/Mn) of 2.31. The clay such as MMT is considered as a potential candidate
of filler materials to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties.
Thereafter, the obtained polymer was melt-mixed with the clay for
5 h at 170–210 °C to give NaMMT/PA-based nanohybrids.
As a result, the nanohybrid resins have relatively higher mechanical
properties as compared with neat PAs. However, their limited mechanical
properties restrict them to be used in engineering applications that
have high requirements to tailoring the properties after keeping them
at a low temperature around 77 K in liquid nitrogen. On the basis
of this information, we tried to make the cryogenic and annealing
treatment for the nanohybrids to overcome their brittleness problem.
The mechanical properties of the nanohybrid with 1–7 wt % are
investigated; the maximum MMT loading contents were 7 wt % in any
MMTs owing to the difficulty of homogeneous mixing. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis was made to observe the dispersion of the
clays in the polymer matrix. Thin cross sections of the clay with
a thickness ranging from 5 to 10 nm by slicing with the diamond cutter
using the microtome machine under liquid nitrogen were used. A representative
image is shown in Figure 1. The dark line with a thickness in the range of 19.1 ±
2.7 nm and a length in the range of 97.4 ± 6.2 nm represents
the intersection of MMT layers into the PA matrix as white regions.
Exfoliated clay morphologies consisting of predominantly individual
platelets dispersed uniformly over the PA matrix.

PA/NaMMT hybrid with a NaMMT content of
1 wt %.

Thermal Behavior of Nanohybrids
The effects of MMT
incorporation into PA on thermal degradation of the nanohybrids in
the range between room temperature and 800 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere were investigated. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
thermograph presented in Figure S1 was
taken after annealing at 220 °C (means fifth sampling shown in
the Supporting Information) at the rate
of 10 °C/h. The 10 wt % loss temperature, Td10, of the neat PA was 399 °C, but its hybridization
with NaMMT (5 wt %) at 220 °C increased Td10 to 409 °C. On the other hand, the cryogenic treatment
for PA/NaMMT hybrids further increased Td10 to 423 °C (Figure S1). The cryogenic
treatment has been reported to restrict the polymer chain mobility
by enhancing the interaction of PA chains with MMT.20,21,26 Under liquid nitrogen temperature, most
of the local movement in PA chains were frozen to shrink temporarily.
If the chains were frozen together with NaMMT, the shrinking force
could cause the chains to be closer to NaMMT than before treatment,
enhancing the PA–NaMMT interaction. The cryogenic hybridization
effects on glass transition temperature, Tg, were subsequently investigated. The Tg of the neat PA appeared at around 73 °C, whereas increasing
the content of the NaMMT from 1 to 7 wt % decreased Tg to 60 °C, as shown in Figure S2. When other clays of organically modified MMTs such as ArMMT
and OHMMT were used after cryogenic hybridization, the decrease in Tg was only slight (Figure 2). These observations were unexpected, and
some of the opposite effects to regular reinforcement by NaMMT should
have occurred. Further, we also compared the Tg values with 5 wt % of the clay-loaded composite (PA/NaMMT)
with a neat PA during annealing at 220 °C (fifth sampling), as
shown in Figure S3. The result suggested
that after annealing at 220 °C, the Tg values were slightly lower than in the neat PAs. However, a cryogenic-hybridized
sample showed a Tg value of 61 °C
which was slightly higher than a noncryo-treated sample (57 °C),
as shown in Figure S3.

calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the PA/MMT
nanohybrids after cryogenic hybridization.

Mechanical Properties
The mechanical properties of
the neat PA and PA/MMT nanohybrids were measured by stress–strain
analyses at room temperature in a tensile mode (Figure 3). From the stress–strain curve, Young’s
modulus was estimated as 1.9 GPa from the inclination of the initial
elastic region. The maximal tensile strength was 65 MPa, and the maximal
elongation was 0.052 from the breaking point. From Figure 3, the improvement in mechanical
properties over pure PAs after a small amount of clay loading is apparent.
The prepared PA/NaMMT samples show tensile strengths and Young’s
moduli in the range of 65–133 MPa and 1.9–4.8 GPa, respectively,
as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Stress–strain curves of PA/NaMMT hybrids prepared by the
cryogenic procedure. Inset values are weight compositions of NaMMT
to PA.

However, the necking phenomenon
was observed during elongation
to show a local maximum of the stress–strain curve when only
a small amount of NaMMT (1 wt %) was hybridized by the cryogenic procedure.
As the amount of NaMMT was increased to 7 wt %, the initial inclination,
the local peak size, and the elongation ratio at break were all increased.
The gradual increment of elongation at break was in the range of 0.52–0.23.
PA/OHMMT and PA/ArMMT hybrids showed different stress–strain
behaviors from PA/NaMMT (Figure S4a,b).
The initial inclination and maximal stress were increased by hybridizing
with these organically modified MMTs. However, elongations at breaks
were decreased. One can see that hybridization with organically modified
MMTs makes resins strong and hard but brittle when compared to NaMMT.
However, we have compared the mechanical strength and Young’s
modulus of the elasticity behavior of 5 wt % fillers of NaMMT-, OHMMT-,
and ArMMT-based nanohybrids (fifth sampling), as shown in (Figure S5a–c). The tensile strengths of
without/with cryo-treated nanohybrids were with NaMMT (102 and 129
MPa), with OHMMT (170 and 203 MPa), and with ArMMT (185 and 217 MPa).
However, Young’s moduli of nanohybrids were with NaMMT (2.7
and 2.5 GPa), with OHMMT (4.8 and 5.1 GPa), and with ArMMT (5.2 and
5.3 GPa). This trend demonstrates that the polymer properties were
tailored by cryogenic hybridization. The mechanical data such as tensile
strength at maximum, Young’s modulus, and strain energy density
are summarized in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Mechanical properties of PA/MMT nanohybrids with various clay contents.
(a) Tensile strength at maximum, (b) Young’s modulus, and (c)
strain energy density.

Tensile strength at maximum monotonously increased by an
increase
in MMT contents in all MMT types (Figure 4a). ArMMT was the most effective in enhancing
the strength up to 244 MPa, presumably because of the improved compatibility
of MMT with PA by the modification of the aromatic moiety. The strengths
in all of these MMTs were comparable with or higher than that of glass-fiber
(30%) reinforced PA 66 (190 MPa; material datasheet of PA66-GF30−BASF
Ultramid) which is widely used as an engineering plastic around the
world. Young’s modulus of PA/MMT hybrids showed an increase
in MMT contents similar to the strength (Figure 4b) and was 5.5 GPa at maximum for a resin
with 7 wt % of ArMMT. On the other hand, the value of Young’s
modulus at maximum is lower than that of PA66-GF30 (10 GPa), indicating
that the resins of the present PA/MMT hybrid were softer than conventional
PA66-GF30. The elongation behavior of PA hybrids with NaMMT was quite
different from those of the other PA/MMT hybrids, as mentioned above.
The maximal value was around 20% in 5 or 7 wt % content of NaMMT (Figure 3), which was much
higher than that of PA66-GF30. This finding means that NaMMT showed
an enhancing effect on the ductility of PA. The values of strain energy
densities to the fiber unit volume were then calculated from the area
under stress–strain curves, and the results are summarized
in Figure 4c. Strain
energy densities of PA/NaMMT hybrids were 21 MJ/m3 at maximum
which was much higher than those of other PA/MMT hybrids. This is
derived from unique elongation behavior of PA/NaMMT hybrids with 5
or 7 wt % clay contents which are maintained at around 100 MPa of
stress similar to a strong and hard rubber. Overall, three of the
MMTs used here had reinforcement effects on PA to enhancing the mechanical
strength and hardness. In a departure from the general behavior of
reinforcement, however, NaMMT had a ductilization effect that imparted
a high elongation value to PA. Because Young’s moduli were
enhanced, this is not a simple plasticizing effect. All of the effects
of NaMMT on PA were induced to increase the strain energy density,
which is very useful for making safer polymer materials. We will now
discuss the mechanisms bestowing such good ductilization effects of
NaMMT to PA. The stress–strain curves of PA/NaMMT hybrids showed
a straight transverse line via the local peak just after initial elasticity
similar to a rubber, which might be attributed to the cross-linking
formation. However, the covalent network formation was prevented by
dissolving the resin in dimethylformamide, which makes us consider
some of the strong physical interactions of PA chains with the NaMMT
surface. The cryogenic treatment of the hybrids can increase toughness
presumably owing to the thermal shrinkage of the polymer matrix dispersed
by MMT clay platelets.

The cryogenic treatment of the prepared
nanohybrid enhances physical
interaction between the clay and the polymer. However, as described
above, NaMMT has a smaller effect on increasing the mechanical strength
and Young’s moduli than organically modified MMTs, so the interaction
with PA chains should be intrinsically lower. Then, some of the special
domain of PA/NaMMT could play the role of a cross-linking junction.
In the previous paper,25 the ring-opening
reaction of pyrrolidones in the main chain to form carboxylic acid
side groups in an alkaline solution or in water under ultraviolet
irradiation was confirmed. We then checked the polymer chain structure
of PA/NaMMT resins by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR analyses. In the FTIR spectrogram,
we confirmed that a small carbonyl peak of PA/NaMMT samples appeared
at 1737 cm–1, suggesting that the ring opened to
form carboxylic acid (Figure S6a). Furthermore, 1H NMR in Figure S6b showed that
some of the small signals appeared by overlapping with the original
signals of the polymer, but secondary amine or carboxylic acid could
not be detected owing to active protons. The 1H NMR analysis
showed around 26 mol % conversion of the ring-opening reaction. Furthermore,
in Figure S7a, the neat PA did not show
any small signals, but in Figure S7b, the 13C NMR analysis showed that small signals of PA/NaMMT samples
appeared overlapping with the original PA signals, and a new signal
assigned to a carboxylic acid peak appeared at 173 ppm. The ring-opening
reaction catalyzed by NaMMT platelets with an alkalescent property
should enhance the interaction of carboxylate with the surface of
NaMMT, as shown in Figure 5. The slight decrease in Tg by
hybridizing with NaMMT might be attributed to such a ring-opening
reaction to reduce the chain rigidity.

NaMMT functions to catalyze the ring-opening
reaction of pyrrolidone in the main chain to form carboxylic acid
that specifically interacts with the MMT surface.

Conclusions
A representative biomolecule, IA, mass-produced
by A. terreus fermentation underwent
polycondensation
with hexamethylenediamine via salt monomers to develop biobased PAs.
Successive cryogenic hybridization with MMTs allowed the creation
of strong and ductile resins. The tensile strength and Young’s
modulus of the prepared composites were 2.2–5.5 GPa and 65–241
MPa, respectively, which were comparable with or higher than those
of conventional glass-fiber-reinforced PA 66. PA/NaMMT hybrids with
7 wt % clay content enhanced elongation at break, and the strain energy
density peaked at 21 MJ/m3. NaMMT had catalytic effects
on the ring opening of the pyrrolidone ring to form carboxylic acid
side groups, to induce flexibility in the polymer backbone and a strong
interaction of the silicate layer with the polymer chains. These findings
can hopefully be extended to the universal combination of polymers
having heterocycles with alkalescent fillers to enhance strength,
hardness, and ductility, thus opening up a new field of polymer/nanofiller
hybrids.

Materials and Methods
Materials
IA was dedicated as a
bioderived diacid from
Iwata Chemical Co. Ltd. All clays were obtained from Kunimine Industries
Co. Ltd. The clays were used after being preheated in an oven at 200
°C to remove moisture. NaMMT with a cation exchange capacity
of 115 mequiv/100 g, MMT treated with benzyl ammonium chloride (ArMMT),
and MMT treated with alkyl bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methyl ammonium chloride
(OHMMT) were used. NaH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich),
used as a catalyst for the polymerization of IA-based salt monomers,
was used as received without purification. Hexamethylenediamine purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI, Japan) was used as a diamine monomer
without further purification.

Syntheses of Monomers and
Polymers
A homogeneous mixture
of IA and hexamethylenediamine was prepared by mixing the solution
of IA (1 mol) in EtOH (300 mL) and hexamethylenediamine (1 mol) in
EtOH (200 mL). The mixture was kept for 30 min at room temperature
to form salts as a white solid (92% yield). The resulting solid product
was heated at a temperature of 5 °C higher than the onset weight
loss temperature of the TGA curve of individual salt monomers. The
salt monomers were vigorously agitated at 165–170 °C with
50–60 rpm in the presence of the catalyst NaH2PO4 (0.1 wt %) to be polymerized in bulk. After 18 h, viscous
polymer melts were formed. Mw and Mn of the polymer were 84 000 and 36 500,
respectively, with a polydispersity index Mw/Mn of 2.31, which was narrow enough
to study further. The clay predried overnight at 200 °C was added
to the molten polymers at 170 °C, and the temperature was increased
to 220 °C slowly with a heating ratio of 10 °C/h under agitation
(300 rpm), and the mixture was cryogenically treated under liquid
nitrogen for 1 min and was repeated five times, as shown in the Supporting Information. The product was directly
spun as fibers from the melted reaction mixture (yields, 90–92
wt %), as shown in Scheme 1.

Tensile Strength
Mechanical testing tests of the fibers
were performed using a tensile testing machine (INSTRON, Canton City,
MA, USA, 3365-L5). Both edges of the fibrous samples with a length
over 10 mm were clipped and elongated at a 1 mm/s movement at room
temperature. Young’s moduli were defined as the initial inclination
of the stress–strain curve. Mechanical strength and elongation
at break were analyzed. Strain energy density to volume was estimated
from stress–strain curves. Mechanical property values reported
here represent an average of the resulting values of specimens.

DSC Measurement
DSC has been performed on a DSC apparatus
(Seiko Instrument Inc., EXSTARX-DSC7000 SII) where the temperature
and heat flow scales were calibrated using indium and tin standards
with high purity. The sample weight was in the range of 5–10
mg, and the sample temperatures were scanned from 25 to 250 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Neat
PAs, as well as the
nanohybrids, were subjected to a TGA machine (SSC/5200 SII Seiko Instruments
Inc. equipment).The sample with a weight of 5–10 mg was heated
from 25 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a
nitrogen atmosphere, and the corresponding weight loss was recorded.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM observations have
been carried out on TEM-7100 Hitachi equipped with a field emission
gun. Ultrathin sections of 55–60 nm thickness were cut with
a diamond knife at a temperature of −80 °C from the bulk
polymer resin using an ultramicrotome. These sections were placed
on a copper grid and observed at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV,
and bright-field micrographs were recorded.

FTIR Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of the PAs and salt
monomers were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrum one spectrometer
using a diamond attenuated total reflection accessory over the range
of 4000–400 cm–1. The samples were dried
at 100 °C overnight before the measurement. The FTIR spectra
of the PA nanocomposites were also obtained.
