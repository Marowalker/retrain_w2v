Glutathione
(GSH)-coated gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) were synthesized
in aqueous acidic medium. On deprotonation of the carboxyl groups
of the GSH molecules under alkaline condition, the anionic ends react
with the added cationic surfactant molecules to convert the Au NCs
hydrophobic, resulting in loss of fluorescence due to apparent insolubility
in water. The fluorescence is revived by adding cyclodextrins (CDs)
that encapsulate the protruding hydrophobic tails of the surfactant
molecules surrounding the GSH-coated Au NCs. While addition of β-CD
showed maximum revival of the Au NC fluorescence, that by adding α-CD
was lesser. Interestingly, on adding γ-CD, there was no increase
in fluorescence of Au NCs at all. The size of CDs varies as γ-
> β- > α-. It appears that the cavity size of the
CD-hosts
controls the fluorescence from the Au NCs abruptly, and the reason
behind that was found to be formation of suprastructures, the shapes
of which varied from spherical to cubic. The work shows the production
of Au NC-grafted CD suprastructures that develop fluorescence on–off
composites on the basis of their overall shapes.

Introduction
Typically, tens to
hundreds of Au atoms constitute gold nanoclusters
(Au NCs) with diameters between 2 and 3 nm. Au NCs are generally synthesized
by accumulation of Au ions aided by ligands or protein that protect
the Au core.1,2 The widely used two-phase synthetic
strategy in the Brust–Shiffiren method is often used to obtain
[Aun(SR)m]q-type thiolate-protected Au NCs of uniform size
distribution, where n is the number of Au atoms, m is the number of thiolate ligands (SR), and q is the total valence charge on the cluster (if any).3,4 As a result of the ultrasmall size, these nanoclusters are considered
as quantum particles where discrete valence electronic states are
found for Aun(SR)m instead of a quasi-continuous 5d band, and hence they adopt molecule-like
properties including fluorescence emission due to transition between
highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital.5−7

Although various types of protecting ligands
are used to synthesize
Au NCs, among all, the thiolate ligands show excellent stability and
versatility in surface functionalization.8 Gold-thiolate protecting units are created by the thiolate group
(−SR) by strongly disturbing the surface structure of the Au
core.8 Expectedly, due to their great potential,
the thiolate-protected Au NCs have become inevitable components for
applications in the field of catalysis, sensing, fluorescence labeling,
biomedicine, and so on.8−12

In this regard, small naturally occurring peptides, such as
glutathione
or GSH, have proved to be good surface ligands for Au NCs, which help
them escape the reticulo-endothelial system absorption and hence resulting
ease of deposition in tumors.13,14 Stress-induced cytotoxicity
of thiolate-protected chiral Au NCs has been critically explained
by Zhang et al.15 They have also shown
that these Au NCs can be utilized in targeted photodynamic therapy
as they possess superior penetration and retention in tumors.16 Such Au NCs can even reprogram DNA epigenetic
patterns.17 Reports have shown that among
the glutathione-protected (SG) Au NCs, Au25(SG)18 is particularly
stable compared to the stability in the other sizes.18,19 Wu et al. have clarified the structural stability of Au25(SG)18
with two types of Au–S binding.20 They have explained the uniqueness of Au25(SR)18 clusters where,
except the central gold atom in the Au-icosahedron, all of the 24
gold atoms in the two shells are bonded to SG.

Cyclodextrin
(CD)-capped Au–SG NCs have been used to probe
Ag(I) in water in the concentration range between 0.5 nM and 0.1 μM,
with a detection limit at 0.3 nM.21 In
another report, Mathew et al. have presented interaction between an
atomically precise 25-atom Au NC anchored to a ligand and β-CD.22 They have showed that the CD moieties present
on the cluster surface provide enhanced stability. They have also
mentioned their potency in biology and toward supramolecular functionalization.
Similar study on the interaction of adamantine-terminated Au NCs with
α-, β-, and γ-CDs has been reported by Yan et al.23 They found β-CDs to be better candidates
compared with α- and γ-CDs to efficiently chemisorb onto
the Au NCs.

The Au25(SG)18 clusters display strong one- and
two-photon excitation
emission and are applied as fluorescence contrast agents for live
cell imaging.24 They are photostable and
biocompatible and have very low toxicity to live cells even at high
concentrations. These Au NCs typically emit at 650 nm due to one-photon
excitation.24 Considering the significance,
stability, and biocompatibility of the Au25(SG)18 clusters, herein
we have demonstrated that on interaction with CDs of various cavity
space dimensions, these clusters form suprastructures that are either
spherical or cubic. The structural modifications induce extensive
effects on the photophysics of the Au NCs, which has been ascribed
to collisional quenching of energy.

Results and Discussion
The ultrasmall GSH-coated Au NCs were synthesized following a reported
protocol.25 It is also suggested that these
Au NCs are excellent candidates for radiotherapy, causing negligible
damage to normal tissues, and can be efficiently cleared by the kidney.13 The synthesized GSH-protected Au NCs were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), and absorption and emission spectroscopies (Figure 1a–d). The characterization
data show that the Au NCs have around 2 nm diameter, and the EDS data
confirm the presence of Au in the clusters. The absorption and emission
spectra typically match with Au29–43(SG)27–37 clusters.13

Figure 1 Characterization of GSH-coated
Au NCs: (a) TEM image, (b) EDS data,
(c) absorption, and (d) emission spectra (λex = 365
nm). The solutions were made in aqueous medium.

In a previous report, we showed that l-cysteine
can form
a double layer while protecting the Au NCs with the cysteinyl thiol
groups projecting outward. As thiol group is hydrophobic, the hydrophobic
CD cavities could encapsulate them to accumulate around the Au NCs.26 The CD sizes developed spherical to cubic suprastructures
with embedded Au NCs. This work was performed with eight-atom blue-emitting
Au NCs. On the basis of a similar principle, we have developed the
present work, where the Au NCs have around 29 Au atoms and hydrophobicity
was induced tactically so that the different stages of formation of
the suprastructure can be clearly understood.

The GSH-coated
Au NCs (Aum(SG)n), where the GSH molecules attach to the Au
atoms through the S atom, have two projected arms on both sides of
the S atom that contain two carboxyl groups. The initial acidic solution
of the Au NCs (pH 3–4) was made alkaline (pH 8–9) to
convert the −COOH groups to −COO– keeping
the Au NCs intact, which was checked spectroscopically, and the ζ-potential
was calculated (Figure S1), which confirmed
the negative surface charge of the Au NCs. At this pH, we added cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) (a cationic surfactant) to the solution. Owing to the
electrostatic interaction between the cationic head group of CTAB
and the anionic −COO– groups of the protecting
thiolate, the Au NCs became hydrophobic as the hydrocarbon tails of
the CTAB molecules protrude outward. This process gradually reduces
the fluorescence of the Au NCs as they separate out from the aqueous
environment due to hydrophobicity (Figure 2). To avoid formation of CTAB micelles, the
surfactant concentration was kept sufficiently low.

Figure 2 Fluorescence intensity
of GSH-coated Au NC (black) decreases on
addition of 0.01–0.04 mM CTAB (λex = 365 nm).
Concentration of the Au NCs was 0.1 mM in water (pH 8–9).

As mentioned earlier, CDs are
excellent candidates for host–guest
chemistry as their hydrophobic cavities readily encapsulate hydrophobic
guests. On addition of α-, β-, and γ-CDs (inner
cavity diameters are approximately 5.7, 7.8, and 9.5 Å, respectively),27 we observed modification of the spectroscopic
characteristics of the Au NCs. On addition of CDs to the slightly
alkaline solution of GSH–CTAB-coated Au NCs, the pH became
neutral and hence the guest–host chemistry took place at pH
7. To avoid unwanted aggregation of the CDs, comparable concentrations
were added to the NCs. The dynamic light scattering data confirmed
the size of the composites (Figure S2).
Whereas addition of α- and β-CDs revived the fluorescence
of the profusely quenched GSH–CTAB-coated Au NCs due to dissolution
in water, addition of γ-CDs showed further quenching (Figure 3). Application of
α-CD could approximately double the quenched emission of the
Au NCs, and β-CDs tripled it. The unusual behavior of γ-CD
attracts attention and hence creates avenues for further studies.

Figure 3 Relative
change in fluorescence intensity of GSH–CTAB-coated
Au NCs on addition of CDs. The excitation wavelength is 365 nm.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrographs (Figure 4) show that on addition of
the three types of CDs, different self-assembled suprastructures were
developed incorporating the GSH–CTAB-coated Au NCs. Existence
of Au NCs inside the CD suprastructures has been confirmed by collecting
EDS data, as shown in Figure S3. Enhancement
of fluorescence emission from the Au NCs resulted due to solubilization
of the insoluble hydrophobic GSH–CTAB–Au NCs by α-
and β-CDs. In both these cases, spherical suprastructures grew
up due to incorporation of the hydrophobic tails of the surrounding
CTAB molecules. The dimension and texture of the aggregates indicate
that multiple minute spherical units have assembled together to form
larger spheres. This is possible as the rims of
the CDs contain hydroxyl groups that are capable of forming hydrogen
bonds and connect similar units.26,28−30 However, we found cubes on addition of γ-CDs to the GSH–CTAB-coated
Au NCs.26 The difference in the texture
of the aggregates is, thus, presumed to be due to the difference in
the dimension of the CDs. The probable nature of arrangement of the
CDs around the GSH–CTAB-coated Au NCs is presented in Figure 5. Although the sizes
of the α- and β-CDs allow approaching in multiple numbers
around the Au NCs, the bigger size of the γ-CDs can ideally
accommodate six of them. The number (six) of γ-CDs could be
proposed by considering the size of the Au NCs and the CD. The diameter
of the Au NCs is ∼2 nm, and the outer rim size of γ-CD
is approximately 1 nm. Hence, the estimated number of γ-CDs
that can surround one Au NC could not be more than six due to space
limitation. This initiates the formation of a cubic unit cell that
multiplies through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the γ-CDs
to create the bigger cubic suprastructures.

Au NCs; (d) magnified image of the γ-CD encapsulated aggregate.

Figure 5 Probable arrangement of the three types of CDs
around the GSH–CTAB-coated
Au NCs.

Typically, the α-, β-,
and γ-CDs have 13.7, 15.3,
and 16.9 Å outer diameters, respectively.27 The loosely arranged α-CDs around the GSH–CTAB-coated
Au NCs due to their smallest size could double the quenched fluorescence
emission of the GSH–CTAB-coated Au NCs by solubilization, whereas
the bigger β-CDs could enhance the emission further due to more
compact arrangement. However, the fluorescence from the Au NCs was
further quenched on interaction with the γ-CDs, which is the
largest within the CD family. The results indicate better solubilization
of the Au NCs with α- and β-CDs than that with γ-CDs.
Moreover, there can be collisions between the fluorescing suprastructures,
which may result in partial quenching of fluorescence due to energy
transfer. Although for α- and β-CDs the latter are subdued
by solubilization, it is overwhelming for γ-CD. The reason could
be the shape of the suprastructures. The area of contact between colliding
spheres is much less compared to that of cubes, which leads to better
energy dissipation for the cubic Au NC-embedded γ-CD suprastructures.

Time-resolved fluorescence measurements on the Au NCs and composites
support our proposition, as
given in Table 1. The
pristine GSH-protected Au NCs decay data take triexponential fit due
to the present components, which are Au(I) (τ1),
Au(0) (τ2), and electron transfer between Au(I) and
Au(0) (τ3). The data show that the contribution of
τ3 increases considerably on addition of CDs to the
GSH–CTAB-protected Au NCs. This probably happens due to the
aggregation of Au NCs into larger entities where intercluster electron
transfer between Au(I) and Au(0) can occur along with the intracluster
process.31 The other excited state lifetimes
are comparable and indicate that the difference in texture of the
aggregates could be the principle cause for the variation in photophysics
of the Au NCs on interaction with the different CDs. The collisional
energy transfer between the suprastructures generally takes place
at a very fast time scale (few picoseconds) and hence could not be
monitored by the present setup.

Conclusions
GSH-protected Au NCs
have been developed in acidic medium, followed
by dehydrogenetaion of the thiolates under alkaline condition to electrostatically
interact with the cationic heads of CTAB, resulting in conversion
of the hydrophilic Au NCs into hydrophobic ones and hence eliminating
their fluorescence due to separation from water. The fluorescence
was differentially revived by α- and β-CDs through spherical
suprastructure formation that was seeded by spherical unit cells through
hydrogen bonding between the surrounding CDs. Accumulation of six
γ-CDs around one GSH–CTAB-coated Au NC, due to size restriction,
developed cubic unit cells that grew into microcubes and collided
to shed energy to the environment. Hence, no increase in fluorescence
emission was observed in this case. The results, on the one hand,
provide important information on guest–host interaction between
CDs of various sizes and Au NCs and, on the other hand, provide interesting
mechanisms for suprastructure formation in solution through self-accumulation
via hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the ingredients are biocompatible,
and hence the outcome from the present work has biological relevance
as CDs are often used as carriers for biomarkers. The work opens new
methods of applications in the fields of constructing logic gates
or on/off molecular switches.
