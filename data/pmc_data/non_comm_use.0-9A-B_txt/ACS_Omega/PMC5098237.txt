Healthcare-associated
infections pose a serious risk for patients,
staff, and visitors and are a severe burden on the National Health
Service, costing at least £1 billion annually. Antimicrobial
surfaces significantly contribute toward reducing the incidence of
infections as they prevent bacterial adhesion and cause bacterial
cell death. Using a simple, easily upscalable swell–encapsulation–shrink
method, novel antimicrobial surfaces have been developed by incorporating
metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) and crystal violet (CV) dye into medical-grade
polyurethane sheets. This study compares the bactericidal effects
of polyurethane incorporating ZnO, Mg-doped ZnO, and MgO. All metal
oxide NPs are well defined, with average diameters ranging from 2
to 18 nm. These materials demonstrate potent bactericidal activity
when tested against clinically relevant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus. Additionally, these composites are tested
against an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that is rife in hospitals
throughout the UK. Furthermore, we have tested these materials using
a low light intensity (∼500 lx), similar to that present in
many clinical environments. The highest activity is achieved from
polymer composites incorporating CV and ∼3 nm ZnO NPs, and
the different performances of the metal oxides have been discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Healthcare-associated
infections (HCAIs) affect millions of patients
worldwide, resulting in significant mortality and economic impact.
This burden continues to grow as increasingly susceptible patients,
such as the elderly or those suffering from chronic conditions, become
more common.1−3 It has been estimated that effective new antimicrobials
used in combination with improved health/safety good practice could
prevent an estimated 15–30% of HCAIs in the United Kingdom.3,4 The development of such self-sterilizing surfaces in hospitals could
sustainably reduce the HCAI rates over time by eliminating the transfer
of bacteria that would usually occur from contact among patients,
healthcare workers, and contaminated hospital surfaces.5 One preventative strategy is to produce antimicrobial
coatings that can kill the bacteria by continually delivering active
compounds to the environment.6 Such products
include microbiocide-releasing surfaces and metal-coated surfaces
(e.g., silver and copper).5

An alternative
method for disinfecting surfaces is by coating them
with light-activated antimicrobial agents, such as photosensitizers,
which destroy bacteria via the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) using photodynamic therapy (PDT).7 Unlike other antimicrobials, radical species have nonspecific targets
within a microbe, decreasing the likelihood of developing resistance.8,9 Upon light activation, the photosensitizer molecules in their ground
state are promoted to the lowest energy excited singlet state and
can then undergo intersystem crossing to a longer-lived excited triplet
state, which mediates the generation of cytotoxic ROS via type I or
type II mechanistic pathways.7 Type I involves
the activated photosensitizer reacting directly with the substrate
or molecule to form radicals, and type II involves the formation of
singlet oxygen from ground-state molecular oxygen via the triplet
state.9 Common photosensitizers used to
destroy cancerous tissues include Rose Bengal,10,11 methylene blue,8,12−16 and crystal violet (CV).17−22 These photosensitizers can be coated onto polymers, and upon light
activation, they generate ROS, causing oxidative damage and cell death.21 We have previously reported a detailed description
of the photochemical mechanisms involved in PDT.20

Dye-coated polymeric surfaces have shown significant
enhancement
of bactericidal activity when combined with various nanoparticles
(NPs)8,9,15,20−22 that display antibacterial properties relative
to the bulk phase due to an increased surface area, leading to a greater
particle surface reactivity.23 ZnO NPs
with antibacterial activity have received much interest for biomedical
applications, as studies have shown them to have selective toxicity
toward bacteria but minimal effects on mammalian cells.20 The proposed mechanism of their antimicrobial
activity is through photo-oxidative stress induced by ROS generation,24 similar to the mechanism of photosensitizers.
There have been various studies on the efficacious bactericidal effects
of MgO,25−29 and similar to ZnO, its advantages include affordability and biocompatibility.
Properties such as size, morphology, concentration, and defects30 can affect the antibacterial activity of NPs,
for example, smaller sized NPs possess better antimicrobial action.31

It is well established in the literature
that doping into ZnO host
matrices can enhance their antibacterial activity by tuning their
optical and electrical properties.32−34 Zhang et al. reported
that doping ZnO with Ag increased the antibacterial activity of ZnO,30 and many studies have shown similar effects
by doping ZnO with Sn,35 Co,33 and Mn.34,36 Mg2+ ions
are readily incorporated into the ZnO lattice by substitution due
to the similar ionic radii of Mg2+ and Zn2+.37 It is reported that doping ZnO with Mg can change
its electronic and luminescent properties, surface morphology, and
defect density.38 The surface (defect)
structure is of particular interest with respect to the generation
of ROS; therefore, investigating the effects of dopants on antibacterial
activity is of interest.

In a previous study by our group, ∼18
nm ZnO NPs were synthesized
via thermal decomposition of zinc oleate and encapsulated into medical-grade
polyurethane squares that were coated with CV dye.20 At a visible light intensity of ∼6600 lx, these
samples were highly effective at reducing the numbers of Escherichia coli within 4 h and Staphylococcus
aureus within only 1 h by ≥4 log. Such
potent antibacterial activity was also observed against both the bacteria
in the dark using the combination of CV and ZnO, demonstrating that
a synergistic effect is responsible for the increased antibacterial
activity shown by the dye and NP together.

In this article,
we report the preparation of 15–18 nm sized
Mg-doped ZnO (ZnMgO; 10% Mg) and MgO NPs capped with oleic acid (OA).
These NPs are swell-encapsulated into CV-coated polyurethane, and
their antibacterial activities are assessed in the dark and after
exposure to visible light.20 Alongside
these larger NPs, we synthesized 2–4 nm sized di(octyl) phosphinic
acid (DOPA)-capped ZnO and ZnMgO NPs (10% Mg), which were also incorporated
with CV and encapsulated into polyurethane for antibacterial activity.
For these samples incorporating smaller NPs, we used a much lower
light intensity than that in the previous work (∼500 lx), as
this is the level typically present in the clinical areas of a London
teaching hospital (Prof. P. Wilson, personal communication). To further
increase the relevance of our work to healthcare environments, we
tested the bactericidal activity of our novel, biocompatible materials
using an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (EMRSA-16), one of two clones known to predominate
in the United Kingdom (PHE). We hypothesized that the light-induced
bactericidal activity of ZnO NPs in combination with CV will depend
on the NP size and doping with Mg. Therefore, the primary aim of this
study was to investigate whether the bactericidal activity of ZnO
NPs is affected by the diameter, with and without Mg doping, using
two different methods for preparing small doped ZnO NPs with diameters
as small as 2 nm. We also examined the effect of the capping ligand
on the antibacterial efficacy. Whereas we demonstrated that smaller
ZnO NPs exhibit a higher bactericidal activity even without a photosensitizer,
doping with Mg elicited no significant enhancement in the antibacterial
activity of ZnO.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemicals and Substrates
All chemicals
and reagents described in the NP synthesis and material preparation
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. except for toluene
(Fischer Scientific, UK) and dichloromethane (DCM) (VWR, UK). Deionized
water (resistivity 15 MΩ cm) was used in all synthetic
work, and the substrate was medical-grade flat polyurethane sheets
(thickness 0.8 mm) purchased from American Polyfilm Inc. (Branford,
CT).

2.2 NP Synthesis
2.2.1 OA-Capped
NP Synthesis
ZnMgO (10%
Mg) and MgO NPs capped with OA were synthesized using a previously
adapted method from Park et al.39 Zinc(II)
chloride (10 mmol, 1.36 g) and sodium oleate (20 mmol, 6.08 g) were
added to a solvent mixture of ethanol, hexane, and deionized water
(60 °C, 4 h) to produce zinc oleate. Sodium chloride was washed
and removed, and the remaining organic layer was dried in vacuo to
remove hexane, yielding zinc oleate as a white solid. Magnesium oleate
was synthesized using the same procedure, with magnesium(II) chloride
as the precursor. Zinc oleate (0.9 g), magnesium oleate (0.1 g), and
OA (0.1784 mL) were dissolved in 1-octadecene (20 mL) and stirred
at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated to 320 °C
under nitrogen (at a rate of 3.3 min–1) and then
held at 320 °C for 60 min. The resulting solution was allowed
to cool, and the particles were precipitated with ethanol (80 mL).
The solution was centrifuged, forming a solid precipitate (20 °C,
504g, 6 min), and the supernatant was discarded.
The remaining solid precipitate was suspended in hexane (30 mL), producing
a suspension of ZnMgO NPs. MgO NPs were synthesized via the same method
by adding magnesium oleate (1.0 g) to OA and 1-octadecene and heating
to 320 °C.

2.2.2 DOPA-Capped NP Synthesis
ZnO_DOPA
NPs were synthesized as previously reported by Brown et al.40 Briefly ZnEt2 and 0.2 equiv of DOPA
are dissolved in toluene, and to this a 0.4 M solution of water (in
excess, 2 equiv used) in acetone is added dropwise to hydrolyze the
organometallic reagent. Acetone is then added to precipitate the formed
NPs, which are centrifuged, washed further with acetone, and left
to air-dry overnight. To incorporate Mg, a mixture of ZnEt2 and Mg(sec-Bu)(n-Bu) (0.7 M solution
in hexane) was hydrolyzed with the ligand using the same synthetic
protocol. A 9:1 ratio of Zn (300 mg, 2.43 mmol ZnEt2) and
Mg (268 mg 0.7 M solution, 0.27 mmol Mg(sec-Bu)(n-Bu)) reagents generated the desired 10% Mg doping level.

3 Methods
3.1 Material Preparation
Swelling solutions
for incorporating NPs into polyurethane were prepared by immersing
1 cm2 polymer squares into 1:1 hexane/DCM for OA-capped
NPs and toluene for DOPA-capped NPs. A NP concentration of 1 mg/mL
was used in both cases. The polymer samples were left to swell-encapsulate
for 24 h and then dipped into 0.001 M aqueous solution of CV in water
for 72 h (dark conditions). For the antibacterial investigation, control
samples (only solvent treated) and polymer samples containing only
NPs or CV were prepared.

3.2 Microbiology Assay
The following
1 cm2 polyurethane samples were used: (1) solvent-treated
sample (control), (2) NP-encapsulated polymer (MgO_OA, ZnMgO_OA, ZnMgO_DOPA,
and ZnO_DOPA), (3) CV-coated polymer and (4) NP-encapsulated and CV-coated
polymer (CVMgO_OA, CVZnMgO_OA, CVZnMgO_DOPA, and CVZnO_DOPA). The
antibacterial activities of these samples were tested against those
of E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus 8325-4,41 and
an epidemic strain of MRSA (EMRSA-16; S. aureus NCTC 13143), which is representative of one of the two types of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains
that dominate in UK hospitals.42 These
organisms were stored at −70 °C in Brain–Heart-Infusion
broth (BHI; Oxoid) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and propagated onto
either MacConkey agar (Oxoid) in the case of E. coli or mannitol salt agar (Oxoid) in the case of MRSA for a maximum
of two subcultures at intervals of 2 weeks.

The BHI broth was
inoculated with one bacterial colony and cultured in air at 37 °C
for 18 h, with shaking at 200 rpm. The bacterial pellet was recovered
by centrifugation (20 °C , 2867.2g, 5 min),
washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mL), and centrifuged
again to recover the pellet (20 °C, 2867.2g,
5 min), and the bacteria were finally resuspended in PBS (10 mL).
The washed suspension was diluted 1000-fold to achieve an inoculum
of ∼106 cfu/mL. In each experiment, the inoculum
was confirmed by plating 10-fold serial dilutions on agar for viable
counts. Triplicates of each polymer sample type were inoculated with
25 μL of the inoculum and covered with a sterile coverslip (2.2
cm2). The samples were then irradiated for up to 6 h using
either (a) a white-light source (General Electric 28 W Watt Miser
compact fluorescent lamp) emitting an average light intensity of 6600
lx or (b) a white-light source used for general laboratory usage,
emitting an average light intensity of 500 lx. A further set of samples
was incubated in the dark for the same irradiation time.

After
incubation, the inoculated samples and coverslips were added
to PBS (450 μL) and mixed using a vortex mixer. The neat suspension
and 10-fold serial dilutions were plated on agar for viable counts
and incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h (E.
coli) or 48 h (S. aureus). The experiment was repeated three times, and the statistical significance
of the following comparisons was analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test: (1) control (polymer only) versus inoculum, (2)
CV or NP versus control, (3) CV and NP versus CV alone.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 NP Synthesis and Characterization
Oleate-capped NPs were synthesized via a thermal decomposition
method
adapted from Park et al.39 Metal oleate
complexes were prepared by a salt metathesis reaction of a metal chloride
and sodium oleate and heated up to 320 °C. Magnesium chloride
was used instead of zinc chloride to synthesize magnesium oleate for
MgO NPs, and a 9:1 ratio of zinc oleate and magnesium oleate was used
to synthesize ZnMgO NPs. TEM images (Figures 1 and 2) and energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded, illustrating the discrepancies
between the size and morphology of the NPs, despite having been synthesized
using the same method. The MgO NPs were irregular in shape and formed
clusters of up to 200–300 nm in diameter. TEM images of ZnMgO
showed monodispersity, forming hexagonal truncated triangular plates
(15 nm in average diameter size). The EDX spectra showed that the
elemental composition of ZnMgO produced desired ratios well within
the error limits, but the presence of magnesium in MgO NPs was difficult
to detect (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
XRD revealed a single phase for the doped ZnMgO NPs, corresponding
to Wurtzite ZnO, suggesting that the Mg is intimately doped within
the lattice, with no indication of a secondary phase (Figure S5). Analysis of the linewidths of the
diffraction peaks using the Scherrer equation defined ZnMgO crystallites
to have sizes of 5–10 nm, slightly smaller than those observed
by TEM. It is possible that the larger particles observed by microscopy
are made up of clusters of smaller crystallites.

MgO NPs and (c, d) ZnMgO NPs.

Figure 2 Diagram illustrating ZnO NPs capped with (a) OA and (b) DOPA.

On the basis of a Tauc plot (Figure S2), the band onset of oleate-capped ZnMgO
NPs suspended in hexane
was estimated to be 3.34 eV (similar to that of bulk ZnO, 3.3 eV),
indicating that ZnMgO NPs are likely to act as UV-activated photocatalysts
(<385 nm) and therefore should not exhibit significant white-light-activated
bactericidal activity. As MgO NPs typically absorb at <159 nm,
which is within the region that a solvent absorbs strongly in, it
was not possible to determine the band gap of the oleate-capped MgO
NPs suspended in hexane.

DOPA-capped NPs were synthesized by
a method adapted by Brown et
al.,22,40 that is, by the controlled hydrolysis of
ZnEt2 in the presence of 0.2 equiv of DOPA. Likewise, DOPA-capped
ZnMgO NPs were synthesized by hydrolyzing a 9:1 ratio of ZnEt2 and MgBu2 with the ligand. The sizes of the particles
were determined from the XRD spectra (Figures S5–S7) using the Scherrer equation and gave estimated
diameters of 2.2 (±0.3) and 2.8 (±0.2) nm for the ZnO and
ZnMgO samples, respectively. The Mg-doped sample showed only one phase
in the XRD spectrum, corresponding to Wurtzite ZnO; this gives us
confidence that the Mg is well doped within the ZnO lattice. Inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to
confirm a 9:1 ratio of Zn/Mg in the doped sample. UV spectroscopy
allows the determination of the band gap of these particles, with
estimated band gaps of 3.7 (±0.1) and 3.6 (±0.1) eV, respectively
(Figures S3 and S4).

4.2 Material Synthesis and Characterization
NPs were impregnated
into medical-grade polyurethane (1 cm2 squares).19−22 Optimal incorporation of the NPs throughout the substrate was achieved
by immersing the polymer squares in the NP swelling solutions for
24 h. A 1:1 ratio of hexane/DCM was used to encapsulate oleate-capped
NPs, and toluene was used to swell-encapsulate DOPA-capped ZnO NPs
into the polymer. The NP-incorporated polymers were subsequently dipped
in a CV solution (0.001 M in distilled water, 72 h), resulting in
polyurethane incorporating the following antimicrobial combinations:(a) CV- and OA-capped
metal oxide NPs:
CVMgO_OA, CVZnMgO_OA, and CVZnO_OA.11 CVZnO_OA has been included in the discussion of
material characterization for comparison with other oleate-capped
NPs.20



(b) CV- and DOPA-capped metal oxide NPs:
CVZnMgO_DOPA and CVZnO_DOPA.



The modified
polyurethane samples were analyzed using
UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy. Because of the low concentration
of NPs encapsulated in the polymer samples, no characteristic UV–vis
absorption peaks in the visible region were observed. CV-coated polyurethane
showed an absorbance maximum at λ = 590 nm, with a shoulder
peak at λ = 548. The addition of NPs increased both the intensity
and breadth of the CV peak for CVZnO_OA and CVZnO_DOPA samples. This
trend continued for CVZnMgO_OA and CVZnMgO_DOPA, and for CVMgO_OA,
the absorption reached its maximum. This was expected, as CVMgO_OA
was darker in color than any other sample (Figure S8).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used
to determine whether
the NPs were localized at the polymer surface or encapsulated throughout
the bulk (Figure S9). XPS of CVZnMgO_OA
did not show evidence of Mg (1s); however, a weak Mg peak was observed
at 1304.0 eV for the CVMgO_OA sample. Notably, XPS has a detection
limit of ∼0.1 atom %, indicating that MgO was present at a
low concentration, correlating with the EDX data. XPS showed the presence
of zinc on the surface of CVZnMgO_OA, with a doublet in the Zn (2p)
region indicating Zn in ZnO. The XPS depth profile data demonstrated
a decrease in zinc content within the polymer bulk. Peaks in the C
(1s) region, N (1s) region, and O (1s) region were observed in the
control and metal oxide NP-incorporated samples. A doublet in the
Zn (2p) region was also indicated on the surface and within the polymer
substrate for CVZnO_DOPA and CVZnMgO_DOPA. A peak in the Mg (1s) region
was present for CVZnMgO_DOPA within the polymer substrate, but there
was little indication of Mg (1s) present on the surface of the polymer.

Static equilibrium water contact measurements (∼5.0 μL)
of all samples tested for antibacterial activity were recorded under
standard laboratory conditions (Table S1). The results showed negligible differences between the hydrophobicities
of the untreated and modified polyurethane samples (varying ±8°
in contact angle). The photostability of CV, CVZnO_DOPA, and CVZnMgO_DOPA
samples was examined with an ∼3880 lx white-light source for
up to 60 days (Figure S10). UV–vis
spectroscopy showed that CVZnO_DOPA and CVZnMgO_DOPA were photostable
over a 60 day period, demonstrating 29 and 31% photodegradation, respectively,
compared to that of CV (38%). This suggests that the materials are
likely to exhibit long-term photostability under standard lighting
within healthcare environments.

To encapsulate the NPs into
polymers, certain solvents can be used
to induce polymer swelling, such that NPs can diffuse through the
polymer matrix.43 In this investigation,
the NPs used were dispersed in different solvents: hexane for the
oleate-capped NPs and toluene for the DOPA-capped NPs. Consequently,
swelling measurements were conducted to ensure that in both cases
the polymers swelled to the same extent. Immersion of the polymer
samples in the DOPA-capped NP/toluene suspension for 24 h resulted
in a 142% increase in the polymer size. In contrast to toluene, hexane
is a poor solvent for polymer swelling and thus the oleate-capped
NP swelling solution was optimized to a 1:1 ratio of hexane/DCM such
that comparable swelling was achieved. This optimization should minimize
differences in the concentrations of encapsulated NPs induced by polymer
swelling. Additionally, a higher ratio of DCM compared to that of
hexane (7.5:2.5) resulted in deformation of the polymer samples after
swell-encapsulation; therefore, it was necessary to use a swelling
solution that did not alter the appearance and properties of the sample
for control purposes.

4.3 Microbiological Investigation
4.3.1 Oleate-Capped NPs
The antibacterial
activity of the oleate-capped NP-encapsulated polyurethane samples
was tested against S. aureus 8325-441,42 and E. coli ATCC 25922 as representative
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively (Figures 3 and 4), using a protocol described by Sehmi et al.20 The bactericidal effects of the following polyurethane
samples were tested: (1) control polymer, (2) CV-coated polymer (CV),
(3) metal oxide NP-encapsulated polymers (MgO_OA, ZnMgO_OA, ZnO_OA),
and (4) CV-coated and metal oxide NP-encapsulated polymers (CVMgO_OA,
CVZnMgO_OA, CVZnO_OA). The samples were exposed to a white-light source,
emitting an average light intensity of 6600 ± 900 lx at a distance
of 25 cm from the samples, for up to 4 h. A further set of samples
was tested in the dark for the same time periods. For completeness,
the photobactericidal activity of the MgO_OA and ZnMgO_OA samples
synthesized in this study are compared to that of ZnO_OA and CVZnO_OA
previously described by Sehmi et al. (Figures 3 and 4).20

experimental replicates.

of 25 cm from the samples. *Bacterial counts were reduced to below
the detection limit of 100 cfu/mL. OA indicates NPs synthesized with
OA capping. Error bars are based on the standard deviation of three
experimental replicates.

Figure 3a
illustrates
the bactericidal activity of all of the samples tested against S. aureus 8325-4 following 1 h of incubation in the
dark. Only samples containing combinations of NPs and dye resulted
in significant killing of S. aureus 8325-4 (∼1.5 log; P = 0.002). However,
after 1 h of white-light exposure (Figure 3b), CV and CVMgO_OA resulted in an ∼2 log
reduction in S. aureus 8325-4. CVZnMgO_OA
and CVZnO_OA samples caused complete killing, with CVZnO_OA reducing
the bacterial numbers to below the detection limit (P = 0.002). Within 2 h of incubation, CVMgO_OA, CVZnMgO_OA, and CVZnO_OA
samples all demonstrated highly significant bactericidal activity
against S. aureus 8325-4 (≥4 log
reduction; P = 0.002), under both white-light and
dark conditions (Figure S11). Moreover,
irradiated CV-coated samples also reduced S. aureus 8325-4 levels to below the detection limit within this time period.

These samples were subsequently tested against E.
coli ATCC 25922 (Figure 4), and it was found that within 2 h the CV
sample achieved an ∼0.5 log reduction in bacterial numbers
under white-light activation. The presence of NPs enhanced this effect,
with the CVZnMgO_OA sample resulting in a 1 log reduction in
bacterial numbers and CVZnO_OA achieving a 2.5 log reduction
(P = 0.002). Incubation in the dark for 4 h resulted
in considerable activity against E. coli ATCC 25922, with bacterial numbers reduced to below the detection
limit with the CVZnO_OA sample (Figure 4b). Note that 4 h of irradiation of all CV-incorporated
samples resulted in potent photobactericidal activity (≥4 log; P = 0.002).

4.3.2 DOPA-Capped NPs
The bactericidal
properties of the polyurethane samples encapsulated with DOPA-capped
ZnO and ZnMgO NPs were also tested against E. coli. However, in this case the activities of the samples were enhanced
using a low-intensity white-light source (500 ± 300 lx), comparable
to the dim lighting in a hospital environment, which can range from
10 000 to 200 lx.44 The polymer
squares were exposed to ambient laboratory lighting conditions on
a laboratory bench. To test the materials using conditions close to
the real-world situation in other respects, the bacterial suspension
in contact with the material was not covered with a coverslip and
the samples were not placed in a humidity chamber. We have used coverslips
previously to ensure close, uniform contact between the bacteria and
the hydrophobic polymer surface, and a humidity chamber was used to
prevent evaporation. It should be noted that in the absence of a coverslip
there was no visible evidence that the bacterial suspension dried
up over the course of the experiment.

The photobactericidal
properties of the following polyurethane samples were tested: (1)
control polymer, (2) CV-coated polymer (CV), (3) NP-encapsulated polymers
(ZnMgO_DOPA, ZnO_DOPA), and (4) CV- and NP-encapsulated polymers (CVZnMgO_DOPA,
CVZnO_DOPA). As the MgO_OA polyurethane sample did not effectively
reduce bacterial numbers, DOPA-capped MgO NPs were not synthesized
or tested for antibacterial activity. DOPA-capped ZnO NPs and DOPA-capped-ZnMgO
NPs were much smaller in size than the corresponding oleate-capped
NPs (2–4 nm compared to 15–18 nm).

In the dark
(Figure 5a), no bactericidal
activity was detected for the control sample,
CV-coated polyurethane, and ZnMgO_DOPA-encapsulated polyurethane when
incubated with E. coli ATCC 25922 for
2 h. However, within 3 h in the dark (Figure 5c), a significant reduction in bacterial
numbers (∼2 log; P = 0.002) was noted
for the ZnO_DOPA samples on their own, with an ∼0.5 log
enhancement in bactericidal activity upon incorporation of CV (2.5 log,
CVZnO_DOPA sample). The ZnMgO sample CVZnMgO_DOPA, however, showed
a comparatively reduced activity, with an ∼1 log reduction
in bacterial numbers (P = 0.002) in the dark. Irradiation
of the CV samples using standard laboratory lighting for 2 h (Figure 5b) resulted in some
photoactivated antibacterial activity (∼0.7 log reduction),
whereas the ZnO_DOPA samples showed similar antibacterial efficacies
under light and dark conditions after 2 h (∼2 log reduction).
These findings suggest that the bactericidal mechanism of the ZnO_DOPA
sample is via a nonphotoactivated route, for example, absorption by
the bacteria or coordination of the bacteria to the ZnO surface. The
CVZnMgO_DOPA and CVZnO_DOPA samples induced lethal photosensitization
of E. coli ATCC 25922; the former resulted
in a 2 log reduction (P = 0.002), whereas
the latter reduced the bacterial numbers to below the detection limit
(≥4 log; P = 0.002) within 3 h of irradiation.

These samples incorporated with

an epidemic strain of MRSA (EMRSA-16; S. aureus NCTC 13143) using white-light irradiation (∼500 lx). These
samples were not placed in a humidity chamber, and no coverslip was
used, to mimic the conditions of real-world exposure. In the dark,
only the CVZnO_DOPA and CVZnMgO_DOPA samples demonstrated bactericidal
activity against S. aureus NCTC 13143
(∼1 log; P = 0.002; Figure 6a). The ZnMgO_DOPA, ZnO_DOPA,
and CV samples showed limited photoactivated antimicrobial activities,
reducing the numbers of S. aureus NCTC
13143 by 0.4 log, 0.6 log, and 0.8 log, respectively,
within 2 h of white-light irradiation (500 lx; Figure 6b). However, the CV–NP combinations
demonstrated enhanced photobactericidal activities: CVZnMgO_DOPA caused
a 2 log reduction in the numbers of S. aureus NCTC 13143 (P = 0.002), whereas the CVZnO_DOPA
sample was the most efficacious and reduced the bacterial numbers
to below the detection limit (≥4 log; P = 0.002).

These results demonstrate the
increased efficacy of ZnO NPs (both
DOPA-capped and oleate-capped) when combined with CV, compared to
that of MgO or ZnMgO. Note that two methods for Mg doping of ZnO were
attempted, and neither achieved enhanced antibacterial activity compared
to that of ZnO. Moreover, ZnO_DOPA-encapsulated polyurethane demonstrated
the highest bactericidal activity against E. coli ever reported for ZnO-incorporated materials (with and without white-light
activation) (Figure 4c,d). This may be attributed to the small size of ZnO_DOPA NPs (∼2–4
nm) compared to that of ZnO_OA NPs (∼18 nm). Previous studies
have shown that smaller NPs are more effective at reducing the numbers
of E. coli.30 This is presumably accounted for by the easier penetration of small
NPs through the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria, enabling them to
reach targets in the cytoplasm.45,46

4.3.3 Comparison between DOPA- and OA-Capped ZnMgO
NPs
Additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the
antibacterial activity of CVZnMgO_DOPA against S. aureus 8325-4 and E. coli ATCC 25922 at
a range of light intensities and incubation periods (Table 1). Both the CVZnMgO_DOPA and
CVZnMgO_OA samples achieved a 3 log reduction against S. aureus 8325-4 within 1 h of ∼6600 lx white-light
exposure. However, in the dark, within the same time period, CVZnMgO_DOPA
does not demonstrate any significant antibacterial activity, whereas
CVZnMgO_OA samples reduce the bacterial numbers by ∼1.5 log.
Moreover, on incubation for 2 h in the dark, the CVZnMgO_OA sample
reduces the bacterial numbers to below the detection limit, compared
to the CVZnMgO_DOPA sample, which only causes a 0.5 log reduction
in S. aureus 8325-4 numbers (Figure S10).

Table 1b summarizes
the performance of CVZnMgO samples when tested against E. coli ATCC 25922 under different lighting and incubation
conditions. Both CVZnMgO_DOPA and CVZnMgO_OA demonstrate similar antibacterial
efficacies in the dark within 4 h. This is unsurprising, as it has
been previously noted that OA-capped NPs enhance bactericidal activity
in the dark when tested against E. coli ATCC 25922.47 However, distinct differences
in the antibacterial performance were observed upon 2 h of white-light
exposure, where the CVZnMgO_DOPA sample reduced E.
coli numbers twice as effectively as the CVZnMgO_OA
sample.

These results suggest that the capping ligand plays
a crucial role
in the bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such
that CV samples containing oleate-capped ZnMgO NPs are more efficacious
than those containing equivalent DOPA-capped NPs. This enhanced activity
may be attributed to the bactericidal properties of the oleate ligand
itself. Similar bactericidal activities in the dark were observed
by Noimark et al. for TiO2–- and Au/TiO2–-encapsulated silicone samples.47 Here, the NPs were capped with OA, which has
been observed to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, such
as S. aureus.47 CVZnO_DOPA and ZnO_DOPA displayed greater antibacterial activity
against E. coli and MRSA than CVZnMgO_DOPA
and ZnMgO_DOPA under the light and dark conditions (Figure 5). However, the ZnO_DOPA and
ZnMgO_DOPA samples displayed similar levels of Zn2+ leaching
(Table S2), which indicates that leaching
is not entirely responsible for the observed bactericidal activity
in the dark. Additionally, ZnMgO_OA and ZnMgO_DOPA demonstrated similar
levels of Zn2+ and Mg2+ leaching (Table S2), yet CVZnMgO_OA and CVZnMgO_DOPA exhibited
different bactericidal activities against S. aureus 8325-4 after 1 h (∼1.5 log reduction and no reduction
in bacteria, respectively). Thus, the minimal amounts of leaching
that occur from the modified polymer samples are not responsible for
their antibacterial activities.

MgO-incorporated polyurethane
exhibited poor activity against both
bacteria. However, CVMgO-incorporated samples were effective against S. aureus 8325-4. This provides further evidence
to suggest that the OA-capped agent is able to kill S. aureus 8325-4 when combined with CV, as no bactericidal
activity was observed against E. coli ATCC 25922 on using CVMgO_OA under light or dark conditions within
2 h (Figure S12). We have shown that the
addition of Mg as a dopant to ZnO NPs is detrimental to their antibacterial
activity; further studies are underway to probe the surface and electronic
properties of ZnMgO_DOPA NPs to attempt to understand the effect of
this added Mg.

Polyurethane encapsulated with DOPA-capped NPs
was tested against
an epidemic strain of MRSA (EMRSA-16; S. aureus NCTC 13143) that is rife in hospitals throughout the United Kingdom.41,42,48 To mimic more closely the conditions
of natural exposure of the bacteria to the material, the experiment
was carried out without using a coverslip or a humidity chamber. The
CVZnO_DOPA sample induced lethal photosensitization of S. aureus NCTC 13143, resulting in a ≥4 log
reduction in the bacterial numbers, whereas CVZnMgO_DOPA achieved
an ∼2.5 log reduction within 2 h of irradiation.

This article presents a detailed study on the effects of the presence
of CV, NP size, NP-capping ligand, Mg doping, and light intensity
conditions on the antibacterial activity of polyurethane. Doping of
ZnO with Mg did not result in an enhancement of the antibacterial
activity under either light or dark conditions when the samples were
tested against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In line
with the previous literature,30,31,49−51 the greatest bactericidal activity was exhibited
when smaller NPs were used. However, when the NPs were incorporated
with CV, the antibacterial activity of the samples could be further
enhanced by tuning the NP capping group. Modification of the NP surfaces
with different capping agents can alter their toxicities, causing
differences between ROS generation and Zn2+ release.

The possible mechanisms for the antibacterial activity of ZnO NPs
include ROS formation and oxidative stress,20 Zn2+ release,30 electrostatic
interaction,23,30 and internalization of the NPs
into the bacteria.23 Bacterial cell walls
have an overall negative charge, which facilitates electrostatic interactions
between the bacteria and CV and Zn2+ on the surface of
the polymer, assisting in bacterial killing. In this study, differences
in the antibacterial activities of ZnO-incorporated samples were apparent
between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, presumably as a
result of differences in the cell-wall structures: Gram-positive bacteria
have a thick peptidoglycan layer (20–80 nm), whereas Gram-negative
bacteria have a thinner layer of peptidoglycan (7–8 nm) and
a second outer membrane.52 In keeping with
previous studies,18−22,42,51 Gram-negative bacteria were found to be less susceptible to dye-
and NP-incorporated polymeric surfaces. This may be due to the reduced
penetration of radicals through the double cell membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria. Further studies will focus on testing the antibacterial
activities of these surfaces against more strains to understand the
differences between bacterial reduction of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. It is possible that the smaller NPs are able to penetrate
through the bacterial cell wall more effectively than the larger 15–18
nm NPs. The fact that polyurethane containing ZnO_DOPA, which is only
3 nm in size, shows antibacterial activity under light and dark conditions
without CV (Figures 5 and 6) supports this argument. The killing
by ZnO_DOPA observed in the dark also suggests that nonphotoactivated
bactericidal activity occurs, either because NPs penetrate into the
bacterial cells or because they produce ROS by interacting with defects
on the polymer surface. Further tests were performed to examine whether
the amount of ZnO NP leaching (shown in Table S2) was sufficient to reduce the bactericidal activity of ZnO_DOPA.
The samples were immersed in water for 48 h and then removed and tested
against E. coli ATCC 25922. The antibacterial
activity of ZnO_DOPA did not differ under the light or dark condition
after immersion in water (data not shown), which indicates that leaching
of the ZnO NPs is not sufficient to reduce the bactericidal activity
of the polymer. Zinc leaching is shown to tail off over time, as all
“loose” Zn is lost, which is also shown by Noimark et
al.22

Typically, ZnO NPs have a wide
band gap (3.53 eV for DOPA-capped
ZnO),22 requiring UV illumination for ROS
generation. However, because of the presence of pre-existing surface
defects on the NPs, gap states can produce ROS under lower-energy-light
illumination50 (i.e., visible light) and
even in the dark. Moreover, samples with combinations of NPs and CV
showed increased bactericidal activity in the dark. This may be due
to defects on the NP surface, in addition to the intrinsic bactericidal
properties of the dye itself. Previous studies have shown that the
incorporation of a combination of ZnO and CV into polyurethane can
enhance the antibacterial activity of the dye via both type I and
type II mechanistic pathways.20 It is anticipated
that these bactericidal surfaces will produce photogenerated species
that can oxidize organic contaminants on the surface so that they
maintain their bactericidal properties. Additionally, bacterial resistance
is unlikely to occur as these surfaces operate via multiple attack
mechanisms. These polymers have demonstrated considerable antibacterial
activity against a higher bacterial load than that likely to occur
in a clinical setting: ∼1 × 105 cfu/cm–2 of bacteria used in this investigation compared to
∼1 × 102 cfu/cm–2 found in
hospitals.22,53,54

5 Conclusions
For
the first time, polymers containing NPs and dye were tested
against an epidemic isolate of MRSA (EMRSA-16; S. aureus NCTC 13143) under laboratory lighting conditions (∼13×
less intense than the lighting conditions in previous studies performed
by our group). These experiments were conducted on the bench, with
no barrier (coverslip) between the inoculum and the environment, to
determine the efficacy of these antimicrobial polymers under conditions
similar to those found naturally. Oleate-capped NPs combined with
CV are biocompatible and highly effective at reducing the numbers
of Gram-positive bacteria, possibly due to the antibacterial properties
of the oleate ligand itself. ZnO_DOPA (2–4 nm) was able to
reduce the numbers of E. coli without
a need for a photosensitizer or white-light activation. We observed
highly significant bactericidal activity by CVZnO_DOPA against an
epidemic strain of MRSA. This study established polyurethane incorporated
with CV and ZnO or ZnMgO NPs as a highly effective antibacterial surface,
under conditions that mimic natural exposure in clinical environments.
This technology shows promise for use in hospitals to reduce bacterial
surface contamination and, ultimately, the risk for HCAIs.
