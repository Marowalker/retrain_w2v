The
numerical model HydratiCA was used to simulate the reaction kinetics
of alkali-activated metakaolin, a material belonging to a class of
sustainable binders alternative to Portland cement. The full chemistry
of the system, including solid phases and aqueous species, is taken
into account in these simulations. Specifically, metakaolin dissolution,
reaction product nucleation and growth, and ion speciation, and diffusion
in solution are simulated. The sodium aluminosilicate (N–A–S–H),
formed by the reaction of metakaolin in alkaline solution, is implemented
in the model as a combination of co-precipitating pseudo-zeolitic
phases, with variable stoichiometry. The results show how variations
of the reaction pathways, occurring when alkaline activators of different
composition and concentration are used, can be associated with different
macroscopic behaviors in terms of mechanical performance and durability.
Reconciling these macroscopic properties with the basic chemical processes
will be a fundamental technological challenge for the deployment of
sustainable technologies in the construction industry.

1 Introduction
The
sustainable development goals outlined in the United Nations 2030
Agenda include actions oriented at mitigating climate change, building
resilient infrastructures, and promoting the development of sustainable
cities.1 This need of imagining a sustainable
future has boosted cement chemistry research aimed at defining a new
generation of green building materials. Among the possible innovative
alternatives to Portland cement, alkali-activated materials (also
named geopolymers) represent a viable solution, with a consolidated
scientific literature. Lack of internationally recognized standards
and regulations2 has so far hindered the
use of alkali-activated cements in practical applications, although
actions are being taken in this direction.3

The concept beyond this class of cements is the replacement
of limestone (impure CaCO3), as a primary raw material,
with aluminosilicates from various sources. The production of Portland
cement by CaCO3 calcination bears a huge environmental
footprint because one mole of CO2 is emitted for each mole
of processed CaCO3.

In alkali-activated cements,
reaction products are formed by alkaline hydrolysis of precursor aluminosilicates.
In this context, clay is a widely available and economically viable
raw material for the supply of Al–Si reactants to be used for
alkali activation. The simplest clay mineral, in terms of chemistry,
is kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), which upon calcination over a temperature range of 550–800
°C releases water vapor and transforms to the dehydroxylated
form Al2Si2O7, commonly referred
to as metakaolin (although metakaolinite would be a more appropriate
definition). Partial or total loss of its crystalline structure, subsequent
to thermal treatment, enhances its reactivity in alkaline environment.
Extensive literature on the properties of alkali-activated metakaolin
can be found in review papers.4−7

Despite the extensive research performed on
such materials, specific details of the reaction pathways leading
to the formation of a hardened material from the dissolution of metakaolin
in alkaline solution remain uncertain and are still a matter of debate.
The implementation of mathematical models may bridge the gap between
the empirical knowledge of the macroscopic properties of alkali-activated
metakaolin and the associated physical and chemical processes operating
at small scales. A knowledge-based approach will likely drive a faster
and more robust innovation in the design of such materials.

Progress in this direction has been made by a number of studies that
used atomistic simulations to quantitatively assess, at small space
and time scales, structural breakup during metakaolin dissolution,8 clustering of Al–Si units,9 and nanostructural details of the product of aluminosilicate
alkali activation.10,11 The reaction kinetics of alkali-activated
systems has been simulated by empirical models,12,13 which, however, did not explicitly describe the full chemistry and
mineralogy of the system.

In this study, the dissolution–precipitation
kinetics of metakaolin in alkali solution is simulated using the cellular
automaton reaction–diffusion model HydratiCA. By defining a
database of chemical reactions, each described by a specific stoichiometry,
with direct and inverse rates, the time-dependent concentration of
metakaolin, reaction product, and aqueous species is tracked over
a time interval of hours.

The implementation of this numerical
model is intended to provide possible answers to questions such as:What are the underlying mechanisms
inducing the observed differences in terms of macroscopic properties
(e.g., setting time, mechanical strength) when different alkali activators
are used?

How do the rates of nucleation
and growth and stoichiometry of the reaction product change when the
alkali concentration is varied?



This
numerical study represents a starting point for the definition of
a detailed quantitative description of the chemical kinetics inherent
to alkali activated systems.

2 Computational Methods
2.1 Overview
The HydratiCA model was developed at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology on the basis of a cellular automaton
algorithm for the simulation of reaction-transport processes.14,15 HydratiCA has been successfully used for the simulation of systems
related to Portland cement;16−20 however, the flexibility of this model allows different chemical
systems to be simulated.21,22

The computational
domain is built by mapping the phases present in the system as discrete
units of concentration, called cells, onto a mesh of lattice sites
with a given lattice spacing λ. At each discrete time step τ,
the system’s evolution is simulated by changing the number
of cells of each component at each lattice site according to a set
of stochastic rules that model the diffusive transport of the aqueous
species and the chemical reactions occurring between components within
a given neighborhood of a lattice site. These stochastic reaction-transport
equations converge to the continuum standard rate laws and the diffusion
equation in the limit λ, τ → 0.

The user
defines the physicochemical properties of the phases present in the
system as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing
diffusive transport and chemical reactions.

A generic dissolution–precipitation
equilibrium of the type 1  is simulated by assigning an equilibrium constant
(or solubility product) Keq and a rate
constant k+ for the direct reaction (dissolution
in the case of eq 1).
At each time step, the occurrence of dissolution or precipitation
depends on the value of the supersaturation S at
each lattice site. The value of the rate constant for the inverse
reaction is simply k– = k+/Keq.

Precipitation
of a new solid phase can occur, provided that this has previously
nucleated at locations of the spatial domain where the supersaturation
is high enough. The nucleation rate is defined, based on classical
nucleation theory, by the following equation 2  The pre-exponential factor A is defined as 3  and the dimensionless
parameter W is 4  The parameters present in eqs 3 and 4 are the volume
occupied by a molecule of the newly formed phase in the nucleus (v0), the surface energy at the interface nucleus/solution
(σ), the diffusion coefficient of the solute species (D), and the thermal energy kBT (with kB being the
Boltzmann constant).

A detailed description of the algorithm,
along with its validation, can be found in the literature cited at
the beginning of this section.

2.2 System
Definition
The system simulated in this study consists of
a single metakaolin platelet having a size of 9 × 9 × 3
μm3, in aqueous solution, with a water/metakaolin
mass ratio of 0.56. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the
computational domain of 11 × 11 × 5 voxels (1 μm/voxel).
Such an idealized small system was chosen to minimize computational
time, considering that the focus of this investigation is to understand
the reaction kinetics rather than the microstructural evolution of
the system. The alkaline activators used in the simulations were sodium
silicate (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Three different runs were performed, each with a different combination
of activator and molar concentration (Table 1). The selected molar concentrations are
close to those typically used in experiments and correspond to bulk
molar Na/Al ratios ≤1, which are commonly recommended to avoid
efflorescence.23

The reaction product of alkali-activated metakaolin
consists in a sodium aluminosilicate hydrate, named N–A–S–H,
following the convention used for Portland cement phases (N = Na2O; A = Al2O3; S = SiO2; H
= H2O). This phase is characterized by an X-ray diffraction
pattern typical of amorphous or semi-amorphous matter and, in the
published literature, is also referred to as N–A–S–H
gel, aluminosilicate gel, or geopolymer gel, although the use of the
term “gel” is too generic and does not provide a clear
picture about the small-scale structural nature of this phase. The
bulk chemical composition of N–A–S–H is affine
to that of sodium zeolites and, although the exact nature, composition,
structure, and even nomenclature of this phase is still debated, recent
evidence based on atomistic models and total scattering data10 confirmed the hypothesis that this phase consists
of defective nanocrystalline zeolitic domains.24 On the basis of the above considerations, N–A–S–H
is implemented in the model as a solid with variable stoichiometry,
in which the chemical variability is simulated by co-precipitation
of four zeolitic end-members, similar to the approach used to simulate
calcium-silicate hydrates (C–S–H) precipitation in Portland
cement systems.16 This allows a reaction
product of variable chemical composition to precipitate, depending
on the aqueous solution composition. In the absence of thermodynamic
and kinetic data relative to the N–A–S–H product,
the use of a combination of zeolitic phases represents a valid approximation,
given the chemical and structural affinity of these phases. A similar
approach was used to simulate the formation of N–A–S–H
at thermodynamic equilibrium, in a thermodynamic model of alkali-activated
cement.25 The selected end-members include
zeolite phases that are commonly observed in Na-activated systems,
such as zeolite A, Na-faujasite, and zeolites of the sodalite series.24,26 Other commonly occurring zeolites in such systems are natrolite27,28 and analcime.29 Although other zeolitic
phases may form under a variety of chemical compositions and curing
conditions, it is stressed here that the phases selected are not intended
to cover the whole range of crystalline zeolite phases, but rather
to span a wide enough compositional interval for the N–A–S–H
model. The properties of the solid phases and the set of reactions
implemented in the model are reported in Tables 2 and 3.

The first reaction listed
in Table 3 accounts
for metakaolin dissolution. Quantitative data on metakaolin solubility
are not available, and the equilibrium constant was calculated using
the formation enthalpy and entropy data retrieved from literature.30 Strictly speaking, the equilibrium constant
obtained from this reaction does not represent a solubility product.
However, written in this form, this chemical equation stresses the
dependence of metakaolin solubility upon solution pH.

Al(OH)4– was observed
to be the dominant Al species in strongly alkaline solutions.31 H3SiO4– and H2SiO42– are the
two dominant Si species in alkali-activated metakaolin systems,32 with the pH-dependent equilibrium between these
two species being controlled by the speciation equation reported in Table 3. The equilibrium
constant for this reaction was calculated from geochemical databases.33 In the absence of published data on the reaction
rate k+, the reported value was assumed
on the basis of the one used in a previous HydratiCA model for the
formation of Ca complexes in solution.17

The rate constant for metakaolin dissolution was calculated
using literature data from dissolution experiments34 performed at a liquid/metakaolin mass ratio of 100, considering
that at high dilution, the dissolution rate approximates the value
of the rate constant.

The equilibrium constants for the dissolution–precipitation
equilibrium of N–A–S–H were calculated from solubility
data for end-member N–A–S–Ha (zeolite A35), end-member N–A–S–Hb (analcime;36 zeolite Y37), and
end-member N–A–S–Hc (natrolite37). The equilibrium constant for end-member N–A–S–Hd
(hydro-sodalite) was calculated from a value of the Gibbs free energy
of the formation reported elsewhere.38

The values of the dissolution rate constants for the N–A–S–H
end-members were assigned on the basis of the data from a study on
zeolite dissolution.39 Although this value
is relative to zeolites with heulandite composition, in the absence
of more specific data, this value is assumed to be valid for all N–A–S–H
end-members. This selected dissolution rate constant k+ = 5.50 × 10–15 is in the range
of values relative to other Na-tectosilicates.40

The formation of aqueous Al–Si complexes subsequent
to metakaolin dissolution, which is often postulated on the basis
of NMR data,32,41,42 is not explicitly simulated. Such Si–Al entities are broadly
defined “oligomers” in the literature, relying on a
model dating back to 1959.43 However, this
term is a fairly generic one and is more often used in the field of
organic chemistry. Here, it is preferred to adopt the term “nucleus”
to describe nano-sized entities formed from the aggregation of aqueous
species. Therefore, the formation of Al–Si species, as precursors
of the final reaction product (a process that is generally referred
to as “oligomer condensation” in the literature) is
here regarded as a nucleation event and simulated using the mathematical
formalism expressed by eqs 2–4. This “nucleation”
formalism is considered more suitable for the description of the precipitation
of inorganic solids and is in line with the current views on phase
separation from aqueous solutions.44−46 In the present simulations,
the occurrence of N–A–S–H nucleation is restricted
to the surface of metakaolin (heterogeneous nucleation), based on
previous experimental evidence.41,42,47

The pre-exponential factor A and the energy
barrier W present in eq 2 were obtained by using values of the molecular volume v0 obtained from the molar mass and density48,49 of the N–A–S–H end-members. The diffusion coefficient D was set to 1 × 10–9 m2/s on the basis of the data from silica diffusivity.50 The value of the surface energy σ was set to 0.20
J/m2, which is in the range of suggested values for amorphous
silica.51

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Metakaolin Dissolution
The time-dependent volume fraction and dissolution rate of metakaolin
after 12 h of simulated reaction are displayed in Figure 1. Dissolution initially occurs
at a fast rate, which quickly decays within the first 30 min. Such
a fast reaction, restricted to the very early stage and followed by
a much slower rate of reaction, is commonly observed in indirect experimental
methods based on calorimetry performed on alkali-activated metakaolin
and other calcined clays.52−54

Figure 1 Volume fraction and dissolution rate for
the three simulated systems.

The results show that during this stage, dissolution occurs
at a faster rate for the system activated by sodium hydroxide, compared
to those activated by sodium silicate. The initial faster rate of
dissolution for hydroxide-activated metakaolin is due to the absence
of silicate ions in the solution at time zero, when metakaolin is
mixed with the alkaline solution, which makes the aqueous solution
more undersaturated with respect to metakaolin. For the silicate-activated
system, the rate of dissolution is proportional to the activator concentration
and hence the solution pH.

At 12 h of reaction, the amount of
metakaolin, in volume, decreased from 40 to 18% for the hydroxide-activated
system. A much smaller decrease is predicted for the silicate-activated
systems, with the amount of metakaolin at 12 h being 36 and 39% for
the 8 and 4 M solutions, respectively. However, after 12 h of reaction,
metakaolin dissolution for the silicate-activated systems proceeds
at a nearly constant rate, which is significantly higher compared
to the dissolution rate of the hydroxide-activated system, which conversely
keeps decreasing due to limited availability of Si in the solution,
which hinders N–A–S–H precipitation. Even assuming
a constant rate of dissolution for the hydroxide-activated system,
after 12 h, it can be predicted that a crossover in the amount of
consumed metakaolin occurs approximately after 4 days for the 8 M
Na2SiO3 system and after 13 days for the 4 M
Na2SiO3.

3.2 N–A–S–H
Precipitation
Fast metakaolin dissolution during the very
early stage of reaction releases Si and Al ions, which, in combination
with Na ions present in the alkaline activator, leads to a supersaturation
of the aqueous solution with respect to N–A–S–H. Figure 2 shows that, for
all three simulated systems, nucleation occurs within a few seconds
from contact between metakaolin and alkaline solution over a narrow
time interval resembling the site-saturation regime, i.e., nucleation
can be approximately described as a single event occurring at the
very beginning of the reaction. This nucleation behavior is analogous
to the one suggested for Portland cement, based on experimental evidence55 and numerical simulations.16 The total amount of N–A–S–H nuclei
formed, normalized to the metakaolin surface, is 3.22 × 1014 m–2 for the 8 mol/L Na2SiO3 system, 1.09 × 1012 m–2 for 4 mol/L Na2SiO3 and 2.06 × 1010 m–2 for 8 mol/L NaOH. The number of nuclei
formed is proportional to the solution supersaturation. During the
first few seconds, saturation with respect to N–A–S–H
is the lowest for the hydroxide-activated system because Si ions are
not initially present in the solution. For comparison, the number
of nuclei formed in Portland cement systems was estimated by kinetic
modeling to amount to 4.55 × 1011 m–2.56

Figure 2 Rate of N–A–S–H nucleation
for the three simulated systems.

After the rapid formation of nuclei at the interface between
metakaolin and aqueous solution, N–A–S–H precipitation
proceeds by growth. Given the lack of long-range order in the N–A–S–H
product, the term growth here does not refer to the incorporation
of structural units along specific crystallographic direction, but
rather to the attachment of multi-ion clusters to the bulk N–A–S–H
phase to form aggregates of poorly crystalline, highly defective nano-sized
entities. This process has been postulated to be an intermediate precipitation
step leading to the formation of disordered precursors of crystalline
phases.44

Figure 3 displays the time-dependent N–A–S–H
volume fraction and the rate of precipitation for the simulated systems.
In analogy to what was observed for metakaolin dissolution, fast early
stage precipitation of N–A–S–H occurs for the
hydroxide-activated system. Even in the presence of a smaller amount
of nuclei, for the hydroxide-activated system, N–A–S–H
precipitation occurs at a faster rate during the 1 h of the reaction
as a consequence of the fast release of chemical species by metakaolin
dissolution. However, at later stages, while N–A–S–H
precipitation in the silicate-activated system proceeds nearly at
steady state, a significant decrease in the rate of precipitation
is observed for the hydroxide-activated system, consistent with the
predicted decaying rate of metakaolin dissolution (Figure 1). Assuming that the precipitation
rates remain constant after 12 h, the amount of N–A–S–H
formed is predicted to become larger than that precipitated in the
hydroxide-activated system after 3 days for the systems activated
by 8 mol/L Na2SiO3 and 9 days for the one activated
by 4 mol/L Na2SiO3.

Figure 3 N–A–S–H
volume fraction and precipitation rate for the three simulated systems.

The predicted faster early-stage
rate of reaction in the presence of sodium hydroxide may induce a
quicker set, in agreement with previous experimental observations
performed on alkali-activated metakaolin, suggesting that setting
time is proportional to the activator Si/Na ratio.57,58 On the other hand, the predicted faster rate of N–A–S–H
precipitation at later stage, using Na2SiO3 as
alkaline activator, is consistent with the better mechanical performance
commonly observed in the presence of sodium-silicate as compared to
sodium hydroxide for metakaolin and other alkali-activated materials.5,52,59

The N–A–S–H
composition predicted by the simulations is dominated, for all systems,
by the N–A–S–Hc end-member (Table 2). Growth of the other end-members
is kinetically hindered during the first 12 h, when their volume fraction
is of the order of 10–8 or smaller. No significant
change was observed when the stoichiometry and equilibrium constant
of the N–A–S–Hb end-member were changed to reflect
analcime or zeolite Y chimico-physical properties (see Table 2). Therefore, the predicted
chemical composition of the reaction product tends to that of a phase
with Na/Al = 1 and Si/Al = 1.5.

3.3 Aqueous
Phase
Interestingly, the simulation results show that although
early-stage reaction kinetics are faster for the hydroxide-activated
system, the amount of water consumed after 12 h does not vary significantly
compared to the silicate-activated system. This behavior is illustrated
in Figure 4, which
shows that for a given amount of dissolved metakaolin, the amount
of water consumed is significantly smaller for the hydroxide-activated
system. The different amount of water consumed during the reaction,
depending on the activator used, is a consequence of the reaction
stoichiometry, and this point will be illustrated in more detail later
in this section. This result, moreover, agrees with previous investigation
showing that denser, less porous microstructures develop as the Si/Na
ratio of the alkaline activator is increased.60 Therefore, the better mechanical performance in the presence of
sodium silicate, compared to sodium hydroxide, can be attributed to
both a faster late-stage rate of N–A–S–H precipitation,
as shown in the previous Section 3.2, and enhanced water consumption, leading to the formation
of a denser microstructure.

Figure 4 Percentage of water consumed as a function of
the percentage of dissolved metakaolin.

The time-dependent concentrations of Na, Al, and Si ionic
species in aqueous solution are displayed in Figure 5. The pH of the pore solution after 12 h
is 13.67 for 8 mol/L Na2SiO3, 13.47 for 4 mol/L
Na2SiO3, and 13.12 for 8 mol/L NaOH (14.90,
14.60, and 14.90 at time zero), in agreement with the pH range measured
experimentally for alkali-activated metakaolin.61

Figure 5 Concentration of aqueous species expressed as mol/L.

Fast early-stage N–A–S–H precipitation
in the hydroxide-activated system is associated with a larger amount
of Na and Si aqueous species removed from the pore solution. However,
although the concentration of Al(OH)4– in the silicate-activated systems reaches
values as low as a few tens μmol, a much higher concentration
is predicted for the hydroxide-activated system. Interestingly, this
behavior was experimentally observed by NMR spectroscopy of alkali-activated
metakaolin.62 The results of those measurements
suggested the presence of Al(OH)4– in the pore solution only for hydroxide-activated
metakaolin, whereas no aqueous Al species could be detected in silicate-activated
systems. Additionally, the results indicated the presence of Na+ in the solution as a charge-balancing ion for Al(OH)4–.

Although the simulations predict a lower amount of Na+ at 12 h, the rate of Na+ consumption is 5–13 times
bigger for the silicate-activated systems at the end of the simulations.

To better understand these observations, it is convenient to write
chemical equations for silicate and hydroxide-activated systems with
Na/Al = 1, dominated by the precipitation of a N–A–S–H
product with Na/Al = 1 and Si/Al = 1.5, as predicted by the simulations 5   6  These equations imply thatfor each mole of metakaolin consumed,
more product is formed in the silicate-activated system;

for each mole of metakaolin consumed, more water is
consumed in the silicate-activated system;

excess Al(OH)4– and Na+ are present in the pore solution of the hydroxide-activated
system.

The presence of excess Na in the pore
solution may induce enhanced carbonation for hydroxide-activated metakaolin.
Indeed, this behavior was observed in an alkali-activated calcined
smectite system, in which the formation of alkali carbonates was detected
by XRD only when NaOH was used as an activator.54

3.4 Role of Keq and k+
The effect
of modifying the values of the N–A–S–H end-members
dissolution–precipitation equilibrium constants and dissolution
rate constants was investigated by running an additional set of simulations
for the three modeled systems. The criteria adopted for varying these
values were based on the selection of amorphous, rather than crystalline
end-members, as being representative of N–A–S–H.
Solubility studies on zeolite A showed that the solubility of the
ionic species increased up to 1 order of magnitude for the amorphous
precursor, compared to the crystalline phase.35 Based on this observation, the values of Keq were recalculated accordingly for all N–A–S–H
end-members. Moreover, based on the measured differences between quartz
and amorphous silica, the value of k+ was
increased by an order of magnitude.40 The
densities of the N–A–S–H end-members did not
vary compared to the previous simulations, based on the evidence from
atomistic models of N–A–S–H structures, which
displayed small variations in the density of crystalline, defective,
and amorphous structures, for stoichiometries with Si/Al ≤
2.10 The values of Keq and k+ adopted for this set
of simulations are summarized in Table 4. The time-dependent rates of metakaolin dissolution
and N–A–S–H precipitation are displayed in Figure 6. The most notable
difference is the delayed N–A–S–H nucleation,
which occurs after about 20 min for the 8 mol/L Na2SiO3 system and after nearly 3 h for the 8 mol/L NaOH system.
Nucleation does not occur during the first 12 h for the 4 mol/L Na2SiO3 system.

precipitation for the system with amorphous end-members.

Such a delayed N–A–S–H
nucleation affects the rate of metakaolin dissolution, which in this
case presents two distinct peaks: one at the beginning of the reaction
and the other immediately after the nucleation event.

The occurrence
of two distinct exothermic peaks, measured by isothermal calorimetry,
was observed in a previous investigation on the activation of metakaolin
by sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate. These peaks were located
at the beginning and after a few hours from the beginning of the reaction.
The separation between the two peaks was more pronounced at lower
temperatures, whereas the peaks became nearly overlapping at a temperature
of 40 °C, when the overall rate of reaction is faster.63,64

4 Conclusions
The HydratiCA model proved
to be a promising tool for simulating the reaction kinetics of alkali-activated
systems. The possibility of tracking the time-dependent evolution
of the amount of solid phases and aqueous species present in the system
represents a powerful resource for a better understanding of the basic
chemical processes associated with alkali-activated materials.

The results of the numerical simulations presented in this study
provided a picture of the influence of different alkaline activators
on the reaction pathways of metakaolin-based cement.

The main
findings of this numerical study suggest the following:The use of NaOH as alkaline activator
is associated with a fast early-stage rate of dissolution–precipitation,
which may explain the experimental observations suggesting that the
setting time depends on the Si/Na ratio of the alkaline activator.

Alkaline activation by Na2SiO3, in turn, induces a faster late-stage rate of metakaolin
dissolution and N–A–S–H precipitation, as well
as a significantly larger amount of water consumption. These predictions
can be reconciled with the macroscopic experimental observation that
products characterized by better mechanical strength and reduced porosity
are formed when sodium silicate is used as activator.

The N–A–S–H phase, which nucleates
immediately after the contact of metakaolin with the alkaline solution,
is chemically affine to natrolite, with Na/Al = 1 and Si/Al = 1.5.
This stoichiometric constraint, and equilibrium of this phase with
the aqueous solution, may explain the experimental observation that
Al aqueous species are more easily detected when no Si is present
in the alkaline activator. Moreover, the presence of excess Na as
a charge-balancing ion may induce enhanced formation of alkaline carbonates
in hydroxide-activated metakaolin.



HydratiCA
relies on classical nucleation theory for simulating the formation
of new phases in solution. One possible improvement in the modeling
of alkali-activated materials may consist in the implementation of
nonclassical nucleation pathways. Recent research suggested that the
formation of new solid phases in the aqueous solution may occur by
the aggregation of prenucleation clusters to form stable nuclei. This
process has been especially observed during the precipitation of amorphous
or defective materials.65,66 Recently, results of
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments have shown that the
nucleation of calcium-silicate hydrates (C–S–H) in Portland
cement occurs by aggregation of prenucleation amorphous entities.67 Similar results were obtained for metal–organic
frameworks topologically affine to zeolites.68 SAXS experiments performed on alkali-activated metakaolin showed
analogous results with the formation of 2 nm clusters, defined as
oligomers by the authors, by the aggregation of smaller particles,69 suggesting an analogy between condensation of
oligomers and nucleation.

One potentially viable numerical approach
for the implementation of nonclassical nucleation pathways in alkali-activated
system is “population balance modeling”. This numerical
scheme can track the time variation in the size distribution of particles
present in a given system, similarly to what can be experimentally
achieved by SAXS methods. Population balance modeling was recently
implemented to the simulation of C–S–H formation by
the aggregation of defective crystallites.70

It is also important to stress that experimental efforts,
oriented at measuring the rate of metakaolin dissolution and N–A–S–H
precipitation, as well as the definition of specific N–A–S–H
thermodynamic models, will be necessary for developing more accurate
numerical models.

The final message of this work is that the
use of kinetic, thermodynamic, and multiscale microstructural models
of alkali-activated systems should be encouraged, as it will certainly
be beneficial to a deeper understanding of the basic chemical aspects
of this class of sustainable binders.
