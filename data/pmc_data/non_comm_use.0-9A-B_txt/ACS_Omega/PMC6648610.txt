Introduction
Siloxanes are an important
class of compounds found in a vast number
of products that enable our modern lifestyles.1 Silanols and siloxanols have broad utility as reagents,2,3 coupling partners,4−6 ligands,7−11 directing groups,12 and hydrogen-bonding
and anion-binding catalysts.13−15 Various methods have been reported
for the direct synthesis of silanols from hydrosilanes using a variety
of transition-metal compounds including Ru, Ir, Cr, and Rh and various
nanoparticles;16−18 however, these metal reagents can be expensive and/or
difficult to access. These methods represent the hydrolysis of the
Si–H bond to a Si–O bond but are still often referred
to as oxidation in analogy to organometallic chemistry and/or the
oxidative reagents employed (Figure 1). Several methods for silane hydrolysis have also
been reported using stoichiometric oxidants such as dioxiranes.19 Recently, an organocatalytic hydrolysis of non-oxygenated
silanes with 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (BzCF3) was reported
by Kokotos and co-workers, which relies on the in situ formation of
a highly active oxidizing species under basic and biphasic conditions.17,20−22 Arzumanyan et al. has investigated the hydrolysis
of primarily alkyl siloxanes; however, a larger investigation of aryl
siloxanes has not been demonstrated.17 Herein,
we present the first examples of organocatalytic and base-catalyzed
methods for conversion of hydrido-siloxanes to the corresponding 1,3-disiloxanediols.

Figure 1 Hydrolysis
methods converting hydrido-siloxanes to siloxanols.

The ability to produce silanols from hydrido-silanes
under “metal-free”
oxidative hydrolysis conditions is of particular interest because
hydrosilanes are easy to handle and pose higher stability toward moisture
compared to silyl chlorides; hydrosilanes produce hydrogen gas upon
hydrolysis as opposed to chlorosilanes, which produce stoichiometric
quantities of hydrochloric acid in their conversion to silanols. Notably,
the production of hydrogen gas as a consequence of silane hydrolysis
has been described to have application as a potential method of hydrogen
storage.23

Our investigation of the
hydrolysis of hydrido-siloxanes began
with a screen of hydrolysis methods for 1,3-dihydro-disiloxanes (Table 1). 1,1-Diisopropyl-3,3-di(naphthalene-1-yl)disiloxane
(1a) was selected as a model compound because 1a contains both aryl and alkyl hydrido-silanes on the siloxane backbone.
First, we evaluated the dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II)
dimer and 1,5-cycloocatadiene-iridium(I) chloride dimer catalysts
(in the presence of water) because they are both known to be highly
active catalysts for the hydrolysis of non-oxygenated hydrosilanes.24,25 Neither transition-metal complex afforded the desired disiloxanediol 2a (Table 1, entries 1 and 2): the ruthenium catalyst resulted in a complex
mixture, and the iridium catalyst resulted in the recovery of the
starting material. In comparison, Pd/C is effective as a catalyst
for the hydrolysis of 1,3-dihydro-disiloxane 1a, affording
disiloxanediol 2a in 82% (Table 1, entry 3).13

d Chemoselective hydrolysis of the
Np2SiH side occurs; partially hydrolyzed siloxanol 3a was observed as the major product.

We then evaluated BzCF3 as an organocatalyst
for the
oxidative hydrolysis of disiloxane 1a.20 Using BzCF3 under basic conditions (pH 11.0)
in the presence of hydrogen peroxide afforded a quantitative yield
of 2a with 10 mol % catalyst loading in 2 h (Table 1, entry 4). With these
results, we lowered the catalyst loadings resulting in a final catalyst
loading of 0.01 mol %, with a reaction time of 4 h (Table 1, entries 5–7). The BzCF3 conditions yielded disiloxanediol 2a as a pure
product that did not require any further purification after workup.
When BzCF3 was omitted from the reaction (Table 1, entry 8), disiloxanediol 2a was not observed. Using basic conditions with peroxide
afforded only the selective hydrolysis of the naphthyl-bearing hydrido-silane
with limited conversion of the alkyl hydrido-silane bond (i.e., affording
siloxanol 3a as the major product).

With an optimized
organocatalytic hydrolysis method, we then explored
the substrate scope using a series of dihydrosiloxanes (Figure 2). Disiloxanediols 2a–2e are obtained in high yield, typically without
further purification required. Notably, 2e was produced
in high yield using the organocatalytic hydrolysis but was not produced
using the other hydrolysis methods in Table 1. For some substrates (e.g., 1d and 1e), formation of ∼5% silanediol is also
observed, corresponding to the cleavage of the disiloxane bond during
activation of the silane. As a control experiment, resubjecting isolated
disiloxanediol 2d to reaction conditions did not yield
any silanediol, suggesting that the formation of the silanediol does
not occur as a result of the hydrolysis of the siloxane bond under
basic conditions. Exposure of phenyl-containing 1f and 1g did not afford any desired disiloxanediol, and a complex
mixture was observed using 1H NMR analysis of the crude
reaction mixture. These data highlight a striking difference in the
ability to access siloxanols bearing phenyl rings versus naphthyl
rings using this organocatalytic method. While it is unsurprising
that the silane bearing the phenyl ring is highly susceptible to Tamao–Fleming
oxidation, the difference in reactivity between phenyl and naphthyl
was more than anticipated. Being able to tame this “overoxidation”
would allow us to access a larger variety of disiloxanediols using
greener methods.

Figure 2 Scope of an organocatalytic method for the synthesis of
1,3-disiloxanediols.

Because a control experiment had indicated that basic conditions
excluding the BzCF3 catalyst still afforded the selective
hydrolysis of the naphthyl hydrido-silane portion of 1a (Table1, entry 8),
we evaluated a base-catalyzed hydrolysis for the conversion of tetra-aryl
1,3-dihydrido-disiloxanes such as 1d to 1,3-disiloxanediol 2d (Table 2).26 We hypothesized that the optimal
selection of base could impart control and limit the Tamao–Fleming
oxidation of C–Si bonds in 1,3-dihydrido-disiloxanes tetra-aryl
disiloxanes.

b 1,1,3,3-tetra(naphthalene-1-yl)disiloxane-1-ol)
is the major product; di(naphthalene-1-yl)silanediol was also observed.

First, the necessity of base
was confirmed. When 1d was subjected to three equivalents
of hydrogen peroxide in the absence
of base, only the starting material was recovered (Table 2, entry 1). Metal hydroxides
generated a complex mixture based on 1H NMR analysis (Table 2, entries 2 and 3),
which is surprising, considering that the ability of these metal hydroxides
to produce silyl ethers and silyl alkynes has been recently reported.27,28 Using an organic base such as triethylamine (TEA) not only afforded
promising results but also afforded silanediol resulting in a lower
yield of 2d (Table 2, entry 4). When sodium carbonate was employed, the
product 2d was not observed. Potassium carbonate generated
the desired 1,3-disiloxanediol 2d, but the corresponding
silanediol was also observed (Table 2, entry 6). Finally, cesium carbonate was investigated,
which afforded the highest selectivity for the synthesis of 1,3-disiloxanediol 2d, with 5 mol % affording the highest yield and cleanest
reaction (Table 2,
entries 7–10).29

Cesium carbonate
was compared as a catalyst for the hydrolysis
of three tetra-aryl 1,3-dihydro-disiloxanes (Figure 3). Catalytic cesium carbonate conditions
generate disiloxanediols 2d and 2e with
high efficiency. The cesium conditions were still not viable for phenyl-containing
substrates; the reaction of 1f in these conditions led
to the traditional Tamao–Fleming oxidation products (i.e.,
phenol).30

Figure 3 Base-mediated hydrolysis of tetra-aryl
1,3-dihydrido-disiloxanes.

These results led us to posit that a chemoselective hydrolysis
of aryl silanes could be performed in the presence of alkyl silanes
(Figure 4). The cesium-catalyzed
hydrolysis of 1a and 1b afforded a mixture
of products with low selectivity; however, using one equivalent of
triethylamine promoted a chemoselective hydrolysis for the hydrosilane
bearing the naphthyl rings to afford siloxanol 3a and 3b. This represents the first report of a chemoselective silane
hydrolysis.

Figure 4 Chemoselective hydrolysis of 1,3-dihydrido-disiloxanes.

Because the Tamao–Fleming oxidation was
observed as a persistent
issue in the synthesis of phenyl-containing siloxanols, we also synthesized
a series of tertiary and secondary silanes to determine what electronic
and steric differences between the phenyl and naphthyl rings would
suppress this oxidation event (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). We determined that the presence of
ortho substitution on at least one aryl ring can suppress the Tamao–Fleming
oxidation pathway; however, this suppressive effect can be diminished
by the presence of electron-withdrawing groups. These data provide
additional mechanistic insight into the “fluoride-free”
Tamao–Fleming oxidation (see the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated the first organocatalytic hydrolysis
of 1,3-dihydrido-disiloxanes to 1,3-disiloxanediols utilizing low
catalyst loadings (0.01 mol %). We also optimized a base-catalyzed
method for the hydrolysis of tetra-aryl disiloxanes using cesium carbonate.
Observations and mechanistic insight into the competing oxidation
and hydrolysis pathways led to the development of the first chemoselective
hydrolysis of unsymmetrical disiloxanes. These results show that the
differential reactivity of aryl and alkyl silanes within 1,3-dihydro-disiloxanes
can be utilized for selective synthesis.
