We report the synthesis and photovoltaic performance
of a new nonstoichiometric
ternary metal sulfide alloyed semiconductor–CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals prepared by the two-stage sequential ionic layer adsorption
reaction technique. The synthesized CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals retain the orthorhombic structure of the host Sb2S3 with Cd substituting a fraction (x = 0–0.15) of the cationic element Sb. The CdxSb2–yS3−δ lattice expands relative to the host, Sb2S3, with its lattice constant a increasing linearly
with Cd content x. Optical and external quantum efficiency
(EQE) spectra revealed that the bandgap Eg of CdxSb2–yS3−δ decreased from 1.99 to 1.69 eV
(i.e., 625–737 nm) as x increased from 0 to
0.15. Liquid-junction CdxSb2–yS3−δ quantum dot-sensitized
solar cells were fabricated using the polyiodide electrolyte. The
best cell yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.72% with
the photovoltaic parameters of Jsc = 15.97
mA/cm2, Voc = 0.50 V, and FF
= 46.6% under 1 sun. The PCE further increased to 4.86%, a respectable
value for a new solar material, under a reduced light intensity of
10% sun. The PCE (4.86%) and Jsc (15.97
mA/cm2) are significantly larger than that (PCE = 1.8%, Jsc = 8.55 mA/cm2) of the Sb2S3 host. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed
that the ZnSe passivation coating increased the electron lifetime
by three times. The EQE spectrum of CdxSb2–yS3−δ has a maximal EQE of 82% at λ = 350 nm and covers the spectral
range of 300–750 nm, which is significantly broader than that
(300–625 nm) of the Sb2S3 host. The EQE-integrated
current density yields a Jph of 11.76
mA/cm2. The tunable bandgap and a respectable PCE near
5% suggest that CdxSb2–yS3−δ could be a potential
candidate for a solar material.

1 Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized
solar cells (QDSSCs) have attracted much
attention as a low-cost alternative to silicon-based and thin-film
photovoltaic devices. A QDSSC adopts the basic architecture of a dye-sensitized
solar cell in which a layer of the nanostructured semiconductor sensitizer
is deposited on a mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode. The utilization
of semiconductor nanoparticles as a sensitizer has the advantages
of a tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and in certain
cases, multiple exciton generation by a single photon.1−3 A good solar absorber material should have a direct or nearly direct
energy gap, large absorption coefficients, and an energy gap Eg near the optimal value of ∼1.2 to 1.4
eV.4 To date, the most widely studied semiconductor
sensitizers for QDSSCs have been the stoichiometric binary metal sulfides
such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe, Sb2S3, and Ag2S.3,5−9 The highest efficiency achieved in single-layered binary QDSSCs
is typically ∼5 to 6%.10−12 Recently, stoichiometric ternary
metal sulfides such as AgSbS2, AgInS2, CuSbS2, CuBiS2, and Pb5Sb8S17 have also been investigated.13−17

A major disadvantage of using stoichiometric
semiconductors, either
binary or ternary, is that the bandgap has a fixed value, which also
fixes the optical absorption range. Hence, there are only a limited
number of semiconductors that have their Eg close to the optimal value of 1.4 eV. To overcome the fixed bandgap
problem, the optical absorption range could be tuned through varying
nanoparticle sizes, doping impurity into the semiconductor, varying
the material composition, or designing heterostructured materials.18 Of these approaches, composition control has
been particularly widely studied to tune semiconductor bandgaps. In
the case of a metal sulfide semiconductor, the composition can be
changed by (1) anion alloying, (2) cationic alloying, and (3) cation–anion
alloying. For example, the Eg of the anionic
alloyed metal sulfide CdSxSe1–x can be tuned from ∼400 to 550 nm by controlling
the S anion content x from 0 to 1.19,20 The Eg of the cationic alloyed metal
sulfide ZnxCd1–xS is tunable from 474 to 391 nm by varying the contents of
Cd and Zn.21 The Eg of the cationic alloyed semiconductor Cu–In–S
is tunable from 1.48 to 2.30 eV by controlling the Cu composition.22 A notable result is that many high-performance
ternary alloyed QDSSCs were discovered in semiconductors with nonstoichiometric
elemental composition (i.e., x being not an integer).

In addition to absorption, charge collection is important. For
this aspect, a high dielectric constant is favorable. This has been
noted in both halide and nonhalide semiconductors, including perovskite
halides and various chalcogenides.23−25 In this regard, CH3NH3PbI3, which is among the most promising
solar absorber materials, has a dielectric constant of approximately
70. This motivates the investigation of other high dielectric constant
materials, including Sb2S3. However, while Sb2S3 is a very high dielectric constant semiconductor,
near ferroelectricity, its bandgap is too large to be an effective
solar absorber. The direction averaged dielectric constant of Sb2S3 is 70, similar to CH3NH3PbI3, although unlike the perovskite it is significantly
anisotropic.26 Here, we report partial
replacement of Sb by Cd that reduces the bandgap along with properties
in the context of QDSSC application.

Among the binary metal
sulfides, the divalent CdS has been the
most investigated system due in part to the ease of material growth.
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CdS QDSSCs, however, is relatively
low (typically ∼1.5%) because of its large Eg (∼2.5 eV) and a small absorption range (∼300
to 500 nm).27 Trivalent Sb2S3 is a more attractive solar material. Sb2S3 has a bulk bandgap of Eg = 1.9
eV,23 which is, however, larger than the
optimal Eg of 1.4 eV. It has a large absorption
coefficient α of ∼5 × 104 cm–1 at λ = 600 nm,28 and as mentioned
is a high dielectric constant semiconductor. These features make Sb2S3 a potential solar material. Moreover, Sb2S3 contains two elements that are earth-abundant,
nontoxic, and of low cost. Sb2S3 has been one
of the best binary sensitizer for QDSSCs, achieving a PCE of 5% in
solid-state Sb2S3 QDSSCs using the spiro-OMeTaD
electrolyte.29 However, the performance
in liquid-junction Sb2S3 QDSSCs is significantly
lower, achieving a PCE of only 1.80% with a short-circuit current
density Jsc of 8.55 mA/cm2.30 In principle, it should be possible to form
ternary Cd–Sb–S compounds through the combination of
CdS and Sb2S3. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there has been no report on the synthesis or photovoltaics of ternary
Cd–Sb–S compounds. Here, we report CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals. These were synthesized by alloying two binary semiconductors
CdS and Sb2S3 using the sequential ionic layer
adsorption reaction (SILAR) process. Liquid-junction QDSSCs, the structure
depicted in Figure 1, were fabricated from the synthesized ternary nanocrystals. The
dependences of photovoltaic performance of the solar cells on the
SILAR cycles, passivation coating, and sun light intensity are reported.
The variation of the bandgap with Cd content is investigated from
the optical and quantum efficiency spectra. The results reveal that
the incorporation of Cd into the host Sb2S3 leads
to a decrease in Eg, a broader optical
absorption band, and a significantly improved photovoltaic performance
over that of the host Sb2S3.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 EDS Spectroscopy
The Cd content x in the alloyed CdxSb2–yS3−δ is expected to vary
with the number of SILAR cycles n. Therefore, it
is important first to determine the Cd content for each SILAR condition. Figure 2a displays the X-ray
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals prepared with CdS SILAR cycles n =
5 (the number of Sb–S SILAR cycles was fixed at 5). The rest
EDS spectra for n = 0, 2, 3 and 4 are displayed in
Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Table 1 lists the EDS data
for the Cd, Sb, S atomic percentages for five CdxSb2–yS3−δ samples. The Cd content increased from x = 0.08
to 0.15 as the number of CdS SILAR cycles increased from 2 to 5. For
example, the chemical formula for the sample with 5 CdS SILAR cycles
is Cd0.15Sb1.85S3. The result clearly
shows the successful incorporation of Cd2+ ions into the
host Sb2S3 lattice. Approximately 7.7% of Sb
atoms have been substituted by Cd atoms for the sample with 5 CdS
SILAR cycles.

A second notable feature of the EDS result is the
variations of
S atomic percentage with SILAR cycles n. For the
two samples with a low number of CdS SILAR cycles (Sb2S3 and Cd0.08Sb1.92S3), the
S percentage is close to 60%, which is consistent with the elemental
ratio of 2:3 in the host material Sb2S3. As
the number of CdS SILAR cycles increased from 2 to 5, the S percentage
decreased from 59.5 to 43.5%. The decrease in S percentage indicates
some S lattice sites are vacant in the ternary CdxSb2–yS3 compound.
Hence, the chemical formulae should be expressed as CdxSb2–yS3−δ where δ is the deficiency in the S atom. A possible cause
of the deficiency in the S element is the ionic radii in the ternary
semiconductor: Cd2+ (95 pm), Sb3+ (76 pm), and
S2– (184 pm). S has the largest ionic radius among
the three elements. This would make S the element most difficult to
enter the lattice during the SILAR deposition process. The deficiency
became more pronounced with the increasing number of SILAR cycles,
as revealed in Table 1.

2.2 X-ray Diffraction
Figure 2b shows the XRD patterns of
CdxSb2–yS3−δ-alloyed nanocrystals prepared with various
numbers of SILAR cycles, n. Their chemical formulae
are labeled in the figure. For comparison, the XRD pattern of the
host semiconductor Sb2S3 is also shown at the
bottom panel (JCPDS 01-075-1310). An enlarged figure containing three
pronounced (hkl) planes (121), (221), and (301) (angles
between 27 and 35°) is shown in Figure 2c. The ternary CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals retain the orthorhombic structure of the Sb2S3 host. This implies that the Cd atoms enter the host
Sb2S3 lattice at least primarily as a substitutional
element, replacing a fraction of the cationic Sb atoms. The second
notable feature is that the XRD peaks shift to lower angles with increasing
Cd composition x. Table S1 (Supporting Information) lists the XRD angles versus x of CdxSb2–yS3−δ. The lower angle indicates an
expansion in the lattice. This can be explained partly in terms of
the ionic radius: Cd2+ (95 pm) and Sb3+ (76
pm). The significantly larger Cd2+ ionic radius relative
to Sb3+ results in an expansion in the host Sb2S3 lattice. The calculated lattice constants a, b, and c as a function of x are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Figure 2d,e displays the lattice constants a and b as a function of Cd content x. The lattice
constant a increases linearly with x. On the contrary, the lattice constant b decreases
linearly with x. The lattice constants c, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), also increases with x, but the increase is important
only at high Cd contents (x > 0.12). The dependence
of lattice constant a and b on x can be expressed, respectively, as 1   2  

The smooth variation of the lattice
parameter with Cd content confirms Cd incorporation into the Sb2S3 host.

2.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Figure 3a displays
a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a bare TiO2 film. The TiO2 particles are rectangular in shape with
round corners, with a length ≈ 30 nm and an aspect ratio of
2:1. Figure 3b shows
a TEM image of CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals deposited
over TiO2 particles. CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals
can be seen to be distributed randomly over the TiO2 surface
without apparent aggregation. The CdxSb2–yS3−δ particles
are roughly spherical in shape with sizes in the range of 7–17
nm and an average diameter of 11 nm. Figure 3c displays a TEM selective area electron
diffraction image of CdxSb2–yS3−δ particles. The diffraction
pattern, as the labeled (hkl) planes indicate, can
be assigned to the orthorhombic structure of the host Sb2S3. The result is consistent with the XRD result shown
in Figure 2, providing
further support of successful Cd incorporation into Sb2S3.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis has been performed
to further verify the chemical composition, material purity, and surface
valence states of the elements in CdxSb2–yS3−δ. As
shown in Figure 4a,
the survey spectrum of the CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystal shows the
pronounced featured signals of Cd 3d, Sb 3d, S 2p, Ti 2p, and O 1s,
indicating that CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals are homogenously
distributed on the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode.
No obvious impurities are observed in the spectrum. The binding energies
of 405.5 and 412.2 eV for Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, separated by 6.7 eV, confirm the bivalent oxidation state for Cd
(see Figure 4b).32,33 The XPS spectrum of antimony, as shown in Figure 4c, shows two peaks at the binding energy
of 529.5 eV for Sb 3d5/2 and 538.2 eV for Sb 3d3/2 (separated by 8.7 eV), confirming the presence of the trivalent
antimony Sb3+ state in the CdxSb2–yS3 phase.34 Two weak peaks at the higher energies of 539.2
and 539.5 eV were due to the oxidized Sb–O, which was possibly
formed on the surface of CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals prior to
the XPS measurement.35 In the deconvoluted
spectrum of S 2p (Figure 4d), the binding energies at 160.6 and 161.6 eV correspond
to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, with a
small difference of 1 eV. It indicates the presence of divalent S2– ions in the CdxSb2–yS3−δ phase.
Therefore, the XPS analysis demonstrates the existence of CdxSb2–yS3−δ bonds in the as-prepared nanocrystals and is consistent with the
findings from the XRD and EDS studies.

2.5 Optical Spectra
Figure 5 shows the optical spectra
for CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals with various numbers
of CdS SILAR cycles n (Sb2S3 SILAR cycles fixed at 5). The Cd content x is labeled
in the figure. Increasing the CdS SILAR cycles n has
two effects on CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals (1) an
increase in the particle size and (2) an increase in Cd content x. The transmission spectra T(λ)
were measured by taking the ratio of ICdxSb2–yS3−δ/ITiO2, where ICdxSb2–yS3−δ is the light intensity transmitted through a Cd–Sb–S
film coated on a TiO2 electrode, and ITiO2 is the light intensity transmitted through
a bare TiO2 film. Thus, T(λ) represents
the transmission solely because of the Cd–Sb–S nanoparticles.
The transmission spectra T(λ) in Figure 5a indicate that T(λ) decreases with increasing n, that is,
increased light absorption for large n. Figure 5b shows the absorbance A(λ) = −log10T(λ). A(λ) increases with the number
of SILAR cycles and Cd content. The increased light absorption with n can be attributed to the increasing amount of the CdxSb2–yS3−δ material deposited on the photoanode. Figure 5c displays the Tauc
plots (αhν)2 versus hν. The intercept to the x-axis yields
the optical bandgap Eg. As seen in the
figure, Eg decreases with n, yielding Eg = 2.03 (n = 0), 1.94 (n = 2), 1.81 (n =
3), 1.76 (n = 4), and 1.65 (n =
5) eV. Table 2 lists
the dependence of optical Eg on Cd content x. The low-energy part of the Tauc plots exhibits an arched
shape, which is identified as the Urbach tail that arises from defects
in the sample. The Urbach tail results in uncertainty in extrapolating
the linear region of a Tauc plot. Hence, the Eg deduced from the Tauc plots should be considered as an approximate
value. Nevertheless, the Eg data displayed
in Figure 5 clearly
show the qualitative trend that Eg lowers
with increasing Cd content x. The dependence of Eg on x is shown in Figure 5d. The lowering of Eg with increasing SILAR n could
be attributed to three effects (1) quantum size effect, (2) Cd alloying
induced effect, and (3) band tail states. First, consider the quantum
size effect. Because the XRD data indicated that CdxSb2–yS3−δ crystals have the same lattice structure of the host Sb2S3, the Bohr radius of CdxSb2–yS3−δ should be close to that of Sb2S3, which is
only 0.9 nm, as reported in the literature.36 As shown in the TEM images, the CdxSb2–yS3−δ crystals
have sizes near ∼11 nm, much larger than the Bohr radius. Thus,
the quantum size effect in CdxSb2–yS3−δ crystals should be weak
and probably not important. The second effect is explained in terms
of Cd alloying into the Sb2S3 host resulting
in a lower Eg. The third possible explanation
for Eg lowering is the band tail states
formed during the SILAR process, proposed by Rabinovich and Hodes.37 This effect is more important for very thick
films (i.e., high SILAR cycles n). The thickness
of samples studied in this work is probably too thin to have this
band tail states. However, the issue of the band tail states is beyond
the scope of this paper. We will return to the discussion on Eg in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) section.

2.6 Photovoltaic Performance
The photovoltaic
performance of a SILAR-prepared QDSSC is sensitive to the number of
SILAR cycles n because there is an optimal loading
of the QD material deposited on the mp-TiO2 electrode.
An insufficient or excess amount of QDs both leads to reduced performance.
First, we needed to find out the optimal SILAR cycles for the host
Sb2S3 QDSSCs. The optimal Sb2S3 SILAR cycles, revealed by I–V measurements, was determined to be 5. The Cd element was
then gradually incorporated into the optimal Sb2S3 by increasing the CdS SILAR cycles. Figure 6a shows the I–V curves of several CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSCs
with various SILAR cycles and Cd content x. Table 3 lists their associated
parameters: short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, fill factor
FF, and PCE. The PCE of the host Sb2S3 QDSSC
(sample no. 1) was 1.00%. The Cd-incorporated sample with low SILAR
cycles n = 2 (no. 2) yielded a PCE of 1.63%. The
performance increased monotonically with increasing SILAR cycles and
reached a maximal value of 2.62% at n = 5 (no. 5).
For n = 6 (no. 8), the PCE decreased to 2.08%. The
best sample yielded a Jsc of 14.58 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.43 V, a FF of 41.70%,
and a PCE of 2.62%. The improved performance with increasing SILAR
cycles can be attributed to two factors (1) an increase in the amount
of the QD material deposited on the electrode and (2) an increase
in the optical absorption bandwidth with increasing Cd content x. In a SILAR process, the amount of the material deposited
on a TiO2 electrode increases with SILAR cycles. This will
produce increased light absorption, leading to a higher PCE. After
reaching the optimal cycles, further SILAR cycles would overload the
mesoporous TiO2 electrode, which will block the porous
spaces within the TiO2 electrode and hamper proper flow
of the liquid electrolyte, leading to a lower PCE. Meanwhile, the
increase in CdS SILAR cycles increases the Cd content x. This will result in a lower Eg as seen
in the optical data above. A lower Eg produces
a broader absorption band and yields enhanced light absorption.

After finding the optimal number of SILAR cycles,
the best sample
(no. 5) was further treated with a ZnS or ZnSe passivation coating
in order to reduce carrier recombination. Figure 6b compares the photovoltaic performance before
and after passivation. A ZnS coating increased the PCE from 2.62 to
3.58% (no. 6), a significant increase of 37%. When ZnS was replaced
by ZnSe (no. 7), the PCE further increased to 3.72% with photovoltaic
parameters of Jsc = 15.97 mA, Voc = 0.50 V, and FF = 46.6%. Nanocrystals synthesized
by SILAR inherently contains a large number of surface defects acting
as recombination centers for photogenerated electron–hole (e–h)
pairs. A layer of ZnS coating forms a potential barrier and reduces
e–h recombination. The large improvement in PCE after passivation
indicates that carrier recombination is an active, important process
in the CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals. ZnSe is a better
passivation material than ZnS because of its better alignment of energy
levels, as reported previously.38

Quantum efficiency is an important parameter for a solar material. Figure 6c shows the EQE spectra
of CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSCs with various Cd content x. The cells with increasing x exhibit
three characteristics (1) improved EQE performance, (2) a broader
EQE spectral range, and (3) an EQE onset at a longer wavelength. The
results indicate that the photovoltaic performance improves with increasing
Cd content. The EQE spectral range of CdxSb2–yS3−δ (x = 0.15) is 300–750 nm, whereas the range
for the host Sb2S3 is 300–625 nm. The
range of the ternary CdxSb2–yS3−δ is thus significantly
broader than that of Sb2S3. The effects of ZnS/ZnSe
passivation coatings were also investigated using EQE measurements. Figure 6d shows the EQE spectra
of the best x = 0.15 cell before and after passivation.
The EQE spectra exhibit clear improvement after passivation. The maximal
EQE value of the untreated sample is 75%. It increases to 82% at λ
= 350 nm after ZnSe treatment. This EQE value is near the maximal
EQE achievable for this solar cell [there being a ≈15% losses
in incident sun intensity because of the optical absorption and reflections
by the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, hence, theoretical maximal
EQE ≈ 85%].

The total photocurrent Jph generated
by a solar cell can be calculated from the EQE spectrum using the
equation 3  where e is the elementary
charge and Φ(λ) is the incident photon flux. The integrated Jph for various samples is displayed on the right
axis of Figure 6d,e
and listed in the right column of Table 3. Jph increases
with increasing Cd content x and reaches the maximal
value of 11.76 mA/cm2 for the best ZnSe-treated cell (no.
7).

The photovoltaic performance of a QDSSC could be improved
by measuring
the I–V curves under reduced
light intensities. The effect is especially important for QDSSCs prepared
by the SILAR method. Figure 7a displays the I–V curves of the best CdxSb2–yS3−δ cell under various reduced
sun intensities. Table 4 lists their photovoltaic parameters. The PCE increased from 3.72%
(1 sun) to 4.86% (0.1 sun), a significant enhancement of 30%. The
PCE of 4.86% represents the maximal PCE that can be achieved in the
CdxSb2–yS3−δ cell. The improved PCE is mainly due
to the improved FF, which increased from 46.6% (1 sun) to 60.2% (0.1
sun). The increased FF is attributed to the reduction in carrier recombination
under low light intensities. Electron–hole recombination can
occur at the interfaces of the TiO2/electrolyte and QD/electrolyte.
A possible e–h recombination mechanism is through multiple
traps at the QD surface.39,40 The multiple traps
theory predicts a sublinear Jsc versus I0 relation: Jsc = I0α, with α < 1, where I0 is the light intensity. Analysis of the Jsc – I0 data
in Table 3 reveals
that α = 0.91. This is in agreement with the multiple trap theory.
According to the theory, the number of photogenerated carrier nph decreases as the incident light intensity I0 decreases. As nph decreases, the e–h recombination process also decreases,
but with a faster rate than the decreasing nph. The decreased recombination rate increases Jsc and FF, leading to an enhanced PCE. We will discuss
more on the recombination issue in Section 2.7 on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS). Finally, the present CdxSb2–yS3−δ results
are compared with the results of Sb2S3 solar
cells. The best liquid-junction Sb2S3 QDSSC
achieved a PCE = 1.8% and Jsc = 8.55 mA/cm2, as reported in a recent paper.30 The CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSC (4.86%, 15.97 mA/cm2) is clearly significantly improved over Sb2S3 reported to date.

Figure 7 (a) I–V curves of the
best CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSC (x = 0.15)
under various reduced light intensities and (b) EQE-deduced Eg for CdxSb2–yS3−δ samples
with various Cd content x.

Table 4 Photovoltaic Parameters under Various
Reduced Light Intensities
sun intensity	Jsc (mA/cm2)	Voc (V)	FF (%)	PCE (%)	
100% sun	15.97	0.50	46.6	3.72	
50% sun	8.04	0.45	56.0	4.05	
10% sun	1.92	0.42	60.2	4.86	
At low light intensities, Voc decreased
from 0.50 to 0.42 V as the light intensity decreased from 1 to 0.1
sun, a trend opposite to that of the PCE. This result is also related
to the reduction in photocarrier density nph. The theoretical upper limit for Voc = EF – Eredox, where EF is the quasi Fermi
level of TiO2 and Eredox is
the redox level of the liquid electrolyte. EF depends on carrier density nCB in the TiO2 conduction band according to EF = kT·ln(nCB).41 A reduced light generates
a smaller carrier density nCB and, hence,
a lower EF. Accordingly, Voc decreases at low light intensities.

The onset
of an EQE spectrum represents the energy where the valence
band to the conduction band transition occurs, that is, energy gap Eg. Thus, an EQE spectrum provides an alternative
way to determine Eg. Figure 7b shows the enlarged EQE spectra
near the onsets of the five samples. Here, Eg was estimated by extrapolating the EQE curve to the x-axis, shown as dashed lines in the figure. The EQE-extrapolated Eg as a function of x is listed
in Table 2 and plotted
in Figure 4d. The Eg resulting from the EQE method is consistent
with that of the optical result. The figure shows that Eg decreases from 1.99 to 1.69 eV as x increases from 0 to 0.15. The dependence of Eg on x was further analyzed using Vegard’s
law  where b = 3.44 is a fitting
parameter. In the fitting the Eg values
of CdS and Sb2S3 nanoparticles were set to be
2.42 and 2.03 eV, respectively. The fitted results, shown as the red
dots in Figure 4d and
listed in Table 2,
are in good agreement with the optical- and EQE-derived Eg.

2.7 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
The effect of ZnS or ZnSe passivation coatings on the electron transport
and recombination of the best x = 0.15 QDSSC was
studied using EIS. Figure 8a shows the Nyquist plots before and after passivation. The
curves were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset,
where Rs is the series resistance and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. The first
high-frequency semicircle is related to Rs that corresponds to the electron transfer resistance between the
counter electrode and electrolyte. The second intermediate frequency
semicircle is related to Rct that corresponds
to the charge transfer resistance between QDs and electrolyte. Table 5 lists the fitting
results of Rs, Rct, and electron lifetime τn. The series resistance Rs value is around 24 Ω and remains roughly
the same after passivation. In contrast, the charge transfer resistance Rct increases from 119 Ω (no passivation)
to 267.4 Ω (ZnS) to 345 Ω (ZnSe passivation), a significant
increase of ≈200% after passivation. The higher Rct implies that the electrons in a QD would be more difficult
to recombine with holes in the electrolyte, resulting in improved
photovoltaic performance. The electron lifetime τn can be deduced by analyzing the frequency-phase relation. Figure 8b displays the Bode
plots of the cells after passivation. The peak frequency ωmax is correlated with the electron recombination rate. The
electron lifetime τn can be calculated from ωmax using 4  τn increases from 0.07 ms
(before passivation) to 0.20 ms (after ZnSe passivation). The increased
electron lifetime τn indicates a reduced e–h
recombination rate ωmax, allowing electrons to travel
a longer distance and facilitating charge collection at electrodes.
The EIS analysis confirms the positive effect of ZnS and ZnSe passivation
treatments on the performance of x = 0.15 CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSCs.

3 Conclusions
Ternary Cd0.15Sb1.85S3 nanocrystals
were synthesized onto an mp-TiO2 electrode by alloying
of two binary semiconductors CdS and PbS. The Eg decreased with increasing Cd content. The CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSCs near x = 0.15 achieved a near 5% PCE and
an EQE Jph ≈ 23 mA/cm2. The optical absorption range is tunable from 300 to 750 nm by controlling
the Cd composition. The tunable bandgap and a respectable PCE lend
weight to the idea of using high dielectric constant semiconductors
for solar absorbers and suggest the potential of CdxSb2–yS3−δ as a solar material.

4 Experimental Section
The major components
of a CdxSb2–yS3−δ QDSSC,
as shown in Figure 1, included an FTO glass substrate, a TiO2 blocking layer,
a mesoporous TiO2 QD sensitizer active layer, an electrolyte,
and a counter electrode. The preparation procedure of each component
is described below.

4.1 Preparation of a TiO2 Photoelectrode
The TiO2 electrode comprised a three-layer structure:
a TiO2 blocking layer (∼80 nm thick), a mesoporous
TiO2 active layer (mp-TiO2, ∼12 μm
thick), and a TiO2 scattering layer (∼3 μm
thick, particle size ≈400 nm). The blocking layer was prepared
by spin-coating a titanium(IV) isoproproxide (TTIP) solution (75 μL
TTIP, 425 μL of 95% ethanol and 500 μL of 0.04 M HCl)
onto a precleaned FTO glass substrate (7 Ω/square, Pilkington),
followed by heating in air at 190 °C for 5 min. Afterward, the
mp-TiO2 active layer was prepared by the doctor-blading
transparent anatase TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NR-T, particle
size ≈ 30 nm) onto an FTO substrate, heating in air at 125
°C for 5 min, then let it cool down to room temperature. Finally,
the scattering layer was coated by doctor-blading on top of the mp-TiO2 active layer (Dyesol WER2-O), then annealed in air at 500
°C for 15 min.

4.2 Synthesis of CdxSb2–yS3−δ Nanocrystals
CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals were prepared
by a two-stage SILAR process. In the first stage, CdS nanocrystals
were grown on a mp-TiO2 electrode. In the second stage,
Sb2S3 nanocrystals were grown on top of the
CdS layer. Post annealing transformed the CdS/Sb2S3 double-layer structure into the CdxSb2–yS3−δ phase. The detail of each step is described below.

A CdS SILAR
cycle consisted of immersing a precleaned mp-TiO2 electrode
into a 0.1 M, 25 °C Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution
for 2 min, followed by rinsing with ethanol and dried in air. This
process produced Cd2+ ions adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 particles. The electrode was subsequently immersed into a
0.1 M, 25 °C Na2S·9H2O methanol solution
for 2 min, followed by rinsing and drying as above. This process produced
S2– ions on the mp-TiO2 electrode. These
two steps formed one CdS SILAR cycle. The process was repeated for
several cycles to increase the amount of the deposited CdS material.
Next, a Sb2S3 SILAR cycle was performed by immersing
the CdS-coated TiO2 electrode into a 0.1 M, 25 °C
Sb2Cl3 ethanol solution for 30 s, followed by
rinsing and drying as above. The electrode was subsequently immersed
into 0.1 M, 25 °C Na2S·9H2O methanol
solution for 1 min. Finally, the CdS/Sb2S3 double-layer
structure was annealed in a N2 gas-flowing tube furnace
at 350 °C for 30 min. CdxSb2–yS3−δ nanocrystals were formed
after annealing.

4.3 Solar Cell Assembly
Solar cells were
fabricated by assembling the CdxSb2–yS3−δ-coated
photoanode with a Pt counter electrode into a sandwich configuration
using a ∼190 μm thick Parafilm as the spacer. A polyiodide
solution, consisting of 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine,
0.6 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.03 M I2, and 0.3 M LiI, was used as the liquid electrolyte. Most (not all)
semiconductor particles dissolve in polyiodide. However, polyiodide
electrolytes can produce a higher Voc than
that of polysulfides because a polyiodide has a redox level lower
than that of a polysulfide.31 We have taken
extreme caution to make sure that the CdxSb2–yS3−δ particles do not dissolve in polyiodide after a period of several
hours.

4.4 Material Characterization and Photovoltaic
Measurements
TEM images were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2010
scanning Image Observation microscope operating at 200 kV. XRD was
measured using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MRD diffractometer.
EDS was measured using a JEOL JSM-7800F Prime Schottky field emission
scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV. Optical absorption
spectra were recorded using a Hitachi 2800A spectrophotometer. EIS
was measured using a Solartron SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer.
Current–voltage (I–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a
150 W Oriel Xe lamp coupled with an Oriel AM 1.5 simulating filter
under 100 mW/cm2 light intensity. A metal mask placed above
the solar cell defined the active area to be 3 mm × 3 mm. The
incident sun intensity was varied from 1 to 0.1 sun by inserting metal
meshes in the light path. EQE spectra were measured using an Acton
monochromator with a 250 W tungsten–halogen lamp (without white
light biasing).
