By making aligned and suspended copper nanowires, a high
performance,
transferable, and flexible transparent electrode is reported. Indium
tin oxide is often used in devices such as displays, solar cells,
and touchscreens that require transparent and conductive plates. Because
of problems such as brittleness, high cost, and environmental effects,
this material is facing rivals, the most serious of which are metallic
nanowire meshes, especially copper. We developed a simple technique
which uses a U-shaped collector in the electrospinning process with
three advantages including the enhancement of the figure of merit
(which is related to the surface resistance Rs and the transmittance T) by about five times
(about T = 90% and Rs = 5 Ω/□, respectively), solving the transfer problem
of the nanowire metal mesh after production, and producing aligned
metal nanowires for special applications. In this work, T and Rs of aligned copper nanowires were
both measured and calculated, which are consistent with each other,
and also, the mentioned results were compared with the work of others.

1 Introduction
The significant increase
in demand from optoelectronic devices
such as displays, solar cells, and touchscreens has stimulated the
development of transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) as an essential
part of these devices. Given the growing the use of smartphones, tablets,
laptops, liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diodes, and
other optoelectronic apparatus, the global TCE market has reached
$7.1 billion in 2018.1,2 Today, indium tin oxide (ITO)
is most commercially used to produce TCEs between various metal oxides.2 The reasons for the popularity of ITO are low
sheet resistance (Rs = 10–100 Ω/□)
at high transparency (T > 85%), which led to the
creation of a $ 5.1 billion market in 2017.2,3 However,
ITO suffers from several limitations, including its high cost, scarcity
of indium, adverse environmental effects, high-temperature fabrication,
and ionic diffusion into organic displays and brittleness, which makes
it unsuitable for future mechanically flexible devices.2,4−7 Thus, considering the fragility characteristics of ITO, alternative
materials should be used to produce flexible transparent electrodes.8

Flexible TCEs have attracted particular
attention in recent years
to fabricate bendable or foldable displays, flexible solar cells,
electronic papers, wearable devices, skin displays, and soft lightings.2,9 Therefore, the development of flexible electrode technology is necessary
to overcome the defects of ITO-based TCEs. Heretofore, researchers
have introduced various materials such as oxide semiconductors, conductive
polymers,10−12 and nanostructure layers3 for the production of these TCEs. Today, nanotechnology creates
much hope for the development of the highly flexible TCEs with superb
conductivity and transparency. Among the nanostructured transparent
electrodes such as carbon nanotubes,13−16 carbon nanobuds,17−20 graphene,21−28 hybrid structures,16,17,23,29−33 and metal nanowire meshes,34−39 the last one due to having suitable features such as high electrical
conductivity, low-cost materials, and excellent mechanical properties
can be considered as a promising candidate for the production of flexible
TCEs.1,40 However, extensive junction resistance due
to the percolation of charges through junctions between different
nanowires leads to drop the electrical conductivity of nanowire-based
TCEs, which in some cases require thermal processes to reduce the
electrical resistance of the junctions that may raise prices of the
finished product.41−43 Also, an appropriate volume of metal nanowires must
be deposited to reach the percolation threshold for achieving high
conductivity and maintain good transparency. Basically, in the multistep
fabrication method, a metal mesh is constructed on the primary substrate
and then transmitted to the final substrate, which in turn causes
the failure of some of the metal wires and reduces the efficiency.
Also, during the sputtering process to metalize polymeric meshes,
owing to the formation of separate islands on the substrate, which
unlikely has an electrical junction with each other, the transparency
reduces sharply. It eliminates the possibility of using the primary
substrate in the final product.

Herein, using a particular collector
in the electrospinning process,
align and hovering polymeric wires were made as a template, and then,
the copper metal was deposited on the produced template by a sputtering
method. Finally, prepared nanowires were transmitted on the high flexible
substrate to achieve the aligned U-shaped copper nanowires for creating
roll-folding TCEs. Although copper has less electrical conductivity
than silver and can be oxidized in air, because of its low cost and
availability, it is still a better option than silver and gold, and
the challenge of oxidizing it can be overcome with protective coatings.44−46 The synthesis of these aligned U-shaped nanowires due to the decrease
in the number of nanowires junction and the consequent reduction of
their electrical resistance results in the production of highly flexible
TCEs with remarkable properties. In this way, the challenges of nanowires
transition on the substrate and unplugged metal islands were solved.
Production of nanowires with this method is less costly than other
methods such as lithography and solution-based and the only sputtering
process in this way has a considerable cost. Today, the sputtering
process is commercially used to produce low-emission glass and ITO
transparent electrode that reduces its cost.

According to the
high impact of the geometric properties of the
metal mesh, such as the thickness of the U-shaped nanowires, the width
of the wires and their density on the transparency and conductivity
of the TCE, a set of experiments was designed and implemented to achieve
the optimal geometric structure. Each of the experiments was studied
in terms of transparency, electrical conductivity, geometric construction,
and performance index. Besides, the wave optic simulations were performed,
and after validation, they were used for studies and physical analyses
of more samples.

2 Methods
The fabrication of aligned
metal nanowires was done in three main
steps (Figure 1a),
initially, (i) the fabrication of the polymeric template with electrospinning,
(ii) metal sputtering on the template, and (iii) the transferring
of nanowires. Polymer fibers were formed using the electrospinning
instrument (ES1-Nanoazma Inc.) by selecting PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)
and PEO (polyethylene oxide) polymers, making concentrations from
5 to 10% and a dc field 1.2 kV/cm. The tip-collector distance was
adjusted at 12 cm with a flow rate of 2 mL/h. The nanofibers were
collected on a U-shaped aluminum substrate with a length of 7 cm,
a height of 2 cm, and a width of 1 cm to achieve aligned nanofibers.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
of the aligned copper nanowires process for fabricating
transparent electrodes. The polymer nanofiber template was first made
by electrospinning and then coated with copper using the sputtering
method. The coated wires were transferred onto a final substrate.
(b) SEM image of obtained aligned wires with a new collector. (c)

polymer and turning upside down from closer view with the usual collector
for comparison. Random U-shaped nanowires are recognizable. (d) Schematic
problems in the usual collector. During the layer deposition process,
the remainder component between wires leads to reduced transparency
and efficiency. Also, during the transfer to another substrate, the
wires would break. The suspended wires described in this work make
the transfer very easy. (e) Definition of the optical 3D model with
its directions and abbreviations. Pitch, thickness, and width of the
nanowires in the mesh were considered to find which geometric structure
is better. The shown waveform has parallel polarization with aligned
wires.

To start electrospinning, a conductive U-shaped
collector was used
so that its electrostatic interaction with charged nanofibers aligns
with collected fibers47 (Figure 1b). The metal deposition process
was carried out with a three-cathode sputtering machine (Nanostructured
Coatings Inc.), a 99.99% copper target, a primary pressure of 10–5 Torr, a working pressure of 10–2 Torr, and an RF field of 120 W with a deposition rate of 15 nm/s.

In conventional methods, the wires are collected on a solid substrate
randomly. Then, in the metal deposition process, the remainder islands
on the substrate between wires lead to reduced transparency and efficiency
(Figure 1d). Also,
during the transfer to another substrate, the wires would break. However,
fabricating of suspended wires in this work makes the transfer easy.
By placing the substrate underneath and moving upward, the nanofibers
are easily transferred to the substrate. Figure 1a step (iii) shows the copper nanowire mesh
after removal of the polymer and turning it upside down.

To
investigate the geometric structure of metal wires and determination
of the optimal structure from the aspect of transparency and conductivity,
the samples with more than 30 geometries were produced in different
widths, thicknesses, and pitches. Afterward, the surface resistance
of the samples was measured using a 4-point-probe instrument (P100
Safir Soraya Inc.) and transparency of the specimens with an UV–vis
instrument (Lambda950 PerkinElmer Inc.). Optical wave simulation performed
based on Maxwell equations with the “Optiwave” software48 by using the FDTD (finite-difference time-domain)
method and the Drude–Lorentz material model. This model is
used for obtaining optical coefficients that coincide with the experimental
results of Rakić data49 for copper.
For the surfaces normal to the incident beam radiation, the perfectly
matched layer boundary condition and for the side surfaces, the periodic
boundary condition has been used. The incident wave is Gaussian type,
the angle of incident is perpendicular to the metallic mesh, its power
is 0.01 W, and its polarization angle is 0 and 90° to nanowire
direction. Geometric simulation models were obtained by changing three
parameters of thickness t, width w, and pitch p (Figure 1e).

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
aligned copper wires in production steps: electrospinning step (Figure 2a,b), after the sputtering
step (Figure 2c), and
after transferring it to the glass substrate (Figure 2d). Also, the wires are transferred to the
flexible layer and are used as a transparent electrode in the circuit
(Figure 2e).

mesh in production steps (a) during electrospinning,
(b) after electrospinning, and (c) after sputtering. (d) Transfer
of wires to the solid substrate and (e) transfer of wires to the flexible
layer and their use as a transparent electrode in the circuit.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
six samples of
aligned metal wires are shown in two widths and three densities (1/pitch)
in Figure 3a–f.
In these images, the almost alignment and the preferred direction
of the wires due to the electrostatic field between the nozzle and
U-shaped collectors are observable. By increasing the density of wires
and aggregation charge on the previous wire, the electric field around
the collector changes and the alignment decreases.

Figure 3 SEM images of six Cu
aligned meshes at two width and three pitches
in 5000× magnification. (a–c) are wider than (d–f)
and the pitch increases from (a,d) to (b,e) and (c,f), respectively.

After transferring metal nanowires to the substrate,
surface resistance
and transparency are measured with 4PP and UV–vis instruments.
The results will be discussed later. Also, the optical simulation
results for both E field and intensity are shown in Figure 4 when the linear polarized
light is incident on a 1D mesh perpendicularly, and the polarization
direction is normal (Figure 4a) or parallel to the wires (Figure 4b). These calculations are performed for
different thicknesses at wavelengths from 0.3 to 1 μm to obtain
the transmittance in each case (Figure 4c). The TC is also obtained from the simulation results.
In the case of polarization parallel to nanowires, the aligned nanowire
metal mesh absorbs more light because of current density along the
wires, while in the case of normal polarization, the electrical field
intensifies across the width of nanowires.

aligned wires. (a) Intensity of light in
the cross section of the nanowire with normal polarization to wire
direction. (b) Same but in parallel polarization. (c) Transmittance
of aligned copper wires with a pitch of 2 μm, a width of 1 μm,
and a thickness of 10–80 nm at a wavelength of 0.3–1
μm.

Also, the bending test was performed to test the
flexibility of
the transparent electrode. In this test, by increasing the bending
radius to 7.5 mm, the electrical resistance increases by only 40%,
indicating good flexibility of the transparent electrode.

The
experimental and simulation results are plotted in terms of
transmittance versus surface resistance Figure 5. The other works with ITO, graphene, and
CNT have also been added for comparison. As it is seen, our experimental
and calculated transparent electrodes show better optical and electrical
properties than the best of the past: random silver mesh, graphene,
and ITO.

Figure 5 Transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm and surface resistance
of the aligned copper mesh for current experimental samples in two
widths of 0.6 and 1 μm and their conformity with simulation
results. Also, other works have been added for comparison.50−59

Our experimental results are shown for two widths
of 0.6 and 1
μm with blue squares and orange rhombuses, and their simulations
with a dashed blue line and the solid orange line, respectively. Good
conformity between experimental and simulated results is seen except
in the upper part of the graph for narrower wires (higher surface
resistance region). In this region, because the thickness of the metal
in addition to the width of the wire is very thin, it is thought that
the effect of growth defects such as impurities, crystalline defects,
cracks, and islands is much higher than those thicker wires; therefore,
the probability of cutting some of the electron pathways within the
thin narrow wires becomes much higher than those in thick and wide
wires. Consequently, experimental results in these regions show higher
resistance than simulation prediction.

For a more precise comparison
of the transparent electrodes produced
under different conditions, we use the redefined figure of merit as
follows 1  where T is transparency, Rs is surface resistance, and TC is defined as
the figure of merit of a transparent electrode. Using this relation,
along with results of transparency measurement and surface resistance,
the TC is represented versus metal thickness for different samples
with a width of 0.6, 1, and 1.5 μm in Figure 6. The dotted lines are related to simulation
and solid lines to experimental results. In cases where the width
wires and the thickness of the metal layer are skinny, the prediction
of the simulation diagram differs from the experimental results of
copper for the reason which already was said. In other cases, there
is perfect conformity.

Figure 6 Figure of merit (TC) of the Cu aligned mesh in three widths
vs
wire thickness. Experimental results are shown by the markers and
simulation results by dotted lines. The vertical axis is in multirange
with three origins.

It can be seen that in all three charts, increasing
the metal thickness
improves the TC figure of merit. As it has already been mentioned,
for low thicknesses, conductivity is more sensitive to crystalline
defects; on the other hand, with increasing thickness, new pathways
are created for restricted electron results in better conditions for
a transparent flexible electrode. It is also observed that the chart
of wider wires has a higher TC, while decreasing the width increases
the electron scattering from boundaries and crystalline defects, which
reduces the conductivity and TC.

The effect of mesh density
(1/pitch) is negligible on the performance
because if in the transparent electrode the density of the wires is
increased, it means that the distance between the wires is decreased,
while the width and thickness of each wire are fixed; consequently,
both surface resistance and transparency are reduced and the figure
of merit TC does not change.

4 Conclusions
By developing a simple
technique which uses a U-shaped collector
in the electrospinning process, we were able to make a flexible copper
electrode with low surface resistance and high transmittance or a
high figure of merit which is related to Rs and T. However, in prior methods, the random wires
were produced on a solid substrate. In that solid substrate, the remaining
components at the deposition step between the wires lead to reduce
transparency and performance. Also, those wires are clinging to the
solid substrate so that transferring them to the other substrate is
accompanied by breaks and wrinkles. Therefore, transferring to various
substrates by making suspended wires became easily accessible.

The results were also compared with the work of others. Because
of the electrical and optical characteristics, it is hoped that our
electrodes have a better performance.
