Bioprinting
has emerged as a valuable three-dimensional (3D) biomanufacturing
method to fabricate complex hierarchical cell-containing constructs.
Spanning from basic research to clinical translation, sterile starting
materials are crucial. In this study, we present pharmacopeia compendial
sterilization methods for the commonly used bioink component alginate.
Autoclaving (sterilization in saturated steam) and sterile filtration followed by lyophilization
as well as the pharmacopeia noncompendial method, ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation
for disinfection, were assessed. The impact of the sterilization methods
and their effects on physicochemical and rheological properties, bioprinting
outcome, and sterilization efficiency of alginate were detailed. Only
sterile filtration followed by lyophilization as the sterilization
method retained alginate’s physicochemical properties and bioprinting
behavior while resulting in a sterile outcome. This set of methods
provides a blueprint for the analysis of sterilization effects on
the rheological and physicochemical pattern of bioink components and
is easily adjustable for other polymers used in the field of biofabrication
in the future.

Introduction
Biofabrication
has emerged as a new and rapidly growing field1 with applications in tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine.2 Generally, biofabrication aims
at the generation of hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) and cell-laden
scaffolds deploying additive manufacturing.3 The systematic combination of polymer—either of synthetic4,5 or natural origin—cells,6,7 and growth
factors leads to so-called bioinks that must fulfill certain characteristics
to be taken into consideration for application in a challenging biological
environment.1 The reader is directed to
excellent review articles on recent developments in the field of biofabrication.8−11

For successfully bridging the gap from research to applied
clinical
practice, reliable and effective sterilization of the applied polymers
is critical during early-stage bioink development.12 Treatment with 70% ethanol has been suggested as a method
for disinfection in biofabrication.12 However,
as a noncompendial method, it is only of limited use for potential
clinical translation. Sterility of biomaterials and implants is mandatory,
as sadly documented by implant-related infections related to increased
patient morbidity and fatalities.13,14 Sterilization
methods include ISO norms (ISO 11737: Sterilization of medical devices)
or sterilization monographs described in different pharmacopeias (USP,
EP, BP, JP). However, due to the requirements of bioinks, sterilization
processes for medical devices (ISO norm) or small molecules and pharmaceutical
relevant polymers in solution (pharmacopeial methods) cannot be directly
transferred. One reason is the temperature stability, which is in
general higher for metals used for load-bearing implants than for
polymers as used in bioinks, causing degradation or chemical changes.
Consequently, it is important to evaluate the suitability of the sterilization
method in line with the physicochemical and mechanical properties
of the sterilized material. Although the number of publications dealing
with biofabrication has been significantly increasing over the last
few years, to the best of our knowledge, only one study investigated
sterility and its influence on material properties.15 In this study, the authors evaluated three sterilization
methods on four frequently used biopolymers and identified ethylene
oxide (EO) treatment as the most promising one. However, this method
is not practicable in every laboratory due to its high safety requirements
and high-cost involvement.16 Furthermore,
EO is challenged in light of the clean air act and under review by
Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA).17

Here, we focus on
pharmacopeia compendial, potentially high throughput,
and cost-effective sterilization methods applicable in routine laboratory
work. To this end, we selected sodium alginate as the bioink component,
a commonly used bioink in 3D bioprinting, and compared the effects
of the sterilization treatment on physicochemical and rheological
properties, bioprinting, and sterilization efficiency.

Results and Discussion
Two compendial sterilization methods, autoclaving (powder and liquid)
and sterile filtration, were compared for their sterilization outcome
on the polysaccharide alginate (Table 1). For comparison, disinfection with ultraviolet (UV)-light
was selected as the noncompendial method.

First, we analyzed the molar
mass distribution of alginate by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements in an aqueous environment
after the sterilization or disinfection process (Figure 1A,B). Compared to the nonsterilized
alginate polymer, a low molecular tailing at larger retention volumes
(5–7 mL) was detected in the RI signal after the autoclaving
process (Figure 1A).
This finding was corroborated by differential pressure changes, which
were lower for autoclaved samples (Figure 2B). Moreover, the resulting number average molar mass (Mn) was statistically significantly lower by 17 and 19
kDa for autoclaved alginate as a powder or in an aqueous solution,
respectively (Figure 2C). The weight average molar mass (Mw) was found to be statistically significantly lower after autoclaving
alginate as an aqueous solution. The Mw dropped from 77 (±5.2) kDa for native alginate to 53 (±5.6)
kDa for the autoclaved alginate. Consequently, dispersity (Đ) was only affected by autoclaving alginate as powder,
which resulted in a value of around 2.0 (±0.03) and a broader,
more heterogenic mass distribution (Figure 2D). These findings corroborate the observations
for gelatin and gelatin methacrylate reported by O’Connell
et al.15

angular frequency of 10 rad/s. (B) Frequency sweep from 0.1 to 100
rad/s with a constant amplitude of 1%. (C) Shear stress sweep and
(D) shear rate sweep from 0.1 to 100 Pa and 0.1 and 100 s–1.

To investigate if the observed
changes in the molar mass distribution
lead to macroscopic effects on printability, in-depth rheology studies
were performed. Oscillatory (Figure 2A,B), as well as rotatory measurements (Figure 2C,D), revealed a distinct impact
on material properties. Considerably lower values for the storage
(G′) and loss modulus (G″)
were found for autoclaved samples compared to UV-treated and filtered
solutions in the performed amplitude sweep (Figure 2A). We hypothesize that the short-chain fragments
that were generated during moist-heat treatment by autoclaving act
as a plasticizer, resulting in a reduced chain entanglement of the
polymer. Consequently, both the stiffness as well as the energy stored
during deformation were reduced, thereby at least in part influencing
the printability of alginate. Importantly, all alginate solutions
used in the present study did not form gels at 8% (w/v), as demonstrated
by G″ > G′ notwithstanding
the sterilization method. The performed frequency sweeps confirmed
the results and revealed an unexpected rheological behavior for the
alginate autoclaved as a powder at frequencies above 10 rad/s (Figure 2B). The elastic component
of the alginate material was found to collapse by the order of 4–5
magnitudes with respect to the last value of the linear region (∼10
rad/s). This finding was reproduced with additional samples of autoclaved
alginate as a powder (n = 3). We assume that the
breakdown of elastic components is related to significant degradation
of the material during the sterilization process. Moreover, autoclaving
caused the disappearance of an explicit yield point present in other
samples at around 10 Pa (Figure 2C). Increasing the shear rate from 0.1 to 100 s–1 revealed shear thinning from 132.9 (±33.6) to
2.8 (±0.1) Pa·s for untreated, from 183.7 (±56.8) to
3.7 (± 0.4) Pa·s for UV-irradiated samples, and from 59.1
(±8.6) to 3.9 (±0.3) Pa·s for sterile-filtered samples
(Figure 2D). This rheological
behavior is typically observed for polymer solutions due to the increasing
orientation of the polymer chains with an increasing shear rate.4,7 The viscosity was significantly lower for autoclaved samples and
only a minor shear-thinning effect due to the amount of low molecular
chain fragments was observed. The viscosity decreased from 6.1 (±0.9)
to 2.2 (±0.1) Pa·s for alginate autoclaved as an aqueous
solution and from 11.8 (±4.5) to 0.9 (± 0.1) Pa·s for
alginate autoclaved as powder.

To this end, we used 3D printing
experiments to analyze if the
observed changes impact the rheology of the autoclaved alginate solutions
and hence their printability (Figure 3). Therefore, line patterns were used as a default
for the 3D printing process (Figure 3A,G).21−24 Two different distances between the lines were used to determine
whether a larger distance has a positive effect on the printability
of the autoclaved alginate solutions. After printing, the autoclaved
solutions, independent of whether autoclaved as powder or solution,
revealed a loss of their shape fidelity (Figure 3E,F,K,L). In these autoclaved solutions,
extrusion leads to wide viscous strands, which immediately merged
into each other resulting in a fully filled construct. The shape-loss
effect was more pronounced with alginate that was autoclaved as a
powder (Supporting Videos S4, S5, S9, and S10). These findings are supported by the changes
in the rheological behavior and reduced molecular weight (Figures 1C and 2) discussed previously. In contrast, printed line structures
for all other alginates (native, UV-irradiated, and sterile-filtered
samples) were preserved and retained their shape. Native, UV-treated,
and sterile-filtered alginate solutions were printable with accuracy
tradeoffs at the points where the printer positioned the needle for
the extrusion of new lines. Moreover, all samples revealed a slight
interlacing of the lines at the turning points of the given line structure.
This finding may be attributed to the absence of CaCl2 for
stabilization of the 3D printed structure by alginate cross-linking.25 As cross-linking is time- and concentration-dependent
and furthermore depends on the available surface in contact with the
cross-linking agent, the addition of CaCl2 was avoided
to allow direct comparison of the printing outcome without postprinting
modification.

sterilization
techniques compared to untreated alginate. (A–F) represents
a nine-line pattern and (G–H) a five-line pattern. (A, G) Preset

was performed on a BioX printer (CELLINK, Gothenburg, Sweden) at 25
°C and 120 kPa air pressure. Solutions were stained with Sicopharm
Cochineal Red (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) for better contrast.

Sodium alginate, approved by the FDA26 as a food-additive, is considered as noncytotoxic.27 To investigate if degradation products formed
during the
sterilization process of alginate influence cell viability, the metabolic
activity of NIH 3T3 cells was monitored deploying WST-1 proliferation
assay with increasing alginate concentrations (Figure 4). It is important to note that no gel formation
occurred due to the use of calcium-free Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM). No significant differences between the
differently sterilized alginates were observed, indicating good cell
compatibility of all alginates after the sterilization process. Important
to note is that only the influence of the material was investigated
while bioprinting was not investigated.

Figure 4 Cell viability was examined
via WST-1 cell proliferation assay
at 450 and 630 nm with increasing alginate concentrations (mean ±
standard deviation, n = 3). Measurements were performed
after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ANOVA
was not significant among tested concentrations of alginates (p-value <0.05).

In a final step, we evaluated the sterility of all samples discussed
above according to the European Pharmacopeia. Beforehand, the inhibitory
effects of all polymer samples were excluded by validation with various
type of strains prescribed in the European Pharmacopeia. Sterility
testing revealed the existence of Bordetella bronchiseptica in the unsterilized starting material and in the UV-treated alginate
sample (Figure S1). In contrast, the sterile-filtered
and subsequently lyophilized alginate sample remained sterile after
14 days of incubation in liquid media. These findings are of major
importance as disinfection by UV-light is frequently used in the field
of biofabrication.

Conclusions
By analyzing pharmacopeia
compendial methods for sterilization
of the model bioink component alginate, we developed sterilization
strategies suitable for sensitive polymers applied in biofabrication.
First, sterilization of a potential bioink should be investigated
in the early phase of bioink development. Second, UV-light treatment
as a noncompendial method was not effective in terms of sterilization
outcomes and should be avoided. Based on the examined methods, we
recommend sterile filtration at low polymer concentrations followed
by lyophilization to obtain both sterile and printable bioinks.

Materials
and Methods
Sodium Alginate Solutions
Sodium alginate (Protanal
LF 10/60 FT) was obtained from FMC BioPolymer (Philadelphia, PA).
Sodium chloride (NaCl), monobasic sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), and dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and
were used without further purification. The lyophilized powders were
stored at −20 °C prior to use.

Sodium alginate solution
was prepared by dissolving sodium alginate powder either native or
sterilized in MilliQ water for 24 h at 35 °C and 600 rpm in a
Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany).

Cell Culture
Material
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; high glucose, no calcium, no glutamine; catalog no.
21068028), fetal bovine serum (FBS; ref 10270-106), and Nunc 96-well
plates were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Schwerte, Germany).
Penicillin G and streptomycin solutions were purchased from Biochrom
AG (Berlin, Germany). Water-soluble tetrazolium salt 1 (WST-1) was
purchased from Roche (Basel, Switzerland).

Sterilization
Autoclave sterilization of sodium alginate
was performed in a DX-90 2D autoclave (Systec, Linden, Germany) according
to the European Pharmacopoeia for 15 min at 121 °C for solutions
and powders. Sterile filtration was performed by filtering the sodium
alginate solution (1%, w/v) through a Filtropur S 0.2 μm polyethersulfone
(PES) syringe filter (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) under a
Safe 2020 clean bench (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). The
filtered samples were then frozen at −80 °C and lyophilized
in syringes equipped with a Filtropur S 0.2 μm syringe filter
for 48 h at 11 μbar. UV-light sterilization of sodium alginate
powder was performed under a TL-900 universal UV lamp (Camag, Muttenz,
Switzerland) at 254 nm wavelength and a distance of 2 cm for 1 h.

Sterility Testing
Sterility testing was conducted at
the Institute for Hygiene and Microbiology of the University of Würzburg
using the Steritest Symbio pump (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The laboratory
is accredited according to the standard DIN EN ISO 17025. Specimen
handling and filtration were conducted under a safety cabinet in a
clean room. The product solutions (4–9 mL) were filtered according
to the manufacturer′s instructions. The system splits the sample
into two parts for separate incubation in thioglycollate broth and
soybean–casein digest medium. Following rinsing with fluid
A (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), the samples were incubated in soybean–casein
digest medium and thioglycollate broth at 23 and 33 °C, respectively,
for 14 days. They were visually inspected for turbidity every working
day. In case of possible bacterial growth, 0.5 mL of the liquid medium
was inoculated each on chocolate agar (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, USA), Schaedler agar with vitamin K1 and 5% sheep blood (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA), and Sabouraud agar with penicillin
and streptomycin (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA). The agar
plates were incubated at 23 or 33 °C for up to 5 days. In the
case of Schaedler agar, incubation took place in an anaerobic atmosphere.
In the case of growth, colonies according to their morphology were
isolated and subjected to Vitek mass spectrometry (MS) analysis for
bacterial species assignment. Validation by assessment of possible
microbial growth inhibition by the product was conducted using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Clostridium sporogenes (ATCC 19404), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) for thioglycollate
broth and Aspergillus brasiliensis (ATCC
16404), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231),
and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) for
soybean–casein digest medium. In none of the strains, a negative
impact of the product on microorganism recovery was observed.

Rheology
Rheological experiments were performed on
the system described below.

A Physica MCR 302 rheometer (Anton
Paar, Graz, Austria) equipped with a heating mantle (H-PTD 200) and
plate–plate geometry (PP25 measuring plate) was utilized. Data
were processed using RheoCompass software version 1.23.378 (Anton
Paar, Graz, Austria).

Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC)
All GPC measurements
were performed on a Malvern Viscotek GPCmax system with an integrated
isocratic pump, autosampler, and a Viscotek 305 TDA triple detector
(Malvern Panalytical, Kassel, Germany). A Phenomenex BioSep SEC-s4000
and SEC-s2000 column in series with 5 μm particle size and 145
Å pore size (4.6 × 300 mm2), and a guard column
at 298 K and 0.05 M PBS at a pH of 6.8 were used. The flow rate was
adjusted to 0.3 mL/min. Prior to each measurement, the samples were
filtered through a Whatman Puradisc 0.2 μm PES syringe filter
(GE Healthcare, Chicago) to remove particles. Data were processed
using OmniSEC software version 5.12 (Malvern Panalytical, Kassel,
Germany).

Cytotoxicity
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded in a microplate
at a concentration of 2000 cells per well in calcium-free DMEM and
incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The following
day, 80 mg/mL stock solutions of alginate in MilliQ water, treated
with different sterilization techniques, were diluted with calcium-free
DMEM to 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/mL and added 1:1 to the fibroblasts
in triplicates resulting in final alginate concentrations of 5, 2.5,
1.25, and 0.625 mg/mL, respectively. After 24 h of incubation at 37
°C and 5% CO2, the solutions were aspirated and the
cells were washed twice with PBS. Afterward, each well was treated
with a mixture of 10 parts DMEM and one part WST-1. Then the absorbance
was measured at 450 nm (soluble formazan product) and 630 nm (background
noise) with a Spectramax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices,
San José, USA).

Statistical Analysis
For statistical
analysis, analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was performed with OriginPro 2017 (OriginLab Corporation,
Northampton, USA). Samples with a p-value <0.05
were considered as statistically significant and are marked with an
asterisk (*).
