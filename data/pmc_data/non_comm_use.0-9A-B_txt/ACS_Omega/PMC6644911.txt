Chiral
self-assembly has drawn increasing interest in supramolecular
chemistry. Here, we have designed amphiphilic l-Pro–l-Glu and l-Pro–d-Glu dipeptides and
investigated their chiral self-assembly as well as asymmetric catalytic
performance to disclose the synergistic effect of two stereogenic
centers in the self-assembly and catalysis. It was found that both
of the diastereomeric dipeptides can easily self-assemble into organogels
with nanofibers. When these nanofibers were used as a catalyst for
the asymmetric aldol reactions, enhanced enantioselectivity was obtained
compared with their molecular state. Moreover, the L–L isomer
assemblies showed higher enantioselectivity than the L–D isomer.
It was revealed that both the supramolecular chirality of the nanofiber
and the chiral catalytic site of l-proline played important
roles in the asymmetric catalysis. In addition, the synergistic effect
of two homochiral centers led to more efficient supramolecular catalysis
that the L–L assemblies showed high yields (up to 97%), anti-diastereoselectivity
(up to 99%), and excellent enantioselectivity (up to >99%).

Introduction
Recently,
chiral self-assembly has drawn great interest because
many of the self-assembly processes including those in biological
systems involve the chirality issue.1−4 Through chiral self-assembly, various chiral
nanostructures such as twists, nanotubes, nanorods, and nanocages
could be obtained, which find further applications in chiroptical
materials, chiral sensing, and enantioselective recognitions.5−15 Among various applications of the chiral nanostructures, the asymmetric
catalysis, which tries to mimic the enzyme reaction, has been attracting
great interest in recent days, whereas the development of chiral molecular
catalysts for asymmetric reactions is still one of the central topic
of organic synthesis and an area of immense interest. Various supramolecular
chiral nanoarchitectures such as nanotubes, nanorods, nanocages, nanofibers,
micelles, and vesicles have been recently employed as catalysts.16−30 Although great development has been achieved in the supramolecular
catalyst, increasing the enantioselectivity and robustness of the
supramolecular catalyst still remains an important issue. Here, we
report a new supramolecular catalyst, which is based on the self-assembly
of amphiphilic dipeptides with two chiral moieties, as shown in (Figure 1). The dipeptide
was composed of l- or d-glutamide connected with
the l-proline moiety. l- or d-glutamide
was employed to facilitate the self-assembly because this unit was
found to have a strong self-assembly capacity.31l-Proline was selected because the amino acid
can serve as a good catalyst for asymmetric reactions.32−39 We designed two dipeptides with homochiral (L–L) and heterochiral
(L–D) centers to see the interplay of two chiral centers in
the self-assembly as well as in the catalysis, which was scarcely
reported before.

Figure 1 Synthesis procedures of amphiphilic gelators.

After the pioneering work done by Hayashi and Barbas,40,41 different types of l-proline-based catalysts such as solid-supported,
ionic liquid-tagged, and polymeric catalysts were developed. However,
only few applications with a supramolecular nanostructure in asymmetric
catalysis were reported. In 2009, Miravet and co-workers used fabricated
proline-based supramolecular hydrogel for application in asymmetric
aldol reactions, and they reached up to 90% enantioselectivity.42−46 Our group synthesized l-proline-containing amphiphilic
dipeptide, which self-assembled into vesicles in water media and showed
excellent enantioselectivity for the aldol reaction.47 Recently, Parquette synthesized proline–lysine-based
dipeptide, which self-assembled into a supramolecular nanotube. With
10 mmol % catalyst loading, excellent enantioselectivity, in certain
cases ee up to 97.5%, was realized.48 However,
the reaction needed 4–5 days. Thus, a more efficient catalyst
with a small amount of catalyst loading , higher reactivity, and enantioselectivity
is still expected.

We have found that our dipeptide can self-assemble
into chiral
nanofibers showing circular dichroism (CD) signals. When these nanofibers
were used as a catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction, with low
catalyst loading (2 mol %), we obtained high isolated yields (up to
97%), higher anti-diastereoselectivity (up to 99%), and enantioselectivity
(ee up to >99%) in the presence of water within 1.5–8 h
of
reaction time at room temperature. Furthermore, it was observed that
this supramolecular catalyst did not perform well in an organic medium.
We have further revealed that the interplay between two chiral centers
in the dipeptides played an important role both in the self-assembly
and in the catalytic effect. The dipeptide with homochiral centers
is more efficient in favoring the chiral self-assembly and higher
enantioselectivity.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembly of the Dipeptides
We synthesized the
dipeptides by the combination of radially available trans-4-hydroxyproline with modified l- or d-glutamide.
First, we protected the secondary amine and acid group of 4-hydroxyproline
and then introduced the bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl
group, with the replacement of hydrogen of the starting material.
Then, we deprotected the ester group for the coupling reaction with
modified glutamide. Finally, we deprotected the boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) group, and we got our desired product.

The
amphiphilic proline based L–L and L–D dipeptides can
easily self-assemble into a white organogel in several organic solvents
such as CH3CN, CH3CN/CHCl3, CH3CN/DCM, and CH3CN/tetrahydrofuran (THF). The gelation
ability of L–L and L–D isomers in these organic solvents
was investigated by the “stable to inversion in a test tube”
method, as shown in Figure 2A. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize
the xerogels from air-dried organogels, as shown in (Figure 2E,F). It was found that one-dimensional
nanofiber structures with a high aspect ratio were obtained for both
L–L and L–D isomers, which is typical of the supramolecular
gels.49 The width of the fibers is about
0.1–0.3 μm. These numerous fibers are intertwined to
form three-dimensional networks, and they immobilize solvents to form
stable supramolecular gels.

solvents; from
left to right, CH3CN, CH3CN/CHCl3, CH3CN/DCM, and CH3CN/THF. (B) CD spectra
of L–L and L–D isomer gels in CH3CN/CHCl3. (C) XRD patterns of L–L and L–D xerogels obtained
from CH3CN/CHCl3. (D) UV–vis spectra
of L–L and L–D gels in CH3CN/CHCl3. (E) SEM image of L–L xerogel formed in CH3CN/CHCl3. (F) SEM image of L–D xerogel formed in CH3CN/CHCl3.

The organogels were further characterized by the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) and CD spectra. Figure 2B,D shows the CD and UV–vis spectra of the organogels.
L–L and L–D isomers both showed an adsorption band at
around 279 nm in the THF gel, ascribed to the proline moiety conjugated
with the amide group. The CD spectra of L–L and L–D
isomers exhibited an obvious difference. As for the L–L isomer,
an obvious positive Cotton effect was observed at around 270 nm, which
is consistent with that of the adsorption band characterized by UV–vis
spectra. On the other hand, it is almost CD silent for the L–D
isomer. This result indicated that the remote chiral center of amphiphilic l-glutamide also has an important effect on the supramolecular
chirality. The homochiral centers are easier for the chiral self-assembly.

Figure 2C shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of L–L and L–D
isomers. L–L xerogel from CH3CN/CHCl3 showed four obvious diffraction peaks, corresponding to a layer
spacing of 3.2, 1.6, 1.1, and 0.8 nm respectively, based on the Bragg’s
equation. The proportion of these spacings is 1:1/2:1/3:1/4, suggesting
a lamellar structure.50 L–D xerogels
from CH3CN/CHCl3 also exhibited a lamellar structure,
which showed a layer spacing of 2.1 nm. The layer spacings of 3.2
and 2.1 nm obtained from the XRD patterns are greater than the L–L
or L–D molecular length (CPK molecular model measured the length
of the molecules to be 1.8 nm), implying that L–L or L–D
self-assemblies are made from the interdigitated bilayer structures,
in which alkyl chains are more densely packed or interdigitated in
the L–D isomer.

To further understand the driving force
for self-assembled nanostructures,
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and temperature-variation NMR spectra
of the L–L gels were investigated. Figure 3A shows characteristic infrared absorption
for hydrogen bonds between N–H and C=O. Two peaks were
observed at the N–H vibration at around 3300–3500 cm–1. The relative strong peaks at 3460 cm–1 for the N–H stretching vibration is observed at L–L
in CH2Cl2 solution, which could be ascribed
to the free amide groups. Upon gel formation, a strong peak was observed
at 3293 cm–1, which can be assigned to the H-bonded
N–H vibrations. In addition, the amide I band at 1647 cm–1 in CH2Cl2 solution shifted
to 1642 cm–1 in the gel, which also confirmed the
H-bond between amide groups in the gel.51 These data indicated that the hydrogen bonding between amide moieties
is the main driving force for the formation of gels.

L–L xerogel obtained from CH3CN/CHCl3 and L–L powder obtained from CH2Cl2. (B) Temperature-dependent 1H NMR spectra
of the L–L isomer in the CD3CN solvent.

Temperature-dependent 1H NMR (Figure 3B) spectra of the
L–L isomer further
confirmed the hydrogen bonding attributed to the self-assembly. The
protons of the amide group (−C=O–NH−)
shift toward the upfield with increasing temperature, supporting that
hydrogen bonding between the amide group is weakened with the increase
of temperature.52,53

Asymmetric Catalysis for
Aldol Reaction by the Nanofibers
After the characterization
of our newly synthesized supramolecular
catalyst, we started to screen the applicability with the L–L
isomer for the asymmetric aldol reaction in the presence of water.
First, an attempt was made between 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone
in the presence of benzoic acid (used as an additive to enhance the
reaction rate) with different amounts of water (0.01–1 mL)
as well as in brine. The reactions were completed within 3 h, and
good yield but low-to-moderate stereoselectivity was obtained (Table 1 entries 1–4).
Even though we increased the catalyst loading from 2 to 5 mol % in
the presence of 0.5 mL of water, still only 70% enantioselectivity
was observed (Table 1 entry 5). Another thing that we observed is that if we increase
the amount of water, then both diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity
decreased.

Parallel to this,
we investigated the reactions with the L–D
isomer in the presence of water and brine (Table 1 entries 7–10). From these experiments,
we observed that in some cases, it took more time to complete the
reactions (Table 1 entries
8, 10), but enantioselectivity increased a little bit. The other parameters
such as yield and diastereoselectivity are almost similar to the previous
result. Thereafter, we also examined the reaction with dichloromethane
(DCM) and obtained low diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Then,
we tried to solve the problem with the help of supramolecular architecture.

For this purpose, we prepared four different supramolecular organogels
where the major solvent was acetonitrile. One organogel was prepared
from pure acetonitrile, and for the other three mixtures, the major
solvent was acetonitrile and cosolvents (6.6%) were chosen as DCM,
THF, and chloroform. After that, we performed one reaction just by
putting all substrates directly on the organogel without evaporation
of the solvent. After completion of the reaction, we checked the selectivity
and observed that it was almost similar to the previous result (64%),
but it took almost 3 days to complete the reaction (Table 1 entry 12). Then, we evaporated
the solvent from the four organogels and investigated the aldol reaction
directly by putting the substrates on the xerogel under the same reaction
conditions (Table 1 entries 13–17).

Surprisingly it was observed that in
the presence of the supramolecular
nanocatalyst, diastereoselectivity as well as enantioselectivity increased
significantly. Moreover, less time (only 2 h) was required to complete
the reaction than the previous one (Table 1 entries 13–17). The main remarkable
observation is that, for the unassembled catalyst, we found only 36%
enantioselectivities (Table 1 entry 2), and whenever it changed to the form of a supramolecular
catalyst, it provided us high enantioselectivities (95%) under the
same reaction conditions (Table 1 entry 14). Among the four xerogels, the combination
of acetonitrile/chloroform worked very well than others. Thereafter,
we tried all reactions with the xerogels, which are made from acetonitrile/chloroform
mixture. Then, we tried one more reaction with 1 mol % catalyst loading,
but diastereo- and enantioselectivities both were decreased slightly
(Table 1 entry 17).
From the results we can say that the supramolecular nanostructure
is solely responsible for the enhancement of high enantioselectivity
in this particular reaction.

Inspired from this new finding,
we investigated the substituent
effects of various aromatic aldehydes and different ketones in the
aldol reaction to identify the scope and limitations of the supramolecular
catalyst under optimized conditions. The results are summarized in Table 2.

e Reaction performed
with the L–D
isomer.

From Table 2, we
can see that the reaction between cyclohexanone and aromatic aldehydes
containing an electron-withdrawing group led to very good yields (up
to 97%), high diastereoselectivity (up to 99:1), and excellent enantioselectivities
(up to 95%) within 1.5–8 h. Here, we tried to examine almost
all kinds of substrates such as electron donating and electron withdrawing
as well as polycyclic aromatic aldehydes and different types of ketones
in the reaction. In case of the electron-donating group present in
aldehyde such as 2-methoxylbenzaldehyde, the product with 93% ee was
obtained within 6 h. Furthermore, for a polycyclic aromatic aldehyde
such as 2-naphthaldehyde, we obtained 92% ee (Table 2 entry 10). We also examined the electron-donating
group such as methoxy in the 3-position as well as methyl in the 4-position
of the aromatic aldehyde, and we observed good yields and enantioselectivities
(Table 2 entries 11–12).

Next, we tried to broaden the substrate scope of this methodology
with some unsymmetrical ketones such as tetrahydropyran-4-one, tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one, tert-butyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate, and 4-methylcyclohexanone
as donors. They provided good yield and enantioselectivities (up to
95%). We also examined with the cyclopentanone type of ketone and
observed >99% ee within only 2 h of reaction. Except aliphatic
aldehyde,
almost all type of aromatic aldehydes as well as different kinds of
ketones were examined. From Table 2, we observed very promising catalytic efficacy of
the supramolecular nanocatalyst.

Then, we investigated the efficiency
of another L–D isomer
of our supramolecular catalyst in the same reaction under optimized
conditions. It showed almost parallel diastereoselectivity and somewhat
lower enantioselectivities than the L–L isomer (Table 2 entries 18–21). Furthermore,
in most cases, poor chemical yield (64–82%) and long reaction
time (4–48 h) were observed.

From the above results,
we can propose a possible mechanism for
the self-assembly and reaction, as illustrated in Figure 4. Both amphiphilic dipeptides
can self-assemble into nanofibers through a multi-bilayer unit. In
these nanofibers, the active catalytic center l-proline is
located on the surface of the nanofibers. Because of accumulation
of the surface of the nanofiber, the localized concentration of substrates
was increased and the reaction was accelerated. On the other hand,
with respect to the asymmetric reaction, not only the catalytic site
by l-proline but also the collective or supramolecular chirality
will significantly affect the enantioselectivity of the reaction.
In the case of the L–L isomer, the compound formed a nanofiber
showing a strong positive supramolecular chirality. Both the supramolecular
and molecular chiralities of l-proline synergistically play
in catalyzing the aldol reaction, and thus a maximum 99% enantioselectivity
was reached. In the L–D isomers, although the molecular chirality
of the active catalyst is the same, the collective chirality of the
fiber was not as efficient as those from the homochiral dipeptide.
Thus, we observed the decrease of enantioselectivity. Apart from this,
we also examined the same reaction in water as well as in organic
media with two new catalytic systems (L–L 1 and L–D
1) prepared by substituted proline with l/d-glutamic
acid diethyl ester hydrochloride to check the requirement of supramolecular
self-assembly. In case of applicability, we obtained moderate diastereoselectivity
and poor to average enantioselectivities (up to 76%) for all cases.
That means, the long chain glutamide scaffold helps for the process
of supramolecular self-assembly and also increases the H-bonding amide
moiety, which is very important for the catalysis. We can now easily
conclude that supramolecular chirality definitely plays a major role
for obtaining higher selectivity (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Illustration of the possible mechanism for the self-assembly
in
asymmetric aldol reaction.

It should be noted that the solvent also has an effect on
the self-assembly
of the amphiphile dipeptide. Whereas the organic solvent can possibly
cause the disassembly of the nanofiber in the reaction media, the
addition of a small amount of water will be very efficient in maintaining
the nanostructure, and thus we obtained higher yield and enantioselectivity.

Finally, the reusability of the catalyst is also another important
parameter of the efficient catalyst. Here, we have done experiments
by the following method of List and Singh.54,55 First, the aldol reaction was carried out with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
(1 mmol), cyclohexanone (4 mmol), supramolecular catalyst (0.02 mmol),
and benzoic acid (0.02 mmol) in 0.1 mL of water at room temperature.
The disappearance of the starting material was monitored by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC). After completion of the reaction, the aldehyde
and ketone were again added to the reaction mixture without adding
the other things. The same procedure was repeated six times (Figure 5 cycle 1–6),
and it produced a high yield and overall 92% enantioselectivities.
On the other hand, we also examined the reaction with low catalyst
loading (0.3 mol %) under the same reaction conditions and obtained
the product with good yield and 86% enantioselectivities (Figure 5 cycle 7). So, from
the result, definitely we can say that the continuous cycle process
is appropriate for this reaction.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have synthesized dipeptides composed of l-proline
and glutamic acid with homochiral and heterochiral centers
to investigate their self-assembly as well as asymmetric catalysis.
Both of the compounds could self-assemble into nanofibers and immobilized
the solvent to form organogels. However, the dipeptide with homochiral
centres was more efficient in forming the nanofibers, showing an obvious
supramolecular chirality. When these fibers were used as catalysts
for the asymmetric aldol reaction, high isolated yields (up to 97%),
anti-diastereoselectivity (up to 99%), and enantioselectivity (up
to >99%) were obtained in the presence of water. For this catalytic
process, only 2 mol % of the catalyst was used to complete the reaction
within a very short span of time (1.5–8 h). The catalyst could
also be reused by the continuous cycle process for up to six cycles
without a significant loss of catalytic activity. It was found that
the molecular state catalyst could only provide lower enantioselectivity
(36%). Thus, it is concluded that both the collective or supramolecular
chirality and molecular chirality played an important role in the
asymmetric catalysis, whereas the synergistic play of two chiral centers
contributed to the supramolecular chirality of the nanofibers. The
present result opens new possibility in the design of a supramolecular
catalyst for asymmetric reactions.

Experimental Details
General
All aldehydes, ketones, and other reagents
were used as received. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on Bruker AV400 MHz spectrophotometers using trimethylsilane
as an internal standard and CDCl3 as a dissolving solvent.
Chemical shifts were given in parts per million (δ-scale). Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(MS) spectra were recorded on a BIFLEIII instrument. SEM was carried
out on a Hitachi S4300 FE-SEM microscope. UV and CD spectra were recorded
on JASCO UV-550 and JASCO J-810 CD spectrophotometers, respectively.
XRD was measured on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Japan)
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), which was operated
at 45 kV, 100 mA. TLC was performed by precoated plates (Merck Kieselgel
60 F254) and checked with UV light (254 nm) or aqueous
potassium permanganate solution. Flash column chromatography was performed
using 200–300 mesh silica gel, and n-hexane
and ethyl acetate were used as eluents. FT-IR spectra were recorded
on a spectrometer where KBr was used for the preparation of the pellets.
Enantiomeric ratio was determined by chiral high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with chiral columns (chiralpak AS-H column,
chiralpak AD-H column, and chiralpak OD-H column), and HPLC grade
isopropyl alcohol (IPA)/hexane was used as an eluent. The absolute
configurations of the products were determined with comparison of
the retention time from the literature.56,57

Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared by the known procedure;58 thereafter, trans-N-Boc-4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-l-proline 2 (56 mg, 0.16 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (4.7 mL) and cooled
to 0 °C. Then, 1-hydroxybenzotrizole (0.032 g) was added to the
solution, and the mixture was stirred for 5 min at the same temperature.
After that, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride
(0.046 g) was added to the mixture and stirred for 5 min, and finally
amine 3(59) (78 mg, 0.16 mmol)
was added. The mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred
for 18 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC, and after completion
of the reaction, it was washed with 10% citric acid (2 × 30 mL),
saturated NaHCO3 (2 × 30 mL), and brine (1 ×
30 mL). The collected organic portion was dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator.
Crude boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protected product 4 was obtained as a white solid. The crude reaction mixture
was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (50% EtOAc/hexane)
to give the product as a white solid (0.110 g, 85% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.15 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 1H), 7.33 (t, J = 5.1 Hz, 1H), 6.47 (t, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 4.36–4.27 (m, 3H), 3.68 (dd, J = 10.8 Hz, 1H), 3.40 (dd, J = 10.7 Hz,

Then N-Boc-protected compound 4 (966
mg, 1.194 mmol) was dissolved in 8.23 mL of mixture solvent trifluoroacetic
acid/DCM = (1:4) and stirred for 6 h under an argon atmosphere at
room temperature. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was
removed by a rotary evaporator, and the residue was redissolved with
CHCl3 and washed with NaHCO3 solution (3 ×
30 mL), water (2 × 30 mL), and brine (2 × 30 mL). The resulting
organic portion was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Then, it was subjected
to flash column chromatography (MeOH/EtOAc = 10/90) on silica gel
to give the desired product 5 as a white solid (0.609
g, 72% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ
8.50 (d, J = 7 Hz, 1H), 6.40 (t, J = 5.3 Hz, 1H), 5.34 (t, J = 5.1 Hz, 1H), 4.51–4.38

3292, 3096, 2922, 1558, 1468, 1253, 1077, 901, 776 cm–1. MALDI-TOF-MS: (M + H)+ calcd for C40H80N4O4Si, 709.59; found, 709.60. Same
procedure was followed for the preparation of compound 6. d-Glutamic acid was taken instead of l-glutamic
acid.

General Procedure for the Enantioselective Direct Aldol Reaction
First, xerogel of nanocatalyst 5 (0.02 mmol) was taken,
and then, acid additive (benzoic acid, 0.02 mmol), ketone (4.00 mmol),
and water (0.1 mL) were mixed with it. After 15 min of stirring, aromatic
aldehyde (1.00 mmol) was added and stirred at room temperature for
the mentioned time. The reaction was monitored by TLC, and after completion
of the reaction, it was quenched with 10 mL of saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL) and brine
(10 mL). Then, the organic solvent was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated by a rotary evaporator. Thereafter, the crude
mixture was purified by column chromatography to afford the pure chiral
product. Finally, enantioselectivity was determined by chiral HPLC
analysis, and the ratio of syn and anti was examined with the crude
mixture by NMR spectroscopy.
