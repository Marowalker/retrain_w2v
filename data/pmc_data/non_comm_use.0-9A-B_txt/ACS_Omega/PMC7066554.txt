Poly(aspartic acid) (PAA) is a biodegradable water-soluble
anionic polymer that can potentially replace poly(acrylic acid) for
industrial applications and has shown promise for regenerative medicine
and drug delivery. This paper describes an efficient and sustainable
route that uses protease catalysis to convert l-aspartate
diethyl ester (Et2-Asp) to oligo(β-ethyl-α-aspartate),
oligo(β-Et-α-Asp). Comparative studies of protease activity
for oligo(β-Et-α-Asp) synthesis revealed α-chymotrypsin
to be the most efficient. Papain, which is highly active for l-glutamic acid diethyl ester (Et2-Glu) oligomerization,
is inactive for Et2-Asp oligomerization. The assignment
of α-linkages between aspartate repeat units formed by α-chymotrypsin
catalysis is based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) trifluoacetic
acid titration, circular dichroism, and NMR structural analysis. The
influence of reaction conditions (pH, temperature, reaction time,
and buffer/monomer/α-chymotrypsin concentrations) on oligopeptide
yield and average degree of polymerization (DPavg) was
determined. Under preferred reaction conditions (pH 8.5, 40 °C,
0.5 M Et2-Asp, 3 mg/mL α-chymotrypsin), Et2-Asp oligomerizations reached maximum oligo(β-Et-α-Asp)
yields of ∼60% with a DPavg of ∼12 (Mn 1762) in just 5 min. Computational modeling
using Rosetta software gave relative energies of substrate docking
to papain and α-chymotrypsin active sites. The substrate preference
calculated by Rosetta modeling of α-chymotrypsin and papain
for Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu oligomerizations, respectively,
is consistent with experimental results.

==== Body
Introduction
Polycarboxylates such as poly(malic acid),1−6 poly(glutamic acid) (PGA),7,8 and poly(aspartic acid)
(PAA)9−14 are alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable polyanionic materials
(e.g., polyacrylic acid) that are used in a wide variety of products.
The poor hydrolytic stability of ester-linked poly(malic acid) is
problematic for commodity applications. In contrast, PAA and PGA have
amide-linked backbones with sufficient hydrolytic stability that enable
their use in a wide range of industrial applications.

Poly(α,β-dl-aspartate)s, T-PAA, from high-temperature condensation polymerization
(see below), are of substantial interest for industrial processes.
T-PAA inhibits deposition of various calcium (e.g., calcium carbonate,
calcium sulfate, and calcium phosphate) and barium salts and, therefore,
is a potential substitute for PAA in water-treatment applications.15,16 The T-PAA used for such applications has an Mw, Mn, and Mw/Mn of 5200, 1800, and 2.9, respectively.16 T-PAA hydrogels are pH-, salt-, and temperature-responsive.17 These hydrogels can function in a variety of
applications such as personal care and biomedical systems.17 Other potential industrial applications for
T-PAA include as ingredients in cleaning formulations and as oil field
treatment additives.18 PAA is under study
for biomedical applications such as hydrogels,19 gene delivery assemblies,20 polyelectrolyte
films,21 nanoparticle drug-delivery systems,22 scaffolding for tissue growth,23 artificial skin, and so forth.24

There are several different synthetic routes to PAAs. For
large-scale industrial applications, T-PAA is synthesized at high
temperature (∼180 and 230 °C) such that acrylic acid is
converted to polysuccinimide which is subsequently hydrolyzed under
alkaline conditions to give T-PAA.9 Another
route to T-PAA is via polymerization of maleic acid produced from
reaction of ammonia and maleic anhydride.25,26 However, T-PAA synthesis is energy-intensive and gives polymers
with irregular structures. The latter is due to racemization of stereocenters
and ring-opening of succinimide units that leads to about 30% α-linkages
and 70% β-linkages. Furthermore, branching and cross-linking
can occur during the polymerization process.27

PAA is also synthesized via formation and subsequent ring-opening
polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers.24,28 The corresponding NCA–PAA is normally linear and enantiopure.
NCA-ROP also allows for the preparation of polypeptides in high molecular
weight, controlled dispersity, and with unnatural and [D]-enantiomer
repeat units.29 Habraken et al.28 reported the synthesis of γ-benzyl-l-glutamate with an Mn up to 22 200
and Mw/Mn as
low as 1.09. However, NCA-ROP requires protection–deprotection
chemistry to avoid initiation by nucleophilic amino acid side chain23,30 toxic phosgene-based chemicals to cyclize amino acids forming NCA
monomers, organic solvents for synthesis, exhaustive purification
of NCA monomers, and strictly anhydrous and often inert atmospheric
conditions.22,24−31

This paper aims at developing alternative environmentally
friendly (“green”) routes to PAA. For this, we turn
to protease-catalyzed peptide synthesis (PCPS) routes to PAA (p-PAA).
Kinetically driven PCPS occurs under mild conditions (e.g., 30–40
°C) and uses amino acids in their ethyl ester (Et-AA) form. Enzyme
selectivity often results in the formation of peptides with uniform
α-linked AAs while mild reaction conditions avoid racemization
during enzymatic polymerizations.32−34

Thus far, reports
of PCPS routes to p-PAA are sparse and lack information on how the
enzyme structure results in differences in substrate specificity.
Uemura et al. reported that polyethylene glycol 10 000-modified
papain catalyzes the oligomerization of Et2-Asp in benzene
giving an oligomer mixture with chain lengths from a heptamer to decamer.
However, when the oligomerization reaction was performed in aqueous
media, a switch in substrate specificity occurred such that oligo(Asp)
was not formed.35 Matsumura et al. reported
an alkalophilic proteinase (AP) from Streptomyces sp-catalyzed Et2-Asp oligomerization occurring after
3 days, with 88% α-linkages and an average molecular weight
(Mw) up to 2500 determined by size exclusion
chromatography.36 Soeda et al. reported
that Et2-Asp is oligomerized by a bacterial protease from Bacillus subtilis BS in organic media (e.g., acetonitrile)
that contains about 4.5% water.37 Reactions
conducted for 2 days gave α-linked oligo(β-ethyl l-aspartate) and oligo(β-Et-α-Asp), in yields up to 85%, Mw by gel permeation chromatography up to 3700
and a chain length distribution from mass-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) of 5–20 (the highest peak intensity at 10 units, Mn = 1500).37 However,
these previous studies are limited in their scientific value because
(i) the activity of proteases used is not defined by a standard assay,
(ii) an alkalophilic protease from a Streptomyces sp and a bacterial protease from B. subtilis BS are not sufficiently classified and identified to determine the
structure of the protease used. For (i) and (ii), the abovementioned
information on the protease activity, source, and structure is essential
to enable others to repeat the published methods and investigate mechanisms
on a molecular level. It is also important to avoid organic solvents
during PCPS oligomerizations and to complete reactions within a few
hours and not days for potential commercial adoption.

Although
the potential of many common commercial proteases to catalyze Et2-Asp oligomerizations remains uninvestigated, there are a
substantial number of publications that describe the use of readily
available proteases to convert Et2-Glu to oligo(Glu).32,38,39 Uyama et al. reported that papain,
bromelain, and α-chymotrypsin are all active for Et2-Glu oligomerization giving α-linked oligo(γ-Et-Glu).
Oligomer chain lengths ranged from 5 to 9 residues, and the highest
yield was 80% after a 24 h reaction.39 Aso
et al. reported papain-catalyzed oligomerization of Et2-Glu that gave a 65% yield of oligo(γ-Et-Glu) in 3 h with a
DPavg of 7–9.38 Later,
Li et al. reported papain-catalyzed Et2-Glu oligomerization
in phosphate buffer (40 °C, 1 h) to give oligo(γ-Et-Glu)
in 81% yield with a DPavg of 8–9.32 Papain also proved to be an effective catalyst for co-oligomerizations
of Et2-Glu with Et-Tyr and Et-Leu.39,40

Computational studies have provided molecular insights into
peptide hydrolysis reactions by papain41−44 and α-chymotrypsin45,46 and, to a lesser extent, peptide bond synthesis via aminolysis.47 Modeling protease substrate interactions in
the papain system using Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM)
approaches provided insights into the stereopreference of papain-catalyzed
oligomerization of l-alanine over d-alanine via
aminolysis reactions.47 However, previous
studies have not conducted a comparative analysis of different enzyme–substrate
pairs to obtain insights into the molecular bases for experimentally
observed substrate preferences, possibly because of the large computational
expense associated with QM/MM approaches. We reasoned that modeling
the molecular interactions between substrates and enzymes using the
enzyme design framework we developed with Rosetta software would allow
us to rapidly and efficiently identify the steric and energetic factors
that determine the exactitude of fit for different substrates within
papain and chymotrypsin active sites. These calculations align well
with our experimental observations and thus inform a molecular-level
understanding of specificity differences observed herein.

The
focus of this work is (i) determining differences in activity of common
commercially available proteases (α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain,
and bromelain) for oligomerization of Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu oligomerizations, (ii) based on this information, developing
a well-defined and repeatable route to prepare oligo(Asp), and (iii)
gaining a molecular-level understanding of observed differences in
protease selectivity by computational methods. The results reveal
that papain and α-chymotrypsin have remarkably different activities
for these similar substrates. Because α-chymotrypsin was found
to be an effective catalyst for oligo(Et2-Asp) synthesis,
studies were then performed to elucidate the extent that reaction
parameters (pH, reaction time, and concentrations of buffer, monomer,
and protease) influence α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed Et2-Asp oligomerizations. The results of this work led to an efficient
PCPS route to oligo(β-Et-Asp). We then used computational modeling
with Rosetta software to interrogate on a molecular-level selectivity
difference found between papain- and α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed
Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu oligomerizations.

Experimental Section
Materials
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
grade l-aspartic acid diethyl ester hydrochloride (Et2-Asp) with 99.8% purity and α-chymotrypsin from bovine
pancreas with 94% protein were purchased from Chem-Impex International. l-Glutamic acid diethyl ester hydrochloride (Et2-Glu)
was purchased from TCI. Crude papain from Carica papaya (30 000 USP units/mg of solid) was purchased from Calbiochem
Co. Ltd. Trypsin from bovine pancreas and bromelain from pineapple
stem were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium phosphate dibasic
trihydrate, casein, trichloroacetic acid, sodium carbonate anhydrous,
sodium acetate trihydrate, calcium acetate, and l-tyrosine
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Folin & Ciocalteu’s
phenol reagent was purchased from MP Biomedicals. All the abovementioned
chemicals, reagents, and enzymes were obtained in the highest available
purity and were used as received.

Methods
General Procedure for Protease-Catalyzed Synthesis of Oligo(β-Et-Asp)
Et2-Asp in the L-stereochemical configuration (1.128
g, 5 mmol) and 10 mL of phosphate buffer solution were transferred
to a 50 mL Eppendorf tube. The solution was set to a predetermined
pH, and protease (16 units/mL) was added to the reaction mixture.
The tube was gently stirred in a water bath at 40 °C for a predetermined
reaction time. The pH of the reaction media was controlled by automated
titration as described below. Reactions were terminated by acidifying
to pH 3 with 3 M HCl, cooled to room temperature, and 20 mL of distilled
water was added. The insoluble product was separated by centrifugation
(9000 rpm) and washed twice with cold distilled water. The resulting
product was lyophilized giving a white powder. 1H NMR (500
MHz, DMSO-d6) spectrum of oligo(l-Asp): δ = 1.17 (t, 3H, CH3 of Et), δ = 2.5–2.8 (m, 2H, CH2), δ = 3.75 (m, 1H, CH end group), δ = 4.05 (q, 2H, CH2 of Et), δ = 4.56 (m, 1H,
CH), δ = 8.0–8.3 (m, 1H, NH).

Procedure for Reduction of Oligo(β-Et-Asp)
To
a suspension of 110 mg (0.82 mmol ethyl ester units) of oligo(β-Et-Asp)
in chloroform (5 mL) at 0 °C, 2 M LiAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran
(1.2 mL, 2.4 mmol) was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was warmed
to room temperature and stirred for 18 h. The reaction was then quenched
with 1 M HCl(aq) for 30 min and the mixture was dialyzed against distilled
water for 24 h. The resulting reduced peptide was freeze-dried and
analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for linkage assignment.

Control of the Reaction pH
Because the pH decreases
during oligomerizations, an automated pH control was employed. A tiamo
titration control system and Metrohm CH9101 dosing unit were used.
The dosing solution (1.0 M NaOH) was added at up to 0.1 mL/min, and
the frequency at which the probe checked the pH was set to 1.0 s.
The reaction medium pH was controlled within 0.05 units of the set
value.

Protease Activity Assay
Protease activity was measured
following the Universal Protease Activity Assay protocol using casein
as the substrate as previously reported.48,49

Instrumental Methods
NMR Spectroscopy
1D and 2D proton (1H) NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian spectrometer at 500 MHz or a Bruker spectrometer
at 600 MHz. 1D 1H and 13C NMR experiments were
performed in DMSO-d6 at 10–30 mg/mL
oligopeptides with a data acquisition delay of 1 s and a total of
64–128 scans. 2D 1H NMR experiments (1H–1H COSY) were performed in DMSO-d6 at 30 mg/mL with 128 scans. Data collection and analysis
were performed using MestReNova software. Proton chemical shifts were
referred to tetramethylsilane at 0.00 pm. The solvent-induced helix–coil
transition was investigated by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) that
covered a range of concentrations from 0 to 10% (v/v) to peptide (50
mg) dissolved in 5 mL of CDCl3. All spectra were recorded
at 25 °C.

Mass-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time-of-Flight
MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded using a Bruker ultraflex III MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated in a positive ion linear
mode with an accelerating potential of +20 kV. A saturated solution
of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 66% acetonitrile, 33% distilled
water, and 1% TFA was used as the matrix.

Circular Dichroic Measurements
Circular dichroism (CD)
spectra were recorded on a Jasco 815 Spectrometer using a 2 mm quartz
cell at 25 °C. Peptides (0.2 mg/mL) in CHCl3 were
prepared for measurements. All the spectra were obtained in the wavelength
region between 180 and 260 nm.

Protease Active Site Modeling
Computational modeling
of acyl–enzyme intermediates was performed with the RosettaScripts
application utilizing the module enzdes (enzyme design) in the Rosetta
software suite and scored by the talaris_2014 score function.50,51 Initial chemical structures of Et2-Glu and Et2-Asp and their respective hydrolyzed intermediates were created with
Avagadro.52 These chemical structures generated
a set of 200 conformers using the conformational generation tool in
the program mercury, curated by the CCDC.53

The protein crystal structures for papain (9pap) and α-chymotrypsin
(1yph) were used for enzyme modeling, with the acyl–enzyme
intermediate geometry determined from chymotrypsin (1oxg) and papain
(2bu3).54−57 Papain and α-chymotrypsin were prepared by a FastRelax protocol
with heavy constraints for initial minimization. Using the geometry
determined from the 1oxg and 2bu3 crystal structures, enzdes constraints
were developed between the hydrolyzed acyl intermediate, the attacking
diester nucleophile, and the catalytic triads of papain and α-chymotrypsin.
The geometry of the acyl–enzyme complex was used to create
starting placements of the hydrolyzed acyl intermediates and the attacking
nucleophiles within the context of both papain and α-chymotrypsin.
Because there are two orientations by which the nucleophile can dock
in the enzyme to attack the acyl intermediate, two sets of geometries
were created with flipped orientations of the diester, designated
c1 and c2.

Sampling of the acyl–enzyme complex was performed
through an initial two runs of repack on the enzyme active site (specifically
on both the acyl intermediate and the attacking nucleophile) to alleviate
clashes between the small molecules and the enzyme, followed by four
minimization and repacking steps on the full acyl–enzyme complex
pocket. The abovementioned small molecule conformers were used to
simulate the flexibility of the diesters and hydrolyzed intermediates.
Constraints were applied such that only the enzyme pocket and small
molecules would be sampled. This sampling was repeated 50 times for
each set of docked complexes for a total of 16 acyl–enzyme
complexes: two sets for each enzyme (papain or α-chymotrypsin),
two sets for each linkage modeled (α and β or γ),
two sets for either the glutamic or aspartic acid diester oligomerization,
and a final two sets for each potential orientation that the nucleophile
can dock into the enzyme to attack the acyl intermediates (c1 and
c2).

Results and Discussion
Schemes of kinetically driven
PCPS are available in previous publications.32 In summary, prior to peptide bond formation, an enzyme–acyl
intermediate is formed between the carbonyl of an activated amino
acid and the cysteine hydroxyl or serine thiol functional groups at
the protease active site. Then, the enzyme-activated substrate complex
is de-acylated by the nucleophilic attack of the free amine of another
amino acid monomer or oligomer (the preferred nucleophile) or water.
The former case will result in peptide bond formation and chain propagation,
whereas hydrolysis will result in a deactivated carboxylic acid group.
When the peptide reaches a chain length where it is no longer soluble
in the reaction medium, it precipitates, shifting the reaction equilibrium
to peptide formation. During peptide bond formation, HCl is liberated
into the reaction medium thereby decreasing its pH. In order to maintain
optimal protease activity, a sodium hydroxide solution was added to
the reaction mixture by an automated dosing unit. In all studies described
below, the L-stereochemical configuration of Et2-Asp and
Et2-Glu was used.

Comparative Activity of Proteases for Aspartate and Glutamate
Diethyl Ester Oligomerization
In previous work by Li et al.,
papain was found to be an excellent catalyst for conversion of Et2-Glu to oligo(γ-Et-Glu) giving this product in ∼81%
yield within about 15 min.32 Furthermore,
α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and bromelain are common commercial
proteases with broad specificities for peptide synthesis.32,36,37,39 Because the structures of Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu
differ by only one methylene group between the α-carbon and
the β- and γ-carboxyl groups, respectively, we determined
the relative ability of these catalysts to effectively prove the hypothesis
that papain would also be an effective catalyst for oligo(β-Et-Asp)
synthesis. Table 1 lists
results of Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu oligomerizations
using α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and bromelain. The activity
of each protease was determined by the Universal Protease Activity
Assay using casein as the substrate (see Experimental
Section). For each protease, the quantity of the enzyme used
is that which results in 16 units/mL activity where a unit is the
release of 1 μmol of tyrosine from casein at 37 °C min–1 mL–1. Protease activities in unit
mg–1 mL–1 are given as a footnote
in Table 1. Hence,
activity differences of the four proteases are normalized by adjusting
the amount of protease to give 16 units/mL activity in reaction solutions.
The results as shown in Table 1 reveal that papain and α-chymotrypsin have opposite
specificities for Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu. The reaction
times are based on monitoring the pH drop that corresponded to base
addition by the pH-stat to maintain the pH at 8.5 (see Experimental Section). When base addition ceased, indicating
completion of the reaction, the reaction was terminated. If reactions
were continued beyond this point, reverse hydrolysis would likely
occur. No precipitation was observed for papain-catalyzed Et2-Asp oligomerizations over a 1 h reaction time. During this reaction
time, there was no evidence of oligomerization based on pH-stat monitoring.
Furthermore, analysis of the supernatant by LC–mass spectrometry
(MS) showed that only the monomer remained and no low chain length
oligomers were formed. In contrast, by 5 min, α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed
Et2-Asp oligomerization gave a ∼58% yield of oligo(Et-Asp),
while the yield of oligo(Et-Glu) at 1 h was significantly less (16%).
Trypsin also catalyzes the oligomerization of Et2-Asp and
Et2-Glu giving yields of 15 and 5%, respectively. Furthermore,
bromelain was a poor catalyst for oligomerizations of both Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu giving yields of 0 and 3%, respectively.

a Reactions were performed in 0.6
M phosphate buffer with 0.5 M monomer at pH 8.5 and 40 °C.

b An activity unit for each protease
is the quantity in mg that results in the release of 1 μmol
of tyrosine min–1 mL–1 in buffer
solution at 37 °C. The activity of α-chymotrypsin, trypsin,
papain, and bromelain by the casein hydrolysis assay is 5.68, 3.31,
0.895, and 0.88 units mg–1 mL–1, respectively.48,49 The amount of protease was normalized
so that, for each protease, the weight corresponding to 16 units mg–1 mL–1 was used for oligomerizations.

c Reaction times were determined
by monitoring the pH drop that corresponded to base addition by the
pH-stat to maintain the pH at 8.5 (see Experimental
Section). When base addition ceased, indicating completion
of the reaction, the reaction was terminated.

d Determined by the weight of the precipitated polymer
over the theoretical weight of the product formed in 100% yield.

e The assertion that no reaction
occurred when papain and bromelain were catalysts for Et2-Asp oligomerization is based on both the absence of precipitate
formation and analysis of the supernatant by LC–MS that showed
only a monomer and no low chain length oligomers.

Time Course Study: α-Chymotrypsin-Catalyzed Et2-Asp Oligomerization
Considering the promising results of
α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed Et2-Asp oligomerization,
further studies were performed to determine how changes in the reaction
time, temperature, pH, and concentrations of the buffer/enzyme/monomer
affect the peptide yield and DPavg. Figure 1 displays the results of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed
oligo(Et-Asp) synthesis as a function of time at 25 and 40 °C
(see Figure 1 legend
for reaction conditions). The oligomerization yield, determined by
gravimetric analysis of the precipitated product, proceeded rapidly.
Analysis of the precipitated product by 1H NMR (see below)
confirmed that it is in fact oligo(Et-Asp). For reactions at 25 and
40 °C, the product formed within the first 10 s of protease addition.
The yield reached 22–28% at 30 s and increased rapidly during
the first 2 min. By 5 min, the yields reached maximum values of 58
and 54% at 40 and 25 °C, respectively. Further increase in the
reaction time at 25 °C shows that the yield plateaued at 54%.
This is likely due to product formation during the 5 min reaction
time along with a low molecular weight water-soluble coproduct (the
latter was not experimentally verified). Furthermore, by 5 min, the
reaction at 25 °C appeared highly viscous which results in diffusion
constraints that will slow down product hydrolysis after precipitation.
In contrast, at 40 °C, a decrease in % yield occurred during
extended reaction times (Figure 1). This is explained by the relatively lower viscosity
at 40 °C that enables protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of ester
or amide groups of precipitated products converting them to the water-soluble
coproduct. Given what appears to be a slightly more rapid oligomerization
at 40 °C at 5 min, further investigations of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed
synthesis of oligo(Et-Asp) are performed at 40 °C.

of oligo(aspartate) synthesis based on the yield of the precipitated
product for reactions performed at 25 and 40 °C consisting of
0.3 M Et2-Asp, 2 mg/mL α-chymotrypsin, and 0.6 M
phosphate buffer at pH 8.5. The inserted graph shows the expansion
of the 0.5–5 min region.

Structural Analysis
The 1D 1H NMR spectrum
of Et2-Asp and the corresponding oligo(Et-Asp), synthesized
by α-chymotrypsin catalysis for 15 min (reaction conditions
are in the Figure 2 legend), is displayed in Figure 2 along with peak assignments. Confirmation of peak
assignments was based on 2D 1H–1H COSY
and 2D HSQC NMR experiments (see Figures S1 and S2, respectively). Further confirmation of peak assignments
resulted from the comparison of the monomer and peptide peak signal
positions and broadening. First, the amine proton signal of the monomer
shifted from one peak at 8.7 ppm to a broad resonance with multiple
peaks between 8.0 and 8.3 ppm because of peptide formation. Second,
the α-CH methane proton of the monomer shifted downfield from
4.3 to 4.6 ppm. The β-CH2 also moved upfield from
3.0 to 2.5–2.8 ppm. The change of signal integration intensities
between the monomer and peptide is also consistent with peptide formation.
In the monomer spectrum, peak D (α-CH) and A (ethyl ester CH3) have an integration ratio of exactly 1:6, while in the oligomer
product spectrum, this ratio changed to 1:3.8 because of the loss
of ethyl ester groups during peptide bond formation. The oligomer
peaks are assigned as follows, δ = 1.17 (t, 3H, CH3 of Et), δ = 2.5–2.8
(m, 2H, β-CH2), δ = 3.54 (m, 1H, CH end group, see the Supporting Information), δ = 4.05 (q, 2H, CH2 of Et), δ = 4.56 (m, 1H, α-CH), and δ = 8.0–8.3 (m, 1H, NH).

Figure 2 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) spectra of (A) the monomer (Et2-Asp) and (B) oligo(Et-Asp) synthesized using 0.3 M Et2-Asp, 2 mg/mL α-chymotrypsin, and 0.6 M phosphate buffer (pH
8.5), at 40 °C, for 15 min. The peptide structure is shown as
α-linked, this will be discussed below.

The DPavg of oligo(Et-Asp) from the
40 °C 15 min reaction (see Figure 2 legend) was determined by 1H NMR peak integration
of methine protons D at 4.56 ppm relative to methine proton F at 3.54
ppm (the internal and end group methine hydrogens, respectively) is
11.1 (Mn 1600 g/mol). The same peptide
product was analyzed by MALDI-TOF and the spectrum is displayed in Figure 3. The adjacent series
of peaks differ by 143 m/z, which
corresponds to the molecular weight of an aspartic acid ethyl ester
residue in the peptide chain. MALDI-TOF peaks (sodium adducts) corresponding
to the oligopeptide range from DP 7 to DP 34, although the most intense
peaks range from DP 8 to 13, consistent with the NMR-determined DPavg. The MALDI-TOF spectrum indicates that the oligo(Et-Asp)
synthesized by α-chymotrypsin is a mixture of various DP oligomers.
One of the peak series, expanded for clarity, shows the major peak
and minor peaks. The higher signal at m/z = 1928.165 corresponds to oligo(Et-Asp) of DP = 13 with no loss
of ethyl ester groups. The two signals at m/z = 1900.166 and 1922.139 correspond to peptides where hydrolysis
of one ethyl ester pendant or the chain end group occurred, forming
the corresponding carboxylic acid and salt forms, respectively.

of oligo(Et-Asp) synthesized using 0.3 M Et2-Asp, 2 mg/mL
α-chymotrypsin, and 0.6 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.5), at 40 °C,
for 15 min.

Et2-Asp molecules have two ethyl ester
groups attached to the α- and β-carbonyls, respectively.
During the enzymatic reaction, either ester group can undergo nucleophilic
attack by the active site serine (Ser-195) to form an acyl–enzyme
complex. This could lead to two possibilities, formation of α-linked
oligoaspartate, oligo(β-Et-α-Asp), or β-linked oligoaspartate,
oligo(α-Et-β-Asp). If both α- and β-linkages
exist in oligoaspartate, two α-methine proton signals (D) with
different chemical shifts will be observed. A major α-proton
signal at ∼4.5 ppm and a minor peak at ∼4.4 ppm are
observed (Figure 2).
From the COSY spectrum shown in Figure S1, no cross-peaks are observed for the signal at 4.4, although this
may be due to its low intensity. The ratio of intensities between
signals at 4.5 and 4.4 is about 25:1.

To determine whether oligoaspartate
ethyl ester synthesized by α-chymotrypsin-catalysis is α-
or β-linked, the effects of TFA titration on 1D 1H NMR spectra and CD measurements were studied. Poly(β-Et-α-l-Asp) adopts a right-handed α-helix conformation in chloroform
and undergoes a helix–coil transition upon addition of TFA.58−60Figure 4A shows that
the α-H (D) shifts downfield as TFA (0.3–10%) was added
to the oligoaspartate/CDCl3 solution. This downfield shift
is consistent with that observed for the helix–coil transition
of poly(α-l-amino acids).60−62 The α-H
in poly(α-Et-β-l-Asp) undergoes an upfield shift
thus following the opposite trend under the same experimental conditions.
The formation of α-linked polyaspartate ethyl ester was further
confirmed by a CD spectrum conducted in pure chloroform (Figure 4b). A trough at 230
nm is observed in the CD spectrum at molar ellipticity of −5500,
which is consistent with the result observed for poly(β-Et-α-l-Asp) in previous publications.58−60

changes in oligo(Et-Asp): (A) α-H signal (D) shifts in the presence
of 0.3–10% TFA (v/v) in CDCl3; (B) CD spectrum in
chloroform.

Because of the overlap of the two carbonyl groups
(CO ester and CO amide) in the 13C NMR, direct assignment
of the linkage chemistry by 2D-1H13C HMBC, as
previously reported,62 was not possible.
To obtain direct evidence for the linkage chemistry of oligo(β-Et-α-l-Asp) synthesized by α-chymotrypsin catalysis, the reduction
of ester functionalities using LiAlH4 was performed to
obtain the corresponding peptide with hydroxyl side chains. Analysis
of the 2D-1H,1H COSY spectrum as shown in Figure S3 reveals a strong cross-peak between
the β-CH2 protons at ∼1.90 ppm and the methylene
protons of CH2OH at ∼3.70 ppm. This provides unambiguous
and direct evidence that the peptide is α-linked.

Influence of Reaction Parameters on α-Chymotrypsin Catalysis
of l-Aspartate Diethyl Ester (Et2-Asp)
A series of studies were performed to assess how the selected reaction
parameters (pH and concentrations of the buffer, monomer, and protease)
influence the yield and DPavg of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed
Et2-Asp oligomerizations. Figure S4 displays the results of how the reaction medium pH influences peptide
formation (see Figure S4 legend for reaction
conditions). Control of pH was achieved by using an automated pH-stat.
To quench the reaction at 5 min, concentrated HCl was added that reduces
the pH to 2–3. High enzyme activity was maintained between
pH 7.0 and 8.5 with yields that varied from 51 to 60%. A decrease
in the pH to 6.5 and an increase in the pH to 9.0 resulted in significant
decreases in yield (34 and 44%, respectively). Oligopeptide DPavg tends toward increasing values (∼10–14) as
the medium pH increases. There is a significant difference between
the DPavg’s of peptides formed at pH 7.5 and 9.5
(12 and 14.5, respectively). It may be that under alkaline pH conditions,
the extent of ester hydrolysis increases thereby increasing oligo(Et-Asp)
solubility that enables continued chain growth prior to precipitation.

Figure 5 displays
the strong influence of Et2-Asp concentration on product
formation. Oligo(Et-Asp) yield increased from 8 to 33 and 50% by increasing
the monomer concentration from 0.1 to 0.2 and 0.3 M, respectively.
A small increase from 0.15 to 0.2 M Et2-Asp resulted in
a 21% increase in product yield. Hence, a relatively low substrate
concentration is sufficient to enable kinetic control of product formation
as aminolysis is favored over hydrolysis reactions. A small increase
in the product yield from 50 to 58% occurred over the relatively large
substrate concentration range of 0.3–0.5 M. An increase in
the substrate concentration above 0.5 M resulted in substantial decreases
(33% from 0.5 to 0.8 M) in yield. We hypothesize that the increased
reaction time is required to reach higher yields as the substrate
concentration is increased. However, experiments to test this hypothesis
were not performed. Figure 5 also shows that there is no significant change in DPavg for substrate concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 M. Because
the data at higher concentrations were from one measurement, the resulting
absence of standard deviation data does not allow further discussion
of DPavg in the 0.6 to 0.8 M region of the plot.

Figure 5 Effect of substrate
concentration on oligo(Et-Asp) yield and DPavg. Reactions
were conducted using 2 mg/mL α-chymotrypsin, 0.6 M phosphate
buffer, at 40 °C, for 5 min at pH 8. Values are the mean from
triplicate experiments. Error bars define the standard deviation.

Figure 6 provides data on how reaction protease concentration effects
the yield and DPavg of α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed oligo(Et-Asp)
synthesis. Details of reaction conditions are given in the Figure 6 legend. As discussed
above, the catalytic activity of α-chymotrypsin is 5.68 units
mg–1 mL–1. The experiments described
in Figures 1, 5, and S4, S5 used 2 mg/mL
α-chymotrypsin or 11.36 units/mL. The product yield increased
from 27 to 40 and 58% with protease concentrations of 0.5, 1, and
2 mg/mL. Further increase in protease concentration from 2 to 3 and
4 mg/mL did not significantly change the product yield. However, increasing
the α-chymotrypsin concentration from 4 to 5 mg/mL decreased
the yield from 57 to 39%. Furthermore, dramatic decreases in DPavg of oligo(Et-Asp) occur with increased protease concentration.
For example, at 2 and 5 mg/mL α-chymotrypsin, the DPavg decreases from 12.5 to 6.9. Thus, both oligopeptide yield and DPavg decrease with increased protease and constant (0.5 M) monomer
concentration. This is explained by referring to Figure 1 where, at 40 °C, the
yield of oligo(Et-Asp) is 28 and 58% at 30 s and 5 min, respectively.
Further increase in the reaction time to 15 and 30 min resulted in
a decrease in % yield to 40.5 and 34.0%, respectively. Increase in
enzyme concentration is expected to accelerate the rate at which the
oligopeptide is formed and subsequently degraded. In other words,
we hypothesize that at enzyme concentrations >2.0 mg/mL, the peak
yield and degradation moves to shorter times resulting in peptide
degradation being the dominant reaction considerably before 5 min.
This hypothesis remains to be tested in future studies.

Figure 6 Effect of protease
concentration on oligo(β-Et-α-Asp) ester yield and DPavg. Reactions were conducted using 0.5 M l-aspartic
acid diethyl ester (Et2-l-Asp) hydrochloride salt,
0.6 M phosphate buffer, at 40 °C, for 5 min at pH 8. Values are
the mean from triplicate experiments. Error bars define the standard
deviation.

Figure S5 provides data
on the relationship between buffer concentration and oligo(Et-Asp)
yield and DPavg. After attaining a certain molecular weight,
oligo(Et-Asp) precipitates from solution. By increasing the phosphate
buffer concentration, the yield might increase because of “salting
out” of the product. The highest yield is at 0.6 M buffer solution.
Further increase of buffer concentration resulted in decreased yield,
probably because of the negative impact of the high ionic strength
on the ionic states of protease active site residues. The peptide
yield remained at about 40% at buffer concentrations above 0.9 M.
A large decrease in the DPavg occurs at buffer concentrations
above 0.9 M. This is explained by the decreased solubility of oligo(Et-Asp)
at high buffer concentrations that results in product precipitation
at relatively lower average chain lengths.

Computational Modeling
To understand the molecular
basis of the observed protease selectivity for oligomerizations of
Et2-Glu and Et2-Asp in the L-stereochemical
configuration, computational modeling was performed using Rosetta
software. Simulations were used to determine the relative energies
of Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu monomer–substrate
binding to papain and α-chymotrypsin active sites in which the
respective enzyme–acyl complexes of aspartate and glutamate
monoethyl esters had been formed.

In this set of computational
models, two pairs of models were constructed for the diethyl esters
in the program Avogadro. The first pair with the α-ester hydrolyzed
(α-AME for aspartic acid monoethyl ester and α-GME for
glutamic acid monoethyl ester) and the second pair of monoethyl esters
with the β-ester of Et2-Asp hydrolyzed (β-AME)
and the γ-ester of Et2-Glu hydrolyzed (γ-GME).
These were then modeled into the active site to generate the respective
acyl–enzyme intermediates. The (attacking nucleophile) diethyl
ester monomers Et2-Asp and Et2-Glu were also
generated using Avogadro.

α-Chymotrypsin Models
In the reactive substrate-bound
α-chymotrypsin models, a pocket near S195 (nucleophilic residue
in the enzyme) fits each modeled substrate (Figure 7). In modeling the amine nucleophile into
the catalytic site, the positioning and conformational preference
of the ester gives insight into the preference for α-linkages
observed in experiments. For the Et2-Asp nucleophile, there
are two conformers of Et2-Asp observed, depending on the
acylation position (α or β) (Figure 7A,B, respectively). Both conformers orient
the amine group into a position optimal for attack on the carbonyl
carbon while being activated by the H57 imidazole. However, for the
β-AME-chymotrypsin models, intramolecular or intermolecular
steric hindrances are observed for the Et2-Asp nucleophile.
In contrast, the α-AME-α-chymotrypsin models lack these
Et2-Asp clashes (Table S1),
which may explain the preferential formation of oligo(β-Et-α-Asp)
instead of oligo(β-Et-β-Asp).

Figure 7 α-Chymotrypsin
active site-docking models: Et2-Asp (green) forming an
α-chymotrypsin (blue) acyl intermediate with (A) α-hydrolyzed
aspartic acid (pink) and (B) β-hydrolyzed aspartic acid (red).
Et2-Glu (orange) forms acyl intermediates with (C) α-chymotrypsin-α-hydrolyzed
glutamic acid (teal) and (D) α-chymotrypsin-γ-glutamic
acid (purple). Both α-hydrolyzed species demonstrate ester burial
in the active site pocket with relaxed conformations and hydrogen
bonding interactions between the α-hydrolyzed amine and the
carboxylate oxygen.

For the α-GME-α-chymotrypsin acyl intermediate
with Et2-Glu, conformations of the nucleophile and the
hydrolyzed ester exhibit clashes with α-chymotrypsin (Figure 7C,D). For Et2-Glu to adopt a catalytically active orientation, unfavorable
interactions of the Et2-Glu carbonyl oxygens (distance
< 3.0 Å) with either the carbonyl oxygen of H57 or the carbonyl
oxygen of F38 occur. The γ-hydrolyzed models (Figure 7D) are even more unfavorable
as the Et2-Glu conformation has additional carbonyl oxygen
interactions with S39, and the interaction between the F38 carbonyl
oxygen and the Et2-Glu α carbonyl oxygen approaches
2.6 Å. Thus, conformational changes, which in turn may reduce
the catalytic efficiency, may be required for polymerization. These
observations are consistent with the reduced amount of the product
obtained in the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed Et2-Glu
oligomerization reaction (Table 1).

Papain Models
In the case of papain catalysis, models
of Et2-Glu attacking the α-GME acyl intermediate
(Figure 8C) reveal
that Et2-Glu is in an energetically favorable conformational
state with the Et2-Glu amine in an optimal orientation
and distance for attack. That is, in the simulations conducted, no
steric hindrance was observed. In the γ-GME acyl intermediate
models (Figure 8D),
both Et2-Glu and γ-GME have energetically unfavorable
conformational states with inter- and intramolecular clashes between
the diethylester and the hydrolyzed intermediate.

Figure 8 Papain active site-docking
models: Et2-Asp (green) forming a papain (wheat) acyl intermediate
with (A) α-hydrolyzed aspartic acid (pink) and (B) β-hydrolyzed
aspartic acid (red), both demonstrating intramolecular steric clashes
which inhibit catalysis. Contrarily, the (C) papain-α-hydrolyzed
glutamic acid (teal) acyl intermediate with Et2-Glu (orange)
substrates are in relaxed conformations, while the (D) papain-γ-glutamic
acid (purple) acyl intermediate illustrates two intramolecular steric
clashes.

For α-AME-acyl-papain intermediate models
(Figure 8A), the orientation
of the Et2-Asp amine is unfavorable for the formation of
an amide bond in both conformations. Conformations adopted by Et2-Asp exhibit intramolecular steric clashes between the carbonyl
oxygens in both conformations. In the β-hydrolyzed aspartic
acid set of acyl intermediate models (Figure 8B), conformations of the Et2-Asp
amine required for the effective nucleophilic attack at the β-AME-acyl
intermediate are highly strained. These models are consistent with
the observation that papain is unable to oligomerize Et2-Asp (Table 1).

The abovementioned observations of molecular sterics being consistent
with experimental observations are also reflected in energies of docked
molecules calculated from Rosetta (Table S1). In Rosetta modeling, the “total score” represents
the overall energy of a specific protease–substrate model and
the “constraint score” is a reflection of how favorable
the catalytic geometry of a given model is. The ideal catalytic geometry
is defined based on mechanistic studies. In both cases, a lower score
is more favorable. The models demonstrate that total scores in all
cases are similar (for a given enzyme) and constraints score (penalty),
describing the fit of the model to a catalytically competent conformational
state, agree well with experimental data (Table S1). Specifically, α-chymotrypsin has higher oligomerization
yields for Et2-Asp relative to Et2-Glu, and
the α-chymotrypsin models correspondingly have lower constraint
scores in the aspartic acid acyl intermediates over the glutamic acid
acyl intermediates. In papain models, the Et2-Glu models
have better constraint scores than the Et2-Asp models,
corresponding to papain’s ability to preferentially polymerize
diethyl esters of glutamic acid but not aspartic acid.

To further
investigate the positional preference for polymerization, we calculated
energies of the acyl–enzyme moiety linked to the enzyme at
different positions (α, β, and γ) and found that
Rosetta’s fa_intra_rep score term, the term describing the
Lennard-Jones repulsive energy between atoms within the same molecule
(lower is more favorable), correlates well with α-chymotrypsin’s
and papain’s preferred mode of polymerization at the α-position
(Table S2). The fa_intra_rep score term
is calculated by summing over the repulsive interactions between all
atoms in the molecule. These values allow us to compare the relative
strain in different molecules and different conformers of the monomer.
However, as the values are not absolute energies, they are meaningful
only in comparison with each other. Thus, the experimentally observed
preferences of the enzymes for Et2-Asp relative to Et2-Glu polymerization can be qualitatively recapitulated using
Rosetta modeling. The hydrolytic cleavage of amide/peptide bonds by
proteases is mechanistically well-understood and has been investigated
extensively by computational approaches.63−65 However, little
attention has been paid to computationally investigating the underlying
basis for substrate specificity in the peptide bond formation reaction
catalyzed by proteases. Previous modeling efforts on papain-catalyzed
dipeptide synthesis focused on the choice of the ester group or on
rationalizing the l-amino acid versus d-amino acid
preference (47, 66). Our results
show that consideration of the energetics of interaction between the
acylated enzyme and the amino acid nucleophile is also necessary to
better recapitulate the substrate preference of protease enzymes in
peptide synthesis. The qualitative agreement of Rosetta-calculated
energetics with experimental observations of substrate specificity
in peptide synthesis also indicates that a Rosetta-based approach
should be applicable for the redesign of proteases for peptide synthesis
which would require remodeling of both the S1 (acyl donor-binding)
and S1’ (amine-binding) pockets on the protease to control
specificity.

Conclusions
Four proteases were selected to assess
their relative activities for oligomerization of Et2-Asp
and Et2-Glu that differ by just one methylene unit between
their α-carbon and corresponding β- and γ-carboxylate
functionalities, respectively. This comparative study revealed that
papain and α-chymotrypsin have remarkably different oligomerization
activities for these similar substrates. Papain-catalyzed oligomerization
of Et2-Glu and Et2-Asp gave yields of 60 and
0%, respectively. Computational modeling proved consistent with these
results because Et2-Glu forms energetically favorable conformational
states for the reaction with the papain-α-linked to γ-ethyl
glutamate monoester (the acyl–enzyme complex). In contrast,
when Et2-Asp is the incoming nucleophile attacking the
acyl–enzyme complex (papain-α-linked to β-ethyl
aspartate), computational modeling shows that conformations required
for amide bond formation are highly strained. Because α-chymotrypsin
proved to be most effective for Et2-Asp oligomerization,
studies were performed to characterize the linkage chemistry (i.e.,
α- vs β) of oligo(Et-Asp). Titration of an oligo(Et-Asp)
chloroform solution with TFA results in a downfield shift of the methine
hydrogen with increasing TFA concentration, consistent with the fact
that oligo(Et-Asp) is α-linked. This result is consistent with
the CD spectrum where a trough at 230 nm was observed. Because NMR
assignment of linkage chemistry proved inconclusive because of overlapping
peaks, the ester side chains were reduced to hydroxyl moieties. NMR
experiments on this product show unambiguously that aspartate units
are connected by α-linked peptide bonds.

α-Chymotrypsin
catalyzed oligomerization at 40 °C occurred rapidly such that
in 30 s and 5 min, % yields reached ∼25 and 58%, respectively.
A small increase in monomer (Et2-Asp) concentration from
0.15 to 0.2 M resulted in a 21% increase in the product yield demonstrating
that a relatively low substrate concentration is sufficient to enable
kinetically driven aminolysis reactions that build peptide chains.
An α-chymotrypsin concentration of 2 mg/mL (0.5 M substrate)
gave a 58% yield with a DPavg of 12. Finally, computational
modeling of α-chymotrypsin led to lower energy structures that
favor formation of α-linkages and a preference for oligomerization
of aspartate over glutamate diethyl ester.

Although papain can
have broad specificity for oligomerization of different amino acid
ethyl esters such as phenyl alanine, leucine, alanine, and tyrosine,
papain has high selectivity that discriminates between aspartate and
glutamate diethyl esters. α-Chymotrypsin-catalyzed oligomerization
of Et2-Asp occurs rapidly giving DPavg values
between 12 and 14 (Mn values of 1762–2048).
Such chain lengths, based on prior work with thermal polyaspartate,
have proven useful as antiscalants for water processing and also hold
promise as building blocks to construct block copolymers for drug
delivery and hydrogel formation.
