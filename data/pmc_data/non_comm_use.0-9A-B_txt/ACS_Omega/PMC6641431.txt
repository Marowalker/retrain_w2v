Low-cost,
stable, highly sensitive, and easy-to-equip fluorescent
high-pressure sensors are always attractive in both industrial and
scientific communities. Organic emitting materials with pressure-dependent
bathochromisms usually exhibit prominent mechanoluminescence, due
to disturbance of intermolecular packing. This hinders their applications
in stable and robust pressure sensing. In this work, we have developed
a mechanically stable organic molecular pressure sensor, caused by
intramolecular consecutive rotations by pressure, which exhibit large
and eye-detectable emission bathochromism from yellow-green to red
fluorescence and can be used for 0–15 GPa pressure sensing.
The emission bathochromism shows good linear relationship with pressure,
exhibiting a high linear coefficient of 9.1 nm/GPa. Moreover, this
molecular sensor exhibits high thermal and mechanical stabilities,
indicating good potentials for robust and outdoor applications.

1 Introduction
High
pressure is essential in modern industry and scientific research,
such as the explosive evaluation of military weapons, geological/biological/deep-sea/outer
space research or exploration, ultraprecision manufacturing, investigation
of phase diagram/transition/structural revolution, study of thermodynamic/electric/magnetic/optical
behavior in extreme environment, and pressure-driven synthesis or
reaction (i.e., synthesis of artificial diamond).1 Therefore, real-time, accurate and rapid detection of high
pressure has become an important issue.

Pressure sensors are
generally designed on the basis of different
transduction mechanisms, including piezoresistivity,2 piezocapacitance,3 piezoelectricity,4 and piezotronic or piezo-optical effects.5 These devices exhibit superior performances but
mostly work in a limited detection range.4a,6 High-pressure
sensors, which can detect pressures beyond 500 MPa, are still quite
limited. To measure high pressure, the electric sensors require complicated
signal processing circuits and extra pressure overload protection.7 Optical sensors using diamond anvil cell (DAC)
can easily compress materials to high pressures up to several hundred
gigapascals and offer a noncontact way of remote, fast, and in situ
high-pressure monitoring under extreme conditions, by integration
of the pressure-sensitive DAC component with normal optical detecting
instruments.

The pressure can be determined by using fluorescence
wavelength
shift,8,9 Raman wavelength shift,1i,10 synchrotron X-ray diffractions signals,1d or luminescence lifetime.11 Using Raman
shift, fluorescence lifetime, or synchrotron X-ray signals of metals
provides accurate high-pressure detection but requires complicated
and expensive equipment. In comparison, luminescent sensors are cost
effective. However, the mostly used inorganic ruby sensors have defects
of peak broadening, overlap of the two lines of the doublet fluorescence,
as well as series crosstalk of pressure and temperature effects caused
by the shift of emission positions at elevating temperatures.9 The alternative SrB4O7/Sm2+ exhibits pressure-sensitive fluorescence shift with negligible
temperature dependence. Nevertheless, the mismatch of yield strength
and elastic property between the pressure sensor and the coexisting
sample remains a big problem.12 In addition,
for both sensors, the fluorescence shift with pressure is quite small
(within 10 nm when increasing to 30 GPa); thus, the sensitivity is
limited and the crosstalk, if there is, between pressure and other
factors (i.e., thermo) cannot be ignored. Moreover, these inorganic
materials are expensive and intrinsically brittle, which cannot be
used for cheap and flexible applications.13 Therefore, low-cost, sensitive, and reliable optical high-pressure
sensors are highly in demand.

Organic sensors are always regarded
as good potential alternatives
due to many advantages, such as low-cost preparation, good flexibility,
and large-area fabrication. In recent years, very few organic materials
have been reported to exhibit significant piezochromism, caused by
change of crystal structures (relating to different intermolecular
packing).14 However, these materials always
exhibit prominent mechanoluminescence properties under smashing or
grinding, due to the easy disturbance of weak noncovalent interactions
between molecules. Some of them even show significant emission color
change upon heating. Moreover, most of the organic fluorophores exhibit
significant emission quenching under high pressures. All of these
limitations hinder their applications for robust and stable pressure
sensing.

A few publications have demonstrated that some organic
compounds
show significant piezochromic behavior due to disturbance of the energy
level arrangements.14e,15 In our previous work, we found
that a few organic chromophores exhibit pressure-dependent spectra
caused by change in molecular configuration.16 Herein, on the basis of the mechanism of pressure-induced intramolecular
rotations, an organic molecular gauge exhibiting significant pressure-dependent
bathochromism with good mechanical and thermal stabilities has been
demonstrated. This molecular sensor shows eye-detectable yellow-green
to red luminescence color change over a wide pressure range from 0
to 15 GPa, suggesting good potentials for low-cost, easily prepared,
and reliable pressure sensing.

2 Results and Discussion
The DAAD compound has been prepared by Knoevenagel condensation
of [9,9′-bianthracene]-10,10′-dicarbaldehyde and malononitrile
under the catalysis of weak alkali (Scheme 1).17 The molecular
structures and purities are confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and mass spectroscopy (see the synthesis details
and full molecular characterizations in the Experimental
Section). DAAD shows almost identical absorption profiles in
polar and nonpolar solvents, with the maximum absorption peaks at
440 nm. However, the emission maximum varies significantly with solvent
polarity (Figure 1a),
characteristics of charge transfer property. To investigate the pressure-dependent
spectroscopic change of DAAD, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was
used as the molecularly dispersed polymer matrix. Under ambient pressure,
the maximum absorption of the film peaks at 445 nm, similar to those
in solutions. The emission maximum of the doped film is 569 nm, which
is similar to that in ethyl acetate solvent (Figure 1b), indicating a moderate solid–solvent
polarity.

Figure 1 (a) Normalized absorption and emission spectra of DAAD in solutions
(1.0 × 10–5 mol/L, λex = 420
nm) and (b) in film (0.5 wt % dispersed in PMMA matrix).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes of DAAD
Although the yellow-green emission of the film is weak,
exhibiting
a low photoluminescence quantum yield of 2%, it can be abnormally
enhanced when gradually increasing the applied static pressure (Figure 2a). At 0.44 GPa,
the fluorescence intensity significantly increased by almost 5 times.
When the applied pressure increases to 5.08 GPa, the photoluminescence
quantum efficiency reaches a maximum value of 32%, with the total
fluorescence intensity increased by 16 times. During this emission-increasing
process, the emission spectra clearly show a gradual red shift with
the emission maximum from 563 nm at 0 GPa to 620 nm at 5.08 GPa. On
further increasing the applied pressure, the emission bathochromism
keeps on while the emission intensity begins to drop. As the applied
pressure increases from 5.08 to 14.78 GPa, the emission maximum gradually
shifts from 620 to 704 nm with the fluorescence intensity progressively
decreased by 15 times (Figure 2b). To the best of our knowledge, the overall detected pressure-dependent
large bathochromism (141 nm) from yellow-green (563 nm) to red (704
nm) emission is the largest piezochromic shift of organic materials
reported to date.18 More importantly, after
the pressure is released, the emission maximum wavelength can return
back to its original location (Figure S1). The spectrum at the reverse 0 GPa (r0 GPa) corresponds to the
emission maximum of 565 nm, which is quite similar to that at 0 GPa
(563 nm) before the pressure-increasing process. This indicates almost
no hysteresis and potentially frequent application of the sensor.
Using polystyrene (PS) as the polymer matrix, the pressure-dependent
emission spectra exhibit a similar change tendency (Figure S2).

Figure 2 Pressure-dependent fluorescence spectra of DAAD film (0.5
wt %
dispersed in the PMMA matrix): (a) emission-increasing process and
(b) emission-decreasing process.

The pressure-dependent X-ray diffraction patterns indicate
that
the DAAD powder remains in the amorphous state with increase of applied
pressure (Figure S3). Thus, the pressure-induced
emission shift should not originate from change of crystalline structure.
The intramolecular mechanism is more reasonable. To gain an indepth
insight into the pressure effect on the photophysical properties,
we carried out theoretical calculations on the DAAD molecule. The
molecular geometries of the ground state (S0) and the first
singlet excited state (S1) were optimized by density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level,
respectively. The two anthracene moieties at the fully optimized S0 and S1 geometries are both nearly perpendicular,
with the dihedral angles (θ1) of 90.4 and 91.8°,
respectively (Figure 3). This dihedral angle is much larger than those between the anthracene
units and the bis(cyano)-substituted vinyl groups (θ2), which are the same for S0 (54.1°) but different
for S1 (37.7 and 56.0°). The diagram of the dihedral
angles of θ1 and θ2 in the molecular
structure is depicted in Figure 4a.

Figure 3 Fully optimized molecular geometries of S0 and
S1 by DFT and TDDFT at the B3LYP/6-31G** level.

emission wavelengths
and oscillator strengths of the S1 state optimized at different
dihedral angles of θ1 and θ2 (black:
only θ1 is fixed at different angles; blue: θ2 decreases from the optimal angle of 48.1–0° with
θ1 kept at 50°). (c) Relative potential energies
of the ground state optimized at different dihedral angles of θ1 and θ2 (black: only θ1 is
fixed at different angles; blue: θ2 decreases from
the optimal angle of 55.4 to 0° with θ1 kept
at 50°). (d) Evolution of the S1 and T1 excitation energies at the optimized S1 state as a function
of the dihedral angle θ2 when the dihedral angle
θ1 is fixed at 50°.

When θ1 decreases from 90 to 50°, the
oscillator
strength for the S1 → S0 transition increases
sharply (Figure 4b),
which is well consistent with the experimental observation of the
initial emission enhancement until the applied pressure reaches 5.08
GPa (Figure 2a). However,
in contrast to the subsequent decrease of emission under higher pressure
(Figure 2b), the oscillator
strength continues to slowly increase if θ1 decreases
from 50 to 0°. On the contrary, our calculations indicate that
when θ1 is 50°, the optimized θ2 is ca. 48° and, interestingly, when θ2 is
reduced from 48° with θ1 kept at 50°, the
S1 → S0 oscillator strength decreases
by 2 times (Figure 4b). Moreover, the potential energy surface scan shows that the molecule
is more stable by decreasing θ2 (with θ1 fixed at 50°) than by continuously decreasing θ1 (<50°) (Figure 4c). That is, exerting pressure of more than 5.08 GPa
will result in the decrease of θ2 rather than that
of θ1. However, this is still inadequately responsible
for the 15-fold decrease in the experimental fluorescence intensity
when the applied pressure increases from 5.08 to 14.78 GPa. To understand
the large emission decrease, we further calculated the first triplet
excited state (T1) as a function of θ2 with θ1 fixed at 50° (Figure 4d). When θ2 is less than
15°, the excitation energy of S1 is found to become
higher than twice the T1 excitation energy. Thus, a possible
explanation is that singlet fission (SF), referring to a multiple
exciton generation process that one photoexcited high-energy singlet
exciton is converted into a pair of low-energy triplet excitons,19 can occur under higher pressure. This SF process
can mainly account for the dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity
under high pressures of 5.08–14.78 GPa.20 Similar trends in oscillator strength, potential energy
surface, and singlet–triplet energy alignment with θ2 are found when fixing θ1 at 60° (Figure S4). To conclude, as the pressure increases,
the torsion between the two anthracene rings will first be reduced,
leading to gradually enhanced and bathochromic emission. Then, the
torsion between the anthracene ring and bis(cyano)-substituted vinyl
group will become smaller, leading to continuous red-shift emission
and subsequent emission quenching due to the combinatorial effects
of enhanced singlet fission and decreased oscillator strength.

On the basis of the large pressure-dependent bathochromism, it
is expected to establish a precise sensing of pressure. The curve
based on the change of maximum emission wavelength with pressure was
calibrated, which shows a good linear relationship fitted as a function
of P = 0.11Δλmax –
1.53 with correlation coefficient 0.9970 (Figure 5a). Here, λmax is the maximum
emission wavelength (nm) and P is the applied pressure
(GPa). The slope of the calibration curve provides a pressure sensitivity
of dP/dλmax = 0.11 GPa/nm. The linear P coefficient is estimated to be 9.1 nm/GPa, which is more
than 25 and 36 times higher than that of ruby (Al2O3/Cr3+)- and SrB4O7/Sm2+-based fluorescent sensors, respectively (see Table 1).21 It should be noted that the deviation of the fitted line from the
zero point is mainly caused by the mismatch between the yield strength
and the elastic property of the ruby and that of the PMMA polymer
film.22 If the ruby is much harder than
the sample, the determined pressure would be higher than the actual
value due to stress concentration or pressure intensification.23 On increasing the pressure, the emission color
shifts gradually from yellow-green to red (Figure 5b), which agrees well with the pressure-dependent
emission spectra. Under ambient pressure, it gives a faint yellow-green
emission. With pressure increasing from 0.35 to 1.4 GPa, the film
emission shifts to yellow with gradual enhancement in emission intensity.
Then, the emission becomes orange at 1.99–3.30 GPa and orange-red
at 4.18–5.08 GPa with continuously increasing intensity. When
increasing the pressure to higher than 6.22 GPa, the emission color
turns red and finally to deep red with the emission intensity gradually
decreasing.

More importantly,
this film is thermally and mechanically stable
and is chemically resistant to corrosive media due to protection of
the PMMA matrix. With increase in the ambient temperature to 473 K,
the emission maximum shows almost no shift, with the emission intensity
still remaining 75% of that at room temperature (Figure 6a). Moreover, the emission
color of the pressure-sensitive film did not change under scratching
or violent hammering (Figure 6b). Considering the regulatory restriction of the heating
accessory system, the applicable range can be extended to higher temperatures.
The eye-detectable large bathochromism, high linear P coefficient, high mechanical resistance, and wide applicable temperature
range indicate great potentials for facile and robust outdoor applications,
such as portable devices, geological exploration, and fieldwork, as
well as harsh-environment pressure sensing by integration with optical
fiber-based techniques.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a naked-eye organic luminescent high-pressure sensor
with large bathochromism has been developed on the basis of specific
molecular dual-rotators via consecutive intramolecular conformational
planarization. When the central large dihedral angle of the molecule
was pressed smaller to some extent, the side dihedral angle then began
to be pressed. This pressure sensor can be applied in high pressure
range up to 15 GPa, with a high linear P coefficient
of 9.1 nm/GPa. Significant emission color change, high mechanical
and thermal stabilities, as well as good film-forming abilities make
it suitable for eye-detectable rough pressure sensing and facile outdoor
applications. Moreover, the large emission chromism at single molecular
level is prospective for future high-resolution spatial pressure sensing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Film Preparation
Zinc
power and 1,1-dichlorodimethyl ether were purchased from Energy Chemical.
Zinc chloride was purchased from aladdin. Poly(methyl methacrylate)
and polystyrene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 9,9-Bianthracene
was obtained through an addition reaction of 9-anthrone to a suspension
of Zn powder and ZnCl2, according to the previously published
literature.ref24 PMMA (medium molecular
weight of 400 000) was purchased from Aldrich and used after
reprecipitation. Spectral-grade chloroform was used as solvent to
dissolve the DAAD compounds and PMMA. To prepare films, PMMA and DAAD
were dissolved in chloroform and the solution was poured into a glass
dish to form a uniform film after solvent evaporation at room temperature.
The film was then placed in a vacuum oven for a few days at 45 °C.
Transparent blended film with a low concentration (0.5 wt %) of dispersed
DAAD was obtained and was optically clear without phase separation.

4.2 Instrumental Methods
The NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Mass spectra
were collected using a Microflex matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics,
Germany). UV–vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded on
Hitachi UV-3010 and Hitachi F-7000 spectrometers, respectively. The
film fluorescence quantum yields were measured using an Edinburgh
FLSP920 spectrometer with an integration sphere. A Merrill–Bassett
diamond anvil cell (DAC) was used to generate high pressure. The hole
diameter of the gasket holding the sample was about 300 μm,
with a thickness of about 90 μm. A small chip of ruby was placed
in the hole to calibrate the pressure by measuring its fluorescence
red shift. Light mineral oil served as a pressure medium. The DAC
containing the sample was placed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope
to focus the laser onto the sample. Emission spectra were obtained
from an Ocean Optics HR4000 spectrometer by using a monochromator
equipped with a photomultiplier. The maximum emission wavelength is
determined by the numerical maximum.
