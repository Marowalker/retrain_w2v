The
present report employed nanobroom (NB)-shaped two-dimensional
molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) for the preparation of a
sensing matrix for the detection of Salmonella paratyphi. An aptamer specific to salmonella was immobilized onto MoSe2NB-modified fluorine-doped tin oxide via glutaraldehyde cross-linking.
Structural and morphological characterizations were performed using
UV–vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques.
Characterizations confirmed the nanobroom morphology and nanosize
of the MoSe2 material. Electrochemical studies revealed
a good linear detection range of 10–2–10–10 CFU/mL with low detection limit of 1 × 10–10 CFU/mL and with R2 =
0.98. The developed preferable nanobroom-shaped sensing matrix can
provide a promising platform for rapid and accurate detection of Salmonella
in real samples due to its tremendous stability and sensitivity.

Introduction
Food contamination is the major problem
that is posing a serious
threat to the public health. Recent outbreaks trigger the public health
domain for an upgrading in diagnosis and treatment methods. Among
various food-borne pathogens, Salmonella is a major threat to the
health.1,2 There are various serovars of Salmonella,
and among them, the antibiotic-resistant species Salmonella
enterica serovar paratyphi A (S. paratyphi A) is the causative agent of paratyphoid A fever.3,4 Food
products contain different essential nutrients, which provide a compatible
environment for the growth of Salmonella.1

There are various traditional techniques for the detection
of Salmonella
such as classical culture and enrichment methods, but these methods
have some setbacks such as being lengthy, requiring expertize, and
being cumbersome.5 Molecular and immunological
techniques also have some associated drawbacks such as cross-reactivity
and use of expensive reagents.6,7 There is need for the
development of a detection system, which overcomes all of the disadvantages
associated with the earlier methods. The electrochemical technique
is the best alternative technique for overcoming all of the disadvantages
linked with the conventional methods.8 Furthermore,
in this approach, an aptamer was also used as a biological recognition
element, which can directly bind to Salmonella and produce a change
in the electrochemical signal. Aptamers are long stretches of DNA
or RNA, which have the ability to bind with the specific protein or
antigen by forming unique structural forms.9 Aptamers are the choice of researchers because of their attractive
features such as lack of cross-reactivity, small size, ease of preparation,
cost-effectiveness, and high specificity.10,11 Various aptamer-based sensors are developed, which satisfy all of
the requirements of a diagnostic device.12−16 The aforementioned aptasensor employed a glassy carbon
electrode (GCE), which is relatively expensive and for which the cleaning
process is also difficult,14 but the present
approach involves the use of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode,
which has distinct features such as cost-effectiveness, high capacitive
behavior, facile cleaning, conductive behavior, and large surface
area. Nanomaterials play a pivotal role in the fabrication of a biosensor
due to their many advantageous intrinsic factors, which make them
an ideal candidate for immobilization of biological molecules.17−19 Nowadays, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are fascinating researchers
owing to their characteristic features such as high surface area,
increased electron transfer kinetics, and stability.20,21 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained a lot of attraction
due to its large surface area, but the material has poor conductivity.22 Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) has
good electrical conductivity due to the Se that makes the material
even more suitable for biosensing applications.23 Furthermore, the nanobroom-shaped platform provides a compatible
environment to the biological recognition element, which ultimately
leads to its increased stability and sensitivity. Thus, aptamers and
MoSe2 NBs in combination made the best recognition layer
for Salmonella, which leads to a lower detection limit as compared
to that of earlier reported aptasensors.13,14,24 The present approach involves the development
of a MoSe2-modified aptasensor for the detection of S. paratyphi. In the present study, FTO was modified
with MoSe2 for providing compatible ambience to the aptamer
and for promoting electron transfer kinetics. In addition, the −NH2-modified aptamer was immobilized through glutaraldehyde linkage,
which provided stability and longevity to the sensing platform. The
developed platform was employed for the detection of Salmonella bacteria
at different dilutions. The aptasensor was characterized using electrochemical
techniques, that is, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse
voltammetry (DPV) at each stage of fabrication. The developed sensor
showed excellent results in terms of linearity (10–2–10–10), detection limit (10–10), and specificity.

Results and Discussion
Morphological and Surface Characterizations
of MoSe2
Figure 1a shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of MoSe2 nanobrooms recorded in the range of 200–800 cm−1, which was in agreement with the earlier reports.25,26 The strong absorbance peak in the visible range from 550 to 800
nm was observed, which clearly indicated that the material has high
absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Figure 1b shows the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the MoSe2 nanomaterial. As evident
from the image, microrods of length ∼10 μm and diameter
∼150 nm were homogeneously distributed. Microrods were closely
packed at one end and spread out at the other end, which resulted
in the formation of a “conical” broom-shaped morphology
called “nanobrooms”. Figure 1c shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrum of MoSe2 recorded in the range of 400–4000
cm–1. Peaks were observed corresponding to Mo–OH
(3339 cm–1); (H–O–H) and COO–
(2264 cm–1); COO– (2053 cm–1); Se–O (1576 cm–1); O–Mo–O
(3572 cm–1); and Se–O–Se (864, 509,
and 428 cm–1). Figure 1d shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of
powdered MoSe2 depicting the crystal structure. The material
was found to be polycrystalline, and from JCPDS file no. 17-0744,
the material was confirmed as MoSe2. The peaks were not
sharp, which confirmed the amorphous nature of the material. Highest
peaks were observed at 14.084, 34.44, and 55.53° for the (002),
(012), and (110) planes, respectively.

Salmonella Plate Count
At the end of the incubation
period, five dilutions (10–2, 10–4, 10–6, 10–8, and 10–10) of Salmonella were chosen for the plate counting method. The number
of colonies forming unit (CFU) was calculated using the formula  At a higher dilution (10–10), growth of colonies is less, and at lower dilutions (10–2), more number of colonies are formed. According to the above formula,
the number of bacteria in the plate with a higher dilution (1 ×
10–2) was 2.5 × 10–4. Further
dilutions of the salmonella plate were calculated using the same formula
as reported in Table 1.

10–6	10.00	–8.00	
10–8	0.10	–10.00

Electrochemical Characterization
of Various Stages of Electrodes
Electrochemical characterization
was performed at different phases
of electrodes such as bare electrode, MoSe2NBs-modified
FTO electrode, aptamer/MoSe2NBs/FTO. Results depicted that
the bare electrode showed insignificant electrochemical response,
whereas the electrode modified with MoSe2NBs showed an
increase in sensing response. MoSe2NBs provide high surface
area, compatible ambience, and distinctive electron transport.27 After bioconjugation of the aptamer onto MoSe2, the electrochemical signal was decreased due to nonconductive
nature of the biological molecule and the repulsion, linking the negatively
charged aptamer sequence and [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– (Figure 2). After
incubation with salmonella, the current decreased dramatically due
to the nonconducting film of bacteria specifically bound to the aptamer.
All results confirmed the successful formation of different phases
of electrode.

Optimization of Experimental Variables
Various experimental
conditions such as aptamer concentration, incubation time, and temperature
were optimized to obtain the maximum sensing signal. Various concentrations
of the aptamer ranging from 20 to 40, 60, 80, and 100 μM were
immobilized to optimize the sensing signal. Results from the DPV curve
are depicted in Figure 3a, which shows that upon increasing the concentration of aptamers,
the current was decreased, which was due to the more insulating layer
of the biological recognition element onto the surface. The response
time was also measured by incubating the modified electrode at different
times. In Figure 3b,
the optimal response time was also measured by incubating the salmonella/aptamer/MoSe2/FTO at different times (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 s). DPV results
concluded that upon increasing the time of incubation with Salmonella
there was an increase in electrochemical response, which was due to
more interaction of salmonella with the aptamer. Current decreased
after 25 s because enough interaction of salmonella was already made
with the aptamer. Studies at different temperatures ranging from 4
to 25, 35, and 45 °C were performed to detect the effect of temperature
on the sensing response of the biosensor. DPV results as in Figure 3c proved that there
was an increase in the sensing response upto 35 °C. CV of aptamer/MoSe2/FTO was detailed at the scan rate from 10 to 100, and it
was observed that the peak current increased with the increasing scan
rate without any potential shift. The best scan rate was selected
to be 100 mV/s for subsequent studies, as shown in Figure 3d,e.

aptamer concentrations: (i) 20 μM,

rates was optimized ranging from 10 to 100 mV/s. (e) Linear plot of
current vs square root of scan rate from 10 to 100 mV/s. The buffer
used for all of the optimization studies was 0.1 M KCl with 5 mM [Fe(CN) 6]3–/4– solution.

Different concentrations of salmonella were exposed to the
modified
electrode for 2 h. After incubation, the modified electrode was analyzed
using DPV study. When the concentration of salmonella was increased,
more adsorption of salmonella occurred onto the electrode surface,
which ultimately hindered more electron transfer. DPV curves clearly
depicted in Figure 4a that there was a decrease in the current signal with the increase
in the concentrations of salmonella. The standard curve between the
log concentration of salmonella and current value is also shown in Figure 4b. According to the
data, we can note that as the concentration changed from 10–2 to 10–10 CFU/mL a good linear relationship could
be achieved. The equation for this relationship is y = 4.965 × 10–5x + 6.767
× 10–5, and R2 =
0.98. The detection limit was 10–10 CFU/mL.

of S. paratyphi.

Selectivity, Reproducibility, and Reliability
A control
experiment was also conducted under the same conditions, using aptamer/MoSe2/FTO with an Escherichia coli bacterial strain. After hybridization with the E.
coli bacterial strain, it showed a current almost
similar to or larger than that of aptamer/MoSe2/FTO. However,
when the sensor was exposed to Salmonella, the current was greatly
decreased. Measurements shown in Figure 5a proved that the present FTO was very specific
for S. paratyphi detection. To check
the repeatability of the proposed aptasensor, DPV of aptamer/MoSe2/FTO was recorded for five replicate measurements under the
same conditions. Five sets of the same electrodes were prepared with
the same concentration of the Salmonella aptamer and were employed
for the detection of the same concentration of target Salmonella.
All prepared electrodes showed similar results, which show good reproducibility
of the fabricated aptasensor represented in Figure 5b.

5th, 7th, and 21st Day) with five sets of same electrodes.

Application of Aptasensor
The developed
aptasensor
was also tested in a real sample (apple). The aptamer/MoSe2/FTO aptasensor was suitable for the detection of salmonella bacterial
strain (1 × 10–10 CFU/mL) in rotten apple juice.
The data obtained for the proposed aptasensor after adding in a real
sample is presented in Figure 5b, indicating good accuracy of the proposed aptamer-based
electrochemical bioassay for Salmonella detection.

Table 2 shows a comparative
study of aptamer-based biosensors developed for the detection of food-borne
pathogens. Abbaspour et al. ref (12) reported a dual-aptamer-based sandwich immunosensor
for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, where they employed a screen-printed carbon electrode for the fabrication,
which is expensive, requires specific connectors, single-use, disposable,
and shows limit of detection (LOD) of 1 CFU/mL, whereas others have
reported refs (13, 14) the use of
a glassy carbon electrode, which is relatively expensive and whose
cleaning process is also difficult. Also, it is having a disadvantage
of higher detection limits of 3 and 25 CFU/mL. Furthermore, the present
approach is based on an electrochemical aptasensor for the detection
of S. paratyphi, which showed excellent
results in terms of detection limit (10–10). The
modified electrode, that is, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode,
illustrated distinct features such as cost-effectiveness, high capacitive
behavior, facile cleaning, conductive behavior, and large surface
area. Moreover, 2D nanomaterials (MoSe2), owing to their
characteristic features such as high surface area, increased electron
transfer kinetics, and stability, have shown interesting features
such as good electrical conductivity due to the Se, which make the
material even more suitable for biosensing applications. This makes
the present approach better than the other works.

Conclusions
In this article, we reported the development of an aptasensor for
detection of S. paratyphi using a 2D
nanomaterial, MoSe2 nanobrooms. The developed aptasensor
exhibited high specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity toward S. paratyphi. MoSe2 exhibited fascinating
features such as high surface area, increased electron transfer kinetics,
and stability. The modified FTO electrode (MoSe2/FTO) was
used as a compatible matrix for the attachment of the NH2-modified aptamer. The electrochemically prepared aptasensor responded
linearly to the logarithm of the Salmonella concentration over the
range of 1 × 10–2 to 1 × 10–10 CFU/mL and was highly efficient with a low detection limit of 10–10 CFU/mL. To make it more economical, various other
economical substrates such as paper electrodes can be exploited for
futuristic application. However, in the case of the biological recognition
element, the present article revealed that nucleic acid aptamers are
best choice in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Chemicals used for the synthesis were of
analytical grade, purchased from different chemical companies, and
used without further purification. Sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O with 99% purity) was purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Selenium (Se with 99.99% purity), hydrazine
hydrate (N2H4·H2O), potassium
ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), potassium ferrocyanide
(K4[Fe(CN)6]), potassium chloride (KCl), and
glutaraldehyde were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. For the preparation
of solid LB medium: solid agar, sodium chloride (NaCl), tryptone and
yeast extract of Hi-Media were used. All of the other chemicals were
of analytical reagent grade. Aliquots of bacterial strains were acquired
from Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank CSIR-IMTECH,
Chandigarh (3220-S. paratyphi). E. coli was grown at the Amity Institute of Nanotechnology
under sterilized conditions in the lab. The amino-group-modified aptamer
nucleotide sequence of Salmonella was synthesized by GCC Biotech (GCC
Biotech India Pvt Ltd, India). The 41-mer aptamer sequence was obtained
from the work of Xiaoyuan et al. (2014): 5′-NH2-TAT
GGC GGC GTC ACC CGA CGG GGA CTT GAC ATT ATG ACA-G-3′. The aptamer
probe solution of varying concentrations was prepared in Tris–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) buffer solution (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA).

Apparatus
The aptamer-based electroanalysis of bacteria
was carried out at different stages by recording CV and DPV in an
Autolab PGSTAT-204 (Eco Chemie, The Netherlands. model: AUT83785),
and the results were analyzed by NOVA 1.8 software. It consists of
three-electrode systems: Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, Pt as a
counter electrode, and FTO as a working electrode. All of the electrochemical
experiments were performed at room temperature (RT, 25 °C). UV–vis
spectroscopy (Shimadzu 2600) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(Zeiss EVO 18 448) were performed to see the morphology of the nanostructures.
The analysis of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra by a Shimadzu
8700 FTIR spectrophotometer was done to identify organic, polymeric,
and, in some cases, inorganic materials. Phase identification was
carried out by X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation at 1.540 Å with 2θ in the range
of 10–80°.

Preparation and Characterization of Working
Electrode
The bacterial strains used in the study were S. paratyphi (MTCC: 3220) and other pathogenic strains
of E. coli for the detection of specificity
of the proposed aptasensor. Cultivation
of both bacterial strains was performed in Luria Broth (LB) medium
for 12 h, shaking in a 37 °C incubator. LB medium was prepared
using tryptone (10 g), yeast extract (5 g), and NaCl (10 g).13 The enriched bacteria were centrifuged at 5800
rpm for 10 min (25 °C) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (0.1 M, pH 7.4) several times. After washing with buffer, the
cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (10 mL) and was used as the original
bacterial sample; further concentrations were made by diluting this
in PBS. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm. The correlation between
optical density and bacterial concentration (CFU/mL) was determined,
at the beginning of this work, by the standard plate count method
for both bacterial strains.

Synthesis of 2D Nanomaterial MoSe2 Nanobrooms
Initially, 0.02 M sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water (DI) at
RT and stirred
with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min to give a clear solution. Se powder
(0.04 M) was mixed with hydrazine hydrate (10 mL: N2H4·H2O) at RT and stirred with a magnetic stirrer
for 15 min to give a dark brown suspension. Afterward, the selenium
solution was slowly added to the clear sodium molybdate solution at
RT under violent stirring for 20 min and an orange-brown solution
was obtained, which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave
and placed in a hot-air oven at 200 °C for 24 h. The obtained
solution was washed with distilled water and acetone and then dry-vacated
at 40 °C for 30 min.25

The formation
of broomlike nanostructures is explained on the basis of reaction
kinetics and reactant concentrations. The growth of nanostructures
involves two processes: nucleation and growth. The formation of nuclei
is dependent on the environmental conditions, such as acidic or basic
nature of the reactants; metal ion concentration; and hydrogen ion
concentration, i.e., pH, etc. Depending on these conditions, formation
of nuclei takes place, which further grow into corresponding nanostructures.

In the first step, Se is reduced to NaH Se by H2O with
the help of N2H4 (hydrazine hydrate) and Mo
O4–2 could be reduced to Mo+4. The reaction occurs between Mo+4 and Se–2, and formation of the MoSe2 nanostructure takes place
in a hydrothermal setup. As per the given experimental conditions,
the formation of rod-shaped nuclei takes place, which further grow
into the corresponding nano/microstructures that further self-assemble
themselves into broomlike nanostructures.

Preparation and Characterization
of Working Electrode
FTO electrodes were diced having sizes
3 cm × 2 cm using a diamond
cutter. The surface conductivity was measured using a multimeter.
The bare FTO electrode was cleaned sequentially in a mild detergent,
ethanol, and DI water, followed by drying at 100 °C. Subsequently,
it was washed several times with distilled water. Afterward, prepared
MoSe2NBs were drop-deposited homogeneously onto the surface
and kept for air-drying. A chitosan solution was dropped onto the
MoSe2 electrode and was kept overnight. Then, the chitosan-modified
electrode was exposed to 1 mL of glutaraldehyde solution (2.5%) for
12 h at RT to form Schiff base linkage. The aptamer sequence specific
to salmonella (50 μL), ranging from 20 to 100 μM, was
drop-deposited onto different glutaraldehyde-modified electrodes of
same dimensions and conductivity at 36 °C for 2 h. The −CHO
group of glutaraldehyde formed linkage with the −NH2-group-modified aptamer sequence. The electrodes were washed off
with ultrapure water. The electrode with the optimum concentration
of the aptamer sequence was used for the subsequent experiment. When
the polymer was cross-linked with the reagent such as glutaraldehyde,
which is a bilinker as the glutaraldehyde molecule consists of −CHO
group on both sides, where one side of the −CHO group will
attach with the amino group of chitosan and form Schiff base linkage
and the other −CHO group will covalently bind to the amino
group of the aptamer, a strong link was established between the chitosan
and the biomolecule. The capability of the developed aptasensors to
detect S. paratyphi was evaluated by
testing them with a solution containing various bacterial concentrations.
The general procedure is summarized in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Graphical Representation of the Aptamer-Based
Electrochemical Detection
of Salmonella Using a 2D Nanomaterial
Enrichment of Bacteria
Cultivation and plate counting
of bacteria were performed according to the method by Xiaoyuan Ma,
2014. Enrichment of the bacteria was performed by inoculating the
bacteria in the prepared LB broth media. The medium inoculated with
the bacteria was kept under continuous shaking for 2 days. The pellet
was suspended in PBS and diluted to obtain an optical density value
of 0.12 at 600 nm. Different concentrations of salmonella were prepared
ranging from 10–2 to 10–10 using
saline media. The prepared concentrations were cultured on solid media,
and bacterial colonies were counted (CFU/mL).

Electrochemical Aptasensor
for the Detection of S. paratyphi
Electrochemical characterization
was done using an electrochemical setup consisting of a working electrode
(ssDNA/MoSe2NBs/FTO), a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl),
and a counter electrode (Pt wire). The working electrodes of same
conductivity were exposed to different concentrations of salmonella
for 2 h at room temperature to allow maximum interaction with the
immobilized aptamer onto the surface of the working electrode. Afterward,
electrodes were washed to remove any unbound salmonella. Subsequently,
the electrode was analyzed through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques using electrochemical workstation.
The electrolyte used for electrochemical detection was potassium ferro/ferricyanide
(5 mM) containing 0.1 M KCl.

To detect the sensor specificity,
the prepared electrodes were also exposed to E. coli, used as control bacteria. Experiments (preparation of aptasensors,
cultivation, and enrichment) were performed using the same procedure
as that for S. paratyphi. Then, a 10–10 dilution of E. coli bacteria was used for the electrochemical aptasensor detection in
place of Salmonella, as described above.

Real Sample Analysis
To assess the general applicability
of the proposed aptasensor, we investigated the quantification of S. paratyphi in a rotten apple. A rotten apple (5
g) was crushed separately using mortar–pestle and mixed with
the help of PBS (pH 7.5). The resultant mixture was centrifuged for
10 min at 10 000 rpm, and the supernatant was taken for analysis.
The real sample (1 mL) was added directly into buffer, exposed to
the modified electrode, and further analyzed by electrochemical techniques.
