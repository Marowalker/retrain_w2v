In this article,
we describe the synthesis, characterization, and
optical properties of a photochromic-guest-incorporated metal-organic
framework (MOF). The photochromic guest molecule, 2-phenylazopyridine
(PAP), was introduced into a pre-synthesized porous crystalline host
MOF, [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1). The successful embedment of PAP has been
confirmed by elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction measurements,
IR spectroscopy, etc. The number of PAP molecules per unit cell of
host was 1.0, as evidenced by elemental and thermogravimetric analyses
of the host–guest composite, 1⊃PAP. The 1⊃PAP composite did not adsorb N2, revealed
by the adsorption isotherm of 1⊃PAP, which indicates
the pore blockage by the close contact of the host framework with
the guest PAP in the trans form. The light-induced trans/cis isomerization
with partial reversibility of the guest molecule (PAP) in this hybrid
host–guest compound (1⊃PAP) has been investigated
by detailed IR spectroscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy. The structural
transformation from tetragonal in 1 to orthorhombic in 1⊃PAP exhibits dynamic nature of the framework upon
inclusion of guest in the framework, which remarkably becomes nonresponsive
with the photoirradiation of guest PAP, retaining its orthorhombic
structure in the photoirradiated complex, 1⊃PAP(UV).

Introduction
Photoswitchable molecules
show promising applications in a variety
of applied fields, namely, molecular switches, bioimaging, switchable
catalysis, optical memory, optical limiting devices, and molecular
sensing because of their photoisomerized substantial conformational
changes, which induce alteration in their functional properties.1−7 Extensive investigations have been done on the inherent magnetic,
electrochemical, catalytic, and biological properties of the metal
complexes incorporating photoswitchable ligands.8 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a potential
interesting material in last 20 years because of their ultrahigh porosity,
high surface area, wide applicability in methane storage,9−12 harmful gas adsorption,13,14 separation of gases,14,15 and heterogeneous catalysis.16 Later,
solid photochromic metal-organic frameworks have also come up as an
intense field of research.17,18 Stock and co-workers
have developed photoresponsive azo compounds, covalently bound to
organic linker molecules as a side chain.19−21 Encapsulation
of drug molecules inside the host MOFs has also been studied by Férey
et al.22,23 The thermoresponsive study of a rigid nested
MOF with encapsulating guests by introducing a size-matching ligand
as bolt to lock the pores of MOF was investigated by Bu.24,25 Studies also revealed that metal nanoparticles inside the host MOFs
can be obtained through the decomposition of inserted precursor molecules
into MOFs.26,27 Furthermore, nanoscale titanium
particles were prepared as a guest inside MOF-5 by the solvent-free
adsorption method using titanium isopropoxide.28 However, the embedment of larger functional molecules in
MOFs is scarce. Among the photoswitchable molecules, mainly MOFs incorporating
azobenzene (AB) have been studied intensely because it has well-defined
photochromic behavior with clear absorption bands for trans/cis isomers
in the UV–vis spectrum. Ruschewitz reported several MOFs, namely,
MOF-5, MIL-68(Ga), MIL-68(In), and MIL-53(Al) loaded with azobenzene
and studied light-induced trans/cis isomerization, which revealed
that a different packing of azobenzene into the host is responsible
for their differential photoisomerization behavior.29 The influence of photoswitching properties of loaded guest
spiropyran on MOF-5 was investigated to compare its switching properties
in solution.30 The photoresponsive surface
area, pore volume, and CO2 uptake of spiropyran-incorporated
MOF-808 were also studied.31 Furthermore,
the intricate structural investigation by polarized light microscopy
shows the perfect alignment of photochrome diarylethene along the c axis of the host, DMOF-1.32 The photoswitching and photoluminescence properties of
azobenzene in nanoporous HKUST-1 MOF films were also examined using
UV–vis or only visible light.33,34 Moreover,
Kitagawa et al. reported a reversible structural change of the host
framework, observed with the photoswitching of azobenzene embedded
into the flexible MOF, [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n, leading to the drastic change in the gas adsorption
properties.35 Another important class of
photochromic ligand is 2-(arylazo)pyridines, and their photoactive
behaviors have been extensively studied in metal complexes.36 The photoswitching properties were well exploited
for the light-triggered fluorescence modulation of Zn–porphyrins.37 In particular, Llebaria has shown the potential
application of phenylazopyridines as photoisomerizable compounds to
control biological functions with light.38 Llebaria et al. have developed a series of phenylazopyridines with
light-dependent activity as negative allosteric modulators of metabotropic
glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5).38 Hitherto, no materials have been reported encapsulated
with 2-(phenylazo)pyridine (PAP). Hence, understanding of the photochromic
nature of the 2-(phenylazo)pyridine (PAP) molecule inside a solid
matrix is completely unknown.

For the first time, we have developed
a host–guest matrix,
where [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1) is used as a host and 2-(phenylazo)pyridine
(PAP) as a guest in this work. [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n has been chosen as the host
because of being colorless and thus minimally interfering in the optical
investigation. More importantly, the pores and channels of 1 are suitable for PAP, which is observed from the crystal structure
of 1 (vide infra). Again, we have explored the photoisomerization
of PAP in solid MOF and investigated the influence of conformational
transformation of PAP on the host hybrid MOF, 1. A striking
difference was observed in the host framework (1) upon
guest inclusion. Structural changes of the PAP molecule upon photoirradiation
do not cause structural transformation of the crystalline host framework,
which is a significant change in comparison with 1⊃AB (vide infra). This type of artificial guest-to-host structural flexibility/stability
has a great potential in producing a dynamic switching of the optic,
electric, and magnetic functions of the host–guest composites.
Nevertheless, it can be an important platform for further investigations
not only in gas storage but also as a sensor.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The photosensitive guest
ligand, 2-(phenylazo)pyridine, was synthesized by a combination of
2-aminopyridine and nitrosobenzene in basic medium (see the Experimental Section). The product was purified
by silica gel chromatography with the pet ether (80%) and ethyl acetate
(20%) solvent system and was characterized in detail by analytical
and spectroscopic techniques. The porous metal-organic framework [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n(1) (Scheme 1) has been prepared using the solvothermal process in a Teflon-lined
steel bomb containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, H2bdc, and dabco ligands in the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent (see the Experimental Section). The solid framework of 1 was characterized for crystallinity, surface area, and morphology
using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption,
and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies, respectively.

Scheme 1 Schematic Three-Dimensional (3D) Structure of [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1)39
The single crystal of MOF 1 was successfully
generated.
The cell parameters and data exactly matched with those of the guest-free
crystal structure reported by Kim et al. (Figure S1a).39 The MOF 1 structure
appears as a lower-symmetry tetragonal form with cell parameters a = b = 10.93(3) Å and c = 9.06(2) Å. It was observed that terephthalic acid ligands
are linearly attached to the paddle–wheel Zn2 unit,
resulting in a perfect two-dimensional square grid, which is linked
with the dabco ligands to form a three-dimensional framework. Most
importantly, the structure comprises a significant distance of ∼10
Å between two adjacent Zn2 paddle–wheel units
in the layer including wide open channels ∼7.5 Å along
the c axis (Figure S1b), which is an utmost requirement for the insertion of large functional
molecule PAP. Notably, the length of azobenzene is ∼9.0 Å
in its trans form, and after irradiation, it decreases to ∼5.5
Å in the cis isomer.40,41 Hence, from geometric
consideration, PAP should fit into the channels or pores of the MOF
structure.

Trans-PAP has been loaded into the
pores or channels
of 1 at room temperature (see the Experimental
Section). To confirm the complete insertion of PAP molecules
into the pores of 1⊃PAP, we have studied the leaching
experiment (Figure S2) where we have mixed 1⊃PAP with CHCl3 and kept it for 12 h. It
was observed that compound 1⊃PAP is still orange,
whereas the upper solvent is completely colorless. The upper solvent
was monitored by UV spectroscopy, which certainly rules out the possibility
of PAP on the surface of MOF 1. The IR measurement of
the residue, 1⊃PAP, was performed to ensure the
presence of PAP (vide infra). It is needless to say that the PAP ligand
is red and highly soluble in CHCl3. This confirms the complete
inclusion of PAP inside 1 i.e., 1⊃PAP, which becomes completely insoluble in CHCl3. Moreover,
while investigating the back-switching photoisomerization process
of free PAP, which was performed thermally at 60 °C for 40 h,
it was observed that the transmittance intensity of obtained trans-PAP from cis-PAP was significantly
lower compared to that of the original trans-PAP,
whereas the transmittance intensity of 1⊃PAP does
not alter under the same experiment conditions. This again attributes
successful loading of PAP in channels or pores of MOF 1, not on the surface of MOF 1 (vide infra).

Figure S3 exhibits the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of MOF 1, free PAP ligand, and
host–guest composite 1⊃PAP. It should be
noted here that the azo N=N stretching vibration42 of the free PAP ligand appears near 1424 cm–1, whereas the same vibration shifts to lower energy
if the azo N=N is coordinated with Zn to form a complex.43 The IR data of 1⊃PAP presents
no peak in the range of 1380–1400 cm–1 although
a strong signal is visible at 1422 cm–1 similar
to that in the IR spectrum of the free PAP ligand because of the N=N
stretching vibration. This also indicates the non-coordinating mode
of the azo nitrogen of the PAP ligand. Furthermore, the tendency of
axial coordination of pyridine nitrogen in 3- and 2-(phenylazo)pyridines
to ZnTPP is substantially different, as reported by Otsuki et al.37 The pyridine nitrogen of trans-2-(phenylazo)pyridine does not favor to coordinate with Zn in the
ZnTPP complex because of appreciable hindrance coming from the phenylazo
group at the 2 position, whereas the large association constant has
been obtained between trans-MeO-3-Azo and ZnTPP.37 This strongly suggests the active nature of
PAP as a guest over the nonactive nature of the PAP ligand as a binding
site in the present 1⊃PAP composite.

Elemental
analysis and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) have been
performed to obtain the composition of PAP molecules per unit cell
of MOF 1. The TGA data indicates that composite 1⊃PAP loses its guest molecule, PAP, in the temperature
range of 150–250 °C and the decomposition of the resulting
porous host framework starts after 300 °C (Figure S4). As evidenced by elemental analyses, the number
of PAP ligand as a guest per unit cell of 1 was 1.0 (Tables S1 and S2), which agrees with the weight
loss observed in TGA in the temperature range of 150–200 °C.

The successful introduction of the PAP molecule into host 1 was also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements.
Significant changes in the reflection intensities in PXRD patterns
have been observed after inclusion of PAP in 1 (Figure 1). It should be noted
here that the PXRD pattern of as-synthesized MOF 1 is
consistent with the PXRD pattern of the guest-free sample reported
by Kim et al.39 PXRD measurements show
a significant shifting of peaks to the higher 2θ values from 1 to 1⊃PAP. Moreover, the PXRD pattern
of 1⊃PAP is similar to that of the composite reported
with azobenzene in [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1), described by Kitagawa et
al.35 It was also consistent with the compound
obtained after introducing benzene into 1.39 As mentioned in the reported papers that the
overall connectivity of the framework remains undisturbed but the
tetragonal structure is transformed to an orthorhombic crystal framework,
featuring dynamic behavior of MOF 1, the present 1⊃PAP system also exhibits a similar phenomenon, leading
to shrinking upon guest inclusion with structural transformation from
a square grid to an orthorhombic net.

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of (a) MOF 1 (black) and (b) 1⊃PAP (red).

Photoswitching Study
The photoswitching
study of 1⊃PAP (Scheme 2) has been carried out by UV–vis spectroscopy,
IR spectroscopy,
and 1H NMR measurements. Photoisomerization of guest trans-PAP to cis-PAP inside 1⊃PAP (Scheme 2) has been
achieved upon UV irradiation (380 nm), whereas the back-switching
(cis-to-trans) was achieved thermally (heating sample at 60 °C).
The data obtained were compared with the photoisomerization data of
free PAP in the same conditions.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of trans-PAP to cis-PAP Geometrical Transformation
inside the Orthorhombic
Solid Framework of [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1)
The free PAP exhibits a strong absorbance at λ =
318 nm because
of the π–π* transition and comparatively less intense
absorbance band at λ = 454 nm because of the n–π* transition of the azo (N=N)
group (Figure S5).44 After UV irradiation, there is a significant decrease in the 320
nm absorption band in PAP(UV), confirming the transformation
of trans-PAP to cis-PAP. The reversible
back-switching was achieved by applying heat. It is denoted PAP(Heat). The absorbance at 320 nm again increases, proving
the reversible nature of the photochromic behavior of the PAP ligand
(Figure S5). Similar phenomena have been
observed upon UV irradiation of 1⊃PAP in the solid
state (Figure 2).

Figure 2 UV–vis
spectra of 1⊃PAP (black), 1⊃PAP(UV) (red), and 1⊃PAP(Heat) (green) and the switching
cycle of 1⊃PAP (pink)
in the inset.

The 325 nm absorption
band decreases upon UV irradiation although
the intensity has not been diminished fully upon prolonging UV irradiation,
indicating the photostationary state of the PAP ligand inside the
solid framework. This is termed as 1⊃PAP(UV).
The ratio of cis/trans isomer is 28:72, which is less compared to
the free PAP in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, giving isomerization
to the cis isomer about 60%. This can be accounted as the restricted
conformational transformation of the PAP ligand because of hindrance
in the solid state, whereas free rotation is possible in the solution
phase.

The back-switching was checked upon giving heat on 1⊃PAP(UV). The intensity of the 325 nm absorption band
was regained but not
fully, comprising partial reversibility of the photochromic process.
The spectrum of 1⊃PAP(Heat) (green) in Figure 2 has been recorded
after heating 1⊃PAP(UV) at 60 °C for 10 h.
The observed partial reversibility could be because of the photobleaching
effect as the back process requires prolong heating or the steric
hinderance of the switching process. Same observations were made with
repeating this procedure. Partial reversibility was also reported
previously for a metal-organic framework with a photoswitchable phenylazo
group.19 Again, according to Kitawaga’s
report, more than 80% cis-azobenzene in 1⊃AB(UV) remained after 1 month if no external stimuli were used,35 indicating that the geometrical conversion from cis-azo to trans-azo is a much slower process.
This could be a reason for getting partial reversibility because it
takes a longer time even with external stimuli. Also, in the present
system, as no structural transformation of the host framework has
been occurred (vide infra), it makes the back-switching process nonlabile.
The photoswitching cycle has been also measured (Figure 2 inset). It was observed that
the photochromic process is switchable up to three cycles, after which
the reversibility is significantly going down.

The photoswitching
behavior of trans-PAP to cis-PAP
in 1⊃PAP was also investigated
by IR spectroscopy (see the Experimental Section for method). In the case of free PAP, after UV irradiation, a new
peak emerged at 702 cm–1, which is because of the
formation of cis-PAP, whereas trans-PAP has a characteristic peak at 690 cm–1 (Figure S6).

It can be noted here that the
IR spectrum of azobenzene-inserted
MOF 1 exhibits a peak at 690 cm–1 in
its trans form, whereas upon irradiation, a new peak generated at
697 cm–1 for the cis isomer, reported by Kitagawa
et al.35 A similar observation was made
for 1⊃PAP, where a peak at 702 cm–1 corresponding to the cis form of the PAP ligand was generated (Figure 3). The new peak at
702 cm–1 was disappeared upon giving heat, which
indicates reversibility of the photochromic process although it is
partial (vide supra). The ratio of the cis/trans isomer is 26:74 calculated
using IR spectroscopy, which is similar to the data obtained from
UV–vis measurements, indicating the authenticity of the isomerization
process inside the hybrid framework. The ratio of geometrical conversion
was also studied by the 1H NMR study, which is consistent
with the data obtained by UV–vis and IR spectroscopic methods
(vide infra).

Figure 3 IR spectra of 1⊃PAP (black), 1⊃PAP(UV) (red), and 1⊃PAP(Heat) (blue).

The back-switching process was
also attempted by applying light
(500 nm). It shows a decrease in intensity of the 702 cm–1 peak, but less reversibility was obtained compared to that in the
heat method in the same time interval, which indicates that the back
process with light follows a slower kinetics than with heat (Figure S7). Moreover, the reversibility of 1⊃AB was also checked by treating 1⊃AB(UV) with heat.35

The photoswitching
study can be performed up to three cycles by
IR spectroscopic measurements similar to UV–vis study (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Photoswitching cycle
of 1⊃PAP.

Furthermore, the photochromic process has been investigated
by
the 1H NMR study. The guest molecules (PAP) were isolated
from the composite material by dissolving them in a tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(Na4EDTA) solution. The nine aromatic protons from trans-PAP appear in the range of 8.7–7.39 ppm (Figure 5). However, the 1H NMR spectrum obtained after photoirradiation shows the signals
from both the geometrical forms of trans-PAP and cis-PAP. The new peaks appearing at 8.37 and 6.6–7.2
ppm represent the cis isomer of PAP. The peak positions for both the
isomers are consistent with the literature value.36 The proton signals of isolated PAP from 1⊃PAP(Heat) show only the trans isomer, revealing the reversibility of the photochromic
process, as suggested by other studies. The 1H NMR study
gave a cis/trans isomer ratio of 25:75, which is consistent with the
result obtained from UV and IR spectroscopy. Notably, in the case
of the azobenzene composite with MOF 1, the obtained
cis/trans isomer ratio was 38:62, indicating partial switching.35

from (a) 1⊃PAP, (b) 1⊃PAP(UV), and (c) 1⊃PAP(Heat).

Characterization of 1⊃PAP(UV)
The
MOF composite after UV irradiation, 1⊃PAP(UV),
was characterized by PXRD measurements. PXRD data obtained for the 1⊃PAP(UV) composite shows no change in the pattern
from its precursor (Figure 6), 1⊃PAP, revealing the orthorhombic crystal
form for 1⊃PAP(UV) after UV irradiation also.
It is remarkable to state that the photoinduced conformational transformation
of the guest PAP ligand is functional without disturbing the crystal
lattice framework. Additionally, it should be noted here that [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1) was famous for its flexible nature,39 which was also observed in the case of azobenzene-embedded
MOF 1 where the rhombic form of 1⊃AB was distorted to form a tetragonal form for 1⊃AB(UV) upon UV irradiation while going from the trans form of azobenzene
to the cis form of azobenzene.35

Figure 6 PXRD patterns
of (a) 1⊃PAP, (b) 1⊃PAP(UV), and (c) 1⊃PAP(Heat).

Repetition of Kitagawa’s work has been carried out
to investigate
whether the framework shows flexibility with azobenzene (AB) photoisomerization
under the same irradiation conditions used for PAP. The trans-to-cis
photoisomerization of AB in the pores of 1 has been performed by IR and PXRD measurements. The PXRD measurements
were carried out for 1⊃AB, 1⊃AB(UV), and 1⊃AB(Heat) (Figure S8), which show similar observation with the reported data,35 revealing the transformation of the orthorhombic
structure of 1⊃AB to the tetragonal form in 1⊃AB(UV) upon irradiation of azobenzene, confirming
the flexible nature of the framework and authenticity of our experiment
with 1⊃PAP. In the IR study, the native IR spectrum
of 1⊃AB showed a peak at 690 cm–1 because of the trans isomer, and after UV irradiation, a new peak
at 697 cm–1 was emerged because of the formation
of the cis isomer of AB. The back-switching was also
carried out by applying heat (Figure S9). The data is consistent with the result reported by Kitagawa et
al., which indicates that the photoisomerization conditions used for
the current work are feasible for PAP. The unexpected nonresponsive
behavior of 1⊃PAP upon photoirradiation of PAP
compared to that of MOF 1 with the inclusion of azobenzene
may be because of the interaction of the pyridine-N atom of PAP with
the paddle–wheel of the MOF, eventually replacing dabco at
least partly. Also, it can be explicated that the attractive interaction
between 1 and PAP is significantly weaker than the attractive
interaction between 1 and trans-azobenzene.

The SEM images of 1⊃PAP and 1⊃PAP(UV) are shown in Figure 7. The morphologies of both the MOF composites 1⊃PAP and 1⊃PAP(UV) were well-defined rhombic crystals
at 50 μm. Both show a very similar feature, which suggested
that isomerization does not lead to a change in the morphology. The
thermal treatment of 1⊃PAP(UV) denoted 1⊃PAP(Heat) to obtain trans-PAP back in 1 shows
the same PXRD pattern, revealing the rhombic network of the MOF structure
(Figure 6).

Figure 7 SEM images
of (a) 1⊃PAP and (b) 1⊃PAP(UV).

The electron beam diffractions
of 1⊃PAP and 1⊃PAP(UV) were
measured using a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) (Figure 8). In both the cases, the diffraction patterns were attributed
to the orthorhombic host structure. Hence, indeed, there is no structural
change in the host after UV irradiation.

Figure 8 TEM images for (a) 1⊃PAP and (b) 1⊃PAP(UV) and in
the inset their diffraction patterns.

Again, to understand the unusual nonresponsive behavior of
the
host, nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed for both the
composite materials. It was observed that 1⊃PAP does not adsorb N2, which was expected because the pores
of the host molecules were blocked because of the close contact of
the guest moiety with the host framework. After irradiating 1⊃PAP with UV light, the amount of adsorbed N2 increases to 20 mL g–1 (Figure 9), which is significantly lower than that
for 1⊃AB where the adsorption amount drastically
increases to 45 mL g–1.35 It was explained that the expansion of the host framework to the
tetragonal form upon UV irradiation in 1⊃AB increases
the microporosity of the material.35 Hence,
the slight increase in the amount of adsorbed N2 in the
present system, 1⊃PAP(UV), can be attributed only
to the conformational change in guest PAP (trans to cis) without any
change in the host framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first example of the unusual inflexibility of a metal-organic
framework by conformational changes of a photoresponsive guest molecule.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
synthesized, characterized, and investigated
the photochromic behavior of 2-phenylazopyridine (PAP) embedded in
metal-organic framework 1. The cis/trans isomerization
of the PAP ligand occurs within the pores or nanochannels of MOF by
irradiating the MOF composite with UV light, whereas back-switching
has been successfully achieved thermally. Notably, the framework structure
of [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2(dabco)]n (1) does not show any structural transformation
of the host with conformational changes of embedded photochromic guest
molecule PAP, showing the unexpected nonresponsive behavior of the 1⊃PAP composite. Because of this surprising unperturbation,
there is little change in nitrogen adsorption behavior going from 1⊃PAP to 1⊃PAP(UV). The present
work highlights a simple strategy to control the guest-to-host structural
transmission combined with induced structural inflexibility by guest
photoisomerization using light as external stimuli.

Experimental

Instruments
The powder diffraction measurements were
carried out using Lab XRD-6100 Shimadzu with Cu Kα1 radiation. FT-IR measurements were performed as KBr pellets on Spectrum
Two FT-IR spectrometers by PerkinElmer. The UV–vis spectra
of the solid and solution were recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
by Shimadzu, UV-1800 instrument. TGA analysis has been done using
an STA 6000 Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (PerkinElmer). The heating

Synthesis of 2-(Phenylazo)pyridine (PAP)
The ligand, 2-(phenylazo)pyridine (PAP), has
been synthesized by
the method used in a previous paper.45 Yield

Synthesis of 1⊃PAP
MOF 1 was washed three times with CHCl3 to exchange solvent.
The solid was activated by heating at 120 °C under vacuum for
12 h. The material (1) was cooled down to room temperature
(35 °C). MOF 1 (200 mg) was taken in a sealed two-necked
round bottom flask and degassed by applying vacuum. PAP (200 mg) (liquid
in nature at 35 °C) was added in activated 1 at
35 °C and was kept for 20 h. trans-PAP was adsorbed
into the pores/nanochannels of 1. Excess PAP was removed
by heating at 58 °C, where excess PAP was deposited on the side
wall of the flask. The orange host–guest composite is termed
as 1⊃PAP. The product, 1⊃PAP, has been characterized by various spectroscopic techniques (vide
supra).

Leaching Experiment
The leaching experiment was performed
using 0.010 g of the 1⊃PAP sample mixed with 5
mL of CHCl3 in a vial. It was mixed well and kept for settling
down. It was observed that the 1⊃PAP composite
was orange, but the upper solvent remained colorless (monitored by
UV–vis spectroscopy).

Photoswitching Experiment
The photoswitching
experiment
was performed with a 150 W Xe lamp with a suitable optical filter
(380 nm) to selectively irradiate the sample. The UV–vis spectra
have been recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV-1800 with inbuilt TCC-100 (thermoelectrically temperature controlled
cell holder)). For the solid UV–vis method, a known amount
of MOF 1 has been uniformly pasted in a circular disk
form on the quartz slide, which was kept in the sample holder, and
the base line spectrum has been recorded. The same amount of 1⊃PAP has been taken in the same manner, and the spectrum
was recorded. The 1⊃PAP-pasted quartz slide has
been irradiated by light (380 nm), and spectra (in situ) were recorded
at certain intervals of time.

to calculate the cis/trans ratio from the UV–vis method.46 1  For the IR method,
base line has been recorded
with the KBr pellet. A mixture of KBr and 1⊃PAP has been used for the preparation of pellet, which was used for
the IR experiment. The pellet was irradiated with 380 nm light, and
the spectra were recorded at certain time intervals. The back-switching
process has been checked by applying light (500 nm) and thermally
(60 °C). The ratio of cis isomer was also calculated from IR
spectroscopy. 2 was used to calculate the cis/trans
ratio from the IR method, where Tcis and Ttrans belong to the transmittance at 702 cm–1 (cis) and 690 cm–1 (trans), respectively. 2  

1H NMR Study
The 1H NMR study
was carried out using an Agilent Technologies (1H NMR 400
MHz) instrument. The guest PAP molecules were isolated by dissolving
the composite material 1⊃PAP in a tetrasodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na4EDTA) solution. The same
method was followed for isolating the PAP molecule from 1⊃PAP(UV) and 1⊃PAP(Heat). The cis/trans ratio was calculated
from the intensity change of a particular peak for one proton.47
