Visually
tracking the subtle aspects of biological systems in real time during
tissue culture remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate the use
of bioactive, cytocompatible, and biodegradable inverse opals from
silk as a multifunctional substrate to transduce both the optical
information and cells during tissue culture. We show that these substrates
can visually track substrate degradation in various proteases during
tissue digestion and protein deposition during the growth of mesenchymal
stem cells. Uniquely, these substrates can be integrated in multiple
steps of tissue culture for simple-to-use, visual, and quantitative
detectors of bioactivity. These substrates can also be doped, demonstrated
here with gold nanoparticles, to allow additional control of cell
functions.

Introduction
Tracking the changes
in biological systems during tissue culture
provides insight into the dynamic changes and optimization of outcomes.
This insight allows the systems to play a more critical role in medicine,
pharmacology, and fundamental research. Biosensing schemes designed
to facilitate “smart” cell and tissue culture traditionally
exploit a variety of biosignals, including electrical properties1−5 (impedance or electrical potential), mechanics,6−9 and secreted biomolecules, such
as extracellular matrix (often using interferometry).10−13 Optical biosensors are among the least invasive of the above modes
of detection, which can potentially provide direct, visual feedback
on cell activity without the need for additional external interrogation.
Examples of biosensors include diffraction gratings, opaline lattices,
and Bragg reflectors, which have been used to detect protease activity,
biomolecules (both concentration and adsorption), and biochemistry.10,14−17

The majority of these optical structures are based on silicon/porous
silicon or synthetic polymers, which are formed by either traditional,
time-consuming microfabrication techniques (in the case of silicon)
or templating (for polymeric materials). In general, these structures
must be chemically postprocessed and doped to interface with living
tissue. For example, to study protease activity, substrates must be
modified or infiltrated with proteins, such as zein or gelatin, to
obtain a bioresponsive surface and substrate.14,15 Of note, in the majority of these optical biosensors, the optical
effect is not overt and requires external interrogation, such as a
spectrometer.18 Generally, such substrates
are also inert sensors and cannot be easily modified to interact with
the biological systems they measure (i.e., provide growth factors,
enzymes, or engineered stimuli). In contrast to silicon and synthetic
polymers, biopolymers are a potentially simpler and “greener”
material counterpart due to their native biocompatibility and renewable
sourcing. Recent efforts have focused on engineering such biomaterials
to possess controlled three-dimensional micro- and nano-structures.
For example, chitosan has been formed into mesoscale inverse opal
microstructures, through which cells can infiltrate and grow,19 and optically responsive nanostructured inverse
opals have been formed from biopolymers keratin and silk fibroin.16,20,21In
addition to providing a colorimetric response, such substrates are
easily doped with biomolecules and inorganic compounds,22 enabling more functional capabilities than those
of traditional silicon-based sensors.

In this article, we utilize
inverse opals formed directly from
native or doped silk protein to form multifunctional substrates capable
of passive sensing of protease activity (commonly used to digest tissues
or release cells from a substrate) and biological substrate remodeling
(commonly generated by fibroblasts or stem cells). The sensing is
colorimetric and visible to the eye, with additional potential for
cell activation/disruption via direct doping of the substrate. Such
visual detection can be achieved in situ, potentially allowing direct
transduction from active substrates without having to utilize fluorescence
detection methods that often require fixation or destruction of cells
along with the use of optical systems for their excitation and detection.
The inverse opals formed from silk enable effective, simple biosensors
and functional substrates for “smart” biological tissue
culture platforms. Silk fibroin, due to its mechanical strength and
low surface tension, has found applications in drug delivery,23 tissue engineering,24 optics,16 electronics,25,26 and so on. The use of silk in tissue culture has numerous notable
advantages, including the facilitation of cell growth and proliferation
without dopants or postprocessing,27 the
ability to stabilize dopants (such as enzymes and growth factors),22,28,29 and tunable biodegradability
when exposed to proteases.30,31 These advantages have
enabled the use of silk biomaterials in a diverse set of tissue culture
applications ranging from stem cell differentiation32 to tissue formation33 and mechanotransduction
studies.34 Previously, silk inverse opal
substrates have been used to track humidity,35 as a substrate for cell growth (10 μm pores),36 and to study analyte-binding events.37 Here, we study the potential of such substrates as an active
biointerface to optically and quantitatively track the growth/remodeling
of cells and the digestive state of tissue when subjected to protease.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that such substrates can be easily doped
to provide functional interfaces with biological systems, thus providing
an additional layer of control that is not easily achieved in traditional,
silicon-based, or other inorganic substrate materials.

Results and Discussion
Silk inverse opals were formed via capillary infiltration into
a colloidal template. Circular 4–6 mm inverse opal templates
were formed via evaporative drying of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
beads (Phosphorex, 1% suspension of 250 nm and 300 nm diameter beads)
on a PMMA-spun silicon substrate. Subsequently, silk solution (6%)
was cast, alongside optional dopants, onto template substrates and
slowly dried over 24 h to form inverse opal structures cast within
a silk film (Figure 1a). Silk films dried via this approach were primarily amorphous and
water-soluble. To render inverse opals water-insoluble (and thus viable
for tissue culture), the films were water-annealed for a minimum of
4 h to transform the silk fibroin into water-insoluble α-helix
and β-sheet conformations. The PMMA template was then dissolved
overnight in acetone before being solvent-exchanged to water first
via immersion in isopropanol and then with the slow addition of water.

reflectance in water. (f, g) Open-faced inverse opals formed from

The band gap maximum wavelength of inverse opal structures
can
be estimated using the equation38  where D is the periodicity
of the structure, φ is the fill percentage/porosity (0.06 for
typical inverse opals), and n is the refractive index
of the solid (nsilk ∼ 1.6) and
the void regions (nair = 1 and nwater = 1.33) of the inverse opals. Increases
in the PMMA bead size and reduction in the index difference between
the walls and the voids led to a redshift in the band gap peak wavelength
of the structure. The optical response of the silk inverse opals was
probed using a fiber-coupled spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB2000+;
Dunedin, FL) in a reflection geometry. In air, the inverse opals possess
peak reflectance in the blue (λ ≈ 410 nm) and teal (λ
≈ 500 nm) regions that correspond to the stopband of the structures
with lattice periodicities of 250 and 300 nm, respectively. When immersed
in water or culture medium (n = 1.33), the inverse
opals lightly swelled and the index contrast changed with red-shifting
of the reflective peaks to λ ≈ 575 and 660 nm (Figure 1b–e). The
inverse opals formed together from the same silk treatments will have
minor variations in reflective peaks (±2 nm), although reflectance
peaks from the samples formed from different batches can vary more
significantly (±20 nm) due to silk age and crystallization. The
crystallinity of silk fibroin affects its swelling when immersed,
which is primarily responsible for the batch-to-batch variation in
the peak reflectance center wavelength. The silk inverse opal structures
could be visualized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that
shows a three-dimensional face-centered cubic lattice of voids (Figure 1f,g). To visualize
the lattice of these nanostructures, we generated “open-faced”
structures via reflow of the PMMA/photoresist sacrificial layer.

A
major aspect of tissue culture is enzymatic digestion: a step used
for cell passage, to isolate primary cell lines from tissue; extract
proteins, DNA, and other biomolecules; and assess substrate remodeling
during tissue regeneration. We first studied the potential of undoped
silk inverse opals as sensors for protease activity and tissue digestion
(Figure 2). Silk possesses
cleavage sites for a majority of proteases, such as collagenase, proteinase
K, protease XIV, matrix metalloproteinases, and others.30 The temporal response of the inverse opals to
different concentrations of protease XIV (commonly used to nonspecifically
dissociate tissues) was first assessed. In general, we would expect
two responses during a protease etch (Figure S1): (1) a blueshift in the band gap peak wavelength due to the loss
of high-index material in the inverse opal wall and (2) a reduction
in the reflectance due to the nonisotropic etching reducing the quality
of the inverse opal network. This expected response was observed at
both high and low concentrations of protease XIV (Figure S2, N = 4), indicating the capability
of the opals to optically transduce and visibly resolve digestion
rate. Subsequently, the reflectance degradations of control samples
(in water) and those incubated in a variety of proteases, including
two concentrations of collagenase, protease XIV, and proteinase K,
were compared. As expected, increasing the concentrations of either
collagenase or protease XIV led to high rates of reduction in reflectance
intensity. The observed color-change dynamics was different for different
enzymes used (i.e., Proteinase K > protease XIV > collagenase,
indicating
that proteinase K degrades the substrate at the highest rate). This
result matches that of the previous studies on silk degradation30 and suggests that these structures can track
proteinase K- and protease XIV-based digestion mixtures more easily
than the collagenase-based ones. The protease variability in the response
also suggests that these structures are more suited for sensing the
activity of known protease cocktails rather than the proteolytic activity
of biological cells (which secrete complex mixtures of proteases).
The response was close to linear for the protease concentrations and
exposure times used in our experiments. For example, the reflective
peak frequency shifted 3 nm for 1× concentration of protease
XIV in 60 min, whereas it shifted 12 nm for 5× concentration
of protease XIV in the same amount of time (results were similar for
absorbance studies). The results suggest that the inverse opal biosensors
can be used both as a transducer of silk degradation for basic studies
and as a directly visible marker of protease activity and digestion
competition during the tissue dissociation steps.

of reflectance degradations in a variety of proteases. (d) Bandwidth
peak wavelength over time during incubation in protease XIV.

During degradation of the opals,
the wavelength shifts are of the
order of 10 nm. From theory, changes in the inverse opal fill factor
of 0.01 yield a shift of ∼1 nm, implying a higher observed
shift than expected.38 This difference
is likely due to a collapse or shrinking of the inverse opal structure
during protease digestion. SEM images of cryofractured inverse opal
structures (Figure 3) before and after the protease digestion show both random disruption
of the lattice and an associated increase in porosity. The thickness
of protease-etched structures was less than half of that of nonetched
(control) structures, indicating a significant collapse during the
digestion and drying process.

Figure 3 (a) Cryofractured silk inverse opal. The thickness
of the opal
structure is approximately 4–5 μm. Scale bar is 200 nm.
(b) Cryofractured protease XIV-degraded opal. The resultant structure
is different from that of a standard opal and possesses an increase
in porosity and nanostructure collapse. The thickness was approximately
2 μm, confirming partial structure collapse during drying. Scale
bar is 1 μm. (c) Degradation of inverse opal (∼2 mm wide)
color during asymmetric addition of proteinase K. The protease was
added above the structure, and the color degradation was observed
over time. Scale bar is 2 mm.

The visible response of the silk inverse opals to proteases
was
demonstrated using the time-lapse imaging of the structures during
the addition of proteinase K by adding 20 μL of protease on
the opal structures and imaging the response over 30 min. The inverse
opal steadily degraded and the structural color slowly disappeared,
indicating the ability to visibly distinguish response without the
aid of external interrogation with a spectrometer.

Because of
the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, fetal foreskin
fibroblast cells were cultured directly on the inverse opals to study
their effect on cell adhesion and patterning. Inverse opals formed
in a standard format (on PMMA) exhibited a minor effect on cell patterning
(Figure 4a). Although
large-cavity holes were found to modulate cell adhesion on other surfaces,
this phenomenon was not observed for the inverse opals formed from
250 and 300 nm beads. Interestingly,
silk nanostructured surfaces (formed via PMMA bead formation on photoresist
and subsequent induction
of heavy reflow, as described in the Experimental
Section) modulated cell adhesion consistently with that reported
in the literature39 (Figure S4b), leading to an increase in the local coverage
of cells above the “rough” nanostructured region.

comparison for different inverse opals, one set doped with BMP and
the other undoped. Samples with cell growth exhibited broadening of
the band gap and a redshift, and trypsinization of the samples resulted
in partial recovery of the initial opal response.

The potential of silk inverse opals to track substrate remodeling
during cell growth was studied. Osteogenic differentiating mesenchymal
stem cells were utilized to study the growth and release of growth
factors, matrix metalloproteinases, insoluble matrix, and mineralization,
which combine to remodel existing substrates.40 These cells are also important in pharmacology and medicine for
regenerative medicine. hMSCs were seeded onto four green (peak reflectance
λ ≈ 500 nm; lattice constant 300 nm) inverse opal substrates.
Two of the opals were doped with bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2)
and allowed to grow in differentiation medium over 24 days to induce
osteogenesis (Figure S4c). At 24 days,
a redshift and dimming in the inverse opal response was noted. Half
of the samples were fixated in formaldehyde and the other half were
trypsinized for 10 min (followed by cold shock for 1 h) to remove
proteins from the surface. These samples were then compared with untreated
inverse opals using optical imaging and a spectrometer. The samples
incubated with cells exhibited a significant redshift of up to 30
nm alongside a noticeable loss in luster that was visible to the eye
(Figure 4). Trypsinized
samples exhibited partial recovery of the original inverse opal behavior,
indicating that biomolecules and mineralization entrapped by insoluble
and adsorbed proteins (likely a high percentage of collagen) were
likely the sources of the redshift and the associated dimming of the
inverse opal response. To expose the surface for SEM imaging, the
cells were gently scraped from the substrate and the samples were
dried by critical-point drying, followed by the deposition of a thin
layer of gold for imaging. Mesenchymal stem cell cultures occlude
nano-holes over time41 (reducing their
visibility), and a similar response was noted on the substrates prepared
here (Figure 4b). Trypsinized
surfaces did not exhibit this effect, suggesting that the trypsinization
process removed the occlusions within the opal lattice.

The
samples were also cryofractured to observe the internal structure
of the nanostructured lattice (Figure 5). The images revealed significant filling within the
inverse opal with an observable deposition of biomaterial on the internal
surface of the opal voids at a depth between 20 and 50 nm. This reflects
a change in the fill factor/porosity of the opal from 0.06 up to a
range between 0.15 and 0.4. This is associated to a redshift of ∼40
nm, which suggests the ability of silk inverse opals to optically
track the dynamic changes in substrate remodeling during tissue culture.

The ease of dopability of silk (i.e., with biomolecules,22 gold nanoparticles,16 quantum dots,42 etc.) additionally provides
excellent opportunities in creating a programmable and interactive
substrate for use during cell culture, which is otherwise not possible
with traditional inorganic materials. To demonstrate this concept,
the silk inverse opals were formed by including gold nanoparticles
(Au-NP: diameter ∼10 nm) in the silk solution (Figure S5). These particles absorb strongly at
their plasmonic resonant frequency, converting light into heat.16Such
functional substrates were excited with a green laser (532 nm), increasing
the local temperature to 70 °C under aqueous conditions, as measured
via infrared thermography. When exciting substrates while growing
cells, it was possible to target specific areas of the culture, such
as patterned structures, and affect cell fate locally, inducing local
cell death by directing light on the culture surface. These simple
experiments hint at the versatility of these material systems that
can enable a smart culture system with built-in multifunctionality
and programmable function.

In conclusion, we have explored the
potential of inverse opal structures
derived from silk biopolymers as a platform material for “smart”
tissue culture. The native properties of such structures (including
biocompatibility and biodegradability) allow these systems to be used
as sensors during multiple phases of tissue culture, including growth,
digestion steps, and remodeling. Such a platform can also be straightforwardly
doped, allowing for an additional layer of interaction and control
in such devices. Silk inverse opal sensors display a rapid visual
response in the presence of a variety of proteases used in tissue
digestion, whereas their biocompatibility (in either undoped or doped
format) facilitates the growth and remodeling of surfaces during cell
culture. These devices present a compelling alternative to conventional
inorganic materials, offering a suite of potential applications in
medicine, pharmacology, and fundamental research.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Silk
Silk fibroin extraction protocols
are detailed elsewhere.43 Briefly, silk
cocoons were cut and boiled for 30 min to extract sericin. Silk fibers
were dissolved in 9.4 M LiBr, dialyzed against deionized water, and
centrifuged to form a clear, 7% solution of extracted fibroin.

Preparation
of Silk Inverse Opals
Silicon wafers were
cleaved and spun with a thin layer of PMMA (495PMMA C, Microchem)
or positive photoresist (S1813). PMMA bead solution (3.5 μL,
250 and 300 nm, Phosphorex) was dropped onto the substrates, which
are subsequently baked on a level hot plate at 85 °C. Reflow
can be induced in structures by additional baking at 95 °C after
this step (1–5 min, depending on the desired level). Silk solution
(7%, doped with BMP-2 or gold nanoparticles) was infiltrated above
PMMA opals and allowed to dry over 24 h to achieve a desired silk
film thickness of 100 μm. After drying, the samples were water-annealed
under vacuum with a vial of water for 4 h and subsequently dropped
in acetone over 24 h to etch the PMMA network. The samples were finally
exchanged to water by slow washing with isopropanol and subsequently
water. The etched inverse opals were stored in 10% ethanol or isopropanol
to prevent bacterial growth. Dry inverse opals were formed by first
transferring the substrates from water into 100% ethanol and finally
critical-point-dried (Tousimis).

Inverse Opal Optical Characterization
The optical response
of the inverse opals was analyzed by a probe spectrometer (USB2000;
Ocean Optics). For aqueous inverse opals, the working solutions were
dropped onto a glass slide, and a single-cut inverse opal was placed
into the solution, covered with a glass coverslip and edges dried.
To prevent evaporation, the coverslip edges were covered with a sized,
square PDMS stencil. The samples were finally held underneath the
probe, and spectra were captured and stored for analysis.

SEM Preparation
Cleaved samples were prepared via cryofracture.
All samples were sputtered with a 10 nm thick layer of gold before
being imaged using a Leica Ultra55 imaging tool.

Protease Degradation
Proteinase K from Tritirachim
album (Sigma), protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus (Sigma), and collagenase (Worthington) stock solutions were prepared
to 400, 50, and 1500 U mL–1, respectively. For time-lapse
protease degradation experiments, 20 μL of proteinase K stock
solution was added at a location close to the silk inverse opal and
imaged using a CCD camera. Working protease concentrations (Proteinase
K: 4 U mL–1, protease XIV: 1× = 2 U mL–1, and collagenase: 1× = 150 U mL–1) were applied to silk inverse opals, and opal spectra were analyzed
over time using the spectrophotometer.

Cell Culture
Mouse
fibroblasts and hMSCs (adipose-derived)
were isolated as described in existing protocols.44 Before cell culture, silk inverse opals were transferred
into 70% ethanol for sterilization and slowly equilibrated to phosphate-buffered
saline over several hours. The samples were finally transferred into
the respective culture medium for 30 min before cell seeding. For
fibroblast cell culture, cells were grown over 48 h before being fixed
in 4% formaldehyde over 15 min. The samples were stained for phalloidin
(Sigma) and imaged by fluorescent microscopy before being transferred
into ethanol for critical-point drying and SEM imaging. For hMSC cultures,
cells attached to silk substrates were grown in osteogenic medium
(Stempro, Invitrogen) for 24 days, with the medium refreshed once
a week. Upon completion of growth, the samples were split and processed
by either: (1) trypsinization for 10 min before cold shock at 4 °C
for 1 h to remove cells and protein or (2) fixation in 4% formaldehyde
over 15 min.

Laser Heating
Gold nanoparticle-doped
samples were
excited using a Nd:YVO4 laser (Verdi V-10, 532 nm) and
characterized using a thermal camera (SC-600, FLIR). The substrates
were allowed to equilibrate over 5 min so that the sample temperature
could be stabilized and imaged.
