Two mononuclear and
one binuclear ytterbium complexes with dual
near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence and reversible trans-to-cis
photoisomerization functions were synthesized and characterized. The
central ytterbium(III) ion coordinates with two β-diketonate
(4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenylbutane-1,3-dionate (tfd)) ligands and one
deprotonated azobenzene-containing tetradentate ligand [(E)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)
benzohydrazide (HL), (E)-4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)diazenyl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide
(HNL), or (E)-4,4′-N′,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide azobenzene
(H2DL)] to form a neutral ternary complex ([Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], or [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)], respectively), where the ytterbium(III) ion is eight-coordinated
to N3O5 donor sets. X-ray crystallographic analysis
shows that all three complexes form a trigonal dodecahedron geometry
with similar −N=N– distances that are slightly
longer than those of the pure azobenzene-containing ligands. The NIR
luminescence properties of the Yb(III) complexes were determined at
a wavelength of about 980 nm with quantum yields in the range of 0.4–0.6%
in ethanol and acetonitrile solutions at room temperature, and trans-to-cis
photoisomerization was determined with the quantum yields (Φt→c = 10–2) at the same level as their
pure ligands. The trans-to-cis photoisomerization rates of the complexes
(10–4 s–1) are slightly higher
than those of the pure ligands and similar to azobenzene (10–5 to 10–4 s–1). From time-dependent
density functional theory calculations of the energy levels of the
first excited triplet states of the ligands, the energies of the lowest
excited triplet states of all of the ligands are higher than the resonance
level of Yb3+ (2F5/2, 1.2722 eV). We suggest
that these azo-containing ligands may participate in energy transfer
to the ytterbium ion, in addition to the main “antenna effect”
ligand tfd. This is the first report of azobenzene group-functionalized
ytterbium complexes with dual NIR luminescence and photoisomerization
properties, indicating that azobenzene-containing lanthanide(III)
complexes have potential applications as dual function materials in
biological systems.

Introduction
It is well-known that
typical organic photochromic compounds, such
as diarylethene, fulgides, spiropyrans, naphthopyrans, and azo compounds,
can be interconverted between two states with different spectroscopic
properties using light, which makes them good candidates for realizing
smart optical modulation.1−7 Integration of photochromic units with luminescent lanthanide components
has potential applications in functional optoelectronic systems and
biological imaging without optical interference.8,9 For
example, the combination of lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles
and diarylethene photoswitches not only has optical memory applications
but can also be modulated with near-infrared (NIR) light, offering
new opportunities in photodynamic therapy.10,11

Among the typical organic photochromic compounds, azobenzene
derivatives
have been extensively studied both in solution and in polymer matrices,
and they are promising for applications in a variety of areas, from
biological science to information technology.12−18 The photochromism mechanism of azobenzene derivatives is because
of trans-to-cis isomerization upon irradiation with ultraviolet (UV)
light and reverse isomerization by irradiation with visible light
or heating.

In recent years, our group has put considerable
effort into developing
photochromism unit azobenzene-attached tris-β-diketonate lanthanide
complexes to investigate the possibility of materials with dual photoluminescence
and photoisomerization functions. Initially, we designed 4,4,5,5,6,6,6-heptafluoro-1-azobenzene-1,3-hexanedione
and its derivative ligands.19 We found
that the coordinated Ln(III) ion enhances the reversible trans-to-cis
isomerization properties of the ligand and remarkably increases its
fatigue resistance without luminescence. We subsequently manipulated
the ligands and designed (E)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) benzohydrazide
lanthanide complexes.20 We detected trans-to-cis
photoisomerization and visible emission of 614 nm from Eu3+ in the complexes in solution. This is remarkable, although it is
not very useful from a practical biological viewpoint, owing to the
strong optical interference generated by the biological samples.21

NIR luminescence of lanthanide complexes,
such as Nd(III), Ho(III),
Er(III), and Yb(III) complexes, is a well-established phenomenon with
wide applications in solid-state laser materials, telecommunication,
and biological systems.22−28 Among these complexes, highly luminescent lanthanide-containing
systems, especially Yb(III) complexes, can be used as probes and labels
for a variety of chemical and biological applications because the
Yb(III) ion exhibits a relatively high quantum efficiency with an
emission wavelength near 1000 nm, which avoids optical interference
from the background and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in biological
tissue applications.10,24,26,29−31 Some Yb(III) complexes
have been tested for photodynamic therapy of cancer and NIR luminescence
localization of tumors.10,32

In our previous
study,19 we investigated
azobenzene-containing Yb(III) complexes but did not capture NIR luminescence
at room temperature, owing to the forbidden nature of their electronic
transitions. In this study, we incorporated the aforementioned tetradentate
ligand into β-diketonate ytterbium complexes to complete the
coordination sphere around the Yb(III) ion and increase the luminescence
intensity. We believe that the newly designed complexes could possess
highly asymmetric eight-coordinate structures to overcome solvent
coordination, allowing efficient energy transfer from the coordinated
ligands to the Yb(III) ion. Mononuclear and binuclear Yb(III) complexes
constructed from two β-diketonate ligands [4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenylbutane-1,3-dionate
(tfd)] and one deprotonated tetradentate ligand bearing an azobenzene
group [(E)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide (HL), (E)-4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)diazenyl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide (HNL), or (E)-4, 4′-N′,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide azobenzene (H2DL)] show NIR luminescence and photo- and thermoisomerization
properties. These features and functions have possible applications
in biological systems.

(DMF) and acetonitrile binary solutions. The molecular geometries
of their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography. The crystallographic data are given in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and
angles of H2DL, [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] are summarized in Table S1. The hydrogen bond parameters are summarized

From the single-crystal structure data (Table 1), it can be seen
that the H2DL
ligand is a monoclinic system with the P21/n space group. The molecule is composed of two para-substituted
bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide groups and a −N=N–
bridge (Figure S1). In the unit cell of
H2DL, the asymmetric unit contains only half a molecule
with an inversion center at the azo bridge and one solvent H2O molecule. Each molecule of H2DL forms hydrogen bonds
with solvent H2O molecules. The N=N double-bond
length is 1.221(3) Å, the C=O double-bond length is 1.209(2)
Å, the C–N bond lengths are in the range 1.300–1.320
Å, and all of the bond lengths are very close to the parameters
for similar known structures.

The [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group with four
molecules in the unit cell. The crystal of complex [Yb(tfd)2L] forms by chelation of two tfd and one deprotonated HL ligand anions.
The tfd ligand chelates to the Yb(III) ion in a normal fashion through
its two oxygen atoms. The L anion chelates to the Yb(III) ion in a
tetradentate fashion by its oxygen atom and three nitrogen atoms from
the bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide group. The coordination
sphere is an eight-coordinated Yb(III) center with a [YbN3O5] coordination environment, forming a trigonal dodecahedron
geometry, as shown in Figure 1. The Yb–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.216(2)–2.272(3)
Å and the Yb–N bond lengths are in the range of 2.490(3)–2.506(3)
Å, which are in agreement with the typical values for previously
reported Yb(III) complexes.19,33 The N=N double-bond
length in [Yb(tfd)2L] is 1.233(5) Å and the C=O
double-bond length in L is 1.279(4) Å, which are slightly longer
than the corresponding distances for the pure H2DL ligand.

hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen bonds are shown) including the
(a) coordination polyhedron geometry of the central Yb(III) ion and
(b) packing in the unit cell.

The [Yb(tfd)2(NL)] complex crystallizes in the
triclinic P1̅ space group, with two molecules
in the unit cell.
The coordination sphere of [Yb(tfd)2(NL)] is the same as
that of [Yb(tfd)2L], with two tfd ligands and one deprotonated
HNL ligand chelating to the Yb(III) center in a trigonal dodecahedron
geometry (Figure S2). The Yb–O bond
lengths are in the range of 2.215(3)–2.288(3) Å and the
Yb–N bond lengths vary from 2.492(3) to 2.530(3) Å, which
are also reasonable ranges. The N=N double-bond length in [Yb(tfd)2(NL)] is 1.282(5) Å and the C=O double-bond length
in L is 1.279(4) Å, which are also a little longer than the corresponding
distances for the pure H2DL ligand.

The [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex also crystallizes
in the triclinic P1̅ space group. The asymmetric
unit contains two complex molecules, with each molecule composed of
two Yb(III) ions, four tfd anion ligands, and one DL anion ligand,
and two DMF molecules. The coordination environment of each Yb(III)
center is the same as those of [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb(tfd)2(NL)]. The coordination sphere of each Yb(III) ion in [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] has a trigonal dodecahedron geometry
(Figure 2). The Yb–O
bond lengths vary from 2.227(3) to 2.332(4) Å and the Yb–N
bond lengths are in the range of 2.445(4)–2.490(4) Å.
The N=N double-bond lengths of [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] are 1.245(8) and 1.231(8) Å and C=O double-bond
lengths of L are 1.269(6) and 1.282(6) Å, which are similar to
those of the [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb(tfd)2(NL)]
complexes. The similar ranges of the N=N and C=O distances
are presumably because the ligands of [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] are the “same,”
except for the p-dimethylamino substituent on the
NL ligand.

Thermal Analysis of the [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] Complexes
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the [Yb(tfd)2L],
[Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)]
complexes was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature
range of 30–870 °C for powder samples. As seen in Figure 3, the TGA plots show
that the [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes exhibit a similar thermal
decomposition process. Below 260 °C, the three complexes do not
decompose. The first decomposition stage occurs in the temperature
range of 260–280 °C with mass losses of 21.04, 19.25,
and 22.23% for the [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)],
and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes, respectively.
The mass loss percentages are in conformity with the material decomposition
and elimination of one tfd ligand for complexes [Yb(tfd)2L] (theoretically calculated value 20.99%) and [Yb(tfd)2(NL)] (20.14%) and two tfd ligands for the complex [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] (23.04%). Upon further heating, the complexes
continue decomposing until 380 °C. The complexes then gradually
reach constant masses at 870 °C. From the thermal analysis, it
can be seen that the tfd ligand is more easily dropped down from the
complexes than the L, NL, and DL ligands, confirming that the designed
HL, HNL, and H2DL ligands are excellent coordinating tetradentate
ligands for lanthanide ions (Scheme 1).

and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedures for Preparation of the Ligands
and Complexes
Photoisomerization Behavior
of H2DL in Ethanol and
Acetonitrile Solutions
The photoisomerization behavior of
the HL and HNL ligands has been investigated in detail by our group.
The results show that the photoisomerization quantum yield (Φt→c) of HL is less than that of substituted azobenzenes,
such as 4-methoxy-4′-nitroazobenzene and 2,4,6-trimethylazobenzene.
The para electron-donating N,N-dimethylamino
group in HNL produces a drastic change in absorption, and overall,
it is unfavorable for the photoisomerization properties of azobenzene
in the molecule. We are curious about the photoisomerization properties
of azobenzene that are affected by two para-substituted bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide
groups. Hence, the symmetric aromatic azo compound H2DL
was synthesized by oxidative dimerization of the aromatic amines by tert-butylhypoiodite at room temperature according to the
Minakata method.34 The photoisomerization
properties of H2DL were investigated and compared with
those of HL and HNL.

Figure 4 shows the changes in the absorption spectrum of H2DL upon UV irradiation at 365 nm and visible-light irradiation
at 450 nm with time in ethanol solution. From Figure 4, the UV–visible (UV–vis) absorption
spectrum of the ligand H2DL shows a broad strong π–π*
transition band at 332 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient (ε)
of 3.48 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1 and two other intense absorption bands at 261 (ε = 2.09 ×
104 L mol–1 cm–1) and
265 nm (ε = 1.78 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1). When the spectrum is enlarged (Figure S3), there is a very weak n−π*
transition band of the azo group in the range of 400–500 nm.
When the solution is irradiated by 365 nm UV light, the intensity
of the π–π* absorption band at 332 nm gradually
decreases with increasing irradiation time, whereas the absorbance
bands at 261 and 265 nm increase with an isosbestic point at 289 nm.
Because of the extremely weak n−π* transition band of
the azo group, it is very difficult to observe the change in the absorption
of the weak n−π* forbidden transition. The spectral change
can still indicate transformation of the trans form of H2DL to the cis form. A photostable state is reached when the solution
is irradiated for 10 min. With subsequent irradiation of the solution
with 450 nm visible light, the intensity of the broad π–π*
absorption band sharply increases in the first 5 s and remains unchanged
after 2 min, finally leading to 75% recovery of the absorption spectrum.
Owing to the special symmetrical structure of H2DL, the
cis form of H2DL is very unstable, and it can rapidly transform
to the stable trans form upon exposure to visible light. This spectral
change reversibly and repeatedly occurs. The absorption intensity
of the peak at 332 nm did not change when 10 cycles of irradiation
with 365 nm UV light and 450 nm visible light were performed (Figure S4). The photoisomerization reaction of
H2DL in acetonitrile solution was also investigated, and
the reaction was similar to that in ethanol solution (Figures S5 and S6).
The first-order rate constants (ks) of
the photoisomerization reaction of H2DL in ethanol and
acetonitrile solutions at 365 nm irradiation wavelength were calculated
to be 2.0 × 10–3 and 1.3 × 10–3 s–1, respectively, using a previously reported
method.19 These data are at the same level
as those of HL and HNL and slightly higher than those of azobenzene
and its derivatives (10–5 to 10–4 s–1). The estimated photoreaction quantum yields
(Φt→c) are 0.015 in ethanol and 0.012 in acetonitrile,
which are slightly less than those of HL and HNL and less than those
of substituted azobenzenes, such as 4-methoxy-4′-nitroazobenzene
and 2,4,6-trimethylazobenzene.20,35,36 These data are given in Table 2.

Photoisomerization Behavior of the [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] Complexes
in Ethanol and Acetonitrile Solutions
The [Yb(tfd)2L] complex shows similar spectral changes in ethanol and acetonitrile
solutions upon irradiation with 365 or 450 nm light. Figure 5 shows the typical spectral
change of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in ethanol solution upon
irradiation with 365 nm UV light and its recoverable spectrum after
irradiation with 450 nm visible light. The π–π*
absorption band of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in ethanol solution
has a peak at 329 nm and the weak n−π* absorption band
has a peak at 449 nm (Figure 5). When the ethanol solution of the [Yb(tfd)2L]
complex is irradiated with 365 nm UV light, a band appears at 449
nm at the expense of the original band at 329 nm, which has two isosbestic
points located at 283 and 389 nm. This spectral change indicates that
the azo group of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex undergoes reversible
photoisomerization in solution. The [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
reaches a photostable state after 30 min of irradiation at 365 nm,
and 61% of the compound returns to the trans form when the UV irradiation
is changed to 450 nm visible light for 4 s. The recovery percentage
of the trans form is lower than that of the pure HL ligand but similar
to that of other HL-functionalized lanthanide complexes.20 The stability of trans–cis–trans
photoisomerization was then investigated. Ten cycles were performed
by irradiating the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in ethanol solution
with 365 nm light for 30 min followed by 450 nm light for 2 min. As
shown in Figure 6,
there are no signs of photodegradation. This indicates that the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex is stable under these conditions. The spectral
changes of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in acetonitrile solution
upon irradiation with 365 nm UV light and its recoverable spectrum
after irradiation with 450 nm visible light are similar to those in
ethanol solution, as shown in Figures S7 and S8. The reversible isomerization
reaction for more than 10 cycles shows the excellent fatigue resistance
and reversibility of the photoisomerization process of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex.

Figure 5 UV–vis spectral change of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
in ethanol solution (2.0 × 10–5 mol/L) upon
irradiation at 365 nm and recoverable irradiation at 450 nm as a function
of time.

Figure 6 UV–vis spectral changes of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
in ethanol solution (2.0 × 10–5 mol/L) upon
irradiation with UV light at 365 nm and visible light at 450 nm. The
inset shows the maximum absorption intensity for 10 cycles of alternating
irradiation with UV light at 365 nm and visible light at 450 nm.

The first-order kinetics rate
constants of the photoisomerization
reaction of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in ethanol and acetonitrile
solutions were calculated to be 3.8 × 10–3 and
4.5 × 10–3 s–1, and the quantum
yields were calculated to be 0.046 and 0.035 (Table 2), respectively, which are similar to those
of the pure HL ligand and our previous reported azobenzene-containing
lanthanide complexes.

Compared with the observed photoisomerization
properties of the
[Yb(tfd)2L] complex, the quantum yield and photoisomerization
rate constants of [Yb(tfd)2NL] in solution are slightly
smaller owing to the para electron-donating dimethylamino group substituent
in the NL ligand. As shown in Figure S9, the UV–vis spectra of complex [Yb(tfd)2NL] in
different solvents exhibit trends similar to those of other HNL-containing
lanthanide complexes. The π–π* absorption bands
of the [Yb(tfd)2NL] complex are at 326 and 421 nm in ethanol
solution and at 324 and 428 nm in acetonitrile solution. In addition,
the forbidden symmetry of the n−π* transition band of
the azo group is not present in either spectrum. Upon 365 nm UV light
irradiation, both of the π–π* maximum absorption
intensities decrease. After the photostable state is reached and the
sample is irradiated with 450 nm light, the intensities of the both
the π–π* bands increase. However, the quantum yield
of photoisomerization of the [Yb(tfd)2NL] complex is much
smaller than those of HL and the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex, owing
to the para electron-donating dimethylamino group substituent.

The UV–vis spectra of the [Yb2(tfd)4DL] complex are the sum of the absorption spectra of the H2DL and 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenylbutane-1,3-dione (Htfd) ligands, similar
to the spectral form of H2DL (Figure S3). In ethanol solution, there is a strong π–π*
transition absorption peak at 332 nm and a weak n−π*
transition absorption peak at 451 nm. The molar absorption coefficient
of the complex (ε332 = 1.04 × 105 L mol–1 cm–1) is 3 times that
of the ligand, mainly because of the coordination effect of the metal
ion. The photoisomerization properties of the complex are typical
but slightly different from those of the mononuclear [Yb(tfd)2L] complex (see Figures S10–S13). The quantum yield of photoisomerization is much smaller than that
of the mononuclear [Yb(tfd)2L] complex, and it is also
smaller than that of the pure H2DL ligand. The rate constants
of photoisomerization are at the same level as the [Yb(tfd)2NL] complex in ethanol and acetonitrile solutions (Table 2). This may be because of the
large spatial steric hindrance at both ends of the azo group by coordination
to the ytterbium ion.

Photoisomerization Behavior of H2DL and the [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] Complexes in
Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) Films
The switching speed
of trans-to-cis or cis-to-trans isomerization is the most rapid in
solution and the slowest in a rigid environment, such as a polymer.37 Similar to our previously studied lanthanide
complexes doped in PMMA,19,20 the photoisomerization
properties of the H2DL ligand and [Yb(tfd)2L]
and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes doped in PMMA
films were investigated (Figure S14). The
change of the UV–vis spectrum of H2DL in PMMA upon
irradiation with UV or visible light shows a trend similar to that
in solution, although the extent of trans-to-cis photoisomerization
is low. Upon 365 nm UV light irradiation, the intensity of the π–π*
transition absorption peak at 332 nm gradually decreases. The photostable
state is reached after about 20 min. With subsequent irradiation with
450 nm visible light, the intensity of the π–π*
transition absorption band rapidly increases in the first 5 s and
then slowly increases to a constant value with prolonged irradiation
time. The first-order rate constant of the photoisomerization reaction
of H2DL in PMMA is 1.2 × 10–2 s–1, which is higher than that in solution.

The
UV–vis spectral changes of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
in a PMMA film upon photoirradiation are shown in Figure S14b–d. The absorption spectrum of [Yb(tfd)2L] in the PMMA film shows the characteristic π–π*
absorption band at 331 nm and a weak n−π* absorption
band at 447 nm. With irradiation at 365 nm, the photostable state
is reached in only 15 min. The trans-to-cis first-order reaction rate
constant for the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex in the PMMA film was
determined to be 7.4 × 10–3 s–1, which is higher than that in solution and for the ligand HL itself.
When 365 nm UV light irradiation is stopped, 95% of the cis form returns
to the trans form with 450 nm light irradiation for 5 s. The recovery
extent of the trans form by visible light indicates that the photochemical
pathway of the [Yb(tfd)2L] complex is similar to that in
solution and for the HL ligand. In addition, for 10 cycles of alternating
irradiation with UV light at 365 nm and visible light at 450 nm, the
[Yb(tfd)2L] complex shows no photodegradation in PMMA (Figure S15).

The [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex in PMMA shows
the same UV–vis absorption variation as in solution. Upon continuous
365 nm UV light irradiation, the characteristic π–π*
transition absorption band gradually decreases, whereas the n−π*
transition absorption band variation is not obvious because of the
low intensity. When 365 nm UV light is changed to 450 nm visible light,
the π–π* transition intensity gradually increases.
This shows that the [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex
is capable of reversible trans–cis–trans isomerization
in the PMMA film. In addition, because of the poor solubility of the
complex, reversible photoisomerization in the PMMA film decreases
with increasing cycling number by alternating light irradiation (365
nm UV and 450 nm visible light) (Figure S16). The linearity of the first-order kinetic photoisomerization behavior
is not ideal, so the photoisomerization rate constant in PMMA was
not determined.

Thermal Cis-to-Trans Isomerization of the
H2DL Ligand
and [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)]
Complexes
Azobenzene and its derivatives are sensitive to
light-triggered trans-to-cis and cis-to-trans isomerization. Cis-to-trans
isomerization can also spontaneously occur in the dark.38,39 Normally, after azobenzene derivatives are irradiated with UV light
for a certain time, they begin to revert to the transisomer after
standing in the dark. Cis-to-trans thermal isomerization occurs on
the order of hours to days for azobenzenes and seconds to milliseconds
for pseudo-stilbenes.38,40 Cis-to-trans thermal isomerization
of the [Yb(tfd)2NL] complex is not sensitive to the dark
even at high temperature, so only the first-order rate constants and
half-lives of H2DL and the [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes were determined. Thermal
cis-to-trans isomerization was also investigated at 50 °C. The
calculated first-order rate constants (k) and half-lives
(τ1/2) at 25 and 50 °C are given in Table 3. A representative
example of thermal cis-to-trans isomerization of the [Yb2(tfd)4(L)] complex in ethanol solution is shown in Figure 7. At 25 °C,
the rates of cis-to-trans thermal isomerization of H2DL
and the [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes in solution are very slow. The half-lives of the
cis isomers of H2DL, [Yb(tfd)2L], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] are higher than at about 85 days in
solution, indicating that the cis isomers are stable at 25 °C
in the dark. Thermal isomerization of azobenzene and azobenzene derivatives
becomes faster by increasing the temperature, and higher cis-to-trans
isomerization rate constants are obtained at a higher temperature.
At 50 °C, the first-order rate constants for cis-to-trans thermal
isomerization of H2DL, [Yb(tfd)2L], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] in solution are similar to those of
similar azobenzene-containing lanthanide complexes and higher than
those of other azobenzene-containing metal complexes.41,42

Thermal
cis-to-trans isomerization of both the ligands and their
complexes in ethanol solution was investigated as a function of temperature
(Figure S17). The results show that the
rates of thermal isomerization of the Yb(III) complexes are almost
the same as those of the pure ligands. For example, at 70 °C
for 15 min, the pure HL and H2DL ligands achieve 71 and
87% cis-to-trans reversal, whereas their Yb(III) complexes [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] achieve 68 and
86% reversal, respectively. This indicates that the thermal isomerization
pathway in these Yb(III) complexes is simple and similar to that of
the free azobenzene ligands.

NIR Photoluminescence Properties of the [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2NL], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] Complexes
Recently, NIR-based emission ytterbium(III)
complexes have attracted interest because of their potential applications
in laser systems, light-emitting diodes, and medical imaging for bioscience.11,24,26,30,31,43−47 NIR emission from Yb3+ (980 nm) has efficient transmission
in biological tissues owing to NIR light ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 μm
having little interference with biomaterials. Our previous report
shows that such azo-containing lanthanide complexes can emit luminescence
because the excitation energy of tfd can be transferred to the rare
earth ion, owing to the triplet state of the ligand being higher than
the resonance level of the rare earth ion, although the azo-containing
ligand does not participate in energy transfer to the lanthanide ion
because of its lower triplet-state energy levels. The three [Yb(tfd)2L], [Yb(tfd)2NL], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complexes have relatively strong NIR luminescence properties
in aerated solutions at room temperature. The energy of the excited
triplet state of the H2DL ligand was calculated by time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP) hybrid exchange–correlation functional and 6-31+G(d)
basis set using the Gaussian 09 program. The lowest excited triplet
state of the H2DL ligand is 1.7498 eV, which is the lowest
energy among the ligands but still higher than the resonance level
of Yb3+ (2F5/2, 1.2722 eV). It is well-known
that there is no report on the optimum energy gap for an efficient
energy transfer from organic ligands to the Yb(III) ion.48−50 Because the absorption spectra of tfd and azo-containing ligands
seriously overlap around 310 nm, the tfd ligand is well-known for
being an “antenna ligand” in lanthanide complexes.20 Thus, these azo-containing ligands may have
the chance to participate in energy transfer to the lanthanide ion,
as shown in Figure 8. Furthermore, the NIR luminescence intensity of the three Yb3+ complexes does not change upon 365 nm UV light irradiation
as a function of time (Figure S19). These
Yb3+ complexes are the first examples of azo-group-containing
complexes showing NIR emission.

Figure 8 Energy level of the first excited triplet
states of the ligands
and the related levels of the ytterbium ion.

The characteristic luminescence emission spectra of the Yb3 + complexes were recorded in the NIR region under excitation
by 310 nm UV light in different solvents (Figures 9 and S18). The
NIR luminescence of the three Yb3+ complexes has a sharp
line emission at about 980 nm, corresponding to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition. It is
noted that the appearances of another two broad bands centered at
1012 (or 1018) and 1048 (or 1053) nm attributed to the Stark splitting
of the crystal field.51 For the [Yb(tfd)2L] and [Yb(tfd)2NL] complexes, the emission bands
are centered at 976, 1012, and 1048 nm, and the slight red shifts
of the bands at 981, 1018, and 1053 nm for the [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex are because of the two metal centers. The NIR
emission for the binuclear [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex
is more intense than for the mononuclear complex with the same number
of ligands because there are two emissive metal centers in the binuclear
complex compared with only one in the mononuclear complex. The solvent
does not affect the luminescence emission spectral shapes of the Yb3+ complexes, but it does affect the emission peak intensities.
The intensity of luminescence is slightly higher in acetonitrile solution
than in ethanol solution. The trans-to-cis isomerization behavior
of the azobenzene group does not affect the luminescence intensities
of the complexes.

Figure 9 NIR luminescence spectra of the [Yb(tfd)2L],
[Yb(tfd)2(NL)], and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)]
complexes
(λex = 310 nm) in acetonitrile solution (2.0 ×
10–5 mol/L).

To better understand the NIR luminescence of the three complexes,
the time-resolved luminescence decay responses in the NIR region were
measured by the time-correlated single photon counting technique.
The NIR luminescence decay curves of the complexes in ethanol and
acetonitrile solutions were measured at room temperature (λex = 310 nm). The emission decay curves were well-fitted by
a single-exponential function to obtain the luminescence lifetimes
(Table 4 and Figure S20). The intrinsic luminescence quantum
yield of the Yb3+ ions can be estimated by Φ = τobs/τ0, where τobs is the
observed emission lifetime and τ0 is the natural
lifetime (2.0 ms for the Yb3+ ion).52,53 The maximum estimated NIR quantum yields of the three complexes
are in the range of 0.4–0.6% (Table 4). NIR luminescence emission from these complexes
is similar to that for other reported Yb3+ complexes.53,54 These complexes will be good dual function materials in biological
system applications, such as controlling the DNA morphology to regulate
the biological processes.

Conclusions
We have synthesized
novel ternary β-diketonate mononuclear
ytterbium complexes of HL and HNL and binuclear ytterbium complex
of H2DL and structurally characterized. The X-ray crystal
structures show that the Yb(III) ions in all three complexes are eight-coordinated
to four oxygen atoms of the two β-diketonate ligands and one
oxygen atom and three nitrogen atoms of the deprotonated ligand from
HL, HNL, or H2DL, forming a trigonal dodecahedron geometry
with similar ranges of −N=N– distances. Among
the complexes, only the mononuclear [Yb(tfd)2L] complex
can undergo reversible and easily observable trans-to-cis photoisomerization
in different organic solvents and in a solid PMMA film. The mononuclear
[Yb(tfd)2NL] complex-attached azobenzene groups with a
donor substituent and the binuclear [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] complex both show small photoisomerization quantum yields.
A thermal isomerization study of the complexes shows that the thermal
isomerization pathway in these Yb(III) complexes is simple and similar
to that of the free azobenzene ligands. All three Yb3+ complexes
show NIR emission in aerated solutions at room temperature. They are
the first examples of azo-group-containing complexes showing NIR emission.
The [Yb(tfd)2L] complex with dual photoisomerization and
NIR luminescence functions has potential applications as a smart material
in biological systems.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
YbCl3·6H2O was purchased from Jinan
Camolai Trading Company (Jinan,
China). Analytical grade Htfd and PMMA were purchased from Alfa Aesar
and used as received. The analytical grade solvents were redistilled
before use. The melting points were determined with an X-4 micromelting
point apparatus without correction. The electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry data were acquired with a Bruker ESQUIRE-3000 Plus LC-MS/MS
spectrometer. The elemental analyses were carried out with a Vario
EL III elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra (KBr pellets) were
recorded with a Nicolet AVATAR FT-IR 330 spectrometer. The solution
proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were
recorded at 400 MHz with a Bruker ADVANCE 400 spectrometer at 25 °C.
The chemical shifts (ppm) were measured using tetramethylsilane as
the internal reference. TGA was performed with a SDTQ 600 thermogravimeter
under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu
UV224012PC absorption spectrometer. The NIR photoluminescence spectra
and lifetimes were determined with an Edinburgh instruments FLS980
fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a Hamamatsu R5509 NIR photomultiplier
tube, and the emission and excitation slits were set to 2 and 5 nm,
respectively. PMMA thin film preparation and the photoisomerization
quantum yield (ϕ) measurements were the same, as previously
reported.19 The 365 nm UV light was produced
with a Shanghai Yihui ZF-2 UV analyzer. The 450 nm visible light was
produced with a 300 W PLS-SXE300CUV Xe lamp and isolated by a sharp
cut filter. The thermal recoverable experiments were performed by
placing a 1 cm cuvette in the thermostated cell of a spectrophotometer,
and the spectrum was measured as a function of temperature. The temperature
error was controlled to ±1 °C. The DFT calculations were
executed with the three-parameterized B3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation
functional and 6-31+G(d) basis set using the Gaussian 09 program.
At the optimized geometry, the low-lying singlet as well as the triplet
excitation energies were calculated by TD-DFT using the same basis
set without considering the solvent effect.

(HL) and (E)-4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)diazenyl)-N,N-bis (pyridin-2-ylmethyl)benzohydrazide
(HNL) were synthesized and characterized, according to our previous
report.20

Azobenzene (H2DL)
H2DL was synthesized
from (E)-4,4′-benzohydrazide azobenzene and
2-(chloromethyl)pyridine hydrochloride. (E)-4,4′-Benzohydrazide
azobenzene (0.06 g, 0.2 mmol) and 2-(chloromethyl)pyridine hydrochloride
(0.20 g, 1.2 mmol) were dissolved in 10.0 mL of absolute ethanol and
heated to 80 °C. To this solution, 12.0 mL of 0.2 mol/L NaOH
aqueous solution was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was
refluxed for 12 h. During the reaction, a yellow precipitate was formed,
and the solution was then cooled to room temperature. The yellow solid
product was filtered and washed with water, followed by ethanol/water
(1:1). H2DL was obtained as a pure pale yellow powder (yield
89%). Mp 198–200 °C; ESI(+)-MS (m/z, methanol): 685.3 [M + Na+]; 1H

General Procedures
All three complexes
were synthesized
by the same method. HL (HNL or H2DL) (0.25 mmol) and Htfd
(0.162 g, 0.75 mmol) were added to 15.0 mL of absolute ethanol. The
reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 80 °C. To this solution,
0.75 mL of 1.0 mmol/L NaOH aqueous solution was added dropwise in
10 min. YbCl3·6H2O (0.25 mmol) in deionized
water (5 mL) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred
for an additional 10 h at 80 °C. The precipitate appeared after
cooling. The crude product was filtered and washed with 30.0 mL, 1:1
water/ethanol several times and dried under reduced pressure to give
a pure powder. Crystals of the complexes suitable for X-ray analysis
were obtained by slow evaporation from a mixed solution of DMF and
acetonitrile for about 1 month.

Structure Determination
of H2DL, [Yb(tfd)2L],[Yb(tfd)2(NL)],
and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] by X-ray Diffraction
The single-crystal data of H2DL, [Yb(tfd)2(NL)],
and [Yb2(tfd)4(DL)] were collected on a Bruker
SMART Apex CCD diffractometer
using graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
radiation at 173(2) K. Data integration and reduction were performed
with SAINT software, and the absorption correction was applied to
the data by the SADABS program.55 The data
for [Yb(tfd)2L] were collected on an Oxford Gemini S Ultra
CCD area detector at 173(2) K. Absorption correction was applied using
the multiscan CrysAlis Red program.56 All
of the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix
least-squares calculations based on F2 using the SHELXTL-2014 software package.57 All of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The
hydrogen atoms were placed in their calculated positions and included
as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters of 1.5 times Ueq (the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter)
of the attached C atoms.
