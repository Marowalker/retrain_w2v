Nowadays, humidity
sensors have become essential in numerous applications.
However, there are several problems while using them for humidity
detection, such as low sensitivity, delayed response and recovery
times, less stability, and narrow humidity detection ranges. Here,
we demonstrate for the first time a highly sensitive chemiresistive
sensor for low-level humidity detection in ambient atmosphere by introducing
graphene oxide (GO) and doped GO (Li-doped GO and B-doped GO) as a
thin film in a facile manner. The sensitivity, repeatability, and
stability studies show that thin film-based fabricated humidity sensors
are unprecedently efficient in the detection of different percentages
of humidity from 11 to 97% at room temperature. The incorporation
of doping into GO induces a dramatic change in the sensing behavior
of the base film (undoped GO). This allows the sensor to be used in
a variety of applications such as humidity sensing, which we validate
through our experiment with a “cheap and readily available”
recognition system.

1 Introduction
Sensors
act as an automated device to make a correlation between
the digital and physical worlds, having a unique performance that
can create new applications and ways for better operator interaction.1 Several types of sensors are used to explain
and solve numerous problems in electronic devices such as temperature
sensor, gas sensor, touch sensor, light sensor, and humidity sensor.

Portable, reliable, and low-cost humidity sensors play an important
role in our day-to-day life, including industry, agriculture, environmental
fields,2 and medical devices.3 To maintain an optimal environment, it is essential
to have a suitable humidity sensor that can detect and control the
ambient environment under different conditions including the rise
and fall of temperature or mixtures of various gases precisely and
providently.4 Generally, humidity is measured in two ways:
it is measured by a change in resistance with respect to the variation
in relative humidity (RH) (resistive-type humidity sensor) or it is
measured by capacitance variation due to RH (capacitive-type humidity
sensor). Resistive-type humidity sensors are used generally for conductive
sensing materials and highly moisture-sensitive materials. On the
other hand, capacitive humidity sensors are used for nonconducting
materials. So far, a lot of efforts have been made to develop high-performance
humidity sensors using various transduction techniques such as capacitance,5 resistance,6 optical
fiber,7 and various electronic devices.8−10 Furthermore, several kinds of sensing materials have been used in
humidity sensors, such as polymers,11 metal
oxide,12 carbon nanotubes,13 and composites,14,15 but they have their
own advantages and specific conditions of application. Some researchers
have also used N-doped carbon spheres dispersed with a cationic surfactant
in poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix sensors, which present an exponential
dependence of the conductance on RH (RH varies from 9 to 97%), with
the conductance varying 4 orders of magnitude with varying RH.16 Also, graphene oxide (GO) has aroused tremendous
interest for various sensing applications mainly due to its wide accessibility,
ease of synthesis and solution processability, high chemical stability,
and adaptable properties.17 GO has also
proven to be a potential candidate for water purification and humidity
sensors.18 Generally, these electrical-type
GO-based humidity sensors exhibit low conductivity because of the
interruption of the conjugated electronic state in GO and are less
moisture sensitive in nature. Conductivity may be partially restored
by using reduced GO (rGO), but it is far behind that of pristine graphene.19 Therefore, developing a novel humidity sensor
based on GO by using its unique structure and chemical properties
while avoiding its drawback is highly desired.20 Researchers have found better sensitivity and response
and recovery times for GO as a capacitive-type sensor but not as a
resistive-type sensor. Moreover, these sensors are quite expensive
and not readily available. Therefore, to overcome this problem, our
main aim is to modify GO with lithium (Li) and boron (B) doping. We
think that a small amount (<1%) of Li and B insertion as dopant
or impurity can change various properties such as moisture sensitivity,
reliability, and conductivity of the materials. However, for Li-doped
and B-doped GO, information about the effect of doping toward the
humidity sensor is scarce. Till now, a few reports in the literature
have been found on the use of Li-doped and B-doped graphene on some
applications21−23 but none on humidity sensors.

Therefore, we
presume that the present research can answer these
questions, clarifying the effect of Li and B doping (<1% of dopant)
on GO and stimulating new experimental research about the suitability
of doped GO for resistive-type humidity sensors in terms of better
sensitivity and low response time. Thus, in this paper, we have mainly
focused on humidity on a single analyte.
Therefore, in this research, we try to explore its potential for future
humidity-sensing applications.

2 Results and Discussion
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO, Li-GO, and B-GO
(Figure 1) show a broad
peak at 3420.37, 3430.84, and 3420.97 cm–1, respectively,
in the high-frequency area corresponding to the vibration for the
stretching and bending of OH groups present in the adsorbed water
molecules by undoped and doped GO. Therefore, from this observation,
it can be concluded that the sample has strong hydrophilicity for
both undoped and doped GO. The absorption peaks at 2363.37, 2363.38,
and 2360.48 cm–1 are observed because of the symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of CH2 for GO,
B-GO, and Li-GO, respectively. Also, C–OH stretching is found
at 1386.10 cm–1 for undoped GO, 1391.69 cm–1 for B-GO, and 1398.24 cm–1 for Li-GO corresponding
to the stretching vibration of C–OH of alcohol. Again, C–O–C
groups are found at 1227.15 cm–1 for undoped GO,
1212.48 cm–1 for B-GO, and 1268.36 cm–1 for Li-doped GO.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of undoped GO, Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO.

The two absorption peaks found
in the middle of the frequency area
for GO at 1736.39 and 1624.42 cm–1 can be accredited
to the stretching vibrations of C=O and C=C of carbonyl
groups and carboxylic acid, respectively, present at the edges of
GO. The peak at 1067.42 cm–1 corresponds to the
stretching vibration of C–O due to the presence of carboxylic
acid. The presence of these oxygen-containing groups confirms that
GO has been produced. The formation of hydrogen bonds between carbon
and water molecules occurs as a result of the presence of hydroxyl
groups, which further elucidates the hydrophilic nature of GO.24

After the doping of boron in GO, the peaks
at 626.88 and 1098.69
cm–1 are due to the stretching vibrations of the
O–B–O and the B–C bonds, respectively, confirming
the presence of boron in the graphene structure.25 Moreover, for Li-doped GO, a peak is found at 3732.13 cm–1, which corresponds to the Li–OH stretching.
Also, two peaks in the middle of the frequency area at 1591.06 and
1111.23 cm–1 are found, which clearly proves the
presence of Li in GO. The absence of a peak at 1736.39 cm–1 for both Li-doped GO and B-doped GO is attributed to the metal leakage
with the carboxylic group. From FTIR, it is clearly observed that
the oxygen-containing groups have not been fully removed at the time
of doping, which confirms that the full reduction of GO does not take
place.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared GO
shows an
interlayer spacing of 0.801, 0.336, and 0.211 nm for the (001) reflection
peak at 2θ = 11.04°, 26.54°, and 42.22° (Figure 2), respectively.
The large interlayer gaps of GO sheets prove the presence of oxygen-containing
groups introduced by the oxidation of graphite.26

Figure 2 XRD spectra of the prepared samples.

From the graph, it can be found that the disappearance of
the XRD
peak at 11.04° is due to the Li doping in GO, which caused the
distortion of the graphitic structure. This reflection corresponding
to (001) is of LiC6. This (001) of LiC6 confirms
the intercalation of lithium into the graphitic structure, which confirms
doping. The XRD peak at 42.96° (100) shows an interlayer spacing
of 0.214 nm that corresponds to the disorder in the graphitic structure,
which still remains after doping.

The (002) reflection peak
at 2θ = 26.92° shows an interlayer
spacing of B-doped GO, which is approximately 0.332 nm, and is slightly
lower than the (002) graphite spacing of 0.336 nm. It shows that the
sample has a structure similar to that of graphite, with less defects
caused by boron doping.27

The surface
morphologies of the prepared samples are shown in Figure 3. FESEM images of
the undoped GO shows well-defined, layered, and interlinked three-dimensional
homogeneous graphene sheets, forming a spongelike porous network structure.
From Figure 3a, it
is easy to differentiate the number of individual layers, including
the kinked and wrinkled areas. Figure 3b shows the morphology of the Li-doped GO. FESEM shows
a small, white, dotlike structure, which confirms the presence of
lithium in GO. From Figure 3c, the morphology of B-doped GO can be seen to have the same
type of normal exfoliated structure as GO.
Some researchers observed that the doping of smaller-sized boron atoms
into GO results in some twisting effect of the doped GO sheet around
the boron atoms.25 This is possible due
to the compressive force generated at the time of substitutional doping.

emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the
prepared samples: (a) undoped GO, (b) Li-doped GO, and (c) B-doped
GO.

TGA provides the physical or chemical
properties (%wt loss) of
the material as a function of increasing temperature or time. The
TGA curves of GO show the typical two-step degradation as the temperature
is increased (Figure 4). From the differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves, it can be
observed that the weight loss that starts below 100 °C is mainly
due to the release of hydrate water from the GO sheets and that the
distinct weight loss at 205.3 °C is due to the breakdown of less-stable
oxygen-containing groups on GO sheets.28 If the temperature is further increased up to 636 °C, mass
loss occurs because of the decomposition of more-stable functional
groups. Nearly identical TGA curves are observed for both Li-doped
GO and B-doped GO samples. For Li-doped GO and B-doped GO, above than
850 °C nearly 20% residue has been obtained. Also, for Li-doped
GO, it shows the maximum stability by the removal of more-stable functional
groups at 794.4 °C.

analysis (TGA) analysis of the prepared samples.

Raman spectrometry is an appropriate tool to examine the
disordered/doped
materials. The Raman spectrum
provides clear evidence for the fractionary stage, owing to the very
weak intensity of (h k l), whereas this phase would
be difficult to detect from the XRD peaks.

The first- and second-order
Raman spectra of undoped GO, Li-doped
GO, and B-doped GO are shown in Figure 5. As can be seen from Figure 5, a D-band is observed at 1358 cm–1 for the undoped GO flakes because of the (weak) disordered band
of the graphite edges (D-band) and can be attributed to the breathing
motion of sp2 atoms in the rings of carbon and defects
in the graphene flakes.29 This band position
generally gives the sensitivity with respect to the applied strain,
temperature, and the level of doping. However, for Li-doped GO and
B-doped GO, the D-band is observed at 1345 and 1351 cm–1, respectively. It shows that the peaks have been shifted (blue shift)
13 and 7 cm–1 for Li and B, respectively, because
of the loss of some quanta by interacting with the
vibrational modes of the material called phonons. The peak around
1595 cm–1 is called the G-band (E2g2)
of GO. The G mode is formed because of the relative motion of sp2 carbon atoms in rings and in chains. For Li-doped GO and
B-doped GO, the peaks are observed at 1582 cm—1 and
1588 cm–1, respectively. From this figure, it can
be found that the intensity of the D-band is increased and that both
D- and G-bands are broadened for Li-doped GO and B-doped GO, which
confirms the incorporation of oxygen-containing groups. Simultaneously,
it also gives information about the decrease in the crystalline nature
as compared with graphite.30 Second-order
D-band (2D-band), as a result of two phonon vibrational processes,
occurs at 2899, 2896, and 2913 cm–1 for GO, Li-doped
GO, and B-doped GO, respectively. However, the red shift is observed
for B-doped GO because of the decrease in the frequency of phonons
interacting with the incident photon.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of the prepared samples.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis for undoped GO,
Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO was carried out with the binding energy
ranging from 0 to 1100 eV to study the elemental composition (qualitative
and quantitative analyses of functional groups) of the material. The
survey spectrum in Figure 6 shows the presence of carbon and oxygen for undoped GO, carbon
and lithium for Li-doped GO, and carbon and boron for B-doped GO.

Figure 6 XPS spectra
of (a) undoped GO, (b) Li-doped GO, and (c) B-doped
GO.

The C1 spectrum
generally shows four types of functional groups for undoped GO: C–H/C=C
(∼284.6 eV), O–C–O (∼286.72 eV), C=O
(∼288.02 eV), and O=C–O (∼288.94 eV).
However, we have not found any O=C–OH groups, which
may be due to their short-lived existence during the deconvolution
of C1s.
The deconvolution of O1s represents the presence of C–OH (∼534.21
eV), and the peaks around 532.55 and 531.07 eV deconvoluted to C–O
and O=C–OH, respectively.31

The L1s peak is found at ∼55.5 eV and confirms the
presence
of Li in the GO framework. The C1s spectra of the Li-doped GO show
peaks at ∼290.83, ∼288.41, ∼286.81, and ∼284.68
eV for Li–C, O=C–O, C–O, and CH/CC, respectively.
Lithium doping is supposed to be interstitial doping to GO;32 still, in some cases, oxygen-containing lithium
species such as LiO2 and/or LiOH are present as an overlayer,
which results in the presence of the sharp L1s peak.

From the figure, it can be found that the B1s peak (∼191.58
eV) shows the presence of boron in the GO structure. This peak is
visible due to the “graphitic” boron while boron atoms
substitute the carbon atoms in the GO frameworks.27 The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of C1s (Figure 6c) shows distinct peaks at
∼291.48, ∼288.78, ∼286.86, and ∼284.72
eV corresponding to the different chemical atmospheres of the C–C
bond in the GO structure.
The intense peak (∼284.72 eV) in the C1s spectrum corresponds
to the C–H/C–C sp2 bonded graphite-like carbon,
which confirms the formation of a conjugated honeycomb structure formed
by most of the carbon atoms in an arranged manner. At higher binding
energies, lower intense peaks are observed, which shows the presence
of some functional groups that bonded with the GO structure even after
partial reduction. Boron doping is believed to be substitutional doping
to GO,33 although in some cases oxygen-containing
boron groups (B=O) are supposed to be present at the sheet
edges of B-doped GO to validate the broad feature of the B1s peak.34

We have tested the humidity-sensing performance
of the undoped
GO, Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO sensors with increasing and decreasing
levels (11–97%) of RH in this work. Parameters such as humidity/sensitivity,
linearity, hysteresis loss, response time, and recovery time are evaluated
to optimize the sensing capability of the sample as a resistive-type
sensor.

The variation in the sensor resistance with different %RH values
(11–97% RH) is shown in Figure 7. From the figure, it can be seen that as the RH level
increases, the obtained resistance of the sensor shifts to the lower
values monotonically. As we already know, the adsorbed water molecules
(confirmed using FTIR and XPS) increase the dielectric constant and
lower the resistance by swelling or 2D capillary effect. Also, more
adsorbed water molecules can strengthen the space–charge polarization
effect and introduce fast diffusion into the inner
portion of the Li-doped GO film.35 Further,
this will help the formation of protons between the hydroxyl-containing
groups. Among the three samples, Li-doped GO exhibits the best linearity.

Figure 7 Linearity
and sensitivity of the prepared samples: (a) GO, (b)
Li-doped GO, and (c) B-doped GO.

Also, Figure 7 demonstrates
the relationship between sensitivity (calculated using eq 3) and %RH. Obviously, the sensitivity
of Li-doped GO is higher than those of all other samples. When the
RH level increases from 11 to 97%, the sensitivity increases from
17.13 to 3038.16%. By contrast, the sensitivities of undoped GO and
B-doped GO increase from 3.28 to 737.03% and 6.95 to 631.10%, respectively.
These values are significantly lower than the value obtained for Li-doped
GO under the same conditions. The detrimental increments in the sensing
capacity are accredited to the presence of water molecules in the
extended interlayer
distance at the time of Li doping and the increase in large charge
storage capability.36 As the RH increases,
the succeeding water molecules attach with the first water layer and
result in a continuous water adsorption by layer-by-layer permeation.
This is possible due to the attaching of the water molecule with the
H-bond through hydroxyl groups. Additionally, the synthesis of our
sensor material and its performance display the required reproducibility
and long-term stability throughout this research.

For a perfect
humidity sensor, the hysteresis value must be very
small or negligible. Therefore, it is one of the most significant
parameters of a humidity sensor and indicates good reliability by
defining the maximum time lag between the adsorption and desorption
processes.
Generally, the hysteresis effect of any sensor material is defined
by the difference between the resistances with respect to increasing
and decreasing %RH. The hysteresis of the prepared samples was measured
by keeping the fabricated thin films between closed air-tight boxes
with the RH ranging from 11 to 97% and vice versa, as shown in Figure 8. The percentage hysteresis (% hysteresis) loss is calculated
using eq 5. The hysteresis
curves
for all samples are shown in Figure 8, where the downward arrow represents the adsorption
phenomenon (11–97% RH) and the upward arrow represents the
desorption phenomenon (97–11% RH). For the Li-doped GO, it
has been found that both the adsorption and desorption lines overlap
each other with a negligible gap, which means that the sample has
a very low hysteresis of 0.83%. However, for undoped GO and B-doped
GO samples, higher hystereses of 1.03 and 2.26%, respectively, are
observed compared with that for the Li-doped GO within the same range.
The results obtained for humidity are listed in Table 1. Thus, the Li-doped GO shows better stability
among all samples.

Figure 8 Hysteresis loss of the prepared samples: (a) GO, (b) Li-doped
GO,
and (c) B-doped GO.

Table 1 Summary

for All Samples

undoped GO	89.4	1.03	23	49	
Li-doped GO	92.0	0.83	4	25	
B-doped GO	71.7	2.26	40	50	
As we know, the main criteria for any humidity sensor
are the significant
effect of response and recovery times. From Figure 9, it can be observed that the response and
recovery times of sensors depend on the different RH levels (ranging
from 11 to 97%). As per the resistance observed from the recorder,
the response time (humidification from 11 to 97% RH) and the recovery
time (dehumidification from 97 to 11% RH) of Li-doped GO were 4 and
25 s, respectively, both better than those of undoped GO (the response
time was 23 s, and the recovery time was 49 s) and B-doped GO (the
response time was 40 s, and the recovery time was 50 s) resistive-type
sensors. The excellent response and recovery times for Li-doped GO
are attributed not only to the ample hydrophilic/oxygen-containing
functional groups (LiOH) present as an overlayer by Li doping (confirmed
using FTIR and XPS results) with GO but also to the large interlayer
distance (at 100) compared with the undoped GO films, which enables
water adsorption and desorption37 during
the reaction. These water molecules act like an electron acceptor,
which in turn increases the response and recovery times. Again, for
B-doped GO, although the interlayer distance (at 002) is increased
compared with GO, due to the substitutional doping of boron, oxygenated
boron species has been found in some cases, which in turn reduces
the hydrophilic functional groups.

samples: (a) GO, (b)
Li-doped GO, and (c) B-doped GO.

of
cost, synthesis, and sensing performance, as shown in Table 2.

2.1 Proposed Mechanism
To confirm the
better sensing properties, a schematic mechanism has been proposed
(Figure 10) to understand the role of sensing materials with
different % RH values. As we know, the GO layers are interlinked by
hydrogen bonding between the different functional groups and water
molecules. At low %RH, water molecules are attached to the available
vacant sites of the GO surface with the help of double hydrogen bonding,
which is known as the first physisorbed water layer (Figure 10). In this case, the double
hydrogen bonding restricts the mobility of water molecules. Because
of the lower number of protons present and the restriction in mobility,
high energy is required to transfer the protons between the adjacent
hydroxyl groups that show a high resistance in GO-based films.36 At high %RH, these water molecules dominate
H-bonds, causing an increase in the space between the GO layers, weakening
of the van der Waals force, and reduction in the H-bond interactions
(intra- and interlayer).40 Because of this,
physisorbed water can be ionized to produce a large number of hydronium
ions as charge carriers that cause a decrease in the electrical resistance.
The proposed mechanism is similar for both Li-doped GO and B-doped
GO.

Figure 10 Proposed sensing mechanism.

It is worth mentioning that doping with lithium creates LiOH
at
the edges (confirmed using FTIR and XPS), which further increases
the humidity of that particular sensor. Also, from the humidity-sensing
results, it has been found that water molecules and oxygenated functional
groups play a vital role for better sensing characteristics.

Graphite
powder (98.5% purity) was purchased from S. K. Carbon Ltd., Faridabad,
India. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) (98% purity), 35%
hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 98% sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) were

3.2 GO Synthesis
This method is a modification
of the earlier-described approaches by Hummers and Offeman41 and Panwar et al.42 Natural flakes of graphite (1 g) were dispersed into a 100 mL solution
of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), and ortho-phosphoric acid (H3PO4) with a volume ratio of 7:2:1, respectively. This
solution was stirred for 2–3 h to achieve a graphite-intercalated
compound (GIC). The reaction mechanism involves HNO3- and
H3PO4-assisted cointercalation; primarily, HNO3 molecules intercalate into the graphite layers, and in the
second step, HNO3 molecules are replaced with larger H3PO4 molecules and hence increase the overall distances
of individual graphite layers.43 H2SO4 also takes part in the intercalation, but it
helps in the formation of dimanganese heptoxide by reacting with KMnO4 according to the following reaction17,44 1   2  Because this dimanganese
heptoxide (Mn2O7) is very unstable and explosive
in nature, the
reaction temperature was maintained within 55 °C during the addition
of 6 g of KMnO4. After the addition of KMnO4, the solution was transferred into an oil bath to maintain the same
temperature during 12 h of continuous stirring to oxidize
the GIC. Again, 0.8 wt % NaOH in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water was
added dropwise to the suspension under constant stirring.

The
resultant solution was heated up to 80 °C in the oil bath under
continuous stirring for 3–4 h. Then, the heated solution was
diluted by adding an additional 120 mL of water under continuous stirring.
After 15 min of the addition of water, H2O2 (8
mL) was added to the solution to finish the reaction. The solution
became yellow, confirming the end of the reaction. For purification,
the mixture was washed several times by rinsing and centrifugation
with 10% HCl followed by DI water. After filtration followed by drying
(under vacuum) at room temperature, the GO powder was obtained and
confirmed by different characterizations.

3.3 Preparation
of Li-Doped and B-Doped GO
The obtained undoped GO (1 g)
powder was added with lithium hydroxide
(5 wt%) in 150 mL of DI water, followed by sonication for 30 min;
then, the obtained solution was heated at a constant temperature of
100 °C for 36 h. Then, the solution was filtered and washed with
DI water. In the same way, we prepared B-doped GO films using GO powder
combined with boric acid (H3BO3). The GO/H3BO3 mixture was prepared using the reflux method
to systematically control the efficiency of boron doping in the undoped
GO. The syntheses of undoped GO, Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO are shown
in Figure S1. Then, both the Li-doped GO
and B-doped GO powder were added to water through sonication (10:1
ratio) and put onto a cleaned glass substrate for preparing the thin
film by the drop-casting process.

3.4 Characterization
A Thermo-Nicolet
FTIR spectrometer was used for a detailed evaluation of the structural
properties of the prepared composite using KBr pellets. The surface
morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared films were investigated
using a FEI Quanta 200 F field emission scanning electron microscope
at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The crystallinity analysis was
carried out using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer
with high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) in the range
of 15°–90° (2θ). To analyze the thermal degradation
of the composites, TGA was performed using an Exstar TG/DTA 6300 thermogravimetric
analyzer in the temperature range 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1 under an air flow rate of 200
mL min–1. XPS analysies of undoped GO, Li-doped
GO, and B-doped GO powder samples were carried out on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe-II.
Raman spectra of the samples were measured using an Invia Renishaw
Raman spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm using
an argon ion laser.

3.5 Sensor Fabrication and
Experimental Setup
Glass slides (7.5 × 2.5 cm2) with a thickness of
1.2 mm were cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 strips followed
by a well-cleaning process using Piranha solution (3:1 mixture of
H2SO4 with H2O2) to remove
any organic residues from the surface of the substrate. Two copper
plates as electrodes (with dimensions of 20 × 4.65 × 0.16
mm3) were intricately equipped at the two ends of each
strip with a conductive silver paste, leaving a gap of 7.5 ×
7.5 mm2 for the humidity-sensing test. For electrical connectivity
between the sensor and the controlled dc power supply, a 10 cm-long
copper wire (having 0.6 mm diameter) was soldered at each end of the
electrodes. The open areas of the electrodes were wrapped by a Teflon
tape to avoid any chemical reaction arising from humidity or any other
surrounding substances. In thin film sensor fabrication, thin films
of undoped GO, Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO (50 mL, 1 mg/mL, dissolved
in water) samples were prepared by dispersion of the sample on an
empty area of a glass substrate by the drop-casting process. Then,
the glass substrate was oven-dried at a temperature under 55 °C
for 2 h.

A homemade setup (Figure S2) was constructed to carry out the humidity-sensing studies. In this
setup, six boxes (approximate volume of ∼737 cm3) were taken for different humidity
conditions ranging from 11 to 97%. For creating the different RH conditions,
different saturated salt solutions were taken, such as LiCl, MgCl2·6H2O, MgNO3·4H2O, NaNO3, NaCl, KCl, and K2SO4,
which yielded 11, 33, 51, 62, 75, 84, and 97% RH, respectively, in
air-tight closed plastic boxes made of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)
at room temperature (30 °C). These solutions were kept overnight
in the respective boxes at a controlled atmosphere (room temperature
≈ 25 °C) to confirm that the trapped air inside of the
boxes reached an equilibrium state (optimum humidity condition). Next
day, the obtained RH levels in different boxes were tested using a
standard hygrometer to ensure the required %RH was obtained.

The humidity measurement was carried out by inserting the thin
film on a glass substrate in the respective RH boxes until the input
current of the sensing material reached a stable value. Resistance
of the sample according to the fixed RH was measured using a picoammeter
with a constant −10 to 10 V dc voltage supply, using Ohm’s
law. The same process was followed for all boxes more than nine times
day and night. The testing was done in the glove box for maintaining
a constant environment. The average value of the obtained resistance
was used for this study. The same procedure was followed for all RH
percentages.

3.6 Calibration and Sensing
Measurements of the
Devices
Before the experiment, all saturated salt solutions
were kept inside of the boxes with necessary amount of water to make
it fully saturated. Then, a dry-bulb thermometer was used to measure
the dry-bulb temperature (Tdb) from the atmosphere, and a wet-bulb thermometer was used to measure
the wet-bulb temperature (Twb) for the
particular salt solution. The difference between the temperatures
(Tdb – Twb) was used to calculate the %RH by using the psychrometric chart/calculator,
as shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Calibration Table Used for Measuring
the %RH
name of saturated salts	Tdb – Twb (°C)	calculated %RH	measured %RH	
lithium chloride (LiCl·H2O)	31.5 – 14.4 = 17.1	11.0	11	
magnesium chloride (MgCl2·2H2O)	30.4 – 19.2 = 11.2	33.3	33	
magnesium nitrate (MgNO3·4H2O)	30.5 – 22.6 = 7.9	50.5	51	
sodium nitrate (NaNO3)	31.0 – 25.0 = 6.0	62.0	62	
sodium
chloride (NaCl)	32.0 – 28.0 = 4.0	74.5	75	
potassium chloride (KCl)	32.0 – 29.6 = 2.4	83.5	84	
potassium sulfate (K2SO4)	31.0 – 30.6 = 0.4	96.5	97	
Then, the sensitivity of
the prepared sample was measured using
the percentage relative change in dc electrical resistance (ΔR/R%), defined as follows 3  where Re and Rx denote the sensor resistance in the empty
box and in the respective RH box (RHx) (from 11 to 97%).
In addition, during this experiment, the RH and room temperature were
approximately ∼31% and ∼27 °C, respectively.

The percentage linearity and hysteresis of the sensor were calculated
using the following equation 4   5  where ymax and ymin are the maximum
and minimum values of the
obtained resistance at maximum and minimum %RH; ys is the resistance mean value at the mean of the %RH.
In the case of hysteresis, ymn and ymp are the maximum and minimum values of y at the mean of the %RH.

4 Conclusions
A novel, cheap, and reliable resistive-type humidity sensor based
on undoped GO, Li-doped GO, and B-doped GO has been presented in this
work. Other researchers have found better sensitivity, response time,
and recovery time for GO as a capacitive-type sensor but not for resistive-type.
Again, as per the comparative study presented in this work, it has
been found that these sensors are quite expensive, have long response
and recovery times, and need a complex synthesis process. From this
study, it has been observed that the large number of hydrophilic/oxygen-containing
groups, including carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups as well as vacancies
present in Li-doped GO films, bestow the Li-doped GO as an excellent
humidity-sensing material. As we know, the presence of more water
molecules increases the ion conductivity of the materials. Electrical
property (resistance) testing with different levels of RH shows that
the sensor based on Li-doped GO exhibits excellent sensitivity (3038.26%)
compared with the other samples over the entire RH range (11–97%).
Moreover, the sensor shows an exceptional performance with respect
to quick response and recovery times, low hysteresis, and excellent
stability. From this study, we find that doping dominates the whole
research compared with other virgin samples for the humidity sensor.
Herewith, we also propose a mechanism that can help readers understand
the excellent potential performance of the Li-doped GO sensor.
