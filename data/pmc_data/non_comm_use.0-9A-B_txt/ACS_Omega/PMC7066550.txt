The deleterious effects of nerve agents over the enzymes acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) turned these compounds into
the most dangerous chemical weapons known. Among the antidotes in
use today against these agents, oximes in combination with other drugs
are the only treatment with any action. HI-6 and 2-PAM are cationic
oximes proved to be effective for the reactivation of AChE inhibited
by the nerve agents VX and sarin (GB). However, when it comes to reactivation
of AChE inside the central or peripheral nervous systems, charged
molecules present low diffusion due to low penetration through the
blood–brain barrier. Uncharged oximes appear as an interesting
alternative to solve this problem, but the development and enhancement
of more efficient uncharged oximes capable of reactivating human AChE
is still necessary. Given the limitations for in vivo and in vitro
experimental studies with nerve agents, modeling is an important tool
that can contribute to a better understanding of factors that may
affect the efficiency of uncharged oximes. In order to investigate
the interaction and behavior of cationic and uncharged oximes, we
performed here molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations,
and binding energies calculations of the known cationic oximes HI-6
and 2-PAM plus four uncharged oximes found in the literature, complexed
with human AChE (HssACHE) conjugated with the nerve
agents VX and GB. The uncharged oximes showed different behaviors,
especially RS194B, which presented stability inside AChE-VX, but presented
free binding energy lower than cationic oximes, suggesting that structural
alterations could favor its interactions with these complexes. In
contrast, HI-6 and 2-PAM showed higher affinities with more negative
binding energy values and larger contribution of the amino acid Asp74,
demonstrating the importance of the quaternary nitrogen to the affinity
and interaction of oximes with AChE-GB and AChE-VX conjugates.

Introduction
Despite being toxic pesticides and/or insecticides, the major risk
represented by the organophosphorus (OP) compounds to human health
comes from their use as chemical warfare agents.1−5 OP compounds are defined as nerve agents because
their main target is the human central nervous system (CNS), where
they are capable of inhibiting the hydrolysis, usually performed by
the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE),2,4−6 of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in post-synaptic membranes
and neuromuscular junctions. The inhibition mechanism of the OP is
analogous to the reaction of AChE with ACh7,8 and
is well described in the literature,6,9−17 except for the step of the leaving group of the OP, resulting in
the phosphorylation of AChE which triggers the cholinergic syndrome,
defined as an overstimulation of structures innervated by cholinergic
fibers.17−21

The literature reports that the reversal of the inhibition process
is possible by reactivating AChE using oximes, which are nucleophiles
capable of displacing the OP by dephosphorylating the residue Ser203
(in the human case), that is part of the catalytic triad with His447
and Glu334 of the active site.9,11,22−28 However, the oxime should be administered as soon as possible to
prevent the process called “aging” of AChE, which is
characterized by the elimination of an alkyl moiety (R1) from the
OP.11,22−26,28 Among the oximes found
in the literature, 1-[[2-[(E)-hydroxyiminomethyl]pyridin-1-ium-1-yl]methoxymethyl]pyridin-1-ium-4-carboxamide
(Asoxime chloride, or most commonly HI-6) (Figure 1) and (NE)-N-[(1-methylpyridin-1-ium-2-yl)methylidene]hydroxylamine (pralidoxime,
or most commonly 2-PAM) (Figure 1) stand out for their efficiency in the AChE reactivation
process.11,22−26,29−35 Even with studies suggesting the importance of the quaternary nitrogen
in AChE reactivation, some studies in the literature argue that the
cationic oximes, which present great reactivating potential in in
vitro and in vivo tests, show a significant reduction in their efficiency.36−39 This is attributed to the fact that such oximes do not present good
diffusion through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and diffuse
through the blood and peripheral tissues.36−40 Therefore, in this work, we decided to analyze, through
molecular modeling, the behavior and interactions of the neutral oximes
RS41A, RS194B, RS48B, and RS182A (Figure 1) found in the literature,36−39 which presented good diffusion
through the BBB in comparison to the commercial oximes HI-6 and 2-PAM,
in order to determine some factors, besides the quaternary nitrogen,
that may influence the interaction of the complexes of AChE with sarin
(GB) and VX, which are two of the most lethal chemical warfare agents.2

Methodology
The oximes had their aqueous ionization constants (pKa) evaluated at biological pH (pH = 7.4) in the chemicalize
server (www.chemicalize.com) by the prediction of a dissociation constant method, using micro
constants.41 Oximes HI-6, RS41A, and RS194B
were predicted to present ionization at this pH (see Figure S1 of Supporting Information) but not the other oximes.

The three-dimensional structures of each oxime, guided by previous
results, had the partial atomic charge calculation performed in Spartan
08 Suite42 using the semiempirical method
RM1.43−47

The three-dimensional model structures of AChE inhibited by OPs
(AChE-OP) complexed with HI-6 were constructed through mutations on
the crystallographic structure of Mus musculus AChE complexed with HI-6 and inhibited by GB (AChE-GB) and VX (AChE-VX),
available in the RCSB-Protein Data Bank48 under the codes 2WHP(49) and 2Y2U, respectively, using the software SPDBViewer.50,51 The target and the template presented more than 85% of homological
identity. The models obtained were further used to perform docking
studies using the software Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) with MolDock52 as the docking algorithm. Water molecules from
the crystal were conserved in the calculations in order to investigate
eventual interactions with the solvent. To calculate the interaction
energy, the MolD score uses the spatial configuration of the atoms
contained in the study systems. In our specific case, this spatial
configuration is presented by the crystallographic structure. The
re-docking of HI-6 in the active site of crystallographic AChE was
performed in order to validate the docking protocol. A sphere with
11 Å of radius, centered in the binding pocket, was the selected
docking region. Because of the stochastic nature of the docking algorithm,
about 20 runs were performed for each compound, resulting in 30 poses
(conformation and orientation of the oxime) generated for each run.
The criteria adopted to select the best poses were the most negative
value (suggesting greater stability and affinity) of the scoring function,
hydrogen bonds, and the distance between the O atom of the oxime and
the P atom of the OP. The poses selected were used as initial configurations
for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

For the MD simulations, the complexes AChE-OP were constructed
using the GROMACS 4.6.7 Suite53−56 and confined inside of octahedral boxes with around
1000 nm3 under periodic boundary conditions.57 The boxes were filled with around 24,000 water
molecules using the model TIP3P58−60 to reproduce the effect of the
solvent. The force field used was OPLS-AA,61 which presents excellent results for protein systems but has no
parameters for small organic molecules, making a parameterization
step for the oximes necessary. The topology and coordinate files were
created, from the docking poses, with the AcPype62 software, and the atomic charges restrained electrostatic
potential method63−66 calculated by semi-empirical AM1-BCC,67 parameterized to reproduce the method Hartree–Fock and basis
set 6-31G*, which reproduces the experimental data of the oxime structure
very well.68 The energy minimization of
the systems was achieved in four steps: first, using steepest descent
algorithm, with position restrained (PR) and convergence criterion
of 100.00 kJ mol–1 nm–1; second,
using steepest descent again with the same convergence criterion but
without PR; third, using conjugate gradients, with a convergence criterion
of 20.00 kJ mol–1 nm–1; and the
last step, using the low-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno69 algorithm approach, with a convergence criterion
of 10.00 kJ mol–1 nm–1. In order
to balance temperature and pressure, the minimized complexes were
submitted to thermalization steps. The equilibration of the temperature
was achieved using the canonical ensemble (NVT),70 keeping the number of particles, volume, and
temperature constant, with a time of 100 ps. The pressure equilibration
was achieved continuing the simulation from the NVT equilibration phase and using isothermal–isobaric ensemble
(NPT),70 keeping the number
of particles, pressure, and temperature constant. The equilibration
step was followed by a production step of 40 ns at 310 K and 1 bar,
using 2 fs of the integration time with the lists of pairs being updated
at every 5 steps. The cut-off for Lennard Jones and Coulomb interactions
was between 0 and 1.2 nm. The leap-frog algorithm was used in the
production step with the Nosé–Hoover thermostat71 (τ = 0.5 ps) at 310 K and the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat72 (τ = 2.0 ps) at 1 bar.
All Arg and Lys residues were assigned with positive charges, and
all Glu and Asp residues were assigned with negative charges. The
VMD73 software was used to visualize the
simulation trajectories.

The molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) surface area
method has been widely used for free energy calculations in biological
systems and has shown good affinity for proteins and ligands.42,45−47,74−79 The PB equation is used to calculate the contributions to the interaction
energy between a ligand and a protein.80,81 To calculate
the free binding energies between the studied oximes and the AChE-OP
complexes, we used the g_mmpbsa80,82 software, which uses
the trajectories resulting from MD simulations to determine the interactions
between two pre-established groups, in our case, AChE-OP and oxime,
previously separated into an index file. In this method, the free
binding energy is defined as follows 1  

Fitting the eq 1 to
the cases under study, we have45 2  where GComplex represents the free energy of the complex AChE/GA/oxime, GAChE+OP represents the free energy of the protein,
and GOxime represents the free energy
of the oxime.80

Each term in the eq 2 above must be calculated in the following way 3  where “⟨ ⟩” represents
mean values and EMM is the mechanics potential energy in vacuum. Temperature
and entropy are depicted by the terms T and S, respectively, which together represent the entropic contribution
to the free energy in a vacuum.80 The energy
necessary to transfer a solute from the vacuum to the solvent (GSolvation) is called the free energy of solvation
and is obtained from the sum of two terms 4  Gpolar arises
from the electrostatic interaction between the solute and solvent,
and it is obtained by solving the PB equation using the implicit (continuum)
approximation.80

To calculate the binding energy components, the systems were subjected
to three steps: the calculation of the potential energy in vacuum,
the calculation of polar solvation energy, and the calculation of
nonpolar solvation energy. Among the several models available for
the nonpolar component, we used the SASA model83 with a surface tension of 0.0226778 (kJ/mol2) and a probe radius of 1.4 Å. For the calculations, dielectric
constants of 6, 80, and 1 were used for the protein, water, and void,
respectively. Subsequently, two python scripts (available at https://rashmikumari.github.io/g_mmpbsa/) were used. The scripts compile the energy component calculation
files into two output files containing ΔGBindind and the contribution of each amino acid.

Analysis Methods
From the obtained trajectory, analyses were performed using tools
offered by the GROMACS package53−56 and plotted with the Origin software.84 The distance between the centers of mass (COM)
of the OP and the oxime as a function of time was obtained by the
g_dist tool, which determines the distance between the COM of two
system components from the x, y,
and z coordinates. The g_rms tool provided root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) by comparing each structure from the trajectory to
a reference structure; in this case, the initial system structure.
The hydrogen bonds (H-bond) were determined based on cutoffs for the
angle and distance of the H-bond donor and the H-bond acceptor through
the g_hbond tool, where OH and NH groups are considered the donors,
while O and N are the acceptors.54,56

In order to analyze and compare the interaction sites of AChE-VX
and AChE-GB, the contribution of each amino acid to the binding energies
and the volume of the interaction site were calculated. The contributions
were determined by the g_mmpbsa tool, which decomposes the total binding
energy into the contribution made by each residue, enabling a comparison
of the relative contribution of residues to the overall binding energy.80 To determine the volume of the interaction site,
the grid-based cavity prediction algorithm was used, which determines
a region as a possible cavity and its volume, creating a discrete
grid with a resolution of 0.5 Å, covering the protein and, at
each grid point a sphere of radius 1.4 Å is placed.52 The grid points will be referred to as part
of the inaccessible volume where clashes occur with the protein atom
spheres and all other points are referred to as accessible.52 Each accessible grid point is checked to see
if it is part of a cavity. Starting from a given grid point, the algorithm
chooses a random direction, and this direction (and the opposite direction)
is followed until the grid boundaries are hit, checking if an inaccessible
grid point is hit on the way, and this is repeated a number of times.
If the percentage of lines hitting an inaccessible volume is larger
than a given threshold, the point is marked as being part of a cavity.52 The threshold is adjusted according to the location
of the cavities found, where a value of 0% is only possible away from
the protein, as opposed to a value of 100%, corresponding to a binding
site deeply buried in the protein.52 In
order to evaluate the influence of the OP on the conformation of inhibited
AChE, g_rmsf was used to compute the root-mean-square fluctuation
(RMSF) of backbone amino acid positions, in the trajectory of the
AChE-OP simulation, using the initial configuration as refs (54) and (56). The SuperPose85 server was used to perform the AChE-VX and AChE-GB
superposition and calculate the RMSD between structures. To generate
the image, we used UCSF Chimera86 (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera) with the PyChimera87 script.

Results and Discussion
An analysis of the protonation state of oximes as a function of
pH was performed by chemicalize, through the prediction of the dissociation
constant method, using micro constants. The protonation state chosen
was the one with the highest prevalence in the physiological pH of
human blood and compared to the experimental data provided.37 HI-6 shows a deprotonation of oxime OH, with
a prevalence of 93%, while RS41A and RS194B shows the cyclic N atom
protonated, with prevalence of 96 and 98%, respectively (see Figure S1). The calculations were performed with
the most abundant species of each oxime.

The main selection criteria of the selected docking poses were
the shortest distance between the O atom of the oxime and P atom of
the OP (which would favor the reactivation reaction) and higher affinity
(more negative scoring function). Table 1 presents the values calculated by the MVD47 MolDock scoring function for interactions of
oximes with the AChE-OP complexes. In the docking results, we highlight
the behavior of the larger molecular structures (HI-6, RS48B, and
RS182A), which presented MolDock scoring function more negative than
the smaller ones (2-PAM, RS41A, and RS194B) for all systems, being
directly related to the interaction energies and H-bonds formed with
amino acids. It is important to highlight that this difference may
be directly related to the fact that the crystallographic structure
of the inhibited enzyme is complexed with HI-6, implying in a larger
interaction site, favoring the interactions of larger oximes. The
interaction modes of the best poses of each oxime inside each system
are shown in Figures S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information.

The efficacy of oximes depends on their reactivity and affinity
toward the AChE-OP complex, where the reactivity derived from the
nucleophilic activity of the oxime moiety and the affinity is derived
from physicochemical features (steric compatibility, electrostatic
effects, and hydrophobic interactions).24,88 The graphs
of RMSD vs time for the AChE-OP/oxime complexes (Figure 2) were plotted in order to
analyze the stability and affinity of the systems.

Figure 2 RMSD vs time for the AChE-VX (black)/oxime (dark cyan) and AChE-GB
(green)/oxime (orange) complexed with (a) HI-6, (b) 2-PAM, (c) RS41A,
(d) RS194B (e) RS48B, and (f) RS182A. The RMSD of AChE inhibited is
from the amino acid backbone variations.

The results for 2-PAM (Figure 2b) stand out because it presents low position variation
in both systems. This fact could be related to the affinity and the
interactions performed with the enzymes, as observed in the binding
energy values (Table 2).

HI-6, unlike 2-PAM, presented a larger position variation with
AChE-GB (Figure 2a)
but was restricted to the range of 0.17 and 0.22 nm, throughout the
simulation, which can be considered stable, given its degree of freedom
and frame size. The position changes of HI-6 inside AChE-VX (Figure 2a) are stabilized
after 20 ns (20,000 ps) of simulation. This behavior can be explained
by the larger volume of the interaction site of HI-6 inside the complex
AChE-VX, related to AChE-GB. This causes the solvent molecules present
in the site to take longer to settle, an effect evidenced by the H-bonds
formed between HI-6 and the solvent (Figure 3a) during the simulation, which increases
from one to three after 20 ns. Plots of RMSD for the apo enzymes shown
in Figure S4 show that the systems stabilize
before the 20 ns of MD simulation.

Figure 3 H-bonds formed between oximes HI-6 (a) and RS48B (b) and solvent
inside the complex AChE-VX, during the MD simulations.

In vivo experiments, the difference in the efficiency of HI-6 compared
to 2-PAM against VX and GB poisoning is not evident or statistically
significant, as previously described in the literature.23,31,89 However, in in vitro studies,
HI-6 showed high affinity and higher velocity of reactivation than
2-PAM at low concentrations for both nerve agents. Meanwhile, 2-PAM
was able to significantly reactivate AChE inhibited by both OPs, but
concentrations that did not correspond to in vivo recommended doses
were required.34,88,90,91 These data are evidenced in our studies
by the results of binding energies (Table 2) of these oximes, where higher affinity
of HI-6 for the AChE-OP complexes is evident, which can highlight
here the influence of the two quaternary N atoms in electrostatic
effects, which granted twice more affinity compared to 2-PAM. The
values of Kox found in the literature38 for 2-PAM, RS41A, and RS194B inside AChE-GB
and AChE-VX (see Table 2), corroborate our theoretical results once they are much lower for
2-PAM. As Kox refers to the dissociation
of the oxime from the interaction site, the lower its value the higher
the affinity of the oxime for the site, similar to the interaction
energies.

Sit et al. and later Radić et al.,37,38 in their studies demonstrated that RS41A and RS194B penetrate CNS
quickly and a favorable antidotal action was achieved. However, in
our studies, the oximes RS41A and RS194B (except for the system AChE-VX/RS194B,
which will be discussed later) showed a larger position variation
throughout the MD simulation. Behavior reflected by their respective
binding energies with the AChE-OP complexes, showing much lower affinity,
compared to the cationic oximes. Importantly, the presence of a protonated
cyclic amine in both oximes, given the result of the study of ionization
constants, was not sufficient to provide a good affinity for the complex
AChE-OP because when evaluating the variation of the distances between
the COM of oxime and OP (Figure 4), we observed that RS41A (Figure 4e,f) and RS194B (Figure S3 of Supporting Information) were moving away from
the OP and consequently from the catalytic site. This considerably
impairs the reactivation process, given the importance of the oxime’s
affinity for the interaction site and effectiveness of the kinetic
process.24,49,88,92−94

during MD and determined by interactions between the oximes and the
complexes AChE-OP. (a) VX/HI-6, (b) GB/HI-6, (c) VX/2-PAM, (d) GB/2-PAM,
(e) VX/RS41A, and (f) GB/RS41A. Other histograms can be checked in
Figures S4 of the Supporting Information

Specifically, RS194B inside the AChE-VX interaction site presented
a small range of position variation as a function of time, different
from the results presented inside AChE-GB. However, as previously
mentioned, the graphs of distances between COM of oxime and OP show
that RS194B moves slightly away from the catalytic site.

RS41A and RS194B presented low affinity in both systems, as can
be seen through the values of binding energy, especially when compared
to the cationic oximes, in agreement with the results reported by
Sit et al. and Radić et al.37,38 Despite having
binding energy values below the cationic oximes, RS194B has better
stability and affinity than RS41A inside AChE-VX, even though both
have similar structures with the only difference in the cyclic moiety.
The stability of RS194B inside AChE-VX can be justified by the hydrophobic
interactions between the cyclic moiety and amino acids of the interaction
site, favored by its smaller volume (Table 2). Besides, we can add the fact that it does
not form stable H-bonds with any of the AChE-OP complexes and, instead,
formed more H-bonds with solvent molecules (3 H-bond with the solvent
inside AChE-VX and 5 H-bond with the solvent inside AChE-GB).

Oxime RS48B presented a great variation of position up to 20 ns
of simulation in both systems, as previously reported. Initially,
there is a displacement toward the catalytic site (evidenced by the
distance histogram of the COM, of Figure S5), but as can be observed in Figure 3b, like with HI-6, after 20 ns, the H-bonds formed
with solvent molecules contributed to stabilize the molecule at the
interaction site. RS182A, like RS48B, initially moves away from the
catalytic site (see distance histogram of COM, at Figure S5) and then remains stable in both systems. This can
be justified by the large number of H-bond formed (up to six in the
AChE-VX/RS182A complex and up to eight in the AChE-GB/RS182A complex).
However, both RS48B and RS182A, despite having the larger structures,
higher number of substituents, and more H-bond formed, presented affinities
for the AChE-OP complex far below the cationic oximes and close to
the protonated ones, as can be seen by the binding energies values
shown in Table 2. The
position changes of one heterocycle, apparently did not change the
affinity of these oximes for AChE-VX, unlike AChE-GB, where there
is a higher affinity of RS182A, most likely due to interactions that
favored greater stability.

Among the amino acids that contributed to the higher affinity of
the cationic oximes, we can highlight Glu334 and Asp74. Glu334, being
part of the catalytic triad of AChE, playing a fundamental role in
the hydrolysis of ACh, as previously described.95,96 Asp74 is part of the so-called peripheral anionic site (PAS) located
around the entrance to the active site gorge, which in addition to
Asp74, consists of residues Tyr72, Tyr124, Trp286, and Tyr341.96,97 The PAS is a site where a ligand can be tethered to a drug candidate
not only for increasing the overall binding affinity but also by enhancing
the reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE.95,98 The effect
of the PAS contribution on the affinity between oximes and the AChE-OP
complex can be evidenced by the difference in the binding energies
of the cationic oximes related to other oximes. Because the area of
PAS is surrounded by acidic residues, there is a concentration of
negative charges in this region, capable of binding cationic and aromatic
oximes.95−97 This is probably the reason why HI-6 presents a higher
binding energy than 2-PAM, once one of these two positively charged
nitrogen docks closer to the PAS site region.

The difference in contribution from Asp74 to HI-6 inside the AChE-OP
complexes can be explained by the conformational difference of the
interaction sites (Figure 5) due to the smaller volume observed for the complex AChE-VX
compared to AChE-GB. With a smaller volume at the interaction site,
the PAS region can interact better with HI-6 inside the AChE-VX site
(see Figure 5a and Table 2).

Figure 5 Influence of the differences between the interaction sites of AChE-VX
(a) and AChE-GB (b) on the amino acid contributions to the binding
energies of HI-6. The different colors in the tertiary structure of
the AChE-OP complexes represent (in kJ mol–1) the
contributions of each amino acid and the regions to the binding energy
between oxime and the complex AChE-OP.

According to the literature, the AChE inhibition reaction by VX
induces a slight structural change in the side chain of His447, while
the AChE-GB structure shows an apo-like conformation for His447,94 and phosphonylation causes a reduction in space
in the cavity relative to apo-like AChE.88 However, when we analyze the fluctuation (Figure 6) of the amino acids of the AChE-OP complexes
without the oxime, we find that the AChE-GB complex presents greater
position variation from the initial system configuration when compared
to AChE-VX. Amino acids from both systems started from the same initial
configuration, showing that GB can influence the structure of the
entire protein because of its interaction with the amino acids of
the active site. This interaction gives the interaction site greater
volume and directly affects the interactions between amino acids and
oximes. It can be seen from the RMSF (Figure 6) that AChE-VX presents largest fluctuations
in only three regions, between amino acids 72–98, 250–280,
and 330–360, respectively. These fluctuations are very important
because these regions contains all amino acids of the PAS, demonstrating
the importance of this site for the interaction with the oximes and
AChE reactivation.

Figure 6 RMSF of the amino acids of AChE-VX (orange) and AChE-GB (green)
fitting the initial structure of each system as a reference.

The protein superposition demonstrated that there is a conformational
difference between the systems, as can be observed in Figure 7, where the backbones have
an RMSD of 3.79 nm, showing that there are conformational differences
in the two systems and, as commented before, this has great influence
on the interaction with the oximes. It is important to mention that
there are no reports yet of the experimental data proving the volume
difference between the AChE-VX and AChE-GB interaction sites, only
data suggesting that there is a difference between them.94

the differences between their most stable conformations.

Conclusions
Our results were capable of showing that even being able to diffuse
through the CNS, the uncharged oximes studied may not present good
affinity for VX and GB-inhibited AChE when compared to the cationic
commercial oximes HI-6 and 2-PAM. For the larger oximes, the H-bond
formed with the solvent were crucial for their stability in the interaction
site, as seen for HI-6, RS48B, and RS182A. The interaction of amino
acids of PAS with the oximes demonstrated the great importance of
the quaternary nitrogen to improve the affinity between the oxime
and the complex AChE-OP but, also, that this interaction is not as
effective for RS41A and RS194B. The simulations showed that the difference
in the spatial configuration in the oxime interaction region inside
AChE-VX and AChE-GB may represent a problem in the development of
efficient oximes against intoxication with VX and GB because this
may cause considerable difference in affinity with the oximes. In
summary, these studies expand and extend the database on uncharged
oximes and should be helpful in assessing their potential as an alternative
antidote for nerve agent poisoning.
