In this work, we demonstrate the
existence of linear relationships
between gas-phase equilibrium bond lengths of the guanidine skeleton
of 2-(arylamino)imidazolines and their aqueous pKa value. For a training set of 22 compounds, in the most
stable conformation of their lowest energy tautomeric form, three
bonds were found to exhibit r2 and q2 values >0.95 and root-mean-squared-error
of
estimation values ≤0.25 when regressed individually against
pKa. The equations describing these one-bond-length
linear relationships, in addition to a multiple linear regression
model using all three bond lengths, were then used to predict the
experimental pKa values of an external
test set of further 27 derivatives. The optimal protocol we derive
here shows an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.20 and standard
deviation of errors of 0.18 for the test set. Predictions for a second
test set of diphenyl-based bis(2-iminoimidazolidines) yielded an MAE
of 0.27 and a standard deviation of 0.10. The predictive power of
the optimal model is further demonstrated by its ability to correct
erroneously reported experimental values. Finally, a previously established
guanidine model is recalibrated at a new level of theory, and predictions
are made for novel phenylguanidine derivatives, showing an MAE of
just 0.29. The protocols established and tested here pass both of
Roy’s modern and stringent MAE-based criteria for a “good”
quantitative structure–activity relationship/quantitative structure–property
relationship model predictivity. Notably, the ab initio bond length
high correlation subset protocol developed in this work demonstrates
lower MAE values than the Marvin program by ChemAxon for all test
sets.

1 Introduction
Having
a measure for the propensity of a molecule to lose or gain
a proton, under given conditions, (e.g., pH, solvent, and temperature)
has applications in numerous fields. For synthetic chemists, knowledge
of pKa values provides means to manipulate
mechanistic routes. In a physiological context, biochemical reactions
may be rationalized with insight into the protonation state of the
reacting species. The absorption, diffusion, metabolism, excretion,
and toxicity profiles of a drug candidate strongly depends on its
ionization state under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the
Trapp model, used in the agrochemical industry to predict the ease
with which a compound can travel through the phloem of a plant to
its target site, uses pKa in addition
to the log P value of a lead compound.1

The measurement of pKa values of small,
weakly acidic molecules (pKa range 2–15)
may be achieved accurately via a variety of methods, including ultraviolet–visible
spectrometry, potentiometry, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
to name a few. An accurate method for the determination of pKa without the need for synthesis offers great
advantage in the context of early-stage drug and agrochemical discovery,
when thousands of potential compounds must be assessed for target
specificity and selectivity. The pursuit of a fast, accurate, and
all-encompassing pKa prediction method
is still a key challenge in chemistry, and in particular, the prediction
accuracy of bases is of much interest.2−4

Empirical pKa predictors, such as ACD/pKa DB5 of ACD/Labs
and Epik,6 utilize extensive databases
of experimental values to formulate a set of rules to predict ionization
feasibility, in line with known substituent effects. To do so, they
often invoke Hammett–Taft equations, with additional molecule-specific
details such as mesomer standardization and charge cancellation. Marvin7 is the pKa prediction
package from ChemAxon, which uses quantitative structure property
relationships (QSPRs) based on various chemical descriptors, including
partial charge and polarizability. First principles-based approaches
have also been widely explored but are yet to be widely implemented
in popular chemical software packages, with the exception of Jaguar
pKa2,8 by Schrödinger.
These protocols calculate the change in Gibbs energy for dissociation,
accessing pKa values via the relation
of this calculated quantity to the temperature, gas constant, and
common logarithm of the dissociation constant. This approach to pKa prediction prescribes implementation of a
thermodynamic cycle of some sort, whereby both gas-phase and solution-phase
energies are calculated for deprotonated and protonated species. Composite
methods such as G3SX,9 CBS-QB3, and CBS-APNO10 have been shown to work favorably in the calculation
of relevant thermodynamic quantities, but the high computational cost
accrued by such high levels of theory remains a barrier to their utility.
Recently, Ho11 suggested that the use of
thermodynamic cycles can be avoided completely via high-level electronic
structure calculations [MP2/GTMP2Large and G3(MP2)-RAD(+)], computed
directly in the solution phase with the SMD solvation model.12 Other recent work4 details the use of an isodesmic reaction scheme, whereby relevant
energetic quantities are computed using semiempirical methods. The
authors implement AM1/SMD and PM3/SMD for a structurally diverse set
of amines, yielding root-mean-squared-error values of 1.0 and 1.1
pKa units, respectively. An error of 5.69
kJ mol–1 in the Gibbs free energy will alter the
predicted pKa value by one unit. Hence,
accuracy in the determination of the intermediate free energy values
for first principles calculations is imperative.

In the pursuit
of prediction accuracy in the first principles-based
methods, the solvation scheme must also be considered, in addition
to the choice of the thermodynamic cycle variant and the level of
theory. Implicit–explicit models, whereby at least one water
molecule is included to represent hydrogen bonding interactions, have
been shown to offer significant improvement in the solvation energies
over the use of an implicit model alone.13−15 However, modeling
the water molecules quantum mechanically further add to computational
expense. The Jaguar pKa program2,8 by Schrödinger works by applying empirical corrections to
“raw” pKa values obtained
using density functional theory (DFT) and a direct thermodynamic cycle.
Prediction accuracy and a low dependence on the initial input conformation
are achieved by thorough consideration of conformational effects on
pKa, and excellent mean absolute error
(MAE) values are obtained (0.2 pKa units
for a set of cyclic amidines). Because of the treatment of compounds
as three-dimensional (3D) structures, their protocol is proven capable
of discerning different pKa values for
two stereoisomers as well as being sensitive to steric effects on
pKa, which their purely empirical counterpart,
Epik, is not.2

QSPR-based protocols
often implement a lower level of theory than
first principles methods and are generally reliant on a number of
chemical descriptors. These descriptors are regressed against experimental
values to assemble predictive models using multiple linear regression
(MLR) or principal component regression.16−18 Univariate
regression models that rely on only one descriptor may be labelled
linear free energy relationships (LFERs). The method we propose here
falls into this latter category. Other successful attempts to predict
pKa values from one calculated descriptor
include the use of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)
atomic energy of the dissociating proton.19 Partial atomic charges of the atom bonded to the acidic proton have
also been shown to have a linear relationship with pKa.20

Here, we reintroduce
our protocol, which reveals the linear relationships
that exist between our quantum mechanically derived molecular descriptor
(bond length) and an experimental property (pKa). The ab initio bond length high correlation subset (AIBLHiCoS) method works on the basis that chemical space may be
partitioned into a series of highly correlated local linear relationships
between pKa in the solvent and a relevant
bond length in the gas phase. Membership of a compound to a subset
is governed by structural and chemical commonality, defined by structural
motifs such as tautomeric form and conformation, or the presence or
absence of substituents at a defined proximity to the acidic proton.
The existence of these relationships and simple implementation of
the linear equations describing them to predict pKa values have been demonstrated for phenols,21 naphthols,22 guanidines,23 benzoic acids and anilines,24 aryl guanidines and 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines,25 benzohydroxamic, phenylacetic, and phenoxyacetic
acids,26 bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and cubane
carboxylic acids,27 and pyridines, thiols,
and barbituric acids. We use a descriptor from a 3D structure (in
the gas phase), and so consideration of steric, intramolecular hydrogen
bonding (IHB) and π–π interactions is inherent
to the protocol within the constraints of our gas-phase model. These
structural features are known to affect the measured pKa value, and their treatment is not inherent to “two-dimensional
methods,” such as the empirical protocol employed by Marvin,
unless explicitly included in the parameterization.

The 2014
review of nine pKa prediction
packages by Settimo et al.3 found that
prediction accuracy was harder to achieve for bases than for other
weakly acidic compounds. This prompted our lab to work on the notoriously
difficult guanidine functional group.23 The work on guanidines is revisited here later at a new theory level
to predict the pKa of 12 α2-adrenoceptor antagonist phenylguanidine derivatives. A recent study25 detailed the synthesis and reported the pKa values for this set of aryl guanidines in
addition to 23 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines, using both ultraviolet
(UV)-metric and pH-metric techniques. AIBLHiCoS predictions were also
reported using a single-bond-length model, but the implementation
of the MLR model was not included. The pKa values for further five small 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines, two of
which are the marketed drugs tizanidine and apraclonidine, were also
obtained from the literature to further test the model. We also compared
our predictions to the literature values for both sites of ionization
present within a set of 10 diphenyl-based bis(2-iminoimidazolidines),
further revealing the efficacy of the method in discerning the relative
magnitude of the two microscopic dissociation constants. The 2-(arylimino)imidazolidine
derivatives studied here also contain the Y-shaped guanidine functional
group and thus may also adopt three tautomeric forms in their neutral
state. The approach to high correlation subset (HiCoS) formation for
these compounds is therefore similar to the approach described for
guanidines,23 in that the tautomeric forms
are used as a primary classifier of structural commonality.

2 Methodology
2.1 HiCoS Formation
The first stage in
the AIBLHiCoS protocol is to deduce where a so-called “active
bond” lies and in which tautomeric form and conformation it
is located. The active bond is identified by it returning superior r2, q2, and root-mean-squared-error
of estimation (RMSEE) values when regressed against pKa, compared to those of other bonds. As a descriptor,
the active bond length must reflect the implications on geometry that
a diverse array of substituent groups may impose.

Aromatic compounds
have been shown to provide a simplistic and chemically intuitive example
of how chemical space may be partitioned using the bond length as
a descriptor. Several of our studies have shown that the relationship
between the bond length and pKa for meta-
and para-substituted compounds is such that they may form their own
subset. In the case of naphthols, phenols, benzoic acids, and anilines,
the relationships established between pKa and the bond length for simple meta/para-substituted molecules provide
linear equations capable of predictions within 0.5 pKa units for more complex biomolecules. Compounds containing
ortho-substituents often fall into their own subset, where membership
to a set may be defined by the specific chemical characteristic of
the substituent group. The partitioning of ortho-substituted species
according to the chemical nature of the substituent is justified by
the propensity for IHBs between ortho-substituents and the atoms of
the ionizable group. In the presence of bulky ortho-substituents,
steric effects can impose constraints on bonding and dihedral angles
adopted by the ionizable group at the ipso carbon. This has a knock-on
effect on bond lengths, causing data points to appear as outliers
in plots of pKa versus bond length. IHBs
cause rearrangement of electron density in the region of interest,
meaning that bond lengths adjacent to where the proton is lost often
deviate from the expected trend, relative to a set of compounds absent
in the IHB interaction. This effect leads to the phenomenon of self-selection, an expression that describes how compounds
exhibiting these respective geometric features fall into their own
separate HiCoSs, at differing ranges of bond lengths or occasionally
with differing active bonds.

The identification of an optimally
predictive model is guided by
a number of internal and external validation metrics. The mathematical
formalism of the statistics used, that is, the squared correlation
coefficient r2, RMSEE, and the external
validation statistic denoted q2 (in the
form of leave-one-seventh-out), are illustrated in a previous work.21 A high r2 value
(0.9 and above) describes a strong relationship between our descriptor
and the experimental observable, but this may be misleading. Indeed,
a line of best fit connecting clusters of data points may return a
high r2 value generating a model of poor
predictivity. The latter property is best captured by the cross-validated
correlation coefficient q2 and the MAE.
A high q2 value is indicative of a highly
predictive model, and the leave-one-seventh-out protocol used here
typically overcomes the known pitfalls of the widely used leave-one-out q2. The need to overcome such deficiencies has
been demonstrated by Tropsha et al.15 Furthermore,
Roy recommends99 employing an external
dataset of at least 10 compounds as a true test of a predictive model
and advocates MAE evaluation,
taking into consideration the standard deviation of the absolute errors
(AE) as well as the range of the training set. For a model to be classed
as “good” according to Roy, it must pass the following
criteria:(i) MAE ≤ 10% of the training set
range

(ii) MAE + 3 ×
σ ≤ 20%
of the training set range (where σ is the standard deviation
of the AE).



The above validation criteria
will be used to assess the predictive
ability of the most promising models we have developed.

It must
be noted that a caveat of the current methodology (and
of all methods that use experimental values in their calibration protocol)
is its dependence on the availability of experimental data. On this
occasion, the experimental values used to calibrate the imidazolidines
model were measured at 20 °C rather than at a standard state
of 25 °C. Because of lack of other available data in aqueous
solution at 25 °C, the values from this paper28 by Timmermans and van Zwieten were used, with the possible
detriment to prediction accuracy in mind. The general trend of pKa variance with temperature for the ionizable
group in question is that there is a small decrease (0.1–0.2
pKa units) for every 5 °C increment
in the temperature. This effect is shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, which details the change
in the measured pKa for seven compounds
for the temperature range of 20–40 °C. For the diphenyl-based
bis(2-iminoimidazolidine) test compounds, the pKa data are taken from one and the same publication39 and were recorded at 30 °C. As a temperature
increase of 10 °C is expected to have a non-negligible effect
on pKa, a correction was applied to the
training set pKa values. The linear equation
describing the pKa change between 20 and
30 °C is used to correct the values of the original training
set. To enhance the model, the test set of 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines
first introduced in section 4.1.3 is also added to the initial training set, after a
correction for the temperature change from 25 to 30 °C.

The experimental values used in this work correspond to the pKa values for dissociation from the guanidinium-type
ion. However, as in the protocol described by Griffiths et al. for
guanidine derivatives,23 the bond lengths
we use as descriptors in this work correspond to the neutral, conjugate
base form.

2.2 Tautomers and Bond Lengths
Individual
HiCoSs were constructed23 by Griffiths
et al. for five bond lengths within the guanidine fragment for a training
set of compounds with chemically diverse R groups. The C=N
bond lengths in the tautomeric form A, shown in Figure 1a, returned an impressive
correlation of r2 = 0.97 with pKa. The equation describing this relationship
was tested for several drug molecules, including guanethidine, guanoxan,
and two amiloride derivatives, and gave prediction errors of less
than 0.5 pKa units. Our approach to high
correlation subset formation is guided by the parallels that may be
drawn between guanidines and 2-iminoimidazolidines in terms of their
resonance structures.

Figure 1 (a) Five conformer/tautomers considered, labelled A to E, where A&B and D&E are rotamers of the same tautomer
while
the active bond is shown in green; (b) three tautomeric forms of 2-aminoimidazoline
R-substituted derivatives (T1, T2, and T3), shown here for 2-(aminophenyl)imidazoline,
where the bond lengths under investigation are labelled a to g. The active
bonds used to form predictive models in the following sections are
again shown in bold/green.

At this point, it is fitting to clarify the nomenclature
used for
the compounds studied in the current work. Compounds represented as
tautomers T1 and T2 in Figure 1b contain an imidazoline ring (containing a C=N double
bond) bonded to an amino group at the 2-position and thus are both
referred to as 2-aminoimidazolines. When the T3 tautomer
is assumed, the five-membered ring is an imidazolidine group, and
the C=N double bond instead occurs between the carbon at the
2-position of imidazolidine and the exocyclic amino group. Such compounds
are referred to as 2-iminoimidazolidines.

The
four bonds chosen for consideration for each of the tautomers
T1, T2, and T3 are shown as a, b, c, and d in Figure 1b. For each tautomer, bonds labelled e, f, and g were also analyzed, but initial correlations obtained
were found to be inferior to the bonds of the guanidine fragment and
are not included in the discussion. Learning from past studies on
bases (i.e., guanidines and anilines29),
N–H bonds are excluded from the analysis on the basis that
correlation coefficients obtained previously were consistently poor.

3 Methods and Materials
3.1 Conformational
Analysis and Electronic Structure
Calculations
For all compounds of the imidazolidine and guanidine
training and test sets, all geometry optimization and frequency calculations
were performed in the gas phase. Previous work has shown that, according
to the assessment of HiCoS r2 values,
there is little to be gained from the use of an implicit solvent model
(CPCM), when weighed against the additional computational cost.22 Initially, the B3LYP functional with a 6-31G(d,p)
basis set was employed here, on the basis of a previous study30 from our lab. This recent study revealed that
bond lengths calculated at this level of theory produced a superior r2 value when regressed against pKa values for a HiCoS of substituted naphthols. Many of
our previous studies used geometries optimized at the HF/6-31G(d)
level to obtain equilibrium bond lengths, showing that LFERs emerge
even at low levels of theory. However, here we chose to use the split-valence
triple-zeta basis set 6-311G(d,p). Justification of this choice can
be found in section S1 of the Supporting Information.

To identify the dominant conformations of each compound in
the gas phase for each of the three tautomers, we used the “conformers
plug-in” within the Marvin Sketch7 program to generate a number of starting geometries. For each type
of mono-ortho-substituted species of the imidazolidine training set,
15 conformations were taken as input structures for optimization and
vibrational analysis using the Gaussian 09 program. The most stable
equilibrium geometries within the ensembles of each compound, in each
tautomeric form, were then identified by a comparison of total ab
initio energies. As the ortho-groups are identical for each of the
2,6-di-ortho-compounds of the training set, degenerate conformations
are expected because of the inherent symmetry of the system. These
compounds also exhibit a lower degree of conformational flexibility
than their mono-ortho-substituted analogue because of restricted rotation
around C1–N1 and N1–C7 (illustrated for T3 in Figure 2). Noting these inherent geometric features, all 2,6-di-ortho
compounds were optimized from an input geometry suspected to be close
to their most stable form, whereby the two rings are orthogonal with
respect to each other. For each mono-ortho-substituted species, optimization
from an input geometry with orthogonal orientation of the two rings
was also carried out. This separate optimization was performed to
assess the effect of conformational commonality on the LFERs produced
from our training set, which, as will be discussed, has limited variation
with respect to substitution patterns.

angles describing the orientation of the imidazolidine ring relative
to the phenyl ring defined as D1 (C2–C1–N1–C7) and D2 (C1–N1–C7–N2).
For compounds substituted at one ortho-position, the D1 angle is measured
with C2 denoting the carbon bonded to that substituent.

HF/6-31G(d) optimized structures
of guanidine training set compounds
from the previous study were reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory. This reoptimization was carried out for each compound
in each of the five conformer/tautomer forms defined in the previous
paper23 and which are shown in Figure 1a. The pKa data for further six small guanidine derivatives were
obtained and optimized in each tautomer/conformer combination. Frequency
calculations were carried out using the same level of theory for optimization,
and inspection of the Hessian confirmed the absence of imaginary frequencies
and the location of energy minima.

3.2 Construction
of Models
Relevant bond
lengths were extracted (seven bonds a–g for imidazolidines and five labelled i–v for guanidines) from all optimized structures of the tautomerically
distinct subsets. The values of r2, RMSEE,
and leave-one-seventh-out q2 were obtained
using the program31 SIMCA-P 10.0 following
linear regression of each type of bond length versus aqueous pKa values. The coefficients of the three-bond-length
MLR model were also obtained using the SIMCA-P program. For all test
set compounds, the most stable geometries were ascertained for each
of the tautomeric forms using the Marvin conformer search protocol
described above, where for the diphenyl-based bis(2-iminoimidazolidines),
the number of conformers generated was increased to 25. The appropriate
bond length was then extracted and inserted into the HiCoS equation
[pKa = m × (bond
length) + c] or MLR equation for the models deemed
to be optimally predictive according to internal and external validation
statistics.

3.3 Interatomic Exchange–Correlation
Energy
Calculations
Bond lengths by themselves do not reveal their
degree of covalency by their mere value. Covalency is essentially
a measure of electronic delocalization, which can be calculated within
the context of a topological energy partitioning method called interacting
quantum atoms (IQA).32 Originating from
the QTAIM,33,34 IQA is an increasingly popular
tool to analyze a large variety of chemical phenomena. By partitioning
the total energy of a system into intra- and interatomic terms, we
derive a quantitative measure of covalent-like interactions between
atoms in the molecules. This measure comes in the form of the exchange–correlation
potential energy VxcAB, which is the sum of the exchange energy VxAB and the correlation energy VcAB. The former term usually dominates VxcAB and denotes the Fock–Dirac exchange, which describes the
ever-reducing probability of finding two electrons of the same spin
close to one another (i.e., the Fermi hole). The latter term, VcAB, is associated with the Coulomb hole and the electrostatic repulsion
between the electrons. The absolute value of VxcAB evaluated between
two atoms can be taken as the extent of delocalization of electrons
between them, a factor that also determines the bond distance. The
values for the exchange–correlation energy between C and N
(denoted VxcCN) were obtained by the AIMAll program35 (version 14.11.23), using the first-ever36 DFT-compatible IQA partitioning and using default
parameters on wave functions obtained at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level.
Note that the VxcCN values are always negative, and the more
negative they are, the more covalent is the interaction between C
and N.

3.4 Experimental Data
Compounds of the
training set are labelled 1–23 and can be found
in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. The structural diversity of these compounds in terms of substitution
pattern is fairly low. There are 14 compounds of the set that possess
two ortho-substituents, 9 of which have two identical o-halogen groups
(both are either F, Cl, or Br), whereas the other 5 have two identical
o-alkyl groups (either Me or Et). Eight compounds of the training
set have only one ortho-substituent, three of which have an o-methyl
group and five have an o-chloro group. Meta- and para-substituents
are also present on the phenyl group of 15 o-substituted compounds
of the set. The only compound of the set lacking any ortho-substituents
is the unsubstituted form (shown in Figure 2 as tautomer T3), which will be referred
to as compound 23.

The test compounds discussed
in sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 were synthesized previously, as
reported by Rozas and co-workers (ph1–ph10 and py1–py7)37,38 and Dardonville and
co-workers (ph11–ph15, 1, 2a,b–5a,b, and 6h).25,39 The substitution patterns of the test set include meta- and para-substituted
compounds. The pKa values were measured
by both the potentiometric (pH-metric) and spectrophotometric (UV-metric)
methods of pKa determination. It is pH-metric
values that are used for comparison to theoretical predictions for ph1–ph15 and py1–py7 in section 4.1.3, whereas
both UV- and pH-metric values are used for comparison in section 4.1.4. Further
details on the methods used for pKa determination
can be found in section S2 of the Supporting Information.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Imidazolidines
4.1.1 Conformation and Commonality
In
a previous work, we have demonstrated the existence of conformation-specific
linear relationships between the bond length and pKa. For instance, we illustrated that two subsets are formed
using the same interatomic bonding distance for a series of ortho-substituted
naphthols, when the O–H group is either syn or anti with respect to the ortho-substituent.22 Consequently, bond lengths later used to predict
unknown pKa values must be extracted from
the compound in the specific tautomer/conformer combination used to
form the predictive equation. Therefore, insertion of an O–H
bond length from a syn conformer into the anti HiCoS equation, or vice versa, would likely return
a poor prediction. Figure 2 illustrates the two torsional angles that define the orientation
of the imidazolidine group relative to the phenyl ring: D1 (C2–C1–N1–C7) and D2 (C1–N1–C7–N2). Structures labelled T1 and T2 in Figure 1b may be considered
as two rotamers of the same tautomer. For these rotamers, interconversion
is achieved through 180° rotation of the imidazolidine group
around the N1–C7 bond (i.e., by torsion
angle D2 over bond c).

In each
tautomeric form (i.e., T1, T2, and T3), the most stable conformation
identified for compounds with a single ortho-alkyl group is one in
which the imidazolidine ring is tilted from orthogonality with the
phenyl ring, away from the o-alkyl group (i.e., if the substituent
is at C6, D1 > 90°). In the T2 form, the two rings
are found to be nearly completely coplanar, with average D1 and D2
angles of 177° and −1°. The enhanced stability afforded
to this arrangement is presumably a consequence of minimized steric
interactions with the alkyl group. Compounds of the training set with
two o-alkyl substituents are found to adopt a geometry, whereby the
two rings are more or less orthogonal in tautomers T1, T2, and T3.

For 2,6-dihalogens in the T3 form, the most stable orientation
of the two rings is one whereby an N–H group of imidazolidine
is orientated toward one of the ortho-substituents on the phenyl (i.e.,
D1 < 90°). This feature is most pronounced for the 2,6-di-fluoro
derivative, compound 15, for which D1 is ∼50°.
This small D1 angle is indicative of the presence of an IHB interaction
between an N–H of imidazoline/imidazolidine and the fluorine
atom. Further analyses were performed using the IQA topological energy
partitioning scheme, which revealed a (3, −1) bond critical
point between (N)–H and F for compound 15 in tautomer
T3. A full explanation of the IQA analysis and further evidence for
the presence of the NH···F hydrogen bond for compound 15 in both tautomers T1 and T3 can be found in section S3
of the Supporting Information.

The
next class of training set compounds to consider are species
that have a chlorine atom occupying one ortho-position while the remaining
ortho-position is unsubstituted. When the amino-type tautomer T1 is
assumed, the most stable geometry is one in which the imidazoline
group is orientated away from the ortho-chloro group. If the same
class of compound is instead represented as T2, a preference for almost
absolute coplanarity is observed, illustrated by averaged D1 and D2
angles of around 178° and −1°, respectively. In contrast
to the observations made for T1, the most stable arrangement for T3
is one in which the N–H of the imidazolidine group is oriented
toward the chlorine atom. An IQA analysis of compounds 5 and 7 (the 2,4-chloro and 2,5-chloro derivatives) in
their most stable conformation of tautomer T3 reveals no BCP for N–H···Cl.
Therefore, the propensity to adopt this conformation cannot be ascribed
to the presence of an IHB.

The commonly visited geometries of
compound 23 [2-(phenylimino)imidazolidine]
will be quite similar to those identified for any other compounds
substituted at the meta- and/or para-positions for small substituent
groups. This may be asserted because of the infeasibility of significant
through-space interactions between imidazoline and these groups at
the more distant meta- and para-positions. Consequently, inclusion
of this compound within the training set of a model will ensure that
the applicability domain encompasses compounds without ortho-substituents.
For T2, one dominant conformation is identified, within which the
two rings lie almost exactly coplanar, akin to all mono-ortho-substituted
derivatives in this form. An IQA analysis was performed to assess
the reasons for the enhanced stability of the coplanar conformation
for T2 and can be found in section S4 of the Supporting Information. For the T1 tautomer, there is also one dominant
conformation that corresponds to a structure with a D1 angle of 160°
and a D2 dihedral of −12°. For T3, there are two conformations
that have similar D1 and D2 angles but differ by the orientations
of the hydrogen atoms of the N–H groups, with a difference
in stability of only ∼1 kJ mol–1. In the
analysis below, only the bond lengths of the most stable T3 conformers
are considered.

So far, we have identified preferred conformations
for the compounds
of our training set in each tautomeric form, which has revealed a
degree of commonality for subsets of compounds possessing similar
substituent patterns. We also observed an anomalous geometry due to
an IHB for the 2,6-F2 derivative (compound 15), which is likely to be a common feature among other 2-F-substituted
compounds. We are now in a position to construct plots from the constituent
bond lengths of each compound and assess how LFERs emerge for each
bond. In the following analysis, we include bond lengths from the
2-substituted species in their most stable conformations of T1 and
T2 and also from a geometry that more closely resembles the orthogonal
orientation of the 2,6-substituted compounds. This is performed to
assess whether conformational congruence is indeed the guiding factor
to HiCoS formation or simply whether the most stable, and therefore,
the most commonly visited geometries provide bond lengths that have
the strongest linear relationships with pKa values.

4.1.2 Identification of HiCoSs
In the
search for a predictive model for 2-(phenylimino)imidazolidines, our
initial motivation was to formulate a model using bond lengths from
the most commonly visited forms of each compound of our training set.
According to chemical intuition, within the constraints of our gas
phase and static model, an active bond should be located within the
most commonly visited state, that is, the lowest energy conformation
of the most stable tautomeric form. Furthermore, in accordance with
the results for other aromatic species, we may then expect to find
that subsets form, where membership to a given subset is defined by
the location of a substituent at the ortho- or meta- and para-positions
on the phenyl group.

In the most stable conformation of each
of their tautomeric forms, the “imino” tautomer (T3),
where the C=N double bond is present between the imidazolidine
and the phenyl rings, is consistently more stable than either of the
T1 and T2 rotamers (internal energy rankings can be found in Table S2). This energy ranking is consistent
for a comparison of Gibbs energies. Plotting bond lengths a–d versus pKa, with the 23 training set compounds in their most stable
conformation of the T3 tautomer, reveals strong, individual linear
relationships for all bonds (r2 = 0.946,
0.944, 0.830, and 0.960 for a–d, respectively). However, for bonds a and b (the
endocyclic C–N bonds of the guanidine fragment), one obvious
outlier is observed in each case. These anomalous bond lengths are
identified as belonging to compound 15, 2-(2,6-difluorophenylimino)imidazolidine
(blue circles in Figure 3). We may explain the occurrence of this outlier by the presence
of the IHB we described above, which perturbs the electron density
distribution between atoms and causes a more extreme distortion of
the geometry than that observed for the 2-chloro-substituted anologues.
We may justify the removal of this compound from the set because compound 15 lacks conformational commonality with the rest of the set.
If enough data for other ortho-fluoro-compounds were available, then
we surmise based on a previous work, that a separate HiCoS would be
identified for bonds a and b, consisting of compounds that have this intramolecular
interaction in common. There is only one other compound with pKa data available: the 2-F,6-Cl-phenyl analogue.
As expected, this second 2-F derivative exhibits a conformation very
similar to compound 15 (D1 = 51°) and also appears
below the trend line for bonds a and b, next to compound 15 (orange
triangles in Figure 3). However, deriving a new HiCoS equation from two data points is
unlikely to provide a meaningful relationship, thus rendering an all-encompassing,
single-bond-length model using a or b as unfeasible. Removal of compound 15 reduces the training set to 22 congeners and reveals r2 values of 0.973 for bond a, 0.969 for b, 0.836 for c, and 0.959 for d, as shown in Table 1, thus making bond a the active
bond for all compounds contained in the training set, except for 2-F
derivatives.

Inspection of the plots
for bonds a and d in Figure 3 reveals that the unsubstituted compound 23 falls in
the correct regions to be conducive of a linear
relationship between the bond length and pKa in both cases. However, 23 may be considered an outlier
in the case of plot b, as removal of
this compound from the set causes an increase in r2 from 0.969 to 0.981. Bond c of 23 seems to fall in a bond length range mostly occupied
by mono-ortho-substituted compounds, but it is apparent that the overall r2 and q2 values
for the LFER model derived from the C=N bond are lower and
the RMSEE value is higher when compared to all other models. The commonly
visited geometries of compound 23 (2-(phenylimino)imidazolidine)
will be quite similar to those identified for any other compounds
substituted at the meta- and/or para-positions for small substituent
groups. This may be asserted because of the infeasibility of significant
through-space interactions between imidazoline and these groups at
the more distant meta- and para-positions. The fact that compound 23 does not appear as an outlier for the linear fit of bonds a and d versus
pKa suggests that they may have the largest
applicability radius out of the four single-bond-length models.

Referring to the validation statistics listed in the lower part
of Table 1 where compound 15 has been excluded, the a model
demonstrates marginally superior r2, q2, and RMSEE values over the other bonds. However,
we may conclude that for the most stable conformer and tautomeric
form of the phenyl-substituted 2-iminoimidazolidines of the training
set, a linear relationship exists between each of
the four bond lengths a–d and pKa. Shorter C–N bonds a, b, and d and a longer C=N bond c are all molecular features indicative
of a lower aqueous pKa value and thus
increased acidity. In other words, in the case of 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines,
there is a concerted change in four gas-phase bonding distances in
the region of the guanidine skeleton because of substituent effects
on the phenyl group, which is linked to the thermodynamic feasibility
of the guanidine group losing a proton in the aqueous phase. In terms
of the dissociation equilibrium reaction in the static T3 state, the
nitrogen of the C=N c bond is
the site of proton loss or acceptance. Considering this point, it
is then unclear as to why we observe a stronger or more sensitive
reflection of proton loss/acceptance feasibility in the changing C–N
bonding distances of a, b, and d compared to
the relationship observed for the C=N bond c. These results for 2-(arylimino)imidazolidines differ from
our findings for the previous study on simple guanidines and from
the results described in section 4.2.1, where we find that only the C=N bond lengths of a specific conformation of a higher
energy tautomer correlate highly with aqueous pKa values (shown in Figure 1a).

In light of the existence of more than one
“active bond,”
MLR analysis was performed for bonds a, b, and d versus pKa on the grounds that their
individual r2 and q2 values are in excess of 0.95. The c bonds were excluded, as a detrimental effect on MLR validation
metrics can be expected in accordance with the inferior (r2 and q2 < 0.9) single-bond-length
values shown in Table 1. This new model, where pKa is now defined
as a function of three bonds, exhibits superior validation statistics
when compared to any single-bond-length model (Table 1). The removal of the anomalously long bonds
of compound 15 from the training set revealed a further
increase in r2 and notably an increase
in q2 of 0.12 in addition to a 0.05 reduction
in RMSEE.

For the higher energy tautomeric forms, T1 and T2,
we observe no
other superior set of r2, q2, and RMSEE values for the training set in their most
stable conformations, compared to those observed for T3 a (Table 2). In the case of T2, the bond length versus pKa plots reveal that for a highly correlated model to be
constructed using all compounds, each mono-ortho-substituted compound
must occupy a higher energy conformation, whereby the two rings are
arranged orthogonally. Separate HiCoSs are formed in the case of each
bond, when the bond lengths of the more stable, more coplanar conformers
of mono-ortho-compounds are plotted against their pKa values. Therefore, for T2, inducing conformational commonality
is the guiding factor for a strong LFER; indeed the r2, q2, and RMSEE values for
bonds a, c, and d in the same orthogonal conformation
are indicative of an almost perfect linear relationship. The new subsets
constructed from the bond lengths of the coplanar conformers are found
to run almost parallel to the full set containing the orthogonally
arranged analogues (Figure S1) and also
have high r2 values. The formation of
new HiCoSs according to conformational congruence is also observed
in the case of bond lengths c and d for T1 (Figure S2).

a “Most stable”
refers
to the models formed with 2,6-di-ortho-compounds plus the more stable
coplanar conformers of the mono-ortho-compounds. “Same conf”
refers to models where mono-ortho-compounds are optimized from an
orthogonal orientation of the two rings, so as to match that of the
2,6-di-ortho-substituted compounds (i.e., all compounds optimized
from the same conformation). Compound 23 falls within
the “most stable” set as it did not optimize to a local
minimum with an orthogonal geometry. Corresponding plots are shown
in Figures S1 and S2, whereas Tables S5 and S6 show bond lengths and angles
D1 and D2.

Although inducing
a conformational agreement between doubly and
singly ortho-substituted compounds appears to allow for a linear relationship
to reveal itself for the T1/T2 forms, it also introduces a layer of
unnecessary complexity to a prediction protocol. This complexity arises
because successful implementation of the equations describing these
relationships to predict pKa values is
dependent on the compounds’ propensity to take up a prescribed
conformation. The problematic nature of this condition is exposed
for compound 23 as T2, for which the only equilibrium
geometry located exhibits an almost exactly coplanar orientation of
the two rings (D1 = 175° and D2 = 0.3°). Correspondingly,
for plots a–d for T2, compound 23 is found to belong to the new HiCoSs
containing only the more stable, coplanar conformers, for which bonds a and c are
found to give the highest r2 values of
0.97 and 0.96 (Figure S1). This suggests
that a route may be taken whereby doubly ortho-compounds are predicted
with one model, and singly ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted species
are predicted with T2 a or c. However, the smaller pKa range of 2.06 for the T2 a HiCoS is
a detrimental factor to its implementation for compounds with a wide
range of substituents, when compared to the larger range of the T3
models.

In the following sections, we proceed to make predictions
for two
external test sets, first by application of the single-bond-length
models a, b, and d for T3 and by application of
the three-bond-length model for T3, where the bonds of compound 15 are excluded. By comparison of the error statistics, we
arrive at a protocol capable of a highly accurate pKa prediction for the guanidine group of 2-(arylimino)imidazolidine
derivatives, which is proven to be sensitive to a diverse array of
substituent effects.

4.1.3 External Test Set: 2-(Phenylimino)
and 2-(Pyridylimino)imidazolidines
The a bond lengths of the most stable
conformers identified for 27 compounds represented as T3 were inserted
into the equation (i.e., pKa = 272.76
× r(a) –
368.08), which corresponds to the optimally predictive single-bond-length
model identified in section 4.1.2. The equations for the models derived using bonds b and d (pKa = 310.49 × r(b) − 421.74 and pKa = 99.03 × r(d) – 128.88, respectively) were also implemented for the same test set.
All single-bond-length predictions and error statistics referred to
in this discussion can be found in Table S7 of the Supporting Information.

The MAE value of the a model was found to be the lowest at 0.26, with
a standard deviation of AE (σ) of 0.23. Whereas a reasonable
performance is observed using the d model
equation (MAE = 0.57, σ = 0.53), the b model performed very badly (MAE = 1.54, σ = 2.47).
The poor performance of the b and d models can be mainly attributed to large
prediction errors for compounds py4–py7, which
correspond to four 2-pyridyl derivatives (structures are shown in Table 3). For example, the
errors for bond b for these four compounds
are −7.49, −7.24, −7.28, and −7.31. These
very low predictions can be attributed to a significant shortening
of the b bond, which equates to a ∼−0.03
Å difference relative to those of 3-pyridyl analogues. The d bond lengths also experience this shortening
effect but to a lesser degree, as illustrated by the lower prediction
errors of −1.79, −1.65, −1.76, and −1.66.
However, the a bond lengths show no
substantial deviation from the bond length range observed for the
training set compounds, and consequently, the errors for py4–py7 are dramatically lower (−0.27,+0.01, −0.07, and −0.46).
Inspection of the most stable equilibrium geometries identified for
these compounds reveals the presence of an IHB interaction, which
lies between the N–H of imidazolidine and the heteroatom at
the 2-position of the six-membered ring. The existence of this IHB
may be evidenced first (tenuously) by the presence of a (3, −1)
bond critical point between the imidazolidine H and the N atom of
pyridine in the most stable geometries of py4–py7 and second by the analysis of VxcHN and VxcNN values. The
above terms correspond to the HN and NN exchange–correlation
energies calculated for py4–py7, where VxcHN denotes the (N)–H···N interaction and VxcNN denotes the N(−H)···N interaction. The average
magnitude of these values is even larger than that calculated for
the constituent atoms of the IHB found in the most stable conformer
of compound 15 (T3), equating to ∼−47 kJ
mol–1 for VxcHN and ∼37 kJ mol–1 for VxcNN. When these four 2-pyridyl compounds are
excluded, the MAE and σ values are significantly reduced to
0.53 and 0.25 for the b model, and 0.37
and 0.23 for d. However, as the superior
validation statistics derived in the previous section suggest, the a model predictions are consistently more
accurate, with an MAE of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.24 for
the remaining 23 compounds.

shown for further five literature compounds: tizanidine (Tiz),40 apraclonidine (Apra),41 and AG3–AG5.42 Predictions for compounds py4–py7 were made by implementation of the a model, that is, pKa = 272.76 × r(a) – 368.08, and
are denoted by (a). Predictions and
AE obtained using ChemAxon using both T1 and T3 as input structures
are also shown for comparison, where asterisks denote predictions
where the Marvin program recognized the T3 form as the dominant tautomer.

Although the averaged error
for the test set predictions using
the a model is impressively low, there
are some compounds of the set that show significant errors, namely, ph11 (−0.70), ph13 (−0.82), and
to a lesser extent, ph15 (−0.64). These errors
correspond to the compounds 2-(4-nitrophenylimino)-, 2-(3-chloro,4-nitrophenylimino)-,
and 2-(3-fluoro,4-nitrophenylimino)imidazolidine, and therefore, all
three contain a nitro group at the para position. The strong, resonance-induced
electron-withdrawing effect of p-nitro groups is evidenced by their
measured pKa values, which indicate a
reduction in the basicity of ∼2 pKa units for all nitro compounds (ph11–ph15), relative
to the unsubstituted form (23). The prediction errors
for the three problematic nitro compounds are somewhat reduced by
use of the b model (+0.58, +0.40, and
+0.70), but significant improvement is found by use of the d model, for which the predicted values are found
to be a mere −0.23, −0.05, and +0.10 pKa units outside of the experiment. It is interesting to
note that compounds ph12 and ph14 also contain
a p-nitro group, but show consistently low errors for all three single-bond-length
models (Table S7). The reason for the lower
errors for ph12 and ph14 may lie in the
fact that these compounds also have o-halogen substituents in addition
to the p-nitro group, and thus share more structural commonality with
the compounds used to calibrate the models.

With the introduction
of our test set, we notice that certain phenyl
substituents, like the ortho-fluoro groups of compound 15, can perturb bond lengths a, b, and d to
varying degrees, meaning that outliers are found to be inconsistent
between single-bond-length models. This is not a surprising observation;
but subsequently, to derive a pKa prediction
protocol that is both highly accurate and consistent in its accuracy,
we must go from one single-bond-model to another to minimize overall
prediction errors.

The resultant predictive equation for the
MLR of bonds a, b, and d against pKa is expressed
as follows: pKa = 92.511 × r(a) + 105.33 × r(b) + 33.596 × r(d) – 311.79. Implementation
of this equation to predict for all 27 test set compounds revealed
it to be inferior in terms of overall accuracy relative to the single-bond-length
model a (MAE = 0.63, σ = 1.08).
However, this high mean error can again be solely attributed to poor
predictions for the 2-pyridyl compounds, which show errors of −3.24,
−3.01, −3.09, and −3.21 for py4–py7. Excluding the errors of the 2-pyridyl derivatives reveals an improvement
in the prediction accuracy over the use of the a model for the remaining compounds, as the MAE falls to 0.20
and notably, the standard deviation of errors is reduced to just 0.18.
In noting the sensitivity of the b and d bonds to the presence of the IHB of 2-pyridyl
compounds, it appears that the optimal protocol for the pKa prediction of this class of derivatives should be via
implementation of the a model equation.
For compounds that lack the heteroatom at the 2-position of the aryl
group, implementation of the MLR three-bond-length model will likely
provide the most consistently accurate predictions. Because of a lack
of pKa data at this time, it is not possible
to say how this protocol will fare when the phenyl group is replaced
by other aryl groups containing heteroatoms. However, the respectable
errors obtained for compounds without ortho-substituents, for 3-pyridyls
and for the drug tizanidine (Tiz) (which has a piazthiole
derivative instead of Ph), hint at an applicability radius much wider
than just the simple o-substituted phenyl derivatives that make up
the training set.

The predictions shown in Table 3 were made using the MLR model,
with the exception
of the 2-pyridyl compounds, which, for reasons explained above, were
made using the a bond model. The MAE
for the full AIBLHiCoS protocol pKa predictions
for the 27 compounds shown in Table 3 is 0.20, with a standard deviation of AE of 0.18.

A high degree of prediction accuracy in modern terms may be considered
as within 1 pKa unit per prediction, with
a MAE for a test set of less than 0.5 units.2 According to these conditions, the error statistics (MAE = 0.20,
σ = 0.18) indicate that AIBLHiCoS performs very well and does
so consistently. For predictions made using the pKa predictor plug-in within the Marvin Suite by ChemAxon,7 with the imino tautomer (T3) as the input structure,
eight prediction errors exceed 1.0 pKa units (ph8, ph9, ph11 to ph15, and py1), and the MAE value is in excess
of 0.5 units (0.72). This value deteriorates further when T1 is used
as an input structure, for which 11 errors exceed 1 pKa unit. The MAE of 0.97 for T1 shown in Table 3 is inclusive of the error values
for ph11–ph15, for which the program implicitly
recognizes the dominant tautomeric form as T3. Therefore, on the basis
of our energy rankings (Table S3), optimal
prediction accuracy is dependent on the user having prior knowledge
about the dominant tautomeric form. The AIBLHiCoS protocol we have
developed for these compounds finds its place here as a useful tool
for predicting subtle substituent effects on pKa with a high accuracy. Conversely, the wider applicability
radius of the Marvin program means it demonstrates lower prediction
accuracy in the case of these compounds.

According to Roy’s
stringent assessment of a QSPR/quantitative
structure–activity relationship model, the predictions made
using the MLR model may be classed as “good” in his
own parlance, that is, the MAE of 0.20 is smaller than 10% of the
training set range (0.39 units) and the MAE + 3 × σ (0.20
+ 3 × 0.18) is 0.74 and therefore lower than 20% of the training
set range (0.78).

We now discuss the exchange–correlation
measure VxcCN introduced in the Computational Methods section 3. Figure 4a–d shows the relationship
between the VxcCN values corresponding to the CN interactions
for each of the bond
lengths a–d and
the pKa values. Referring to the r2 values on plots (a–d), which are for
the training set compounds only (blue diamonds), remarkably strong
linear relationships are observed in the case of all four CN bonds.
Taking the VxcCN value as a more physically meaningful metric,
the greater the exchange–correlation energy between the constituent
atoms of the C=N bond c, along
with a lesser interaction energy between the atoms of the three C–N
bonds a, b, and d adjacent to it, the more basic
the guanidine group. Furthermore, plots of how the VxcCN values
of the training set correlate with their corresponding bond lengths
reveal r2 values of 0.990, 0.871, 0.869,
and 0.989 for a–d. Thus, although the bond length is not necessarily a measure of
covalency, it is a measure in the case of the 23 training set compounds
and most strongly for bonds a and d. This observation therefore heightens the
significance of our bond length versus pKa LFERs, that is, the most active bond lengths a and d (which exhibit the superior
validation statistics r2, q2, and RMSEE) most strongly reflect the extent of delocalization
between the two bonded atoms.

Figure 4 (a–d) Plots of VxcCN vs pKa for
bonds a–d, showing
the outliers to be consistent with the analogous bond length vs pKa LFERs. The r2 values
correspond to training set compounds only. Values are listed in Table S8.

As the VxcCN values of a and d are very accurately reflected
in the corresponding calculated bond distances, compounds ph11, ph13, and ph15 (purple triangles in Figure 4) once again appear
as outliers for a but not for d. For the 2-pyridyl compounds py4–py7 (red circles), the presence of the IHB is seen to cause divergence
of the VxcCN values of b, c, and d from the linear trends that reflect the most substituent effects
with impressive accuracy, leading to the formation of new HiCoSs.
Accurate pKa prediction would be therefore
be possible by the use of the linear equations describing the relationships
shown in Figure 4a–d,
where calculated VxcCN values are used in place of bond lengths.
The latter alternative prediction method could follow a procedure
similar to the one described above for bond lengths. Specifically,
the MLR model could be used to predict for substituted phenyl or 3-pyridyl
compounds, but the aVxcCN model
must again be used for 2-pyridyl compounds, as they belong to separate
HiCoSs.

As the internal and external validation metrics for
the bond length
models are already impressive, it is likely that there is little to
be gained from a protocol that uses VxcCN as molecular
descriptors, when weighed against the added computational cost involved
in calculating them. However, it is interesting to note that the highest r2 value for VxcCN values versus pKa is now found for bond c, which is the C=N double bond. Figure 4 shows that the VxcCN values for both
CN bonds adjacent to the site of ionization (c and d) are both highly correlated
with the ionization feasibility. As the extent of delocalization increases
between atoms of bond c and decreases
for the atoms of bond d, the ability
of the conjugate guanidinium-type cation to stabilize the positive
charge increases. This finding is perhaps more in line with chemical
intuition than what we observe for the bond lengths, where the C=N
bond gives the worst r2, q2, and RMSEE values when regressed against pKa.

Notwithstanding the dramatic increase in r2 from 0.83 to 0.98 for bond c by use of the corresponding VxcCN values, Figure 4 also shows no substantial
deterioration
for other bonds. In fact, all VxcCN versus pKa plots show r2 values above 0.9.
The interatomic property, VxcAB, as a measure of delocalization of
electrons between two atoms, is related to the delocalization index,
a QTAIM-derived metric that describes the number of shared or exchanged
electrons between two QTAIM atoms. Work43−45 by Matta and co-workers
has implemented delocalization indices, along with localization indices
(a measure of electrons localized within a QTAIM atom), to define
a series of compounds as what they call a ζ-matrix. The authors
showed43 that the Frobenius distances between
the elements of the matrix representations of a set of p-benzoic acids containing only delocalization indices
and that of a reference species with the lowest pKa value show a high r2 value
when regressed against their pKa values.
Significantly, the distances between the submatrices representing
just the [COOH] molecular fragment were found to give a higher correlation
with pKa than the [OH] submatrices. This
is rationalized by the fact that the pKa value reflects the ability of the COOH fragment to accommodate ionization.
Comparisons may therefore be drawn between this study and the current
work, where using VxcCN, we see that each bonding interaction of
the guanidine fragment correlates with pKa. This observation may be rationalized by the fact that the pKa values for our 2-iminoimidazolidines reflect
the thermodynamic feasibility of the whole guanidine fragment to accommodate
the positive charge.

4.1.4 External Test Set: Bis(2-iminoimidazolidines)
To test the robustness of the AIBLHiCoS protocol described above
for larger, more conformationally flexible species, the pKa values for a series of diphenyl-based bis(2-iminoimidazolidine)
compounds were taken as a new test set (Table 4). These compounds contain two 2-(phenylimino)imidazolidine
moieties linked by an amide bond at the para-positions, for which
the two guanidine-type sites of ionization exhibit distinct pKa values. As the values obtained by Ríos
Martínez et al.39 were measured
at a nonstandard temperature of 30 °C, the values of the training
set were adjusted to account for the expected deviation in pKa. Initial training set values (1–23) were adjusted using a correction from 20 to 30 °C, and for
consistency, the former test set (ph1 through py7) values were adjusted using the appropriate equation for an increase
from 25 to 30 °C. The dataset of guanidine-containing compounds
used to approximate the pKa change is
shown in Table S1 of the Supporting Information, and the new values for the enhanced training set are shown in Table S9. Both the a model and the three-bond-length MLR model formed using a, b, and d bond lengths were implemented to assess their relative
accuracy for this new test set. The bond lengths of the 2-pyridyl
compounds (py4–py7) and those of the three other
largest outliers identified in the previous section (ph11, ph13, and ph15) were removed from the
new training set on the basis that they belong to a separate HiCoS
for these specific bonds.

a UV-metric values were recorded at
30 °C, and both the AIBLHiCoS and ChemAxon predictions were adjusted
accordingly, where the AIBLHiCoS equation implemented was pKa30 = 86.34 × r(a) + 90.40 × r(b) + 34.08 × r(c) – 283.43. The
pH-metric experimental values correspond to a temperature of 25 °C,
and the predicted values are made using the equation pKa25 = 92.31 × r(a) + 96.00 × r(b) + 36.77 × r(c) – 303.02. The
pH-metric values for 4b and 5b are missing
because of insufficient sample quantities.

All results shown in Table 4 correspond to predictions made using the
MLRs for both temperatures,
as they were both found to provide lower overall errors and standard
deviation of errors when compared to the a models (Table S10). The upper part of Table 4 (corresponding to
the UV-metric values of Ríos Martínez et
al.39) demonstrates a poor performance
for the AIBLHiCoS model, which shows an MAE of 0.41 and a standard
deviation of 0.59 for the 20 sites of ionization. Notably, the prediction
errors for compound 6h are huge (pKa(1) = +0.88 and pKa(2) = +2.56).
These large errors cannot be attributed to the lack of training for
species containing pyridines, as there are three 3-pyridyl species
(py1–py3) present within the enhanced training
set. Furthermore, as the predicted values for the majority of the
congeneric species in Table 4 show errors below the 0.5 log unit threshold, we cannot rationalize
the highly inaccurate predictions for both pKa(1) and pKa(2) of 6h and 5a pKa(2) by the approximate
nature of the temperature corrections applied to the training set
data.

On the basis of the success of the MLR model for the test
compounds
described in the previous section, the reliability of the UV-metric
values was questioned. Subsequently, new pH-metric measurements were
obtained for all compounds for which adequate sample quantity was
available. These new pH-metric values were recorded at the standard
25 °C. Unfortunately, new measurements for 4b and 5b were not possible because of insufficient sample quantities.

The new predictions and pH-metric values are shown in the lower
part of Table 4, and
a comparison of error evaluation statistics is summarized in Table 5. Comparing the new
predictions at 25 °C to the pH-metric values, the unsigned errors
for 6h are now only 0.37 and 0.33 pKa units away from the experiment, proving the
previously reported experimental values to be erroneous.
The prediction error for 5a pKa(2) is now also below 0.5 units and closer in magnitude to that of the
chemically similar pKa(1) site of 2a. All prediction errors are now found to be below 0.5.

a The number
of “outliers”
corresponds to the number of prediction errors exceeding 0.5 units.

Implementation of Roy’s
criteria to assess prediction errors
against the pH-metric values indicates that the model may be classified
as “good,” that is, the MAE of 0.27 is smaller than
10% of the training set range (0.37) and the MAE + 3 × σ
(0.27 + 3 × 0.10) is 0.56 and therefore lower than 20% of the
training set range (0.74). The MAE values produced utilizing Marvin
exceed 1 log unit for both the UV-metric values at 30 °C and
pH-metric values at 25 °C. Notably, 19 out of 20 values exhibit
errors of more than 0.5 units for the UV-metric values, and 14 out
of 18 for the pH-metric values. Further, the order of microdissociation
steps for sites (1) and (2), described by the relative magnitude of
the two measured pKa values, is correct
on every occasion for AIBLHiCoS but is incorrect for 5a and 6h for the predictions made by Marvin’s
pKa predictor (of ChemAxon).

4.2 Guanidines
4.2.1 HiCoSs from Tautomers
It has already
been established23 that for guanidines,
distinct HiCoSs may be formed by representing compounds in specific
conformations of each tautomeric form. We have also proven that this
approach to HiCoS formation is successful for 2-iminoimidazolidines.
In the case of the imidazolidines discussed in the previous section,
the most highly predictive model was formed using a bond distance
within the most stable tautomer. For guanidines where substitution
only occurs at one amino/imino group, previous work details the formation
of a model using the C=N bond lengths of equilibrium geometries
of compounds in a higher energy tautomeric state. The purpose of the
current section is to prove that the model already established in
the previous work still functions as a predictive model for a new
test set, as we shift the level of theory from our previous CPU-triggered
HF/6-31G(d) level to the current B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. Because
this section of the work on guanidines has already been discussed
in the paper by Griffiths et al., further details can be found in
section 2.3 of that paper.23

Several
changes have been made to the previous training set to form the model
used in this work. First, eight new guanidine derivatives were added
during recalibration to further corroborate the location of the active
bond. Second, some pKa values used here
differ from those used previously. For guanidine itself, we use a
value of 13.6 as per the Foye’s Principles of Medicinal Chemistry.46 A value47 of 8.23
also replaces that previously used for acetylguanidine. Both of these
new values are reported to have been measured at 25 °C and are
lower by 0.1 units than the values used in the guanidine model previously,
which were taken from a study by Albert et al.48 and reported to have been measured at 20 °C.

Five candidates for the active bond were chosen as N–H,
C=N, C–N, C–N, and N–H, which correspond
to those marked respectively as i–v in Figure 1a. Two remaining
N–H bonds were excluded from the analysis, the first of which
is one of the primary amino N–H bonds because including both
primary N–H bonds was deemed unnecessary because of the fact
they are very similar in magnitude. The N–H bond distance corresponding
to the nitrogen atom, which is also bonded to the R group, was also
omitted from the analysis as it is not present in any of the training
or test set structures. The N–R bond was also excluded because
the large variety of R groups causes too substantial a variation in
the bond length. Using a total of 17 compounds from 10 different sources,
bond length versus pKa plot using the
C=N bond of tautomer A is found to return the
highest r2 value of 0.925
(see Table 6). The
removal of five outliers, that is, methylguanidine, acetylguanidine,
metformin, amiloride, and biguanide, reveals an r2 value of 0.97. These outliers are not wildly anomalous,
and their inclusion still allows for a correlation of >0.90. We
may
therefore only rationalize their removal from the training set by
the possibility of small deviations in experimental values, which
are inherent to the varied experimental techniques and the conditions
in which they were measured. The final set of 13 compounds used to
form the predictive model implemented in the next section are shown
in Table 7 and in the
Supporting Information Tables S11–S15, respectively, for tautomers A to E.

4.2.2 External
Test Set
The pKa prediction software
by ChemAxon is again implemented
to assess the quality of our predictions relative to a popular choice
of a predictor. Our chosen model, as discussed in the previous section,
is formed from tautomer A. For a fair comparison, the
same tautomer used for the AIBLHiCoS model is also used as input for
ChemAxon, in addition to the most stable form, C. As
the r2 value and other model validation
statistics for the bonds of tautomer C are inferior to
tautomer A, it can be confidently assumed that they would
give inferior predictions to our model using A and are
therefore not included.

The ChemAxon prediction error for the C tautomer is very respectable (0.54, Table 8), although the MAE does fall short of the
<0.5 units threshold by a small margin. AIBLHiCoS offers only a
minor advantage, with a slightly lower MAE (0.29) and 3 out of 12
errors in excess of 0.5 units. However, because of the large range
of our models used to predict for the guanidines (7.2), both of Roy’s
criteria are satisfied: (1) the MAE of 0.29 is smaller than 10% of
the training set range or 0.71 and (2) MAE + (3 × σ) =
1.23 is smaller than 20% of the training set range, which is 1.42.
ChemAxon shows 5 out of 12 errors above the 0.5 threshold using the C tautomer, but this rises to 9 out of 12 when tautomer A is used as the input structure. Once again, the prediction
accuracy is highly dependent on user input with respect to the tautomeric
form.

a Predictions using
ChemAxon software
are also shown for both tautomer A and tautomer C. Compounds are shown in their most stable tautomer, C.

For the guanidine
test set, the only AIBLHiCoS prediction above
1 unit corresponds to PG3, that is, 1-(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)guanidine.
Our model gives an error of +1.05 units, whereas ChemAxon gives an
error of −0.89. Inspection of the optimized structure reveals
the presence of an IHB between an amino group on guanidine and the
nitrogen of the pyridine ring. As observed for the imidazolidines,
the presence of IHBs can cause significant deviations in certain bond
lengths, leading to further partitioning of the set into subsets of
higher structural commonality. Evidence for this effect lies in the
lower prediction errors observed for two 3-pyridinyls, PG1 and PG2 (+0.55 and −0.24), for which the pyridine’s
nitrogen is too far away for H-bonding to be feasible. There are pKa data available for 1-(2-pyridinyl)guanidine
and 1-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)guanidine, and when the bond lengths of
their optimized structures are included in the C=N versus pKa plot using tautomer A, they also
appear below the line of best fit, near to the data point for PG3, giving errors of +1.53 and +1.22, respectively. A new
HiCoS cannot be constructed using only two data points, and so a predictive
equation that better describes the LFER for these compounds will be
constructed when adequate data can be procured.

5 Conclusions
We have demonstrated the existence of novel,
highly correlated
linear relationships between gas-phase equilibrium bond lengths within
the guanidine fragment of 2-(phenylimino)imidazolidine derivatives
and their aqueous pKa values. It has been
established that the relationship between bond lengths and pKa is strengthened for the amino tautomers, T1
and T2, when conformational congruence is ensured. However, three
single-bond-length models with excellent validation statistics (r2 > 0.95) emerged for compounds in their
most
stable conformations of the imino tautomer, T3. For this tautomer,
shorter calculated a, b, and d bond lengths
and a longer C=N c bond length
than that observed for the unsubstituted species can be collectively
considered, indicative of a compound with higher acidity.

Predictions
made using the three a, b, and d CN single-bond-length
models were then compared to those obtained
via implementation of an MLR model built from all three bond lengths a, b, and d versus pKa.
The MLR model was found to exhibit superior validation statistics
over any single-bond-length model. Prediction errors using the MLR
model were found to be less than 0.5 for most compounds, but four
anomalously large errors were observed for four 2-pyridyl compounds.
These larger errors can be attributed to anomalously short b and d bonds, which
are explained in terms of the presence of an IHB between the N–H
of imidazolidine and the heteroatom of 2-pyridine. A robust protocol
is then established, whereby the single-bond-length model a should be used to predict for compounds with a
heteroatom at the 2-position, but the MLR model should be implemented
for all other classes of compounds shown in the training and test
sets. This protocol allowed for an MAE and standard deviation for
all 27 compounds of 0.20 and 0.18, respectively.

It must be
noted that the power of this relationship especially
revealed itself on a few occasions during this part of the work. First,
as mentioned in a recent study,25 the initial
experimental value for compound ph12 (8.13) meant that
our a model prediction gave an error
of 0.85 log units, which was puzzling when compared to the high accuracy
of the prediction for the fluoro analogue, ph14. However,
remeasurements revealed the initial value to be erroneous, and the
real value (7.29) fitted our initial prediction to within the 0.5
unit accuracy threshold. Furthermore, implementation of the T3 a model using an enhanced training set has
revealed that some of the 20 UV-metric values reported for diphenyl-based
bis(2-iminoimidazolidines) by Ríos Martínez
et al.39 are inaccurate, most dramatically
in the case of compound 6h, for which the prediction
errors were reduced from +0.88 and −2.56 to +0.37 and +0.33,
upon remeasurement using the pH-metric technique. The MAE for the
16 remeasured pH-metric values was found to be 0.27 with a standard
deviation of 0.10. The MAE, standard deviation of AE of both external
test sets, and training set ranges mean that both models may be considered
“good” in terms of their predictive ability according
to Roy’s criteria. The AIBLHiCoS method provides average prediction
errors that are superior to ChemAxon’s pKa predictor in all cases tested here. Further, the order of
microdissociation steps predicted by Marvin was incorrect in the case
of three compounds, whereas AIBLHiCoS is found to be correct in every
case.

Revisiting the previously established model for guanidine
derivatives
provides corroboration of our previous work at a new level of theory,
which suggests once again that, counterintuitively, it is not the
most stable gas-phase tautomer that provides the active bond(s). The
MAE for the test set of phenylguanidine analogues employed here was
0.29, which is both lower than that obtained by the ChemAxon program
and in accordance with Roy’s stringent MAE evaluation criteria
and is evidence of a “good” model.

We also present
our findings from the first IQA-based study in
the context of these LFERs, where in our efforts to rationalize outliers,
it was found that the VxcAB values for bonding interactions were
also found to correlate highly with pKa. Furthermore, the active equilibrium bond lengths (those which correlate
most highly with pKa) also correlate highly
to the extent of delocalization between the two bonded atoms. Further
work will explore the meaning of this interesting observation in the
context of our protocol.
