This
article illustrates the detailed decomposition behavior of
NH4HSO4 on the TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 supports, along with the effect of SiO2 addition on the sulfur resistance of the corresponding V2O5-based catalysts. For TiO2 support,
sulfate species selectively occupied its surface basic hydroxyl groups,
while Si–OH groups functioned as the main sites for the accommodation
of NH4HSO4 over the TiO2–SiO2 mixed support, enabling its surface sulfate species with
higher thermal stability. Compared with NH4+ on the TiO2 surface, NH4+ on the
TiO2–SiO2 mixed support was much easier
to be consumed during the heating process, hence causing some variations
in the decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4. Finally,
adding SiO2 enhanced the SO2 tolerance properties
of the catalysts to a certain extent. When exposed to the SO2-containing flue gas, the deposition of NH4HSO4 mainly caused serious deactivation of SiO2-free catalyst,
while the as-accumulated SO42– also contributed
to the declined activity of SiO2-added catalyst. These
results ensured the potential commercialization of TiO2–SiO2-based catalysts in the typical low-temperature
selective catalytic reduction systems in the short run and pointed
out a strategy to design new catalysts with superior activity and
enhanced SO2-tolerant ability.

1 Introduction
Selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3 is
the most widespread technology for the abatement of NOx in both mobile and stationary applications.1 For industrial heaters and furnaces, the flue
gas temperature is always below 300 °C, which makes commercial
SCR catalysts exhibit a disappointing activity. Therefore, low-temperature
SCR technology is gaining attention, and recently, several types of
catalysts have been reported to possess a satisfactory activity in
the temperature region of 100–300 °C.2 However, the formation of NH4HSO4 would inevitably take place when SO2 and H2O are simultaneously added to the reactant gas. The as-produced NH4HSO4 then covers the active sites of the catalysts
and negatively affects the SCR reactions, which is the main barrier
to the industrialization of low-temperature SCR systems.3 Thus, designing a catalyst with an enhanced sulfur-tolerant
ability becomes an important step in solving this problem.

The
decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4 has
been proved to partially determine the sulfur resistance of catalysts
in our previous studies.4 It has been confirmed
that the deposited NH4HSO4 selectively occupies
certain functional groups on the catalyst surfaces.5 Once the deposition amount of NH4HSO4 increases, a deficit in surface sites for the deposition of NH4HSO4 would result in the presence of crystalline
ammonium sulfate salts on the catalysts. Compared with amorphous ammonium
sulfate salts, crystalline salts have higher thermal stability. Thus,
an effective strategy to improve the catalyst sulfur resistance is
to enlarge its specific surface area and increase sites for amorphous
NH4HSO4 deposition, which could impede the formation
of crystalline ammonium sulfate salts on the catalysts to a certain
extent. As a result, an improved NH4HSO4 decomposition
behavior would be observed and catalyst sulfur resistance might be
in turn promoted.

TiO2–SiO2 mixed
oxide has been widely
utilized as an effective support for SCR catalysts due to its large
surface area.6 In terms of the detailed
mechanism of NH4HSO4 decomposition over the
TiO2–SiO2 mixed oxide, scanty information
was available. But some aspects of paramount importance must be taken
into consideration. (a) Provided that parts of SO42– are bonded to SiO2 sites, some changes
in the decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4 might
be caused on the SiO2-containing samples, since there exist
some variations in the physicochemical properties between TiO2 and SiO2. (b) Provided that SiO2 modification
leads to an enhancement in the decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4, it is important to clarify whether the enlarged
surface area is the main reason.

For the reasons mentioned above,
TiO2 support and TiO2–SiO2 mixed support, along with V2O5–WO3/TiO2 and V2O5–WO3/TiO2–SiO2 catalysts, were synthesized.
First, the decomposition behavior
of NH4HSO4 on these samples was investigated
to demonstrate that NH4HSO4 deposited on the
pure supports behaves similarly to that on the corresponding V2O5-based catalysts so that it is reasonable to
use the as-prepared supports instead of the catalysts to study the
detailed decomposition mechanism of NH4HSO4 for
simplification. And then, X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study the
existing forms of NH4HSO4 on the samples. Finally,
sulfur resistance tests were performed to explore the effect of SiO2 addition on the SO2-tolerant ability of the catalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Decomposition Behavior
of NH4HSO4 on the Serial Samples
According
to previous studies,
it has been proved that a vital step in the decomposition of NH4HSO4 would be the transformation of S-containing
species from SO42– to SO2 because
SO2, instead of SO3, is the unique S-containing
product in this reaction.7 Thus, temperature-programmed
decomposition (TPDC) method was adopted to study the stability of
SO42– on the serial samples, which would
be evaluated using the outlet SO2 signal.

In the
case of Ti support, the outlet SO2 concentration starts
to increase at ca. 200 °C, indicating the occurrence of the consumption
of SO42– (Figure 1). As the temperature exceeds 350 °C,
a fast upward trend of the outlet SO2 signal is presented,
of which the highest point (ca. 72 ppm) centers at ca. 445 °C.
For TiSi mixed support, the onset temperature of SO2 release
increases to ca. 350 °C; on further increasing the temperature,
the outlet signal of SO2 shows a trend of slow increase.
And it should be noted that during the whole reaction process, the
outlet concentration of SO2 belonging to TiSi mixed support
is much lower than that of Ti support. It seems that SO42– on the TiSi mixed support has higher thermal
stability, and the decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4 might be inhibited through adding SiO2.

Figure 1 SO2 profiles of the serial NH4HSO4-deposited samples.

Derivative thermogravimetry (DTG)
profiles of the serial NH4HSO4-introduced samples
are given in Figures 2 and S1. It seems that it is appropriate
to study the detailed decomposition
behavior of NH4HSO4 on the pure support surfaces
for simplification because of the unnoticeable change in the decomposition
behavior of NH4HSO4 after adding V2O5 and WO3. As the temperature increases, two
weight loss peaks are seen for the ABS–Ti sample (centered
at 363 and 453 °C), while the ABS–TiSi sample exhibits
three weight loss peaks (at 149, 283, and 523 °C). The appearance
of the weight loss peaks below 300 °C confirms that adding SiO2 has a promotional effect on the decomposition behavior of
NH4HSO4 at low-temperature regions, which is
in contrast to the assumptions mentioned above. It seems that doping
SiO2 might result in some changes in the reaction routes
of NH4HSO4 decomposition. Combined with the
SO2 profiles in Figure 1, it seems that the consumption behavior of SO42– can in part explain the presence of the
weight loss peaks above 450 °C, while the weight loss peaks belonging
to the ABS–TiSi sample below 300 °C may be related to
the NH4+ decomposition behavior, which would
be evidenced using the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier
transforms (DRIFTS) experiments.

Figure 2 DTG profiles of the serial NH4HSO4-deposited
samples.

The detailed decomposition behavior
of NH4HSO4 on the serial supports was investigated
using the in situ DRIFTS
method. As shown in Figure 3, characteristic peaks related to NH4+ at ca. 1432 cm–1, bidentate SO42– at ca. 1250 cm–1, and H2O at 1632 cm–1 are present at 100 °C.4a,8 With the increasing temperature, a blue shift of the bands occurs,
which is assigned to SO42–, and the peak
intensity for NH4+ continuously decreases. After
calculating these samples’ relative concentrations of NH4+ and SO42–, it could
be found that the consumption of NH4+ occurs
prior to that of SO42– during the heating
process and NH4+ on the TiSi support exhibits
lower thermal stability. Combined with the FTIR spectra in Figure S2, it could be concluded that the appearance
of the weight loss peaks below 300 °C can be mainly explained
by the decomposition of NH4+ for ABS–TiSi
sample, and the simultaneous consumption of NH4+ and SO42– constitutes the weight loss
peak centering at ca. 360 °C for NH4HSO4 deposited on the Ti support; the weight loss peaks above 450 °C
are largely ascribed to the consumption of SO42–.

Figure 3 In situ DRIFTS experiments of NH4HSO4 on
the (a) Ti support and (b) TiSi support, and (c) relative concentrations
of NH4+ and SO42– of the serial samples.

As mentioned above, during the heating process, NH4+ bonding to sulfate species would be consumed at low-temperature
regions, leaving sulfate species stabilized on the catalyst supports.
On further increasing the temperature, the stabilized SO42– begins to decompose. Compared with Ti support,
NH4+ on the TiSi sample is much easier to be
consumed, on which SO42–, however, is
hard to decompose. The reasons for this are still unknown but would
be revealed in the next sections through investigating the interactions
between NH4HSO4 and these catalyst supports.

2.2 Interactions between NH4HSO4 and Catalyst Supports
2.2.1 Texture Properties of
the Serial Samples
The XRD patterns of the serial samples
are presented in Figure 4a. The diffraction
peaks belonging to Ti and TiSi samples exhibit typical anatase TiO2 phase (PDF-ICDD 21-1272). It should be noted that the peak
intensity of TiSi mixed support is much weaker than that of Ti support,
suggesting that introducing SiO2 exerts an inhibitory effect
on the formation of TiO2 crystal phase.9 Given the deposition of NH4HSO4,
no diffraction peaks indexed to any crystalline ammonium sulfate salts
are generated, indicating that NH4HSO4 on the
support surfaces is amorphous in structure.

Figure 4 (a) XRD patterns and
(b) Raman spectra of the serial samples.

In addition to XRD patterns, Raman spectra could be used
to further
study the physical properties of the serial samples (Figure 4b). For Ti support, five Raman
peaks centering at 145, 198, 396, 516, and 639 cm–1 are seen, which could be assigned to anatase TiO2 phase.10 Given that SiO2 is introduced, the
peaks for anatase TiO2 phase shift to higher wavenumbers,
demonstrating that the TiO bond order increases and the bond distance
between Ti and O atoms becomes longer.2a That is to say, doping SiO2 causes lattice distortion
of TiO2 because of the different radii between Ti and Si
atoms (Ti: 0.2 nm; Si: 0.117 nm), which might in turn produce new
sites for the accommodation of NH4HSO4. Additionally,
the intensity of the peaks attributed to anatase TiO2 phase
decreases for TiSi mixed support, which is consistent with the XRD
patterns in Figure 4a that the crystal growth of TiO2 is hindered to some
extent upon the addition of SiO2. After the deposition
of NH4HSO4, little change has taken place in
the serial Raman peaks, demonstrating that catalyst support crystal
phases remain unchanged with the introduction of NH4HSO4.

Table 1 demonstrates
the data of surface areas and pore volumes of the studied samples.
Compared with Ti support, adding SiO2 significantly increases
the catalyst support surface area from 62 to 152 m2 g–1. To eliminate the possibility that an enlarged surface
area mainly explains the enhanced decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4 on the TiSi sample, TiO2 support
with a high surface area of ca. 250 m2 g–1 was synthesized (Table 1), and the thermogravimetry (TG)–DTG results are shown
in Figure S3. It can be confirmed that
catalyst chemical properties, rather than its textural structures,
mainly determine the stability of the deposited amorphous NH4HSO4.

2.2.2 Surface Species of the
Serial Samples
FTIR analysis was used to study the nature
of N and S species on
the supports. In the wavenumber range of 2000–1000 cm–1, no obvious characteristic IR peaks can be detected except the peak
ascribed to adsorbed H2O at 1624 cm–1 for Ti sample (Figure 5).11 By contrast, some peaks indexed to
residual sulfate species can still be detected for TiSi mixed support.12 This result in part indicates that SO42– is strongly bonded to TiSi support surface and
cannot be completely removed through the washing process, which is
consistent with the TPDC profiles in Figure 1 to some extent. Given that NH4HSO4 is deposited on the TiO2 support, characteristic
peaks for bidentate sulfate anions centering at 1219, 1134, and 1039
cm–1, along with the NH4+ band
at 1400 cm–1, are seen.12,13 The appearance of the peaks at 1219 and 1134 cm–1 is mainly explained by the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations
of S=O species, whereas the asymmetric stretching of the S–O
vibrations constitutes the IR peak at 1039 cm–1.14 As for the ABS–TiSi sample, the bands
related to bidentate SO42– begin to shift
toward higher and lower wavenumbers. It seems that certain Si-related
sites instead of Ti-related ones might act as a reservoir for the
accommodation of sulfate species for Si-doped sample, which would
be uncovered by the characteristics of catalyst surface hydroxyl groups.
As given in Figure 5b, a negative peak centering at 3698 cm–1 is observed
with the deposition of NH4HSO4 for TiO2 sample, suggesting that TiO2 surface basic hydroxyl groups
are the main sites for the selective occupation of SO42–.15 In the case of Si-decorated
sample, a negative peak attributed to Si–OH species appears
at 3692 cm–1 after introducing NH4HSO4, indicating that Si–OH groups, rather than TiO2 surface basic hydroxyl groups, might act as the main sites
for the accommodation of SO42–.16 These findings would be further evidenced by
the XPS method, through which the detailed element information of
the serial samples would be revealed.

Figure 5 (a) FTIR spectra of the serial samples
and (b) characteristics
of hydroxyl groups of the serial samples after the deposition of NH4HSO4.

2.2.3 Element Information of the Serial Samples
Surface element information of the serial samples was investigated
using the XPS method. As is illustrated in Figure 6a, the binding energies of the Ti 2p photoelectron
peaks are proved to be the characteristics of Ti4+ ions
as in TiO2.17 Given that NH4HSO4 is deposited on the Ti support surface, the
binding energies of the Ti 2p peaks increase, indicating that electrons
around the Ti atoms are attracted by SO42– because of this species’ stronger electronegativity. To some
extent, this result is consistent with the conclusions drawn from
the FTIR spectra in Figure 5 that Ti–OH species are the unique sites for the accommodation
of NH4HSO4 on the Ti surface, while for TiSi
support, the shift of the Ti 2p photoelectron peaks is negligible,
demonstrating that Ti atom environment remains almost unchanged regardless
of the deposition of NH4HSO4, and Ti–OH
sites might be free from the occupation of sulfate species.

Figure 6 XPS images:
(a) Ti 2p, (b) Si 2p, (c) N 1s, and (d) S 2p.

The XPS results of Si atoms are presented in Figure 6b. At ca. 102 eV, one Si 2p
photoelectron
peak is seen, revealing that Si atoms in the SiO2-containing
samples exist in the +4 oxidation state.18 In the meantime, adding NH4HSO4 increases
the binding energies of the Si 2p peaks from 101.90 to 102.20 eV,
illustrating that NH4HSO4 sometimes interacts
with SiO2 and that Si–OH groups might function as
the main sites for the occupation of sulfate species. Combined with
the FTIR spectra in Figure 5, it could be concluded that different occupation sites of
sulfate species mainly explain the occurrence of the variations in
the decomposition behavior of NH4HSO4 on the
TiSi mixed support. And considering the existence of chemical interactions
between NH4HSO4 and catalyst supports, it seems
that some changes might take place in N and S atom environments after
the doping of SiO2.

According to Figure 6c, N species in the ABS–Ti
sample exhibit in the form of NH4+, while in
the ABS–TiSi sample, some subpeaks
are obtained after deconvolution. One peak centering at ca. 401.70
eV is speculated to be the characteristic of NH4+, which is the same with that of the ABS–Ti sample.19 The other peak at ca. 400 eV reveals the existence
of adsorbed NH3.20 This result
indicates that NH4+ on the TiSi mixed support
surface might have lower thermal stability; a vacuum environment could
promote the consumption behavior of the bonded NH4+ and then the as-released NH3 would in turn adsorb
on the TiSi support, which might be the main reason for the appearance
of the subpeak at ca. 400 eV and is consistent with the FTIR spectra
in Figure 3 that doping
SiO2 causes a larger decline scope of the relative concentration
value of NH4+ during the heating process.

As shown in Figure 6d, two evident bands corresponding to the S 2p1/2 and
S 2p3/2 spin–orbit states of sulfate species are
obtained after deconvolution.21 Given the
modification of SiO2, an increase in the binding energies
of the S 2p bands could be detected, which is indicative of the lower
electron cloud density around the S atoms on the TiSi mixed support
than that on the Ti support. This would exert an inhibitory effect
on the transformation of S species from SO42– to SO2 to a certain extent.22 As a result, the release amount of SO2 decreases during
heating, and the weight loss peaks mainly attributed to the consumption
of SO42– shift toward higher temperatures
via adding SiO2.

As previously mentioned, once NH4HSO4 is
deposited on the catalyst supports, their surface hydroxyl groups
would be selectively occupied by sulfate species (Figure 7). During the heating process,
NH4+ decomposes first, as the consumption of
SO42– follows. Compared with TiO2 sample, SO42– on the TiSi support
surface tends to be strongly bonded to Si–OH sites, which would
in turn weaken the interactions between sulfate species and NH4+. Consequently, NH4+ on
the SiO2-modified sample is easy to be consumed, whereas
its surface SO42– exhibits higher stability.

decomposition routes of NH4HSO4 on
the serial supports.

2.3 Sulfur-Tolerant Ability of the Serial Catalysts
Based on the TG–DTG profiles in Figures 2 and S1, the decomposition
behavior of NH4HSO4 is enhanced to some extent
through adding SiO2. Considering the deactivation mechanism
of V2O5/TiO2-based SCR catalysts
during the operation in the SO2- and H2O-containing
flue gas below 300 °C, it seems that catalyst SO2-tolerant
ability might be improved after the doping of SiO2.

The time dependency of the relative activity during proceeding SO2 and H2O reaction is depicted in Figure 8. In terms of VW/Ti catalyst,
the relative activity falls below ca. 0.85 after 12 h. As for VW/TiSi
catalyst, this value remains above ca. 0.94 in the whole deactivation
period, suggesting that SiO2-promoted catalyst has an enhanced
SO2-resistant ability in the lower-temperature region.
The N and S contents of the serial catalysts after the sulfur deactivation
period are presented in Table 2. For VW/Ti catalyst, the ratio of N/S content is ca. 0.46,
which is almost equal to that of NH4HSO4 (ca.
0.44). It seems that the deposition of NH4HSO4 might mainly explain the deactivation of SiO2-free catalyst
by SO2 and H2O. By contrast, this ratio drops
to ca. 0.23 for VW/TiSi catalyst, further confirming that ammonia
species on the SiO2-containing sample possesses lower thermal
stability. Therefore, apart from NH4HSO4, the
accumulation of sulfate species also contributes to the declined activity
of VW/TiSi catalyst when exposed to the SO2- and H2O-containing flue gas.

catalysts. Conditions: 667

2.4 Evaluation of the Activity of the Serial Samples
As shown in Figure 9a, these two fresh catalysts exhibit over 90% NOx conversion between 300 and 450 °C, and little change
has occurred in the SCR activity with the addition of SiO2. After the deposition of NH4HSO4, a dramatic
decrease in the catalytic activity could be observed. Compared with
VW/Ti catalyst, the deactivation of VW/TiSi sample by the deposition
of NH4HSO4 is inhibited to a certain extent,
which constitutes an important reason for the promoted SO2-tolerant ability of SiO2-decorated catalyst. Apart from
NH4HSO4, the accumulated SO42– also explains the decreased NOx conversion of the catalysts in the SO2 deactivation
process. Therefore, it is essential to study the effect of SO42– addition on the performance of the serial
samples. Similar to the phenomena in Figure 9a, adding SO42– also negatively affects the activity of the serial samples in the
whole temperature range, and SiO2-doped catalyst still
exhibits higher activity compared to SiO2-free catalyst
(Figure 9b). The N
and S contents of the serial samples in Table 3 eliminate the possibility that lower deposition
amount of NH4HSO4 and SO42– is the main reason for the improved activity of SiO2-containing
catalyst.

SO42–-added catalysts. Conditions: 667
ppm NO + 667 ppm NH3 + 5% O2 + N2 as balanced gas, GHSV = 150 000 mL g–1 h–1.

Table 3 Elemental
Analysis of the Serial Samples

ABS–VW/Ti	1.17	2.54	
ABS–VW/TiSi	1.04	2.56	
VW/Ti–SO42–	 	2.81	
VW/TiSi–SO42–	 	2.77	
As mentioned above, NH4HSO4 would be inevitably
produced under the condition that SO2 and H2O are simultaneously added to the reactant gas, which blocks the
catalyst pore structures and adversely affects the SCR reactions.
That is to say, sulfur resistance of the catalysts is closely related
to the performance of their NH4HSO4-deposited
counterparts. Compared with SiO2-free catalysts, the introduction
of SiO2 obviously improves the activity of the NH4HSO4-deposited samples, which partially contributes to
the enhancement in the sulfur resistance of SiO2-modified
catalyst. It should be noted that once NH4HSO4 is deposited on the catalyst surfaces, NH4+ tends to decompose with SO42– strongly
bonded to −OH sites. In other words, the remaining SO42– would also cause decrease in the catalyst activity.
And to some extent, the activity of the SO42–-accumulated catalysts also determines the sulfur resistance of their
fresh counterparts. Similar to the phenomena of NH4HSO4-deposited ones, the deactivation of the catalysts by SO42– is also impeded via the introduction
of SiO2, which further explains the promoted SO2-resistant ability of VW/TiSi catalyst. For these reasons, it seems
that TiSi-based SCR catalysts might be commercialized in the short
run, and this finding would pave the way for the design of new catalyst
systems with superior activity and enhanced SO2-tolerant
ability.

3 Conclusions
This
article illustrates the detailed decomposition behavior of
NH4HSO4 on the Ti and TiSi supports, along with
the corresponding V2O5-based catalysts’
low-temperature sulfur-tolerant ability. The conclusions are listed
below:(1) In the
case of Ti support, sulfate
species selectively occupies its surface basic hydroxyl groups, while
for TiSi mixed support, Si–OH groups function as the main sites
for the accommodation of NH4HSO4, which enables
its surface SO42– with higher thermal
stability.

(2) During the
heating process, the consumption
of NH4+ occurs prior to that of SO42–; NH4+ on the TiSi mixed
support possesses lower thermal stability than that on the Ti support.

(3) SO2 tolerance
properties
of the catalysts are enhanced to a certain extent after the addition
of SiO2. In the SO2-purging period, the declined
activity of SiO2-containing catalyst is largely ascribed
to the accumulation of SO42– and NH4HSO4, while more serious deactivation of SiO2-free catalyst is mainly due to the deposition of NH4HSO4.



4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of the Samples
TiO2–SiO2 mixed support (denoted as TiSi) was
prepared using the coprecipitation method. Certain amounts of Ti(SO4)2 and tetraethyl orthosilicate were dissolved
in dilute sulfuric acid solution and ethanol, respectively. The two
obtained solutions were mixed together and slowly added to the excess
ammonia solution. After that, the precipitate was obtained through
filtration and washed with deionized water several times until no
residual SO42– was detected (using Ba(NO3)2 solution). Finally, the obtained powder was
dried at 105 °C overnight and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h.
The molar ratio of Ti/Si was 4:1. The single metal oxide, TiO2 (Ti for short), was prepared using the similar precipitation
method.

In addition, TiO2 support (labeled as Ti(NW))
with high surface area was prepared using the hydrothermal method.23 Briefly, 2.5 g of P25 TiO2 powder
(85%: anatase, 15%: rutile; SBET = ca. 55 m2 g–1) obtained from Degussa was immersed into 70
mL of 10 mol L–1 KOH solution. Then, the mixture
was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 130 °C
for 24 h. After cooling down, the obtained white powder was washed
with 1 L of 0.1 mol L–1 HCl solution three times
and then with deionized water several times to remove the residual
K+ and Cl–. Finally, the powder was dried
at 105 °C overnight and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h.

V2O5–WO3/TiO2 (VW/Ti)
and V2O5–WO3/TiO2–SiO2 (VW/TiSi) catalysts, whose contents
of V2O5 and WO3 were 3 and 5 wt %,
respectively, were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation
method. Calculated amounts of NH4VO3 and H40N10O41W12·xH2O were dissolved in 1 mL of 0.1 mol L–1 oxalic solution, which was mixed with Ti or TiSi support. Afterward,
the mixtures were stirred for 1 h and exposed to ultrasonic energy
for another 2 h at 50 °C, during which process excess water was
removed. All of the prepared samples were dried at 105 °C overnight
and finally calcined at 500 °C for 5 h.

The deposition
of NH4HSO4 was carried out
using the solution impregnation method. The as-prepared powders were
immersed in NH4HSO4 solution. Then, the mixtures
were exposed to ultrasonic energy for ca. 2 h and dried at 105 °C
overnight. The samples were designated ABS–Ti, ABS–TiSi,
ABS–VW/Ti, and ABS–VW/TiSi.

The introduction of
SO42– was conducted
using the similar impregnation method except that NH4HSO4 solution was replaced by dilute sulfuric acid solution. The
samples were labeled as VW/Ti–SO42– and VW/TiSi–SO42–.

4.2 Reaction Systems
In a typical temperature-programmed
decomposition (TPDC) process, a NH4HSO4-loaded
sample of 0.3 g was pretreated at 100 °C for 1 h in flowing N2 to remove the adsorbed impurities. And then, the sample was
cooled down to room temperature and heated to 450 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 in N2. The flow
rate was 500 mL min–1. A flue gas analyzer (Testo
350) was used to record the outlet signal of SO2, which
could reflect the stability of SO42– on
the serial samples.

Activity tests of the serial catalysts were
carried out in the reaction system. The feeding gases contained 667
ppm NO, 667 ppm NH3, and 5% O2 and N2 as the carrier gas. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 150 000
mL g–1 h–1. The concentrations
of NO and NO2 for the gases before and after passing through
the catalyst bed were analyzed using a flue gas analyzer (Testo 350).
The NOx conversion was calculated using
the following equation 1  Sulfur tolerance tests of the serial catalysts
were performed in the reaction system at 250 °C. The reaction
condition was similar to that mentioned above except that 250 ppm
SO2 and 5% H2O were also purged into the reaction
system. Catalyst deactivation status after exposure to the H2O- and SO2-containing flue gas was reflected by the relative
activity value of X/X0, in which X is the NOx conversion at certain time in the SO2 deactivation process
and X0 is the NOx conversion of fresh catalysts.

4.3 Characterizations
of the Samples
Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on
the serial NH4HSO4-deposited samples using TA
Instruments SDT Q500.
Prior to each experiment, a sample of 6 mg was pretreated in N2 at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the adsorbed H2O. After that, the tested sample was cooled down to 50 °C and
heated to 650 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in N2.

XRD measurements of the serial samples were
conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU D/MAX 2550, Japan). Patterns
in the range between 10 and 80° were recorded with a step size
of 0.02° (2θ). S and N elemental analysis experiments were
performed using an elemental analyzer (Vario Micro).

The textural
structures of the serial samples were measured by
N2 adsorption on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument.
The specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. The pore size distributions were calculated from the
N2 desorption isotherms using the cylindrical pore model
(Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model).

The nature of
bonding of sulfate and ammonia species with catalyst
surface was studied using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet 6700).
The IR absorbance spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400
cm–1. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw
inVia spectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser (514.4 nm line).

XPS experiments were performed on a PANalytical X’prt Pro
diffractometer. The binding energies of the Ti 2p, Si 2p, N 1s, and
S 2p photoelectron peaks were calibrated with C 1s peak (BE = 284.5
eV) as standard.

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier
transform (DRIFT)
spectra were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer.
First, the NH4HSO4-free sample loaded in the
Harrick IR cell was pretreated at 300 °C under a flowing N2 atmosphere for 1 h to remove the adsorbed impurities. The
background spectra at 250, 200, 150, and 100 °C were collected
in N2. After cooling down to room temperature, the NH4HSO4-free sample was replaced by the NH4HSO4-deposited one, which was flushed by N2 at room temperature for 1 h to remove the physically adsorbed impurities.
Finally, the IR spectra were collected at the serial temperatures
(100, 150, 200, and 250 °C) in N2 at a resolution
of 4 cm–1 typically averaging 64 scans.4b,4c,5 The relative concentrations of
NH4+ and SO42– were
calculated using the method proposed by our group in the previous
studies.4c,24 Based on the obtained IR spectra, the areas
of the NH4+ and SO42– peaks at the serial temperatures were calculated. And then, the
peak area for NH4+ at different temperatures
was divided by that at 100 °C. The obtained values could be labeled
as the relative concentrations of NH4+. The
relative concentrations of SO42– were
calculated using the same method.
