A novel mesoporous carbon nanostructured
material was prepared
and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and X-ray diffractometry.
The material demonstrated high-speed and high-adsorption capacities
of 827.5 and 2484.5 mg g–1 for methyl orange (MO)
and malachite green (MG) dyes in 10 min. The kinetic data were fitted
to pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order, external and intraparticle
diffusion, and Elovich models, whereas the isotherm data were adjusted
to the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin–Radushkevich,
and Langmuir–Freundlich isotherms (Sips). It was found that
MO and MG adsorption was limited by chemical interactions and mixed
diffusion. Besides, the physical process was elucidated through free
energy values (E = 2.56 and 0.049 kJ mol–1 for the MO and MG, respectively). Methyl orange adsorption mostly
occurred through ion exchange and electrostatic interactions, and
at lower MO concentrations, through chemical interactions and surface
complexation as well. Malachite green adsorption took place only on
lower-energy sites. Thus, it can be concluded that the adsorbent proposed
herein possessed high-speed and high-adsorption capacity. Therefore,
it can be considered as promising in removing the reported dye pollutants.

1 Introduction
Safe drinking water is vital to all known forms of life.1 It is estimated that the world population will
increase up to 8 billion by the end of 2020,2 and over 1.1 billion people will lack clean and pure drinking water
supply due to the rising cost of potable water and other environmental
concerns. More than half of the world population will be facing water-based
vulnerability by the year 2025.3 Amongst
various contaminants,4−6 the dyes are considered to be the serious pollutants
due to their toxicity and prevention of plankton and fish growth by
checking the penetration of light in the water resources, thus inhibiting
photosynthesis.7,8 Therefore, dye contamination is
considered as a serious issue, and the competent authorities are concerned
to control this contamination and eager to evolve the removal methods.9 Methyl orange (MO) and malachite green (MG) are
toxic and, sometimes, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and genotoxic. Besides,
malachite green is also toxic to mitochondria and nucleic acids. Therefore,
the need for the removal of these toxic dyes is urgent from the health
point of view. Adsorption is considered as the best method for water
treatment due to its ease of operation and universal nature.10 Many adsorbents starting from conventional to
nanomaterials have been tested in adsorption for the removal of many
pollutants.11 Due to the passing of time
and advancement of research, more effective adsorbents are required
for fast and effective removal of the pollutants.12−17 Nanotechnology is gaining importance in the area of nanoadsorbents.18−24 In this series, the attempts were made to synthesize and characterize
a new carbon nanomaterial, mesoporous carbon (MPC). The prepared MPC
was used for the removal of the above said toxic dyes. Besides, the
efforts are also made to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of
the removal of methyl orange and malachite green dyes. It was also
planned to conduct a comprehensive analytical diagnosis of the physical–chemical
properties of the material synthesized to establish the activity of
various adsorption sites on its surface, as well as the effect on
the removal and immobilization of MO and MG dyes from aqueous solutions.
The results are presented in this article.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Material Synthesis
To synthesize
the mesoporous carbon (MPC) material, the aqueous solutions of dextrin
and a Fenotam-GR-326 phenol-formaldehyde resin (Krata Ltd., Tambov,
Russia) were mixed with Taunit-M carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (NanoTech
Center Ltd, Tambov, Russia). The mixture was heat-treated at 300 °C,
mixed with potassium hydroxide, and chemically activated at 750 °C.
The resulting material was washed with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric
acid and distilled water, and then dried at 110 °C.

2.2 Material Characterization
The morphological
and structural characteristics of the adsorbent were examined by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) under a MERLIN microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2010
instrument (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The specific surface area and
porosity were measured based on nitrogen adsorption using an Autosorb-iQ
analyzer (Quantachrome). To determine the qualitative and quantitative
phase composition of the materials, a Difrey 401 desktop X-ray diffractometer
(Scientific Instruments CJSC, St. Petersburg, Russia) was used. The
absorbance of the prepared solutions was determined on a PE-5400 V
spectrophotometer (Ekros-Engineering LLC, Saint Petersburg, Russia).
Raman spectra were recorded on a DXR Raman microscope (Thermo Scientific
Instruments Group, Waltham, MA). The mass losses and thermal effects
were determined by an STA 449 F3 Jupiter instrument (NETZSCH-Feinmahltechnik
GmbH, Selb, Germany), which allowed simultaneous thermogravimetry
(TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements too.

2.3 Adsorbent Dosage Effect on the Adsorption
Capacity
To determine the effect of the adsorbent dosage,
30 mL of 1500 mg L–1 methyl orange (MO) and malachite
green (MG) solutions (reagent grade, Laverna Story Engineering Ltd.,
Moscow, Russia) at pH 3.0 were used. The adsorbent dosages were 0.03,
0.05, 0.075, and 0.1 g/30 mL for MO, and 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.03,
and 0.05 g/30 mL for MG. The mixtures were equilibrated by end-over-end
shaking for 10 min at 100 rpm and room temperature on a Multi Bio
RS-24 programmable rotator (Biosan, Riga, Latvia) and then filtered.

2.4 Isoionic Point Determination
To study
H+ and OH– adsorption on the MPC material,
30 mL of HCl and NaOH solutions of different concentrations and pH
were prepared. The “before-adsorption” pH of these solutions
was measured with a HI 2210 pH meter (Hanna Instruments, Vohringen,
Germany). After that, 0.03 g of the adsorbent was added, and the mixtures
were end-over-end shaken on a Multi Bio RS-24 rotator (Biosan) for
60 min, filtered, and then the “after-adsorption” pH
was measured.

2.5 Kinetic Study
To determine the kinetic
parameters for MO and MG adsorption, the experiments were carried
out with 0.03 g MPC for MO and 0.005 g MPC for MG with 30 mL of 1500
mg L–1 solutions of each dye. The dye concentrations
were determined after 5, 7, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. of adsorption.
The mixtures were end-over-end shaken for 5, 7, 10, 15, 30, 45, and
60 min at 100 rpm and room temperature on a Multi Bio RS-24 rotator
(Biosan) and then filtered.

2.6 Isotherm Study
The adsorption experiments
were carried out with 0.03 g MPC for MO and 0.005 g MPC for MG with
30 mL of 150–1500 mg L–1 of MO and MG solutions
(three replicates). The samples were equilibrated by end-over-end
shaking for 10 min at 100 rpm and room temperature on a Multi Bio
RS-24 programmable rotator (Biosan). In all of the above-mentioned
experiments, the dye amounts in the liquid phase before and after
the adsorption procedure were determined spectrophotometrically at
wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm for the MO and MG, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Material Characterization
The SEM
images of the MPC surface structure are presented in Figure 1a,b. In these images, it is
clear that the MPC material is in the form of CNTs and graphene. Also,
it is clear that their fragments are covered with a fairly uniform
layer of a porous carbon shell. It can be assumed that such destruction
and fragmentation of the CNTs are due to the features of the MPC synthesis
technology, high-temperature chemical activation.

Figure 1 SEM images of the MPC
structure; magnification: 100.00× (a),
and 300.00× (b).

In the TEM images (Figure 2a–d), fragments
of the CNTs can be seen. Since Taunit-M
CNTs were introduced into the initial composition to obtain the MPC
material, these retain their structural integrity after high-temperature
activation using KOH. It should be noted that this activation technique
was also studied by Raymundo-Piñero et al.,25 wherein it was found that CNTs possessed well-ordered structures
of graphene sheets and retained their structural integrity after activation.
The CNTs having poorly ordered structures, under KOH activation conditions,
underwent substantial structural destruction. Since Taunit-M CNTs
are characterized by a fairly well-ordered structure, this fact explained
their presence in the TEM images of the activated material. At the
same time, at many locations of the given images, short fragments
of the graphene sheets (not attributable to CNTs) can be observed.

Figure 2 TEM images:
(a, b) CNT structure in the MPC material; (c, d) graphene
layer structure.

By considering these
findings, the following things can be assumed.
It is known that metallic potassium forms a stable intercalation compound
with graphite. As a result of the KOH activation of the carbon material,
a novel material, which is sparked in air and generated hydrogen with
hissing when in contact with water, was formed, thereby evidencing
the availability of an unidentifiable metallic potassium/carbon compound.
It can be supposed that the metallic potassium atoms promoted the
formation of small fragments of local graphene structures around themselves,
which could be observed in the above images. This assumption can also
be confirmed by the data described by Xue et al.,26 which demonstrated that when unordered carbon was activated
with KOH, peaks corresponding to potassium–graphite intercalation
compounds could be seen in the diffraction pattern of the reaction
mixture. The graphene fragments probably acted as walls in porous
carbon materials formed through the KOH activation, otherwise, it
is difficult to explain such a high specific surface area of these
materials (usually, about 3000 m2 g–1). Besides, the good electrical conductivity of 5–10 S cm–1 is the other feature of KOH-activated highly porous
carbon materials. The electrical conductivity of common activated
carbons (AC) obtained through steam or carbon dioxide activation is
much worse. Thus, our data indicated that when carbon materials were
activated with KOH, the fragments of graphene structures were formed.

The elemental composition of MPC comprises carbon (90.17 wt % &
96.28 atom %), oxygen (2.90 wt % & 2.33 atom %), and copper (6.92
wt % & 1.40 atom %). The analysis of the elemental composition
shows that oxygen in small amounts is the main impurity in the MPC
material (apart from carbon being the primary element, copper is a
substrate material of a microscope stage). Since the activation is
carried out in a reducing medium containing the metallic potassium,
it could be assumed that the oxygen impurity is due to the chemisorption
of atmospheric oxygen on the surface of the resulting material.

The type of adsorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop (Figure 3) characterizes the
process of capillary condensation in the mesopores. The convex and
concave shape of the initial section indicates strong and weak adsorbate–adsorbent
interactions, respectively.27 The surface
and porosity characteristics of the MPC material synthesized are given
in Table 1.

Figure 3 N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for the MPC materials.

As seen
in this table, the specific surface area of the material
evaluated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method was 3438 m2 g–1, whereas the specific
surface area estimated based on the density functional theory (DFT)
was 2944 m2 g–1 (for the slit/cylindrical
pore calculation model, which provided the best fit to the experimentally
constructed adsorption isotherm).

The TG curve (Figure 4) shows that the adsorbent
destruction took place at 500 °C,
with an exothermic peak at 505 °C. This can be attributed to
the combustion of the material in air.

Figure 4 TG and DSC curves constructed
for the MPC material (in air).

The graphene layers consist of the carbon atoms, each of which
is in the sp2 hybridization state, bound by strong covalent
bonds to three neighboring atoms, resulting in the location of the
atoms at the vertices of regular hexagons. The formation of carcass
carbon nanostructures from the graphene layer fragments is a consequence
of the addition of topological defects to these layers, i.e., layer
rearrangement, so that tetragons, pentagons, heptagons, or octagons
appear in the layer structure apart from hexagons. The presence of
the topological defects in the graphene layers was proved experimentally.
Such defects can appear at the stage of growth or purification of
the nanomaterial; for instance, as a result of ion bombardment.28,29

As is known, highly ordered graphene materials have one band
in
the region of 1100 and 1700 cm–1 and the other one
in the region of 2400 and 3300 cm–1. One can judge
the defectiveness of the graphene structure by the ratio of G (graphitized
carbon) and D (disordered carbon) bands.30 In this regard, two pronounced peaks typical of carbon compounds,
the D (∼1330 cm–1) and G (∼1580 cm–1) bands, can be identified in the spectra recorded
for the MPC material (Figure 5). Since these bands are wide and their intensity is almost
the same, the material is supposed to have a low degree of graphitization
and a large number of topological defects in its crystal structure.

spectra recorded for the MPC material.

A broad peak near 2θ = 41.5° can be assigned to the
interlayer distance in the CNTs (Figure 6).

material.

3.2 Adsorbent
Dosage Effect on the Dye Adsorption
The adsorption amount
is an important parameter as it allows estimation
of the maximum adsorption capacity for a given initial adsorbate concentration.31 The adsorption capacity (Qe, mg g–1) of the material was determined
according to eq 1 1  where C0 is the
initial adsorbate concentration (mg L–1), C is the equilibrium adsorbate concentration in the bulk
(mg L–1), V is the liquid phase
volume (mL), and m is the adsorbent weight (dosage)
in gram. Figure 7 shows
the dependencies of the adsorption capacity of the MPC material on
its dosage.

Figure 7 Adsorbent dosage effect on the MO (a) and MG (b) adsorption on
the MCP material (experimental conditions: initial dye concentration:
1500 mg L–1, temperature: 294 K, and contact time:
10 min).

As seen in this figure, the adsorption
capacity of the material
decreased with increasing adsorbent weight. High material loading
might presumably be affected by the physical characteristics of the
solid–liquid suspension, e.g., by increasing the solution viscosity.
Thus, the adsorbent dosages of 0.03 and 0.005 g were chosen to study
the MO and MG adsorption, respectively.

3.3 Isoionic
Point
Adsorption from solutions
at the solid surface/electrolyte solution interface also depends on
the boundary electrical characteristics of the surface. These characteristics
can be estimated by studying changes in the magnitude and sign of
the surface charge with altering pH. The isoionic point or point of
zero charge (pHPZC), can be defined as the pH value of
the medium at which the concentrations of positive and negative ions
are the same (zero charge). To reach this point, it is necessary to
compensate for the increase in the degree of dissociation of acid
groups, which occurs when cations are adsorbed, i.e., to acidify the
solution. During the adsorption of anions, the isoionic point accordingly
shifts toward the alkaline region. The efficiency of the adsorption
of various pollutants on carbon materials depends on the isoionic
point value of the adsorbent. If the solution pH is higher than the
adsorbent pHPZC, the adsorption capacity depends on the
difference between these values.32,33

The
results of the experiments (Figure 8) demonstrated that MPC has a negative surface charge
at pH < 5 (pHPZC = 5), which significantly affects the
adsorption of the cationic dye molecules through electrostatic attraction.
The hydrogen index (pH) is a consequence of the quantitative content
of H+ and OH– ions, the excess of H+ decreased the pH value, whereas the excess of OH–, in turn, increased that value. Based on the results shown in Figure 8, in the range up
to pHPZC, the solution pH increased when interacting with
the MPC. This is explained by the fact that the adsorption of H+ ions on the material surface of the material occurred, therefore,
the MPC surface was negatively charged.34,35

between the equilibrium and initial pH values obtained
for the interaction between HCl and NaOH with the adsorbent.

3.4 Kinetic Study
The adsorption kinetics
depends on many factors. To describe the adsorption rate, it is necessary
to take into account the limiting step for the process. As for any
heterogeneous chemical reaction, the adsorption reaction can take
place in the diffusion region, when the delivery of the adsorbate
to the adsorbent surface is the limiting step for the adsorption,
and in the kinetic region, when the chemisorption rate is the limiting
stage for the process.31

Furthermore,
kinetic studies of the MO and MG adsorption on the MPC material were
carried out (Figure 9). It was found that adsorption equilibrium was reached within 10
min for both dyes, and the experimental adsorption capacity of the
material is 827.5 and 2484.5 mg g–1 for the MO and
MG, respectively.

Figure 9 Experimental data on the kinetics of the MO and MG adsorption
on
the MPC adsorbent.

Various models such as
pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order, Elovich,
intraparticle, and external diffusion were implemented to study the
adsorption kinetics and describe the process (Table 2).

Due to the complexity of quantitative
description of mixed diffusion
processes using simple models, one should analyze the possibility
of implementing very common phenomenological models simulating mass
transfer processes through formal chemical kinetic equations.35−37

As seen in Figure 10, the pseudo-first-order model38 satisfactorily
(R2 = 0.9094) describes only MO adsorption.
The correspondence of the experimental data to this model suggested
that a chemical interaction occurred between the MO organic molecules
and the active sites of the adsorbent in the course of the adsorption.39

Figure 10 Pseudo-first-order kinetics of the MO and MG adsorption
on the
MPC adsorbent.

Figure 11a,b presents
the −ln(1 – F) vs t plot, consisting of two linear parts related to the adsorption stages,
from which it can be assumed that the kinetics of the MO and MG adsorption
on the MPC material is controlled by external diffusion in the liquid
film surrounding the adsorbent surface over the entire time interval.40,41Figure 11c,d confirms
the occurrence of intraparticle diffusion42 and its contribution to the overall process rate. Since there are
two linear sections that do not pass through the origin, the adsorption
process can be characterized by mixed diffusion. For each stage, the
adsorption rate constants were determined.

Figure 11 Kinetic models implemented
to describe the MO and MG adsorption
on the MPC adsorbent. External diffusion: MO (a) and MG (b), intraparticle
diffusion: MO (c) and MG (d), pseudo-second-order (e), and Elovich
(f).

The pseudo-second-order model
(Figure 11e)43 describes
the process through the calculation of the k2 and Qe parameters. This equation
successfully fits the adsorption of both dyes (R2 = 1 and 0.999 for the MO and MG, respectively), and the Qe values (833.3 and 2500 mg g–1 for the MO and MG, respectively) assessed on its bases were very
close to the experimentally obtained Qe values (827.5 and 2484.5 mg g–1 for the MO and
MG, respectively). The pseudo-second-order model suggested that the
chemical exchange reaction contributed to the overall rate of the
process, but did not limit it.43

The correspondence between the experimental data and the Elovich
model44 (Figure 11f) stands for heterogeneity of the adsorbent
surface.45−47 The high determination coefficient for MO adsorption
(R2 = 0.9113) stands for the availability
of energetically heterogeneous active sites on the adsorbent surface.
However, MG adsorption is not described by this model, since the experimental
data are unsatisfactorily approximated in the corresponding coordinate
plane (R2 = 0.4242).

As can be seen
in Tables 3 and 4, for MO, most intensive adsorption
occurred during the diffusion process for a finite period of time,
whereas for MG, at the initial stage. The “adsorbate–adsorbate”
chemical interaction characterized by the pseudo-second-order model
took place at slower rates (k2 = 0.002
and 0.0008 g mg–1 min–1 for the
MO and MG, respectively).43 The c values allow the determination of the boundary layer thickness.
A larger c value is related to a greater boundary
layer diffusion effect. The obtained estimates are well correlated
with the data reported in the literature, wherein the kinetics of
MO and MG adsorption on the carbon nanomaterials was also found to
be accompanied by diffusion with the influence of chemical transformations.45

3.5 Isotherm Study
Figure 12 demonstrates the isotherms
constructed for the MO and MG adsorption on the MPC material based
on the experimental data.

Figure 12 Experimental data obtained for the MO (a) and
MG (b) adsorption
on the MPC material.

According to the isotherm
classification given by Giles and his
colleagues,48,49 and considering the isotherm
shape, the above curves may be related to H- and S-type isotherms
(in cases of the MO and MG adsorption, respectively). The H-type isotherm
(the MO adsorption) implies a progressive saturation of the adsorbent,
by achieving high adsorption properties at low adsorbate concentrations
due to the very strong adsorbate–adsorbent affinity.50,51 The S-type isotherm (the MG adsorption), refers to a situation when
the adsorbate molecule is monofunctional, has moderate intermolecular
attraction causing cooperative adsorption, and meets strong competition
from molecules of the solvent or of another adsorbed species.48,52

3.5.1 Common Adsorption Isotherm Models
To
describe adsorption processes, the empirical Langmuir, Freundlich,
Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich equations (Table 5) can be implemented.

Dubinin–Radushkevich Adsorption Modelsa

Linear Forms of
the Equations	
				
a Qmax: maximum adsorption
capacity, mg g–1; C: equilibrium
concentration, mg L–1; b: adsorbent–adsorbate
affinity distribution (adsorption
energy), L mg–1; n: adsorption
favorability indicator; k: adsorption capacity of
the adsorbent, mg g–1 L mg–1; KT: equilibrium binding constant corresponding
to the maximum binding energy, L mg–1; B: constant related to the heat of adsorption; Kad: Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm constant, mol2 k–1J–2; and ε:
Polanyi potential, kJ mol–1.

To describe isotherms of adsorption
of ions and molecules of various
substances, the Langmuir equation,53 which
is based on the fact that the localization of the substance on the
adsorbent surface proceeds through a single mechanism, is often used.
It is, generally, stated that a monomolecular adsorbate layer is formed
on the adsorbent surface, and all active sites possess the same energy
and enthalpy. Besides, there exists the other important parameter
of the monolayer adsorption–separation (or equilibrium) factor
(RL), also evaluated herein. It is determined
by the following relation 11  where Co is MO
concentration (mg L–1).

The RL value indicates whether the
process is unfavorable (RL > 1), linear
(RL = 1), favorable (0 < RL <1), or irreversible (RL = 0).54

The Freundlich equation55 is implemented
to describe adsorption on the heterogeneous surface. Since, according
to this model, adsorption sites have different energy values, active
adsorption locations possessing maximum energy are filled at first.51 The Temkin model56 supposes that the adsorption energy decreases linearly with the
surface coverage due to adsorbent–adsorbate interactions.57 It predicts a uniform distribution of binding
energies over the population of surface sites. The range and distribution
of the binding energies should strongly depend on the density and
distribution of functional groups and the adsorbent surface.

To study adsorption mechanisms, the equilibrium data are processed
using the Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models.58,59 It is more general than Langmuir isotherm since it does not assume
surface homogeneity and adsorption potential constancy. This isotherm
is widely implemented to elucidate the nature (physical or chemical)
of the adsorbate adsorption on the adsorbent and to estimate the mean
free energy of adsorption (E, kJ mol–1).60 The adsorbate binding mechanism can
be judged by the E value expressed by the following
equation 12  At E < 8 kJ
mol–1, the adsorption process is of a physical nature,
whereas at E lying in the range of 8–16 kJ
mol–1, the adsorption proceeds through ion exchange,
and at E ranging from 16 to 40 kJ mol–1, chemisorption
takes place. In terms of Qmax, the porosity
of the adsorbent can be judged: the larger this value, the more developed
the porosity and the less the pore diameter.53,54,60

The experimental data fitted to Langmuir,
Freundlich, Temkin, and
Dubinin–Radushkevich models are presented in Figure 13a–f, and the calculated
parameters of these equations are listed in Table 6.

The 1/n index characterizes the degree of approximation
of the isotherm to the straight line. The n values
being equal to 2–10 represent good adsorption, whereas the
values equal to 1–2, moderately satisfactory adsorption, and
< 1, represent poor adsorption.37,61 Since the n value was found to be > 2 herein, MPC can be considered
a good material for the MO adsorption. The 1/n slope
ranging between 0 and 1 stands for the adsorption intensity or surface
heterogeneity. The adsorbent surface is more heterogeneous as its
value gets closer to 0.49 The RL values obtained for MO and MG adsorption on the MPC
material were found to be < 1 and > 0, thereby indicating favorable
adsorption.58

According to the Temkin
model, adsorption sites have different
activities on the adsorbent surface and can be characterized by some
continuous activity distribution, or they have the same activity,
but the activity of each site decreases as a result of the presence
of chemisorbed molecules close to it.40 Moreover, larger the number of the chemisorbed molecules, the more
the initial activity of this site changes, i.e., the activity of each
site and all free sites together decreases with an increase in the
surface coverage of the adsorbate. According to the given dependencies
(Figure 13e,f), only
MO adsorption can be described by this model.

From the linear
plot of the Dubinin–Radushkevich model (Table 6), which satisfactorily
fits the data (R2 = 0.9297 and 0.8753
for the MO and MG, respectively), Qmax was found to be 749.41 and 1941.8 mg g–1, whereas E was found to be 2.56 and 0.049 KJ mol–1 for the MO and MG, respectively, indicating a physical adsorption
process taking place.

3.5.2 Langmuir–Freundlich
(Sips) Isotherm
Models
Langmuir–Freundlich (Sips) model overcomes
some of the constraints for Freundlich and Langmuir single models,
such as the heterogeneity of solid-phase sites involved in the adsorption
process, and considers that the adsorption energy ranges from 0 to
∞.62−64 It is expressed as follows 13  where b is the average value
of the adsorbent–adsorbate affinity distribution or the adsorption
energy (L mg–1), Qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity of the material for the adsorbate
(mg g–1), and n is the adsorption
intensity (dimensionless). For independent noninteracting sites, n = 1, in the case of n > 1, positive
adsorption
cooperativity takes place, whereas in the case of n < 1, negative cooperativity can be supposed.65,66

Since the adsorption capacity of the studied adsorbates changes
when increasing the initial and, correspondingly, the equilibrium
adsorbate concentration, adsorption sites with different binding energies
and affinities may be considered, making it possible to modify this
equation as follows.67 14  where all of the parameters are
the same as
described in eq 12,
and the subindices 1 and 2 stand for two different kinds of adsorption
sites available on the material surface, higher energy (referred to
surface complexation and chemical interactions), and lower energy
(associated with ionic exchange and electrostatic interactions), respectively.

Regarding Langmuir–Freundlich one-site fitting, the model
successfully describes the adsorption of all of the dyes on the materials
(R2 = 0.9666 and 0.9121 for the MO and
MG, respectively). Analyzing the parameters obtained (Table 7), it was found that the MO
possesses higher (23 times) adsorbent–adsorbate affinity and
lower (2 times) adsorption capacity compared with the MG. The adsorption
cooperativity is negative in the case of the MO, and positive for
the MG.

Langmuir–Freundlich Model

MG	0.005	1896	4.15	0.912	0.006	0.006	782	752	4.03	4.03	0.762	
The great difference in the affinity can imply the
availability
of different types of adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface. This
assumption was confirmed by the dual-site model, especially for MO
(R2 = 0.9950). As can be seen in Table 5, in the case of MO,
the magnitudes of the b1 and b2 values (b1 > b2 by ≈179 times) indicate clear availability
of
at least two types of adsorption sites on the material surface, inner-sphere
higher-energy, or specific, sites (subindex 1). It is promoting chemical
interactions and surface complexation, possessing a higher affinity
for the adsorbate, and outer-sphere lower-energy, or nonspecific,
sites (subindex 2). These are responsible for ion exchange and electrostatic
interactions, possessing a lower affinity for the adsorbate. The approximate
percentage number of each type of site available on the adsorbent
surface was estimated using the relation of Qmax1 and Qmax2 values to their
sum Qmax1 + Qmax2. It was found that the percentage of lower-energy sites available
on the MPC surface was about 92%, meaning that these sites mostly
contributed to the MO adsorption process. The other 8% belonged to
higher-energy sites, which also contributed to MO adsorption, especially
at lower adsorbate concentrations, and, moreover, impede further MO
desorption. Besides, based on n1 and n2 values, one may suppose that lower-energy
sites exhibited negative cooperativity (n2 < 1) for MPC material, whereas the cooperativity of higher-energy
sites was positive (n1 > 1).

In the case of MG, the dual-site Langmuir–Freundlich equation
showed a worse fit to the experimental data (R2 = 0.7622). It almost satisfactorily explains MG adsorption
up to the peak at C = 541.07 mg L–1, where maximum Qe = 2153.58 mg g–1 was achieved (Figure 12b), but it did not completely describe the
process at higher concentrations. Based on the equality of b1 and b2 parameters
obtained, it can be supposed that MG adsorption was governed only
by low-energy sites, and it was more homogeneous. The decrease in
the adsorption capacity at concentrations higher than 541.07 mg L–1 and lower than 922.29 mg L–1 (Figure 12b) might be due
to MG lixiviation from the adsorbent surface provoked by weak electrostatic
forces. This might also be due to other processes such as precipitation.
However, at concentrations higher than 922.29 mg L–1, the material surface started saturating again, and the adsorption
capacity increased.

This work carried out Experimental studies,
which aimed at comparing
the adsorption capacity of the MPC developed to that of activated
carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) are described
in the present work. The data are presented in Table 8.

The analysis
of the tabular data shows that the MPC developed by
the authors appears to be the most efficient adsorption material for
removing the target organic dyes from aqueous solutions.

4 Comparison with Other Adsorbents
The results of review
studies in the field of the MG and MO organic
dyes adsorption are shown in Table 9, which presents the conditions for conducting experimental
studies on the extraction process and the adsorption capacity values
for various nanocarbon materials and composites. Comparing the above
parameters with the results obtained in this work, the following can
be noted: some literature sources report a high sorption capacity
of the studied materials, comparable with the values obtained by the
authors. But when analyzing the adsorption conditions, it turns out
that to achieve such high adsorption capacity values, it took either
twice as much time or the weighed portion of the adsorbent was several
times higher.

Thus, it can be concluded
that the adsorption material obtained
by the authors is more efficient and suitable for the adsorption of
organic molecules in comparison with the other nanocomposite materials.

5 Recyclability of the Adsorbent
The mesoporous nanocomposite
developed herein is an analogue of
conventional types of activated carbons by its chemical nature and
physical–mechanical properties, which makes it possible to
efficiently use traditional methods for regenerating and restoring
the operational properties of activated carbons (treatment with superheated
steam and heated inert gas, liquid-phase desorption with low-boiling
solvents, thermal and chemical degradation of the pollutant, etc.)
for a given spent material.

6 Mechanism of Adsorption
The mechanism of adsorption is shown in Figures 14 and 15. These figures
show the most probable mechanism of the MO and MG dye adsorption.
According to the experimental studies and analytical processing of
the obtained data, the interaction between the graphene surface of
CNTs, which form the framework of the MPC material under study, and
the organic molecules are mainly of physical nature. It is assumed
that due to the van der Waals forces, the flat organic molecule is
oriented parallelly to the graphene plane, occupying an energetically
advantageous position. This hypothesis can be confirmed by the calculated
values of free energy of adsorption (E, kJ mol–1) based on the Dubinin–Radushkevich model: E was found to be 2.56 and 0.049 KJ mol–1 for the MO and MG, respectively, thereby indicating a physical adsorption
process taking place.

7 Conclusions
The
kinetic and equilibrium characteristics (rate constants, maximum
adsorption capacity, mean free energy, etc.) of the adsorption of
dyes (anionic: MO and cationic: MG) on the novel material (MPC) were
studied. The physical and chemical characteristics of this material
were determined by different techniques such as SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy,
TG, and X-ray diffractometry. The efficient adsorbent dosages were
found to be 0.03 and 0.005 g/30 mL for the MO and MG, respectively.
The determination of isoionic point (pHPZC = 5) made it
possible to establish that the adsorption of positive ions and molecules
from solutions was most preferable on the developed material under
the selected experimental conditions (solution pH = 3). For both dyes,
adsorption equilibrium was reached within 10 min. It was elucidated
that the limiting stages of MG and MO absorption were controlled by
chemical (as confirmed by the correlation of the experimental data
in the coordinate planes of the pseudo-first- and second-order equations)
and mixed interaction (intraparticle and external) diffusion. The
maximum adsorption capacity of the MPC material was found to be 827.5
and 2484.5 mg g–1 for MO and MG, respectively. By
implementing the Dubinin–Radushkevich model, it was found that
the adsorption of the dye molecules was physical (E = 2.56 and 0.049 kJ mol–1 for the MO and MG, respectively).
The process was satisfactorily described by the Langmuir model, meaning
that the monolayer was formed on the adsorbent surface at the initial
period of time. Besides, the experimental data were reliably described
by Freundlich and Temkin equations, thereby indicating multimolecular
adsorption of the dyes on heterogeneous (regarding the binding energy)
active adsorption sites of the material, especially in the case of
MO. The adsorption mechanisms of the two dyes considered herein differ
from each other. The most likely reason is their ionic nature. This
difference was confirmed by implementing one- and two-site Langmuir–Freundlich
(Sips) models, based on which it was found that MO adsorption proceeded
not only on lower-energy sites (92%) but also on the high energy ones
(8%), especially at lower MO concentrations. Thus, it was assumed
that the process mostly took place through ion exchange and electrostatic
interactions, and at lower MO concentrations, through chemical interactions
and surface complexation as well. MG adsorption took place only on
lower-energy sites, and thus, more homogeneous. Due to the weak binding
forces of these sites, the process was accompanied by MG lixiviation
or other processes (e.g., precipitation) at higher equilibrium concentrations
(between 541.07 than 922.29 mg L–1), after which
the adsorption continued. Thus, it was concluded that the adsorbent
proposed herein possessed a high adsorption capacity within the short
time to reach equilibrium and may be considered promising in removing
organic pollutants, in particular, azo dyes such as MO and MG.
