Maximal resection of intrinsic brain
tumors is a major prognostic factor for survival. Real-time intraoperative
imaging tools, including ultrasound (US),
are crucial for maximal resection of such tumors. Microbubbles (MBs)
are clinically used in daily practice as a contrast agent for ultrasound
and can be further developed to serve combined therapeutic and diagnostic
purposes. To achieve this goal, we have developed novel MBs conjugated
to specific ligands to receptors which are overexpressed in brain
tumors. These MBs are designed to target a tumor tissue, visualize
it, and deliver therapeutic molecules into it. The objective of this
study was to assess the biodistribution of the test items: We used
MBs labeled with indocyanine green (MB-ICG) for visualization and
MBs conjugated to a cyclic molecule containing the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) labeled with ICG (MB-RGD-ICG) to target brain tumor integrins
as the therapeutic tools. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a single
dose of each MB preparation. The identification of the MB in various
organs was monitored by fluorescence microscopy in anesthetized animals
as well as real-time US for brain imaging. Equally sized control groups
under identical conditions were used in this study. One control group
was used to establish fluorescence background conditions (ICG), and
two control groups were used to test autofluorescence from the test
items (MBs and MB-RGD). ICG with or without MBs (naked or RGD-modified)
was detected in the brain vasculature and also in other organs. The
pattern, duration, and intensity of the fluorescence signal could
not be differentiated between animals treated with ICG alone and animals
treated with microbubbles MBs-ICG or MBs-RGD-ICG. Following MB injection,
either naked or combined with RGD, there was a sharp rise in the Doppler
signal within seconds of injection in the brain. The signal was mainly
located at the choroid plexus, septum pellucidum, and the meninges
of the brain. The signal subsided within a few minutes. Injection
of saline or ICG alone to respective animals did not result in a similar
raised signal. Following a single intravenous administration of MB-ICG
and MB-RGD-ICG to rats, the MBs were found to be effectively present
in the brain.

==== Body
Introduction
Gliomas represent approximately
one-third of all primary brain tumors1 characterized
by an infiltrative growth pattern into the brain parenchyma. Glioblastoma
is the most common and deadliest malignant tumor of the central nervous
system (CNS) with a median survival of only 14 months2 and a 5 year survival rate of 5.5%.3 Surgery is the first step in a multimodal therapy for malignant
glioma. The extent of resection is a key surgical outcome variable
for reducing tumor recurrence and improving symptom management, quality
of life, progression-free survival, and overall survival in glioma
patients.2,4−10 However,
it is well known that tumor margins, due to their infiltrative growth,
are difficult to depict. While complete surgical resection of these
infiltrative tumors is often hampered by the absence of intraoperative
real-time imaging, more surgical tools are emerging to assist neurosurgeons
to identify the tumor’s boundaries during surgery. Existing
surgical modalities, such as intraoperative neuronavigation, 5-aminolevulinic
acid (5-ALA) fluorescence-guided tumor resection, and intraoperative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while allowing the surgeon to evaluate
intraoperatively the extent of resection, all have their own limitations.9,10 A limitation of standard frameless stereotactic navigation is the
lack of an updated navigational dataset during brain tumor resections.
Brain shift related to loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain dependency,
edema, and tumor removal results in anatomical inaccuracies. Intraoperative
MRI (iMRI) can be used to determine the extent of residual tumor burden
and provide updated navigational data. Nevertheless, it requires highly
constructive, logistic, and pecuniary effort associated with high
costs and prolongation of the total operative time.11 5-ALA is a hemeprecursor that induces synthesis and accumulation
of fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in malignant glioma but not
in low-grade glioma tissues.11 Intraoperative
ultrasonography (IOUS) is a widely accessible, practical, and cost-effective
imaging modality that provides real-time surgical guidance with minimal
identified risks or additional operative time compared to other modalities.
Accumulating data show a strong correlation between IOUS and postoperative
MRI findings when evaluating the extent of tumor resection, suggesting
that IOUS may have significant clinical implications. Furthermore,
IOUS has the potential to compensate for brain shift due to CSF loss
and tissue edema, which renders neuronavigation less reliable. Still,
the difficult image interpretation is one of its major limitations.7 Therefore, in order to better visualize tumor
borders and to improve resection completeness, an enhanced intraoperative
ultrasound (US) image quality combined with direct microscopy visualization
is highly desirable.

In glioblastoma, the MB’s shell
may allow for specific binding to the tumor vasculature. Also, the
possibility to carry drugs can make MBs a theranostic platform providing
imaging and therapeutic treatment at the tumor site with the same
device.6 Among endothelial cell receptors,
αvβ3 integrin is considered a promising
target for molecular imaging of cancer being expressed during angiogenesis,12 a process necessary for malignant tumor growth
and metastasis, as in the case of glioblastoma.13−15 The αvβ3 integrin binds arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences of
matrix proteins.16 As a result, the decoration
of the MB surface with a cyclic analog of RGD may lead to selective
adherence of MBs to the tumor microvessel endothelium and specific
accumulation in the tumor site.15 MB lipid
shells labeled with fluorophores, such as indocyanine green (ICG),
can also offer the possibility for direct fluorescent visualization
through an operative microscope.17,18 Thus, the lipid
MBs would be able to support multimodal tumor visualization, allowing
for real-time intraoperative imaging during surgical resection via
both US and in parallel fusion to the operative microscope.

In order to develop a compound for better visualization of tumor
vasculature in humans, we assessed the biodistribution of MBs in the
body of a rat model. Specifically, we investigated the biodistribution
of a naked MB, the MB labeled with ICG (MB-ICG), the MB attached to
RGD (MB-RGD), and the MB labeled with ICG and attached to RGD (MB-RGD-ICG)
following single intravenous (IV) injection to male Sprague Dawley
rats.

Materials and Methods
1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC),
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DPPG-Na), and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] ammonium salt (DSPE-PEG2000-Mal) were purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids. tert-Butanol (t-BuOH), palmitic acid (PA), poly(ethylene glycol) with a molecular
weight of Mr = 3500–4500 (PEG 4000),
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) at pH 7.4, and ethanol were from Sigma-Aldrich. BODIPY FL l-cystine and immobilized TCEP disulfide reducing gel were from
Thermo Fisher Scientific. Cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys),
(c-RGDfC) peptide, was purchased from Peptides International
and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from Rivoira Gas and indocyanine
green (ICG) from Pulsion Medical Systems. Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs) in SupplementMix (Promocell) and HEPES buffered saline
solution (HEPES-BSS) were from Promocell. μ-Slide I 0.4 ibiTreat
and the Flow Through kit were from Ibidi. Water of Milli-Q purity
grade (18.2 MΩ·cm) was produced with a deionization apparatus
(Elga PureLab Classic).

MB Preparation
Targeted MB
MBs were synthesized
as reported in Grossman et al.19 A lyophilized
powder was prepared after dissolving in tert-butanol
a mixture of 37.5 mol % DSPC, 37.5 mol % DPPG, 23 mol % PA, and 2
mol % DSPE-PEG2000-Mal together with PEG 4000. MBs were formed under
a SF6 atmosphere by dispersing in PBS an aliquot of the
resultant powder; the suspension was manually shaken until a white
homogeneous liquid was obtained.

After washing the bubbles from
the lipid excess by centrifugation, the coupling reaction of maleimide-MBs
with cysteine-tagged RGD (c-RGDfC) was carried out
according to the scheme in Figure 1. Immediately before the coupling reaction, the peptide
was reduced with TCEP (3.6 mM) to exclude possible disulfide bonds
between cysteine residues of c-RGDfC. After that,
MBs were reacted for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS-containing EDTA (5 mM)
with an amount of c-RGDfC corresponding to 10 times
the moles of DSPE-PEG2000-Mal in the MB sample. Targeted MBs-RGDs
were washed from the unbound peptide by three rounds of centrifugation
and stored as lyophilized powder. After each centrifugation step,
MBs-RGDs were resuspended in PBS-containing 10% w/v maltose as a cryoprotectant.

via thioether bonding: maleimide-MB is reacted with a sulfhydryl reagent
(c-RGDfC or reduced BODIPY-cystine).

Naked MBs
Nonfunctionalized,
plain lipid MBs (naked MBs) were prepared as the control test items
by omitting the coupling reaction with the peptide. In this case,
DSPE-PEG2000-Mal was not present in the lipid mixture in tert-butanol.

MB Reconstitution
and ICG Labeling
All lyophilized samples of naked MBs and
MBs-RGD were reconstituted on the spot on the day of the experiment.
In order to do this, before adding the carrier liquid (5 mL of saline),
the headspace of each sample vial was filled with SF6.
Then, the bubbles were formed by manually shaking the resulting suspension
in the presence of SF6. MBs-ICG and MBs-RGD-ICG were prepared
by adding to the MB powder in contact with SF6 the fluorescent
probe solution first (1 mL of ICG, 5 mg/mL, in water) and then saline
up to 5 mL of the final sample volume. Each vial of fresh reconstituted
MBs resulted in an MB suspension of ∼108 MBs/mL.

Ligand Determination on MBs
The amount of attached peptide onto the MB shell via thioether bonding
was evaluated in an indirect way by replacing, during the coupling
reaction, c-RGDfC with a cysteine carrying fluorescent
probe, the reduced form of BODIPY-cystine (see Figure 1). After BODIPY-cystine reduction with TCEP,
the conjugation reaction with maleimide-bearing MBs was carried out
following the very same procedure used for c-RGDfC.
The yield of MB shell modification was evaluated by measuring the
fluorescence of the suspension of BODIPY-MBs disrupted by sonication
and comparing the resulting signal with that from dilutions of a reduced
BODIPY-cystine solution (Figure 2) using an RF-5301 Shimadzu spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu,
Rome, Italy) (excitation and emission slit widths, 1.5 nm; in “high”
sensitivity mode). In order to assess the extent of shell modification
per MB, the concentration of bubble samples as the number of MBs per
milliliter of the MB suspension was determined by optical microscopy
before MB disruption by sonication using a Neubauer chamber.

(blue) and of naked lipid MBs as the control (red). (B)

All measurements were carried out in PBS.

Parallel Plate Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay
HUVECs were cultured in the supplemented endothelial cell growth
medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified atmosphere. Flow
chamber slides (μ-Slides I 0.4, Ibidi) were coated with 2% gelatin
solution then 2.5 × 105 HUVECs were seeded. The μ-Slides
were put upside down in the incubator (HeraCell 150i, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and left in this position overnight to allow cells to
grow and adhere on the roof of the chamber slides. Afterward, cells
were washed three times with PBS and placed in an upright position
under an inverted microscope (Nikon Inverted Microscope Eclipse Ti-E,
Florence, Italy) equipped with a 40× objective (Nikon, Japan),
a motorized stage, and the Zyla sCMOS camera 4.2 (Andor, Belfast,
U.K.) for video recording. Nontargeted plain bubbles and c-RGDfC functionalized lipid MBs (106 MBs/mL) were pumped
into the channel slide with a syringe pump at a constant flux of 0.76
mL/min, corresponding to a shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2. After
10 min, five different fields of view were captured using bright field
microscopy (Nikon NIS-Element AR, Florence, Italy). Then, the channel
slide was inverted upside down for 5 min, placed upright under the
microscope, and perfused further for 10 min with PBS to wash out the
unspecifically adhered and easily detachable MBs. Pictures corresponding
to five different fields of view were captured again.

Animals
Seven-week-old male Sprague Dawley
rats weighing 205 g (183–226 g) were obtained from Envigo RMS,
Israel. All dosing solutions were injected by single IV injection
into one of the animal’s tail veins. Test items and saline
controls were injected in volume doses of 4 mL/kg corresponding to
692 mg/kg of formulations containing naked MBs, MBs labeled with indocyanine
green (MB-ICG) for visualization, MBs conjugated to a cyclic molecule
containing the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), and MBs labeled RGD and
ICG (MB-RGD-ICG). The animals were observed for a total duration of
up to 15 min post dosing (Table 1). The identification of the MB in various organs was
monitored by fluorescence microscopy in anesthetized animals as well
as real-time US for brain imaging. Equally sized control groups under
identical conditions were used in this study. One control group was
used to establish fluorescence background conditions (ICG), and two
control groups were used to test autofluorescence from the test items
(MBs and MB-RGD). This study was performed following an application
form review by the National Council for Animal Experimentation and
after receiving approval (no. 15–06-182) that the study complies
with the rules and regulations set forth.

Fluorescence Imaging
Following each surgical procedure,
animals were placed in a suitable recumbence to allow visualization
of ICG using a Pentero classic surgical microscope (OPMI Pentero flow
800, Carl Zeiss, Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) equipped with an IR800
functionality, and representative images were taken for evaluation.

Ultrasound Imaging
Ultrasound
imaging was used on all animals in the study to visualize the blood
flow in the brain. A Mindray M9 ultrasound machine (Mindray Co, ShenZhen,
China) connected to a linear array (6–14 MHz) transducer was
used.

Termination
At termination
of the study, animals were euthanized by severing of the heart.

Data Evaluation
Evaluation of
the presence or absence of MBs in the examined tissues was based on
assessing the difference between the fluorescence pattern and intensity
of a test item compared to the fluorescence pattern and intensity
of a control item. The autofluorescence observed in a respective control
item was taken into account (tested MB without ICG).

Results
Characterization
of MB Contrast Agents
All of the MBs used in this study had
a mean diameter of approximately 2.8 μm with less than 2% of
a diameter above 9 μm. Figure 3 is a fluorescence image of reconstituted lipid MBs
after ICG labeling showing accumulation of the fluorescent dye on
the shells.

Figure 3 Wide-field

was captured by a Nikon Inverted Microscope Eclipse Ti-E equipped
with an LED source emitting at 770 nm (pE-100 LED, CoolLED Ltd., U.K.),
a filter block containing an excitation filter, a dichroic beamsplitter
(mirror) and a barrier/emission filter dedicated to ICG imaging (Chroma
Technology, VT, U.S.A.), and a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor, U.K.).

The feasibility of surface functionalization of
maleimide-bearing MBs via thioether bonding with the thiol carrying
ligand c-RGDfC was probed with the fluorescent marker
BODIPY-cystine. By this way the extent of conjugation was evaluated
with fluorescence spectroscopy resulting in 1.9 × 106 molecules of ligands per MB. Since the MB concentration after bubble
reconstitution is 2.5 × 108 MBs/mL, a volume dose of 4 mL/kg
of the test item corresponds to a dose of the peptide of 2 μg/kg.
The success of shell functionalization with c-RGDfC
was confirmed by testing the functional adhesion of targeted MBs in
a parallel plate flow chamber experiment. HUVECs were chosen as the
positive control cell line for αvβ3 expression, the integrin recognized by the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence
presented by the surface of the modified lipid MBs. The cells were
grown on the upper wall of the chamber slide in order to guarantee
optimal exposure conditions for contact with floating bubbles. Figure 4 shows the MB adhesion
after 10 min of infusion of fresh PBS washing out nonfirmly and unspecifically
bound MBs: RGD-MBs allowed efficient targeting of αvβ3 integrin-expressing cells (16.7 ± 2.2 RGD-MBs/HUVEC).

These results and the favorable outcome of the toxicological studies19 demonstrate that the prepared functionalized
MBs have the potential to be useful as a dual-modal targeted contrast
agent. The next step was therefore to investigate the biodistribution
in the body and especially in the brain of rats.

Animal Studies
No treatment-related mortality occurred
in any of the animals throughout the entire observation period. All
groups had a comparable group mean body weight at dosing.

Fluorescence Biodistribution
Slight autofluorescence
was seen in the nonglandular stomach (forestomach) and in the eyes
of animals injected with no fluorescence marker (ICG). This autofluorescence
had a markedly lower intensity compared to the intensity seen in organs
from animals injected with ICG. ICG was detected in the following
organs of all animals injected with ICG alone or ICG with MBs (naked
and RGD): eyes, brain, liver, stomach, spleen, intestine, kidneys,
adrenals, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, testis, sternum,
heart, and lungs. Additionally, the vascular system surrounding the
cecum and testis was also visualized by fluorescence. A fluorescence
signal was detected with the greatest intensity in the liver and the
eyes, to a lesser intensity in the kidneys, adrenal, intestine, brain,
and lungs, and at low intensity in the rest of the organs listed above.
The pattern, duration, and intensity of the fluorescence signal could
not be differentiated between animals treated with ICG alone and animals
treated with MBs, MBs-ICG or MBs-RGD-ICG (Table 1). Representative photos of different organs
in both white light and fluorescence following the different treatments
are presented below (Figures 5–9).

Ultrasound Biodistribution
Following MB injection (either
naked or RGD), there was a sharp rise in the Doppler signal within
seconds of injection. The signal was mainly located at the choroid
plexus, septum pellucidum, and the meninges in the brain. The signal
subsided within a few minutes. Following a saline injection to the
same respective animal (several minutes after test item injection
in all MB-containing test items, i.e., groups 2M–5M), the rise
in the Doppler signal was not observed. Additionally, following ICG
injection alone (group 1M), no sharp rise in the Doppler signal was
observed, and the signal was equivalent to that seen in following
saline injections (Figures 10–13).

Discussion
Recent advances in the field of neuroimaging and the development
of novel MBs have improved the options for real-time imaging during
brain surgery. Many engineered nano- and microparticles, including
MBs, can be easily manipulated to serve as an imaging agent as well
as for drug delivery, especially in the setting of brain surgery.

Reported here is the whole body biodistribution in rats after IV
injection of lipid MBs with a modified shell surface suitable for
tumor vasculature targeting and NIR fluorescence imaging. The engineered
MBs used in this study included bubbles physically labeled with the
NIR probe ICG and covalently conjugated with the tumor-targeting peptide c-RGDfC with a relatively narrow size range (±1 μm)
and are well dispersed, thus facilitating the IV administration. Preliminary
studies using the peptide motif have been performed, and results suggest
the strategy to be safe and specific.16

In fact, we have just recently investigated the potential
toxicity of these MB compounds in vivo.19 Following IV injections of two doses of plain MBs and MBs engineered
for targeting and NIR fluorescence visualization, animals were closely
monitored for potential acute and chronic responses. No mortality
occurred during the study period in any of the dosing groups. Body
weights were stable during the study period. Minor, mostly reversible
changes in hematological and biochemical analyses were observed in
some of the treated animals. All changes were reversible after 7 days.
Histopathology examination in the high-dose animals showed development
of foreign body granulomatous inflammation, and we concluded that
the low-dose tested items appear to be safe. Furthermore, the in vitro
studies demonstrated that the targeted MBs are able to functionally
adhere onto cell substrates expressing the proper receptor. Accordingly,
we proceeded with the low-dose tested items to test its efficacy.

Due to the relatively short half-life of MBs,20 the 15 min time point was chosen to best represent initial
uptake in individual internal organs. Our results show a rapid uptake
of both the test and control items in the liver, and a pattern was
found also for free ICG21,22 and in other studies
on MBs.20,23,24 The US results,
directly linked to the presence of MBs registered in the brain, were
compared to those of the intraoperative microscope with the IR filter
and confirmed that the engineered MBs rapidly reach the brain. In
targeted US imaging, it is crucial that the US imaging signal from
MBs suitably modified with a marker for functional adhesion can be
differentiated from the background imaging signal. This is a challenge
in tissues with a high level of nonspecific MB accumulation.20 In our case, the fluorescence signal in the
organs besides the liver, such as in the brain, was moderate suggesting
that a specific signal from a tumor vasculature could be obtained
by targeted imaging using a dedicated US sequence, with the background
distribution level of targeted MBs being low in the surrounding normal
tissue.

One limitation of our biodistribution study was that
we did not covalently anchored ICG to MB surfaces, and as a consequence,
the fluorescence signal visualized by using the surgical microscope
came not only from the physically adsorbed labeled ICG-MBs but also
from the injected medium as free ICG. We opted for the NIR dye ICG,
taking advantage of the ability of ICG to incorporate stably into
lipid membranes,25 its detection even in
deeper tissues during the operation, its ability of improving the
recognition of residual microtumors during surgical operations, and
the fact that it is an FDA/EMA-approved molecule for use in humans.
Moreover, since lipid MBs are already EMA-approved for use in humans,
we postulated that the potential final microdevice formulation, which
includes functional modified lipid MBs physically labeled with ICG,
would be more easily translated into the clinical arena.

Conclusions
Following single IV administrations
of the test items MB-ICG and MB-RGD-ICG to male Sprague Dawley rats,
the test items are present in the brain. These data were confirmed
by both US imaging, which is specific for MBs, and by NIR fluorescence
imaging. It is likely that the test items are also distributed to
other tissues with a rapid uptake by the liver; however, because of
the limitations of the imaging techniques and the presence of free
dye in the labeled MBs samples, biodistribution to other organs cannot
be proven. From the data on in vivo whole-body biodistribution of
lipid MBs reported in the literature, we can hypothesize a similar
fate also for the MBs presented in this work. According to this, upon
injection, MBs circulate within the vascular system due to size and
deformability similar to that of erythrocytes. Their persistence in
the blood circulation depends on the dissolution rate of the gaseous
core and on the rate of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system.
In vivo imaging studies revealed that increasing the microbubble diameter
and/or concentration significantly increases circulation persistence
from ca. 1.5 min for 2 μm-sized bubbles to 6 min for 6 μm-sized
bubbles.26 Six minutes is reported also
as the elimination half-life of the marketed UCA Sonovue.27 Further, dynamic micropositron emission tomography
(micro-PET) in living mice of lipid-shelled MBs targeted to tumor
angiogenesis-related vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor
2 (VEGFR2) demonstrated that 50% of targeted MBs cleared after approximately
3.5 min, and approximately 95% were cleared from the blood circulation
after 30 min with a rapid uptake and retention of targeted MBs in
both the liver and spleen.20 Several studies
demonstrated significant accumulation of lipid-shelled MBs in the
liver and spleen with some variation according to the animal model
and microbubble construct. This retention is most likely due to phagocytosis
by Kupffer cells in the liver and by macrophages and the mononuclear
phagocyte system in the spleen.20,28 Finally, we cannot exclude
pulmonary macrophage contribution in lung clearance and also pulmonary
entrapment of MBs with a diameter greater than 5 μm. Intravital
microscopy studies revealed that the majority of entrapped lipid MBs
became ellipsoidal indicating that microvascular entrapment is a transient
phenomenon due to MB deformability with 85% of MBs dislodged by 10
min and no adverse hemodynamic effects.29 Then, when the microbubble shell collapses, the relatively inert
gas (perfluorocarbon gases or SF6) is released into the
plasma and exhaled via the lungs.27

In conclusion, after IV injection, the use of the MBs was safe with
no treatment-related mortality occurring in any of the animals throughout
the entire observation period. Furthermore, the ability of MBs to
localize in the brain opens the possibility to test the efficacy of
targeted MBs performing future US molecular imaging experiments in
a rat brain tumor model.
