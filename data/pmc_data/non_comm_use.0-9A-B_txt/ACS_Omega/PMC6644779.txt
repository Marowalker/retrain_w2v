The utility of a chiral Ru–prolinamide
catalytic system
has been demonstrated in one-pot synthesis of optically active β-triazolylethanol
and β-hydroxy sulfone derivatives. The said methodology proceeds
through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of in situ formed ketones
of the corresponding chiral products. Various chiral prolinamide ligands
were screened, and ligand L6 with isopropyl groups substituted
at the ortho position has shown excellent activity at 60 °C in
aqueous medium producing up to 95% yield and 99.9% enantioselectivity.

Introduction
One-pot
organic transformation is an excellent tool to construct
complex molecules involving relatively cheap and easily accessible
starting materials.1 This methodology includes
a one-pot sequential reaction, one-pot tandem reaction, which converts
readily available raw materials into highly value-added products.
From a green chemistry point of view, this type of transformation
is essential because it avoids multistep reactions, thereby decreasing
waste production. In addition, there is no need of isolation of the
intermediate and the targeted product could be obtained with high
yields. This type of transformation involving environmentally and
economically friendly synthetic processes is highly advisable from
an industrial point of view and hence resulted in the development
of the one-pot synthetic method.

Chiral secondary alcohols have
emerged as an important structural
motif in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other fine chemical industries,
resulting in greater demand of these fine chemicals.2 Scientists across the world have accelerated the development
of asymmetric catalytic methodologies to synthesize optically active
compounds in a more efficient way. Transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric
transfer hydrogenation (ATH) involving metals like ruthenium, rhodium,
and iridium is one of the highly utilized methods to prepare chiral
secondary alcohols. For this purpose, the chiral N-sulfonylated ethylene
diamine ligand9 in the presence of a metal
is widely used as a chiral source to induce chirality in the prochiral
ketones.

Optically active chiral β-heterosubstituted alcohols,
namely,
β-triazolylethanol and β-hydroxy sulfone, have been found
as a potent pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry.3 In particular, these structures have been found to show
significant antifungal and antimalarial activities. Due to this wide
utility in the field of pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry, various
methods have been used to construct chiral β-triazolylethanol
and β-hydroxy sulfone by researchers. For instance, Hua et al.
reported a pathway via a reductase-catalyzed asymmetric reduction
of azido alkanones, followed by copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
[3 + 2] click cycloaddition to produce optically active triazolylethanol.4

Feringa et al. reported a one-pot cycloaddition
to produce β-triazolylethanol
with excellent enantioselectivity; however, the conversion to the
desired product obtained is <50% in most cases (Scheme 1A,a).5 Optically active β-hydroxy sulfone has been synthesized via
one-pot transformation by Liu et al. (Scheme 1A,b).6 Similarly,
Zhang et al.7 synthesized the β-hydroxy
sulfone via dynamic kinetic resolution employing Noyori’s Ru–TsDPEN
ligand. Recently, we have reported “catalytic asymmetric synthesis
of β-triazolyl amino alcohols by asymmetric transfer hydrogenation
of α-triazolyl amino alkanones” with excellent enantioselectivity
(Scheme 1B).8 In this work, we made use of the N-sulfonylated
diamine ligand9 as a chiral source in the
presence of ruthenium as a metal source. However, the work involved
the preparation of the substrate first, followed by its ATH.

Scheme 1 One-Pot
Synthesis and Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of β-Triazolyl
Amino Ketones
The chiral prolinamide
ligand emerged as an excellent chiral source
to induce chirality in nonchiral compounds. These ligands are widely
used in aldol and Michael reactions.10 In
addition to them, Ru–prolinamide complexes are equally effective
in ATH of prochiral ketone and have shown chiral activity in ATH reactions.11 One of the good features of this catalytic system
is that the system can be fine-tuned by changing the substituent on
the amide. Also, this complex system is inexpensive and easy to prepare
compared with the TsDPEN ligand and shows excellent chiral activity
in aqueous medium. To this end, we tried one-pot cyclization, followed
by ATH in the presence of Ru–prolinamide as a chiral source.
For this purpose, we prepared various amide-substituted chiral prolinamide
ligands and tested them in ATH reactions. Herein, we report one-pot
synthesis of optically active chiral β-heterosubstituted alcohols
via ruthenium–prolinamide-catalyzed ATH with excellent enantioselectivity.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization study was started using 2-bromo-1-phenylethan-1-one
as a model substrate. The model substrate was reacted at 50 °C
with sodium azide, copper sulfate, sodium ascorbate, and phenyl acetylene
in the presence of water/MeOH (1:3) as a solvent, followed by addition
of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, HCOONa,
and L1. Excellent enantioselectivity was obtained with
poor conversion of the starting substrate (Table 1, entry 1). Similar conversion and enantioselectivity
were observed when L2 was used as a chiral source (Table 1, entry 2). However,
considerable drop in conversion and % ee was observed with L3 (Table 1, entry 3)
and even poorer with L4 and L5 (Table 1, entries 4 and 5).
This may be due to the functional group present on the amide part
interfering with the stereodetermining transition state, resulting
in lowering of % ee. Interestingly, amide substituted with the 2,6-diisopropyl
substituent produced good % ee and conversion (Table 1, entry 6). Hence, ligand L6 was selected for further optimization studies. To optimize the solvent,
first, ATH was tried only in water, with full conversion of reactant
to intermediate ketone and only 33% of intermediate converted to the
product with good enantiomeric excess (Table 2, entry 1). To increase the solubility of
intermediate ketone, a cosolvent was introduced in the reaction mixture.
The water–MeOH (1:2) system improved product formation up to
50% with full conversion of intermediate and 50% of the starting material
remaining unreacted (Table 2, entry 2).

formate (1.5 mmol) and stirred at 50 °C for 24 h.

a Conditions: To 1a (0.5
mmol), phenyl acetylene (0.5 mmol), and sodium azide (1.5 mmol) in
the given solvent were added copper sulfate (10 mmol %) and sodium
ascorbate (0.05 mmol), followed by [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (2.5 mmol %), L6 (5 mmol %), and
sodium formate (1.5 mmol) and stirred at a given time and temperature.

b The conversions and ee’s
were for the chiral product determined by chiral HPLC.

Other cosolvent systems like water–isopropyl
alcohol (IPA)
(1:3) and water–t-BuOH gave similar results
in terms of conversion and ee (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). Of these, water–IPA (1:3)
gave a slightly better result; thus, we tried a reaction in IPA only,
and 8% of conversion was obtained with poor selectivity (Table 2, entry 5). The conversion
of reactant and intermediate was increased in the water–IPA
(1:2) solvent system, producing 72% of the product with 90% enantioselectivity
(Table 2, entry 6).
Even more conversion was obtained when equal amount of water and IPA
was introduced in the reaction with an ee of 92% (Table 2, entry 7). Next, we turned
our attention to the reaction temperature. By increasing the reaction
temperature to 60 °C, full conversion was obtained with no loss
in enantioselectivity (Table 2, entry 8). Traces of product were obtained at room temperature
(rt) with full conversion into the intermediate (Table 2, entry 9). The product formation
was not affected when the reaction time was reduced to 6 h, though
poorer conversions were obtained when time was further reduced to
3 h (Table 2, entries
10 and 12). Traces of reactant were converted into product in the
absence of sodium formate (Table 2, entry 13).

A kinetic study of this one-pot
transformation was carried out
to get more insight into the reaction. The reaction can proceed via
two reaction pathways as shown in Figure 1. The first path follows a click cycloaddition
to get the intermediate B followed by ATH to produce
the desired product D. The other pathway proceeds first
with ATH to produce intermediate C, followed by click
cycloaddition to get chiral product D. As shown in Figure 1, starting material A get consumed rapidly within first 40 min. With the decrease
of A, the intermediate B forms rapidly with
a gradual formation of the desired product D. After first
hour, there is a linear decrease of intermediate B with
linear formation of product D. On the other hand, the
intermediate C of other pathway remains constant throughout
the reaction, which indicates that the reaction follows the path with
first click cycloaddition followed by ATH. The intermediate B was isolated at the start of the reaction, and NMR is given
in Supporting Information.

transformation into β-triazolylethanol
(A–D).

With the optimized condition
in hand, substrate scope for one-pot
synthesis was investigated using a range of α-bromo ketones
and substituted phenyl acetylenes, and the results are summarized
in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Substrate
Study
Conditions: To 1a–j (0.5 mmol), substituted phenyl acetylene (0.5
mmol) and sodium azide (1.5 mmol) in water/IPA (1:1) were added copper
sulfate (10 mmol %) and sodium ascorbate (0.05 mmol), followed by
[RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (2.5 mmol
%) and L6 (5 mmol %) at 60 °C and stirred for 6
h. The yields are isolated yields, and ee’s were for the chiral
product determined by chiral HPLC.

The compounds
with electron-donating substituents (1a, 1b, and 1c) converted into products 2a, 2b, and 2c, respectively, with
excellent % ee. We did not find the effect of the electron-withdrawing
substituent at the para or meta position as substrates 1d and 1e with fluoro and chloro substituents at para
and meta positions, respectively, furnished products 2d and 2e with slightly better ee’s than 2a and 2b. Similarly, substrates 1f and 1g with the naphthyl system converted to corresponding
products 2f and 2g with 95.3 and 93.3% ee’s,
respectively. The different substitution pattern on the phenyl acetylene
part did not show any substantial effect on % ee because the chiral
products 2h (93.6%), 2i (93.8%), and 2j (90.6%) were obtained with great enantioselectivity. We
have also screened other α-halogenated ketones such as 2-chloro-1-phenylethan-1-one
(1i), and only 4% of product was formed.

Furthermore,
one-pot synthesis of chiral β-hydroxy sulfone
was carried by employing this methodology. A variety of α-bromoacetophenones
were reacted with substituted aryl sulfonic acid, and results are
summarized in Scheme 3. The electron-donating substituent at the para position produced
the chiral product with excellent enantiomeric excess, and 3a, 3b, and 3c were obtained with >96%
ee
in all cases. The methoxy substituent at the meta position (3d) produced even higher enantioselectivity compared with
the para substituent. Similarly, electron-withdrawing fluoro and bromo
groups showed similar enantioselectivities, and products 3e and 3f formed with 97.5 and 93.6% ee’s, respectively,
with a slightly higher yield compared to that in the earlier class
of compounds. The naphthyl substrate produced the corresponding chiral
products 3g and 3h with 97.6 and 96.6% ee’s,
respectively. Similarly, the heteroaromatic substrate converted into
chiral products with high enantiomeric excess, with 3i and 3j forming with 93.9 and 94.9% ee, respectively.
Similar to the earlier case, α-chloro ketone was unable to convert
into the product and only 6% of compound was observed.

Scheme 3 One-Pot
Synthesis of β-Hydroxy Sulfone
Conditions:
To substituted 2-bromo
ketone (0.5 mmol) and sodium benzenesulfinate (0.5 mmol) in water/IPA
(1:1) were added [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (2.5 mmol %) and L6 (5 mmol %) at 60 °C
and stirred for 6 h. The yields are isolated yields and ee was for
the chiral product determined by chiral HPLC.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a one-pot route to synthesize optically
active β-triazolylethanol and β-hydroxy sulfone derivatives
via ruthenium-catalyzed ATH of corresponding intermediate ketones.
A variety of Ru–prolinamide ligands were screened, and one
with the isopropyl group situated at the ortho position produced desired
results. The optically active compounds were synthesized in aqueous
medium with enantiomeric excess comparable to that of the earlier
reported Noyori’s catalyst.

Experimental Section
General
Materials and Methods
[Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 was commercially purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All reactions were carried out
under a nitrogen atmosphere, unless otherwise stated, and at the temperature
specified in experimental procedures. Yields refer to isolated yields.
All other chemicals and solvents were purchased from different sources
and used as received without further purification. Melting points
were recorded using an Analab melting point apparatus by the open
capillary method. 1H NMR and 13C NMR (distortionless
enhancement by polarization transfer) spectra were recorded at 24
°C in CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide on 400, 500, 101,
and 126 MHz instrument, respectively, with tetramethylsilane as the
internal standard in the case of CDCl3. Enantiomeric excess
was determined by HPLC analysis using a chiral column described below
in detail. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (100–200
mesh). The progress of reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
analysis.

Synthesis of Chiral Ligands
Step I
A solution
of Boc-protected proline (14 mmol)
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (25 mL) and Et3N (14 mmol) was
cooled to 0 °C. Ethyl chloroformate (14 mmol) was added dropwise
over 15 min, and the resulting white mixture was stirred at 0 °C
for 30 min. A solution of substituted amines (14 mmol) in THF (10
mL) was added over 10 min at 0 °C. The reaction was stirred at
rt overnight, and then the mixture was washed with ethyl acetate.
The combined organic layers were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. To the crude
product dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (10 mL) at rt was added
trifluoroacetic acid (100 mmol). The solution was stirred at rt for
1 h, and upon completion, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.
The residue was dissolved in DCM (10 mL), and water (6 mL) was added.
The mixture was neutralized with solid Na2CO3 until pH ∼ 9, and then it was extracted with DCM (3 ×
15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation to afford amino
amide (65–73% yield) as a solid, which was directly used in
DKR–ATH.11d

Experimental
Procedure for the One-Pot Synthesis of β-Hydroxy
Sulfones (3a–j)
α-Bromoketone
(0.5 mmol), 0.55 mmol of sodium benzene sulfinate, 2.5 mmol % [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2, 5 mmol % L6, 1.5 mmol of HCOONa, and 10 mL of H2O/IPA (1:1, v/v)
at 60 °C for 6 h. After completion of the reaction, 5 mL of water
was added to the mixture, which was extracted by ethyl acetate (3
× 5.0 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine twice
and dehydrated with anhydrous Na2SO4. After
the evaporation of ethyl acetate, the residue was purified by silica
gel column chromatography.
