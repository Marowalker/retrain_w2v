Moth-eye-inspired
nanostructures are highly useful for antireflection
applications. However, block copolymer micelle lithography, an effective
method to prepare moth eye nanopillars, can only be used on a limited
choice of substrates. Another drawback of nanopillar substrates is
that contamination is easily absorbed, thereby reducing transmittance.
The production of antireflective surfaces that are contamination-resistant
or that can be cleaned easily without the loss of optical properties
remains challenging. Here, we describe an approach for creating inverse
moth eye nanostructures on other optical substrates than the most
commonly used fused silica. We demonstrate its feasibility by fabricating
a borosilicate substrate with inverse nanostructures on both sides.
The etching of nanoholes on both sides of the substrate improves its
transmittance by 8%, thereby surpassing the highest increase of transmittance
yet to be obtained with nanopillars on fused silica. More importantly,
the substrate with inverse moth eye nanostructures is more robust
against contaminations than the substrates with nanopillars. No significant
decrease in performance is observed after five cycles of repeated
contamination and cleaning. Our approach is transferable to a variety
of optical materials, rendering our antireflection nanostructures
ideal for applications in touch devices such as touch screens and
display panels.

Introduction
Various concepts and techniques have been
developed to overcome
Fresnel reflection at the interface of materials with different refractive
indices, among them moth-eye-inspired nanostructures with a gradient
refractive index that can eliminate Fresnel reflection for omnidirectional
incidence over a broad wavelength range.1−4 Electron-beam lithography and interference
lithography have been used in the past to fabricate such nanostructures.
These methods, however, are unattractive because of their high cost
and/or limited resolution.

More recently, block copolymer micelle
lithography (BCML) and reactive
ion dry etching have been used to prepare moth eye nanostructures
on fused silica to achieve perfect transmission and zero reflection.5,6 Unfortunately, the transferability of this method to other substrates
is limited because the choice of the masking material for the BCML
etching mask is restricted to gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.7−10 This constitutes a problem because the selectivity of the etching
process when, for instance, using gold or silver nanoparticles as
the masking material is not sufficient to etch moth eye nanopillars
into most types of suitable substrates. Therefore, the production
of most kinds of optical glasses or materials with differing refractive
indices or other desired optical properties entails costly, high-performance
antireflection treatment. Moreover, nanopillars on the fused silica
substrate, though relatively robust to mechanical damage, are very
sensitive to contaminations through contact, such as fingerprints,
and they are difficult to be cleaned.11 Therefore, there exists a high demand to develop a new method to
prepare antireflection nanostructures on a broader range of different
types of optical materials. To this day, antireflection properties
in combination with contamination resistance or easy clean ability
remain far behind application requirements.

Inverse moth eye
nanostructures, also called nanoholes, have been
investigated regarding their antireflection, antimicrobial, and/or
high damage tolerance properties.11,12 Generally,
these studies have concluded the greatest limitations of nanoholes
to be the highly elaborate fabrication steps necessary for their production
or their poor optical performance.13−18 In this work, we developed a new method to convert a gold nanoparticle
etching mask produced by BCML into an inverse chromium etching mask.
This mask is used to etch semihexagonal nanoholes onto both sides
of a borosilicate substrate. Nanoholes are expected to offer antireflection
properties similar to those of nanopillars. Because of their geometry
and high mechanical stability, they are also likely to have improved
contamination resistance and to be easier to clean.19

Results and Discussion
A schematic illustration of
the process for realizing inverse moth
eye nanoholes as well as the matching atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images is shown in Figure 1. A quasihexagonal
pattern of gold nanoparticles is prepared by BCML on both sides of
a borosilicate substrate. The interparticle distance is chosen to
be 105.0 ± 12.0 nm, and the nanoparticles have a diameter of
7.0 ± 0.2 nm. The same parameters are also used for the nanopillars
which will be discussed in this work. First, the diameter of the gold
nanoparticles is increased to 20.5 ± 0.8 nm through an electroless
deposition step. The growth of the gold nanoparticles is important
to achieve ideal chromium coverage as this will later facilitate the
removal of the gold particles. After the growth of the particles,
a 5 nm chromium layer is sputtered onto the substrate. The thickness
of the chromium layer is chosen such that chromium covers only the
surface between the gold nanoparticles and the top of the gold particles.
The sides of the gold particles remain uncovered. Immersion in piranha
solution (H2O2 30% to H2SO4 98%, volume ratio 1:3) for two cycles of 5 min each removes the
gold nanoparticles from the surface, leaving the chromium layer with
holes where the gold particles were located before. As shown in Figure 1d,e, the chromium
layer between the holes has an average thickness of 5 nm. Nanoholes
with 200 nm depth are then etched into the borosilicate substrate
using a reactive ion etching (RIE) machine. Finally, the chromium
layer is removed using a chromium etcher.

and nanopillar substrates. (a) Diagram

5.5 ± 0.4 nm, and the distance between the holes in the chromium

Our new method successfully converts
the gold nanoparticle etching
mask into an etching mask of another material (chromium in this case),
which features the inverse pattern. The dry etching selectivity of
chromium to borosilicate glass is much higher than that of gold to
borosilicate. Thus, the 5 nm chromium layer is very thick to allow
the etching of nanoholes with a depth of 200 nm. Other materials that
cannot be etched using a gold nanoparticle etching mask may also be
suitable for this method. Figure 2 shows SEM images of the nanoholes. These holes differ
from the nanopillars we published in an earlier work in two major
ways.6 Compared to the previously described
nanopillars, the sidewall of the nanoholes is more slanted. The borosilicate
glass contains silicon dioxide (60–70%) and different weight
contributions of Al2O3, B2O3, K2O, and Na2O.20 These components have a high chemical resistance and a very low
thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, they make borosilicate
glass more resilient to be etched than fused silica. The top-view
diameter of the nanoholes differs from the diameter of the nanopillars
made using the original gold nanoparticle etching mask (Figure 2b). This is related to the
fact that the thickness of the chromium layer is the thinnest at the
edge of each hole and gets thicker as it is further from the edge.
The thinner the chromium layer is, the faster it is etched away. Thus,
the thin layer of chromium surrounding the holes’ edges causes
the nanoholes to have an inverted cone shape (wider top and narrower
bottom). Fortunately, these two differences (larger circumference
and cone shape) between the nanopillars and the nanoholes do not interfere
with the antireflective properties of the nanostructured surface,
as the gradient refractive index change from the surrounding air to
the glass is not affected.

glass substrate. (a)

We used our new nanohole etching
method to prepare nanoholes on
both sides of a borosilicate substrate. The transmittance and reflectance
of this substrate were then compared to a borosilicate substrate structured
with nanopillar-like structures on both substrate sides (using the
original gold nanoparticle etching mask) as well as a borosilicate
reference substrate without nanostructures. The first two were etched
using the inverse chromium etching mask (to produce nanoholes) or
the original gold dot etching mask (to produce nanopillars) over an
identical number of cycles in a RIE machine (details described in Experimental Section or Computational Methods).
The 200 nm sized nanoholes on the structured surfaces produce a gradient
refractive index change from the air to the substrate. The maximum
transmittance is 98.9% at a wavelength of 490 nm. Our attempts to
etch nanopillars into the borosilicate substrate using the gold particle
mask were unsuccessful because of the different components in the
borosilicate glass. These components possess a low etching selectivity
compared to the gold dot etching mask. Thus, the gold dots are etched
away at the beginning of the etching process, resulting in pillarlike
random nanostructures with limited height (less than 120 nm in height)
on the surface. Shown as the red curve in Figure 3a, the transmittance of this substrate is
only 2 to 3% higher than that of the unstructured control substrate.
Because of the limited height of the nanopillars, transmittance reaches
a limited maximum at a short wavelength of 395 nm. Figure 3b shows the reflectance of
the substrates. Much like the transmittance, the minimum reflectance
of the nanohole substrate (0.3% at 460 nm) is also lower than that
of the nanopillar substrate. Figure 3c shows the transmittance and reflectance of the nanohole
substrate at different angles of incidence. At angles of incidence
up to 30°, the nanohole substrate has good antireflection properties.
At angles of incidence exceeding 30°, the reflectance increases
significantly. This also agrees well with calculation results, as
shown in the black triangle in Figure 3c.

substrate
with nanoholes or nanopillars on both sides. (a,b) Comparison of the
transmittance and reflectance (300–950 nm) of a borosilicate
glass substrate with 200 nm nanoholes on both sides (in blue), a borosilicate
glass substrate with 120 nm nanopillars on both sides (in red), and
the reference sample without nanostructures (in black). The calculated
transmittance and reflectance of the substrate with 200 nm nanoholes
are in dashed red and blue curves. Parameters of nanoholes in calculation: h = 200 nm, d = 105 nm, a = 90 nm, b = 80 nm, ha = hb = 30 nm, and hc = 140
nm. (c) Measured average (380–500 nm) transmittance (red circles),
reflectance (blue triangles), and calculated reflectance (black triangles)
of the borosilicate glass substrates with 200 nm nanoholes on both
sides shown in (a,b) measured at different angles of incidence.

A comparison of the optical properties
of the borosilicate nanohole
substrate and a fused silica nanopillar substrate (produced as described
in a previous publication6) shows that
the maximum transmittance of the nanohole substrate (98.9%) is lower
than that of the nanopillar substrate (pillar spacing 105 nm, height
450 nm, and maximum transmittance 99.8%). However, the absolute improvement
in transmittance (compared to a nonstructured substrate) for the nanohole
substrate (8% at its maximum, from 90.9 to 98.9% for a borosilicate
substrate) is much higher than that of the nanopillar substrate (6.8%
at its maximum, from 93 to 99.8% for a fused silica substrate). This
demonstrates that this new method to prepare nanoholes represents
an improvement. On the basis of the result of the calculation, as
shown in the dashed blue curves in Figure 3a,b, the antireflection property of these
nanoholes can be further optimized. It can be expected that optimizing
the geometry and/or reducing the surface roughness of the holes will
further improve the transmittance of the nanohole substrate.

Despite their outstanding antireflection properties, moth-eye-inspired
nanostructures have two main disadvantages. The first is their high
preparation cost because of elaborate fabrication procedures. This
restriction can be solved by utilizing BCML for the production of
the nanopillars or nanoholes. Second, these nanostructures are easily
contaminated during experimental handling. Furthermore, an efficient
method to clean these substrates and to restore their antireflection
function has not yet been reported and would represent a breakthrough
improvement for practical applications. On the basis of their geometry,
we expect nanoholes to be more resistant to contaminations and more
robust during cleaning than the nanopillars.21 To look at this in greater details, we compared the tolerance of
the nanopillars and nanoholes to surface cleaning. Many types of contaminations
exist. Here, we focused on the effect of fingerprint contacts. We
compared the effect of multiple fingerprint contaminations and cleaning
steps on a fused silica SUPRASIL substrate featuring 200 nm high nanopillars
on both sides and a borosilicate glass substrate with 200 nm deep
nanoholes on both sides. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the transmittance of both substrates
decreases strongly after fingerprint contamination (dashed gray curves).
This is a 15% decrease compared to transmittance before the contamination.
Next, we cleaned both substrates following an identical protocol using
Hellmanex solution. We repeated this combination of fingerprint contamination
and cleaning steps up to five times. Transmittance measurement after
five rounds of contamination and cleaning revealed two effects (see Figure 4a): the maximum transmittance
of the nanopillar substrate shifts toward a longer wavelength range
and it decreases by more than 1.5%. In comparison, the transmittance
of the nanohole substrate—with a maximum decrease of less than
0.2%—remains almost unchanged after five rounds of contamination
and cleaning. This proves that the nanoholes’ antireflection
properties are more robust against repeated contamination and cleaning
than the nanopillars’ transmittance. To understand the mechanism
of the contamination and cleaning process, we check the substrate
with 200 nanopillars by a scanning electron microscope. As shown in Figure 4c, the nanopillars
have a round tip and a homogeneous height before the contamination
and cleaning steps. After five cycles of contamination, as shown in Figure 4d, the tips of the
nanopillars are damaged or distorted with some residual contamination
on top. On the basis of the SEM image of the side view, most of the
nanopillars have flat top surface. During these cycles, some of the
nanopillars are broken at different heights with an increasing variation
of pillar height. All these key differences before and after cleaning
are considered in the simulation shown in Figure 4e. The maximum transmittance of the nanopillar
after cleaning (purple dashed curve) shifts toward a longer wavelength
range, and it decreases by more than 2.5%. However, as shown in Figure 4f,g, the shape of
the nanoholes is almost not changed during the same treatment. The
geometry of the nanopillars is much more sensitive to the contamination
and cleaning processes than that of the nanoholes. It can be concluded
that the nanoholes are better suited for antireflection interfaces
that need to be contamination-resistant or easy for cleaning.

Conclusions
We have developed a new method to prepare inverse
moth eye structures
on materials other than fused silica. An increase of transmission
of more than 8% is observed on a borosilicate glass substrate with
nanoholes on both sides. New possibilities for transferring the method
to other materials have emerged through expanding the original BCML
nanolithography method based on a gold nanoparticle etching mask to
include a second inverse chromium mask after electroless deposition.
Possible materials include optical glass with a high refractive index
and optical materials that cannot be etched with a gold etching mask.
An additional advantage is the possibility to clean these nanohole
substrates multiple times without significantly damaging their antireflection
properties. We believe that this novel method will open new doors
for preparing moth eye/inverse moth eye nanostructures on a wide range
of previously unusable optical materials. Our technique creates new
possibilities for applications that require high contamination resistance
and/or must be easy to clean.

Experimental Section or Computational Methods
BCML was employed to create a hexagonal pattern of gold nanoparticles
on the fused silica or borosilicate substrates. Polystyrene-block-2-vinylpyridine or PS-b-P2VP (Mn (PS) = 110 000, Mn (PVP) = 70 500, Mw/Mn = 1.09, Polymer Source Inc.) copolymers were
dissolved in o-xylene at a concentration of 4 mg/mL
and stirred for 24 h to form micelles. Gold salt (HAuCl4·3H2O, MW = 393.83 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich) was added
with a loading rate (L) of 0.25. The substrates were
spin-coated at 7000 rpm for 60 s to create the hexagonal pattern.
The gold nanoparticles were grown by electroless deposition. First,
the substrates were activated by hydrogen plasma treatment (3 min,
0.4 mbar, and 200 W) using a PVA TePla 1000 microwave system. The
activated substrates were dipped into a solution of 0.1% HAuCl4/0.4 mM HN3OHCl for 30 s. The polymer shell was
then removed by a second hydrogen plasma treatment (10 min, 0.4 mbar,
and 350 W). The hexagonal gold nanoparticle pattern on a fused silica
substrate was used as an etching mask for the RIE of nanopillars.

The hexagonal gold nanoparticle array on a borosilicate substrate
was further used to create an inverse chromium etching mask for the
production of a hexagonally arranged nanohole pattern. To this end,
a GLAD system (homebuilt e-beam evaporator) was used (10 kV, 15 mA,
1.5 × 10–6 mbar) to sputter a 5 nm thick layer
of chromium with a sputter rate of 0.3 Å/s onto the hexagonal
gold nanoparticle array. Prior to RIE, the gold nanoparticles were
removed by immersing the substrates in freshly prepared piranha solution
(consisting of 1 part 30% p.a. hydrogen peroxide solution and 3 parts
98% sulfuric acid) for 5 min and subsequent rinsing with ultrapure
water. An Oxford PlasmaLab 80 RIE etcher was used to etch the hexagonal
nanohole pattern into the borosilicate substrate. Two different etching
steps were used to control the geometry and refractive index profile
of the nanopillars. The first etching step consisted of two treatments:
first with a 1:1 mixture of Ar and SF6 [80 sccm, 50 mTorr,
radio frequency (rf) power 120 W, 60 s] and followed by a treatment
with a 1:1 mixture of Ar and CHF3 (80 sccm, 50 mTorr, rf
power 120 W, ICP power 20 W, 20 s). The second etching step consisted
of a single treatment with a 1:1 mixture of Ar and SF6 (80
sccm, 50 mTorr, rf power 120 W, 80 s). Different cycles of these two
steps were carefully combined until the desired structure depth was
reached. The temperature of the sample was kept constant at 20 °C
during the entire process.

A Cary 5000 Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared
spectrometer
was used to measure the transmittance and reflectance (175–3300
nm) for comparing the borosilicate nanohole substrate, the fused silica
nanopillar substrate, and the unstructured reference substrate. A
specially designed OMT goniometer was used to determine the angle
of incidence (380–1100 nm, transmittance 0–60°,
reflectance 8–60°).

Fingerprints were applied on
both sides of the substrate (with
nanoholes or nanopillars) with pressure. Afterward, the contaminated
samples were immersed into a 30 °C preheated Hellmanex III solution
(Hellma Analytics, Müllheim, Germany) for 15 min. Then, the
samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried in a
nitrogen stream. This procedure was repeated several cycles to test
the long-term durability. After each contamination and cleaning step,
the transmittance was measured.

An array of 100 nanoholes or
nanopillars with the hole depth or
pillar heights following a normal distribution was considered as a
unit for the simulation. The filling factor in the unit was calculated
layer-by-layer along the hole depth or pillar height in steps of 1
nm. The reflectance and transmittance were simulated by MATLAB (R2016a,
MathWorks) based on the open-source thin-film toolbox developed by
Griesmann (U. Griesmann, “Thin film tool box-Ulf’s Cyber
Attic”). Parameters of the nanopillars used in calculation
for Figure 4e: Before
contamination, height = 200 nm × (1 ± 5%), interpillar spacing
= 105 nm, bottom width = 90 nm, middle width = 65 nm, height bottom/height
= height top/height = 25%, and height middle/height = 50%. After five
cycles of contamination, height = 150 nm × (1 ± 50%), interpillar
spacing = 105 nm, bottom width = 90 nm, middle width = 65 nm, height
bottom/height = 25%, and height middle/height = 75%.
