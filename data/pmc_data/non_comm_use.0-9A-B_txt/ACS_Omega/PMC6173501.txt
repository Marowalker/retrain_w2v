A unique
method has been developed for comparative analysis of
H2S produced from food samples from our daily diet, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. The selective detection of H2S has been executed by introducing a simple chemodosimeter
(PN-N3) that gives response on
the basis of intramolecular charge transfer. UV–vis, fluorimetric,
and NMR titrations were performed to demonstrate the sensing mechanism
and electronic environment of PN-N3 in the presence of H2S. Density functional theory
calculations were performed to validate the mechanism of azide (PN-N3) reduction to amine (PN-NH2) by the strong reducing power of H2S. The potentiality of this chemosensing method is that it
could be treated as a simple, less-time-consuming, and cost-effective
method for determining H2S in biological samples in the
nanomolar range.

Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas is though traditionally recalled
with its unique obnoxious foul smell of rotten eggs,1,2 but nowadays it is in the limelight of scientific research field
for its role as third endogenous gasotransmitter, after carbon monoxide
(CO) and nitric oxide (NO).3−7 In a mammalian system, H2S is endogenously produced from
cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) in a series of reactions mainly
catalyzed by several enzymes: two pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)8 and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE),9 as well as cysteineaminotransferase (CAT) and mercaptopyruvatesulfurtransferase
(MST).10,11 Some sulfate-reducing bacteria, present
in both the mouth and intestinal tract,12 can oxidize organic compounds or molecular hydrogen while reducing
SO42– to H2S. The biological
concentration level of H2S in blood plasma is 10–100
μM, whereas in the central nervous system, it is found to be
in the range of 50–160 μM.13,14 A number of
pathological and physiological15−18 processes, especially modulation of gastrointestinal,
endocrine, and genitourinary systems19−23 and neuromodulation,24−26 possess direct involvement
of H2S. Besides these, H2S can also act as a
channel opener of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive
potassium channels (KATP) and some other potassium channels27,28 and as an antioxidant or scavenger toward reactive oxygen species
(ROS).29 Numerous diseases show correlation
with the abnormal level of H2S regulation in the mammalian
body system.30−33

Along with this entire beneficial role, H2S, if
present
in higher concentration, can also be deadly harmful for the biological
system by inducing shock, coma, and convulsion.34 Due to the power of reducibility and high solubility
in lipids even at low concentration,35 H2S may prevent cellular respiration through complexation with
cytochromes, which eventually leads to death.36 It is found that the β cells of pancreas in type 1 diabetes37 and human body inherited with trisomy 21 (Down’s
syndrome)38 produces an excess of this
gas. The manifestation of both advantageous and adverse effects of
H2S undoubtedly demands that certain biological concentration
level of this gas must be maintained in our body.

To the best
of our knowledge, the quantitative estimation of H2S from
food samples using the chemodosimetric method has not
been studied so far, even though one of the main sources from which
endogenous H2S is produced is food what we consume daily
(comparison table, Table S1). Our research
group has developed a unique method to monitor the comparative concentration
of H2S in our daily diet. In this method, a new chemodosimetric
probe, pyridine–naphthalimide conjugated azide (PN-N3), has been introduced to detect the gas
very promptly through the fluorescence “turn-on” mechanism.
Several traditional analytical methods, such as electrochemical methods,39−42 gas chromatography,43−45 colorimetric assay,46−48 and metal-induced sulfide
precipitation49,50 have been used for detection
of H2S. However, we took interest in chemosensors due to
their high sensitivity, high quantum yield (QY, Φ), selectivity,
and specificity toward the guest, and more significantly these probes
are of low cost,51−55 portable and able to sense the target molecules in very less time.
For designing the probes to detect H2S, the azide–H2S reaction chemistry is predominantly explored.56−60 Keeping in mind this mechanism, PN-N3 was synthesized with 86% yield through three simple steps
of reactions starting from 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride. The PN-N3 structure was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral studies (Figures S1–S5, Supporting information).

Results
and Discussion
Spectral Behavior of PN-N3 with H2S
Absorbance and fluorescence
titration spectra of PN-N3 with
H2S up to 20
equiv were recorded in CH3CN/H2O (1:8, v/v;
pH 7.0; 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline). From Figure 1a, it has been observed that during successive
addition of H2S, absorbance at 370 nm has been decreased
along with an increase at 435 nm. Two clear isosbestic points at 293
and 401 nm support the formation of a new compound in the reaction
between PN-N3 and H2S. A bathochromic shift of about 65 nm (370 → 435 nm) in absorbance
spectra describes the nucleophilic addition of H2S to the
azide moiety, which produces highly fluorescent PN-NH2 by blocking the intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) process. About 3-fold enhanced absorbance of PN-NH2 compared to that of PN-N3 has been noted at 435 nm upon saturation with
H2S (Figure S6). Fluorimetric
titration reveals that a 20 μM solution of PN-N3 is weakly fluorescent (Φ = 0.056)
but an addition of 20 equiv H2S hiked up to 5-fold (Φ*
= 0.314) turn-on response. A slight red shift from 517 to 524 nm (λmax = 435 nm) (Figure 1b) is probably due to the vibrant n−π* transition
in the naphthalimide moiety of PN-NH2.

pH titration shows that PN-N3 is independent of the pH of the solution, whereas PN-NH2 becomes nonfluorescent under
acidic pH
due to protonation of the −NH2 group (Figure S7). The detection limit of PN-N3 for H2S was measured to be 66
nM (Figure S8). Job’s plot analysis
indicated 1:2 stoichiometric interaction of PN-N3 with H2S to give PN-NH2 (Figure S9).
The kinetic profiles showed the completion of the reaction between PN-N3 and H2S within 90
s (Figure 1c). The
pseudo-first-order rate constant (k′) has
been calculated as k′ = 0.02 s–1 (Figure 1d) according
to the equation61 1  where Ft and Fmax are the fluorescence intensities at 524
nm (λex = 435 nm) at time “t” and the maximum value obtained after the reaction is complete,
respectively, and k′ is the observed pseudo-first-order
rate constant.

Selectivity of PN-N3
Before
moving to other relevant experiments, we checked the selectivity of PN-N3 toward H2S. The addition
of various anions (HPO42–, HCO3–, OAc–, F–, Cl–, S2O3–, S2O42–, SO32–, SO42–) and biologically
relevant ROS, RNS such as H2O2 and NO, along
with ascorbic acid and l-cysteine, to the colorless solution
of PN-N3 did not show any changes,
whereas the addition of H2S turned immediately the colorless
clear solution into lemon yellow. A strong green fluorescence has
been shown for H2S when a similar test was performed under
a UV lamp, but in the presence of other anions, ROS, RNS, and l-cysteine, the solution endured its inherent non-fluorescence
(Figure S10a). Sensitivity of PN-N3 toward H2S in the gas phase
was well accomplished by the dip stick method. The paper strips were
soaked in the probe solution and exhibited bright lemon yellow color
just after contacting with H2S (Figure S10b). This observation was also justified by absorbance and
fluorescence titration studies (Figure S11).

NMR and Mass Titration
1H NMR titration
was executed in CD3CN (Figure S12) to illustrate the interactions of PN-N3 with H2S. After the gradual addition of H2S to the probe, a new characteristic peak of the aromatic amine functional
group was developed between 5.0 and 5.2 ppm. The conversion of azide
to amine in the presence of 2 equiv of H2S made PN-NH2 more electron-rich and consequently the
entire aromatic region shifted to upfield a little bit. The mass spectrum
of the reaction mixture of PN-N3 and H2S has also been recorded, which gives a new peak
at m/z: 317.2134, specifying the
formation of PN-NH2 (Figure S13).

Theoretical Analysis
We performed time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for the reactant and the product
also (Figure S14). The investigation was
done by quantum chemical calculations at the DFT level using the 6-311G+(d,p)
basis set implemented in Gaussian 09 program. Solvent effects were
incorporated using a CPCM solvent model (Tables S2 and S3).

The vertical electronic transitions, i.e.,
the calculated λmax, orbital transition, and oscillator
strength (f), are listed in Tables S4, S5 and Figure S15. Provided transitions at 285 nm in PN-N3, 288 nm and 408 nm in PN-NH2 indicate the formation of two
prominent isosbestic points in absorbance titration. The major transition
in PN-N3 at 376 nm (S0 → S1, f = 0.8193) is very close
to that observed at 370 nm experimentally. Lowering of the curve in
titration signifies the termination of ICT. Furthermore, the energy
gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PN-N3 is smaller than that of PN-NH2, in good agreement with the greater stability of the
latter (Figure 2).
This theoretical study strongly correlates with the experimental findings.

distributions of PN-N3 and PN-NH2.

Potential Energy Surface (PES) Calculation
We also
acquired the energies of different probable intermediates from potential
energy surface (PES) calculations (Figure 3).62

Figure 3 Calculated
potential energy surfaces for the plausible mechanism
of formation of PN-NH2 from PN-N3. Energies are reported in kcal/mol.

The highest energy (17.5 kcal/mol)
occupying intermediate 2 has been achieved after
the nucleophilic attack on PN-N3 by the hydrosulfide (HS–) ion. Then, the thermodynamically
most stable (−70.3
kcal/mol) product PN-NH2 is formed
via anionic intermediate 3.

Plausible Mechanism and
Explanation
From all of the
experimental and computational investigations outlined above, a plausible
mechanism for HS–-mediated reduction of PN-N3 (Scheme 1) has been defined. On the basis of the high nucleophilicity
of HS– (obtained from aq Na2S solution),
it may be the active species required for azide reduction, rather
than H2S.

Scheme 1 Fluorescence Turn-On of PN-N3 after Addition of H2S
PN-N3 is weakly fluorescent,
signifying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the pyridine
to the naphthalimide moiety. In the first step of this reaction (Scheme S1), a nucleophilic attack of HS– occurs on the electrophilic center, i.e., the azide nitrogen of PN-N3, to produce anionic azidothiol
intermediate 1, which is then rapidly protonated to form
more electrophilic and neutral intermediate 2, ensuing
the closure of ICT. Consequent attack of second equivalent of HS– on 2 produces deprotonated resonance-stabilized
amine 3, which benefits a sharp n−π* transition
in the naphthalimide moiety. Finally, the proton transfer facilitated
by the solvent water results in the formation of strong fluorescent PN-NH2.

Quantitative Analysis
For comparative studies on the
consumption of H2S in human body through nutrients, food
samples were arbitrarily chosen from our daily diet, such as chicken,
egg, fish, radish, soybean, and cauliflower.63,64 All of the samples except egg had been washed, cut into pieces,
and set to boil in distilled water. In case of eggs, egg white was
separated and boiled. The vapor produced from the food sample was
allowed to come in contact of filter paper strips coated with our
probe PN-N3 (Figure 4). The colorimetric changes
in the strips were observed and recorded during 2 h with 30 min time
interval.

Figure 4 Apparatus setup for analysis of H2S produced from dietary
samples.

The concentration of H2S produced from the chosen food
samples was estimated on the basis of fluorimetric analysis. The difference
between the fluorescence intensities of the paper strips at different
time intervals could give a clear idea about whether the food samples
can provide a higher, moderate, or lower amount of H2S
after its consumption by the living system (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 (a) Images of filter paper strips after consumption
of H2S vapor produced from food samples at 30 min interval.
(b) Estimation
of the concentration of H2S produced from the food samples
following the standard curve. Standard deviations (SDs) are given
by error bars, where n = 3.

Three paper strips soaked with PN-N3 were allowed to keep contact with the exposure in
commercially
available Na2S solutions to display the different fluorescence
intensities, indicating three different ranges of concentrations (Figure S16). Hence, a standard curve was obtained
by plotting the fluorescence intensity of PN-N3 with Na2S with the respective concentration
of H2S evolved (Figure 5b). This concentration versus fluorescence intensity
graph could easily represent the amount of H2S produced
from the food samples after their consumption by the living system,
and here it was found to be in the range of 0.5–1.4 μM.
A colorimetric assay has also been carried out with the help of the
absorbance plot to further validate the fluorimetric estimation data
(Figure S17).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully developed a new chemosensing method
for comparative quantitative analysis of H2S produced by
food samples from our daily diet. The chemodosimeter PN-N3 can selectively detect H2S at
nanomolar range giving a vivid colorimetric and fluorimetric response
in both solution and gaseous phases. The potentiality of PN-N3 is that it could be treated as a simple,
less-time-consuming, cost-effective practical sensing system for determining
H2S in biological samples. Our probe can also be used in
pathological applications by developing an analyzing tool to detect
the abnormal endogenous H2S level, which is responsible
for various diseases.

Scheme 2 Stepwise Preparation of the PN-N3 Probe
Absorbance and Fluorescence
Studies
A stock solution
of PN-N3 (20 μM) was prepared
in acetonitrile–water. A H2S solution (from Na2S) of concentration 100 μM was prepared in Elix Millipore
water. All experiments were carried out using CH3CN/H2O (1:8, v/v) maintaining the pH at 7.0 (10 mM phosphate buffer).
During the titration, in the quartz optical cell of 1 cm optical path
length, each time, a 20 μM solution of PN-N3 was filled and a stock solution of Na2S was gradually added into it until saturation. After 1–2
min of the addition of H2S solution, spectral data were
recorded. For all fluorescence measurements, excitation was provided
at 435 nm and emission was collected between 485 and 580 nm.

Measurement
of Fluorescence Quantum Yield
The fluorescence
quantum yields (QY) of PN-N3 (Φ)
and PN-NH2 (Φ*) were determined
relative to a reference compound fluorescein (Φr =
0.95 in 0.1 M NaOH) at pH 7.0 (10 mM phosphate buffer). The same excitation
wavelength, gain, and slit band widths were applied for both samples.
The QY was calculated using the following equation66 2  where Ar and As are the absorbance of the reference and sample
solution at the reference excitation wavelength, FAr and
FAs are the corresponding integrated fluorescence intensities,
and η and η0 are the solvent refractive indexes
of the sample and reference, respectively.

Calculation of Limit of
Detection (LOD)
From the fluorescence
titration data, the detection limit of PN-N3 for H2S was calculated. The standard deviation
for the fluorescence intensity was determined from the measurements
of the emission intensity of four individual receptors without H2S 10 times. The evaluation was done by following the equation67 3  where K = 2 or 3 (here, we
took 3), SD is the standard deviation of the blank receptor solution,
and S is the slope of the calibration curve.
