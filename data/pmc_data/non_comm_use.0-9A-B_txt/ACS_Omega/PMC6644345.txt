A sustainable approach
for the production of high-purity potash
fertilizers devoid of chloride is highly needed. Conventional preparation
processes for chloride-free potash fertilizers have certain limitations,
such as complicated synthesis procedure, including high-temperature
requirement, causing environmental pollution. In this work, a novel
approach has been proposed for the production of high-purity potash
fertilizer (KNO3, K2SO4, and KH2PO4) from KCl by metathesis electrodialysis (MED).
Sulfonated poly(ether sulfone)-based cation-exchange membrane and
quaternized brominated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)-based
anion-exchange membranes are used for the MED experiments. The membranes
show adequate water uptake, ionic conductivity, and ion-exchange capacity
with good mechanical and thermal stabilities. The yields of KNO3, K2SO4, and KH2PO4 are found to be 90, 86, and 90%, respectively. The power consumptions
during MED experiment for KNO3, K2SO4, and KH2PO4 are calculated to 0.94, 0.89,
and 1.04 kWh/kg, respectively. The purity of products is confirmed
by inductively coupled plasma and X-ray diffraction analysis and by
measuring ionic contents. The process provides an energy-intensive
way for high-purity synthesis of KNO3, K2SO4, and KH2PO4.

==== Body
Introduction
Potassium is one of
the essential macronutrients like nitrogen
and phosphorous, which is consumed by plants.1,2 Interestingly,
potassium is responsible for more than 60 enzymatic systems in plants
that are essentially required for the synthesis of proteins, vitamins,
starch, and cellulose. It plays a vital role in photosynthesis, through
which plants get energy and control opening and closing of stomata
and thus it is required for tissue water balance in plants. However,
a deficiency of potassium is recorded in most of the soil, so one
can supply potassium to plants as fertilizers. Potash consumption
in 2009–2010 in India was 3.33 million tonnes; the demand of
fertilizers is ever growing. In 1971–1972, potash consumption
in India was 1.90 kg/ha, which upsurged to 17.1 kg/ha in 2008–2009,
a 9-fold increase.3 It is essential to
produce highly soluble, chlorine-free potassic fertilizers. Potassic
fertilizers are mainly categorized into two types: chlorine-containing
fertilizers, viz., KCl, and chloride-free fertilizers, such as KNO3, K2SO4, K2HPO4, K2CO3, etc. The most common potassic fertilizer
is potassium chloride (KCl), readily recovered from naturally occurring
raw materials of potash, which constitutes 90% of potassic fertilizers.4 The use of potassium chloride leads to increase
in the chloride content of the soil, excess concentration of which
causes toxicity in the crops grown and higher salinity and acidity
of the soil.5 The main disadvantage of
the presence of chloride in soil is the formation of hazardous compounds
by reaction with ammonium nitrate, the most common nitrogenous fertilizer.6 Chloride-free potash fertilizers, such as monopotassium
phosphate (KH2PO4), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), potassium nitrate (KNO3), etc.,
are preferred for chloride-sensitive crops. These potassium salts
are rare, usually produced when KCl reacts with nitrate, sulfate,
and monobasic phosphate source.7

Potassium nitrate is a highly soluble source, which contains two
most common elements, potassium and nitrate, essential for the growth
of plants. KNO3 is commonly used in fields where chloride-free
potash is required to fulfill the requirement of potash along with
nitrate without any further action and other transformation. KNO3 is mainly produced by the reaction of KCl with a nitrate
source like sodium nitrate, nitric acid, or ammonium nitrate according
to availability and requirement. Industrial production of KNO3 is based on the reaction of KCl and HNO3 in the
presence of pentanol.8 Three-fourths of
potassium sulfate was also produced by the reaction of KCl and dissolved
sulfates or sulfuric acid. Traditional methods for K2SO4 production are the Mannheim method, association–displacement
method, and double decomposition method.9,10 The Mannheim
method is quite simple with good product yield and quality, but there
are several drawbacks, such as strong corrosiveness and abrasiveness
of raw materials, high reaction temperature, high energy consumption,
and so on. K2SO4 is produced when KCl reacts
with ammonium sulfate, and it has high impurity. Zisner et al. also
reported the production of K2SO4 by differential
contacting process.5 Potassium phosphate
is also a highly soluble salt commonly used as fungicide, food additive,
and fertilizer. Traditionally, KH2PO4 is produced
from phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide, and water. The reaction
between phosphoric acid and potassium hydroxide is highly exothermic.
In 1989, Haifa Chemicals Ltd. prepared KH2PO4 using phosphoric acid and potassium chloride in the presence of
organic solvent with a long-chain primary amine. Monopotassium phosphate
produced by acidulation of phosphoric acid solution and amines is
regenerated by calcium oxide or calcium carbonate, but the overall
process is not economically viable.11 So,
there is a need of a simple and cheap method to produce chloride-free
potash.

Electrodialysis (ED) is found to be a potential-driven
process
used for the separation and recovery of valuable ionic species from
aqueous solution without waste generation.12−16 Metathesis electrodialysis (MED) is a modified electrodialysis
process that can convert one salt into another by double-ion-replacement
reaction. The MED process has many advantages over traditional metathesis
reaction, including high purity of product. MED has a great impact
where traditional processes are not applicable due to high solubility
of both substrate and product or tendency to form double salt.17

The aim of this work was to prepare chloride-free
potassic fertilizers
by an economically viable and eco-friendly process. Different phosphate,
sulfate, and nitrate sources were used along with low-cost potassic
fertilizer (KCl) to produce high-value potassium dihydrogen phosphate,
potassium sulfate, and potassium nitrate, which are rich sources of
potash, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(ether sulfone), obtained from Solvay
Chemicals Pvt Ltd., India, was used after drying. Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene
oxide) (PPO), N-bromosuccinimide, and N-methylmorpholine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethyl acetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,
KCl, NaH2PO4, Na2SO4,
and NaNO3 were supplied by S D Fine-Chem Ltd. Double-distilled
water was used throughout the experiment.

Methods
Sulfonated
poly(ether sulfone) (SPES)-based
cation-exchange membrane of thickness 190 μm and quaternized
brominated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (QPPO)-based anion-exchange
membranes of thickness 160 μm were prepared for MED experiment
by previously reported methods.16,18

Chemical, Thermal, Mechanical,
and Physicochemical Characterization
of Cation Exchange Membranes (CEM) and Anion Exchange Membranes (AEM)
Synthesized CEMs and AEMs were characterized for their chemical,
thermal, and mechanical behaviors by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and universal testing
machine, respectively. Membranes were physicochemically characterized
with their ion-exchange capacity (IEC), ionic conductivity (IC), water
uptake, number of water molecules per ionic site (λ), and dimensional
stability. Details are given in the Supporting Information section.

Metathesis Electrodialysis (MED) Process
for Synthesis of Chloride-Free
Potash
Metathesis electrodialysis (MED) experiments were
performed an in-house-made electrodialysis (ED) system having an effective
area of 200 cm2, as described in Scheme 1. ED stack contains an alternate arrangement
of CEMs and AEMs based on SPES and QPPO, respectively. In ED stack,
precious metal-oxide-coated titanium-based electrodes were used. ED
has four different compartments, as illustrated in a stack configuration:
two feed compartments and two product compartments. The first and
third compartments were charged with the feed solution in recirculation
mode of 3 L/h, whereas double-distilled water was used in the second
and fourth compartments. The turbulence of solutions was maintained
at the same flow rate by peristaltic pumps. Na2SO4 solution (0.02 M) was recirculated to avoid electrode reaction.
The experiment was conducted with 10 cell pairs of CEMs and AEMs at
a constant direct current electrical potential of 2 V/cell pair applied
potential. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and IC analyses were used
for the determination of ionic concentration in the product compartment
at a regular interval. I–V curve of CEM and AEM in the MED process was also recorded in equilibration
with 0.10 M KCl solution by varying the applied potential from 0 to
5 V/cell pair with the interval of 0.5 V. The specific energy consumption
(P) and current efficiency (CE) for production of
potassic fertilizers were calculated by standard formula, and the
details are given in the Supporting Information section.

(MED) Process
for the Production of Chloride-Free Potash
Results and Discussion
Functional group determination
in CEM and AEM was conducted by
FTIR spectroscopy, and the corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 1. In spectrum of
CEM, the broad absorption band was observed between 3300 and 3500
cm–1 associated with −OH stretching vibrations
of water molecules present in association with ionic sites. The absorption
band at 1585 cm–1 attributed to the −C=C
stretching vibrations of aromatic skeleton of polymer. The two absorption
peaks at 1160 and 1103 cm–1 are characteristic of
aromatic SO3– stretching vibrations.
The peak for aryl oxide appears at 1239 cm–1.19Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectra of AEM; a sharp peak at 1114 cm–1 confirms the quaternization reaction between brominated
PPO and N-methylmorpholine. The absorption band at
1600 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching vibration
of −C=C– in the phenyl ring present in the polymer
backbone. A dominant peak at 1185 cm–1 indicates
the stretching of −C–O–C– bond in between
the phenyl ring. The absorption band at 1470 cm–1 arises due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of
the phenyl group.20

Figure 1 FTIR spectra for ion-exchange
membranes.

Thermal stabilities of AEM and
CEM were analyzed by TGA, and the
corresponding thermograph is presented in Figure 2. Both the membranes have weight losses of
4.39 and 5.83%, respectively, in the temperature range of 80–120
°C due to the presence of water molecules as bound water. Thereafter,
weight losses in the temperature range of 200–430 °C for
AEM and CEM were found to be 12.48 and 9.58%, respectively, due to
degradation of the functional group present as ion-exchange moiety
in membranes. The major weight loss was recorded above 450 °C
due to degradation of the polymer backbone. The above discussion shows
that both AEM and CEM are thermally stable. The stress–strain
curves for CEM and AEM in wet and dry states are presented in Figure 3, and the corresponding
elastic modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break are presented
in Table 1. Both membranes
showed higher tensile strength and elastic modulus in dry condition
compared to the wet condition. The measured tensile strength was almost
double, and the elastic modulus was 3 times higher than that in the
wet condition for both CEM and AEM. The elongation at break in the
wet state is found to be higher as water molecules associated with
an ionic group present in the membrane matrix show plasticizing behavior
in the wet state. The results show that CEM and AEM used were mechanically
stable and flexible in nature.

Table 2 shows the
physicochemical and electrochemical properties of IEMs. IEMs should
possess a moderate amount of water uptake, high ion-exchange capacity,
and high ionic conductivity for efficiency and viability of electromembrane
process. Both CEM and AEM show an appreciable amount of mass gain
when equilibrated with water, with values of 12.12 and 27.7%, respectively.
Water uptake by IEMs determines the movement of counterion and mechanical
stability of membranes. Higher water uptake leads to poor mechanical
stability of IEM, whereas moderate amount of water in the membrane
retains the stability along with high transport of ions. Ion-exchange
capacity (IEC) represents the number of ion-exchange groups present
in IEMs. IECs for CEM and AEM were calculated to be 1.40 and 2.15
meq/g, respectively. With the boost of ion-exchangeable groups, water
molecules per unit ionic site also increases. Water molecules present
in matrix interconnect the ionic channels, which enhances the transport
of counterions. The ionic conductivity (IC) of IEMs determines the
feasibility of membrane under electromembrane process. Higher ionic
conductivity results in the lower power consumption, which favors
product formation. The calculated IC values for both CEM and AEM are
3.15 × 10–2 and 1.30 × 10–2 S/cm, respectively, which well matched the values reported in the
literature.16,18

Current–voltage characteristic
of IEMs are taken from 0.5
to 4.5 V/cell pair after equilibrating the IEMs in 0.1 M salt solution
and are presented in Figure 4. Three characteristic regions are found, viz, ohmic, plateau,
and nonohmic. These regions represent the characteristics of IEMs
in terms of ion-transport mechanism and concentration polarization
phenomenon. From the figure, it is clear that current is directly
proportional to applied voltage and thus obeys Ohm’s law in
the ohmic region due to the presence of a large number of ions in
solution, whereas in the plateau region, current becomes almost constant,
which shows concentration polarization. Thereafter, in the nonohmic
region, current rises steeply due to dissociation of water molecules
at higher applied potential. It was concluded that our region of interest
is the plateau region and that whole MED experiments were carried
out in this region.

Figure 4 Current against applied potential for MED process.

K2SO4 is
produced during MED using KCl and
Na2SO4 reactants at 2 V/cell pair applied potential
across the electrodes. During the conversion process, a 2:1 stoichiometric
ratio of KCl and Na2SO4 was used. The overall
stoichiometric equation for K2SO4 synthesis
is given below  Figure 5 shows the current density value vs time
for different feed
concentrations. The current density value first increases and then
decreases with time due to the higher concentration gradient between
feed and product compartments. However, over time, concentration of
ions gradually decreases and maintains equilibrium in both the compartments,
which leads to decrease in the current density. From the graph, it
can be seen that the current density value is higher for feed with
1.0 M concentration than for feed with 0.2 M concentration. Figure 6 shows the conversion
of K2SO4 from KCl with respect to time during
MED. Herein, K2SO4 is a product formed by the
ion-displacement reaction of KCl and Na2SO4.
The concentrations of Na2SO4 and KCl as well
as the applied voltage for the migration of ions have been optimized
during the whole process. The feed was filled in compartments 1 and
3 (KCl and Na2SO4), while deionized water was
filled in compartments 2 and 4. Double-displacement reaction takes
place between KCl and Na2SO4, and the formation
of products K2SO4 and NaCl occur in compartments
2 and 4, respectively. The migration of K+ and SO42– starts from compartments 1 and 3, respectively,
to compartment 2 as we apply potential. From the graph, it can be
easily seen that the concentration of KCl decreases with time; on
the other hand, the concentration of K2SO4 increases.
The initial concentration of KCl in the first compartment was 0.99
M, but as a result of migration of ions, this concentration was reduced
to 0.69 M after 30 min. Simultaneously, the concentration of K2SO4 (0.15 M) in compartment 3 revealed the formation
of product. The runtime of the experiment was 5 h, where the concentration
of the product was found to be about 0.43 M. In the same time, migration
of Na+ and Cl– occurs from compartments
3 and 1, respectively, to compartment 4 to form NaCl (Scheme 1). Figure 7 shows the formation of NaCl during MED.
The formation of K2SO4 as a product takes place
in the second compartment, whereas the formation of NaCl takes place
in the fourth compartment. The formation of NaCl enhances the product
formation due to the higher depletion of ions from their respective
reactant compartments, so the respective product shall increase. Figure 7 (inset) focuses
on the effect of optimized voltage on the product conversion. It is
clear from the graph that the formation of product is higher when
applied voltage is 2.5 V/cell pair compared to 2 V/cell pair. Solid
K2SO4 crystals were obtained by evaporating
the water from the product compartment solution obtained by the MED
process. Figure 8 shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of synthesized K2SO4. Peaks at 2θ values of 21.6, 29.95, 30.93, and 43.44
are attributed to the structure of arcanite, which well matched with
the literature.5,9 The purity of K2SO4 crystals has also been checked by ICP analysis of the dried
solid material.

Highly valuable potassium nitrate was synthesized by MED
experiment
using 0.6 M K2SO4 and 1.2 M NaNO3 as feed solutions for compartments 1 and 3, respectively, whereas
DI water was used in the other two compartments (Scheme 1). The experiments were carried
out at applied voltages of 1.5 and 2 V/cell pair. K+ from
feed 1 migrated to compartment 2, and NO3– migrated from feed 3 to compartment 2, leading to dilution of feed
1 and feed 3, whereas concentrating compartment 2 with KNO3. Similarly, Na+ migrated from feed 2 to compartment 4
and SO42– migrated from feed 1 to compartment
4, concentrating with Na2SO4. The overall equation
for the production of KNO3 using MED process is shown below  Figure 9A,B shows the conversion of KNO3 from K2SO4 with time at applied potentials of 1.5 and 2.0 V/cell
pair, respectively. Initially, after 2 h at 1.5 V/cell pair, the concentration
of KNO3 in compartment 2 was 0.57 M, whereas the concentration
of K2SO4 in compartment 1 reduced to 0.21 M.
Initially, ion migration was quick because of higher concentration
of ions in compartments 1 and 3 and hence the formation of KNO3 in compartment 2 was higher, and after 2 h of experiment,
no significant change was observed in the concentration of KNO3. Over time, the concentration difference of ions in both
the compartments decreased so that migration of ions became slow.
At 2.0 V/cell pair applied potential (Figure 9B), the overall production of KNO3 increased. The concentration of KNO3 increased efficiently
to 0.65 mol/L in the small interval of 2 h, which was quite higher
than that during the production at 1.5 V/cell pair. Over time, ion
migration from feed compartment to product compartment was rapid,
and finally, the concentration of KNO3 in product compartment
was found to be 0.97 M, whereas the concentration of K2SO4 decreased from 0.6 to 0.066 M. Figure 10 presents the concentration of Na2SO4 in the fourth compartment at applied voltages of 1.5
and 2 V/cell pair. From the figure, it is clear that 2 V/cell pair
applied voltage is more effective in production of KNO3 and Na2SO4 as byproduct. The Na2SO4 produced in this process was used in the former process
for the synthesis of K2SO4. To check the purity
of KNO3, XRD analysis was carried out and the result is
presented in Figure 11. Crystalline KNO3 was obtained by evaporating water from
product compartment solution produced during MED experiment. Diffraction
peaks at 27.8, 32.37, 34.43, and 47.55 were found to be associated
with the crystal structure of KNO3.21 The purity of the product was also checked by ICP analysis
of the dried solid material. This shows the production of high-purity
KNO3 during MED without impurity.

KH2PO4 from KCl and NaH2PO4 was also synthesized
by MED, with NaCl formed as byproduct,
as presented in the following equation  From the above
equation, it is clear that
1:1 molar ratio is required for completion of reaction. Different
feed concentrations of KCl were used to evaluate the quantitative
yield of KH2PO4. During MED process, 0.1, 0.2,
and 0.5 M KCl and NaH2PO4 were used as feed
solution in compartments 1 and 3, respectively, whereas DI water was
used in compartments 2 and 4 (Scheme 1). Scheme 1 shows the arrangement of ion-exchange membranes and different
compartments during MED process; for applied voltage, K+ ion migrated from feed compartment 1 to product compartment 2, whereas
H2PO4– migrated from compartment
3 to compartment 2, leading to the formation of KH2PO4 in the product compartment. Similarly, in the fourth compartment,
the concentrations of Cl– and Na+ increased
over time, forming NaCl as byproduct. Figure 12 (inset) shows the decrease of KCl concentration
with time. On applying a constant potential of 2 V/cell pair, for
different feed concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M KCl, the concentration
of KCl decreased from the initial value to 0.007, 0.05, and 0.16 M,
respectively, after 2 h. Figure 12 shows the concentrations of KH2PO4 for different feed concentrations after 2 h of MED process as 0.061,
0.11, and 0.24 M for feed solutions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M, respectively,
whereas after 4 h, the concentrations reached 0.095, 0.16, and 0.36
M, respectively. Nearly 90% conversion in the experiment was completed
in a span of 4 h. Figure 13 (inset) shows the reduction in the concentration of NaH2PO4 with time for different feed concentrations
of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M. From the figure, it is clear that reduction
is very fast at higher concentration than at lower concentrations.
After 4 h of experiment, the concentrations of NaH2PO4 in compartment 3 were 0.0015, 0.0038, and 0.086 for feed
concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M, respectively. Figure 13 shows the production of NaCl
as byproduct in the fourth compartment for 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M concentrations
of NaH2PO4; the yield of byproduct in the fourth
compartment was higher than 90%. It was observed from Figures 12 and 13 that 0.1 M feed concentrations of KCl and NaH2PO4 required relatively less time for conversion to KH2PO4 and NaCl, whereas higher feed concentration of 0.5
M required more time for the conversion. The number of co-ions increases
in the solution at higher concentration, which is responsible for
the sluggish movement of ions. Co-ion transport across the membrane
during the MED process regulates the quality of product, but no co-ion
transport was observed throughout the process.8

with different feed concentrations of NaH2PO4 and KCl during metathesis electrodialysis (MED) process with 2 V

Energy consumption and current
efficiency data were evaluated for
the performance of MED experiment during conversion of K2SO4, KNO3, and KH2PO4 with 2 V/cell pair applied potential, and the results are presented
in Table 3. The CE
and P at 2 V potential are found to be 82% and 0.94
kWh/kg, respectively, for K2SO4 production,
whereas 87.0% and 0.89 kWh/kg, respectively, for KNO3.
The lowest CE and higher power consumption were calculated for the
KH2PO4 synthesis, which were 81% and 1.04 kWh/kg,
respectively. The 2 V/cell pair applied potential was found to be
most suitable for the production of chloride-free potash by MED experiment.

Conclusions
A
novel synthesis approach, metathesis electrodialysis, is developed
to obtain high-value potassic fertilizers (K2SO4, KNO3, and KH2PO4) with high purity
to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches. Quaternized
poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)-based AEM and sulfonated poly(ether
sulfone)-based CEM at an applied voltage of 2 V/cell pair were used
for the MED process. AEM and CEM show good physicochemical and electrochemical
properties with good thermal and mechanical stabilities and are found
to be suitable for MED process due to their low electro-osmotic drag.
Stoichiometric ratios of the reactant of 2:1, 2:1, and 1:1 for the
production of K2SO4, KNO3, and KH2PO4, respectively, provide optimum results. MED
shows low power consumption and good current efficiency of the order
of 1 kWh/kg and 80%, respectively, for the production of potassic
fertilizer. The obtained product is confirmed to be of high purity
by XRD. The byproduct formed during the synthesis of KNO3 (Na2SO4) is utilized for the formation of
K2SO4 by MED. In brief, MED is an environmentally
friendly and less expensive process to produce high-purity potassic
fertilizers.
