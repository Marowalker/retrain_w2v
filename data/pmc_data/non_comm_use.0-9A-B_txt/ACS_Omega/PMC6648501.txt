An amide-based smart probe (L) is explored for nanomolar
detection of Mo(VI) ion in a ratiometric manner, involving hydrogen-bond-assisted
chelation-enhanced fluorescence process through inhibition of photoinduced
electron transfer process. The recognition of Mo(VI) is associated
with a 17-fold fluorescence enhancement and confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction of the resulting Mo(VI) complex (M1). Further, M1
selectively recognizes arsenite through green emission of their adduct
(C1) with an 81-fold fluorescence enhancement. Interestingly, dihydrogen
phosphate causes dissociation of C1 back to free L having weak fluorescence.
The methods are fast, highly selective, and allow their bare eye visualization
at physiological pH. All of the interactions have been substantiated
by time-dependent density functional theory calculations to rationalize
their spectroscopic properties. The corresponding lowest detection
limits are 1.5 × 10–8 M for Mo(VI), 1.2 ×
10–10 M for AsO2–,
and 3.2 × 10–6 M for H2PO4–, whereas the respective association constants
are 4.21 × 105 M–1 for Mo(VI), 6.49
× 104 M–1 for AsO2–, and 2.11 × 105 M–1 for H2PO4–. The L is useful
for efficient enrichment of Mo(VI) from aqueous solution, while M1
efficiently removes AsO2– from environmental
samples by solid-phase extraction.

Introduction
Designing smart probe
for selective optical recognition of bioactive
and environment relevant ions is an attractive research area having
immense importance in biomedical exploration and environmental monitoring.1−5 The available techniques6 for this purpose
include inductively coupled plasma mass/atomic emission spectroscopy,7,8 atomic absorption spectroscopy,9,10 colorimetry,11 spectrophotometry,12,13 and voltammetry14,15 that either require sophisticated
expensive equipment, tedious time-consuming sample preparation, and
skilled operator or provide low sensitivity with significant erroneous
results. On the other hand, the fluorescence method provides instantaneous
detection, visual perception, and a low-cost methodology that excludes
intrinsic sample pretreatment. A cascade approach for determination
of multiple ions is cost-effective, time-saving, and highly desirable
for practical applications.16,17

Molybdenum18−21 and its alloys have small expansion coefficient, high melting point,
and good conductivity and corrosion resistance.22−26 Mo is a cofactor of several enzymes like nitrogenase,
aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase, sulfite oxidase, nitrate reductase,
and xanthine dehydrogenase.18−20 Although rare, Mo deficiency
enhances uric acid content in blood leading to inflammation, joint
pain, neurological problems,20 and metabolism
of sulfur-containing amino acids.25 Bioaccumulation
of Mo(VI) ion released from CoCrMo implants results in abnormal cellular
proliferation and function.27,28 Moreover, Mo-containing
enzymes are used in common bacterial catalysis for nitrogen fixation.29 Nevertheless, excess Mo stemming from industrial
and environmental contaminations damages biological process.30,31 Thus, trace-level detection of Mo(VI) is essential for industrial
and biological applications.32,33

On the other
hand, arsenic toxicity is responsible for cardiovascular
disease, neurodegenerative disorders, etc.34−38 Among several arsenic species, inorganic arsenics
like arsenite and arsenate are more abundant and toxic than organoarsenic
species, viz., monomethyl and dimethyl arsonic acids.39 Again, arsenite is more poisonous over arsenate due to
its higher binding affinity toward sulfhydryl unit of proteins and
enzymes.40−43 Thus, determination of trace-level arsenite and its removal from
samples before intake to living body are highly demanding.44−46

However, arsenite selective turn-on fluorescence probes are
rare.
To date, two turn-on probes available for direct detection of arsenite
suffer from poor detection limit.47 The
long-standing Gutzeit method48 for arsenic
determination involves generation of deadly AsH3 gas.49−54

The present report of arsenite determination has good detection
limit (1.2 × 10–10 M) and high association
constant, and is useful for bioimaging and effective for solid-phase
extractive removal.

Conversely, phosphate and its derivatives
play a significant role
in signal transduction and energy storage in biological systems.55−58 A few 2,2′-dipicolylamine-based Zn(II) complexes recognize
inorganic phosphates through turn-on/off fluorescence47,59−63 while ratiometric probe for phosphate recognition is rare.48,49 Recently, a quinoline-based zinc complex49b has been used for sequential detection of AsO2– and H2PO4– that function
via intramolecular charge transfer (CT) and displacement mechanism.
The zinc complex detects AsO2– (2.5 ×
10–8 M) and H2PO4– (6.1 μM) with relatively poor binding constants, 1.1 ×
10–3 and 5.6 × 10–4 M, respectively.
Notably, hydrazone derivative49,50a is used in drug for
cancer and leprosy, and as plasticizer, polymer stabilizer, antioxidant,
polymerization inhibitor, herbicide, insecticide, and plant stimulant.
Moreover, amide functionality, the backbone of peptides is used as
drug carrier in living systems.50b,50c

The
molecular arithmetic that alters chemically programmed analysis
(input) into optical signal1,2 (output) is an exciting
research area in contemporary unconventional computing system64−66 that allows to build scientific logic gate using the probe.

The present article reports a systematic study of a new X-ray structurally
characterized simple probe for selective recognition of Mo(VI) ion,
and the resulting Mo(VI) complex (M1) has potential to recognize arsenite
(AsO2–). Moreover, the arsenite adduct
(C1) of the Mo(VI) complex efficiently detects phosphate (H2PO4–) ion.

For this purpose, a
simple azine–amide-based probe (L), N′1,N′3-bis((E)-3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzylidene)malonohydrazide,
has been synthesized
by condensation of malonohydrazide and 3-ethoxysalicyaldehyde (Scheme 1). L binds Mo(VI)
through N and O donor sites, leading to stable eight-coordinated oxo-bridged
dimeric complex (M1), the structure of which is confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. This M1 efficiently detects poisonous
arsenite, and the resulting arsenite adduct (C1) efficiently detects
dihydrogen phosphate. Several spectroscopic techniques and density
functional theory (DFT) studies have been performed to authenticate
their cascade interaction (Figures S31–S43 and Tables S1–S6, Supporting Information (SI)). Moreover,
L efficiently extracts Mo(VI) from water to ethyl acetate, allowing
Mo(VI) enrichment. The silica-immobilized M1 is suitable for efficient
solid-phase extractive removal of AsO2– from environmental samples.61 Thus, the
present azine–imine-based optical probe (L) detects 1.5 ×
10–8 M Mo(VI) having association constant 4.21 ×
105 M–1. The binding interaction is authenticated
from single-crystal X-ray structure of new Mo(VI) complex (M1). The
sequential detection limits for AsO2– and H2PO4– are 1.2 ×
10–10 and 3.2 × 10–6 M, respectively,
whereas the corresponding binding constants are 6.49 × 104 and 2.11 × 105 M–1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Protocol of L
Results and Discussion
Single-Crystal X-ray Structure
of M1
Figure 1 displays the molecular structure
(Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot view) of the dimeric complex (M1),
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Table S1, SI). The asymmetric unit indicates
that L is bonded to Mo(VI) through imine N, amide N, and phenol O
donors, leading to molecular formulae C23H26Mo2N4O12 having formula weight 742.36.
The monoclinic crystal has space group C2/c. Selected bond lengths and angles are presented in Table S1 (SI). The M1 has two Mo(VI)–O
bonds having lengths 2.320(3) and 2.015(2) Å, while one Mo(VI)–N
bond length is 2.234(3) Å. Crystal packing is based on weak intermolecular
interaction between methoxy and phenolic O centers of M1. As a direct
consequence of the very distinct chemical nature of the L bonded to
Mo(VI) (methoxy, imine, and amide), the MoO5N octahedral
geometry (methoxy and one of the oxoterminal ligands occupying
axial positions) is slightly distorted. Thus, trans octahedral angles
(OMoO and OMoN) are in the 106.72–155.35° range, while
bond lengths range from ∼1.69 Å (for terminal oxo groups)
to ∼2.32 Å (for methoxy ligand).67 Each Mo(VI) center is bonded to L through one methoxy, two terminal
oxo groups, and a O donor from amide group. Figure S1 (SI) shows infinite chain of [L–Mo(VI)] units linked
by weak intermolecular interaction in different layers. Figure S2 (SI) shows the three-dimensional view
of crystal packing in wireframe model.

structure of dimeric Mo(VI) complex (M1).

Spectroscopic Studies
The steady-state emission spectrum
of L is perturbed68 in the presence of
nanomolar Mo(VI), while other
common competing cations, viz., Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+, VO2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cu+, Pd2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Ag+, Hg2+, and Au+ remain spectator in 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES)-buffered MeOH/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4; λex, 302 nm). Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the selectivity
of L for Mo(VI).

Figure 2 Color change of L in the presence of common ions: under
UV light
(left) and visible light (right).

Figure 3 Emission (a) and absorption (b) spectra of L (media and pH mentioned
supra) in the presence of Mo(VI) and other common metal ions (λex = 302 nm).

Spectroscopic features of L are governed by pH of the media,
as
it has pH-susceptible donor sites.69 Furthermore,
biological use of L demands its efficiency at physiological pH. Hence,
the effect of pH on the emission profile of L in the presence and
absence of Mo(VI) is tested (pH 3.0–12.0). Difference in emission
intensities between free L and its Mo(VI) complex being highest near
physiological pH 7.4 (Figure S3, SI), it
is maintained for entire studies using 20 mM HEPES-buffered MeOH/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4). Similarly, recognition studies of AsO2– and H2PO4– ions are carried out in specific media and pH.

Addition of
Mo(VI) to L red-shifts the well-defined emission from
403 nm (λex = 302 nm) to 449 nm with blue emission
(Figure 2). With increasing
Mo(VI) concentration, the intensity of 449 nm band enhances up to
17-fold while the intensity of the 403 nm band decreases in a ratiometric
manner with an iso-emissive point at 422 nm (Figure 4a). However, addition of more than 80 equiv.
Mo(VI) quenches the fluorescence, possibly due to static quenching.67,70,71

Figure 4 Changes in the spectra of L (20 μM)
upon addition Mo(VI):
(a) emission (λex = 302 nm) and (b) absorption; [Mo(VI)]
= 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000,
1200, 1400, 1500, 1800, 2000, 2400, and 3000 μM, same media
as stated above.

The effect of other common
metal ions during Mo(VI) sensing is
tested for possible interference by competitive experiment. Figure S4 (SI) reveals no significant interference.
Furthermore, the plot of emission intensity versus [Mo(VI)] is sigmoidal
(Figure S5, SI) having linearity up to
2.0 μM Mo(VI). The lowest detection limit68−71 for Mo(VI) is 1.5 × 10–8 M (Figure S6, SI). The
ratiometric plot (F449nm/F403nm vs [Mo(VI)]) is presented in Figure S7 (SI). The quantum yields of L and its Mo(VI) complex
are 0.026 and 0.156, respectively.

The UV–vis spectrum
of free L has a weak band at 339 nm.
Upon gradual addition of Mo(VI), the absorbance of three bands at
302, 382, and 479 nm increases (Figure 4b).

Job’s plot68,69 supports 1:2 (mole ratio) binding
stoichiometry between L and Mo(VI) (Figure S8, SI), corroborated by the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) image (m/z, 762.18 for
[M1 + H]+) (Figure S9, SI) and
single-crystal X-ray structure of M1. Treatment of fluorescence titration
data by the Hill equation allows determination of the association
constant, 4.21 × 105 M–1 (Figure S10, SI). In the presence of Mo(VI), L turns blue and
yellow under UV and visible light, respectively (Figure 2).

The weak fluorescence
of L is well explained from its planar geometry,
revealed by density functional theory (DFT) studies that allow the
photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process69,72 (Scheme 2). The weak
emission of L may be due to PET process from amide N to π-conjugated
system involving >C=N– functionality. Addition of
Mo(VI)
ion prevents this PET through initiation of chelation-enhanced fluorescence
(CHEF) process resulting significant fluorescence enhancement accompanied
by prominent red shift (Scheme 2). Addition of Mo(VI) to L enhances the absorbance at 302
nm (ε, M–1 cm–1) (4.2 ×
106) and 479 nm (1.7 × 104). The latter
may be a CT process from L to Mo(VI) (ligand-to-metal charge transfer)
(Figure 3b). The SCXRD
structure of the M1 also supports the CHEF process.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mo(VI) Sensing
Mechanism
To reveal the binding
mode in solution, 1H NMR titration
of L by Mo(VI) has been performed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (Figure 5). Upon addition of 0.5 equiv Mo(VI) to L, its imine
proton (−CH=N–, denoted as “c”)
downfield-shifted from 8.965 to 9.512 ppm, while “b”
proton is shifted from 10.826 to 11.156 ppm, indicating interaction
of imine and amide N with Mo(VI), leading to inhibition of PET process.
Further addition of Mo(VI) to L (after 5 min) shifts both c and b
protons further downfield. Upon addition of 1 equiv Mo(VI), phenol
proton (d) at 11.851 ppm of L disappears (Figure 5) while all aromatic protons upfield-shifted.
All of these indicate involvement of N and O donors of L toward Mo(VI)
binding.

Figure 5 1H NMR titration in DMSO-d6 (top); atom numbering scheme (bottom).

DFT studies have been achieved for both L and its Mo(VI)
complex
using B3LYP functional combined with the association consistent67,70−74 cc-pVDZ basis set for C, N, H, and O atoms. For Mo(VI), the Stuttgart
relativistic small-core effective core potentials and their companion
basis sets are used. Although the energies of both highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
reduced in the Mo(VI) bound state, the extent of stabilization of
the LUMO is higher than that of HOMO causing an overall decrease of
the energy gap from 0.05537 to 0.03768 eV (Figure 6). In the case of L, the electron density
at HOMO is spread throughout the molecule, which slightly moves toward
Mo(VI) center in M1. After binding to Mo(VI), the charge density is
more prominent at the vicinity of imine-bound Mo(VI), as observed
from LUMO. The optimized geometries of L and the M1 complex are presented
in Figure S11 (SI).

Figure 6 HOMO–LUMO energy
gaps in L and M1.

Interestingly, the M1
complex selectively recognizes arsenite ratiometrically
by absorption and emission spectroscopy (Figure 7). In the presence of arsenite, M1 shows
green emission at 494 nm while other common anions, viz., Cl–, Br–, F–, I–, SCN–, AcO–, NO3–, SO42–, NO2–, ClO4–, OH–, HSO4–, S2–, AsO43–, OCl–, H2PO4–, and N3– remain silent in DMSO/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4) (Figures 8 and S12 (SI)). Figure S13 (SI) shows the emission spectra of M1 in the presence and absence
of arsenite. Figure S3 (SI) indicates that
M1 efficiently detects arsenite at physiological pH 7.4. In the presence
of arsenite, the emission maxima of M1 (λex, 336
nm; λem, 494 nm) is red-shifted by 101 nm along with
81-fold fluorescence enhancement (Φ, 15.57-fold enhancement).
The lowest detection limit is 1.2 × 10–10 M,
much lower than WHO-recommended tolerance level (≈10 μg/L)
in drinking water (Figure S14, SI). Moreover,
in the presence of arsenite, a 4.2-fold enhancement of F494nm/F393nm is observed (Figure S15, SI).

Figure 7 Changes in the (a) emission and (b) absorbance
spectra of M1 (20
μM) upon addition of AsO2– in DMSO/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4 media λex = 336 nm);
[NaAsO2] = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300,
400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1800, 2000, 2400, and 3000
μM.

Figure 8 Changes in the spectra (a) emission (λex = 336
nm) and (b) absorption of M1 in the presence of common anions (media
mentioned supra).

Addition of M1 to AsO2– results in
two new absorption bands at 367 and 477 nm (Figure 8b). Job’s plot67−71 supports 1:1 binding (mole ratio) between M1 and
AsO2– (Figure S16, SI), corroborated by the mass spectrum of the [M1–AsO2–] adduct. The binding constant69 of M1 for AsO2– is 6.49 × 104 (Figure S17, SI). The quantum yields of the M1 and its AsO2– adduct are 0.156 and 0.632, respectively. In the presence of AsO2–, the yellow solution of M1 turns bright
green and orange in UV and visible lights, respectively (Figure 9). The performance
of M1 with reported probes is presented in Table S2 (SI).

Figure 9 Colors of M1 (20 μM) under UV (top) and visible
(bottom)
lights in the presence of AsO2– (media
mentioned supra).

The strong hydrogen
bond between M1 and AsO2– enhances the
rigidity and lowers the entropy of the resulting adduct,
leading to fluorescence enhancement. This is reflected in fluorescence
lifetime data2a (Figure 10a), which increases from 0.102 ns for L
to 0.232 ns for M1 to 1.268 ns for C154,64−66,75 (Scheme 2).

Figure 10 (a) Fluorescence lifetime decay of M1 and C1
in the presence of
AsO2– and H2PO4–, respectively; (b) HOMO–LUMO energy gaps
in M1 and C1.

The IR band of M1 at
3486 cm–1 shifts to 3203
cm–1 in [M1–AsO2–] adduct (C1), indicating H-bond interaction of amide −NH
with AsO2– (Figures S18 and S19, SI). 1H NMR spectra also corroborate
this interaction (Figure 5). Upon addition of 0.5 equiv AsO2– to M1, the −CH=N proton (c) experiences no shift from
9.512 ppm, indicating its noninteraction with AsO2– ion. All aromatic protons exhibit upfield shift. The
aliphatic protons slightly move upfield. The amide −NH proton
(b) shifted downfield by 0.2865 ppm, indicating its interaction with
AsO2– ion. Upon addition of 1.0 equiv
AsO2– to M1, the −NH proton further
shifts downfield by 0.2926 ppm, confirming the interaction of amide
−NH proton with AsO2– ion, also
corroborated by the ESI mass spectra of C1 (Figure S20, SI). Upon addition of AsO2– ion, the mass of M1 at m/z 762.18
[M1 + H]+ changes to 852.6591 [C1 + H]+ and
884.5736 for [C1 + CH3OH + H]+, supporting the
1:1 stoichiometry between M1 and AsO2– ion (Figures S9 and S20, SI).

The
optimized geometries of the M1 and its AsO2– adduct have been derived from time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation in gas phase using Gaussian
09W program (Figure 10b). The HOMO–LUMO energy gap of M1 is 0.03768 eV. The electron
density of M1 that is distributed over HOMO–LUMO is affected
by the influence of hydrogen bond with AsO2– ion. As a result, the energy gap decreases by 0.03259 eV. The resulting
optimized structure of C1 is shown in Figure S21 (SI) while favorable electronic transition energies of predominant
absorption bands are shown in Tables S4–S6 (SI).

On the other hand, the interaction of C1 with H2PO4– in the presence of common
anions has been
investigated. The H2PO4–-induced
notable change in the emission spectra of C1 allows its fluorescence
detection (Figures 11 and S22, SI). The changes in the optical
spectra of C1 in the presence of H2PO4– are presented in Figure 11. The emission intensity of C1 changes ratiometrically with
increasing H2PO4– concentration
having a linear region (Figures 12 and S23, SI). The binding
affinity calculated using the Hill equation69 is 2.11 × 105 M–1, much stronger
than that observed for AsO2– by M1 supra
(Figure S24, SI). The 1:1 (mole ratio)
interaction between C1 and H2PO4– is observed from Job’s plot (Figure S25, SI) and corroborated by ESI-MS spectra, m/z 1008.8445 (for [C3 + H]+). The major peak at m/z 451.5298 corresponds to free L (Figure S26, SI). The lowest detection limit for
H2PO4– is 3.2 × 10–6 M (Figure S23, SI). The
mass spectrum demonstrates that H2PO4– extracts Mo(VI) out from its AsO2– adduct
(C1), thereby releasing weakly fluorescent free L.

Figure 11 Sequential interaction
of L with Mo(VI), AsO2–, and H2PO4–: (a) emission
and (b) absorption spectra.

Figure 12 Spectral change of C1 (20 μM) upon addition of H2PO4– (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100,
200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1800, 2000, 2400,
and 3000 μM): (a) emission (λex = 336 nm),
(b) absorption (media mentioned supra).

Thus, it is proposed that arsenite forms hydrogen bond with
amide
moiety coordinated to Mo(VI) leading to C1 adduct54,64−66,75 (Scheme 3). Addition of H2PO4– leads to extraction of Mo(VI) from its AsO2– adduct (C1), thereby releasing weakly
fluorescent free L (Scheme S1, SI).

Scheme 3 Proposed Sensing Mechanism
1H NMR titration in DMSO-d6 also supports the interaction between C1 and H2PO4– (Figure 5). Upon addition of 0.5 equiv H2PO4– to C1, the imine proton (−CH=N–,
c) is shifted upfield from 9.516 to 9.288 ppm, while b proton is shifted
from 11.521 to 11.256 ppm, indicating uncoordination of imine and
amide N from Mo(VI), leading to dissociation of C1. Further addition
of H2PO4– to C1 (after 5 min)
shifts both c and b protons more upfield. Thus, upon addition of 1
equiv H2PO4–, the phenol proton
(“d”) of L reappears at 11.848 ppm that firmly establishes
the release of L by dissociation of C1 (Figure 5).

Interestingly, M1 can also recognize
H2PO4– in addition to AsO2–. However, fluorescence sensitivity for
H2PO4– is much lower than
that for AsO2–. Moreover, the emission
of M1 experiences a red shift
in the presence of AsO2–, while it remains
almost unaltered for H2PO4–. The changes in the absorption spectra of M1 are almost same for
both H2PO4– and AsO2– (Figure 13).

Figure 13 Changes in the optical spectra upon addition of AsO2– and H2PO4– separately to M1 as well as upon their sequential addition to M1:
(a) emission (λex = 336 nm) and (b) absorption (media
mentioned supra).

Thus, M1 is a better
sensor for AsO2–. The binding constant
and limit of detection (LOD) of M1 for H2PO4– are 9.16 × 104 and 3.88 ×
10–5 M, respectively, as determined
from fluorescence data.

The time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT) calculations
in gas phase for L, C1, and transient C3 have been performed using
Gaussian 09W program (Figure 14). The HOMO–LUMO energy gap for C1 is 0.03259 eV, which
increases to 0.07021 eV in C3, i.e., H2PO4–-bound form of C1 and thus energetically unfavorable.
Hence, C3 is a transient species and decomposes back to L having a
HOMO–LUMO gap of 0.06426 eV. The energy-optimized structure
of L is shown in Figure S21 (SI). Interestingly,
the fluorescence lifetime of the [C1–H2PO4–] adduct (C3) is 0.103 ns, very close to that
of L (0.102 ns; Figure 10a), which also corroborates decomposition of C3.

composed of an inverted fluorescence microscope, while
A549 cell is chosen for imaging purpose. Images are recorded with
a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera equipped with an EVOS FL, Invitrogen

In vitro cytotoxicity is measured
by colorimetric methyl thiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assay against A549

medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells are seeded
into 24-well tissue culture plates overnight and then incubated for
48 h in the presence of M1 at different concentrations (10–100
μM). Then, the cells are washed with phosphate-buffered saline
and 500 mL of supplemented DMEM medium is added. After that, 50 mL
of MTT (5 mg/mL) is added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Next,
violet formazan is added and dissolved in 500 mL of sodium dodecyl
sulfate solution in dimethylformamide and water mixture. The cell
viability is determined considering 100% cell viability for cells
without M1.

Image Analysis
Cells are first incubated
with 20 mg/mL
of M1 for 3 h, followed by treatment with 20 mg/mL AsO2– for 3 h at room temperature, and images are captured
at 30 min interval of incubation (Figure 16). After exposed to AsO2– ion, a bright green fluorescence is observed from
cells, as shown in Figure 16b,c. Cells exposed to only AsO2– display no fluorescence. Figure 16 indicates that M1 is cell-permeable to stain AsO2– without any harm.

Mo(VI) Enrichment
L is used for selective and quantitative
extraction of Mo(VI). Different solvents like CH3COOC2H5, CHCl3, CCl4, and dichloromethane
(DCM) are tested for optimum extraction efficiency (Figure 17). The L has high Mo(VI) extraction
efficiency in ethyl acetate76−79 (Figure 18). The distribution coefficient is calculated using the equation D = CM (org)/CM (aq), where CM (org) and CM (aq) are concentrations of Mo(VI) in organic
and aqueous phase after extraction. The results are briefly presented
in Table 1.

Solid-Phase Extractive
Removal of Arsenite Using Silica-Immobilized
M1
The immobilization of M1 on silica (100–200 mesh)
is performed following the literature procedure.78,51−54 The mixture of M1 (0.65 g) and silica (7.3 g) is refluxed for 3
h in MeOH. After removal of solvent, the color of M1-immobilized silica
becomes light orange. A glass column (10 cm × 1 cm) is packed
with the immobilized M1 with a bed volume of 12 mL. After passing
the solution of AsO2–, the color of the
column turns yellow, indicating sorption of AsO2– by immobilized M1. Figure S27 (SI) illustrates
the shift in wavenumber of the characteristic functional groups supporting
sorption of AsO2– on silica-immobilized
M1. The absence of IR bands at 3212 (−NH moiety), 1654, and
1619 cm–1 indicates sorption of AsO2–. Figure S28 (SI) clearly
demonstrates the difference in surface morphologies of silica-immobilized
M1 before and after sorption of AsO2–.51−53 The scanning electron microscopy images indicate growth at surface
of the silica beads after sorption of AsO2– (b) that are absent in (a). Table 2 indicates that immobilized M1 is very efficient to
remove AsO2– from its reservoir.

Determination of AsO2– in Real
Water Samples
The developed method2a,16 has been used for determination of AsO2– using M1 in real water samples (Table 3). To evaluate the accuracy of the method,
recovery studies have been performed at different concentration levels
by addition of a known amount of arsenite to industrial water sample,
collected from Durgapur-Asansol industrial area, West Bengal, India. Tables 3 and 4 indicate excellent recoveries of arsenite from tap and industry
water samples. Similarly, using C1, the amount of H2PO4– in drinking water and fertilizer is estimated
(Table 5). Figure S29 (SI) allows determination of AsO2– in real samples.67,79

Conclusions
An amide–imine conjugate is exploited
as a ratiometric probe
for nanomolar detection of Mo(VI) ion. The sensing mechanism involves
hydrogen-bond-assisted CHEF process at the cost of PET inhibition.
The Mo(VI) recognition is associated with 17-fold fluorescence enhancement.
The Mo(VI) binding event is confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
of the resulting Mo(VI) complex (M1). Further, M1 selectively recognizes
arsenite through green emission of the resultant adduct (C1) with
81-fold fluorescence enhancement. Interestingly, dihydrogen phosphate
induces dissociation of C1 back to free weakly fluorescent L. The
lowest detection limits are 1.5 × 10–8 M for
Mo(VI), 1.2 × 10–10 M for AsO2–, and 3.2 × 10–6 M for H2PO4–, whereas the corresponding
association constants are 4.21 × 105 M–1, 6.49 × 104 M–1, and 2.11 ×
105 M–1. All of the interactions have
been substantiated by TD-DFT calculations to rationalize their spectroscopic
properties. The L efficiently enriches Mo(VI) from aqueous solution
while M1 removes AsO2– from environmental
samples by solid-phase extraction.
