Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) found their well-deserved
position in the field of gas adsorption and separation because of
their unique properties. The separation of xenon from different gas
mixtures containing this valuable and essential noble gas is also
benefited from the exciting nature of MOFs. In this research, we chose
a series of isoreticular MOFs as our study models to apply advanced
molecular simulation techniques in the context of xenon separation
from air. We investigated the separation performance of our model
set through simulation of ternary gas adsorption isotherms and consequent
calculation of separation performance descriptors, finding out that
IRMOF-7 shows better recovering capabilities compared to the other
studied MOFs. We benefited from visualization of xenon energy
landscape within MOFs to obtain valuable information on possible reasoning
behind our observations. We also examined temperature-based separation
performance boosting strategy. Additionally, we noted that although
promising candidates are present among the studied MOFs for xenon
recovery from air, they are not suitable for xenon recovery from exhaled
anesthetic gas mixture.

1 Introduction
Since
their emergence,1,2 metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), an exciting class of advanced materials, have attracted
enormous attention among academic and industrial sections because
of their unique properties such as high surface area, modularity in
synthesis, and tunable pore structure,3 which consequently make them promising for a wide range of applications
including not only in gas storage/separation4−6 but also in
catalysis,7,8 drug delivery,9,10 hazardous
compound elimination,11 and electronic
devices.12 Although reticular chemistry
behind the design of MOFs provides their interesting aspect, which
is the possibility of constructing thousands of MOFs, it makes their
study for a specific application challenging. In this regard, one
could either benefit from in silico high-throughput screening to find
suitable MOFs for desired applications such as methane13/hydrogen storage14 and carbon dioxide separation15−19 or select an established set of MOFs sharing common features and
investigate them to obtain information on the molecular level to use
them as a starting point for future computational and experimental
studies.20−28 In this research, we benefit from the latter approach to accomplish
our objectives.

The xenon (Xe) separation from gas mixtures
containing this expensive
gas using MOFs is one of the exciting and relevant topics that was
the subject of several accomplished studies29 to provide Xe for several medical30−32 and characterization33−36 usages. However, as stated in an earlier publication by our group,20 the worldwide usage of xenon is limited because
of the high prices arising from energy-intensive cryogenic distillation,
which is the dominant procedure for xenon production. An excellent
alternative for the development of the xenon production units based
on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or membrane-based separation is
MOFs, which have been covered by interesting results published by
several research groups that mainly deal with the xenon separation
from the Xe/Kr mixture.37−42 For instance, Anderson et al. recently published an interesting
paper43 on the application of molecular
simulations to the membrane-based Kr/Xe separation, where they quantified
the effect of temperature on the separation process and revealed that
a lower temperature improves the Kr/Xe separation performance of studied
membranes. Thallapally and his co-workers recently published a comprehensive
review paper29 that covers nearly all related
publications dealing with this issue. However, another alternative
resource for xenon can be xenon/air mixture, which could be very beneficial
from both the economic and energy sustainability point of view.29,44

In this research, we have benefited from advanced molecular
simulation
techniques to explore a set of isoreticular MOFs for recovering xenon
at room temperature. This set of IRMOFs that was first reported45 in 2002 represents a well-established class
of MOFs that fits very well to serve as a model to investigate the
effect of different organic linkers on specific separation performance.
The gas adsorption characteristics of IRMOF-1 to 16 are assessed by
simulating ternary gas mixtures and using the results to calculate
corresponding separation performance parameters. We also investigated
the process by more detailed atomistic molecular simulation data including
the heat of adsorption and energy surface landscapes to get deeper
insight into our separation process of interest, and finally, we explored
the possible boosting by an affordable alteration of the operation
condition.

2 Results and Discussion
We calculated
the pore limiting diameter (PLD) and the largest
cavity diameter (LCD) of MOFs (Table S1) to select the ones that could accommodate gas mixture components
on the basis of their kinetic diameters (Xe: 3.96 Å, N2: 3.64 Å, and O2: 3.46 Å), resulting in the
exclusion of IRMOF-4 (PLD: 3.35 Å) and IRMOF-5 (PLD: 1.72 Å)
from further investigations. To assess the separation performance,
we initially simulated the gas uptake of each MOF in contact with
a ternary mixture of Xe (10%), N2 (70%), and O2 (20%); then, we calculated various parameters reported in Table 1 to quantify the xenon
separation capability of studied MOFs.

The xenon uptake
at adsorption pressure (NXeads) reflects the
ability of each MOF to adsorb xenon from the mixture. IRMOF-7 provides
the highest uptake (4.84 cm3(STP) cm–3), which is ∼10 times greater than that of IRMOF-16 (0.56
cm3(STP) cm–3). Because solid adsorbents
are used in a cyclic process of adsorption and desorption, the investigation
of the delivery characteristics of MOFs in the process is also needed.
Therefore, we calculated the working capacity of xenon (ΔNXe) for each MOF, which is equal to (NXeads – NXedes). IRMOF-7 also provides a promising value
of 4.37 cm3(STP) cm–3, which shows that
its performance is almost 35% better than that of the second-ranked
IRMOF-6 and almost 90% better than that of IRMOF-16. The next important
parameter is the adsorption selectivity (αi/j), which is calculated using eq 1 from the amount of mixture components
in adsorbed (x) and gas (y) phases. 1  where i and j denote Xe and (N2 or O2), respectively.
We
observe that in spite of having a range of different values among
studied MOFs, all are xenon-selective at an operation condition and
no selectivity inversion occurs. In passing, IRMOF-7 outperforms other
MOFs by showing better Xe selectivity toward both N2 and
O2. It is also noteworthy that although the major component
of the gas mixture is N2, all studied adsorbents show a
slightly higher αXe/N2 compared to αXe/O2. However, to have a conclusive ranking of
studied MOFs for the separation process of interest, we considered
using the multiparameter adsorbent performance indictor (API) developed
by Wiersum et al.46 calculated using eq 2. 2  where
ΔHads (kJ mol–1) is the xenon enthalpy of adsorption
along with the other parameters explained earlier in the text. As
we are dealing with a purification case, we assumed A, B, and C exponents from ref (46) to be the same and equal
to 1. RASPA developers have implemented the fluctuation method47 to calculate ΔHads using eq 3. 3  where R, T, U, N, and brackets are the gas
constant, temperature, energy, number of particles, and ensemble average,
respectively. Table 1 also gives the calculated values for ΔHads,Xe and API. We observe that IRMOF-7 is conclusively the
top-performing MOF above IRMOF-6 with APIN2 of
2.24 and 1.99, respectively; even the former suffers from the negative
effect of higher enthalpy of adsorption. We subsequently studied structures
in more detail to have better insight.

In this regard, Figures 1 and S1–S9 illustrate simulated
ternary adsorption isotherms up to 1 bar. We note that IRMOF-7 shows
higher xenon uptake in comparison to the nitrogen and oxygen uptake
in the whole pressure range, which is consistent with the above discussion;
despite having more N2 in the gas mixture, IRMOF-7 uptakes
more xenon. It also reveals that between N2 and O2, the former is adsorbed more actively in all studied MOFs, suggesting
that Xe/N2 separation can be considered as the challenging
part rather than the Xe/O2 one.

Figure 1 Simulated adsorption
isotherms of Xe (0.1), N2 (0.7),
and O2 (0.2) ternary mixture on IRMOF-7 at 298 K.

Afterward, we studied the isosteric
heat of adsorption (Qst = −ΔHads) of each component of the ternary mixture
to obtain an overview
on the observed separation performances from a different point of
view (Figures 2 and S10–S12). These plots generally exhibit
a plateau trend for all studied gaseous species. This reveals that
gas molecules are facing energetically homogenous adsorption surfaces
within the structures, which can be related to the relatively large
pores within the studied MOFs. This is also in good agreement with
the ternary adsorption isotherms showing an increasing linear trend
that implies that all MOFs are far from being saturated by adsorbates.

Figure 2 Calculated
(a) isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst)
for Xe within Xe/N2/O2 ternary
mixture and (b) ΔQst (Qst(Xe) – Qst(N2)) at 298 K.

We also benefited from another descriptor, ΔQst, of Xe and N2 (Figure 2b) or O2 (Figure S12) to investigate its effect on the
obtained trends.
We observed that IRMOF-7 is completely separated from the rest of
MOFs by having ΔQst of ∼7
kJ mol–1. We can suggest that having a large ΔQst can be a beneficial factor for high separation
performance.

We calculated and visualized the energy surface
landscapes associated
with xenon and plotted them at different isocontour levels in Figures 3 and S13–S21 to complement the previous discussion.
The gray surface (0 K energy) illustrates the pore walls for xenon
adsorption, and we observe that it is almost apparent within a whole
unit cell of IRMOF-7 (Figure 3a), whereas IRMOF-16 (Figure 3b) lacks it because of having large pores. Two other
energy surface landscapes at lower isocontour levels (green: ∼−12.5
kJ mol–1 and violet: −16.5 kJ mol–1; the latter is close to the lowest energy) reveal the possible xenon
adsorption sites within the MOFs. It is noteworthy that the surface
is distorted in IRMOF-7 because of the presence of 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid moieties oriented toward the pores, which results in the formation
of an inhomogeneous energy surface at the corners, providing more
favorable interaction sites for xenon atoms, and it can be the possible
reason behind observing better performance for this particular MOF.
In the other MOFs, the energy surfaces are mostly homogenous surrounding
the metal nodes and corners (Figures S13–S21).

values of 0 (gray), −12.5 kJ mol–1 (green),
and −16.5 kJ mol–1 (violet).

In the final part of our study, we have considered
the effect of
a possible performance-boosting strategy, i.e., temperature decrease
to 273 K. We plotted API-related correlation plots in Figure 4. We observe that we could
enhance the API by a factor of ∼2.5 by reducing the temperature
to 273 K (Figure 4a).
This also reveals that the temperature-assisted boosting had more
influence on working capacity (Figure 4c, enhanced by ∼1.9 times), followed by selectivity
(Figure 4b, enhanced
by ∼1.3 times). It is noteworthy that temperature decrease
does not show a significant effect on ΔHads and therefore regeneration of occupied adsorption sites
should not become an issue.

3 Conclusions and Prospects
We successfully
implemented state-of-the-art molecular simulation
techniques to investigate IRMOF-1 to 16 for the room temperature xenon
separation from air. Our study showed that IRMOF-7 is the top-performing
one among the studied MOFs. We examined the systems in more detail
by visualizing the xenon energy landscape within the MOFs, and it
revealed that IRMOF-7 benefits from the presence of 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid linker, which is oriented toward the pores. It consequently generated
an inhomogeneous energy surface for xenon. We, then, examined the
effect of temperature lowering on the separation performance and found
that not only the API can be enhanced 2.5 times but also while the
working capacity, followed by selectivity, is influenced, the heat
of adsorption remains unchanged. Our findings within the context of
current research can be beneficial for designing future MOFs based
on the studied model compounds to deliver advanced MOFs, which can
provide xenon at a lower price and help the energy sustainability
by lowering the energy consumption.

4 Simulation
Details
We adopted the study set from 20 MOF structures reported
by Eddaoudi
et al.45 In their original paper, four
of MOFs (IRMOF-9, 11, 13, and 15) are doubly interpenetrated structures
associated with IRMOF-8, 10, 14, and 16, respectively, and we excluded
the former ones from our investigation. We calculated the PLD and
LCD of structures using Zeo++ (version 0.3)48 with a high-accuracy flag using implemented CSD atomic radius.

The gas adsorption isotherms were simulated using RASPA code49 (version 2.0.35) and via Grand Canonical Monte
Carlo50,51 (GCMC) approach. All of the structures were
considered rigid during simulations and taken from the shipped library
along with RASPA. Nonbonded interactions among adsorbates and framework
atoms were described using 12–6 Lennard–Jones and Coulomb
potentials by applying eq 4(50,51) 4  where i and j represent interacting atoms and r corresponds to
their distance. σ and ε are L–J well depth and
diameter, respectively. q denotes the partial charge
of atoms, and ε0 is the dielectric constant. Partial
atomic charges were calculated using extended charge equilibration
(EQeq) method using default values.52,53 A 12.8 Å
cutoff was used to truncate the energies without being shifted and
tail correction. Cross-term L–J parameters were calculated
through Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules.50 The Ewald summation technique with a precision of 1 ×
10–6 was used to model long-range electrostatic
interactions. The force field parameters for framework atoms were
all taken from universal force field.54 Gas molecules were modeled using TraPPE force field parameters55,56 except xenon, which was taken from Potoff et al.57 The simulations included 5 × 105 MC cycles
at each pressure point with the first half for equilibration and the
remaining for the production run. An MC cycle consists of n steps, which is the highest number between 20 and the
number of molecules at the beginning of each given simulation point.
The Peng–Robinson equation of state was used to convert pressure
to fugacity during the calculations.49 The
insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, and identity-change MC
trial moves were used in all GCMC calculations. We have validated
our simulation setup in our previous publications.20,21 The energy surface landscapes were calculated and visualized using
iRASPA.58 Considering the purpose of this
research, we adopted the separation condition from a recent publication44 in which 1:9 molar ratio was used for the Xe/air
mixture. Because we were interested in exploring our set of model
MOFs for vacuum PSA, we slightly modified the adsorption and desorption
pressures to 1.0 and 0.1 bar, respectively. We performed the simulations
at 298 and 273 K.
