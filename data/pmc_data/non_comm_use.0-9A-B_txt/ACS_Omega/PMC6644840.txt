This work unraveled kinetics, isotherm,
and thermodynamic properties
of methylene blue (MB) adsorbed on polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole
(PPY). The two polymers, PANI and PPY, synthesized by a facile C-dot
(CD)-initiated polymerization method have been proven as the effective
adsorbent materials to remove MB from wastewater. This dye model is
also generally employed as a redox indicator in analytical chemistry
and exhibits blue in an oxidizing environment, but it is colorless
when exposed to a reducing agent. The effects of temperature, adsorbent
amount contact time, and dye concentration were consistently examined.
The adsorption capacity of the polymers at 28 °C could reach
19.2 mg/g. The adsorption equilibrium of the dye was attained after
90 and 120 min of contact time with PANI and PPY, respectively. The
equilibrium details were well described by Freundlich and Langmuir
isotherms. Results showed that PANI and PPY prepared using CD-initiated
polymerization are better adsorbents compared to the commercial PANI
powder for the removal of MB from water.

1 Introduction
Polymer materials have
attracted significant attention for different
applications including dye removal1−4 and remediation because of their high thermal
stability, adsorption capacity, and chemical stability. A recent novel
polymerization method of polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPY)
used carbon dots (CDs) and UV light, avoiding the regular oxidation
initiators.5 In fact, CDs play a major
role as an initiator. There are many organic and inorganic dyes that
are currently used in industrial leather, plastic, textile, pulp and
paper making, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and printing.6 However, despite their beneficial use, such dyes
are poisonous and harmful to humans and the environment. Dyes used
in these industries must have high photocatalytic and chemical stability;
therefore, the biological and biodegradable treatment of these dyes
is too difficult. Different types of dyes used by the textile industry
are discharged into waste streams, causing a serious problem for the
environment.7 Considering various treatment
methods to degrade dyes, the resultant degradation products are still
poisonous, teratogenic, and carcinogenic for living organisms. Thus,
such unwanted color dyes and their disruption products are also carcinogenic
to human beings.8 Moreover, there are many
physical, chemical, and biological techniques used to remove dyes
from an aqueous solution.9 Nevertheless,
these methods always show few disadvantages such as energy intensiveness,
long time process, high cost, and toxicity.10 To our knowledge, the adsorption process is an economic, effective,
and easily operated process.11 Several
inorganic and organic adsorbent materials have been used to remove
dyes from an aqueous solution.12,13 However, such adsorbent
materials always suffer from problems in the separation, forming byproducts
and reproduce from wastewater.

Some reports pertain to the adsorption
properties of polymer-based
nanomaterials such as pyrrole-based materials,14 PANI nanotubes,15 polydopamine,16−18 PANI-based silica composite,19 nanocrystalline
cellulose,8 and bioadsorbents.20−25 In this regard, PANI and PPY can be used as adsorbent materials
because of their good chemical and thermal stability, good morphologies,
low cost, and ease of synthesis. The adsorption of methylene blue
(MB) on PANI and PPY as a working model was conducted under varying
adsorption conditions to decipher kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherms
of the adsorption process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorption of MB by PANI and PPY
The absorbance of
MB after the addition of 0.05 g of PANI and PPY
to a 50 mg L–1 solution of MB as a function of time
is depicted in Figure 1a,b. The figure reveals a decrease in the absorbance of MB as a function
of time. As shown in Figure 1a, the difference in the adsorption of MB between PANI and
PPY is small, except that the concentration of MB is almost completely
reduced by PANI in 90 min, compared to 120 min for PPY. In Figure 1c, the addition of
0.05 g of commercial PANI (ES) to 50 mg L–1 of MB
solution results in no change in the initial absorbance even after
120 min into the experiment.

Figure 1 Time-resolved adsorption spectra of the MB dye
(20 mL of 50 mg
L–1) with 0.05 g of PANI material (a), time-resolved
adsorption spectra of MB dye (20 mL of mg L–1) with
0.05 g of PPY (b), and time-resolved adsorption spectra of MB dye
(20 mL of mg L–1) with 0.05 g commercial PANI emeraldine
salt (c).

The explanation for the difference
in the adsorption of MB by the
commercial PANI and the CD-synthesized polymer is related to the size
and shape of the two polymers (Figure 2b,a). The structure of the CD-initiated PANI product
reveals a mixture of nanotubes whose diameters are in the 70–500
nm range (Figure 2a)
and many flat micron-sized irregular structures. The commercial PANI
reveals large clusters (15 μm) built of flat particles of 1–2
μm size (Figure 2b). The highly aggregated structure limits the free surface area
for adsorbing molecules, while the long narrow tubes expose a large
surface area for adsorbing the MB molecules. The transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 2c) of CD-initiated PANI shows that most of the materials are
in the form of nanoparticles, and only a few nanotubes of PANI were
observed. Figure 2d
shows the TEM image of PPY, which shows spherical-shaped nanoparticles
20–60 nm in diameter.

PPY synthesis.

2.2 Adsorption
Studies
The MB aqueous
solutions were prepared by mixing MB in water and diluted with deionized
water to form a series of desired concentrations. The adsorption capacity
was calculated using eq 1, where (q) is the amount of MB adsorbed per unit
mass of PANI and PPY. The dye removal efficiency (R) was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 1   2  where V (L) represents the
volume of MB and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent (PANI and PPY). Co and Ct (mg L–1) are the initial and final concentrations (after adsorption) of
MB solution, respectively.

For the study of adsorption kinetics,
20 mL of the stock solution of MB is added to 0.05 g of PANI or PPY
with an initial concentration of 50 mg L–1 in a
100 mL beaker at 28 °C until the system reaches the adsorption
equilibrium with different time periods. The concentration of MB suspension
in supernatant solutions was used to calculate q at
equilibrium. The adsorption capacity of MB onto the polymer is represented
in Figure 3a,b, and
the removal efficiency of MB with the contact time is depicted in Figure 3c,d. The PANI material
completely removes MB from the aqueous solution in 90 min, and the
MB removal efficiency reaches up to 96%, as shown in Figure 3c, whereas the PPY material
removes it in 120 min and the MB removal efficiency reaches up to
97%. This shows that synthesized PANI and PPY materials have superior
adsorption properties with respect to the metal oxide system.26,27

Figure 3 (a,b)
Results of the removal of MB as a function of the contact
time. The adsorption capacity of MB (50 mg L–1)
onto PANI and PPY (0.05 g) (c,d) is found.

2.3 Adsorption Mechanism for MB onto PANI
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of PANI and PANI–MB
are shown in Figure 4. The absorption peak of PANI at 3334 cm–1 is assigned
to the stretching vibration of the amine, and the peak at 1577 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the aromatic
ring. The peak at 1505 cm–1 is attributed to the
N–H sharing vibration, and the peak at 1340 cm–1 is attributed to the C–N stretching vibration. The FTIR spectrum
of PANI–MB displays various changes. The intensity of the band
at 3334 cm–1 of the PANI–MB spectrum is considerably
reduced, indicating that the amine plays a major role in the adsorption
process. The peak at 1577 cm–1 is shifted to a higher
frequency and that at 1340 cm–1 is shifted to a
lower frequency. The peak at 1577 cm–1 that is assigned
to the aromatic rings is shifted to 1602 cm–1 after
the adsorption of the MB. These changes may be due to the following
reasons. The surface of the adsorbent material exposes the amine groups
on the PANI, serving as the adsorption sites for the interaction with
MB. Because MB is a planar aromatic molecule and PANI also has many
aromatic rings, the π–π stacking interactions could
occur between PANI and MB, displaying the shift of the absorption
peak at 1577 cm–1, which is assigned to the aromatic
moiety. The electrostatic interactions are the driving forces of the
adsorption of cationic MB onto the basic sites of PANI.

of PANI and PANI–MB.

2.4 Adsorption Kinetics
Kinetics studies
on the adsorption of MB were conducted at 28 °C. Because the
kinetics information can provide knowledge on the mechanism and the
adsorption rate, carrying out all the experiments at a fixed temperature
is essential. Figure 5a,b and c,d shows the pseudo-first- and −second-order kinetics
models for the adsorption process of MB on PANI and PPY. Both models
in linear forms can be presented as follows 3   4  where qt and qe mg/g represent the amount of
MB (adsorbed
at equilibrium), and k1 (min–1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-first-order model, and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) is the pseudo-second-order model rate constant. The kinetic parameters
such as k1, k2, correlation coefficients, and calculated qe,cal values are resolved by a linear equation, as shown in Table 1. The qe,cal values of both models are in agreement with the
experimental data, where qe (18.7 mg/g)
is for PANI and qe (16.1 mg/g) for PPY.

model of PANI and PPY, and (e,f) intraparticle diffusion kinetic plot

 	Ki2 = 0.34 mg/g min1/2	 	Ki2 = 1.18 mg/g min1/2	 	
The adsorption process is also studied
using the Weber and Morris
intraparticle diffusion model. In this model, if intraparticle diffusion
is the rate-controlling factor, the uptake of the adsorbate varies
with the square root of adsorption time. The diffusion model is revealed
in eq 5. 5  

The adsorption steps are related to the intercept, which represents
the intercept of C (mg/g), and ki (mg/g min–1/2) is the diffusion rate
constant. Figure 5e,f
shows a multilinear plot of the intraparticle diffusion process of
the MB adsorption process on PANI and PPY. Figure 5 indicates two steps that take place during
the adsorption process. The first stage indicates the film diffusion
model, which is the diffusion of MB from the solution to the external
surface of PANI and PPY, and the second step can be attributed to
the intraparticle diffusion stage because of the gradual adsorption
on the surface of PANI and PPY. As shown in Figure 5e,f, the slope (ki) of the intraparticle diffusion stage is smaller than that of the
film diffusion stage. This result indicates that the intraparticle
diffusion stage is a gradual process. The high values of C indicate that the additional mass transfer of MB molecules onto
PANI and PPY is significant in the sorption method and occurs in the
initial adsorption.

2.5 Adsorption Isotherms
The models of
the adsorption isotherms are investigated to provide the detailed
facts about the surface adsorbent material properties of the polymers
and the adsorption nature. The dynamic concept of adsorption equilibrium
is found as soon as the rate of the dye adsorption process is equal
to the desorption rate. The observed data of methylene adsorption
onto PANI and PPY are fitted to the Freundlich and Langmuir models
(Figures 6a–d).
In the Langmuir model, the adsorption occurs on a monolayer in all
adsorption sites because the adsorbent surface is homogeneous.16 In contrast, the Freundlich adsorption assumes
that the multilayer adsorption process is localized to a heterogeneous
surface. The linear equations of the two models are presented as follows 6   7  where q0 (mg/g)
and KL (L/mg) are the Langmuir constants
in adsorption capacity and adsorption rate, respectively. In the case
of the Freundlich adsorption isotherm, n and KF are the constants. The Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms of PANI and PPY are shown in Figure 6. The values of KL, q0, KF,
and n are determined from the isotherms and the values
are shown in Table 2. The R2 value of the Freundlich and
Langmuir model is 1 and 0.98, respectively, validating their applicability.
The monolayer adsorption value determined from the Langmuir isotherm
is 19.67 (mg/g) for PANI and 19.96 (mg/g) for PPY, which is in agreement
with the experimental data (19 mg/g). These results indicate that
the adsorption of MB onto PANI and PPY follows the isotherms models.

Figure 6 (a,b)
Langmuir and (c,d) Freundlich isotherm models for the adsorption
of MB onto PANI and PPY.

 	KF = 2.1 L/mg	 	KF = 1.2 L/mg	 	
The adsorption feasibility is evaluated by the Langmuir isotherm
separation factor (RL). It is calculated
using eq 8. 8  where KL (L/mg)
is the Langmuir constant and Co (mg L–1) is the initial MB concentration. The results of RL signify the type of the isotherm; favorable
(0 < RL < 1), irreversible (RL = 0), unfavorable (RL > 1), and linear (RL = 1).
The
determined RL value of MB adsorption onto
PANI and PPY is 0.285 and 0.266, respectively, indicating a favorable
adsorption isotherm.

2.6 Thermodynamic Analysis
The temperature
studies of the MB adsorption process are shown in Figure 7. The experiments were measured
using 50 mg of PANI or PPY in 20 mL of the initial concentration of
MB at different temperatures (20–50 °C), with a fixed
contact time of 40 min. The removal efficiency of MB increases when
the temperature is increased to 50 °C. The measurements require
that the adsorption process of MB on PANI and PPY is preferred at
higher temperatures within the temperature range that both PANI and
PPY can be judged as a highly efficient adsorbent material to remove
MB from water. This result can be ascribed to the evidence that there
will be many adsorption sites for MB at higher temperatures. The basic
thermodynamic parameters of enthalpy (ΔH0), entropy (ΔS0), and Gibbs
free energy (ΔG0) for the MB adsorption
process were calculated by using the Langmuir isotherm using the following
equations.17 9   10  where R is the universal
gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the system temperature
(K), and KL is the Langmuir equilibrium
constant (L/mol). The entropy and enthalpy change are determined from
van’t Hoff plots of ln(KL) versus
1/T (Figure 7b). All thermodynamic parameters are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Thermodynamic Parameters
 	T (K)	ΔG0 (kJ/mol)	ΔH0 (kJ/mol)	ΔS0 (J/mol K)	
PANI	293, 303, 313, 323	–6.6,
−6.8, −7.4, −8.1	17	120	
PPY	293, 303, 313, 323	–5.8, −6.4, −6.8, −7.7	17.2	112	
The negative ΔG0 values of PANI
and PPY (−6.6, −6.8, −7.4, −8.1 and −5.8,
−6.4, −6.8, −7.7 at 293, 303, 313, and 323) confirm
that the adsorption process is spontaneous in nature and is also feasible.16 The positive ΔH0 values of PANI and PPY are 17 and 17.2 kJ/mol, which suggest that
the MB adsorption process is endothermic, which is consistent with
the effect of temperature. The positive ΔS0 values of PANI and PPY, 120 and 112 (J/mol K), depicted some
structural changes in the polymer and MB, increasing the randomness
at the solid–liquid interface during the adsorption process.

3 Conclusions
Micrometric and nanometric particles
of PANI and PPY were prepared
using a one-step CD-mediated polymerization reaction. These polymers
were examined for kinetic studies on MB adsorption. The results demonstrated
that MB adsorption depends on the initial concentration, contact time,
and temperature. In the kinetics studies, the adsorption equilibrium
data were well fitted with the pseudo-first-order and -second-order
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, respectively. Weber’s intraparticle
diffusion studies determined two-stage steps that took place while
the adsorption process occurred, and it was not the rate-determining
step. The thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of MB
onto PANI and PPY was spontaneous (ΔG0; −6.8 and −6.4 at 303 K) and endothermic (ΔH0: 17 and 17.2 kJ/mol). The adsorbent capacities
of facile CD-initiated polymers of PANI and PPY were 19.2 and 19.31
mg/g, compared to 5.01 and 5.7 mg/g for the PANI base15 and the PANI/silica composite, respectively.19 Thus, CD-initiated polymers of PANI and PPY
are good adsorbent materials compared to the PANI base and the PANI/silica
composite for the removal of MB from aqueous solution.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Polyethylene
glycol (PEG)-400,
nitric acid, pyrrole, aniline, MB, and PANI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Israel.

4.2 Preparation of CDs
The preparation
of water-soluble CDs was achieved via a modified sonochemical method
using PEG-400, as described previously.28 Briefly, 30 mL of PEG-400 was poured into a 100 mL beaker and incubated
in an oil bath at 70 °C. The tip of an ultrasonic transducer
was dipped in the PEG and sonicated for 3 h with 65% amplitude.

4.3 Synthesis of PANI and PPY
The syntheses
of PANI and PPY followed our previous report.5 Aniline (1 g) was mixed in 30 mL of 1.5 M nitric acid in a 100 mL
beaker to start the oxidation at room temperature (RT). After the
addition of CDs (3 mL), the resulting solution was subject to UV irradiation
for 1 week. The brown powder was collected using filtration, washed
many times with water, and dried at RT.5 Similarly, pyrrole (1.0 g) was mixed in 30 mL of 1 M nitric acid
in a 100 mL beaker at RT. CD solution (3 mL) was added. The polymerization
reaction was carried out by illumination with UV for 3 days, resulting
in a brown powder. The powder was collected using filtration, washed
many times with water, and dried at RT.5

4.4 MB Adsorption
The stock solution
was prepared as follows: 50 mg of MB was dissolved in 1 L of distilled
water. The concentration (initial and final) of MB solutions was analyzed
by UV–visible spectroscopy. The kinetic measurements were studied
in the following condition: 28 °C, a fixed concentration of MB,
and neutral pH (6.5) without any external adjustment. MB (20 mL) of
various concentrations was added to 0.05 g of PPY and PANI and stirred
at 1600 rpm by a magnetic stirrer for different contact times. The
suspensions of the adsorbent and MB solutions were separated by a
syringe. The concentrations of the MB suspension of the supernatant
solution after different time periods (5–120 min) were measured
by a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The chemical structures
of PANI and PPY are depicted in Scheme 1.

4.5 Analytical
Technique
The polymer
materials were characterized by various analytical techniques—FTIR
spectra, 13C solid-state NMR spectra, thermogravimetric
analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results of all these
characterization methods are already reported in ref (5). UV–visible spectroscopic
analyses were conducted at a maximum wavelength of 665 nm of the absorption
MB to determine the concentration of MB based on a prepared absorption
curve of MB. UV–visible spectra of MB adsorption onto PANI
and PPY were analyzed using a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian)
operated by Lab Sphere software.
