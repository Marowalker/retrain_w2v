Membrane capacitive
deionization (MCDI) is a simple and highly
energy efficient method to convert brackish water to clean water.
In this work, a high-performance MCDI electrode architecture, which
is composed of three-dimensional graphene networks and metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs)–derived porous carbon rods, was prepared
by a facile method. The obtained electrode material possesses not
only the conducting networks for rapid electron transport but also
the short diffusion length of ions, which exhibits excellent desalination
performance with a high salt removal capacity, i.e., 37.6 mg g–1 at 1.2 V in 1000 mg L–1 NaCl solution.
This strategy can be extended to other MOF-derived MCDI electrodes.

Introduction
The shortage of fresh
water has emerged as a global challenge nowadays.
Capacitive deionization (CDI), a novel water purification technique,
has attracted increasing attention due to its low cost and high energy
efficiency.1 In the CDI process, an electrical
potential is applied across two porous carbon (PC) electrodes and
salt ions can be adsorbed and stored by forming the electrical double
layers (EDL) on the electrodes. However, the ions adsorbed on the
electrode simultaneously expel the co-ions during the adsorption process,
which leads to a decreased desalination efficiency.2−6 An effective way to alleviate such a problem is to
integrate the ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) with typical CDI systems
to construct a membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI).7−10 The MCDI has exhibited enhanced performance in terms of the electrosorption
capacity as well as charge efficiency.11−15

Based on the working principle of MCDI, its
performance strongly
depends on the properties of electrode materials. In theory, the electrode
materials are supposed to have high electrical conductivity, hierarchically
porous structure, good wettability, and large surface areas.16 Various carbon materials have been investigated
as electrode materials, such as graphene,17−24 carbon nanofibers,25−27 mesoporous carbon,28−30 carbon nanotubes,31 carbon aerogels,32,33 and carbon
composites.34−37 Until now, many efforts have been devoted to design novel electrode
materials to further improve the desalination capacity and efficiency.

Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a type of porous
crystals with ordered pore structure, have been demonstrated as versatile
precursors for the synthesis of porous carbon (PC).38−40 Due to its
high specific surface area and porosity, MOF-derived PC holds great
promise for high-performance CDI electrodes.41−47 For instance, Pan et al. reported that a PC electrode obtained via
pyrolysis of ZIF-8 showed a high desalination capacity of 13.86 mg
g–1.48 Our recent work
demonstrated that the PC, prepared by using bimetallic MOFs as a precursor,
delivered an excellent desalination capacity of 45.62 mg g–1 when used as MCDI electrodes.49 However,
MOF-derived PC electrodes usually suffer from poor electrical conductivity
due to the low crystallinity of the MOF-derived carbon.50,51 Incorporating graphene into MOF-derived PC is an efficient strategy
to further improve the electron transport.52,53

In this work, we report a novel and high-performance MCDI
electrode
based on a hierarchically porous carbon composite, which is constructed
by an interconnecting three-dimensional (3D) graphene network and
MOF-derived porous carbon rods/reduced graphene oxide (PC/rGO). The
fabricated PC/rGO composite electrode exhibits excellent desalination
performance, e.g., 37.6 mg g–1 at 1.2 V in 1000
mg L–1 NaCl solution.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 illustrates
the synthetic process of MOF-derived porous carbon/reduced graphene
oxide (PC/rGO) composites. The presynthesized Fe–MOF crystals
(Figure S1) are quickly added into GO solution
and vigorously mixed for 5 min (Scheme 1, step 1). In this process, Fe–MOF crystals
and GO nanosheets are immediately self-assembled into a 3D structure.
This is a result of the break in the charge balance of GO dispersion.
After a freeze-dry process, Fe–MOF/GO composite aerogels are
obtained (Scheme 1,
step 2). The prepared Fe–MOF/GO composites are subjected to
the subsequent annealing and etching process, which results in the
formation of PC/rGO composites (Scheme 1, steps 3 and 4). To investigate the optimal composition
of PC/rGO composites used for MCDI electrode, a series of Fe–MOF/GO
composite aerogels were obtained by adjusting the weight ratios of
Fe–MOF to GO. The obtained Fe–MOF/GO composite aerogels
are designated as Fe–MOF/GO-n and their derived
porous carbon/graphene composites are designated as PC/rGO-n, where n stands for the weight ratio
of Fe–MOF to GO. For comparison, Fe–MOF-derived PC and
rGO aerogel were also prepared.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Synthetic
Process of PC/rGO Composites
The morphology of the as-prepared Fe–MOF/GO-20
composite
and its derived PC/rGO-20 composite was characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1a shows a 3D structure
constructed by rodlike Fe–MOF crystals and interconnected GO
nanosheets, in which Fe–MOF crystals were well dispersed on
the GO nanosheets. Some wrinkles were observed on the surface of Fe–MOF,
indicating that Fe–MOF rods are partially wrapped by GO nanosheets
with thin thickness. The characteristic peaks of Fe–MOF were
shown in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure S2),54 whereas the peak of GO (usually
at ∼10.5°) was not observed due to the low weight percentage
of GO in the composite.

After the annealing process, GO was reduced to
rGO and Fe-MOF/GO-20
composite was converted to a composite of Fe, Fe2O3, and rGO. This is confirmed by XRD characterization (Figure S3). The diffraction peaks corresponding
to (220), (311), (320), (421), (511), and (440) planes for Fe2O3 (JCPDS: 39-1346) were observed.55 In addition, the XRD pattern of the annealed Fe-MOF/GO-20 also
shows the (110), (200) peaks of Fe (JCPDS: 06-0696), indicates the
existence of Fe residues.56Figure 1b indicates the annealed Fe–MOF
crystals still preserve a rodlike shape similar to that of Fe–MOFs.
Some large particles with sizes of several hundred nanometers were
also observed on the annealed Fe–MOF crystals. The TEM observations
in Figure 1c are consistent
with SEM. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows a lattice distance
of ∼0.26 nm (inset of Figure 1c) corresponding to the (310) plane of Fe2O3.57

The PC/rGO-20 composite
was obtained after the subsequent etching
process of Fe/Fe2O3/rGO composite. Figure 1d shows the 3D structure
of PC/rGO-20 composite composed of interconnecting graphene networks
and rod-shaped PC. From a close-up view of the rod part in inset of Figure 1d, the large particles
were removed by acid, forming porous carbon rods. TEM images in Figure 1e,f indicate the
PC rod is highly porous with both micro- and nanosized pores. Moreover,
thin layers of rGO sheets were observed on the surface of a PC rod.
The XRD patterns of PC/rGO-20, PC, and rGO all present two broad peaks
at ∼25 and ∼44°, which can be indexed to the (002)
and (101) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure 2a). The obtained PC and PC/rGO-20
composite were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Figures 2b and S4) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
(Figure 2c,d). As shown
in Figure 2b, the two
characteristic peaks of graphene, i.e., D and G bands, were observed
in PC/rGO-20, indicating the presence of rGO.58 The increase in the intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) from 0.97 in Fe–MOF/GO-20
to 1.04 in PC/rGO-20 confirms the reduction of GO during the annealing
process. The XPS spectra of PC and PC/rGO-20 were presented in Figure 2c. Both samples show
the presence of C 1s peak at ∼283 eV, N 1s peak at ∼400
eV, and O 1s peak at ∼531 eV.35,59 There are
no Fe in the XPS spectra, which is consistent with the XRD results.
High-resolution N 1s spectrum suggests two main peaks at ∼397
and 400 eV, which correspond to pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, respectively
(Figure 2d).53

A series of PC/rGO-n composites (n = 10, 20, 30, and 40) derived from
Fe–MOF/GO composites with
different weight ratios of Fe–MOF to GO were also prepared
based on our method as described in Scheme 1 (Figure S5).
The surface areas of PC/rGO composites were further investigated by
N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. As shown
in Figure S6, the PC/rGO composites display
a type IV isotherm with sharp uptakes at low relative pressure (<0.05)
and H3 type hysteresis loops at high pressure, indicating the coexistence
of micropore and mesopore, respectively. Meanwhile, the rising curves
of N2 uptakes at higher pressure from 0.9 to 1.0 indicate
the existence of macropores, which is possibly contributed by the
void space among interconnected graphene sheets. The PC/rGO-20 composites
possess the largest specific surface area (713 m2 g–1) among all the PC/rGO-n composites.
This value is also significantly higher than those of PC and rGO (558
and 358 m2 g–1).

To evaluate the
electrochemical behavior of the obtained electrodes,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in 1 M NaCl solution with a
potential window of −0.4–0.6 V at various scan rates
from 2 to 100 mV s–1. The rectangular shape of CV
curve for a PC/rGO electrode suggests a typical electrical double-layer
capacitance behavior of electrodes (Figure 3a). As compared with other electrodes, including
the PC/rGO composites with varied compositions, PC and rGO electrodes,
PC/rGO-20 electrode exhibits the largest integrated area of CV curves
(Figure 3a and Figure S7). This is in agreement with the calculated
specific capacitances of all fabricated electrodes (Figure 3b,c). The PC/rGO-20 electrode
shows the highest specific capacitance among all the electrodes (218
F g–1 at 2 mV s–1). The optimal
combination of large specific surface area and high conductivity leads
to the enhanced performance of PC/rGO-20.

rate of 5 mV s–1 and
(b) specific capacitances under different scan rates of PC/rGO-10,

PC/rGO-20, PC/rGO-30, PC/rGO-40, and PC electrodes. Inset is the magnified
Nyquist plots.

To further understand
the electrochemical properties of PC/rGO
electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
was carried out. Figure 3d displays the Nyquist profiles of rGO, PC, and PC/rGO-n electrodes in 1 M NaCl solution. The plots show an inclined line
in the low-frequency region and a small semicircle in the high-frequency
range. The small diameter of the semicircle indicates a small charge
transfer resistance and a high electrical conductivity of the PC/rGO
electrode.60 In the low-frequency region,
the inclined part corresponds to the Warburg impedance. The inclined
line of the PC/rGO-20 electrode shows the largest slope, suggesting
the most efficient ion diffusion in its porous structure.61

To further investigate the desalination
performance, batch-mode
MCDI experiments were carried out in NaCl solution with an initial
concentration of 500 mg L–1. As shown in the scheme
of the custom-made MCDI cell (Figure S8), cation- and anion-exchange membranes are placed in front of cathode
and anode, respectively. Figure 4a shows the typical electrosorption–desorption
cycle of PC/rGO-20 with an initial NaCl concentration of 500 mg L–1 at a voltage varying from 1.0 to 1.6 V. When a cell
voltage is applied, salt ions start to immigrate to and adsorb on
the electrodes. The solution conductivity decreases slowly until an
equilibrium is reached after ∼50 min. Subsequently, a reverse
voltage is applied on the electrodes. The conductivity slowly goes
back to the initial value, indicating the regeneration of electrodes
and can be used for the subsequent cycle. Clearly, with the increase
in the cell potential, larger decrease in conductivity is observed
due to the adsorption of more ions. The transient current curve of
PC/rGO-20 in Figure 4b exhibits a similar trend to that of the conductivity. Charge efficiency
is used to evaluate the energy consumption of MCDI and analyze its
EDL model. Generally, higher voltages are beneficial to enhancing
the charge efficiency of MCDI system. Figure 4c shows the charge efficiencies of the PC/rGO-20
electrode in 500 mg L–1 NaCl solution at voltages
from 1.0 to 1.6 V. The electrosorption–desorption behaviors
of the other PC/rGO electrodes as well as PC and rGO electrodes were
examined (Figures S9 and S10). Their salt
removal capacities are calculated and summarized in Figure 4d. Consistent with the CV results,
PC/rGO-20 exhibits the highest electrosorption capacity. The results
indicate the synergistic effect between rGO sheets and the PC derived
from Fe–MOF. Moreover, the ratio between Fe–MOF and
GO played an important role in the enhanced performance of the composite
electrodes. The CDI Ragone plot, combing two important parameters
of salt adsorption capacity and salt adsorption rate, is an effective
measure to evaluate the capacitive deionization behavior of the electrodes.62 CDI Ragone plots of salt removal rate vs salt
removal capacity of PC/rGO-20 composite, PC, and rGO are shown in Figure S11. Clearly, PC/rGO-20 composite located
in the upper-right of the Ragone plot, delivers both a higher salt
removal rate and a higher salt removal capacity.

responses of PC/rGO-20 electrode at various cell voltages. (c) Charge

removal capacities of PC/rGO-10, PC/rGO-20, PC/rGO-30, and PC/rGO-40
composite electrodes at various cell potentials.

As shown in Figure 5a, the PC/rGO-20 electrode shows an excellent stability for
22 cycles
without an obvious decay of electrosorption capacity. Further electrosorption
experiments were carried out with different initial concentrations
from 125 to 1000 mg L–1. Figure 5b illustrates the electrosorption isotherms
of PC/rGO-20 electrode at cell potentials of 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6
V, respectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm method is adapted
to fit our data, which is presented as , where q is the amount
of adsorbed NaCl (mg g–1), qm is the maximum adsorption capacity corresponding to complete
monolayer adsorption, KL is the Langmuir
constant, and C is the equilibrium concentration
(mg L–1). As shown in Figure 5b, with the initial concentration increasing
from 125 to 1000 mg L–1, the salt removal capacity
of PC/rGO-20 increases accordingly. The PC/rGO-20 composites exhibit
a superior salt removal capacity of 37.6 mg g–1 in
a 1000 mg L–1 NaCl solution at 1.2 V, which is among
the best of the previously reported electrode materials for CDI or
MCDI (Table S1). The excellent performance
of the PC/rGO composite electrodes can be ascribed to the following
reasons: (1) the 3D porous structure constructed by conducting rGO
networks provides a highly conductive pathway. (2) The highly porous
carbon derived from Fe–MOF contributes to the enhanced electrosorption
capacity. (3) The combination of porous carbon and rGO networks with
optimum ratio can integrate the advantages of high surface area and
high electrical conductivity, leading to the excellent MCDI performance.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel
MCDI electrode consists of a highly interconnecting
3D graphene architecture with MOF-derived porous carbon rods, which
can not only provide conductive networks for electron transport but
also shorten the diffusion length of ions. Therefore, our PC/rGO composite
electrode exhibits excellent desalination performance, i.e., 37.6
mg g–1 in a 1000 mg L–1 NaCl solution
at 1.2 V. This strategy can also be extended to other MOF-derived
carbon electrodes.

Experimental Section
Method
Preparation
of Fe–MOF Crystals
FeCl3, 0.6488 g, was
dissolved in 10 mL deionized (DI) water to form a
yellow solution, which was mixed with another solution composing of
0.4643 g fumaric acid and 10 mL dimethylformamide (DMF). The formed
mixture was then transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave,
heated at 80 °C for 4 h, and naturally cooled down to room temperature.
The collected samples were subsequently washed with DMF and DI water
for several times and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h.

Preparation
of Fe–MOF/GO Composites
The Fe–MOF/GO
composite aerogel was prepared by the method reported in our previous
report. The Fe–MOF was added into the GO solution (4 mg mL–1) and vigorously mixed for 5 min using a QL-901
vortex mixer, forming a Fe–MOF/GO composite hydrogel. Fe–MOF/GO
composite aerogel was obtained by freeze-dry process. To adjust the
weight ratios of Fe–MOFs to GO (10:1, 20:1, 30:1, and 40:1),
Fe–MOF/GO-10, Fe–MOF/GO-20, Fe–MOF/GO-30, and
Fe–MOF/GO-40 were obtained.

Preparation of PC/rGO Composites
PC/rGO composites
were obtained by carbonization of Fe–MOF/GO-n at 800 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under N2 atmosphere. After annealing,
the samples were etched in 5 mol L–1 HCl aqueous
solution for 24 h. Finally, the products were washed using DI water
until pH close to 7 and then dried at 60 °C overnight.

Characterization
The morphologies of obtained samples
were recorded by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (HITACHI
SU-8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-100CX II).
The samples were characterized by X’Pert PRO (PANalytical)
with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 15.4 nm). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
was measured by ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics). Multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
is used to calculate the specific surface area from N2 adsorption
data. Raman spectroscopy was performed by Renishaw inVia confocal
Raman system with the laser wavelength of 532 nm. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) measurements were conducted in 1 mol L−1 NaCl
solution by using CHI 760E electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode
mode. The electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
were carried out in 1 mol L–1 NaCl solution by using
Autolab PGSTAT302N.

Fabrication of MCDI Electrodes
MCDI
electrodes were
prepared by mixing samples, conductive carbon black, and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. The mixture was stirred
uniformly with the addition of n-methyl pyrrolidone
(NMP) solution and coated on a graphite paper of 5 × 5 cm2. Finally, the electrodes were dried at 60 °C for 12
h in vacuum oven. The mass loading is around 50 mg.

Electrosorption
Measurement
To evaluate the desalination
performance of the samples, batch-mode experiments were carried out
by a continuously recycling system, which includes a MCDI cell, a
peristaltic pump (YZ-1515x, Longer Pump), a conductivity meter (DDSJ-308F,
Leici), and a source meter (SMU-2400, Keithley). The IEMs were purchased
from Zhejiang China (Hangzhou Grion Environmental Technology Co.,
Ltd). The type of cation exchange membrane is polyethylene heterogeneous
ion exchange membrane (LE-HeCM-1, Type 1), and the type of anion exchange
membrane is heterogeneous ion exchange membrane (LE-HeAM-I, Type 1).
The anion exchange membrane was placed in front of the positive electrode
and the cation exchange membrane in front of the negative electrode.
The total volume of the initial concentrations of NaCl solutions is
50 mL with concentrations varying from 125 to 1000 mg L–1, and the flow rate is 30 mL min–1. The electrosorption
tests at every concentration were performed at different cell voltages
ranging from 1.0 to 1.6 V with an interval of 0.2 V. The conductivity
is recorded every 20 s. The electrosorption capacity, Γ (mg
g–1), is calculated by eq 1 1  where Ci is the
initial NaCl concentration (mg L–1), Ct is the final NaCl concentration (mg L–1), V is the volume of NaCl solution (L), and M is the total mass of the electrodes (g).

The charge
efficiency, Λ (%), is defined by eq 2 2  where F is Faraday’s
constant (96485 C mol–1), Γ is the electrosorption
capacity (mol g–1), ∑ is calculated by the
integration of charging current curve (C g–1), and MNaCl is the molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g mol–1).
