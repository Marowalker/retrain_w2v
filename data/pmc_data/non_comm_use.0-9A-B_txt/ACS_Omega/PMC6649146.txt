Silicone resins are traditional thermoset
polymers with an inorganic
backbone, affording chemical inertness and high thermal stability,
which also makes them inherently difficult to recycle by traditional
methods. Here, we demonstrate that catalytic amounts of fluoride ion
at room temperature solubilize highly cross-linked silicone resins
initially cured up to 250 °C. After solubilization equilibria
are achieved, solvent is removed to reform the polymer network. Coatings
on aluminum substrates and monoliths of virgin and recycled silicone
resins were evaluated for hydrophobicity, wear resistance, substrate
adhesion, and thermal stability. Silicones recycled under optimized
conditions retained nearly 100% wear resistance, thermal stability,
and adhesion properties. In some instances, the recycled coatings
offer properties superior to the initial materials.

1 Introduction
Polysiloxanes
(polyorganosiloxanes) are commonly referred to as
silicones. Commercial silicones are used as fluids, elastomers, or
in resin forms with properties based on structural differences that
rely on various compositions of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetravalent
units with the respective symbols and general formulas: M = R3SiO1/2, D = R2SiO2/2 (siloxane),
T = R1SiO1/2 (silsesquioxane, SQ), and Q = SiO4/2.

Their low glass-transition temperatures, thermal
stabilities, chemical
inertness, and low coefficients of friction make silicones useful
in many applications in the automotive, aerospace, cookware, and medical
industries.1 D units can be linked to form
linear polysiloxane (silicones) as low to high molecular weight fluids.
The R groups are typically methyl [most commercially useful silicone:
poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS], phenyl, a mix of methyl and phenyl,
a mix of methyl and hydrogen, a mix of methyl and alkyl, or trifluoropropyl.

Linear polysiloxanes with cross-linkable functional groups in the
backbone or on the chain ends are cured to form silicone elastomers.
Increasing cross-link densities increases moduli and hardness from
soft gels to hard rubbers, which lead to very diverse applications.
High thermal stability, hot air resistance, oxidative resistance,
and flame retardancy make silicone elastomers ideal for tubing, gaskets,
fixtures, sealants, and coatings in automotive and aerospace applications.2−4

Because of their physiological inertness, silicone elastomers
are
used in food contact applications as well as medical applications,
such as prosthetics, implants, catheters, and heart valve seals.5,6 Silicone elastomers exhibit strong adhesion to metal and glass substrates
and provide a low surface energy, low friction, nonstick, hydrophobic
surface suitable for applications in casting, mold making, mold release,
water repellent coatings, antigraffiti coatings, cookware, and the
paper industry.7−9

Unlike silicone fluids and elastomers, silicone
resins also contain
T and Q units. These tri- and tetrafunctional units create highly
branched and cage-like networks with high cross-link densities, especially
compared to silicone elastomers. Combinations of units are typically
used to balance the properties. For example, pure T resins can be
brittle, but adding D or M units increases elasticity and adhesion.1 Silicone resins combine high temperature, oxidation,
and UV stabilities, as well as resistance to acids, oils, and water,
making them ideal for many coating applications, including release,
hydrophobic, oleophobic, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance,
anticorrosion, protective, decorative, insulating, antifouling, sealants,
and paints.1,7−9

Many of silicone’s
favorable properties are attributed to
their robust inorganic siloxane backbones and cross-links. However,
because thermosets do not melt like thermoplastics, it makes it much
more difficult to recycle and reuse them. Thermoset polymer recycling
is classified into three categories: mechanical, thermal, and chemical
recycling. Mechanical recycling involves grinding the thermoset to
a powder and using a low loading as filler in a chemically similar
polymer, which often results in a reduction of mechanical properties.10,11 Thermosets can be thermally recycled (burned) to generate energy
and recover fillers, but the process is energy-intensive because of
silicone’s high thermal stability and creates unwanted greenhouse
gases.

Chemical recycling of silicones has focused on depolymerizing
silicone
fluids and cross-linked silicone rubbers into monomers that subsequently
need to be repolymerized as a route to the only partial replacement
of virgin materials. Early research focused on aminolysis to cleave
Si–O bonds to create silylamines and alcohol.12,13 Cast films of silicone rubber recycled in n-butylamine
showed a 40% loss of tensile strength and 20% loss in percent elongation
at break. Okamoto et al. explored alcoholysis of PDMS oils and cross-linked
rubbers in a pressure reactor with the aid of metal halide catalysts
and dimethyl carbonate.14

The metal
halide polarizes the siloxane bond at the chain end as
methanol attacks the Si–O to form methoxysilane and a shorter
polysiloxane chain. Dimethyl carbonate reacts with the water co-product
to form methanol and carbon dioxide. Depolymerization times are long
because the reaction progresses only at the chain ends by cleaving
one monomer at a time. The use of pressure reactors in bulk recycling
is also an economical and scalability challenge.

Enthaler and
co-workers used iron and zinc catalysts to activate
Si–O bonds in PDMS and cleave them with benzoyl fluoride, benzyl
chloride, or acetic anhydride to make silicon-containing monomers.15−18 These depolymerization reactions typically require high temperature,
high pressure, long reaction times, and produce acid by-products with
low yields. The same researchers later used boron trifluoride etherate
(BF3OEt2) to depolymerize PDMS at lower temperatures.19,20 Large quantities of BF3OEt2 (0.75–2
equiv per polymer repeat unit) and complex isolation techniques were
required to generate 75–87% yields of monomers, which require
further reaction to become useful products.

Researchers have
also built-in recyclable cross-links to polysiloxanes
to promote decross-linking as opposed to depolymerization of siloxane
units. Gou et al. modified tetramethyltetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane
with furan by a thiol–ene reaction, forming thermally reversible
cross-links via Diels–Alder reactions with bismaleimide.21 Decross-linking took place at 120 °C via
the retro Diels–Alder reaction, forming a liquid that was reshaped
and cooled to a solid. The low decross-linking temperature may be
useful in some applications but limits the thermal stability usually
expected of silicones. Disulfide bonds with a dynamic covalent behavior
incorporated into a silicone provide photoreversible cross-links (e.g.,
sunlight).22 A mechanical property retention
of ≈80% was achieved by first pulverizing the cross-linked
silicone and then pressing and irradiating it for up to 48 h with
a xenon lamp or natural sunlight. Both studies employed polymers structurally
designed to be depolymerizable, limiting usefulness to niche applications
and which did not address recycling common to the widely used silicones.

Presently, chemical recycling efforts with silicones has mainly
focused on depolymerizing silicone fluids, linear silicones, and some
cross-linked silicone rubbers into monomers that subsequently need
to be repolymerized as a partial replacement for virgin materials.12−22 Studies on recycling silicone resins directly are lacking. Silicone
resins are more challenging to recycle than silicone rubbers because
of the presence of T and Q units, which significantly increase the
cross-link density compared to rubber elastomers. Reuse of the collected
monomers requires traditional multistep silicone polymerization and
curing techniques; thus, they require the same amount of energy, reagents,
and so forth, as in the production of virgin silicones.

This
type of downcycling usually reuses recovered materials in
lower demand or lower value products. A chemical recycling approach
for silicone fluids, rubbers, and resins that is low energy/cost with
≈100% yields and ≈100% retention of properties would
be very attractive for the widespread silicone industry. More valuable
yet would be to create a closed-loop recycling process, where the
recycled silicone can be reused for the same application.

In
the work reported here, traditionally difficult to recycle thermosetting
silicone resins with a mixed phenyl/methyl functionality were recycled
in one step by fluoride ion (F–)-catalyzed rearrangement
at ambient temperature and pressure and showed near 100% retention
of measured properties. Our research group has previously demonstrated
F–-catalyzed rearrangement of polymeric SQs (or
T resins), T8 SQ cages, or RSi(OEt)3 into T10 and T12 cages on removal of F–.23−28

These facile reactions occur at room temperature in THF with
trace
amounts of water and a F– source, such as tetrabutylammonium
fluoride (nBu4NF, TBAF), and form discrete SQ cages. Furgal
et al. have proposed possible mechanistic pathways for these F-mediated
rearrangement reactions on the basis of exhaustive experimental analyses
and modeling studies.28 Rearrangement of
T (and D and Q) silicon units involves complex and multiple intermediate
processes, leading to equilibria among many intermediate species.28 Reaction intermediates continue to reorganize
and eventually lead to discreet cages with mixed functionalities upon
fluoride removal. Recently, we reported that leaving F– in solution with D and T silicone units and removing the solvent
generates random polysiloxane networks, forming hydrophobic and wear-resistant
coatings with mixed functionalities on the basis of starting materials.29

In this work, we reintroduce F– to cured thermoset
silicone resins to solubilize them in one step under ambient conditions,
recast/recoat, and explore the influence of curing and recycling conditions
on the wear resistance, adhesion, and thermal/oxidative stability
of prime (virgin) and recycled resins. Thereafter, we discuss the
process–structure–property relationships supported by
morphological and compositional analyses.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Wear Resistance and Hydrophobicity
versus
Recycling Conditions
The silicone resin made from dodecaphenylsilsesquioxane
(Ph-T12) and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) has a 1 Me:1 Ph ratio and 2 T units:1 D unit. At this ratio of
T:D units, the cross-link density of the resin is very high as each
T unit creates a cross-link, especially compared to silicone rubber
elastomers, with far fewer cross-linkable functionalities. Consistent
solution concentrations (10 wt % silicone) in TBAF/THF ensured a uniform
thickness of spray coatings on Al 2024 coupons. Monoliths of resin
were cast and cured to produce enough material for recycling reactions
(Figure 1d). The cured
resin was insoluble in THF without an F– source.
Dissolution time decreased with increasing [F–]
and increased with increasing cure temperature. Wear resistance was
evaluated by a linear abrasion test, where the change in water contact
angle (WCA) is measured after 50 wear cycle increments (back and forth
= one cycle) with a 100 g weighted 2000 grit sandpaper. All prime
coatings had consistent initial average WCAs between 90 and 92°
with little deviation (Figure 1a), but after 50–200 wear cycles, coatings cured at
150° and 200 °C had higher and more variable WCAs. The WCA
increase, attributed to surface roughening from the sandpaper, indicates
the coatings were not as hard and abrasion-resistant as the coatings
cured at 250 °C, which exhibit steady and consistent WCA after
200 wear cycles. Higher cure temperatures possibly decrease plasticizing
volatiles and increase cross-link densities as will be evidenced below.

Figure 1 WCA vs the number of wear cycles for (a) prime, (b) recycled
(0.01
M TBAF/THF) silicone resin coatings cured at varied temperatures,
and (c) varied [F–] to recycle silicone resins cured
at 250 °C. (d) Silicone recycling loop.

Coatings made from silicone resins recycled in 0.01 M TBAF
and
then cured at 150 and 200 °C had higher increases in WCA upon
wear testing (Figure 1b) compared to prime coatings, which suggests that the recycled resin
is softer. The recycled resin coating cured at 150 °C had a WCA
of 103 ± 3° after 100 wear cycles and then declined to 96
± 7° after 200 wear cycles. The WCA of the recycled resin
coating cured at 200 °C peaked at 117 ± 4° after 150
wear cycles before declining, which indicates the 50 °C increase
in cure temperature produces a soft (roughenable) coating, but with
a better cohesive strength.

Recycled resin cured at 250 °C
offered consistent WCAs from
0 to 200 wear cycles and was similar to the 250 °C cured prime
coatings. The 250 °C cure temperature is necessary to produce
a harder silicone that does not easily roughen as exhibited by the
consistent WCA after wear. SEM-EDS images of both prime (Figure 2a,b) and 0.01 M TBAF
recycled (Figure 2i,j)
resin coatings after 200 wear cycles show an intact and complete coating
layer with no exposure of Al coupon substrate. Coating adhesion, measured
by a cross-hatch score and tape peel adhesion test (ASTM D3359), for
both prime (Figure 2c,d) and 0.01 M TBAF recycled (Figure 2k,l) resin coatings had the highest rating (5B), indicating
excellent adhesion to the Al substrate. When cured at 250 °C,
this model silicone resin forms a hard, adherent, wear-resistant,
and hydrophobic coating that can be easily recycled and reapplied
with retention of mechanical properties.

Figure 1c shows
the influence of [F–] in the recycling solution
on the wear resistance and adhesion properties of the silicone resin
coating cured at 250 °C. Initial WCA on a coating of resin recycled
in 0.01 M TBAF was similar to that of the prime coating. The coating
of resin recycled with the highest [F–] solution,
0.1 M TBAF, was hydrophilic with an initial WCA of <90°. The
coating was nonuniform (Figure S1a,b) with
patches of Al substrate exposed and exhibited a significant loss of
coating after 200 wear cycles (Figure 2m,n). The high [F–] could have resulted
in the formation of many Si–F bonds in the polymer that readily
convert to hydrophilic Si–OH in the presence of adventitious
water and continually replenish as wear creates new surfaces. Formation
of Si–F bonds would also prevent formation of Si–O3/2 or SQ linkages, thus reducing the cross-link density and
wear resistance. F was not detected by EDS in any of the thin films
or in monoliths of resin recycled with 0.002 or 0.01 M TBAF, but F
was present in the monolith cast from resin recycled with 0.1 M TBAF
solution (Figure S2). Thus, fluorine remains
in the recycled resin, but under optimal recycling conditions, 0.01
M TBAF, the amount is too low to be detected by EDS.

Dissolution
of resin cured at 250 °C was attempted in 0.001
M TBAF, but after stirring for 7 days, the solution remained cloudy
with solids. After increasing the [F–] to 0.002
M TBAF, the solution became clear within 24 h, thus identifying the
minimum threshold of F– necessary to disassociate
the silicone network into soluble oligomers. The spray coatings from
this minimum [F–] recycling solution are also nonuniform
(Figure S1c,d), hydrophilic both initially
and after 200 wear cycles (Figure 1c), and soft enough to roughen after 50 wear cycles
as suggested by the WCA increase from 87 ± 2° to 106 ±
3°. An F– deficient system may lead to an insufficient
number of reactive Si atoms necessary to reform the highly cross-linked
network upon solvent removal, resulting in poor wear resistance (Figure 2e,f).

2.2 Thermal Stability
The thermal stability
of the silicone resin, identified as the average temperature at 5%
mass loss (Td5%) via TGA in air, increased
with cure temperature (Figure 3a) to a maximum of 483 ± 7 °C when
cured at 250 °C. Td5% of the resin
cured at 200 °C was slightly lower, 470 ± 6 °C, but
both resins exhibit two main mass losses between 400–575°
and 575–700 °C, attributed to the methyl/phenyl groups
and char, respectively. Resin cured at the lowest temperature of 150
°C had a 130 °C lower Td5% (353
± 5 °C) because of a third mass loss below 400 °C attributed
to volatiles, which were elucidated by GC–MS.

(a) prime and recycled (0.01 M TBAF) silicone
resins cured at different temperatures and (b) 250 °C cured prime
and recycled silicone resins at different TBAF concentrations. Inset
tables: comparison of thermal stabilities defined as temperature at
5% mass loss, Td5%. The error corresponds
to the standard deviation of three experiments for each resin iteration.

A sample of silicone resin cured
at 150 °C was heated to 200
°C in a closed thermal desorption system to evolve only the volatiles
that would come off from increasing the cure temperature from 150°
to 200 °C (Figure 4a), which were then injected into the GC–MS. The most abundant
compound detected was tributylamine (413 ppm, 46% of total volatiles),
which has a boiling point of 214 °C and is the main decomposition
product of TBAF. The second most abundant compound was butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT, 123 ppm, 14% of total volatiles), which has a boiling point
of 265 °C and was the inhibitor in the THF. These and other TBAF
and BHT decomposition products accounted for >90% of the total
volatiles
detected. These by-products can act as plasticizing impurities that
lower network integrity, cross-link density, thermal stability, wear
resistance, and adhesion. Cyclic siloxane oligomers D3,
D4, and D5, which are common silicone degradation
products, were detected in small quantities totaling 2.5% of volatiles.

Figure 4 GC–MS
of prime silicone resin (a) cured at 150 °C and
tested at 150–200 °C and (b) cured at 200 °C and
tested at 200– 250 °C to determine the volatile content
at different cure temperatures.

Silicone resin cured at 200 °C was heated to 250 °C
under
similar conditions to evolve only the volatiles that would come off
from increasing the cure temperature from 200° to 250 °C
(Figure 4b), which
were then analyzed by GC–MS. The total amount of tributylamine,
BHT, and TBAF/BHT decomposition products decreased to 116 ppm, 86%
less than the resin cured at 150 °C. Cyclic siloxane oligomer
degradation products accounted for 10% of total volatiles. The primary
compound detected was benzene (243 ppm), which accounted for 60% of
all volatiles. Benzene was only detected from the resin on heating
to 250 °C. A widely accepted free radical sequence first proposed
by Sobolevski accounts for benzene evolution from mixed methyl/phenyl
polysiloxanes.31−33 Si–C scission generates a phenyl radical (C6H5) that abstracts a hydrogen from a methyl group
to form benzene (boiling point = 80 °C). This also forms a methylene
group that attacks another Si atom, creating a cross-link and displacing
another phenyl radical. The process generates benzene while increasing
the cross-link density. Continuation of the process creates degradation
products of small sections of the silicone network like bis(di(trimethylsiloxy)phenylsiloxy)trimethylsiloxyphenylsiloxane
(Figure 4b).

The Td5% increase from raising the
cure temperature from 200° to 250 °C can be explained by
the GC–MS findings of decreased total volatile species, increased
cross-link density, and reduced organic content from benzene generation.
Resins recycled with 0.01 M TBAF had nearly the same Td5% as the prime resin at a given cure temperature (Figure 3b), indicating no
significant loss of thermal stability. GC–MS showed similar
levels of volatiles in both the prime and 0.01 M TBAF recycled resins
cured at 250 °C (Figure S3). However, the Td5% of silicone resin recycled with 0.1 M TBAF decreased 51°C
to 432 ± 6 °C because of a mass loss event below 400 °C.
This is attributed to the order of magnitude increase in TBAF concentration,
which resulted in a five times increase in TBAF degradation products
(Figure S4).

2.3 Recycling
Commercial Silicone Resin
Optimized recycling conditions
(0.01 M TBAF/THF at RT) were used
to evaluate our technique on a commercial mixed phenyl/methyl silicone
resin. SILRES REN 50 (Wacker Chemie) cured at 250 °C was stirred
at RT in 0.01 M TBAF/THF until completely dissolved, which took 55
min. The cured resin is insoluble in THF alone as well as toluene
and xylene. Solutions (10 wt %) of prime and recycled SILRES spray-coated
on clean Al coupons and cured at 250 °C were tested for hydrophobicity,
wear resistance, adhesion, and thermal stability. Initial WCAs for
both coatings were 90°. After 50–200 wear cycles, the
prime coating was roughened and then significantly worn away as indicated
by the abrupt increase in WCA to 116 ± 4° after 50 cycles
followed a decline (Figure 5a) and the large amount of substrate was exposed after 200
wear cycles (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 SILRES REN 50 coatings cured at 250 °C: (a) WCA vs wear; (b)
typical TGA in air; (c–e) SEM images of prime coating after
0 wear cycles, 200 wear cycles, and tape adhesion test; (f–h)
SEM images of recycled coating after 0 wear cycles, 200 wear cycles,
and tape adhesion test; EDS map (magnification 27×, scale bar
1000 μm) of prime coating (i) before and (j) after rubbing half
with 0.01 M TBAF solution. Wear micrograph magnification 100×,
scale bar 300 μm. Cross-hatch magnification 35×, scale
bar 800 μm, EDS map: yellow = Si, blue = Al. The error bars
denote standard deviations obtained from three wear tests per coating.

The recycled SILRES coating showed
little WCA change and less wear
(Figure 5g) after 200
cycles. Coating adhesion of the recycled coating was equal to or better
than the prime coating (Figure 5e,h). The thermal stability of the SILRES was 73 °C higher
after recycling (Figure 5b). Mechanical and thermal property increases after recycling are
attributed to the formation of a more cross-linked network as evidenced
by the GC–MS spectra (Figure S5),
showing less silicone network degradation products and the evolution
of benzene due to cross-linking upon heating. Lastly, a cotton swab
soaked in 0.01M TBAF was used to selectively remove a portion of cured
SILRES (Figure 5i,j)
to demonstrate the modification, patterning, and repair capabilities
of our technique. Our technique also works for silicone rubbers, which
is unsurprising because rubbers have lower cross-link densities than
resins. A common room-temperature curing silicone rubber, ELASTOSIL
E10 (Wacker Chemie), dissolved in less than 15 min when stirred in
0.01 M TBAF/THF.

3 Conclusions
Wear
resistance, adhesion, and thermal stability of the methyl/phenyl
silicone resin were maximized with curing at 250 °C. The cured
resin was insoluble in THF and common silicone solvents (toluene,
xylene), but in the presence of F–, all D and T
units equilibrate to solubilize the resin in THF at room temperature.
This solubility equilibrium provides the opportunity to add new silicone
structural units and functionalities to the system if desired. The
polymeric network then reforms on solvent removal.

Under optimized
recycling conditions (0.01 M TBAF), second-generation
coatings and monoliths retain mechanical and thermal properties. Room-temperature
chemical recycling techniques for thermosets are rare and nonexistent
for silicone resins with only catalytic amounts of reagent to the
best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the process can be considered
closed-loop because of the nearly 100% retention of wear and thermal
properties, making it more sustainable than mechanical/thermal recycling
or landfilling. Most importantly, we have shown our method not only
works for a widespread commercial silicone resin, but preliminary
data suggest the possibility of upcycling because of improved wear
and thermal resistance after recycling.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Silicone Resin Coatings
Dodecaphenylsilsesquioxane (Ph-T12, 25.0 g, 16.13 mmol,
made in-house), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4, 7.18
g, 24.20 mmol, from Gelest, Inc.), and THF (321 mL, from VWR, used
without purification) were added into a dry round bottom flask equipped
with magnetic stirring. TBAF (5.0 mL, 1 M in THF, from Sigma-Aldrich)
was added via syringe and stirred at RT for 4 days. The coating concentration
was 10 wt %, the ratio of functional groups was 1 Ph:1 Me, and the
ratio of T to D units was 2:1. All chemicals were used as received.
All reactions were conducted at room temperature in the presence of
air. Aluminum 2024 coupons (0.81 × 76.2 × 152.4 mm) cleaned
with alumina slurry, rinsed with distilled water, rinsed with acetone,
and dried with an air flow were spray-coated with a DeVilbiss gravity
HVLP spray gun and cured at 150°, 200°, or 250 °C for
18 h.

4.2 Silicone Resin Recycling
Monoliths
of the resin were cast from 10 wt % solutions in open aluminum dishes.
The solvent was allowed to evaporate in a fume hood overnight followed
by heating to 50 °C for 4 h, 100 °C for 4 h, and the final
temperature (150°, 200°, or 250 °C) for 18 h. Cured
resin pieces (2.0 g) were added into a dry round bottom flask equipped
with magnetic stirring. TBAF/THF (18.0 g) solution at molar concentrations
of 0.1, 0.01, or 0.002 M was added into the flask and stirred until
all solids dissolved. Dissolution time in 0.01 M TBAF/THF increased
with cure temperature from 150° (≈10 h), to 200°
(≈18 h), to 250 °C (≈24 h). The dissolution time
of 250 °C cured resin in 0.1 M TBAF/THF was ≈6 h. Resin
recycling in a 0.001 M TBAF/THF solution was attempted, but after
7 days, the solution remained cloudy. The TBAF concentration was increased
to 0.002 M, and the solution became clear in ≈24 h. Recycled
resins were spray-coated as described above and cured to the same
temperature, at which the prime cast monoliths were cured (150°,
200°, or 250 °C) for 18 h.

4.3 WCA Measurement
Droplets (10 μL)
of distilled water pipetted onto a coated surface were photographed
edge-on and measured with the aid of PowerPoint. WCA measurements
were repeated on three different areas of each coating and reported
as an average with standard deviation error bars.

4.4 Wear Resistance
A 25 × 75 mm
strip of the coating was abraded by rubbing a 100 g weighted (2 kPa)
piece of 2000 grit silicon carbide sandpaper back and forth at a rate
of approximately 50 mm/s. A combined back and forth motion was considered
one wear cycle, and WCAs were measured after 50, 100, 150, and 200
cycles. Wear tests were repeated on three different areas of each
coating, and the average WCA was reported with error bars, indicating
the standard deviation. Milionis et al. recently reported in a review
that a linear abrasion test method had the most potential as a universal
standard for testing the durability of superhydrophobic coatings.30

4.5 Tape Adhesion Test
Coating adhesion
was evaluated according to ASTM D3359.

4.6 SEM-EDS
SEM was performed with a
Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope in variable pressure
mode (15 Pa) with a backscatter electron detector set in composition
mode and with an accelerating voltage of 5 and 10 kV for EDS with
a Bruker Nano X-Flash detector (410-M).

4.7 TGA
Thermal stability was evaluated
via a Q600 SDT simultaneous DSC/TGA instrument (TA Instruments Inc.,
New Castle, DE). Monoliths were prepared according to the same procedure
described above for recycling. Samples (≈5 mg) were cut from
the monoliths, loaded into alumina pans, and ramped at 10 °C/min
to 1000 °C in an air flow of 100 mL/min.

4.8 GC–MS
All GC–MS analyses
were done using a Thermo Scientific TRACE 1310 system equipped with
a Thermo Scientific TG-5MS column (60 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25
μm film thickness, 5% diphenyl-/95% dimethylpolysiloxane stationary
phase) and an ISQ LT single quadrupole mass spectrometer (electron
impact ionization). Thermal desorption was performed using a CDS Analytical
Pyroprobe 5000 with a Tenax TA trap by heating ≈15 mg samples
at 10 °C/min to 50 °C above cure temperature and holding
for 15 min.
