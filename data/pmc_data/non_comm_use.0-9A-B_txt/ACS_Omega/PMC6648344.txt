Lead zirconate titanate (PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, PZT) alloys have been extensively
studied to be used for
piezoelectric nanogenerators to harvest energy from mechanical motions.
In this study, PZT nanofiber-based nanogenerators were fabricated
to test their true piezoelectric performance without the triboelectric
effect. Aligned PZT nanofibers were fabricated by a sol–gel
electrospinning process. The thickness, area, and orientation of the
PZT textile made by electrospinning a PZT solution onto multipair
metal wires or metal mesh were controlled to form a composite textile.
After the calcination, the PZT textile mixed with polydimethylsiloxane
was placed between two flexible indium-doped tin oxide–polyethylene
naphthalate substrates. The performance parameters of the nanogenerators
were investigated under the bending motion, which excludes the triboelectric
effect. An assembled nanogenerator of an area of 8 cm2 and
a thickness of 80 μm could generate an electrical output voltage
of 1.1 V and a current of 1.4 μA under the bending strain. The
piezoelectric voltage depended on the thickness of the PZT textile,
whereas the piezoelectric current depended on both the thickness and
the area of the PZT textile. The electrical performance of the device
was significantly affected by the orientation of the PZT fiber and
the bending direction. The output voltage and the output current were
strain-dependent, whereas the total integrated charge was independent
of the strain rate. The properties of the flexible nanogenerator could
be quantified to verify the pure piezoelectric performance of the
device.

Introduction
Energy harvesting technologies
have encountered several challenges
over the past decades because of the exhaustion of certain fossil
fuel sources and an increasing awareness of the environmental effects
of current fuel consumption strategies. Devices that harvest energy
from ambient sources, such as solar, wind, mechanical vibrations,
or thermal energy, have been developed recently as alternatives to
fossil fuels. Among these, nanogenerators offer promise as a renewable
source of energy that converts vibrational or mechanical energy directly
into electrical energy. Piezoelectric nanogenerators are useful in
portable devices because they are flexible and lightweight, and their
energy sources are easily accessible. High-performance piezoelectric
nanogenerators can be manufactured using various piezoelectric materials,
including ZnO,1−7 PbZr0.52Ti0.48 (PZT),8−12 BaTiO3,13−16 KNbO3,17 NaNbO3,18 GaN,19 CdSe,20 ZnSnO3,21−23 and poly(vinylidene fluoride).24−27 Most of these inorganic materials
alone are not readily compatible with flexible devices because of
their brittleness. Therefore, flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators
have been prepared by dispersing piezoelectric nanoparticles in a
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix.12,17,18,28 Various nanoparticle-based
piezoelectric materials, such as NaNbO3 nanocubes and nanowires,18 KNLN (0.942(K0.48Na0.535)NbO3-0.058LiNbO3),17,28 or PZT nanoparticles,12 have been tested
in flexible nanogenerators.

Although piezoelectric nanoparticle
materials are more flexible
than bulk or thin film-based piezoelectric materials, the nanoparticles
tend to be poorly dispersed in the matrix and do not readily form
percolating networks in the PDMS matrix. Power generation measurements
collected from the nanoparticle-based nanogenerators have shown that
these devices are dependent on the strain mode.7 Electricity tends to be generated only at high compressive
forces.21 However, the compressive forces
can induce unavoidable electrostatic noise associated with the triboelectric
effect because of interfacial contact between the nanogenerator and
the measurement equipment. In addition, the PDMS matrix and the polymeric
substrate, typically polyethylene terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate
(PEN), can be readily charged and induce electrostatic noise (triboelectric
effect) that obscures a quantitative analysis of the piezoelectric
output.29,30

Composite nanofibers comprising PDMS
may be useful as flexible
piezoelectric nanogenerator materials. Chen et al. fabricated laterally
aligned PZT nanofibers on interdigitated electrodes of a Pt wire array
using the electrospinning method, and the nanogenerator produced a
voltage of 1.6 V under applied pressure.10 Wu et al. made a wearable nanogenerator with an electrospun PZT
textile in which the nanofibers were aligned parallel to one another.9 Following this report, Gu et al. achieved an
output voltage of 209 V from the vertically oriented PZT nanofiber
array.31 Previous studies have reported
that nanofibers may be used as highly efficient flexible nanogenerators.32

Here, we have produced flexible nanogenerators
based on electrospun
PZT nanofibers in a PDMS matrix. We have characterized the effects
of the device thickness, PZT textile stacking arrangement, device
area, and fiber orientation on the generation of piezoelectric power.
The flexible devices were loaded onto a measuring unit and deformed
by bending to minimize the triboelectric effect due to mechanical
friction. The relationship between the piezoelectric output and the
applied strain was obtained using PZT textiles having different orientations.
Finally, we measured the piezoelectric outputs generated at different
strain rates.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a schematic diagram of the process used to fabricate the well-aligned
PZT textiles. The well-aligned electrospun PZT textiles were prepared
on multipair parallel electrodes. The PZT nanowires aligned with parallel
wire collectors because of the repulsive forces between the negatively
charged fibers. The average diameter of a PZT fiber was about 270
nm for the as-spun fibers and 220 nm after calcination. The small
fiber diameter resulted from the degradation of the polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) polymer during the high-temperature calcination process. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the well-aligned PZT textiles
after the calcination process are shown in Figure 1b. The individual PZT nanofibers were uniformly
orientated and formed highly porous structures. The porous structures
of the PZT textiles facilitated the infiltration of the viscous PDMS
elastomer to form the flexible matrix of the piezoelectric nanogenerator
device.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram showing the process of fabricating the aligned
PZT textiles by electrospinning onto multipair metal wire collectors.
(b) SEM images of the PZT textile prepared with a parallel orientation
and (c) the randomly oriented PZT textile.

The degree of orientation alignment was determined by calculating
the fiber orientation factor S 1  where θ
is the angle formed between
the individual electrospun fibers and the multipair metal wires.33 The S value of the electrospun
PZT textile, which could range from 0 for anisotropic orientation
to 1 for perfect alignment, was 0.896. We fabricated a randomly oriented
PZT textile using a metal mesh collector to characterize the effects
of the fiber orientation on piezoelectricity production, as shown
in Figure 1c. The S value of the randomly oriented PZT textile was 0.219.
The large difference between the orientations in the two textiles
could affect the piezoelectric properties of the assembled devices.
The effects of the orientation on piezoelectricity generation are
discussed below.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles collected
from the calcined
PZT nanofibers are shown in Figure 2a. All the peaks in Figure 2a corresponded to a fully crystallized pure
perovskite PZT phase, and no impurity components were observed in
the samples after calcination at 650 °C for 3 h. Figure 2b,c shows high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images taken with a single electrospun
PZT nanofiber. The corresponding pattern of selective area electron
diffraction (SAED) is also provided. The HR-TEM images show that the
calcined PZT nanofibers were highly polycrystalline and had a lattice
separation of 2.9 Å in the (101) lattice plane.

calcined PZT textile. (b) TEM image of a single
PZT nanofiber. (c) HR-TEM image of a PZT nanofiber. The inset image
shows a SAED pattern of a PZT nanofiber.

A schematic diagram of an assembled flexible nanogenerator
based
on the well-aligned PZT textile embedded in a PDMS composite structure
is shown in Figure 3a. The PZT/PDMS composite layer was sandwiched between two flexible
indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)–PEN films and featured a strain-neutral
line along the middle of the PZT/PDMS composite layer. Thus, the upper
and lower parts of the PZT/PDMS layer were subject to tensile strain
and compressive strain in the PZT/PDMS depending on the distance from
the strain-neutral line. The performances of the two devices were
characterized quantitatively assuming that the strain applied to the
top layer of the PZT/PDMS layer was evenly distributed throughout
the composite layer. The applied strain was calculated according to eq 2 2  where r is the distance from
the strain-neutral line to the top of the composite layer, R is the radius of the strain-neutral arc, t is the thickness of the PZT/PDMS composite layer, h is the height of the arc, and a is the half-width
of the arc. The elastic modulus of PDMS was much smaller than that
of the PZT material; hence, the real applied strain on the PZT nanofiber
was smaller than the actual strain applied on the PZT/PDMS composite
layer.

(b) Photographic images of the devices assembled on a measurement
station without deformations or (c) with deformations.

Figure 3b,c shows
photographic images of the assembled flexible nanogenerator in the
initial state and in the bending state, respectively. The linear motor
moved back and forth to periodically perform bending and unbending
motions. During the bending motion, the flexible nanogenerator load
was transferred to the PZT nanofibers in the textile through the flexible
PDMS matrix. This strain produced a piezoelectric potential, and the
generated charges accumulated at the two electrodes. As the applied
strain was released, the accumulated electrons moved back in the opposite
direction, and the built-up piezoelectric potential disappeared, which
means that no additional charge was generated by the triboelectric
effect. Therefore, the flexible PZT nanogenerator generates a purely
alternating piezoelectric voltage and current under the periodic loading
of the bending and releasing movements.

It is important to distinguish
the true piezoelectric voltage from
the triboelectric voltage (electrostatic voltage). Before characterizing
the nanogenerator, we fabricated a PDMS-only sample without the PZT
textile and measured the electric signal induced by the bending motions.
As shown in Figure S1a,b, the electric
signals were insignificant. This means that the output power generated
by the PDMS/PZT composite generator was only because of electrons
induced by the piezoelectricity under the mechanical strain. We examined
the poling effects of the PZT on the piezoelectric output (see Figure S2a,b). The electric poling process improves
the alignment of electric dipoles along a direction of the applied
electric field, thereby increasing the piezoelectric output. The measured
output voltage and current increased with the poling field and reached
saturation at an electric field strength of 7.5 kV mm–1. A polarity switching test was performed to verify that the electric
signal originated from the pure piezoelectric effects (see Figure S3a,b). Exactly inverted polarities were
measured in a device with reverse connections, revealing that the
electric signals of the nanogenerator measured during the bending
motion resulted only from the piezoelectric effects of the PZT textile
in the PZT/PDMS composite layer.

The piezoelectric power generation
and related parameters were
investigated by measuring the output voltage and current in the assembled
PZT flexible nanogenerator as a function of PZT thickness varied from
20 to 40 μm. Figure 4a,b shows the measured output voltage and the measured current,
respectively. The strain induced by the bending motion was 0.18%,
and the area of the PZT was 4 cm2 (2 cm × 2 cm). The
measured values are listed in Table 1. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the piezoelectric voltage and current increased
with increasing PZT thickness. Because the individual PZT fibers functioned
as a piezoelectric source, both the piezoelectric voltage and the
current increased linearly with the amount of PZT present, indicated
by the thickness. The output voltage and the output current of the
device were increased in flexible nanogenerators constructed by stacking
two identical layers. The resulting device performances are plotted
in Figure 4c,d. The
measured values are listed in Table 1. The output voltage and the current obtained from
a two-layer stacker were twice the values obtained from a single-layered
stack, as shown in Figure 4c,d. These results demonstrate that both the piezoelectric
voltage and the current depend on the PZT thickness. Again, it means
that they originated from the piezoelectric effect without any triboelectric
effect. The stacking of PZT layers provides an effective approach
to obtaining high-performance piezoelectric nanogenerators.

nanogenerator, as a function of the PZT layer thickness. The area

The area of the PZT was 4 cm2. (e) Output voltage and (f)

We also examined the
effects of the PZT area on the performances
of the assembled devices. The device thickness was fixed during these
measurements, and only the areas of the two-layered PZTs (each layer
was 40 μm thick) were varied. The effects of geometry were minimized
by fixing the sample length at 2 cm while varying the PZT width. The
output voltage and the current are shown in Figure 4e,f, respectively. It should be noted that
the output voltages of the three devices were independent of the PZT
area, although the output current increased linearly with the area.
The output current densities of all devices were 0.2 μA cm–2. Therefore, it is quite evident that the piezoelectric
voltage depends on the PZT thickness, whereas the piezoelectric current
was affected by both the thickness and area of the PZT layer.

The effects of the fiber orientations in the PZT/PDMS composite
layer and the bending direction on the piezoelectric performance were
tested next. Figure 5a shows a schematic diagram of the various devices assembled using
the oriented PZT textiles. The device nomenclature indicates the fiber
orientation and bending motion. The randomly oriented PZT textile
was collected by electrospinning onto a mesh-type collector. SEM images
of the randomly oriented PZT nanofibers are shown in Figure 1c. The PZT fiber orientation
on the mesh-type collector was not perfectly isotropic because the
grids in the mesh-type collector were aligned in parallel. The S value of the nanofibers was 0.219. The physical properties,
such as the average fiber diameter, length, and density, remained
constant, and only the orientations of the PZT fibers were varied
in this set of devices.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic diagram showing a flexible PZT
nanogenerator embedded
in different PZT textiles. (b) Output voltage and (c) current measured
from three different nanogenerators under identical measurement conditions.

Although the strain applied to
the flexible nanogenerators was
fixed (0.18%), significant differences in the piezoelectric voltages
and current signals were obtained, as shown in Figure 5b,c. The piezoelectric voltage and the current
of the perpendicular device were 0.22 V and 0.16 μA, respectively.
The values were 24 and 23.5%, respectively, of the voltage and current
values measured in the parallel devices. The large difference between
the piezoelectric signals suggests that the actual strains on the
PZT nanofibers in the composite layers differ and depend on the fiber
orientation. The bending direction and fiber orientation were parallel
in the parallel device. A large portion of the PZT nanofibers deformed
longitudinally as the device was bent. On the other hand, the bending
direction and fiber orientation in the perpendicular device were orthogonal.
Therefore, few PZT nanofibers were stretched along the longitudinal
direction. For this reason, the perpendicular device showed a much
lower degree of piezoelectricity generation than the parallel device.
The voltage and current generated in the random device were, respectively,
49 and 48% of the values measured in the parallel device. Although
the fiber orientation factor (S) in the random device
was much lower than the value measured in the perpendicular device,
the electric output of the random device exceeded that obtained from
the perpendicular device. The fiber orientations in the random device
were isotropic. Therefore, the number of deformed PZT fibers in the
random device oriented along the bending direction exceeded the value
of the perpendicular device. The random device therefore provided
a higher piezoelectric output than the perpendicular device.

Next, the voltage and current generated from the nanogenerator
were investigated as a function of the applied strain for different
bending directions. The area of the PZT was 2 cm × 2 cm and the
thickness of the PZT/PDMS composite layer was fixed to 80 μm
(40 + 40 μm). The strain range was limited to 0.2% to prevent
buckling in the flexible device. As shown in Figure 6a,b, the voltage and the output current in
the devices were proportional to the applied strain. The output voltage
and current followed the trends plotted in Figure 5b,c over the measured strain range, but the
slopes of the output voltage and the current were different. Interestingly,
the output voltage and the output current in the parallel device slowly
increased as the strain increased from 0.02 to 0.13%, whereas the
output voltage and the current increased rapidly as the strain increased
from 0.13 to 0.18%. The different slope of the output voltage and
current measured by the parallel device could be divided into two
strain regions. At strains below 0.13%, the strain was insufficient
to provide a significant piezoelectric signal, and only small lattice
distortions were obtained in the PZT nanofibers. The PDMS in the composite
layer endured the majority of the applied strain because of its flexibility
at lower strains. Thus, the orientations in the PZT nanofibers were
not critical to the piezoelectric output. The three different devices
showed similar piezoelectric performance, as shown in Figure 5a,b. Strains beyond 0.13% led
to a rapid increase in the output voltages and currents in the parallel
device that exceeded the values measured in the other devices. A maximum
voltage of 1.1 V and a current of 0.85 μA were obtained. The
high output voltage and the current indicate that an applied strain
of more than 0.13% resulted in a large deformation of the PZT nanofibers
in the PZT/PDMS composite layer. The large increase in the piezoelectric
signal was attributed to the heterogeneous polarization at the interface
between the PZT nanofibers and the PDMS matrix. As the composite layer
bent under the applied strain, the crystallized PZT grains in the
composite layer narrowed under compressive strain to create large
Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization effects at the interface
between the PZT nanofibers and the PDMS matrix.21,28,33 The trends in piezoelectric output voltage
and current through applied strain were in good agreement with previously
reported trends .7,21 Although the trends in piezoelectric
signals measured from the random device were similar to those of the
parallel device, the slope of the piezoelectric signal was lower than
that of the corresponding signal measured in the parallel devices
because of poor orientation of the PZT fiber, as explained before.
For the perpendicular device, the piezoelectric output was small and
increased linearly within the measured strain range. The PZT nanofibers
were oriented normally to the bending axis so that the bending motions
did not induce much strain on the PZT nanofibers. These small deformations
were insufficient to produce stress-induced poling effects. The perpendicular
devices, therefore, did not show abrupt increase in the output signal
at strains above 0.13%.

Figure 6 Strain dependence of (a) the output voltage
and (b) the output
current as a function of strain for three different nanogenerators.

The piezoelectric performance
as a function of the strain rate
was examined next. Strain rates in the range of 0.04–1.36 s–1 were applied by changing the speed of the bending
machine. The total applied strain was fixed at 0.18%. The piezoelectric
voltage and the current were proportional to the applied strain rate,
as shown in Figure 7a,b. As the applied strain rate increased, the charges in the external
circuit were transported faster to neutralize the piezoelectric voltage.
This fast charge transport resulted in a large piezoelectric current.
Because the output voltage is the product of the output current and
external resistance, the voltage is proportional to the applied strain
rate. These results are consistent with the fundamental equation describing
piezoelectricity, as expressed by eq 3 3  where i is the output current, q is the generated charge, d33 is the
piezoelectric charge constant, E is Young’s
modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, ε is
the applied strain, and t is the time.35Figure 7c,d shows the output current and integrated charge of the
nanogenerator as a function of strain rate under the applied strain.
As mentioned above, the current signal at a high strain rate exhibited
sharper and narrower peaks compared to the one at a low strain rate.
The maximum output currents of 0.86 and 0.29 μA were measured
at strain rates of 1.36 and 0.11 s–1, respectively. Equation 3 indicates that the
integral of the measured output current represents the external free
charges transported from the external circuit to the nanogenerator
(Figure 7d). It should
be noted that the total charges generated under different strain rates
remained constant. The negligible discrepancies between the total
charges measured under a given applied strain could be attributed
to the lack of the piezoelectric charge loss through the nanogenerator
during the bending process.

and (b) the current

charge of a flexible nanogenerator subject to two different strain
rates under the same applied strain. Here, the device was assembled
using a two-layer PZT nanogenerator (80 μm and 4 cm2), and measurements were collected under an applied strain of 0.18%.

Conclusions
We fabricated flexible
piezoelectric nanogenerators using highly
oriented PZT nanofibers in a PDMS matrix. The oriented PZT nanofibers
were electrospun onto parallel metal wires. The performance parameters
of the nanogenerator were investigated under bending motions. The
output voltage increased with the PZT thickness, which means that
it originated from the purely piezoelectric effect without any triboelectric
effect, whereas the output current increased with the PZT thickness
and area. An output voltage of 1.1 V and output current of 1.4 μA
were obtained with a PZT thickness of 80 μm and an area of 8
cm2. The piezoelectric output performance was found to
depend on the fibers’ orientation direction and the bending
direction. The piezoelectric output of a device in which the bending
direction and fiber orientation were parallel rapidly increased at
large strains, and a mechanism was proposed to describe this behavior.
We have shown that the output voltage and the current depend on the
strain rate, but the total amount of generated charge was independent
of the strain rate.

Methods
Preparation of the PZT
Nanofiber Textiles
PZT nanofiber
textiles were prepared using the electrospinning method.28,36 A solution containing 4.8 g of anhydrous ethanol, 2.0 g of acetylacetone,
and 7.0 g of acetic acid was mixed and stirred for 5 min using a magnetic
stirrer. Acetic acid was added to the solution as a chelating agent.
Next, 1.25 g of tetrabutyltitanate, 1.862 g of zirconium acetylacetonate,
and 2.06 g of lead subacetate were dissolved sequentially in the solution.
Complete dissolution was achieved by stirring the resulting solution
for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, 0.3 g of PVP (MW = 1 300 000, Aldrich) was added to the
precursor solution to obtain a suitable viscosity for the spinning
process.

The final PVP-containing PZT precursor solution was
electrospun under an electric field of 10 kV with a feed rate of 15
μL min–1. The relative humidity and temperature
were 40% and 25 °C, respectively. The distance between the needle
tip and the collector was 10 cm. The electrospun PZT nanofibers were
collected onto a parallel multipair stainless steel wire to obtain
the aligned PZT textile, as shown in Figure 1a. The radius of the stainless steel wires
was 0.1 mm, and the gap between the wires was 4 mm. The dielectrophoresis
forces caused by the applied voltages pull the nanowires toward the
electrodes. The direction of the force is dependent on the field gradient
rather than the field direction. Electrostatic forces attract the
nanowires toward the parallel electrode surface and repel each other
to avoid trapping two or more nanowires between one electrode pair.37−39 The as-spun PZT textile was carefully peeled off from the wire collector,
and the as-spun PZT textile was annealed in two steps: first, it was
annealed at 150 °C for 30 min to remove residual stress from
the textile.35,36 Next, the temperature was increased
to 650 °C at a rate of 3 °C min–1 and
further calcined in air for 3 h to remove the residual PVP polymer.
During the calcination and cooling processes, PZT formed a polycrystalline
phase. The composition ratio of PZT after calcination was determined
as PbZr0.52Ti0.48.

Device Fabrication
A piece of the
calcined PZT textile
was placed on a cleaned ITO-PEN (Peccell Technology Inc., Japan) substrate.
PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Corp.) was then spread onto the PZT
textile, and the assembly was placed in a vacuum desiccator for 30
min to allow the PDMS to infiltrate the fibers and remove air bubbles
from micropores in the PZT/PDMS composite.33,34 A second ITO-PEN substrate was placed on top of the PZT/PDMS composite
layer, and the assembly was cured in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h
in air. During the curing process, the assembled devices were lightly
pressed to squeeze out excess PDMS and reduce the thickness of the
PZT/PDMS composite to the thickness of the PZT. Finally, a Cu wire
was connected using a Ag epoxy paste at each end of the ITO-PEN electrodes
and poled under an electric field of 7.5 kV/mm at 100 °C for
12 h in an oil bath.

Characterization
The morphologies
and microstructures
of the PZT nanofibers were analyzed by field-emission SEM (FE-SEM,
Hitachi S-4100) and HR-TEM (Tecnai F20 G2). The crystal
structures of the PZT nanofibers were investigated using an X-ray
diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE). The output voltage and the output current
were recorded using an analog signal recorder (e-Corder 401) and a
current amplifier (Stanford Research SR-570). The flexible PZT nanogenerator
was subjected to a constant strain by a motorized bending machine.
