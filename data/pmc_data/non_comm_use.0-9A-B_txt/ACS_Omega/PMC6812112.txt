1 Introduction
In 1969, Rosenberg and
co-workers reported the first results concerning
the cytotoxicity of platinum compounds against murine tumors,1 which initiated a new area of medicinal chemistry
dealing with metal-containing antitumor agents. Currently, platinum-based
compounds such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are widely
used in medical practice.2 Although cisplatin
and its derivatives have been successfully included into the armory
of anticancer chemotherapeutical agents, there are problems related
to their high toxicity and low selectivity to malignant tumors and,
in some cases, drug resistance of cancer cells. This stimulates extensive
studies aimed at the development of new metal derivatives that would
be free from the indicated drawbacks.3 Among
non-platinum compounds, researchers are focused on less toxic copper-based
compounds.4 The properties exhibited by
complexes are substantially dependent on the nature of ligands and
the donor atoms that are coordinated to the metal.5

The relationship between the structure and biological
activity
of copper complexes has been investigated for as long as more than
5 decades. The biological activities of many copper compounds is governed
by the chelating properties of the ligands towards transition-metal
ions.6 It is also known that metal-ion
chelates show a much better uptake by living organisms than free metal
ions. However, many issues concerning the behavior of copper ions
in the intracellular space remain unsolved: it is absolutely unknown
whether or not the structure of sophisticated complexes is retained
in the cell as the copper ion is released and what happens when the
copper valence changes from Cu(II) to Cu(I).7 An increase in the copper-ion concentration inside the cells is
known to induce general intoxication to inhibit the DNA synthesis
and oxidative phosphorylation, and also to result in total thiol oxidation
to disulfides.8 The biological effects
of copper complexes are highly diversified and selective, and all
this complicates the search for and systematization of literature
sources. All of the listed issues can apparently attest to the high
diversity of biological effects of these compounds.

A fairly
important factor for the design of modern antitumor compounds
is the selection of the molecular target, most often, an enzyme that
performs a key function in tumor cells. It is known that many copper
complexes with bipyridine ligands that exhibit antitumor activity
are effective inhibitors of topoisomerases, that is, key cell cycle
enzymes.4,5 Recently, it was also shown in a number
of works that 5Z,9Z-dienoic acids
are efficient nonspecific inhibitors of human topoisomerase.9

In view of the foregoing, we hypothesized
that copper carboxylates
with pyridine ligands based on 5Z,9Z-dienoic acids could also exhibit high cytotoxicity via targeted
action on topoisomerases.

This communication presents preliminary
results on the synthesis
of copper bipyridine complexes based on 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid, which exhibited the highest inhibitory
activity toward topoisomerase I, and study of its antitumor properties
in vitro on several tumor cell lines of various etiology by means
of flow cytofluorometry.

2 Results and Discussion
The complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridyl,
5,9-eicd is 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic
acid) 1 was synthesized by the reaction of Cu(OAc)2·H2O with 2,2′-bipyridine (2 equiv)
and 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid (1
equiv) in methanol by a modified procedure (Figure 1).10 A similar
copper complex based on arachidic acid, Cu(bpy)2(arach)
(bpy is 2,2′-bipyridyl, arach is arachidic acid) 2, was prepared as a reference compound (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of complexes Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
(1) and Cu(bpy)2(arach) (2).

We studied the ability of the compounds Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
(bpy: 2,2′-bipyridyl, 5,9-eicd: 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid) 1 and Cu(bpy)2(arach) (bpy: 2,2′-bipyridyl, arach: arachidic acid) 2 synthesized in this work to inhibit topoisomerase I.

The results presented in Figure 2A,B indicate that the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid
DNA with inhibition of topoisomerase I (Topogen) by the complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) (in this case, 3 enzyme units of topoisomerase
I are inhibited by 2 nM the test compound) results in decrease in
the residual amount of the supercoiled plasmid DNA and increase in
the number of formed topoisomers (lanes 2–10) as the concentration
of the test compound is increased from 1 to 100 nM. When the compound
concentration is in the range from 1 to 20 nM, the supercoiled plasmid
is predominantly accumulated upon addition of ethidium bromide to
the gel (Figure 1B,
samples 8–12), while at concentrations above 20 nM (Figure 2B, samples 3–5),
the level of the open circular form increases. These results lead
to the conclusion that Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) suppresses the
topo I catalytic activity; however, its action is dose-dependent,
and in concentrations of 20 nM and higher, it can also influence the
formation of covalent complexes of DNA with topo I. Compound 2 did not show an inhibitory effect on the enzyme topoisomerase
I. Thus, the synthesized copper complex has more than 10 times higher
human topoisomerase inhibitory activity than the initial unsaturated
acid.

The quantitative and
qualitative analyses of cell viability, cell
cycle, and apoptosis-inducing activity of Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
(bpy is 2,2′-bipyridyl, 5,9-eicd is 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid) were performed by means of Guava Nexin
Reagent, Guava Cell Cycle, and Guava ViaCount kits (Millipore).

The cytotoxic activity of the complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
(bpy is 2,2′-bipyridyl, 5,9-eicd is 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid) in vitro against the Jurkat, HL-60,
K562, and U937 human leukemia cells and HEK293 kidney cancer cells
was tested using the Guava ViaCount kit (Millipore) (Table 1).

The complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) in concentrations
from
0.05 to 0.22 μM exhibited a clearly pronounced cytotoxic effect
against all types of cancer cells used in the tests. However, the
highest CC50 value was found for the A2780cis cell line
(0.47 μM), whereas the CC50 values for Jurkat, K562,
HL-60, and U937 cells were 0.05, 0.1, and 0.08 μM, respectively.
It is noteworthy that the arachidic acid-based copper complex 2 and cisplatin taken as reference compounds showed substantially
lower antitumor activities in vitro than complex 1 (Table 1).

It should
be noted that the synthesized compounds exhibit good
selectivity index (SI) (SI = CC50 fibroblasts/CC50 cancer cells); in particular for compound 1, the selectivity
index varies from 2 to 18 with respect to all tumor cells.

The
Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)-induced apoptosis in the Jurkat,
HL-60, K562, U937, and HEK293 cell cultures was estimated by the detection
of phosphatidylserine externalization on the plasmatic membrane after
treatment of cell cultures with the test compound. It is worth noting
that the effect of the complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) on the
induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells is more pronounced than in
other types of cells, which is in line with the higher cytotoxicity
of this compound against this cell line. As can be seen from Figure 3, the action of Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) on the HEK293 tumor cell culture induces a substantial
dose-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells occurring
at early and late apoptosis stages. The highest percentage of early
and late apoptosis (∼91%) was observed at a compound concentration
of 0.1 μM. In particular, as shown in Figure 3, both early and late apoptosis stages for
the Jurkat cells increase as compared with HL60 (p ≤ 0.0003), U937 (p ≤ 0.0005), HEK293
(p ≤ 0.0007), and K562 (p ≤ 0.00019).

Figure 3 HEK293 cells treated with different concentrations of
complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) were double-stained with annexine
V/PI and analyzed
by flow cytometry. (A) Control; (B) 1 (0.025 μM);
(C) 1 (0.05 μM); and (D) 1 (0.1 μM).

Under conventional light microscopic examination,
HEK293 cells
treated with the complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) differed from
the control untreated sample by the presence of clear-cut morphological
changes. The complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) induced nuclear
condensation and apoptotic body formation. These morphological changes,
characteristic of early apoptosis, were visible as soon as 3 h after
treatment. Figure 4 shows cells with different concentrations of the test compound after
24 h of exposure.

To find out whether the retarding effect exerted by complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) is caused by the cell cycle arrest, we studied
the distribution of cell cycle phases for five cell lines, Jurkat,
HL60, K562, and U937, and the adhesion cell culture HEK293 after the
appropriate treatment with the test compound by flow cytometry. According
to cell cycle studies by the Guava Cell Cycle Reagent, the complex
Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) proved to be a potent inducer of hypodiploid
cell population (sub-G1 phase) in all five cell lines. As shown in Figure 5, incubation of Jurkat
cells for 24, 48, or 72 h after treatment with the complex resulted
in 14.37 ± 1.02, 19.35 ± 1.33, or 35.99 ± 2.38% of
hypodiploid cells, respectively. The percentage of cells in the G1
phase decreased compared with the control from 67.57 to 16.39%, whereas
the percentage of cells in the S-phase substantially increased (from
27.50 to 47.69%) in the samples incubated for 72 and 48 h. These results
indicate that the complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) arrests the
cell cycle in the S phase depending on the time of incubation.

Figure 5 Results of
cell-cycle analysis by flow cytometry and representative
of the profiles of cell cycle distribution in three independent experiments
is shown. Jurkat cells treated with complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)

percentage of Jurkat cells after staining with propidium iodide. Data
are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent
experiments.

It was shown that the complex
Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) is
absorbed rather rapidly by cancer cells and induces apoptosis phenomena
as soon as after a 3 h incubation. The presence of the 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid moiety in this complex markedly
increases the stability and lipophilicity of the molecule, which may
be significant for penetration through the tumor cell membrane. The
complex Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) showed an exceptionally high
cytotoxicity on a panel of five tumor cell lines, the IC 50 values
being in the range from 0.05 to 0.22 μM; this is an order of
magnitude lower than this value for cisplatin.

It was found
that compound 1 significantly reduces
the proliferative activity and viability of cisplatin-resistant A2780cis
cells, as shown in a study of the cytotoxicity of the compounds under
study (Table 1). According
to real-time cell analysis (RTCA), Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) is
a substance that exhibits a strong inhibitory effect even at the lowest
concentration on A2870cis-resistant ovarian cancer cells on cisplatin
cells (Figure 6). At
the same time, cisplatin itself, added at a concentration of 1 μM
(CC50 = 0.94 ± 0.028 for A2780cis cells), also slightly
reduces the proliferative ability of the A2870cis line in the first
two days; however, by the third day, the cells regain their ability
to grow, which is confirmed by an increase in cell index (CI).

Figure 6 Effect of different
sample concentrations of cisplatin and Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
on real-time cell analyzer curves xCELLigence RTCA
system generated with A2870cis cells. Effect of cisplatin 0.5 μM/mL
(blue line), cisplatin 1.0 μM (gray line), Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) 0.3 μM (turquoise line), Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd)
0.5 μM (green line), Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) 1.0 μM
(purple line), and control (red line, control group: untreated cells).

Thus, it can be argued that the introduction of 1 into
the culture medium reduced the proliferation and viability of cisplatin-resistant
ovarian cancer for four days, indicating a potential antiproliferative
effect of 1 for cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

The ability of the complex 1 to inhibit topoisomerase
I results in disruption of DNA synthesis, inhibition of transcription,
and initiation of apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway. These results
shed light on the key molecular mechanisms that underlie the anticancer
activity of Cu(bpy)2(5,9-eicd) and are important for the
development of DNA-specific copper complexes as antitumor drug candidates.

3 Conclusions
Thus, the newly synthesized copper complex
(bipy)2Cu(5,9-eicd)
based on 5Z,9Z-eicosadienoic acid
and 2,2′-bipyridine shows a high antitumor activity in vitro
toward Hek293, K562, HL60, Jurkat, and U937 cell lines, being more
efficient than the known anticancer drug cisplatin. Furthermore, (bipy)2Cu(5,9-eicd) was found to arrest the cell cycle in the S phase,
depending on the incubation time, and to act as an efficient human
topoisomerase I inhibitor, which can help to make assumptions on the
possible mechanism of its antitumor activity.

Section
4.1 General (Instruments)
Chromatographic
analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-9A instrument using a 2000
× 2 mm column, the SE-30 (5%) stationary phase on Chromaton N-AW-HMDS
(0.125–0.160 mm), helium carrier gas (30 mL/min), and temperature
programming from 50 to 300 °C at a 8 °C/min rate. IR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70V FTIR spectrometer using KBr disks
over the range of 400–4000 cm–1. Melting
points were recorded on a Stuart SMP3 advanced digital melting point
apparatus. The 1H- and 13C NMR spectra were
recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (100.62
MHz for 13C, 400.00 MHz for 1H). High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were measured on a Bruker maXis instrument using
electrospray ionization.11 In experiments
on selective collisional activation (CAD), activation energy was set
at the maximum abundance of fragment peaks (see figures legend). A
syringe injection was used for solutions in MeCN–H2O, 50/50 vol % (flow rate 3 mL/min). Nitrogen was applied as a dry
gas; interface temperature was set at 180 °C. Elemental analysis
of the samples was determined by elemental analyzer firm KarloErba,
model 1106. Reactions with organometallic compounds were performed
in a dry argon flow. The solvents were dried and distilled immediately
prior to use. Commercially available Cu(OAc)2, 2,2′-bipyridine,
and arachidic acid (Aldrich) were used. 5Z,9Z-Eicosadienoic acid was synthesized according previously
published technique.9g

4.3 Biology
4.3.1 Cell Culture
Cells (Jurkat, K562,
U937) were purchased from Russian Cell Culture Collection (Institute
of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences) and cultured according
to standard mammalian tissue culture protocols and sterile technique.
Human cancer cell lines HL60, HEK293, A2780cis, and A2780 were obtained
from the HPA Culture Collections (U.K.). All cell lines used in the
study were tested and shown to be free of mycoplasma and viral contamination.12

HEK293 and fibroblasts cell line was cultured
as monolayers and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Cells were maintained
in the DMEM medium (adherent cell culture
HEK293, A2780cis, A2780, and fibroblasts) or RPMI 1640 (Jurkat, K562,
and U937) (Gibco) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 10% FBS (Sigma),
and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). HL60 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS. All types of cells were grown
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were
subcultured at 2–3 days intervals. Adherent cells HEK293, fibroblasts,
and A2870cis were suspended using trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid and counted after they have reached 80% confluency. Cells were
then seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per
well and incubated overnight. Jurkat, HL-60, K562, and U937 cells
were subcultured at 2 day intervals with a seeding density of 1 ×
105 cells per 24-well plates in RPMI with 10% FBS or 20%
FBS for HL60 cells.13

4.3.2 Cytotoxicity Assay
Viability (live/dead)
assessment was performed by staining cells with 7-aminoactinomycin
D (Biolegend). After treatment, the cells were harvested, washed 1–2
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μL
of flow cytometry staining buffer (PBS without Ca2+ and
Mg2+, 2, 5% FBS) and stained with 5 μL of 7-AAD staining
solution for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were
acquired on NovoCyte 2000 FlowCytometry System (ACEA) equipped with
488 nm argon laser. Detection of 7-AAD emission was collected through
a 675/30 nm filter in the FL4 channel.14

4.3.3 Viability and Apoptosis
Apoptosis
was determined by flow cytometric analysis of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin
D staining. Briefly, 200 μL of Guava Nexin reagent (Millipore,
Bedford, MA) was added to 5 × 105 cells in 200 μL,
and the cells were incubated with the reagent for 20 min at room temperature
in the dark. At the end of incubation, the cells were analyzed on
NovoCyte 2000 flow cytometry system (ACEA).15

4.3.4 Cell Cycle Analysis
Cell cycle
was analyzed using the method of propidium iodide staining. Briefly,
the cells were plated in 24-well round-bottom plates at a density
10 × 105 cells per well, centrifuged at 450g for 5 min, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 24
h at 0 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with
250 μL of Guava Cell Cycle Reagent (Millipore) for 30 min at
room temperature in the dark. Samples were analyzed on NovoCyte 2000
flow cytometry system (ACEA).15

4.3.5 DNA Topoisomerase I Assay
The inhibitory
activity of Cu complexes 1, 2 were determined
using the Topoisomerase I Drug Screening Kit TG-1018-2 using protocol
by Topogen.

4.3.6 Real-Time Cell Analysis
(RTCA)
Eight thousand A2780cis culture Cells were seeded
in two 8-well plates
with an integrated microelectronic sensor array in 600 μL of
culture medium (iCELLigence real-time cell analyzer; ACEA Biosciences,
San Diego, CA). After 24 h, the drugs were added for a total volume
of 100 μL. The cell proliferation and survival were monitored
in real-time by measuring the cell to electrode responses of the seeded
cells. In each individual E-well, the cell impedance was measured
and converted to cell index (CI) values by the RTCA software version
1.2 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The graphs were generated in real time
by the iCELLigence system. Untreated and DMSO treated cells served
as controls.16
