We have examined
the photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3 supported
on Al2O3 (Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst) without a noble metal
cocatalyst for water splitting and reduction of CO2 with
water under UV light irradiation by changing the loading amount of
Ga2O3. All prepared Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts show photocatalytic activities
for both water splitting and CO2 reduction, and their activities
are significantly improved compared to those of nonsupported Ga2O3 and Al2O3. The water splitting
is dominated for Ga2O3/Al2O3 with less than 1.0 vol % of Ga2O3 loaded,
whereas the CO2 reduction, for higher Ga2O3-loaded samples (2.6, 4.2 vol %). Crystalline structure characterizations
of Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts
indicate that active sites for both reactions are different. The water
splitting proceeds on nanometer-sized Ga2O3 rods
dispersed on an Al2O3 support consisting of
a little distorted α-Ga2O3 phase. On the
other hand, the CO2 reduction proceeds on sub-micrometer-sized
Ga2O3 particles consisting of mixed phases of
α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 or with appearance of boundaries between the α and
γ phases, which plays a critical role. Al2O3 used as the support of the Ga2O3 particles
does not seem to play an important role in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Introduction
Recently, Ga2O3 has
attracted a lot of interest
as a photocatalyst for water splitting and CO2 reduction
with water and various efforts have been paid to improve its photocatalytic
activity.1−4 Yamamoto et al. have reported improvement of photocatalytic activity
for CO2 reduction with water under UV irradiation using
Ag as a cocatalyst.4−6 Teramura et al. have succeeded in improving photocatalytic
activity for the CO2 reduction by cation (Zn, Pr, or Yb)
doping into Ga2O3 with a Ag cocatalyst.7−9 However, both the mechanism and the role of the Ag cocatalyst for
these photocatalytic reactions have not been well understood. Although
Kato et al.10−12 have succeeded in nitrogen doping into Ga2O3 to induce photocatalytic activity under visible light
irradiation, the activity has remained at a lower level.

In
the present study, we have focused on geometrical or morphological
effects of Ga2O3 particles supported on Al2O3 (referred as Ga2O3/Al2O3 hereafter) for water splitting and CO2 reduction under UV light irradiation without using the Ag cocatalyst.
The reasons for utilization of Al2O3 as the
support are 2-fold: (1) It increases the surface area of Ga2O3,13,14 as evidenced by the observation
that Ga2O3/Al2O3 was used
for the removal of NOx.15,16 (2) Al2O3 hardly shows photocatalytic activity
for both water splitting and CO2 reduction. Ga2O3 supported on Al2O3 (Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples) was produced by
loading of Ga2O3 particles on γ-Al2O3 particles by an impregnation method.17 By changing the loading amount of Ga2O3, i.e., changing the mass or volume ratio of Ga2O3 and Al2O3, their photocatalytic
activities for both water splitting and CO2 reduction were
examined. All prepared Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples have shown significantly higher photocatalytic activity
compared to that of pure Ga2O3 (nonsupported
Ga2O3). The cause of the improvement is discussed
considering detailed characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption fine
structure (XAFS) and morphological observation using field emission
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).

Results
Photocatalytic
Reduction of CO2 with Water over the
Ga2O3/Al2O3 Samples
Figure 1 compares
production rates of H2, O2, and CO for all samples
that were taken after 5 h of the reaction test showing a nearly steady
state. They are also given in Table 1. The production rates of H2, CO, and O2 almost retained the stoichiometric ratio.18 Although we prepared the samples with a wt % base; hereafter,
we have converted wt % to vol % and discussed all things on the basis
of vol % for an easy discussion and understanding hereafter. As seen
in the figure, the H2 production rates of all samples were
higher than those with unsupported Ga2O3 and
the rates increased with the loaded amount of Ga2O3 and after reaching the maximum, decreased with increasing
the loaded amount of Ga2O3. The CO production
rate changed in a completely different way from that of H2 production. This indicates that H2 production and CO
production proceeded independently, which is discussed later. Although
all samples except pure Al2O3 were active for
the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, samples with the loaded
amount of Ga2O3 less than 1 vol % showed a lesser
CO production rate and CO selectivity remained small compared to those
of unsupported Ga2O3 (100 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3). Samples loaded with more
than 2 vol % Ga2O3 showed a higher reaction
rate than that of unsupported ones. Ga2O3/Al2O3 (2.6 vol %) showed the maximum CO production
rate, which was 2.7 times larger than that of the unsupported Ga2O3. This is a significant improvement of the photocatalytic
activity of Ga2O3 without a cocatalyst.

Characterization
Crystalline Structure
Figure 2A shows
changes of XRD patterns with Ga2O3 loading amounts
plotted against a diffraction
angle of 2θ for all prepared samples. Figure 2B shows the magnified XRD patterns. As seen
in Figure 2B, the two
peaks within 42–50° attributed to Al2O3 did not show any shifts.19 This
suggests that loaded Ga2O3 hardly dissolved
into Al2O3, although Ga2O3 and Al2O3 are fully dissolvable with each
other according to the phase diagram.20 Hence, in Figure 3 are shown difference XRD spectra, i.e., the intensity of XRD peaks
of Al2O3 subtracted from the observed intensity
of XRD peaks of the samples. As indicated in the figure, most of the
XRD peaks of Ga2O3 were assigned to either α,
β, or γ phase. This confirms that Ga2O3 hardly dissolved into Al2O3 and vice
versa but was loaded or deposited on Al2O3.21

Results of the XRD analysis are summarized as follows: lower
Ga2O3-loaded samples (less than 1 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3) consisted of a
single
phase α-Ga2O3. However, the lowest Ga2O3-loaded sample (0.15 vol %) does not seem well
crystallized but is close to amorphous or its particle size would
be very small. The crystallinity of Ga2O3 particles
on Al2O3 became better on increasing the loading
amount. Higher Ga2O3-loaded samples (more than
2 vol %) consisted of mixed phases α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3. It should be noted that
unsupported Ga2O3 (100% vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3) consisted of three phases
α, β, and γ.

Figure 4A shows k3-weighted
Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra. Fourier
transformation was performed on each EXAFS spectrum in the range from
3 to 12 Å–1, and the radial structure function
(RSF) was obtained as shown in Figure 4B. In RSFs, the first peak appearing at 1–2
Å is assigned to the backscattering from an adjacent oxygen atom
to a Ga atom (Ga–O bond). The second peak at around 2.7 Å
mainly showed the presence of the second-neighboring gallium atoms
(Ga–(O)–Ga bond).10,17,22 It should be noted that 0.15 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3 showed a high-intensity peak at around 1.5 Å.
However, the peak intensity is too high to be caused simply by Ga–O
bonds, suggesting some contribution of O bond to Al (Al–O–Ga).
Probably because the deposited Ga2O3 particles
are too small to be completely crystallized, their crystal structure,
i.e., bonding lengths of Ga–O in surface layers neighboring
to the Al2O3 support, should be distorted owing
to a difference in atomic distances of Ga–O and Al–O.
The RSF of lesser Ga2O3-loaded samples (under
0.73 vol %) showed a shoulder at around 3.5 Å, and a broad peak
appeared at around 4–5 Å. Since both were clearly observed
in α-Ga2O3, the Ga2O3 crystal phase should be dominated with the α phase, agreeing
with the result of XRD. However, the peak of the first coordination
region is much higher than that of α-Ga2O3. This could be attributed to the distortion of the α-Ga2O3 by the supporting Al2O3. The RSF of higher Ga2O3-loaded samples (above
2.6 vol %) showed a shoulder peak at around 0.8 Å in addition
to the 3.5 Å shoulder. Since the 0.8 Å shoulder or peak
was prominent in γ-Ga2O3, higher Ga2O3-loaded samples are confirmed to consist of α
and γ phases, as observed by the XRD.

Figure 5 shows
field
emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of the samples
taken in a backscattered electron mode, of which the contrast well
corresponds to the weight of constituent atoms of the sample. The
images clearly distinguish columnar-like Ga2O3 particles (around 100 nm in length and a few nanometer in width)
from supporting Al2O3 ones with micrometer size.
One can see that for lesser Ga2O3-loaded samples
(less than 1 vol %), number density of the Ga2O3 particles increased on increasing the loaded Ga2O3 amount, whereas for higher loaded samples, the particle size
grew and certain areas of Al2O3 were hindered.
These images are quite consistent with the characterization of XRD
and EXAFS.

Diffuse Reflectance UV–Vis Spectra
Figure 6 compares diffuse
reflectance UV–vis spectra for all samples. On increasing the
loaded amount of Ga2O3, the absorption edge
shifted to the longer wavelength region and the shifts were saturated
above 2.6 vol % very close to 100 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3. However, for lower Ga2O3-loaded samples (less than 1 vol %), the red shift of their
absorption edge was not appreciable. A small amount of dissolution
of Al2O3 having wider band gap into nanometer-sized
Ga2O3 rods would result distortion of their
α-Ga2O3 phase and consequently inhibit
their band gap narrowing.

Table 1 summarizes
production rates of H2, O2, and CO, together
with crystal structures and BET specific surface areas for all samples
tested. The surface area decreased with the increase of the loading
amount of Ga2O3 except that of 4.2 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Chemical Nature
of Ga in Surface Layers
XPS Analysis
Figure 7A shows Ga 3d XPS spectra for the samples.
The binding
energy of the XPS spectra were corrected, referring to the Al 2p XPS
peak shown in Figure 7B. For lesser Ga2O3-loaded samples (less than
1 vol %), the intensity of Ga 3d peaks was very weak. Nevertheless,
the intensity gradually increased on increasing the loaded amount
of Ga2O3. For higher Ga2O3-loaded samples (higher than 2 vol %), the Ga 3d peak became significant.
The intensity of Al 2p XPS peaks decreased continuously without changing
their shapes and positions. From the peak intensities of Ga 3d and
Al 2p, the atomic fractions of Ga near the surface region of all samples
were determined and plotted against the loaded amount of Ga2O3 in vol %. The figure clearly shows that for lesser
Ga2O3-loaded samples, the atomic fraction linearly
increased with the volume fraction of Ga2O3.
This indicates that the coverage of Ga2O3 on
Al2O3 linearly increased. Over 2 vol % loading,
the coverage became large enough to hinder some parts of the Al2O3 surface, as seen in Figure 5, and accordingly, the Ga atom fraction near
the surface significantly increased, as appears in Figure 8.

X-ray Absorption Near Edge
Structure (XANES) Analysis
Figure 9 shows Ga
L3-edge XANES spectra. The peak appearing near 1123 eV
is caused by a Ga–O–Al bond.16,23,24 For lesser Ga2O3-loaded
samples, this peak was relatively high compared with other peaks.
This indicates that some interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 occurred in lesser loaded samples,
as already suggested in the EXAFS analysis. For higher Ga2O3-loaded samples, the peak intensity at 1123 eV became
less and the spectrum transformed to that of Ga2O3, showing loaded Ga2O3 as well crystallized.
Thus, the result of XANES analysis is quite consistent with that of
EXAFS and XPS analyses.

samples. The
spectrum of β-Ga2O3 is also given for
comparison. (a) 0.15 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3, (b) 0.32 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3, (c) 0.73 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3, (d) 2.6 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3, (e) 4.2 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3, and (f) 100 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3. The peaks appearing at 1123 eV are
assigned to be caused by Ga–O–Al bond formation.

Discussion
As
indicated in Figure 1 and Table 1, all
Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples
showed higher photocatalytic activity compared to that of unsupported
Ga2O3 for both water splitting and CO2 reduction without a cocatalyst. Furthermore, the water splitting
seems to proceed in a different way from the CO2 reduction.
In the following discussion, we separately discuss the mechanism and
the active sites for the water splitting and CO2 reduction.

It should be noted that BET surface area was the largest for Al2O3 whereas the least for Ga2O3. As depicted in FE-SEM images (Figure 5), the surface of the loaded Ga2O3 particles seems smoother than that of Al2O3. Consequently, the BET surface area decreased on increasing
the loaded amount of Ga2O3 or surface coverage
of Al2O3 by Ga2O3 and
was not directly correlated to the photocatalytic activities. This
means that the role of Al2O3 in the photocatalytic
reaction is not straightforward but just supporting Ga2O3 and assisting dispersive precipitation of small Ga2O3 particles.

Water Splitting
The water splitting
was dominated for
lesser Ga2O3-loaded samples (less than 1.0 vol
%). In these samples, columnar Ga2O3 particles
(around 10–300 nm in length and less than 10 nm in width) consisting
of the α phase were precipitated on supporting Al2O3 particles (larger than micrometer). On increasing the
loaded amount of Ga2O3, its areal density increased
without changing its shape (see Figure 5). This indicates that the active sites for water splitting
should be on the surface of the precipitated α-Ga2O3 of which the deposited density increased with the loaded
amount of Ga2O3. As EXAFS and XANES analyses
showed, the crystalline structure of the α phase of the Ga2O3 particles is likely distorted by supporting
Al2O3. Such small distortion in the α
phase could be effective for photocatalytic water splitting.

The H2 production rates in Figure 1 are magnified in Figure 10. Since the production rate continuously
decreased on increasing the deposited amounts of Ga2O3, smaller sizes of the α-Ga2O3 particles, hence probably having larger distortion, are much effective
for the water splitting. This supports that distortion of the α
phase is a critically important factor for the catalytic activity.

Figure 10 H2 production rate against the loaded amount of Ga2O3 given in vol %.

For higher Ga2O3-loaded samples, precipitated
particle sizes grew with the loaded amount, resulting in a decrease
of the surface-to-volume ratio of the particles and consequently decreasing
the number of active sites as a whole. In addition, the larger precipitated
particles for the larger Ga2O3-loaded samples
were dominated with α and γ phases (see Table 1). In other words, larger sizes
of Ga2O3 particles prefer to take thermally
more stable γ and β phases than the α phase and
accordingly they lose the active sites for water splitting.

From all above observations, for water splitting under UV irradiation,
we can conclude that the higher photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3 particles supported on Al2O3 is caused by dispersive precipitation of nanometer-sized Ga2O3 rods consisting of a little distorted α
phase on the Al2O3 support.

It should
be mentioned that because the UV–vis absorption
of these less Ga2O3-loaded samples were weak
and their band gap remained narrow (see Figure 6), a number of electron–hole pairs
that enable CO2 reduction are not likely produced enough
under the present UV condition. This does not change the above conclusion.

CO2 Reduction
Active sites for CO2 reduction
seem totally different from those for water splitting.
In Figure 11, CO production
rates and CO selectivity are replotted. One can clearly see that lesser
Ga2O3-loaded samples were inactive for photocatalytic
reduction of CO2. Their activities were less than those
of the unsupported Ga2O3. Other samples active
for the CO2 reduction consisted of two phases α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3. Thus,
we can conclude that for the CO2 reduction, larger Ga2O3 particles consisting of the α and γ
phases play an important role, whereas the α-Ga2O3 phase in nanorods dispersed on Al2O3 is inactive.

Figure 11 CO production rate and selectivity toward CO evolution
in the photocatalytic
reduction of CO2 with H2O for the Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples together with those
of nonsupported Ga2O3, α-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3.

It is also important to note that 2.6 vol % Ga2O3/Al2O3 showed the maximum
activity.
As seen in Figure 3 (XRD spectra), on increasing the loaded amount of Ga2O3, the γ phase became dominant and crystallized
well. Since the catalytic activity of both unsupported α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 was
far less than that of the supported ones, well-crystallized single-phase
(α or γ) particles on Al2O3 are
not likely to have high catalytic activity. Since the BET surface
areas of the active samples were similar to each other, the difference
of the activity is not likely caused by the surface area or the surface
roughness. This indicates that crystallinity of the Ga2O3 particles on Al2O3 must play
an important role, i.e., coexistence of both α and γ phases
would be the key. Stronger UV–vis absorption and narrower band
gap of the larger Ga2O3-loaded samples compared
to those of less loaded samples would also contribute to enhance the
activity.

Boundaries between the two different phases of Ga2O3 were claimed as active sites for photocatalytic
CO2 reduction.25−28 The present results also suggest the importance of
the boundary.
The ratio of the integrated length of all boundaries to the integrated
surface areas of all particles is 1/r (2πr/πr2 = 1/r) and decreases on increasing the radius (r). This
could be a reason for the activity reduction for higher Ga2O3 contents seen in Figure 11.

Conclusions
We
have examined photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3 loaded on an Al2O3 support (Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst) for water
splitting and CO2 reduction with water under UV light irradiation
without a noble metal cocatalyst. Since on changing the loaded amount
of Ga2O3, the geometrical structure or morphology
of loaded Ga2O3 could be controlled, effects
of these changes on the photocatalytic activity for water splitting
and CO2 reduction were investigated.

All Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples
showed higher photocatalytic activity compared to that of unsupported
Ga2O3 for both water splitting and CO2 reduction without a cocatalyst. The water splitting seems to proceed
in a different way from the CO2 reduction. The former is
preferred by lower Ga2O3-loaded samples (less
than 1 vol % Ga2O3), whereas the latter, by
higher loaded ones (2.6 and 4.2 vol % Ga2O3).

For lesser Ga2O3-loaded samples, nanometer-sized
Ga2O3 rods consisting of α-Ga2O3 phase were dispersively precipitated on Al2O3 support. On increasing the loading amount, the areal
density of the precipitated rods increased without appreciable change
in their shape. Correspondingly, the production rate of H2 linearly increased with the amount of loaded Ga2O3. The α-Ga2O3 phase of the nanorods
is very likely distorted by the influence of supporting Al2O3 both in chemical nature and crystallinity and works
as active sites for the water splitting.

For higher Ga2O3-loaded samples, active for
the CO2 reduction, sub-micrometer-sized Ga2O3 particles were deposited on the Al2O3 support, which were consisted of α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 and were not likely influenced
by Al2O3. The mixed phases of α and γ
in the sub-micrometer particles play an important role; in particular,
the appearance of boundaries between the α and γ phases
is very likely the key.

It should be noted that the role of
Al2O3 in the photocatalytic reaction is not
straightforward but supporting
Ga2O3 and assisting dispersive precipitation
of small Ga2O3 particles.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of Ga2O3/Al2O3 Photocatalyst
Samples
Ga2O3/Al2O3 photocatalyst samples were prepared
by an impregnation method. Ga(NO3)3·8H2O (Kishida Chemical Co. Ltd. purity 99.0%) and 1.0 g γ-Al2O3 (Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. purity 99.99%) were
added to 200 mL of distilled water and stirred with a magnetic stirrer
in air and dried up, followed by calcination at 823 K for 4 h, resulting
in the Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples.
The loaded amounts of Ga2O3 were 5, 10, 20,
40, and 60 wt %. Pure Al2O3 and unsupported
Ga2O3 samples (referred as 0 and 100 wt %, respectively)
were also prepared with a similar procedure. Unsupported Ga2O3 samples having single phases α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 were also prepared for comparison. α-Ga2O3 was obtained by calcining Ga2O3·nH2O (Mitsuwa Chemicals
Co., Lid Ga2O3 78.8%) at 823 K for 5 h.29 β-Ga2O3 (purity
99.99) was purchased from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd. For
the preparation of γ-Ga2O3, Ga(NO3)3·8H2O was dissolved in ethanol
(approximately 3 g of the reagent in 50 mL of the solvent), and then
an ethanol solution of 28 vol % aqueous ammonia (volume ratio of ethanol/aqueous
ammonia = 1) was added slowly under continuous stirring at room temperature
until no further precipitates were formed. The resultant precipitates
were filtered, washed with ethanol, and vacuum-dried in a desiccator.
Finally, the obtained solid was calcined at 773 K for 5 h to produce
γ-Ga2O3.30

Characterization
Crystalline structures of all Ga2O3/Al2O3 samples were examined
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD patterns of the samples were
recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) using Cu Kα as a radiation
source with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 15 mA. The
XRD patterns were collected at 2θ angles of 20–70°.
The 2θ step size was 0.02°, and the scanning rate was 10°/min.

To examine the surface composition of the sample, XPS measurements
were carried out at room temperature under vacuum using ESCA 3400
(Shimadzu). Mg Kα was used as an X-ray source with an electron
acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a current of 20 mA. Ga K-edge EXAFS
and Ga L3-edge XANES were recorded with the beam line of
BL5S1 at the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center and BL2A at UVSOR,
Institute for Molecular Science in Japan, respectively. Ga K-edge
EXAFS and Ga L3-edge XANES were obtained by a transmission
mode and by a sample current method or total electron yield mode,
respectively. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded
at room temperature using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670). The spectrum
of Ba2SO4 was used as reference.

Morphology
of the samples was observed by a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6500F, JEOL Ltd.) with a backscattered
electron mode under an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. All samples
were subjected to BET specific surface area measurements at 77 K (liq.
N2 temperature) using Monosorb (Quantachrome). Before the
BET measurements, all samples were heated at 573 K for 3 h under a
nitrogen atmosphere.

Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with
Water (CO2 Reduction and Water Splitting Tests)
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O under
UV light irradiation
was tested for 0.1 g of one of the samples set in a fixed-bed flow
reactor cell under CO2 gas flow. The UV light intensity
was 35 mW/cm2 in the range of 254 ± 10 nm. Before
the test, the sample was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 1 h under
CO2 gas flow with the flow rate of 20.0 mL/min. Then, the
reduction test was started, introducing a NaHCO3 aqueous
solution (1.0 M) of 10.0 mL and CO2 gas with a flow rate
at 3.0 mL/min under the UV light irradiation. The reaction products
(CO, H2, and O2) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.
