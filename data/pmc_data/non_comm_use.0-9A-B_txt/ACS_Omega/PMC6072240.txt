The
formation of inclusion complexes between drugs and macrocycles
has proven to be an effective strategy to increase solubilization
and stabilization of the drug, while in several cases improving their
biological activity. In this context, we explored the formation of
an inclusion complex between chemotherapeutic drug Melphalan (Mel)
and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), and studied its effect on Mel alkylating
activity, hydrolysis, and cytotoxicity. The formation of the inclusion
complex (Mel@CB[7]) was proven by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy,
NMR, docking studies, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding
constant for Mel and CB[7] was fairly high at pH 1 ((1.7 ± 0.7)
× 106 M–1), whereas no binding was
observed at neutral pH. The Mel@CB[7] complex showed a slightly decreased
alkylating activity, whereas the cytotoxicity on the HL-60 cell line
was maintained. The formation of the complex did not protect Mel from
hydrolysis, and this result is discussed based on the simulated structure
for the complex.

1 Introduction
Melphalan
(Mel, Scheme 1) is
an antineoplasic drug, which is indicated for the treatment
of multiple myeloma and other types of cancer.1,2 Being
a drug of the family of nitrogen mustards, its antitumoral effect
is related to the alkylation of DNA.3−5 Mel is practically insoluble
in water at neutral pH, and it rapidly hydrolyzes in biological media,
factors that have an impact on its usability. In this context, a supramolecular
approach to improving the overall drug performance, such as the use
of cyclodextrins,6,7 is interesting to explore due
to its demonstrated success in pharmaceutical formulations. For example,
Evomela is an injectable formulation of Mel that uses a modified β-cyclodextrin
(Captisol) to improve its solubility and stability by the formation
of an inclusion complex.8

Scheme 1 Mel and
CB[n]s Chemical Structures
Cyclodextrins show in general low binding affinities,
which is
their main downside as a supramolecular solubilizing agent.6 More recently, the family of cucurbit[n]uril macrocycles (CB[n]s, Scheme 1) has emerged as promising
candidates for drug delivery applications.9−11 Some characteristics
that make CB[n]s notable are their low toxicities,
solubilizing properties, high thermal stability, high binding affinities,
and good solubility in biological fluids.6,9,10,12−16

Previously, a report by Isaacs and collaborators showed that
Mel
and other alkylating agents can be efficiently solubilized by acyclic
CB[n]s,17 which are very
versatile in the binding of several molecules of biomedical relevance.
Nevertheless, there is no information regarding how complexation within
these macrocycles could affect their stability, alkylating activity,
and cytotoxicity. Complexation of drugs by CB[n]s
has stimulated much interest over the past decade,9,10,12,18,19 and there are several interesting reports of
how complexation affects bioactivity and/or biodistribution.11,14−16,2011,14−16,20 Therefore, we were
interested in investigating the formation of a supramolecular complex
between Mel and CB[n]s and if this process would
stabilize it, as it has been shown for several other drugs,21 while maintaining its alkylating activity and
cytotoxic effects. For this study, we chose cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]),
which has a cavity size comparable to that of β-cyclodextrin,
and it has been shown to encapsulate phenylalanine,22,23 which is structurally related to Mel.

2 Results
and Discussion
Absorption spectra of Mel in the absence and
presence of increasing
concentrations of CB[7] show a marked decrease in the absorption band
at 260 nm (Figure 1), which is consistent with the encapsulation of the drug. It must
be noted that these changes were observed at pH 1 (0.1 M HCl) and
no such changes were observed at pH 7(see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). These results indicate that
the protonation state of Mel is essential for binding. Mel possesses
three pKa for 2-chloroethylamino, α-carboxylic,
and α-amino groups of 1.42, 2.75, and 9.17, respectively.24 Because binding was observed only at pH 1, the
protonation of the 2-chloroethylamino and α-amino groups seems
to be essential for a strong binding to the macrocycle. This observation
is consistent with previous reports about the cation–dipole
interactions between the guest and CB[n] portals,
which are lined with carbonyl groups.21,23,25 It is important to note that this interaction with
the portals could lead to pKa shifts when
the drug is encapsulated inside CB[n]s,26−28 which was not evaluated in this work. The fact that there is no
appreciable binding at pH 7 (zwitterionic species) could be related
to a destabilization of the complex because of repulsive interactions
with the negative charge density of the carbonyl groups at the portals
of CB[7].

Figure 1 Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of Mel (16 μM)
upon addition of CB[7] (0–45 μM) in 0.1 M HCl. Inset:
fluorescence emission spectra of the same samples.

Fluorescence emission spectra also showed a noticeable
decrease
in intensity as the concentration of CB[7] in the sample increased
(Figure 1, inset),
which further supports that the formation of an inclusion complex
with CB[7] is taking place.

The binding constant for the Mel@CB[7]
complex obtained from the
fluorescence titrations was (1.7 ± 0.7) × 106 M–1 (Figure 2). The value for the binding constant with CB[7] is
fairly high and falls within the range reported for several benzimidazol-derived
drugs.12 This binding constant (K11) can be related to the solubilizing capacity
of the macrocycle by a phase-solubility diagram ([drug] vs [macrocyle])
assuming a 1:1 binding, as depicted by eq 1. S0 refers to
the intrinsic solubility of the drug, whereas the slope is obtained
from the linear fit of the data.29 1  The solubility of Mel hydrochloride is reported
to be 3.11 mg mL–1;30 thus, considering the K11 obtained for
CB[7] in this work, the simulated slope would be unity. This means
that CB[7] is a very good solubilizing agent for Mel and it is close
to the slopes reported for acyclic CB[n]s (0.81–1.2).17 In comparison, (SBE)7m-β-CD
(Captisol), which possesses a binding constant of 142.7 M–1 with Mel (from phase-solubility diagram), has a simulated slope
of 0.6.30

with CB[7] (0–45
μM) in 0.1 M HCl at 25 °C. The data was fitted to a 1:1
binding model using numerical analysis.31,32

The inclusion of Mel inside the cavity of CB[7]
is further supported
by the 1H NMR spectra (Figure 3), which show strong downfield shifts for
Mel aromatic hydrogens, whereas the signals for the α-carbon
hydrogen and the 2-chloroethyl protons are not changed (see Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information
for the assignment). Residual peaks from the solvent at around 3.2
ppm prevent the observation of the hydrogens of the methylene group;
however, it is clear from the spectra that the aromatic ring is placed
inside the cavity, whereas the rest of the molecule sits outside of
the macrocycle.

complex
(1 equiv of CB[7]) in DCl/D2O (1:20).

This inclusion mode is consistent with molecular docking
studies,
which show the preferential inclusion of the aromatic portion of the
molecule inside CB[7], with the 2-chloroethylamino group and the α-carbon
groups sticking out through the portals (Figure 4). The complex shows favorable binding energy
(−5.64 kcal mol–1), which is in line with
the high binding constant determined experimentally. It must be emphasized
that the value of the binding energy is relative and cannot be correlated
directly with the value of the binding constant. However, it is a
good indication that the complex is fairly stable. The simulations
show that the complex is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds with the
carbonyl groups (Figure 4); although hydrophobic interactions and cation–dipole interactions
between the protonated amino groups and the portals are certainly
contributing to the binding. The docking studies show that the formation
of the complex is less favorable at pH 7 than at pH 1 (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), but
weak interactions in solution cannot be completely ruled out.

Color code for Mel atoms: C, cyan; O, red; N, blue; and H, gray. The
structure of Mel corresponds to the fully protonated form at pH 1.
Hydrogen bonds are indicated in the figure.

Because solvation can largely affect the formation of the
complex
and its conformation over time, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
were performed for 10 ns to assess the stability of the complex (Figure 5). The results show
that Mel remains inside the cavity of CB[7] for the duration of the
simulation and that at least one hydrogen bond is retained throughout
the entire time, with sporadic additional hydrogen bonds being formed.
It is interesting to note that the conformation of the complex changes
very little during the simulation and that the 2-chloroethylamino
group is always positioned at the rim of CB[7]. This conformation
would maintain the alkylating activity of Mel because this group is
responsible for the alkylation of DNA bases.3

of Mel corresponds to the fully protonated form at pH 1.

Alkylating activity is essential for Mel chemotherapeutic
effect.
Therefore, we tested if the complexation of Mel by CB[7] altered such
property by following the generation of a colored product at 545 nm
after reaction with 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP), which is based
on the alkylation of the pyridine moiety of the reagent giving a chromophore
product at basic pH.33 The results in Figure 6 show that there
is a slight decrease in the relative alkylating activity of Mel when
included inside the cavity of CB[7]; however, this effect is minor.
These results agree with the binding mode discussed above from NMR,
docking studies, and MD simulations, where the 2-chloroethylamino
group is located on the outside of the macrocycle, protruding through
one of the portals. Therefore, alkylating activity is roughly maintained.

Figure 6 Alkylating
activity measured as the absorbance at 545 nm for the
NBP assay. Samples corresponded to Mel (200 μM) in the absence
or presence of 1.5 equiv of CB[7].

The main problem that Mel has as a drug is its instability
in aqueous
media due to rapid hydrolysis at neutral pH.24,34,35 Evomela is reported to be stable for 1 h
after reconstitution at room temperature.8,36 To
assess if complexation within CB[7] protected the drug from hydrolysis,
we performed a series of experiments where Mel was incubated at physiological
temperature, and subsequently hydrolysis products were quantified
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based on previous
reports from the literature.24,35,37 In the case of the CB[7] complex, before the analysis, Mel was released
from CB[7] using adamantylamine (ADA) as a competitor due to its high
binding constant (1.2 × 1010 M–1).38 Release from the macrocycle is necessary
for quantification because the extinction coefficient of the complex
is lower than that for free Mel as shown in Figure 1. In these experiments, it is also important
to consider that Mel will hydrolyze somewhat during sample preparation
and during the HPLC run. Therefore, control experiments were performed
for nonincubated samples and the small amounts of hydrolyzed products
detected were subtracted from the incubated samples (see Figures S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information).
Loss of the chlorine atoms leads to their replacement by hydroxyl
groups. Therefore, there are two main hydrolysis products, the monohydroxy
(MOH) and the dihydroxy (DOH) derivatives of Mel,24,39 though other products have been identified by mass spectrometry
(MS).35 The chromatogram in Figure 7 corresponds to a representative
experiment, which shows that Mel incubation produces a single hydrolysis
product with a retention time of 3.6 min. This product is the same
for Mel or the Mel@CB[7] complex and was attributed to the MOH derivative
based on mass spectral analysis (see Figures S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information). Note that the DOH derivative
can be detected by MS but at a relatively low abundance, indicating
that it is a minor product. Comparisons of the integrated areas of
the chromatogram peaks for Mel and MOH yielded a hydrolysis ratio
of 15.7 ± 2.5% for Mel and 11.8 ± 2.7% for Mel@CB[7]. These
two values are the same within error, indicating that CB[7] complexation
does not protect Mel from hydrolysis. It is noteworthy that Mel hydrolysis
is strongly pH-dependent and higher rates of hydrolysis are observed
at neutral or basic pH.24,39 This behavior is consistent
with the proposed mechanism of hydrolysis, involving a nucleophilic
attack of the unprotonated amino group toward one of the chlorine-bearing
carbon atoms.24,39 The results obtained herein are
in line with previous discussions about the binding mode within CB[7];
thus, the exposure of the 2-chloroethylamino group to the solvent
does not change its reactivity toward hydrolysis. This is different
than previously reported slowing of the rate of hydrolysis by Captisol
because in that case the 2-chloroethylamino group is embedded within
the hydrophobic cavity of the macrocycle,30 and this is clearly a limitation for the CB[7] complex. Although
hydrolysis is not prevented, alkylating activity was almost unmodified,
which is still a good antecedent for its therapeutic action.

Mel@CB[7] (blue line) incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 0.1 M HCl.

Finally, the cytotoxicity of Mel and Mel@CB[7] complex was
assessed
in human leukemia cell line (HL-60) as a model for its therapeutic
action. The cytotoxicity assays shown in Figure 8 revealed that there is no significant difference
between the efficacies of Mel and its CB[7] complex in inducing cancer
cell death. Samples in the presence of only CB[7] showed no cytotoxicity,
as reported for several cell lines.13,18 It is important
to emphasize that even when the alkylating activity was slightly decreased
and its hydrolysis was not prevented, the Mel@CB[7] complex performs
as well as the drug by itself, but CB[7] encapsulation offers enhanced
solubility. One can speculate that because the binding of Mel to CB[7]
was observed only at acidic pH and not at pH 7, encapsulation could
help improve drug delivery for an oral formulation of Mel, as the
drug would be released after passing through the stomach.

3 Conclusions
Mel
was effectively encapsulated inside CB[7], which was demonstrated
by changes in the absorption and fluorescence spectra, NMR, docking
studies, and MD simulations. The binding mode corresponded to the
inclusion of the aromatic ring inside the cavity, whereas the α-amino,
α-carboxylic, and 2-chloroethylamino groups protruded through
the portals. Stabilization of the complex was due to a combination
of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and cation–dipole
interactions. The protonation state of Mel was fundamental for the
binding, being observed experimentally only for the fully protonated
form at pH 1. It must be emphasized that Mel hydrochloride is viable
for an injectable formulation (Alkeran). Encapsulation of Mel inside
CB[7] could hold promise for oral intake, where the complex might
be stabilized. The formation of the Mel@CB[7] inclusion complex showed
a slight decrease for the alkylation activity, but the cytotoxicity
was not affected, as shown for the HL-60 cell line. On the other hand,
hydrolysis was not prevented as shown for the encapsulation of Mel
in the β-cyclodextrin derivative (Evomela), and this is proposed
to be due to the binding mode within the macrocycle. In CB[7], the
aromatic ring is inside the cavity of the macrocycle with the 2-chloroethylamino
group placed outside of the cavity, whereas for the β-cyclodextrin
derivative, this group remains inside the cavity, slowing down hydrolysis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Melphalan
(Mel), cucurbit[7]uril
(CB[7]), adamantylamine (ADA), and bis(cyclopentadienyl) cobalt(III)
hexafluorophosphate (Cob+) were obtained from Sigma and
used without further purification. Hydrochloric acid (37%), formic
acid (100%), acetic acid (100%), sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate
salts were obtained from Merck. 4-(4-Nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) was
obtained from Chem-Impex International. Ultrapure water from a Milli-Q
water purifying system was used to prepare all of the solutions (resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ cm).

4.2 Sample Preparation
Stock solutions
of Mel (1 mg mL–1) were prepared by dissolving the
drug in ethanol/HCl solution (99:1). Diluted samples were prepared
in 0.1 M HCl (pH = 1) or 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 (pH meter Hanna
HI2221). Final concentrations were determined by their UV–vis
absorption spectra using a molar extinction coefficient of (4.9 ±
0.2) × 103 M–1 cm–1 at 260 nm in 0.1 M HCl, which was determined in this work.

Stock solutions of CB[7] were prepared in water (≈1 mM) and
titrated against a known concentration of Cob+ by UV–vis
spectroscopy according to the method reported in the literature.40 ADA stock solutions (10 mM) were prepared in
water.

4.3 Absorption and Fluorescence Measurements
The association of Mel (16 μM) to CB[7] (0–50 μM)
was measured by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Absorption
was measured on a HP8453 spectrophotometer using 1 cm pathlength cuvettes.
Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained by exciting the samples
at 260 nm (5 nm bandwidth) using a LS55 PerkinElmer fluorimeter. The
temperature was kept at 25 °C using a waterbath. Binding isotherms
built from the fluorescence data were adjusted using numerical analysis
as reported previously.31,32

4.4 NMR Measurements
Mel (2.5 mg) was
dissolved in 500 μL of DCl/D2O (1:20) with the aid
of sonication in the absence or presence of 1 equiv of CB[7]. The
NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III HD instrument
working at 400 MHz.

4.5 Structure Optimization
and Molecular Docking
Mel in different protonation states
and CB[7] were constructed
using Gaussian 0341 and optimized using
the B3LYP method and 6-31G** base set.5 The partial charges of the compounds were corrected using ESP methodology.
Topology and parameters for all structures were obtained using the
SwissParam server.42

Molecular dockings
of Mel inside CB[7] were carried out using AutoDock 4.0 suite software.43 The grid maps were calculated using the autogrid4
subprogram and were located in the center of CB[7]. The volumes for
the grid maps were 70 × 70 × 70 points with a grid-point
spacing of 0.375 Å. The autotors option was used to define the
rotating bonds in the ligand. The following parameters were employed
in the Lamarckian genetic algorithm dockings: initial population of
1500 random individuals with a population size of 150 individuals;
2.5 × 106 energy evaluations, a maximum number of
27 000 generations, a mutation rate of 0.02, and a cross-over
rate of 0.80. The docked complexes were built picking the lowest docked-energy
binding positions with a relatively high number of conformations.

4.6 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Mel@CB[7]
complexes in different protonation states were solvated by a TIP3
water model and submitted for 10 ns MD simulations using an NPT ensemble.
The calculations were performed using NAMD 2.6 software.44 Periodic boundary conditions were applied to
the systems in the three coordinate directions. A pressure of 1 atm
and a temperature of 298 K were maintained throughout the simulations.

4.7 Alkylating Activity
The alkylation
induced by Mel was measured according to a protocol reported in the
literature.33 Briefly, 5 mL of 200 μM
Mel in 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 5, were mixed with 1.5 mL of a 10%
NBP solution in methanol and the mixture was incubated at 100 °C
for 30 min. The same procedure was adopted for a sample containing
Mel and 1.5 equiv of CB[7]. Control experiments at pH 1 yielded the
same results. After cooling for 15 min, the product was extracted
with 3 mL of chloroform, and then 3 mL of 3 M NaOH was added and the
sample was vortexed thoroughly. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm,
the absorbance of the chloroform layer was measured at 545 nm. The
experiments were performed in triplicate.

4.8 Hydrolysis
The measurement of the
hydrolysis degree of Mel was adapted from previously reported methods.24,35,37 Mel (100 μM) in 0.1 M HCl
was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the absence or presence of
1 equiv of CB[7]. After incubation, ADA (200 μM) was added to
the samples containing CB[7] to release Mel from the macrocycle. Hydrolysis
products were measured on an Hitachi Elite LaChrom HPLC system using
an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in
water (32:68), RP-18 endcapped column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm2, Merck), 1 mL min–1 flow, and 260 nm for
the detection wavelength (L-2455 diode array detector). Control experiments
with nonincubated samples were performed to take into account the
hydrolysis of Mel during the analysis (preparation and HPLC column
run), and the small amounts of hydrolyzed products detected were subtracted
from the incubated samples.

4.9 Cytotoxicity Assay
HL-60 cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded in
96-well plates at a density 3 × 105 cells/well. Mel
or Mel@CB[7] were added at a final concentration of 200 μM and
incubated for 24 h. After the treatment, cell viability was determined
by the MTT assay (10% v/v of 5 mg mL–1 MTT solution
was added to each well and incubated for 2 h). Then, the formazan
crystals formed by the reaction between metabolically active cells
and MTT were dissolved by adding a solution of 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate in 0.01 M HCl into each well. The plate was left overnight
in an incubator to finally read its absorbance at 570 nm using a Biotek
Synergy HT microplate reader.
