Understanding
the relation between the chemical bonding and the
electron-transfer (ET) reaction of surface-confined hemin (a five-coordinated
Fe-porphyrin-with-chlorine complex) is a special interest in the biomimicking
studies of heme proteins. Owing to the difficulty in ET function,
scanty electrochemical reports of hemin in aqueous solution were reported.
It has been noticed that in most of the reported procedures, the sixth
axial coordination position of the hemin complex has been unknowingly
turned by attaching with water molecules (potential cycling in alkaline
conditions or heating), solvents such as ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide,
and nitrogen-donating compounds that have helped for the heme ET reaction.
In this work, a systematic effort has been taken to find out the contribution
of hemin and its axial bond coordination with π–π
interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic binding systems toward
the ET reaction. Various graphitic carbons such as graphitized mesoporous
carbon (GMC), mesoporous carbon-hydrophilic and hydrophobic units,
graphite nanopowder, graphene oxide, single-walled carbon, multiwalled
carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNT
(as a source for π–π interaction, hydrogen bonding,
and hydrophobic environment) along with the amino functional group
of chitosan (Chit; as an axial site coordinating system) have been
tested by modifying them as a hemin hybrid on a glassy carbon electrode
(GCE). In addition, a gold nanoparticle (Aunano) system
was combined with the above matrix as a molecular wiring agent, and
its role was examined. A highly stable and well-defined redox peak
at an apparent formal potential (Eo′) of −320 mV versus Ag/AgCl with the highest surface excess
of 120 × 10–10 mol cm–2 was
noticed with the GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
hybrid system, wherein all interactive features have been utilized.
Omitting any of the individual interactions resulted in either decreased
(with Aunano) or nil current response. As applications,
efficient bio-electrocatalytic reduction and sensing of dissolved
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide have been demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Hemin,
a five-coordinated Fe-porphyrin-with-chlorine complex (Scheme 1), is a derived active
site of the heme-containing proteins and enzymes such as hemoglobin
(Hb), cytochrome C, horseradish peroxidase, and catalase.1 It is produced endogenously in the human body
during the turnover of red blood cells (RBCs).2 Indeed, it forms inappropriately as a result of vascular (vessels
that carry blood) injury or hemolysis (rupture or destruction of RBCs)
in the physiological system.3 It has been
revealed that the endogenously formed hemin helps in intracellular
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide,
singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide.4 At the same time, this hemin has the capacity to interact
with the peroxide and oxygen molecules and facilitates their bio-electrocatalytic
reduction to water by mediated electron-transfer (ET) reaction mechanism
(at specific operating potentials).5 Note
that meticulous ROS production in human cells assists in energy production6 and apoptosis7 and
supports to combat pathogens. Indeed, abandoned ROS leads to permanent
damage of the cell organelles and tissues.8 Biomimicking the ET function of the hemin and probing the mysteries
of its biological function are a continued research interest. In this
regard, fixing hemin as a surface-confined species similar to the
natural system is an important step. Unfortunately, there is no clear
and systematic information about ET of surface-confined hemin complex
covering π–π and hydrogen bonding and axial ligand
coordination, in the literature. The electro-inactive character of
hemin on solid electrodes is a prime reason for the limitation. Herein,
we report a meticulously designed hemin-confined carbon nanomaterial
(graphitic base)/chitosan (Chit) chemically modified electrode, designated
as glassy carbon electrode (GCE)/carbon@hemin–Chit, for an
efficient ET and mediated reduction of dissolved oxygen and hydrogen
peroxide in a physiological system.

Structures of Various Chemically Modified
Electrodes and (E–I) Preparation of GCE/Aunano–GMC@Hemin–Chit
via Various Intermediate Modified Electrodes
With the aim of biomimetic studies, since 1928, there
has been
significant interest on the ET feature of hemin (homogenous condition)
in organic and semiaqueous mediums.9−12 In 1967, Bednarski and Jordan
first reported the adsorption and ET study of hemin on the dropping
Hg electrode in 0.1 M KOH solution and stated that hemin forms a soluble
dimer, which undergoes a two-electron reversible reduction to yield
a ferroheme monomer (wherein two water molecules are attached on the
two axial positions).12 Following this,
there were several studies on hemin complex with Hg systems.13,14 In 1990, Bianco et al. reported adsorption of hemin on a pyrolytic
graphite electrode (PGE) and showed an ET reaction at Eo′ ≈ −0.55 V versus Ag/AgCl with
a surface excess of Γhemin = 11 × 10–10 mol cm–2 in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (PBS).15 In their preparation procedure, the PGE was
simply exposed to hemin solution containing 30% ethanol/borate buffer
of pH 11. It has been claimed that the π–π interaction
between the graphitic sites and hemin is responsible for the adsorption
and ET feature. In a similar fashion, hemin was adsorbed on a multiwalled
carbon nanotube (MWCNT) via π–π interaction and
showed Eo′ = −0.34 V versus
Ag/AgCl and Γhemin = 27 × 10–10 mol cm–2.16 Later on,
a covalently immobilized hemin on an amino-functionalized MWCNT-modified
electrode via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)
(Eo′ ≈ −0.5 V vs
Ag/AgCl in pH 1 buffer) was reported.17 Recently, hemin-immobilized graphene oxide (GO)- (a hemin–NaOH
solution heated at 70 °C was used; Eo′ = −0.15 V vs Ag/AgCl; Γhemin ≈ 1
× 10–10 mol cm–2)18 and gold nanoparticle–GO (a mixture of
ethanolic solution of hemin–GO–Aunano was
used; Eo′ = −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl,
Γhemin ≈ 2 × 10–10 mol
cm–2)-19 based chemically
modified electrodes were reported in the literature. All of those
studies emphasize the π–π interaction for the ET
process. Meanwhile, there were few reports on hemin surface-confined
gold self-assembled monolayer electrodes utilizing nitrogen-containing
biomolecules such as histidine and guanine quadruplex (G4) complexes
with Eo′ = −0.22 to −0.35
V versus Ag/AgCl and Γhemin = 0.0016–2.2 ×
10–10 mol cm–2. These above reports
highlight the importance of the planar orientation and axial ligand
interactions for the ET activity.20,21 In this report,
π–π interaction, axial ligand coordination, and
multihydrogen bonding were collectively tuned for the enhanced ET
reaction of the hemin on a carbon nanomaterial/Chit-modified electrode
system.

Importance of the axial ligand coordination in the ET
of hemin
was first reported by Richard et al. by studying a series of 29 pentacoordinate
hemin derivatives using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in a
noncoordinating solvent (CH2Cl2).22 A linear correlation between the Eo′ values of the hemin derivatives and pKa of the axial ligands had been shown. Further,
it was stated that nitrogen- and sulfur-containing solvents such as
dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide are capable of coordinating
with hemin (in the sixth position) and assisting the ET feature.22 Surprisingly, in many of the previous studies
with hemin-surface confined systems, the axial position of the hemin
has been unknowingly turned.18,19,21 For instance, water molecules attachment in the axial positions
by electrochemical treatment in alkaline solution and heating,18 and using organic solvent or compounds like
ethanol and EDC as a coordinating ligand in the preparation procedure.18,19,21 In this report, to understand
the role of the sixth vacant axial position of the hemin site in association
with other chemical interactions, a systematic effort has been taken
by providing a control environment using Chit, graphitic carbon nanomaterials,
especially graphitized mesoporous carbon (GMC), and gold nanoparticles
to confinement of the hemin complex. The GMC provides not only a graphitic
environment for π–π interaction but also a mesoporous
space (∼50 nm)23,24 and oxygen functional groups
for the entrapment and hydrogen bonding. Similarly, the amino functional
group of the Chit helps for the sixth vacant axial position coordination,
and gold nanoparticles support as an internal ET linker (wiring).
Previously, it has been shown that Chit, a linear polysaccharide-based
biopolymer obtained from shrimp cells,23 is effective for complexation with the iron site25−27 and gold nanoparticles
as a linker for the electrical wiring of biomolecules.28−30 Several control experiments were carried out utilizing different
carbon nanomaterials such as mesoporous carbon (CM)-hydrophobic unit,
CM-hydrophilic unit, GO, graphite nanoparticles (GNPs), single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNT), MWCNT, and carboxylic group-functionalized
MWCNT (f-MWCNT) to find the contribution of the π–π
and oxygen functional group influences on the ET feature of the hemin.
In addition, owing to its biological relevance,4−8 dissolved oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reduction
reactions mediated by the surface-confined hemin in a physiological
system have been studied as model systems.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 CV Study of GCE/Aunano–Carbon@Hemin–Chit
Initial experiments
were carried out using GMC as a standard system.
At first, the hemin complex is adsorbed on a bare GCE surface and
subjected to CV study in N2-purged pH 7 PBS. As can be
seen in Figure 1A,
curve a, a featureless voltammetric response was noticed. This observation
is the same when the hemin is modified on GCE/GMC as GCE/GMC@hemin
(Figure 1A, curve b)
(Scheme 1A–C).
Note that, even after providing a graphitic environment by GMC, which
can support π–π interaction, there is no specific
redox signal for hemin. This is the reason why, in previous reports,
hemin surface-confined graphene and GO/gold nanoparticle systems failed
to show any marked characteristic redox peak at an apparent electrode
potential of Eo′ = −0.320
V versus Ag/AgCl in neutral pH solution,32,33 affirming that graphitic interaction alone could not be a prime
factor for the ET reaction. Interestingly, when a dilute solution
of Chit polymer which contains an amino functional group is coated
on GCE/GMC@hemin, as GCE/GMC@hemin–Chit, a well-defined redox
peak at Eo′ = −380 ±
5 mV versus Ag/AgCl with a surface coverage (Γhemin) = 62 × 10–10 mol cm–2 appeared
because of the ET of the surface-confined hemin (Figure 1A, curve c). Meanwhile, a 1%
Nafion (Nf) polymer, a characteristic cationic exchange polymer without
any amino functional group, is casted on GCE/GMC@hemin, as GCE/GMC@hemin–Nf,
and tested (Supporting Information Figure
S1). In addition, hemin adsorbed on the Chit-modified electrode, that
is, GCE/Chit@hemin, was also tested (data not included). There is
no formation of the redox peak in the previous cases. These observations
highlight the important role of the amino functional group along with
the graphitic environment for the redox tuning of the hemin. In the
literature, the amino group in Chit has been referred to as a good
coordinating site. Our group utilized Chit for the complexation with
the iron site buried in the pristine MWCNT.26 Similarly, Chit–iron(III)-modified smectites,34 a [Fe(CN)5(NH3)]3– complex-incorporated Chit hybrid film,35 and an Fe(III)–Chit complex36 have
been reported in the literature utilizing complexation of the amino
functional group with the iron site. In this work, it is expected
that the amino functional group of Chit is bounded on the sixth vacant
position of the hemin (axial bond) and helped the ET process.

With an aim to improve the performance
and literature reports based
on molecular wiring systems,16,29,30,37−39 Aunano particles were chosen as a wiring agent and incorporated in the
optimal electrode as a GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
configuration. The preparation procedure was optimized as casting
a dilute solution of Au3+ ion on the GCE as the first step
followed by other modification procedures. During the electrochemical
potential cycling experiment, the Au3+ ion was in situ
reduced as Aunano particles and molecularly wired in the
matrix (Scheme 1H,I).31Figure 1A (curve d) shows a typical CV response of GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit, showing the redox peak at Eo′ = −320 ± 2 mV versus Ag/AgCl
with a 2-fold enhancement in the Γhemin value (120
× 10–10 mol cm–2). Further, Eo′ noticed here is about 70 mV positive
than the value obtained without the Aunano particle-modified
electrode (−390 mV), supporting the molecular wiring within
the matrix. The Eo′ value (−320
mV) is matching with previous reports on hemin-modified electrodes,
for example, hemin-MWCNT (Eo′ =
−0.34 V vs Ag/AgCl),16 Aunano–GO–hemin (Eo′ =
−0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl),19 and hemin-self-assembled
gold monolayers via histidine and guanine quadruplex (G4) complexes
(Eo′ = −0.22 to −0.3
V vs Ag/AgCl).20,21 The calculated peak-to-peak separation
value (ΔEp) is 40 mV at v = 10 mV s–1, indicating a fast ET process.
It is noteworthy that the Γhemin value noticed in
this work is the highest compared to the previous literature reports
on the hemin-surface-confined system such as PGE@hemin (11 ×
10–10 mol cm–2),15 MWCNT@hemin (27 × 10–10 mol cm–2),16 and N-doped GO@hemin
(13 × 10–10 mol cm–2).39 In continuation, Nf polymer-coated GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin (GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Nf)
was also examined for the redox activity (data not enclosed) (Scheme 1D). However, nil
redox response was noticed, confirming the specificity of Chit for
the axial coordination ET process. On the basis of the results, it
has been proposed that π–π interaction, axial coordination,
hydrogen bonding (oxygen and hydrogen functional groups between hemin,
GMC, and Chit), and internal linking (wiring) factors have been collectively
involved in the effective ET process in this work.

From the
CV study of the effect of scan rate (v), it is confirmed
that ET of GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
is surface-confined in nature (anodic and cathodic peak currents ipa and ipc vs v are linear starting from the origin) (Figure 2A,B). The ratio of the cathodic
and anodic peak currents, ipc/ipa, is found to be nearly unity, obeying the
reversible nature of the ET process. The heterogeneous rate constant ks was calculated from the Laviron’s model
at condition ΔEp < 200 mV using
the equation ks = mnFv/RT, where m is a dimensional-less
parameter relating to ΔEp and transfer
coefficient value (α), n is the number of ET
(n = 1), v is the scan rate, and
other symbols have their own significance.40 Priorly, the values Epc – Ef/Epa – Ef = 1 and ΔEp = 99 mV at v = 100 mV s–1 (Figure 2C) were applied in
the Laviron’s working plots,40 and
the α value was calculated as 0.5. On the basis of the parameters,
the ks value at v = 100
mV s–1 is then calculated as 1.3 s–1. This value is comparable with the values reported for Hb-based
surface-confined systems such as Hb–MWCNT–Nf (1.25 s–1), Hb–f-CNT–CTAB surfactant–Nf
(1.25 s–1), Hb–ionic liquid–MWCNT–CPE
(0.84 s–1), and Hb–IL–MWCNT–carbon
paste electrode (0.99 s–1).41−43 Further, the
redox peak is pH-dependent in nature (Figure 2D). The plot of Epa versus pH is linear with a slope of −36 mV pH–1, indicating the non-Nernstian behavior (expected slope = −58
mV pH–1).26 Previously,
a similar kind of observation was made with several Hb-modified electrodes:
Hb-polymer-grafted MWCNT (−42 mV pH–1)44 and Hb–CNT–HA (−38 mV pH–1) systems.45 Partial protonation
of ligands is the likely reason for this observation.46 At this stage, it is difficult to predict the exact molecular
orientation of the hemin in this new system. Further, because the
modified electrode is complex in nature and the concentration of the
immobilized species is at the nanogram level, it is not convenient
to use conventional characterization techniques such as nuclear magnetic
resonance and mass spectroscopy to identify the active site. On the
other hand, from the control experiments and physicochemical characterization
studies, the possible structure and orientation of the surface-confined
hemin system can be predicted.

at scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

The concept of immobilizing hemin is extended to other carbon
nanomaterials
as well. Figure 1B–H
shows the typical CV responses of the surface-confined hemin systems
on various carbons such as CM-hydrophilic unit, CM-hydrophobic unit,
GNPs, SWCNT, MWCNT, f-MWCNT, and GO prepared similar to the GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit case. With respect to the
Γhemin value, the carbon materials were sequenced
as follows (ascending order): GO (no graphitic structure; no redox
peak response) ≅ CM-hydrophilic unit (no graphitic structure;
no redox peak response) < GNPs (8 × 10–10 mol cm–2) < f-MWCNT (15 × 10–10 mol cm–2) < CM-hydrophobic unit (61 ×
10–10 mol cm–2) < SWCNT (90
× 10–10 mol cm–2) < MWCNT
(101 × 10–10 mol cm–2) <
GMC (120 × 10–10 mol cm–2). Following important conclusions can be derived from the observations:
(i) The graphitic structure is necessary. (ii) Comparing hydrophilic
and hydrophobic structures, hydrophobic units have positive assistance
for ET process. (iii) Oxygen functional groups such as carboxylic
and ether in f-MWCNT and GO have a negative effect with the functional
group of hemin. Possibly, there may be electrostatic repulsions between
the oxygen functional groups (hemin-COOH, pKa ≈ 3.8)22 and hence avoid
the communication. Indeed, a fraction of the carbon’s oxygen
functional groups helped for the hydrogen bond formation. (iv) The
MWCNT structure is better than the single-walled structure, which
may be due to the highly porous nature. (v) The graphitic structure
along with the porous site provided by the GMC is the best option
for the stable entrapment of the hemin system. Overall, it is obvious
that tuning of π–π interaction, hydrophobic interaction,
hydrogen bonding, and axial ligand coordination is necessary for the
effective ET reaction. Partial or incomplete tuning of the interactions
may result in either poor or nil ET process.17,18,28,47−49 Because of the well-defined redox peak response, highest Γhemin, and low material cost, GMC has been chosen as a model
system in this work.

In order to find out the interaction of
Aunano on the
hemin functional group, control experiments were carried out with
other forms of hemin derivative, hematin, modified electrodes, that
is, GCE/Aunano–GMC@hematin–Chit and GCE/GMC@hematin–Chit
(without Aunano). The hematin electrodes were prepared
similar to GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit and
tested. Figure 3 (curves
a and b) shows the typical CV responses of GCE/Aunano–GMC@hematin–Chit
(curve b) and GCE/GMC@hematin–Chit (curve a) in N2-purged pH 7 PBS at v = 50 mV s–1. Unlike the hemin case with a 50% increment in the Γhemin value (Figure 1A,
curve c), there is no significant effect of Aunano on the
redox feature of the hematin (Figure 3, curves a and b). Both Aunano-modified
and unmodified hematin electrodes showed almost similar redox peaks
signals (Figure 3).
Note that, both hemin and hematin have the same molecular structure
and varies only in the fifth axial ligands, where in, chloride (Cl)
with hemin and hydroxide (OH) with hematin (Scheme 1). From these results, it can be revealed
that Aunano has a positive interaction with the chloride
ligand of hemin (likely chemisorption) as {Fe–Cl···Aunano} (molecular wiring) in turn for the enhanced communication.

reaction characteristics.

2.2 Physicochemical Characterizations
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
and GMC@Chit systems are shown in Figure 4. There is no marked change in the structural
feature, except for black shades on the graphitic structure and fine
dots of ∼20–40 nm in size with Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit.
These preliminary observations may support π–π
interaction between the hemin and the graphitic structure of GMC and
the presence of some nanoparticles in the matrix. Extended experiment
with TEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) showed
signals corresponding to Cu (because of the copper grid), Au, and
Fe atoms (Supporting Information Figure
S2). This observation confirms the existence of hemin-Fe and Au systems
on the modified electrode. Supporting Information Figure S3 shows comparative Raman spectroscopic responses of Au/GMC@hemin–Chit
and unmodified GMC displaying specific D and G bands corresponding
to the graphitic (hexagonal sp2 carbons) and disordered
structure (sp3 carbons), respectively.46 The calculated intensity ratio between D and G bands, ID/IG, for Au/GMC@hemin–Chit
(0.214) is less than that for the unmodified GMC (0.2707). These data
indicate an improvement in the graphitic structure of GMC by the hemin
surface confinement through π–π interaction. Although
the porphyrin rings have π bonds, because of the improper orientation,
they may not be completely aligned on the six-membered π structure
of the GMC-graphitic units. On the other hand, the alkene tail in
hemin is expected to have positive π–π interaction
with the graphitic structure (Scheme 1). UV–vis spectroscopic characterization was
also used for the structural identification in this work. For that,
respective GCE-modified electrode was sonicated with 500 μL
of PBS and filtered with a microsyringe. Figure 5A shows a typical UV–vis response
of Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit, hemin, and Au3+ solution (precursor). Specific absorption signals at λmax ∼405 and 534 nm were noticed. Compared with the
control hemin and Au3+ solution and the data from the literature
related to hemin–GO hybrid (λmax = 413 nm)28 and Aunano (λmax = 520–535 nm; 20–70 nm-sized particles),50 the UV–vis signals can be identified
as hemin (hybrid) and Aunano particles, respectively. Figure 5B shows comparative
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)/KBr responses of various modified
electrodes prepared by pealing the layer of the modified electrode
and combined with KBr. The Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
system showed specific IR signals at 3550 (νOH), 2980 (νC=C),
2356 (νC–H), 1713 (νC=O), 1237–1343
(νC–NH–C and Aunano), 886 (νC5-ring),
and 717 (ν–C=CH) cm–1 for various
characteristic functional groups along with a specific intense signal
at 1044 cm–1 due to the Fe–N stretching,
selectively confirming amino group complexation with the axial position
of the hemin-Fe site.51 These characteristic
IR signals (except the Fe–N stretching) are found to be slightly
shifted with respect to the signals of the corresponding control samples:
GMC (3450, 2116, 1736, and 1134 cm–1), hemin (2994,
1705, 1200–1390, 928, and 708 cm–1), and
Chit (3315 and 1639 cm–1).31,52,53 The information supports the existence of
various functional group interactions such as π–π,
hydrophilic, and hydrogen bonding within the new chemically modified
electrode.

2.3 Bio-Electrocatalytic
Reduction of Dissolved Oxygen and Hydrogen
Peroxide
Figure 6A shows the CV response of GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
with (10 ppm) and without oxygen gas saturation in pH 7 PBS at v = 10 mV s–1. A N2 gas-purged
pH 7 PBS was used as an electrolyte. A well-defined oxygen reduction
signal at an onset potential, 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl with peak current
maximums at 0 and −0.38 V versus Ag/AgCl, where the hemin redox
peak exists, was noticed. A control experiment with a hemin unmodified
electrode, GCE/Aunano–GMC–Chit showed a reduction
signal about 300 mV higher negative potential and about twice lesser
in the peak current value than that of the optimal electrode. This
observation denotes the hemin redox-mediated reduction of the dissolved
oxygen. A pre-reduction peak at about 0 V versus Ag/AgCl noticed with
the optimal working electrode is due to immobilization of the hemin
at energetically different surfaces such as pores and valleys/asperities
of the GMC and its interaction with analytes.43 Presumably, hemin trapped at the pores of the GMC, which provide
significant π–π and hydrogen bonding, is responsible
for the low-potential peak observation in this work. Figure 6B shows the effect of dissolved
oxygen concentration on the mediated oxygen reduction current signals.
The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured discreetly by a DO
meter (the inset of Figure 6B). A systematic increment in the peak current against the
increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration was noticed. The plot
of peak current versus dissolved oxygen concentration was linear in
a range of 0–8 ppm with a current sensitivity value of 0.794
μA ppm–1 (Figure 6C). This result highlights the potential
use of the new system for dissolved oxygen sensor development.

In addition, electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide
was
also demonstrated with this new hemin-modified electrode system, as
in Figure 6D. The H2O2 reduction signal was noticed at an onset potential
of −0.38 V versus Ag/AgCl with peak maximums at −0.05
and −0.4 V, similar to the case of the oxygen reduction reaction,
due to the mediated reduction by the surface-confined hemin sites.
The plot of the reduction peak current signal  versus
concentration of H2O2 is linear in a window
5 μM–1 mM with a current sensitivity value of 0.044 μA
μM–1. With an aim to extend to electroanalytical
assays, amperometric i–t analysis
of H2O2 at an applied potential of 0 V versus
Ag/AgCl in N2-purged pH 7 PBS was also performed by spiking
25 μM H2O2 in a stirred electrolyte solution
(Supporting Information Figure S4A). A
regular increase in the current signals against the H2O2 spikes was noticed. The calibration plot of baseline-corrected
current signals versus [H2O2] was linear in
the range 0–250 μM with a relative standard deviation
of 3.1% (S/N = 3) (Figure S4B). The calculated
detection limit was 6.8 μM. The analytical results are comparable
with the previous literature reports on Hb-based chemically modified
electrodes, wherein the detection limit value is in a range of 4–45
μM.46,54,55 In addition,
the effect of interferences from various biochemicals such as nitrite
(NO2–), nitrate (NO3–), glucose (Glu), uric acid (UA), ascorbic acid (AA), xanthine (Xan),
hypoxanthine (hyp), cysteine (CysH), and dopamine (DP) on the detection
of 50 μM H2O2 at an applied potential
of 0 V was analyzed (Supporting Information Figure S4C). There is no significant alteration in the reduction
current signals upon spiking the aforementioned interfering biochemicals.
This observation indicates the selective H2O2 electrochemical interaction and reduction similar to the heme-based
protein/enzymatic systems. GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
is found to be stable at room temperature for 30 days and beyond (Supporting Information Figure S5), unlike the
enzymatic systems, which have poor stability.

3 Conclusions
Highly redox active hemin-complex surface-confined
carbon nanomaterial/Chit/Aunano chemically modified electrodes
have been prepared by a
simple drop-casting technique within 18 ± 2 min. Cyclic voltammetric
investigation of the modified electrode showed a well-defined redox
peak at Eo′ = −320 ±
2 mV versus Ag/AgCl with peak-to-peak separation and surface excess
values of 40 mV (10 mV s–1) and 120 × 10–10 mol cm–2, respectively, in N2 gas-purged pH 7 PBS because of the facile ET behavior of
the iron site in the hemin. Control experiments with the absence of
Chit and graphitic carbon nanomaterial resulted in nil redox peak
response. The new hemin-modified electrode was subjected to several
physicochemical characterization studies using TEM, EDXS, Raman spectroscopy,
UV–vis, and FTIR. The collective results revealed that the
axial coordination bonding of amino functional groups of the Chit
with sixth vacant site of the hemin is a key step for the ET process
of the hemin-surface-confined carbon nanomaterial systems. Incorporating
gold nanoparticles in the matrix improved the ET function through
molecular wirings. As an electrochemical application, electrocatalytic
reductions of dissolved oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in N2-purged pH 7 PBS have been demonstrated. The new modified electrode
showed about 300 mV reduction in the overpotential and two times increment
in the reduction peak current signals over the respective unmodified
electrode, GCE/Aunano–GMC–Chit. Extension
of the new system toward sensor applications of dissolved oxygen and
H2O2 without interference from common biochemicals
was also demonstrated. Unlike the enzymatic systems, the hemin surface-confined
carbon nanomaterial system showed redox stability over 30 days at
room temperature.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Lyophilized hemin from Bovine
(purity > 90%), GMC (purity > 99.95%, <50 nm pore size),
GO–ethanol dispersed stock solution (GO, 5 mg mL–1, ∼80% carbon basis, flake size—0.5–2.0 μm,
thickness—0.6–1.2 nm, purity—99%), mesoporous
carbon-hydrophilic core (CM, 99.95% pure; particle size 5–50
μm) and mesoporous carbon-hydrophobic core (99.95% pure; particle
size 5–50 μm), carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNT (f-MWCNT;
∼90% pure, size 7–15 nm × 0.5–10 mm), SWCNT
(∼70% pure on carbon basis, 0.7–1.1 nm diameter), and
Chit were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Standard gold solution
(1000 mg L–1) was purchased from SISCO Research
Laboratories, India. Other basic chemicals of analytical grade were
used without any purification. Nitrogen-purged (15 min) PBS (N2 PBS) of ionic strength 0.1 M, pH 7 was used as a supporting
electrolyte. Screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) were purchased
from Zensor R&D, Taiwan.

4.2 Apparatus
Electrochemical
experiments were carried
out using a portable Biologic (USA) instrument with a three-electrode
system comprising hemin chemically modified GCE (GCE/GMC@hemin–Chit)
as a working electrode (0.0707 cm2), platinum as a counter
electrode, and Ag/AgCl with 3M KCl as a reference electrode with a
10 mL working volume of N2-purged pH 7 PBS. Raman spectroscopy
analyses were carried out using AZILTRON, PRO 532, (USA) with a 532
nm laser excitation source. UV–vis analysis was done by using
a UV–vis NIR spectrophotometer, JASCO V-670, Japan. FTIR analysis
was done with a JASCO 4100 spectrophotometer by KBr method. A portable
dissolved oxygen meter (HI9142) from Hanna Instruments, USA, was used
to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration.

4.3 Fabrication
of a Hemin Chemically Modified Electrode
First, the GCE (3
mm in diameter) was subjected to a series of chemical,
mechanical, and electrochemical cleaning procedures, as reported in
the literature.26 For the preparation of
GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit, the clean surface
of GCE was first casted with Au3+ solution (5μL;
1000 ppm), followed by drying at room temperature for 2
± 1 min. Then, 5 μL of GMC or other carbon nanomaterial–ethanol
suspension (2 mg mL–1) was casted and air-dried
(2 ± 1 min). Following this, 5 μL of hemin–NaOH
(0.1 M) solution (2 mg mL–1) was dropped on the
surface of the above modified electrode (GCE/Aunano–GMC)
and left to dry in an incubator (40 ± 2 °C) for 5 ±
1 min. As a last step, 5 μL of 0.5% Chit–acetic acid
solution was overlayer-coated and air-dried for 2 ± 1 min. In
total, within 18 ± 2 min, the modified electrode can be prepared.
The modified electrode was potential-cycled in pH 7 PBS at a window
−0.8 to 0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl for 20 scans at v = 50 mV s–1 (Scheme 1). During this process, the Au3+ ions were in situ reduced as Au nanoparticles and stabilized by
the amino functional group of Chit in the modified electrodes (Scheme 1H,I).31

For Raman spectroscopic characterization,
SPCE-coated GMC and Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit
were used. UV–vis spectroscopy measurements were carried out
by stripping out the hemin site from the GCE-modified electrode by
sonicating the electrode with 500 μL of pH 7 PBS followed by
microfiltration. To perform a typical FTIR characterization, respective
GCE-modified electrodes were peeled off with a doctor’s syringe
needle (1 mm × 4 cm), mixed with KBr as a pellet, and subjected
to the analysis. Electrocatalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen and
H2O2 was carried out by exposing GCE/Aunano–GMC@hemin–Chit to saturated DO (10 ppm,
measured by a standard DO meter) taken in N2-purged pH
7 PBS and 500 μM H2O2.
