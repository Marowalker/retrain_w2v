Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) has gained high attention as a useful biomarker in the imaging
evaluation of prostate cancer with positron emission tomography (PET)
during recent years. [68Ga]-labeled Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC
([68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC) is a novel PSMA inhibitor radiotracer
which has demonstrated its suitability in detecting prostate cancer.
Preparation conditions may influence the quality and in vivo behavior
of this tracer, and no standard procedure for the quality control
(QC) is available. The aim of this study was to develop a new rapid
and simple high-pressure liquid chromatography method of analysis
for the routine QCs of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC to guarantee
the high quality of the radiopharmaceutical product before release. Methods: A stepwise approach was used based on the quality
by design concept of the International Conference of Harmonisation
Q2 (R1) and Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development) guidelines in accordance
with the regulations and requirements of European Association of Nuclear
Medicine, Society of Nuclear Medicine, International Atomic Energy
Agency, World Health Organization, and Italian Association of Nuclear
Medicine and Molecular Imaging. The developed analytical test method
was validated because a specific monograph in the pharmacopoeia is
not available for [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC. Results: The purity and quality of the radiopharmaceutical obtained according
to the proposed method resulted high enough to safely administrate
it to patients. An excellent linearity was found between 0.8 and 5
μg/mL, with a detection limit of 0.2 μg/mL. Assay imprecision
(% CV) was <2%. Conclusions: The developed method
to assess the radiochemical and chemical purity of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
is rapid, accurate, and reproducible, allowing routinely the use of
this PET tracer as a diagnostic tool for imaging prostate cancer and
also assuring patient safety.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa)
is now recognized as one of the most important
medical problems facing the male population,1 and it is currently the second most common cause of cancer death
in men.2 Until recently, choline-based
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) represented
the state-of-the-art radionuclide imaging technique for treatment
selection. However, there have been numerous studies reporting a low
sensitivity and specificity,3,4 especially in patients
with prostate-specific antigen values below 3 ng/mL with a detection
rate reported to be only 40–60%.5−7

Prostate-specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell surface protein
with high expression in prostate carcinoma cells and a promising new
target for specific imaging of PCa.8−11 Recently, an innovative 68Ga-labeled ligand has been designed to target membrane PSMA
in vivo using PET/CT.12

There are
several biological characteristics making the prostate-urea-based
inhibitors of the PSMA an outstanding target for nuclear medicine.
PSMA is a type II transmembrane protein with glutamate–carboxypeptidase
activity and a known substrate, an ideal target for developing small-molecule
radiopharmaceuticals which typically shows fast blood clearance and
low background activity.11

The acyclic
Ga(III) chelator N,N′-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]
ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic
acid (HBED-CC) is
introduced into the radiotracer as a lipophilic moiety, allowing a
favorable interaction with the hydrophobic pocket of the PSMA receptor.

The HBED-CC chelator enables efficient radiolabeling of Ga-68 even
at ambient temperature.13

However,
in contrast to other clinically well-established radiometal
chelators, HBED-CC forms three NMR-distinguishable diastereomers (RR,
RS, and SS configurations at the amine nitrogens) during gallium complexation,
where presumably the RR configuration is thermodynamically favored.
Besides the influence of the temperature, the formation of the diastereomers
was reported to be pH- and concentration-dependent as well.13,14

The two diastereomers have the same biological activity (evaluation
of cell binding and internalization in human prostatic adenocarcinoma
cell line) and the same radiochemical stability after the labeling
procedure.

In a standard labeling protocol, [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
is incubated at a pH of ∼4 and heated at 95 °C. The thermodynamically
favored diastereomer is formed; however, a small fraction of one of
the other two diastereomers is still present in the labeling reaction
without influencing the cell-binding properties of the final formulation
of the PSMA-targeted radioligand [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC prepared
for the patient.13,14

Therefore, there is a need
for a quality control (QC) test capable
of separating each impurity from [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC and
to accomplish it over a short duration.

Taking into account
the above pieces of information and the complexity
of radioactive gallium chemistry, the QC process is vital to ensure
the safety and effectiveness of the radiolabeling procedure.

Finally, the Italian and European Pharmacopoeia do not provide
any guidelines on the QC of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC, and the
literature reports only about the synthesis of the tracer but not
about the QC method.13

In recent
years, radiopharmaceuticals with such complex characteristics
gain clinical interest according to the increasing need of personalized
management of the diseases requiring detection of the specific biological
targets.

The continuing development of new tools for molecular
imaging is
not accompanied by a coherent effort in development, standardization,
and validation of QC methods to guarantee high-quality radiopharmaceutical
production, especially in the routine clinical setting.

More
strong work is necessary when labeling procedures are complex
and form different stereoisomers of the same molecule during isotope
complexation to assess the diagnostic efficacy and safety of the final
product.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a
rapid and simple
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method of analysis for
the routine QCs of a [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC PET tracer. More
specifically, our aim was to prepare and characterize reference materials,
as well as to determine a practical QC test for the routine use of
[68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC samples.

2 Results
and Discussion
Under the chromatographic conditions described,
Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC
(PSMA-11), natGa-labeled reference Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-[Ga(HBED-CC)]
(DKFZ-GaPSMA-11), and the internal standard peaks were well-resolved.

In Figure 1, typical
chromatograms of the blank eluent are illustrated in comparison with
spiked samples analyzed for the analytical HPLC method validation.
The average retention times of the first and second diastereoisomers
of PSMA-11 were 6.9 and 7.1 min, respectively, similar to those for
the two diastereoisomers of DKFZ-GaPSMA-11.

Figure 1 HPLC traces of the blank
sample (a), PSMA (b), and Ga-PSMA (c).
The peaks (b,c) correspond to (1), the thermodynamically more stable,
and (2), the thermodynamically less stable diastereomer, respectively.

The calibration curve for the
determination of PSMA-11 and DKFZ-GaPSMA-11
was linear over the range 5–0.8 μg/mL. The linearity
of this method was statistically confirmed for each calibration curve
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Calibration
curve obtained with the average values of peak areas
of five different concentrations (5, 4, 3.125, 1.25, and 0.8 μg/mL)
of PSMA (a) and Ga-PSMA (b).

The correlation coefficient (r2) for
calibration curves was equal to 0.999, which is in accordance with
the acceptance criteria (Table 2).

The relative standard deviation (RSD) value of the
slope was equal
to 0.21%. For each point of the calibration standard, the concentrations
of PSMA-11 and GaPSMA-11 were recalculated from the equation of the
linear regression curve and the average bias % values were found to
be 97.90 and 97.98%, respectively.

The limit of quantitation
(LOQ) for PSMA-11 and DKFZ-GaPSMA-11
was 0.8 μg/mL.

As shown in Table 1, the coefficient of variation (CV %) was
less than 2%.

Under the same gradient chromatographic conditions
described above,
[68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC and the internal standard peaks were
well-resolved.

Figure 3 shows a
typical chromatogram of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC analyzed for
the analytical HPLC method validation.

Figure 3 Radio-HPLC trace of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC. The peak corresponds
to (3), the thermodynamically more stable, and (4), the thermodynamically
less stable diastereomer, respectively.

The average retention times
of the first diasteroisomer of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC was
7.1 min and the second one was 7.2 min.
The calibration curve for the determination of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
was linear, and the linearity of this method was therefore statistically
confirmed (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Calibration curve obtained with the average values of peak areas
of 68Ga-PSMA.

The correlation coefficient (r2) for
the calibration curve was equal to 0.997, and the average CV % was
less than 2% (1.97%) which is in accordance with the acceptance criteria
(Table 3).

3 Clinical Use of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
At the University
Hospital of Parma, a Prostate Cancer Unit was
established in October 2014. The multidisciplinary team of the Prostate
Cancer Unit attends meetings every 2 weeks for case management to
provide care for patients with prostate cancer at all its stages.
The high-technology diagnostic procedures (choline-PET/CT, PSMA-PET/CT,
mpMR, and ultrasound/magnetic resonance imaging US/MRI fusion biopsy)
are decided by the team to guarantee appropriateness and optimization
of resource utilization.

We started the PET/CT diagnostic activity
of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
in April 2016 producing 123 batches for 162 patients with prostate
cancer for staging, restaging, and radiotherapy planning.

A
synthesis session was planned once per week at the beginning
of the new diagnostic activity, and then it was increased until now
with a daily production of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC.

Therefore,
it has become evident about how the process has to be
rapid and efficient in all phases and particularly during the QC steps.

4 Conclusions
The lack of specific literature about the
QCs of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC has led us to develop and validate
a simple and
reproducible analytical HPLC method to analyze the produced radiopharmaceutical
to implement it in the clinical setting.

Our validation protocol
for QC includes not only typical analytical
characteristics (% radiochemical purity, % radiochemical impurities,
chemical purity, pH, integrity filter, and radionuclidic purity) but
also precision, accuracy, specificity, limit of detection and quantitation,
linearity, and a range of HPLC methods to guarantee simple and safe
implementation in the diagnostic activity.

The developed chromatographic
method complied with all International
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) requirements during the course of
time.

These validation results demonstrate the suitability of
the method
in determining the radiochemical and chemical purity of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC.

More than 123 consecutive batches were analyzed
using this method
with the same results, thus proving its accuracy, robustness, and
repeatability for the routine clinical application.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Reagents and Chemical Syntheses
Synthesis
of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC was performed using 10 μg
of Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (ABX, Advanced Biochemical Compounds,
Radeberg, Germany).

The ligand was labeled with median 550 (300–800)
MBq 68GaCl3 (half-life, 67.6 min) eluted from
an IGG100 68Ge/68Ga generator (Eckert &
Ziegler, E&Z, Berlin, Germany) in a fully automated module (Scintomics
GRP, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany) in combination with good manufacturing
practice–grade disposable cassettes and reagent kit (ABX).

5.2 Synthesis Development
68GaCl3 was eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga
generator with 10 mL of sterile HCl (0.1 M) and collected into a prepurification
cation exchange column, which was then eluted with a solution of NaCl
(5 M). The eluate was added into the reaction vial, previously loaded
with PSMA-HBED-CC [10 μg in 1.5 M 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES buffer solution) at pH = 4]. The mixture was incubated
at 95 °C for 10 min.

The reaction mixture after incubation
was trapped onto a Sep-Pak C18 light cartridge, washed with water
for injection Ph. Eur., and eluted with 2 mL of ethanol/water in the
ratio of 1/1.

The final product was diluted with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline and sterilized by filtration through an inline 0.22 μm
sterile filter with a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane.

5.3 QC Analysis of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
Formulation
The standard QC tests for [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
were % radiochemical purity (HPLC), % radiochemical impurities of 68Ga3+ [HPLC and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)],
chemical purity (HPLC and gas chromatography), pH (pH strips), integrity
filter (pressure test), radionuclidic purity principal γ-photon, 68Ge content, 68Ga half-life (γ-ray spectrometry/counting),
and sterility/endotoxin assay (sterility test and Limulus amebocyte lysate test).

Chromatograms and instant TLC (ITLC)
strips (Varian iTLC-SG plates) were each analyzed with a scanner (Cyclone
Plus storage phosphor system, PerkinElmer), RT or Rf values were identified,
and then peaks were integrated to determine the % area of a 68Ga species as a proportion of the total area.

Additionally,
HPLC was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Acclaim 120 C18
column 3 μm 120 Å (3.0 mm × 150 mm) and a UV and a
γ-detector (Berthold Technologies, Milan, Italy). The used solvents
were (A) water +0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and (B) acetonitrile
+0.1% TFA. HPLC eluents, water, acetonitrile, and TFA were of high-grade
purity.

The flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 0.6 mL/min,
with a
total run of 12 min.

The following gradient was used upon HPLC
analysis: 0–2
min 3% B, 2–8 min 3% B to 60% B, 8–8.01 min 60% B to
90% B, 8.01–9 min 90% B, 9.01–12 min from 90% B to 3%
B. Flow rate: 0.6 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at
30 °C. For the detection of chemical impurities, the samples
were also monitored with a UV detector at 220 nm. The software system
Chromeleon 7 was used to assemble the information.

The natGa-labeled
reference Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-[Ga(HBED-CC)] (DKFZ-GaPSMA-11)
and the reference Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (PSMA-11) were purchased
from ABX Radeberg (Germany).

The γ-ray spectrometry tests
included the identification
of principal γ-photon (499–521 keV peak) and 68Ge content (decay of 499–521 keV peak ≥ 48 h) using
a large volume counter linked to a multichannel analyzer system (HPGe
detector ORTEC GEM 30P4-76).

The half-life of 68Ga
was calculated after measuring
the radioactivity of a sample in the dose calibrator at four consecutive
intervals (5, 10, 15, and 20 min) and then using the equation t1/2 = ln(1/2)/λ, where λ = decay
constant.

5.4 Standard Solution
Stock solutions
(5 μg/mL) and appropriate dilutions of Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC
(PSMA-11) and natGa-labeled reference Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-[Ga(HBED-CC)]
(DKFZ-GaPSMA-11) were prepared in CH3CN/H2O
(1:1) and stored at −20 °C.

5.5 Validation
of the HPLC Method To Determine
Chemical Purity
Validation of the analytical method for the
determination of chemical purity of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
was carried out according to ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines. The parameters
assessed for the validation were specificity, linearity, precision
(repeatability), accuracy, and LOQ.15 The
acceptance criteria for each parameter are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 Test and Acceptance Criteria in Determining
Chemical Purity Using HPLC
test	acceptance
criteria	
specificity	≥2.5	
linearity	R2 ≥ 0.99	
repeatability	CV % < 2%	
LOQ	CV % < 5%	
accuracy	bias % > 95%	
5.5.1 Specificity
Specificity determination
is performed by analyzing the mixture containing critical components
that might be present in the finished product [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC
solution and by demonstrating that the method is capable to distinguish
the various components present at the limited concentration for the
considered standards. The preparation method of the development of
[68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC was not considered for chemical impurities,
except for free gallium-68. Thus, analyses were performed using a
series of solutions containing [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC and
Ga-68.

5.5.2 Linearity
Determination of linearity
was done on sets of standard solutions with different concentrations
for each of the analytes of interest (Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and PSMA-11).
Such solutions are usually prepared by serial dilution starting from
a “mother” solution with the highest concentration (5,
4, 3.125, 1.25, and 0.8 μg/mL). The statistical function used
is linear regression with least squares. The curve equation, the correlation
coefficient, and the determination coefficient (r2) are calculated through the equation: y = ax + b, where y is the peak area, a is the slope, x is the analyte concentration, and b is the intercept.

5.5.3 Precision
Precision may be considered
at different levels as a measure of repeatability or intermediate
precision.

5.5.3.1 Repeatability
Repeatability may
be calculated based on the content of standard Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and
PSMA-11. The statistical parameter of concern is the CV % or RSD,
which is determined using the equation: CV % = s/m × 100, where s is the standard deviation
of the peak areas and m is the average of the peak
areas.

The data are obtained by injecting five times the sample
of the analytes with the concentration range used during the linearity
test.

5.5.4 Accuracy
Accuracy
is a measure
of the degree of conformity of a value generated by a specific procedure
to the assumed or accepted true value that is performed through bias
% value.

Bias % value measures the difference between the expectation
of test results about the different concentration for each of the
analytes of interest (Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and PSMA-11) and an accepted
reference value.

Acceptance criterion is bias % > 95%.

5.5.5 Limit of Quantitation
Experimental
LOQ has been determined by analyzing a series of diluted solutions
of Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and standard PSMA-11, until a concentration level
quantified with a precision >95% is reached. The experimental value
determined as above described the need to be confirmed through a precision
analysis, using a sample at a concentration corresponding to the found
LOQ. Acceptance criterion is CV % < 5%.

5.6 Validation of the HPLC Method To Determine
Radiochemical Purity
Validation of the analytical method
for the determination of radiochemical purity is presented here.

In Table 3, the validation parameters and their acceptance criteria
are summarized:

Table 3 Test and Acceptance Criteria in Determining
Radiochemical Purity Using HPLC
test	acceptance
criteria	
specificity	not applicable	
linearity	R2 ≥ 0.99	
repeatability	CV % < 2%	
LOQ	not applicable	
accuracy	not applicable	
In the validation of the methods for radioactive compounds,
some
of the ICH guidelines of validation parameters may not be of concern
and do not apply.

5.6.1 Linearity
Considering
the radioactive
nature and the short half-life of 68Ga, the typical experimental
approach based on the preparation of a series of solutions with different
concentrations does not apply. On the contrary, in this case, one
sample solution only, with a suitable radioactive concentration, is
analyzed five times, at defined time intervals (15 min). Indeed, the
radioactivity being the physical parameter of concern for radiochemical
detectors, the radionuclide decay itself provides the necessary linear
series of values. R2 may be extrapolated
from the calibration curve by analyzing five different radioactive
concentrations of [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC.

5.6.2 Precision
Precision may be considered
at different levels as a measure of repeatability or intermediate
precision.

5.6.2.1 Repeatability
Here, also the
same considerations apply as that described for linearity, that is,
the decay of the radionuclide 68Ga inevitably leads to
a decrease over time of the radioactivity. However, repeatability
may be evaluated by analyzing a series of HPLC runs obtained with
repetitive injections of a single [68Ga]-PSMA-HBED-CC sample
and by recalculating the obtained peak area values with the decay
equation: ln A0 = ln A + λt, where λ = 0,693/t1/2, A0 = corrected peak area, A = measured peak area, t = time interval
between the considered injection and the first one. t1/2 = half-life (68Ga = 67.63 min).

The
peak area values normalized for decay may then be compared and yield
a consistent statistical analysis. Average, standard deviation, and
CV % are then calculated.

Repeatability has to be determined
in three different days, to
verify the instrument outcome during the course of time.
