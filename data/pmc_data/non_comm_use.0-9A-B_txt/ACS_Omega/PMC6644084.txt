Hygroscopic properties and chemical
reactivity of secondary organic
aerosols (SOA) influence their overall contribution to the indirect
effect on the climate. In this study, we investigate the hygroscopic
properties of organic and organometallic polymeric particles, namely
polycatechol, polyguaiacol, Fe-polyfumarte, and Fe-polymuconate. These
particles efficiently form in iron-catalyzed reactions with aromatic
and aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compounds detected in field-collected
SOA. The structure of surface water was studied using diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and the uptake of
gas water was quantified using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as
a function of relative humidity. Spectroscopic data show that water
bonding with organic functional groups acting as hydrogen bond acceptors
causes shifts in their vibrational modes. Analysis of the hydroxyl
group stretching region revealed weak and strong hydrogen bonding
networks that suggest cluster formation reflecting water–water
and water–organics interactions, respectively. A modified Type
II multilayer Brunauer–Emmett–Teller adsorption model
described the adsorption isotherm on the nonporous materials, polycatechol,
polyguaiacol, and Fe-polymuconate. However, water adsorption on porous
Fe-polyfumarate was best described using a Type V adsorption model,
namely the Langmuir–Sips model that accounts for condensation
in pores. The data revealed that organometallic polymers are more
hygroscopic than organic polymers. The implications of these investigations
are discussed in the context of the chemical reactivity of these particles
relative to known SOA.

Introduction
Water is the solvent
that affects the chemical reactivity and physical
properties of atmospheric aerosols. There are molecular level differences
in the structure of water between bulk and interfacial environments
in atmospherically relevant systems.1−3 These differences originate
mainly from the number and strength of hydrogen bonds among water
molecules and acceptor/donor groups.4−7 Reactions in liquid droplets that mimic
chemistry in clouds were found to proceed at relatively lower rates
than surface reactions because of solvent cage effects.8−10 Surface water in sea spray, ammonium sulfate, and mineral dust particles
was shown to enhance ionic mobility, alter reaction pathways and surface
speciation, and influence the hygroscopic properties of particles
and their ability to form clouds.11−14 In primary and secondary organic
aerosol systems (POA and SOA), lab studies showed that temperature,
relative humidity (RH), and molecular composition affect the size,
viscosity, and phase state of these aerosols, which in turn affect
the relative importance of bulk versus surface reactions.15,16 In multicomponent aerosol systems containing organics, inorganic
salts, and water, changes in RH affect the aerosol liquid water (ALW)
content and pH.17,18 As a result, the morphology and
mixing state in the systems that can undergo deliquescence, efflorescence,
and liquid–liquid phase separation are directly dependent on
ALW content.19,20 Hence, measurements of water
uptake as a function of RH are the first step toward understanding
the reactivity of atmospheric aerosols. This is because water uptake
curves provide crucial information on the solute to solvent ratio
and surface area to volume ratio, which can be used to infer the surface
chemical composition and determine the reactivity of the particles.

One of the active areas of investigation in atmospheric chemistry
is particle nucleation and growth via secondary pathways in the atmosphere.
Processes that include atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from biogenic and anthropogenic sources, gas-particle partitioning,
and multiphase/heterogenous reactions contributed to our understanding
of SOA formation21−24 and better parameterization of global climate models.25 Following SOA formation, a number of chemical
and photochemical aging processes lead to the formation of light absorbing
soluble and insoluble components collectively known as “brown
carbon”.26 The role of transition
metals such as iron in the formation and aging of SOA is not well
understood.27 Iron is a ubiquitous component
of mineral dust, fly ash, and marine aerosols with speciation that
varies by the aerosol source.28−32 Uptake of acidic gases on iron-containing particles during long-range
transport enhances the fraction of soluble iron in particles.32−34 Also, the concentration of dissolved iron was found to be affected
by cycling between wet aerosols characterized by highly acidic conditions
with a few layers of adsorbed water and cloud droplets characterized
by more pH-neutral conditions.35 Hence,
given their rich chemistry, iron cations in (ALW) can catalyze a number
of reactions with the organic content of aerosols.

We recently
reported that Fe(III) in solution leads to the formation
of light absorbing secondary brown carbon via oxidative polymerization
of polyphenols and metal-catalyzed polymerization of dicarboxylic
acids.36,37 Polycatechol and polyguaiacol particles
were formed from the reaction with semi-volatile phenolic precursors
catechol and guaiacol emitted from biomass burning and produced by
photooxidation of aromatic VOCs.38 The
reactions with Fe(III) were carried out under high solute/solvent
ratio that mimic reactions in adsorbed water, with
mass yields approaching 50% relative to the concentration of the organic
precursor.36 Also, the reaction of soluble
Fe(III) with fumaric (trans-butenedioic) and muconic
(trans,trans-2,4-hexadienedioic)
acids, known photooxidation products of benzene, formed brightly colored
organometallic nanoparticles with nearly 30% Fe (w/w) and 90% mass
yields relative to the concentration of the acids.37 The mass-normalized absorption coefficients of Fe-polyfumarate
and Fe-polymuconate particles in the near UV light between 350 and
400 nm ranged from 1 to 8 m2 g–1, which
are on the same order of magnitude as black carbon and biomass burning
aerosols.37

The objective of this
study is to investigate the hygroscopic properties
of the aforementioned organic and organometallic particles, from the
molecular-level structure of surface water to water adsorption and
desorption isotherms as a function of RH. We utilized diffuse reflectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to collect spectra
of surface water in equilibrium with the gas phase. A quartz crystal
microbalance (QCM) was used to quantify water uptake as a function
of increasing and decreasing RH. We show that the presence of hydrogen
bonding acceptor groups in these polymers promote the formation of
adsorbed water clusters characterized by weak and strong hydrogen
bonds relative to liquid water. We also show that organometallic polymers
are more hygroscopic than organic polymers and can retain more water
with decreasing RH. The implications of these investigations are discussed
in the context of the chemical reactivity of these particles relative
to known SOA.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All
the chemicals were used as received without
further purification: catechol (1,2-benzendiol, >99%, CAS 120-80-9,
Sigma-Aldrich), guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol, ≥98%, CAS 90-05-1,
Sigma-Aldrich), fumaric acid (FA, trans-butenedioic
acid, ≥99%, CAS: 110-17-8, Sigma-Aldrich), muconic acid (MA, trans, trans-2,4-hexadienedioic acid, 98%,
CAS: 3588-17-8, Sigma-Aldrich), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 97%, CAS: 10025-77-1, Sigma-Aldrich),
and diamond powder (5 ± 2 μm, Lands Superabrasives LST600T).

The synthesis procedure of polycatehcol and polyguaiacol is reported
in ref (36), and that
for Fe-polyfumarate and Fe-polymuconate in ref (37). Briefly, aqueous phase
standard solutions of iron chloride, catechol, and guaiacol were prepared
by dissolving the chemicals in Milli-Q water (18.5 MΩ cm) with
the solutions’ ionic strength adjusted to 0.01 M by adding
potassium chloride (KCl powder, 99.5%, EM Science) in order to stabilize
the pH reading. The pH was adjusted using stock solutions of hydrochloric
acid (HCl 6 N, Ricca Chemical Company) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH
pellets, 99–100%, EMD). The concentration of the organic precursors
was 1 mM in 100 mL, to which 2 mL of the iron chloride solution was
added to start the reaction in the dark for 2 h. To get the maximum
yield, the initial pH was adjusted to 3 for experiments with catechol
and guaiacol, and 5 for experiments with fumaric and muconic acids.
The resulting iron to organic molar ratio after mixing is 2:1. The
reaction solution was then filtered on nylon membrane filters (0.2
μm pore size, 47 mm dia., EMD Millipore) using a suction filtration
system (VWR). After filtration, the products were air dried overnight.
The filters were weighed before and after filtration to measure the
mass of the product. The organic polymers were then scratched from
the filter using a spatula into a clean vial till further use. Some
of the material collected on the filters was analyzed for Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area using N2 gas in a Nova 2200e multigas
surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments). The surface area
values were found to be 4 ± 0.6, 14 ± 2, 36 ± 5, 6
± 1 m2 g–1 for polycatechol, polyguaiacol,
Fe-polyfumarate, and Fe-polymuconate, respectively.

DRIFTS Experiments
Samples were prepared for the gas
phase water uptake experiments by mixing about 7–20 ×
10–3 g of the organic polymers (ground using a grinding
mill, wig-L-bug, for 30 s) with ∼0.30 g diamond powder in a
stainless-steel crucible followed by mechanical shaking for 60 s without
the grinding ball. This procedure was found to result in homogenous
and reproducible samples. The samples were then poured into the reaction
cup of a stainless-steel high temperature reaction chamber treated
with a special SilcoSteel-CR coating (HVC, cup 6 by 3 mm, dome cover
with two Ge windows and one quartz viewing window, Harrick Scientific).
Efficient and reproducible packing of the sample was obtained using
a 4 kg weight for 15 min placed on top of a custom-made T-shape stainless
steel cover with similar dimensions to the reaction cup.39 The reaction chamber is then mounted into the
praying mantis diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick, DRK-4N18).
The DRIFTS accessory was installed into a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer
(Thermo Instruments) equipped a liquid N2-cooled mercury
cadmium telluride detector and a purge gas generator (Parker/Balston
Analytical Gas Systems Purge Gas Generator 75-52).

The reaction
chamber has two ports for flowing gases and was connected to a gas
handling system described earlier.40 Briefly,
purged air flowing into a water bubbler containing 18.2 MΩ cm
ultrapure water was mixed with dry air in a glass chamber. In one
set of experiments using polyguaiacol as a sample, liquid D2O (99.9 atom % D, Sigma Aldrich) replaced the ultrapure water in
the bubbler to flow gas phase D2O. The RH of the gas mixture
was varied by changing the settings on two mass flow controllers (MKS).
A RH sensor (Vaisala HM70) was used to monitor the RH of the gas exiting
the chamber. The same gas handling system was used in the QCM experiments
described below.

In a typical DRIFTS experiments, dry air was
flown over the sample
in the reaction chamber overnight at room temperature. The Fe-polyfumarate
sample was heated to 50 °C to enhance desorption of gases trapped
in the pores of that material. A single beam spectrum was collected
for the “dry” sample first, followed by introducing
humid air as a function of increasing RH. All spectra were collected
at 8 cm–1 resolution by averaging 100 scans. Absorbance
spectra of surface water were generated by referencing the single
beam spectra collected while flowing humid air to the spectrum collected
initially for the dry sample. Similar experiments were conducted using
a mirror (Harrick) in place of the reaction chamber to collect spectra
of gas phase water. These spectra were used to subtract out gas phase
water lines from the absorbance spectra of surface water. Control
experiments were also conducted where diamond powder only was packed
into the reaction chamber (no organic polymer sample). These spectra
were used to subtract out contributions to the absorbance features
from the sample spectra.

QCM Experiments
Gas phase water
uptake experiments
on thin films of polycatechol, polyguaiacol, Fe-polyfumarate, and
Fe-polymucanate were performed using a commercial QCM (eQCM 10 M,
Gamry Instruments). The QCM houses a 0.550″ dia. gold-coated
quartz crystal (5 MHz) on which the thin organic films were deposited.
The QCM crystal connected to the resonator was mounted onto a custom-made
clamp-shaped holder with a cover containing two ports and an opening
to insert a RH sensor (Sensirion, EK-H5). The gas handling system
described above for the DRIFTS experiments was connected to a gas
mixing chamber to control the RH of the air flowing over the abovementioned
samples. A RH sensor (Vaisala HUMICAP HM70) was placed in the gas
line directly before the QCM sample holder. The polycatechol film
was prepared by depositing a total volume of 60.0 μL using a
25 μL syringe (Hamilton Co.) from 5.0 mg mL–1 solution (prepared in 6:4 H2O–EtOH mixture and
sonicated for 40 min). The polyguaiacol film was prepared by depositing
a total volume of 60.0 μL from 1.7 mg mL–1 solution (prepared in 6:4 H2O–EtOH mixture and
sonicated for 10 s). In case of Fe-polyfumarate, the film was prepared
by depositing total volume of 44.0 μL from a 0.83 mg mL–1 solution (prepared in 6:4 EtOH–H2O mixture and sonicated for 40 min). However, the Fe-polymuconate
film was prepared by depositing total volume of 44.0 μL from
a 2.5 mg mL–1 solution (prepared in 4.5:5.5 EtOH–H2O mixture and sonicated for 40 min). The diameter of the film
was measured after the solvent dried and found to be ca. 0.8 ±
0.1 cm. Each film was allowed to dry overnight under a flow of dry
air. In a typical QCM experiment, the initial frequency baseline was
recorded while flowing dry air, and then humid air was introduced
to dry air starting with the lowest RH value followed by incrementally
increasing the mass flow of humid air, while allowing 30 min for equilibrium
at each RH value for the adsorption part of the experiment.
The total mass flow of humid and dry air was maintained at 500 sccm.
Once the highest RH is obtained, the mass flow of the humid air is
decreased incrementally, while allowing 30 min for equilibrium at
each RH to record the desorption part of the experiment.
Separate experiments were run for longer than 30 min to confirm achieving
equilibrium, which is defined as the time at which insignificant change
was observed in frequency with time. We found that allowing 30 min
for equilibrium for all samples was long enough to cover as many RH
values before the balance showed signs of electrical instability.

Results and Discussion
Structure of Surface Water on Polycatechol
and Polyguaiacol
The structure of surface water on polycatechol
and polyguaiacol
mixed with diamond powder (used to enhance scattering efficiency of
the samples) was studied using DRIFTS as a function of increasing
RH over samples dried overnight by a flow of dry air (RH < 1%). Figures S1a and S1b show the DRIFTS absorbance
spectra of the dry samples. These spectra were obtained by referencing
to the spectrum of dry diamond powder only. The spectral range 2000–1000
cm–1 contains fundamental vibrational modes of the
functional groups in the polymer backbone of polycatechol and polyguaiacol,
namely stretching vibrations (ν) because of C–C, C–O,
and aromatic −C=C– modes. The spectra are identical
to those reported earlier by our group for dry thin films using attenuated
total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR–FTIR) (see the Supporting Information in ref (36)). The absorbance features
for the organic polymers are clearly distinguishable from the monomers,
whether in the solid or aqueous phases.36,41Scheme 1 shows the suggested general
structure of these polymers.42−44

Scheme 1 General Structure
of Units in Polycatechol and Polyguaiacol Formed
in Oxidative Polymerization Reactions
The presence of ν(C=O) cannot be excluded
with certainty
because of the broadness of the feature in the 2000–1000 cm–1 range, and because mass spectrometry studies on the
soluble products of the guaiacol dimerization reactions reported structures
containing C=O.45 Also, the spectral
range 3600–2500 cm–1 contains features assigned
to ν(C–H) and ν(O–H). The former mode is
more intense for polyguaiacol compared to polycatechol because of
the presence of −CH3 groups. The broad feature centered
around 3400 cm–1 originates from hydrogen bonded
−OH groups, whether with neighboring units or residual water
molecules not removed by flowing dry air at room temperature. As detailed
below, understanding the structure of the dry material aids in interpreting
the spectra obtained as a function of RH.

Figures 1a and 1b show representative
DRIFTS absorbance spectra
collected as a function of increasing % RH (solid lines) on polycatechol
and polyguaiacol mixed with diamond powder samples (2% w/w). Control
experiments were conducted on diamond powder only (no organic polymers)
under the same conditions (dotted lines). These spectra were obtained
by referencing to the spectrum of the dry organic polymer or diamond
powder, respectively. Hence, the spectral features observed are due
to increasing the coverage of surface water characterized by the nearly
symmetric bending mode, δ(H2O), between 1630 and
1645 cm–1 and broad absorbance, ν(OH), in
the range 3600–2500 cm–1. There are other
clear differences in the spectra of the samples versus the control
that cannot be assigned to surface water. To isolate these features,
the spectra in Figures 3a and 3b were normalized to the intensity
of the peak at 3421 cm–1, and then the normalized
diamond spectrum was subtracted out from the corresponding spectrum
for polycatechol and polyguaiacol. This spectral subtraction procedure
of normalized spectra removes the contribution of concentration to
absorbance. Hence, the net spectra highlight changes to functional
groups because of water adsorption. The resultant difference spectra
are shown in Figure 1c,d, and the assignment of the features is listed in Table 1. The ν(OH) peaks at 3580
and 3020 cm–1 for polycatechol and 3580 and 3170
cm–1 for polyguaiacol suggest the presence of surface
water with hydroxyl groups involved in weak and strong hydrogen bonding,
respectively. Similar features were observed for water adsorption
on tannic acid,40 where water adsorbs in
clusters, and water molecules in contact with organic groups have
fewer hydrogen bonds compared to the interior of water clusters that
resemble liquid water or ice. Also, the difference spectra show changes
in the 1800–1000 cm–1, suggesting changes
to the frequency of the organic functional groups in polycatechol
and polyguaiacol with increasing coverage of surface water. The negative
feature at 1153 cm–1 in Figure 1c is associated with ν(C–O)
and δ(OH), which are hydrogen bonding accepting groups. A similar
result was obtained from water adsorption on tannic acid.40 The positive features at 1701, 1585, 1265 cm–1 for polycatechol, and 1585 and 1385 cm–1 for polyguaiacol suggest changes to the aromatic −C=C–
vibrations because of the presence of surface water. Water–benzene
interactions were studied theoretically47−50 and in the gas phase51 because benzene is polarizable and consequently
participates in the hydrogen bonding network of water.

(solid lines) in ca. 2% w/w organic material/diamond powder. The dotted
lines are control spectra collected on diamond particles only (no
organic material) at the same % RH values. Data in (c,d) show the
difference in normalized absorbance spectra as a function of RH obtained
by subtracting the normalized diamond spectrum from that collected
with organic materials at each % RH with a factor 1. The normalization
of all spectra was done relative to the peak at 3421 cm–1. The “*” denotes residual features observed only in
the control spectra.

To further explore the assignment of the spectral
features near
δ(H2O), namely 1585 cm–1, experiments
were conducted by flowing D2O vapor over a polyguaiacol/diamond
sample. Because this spectral feature became apparent in the difference
of normalized spectra for the polycatechol/diamond sample (Figure 1c), the results obtained
with the polyguaiacol isotopic exchange experiments are also applicable
to the polycatechol sample. Solid lines in Figures 2 and S2 show the absorbance spectra collected as a function of
increasing % RH in the spectral ranges 1800–1000 and 4000–2000
cm–1, respectively. The dotted lines in these figures
are for spectra collected while flowing H2O vapor from
a Millipore water source. The solid lines in Figure 2 clearly show the disappearance of the feature
at 1643 cm–1 assigned to δ(H2O)
because of isotopic exchange. The positive symmetrical feature at
1265 cm–1 is assigned to the bending mode of isotopically
labeled surface water because it is closer to the frequency of the
δ(D2O) in the liquid phase (1206 cm–1)52 than that of liquid HDO at 1450 cm–1.53 The nearly 60 cm–1 blue shift can be attributed to structural differences
in the hydrogen bonding network in surface water compared to the liquid
phase. The features at 1666 and 1585 cm–1 were not
affected by isotopic exchange confirming their assignment to aromatic
−C=C– vibrations.

Figure 2 Selected DRIFTS absorbance
spectra of surface water collected as
a function of increasing % RH on a 2% w/w polyguaiacol/diamond sample.
The solid lines are spectra collected using gas phase D2O. The dotted lines are the same spectra shown in Figure 1b collected using gas phase
H2O at 5.5, 25, 41, and 86% RH.

The negative features at 1435 and 1380 cm–1 and
the positive feature at 1138 cm–1 are only present
while flowing D2O and they increase in intensity with increasing
% RH. Because the spectrum of the “dry” sample was used
as a reference to generate the absorbance spectra shown in Figure 2, the observed negative
and positive features suggest the presence of residual surface water
not removed with sample drying with dry air flow at room temperature
overnight. As shown in Table 1, 1380 cm–1 and—by extension—the
adjacent band at 1435 cm–1 frequencies are assigned
to aromatic δ(OH)ar coupled with aromatic ν(C–C)ar. Because OH groups and the π system of the benzene
ring are hydrogen (deuterium) bond acceptor groups,49,50 it is likely that H/D isotopic exchange in surface water directly
bonded with them affected the δ(OH)ar and ν(C–C)ar fundamental frequencies.

Moreover, the spectral range
4000–2000 cm–1 shows changes to the ν(OH)
features at 3580, 3421, and 3170
cm–1 observed in Figure 1b due to H/D isotopic exchange with gas phase
D2O (solid lines). For comparison, the dotted lines in Figure S2 show the same spectra in Figure 1b collected using gas phase
H2O. The new positive features at 2654, 2530, and 2376
cm–1 are assigned to ν(OD) in surface water.
The ratio of the corresponding ν(OH) to the ν(OD) is nearly
1.35, which is very close to the ratio obtained from the reduced masses,  = 1.38. This ratio is also close to that
obtained from the symmetric and asymmetric OH(D) stretch in liquid
H2O and D2O, 1.36.52 Again, the observed positive and negative features in Figure S2 suggest the presence of residual surface
water that undergo H/D isotopic exchange with increasing flow of D2O vapor. In summary, gas phase water adsorption on polycatechol
and polyguaiacol occurs with hydrogen bonding acceptor groups in these
organic polymers, leading to the formation of clusters with water–organic
and water–water hydrogen bonds that cause shifts in the vibrational
modes of the functional groups by direct contact with surface water.
The next section shows data for water adsorption on iron-containing
aliphatic organometallic polymers for comparison with the aromatic
organic polymers discussed above.

Structure of Surface Water
on Fe-Polyfumarate and Fe-Polymuconate
Figures 3a and 3b show representative
DRIFTS absorbance spectra
of water adsorption on dry Fe-polyfumarate and Fe-polymuconate samples
as a function of increasing % RH (solid lines). These spectra were
obtained by referencing to the spectrum of the dry samples following
overnight flow of dry air (Figures S1c and S1d). The dry spectra are identical to those reported earlier by our
group for thin films using ATR–FTIR.37 The absorbance features for these organometallic polymers were assigned
based on the structure of the organic precursors and data obtained
from analyzing the solid particles using electron energy loss spectroscopy
and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Scheme 2 shows the suggested structure of these organometallic
polymers formed in the aqueous phase reaction of FeCl3 with
fumaric and muconic acids at pH 5, respectively.37

Figure 3 Selected DRIFTS absorbance spectra of surface water collected as
a function of increasing % RH on (a) Fe-polyfumarate and (b) Fe-polymuconate
(solid lines) in ca. 7% w/w organic material/diamond particles. The
dotted lines are control spectra collected on diamond particles only
(no organic material) at the same % RH values. Data in (c,d) show
the difference in normalized absorbance spectra as a function of RH
obtained by subtracting the normalized diamond spectrum from that
collected with organic materials at each RH with a factor of 1. The
normalization of all spectra was done relative to the peak at 3421
cm–1. The “*” denotes residual features
observed only in the control spectra.

Scheme 2 Suggested Structure of Units in Fe-Polyfumarate and Fe-Polymuconate37
The spectral range 2000–1000 cm–1 contains
aliphatic ν(−C=C−), ν(−C=O),
ν(−C(O)O−), and ν(C–O). The latter
three functional groups are considered hydrogen bonding acceptors.
The iron centers in these organometallic polymers contain water molecules
and hydroxyl ligands capable of hydrogen bonding with surface water
as well. The dotted lines in Figure 3a,b are the same as shown in Figure 1a,b for water uptake on diamond powder only.
Increasing % RH resulted in increasing the absorbance assigned to
ν(OH) and δ(H2O) centered at 3421 and 1632
cm–1. There are also other clear differences in
the spectra of surface water on the samples versus the control with
increasing % RH. These differences include the structure of the ν(OH)
broad band, increasing absorbance at 1705 and 1223 cm–1 (Fe-polyfumarate) and 1686 cm–1 (Fe-polymuconate),
and decreasing absorbance at 1516 and 1446 cm–1 (Fe-polyfumarate)
and 1416 cm–1 (Fe-polymuconate). To better isolate
these features, the spectra in Figure 3a and 3b were normalized to
the intensity of the peak at 3421 cm–1, and then
the normalized diamond spectrum was subtracted out from the corresponding
spectrum for Fe-polyfumarate and Fe-polymuconate (Figure 3c and 3d). Table 1 lists
the assignment of the features observed in Figure 3c and 3d. This subtraction
procedure clearly revealed the spectral features responsible for the
structure in the ν(OH) broad band, namely 3641, 3564 cm–1, and the feature near 3020 cm–1. The former frequencies indicate the presence of OH functional groups
involved in weak hydrogen bonding such as those in direct contact
with the hydrophobic part of the polymers. The sharp negative features
near 3020 cm–1 suggest changes to ν(C–H)46 in the aliphatic backbone of the polymers as
a result of water adsorption and the formation of weak OH···π
hydrogen bonds.54 The tailing of the OH
broad band till 2500 cm–1 is characteristic of hydrogen
bonding network on organic particles and films and is correlated with
the presence of stronger hydrogen bonds relative to those in the liquid
phase of water.40,55,56

In addition, the negative features in the 1800–1200
cm–1 spectral range (Figures 3c and 3d) appear at
1620, 1516, and 1446 cm–1 for Fe-polyfumarate, and
1628 and 1416 cm–1 for Fe-polymuconate. As listed
in Table 1, vibrational
modes in this range are assigned to ν(−C(O)O−)
and ν(−C=C−). These functional groups are
hydrogen bonding acceptor groups and hence, water adsorption appears
to change their fundamental vibrational frequency relative to the
“dry” sample. The positive features at 1705 cm–1 for Fe-polyfumarate and 1686 cm–1 for Fe-polymuconate
suggest weakening of the C=O relative to the dry sample, where
ν(C=O) appeared at 1710 and 1701 cm–1, respectively (Figures S1c and S1d).
Also, the positive feature 1223 cm–1 for polyfumarate
is assigned to ν(C–O), which is higher than the 1215
cm–1 peak observed in the dry sample. While the
difference is within the resolution of our measurements, the slight
blue shift might indicate an effect of hydrogen bonding on C–O
groups. In summary, ligands on the metal centers and hydrogen bonding
acceptor groups in Fe-polyfumarate and Fe-polymuconate interact within
adsorbed water, forming clusters characterized by weaker and stronger
hydrogen bonds relative to liquid water. The formation of these clusters
causes shifts in the vibrational modes of the organic groups in direct
contact with surface water. With this understanding of the structure
of surface water on organic and organometallic polymers of atmospheric
relevance, the next section quantifies water uptake as a function
of % RH with mathematical models that best describe the hygroscopicity
of these materials.

Adsorption Thermodynamics
To obtain
thermodynamic parameters
for gas phase water adsorption on the organic polymers studied herein,
a QCM was used to quantify the amount of surface water as a function
of % RH. For these experiments, thin films of the organic polymers
were deposited on a gold-coated quartz crystal with an oscillation
frequency of 5 MHz. The amount of the deposited organic films was
optimized such that it is small enough not to change the oscillating
frequency of the QCM crystal and large enough to observe changes in
frequency because of gas phase water adsorption. The change in frequency,
ΔF, due to gas phase water adsorption or desorption
are converted to change in mass, Δm, according
to the Sauerbrey equation: ΔF = −CfΔm, where Cf (Hz cm2 g–1) is a sensitivity
factor unique to a particular crystal. The unit for area (cm2) assumes that the material coats the entire exposed area of the
QCM crystal. To quantify surface water, the value of Cf was obtained from calibration experiments using droplets
of liquid water with amounts that give rise to linear ΔF versus Δm. Because of the high
surface tension of water, these droplets did not cover the exposed
area of the QCM crystal. The geometrical contact area of the droplets
with the QCM crystal was calculated and multiplied by ΔF. This way, the slope of the line of area-corrected ΔF versus Δm would have units of Hz
cm2 g–1. The value of Cf from the water calibration experiments was found to
be 22564 ± 1519 Hz cm2 g–1.

Figures S3 and S4 show raw QCM data as
a function of time and % RH (2–88%) on dry polycatechol, polyguaiacol,
Fe-polyfumarate, and Fe-polymuconate, respectively. Representative
images of the thin films deposited on the QCM crystal are shown to
the right of the raw data. Increasing % RH of the humid air flowing
over the films results in negative ΔF, which
was calculated relative to the initial frequency while flowing dry
air. The decrease in frequency indicates a positive Δm due to the increase in the coverage of surface water.
Upon decreasing % RH of the humid air flowing over the film, values
of ΔF become less negative, which correlates
with water desorption from the films. The ΔF values were corrected for the geometrical area of the deposited
films and then converted to the amount of surface water, Δm, using the Cf value mentioned
above. To show the adsorption and desorption isotherms of surface
water on organic polymer thin films, the left axes in Figure 4 are for Δm values versus % RH, and the right axes are the corresponding mass
of surface water normalized to the surface area of the deposited organic
film. The latter is useful for comparing water uptake on different
materials to examine their relative hygroscopic properties.

isotherms at 298 K constructed from the data shown
in Figures S3 and S4 for (a) polycatechol
(0.3 mg), (b) polyguaiacol (0.1 mg), (c) Fe-polyfumarate (0.037 mg),
and (d) Fe-polymuconate (0.1 mg) using the equation Δm = −ΔF/Cf, where Δm is the change in mass
due to adsorbed water (left axis). ΔF was multiplied
by the geometrical area of the deposited films. The right axes were
calculated by converting Δm to water mass (g)
per surface area (m2) of the organic film deposited. The
lines through the data represent least-squares best fits to the experimental
data. The best fit parameters are listed in Table 2. The outermost right axis was obtained by
dividing water coverage in g m–2 by that at the
monolayer coverage obtained from the best-fit parameters. The error
bars represent the standard deviation (±σ) from the average
data of 3–4 water isotherm experiments, each on a freshly-prepared
organic film.

The shape of the adsorption
isotherms in Figure 4a,b,d is similar to Type II isotherms that
indicate multilayer adsorption modeled using the 2-fit parameter BET
model.13,57 This model was derived for adsorption on
uniform surfaces with infinite number of layers. However, for adsorption
on heterogeneous particles such as the organic polymers studied herein,
adsorption results in the formation of a finite number of layers.
A modified 3-fit parameter BET model was described by Goodman et al.
that takes into account the finite number of layers58 1  where m is the surface coverage
of water (g m–2), mML is the monolayer surface coverage of water (g m–2), c is a unitless temperature-dependent constant
related to the enthalpies of adsorption of the first, ΔH1°, and subsequent layers (expressed as the standard enthalpy for water
vapor condensation, ΔHcond° = −44 kJ mol–1), c = exp(−[ΔH1° – ΔHcond°]/RT),and n is a unitless fitting parameter that represents the maximum
number of layers of adsorbed species and is related to the pore size
and properties of the adsorbent, R is the gas constant
and T is temperature in K. The best fit parameters
using the modified BET adsorption model to the data shown in Figure 4a,b,d are listed
in Table 2. The outermost right axis in these figures shows water
coverage in monolayers calculated relative to mML obtained from the fits.

The trend
in the values of the best-fit parameters: mML, n, and c for water
adsorption of polycatechol, polyguaiacol, and Fe-polymuconate reflects
their affinity to water based on their chemical structure. Both polycatechol
and polyguaiacol are more hydrophobic than Fe-polymuconate. Both organic
polymer films with substituted benzene ring units result in the formation
of a water monolayer at later % RH values (16 and 45%) compared to
14% for Fe-polymuconate, which is an organometallic film with aliphatic
dicarboxylic acid units connected through iron centers that favor
water as ligands. This higher affinity toward water is evident in
the values of n, where Fe-polymuconate takes up nearly
double the maximum number of layers observed for polycatechol and
polyguaiacol. In addition, the formation of the monolayer water coverage
on Fe-polymuconate is more exothermic than on polycatechol and polyguaiacol.
The presence of the methyl substituents in polyguaiacol compared to
hydroxyl groups in polycatechol resulted in a value for ΔH1° close to ΔHcond°. This result suggests that water–water
hydrogen bonding interactions dominate over water–polyguaiacol
hydrogen bonding. For polycatechol, hydroxyl substituents are involved
in hydrogen bonding with surface water resulting in higher ΔH1° than ΔHcond°.

The shape of the water adsorption
isotherm on Fe-polyfumarate in Figure 4c is different from
that observed for Fe-polymuconate. The S-shaped curve is characteristic
of a Type V isotherm typically observed for gas phase adsorption on
porous materials, where pore condensation takes place.59 A similar isotherm shape was observed for N2 gas adsorption at 77 K as shown in Figure S5. The model used to fit the S-shaped isotherm shown in Figure 4c is the Langmuir–Sips
isotherm model, which accounts for monolayer adsorption according
to the Langmuir isotherm at low pressure, and capillary condensation
described by the Sips isotherm at moderate to high pressure60  where m and RH are
defined
above, msat. is the saturation surface
coverage (g m–2), n is a fitting
parameter characteristic of the heterogeneity of the surface, K1 and K2 are surface
affinity parameters at low and moderate/high vapor pressure regions,
respectively. As summarized by Inglezakis et al.,60 this composite isotherm was used to describe the adsorption
of polar and nonpolar organic compounds on mesoporous silicate and
water adsorption on a silica-based high-purity spherical gel. The
best-fit parameters using the Langmuir–Sips adsorption model
to the data shown in Figure 4c are listed in Table 2. The outermost right axis in this figure shows water coverage
in monolayers calculated relative to msat., obtained from the fit. The S-shaped isotherm is a direct consequence
of the porous structure of Fe-polyfumarate, which is apparent in the
high resolution transmission electron microscopy images shown in Figure S6. The value msat. (corresponding to 1 ML) occurred at 43% RH indicating complete condensation
of water in the pores. The values of K1 and K2 suggest that water–water
interactions due to condensation in the pores at moderate to high
% RH are more favorable than water–polyfumarate interactions
at low % RH.

Also shown in Figure 4 is the extent of water desorption as a result
of decreasing % RH from the highest value reached
during adsorption. Within the
uncertainty and over the time frame of the measurements, there is
no hysteresis observed in the case of polycatechol and polyguaiacol
because of weak adsorbate–adsorbent and adsorbate–adsorbate
interactions. The Fe-polyfumarate sample shows no hysteresis above
50% RH, and water retention at RH values below 40% RH. The largest
hysteresis is observed in the case of Fe-polymuconate, where at 30%
RH—for example—the sample contains nearly double the
amount of water in the desorption part relative to the adsorption
part of the experiment. This suggests that the desorption
kinetics are slower than adsorption kinetics over the 30
min allowed for equilibrium at % RH. Such behavior would have consequences
on the chemical and physical properties of aerosols containing organometallic
polymers as explained below in the Conclusions and Significance section.

Conclusions and Significance
In this study, we investigated
the hygroscopic properties of organic
and organometallic polymeric particles formed in iron-catalyzed reactions
with aromatic and aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compounds detected in
field-collected SOA. The structure of surface water was studied using
DRIFTS, where it was clear that water bonding with organic functional
groups acting as hydrogen bond acceptors caused shifts in their vibrational
modes. There was also evidence for weak and strong hydrogen bonding
networks that suggest cluster formation with water–water and
water–organics interactions, respectively. In addition, gas
phase water adsorption and desorption isotherms collected as a function
of RH was best modeled using a modified Type II multilayer BET adsorption
model on nonporous materials, namely polycatechol, polyguaiacol, and
Fe-polymuconate. Water adsorption on porous Fe-polyfumarate was best
described using a Type V adsorption model, namely the Langmuir–Sips
model that accounts for condensation in pores.

The results presented
herein are significant because global climate
models25 need better parametrization of
the hygroscopic properties and chemical reactivity of SOA. Of the
organic and organometallic polymeric particles studied here, the shape
of the adsorption isotherm of water on polyguaiacol is similar to
particle growth factor curves (ranging from 1.1 to 1.2) obtained for
SOA formed by oxidation of cycloalkenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes.61 Gas phase water adsorption isotherms on the
other polymers, polycatechol and Fe-polymuconate, show that they have
higher affinity for water, particularly below 20% RH relative to other
SOA. The hygroscopic behavior of Fe-polyfumarate is the most unique
given its porous structure, and the shape of the adsorption isotherm
has not been observed before for atmospheric aerosols. This adsorption
isotherm resembles those obtained from water uptake on metal organic
frameworks owing to their extensive network of pores.62 As mentioned in the introduction, water structure and hygroscopic
properties are the first step to understanding the surface chemistry
of atmospheric aerosols. The organic polymers studied have chemical
structures (unsaturated bonds, benzene rings, iron centers) that cause
their light absorbing properties to appear in the UV–visible
region. The fact that these materials can adsorb water even at low
% RH suggests that water will play a role in their photoreactivity
and electron transfer processes, whether at the surface or in the
pores as in the case of Fe-polyfumarate. Hence, these reactions will
impact their aging, atmospheric residence time, and impact on gas
phase composition. This work is currently underway in our labaratory.
