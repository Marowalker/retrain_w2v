A layered
titanate, K2Ti4O9, is
intercalated with various n-alkylamines through ion-exchange
reaction in aqueous medium. On heating, the intercalated amine is
partially deintercalated, yielding nitrogen-doped amine-intercalated
titanates. The modified titanates are studied as catalysts in methylene
blue degradation under UV irradiation. Heat-treated long-chain amine
titanates exhibit better photocatalytic activity in comparison to
short chain amine titanates. The improved catalytic activity could
be attributed to two factors: (i) increased surface access as the
titanate layers are well separated, pillared by the alkylamine chains
and (ii) nitrogen doping.

1 Introduction
A layered
titanate, K2Ti4O9,1,2 is
of interest as a potential material for energy and environmental
applications—lithium-ion battery electrode,3 photovoltaics,4 and photocatalysis.5−10 It belongs to a class of materials with a general formula M2O·nTiO2 (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs).
K2Ti4O9 consists of negatively charged
two-dimensional (2D) layers wherein TiO6 octahedral units
are connected through shared corners and edges with K+ ions
occupying the interlamellar space.5,11,12 K2Ti4O9, structurally
related to TiO2, is also a semiconductor with a band gap
of 3.54 eV and has been explored as a potential material for various
photocatalytic reactions—phenol decomposition,13 methanol oxidation,14 and water
reduction.8,15 Though TiO2 and its analogues
exhibit good photostability, their photocatalytic efficiency is limited
by absorption of only UV rays (<10% of the solar spectrum) because
of their intrinsic wide band gap.1,2,16 Band gap engineering,16,17 through hybridization17−19 of TiO2 with metal/semiconductor nanostructures or doping
with transition metals16,17,20 or nonmetals (N, C),17,21,22 has proven to be effective in extending the absorption into the
visible region of the spectrum and thus enhancing the photocatalytic
efficiency. N-doping, in particular, has been an effective strategy
to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. N-doping
has been achieved through sputtering of TiO2 in a N2 atmosphere,21 annealing in the
presence of ammonia,21,23 solvothermal reactions,24,25 or through direct amination (at ambient/low temperature) of TiO2 nanostructures using triethylamine.26−28

K2Ti4O9 exhibits ion-exchange
property,29−31 wherein the interlayer K+ ions can be
exchanged for other cations of varying sizes [H+, RNH3+, or tetrabutylammonium ion (TBA+)],2,5,32 resulting in varied interlayer
spacings and environments that also aid in the exfoliation in suitable
solvents (polar/nonpolar) to yield nanosheets.33 Ion-exchange has been shown to alter the band gap in this
system. Allen et al.5 reported a decrease
in the band gap in the order K2Ti4O9 (3.54 eV) > H2Ti4O9 (3.25 eV)
>
TBA2Ti4O9 (3.00 eV) on exchange of
K+ for H+ or TBA+. The band gap reduction
has been attributed to two main factors: (i) change in composition
of the phases and (ii) in-plane and edge defects caused because of
exfoliation. Di Quarto et al.34 predicted
that the band gap of a metal oxide increases as a function of the
square of the difference in Pauling electronegativities (ENs) of the
metal and oxygen components. Hence, exchange of K+ (EN
= 0.8) with H+ (EN = 2.2), whose EN is comparable to oxygen
(EN = 3.5), leads to a reduction of the band gap.34 A decrease in the band gap has been observed on intercalation
of n-alkylamine in layered titanates.33

Layered K2Ti4O9, on hybridization
with CdS nanostructures8,9/oxide nanoparticles6,24,35−39 (TiO2, SnO2, CrOx, and SiO2) or on cation-exchange40,41 - (Co2+ and Sn2+), exhibits enhanced photocatalysis.
Layered titanates doped with nitrogen, obtained through solvothermal
reaction in the presence of triethylamine,6 calcination in the presence of ammonia42/urea,35 or photo-N doping43 in a N2 atmosphere, also exhibit
enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Interlayer modified titanates
have been largely unexplored as photocatalysts.
In this context, n-alkylamine (C4–C18)-intercalated titanates are investigated here as photocatalysts
toward dye degradation. As the interaction between the interlayer
amines and titanate layers, upon heat treatment, is expected to lead
to N-doping of the titanate layers, one could anticipate improved
catalytic performance from these materials.

2 Results
and Discussion
Amine titanates with n-alkylamines
of varying
alkyl chain lengths [n-butylamine (BA), n-hexylamine (HA), n-octylamine (OA), n-dodecylamine (DDA), and n-octadecylamine (ODA)]
were prepared through ion exchange as depicted in Figure 1. Amine titanates formed by
reacting K2Ti4O9 with n-alkylamines in aqueous medium remain white as K2Ti4O9. When the amine titanates were subjected to
heating at 110 °C, they turned brown (Figure 1), indicating nitrogen doping as observed
in the literature.1

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of formation of nitrogen doped amine titanates.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of amine titanates before
and
after heat treatment are shown in Figure 2A and Supporting Information, Figure S1. The XRD pattern of pristine potassium titanate indicates
a layered structure and matches with that reported in the literature
for the K2Ti4O9 phase.33 In comparison to K2Ti4O9, BA titanate and ODA titanate [Figure 2A(b,d), respectively] exhibit increased basal
spacing, indicating the intercalation of the amines in the interlayer.
Though the basal spacing decreases [Figure 2A(c,e)] on heating the amine titanates, the
interlayer spacing is still higher compared to pristine K2Ti4O9, indicating a change in the orientation
of the alkyl chains of the n-alkylamines. HA titanate
also exhibits a similar trend (Figure S1). In contrast, OA titanate and DDA titanate (Supporting Information, Figure S1) exhibit no change in basal
spacing on heating. Though the as-prepared and heated ODA titanate
exhibit red shifts in the UV–visible absorption spectra (Figure 2B) in comparison
to pristine K2Ti4O9, the absorption
maximum is in the near-UV region. In addition, heated ODA titanate
also exhibits strong absorption in the near-infrared (IR) region,
probably because of partial carbon doping.

pristine K2Ti4O9; (b) as-prepared
and (c) heated BA titanate; and (d) as-prepared
and (e) heated ODA titanate. (B) UV–visible absorbance spectra
of as-prepared and heated ODA titanate in comparison with the XRD
pattern of pristine K2Ti4O9.

In the IR spectra, the presence
of broad N–H and weak C–H
stretching vibrations at 3400 and 2850–2950 cm–1, respectively (Figure S2), in the as-prepared
and heat-treated amine titanates further confirms the presence of n-alkylamines in the interlayer of the titanates before
and after heating (Supporting Information, Figure S2).

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
(Figure 3a,b) of the
as-prepared and
heated ODA titanate reveal that both the samples are made up of bundles
of rectangular rods of lengths in the range of 10–20 μm
and, in addition, point to the fact that heat treatment does not affect
the morphology of the amine titanates.

Figure 3 SEM images of the as-prepared
(a) and heated (b) ODA titanate.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-prepared
and heated ODA titanate is shown in Figure 4. In the case of the as-prepared ODA titanate,
the Ti core-level spectrum (Figure 4a) indicates the presence of Ti–N at 454.6 eV
(Ti3+) and Ti–O at 457.95 eV (Ti4+).
The N 1s core-level spectrum (Figure 4b) further supports the existence of Ti–N with
a peak at 395.7 eV. The intercalated amine exists both as free amine
and as an alkyl ammonium ion. The Ti core-level spectrum (Figure 4c) of the heat-treated
ODA titanate indicates the presence of only Ti–O at 458.5 eV,
and the N 1s core-level spectrum (Figure 4d) indicates the presence of only free amine.
The peak due to Ti–N at 394.3 eV (Figure 4d) is attributed to substitutional β-N
(N3–), indicating that the titanate layers are doped
with nitrogen.21

Figure 4 XPS spectra showing Ti
3p (a,c) and N 1s (b,d) core-level peak
regions of the as-prepared and heated ODA titanate, respectively.

The photocatalytic activity of
the amine titanates toward degradation
of aqueous methylene blue (MB) under ultraviolet irradiation was monitored
by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The efficiencies of
the as-prepared amine titanates (Table 1) are similar to each other and to that of K2Ti4O9. All these samples show poorer efficiency
compared to commercial Degussa P25. However, the heat-treated amine
titanates show improved activity, and the photocatalytic efficiency
increases steadily with increase in the chain length of the intercalated
alkylamine. Heat-treated long chain amine titanates (OA, DDA, or ODA
titanate) degrade the dye much faster compared to heat-treated short-chain
amine titanates (BA or HA titanate). This could possibly be because
of better surface access due to larger separation between the layers.
Alkylamine facilitates nitrogen doping on heating the titanate layers,
as indicated by the XPS analysis (Figure 4). Improved photocatalytic behavior of heat-treated
amine titanates when compared to pristine K2Ti4O9 and Degussa P25 is also due to the efficient charge
separation induced by the doped nitrogen in the titanate layers.21 In comparison to what has so far been reported
in the literature (Table 2), the enhanced activity makes heated ODA titanate a superior
photocatalyst.

Nitrogen doping seems to
be crucial to improve the photocatalytic
activity. Doped nitrogen content is expected to increase with increase
in temperature.21 Thus, the structural
evolution and photocatalytic activity of ODA titanate heated at various
temperatures were studied. Figure 5A indicates that heating ODA titanate beyond 100 °C
causes partial deintercalation of ODA and heating beyond 200 °C
results in near complete deintercalation, resulting in decreased surface
area, as observed in calcined N-doped TiO2.21,23,44

Figure 5 XRD patterns (A) and photocatalytic activity
(B) of ODA titanate
heated at various temperatures.

In tune with the level of deintercalation, the catalytic
activity
decreases, and heating beyond 400 °C makes the catalyst less
effective (Figure 5B) compared to Degussa P25. If nitrogen doping is the only criterion
that controls the activity, then all the heated amine titanates should
exhibit similar activity, but this is not the case. The interlayer
spacing, which increases the access to the catalyst surface, also
seems to play a major role.

If the interlayer spacing is the
major cause for catalytic activity,
then as-prepared amine titanates should show good activity. However,
all the as-prepared amine titanates show very poor catalytic activity—poorer
than even the parent K2Ti4O9. This
counterintuitive result could be due to poor wetting of the as-prepared
amine titanates. In fact, it was observed that these materials tend
to float in the reaction mixture, suggesting poor wettability. To
ascertain the effect of interlayer spacing and to gauge the contribution
from nitrogen doping alone, the dye degradation studies were carried
out in 1-butanol in which the as-prepared amine titanates is shown
to be solvated better. As-prepared and heat-treated ODA titanates
degrade the dye completely in 60 and 45 min, respectively (Table 1). These observations
suggest that the major cause for improved catalytic behavior of amine
titanates is the increased interlayer spacing. Heat treatment leading
to nitrogen doping further improves the catalytic activity.

Catalytic performance of the heat-treated ODA titanate in the degradation
of aqueous MB is summarized in Figure 6a–c. The UV–visible spectrum of MB shows
strong absorption at 665 nm (Figure 6a) and decreases with time and disappears within 25
min in the presence of the heat-treated ODA titanate photocatalyst
under UV radiation. The log (absorbance) versus time plot (Figure 6b) is linear (R2 = 0.999), suggesting pseudo-first order kinetics.
The calculated rate constant from the kinetic plot is 2.3 × 10–3 s–1. The catalytic activity of
ODA titanate starts decreasing after four cycles (Figure 6c), probably because of decrease
in surface access as a consequence of partial deintercalation of the
alkylamine (Supporting Information, Figure
S3).

spectra of the reaction mixture containing 15 mg of the heated ODA
titanate. (a) Evolution of absorption spectra with time, (b) plot

3 Conclusions
Nitrogen-doped
layered titanates could be synthesized on heating n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates at 110 °C. In comparison
to commercial Degussa, these modified titanates exhibit enhanced photocatalytic
activity toward MB degradation under UV irradiation. The enhanced
activity is attributed to the interplay between (i) increased surface
access as the titanate layers are well separated, pillared by the
alkylamine chains, and (ii) nitrogen doping. The results suggest that
alkylamine-intercalated layered titanates could be potential photocatalysts
for environmental amelioration and open new avenues to explore other
propped-up 2D layers as catalysts.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of n-Alkylamine-Intercalated
Titanate (Amine–Titanate)
A series of n-alkylamine (BA, HA, OA, DDA, and ODA)-intercalated layered titanates
were prepared as reported in our earlier work.33 Aqueous solution of the n-alkylamine was
adjusted to pH ≈ 7 using dilute HCl (2 N). K2Ti4O9 (0.350 g) was soaked in 100 mL of the freshly
prepared n-alkylamine solution for 7 days. The amine
titanate product was washed thoroughly with an ethanol–water
mixture (1:1) and dried at room temperature. A part of the amine titanate
was heated at 110 °C for 2 h in air.

4.2 Photocatalytic
Degradation of MB
Photocatalytic activity was studied using
the as-prepared and heat-treated
amine titanate samples as catalysts. MB solution (10 ppm, 100 mL)
was used for the catalytic studies. In each case, 15 mg of the catalyst
was added to the dye solution, and the mixture was stirred in dark
for ∼45 min to equilibrate adsorption/desorption. The solution
with the catalyst was then exposed to ultraviolet (70 W UV lamp) rays.
The progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance
of the dye at 665 nm.

4.3 Characterization
All the solid samples
synthesized were characterized by powder XRD using a PANalytical X’pert
Pro diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, secondary graphite monochromator,
scanning rate of 1° 2θ/min). IR spectra of the samples
were recorded using a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer, Spectrum TWO,
UATR TWO. SEM analysis of the hybrid wafers was carried out using
a Zeiss Ultra 55 field emission scanning electron microscope. UV–visible
spectra of the reaction mixtures were recorded on a PerkinElmer (LS
35) UV–visible spectrometer. XPS measurements were carried
out with Kratos Axis Ultra DLD. All spectra were calibrated to the
binding energy of the C 1s peak at 285 eV.
