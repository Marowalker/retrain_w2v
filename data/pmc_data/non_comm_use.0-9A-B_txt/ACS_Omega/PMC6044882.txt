Herein,
we report the surface functionality of dicationic cysteamine
conjugated cholic acid (DCaC), dicationic cysteamine conjugated deoxycholic
acid (DCaDC), and dicationic cysteamine conjugated lithocholic acid
(DCaLC) templated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on mammalian cells. The
haemocompatibility of the synthesized NPs was evaluated by in vitro
hemolysis and erythrocyte sedimentation rate using human red blood
cells (RBCs). In all of the systems, no toxicity was observed on human
erythrocytes (RBCs) up to the concentration of 120 μg/mL. The
anticancer activity of these dicationic amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs
on A549 lung cancer cells was demonstrated by in vitro cell viability
assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species estimation by DCFH-DA,
apoptosis analysis using AO-EtBr fluorescence staining, DNA fragmentation
analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, and western blot analysis
of caspase-3 expression. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity
of AuNPs to A549 cells increase with the dose and hydrophobicity of
amphiphiles and were found to be in the order: DCaLC-AuNPs > DCaDC-AuNPs
> DCaC-AuNPs.

Introduction
In recent years, gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been used as promising
key materials for biomedical applications such as cell labeling, imaging,
biosensing, gene and drug delivery owing to their unique structure,
tunable optical properties, chemical inertness, and biocompatibility.1−3 Considering the biological perspective, efforts have been devoted
to develop an environmentally benign synthetic approach using a clean,
eco-friendly reducing and capping agent and an environmentally suitable
solvent system for the preparation of AuNPs.4,5 Recent
studies have shown that the size, shape, surface charge, and functionality
of NPs play a significant role in determining the intracellular uptake
and localization of the NPs as well as their biological functions.6,7 In particular, the surface charge of the nanomaterials plays a crucial
role in determining the molecular interactions, cellular uptake, and
cytotoxicity of NPs with biological systems.8 In addition to charge, NP surface functionality has been involved
in the process of cellular uptake and eliciting cellular responses.9,10 For instance, Stellacci et al. have reported the effect of surface
properties of NPs on the negatively charged cell membrane.10b Recently, the Rotello group have demonstrated
the behavior of AuNPs with different hydrophobicities and the effect
of surface functionality on hemolysis.11,12 They observed
linear hemolytic behavior with increasing hydrophobicity in the absence
of serum media. The evaluation of different surface-charged AuNPs
with cell lines was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner.13,14 These findings illustrated that the positively charged AuNPs were
more internalized by cells than neutral or negatively charged NPs.

Cancer is a major terrible threat to public health and has the
highest mortality rates worldwide. Conventionally practiced therapy
with cytotoxic drugs fails to cure most cancer patients with advanced
disease due to the presence or development of resistance to anticancer
agents.15,16 There is growing evidence that targeting
multiple cell death pathways may be an advantageous strategy for the
treatment of cancer.17,18 Nanomaterials are expected to
revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy.19 Several studies have shown that AuNPs serve as carriers for biomolecules
or drugs against some cancer cells.20−23 In addition to this study, AuNPs
can be envisioned as anticancer agents in their own right by generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells.24 Zhao et al. have reported that AuNPs generated more intracellular
ROS in lung cancer cells with low intracellular GSH.25 Hahm et al. and Morgan et al. have reported that at higher
concentrations, ROS often causes cellular damage and leads to cell
death including apoptosis and necrosis.26,27 Moreover,
it is established that hydrophobicity plays an important role in the
generation of ROS, DNA damage, and hence potential genotoxicity.10a Herein, we report haemocompatible and in vitro
anticancer activity against A549 lung cancer cell lines using three
bile acid-based amphiphile-templated AuNPs featuring dicationic head
groups differing in degree of hydrophobicity. The effect of particle
hydrophobicity on cancer cells was analyzed, and the results suggest
that the highly hydrophobic nanoparticles possess high anticancer
properties and induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis by the generation
of ROS.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Dicationic Amphiphile-Stabilized
AuNPs
The bile acid-based dicationic amphiphiles were prepared
by adopting
our previously reported method,28 and the
chemical structure is displayed in Scheme 1. The reaction was demonstrated by mixing
1 × 10–3 M of HAuCl4 ions with optimized
concentrations of dicationic cysteamine conjugated cholic acid (DCaC)
(1 × 10–4 M), dicationic cysteamine conjugated
deoxycholic acid (DCaDC) (2 × 10–4 M), and
dicationic cysteamine conjugated lithocholic acid (DCaLC) (8.3 ×
10–5 M) in aqueous medium at mid acidic pH ranging
from 3.5 to 4.5. The reaction mixture was shaken well and then kept
under bright sunlight irradiation. The formation of AuNPs was monitored
by observing the change in solution color from light yellow to colorless
and finally to pink. The reaction was completed within 90, 180, and
160 min for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized NPs, respectively.
These dicationic amphiphiles stabilized AuNPs show characteristic
surface plasmon resonance around 530 nm (Figure 1) with a stability of more than 6 months.
The size and shape of the NPs were characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements showing that the particles are nearly
spherical in shape with average sizes of 24 ± 2, 25 ± 3,
and 22 ± 3 nm for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized NPs, respectively.
Furthermore, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies provide the
hydrodynamic radii of DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized NPs and
were measured to be 47.12, 44.43, and 45.58 nm, respectively (Figure 1d). The existence
of positive charges on the NP surface was confirmed by zeta potential
measurements and was found to be +20.30, +31.54, and +25.29 mV for
DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs respectively (Figure 1e). The size, surface charge,
and contact angle28 measurements of synthesized
NPs are compared in Table S1. The synthesized
AuNPs were purified by high speed centrifuge (Lark innovative fine
teknowledge, India) at 24 000 rpm maintained at 4 °C for
30 min to remove free amphiphiles. After centrifugation, AuNPs pellets
were resuspended in deionized water and centrifuged thrice in the
same manner to ensure complete removal of extraneous matter. Finally,
the purified Au colloidal dispersion was collected, lyophilized, and
stored for further characterization.5b The
concentrations of the three dicationic amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs
were calculated by adopting the previously reported protocol,29 and the values were found to be 3.72, 3.30,
and 4.82 nM for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs, respectively.

Haemocompatibilty Studies
Erythrocyte Sedimentation
Rate (ESR)
ESR is the traditionally
used standard clinical test to detect the sedimentation rate of erythrocytes
(red blood cells (RBCs)). The sedimentation rate is influenced by
three factors including the surface of the RBCs, plasma concentration,
and size and shape of the RBCs. Under normal condition, the rouleaux
formation of RBCs is low. Upon interaction with AuNPs, not much change
in the ESR was observed indicating that the NPs do not affect the
normal rouleaux formation (Figure 2). The sedimentation rates were measured over a period
of 1 h and found to be 8, 10, and 12 mm for DCaC-AuNPs, DCaDC-AuNPs,
and DCaLC-AuNPs, respectively. The obtained results were within the
normal values of the Westergren method and show preliminary evidence
to support its clinical utility.

In Vitro Haemotoxicity
Analysis
The hemolysis assay
is a procedure routinely used by hospital-based clinical and research
laboratories specializing in complement-related studies.30 Because the toxicity of NPs is highly dependent
on its physicochemical and surface properties, it is essential to
evaluate the blood compatibility of AuNPs for biomedical applications.
The hemolytic assay results showed that all of the tested amphiphile-stabilized
AuNPs exhibit concentration-dependent hemolysis with the very lowest
activity (Figure 3).
At the highest concentration (120 μg/mL), the hemolytic activities
of DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs were found to be 1.90,
1.97, and 2.09%, respectively. According to reports, tested samples
with less than 5% hemolytic activity could be considered haemocompatible.31 In this study, these amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs
had good haemocompatibility up to the concentration of 120 μg/mL.
The light microscopy observations of RBCs treated with dicationic
amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs further supports the results of haemocompatibility
(Figure 4). As more
than 90% of the erythrocytes retained their original oval shape without
any aggregation, they could be used for future biological and biomedical
applications.

In Vitro Anticancer Activity
of Dicationic Amphiphile-Stabilized
AuNPs against A549 Human Lung Cancer Cell Line
Cytotoxicity
studies of NPs depend on particle size, shape, composition, surface
charge, and hydrophobicity. Although correlation of cytotoxic effect
and size of NPs has been studied extensively,32−36 a limited number of reports are available for the
effect of surface charge and hydrophobicity.14,37,38 In this study, the anticancer activity of
the synthesized AuNPs was investigated against A549 human lung cancer
cells using the standard MTT cell assay method. The percentage of
cell viability inhibition was calculated at different concentrations
of DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs (20–120 μg/mL)
for 24 h, and the obtained results are displayed in Figure 5. The results show that 3.71
and 24.26% inhibition of cell viability at 20 and 120 μg/mL,
respectively, in DCaC-AuNPs. For DCaDC-AuNPs, the figures were 3.45%
at 20 μg/mL and 43.77% at 120 μg/mL inhibition, respectively.
In the case of DCaLC, the inhibition was found to be 4.43 and 46.89%
at 20 and 120 μg/mL, respectively. Among these, the DCaLC system
showed better inhibitory activity at both the lowest and highest concentrations.
These results suggest that the increased hydrophobicity of amphiphiles
with positively surface-charged NPs show more efficiency in perturbing
the structure or partly digesting cell membranes and interacting with
cellular materials thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation.
Previous reports also show that hydrophobic coated NPs play a significant
role in cell membrane damage than that of the uncoated NPs.39 Rotello et al. demonstrated that increasing
the hydrophobicity on the NP surface resulted in higher cytotoxicity
with concomitant ROS production.40 The
results obtained from MTT assay were further supported by inverted
microscopy analysis (Figure 6). The morphological evaluation of cells treated with DCaDC-AuNPs
and DCaLC-AuNPs (120 μg/mL) for 24 h revealed a decrease in
the proliferation activity, and the actual polygonal morphology of
these cells show membrane damage. The salient morphological features
of apoptosis such as distorted shape, membrane blebbing, and loss
of cell membrane asymmetry, and cell shrinkages are indicated by yellow
doted circles (Figure 6). This provides strong evidence that the cytotoxicity of AuNPs to
A549 cells not only increased in a dose-dependent manner but also
depends on the hydrophobicity of AuNPs. Hence, these AuNPs could be
considered as a vector for drug delivery to treat cancer after detailed
studies in the future.

from 20 to 120 μg/mL. Here, (*) represents a significant difference
(p < 0.05) compared with that of control.

Estimation of Intracellular ROS
ROS is a specific type
of oxygen-containing reactive molecule, playing important roles in
various cellular processes and is known to be essential for cell proliferation
at basal levels. However at sufficiently high concentrations, ROS
could become cytotoxic, often entailing cellular necrosis or apoptosis.41,42 DCFH-DA is a nonfluorescent dye used to measure the intracellular
ROS generation of cells. It can enter the plasma membrane passively,
where it is converted to fluorescent DCFH by the action of peroxides
in the presence of peroxidases.43 To understand
the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs
in A549 cells (Scheme 2), quantitative analysis of ROS was performed by spectrofluorometer
(Figure 7). The generation
of ROS level compared to that of control for DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized
AuNPs follows the increasing order of 1.25, 2.12, and 2.55 fold, respectively.
The obtained results also clearly indicate that the apoptosis of A549
cells induced by the different AuNPs through ROS generation was facilitated
by the increased hydrophobicity of the AuNPs.

concentration of 120 μg/mL.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism of ROS-Induced Cell Apoptosis
Fluorescence Microscopy
Analysis of Cell Death
To determine
the morphological changes of treated cells by the apoptotic effect
of AuNPs, AO-EtBr staining was carried out. After the administration
of 120 μg/mL of NPs for 24 h, the cells stained using AO-EtBr
staining appeared green and yellow or red in color with associated
apoptotic features such as apoptotic bodies and nuclear condensation.
The florescence micrographs of untreated control cells exhibit normal
nuclear architecture with uniform green fluorescence. After treatment
with DCaC-AuNPs, early apoptotic cells with yellow or yellowish green
fluorescence were noted, as indicated by arrows (Figure 8b). This is also supported
by the MTT assay performed on DCaC-AuNP treated A549 cells, which
showed a high percentage of cell viability. However, in the cases
of DCaDC- and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs (Figure 8c,d), considerable cell death was observed,
and it was clearly evidenced from the greenish yellow and yellow orange
fluorescence of the dead cells. Our results corroborate a similar
observation reported in previous studies showing that the hydrophobicity
and surface charge of NPs can influence the capacity to produce ROS.44 Recently, Rotello et al. have reported the role
of surface functionality of cationic AuNPs on acute cytotoxicity,
ROS generation, and DNA damage.10 From
the results obtained from this study and previous reports, it is clear
that the surface functionality of NPs favors cytotoxicity through
NP internalization. In particular, hydrophobicity of the NP surface
is as important as surface charge in dictating cytotoxicity.

DNA Fragmentation
Because DNA shearing and fragmentation
is considered to be the hallmark of apoptosis, the occurrence of apoptosis
was determined by two factors, reduced and shrunken cells and DNA
fragmentation.45Figure 9 shows the agarose gel electrophoresis of
nuclear DNA from the control and dicationic amphiphile-templated AuNP
treated A549 cells. It is observed that in lane 3, the isolated DNA
from DCaC-treated cells shows no significant DNA damage. However,
isolated DNA from DCaDC-AuNPs (lane 4) and DCaLC-AuNPs (lane 5) were
sheared significantly. In particular, lane 5 shows well sheared and
fragmented DNA. The results obtained from this study further supports
the notion that the dicationic amphiphile-templated AuNPs induces
apoptosis through increased hydrophobicity as compared with untreated
cell DNA (lane 2).

Western Blot Assay
Previous studies have demonstrated
that the caspase-3 cascade activation is responsible for several apoptotic
mechanisms through induction of the cell cycle phase, genomic profile,
and so on. Thus, it is obvious that DNA fragmentation and caspase-3
activation mediate the apoptotic process initiated either through
the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway by the toxicants.45,46 In the present study, the caspase-3 production in DCaC-, DCaDC-,
and DCaLC-AuNPs induced in apoptotic cells was examined using Western
blot analysis and densitometry showing that the magnitude of caspase-3
production in DCaC, DCaDC, and DCaLC increased one, two, and three
fold, respectively (Figure 10).

Statistical Methods
All of the data were analyzed using
SPSS/10.0 software, and data were analyzed with one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc Tukey test. The difference
was considered statistically significant at p ≤
0.05. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the surface hydrophobicity
of dicationic amphiphiles plays a prominent role in the intracellular
uptake of AuNPs. The NPs showed good haemocompatibility up to the
concentration of 120 μg/mL and anticancer activity against A549
human lung cancer cells, evaluated using the standard MTT assay. Among
these, DCaLC-AuNPs showed better inhibitory activity at both the lowest
and highest concentrations. The ROS generation in DCaLC-stabilized
AuNPs showed a 2.55 fold increase when compared with that of control.
The effect of particle hydrophobicity on cancer cells was analyzed,
it was observed that the NPs with greater hydrophobicity possess high
anticancer properties and induce caspase-3-mediated apoptosis by the
generation of ROS. These results suggest that the degree of surface
hydrophobicity of the synthesized NPs causes severe toxicity with
respect to ROS generation. Hence, these AuNPs with good haemocompatibility
and anticancer properties could be used effectively for cancer therapeutics
in biomedical applications.

materials and solvents were used as received from the suppliers with
no further purification. The glass containers were washed with aqua-regia
(HCl/HNO3, 3:1, v/v) and then rinsed with double distilled
water.

High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-TEM)
HR-TEM images were recorded with a JEOL JEM 2100 equipped with
a Gatan imaging filter. The HR-TEM analysis was conducted by placing
a drop of the nanoparticle solution on a carbon-coated copper grid
and followed by solvent evaporation under ambient temperature. The
average size of the nanoparticles was analyzed using imagej software.

DLS and Zeta Potential Measurements
The DLS and zeta
potential of amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs were measured in aqueous
medium using a Malvern zetasizer nano ZS system.

Contact Angle
Measurements
For contact angle measurements,
a good-quality glass plate was selected and diced to specific sizes
(25 mm × 25 mm). The glass slide was cleaned using piranha solution
(3:1 mixture of H2SO4 and H2O2) and subsequently dried using nitrogen gas. The same protocol
was repeated for each surfactant, and all of the surfactant solutions
were prepared freshly before the experiments. Contact angle measurements
(θ) were carried out via the dynamic sessile drop method using
a surface tensiometer, Data Physics (DCAT 11EC), equipped with a Hamilton
Syringe. Liquid droplets (4 μL) were used in each measurement.

Blood Sample Collection
A healthy donor was selected
for blood sample collection. Before blood collection, the donor was
screened for basic eligibility for blood donation using factors like
anemia, age, weight, drunken, state, drugs, surgery, and so on. The
blood sample was collected from the vein and gently mixed with the
appropriate volume of anticoagulant and stored at 4 °C for further
analysis.

Estimation of ESR
ESR measures the rate of sedimentation
of RBCs under standard conditions, wherein the drastic changes in
sedimentation rate are indicative of disease progression. According
to the Westerngren method, the normal value should be 15 mm/h.47 The amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs were separately
added to the collected blood sample at a concentration of 120 μg/mL,
then the blood samples were loaded into the Westergren tubes upto
the mark around zero, and the untreated blood sample was considered
as a control. All of the tubes were vertically allowed to stand for
1 h without any disturbance. The ESR rate was measured every 15 min,
and the obtained results were recorded.

In Vitro Hemolytic (Erythrocyte)
Toxicity Analysis
The in vitro hemolytic toxicity of DCaC-,
DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized
AuNPs were studied by measuring the percentage of hemoglobin released
from the human erythrocytes by adopting the previously reported protocol
with a slight modification.48 Collected
blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min in a cooling
centrifuge. The supernatant plasma and buffy coat were carefully removed,
and the pellet erythrocytes were gently washed three times with a
sterile saline solution. Erythrocyte suspension (5%) was prepared
with a saline solution, and 1 mL of the suspension was added to each
tube containing 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 μg of the DCaC-,
DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs. Negative and positive controls
were also prepared by 1 mL of cell suspension (blank) and the cell
suspension containing Triton X-100 (1%), respectively. All of the
tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and were centrifuged at
2000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was collected in separate
tubes to measure the optical density values at 540 nm against the
blank by using an UV–visible spectrophotometer. The percentage
of hemolysis was calculated using the following formula.  The calculated percentages
of hemolysis for
all of the samples were compared to those of the ASTM standard,49 that is, highly haemocompatible (<5% hemolysis),
haemocompatible (within 10% hemolysis), and nonhaemocompatible (>20%
hemolysis). Erythrocyte morphology was analyzed at the highest concentration
(120 μg/mL) of the NP-interacted cell suspension. Cells were
prepared at a ratio of 1:9 of cells and saline solution and examined
under the low-power objective (10×) of the optical microscope
(Olympus CH20i) with the system-attached Celestron camera (2 MP).

Culture of A549 Lung Cancer Cell Line
The human lung
cancer cell line, A549, was procured from the National Center for
Cell Science, Pune, India, and the cells were maintained in Ham’s
F12 K medium. The media was supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
FBS, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 50
μg/mL amphotericin B. The cells were cultured in a T25 flask
with 3 mL of medium and kept in an incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere. After attaining
confluence (about 75%), these cells were subcultured once in 3 days
and also observed for multiplication patterns and contamination under
an inverted microscope (Motic AE31, Hong Kong). The cells in the exponential
growth phase were used for all of the experiments.

Cell Counting
The cells were trypsinized and neutralized
with complete medium. The trypan blue mixed cell suspension (1:1 ratio)
was loaded in a haemocytometer, and the cells were counted with the
help of a low-power objective (10×) in an optical microscope.
The total number of cells per milliliter (mL) was calculated using
the following formula.  

Anticancer
Activity of AuNPs against A549 Human Lung Cancer
Cell Line
Anticancer activity of dicationic amphiphile-stabilized
AuNPs against the lung cancer cell line was analyzed using the standard
MTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)
assay, in which MTT was cleaved by mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes
of viable cells and yielded purple-colored formazan crystals, which
were solubilized using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).50 A549 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells in each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
The cell culture medium was replaced from each well by adding 100
μL of fresh medium. Different concentrations of DCaC-, DCaDC-,
and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 μg/mL)
were added into the respective wells, and the cells without NPs were
considered as a control. The cells were incubated for 24 h in a 5%
CO2 incubator at 37 °C. MTT solution was freshly prepared
(5 mg/mL PBS), and 10 μL was added into each well including
control and incubated for 3 h under the above-said conditions. After
that, the supernatant was carefully removed, and 100 μL of DMSO
was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Cytotoxicity was measured
by recording the absorbance of the formed formazan purple color in
an ELIZA reader (BIO-TEK, Powerwave-XS) at 570 nm. Cell viability
(%) and cell inhibition (%) were calculated by using the following
formula    Cell morphology of control and NP treated
cells were analyzed using an inverted micrcoscope (Motic AE31, Hong
Kong).

AO-EtBr Staining
AO-EtBr is used to stain apoptotic
cells. AO is permeable through the intact cell membrane and stained
both live and dead cells, EtBr can pass only through the damaged cell
membrane (lost membrane integrity). Apoptosis analysis was followed
by adopting the previously reported protocol with a slight modification.51 The cells were seeded in a six-well plate on
a sterile cover slip at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells with 3 mL of Ham’s F12K complete medium, and the cells
were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. After
the attainment of >80% confluence, the cells were treated with
120
μg/mL of DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs, and the
untreated cells were considered as control. These cells were allowed
to incubate for 24 h and fixed on a cover slip and stained with AO-EtBr.
The coverslip containing stained cells were placed on a clean glass
slide at an inverted position and examined by a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon ECLIPSE 80i) using fluorescein filter (450–490 nm).

Estimation of ROS by DCFH-DA
The intracellular ROS
generation of cells can be investigated using the dichlorofluorescein-diacetate
(DCFH-DA) as a well-established compound to detect intracellularly
produced H2O2. Estimation of ROS by DCFH-DA
is followed by adopting the previously reported protocol with a slight
modification.52 The cells (1 × 105) were seeded in a six-well plate and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator maintained at 37 °C. After confluence, the
cells were treated with DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-stabilized AuNPs
at a concentration of 120 μg/mL, and untreated cells were considered
as control. After 24 h incubation, the medium was removed, and the
cells were stained with DCFH-DA (20 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C
and subsequently washed with PBS and collected in a sterile centrifuge
tube. The ROS was analyzed from each sample using a Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon).

DNA Fragmentation Assay
DNA fragmentation
assay was
performed by adopting the previously reported protocol with a slight
modification.45 Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a T75 flask with Ham F-12 kaighn’s
modification medium containing 10% FBS and kept in an incubator for
24 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After attaining confluence
(about 80%), the cells were treated with a 120 μg/mL concentration
of DCaC-, DCaDC-, and DCaLC-AuNPs for 24 h under the above-said conditions,
and the cells without NPs were considered as a control. After 24 h,
the cells were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4).
The genomic DNA was isolated from treated and control cells. DNA (20
μg) was electrophoresed in 1.2% agrose gel containing EtBr in
a gel tank with TAE buffer (pH 8) for 45 min at 100 V, and the gel
was analyzed under the UV transilluminator.

Western Blot Analysis
The protein was isolated from
the control and AuNP treated cells using cell lysis buffer and quantified.
Protein (40 μg) was mixed with an equal volume of 1× SDS
sample buffer (0.2 M Tris–HCl buffer, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS,
0.02% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min in a water bath.
After cooling, the samples were loaded in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS PAGE) containing 5% stacking gel and 10% resolved gel. The resolved
gel protein was transferred to the poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)
membrane by electrophoresis. The membrane was blocked with PBS containing
0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA at RT and then probed with primary antibody
β-actin (1:500 dilution), Caspase 3 (1:500 dilution), and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with PBST (thrice),
subsequently the HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution)
was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After that, it was washed with
PBS, and the protein antibody complexes were visualized using DAB
as a chromogenic substrate. Relative protein levels normalized to β-actin
were quantified using Image-J software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD).
