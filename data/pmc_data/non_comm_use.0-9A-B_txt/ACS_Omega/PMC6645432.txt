Uniform and dense perovskite films
were realized by the one-step
solution-processing method combined with toluene washing. The influence
of the delay time applied for toluene washing on the film quality
of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)
was investigated in a comprehensive manner. The optimal delay time
was experimentally observed at the critical point when the color of
the film changes from transparent to hazy. A detailed X-ray diffraction
study suggested that such a color change was caused by the emergence
of the MAPbI3 crystal nucleus. This finding provides a
convenient method to determine the optimal time accurately. With the
optimal delay time, the most uniformly distributed MAPbI3 grains with the largest average grain size and the smoothest surface
were obtained. Owing to the realization of homogeneous MAPbI3 films combined with full coverage of perovskite on the substrate
achieved by toluene washing at the critical point, open-circuit voltage,
short-circuit current, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency
of 1.11 V, 18.24 mA/cm2, 77.47, and 15.54% were obtained.

Introduction
Organometal halide
perovskite solar cells (PSC) are settled as
the most attractive topic in photovoltaic research area owing to its
simple device fabrication technology and high power conversion efficiency
(PCE).1,2 The highly efficient PSC benefited from
the excellent properties of the perovskite light absorber, such as
high light-absorption coefficient, high charge-carrier mobility, and
appropriate direct bandgap.3,4 Since the first PSC
with a PCE of 3.8% was reported by Miyasaka’s group in 2009,5 huge promotion has been achieved with a PCE exceeding
20%, which is close to the PCE of Si solar cells.6−8 These exhibited
the feasibility of PSCs for commercial applications.

The film
quality of the perovskite light-absorbing layer plays
a crucial role in realizing highly efficient PSCs.9 During the past 8 years, technologies of vacuum thermal
evaporation10 and solution processing11,12 have been developed to deposit perovskite films. Compared with the
two-step sequential deposition process, the one-step solution method
is simpler and takes shorter time.13 However,
one-step solution-processed perovskite films generally demonstrate
inhomogeneous surface morphology, irregular crystallinity, and poor
reproducibility.14−16 To improve the film quality, the solvent washing
method was developed, which has been proven to be effective in assisting
the formation of uniform and dense perovskite films.17,18 Among the antisolvents for washing, toluene and chlorobenzene were
commonly used.17−21 Except for the type of the solvent, the process conditions of solvent
washing also play an important role in determining the film quality,
such as the amount of solvent18 and the delay time from the beginning of perovskite
solution spinning.20 Xiao et al.20 optimized the delay time of chlorobenzene washing
during the spin coating of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution, which was 6 s. However, as well-known, the optimal
delay time for adding an antisolvent was usually different if the
fabrication conditions changed, such as, the recipe of perovskite
precursor solution and even the atmosphere around the spin coater.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the correlation between the
optimal delay time and the morphology change of the perovskite film.
In our manuscript, after elaborative investigation on the optimization
of the delay time, we found a method to decide the optimal delay time
simply by visual inspection, that is, the critical point when the
color of the film starts to change from transparent to hazy. Hence,
the optimal delay time can be adjusted conveniently and accurately.

In this work, perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) films with uniform grain size distribution and
smooth surface were realized by well-controlled delay time of solvent
washing. Toluene washing was selected as an example because of its
frequent use in the solvent washing method. The influences of delay
time of solvent washing on the film morphology and device performance
were studied in detail. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images revealed the influence of delay time
on the grain size distribution and surface morphology of MAPbI3 films. The proper delay time had been proven to be the critical
point when the film started to turn hazy owing to the emergence of
MAPbI3 crystal nucleus. Therefore, the optimal delay time
of toluene washing can be visually determined from the color change
of MAPbI3 films. The realization of homogeneous MAPbI3 films together with the greatly improved coverage on the
substrate by toluene washing at optimal delay time led to the increase
of open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit
current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE
of the device from 0.61 ± 0.04 V, 5.3 ± 0.2 mA/cm2, 38.7 ± 0.6%, and 1.2 ± 0.1% of unwashed device to 0.90
± 0.02 V, 19.7 ± 0.9 mA/cm2, 68 ± 2%, and
12.1 ± 0.8%, respectively. To emphasize on the mechanism of the
optimization of delay time of toluene washing, a basic device structure
(without adding extra interlayer for improved carrier transport) was
used although it displayed a moderate PCE of the solar cell. By applying
this toluene washing method on the NiOx-based PSC with the device structure of ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PCBM)/Ag, a VOC of 1.1 V, JSC of 18.24 mA/cm2, FF of 77.47%,
and PCE of 15.54% were obtained.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
the schematic diagram of the cell architecture and the corresponding
energy levels, as well as the deposition processes of the MAPbI3 film by means of spin coating. The inverted PSC had a structure
of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)
(PEDOT:PSS) (15 nm)/MAPbI3 (380 nm)/PCBM (50 nm)/Ag (70
nm).

and (c) solvent engineering procedure for the deposition of MAPbI3 films.

The detailed process
procedures for preparing MAPbI3 films are depicted in Figure 1c. Three steps were
involved: MAPbI3 precursor
solution spinning, toluene washing, and thermal annealing. Step 1,
the MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin coated on PEDOT:PSS
substrate. Step 2, toluene washing was applied during the spinning
of MAPbI3 precursor solution. Three different delay times,
3, 8, and 15 s, from the beginning of MAPbI3 precursor
solution spinning were studied. Step 3, the resulting films were annealed
at 100 °C for 10 min. The pictures taken from the films with
different delay times are shown in Figure 2a–d. We noticed that a delay time
of 8 s was the critical point in our case. Longer than 8 s, the film
starts to turn hazy during the spinning, which can be observed visually.
Transparent films were formed immediately after toluene washing at
delay times of 3 and 8 s (Figure 2b). A similar phenomenon has been observed when toluene
washing was applied on the spinning of a mixture of PbBr2, PbI2, MABr, methyl ammonium iodide (MAI), γ-butyrolactone,
and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).17 However, in
the case of toluene washing at 15 s, similar to that without toluene
washing treatment, the film did not become transparent any more; the
resulting film was brown (Figure 2c). The color of all films turned to dark brown after
thermal annealing (Figure 2d).

(XRD) patterns of the films with toluene washing at 8 s before (in
black) and after (in red) thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10
min.

To understand the color change
of the film caused by toluene washing
during spin coating, XRD was carried out on the films with toluene
washing at 8 s before and after thermal annealing, as shown in Figure 2e. Before thermal
annealing, XRD peaks located at 6.74°, 7.29°, and 9.1°
were observed, which were originated from the intermediate phase of
PbI2–MAI–DMSO, as suggested previously.17,22 Toluene selectively washed the DMF in MAPbI3 precursor
solution and froze the component as an intermediated phase of PbI2–MAI–DMSO complex.17,22 After thermal annealing, the peaks of 6.74°, 7.29°, and
9.1° all disappeared, whereas the intensity of the peak at 14.1°
increased greatly, which can be designated to the (110) diffraction
of MAPbI3. This indicated that the intermediate phase turned
to MAPbI3 completely after the evaporation of DMSO by thermal
annealing.17 It had also been observed
that thermal annealing turned the transparent film to dark brown,
which represented the formation of MAPbI3.23,24

The XRD patterns of the films obtained with toluene washing
at
delay times of 3, 8, and 15 s as well as the film without toluene
washing followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min are shown
in Figure S1. All MAPbI3 films
showed intense diffraction peaks at 14.1° and moderate intensity
at 27°, which can be, respectively, assigned to (110) and (220)
diffractions of the MAPbI3 phase.25 This indicated the preferred growth of grains along the (110) plane.
After toluene washing at 3, 8, and 15 s, the intensities of peaks
at 14.1° and 27° were similar to that of the unwashed MAPbI3 film, illustrating similar crystallinity.

SEM images
of the resulting MAPbI3 films with different
delay times of toluene washing, together with the film without toluene
washing are depicted in Figure 3. Without toluene washing (Figure 3a), a number of bundles of MAPbI3 with a length of over 10 μm were woven together in a network
on the surface of the substrate. Numerous pinholes with irregular
shapes distribute among them, indicating the bad coverage of MAPbI3 on the substrate. With toluene washing at 3 or 8 s, uniform
and dense MAPbI3 films were formed after thermal annealing.
Numerous polygonal grains were observed. In the case of dripping toluene
at 15 s, MAPbI3 had images similar to that without toluene
washing, excepting the relative smaller size of the bundles. Numerous
pinholes were also observed. Therefore, the SEM images revealed that
the morphology of the MAPbI3 film depended on the delay
time of toluene washing.

Figure 3 SEM images of the annealed MAPbI3 films under different
deposition conditions (a) without toluene washing and with toluene
washing at different delay times during the spinning of MAPbI3 precursor solution: (b) 3, (c) 8, and (d) 15 s; insets are
the corresponding SEM images taken at higher magnification.

The dense MAPbI3 film
with uniform grain size can be
obtained simply by toluene washing at appropriate delay time. The
distribution of grain size based on the SEM images was analyzed and
summarized, as shown in Figure S2. The
corresponding average grain sizes of unwashed and washed at 3, 8,
and 15 s films were about 165.52, 158.79, 212.41, and 187.22 nm in
diameter, respectively. This indicated that the average grain sizes
of MAPbI3 increased due to toluene washing. With toluene
washing at the delay time of 8 s, the average size reached the maximum,
indicating the most homogeneous-sized grains. However, with the washing
delay time being further increased to 15 s, the average grain size
decreased and nonuniform MAPbI3 grains were formed.

AFM images shown in Figure 4 demonstrated that surface roughness of the MAPbI3 film depended on the delay time of toluene washing. The root-mean-square
roughness of the MAPbI3 film by toluene washing at 3, 8,
and 15 s were 11.9, 8.73, and 27.6 nm, respectively, confirming that
the MAPbI3 film resulting from toluene washing at 8 s had
the smoothest surface.

Figure 4 AFM height and 3D images of the MAPbI3 film
with toluene
washing at delay times of (a,d) 3 s, (b,e) 8 s, and (c,f) 15 s. The
size of images is 3 μm × 3 μm.

The morphology of MAPbI3 demonstrated by SEM and
AFM
showed that toluene washing led to better film quality. In addition,
with the increase of delay time of toluene washing from 3 to 8 s,
better MAPbI3 morphology was obtained with the increased
crystal size and decreased surface roughness; however, further extending
the delay time led to bad morphology of the MAPbI3 film.
According to the morphology change of MAPbI3, the delay
times of toluene washing can be divided into three stages.20 At the early time of the spin coating of the
MAPbI3 precursor solution, for example, 3 s, the solution
was far from supersaturation. The process was dominated by the removal
of excess solution. Toluene washing at this stage was not so effective
in regard to the formation of the intermediate phase. The grain sizes
of MAPbI3 were small and not so uniformly distributed.
Stage 2, at about 8 s in our case, the solution was more concentrated
and was about to form MAPbI3 crystal nucleus. Toluene washing
at this stage will freeze the components of MAPbI3 precursor
solution and form the intermediate phase. Therefore, the MAPbI3 film had a uniform grain size. This stage can be determined
by naked eyes since the film started to become hazy owing to the formation
of MAPbI3 crystal nucleus.20 Stage three, at about 15 s, the film had already became hazy before
toluene washing, indicating the existence of MAPbI3 crystal
nucleus. The intermediate phase formed after toluene washing coexisted
with MAPbI3 crystal at this stage of toluene washing after
15 s. Therefore, the morphology of MAPbI3 was similar to
that without toluene washing.

PSCs with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag
based on MAPbI3 films deposited with or without toluene
washing were fabricated and measured. The current density–voltage
(J–V) curves are shown in Figure 5, and the detailed
performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device without toluene washing had
a VOC of 0.61 ± 0.04 V, JSC of 5.3 ± 0.2 mA/cm2, FF of 38.7 ±
0.6%, and PCE of 1.2 ± 0.1%. After toluene washing, the device
performances were improved with the increasing delay time from 3 to
8 s. That is to say, the optimal device was fabricated with toluene
washing at the delay time of 8 s. It has a VOC of 0.90 ± 0.02 V, JSC of
19.7 ± 0.9 mA/cm2, FF of 68 ± 2%, and PCE of
12.1 ± 0.8%. The increase of JSC was
further proven by the corresponding IPCE data, as shown in Figure S3. The integrated JSC values for devices without or with toluene washing (at 8
s) were 4.3 and 18 mA/cm2, respectively. The moderate PCE
of the optimal solar cell was attributed to the basic device configuration
that was used. To further increase the PCE of the device, we fabricated
the device with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag. The MAPbI3 film was deposited
with toluene washing at 8 s, when the films became hazy. A VOC of 1.1 V, JSC of 18.24 mA/cm2, FF of 77.47%, and PCE of 15.54% were
obtained (Figure S4). We also applied this
toluene washing method to n–i–p planar solar cells with
the device configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 (50 nm)/MAPbI3 (380 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (100 nm)/Ag
(70 nm). A VOC of 1.08 V, JSC of 23.3 mA/cm2, FF of 57.67%, and PCE of
14.49% were obtained by controlling the washing delay time at the
point when the film color started to turn hazy. The corresponding J–V curve is shown in Figure S5.

The performance enhancement
of solar cells by toluene washing was
attributed to the homogeneous MAPbI3 grains, smooth surface,
and improved coverage of MAPbI3 films on the substrate.
Uniform and dense MAPbI3 films could benefit the charge
transfer and depress the leakage current of devices. The dark current
density–voltage plots in Figure 5b demonstrated that after washing at 8 s, the leakage
current decreased significantly. The decrease of the surface roughness
of the MAPbI3 film will improve its contact with the following
PCBM layer and therefore enhance the collection of electrons.26 As a result, all performance parameters were
increased greatly. The J–V curves of 8 s in the reverse and forward scan direction well-overlapped
to each other with only a slightly difference of FF and PCE, indicating
there was no hysteresis effect. In addition, totally 72 devices with
toluene washing at 8 s were fabricated from several batches, and the
statics results of VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are shown in Figure S6. It demonstrated that after toluene washing at optimal delay
time, PSCs show good reproducibility.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the morphology of MAPbI3 was controlled
by toluene washing during the spinning of MAPbI3 precursor
solution. Uniform and dense MAPbI3 films with improved
coverage on the substrate were obtained after thermal annealing. The
grain size distribution and surface roughness of MAPbI3 films depended on the delay time of toluene washing. The optimal
delay time of 8 s was the critical point, which can be determined
by visually observing the color change of MAPbI3 films.
XRD, SEM, and AFM results showed that the crystal nucleus started
to form at the critical point. With optimal toluene washing, a VOC of 1.1 V, JSC of 18.24 mA/cm2, FF of 77.47%, and PCE of 15.54% were
obtained.

Methods
MAI Synthesis and Solution Preparation
MAI was synthesized
in our lab. Methylamine solution in alcohol (48 mL, 0 °C cooling)
was added into hydroiodic acid (20 mL) and stirred for 3 h. To guarantee
the complete reaction of hydroiodic acid, the amount of methylamine
was excessive. During the reaction process, N2 was continuously
piped to the solution. The blended solution appeared pale yellow in
color when the reaction was completed. By evaporating the solvents
at 60 °C for 1 h with a rotary evaporator, the precipitated yellow-white
crystal was collected. The products were purified with anhydrous diethyl
ether and collected with a suction filter. Finally, the product, MAI,
was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h. CH3NH3PbI3 solution (40 wt %) was prepared by
adding the MAI powder, PbI2, and DMSO at a mole ratio of
1:1:1 in DMF and stirred for 1 h.

Methylamine, hydroiodic acid,
DMSO, and DMF were all purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received.

Preparation of NiOx Nanoparticles
and NiOx Films
First, 12.885
g of NiCl2·6H2O was dissolved in 100 mL
of deionized water under magnetic stirring. Then, 10 M NaOH solution
was added into the solution drop by drop until the pH value reached
10. A turbid green solution was obtained and centrifuged. After being
washed twice with deionized water, the obtained precipitation was
dried at 80 °C overnight and then annealed at 270 °C for
2 h. NiOx nanoparticles (10 mg) were added
into 1 mL of deionized water and then treated by ultrasound for 8
h. Finally, NiOx films were deposited
on ITO-coated glass substrates by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30
s and then baked at 130 °C for 10 min in air.

Device Fabrication
and Measurements
For PEDOT:PSS (P4083,
Bayer)-based PSC devices, PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto precleaned
ITO-coated glass at 4000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 150 °C for
15 min. Following, a solution of PbI2/MAI/DMSO = 1:1:1
in DMF was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 10 s and then 6000 rpm for
20 s. Toluene (400 μL) was added dropwise during the spinning
of MAPbI3 precursor solution. The delay times from the
beginning of the spinning were changed from 3 s to 8 s to 15 s. Then,
the sample was heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. After
that, PCBM solution in dichlorobenzene (40 mg/mL) was spin coated
on top of the MAPbI3 layer at 1000 rpm for 20 s and then
6000 rpm for 20 s. Then, the sample was annealed at 70 °C for
1 h. Finally, Ag was evaporated as the top electrode in a vacuum chamber.

The NiOx-based PSC device with the
structure of ITO/NiOx (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (380 nm)/PCBM (50 nm)/BCP (1 nm)/Ag
(70 nm) was fabricated by sequentially depositing perovskite precursor
solution, PCBM, BCP, and Ag. The method was the same as mentioned
above.

The n–i–p-type PSC used here was fabricated
with
a structure of FTO/TiO2 (50 nm)/MAPbI3 (380
nm)/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD, 100 nm)/Ag (70 nm). The TiO2 precursor solution
was prepared by adding 369 μL of titanium isopropoxide (99.9%,
Aldrich) in a mixed solvent of 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol and 35 μL
of 2 M HCl. After spin coating TiO2 precursor solution
at 2000 rpm for 30 s, a 50 nm thickness compact TiO2 film
was formed on the FTO-coated glass substrate. Then, the sample was
heated at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film was deposited
as mentioned above. Following, the spiro-OMeTAD solution (60 mM/mL
in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at
4000 rpm for 20 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding
30 mM LiTFSI (lithium triflimide, from a stock solution in acetonitrile)
and 200 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 1 mL spiro-OMeTAD
solution (60 mM/mL in chlorobenzene). Spiro-OMeTAD and TBP were purchased
from Borun New Material Technology Co., Ltd. and used as received.
LiTFSI and chlorobenzene were purchased from Xi’an Polymer
Light Technology Corp. and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.

The
current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by a Keithley 2602 sourceMeter under
an illumination of 1 sun (100 mW/cm2 AM 1.5G), which is
calibrated with a standard Si photodiode. The device has an area of
0.096 cm2 by using a shadow mask. SEM images were obtained
with a Hitachi S4800 microscope. AFM images were measured by using
Bruker’s Dimension Icon. XRD experiments were conducted by
a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer.
