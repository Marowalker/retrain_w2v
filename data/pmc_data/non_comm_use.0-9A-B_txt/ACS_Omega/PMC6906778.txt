Salbutamol (SAL), one of the prohibited veterinary drugs,
has been
proven to be harmful to animals, but very few studies reported the
underlying mechanism of actions and the effects after SAL intake.
In this study, Ba-Ma minipigs were used as the animal model to demonstrate
the impacts of SAL residues on blood lipid and the lung bronchial
structures and the regulation of gene expression and gut microorganism
population. The results showed that (1) SAL decreased the indexes
of serum lipid and organ, (2) SAL widely retained in various tissues
and organs, (3) the lung bronchial expanded under the influence of
SAL, (4) the gene expression of growth-related ghrelin has increased,
and (5) the residues of SAL affected the composition of gut microorganism
population, which could be associated with the mechanism of action
of SAL on pig. The findings suggest that SAL could be harmful to minipigs
by altering the blood lipid, bronchial morphology, gastric mucosal
gene expression, and the gut microorganism population.

Introduction
Salbutamol (SAL) is a short-acting β2-adrenergic
receptor agonist, which has one chiral carbon atom in the SAL molecule
and two types of enantiomers: (R)-salbutamol and
(S)-salbutamol (Figure 1A,B). SAL is widely used to treat most types
of bronchial asthma and bronchospasm, with the advantages of good
safety, little irritation, and convenience of taking. Its pharmacological
activity is exerted by the (R)-salbutamol, while
the (S)-salbutamol is pharmacologically inert.1−3 It is unclear, however, whether SAL has any side effects on the
lung bronchial morphology. While SAL is useful commercially to improve
the animal’s lean meat ratio, the residual amount of SAL remaining
in the body is harmful to the animal’s health. To gain great
profit, the use of SAL is abused in the farm regardless of laws and
regulations. To protect public health, it is important to look into
the harmful effects of SAL to the body.

(S)-salbutamol.

A large number of studies on ghrelin gene expression
and gut microorganisms
highlighted their function on regulating diet and health. Ghrelin
is a hormone encoded by the ghrelin gene that plays a role in stimulating
gastric acid secretion to increase the appetite.4 According to the reports, SAL can promote the growth of
cattle, sheep, and other livestock, but whether the growth-promoting
effect is attributed to the alteration of ghrelin gene expression
still remains unclear.

The intestinal microorganisms are essential
to the host in the
regulation of physiological function, and they provide small molecule
nutrients, which can be absorbed directly into the blood stream. Studies
have shown that certain Gram-negative bacteria in the gut of pigs,
such as Klebsiella and Prevolla,
can produce leucine, while Bacteroides can produce
polysaccharide hydrolases that promote sugar degradation as well as
other small molecules such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate for
use in metabolism.5,6 Intestinal microorganisms are
also associated with the host’s obesity profile. Humans or
animals that frequently consume high-fat diet decrease the number
of Bifidobacteria in the gut microbiota and, at the
meantime, increase the population of Clostridium and Bacteroides. The alteration of species population might
have caused a lower rate of food metabolism, resulting in excessive
energy intake in the body, which eventually triggers obesity.7,8

The objective of this study was to systematically dissect
the side
effects of SAL on the growth and health of pigs from a new prospective.
Other than studying the residues of SAL in pigs, we have also looked
into the lung microstructure, the transcriptional levels of genes
in gastric mucosa, and the changes of gut microbiota population.

Results
Effects of SAL on the Body Weight and Viscera Indices
The changes of body weight gain and viscera indices are shown in Figure 2, and the feed efficiency
ratio (FER) and the dressing percentage (DP) of the control group
and SAL group are shown in Table 1. The results showed that the body weight gain, FER,
and DP in the SAL group increased in the control group, but the changes
were not significant, which suggested that SAL played a role in increasing
the growth efficiency.

indices.
All data are presented using mean ± SEM. *P <

The viscera indices of liver, spleen (1.42 ±

0.14 g/kg, P < 0.05), lung, kidney (6.53 ±
0.35 vs 7.79 ± 0.15 g/kg, P < 0.05) were
shown to be decreased in the SAL group, except for the heart (5.53
± 0.18 vs 4.90 ± 0.13 g/kg, P < 0.05)
with a significant increase (Figure 2B). These observations suggested that SAL may have
some interactions with the receptors in the heart that can subsequently
lead to atrophy of other organs.

Effects of SAL on the Serum Lipid and Antioxidant Indices
Compared with the control group in Figure 3, while the level of TG (0.22 ± 0.02
vs 0.59 ± 0.04 mmol/L, P < 0.01) decreased
significantly, the levels of TC (2.29 ± 1.12 vs 2.67 ± 0.45
mmol/L, P > 0.05) and LDL-C (0.94 ± 0.07
vs
1.15 ± 0.24 mmol/L, P > 0.05) also lowered
but
not significant. Meanwhile, the HDL-C level in blood lipid showed
a significant increase (11.79 ± 2.07 vs 2.88 ± 0.04 mmol/L, P < 0.05). To summarize, the overall changes of TG, TC,
LDL-C, and HDL-C indicated the function of SAL at decreasing fat level
in the blood.

capacity (T-AOC). All data are presented by mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

For the blood antioxidants, while the indices of
MDA (3.33 ±
1.5 vs 12.77 ± 0.51 μmol/L, P < 0.01),
SOD (75.3 ± 0.83 vs 98.09 ± 6.83 U/mL, P < 0.05), and T-AOC (1.93 ± 0.49 vs 5.57 ± 0.72 U/mL, P < 0.05) decreased significantly, the GSH-Px also decreased
(2.24 ± 0.26 vs 2.44 ± 0.27 mmol/L, P >
0.05) but not at a significant level. The results suggested that the
blood antioxidant capacity had been lowered in the presence of SAL
(Figure 3).

Residual Amount of SAL in the Feces and Organs
The
SAL residues were also detected in the gastric contents (14.50 ±
7.86 μg/kg), colon contents (1013.93 ± 234.75 μg/kg),
feces-15 d (53.95 ± 6.93 μg/kg), and feces-30 d (1597.64
± 141.68 μg/kg) (Figure 4A). With the prolonged feeding time, the feces became
the main excretion pathway for SAL.

SAL in gastric mucosa, gastric contents, colonic mucosa, colonic contents,

group. (B) The residual amount of SAL in heart, spleen, liver, lung,
and kidney of the SAL group. All data are presented by mean ±
SEM.

SAL was found to be widely distributed in the animal
tissues and
organs, including heart (48.75 ± 0.62 μg/kg), spleen (6.50
± 1.90 μg/kg), liver (31.45 ± 5.59 μg/kg), lung
(17.70 ± 4.70 μg/kg), kidney (10.40 ± 1.80 μg/kg),
gastric mucosa (19.09 ± 4.88 μg/kg), colonic mucosa (180.11
± 10.94 μg/kg), and muscle (2.90 ± 0.40 μg/kg)
(Figure 4B). Generally,
our results suggested that SAL remained mainly in the organs but less
in the muscles.

The parameters for the determination of SAL
by UPLC–MS/MS
are shown in Table 2. The method had a good linearity in a range of 0.4–3000 μg/kg
with an LOD of 0.12 μg/kg and LOQ of 0.38 μg/kg and a
recovery of 68%–80%.

Effects of SAL on the Lung Bronchial Morphology of Pigs
From the lung microstructure analysis (Figure 5), it was found that the control group had
a normal bronchial morphology with smooth muscle integrity and a normal
interval between adjacent bronchi. However, in the SAL group, the
bronchi showed irregularities with a narrower bronchial septum. Overall,
the differences in the lung morphology between the two groups indicated
that SAL had an impact on the bronchial structure.

pigs in the (A) control group and (B) SAL
group. The letter “B” indicated in the frame denotes
“bronchus”.

From the lung ultrastructural results (Figure 6), the tissues surrounding
the bronchi of
the control pigs were observed to be normal. However, in the SAL group,
the tissues surrounding the bronchi showed some level of damage with
and signs of purulent inflammation, which implicated an underlying
risk of bronchiectasis.

group and (B) SAL
group. The abbreviation “PBVI” in the box denotes “peribronchovascular
interstitium”.

Effects of SAL on the mRNA Expression Profiles in the Gastric
Mucosa
The changes of relative mRNA expression levels of
the ghrelin, MBOAT4, RETN, GCG, GCGR, and SST in the SAL group are
shown in Figure 7.
SAL significantly increased the mRNA expression of ghrelin (6-fold
vs control, P < 0.05) and SST (14-fold vs control, P < 0.05). The MBOAT4 (3-fold vs control, P > 0.05), GCG (4-fold vs control, P > 0.05),
and
GCGR (7-fold vs control, P > 0.05) mRNA expression
level also increased, but the changes were not significant. However,
the RETN gene mRNA expression in the SAL group was found to be unchanged
compared to that of the control group. The results suggested that
the residual SAL in the gastric mucosa may have an impact on the physiological
state of the gastric mucosa and changed the growth-related genes,
such as ghrelin and SST.

Effects of SAL on the Gut Microbiota Population
Illumina
MiSeq sequencing produced 583,689 valid DNA sequences (with 326,658
and 257,031 sequences for the control and SAL groups, respectively)
from the fecal samples. In general, it can be defined as an operational
taxonomy unit (OTU) when the similarity of different 16S rDNA sequences
exceeds 97%.

The Simpson, Shannon, and Chao1 analysis was used
to evaluate the species richness in the community ecology. The Simpson
indices did not show any significant difference between the control
and SAL groups, but the Shannon and Chao1 indices of the SAL group
(0.56 ± 0.32 vs 6.75 ± 0.04, P < 0.05
and 0.88 ± 0.05 vs 0.97 ± 0.03, P <
0.05, respectively) were both significantly decreased, compared to
the control group (Figure 8A–C). The results indicated that the richness of gut
microorganism species declined under the influence of SAL.

gut microbiota composition in pigs fed with SAL: (A)
Shannon index, (B) Simpson index, (C) Chao1 index, and (D) weighted
Unifrac PCoA of gut microbiota based on the OTU data.

The overall composition changes of the gut microbiota
population
were analyzed using the weighted UniFrac method, and the PCoA scores
clearly separated the control group from the SAL group in the PCoA
plot (Figure 8D), which
indicated that there was a change in the composition of the gut microorganism
population in the presence of SAL.

Microbial Shifts in Response to the Presence of SAL in the Gut
At the phylum level of the gut microbiomes, with the prolonged
feeding time, the proportion of Firmicutes increased
in both groups. However, the ratio of Bacteroidetes slightly increased at 15 days and then decreased at 30 days in the
control group, whereas it decreased during the entire duration tested
in the SAL group. The ratio of Spirochaetes in the
SAL group rose to 10.9% at 15 days, and then dropped to 4% at 30 days,
but in the control group, it increased up to the 9% at 30 days (Figure 9A).

of the average sequence reads at phylum
and class levels at (A) the phylum level and (B) the
class level in the gut. Control-0 d and SAL-0 d, control-15 d and
SAL-15 d, and control-30 d and SAL-30 d denote the feces collected
at 0, 15, and 30 days in the control and SAL groups, respectively.

Clostridia and Bacteroidia were
the most abundant classes in the phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, respectively. The proportion
of Clostridia increased from 32.5 to 55.56% and 37.63
to 70.83% in the control group and SAL group, respectively. The proportion
of Bacteroidia decreased to 25.13% at 30 days in
the control group, but when SAL was supplemented, it reduced from
46.13 to 12.83% (Figure 9B).

Effects of SAL on the Microbiota Genus Variation in the Gut
A total of 160 genera were identified in the feces of the control
and SAL groups at the three-time points (0, 15, and 30 days), and
27 genera with an abundance level of more than 2.5% in at least one
group are shown in Figure 10A. As the feeding time prolonged, there were nine and five
genera with increasing abundance and 8 and 13 genera with decreasing
abundance in the control and SAL groups, respectively. After 30 days
of feeding with SAL, eight genera, including Clostridium XI, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto, Parabacteroides, and Lactobacillus and the unclassified Clostridiaceae, Mogibacteriaceae, and Veillonellaceae enhanced the abundance in
the SAL group, whereas the other 21 genera showed a trend of decreasing
abundance, compared to the control group.

*P < 0.05, +P < 0.01. All data were presented after log 2.

The correlation between SAL fecal residues and
the abundance of
27 genera in the SAL group are shown in Figure 10B. The average SAL residues in the feces
samples were 0, 53.95, and 1597.64 μg/kg at 0, 15, and 30 days,
respectively. In the presence of SAL, there were five genera that
showed a positive correlation with SAL residues, including the unclassified Clostridiaceae (R = 0.958, 0.954, 0.967), Clostridium XI (R = 0.994, 1, 0.999), Turicibacter (R = 0.999, 1, 1), Clostridium sensu stricto (R = 0.997, 0.999,
0.996), and unclassified Mogibacteriaceae (R = 1, 1, 0.999). The other 22 genera showed a negative
correlation with SAL residues in at least two pigs, and the Lactobacillus (R = −0.885, −0.957,
−0.975), Barnesiella (R =
−0.838, −0.954, −0.937), Ruminococcus (R = −0.998, −0.975, −0.864), Oscillibacter (R = −0.988, −0.99,
−0.996), unclassified_S24-7 (R = −0.897, −0.978, −0.938), Blautia (R = −0.997, −0.97, −0.923),
and unclassified Veillonellaceae (R = −0.684, −0.815, −0.959) presented higher
negative correlation indices than the other genera.

Discussion
Due to the effects of salbutamol on improving
the animal production
efficiency, more and more researchers focus on delivering the positive
production benefits to the swine industry. In a previous study, the
body weight of pigs fed with 2 mg/kg (R)-salbutamol
for 4 weeks showed a significant increase compared with those of the
control group, the 4 mg/kg (R)-salbutamol group,
and the 8 mg/kg group.9 Meanwhile, the
same study conducted by Yousefi et al10 demonstrated that 5 mg/L salbutamol was more effective at increasing
feed intake and body weight gain than the 10 and 15 mg/L diet for
broiler chickens. However, when we fed the pigs with 5 mg/kg SAL containing
both (R)-salbutamol and (S)-salbutamol
for 30 days, the body weight gain, FER, and DP in the SAL group were
all improved but not significant. Thus, we concluded that the high
concentrations of SAL and the racemic mixture of (R,S)-salbutamol may have contributed to the insignificant
increase of the pigs’ weight gain.

In previous studies
using mice models, the serum lipid indices
were used to evaluate the level of obesity.11,12 As shown in Figure 3, the concentrations of TG significantly decreased while the HDL-C
index significantly increased, which can be used as the markers that
promoted fat decomposition.13,14 Superoxide dismutase
(SOD), which plays a role in removing free radicals generated in vivo,
was found to be effective at inhibiting cardiovascular diseases and
preventing atherosclerosis.15,16 When the pigs were
fed with SAL diet for 30 days, the SOD levels in the blood stream
significantly decreased and the MDA increased dramatically, which
indicated that SAL could reduce the total antioxidant molecules, which
in turn increase the free radicals and accelerate the risk of cardiovascular
diseases.

Similar to clenbuterol, salbutamol has the propensity
to accumulate
in tissues and organs that cause adverse reactions. According to previous
reports, the cattle heart rate beats faster after taking clenbuterol
for 1 h, which was in agreement with our results. Gojmerac reported
that pigs fed with a diet containing clenbuterol showed symptoms of
slight hyperplasia of the bile duct, inflammation of the liver interstitium,
and degeneration of the liver cells. These indices, including ALB,
ALT, AST, AKP, and TBILI, are considered indicators of liver functions.
When pigs were fed with the SAL diet, these indicators could become
abnormal and the liver indices decreased significantly.17 In this experiment, the liver indices of the
SAL group were lower than those of the control group, and the mean
residual value of SAL in the liver was 31.45 μg/kg. The results
showed that SAL contributed to the damage and the normal function
of the liver.

To our knowledge, SAL is extensively used for
the clinical treatment
of asthma,18−20 but the side effects of SAL on the lungs were rarely
reported. From our results (Figures 5 and 6), SAL caused bronchial
lumen expansion in the lungs and some destruction to tissues near
the bronchi, which enhanced the risk of bronchiectasis. Patients with
bronchiectasis are often accompanied by chronic cough, massive purulent
sputum, and repeated hemoptysis.21 Therefore,
in clinical settings, the dosage and duration of administration of
salbutamol as a drug should be carefully applied to avoid an adverse
effect on the lung bronchi.

To date, as far as we are aware,
no studies have reported about
the effects of SAL on the gene expression related to growth in the
stomach of pigs. The hormones of the gastrointestinal tract secreted
by the endocrine cells in the body play an important role in regulating
the activities of stomach and intestines, such as secretion, absorption,
and movement.22,23 The ghrelin hormone, known as
the “hunger hormone”, can function as a neuropeptide,
which acts on the hypothalamic brain cells to increase the sense of
hunger as well as on the gastric acid secretion to stimulate the body
for food intake. The ghrelin hormone exhibits similar motility with
the motilin. Some studies have shown that the intragastric injection
of the ghrelin hormone in rats could stimulate the gastric acid secretion,
which in turn speeds up the gastric emptying and intestinal delivery
of liquid diet.24 Dogs treated with SAL
showed a higher plateau of gastrin concentration in the plasma than
that in the control group.25−27 When we fed SAL (5 mg/kg) to
pigs for 30 days, they showed a strong appetite with a significantly
increased level of the ghrelin gene. Thus, we concluded that SAL could
alter the appetite and growth by regulating ghrelin expression.

Unlike the ghrelin hormone, the main physiological function of
SST hormones is the inhibition of cell proliferation, regulation of
neurotransmitters release, and inhibition of gastric acid.28,29 Many studies have shown that the levels of ghrelin and SST hormones
are associated with the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal inflammation.30 In this study, the ghrelin and SST gene expression
levels in the SAL group were significantly increased. We can deduce
that the elevated ghrelin gene expression serves to increase the gastrointestinal
activity to contribute to the body growth, whereas the body’s
immunity stimulates the SST gene expression to protect the stomach.

A previous study has shown that different intestinal parts of pigs
have different microorganism composition.31 The dominant bacteria in the small intestine were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and the dominant bacteria in
the large intestine were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. However, the composition of microorganisms in various regions of
the large intestine (such as cecum, colon, rectum, etc.) is not identical.32,33 Starch, protein, and fat can be metabolized in the small intestine,
and the undigested cellulose can be metabolized by microorganisms
in the large intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids, which are
then absorbed by the body as an extra source of energy. The gut microbiota
composition in the large intestine of obese individuals has been shown
to have an increased proportion of Firmicutes and
decreased Bacteroidetes.(34,35) This composition feature equipped the gut microbiota the ability
to specially increase nutrient absorption, resulting in excessive
energy intake for the body and eventually leads to obesity.36,37 In our study, however, we examined the gut microbiota in pig feces
and found that with the prolonged feeding time, SAL increased the
population level of Firmicutes and reduced the proportion
of Bacteroidetes, which indicated that the microbiota
composition changes attributed to SAL were similar to those in obese
individuals but with the exception that SAL also reduced the serum
lipid level. The results suggested that the changes of the proportion
of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes may
not be the major factor.

The phyla of Fibrobacteria and Bacteroidetes are regarded as the major contributors
to fat accumulation among
human intestinal microorganisms with Clostridium is
being one of the biggest genera in the phylum of Fibrobacteria.(38) The intestine is rich in metabolic
enzymes including polysaccharide hydrolase, phosphotransferase, and
fructosidase, which can promote the catabolism of cellulose into short-chain
fatty acids to allow an increased energy intake in the body. The existence
of Clostridium in the gut of obese individuals is
regarded to be associated with these enzymes.39,40 The fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) is associated with fat
metabolisms. The body fat accumulates in the body when FIFA expression
is suppressed.41 A number of studies have
shown that the increased proportion of Clostridium inhibited the expression of FIFA.42Bacteroides has also been found to produce polysaccharide-hydrolyzing
enzymes, and the level of enzyme production increases in the presence
of Clostridium.(43) It is
not clear whether the increased proportion of Clostridium is the main contributor of polysaccharide hydrolase produced in
the gut. The actual role of Clostridium in contributing
to the amount of short-chain fatty acids produced and higher energy
intake of the host is also unknown. In this experiment, Clostridium showed a positive correlation with the SAL fecal residues of all
three pigs. The increased abundance of unclassified Clostridiales was similar to that of the microbiota composition of obese individuals
but completely the opposite of skinny individuals. Nevertheless, the
role of Clostridium and Bacteroides in contributing to obesity needs to be further clarified with studies
that illustrate the correlation between Clostridium and SAL.

Turicibacter, a Gram-positive bacteria,
originally
isolated from the blood of patients with acute appendicitis is also
found in the ileum of sufferers with ulcerative colitis.44,45 A number of studies have reported that the dietary type has an impact
to the presence of Turicibacter. The abundance of Turicibacter was found to have improved in the pigs fed
with a high-starch diet.46 However, the
physiological characteristics and the function of Turicibacter in the intestine are generally not very clear. In the present study,
the Turicibacter was not detected in the feces of
pigs in the control group, but it was shown to be increased linearly
with the presence of SAL in feces. Similarly, the relative proportion
of Turicibacter in obese mice was found to be lower
than that in mice fed with a normal diet.47 Thus, it is possible that the non-obese pigs due to SAL in turn
contributed to the increase of Turicibacter.

As for the genera that decreased linearly with the presence of
SAL in feces, the Prevotella was found to be the
predominant genera in the control group, but the population was decreased
in the SAL group. Prevotella has a positive correlation
to the body weight gain as it can metabolize food to produce short
chain fatty acids, which are growth stimulants for young pigs.48,49 The pigs in the SAL group had a higher body weight gain than those
in the control group with a significantly decreased level of the blood
lipids, such as TC, TG and LDL-C, suggesting that the alteration of
the Prevotella abundance may be one of the contributing
factors to decrease the level of fat in pigs.

For other genera,
the population of unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillus in the SAL group was found to
be decreased linearly with feeding time. The characteristics of microbial
metabolic pathways may be the explanation why Rumenococcus is the dominant genus under high protein and animal fat diet.

The high-activity multienzyme complexes known as cellulosomes produced
by the Ruminococcus genus can degrade insoluble xyloglucan,
wood poly sugar, and cellulose to short-chain fatty acids.50 The presence of SAL decreased the proportion
of Ruminococcaceae, which then reduce the intake
of additional energy and promote intestinal peristalsis. Lactobacillus, as the representative of probiotics, is known to provide health
benefits to the host.51Lactobacillus curvatus K313 and K243 isolated from
the chicken intestine were found to have an inhibitory effect on the
adhesion of Salmonella and the reduction of proinflammatory
cytokine transcription.52Lactobacillus plantarum 10hk2 can modulate the anti-inflammatory
factors in murine macrophage RAW264.7.53 SAL decreased Lactobacillus in the gut of pigs
and altered the balance of gut microorganism population, which in
turn reduced the immune function.

In conclusion, with minipigs
fed with SAL as the model, we demonstrated
that SAL reduced the serum lipid, caused pulmonary bronchiectasis,
increased the ghrelin gene expression, and altered the composition
of gut microbiota. This study presented an insight into the bronchial
expansion and gene expression related to growth. The role of gut microbiota
in the presence of SAL requires further investigation.

In this study, a total of six one-month-old
castrated Ba-Ma minipigs (Sus scrofa domestica) weighing 2.93 ± 0.19 kg were purchased from Zhejiang Kaihua
Hongxing Co., Ltd. All pigs were fed with the same standard commercial
feed at 100 g/day with sufficient water for a week. The pigs were
randomly separated into two groups of three. The pigs in the control
group received only standard feed for 30 days, while the pigs in the
SAL group received salbutamol sulfate purchased from the Jiangsu Yabang
Epson Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. at a concentration of 5 mg/kg in their
feed for 30 days. The pigs in the control group and SAL group were
all fed 100 g/day in the first 5 days and the amount increased by
100 g every subsequent 5 days until it reaches 500 g/day. Fresh feces
samples in the two groups were collected at designated time points
of 0, 15, and 30 days and then stored at −80 °C. The weight
of pigs was also recorded on the same day.

UPLC–MS/MS Instrument and Conditions
The UPLC
system was coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters,
Milford, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source
operated in the positive ion mode. Separations were carried out on
a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm)
and the column temperature was set at 25 °C. The mobile phase
was consisted of 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and MeOH (solvent B)
with a flow rate at 0.3 mL/min. The following gradient profile was
used: 0–1 min: maintaining 10% B; 1–4.5 min: linear
from 10 to 50% B; 4.5–4.6 min: 50 to 90% B; 4.6–6.7
min: maintaining 10% B; 6.7–6.8 min: 90 to 10%; 6.8–9
min: maintaining 10% B. The precursor ions were m/z 240.1 for SAL [M + H+] and 243.2 for
the internal standard SAL-D3 [M + H+]. Quantification was
performed using MRM by monitoring the ion transitions m/z 240.1 > 148.1 for SAL and 243.2 > 151.1
for SAL-D3.

Sample Preparation
For detection of SAL, 2 ± 0.1
g of sample was added into a centrifuge tube comprising 8 mL of ammonium
acetate buffer, 40 μL of β-glucosidase, and 100 μL
of SAL-D3 internal standard (100 μg/mL). The mixture was incubated
at 37 °C for 16 h in the dark. Then, the solution was centrifuged,
pH-adjusted, and extracted with ethyl acetate and tert-butyl methyl ether. Finally, SAL was extracted by SPE and then injected
in UPLC–MS/MS.

Method Parameters
The linearity of the calibration
curve was assessed by analyzing a series of standards at the concentrations
of 0.4, 1, 3, 30, 300, 900, and 3000 ng/mL for SAL. The LOD and LOQ
for the target compounds were calculated as signal-to-noise ratios
of 3:1 and 10:1, respectively. Recovery was calculated by comparing
the peak areas of the analytes from spiked samples with those from
the spiked mobile phase at three different concentrations including
10, 50, and 450 ng/mL.

Measurement of Blood Lipid and Antioxidant Indices
Blood lipid measurements, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride
(TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood antioxidant measurements,
including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), were
performed in our laboratory using kits purchased from the Nanjing
JianCheng Bioengineering Institute.

Preparation of Lung Tissue Section
The original lung
samples were fixed in the 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution, post-fixed
with 1% tannic acid, and embedded in the glycidyl ether after dehydration
with alcohol. The semi thin sections of 1 μm were cut with glass
knives, stained with methylene blue, and then examined with a light
microscope (Olympus BX-60, Olympus, Japan). The ultrathin sections
of 40 nm were made with a diamond knife, stained with uranium acetate
and lead citrate for 5–15 min, and then examined with electron
microscopy (JEM-1200EX, Hitachi, Japan).

RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted
from the gastric mucosa samples using TransZolUp Plus RNA kit (TransGen,
Beijing, China). Isolated RNA was quantified by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The RNA purity was evaluated with
the ratio of OD260/280 and OD260/230, and its integrity was confirmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis.

The RNA extracted was reverse
transcribed to cDNA using the TransScript kit (TransGen, Beijing,
China). A total of 1 μg of RNA, 5 μL of TransScript ALL-in-One
SuperMix, 1 μL gDNA remover, and variable RNase-free water were
added into a centrifuge tube. The mixture solution was then incubated
for 15 min at 42 °C and heated for 5 s at 85 °C.

Six
target genes were chosen for qPCR to analyze the mRNA expression
levels in the gastric mucosa of the SAL group and the control group.
The six target genes include ghrelin, membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 4 (MBOAT4), resistin (RETN), glucagon
(GCG), glucagon receptor (GCGR), and somatostatin (SST). Primers were
designed using the sequences obtained from NCBI, and the primer sequences
are shown in Table 3. RT-qPCR was performed with the cDNA template diluted 30 times using
the Tip Green qPCR SuperMix kit (TransGen, Beijing). The PCR reaction
procedure was performed with these steps: 5 min at 95 °C followed
by 40 temperature cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 10 s at 72 °C
using the Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). β-actin
was used as the reference gene. The relative expression quantity of
gene was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCt method.

16S rDNA Sequencing
Total bacterial DNA was extracted
from the feces sample. The DNA concentration was determined using
NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). The PCR primers are
designed around the conserved regions of V3 and V4. The forward and
reverse primers are 319F 5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′
and 806R 5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′, respectively. After
the first amplification, different adapters and barcodes were added
at each pair of primers. Then, the amplified PCR products were sequenced
at L C-Bio Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China) using an Illumina MiSeq platform.

Statistical Analysis
For data analysis, the raw data
were processed with several steps: (1) The barcode and linker sequences
for reads were removed. (2) Each pair of paired end reads could be
combined into a single longer tag. (3) The tags containing more than
5% of N (N indicates undefined base information) and low-quality tags
(20% or more of the total number of bases with Q <
10) were removed.

To test the differences in physiological and
biochemical values for correlation analysis, normally distributed
data were analyzed using the independent sample t-test and Pearson correlations, respectively (SPSS, (version 20.0),
Chicago, IL, USA), and all data were presented as means ± SEM.
The differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.
