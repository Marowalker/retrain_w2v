Luminescence ratiometric thermometry,
on the basis of nonthermally
linked states of lanthanides, became a hot research issue recently
because of its several attractive features. Here, the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions of Ho3+ embedded
in calcium tungstate host are taken as an example to show the influence
of laser pump power on this temperature detection technology. The
luminescence intensity ratio between the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 upconversion emission lines was found to respond
monotonously to the temperature between 303 and 603 K and could be
fitted well with the use of an empirical function. It suggested that
this ratio might be suitable for temperature measurement. However,
at 303 K, the temperature readout derived from this ratio decreased
from 303 to 248 K on increasing the laser pump power from 35 to 205
mW (the irradiated spot’s area: ca. 2 mm2). This
uncommon phenomenon differs from the conventional laser-induced heating
effect. With the help of the Boltzmann distribution based on the two
Stark components of the 5F5 state of Ho3+, the laser-induced heating was calculated to be ca. 20 K
when the excitation power was 205 mW. Thus, this suggested that there
should be a mechanism responsible for the gradually decreasing temperature
readout. It was then confirmed that this mechanism was the different
dependences for the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions
on laser pump power, which was much stronger than the laser-induced
heating effect. A calibration method to eliminate the influence of
laser power dependence on luminescence ratiometric thermometry was
then proposed.

Introduction
As is well known, temperature plays a
key role in many fields,
ranging from the biological domain to electronic devices.1−4 In general, temperature is expected to provide us much useful information
based on which we can monitor the real time state of the object of
interest and make a decision promptly. Because of the significance
of temperature, recent years have witnessed the boom of thermometers,
among which the luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) method, based on
the 4f–4f transitions of lanthanides, is especially attractive
for its short response time and noncontact working mode.5−10 So far, it has been demonstrated that the LIR method can be realized
for thermal sensing through two main routes, that are, using thermally
coupled energy levels (TCELs) or two states which are not in thermal
equilibrium (nonTCELs).11,12 Although the former
route occurs earlier than the latter, to the best of our knowledge,
its relative thermal sensitivity is, in general, relatively small
and not so ideal.13−20 Using nonTCELs for temperature measurement may help solve the problem
and circumvent the limitations of conventional TCELs-based thermometry.
It has gained considerable attention nowadays, as proven by the fact
that the references concerning thermometry based on nonTCELs are much
more than those based on TCELs. However, the important point, that
is, whether nonTCELs can be applied or not, is rarely studied in the
field.

Generally, the processes for the populations of TCELs
are the same
because the gap between the two levels of TCELs is less than the threshold
2000 cm–1.16 Therefore,
it is unnecessary to consider the effect of laser pump power on the
LIR between this pair of TCELs. Nonetheless, the energy gap between
nonTCELs (ascribed to one kind of rare earth ion) is much larger than
2000 cm–1. Thus, the channels to populate the two
levels of nonTCELs may be different.21 In
this case, it becomes meaningful to consider and correct the effect
of laser pump power on the LIR between this pair of nonTCELs. Here,
the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels of Ho3+ are taken as a typical example.
These two levels are far from each other, and their space is ca. 3000
cm–1 in various hosts. Therefore, they are not in
thermal equilibrium. In this case, the ways to populate the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels may be different from each other. It suggests that the populations
of the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels are not likely to possess the same dependence
on laser pump power, being an indication that the LIR between these
two levels probably depends on laser pump power, to some degree. This
is, obviously, not good for the practical application of nonTCELs.

This problem may be serious but is easily neglected. Chen’s
group did the pioneering work concerning this issue.22 However, laser-induced heating was rarely considered. Moreover,
related work is scarcely reported. To thoroughly investigate this
issue and to push the LIR method based on nonTCELs as being more applicable,
here, the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions
of Ho3+ embedded in calcium tungstate host are taken as
the object to be studied. CaWO4:Yb3+–Ho3+ phosphors were prepared according to a simple high temperature
solid state method. The temperature-dependent upconversion (UC) emission
spectra of the as-synthesized phosphors, following the near-infrared
(NIR) laser diode excitation at 980 nm, were investigated in detail,
aiming to show that the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions responded sensitively to temperature. In the next step,
laser pump power was found to have an influence on the LIR between
the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions and thus
on the temperature readings derived from the LIR. What’s more,
a calibration method to eliminate the influence of laser power dependence
on luminescence ratiometric thermometry was proposed.

Experimental
Section
CaO, WO3, Yb2O3,
and Ho2O3 particles (>99.99%) were all of
analytical purity.
All involved chemicals were used as purchased without any further
purification. CaWO4:10%Yb3+–1%Ho3+ phosphors were prepared via the traditional high temperature
solid state method, the specific procedure for which can be found
anywhere.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples was
carried out (Rigaku
D/MAX-2600/PC with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å)
at room temperature. A continuous wave 980 nm laser diode, whose current
and output were controlled by the adjustor (ITC-4005, Thorlabs), was
used as the excitation source. The spot of the samples irradiated
by the laser diode was kept unchanged throughout the whole experiment,
and its area was estimated to be 2 mm2. The UC luminescence
of phosphors was first focused by a lens with f =
3.8 cm, followed by the collection of this luminescence with the use
of a monochromator (Omni-λ 3005, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd)
coupled with a commonly used photomultiplier tube (PMTH-S1-CR131,
Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd). The slit width of the monochromator was
set to be 2 mm. The voltage imposed on the photomultiplier tube was
set to be −600 V. The sample was heated by a homemade heating
chamber with an accuracy of ±0.3 K in the range of 303–783
K. In the stage of detecting the temperature-dependent UC luminescence
of phosphors, only the temperature of the prepared phosphors was changed
from 303 to 603 K, with a step increase of 20 K. When studying the
double logarithmic plot of the UC emission bands’ intensities
as a function of laser pump power, other experimental setups were
kept unchanged except for the laser pump power of the irradiated point of phosphors.

Results and Discussion
The XRD patterns
of the prepared phosphors are presented in the
inset in Figure 1a.
It is found that the diffraction peaks of the samples are in good
accordance with the reference date with number 41-1431 from the Joint
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, indicating that CaWO4:Yb3+–Ho3+ phosphors were prepared
successfully and crystalized well, with the scheelite structure.23Figure 1a presents the room temperature UC emission spectrum of CaWO4:Yb3+–Ho3+ phosphors, following
the NIR excitation at 980 nm. As can be observed, there are three
emission bands peaking at 540, 658, and 755 nm, respectively. According
to the literature, the 5F4,5S2–5I8, 5F5–5I8 and 5F4,5S2–5I7 transitions
of Ho3+ should be separately responsible for these three
emission lines, as depicted in Figure 1b.22 Following the NIR excitation
by a 980 nm laser diode, Yb3+ at the 2F7/2 level absorb these NIR photons and jump to the higher 2F5/2 level. An energy transfer (ET) from Yb3+ to Ho3+ occurs, exciting the latter ions to the 5I6 level from the 5I8 level.
In the next step, there are two possible routes. For one thing, the
excited Ho3+ relax quickly to the lower 5I7 level. Another ET from Yb3+ to Ho3+ excites the latter ions to the 5F5 level,
from where the 5F5–5I8 transition takes place and leads to the 658 nm emission line.
For another, Ho3+ at the 5I6 level
are further excited to the 5F4,5S2 level by an ET process from Yb3+ to Ho3+, which is followed by the 5F4,5S2–5I8 and 5F4,5S2–5I7 transitions.

(b) Energy level diagram of the Yb3+–Ho3+ system and the possible UC processes.

Following the NIR excitation by a 980 nm laser diode, the
UC emission
spectra of the phosphors were collected successfully, in the temperature
range of 303–603 K. As can be observed from Figure 2a, both the 540 and 658 nm
emission lines decrease constantly on increasing the temperature from
303 to 603 K, which is likely to be ascribed to the thermal quenching
effect (e.g., nonradiative relaxation). For a clear visual observation,
all these emission spectra shown in Figure 2a have been normalized to the 658 nm emission,
as presented in Figure 2b. It can be seen that the 540 nm emission line, and thus the LIR
between the 540 and 658 nm lines (labeled as LIR540/658 here), decreases markedly with the increase of temperature from
303 to 603 K. By integrating the 530–555 nm and 625–675
nm spectral regions, the emission intensities of the 540 and 658 nm
lines can be obtained, respectively. One can see from Figure 2c that although both emission
lines decrease gradually, there is a minor difference between them.
Compared with the 658 nm emission line, the 540 nm one exhibits a
faster decrease rate. Owing to this rate difference, LIR540/658 can be regarded as a temperature indicator. Figure 2d shows this ratio as a function of temperature
in the range between 303 and 603 K. Considering that there is no physically
clear model or theory to describe LIR540/658, it is thus
fitted by an empirical expression. This method had been used several
times in previous literature.24 The empirical
expression used here is 1  where LIR is the emission intensity
ratio
between the 540 and 658 nm emission lines and A, B, and C are constants. As can be observed
from Figure 2d, these
experimental data points are in good accordance with eq 1 (with r2 > 0.999). The fit results for the parameters are A = 2.8, B = 50.2, and C = 1086
K. It thus suggests, undoubtedly, that the 540 and 658 nm emission
lines can be used for ratiometric thermal sensing.

UC emission spectra of phosphors following the NIR excitation at 980
nm. (c) 540 and 658 nm emission lines’ intensities and (d)
their ratio as a function of temperature; the inset in (d) shows the
relative sensitivities for the 540 and 658 nm emission lines.

It is known that the relative
sensitivity, Sr, is a key parameter to
evaluate the performance of thermometers.
According to the definition, Sr can be
written as16,25−27 2  

Based on eq 2, the
relative sensitivity for the 540 and 658 nm emission lines was achieved,
as shown in the inset in Figure 2d. As can be observed, Sr decreases gradually from 0.45 to 0.27 K%–1 on
increasing the temperature from 303 to 603 K. The average Sr was calculated to be 0.33 K%–1 over the whole experimental temperature range.

It can be known
from Figure 2a that
the 540 and 658 nm emission bands are separated by
a gap of ca. 3300 cm–1 which is much larger than
2000 cm–1. Therefore, the 540 and 658 nm emission
bands are nonthermally linked. Because of this large gap and the complex
UC processes, the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels might possess different dependences
on laser pump power. It further indicates that the LIR between the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels is probably sensitive to laser pump power, which is
then investigated. Figure 3a presents LIR540/658 as a function of laser pump
power at 303 K. As can be observed, LIR540/658 increases
gradually on increasing the laser pump power. From eq 1, we have 3  where Tcal is
the calculated temperature when the value of LIR540/658 is known. Substituting LIR540/658 obtained under the
different excitation conditions presented in Figure 3a into eq 3, the temperature, Tcal was obtained, as depicted in the top panel in Figure 3b. It can be seen that Tcal decreases markedly on increasing the laser pump power.
By using the expression Terr = Tcal – Tmea, where Tmea is the practical temperature
measured by a thermocouple and it is 303 K here, the temperature error, Terr, was obtained, as presented in the bottom
panel in Figure 3b.
As can be observed, as the laser pump power is increased, Terr reaches −55 K at the 205 mW excitation
condition. At this point, it must be stressed that according to conventional
recognition, that is, laser-induced heating, Tcal is expected to increase gradually on increasing the laser
pump power. Therefore, the laser-induced temperature decreasing phenomenon,
shown in Figure 3b,
indicates that in addition to laser-induced heating effect, there
must be, at least, another mechanism playing a dominant role in the
determination of LIR540/658. In this work, this mechanism
is confirmed to be the dependence of LIR540/658 on the
laser pump power. Obviously, it is necessary to distinguish the laser-induced
heating first.

Figure 3 (a) LIR540/658 and (b) temperatures calculated
based
on eq 3 and temperature
errors as a function of laser pump power.

As can be observed from the inset in the top right of Figure 2b, the 642 nm emission
peak increases gradually with temperature, which can be explained
as follows. The 642 and 657 nm emission bands are ascribed to the
transitions from the two Stark components of the 5F5 level to the 5I8 level of Ho3+. The gap between the two 5F5 Stark sublevels
is calculated to be ca. 355 cm–1, which is much
smaller than the threshold 2000 cm–1 that ensures
a thermal equilibrium between two closely spaced levels, indicating
that the two 5F5 Stark sublevels are thermally
linked. Therefore, according to the Boltzmann distribution, the upper
level will be populated at the expense of the depopulation of the
lower one. On the basis of this theory, the LIR between the 642 and
657 nm emission bands, marked as LIR642/657, can be expressed
as25−33 4  where D is a pre-exponential
factor and ΔE is the gap between the TCELs.

As confirmed by Quintanilla et al.,34 an error will be introduced by the effect of laser heating when
obtaining the thermal calibration curve in ratiometric thermometry
as during the calibration the samples are always illuminated with
the laser. Therefore, the laser heating effect should be considered
first. As can be seen from Figure 4a, LIR642/657 increases gradually on increasing
the laser power from 35 to 205 mW because of the laser-induced heating.
At relatively high laser powers, LIR642/657 changes markedly.
In contrast, in the power range below 35 mW, LIR642/657 keeps nearly unchanged. This phenomenon is similar to previous literature.34 It means that there is little heat generated
by laser irradiation in the low pump power limit. Therefore, the laser
power was set to be 35 mW during the achievement of the calibration
curve for the emission bands of Ho3+, aiming to eliminate
the laser heating in maximal degree. Figure 4b shows LIR642/657 as a function
of temperature between 303 and 603 K under the excitation of 35 mW.
As can be observed, LIR642/657 gradually increases from
0.80 to 1.02 on increasing the temperature from 303 to 603 K. These
experimental points are in good agreement with eq 4, and the fit results are A = 1.312(3) and ΔE/k = 148(1)
K. Equation 4 can be
further expressed as 5  

Figure 4 (a) LIR642/657 as a function of laser pump power at
303 K; (b) LIR642/657 as a function of temperature between
303 and 603 K under the excitation of ca. 35 mW; and (c) calculated
laser-induced temperatures as a function of laser pump power.

On the basis of this equation,
the temperatures under different
laser pump excitations were calculated, as presented in Figure 4c. One can see that the temperature
increases from 303 to ca. 323 K on increasing the laser pump power
from 35 to 205 mW.

As mentioned above and as shown in the bottom
panel in Figure 3b,
LIR540/658 decreases markedly on increasing the laser pump
power. For comparison,
it is also shown in Figure 5, labeled as Σ. It is obvious that this phenomenon is
caused by two reasons, laser-induced heating and laser power dependence
of LIR540/658. The laser-induced heating is also depicted
in Figure 5 for comparison
and is marked by Λ. Therefore, the pure power dependence of
LIR540/658, Ω, should be equal to Σ –
Λ. As can be observed from Figure 5, Ω decreases gradually from 0 to −75
K on increasing the laser power from 35 to 205 mW.

Figure 5 Temperature errors generated
by (Λ) laser-induced heating,
(Ω) laser power dependence, and (Σ) the combination of
these two mechanisms as a function of laser pump power.

As demonstrated previously, the UC luminescence
intensity, Iem, can be expressed as35 6  where Q is a constant, P is the laser pump power, and n is the
photon number needed to excite the emitting levels involved. The 540
and 658 nm emission lines’ intensities are shown in Figure 6a as a function of
laser pump power, with the double logarithmic plot. It can be seen
that the two slopes of the linear fits for the 540 and 658 nm emission
bands are 1.867(5) and 1.707(7), respectively. It suggests that both
the emission lines are probably from two-photon UC processes, as depicted
in Figure 1b. The two
slopes were, however, found to be slightly different from each other.
It suggests that the 540 and 658 nm emission lines come from different
two-photon UC mechanisms, although the slopes are both close to 2.
From Figure 6a, we
have 7   8  where Q540 and Q658 are two constants. Based on eqs 7 and 8, the
following can be obtained 9  

Figure 6 (a)
540 and 658 nm emission lines’ intensities and (b) LIR540/658 as a function of laser pump power, with the double
logarithmic plot.

It means that LIR540/658 is proportional to the laser
power term P0.16. Figure 6b presents LIR540/658 as a function
of laser pump power, with the double logarithmic plot. As can be observed,
LIR540/658 increases markedly with the increase of laser
pump power. It is obvious that LIR540/658 is dependent
on laser pump power. The slope of the linear fit was calculated to
0.159(3), being quite close to the expected value of 0.160(7). This
fact indicates that the 540 and 658 nm emission lines, although both
are from a two-photon UC mechanism, exhibit different dependence on
laser pump power. It means that there are two different mechanisms
or routes responsible for the 5F4,5S2 and 5F5 levels, and this is the
fundamental cause for the dependence of LIR540/658 on laser
pump power.

As there is power dependence of LIR540/658 on laser
power, using the 540 and 658 nm emission lines for ratiometric thermal
sensing becomes unreliable, to some degree. This has been demonstrated
in Figure 3. Specifically,
at a certain temperature, if two different laser pump powers are used,
the two temperatures calculated from LIR540/658 values
may be different, thus leading to an error. To overcome the limitation
of the thermometer based on these two nonthermally linked bands, here,
we propose a possible valid calibration method with the use of eqs 1 and 9. Equation 9 can be
further written as 10  

If we take LIR540/658 obtained under
the excitation
of 35 mW laser power (labeled as LIR540/658(35)) as a reference,
we have 11  

Therefore, LIR540/658 obtained under a certain excitation
of X mW, LIR540/658(X), can be expressed as 12  

On the basis of eqs 11 and 12, we have 13  

Combining eqs 1 and 13, we have 14  

Based on eq 14, the
LIR540/658(X) obtained at different laser
pump powers has been corrected, and the results are presented in Figure 7 labeled as the green
rhombuses. As can be observed, the corrected LIR540/658(X) keeps nearly unchanged at different laser pump
powers, suggesting that the LIR540/658(X), after calibration, is immune to laser pump power. Therefore, the
influence of laser pump power on LIR540/658 for ratiometric
thermal sensing is eliminated. It indicates that the proposed calibration
method is valid.

a function
of laser pump power obtained at 303 K.

Conclusions
In a word, LIR540/658 was demonstrated
to exhibit a
monotonous and sensitive response to the temperature in the range
of 303–603 K and it could be fitted well via an empirical formula.
However, the temperature readout derived from this ratio decreased
markedly from 303 to 248 K on increasing the laser pump power from
35 to 205 mW, with a maximum error of −55 K, being different
from the expectation of laser heating effect. The different dependences
for the 5F4,5S2/5F5–5I8 transitions on laser
pump power were confirmed to be responsible for this phenomenon. A
calibration method to diminish the influence of laser pump power was
then proposed and verified for CaWO4:10%Yb3+–1%Ho3+ phosphors. It must be mentioned, however,
that the feasibility and universality of this strategy should be checked
in more compounds doped with different kinds of rare earth ions in
the future.
