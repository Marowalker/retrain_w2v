Diethylaminoethyl
end-modified poly(ethylene glycol) (DEAE-PEG)
has been synthesized for the noncovalent PEGylation of proteins. The
resulting DEAE-PEG and catalase formed an ion complex, that is, a
protein mono-ion complex (MIC). The formation of the protein MIC was
confirmed by native poly(acrylamide) gel electrophoresis and gel-filtration
chromatography. The resulting catalase MIC preserved the catalase
activity, confirmed by monitoring the O2 concentration
with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, in spite of MIC formation. The
catalase activity of the protein MIC was protected in the presence
of a protease, trypsin, or 10% fetal bovine serum. Furthermore, less
change in the circular dichroism measurements of the catalase MIC
was observed as compared to those of a catalase–PEG conjugate
(covalent PEGylation), suggesting less influence of the protein conformation.
Consequently, the formation of the MIC is considered to be a facile
method of protein PEGylation.

==== Body
Introduction
Protein PEGylation
is the process of attaching one or many poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) chains to a protein by chemical modification via covalent
bonding.1 PEGylation is progressing in
the field of biomaterial as well as polymer chemistry and is applied
for the pharmacokinetics of the target molecule to enhance its half-life
in the blood by the stealth property of PEG.2−4 The formation of covalent
bonds for PEGylation is well-known.5−9 Common chemical modifications of the amino groups of proteins,10 and site-selective PEGylation to the N-terminal
amino group,11 two thiol groups in the
protein disulfide bridge,12 or unnatural
amino acids inserted by fused protein13 have widely been reported. However, any covalent PEGylation affects
the primary structure of the proteins. A few noncovalent PEGylation mechanisms
have also been reported, that is, through hydrophobic interactions14,15 or coordination complex formation,16 as
well as through recently discovered unique methods.17−19

Recently,
we have established the concept of “mono-ion complex”
(MIC) formation with plasmid DNA (pDNA) by monocationic PEG for in
vivo diffusive gene delivery.20,21 The pDNA MIC is formed
between a phosphate group of pDNA and only one terminal cationic group
of the PEG chain. These studies have led us to prepare “protein
MIC” using monocationic PEG. The resulting protein MIC
is expected to be used for the facile method of protein PEGylation.
In this study, we have chosen catalase (molecular weight = 230 kDa;
pI = 6.0–6.2) as the protein. This article described the synthesis
of a new monocationic PEG, MIC formation between a protein and the
monocationic PEG, the effect of the resulting MIC formation on the
protein structure and its enzymatic activity, and the stability of
the MIC in the presence of protease or fetal bovine serum (FBS); detailed
studies on the mechanism of MIC formation are outside the scope of
the present study.

Results and Discussion
MIC Formation between Diethylaminoethyl
End-Modified PEG (DEAE-PEG)
and Catalase
To form an MIC with the carboxyl group of a protein,
we have synthesized DEAE-PEG. As shown in Figure 1, to synthesize DEAE-PEG, the carboxyl group
of 3-(diethylamino)propionic acid was activated in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The
active ester was then reacted with aminopropyl PEG, resulting in DEAE-PEG.
The 1H NMR spectrum of DEAE-PEG showed characteristic chemical
shifts derived from a diethylaminoethyl group (6H, terminal methyl
protons) and propyl PEG (3H, terminal methoxy protons) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)).
The yield is 46%. Thus, we succeeded in synthesizing DEAE-PEG.

Figure 1 Synthesis scheme
of DEAE-PEG.

To examine whether the
resulting DEAE-PEG formed an MIC with catalase,
as shown in Figure 2, we performed native poly(acrylamide) gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE).
In the presence of DEAE-PEG, a band with a high molecular weight appeared.
The intensity of the bands that appeared depended on the mixing amount
of DEAE-PEG. The bands that appeared were not observed when DEAE-PEG
and catalase were mixed under salt conditions (in PBS(−) and
not in H2O; results not shown). From these results, although
further confirmation is necessary, it was postulated that MIC formation
between DEAE-PEG and catalase may occur.

DEAE-PEG (5–100 μg). M, protein molecular weight marker.

Furthermore, to confirm the MIC formation of catalase with DEAE-PEG, we carried out gel-filtration
chromatography (GFC) of the sample that showed the highest band intensity
in Figure 2. As shown
in Figure 3, although
the main elution time seems to be indistinguishable, the GFC profile
of catalase in the presence of DEAE-PEG was obtained earlier than
that in the presence of catalase alone. Especially, earlier elution
from 6.8 to 7.2 min appeared. Taking these results into account, we
have succeeded in the formation of an MIC with catalase using DEAE-PEG,
that is, in “protein PEGylation by MIC”.

line) and presence (solid line) of DEAE-PEG. Detection; refractive
index (RI).

Catalytic Activity of the
Catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC
Despite
PEGylation by the MIC, the resulting catalase should preserve its
enzyme activity. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4, we measured the catalase activity of the
resulting catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC. The concentration of O2, which was produced from H2O2 by the catalase
reaction, was monitored in the solution of the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC.
The O2-production profile of the MIC was almost the same
as that of native catalase as well as a catalase–PEG conjugate.
According to this result, PEGylation by the MIC preserved the catalase
activity.

Figure 4 Time-course of O2 production from H2O2 catalyzed by the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC (closed circle), native
catalase (open square), and catalase–PEG conjugate (gray triangle)
in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). O2 production was compared
at the same concentration of catalase (100 μg/mL).

To examine the stability of the resulting catalase/DEAE-PEG
MIC
for in vivo administration, as shown in Figure 5, we monitored the O2 production
by the MIC in the presence of a protease, trypsin. O2 production
of the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC was the almost same as that of the catalase–PEG
conjugate and was higher than that of native catalase in the presence
of trypsin. Because the O2-production profile of the MIC
was the almost same as that of native catalase in the absence of trypsin
(Figure 4), the decrease
in the O2 production of native catalase in the presence
of trypsin is considered to be due to the digestion of catalase by
trypsin. Furthermore, from native-PAGE analysis, the band of the catalase/DEAE-PEG
MIC, as well as that of the catalase–PEG conjugate, was preserved
in the presence of trypsin, although the band of native catalase was
weakened (see Figure S2). On the basis
of these results, the catalase in the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC as well
as in the catalase–PEG conjugate is considered to be protected
from digestion by trypsin. In addition, in the presence of 10% FBS,
the O2-production profile of the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC
was the almost same as that of the catalase–PEG conjugate and
was higher than that of native catalase (Figure 6). Collectively, these results indicate that
PEGylation by MIC is the facile method for protection of proteins
from digestion by proteases.

H2O2 catalyzed by the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC
(closed circle), native
catalase (open square), and catalase–PEG conjugate (gray triangle)
in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of trypsin. O2 production was compared at the same concentration of catalase
(100 μg/mL).

catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC (closed circle), native
catalase (open square), and catalase–PEG conjugate (gray triangle)
in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of 10% FBS. O2 production was compared at the same concentration of catalase
(100 μg/mL).

Finally, as shown in Figure 7, we examined the
effect of MIC formation on the conformation
of catalase by circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The CD spectrum
of the catalase/DEAE-PEG MIC was almost the same as that of native
catalase (Figure 7A).
Conversely, the CD spectrum of the catalase–PEG conjugate was
especially disordered from 250 to 280 nm (near-ultraviolet) as compared
to that of native catalase (Figure 7B). The disordered near-ultraviolet CD spectrum may
be attributed to the induced interaction of aromatic side chains.22 Hence, although a recent crystal structure of
a PEGylated protein demonstrates that the protein structure was not
affected by the PEG,23 the covalent PEGylation
is considered to affect the conformation of the protein in aqueous
solution as well as the primary structure.

Figure 7 CD spectra of native
catalase (dashed line), (A) the catalase/DEAE-PEG
MIC (solid line), and (B) the catalase–PEG conjugate (dotted
line).

Furthermore, in the presence of
DEAE-PEG, the CD spectrum of a
typical polypeptide with carboxyl groups, poly(l-glutamic
acid), showed a helix-characteristic CD band (Figure S3).24 Meanwhile, in the
absence of DEAE-PEG, the CD spectrum of poly(l-glutamic acid)
showed a CD band from the polypeptide chain in a random coil (Figure S3).23 The
difference in the CD spectra is direct evidence of the ionic interaction
between the DEAE group of DEAE-PEG and the carboxyl group of poly(l-glutamic acid). Hence, the DEAE group of DEAE-PEG is considered
to interact with the carboxyl group of catalase.

Conclusions
DEAE-PEG has been synthesized for the noncovalent PEGylation of
proteins. The resulting DEAE-PEG and catalase formed a protein MIC.
The resulting catalase MIC preserved the catalase activity despite
MIC formation. The catalase activity of the protein MIC was protected
in the presence of a protease, trypsin, or 10% FBS. Furthermore, as
compared with the catalase–PEG conjugate (covalent PEGylation),
the catalase MIC is less influenced by protein conformation. Consequently,
the formation of an MIC is considered to be a facile method of protein
PEGylation.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aminopropyl PEG (weight-average
molecular
weight, Mw = 2000 g mol–1) was purchased from NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). 3-(Diethylamino)propionic
acid hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (St.
Louis, MO). All other chemicals were of special grade and were used
without further purification.

Synthesis of DEAE-PEG
The typical procedure is as follows
(Figure 2): 3-(Diethylamino)propionic
acid hydrochloride (154 mg, 1.0 mmol), NHS (115 mg, 1.0 mmol), and
DCC (206 mg, 1.0 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of DMF in the presence
of 140 μL (1.0 mmol) of triethylamine (TEA) and incubated at
50 °C for 16 h. After incubation, aminopropyl PEG (400 mg, 0.2
mmol) was added to the resulting mixture and further incubated at
50 °C for 24 h. Then, 2.4 mL of DMF, in which
3-(diethylamino)propionic acid hydrochloride (50.4 mg, 0.4 mmol),
NHS (40 mg, 0.4 mmol), DCC (82.5 mg, 0.4 mmol), and TEA (55.8 μL,
0.4 mmol) were incubated at 50 °C for 16 h, was added to the
resulting mixture containing aminopropyl PEG, and it was further incubated
at 50 °C for 24 h, followed by drying in vacuo. The resulting
sample was dialyzed against distilled water using the Spectra/Por
Biotech cellulose ester membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 100–500 Da) and then freeze-dried.
Next, the resulting sample was solubilized in chloroform and filtered.
The filtrate was dried in vacuo. The resulting sample (DEAE-PEG) was
dialyzed against distilled water again, followed by freeze-drying.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
The polymer (6 mg) was
dissolved in 700 μL of D2O (99.8 atom % deuterium;
Acros, NJ). 1H NMR spectra (500 MHz) were obtained on a
Bruker AV500 spectrometer (Billerica, MA).

Native-PAGE
Various
amounts of DEAE-PEG (5–100
μg, 2.4–48 nmol) and catalase (5 μg, 0.02 nmol)
were mixed in 18 μL of H2O. The resulting mixture,
as well as free catalase (no PEG), was incubated at 37 °C for
24 h, followed by freeze-drying. Then, 18 μL of PBS(−)
was added to the dried sample, mixed with loading buffer (2 μL),
and loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide gel. The prepared gel was run using
buffer (pH 8.3) comprising 50 mM Tris and 38 mM glycine. Electrophoresis
was performed at room temperature for 1 h, and the current was kept
at 20 mA. Coomassie brilliant blue was used to observe the catalase-containing
bands. After washing with 7% acetic acid solution, the catalase-containing
bands were visualized.

GFC
DEAE-PEG (1000 μg, 480
nmol) and catalase
(50 μg, 0.2 nmol) were mixed in 180 μL of H2O. The resulting mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, followed
by freeze-drying. Then, 250 μL of PBS(−) was added to
the dried sample. GFC was carried out using a JASCO PU-980 pumping
system (Tokyo, Japan) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with a Shodex OHpak
SB-804 HQ column (Showa Denko K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The aqueous solution
containing PBS(−) was used as the mobile phase. The resulting
samples in PBS(−) (100μL) were injected into the column.
The eluate was detected with a RI detector (RI-1530; Jasco).

Measurement
of Catalase Activity
DEAE-PEG (100 μg)
and catalase (5 μg) were mixed in 18 μL of H2O. For the synthesis of a catalase–PEG conjugate, monomethoxy-NHS-activated
ester/carbonate-PEG (100 μg) and catalase (5 μg) were
mixed in 18 μL of H2O. The resulting mixture was
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by freeze-drying. The resulting
sample was dissolved in 900 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH
7.4), followed by mixing with 100 μL of 10 mM H2O2 in the absence or presence of 2.5 mg/mL trypsin or 10% FBS.
Then, the catalase activity was measured by monitoring the O2 concentration with a Clark-type oxygen electrode.

CD Measurements
DEAE-PEG (100 μg) and catalase
(50 μg) were mixed in 180 μL of H2O. For the
synthesis of a catalase–PEG conjugate, monomethoxy-NHS-activated
ester/carbonate-PEG (100 μg) and catalase (50 μg) were
mixed in 18 μL of H2O. The resulting mixture was
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by freeze-drying. The final
concentration of catalase was adjusted to 50 μg/mL (0.2 μM).
The CD spectrum of the resulting sample was measured with a Jasco
J-820 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan).
