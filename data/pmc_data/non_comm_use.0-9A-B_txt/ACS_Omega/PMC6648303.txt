We have recently reported that hydride
(H–) doped
superatom (HPd@Au8)+ protected by eight PPh3 ligands selectively grew into (HPd@Au10)3+ by the nucleophilic addition of two Au(I)Cl units. In the present
study, (HPd@Au8)+ was successfully converted
to unprecedented trimetallic (HPd@M2Au8)3+ superatoms (M = Ag, Cu) by controlled doping of two Ag(I)Cl
or Cu(I)Cl units, respectively. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
demonstrated that two Ag(I) or Cu(I) ions were regioselectively incorporated.
Theoretical calculations suggested that hydrogens in (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M = Au, Ag, Cu) occupy the same bridging
site between the central Pd atom and the surface Au atom. (HPd@Ag2Au8)3+ exhibited photoluminescence at
775 nm, with the enhanced quantum yield of 0.09%, although it is structurally
and electronically equivalent with (HPd@Au10)3+. This study demonstrates that hydride-mediated growth process is
a promising atomically-precise bottom-up synthetic method of new multimetallic
superatoms.

Introduction
Gold clusters protected
by ligands have gained much interest as
promising building units of functional nanoscale materials because
of their size-specific properties.1−6 Recent progress in atomically precise synthesis has revealed that
their physicochemical properties can be tuned dramatically not only
by the number of constituent atoms of the core but also by doping
foreign atoms.7−20 For instance, optical properties15,19 and catalytic
activities7 of thiolate (RS) protected
Au25(SR)18 cluster are modulated significantly
by doping heterometal atoms. To establish the correlation between
structure and functionalities of protected gold clusters, it is required
to control precisely not only the chemical compositions but also the
location of dopant atoms.

Co-reduction of gold and dopant metal
precursor ions has been used
frequently as a straightforward method to synthesize doped gold clusters.
However, it is still a challenge to obtain the doped clusters with
the desired composition in high yield due to the difference in the
relative reduction rates of the precursor metal ions. To circumvent
the difficulties, other methods such as galvanic and antigalvanic
methods have been developed.12,13,17,19,21−23 Tri- and tetrametallic clusters have been synthesized
by antigalvanic processes between preformed bimetallic clusters and
heterometal complexes24−26 and reduction of heterometal precursors in the presence
of preformed bimetallic clusters.27−30

Recently, we reported controlled
growth of phosphine-protected
oblate gold-based clusters, [Au9(PPh3)8]3+ and [PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+, to spherical clusters, [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ and [HPdAu10(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (1),
respectively.31−33 This growth is initiated by the activation of [Au9(PPh3)8]3+ and [PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+ through doping
of an H– anion to form [HAu9(PPh3)8]2+ and [HPdAu8(PPh3)8]+, respectively. This step is followed
by sequential nucleophilic attack of the hydride-doped clusters to
AuCl(PPh3) complex. The number of AuCl units incorporated
into [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ and [HPdAu10(PPh3)8Cl2]+ was limited to two because of the steric hindrance
of the ligand layers. Hydride is released in the form of proton during
the formation of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+, whereas the H atom remained in 1 due to the high affinity of hydrogen to palladium.32,33

The aim of the present study is to apply the hydride-mediated
growth
reaction for heterometal doping reaction. Unprecedented trimetallic
clusters [HPdAg2Au8(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (2) and [HPdCu2Au8(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (3) were obtained by reacting the hydride-doped [HPdAu8(PPh3)8]+ with silver(I)
and copper(I) complexes, AgCl(PPh3) and CuCl(PPh3), respectively. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography of 2 and 3 revealed that two MCl (M = Ag, Cu) units occupy
the structurally equivalent sites. Theoretical calculations on model
systems [HPdM2Au8(PMe3)8Cl2]+ (M = Ag, Cu) predicted the formation
of superatomic cores (HPd@M2Au8)3+ in which the H atom is located at the bridging site of the central
Pd and surface Au atoms. The core structure of 2 was
quantitatively similar to that of 1, whereas that of 3 was slightly deformed due to the smaller size of Cu than
that of Au and Ag. Nevertheless, 1–3 exhibited similar optical spectra in the onset region, indicating
that the replacement of two coinage atoms in (HPd@M2Au8)3+ does not affect the superatomic orbitals. The
doped superatoms (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M
= Ag, Cu) showed photoluminescence (PL), whereas the undoped (HPd@Au10)3+ did not. This study not only provides new
superatoms but also demonstrates that hydride-mediated process is
a promising atomically precise bottom-up method to synthesize multielement
superatoms.

Results and Discussion
Doping of Ag or Cu was conducted
by adding a dichloromethane (DCM)
solution of 3 equiv of AgCl(PPh3) or CuCl(PPh3) to an ethanol–tetrahydrofuran (EtOH–THF) solution
of [HPdAu8(PPh3)8]+ that
was prepared following the reported method.32 Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra of the reaction mixtures
indicated that the main products were 2 and 3, respectively (Figure 1a,b). Thus, the doping reactions are expressed as follows 1   2  In
situ Ag K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
structure analysis during eq 1 showed that the spectral feature of Ag(I) disappeared and
the metallic feature appeared within 20 min (Figure S1). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the reaction mixtures
showed that the incorporation of two MCl units (M = Ag, Cu) was completed
within 2 h, much faster than that of AuCl units (∼4 h). The 31P{1H} NMR chart for 2 (Figure 1c) exhibits a triplet signal,
indicating that eight phosphorus nuclei of the PPh3 ligands
couple with two silver atoms equivalently on the NMR time scale. The
average coupling constant 3J(31P–Ag) was 19.6 Hz, whereas the coupling constant of 31P–105Ag and 31P–107Ag could not be determined. Although [HPdAgAu9(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (2′) and [HPdCuAu9(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (3′) were detected as byproducts
in the ESI mass spectra (Figure 1a,b), the 31P{1H} NMR charts
suggest that their actual populations are smaller than expected from
the relative intensities of the mass peaks: no peak assignable to 2′ was observed in Figure 1c, and the population of 3′ is less than 15% from Figure 1d.

patterns. 2′ and 3′ are assigned

To confirm that the doping of hydride (H–) to
[PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+ is indispensable
for the doping of Ag or Cu (eqs 1 and 2), we monitored the reactions
between [PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+ and MCl(PPh3) (M = Ag, Cu) (for details, see the Supporting Information). The ESI mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) showed that the peak intensity of [PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+ drastically decreased just after
the addition of MCl(PPh3) and that a new peak of [Au(PPh3)2]+ appeared (Figure S2). Formation of 2 or 3 was not
observed even after 2 h by ESI-MS and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectroscopy (Figure S3). These
results indicate that [PdAu8(PPh3)8]2+ does not undergo nucleophilic attack to MCl(PPh3) without predoping of H–.

We also
examined whether 2 and 3 are
produced by the co-reduction of metal precursors, since the synthesis
of 1 by the co-reduction method was reported previously.34 The mixture of Pd(PPh3)4, AuCl(PPh3), and MCl(PPh3) with a molar ratio
of 1:8:3 was reduced by sodium borohydride in EtOH (for details, see
the Supporting Information). ESI-MS of
the products (Figure S4) showed that 2 was formed as a minor species when M = Ag, whereas 3 was not generated when M = Cu. Therefore, the simple co-reduction
method is not efficient for the synthesis of trimetallic clusters 2 and 3, whereas the hydride-mediated doping
processes via eqs 1 and 2 are an effective method.

Figure 2a,c represents
the geometric structures of 2 and 3, respectively,
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. In
both clusters, Pd atom occupies the central position and two MCl units
are incorporated at the surface to form nearly spherical superatomic
cores, as in the case of [HPdAu10(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (1) (Figure S5). The occupancy of Cu in the core (1.68/2.00)
of 3 was consistent with the purity estimated from the 31P{1H} NMR chart (Figure 1d). However, the position of the doped H
atom could not be determined by SCXRD analysis because of its weak
scattering power. Figure 2a,c shows that one of the Au–Au surface bonds of 2 (3.89 Å) or 3 (3.91 Å) was significantly
longer than the corresponding Au–Au bond in [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (3.11 Å).35 This deformation of the core was also observed
in 1 and is ascribed to the location of H atom near the
central Pd atom.32 To identify the location
of the “invisible” H atom in 2 and 3, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was conducted
on the model systems [HPdAg2Au8(PMe3)8Cl2]+ (2m) and [HPdCu2Au8(PMe3)8Cl2]+ (3m) using the B3LYP functional. Basis sets
used were LanL2dz and 6-31G(d) for metal atoms and others, respectively.
Two isomers (2m-a and 2m-b) and (3m-a and 3m-b) with comparable stability were obtained as
optimized structures of 2m and 3m (Figure 2b,d), respectively.
The H atoms in these isomers were located at the bridging site between
the central Pd atom and the surface AuPPh3 unit or the
surface MCl unit. The elongated Au–Au bonds in 2 and 3 were not reproduced by the less stable isomers
of 2m-b (3.07 Å) and 3m-b (3.10 Å)
but by the more stable isomers 2m-a (4.09 Å) and 3m-a (3.99 Å). Thus, we conclude that the invisible H
atoms in 2 and 3 are most likely located
at the bridging site between the central Pd atom and the surface Au
atom.

Figure 3a compares
the structures of the metallic cores of 1–3. The locations of the two doped MCl units are the same for 1, 2, and 3, indicating that the
introduction of two MCl units proceeded regioselectively regardless
of M. The occupancy analysis of Au and M in 2 and 3 showed that M dopants are always bonded to the Cl ligands
without any scrambling with Au atoms. These results suggest that 1 has two identical preferential doping sites regardless of
M. The occupation of identical sites by four MCl units (M = Au, Ag,
Cu) was also reported in [Au9M4(PR3)8Cl4]+.36 These doping modes are in sharp contrast to that found in doping
to [Au25(SR)18]− where Ag
and Cu dopants occupy different sites.37,38 The number
and location of the doped MCl units are probably determined by the
packing structure of the ligand layer. Although the crystal structures
of 1, 2, and 3 were similar,
the bond lengths around the MCl units varied depending on the doped
metals. The distributions of the bond lengths between the M atom and
the adjacent Au and Pd atoms are shown by the histograms in Figure 3b. The histograms
indicate that the Cu–Au/Pd bonds of 3 are shorter
than the corresponding Ag– and Au–Au/Pd bonds of 1 and 2, respectively. The shortening of the
Cu–metal bonds of 3 is consistent with the smaller
van der Waals radius of Cu compared to those of Au and Ag (Au: 1.66
Å, Ag: 1.72 Å, Cu: 1.40 Å). In contrast, the other
metal–metal bond lengths hardly vary (Figure S6).

The cores of the reaction products 1–3, (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M = Ag,
Ag, Cu), and the precursor, (HPd@Au8)+, are
all viewed as electronically closed superatoms with an electronic
configuration of (1S)2(1P)6. This simple picture
is supported by optical spectroscopy. Figure 3c demonstrates that the spectral profiles
of 1–3 and [HPdAu8(PPh3)8]+ are similar in the wavelength region
of >400 nm: a broad band with an optical onset in the range of
600–700
nm. This observation suggests that the electronic structures of (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M = Au, Ag, Cu) and (HPd@Au8)+ are similar, since the optical absorption in
the onset region is governed by optical transitions that involve occupied
1P and unoccupied 1D orbitals. The similarity of electronic structures
of 1–3 is confirmed by those calculated
for the corresponding model systems, 1m,322m-a, and 3m-a. Figure S7 shows that the energy gaps between the 1P and 1D
orbitals are comparable, although the 1P orbitals of 2m-a and 3m-a are less degenerated than those of 1m. Two features are discernible from the natural population analysis
of 1m, 2m-a, and 3m-a (Figure S8). First, the natural bond orbitals
(NBOs) charges on Ag and Cu dopants are larger than those of the corresponding
Au atoms, indicating that the charge distribution in superatomic cores
are affected by doping. Second, the NBO charge on both the H and peripheral
Au atoms is almost neutral, indicating that the H atom contributes
its 1s electron to the superatomic electron count. These results indicate
that the superatomic orbitals of (HPd@M2Au8)3+ are not appreciably affected by the dopant M, although the
geometric structure and charge distribution are slightly affected.
In contrast, the spectral profile of 3 is significantly
different from those of 1 and 2 in the wavelength
region of <400 nm: the characteristic peaks at ∼310 nm in 1 and 2 are smeared out in 3. This
difference may originate from that of the quasi-bands, composed of
d orbitals of metal atoms and located below the 1P orbitals (Figure S7).

Although the electronic structures
of 1–3 were similar in terms of photoabsorption,
doped clusters 2 and 3 exhibit PL, whereas
undoped cluster 1 did not. Figure 4 shows the PL spectra of 2 and 3 in DCM and their excitation spectra at 775 nm. The Stokes
shifts
for 2 and 3 were 0.69 and 0.35 eV, respectively.
The PL quantum yields (QYs) were 9 × 10–4 and
4 × 10–5 for 2 and 3, respectively. Given that the PL QY of 1 is below ∼1
× 10–7, the replacement of AuCl units in 1 with AgCl units remarkably enhanced the PL QY. Although
the detailed mechanism of the emergence of PL induced by Ag doping
is not clear at this moment, the superatoms 1–3 provide an ideal platform to study the origin of the doping
effect on their photophysical properties.

(dotted line) spectra of 1, 2, and 3 in DCM. PL spectra were excited
at 542 nm (1, 2) and 635 nm (3). UV–vis
absorption spectra of 2 and 3 are shown
as black lines.

Conclusions
In
summary, new trimetallic superatoms (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M = Ag, Cu) were synthesized by regioselective
doping of two M(I) units to a hydride-doped superatom (HPd@Au8)+. It is proposed that the number and location
of the MCl units doped are determined by the packing structure of
the ligand layer. The structure of (HPd@Ag2Au8)3+ was quantitatively similar to that of (HPd@Au10)3+, whereas that of (HPd@Cu2Au8)3+ is slightly deformed, reflecting the smaller
size of Cu than Au and Ag. The superatomic orbitals in (HPd@M2Au8)3+ (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are not affected
with M appreciably, as revealed by similar optical spectra in the
low-energy region. The photoluminescence quantum yields depend significantly
on dopant M and decrease in the order of M = Ag > Cu > Au. This
study
illustrates the general scope of the chemical reactivity of hydride-doped
superatom and will provide a novel bottom-up, atomically precise synthesis
of novel multimetallic superatoms.

respectively.41 [PdAu8(PPh3)8](NO3)2 and [HPdAu10(PPh3)Cl2](Cl, NO3) (1) were synthesized according to the literature.32

General
1H (400 MHz)
and 31P{1H} (162 MHz) NMR charts were recorded
on a JEOL JNM-ECS400
spectrometer. All NMR experiments were conducted at 298 K. Chemical
shifts in the 1H NMR charts were referenced to the residual
proton signal of the solvent (CD2Cl2: δ
5.32). Chemical shifts in the 31P{1H} NMR charts
were referenced to 85% H3PO4 (δ 0.00)
as an external standard. Positive-mode ESI mass spectra were recorded
on a JEOL JMS-T100LC time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A sample solution
was directly infused at a flow rate of 3.0 mL/h using a syringe pump.
Typical parameters for the measurements were as follows: spray voltage
2.5 kV; ring electrode: 45 V; orifice 1 voltage: 40 V; orifice 2 voltage:
0 V; desolvation temperature 120 °C; cone temperature 80 °C.
The spectra were calibrated using [Cs(CsI)n]+ clusters as an external reference, generated from a
99% aqueous methanol solution of CsI (0.5 mg/mL) under the same parameters.
The isotope patterns were calculated by mMass software.42 UV–vis absorption spectra were measured
using a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette.
PL and excitation spectra were measured by a JASCO FP-6600 spectrofluorometer
with a 1 cm quartz cuvette. The measurements were conducted in degassed
solvents at ambient temperature. The QYs were determined by comparison
with that of rhodamine B reported (0.97) in EtOH.43

Synthesis of [HPdAg2Au8(PPh3)8Cl2](Cl, NO3)
(2)
A 15 mL screw-capped test tube equipped
with a magnetic stir bar
was charged with [PdAu8(PPh3)8](NO3)2 (39 mg, 10 μmol). EtOH (1 mL) was added
to the tube and stirring was started. The stirred solution was diluted
with THF (10 mL) to obtain a homogeneous red solution. To the stirring
solution was successively added a freshly prepared 0.10 M EtOH solution
of NaBH4 (100 μL; 0.38 mg) and a DCM solution of
AgCl(PPh3) (12.2 mg, 30 μmol in 1 mL). The tube was
wrapped in an aluminum foil and the reaction was monitored by TLC
(DCM/methanol = 6:1). After stirring for 2 h, the solution was poured
into hexane (60 mL) through a cotton plug, affording a brown precipitate.
The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then rinsed three
times with hexane. After drying in vacuo, Ar-saturated DCM (∼5
mL) was added to the precipitate and filtered by a cotton plug. Then,
Ar-saturated n-pentane (∼20 mL) was added
to the filtrate to form a turbid solution, which was left to stand
overnight under dark conditions. Cluster 2 was obtained
as dark red crystals. Yield: 18.1 mg (44% based on Pd). The product
was stored at −20 °C in the dark. Crystals for SCXRD analysis
were obtained by recrystallization in DCM/diisopropyl ether. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD2Cl2) δ: 7.22–7.35
(m(br), 48H), 6.92–7.00 (m, 24H), 6.65–6.74 (t, 48H); 31P{1H} NMR (162 MHz, CD2Cl2) δ: 50.5 (t).

Synthesis of [HPdCu2Au8(PPh3)8Cl2](Cl, NO3)
(3)
The synthesis of 3 was conducted
by a similar procedure
to that of 2 by using a DCM solution of CuCl(PPh3) (10.8 mg, 30 μmol in 1 mL) instead of AgCl(PPh3). The reaction and recrystallization were conducted under
ambient light and an Ar atmosphere. Cluster 3 was obtained
as red crystals. Yield: 31.1 mg (77% based on Pd). The product was
stored at −20 °C under an Ar atmosphere. 1H
NMR (400 MHz, CD2Cl2) δ: 7.34 (t(br),
48H), 6.94 (t, 24H), 6.65 (t, 48H); 31P{1H}
NMR (162 MHz, CD2Cl2) δ: 50.7 (s).
