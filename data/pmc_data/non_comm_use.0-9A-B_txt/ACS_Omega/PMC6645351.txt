Polymer-derived
silicon carbonitride (SiCN) materials have been
synthesized via pyrolyzing from five poly(silylcarbondiimide)s with
different contents of carbon (labeled as 1–5#). The morphological
and structural measurements show that the SiCN materials are mixtures
of nanocrystals of SiC, Si3N4, and graphite.
The SiCN materials have been used as anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
Among the five polymer-derived SiCN materials, 5#SiCN, derived from
dichloromethylvinylsilane and di-n-octyldichlorosilane,
has the best cycle stability and a high-rate performance at the low
cutoff voltage of 0.01–1.0 V. In lithium-ion half-cells, the
specific delithiation capacity of 5#SiCN anode still remains at 826.7
mA h g–1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles; it can
even deliver the capacity above 550 mA h g–1 at
high current densities of 1.6 and 2 A g–1. In lithium-ion
full cells, 5#SiCN anode works well with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 commercial cathode. The outstanding
electrochemical performance of 5#SiCN anode is attributed to two factors:
(1) the formation of a stable and compact solid electrolyte interface
layer on the anode surface anode, which protects the electrode from
cracking during the charge/discharge cycle; and (2) a large amount
of carbon component and the less Si3N4 phase
in the 5#SiCN structure, which provides an electrochemical reactive
and conductive environment in the SiCN structure, benefit the lithiation/delithiation
process. In addition, we explore the reason for the capacity fading
of these SiCN anodes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As
one of the promising candidate for new energy storage devices,
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have received considerable attention
and have been widely applied in portable devices and power tools such
as electric equipment and electric/hybrid vehicles because they can
potentially fulfill the requirements of high energy density, high
efficiency, and low emission simultaneously.1−3 Nevertheless,
the conventional graphite anode is characterized by low capacity (372
mA h g–1 in theory) and low kinetics at a high charge/discharge
rate, which is unable to achieve the increasing requirement for LIBs
with higher capacity and better rate performance in high-energy and
high-power density applications.4,5

Polymer-derived
silicon carbonitride (SiCN) materials have emerged
as one of the promising alternative anode materials in the last decade.6,7 They are prepared by the pyrolysis of organic polymers containing
Si, H, C, and N in an inert atmosphere at 1000–1600 °C.
After organic–inorganic transition in the pyrolysis, amorphous
SiCN structure, which consists of graphene-like carbon chains wrapped
around nanosized domains of silicon nitride and silicon carbide, is
obtained. SiCN has unique Si–C, Si–N, and Si–C–N
network structures with embedded numerous dangling bonds of silicon,
free carbon (amorphous carbon), and graphene sheets. Lithium ion can
bond with those silicon and carbon atoms to deliver a high reversible
capacity of 400–800 mA h g–1, which is better
than that of the current graphite anodes.8−12 Sanchez-Jimenez et al. reported that the silicon-based
mixed bond of silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) in a tetrahedra sequesters
an equivalent of ∼50 000 mA h g–1-atom,
whereas “free carbon” can sequester ∼5000 mA
h g–1-atom for the reversible portion of the lithium
insertion.13 Additionally, Fukui et al.
confirmed by 7Li NMR that the Si–O–C composite
material electrochemically stores lithium species in interstitial
spaces or edges of the graphene layers, the Si–O–C glass
phase, and the micropores.14 These SiOC
materials have a similar structure as our SiCN materials,6,7 which suggests the big potential for the high reversible capacity
of our SiCN materials.

Although the SiCN anode has many advantages
for lithium-ion battery,
its irreversible capacity in the first few cycles is low (40–50%)
due to its low electrical conductivity and the volume expansion during
charge–discharge cycle.15,16 To resolve this issue,
increasing the carbon content in the SiCN matrix is an efficient way
to improve the integral conductivity of SiCN. Two strategies have
been implemented to improve the carbon content in SiCN: first, coat
or incorporate carbon materials; second, use carbon-rich polymer for
pyrolysis. In previous work, our group has incorporated carbon materials
such as graphite,17 carbon nanotubes,18 and graphene19 into
SiCN. With increasing carbon content in the SiCN/carbon composites,
the cycle stability and high rate performance have been dramatically
improved by 2–6 times. In addition, the same results have been
found by other research groups.20−24 The latter strategies employ a carbon-rich preceramic derivation
such as polyphenylvinylsilylcarbodiimide,25−28 polyphenylvinylsilazane,29,30 and divinylbenzene31,32 as the precursors for pyrolysis.
Due to the high carbon content in the precursor, the final products
can exhibit a high carbon content. Nevertheless, there are significant
differences between the two strategies. The former needs at least
two steps: pyrolysis of polymer to obtain SiCN followed by another
heat treatment to incorporate carbon materials in SiCN. The latter
is easier and more beneficial because all of the preparations are
in one step in which the achievement of a carbon-rich preceramic polymer
is an important factor.

Herein, we adopt carbon-rich polymer
precursors with different
carbon containing to fabricate SiCN materials and then test the electrochemical
performances of these SiCN anodes both in lithium-ion half cells and
full cells. Moreover, we further explore the reason for the capacity
fading of these SiCN anodes. With different element contents of silicon,
carbon, and nitrogen in the final products, the SiCN material would
show different nanosized domains in the matrix, which effects their
electrochemical performances. The purpose of this work is to investigate
the carbon contribution in SiCN material for reversible lithiation/delithiation
process, accordingly we can illustrate the inter-relation between
the polymer and the final SiCN material to further optimize the carbon-rich
SiCN structure for excellent electrochemical performance.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Morphology
The detailed
syntheses of 1–5#SiCN materials are given in Experimental Section. Figure 1a shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis
of the cross-linked SiCN polymer precursor. As indicated by the TGA curves, the weight loss observed
below 250 °C most likely corresponds to the loss of water due
to desorption of physically absorbed water on the materials.33,34 The different weight losses in the five cross-linked SiCN polymers,
poly(silylcarbondiimide), at the temperature interval of 250–800
°C indicate the different decomposition statues due to the variety
of organic groups and the carbon framework from the five polymers.
In the pyrolysis process, the polymer precursors are transformed from
organic phase to inorganic phase.35,36 For our polymer
samples, all of the polymers changed into inorganic compounds at the
temperature above 800 °C. The different phase transformation
at the temperature 250–600 °C may cause a different chemical
composition in the resulting SiCN products. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
was employed to further investigate the structure of SiCN materials
after pyrolysis, as shown in Figure 1b. As shown in the XRD patterns, the diffraction peaks
of five SiCN samples are broad, suggesting amorphous structures. Because
these large amounts of amorphous phases may be covered by the low
nanocrystals in the SiCN structures, we cannot ensure the specific
structures of the SiCN samples. To solve the issues, the following
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis are carried out for further investigation.

XRD patterns of the 1–5#SiCN materials after pyrolysis.

Figure 2a shows
the FTIR spectra of 1–5#SiCN polymer precursors after 80 °C
cross-linking. As shown, the five SiCN polymers consist of many organic
groups such as −OH, N–H, Si–H, Si–N, Si–C,
and Si–CH=CH2. It is noted that the number
and IR intensity of organic groups depend on the characteristics and
constituents of different polymers. To further explore, we choose
two polymers, 1# and 5#SiCN, as examples to investigate their FTIR
spectra before and after 80 °C cross-linking and after 1000 °C
pyrolysis, as shown in Figure 2b,c, respectively. As shown in Figure 2b, before cross-linking, the 1#SiCN precursor
has many organic groups, including −OH, N–H, Si–H,
Si–CH=CH2, Si–CH3, −CH=CH2, Si–N, and Si–C. During the cross-linking process,
the breakage of double bonds of Si–CH=CH2 and −CH=CH2 indicated that the organic
monomers were transferred into polymers. In the following pyrolytic
process, the polymer was transferred into a ceramic, which involved
the breaking of Si–CH3 and C–H bonds. This
transformation was clearly recorded in the FTIR spectra, with a decrease
in the intensity of the corresponding peaks. Finally, the pyrolyzed
1#SiCN sample does not have any organic groups. The same phenomenon
was also found in 5#SiCN (Figure 3c), except that a small quantity of Si–CH=CH2 still existed in the sample, which indicated incomplete cross-linking
and pyrolysis. From Figure 2a, we can see that an increase in the amount of the double
bonds in polymers after cross-linking from sample 1–5 indicates
a decrease in the extent of cross-linking. This is due to an increase
in the molecular mass of the monomers involved in the cross-linking
process, leading to more difficulty in proceeding with the cross-linking
reaction.

spectra of 1–5#SiCN materials after 1000 °C pyrolysis.

and TEM
images (d–f) of 5#SiCN materials.

To further reveal the structure of 1–5#SiCN synthesized
from different carbon-containing polymers, the nature of the carbon
obtained in the SiCN samples is worth studying. We employ Raman spectroscopy
to reveal the graphitic and amorphous carbon content in the SiCN materials.
As shown in Figure 2d, the 1–5#SiCN materials show two major characteristic bands
in the Raman shift from 1200 to 1800 cm–1: the G
band at 1590 cm–1 and the D band at 1320 cm–1. It is known that the G band is the response of the
inplane stretching motion of the symmetric sp2 C–C
band, whereas the D band results from the disruption and defects of
the symmetrical hexagonal graphitic lattice. The increase in the intensity
ratio of D band and G band (ID/IG) from 1 to 5#SiCN (0.8621, 0.8917, 0.9421,
0.9552, and 0.9555) indicates a decrease in the size of sp2 domains and a increase in the defects in the graphitic lattice.
That is, the ratio of amorphous carbon increased in the relevant SiCN
products, whereas the content of graphitic carbon decreased in them,
with the initial carbon ratio increasing from 1 to 5# polymer precursor.

The morphologies of SiCN materials are characterized by SEM in Figure 3a–c. As shown
in Figures 3a and S2 of the Supporting Information, 1–5#SiCN
materials are composed of massive irregularly blocked particles with
dense and rigid surfaces. These particles are of nonuniform sizes
and distributed between 10 and 100 μm. In the enlarged SEM images
(Figure 4b,c), it is
clear that a lot of small particles are dispersed randomly on the
large particles. We analyzed five different areas of this small particles
in Figure 3b, which
are marked as numbers 1–5 in the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectrum. The EDX results are shown in Table 1. The EDX results based on areas 1–3
and 5 indicate that the most component of these small particles are
carbon, with slight amounts of silicon and chlorine. However, the
EDX result based on area 4 illustrated that the small particle can
be mixed substances of silicon nanocrystal and silicon chloride. Briefly,
all of the EDX results reveal that the small particles on the surface
of large particle in SiCN material are mainly carbon and silicon substances
without nitrogen ingredient.

g–1 (all in half-cells).

Materials by EDX Analysis
area number	Si/wt %	C/wt %	Cl/wt %

Because the EDX analysis of the 5#SiCN
material does not accurately
reflect the macroscopic carbon content in the whole composite, we
employ carbon analysis using a Vario El Cube analyzer. The carbon
analysis data are listed in Table 2. As shown, 5#SiCN has the highest carbon weight percentage
because the polymer precursor (raw reaction material) of 5#SiCN has
the highest carbon content. The carbon weight percentages increases
from 1 to 5#SiCN.

4#SiCN	17.73	4.81	1.48	
5#SiCN	49.15	1.14	1.89	
However,
we employ TEM for further investigation because the structure
of SiCN cannot be completely demonstrate by XRD. Areas (e) and (f)
(Figure 3d) are chosen
for high-resolution TEM analysis, which is shown in Figure 3e,f, respectively. The crystal
lattices of SiC, Si3N4, and graphite show that
SiCN material is mainly a mixture of these three crystals. Because
of the low crystallinity of the SiC, Si3N4,
and graphite crystals that may be covered by large amounts
of amorphous phases, SiC and Si3N4 phases are
not found in the XRD pattern (Figure 1b).

2.2 Electrochemical Performances
The
electrochemical performances of SiCN–graphene composite as
anodes in Li-ion batteries are shown in Figures 4–5. Figure 4a shows the cycle performances of 1–5#SiCN
anodes at the current density of 40 mA g–1 and cutoff
voltage of 0.01–1.0 V. After 100 charge and discharge cycles,
the specific delithiation capacities of the SiCN anodes in the order
of increasing label number remained at 193.2, 290.6, 398.2, 665.5,
and 826.7 mA h g–1. Except for the first two cycles,
the Coulombic efficiency of all of the SiCN anodes was above 97% (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). Although
the Coulombic efficiency of the first cycle was not satisfied, the
numerical value of Coulombic efficiency increased from 28.2 to 75.5%
from 1 to 5#SiCN, indicating outstanding performance of the 5#SiCN
anode. The low Coulombic efficiency in the first few charge–discharge
cycles, which can often be found in many Si-based anodes in the lithium-ion
battery, was caused by the large volume expansion during the lithiation–delithiation
process, which caused serious pulverization and delamination.37,38 After the first two cycles, the capacity of all of the 1–5#SiCN
anodes is kept stable, showing no phenomenon of capacity decay; this
is because the active materials of SiCN anodes become stable and electrochemically
reversible after the first two cycles.

Figure 4b shows the charge and discharge potential
curves vs capacity for the 5#SiCN anode at the 1st, 2nd, 10th, 25th,
50th, and 100th charge/discharge cycles. The slow slopes of charge–discharge
potential curves without any distinct potential plateaus indicate
an amorphous structure of the oxidation–reduction sites available
for the insertion and extraction of Li ions, which is consistent with
their XRD patterns in Figure 1b.

As known, to obtain the available voltage gap between
the cathode
and anode in lithium-ion full-cells, the anode must work at low voltages.
Therefore, our SiCN anodes are tested under different cutoff voltages
in half-cells to predict the capability in full-cells. Figure 4c shows the cycle performance
of 5#SiCN anode under the same charge and discharge conditions with
different cutoff voltages. As shown, the specific reversible capacities
of the 5#SiCN anode are approximately 826.7, 941.1, 1037.1, 612.5,
and 658.7 mA h g–1 corresponding to the cutoff voltage
ranges of 0.01–1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 V, respectively.
At lower cutoff voltages (1.0 and 1.5 V), the 5#SiCN has a better
cycle stability. However, at higher cutoff voltages (2.0, 2.5, and
3 V), it has the worst cycle stability because the number of the lithium-ion
insertion/deinsertion at the higher cutoff voltage is much more than
that at the lower cutoff voltage. Thus, more structural damage may
occur in the anode at the higher cutoff voltage, resulting in capacity
fading. Figure 4c reveals
that even at the low cutoff voltage of 0.01–1.0 V, the 5#SiCN
anode can still deliver a high reversible capacity of over 820 mA
h g–1, which is qualified as an anode material in
Li-ion full-cells.

Figure 4d shows
the high-rate performance of 1–5#SiCN anodes at different current
densities between the cutoff voltage of 0.01 and 1.0 V. Among them,
5#SiCN anode exhibits the best performance, delivering the highest
capacity of about 863.8, 833.0, 776.5, 724.2, 677.8, 637.2, 588.4,
and 569.6 mA h g–1 at each of the applied current
densities of 40, 80, 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 mA g–1, respectively. This excellent high-rate performance
of SiCN anodes is very attractive in LIBs.

We employ full-cells
to investigate the voltage window of our SiCN
anode. The SiCN electrode is used as an anode and the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM cathode, type
622, SamSung Company) is used as the cathode. The lithium-ion electrolyte
and cell separator were the same as that of the half-cells. The cyclic
voltammetry (CV) profiles of NCM/5#SiCN in a full-cell at the scan
rate of 0.05 mV s–1 for the first five scanned cycles
are shown in Figure 5a. There are wide reduction peaks at around 3.0 and 4.0 V and an
oxidation peak at 3.2 V, suggesting that our NCM/5#SiCN full-cell
could work well. Moreover, the five cycle curves could almost coincide,
indicating that the NCM/5#SiCN full-cell could exhibit stable capacity
during lithiation/delithiation cycles. As shown in Figure 5b, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) test is carried out to evaluate the electrochemical
kinetics properties of our best-performance 5#SiCN anode in a half-cell
at the 1st, 10th, 50th, and 100th charge/discharge cycle. Each Nyquist
plot of cycle 1–100 consists of a high-to-medium frequency-depressed
semicircle and a low-frequency straight line, corresponding to the
charge-transfer resistance representing the electrode reaction kinetics,
and a Warburg resistance associated with the diffusion process of
lithium ions in the electrode.35,36 After the extended
cycling from 1 to 10 cycles, the charge-transfer resistance of the
5#SiCN decreased tremendously. The decrease is ascribed to the loss
of active materials upon cycling, which leads to the capacity decay.
With continued cycling from 10 to 100 cycles, the charge-transfer
resistance remains unchanged, evidencing the stability of the electrode
after first 10 cycles. That phenomenon matches well with the charge/discharge
cycling performance shown in Figure 4a.

full-cell (NCM cathode). (b) EIS Nyquist plots of experimental data
of 5#SiCN anodes in a half-cell.

2.3 Theoretical Capacity
For further
understanding of the SiCN composites, we calculate the theoretical
capacity and speculate the corresponding lithiation/delithiation reaction.
Our SiCN composite is mainly the mixture of SiC, Si3N4, and graphite crystals, which is proved by TEM (Figure 3e,f). Accordingly,
the lithiation/delithiation capacity of our SiCN composite is mainly
attributed to the SiC, Si3N4, and graphite.
When they react with Li completely, SiC reacts with Li to form Li4.4Si and LiC6, and Si3N4 reacts
with Li to form Li4.4Si and Li3N. The lithiation/delithiation
equations are as follows    That is to say,
the numbers of electrons transferred
(n) in the two equations are 4.57 per mol SiC and
25.2 per mol Si3N4, respectively. According
to the formula of theoretical capacity  where F is the Faraday constant, n is the number
of electrons transferred in the lithiation/delithiation
reaction, and M is the molecular weight of active
material. Therefore    As known, the theoretical
capacity of graphite
is 372 mA h g–1. The total theoretical capacity
of the composite is equal to the sum of the theoretical capacity of
above three components multiplied by their respective weight ratio
in the SiCN composite.

Herein, we can estimate the theoretical
capacity of the SiCN composite by a simple mathematic calculation.
Take 5#SiCN as an example. To explore the weight percentage of Si-based
compound (mainly SiC and Si3N4) and graphite,
we employ SEM and EDX analyses to compare the chemical components
in the anodes before and after charge/discharge cycles. Figure 6 shows the SEM images of 5#SiCN anode before and after 100
charge/discharge cycles. Tables 3 and 4 are the corresponding
element weight percentages of 5#SiCN anode before and after 100 charge/discharge
cycles. From Tables 3 and 4, the weight percentages of Si-base
compound in the 5#SiCN composite electrode is approximately 22 wt
% before cycling and 14 wt % after cycling. We suppose that the average
capacity of Si-based compounds (SiC and Si3N4) in the composite is (3055 + 4816)/2 = 3935.5 mA h g–1. Hence, the initial capacity (before cycling) of the SiCN composite = (3935.5 ×
22%) + (372 × 78%) = 1156 mA h g–1; the reversible
capacity (after cycling) of the SiCN composite = (3935.5 × 14%)
+ (372 × 86%) = 871 mA h g–1.

anode before (a, b) and after 100 charge/discharge
cycles (c, d). Inserted numbers in (b) and (d) are EDX analysis areas.

5	11.93	35.11	22.29	26.76	3.60	 	
This calculated capacity of the SiCN composite properly matches
its actual reversible capacity. As shown in Figure 4a, the actual reversible capacity of our
5#SiCN electrodes is ∼830 mA h g–1 after
100 charge/discharge cycles. However, because the weight ratio of
Si-based compounds and graphite is different in the final composites,
the reversible capacities of 1–5#SiCN samples vary from ∼200
to 830 mA h g–1.

2.4 Capacity-Fading
Analysis
To further
explore why 5#SiCN has the best extraordinary electrochemical performance
among the five SiCN anodes, we compare its chemical components before
and after charge/discharge cycles. Before cycling (Figure 6a), the SiCN particles are
embedded into the carbon black powder to form a flat and homogeneous
electrode surface. After cycling (Figure 6c), the electrode surface has no big changes.
The SiCN particles maintain good contact with the conductive material,
the carbon black powder, to ensure electronic conductivity of the
active material in the electrode, in turn, decreasing the capacity
decay of the 5#SiCN anode. In Figure 6b,d, the inserted rectangular frames with numbers are
the areas analyzed by EDX. Tables 3 and 4 are the element weight
percentages of 5#SiCN anode before and after 100 charge/discharge
cycles, respectively. Before cycling, the areas 1–3 in Figure 6b are mainly composed
of silicon, carbon, oxygen, and slight amounts of fluorine and chlorine.
The areas 4–7 in Figure 6b are mainly composed of carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and slight
amount of silicon, indicating that the areas 1–3 are SiCN particles
and the areas 4–7 mainly are carbon black. After 100 charge/discharge
cycles, the areas 1 and 2 in Figure 6d represent the active material (SiCN particles), whereas
areas 3 and 4 represent the conductive material (carbon black). Chlorine
is the complete reacted reagents in the synthetic process. Oxygen,
fluorine, and phosphorus (Table 4) come from the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs)
layer that was formed during the charge/discharge cycle. The element
weight percentages in area 8 of Figure 6b and area 5 in Figure 6d represent the total element distribution based on
the large surface area of the electrode. In comparison, the contents
of silicon and carbon of SiCN particle in the electrode are decreased,
whereas the contents of oxygen, fluorine, and phosphorus in the electrode
are increased. The same tendency is also exhibited in the area of
carbon black, indicating the formation of stable and compact SEI layer
on the surface anode protects the electrode cracking during the charge/discharge
cycle, resulting in decrease in the capacity decay.

To investigate
the possible capacity decay mechanism of the SiCN anodes, XRD characterization
of the anode materials is performed after electrochemical testing. Figure 7 shows the XRD patterns
of the 1–5#SiCN anodes after 100 charge/discharge cycles. There
are many Li–C, Li–Si, Li–N, and Si–N phases
in the 1–5#SiCN anodes after cycling, indicating that the original
phases of Si3N4, SiC, and graphite (observed
by TEM in Figure 3e,f)
in the SiCN anodes are transferred into the above-mentioned Li–C,
Li–Si, and Li–N phase in the Li-ion insertion/extraction
process. According to same references, Si3N4 phase is less reactive and irreversible in the lithiation/delithiation
than the SiC phase.7,35,36 Therefore, the less Si3N4 phase in the electrode
will decrease the capacity decay to some extent. In Figure 7, the 5#SiCN anode has less
Si3N4 phase among the five SiCN materials, which
was also confirmed by the element analysis in Table 2 (the nitrogen ration is only 1.14 wt %).
Thus, the less Si3N4 phase may the main reason
for the best cycle stability of 5#SiCN among the five SiCN anodes.

In addition, the excellent electrochemical performance of
5#SiCN
anodes is attributed to the composition of its polymer in the preparation.
The carbon content in the 5#SiCN polymer is highest among all five
SiCN polymers (Table 2). After pyrolysis, the carbon content is also the highest in the
final product. As known, the carbon is very important for the cycle
stability of the anode materials. Hence, adoption of a carbon-rich
polymer for preparation is another key role to improve the cycle stability
and decrease the capacity decay of SiCN anode.

3 Conclusions
The polymer-derived SiCN materials have been
synthesized by the
pyrolysis of five different polymers, poly(silylcarbondiimide). The
SiCN materials are utilized as anodes for Li-ion batteries. Among
the five SiCN samples, the 5#SiCN exhibits the best cycle stability,
a high-rate performance, and Coulombic efficiency even at the low
cutoff voltage of 0.01–1.0 V, which is qualified for use as
the anode material in Li-ion full-cells. After 100 charge and discharge
cycles, the specific delithiation capacity of 5#SiCN anode remains
at 826.7 mA h g–1. The 5#SiCN anode delivers above
550 mA h g–1 even at the high current densities
of 1.6 and 2 A g–1. Except for the first two cycles,
the Coulombic efficiency of all of the SiCN anodes is above 97%. The
outstanding electrochemical performance of 5#SiCN anode is attributed
to the formation of a stable and compact SEI layer on the anode surface
anode, which protects the electrode from cracking during the charge/discharge
cycle, resulting in decrease in capacity decay. Moreover, large amount
of carbon component and less Si3N4 phase in
the 5#SiCN material provide a much more electrochemically reactive
and conductive environment in the SiCN structure, which benefits the
lithiation/delithiation process. The results indicate that the following
research should focus on the SiCN polymer composition, which has the
important effect of further optimizing the carbon-rich SiCN structure
on the corresponding pyrolyzed products for excellent electrochemical
performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Polymer-Derived SiCN
The polymer-derived
SiCN material was prepared by pyrolyzing a poly(siylcarbondiimide)
precursor, which was synthesized by the aminolysis reaction of 1,2-ethylenediamine
(EDA), triethylamine (TEA), and dichloromethylsilane (DCMS). The synthesis
details are as follows: first, a solution of EDA (0.08 mol, 4.76 g)
and TEA (0.16 mol, 14.90 g) in 100 mL toluene was placed in a 500
mL three-neck round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a
dropping funnel, and an argon inlet. The mixed solution was magnetically
stirred. Then, dichloromethylvinylsilane (DCMVS, 0.04 mol, 5.20 g)
and dichloromethylsilane (DCMS, 0.04 mol, 4.10 mL) in 50 mL toluene
were then added slowly from the dropping funnel to this solution,
and the reaction temperature was kept below 40 °C. The reaction
mixture was refluxed at 60 °C for 40 min and then heated up to
100 °C and kept refluxed for 90 min. All of the reaction was
carried out under an argon atmosphere. After the reaction mixture
was cooled to room temperature, the precipitate (trimethylamine hydrochloride
salt) was filtered off and the filtrate was rotary evaporated to remove
the solvent and other volatile components. The remaining yellow oil
was dried at room temperature under argon atmosphere overnight to
obtain the precursor poly(silylcarbondiimide). The polymer precursor
was cross-linked into a colloidal solid at 80 °C using 2,2-azo-bis-iso-butyronitrile
(AIBN) as a radical initiator. After that, the cross-linked precursor
was placed in an Al2O3 crucible and pyrolyzed
in an alumina tube furnace under argon flow at 1000 °C for 1
h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 to obtain
SiCN bulk materials. Finally, the SiCN bulks were grinded and sieved
with a 200 meshed standard sieve to obtain 1#SiCN powders.

With
the same preparation process, dichlorodiethylsilane (DCDES), dichloromethyloctylsilane
(DCMOS), dichlorodiphenylsilane (DCDPS), and di-n-octyldichlorosilane (DODCS) are replaced by dichloromethylsilane
(DCMS) to obtain 2–5#SiCN powders, respectively. The dosages
of the chemicals for the synthesis and the as-prepared SiCN products
numbers are listed in Table 5. The preparation process of SiCN synthesis is shown in Figure 8. EDA, TEA, toluene,
and AIBN were purchased from Jiangtian Tongyi Corp., China. DCMVS,
DCMS, DCDES, DCMOS, DCDPS, and DODCS were purchased from Alfa-Asear
Corp., China. EDA, TEA, and toluene were removed of water by distillation
before use. AIBN, DCMVS, DCMS, DCDES, DCMOS, DCDPS, and DODCS was
used without purification.

4.2 Material Characterization
The morphologies
of as-prepared SiCN materials were characterized with a scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JSM-7500F, the National Center for Electron Microscopy
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, Philiphs, Tianjin Normal
University). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken on a
Bruker D8A X-ray diffraction (Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were
obtained on a Nicolet IR200 automatic infrared spectrometer (Thermo).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under argon using TGA
Q600 system (TA Instruments). The sample was heated from room temperature
to 1000 °C min–1. Carbon and nitrogen elemental
analyses were carried out with a Vario El Cube (Elementar Analysensytem
Gmbh, Germany). Raman measurements were performed on an Invia Raman
microscope (Renishaw, England) with excitation laser beam wavelength
of 514 nm.

4.3 Electrode Fabrication
The SiCN anodes
were fabricated by mixing the SiCN powders with acetylene black (AB)
and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) binder in the weight ratio of 5:4:1.
Dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), the mixtures
were stirred at room temperature into a uniform slurry. Then, they
were coated on an copper foil current collector with a Mitutoyo doctor
blade and an Elcometer motorized film applicator. Mass loading of
SiCN (the active material) was ∼1.5 mg cm–2. There was no modification of the current collector and the separator.
After the NMP had dried off, the electrode laminated was further dried
in vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h. From the SEM image of the cross-sectional
view of the electrode in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information, the total thickness of the electrode could
be observed as ∼25 μm. Acetylene black (AB) was purchased
from Denka, Japan. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, anhydrous,
99.5 wt %) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.4 Half-Cell
Assembly
The 2325 coin
cells (parts from National Research Council of Canada) were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox with an oxygen concentration of 0.1 ppm
and a dew point of −70 °C. The SiCN electrode was punched
to 9/16″ outer diameter (OD) and the counter electrode was
a lithium metal disk of 11/16″ OD. The lithium-ion electrolyte
was purchased from BASF, including 1.2 mol L–1 LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC = 3/7
w/w) containing 30 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate. The cell separator
was polypropylene film (Celgard 2400) obtained from Celgard. Lithium
foil was purchased from FMC-Lithium Corporation.

4.5 Full-Cell Assembly
The 2325 coin
cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with an oxygen concentration
of 0.1 ppm and a dew point of −70 °C. The 5#SiCN material
was used as a anode and the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM cathode, type 622, SamSung) used as a
cathode in the full-cell. The NCM cathode was fabricated by mixing
the NCM powders with acetylene black (AB) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) binder in the weight ratio of 8:1:1. Dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), the mixtures were stirred at room temperature
into a uniform slurry. Then they were coated on an copper foil current
collector with a Mitutoyo doctor blade and an Elcometer motorized
film applicator. Mass loading of NCM (the active material) was ∼3.0
mg cm–2. There was no modification of the current
collector and the separator. After the NMP had dried off, the electrode
laminated was further dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h. The
SiCN anode was fabricated to be used in half-cell electrode, punched
to 11/16″ OD. The NCM cathode was punched to 9/16″ OD.
The lithium-ion electrolyte and cell separator were the same as the
half-cells.

4.6 Cell Testing
Galvanostatic
cycling
tests were performed on a Maccor Series 4000 Battery Test System in
a thermal chamber at 30 °C. As for the half-cell, the voltage
window for cell test is 0.01–1.0 V; however, for the full-cell,
the voltage window for cell test is 1.0–4.3 V. The calculation
methods of current density and specific capacity are provided in the Supporting Information. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
test was performed on a Parstat 3000 galvanostat/potentiostat workstation
(Princeton Applied Research, AMETEK) at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s–1 at a potential interval 1.0 and 4.3 V. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also conducted on a Parstat 3000
workstation with a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. The amplitude
used for impedance measurement is 5 mV.
