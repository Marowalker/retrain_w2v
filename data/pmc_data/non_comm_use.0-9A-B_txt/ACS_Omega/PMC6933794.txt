Arsenite (As(III)) contamination in drinking water has
become a
worldwide problem in recent years, which leads to development of various
As(III) remediation approaches. In this study, two biomass-based nanostructured
materials, microscale dialdehyde cellulose–cysteine (MDAC–cys)
and nanoscale dialdehyde cellulose–cysteine (NDAC–cys)
fibers, have been prepared from wood pulp. Their As(III) removal efficiencies
and mechanism were determined by combined adsorption, atomic fluorescence
spectrometry, microscopy (scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy), and spectroscopy
(Fourier transform infrared, 13C CPMAS NMR) methods. The
adsorption results of these materials could be well described by the
Freundlich isotherm model, where the maximum adsorption capacities
estimated by the Langmuir isotherm model were 344.82 mg/g for MDAC–cys
and 357.14 mg/g for NDAC–cys, respectively. Both MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys materials were further characterized by X-ray
diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, where the results indicated
that the thiol groups (the S content in MDAC–cys was 12.70
and NDAC–cys was 17.15%) on cysteine were primarily responsible
for the adsorption process. The nanostructured MDAC–cys system
appeared to be more suitable for practical applications because of
its high cost-effectiveness.

Introduction
Arsenic is a toxic and carcinogenic element
that exists in several
forms in atmosphere, soils, and water.1−4 As drinking water is the most direct pathway
for people to intake arsenic, high arsenic concentration in water
supplies in some regions has become a major public health issue.5−7 The chronic arsenic ingestion can cause skin cancer, bladder cancer,
and kidney cancer, whereas acute arsenic exposure can lead to black
foot disease, immunological system disorders, spontaneous pregnancy
loss, and respiratory complications.8,9 Because of
both chronic and acute health threats on the human body, the limited
arsenic concentration of 10 ppb in drinking water has been stipulated
by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2011.10

In nature, arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III))
are two most
common forms of arsenic11 in contaminated
water. Compared with As(V), As(III) is more resistant and has higher
health risks upon exposure. As a result, As(III) removal from water
has been of more urgent need.12−15 Currently, numerous methods for As(III) removal from
drinking water have been reported. These methods include the approaches
of precipitation/coagulation,16 membrane
separation,17−19 ion exchange,20 and adsorption.21 Among these methods, adsorption is an appealing
approach because of its low cost, high efficiency, relatively low
energy consumption, and versatility for different water treatments.9,22,23 In the current literature, iron
oxides, activated alumina, and activated carbon are the most commonly
used adsorbents for arsenic removal.11,24−26 However, these adsorbents also possess different challenges such
as complicated preparation procedures,24,27 inconvenience
in usage,26 high preparation cost,27 and low biocompatibility that could lead to
serious secondary contamination in treated water.28 As a result, there is still a need to develop more environmentally
friendly, sustainable, and low cost adsorbent materials that can avoid
some of the abovementioned problems but still be effective to treat
As(III)-contaminated water, which forms the base for this study.

Cellulose is the most abundant and renewable natural polymer in
the world and is an ideal source to extract water purification materials
in a large scale at low cost.28,29 Some examples of using
cellulose-based materials to remove toxic metal ions from water are
as follows. Succinic anhydride-modified nanocellulose has been shown
to be effective to remove heavy metal ions (e.g., Cr(VI) and Pd(II))
and dyes30,31 from water. Carbon aerogel prepared from
microcrystalline cellulose has also been proven as an effective medium
for removal of Cr(V) and Pb(II) ions.32 The oxidized form of nanocellulose, such as carboxylated cellulose
nanofiber (CNF), was found to possess excellent adsorption capability
against uranium ions (UO22+),33,34 Pb(II) ions,35 and Cd(II) ions.36 Ferric hydroxide-coated CNFs have also been
shown as a good adsorbent to remove phosphate from wastewater.37 In addition, three-dimensional porous cellulose
was found to be an effective adsorbent with high capacity to remove
cationic dyes.38 Recently, we further demonstrated
that nanocomposites based on zinc oxide nanocrystal decorated regenerated
microfibrillated cellulose have very high maximum capacity for As(V)
removal.39

For As(III) removal, our
previous work using thiol-functionalized
chitin nanofibers only showed a medium removal efficiency (the maximum
adsorption capacity was 149 mg/g at pH = 7.0).40 In this study, we have designed a new adsorbent system
containing higher concentration of thiol groups, based on the cellulose
scaffold extracted from wood pulp, to improve the As(III) removal
efficiency. These adsorbents can be prepared from any biomass in nature,
thus representing a sustainable and potential low cost pathway for
arsenic remediation.

To prepare the new absorbent system, two
routes were carried out,
leading to generation of nanostructured fibrous scaffolds at different
scales (micro and nano). The schematic diagram of these two routes
is shown in Figure 1. For the preparation of microscale scaffold, C2–C3 bonds in cellulose were selectively oxidized by sodium periodate
to yield microscale dialdehyde cellulose (MDAC), where two aldehyde
groups were formed at C2 and C3 positions of
the anhydroglucose unit on the cellulose surface.41,42 This oxidation process could cause significant changes in the properties
of microscale cellulose, such as the decrease in crystallinity.43,44 The Schiff-base MDAC and the cysteine complex (MDAC–cys)
was further prepared by reacting MDAC with l-cysteine (i.e.,
through the nucleophilic reaction between aldehyde groups on MDAC
and amino groups on l-cysteine45). It has been shown that during water treatment, the thiol group
in cysteine can bind to the As(III) ion through the complexation reaction
because As(III) has high affinity for sulfur-containing ligands.31,46−48 For the nanoscale scaffold, carboxylated CNFs were
prepared first by TEMPO-mediated oxidation,49 which converted the primary hydroxyl group to carboxyl group at
the C6 position in the anhydroglucose unit, enabling the
cellulose surface to be negatively charged. The repulsive forces due
to the charged surface would facilitate the defibrillation process.
It has been shown that the TEMPO-mediated oxidation method is an effective
approach to extract CNFs from the cellulose component of biomass (i.e.,
free of lignin and hemicellulose).50−54 To prepare the nanoscale dialdehyde cellulose (NDAC)–cys
complex adsorbent, the same reaction conditions for MDAC–cys
were also used. CNFs were further oxidized by sodium periodate to
produce NDAC, which was subsequently reacted with l-cysteine
(i.e., by the nucleophilic reaction between aldehyde groups and amino
groups).45 Thus, the main difference between
MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys should be the size of the fiber
in the scaffold, where both surfaces contain thiol groups, capable
of interacting with As(III) ions.

by MDAC–cys and
NDAC–cys.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys Complexes
The synthesis routes for MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys samples
are illustrated in Figure 2, respectively. In the microscale route, the MDAC sample was
prepared directly from the wood pulp cellulose fiber. The content
of the aldehyde group in resulting MDAC was determined to be 11.23
mmol/g using the hydroxylamine hydrochloride titration method (procedures
and calculation are presented in Table S1, Supporting Information). Subsequently, l-cysteine (HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH) was attached to MDAC using the
Schiff-base reaction between aldehyde (on MDAC) and amine groups (on
cysteine) to create the MDAC–cys complex. The final sample
possessed the appearance of a microscale fiber, although each fiber
was partially fibrillated and contained a large surface to volume
ratio in water.

Figure 2 Synthesis routes of MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys.

In the nanoscale route, the starting scaffolding
material was CNFs.
The content of carboxyl groups on the surface of CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys
were first measured using the conductometric titration method.55 The degree of oxidation in the formation of
carboxyl content for CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys is illustrated
in Table 1 (the initial
conductometric titration results to determine the carboxyl content
are shown in Figure S1 and Table S2 in Supporting Information). It was found that the COOH content on the CNF
surface decreased with the subsequent periodate oxidation to produce
NDAC. This can be attributed to the degradation of nanocellulose fibers
during oxidation, which most likely occurred at the position close
to the oxidized anhydroglucose units.56−58 As a result, the resulting
NDAC possessed less carboxyl content after the periodate treatment.
This reaction also affected NDAC’s aldehyde content, which
was 7.25 mmol/g (Table S1), significantly
lower than that of MDAC. During the cysteine modification on NDAC,
the thiol and carboxyl functional groups in cysteine were introduced
without further chemical changes. Therefore, the content of the carboxyl
group in NDAC–cys was found to increase significantly because
of the presence of cysteine which also has carboxyl groups (the results
are shown in Table 1). Similar observations were also made by 13C CPMAS NMR
measurements, which will be discussed later.

and NDAC–cys

Functionalization of cysteine was investigated by
determining the
carbon (C), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) composition in MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys using the elemental analysis (Thermo Finnigan,
FLASH EA 1112) method, where the results are shown in Table 2. For MDAC–cys, the S
content was 12.70%, which indicated 0.479 g/g of cysteine was attached
on MDAC, while the S content in NDAC–cys was 17.15% and as
a result, the cysteine content in NDAC–cys was 0.648 g/g. The
cysteine content in NDAC–cys was higher than that in MDAC–cys,
indicating that NDAC–cys should be a more effective adsorbent
to remove As(III). However, it was also interesting to note that even
MDAC–cys was in the microfiber form (fiber diameter about 30
μm), and its total functionalized surface area for l-cysteine attachment was in a similar range as that of the NDAC–cys
nanofiber (fiber diameter about 5 nm). This indicated that the MDAC–cys
microfiber was partially defibrillated by the periodate oxidation
reaction and contained a great deal of inner surface region available
for functionalization.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of wood
pulp cellulose,
MDAC, MDAC–cys, and pure cysteine are illustrated in Figure 3(i). In the spectrum
of untreated wood pulp cellulose (Figure 3(i)a), two distinctive 3340 and 2900 cm–1 peaks were seen, which could be assigned to the −OH
stretching and C–H symmetrical stretching in cellulose, respectively.
In the spectrum of MDAC (Figure 3(i)b), the peaks at 1730 and 880 cm–1 could be attributed to the carbonyl groups and hemi-acetal units
in cellulose, respectively. These peaks confirmed the formation of
dialdehyde cellulose.59,60 After the cysteine attachment,
the 1730 cm–1 peak became more distinct (Figure 3(i)c), which could
be attributed to the formation of carboxyl groups, verifying the creation
of MDAC–cys.41,61 Notably, MDAC and MDAC–cys
still possessed the 3340 cm–1 peak because of the
−OH stretching. However, the intensity of this peak decreased
as a result of the decreases in hydroxyl groups at the C2 and C3 position for both MDAC and MDAC–cys. Similarly,
the peak at 2900 cm–1, corresponding to the C–H
stretching, were present in both MDAC and MDAC–cys, but their
intensities became much lower than that of wood pulp cellulose. This
is because during the conversion of cellulose to MDAC–cys,
the hydroxyl groups at C2 and C3 positions were
first converted into aldehyde groups and then to imine groups. Finally,
the peak at 1640 cm–1 was seen in MDAC–cys,
which could be assigned to the C=N stretching.62

(b) NDAC, and (c) NDAC–cys; (iv) 13C CPMAS NMR spectra

The solid state 13C CPMAS NMR spectra
of wood pulp cellulose,
MDAC, and MDAC–cys are shown in Figure 3(ii). In the spectrum of wood pulp (Figure 3(ii)a), the signal
at 66 ppm could be assigned to the carbon at the C6 position.
The doublets between 70 and 80 ppm could be assigned to the C2, C3, and C5 carbons. The peak at 89
ppm was because of the C4 carbon, and the peak between
100 and 110 ppm was associated with the anomeric carbon at C1.63,64 After the periodate oxidation, the peak
around 201 ppm was observed, corresponding to the aldehyde group in
MDAC at C2 and C3 positions. Typically, the
peak related to the aldehyde group in cellulose is difficult to detect
by NMR because of the conversion of the dialdehyde group to the acetal
form. The sharper peaks in the NMR spectrum of wood pulp cellulose
were because of the high degree of crystallinity, which was also supported
by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) data to be discussed later.
The periodate oxidation treatment was found to be able to profoundly
decrease the crystallinity of cellulose, resulting in low crystallinity
MDAC with a broad NMR spectrum,41 which
was also confirmed by WAXD. In the spectra of Figure 3(ii)b (MDAC), the C2, C3, and C5 regions were found to merge together, which was
also the case of MDAC–cys (Figure 3(ii)c). However, in the MDAC–cys spectrum,
a distinct peak at 173 ppm was seen, which could be attributed to
the carboxyl group in cysteine. New peaks at 31 and 58 ppm could be
attributed to the backbone carbon and side chain carbon in cysteine,
respectively. It is clear that the 13C CPMAS NMR results
confirmed the synthesis of the MDAC–cys complex and the further
decrease in cellulose crystallinity during the Schiff-base reaction.
The summary of the characteristic 13C CPMAS NMR peaks in
wood pulp cellulose, MDAC, and MDAC–cys is presented in Table
S3 in Supporting Information.

The
FTIR spectra of CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys are shown in Figure 3(iii). In the spectrum
of CNFs, the peak appeared at 1600 cm–1 could be
attributed to the −COONa stretch induced by the TEMPO oxidation
process. After periodate oxidation, the distinctive peak at 1730 cm–1 showed up which indicated the presence of carbonyl
groups in NDAC. In the spectrum of NDAC–cys, the peak at 1730
cm–1 became more intense after the cysteine attachment,
whereas the peak at 1640 cm–1 (C=N stretch)
was also observed, indicating the formation of NDAC–cys.

The 13C CPMAS NMR spectra for CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys
were also collected and the results are shown in Figure 3(iv). This figure also included
the cellulose spectrum with the peaks in the range from 60 to 110
ppm marked as references. In Figure 3(iv)b, the appearance of the 175 ppm peak clearly indicated
the presence of the carboxyl group in TEMPO-oxidized CNFs. It was
found that TEMPO-mediated oxidation did not severely decrease the
crystallinity of cellulose because the general feature of the peaks
in the spectrum remained sharp. When CNFs were converted to NDAC by
periodate oxidation, the 175 ppm peak was found to decrease notably
(Figure 3(iv)c), indicating
that the carboxyl content in NDAC became lower than that in CNFs.
This was consistent with the titration results shown in Table 1. It was found that the overall
crystallinity in NDAC remained higher even though the periodate oxidation
process had a great tendency to degrade the cellulose chains. In NDAC–cys
(Figure 3(iv)d), the
intensity of the peak at 175 ppm because of the carboxyl group, as
well as those of the peaks at 31 and 58 ppm, increased sharply. This
was because of the presence of cysteine molecules, not from the cellulose
entity. The overall crystallinity of NDAC–cys was still high after the Schiff-base reaction
(Table 3).

Structure and Morphology of MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys
and Their As(III)-Adsorbed Composites
The surface morphology
of MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys complexes before and after
the As(III) adsorption was carried out by scanning electron microscopy/energy
dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) measurements, and the results are
shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. All these images were collected
using freeze-dried samples. In Figure 4, it was seen that wood pulp cellulose showed long
and thick microscale fibers with an average diameter of 34 μm.
However, after the periodate oxidation, MDAC fibers became thinner
(with an average diameter of 30 μm), shorter, and more porous.
From the solid sample, it was difficult to determine the true porosity
of the microfiber. After the cysteine attachment, the overall morphology
and the average diameter of MDAC–cys fibers remained the same
as those of MDAC. This indicated that the majority of cysteine attachment
took place inside the microfiber, which confirmed that the microfiber
was partially defibrillated containing a high inner surface area.
The morphology of the floc sample (MDAC–cys–As(III)-1500)
prepared by adsorption of As(III) at 1500 ppm with MDAC–cys
is shown in Figure 4d. It was seen that some portion of MDAC–cys became severely
aggregated and covered by the As(III) layer. The corresponding EDS
spectra of MDAC–cys and MDAC–cys–As(III)-1500
are shown in Figure 4e,f, respectively. The EDS spectrum of MDAC–cys–As(III)-1500
(Figure 4f) clearly
illustrated the presence of high As content in the floc sample. The
SEM image and element mapping spectra of the MDAC–cys–As(III)-500
sample prepared by adsorption of 500 ppm As(III) are shown in Figure
S2 (Supporting Information) in which the
overall morphology was found to be similar to that shown in Figure 4d, even though the
As(III) content was 3 times less.

Figure 5 illustrates
typical SEM images and corresponding EDS spectra of NDAC–cys
NDAC–cys–As(III)-1500 samples. In NDAC–cys (Figure 5a), the SEM image
showed strong fiber aggregation, where only bundles of aggregated
nanofibers could be identified (the average bundle diameter was 70
nm). In Figure 5b,
the SEM image indicated that the floc surface containing the matrix
of NDAC–cys became relatively smooth (because of strong fiber
aggregation), where the adsorbed As(III) formed nanoparticles dispersed
quite uniformly on the floc surface. The EDS spectrum of NDAC–cys
showed the appearance of C, O, and S peaks (S was due to the presence
of cysteine), whereas the EDS spectrum of NDAC–cys–As(III)-1500
floc showed a distinct As peak (the NDAC–cys–As(III)-500
floc prepared with 500 ppm of As(III) exhibited similar morphology
and EDS results as shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information).

WAXD profiles of wood pulp cellulose, MDAC,
MDAC–cys, and
the reference compound (l-cysteine) are illustrated in Figure 6(i). It was seen
that the WAXD profile of cellulose exhibited a relatively high crystallinity
index (63.18%), based on the Segal empirical equation,65 using the (002) crystalline peak at 22.5°
and the amorphous background at 18° as the references. The equation
is shown below (eq 1) 1  

Figure 6 WAXD spectra of (i) (a) wood pulp cellulose,
(b) MDAC, (c) MDAC–cys,
and (d) cysteine; (ii) (a) wood pulp cellulose, (b) CNF, (c) NDAC,
(d) NDAC–cys, and (e) cysteine; (iii) MDAC–cys–As(III)
in 1500 ppm and (iv) NDAC–cys–As(III) in 1500 ppm.

It was also found that after periodate oxidation,
the crystallinity
of MDAC disappeared almost completely (Figure 6(i)b). This observation was consistent with
the 13C CPMAS NMR results (Figure 3(ii)), where the relevant peaks to C1, C4, C2,3,5, and C6 has
drastically broadened. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area result showed that MDAC has a surface area of 1.87 m2/g (Figure S4). This value was
comparable to that of NDAC (to be discussed later), confirming the
nanostructured nature of the MDAC microfiber that are partially defibrillated.
The WAXD profile of the MDAC–cys sample exhibited distinct
diffraction peaks (Figure 6(i)c), which did not bear resemblance to pure l-cysteine
crystals (Figure 6(i)d).
We speculate that the molecular complexes between cysteine and the
aldehyde group might form some form of crystal structure at a very
small scale. The WAXD profile of MDAC–cys thus contained an
amorphous cellulose background (MDAC) and diffraction from the crystal
of cysteine-based molecular complexes. After As(III) adsorption, the
MDAC–cys–As(III)-1500 floc samples exhibited the diffraction
profile that could be indexed perfectly by the crystal of arsenolite
(As2O3) as shown in Figure 6(iii).66 This
indicated that the presence of cysteine provided an effective adsorption
site for the mineralization of As2O3 crystals.
Based on the SEM image (Figure 4f), a thin layer of As2O3 crystals appeared
on the surface of the MDAC–cys scaffold.

Figure 6(ii) illustrates
the WAXD profiles of cellulose, NDAC, NDAC–cys, and l-cysteine. It was seen that the crystallinity index of CNFs was increased
by the TEMPO oxidation method (CI(CNF) = 75%, Figure 6(ii)b), but the crystallinity
index of NDAC was severely decreased by the periodate oxidation treatment
as shown by the drastic decrease in the intensity of the (002) peak
as shown in Figure 6(ii)c. The surface area of NDAC was determined to be 3.97 m2/g from the BET surface measurement (Figure S4). However, the crystallinity index of NDAC was still larger than
that of MDAC that was almost completely amorphous. The WAXD profile
of NDAC–cys was very similar to that of MDAC–cys, but
the former showed more distinct diffraction peaks, indicating the
higher crystallinity in the cellulose scaffold and probably the larger
size of the cysteine-based molecular complex crystal. The WAXD profile
of NDAC–cys–As(III)-1500 shown in Figure 6(iv) could be indexed well by the claudetite
II crystal, which is a polymorph of the As2O3 crystal.67 However, severe peak broadening
was seen in the diffraction profile of NDAC–cys–As(III)-1500,
as compared with the profile of MDAC–cys–As(III)-1500.
This indicated that the resulting crystal size (claudetite II) in
NDAC–cys–As(III)-1500 was much smaller, which was consistent
with the observation of As2O3 nanocrystal formation
in Figure 5b.

The morphology of CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys were also investigated
by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique. CNFs extracted
by the TEMPO oxidation method exhibited an average width of 5 nm and
an average length of 200 nm as illustrated in Figure 7a. After the periodate oxidation, the average
length of NDAC decreased slightly (to 150 nm) but the average width
remained the same. The decrease in the length of NDAC clearly indicated
that the periodate oxidation process caused degradation in CNFs. The
morphology of NDAC–cys suggested that the modification of cysteine
seemed to cause some aggregation of nanofibers. This is not truly
surprising as cysteine is a zwitterionic molecule, where the positively
charged amine group can interact with the negatively charged carboxylate
group on the CNFs and cause the CNFs to aggregate because of the screening
effect.

The thicknesses of CNFs, NDAC, and NDAC–cys
nanofibers were
investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the results are
shown in Figure 8.
The AFM image of CNFs confirmed that the thickness of the extracted
CNFs was 4–5 nm, in agreement with TEM results as well as previous
literature.68 This suggested that the cross-section
of the TEMPO-oxidized CNF was a square shape. The periodate oxidation
treatment clearly decreased the average fiber thickness to about 3.5
nm. The Schiff-base reaction further decreased the average fiber thickness
to about 2.6 nm, even though the average width appeared to be the
same.

Thermal Property
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
has been routinely used to investigate the thermal stability of the
cellulose-based samples.69Figure 9(i) illustrates the TGA curves
of cellulose, MDAC, MDAC–cys, NDAC, and NDAC–cys samples.
The onset temperature, highest degradation temperature, and final
residue percentage of these samples are listed in Table S4 (Supporting Information). One common feature in
dehydration was observed in these samples. In this process, 0.55–1.22%
of weight loss was observed in the temperature range between 25 and
100 °C. In wood pulp cellulose, the second weight loss started
at 243 °C, which has often been considered as the primary cellulose
structure degradation, and left behind 8.3% residue at 850 °C.
These results are consistent with the literature data.70 It is well known that the extensive hydrogen
bonding between cellulose chains in the crystal structure can greatly
increase the thermal stability, whereas the loss of crystallinity
can also decrease the thermal stability.71 This was certainly the case for MDAC, where degradation started
at 170 °C. Furthermore, degradation of MDAC–cys commenced
even at a lower temperature (115 °C), which was consistent with
the loss of crystallinity as observed by NMR and WAXD techniques.
It has been reported that l-cysteine starts to decompose
at 250 °C,72 which overlapped with
the main degradation region of MDAC–cys. As a result, the degradation
process of cysteine could not be observed very clearly even in derivative
thermogravimetric (DTG) curves (Figure 9(ii)). It has been reported that the thermal degradation
of TEMPO-oxidized CNFs started to occur at approximately 200 °C,70 while for the original cellulose, degradation
began at 243 °C. This is because the formation of sodium carboxylate
groups led to a significant reduction in thermal stability.73−75 NDAC appeared to decompose at around 154 °C, significantly
lower than that of CNFs. Compared to NDAC, NDAC–cys thermal
degradation started even at a lower temperature (around 101 °C),
indicating that the thermal stability of NDAC–cys was the lowest
among the tested samples.

The DTG curves of cellulose, MDAC, MDAC–cys,
NDAC, and NDAC–cys
are shown in Figure 9(ii), and the corresponding maximum degradation temperature of each
sample is summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). Wood pulp cellulose exhibited a single peak with Tmax at 355 °C, which is related to the degradation
of anhydroglucose units in the cellulose chain. DTG curves of MDAC
exhibit a two-step degradation, corresponding to the degradation of
anhydroglucuroaldhehye units at 200 °C76 and the subsequent degradation of anhydroglucose units in the region
between 229 and 400 °C. The first degradation of the anhydroglucuroaldhehye
units indicated that the dialdehyde modification was randomly distributed
in the cellulose chain. The MDAC–cys also showed two-step degradation
with one small peak at 146 °C and one broad peak at 160 °C,
covering the region between 160 and 383 °C. It has been reported
that the maximum degradation for cysteine starts at 250 °C.77 Hence, the broad peak between 160 and 383 °C
could be attributed to the degradation of anhydroglucose units as
well as anhydroglucose units bonded to the cysteine moiety. It was
interesting to see that NDAC presented a three-peak degradation profile,
having the peaks at 187, 306, and 422 °C, respectively. The degradation
at 187 °C corresponded to the anhydroglucoronic units, the degradation
peaks at 306 and 422 °C could be attributed to the anhydroglucose
units in the cellulose chain in the amorphous and crystalline regions.
The DTG curve for NDAC–cys also showed three degradation steps
with peaks at 161, 249 (broad), and 324 °C, respectively. These
peaks corresponded to the degradation processes of the anhydroglucuronic
units, cysteine moiety, and anhydroglucose units, respectively.

Adsorption Efficiency against As(III)
In order to investigate
the adsorption efficiency of As(III) by MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys,
a batch remediation experiment was conducted on simulated wastewater
containing As(III) impurities. The simulated As(III)-contaminated
water was prepared according to the method described in the Experimental Section. As(III) adsorption results
using MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys as adsorbents are summarized
in Tables S5 and S6 (Supporting Information). In these tables, the Qe value (experimental
adsorption capacity) was calculated as the product of adsorption efficiency
and ideal adsorption capacity. The Ce value
was taken as the equilibrium concentration of As(III). These results
were analyzed by both the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The expression
for the Langmuir model is shown in eq 2 and the corresponding Langmuir fitting curves for
MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys are presented in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). 2  where Qm is the
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and K is a constant
for the adsorbent in a chosen temperature.

We noticed that the
Langmuir model could not fit the adsorption results for the entire
As(III) concentration range (10–2500 ppm) with a good R2 coefficient value. This is not surprising
because the Langmuir model assumes the monolayer adsorption isotherm,
which cannot account for the mineralization process of forming As2O3 crystals at the later stage. As a result, we
used the Langmuir model to fit the results in two concentration ranges,
where the first concentration range might meet the criteria of Langmuir
adsorption and the analysis could lead to the estimate of the maximum
adsorption capacity. The analysis was carried out as follows. At a
very low concentration range (10–20 ppm), a very low adsorption
efficiency was seen for both the samples (MDAC–cys: 60–70%
and NDAC–cys: 59–82%). This indicated that the ionic
bonding between As(III) and thiol group only took place partially,
whereby the adsorption data was not used in the Langmuir analysis.
At a higher concentration range (50–250 ppm), we believe that
the ionic bonding between As(III) and the thiol group probably occurred
fully, which would meet the assumption of the Langmuir model. This
is certainly the case shown in Figure S5, where the Langmuir model could fit very well for both MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys systems with good R2 coefficient values, that is, 0.943 and 0.815, respectively. The
fitting results are summarized in Table S7 (Supporting Information), where the maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) was found to be 344.82 mg/g for MDAC–cys
and 357.14 mg/g for NDAC–cys. We also used the Langmuir model
to fit the data in the concentration range of 500–2500 ppm
(Figure S5) as the reference, where the
poor R2 coefficient values clearly indicate
that the model fails when the mineralization process begins.

In contrast, we found that the Freundlich isotherm model could
be used to fit the adsorption results for the entire As(III) concentration
range (10–2500 ppm). The Freundlich isotherm model can be expressed
as follows. 3  where KF and n are constants for a given adsorbate and adsorbent at the
chosen temperature. The fitting results of the As(III) adsorption
data by using the Freundlich model for MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys
are shown in Figure 10(i) and Table S8 (Supporting Information). It was found that both fits were excellent with the R2 coefficient value as high as 0.999 and 0.998 for MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys, respectively. These results are consistent with
the fact that MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys are both complex
and heterogenous systems, whereby their adsorption behavior is described
by the multilayer adsorption mechanism using the Freundlich isotherm
model.78

Figure 10 Fitting results using the Freundlich
model for the As(III) adsorption
data based on (i) MDAC–cys and (ii) NDAC–cys.

With the Freundlich model analysis, the highest Qe value obtained for MDAC–cys was 982
mg/g, when
challenged with the 2500 ppm As(III) solution. However, the Qe value obtained for MDAC–cys was only
3.58 mg/g for 10 ppm As(III) concentration. The drastic increase of
the Qe value of MDAC–cys with the
increase in the concentration of As(III) is probably because of the
occurrence of mineralization of As(III) at high concentration (>500
ppm). Similar results were obtained in previous studies involving
the adsorption of lead, cadmium, and uranium ions using nitro-oxidized
carboxycellulose.34−36 The As(III) removal efficiency of NDAC–cys
is very similar to that of MDAC–cys. The highest Qe value obtained for NDAC–cys was 1011 mg/g when
2500 ppm As(III) concentration was used, while the lowest Qe value was only 2.95 mg/g when 10 ppm As(III)
concentration was present. Similar results between MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys indicated that at low As(III) concentrations,
adsorption is the dominant mechanism for removal of As(III), while
at high As(III) concentration (>500 ppm), mineralization becomes
the
dominant mechanism.

Comparison between MDAC–cys, NDAC–cys, and Other
Adsorbents
The comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity
(Qm) from varying adsorbents is shown
in Table 2. Is this
table, the maximum adsorption capacity values (Qm) for MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys were estimated using
the adsorption data in the concentration range of 50–250 ppm,
where the mineralization process did not take place. The calculated Qm value of MDAC–cys is 344.82 mg/g and
NDAC–cys is 357.14 mg/g, which are higher than most reported
values. For example, activated coconut carbon79 has a Qm of 146.3 mg/g at 600 ppm, and
Fe (III) particles,80 Ferrihydrite,81 and Fe3O4-based nanoparticles82,83 have Qm between 63 and 266 mg/g in a
relatively narrow As(III) concentration range (1–50 ppm). There
are also reports on As removal using thiol groups in functionalized
materials such as thiol-modified chitosan beads9 and chitin nanofibers.40 However,
these materials have only shown Qm values
between 2.5 and 149 mg/g, which are significantly lower than those
of DAC–cys
and NDAC–cys.
Aided by the mineralization process, both MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys
substrates have shown very high removal efficiency. For example, the
removal efficiency is 982 mg/g for MDAC–cys and 1011 mg/g for
MDAC–cys at 2500 ppm of As(III).

The similar As(III)
removal efficiencies between MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys suggests
that MDAC–cys is clearly a more practical and cost-effective
system for As(III) remediation in water. In fact, there can be unique
advantages of using the microfiber format of cellulose if the internal
surface area in the scaffold is high (i.e., the fiber is partially
defibrillated but still maintains the overall integrity). The advantages
include the less processing steps with significant saving in chemicals,
water, and energy, as well as the easy handling ability during the
adsorption operation.

Conclusions
Two nanostructured cellulose-based adsorbents:
MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys were demonstrated using wood pulp as the starting
material. These two adsorbents exhibited similar but excellent As(III)
removal efficiencies because of the small difference in the thiol
(sulphur) content between MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys, which
was about 12.70 and 17.15%, respectively. The slight decrease in the
adsorption capacity of NDAC–cys for As(III) as compared to
MDAC–cys could be because of the aggregation of NDAC–cys.
The removal efficiencies of As(III) by MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys
were found to increase with the As(III) concentration. At low As(III)
concentrations (<500 ppm), the remediation process was dominated
by the adsorption of As(III) on l-cysteine, while at high
As(III) concentrations (>500 ppm), the remediation process was
dominated
by the mineralization of As(III) into As2O3 nanocrystals
with different polymorphs (arsenolite on MDAC–cys and claudetite
II on NDAC–cys). The adsorption results of MDAC–cys
and NDAC–cys could be well described by the Freundlich isotherm
model. However, their maximum adsorption capabilities were estimated
using the data at the low concentration range (50–250 ppm):
344.82 mg/g for MDAC–cys and 357.14 mg/g for NDAC–cys.
These values are significantly higher than all the reported values
in the literature. The similar As(III) removal efficiencies between
MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys suggests that the fabrication
pathway based on the microfiber format is clearly a more practical
and cost-effective means to produce biomass-based adsorbents for As(III)
remediation in water.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cellulose derived from wood pulp was obtained
from Georgia Pacific Ltd. USA. TEMPO reagent, sodium periodate (NaIO4), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl), l-cysteine, sodium (meta)arsenite (NaAsO2), sodium
hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chlorite (NaClO2), sodium hypochlorite
(NaClO), and sodium bromide (NaBr) (analytical or reagent grade) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Dialysis tubes (44 and 28 mm) with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO)
of 6–8 kDa were obtained from Spectrum Laboratory BioTech.
Deionized (DI) water was used in all the experimental procedures.

Preparation of MDAC
The preparation of MDAC was carried
out using the method demonstrated by Lindh et al.59 In this method, the wood pulp cellulose fiber was first
grinded into a small length (<2 mm) using a microfine grinder analytical
mill. Then, 5 g of the cellulose sample was suspended in 200 mL water
to react with 1.3 times equivalent of NaIO4 (8.25 g) for
16 h under vigorous stirring. To avoid decomposition of sodium periodate
and photo oxidation, the reaction was carried out in dark throughout
the preparation procedure. Temperature of the reaction mixture was
maintained at 55 °C using a water bath. After the reaction, oxidized
cellulose samples were filtered by a microfiltration filter and then
purified thoroughly using a dialysis bag (MWCO: 6–8 kDa) in
a 3 L water tank. DI water was changed frequently in this tank until
the conductivity reached below 5 μS. A part of the product was
freeze-dried for analysis.

Preparation of the MDAC–cys Complex
The MDAC–cys
complex was prepared by a simple reaction as demonstrated previously.40,41 In this preparation, 1 g of MDAC (dried weight) was suspended in
200 mL of water under constant stirring at 39 °C (in water bath).
Then, 1.67 g of l-cysteine (2 equiv) was added into the MDAC
suspension, where the suspension was stirred continuously for 5 h
to complete the reaction. The final product was separated by microfiltration
and purified by dialysis. Part of the MDAC–cysteine adsorbent
sample was also freeze-dried for analysis.

Preparation of CNFs from Cellulose
CNFs were prepared
by the TEMPO-mediated oxidation method as follows.49 10 g of wood-based cellulose was first grinded into a small
length (<2 mm) and the sample was then soaked in DI water (about
960 mL) overnight, followed by addition of sodium bromide (1.0 g)
and the TEMPO agent (0.20 g). After 15 min of stirring, 100 mmoL of
sodium hypochlorite solution (10 mmol per gram of cellulose) was added
to initiate the oxidization process. The reaction was under mechanical
stirring in a sealed bottle for 24 h at room temperature and the pH
level was monitored and maintained around 10 by addition of 1 M NaOH
solution. The reaction was then quenched using 4 mL ethanol. Subsequently,
the oxidized cellulose sample was purified by dialysis with DI water,
until the conductivity of water reached below 5 μS. The oxidized
cellulose sample was further defibrillated using a homogenizer at
300 Pa for 10 min to obtain the CNF suspension. Part of the CNF sample
was freeze-dried for further characterization.

Preparation of NDAC
NDAC was prepared by the periodate
oxidation of CNFs. In brief, 5.28 g of NaIO4 was added
to 200 mL CNF suspension (1.6 wt %) at 55 °C using a water bath.
The reacting mixture was stirred for 16 h in dark to complete the
reaction. Subsequently, the product was purified by dialysis and then
freeze-dried.

Preparation of the NDAC–cys Complex
The NDAC–cys
complex was prepared by mixing l-cysteine (0.872 g, 2 equiv)
with NDAC suspension (100 mL, 0.522 wt %) under stirring in a sealed
bottle. After 5 h of reaction at 39 °C, the NDAC–cys product
was formed, which was then purification by dialysis until the excess
reactants were removed. Again, freeze-drying was used to prepare the
solid NDAC–cys sample for the remediation test.

As(III) Remediation Study
For the As(III) remediation
measurement, a series of As(III) solutions with different concentrations
(10–2500 ppm) were made by diluting the 0.1 M NaAsO2 stock solution with neutral DI water (pH ≈ 7). The remediation
tests for both MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys were carried out
by mixing 1 mg of freeze-dried powder sample with 2 mL of As(III)
solution at different concentrations. After 24 h of contact time,
the floc was formed and settled at the bottom of the test vial. Both
the floc and upper layer supernatant were collected separately for
characterizations.

Determine the Adsorption Capacity
The values of As(III)
removal efficiency for both MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys samples
were calculated based on the difference between the initial and final
As(III) concentrations divided by the final As(III) concentration
[measured by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS)]. The ideal adsorption
capacity of MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys were determined by
the amount of As(III) (mg) in solution and the amount of MDAC–cys
(g) and NDAC–cys (g) used in the experiment, assuming that
MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys could remove all As(III) from
the solution. The experimental adsorption capacity was the product
of the percent efficiency and the ideal adsorption capacity.34

Sample Characterization Methods
The details of the
varying characterization techniques are described in the Supporting Information. In brief, the mechanisms
of the As(III) removal from water by MDAC–cys and NDAC–cys
were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Spectrum One), 13C CPMAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Bruker Ultrashield
500 MHz), elemental analysis (Thermo Finnigan, Model FLASH EA 1112),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, PerkinElmer STA-6000), SEM (Zeiss
LEO 1550 SFEG-SEM) with EDS capability, TEM (FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit
BioTwin), AFM (Bruker OTESPA tip 10 nm), BET surface (Quantachrome),
and WAXD (Benchtop Rigaku MiniFlex 600) techniques. The supernatant
from the remediation experiment was also characterized by the AFS
(LUMINA 3300) technique. The dried floc samples were analyzed by FTIR, SEM, and wide-angle XRD measurements.
