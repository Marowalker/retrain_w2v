In this study, we investigated the
gauge factor and compressive
modulus of hybrid nanocomposites of exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets
(xGnP) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a polydimethylsiloxane
matrix under compressive strain. Mechanical and electrical tests were
conducted to investigate the effects of nanofiller wt %, the xGnP
size, and xGnP:MWCNT ratio on the compressive modulus and sensitivity
of the sensors. It was found that nanofiller wt %, the xGnP size,
and xGnP:MWCNT ratio significantly affect the electromechanical properties
of the sensor. The compressive modulus increased with an increase
in the nanofiller wt % and a decrease in the xGnP size and xGnP:MWCNT
ratio. However, the gauge factor decreases with a decrease in the
nanofiller wt % and xGnP size and an increase in the xGnP:MWCNT ratio.
Therefore, by investigating the piezoresistive effects of various
factors for sensing performance, such as wt %, xGnP size, and xGnP:MWCNT
ratio, the concept of one- and two-dimensional hybrid fillers provides
an effective way to tune both mechanical properties and sensitivity
of nanocomposites by tailoring the network structure of fillers.

Introduction
Carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes
(CNTs), carbon black
(CB), graphite, and graphene exhibit outstanding electrical properties
and can easily form electrically conductive networks in various nonconductive
polymer materials under the application of an external force.1−18 These unique properties of carbon nanomaterials have been utilized
for the development of sensitive strain sensors responding to external
forces (compression, tension, etc.). For realizing the practical applications
of carbon nanomaterials for the development of sensing devices, carbon
nanocomposites consisting of a matrix and carbon nanofillers have
been used. Especially, various efforts have also been made to functionalize
carbon nanofillers for enhancing their electromechanical properties.
The carbon fillers such as CNTs,2,19,20 functionalized CNTs,21,22 CB,8,10,23,24 graphite,11,25−27 and graphene28−32 have been used to fabricate nanocomposites for sensing devices.
The dispersion of nanofillers in the matrix and their properties and
sensing capabilities can be optimized by controlling the processing
conditions, raw material properties, nanofiller weight fraction (wt
%), nanofiller conductivity, and barrier height of the polymer matrix.33−37 The electrical properties of these carbon nanomaterials in nonconductive
polymers have been investigated and verified by the tunneling effect
to characterize the sensing capability of randomly distributed carbon
nanoparticles in polymer matrices.38−43 However, in all the previous studies carried out in this context,
a single carbon nanomaterial was used in the polymer matrix. Recently,
hybrid nanocomposites consisting of two types of carbon nanomaterials
have been reported.4,11,44,45 These hybrid nanocomposites showed better
mechanical properties, optical energy densities, and piezoresistivities
than nanocomposites consisting of a single carbon nanomaterial in
the polymer. However, the material properties of these nanocomposites
limit their practical applications due to their flexibility and sensitivity
under compression. Sensing performance and mechanical properties of
the hybrid nanocomposites consisting of carbon black and CNTs have
been investigated, but there has been rather limited research on the
electromechanical properties of flexible nanocomposites consisting
of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) fillers under compressive
loading.46−49 It would be of great research interest to investigate the physical
interactions between the 1D and 2D nanofillers and how they affect
the conductive path formation and piezoresistivity. It is also important
to understand the correlation between the geometries, for example,
length and lateral dimensions, of 1D and 2D conductive nanofillers
and the electromechanical properties of hybrid nanocomposites. In
this study, we fabricated a compressive strain sensor using a hybrid
nanocomposite consisting of 1D multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) and 2D exfoliated
graphite nanoplatelets (xGnPs) in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix.
The MWCNTs and xGnPs interacted easily with each other under compression.
We also investigated the piezoresistive effect of the composite sensor
and the synergistic effect of the MWCNTs and xGnPs on the electrical
and mechanical properties of the hybrid nanocomposites. We used xGnPs
with different diameters (M5 or M15) and MWCNTs (CM250) at various
concentrations (wt %) for the preparation of the hybrid nanocomposites.
The relationship between the electrical properties and mechanical
compressive strain of the sensors was also investigated. Therefore,
this study will be helpful for developing hybrid nanocomposite compression
sensors.

Results and Discussion
We fabricated flexible piezoresistive
compression sensors with
nanofiller wt %, two types of xGnPs with a difference in size, and
various xGnP:MWCNT ratios (Table 1). Fabricated samples are easily deformed in compression
for their flexibility and show piezoresistive effect. The electrical
properties of nanocomposites were optimized by controlling the dispersion
and distribution of carbon nanofillers in the matrix (Scheme 1). For dispersing carbon nanofillers
in the polymer matrix, carbon nanofillers and PDMS are poured into
a paste cup, and the resulting mixture was homogeneously dispersed
using a paste mixer (500 revolutions and 400 rotations). After stirring
it for 30 min, the mixture was further dispersed using the three-roll
mill process with intense mechanical stirring. This mechanical stirring
process was repeated more than 10 times. The well-dispersed mixture
was then transferred to a mold. Mixtures consisting of carbon nanofillers
in the polymer matrix were solidified at a high temperature (120 °C)
and pressure (0.5 MPa) to finally obtain the hybrid nanocomposites
with smooth surfaces and evenly dispersed carbon nanomaterials in
the polymer matrix. The composites had a width, length, and height
of 20, 20, and 1 mm, respectively. Finally, two Cu sheet electrodes
were pasted at the top and bottom of the nanocomposites, and a mechanical
force was applied to measure the z-axis resistance
variations of the composites.

To investigate the
behaviors of the carbon nanomaterials (xGnPs
and MWCNTs) in the polymer matrix under compression, we characterized
the composite for investigating material interaction under compression
by using Raman spectroscopy. Hybrid nanocomposites were placed between
two cover glasses to measure the characteristic band changes of carbonaceous
materials under compression as shown in Figure 1a. The sample surfaces were irradiated with
a laser operating at 532 nm. To apply compressive stresses on the
nanocomposites, two equal weights were placed on the cover glass symmetrically.
The weights were increased in 200 g steps from 0 to 400 g, and Raman
spectra were obtained in each step. Raman spectra exhibiting the G,
D, and 2D peaks of pristine CNTs and xGnPs and the C–H peak
of PDMS are shown in Figure 1b. The 2D peaks for the hybrid nanocomposites were recorded
after each weight increasing step. As compressive loads are applied
to a nanocomposite (xGnP:MWCNT ratio of 5:5 was chosen as an example),
Raman spectra shows 2D peak shifts as evidenced in Figure 1c, which indicates load transfer
from the polymer matrix to carbon nanomaterials.50,51 As a reference, an identical measurement was performed on the MWCNT/PDMS
composite film, and the respective Raman spectra are shown in Figure 1d, which shows a
similar trend in 2D peak shifts as hybrid nanocomposites. The compressive
strains induced altering the geometric configurations of CNTs and
xGnPs due to the interfacial adhesion between the carbon nanomaterials
and PDMS. As the compressive load increases, the 2D peak of nanocomposites
shows a blue shift, that is, a decrease in wavelength. The results
demonstrate the spatial rearrangements of the carbon nanomaterials
under compressive loading, and the interfacial adhesion is the underlying
mechanisms that contribute to the piezoresistive behavior, which enables
the hybrid nanocomposites to serve as compression sensors.

To evaluate the electromechanical
properties of the xGnP/MWCNT/PDMS
nanocomposites, two copper electrodes were attached to the top and
bottom surfaces of the samples using a conductive epoxy bond to obtain
accurate electric signals during the compression test (Figure 2a). An acrylic plate was fixed
to the aluminum compression zig to prevent the sensor output from
electric signal interferences (Figure 2b).

To investigate the hybrid effect of the 1D MWCNTs and 2D xGnPs
in hybrid nanocomposites, we used filler 1 and 3 wt %, various xGnP
sizes, and xGnP:MWCNT ratios. Figure 3 shows the conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite
consisting of the M15 xGnPs (large surface area (Figure 4a)) was higher than that of
the composite consisting of the M5 xGnPs (small surface area (Figure 4b)) regardless of
the xGnP:MWCNT ratio. The large surface area of M15 xGnP increases
the number of contact points between MWCNTs and xGnPs, which facilitate
the formation of conductive network under compression. In addition
to the xGnP size effect, the conductivities of the xGnP M5 or M15/MWCNT/PDMS
composites with various fillers ratios (7:3, 5:5, and 2:8) change
with the composition of xGnP and MWCNT. An increase in the xGnP:MWCNT
ratio resulted in a decrease in the conductivity of the hybrid composites,
affecting compression sensing capabilities of the sensor due to a
difference in initial resistance. In extremely low electrical conductivity,
the electric responses of the sensor could hardly form conductive
networks and were hampered by environmental (thermal or vibration)
fluctuations. On the other hand, in very high electrical conductivity,
the adverse effect of the contact resistance increases, and the sensitivity
of the sensor decreases. Proper conductivity is very important in
sensor design for sensing performance. The hybrid composite containing
1 wt % M15 xGnPs shows higher conductivity than that containing 1
wt % M5 xGnPs. This high conductivity facilitates the formation of
new conductive networks under compression and influences sensitivity
of the sensor. The 3 wt % hybrid nanocomposites, on the other hand,
show too many conductive paths in the polymer matrix by lowering the
sensitivity of the sensor. The generation of these conductive paths
determines sensitivity of the sensor in response to compressive stress.
This indicates that the proper conductivity of the composites affects
the sensitivity of the sensor under compression. For the same reason,
the effect of xGnP size is explained by the formation of conductive
networks in the polymer matrix, affecting the sensitivity of the sensor.
In addition to change of wt % and xGnP size, sensor sensitivity increases
with an increase in their xGnP:MWCNT ratios. Nanocomposites with an
xGnP:MWCNT ratio of 7:3 could readily form conductive networks under
compression due to the strong interaction between the filler particles
(Scheme 2). This bridge
effects induced by the combination of the 1D and 2D nanofillers are
observed in all kinds of samples under compression regardless of the
xGnP size and wt % depending on the xGnP:MWCNT ratio. In terms of
flexibility, Figure 5 shows that the rate of compressive stress increases with a decrease
in the xGnP:MWCNT ratio regardless of the xGnP size and wt %. On the
other hand, the sensitivity of the hybrid nanocomposites increases
with an increase in the xGnP:MWCNT ratio (Figure 6). Thus, changes of flexibility and conductivity
depending on the xGnP:MWCNT ratio determine the sensor sensitivity
under compression. The amount of filler (wt %) significantly affects
the mechanical and electrical properties of the hybrid nanocomposites.
With an increase in the filler weight fraction from 1 to 3 wt % (Figure 5a–d), compressive
stress of the composites increased when samples were subjected to
the same compressive strain because the compressive load could be
easily transferred from the polymer matrix to the filler. The sensitivity
of nanocomposites increased with a decrease in the filler wt % because
saturated conductive networks disturb the formation of additional
conductive networks under compression (Figure 6a–d).

nanocomposites as a function

Figure 7 shows five
compressive loading–unloading cycles exerted on hybrid nanocomposites,
strained up to ∼1%. The relative resistance decreased with
increasing compressive strains and was fully recovered upon releasing
unloading in both M15 (Figure 7a) and M5 (Figure 7b) xGnP hybrid nanocomposites.

(1 wt %) and (b) M5/CM250 7:3 (1 wt %).

To better understand the effect of the amount of nanofiller on
polymer, size of the nanofiller, and the ratio of the hybrid nanofiller,
we compared compressive modulus depending on wt %, xGnP:MWCNT ratio,
and xGnP size. Figure 8a shows that the compressive modulus increase is more obvious when
wt % of filler in polymer increases. To illustrate the influence of
xGnP size on mechanical properties, we used different sizes of xGnP,
with 3 times the diameter difference, as the filler. Increasing compressive
modulus can be observed with decreasing xGnP size in the nanocomposites
containing hybrid fillers. The M5 xGnP could interact easily with
the MWCNTs in the polymer matrix under compression as compared to
the M15 xGnP in the same wt %. Regardless of xGnP size, we observed
that, as the weight ratio of MWCNT in hybrid composites increases,
the compressive modulus increases due to entanglement of MWCNT in
fillers. Thus, the compressive modulus of the hybrid composites was
determined by interaction between nanofillers.

Figure 8 Compressive modulus (a)
and gauge factors (b) of the hybrid nanocomposites
with different xGnP sizes and weight fractions (1 and 3 wt %), xGnP:MWCNT
ratios (7:3, 5:5, 2:8, and 0:10).

For comparing sensitivity of the sensor under compression, the
sensor sensitivity was quantified by the gauge factor defined as 1  where ΔR is
the relative
change in electrical resistance, R0 is
the initial electrical resistance, and ε is the compressive
strain.

As shown in Figure 8b, wt %, xGnP:MWCNT ratio, and xGnP size influence
the response to
compressive strain. The gauge factor was mainly affected by the tunneling
effect, which was strongly related to the distance between the nanofillers
in the matrix under the compressive strain. The gauge factor of the
sensor decreases with an increase in nanofiller weight fraction due
to differences in flexibility. The flexibility of the nanocomposite
depends on the CNT content in hybrid fillers, which also affects the
sensitivity of the sensor. Increasing CNT content in the nanocomposites
containing hybrid fillers weakens the sensitivity of the sensing in
1 and 3 wt % nanocomposites. Flexibility of the hybrid nanocomposite
is also related to xGnP size. The hybrid composite with 1 wt % M15
xGnPs shows a higher gauge factor than the composite with 1 wt % M5
xGnPs under compression, showing the xGnP size effect. However, it
can be seen that high conductivity due to high wt % affects the gauge
factor. The results of changing CNTs and xGnP network structure, such
as compressive modulus and gauge factor of nanocomposites, are summarized
in Figure 9. As wt
% of nanofillers increases, it reaches a point where additional conductive
pathways do not significantly affect piezoresistivity under compression,
while compressive modulus continues to increase. Figure 9 also illustrates the hybrid
effect that it enables the formation of a conductive pathway via bridging
the gaps between neighboring CNTs, which exhibit high gauge factors
in hybrid nanocomposites compared to that in CNT composites. Therefore,
flexibility and conductivity, which are influenced by wt %, hybrid
filler ratio, and filler size, affect the electromechanical properties
of the hybrid nanocomposites.

Conclusions
The electrical and mechanical properties of
hybrid nanocomposites
consisting of xGnPs, MWCNTs, and PDMS polymer under compression were
investigated. An increase in the weight fraction of the nanofillers
increased the compressive modulus and decreased the gauge factor of
the composites. This indicates that the filler weight fraction affected
the mechanical properties of the composites, while their compression
sensitivity was affected by the formation of additional conductive
networks during compression. The xGnP size affects the electrical
and mechanical properties of the hybrid nanocomposites. The nanocomposite
with the M5 xGnPs shows better mechanical properties than that with
the M15 xGnPs. However, the electrical properties of the composites
depend on both the size and wt % of the nanofiller. In addition to
these factors, the mechanical and electrical properties of hybrid
nanocomposites were strongly related to the xGnP:MWCNT ratio regardless
of the size and wt % of the nanofiller. The compressive modulus of
the nanocomposites increases with a decrease in the xGnP:MWCNT ratio.
This is because the dense 1D fillers strongly interlocked the 2D fillers
and the polymer in low xGnP:MWCNT ratios. With an increase in the
xGnP:MWCNT ratio, the gauge factor of nanocomposites increases because
the “preplaced” 2D conductive fillers easily interacted
with the 1D conductive fillers under compression. Hence, it can be
stated that the xGnP size, xGnP:MWCNT ratio, and nanofiller wt % affect
the compressive modulus and sensitivity of the nanocomposites under
compression.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
xGnPs (M5 and M15) used in this study
were provided by XG Sciences. These xGnPs showed excellent electrical
conductivity (parallel to surface: 107 S/m, perpendicular
to surface: 102 S/m), a thickness of 6–8 nm, and
average particle diameters of 5 (M5) and 15 μm (M15). The MWCNTs
(CM250) used in this study were provided by Hanwha Chemical (Incheon,
Korea). These MWCNTs had a length of 60–70 μm and a diameter
of 3.5–4 nm. The MWCNTs showed a high aspect ratio (2 ×
104), electrical conductivity (107 S/m), and
dispersibility, which are important properties for sensor filler materials.
The PDMS silicon-based organic polymer used as the matrix was purchased
from SaeHwang Hi-tech. It showed a very low glass transition temperature
(−125 °C), low shrinkage rate, ease of fabrication, and
elastomer characteristics. The flexibility and sensitivity of the
sensor fabricated in this study, which could be easily deformed by
compressive strain, depended on the properties of the PDMS matrix.

Characterization
The morphologies of the hybrid nanofillers
were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM; S-4800, Hitachi). Raman spectra were measured by scattered
radiation of different wavelengths (confocal Raman; alpha300R, WlTec).
For measurement of compression behavior of the sample, cover glass
and weight enable us to measure Raman spectra at pressures down to
several compression forces. The electrical conductivity of nanocomposites
was measured by a four-point probe (CMT-SR1000N). The compression
tests were carried out on a universal material testing system (Instron
5982) at a compressive strain speed of 1 mm/min at ambient temperature.
The electrical signals were captured using a Keithley 2002 multimeter
and a 7001-switching system, which were operated by programmed data
acquisition software for compression.
