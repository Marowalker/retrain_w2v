Systematic
magnetic, electronic, and electrical studies on the
Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O cell structure grown on (001) sapphire by the pulsed laser deposition
technique show that the Cu multivalent (CuM+) ions modulate
magnetic and resistive states of the cells. The magnetic moment is
found to be reduced by ∼30% during the high resistance state
(HRS) to low resistance state (LRS) switching. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy results reveals an increase of the Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation state ratio (which has been determined by the
relative positions of the Fermi level and the Cu acceptor level) during
the HRS to LRS transition. This decreases the effective spin-polarized
Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ channels
and thus the magnetic moment. A conduction mechanism involving the
formation of conductive filaments from the coupling of the CuM+ ions and Vö has been suggested.

1 Introduction
Tuning magnetic properties
by external means without varying temperature
would be highly anticipated from fundamental and technological perspectives.
It has been a long quest to regulate the magnetic properties of solids
by electric fields. Voltage-induced magnetic modulations can be much
more dynamically efficient than that of magnetic fields or spin-polarized
currents. The electric-field manipulation of magnetism is of major
concern not only because of its technological significance but also
because it motivates to reveal properties of magnetic materials that
are otherwise inaccessible. Similarly, electrically controlled resistive
switching (RS) has potential applications in resistive switching random
access memory (RRAM), which is a promising candidate for next-generation
nonvolatile memory devices. RRAM is generally modulated by electrical
stimulus for the recording of “0” and “1”
logic states by changing resistance modes of the material under observation.1,2 Simultaneous control on magnetism and resistance of single-phase
materials can be much beneficial for spintronic devices. In such devices,
an external field switches resistance between a high resistance state
(HRS) and low resistance state (LRS), which in turn modulates magnetic
properties in a reversible and nonvolatile manner.3−7

ZnO is an academically curious material and
has been much celebrated
from both fundamental understanding and application points of view.
In addition to the excellent optoelectronic properties, it has been
demonstrated that both undoped and transition metal doped ZnO systems
show coexistence of resistive and magnetic switching under an applied
electric field when sandwiched between Ti, Pt, Au, indium tin oxide
glass, and SrRuO3 electrodes.8−11 In these systems, electric and
magnetic modulations are generally derived, either by metal electrodes
or by the oxide formation at the interface. Growth of ZnO films on
a metal or structurally different material introduces defects thereby
suppressing the actual role of the ZnO matrix. ZnO would be more appropriate
for applications once the metallic electrodes can be replaced with
a similar crystal structure as that of ZnO. It would also be useful
from the processing perspective if the electrodes and the dielectric
layers are based on a single material system. Gallium-doped ZnO films
show metallic conductivity with the Fermi level position above the
conduction band edge of ZnO and, therefore, can be much better replacement
for metal electrodes.12

To avoid
magnetic oxide formation at the interface, selection of
nonmagnetic elements can be of good use. The ZnO/Cu thin film is a
potential candidate for resistive switching properties.5 The Cu dopant is important because neither metallic
Cu nor its oxides are ferromagnetic at room-temperature.13 Ferromagnetism (FM) can arise in the ZnO/Cu
system because of certain types of defect states. Point defects such
as oxygen vacancy (Vö), Cu–Vö, CuM+ ions, and electrochemical reduction of Cu play
vital roles in controlling RS and FM in the ZnO/Cu system.14−16 Therefore, mutual FM and RS in the single phase ZnO/Cu material
would be interesting from application and fundamental understanding
points of view. Different models have been suggested to interpret
the RS mechanism including charge trapping/detrapping,16,17 conductive filament formation/rupture controlled either by thermal
effects18 or by electrochemical redox reactions.7,19,20 Although the electrochemical
redox reaction-regulated filament is much celebrated, there is still
lack of systematic study to reveal the actual role of the redox reaction
in tuning RS and FM in ZnO/Cu thin films. Therefore, we have performed
comprehensive I–V, magnetization,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses to understand
the magnetic and resistive switching properties of ZnO/Cu thin film-based
cell structure.

2 Results and Discussion
In the present study, Al/Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/c-sapphire were grown using the pulsed
laser deposition method (as shown in the inset of Figure 1) with the oxygen pressure
of P(O2) = 0.02 Pa. In a previous study,21 we have systemically studied Cu0.04Zn0.96O films grown on c-sapphire and found that growing the samples at
P(O2) = 0.02 Pa yielded the films with good epitaxial quality
and largest magnetization. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum (with
diffraction intensity in log scale) of the Cu0.04Zn0.96O grown on top of Ga0.01Zn0.99O and
that of bare Ga0.01Zn0.99O films are shown in Figure 1. Other than (002)
and (004) peaks of wurtzite ZnO and the (006) peak of sapphire, no
other peak is found. The as-received structures are single phase,
and comparatively lower (002) peak intensity of Cu0.04Zn0.96O than that of Ga0.01Zn0.99O may
be related to the degraded epitaxial quality because of Cu doping.21 Hall effect measurements performed on the bare
Ga0.01Zn0.99O film yielded a degenerately high
electron concentration of 2 × 1020 cm–3 and a low resistivity of (∼5 × 10–4 Ω cm). The Ohmic behavior of the bare Ga0.01Zn0.99O film was also confirmed by I–V measurements. The Ga0.01Zn0.99O
film serves as the bottom electric contact and the Cu0.04Zn0.96O film grown on top of it could have a better epitaxial
quality because both the Cu0.04Zn0.96O and Ga0.01Zn0.99O films have the same ZnO wurtzite structure.

the Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001) sapphire and Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001) sapphire.
Inset shows the schematic of the cell structure.

For the I–V measurements,
we first tested sweeping voltages of magnitude ±2 and ±4
V to analyze any transition and memory effects in the I–V characteristics of the designed cell structure
as shown in Figure 2. The sweep voltages were applied to the top electrode of the Al/Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99/(001)
sapphire structure in the sequence 0 → +V → 0 →
−V → 0, whereas the bottom electrode of the Al/Ga0.01Zn0.99/(001) sapphire structure were grounded.
For the fresh cell structure, the original state is HRS. We observe
smooth transitions in the I–V curves without the electroforming process under two sweeping voltages.
Electroforming is a pretreatment process to decrease the cell’s
resistance by several orders via formation of conducting filaments
in the insulating matrix and is considered as a serious obstacle in
realizing high-density RRAM devices. One of the substantial importances
of the present cell structure is its avoidance of the electroforming
process under sweeping voltages of different magnitudes. Figure 2 shows that for the
tested sweeping voltages, current rises steadily only in the positive
voltage regions, whereas in the negative voltage regions, the current
is extremely low and the cell structure remain in the HRS. Comparatively,
±2 V sweeping voltage shows negligible transitions in the I–V curves without any memory effect
(inset in Figure 2)
revealing that the applied sweeping voltage is not sufficient enough
to change the resistance states of the cell structure. On the other
hand, ±4 V sweeping voltage demonstrates high transition in the I–V curves along with observable
memory effects (inset in Figure 2).

the Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001)
sapphire cell structure collected under different sweeping voltages.
Inset shows log I vs V memory effect
for the same structure collected under different positive voltage
regions only.

The preliminary I–V analysis
shows that the application of ±4 V sweeping voltage to the cell
structure gives smooth I–V transitions with a noticeable memory effect. Therefore, we employed
±4 V sweeping voltage to analyze the resistive switching behavior
and magnetic modulation effects in the present cell structure. The
±4 V sweep voltage was applied to the Al/Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001) sapphire (top
electrodes) in the sequence 0 → +4 V → 0 → −4
V → 0, whereas the Al/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001)
sapphire (bottom electrodes) were grounded. Figure 3 shows that when ±4 V sweep voltage
is applied in multiple loops, the I–V plot retraces itself in both sweep directions. For very
first sweeping cycle, when the positive voltage imposed on the cells
increases steadily, a pronounced rise in current (∼10–4 A) is observed at V ≈ +4 V and the cells
switch to LRS. The LRS is retained (ON state) during sweeping back
of voltage from +4 V till negative voltage sweep (0 → −4
V → 0), at which the current switches to extremely low current
∼10–6 A (OFF state). During the second sweeping
cycle, the ON state is again achieved only for the positive sweeping
voltage but the LRS current at a voltage decreases to 9 × 10–5 A. Similarly, the LRS current at a voltage reduces
to 3 × 10–5 A till the 15th sweeping cycle.
However, the voltage required to achieve LRS current remains the same
for all sweeping cycles. For the endurance test (inset in Figure 3), the resistance
values were measured at ±4 V reading voltage in each dc sweep.
Resistance values for LRS show increasing trends against sweeping
cycles, whereas those of HRS are scattered. Although the HRS values
are somewhat fluctuant, the HRS/LRS ratios are still in the range
of ∼102 over 15 cycles. These observations show
that the LRS state retains itself until the negative voltage is applied
to tune the cells to their initial HRS (which is indeed a memory effect)
and shows very low current indicating that Cu doping suppresses HRS
current efficiently.

the Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/(001) sapphire cell structure. Arrows show the direction of sweeping
voltages. Inset shows log resistance vs voltage cycles for the same
cell structure.

Noticeable opening in
the I–V curves (Figure 2)
suggests the possible memory effect of the measured cell structure
rather than the rectification characteristics. To further ensure the
memory effect, the cells were switched to LRS by +4 V and the electrical
bias was then detached. Then, I–V measurement was then performed with a much smaller bias (0.3–0.5
V). Similarly, we switched the cells to HRS by employing −4
V and then detaching the electrical bias. I–V measurement was then carried out with a smaller bias.
The results are shown in Figure 4. We observe a clear bifurcation in the I–V curves of LRS and HRS indicating memory
behavior of the cell structure. In effect, the sample retains its
LRS and HRS until respective states can be swapped by the application
of negative and positive voltages, respectively. Thus, with the +4
V pulse we can “write” the LRS and subsequently the
−4 V pulse “erases” the high conducting state
and recalls the initial HRS. The I–V characteristics measured at different cells on the film
were almost identical in nature showing a high degree of reproducibility.22 However, after the positive bias is detached,
one of the reasons of the quick drop in the current during subsequent
cycles is due to variable locations and orientations of the residual
conducting filaments. This behavior is also shown in the inset of Figure 3 by the scattered
HRS values and increasing trends of the resistance of LRS against
sweeping voltage cycles.

sapphire cell structure after biasing with +4 V and −4 V. The
cell was switched to LRS (HRS) by +4 V (−4 V), and then, the
electric bias was detached. The I–V measurement was then carried out, and the results are
shown in the figure. Difference between the LRS and HRS current shows
memory effect of the cell structure.

In the upcoming section, the effects of RS on magnetic variations
of the cell structure will be discussed, which is the main exploration
of this work. Previously, we have studied the ZnO/Cu thin films grown
under different oxygen partial pressures.21 This study highlighted correlation among the magnetization, Vö defects, and CuM+ ions. Each Vö was found to introduce one large size localized orbital and two
doped electrons. The dopant-defect hybridization generates ferromagnetically
aligned Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks, and a long range ferromagnetic order would develop
in the ZnO/Cu thin films.21,23 Detailed XRD, XPS,
and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and magnetization
studies suggested that thin film quality played a less effective role
in governing the magnetic properties. Instead, room temperature FM
of ZnO/Cu thin film samples are highly tunable by the simultaneous
presence of CuO nanophases and multivalent Cu and Vö concentrations, which are in strong contest with each other.21 For vacuum (P(O2) = 0.0 Pa)-grown
thin film samples containing a high Vö concentration
and Cu+ as the dominant oxidation state, the Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ network became
ineffective and a CuO nanophase (4–5 nm) was the dominant FM
supplier. In case of high oxygen partial pressure (P(O2) = 1.00 Pa) grown sample, the observed FM was very weak and distorted.
The high oxygen supply during thin film growth introduced relatively
larger size nanophases (8–10 nm) of CuO and created a substantial
decrease in the Vö concentration resulting in a
comprehensive reduction of the Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ network. Moreover, we observe that the low
oxygen pressure (i.e. P(O2) = 0.02 Pa) is important during
thin film growth to get enhanced magnetic properties. Withholding
P(O2) = 0.02 Pa during thin film growth, introduces sufficient
amount of Vö with a dominant Cu2+ oxidation
state thereby producing effective Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks as major contributors to FM. On the
other hand, the CuO nanophases if they exist play a less important
role in tuning FM. Therefore, this is one of the primary motivations
for the growth of the present cell structure under P(O2) = 0.02 Pa.

The capability of the present cell structure to
retain the resistive
states allows one to disconnect the sample from the electrical circuit
and measure the magnetization loop. We have carried out RS-induced
magnetic measurement for the as-received state, HRS, and LRS of the
cells as representatively displayed in Figure 5. We first measured room temperature magnetization
on the as-received cell structure without any biasing. To observe
the RS-induced FM, all the cells were switched to the LRS by applying
+4 V. Subsequently, magnetization showed the magnetic moment reduction
of 30% in the LRS of the cells. Then, I–V measurements with a much smaller bias (0.3–0.5
V) on some of the cells showed that they were in the LRS. To check
the reversibility of the magnetic switching, every cell was switched
back to the HRS by employing −4 V and magnetization was reperformed.
Indeed, the magnetic moment can be recovered, indicating reversible
control on magnetism by an electric bias. It should be noted here
that every time the sample was disconnected from the circuit before
execution of magnetic measurements.

forward-biased, and reverse-biased states.

We will now explore the possible origin of ferromagnetic
modulations
by electrical biasing. The Cu acceptor level (0/−) lies 0.18–0.2
eV below the conduction-band minimum (CBM). The (0/−) refers
to the change of the charge state of the Cu from neutral to negatively
charged by losing a hole. The (0/−) ionization state referred
to the transition of Cu2+ to Cu+ as the Fermi
level moves over the (0/−) level, while the Cu+ charge
state is located at 0.390 eV above the valence band.24−26 Recently, charge state switching of Cu acceptors in ZnO nanorods
was observed by the rise in the Fermi level above the 0/– (Cu2+/Cu+) charge transfer level as a result of Ga
donor dopant introduction.26 Therefore,
within the similar framework, the possibility of changing the Fermi
energy level by the electric field effect can clarify the real nature
of the electronic band structure of the ZnO/Cu-based cell structure.
Thus, in the present study of the ZnO/Cu thin film, the EF positions during HRS and LRS were estimated by the equation, n = Nc exp(EF – EC/kT) and n = σ/eμe, where n is the carrier concentration, Nc is the effective density of states at 300
K for ZnO (3.9 × 1018 cm–3), σ
is the conductivity, and μe is the electron mobility
for the Cu0.04Zn0.96O thin film at 300 K (30
cm2 V–1 s–1).27,28 The EF values were found to be about
0.34 and 0.15 eV below the CBM during HRS and LRS, respectively.

From the above discussion, we can infer the existence of CuM+ ions and a higher Cu+/Cu2+ ratio during
the transition from the HRS to LRS because of the rise in the Fermi
level. Along with CuM+ ions, there is sufficient amount
of Vö as the cell structure were grown under low
P(O2) = 0.02 Pa. According to the first-principles calculation,
each Vö introduces one large size localized orbital
and two doped electrons. The doped electrons associated with the Vö would spill over the 3d orbitals of the surrounding
CuM+ ions, making them closer to Cu+.14 Therefore, we propose that the observed FM in
the as-received cells are attributed to the coupling between the electron
trapped by Vö and CuM+ ions via Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks.
Under magnetic field, the spin-polarized Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ channels get aligned and generate
FM. During LRS, moving up of the EF level
over the Cu (0/−) level converts Cu2+ to Cu+, which resulted in the decrease of effective spin-polarized
Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ channels
and thus reduction in FM (∼30%). During HRS, moving down of
the EF level results in more abundant
Cu2+ ions. These Cu2+ ions would generate effective
spin-polarized Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ channels and FM switches back to the original value. To further
investigate the existence of CuM+ ions and their interaction
with Vö in the form of Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ defect complex, XPS measurements
can be much beneficial.

The detailed XPS analysis has been performed
during different states
of the cell structure. First, XPS was performed on the as-received
cell structure without any biasing. To observe electrically induced
changes in XPS spectra, all the cells were switched to the LRS with
forward biasing of +4 V, and subsequently, XPS data were collected.
To check the reversibility of the XPS spectra, every cell was switched
back to the HRS by employing reverse biasing of −4 V, and XPS
data were collected again. Before the XPS measurements, the LRS and
HRS features were carefully checked with similar measurements as shown
in Figure 4, and the
XPS measurements were conducted with the electric bias detached. XPS
survey scans for the as-received state, LRS, and HRS of the cells
are presented in Figure 6. Only Zn, Cu, O, and C elements and no additional peak related to
Al or other elements were detected. The XPS spectra for the as-received
cells in Figure 7 indicate
Cu 2p3/2, Cu 2p1/2, and satellite peaks. After
setting every cell to LRS, the Cu 2p peak intensities reduce and the
satellite peaks disappear. While resetting the sample to HRS, Cu 2p
peaks regain original intensities and satellite peaks reappear (insets
in Figure 7). For all
three states of the cells, the Cu 2p3/2 (933.15–933.22
eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (953.05–953.11 eV) peak positions
show CuM+ ions.29−31 Therefore, each XPS spectrum
is deconvolved into Cu2+ and Cu+ components.
The fittings are accomplished by using Cu2+ and Cu+ components (corresponding to the Cu 2p peak positions of
Cu2+ in CuO and Cu+ in Cu2O).29,32 By employing XPS integrated areas and Cu 2p3/2/Zn 2p3/2 ratio, we obtained Cu atomic % of 0.5, 0.3, and 0.45 for
as-received, forward-biased, and reverse-biased states of the cells,
respectively. The fitting results are presented in Table 1.

Satellite
peaks are commonly found between 940–945 eV for
Cu2+, and no satellite peaks are expected for the Cu0 and Cu+ states.33 The
CuO is normally characterized by broader and high-intensity satellite
peaks at ∼10 eV higher binding energy from the main Cu 2p peaks.21 Satellite peaks ∼9.1–7.9 eV from
the main Cu 2p peaks suggest the absence of the CuO phase; therefore,
Cu2+ is the more dominant oxidation state in the as-received
cells. During LRS, the abundant Cu2+ surface ions drift
down to the bottom electrode and convert to Cu+ after capturing
injected electrons. This is in agreement with upmove of EF during LRS of the cells because of interactions of injected
carriers with Cu2+ ions. These Cu2+ and Cu+ ions couple with Vö efficiently to form
Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks,
which is essentially a process of electrochemical redox reactions.7 The redox reaction is not through Cu movement,
instead electron transfers between Cu2+ and Cu+ via Vö. The Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ defect complexes connect with each other to
form networks and facilitate formation of Cu-based filaments along
conduction paths. These conduction paths set the cells into LRS, thereby
reducing Cu atomic % to 0.3 at the surface. During reverse biasing,
the locally connected Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks are disrupted because of the lack of injected carriers,
and the sample was reset into HRS. At the surface, the Cu atomic %
regains the original value (0.45%) as that of the as-received cell
structure (0.5%) and results in a higher Cu2+/Cu+ ratio. This is again in consonance with the down shift in EF during HRS of the cells.

To further
understand the effects of Vö on the
bonding nature of oxygen with CuM+ ions, we performed O
1s XPS analysis as presented in Figure 8. The irregular features in the O 1s spectra are divided
into subspectral components.34 The O2 and
O3 peak intensities remain quite the same. However, the O1 peak intensity
progressively declines during forward and reverse biasing. This shows
change in the typical behavior of O ions organized in a wurtzite lattice
of hexagonal Zn2+ ions at the surface because of application
of high voltage. By employing integrated areas of O1, O2, and O3 peaks,
relative strength of O2 (i.e., Vö) is estimated
(see Table 1). Setting
cells to LRS stimulates an observable change in the Cu-oxidation states
rather than Vö in the regions around the conducting
filament, which can be easily detected by XPS. In addition, most of
the CuM+ ions and Vö are utilized in
the formation of Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ defect complexes, and these isolated networks accumulate
along the conducting path to form the filament (Figure 9). This process occurs at the expense of
reduction in the isolated spin-polarized Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks in the close proximity
of the conducting filament and magnetic moment reduced to 30%. During
HRS of the cells, the conducting filament ruptures (Figure 9) and isolated Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ effective networks
are available again in the matrix of the ZnO/Cu thin films to tune
the reduced magnetic moments to their original higher values. It seems
here that change in the status of cells can create imbalance of the
isolated spin-polarized Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks within the matrix of the Cu0.04Zn0.96O film. From the present investigation of magnetic
and XPS analyses, it has been observed that during biasing of the
cells, Vö contents remain fixed and change in Cu2+/Cu+ ratios tune magnetic and electronic properties.

cell structure.

Figure 9 Schematic representations
of the conducting filament process for
the as-received, forward-biased, and reverse-biased states of the
cell structure.

In the RS of ZnO, the
Vö has been known to play
a dominant role in controlling the conducting filament.35 Joule heating is considered responsible for
the rupture of Vö-based filament and results in
a sharp transition from LRS to HRS of the cells. We observe smooth
RS and found that the Cu2+ acceptor level can combine efficiently
with Vö, which in turn impedes isolated Vö gathering at the interface.24,25 Moreover, absence of
the electroforming process excludes the possible role of Vö to start the RS modulations.1 The already
existed Cu2+ cations in the as-received cells effectively
save the relatively long-term oxidation of Cu atoms at the anode in
the very first cycle. In addition, the average drift distance between
Cu2+ ions and the cathode is shortened because of the electron
transfer between Cu2+ and Cu+ via Vö orbitals. Both these phenomena accelerate the formation of Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks
along the conduction path and result in avoidance of the electroforming
process.7 These observations suggest that
the conducting filament is not based on the isolated Vö, other entities might also be involved. Hence, it is considered
that rupture/formation of the conducting filament might be due to
the electrochemical redox reactions of doped Cu in ZnO.7

To further investigate the origin of RS,
all the cells were forward-biased
(0 → +4 V → 0), and subsequently, we performed nonlinear
fittings to I–V curves (Figure 10) in the positive
voltage regions. The I–V curves
seem to follow Ohmic conduction, trap-controlled space charge limited
current (SCLC), and Poole–Frenkel (P–F) emission mechanisms
in different voltage regions. In the SCLC, the I–V curve first conforms the Ohmic conduction (I ∞ V) and then Child’s law (I ∞ V2).33,36 At lower voltage (slope ≈ 1.2), current flowing through the
cell is mainly intrinsic and can be explained by the Ohmic conduction
model. With further increase in the voltage (slope ≈ 2), the
injected carriers become predominant, and an increase in current obeys
Child’s law (I ∞ V2). Once all of the traps are filled, a rapid increase
in current is observed at a higher voltage (slope ≈ 4.5), which
is regarded as P–F emission of electrons.37 After P–F emission, the filament is formed because
of the gathering of CuM+ ions and Vö along
the conducting path and the cells switch from HRS to LRS. During reverse
biasing of the cells (0 → −4 V → 0), already
filled defect states exhaust the trapped charges as there is no extra
supply of injected carriers. In this way, already assembled CuM+ ions and Vö along the conducting path
start dispersing and fuses the conducting filaments, thereby switching
the LRS of the cells back to HRS under the negative bias. During subsequent
cycles, the I–V behavior
is nonuniform and the cells become more resistive because of fluctuating
locations and orientations of the residual conducting filaments.

3 Conclusions
From the present study, it can
be concluded that we can electrically
tune the magnetic state of the cell structure for which ferromagnetically
aligned Cu2+–Vö–Cu+ networks are considered responsible in altering the magnetic
state. We observe that RS is essential for electrically driven magnetization
effects and the clear distinction of the two states specifies an opportunity
to read out the magnetic state. The isolated Vö do
not play any role in RS and magnetic modulations; instead, the CuM+ ions coupled with Vö are essential to
tune resistive and magnetic states of the cells by developing the
Cu conducting filament. These observations could be helpful to understand
and control magnetic modulations of the medium that retain robust
Vö-related FM.

4 Experimental
Section
We prepared cell structure from the Ga0.01Zn0.99O and Cu0.04Zn0.96O stoichiometric
compositions
of the targets (∼99.99% purity) by employing a pulsed KrF excimer
laser (λ = 248 nm) with a frequency of 2 Hz and 300 mJ energy.
The background pressure of the growth chamber was 1 × 10–4 Pa, and the growth was conducted in the oxygen partial
pressure P(O2) = 0.02 Pa. Prior to growing the thin film
structure; we measured the room temperature MH loop of the (001) sapphire
crystal substrate to confirm that it was free from magnetic impurity
contamination. We first deposited a buffer layer of the Ga0.01Zn0.99O thin film ∼250 nm on the (001) sapphire
crystal substrate at 600 °C temperature under P(O2) = 0.02 Pa. Subsequently, the Cu0.04Zn0.96O layer with a thickness of ∼250 nm was grown on top of the
Ga0.01Zn0.99/(001) sapphire through shadow-masking
to get the sample size of ∼10 mm × 5 mm. For electrical
and magnetic measurements, ∼50 nm thick Al metal (∼250
μm diameter) Ohmic contacts were deposited on the surfaces of
the Cu0.04Zn0.96O layer with a thermal evaporator
to get the final cell structure of Al/Cu0.04Zn0.96O/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/c-sapphire (inset Figure 1). Resistivity (∼5
× 10–4 Ω cm) and Ohmic behavior of the
Al/Ga0.01Zn0.99O/sapphire acting as the bottom
electrode was carefully checked again. The final single cell size
in the present study is ∼250 μm.

The crystal structures
were investigated by XRD measurements using
a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with the Cu Kα line (0.1541 nm).
The film thickness was measured by employing a Hitachi S-4800 field
emission scanning electron microscope (FEG). The I–V characteristics were measured by a Keithley
Source Meter 2601B. Room temperature magnetic measurements were performed
on a Quantum Design SQUID-VSM (Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device-Vibrating Sample Magnetometer) with the magnetic field parallel
to the film plane. Teflon tweezers were used for sample handling to
prevent magnetic contamination. XPS measurements were carried out
using a Scienta-Omicron XPS instrument equipped with a microfocused
monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and an Argus Analyzer. The
source was operated at 15 keV and with 750 μm spot size, constant
analyzer energy of 100 eV for survey scans and 20 eV for high resolution
scans. The charge neutralization was applied using a combined low
energy to avoid the charging effects, and the XPS data acquisition
was performed with Matrix 3.2. Although XPS spot (750 μm) is
larger than that of the cell size (∼250 μm), we carefully
focused the X-rays on the regions between Al contacts. Data analysis
was performed with IGOR Pro by employing XPS fit procedures. The XPS
curve fitting was done using the Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape
after performing the shrilly background corrections.
