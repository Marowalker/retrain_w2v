1 Introduction
Corrosion
is a big challenge to scientists, as the Gibbs free energy of this
natural process is always negative. Corrosion can cause economic penalties
to critical industrial sectors.1,2 Global corrosion cost
is estimated to be 2.5 trillion USD, equivalent to 3.4% of the gross
domestic product.3 Acidic systems cover
a major portion in the corrosion phenomenon and the related costs
involved in it. One such critical corrosion media is aqueous hydrochloric
acid containing chlorine gas.4

Chlorine
is widely used in industry, 60% of the total chemicals depend upon
the chlorine manufacturing process.5 Of
the 40 million metric ton annual production of chlorine worldwide,
75% goes to industrial practice of chemical manufacturing, namely
poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) manufacturing (30), solvent (24), organic
(13), water, and paper (10).6,7 In all these processes,
hydrochloric acid is generated as a byproduct and chlorine gas is
invariably present in the product or the byproduct mixture. Water
as chlorination media includes major industrial processes namely,
PVC polymerization, chlorination of PVC-producing CPVC8 and water treatment. Presence of water is practically undeniable,
even the process is in non-aqueous media. Corrosion in such reaction
media cause economic setback to the processes. Often, polymers used
either directly in reaction system or as coating on metal surface
is a fruitful option to prevent corrosion.9−12 Yet, the stability
of the polymer at different reaction conditions is a matter of critical
investigation.

Several reports are disclosed about the corrosion
resistivity of polymer materials as coating and construction material.13−15 Concentrated H2SO4,16 concentrated HCl,17,18 chlorinated solvents, or high-temperature hydrochloric acid19−21 are quite common corrosive system
that are well studied; however, study of aqueous hydrochloric acid
containing chlorine gas or as media of industrial chlorination process
are scanty in literature. The present study primarily focuses on understanding
the effect and stability of the materials used for coating and construction
purposes in aqueous hydrochloric acid containing chlorine gas.

Polypropylene (PP), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), ethylene
chloro tetrafluoroethylene (ECTFE), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE),
and epoxy vinyl ester resin (VER, Derakane 470-300) are chosen for
the study. Structural description of these polymers are given in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structure of polymer samples taken for testing.

These materials
are used in various chemical processes involving acidic and corrosion
media. The present study is primarily focused on the effect of these
materials in chlorine-dissolved aqueous hydrochloric acid. Some of
the polymers are used in the shape of cloth and sheet to understand
the effect of exposure. Specimen samples were exposed in the system
for stipulated time period and characterized in detail before and
after the exposure through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
X-ray analysis, and dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Poly(ethylene Terephthalate) (PET)
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has very good barrier and hardness
properties, so it is widely used in packaging,22 coating,23,24 and construction25 material, or as filter in acidic system. The PET cloth
sample when immersed in the present system showed changes.

The
XRD of the PET cloth coupons, before and after, show a noticeable
change (Figure 2).
The 2θ peaks obtained at 16.0, 17.5, 22.5, and 25.5 corresponds
to the reflections from the (01̅0), (010), (110), and (100)
planes for a semicrystalline PET26 shows
an increase in intensity and a shift to a higher 2θ in every
plane of reflections. This results into reduction in the d spacing from 5.29 to 5.26, 5.01 to 4.97, 3.93 to 3.87, and 3.43
to 3.42 Å for (01̅0), (010), (110), and (100) planes, respectively
(Table 1). Also, the
increase in the reflected radiation intensity resulted in a higher
degree of crystallinity. Interestingly, the relative ratio of intensity
was changed to 1.07:1:1.2 to 0.9:1:1.3 of the respective peaks before
and after exposure. The peak at 2θ of 22.5° of the 010
plane corresponds to the increase in the amorphous region with respect
to the crystalline region.27 This may be
indicative of the fact that the surface of PET is affected by the
acidic oxidizing environment.

The SEM pictures show a distinct
difference between fresh and treated PET samples (Figure 3). In addition to the etched
PET surface, the gaps between the strands have been reduced, which
supports the XRD data. Physically, the specimen was observed to be
more opaque and brittle, which is in accordance with one of the reports
that found brittleness of PET when exposed to chlorinated solvents.28

Figure 3 SEM Image of PET polymer
samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

Energy-dispersive X-ray study as shown
in Figure 4 shows a
new peak of Cl after exposure, indicating a chemical attack on the
surface or the polymer chain of PET by chlorination. The C-to-O ratio
of untreated PET is 2.33:1, not far from the theoretical value of
2.5:1 (with respect to −C10H8O4– polymeric unit) (Table 1); little more on −OH ratio as
commercial PET contains more hydroxyl end groups.29 Adherence of molecular chlorine or HCl is ruled out because
the samples were extensively dried before testing. Interestingly,
the oxygen content increased from initial to the exposed specimen.
The moisture content of the dried PET samples was <0.05 wt %, so
adhered water is not the source of oxygen. The oxidation of PET by
HOCl could be the likely cause for the presence of oxygen. HOCl generated
in the system by the reaction of chlorine and water is a highly oxidizing
agent,30 which can initiate the hydroxylation
of PET.31,32

Figure 4 EDX spectra of PET polymer
samples (a) before treatment
and (b) after treatment.

The FTIR spectra (Figure 5) of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
samples before and after treatment clearly distinguish the peak 673
cm–1 in the treated sample correspond to the C–Cl
stretching vibration; the literature reported value of 668 cm–1.33 This distinctively
proves the chlorination reaction of PET during the treatment. The
absence of peak at 3700 cm–1, which corresponds
to the −OH stretching (nonhydrogen bonded)34,35 in
the treated PET, in the untreated sample also proves the hydroxylation
of PET.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra (in transmittance mode) of PET polymer samples
(a) before treatment and (b) after treatment.

The DMA analysis (Figure 6) of fresh PET cloth is in agreement with the literature
value.36 The treated sample shows a 5 °C
lower shift of tan δ maxima (in DMA) from 147.19 to 142.1
°C after the exposure, this may be due to the oxidation of the
PET chain.

Figure 6 DMA graph of PET polymer
samples before treatment
and after treatment.

The test of puncture resistance (ASTM D4833) of fresh
PET cloth shows 781 N, whereas that of the treated PET cloth sample
shows 27 N. Such a huge drop in the strength is evidence of the damage
to the PET polymer chain likely due to chemical attack as seen in
above-mentioned test reports.

2.2 Polypropylene (PP)
Polypropylene (PP), a purely hydrocarbon
polymer, has considerable chemical resistance used as solvent storage
container37 and piping;38,39 therefore,
it was thought to check the stability in the present system. An increase
in the degree of amorphous content and a reduction in crystallinity,
i.e., decrease in intensity, are observed from the XRD pattern of
the PP sample (Figure 7). Peaks at 2θ of 14.41, 17.20, 18.72, and 22.02° comply
with the literature value that correspond to the (110), (040), (130),
(111), and (131) plane reflections.40 The
treated PP shows the peaks at the same position as the untreated one,
but with reduced intensity, this may be indicative of the change in
the polymer structure and orientations. The intensity of the peak
corresponding to the (110) plane is comparatively more reduced, that
is, the bulk orientation of PP polymer becomes less ordered probably
due to the reduced crystallinity in treated PP.41

Figure 7 XRD spectra of PP samples (a) before treatment and (b)
after treatment.

The SEM image of the PP samples (Figure 8) signifies the change in the
surface topography. The roughness and demarcation incurred during
exposure to the present system. The nature of chemical attack is further
substantiated in the EDX spectra (Figure 9), in which the appearance of a chlorine
peak is an evidence of the chlorination reaction in the PP chain.42 Moreover, as seen from the EDX spectra, the
oxygen content in the treated PP is higher than that in the untreated
one. Similar to the PET sample, this observation also dictates the
hydroxylation of the PP chain by HOCl. Interestingly, the atomic ratio
1:1 of Cl to O indicates that HOCl could be responsible for both chlorination
and hydroxylation.

Figure 8 SEM image of PP polymer
samples (a) before treatment and (b) after treatment.

Figure 9 EDX spectra of PP polymer
samples (a) before treatment and (b) after treatment.

The FTIR of PP does not reveal much of information
probably because the C–Cl vibration frequency is masked by
the frequency of the propylene chain sequence and the −CH2– rocking vibrations that appear broadly near 700 cm–1.43,44 However, there is a sharp indication
of a nonhydrogen-bonded −OH stretching at 3734 cm–1 in the treated PP; the peak is likely to be caused due to the hydroxylation
by HOCl.45

tan δ maxima
in the DMA of the PP cloth sample shows a 34 °C upshift from
84 °C to 118 °C after exposure (Figure 10). The likely reason is the chlorination
of the PP polymer chain.46

Figure 10 DMA graph
of PP polymer
samples before treatment and after treatment.

Mechanical
test of treated PP sample produce an inferior puncture resistance
of 66 N with respect to fresh PP cloth sample of 513 N (Table 1). This drop in puncture resistance
supports the chlorination reaction with the polymer chain. The PP
sample becomes more brittle after the exposure.

2.3 ETFE
Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene
copolymer (ETFE) is a copolymer of ethylene. It is mostly used in
coating applications.47 It has got properties
of corrosion resistance, barrier properties, good process ability,
and high operating temperature durability. However, in the present
system, ETFE changes from colorless to white and opaque.

The
XRD pattern of untreated ETFE matches with the literature values,48 which show that a highest peak at 2θ 18.8°
corresponds to the reflection of the (004) plane (Figure 11). A slight decrease in the
intensity and an increase in d spacing from 4.69
to 4.72 Å were observed. The crystallinity was reduced from 96.2
to 85.3%. According to the literature, reflections from (001) and
(003) are weaker and that from (002) is relatively strong.48 However, it can be seen that the (001), (002),
and (003) reflections are of same intensity. Phongtamrug et al. found
a correlation between the ethylene content and d spacing
such that ethylene content less than 50% may be the cause of a larger d spacing.49 Thus, the ethylene
content in ETFE in the present system is reduced from the original
1:1 ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene composition. The change in the
intensity could also be anticipated due to change from orthorhombic
to hexagonal meso phase, as reported in the literature.48

Figure 11 XRD spectra of ETFE
polymer samples (a)
before treatment and (b) after treatment.

Microscopic look of the SEM image dictates
that the topography of the surface nature of the ETFE sample remains
same after exposure (Figure 12). More scratches or dots are observed in untreated sample,
which could be due to the softness of the ETFE.50

Figure 12 SEM image of ETFE polymer
samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

The EDX spectra, shown in Figure 13, do not reveal the presence of chlorine,
but reasonable amount of oxygen is seen in the treated sample. The
presence of fluorine perhaps
is restricted due to chlorination, but oxidative attack could not
be restrained. Although the FTIR matches the literature value with
ETFE characteristic peaks,50 the peak at
3740 cm–1 (Figure 14) designates free nonhydrogen-bonded −OH, which
eventually supports the oxidation. Nevertheless, the ratio of C/F
is maintained at 1:1 as per the molecular formula (Figure 1).

polymer samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

Figure 14 FTIR spectra (in transmittance
mode) of ETFE
polymer samples (a) before treatment and (b) after treatment.

2.4 ECTFE
ECTFE is similar to ETFE, except
that ethylene is copolymerized with chlorotrifluoroethylene and the
benefits of processibility and high molecular weight are obtained.51 The variation in molecular structure
due to chlorine52 may be important to understand
the effect of corrosion behavior and the oxidative stress on chlorinated
acidic water system.

The XRD pattern of ECTFE (Figure 15) matches with the literature
values of 2θ of 5, 10, and 17°.53 However, it shows a dramatic change after the exposure. Crystallinity
of the material is reduced from 96% to 85% after exposure to the system.
It is also evident from the spectra that the peak at 2θ of 10°
has disappeared.

Figure 15 XRD
spectra of ECTFE
polymer samples (a) before treatment and (b) after treatment.

The SEM image (Figure 16) shows a smooth surface of the exposed
sample both before and after the exposure. This signifies no change
in the surface morphology of ECTFE in the present system. The EDX
spectra (Figure 17) reveal that there is no change in oxygen content; however, change
in fluorine, chlorine, and carbon content is observed (Table 1) after exposure in the said
conditions. Also, no change in FTIR was noticed. The oxidative stability
of ECTFE is reported to be higher than that of ETFE, which might be
the likely cause for ECTFE to remain stable in the present system.54

Figure 16 SEM
image of ECTFE polymer
samples (a)
before treatment and (b) after treatment.

Figure 17 EDX spectra of ECTFE
polymer samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

The DMA of ECTFE produce similar thermogram
and keep Tg at 124.2 °C (before treatment)
and 125.8 °C (after treatment), which are matched with the literature
value of 124.6 °C.55 Similar observation
was found in puncture-resistance test. The force exerted was 489 N
before and 433 N after the exposure.

Therefore, it is evident
from the data that the chemical constituents of the ECTFE molecular
chain remain intact in the present system. The probable reason for
the change in the XRD pattern is the morphological change without
affecting the mechanical strength of the polymer specimen.

2.5 Vinyl Epoxy Resin (Derakane
Momentum 470-300)
Vinyl epoxy resin (VER), a highly cross-linked
polymer of bisphenol-A glycidylether and methacrylic acid, was the
first construction material following World War II.56 The VER was competitive over polyester with respect to
the chemical attack and superb chemical resistivity including conc.
H2SO4, chlorine water, HNO3,56 allowing it to apply for chemical vessels, reactors,
etc.

The change in the XRD of the VER sample upon exposure was
not noticeable; in fact, two very broad peaks observed at 2θ
of 19.34 and 18.90°. The microscopic SEM image of the VER sheet
captures the differences in the surface of the specimen, as shown
in Figure 18.

Figure 18 SEM image of VER polymer
samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

This change was further supported by the EDX spectrum, which shows
an increase in the chlorine content after the exposure (Figure 19). Interestingly,
the oxygen content decreased in the treated sample (Table 1). This could be explained in
two ways. First, it can be considered that the chlorine attack is
occurring by replacing oxygen. The decrease in the atom percent of
oxygen was more significant (from 32.38 to 21.38) than the increase
in the atom percent of chlorine (from 0.09 to 5.84) probably because
oxygen is divalent whereas chlorine is monovalent. The second possibility
is the permanent loss of a repeating unit from the polymer chain.
Considering the structure mentioned in Figure 1, a single unit contains C25H36O8 and the loss of one acrylic acid unit provides
a C22H32O6 unit. So, the relative
contribution of oxygen is more from the acrylic acid unit in a single-polymer
chain. However, this is contrary to few reports.57 Thus, the first explanation seems more probable.

Figure 19 EDX spectra of VER polymer
samples (a) before
treatment and (b) after treatment.

Nevertheless, in case of any of the possibilities, the tensile strength
and hardness of the Derakane sheet (Table 1) did not show a significant change. The
DMA analysis also
supports the observation, as is evident by the tan δ
maxima of 125 °C.

2.6 Sheet Versus Cloth Specimen
Depending upon the application,
the same material may be used in different shape and physical form.
With that interest PP was checked
both as cloth and sheet specimen, become the sheet material is applicable
for construction and cloth material is used for filtration purpose.
The cloth sample is severely changed as shown above, whereas the sheet
specimen did not show a major change. Minimum change was observed
in the tensile strength from 320 N to 302 N, though Barcol hardness
remained unchanged at 78, in the specified time period of exposure.

2.7 Chlorination and Oxidation
Chlorine dissolves at 3 g/L water
at 70 °C, and reaction of chlorine with water is well studied
producing HCl and HOCl. A highly reactive compound, HOCl is not only
known for oxidation but also chlorination.32 Chloronium (Cl+) ion is the active chlorinating species
at pH < 1, as proposed by Swain et al.,58 probably the reason for chlorination in the present case. A review
by Deborde and Gunten reveals the chlorination and oxidation of various
organic compounds in chlorine water.32 Mikdam
et al. described the detailed kinetics of HOCl reactivity and oxidative
degradation of the PP polymer.59 The nature
of effect as seen through the loss
of mechanical strength of the polymer sheet as well as the cloth samples,
diffusion of chlorine and water is the likely phenomenon to initiate
chemical reaction with polymer chain. HOCl content at low pH is less;
nevertheless, it possesses a high oxidation potential in the presence
of molecular chlorine.60

Based on
the literature information and the results obtained above, a mechanism
described below can provide more insight into the chlorination and
oxidation (Scheme 1). The availability of proton (C–H) is the key factor in the
chemical attack in the present case. This could be true and explains
the fact that Teflon (poly(tetrafluoroethylene)) is inert in the present
system. Both oxidation and chlorination reactions can happen at the
C–H center under different modes of reaction, with HOCl passing
through a cyclic intermediate. The preference of reactivity of HOCl
to the proton may be governed by the electronic or steric configuration
of the attached carbon. Interestingly, the reactivity of ETFE is restricted
to oxidation. This may be due to the fact that fluorine is a highly
electronegative group that does not allow bonding electron to be given
away, as described in (a). In ECTFE, due to the presence of chlorine,
steric reason dominates, making the polymer inactive to chemical reaction.

Oxidation (b)
3 Conclusions
Aqueous HCl containing chlorine gas system at temperature >50
°C is a very important and unique corrosion system for the corrosion-resistant
materials. The said corrosion media are one of the very common systems
used in various chlorination processes in the industries. Materials
like PP, PET, ECTFE, ETFE, and VER (Derakane 470-300) used in the
corrosion media even show some changes in the present system, which
possesses acidic, chlorination, and oxidation environment to initiate
the corrosion reaction. PP and PET are affected by both chlorination
and oxidation, whereas ETFE could resist chlorination but failed to
resist oxidation attack. ECTFE did not show any chemical change except
the morphological change noticed in the XRD and SEM image, without
any drop in mechanical strength. Some change was observed in VER (Derakane),
but it could maintain the strength intact. FTIR, XRD, EDX, DMA, and
SEM are very supportive analytical tools to evaluate the corrosion
stability of the specimen investigated. The aforementioned studies
recommend that ECTFE as a coating material and VER as a construction
material for chemical process can be used in the corrosion media of
aqueous hydrochloric acid containing chlorine gas at temperature 70
°C.
The availability of methylenic proton (>CH2) is predicted
to be more reactive to HOCl, whereas >C(Cl)H is observed to be
inactive to HOCl mostly due to steric reason. Nevertheless, electron-withdrawing
substituents in >CH2 may prevent chlorination.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
The polymer samples were obtained through original manufacturing
process. The cloth sample was 40 μm in diameter × 6 in.
× 6 in., whereas the sheet sample was of size 200 mm × 300
mm × 3 mm. Chlorine was obtained from GACL, India, and HCl was
purchased from SD fine chemicals, India. VER was obtained having glass
fiber
as base material.

XRD was checked in Bruker Model D8 ADVANCE.
Cu Kα beam radiation and data were analyzed through Defrac.Suite
EVA software. FTIR was checked in Nicolet 6000 using ATR mode form
650 to 4000 cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry
was done by TA Instruments, Model TGAQ500 and DSCQ2000, under air
at 10 °C/min, respectively. DMA was done by Perkin Elmer Model
PE8000 under air in the single-cantilever mode. SEM and energy dispersive
X-ray analysis were recorded by FEI Ltd Model Nova NanoSEM 450. Puncture
test (ASTM D4833), tensile strength (ASTM D638), and Barcol hardness
(ASTM D2583) were tested by the laboratory instruments of Central
Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology, Ahmedabad, India.

4.2 Procedure
A jacketed glass vessel of 5 L equipped with a top lid, a chlorine
gas inlet, and an outlet system was filled with 2 L of 6 wt % hydrochloric
acid aqueous solution. Hot water circulation was passed through the
jacket of the vessel (Figure 20). Chlorine gas was continuously purged through the inlet
of the vessel and the outlet was connected to a scrubber filled with
20% caustic so that no chlorine is detected at the scrubber outlet.
The solution was continuously stirred for homogeneous mixing. The
system with desired corrosion media was ready for testing the specimen.
The top lid was kept tightly closed during purging of chlorine gas.

The top lid was opened and the coupon specimens were inserted into
the solution and tightly closed. The coupons were partially submerged
into the solution, so that 1/4th remained in air. The process was
run for nonstop 1440 h (60 days) to observe reasonable change in the
coupons. There was need of three such vessels to accommodate all the
testing coupons. After the desired time period, the chlorine supply
was stopped and the coupons were taken out carefully without touching
the surface, washed with water, and dried under air circulating oven
at 70 °C for 3 h. Drying of the coupons was monitored through
constant weight measurement. Completion of drying was noticed by no
drop in weight. Afterward, the sample specimens were taken for testing.
