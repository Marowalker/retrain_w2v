trans-Cinnamic acid was synthesized under microwave
irradiation, and it was used for the removal of copper, a toxic metal
found in industrial wastewater, from synthetic polluted aqueous solutions.
Copper removal is more favorable at pH 5 and was enhanced by increasing
the copper initial concentration, reaching a maximum uptake capacity
of 389.5 mg/g, which is higher than those reported in the literature.
Temperature exhibited a negligible effect on the removal of copper
by trans-cinnamic acid. The isotherm equilibrium
uptake data were found to be described by the Langmuir model. In addition,
the study of the removal kinetics shows that the uptake of copper
by trans-cinnamic acid follows pseudo-first order
kinetics, and equilibrium is attained at approximately 30 min. Based
on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning
transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
studies, a copper–cinnamic acid complex [Cu(CA)2] is formed during the removal process. The reusability of this coordination
compound was investigated using HCl, HNO3, and NaOH 0.1
M as desorption eluents; HCl was capable of completely desorbing copper
from [Cu(CA)2], and trans-cinnamic acid
was recovered as the trans-isomer. Alternatively,
the [Cu(CA)2] was used to remove octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
from gaseous streams for biogas purification, obtaining an adsorption
capacity of 3.37 mg/g. These promising results demonstrate the feasibility
of copper removal by trans-cinnamic acid because
of its high uptake capacity and potential reusability.

Introduction
Nowadays, removal of heavy metals from wastewater is a significant
environmental concern. Heavy metals have been discharged into water
bodies because of the rapid growth of industries such as metal-plating
facilities, mining operations, fertilizers, batteries, tanneries,
pulp and paper mills, and pesticide manufacturers. Not only are heavy
metals non-degradable and toxic even at very low concentrations but
they will also form complexes with natural organic matter and will
be bio-accumulated in animals, plants, and the human body, causing
serious diseases and disorders.1 According
to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), copper
is one of the most widespread heavy metals in the environment.2 Therefore, the treatment of heavy metal containing
wastewater is required prior to its discharge. The methods that have
been commonly used to remove toxic metals from wastewater are coagulation/precipitation,3,4 ion exchange,5 liquid–liquid extraction,6 cementation,7 electrodialysis,8 adsorption,9 and membrane
separation.10 To select a specific treatment
method, several parameters should be considered, such as the operation
cost, environmental impact, initial concentration of the copper ions,
and pH values, among others.

Recently, researchers have been interested in new materials that
are easily synthesized, exhibit selectivity for heavy metals, and
that can be used in a wide range of physicochemical conditions. trans-Cinnamic acid (3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid) derivatives
compose a relatively large family of organic acids isomers conventionally
synthesized by the Perkin reaction and the Knoevenagel condensation,11,12 or by the environmentally friendly methods using ultrasound and
microwave irradiation through the Knoevenagel condensation.13−17 Besides, the trans-cinnamic acid possesses antibacterial,
antifungal, and parasite fighting abilities,18 and it is used in the production of flavors, dyes, and pharmaceuticals,
as well as in the production of its methyl, ethyl, and benzyl esters,
which are perfume components. Additionally, trans-cinnamic acid is a precursor to the sweetener aspartame.19 In wine, trans-cinnamic acid
and its derivatives join benzoic acid derivatives and flavonoids in
creating pigments and tannin agents that give each harvest its characteristic
bouquet and color.20 Several compounds
of trans-cinnamic acid with copper have been prepared
in aqueous solution,21,22 thus, this material has demonstrated
affinity for heavy metals.

In addition to the affinity for the solute of interest, it is desirable
that the material be easily regenerated and/or reused. Chemical regeneration
is usually recommended because it allows the possibility to recover
valuable solutes that can be reused in adsorption/desorption cycles.
On the other hand, spent materials can be recycled as raw materials
for ceramic,23 catalyst24 and fertilizer25 production,
or as an adsorbent for purification processes. For instance, adsorbent
materials have been used for the purification of biogas to remove
siloxane compounds that causes deposits on the combustion surfaces
or gas processing equipment.26

In the present work, trans-cinnamic acid was synthesized
under microwave irradiation and it was used as a new material that
exhibits a remarkable uptake capacity of copper from aqueous solution. trans-Cinnamic acid was characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR).
The effect of pH, initial concentrations, and temperature on the uptake
capacity was studied in batch experiments. Furthermore, the uptake
equilibrium and kinetics were also comprehensively investigated, as
well as the reusability of the spent material for the removal of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
(D4) in gaseous streams. Finally, the uptake and desorption mechanisms
were explored using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), XRD, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), 1H NMR, and FTIR studies.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of trans-Cinnamic Acid
For
the synthesis of trans-cinnamic acid, malonic acid,
and benzaldehyde were reacted with piperidine and triethylamine as
the base and toluene as the solvent, under microwave irradiations
to 100 °C for 1 h, yielding the target compound with a 68% yield
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of trans-Cinnamic Acid
The trans-cinnamic acid (CA) was obtained as a
white solid, with a melting point 130–131 °C and the product
was characterized by NMR (1H and 13C). In the 1H NMR spectra, we can observe two doublet signals at 6.53
and 7.59 ppm which are attributed for protons in the double bond,
with J = 16.0 Hz which demonstrate the geometry trans.
Besides, it is possible to observe two multiple signals at 7.30–7.43
ppm, for three H-aromatics, and at 6.67–7.69 ppm, for two H-aromatics.
Finally, at 12.42 ppm we can observe a broad signal which is attributed
for −OH from the carboxylic acid group. For the 13C NMR we can observe seven signals, 119.2, 128.2, 128.9, 130.2, 134.2,
143.9, and 167.6 ppm, four aromatic carbons, two vinylic carbons,
and one carbon for the carbonyl group (C=O). These data are
in agreement with the literature.27

Once the trans-cinnamic acid was synthesized,
the next step was to evaluate the effect of pH, temperature, and initial
copper concentration on the uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic acid.

Effect of pH on the Uptake Capacity of Copper
The acidity
or basicity of aqueous solution determines the chemical speciation
of the solute which could affect the removal process. Therefore, the
effect of pH on the uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic
acid was evaluated. As can be seen in Figure 1, low uptake capacities were obtained at
pH 2, 3, and 4 (lower than 2 mg/g); meanwhile, a further augmentation
of the pH at 5 causes an increase on the uptake capacity to 60 mg/g.

Figure 1 Effect of pH on copper uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic acid. Conditions: 25 °C, 1 g/L, 400 min–1, and 1 mM copper initial concentration.

Furthermore, an additional experiment was carried out at initial
pH 5 without pH control. From Figure 2, it is evident the influence of pH on the uptake capacity
of trans-cinnamic acid, when the pH decreases from
5 to 3.45 the uptake capacity decreases as well from 60 to 0.43 mg/g.

Figure 2 Copper removal kinetics of trans-cinnamic acid
without pH control. Conditions: 25 °C, 1 g/L, 400 min–1, 1 mM copper initial concentration, and initial pH of 5.

At pH lower than 5.5, Cu2+ is the only chemical species
on the aqueous solution.28 On the other
hand, trans-cinnamic acid has a pKa of 4.429 and therefore it
is deprotonated by 0, 3, 23, and 85% at pH 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
Thus, as the pH increases, the fraction of deprotonated trans-cinnamic acid increases too, causing an increase on the affinity
for the copper ions (Cu2+). A further pH augmentation of
aqueous solution could lead to copper precipitation. In addition,
the zeta potential of CA was determined to investigate the surface
potential in aqueous solutions with pH values between 3 and 6 (Figure 3). Herein, it is
observed that Z-potential varies from 1.4 to −9.38
mV as pH approaches to 6. It is also noticed that the isoelectric
point is about at pH = 3.3, which means that above this point the
CA surface is negatively charged. This result is congruent with that
observed from removal experiments, where the highest uptake capacity
was obtained at pH 5 corresponding to a higher negative surface charge
compared to the experiments carried out at pH 2, 3, and 4, indicating
that the ability of CA to remove Cu2+ depends on its deprotonation.

Figure 3 Zeta potential of CA at different pH values.

Effect of Temperature and Initial Concentration on Uptake Capacity
The effect of the temperature on the uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic acid was evaluated from 25 to 60 °C
(Figure 4). The results
showed that the uptake capacity was not affected by the temperature.

Figure 4 Effect of temperature on copper uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic acid. Conditions: 400 min–1, 1 g/L, and
1 mM copper initial concentration.

Additionally, the effect of the initial copper concentration on
the uptake capacity was evaluated from 0.1 to 11 mmol/L. As shown
in Figure 5, the uptake
capacity increases with the augmentation of the initial copper concentration.
The increase of the initial copper concentration leads to a higher
driving force for the copper removal as well as a major occupancy
of the active sites. On the other hand, an analysis of the total organic
compounds before and after copper removal was carried out to determine
the amount of CA that remains in the solution after copper removal.
The results indicated an increase of the total organic content from
1.41 to 90.76 mg/L. These results are an indication that less than
9% of the trans-cinnamic acid remain in the solution
after the copper uptake.

Figure 5 Effect of initial copper concentration on uptake capacity of trans-cinnamic acid. Conditions: 25 °C, 400 min–1, and 1 g/L.

Equilibrium Uptake Capacity
The relationship of uptake
capacity of trans-cinnamic acid and copper concentration
at equilibrium is depicted in Figure 6. As the equilibrium concentration rises, the equilibrium
uptake capacity also increases until a plateau is reached. The isotherm
form is convex which refers to a favorable removal. Langmuir and Freundlich
models were used to fit the equilibrium data, where the Langmuir isotherm
model fitted the experimental data better than the Freundlich isotherm
model according to the higher value of the determination coefficient R2 (Table 1). For comparison purposes, maximum uptake capacity (qm) of copper onto trans-cinnamic
acid is shown along with the maximum uptake capacity of various adsorbents
reported in the literature, showing that cinnamic acid has a better
removal capacity (389.5 mg/g) than other adsorbents previously reported
in the literature (Table 2).

Removal Kinetics of Copper Ions by trans-Cinnamic
Acid
Removal kinetics provides valuable information about
the performance of a material in the process and offers insights about
the possible uptake mechanisms. For instance, the residence time,
which is determined by the solute uptake rate, is relevant for pilot-scale
applications.46 Thus, the evolution of
the uptake capacity through time was determined and it is shown in Figure 7, where it can be
noticed that the equilibrium is reached after 30 min of contact time.
Two common kinetic models, pseudo-first order (PS-1), and pseudo-second
order (PS-2) kinetic models, were used to predict the removal kinetics
of copper onto trans-cinnamic acid. The PS-1 kinetic
model showed a higher determination coefficient for fitting the experimental
data (Table 3) compared
to determination coefficient of the PS-2 model. Additionally, the
value of the removal capacity at equilibrium predicted by the PS-1
was similar to the experimental data; meanwhile, the value predicted
by the PS-2 was 45% higher than the experimental value. Some satisfactory
fits of removal kinetics data with the PS-1 model have been reported
elsewhere.28,47,48

Uptake Mechanism of Copper
The XRD patterns of trans-cinnamic acid and [Cu(CA)2] are presented
in Figure 8. The pattern
of synthesized trans-cinnamic acid can be related
to the presence of the (alpha) polymorph of ortho-ethoxy-trans-cinnamic acid49 because of the highest peak in 26° and a smaller peak that
appeared in 21°. It is noticeable that after the removal process,
any crystallographic evidence of the trans-cinnamic
acid in the [Cu(CA)2] pattern cannot be seen, suggesting
the formation of a completely different structure.

Figure 8 XRD pattern of (a) trans-cinnamic acid and (b)
[Cu(CA)2].

In addition, the thermal stability of trans-cinnamic
acid before and after copper removal was evaluated by TGA. trans-Cinnamic acid is thermally stable at temperatures
lower than 105 °C, and then a progressive weight loss is observed
up to 177 °C where trans-cinnamic acid loses
97% of its initial weight. After copper removal, an increase of the
thermal stability of [Cu(CA)2] was observed because only
a weight loss of 20% was registered at 300 °C.

FTIR was used to identify differences between trans-cinnamic acid before and after the removal process. The spectra
obtained are shown in Figure 9, where the disappearance of the stretch −OH is found
at 2645–2627 cm–1. Also, the other bands
shifted to lower wavenumbers in the spectrum of trans-cinnamic acid after the copper removal [Cu(CA)2] (Table 4). The influence of
copper as an electron-rich atom causes an increase in the density
charge around the double bond in the carboxylate, so in the black
spectra, the bands −C=C– are intensified. Approximately
between 1300 and 1230 cm–1, another case of vibration
−C=C– of the aromatic group is observed, this
time, the bands are at similar wavenumbers, however, the intensity
decreased. This decrease is considered as evidence of the increase
in the perturbation of the aromatic system in the ring, which is caused
by the effect of the double bond in the carboxylate.

removal and (b) after removal.

In order to get further insight regarding Cu removal by the functional
groups of trans-cinnamic acid, we proceed to measure
C 1s, O 1s, and Cu 2p XPS spectra from trans-cinnamic
acid, as well as [Cu(CA)2]. Figure 10 shows C 1s and O 1s spectra recorded from trans-cinnamic acid, where three peaks can be recognized
at 284.6, 285.7, and 288.9 eV, attributed to C in C–C, C–O,
and O–C=O, respectively (Figure 10a); along with two peaks at 532.5 and 533.6
eV, related to O in C–O and O–C=O, respectively
(Figure 10b).

Figure 10 (a) C 1s and (b) O 1s spectra recorded by XPS from trans-cinnamic acid.

Figure 11 displays
C 1s, O 1s, and Cu 2p spectra recorded from [Cu(CA)2].
Likewise, the C 1s spectrum shows peaks related to C–C, C–O,
and O–C=O, although they depict a change in their binding
energies, which is more obvious for the emission associated with O–C=O
(ΔBE = 1 eV) (Figure 11a). Moreover, the O 1s spectrum shows a remarkable shift in
the binding energy related to photo-emission from O–C=O
(ΔBE = 0.9 eV) (Figure 11b). It is also observed that the Cu 2p spectrum, where it
is possible to identify two prominent peaks at 954.4 and 934.3 eV,
corresponds to photo-electrons emitted from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core levels, respectively; those related to their satellite
at 962.8 and 943.7 eV correspond to shake-up-like of Cu2+ at higher binding energies than the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 edge, respectively (Figure 11c)50,51 Accordingly, shifts
in the binding energy associated to C and O at O–C=O
and the presence of shake up satellites at Cu 2p spectra confirms
the efficient removal of Cu2+ cations at carboxylic moieties
of trans-cinnamic acid molecules.52,53

Figure 11 (a) C 1s, (b) O 1s, and (c) Cu 2p spectra recorded by XPS from
the [Cu(CA)2].

Moreover, there is a remarkable change in the morphological features
of CA particles before and after copper removal (Figure 12). This change involves a
turn from an acicular-like morphology to the formation of square plates
of CA.

Figure 12 HAADF–STEM images obtained from CA (a) before and (b) after
the removal of copper.

Based on these results, an uptake mechanism for the formation of
the coordination compound [Cu(CA)2] is proposed. This is
carried out, from 2 mol of trans-cinnamic acid with
NaOH to form the corresponding carboxylate and the subsequent nucleophilic
substitution with copper nitrate hemi(pentahydrate) by double substitution
of the oxygen atom with the negative charge, and then with the interaction
of one of the pairs of free electrons of the second oxygen toward
the metal to generate the copper complex [Cu(CA)2] (Scheme 2). This structure
is in agreement with the one proposed by Drew et al.54 and Kumar et al.,55 where dimeric
copper complexes using cinnamate were prepared. On the other hand,
physisorption analysis was carried out to estimate the surface area
of [Cu(CA)2], where a value of 18.06 m2/g was
obtained with a significant fraction of the pore volume corresponding
to mesopores (89.5%).

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of the Coordination Compound
[Cu(CA)2]
Desorption and Reusability
Spent materials after removal
processes are usually subjected to regeneration to keep the process
economic. In this sense, several eluents have been employed to regenerate
spent materials, such as acid and basic solutions.56 The desorption of copper ions from [Cu(CA)2]
was evaluated using HCl, HNO3, and NaOH 0.1 M as eluents. Figure 13 shows that the
copper concentration desorbed from [Cu(CA)2] and the desorption
percentage. Copper desorption was found to follow the order HCl >
HNO3 > NaOH. The best results were presented under acidic
desorption conditions because when using NaOH there was practically
no desorption process, on the other hand when comparing the two acids
it is observed that the greater the pKa, the better the release of the metal ion, this can be explained
because of the strong acidic nature that HCl has with a pKa of −8.0 compared to HNO3 that has
a pKa of −1.3.

Figure 13 Copper desorption from [Cu(CA)2] by different eluents.
Conditions: 25 °C, 400 min–1 stirring speed,
1 g/L. Solid line represents the desorption percentage.

With respect to the desorption mechanism, the protonation of one
of the oxygen atoms of the [Cu(CA)2] is first carried out
and subsequently the nucleophilic attack by the chloride anion of
HCl on the copper atom, promoting the rupture of the covalent bond,
and recovering the electron pair of the originally protonated oxygen
atom. This new species formed, presents an equilibrium with the carboxylic
acid of trans-cinnamic acid and with the species
of partial coordination with copper metal, finally this same process
occurs to generate a second molecule of trans-cinnamic
acid in addition to copper chloride (CuCl2) as final products
of the process (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism of Copper Desorption from [Cu(CA)2]
Using Chloride Acid
The solid obtained after the desorption process by 1H NMR was analyzed, and it showed four signal groups, the first one
appeared at 6.5 ppm like a doublet with J = 16.0
Hz, the second one appeared in the region from 7.3 to 7.4 ppm, which
was assigned for three aromatic hydrogens, at 7.6 ppm was possible
to observe another doublet with J = 16.0 Hz, and
finally multiple signals were observed from 7.65 to 7.70 ppm, which
were assigned for two aromatic hydrogens. The J =
16.0 Hz value indicates that the trans-cinnamic acid
was recovered like the trans-isomer. Further, the
analysis by high-resolution mass spectroscopy showed an (M + H) m/z 149.05891 value, which is in agreement
with the calculated exact mass for the trans-cinnamic
acid (M + H) m/z 149.06025.

Finally, the reusability of [Cu(CA)2] in the removal
of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) from gaseous streams was evaluated.
D4 is a common siloxane in biogas streams which causes severe damages
to the engine parts of combustion motors when the biogas is used as
the biofuel. Accordingly, preliminary adsorption tests were carried
out using [Cu(CA)2], where an adsorption capacity of 3.37
mg/g was obtained when the initial concentration of D4 was 400 mg/Nm3. This result herald a potential application for [Cu(CA)2] in biogas purification. In fact, experiments for the simultaneous
removal of several siloxanes using [Cu(CA)2] are in progress.

Conclusions
In this work, the properties of trans-cinnamic
acid for the removal of copper from aqueous solution have been studied
for the first time. The removal process was examined under different
conditions including pH, contact time, initial copper concentrations,
and temperature, and the maximum uptake capacity obtained was 389.5
mg/g at pH 5, 25 °C, and 400 min–1. The kinetic
data of the copper removal were adequately predicted with the pseudo-first-order
kinetic model, and the equilibrium state was obtained after 30 min.
Moreover, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were employed to represent
the equilibrium isotherm, and the Langmuir model fitted the experimental
data with better determination coefficient. Characterization of [Cu(CA)2] revealed that a mesoporous coordination compound is formed
as a result of the removal of copper by trans-cinnamic
acid. Experiments show that copper can be completely desorbed from
[Cu(CA)2] using HCl as the eluent, and the CA was recovered
as its trans-isomer. Additionally, [Cu(CA)2] might be used to adsorb D4 because an adsorption capacity of 3.37
mg/g was achieved in preliminary experiments at 400 mg/Nm3 D4 initial concentration. These results suggest that trans-cinnamic acid synthesized under microwave irradiation could be a
promising material for the removal of copper from wastewater.

Experimental Section
Procedure for the Synthesis of trans-Cinnamic
Acid
All commercial materials were used as received unless
otherwise noted. In a round bottom flask with a reflux condenser,
malonic acid (1 equiv), triethylamine (1 equiv), benzaldehyde (1 equiv),
piperidine (0.2 equiv), and toluene (20 mL) were mixed. The flask
was positioned in the irradiation cavity and the mixture was heated
with stirring under microwave irradiation at 110 °C and held
for 60 min. Then, the flask was cooled to room temperature and the
residue was dissolved in methanol and then concentrated under reduced
pressure. The crude was cooled at room temperature and 10 mL of 5%
sodium bicarbonate was added slowly, next it was stirred for 20 min.
The mixture was washed with ethyl acetate and aqueous layer was collected,
cooled at 0 °C, and then the pH was adjusted with HCl until pH
4. The solid was filtered and washed with ether and hexanes. (68%)
It was obtained as a white solid, mp 130–131 °C; 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
6.53 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 1H), 7.30–7.43 (m, 3H),
7.59 (d, J = 16.0 Hz, 1H), 7.67–7.69 (m, 2H), 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
119.2, 128.2, 128.9, 130.2, 134.2, 143.9, 167.6 (C=O).27

Characterization
In order to characterize the structure
of the material, the XRD patterns were collected using a Siemens D5000
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å)
operated at 35 kV and 25 mA in the 2θ range of 2–50°
at 0.02°/min with a step time of 4 s. FTIR was employed to allow
the identification of chemical functional groups onto the materials
surface where a PerkinElmer instrument (spectrum one model) from 500
to 4000 cm–1 was used.

Melting point was registered
using an Electrothermal Mel-Temp apparatus. Thin-layer chromatography
was performed on pre-coated sheets of silica gel 60 F254 (E. Merck).
The spectra were obtained in the DMSO-d6 solution. 1H NMR data were acquired on an Inova 300 MHz
and on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in parts per million and coupling constants were expressed
as (J) and reported in Hertz (Hz). 13C
NMR data were acquired on a Bruker NMR spectrometer at 100 MHz. Mass
spectral data were obtained using ESI techniques (Agilent, 6210 TOF).
Reactions carried out with stirring under microwave irradiation in
open-vessels were all performed with a CEM Discover.

XPS was performed at room temperature for measuring C 1s, O 1s,
and Cu 2p spectra from the sample of trans-cinnamic
acid loaded with Cu2+ ions [Cu(CA)2], as well
as pure trans-cinnamic acid in a Thermo-Scientific,
K-Alpha spectrometer with monochromatized Al Kα radiation (E = 1.5 keV), X-ray spot of 400 μm and flood gun for
charge compensation. Peaks of the recorded XPS spectra were deconvoluted
and fitted using a Gaussian approach and nonlinear baseline. The specific
surface area was obtained using the N2 physisorption analysis
at 77 K (BEL Beslorp II) and the BET method, the pore volume was estimated
by the BJH method. The morphology of CA particles was observed before
and after Cu removal experiments using STEM using high-angular annular
dark field (HAADF–STEM) imaging technique in a Field Emission
Gun, FEI TITAN G2 80–300, microscope, operated at 300 kV. The Z-potential measurement was performed in a Malvern, ZetaSizer,
Nano-ZS90 apparatus, using citric acid, sodium citrate, and phosphate-buffered
saline aqueous media in order to control the pH of CA in an interval
between 3 and 6. The content of CA which was dissolved into aqueous
solution during the removal experiments was determined by means of
the total organic carbon content using a Shimadzu VCSN analyzer.

Copper Uptake Experiments
Copper uptake experiments
were conducted in 1 L flasks at room temperature, 1 g of CA per liter
of solution, 400 min–1 stirring speed, and pH controlled
by adding 0.1 M HNO3 or 0.1 M NaOH as needed. When the
temperature effect on the uptake capacity was evaluated, the temperature
was kept constant at 25, 40, and 60 °C by using a bath temperature.
In the pH effect studies, the temperature was kept constant at 25
°C, and the pH was varied from 2 to 5 and kept constant through
the entire experiment adding acid or base aliquots. Additionally,
an experiment without pH control was performed to evaluate the effect
on the uptake capacity. Furthermore, the isotherm was obtained at
pH 5, 25 °C and initial copper concentration between 0.1 and
11 mmol/L. Several aliquots were taken from the solution until equilibrium
was reached for further concentration analysis by atomic absorption
spectroscopy (Cintra GBC 942 AA) by direct aspiration into an air-acetylene
flame at a flowrate of 0.4 mL/min using a wavelength of 327.5 nm.
The uptake capacity was obtained by a mass balance as follows 1  where q is the uptake capacity
at the time t (mg/g), Co is the initial copper concentration (mg/L), C is
the copper concentration at the time t (mg/L), V is the volume of the metal solution (L), and m is the mass of the CA (mg).

Desorption Experiments
Desorption experiments were
carried out using HCl, HNO3, and NaOH 0.1 M as eluents.
First, the removal of copper by trans-cinnamic acid
was conducted in 1 L flasks at room temperature, 1 g of CA per liter
of the solution, 400 min–1 stirring speed, and pH
5. After the equilibrium was reached (40 min), the spent CA [Cu(CA)2] was separated from the copper solution by filtration. Then,
100 mg of [Cu(CA)2] was placed in 250 mL flask containing
100 mL of HCl, HNO3, or NaOH 0.1 M and allowed to equilibrate
for 24 h in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. After, aliquots were taken
for further copper concentration analysis by means of atomic absorption
spectrometry.

Reusability Experiments
The [Cu(CA)2] was
subjected to an adsorption test for the removal of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
(D4) from gaseous streams. The adsorption experiment was carried out
using a mass/volume ratio of 1 g/L, D4 initial concentration of 400
mg/Nm3, 25 °C, 1 atm. First, a volume of D4 (analytical
grade, 98% of purity, provided by Sigma-Aldrich) was volatilized into
a 1.48 L glass flask to obtain a D4 gaseous solution. Then, the mixture
was diluted to obtain a concentration of 400 mg/Nm3. This
solution was put into contact with 100 mg of [Cu(CA)2]
during 24 h until the equilibrium was reached. Several aliquots were
taken and analyzed by a Nexis GC 2030 gas chromatograph with a flame
ionization detector to monitor the siloxane concentration. The column
used was an SH-Rxi-5ms SHIMADZU (15.0 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter
× 0.25 μm film thickness). The temperature of the injector
port, oven, and detector were set at 150, 110, and 250 °C, respectively.
Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.50
mL/min and pressure of 12.08 psi. Gas samples of 500 μL were
injected to the GC. The duration of the method was 1.4 min. Finally,
the uptake capacity was obtained by mass balance following eq 1.

Isotherm Models
The equilibrium data were fitted by
using the well-known Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Equation 2 refers to the Langmuir
isotherm model where qm and b are the Langmuir parameters, maximum uptake capacity (mg/g) and
equilibrium constant (L/mg), respectively. 2  

The Freundlich parameters, KF and n, are related to uptake
capacity (mg1–1/n g–1 L1/n) and intensity (dimensionless),
respectively. 3  

The parameters were obtained from nonlinear regression using the
generalized reduced gradient (GRG2) algorithm, where the coefficient
of determination, R2, were maximized.

Uptake Kinetics Models
The uptake kinetics data were
analyzed by using the pseudo-first order (PS-1) kinetic model and
the pseudo-second order (PS-2) kinetic model. The most popular form
used for the PS-1 rate equation is 4  where q and qe are the amounts of copper uptake per gram of trans-cinnamic acid (mg/g) at time t (min)
and at equilibrium, respectively, and k1 (min–1) is the rate constant of the PS-1 model.

The PS-2 kinetic rate equation is57 5  where k2 (g/mg
min) is the rate constant of the PS-2 model.

The PS-1 and PS-2 parameters were obtained from nonlinear regression
the generalized reduced gradient (GRG2) algorithm by maximizing the
coefficient of determination R2 similarly
to equilibrium data.
