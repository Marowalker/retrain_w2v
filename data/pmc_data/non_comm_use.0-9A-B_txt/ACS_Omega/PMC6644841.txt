Solar
light-activated photocatalyst nanoparticles (NPs) are promising
environment-friendly low cost tools for water decontamination, but
their dispersion in the environment must be minimized. Here, we propose
the incorporation of TiO2-NPs (also in combination with
graphene platelets) into highly biocompatible hydrogels as a promising
approach for the production of photoactive materials for water treatment.
We also propose a convenient fluorescence-based method to investigate
the hydrogel photocatalytic activity in real time with a conventional
fluorimeter. Kinetics analysis of the degradation profile of a target
fluorescent model pollutant demonstrates that fast degradation occurs
in the matrix bulk. Fluorescence anisotropy proved that small pollutant
molecules diffuse freely in the hydrogel. Rheological and scanning
electron microscopy characterization showed that the TiO2-NP incorporation does not significantly alter the hydrogel mechanical
and morphological properties.

Introduction
Pollution is one of
the most important unsolved problems that nowadays
affects our society. Photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants
is a very attractive strategy to convert contaminants into harmless
compounds by using eco-friendly materials.1 This approach is typically based on nanostructured photocatalysts,
which are activated by solar light and use the absorbed energy to
produce reactive chemical species, starting from water and oxygen
(as schematized in Figure 1),2 and are able to degrade organic
pollutants.3,4 Most effective photocatalysts are metal-oxide
semiconductors (such as ZnO, FeO3, and WO35) and, in particular, titanium dioxide nanoparticles
(TiO2-NPs), in their anatase form, which have been widely
used for a range of applications, including self-cleaning,5 surface sterilization,6 and air7 and water8 purification. Advantageous features of TiO2-NPs
are the excellent stability in water, large-scale availability, and
low cost. TiO2-NPs also show low toxicity,9,10 nevertheless the recent concerns about the still partially unpredictable
risks related to the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and
human health, as a defensive approach to minimize their dispersion
in the environment.11,12

Figure 1 Reactive oxygen species generated in the
photocatalytic reduction
and oxidation steps of oxygen and water. Absorption of light (1) causes
the transition of electrons to the conduction band and the formation
of holes in the valence band. Part of the produced charges undergo
recombination (2), whereas others migrate to the surface where trapped
electrons (3) participate in the reductive steps (blue arrows) and
trapped holes (4) in the oxidative processes.

Incorporation of TiO2-NPs in highly biocompatible,
macroscopic
matrixes that preserve the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor
NPs is hence a fundamental challenge in the design of new materials
for photocatalysis. As a fundamental feature, these matrixes should
present (i) a high water content because water plays an essential
role in the photocatalytic process (see Figure 1), (ii) good permeability to small molecules
(pollutants), and (iii) good transparency to solar light.

In
the last few years, we focused our research on the use of small
pseudopeptides to form supramolecular hydrogels13−16 with specific properties, tailored
to suit the applications of the produced hydrogels.17−21 Hence, we could obtain hydrogels of different strengths,
pH values, and transparencies. These properties are not all necessarily
needed for a given application. In this paper, we want to describe
the preparation of transparent hydrogels and their application for
photodegradation.22,23

We recently reported the
preparation of hydrogels by slow pH variation
of a water solution of Fmoc-L-Tyr-D-Oxd-OH [Fmoc = fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl;
Tyr = tyrosine; and D-Oxd = (4R,5S)-4-carboxy-5-methyl-oxazolidin-2-one] (F in Figure 2),24 and we compared their properties with the hydrogels formed
with other gelators, among them Fmoc-Phe-Phe.25−28 We could demonstrate that the
hydrogels prepared with gelator F, with pH variation
as a trigger, reach a high transparency.24 Here, we describe the preparation of hydrogels, based on F, containing either TiO2-NPs or TiO2-NPs in
combination with graphene platelets, and we demonstrate the ability
to photodegrade a model pollutant compound (rhodamine B; RhB) upon ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. TiO2-NPs, in fact,
absorb the UV part of the solar spectrum (λ < 380 nm)29 being the band gap between the conduction band
(CB) and the valence band (VB),10 ΔE ≈ 3.25 eV (Figure 1). Integration of graphene in the photocatalytic TiO2 platform was also investigated to check the effect of graphene
platelets on the hydrogel properties because carbon nanomaterials,30 such as nanotubes,31 carbon dots,32 graphene oxide,33 and reduced graphene oxide,34,35 have been reported to increase the photocatalytic performances of
TiO2-NPs.

Figure 2 Chemical structure of gelator F and rhodamine RhB.

We would like to stress
that different from other systems where
TiO2-NPs36,37 can be activated by sunlight
only on the surface of the exposed material (e.g., TiO2 photocatalyst embedded in cementitious materials5,38−40), in our photocatalytic hydrogels, light penetrates
inside the matrix.

To demonstrate this outcome, we developed
a new real-time fluorescence-based
method for investigating the photocatalytic activity inside the hydrogels.
One original feature of this approach is that the photocatalyst irradiation
and the target degradation detection can be performed simultaneously
in a standard fluorimeter, as shown in Figure 2.

Results and Discussion
Hydrogel Preparation and
Characterization
For the hydrogel
preparation, we used the pH change method. This method relies upon
the enhanced solubility of Fmoc-Tyr-Oxd-OH at basic pH, followed by
a slow decrease of pH by the addition of glucono-δ-lactone.41 We prepared three different samples of hydrogels:
(i) hydrogel 1 (H) contains only the gelator Fmoc-l-Tyr-d-Oxd-OH in 0.5% (w/w) concentration and glucono-δ-lactone;
(ii) hydrogel 2 (H-T) contains the gelator in 0.5% concentration,
TiO2-NPs (0.2 mg/mL), and glucono-δ-lactone; (iii) 3 (H-TG) is prepared following the same procedure used for 2 (H-T), but replacing TiO2-NPs with TiO2-NPs/graphene.42

Before testing
the hydrogels based on Fmoc-L-Tyr-D-Oxd-OH for the photocatalytic
applications, we investigated the effect of TiO2-NPs or
TiO2-NPs/graphene on their mechanical and morphological
characteristics. Rheological analyses have been performed to evaluate
the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels 1 (H), 2 (H-T), and 3 (H-TG) in terms of storage and
loss moduli (G′ and G″,
respectively) (Table 1and Figures S1 and S2).

Table 1 Storage Moduli (G′) and Loss Moduli (G″) of Hydrogels 1 (H), 2 (H-T), and 3 (H-TG)
hydrogel	G′ (Pa)	G″ (Pa)	
1 (H)	1370	90	
2(H-T)	1055	63	
3(H-TG)	556	46	
Although
the hydrogels are characterized by a “solidlike”
behavior, that is, the storage modulus is approximately an order of
magnitude higher than the loss component, these hydrogels do not show
very high G′ values because of the very low
concentration of the gelator, required for obtaining good transparency.
The results also pointed out that although the introduction of TiO2-NPs or TiO2-NPs/graphene partially affects the
hydrogel properties, as in both cases, G′
decreases. This effect is more evident for hydrogel 3 (H-TG). Nevertheless, frequency sweep analysis (Figure S2) pointed out that for all obtained hydrogels, both G′ and G″ were almost independent
of the frequency in the range from 0.1 to 100 rad·s–1 (always with G′ > G″),
confirming the “solidlike” rheological behavior of the
hydrogels and hence the stability of the hydrogel structure required
for the photocatalytic application.

Step-strain experiments
were performed to check the thixotropic
behavior of 1 (H), 2 (H-T), and 3
(H-TG) on the molecular level. Strain values within and above
the LVE (linear viscoelastic range) region were consecutively
applied to the hydrogels, which lose their “solidlike”
behavior (G′ < G″)
when the strain is applied above their LVE region and quickly go back
to a “solidlike” state (G′ > G″) if the strain is applied in the LVE region of
the hydrogels (Figure 3). The three hydrogels show a thixotropic behavior, even though the G′ and G″ values of the graphene-doped
hydrogel 3 (H-TG) are lower than the 1 (H) and 2 (H-T)G′ and G″ values.

Figure 3 Values of storage moduli G′
(black) and
loss moduli G″ (red) recorded during a step-strain
experiment performed on (A) hydrogel 1 (H), (B) hydrogel 2 (H-T), and (C) hydrogel 3 (H-TG).

More information on the nature of hydrogels 1 (H), 2 (H-T), and 3 (H-TG) was
obtained by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the corresponding aerogels obtained
by freeze-drying these samples (Figure 4). These aerogels show a different morphology, but
they are all characterized by complex patterns with a rough orientation.
Moreover, in aerogel 3 (H-TG) (Figure 4C and magnification), we can notice the presence
of some small aggregates responsible for the formation of a less homogeneous
hydrogel, in agreement with the results obtained from the rheological
experiments.

Photodegradation Experiments
As mentioned, here, we
propose an experimental approach based on fluorescence detection for
investigating the photodegradation of a target molecule in the gel.
As a main difference with respect to other methods based on fluorescence,
we propose to use the same excitation beam and the same excitation
wavelength for both photoactivating the photocatalyst TiO2 and exciting the target fluorophore RhB (see Figure 2). As a main advantage,
this approach allows the continuous real-time detection of the target
dye concentration during the process using a conventional fluorimeter
equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as an excitation source.

To
select a suitable irradiation wavelength, we analyzed the absorption
spectra of hydrogel 1 (H) of the TiO2-NPs
(0.2 mg/mL) and RhB (1.0 μM) in a cuvette with
a 0.5 cm optical path (spectra are shown in Figure 5). These spectra demonstrate that it is possible
to excite simultaneously the TiO2-NPs and RhB upon irradiation in the UV spectral region when they are incorporated
in the hydrogel (as sketched in Figure 2).

Figure 5 Absorption spectrum of hydrogel 1 (H) (black
line)
of the TiO2 NPs (0.2 mg/mL, red line) and RhB (×20, 1 μM, green line). Fluorescence spectrum of RhB (filled yellow) and spectrum of the irradiation source
(filled cyan). Inset: photographs of samples of hydrogels 1
(H), 2 (H-T), and 3 (H-TG) (from
left to right, respectively) prepared with gelator Fmoc-L-Tyr-D-Oxd-OH
in 0.5% concentration.

In fact, as foreseen, the hydrogel presents an edge of absorption
around 310 nm because of the characteristic absorption spectra of
the Fmoc chromophore26 that is present
in the gelator structure.10,43,44 The hydrogel transmittance is T > 60% for wavelength
λ > 320 nm, and hence the photocatalyst TiO2-NPs
incorporated in the hydrogel in 1 (H) can be efficiently
excited at 340 ± 10 nm using the fluorimeter excitation beam
as an irradiation source (the spectral profile is shown in Figure 5).

Additionally,
under these excitation conditions, RhB absorbs a minor
fraction of the excitation light, and its fluorescence
can be exploited as a diagnostic signal to follow the photodegradation
of this dye during the photocatalytic experiments.

To investigate
the TiO2 photocatalytic activity in the
hydrogel, we prepared three samples like 1 (H), 2 (H-T), and 3 (H-TG), all containing a small
concentration (1.0 μM) of RhB. For clarity, these
samples will be referred as 4 (HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG). Hydrogel rheological properties were
not affected by the presence of small concentrations of RhB (1.0 μM) in the hydrogels.

Results, reported in Figure 6, show that there
is a strong decrease in RhB emission during the first
hour of irradiation in the case of 5 (HR-T) and 6 (HR-TG). By contrast, in the reference
hydrogel 4 (HR), the fluorescence signal decreases only
by about 20% during the first 10 min (600 s), and then it reaches
a plateau.45,46 Hence, as the fluorescence intensity
is proportional to the fluorophore concentration, under these experimental
conditions,47,48 we can gather that after 60 min
of irradiation, the RhB concentration in the reference
sample 4 (HR) is still 80% of the initial one, whereas
the dye is completely degraded in the TiO2-containing sample 5 (HR-T) and a residual 25% survived in 6 (HR-TG). These results clearly demonstrate that (i) the TiO2-NPs
photodecompose efficiently in RhB, but (ii) the introduction
of graphene in hydrogel 6 (HR-TG) leads to a photoactivity
decrease of TiO2-NPs, in contrast with what was observed
in other matrixes.49

Figure 6 Fluorescence intensity
at 585 nm of RhB as a function
of irradiation time (λexc = 340 nm) in sample 4 (HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG).

Going into more detail, a simple
parameter suitable to quantify
the rate of the photodegradation process is the half-life t1/2, which is defined as the irradiation time
at which the concentration value of the reactant (RhB) becomes half of the initial one. The half-life t1/2 of RhB corresponds to 12 and 23 min of
irradiation for 5 (HR-T) and 6 (HR-TG),
respectively.

To go into more details of the photodegradation
kinetics, we analyzed
the kinetics traces of Figure 6 according to a (pseudo) first-order model (see the Supporting Information). From the data analysis,
we obtain values of the rate constant k = 8.0 ±
0.1 × 10–4 s–1 and k = 4.0 ± 0.1 × 10–4 s–1 for 5 (HR-T) and 6 (HR-TG), respectively.
This result further confirms that the presence of graphene in the
hydrogel apparently causes a decrease in the TiO2-NP photocatalytic
activity. Indeed, SEM and rheological analyses clearly indicate that
graphene affects the matrix morphology and causes a homogeneity decrease
of the TiO2-NP dispersion (see the Supporting Information): this alteration is the actual reason
for the decreased photocatalytic activity of 6 (HR-TG) when compared to 5 (HR-T).

As far as the mechanism
of photodegradation is concerned, the observed
(pseudo) first-order kinetics is consistent with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model, which is the most representative in describing the kinetic
degradation of xanthene dyes as RhB in heterogeneous
photocatalysis. This model takes into consideration the contribution
of both dye adsorption on the photocatalyst surface and dye diffusion.50

In view of future applications, it is
very important to understand
whether, in the hydrogel, the target molecules RhB can
freely diffuse or they are bound either to the gelator fibers or to
the TiO2-NPs. Free diffusion of the pollutant moiety is
in fact essential for the development of a material suitable for continuous
recyclable materials for water decontamination.

We hence investigated
the interactions between the target dye molecules
and the microenvironment by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopies, using fluorescence anisotropy to measure the local
mobility of RhB in 4 (HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG).

Quenching of RhB fluorescence has been reported to
occur upon absorption on TiO2 or onto the honeycomb carbon
structure of graphene.51,52 Hence, we recorded and compared
the fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of RhB (λexc = 530 nm) of 4 (HR), 5
(HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG). On the basis of the fluorescence
spectra, shown in Figure 7, we concluded that no quenching of the fluorescence of RhB could be observed in 5 (HR-T) and 6
(HR-TG).

Figure 7 Fluorescence spectra (λexc = 530 nm)
of RhB in sample 4 (HR) (black line), 5 (HR-T) (red line), and 6 (HR-TG) (green line)
and fluorescence
anisotropy of the same samples: black, red, and green triangles, respectively.

This conclusion was further supported
by time-resolved fluorescence
measurements. Excited-state lifetimes were measured by time-correlated
single photon counting. Fluorescence decays recorded for RhB in 4 (HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG) were fitted with a single exponential model to give excited-state
lifetimes of 3.4, 3.7, and 3.6 ns, respectively. These values match
with the lifetime of the fluorophore in water solution, confirming
that no quenching of the fluorescence of the target dye occurs in 4 (HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG).48,53,54

As mentioned, fluorescence
anisotropy (r, dimensionless)
measurements allow to determine the rotational mobility of a fluorophore
in a given environment. Values of r close to 0.4
were reported for rhodamine molecules in the case of strongly hindered
rotation,55,56 whereas the same molecules have an r very close to 0 when free to diffuse in poorly viscous
solvent such as water.

Fluorescence anisotropy spectra of RhB in 4
(HR), 5 (HR-T), and 6 (HR-TG) are
shown in Figure 7 (triangles);
in all three cases, the anisotropy around the maximum fluorescence
is very low (0.02–0.03) and similar to the value measured in
pure water. This result confirms that the dye molecules can diffuse
fast in the hydrogel (hence, the diffusion time is much shorter than
the excited-state lifetime) and are dissolved in the hydrogel water
channels rather than adsorbed on the gelator fibers.

Conclusions
In this paper, we reported the incorporation of TiO2-NPs (also in combination with graphene platelets) into highly biocompatible
hydrogels, whose properties have been analyzed by rheological and
SEM analyses.

These hydrogels show a high water content and
good transparency
to solar light, and they degrade a pollutant model molecule with good
efficiency upon semiconductor NP irradiation.

Interestingly,
our experiments demonstrate that light penetrates
inside the hydrogel and that photodegradation occurs in the bulk of
the material. This important result was achieved by optimizing the
composition and the methodology of production of the hydrogel to avoid
sedimentation and segregation of the TiO2-NPs (as demonstrated
by the SEM analysis).

We also proved that while photodegradation
of the target molecule
(pollutant model) efficiently occurs upon irradiation, the photogenerated
reactive species does not alter the matrix properties: rheology of
the hydrogel, in fact, is not modified either by the incorporation
of the photocatalysts or upon their irradiation.

Finally, we
investigated the actual mobility of the pollutant molecules
in the hydrogel on the microscopic level by steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopies. Our results demonstrated that
these molecules are not absorbed either on the hydrogel fibers or
on the TiO2-NPs, suggesting that pollutant molecules are
rather solubilized in the hydrogel water channel. This result is very
important in view of the development of photocatalytic water-permeable
materials for continuous decontamination of water in fluxing systems.

All chemicals and solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, VWR or Iris Biotech and were used as received.
Acetonitrile was distilled under an inert atmosphere before use. Milli-Q
water (Millipore, resistivity = 18.2 mΩ·cm) was used throughout.

Synthesis of Fmoc-L-Tyr-D-Oxd-OH
The compound was synthesized
from D-Thr and Fmoc-L-Tyr(t-Bu)-OH following a multistep
procedure in solution, reported in ref (24).

Hydrogel Preparation
A portion of
Fmoc-L-Tyr-D-Oxd-OH
(5 mg) was placed in a test tube (diameter: 8 mm); then Milli-Q water
(0.97 mL) and a 1 M aqueous NaOH (1.3 equiv) were added; and the mixture
was stirred until sample dissolution. Finally, we added 1.4 equiv
of glucono-δ-lactone, and the mixture was left still for 16
h at room temperature. For more details, see Scheme S1.

Aerogel Preparation
Some samples
of hydrogels 1–3 were freeze-dried using a BENCHTOP
Freeze Dry System
LABCONCO 7740030 with the following procedure: The hydrogel was prepared
into an Eppendorf test tube at room temperature. After 16 h, the samples
were deepened in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and then freeze-dried
for 24 h in vacuo (0.2 mBar) at −50 °C.

gun scanning electron microscope. Conditions: EHT = 20 keV –
variable pressure: 100 Pa—images in secondary electrons.

Rheology
Rheology experiments were carried out on an
Anton Paar rheometer MCR 102 using parallel plate configuration (25

of 23 °C controlled by the integrated Peltier system and a Julabo
AWC100 cooling system.

Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis)

collected by using an optical path of 0.5 cm cuvette at 25 with a
Cary 300 UV–vis double beam spectrophotometer, having an empty
cuvette as a reference.

Steady-State and Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Spectroscopies and
Fluorescence Anisotropy
Fluorescence spectra were collected
with an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorimeter equipped with a photomultiplier
Hamamatsu R928P, and the samples were analyzed in disposable cuvettes
with an optical path length of 0.5 cm. Emission spectra: λexc = 530 nm; λem: 540–700 nm. Excitation
spectra: λexc = 330–600 nm, λem = 620 nm. Fluorescence anisotropy: λexc = 530 nm;
λem: 550–650 nm.

Photodegradation Experiments
The kinetic analysis was
carried on by continuously monitoring the degradation of RhB acquiring the fluorescence spectra with a Horiba FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorimeter
upon excitation/irradiation at 340 nm (10 nm slits). Experimental
parameters are reported in detail in Scheme S2.
