In
present study, we have synthesized intrinsically conductive poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
via cyclopolymerization
technique, and further it is composited with the NiFe2O4 to fabricate pellet for electrical and electronic applications.
The synthesized polymer I–V characteristics were obtained by two-probe measurement technique.
The results suggest that the high current density of the synthesized
polymer was in the range of 1.2 × 10–5–3.1
× 10–5 S/cm, which attributes to the potentially
induced hoping charge-carrier mechanism
within the conjugated poly(1,6-heptadiynes). NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) composite
pellets were fabricated by utilizing hydraulic pelletizer. The sample’s
electrical measurements were performed via broad-band dielectric impedance
spectroscopy, wherein the composite permittivity was about ε
= 45 (100 Hz to 10 kHz), which attributes to the NiFe2O4 and poly(1,6-heptadiynes) phases; further, this describes
the capacitance, which improved from 0.3 to 0.1 pf at 1 kHz. Also,
these results suggest the reduced equivalent series resistance (72.1–1
MHz), which attributes to the incorporated intrinsically conducting
poly(1,6-heptadiynes). Thus, the reduced dissipation factor (DF =
0.0032) was observed from impedance characteristics of a nanocomposite.
Moreover, the improved Q-factor was observed, which
was about 8.1–310 at 1 kHz. The resistance and capacitance
time constant was also computed to be about 0.29 μs at 1 kHz
for NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite.
Furthermore, the nanocomposite-enabled capacitor gravimetric energy
density and power densities were calculated to be about 0.00575 mJ/g
and 9.91 W/g, respectively. Additionally, thermal threatening, that
is, heat generated within the capacitor, Ploss is also estimated for the nanocomposite capacitor, which improved
from 0.0006 to 8.9 × 10–6, and these results
suggest improved nanocomposite thermal stability. Further, the delineated
quantities were compared to the commercially available configurations
of tantalum hybrid capacitors and Al and Ta electrolytic capacitors,
including carbon electrochemical capacitors, which suggest that the
reported nanocomposites could be a suitable candidate for electrical
and electronic applications.

==== Body
Introduction
In active and passive
components consisted of modern electronics,
passive elements (resistors, inductors, and capacitors) occupy 80%
of circuit board area.1,2 Among them, capacitors can be
a useful component for tuning and filtering, bypassing, decoupling,
and noise suppression.3,4 High area occupied by the integration
of passive components leads to parasitic effects and thus to lower
reliability.3,4 Therefore, increased fabrication
emphasizes on miniaturized electronic components and their devices
fascinate the demands of electronic technology. Although electronic
miniaturization facilitates reduction of energy consumption, lightweight
and economically stable miniaturization of passive embedded technology
has anomalous effects on the electronic components, probably due to
the stray capacitance and short-circuit-effect-induced insulation
failure.5 Parasitic effects of integrated
passive elements hinder the adequate power supply in electronic integrated
circuit (IC) technology.6 Simultaneous
switching noise is one of the common manifestations of parasitic effects,
which could be attributed to the distributed power network, and passive
inductance prevents rapid changes in currents as required by the higher-frequency
ICs of today’s technology.6 Moreover,
the potential drop from the change in inductance causes glitches on
the power supply, which could facilitate false switching current.
To overcome these abnormalities in current electronic industry and
to improve the reliability and performance of electronic devices,
the miniaturization with functional material properties is keenly
required while maintaining reduced sizes such as higher dielectric
constant, frequency, and temperature stability. Recently, researchers
have revealed the essential factors for efficient functional electronics,
which are high dielectric constant, proper dielectric dispersion at
higher frequency, and good interfacial dispersion between the polymer
and matrix.6−8 Tummala et al. reported the dielectric constant
(20–30) of organically facilitated process enabled ceramic
composites to meet electronic high frequency miniaturized decoupling
components.9 Although the high dielectric
constant with functional properties induces the improved performance
of miniaturized electronics, in some electronic applications, the
lower dielectric permittivity is essentially required,7−9 which permits the varactors (a semiconductor diode with capacitance)
to be fabricated with picofarad capacitance for microwave circuits,
which are being tuned with the direct-current (DC) voltage level <200
V.10 These developments facilitate low-cost
phase shifters for phased array antennae as well as tunable oscillators
and tunable filters for wireless applications such as cellular and
personal communication service.10 The challenges
could be high dielectric loss and picofarad operating voltage of capacitors,
lower Q-quality factor at required frequencies, and
insufficient power-handling capabilities of tuning elements.10

Recently, high energy storage materials
have attracted attention
to meet the demand for large-scale practical applications. Inorganic
polymer composites are to be considered as promising energy-storage
materials due to their dielectric permittivity with low loss, dielectric
strength, and high processability.11−15 For example, BaTiO3@TiO3 core–shell
materials in a polyvinylidene matrix composite exhibit improved permittivity
(66.2) and low loss (0.048); further, the results suggest that the
discharge energy density 20 J/cm3 was attained at an applied
electric
field of 646 kV/mm.11 Zhang et al. reveal
that the energy density relates to the applied electric field (either
directly or inversely); for example, synthesized titanium dioxide/lead
zirconate titanate nanowire arrays exhibit an energy density of 6.9
J/cm3 at a lower intensity of applied electrical fields
143 kV/mm, which is attributed to the high relative permittivity at
1 kHz. Further, the applied fields increase, for example, 400–600
kV/mm, which may bring more challenges relating to the failure probability.12 According to some researchers, such type of
organopolymer composites enabled that high energy density with low
power loss and high dielectric strength characteristics are desirable
candidates for electrical and electronic applications such as embedded
capacitors for power systems, multilayer capacitors, piezoelectric
devices, and gate insulators to meet the current demands.11−19

In this context, we have attempted to explore poly(1,6-heptadiynes),
which was synthesized via cyclopolymerization (CP) technique. The I–V characteristics of synthesized
poly(1,6-heptadiynes) were scrutinized via two-probe conductivity
technique. The pellets’ (NiFe2O4 and
NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite
pellets’) dielectric permittivity (ε), dissipation factor
(DF), impedance (Z), capacitance (C), and quality factor (Q) were reported for the
first time. Also, the reduced equivalent series resistance (ESR),
resistance and capacitance (RC) time constant, gravimetric
energy density, and power density of a nanocomposite-enabled capacitor
were quantified and then compared to those of the commercially available
tantalum hybrid capacitors and the Al and Ta electrolytic capacitors,
including carbon electrochemical capacitors. In addition, electronic
application assistive capacitor Ploss =
power loss and charge discharge is discussed in this work.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Raw materials (nickel ferrites (NiFe2O4) (particle size ca. 30–70 nm and density
∼5.13 g/cc)) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., India.
Malonic ester was procured from Alfa Aesar. Sodium hydride, propargyl
bromide, Hoveyda-Grubbs’ second-generation catalyst, and ethyl
vinyl ether were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Diethyl ether,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, hexane, chloroform, acetonitrile,
and anhydrous sodium sulfate were acquired from Merck India Ltd. Ethanol
(purity ∼99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. All
of the solvents were dried over calcium hydride before use, and all
raw materials and solvents were used as received without any further
purification.

Characterization Techniques
Two-probe
measurement (Keithley
Instruments, U.K.) technique was used to analyze the DC conductivity
of synthesized poly(1,6-heptadiynes). The room-temperature broad-band
dielectric impedance characteristics (dielectric permittivity, impedance,
and capacitance) were measured according to the standard ASTM-D150
over the 1–10 MHz frequency range via a broad-band impedance
analyzer (Novacontrol Alpha, Germany).

Need and Necessity of NiFe2O4 and Poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
for Electrical and Electronic Applications
Researchers have
implemented various kinds of shielding materials for electrical and
electronic devices to shield abnormal radiations.20−25 Although the shielding materials were extensively explored, in modern
television receiving equipment and other high-frequency military and
commercial devices, it is customary to shield generators in metallic
shields so that the electromagnetic interference generated by the
radiations near the adjacent devices can be prevented.26 During filament heating supplying low frequency
of alternative currents, for example, in supplying DC potentials for
grid circuits or for plates, considerable high-frequency current will
leave the shielding enclosures by traveling along the supply leads,
as a result, spurious radiation.26 To avoid
this problem, researchers have fabricated capacitors that form low
reactance at high frequency to the ground at the shielding enclosures.
The capacitors are essentially required to be employed at the shield
boundaries to prevent high-frequency current-induced spurious radiations.26 Nanonickel and its ferritic compounds were widely
utilized in electrodes for ceramic capacitors.27,28 Reports on the manufacture of electrodes for capacitors using ultrafine
nickel powder27 and the manufacture of
microwave absorption of nickel ferritic compound28 suggest that nickel powder and its compounds are not limited
to this application, which can be used as an electrode material for
secondary cell, fuel cell, and others such as thin-layer laminated
ceramic capacitors due to their reduced electrical resistance and
it prevents the delamination or cracks of thin multilayered capacitor
when the capacitor is under stress. Furthermore, easy preparation
and high corrosion resistance, saturation magnetization, superior
antioxidation, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and application-desired
structural compatibility are important characteristics of nickel-based
compounds that can be used in electrical and electronic applications.27,28

The advantages and disadvantages of NiFe2O4 for electrical and electronic applications are provided in Table 1.

The preparation of soluble polymers via cyclopolymerization
can
now be effectively extended to avoid the difficulty associated with
the formation of insoluble intractable conducting polymers when synthesized
through conventional methods.29,30 Cyclopolymerization-derived
poly(1,6-heptadiynes) and their derivative are intrinsically conjugated
polymers, which facilitate the conductivity via electron hopping and
tunneling mechanism. Although the activation energy of cyclopolymerized
poly(1,6-heptadiynes) (13 kcal/mol (0.6 eV)) is similar to that of trans-polyacetylene (13.8 kcal/mol (0.579 eV)), the rate
of oxidation of poly(1,6-heptadiynes) is more than 10 times that of
polyacetylene, which leads to the higher oxidative stability of poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
than polyacetylene.31 Moreover, poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
and their derivative polymers were mostly soluble in organic solvents,
as well as stable to air oxidation and thermal stresses without losing
intact and attractive mechanical properties and film-processable characteristics.32,33 These properties are essentially desirable and facilitate the probability
of electrical and electronic components or devices fabrication, which
further enhance the efficiency and the life cycle stability under
influenced force-field conditions.

Our invention relates to
the capacitors for high frequencies and
particularly used as shielding head to prevent high-frequency currents
generated by spurious radiation by enabling low reactive and resistive
component to the ground when the supply leads are superimposed.26 For frequency stability at higher frequencies
and due to the electrical and electronic application compatibility,
we used nickel ferrites composited with poly(1,6-heptadiynes), which
further facilitates the reduction of intrinsic resistance of nickel
ferrite composite to enable low resistance path to the ground.

Synthesis
of Diacetylene (DA) and Poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
The monomer
and poly(1,6-heptadiynes)polymer were synthesized according
to the previously reported protocol by Shunmugam et al.34 We have used THF as a solvent to dissolve diacetylene
monomer under inert conditions (Synthesis of Diacetylene (DA) Monomer, Supporting Information (Figure S1a,b)). Then, the reaction was carried out for 2 h, followed
by the addition of second-generation Hoveyda-Grubbs’ catalyst.
Finally, the reaction was quenched by ethyl vinyl ether simultaneously
precipitated in diethyl ether. The as-obtained synthetic compound
was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) (Poly(1,6-heptadiynes) H NMR and GPC Characterization, Supporting Information (Figure S1a,b)).

Sample Fabrication for Electrical Measurements
To prepare
the pellet for electrical measurements as per the ASTM-D150, we have
implemented the pellet-pressing technique using Atlas hydraulic pellet
press. First, nanosized nickel ferrite granules were mixed with poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
(Confirmation by NMR and GPC, Supporting Information (Figure S1a,b)) under an agitate mortar for segregating the particles.
The nanocomposite mass ratio was about 1:20 (poly(1,6-heptadiynes)/NiFe2O4), which was mixed under vacuum environment to
avoid additional moisture absorption from the ground and smaller oxide
particles. Then, 0.6 g of the nanocomposite was pressed in a ⌀10
mm high-end evacuated die (Atlas: GS03100) under an applied load of
15 tons for 30 s by a microprocessor-controlled hydraulic press. It
facilitated a dense pellet of thickness 1.5 mm and diameter 10 mm
with weight 0.6 g, which is illustrated in Figure 1.

NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite pellets are illustrated as shown in Figure 2. These images describe the
surface morphology, in which we can observe nanoparticle distribution
in NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite.
Further, this significance can be elucidated by the polymer filling
factor. The nickel ferrite pellet micrograph demonstrates porous morphology,
whereas in the case of nanocomposite surface morphology changes due
to the addition of poly(1,6-heptadiynes), the presence of pores is
not observed in the micrograph. Thus, it suggests that most of the
pores were filled by the poly(1,6-heptadiynes) filling factor and
it is also observed that some of the nickel particles form agglomerations
on the surface.

Investigation of Electrical
Properties
I–V Characteristics
of Poly(1,6-heptadiynes) Polymer
The poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
sample was coated on a dry glass substrate to evaluate the electrical
DC conductivity via a two-probe technique under laboratory conditions.
The dissimilar materials (electrode material and sample) are put in
intimate contact, where the energy barrier could attribute to an interface
between two dissimilar materials due to their impedance mismatch,
which probably prevents easy electron injection.35,36 Minimizing the contact resistance at the interface for accurate
measurement is an essential requirement.36 Hence, we have introduced highly conductive silver ink electrode
contacts, which result in uninterrupted electron conduction between
metal–polymer and polymer–metal interfaces. To measure
the conductivity under low-energy and bias-voltage conditions, a voltage
ramp was applied across split electrodes in two-probe measurement
technique using a source voltmeter. Then, the steady-state electronic
current at each voltage was measured. The load-line mapping approach
was utilized to measure the conductivity.35 The polymer film current density value was about 1.2 × 10–5–3.1 × 10–5 S/cm (Figure 3) over the range
of applied voltages (20–60 V) of the sample thickness ∼30
μm. These results are comparable to the conductivity of iodine-doped
poly(1,6-heptadiynes) demonstrated by Gibson et al.,37 who demonstrated the electrical
conductivity of poly(1,6-heptadiynes) changes by a factor of 1010 from 10–12 to 10–2 Ω–1 cm–1 over a period of 60 min. Also,
the results show analogous conductivity of freestanding stability
of blended poly(1,6-heptadiynes)/poly(vinylethyleimidozolium dicyanamide)
films reported by Buchmeiser et al.38 The
conductivity of blended poly(1,6-heptadiynes)/poly(vinylethyleimidozolium
dicyanamide) thin film was measured via Novocontrol and dielectric
spectrometer equipped with alpha analyzer. The obtained conductivity
was about 10–5 S/cm at 107 Hz, which
attributes to π–π* electron transfer by the conjugated
polymer backbone.38 These results indicate
that the conductivity of the present system was probably due to the
highly specific backbone structure.

Figure 3 I–V characteristics of
poly(1,6-heptadiynes).

The current density “J” can
be expressed
as Jα exp–βd, where “d” is the
barrier width and β is the tunneling decay coefficient. In Figure 3, the current density J explains an exponential state to the applied voltages;
this is probably due to potentially induced charge transfer in poly(1,6-heptadiynes)-conjugated
chain length.36 Moreover, J probably demonstrates the non-resonant bond tunneling in poly(1,6-heptadiynes),
which is one of the charge-transport mechanisms in the metal–polymer–metal
junction.39 This can be interpreted with
the aid of “β” the tunneling decay coefficient,
and it can be attained by the slope of linear fit. The quantified
tunneling decay coefficient values are listed in Table 2, wherein we observe the increase
in bias voltages, while β value decreases, which would reveal
incremental current density.39 Additionally,
this consequence concerns the molecular junction exhibiting voltage-dependent
current density (Figure 3), which is in good agreement with the results reported by Salomon
et al.40 The two-probe measurement approximation
of I–V characteristics suggests
that poly(1,6-heptadiynes) can behave as a conducting polymer, wherein
the polymer’s conjugation structure instigates the charge-transport
mechanism. The charge transport in five-membered ring poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
is different from that in the six-membered ring structure of a polymer
chain. These ring sizes are the direct consequences of the addition
mode of the monomer to the initiator. Usually, the five-membered ring
structure is prominent for the most electronic applications due to
their bathochromic shift and higher conductivity.41 This was the significant characteristic of the as reported
poly(1,6-heptadiynes); hence, higher conductivity was attained.

Electrical Properties of NiFe2O4/Poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
Nanocomposite
The capacitors are dielectric material-dependent
passive components, wherein the polarization-induced dielectric permittivity
stores the electric charge. The electric field-induced net polarization
“P” contributes electronic, atomic,
and dipolar polarization mechanisms and consequently intrinsic dielectric
permittivity. Further, these features can be explained efficiently
with the aid of Clausius–Mossotti relation, as shown in eq 1(42,43) 1  where Pe is the
electronic polarization, Pa is the atomic
polarization, Pd is the dipolar polarization, K is the total dielectric constant, which is expressed as K = (ε – 1)/(ε + 2), M is the molecular weight, ε is the dielectric constant, and d is the density. The net K is an analytical
interpretation that reveals the dielectric permittivity of a mixture
of two materials, which is further in proportion to the masses. The
same can be analyzed with the aid of the Clausius–Mossotti
relation and is shown in eq 2(42,43) 2  In dielectric
composite materials, the external
field-induced dielectric polarization arises from the finite displacement
of dipoles and their rotations.44 In the
atomic scale, distribution of electron cloud distortion is pre-eminent
for the dipole-induced polarization. Likewise, in the molecular scale,
non-bond interactions and/or physical rotation of molecular dipoles
are dominant for polarization mechanism.45 Such type of molecule-induced polarization in gases and liquids
is due to the free rotation of the molecular dipoles, which is probably
due to the free dipole angular momentum. However, in the case of solids
(e.g., in polymers), the molecular dipole rotations are restricted
and therefore the dipoles do not significantly contribute to the quantitative
dielectric permittivity.46 Hence, in Figure 4, the observed dielectric
permittivity response value is only due to the nickel ferrite oxides
and its ferromagnetic resonance attributed relaxation phenomena, which
is consistent with the results obtained by Ahmed et al.47 However, permittivity is a frequency-dependent
hypothesis; hence, an exponential decay was observed in Figure 4, as the applied electric fields
increase from 101 to 107 Hz.36 These permittivity characteristics are attributed to the
space charge and dipolar polarization mechanisms in NiFe2O4 as well as in NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite,48 where the polarization-dependent
typical relaxation times are in the range of ca. 10–1–10–9 s.49,50Figure 4 shows the low permittivity
of NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite
compared to NiFe2O4 alone, which is probably
due to the conducting properties of the conjugated poly(1,6-heptadiynes).51,52 The permanent dipoles existing in a poly(1,6-heptadiynes) polymer
are unable to follow over the applied frequency range, which is probably
due to the polymer in the vicinity of nickel ferrite nanoparticles
restricting the molecule-induced dipole angular momentum;53 consequently, charge transport is high throughout
the polymer (between nickel ferrite particles, where the polymer can
act as a medium for charge transport) and hence the non-resonant (frequency-independent)
permittivity characteristics over the frequency range (102–105 Hz) was observed. Further, the non-resonant
permittivity-influenced polymer conducting properties can be elucidated
via diffusing coefficient of the polymer, if the self-diffusing coefficient
of the polymer is low, which results in high conductivity of the polymer
due to more number of nonbond interactions induced by the hoping charge
carrier mechanism.54−56 This, in turn, depends on molecule density in accordance
with the Clausius–Mossotti relation and intermolecular forces.42,43 Moreover, in NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite, the polymer molecule behaves qualitatively like a polar
substance, which connects the two nickel ferrite nanoparticles and
consequently has higher charge-transport capability. Also, this can
help in the reduction of τ = RC time constant
by reducing “R” of the composite medium.57 Further, this consequence can be elucidated
with the aid of loss and impedance characteristics, which were obtained
from impedance spectroscopy measurement.

Figure 4 NiFe2O4 and nanocomposite’s dielectric
permittivity as a function of frequency.

The loss characteristics of a dielectric are also known as
dissipation
factor (DF). The dissipation factors (DFs) of the NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposites are illustrated in Figure 5. The decreased DF of the NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite is apparent over
a wide frequency range of 10 Hz to 10 MHz (Table 3). This might be explained as the fact that
the conduction of a polymer, which is further related to the DC electrical
conductivity of poly(1,6-heptadiynes) (Figure 3), contributes to the change in DF value
less significantly as the frequency increases.58 Such a consequence further can be elucidated with the aid
of mathematical relation , where ε″, ε′,
σ, and ω are the imaginary and real dielectric permittivity,
electrical conductivity and frequency of the materials, respectively.58 However, in nanocomposite, change in losses
is more significant at lower frequencies, which is due to the reduction
in the contact resistance and intrinsic resistivity of that medium.59,60

factor (DF) as a function of frequency.

In current electronic technology, the motivation
to use capacitors
in interdigital electronics and electrical appliances are based on
their loss factor value; hence, it is essential to analyze the Q-factor.59,60 Dissipation factor (DF) is used
to extract the Q-factor value, which is an inverse
relation to the DF .58,60,10Table 3 shows the
quantified quality factor “Q” of the
NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite. The nanocomposite quality factor was >20 from 200
to
105 Hz and 310 at 104 Hz, which is ∼37
times higher than that of the NiFe2O4 alone.
In general, the Q-quality factor can be defined as
the ratio of resistance to reactance.60 Nanocomposite results suggest that the high Q-factor
attributes to the reduced intrinsic resistance of that medium. These
characteristics are in good agreement with the impedance characteristics
that were obtained from the broad-band impedance spectroscopy measurement
(Figure 6). Therefore,
higher Q-factor in addition to the dielectric tunability
facilitates the NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite for capacitor.

impedance
(Z′ and Z″) as a function
of frequency: (a) Z′ = resistance; (b) Z″ = reactance.

The impedance (Z = Z′
+ Z″) characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6a, where Z′ gives the resistance value and Z″ gives the reactance value.61 The
NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite shows higher impedance values at lower frequency (<102 Hz), wherein the higher resistance Z′
of the NiFe2O4 sample at lower frequencies (<102 Hz) is due to the contact resistance between electrodes and
dielectric material, and the intrinsic material resistance.61−63 However, in the case of NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
composite, the Z′ resistance elucidates the
frequency-independent value, which is due to the conducting properties
of the conjugated poly(1,6-heptadiynes) as an intermediate medium
located between the nickel ferrite particles.64,65 Further, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) quantifications
of pellets elucidate these characteristics, where the nanocomposite
pellet exhibits ESR 72 times lower resistance compared to the NiFe2O4 sample.64,65 The quantified resistance
values for the NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite pellets are shown in Table 4. In Figure 6b, the reactance Z″ is a frequency-dependent parameter, which is in good agreement
with the mathematical relation C = 1/2πfZ″, as described by Miller et al., where C is the capacitance and Z″ is the
reactance.66 The capacitance can be computed
by using the
above mathematical relation; the computed capacitance values at different
frequencies are reported in Table 4.63,67 These quantified capacitance
values are in good agreement with the frequency-dependent capacitance
characteristics illustrated as shown in Figure 7.

a measure of capacitor time constant, which is a pre-eminent parametric
feature for estimating the minimum time required to charge and discharge
stored energy.63,67 The time constant can be attained
by the combination of resistance and capacitance (Figures 6 and 7) of NiFe2O4 as well as NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite at different frequencies.
According to the impedance characteristics, the total impedance of
a capacitor can be represented as , which includes
the reactive (Xc = capacitive and XL = inductive)
and resistive components. The self-resonance frequency fr is an important observation attained from the impedance
characteristics. The resonance frequency can be calculated in accordance
with the equation ; at this frequency,
the impedance is equal
to the equivalent series resistance (ESR).68 Below the self-resonance fr, the capacitive
component “Xc” is dominant
and hence the component behaves like a capacitor. Likewise, the self-resonance
frequency-inductive component “XL” is dominant and hence the component behaves like an inductor.68 Therefore, the R and C-induced time constant for a NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes) nanocomposite
capacitor can be calculated at 1 kHz or 1 Hz frequency since their
capacitance and resistance values are insensitive at that frequency.67 The calculated RC values were
about 3.19 ms at 1 Hz and 36.30 μs at 1 kHz for a NiFe2O4 sample, and about 20.26 μs at 1 Hz and 0.29 μs
at 1 kHz for a NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite. These results are in comparable agreement with the
commercially available tantalum hybrid capacitors and are at least
3 orders of magnitude smaller than the commercially available Al and
Ta electrolytic capacitors, including carbon electrochemical capacitors.67 The maximum storage energy capacity of a nanocomposite
capacitor can be calculated using the equation , where C is the DC capacitance
and VM is the rated voltage.67 Further, the gravimetric energy density can
be obtained by dividing Emax by weight
of a composite, wherein the nanocomposite DC capacitance (CDC = 1.1 and 0.51 pF at 50 V) was used to compute
the gravimetric energy density, and the calculated energy density
values were about 0.0159 and 0.00575 mJ/g, respectively.

Moreover,
the capacitor power density can be obtained from the
alternating current (AC) impedance “Z”
measurements by assuming the load resistance condition Rload = R.67,69 This complete
consequence explained the circuit representation as shown in Figure 8, where, in accordance
with the maximum power transfer theorem, it can be seen that the maximum
power is delivered to the load only when Rload = R, at which the maximum power can be expressed
by the mathematical relation .67 From the
above relation, the ratio of energy density to time constant (RC) gives the power density, which is a gravimetric power
density and is about 0.019 kW/g. These quantifications are in comparable
agreement with the hybrid capacitors, Al and Ta electrolytic capacitors,
as reported by Zheng et al.67

Thermal Stability Parameters of a Composite for Capacitor Application
Besides the dielectric properties, harsh environments such as high-temperature
capability, aggressive media, and radiation exposure are the primary
concerns for the capacitor applications. A clear future requirement
is to save weight, volume, and low energy loss in unfriendly environments
like high temperatures.70 In the current
system of electronic components, for example, temperature rise in
capacitor core, failure occurs probably due to temperature-induced
loses. The degradation and early failure of electronic components
are also due to the utilization of self-heat generated materials.
The mechanisms that are prominently responsible for the losses in
a capacitor include the dielectric material and its inherent power
losses and heat retention properties, electrode system and ohmic losses,
end connection schooping, and termination method (wire, tab, or terminals).
To overcome these thermal impediments and losses in the capacitor,
it is needed to choose high-temperature-stabilized low-loss dielectric
materials for new capacitor design. Researchers have reported various
high-temperature dielectric composites for the capacitors to meet
the higher-temperature operation.10 However,
for applications at >200 °C, insufficient number of materials
are available to offer high energy density. In this context, we have
used the (NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)) nanocomposite
system consisting of NiFe2O4 (high dielectric
material) and poly(1,6-heptadiynes) (conducting polymer), where the
thermal stability of NiFe2O4 was around >250
°C and the thermal stability of poly(1,6-heptadiynes) was around
∼180 °C.71−73 The power loss of a capacitor can be computed with
the aid of mathematical relation Ploss = ω*C*VRMS2 tan δ.10 The
computed Ploss values for a NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)
nanocomposite are reported in Table 5. The quantified results suggest that the nanocomposite
capacitor Ploss is low (×102 order at 1 kHz) compared to that of the NiFe2O4 capacitor; furthermore, this nanocomposite probably demonstrates
low heat generation in comparison to the commercially available electrolytic
capacitors; hence, the thermal threatening in miniaturized electronics
could be reduced with this nanocomposite usage.

Fabrication
and Demonstration of a Capacitor for Electrical
and Electronic Applications
According to ASTM-D150, we have
fabricated pellets via the pellet-pressing technique and enabled Atlas
hydraulic pellet press. NiFe2O4 are composited
with poly(1,6-heptadiynes) under an agitate mortar with the mass ratio
of 1:20 (poly(1,6-heptadiynes)/NiFe2O4). The
composite was prepared under implemented vacuum conditions to avoid
moisture absorption; then, 0.6 g of composite was transferred to the
pelletizer and pressed in a ⌀10 mm high-end evacuated die (Atlas:
GS03100) by applying 15 tons load for 30 s, which produces a 0.6 g
of circular pellet (thickness 1.5 mm) (Figure 1). Aluminum electrode plates were provided
to two parallel sides of a pellet. One side of the electrode plate
is indicated as positive electrode, and the other side is indicated
as negative electrode. Then, the validation of prepared nanocomposite
capacitor for practical applications has been demonstrated (Video, Supporting Information). First, AC–DC
(300 mA output current) adapter was used to supply DC voltage to the
composite capacitor by connecting the positive and negative terminals
of the adapter to the parallel-plate capacitor terminals. Then, the
nanocomposite capacitor is fully charged (Video, Supporting Information); subsequently, this was connected
to the light-emitting diode (LED) (minimum operating voltage, 1.5
V). In accordance with the closed-loop circuit model, the charged
voltage of a capacitor was discharged through the LED by light illumination.
The charging and discharging capacity was correlated with the commercially
available electrolytic capacitor; it charges and discharges quickly
similar to a nanocomposite capacitor, but it stores lower potential
energy compared to the nanocomposite capacitor, which is probably
due to the high equivalent series resistance (ESR).10,63 The stored energy of a nanocomposite was due to the higher dielectric
constant, lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) attributed due
to the conducting properties of poly(1,6-heptadiynes), and improved
dissipation factor and quality factor (Figure 9).10,63 Further, this consequence
can be elucidated with the help of τ = RC time
constant, where the “τ” time constant value can
be balanced by altering the internal resistance/equivalent series
resistance (ESR) or capacitance value (minimum internal resistance-induced
conducting poly(1,6-heptadiynes) show incremental storage capacitance;
this quantity should be in symmetry with the RC time
constant).63,67 Also, the dimension of the pellet
is around 10 mm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness, which is 13 times smaller
than the reported Al and Ta electrolytic capacitor. The pellet has
a density of 5.2 g/cc3, which is 1/3 to 1/2 of the specific
gravity of the tantalum metal density. Moreover, the higher-frequency
stability (102–107 Hz), oxidation stability,
and temperature stability of a nanocomposite (∼200 °C)
probably lead to minimized parasitic effects and better reliability,
and less component attachment rendered efficient performance of a
capacitor for electrical and electronic applications.71−73 The advantages of the nanocomposite capacitor over the commercially
available electrolytic capacitor are illustrated in Table 6.

Conclusions
In
the present study, we have synthesized intrinsically conductive
poly(1,6-heptadiynes) via cyclopolymerization (CP) technique, and
further poly(1,6-heptadiynes) was composited with NiFe2O4. Two-probe measurement was utilized to reveal I–V characteristics of synthesized
poly(1,6-heptadiynes). The results suggest that the conductivity was
in the range of 1.2 × 10–5–3.1 ×
10–5 S/cm. NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/poly(1,6-heptadiynes)pellets were fabricated
by utilizing hydraulic pelletizer. Electrical measurements of the
fabricated pellets were performed with the aid of broad-band impedance
spectroscopy. The attained dielectric permittivity ε = 45 (100
Hz to 10 kHz) was attributed to the NiFe2O4 phase
as well as poly(1,6-heptadiynes). The nanocomposite dissipation factor
(DF) reduced (DF = 0.0032) due to the intrinsic conducting properties
of conjugated poly(1,6-heptadiynes) embedded in the nanocomposite.
Further, this reveals that the reduced equivalent series resistance
(ESR) (72 times) was observed from the impedance characteristics of
a nanocomposite. Moreover, improved Q-factor was
observed, which was about 310 at 1 kHz. Also, the nanocomposite RC constant was calculated, which was about 0.29 μs
at 1 kHz. Subsequently, the nanocomposite-enabled capacitor gravimetric
energy density and power density were about 0.00575 mJ/g and 9.91
W/g, respectively. Furthermore, the improved thermal threatening Ploss of the nanocomposite capacitor was about Ploss = 8.9 × 10–6. All
of the results of a nanocomposite-enabled capacitor were compared
with the commercially available configuration of tantalum hybrid capacitors,
Al and Ta electrolytic capacitors, including carbon electrochemical
capacitors. These results suggest that the nanocomposite could be
a possible candidate for electrical and electronic applications.
