A current challenge
in materials science and biotechnology is to
express a specific and controlled functionality on the large interfacial
area of a nanostructured material to create smart biohybrid systems
for targeted applications. Here, we report on a biohybrid system featuring
poly(vinyl alcohol) as the supporting synthetic polymer and bovine
serum albumin as the biofunctional element. The optimal processing
conditions to produce these self-standing composite membranes are
determined, and the composition and distribution of the bioactive
agent within the polymeric matrices are analyzed. A post-processing
cross-linking using glutaraldehyde enables this functional membrane
to be used as a chemical filter in aqueous environments. By demonstrating
that our mats can remove large amounts of ketoprofen from water, we
show that the combination of a BSA-induced biofunctionality with a
nanostructured fibrous material allows for the development of an efficient
biohybrid filtering device for the large and widely used family of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The crystal structure
of the complex between BSA and ketoprofen is determined for the first
time and confirms the interaction between the two species.

==== Body
Introduction
Filtration can be applied
to capture airborne and waterborne contaminants
such as chemical pollutants, allergens, and biological agents, and
therefore, it plays an essential role in a wide range of human activities
(e.g., water sanitation, food-chain control, health care, pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries, and others). Although extremely efficient
under normal operation conditions, traditional filters based on sieving
may prove ineffective in the separation of specific chemical contaminants,
for which affinity-based filtration may be more efficient.

Among
all of the different available techniques to produce yarns,
electrospinning has gained great interest within the nanotechnology
community for its ability to overcome challenges that are associated
with the production of nanostructured filters.1 Electrospun nanofibrous mats are good candidates as filtering media
due to their lightness, high permeability, and small and interconnected
pores.2 The reduced porosity, together
with the small fiber size, generates a slip flow regime, thus increasing
the efficiency and providing a higher-resolution separation with respect
to micromembranes.3,4

Although nanofibrous mats
do not possess enough mechanical strength
to withstand impingement or high flux during filtration, they can
be processed as an active nanostructured filtering layer on top of
a traditional filter.5 Their large specific
surface area enables remarkable surface modification or the incorporation
of active chemicals and functionalities at the nanoscale. Post-processing
allows the addition of specific functionalities to a raw electrospun
membrane or the removal/modification of the chemical structure of
an electrospun polymer. Various post-electrospinning processes have
been reported, depending on the composition of the mat and on the
desired specific functionalities. They range from thermal or plasma
surface treatments to physical vapor deposition, cross-linking, hydrolysis,
oxidation, grafting, and acid treatments.6,7 All
of these treatments act almost exclusively on the fiber surface, without
affecting the bulk. However, this general approach entails considerable
challenges, related to uniformity. In fact, post-modification can
be inhomogeneous through the entire thickness of the electrospun mat.
Moreover, fiber coating has to be uniform and ultrathin so as to not
affect the pore size.

To overcome these issues, selected functionalities
can be introduced
directly during the electrospinning process by adding small molecules,
oligomers, or even a second polymer to the feed solution. For this
approach to work, the intrinsic affinity between the different components
must be taken into consideration, for example, the solubility of the
additive in the solvent of choice. In the case of biomolecules, particularly
mild processing conditions are usually necessary to ensure the retention
of both their biological activity and their native conformation. This
direct functionalization usually leads to a uniform distribution of
the additive within the fiber. Nevertheless, the preferential localization
of the additive into specific fiber sites such as beads can also occur.8,9

To date, existing microporous membranes have been surface-modified
to expose affinity ligands that interact with specific biomolecules,
and they are widely used for affinity purification technologies.10 Amino acids, antigens, antibodies, dyes, and
metal-affinity ligands have been immobilized onto sheets and fiber
matrices, which have been successfully exploited for targeted separations.
However, post-functionalization is often characterized by low yield
and slow kinetics. For instance, the immobilization of a polysaccharide
such as heparin onto an epoxy membrane to capture its complementary
proteins requires a slow (8 days) membrane functionalization reaction.11

In biofunctionalized electrospun systems,
the nanostructured scaffold
with tridimensional porosity has been loaded with the biological component,
leading to a decoration with a selected functionality onto the high
surface area. Several biological components have been considered,
ranging from proteins to enzymes,12−14 where an increased enzymatic
activity was often reported once enzymes are immobilized in electrospun
fibers,1 DNA strands,15 yeast,16 and cells.17

Following this approach, we report on
a biohybrid electrospun filtering
medium composed of a biocompatible polymer (poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA))
and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the biofunctional element. We show
that the electrospinning conditions and the following cross-linking
of the mat with glutaraldehyde (GA) impart water stability to the
membrane without compromising the fibrous morphology of the tissue.
Indeed, the physiological ability of BSA to bind and sequester many
drugs, including most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
in the blood plasma is retained also when the protein is embedded
into polymer nanofibers, and we demonstrate that this biohybrid membrane
is an efficient system to filter an NSAID such as ketoprofen (KPF)
from aqueous solutions. Owing to their analgesic and antipyretic properties,
NSAIDs are widely prescribed to relieve pain and to reduce inflammation.
As a result of their huge worldwide consumption and their metabolic
profile, NSAIDs represent an increasingly important source of pollution
of surface and underground waters.18,19 KPF is one
of the most representative and widely used NSAIDs and it has been
found in waste waters at concentrations as high as 2–10 μg/L20 up to 2 mg/L in the case of effluents of pharmaceutical
production facilities.21 Therefore, it
is considered as an important source of contamination of soil and
ground water22 as it is particularly hazardous
for water organisms.23 Unfortunately, the
conventional wastewater treatment plants are not sufficiently effective
to remove NSAID residues and additional water treatments are necessary.24 Therefore, efforts in developing tools and techniques
to achieve a better removal of these pollutants from water can have
an important environmental and socioeconomic impact.

To provide
structural evidence of the direct interaction between
BSA and ketoprofen and validate our BSA-loaded fibers as reliable
chemical filtration tools for ketoprofen-contaminated waste waters,
we set out to solve the X-ray crystal structure of the complex.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
A lyophilized powder of bovine serum albumin
≥96% (BSA), poly(vinyl alcohol) >99% hydrolyzed (PVA), all
buffer components, glutaraldehyde aqueous solution 50% (GA), hydrochloric
acid min. 37% (HCl), and acetone ≥99.5% were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich. Ketoprofen was purchased from Fluorochem and Coomassie
brilliant blue G-250 from BioRad. The Thermo Scientific Pierce Coomassie
Plus (Bradford) Protein Assay Kit was used during the Bradford protein
assay. All chemicals and solvents were used as received. Crystallization
plates were bought from Hampton Research (Aliso Vejo, CA).

Preparation
of the Fully Hydrolyzed PVA Solution
A
weighted amount of fully hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA (Mw = 89 000–98 000 Da) was
slowly added into distilled water, and the polymer was allowed to
dissolve under moderate stirring. The solution was stirred at 95 °C
for 1 h and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. This led
to a clear PVA solution without precipitates.

Preparation of BSA Solutions
and PVA/BSA Blends
The
aqueous BSA/PVA feed solution could not be directly prepared since
bovine serum albumin undergoes irreversible denaturation at temperatures
higher than 50 °C. Therefore, the two components were separately
dissolved in distilled water (see the previous section for PVA solution
preparation). The two freshly prepared samples were then mixed in
well-defined proportions to obtain the final BSA/PVA blended solution,
which was stirred for 1 h prior to electrospinning.

Preparation
of Biohybrid Membranes
Electrospinning
was performed by loading the freshly prepared feed solution in a 2.5
mL syringe with a 22 gauge needle (Hamilton Gastight model 1002 TLL),
which was then placed on an infusion pump (KDS Scientific, model series
200) that provided a solution rate in the range of 0.05–0.4
mL/h. Electrospinning was carried out using a bottom–up vertical
setup, with a tip-collector distance in the range of 12–30
cm. Voltage was applied to the needle by a high-voltage power supply
(Spellman SL30P300) in the range of 12–24 kV. Electrospinning
was performed onto either glass slides for optical characterization
or silicon substrates for scanning electron microscopy characterization.
Self-standing membranes were obtained with approximately 15 min of
deposition onto glass slides and by subsequent peeling off. Samples
were stored at 4 °C until use.

Chemical Cross-Linking
of Electrospun Mats
Electrospun
mats of PVA and the PVA/BSA blend were removed from the collector
and immersed in a 0.15 M acetone glutaraldehyde aqueous solution bath
with 0.05 M HCl.25 The bath comprised 1.5
mL of a 50% GA aqueous solution, 2.5 mL of a 1 M HCl stock solution,
and 46 mL of acetone. The solution was kept under stirring for 1 h.
Mats were gently taken out from the bath and rinsed in a clean bath
to remove the excess of cross-linking solution.

Characterization
Optical images were obtained with
an Olympus microscope with the use of an INFINITY microscope camera.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with JEOL scanning
electron microscope model JSM-6010LV, applying a potential of 5–8
kV. Fibers were deposited directly onto a silicon substrate, and no
further metallization was needed. Image analysis was performed with
ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2016).

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Philips CM 200 field-emission
gun microscope. Fibers were deposited directly onto lacey carbon-coated
copper grids and examined at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. During
the acquisition of TEM images, the samples did not undergo structural
transformation. Low-beam current densities and short acquisition times
were adopted.

Infrared spectra were recorded in the transmission
mode using a
Nicolet 6700 FTIR interferometer on freestanding membranes. The resolution
was 2 cm–1, and 256 sample scans were acquired.
The Omnic 7.1 software (Thermo Nicolet Instrumentation) was used to
analyze the spectra. Spectra of pure BSA were obtained by depositing
a few drops of a water–protein solution onto a zinc selenide
substrate and analyzing after gentle solvent evaporation.

Bradford
protein assays were performed using a Beckman Coulter
DU730 Life Science UV–vis spectrophotometer, in semi-micro-cuvettes
in PMMA. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian
Cary 5000 spectrophotometer.

Bradford Assay for Protein Quantification
The amount
of protein in the mat, both as-spun and after water immersion, was
measured by the Bradford protein assay using Coomassie brilliant blue
(CBB) G-250 and BSA as the reference protein. For a direct test, the
absorbance at 595 nm of the dye solution, which is proportional to
the amount of protein in solution, was measured. A standard curve
of a known concentration of BSA in water was prepared and used as
calibration for the measure of the samples. Specifically, BSA solutions
of known concentrations were prepared in water; 250 μL of such
solutions were mixed with 1.25 mL of CBB, left for 5 min, and subsequently
probed at 595 nm in a spectrophotometer using CBB as the baseline.

The colorimetric assay was used (i) to quantify the BSA content
present in the mat before cross-linking (loading test) and (ii) to
evaluate the leaking of BSA from a cross-linked mat by immersion in
water (leaking test). Regarding the loading test, a membrane of known
mass was dissolved in water, and then the solution was probed for
its BSA content using the standard curve as reference. For the leaking
test, the cross-linked and water-insoluble mats were immersed in water
for 1 h. After extracting the mat from the bath, the amount of released
protein was determined by measuring the residual protein that was
present in water. Measurements were carried out in triplicate, and
mats of pure PVA were used as controls for both experiments.

Ketoprofen–Water
Solution Filtration
Electrospun
mats of cross-linked PVA or the PVA/BSA blend were used for water
filtration tests. UV–vis absorption spectra of a ketoprofen–water
solution at a known concentration (26 μM) were recorded before
and after flowing the solution under gravity through the electrospun
membrane. A weighted membrane was mounted on a filtering module attached
with a luer lock connector to a glass syringe of 10 mL. The filtering
module consisted of a metallic holder, where the self-standing electrospun
mat was mounted, and a Teflon o-ring for the watertight seal. The
UV–vis spectra of the filtered solution were recorded to calculate
the residual concentration of ketoprofen. The amount of material filtered
was retrieved and normalized based on the mat weight.

Preparation
and Crystallization of the Bovine Serum Albumin
Complex with Ketoprofen
Prior to crystallization, the protein
was prepared as previously described.26 BSA was dissolved in a buffer composed of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5,
and 150 mM NaCl (buffer A) and then purified with a single gel-filtration
step on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300GL size-exclusion chromatography
column pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The eluted protein was
concentrated to 10 mg/mL using an Amicon-15 filter with a 10 000
MWCO. The BSA–ketoprofen complex was co-crystallized according
to the procedure described for the bovine serum albumin complex with
naproxen.27 A 10-fold molar excess of ketoprofen
(1.5 mM solution in ethanol) was added to a 10 mg/mL solution of purified
BSA in buffer A, and the mixture was incubated at 18 °C for 2
h. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the vapor-diffusion
method at room temperature and using crystallization conditions similar
to those of the BSA apo structure.26 Prior
to X-ray data collection, crystals were frozen in a chemically identical
solution supplemented with 1.5 mM ketoprofen and 25% (v/v) PEG 400
for cryoprotection. Data up to 2.80 Å resolution were collected
at the X06DA-PXIII beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer
Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). Diffraction images were processed
using XDS.28 The structure was determined
by molecular replacement using PHASER29 from the PHENIX suite30 and the apo structure
of BSA (PDB ID: 4OR0) as the search probe. Refinement was carried out using PHENIX,30 whereas Coot31 was
used for manual rebuilding. The program PROCHECK32 was used to assess the stereochemistry of the structure.
Data collection and final refinement statistics are given in Table S1. All of the figures in the paper were
generated using PyMOL.33

The final
crystallographic coordinates of the crystal structure shown here are
available in the RCSB (PDB accession code: 6QS9).

Results and Discussion
As the surface-affinity ligand for drug removal from waste water,
bovine serum albumin (BSA) was chosen. BSA is one of the most abundant
plasma proteins contributing to the circulatory system, accounting
for over 60% of the total protein content in the blood.34 Although several specialized transport proteins
are known to be present in the plasma, serum albumin is highly promiscuous
in binding and transporting several different species, such as fatty
acids, which are driven to the heart and skeletal muscles and converted
into energy. BSA is also known to bind to a wide selection of drugs
and other bioactive molecules and promote their transport within the
blood stream.34

Biomolecules alone
are rather challenging to electrospin as they
lack the suitable viscoelasticity, a fundamental property that is
required for the stabilization of the spun jet.35,36 Previous studies have shown that BSA aqueous solutions cannot generate
fibers at any input voltage for electrospinning.37 Only denatured protein solutions have afforded nanofibers
made entirely of BSA.35,38

To overcome this limitation,
BSA can be blended with hydrophilic
synthetic polymers such as polyethylene oxide37 and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).39,40 Alternatively,
an emulsion of a biocompatible synthetic polymer such as polycaprolactone
supplemented with surfactants can also undergo electrospinning.41 Following this approach, it has been shown that
electrospinning does not cause any significant changes, damages, or
unfolding to the conformation of BSA.37

As the wettability of filtering media plays a significant
role,
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was chosen as the structural polymer for
the biohybrid membrane, since it combines good mechanical properties
with excellent hydrophilicity.42 PVA fiber
formation is strongly influenced by a number of electrospinning parameters,
ranging from the solution properties to the presence of additives
or the setup and environmental conditions.43,44 Although the addition of strong bases such as NaOH is known to help
fiber formation of fully hydrolyzed PVA,45 electrospinning of the polymer in distilled water without any additive
may help reduce the risk of structural or chemical BSA modifications.
By electrospinning aqueous PVA solutions at different polymer concentrations,
we collected fibers at <18 wt % PVA, whereas we observed the formation
of an unprocessable gel when 18 wt % PVA is reached. The characteristic
features of the collected mats under different processing conditions
are reported in Table 1.

Table 1 Electrospinning Conditions and Fiber
Morphology for PVA and the Blend PVA/BSA

and very few beaded fibers	
14 wt % PVA	15–18	0.05–0.2	25–28	homogeneous and defect-free fibers	
15 wt % PVA	15–19	0.1–0.3	12–18	homogeneous and defect-free fibers	
16 wt % PVA	15–17	0.2	13–18	few defect-free fibers; low production yield

13 wt % PVA (10–100)% BSA	17–19	0.3	18	homogeneous and defect-free fibers	
14 wt % PVA (10–100)% BSA	17–19	0.3	18	homogeneous
and defect-free fibers	
We found that the critical
PVA concentration to obtain defect-free
and highly homogeneous fibers is ≥14 wt % (Figure 1a) and that the fiber diameter
increases with increasing polymer concentration in the electrospinning
solution. We did not measure the diameter of the beaded fibers that
resulted from electrospinning 10 wt % PVA solutions since these extremely
heterogeneous samples did not allow the calculation of a reliable
average diameter (see Figure S1). The addition
of BSA to the feed solution did not have any negative effect on the
electrospinning process, as smooth and flawless fibers were obtained
under all of the tested conditions (Figure 1b). It is worth noting that a remarkable
reduction of the fiber diameter was observed when even a low amount
of BSA (10%) was added (Figure 1c). This can be explained by considering that the isoelectric
point of BSA is about 4.7 at 25 °C, meaning that BSA carries
a net negative charge when added to a neutral solution.38 Therefore, the effect of BSA on the electrospinning
solution is comparable to the addition of salts, which causes an increase
in the conductivity and a decrease in the fiber diameter due to the
stronger elongational forces acting on the polymer jet.40,46

(a) 14 wt % PVA (scale bar 10 μm), (b) PVA/BSA (14 wt % PVA–10%
BSA) (scale bar 10 μm), and (c) average fiber diameter (mean
obtained over n = 100 measurements) measured for
the PVA fiber (black dots) and the PVA loaded with 10 wt % BSA (orange
squares). (d) PVA/BSA self-standing electrospun membrane (12 wt %
PVA–10% BSA) as removed from the collector after electrospinning
(scale bar 1 cm).

The biohybrid sample
composition of 12 wt % PVA and 10% BSA was
chosen as the reference for all of the following tests due to the
uniformity and the small diameter of the fibers thus obtained (137
± 26 nm), which provides a large functional surface area to the
environment. Self-standing mats were obtained by depositing the fibers
onto a static collector, located at ca. 18 cm from the needle tip,
for about 15 min (Figure 1d).

According to the literature,47 we used
FTIR spectroscopy to analyze the BSA conformation in the electrospun
tissue. When we compared the FTIR spectra of the electrospun samples
of pure PVA and of the PVA–BSA blend, the characteristic vibrational
modes of BSA were clearly visible in the biohybrid system (Figure S5). BSA has two characteristic vibrational
modes at 1541–1550 and 1651–1660 cm–1, which can be assigned to amide I (ν C=O) and amide
II (δ N-H) bands, respectively, and do not overlap with the
PVA spectra. When BSA is blended with PVA, no shift of either the
PVA or the BSA fingerprint bands is observed, which indicates that
no protein conformational change has been induced by either an interaction
between the two components of the blend or by the electrospinning
process itself. This indicates that PVA and the reported electrospinning
conditions are suitable for the fabrication of the biohybrid composite
membrane. However, for the membrane to be used for water filtration,
cross-linking is required to prevent the mat from dissolving in water
during operation. Cross-linking was achieved by immersion of the as-spun
membrane in a bath of glutaraldehyde (GA) in acetone. GA was chosen
as the cross-linking agent for PVA since it is known to be more effective
than other chemicals such as formaldehyde or glycidyl acrylate.48 Moreover, it limits swelling of the matrix,
which is a significant drawback of physical post-electrospinning processing
methods such as heating-induced increased crystallinity.42 Acetone is a poor solvent for both PVA49 and BSA,50 whereas
a small HCl content, which catalyzes the cross-linking reaction, is
not hazardous for the protein. SEM micrographs of the as-spun sample,
the sample obtained after cross-linking treatment, and after water
immersion of the cross-linked membranes are reported in Figure 2a–c. The cross-linking
treatment turned out to be fully effective; indeed, after the process,
the fibrous morphology was completely maintained and no change in
the fiber diameter was observed.

with glutaraldehyde. (a)

5 μm). (b) SEM micrograph of the sample after cross-linking
with GA. The sample was immersed into an acetone bath containing 0.15
M glutaraldehyde and 0.05 M HCl for 1 h and gently dried (bar = 5
μm). (c) SEM micrograph of the cross-linked mat after overnight
immersion in water and gentle drying (bar = 5 μm). (d) FTIR

with GA. (e) FTIR of a mat of PVA 12 wt %–BSA 10% before (purple
line) and after (red line) cross-linking with GA. Relevant vibrational
modes are highlighted for PVA and PVA/BSA, before and after cross-linking.

The effect of PVA cross-linking
with GA is clearly evidenced by
FTIR spectroscopy, which shows a decrease in the ν(-OH) band
at 3315–3387 cm–1 and the appearance of a
new, intense band in the 1150–1085 cm–1 region,
corresponding to the C–O–C stretching mode of the bonds
of the acetal family formed by GA with the -OH groups of PVA (Figure 2d). New bands are
also present in the 1720–1740 and the 2830–2695 cm–1 regions, which are related to the C=O and
C–H stretching, respectively. These signals are consistent
with the reaction of only one aldehyde of the cross-linker with an
-OH group of PVA, which leads to a residual aldehyde signal, as described
previously in the literature.51,52

Similar bands
are also visible after cross-linking of the biohybrid
PVA–BSA system (Figure 2e). It is worth noting that the vibrational bands of amide
I and amide II of BSA are not modified after the cross-linking process,
thus indicating that the cross-linking does not affect the BSA structure.
However, GA forms covalent bonds with both the hydroxyl groups of
the PVA chains and with the BSA amine groups exposed on the fiber
surface. Although the former reaction is predominant, cross-linking
with glutaraldehyde can involve both biohybrid system components and
stabilizes the protein within the polymeric matrix. Analogous situations
have been previously reported for other proteins and enzymes.40,53,54

The Bradford assay55 was used for BSA
quantification in the fibrous mat (loading test) and as a direct quantification
of the possible BSA release when the membrane is used in aqueous media
(leaking test).54,56,57 It is known that, although they are often added to the feed solution
to successfully electrospin PVA, the presence of surfactants interferes
with the readout of the Bradford test, leading to misrepresented data.
Hence, no additives were used in our membranes.

Calibration
curves (Figure S7) for the
direct Bradford assay were used for the quantification of the amount
of BSA that was present in solution or in the mat. Bradford tests
allowed the measurement of (i) the amount of BSA in the as-spun biohybrid
matrix dissolved in water (loading test) and (ii) the amount of protein
released by a cross-linked membrane (leaking test). Results are reported
in Table 2.

Table 2 Quantification of BSA in Water-Soluble
Mats (Loading Test) and of the Protein Released from Cross-Linked
Mats (Leaking Tests) by the Bradford Assay

control PVA mat	0	0.0 ± 0.1	
PVA–BSA mat	10	0.2 ± 0.2	
For the loading test, PVA/BSA membranes of a known mass were dissolved
in a known volume of water, which was then probed with the Bradford
assay. A BSA concentration of 9.5 ± 0.2% was determined, which
is in good agreement with the nominal concentration of BSA in the
electrospinning solution (10%). Therefore, the nominal concentration
of the protein in the electrospinning solution is maintained in the
final membrane sample. This protein content is preserved also after
the cross-linking process, as no significant amount of protein released
by a cross-linked sample was measured by the leaking test. For a cross-linked
mat with a nominal BSA concentration of 10%, the protein released
after 1 h of dipping in water is as low as 0.21 ± 0.2% and increases
to just 1.17 ± 0.6% for a 30% BSA mat. The absence of BSA release
was also confirmed by FTIR analysis of the cross-linking bath; indeed,
no BSA fingerprint could be observed, also suggesting that no significant
leaking of the protein occurs during the cross-linking process (Figure S6). Therefore, we can conclude that the
concentration of BSA that is found in the final cross-linked mat is
the same as the nominal concentration of BSA in the electrospinning
solution.

Although the PVA fiber surface is decorated with BSA,
as clearly
shown by the blue coloration assumed by the biohybrid cross-linked
membrane when it is immersed in a CBB solution (Figure S8), the protein does not segregate at the fiber surface
during the electrospinning process, but it is uniformly dispersed
in the whole polymer material. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of the electrospun fibers with different BSA contents
show constant contrast along the fibers, without any core–sheath
structure58,59 with BSA segregated in an outer layer (Figure 3).

of electrospun biohybrid fibers with
12 wt % PVA and different amounts of BSA (PVA:BSA ratios of 10:0,
10:1, 10:3, 10:5, 10:7, and 10:10).

Biohybrid PVA–BSA membranes were used for the chemical
filtration
of an aqueous ketoprofen solution. Electrospun membranes were produced
with 12 wt % PVA–10% BSA loading, cross-linked, dried, and
weighted for the quantification of the total protein content. Membranes
were placed in a filtering syringe module, which was mounted onto
the syringe tip and kept fixed via a Teflon ring (Figure 4).

ketoprofen from water with a biohybrid PVA–BSA
membrane. (a) Electrospun membrane is placed in a filter module and
then mounted on the syringe tip with a Luer Lock connection. (b) Chemical
structure of ketoprofen used as the target in the filtration experiments.
(c) Normalized quantities of ketoprofen filtered from a solution of
26 μM concentration with respect to the weight of the membrane
are zero for the pure PVA membrane and 550 ± 100 μg/g for
the 12 wt % PVA–10% BSA biohybrid membrane.

The amount of ketoprofen removed from the water
by the membrane
was measured by comparing the UV–vis absorption spectra of
the solution before and after filtration (Figure S10). The molar extinction coefficient of ketoprofen in water
was previously calculated to determine the concentration of the drug
in solution from the absorption spectra (Figure S9).

The ratio of the mass of drug to the mass of membrane
is calculated
as an indication of the ability of the biohybrid filter to bind ketoprofen
in solution. The mass of the drug filtered was divided by the mat
weight, and it was found that the biohybrid membrane was able to filter
a mass of 550 ± 100 μg of ketoprofen per gram of membrane.
To demonstrate that the filtration of ketoprofen occurs via the interaction
of the drug with the protein and is not due to physical filtration
by a sieving mechanism, a PVA cross-linked membrane without BSA was
also tested. No significant change in the concentration of ketoprofen
before and after filtration was detected, indicating that no sieving
occurs.

In the literature, there are a number of studies involving
BSA
as a model biomolecule to study drug–protein interactions.
To this end, particularly relevant are the availability of structural
data26,27,60,61 and the fact that BSA shows 80% homology with human
serum albumin34 (HSA). Ketoprofen has been
shown to interact with BSA and to bind to the protein without affecting
its overall architecture.62,63 However, the crystal
structure of the ketoprofen–BSA complex has so far been elusive,
whereas BSA has been successfully co-crystallized with naproxen,27 which also belongs to the class of NSAIDs.

In this work, the crystal structure of the BSA–ketoprofen
complex was solved, and the structure shown herein provides clear
evidence of the direct interaction between BSA and ketoprofen and
the formation of a stable complex.

The BSA–ketoprofen
complex crystallized in the monoclinic
C2 space group with the unit cell parameters a =
212.49 Å, b = 44.37 Å, c = 142.71 Å, and β = 113.24°. As with all of the
other BSA structures described in the literature,26,60,64 the crystal contains two molecules in the
asymmetric unit. No significant variations are observed when the structure
is compared to other BSA crystal structures (RMSD = 0.531 Å to 4OR0 chain A, Figure 5A), with the overall
fold characterized by a heart-shaped molecule composed of three structurally
similar helical domains.26 In this structure,
one ketoprofen molecule occupies the drug site 1, which is located
in the subdomain IIA of BSA, similar to naproxen27 or 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid.60 The carboxyl group of ketoprofen forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl
group of Tyr149, the imidazole nitrogen atoms of His241, and the guanidine
moiety of Arg256 (Figure 5B). Overall, the ligand is embedded in a mostly hydrophobic
pocket lined by one tryptophan (Trp213), four leucines (Leu218, Leu233,
Leu237, and Leu259), two isoleucines (Ile263 and Ile289), two alanines
(Ala260 and Ala290), and one phenylalanine (Phe222).

Conclusions
We demonstrated that
a biohybrid electrospun membrane consisting
of BSA-loaded PVA fibers effectively removes ketoprofen from an aqueous
solution by chemical filtration. This biohybrid filter was obtained
by electrospinning, in a one-step procedure, a feed solution containing
both the polymer and the protein. Control over the spinning parameters
led to homogeneous and defect-free fibers as thin as 137 ± 26
nm with a uniform distribution of the protein in the fiber section.
Cross-linking with glutaraldehyde made fibers insoluble, thus enabling
the use of these membranes for filtering aqueous solutions. Neither
the electrospinning process nor the cross-linking reaction caused
any modification to the protein structure, as shown by the unvaried
characteristic amide I and amide II FTIR bands of the protein during
all of the fabrication steps. The colorimetric Bradford protein assay
allowed the quantification of BSA loaded in the membrane, which matched
the nominal protein concentration of the electrospinning solution,
thus demonstrating that no BSA leakage occurs during either the cross-linking
reaction or the filtration step.

The fibrous membrane decorated
with properly folded BSA, uniformly
distributed in the fiber, was designed and exploited to interact with
ketoprofen, which is a relevant and widespread pollutant in waste
water. The filtration test was successful due to the specific chemical
interaction between the protein and the target drug. In fact, the
crystalline structure of the BSA–ketoprofen complex, which
was solved for the first time, clearly indicates that the drug forms
a strong interaction in a well-described binging site for the protein,
named drug site number 1.

The affordability of the raw materials,
the control over the processing
conditions, and the facile industrial scalability of the process allows
for the integration of this biohybrid system in macroscale devices,
which is a crucial step for any chemical filtration application. Moreover,
these experiments provide a conceptual framework and an experimental
platform for follow-up experiments in different technological settings,
ranging from biosensing to probes, and target immobilization for biotechnology,
nanomaterial self-assembly, and environmental applications.
