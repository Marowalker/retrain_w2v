The incorporation of poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate)
(PHBV) as a partial biobased polymer
substitute for polypropylene (PP) was investigated. The ternary blends
were prepared through melt compounding extrusion followed by injection
molding techniques with a constant biopolymer ratio of 30 wt %. Further
addition of pyrolyzed miscanthus-based carbon was carried out to establish
a contrast between talc-filled PP. When the morphology of the biopolymer
minor phase was analyzed theoretically using contact angle for interfacial
tension and spreading coefficient values along with solubility parameter
calculations and via scanning electron microscopy imaging, the core–shell
architecture was found with the PHBV encasing the PLA phase. Mechanical
testing of the materials showed that only the tensile properties were
reduced for all samples, whereas the impact strength was increased
above the neat PP. With inclusion of the biobased carbon filler into
the blend system, the thermomechanical properties were elevated above
that of the PP matrix. The final properties of the multiphase polymeric
composites are found to be related to the morphology obtained and
inherent properties of the individual constituents.

==== Body
Introduction
The use of polypropylene (PP) varies widely
and can be found in
commodity areas like the packaging sector all the way up to engineering
applications such as automotive parts. The downside to this plastic,
like most others used today, is the disposal issues of such products
that end up in landfills or as litter and do not decompose or are
incinerated for energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
These current waste options are causing environmental concerns, health
hazards, social scrutiny, and economic burdens. To manage the end
life of polyolefins and to diminish the negative aspects of plastic
waste, there has been an aim to develop biomaterial counterparts.

The use of biodegradable and biobased polymers as a partial component
in PP blends can help minimize the impact of discarded products.1 Generally, by blending these types of materials
together, the biopolymer properties can be maintained, as they are
less prone to degradation during the life span of the product, while
also enabling gradual decomposition of the polyolefin through biodisintegration
when the material has been discarded.2 Both
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) have been tested separately in PP blends
for these reasons. However, the inclusion of PLA in PP results in
poor mechanical strength as there is little compatibility between
the polar PLA and nonpolar PP.3 Similarly,
PHBV tends to have a minimal effect on the strength of PP because
of the poor miscibility of these two polymers.4 Yet, the processing of immiscible polymers in various blends and
composites is used as a method to provide a combination of properties
that the singular polymers are not able to attain on their own. These
multicomponent blends tend to allow for trade-offs in areas such as
price, biocontent, balanced property performance, and compostability
or recyclability at the end life of the product. Therefore, the polymer
ratio in blends can be adjusted to meet specific cost-performance
criteria. It is common with these unequal ratios of polymers that
the final morphology of the blend will have a minor phase that forms
either spheres, elongated ovals, or thin sheet/platelet structures
within the major matrix phase.5 Depending
on the interfacial tension, viscosity, and elasticity of the polymers
being blended as well as the immiscible blend ratio, history, and
processing parameters used, differing morphologies can result.6

Other methods to enhance the mechanical
properties of these poorly
compatible blends are through fillers. Talc is one such filler that
is added to polymeric systems for increasing their stiffness and thermal
properties. However, with the concept of biocontent being more prevalent
nowadays, biobased carbon particles are studied for their reinforcing
effects in composites.7 This is due to
naturally derived fillers that are readily abundant, which provide
less density, have low cost, and remain environmentally benign.8

Therefore, this research study focused
on the morphological structures
and mechanical properties of the multiphase blends and their composites
by using the good stiffness provided by PLA and the thermomechanical
stability associated with PHBV in a PP matrix along with a bioderived
carbon filler. The aim was focused on augmenting the biobased content
of the blend by improving the impact, enhancing the thermal utilization
range, minimizing the mechanical performance loss, and providing a
less dense filler. The base characteristics of PP were first tested
along with the addition of 10 wt % fillers of talc and a biobased
carbon separately. A second set of samples of PP with different blend
ratios of PLA and PHBV were included at 30 wt % biopolymer additions
to analyze the variation in performance of the tertiary blend system
while increasing the biobased content of the blend. In the final set
of materials, the same fillers were then incorporated into the blend
with the optimum overall performance to compare with the base PP composites.

Results
and Discussion
Contact Angle Analysis
The contact
angles for the three
polymers used in this investigation were measured with both polar
and nonpolar solvents, water and diiodomethane, respectively, as seen
in Table 1. The values
obtained with water show that all the samples have a hydrophilic characteristic
in them as the contact angle is less than 90°.9 There is however a 20–25° difference observed
between PP and the two biopolymers. This greater wettability, smaller
contact angle, of PLA and PHBV demonstrate their higher surface energies
as compared to PP, with the water coating a larger area of the polymer
surface to reduce the surface energy level.10 In the case of the nonpolar solvent, PHBV had the greatest wetting
followed by PP and PLA. Only PLA showed a minor change in its contact
angle between the two liquids, whereas the contact angles of PP and
PHBV reduced as they have more nonpolar regions along the polymer
chain.

Dispersive (γd) Components for the Three Polymers

PHBV	67.46 ± (0.29)	46.34 ± (0.033)	43.93	10.81	33.12	
After conducting the
surface tension calculations, the total surface
tension for biopolymers is approximately 10 mN·m–1 higher than that of PP, as seen in Table 1. This difference is correlated with the
intermolecular attractions present in the chain structure of the polymers.
For PP chains, weak van der Waals forces provide the majority of the
polyolefins attraction between the chains, whereas the biopolymers
contain dipole regions and hydrogen bonding that creates a greater
affinity for neighboring polymer chains that increase the surface
energy of the thermoplastic.11 This is
evident when the surface tension is separated into the polar and dispersive
components, with PP having a very small polar part but a dispersive
constituent similar to the other two polymers.

Through the implementation
of the harmonic and geometric mean equations,
the lowest interfacial tension values calculated from either method
were obtained for the combination of PLA and PHBV, as shown in the
results of Table 2.
By contrast, PP and PLA showed the highest interfacial tension, demonstrating
the immiscibility of these two polymers. However, PHBV has a surface
tension similar to both PP in terms of the dispersive component and
PLA with respect to the polar component, making it more suited as
a partially miscible polymer for both materials. Therefore, PHBV works
as an intermediate compatibilizer between the two immiscible portions
of the ternary blend.

To further establish the phase morphology
of the system, the spreading
coefficient model can be used, which is utilized for three-phase systems.
This involves rewriting the generalized Harkins equation into the
alternative form tested by Hobbs et al.12 1  where
λij is the spreading coefficient
of i over j and γ is the interfacial
tension between two of
the polymers. When λij is positive, i will coat the j component, and when negative,
it will not, while only in the instance where both combinations are
negative, the minor phases will disperse separately as droplets in
the matrix or none of the polymers will form a complete layer at the
interface of the others.13 The case where
the last two options are possible is dependent on the sign of the
third spreading coefficient associated with the major phase between
both minor phases.

In this ternary blend, the tendency of PLA
to encapsulate PHBV
and vice versa was calculated for the minor phases along with the
PP matrix spreading coefficient, as seen in Table 2. The resultant values for the spreading
coefficients of λPLA/PHBV and λPHBV/PLA at 20 °C are negative and positive, respectively. This implies
that PHBV will tend to encapsulate the PLA phase inside the PP matrix.
The values for the third spreading coefficient related to the PP matrix
were negative, which refers to the nonwetting of the matrix on both
the minor phases and allows the dominant influence of PHBV to completely
wet PLA. However, to provide a more predictive model of the ternary
blend during the processing conditions, the surface tensions were
extrapolated to the melt blending temperature. This was done via the
temperature coefficient of −0.06 mN·m–1·K–1, which is commonly used in the literature.14 Upon extrapolation, the same trend was seen
in the spreading coefficient with PHBV encasing PLA at 180 °C.
This means that the morphology should not undergo any major changes
during cooling and retain its matrix–core–shell dispersed
phase structure.

Solubility Parameter Method
Upon
implementation of
the model criteria from the Hoftyzer–van Krevelen and Hoy approaches,
the total solubility parameters were summed and compared alongside
the Hildebrand and Hansen values obtained from the literature, as
displayed in Table 3. The resulting outcome of the calculated values from the Hoftyzer–van
Krevelen and Hoy methods shows that PLA and PHBV have a value similar
to one another, whereas the value of PP is lower than that of PLA
and PHBV. Because of the close solubility parameter of the two biopolymers,
there is a likelihood of good mixing between them. The magnitude of
the difference between the solubility parameters can be used to distinguish
the miscibility, with Δδ < 2 MPa1/2 having
good miscibility, and Δδ > 10 MPa1/2 being
immiscible, with partial miscibility between these regimes.15 From this, all of the differences between the
PLA and PHBV solubility parameters are less than 2 MPa1/2, making them miscible, whereas, for PP, all solubility differences
show signs of partial miscibility, with the lowest differences occurring
between PP and PHBV. This again emphasizes that PHBV is better suited
to act as an intermediate between the PLA and PP polymers in the ternary
blend with miscibility characteristics between both the components.

Mechanical Properties
The neat PP
along with the ternary
blends and composites containing biocarbon and talc was tested for
their mechanical performance. The tensile and flexural properties
including strength and modulus are displayed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
The neat PP showed a tensile strength of 43 MPa, which was greater
than all other samples tested by 5 MPa or more. The addition of the
fillers to the system caused a reduction in the strength as there
is minimal contribution of the biocarbon and talc to the polymer under
stress.

Figure 1 Tensile strength and moduli of the PP blends and composites (samples
with arithmetic means that do not share a letter are significantly
different; uppercase: tensile strength and lowercase: tensile modulus).

Figure 2 Flexural strength and moduli of the PP blends
and composites (samples
with arithmetic means that do not share a letter are significantly
different; uppercase: flexural strength and lowercase: flexural modulus).

To correlate the lack of stress
transfer between the matrix and
the filler, the Nicolais–Narkis model was tested. Assuming
the fillers are spherical, the model can predict the ratio of the
tensile strengths of the matrix and composite systems. For the situation
where there is no adhesion between the materials and the filler is
only causing a reduction in cross-sectional area, the equation is19 2  where σc and σm are the tensile
strengths of the composite and matrix, respectively,
with the filler volume fraction represented by φf. When analyzing the ratio for 10 wt % fillers to PP, the calculated
σc/σm ratio was 20, with a 13% reduction
in strength for the biocarbon and talc. However, the actual measurements
had a lower ratio with a 28% loss in strength when biocarbon was included
and 22% for talc. This discrepancy is due to the irregular shape of
the biocarbon and platelike structure of the talc, neither of which
is completely spherical. In the case of the ternary blends with fillers,
the biocarbon showed a similar loss from the measured value of 18%
to the theoretical value of 21% based on eq 2. By contrast, the talc did not undergo a
significant loss in the quaternary composite with the strength reduction
of only 4%, with the calculated value from eq 2 estimated to be 14%.

When considering
the ternary blends in relation to the neat PP,
all samples showed a loss in the tensile strength. It may be reasoned
that the poor miscibility of the biopolymers, PLA and PHBV, into the
PP matrix does not provide good stress transfer, thus reducing the
tensile strength. PHBV on its own has a tensile strength of 35 MPa
which will decrease the performance of the ternary blend. Though PLA
has a higher tensile strength than PP, the lack of compatibility between
PP and PLA leads to poor mechanical performance. Out of the three
ternary blends, the one containing 55 wt % PLA in the biopolymer portion
showed the optimum strength and modulus. Once the fillers were incorporated
into this ternary blend, the modulus was increased above that of the
neat PP because of the high stiffness of the carbon and mineral components.

When analyzing the flexural properties of the blends and composites,
a similar trend is observed. The fillers cause a loss of flexural
strength but not to the extent seen in the tensile data. The difference
may arise from the fact that flexural tests during three-point bending
combine tension on the bottom of the test bar and compression on the
top of the test bar. The compressive strength of the material will
be higher with the fillers, as both the biocarbon and talc are denser
than the PP matrix but will ultimately have a lower tensile component.
The flexural strength of the ternary blends containing a greater portion
of PLA showed a minor increase over PP. The benefit of including PLA
is seen here with its high flexural strength of 95 MPa which is more
than offsetting the PHBV components’ flexural strength of 57
MPa. That is why the greater content of PLA in the ternary blend improved
both the flexural strength and modulus. Again, once the fillers were
included in the ternary system, the modulus was further increased.
However, in the case of the talc addition, the two-dimensional (2-D)
plate structure enhanced the flexural strength by 4%.

To characterize
the toughness of the samples, notched Izod impact
testing was conducted. During these measurements, all of the blends
and composites had complete breaks and were evaluated after specimen
toss energy correction when less than 27 J·m–1. The resultant data can be seen in Figure 3 for the impact properties of the materials.
All samples showed enhanced impact strength capabilities over the
neat PP. The inclusion of the fillers provided an improvement in the
notch impact. The well-dispersed particles in the PP matrix are responsible
for imparting a more uniformly distributed impact energy.20 Other aspects that the fillers provide toward
enhancement of the impact strength are the crack pinning, which augments
fracture energy, and particle pull-out.21 The minor difference between the biocarbon and the talc composite
impact strengths may be attributed to the variation in particles’
aspect ratios, with the greater aspect ratio of the platy structure
of the talc, causing a larger stress concentration compared to the
biocarbon and reducing the mobility of the molecular chains during
impact.21,22

Figure 3 Impact strength and elongation at yield of the
PP blends and composites
(samples with arithmetic means that do not share a letter are significantly
different; uppercase: impact strength and lowercase: elongation at
yield).

When examining the ternary blends
of PP/PLA/PHBV, they all have
a 15 J·m–1 increase over PP. Each of the three
neat polymers has a similar impact strength, with PP, PLA, and PHBV
having values of 12, 15, and 14 J·m–1, respectively.
Therefore, the morphology of the minor phases within the PP matrix
may cause obstructions in the crack propagation through the PP matrix,
allowing for absorption of impact energy through pull-outs and further
energy requirements for crack initiation of the minor phases. There
will also be a greater toughening of the blend system as the compatibility
of the PP and PLA phases is improved due to PHBV acting as an intermediary
for stress transfer between the polymers.23

Looking at the impact strength of the quaternary composites,
the
performance is reverted to that of the PP composites. There is a larger
standard deviation present in these as the fillers disturb the morphology
of the minor phases in the blend system. The strengthening is now
dominated by the fillers once again, and the same factors mentioned
previously would apply.

The percent elongation at yields for
the tensile tests are also
shown in Figure 3.
It is evident that in the presence of the biocarbon the elongation
is reduced, resulting from its brittle nature, poor compatibility,
wide particle size distribution, and restriction of polymer chains.24 In the case of talc addition, the 2-D platelet
structure of talc provides easier chain sliding during testing, increasing
the elongation at yield, as the small particle size of the talc is
known to elevate the elongation marginally.25 For the ternary blends, the reduction in elongation comes mainly
from the low elongation of PLA and PHBV being 2.2 and 1.5%, respectively.
Then, the resulting quaternary composites have even lower elongation
at break as the particles now cause imperfections throughout the system
along with the low elongation of the blend.

Thermomechanical Analysis
Heat
Deflection Temperature
The analysis of the heat
deflection temperature (HDT) is a way to determine the processing
temperature boundaries for molded parts and the thermal limits for
a product. It is a measure of the temperature where a material undergoes
a 0.25 mm flexural deflection under a specified load and relies on
the temperature dependence associated with the flexural modulus.26 The HDTs of the eight samples discussed in this
paper are presented in Figure 4. For the neat PP sample, an HDT of 114 °C was measured.
When the fillers of biocarbon or talc were used, the composite samples
showed similar HDTs with no change when considering the standard deviation.
The ternary blends on the other hand had a reduced HDT <100 °C.
PLA having a measured HDT of 57 °C caused reduced thermal stiffness
at elevated temperatures, as can be seen when increasing PLA weight
percentages in the blend system. PHBV was used in part to offset this
as it has a measured HDT of 143 °C, though it did not follow
the rule of mixtures well as PP5545 resulted in the experimental value
of 94 °C when it is calculated to be approximately 108.5 °C,
which could be a result of the morphology of the blend system. Next,
when looking at the quaternary composites, the HDTs are heightened
for both instances from the blend. The biocarbon inclusion had a greater
improvement with a 24% increase from the ternary blend and returned
to the range of the PP/biocarbon composite sample having an HDT of
117 °C. The increased HDT values observed for the quaternary
composites may be attributed to the increased stiffness as seen in
the mechanical data with the variation between the two samples associated
with differences in the filler shape, size, orientation, aspect ratio,
adhesion, and size distribution.27

Figure 4 HDT and CLTE
of the PP blends and composites.

Thermomechanical Analysis
A common trait of polymeric
materials is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE). By
analyzing this property, a minimal expansion temperature range may
be determined to reduce the likelihood of thermal shock or very precise
dimensional fluctuations and allow for implementation in interfaces
with similar CLTE.28 The thermal stability
of most isotropic polymers is enhanced with the inclusion of inorganic
fillers as they have low expansion coefficients as compared to the
polymer matrix.29 In the case of the PP
composites tested, the same trend is evident for the addition of biocarbon
and talc samples, as seen in Figure 4. The neat PP had a CLTE of 101 μm/(m·°C)
in the temperature range of 25–50 °C, similar to that
of 93 μm/(m·°C) in a slightly cooler range of 0–30
°C found in the literature.30 The
reduction in the CLTE value was more apparent in the case of biocarbon
addition, with 20 μm/(m·°C) reduction or 20% decrease,
whereas talc only reduced the CLTE by half as much as the biocarbon.
Next, when analyzing the ternary blend systems, the thermal stability
was improved further with a CLTE value from 58 to 67 μm/(m·°C)
with increasing PHBV content. The reasoning behind this reduction
is related to the low CLTE of the biopolymers, with PLA and PHBV measured
to have 61 and 54 μm/(m·°C), respectively. Therefore,
with more PHBV present in the PP5050 blend, the lower the CLTE out
of the three ternary blends. Another factor in the reduction of CLTE
for the ternary blend systems may come as a result of the minor phases
impeding the PP matrix from expanding, with PLA being a rigid obstacle
below its Tg and being surrounded with
PHBV. When the fillers are used in the ternary blend system, only
the biocarbon could reduce the CLTE, whereas the talc caused no change
within the standard deviation. The quaternary composite-containing
biocarbon showed a CLTE of 51, which is a reduction of 23% compared
to the ternary blend PP5545 and a 50% reduction over the neat PP.
This demonstrates the superior thermal stability performance of the
biocarbon over the talc filler.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Morphological Analysis
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
was performed on the Izod impact
fractured surfaces of the PP-based materials. For the neat PP, there
are no distinguishable features present as the material undergoes
a brittle fracture with a smooth surface, as seen in Figure 5. In the case of the PP composite
system, the biocarbon is randomly distributed throughout the matrix
with varying particle dimensions. In the biocarbon-containing samples,
the macropores (≤10 μm) of the biocarbon are visible
with PP penetrating into them, which was also observed in the quaternary
composites. A good dispersion of talc in PP was also found (not presented).
In the case of the ternary blends, the minor bioplastic phase was
found in the form of spheres or elongated globules throughout the
PP matrix with a wide range of sizes. The droplet-shaped minor phase
is similar to the sea–island morphology, which is determined
from the components’ viscosity and volume ratios.31 To distinguish between minor phases of PLA and
PHBV in the blend, etching was performed to remove the PLA component.
The resulting holes and voids observed were in the location of PLA.
As seen in Figure 6, the etched sample of the PP5050 ternary blend shows cavities within
the minor PHBV phase. This finding correlates well with the solubility
and spreading coefficient calculations previously mentioned. An illustration
of the ternary blend morphology is also presented to depict the core–shell
characteristic of the system. The same topography was seen for all
ternary blends. Upon addition of the fillers into the ternary blend,
the size of the minor phase is disturbed and tends toward smaller
domains. The fillers themselves are confined within the PP matrix,
whereas the biopolymer core–shell configuration is retained,
as seen with the etched-out surface showing the same hollowed-out
PHBV.

Conclusions
The morphology, mechanical, and thermomechanical
properties of
the PP/PLA/PHBV ternary blends and composites containing biobased
carbon and talc were examined. The findings showed that the spreading
coefficient determined through the contact angle and solubility parameter
values coincided well with the structure observed for the ternary
blend seen under SEM imaging. The minor biopolymer inclusions formed
a core–shell arrangement with PHBV coating the PLA phase, within
the PP matrix. On the basis of the statistical analysis, the ternary
blend showed a reduction in the tensile performance but was contrasted
by the improved flexural and impact properties above the neat PP when
the ratio of PLA to PHBV was greater for the 30 wt % biopolymer component
of the blend. Once the fillers of biocarbon and talc were present
in the quaternary composite, the moduli of the samples were enhanced
above both PP and the ternary blends. In the case of the biocarbon
specifically, the HDT and CLTE values were ameliorated above all other
samples, providing the most thermally stable specimens and a maximum
biobased content of 37 wt %. The resulting partially biobased composites
analyzed in this study may provide further insights into the advancement
of cost-performance balance materials, whereas the use of the miscibility
models to quickly predict the compatibility between the polymers remains
an asset when researching new blend interactions.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Three injection grade polymers were utilized
in this investigation including 1120H homopolymer PP provided by Pinnacle
Polymers (USA), Ingeo 3251D PLA, a product of NatureWorks LLC (USA),
and ENMAT Y1000P PHBV with 3% HV32 content
acquired from TianAn Biological Materials Co., Ltd. (China). Along
with these polymers, two types of particulate fillers were used as
received from their respective suppliers. The first one is Mistron
Vapor R talc from Imerys Talc (Canada), with a mean size range of
1.7–2.2 μm, a surface area of 13.4 m2·g–1, and a density of 2.8 g·cm–3 (technical data sheet). The second one is a biobased carbon produced
from the pyrolysis of miscanthus grass at 700 °C supplied by
Competitive Green Technologies (Canada), with particles ≤400
μm33 having an average size range
of 20–75 μm,34 an ash content
of ∼10%,35 a carbon content >80%,
a surface area of 100–200 m2·g–1, and a density of 1.4 g·cm–3.

Specimen Preparation
The biopolymers PLA and PHBV were
dried at 80 °C in an industrial oven for a minimum of 4 h prior
to processing, whereas the biocarbon was dried at 105 °C for
24 h to remove excess moisture. The PP polymer was kept under room-temperature
conditions and used as received, along with the talc powder. Processing
of the samples was performed with a 15 mL microcompounder DSM Xplore
with a corotating twin screw extruder (Netherlands). At a screw speed
of 100 rpm and a temperature of 180 °C, the materials were added
according to the weight ratios of the different formulations. The
retention time was set to 2 min before being injection-molded at 30
°C in a DSM Xplore 12 mL microinjection molding machine. Tensile,
flexural, and impact bars were prepared for further analysis. Neat
PP, PLA, and PHBV samples were also prepared under the same conditions
for use in contact angle measurements and comparison of mechanical
results.

Characterization
The base polymer for the blends was
PP, which acted as a baseline for the other samples under investigation.
The PP matrix
component was set at 70 wt % of the blend ratio with the biopolymer
component making up the other 30 wt % of the blend, whereas the inclusion
of the filler was kept at a constant ratio of 10 wt % for the composite
samples. See Table 4 for the complete formulation breakdown, where the abbreviation of
the samples is used to distinguish the ratio of the biopolymer component
of PLA/PHBV within the PP matrix. An example is PP5545 which refers
to PP/(PLA/PHBV) having a 70/(55/45) wt %. Upon filler addition, such
as biocarbon, to this same blend, it becomes PP5545BC10 where the
ratio is [70/(55/45)]/10 wt % for [PP/(PLA/PHBV)]/biocarbon.

Contact Angle
Measurements
The ramé-hart standard
goniometer contact angle equipment model 260-U1 was used to test extruded
samples containing only the neat polymers PP, PLA, or PHBV. The contact
angles were measured by the static sessile drop technique, where drops
of liquid were microsyringed onto the sample. The tests were conducted
at room temperature (∼20 °C) with an injection-molded
sample, and a drop of either deionized water or diiodomethane was
used as the polar and nonpolar liquid, respectively. See Table 5 for the total surface
free energies and related components for the two liquids. With the
DROPimage software (version 2.8.05), the contact angles were calculated
with the circle method using the captured images. A total of three
repetitions were performed on each sample to obtain an average and
standard deviation.

a Values obtained from ref (36).

From the contact
angles measured, the surface tensions of the three
polymers may be calculated. This is done using Young’s equation37 3  where γs and γl are the surface tensions at the equilibrium
of the solid–vapor
and liquid–vapor, respectively, γsl is the
solid–liquid interfacial tension, and θ is the measured
contact angle. This concept can be extended further by using the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble
(OWRK) model that splits the surface tension into two intermolecular
forces that act at the interface.38−40 The two components are
a dispersive and polar portion that makes up the sum of the surface
tension values. The OWRK equation is then written as 4  where the superscripts d and p refer to the
dispersive and polar components of the surface tension, respectively,
and θ is the measured contact angle converted to radians. On
the basis of the contact angles measured for the two liquids and their
known surface tension values (γl, γld, and γlp), see Table 5, eq 4 becomes a calculation of two equations
with two unknowns (γsd and γsp). The contributing components of the surface
tension and the total sum (γs = γsd + γsp) for the polymers
were then obtained.

The interfacial tension between each of
the polymers was then calculated
to provide further insights into the most probable morphology. Both
the harmonic mean equation41,42 5  and
the geometric mean equation 6  where the subscripts i and j refer to two separate polymers were used to identify the
magnitude of interfacial tension between the three combinations of
polymers.

Solubility Parameter Calculation
To provide a greater
understanding of the miscibility of the ternary blend, estimation
of the solubility parameter (δ) for each of the three polymers
was done. This is a technique that describes the cohesive forces of
materials and is a good predictor in the case of miscibility for polymers
and solvents.43 The initial method of calculating
the solubility behavior was developed by Hildebrand and further modified
by splitting the parameter into a polar, dispersive, and hydrogen-bonding
component by Hansen.44 This adaption of
the solubility parameter can then be approximated using the Hoftyzer–van
Krevelen and Hoy methods45 based on the
individual groups of the polymer chain.

Therefore, to determine
the solubility parameters of the polymers, the Hoftyzer–van
Krevelen and Hoy approximation techniques were used. These methods
involve summing up the contributions of the functional groups within
the chemical structure to the dispersive, polar, and hydrogen-bonding
components. In the case of the polymers used in this investigation,
the average molecular weights (Mw) were
chosen to establish the degree of polymerization from the monomer
units. The Mw of PLA, PHBV, and PP used
were 55 000,46 240 000,47 and 170 00048 g·mol–1, respectively.

Mechanical
Testing
For the measurement of the mechanical
strength and stiffness of the material, the Instron 3382 Universal
testing machine was utilized. Under room-temperature conditions, type
IV tensile bars were tested at a rate of 5 mm/min, according to ASTM
D638. Similarly, the flexural specimens were tested at a rate of 1.4
mm/min with a span length of 52 mm following procedure A of ASTM D790.
All tensile and flexural results were evaluated with Bluehill software.

A TMI Monitor Impact tester was used for the data acquisition of
the notched Izod impact strengths of the samples conforming to method
C of ASTM D256 with a 6.78 J pendulum. The impact bars were prenotched
with a motorized notching cutter, 40 h prior to testing. To provide
averages and standard deviations, five of each sample type were measured.

For statistical analysis of the mechanical data, a one-way analysis
of variance (significance level α = 0.05) was performed using
Minitab 17 software, on the data of the individual samples. A Tukey
pairwise comparison test was conducted with the groupings determined
with 95% confidence intervals, showing means that do not share the
same letter as being significantly different.

Thermomechanical Analysis
A dynamic mechanical analyzer,
DMA Q800 instrument (TA Instruments), was used to conduct measurements
for the HDT of the specimens. The ASTM D648 standard was followed,
with a load of 0.455 MPa in a three-point bending configuration, where
the heating rate was set at 2 °C/min starting at 30 °C until
a 250 μm displacement was obtained.

For the CLTE, a thermomechanical
analyzer, TMA Q400 (TA Instruments), was set up in accordance with
ASTM E831. The samples were tested with an expansion probe normal
to the injection flow direction. The testing conditions were set at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min, from 20 to 60 °C, with a 0.1
N probe force. The CLTE was then calculated in the linear range of
25–50 °C to remain below the nonlinear region associated
with the glass-transition temperature of PLA.

The Universal
Analysis 2000 software v. 4.5A (TA Instruments) was
used to analyze the thermomechanical data from both tests.

Microscopy
Imaging
To provide a visual image of the
morphology of various samples, a scanning electron microscope Phenom
ProX (Phenom-World BV) was used. The impact samples fractured surfaces
were used as the image region. The samples were tested with and without
etching for 4 h in tetrahydrofuran, to dissolve away PLA from the
blends. The SEM settings were kept constant with an accelerating voltage
of 5 kV, a 1500× magnification, and a charge reduction stage.
