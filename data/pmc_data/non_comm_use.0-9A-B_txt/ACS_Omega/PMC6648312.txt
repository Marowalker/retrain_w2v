(1R,10bR)-1′-((R)-1,2-Dihydroxyethyl)-1-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxy1,5,6,10b-tetrahydropyrrolo [2,1-a]isoquinolin-3(2H)-one, an analogue of (−)-crispine A, with three
stereogenic centers is synthesized and its absolute configuration
(AC) established using the combined information derived from the synthetic
scheme and single crystal X-ray diffraction data. The experimental
chiroptical spectra (namely, optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), electronic
circular dichroism (ECD), and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD))
and the corresponding quantum chemical (QC) predicted spectra for
all diastereomers are used to evaluate the AC. The AC of the synthesized
compound could be correctly established using any one of the three
chiroptical spectroscopic methods (ORD, ECD, or VCD) when the relative
configuration is constrained to be that derived from X-ray data or
when the ACs of two of the chiral centers are constrained to be those
derived from the synthetic scheme. In the absence of this outside
information, the QC predicted ORD, ECD, and VCD for incorrect diastereomers
are also found to satisfactorily reproduce the corresponding experimental
spectra. Nevertheless, incorrect diastereomers could be eliminated
when combined electronic dissymmetry factor (EDF) and vibrational
dissymmetry factor (VDF) spectral analyses are included, leaving the
correct diastereomer as the sole choice. Thus, the combined EDF and
VDF spectral analysis is seen to be a helpful diastereomer discrimination
tool.

Introduction
Isoquinoline alkaloids,
such as crispine A, 1, (Figure 1), are important
synthetic targets due to their potential biological activity.1−7 (+)-1 isolated from Carduus crispus L. was found to exhibit antitumor activity against certain human
cancer lines.8 The chiral solvating agents
to determine the enantiomeric purity of crispine A have been investigated.9 The enantiopure synthesis of an analogue of (−)-1 has been reported recently using garcinia acid isolated
in large amounts from tropical plant sources.7

Determination of the stereostructures of chiral natural products
with multiple chiral centers can be challenging. Good-quality crystals
are often difficult to grow for use in single-crystal X-ray diffraction
methods. In such cases, the use of NMR methods has been the widely
adopted approach, although several cases are known where stereostructures
were misassigned.10−12 Chiroptical spectroscopy (optical spectroscopy suitable
for studying chiral molecules) methods have become popular in recent
years for the determination of absolute configurations (ACs) of chiral
molecules.13,14 Four different methods, namely,
optical rotatory dispersion (ORD),15 electronic
circular dichroism (ECD),16 vibrational
circular dichroism (VCD),17 and vibrational
Raman optical activity (VROA),18 are widely
practiced under the banner of chiroptical spectroscopy. ORD is a measure
of specific optical rotation (SOR) as a function of wavelength, whereas
SOR itself is derived from the measured optical rotation (OR) by normalizing
it with concentration (in g/cm3) and path length (in dm).
The measured OR represents the rotation of plane polarized light by
chiral molecules. Circular dichroism (CD) is a measure of differential
absorption of left and right circularly polarized light as a function
of wavelength or wavenumber. ECD arises from electronic transitions
that appear in the UV–visible spectral region, whereas VCD
arises from vibrational transitions that appear in the infrared spectral
region. VROA represents differential vibrational Raman scattering
of right and left circularly polarized light. Each of these methods
has their own specific advantages/disadvantages for interrogating
the chiral molecular structures, but simultaneous use of more than
one method often leads to more robust structural elucidation.19 Recent developments in quantum chemical (QC)
methods20−22 and their implementations in computer software23−25 for predicting chiroptical spectra facilitated and popularized the
analysis of experimental spectra using QC predicted spectra for deducing
the chiral molecular structures.

In this manuscript, we utilize
ORD, ECD, and VCD spectroscopies
and X-ray crystallography for investigating the molecular structure
of an analogue of (−)-1 synthesized from enantiopure
(2S,3S)-dimethyl-tetrahydro-3-hydroxy-5-oxo-2,3-furandicarboxylate
(garcinia ester, 2) in two steps involving 3 and 4 (see Scheme 1). Though there are possibilities for forming two analogues
of 1 from the intermediate 4, only 5, namely, (1R,10bR)-1′-((R)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)-1-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxy1,5,6,10b-tetrahydropyrrolo [2,1-a]isoquinolin-3(2H)-one, is obtained. The absolute configurations (ACs) at the three
stereogenic centers of 5 are deduced from the synthetic
scheme, and the relative configurations determined from the X-ray
structure. To evaluate the capabilities of chiroptical spectroscopic
methods for independently establishing the AC, the experimental ORD,
ECD, and VCD spectra of 5 are also analyzed using the
corresponding QC predicted spectra for all possible diastereomers.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme and Atom Numbering Used for Specifying the AC of 5
Results and Discussion
AC of
5
The procedure for chemical synthesis of 5 has
been reported before.7 Specifically
(see Scheme 1), garcinia
acid ester ((2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2,3-dicarboxylate), 2, was first reacted with (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine
to generate (S)-methyl 2-((S)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-3-hydroxy-2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-2-hydroxyacetate, 3. During this transformation, the ACs at chiral carbon atoms
remain the same. In the subsequent step, there are possibilities for
forming 5 and 6 from 3. The
key synthetic step involved here is the cyclization of the N-acyliminium ion, 4 (Scheme 1).26−28 The use of NaBH4 results
in the formation of 5 exclusively. Conversion of 3 to 5, via intermediate 4, occurs
without altering the stereochemistry. Therefore, it is logical to
conclude that the ACs of the chiral carbon atoms 1 and 1′ are
(R). However, a new chiral center is formed at position
10b, whose AC was suggested7 using two-dimensional NMR correlations to be R.
An independent verification of this assignment is needed. For this
purpose, single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements are undertaken
to determine the relative configurations at positions 10b, 1, and 1′. The crystal structure of 5 is shown
in Figure 2, which
indicates that positions 10b, 1, and 1′ should
all have the same stereo-descriptors under Cahn–Ingold–Prelog
sequence rules.29 Therefore, the AC of 5 should be either (1R,10bR,1′R) or (1S,10bS,1′S). Since the ACs at 1 and 1′ positions
are known from the synthetic scheme to be R, the
AC of 5 is (1R,10bR,1′R), as depicted in Scheme 1, and is in agreement with that derived from
two-dimensional NMR correlations.7

Chiroptical Spectroscopic
Analysis of the (1R,10bR,1′R) Diastereomer
The details of experimental methods
and spectral similarity overlap
(SSO) analysis are given in the Methods section.

Conformational
Analysis and Spectral Predictions
The
structure of 5 with (R)-configuration
at each of the three chiral centers was manually built and used as
input for conformational search using the CONFLEX program.30 The geometries of 1730 unique conformers generated
by CONFLEX were optimized using the B3LYP functional31−33 and the 6-31G* basis set34 as implemented
in the Gaussian 09 program.35 This process
led to 1236 optimized structures within an energy spread of 19.2 kcal/mol.
Of these, the six lowest energy structures account for 97% of the
population. The geometries of these six lowest energy conformers were
further optimized using the polarizable continuum model (PCM)36 for representing methanol solvent at the CAM37-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM level and the resulting
structures used for ECD and ORD calculations at the same level. ECD
and ORD calculations were also undertaken for all diastereomers using
empirical D3 dispersion corrections.38 No
significant differences could be found between the results obtained
with and without dispersion corrections. For VCD calculations, geometry
optimizations and QC predictions of VCD were undertaken at the B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM
level. To account for deuterium exchange in the CD3OD solvent
that was used for experimental VCD measurements, the O–H groups
of 5 were converted to O-D for VCD calculations. For
(1R,10bR,1′R) and (1R,10bS,1′R) diastereomers, full geometry optimizations and VCD calculations
were also carried out including empirical D3 dispersion corrections,
but the inclusion of dispersion corrections did not provide improvement
over those without dispersion corrections. All ECD and VCD calculations
were also undertaken using the Gaussian 09 program.35

There are no significant differences in the populations
generated from electronic energies (at CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol))
and Gibbs free energies (at B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol)).
The six lowest energy conformers of the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer are displayed
in Figure 3. In these
conformers, O–H groups are seen to be oriented for favorable
intramolecular O–H···O–H hydrogen-bonding
network. The relative orientations of O–CH3 groups
differ among these conformers. The lowest energy conformer (#95) with
∼86% population has the methoxy groups turned away from each
other, as also seen in the crystal structure; however, unlike in the
crystal structure that has cocrystallized water molecules, the hydroxyl
groups in the isolated molecule adopt an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
network as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Six lowest energy conformers of the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer. The intramolecular
H-bonding network among the three O–H groups is depicted for
each of the conformers with dashed lines, and H-bond lengths are listed
in units of Å.

Table 1 reports
the Gibbs energies, populations, and ring puckering angles for these
six lowest energy conformers. All conformers have nearly the same
ring puckering angles. Conformers with ring puckering angles opposite
to the ones listed in Table 1 have higher energies and are not expected to be populated
at room temperature. The lowest energy conformer (#95) is expected
to be dominant with ∼86% population.

b The N4–C5–C6–C6a
and C1–C2–C3–N4 ring puckering angles in the
crystal structure are −52.2 and −22.6, respectively.

The predicted SORs for 5 are generated as a sum of
those of all six conformers with individual conformer specific rotations
weighted by its population. Similarly, predicted VA, VCD, EA, and
ECD spectral intensities for 5 are generated as a sum
of those of all six conformers with individual conformer spectral
intensities weighted by its population.

ORD of the (1R,10bR,1′R) Diastereomer
The experimental SORs measured
at six different wavelengths are compared to those predicted at the
CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol) level in Figure 4. The signs, as well as magnitudes,
of the predicted SORs for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer match those observed in
the experiment quite well. The excellent agreement between experimental
and QC predicted ORD supports the assigned AC, (1R,10bR,1′R), as well as the
predominant conformation listed in Table 1. However, it should be noted that since
methanol solvent can hydrogen bond to 5, the predominant
conformer of 5 in methanol solution can very well be
different from that predicted for an isolated molecule using PCM and
that difference may not be transparent from the predicted ORD.

Figure 4 Comparison
of experimental wavelength-dependent specific rotations
with those predicted for four diastereomers of 5 at the
CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol) level. Inclusion of empirical
D3 dispersion corrections did not influence these results.

ECD of the (1R,10bR,1′R) Diastereomer
The
experimental electronic absorption
(EA), ECD, and electronic dissymmetry factor (EDF) spectra are compared
to the corresponding spectra for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer in Figure 5. Since a single
conformer (#95) of the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer has the majority of the population (see Table 1), the Boltzmann-weighted
EA and ECD spectra are dominated by those of this conformer. The predicted
EA and ECD spectra for individual conformers and their comparison
to population-weighted spectra are given in Figure S1 of the SI. In Figure 5, the left vertical panel displays the predicted spectra with
wavelengths scaled by 1.02 (which corresponds to the maximum SimECD value) and overlaid on experimental spectra. In the
right vertical panel, QC predicted spectra obtained with unscaled
band positions are presented. The EA spectrum of 5 in
the 180 and 300 nm regions measured in methanol reveals three bands:
a stronger intensity band at 207, a weaker intensity band at 233,
and a weak-intensity broad band at 286 nm. The QC predicted EA spectrum
for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level similarly
shows three bands at 194, 225, and 253 nm. The experimentally measured
ECD spectrum for 5 shows four bands at 203, 216, 229,
and 242 nm associated with negative, positive, negative, and positive
signs, respectively. The negative (229 nm) and positive (242 nm) bisignate
couplet appears to be associated with the experimental 233 nm absorption
band. The CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol) predicted ECD spectrum
reveals only three bands with a sign pattern of negative, positive,
and positive at 200, 226, and 252 nm, respectively. The experimental
negative cotton effect (CE) at 229 nm is not reproduced in the QC
predicted spectrum, resulting in the correlation of the experimental
(with predicted) ECD spectrum as follows: 200 (203), 216 (226), and
242(252) nm. Based on the predicted EA and ECD spectra, the electronic
transitions observed in the experimental spectrum are considered to
arise from those in the benzene ring. The molecular orbitals identifying
the electronic transition associated with the predicted CEs are displayed
in Figures S2–S4 of the SI.

Figure 5 Comparison
of experimental EA, ECD, and EDF spectra with those
predicted for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer at CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol).
In the left vertical panel, the predicted wavelengths are scaled with
1.02 (which corresponds to maximum SimECD) and overlaid
on experimental spectra. In the right vertical panel, QC predicted
spectra obtained with unscaled band positions are presented. Inclusion
of empirical D3 dispersion corrections did not influence these results.

The spectral similarity overlap
(SSO) plots provide quantitative
assessment of the agreement between experimental and predicted spectra.
The maximum SimEA, SimECD, and SimEDF values seen for (1R,10bR,1′R) are 0.96, 0.84, and 0.45, respectively
(Figure 6A). Ideally,
these values should be close to 1 for perfect agreement, but SimECD, and SimEDF values greater than
∼0.4, are considered necessary to reflect a reliable agreement
between experiment and predictions. Therefore, a large SimECD value, and SimEDF value greater than 0.4, provides
further support for the conclusions derived from ORD analyses.

experimental EA, ECD, and EDF spectra with

not influence these results.

VCD of the (1R,10bR,1′R) Diastereomer
The experimental vibrational absorption
(VA), VCD, and vibrational dissymmetry factor (VDF) spectra of 5 in the 1800–1160 cm–1 region are
compared to the corresponding spectra predicted for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer,
with deuterated OH groups, in Figure 7. In the left vertical panel of Figure 7, the predicted wavenumbers are scaled with
0.9815 (which corresponds to the maximum SimVCD value)
and overlaid on the experimental spectra. In the right vertical panel,
predicted spectra with unscaled wavenumbers are stacked over experimental
spectra and band positions labeled. The correlations of experimental
(and the corresponding unscaled predicted) VA band positions in cm–1 noted from the stacked spectra are as follows: 1670(1712),
1609(1644), 1516(1551), 1462(1487), 1443(1469), 1408(1434), 1354(1385),
1257(1292), and 1223(1250). Similarly, the correlations of experimental
(and the corresponding unscaled predicted) VCD band positions in cm–1 are as follows: 1674(1713), 1516(1548), 1470(1491),
1450(1472), 1404(1429), 1296(1323), 1261(1287), 1230(1247), and 1207(1231).
The positive experimental VCD band at 1354 cm–1 does
not appear to have a corresponding positive predicted counterpart.
This comparison indicates that most of the experimental bands are
satisfactorily reproduced in the predicted spectra. Additionally,
the relative intensities for all calculated VCD bands match those
in the experimental spectrum.

Figure 7 Comparison of experimental VA, VCD, and VDF
spectra with those
predicted for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer, with deuterated OH groups, at B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol).
In the left vertical panel, the predicted wavenumbers are scaled with
0.9815 (which corresponds to the maximum SimVCD value)
and overlaid on experimental spectra. In the right vertical panel,
QC predicted spectra with unscaled wavenumbers are stacked over experimental
spectra and band positions labeled.

It should be added that while experimental spectra are measured
in the CD3OD solvent where hydrogen bonding between the
solute and solvent can take place, the predicted spectra used PCM,
which does not account for solute–solvent hydrogen bonding.
As a consequence, one may anticipate poorer agreement for some PCM
predicted vibrational bands in hydrogen-bonding solvents, leading
to lower SSO values. Contrary to this anticipation, however, the agreement
between experimental and predicted VCD spectra can be seen in Figure 7 to be excellent.
The quantitative agreement between experimental and predicted spectra
can be judged using maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values in SSO plots. While SimVA values are not useful for AC assignment, SimVCD values, as well as SimVDF values greater than
or equal to ∼0.4,39 are considered
necessary to validate the agreement between experiment and predicted
VCD spectra. The similarity analysis for the 1800–1160 cm–1 region yields maximum SimVCD and SimVDF values of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively, for (1R,10bR,1′R), as
seen in Figure 8A.
Such large values are normally encountered for small rigid molecules
in non-hydrogen-bonding solvents and are uncommon for VCD spectra
measured in the methanol-d4 solvent. The
quantitative agreement of experimental VCD and VDF spectra of 5 with those predicted for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer can therefore
be considered excellent. Thus, the detailed analysis of the VCD spectra
provides further support for the conclusions derived from ORD and
ECD analyses.

those predicted for four diastereomers, with deuterated OH groups,
at B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM(methanol). (A) (1R,10bR,1′R), (B) (1R,10bS,1′R), (C) (1S,10bR,1′R), and
(D) (1S,10bS,1′R). Inclusion of empirical D3 dispersion corrections for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer
resulted in lowered similarity measures; that for the (1R,10bS,1′R) diastereomer
did not make significant changes to the data shown.

The successful reproduction of experimental VCD
spectra in the
methanol-d4 solvent by B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p)
predictions, with PCM representing the hydrogen-bonding methanol solvent,
can either be fortuitous or suggest one of the following two possibilities:
(a) the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network among the three O–H
groups (see Figure 3) could be providing a stabilizing environment compared to intermolecular
hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules or (b) the predicted spectra
for 5 with intermolecular hydrogen bonding may not be
significantly different from the ones obtained for 5 with
intramolecular hydrogen bonding. These later assertions require the
verification of the relative stability of, and spectral predictions
for, solute conformers that are hydrogen bonded to methanol solvent
molecules. One approach for determining the conformers that are hydrogen
bonded to solvent molecules is to incorporate 1–3 explicit
solvent molecules hydrogen bonded to one solute molecule and undertake
theoretical predictions. However, such approaches lead to arbitrariness
in the relative orientations of solvent molecules. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of the solute molecule embedded in a methanol solvent
bath can provide a more reliable approach for this purpose. We hope
to pursue the MD simulations in the near future.

band assignments for the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer derived from
the animated vibrational motions in the GaussView program40 are provided in Table S3 of the SI.

Chiroptical Spectroscopic Discrimination
of Diastereomers
For chiral molecules with multiple stereocenters,
it has become
a common practice in the literature to predict chiroptical spectra
for the relative configuration known from some other methods (such
as single-crystal X-ray diffraction and/or NMR) and eliminate one
of the two possible ACs using chiroptical spectroscopic methods. If
the same practice is used here for 5, and the information
derived from X-ray data or the synthetic scheme is imposed as a constraint,
then the AC of 5 could be correctly established using
any one of the three chiroptical spectroscopic methods (ORD, ECD,
or VCD). The relative configuration derived from X-ray data restricts
the consideration of AC to either (1R,10bR,1′R) or (1S,10bS,1′S). ORD, ECD, and VCD analyses individually
support the AC assignment as (1R,10bR,1′R) and do not support the AC assignment
as (1S,10bS,1′S). The synthetic scheme fixes the ACs at 1 and 1′ positions
to be (R), which restricts the consideration of AC
of 5 to either (1R,10bR,1′R) or (1R,10bS,1′R). Again, ORD, ECD, and VCD analyses
individually support the AC assignment as (1R,10bR,1′R) and do not support the AC
assignment as (1R,10bS,1′R) (vide infra).

The validity of AC derived from chiroptical
spectroscopic methods in this manner is subject to the validity of
relative configuration that is started with. Therefore, diastereomer
discrimination is an important objective for which recently developed
microwave chiral detection methods are being pursued.41,42 To ascertain if the chiroptical spectroscopic methods by themselves
can provide enough diastereomer discrimination and determine the AC
without depending on prior knowledge of relative configuration information,
or of ACs at some of the stereogenic centers, one has to undertake
QC predictions of chiroptical spectra for all possible diastereomers
and evaluate if the correct diastereomer can be ascertained.43−46 For this purpose, we have undertaken conformational analysis and
QC predictions for all possible diastereomers. Due to the presence
of three chiral centers, eight diastereomers are possible for 5. Among these, four diastereomers are mirror images of the
other four, so investigations are undertaken for four diastereomers:
(1R,10bR,1′R), (1R,10bS,1′R), (1S,10bR,1′R), and (1S,10bS,1′R). The previous sections dealt with the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer
that is known to represent the correct AC for 5 (vide
supra). Now we enquire if, in the absence of prior knowledge on the
AC of 5, the analyses of experimental and predicted ORD,
ECD, and VCD data can determine the correct diastereomer.

The
conformational analysis for the remaining diastereomers follows
that used for (1R,10bR,1′R). The energies, populations, and ring puckering angles
for conformers with a population of at least 1% are summarized in Table S4 of the SI. While (1S,10bR,1′R) and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers
have a single conformation with significantly higher populations than
others, the (1R,10bS,1′R) diastereomer has three conformations with significantly
higher populations than others.

The population-weighted ORD
values predicted for these diastereomers
are compared to the experimental ORD in Figure 4. It is seen that wavelength-dependent SORs
of the (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomer have the same signs and relatively closer
magnitudes to those of experimental values, and therefore (1S,10bR,1′R) remains
a viable candidate for assigning the AC of 5 based on
ORD alone. For the (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers, the signs of wavelength resolved SORs
are opposite to those of experimental values, and the absolute magnitudes
are comparable to the experimental magnitudes. Then, the antipodes
of these diastereomers, namely, (1S,10bR,1′S) and (1R,10bR,1′S), remain viable candidates
for assigning the AC of 5. Thus, the criterion of matching
the predicted ORD with the experimental ORD alone cannot be used as
the sole criterion for assigning the unknown ACs of chiral molecules.46

The SSO plots of EA, ECD, and EDF spectra
for (1R,10bS,1′R), (1S,10bR,1′R), and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers
are shown in Figure 6B–D, respectively, whereas individual comparisons of experimental
and predicted EA and ECD spectra are provided in Figures S5–S7 of the SI. In the case of (1S,10bR,1′R), the SSO plot
shows both positive and negative extremes of larger magnitudes for SimECD. Therefore, in principle, it becomes uncertain to
decide whether this diastereomer or its antipode matches the experimental
spectra. However, the negative extreme occurs for a scale factor <1.
Since predicted electronic transitions, at the theoretical level employed,
generally occur at shorter wavelengths, a scale factor >1 is preferred,
and therefore the positive extreme is considered for SimECD. The maximum SSO magnitudes for four diastereomers are summarized
in Table 2. From the
maximum SSO magnitudes in Table 2, it is seen that the (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomer yields positive SimECD and SimEDF values, whereas (1R,10bS,1′R) and
(1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers yield negative SimECD and SimEDF values. The SimEDF value for the
(1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomer is not of sufficient magnitude to place reliance on
the agreement. Thus, based on SimECD and SimEDF values, (1S,10bR,1′R) and antipode of (1R,10bS,1′R) remain viable
candidates for assigning the AC of 5.

b Inclusion of empirical
D3 dispersion
correction gives the SimECD, SimEDF, SimVCD, and SimVDF values
as 0.84, 0.45, 0.67, and 0.63, respectively.

c nclusion of empirical D3 dispersion
correction gives the SimECD, SimEDF, SimVCD, and SimVDF values
as −0.9, −0.5, −0.57, and −0.39, respectively.

d For this diasteromer, a large negative
SSO also occurs for ECD at a scale factor of 1.01. But EDF remains
positive; inclusion of empirical D3 dispersion correction gives the SimECD and SimEDF values as 0.9 and 0.62,
respectively.

e SimEDF remains
approximately constant without a maximum in the SSO plot. This is
an indication for unreliable conclusions; inclusion of empirical D3
dispersion correction gives the SimECD and SimEDF values as −0.83 and −0.3, respectively.

The SSO plots of VA, VCD, and
VDF spectra for (1R,10bS,1′R), (1S,10bR,1′R), and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers
are shown in Figure 8B–D, respectively, whereas individual comparisons of experimental
and predicted VA and VCD spectra are provided in Figures S8–S10 of the SI. The maximum SSO magnitudes
are summarized in Table 2. From Table 2, it
is seen that the diastereomer (1S,10bR,1′R) yields maximum positive SimVCD and SimVDF values. The (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers
yield maximum negative SimVCD and SimVDF values. Based only on the magnitudes of SimVCD,
(1R,10bS,1′R), (1S,10bR,1′R), and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers have large enough magnitudes to consider
the (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomer and the antipodes of (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomers
as viable candidates for AC assignment. The magnitude of SimVDF is also large enough to consider the antipode of (1S,10bS,1′R) as a viable candidate,
but those for (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomers are close to ∼0.4. Therefore, the
latter two would require further scrutiny for AC assignment.

It should be noted that the SimVDF value depends
on the experimental reliability criterion, that is, on the magnitudes
of experimentally measured VCD signals that are considered reliable.
If we consider that only the experimental VCD signals with ΔA/A greater than 10 ppm are reliable, then SimVDF values for (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomers come out as
−0.35 and 0.36, respectively (see Table S5 in the SI), and their magnitudes are still close to ∼0.4.
But if we consider that only the experimental VCD signals with ΔA/A greater than 40 ppm are reliable (as
has been recommended previously47), then SimVDF values for (1R,10bS,1′R) and (1S,10bR,1′R) diastereomers drop to −0.23
and 0.16, respectively (see Table S5 in
the SI), ruling out these two diastereomers as viable candidates.
For the (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomer, SimVDF values are −0.46
and −0.44, respectively, for 10 ppm and 40 ppm criteria (see
the Supporting Information), leaving its
antipode in the consideration for assigning AC. Based on SimVCD and SimVDF values alone, the antipode of the
(1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomer remains a viable candidate for assigning the AC of 5.

Thus, ORD, ECD, and VCD analyses, independently,
cannot provide
a unique solution to the AC of 5. A different situation
emerges when we combine the results obtained from all three methods. Table 3 summarizes the conclusions
derived from ORD comparisons and maximum SSO values derived from ECD
and VCD spectral analyses. In this table, a “Y” entry
indicates that the diastereomer belonging to that entry is a reliable
candidate for the correct AC assignment; an “M” entry
indicates that the antipode of the diastereomer belonging to that
entry is a reliable candidate for correct AC; entries with “U”
cast doubt on the reliability of AC assignment. The row belonging
to (1R,10bR,1′R) has all Y entries, so the assignment of AC to this diastereomer
is supported independently by ORD, ECD, EDF, VCD, and VDF. This is
not the case for the other three rows. (1S,10bR,1′R) and the antipode of (1R,10bS,1′R) are
not supported by the low magnitudes of VDF, whereas the antipode of
the (1S,10bS,1′R) diastereomer is not supported by the low magnitude of EDF. However,
when the conclusions from EDF and VDF analyses are combined, the (1R,10bR,1′R) diastereomer
emerges as the single reliable candidate, which is also the AC determined
from combined X-ray and synthetic analyses (vide supra).

a Y, possible contender; M, mirror
image is a possible contender; U, uncertain.

It is important to note that if EDF and VDF are not
included in Table 3 for assigning the
AC of 5, then four different diastereomers remain viable
candidates, without offering diastereomer discrimination. Therefore,
in the case of (−)-crispine A analogue investigated here, combined
similarity analysis of EDF and VDF spectra turned out to be essential
for determining the correct diastereomer.

For chiral molecules
with multiple chiral centers, the situation
encountered in the current work can occur more often than desired.
To recognize new opportunities, and any limitations, chiroptical spectroscopic
predictions should be undertaken for all possible diastereomers (regardless
of the availability of prior knowledge on relative configurations),
as recommended previously.43−46

Conclusions
An analogue of (−)-crispine
A with three stereogenic centers
has been synthesized and its AC established using the combined information
derived from the synthetic scheme and single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data. Either by constraining the relative configuration to be that
derived from X-ray data or by constraining the ACs at two of the chiral
centers to be those derived from the synthetic scheme, the AC of (−)-crispine
A analogue can be correctly established using any one of the three
chiroptical spectroscopic methods (ORD, ECD, or VCD). In the absence
of such outside information, separate independent analysis of ORD,
ECD, and VCD does not entail a unique solution to the AC, and multiple
diastereomers present themselves as viable candidates for the AC of
(−)-crispine A analogue. Combined EDF and VDF spectral analysis,
however, rules out the incorrect diastereomers. Thus, the combined
EDF and VDF spectral analysis is seen as a useful diastereomer discrimination
tool.

Methods
Experimental Section
X-ray Crystallography
Crystals of 5 were
obtained from the saturated solution of the chloroform/hexane solvent
system. The X-ray structure was obtained using a Bruker X8 KAPPA APEX
II diffractometer using a wavelength of 0.71 Å.

ORD, ECD,
and VCD Measurements
ORs were measured with
an AutoPol IV automatic polarimeter at six discrete wavelengths (633,
589, 546, 436, 405, and 365 nm) at a concentration of 5.87 mg/mL in
methanol solvent using a 0.5 dm quartz cell and converted to SORs
by dividing the ORs with concentration (g/cm3) and path
length (dm). The experimental EA and ECD spectra were measured at
0.38 mg/mL in methanol solvent with an AVIV 215 ECD spectrometer using
a 2 mm quartz cell. EA and ECD spectra were collected from 250 to
400 nm. Since absorbance at wavelengths shorter than 250 nm is too
high, a lower concentration of 0.048 mg/mL in methanol solvent was
used to collect EA and ECD spectra from 200 to 250 nm. These two sets
of spectra were converted to epsilon units and merged smoothly at
250 nm without adjustments. The experimental VA and VCD spectra were
measured with a ChiralIR VCD spectrometer at a concentration of 45
mg/mL in CD3OD solvent using the SL3 cell with BaF2 windows and 100 μm path length.

Spectral
Similarity Overlap (SSO) Plots
SSO is calculated
using the Sim function suggested by Shen et al.48 This Sim function is written
as39 1  In eq 1, hXXX(x) represents
the experimental spectrum as a function of the running index for x-axis values; subscript XXX represents the type of spectrum
(XXX = VA, VCD, VDF, EA, ECD, or EDF); fXXX (σ:x) represents the simulated predicted
spectrum obtained after scaling the predicted transition frequencies/wavelengths
with a scale factor σ; SimXXX (σ) represents
the numerical measure of SSO between experimental and predicted spectra
as a function of σ for the type of spectrum XXX; the integrals
run over a continuous spectral region of interest. The display of SimXXX (σ) as a function of σ is referred to
as the SSO plot. For similarity analysis, VA, VCD, VDF, EA, ECD, and
EDF spectra are normalized individually using square root of the sum
of squared intensities.49,50 The range for SimECD, SimVCD, SimEDF,
and SimVDF values is −1 to +1. A value of
+1 indicates perfect agreement of experimental spectra with predicted
spectra for the AC used in calculations. A value of −1 indicates
perfect agreement of experimental spectra with predicted spectra for
the AC opposite to the one used for calculations. The SimVA and SimEA values, which have a range of 0–1,
do not relay any information on AC.

While separate evaluations
of QC predictions of EA and ECD or VA and VCD spectral intensities
may appear satisfactory, EDF and VDF (ratio of ECD/VCD to EA/VA) spectra
are more challenging for QC predictions. For this purpose, we have
advocated the quantitative analysis of experimental and predicted
EDF and VDF spectra also for verifying the agreement between experimental
and predicted ECD and VCD spectra.39,47,51 The agreement between experimental and predicted
spectra is quantified using maximum numerical values of SimEA, SimECD, and SimEDF for ECD
spectra and SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values for VCD spectra in SSO plots. While SimEA and SimVA values come out to be generally
high and not very discriminatory, SimECD and SimEDF values for ECD, and SimVCD and SimVDF values for VCD, provide good measures of quantitative
agreement between experimental observations and QC predictions. Achieving
a SimVCD value of +0.4 or higher is recommended for
an acceptable agreement between experimental and calculated spectra
for assigning the correct molecular structures.39 Approximately the same value of SimVDF
is also recommended. The same criteria are used for SimECD and SimEDF.

The errors in concentration
and path length do not influence the
EDF and VDF spectra when both absorption and CD spectra are measured
simultaneously for the same sample and using the same instrument.
The influences of baseline offsets and of CD magnitude calibration
error are suppressed during the calculation of SimEDF and SimVDF by normalizing the intensities in
DF spectra. This process can take care of the situations where the
experimental baseline offset is constant as a function of wavenumber/wavelength
and experimental CD magnitudes are off by a constant as a function
of wavenumber/wavelength. If the CD baseline is not horizontal, then
DF spectra cannot be used. For this reason, it is important to have
a good-quality experimental CD spectrum with a horizontal baseline
before proceeding to calculate the DF spectrum.

Calculation
of DF spectra incorporates two features: (a) to help
remove the amplification of noise in the regions where absorbance
is nearly zero and the associated CD signal is only noise, a baseline
tolerance value for absorption spectra is incorporated; and (b) the
reliability level of experimental CD signals, determined by the experimental
reliability criterion (previously referred to as the experimental
robustness criterion47), based on the experimental
ΔA/A values, is introduced.
The choice for the experimental reliability criterion can vary from
instrument to instrument and for individual research groups. For calculating
the EDF spectra, we do not impose the experimental reliability criterion
since ECD spectra generally have a good signal-to-noise ratio. The
use of 40 ppm (i.e., ΔA/A =
4 × 10–5) as the threshold for reliability
results in blanking out the spectral regions with VDF less than 40
ppm, leading to spectral discontinuities in the VDF spectra. To avoid
the spectral discontinuities, the VDF spectral analysis presented
in this manuscript did not impose any experimental reliability criterion.
Nevertheless, we calculated the VDF spectra with experimental reliability
criteria of 10 ppm and 40 ppm, and the resulting SimVDF values are presented in Figure S5 of
the SI.
