A water-soluble
perylene diimide, aspartic acid-functionalized
perylene diimide (APDI), has shown significant sequential “turn-off”
and “turn-on” responses toward Cu2+ and inorganic
pyrophosphate (PPi), respectively. APDI was found to show selectivity
toward Cu2+ and inorganic PPi over adenosine monophosphate,
adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine triphosphate. The detection has
been studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy techniques. Incorporation
of Cu2+ into the solution of APDI results in a distinct
quenching of the fluorescence intensity, while there was no spectral
change in the presence of other metal ions. The formed APDI–Cu2+ ensemble can turn on its fluorescence signal when PPi is
present. The detection of PPi could be traced by looking at the change
in color of the solution under the naked eye. No interference was
observed from other anions, making the APDI–Cu2+aggregate a highly selective biosensor for PPi.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The most ingenious creation in the whole universe is unarguably
the creation of life, and when there is life, there are deterrents
to it. One of the most devastating and long-lasting deterrents to
life is disease. Diseases are ubiquitous as oxygen in our life. Hence,
it automatically produces a huge demand for the correct diagnosis
along with proper treatment of a disease. In the research field, inorganic
pyrophosphate has tipped the scales of our attention toward itself
immensely for being responsible for prior biological roles in our
body. People after the age of 30s or 40s suffer from common bone malfunctions.
Common bone diseases such as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease
(CPDD) arise from the accumulation of pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals
in joints1−5 and tissues surrounding them. It promotes the joint cartilage to
break down, causing various forms of painful arthritis often mistaken
as gout6 and other conditions.7 Generally, the occurrence of this disease increases
with age but can happen in young ages as well. Hence, proper diagnosis
of pyrophosphate is very much required. Pyrophosphate is produced
when adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed under cellular conditions
and present in DNA replication, regarded as an important parameter
in case of real-time DNA sequencing which can result in early cancer
detection. Early detection of abnormal levels of inorganic pyrophosphate
(PPi) in the synovial or intercellular fluids can lead to saving lives
by preventing CPDD or cancer in its inchoate stages.8−10 Apart from the sophisticated, costly, and time-consuming conventional
ways of detection like atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively
coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, voltammetry, computed tomography,
and radiography, we need to develop techniques that are cost-effective
and easy in handling.11−14

Although various types of fluorescent chemosensors have been
reported
to selectively detect PPi, there are only few reports on aqueous medium
existing in the literature.15−23 Czarnik et al. reported the sensing of PPi in pure aqueous solution
using anthracene derivatives.21 Hong et
al. developed a naphthalene-based fluorescent sensor that was selective
for PPi over ATP, which can work over a wide range of pH.22 Yoon et al. first reported a naphthalene diimide-based
fluorescent chemosensor for PPi at physiological pH taking advantage
of excimer formation.1

Perylene diimide
(PDI) derivatives have attracted much attention
in sensing applications due to their high fluorescent quantum yield,
high photostability, and large extinction coefficient but have the
disadvantage of being insoluble in water due to severe aggregation
resulting from π–π stacking.24−42 Many approaches have been reported to synthesize water-soluble perylene
diimide.43−47 Recently, perylene diimide-based sensors have been developed to
detect cations, anions, and biomolecules.28,29,34,38,45−47,49 However, simple and high-synthetic-yield PDI-based chemosensors
for PPi in 100% aqueous medium are rare in the literature. Muthuraj
and his co-workers made a three-component-based PDI–HIS + GO
+ Cu2+ system to detect PPi in aqueous medium, which is
quite sophisticated, and the preparation process requires sensitive
handling of the GO sheet for making it completely water-dispersible.46 Shi et al. have developed a PDI-based PDI–GlyAsp/Cu2+ system for detecting pyrophosphate anions in aqueous medium,
but this method required alkaline medium, which might not be appropriate
for protein or biomolecules sensitive toward alkali.47 Herein, we report a PDI-based chemosensor in 100% water
medium, which can selectively detect PPi over other coexisting anions
adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ATP.
Our developed chemosensing ensemble probe requires a simple preparation
method involving no sophisticated handling and simple aggregation–disaggregation
mechanism of PDI; it is soluble perfectly in neutral aqueous medium,
showing distinct color change visibly in the presence of PPi. The
synthesis of aspartic acid-functionalized perylene diimide (APDI)
has been described in our previous report. The aspartic acid-appended
PDI derivative, APDI, shows bright orange in its monomeric form in
aqueous medium. APDI in the presence of copper has been shown to quench
its fluorescence intensity selectively, bright orange color of APDI
turning to pale pink due to π–π stacking interaction
between perylene cores as Cu2+ helps in bringing the moieties
closer to each other. The idea behind singling out Cu2+ among all of the other metal ions is that Cu2+ has very
strong affinity toward PPi.47,48 Thus, in the presence
of PPi, the APDI–Cu2+ complex disaggregates to form
a Cu2+–PPi complex and sets the dye free in the
solution, which is responsible for the reappearance of the original
fluorescent color.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 1 UV–Vis and Fluorescence Titration
of APDI at Different pHs
A set of six different APDI solutions
(10 μM) was prepared, and the pH was adjusted at 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, and 9 by adding aq HCl/NaOH solution. The APDI solutions of different
pHs at the same concentration of 10 μM were kept for 20 min.
It has been found that the acidic one changed its color from orange
to pale pink (Figure S1). The optical measurements
were performed to see the changes in their ground state and excited
state. The solution mixtures were made homogeneous by shaking well
before all experiments. UV–vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra
were taken at 25 °C. It has been observed that at lower pH, i.e.,
at pH 4, aggregation occurs at its maximum and that in neutral pH
conditions, it gives intense monomeric peak. At pH 7, APDI mainly
shows three absorption peaks at 531, 494 and 463 nm and a weak broad
band at 430 nm, indicating the transition of S0 →
S1, with respective vibronic structure ν = 0 →
ν′ = 0, 1, 2 and 3 transitions respectively (Figure 1a).47 Due to the presence of a large hydrophobic π-conjugated
core of APDI derivatives, they aggregate30,31,41,56 at lower pH,
resulting in decrease of absorption band at 531 and 494 nm. The fluorescence
intensity of APDI is sensitive to the pH of the medium. The maximum
fluorescence intensity was observed in neutral solution having peaks
at 547 and 589 nm (Figure 1b), in which deprotonation of the hydrophilic carboxylic groups
on the APDI side chains likely hinders the formation of strongly coupled
aggregates. On the contrary, the fluorescence intensity was significantly
decreased in acidic medium due to protonation of the carboxylate groups,
which induces the formation of stable aggregates. The π-stacked
aggregates of APDI derivatives are stable in the protonated state,
but their supramolecular structure changes in neutral and basic media.
In the aggregate, monomeric units slide over their adjacent ones and
increase the intermolecular distance upon deprotonation. Intermolecular
hydrogen bonds may help maintaining the stability of the protonated
aggregate. Fluorescence spectra showed a pH dependence of APDI derivatives
with a nonlinearly increasing response ranging from pH 4 to 9, which
can be identified by naked eye when the color changes from pale pink
to orange.

°C with slit of 5/5 nm and λex = 440 nm.

2.2 Study of Specific Complexation
of APDI with
Cu2+ Ions
It is well known that the carboxyl group
(−COOH) has a very high binding45,47,50 tendency toward Cu2+, Ni2+,
Cd2+, and Zn2+ ions. Since the APDI derivative
comprises four chelating carboxylic groups (−COOH), we have
pursued to find the most apposite coordination metal ion pair. Hence,
we have carried out complexation of APDI with different metal ions,
viz, Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+ in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at room temperature.
As shown in Figure 2, sensor APDI in the presence of the Cu2+ ion shows a
change of color from orange to pale pink and fluorescence turns off
under UV light. To check the selectivity of the sensor APDI for Cu2+, the same experiments were carried out using Li+, Ag+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ metal ions. Interestingly,
no change of color was found either under the naked eye or under UV
light in the presence of other tested metal ions (Figure 2). A distinct UV–vis
spectrum was observed having a peak at 504 nm with a shoulder at 566
nm, and the three absorption peaks at 463, 494, and 531 nm were completely
diminished upon addition of only Cu2+ ions, while other
metal ions such as Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ showed negligible spectral changes (Figure 3a). This result indicates
that our designed chemosensor, APDI, can act as a potential candidate
for sensing Cu2+ ions under the naked eye in pure aqueous
medium.

Figure 2 Photographs of APDI solutions (10 μM) in the presence of
various metal ions (100 μM): (a) under visible light and (b)
under UV light excited at 365 nm.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of APDI (10 μM) upon
addition of respective metal ions (100 μM) were measured at
25 °C in a cell having path length of 10 mm in HEPES buffer (pH
7.4). (b) Dependence of the emission intensity factor (I/I0) was obtained by excitation of the
10 μM APDI fluorophore at the said excitation wavelength of
440 nm, slit of 5/5 nm, and path length of 10 mm in HEPES buffer (pH
7.4).

Emission intensity enhancement
(I/I0) (Figure 3b) was obtained by excitation
of the APDI fluorophore at the said
excitation wavelength of 440 nm during cation-selective chromogenic
chemosensing, through a competitive experiment (Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+).
The fluorescence enhancement factors (EFs) of APDI in the presence
of various metal ions can be seen in Figure 3b. In the presence of Cu2+ ions,
the fluorescence intensity of APDI decreased by over 250-fold, whereas
the EFs of Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and
Hg2+ were nearly equal to zero. APDI thus exhibits an obvious
“turn-off” fluorescence response and shows an extremely
high selectivity toward the Cu2+ in aqueous media. APDI
showed significant fluorescence quenching with Cu2+ only,
identifying it as an excellent turn-off sensor for Cu2+.

2.3 Complexation Titration of APDI with Cu2+ Ions
After 12 h of keeping the APDI solutions (10
μM) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) with Cu (II) ions, it has been
found that the color changes to pale pink, and these solutions have
shown fluorescence turn-off under UV light (excitation at 365 nm)
as the concentration of Cu2+ ions varies from lower to
higher (Figure S2). Afterward, we have
performed spectroscopic measurements such as UV–vis and PL
to observe the electronic changes in the ground state as well as in
the excited state of the newly formed APDI–Cu2+ complex
with respect to free APDI. Each solution was shaken well and made
homogeneous before taking any absorption or emission spectrum at 25
°C. Results showed a gradual decrease in absorption and emission
spectra as the concentration of copper ion increased. The absorption
bands of APDI at 463, 494, and 531 nm were diminished gradually, and
a new broad spectrum appeared at 504 nm with a shoulder at 566 nm,
which indicates that addition of Cu2+ produced a new ensemble
(Figure 4a). It has
further been seen that for free APDI, A0–0/A0–1 is 1.52, whereas in the
presence of 100 μM Cu2+ ions, the A0–0/A0–1 ratio
is 0.92, which supports the formation of aggregates.47,51 The binding of Cu2+ could also be traced by fluorescence
titration as strong quenching of the APDI emission at 547 nm (Figures 4b and S3) was observed upon gradual addition of the
metal ion. This change indicates that Cu2+ induced aggregation
of APDI by bringing two perylene moieties closer to favor π–π
stacking between them. Thus, APDI exhibits an obvious turn-off fluorescence
response and shows an extremely high selectivity toward Cu2+ in aqueous media.

Figure 4 (a) Absorption spectra of 10 μM APDI with different
concentrations
of Cu2+ at 25 °C, at a scan speed of 100 nm and path
length of 10 mm in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). (b) Emission spectra of
10 μM APDI with different concentrations of Cu2+ at
25 °C, λex = 440 nm, path length = 10 mm, and
slit = 5/5 nm in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4).

2.4 Application of the APDI–Cu2+ Ensemble
for Selective Sensing of PPi
As Cu2+ has binding
affinity toward PPi,52 we
have also tested our ensemble for the detection of PPi. A set of competitive
complexations with different concentrations of PPi was performed.
Surprisingly, the orange color of the solutions having concentrations
above 40 μM PPi reappeared under visible and yellow under UV
light, respectively (Figure 5). It is evidently clear that the absorption peak of APDI
redevelops at 531 and 494 nm for 0–0 and 0–1 electronic
transitions; on the other hand, the aggregation band at 566 nm decreased
(Figure 6a). These
results prove the disassembly of APDI–Cu2+ aggregates.
Subsequently, the emission intensity also became stronger upon gradual
increase of concentration of PPi (Figure 6b). Further addition of PPi above 100 μM
did not make any changes in absorption and emission spectra. The result
is due to the competitive binding of PPi with Cu2+, which
resulted in the disassembly of the APDI–Cu2+ complex,
which is responsible for reappearance of the original color of monomeric
APDI, resulting in the reappearance of the free APDI emission peak
at around 547 nm (Figure 6b). Benesi–Hilderbrand analysis (Figure S4) gives the apparent binding constant for the interaction
between APDI–Cu2+ and PPi, which was calculated
to be 8.9 × 105. The limit of detection for PPi was
calculated to be 1.08 × 10–7 M using the 3σ/S equation (Figure S5).

2.5 Specific and Selective Binding of APDI–Cu2+ Ensemble Exclusively with PPi over Other Common Anions
It is required to check the interferences of other common anions
to apply the developed APDI–Cu2+ probe for selective
detection of PPi. It has been found that the APDI–Cu2+ aggregate only binds with PPi and releases monomeric APDI in solution,
whereas it remains inactive toward other common anions. Figure S6 shows the selective recovery of the
color of monomeric APDI and fluorescence under UV light. The selectivity
toward the PPi anion only can be examined by performing fluorescence
measurements of APDI upon addition of common anions, viz., Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, NO2–, HPO42–, SO32–, OAC–, CO32–, F–, I–, and Br– under identical conditions.
The emission intensity increment (I/I0) of the APDI–Cu2+ ensemble vs different
anions at 547 nm (Figure 7a) clearly shows that the APDI–Cu2+ ensemble
selectively responds to PPi and does not exhibit any remarkable change
with other anions. Furthermore, the fluorescence response of the APDI–Cu2+ ensemble toward PPi was investigated in the presence of
excess of other anions. Figure 7b reveals the dramatic recovery of fluorescence when PPi was
added into the solution containing common anions. These results indicate
the selectivity of the present chemosensing ensemble probe APDI–Cu2+ for the detection of biologically important inorganic pyrophosphate.

fluorescence response after addition of 100 μM PPi; black bar:

wavelength: 440 nm; and emission wavelength: 547 nm.

2.6 Response of APDI–Cu2+ Probe
toward AMP, ADP, and ATP
As the in situ prepared APDI–Cu2+ ensemble exhibits good selectivity for PPi over general
anions, the studies were further extended to organic biorelevant molecules
bearing a phosphate moiety, viz., ATP, ADP, and AMP. Although many
reports exist in the literature that report detection of PPi, but
only few reports are there on selective recognition of PPi over AMP,
ADP, and ATP.15,23,53,54 To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report on a perylene diimide-based biosensor for the recognition
of PPi where AMP, ADP, and ATP do not interfere. The in situ prepared
APDI–Cu2+ ensemble was treated with 100 μM
ATP, ADP, AMP, and PPi, respectively. Interestingly, PPi showed instant
color change to orange, whereas other did not (Figure 8). The addition of PPi resulted in quick
recovery of fluorescence at conditions identical to those used for
free APDI, and absorption bands at 531 and 494 nm for 0–0 and
0–1 electronic transitions reappeared, whereas the aggregation
peak of APDI–Cu2+ at 566 nm was diminished (Figure 9a). Figure 5 shows the gradual increase
of luminescent properties of APDI on incremental addition of PPi to
the in situ formed APDI–Cu2+ aggregate. In contrast,
ADP, ATP, and AMP showed weaker response as compared to PPi (Figure 8). As observed in Figure 9b, when 100 μM
ATP and ADP were added to APDI–Cu2+ aggregates,
slight fluorescence enhancement was observed. The enhancement in the
presence of ADP is larger than that in the presence of ATP, while
AMP did not induce any detectable change of the fluorescence intensity
of the APDI–Cu2+ complex. It is also an interesting
result that the fluorescence enhancement caused by PPi is 4 times
larger than that caused by ATP or ADP (Figure S7b). Thus, the present developed novel biosensor based on
a water-soluble perylene diimide–Cu2+ aggregate
for PPi, which is a very important finding in the context of selectivity.
We have also tested the reversibility of APDI in the detection of
Cu2+ and PPi. As depicted by Figure 10, the fluorescence intensity of APDI alternatively
quenched and enhanced when alternatively Cu2+ and PPi were
added to the solution of APDI. This result proves the formation of
aggregate after addition of Cu2+ and disassembly of the
aggregate in the presence of PPi.

cell path length = 10 mm and measurement temperature = 25 °C.
In the case of fluorescence measurements, the excitation wavelength
was 440 nm.

2.7 Morphological Investigation of Aggregation
and Disaggregation Phenomena
Further evidence for aggregation
and disaggregation was obtained from the morphological changes of
APDI, APDI + Cu2+ aggregates, and APDI + Cu2+ in the presence of PPi by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM). The FESEM images (Figure 11) of pure APDI showed scattered flakelike structures
(Figure 11a). The
Cu2+ ion induced the formation of aggregation as shown
in Figure 11b. It
is clear from the images that APDI forms long fibers when Cu2+ is present in the solution, which finally forms an entangled network
structure in the dried state. The aggregated APDI + Cu2+ fibers are disaggregated rapidly in the presence of PPi, regaining
the flakelike structure of the APDI monomer (Figure 11c). The above results further confirm that
pure APDI aggregates in the presence of Cu2+ and disaggregates
on addition of PPi.

and (c) APDI–Cu2+ aggregates in the presence of
PPi [APDI (10 μM) + Cu2+ (100 μM) + PPi (100
μM)].

3 Conclusions
We have successfully developed a new biosensor based on a water-soluble
perylene diimide derivative, which can selectively detect PPi without
interferences from common anions, that is, AMP, ADP, and ATP. Our
finding suggests that water-soluble perylene diimide can act as a
multifunctional chemosensor for Cu2+ ions and PPi in pure
aqueous medium. By tracing the change of color, it distinguishes Cu2+ ion from other metal ions and PPi from common anions (even
from AMP, ADP, and ATP). Spectroscopic measurements show the formation
of aggregates of APDI with Cu (II) ions and disaggregation in the
presence of PPi anions, which has further been proved by morphological
investigations (FESEM). Our achievement is curated with the excellent
photochemical stability, chemical inertness toward oxidation, and
high quantum yield of the APDI probe. The one-step synthesis of the
probe with biocompatible amino acid functionalities is cost-effective
for large-scale production. Our low-cost analytical probe plays an
instrumental role in selective detection of PPi in the presence of
AMP, ADP, and ATP in 100% aqueous medium. The absence of any acidic/basic
condition in our method constitutes a platform for the exploitation
and applications in a biological environment including blood serum,
urine, etc. The APDI–Cu2+ ensemble probe showed
selective recognition of PPi with very low detection limit of 1.08
× 10–7 M in purely aqueous medium. Hence, development
of the colorimetric biosensor in an aqueous medium for pyrophosphate
has great potential in the fields of cell imaging and diagnosis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Instrumentation
Perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride and aspartic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received. Aspartic acid-functionalized perylene diimide (APDI)
was synthesized following previous reports.55,56 For all aqueous mixtures and for spectroscopic studies, water of
spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade
was used. HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) was used to prepare solutions for
spectroscopic measurements. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
at room temperature on 500 MHz spectrometers (Bruker). 1H NMR chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million
(ppm). 1H NMR shifts were referenced to the residual hydrogen
peak of D2O (4.60 ppm). Splitting patterns were denoted
as s (singlet) and br (broad). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
were recorded using KBr pellets of samples in an FTIR 8400S instrument
(Shimadzu). UV–vis spectra were measured using a Hitachi U2910
model-2J1-0013 UV–vis spectrophotometer at 25° C in a
cell having a path length of 10 mm and scan speed of 100 nm. The fluorescence
measurement was carried out using a cell having a path length of 10
mm in Hitachi F-4600 FLSPECTOROPHOTOMET model 5J2-0004 at an excitation
wavelength of 440 nm, excitation and emission slit of 5/5 nm, and
scan speed of 240 nm. The morphologies after aggregation and disaggregation
were observed by FESEM. A drop of the corresponding solution was casted
on a glass cover slip and then dried at room temperature. A JEOL,
JSM 6700F, instrument operating at 5 kV was used for imaging. Samples
were coated with platinum for 90 s to reduce surface potential.

4.2 Synthesis of APDI
Perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (750 mg, 8.15 mmol) was suspended in 50 mL of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and heated to 100 °C in a reflux apparatus.
Aspartic acid (8.67 g; 65.2 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of 8 M KOH
solution and added dropwise to the suspension. The mixture was stirred
at 100 °C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. The residue
was collected by filtration and washed with a mixture of DMSO and
water (2:1). Furthermore, the residue was dissolved in a minimum amount
of hot water and precipitated by the addition of acetone. Then, the
procedure was repeated four times. The solid material was then collected
by filtration, washed twice with acetone, and dried under vacuum to
get the desired product, yield: 74% (Scheme 1).

4.3 Preparation of Solutions for Spectroscopic
Measurements
4.3.1 Preparation of Solutions
for pH-Dependent
UV–Vis and Fluorescence Studies
The APDI stock solution
(20 mL, 1 mM) was prepared by dissolving 12.44 mg of APDI in 20 mL
of HPLC water. Then, 10 μM APDI solution was prepared by diluting
the stock solution with proper dilution.

4.3.2 Preparation
of Solutions for Study of Specific
Complexation of APDI with Cu2+
The stock solution
of Cu2+ ions (40 mM) was prepared by dissolving 152 mg
of Cu(II) nitrate salt in 100 mL of HEPES buffer. Then, different
concentration solutions of copper(II) ions such as 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μM along with 10 μM APDI were
made respectively with proper dilution. The solutions were shaken
well and kept for 12 h for the complete complexation to be occurred
before any measurements.

For different cations (Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Hg2+) other than the
copper(II) ion, stock solutions were made at 1 mM concentration in
HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and diluted as desired. As APDI moieties contain
K+ ions in the synthesized product, spectroscopic data
of Na+ and K+ ions have not been included although
measurements have been done for the control test.

4.3.3 Preparation of Solutions for APDI–Cu2+ Ensemble
for Selective Sensing of PPi
Main stock
solution was prepared as follows: 12 mM PPi was prepared by dissolving
41 mg of PPi in 10 mL of HEPES buffer aqueous solution (pH 7.4) and
used for PPi titration experiments. The APDI–Cu2+ ensemble was prepared by mixing 10 μM APDI with 100 μM
Cu2+ in HEPES buffer, and sufficient time (12 h) was given
to form a stable complex to produce 100% conversion of APDI to APDI–Cu2+ aggregates. The in situ formed ensemble was used for the
PPi detection experiment. Different concentrations of PPi solutions
(3 mL) such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 90, and 100 μM with
the in situ formed APDI–Cu2+ aggregate ([APDI] =
10 μM and [Cu2+] = 100 μM) in HEPES buffer
were prepared and kept for 12 h.

For all anions (Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, NO2–, HPO42–, SO32–, OAC–, CO32–, F–, I–, Br–, AMP, ADP, and ATP) other than PPi, stock
solutions were made at 1 mM concentration in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4),
which was diluted as desired for spectroscopic measurements.
