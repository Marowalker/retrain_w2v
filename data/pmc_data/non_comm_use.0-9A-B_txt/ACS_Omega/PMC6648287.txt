We first report an efficient combined
strategy that simultaneously
integrates copolymerization, doping, and molecular self-assembly for
the development of carbon-doping petal-like carbon nitride photocatalysts
using melamine (MA), cyanuric acid (CA), and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine
(TAP) as the starting precursors and water as the only green solvent.
The morphology, textural, optical, and electronic properties of carbon
nitride could be engineered by rationally manipulating the doping
content of TAP. In the process of molecular self-assembly, TAP can
insert the aggregate edge easily according to the results of density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. The edge-termination effect
of TAP made it easier for the modified carbon nitride materials to
form petal-like nanosheets with porous structures and large BET surface
areas. In addition, the incorporation of TAP also contributed to tuning
the electronic band structures of carbon nitrides and enhancing the
separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The as-prepared
materials exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities in the degradation
of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) and rhodamine B (RhB). This
work may not only offer universally powerful and stable photocatalysts
for applications but also develop a new combined strategy to fabricate
efficient photocatalysts in a facile and green way.

Introduction
Semiconductor-based
photocatalysis, as a feasible and green technology
in which the inexhaustible and clean solar energy can be harvested
and utilized, has gained considerable attention for addressing the
increasing challenges in energy shortage and environmental pollution.1 As we all know, it is the key factor to fabricate
highly efficient and enough robust photocatalysts to carry out numerous
catalytic reactions. Since the pioneering work in 2009 for visible-light
photocatalytic water splitting, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been considered as the next generation
photocatalyst and also a step to achieve sustainability for artificial
photosynthesis and environmental remediation.2 As a metal-free polymeric photocatalyst, g-C3N4 exhibits lots of excellent features, such as facile synthesis, high
chemical and thermal stability, abundant and inexpensive building
elements, proper electronic band structure for visible-light-responsive
flexible supramolecular networks for fine-tuning material properties,
and so on.3 However, the bulk g-C3N4 material prepared by direct polycondensation from nitrogen-rich
precursors generally yields only rather disorganized textures with
low surface areas as well as less active sites, which significantly
restrict its applications.4 Thus, considerable
and continuing efforts have been devoted to improve the activity of
g-C3N4, such as doping with heteroatoms,5 constructing heterostructures,6 fabricating copolymers,7 thermal
etching,8 cocatalyst loading,9 and so on. In particular, doping carbon nitride
with nonmetal elements (such as P, N, Br, O, C, B, I, S, and so on)
has been regarded as one efficient strategy for improving the photocatalytic
activity of g-C3N4, which allows researchers
to engineer the molecular and electronic structure and finally to
enhance optical absorption and accelerate charge mobility without
destroying the major construction and architecture of the g-C3N4 polymer.10 Mostly,
the effect of heteroatom doping on the photocatalytic performance
of g-C3N4 is affected by the prepared methods
as well as the selected precursors. However, it is difficult to control
heteroatoms in the particular site of the network of g-C3N4. Besides, the process of doping often contains the
mixing of different precursors through physical methods, such as mechanical
stirring or grinding, which cannot be controlled with uniform dopant
distribution to the carbon nitride framework. Therefore, it remains
a great challenge to realize efficient and precise control of the
heteroatom in the framework of g-C3N4 for fine-tuning
of its intrinsic electronic structure and thus its photocatalytic
property.

Molecular self-assembly of monomers through noncovalent
interactions
is in fact a promising route for atomically precise fabrication of
materials with desired properties through the bottom-up approach.11 The cyanuric acid–melamine (CM) complex
is one of the best known molecular aggregates consisting of a hydrogen
bond, which is powerful to control molecular self-assembly due to
its reversibility, specificity, and directionality.12 Recently, the exploitation of CM hydrogen-bonded complexes
and other derivatives opens new opportunities for the research of
carbon nitride.1b Shalom et al. and other
researchers have reported the CM-derived carbon nitride exhibited
well-organize morphology, hollow structure, high surface area, and
superior photocatalytic activities.1b,11a,12b,13 2,4,6-Triaminopyrimidine
(TAP) has a molecular structure similar to melamine (MA). Ho et al.
have successfully prepared C-doped g-C3N4 for
precise substitution of nitrogen in the skeleton of tri-s-triazine with carbon through copolymerization of MA and TAP,10g while it is not easy to mix uniformly in an
agate mortar in the molecular level. Bhunia and co-workers reported
a triazine-based carbon nitride material with different C/N ratios
by varying the monomer composition ratio between MA and TAP.14 However it is time-consuming and process-inefficient,
and also it requires environmentally hazardous reagents. These pioneering
works inspire us to develop new strategy to synthesize modified carbon
nitride photocatalysts, which may integrate carbon doping, molecular
assembly, and copolymerization with three different monomers, thus
further enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

In this study,
we have first developed a simple, new, efficient,
and green strategy to prepare modified carbon nitride materials from
three common precursor molecules, namely, MA, TAP, and CA, and only
water used as a green solvent, as shown in Figure 1. First, TAP and MA that have similar molecular
structures of a six-membered aromatic heterocycle were mixed uniformly
and sufficiently in water, and meanwhile, CA was solved in water.
After mixing the above two solutions, MA, TAP, and CA supramolecular
aggregates (MTC) were formed through molecular self-assembly via intermolecular
hydrogen bonds. The structures of supramolecular aggregates were first
studied by using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
After polycondensation of the MTC supramolecular aggregates, TAP was
successfully copolymerized into the network of carbon nitride for
precise substitution of nitrogen in the skeleton of tri-s-triazine with carbon. The obtained modified carbon nitrides exhibited
excellent photocatalytic activities in the degradation of tetracycline
hydrochloride (TC-HCl) and rhodamine B (RhB). This design strategy
is a smart and efficient way to realize the fine-tuning of intrinsic
structures and electronic properties and consequently photocatalytic
properties of carbon nitride. Also it is anticipated that this metal-free
photocatalyst can be a promising candidate for the potential application
for the water purification field.

carbon nitride materials

Results and Discussion
Formation of MTC Supramolecular
Aggregates and the Synthesis
of Carbon Nitrides
TAP has a molecular structure similar
to MA. The only difference in the molecular structure is that MA has
a 1,3,5-triazine skeleton (C3N3), whereas the
TAP molecule consists of pyrimidine with two nitrogen atoms in the
ring (C4N2) (as shown in Figure 1). Based on the high similarity between the
molecular structures of MA and TAP, we think that TAP may be a substitute
to precursor MA to form supramolecular aggregates with CA.

In
order to identify our hypothesis, the optimized structures and complexation
energies (Ecomp.’s) of three aggregate
lattice fragments were obtained by DFT calculations. As depicted in Figure 2, complex A, as the
lattice fragment of the supramolecular aggregates of MA and CA, has
the lowest complexation energy of −98.1 kcal mol–1. According to the possible doped sites of TAP, two typical lattice
fragments of the supramolecular aggregates of MA, TAP, and CA were
taken into account, that is,, complexes B and C, in which TAP occupies
the edge and the middle of the aggregates, respectively. The calculated
results indicated that the Ecomp. of complex
B is very close to that of complex A, differing by only 1 kcal mol–1. The Ecomp. of complex
C, however, is much higher (12.8 kcal mol–1) than
that of complex A, mainly attributed to the partial breakage of the
intermolecular hydrogen bonds in complex C. Therefore, it can be readily
concluded that TAP can insert the aggregate edge easily and partly
substitute precursor MA to form supramolecular aggregates with CA.

Figure 2 Schematics
of optimized MTC supramolecular aggregate structures
by DFT (Ecomp.’s, the complexation
energies based on BSSE correction).

The results of theoretical calculation showed that MA, TAP,
and
CA can form MTC supramolecular aggregates. Meanwhile, as can be seen
from Figure 1, the
MA and TAP could be dissolved in water at 90 °C and CA could
also be dissolved in water at 90 °C, but after mixing the two
solutions, white precipitates could be found. So the experimental
results further proved that MA, TAP, and CA can form MTC aggregates.

The obtained MTC aggregates were calcined at 550 °C for 4
h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under an
nitrogen atmosphere. With the increase of TAP, the color of carbon
nitride becomes deeper and 0.01TAP-CM, 0.03TAP-CM, and 0.05TAP-CM
become very fluffy (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

Structure and Morphology Characterization
Morphological
characteristics of the different materials were investigated by SEM
and TEM. As illustrated in Figure 3, the CN sample exhibits aggregated morphology consisting
of block large particles and no porosity is observed on the surface
(Figure 3a), which
is the typical structure characteristic of g-C3N4 synthesized by direct thermal polymerization.15 Far different from CN, all xTAP-CM materials
exhibit porous, loose, curve, and homogeneous morphology composed
of nanosheets (Figure 3b–f). Thanks to many gas bubbles produced during thermal condensation
under high temperature and the edge-termination effect of TAP, all xTAP-CM materials exhibit porous and loose morphology composed
of nanosheets. In addition, the atmosphere originated from the interior
of the reaction system, and the condition of polycondensation was
more homogeneous than common thermal condensation, so we obtained
regular and homogeneous morphology.15 Ho
et al. have reported the g-C3N4 layer self-organized
into nanotubes with a wrinkled appearance when the TAP was incorporated.10g So the curve morphology of xTAP-CM materials is in agreement with Ho et al.’s results
and also reveals the successful integration of TAP rings into the
CN network again. Moreover, we can find the configuration of the curve
structure is dependent on the TAP contents. For 0.01TAP, the carbon
nitride displays a loose stacked structure and layers were partially
curved (Figure 3c).
When the TAP content was increased to 0.03 or 0.05, the layers of
carbon nitride sufficiently assembled into a curve structure and exhibited
homogeneous petal-like morphology with porous texture (Figure 3d,e). Further increasing TAP
content to 0.07, the layers of carbon nitride become smaller and begin
to collapse or destroy (Figure 3f). The differences of morphology further confirm the successful
incorporation of TAP. Furthermore, the basic sheet edge tends to bend,
which may be caused as a result of minimizing the surface energy of
the sheet and porous structure formation.16 Obviously, the morphology of the carbon nitride could be modified
by rationally manipulating the doping content of TAP, which is a facile
way to tune the microstructures. This result is supplemented by TEM
images for CN and 0.03TAP-CM (Figure 3g,h). Clearly, the pristine CN exhibits the compact
stacking of layered sheet morphology (Figure 3g) that changes to a thin, curve, silk-like
nanostructure (Figure 3h) after TAP doping.

(d),
0.05TAP-CM (e), and 0.07TAP-CM (f); TEM images for CN (g) and 0.03TAP-CM
(h).

The XRD patterns of the different
materials are displayed in Figure 4a,b. The xTAP-CM materials show distinctively
different XRD patterns
from CN. CN gives two typical diffraction peaks at around 13.0 and
27.2° as reported previously,2c which
are attributed to the in-plane structural packing motif and the interlayer
stacking of aromatic systems, respectively. Impressively, the two
obvious peaks become very weak in the xTAP-CM, which
demonstrate structure defects and the absence of long-range order
in the atomic arrangements.16,17 We may infer the multiple
effects of too many gas bubbles produced during thermal condensation
significantly disrupted the long-range atomic order in directions
both perpendicular and parallel to layers, which agrees with the SEM
results. Notably, 0.07TAP-CM exhibits the weakest peaks, which may
be ascribed to the collapsed or destroyed structures. In addition,
the main peak displays a slight shift to higher angles from 27.2 to
27.5°, corresponding to a reduction in the stacking distance
of layers.18

Figure 4 (a,b) XRD patterns of
the different samples. (c,d) FTIR spectra
of the different samples.

The microstructures of the different materials were further
characterized
by FTIR technology to investigate the effect of TAP incorporation.
As shown in Figure 4c,d, all FTIR spectra of the as-prepared samples showed similar characteristic
vibrational peaks. The multiple bands in the range from about 1230
to 1650 cm–1 correspond to the stretching modes
of typical aromatic C–N heterocycles.10g,18 The peak at approximately 808 cm–1 is assigned
to the characteristic breathing mode of tri-s-triazine
units.19 The broad bands located in the
range from 3000 to 3650 cm–1 originate from the
stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H bonds, associated
with uncondensed amino groups (−NH2 or −NH
groups) and adsorbed H2O molecules.18−20 It is obvious
that the characteristic absorbance for the C–N heterocycles
remained almost unchanged after incorporating with TAP. These results
suggest that the TAP incorporation did not severely alter the core
chemical skeleton of carbon nitride. However, the evident enhanced
absorption in 3000 to 3650 cm–1 can be considered
as an indicator of modified carbon nitride materials with enlarged
open-up surfaces and more uncondensed amino groups.15 In addition, the peak at ∼1380 cm–1 becomes obviously enhanced compared to CN, which may be the influence
of TAP incorporated to the supramolecular complex. Furthermore, the
peak at ∼808 cm–1 is another typical characteristic
peak of the heptazine unit, and we can find that the peaks for modified
g-C3N4 materials slightly shift from 808 to
814 cm–1 by the introduction of TAP.

The compositions
and surface chemical states of the different samples
were studied by XPS to determine the effect of TAP incorporation on
the chemical skeleton of carbon nitride. In the XPS survey spectra
(Figure S2, Supporting Information), we
can find three main peaks at ∼288, 398, and 532 eV, which belong
to the C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s signals, respectively. The very weak O
1s peak may be assigned to the absorbed H2O or O2 on the surface of the samples.21 As shown
in Table 1, the C/N
molar ratios increased when TAP content increased, which is consistent
with the result of the substitution of partial N atoms by C atoms
in the framework of carbon nitride when MA was substituted by TAP.
The chemical groups and bonding characteristics were further confirmed
by the high-resolution C 1s (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and N 1s spectra (Figure 5a–f). The C 1s spectra could be peak-fitted
into four components: the main one located at ∼288.3 eV was
attributed to sp2-hybridized C from the s-triazine heterocycle, whereas the wide component at ∼293.5
eV could be ascribed to its π → π* satellite band;
the peak with a low intensity at ∼286.3 eV was related to the
C–NHx, and the weak component at
∼284.8 eV was associated with surface carbon impurities.22 However, the binding energy of xTAP-CM materials for the C 1s XPS at 288.3 eV shifted slightly to
lower energy (288.2 eV), and the peak at 286.3 eV reversely shifted
to higher energy (286.9 eV) when TAP incorporation increased, which
are well consistent with the reported literature.10g The N 1s XPS spectra (Figure 5a–f) can be fitted into four peaks.
The main component (∼398.7 eV) corresponded to sp2-hybridized N from the heterocycle and was also accompanied by a
wide π → π* satellite band at 404.4 eV. The peaks
at 400.0 and 401.1 eV corresponded to the tertiary N in the form of
N(−C)3 and uncondensed amino functional groups (NH2 or NH),10g,16 respectively. The absorption
associated with different nitrogen moieties could identify the defect
types to some degree, as well as the uncondensed amino groups.15,23 N-associated species were quantified using deconvoluted N 1s spectra
(Table 1). A higher
ratio of NHx/N(−C)3 demonstrates
a smaller polymerization degree, meanwhile more uncondensed amino
groups. It can be found that xTAP-CM materials all
show larger values of NHx/N(−C)3. The phenomena can be attributed to the edge-termination
effect of TAP, which results in the low degree of polymerization and
large amount of amino groups. The XPS results are consistent with
the SEM, XRD, and FTIR results.

The pore structures and BET surface areas of the different
samples
were obtained by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements.
As shown in Figure 6a, xTAP-CM materials exhibit type IV isotherms with
extremely high adsorption capacities in the high relative pressure
(P/P0: from 0.8 to 1),
indicating the presence of abundant mesopores and macropores.4,24 As compared to bulk CN, the BET surface areas of xTAP-CM materials present an obvious increase. Especially, the BET
surface area of 0.03TAP-CM is calculated to be 95 m2 g–1, which is more than 15 times that of CN (6 m2 g–1). The large BET surface areas of xTAP-CM materials can be attributed to the edge-termination
effect of TAP as well as the large amount of bubbles of polycondensation.
The BET surface areas of 0.05TAP-CM and 0.07TAP-CM are calculated
to be 84 and 41 m2 g–1, respectively.
It can be seen that with the increase of TAP, the BET surface area
decreased, which may be due to too much incorporation of TAP and the
petal-like microstructure that began to collapse or destroy. The BET
results are consistent with the SEM results. To further analyze the
pore structures of xTAP-CM materials, pore size distribution
(PSD) plots were obtained using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. Correspondingly, xTAP-CM materials
possess much larger pore volumes than CN (Figure 6b). The PSD curves of xTAP-CM
materials have a narrow distribution from about 2 to 4 nm and a broad
distribution from about 20 to 180 nm, while that of CN shows negligible
peaks. Notably, the PSD curve of 0.07TAP-CM exhibits a negligible
peak in the region from 20 to 180 nm, which may be also attributed
to too much incorporation of TAP and the petal-like microstructure
that began to collapse or destroy. The large BET surface area and
pore volume could provide more reactive sites and more edge structures,
which may effectively adsorb more reactants and which are conducive
to mass transfer and charge carrier transfer during the photocatalytic
process.4,15

different samples. (b) BJH pore size distribution curves of the different
samples.

Optical and Electronic
Properties
We studied the optical
properties of the different samples by solid-state UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Figure 7a,b). As shown in Figure 7a,b, the UV–vis DRS spectra indicate
that the absorption edges of xTAP-CM materials display
a slight red shift along with a TAP increase, which was consistent
with the results reported in the previous literature.10g This result further confirms the successful
incorporation of TAP, and the electronic structure of carbon nitride
is remarkably modified. The energy band gaps of the different samples
can be determined from the intercept of the tangents to the plots
of (αhυ)2 versus hυ.25 As presented in Figure 7c, we can obtain the band gaps
of different samples. Overall, the xTAP-CM materials
demonstrate narrower band gaps than the CN sample. Furthermore, XPS
valence band (VB XPS) spectra were analyzed to investigate the band
edges of all the different samples (Figure 7d). According to the results of band gaps
and valence band, the electronic band structures of xTAP-CM materials can be schemed (as shown in Figure 7e). It can be seen that the electronic band
structures of xTAP-CM materials could be tuned by
manipulating the doping content of TAP. From 0.01TAP-CM to 0.07TAP-CM,
the band gaps were gradually reduced. A possible reason is the increasing
proportion of TAP; the contributions of substituted carbon would decrease
the balances of π-conjugated electrons on the triazine rings
and accordingly reduced the band gaps on the large doping compounds
as observed in the UV–vis absorption spectra.10g The reduction of band gap energy is beneficial to harvest
solar light. Aside from an appropriate band gap, the matching of CB
and VB levels of the semiconductor photocatalyst with the redox potential
of photocatalytic reaction is also important.26 It can be seen that 0.03TAP-CM has the lowest CB value, which may
indicate strongest reduction ability.15

plots and band gap energy estimations; inset shows the photograph

samples. (e) Schematic band structures of the different samples.

We further studied the optical
properties of pristine CN and modified
carbon nitride 0.03TAP-CM by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).
As shown in Figure 8a, the excitation spectra were monitored at room temperature with
an excitation wavelength of 389 nm and are matched well with UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra. The emission peak of modified carbon
nitride shifts to a higher intensity with the addition of TAP. Generally,
carbon nitride with high photocatalytic activity should have a lower
fluorescence intensity, but there is an exception to the PL intensity
when the carbon nitride has a nanosheet structure.27 So the increase of the PL intensity for the modified 0.03TAP-CM
material can be attributed to its nanosheet structures. The PL results
are consistent with the SEM results. We also measured the PL spectra
of 0.01TAP-CM, 0.05TAP-CM, and 0.07TAP-CM (Figure S4, Supporting Information). It can be seen that, with an increasing
amount of TAP added, the fluorescence intensities of 0.01TAP-CM, 0.03TAP-CM,
and 0.05TAP-CM gradually increase. It may be due to the more defects
produced with the increasing amount of TAP added. More defects appear
resulting in an increase in radiation recombination and gradually
stronger fluorescence intensity.28 However,
the fluorescence intensity of 0.07TAP-CM obviously decreases. It may
be due to the too much incorporation of TAP and nanosheet structures
that began to collapse or destroy.

(b) EIS plots of the CN
and 0.03TAP-CM; inset shows the transient photocurrent responses of
the CN and 0.03TAP-CM.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a method
to explain
the electron-transfer efficiency at the electrodes. Generally speaking,
the relative size of the arc radius on Nyquist plots corresponds to
charge transfer resistance in the study of photocatalysis. The 0.03TAP-CM
photocatalyst exhibits the smaller arc radius, implying its lower
charge-transfer resistance (as shown in Figure 8b). This result is supplemented by transient
photocurrent response measurements that show an enhancement in the
current density of 0.03TAP-CM over CN. These results indicate 0.03TAP-CM
has less recombination and more efficient separation of photogenerated
h+/e– pairs, and such photoelectrochemical
properties are very beneficial for photocatalysis. The more efficient
separation of photogenerated h+/e– pairs
can be attributed to the incorporation of TAP, which caused the carbon
doping in the carbon nitride materials.10g

Photocatalytic Activities
In order to estimate the
potential capabilities of wastewater treatment, the photocatalytic
activities of the as-prepared samples were evaluated via the degradation
of aqueous TC-HCl and RhB under light irradiation. As shown in Figure 9a, the photolysis
of TC-HCl under the same experimental conditions without the catalyst
indicated that TC-HCl was stable under irradiation after 30 min. For
comparison, only about 50% of TC-HCl was degraded in the presence
of the CN after 30 min. On the contrary, the photocatalytic activities
for xTAP-CM materials were very satisfactory. The
photodegradation rates increase with the addition of TAP content in
the supramolecular complex and then decrease. Especially for 0.03TAP-CM,
when the irradiation time reached only 20 min, more than 95% of TC-HCl
was degraded. In order to confirm the universality of the catalyst,
we studied the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB), which
was a common organic dye. The results also verified the excellent
ability of the 0.03TAP-CM material to remove organic pollution in
water (Figure 9b).
The results demonstrated that the well-defined petal-like microstructure
was advantageous to improve its photocatalytic activity.

degradation of TC-HCl. (b) Photocatalytic degradation

using 0.03TAP-CM (20 min irradiation). (d) Trapping experiment of
the active species for the degradation of TC-HCl over the 0.03TAP-CM.

The stability of a photocatalyst
is also very important for its
practical application. The 0.03TAP-CM sample was tested through five
consecutive trials (only irradiation for 20 min) to test the reusability
and stability (Figure 9c). There is hardly any loss of activity in the photocatalytic performance
of 0.03TAP-CM with the reaction time prolonged. The mass loss of catalyst
0.03TAP-CM in recycling experiments may be the major factor affecting
the photocatalyst reactivation.15 Therefore,
0.03TAP-CM can be regarded as a stable high-performance photocatalyst
for photodegrading organic pollutants, possessing great prospects
in environmental protection.

Photocatalytic Mechanism
It is well
known that photogenerated
holes (h+), superoxide radical (·O2–), and hydroxyl radical (·OH) are three typical active species for the degradation of pollutants.
In order to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism of 0.03TAP-CM
and probe the role of various active species, the trapping experiments
were conducted. In this study, EDTA-2Na, BQ, and IPA were employed
as the scavengers for h+, ·O2–, and ·OH, respectively.23 As stated in Figure 9d, the photocatalytic activity of 0.03TAP-CM
was greatly suppressed by the addition of BQ, which indicated that ·O2– is the main active species
in the photocatalytic reaction. Conversely, the photocatalytic efficiency
did not change significantly by introduction of IPA and EDTA-2Na,
revealing that the ·OH and h+ did not play
an important role in the degradation. In conclusion, ·O2– is the major reactive species for
the degradation of TC-HCl on the 0.03TAP-CM sample.

According
to the above experimental results, the mechanism for photocatalytic
degradation is proposed (Figure 10). The enhanced photocatalytic performance of 0.03TAP-CM
demonstrated above can be explained as the synergistic effects of
large BET surface area, porous structure, petal-like morphology, and
carbon doping. First, benefiting from the edge-termination effect
of TAP as well as the large amount of bubbles in the polycondensation,
all the xTAP-CM materials demonstrate large surface
areas and porous structures (especially for 0.03TAP-CM), which could
provide more reactive sites and more edge structures, and may effectively
adsorb more reactants.4 Furthermore, the
well-defined and homogeneous petal-like structure could efficiently
enhance the reflection and scattering of light in the reaction system,
which is in favor of making full use of the light. Third, carbon doping
could efficiently enhance the separation of photogenerated h+/e– pairs. Finally, precise control of doping carbon
atoms into the skeleton structure of carbon nitride finely tunes its
intrinsic electronic properties. 0.03TAP-CM has the lowest CB value
and strongest reduction ability, which is a benefit to produce more ·O2– active species.

mechanism of photocatalytic process on 0.03TAP-CM photocatalyst

Conclusions
To conclude, the modified and efficient
carbon nitride materials
were synthesized by a facile and green method using MA, CA, and TAP
as the starting precursors and water as the green solvent. MA, CA,
and TAP could form the self-assembly aggregates in water. TAP can
insert the aggregate edge easily according to the results of DFT calculations.
The morphology, textural, optical, and electronic features of carbon
nitride could be modified by rationally manipulating the doping content
of TAP. Compared to the common carbon nitride, the optimal modified
carbon nitride 0.03TAP-CM had homogeneous petal-like morphology, porous
nanostructure, larger BET surface area, more appropriate electronic
band structure, and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated
carriers. 0.03TAP-CM exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities
in the degradation of TC-HCl and RhB. The enhanced photocatalytic
activities may be attributed to the edge-termination effect and incorporation
of TAP. Overall, this work demonstrates a facile and green preparation
strategy that simultaneously integrates copolymerization, doping,
and molecular self-assembly. Meanwhile, the new as-prepared photocatalysts, xTAP-CM materials (especially 0.03TAP-CM), demonstrate excellent
photocatalytic performances and hold great promise in practical applications
of utilizing solar energy for environmental remedy.

Experimental
Section
Material Preparation
The common g-C3N4 sample was prepared by a previously reported thermal polymerization
method.21b In a typical procedure, the
material was synthesized by heating 2.5 g of MA in a semiclosed quartz
crucible under N2 gas flow to 550 °C for 4 h at a
heating rate of 5 °C min–1 and then cooled
to room temperature. The product was collected and ground into powder
and denoted as CN.

The modified carbon nitride materials were
prepared by a new and green approach. First, MA and TAP with different
amount ratios of 2.5 – x:x (x = 0, 0.0250, 0.0750, 0.1250, 0.1750, and the
total amount remained 2.5 g) were first dissolved and mixed in 100
mL of deionized water under stirring at 90 °C. At the same time,
2.5 g of CA was dissolved in another 100 mL of deionized water under
stirring at 90 °C. After complete dissolution, the above solutions
were mixed together to give white precipitates. Subsequently, the
mixtures were filtered and washed with water. The resulting precipitates
were dried at 60 °C in an oven and calcined at 550 °C for
4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under
a nitrogen atmosphere. When x = 0, the corresponding
sample was denoted as CM due to the sample only involving two kinds
of precursors (CA and MA). When different amounts of TAP were introduced
into the CA and MA system, the resulting samples were labeled xTAP-CM (x denotes the ratio of TAP/(MA
+ TAP), x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07).

Material Characterization
The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer model 2000 FTIR spectrophotometer.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax/Ultima
IV diffractometer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were
obtained on a FEI QUANTA F250 scanning electron microscope. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30
instrument. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were carried out on an ESCALAB 250 Xi with a high-performance Al monochromatic
source (hυ = 1486.6 eV, 150 W). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas were calculated from N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms collected at 77 K using Quantachrome Instruments version
3.0. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a
Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as the reference
sample. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on an EI
FLS980 at room temperature with excitation at 389 nm. The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out and the transient photocurrent
responses were obtained, both on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660D,
Shanghai Chenhua Apparatus Co., Ltd.) by using a three-electrode model
in which the working electrodes of CN and 0.03TAP-CM were deposited
on ITO conductive glass. A Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode,
and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was the reference electrode. A 300
W Xe lamp was used as a light source. The working electrode was prepared
according to the following procedure: 5 mg of photocatalyst and 10
μL of Nafion solution (5 wt %) were dispersed in 1000 μL
water/ethanol mixed solvent (3:1 v/v) by 60 min sonication to make
slurry. Then, 40 μL of the slurry was dropped onto the ITO conductive
glass with an effective working area of 1 cm2 and then
dried in air.

Calculation Methods
All DFT calculations
presented
here were carried out with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. Based
on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), geometric
structures for the lattice fragments were optimized in aqueous solution
using the dispersion corrected B3LYP-D3 theory of level in conjunction
with the standard 6-31 + G(d) basis set. The computational methods
chosen have been tested extensively and proven to be reliable in solving
many biochemical problems.29 Vibrational
frequency calculations were performed to confirm the stationary point
as a minimum with all positive frequencies. The complexation energies
of the lattice fragments were calculated through basis set superposition
error (BSSE) correction. The dielectric constant used in the calculations
was ε = 78.4 for water.

Photocatalytic Activity
Measurement
The photocatalytic
activities of the synthesized samples were evaluated by photodegradation
of TC-HCl and RhB at ambient temperature in air. The UV–visible
light was provided by a 70 W metal halide, which was often used in
photocatalysis conveniently.15,30 In a typical photocatalytic
experiment, 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed into 50 mL of TC-HCl
aqueous solution (20 mg/L) at room temperature. Prior to irradiation,
the mixed suspension was first sonicated for 10 min and then magnetically
stirred for 20 min in the dark to obtain an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. At certain time intervals of irradiation, about 3 mL
aliquots were taken out from the reaction system and centrifuged to
remove the photocatalyst powders. The concentration of the remaining
TC-HCl was determined on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. The relative
concentration (C/C0)
of the TC-HCl solution was calculated at 357 nm. C0 and C are the concentrations of TC-HCl
at the beginning and at time t, respectively. The
photocatalytic activities of different samples on the decomposition
of RhB aqueous solution (10 mg/L) were also studied under similar
conditions.

The stability of 0.03TAP-CM was checked using the
recyclability studies. After each cycle, the catalyst was collected
by centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and dried. The recovered
catalyst was then directly used for the next cycle of photocatalytic
degradation of TC-HCl as stated above.

Active Species Detection
The reactive species in the
photodegradation of TC-HCl were detected using in situ trapping experiments.
The detection process was similar to the photodegradation experimental
process except for the addition of scavengers. Three different scavengers,
disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA-2Na, hole scavenger), p-benzoquinone (BQ, ·O2– radical scavenger), and isopropanol (IPA, ·OH radical
scavenger), were added to the TC-HCl solution prior to illumination
in three separate photodegradation systems.23
