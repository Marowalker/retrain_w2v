Understanding the dynamic processes
of CO2 capture in
biosystems is important because of the great effect CO2 has on the carbon cycle, human health, the global climate, and living
environments. After years of multidisciplinary studies, researchers
have gained only basic mechanistic knowledge about how enzymes or
protein-aggregates capture and deliver CO2, a process involving
reversible bonding of CO2 with basic amino acid residues.
However, vital mechanistic details of how the activated basic residues
within these enzymes or protein-aggregates are initially formed, a
crucial step for CO2 capture, are still lacking. Herein,
we designed specific molecules, i.e., oxazolidines, which are able
to reversibly change their alkalinity via ultrafast isomerizations.
Serving as so-called transient bases, these oxazolidines mimic the
activated/deactivated states of enzymes or protein-aggregates responsible
for dynamic CO2 capture/release. A detailed mechanism for
CO2 capture, which involves dynamic covalent bonding and
multimolecular cooperative interactions among functional groups that
occur with the help of a polyhydroxyl environment, is demonstrated
by UV−vis and multiple NMR spectroscopies as well as theoretical
calculations. Using suitable oxazolidine transient bases, applications
for visual CO2 detection under different detection limit
requirements were also developed. Insights for further understanding
the process of dynamic CO2 capture in biosystems are also
discussed. This oxazolidine-inspired biomimetic CO2 capture
serves as a platform for the future development of additional biomimicking
systems, as well as offers unique perspectives for other complicated
life processes.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2), as an indispensable component
of the atmosphere,1 plays important roles
in the carbon cycle of the biosphere2 and
has huge impacts on the global climate and human health.3,4 It is involved in many vital biological processes, such as photosynthesis,5 respiration,6 CO2 transport,7 and so on. Many detailed
studies8−10 on CO2 are those that involve bioreactions
and processes, especially with respect to how CO2 is fixed
by enzymes and protein-aggregates found in cells. These investigations
have revealed several key features that have led to a better understanding
of intricate life processes. One particularly important process11,12 is the equilibrium between the noncarbamylated and carbamylated
forms of the enzyme or protein, which is a key step for biotransformations
involving CO2. A well-known example is the capture of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is then converted to a carbamate
(RNHCOOH) by the activated Lys201ε-NH2 residue of
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) during the Calvin
cycle in plants10,13 (Scheme 1a). Another example of carbamylation involves
hemoglobin (Hb), in which CO2 (proportion of 7%) is converted
to carbamino-hemoglobin in blood by activated valyl-amine found in
the β-chain of hemoglobin (or myohemoglobin) during respiration14 (Scheme 1b). Both RuBisCO and Hb require the formation of free-base
amine groups in their related amino acid residues to be activated
for CO2 capture. The resulting amines of these residues
are alkaline enough to facilitate carboxylation with CO2. Nearby cations bound-up in the protein, such as Mg2+ or Fe2+, further stabilize the negative charge from the
resulting carbamate anion (Scheme 1c). How the alkali residues are activated and deactivated
for continuous and repetitive CO2 capture and release during
these enzymatic processes, however, has not been understood completely
yet. One convincing possible explanation for the reversible change
in alkalinity is that the activation and deactivation of RuBisCO or
Hb result in pH changes (from 7 to 9) of their local microenvironments.12,13 Nevertheless, many features or functions15−17 for macromolecules
seem to be brought about by thermodynamic alteration of their molecular
conformations (e.g., molecular vibration, rotation) or configurations
(e.g., heterolytic cleavage of chemical bonds) for self-adaption or
survival needs. Alkalinity changes among functional subunits of metabolic
protein-aggregates (i.e., RuBisCO and Hb) may also be caused by thermodynamically
adjusting their local structural configurations or conformations in
response to an external stimulus (e.g., an increase in CO2 concentration), rather than a pH change in its environment. However,
this bold conjecture is difficult to prove directly by current characterization
techniques due to the complicated three-dimensional dynamic structures/conformations
and behaviors for these protein-aggregates.

(d) Molecular switches studied herein that can
potentially form transient bases.

We became
motivated by the idea that the essential principles of
all of the molecular transformations should be universal, regardless
of whether they are chemical or biochemical processes, that is, the
underlying working principles deduced from simplified biomimetic reactions
employing small organic molecules should be the same as those of large
biomolecules (e.g., proteins and nucleic acids). This type of thinking
might provide new trains of thought for the development of molecular
bionics. Small molecules characterized by fleeting reversible alkalinity
might display similar behaviors as those of biological systems nature
uses for CO2 capture by means of a dynamic addition reaction.
To verify this hypothesis, as well as to construct a simple platform
for CO2 capture relying on dynamic covalent bonding, we
went about designing some simple molecules that are able to reversibly
change their alkalinity by way of ultrafast isomerization reactions.
For the sake of discussion, herein we refer to molecules that possess
this property of reversible alkalinity as “transient bases”.
This momentary basicity is a result of the rapid, highly reversible,
and repeated structural variations that occur at thermodynamic equilibrium,
where one isomer possesses a particularly potent basic functionality.
Numerous studies with chloroplasts and leaves have shown that a greater
proportion of RuBisCO in the active form exists in response to a higher
light intensity. Thus, we envision that photochromic molecules, such
as spiropyrans,18 oxazines,19 and oxazolidines,20,21 which can
undergo reversible isomerization between a ring-closed form (RCF)
and a ring-open form (ROF) accompanied by obvious changes in color,
might be ideal transient bases for developing simplified platforms
for exploration of biomimetic CO2 capture (Scheme 1d). The reasons for this are
threefold: (i) the quick dynamic equilibrium between RCF and ROF for
these molecules happens at room temperature; (ii) the transiently
formed zwitterionic ROFs contain anionic phenolate or ethanolate groups,
which have undoubted similarity with the transiently formed alkali
amines employed in those enzymetic reactions by nature; (iii) the
process of CO2 capture and release can be conveniently
visualized and monitored via color changes.

Herein, we have
selected three types of related molecular switches
as test molecular platforms and investigated the possible relationships
between their structures and CO2-capture responses to screen
for suitable transient bases that can serve as protein mimics. The
visually reversible process of CO2 capture by transient
bases in the form of oxazolidines was studied in detail. The mechanisms
for CO2 capture, which involve dynamic reversible bonding
as well as multimolecular cooperative interactions that occur with
the help of a polyhydroxyl environment, are investigated and confirmed.
Potential applications for the transient bases in visual CO2 detection under different detection limits were developed by fine
tuning of the structures. Our study also offers a new feasible explanation
for further understanding the process of dynamic CO2 capture
in biosystems. Findings from this biomimetic exploration might hint
at a simple way forward in developing biomimicking technologies and
understanding complicated life processes, which will help stimulate
innovations for vital industrial applications.

Results and Discussion
Designing
and Screening Suitable Transient Bases
To
test our assumptions about CO2 capture, we have selected
and prepared three classes of seven structurally related molecules:
oxazolidines (1–3), oxazines (4, 5), and spiropyrans (6, 7) (see Figure 1a). Ethanol (EtOH) was chosen as a solvent instead of water to mimic
the polyhydric microenvironment within an enzyme, as well as to avoid
confusion from possible acidochromism20 induced by carbonate or hydrochromism21 induced by water. The CO2-capture properties of these
color switches were preliminarily evaluated by color changes with
quick solution tests in anhydrous EtOH (see Figure 1b). Oxazines (4 and 5) are not optimal candidates due to the fact that they are either
oversensitive (or nearly inactive) to stimulation by ethanol, and
consequently, a considerable amount of their ROFs already exist (or
hardly exist) in the solution. These properties render their responses
to CO2 difficult to observe. The spiropyrans (6 and 7) were eliminated next for the reason that their
ROFs can hardly be trapped by the introduction of CO2,
even in aqueous solutions. Oxazolidines (1–3), by contrast, were selected as potential candidates because
of their much better performances in response to CO2, which
were accompanied by obvious color changes; when CO2 was
purged from the solution by brief bubbling with the nitrogen or argon
gas, the solutions of 1–3 in EtOH
all returned to their initial states. These phenomena happen because
the nucleophilicity of the zwitterionic ethanolates found in the ROFs
of the oxazolidines is much stronger than that of the phenolates in
the ROFs for the spiropyrans or oxazines. This inference is further
supported by the order of their calculated alkalinities determined
via B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) by Gaussian 1622 and
the computational scheme suggested in the literature.23 These calculated alkalinities reflect their nucleophilicities
to some extent, that is, oxazolidines (1–3) > oxazines (4, 5) > spiropyrans
(6, 7) (Figure S1 and Table S1). These observations indicate that the CO2-capture process is greatly influenced by the nucleophilicity of
the transient base.

ring-closed forms
(RCFs) and ring-open forms (ROFs). (b) Results of quick solution tests
(photographs of solutions of 1–7 in
ethanol after introduction or removal of CO2 under ambient
conditions). The suitable compounds are boxed in red.

Considering that inter/intramolecular dipole–dipole
interactions
are usually affected by their substituent groups, we anticipated that
the CO2-capture rates and the associated color changes
for the oxazolidines may be affected by different functional groups.
According to our previous work,21 oxazolidines
with electron-donating groups on the indole benzene ring prefer to
exist in their ROFs even without CO2, whereas strong electron-donating
groups on the styrene benzene ring increase color intensities. Thus,
the three oxazolidines (1–3) in Figure 1a were designed with
either electron-withdrawing or no substituents on their indole rings
and N,N-dimethylamine on their styrene
rings. Their X-ray crystal structures are shown in Figure 2a (for detailed information,
see Table S2 and Figure S2). Experimental
results reveal that 3, which has no substituent on its
indole ring, shows a fast response rate (nearly instantaneous color
change observed by eye upon addition of CO2), yet it appears
light pink before the introduction of CO2. With electron-withdrawing
groups (i.e., nitro or methylsulfoxide) on their indole rings, 2 and 1 exist as colorless RCFs in EtOH and turn
to blue and purple after introduction of CO2, respectively.
However, both sensitivity and response times with respect to CO2 capture for 1 and 2 are less than
those for 3. The calculated alkalinity (or nucleophilicity)
order for their ROFs is 3O > 1O > 2O (see Table S1). Notably, electron-withdrawing groups (i.e., nitro
or methylsulfoxide) in conjugation with the indole ring can decrease
the alkalinity of oxazolidine ROFs, even though they are not conjugated
with their close-by ethanolates. This can be understood from Lewis
acid/base theory, that is, acidity/basicity of an ionizable molecule
is highly dependent on the relative acidic/basic intensities of the
cation and anion of its ion pair. To further explain the substituent
effect on their CO2-capture sensitivities, the free energies
and activation barriers for their ring-opening and CO2-capturing
reactions were calculated (Figure 2b). The results show that the ring-opening steps for
forming the transient bases of 1–3 are spontaneous with negative changes in free energy (ΔGI), whereas CO2 capture by the transient
base is the rate-controlling step with much higher free energy barriers
(ΔGII) (see Figures 2b and S3–S6). The kinetics for CO2 captured by 1–3 were tested, which fit well with a first-order reaction
mechanism at the early stage. The rate constants for 1, 2, and 3 were measured as 1.49 ×
10–4, 9.52 × 10–5, and 2.16
× 10–3 s–1, respectively
(Figures S7, S8 and Table S3). Taken together,
both order of the free energy barriers for CO2 capture
(ΔGII: 3 < 1 < 2) and rate constants (k: 3 > 2 > 1) are highly
related
to the order of the transient bases’ nucleophilicities (3O > 1O > 2O), and the relationship is shown in Figure 2c. These results further indicate
that nucleophilicity is an important factor in determining the ability
of a transient base to capture CO2.

Dynamic CO2 Capture with the Transient Bases Formed
from the Oxazolidines
We take 1 as an example
to discuss in detail dynamic CO2 capture by a transient
base, which possesses a colorless ring-closed isomer 1C and colored ring-open isomer 1O′, a product formed by the addition of CO2 to the
ring-open isomer 1O in anhydrous EtOH. The
solution of 1 in anhydrous EtOH is initially colorless
and has no detectable absorption in the visible region of the spectrum,
an observation that indicates that 1C isomer
is dominant before the addition of CO2. When CO2 was bubbled briefly into a solution of 1C, a purple color change was observed, an observation that indicates
the formation of 1O′. This conclusion
was supported by UV–vis spectroscopy, that is, a new absorption
band appeared in the visible region around 568 nm, accompanied with
a decrease in the absorption band at 298 nm (Figure 3a). When this purple solution was purged
briefly with “inert” gases (air, nitrogen, or argon)
lacking high concentrations of CO2, it returned to its
initial colorless state, with the absorption bands returning to their
original intensities. This process can be repeated many times without
any detectable decomposition indicated by a stable isosbestic point
at 400 nm (Figure 3b).

peaks labeled with (×) are attributed to methanol (MeOH) and
water.

Dynamic CO2 capture
by reversible transient base 1 was further confirmed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy
(Figure 3c). 1 was observed to be nearly completely in its RCF in deuterium-substituted
methanol (MeOD), even although the solution was slightly pink before
the introduction of CO2 (Figure 3c,i). Upon introduction of CO2, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a new set of resonances,
mostly shifted downfield, which arise from the protons of the colored,
CO2-triggered structure 1O′
(Figure 3c,ii). The
appearance of a new pair of resonances was observed at δ = 4.58
ppm for Hy and δ = 4.03 ppm for Hx instead
of multiple peaks at δ = 3.79–3.51 ppm, as well as a
single peak at δ = 1.88 ppm instead of two resonances at δ
= 1.46 and 1.18 ppm for HMe, signals that are characteristic
of ethane protons (i.e., −CH2–CH2–O–), and those of the two methyls on the
indole of 1O′, respectively (Figure 3c,ii). The maximum
ratio of 1O′ to 1C is 1:3, a value that is calculated by integrating the area
of the characteristic peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. When
this purple solution was purged briefly with nitrogen, the 1H NMR signals shifted back to their initial positions (Figure 3c,iii). Analyzed in a similar
manner as 1, the maximum ratios of 2O′ to 2C and 3O′ to 3C are 1:3.3 and 14.5:1,
respectively, after bubbling with CO2 (Figures S9 and S10). This result is consistent with the afore-discovered
sensitivity order of each oxazolidine’s CO2-capturing
ability, that is, 3 > 1 > 2. All of these observations indicate clearly that CO2 can
be reversibly captured and released by the transient bases formed
from these oxazolidines.

Detailed Mechanism of CO2 Capture
with Oxazolidines
An in-depth understanding of the CO2-capture mechanism
is essential to design new materials for selective detection or removal
of CO2, as well as to assist in better understanding some
of the complicated biological processes. There are three species in
this reaction that need to be considered: CO2, oxazolidines,
and the solvent. First, the media effects of different solvents on
the capture of CO2 by oxazolidines are investigated. The
effect of the surrounding medium provided by the solvent is analogous
to the effects caused by the microenvironments found within enzymes
or proteins. Various solvents were chosen to replace EtOH while the
other conditions remained the same. Similar color changes also occurred
in solutions of 1 in the protic solvents MeOH and propanol
(PrOH) after the introduction of CO2, but not in aprotic
solvents, such as ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and acetonitrile (MeCN) (see Figure 4a). In addition, the ratio of 1O′ formed increases proportionally according to
the hydrogen-bond-donating capability of the protic solvents (see Figure 4b). This result is
due to the fact that hydrogen bonding between the proton of the solvent
and 1O′ will greatly decrease free
energy of 1O′, a hypothesis which is
further supported by theoretical calculations (see Figures 4c, S11 and S12). It is to be noted that 1C and 1O coexist in most solvents (except
in EtOAc) at room temperature via dynamic equilibrium even before
the introduction of CO2 (see amplified graph in Figure 4a). These observations
indicate that the formation of the transient base of 1O is greatly influenced by the nature of the polyhydric
environment, a situation that is similar to water-manipulated microenvironments
around enzymes, and these environments play important roles in CO2 capture by oxazolidines.

solvents in comparison to the gas-phase reaction. Inset is the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)-optimized
structure of the transition state for the reaction of 1O capturing CO2 stabilized by two solvent molecules
of MeOH.

In situ 13C NMR experiments
with the aid of two-dimensional
correlation analyses were carried out in MeOD to further confirm the
structural changes of the oxazolidines before and after the introduction
of CO2 (see Figures S13–S16). Taking into consideration that the 13C signal strength
of oxazolidines in their ROFs is related to their solubilities (1C: less than 2 mg/0.5 mL in MeOD; 3C: less than 5 mg/0.5 mL in MeOD) and the maximum ratios
of ROF to RCF for each compound (1O′/1C = 1:3; 3O′/3C = 14.5:1), we chose 3 instead of 1 for 13C NMR investigation. When CO2 was purged into a saturated solution of 3, the solubility
of 3 in MeOD was greatly increased (see Figure S17), an observation that is consistent with the reaction
of CO2 with 3 to produce 3O′, whose solubility is larger than that of 3C. Compared to the 13C NMR spectra of 3C (see Figure 5a) and 3O(H) (formed by the
addition of deuterium CF3COOH to a solution of 3C, Figure 5b), 3 in MeOD after the introduction of CO2 includes both 3C and 3O′, and 3O′ has nearly
the same 13C signals as those of 3O (see Figure 5d).
It is important to note that there are two additional peaks at δ
= 161.5 and 126.3 ppm in comparison to the spectrum resulting from
acid-triggered ring-opening by the addition of deuterium chloride,
forming 3O(H) or 3O(H)+ (Figure S18). The peak at
δ = 126.3 ppm arising from dissolved CO2 in MeOD
is also observed after bubbling CO2 into pure MeOD (see Figure 5c). The peak at δ
= 161.5 ppm is the C signal from the newly formed carbonate24,25 ester. However, this one-dimensional NMR experiment still cannot
directly verify that the carbonate is a result of covalent bonding
between the ethoxide of 3O and CO2. In situ 13C–DOSY NMR was carried out to provide
additional evidence of the carbonate formed. By measuring any differences
that arise in the diffusion coefficients that can be measured for
each carbon signal, 13C–DOSY NMR26,27 is used to determine whether two or more molecules are covalently
bonded together. Typically, molecules with different molecular weights
are characterized by different diffusion coefficients. As shown in Figure 5e, the result clearly
confirms that the carbonate is the product of transient base of 3O reacting with CO2, as the signal
of this new carbonate has the same diffusion order as the signals
for 3O′. The carbonate structure is
further verified by the fact that a new peak at m/z = 379.2382 appears in the high-resolution mass
spectrum for this colored solution (see Figure S19). Based on all of these data, we can conclude that the
mechanism for capturing CO2, which is accompanied by a
color change, is based on dynamic covalent bonds, i.e., reversible
reactions between CO2 and the transient bases that result
from the ROFs of the oxazolidines. The generated carbonate is stabilized
by the dynamic poly H-bonds provided by protic solvents and disturbed
by reducing the CO2 content simply via the introduction
of inert gases.

Cooperative Interplay of Transient Bases for Dynamic Capturing
of CO2
We asked whether this dynamic CO2 capture could occur through cooperative interactions between multiple
transient bases and CO2. These types of cooperative interactions
would be similar to the dynamic reaction centers of biological systems,
such as enzymes and receptors. To test this possibility, we did further
quantitative 13C NMR experiments on solutions of 3 in MeOD after the introduction of CO2. As shown
in Figure 6a, we surprisingly
found that oxazolidines capture CO2 at a constant ratio
of two transient bases formed from the ROFs interacting with one molecule
of CO2, regardless of whether the ratio of 3O′ to 3C is 14.5:1 (Figure 6a,i) or 9:1 (Figure 6a,ii). This observation
indicates that the CO2-capture process by the transient
bases of the oxazolidines is via dynamic multimolecular cooperative
interactions (see Figure 6b). This dynamic multimolecular cooperative mechanism serves
to improve the efficiency of CO2 capture and transport,
a hypothesis that is supported by the fact that the relative proportion
of dissolved molecules of CO2 in the solution also increased
(from 4:1 to 7:1, ratio of dissolved CO2 to carbonated
CO2) with the increase in 3O′.
Subsequently, the CO2 involved in further downstream reactions
in the same system will also be expected to be greatly improved.

mg) in MeOD (0.5 mL) after inletting CO2 at different rates

of the cooperative interactions involved in the dynamic CO2 capture by oxazolidines.

Concentration Dependence of Dynamic CO2 Capture
From the perspective of reactions involving CO2 in nature,
dynamic CO2-capture/release processes by the transient
bases formed from functional groups within protein-aggregates are
dependent on the amount of CO2, which can only passively
diffuse in or out of the respiratory system of a given organism, i.e.,
CO2 is never “bubbled in”. These properties
are also prerequisite for developing practical applications involving
transient bases. With these considerations in mind, we first investigated
the relationship between the amount of ROFs formed and the CO2 level. The UV–vis absorption spectra show that the
colored 1O′ forms even when a gaseous
mixture containing only 1% CO2 was bubbled into the solution
(see Figure 7a). The
absorption intensity of 1O′ at 568
nm gradually increases with CO2 content, accompanied by
a gradually deepening of the color (see Figure 7b). It should be noted that purging each
solution continuously with a large excess volume of the gaseous mixture
did not lead to more 1O′. Nevertheless,
the rate at which CO2 was bubbled in, which affects the
rate at which intermolecular collisions occur, influences the proportion
of 1O′ formed. As is illustrated in Figure 7c, it was found that
the solutions of 1 in EtOH also changed color simply
by blanketing the top of the liquid with a layer of CO2 above the solution instead of bubbling directly into it. Diffusion
of the colored solution formed at the top to the bottom can be visually
monitored. In addition, recovery of the purple solutions of 1O′ to their initial colorless states can
be achieved by simply leaving the solution in open air. These results
clearly suggest that CO2 capture/release by the transient
bases of the oxazolidines can occur through passive diffusion of CO2 under ambient conditions, similar to some biological processes.
Based on the distinct color-changing characteristics that occur upon
capturing CO2, oxazolidines have great potential in various
applications where visual CO2 detection is needed using
only the naked eye without additional assay kits. We confirmed that
the CO2 detection limits of 1, 2, and 3 are 2, 20, and 0.5%, respectively (see Figure 7d), and this system
of oxazolidine/alcohol can resist interference from ordinary neutral
air pollutants, especially carbon monoxide and methane (see Figure S20). Oxazolidines with different substituents
may result in CO2-response limits and concomitant color
changes that can be fined-tuned such that they can meet the needs
of a diverse number of applications to be used for different occasions
(see Supplementary Discussion 1 in the
Supporting Information).

Reflections on CO2 Capture within Dynamic Protein-Aggregates
One significant goal in scientific research is to better understand
and mimic the complex reactions or biological processes found in nature,
an endeavor that directs us to develop new and ecofriendly technologies
for human needs. Results from this biomimetic research as well as
our previous related reports reveal the following inferences. (1)
The long-conjectured mechanism, in which the alkaline amino residues
important to some enzymes or protein-aggregates (e.g., RuBisCO or
Hb) might be formed via thermodynamically controlled interatomic weak
bond changes brought about by alteration of tertiary or quaternary
conformations at the beginning of various biological reactions, is
possible and reasonable. (2) Formation of transient bases is a prerequisite
for CO2 capture by molecules. (3) The anticipated mechanism
of reversible CO2 capture and release by the transient
bases of oxazolidines is workable. These inferences also suggest that
the previously conjectured mechanism on dynamic formation of carbamates
from alkaline-free amines and CO2 is indeed feasible. (4)
Dynamic alteration of molecular structure and conformation to generate
transient bases for CO2 capture is highly dependent on
their polyhydric microenvironments. More hydrophilic surroundings
favor transient base formation. This also explains, at least to some
degree, why life cannot exist without water and why the capability
of photosynthesis is significantly reduced during times of drought.
(5) Formation and decomposition of the carbamates or carbonates formed
from the transient bases and CO2 are processes that occur
at thermodynamic equilibrium, and are highly dependent on CO2 concentration. This result is consistent with previous findings
that the limiting factor on photosynthesis in Britain during the summer
is CO2 concentration. (6) Cooperative and competitive interactions
between multiple transient bases seems to be a feasible and convincing
route for continuous CO2 capture and transformation in
biosystems. Within the reaction centers of proteins-aggregates, multiple
amines from lysine residue side chains jostle one molecule of CO2 between each other, like juggling, forming temporary coordinate
bonds therein. (7) Molecules with different rates of reversible conformational
changes (such as spiropyrans versus oxazolidines, or oxazolidine 1 versus 2 or 3) have different
sensitivities with respect to their responses to CO2 as
a result of their specific stereochemical structures and nearby dipole
effects. A similar phenomenon in the context of enzymes might provide
another convincing explanation for why different enzymes have different
rates of CO2 capture (e.g., carbonic anhydrase versus RuBisCO)
rather than the generally accepted reason of oxygen competition. (8)
Oxazolidines, which are both photochromic and hydrochromic, excel
when it comes to CO2 capture, especially in comparison
to the spiropyrans, which are only photoresponsive. Such a behavior
might provide a clue as to why chloroplasts and leaves show a greater
proportion of active RuBisCO in response to increased moisture and
light intensity—light and water are vital for activating RuBisCO,
even though CO2 fixation is a well-known dark reaction.

It is worth noting that even though there seems to be little structural
similarity between oxazolidine derivatives and the bio-macromolecules
RuBisCO or Hb, these two sets of molecules do have comparable behaviors
and functions. The fundamental reason for these similar behaviors
are likely the same, i.e., dynamic changes in molecular conformations
(local stereostructure) and/or configuration is realized via thermo-driven
coherent inter/intramolecular dipole–dipole interactions among
multiple adjacent functional groups, whose interactions may also be
under the influence of external field(s) and/or dynamically variable
media.

Based on our results and numerous studies from other
groups, we
now speculate on the specific working principles of enzymes (i.e.,
RuBisCO), which capture CO2 in biological systems, in some
detail. Because the three-dimensional conformations of these enzymes
are maintained mostly by various weak interactions (e.g., hydrogen
bonding, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions) between
functional groups of adjacent polypeptide chains, their stereostructures
around the active site can be easily adjusted by various sources of
thermal energy, such as decomposition of adenosine triphosphate, hydration,
enzymatic action (RuBisCO activase), rapid movement of electrons,
etc., some of the processes that are crucial for cell survival. This
thermal energy will surely stimulate the various stretching/contorting/rotating
and change dipoles of atomic bonds nearby. When multiples of such
atomic motions are striking the same subunit of the protein-aggregates,
their synergetic forces will overcome the activation barrier for altering
the conformation/configuration of the protein subunit, a process that
generates the energetic transient base (e.g., an amino acid residue
possessing an amine) and acid (e.g., amino acid residues with carboxyls
or hydroxyls) by breaking their dipolar covalent bonds. The protein
or enzyme then is activated, whereas also enlisting the help of the
surrounding multihydroxyl environment in addition to metal cations
(e.g., Mg2+, Fe2+).

The current experimental
results further confirm that reversible
covalent chemistry ongoing at thermodynamic equilibrium seems to be
essential for the behavior of enzymes, or molecular-aggregates of
proteins/nucleic acids. Having this understanding makes possible the
further development of synthetic small molecules that mimic biological
functions.

Conclusions
In summary, the design
and synthesis of a kind of transient base
utilizing a series of small molecular switches was achieved. These
switches served as a molecular platform for mimicking some of the
behavior of protein-aggregates and for further understanding the dynamic
covalent CO2 capture in biochemical systems. The relationship
between molecular structures, the ability at equilibrium to form transient
bases, their associated nucleophilicities, and CO2-capture
characteristics have been investigated systematically. The mechanisms
of dynamic CO2 capture involve multimolecular cooperation
and dynamic covalent interactions among the transient bases of the
oxazolidines, which are aided by the polyhydroxyl microenvironment.
Similar to some biosystems, CO2 capture by the transient
bases of oxazolidines is a dynamic CO2-concentration-dependent
process, regardless of whether CO2 is directly bubbled
into the solution or blanketed on top. Due to different sensitivities
and changes in color with respect to CO2 capture, these
small molecules could be applied for the visual detection of CO2 at different detection limits. Furthermore, these small molecules
provide insights into the mechanisms of CO2 capture within
dynamic protein-aggregates, specifically as to how transient bases
are formed within the protein-aggregates that are used for dynamic
CO2 capture. The results herein suggest that the formation
of transient bases is a spontaneous and thermodynamic process once
the CO2 concentration becomes large enough.

Notably,
even though oxazolidine derivatives seem to have little
structural similarity with the bio-macromolecules of RuBisCO or Hb,
they do share comparable behaviors and functions. Considering that
the essential physics and working principle for synthetic and biomolecules
should be universal, we confidently infer that if a given chemical
mechanism is possible for a small molecule, then the same working
principle should also be able to exist in biosystems.

As far
as we know, there are only a few successful examples of
functional bionics in the form of small molecules. Typically, biomimicry
demonstrations involve intricate macromolecules or supramolecular
self-assembled systems.28,29 Thus, this work represents
a new example of bionics that use small molecules to help better understand
the complex dynamic CO2-capture and related processes in
biosystems. In addition, it also provides a new way for designing
functional small molecules for the capture or detection of CO2. An indubitable advantage of this small-molecule platform
is the ease by which the dynamic processes can be understood visibly.
Other techniques like single-crystal analysis of the more stable structural
state and/or extremely difficult computer simulations require much
more time and expertize. This means of visual detection will undoubtedly
simplify and speed up the investigations and discoveries on biochemistry,
molecular biology, cell biology, synthetic biology, epigenetics, biomimetic
engineering and material science, etc. We welcome further verifications
and investigations from global researchers on the aforesaid insights
into the transient base formation within the CO2-capture
enzymes.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All of the
solvents used were
purified by literature methods. Chemicals and reagents of the highest
grade commercial availability were used without further purification.
CO2 and N2 gases used in this study were purged
directly into the solutions inside either the NMR tube or the UV–vis
cuvette before recording the spectra unless otherwise noted. Compounds 1–7 were synthesized according to our
previous work.21

Characterizations
1H NMR (500, 600 MHz)
and 13C NMR (126, 150 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE500 (or AVANCE 600) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the reference
standard at room temperature. In 1H NMR spectra, chemical
shifts (parts per million) were referenced to residual solvent protons
(3.31 ppm in MeOD). In 13C NMR spectra, chemical shifts
(parts per million) were referenced to the carbon signal of the deuterated
solvent (49.0 ppm in MeOD). High resolution electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an Agilent 1290-micrOTOF-Q
II mass spectrometer. The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured
from 230 to 800 nm at a scan rate of 5 nm/s using a Shimadzu UV-2550
PC double-beam spectrophotometer with a path length of 1 cm. The solutions
for UV–vis measurements were prepared with a concentration
of 1 × 10–4 M, unless otherwise specified.
The kinetics was measured on an Analitik Jena Specord 210 plus UV–vis
spectrophotometer.

Theoretical Calculations
The density
functional theory
(DFT) calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 1622 program at the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) level. The UV–vis
spectra of the transient bases of the oxazolidines were calculated
at the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) level. The
energy barriers were calculated in the gas phase, as well as by using
a hybrid model (implicit model-polarizable continuum model and explicit
cluster model with MeOH solvent molecules). As for the NMR calculations,
geometry optimization was performed with the B3LYP method and 6-311+G(2d,p)
basis set. The gauge-independent atomic orbital approximation30 in the Gaussian 16 package was also employed
to calculate the NMR shifts. In the NMR shift calculations, TMS was
used as the reference. Computed structures were illustrated using
CYLVIEW drawings.31
