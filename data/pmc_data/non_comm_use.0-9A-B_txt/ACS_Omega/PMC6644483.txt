Inspired by the role
of coadsorbents in dye-sensitized solar cells,
a pathway to disfavor aggregation in disclike luminophores was studied
to enhance solid-state emission. By restricting the intense π–π
stacking using a multicyclic aliphatic ring system, we brought the
lithocholic ring system as bulky side substitution into the fluorophore
design. Compared to the small-size cyclohexyl substitution in BC-CY6, which exhibited a bathochromic shift in solid-state
emission owing to the intermolecular interactions, lithocholic-substituted BC-LTH had reduced intense intermolecular interactions. This
very bulky/voluminous side substitution (lithocholic unit) helped
us extract intermolecular interaction-free molecular emission in solid
state. The cyclohexyl substitution provided solid-state emission,
and the broad and high Stokes shift provided an insight into stacking
interactions. Face-to-face stacking-originated dimerlike species was
observed in the crystal packing, which was studied by theoretical
geometry optimization. The dimer species exhibited an intermolecular
distance of 3.5 Å. The molecular sizes of the developed chromophores
were estimated by geometry optimization, and it was concluded that
the dimeric interactions in BC-LTH may not be formed
owing to the voluminous nature of the side substitution present. Hence,
we have been able to successfully establish through molecular level
understanding the role of lithocholic functionality in tuning the
optoelectronic properties of various emissive materials for different
applications.

1 Introduction
The
concern about the depleting fossil fuels has intensified in
the scientific community, and this issue has guided research toward
renewable energy sources. This approach is one of the many possible
ways to solve the increasing global energy demand. But at the same
time, it is necessary to develop efficient devices/techniques, which
can work upon minimum energy with maximum output. In this context,
the development of organic electronics has emerged as a useful tool,
which offers excellent energy efficiency. Organic photovoltaics (conversion
of solar energy to electric energy) is considered to be an excellent
clean energy source, and the technologies that can use this energy
efficiently are highly desired. In this regard, the development of
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) represents both energy-efficient
and cost-effective technology. The “organic semiconducting
material” (OSC) is the key behind the development of these
technologies. The organic fluorophores are capable of generating light
efficiently with the expense of very little electrical energy.1,2 The journey of fluorophore development has great influence in making
OLED devices, the efficient light-producing devices. The conventional
fluorophores usually have disclike shapes, and when the fluorophore
molecules are in close proximity, as in solid state, they undergo
strong face-to-face pi–pi stacking interactions.3 In this aggregate state, owing to the strong
intermolecular interactions, the nonradiative relaxation pathways
for photoexcited molecules become active, and hence fluorophores loose
the emission property. This phenomenon has been discussed widely with
many examples and is known as aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).3 As a result, the flat fluorophores are not efficient
solid-state emitters, which limit the application of many efficient
fluorpohores such as pyrene, perylene, and anthracene directly into
thin-film applications. As a solution to ACQ designs, the twisted/nonplanar
geometries are generally adopted, which prevent formation of the close
face-to-face pi–pi stacking interactions when they are in close
proximity. The twisted fluorophore design provides efficient light-emitting
materials such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and thermally
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials.4−7 TADF materials are current state-of-art
materials as they have surpassed the theoretical upper limit of the
fluorescence quantum efficiency.8,9 Because of the design
limitations, flat luminophores have been left out of the thin-film
application field. The diversion of research toward the TADF and AIE
materials has hampered the process of material and application development
aspects related to flat luminophores. There has been many design strategies
introduced to prevent the face-to-face pi–pi stacking interactions,
so that the solid-state emission could be generated in the flat luminophores.3,7,10−14 As far as the modern fluorophore design is concerned,
the strategies capable of understanding the photophysical processes
and developing real world applications from the conventional fluorophore
are equally important as the twisted molecular design is not reliable
for every application. The introduction of alkyl long chains and three-dimensional
(3D) rigid cyclic systems into the flat molecular design has been
utilized to prevent pi–pi stacking and to generate solid-state
emission.13,15 The alkyl substitution provides solubility
to the molecular structure, and thus the spin-coating technique becomes
feasible. Moreover, such a modification does not alter the optical
properties of the central emitting core because of the noninvolvement
nature of the sp3-hybridized aliphatic system into the
conjugated emitting core. In this context, dye-sensitized solar cell
(DSSC) technology also utilizes the flat molecular design but uses
a very simple technique, which prevents deterring close interactions
in the molecules by diluting the organic material with the aliphatic
units known as coadsorbent molecules.16−21 A similar strategy has never been employed to promote solid-state
emission in flat fluorophores as it may affect dye loading every time
and hence the device efficiency. The covalently linked coadsorbent
dye molecules and their effect on pi–pi stacking interactions
to help originate solid-state emission in flat luminophores has never
been studied. Our continuous efforts to understand the molecular packing
and emission efficiency resulted in the synthesis of BC-CY6 and BC-LTH, where molecular design was introduced with
monocyclic (cyclohexyl) and multicyclic (acetyl derivative of lithocholic
acid) derivatives of flat nonemissive .coumarin luminophores (see Scheme 1). The tailored materials gained AIE and were utilized as active materials in green emissive
OLED devices.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Protocol Used to Obtain Compounds BC-CY6 and BC-LTH
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Photophysical
Studies
The synthesis
of the parent coumarin derivative was completed using a previous reported
procedure, and then the required aliphatic substations were introduced
at the hydroxyl functionality of coumarin (see Scheme 1). The synthesized compounds were obtained
in moderate yields after column chromatography purification and were
then characterized using 1H and 13C nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectroscopy
(HRMS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The steady-state
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) and fluorescence studies
were completed on the dilute solutions [5 × 10–6 M in tetrahydrofuran (THF)] of the compounds. All compounds showed
vibronic absorption features with a short wavelength absorption maximum
around 286 nm and a long wavelength absorption around 405 nm (see Figure 1). The presence of
a small cyclohexyl ring or bulky lithocholic derivative ring system
did not enforce any visible effect on the absorbing behavior of the
compounds. Similarly, the excitation wavelength nondependent photoluminescence
(PL) emission maxima lie around 460 nm (λex = 341
nm) irrespective of the size of the substituent. The quantum yields
and lifetime data in the DCM solution of BC-LTH and BC-CY6 have been tabulated in Table S1 (see Supporting Information). Both compounds showed similar light
emission efficiency and lifetime values. The lifetime decay (see Figure S1) showed biexponential decays for both
compounds. These results validated that all compounds have identical
absorbing and emitting units contained in them (see Figure 1). The PL emission in solid
state showed variability as the PL maximum lied around 470 and 493
nm (see Figure 1),
with the emission of BC-CY6 more bathochromically shifted
than that of BC-LTH. BC-CY6 exhibited a
broad emission at 493 nm (ΦPL,solid = 14%) accompanying
a bathochromic shift of 33 nm from its solution emission maximum.
On the other hand, lithocholic-substituted BC-LTH showed
emission maxima at 477 nm with a red shift of only 17 nm compared
to its solution emission (ΦPL,solid = 23%). Comparing
the size of substitution in these compounds, it is easy to understand
that the broad and bathochromic emission in the former compound is
due to the presence of strong intermolecular interactions, whereas
in the latter compound, the bulky substitution may have prevented
the close face-to-face pi–pi stacking of molecules. The observed
broadness in the tail region of the PL spectra of BC-LTH might be due to the presence of different degrees of short-range
interactions existing between neighboring molecules.

Figure 1 UV–vis absorption
and PL profiles for BC-CY6 and BC-LTH in
solution and solid state.

The behavior of steady-state UV–vis absorption and
PL emission
was also studied as a function of solvent polarity (see Figure S1a–d). As shown in Figure S1, neither the absorption nor the PL
emission profile was shifted significantly with the change in the
solvent system from dichloromethane (DCM) to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).
The UV–vis spectra were unaffected completely, whereas a small
red shift of 17 nm was observed in PL spectra of both compounds in
DMSO. The UV–vis absorption and PL spectra of parent coumarin
has been provided in the Supporting Information for comparison (Figure S1e,f). This small
red shift validated the existence of weak intramolecular charge-transfer
property of the compounds upon photoexcitation. Also, the bathochromic
shift only in the PL profile of both the compounds suggested that,
first the absorption occurs on the vibrational level in the excited
state, which then stabilized to the low-energy state owing to the
charge-transfer character, and then finally decayed radiatively to
the ground state.22

The planar aromatic
molecules are efficient fluorescent emitters
in their respective solutions but the aggregation of the flat emitters
debilitates the emission property in the solid state. The monocyclic
(BC-CY6) and multicyclic (BC-LTH) aliphatic
ring substitutions resulted in an increment in solid-state quantum
yields. It must be noted that the coumarin core without any side substitution
is weakly fluorescent in the solid state owing to the flat design
and pi–pi stacking interactions.13 Also, BC-CY6 showed broadness and a bathochromic shift
in the PL spectra compared to BC-LTH. Thus, it urges
us to study the aggregation process, which governs the origin of emission
from the closely packed state. In the tetrahydrofuran (THF)–water
experiment, BC-CY6 showed an increment of fluorescence
intensity up to 60% addition of water into THF, and then suffered
a huge decrease in the PL intensity on further addition of water.
Similarly, the fluorescence increment occurred with 20% addition of
water for BC-LTH, which then increased up to 60% of water
addition. Further addition of water reduced the fluorescence intensity
of the solution (see Figure 2). Thus, the origin of solid-state emission in both compounds
could be attributed to the aggregation of the molecules in the solid
state.23,24

Figure 2 PL behavior of (a) BC-CY6 and (b) BC-LTH in THF–water mixtures.

The THF–water experiment was further assembled with
the
measurement of the particle size upon aggregation using the dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurement.25 First,
the particle sizes of neat THF solutions of both BC-CY6 and BC-LTH were measured to be around 20 nm [polydispersity
index (PDI) = 0.127] and 9.2 nm (PDI = 0.168), respectively (see Figure S2). Then, the sizes were measured for
the solutions containing 90% water as the highest aggregation was
observed for these solutions. Interestingly, the particle size for BC-LTH was found to be around 178 nm (PDI = 0.172), whereas BC-CY6 showed a huge particle size in the range of 860 nm
or 0.8 μm (PDI = 0.362). These studies also suggested the high
aggregation tendency of the planar chromophore with smaller cyclohexyl
peripheral substitution as compared to the smaller aggregates with
the lithocholic unit.

2.2 Molecular Packing
To understand the
molecular organization in the solid state, crystallization of the
compounds was attempted. Needlelike crystals of BC-CY6 were obtained from the THF/DCM (1:1) solution, whereas BC-LTH failed to give crystals in various solvent systems. BC-CY6 crystallized in the triclinic space group P1̅ with DCM molecules
trapped in the crystal structure (see Figure S3). The crystal refinement data are given in Table S1. The phenyl ring exhibited a torsional angle of 47°
with the naphthalene ring plane (see Figure S4a). The molecules attained a sandwich staircase-type packing of the
stacked molecules (see Figure 3b). The sandwiched layers exhibited an interplanar distance
of 3.5 Å between the stacked molecules, and the molecules were
slipped by an angle of 16° from the other (see Figure 3b). The next sandwiched layer
was slipped by an angle of 51.8° from the first layer. Each layer
had an antiparallel arrangement of the dye molecules to reduce the
intermolecular interactions/steric repulsions between similar groups,
which also led to the close packing of the molecules with 30% π-overlap
of the naphthalene rings in closely packed adjacent molecules (see Figure S5). Also, these molecules exhibited short-range
communications with the carbonyl C=O in the coumarin ring of
one molecule and a similar carbonyl group of the other low-lying molecule.
The molecules in the one-dimensional (1D) layer showed communication
through the carbonyl C=O···H–C (naphthalene,
H9) contacts. The closely packed molecules with an interplanar
distance of 3.5 Å could be expected to undergo the dimer interactions,
which explained the red-shifted emission to 495 nm in the solid state
of BC-CY6 (see Figure S6).
We believe that the presence of bulky lithocholic substitution into
the BC-LTH molecular design would not allow the close
intermolecular/dimer interactions upon aggregation to shift the emission
to longer wavelengths.26,27 This is also proved by the solid-state
emission of BC-LTH, which showed a minimum shift from
the emission observed in the solution-state that signified the absence
of strong intermolecular interactions upon aggregation in BC-LTH.28

diagram and (b) crystal
packing of BC-CY6 showing the interplanar distance d and slip angles.

2.3 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Thermal Studies
Electrochemical analysis of both compounds in DCM was found to
exhibit irreversible reduction peaks within the scanned potential
window. The reduction voltage was used to calculate the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO), and the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) energy levels were obtained by adding the bandgap values to
the LUMO level. The reduction onset values of −0.62 and −0.51
V provided the LUMO energy levels at −3.68 and −3.73
eV for BC-CY6 and BC-LTH, respectively (see Figure 4).29,30 From the UV–vis absorption onset of 432 nm, the optical bandgap
values were calculated to be 2.88 eV for both compounds, which provided
the HOMO levels at −6.55 and −6.60 eV for BC-CY6 and BC-LTH, respectively.13

Figure 4 (a)
CV curves showing reduction potentials and (b) thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) data, for BC-CY6 and BC-LTH.

Thermal stabilities were gauged
by TGA in the heating scan up to
700 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C per minute (see Figure 4b). BC-CY6 showed better thermal stability up to 290 °C with a decomposition
temperature (5% weight loss temperature) of 335 °C. The weight
loss exhibited by BC-LTH around 100 °C is due to
the loss of solvent and trapped water molecules and thus lost 5% weight
around 150 °C; but still, after that compound continued to lose
mass, it took another 100 °C to lose further 5% (at 265 °C)
of the mass of the compound. The better thermal stability of BC-CY6 is due to the close packing and presence of dimerlike
interactions in the compound, which are absent in BC-LTH.

2.4 Theoretical Studies
Density functional
theory (DFT) studies were carried out to understand the distribution
of the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) in the designed compounds.
Gaussian 09 suit of program was used to carry out the computational
studies.31 In terms of the basis set, B3LYP-6-31g(d,p)
was used to optimize the geometries. Once the structures were optimized,
the TD-DFT approach was utilized to calculate the respective singlet–singlet
transition energies. The FMO analysis revealed that the electron density
of the HOMO lies on the naphthalene ring and the coumarin ring, whereas
that of the LUMO lies toward the coumarin ring with a little extension
into the phenyl substituent (see Figure 5). The similar distribution of the FMOs could
be ascribed to the similar molecular backbone in both compounds. It
is also clear that the aliphatic substitutions (cyclohexyl ring and
lithocholic ring) did not contribute to the HOMO and LUMO, and thus
no effect on the bandgap was observed for both compounds, which also
explained the emission in the similar wavelength region. For the compound BC-CY6, the cyclohexyl ring attained the classical chair conformation
and thus could be expected to have ineffective steric bulkiness around
the molecules to prevent the close π–π stacking
upon aggregation. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) studies
also proved the presence of a small intermolecular distance in the
molecules, and the dimerlike stacking was also observed (see Molecular Packing section). The dimer form was
also optimized, where the intermolecular distance was found to be
3.6 Å (see Figure S6), which was very
close to the experimental value (3.5 Å).

Figure 5 Optimized geometries
of BC-CY6 and BC-LTH and the corresponding
HOMO and LUMO energy levels.

The TD-DFT also provided insights into the excitation process,
and the simulated UV–vis absorption profiles were well-matched
with the experimental data (see Figures S8 and S9). The main electronic transitions and the involved molecular
orbitals have been shown in the Supporting Information. For BC-CY6, the lowest lying electronic transition
was attributed to the HOMO-to-LUMO transition and had a charge-transfer
nature. Because of the similar molecular structures of BC-CY6 and BC-LTH, the electronic transition behavior of the
latter was almost identical to that of the former.

In the absence
of the crystal structure of BC-LTH,
optimized geometries proved helpful and provided the structural aspects
of the lithocholic functionalization of the coumarin core. As the
blue-shifted solid-state PL emission spectrum of BC-LTH, compared to BC-CY6, already provided the insight into
the reduced intermolecular interactions, the optimized geometry also
supported the observed behavior. When the respective sizes of the
side substitution in BC-LTH and BC-CY6 were
compared (see Figure S10), it was observed
that the lithocholic unit (17 Å) was much longer than the cyclohexyl
unit (5.2 Å), whereas the coumarin core had the same size (10.9
Å). Thus, the aggregation is expected to be highly affected in BC-LTH. The bigger size of the lithocholic unit might have
induced longitudinal/transverse displacements of the neighboring molecules
and thus prevented the face-to-face stacking.28 Previous efforts explored the effect of linear aliphatic chains
and 3D aliphatic rings on the coumarin core but did not overcome the
intermolecular interactions to that extent. But the lithocholic functionalization
of planar coumarin resulted in the significant decrease in the face-to-face
π–π interactions and induced a systematic blue
shift in the emission wavelength compared to BC-CY6 in
the solid state.28

2.5 Electroluminescence
(EL)
Having explored
these compounds for solution and solid-state photophysical properties,
the compounds were then utilized as the OLED-emitting layer to study
the EL properties. As the compounds BC-CY6/BC-LTH failed to give EL when utilized as neat emitters in the OLED devices,
the doped device architecture was used as a solution to obtain emission
from the compounds.32,33 CBP was picked as the host matrix
in which the dye molecules BC-CY6/BC-LTH were doped, and the utilized device structure is shown in Figure 6. The effect of varying
the doping percentage of guest molecules in the host matrix was also
studied by varying the dye percentage between 1 and 10% in the host
matrix. The layers were coated using a spin-coater, which provides
the solution-processed devices with these small molecules. The devices
1-i and 2-i with 1% of BC-LTH and BC-CY6 showed anomalous EL with an intense peak around 400 nm and a broad
peak around 500 nm. When compared with the solution/solid-state PL
spectra, it was concluded that the emission did not have its origin
from the active emitting layers (BC-CY6/BC-LTH). The blue emission around 400 nm must be coming from the host CBP,
and the greenish emission around 510 nm (see Figure 7) was not explainable as both compounds did
not near 500 nm. Only the emission from BC-CY6 was near
495 nm, but the similar emission from both devices aroused the suspiciousness
in the EL spectra. Further, as the dye percentage was increased in
devices, the blue emission diminished completely and the origin around
525–538 nm was observed for 1-iv, 1-V, 2-iv, and 2-V (7–10%
doping).Because the behavior of EL was similar in both the devices
utilizing BC-CY6/BC-LTH, it was, for sure,
expected that the emission originated from the similar type of interactions
in the OLED devices. Moreover, the shift to greenish emission (device
1-V, 2-V) from the combination of blue and greenish emission (device
1-i, 2-i) is clearly a case of exciplex emission.34,35

OLED device architecture used for guest molecules (BC-CY6 and BC-LTH) in host 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP).

Figure 7 EL spectra for the OLED devices using BC-CY6 and BC-LTH with various doping concentrations.

It is possible that the emission originated at BC-CY6/CBP and BC-LTH/CBP interfaces because
of the relaxation
of the electron from the LUMO of the dye to the HOMO of the CBP layer.36−38 We expect that the electronic relaxation at the LUMO level of the
dye may not be possible because of the deep-lying LUMO of the dyes.
The respective I–V–L data are shown in Figure 8 and Table 1. Device 1-ii showed an operating voltage (OV) of less than
5 V with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.0%, whereas device
2-ii showed a little high OV of 5.8 V with EQE of 0.9%; but the EQE
dropped rapidly for devices 2-iv and 2-V compared to 2-iii, whereas
device 1-V showed an EQE of 0.5%. In brief, the functionalized BC-LTH dye showed better device performance than BC-CY6 when used as a guest emitting material in OLED devices.

3 Conclusions
The concept of coadsorbent molecules in preventing the molecular
dyes from getting aggregated in solid state and attaining nonefficient
PL behavior was accepted. As a result, the covalently bonded molecular
dyes with a bulky coadsorbent unit (modified lithocholic derivative, BC-LTH) were designed and synthesized, and their effect on
controlling stacking interactions on the molecular level of a planar/disc-type
coumarin system was studied. The results of the multicyclic aliphatic
coadsorbent substituent were also compared with the monocyclic cyclohexyl-substituted
compound (BC-CY6). It was observed that the bulkier lithocholic
ring system was able to prevent stacking interactions and also provided
a small Stokes shift in solid-state emission compared to the BC-CY6 compound. The small Stokes shift signifies that there
exist minimum interactions between neighboring molecules with enhanced
intermolecular distances. Excimer or dimer formation was also not
observed with BC-LTH and also showed enhanced efficiency
both in solid-state emission and OLED device configuration. Thus,
the present manuscript provides a strategy to prevent solid-state
intense packing and may help in designing noble planar/disc-type solid-state
emitters for practical applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX NMR spectrometer. FTIR
spectra of neat samples were recorded on a Carry-660 spectrophotometer.
HRMS-electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra were recorded on a Bruker
maXis impact HD instrument. UV–vis and fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 and a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer,
respectively. Solid-state emission was recorded by preparing a thin
film of compounds on a quartz plate using the drop-cast method. Solvents
and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further purification. Spectroscopic grade solvents were used for photophysical
studies. Melting points were recorded using a Stuart melting point
instrument. TGA was performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 and NETZSCH
STA449 F1 Jupiter instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating
rate of 10 °C per minute. The temperature of degradation (Td) was correlated with a 5% weight loss. SC-XRD
studies were performed on an Agilent Technologies X-ray diffractometer.
3D structure visualization and exploration of crystal packing were
done using Mercury software. The absolute quantum yields (both solid
and solution state) were calculated using an integrating sphere on
a Fluorolog instrument (Horiba Scientific). DCM solutions of compounds
were used to calculate the absolute quantum yield. The lifetime data
were measured on an Agilent lifetime instrument.

4.2 Computational Details
Gaussian 09
suit of program was used to carry out the computational studies. In
terms of the basis set, B3LYP-6-31g(d,p) was used to optimize the
geometries. Once the structures were optimized, the TD-DFT approach
was utilized to calculate the respective singlet–singlet transition
energies. The geometries were optimized in the gaseous state, and
no solvent interactions were included in the studies. The dimer form
of BC-CY6 was optimized using the geometry in the SC-XRD
data. Structure visualization was done using GaussView and ChemCraft
software.

4.3 CV
CV was carried out in nitrogen-purged
DCM (oxidation scan) at room temperature on a Metrohm Autolab electrochemical
workstation. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The conventional
three-electrode configuration consists of a platinum disc working
electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, with ferrocenium–ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) as
the external standard. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at scan
rate of 100 mV s–1 in DCM solutions.

4.4 Device Fabrication
All devices were
fabricated on a precleaned glass substrate coated with a 125 nm indium
tin oxide (ITO) layer. The fabrication process initially involved
spin-coating of an aqueous solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT–PSS) at 4000 rpm for 20 s to form a 35 nm hole-injection
layer on the ITO anode. The emissive layer consisted of host CBP doped
with dopant BC-LTH or BC-CY6. The following
emissive layer solution (ELS) was prepared by dissolving the host
and guest materials in the solvent THF and then sonicated for 30 min.
The resulting EML solution was spin-coated on the hole-injection layer
at 2500 rpm for 20 s under nitrogen-purging conditions. A 32 nm electron-transporting
layer of 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene
(TPBi), a 1 nm electron injection layer of lithium fluoride (LiF),
and a 130 nm layer of aluminum (Al) as cathode were deposited by using
the thermal evaporation method in a high-vacuum chamber at rates of
0.3, 0.1, and 10 Å s–1, respectively. The current
density–voltage and luminance (I–V–L) characteristics of the resultant
devices were measured through a Keithley 2400 electrometer with a
Minolta CS-100A luminance meter, whereas the spectrum and CIE color
chromatic coordinates were measured using a PR-655 spectroradiometer.
The emission area of the devices was 25 mm2, and the luminance
in the forward direction was measured.
