A library of metallo-bipyridine UiO-type
metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) has been successfully synthesized by postmetallation of a wide
range of metal complexes into bidentate bipyridine moieties. Then,
a systematic investigation is devoted to a catalytic evaluation of
the resultant MOFs containing a binary Lewis acid function for the
synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide (CO2). The result indicated that the metal-grafted MOFs exhibit
improvement in terms of CO2 uptake capacity and catalytic
activity in comparison with their nonmetallated counterparts. The
comprehensive investigation provides a valuable insight into the synergetic
effects of MOF functionalities including metal node, grafted metal,
and its counterion in the cycloaddition reaction. Furthermore, the
metal coordination modulation due to its benefits such as being a
solvent-free process, nearly full conversion to cyclic carbonates,
high selectivity and high CO2 uptake, applying atmospheric
CO2 pressure, and excellent stability and easy recyclability
of the catalyst demonstrates them as promising candidates for practical
utilization of CO2 conversion into value-added chemicals.

Introduction
The growing CO2 level as a result of anthropogenic activities
has triggered global warming and climate change. On the other hand,
CO2 represents itself as an abundant and cheap source of
C1 building block for producing numerous fine chemicals such as formic
acid, carbon monoxide, cyclic carbonates, and others.1−4 Therefore, on the way toward a low carbon society and exploitation
of a renewable carbon economy, selective adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent chemical transformations are areas of intense
current interest.5−10 In this sense, the synthesis of cyclic carbonate from CO2 and epoxide considered the most effective utilization of CO2 featuring a highly atom-economical reaction with minimal
byproducts.11−18 Thus far, different types of catalysts developed for chemical CO2 fixation with epoxides, including homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysts.19−25 Heterogeneous catalysts are superior to homogeneous catalysts in
terms of product purification and the catalytic recovery process.26,27 Among them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are recognized
as promising tools in the field of CO2 conversion.28,29 MOFs are porous materials constructed from organic struts linked
by metal nodes.30 Compared to traditional
porous compounds, the modular nature of MOF functionalities driven
from a rational combination of organic ligands and metal nodes endows
tunable catalytic performance, adjustable porosity, and desirable
topology.31,32 However, most of the CO2 transformations
under utility of MOFs suffer from all or at least one either of limitations
such as long reaction time, solvent assistant, high CO2 pressure, and harsh reaction conditions, thus requiring high energy
and capital costs. Thus, to circumvent the drawbacks, there is still
a strong need for the de novo design of more efficient MOFs.33−37 Generally, MOFs take advantage of Lewis/Bronsted acid activation
modes of metal nodes. Nevertheless, some modulations are invented
to improve the CO2 capture and conversion by incorporation
of either open metal sites (Lewis acid) or N-donors (Lewis base) to
activate epoxide and CO2, respectively (Figure 1).38−41 Postmetallation of organic linkers
with transition metals is emerging as an enabling trick to tune the
catalytic properties of MOFs.38−40 As a result, the grafted metal
ion serves as an additional Lewis acid center that profoundly affects
the chemical, electrochemical, and porous capacity of the whole MOF
system. From a mechanistic point of view, the initial step in MOF
catalysis of CO2 transformation into cyclic carbonate involves
epoxide activation by an acid catalyst.38−42 Additionally, computational coupled with an experimental
study by Morris and co-workers revealed that the open metal center
in the metallo ligand acts as the primary Lewis acid site to facilitate
CO2 conversion.38,40 Hence, as the acidic
function can be supplied from both metal nodes and metallo ligand
linkers, it is conceivable that simultaneous presence of the dual
Lewis acid function can further increase the efficiency of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonates. However, literature survey
reveals that there is a scarce of investigation in this regard. In
2017, Demir et al. concluded that postmetalation of UiO-type zirconium
MOFs with vanadium leads to inferior CO2 conversion to
their nonmetallated counterparts.39 The
low efficiency of the modulated MOFs is attributed to the reduction
of surface area and pore volume as a result of postmetalation. In
comparison, Zhu et al. evidenced that grafting the secondary open
metal site into cyclam-based zirconium MOFs (VPI-100) is efficient.38,40

of MOF activation modes for epoxides and CO2.

N-heterocyclic ligands due to the presence
of
Lewis basic sites in the pores and surface are able to coordinate,
trap, and interact with hazardous gaseous metal ions and other chemicals.43−45 Bipyridines are bidentate nitrogen ligands with rich coordination
chemistry. A combination of the versatility of this moiety with high
porosity and stability of MOFs leads to efficient systems, namely
Bipy-UiO-67.

In this context, we report a postmetallation strategy
for the synthesis
of a novel series of Hf/Zr-Bipy-UiO-67(ML2) (M = Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and
L = OAc–, NO3–, and Cl–) and its
catalytic evaluation for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxide
and CO2 under mild conditions (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study that systematically investigates the synergy of the
metal node/M/L on the catalytic activity of MOFs for CO2 utilization. It is demonstrated that the judicious choice of the
metal node/M/L composite not only enhanced CO2 capacity
uptake but also improves the catalytic activity.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Metal-Grafted Hf/Zr-Bipy-UiO-67
MOFs
As we mentioned earlier, a series of postmetallated
Bipy-UiO-67 MOFs,
including Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Cu(OAc)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Co(OAc)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Zn(OAc)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(NO3)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Cu(NO3)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Co(NO3)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Zn(NO3)2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(MnCl2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(CuCl2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(CoCl2), Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(ZnCl2), Zr-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2), Zr-Bipy-UiO-67(Cu(OAc)2), Zr-Bipy-UiO-67(MnCl2), and Zr-Bipy-UiO-67(CuCl2), was prepared under
solvothermal reactions. The phase purity of the resulting MOFs was
confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments. The PXRD
patterns exhibited the isoreticular and crystalline nature of these
MOFs. The full PXRD patterns of MOFs are given in the Supporting Information. During the evaluation
of the catalytic performance of the metal-grafted UiO-67 MOFs in CO2 fixation reactions, Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) acts
as the best catalyst. Thus, in the following, full characterization
of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) is discussed in detail. The
PXRD pattern of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) indicated that
similar to pristine MOFs, the crystallinity was well retained after
postmetallation (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 (a) PXRD patterns of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2). (b) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67
and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2). (c) Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) profiles of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2). (d) Adsorption and desorption isotherms of N2 at 77
K for Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated
that the morphologies
of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) are cubic
and spherical nanoparticles, respectively (Figure 2b). To evaluate the thermal stability of
these MOFs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) investigation was conducted
in an air atmosphere (Figure 2c). The TGA curve of the MOFs showed that decomposition of
Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 starts from up to 500 °C, while that of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) starts at near 400 °C. These data illustrate the excellent
chemical and thermal stability of the best catalyst.

The permanent
porosity parameter was tested by N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at 77 K (Figure 2d). Similar to Hf-Bipy-UiO-67, Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) due to the observation of the type I isotherm was identified
as a microporous material. The N2 adsorption amounts of
Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.1) and high relative
pressure (P/P0 < 0.99)
were 255 and 358 cm3 g–1, respectively.
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas for Hf-Bipy-UiO-67
and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) were obtained as 1040 and
637.32 m2 g–1, respectively. Furthermore,
the Langmuir surface areas for Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) were calculated to be 1797.5 and 1098.98 m2 g–1, respectively. Additionally, to investigate the CO2 uptake capacity, we performed CO2 adsorption of
Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) at 298 K (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 2d, the CO2 uptake value for Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) at 800 mmHg
pressure is 8.6 cm3 g–1, while this value
is dramatically decreased to 5.1 cm3 g–1 for Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2).

isotherms of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) in 298 K.

The atomic ratio of manganese
(Mn) in Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) was analyzed by inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES). As expected, for each of the Hf atom in the
UiO-67 cluster, there is one doped Mn atom, and thus, the ICP result
exhibited an atomic ratio of 1:0.31 wt % (Hf/Mn).

Catalytic Cycloaddition
of CO2 and Epoxide
Due to the high density of
the Lewis acid sites on the afforded MOFs
and its capability of highly selective sorption of CO2,
we decided to evaluate the catalytic performance of the corresponding
MOFs as bidentate Lewis acid catalysts to proceed the synthesis of
cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides. The synthesis
of 1,3-dioxolane-2-one from epichlorohydrin (ECH) was selected as
a model reaction, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The solvent-free reactions
were conducted at room temperature using CO2 (1 bar), ECH
(4.3 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) (8 mol %), and 1 mol
% of various homogeneous and heterogeneous (MOF) catalysts for 12
h, and the resulting mixtures were analyzed by 1H NMR to
find the efficiency of the reactions based on conversion (see the Supporting Information). As seen in Table 1, employing heterogeneous
Bipy-UiO-67 MOFs bearing Zr and Hf nodes led to good conversions (Table 1, entries 1 and 2).
In comparison, screening the separate sections of these MOFs (homogeneous)
including 2,2′-Bipy-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid (Bronsted
acid/Lewis base), ZrCl4 (Lewis acid), and HfCl4 (Lewis acid) led to a dramatic decrease in conversion (Table 1, entries 3–5),
demonstrating the versatility of the MOF system. Next, the effects
of postmetallation on Zr- and Hf-based Bipy-UiO-67 MOFs were investigated
(Table 1, entries 6–21).
Accordingly, Zr/Hf-Bipy-UiO-67 grafted by chlorine salts of Mn, Cu,
Co, and Zn exhibited very poor catalytic performance (ranges of 43–49%)
compared to the nongrafted counterparts (compare the conversions of
entries 1 and 2 with 6–11). However, trying the reaction by
replacing the nitrate salt of metals was shown to be effective as
moderate to good conversions were obtained (Table 1, entries 12–15). Among them, using
Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Co(NO3)2) and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Zn(NO3)2) afforded superior results of 84 and 86% conversions,
respectively (Table 1, entries 14 and 15). Next, observing the effects of metal counterions
on this reaction, we further developed our study by evaluating the
incorporation of acetate salt of the metals into Zr/Hf-Bipy-UiO-67
MOFs (Table 1, entries
16–21). As the result indicates, moderate to high conversion
was achieved and Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) with >99%
conversion
is recognized as the best catalyst for the synthesis of the desired
cyclic carbonate (Table 1, entry 18). To gain knowledge on the efficiency of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2), the reaction was carried out by using Mn(OAc)2, in which the resulting conversion significantly decreased to 43%
(Table 1, entry 22).

run at least three times, and the reported data are averages.

resonance (NMR) in CDCl3.

Careful looking of the overall results reveals that
the kind of
metal node and grafted metal complexes can greatly affect the catalytic
activity of MOFs. Accordingly, Hf-based MOFs are more efficient than
Zr-based MOFs in each of Cl, NO3, and OAc reactionary collections.
The more oxophilic nature of Hf relative to Zr could account for this
observation.46 Also, it is demonstrated
that the catalytic conversions of MOFs that are grafted by M(NO3)2 and M(OAc)2 are more than double
that by M(Cl)2. This phenomenon is attributed to the resonance
characteristic in NO3 and OAc ligands. As a result, the
metal centers in these ligands feel more electron deficiency and tends
to bind oxygen to nonelectron pairs of epoxides tightly.47

After the demonstration of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2)
as the best catalyst, attention was paid to investigate the optimum
set of the reaction conditions (Table 2). First, the amount of co-catalyst loading was evaluated,
and it was found that a gradual increase in the loading amount of
TBAB from 1 to 8% led to an increase in the conversion from 11 to
99% (Table 2, entries
1–6). Next, lowering the loading amount of the catalyst from
1 to 0.5% remarkably decreased the conversion to 38% (Table 2, entry 7). Therefore, it can
be concluded that increasing the efficiency and amount of the catalyst
is a directly proportional variation. In other words, increasing the
concentration of the catalytic site improves the catalytic conversion.
Also, it is realized that the presence of TBAB is critical for this
transformation as the trace amount of the desired adduct was detected
in the absence of the co-catalyst (Table 2, entry 9). Thus, it is disclosed that both
the catalyst and TBAB have a dispensable role in this reaction. Running
the reaction under heat conditions (50 °C) reduced the reaction
time to 8 h without affecting the efficiency (Table 2, entry 8). However, for saving energy, the
reaction was conducted at ambient temperature. Notably, for all of
the reactions, no trace of the common byproducts such as 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol
or polycarbonates was observed. Eventually, using 1 mol % Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) and 8 mol % TBAB at room temperature for 12 h was established
as the ideal condition (Table 2, entry 6).

Having identified the
advantages of the catalytic activity of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2), we assumed it worthwhile to compare the efficiency of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) to the earlier reported metal-immobilized MOFs in CO2 fixation into ECH (Table 3). As summarized in Table 3, compared to MOF-53-VCl3/VCl4 as bipyridine UiO-type MOFs and metal-cyclam-based Zr/Hf
MOFs denoted VPI-100, Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) herein exhibits
significant progress in terms of high conversion, mild reaction conditions,
and low CO2 pressure. Having obtained the optimal conditions
(Table 2, entry 6),
the combinatorial potential of the described procedure was investigated
by using a range of epoxides (Table 4). In comparison to ECH, it can be seen that with an
increase of the substituent bulk of epoxide substrates, the conversion
of the desired cyclic carbonates dramatically decreased under room
temperature conditions (Table 4, compare the conversion of entry 1 with entries 3, 5, 7,
9, and 11). This could be attributed to the steric effect of pores
in Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) with large-size epoxides, which
affects the diffusion rate of substrates and results in a decrease
of conversion. To prove this claim, a control experiment was set for
conversion of styrene oxide using HfCl4/TBAB as the homogeneous
catalyst. According to our experiment, 34% conversion of styrene carbonate
was achieved under the optimized conditions obtained for ECH (Supporting Information, Figure S44). This result
evidenced that bulky epoxides are sensitive to the hindrance effect
of pores and reactions are taking place inside the pores.

(4.3 mmol), 1 bar CO2.

To circumvent the hurdle of efficiency for bulkier
epoxides, and
knowing that the catalytic activity of Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2) is compatible under heat conditions (Table 2, entry 8), the reactions of the bulky epoxides
were carried out at 50 °C. Gratefully, except 2-butyloxirane
with 95% conversion (Table 4, entry 10), all of the applied epoxides afforded the desired
cyclic carbonates in nearly full conversion (Table 4, entries 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12).

To
investigate the heterogeneity and stability of Hf-Bipy-UiO-67(Mn(OAc)2), leaching and recyclability tests in the reaction of ECH
and CO2 were performed. As shown in Figure 4a, no significant decrease was observed in
the conversion of the reaction after five cycles. Due to its high
chemical stability, the recovered catalyst maintained the entirety
of the MOF and crystallinity after each cycle as indicated by PXRD
(Figure 4b). By filtration
of the catalyst from the batch after 2 h, no catalytic activity was
observed, which means that no leaching of catalytically active sites
occurred (Figure 4c).

Conclusions
In
summary, a series of metallo-bipyridine UiO-type MOFs based
on Zr and Hf metal clusters was synthesized by a postmetallation approach.
A comprehensive investigation of the effect of embedded metals (Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Zn2+)
and counterions (OAc–, NO3–, and Cl–) on
the catalytic activities of the resulting MOFs was performed. The
result revealed that the combination of catalytically active open
metal sites, counterions, and unsaturated metal nodes significantly
enhances the catalytic performance of the cycloaddition reaction.
Additionally, the kind of counterion is an effective factor for the
catalytic function of embedded metals as Lewis acid sites. Significantly,
the result clearly showed that bulky epoxides are so sensitive to
the hindrance effect of pores, and thus, the reaction is taking place
inside the pores. Due to their outstanding chemical and thermal stability,
these MOFs are good candidates for the catalytic reaction of CO2 conversion under mild conditions.

Experimental Section
General
The organic ligand 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic
acid (BipyDC) and the metal salts were purchased and used without
further purification from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa
Aesar, TCI, and others). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra
(4000–400 cm–1) were collected in the solid
state on a BOMEM- MB102 spectrometer using potassium bromide pellets.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were performed on a Stöe
StadiVari θ/θ powder X-ray diffractometer equipped with
a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα at 50 kV and 50 mA. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out under continuous air flow and recorded
on an SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating
rate of 20 °C per min (25–900 °C). NMR spectra were
recorded on a Brüker DPX-300 spectrometer at 300 MHz for 1H NMR and data for 1H NMR are collected in CDCl3 as follows: chemical shift (ppm), multiplicity (s, singlet;
d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quarter; m, multiplet), coupling constant
(Hz), and integration referenced to the appropriate solvent peak or
0 ppm for TMS. The dinitrogen (N2) adsorption isotherm
was measured at 77 K using a liquid-N2 bath. The CO2 adsorption isotherm was carried out at 298 K using a water
bath. SEM images were taken on Hitachi SU 3500. Inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES 730-ES, Varian) was
used for determination of the atomic ratio of Hf and Mn. Zr/Hf-Bipy-UiO-67
MOFs were prepared following the reported procedures.48,49

General Procedure for the
Catalytic Cycloaddition of Epoxides
with CO2
The reactions were conducted under solvent-free
conditions in a glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The
corresponding epoxides (4.3 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB)
(8 mol %), and the catalysts (1 mol %, based on open metal sites)
were added to a glass reactor under 1 bar pressure of CO2 for the desired temperatures and times. After each catalytic reaction,
the catalyst was separated by centrifugation, and the resulting product
was analyzed by 1H NMR. For examining the reusability of
the MOFs, after centrifugation, the MOFs were washed with MeOH three
times and subsequently activated under a vacuum oven at 90 °C
overnight. The afforded MOFs were used for the second run of the reaction.

Leaching Test
After 2 h of the reaction, the catalyst
was separated from the reactor by a syringe. Then, the reaction was
continued under free-catalyst conditions for 9 h. The 1H NMR results clearly demonstrated that the catalyst was completely
heterogeneous and no further increase in the conversion of the reaction
was observed.
