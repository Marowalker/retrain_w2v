This
work describes the preparation of a series of platinum–aminocarbene
complexes [PtCl{C(N=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONb))=N(H)R1}(CNR1)]a–b (8–19, 65–75% isolated yield) via
the reaction of cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] (R1 = Cy 1, t-Bu 2, Xyl 3, 2-Cl-6-MeC6H34) with 3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones HN=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONbH) (R2–R5 = H 5; R3 = Me, R2, R4, R5 = H 6; R3, R4 = Cl, R2, R5 = H 7). New complexes 17–19 were characterized
by elemental analyses (C, H, N), ESI+-MS, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), one-dimensional (1H, 13C{1H}), and two-dimensional (1H,1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC)/1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC))
NMR spectroscopy, and authenticity of known species 8–16 was confirmed by FT-IR and 1H
and 13C{1H} NMR. Complexes 8–19 were assessed as catalysts for hydrosilylation of terminal
alkynes with hydrosilanes to give vinyl silanes, and complex [PtCl{C(N=Ca(C6H3(5-Me)CONb))=N(H)(2-Cl-6-MeC6H3)}{CN(2-Cl-6-MeC6H3)}]a−b (18) showed the highest catalytic activity. The
catalytic system proposed operates at 80–100 °C for 4–6
h in toluene and with catalyst loading of 0.1 mol %, enabling the
reaction of a number of terminal alkynes (PhC≡CH, t-BuC≡CH, and 4-(t-Bu)C6H4C≡CH) with hydrosilanes (Et3SiH, Pr3SiH, i-Pr3SiH, and PhMe2SiH).
Target vinyl silanes were prepared in 48–95% yields (as a mixture
of α/β isomers) and with maximum turnover number of 8.4
× 103. Hydrosilylation of internal alkynes (PhC≡CPh,
Me(CH2)2C≡C(CH2)2Me, and PhC≡CMe) with hydrosilanes (Et3SiH, PhMe2SiH) led to the corresponding trisubstituted silylated alkenes
in 86–94% yields. Initial observations on the mechanism of
the catalytic action of platinum–ADC catalysts 8–19 suggested a molecular catalytic cycle.

Introduction
Metal complexes with
acyclic diaminocarbenes ([M]ADCs) have proven
to be a valuable alternative to metal-N-heterocyclic
carbene ([M]NHCs) catalysts in contemporary transition metal catalysis.1 Both ADCs and NHCs possess a powerful combination
of strong donor abilities with a wide range of steric properties and
akin binding characteristics upon coordination.2 From the synthetic perspective, a general approach to [M]NHCs
involves the direct coordination of the in situ generated free NHCs
to a metal center, whereas the most versatile route to [M]ADCs involves
metal-mediated nucleophilic addition to isocyanides (Scheme 1).1a,2a The latter template approach allows for an upfront installation
of a variety of functionalities within the generated acyclic aminocarbene
ligand, resulting in an efficient variation of electronic and steric
properties, denticity of the carbene ligand, and eventually the catalytic
properties of metal–ADCs.1b,1c This methodology
can also be used for the preparation of [M]NHCs, although in this
case, the application of prefunctionalized isocyanides3 and specific nucleophiles2c is
required.

Scheme 1 Routes to [M]NHCs and [M]ADCs
Insofar as generation of [M]ADCs is concerned, different
types
of nucleophiles have been successfully added to metal-bound isocyanides,
including amines, hydrazines (sp3-N),
alcohols (sp3-O), imines (sp2-N), imidines, amidines, hydrazides, and hydrazones (mixed sp3-N/sp2-N).1a,1b,2c,4 Coupling
with mixed sp3-N/sp2-N nucleophiles led to unconventional amino(imino)- or amino(hydrazido)carbenes.5 It is noteworthy that application of these easily accessible
and modular ADC species in catalysis allowed the discovery of new
application fields, where metal–ADC catalysts were never used
previously. For instance, recently prepared palladium–amino(hydrazido)carbenes derived from the addition of hydrazides
exhibit an excellent activity in the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction
conducted in aqueous medium5b and also
in Sonogashira coupling performed at room temperature (RT).5h At the same time, we reported on the first use
of platinum–ADCs in catalysis, viz., for the catalytic hydrosilylation
of terminal alkynes with hydrosilanes.5h

Whereas catalytic properties of different palladium and gold–ADCs
are well-documented, the application of platinum–ADCs in catalysis
is restricted to only a few reports on catalytic alkyne hydrosilylation.1b,5h We have recently revealed that amino(imino)carbene–palladium
complexes derived from the addition of 3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones to
palladium-bound isocyanides demonstrate a high efficiency in the Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling (yields up to 81–99%, turnover numbers (TONs) up to
7.6 × 104).5d

Inspired
by these results, we prepared corresponding platinum–aminocarbene
derivatives and assessed their catalytic properties in a substantially
more demanding reaction such as hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes.

Synthesis and Structural Characterization

Reaction of platinum(II)-isocyanides cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] (R1 = cyclohexyl

HN=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONbH) (R2–R5 = H 5;
R3 = Me, R2, R4, R5 =
H 6; R3, R4 = Cl, R2, R5 = H 7) in CHCl3 under reflux
conditions for 8 h gave platinum–aminocarbene complexes [PtCl{C(N=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONb))=N(H)R1}(CNR1)]a−b (8–19) that were isolated
in 65–75% yield (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Preparation of Platinum–ADC Complexes via Coupling
of 3-Iminoisoindolin-1-ones
(5–7) with cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] (1–4)
Complexes 17–19 were characterized
using elemental analyses (C, H, N), ESI+-MS, Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, whereas the authenticity of known5a species 8–16 was established using FT-IR and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR. Satisfactory C, H, and N elemental analyses were obtained
for 17–19 and ESI+-MS
for those showed peaks due to protonation of molecular ion [M + H]+. In the FT-IR spectra of 17–19, bands due to ν(Ccarbene–N) and ν(N–H)
appeared within 1523–1521 and 3248–3227 cm–1 ranges, respectively. A strong ν(C≡N) stretch due to
the presence of the unreacted isocyanide ligand was found at ca. 2193
cm–1, whereas the corresponding bands due to overlapped
ν(C=O) and ν(C=N) of the 3-iminoisoindolin-1-one
moiety emerged between 1734 and 1611 cm–1. The 1H NMR spectra of carbene complexes 17–19 displayed a broad peak in the range of δ 9.7–11.4,
assigned to the Pt-{Ccarbene–N(H)R} proton, whereas the corresponding signal of the carbene carbon
in the 13C{1H} spectra resonated at ca. 200–207
ppm. Gradient-enhanced 1H,1H correlation spectroscopy
(COSY), 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum
correlation (HMQC)/1H,13C heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC), and 1H,13C heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra aided the 1H and 13C signal assignment in 17–19. All spectroscopic and nonspectroscopic features of 17–19 match those of other platinum and palladium
complexes, i.e., [MCl{C(N=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONb))=N(H)R1}(CNR1)]a−b reported previously by some of us.5a,5d

Application of Platinum–Aminocarbene Complexes as Catalysts
for Hydrosilylation of Alkynes
Hydrosilylation of terminal
alkynes has become one of the most powerful ways for the preparation
of organosilane species,6 which are useful
intermediates in several synthetic transformations, including Hiyama,
Hosomi–Sakurai-type allylation, and others.7 Despite being extensively studied, only a few types of
catalysts are generally used for this process, in particular for industrial
applications. Two commonly employed catalysts for the hydrosilylation
reaction in the industry include Speier’s catalyst (H2PtCl6 in i-PrOH) or Karstedt’s
catalyst Pt2(dvtms)2 (dvtms: divinyltetramethylsiloxane).8 Despite the popularity and the broad application
scope, these catalysts suffer from a number of disadvantages and,
over the past years, alternative platinum catalysts for alkyne hydrosilylation
were described. These include platinum complexes with NHC ligands
that work in toluene at 100 °C with 1.0 mol % catalyst loading9 or mixed platinum complexes with NHC and dvtms
ligands that operate in o-xylene at 80 °C.10 Recently, we reported on the first application
of the [Pt]ADC species as catalysts for alkyne hydrosilylation,5h and in the development of this project, we assessed
complexes 8–19 for this purpose.

Reaction of phenylacetylene with triethylsilane affording a mixture
of vinyl silanes was chosen as a model hydrosilylation system (Scheme 3). Under the catalytic
conditions specified below, the formation of only triethyl(1-phenylvinyl)silane
(α product) and (E)-triethyl(styryl)silane
(β-(E) product) was observed and no (Z)-triethyl(styryl)silane (β-(Z)
product) was detected.

Scheme 3 Model System for Hydrosilylation of Terminal
Alkynes with Silanes
Although the formation of three isomers is possible in
a such reaction,
the majority of previous reports indicate that platinum-catalyzed
hydrosilylation of alkynes typically brings about the formation of
two isomers, namely, α and β-(E) products.
Three isomers are also expected for the process involving radical
pathways.9a,11

From the industrial perspective, it
is important to develop a catalytic
system that can run in undried solvents in air. Therefore, we started
this project by assessing the effects of solvent and the presence
of moisture and air on the course of the hydrosilylation process.
Conditions previously reported by some of us for other platinum–ADC
catalysts were used (catalyst loading 0.1 mol %, 80 °C for 6
h and/or 100 °C for 4 h).9a Several
dry and undried solvents were used in air or under a dinitrogen atmosphere,
and the results for runs in air are presented in Table 1.

1 equiv), catalyst 18 (5.0 ×
10–7 mol); solvent (0.5 mL).

b Yields of products were determined
by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 1,2-dimethoxyethane as standard,
whereas the isomeric content was determined on the basis of the alkene
coupling constants.

c Water
content in this solvent was
0.1% (v/v) based upon Karl Fischer coulometry.

No marked difference was observed
between dried and undried toluene
as the reaction medium (entries 1–4), and overall yields of
the product of 82–90% were achieved at both 80 and 100 °C.
Use of p-xylene (entries 5 and 6) resulted in the
decrease of the product yield to 67% at 80 °C, whereas the reaction
course at 100 °C seemed to be unaffected. We believe the major
reason for this is the insufficient solubility of catalysts and substrates
at lower temperatures. Application of ethanol or water as the solvent
(entries 7–10) was unsuccessful, and only traces of the vinyl
silanes were detected. In this case, a mixture of starting hydrosilanes
alongside the products of their hydrolysis or alcoholysis (formed
upon reaction with water or EtOH, correspondingly)12 was generated. Finally, fairly surprising results were
obtained without any solvent (entries 11 and 12). Moderate product
yields (ca. 64–65%) were subsequently achieved, showing the
potential of development of this system into a solvent-free one. When
reaction in toluene was attempted under a dinitrogen atmosphere under
the conditions of Table 1, no change in the product yield was detected, showing that the system
is not influenced by the presence of air. For further studies in this
report, all catalytic runs were performed in air with undried toluene
as the solvent.

As the next step, we verified the effect of
temperature (60–100
°C range) on the model reaction (Table 2). At RT, no catalytic reaction occurred
and only the mixture of starting materials was recovered after 48
h. At 60 °C, the maximum yield of 37% were achieved after 4 h
and no further accumulation of the products was observed even after
12 h of heating (entries 1, 4, 7, and 10). We observed that in this
case the reaction stops at conversion of ca. 40% and the unreacted
starting material remains in the reaction mixture. At 80 °C,
nearly quantitative conversion of the starting material was achieved
to afford silylated products with yields up to 90% after 6 h (entry
8). The same process at 100 °C led to the maximum yield of 85%
achieved after 4 h. Increasing the reaction time (entries 9, 11, and
12) did not further improve the yield but resulted in the partial
decomposition of the silylated products; this process occurred faster
at 100 °C when compared to that at 80 °C. Monitoring of
this reaction by 1H NMR and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed the detection of styrene and triethyl(vinyl)silane.
We believe that these species are formed in a similar fashion as reported
by Marciniec13 and Seki,14 who showed that metal hydride complexes, that can be generated
in situ from the hydrosilanes and metal source, can catalyze the conversion
of vinyl silanes to styrene. Taking these results into account, all
further catalytic tests were undertaken at two sets of temperature/reaction
time, i.e., at 80 °C/6 h and 100 °C/4 h.

A comparison of the catalytic activity of all prepared
aminocarbene
complexes 8–19 in the model hydrosilylation
system is given in Table 3. All catalysts studied are scarcely selective for Markovnikov
versus anti-Markovnikov addition to alkyne. Complex 18 was the most active (entries 21 and 22; 85–90% products yield),
closely followed by complexes 15 and 16 (entries
15–18; 81–83%), 14 (entries 13–14;
49–82%), 17 (entries 19–20; 42–80%),
and 19 (entries 23–24; 41–75%). For 14–19, a nearly quantitative conversion
of the starting material was achieved at 100 °C; the same was
also observed with catalysts 15, 16, and 18 at 80 °C. For all other catalysts and conditions,
an incomplete conversion of the starting materials occurs and the
reaction stops presumably due to the deactivation of the catalyst.

All of the most efficient catalysts 14–19 are derived from the coupling of aryl isocyanides
in cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] [R1 = Xyl 3, 2-Cl-6-MeC6H34] with 3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones, whereas less
active
catalysts 8–13 are derived from the
addition to the aliphatic isocyanides. These results are also in agreement
with those previously observed for the corresponding palladium complexes
with amino(imino)carbenes derived from the addition
of 3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones to palladium-bound isocyanides that were
studied as catalysts for the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction.5d We believe that in this case both steric and
electronic factors might be responsible for this effect. From the
steric perspective, planar aromatic groups in both XylCN and 2-Cl-6-MeC6H3NC exhibit lower hindrance upon oxidative addition
of silane substrates, particularly at a lower temperature. From the
electronic viewpoint, moderate electron donation from the aminocarbenes
derived from the aromatic isocyanides to the metal center makes it
more susceptible to reductive elimination of the silylated product.
It is also known that many carbene ligands with aromatic substituents
exhibit superior stability when compared to that of the aliphatic
counterpart that might also account for a plausible reason for their
superior catalytic efficiency. More examples of the catalyst structure/catalytic
activity relationship for metal–ADCs are required before more
definitive conclusions can be drawn.

We assessed the scope of
our system (Table 4) using representative catalyst 18. A selection of terminal
alkynes (PhC≡CH, 4-(t-Bu)C6H4C≡CH, and t-BuC≡CH) and silanes
(Et3SiH, Pr3SiH,
PhMe2SiH, and i-Pr3SiH) with
different steric hindrances and electronic properties was used, thus
attesting the versatility of our system for the preparation of corresponding
vinyl silane products.

b Yields of products were determined
by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the
standard, whereas the isomeric content was determined on the basis
of the alkene coupling constants.

c Reaction temperature: 100 °C.

Yields of vinyl silanes were up to 96%. For aliphatic
terminal
alkyne t-BuC≡CH, moderate product yields were
achieved presumably due to its lower reactivity when compared to that
of aromatic alkynes. For some of the alkyne/silane pairs, the variation
of the reaction time and temperature gave higher product yields when
compared to those under the standard conditions of 80 °C/6 h
and 100 °C/4 h.

To extend the application scope for our
system, we also assessed
the hydrosilylation of internal alkynes (Table 5).15 To our satisfaction,
we observed that symmetric disubstituted acetylenes (entries 1–4)
react with silanes with a high degree of stereoselectivity to afford
target E-silylated alkenes in 86–92% yields
after 4 h at 100 °C. For asymmetrically disubstituted alkynes
(entries 5 and 6), an expected mixture of α/β-E-silylated alkenes is generated. For all of these examples,
the amount of corresponding Z-silylated products
formed was below 1%.

b Yields of products were determined
by 1H NMR spectroscopy using 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the

of matching of chemical shifts against the authentic compounds.

The effect of catalyst loading has
been assessed in the model hydrosilylation
reaction with terminal alkynes (Table 6). The maximum catalyst turnover number (TON) of 8.4
× 103 was achieved with 0.01 mol % loading of 18 within
6 h of reaction at 80 °C (entry 5). With higher catalyst loadings
(entries 1–4, 0.1–1.0 mol %), no considerable improvement
in the yield was achieved, whereas with lower catalyst loadings (entries
7–10, 0.001–0.0001 mol %), only traces of products were
detected.

mechanism of catalytic action of 8–19. A catalytic run in the presence of metallic mercury (mercury drop
test16) showed similar results to those
in the absence of mercury, and no change in the reaction rate or product
yields was observed. Furthermore, the accumulation of the products
in the initial period followed a nearly linear time dependence and
no induction period in the system was evident. These observations
clearly indicated that no formation of platinum nanoparticles occurs
during the reaction; catalytic system operates under typically homogeneous
conditions, and the mechanistic cycle should involve molecular compounds.
Several platinum and gold systems were reported to operate through
the formation of catalytically competent ligand-free metal clusters.17

In our case, some of the plausible intermediates
of the catalytic
cycle were detected using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) with catalyst 17 and phenylacetylene/propyl
silane as substrates (Figures 1 and S1). Intermediates A and B
(m/z: 673.14 and 685.14) represent
a product of an oxidative addition of the H–Si bond of the
hydrosilane to the catalyst core. The composition of these intermediates
suggests that the bidentate carbene ligand remains attached to the
metal, whereas the isocyanide and chloride are lost presumably upon
the catalyst activation step. Intermediate C (m/z: 751.22) represents a product of the 1,2-alkyne insertion
into the Pt–H bond of the catalyst core already containing
the silyl fragment immediately before the reductive elimination step
to afford the target vinyl silane product.

of the catalytic cycle detected.

Although the exact mechanism of the catalytic action of platinum–ADCs
remains unclear and requires further elucidation, our initial observations
are consistent with other catalytic applications of metal–ADC
species reported previously.1b,5h,18

Final Remarks
Results of this study can be considered
from both synthetic and catalytic perspectives. From the synthetic point of view, we prepared a series of 12 platinum complexes, containing
aminocarbene ligands, namely, [PtCl{C(N=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONb))=N(H)R1}(CNR1)]a−b via
the reaction of cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] with 3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones. All new complexes were
characterized by elemental analyses (C, H, N), ESI+-MS,
FT-IR, and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy.
From the catalytic perspective, we evaluated the properties of platinum–aminocarbenes
prepared as catalysts for hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes with
hydrosilanes. The highest catalytic efficiency was achieved with complex
[PtCl{C(N=Ca(C6H3(5-Me)CONb))=N(H)(2-Cl-6-MeC6H3)}{CN(2-Cl-6-MeC6H3)}]a−b (18) that is derived
from platinum-mediated coupling of aromatic isocyanide CN(2-Cl-6-MeC6H3) with HN=Ca(C6R2R3R4R5CONbH) (R3 = Me, R2, R4, R5 = H 6). The designed
catalytic system operates at 80–100 °C for 4–6
h in toluene with a typical catalyst loading of 0.1 mol % and allows
the transformation of a variety of hydrosilanes (Et3SiH,
Pr3SiH, i-Pr3SiH, and PhMe2SiH) and terminal alkynes (PhC≡CH, t-BuC≡CH, and 4-(t-Bu)C6H4C≡CH) into the respective vinyl silanes in yields of up to
96%. Lowering the catalyst loading to 0.01 mol % increased the TON
to 8.4 × 103. Hydrosilylation of internal alkynes
PhC≡CPh, Me(CH2)2C≡C(CH2)2Me, and PhC≡CMe with hydrosilanes Et3SiH and PhMe2SiH gave corresponding trisubstituted silylated
alkenes in 86–94% yields. The results of the mercury drop test,
absence of an induction period, and the linear initial kinetics are
supportive of a molecular catalytic cycle that operates under homogeneous
conditions. It is notable that although amino(imino)carbene catalysts from this study are just slightly less active
than amino(hydrazido)carbenes reported previously,5h one of the major advantages of the former species
is their substantial thermal stability. It enables the catalytic applications
at temperatures up to 150 °C and nearly indefinite storage at
RT. It was recently shown that platinum and iridium complexes with
parent isocyanides exhibit outstanding and unexpected catalytic properties
in the cross-linking of silicone rubbers at high temperature.19 Although use of platinum–ADCs for this
tremendously important industrial process is not yet revealed, our
current catalysts might serve as logical candidates for this application.
Future studies aiming at expanding the field of catalytically relevant
metal–ADCs and at understanding the mechanism of their catalytic
action are currently underway in our group.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instrumentation
Solvents, K2[PtCl4], and all isocyanides were obtained from commercial
sources and used as received, apart from chloroform that was purified
by conventional distillation over calcium chloride. The starting cis-[PtCl2(CNR1)2] (R1 = Cy 1, t-Bu 2, Xyl 3, 2-Cl-6-MeC6H34) complexes,20 substituted and unsubstituted
3-iminoisoindolin-1-ones,21 and aminocarbene
complexes 8–165a were prepared as previously reported. C, H, and N elemental
analyses were carried out by Microanalytical Service of the Instituto
Superior Técnico. ESI+ mass spectra were recorded
on Thermo Scientific LCQ Fleet and QqTOF Impact II mass spectrometers
in MeOH. Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm–1)
were measured on a Bruker Vertex-70 instrument in KBr pellets. One-dimensional
(1H, 13C{1H}) and two-dimensional
(1H,1H COSY, 1H,13C HMQC/1H,13C HSQC, and 1H,13C HMBC)
NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance II+ 300, 400, and 500 MHz
(UltraShield Plus Magnet) spectrometers at ambient temperature using
solvent resonances as a reference.

Synthetic Work
Coupling
of cis-[PtCl2(C≡NR1)2] (R1 = Cy, t-Bu,
Xyl, 2-Cl-6-MeC6H3) with 3-Iminoisoindolin-1-one
The corresponding solid 3-iminoisoindolin-1-one (5–7) (0.20 mmol) was added to a solution of cis-[PtCl2(C≡NR1)2] (0.20 mmol) in 10 mL of CHCl3. The reaction mixture
was subsequently refluxed for ca. 8 h; during the reaction course
the color of the mixture changed from yellow to bright yellow-orange.
After cooling down, the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness
at RT under a stream of dinitrogen and the solid residue was extracted
with two 5 mL portions of CHCl3. The bright yellow solution
formed was filtered off to remove some insoluble material. The filtrate
was evaporated to dryness under a stream of dinitrogen at RT to give
a yellow precipitate, which was washed with five 5 mL portions of i-Pr2O, one 1 mL portion of cold (5 °C)
Et2O, and again with five 5 mL portions of i-Pr2O and dried in vacuo at RT. Yields of 8–19 were 65–75%. The authenticity of known
species 8–16 was established upon
comparison of their FT-IR and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra with those previously reported.5a

General Procedure for Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Alkenes with
Hydrosilanes (Specific Conditions are Provided in Tables 1–5)
Alkyne (5.0 × 10–4 mol), silane
(5.0 × 10–4 mol), selected catalysts 8–19 (5.0 × 10–7 mol), toluene (1 mL), and a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-coated magnetic
bar were placed in a 5 mL vial. The vial was closed with a septum,
sealed with an aluminum crimp seal with an open top, and vented using
a needle through several cycles of vacuum/dinitrogen flow. The vial
was kept at 60–100 °C for 2–12 h (see Tables 1–5 for details) and cooled down to RT, and the reaction
mixture was evaporated to dryness under a stream of dinitrogen. The
contents of the vial were extracted with three 0.20 mL portions of
CDCl3; all fractions were combined, followed by the addition
of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1 equiv, used as an NMR internal standard),
and then analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The isomeric
content was determined on the basis of the alkene coupling constants
in the 1H NMR spectra (e.g., for the model reaction of
phenylacetylene and triethylsilane leading to a mixture of triethyl(1-phenylvinyl)silane
(α product, J2HH = ca.
3 Hz) and (E)-triethyl(styryl)silane (β-(E) isomer, J3HH =
ca. 19 Hz))9a,15a,22 or the analysis and matching of chemical shifts for products against
authentic samples. Quantifications were performed upon integration
of the selected peaks of the product against peaks of 1,2-dimethoxyethane.
