Pentacene
films vacuum-sublimed on a cross-linked polymeric insulator
(CPVP–C6) prepared using poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP)
and 1,6-bis(trichlorosilyl)hexane (C6) were studied with
a special concern on possible influences of the CPVP–C6 thickness on the electrical characteristics of the pentacene
films. It was found that the conductivities of the pentacene films
on a thin CPVP–C6 film (10 nm) were approximately
2 orders of magnitude higher than those on a glass substrate and increased
slightly with the increase in the thickness of the underlying CPVP–C6 film. In addition, the X-ray diffraction measurements showed
that the stacking structure of pentacene molecules was remarkably
enhanced by increasing the thickness of the CPVP–C6 film, suggesting that the increase in conductivity is due, at least
in part, to the improvement in carrier mobilities caused by the growth
of large pentacene grains. An attempt to directly evaluate carrier
mobilities using pentacene/CPVP–C6 field-effect
transistors was made, and a seeming increase in the carrier mobilities
observed with the increase in the CPVP–C6 thickness
was ascribed to a hygroscopic nature of the CPVP–C6 film, which was evidenced by the capacitance and quartz crystal
microbalance measurements. Possible reasons are discussed to explain
the enhanced conductivities of the pentacene films on the increased
thicknesses of CPVP–C6.

Introduction
Organic semiconductors
have attracted an increasing interest as
active components in electronic and optoelectronic devices such as
organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes,
and organic solar cells because of their low-cost, easy fabrication,
light-weight, and possible integrations. Among their applications
to (opto)electronic devices, a recent progress of the OFETs has been
remarkable.1−11 Hole mobilities of OFETs developed so far are already comparable
to or exceed those of amorphous Si transistors used commonly in liquid
crystal displays, showing that they are eligible for coming into
the market as long as the switching rate is concerned. Before practical
applications, however, there are still several points to overcome.
One of these is a low-bias operation for a facile interfacing with
conventional electronic devices such as complementary metal-oxide
semiconductors and transistor–transistor logic. Use of thin
polymeric insulators with low leakage currents, high capacitances,
and high stability
is one of the possible solutions. Several studies have been carried
out to find polymeric insulators matching these conditions. Typical
polymeric insulators studied so far include polymethyl methacrylate,12,13 parylene,14,15 poly(methyl silsesquioxane),16,17 and fluorine-containing terpolymer.18 More recently, several kinds of cross-linked polymer blends have
been proposed and examined as a gate insulator material for OFETs
to realize low-voltage OFETs.19−22 Among them, a cross-linked polymeric insulator (CPVP–C6) composed of poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) and 1,6-bis(trichlorosilyl)hexane
(C6) (Figure 1) had the most superior gate characteristics such as large capacitance,
low leakage currents, and smooth morphology. Hydroxyl (−OH)
groups in PVP react with the trichlorosilane of C6 to give
the cross-linked structure through the formation of C–O–Si
bonds. The CPVP–C6 film can be prepared using the
spin-coating technique and is found to give low-voltage-operated OFETs.

Figure 1 Chemical
structures of poly(4-vinylphenol), 1,6-bis(trichlorosilyl)hexane,
and pentacene.

In the present study,
electrical conductivities of the pentacene
(Figure 1) films evaporated
on the CPVP–C6 films as well as those of the CPVP–C6 films alone are investigated by paying special attention
to possible influences on the film thickness of CPVP–C6. Conductivities of the pentacene films on the CPVP–C6 films are found to increase with the increase in the thickness
of the underlying CPVP–C6 film. The conductivity
increase is likely to be ascribed to the increase in carrier mobilities
as suggested by the enhanced stacking structure of the pentacene film
observed with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. In addition,
actually, mobilities evaluated with the FETs based on pentacene/CPVP–C6 were increased greatly with the increase in the thickness
of CPVP–C6. However, the anomalous increase in mobilities
was ascribed to a hygroscopic nature of the CPVP–C6 film,23−26 whose mechanism was not well-clear. Plausible reasons are discussed
to account for the conductivity changes in the pentacene films evaporated
on the polymeric insulator, together with detailed examinations of
the hygroscopic nature of the CPVP–C6 film based
on the capacitance and quartz crystal microbalance measurements.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 2 illustrates
phase-contrast images of the CPVP–C6 films ranging
in thickness from 10 to 200 nm, along with 3D images of the CPVP–C6 films obtained using the laser microscope. No obvious structure
is seen in the phase-contrast image shown in Figure 2a for the 10 nm film of CPVP–C6. However, as the thickness is increased from 25 to 200 nm
(Figure 2b–d),
a knobby structure starts to appear and the average size of the humps
increases from 10 to 50 μm. The 3D image of Figure 2a′ for the CPVP–C6 film (10 nm) shows that the surface is relatively smooth
with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra)
of 9 nm. On the other hand, the 200 nm insulating film has a pitted
uneven surface (Ra = 82 nm) as shown in Figure 2d′. Such a
pitted structure of the CPVP–C6 films is likely
to be caused by a shrinking of the polymer due to a cross-linking
reaction between PVP and C6 as illustrated in Figure 2
of ref (21).

Figure 2 Microscope
images of the spun films of CPVP–C6 whose thicknesses
are (a) 10, (b) 25, (c) 80, and (d) 200 nm. 3D
laser microscope images are also shown for the CPVP–C6 films with thicknesses of (a′) 10 and (d′) 200 nm.

Conductivities of the CPVP–C6 films measured
in an ambient atmosphere by using the four-probe method are plotted
in Figure 3 against
the thickness of the CPVP–C6 film. As a matter of
fact, conductivities of the CPVP–C6 films are almost
constant (approximately 5 × 10–8 S cm–1), independent of the thickness of the CPVP–C6 film
ranging from 10 to 200 nm. The conductivity of a pentacene film (60
nm) evaporated on a slide glass was similarly low (6 × 10–7 S cm–1). Interestingly, however,
it increased to 10–4 S cm–1 when
the pentacene film was placed on a 10 nm thick CPVP–C6 film. As the CPVP–C6 film thickness was increased
further, the conductivity of the pentacene film increased gradually
and reached 10–3 S cm–1 at the
CPVP–C6 thickness of 200 nm. The change in the conductivity
of the 60 nm pentacene film with the thickness of the polymer film
is anomalous. In general, the conductivity is proportional to a product
of the mobility of charge carriers and their density in the film,
implying that the change observed in the conductivity is ascribable
to the increase in mobility and/or carrier density. The enhancement
of a molecular stacking may facilitate hopping of charge carriers
(holes) between adjacent pentacene molecules and thus can lead to
the increase in mobility. From this viewpoint, XRD measurements were
taken for the pentacene films (60 nm) evaporated on the CPVP–C6 films (10–200 nm). As is clearly seen in Figure 4, sharp diffraction
peaks are observed in the XRD spectra. The diffraction peaks of the
pentacene films were fitted to a series of (00l)
lines (l = 1–3), with a spacing of 15.2 Å,
suggesting that the long axis of pentacene molecules was perpendicularly
aligned to the surface. A salient feature to be noted in Figure 4 is the evolution
of the diffraction peaks with the increase in the CPVP–C6 thickness. This clearly
indicates that the crystallinity of the pentacene films is enhanced
by evaporating them on thicker polymer films, and thus the enhanced
crystallinity can be responsible for the increase in the mobility
of holes in the pentacene films and in turn for the increase in the
conductivity as shown in Figure 3. It is known that the crystallization of a pentacene
film is affected greatly by the surface energy of the substrate material
deduced from the measurement of a water contact angle and the hydrophobic
surface leads to a well-crystallized pentacene film. When the water
contact angles of the CPVP–C6 films were measured,
they were 58°, 63°, 68°, and 74° for the CPVP–C6 film thicknesses of 25, 80, 200, and 650 nm, respectively,
consistent with the results of the XRD experiments. The results of
the contact angle measurements are given in Figures S1 and S2.

200 nm. Each spectrum
is shifted upward for clarity.

It is of interest to directly measure the mobilities of charge
carriers (holes) in the pentacene films using the FET configuration. Figure 5a depicts the output
characteristics of a pentacene–FET with a 20 nm-thick CPVP–C6 film as an insulator. The curves of drain current (ID) versus drain voltage (VD) show that the pentacene–FET can be operated by the
gate voltages below 2 V, as has been reported by Marks et al.21 The capacitance for the 20 nm-thick CPVP–C6 film measured at 1 to 104 Hz was around 240 nF
cm–2, and the large capacitance value could be responsible
for the low operation voltage. The mobility value obtained from the
plot shown in Figure 5b with the capacitance of 240 nF cm–2 was 0.06
cm2 V–1 s–1, which
is in good agreement with the one reported by Marks et al. The pentacene–FETs
were fabricated with increased thicknesses of the CPVP–C6 insulators, and their mobilities were measured in a similar
manner. The result is shown in Figure 6. It is seen that the mobility of FETs is increased
drastically as the insulator thickness increases, and it reaches an
unusually large value of 102 cm2 V–1 s–1 when the film thickness of CPVP–C6 is 600 nm. Obviously, this mobility of 102 cm2 V–1 s–1 is anomalously
high for those of pentacene–FETs reported so far. In addition,
the change in the mobility from 0.06 to 25 cm2 V–1 s–1 corresponding to the CPVP–C6 film thickness of 20 and 200 nm is obviously large when compared
with the change in conductivity (10–4 to 10–3 S cm–1) as shown in Figure 3.

Österbacka et al. have reported OFETs composed of
regioregular
poly(3-hexylthiophene) as organic semiconductors and PVP as insulators.
Their OFETs were characterized by a low-voltage operation and apparently
high mobilities and were named “hygroscopic insulator field-effect
transistors” (HIFETs) because the inclusion of water in the
insulating PVP layer was essential for the FET operation.23−26 A simple diagnosis of the HIFET is to compare the FET operations
in moist air and in vacuum. Indeed, the pentacene–FET with
CPVP–C6 as the insulator was sensitive to atmosphere,
and the FET characteristics almost disappeared a couple of minutes
after evacuation of the device. Also, ON and OFF currents of the pentacene–FET
with CPVP–C6 were in the ranges of 10–8 to 10–6 and 10–9 to 10–8 A, respectively, and the ON/OFF ratio was around 101 to
102, which is much lower than those of general OFETs (103 to 105). These results demonstrate the HIFET nature
of our pentacene–FETs. The operating principle of HIFETs has
been discussed and explained in terms of the formation of hydronium
ions because of the interaction between the −OH group of PVP
and a water molecule and the migration of the ionic species in the
insulator PVP film, leading to a high capacitance of the polymer due
to the ionic polarization. In the relatively thick CPVP–C6 films used in this study, the −OH groups of PVP may
not react completely with the chlorosilanes of C6, and
the remaining −OH groups may interact with water.

To
further clarify the hygroscopic nature of the CPVP–C6 films, capacitances of the CPVP–C6 films
were measured in air and under vacuum with oscillation frequency as
a parameter. The results are shown in Figure 7. The capacitances of the 10 nm-thick CPVP–C6 film in air are almost constant at 400 nF cm–2 over a frequency range beyond 1 Hz, whereas it increases as the
frequency is decreased below 1 Hz. No appreciable change in the capacitance
was observed by evacuation for the thin CPVP–C6 film.
For the 200 nm-thick CPVP–C6 film, on the other
hand, the capacitance measured in air changed greatly from 35 nF cm–2 at 103 Hz to 2 × 104 nF
cm–2 at 0.1 Hz (a 3 orders-of-magnitude increase).
In contrast to the case of the 10 nm-thick CPVP–C6 film, evacuation of the OFET device led to the decrease in capacitance,
especially at low frequencies. The observed frequency dependence of
capacitances is reasonably explained by the slow migration of hydronium
ions in the CPVP–C6 films.23−26 Furthermore, the capacitances
of thick CPVP–C6 films in the low-frequency region
are decreased markedly by removing water from the insulators by evacuation.
This is also consistent with the hygroscopic property of the CPVP–C6 films. The change in the amount of water in the CPVP–C6 film before and after evacuation was measured using a quartz-crystal
microbalance technique. The change in frequency with time during evacuation
was extremely slow; therefore, precise evaluation of the water content
absorbed in the CPVP–C6 films was difficult. In Figure 8, the amount of water
evaluated from the frequency change measured 1 h after the start of
evacuation is plotted against the thickness of the CPVP–C6 film. The plot shows that the water content increases with
the increase in the thickness of the CPVP–C6 film,
suggesting that water was absorbed not only on the insulator surface
but also in the polymer bulk.

Experimental Section
Pentacene, PVP (Mw = 20 000),
and 1,6-bis(trichlorosilyl)hexane (C6) were
purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Pentacene–FETs
were fabricated as described below. An Al film (10 nm in thickness)
was evaporated onto a precleaned slide glass. CPVP–C6 was prepared on the Al-coated slide glass by the spin-coating of
a tetrahydrofuran solution containing the same concentrations of PVP
and C6 at 3000 rpm and was annealed in vacuum at 110 °C
for 50 min. The film thicknesses of CPVP–C6 were
controlled by changing the concentration of PVP and C6.
Optical and 3D microscopy images of the polymer films were obtained
by using a phase-contrast microscope (Olympus BX51) and a 3D color
laser microscope (Keyence VK-9700/9710 Generation II), respectively.
Pentacene films of thickness 60 nm were evaporated on the polymer
films, and subsequently, an Au layer of 20 nm was deposited on the
pentacene films. The channel length and total channel width were 50
μm and 3 mm, respectively. The ID versus VD characteristics of the pentacene–FETs
were measured using Keithley 2400 source meters. Mobilities were evaluated
from the following equation 1  where IDS is the
drain current in the saturation regime, W and L are the channel width and channel length, respectively,
μ is the mobility, C is the capacitance of
the insulator, VG is the gate voltage,
and VT denotes the threshold voltage at
which the transistor turns on. Capacitance measurements of the CPVP–C6 films with varying thicknesses were performed using an LCR
meter (HIOKI 3522-50). Conductivities of the CPVP–C6 films and the pentacene films evaporated on the CPVP–C6 films were determined using the four-probe method using a
resistivity meter (Loresta-GP MCP-T610, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.).
Configurations of devices used for the measurements of FET and conductivities
are shown in detail in Figure S3. The film
thicknesses of CPVP–C6 were evaluated from the capacitance
values with a dielectric constant of 6.1, and they were confirmed
using 3D color laser microscopy. A change in the weight of the CPVP–C6 film upon evacuation was measured using a quartz-crystal
monitor (ULVAC). XRD measurements were performed using a D8 Advance
diffractometer (Bruker AXS) using Cu Kα radiation. All measurements
were taken in an ambient atmosphere, unless otherwise stated.

Conclusions
CPVP–C6 and the pentacene films on CPVP–C6 were characterized through electrical, XRD, microscopic,
water contact angle, and quartz-crystal microbalance measurements.
One of the key findings in the present study is the conductivities
of the pentacene films on the CPVP–C6 films that
increased with the increase in the thickness of CPVP–C6. The increase in conductivity can be ascribed to the increase
in either or both of the carrier mobility and the density of charge
carriers because mobility is a product of the carrier mobility and
the density of charge carriers in the single charge carrier model.
To discuss the possible reasons for the increase in the conductivity,
the mobilities of charge carriers using the FET configuration of pentacene/CPVP–C6 were measured. The FET mobilities obtained using the polymeric
insulator CPVP–C6 seemingly increased with the increase
in the thickness of CPVP–C6, but the increased mobilities
on thicker CPVP–C6 films were ascribed to a hygroscopic
nature of the CPVP–C6 film. Nevertheless, we presume
that the conductivity increase in the pentacene films is ascribable
to the increase in the mobilities of holes in the pentacene films
as supported by the XRD measurements, which shows that the stacking
structure of pentacene molecules is enhanced by increasing the thickness
of the CPVP–C6 film. The mobility increase due to
the enhanced crystallinity may be insufficient for explaining the
increase in conductivity as shown in Figure 3; therefore, we assume an increase in the
density of charge carriers as well. Charge carriers (holes) may be
generated in the pentacene films upon contact with the CPVP–C6 film, if the work function of the latter film is larger than
that of the former to build an accumulated region in the p-type pentacene
films.
