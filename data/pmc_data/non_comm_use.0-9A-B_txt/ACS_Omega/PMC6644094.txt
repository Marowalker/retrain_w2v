Helical molecules such as DNA have
recently been found to behave
as an efficient source and detector of spin-polarized charge carriers.
This phenomenon, often dubbed as chirality-induced spin selectivity
or CISS, could be used to significantly improve the performance of
spintronic devices, which utilize carrier spins (rather than charge)
to realize electronic and sensing functions. Recently, it has been
reported that carbon nanotubes, helically wrapped with DNA, can also
act as an efficient source and detector of spin-polarized carriers,
by virtue of spin–orbit coupling originating from the helical
potential. It has been postulated that spin polarization should increase
with the length of the wrapped tubes. However, in literature, most
fabrication processes yield tubes with submicron lengths, which can
produce ∼70% spin polarization. In an effort to enhance this
effect further, here, we report a fabrication process that can yield
DNA-wrapped nanotubes of length ∼1–4 microns. Detailed
characterization of these devices, using atomic force microscopy,
Raman, UV–vis, and temperature-dependent transport, has been
presented. Initial transport measurements indicate the presence of
strong magnetoresistance in these tubes, which could be attributed
to spin-dependent effects. Systematic fabrication of long DNA-wrapped
nanotubes, which has hitherto not been reported, is expected to enable
further investigation into the spin-dependent properties of these
ultimate one-dimensional nanoscale hybrids and may have a significant
impact on nanoscale spintronics.

1 Introduction
Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), rolled up cylindrical forms of two-dimensional
hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms (or graphene),1 have been explored extensively over the last few decades.
The carbon atoms in CNTs are sp2 hybridized, with strong
carbon–carbon σ bonds and available pz orbitals. Such a chemical structure leads to excellent mechanical,2,3 thermal,4 electronic,5 and sensing6,7 properties, some of which are
already finding commercial applications.8 At present, significant effort is being spent on realizing future
computing technologies using CNTs, via conventional charge-based electronics9,10 or emerging spin-based electronics (or spintronics).11

One of the major disadvantages of CNTs,
however, has been their
poor solubility in common aqueous and organic solvents. As-grown nanotubes
often take bundled form because of inter-tube van der Waal’s
interaction, and for device applications it is important to have them
dispersed. To address this, various types of chemical functionalization
techniques have been developed.12,13 Functionalization can
be performed primarily in two different ways, such as (a) covalent
functionalization,12 which while being
chemically stable, adversely affects the intrinsic properties (such
as electrical conductivity, toughness, etc.) of the nanotubes by inflicting
irreversible structural damage and (b) noncovalent functionalization,13 which keeps the inherent properties of the nanotubes
intact but are comparatively less stable. Chemical functionalizations
not only disperse the nanotubes but they often allow separation of
tubes based on their electronic properties (semiconducting vs metallic)12,13 and also form the basis of a wide variety of electrochemical sensors,14 by virtue of the attached chemical moieties.

For the purpose of device electronics, noncovalent functionalization
is more desirable because it minimally affects the intrinsic electronic
properties of the tubes. One simple and efficient approach is functionalization
using single-stranded DNA, which has been investigated extensively
in the past.15−17 The DNA–CNT binding energy is higher than
the CNT–CNT binding energy, which facilitates tube separation.15 The DNA–CNT interaction is mediated by
(a) π-stacking interaction between the DNA bases and the
pz orbitals of the nanotube carbon atoms
and (b) electrostatic interaction between nanotube and sugar-phosphate
backbone.15 The DNA strands, due to their
intrinsic helicity, tend to wrap the nanotubes in a helical fashion.18 Such helically wrapped nanotubes have been used
for diverse applications in recent years.19

Very recently, such helically wrapped nanotubes have found
a novel
application in the area of spintronics.20−23 By definition, spintronics is
the subfield of electronics where the goal is to use the spin degree
of freedom of charge carriers to realize various sensing and computing
devices.24 Commonly, ferromagnetic contacts
(such as Ni, Co, Fe, and their alloys) are used to generate and detect
spin-polarized carriers and are often referred to as “spin
filters”.25 Recently, it has been
discovered that chiral molecules such as DNA can also perform as a
spin filter and often with better efficiency than the transition-metal
ferromagnets mentioned above.26 This phenomenon
is commonly referred to as the “chirality-induced spin selectivity”
or CISS effect.26 Recent theories and experiments
have shown that CNTs, helically wrapped with single-stranded DNA,
can also play the same role.20−23 This opens up a completely new application area for
DNA–CNT functionalization chemistry, which has been well developed
over the past decade.

In case of the CISS effect, charge carriers
become spin-polarized
via the spin–orbit interaction induced by the helical potential.26 It has been found that spin polarization increases
with increasing base-pair length,27 presumably
because the carriers experience prolonged interaction during their
transit through longer chiral systems. By the same token, longer nanotubes,
helically wrapped with DNA is expected to produce higher degree of
spin polarization. Recent experiments performed on ∼750 nm
long tubes resulted in ∼70–80% spin polarization.20,21 Because overall efficiency of spintronic devices depends critically
on spin-filtering efficiency,28 ideally
∼100% spin polarization is desirable, which could be obtained
from longer nanotubes with helical functionalizations. However, most
earlier studies on CNT–DNA functionalizations (reviewed below)
resulted in short tubes (typically less than 1 μm) because of
fabrication constraints. Motivated by this, here, we report fabrication
of isolated and long (∼1–4 μm) nanotubes, helically
wrapped with DNA strands. The fabrication process is applicable for
both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. Functionalized nanotubes
have been characterized in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM),
optical absorption experiments, Raman spectroscopy and temperature-dependent
electrical transport. Preliminary magnetotransport data has also been
presented, which suggests the presence of spin filtering. A detailed
study of spin polarization as a function of length is however beyond
the scope of this paper and will be reported in a future work.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly
review prior work on nanotubes functionalized by DNA, with focus on
final tube length. In Section 3, we describe the fabrication process. Results and discussions
are presented in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with a brief summary and potential implications of
this work.

2 Prior Work
Nanotube dispersion can
be achieved via functionalizing CNTs by
a wide range of polymers.12,13,29 Here, however, we will focus on single-stranded DNA because in most
cases they wrap the tubes helically15,16,30,31 and the composite hybrid
has been found to be a promising spin filter system.20,21 Typically, nanotube powder is mixed with excess DNA solution. Next,
ultrasonication is used to disintegrate the nanotube bundle, which
allows the DNA strands to wrap with the tubes. This step also determines
the length of the dispersed (and helically wrapped) nanotubes,32 which is a critical aspect for spin filter applications
as described above. Finally, the mixture is centrifuged, which results
in precipitation of unfunctionalized tubes and other impurities. Helically
wrapped nanotubes are dispersed in the supernatant solution, which
is decanted for further processing.

Reference (15) reported
CNT wrapping by various lengths (60-, 30-, 21-, and 15-mer) of poly-T
strands, among which T30 produced the highest yield. Typical
nanotube length, based on AFM, is ∼50–1000 nm. Reference (16) used d(GT)n (n = 10–45) to isolate SW-CNTs,
and length distribution of ∼50–500 nm was observed.
In particular, d(GT)30 resulted in an average tube length
of ∼500 nm.33 Reference (34) used long genomic ssDNA
(∼3796 bases) with random sequence to disperse CNTs. The average
length was found to be ∼700 nm, and in a few instances, 2 μm
long nanotubes were observed. Longer tube length was attributed to
longer DNA strands and short sonication time (∼10–20
min). However, because of the short sonication period, few nanotube
bundles remained in the solution (not well dispersed), which is consistent
with other studies.32 Natural DNA has been
used by several other groups as well.35−37 Reference (37) used ∼10 000
base-pair long DNA, which is expected to shorten after sonication.
The reported average final nanotube length was ∼260 nm.37 References (38) and (39) studied the effect of DNA sequence length on helical wrapping
and separation of nanotubes. Short DNA strands, such as d(GT)3 and d(AC)3, were found to disperse CNTs more efficiently
than the longer ones (d(GT)n and d(AC)n, n = 4, 10, 20, 40). Reference (40) was able to disperse nanotubes
by double-stranded DNA. Typical DNA length was ∼100–300
base pairs, and from the AFM data, average nanotube length was around
few 100 nm. Reference (41) reported loosening of DNA wrapping as strand length is increased.

3 Fabrication
The key aspects that determine the length
of the final wrapped
nanotubes are (i) length of DNA strand because it is expected that
long base-pair DNA will wrap longer tube segments and lead to longer
wrapped nanotubes and (ii) ultrasonication parameters such as power
and duration.16 In this work, we focus
on d(GT)n strands because they are known
to produce efficient functionalization as well as exhibit spin filtering.
We report data on d(GT)200, which systematically produces
nanotubes with length ∼1–4 μm, significantly longer
than those reported in the current literature (<1 μm). We
varied the ultrasonication duration to maximize the length of the
wrapped tubes. We compared our results with shorter d(GT)15 strands and found that longer strands consistently produce efficient
dispersion, without sacrificing the length of the tube.

For
fabrication of DNA-wrapped long nanotubes, we use d(GT)200 strands (Integrated DNA Technologies). First, 20 nmol of
DNA oligo is mixed with nuclease-free water and buffer to produce
1 mg/mL ssDNA solution. Next, 0.7 mg of HiPco SW (single-wall)-CNTs
(diameter ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 nm, NanoIntegris Inc.) is mixed
with this solution, and the mixture was ultrasonicated (Sonics, VC130
PB) for 90 min at a power level of 7 W in an ice-water bath. After
sonication, the mixture is centrifuged at 14 000g for 60 min, which precipitates undispersed SW-CNTs at the bottom.
The top part of the mixture was collected for further experiments.

A small part of the decanted supernatant solution is drop cast
on top of SiO2 substrate for a few minutes, followed by
thorough rinsing with deionized (DI) water and drying under ambient
conditions. These specimens are used for AFM (Dimension Edge) studies.
AFM observations described below suggest that most of the bundled
CNTs are converted into individual wrapped tubes. The minimum length
of ssDNA–CNTs at this stage is 1 μm and some are as long
as 4 μm. For electrical transport measurements, a small amount
of ssDNA–CNT supernatant solution was drop cast on prepatterned
Au and Ni contacts for 15 min. Next, the substrates are thoroughly
rinsed with DI water and vacuum annealed (200 °C for 30 min).
Vacuum annealing improves the electrical contacts between the electrodes
and ssDNA–CNTs and improves the reproducibility of charge transport
measurements. Contact thickness is ∼100 nm (Figure S6, Supporting Information), and they were photolithographically
patterned on top of SiO2 (500 nm)/Si wafer.

4 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
d(GT)200 wrapped nanotubes dispersed on SiO2 substrate. Figure 1b–d shows representative images of tubes with length ∼1–4
μm. For the purpose of comparison, Figure 1e shows wrapping using d(GT)15 under the same fabrication condition as above. In this case, however,
tubes are <1 μm, which is consistent with previously published
data cited above. Additional AFM image corresponding to this case
is shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information). Clearly, length of the strands plays a role in determining the
final length of the wrapped tubes. To check if reducing the sonication
time using d(GT)15 strands helps in preserving tube length,
we carried out the process for 60 min. As seen from Figure 1f, tube lengths are slightly
longer (∼2 μm), but the tubes are not well dispersed
and stay in the bundled form (indicated by arrows). Additional AFM
image corresponding to this case is shown in Figure S1b (Supporting Information). Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows nanotube length
distribution collected from ∼50 nanotubes. Clear difference
in the average tube length is observed, with d(GT)200 resulting
in more than double the average length of d(GT)15 functionalized
tubes for identical sonication time (90 min). Figure 1g,h shows AFM height scan along the tube
length for d(GT)200 and d(GT)15, respectively.
Periodic height modulation is observed, which indicates the presence
of helical wrapping along the tube length. Wrapping pitch is ∼26
nm in both cases, which is not surprising because both strands have
identical chemical composition. The exact value of the wrapping pitch
could be smaller than the above value due to convolution with the
AFM tip.

Figure 1 (a–f) AFM images of dispersed nanotubes wrapped with d(GT)200 and d(GT)15. Ultrasonication times are indicated
in each image. (g,h) Both strands result in similar wrapping pitch.

For optical absorption measurements,
a drop of ssDNA–CNT
[or, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–CNT] supernatant solution
was cast on a quartz substrate and naturally dried. We used PerkinElmer
Lambda 1050 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer over a range
of 400 to 1400 nm with spectral resolution of 1 nm. SDS functionalization
was used for the sake of comparison because unlike DNA, SDS does not
wrap the tubes helically. For SDS functionalization, 1 mL of SDS (1%
w/v) was mixed with 0.8 mg of SW-CNTs, followed by 90 min of ultrasonication
and 60 min of centrifugation. Figure 2 shows the typical absorption spectra. Semiconducting
HiPco tubes exhibit S11 (900–1600 nm) and S22 (550–900 nm) interband transitions, and metallic
HiPco tubes show M11 interband transition (400–650
nm)16 in the measurement range. Observation
of multiple peaks in the spectrum indicates the presence of nanotubes
with different chiralities in the sample. As shown in the inset of Figure 2, the peaks are narrower
for d(GT)15 and d(GT)200, compared with SDS,
indicating more efficient dispersion by the DNA strands. Compared
with SDS functionalized tubes, DNA functionalization causes a blue
shift (∼25 nm, Figure 2 inset) in the absorption peaks. Statistical data showing
multiple (∼3) scans, their average, and standard deviation
are presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), which confirms the above features. Further information about the
dispersed nanotubes can be extracted from Raman spectroscopy as described
below.

Figure 2 Ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–near
IR) absorption spectra of nanotubes dispersed by various reagents.
Multiple peaks indicate presence of nanotubes with different chiralities
in the specimen. As shown in the inset, DNA wrapping causes narrowing
and blue shift of an absorption peak compared to SDS-wrapped tubes.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful
tool for characterization of single-wall
CNTs.42Figure 3 shows representative Raman spectra (532
nm excitation, room temperature) before and after nanotube wrapping
(dry condition, no annealing). These spectra exhibit two main features:
(a) radial breathing mode (RBM) at lower wavenumbers and (b) tangential
mode (TM) or G mode at higher wavenumbers. Figure 3a shows the RBM band, which occurs at lower
wavenumbers and corresponds to the coherent radial vibrations of the
carbon atoms.42 The vibration frequency
is inversely related to the tube diameter dt.42 As seen from the RBM spectrum of the
bundled tubes (Figure S4, Supporting Information), there are multiple peaks in the 200–320 cm–1 range, which implies a diameter distribution of dt = 0.8–1.2 nm (±0.1 nm) in the bundle. The
main peak occurs around ∼267 cm–1, which
corresponds to diameter of ∼0.9 nm, matching closely with vendor
specification. This main peak is also quite broad, with full width
at half-maximum (fwhm) of ∼19.33 cm–1 (Figure
S4, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Raman characterization
of bundled nanotubes and dispersed nanotubes
using 532 nm excitation. Three different dispersing reagents have
been used: SDS, d(GT)15, and d(GT)200. (a) RBM
and (b) TM or G band. A weak defect (D) band is present
at ∼1350 cm–1. (b) Inset shows fitting of
the G band with three Lorentzians and one B–W–F lineshape.

After DNA wrapping, RBM peaks
tend to get narrower, as a result
of dispersion and nanotube isolation (Figure 3a). For example, d(GT)15 and d(GT)200 lead to fwhm (main peak) of ∼11.94 and 12.15 cm–1, respectively. DNA wrapping also leads to fewer peaks
compared with the bundle because of fewer population of nanotubes
in the sample and diameter selectivity of the wrapping process. Interestingly,
the peak positions are shifted slightly (∼4 cm–1) toward higher wavenumbers. DNA wrapping tends to constrain the
radial vibration of the carbon atoms, leading to an effective increase
in the tube stiffness in the radial direction, resulting in higher
wavenumbers. This feature confirms tight physical wrapping of nanotubes
by the DNA strands.

Comparing all of the three reagents used
for dispersion, it appears
that d(GT)15 and d(GT)200 are approximately
equally effective in terms of wrapping compactness. On the other hand,
dispersion using SDS does not appear to be as effective as the DNA
strands because the RBM band closely resembles the bundled CNT.

Figure 3b shows
the TM mode (or G band) for nanotube bundle and after functionalization
with three different reagents. The TM mode has two prominent peaks:
G+, which occurs around 1580 cm–1 and
G–, which occurs at lower wavenumbers (∼1525
cm–1). The G+ peak originates from the
longitudinal vibrations of carbon atoms along the tube axis, whereas
G– is due to the circumferential vibrations.43 The force constant of C–C bonds is larger
along the longitudinal direction compared with the tangential direction,
which explains the difference between the frequencies of these two
bands. After DNA functionalization, circumferential vibration gets
quenched because of tight wrapping with DNA strands, which results
in weaker G– peaks, as can be seen clearly from Figure 3b. Overall, as expected,
the G band gets narrower after dispersion, compared with the bundle.
For example, the G+ peak has a fwhm of 41.83 cm–1 for bundled tubes, which reduces to 17.9 cm–1 for
d(GT)200 wrapping and 22.12 cm–1 for
d(GT)15 wrapping. Wrapping with SDS reduced the fwhm to
35.34 cm–1, which is not as pronounced as the DNA
strands mentioned above. Functionalization also causes charge transfer
between the tube and DNA strands, resulting in slight upshift in the
peak locations.42 For the DNA strands,
this shift is ∼10 cm–1, whereas for SDS,
it is only ∼3 cm–1. This reconfirms tight
physical wrapping of the nanotubes by DNA strands.

Figure S5
(Supporting Information) shows
summary (average and standard deviation) of Raman data collected from
multiple (∼5) scans and multiple samples. The qualitative features
described above represent the general behavior exhibited by these
specimens.

The G+ peak can be fitted with a Lorentzian,
whereas
G– peak requires a broad Breit–Wigner–Fano
lineshape and two Lorentzians, as shown in the inset of Figure 3b. This feature is a signature
of metallic nanotubes and arises due to coupling of phonons with the
continuum of electronic states near the Fermi level of metallic nanotubes.44 Semiconducting tubes, on the other hand, do
not exhibit such a feature, and in that case, both G+ and
G– peaks can be fitted with Lorentzians.

Figure 4 shows the
two-terminal temperature-dependent I–V characteristics for d(GT)200 wrapped nanotubes.
Contact resistances of such devices have been characterized in our
prior work20 and have been found to be
negligible. This could be attributed to the annealing step described
above, and a similar effect has been reported by other groups as well.45,46 For this study, the channel length is set to ∼750 nm, as
seen in Figure 4 insets
and Figure S6 (Supporting Information).
Multiple tubes could be present in between the contacts but only very
few are electrically connected with both contacts (Figure 4, top-left inset). Diluting
the dispersed nanotube solution results in fewer tubes between the
contacts (Figure 4,
bottom-right inset). Nonlinear I–V characteristics, typical of single-wall nanotubes, have been observed.
Temperature dependence of I–V clearly shows a semiconducting trend, as observed before in similar
devices.47 This apparently contradicts
the Raman data reported above, which shows a metallic nature. However,
perturbation due to helical functionalization could lift the degeneracy
of the original subbands and create a band gap. For this measurement,
one contact is Au and other contact is Ni, which serves as a spin
detector as described below.

Figure 4 (Main image) Temperature-dependent current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics of
CNTs wrapped
with d(GT)200 at zero magnetic field. Top-left inset shows
multiple tubes between the contacts, but only very few are electrically
connected with both contacts (shown by arrows). Bottom-right inset
shows only one tube connected between the contacts.

DNA molecules are known to exhibit large-band gap
semiconducting
behavior, even at room temperature.48,49 Typically,
in the low bias range, DNA strands exhibit very low conductance and
essentially behave as an insulator.48,49 This is in
contrast with the data observed in Figure 4, which shows low but measurable conductance
in this range. This indicates that the primary transport channel is
the nanotube and not the DNA strands on the periphery. This is consistent
with the device geometry because direct one-step coherent tunneling
through 750 nm wide potential barrier (due to DNA strands) is extremely
unlikely.50 Also, in such a case, current
should be almost independent of temperature, which we do not observe.
Incoherent thermally activated hopping could provide another transport
mechanism through the DNA strands,50 but
this should be ineffective at low temperatures, and even at higher
temperatures DNA strands still behave as insulators.49 Further, in case of DNA, the conductance gap at low bias
tends to increase with temperature,48 which
is qualitatively different from what we observe. Thus, in our case,
carrier transport appears to be taking place via the nanotubes. The
role of DNA functionalization is to induce an inversion-asymmetric
helical potential on the charge carriers, which is expected to result
in a finite nonzero spin polarization via spin–orbit coupling.

Because nanotubes are the primary transport channels, the I–V scans are highly reproducible
with negligible difference between multiple scans taken under the
same condition. This is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). We note that while ssDNA–single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNT) hybrids are unstable above 80 °C in aqueous
solutions, the critical temperature for these hybrids adsorbed on
SiO2 is much higher.18 Using
a binding energy value of 0.7 eV for ssDNA–SWCNT hybrids from
this study, we can estimate the critical temperature for instability
on SiO2 substrate, which turns out to be approximately
few 1000 K. This value is significantly larger than our annealing
temperature (200 °C or 473 K), and hence, no DNA unwrapping is
expected. We have examined the nanotubes by AFM after annealing (Figure
S10, Supporting Information) and the same
helical wrapping pattern was observed, indicating that the DNA molecules
were not destroyed as a result of annealing.

Figure 5 shows I–V characteristics at 9 and 21
K for two different magnetic field values +1.2 and −1.2 T.
Magnetic field is applied in-plane and is sufficient to saturate the
magnetic Ni contact, which has a coercive field of ∼100 G.
A clear splitting in the I–V curve has been observed, which indicates the presence of a magnetoresistance
(MR) effect in these devices. The insets in Figure 5 show the resistance (R =
dV/dI) as a function of bias (V), computed by numerical differentiation of the I–V characteristics. At a given
bias, a significant split in the resistances has been observed, especially
in ±0.1 V range. The MR effect gradually disappears as the bias
is increased. Also, at higher temperatures (such as 70 K), the MR
effect is not present (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Typical I–V characteristics
at +1.2 and −1.2 T, showing the presence of MR at 9 (a) and
21 K (b). (Insets) Variation of device resistance as a function of
bias.

As indicated above, the I–V scans are highly reproducible
and the observed splitting cannot
be attributed to statistical variations. As an example, Figure S9 shows multiple scans at each magnetic
field, the average value, and the standard deviations. The magnetic
field-dependent splitting is still observed.

The magnitude of
the MR value (defined as R(1.2
T) – R(−1.2 T)/R(−1.2
T)) is significant ∼90% at 0.1 V and 9 K and cannot be explained
by AMR (anisotropic MR) of Ni contact, which is typically ∼1%.
Also, as the temperature-dependent I–Vs indicate, the series resistance of the metallic contacts
does not play any perceptible role in the overall device resistance.
Such a large MR signal is indicative of spin-dependent transmission
at the Ni contact, which acts as a spin detector. These data suggest
that d(GT)200 strands are capable of spin filtering, consistent
with existing literature. Using Julliere model and assuming 33% spin
polarization for Ni, we estimate a typical spin polarization value
of 79% at −0.1 V and 21 K. Because d(GT)200 functionalization
creates longer tubes, it is possible to perform a systematic length-dependent
study of spin polarization using these tubes. A detailed study on
length dependence of spin filtering is currently underway and is beyond
the scope of the current work.

5 Conclusion
In conclusion,
we have reported successful and reproducible fabrication
of individual long CNTs wrapped with single-stranded DNA. Previous
studies mostly reported only submicron tubes, but our choice of fabrication
parameters allows us to significantly expand (∼2–4×)
the length range of the tubes. The wrapped tubes have been characterized
extensively using various techniques, and they reveal high degree
of dispersion of nanotubes, complete DNA wrapping along nanotube length
without any evidence of discontinuity and tight physical contact between
DNA and nanotube. Such features are highly desirable for subsequent
device fabrication. In particular, long DNA-wrapped tubes are becoming
increasingly important in the emerging area of chiral spintronics,
where it has been found that longer tubes can increase the spin polarization
of charge carriers in electrical transport devices. Initial data suggest
the presence of spin filtering in these systems. Our fabrication process
enables further investigation in this area (especially, length dependence
of spin filtering) and can potentially result in highly spin-polarized
nanoscale systems, which will find applications in ultrasmall spintronic
devices and circuits.
