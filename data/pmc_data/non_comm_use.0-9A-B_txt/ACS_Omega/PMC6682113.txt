Immune
checkpoint blockades have revolutionized the treatment landscape
for several cancer indications, yet they have not gained traction
in a range of other tumors such as triple-negative breast cancer.
Despite durable disease control by many patients, a third of cancer
patients relapse due to acquired resistance. Combined immunotherapy
has shown significant promise to overcome these grand challenges.
In this report, we describe the synthesis and characterization of
dual-action small-molecule PARP1/PD-L1 inhibitor conjugates as potential
targeted anticancer agents. These conjugates display significant apoptosis
and cytotoxic efficacy to approximately 2–20-fold better than
their individual agents in a panel of cancer cell lines. This was
underscored by derived combination indices, which was consistent with
strong synergy when cells were treated with the individual agents,
olaparib and BMS-001 using the Chou–Talalay method. Furthermore,
we sought to unravel the mechanistic behavior of the conjugates and
their implications on the PARP/PD-L1 axis. We used apoptosis, cell
cycle, immunoblotting, and T-cell proliferation assays to establish
the synergy imparted by these conjugates. These multifunctional compounds
enable the discovery of small-molecule immunochemotherapeutic agents
and chemical probes to elucidate the cross-talk between DNA repair
and PD-L1 pathways.

Introduction
Immunotherapy involving
immune checkpoint modulation, adoptive
cell transfer, and cancer vaccine is the strategy du jour for cancer
treatment.1 Programmed cell death receptor
1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibition, a subset
of immune checkpoint modulation, is one of the most clinically efficient
strategies, which provide durable response rates, with accompanying
low toxicity profile.1,2 Immunotherapeutics seek to suppress
the various tumor immune evasion mechanisms, which in turn enable
host immune responses to combat tumors.3 Immune evasion, as a tumor survival strategy, includes all mechanisms
through which tumor avoids lethal adaptive immunologic responses,
enhancing survival in its milieu as well as evolving to maximize its
growth in the host.4 Implicit in these
tumor evasion mechanisms are the alteration of specific co-inhibitory
and co-stimulatory pathways,namely, immune checkpoints. The PD-1/PD-L1
axis is a co-inhibitory immune checkpoint. The engagement of the PD-1
receptor protein with its ligand triggers suppressive signals that
play a key role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and preventing
immunopathogenesis and autoimmune diseases.5,6 Tumors
can deploy the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to institute an immune evasive roadblock,
which compromises the cytotoxic abilities of activated T-cells and
the immune system in general.7,8

To overcome resistance
and improve potency associated with PD-1/PD-L1
therapy, several clinical combinations have emerged.9 One of such novel combinations strategy is PARP inhibitors
(PARPi) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.10,11 For instance,
the potency of a PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab, was improved by conjugating
it, through a PEG-linker, to doxorubicin.12 Combining the PARPi (niraparib) and the PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab)
has also shown to be synergistic and provides enhanced antitumor activities
in both BRCA-proficient and BRCA-deficient tumors.13 Equally, PARPi and anti-PD-L1 mAb in combination therapies
are also synergistic and improve antitumor responses.14−16

Few small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitors exist, and extensive research
work has been done to decode their specific modes of interaction with
the PD-L1 cell surface protein.17 Similar
structural studies have also been done for PD-L1 antibodies, with
the goal to develop potent small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitors that can
get through to the clinics.18−20 Small molecule combinations for
PARPi and PD-L1 are virtually nonexistent due to lack of clinically
approved small-molecule anti-PD-L1 agents.

PARP inhibition is
a first-line treatment regimen for tumors that
harbor BRCA1/2 mutations due to synthetic lethality. DNA damage occurs
in cells routinely and can be caused by several reasons including
genetic insults, exposure to radiation, etc. Several cell-based mechanisms
employ repair proteins to correct the damage according to type: single-
or double-stranded breaks. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are classical examples
of such repair proteins.21 These repair
double-strand DNA deformations by a process called homologous recombination
repair (HRR). Alteration in the genes that encode these repair proteins
can ultimately affect this repair process, resulting in error-laden
DNA repair, subsequently leading to cancer.22 PARP1 is a repair protein that corrects single-stranded nicks in
the DNA. If unrepaired until replication, then these single-stranded
breaks can degenerate into double-stranded breaks.23−25 PARP inhibitors
demonstrate synthetic lethality in cells with impaired homologous
recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair function, particularly BRCA1/2-associated
tumors. Thus, PARP inhibition is particularly effective against BRCA-1/2-mutated
tumors via synthetic lethality.26,27 It is asserted that
tumors with greater mutational burden are vulnerable to immune checkpoint
blockade. For example, BRCA1-mutated tumors have high lymphocyte infiltration
than non-BRCA1 tumors, resulting in improved survival and antitumor
immune response.28

Several PARPi
conjugates exist. Classical examples include the
novel conjugate of SiR fluorochromes and olaparib derivatives as probes
for cellular nuclear targeting.29 Related
radiolabeled PARPi-conjugates have found applications as radiotracers.30−32 A PARPi conjugate prodrug, which targets PARP1 and releases nitric
oxide, has also shown promise.25

Recent studies suggest the existence of a cross-talk between PARP
and PD-1/PD-L1 axis. The inhibition of PARP results in the overexpression
of PD-L1 via GSK3β inactivation.33 This enables tumor cells to evade immune assault via the immunosuppressive
activity of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Thus, the combined inhibition
of PARP1 and PD-1/PD-L1 will be a more effective therapeutic solution
than the monotherapy of each.10,33 To test this concept,
we envisioned the use of small-molecule agents as dual inhibitors
of both PARP1 and PD-L1 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Small-molecule drug candidates under investigation in
this report.

Traditionally, combination
therapy has been one of the ways used
to circumvent drug toxicity/resistance associated with monotherapy
in cancer treatment.34 From a clinical
perspective, this strategy is used to either enhance the therapeutic
effect obtained from monotherapy or to obtain a similar therapeutic
effect but has less toxic side effects (dose-limiting toxicities).35 Combination therapy achieves the endpoint of
mild toxicity, right dose, and efficient responses.36 Hybrid drug conjugates are comparable to combination therapies,
and in some cases, exhibit relatively superior drug efficacy.37 Hybrid drug conjugates are designed based on
the merging or linking of the active scaffolds of two or more different
drugs with different and/or the same mechanism into one compound.38 Like combination therapies, hybrid compounds
can be designed based on compounds that target the same protein interaction
via different mechanisms, or it can be based on different interactions
that produce the same therapeutic effect.39 Conjugates offer several added advantages than combination therapies.
These include improved solubility, that is, different partner drugs
may have different solubility; thus, the uptake rates in the blood
may vary at a fixed dose. Additionally, with the freedom to vary linkers
in the design of hybrid compounds, one can use a linker that contributes
effectively to the solubility of the conjugate. The pharmacokinetics
of a single conjugate is also relatively easier to predict, and this
makes it amenable to modifications. Hybrid compounds also offer the
added advantage to do structure–activity relationship studies
more rapidly.38 High-throughput conjugation
chemistries can be adopted to append functionalized monoagents to
desired counterparts, and their biological effects can be evaluated.
This approach is more effective, faster and reduces false positives/negatives
that can be associated with combination therapy of individual agents.

We therefore sought to design and study the cytotoxicity as well
as decipher the related biological profile of small-molecule conjugates
that target both PARP and PD-L1. The constructs display improved potency
in cancers cells. These compounds offer the ability to glean insights
into the PARP/PD-L1 axis and are predictably amenable to structural
modification/studies for the enhanced synergistic antitumor effect.

Results
and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of Dual-Action Conjugates
The
improved efficacy and information gleaned from using combination therapies
provide the basis for the design of hybrid compounds. Inspiration
from the clinically relevant combination therapy involving PARP inhibitors
and mAb PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors led us to design conjugates 1–3. These conjugates were developed by using
the PD-L1 inhibitor, BMS-001, which is a potent small molecule developed
by Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMS), and a well-known PARP1 inhibitor,
olaparib, in current clinical use. We conjectured that the validated
pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of olaparib could compensate
for deficiencies associated with BMS-001. Thus, different analogs
of these conjugates could be synthesized using different spacers.
The piperazine ring of the olaparib derivative is amenable to modification
at the N-terminus; and this does not alter its PARP inhibition properties.
However, if the piperazine ring core in the olaparib framework is
substantially modified or replaced with other bioisosteres, it significantly
alters its cytotoxicity and DNA damaging properties.40 Therefore, we choose to effect modifications at the N-terminus
of the piperazine ring core of the olaparib derivative.

The
design principle was based on restriction and flexibility rules.41,42 Our choice of linkers were informed by preliminary docking studies,
which gave us an insight into the potential of our compounds to outperform
the reference compounds via interaction with the respective human
PARP1 (PDB ID: 4R6E) and PD-L1 (PDB ID: 5N2F) protein structures.43,44 The in silico
interaction of conjugates with PARP1 and PD-L1 proteins is shown in Figure 7 and 8. We envisioned a conjugate
that is capable of targeting both PARP1 and PD-L1 without succumbing
to hydrolysis to release the individual components, hence the design
of conjugate 1. Then, we rationalized that establishing
an ester bond via a linker to the PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitor will
connect the two compounds, and after intracellular hydrolysis, the
intact BMS-001 will be released. This led us to test two different
spacers, namely, hydrocarbon and PEGylated-like linker toward conjugates 2 and 3, respectively. Generally, ethoxy-ethoxy-linker
is supposed to improve cell permeability and the drug transport and
kinetics of these conjugates. The PARPi and BMS-001 compounds were
synthesized according to reported protocols and were purified and
fully characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy.
These compounds were subsequently used in the synthesis of all conjugates
(Scheme 1). Based on
our design strategy, we synthesized 1, direct coupling
of the PD-L1 molecule to the olaparib derivative, PARPi, via an amide
bond.25

Scheme 1 General Reaction Scheme toward the
Synthesis of Small-Molecule PARP/PD-L1
Inhibitor Conjugates
The use of HOBt in the coupling was to avoid unwanted
racemization
of the conjugate at the picolinic acid, which has (S) configuration. Unlike compound 1, different types
of spacers were used as conduits in the hybrid inhibitor design of
conjugates 2 and 3. For 2,
the olaparib derivative, PARPi, was functionalized with bromoethanol
by N-alkylation of the piperazine moiety. The alcohol handle was then
used in an esterification with the carboxyl handle of BMS-001 using
EDCl/HOBt. Similarly, in the synthesis of conjugate 3, the piperazine scaffold (of PARPi) was N-alkylated with chloroethoxyethoxy
followed by esterification with BMS-001. All conjugates were purified
by silica gel column chromatography, recrystallized, and fully characterized
by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS); the purity of the conjugates were ascertained
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Supporting Information, Figures S1−S17). These conjugates were
then used for biological assessment.

Photophysical and Stability
Properties of Conjugates
The UV absorption profile of conjugates 1–3 were measured in a buffered system
as well as Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM), which contains millimolar concentrations
of amino acids and other biomolecules. The conjugates show a characteristic
absorption peak at 260 nm. Stock solutions of 1–3 were prepared in DMSO and subsequently dissolved in PBS
or DMEM. Furthermore, conditioned media, which contain metabolites,
growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins, were also used
to evaluate the photophysical and stability properties of the conjugates.
We monitored the peak at 260 nm over a period of 72 h (Figure 2, and Figures S35–S38). In PBS, the peaks were unaltered, while a
minimal red-shift by 2 nm in the absorption maxima was observed for
conjugate 1 in DMEM at 72 h. Compounds 2 and 3 follow a similar profile as in 1, indicative of relative stability in PBS and DMEM. Experiments in
conditioned media did not deviate from the observation with DMEM.
In addition to the characteristic peak of the conjugates at about
240 nm that remained unaltered during the 72 h study period was a
peak at ∼300 nm, which is likely from an interaction of the
compound with matrix proteins or metabolites from the medium. The
studies suggest that our compounds are fairly stable in DMEM with
characteristic absorption features of the compounds displayed over
the 72 h duration of the experiment. Subsequently, conjugates 1–3 were found to be stable in bovine
serum albumin (pH 5.2) over 72 h. In this experiment, we monitored
the UV–vis absorption profile (Figures S39–S45) and at the end of the experiment subjected
the solution to mass spectrometry (Figures S40–44). We found that the signature m/z corresponding to the exact mass of the conjugates was dominant.
Given that human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in blood,
this study affirms the stability of our conjugates under relevant
biological conditions.

h, and
(right) 1 in conditioned DMEM over 72 h. The compound
concentration was 25 μM. Three replicates were performed for
each experiment.

Microsomal Stability Assay
To understand the metabolism
of our compounds, the synthesized conjugates were subjected to a microsomal
stability assay. Liver microsomes are essentially subcellular fractions
containing membrane-bound drug metabolizing enzymes. The study was
conducted by incubating our compounds at a final concentration of
15 μM with pooled human liver microsomes (0.5 mg ml–1) and then analyzed with UV–vis (Figures S45–S47) and ESI-MS (Figure S48). The conjugates were incubated for
0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min. The UV profiles of the microsomal assay
extracts suggest that conjugates 1–3 are relatively stable to metabolism. Particularly, following the
study involving compound 3, the mass spectrometry showed
the presence of the [M + H] peak at 956.4635 corresponding to the
exact mass of 3. This indicates that after 45 min of
incubation with liver microsomes, there is an unmodified compound.
Overall, the compounds are fairly stable under relevant biological
conditions.

Cellular Response to PARP and PD-L1 Inhibition
We examined
the cytotoxicity of our PARP1/PD-L1 inhibitor conjugates in a panel
of cancerous cell lines. The cell lines selected were from human ovary,
lung, and breast origin. The cells were treated with conjugates 1–3, PARPi, BMS-001, or olaparib alone
in varying concentrations after which cells were incubated for 7 days
and assayed using crystal violet. The inhibitory concentration that
resulted in 50% cell death was extrapolated from dose–response
curves and is summarized in Table 1.

The conjugates, 1–3, displayed
a 2–20-fold improved anticancer efficacy against cancer cells
over individual agents alone. Particularly, the triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC), MDA-MB-231 possess endogenous expression of PD-L145 and represent a recalcitrant tumor subtype for
chemotherapeutic treatment. The cell-killing effect of 3 was five times more potent than the olaparib derivative and ∼9-fold
efficacious by mixing the two individual components in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 3). Dose–response
curves of the compounds under investigation are shown in (Figure 3 and Figures S18–S23). Additionally, the IC50 of olaparib and its derivative (aka PARPi) were similar
for all cell lines studied.

Figure 3 Dose–response curves of 1–3, BMS-001,
PARPi, and olaparib in MDA-MB-231 cells for 7 days. The data were
from three-independent replicates.

Importantly, cancer cells display unique phenotypes and genetic
profiles that include mutated BRCA status and varying PD-L1 expression
levels among others. The cell lines used in this study possess differentiated
BRCA and PD-L1 status as shown in Table 2. The combination index (CI) of olaparib
and BMS-001 was conducted to enable us to determine if there exists
any form of synergy between olaparib and BMS-001.

Combination Effect of BMS-001
and Olaparib
We sought
to determine the combination effect of olaparib, a first-in-class
PARP inhibitor with a small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitor, BMS-001. The
synergy of the combination of BMS-001 with olaparib was determined
using the Chou–Talalay method.46 The combination index (CI) was calculated using Compusyn software,
which computes the combination index based on the Chou–Talalay
CI formula:  

D1 and D2 represent the IC50 of olaparib and BMS-001,
respectively,
whereas Dm1 and Dm2 are the IC50 values of olaparib and BMS-001 alone,
respectively. Based on the CI values, the combination is deemed synergistic,
additive, or antagonistic. If CI < 1, the drug combination pair
is synergistic; CI = 1, the pair is additive; or if CI > 1, the
pair
is antagonistic. Further classifications are as follows: (1) if CI
<0.7, then the pair exhibits strong synergy, (2) 0.7–0.85
implies moderate synergism,(3) 0.85–0.9 implies slight synergism,
(4) 1.0 implies an additive pair, and (5) if CI >1, it is antagonistic.
Notably, olaparib–BMS-001 combinations that are cytotoxic to
90% of cells (Fa = 0.9) after 72 h were determined across all cell
lines as displayed in Figures S24–S33. The combination of olaparib–BMS-001 was found to be synergistic
across several molar ratio points in a panel of cell lines (Table 3). Most importantly,
at 1:1 combination ratio, the olaparib–BMS-001 pair was found
that to be synergistic across the selected cell lines. This implies
that an equimolar presence of olaparib and for that matter PARPi with
BMS-001 potentiates cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Consistent with
this observation is the cytotoxicity results of the conjugates that
show an improved antiproliferative effect. Taken together, coefficients
of synergy were established for the treatment of cancer cells by BMS-001
and olaparib, which corroborates dual targeting of PD-L1 and PARP.

slight synergism (aqua)). Column headers indicate the olaparib–BMS-001
ratio.

Apoptosis
Furthermore,
we sought to understand how
the conjugates affected cell death, in the context of apoptosis. MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 10 μM compounds—BMS-001, olaparib,
PARPi, 1, 2, or 3. As depicted
in Figure 4, 1–3 induced significant
early- to late-stage apoptosis-mediated cell death: 26% for compound 1, 60% for 2, and 60% for 3. Comparatively,
olaparib (25%) and PARPi (22%) exhibited a relatively lower early-
to late-stage apoptosis-related cell death. BMS-001 also showed ∼19%
early- to late-stage apoptosis-related cell death. Specifically, we
observed a large cell population occurring at late-stage apoptosis
for compounds 2 and 3 as shown in Figure 4. The conjugates
showed enhanced in vitro potency via late-stage apoptosis in comparison
to PARP and PD-L1 inhibitor moieties.

Figure 4 FITC Annexin V/PI apoptosis dead cell
assay detect apoptosis in
MDA-MB-231 cells. The percentages of early apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI–, gray) and late apoptotic (Annexin
V+/PI+, black) cells were quantified. Data are
presented as mean ± SD and were representative of three independent
biological experiments.

Additionally, these data imply that the potency of conjugates
(1–3) is not additive but rather synergistic.
Taken
together, these results are consistent with studies that show tumor
growth inhibition by combining olaparib and anti-PD-L1 mAb. It is
worth noting that several clinical trials are currently on going to
evaluate the combined effect of FDA approved PARP1 inhibitors and
immune checkpoint antibodies. Effective small-molecule alternatives
could be a game-changer while reducing adverse immunologic effects.

PARP1 and PD-L1 Potentiation by Conjugates
Effect on PARP
Intracellular effects of the compounds
under investigation in this report were examined using immunoblotting.
Modulation of PARP by 1–3 in cells
was evaluated by immunoblotting, using cancer cells that endogenously
expressed PD-L1 (Figure 5a). Consequently, H460 (lung) cells were treated with 10 or 20 μM
of various compounds for 24 h and analyzed by Western blotting. In
addition, MDA-MB-231 (breast) cells were treated with 10 μM,
and lysates were collected for 24, 48, and 72 h for Western blotting.
It is evident that H460 cells treated with the conjugates inhibited
PARP in a dose-dependent manner. The conjugates equally inhibit PARP
in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5b), implying that the various conjugates potentiate PARP expression.
It can be inferred from our design principle that all the conjugates
(1–3) possess a PARP inhibiting scaffold
whose functional activity remains uncompromised, at least at the cellular
level. This is consistent with our docking studies where all our conjugates
interacted specifically with amino acid residues in the catalytic
domain of the PARP1 protein (vide infra).

Figure 5 (a) H460 or (b) MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with compounds 1–3 for indicated time points (24–72
h) and concentration (10 or 20 μM). Lysates were generated and
subjected to immunoblotting. Densitometric quantification of blots
are shown on the right of each blot. Data were analyzed as mean ±
SD and were representative of three independent biological experiments.

PARP Inhibition Upregulates
PD-L1
The inhibition of
PARP leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 in some cancer cells.14 The PD-1/PD-L1-mediated anticancer suppression
requires the inhibition of the coupling of PD-1 to its endogenous
peptidic partner, PD-L1, implying that if either PD-L1 or PD-1 can
be upregulated, then the inhibition of this pathway becomes relatively
easier. Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells endogenously express the PD-L1 protein,
and the PD-1/PD-L1 ligation occurs at the cell surface, leading to
immunosuppressive effects.47 To determine
if our conjugates as well as the reference PARP inhibitors can downregulate
cell surface PD-L1, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 μM
conjugates, and reference compounds for 24 h, and subsequently incubated
with a fluorophore-labeled PD-L1 antibody and then subjected to FACS
(Figure 6). Cell surface
PD-L1 was upregulated in cells, after treatment with olaparib and
PARPi. However, they were downregulated after treatment with BMS-001
and the conjugates 1–3. Importantly, 3 was found to significantly downregulate cell surface PD-L1
than the reference PD-L1 inhibitor, BMS-001, establishing it as our
best candidate for PD-L1 inhibition.

Figure 6 PARP inhibition upregulates PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231
cells and can be
attenuated by small-molecule inhibitors of PD-L1. Treated cells were
subjected to FACS after 24 h of treatment with compounds. Quadruplicate
experiments were performed.

Molecular Docking Insights
Insight into the interaction
of these dual-action conjugates will be beneficial for further optimization
and discovery. Therefore, we sought to study the interaction of our
conjugates with the various proteins (herein, PARP and PD-L1) under
study. To unravel, with cheminformatic finesse, the possibility of
our conjugates to interrogate both PARP and PD-L1 proteins, we prepared
and docked our conjugates into the crystal structures of the respective
protein structures. SYBYL-X molecular modeling and simulation suite
(version 2.1) was used for the generation of the relevant protonated
and tautomeric molecular forms of PARPi and the conjugates. The preparation
of the crystal structures of the proteins and ligand files can be
found elsewhere (see Experimental Section).
PARP has three functional domains: the automodification domain, N-terminal
DNA-binding, and C-terminal catalytic domain.48,49 The PARP1 catalytic domain has a major donor site (ART domain),
which possesses a β-α-loop-β-α signature NAD+-specific binding motif.50 Conjugate 3 and PARPi share a similar scaffold in that their phthalazinone
moiety is a nicotinamide mimic. Therefore, it is expected that both
will bind to the nicotinamide-specific binding pocket (NI site). Unsurprisingly, 3 and reference compound, PARPi, both bind to the PARP protein
in the NI site of its C-terminal catalytic domain. Conjugate 3 anchors itself into this nicotinamide-specific binding pocket
(NI site) via several hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions
(Figure 7a). More precisely, the carboxamide portion of the
phthalizinone functional group of conjugate 3 forms two
hydrogen bonds with Arg865 (αJ) and Tyr896 (βd) in the
NI site of the PARP1 catalytic domain. But PARPi interacts via the
carbonyl of its phthalizinone with Met890 (D-loop) in the NI site.
Additional π–π interactions in Tyr907 also stabilize
conjugate 3 in the NI region. Both PARPi and conjugate 3 interact with the glutamine backbone (Gln759) within the
phosphate binding site (PH site). However, conjugate 3 also extends into other parts of the donor site of PARP1’s
catalytic domain. Conjugate 3 forms hydrogen bond networks
with histidine and arginine residues (His862 and Arg865, respectively),
which are in the adenine ribose-binding (AD) pocket of the catalytic
domain. It can be inferred from previous research that potency and
selectivity can be conferred to inhibitors simply by extending reactive
side groups from the NI site into other binding pockets of the catalytic
domain.50 We propose that as conjugate 3 sprawls into the AD site, it is expected that enhanced PARP
inhibition will be achieved.

as Phe19, Tyr56, Glu58, Gln66, Arg113, Met115, and Tyr123.17,51 Docking results show that interaction of conjugate 3 and BMS-001 within the binding cleft of the PD-L1 dimer via a miscellany
of interactions: hydrogen bonding, salt bridge interactions, and hydrophobic
interactions (Figure 8). In addition to the two hydrogen bonds
formed between the O atom on the ethoxy-ethoxy-linker of conjugate 3 with the Arg113 residues in the binding pocket, there exists
further hydrogen bond stabilization between the carbonyl in proxy
to the piperazine ring (of 3) with the Asp63 side chain
(Figure 8b). Other
noncovalent interactions, π–π interactions with
tyrosine residues, in the binding cleft further stabilize conjugate 3. These modeling results suggest that there is no loss of
functionality, in the context of PARP and PD-L1 inhibition profiles
of 3. Rather, these properties are predicted to be enhanced
in the conjugates.

isoleucine, and arginine amino acid residues (depicted as gray sticks)

Cell Cycle Studies
To gain insight into the DNA content
response to the dual-action agents, cell cycle studies were conducted
in the presence or absence of compound 3, olaparib, and
BMS-001 (Figure 9a,b).
Cells were treated with 5 μM of various compounds, at 24 and
48 h incubation points, and then subjected to flow cytometric propidium
iodide analysis. After 24 h of treatment with compound 3, an increase in the fraction of cells in the G1 phase was observed,
that is, 71.07% in untreated cells to 75.56% in cells incubated with 3. Consistent with 3, olaparib and BMS-001 induced
G1 phase accumulation after 24 h (Figure 9c). Changes in the number of cells in the
S phase for 3-treated cells peaked at 48 h and returned
to initial levels by 72 h, whereas negligible changes were observed
for olaparib and BMS-001 under the same duration. Recent studies on
the combination of cyclic-dependent kinase inhibitor, dinaciclib and
PARP inhibition in TNBCs demonstrate increased sub-G1 cell cycle population.52 This is quite consistent with our observation
of 3 in MDA-MB-231 cells.

were representative of three independent biological experiments.

T-Cell Proliferation
We investigated the functional
activity of PD-L1 modulation by studying the proliferation of T-cells
co-cultured with PD-L1 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Following the
hypothesis that PD-L1 upregulation in cancer cells renders the cells
resistant to T-cell killing, we studied the effect of PD-L1 inhibition
by our conjugates on T-cell proliferation. Briefly, human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated with 100 ng/mL CD3
antibody, 100 ng/mL CD28 antibody, and 10 ng/mL r-IL-2. The activated
PBMCs were labeled with carboxyfluoresceine succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
and co-cultured with conjugate-treated or untreated MDA-MB-231cells.
The labeled PBMCs were subjected to FACS analysis on day 0 and day
5 (Figure 10). After
the 5 day treatment, co-cultured T-cells with MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with 1–3 proliferated exponentially
with complete reduction of the fluorescent signal corresponding to
original T-cell population and the consequent formation of multiple
peaks arising from dye dilution due to cell division. This implies
that PD-L1 inhibition induced by our conjugates promotes proliferation
and may restore immunity by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1.

PBMCs co-cultured with treated or untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. Three
independent experiments with different PBMCs were used.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed small-molecule hybrid inhibitors
of PARP and PD-L1. The compounds were synthesized and well-characterized,
and their purity was confirmed. In all our biological characterization,
our conjugates, 1–3, offered superior
synergistic cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and PD-L1 inhibition than the
individual inhibitors, BMS-001 and PARPi alone. Additionally, these
compounds act as proof-of-concept tools to delineate the PARP1/PD-L1
axis to better understand the cross-talk that exist between these
pathways. Using molecular docking, we gleaned insights into the interaction
of small-molecule conjugates with the respective proteins, offering
the opportunity for further optimization and discovery of more efficacious
dual-action compounds. Future studies outlined include intracellular
kinetic rates of interaction of the compounds with its respective
targets, in vivo studies using syngeneic breast cancer mouse models
and detailed PARP1/PD-L1 characterization in vivo.

viability was assessed via the crystal violet assay. Measurements
of absorbance were subsequently performed using a GENios plate reader
at 570 nm (peak absorbance). All experiments were conducted in triplicates.
Also, cell viability experiments were done to study the synergy of
olaparib and BMS001, at increasing concentrations for 72 hours.

Apoptosis Studies
MDA-MB-231 cells (500,000 cells per
well) were plated into six-well plates for 24 h. After complete adhesion,
the cells were treated with olaparib, BMS-001, or 1–3 at a fixed concentration (10 μM) for 48 h and harvested
by trypsinization. The Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD
Biosciences), according to the manufacturer protocol, was used to
determine the fraction of cells that underwent apoptosis, using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis (BD Biosciences, USA) and by following
the manufacturer protocol. The data were analyzed by FlowJo software.

Cell Cycle Analysis
MDA-MB-231 cells (500,000 cells
per well) were plated into six-well plates for 24 h. After complete
adhesion, the cells were treated with a fixed concentration (5 μM)
of olaparib, BMS-001, 1, 2, or 3, along with the various untreated controls for 24, 48, and 72 h.
The cells were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted. The collected
pellets were washed twice with 1 mL of PBS. Fifty microliters of 100
μg/mL RNase solution was added and incubated on ice for 20 min.
Two hundred microliters of 50 μg/mL propidium iodide solution
was added to each sample, resuspended, and filtered through the cell
strainer cap of a 5 mL Corning Falcon test tube. Then, the samples
were analyzed with flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed using
Modfit.

Immunoblotting
MDA-MB-231 cells in a fresh complete
medium were plated (500,000 cells per well) into six-well plates for
24 h. After complete adhesion, cells were treated with olaparib or
the conjugates, 1–3 at concentration
of 10 μM for 24 h, 48, and 72 h, scraped into SDS-PAGE loading
buffer (64 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)/9.6% glycerol/2% SDS/5% β-mercaptoethanol/0.01%
bromophenol blue), and incubated at 95 °C on a heat block for
10 min. The cell samples were cooled and stored at −20 °C
until ready for use. Whole cell lysates were resolved by 4–20%
sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE,
200 V for 25 min) followed by electrotransfer to the polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane, PVDF (350 mA for 1 h). Membranes were incubated
in blocking buffer containing using 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in TBST (TBS/0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently,
the membranes were probed separately with PARP or β-actin, primary
antibodies (Cell Signaling, USA) in blocking buffer overnight at 4
°C (Cell Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA).
After washing three times, over a period of 15 min, with TBST (3 ×
5 mL), the membrane was incubated with the related alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) in fresh BSA blocking
solution. Protein–antibody conjugates were visualized using
one-step NBT–BCIP (nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indoyl phosphate p-toluidine
(BCIP)) visualization solution (Thermo Fisher, USA), according to
the manufacturer instruction. Images of the blots were then digitally
obtained.

Detection of Cell Surface PD-L1
MDA-MB-231 cells (500,000
cells per well) were plated in a six-well plate and treated with the
various compounds—PARPi, olaparib, BMS-001, compounds 1, 2, or 3. For the detection of
cell surface PD-L1, MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in 100 μL
of cell staining buffer (#420201, BioLegend) and incubated with the
APC-conjugated anti-human PD-L1 antibody (#329708, BioLegend) on ice
for 30 min. After washing in the staining buffer, the stained cells
were analyzed by FACS.

Stability Studies of Conjugates
A DMSO stock solution
of 1, 2, or 3 was diluted to
25 μM solutions with either PBS or DMEM. Three milliliters of
each sample was aliquoted into a cuvette, and the absorbance was measured
on a Shimadzu UV-1280 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The data were
plotted using GraphPad Prism.

Molecular Modeling
Compound
Database
The structure of olaparib (in .mol2)
was downloaded from the ZINC database. The structures of 1, 2, 3, PARPi, and BMS-001 were drawn with
Chemdraw software and prepared into a 3D .sdf/.mol file by using the
ligand preparation tool in SYBYL-X

Protein Preparation
The crystal structure of the PARP1
protein bound with niraparib (PDB: 4R6E) and PD-L1 protein in complex with small
molecule, 4-[[4-[[3-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-2-methyl-phenyl]methoxy]-2,5-bis(fluoranyl)phenyl]methylamino]-3-oxidanylidene-butanoic
acid, (PDB: 5N2F) was retrieved from the RSCB Protein Data Bank was downloaded from
the protein data as .pdb file. This file was imported into the SYBYL
working panel and converted into a .mol2 file. The small molecule,
4-[[4-[[3-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-2-methyl-phenyl]methoxy]-2,5-bis(fluoranyl)phenyl]methylamino]-3-oxidanylidene-butanoic
acid, was selected and removed from the 5N2F protein. Polar hydrogens were added,
as water molecules were deleted. The termini/amide chains as well
as B-factors were corrected. Gasteiger–Marsili charges were
then added, and the protonation states were set to 7.4 (physiological).
Equally, similar protocol was followed in preparing the human PARP
protein, 4R6E; after the ligand, niraparib have been removed

Ligand Screening
To initiate the docking process, protomols
were generated from the interfacial amino acid residues within the
active sites of both the PARP1 and PD-L1 proteins. Then, the generated
3D structure set was docked into the protomol, scored, and ranked.
To validate the docking method, the removed ligands were docked back
in the prepared protein active site. The corresponding pose of the
ligands were similar to its original form in the crystal structures,
implying that our docking method is reliable.
