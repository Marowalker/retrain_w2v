This
review deals with the recent applications of the indium trichloride
(InCl3) catalyst in the synthesis of a broad spectrum of
heterocyclic compounds. Over the years, a number of reviews on the
applications of InCl3-catalyzed organic synthesis have
appeared in the literature. It is evident that InCl3 has
emerged as a valuable catalyst for a wide range of organic transformations
due to its stability when exposed to moisture and also in an aqueous
medium. The most attractive feature of this review is the application
of the InCl3 catalyst for synthesizing bioactive heterocyclic
compounds. The study of InCl3-catalyzed organic reactions
has high potential and better intriguing aspects, which are anticipated
to originate from this field of research.

1 Introduction
Lewis acid catalysis has
brought a radical change in the approach toward the synthesis of a
large number of important organic intermediates and heterocyclic compounds
having significant biological activity.1a The common Lewis acids which are generally used for various organic
transformations include AlCl3, BF3·Et2O, ZnCl2, TiCl4, and SnCl2. Although indium (In) belongs to the same group in the periodic
table as boron (B) and aluminum (Al), the study of indium and its
salts was unexplored until recently.1b Indium
and its salts have found applications in the preparation of alloys
to be used as medical diagnostic agents for the health sector and
equipment for the electronic industry.2a−2d The ability of indium(III) salts
to react with organic compounds to form an in situ organoindium species
has largely eliminated the use of sensitive, toxic, and explosive
organometallics.3a The effectiveness of
InCl3 as a Lewis acid catalyst has sustained immense interest
due to its moisture compatibility, which enhances its use in a wide
range of solvents including water. Moreover, nontoxicity, abundance,
recyclability, and excellent catalytic activity3b of InCl3 afforded high chemo- and regioselectivity
in various organic transformations.2a−2d These advantages of InCl3 inspired us to write a review highlighting its catalytic
applications in the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycles.

2 Synthesis of N-Heterocycles
N-Heterocycles constitute
the core scaffolds of many natural products and pharmaceutical agents.
The syntheses of these N-heterocycles are very challenging, and the
development of methodologies for their synthesis provided us with
unique metal catalysts, but many of them are hazardous and expensive.
Among them, InCl3 was found to be inexpensive, moisture
friendly, and reactive even in mild conditions.2a−2d,3a,3b

Scheme 20 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of Pyridopyrimidine Derivatives
A facile and regioselective synthesis of polysubstituted
pyrroles 73 have been reported by Muthusubramanian and

3 Synthesis of O-Heterocycles
Indium and its salts have been extensively used for alkylation,
allylation, and alenylation reactions in water.8a,8b Therefore, InCl3-catalyzed synthesis of bioactive compounds
in water is the decent choice for researchers for the development
of pharmaceutical agents with less or no toxicity. Among various O-heterocycles,
chromanes were found in many important natural products and were reported
to have significant biological importance.9 Synthesis of these compounds in water has been a topic of interest
to medicinal chemistry researchers.

Kang et al.10 reported an intramolecular allylation of carbonyl/imine 95 to chromane 96 in the presence of In, InCl3, and Pd(PPh3)4 in water with high yield
(Scheme 28). The main
advantage of using indium along with InCl3 was to generate
active InCl, which was responsible for the generation of an organoindium
complex via transmetalation from an organopalladium complex followed
by allylation.

synthetic methodology for the synthesis of oxa-aza bicyclononene scaffolds
which have presumed importance in the field of drug discovery. They
have demonstrated a three-component coupling (3CC) of glycal 182, 1,3-dicarbonyl compound 51, and arylamine 40 in the presence of 10 mol % of InCl3 in DCE
under refluxing conditions. This reaction afforded oxa-aza bicyclononene 183 in 93% isolated yield and high stereoselectivity (Scheme 57).

Scheme 57 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of Oxa-Aza Bicyclononene Derivatives
For more than a decade, our group also worked
on the InCl3-catalyzed synthesis of heterocycles.22 We explored the use of the InCl3 catalyst
in the synthesis of four different types of heterocyclic compounds,
which included substituted furans, pyrroles, bipyrroles, and pyrones.
We reacted 1,2-diaroylethylene 184 with various β-dicarbonyls 51 in the presence of a catalytic amount of InCl3, which resulted in the formation of tetra-substituted furan 186. In the presence of ammonium acetate (NH4OAc),
the reaction between 51 and 184 yielded
substituted pyrrole 187. The treatment of diaroylacetylene 185 with 51 and NH4OAc yielded (±)-3,3′-bipyrrole 188. In the absence of NH4OAc, 51 reacted
with 185 to afford substituted 2-pyrone 189 in very good yield and not the expected(±)-3,3′-bifuran 190 (Scheme 58).

Scheme 58 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of Broad Spectrum of Heterocycles
Reddy et al.23 developed
a novel one-pot synthesis of oxa-aza bicycle 194 from
the δ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated sugar aldehyde (Perlin
aldehyde) 191, arylamine 192, and 1,3-dicarbonyl
compound 193 in the presence of 10 mol % of InCl3 in acetonitrile at 80 °C. Initially, the aryl amine
reacted with the 1,3-dicarbonyl to form β-enamino ketones, which
subsequently coupled with the Perlin aldehyde to produce oxa-aza bicycles
in good yields with high selectivity (Scheme 59).

Scheme 59 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis
of Oxa-Aza Bicycles
Yadav et al.12e found that in the presence of a catalytic amount
of InCl3 a tandem Michael addition and intramolecular Friedel–Crafts-type
cyclization occurred under mild conditions between δ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde 195 and arylamine 196 to afford
fused heterocycle 197 in good yield and excellent stereoselectivity
(Scheme 60).

Scheme 60 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of Fused Tetrahydroquinolines
A systematic and comprehensive study on the
synthesis of 3H-(pyrrol-1-yl)indolin-2-one 200 was reported by Ji et al.24 Various isatin derivatives 198 and 4-hydroxyproline 199 were reacted in the presence of 10 mol % of InCl3 under ambient reaction conditions to afford the products in excellent
yields up to 99% (Scheme 61).

Scheme 61 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of 3-Pyrrolylindolones
Yadav et al.12f described
a cycloaddition reaction of aryl amine 40 with 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran 33 in the presence of the InCl3 catalyst under mild reaction conditions to afford the corresponding
pyrano[3,2-c]quinoline 201 with high
diastereoselectivity (Scheme 62).

Scheme 62 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis of Pyranoquinolines
Raghunathan et al.25 demonstrated the synthesis of tetrahydropyrazolo[4′,3′:5,6]thiopyrano[4,3-b]quinolines catalyzed by InCl3 under mild conditions
(Scheme 63). The products
were obtained as a diastereomeric mixture of cis-isomer 204 as the major product and the trans-isomer 205 as the minor product.

Scheme 63 InCl3-Catalyzed Synthesis
of Pyrazole-Fused Thiopyranoquinolines
5 Conclusions
This review encompasses catalytic applications
of InCl3 for synthesizing a wide range of heterocycles.
It is evident from the above discussion that InCl3 is a
valuable Lewis acid catalyst for the synthesis of many heterocyclic
scaffolds. The most attractive feature of this review is the application
of InCl3 to catalyze reactions in both organic and/or aqueous
media with almost equal feasibility. It exhibits unique activity in
this area owing to its high coordination number and fast coordination–dissociation
equilibrium maintenance. In contrast, the application of InCl3 along with a chiral auxiliary in asymmetric synthesis is
still largely unexplored. Thus, the future of this area lies in the
development of an enantioselective InCl3 catalyst which
may be air- and water-insensitive. Hence, InCl3-catalyzed
reactions have a huge potential for application in organic synthesis
and green chemistry.
