The development of organic molecules
to target nucleic acid is
an active area of research at the interface of chemistry and biochemistry,
which involves DNA binding, nuclear imaging, and antitumor studies.
These molecules bind with DNA through covalent interactions, electrostatic
interactions, or intercalation. However, they are less permeable to
membrane, and they have a significant cytotoxicity, which limits their
application under in vivo conditions. In the present work, various
mono- and disubstituted 1,8-naphthalimides-based derivatives (S-12, S-13, S-15, and S-21) have been synthesized and characterized through various spectroscopic
techniques. Among these, 3-amino-4-bromo-1,8-naphthalimide (S-15) was found to have an attractive water solubility and
act as a nuclear imaging agent. The spectroscopic absorption and emission
data showed that S-15 has a strong affinity for salmon
sperm DNA with a binding constant of 6.61 × 104 M–1, and the ratiometric fluorescence intensity (I489/I552) of S-15 has a linear relationship in the 0–50 μM
range of DNA concentrations. It intercalates with DNA through the
hydrophobic planar naphthalimide core as confirmed through cyclic
voltammetry, circular dichroism, 1H NMR titration, and
thermal denaturation studies. Positively charged amine groups also
participate in H-bonding with the bases and backbone of DNA. The S-15 intercalator showed a large Stokes shift and photostability,
which made it attractive for direct imaging of Legionella
pneumophila, without the need for a prior membrane
permeabilization.

Introduction
Recently, extensive
work has been carried out to understand DNA
organization, replication, and structure within the cell.1,2 To achieve this goal, various dyes and metal complexes having imaging
and therapeutic properties were designed and synthesized.3−8 These dyes bind either covalently or non-covalently to DNA and behave
as chemotherapeutic anticancer agents.5,9,10 Unfortunately, poor membrane permeability, low water
solubility, high toxicity, and photobleaching limit their application
under in vivo conditions.11 The traditional
DNA dyes employed in cell imaging are categorized into two types:12 (a) 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
SYTO, and Hoechst stains, which are cell permeable and can be used
for live cell imaging. Among these, DAPI and Hoechst stains require
ultraviolet light for excitation, which may lead to DNA photodamage.13 However, SYTO requires visible and near-infrared
light as illumination, but low selectivity for nucleus hinders its
application in cell imaging;14 (b) thiazole
orange ethidium bromide (EtBr, 3,8-diamino-5-ethyl-6-phenylphenanthridinium
bromide) and propidium iodide dyes, which bind to DNA through intercalation,
but they are poorly internalized by cell. Therefore, these dyes cannot
be used for direct imaging of cell nucleus.

In addition to these
points, conventional dyes have small Stokes
shift (difference between emission and excitation wavelength) value
usually less than 50 nm.15−17 The large Stokes shift is a prerequisite
to the sensitivity of fluorescence imaging because it minimizes the
interaction between emission photons and excitation photons and gives
high signal-to-noise ratio.18−20 To address these issues, it is
essential to carefully investigate the cell permeability, DNA binding
ability, cytotoxicity, and photostability of DNA binding molecule.
This information will act as a guide for the design of novel DNA binding
molecule and imaging agent.

Recently, 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives
have been extensively studied
as cellular imaging agents and DNA intercalators.21 They also exhibited an excellent antitumor activities under
in vivo and in vitro conditions.22−29 4-Bromo-1,8-naphthalimide has been reported as an excellent inhibitor
for enveloped viruses in blood and in blood products.30−32 Other two main members of naphthalimide derivatives, amonafide (3-amino-1,8-naphthalimide)
and mitonafide (3-nitro-1,8-naphthalimide), displayed a high antitumor
activity (IC50 0.47 and 8.80 μM, respectively), and
both have entered phase II clinical trials.33,34 These compounds have high affinity for DNA and represent an important
class of DNA-intercalator agent.35 They
induce DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross linking,36,37 and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis33 and
interfering topoisomerase II activity.38,39 From structure–activity
relationship point of view, 3 and 4 positions substituted 1,8-naphthalimides
have high activity, particularly 3-amino substituted.33,34 To take this advantage, we are proposing 3-amino-4-bromo-1,8-naphthalimide
as a DNA intercalator that is further utilized as an imaging agent
for direct imaging of Legionella pneumophila without any pretreatment.

Photophysical properties of 1,8-naphthalimides
can be tuned through
substitution at proper place. The functionalization with amino group
at the 3 and 4 positions of the naphthalimide ring shifts the absorbance
and emission maximum to the visible region. These 3- and 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide
derivatives have high photostability and large Stokes shift in various
aqueous and non-aqueous solvents.40 Internal
charge transfer (ICT) is attributed to these beneficial photophysical
properties, which arises from electronic push–pull between
the electron-withdrawing imide group and the electron-donating amino
group.40−48 Thus, these derivatives have been extensively employed in the development
of chemosensors for metal ions, anions, and biomolecules.40−42,49−51 Nonetheless,
their role as an imaging agent under in vivo and in vitro conditions
has not been sufficiently explored. We synthesized four 1,8-naphthalimide-based
derivatives (S-12, S-13, S-15, and S-21) and found that S-15 has an
attractive water solubility, cell permeability, and high affinity
to bind with DNA. The DNA-binding mechanism of S-15 was
studied using UV–visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy,
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, 1H NMR titration,
and cyclic voltammetry. We were not able to observe fluorescence from
UV-exposed L. pneumophila treated with S-15. However, a clear fluorescence was observed for S-15 treated with both live and heat killed L. pneumophila consistent with the expected reaction
between S-15 and bacterial DNA.

Results and Discussion
Schemes 1 and 2 illustrate the synthetic route for S-12, S-13, S-15, and S-21. Compounds S-12, S-13, and S-21 were synthesized
from a common precursor, 3-nitronaphthalimides (1), as
shown in Scheme 1.
The latter was synthesized through nitration of 1,8-naphthalimide.
3-Nitronaphthalimide with a particular amine refluxed and gave corresponding
products S-12, S-13, and S-21 with 65, 65, and 68% yields, respectively (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of S-12, S-13, and S-21
Scheme 2 Synthesis of S-15
Compound S-15 was prepared through a series
of steps,
as illustrated in Scheme 2. First, 1,8-naphthalimide underwent bromination to give 2 with a 62% yield. It was followed by nitration with H2SO4 and HNO3 and gave 3 with a 65% yield. Then, compound 3 underwent reduction
with SnCl2/HCl and gave compound 4. This compound
was further refluxed with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to obtain S-15 with a 72% yield. All compounds thus obtained were characterized
using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) analytical techniques (see Supporting Information, Figures S1–S12).

The
photophysical properties of the naphthalimide derivatives (S-12, S-13, S-15, and S-21) were
recorded with UV–visible spectrophotometer and fluorescence.
These compounds are known to be soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
but for biological applications, water solubility is essential. Therefore,
we investigated the solubility of these derivatives in different fractions
of water up to 80%. We found that up to 40% water fraction, a slight
increase in the emission intensity takes place for all compounds,
as illustrated in Figure 1. However, S-12, S-13, and S-21 precipitated when the water content was increased to
60% (see Supporting Information, Figure
S13) and their emission intensity decreased, as illustrated in Figure 1A,B,D, respectively.
On further increase in water fraction (80%), more precipitation was
observed in the cuvette, which led to decrease in the emission intensity
of these compounds (Figure 1). In contrast, S-15 showed an enhancement in
the emission intensity at 552 nm up to 60% water fraction, as illustrated
in Figure 1C, and no
precipitate was noticed in the solution (see Supporting Information, Figure S13). The enhancement in emission intensity
with increasing water fraction up to 60% is because of ICT.52 However, further increase in water fraction
led to quenching in the emission behavior of S-15. This
quenching phenomenon may be the result of aggregation. To check the
possibility of nanoaggregates formation, the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) study was performed.

Figure 1 (A–D) Represent change in the emission
spectra of S-12 (10 μM), S-13 (10
μM), S-15 (10 μM), and S-21 (10
μM) in
different fractions of DMSO/H2O.

No aggregate formation was observed for S-15 in 60%
water fraction, as shown in Figure 2A. However, at 80% water fraction, aggregates were
formed with a wide range of size, as shown in Figure 2B. DLS study indicated that aggregation-caused
quenching is the responsible phenomenon for the decrease in emission
intensity.53,54 In addition, specific solvent–solute
interactions may have also played a role in quenching of emission
intensity at higher water fraction.55 Thus,
both these effects increase the non-radiative decay rates at 80% water
fraction56,57

Figure 2 DLS spectra of S-15 (10 μM)
in (A) 60 and (B)
80% water fraction, respectively.

The water fraction study illustrates that only S-15 has more water solubility compared to other derivatives. Consequently,
60% water fraction of S-15 was selected to carry out
the further experiments. The absorption and emission spectra of a
10 μM S-15 in DMSO/H2O (4:6, v/v) solvent
system are shown in Figure 3. An intense band at 342 nm is because of π–π*
transitions,21,52,58 and the broad visible band at 413 nm has been assigned to an ICT
transition. It can be seen that S-15 exhibits a large
Stokes shift of ∼139 nm. Also, we found that S-15 obeys the Beer–Lambert law at concentration of up to 80 μM
in DMSO/H2O (4:6, v/v) solvent system, in agreement with
literature data,56 which suggests that
only monomeric form of S-15 exists under these conditions.
To further investigate this effect, a set of solutions was prepared
with S-15 at 80, 100, and 150 μM concentrations.
Our DLS experiments revealed that the aggregates form at concentration
increased to 100 and 150 μM (see Supporting Information, Figure S14), consistent with the formation of
π–π stacking observed at higher concentrations
of 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives.56 Thus,
in the present study, 10 and 30 μM solutions were used for DNA
binding and imaging, respectively, that is, where no aggregates were
expected to form. To investigate photostability, the emission intensity
of S-15 at 552 nm was recorded with time, and it can
be seen that emission intensity did not decrease significantly even
up to 6 h (see Supporting Information,
Figure S15).

Figure 3 UV–visible absorption spectra and fluorescence
spectra (λex = 430 nm; Ex. and Em. slit width 10
nm) of S-15 (10 μM) in DMSO/H2O (4:6,
v/v) solvent system.

The DNA-binding ability of S-15 was probed through
monitoring absorption bands. The stock solution of salmon sperm-DNA
(100 μM, pH 7.5) was prepared in tris-HCl buffer. The addition
of DNA solution at 50 μM into S-15 resulted in
decreased absorbance at 342 and 413 nm, as shown in Figure 4A. The half-reciprocal plot
shown in Figure 4B
illustrates a dependence between the absorbance at 413 mm and the
concentration of salmon sperm DNA. A continuous decrease in absorbance
was observed followed by the saturation at high concentration of DNA
(inset in Figure 4A).
The decrease in absorbance was more than 50%. The intrinsic binding
constant (K) was calculated using the following equation59 1  where D is the concentration
of DNA in base pairs, Δεap = [εa – εF], Δε = [εB – εF], εa is apparent extinction
coefficient (Aobsd/[S-15]),
and εB and εF correspond to the
apparent extinction coefficient of bound and free form of S-15, respectively. The K value for a base pair was
determined at 6.61 × 104 M–1. The
large hypochromic shift is characteristic of intercalation,12,58 and it indicates the close proximity of the S-15 to
the DNA bases.59

μM) in the presence of increasing concentration of salmon sperm
DNA (0–50 μM) in DMSO/H2O (4:6, v/v) solvent
system; inset represents plot of Ao/A vs concentration of DNA (μM); (B) half-reciprocal
plot of S-15 binding with salmon sperm DNA as calculated
from the UV–visible absorption titration.

To study the excited-state interaction with DNA, fluorescence
titration
was performed. The stepwise addition of DNA into the solution of S-15 resulted in a decreased emission at 552 nm and an enhanced
emission at 489 nm, as shown in Figure 5A. The titration also showed a single isosbestic point
at 514 nm for all DNA concentration (Figure 5A). It represents the existence of two types
of distinct species. The ratiometric intensity (I489/I552) has a linear relationship
with a range (0–50 μM) of DNA concentration (Figure 5B). The inset in Figure 5A shows a decrease
in normalized intensity at 552 nm with the addition of DNA. This decrease
in intensity may be aroused because of transfer of electron from the
nucleotide to naphthalimide.60 The binding
constant was calculated using fluorescence data and was found to be
7.27 × 104 M–1 (see Supporting Information, Figure S16). The absorption
and emission spectroscopy suggest that S-15 binds with
DNA through intercalation, with the planar naphthalimide core and
positively charged amine groups responsible for this mode of interaction.
In addition to emission and absorption spectroscopic evidences for
intercalation mode of binding, 1H NMR titration of S-15 was performed with DNA. The titration was performed through
addition of different amounts of DNA (in D2O) into the
solution of S-15, and each addition was followed by 1H NMR measurement. Figure S17 represents
the change in the aromatic proton region of S-15 in different
amounts of DNA. As the concentration of DNA increased, aromatic proton
of S-15 showed upfield shift along with signal broadening.
This particular change corresponds to intercalative mode of binding.61

The binding mechanism
was also confirmed through thermal denaturation
study. Thermal denaturation studies are an attractive technique to
investigate the interaction between small molecules and DNA. The binding
of added molecules with DNA double helix results in increase in the
melting temperature (Tm) (temperature
at which DNA duplex is half denatured). As shown in Figure S18, absorbance at 260 nm of DNA (50 μM) was
recorded in the presence and absence of S-15 (10 μM)
in the temperature range of 50–90 °C; ΔTm was found to be 7.0 °C. The enhancement in Tm indicated the intercalation between DNA and S-15.62 The binding between S-15 and DNA was further confirmed through the electrochemical
method. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of S-15 (10 μM)
has one irreversible peak at −0.77 V, and the addition of DNA
to S-15 solution did not produce any new peak (Figure 6A). However, the
intensity of current was increased at −0.77 V, which indicates
the interaction between S-15 and DNA molecule.62−64

(B) CD spectra of DNA (50 μM) at different (ri = S-15/DNA) ratios of S-15 and DNA.

Furthermore, to investigate the
conformational changes in DNA upon
binding with S-15, CD spectra were recorded for different
ratios of S-15 and DNA. As indicated in Figure 6B, salmon sperm DNA has two
bands in the CD spectra. The positive band at ∼275 nm indicates
base stacking, and the negative band at ∼245 nm corresponds
to helicity.65 The addition of S-15 enhanced the intensity of the band at 275 nm, and further addition
of S-15 did not cause any change in intensity. However,
the band at 245 nm remained unchanged. The increase in intensity of
base stacking band indicated the intercalation mode of binding between S-15 and DNA.66 These spectroscopic
results indicated dual mode of interaction, electrostatic and intercalation,
between S-15 and DNA. The planar nature of hydrophobic
core helps to probe to intercalate into the non-polar interior of
the DNA helix.21 Moreover, amine groups
in S-15 have a positive charge at physiological environment
and are expected to facilitate H-bonding with the base and backbone
of DNA.23 To probe the interference from
other biologically relevant analytes, fluorescence spectra of S-15 were recorded with different biomolecules, and it was
noticed that none of the analyte showed particular change in the emission
profile of S-15 (see Supporting Information, Figure S19).

The cellular uptake of S-15 was
investigated by exposing
freshly cultivated L. pneumophila to
a 30 μM solution of S-15 in DMSO/H2O
(4:6, v/v) solvent system. Bacteria were incubated with S-15 for 1 h. This was followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 3000
rpm. The supernatant liquid was removed and the pellet was re-suspended
in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The dye-treated bacteria were immobilized
specifically on the surface of a GaAs(001) chip functionalized with
a self-assembled monolayer architecture comprising biotinylated-polyethylene-glycol
(PEG) and hexadecane thiols/neutravidin/biotinylated-antibody, as
illustrated in Figure 7. Previously, we employed a similar architecture for the immobilization
of Escherichia coli on GaAs,67 studying reaction of E. coli to antibiotics68 and for rapid detection
of L. pneumophila.69

Figure 7 Pictorial view of a GaAs(001) biochip functionalized with a biotinylated-PEG/neutravidin/biotinylated
antibody mixed with HDT architecture.

Following the 1 h exposure of a biochip to a PBS solution
with
dye-treated bacteria at 4 × 105 CFU/mL, it was washed
with PBS three times to remove the loosely bound bacteria. The presence
of bacteria on the surface of the biochip was analyzed using fluorescence
microscopy (excitation and emission at 457–487 and 502–538
nm, respectively). As shown in Figure 8A, bacteria showed a significant fluorescence that
remained stable over the extended period of time (∼1 h). The
analysis of surface coverage using ImageJ software revealed 25 ±
1.5 bacteria per mm2 immobilized from a 4 × 105 CFU/mL solution.

GaAs biochips exposed
to: (A) live L. pneumophila treated
with S-15 (30 μM) scale 5 μm, (B) S-15 only, (C) untreated L. pneumophila, (D) heat-killed L. pneumophila treated
with S-15 (30 μM), (E) confocal image of rhodamine-red
stained L. pneumophila, (F) confocal
image of S-15 stained L. pneumophila, and (G) the merged image of (E,F).

For comparison, two blank GaAs samples were prepared with
the architecture,
as presented in Figure 7. The first one was exposed to a 30 μM S-15 solution
free of bacteria, and the second to a bacteria solution at 4 ×
105 CFU/mL without the S-15 dye. The inability
to observe fluorescence in the blank samples (Figure 8B,C) irradiated under same conditions indicated
that the S-15 did not bind or precipitate on the surface
of functionalized GaAs chip and fluorescence was observed only when
the bacteria were treated with S-15 prior to incubation
with the functionalized GaAs chip. To investigate further, we employed
UV-treated L. pneumophila that was
obtained by exposing a bacterial solution to a mercury lamp emitting
at ∼254 nm for 5 min at room temperature, followed by incubation
with S-15 (30 μM). The absence of fluorescence
in this case suggests that dye neither internalize nor bind on the
surface of UV killed bacteria.

To understand the mode of penetration
(active or passive) of S-15 dye in the bacteria, the
biofunctionalized biochip was
exposed to L. pneumophila (4 ×
105 CFU/mL) heat killed at 90 °C for 20 min, followed
by incubation with the dye (S-15). The heat-killed bacteria
showed fluorescence (Figure 8D), which is possible only when the dye internalized into
bacteria. The heating process significantly influences the cell permeability,
and a long exposure to heat can result in cell leakage.70 Therefore, the change in membrane permeability
allows the dye to enter the bacteria that become fluorescent (Figure 8D). The analysis
of surface coverage using ImageJ software revealed 17 ± 3 bacteria
per mm2 immobilized on the biochip surface. Thus, the above
experiment indicated that fluorescence was observed only when the
dye (S-15) was internalized into the bacteria.

The internalization of S-15 was further investigated
by confocal microscopy. The fully functionalized GaAs chip was incubated
with 4 × 105 CFU/mL of L. pneumophila. To stain the bacterial membrane, the biochip was exposed to rhodamine-red
solution for 30 min. Next, the biochip was rinsed with 0.1× PBS
three times to remove unbound rhodamine-red dye. The biochip was further
incubated with the solution of S-15 (30 μM) for
1 h. After washing with deionized (DI) water and drying, the biochip
was placed in contact with a glass slide covered by an oil drop and
incubated for 24 h. To image the rhodamine staining, the biochip was
irradiated with excitation wavelength at 573 nm and emission was collected
at 591 nm. The resulting image shown in Figure 8E indicated the staining of bacterial membrane,
as evidenced by the red color emission, whereas no emission was observed
from the core of bacteria. To observe the emission from S-15 dye, the sample was excited at 450 nm and emission was observed
at 530 nm. The continuous rod-shaped green emission was detected in
this case, which indicates the internalization of S-15 dye (Figure 8F).
The merged image depicted the red emission observed from bacterial
membrane and the green emission from inside of the bacteria (Figure 8G). Thus, as our
spectroscopic studies show, S-15 intercalates with DNA,
which results in a significant change of its photophysical properties.

To investigate the effect of DMSO, optical images of L. pneumophila were recorded in 40% DMSO and compared
with control in PBS solution. The image analysis showed that the size
and shape of bacteria remained comparable in both environments (see Supporting Information, Figure S20). The cytotoxicity
of S-15 was also investigated toward the HeLa cell line
in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay. The dose-dependent studies (see Supporting Information, Figure S21) revealed that 90–97% cell remained
viable following the exposure up to 50 μM concentration of S-15. This suggests that the synthesized intercalator could
find applications in studying reactions involving DNA binding, nuclear
imaging, and cancerous cell research.

Conclusions
3-Amino-4-bromo-1,8-naphthalimide-based
DNA intercalator (S-15) has been synthesized with two
amine groups that provide
positive charge at physiological pH. This positively charged moiety
interacts with the bases and backbone of DNA (negatively charged)
through the electrostatic interactions and H-bonding. Moreover, the
planar hydrophobic naphthalimide ring of S-15 intercalates
with DNA. The complexation between DNA and S-15 has been
confirmed through UV–visible spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy,
cyclic voltammetry, 1H NMR titration, and CD spectroscopy.
The successive addition of DNA into the solution of S-15 decreases the absorbance at 342 and 413 nm. However, the titration
on fluorescence spectrophotometer showed a ratiometric change in the
emission profile of S-15. CD spectra of salmon sperm
DNA showed an increase in the ellipticity of the band at 275 nm in
the presence of S-15, and ΔTm was found increased by 7.0 °C compared to native DNA.
Thus, these spectroscopic observations indicate intercalation as well
as electrostatic interaction between S-15 and DNA. Furthermore,
the application of S-15 has been demonstrated for successful
staining and imaging of live L. pneumophila immobilized on the biofunctionalized surface of GaAs biochips.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 with tetramethylsilane (TMS)
as an internal reference. The NMR study was performed on a JNM-ECS400
(JEOL) instrument operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100
MHz for 13C NMR. The chemical shift (δ) values were
reported in parts per million relative to TMS, and splitting patterns
were conceptualized as s (singlet), bs (broad singlet), d (doublet),
dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet), and m (multiplet). All absorption
spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2400 spectrophotometer, and
emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LSS fluorescence spectrophotometer.
To ensure the uniformity, solutions were shaken well prior to measurements.
Electrochemical studies were recorded on a potentiostat–galvanostat
BASi Epsilon. Each measurement was recorded in a single compartment
cell equipped with a glass carbon working electrode, Pt wire counter
electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The working
electrode was cleaned through ultrasonication in ethanol and DI water.
The size distribution of nanoaggregates was determined on a Metrohm
Microtrac Ultra Nanotrac particle size analyzer (DLS). The DLS probe
equipped with a laser diode allows to rapidly detect the size distribution
of aggregates. The probe was carefully cleaned before measurements
and dipped into the solution. CD spectra were measured on a JASCO,
J-1500 CD spectrophotometer in the range between 220 and 400 nm. An
Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope was used to record the fluorescence
images. The confocal images have been recorded using Olympus FV3000
microscope. The raw images were captured using a Plan Apochromat 63×/1.40
objective.

Synthesis of S-12
Compound 1 was synthesized according to the procedure reported in the
literature.71 243 mg (1 mmol) of compound 1 was
dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol and 3 mmol of hydrazine hydrate was added
into it. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h, and yellow precipitates
were collected after filtration. Precipitates were washed with ethanol
(10 mL) three times and dried under vacuum. The yield was 65%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ

Synthesis of S-13 and S-21
They
were synthesized according to literature reports with little
modification.72 To the ethanolic solution
of 1 (243 mg, 1 mmol), respective amine (1.4 mmol) was

Synthesis of 2
Compound 2 was synthesized according to the
procedure reported in the literature
with little modification.73 In aqueous
solution of KOH (2 g in 15 mL water), 1 g of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride
was added and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After 30 min,
bromine water was added to the mixture over 3 h dropwise with vigorous
stirring and heated at 65 °C for 10 h. After 10 h, concentrated
HCl was added to obtain a brown precipitate. The obtained precipitates
were further treated with NaOH and filtered. The filtrate was again
acidified with HCl to get brown precipitates. The obtained precipitates
were dried under vacuum.

Synthesis of 3
400
mg (1.45 mmol) of 2 was dissolved in 2 mL of H2SO4 at
0 °C. 0.5 mL of HNO3 in 0.5 mL H2SO4 was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 0 °C and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h at 5 °C. After 6 h,
the reaction mixture was poured over ice to get yellow-colored precipitates.
The obtained precipitates were filtered out and washed with cold acetonitrile.
The yellow-colored precipitates were dried under vacuum to get pure
a pale yellow-colored compound 3. Yield: 65%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.89
(s, 1H), 8.80 (dd, J = 8.6, 1.0 Hz, 1H), 8.71 (dd, J = 7.3, 1.0 Hz, 1H), 8.15 (dd, J = 8.6,
7.3 Hz, 1H).

Synthesis of 4
2 g
(6.25 mmol) of compound 3 was dissolved in 2 mL of concentrated
hydrochloric acid,
and 15 g of tin chloride in 3 mL of hydrochloric acid was added dropwise.
After 2 h of reflux, precipitates were filtered off and washed with
water and ethanol followed by diethyl ether. The obtained yellow-colored
product was dried under vacuum to get compound 4 and
used in further reaction without any characterization.

Synthesis of S-15
0.342 mmol (100 mg)
of compound 4 was dissolved in 2 mL of absolute ethanol.
To the ethanolic solution, 1.56 mmol (50 mg) of hydrazine hydrates
was added dropwise and the solution was refluxed for 3 h. After 3
h, the solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. Yellow-colored
precipitates were washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum to get
pure compound S-15. Yield: 72%. 1H NMR (400
MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.21 (d, J = 9.4 Hz, 1H), 8.15 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H),
8.10 (s, 1H), 7.79–7.70 (m, 1H), 6.31 (s, 2H), 5.71 (s, 2H); 13C NMR (101 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ
161.03, 160.70, 145.95, 132.14, 130.61, 129.08, 126.50, 122.51, 122.37,
122.24, 120.46, 107.30. HRMS (SI, m/z) for [C12H8BrN3O2 +
H]+: calcd, 305.9800; found 305.9866.

Spectroscopic
Studies
All solutions were prepared at
room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). The solutions were mixed properly
before recording any measurements. The DNA-binding studies of S-15 were performed in DMSO/H2O (4:6, v/v) solution.
The titration was performed in a volumetric flask and DNA was added
stepwise. The fluorescence spectra of S-15 were recorded
with excitation wavelength at 430 nm; the excitation and emission
slit width was 10 nm.

Staining and Fluorescence Imaging
For cell-imaging
studies, a fresh culture of L. pneumophila ssp1 was grown on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar medium.
Bacterial colonies were transferred into a PBS solution. In order
to remove culture medium traces, the prepared bacteria suspension
was centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 rpm. This produced a pellet of
bacteria at the bottom of an Eppendorf tube with discarder supernatant
liquid. The pellet was than suspended in PBS. The concentration of
bacteria was determined by optical density (OD) measurements (0.1
OD600nm corresponds to 8 × 107L. pneumophila/mL). For the present study, 4 ×
105 CFU/mL concentration of L. pneumophila was used. The stock solution of S-15 (30 μM)
was prepared in DMSO/H2O (4:6, v/v). Bacteria were incubated
with S-15 for 1 h. It was followed by centrifugation
for 30 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant liquid was removed and the
pellet was re-suspended in PBS.

The heat-killed L. pneumophila was prepared by incubating a suspension
of live L. pneumophila at 2 ×
107 CFU/mL at 90 °C for 20 min. 4 × 105 heat-killed Legionella/mL were than
incubated with the S-15 dye for 1 h. It was followed
by centrifugation for 30 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant liquid was
removed and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS. The heat-killed process
efficiency was confirmed by growth test on l-cysteine BCYE
agar.

Substrate for Legionella Immobilization
GaAs(001) samples were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with OptiClear,
acetone, and isopropanol sequentially for 5 min each. Following the
cleaning steps, the samples were dried under a flow of compressed
nitrogen and etched in a solution of NH4OH (28%) for 2
min at room temperature. Freshly etched GaAs samples were rinsed with
deoxygenated anhydrous ethanol and immediately incubated for 20 h
at room temperature in a 2 mM mixture of b-PEG (1:15) and HDT (14:15)
thiols diluted in deoxygenated anhydrous ethanol. After the thiolation
step, the GaAs samples were rinsed with deoxygenated anhydrous ethanol
and dried. Following this step, the samples were incubated for 2 h
at room temperature in PBS (1×) solution containing 200 μg/mL
of neutravidin. Thereafter, the neutravidin-coated samples were immersed
for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of biotinylated polyclonal
antibodies against L. pneumophila diluted
in PBS (1×) at 0.1 mg/mL.

Cell Counting
The ImageJ software (NIH free software)
was employed for cell counting. Each data set is the average of three
independent experiments.
