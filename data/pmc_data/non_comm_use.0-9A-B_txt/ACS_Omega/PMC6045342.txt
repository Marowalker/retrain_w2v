In this article, a simple protocol
to prepare water-soluble fluorescent
copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) using trypsin as a stabilizer and hydrazine
hydrate as a reducing agent was reported. It was found that the pH
of the reaction solution was critical in determining the fluorescence
of CuNCs. CuNCs with blue and yellow fluorescent emission were obtained
under basic and acidic conditions, respectively. Although the detailed
formation mechanisms of these CuNCs required further analysis, the
synthetic route was promising for preparing different fluorescent
metal NCs for applications. With good water solubility and excellent
photostability, the yellow-emitting CuNCs could serve as a fluorescence
probe for detection of Hg2+ based on the aggregation-induced
quenching mechanism. The fluorescence quenching efficiency had fantastic
linearity to Hg2+ concentrations in the range of 0.1–100
μM, with a limit of detection of 30 nM. Additionally, the yellow-emitting
CuNCs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and were successfully applied
to bioimaging of HeLa cells.

Introduction
Metal nanoclusters
(MNCs), consisted of several to hundreds of
metal atoms, have drawn considerable attention due to their unique
physical, chemical, and optical properties resulting from their discrete
energy levels and band-gap energy structures.1,2 In
particular, compared with conventional organic fluorophores and semiconductor
quantum dots, fluorescent MNCs exhibit several advantages such as
strong photoluminescence, good biocompatibility, excellent photostability,
and sub-nanometer size.3 Thus, they have
been developed to be used in a wide range of applications in sensing4,5 and imaging.6,7

Among the studied MNCs,
gold NCs (AuNCs) and silver NCs (AgNCs)
have received extensive research attention by size-controlled synthesis,
structural characterization, and property investigations. In fact,
compared with gold and silver, copper was more popular in industry
because of its high conductivity and much lower cost. Nevertheless,
over the past decades, studies on the synthesis, properties, and applications
of copper NCs (CuNCs) were scarce primarily because of their susceptibility
to oxidation and the difficulty in preparing extremely tiny particles.8 In recent years, considerable efforts have been
devoted to exploring the synthesis of fluorescent CuNCs and great
progress has been achieved. By employing a series of scaffolds or
capping agents, such as small molecules,9 polymers,10 oligonucleotides,11 peptides,12 and proteins,13 stable CuNCs have been successfully prepared.
Among these methods, protein-templated synthesis is particularly attractive
as proteins could serve as environmentally benign reducing and stabilizing
molecules. However, there were few reports on the discussion of the
mechanism for the formation of CuNCs and it remained unclear how the
protein template affected the CuNC fluorescence behaviors under various
reaction conditions. In a previous report, the pH-dependent synthesis
of pepsin–AuNCs with different fluorescent emission was developed.
The different charges on pepsin under different pH conditions affected
the structure of pepsin chains, which led to the formation of AuNCs
with different fluorescent emission.14 Therefore,
it enlightened us whether multicolored CuNCs could be prepared by
regulating the reaction pH.

Hg2+ is one of the most
toxic heavy-metal ion pollutants
that exists in water, soil, and food. Mercury can accumulate in organisms
and has long-term adverse effects on liver, kidney, central nervous
system, and so on. Therefore, developing effective methods for the
sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ was especially
important for environmental monitoring and clinical research. Traditional
methods of Hg2+ sensing, including atomic absorption/emission
spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, stripping
voltammetry, etc.15−18 were limited by the disadvantages of requiring expensive instruments,
the complex procedures in sample preparation, a specific worker, etc.
Electrochemical, colorimetric, and fluorescent sensors for Hg2+ have also been reported over the past decade.19−29 Among these methods, fluorescent Hg2+ sensors based on
various nanoparticles have been developed due to their unique advantages
such as high sensitivity, simple operation, and fast response.30−33

On the basis of the above conditions, we reported for the
first
time a pH-dependent synthesis of CuNCs with blue and yellow fluorescent
emission using trypsin as a template and hydrazine hydrate as a reducing
agent (Scheme 1). Trypsin
is an important digestive enzyme produced by pancreatic acinar cells.34 It is also a good candidate for synthesis of
trypsin-stabilized CuNCs as trypsin is rich in amino acid residues,
with 7 cysteine (Cys) and 10 tyrosine (Tyr) residues. The different
conformational states of the trypsin molecule under different pH conditions
could affect the interaction between trypsin and copper ion surface,
leading to the formation of CuNCs with different sizes at different
pH conditions. Then, the prepared yellow-emitting CuNCs were successfully
employed as an effective fluorescent probe for Hg2+ sensing.
Because of the low toxicity and good biocompatibility of the yellow-emitting
CuNCs, they were also used in cell labeling of HeLa cells.

of the Synthesis of CuNCs with Blue and Yellow Emission
Results and Discussion
Trypsin contained rich Cys, His, and Tyr that could act as chelating
groups for sequestering copper ions and polyvalent ligands for passivating
the surface of metallic materials.35 Next,
the reducing agent N2H4 was applied to quickly
reduce Cu2+ cations to CuNCs. It has been reported that
proteins exhibit different conformational states at different pH levels,
which could affect the size and fluorescence properties of MNCs.14 Therefore, it was of interest to investigate
the synthesis of trypsin-templated CuNCs at different pH values. In
a typical synthesis, trypsin and CuSO4 solution was mixed
thoroughly. For the synthesis of yellow- and blue-emitting CuNCs,
the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3.4 and 12.0, respectively,
before addition of N2H4. It was worth noting
that after addition of N2H4 to the mixture,
the solution pH changed from 3.4 to 5.1 for the yellow-emitting CuNCs
and remained unchanged for the blue-emitting CuNCs. After incubating
at 70 °C for 2 h, CuNCs with different fluorescent emission were
obtained. Figure 1 shows
the maximum fluorescence excitation and emission peaks of the prepared
CuNCs. The diluted yellow- and blue-emitting CuNC solutions were nearly
colorless (or very pale yellow) and transparent under visible light,
whereas they exhibited yellow and blue fluorescence under UV light
irradiation (365 nm), respectively (inset of Figure 1). As shown in Figure S1A, the emission wavelength of blue-emitting CuNCs was red-shifted
from 415 to 475 nm with the excitation wavelength ranging from 310
to 400 nm, whereas the emission wavelength was almost independent
of the excitation wavelength for the yellow-emitting CuNCs (Figure S1B). The difference of the fluorescence
behaviors may be caused by the different surface states of the CuNCs
with blue and yellow emission. The absolute quantum yields (QYs) for
the CuNCs in aqueous solutions were measured as 3.1 and 0.1% for yellow
and blue emission, respectively. The morphology and size of CuNCs
were clearly revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Figure 2 shows that CuNCs
were highly uniform and monodisperse. The average diameters of CuNCs
for blue and yellow emission were about 1.8 and 2.5 nm, respectively.
These results were highly in accord with the phenomenon of fluorescence
wavelength dependence on the size of CuNCs. That is, the larger size
of CuNCs corresponded to the red-shifted fluorescence emission wavelength,
similar to that for other fluorescent nanostructures such as AuNCs.36Figure S2 shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared CuNCs and trypsin.
The absorption spectrum of trypsin had a peak centered at 276 nm,
and it was changed when CuNCs were formed. The rather broad spectra
with a small red-shifted hump confirmed the formation of CuNCs. Furthermore,
there was no apparent surface plasmon resonance absorption band appearing
at around 560–600 nm, indicating no large copper nanoparticles
in the CuNC samples.37,38 The slight blue shift of the
absorption for the blue-emitting CuNCs compared to that of the yellow-emitting
CuNCs further confirmed that the blue-emitting CuNCs were smaller
in size than that of the yellow-emitting CuNCs.39

and blue- (B) emitting CuNCs; insets show photographs of the CuNC
solution under visible (a, c) and UV (b, d) light irradiation.

In most reports, MNCs synthesized
with the assistance of proteins
were generally prepared under basic pH conditions.40−44 It was mainly because proteins possessed good reducing
capacity when the reaction pH was greater than pKa of Tyr (∼10)44 and
it could act as a reductant. However, in the present study, yellow-emitting
CuNCs were obtained when the synthesis was conducted at pH 3.4. Although
it was unclear how trypsin “biomineralized” fluorescent
CuNCs, the present results clearly showed that the pH of the reaction
solution played an important role in the determination of CuNCs with
yellow and blue fluorescent emission. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD)
spectra of the trypsin solution at different pH values were recorded
to investigate the mechanism of pH-dependent formation of multicolored
CuNCs. As shown in Figure 3, compared to that for the trypsin at pH 12.0, a negative
band at around 198 nm from the random coil became more predominant
for the trypsin at pH 3.4. It indicated that a large conformational
change for trypsin occurred because of the denaturation of trypsin
under acidic pH conditions. More functional groups, such as −OH,
−NH, and −COOH, could thus be accessible to interact
with copper, and large internal spaces within the weak-bonding random-coiled
trypsin may be utilized for the formation of large CuNCs. Accordingly,
it was concluded that different secondary structures of trypsin at
different pH levels could affect the formation of CuNCs with different
sizes. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra is an excellent
tool for the structural characterization of proteins in various environments.
It has been reported that the amide I band in the FT-IR spectrum was
also sensitive to the change of protein secondary structure.45Figure S3 revealed
that the characteristic vibration peaks of trypsin were unaltered
after the blue-emitting CuNCs formed, whereas an obvious shift of
the amide I band to lower wavenumbers was observed after the formation
of yellow-emitting CuNCs. This indicated that a conformational change
for the trypsin of yellow-emitting CuNCs occurred under acidic pH
conditions. Therefore, all of these results confirmed that the mechanism
for the formation of pH-dependent multicolored CuNCs was based on
the changes of the secondary structure of trypsin at different pH
levels.

In the present study, as the yellow-emitting
CuNCs possessed good
water solubility and strong fluorescence intensity, they could be
explored as a fluorescent probe for practical sensing. To improve
the sensitivity of the fluorescent probe, several experimental conditions
including the concentration, temperature, and reaction time were optimized
to obtain yellow-emitting CuNCs with high fluorescence intensity.
In this method, we found that N2H4 was necessary
in the preparation of CuNCs. As shown in Figure S4, in the preparation of yellow-emitting CuNCs, the product
synthesized in the absence of N2H4 exhibited
no fluorescence signal. From this phenomenon, it could be concluded
that trypsin alone was not enough to reduce Cu ions. N2H4 was deemed as a reducing agent. In addition to N2H4, several other reducing agents such as ascorbate
and NaBH4 were also applied for the synthesis of yellow-emitting
CuNCs. As shown in Figure S5, the CuNCs
with N2H4 as the reducing agent exhibited relatively
strong fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence spectra of the CuNCs
prepared with different molar ratios of CuSO4 and N2H4 (keeping the concentration of trypsin constant)
are shown in Figure S6A. It could be seen
that the product with a molar ratio of 1:1 exhibited the maximum fluorescence
intensity at 567 nm. The reaction temperature was also investigated
in the synthesis of fluorescent CuNCs. As shown in Figure S6B, external heat could significantly accelerate the
generation of CuNCs; thus, 70 °C was chosen as the reaction temperature.
Under these reaction conditions, the fluorescence intensity reached
maximum with the reaction time up to 2.0 h, and after that, it decreased
(Figure S6C). This result might be attributed
to the redistribution or interprotein transfer of copper ions after
2.0 h.46 Therefore, an optimum reaction
time of 2.0 h was used in the whole study. Therefore, the yellow-emitting
CuNCs prepared under optimal synthetic conditions were used for conducting
the following research.

It was well known that Cu was easily
oxidized because of its low
reduction potential. Therefore, it was important to confirm the oxidation
state of Cu in the CuNC sample. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey spectrum showed that the sample was composed of all of
the expected elements C, N, O, S, and Cu (Figure 4A). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the
Cu 2p peak of CuNCs is displayed in Figure 4B. Two intense peaks at 951.0 and 931.2 eV
were assigned to the binding energies of Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 from Cu(0), and the result was consistent with the previous
report.9,41 In addition, no characteristic satellite
peak at around 942 eV implied the absence of Cu2+ in CuNCs.
This thus precluded any significant oxidation of CuNCs.47 Nevertheless, it was known that the typical
2p3/2 binding energy of Cu(0) was only ∼0.1 eV away
from that of the Cu(I) species.8 Therefore,
the valence state of Cu in our samples likely lied between 0 and +1.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CuNCs showed a broad
peak at around 20° (Figure 4C). The result supported the absence of a significant
population of crystalline Cu nanoparticles in the sample.48 Next, the surface bonds of the synthesized CuNCs
were analyzed by FT-IR. As shown in Figure 4D, the peaks at 3400–3000 cm–1 due to −NH and −OH stretching vibrations were also
prominent in the spectra, indicating the existence of free −NH2/–COOH groups in CuNCs.

To test the feasibility of using the as-prepared CuNCs in
practical
sensing applications, the stability of the CuNC probe was investigated.
As shown in Figure S7, both the blue- and
yellow-emitting CuNCs were observed to be very stable that the fluorescence
intensity had no change under continuous light irradiation for 60
min. In addition, CuNCs displayed relatively stable fluorescence intensities
even under extreme pH conditions (Figure S8). From Figure S9, it could be noted that
the fluorescence intensity remained nearly constant when the concentration
of NaCl was as high as 50 mM. These results indicated that the as-prepared
CuNCs had excellent photostability and salt tolerance.

In this
work, it was observed that the fluorescence intensity of
the yellow-emitting CuNCs was sensitively quenched in the presence
of Hg2+. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, with the addition of different concentrations
of Hg2+, the fluorescence intensity of the CuNC solution
decreased proportionately. The fluorescence response was rapid, and
the reaction completely achieved a balance within 1 min (Figure S10). To achieve maximum quenching efficiency,
the type of buffer solution and detection pH value have been optimized.
As shown in Figure S11A, CuNCs exhibited
strongest fluorescence intensity in the pH 4.0 phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer solution compared to that in other buffer solutions.
In addition, with the addition of Hg2+ to the CuNC solution,
the fluorescence quenching efficiency reached maximum in the pH 4.0
PBS buffer solution (Figure S11B). Therefore,
the pH 4.0 PBS buffer solution was selected for detection of Hg2+. Under optimum conditions, the quenching efficiency (F0/F) displayed a good linear
relationship (R2 = 0.993) with the concentration
of Hg2+ ranging from 0.1 to 100 μM, where F0 and F are the fluorescence
intensities of the CuNC solution in the absence and presence of Hg2+, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) (3s/k, in which s is the standard
deviation for the control and k is the slope of the
calibration curve) was estimated to be 30 nM, which was lower or comparable
to that obtained by other fluorescent probes for Hg2+ sensing
(Table 1).49−52 It should be noted that the sensitivity of the CuNC sensor for Hg2+ was lower than that of DNA-templated fluorescence nanoclusters.53−55 Nevertheless, the proposed method in this work was much easy-going
and time-saving, which made it more convenient for practical applications.

Besides those of Hg2+, the effects of some other metal
ions and several amino acids on the assay system were further investigated
under the same test conditions. As shown in Figure 6, the fluorescence intensity of CuNCs decreased
significantly by adding Hg2+ to the solution, whereas other
metal ions (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) and several amino acids (Cys, Trp,
Pro, Tyr, His, Thr, Phe) had only a slight or negligible effect on
the fluorescence intensity, even when the concentration of the potential
interferences was 5-fold higher than that of Hg2+. It is
worth mentioning that other than Hg2+, Ag+ ions
also led to great decreases in the fluorescence intensity. To eliminate
the interference, a chelating ligand, sodium chloride (2.0 mM), which
showed effective masking ability for Ag+, was added to
the solution. As a result, even in the presence of Ag+ at
a concentration 5 times greater than that of Hg2+, no obvious
fluorescence quenching was observed, thus exhibiting improved selectivity
of the CuNC probe toward Hg2+. The results demonstrated
that the fluorescent CuNC probe exhibited excellent selectivity toward
Hg2+.

Figure 6 Selectivity of the CuNC sensor toward Hg2+ over
other
metal ions (A) and amino acids (B). The concentrations of Hg2+ and interfering substances were 100 and 500 μM, respectively.
The concentration of Cl– was 2 mM.

To date, several Hg2+-induced fluorescence
quenching
mechanisms have been proposed. Morishita et al. noticed a significant
quenching of AgNCs by Hg2+, and they attributed it to the
redox reaction mechanism.56 In our present
work, the oxidation state of Cu in CuNCs was investigated by the XPS
spectra in the absence and presence of 100 μM Hg2+, respectively. As shown in Figure S12, the addition of Hg2+ to the CuNC solution had little
effect on the oxidation state of Cu, which ruled out the redox-reaction-induced
CuNC fluorescence quenching. Other fluorescence quenching mechanisms
could be taken into consideration. To study the Hg2+-induced
fluorescence quenching mechanism, the TEM image of CuNCs after addition
of Hg2+ was investigated (Figure 7A). It was clear that CuNCs obviously aggregated
after Hg2+ was added. As it was reported, Hg2+ has a strong affinity toward amino and carboxylic groups on the
surface of CuNCs.57,58 The interaction between Hg2+ and CuNCs made the CuNCs close to each other. Thus, fluorescence
quenching of CuNCs was ascribed to the aggregation of CuNCs induced
by Hg2+, thus facilitating the efficient energy transfer.
The phenomenon was consistent with the previous report by Huang.59 In addition, the fact that quenching by Hg2+ did not affect markedly either the fluorescence emission
spectrum or the absorption spectrum of CuNCs (Figure 7B) further indicated the quenching mechanism
of energy transfer between CuNCs and Hg2+.60

spectra of CuNCs before and after addition of different concentrations
of Hg2+.

The practical application
of this fluorescence method was evaluated
through the detection of Hg2+ in human urine and serum
samples. Three concentrations of Hg2+ were spiked into
the samples. The recovery values were in the range of 89.0–105.0
and 95.0–108.8% in urine and serum samples, respectively (Table 2). These results demonstrated
that the current strategy for Hg2+ sensing in practical
samples was reliable and feasible.

To apply the yellow-emitting CuNCs
in the field of biological imaging,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assays were carried out to assess the cytotoxicity of the CuNC probes
to HeLa cells. HeLa cells were incubated with various concentrations
of CuNCs in standard cell culture conditions. After incubation for
24 h, the viability of the cells was determined. As shown in Figure 8, the cell viability
was found to be greater than 82% even when the concentration of CuNCs
was up to 500 μg/mL. High cell viability demonstrated the low
toxicity and excellent biocompatibility of the as-prepared CuNCs,
which made them suitable for cell imaging.

cells in the presence of different concentrations
of CuNCs.

As shown in Figure 9, by incubating Hela cells with CuNCs (500
μg/mL) for 1 h at
37 °C, a significant yellow emission from the intracellular region
could be observed. All of these results showed that the yellow-emitting
CuNCs could be applied in the field of biological imaging and cell
labeling.

Conclusions
In summary, CuNCs with yellow and blue fluorescent
emission were
synthesized with a facile approach in the presence of trypsin and
N2H4. The pH of the reaction solution was critical
in determining whether CuNCs showed yellow or blue fluorescent emission.
As the yellow-emitting CuNCs exhibited excellent stability, low toxicity,
and good biocompatibility, the fluorescent CuNCs were successfully
used in not only the detection of Hg2+ but also cell imaging
in HeLa cells. Therefore, this facile preparation of multicolored
CuNCs offered access to promising candidates for biological labeling
and sensing applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Trypsin
from bovine pancreas was obtained
from Aladdin Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). CuSO4·5H2O was purchased from Shanghai Bodi Chemical Co., Ltd (Shanghai,
China). HgCl2, KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2,
MnCl2, CoCl2, BaCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, and AlCl3 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

pH-Dependent Synthesis of Copper Nanoclusters (CuNCs)
All
glassware was cleaned in a bath of freshly prepared 3:1 HCl/HNO3 and rinsed thoroughly in water before use. Yellow-emitting
CuNCs were prepared as follows. Typically, 1 mL of CuSO4 solution (10 mM) was added to 1 mL of trypsin (40 mg/mL) under vigorous
stirring at room temperature. Five minutes later, the pH of the obtained
solution was about 3.4. Then, 100 μL of N2H4 solution (100 mM) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 70 °C in a water bath for 2
h, and the color changed gradually from light blue to pale yellow.
After the reaction, CuNCs were purified by centrifuging at 12 000
rpm to remove large particles. The resultant yellow-emitting CuNCs
were stored at 4 °C for further use.

To obtain the blue-emitting
CuNCs, similar synthesis was conducted except that the pH of the solution
before addition of N2H4 was adjusted to 12 by
1 M NaOH. The final dark brown solution of CuNCs exhibited a blue-emitting
fluorescence under UV lamp irradiation.

Fluorescence Detection
of Hg2+
For the typical
assay of Hg2+, 300 μL of the prepared yellow-emitting
CuNCs solution was added into 2.2 mL of the PBS buffer solution (pH
4.0, 10.0 mM) to prepare the probe solution. The solution (10.0 μL)
with different concentrations of Hg2+ was added into the
probe solution. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected with
excitation at 360 nm after 60 s. In the selectivity experiment, a
series of potential metal ions and amino acids were mixed with the
probe solution. The concentrations of the these interferences were
500 μM.

Characterization
All of the instruments
used for characterization
were the same as those used in the previous work.10,61 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CuNCs with different
fluorescent emission were obtained using a Tecnai G2F30 instrument.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet
Nexus 670 spectrometer using KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/max 82400 X-ray powder diffractometer
(Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 Å).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed using
a PerkinElmer PHI-5702 multifunctional photoelectron spectrometer
equipped with an Al Kα exciting source. Far-UV circular dichroism
(CD) spectra of trypsin under different pH conditions were recorded
at 25 °C on an Olis DSM 1000 double-beam spectrophotometer. UV–visible
absorption spectra were recorded by a TU-1901 double-beam UV–vis
spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using
a RF-5301 spectrofluorophotometer with both excitation and emission
slits set at 10.0 nm. The excitation wavelength was set at 360 nm.
Samples for absorption and emission measurements were taken in 1 cm
× 1 cm quartz cuvette. The absolute photoluminescence quantum
yield (QY) of CuNCs was measured and calculated using an “Edinburgh
Instruments” FLS 920 spectrometer, which has been reported
by our previous work (see Supporting Information).10

MTT Assay
The
human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
using a 96-well culture plate and kept in an incubator at 37 °C
with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Prior to test,
1 × 104 cells were incubated in 96-well plates for
24 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μL. Then, 10 μL
of CuNCs with different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, and
500 μg/mL, respectively) was added and incubated for another
24 h. Afterward, cells were rinsed twice with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4)
followed by addition of 100 μL of fresh medium and 10 μL
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
(5 mg/mL) to each well. The cells were incubated for additional 4
h at 37 °C. After removing all medium from the wells, 100 μL
of dimethylsulfoxide was added to each well and mixed thoroughly for
5 min. The optical density (OD) of the mixture was measured at 570
nm using a microplate reader. The cell viability was estimated as
(OD treated/OD control) × 100%, where OD control and OD treated
were obtained in the absence and presence of CuNCs, respectively.62

°C with 5% CO2 overnight. Then, CuNCs (500 μg/mL)
were added to the cell culture, and the cells were incubated for another
1 h at 37 °C. After the cells were washed with PBS three times,
the fluorescence images were acquired by a fluorescent microscope.
