The ideal product of rare-earth-doped
phosphors should have uniform
particle size distribution and homogeneous doping ions in each particle,
and therefore, intensified micromixing at mesoscale is highly required.
In this article, inspired by the concept of “mesoscience”,
we demonstrate the tuning of Eu3+ doping in GdBO3 microparticles at mesoscale by a high-gravity-assisted reactive
precipitation-coupled calcination process. The high-gravity environment
and tiny droplets generated by the high-gravity rotating packed bed
(RPB) reactor lead to significant intensification of mass transfer
and micromixing, which are beneficial for the homogeneous doping of
Eu3+ in the host material during reactive precipitation
in liquid solution. Under excitation at 395 nm, the emission spectra
of the Eu3+-doped phosphors exhibit a narrow-band red emission
centered at 625 nm and the highest intensity was observed at x = 0.2. The RPB products show higher intensity than that
of the control group even when the reaction time was shortened to
1/6. After calculation, the quenching in the sample most likely results
from dipole–dipole interactions. The chromaticity coordinates
for the RPB sample was measured as (0.598, 0.341) with a quantum yield
of up to 78.11%, and the phosphors exhibit good thermal stability
at 423 K. The phosphors were used as the luminescent materials for
light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and the devices showed good performance.
Our preliminary study illustrated that high-gravity-assisted approaches
are promising for tuning the doping of rare-earth ions in microparticles
at mesoscale toward efficient production of phosphors for LEDs.

Introduction
The rare-earth-doped
luminescent nanoparticles and microparticles
have found many applications, and the rare-earth ions with emission
in every color are revolutionizing applications from lighting devices
to television displays.1−5 For instance, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on the use of rare-earth-doped
phosphors have been widely recognized as a green lighting source in
favor of energy saving and environment protection.6−9 In such a module, phosphors play
crucial roles in determining the performance and quality of LEDs and
the fast development of LED raises the demand of phosphors with uniform
size distribution, high luminescence quantum efficiency, and high
thermal stability.10 Typically, the phosphors
are made up of host materials and activators, while their optical
properties are extremely sensitive
to their structures in mesoscale.11−14 The host materials include nitrogen/oxide,15 aluminate,16,17 silicate,18 borate,19 and fluorides.20 The activators are usually rare-earth ions that
can absorb high-energy photons and emit low-energy photons. The ideal
product of rare-earth-doped phosphors should have a uniform particle
size distribution and homogeneous doping ions in each particle, while
in common situation the products are unevenly distributed either in
size or component (Figure 1). Previous studies show that the general process of the rare-earth-doped
particle formation involves the mixing of the reactants, precipitation
of the precursors, and high-temperature heat treatment of crystals.21−23 The formation of primary particles in solution is usually the result
of relative diffusion of solutes, and the main factor is the difference
of diffusion concentration.24 It is feasible
to control and tune the characteristics of rare-earth-doped phosphors
in lab-scale synthesis. However, it is very difficult to reproduce
for scale-up due to the possible changes in reaction kinetics and
thermodynamics.25 To bridge the gap between
the real products and ideal products of rare-earth-doped phosphors,
tuning of the doping of rare-earth ions in nanoparticles and/or microparticles
at mesoscale is therefore highly required.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the ideal product and common situation of
ion-doped inorganic nano/microparticles.

In this work, we demonstrate the tuning of Eu3+ doping
in GdBO3 microphosphors by a high-gravity-assisted reactive
precipitation-coupled calcination process. A high-gravity rotating
packed bed (RPB) reactor was used as the reactor for the reactive
precipitation of precursor of GdBO3:Eu3+, followed
by annealing to obtain microphosphors. The crystal structures, morphologies,
and element distributions of GdBO3:Eu3+ microparticles
were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic
microscopy (SEM). The optical properties including luminescence spectra
and luminescence quantum yields under excitation of near-ultraviolet
(NUV) light were analyzed. The particles obtained by using conversional
stirred tank reactors (STR) were adopted for comparison study. The
LED devices fabricated by the GdBO3:Eu3+ microphosphors
and NUV chips showed bright red emission, promising for applications
in the next generation of semiconductor lighting.

Results and Discussion
Two types of reactors including conversional STR and RPB were used
for the mixing of the reactants for precipitation of the precursors
during the preparation of GdBO3:Eu3+ microparticles.
The mixture of the reactants was allowed to react at room temperature
in an STR or an RPB reactor for a certain time (in RPB for 10, 20,
30, 40, and 50 min, respectively, and in STR for 2 h). After that,
the precipitations were annealed at 1200 °C for 4 h under air
conditions to obtain particles with good crystallinity. The main chemical
reaction in the solution can be described as follows 1  Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of the products from the RPB route
by reacting in the RPB reactor for various times from 20 to 50 min.
It was noted that the reaction time did not have significant effects
on the crystal form of final products, which was attributed to the
combination of the fillers and the strong centrifugal force in the
RPB reactor. The liquid stream of the reactants is quickly cut into
smaller liquid films and droplets,26,27 allowing fast
mixing of the reaction molecules and completion of the reaction in
very short time.28Figure 2b shows the comparison of XRD patterns for
samples RPB-20min and STR-2h. Although the reaction time in RPB is
only 1/6 of that in STR, the two samples obtained from both RPB and
STR routes exhibited similar crystal structures, which are in good
agreement with the standard patterns of GdBO3 crystal (JCPDS
no. 74-1932). No significant impurity peaks were observed, indicating
that the Eu3+ ions were completely embedded into the GdBO3 host lattices without significant effect on the crystal structures
of the GdBO3 lattices. The XRD data were further analyzed
to calculate the unit cell parameters, which are shown in Tables S1 and S2. The cell parameters of the
RPB-20min product are significantly closer to the unit cell parameters
of the standard GdBO3 (a = b = 3.829, c = 8.89) than that of the STR-2h product.
These results were attributed to the enhanced mixing characteristics
of the RPB reactor, which made the doping ions distribute more uniformly
in the matrix lattices than those formed in conversional STR. The
doping ions of Eu3+ uniformly replace the Gd3+ in the matrix lattice and the doping ratio is relatively low (10
atom %) so that the doping of Eu3+ ions has no significant
effect on the formation of the host crystal form.

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns of the
products obtained via the RPB route by
reacting in the RPB reactor for various times from 20 to 50 min and
(b) XRD patterns of products obtained via the STR route by reacting
in the STR for 2 h, followed by annealing at 1200 °C for 4 h
under air conditions for all samples.

Figure 3 shows the
SEM images and elemental distributions of Eu and Gd in the GdBO3:Eu3+ particles before and after annealing. Both
samples exhibited a cylindrical shape before annealing, but the particles
by reaction in RPB reactors showed a more regular shape and smaller
size. The aspect ratio of the particles in the field of view is uniform
and the surface is smooth. After annealing of the precursor, the samples
obtained from RPB routes maintained their original particle sizes
(about 2 μm) without significant agglomeration. The organic
component disappears and the structure of cylinder changes. However,
the samples prepared by the conversional STR route exhibited relative
wide size distributions. The typical elemental mapping results, the
merged images of Gd mapping and Eu mapping in particularly, indicated
that the doping of Eu3+ ions in the GdBO3 matrix
was more uniformly dispersed in the samples of RPB (Figure 3a,c) than that in the samples
of STR (Figure 3b,d).
These results demonstrated that the use of the RPB reactor for mixing
of the reactants and precipitation of the precursors was beneficial
for tuning the doping of Eu3+ in GdBO3 microparticles
at mesoscale with a uniform distribution to form GdBO3 microparticles
with uniform size distribution and homogeneous doping ions.

by (c) RPB route and (d) STR route. The reaction times in the RPB
and STR were 2 h and 20 min, respectively.

In the excitation spectra of the samples shown in Figure 4a, several types of transition
are observed. The peaks at 314 and 320 nm were assigned to Gd3+ → Eu3+, 8S7/2 → 6P5/2, 8S7/2 → 6P7/2 energy transfer. The f → f transition 7F0 → 5L6 of Eu3+ was expressed as the peak around 395 nm, which was the most
intensive in the field of vision. The emission spectra (Figure 4b) are composed of 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 1–4) emission lines of Eu3+ and the peak at 592 nm is dominated by magnetic-dipole transition 5D0 → 7F1 of Eu3+, while the crystal field splits 5D0 → 7F2 electric-dipole transition into
two main lines at 610 and 625 nm. The emission lines located at 650
nm (5D0 → 7F3),
675 nm (5D0 → 7F4), and 691 nm (5D0 → 7F4) are also labeled in Figure 4b. It was noted that both spectra of the sample of
RPB were significantly better than those of sample STR-2h. The ratio
of red-to-orange emission intensities (R/O), I(5D0–7F2)/I(5D0–7F1), is
widely known as the asymmetric ratio.29 Low site symmetry host materials exert a crystal field containing
more odd components around rare-earth-doped ions and are more favorable
for luminescence of the ions than those in their high symmetry counterparts.
Therefore, on considering the sum of integral intensity of red emission
peaks at 611 and 625 nm for 5D0–7F2 and 590 nm for 5D0–7F1, Figure 4c was presented, which indicated that the R/O ratio of RPB-20min
(2.25) is higher than that of STR-2h (2.09). These results were attributed
to the slight decrease in local symmetry around Eu3+ ions.
In the decay spectra in Figure 4d, the red emission (5D0 → 7F2 transition) at 625 nm was determined by the
following double-exponential formula30,31 2  In the formula, I and I0 are the luminescence
intensities at times t and 0 s and A1 and A2 are their fitting
parameters. τ1 and τ2 indicate the corresponding
decay times for the exponential components, especially τ1 mainly determines the persisting performance of materials.
Sample’s defects might act as the channels of nonradiative
relaxation, determining that the decay curves are double-exponential.
The average
lifetimes were calculate to be 2.97 ms (STR) and 2.56 ms (RPB). As
demonstrated in a previous report,23 an
increase in the doping amount leads to a decrease in the decay time
due to the cross-relaxation phenomenon between the Eu3+ ions. As per the results shown in Figure 3, the use of the RPB reactor increases the
uniformity of doping. In other words, the use of the RPB reactor increased
the effective dopant density of Eu3+ in the particles.
Therefore, the fluorescence lifetime of the RPB sample was shorter
than that of STR.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Gd(1–x)BO3/xEu3+ (x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, and 0.4)
phosphor with different Eu3+ doping concentrations under
395 nm excitation are shown in Figure 5. To determine which type of interaction mechanism
dominates the energy transfer process among Eu3+ icons,
we use the following equation32 3  

Figure 5 (a)

where I is the emission intensity, X refers to the activator
concentration, and K and
β are constants under the same excitation condition for the
given host crystal. θ is a constant of multipolar interaction,
and θ = 6, 8, 10 denotes electric d–d, d–q, q–q
interactions, respectively. The relation between log(I/x) and log(x) is linear and the
slop is −0.70, indicating that the nonraditive energy transfer
mechanism among the Eu3+ ions in the host is the d–d
interaction. These results further demonstrated that the performance
of GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphors was closely related
to the mesoscale behavior and the uniform doping of Eu3+ in GdBO3 microparticles.

It is known that the luminescent
ions will reach the ground state
via thermal quenching. They can go to the ground state when the excited
state and the ground state energy curves cross at an energy that is
thermally accessible from the relaxed excited state. The nonradiative
rate, knr, can be expressed as33 4  where A is a constant, k is Boltzmann’s
constant (≈8.62 × 10–5), and Ea is the activation
energy for the thermal quenching process. The probability of nonradiative
transition increasing with temperature leads to a decrease of emission
intensity. Thermal quenching of the emission intensity of Eu3+ mainly accounts for the jumping of excited electrons into the charge-transfer
state band with absorbing thermal energy, as schematically shown in Figure 6a, a condition in
which the probability of nonradiative transition increases. Then,
the emission intensity of Eu3+-activated phosphor decreases.
It can be seen from Figure 6b that the luminescence intensity of the GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphors exhibited a slight increase as the temperature
increases in the range of room temperature to 340 K and then remained
steady in the range of 340–450 K, followed by a decrease over
450 K. This phenomenon was attributed to the following reason. The
rise of temperature accelerates the molecular thermal motion to a
certain extent to promote the photon radiation transition. However,
when the temperature reaches a certain value, the nonradiative transition
dominates, resulting in a decrease in the luminous intensity. I0 is used as a numerator in the formula because
the fluorescence intensity is the strongest at ambient temperature
by default. To ensure that I0/I
– 1 is a positive number, I0 was defined as the intensity of emission at 348 K. As expressed
by eq 4, a higher value
of Ea means a lower nonradiative rate
at a given temperature. In our experiments, the experimental data
can be linearly fitted with a slope of −0.26 (Figure 6c), suggesting that the activation
energy, Ea, was 0.26 eV. The small number
of Ea further confirmed the good thermal
stability of the Gd(1–x)BO3/xEu3+ phosphor. By comparing
with the phosphors reported,34−37 it can be seen that the phosphor synthesized
by our method excels in
both quantum efficiency and thermal stability (Table 1), which was attributed to the following
two reasons: First, the annealing treatment (1200 °C) is used
in the preparation process, which makes the particle structure more
tolerant to high temperatures. Second, since the radius of the B atom
is smaller, the interaction force between the B atom and O atom is
stronger and the bonding is more stable than that of other host materials,
which leads to good thermal stability. Energy transfer among the dopants
is the main reason for concentration quenching, which also greatly
affects the quantum yield. The critical distance is roughly estimated
by the following formula34 5  where RC is the
critical distance, V is the volume of the unite cell, Xc refers to the critical concentration, and N refers to the number of formula units per unit cell. For
this system, the short distance between Eu3+ ions will
lead to energy transfer between ions, increase the probability of
nonradiative transitions, and weaken the fluorescence performance,
similar to concentration quenching. When the distance between Eu3+ ions and Gd3+ ions is too long, the energy transfer
between two ions is hindered and the energy utilization rate is reduced.
The high-gravity RPB reactor can provide a homogeneous environment
for the growth of particles, effectively control the distance between
rare-earth ions, successfully avoid the above disadvantages, and therefore
improve the quantum yield.

Conclusions
Inspired by the
concept of “mesoscience”,38 we demonstrate a novel route toward efficient
production of red phosphors for LEDs. By a high-gravity-assisted process
intensification method to achieve uniform Eu3+ doping in
GdBO3 particles at mesoscale, the reaction time for the
preparation of
the precursor was reduced from 2 h in STR to 20 min in RPB. The product
of red phosphors with luminescence quantum yield of up to 78.11% was
obtained and makes one of the best red phosphors. The GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphors synthesized by high-gravity-assisted methods
also show excellent thermal stability at 423 K, maintaining 98% of
luminescent intensity at room temperature. The CIE chromaticity coordinates
of the as-synthesized GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphor were
determined to be (0.598, 0.341), and primary applications of these
phosphors for NUV LEDs were demonstrated. These studied illustrated
that high-gravity-assisted approaches are promising for tuning the
doping of rare-earth ions in microparticles at mesoscale toward efficient
production of phosphors.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gadolinium
oxide (Gd2O3, 99.9%), europium oxide (Eu2O3, 99.9%), boric
acid (H3BO3, >99.5%), and acetylacetone (C5H8O2, 99%) were bought from Aladdin
Industrial Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Nitric acid (HNO3, 65%), urea ((NH2)2CO, 99%), and ethanol (C2H5OH, 98%) were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Works (Beijing, China), and poly(ethylene glycol)-1000 (PEG, 99%)
was obtained from Bioruler Co. Ltd. All of the materials were used
without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Deionized water,
used for all processes, was prepared by the Hitech laboratory water
purification system DW100 (Shanghai Hitech Instruments Co., Ltd.).

Preparation of GdBO3:Eu3+ Phosphors
GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphors (mole ratio of Eu/Gd
= 1:9) were synthesized by a homogeneous precipitation-coupled calcination
method. The stoichiometric amounts of Gd2O3 (3.26
g), Eu2O3 (0.352 g), H3BO3 (1.428 g), nitric acid (2.84 g), and PEG (4.42 g) were weighed,
adding acetylacetone (4.32 mL) as the chelating agent, and mixed homogeneously
with 100 mL of deionized water in a reactor. The reaction was allowed
to be performed in conversional STR and RPB reactors, respectively.
Afterward, 36 g of urea was added to the mixture and vigorously stirred
at 90 °C for 1 h. The solid powder was separated by centrifugation
and washed four times using deionized water and ethanol. The powder
was dried at 80 °C for 5 h in an oven and then placed in a corundum
crucible and covered up. After annealing in a furnace at 1200 °C
for 5 h under an air atmosphere, the corundum crucible was naturally
cooled down to indoor temperature. The phosphors synthesized by STR
and RPB reactors are denoted STR-X and RPB-X, in which X represents the reaction time
of the reactants in the respective reactors (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 min,
and 2 h).

Fabrication of LED Devices
The near-UV chip and package
glue were commercial products obtained from Ningbo Sunpu Led Co.,
Ltd. and Beijing KMT Technology Co., Ltd., respectively. Briefly,
certain amounts of A glue (0.1 g), B glue (0.4 g), and GdBO3:Eu3+ phosphors (0.2 g) were mixed homogeneously. The
mixture was then dropped on the near-UV chips to cover the surface
of the chips completely. Afterward, the LED devices were heated at
150 °C for 4 h and then cooled to the room temperature for testing.

Characterization
The crystal structures and phase purities
were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku), with
data collected at a scanning speed of 5° min–1 and a scanning angle from 10 to 80°. The photoluminescence
(PL) spectra, photoluminescence excitation, fluorescence decay, quantum
yield, and CIE spectra of samples were measured using a spectrophotometer
(Edinburgh FS5) equipped with a 150 W continuous-wave Xeon lamp as
the excitation source. The temperature-dependent PL spectra and LED
test were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer (Yuanfangguangdian
HAAS-2000 with temperature-increasing accessories TAP-02, Orient-KOJI
Instrument Co. Ltd.). The particle morphology was characterized by
scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7800F).
