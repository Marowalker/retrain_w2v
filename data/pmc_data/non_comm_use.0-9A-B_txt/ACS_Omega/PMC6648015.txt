We prepared iodine
molecules encapsulated in single-walled carbon
nanotubes (I@SWCNTs) by electro-oxidation of iodide ions with empty
SWCNT electrode. Li-ion battery electrode properties of I@SWCNTs were
investigated. It was found that the I@SWCNT sample can catch and release
Li ions reversibly. We performed Raman measurements to reveal the
Li-ion storage mechanism of I@SWCNT. It is plausible that chemical
reactions of I2 from/into LiI in SWCNTs occur during Li-ion
charging/discharging of I@SWCNT. We also prepared the CsI@SWCNT sample
to verify that alkali metal ions can be extracted from alkali metal
halide in SWCNTs. The extraction of cesium ions from CsI@SWCNT was
confirmed by Raman measurements. It was also found that I@SWCNT can
work as a Li-ion battery electrode in solid electrolyte as well.

1 Introduction
Lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in portable
electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers, owing
to their high energy density.1,2 The last decade also
witnessed the use of LIBs for large machines (e.g., electric vehicles).
However, of course, LIBs have some problems to be solved to ensure
the wider spread of electric vehicles. One of the problems is safety,
as seen from the frequently reported fire and explosion accidents
of LIBs.3 Since the accidents are mainly
caused by the use of flammable organic electrolytes, it is expected
that the development of all-solid-state secondary batteries using
solid electrolytes would contribute to solving the safety problem
of LIBs.4 On the other hand, an all-solid-state
primary battery (lithium–iodine battery) is already commercially
available.5 However, it is very difficult
to recharge the lithium–iodine battery because lithium iodide
produced by the discharge of the battery is electrochemically inactive
due to its low electric conductivity.

We have previously investigated
the electrode properties of several
kinds of molecules encapsulated in single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs).6−8 Some of the molecules we tested do not show good
electrode properties originally because of their low electric conductivities.
However, by encapsulating them inside SWCNTs, they can work as electrode-active
materials because SWCNTs provide good electron conductive path from
the current collector to the encapsulated molecules.9

Iodine molecules (I2) can be encapsulated
inside SWCNTs.
We have developed a very easy encapsulation method using the electro-oxidation
of iodine ions in SWCNTs.9 We inserted
I2 molecules in several kinds of SWCNTs having different
mean tube diameters by the electro-oxidation method.10 We have also reported the detailed structural properties
of the encapsulated I2 molecules in SWCNTs at several temperatures.10,11

If iodine molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs (I@SWCNT) are used
as
electrode-active materials in LIB, the electrode reaction product
(LiI) should be formed inside SWCNT hollow cores. However, it is very
difficult to grow a three-dimensional rock-salt crystal of LiI in
an SWCNT core because the diameter of SWCNT is very small. Therefore,
unusual crystal or molecule-like forms of LiI are more likely to form
inside SWCNT. Such unusual forms of LiI should be unstable and reactive.
The reactive LiI inside SWCNT also has a good electron-transfer path
from the host SWCNT. So, it should be possible to extract Li ions
from such LiI entity encapsulated in SWCNT by electrochemical methods,
namely, we would be able to charge and discharge I@SWCNTs. If that
is possible, we can design a new all-solid-state battery using I@SWCNTs.

In this work, we found by electrochemical measurements that I@SWCNTs
can charge and discharge Li ions reversibly. To discuss the electrode
reaction mechanism, we also performed ex situ Raman measurements of
I@SWCNT during the charge–discharge process.

2 Results and Discussion
We prepared the I@SWCNR sample by
the electro-oxidation method.
The encapsulation of iodine molecules in SWCNTs was confirmed by X-ray
absorption near edge structure (XANES), Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and other measurements. As previously reported, iodine molecules are
encapsulated mainly as a form of I2 (Figure S3).10,11 However, some iodine molecules
are transformed to polyiodide ions such as I3– and I5– by charge transfer from SWCNTs
to the encapsulated iodine molecules.10 This is confirmed by the Raman spectrum of the prepared I@SWCNT
sample (see the inset of Figure 1).

Figure 1 Raman spectra of (a) pristine SWCNT and (b) I@SWCNT samples.

It was reported that the composition
ratio of several kinds of
polyiodide ions depends on the tube diameter of the host SWCNT and
temperature. As shown in Figure 1, I5– is the dominant
polyiodide ion in the present sample. If SWCNTs are well crystallized
and the tube diameter distribution is very small, SWCNTs are gathered
by van der Waals interaction and form a two-dimensional quasi-hexagonal
bundle structure. In the case of the present SWCNT sample, we could
observe clear diffractions of the bundle structure. It is well known
that the most intense 100 diffraction peak on the observed diffraction
pattern loses its intensity if guest molecules are inserted in SWCNTs.
The intensity decrease of 100 diffraction peak clearly indicated the
encapsulation of iodine molecules.9 It
is possible to estimate the amount of the encapsulated iodine molecules
qualitatively from the decrease in the 100 diffraction peak intensity.
However, to evaluate the amount quantitatively, thermogravimetric
(TG) measurement is the necessary technique. TG measurement showed
that the present I@SWCNT sample includes 39 wt % iodine molecules
(Figure S4).

Here, we discuss the
volumetric density of the encapsulated iodine
molecules of the present I@SWCNT sample. The mean tube diameter of
the present SWCNT sample is about 2.5 nm. For simplification, we calculated
the volumetric density of the encapsulated iodine molecules of 39
wt %, assuming them to be encapsulated in an SWCNT of chirality (18,
18) that has a diameter close to the mean tube diameter in our study.
We obtained the value of 0.8 g/cm3, which is much less
than the iodine crystal density of 4.93 g/cm3, indicating
that iodine molecules of the present I@SWCNT are not densely packed
inside SWCNTs.

We performed Li-ion charge and discharge measurements
of I@SWCNT
(Figure 2). Since potential
plateaus are seen on both the charge and discharge curves, reversible
adsorption and extraction of Li ions can occur at the I@SWCNT electrode.
Assuming that I2 molecule reacts with Li ion in the manner
shown below, the theoretical capacity of I2 molecule is
calculated to be 211 mAh/g12 1   2  As shown in Figure 2, the observed discharge
capacity of about
150 mAh/g, which indicates that about three-fourths of the encapsulated
I2 molecules are converted to LiI.

Figure 2 Charge and discharge
curves of I@SWCNT observed at constant charge
density of 40 mA/g, where “g” means weight of iodine
in the electrode.

Figure 3A shows
the cyclic voltammograms of the I@SWCNT electrode. Clear redox peaks
were observed at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. Redox pairs marked with (a)
and (b) are attributed to the Li insertion/extraction reactions shown
in eqs 1 and 2, respectively. Half-wave potential E1/2 can be obtained by averaging oxidation and reduction
peak potential values. The E1/2 values
of reactions (a) and (b) were about 3.6 and 2.9 V, respectively. These
two values are a little higher than the observed two-step plateau
potentials (Figure 2). However, we should note that the plateau potential observed by
charge–discharge measurement does not correspond to the equilibrium
state. To know the two-step plateau potentials of equilibrium states
of reactions (a) and (b), we have performed galvanostatic intermittent
titration technique (GITT) measurement. The observed open-circuit
potentials by GITT measurement are in fairly good accordance with
the E1/2 values determined by CV measurement.
As shown in Figure 3A, the peak intensity of (b) is about 2 times higher than that of
(a). This can be explained by the difference of reaction electron
numbers of eqs 1 and 2. On the other hand, redox peaks are not clearly
seen at higher scan rate (Figure 3B) probably because the redox reaction of the I@SWCNT
electrode is very slow. Li+ diffusion length of the I@SWCNT
electrode is very long (μm order) because Li+ cannot
pass through the side wall of SWCNT. We also observed very large electrochemical
impedance for both the lithiated and delithiated states of I@SWCNT
electrode (Figure S5). These electrochemical
observations support that the electrode reactions occur inside the
carbon nanotubes.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammograms of I@SWCNT: scan rates of (A) 1 mV/s
and (B)
1–10 mV/s.

The above-mentioned redox
reactions were more clearly seen in the
differential chrono-potentiogram. Figure S6 shows the differential chrono-potentiometry graph for the discharge
process (Li insertion process) of I@SWCNT. As shown in Figure S7, two peaks at about 3.35 and 2.85 V
are clearly seen. These two peaks correspond to the two-step electrochemical
reactions mentioned above. The discharge capacities for the former
and latter reactions are about 30 and 70 mAh/g, respectively (Figure S8). This capacity ratio (30:70) is very
close to the theoretical ratio (1:2) of the electric quantity required
for the two-step reactions.

Figure S9 shows I 3d X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) image observed for the discharged (Li-inserted)
I@SWCNT sample. Although the observed spectrum is very noisy, two
peaks of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 are clearly seen.
The binding energies of I 3d5/2 are 619.3 and 620.2 eV
for I– (LiI) and I0 (I2),
respectively.13 The observed binding energy
of the discharged sample is between the two values (Figure S9). This can be explained that about three-fourths
of the encapsulated I2 molecules are converted to LiI,
as mentioned above.

The capacity value did not decrease much
at least within a few
cycles (Figure S11). This means that most
iodine molecules are kept in SWCNT hollow cores during charge–discharge
cycles. We previously reported that several kinds of molecules (e.g.,
anthraquinone, sulfur, phosphorus) encapsulated in SWCNTs work as
Li-ion battery electrode.6−8 As with other molecules, the encapsulation
of iodine molecules provides them with a good electrically conductive
path from SWCNTs and good stability against dissolution in the electrolyte.
The present charge–discharge experiment revealed that Li ions
caught by iodine molecules in SWCNTs can be reextracted reversibly.
On the other hand, the practical Li–iodine all-solid-state
battery is a primary battery. We cannot recharge the discharged Li–iodine
cell mainly because it is very hard to extract Li ions from LiI produced
in the discharge process. However, and as we wrote above, I@SWCNT
can charge and discharge Li ions reversibly, which indicates that
the LiI formed inside the nanotubes is electrochemically active probably
because of the good electron-transfer path from SWCNTs to LiI molecule-like
products in SWCNTs. Usually, LiI is a rock-salt-type three-dimensional
crystal. However, it would be very difficult to form three-dimensional
crystals inside the nanotube, although rock-salt LiI having a density
of 3.49 g/cm3 would only occupy 24% of the tube inner space,
assuming that all iodine molecules of the present I@SWCNT sample are
converted to LiI. Instead of a rock-salt-type three-dimensional crystal,
it is probable that an electrochemically active “LiI molecule-like
product” was produced inside the tube.

To confirm that
iodine molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs can catch
and release Li ions, we performed Raman measurements of I@SWCNT during
the charge–discharge process. Figure 3A shows the low-wavenumber region of the
observed Raman spectra. For an SWCNT sample, radial breathing modes
(RBMs) are usually observed in the low-wavenumber region. It is well
known that the peak position of RBM is inversely proportional to the
tube diameter of SWCNT and that some semiempirical equations are used
to describe the relationship between the tube diameter d and RBM peak position ωRBM (e.g., d = 248/ωRBM).14−17 In the present study, the mean tube diameter of the
SWCNT sample is about 2.5 nm and the expected RBM peak position is
less than 100 cm–1, which is the experimental lower
limit due to the edge filter used in the present Raman measurement.
Therefore, only the tail of the RBM was observed in the range of 100–150
cm–1 of the spectrum (a) of the empty SWCNT sample
in Figure 4A. On the
other hand, two peaks at about 110 and 160 cm–1 were
observed on the spectrum (b) of the I@SWCNT sample. The peaks at about
110 and 160 cm–1 correspond to I3– and I5–.10 As discussed in the previous report, the majority of the
encapsulated iodine molecules exist as I2. However, a small
portion of I2 is transformed to polyiodide ions by charge-transfer
reaction between SWCNT and I2. The observed Raman peaks
of polyiodide ions are the indicator of the existence of iodine molecules
in the I@SWCNT sample. In the previous section, we mentioned that
iodine molecules are transformed to LiI when Li ions are inserted
in I@SWCNT. This transformation is confirmed by the disappearance
of the Raman peaks of polyiodide ions in the spectrum (c) of the discharged
I@SWCNT sample. Strictly speaking, Raman peaks of polyiodide ions
did not disappear completely because one-fourth of I2 molecules
encapsulated in SWCNTs should remain as discussed in Figure 2. Interestingly, upon recharging
the discharged I@SWCNT sample, the Raman peaks of polyiodide ions
were again observed on the spectrum (d). This means that LiI produced
by the discharge of I@SWCNT is converted to I2 by the recharging
process.

Figure 4 (A) Low-wavenumber region and (B) G-band-region Raman spectra of
(a) empty SWCNT, (b) I@SWCNT, (c) discharged (Li-ion-inserted) I@SWCNT,
and (d) charged I@SWCNT samples.

Figure 4B
shows
the change in Raman G-band spectrum of I@SWCNT during the Li-ion charge–discharge
process. The G-band peak position of SWCNTs shifts toward the higher-wavenumber
side by encapsulating electron acceptors. It was observed in Figure 4B that the G-band
peak position of empty SWCNT (spectrum (a)) shifts to 1590 cm–1 by iodine insertion (spectrum (b)). The G-band peak
position of I@SWCNT shifted back to the lower-wavenumber side with
Li-ion insertion (spectrum (c)). By Li-ion insertion to I@SWCNT, iodine
molecules having high electron negativity encapsulated in SWCNT are
converted to LiI having low electron negativity. This is the reason
why the G-band peak position of the discharged I@SWCNT sample went
back to a lower wavenumber. By recharging the discharged I@SWCNT sample,
the peak position moved again to the higher-wavenumber side (spectrum
(d)). This clearly shows that it is possible to extract Li ions from
the LiI molecule-like products inside SWCNTs, which was also shown
by the fact that the G-band shifts during the charge–discharge
process are quite consistent with the appearance and disappearance
of the polyiodide ion Raman peaks in the low-wavenumber region.

As discussed above, it was revealed that I@SWCNT can catch and
release Li ions reversibly. Unfortunately, the electrode reactions
inside the nanotubes were not fully clarified by spectroscopic measurements.
We supposed that iodine molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs are converted
to LiI molecule-like products by Li-ion insertion. If we prepare a
sample of LiI encapsulated in SWCNT and achieve Li-ion extraction
from the LiI@SWCNT sample, we can support the hypothesis that LiI
is formed inside the nanotube by Li-ion insertion to I@SWCNT. To that
end, we tried to prepare LiI@SWCNT by heating the reaction glass tube,
in which SWCNTs and LiI powder samples were inserted under vacuum.
However, the reaction glass tube was repeatedly ruptured during the
heat treatment, probably due to the high reactivity of LiI. Therefore,
we decided to replace LiI with CsI because the preparation of CsI@SWCNT
(CsI encapsulated in SWCNT) was already done according to a previous
work.18 The encapsulation of CsI was confirmed
by several characterization techniques such as transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), XRD, and Raman
spectroscopy as done in the previous work. The amount of the encapsulated
CsI was determined to be 44 wt % from the sample weight increase with
CsI insertion. We prepared a test cell consisting of the CsI@SWCNT
sample as working electrode and Li metal as counter electrode and
performed a charge experiment corresponding to Cs ion extraction from
CsI@SWCNT (Figure 5). Figure 4 shows
the observed charge curve that is quite similar to the charge curve
of I@SWCNT in Figure 2. The redox potential of Cs (E0 = −2.92
V) is the same as that of Li (E0 = −3.05
V). This results in similar charge plateau potentials of CsI@SWCNT
(Figure 7) and I@SWCNT
(Figure 2).

Figure 5 Li-ion charge
(Li-ion insertion) curve of CsI@SWCNT observed at
constant charge density of 40 mA/g.

We also performed Raman measurements for CsI@SWCNT before
and after
electrochemical measurements as we did for I@SWCNT. As shown in Figure 6A,B, no significant
change was observed in the low-wavenumber and G-band regions by encapsulating
CsI in empty SWCNTs. On the other hand, we observed after the charge
experiment the appearance of the Raman peaks of polyiodide ions and
also a shift in the G-band peak (spectra (c) in Figure 6A,B). In the present charge experiment of Figure 5, we extracted Cs
ions corresponding to the capacity of about 70 mAh/g. Assuming that
I2 molecules are produced by the extraction of Cs ions
from CsI@SWCNT, we estimate that about 70% of CsI in SWCNTs has transformed
to I2 because the theoretical capacity of CsI is calculated
to be 103.2 mAh/g.

spectra of
(a) empty SWCNT, (b) CsI@SWCNT, and (c) the charged (Cs ion extracted)
CsI@SWCNT samples.

So far, we have discussed
the charge–discharge experiments
of I@SWCNT and CsI@SWCNT using 1 M lithium bis(trifluoro methanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI)/1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and dimethyl ether (DME) liquid electrolyte.
Since the liquid electrolyte restrains the shuttle reactions of iodide-relating
species, we can perform charge–discharge experiments of I@SWCNT
in a relatively short period, as short as the present experiments.
However, it is essentially very difficult to use iodine species as
a battery electrode using liquid electrolyte because iodine species
are easily dissolved in liquid electrolyte. We therefore investigated
the electrode behavior of I@SWCNT using a solid electrolyte. Poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO)-containing LiClO4 ([O](PEO)/[Li] = 8:1) was
used as the solid electrolyte. A test cell consisting of I@SWCNT as
the working electrode, Li metal as the counter electrode, and PEO
solid electrolyte was operated at 60 °C to achieve good ionic
conductivity of Li ion in PEO. Figure 7 shows the observed
charge–discharge curves. We observed a relatively large reversible
capacity, albeit smaller than that observed in liquid electrolyte.
These results show that I@SWCNT can catch and release Li ions reversibly
even in solid electrolyte. The reversibility was obtained probably
due to the observed fact that the LiI molecule-like products in SWCNTs
produced by Li-ion insertion to I@SWCNT are very active as we have
discussed.

electrolyte observed at constant charge density of 15 mA/g at 60 °C.

3 Conclusions
We prepared
the I@SWCNT sample by the electro-oxidation of iodide
ions with empty SWCNT electrode. Li-ion battery electrode properties
of I@SWCNT were investigated, showing that the I@SWCNT sample can
catch and release Li ions reversibly. We performed Raman measurements
to reveal the Li-ion storage mechanism of I@SWCNT. It is plausible
that chemical reactions of I2 from/into LiI in SWCNTs occur
during the process of Li-ion charge–discharge performed on
the I@SWCNT electrode. We also prepared the CsI@SWCNT sample to verify
that alkali metal ions can be extracted from alkali metal halide in
SWCNTs, which we confirmed through Raman measurements performed on
CsI@SWCNT. It was also found that I@SWCNT can catch and release Li
ions reversibly even in a solid electrolyte.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Encapsulation of Iodine Molecules in SWCNTs
We purchased an SWCNT sample (EC type) from Meijo NanoCarbon Co.
First, we performed purification treatment using acid to remove metal
impurity. The detailed purification procedure is described in our
previous papers.6−8,10,19,20 The removal of metal impurity
was confirmed by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure S1). The sample was annealed at 1250 °C under
vacuum to improve its crystallinity. The high-temperature annealing
not only decreases the surface defects of SWCNTs but also closes the
tube ends by forming half-fullerene caps at those ends. Subsequently,
we performed air oxidation treatments to open the closed ends by burning
the half-fullerene caps. The tube opening was confirmed by N2 adsorption measurements.19 Iodine molecules
were inserted into SWCNTs by electrochemical oxidation of iodide ions
in electrolytic solution. To achieve electrochemical iodine insertion,
we fabricated a three-electrode configuration cell using paper-form
SWCNT (Figure S2) as the working electrode,
Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
NaI aqueous solution (1 M) was used as the electrolyte, and we applied
1.8 V to SWCNT electrode for 15 min.9 After
the encapsulation treatments, we washed the SWCNT samples by distilled
water to remove the iodine molecules deposited on the outer surfaces
of SWCNTs and dried the washed samples. The amount of the encapsulated
iodine molecules was determined by TG measurements.10 We also performed Raman measurements to check the crystallinity
and synchrotron XRD measurements at BL-18C at the Photon Factory (PF—High
Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan) to determine
the mean tube diameter. The nanostructure of the obtained samples
was observed using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-z2500)
operated at 200 kV.

4.2 Li-Ion Charge–Discharge
Experiments
of I@SWCNT with Liquid Electrolyte
The paper-form I@SWCNT
sample on a Cu foil was used for Li-ion charge–discharge experiments.
Li metal foil was used as the counter electrode. Lithium bis(trifluoro
methanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/1,3-dioxolane (DOL) + dimethyl ether
(DME) (1 mol/L) was used as electrolyte. The charge–discharge
measurements using a conventional two-electrode-type cell (Hohsen,
HS-Cell) were conducted using a galvanostat (Toyo System, TOSCAT-3200).
The cell assembly was performed in an Ar-filled glovebox to avoid
exposure to air and contamination. Charge–discharge experiments
were done at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were
performed using a three-electrode-type cell (working electrode: I@SWCNT;
counter electrode: Li metal foil; reference electrode: Li metal foil).
Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement
with an intermittent current rate of 100 mA/g and periodic intermission
for 30 min was performed to measure open-circuit potential at a different
state of charge. Alternating current impedance spectroscopy measurement
was performed using an electrochemical impedance analyzer (Autolab
PGSTAT128N). To understand the structural changes of iodine molecules
encapsulated in SWCNTs, Raman measurements were performed using a
JASCO NRS-3300 spectrometer. To analyze the discharged sample, we
performed XPS measurements on ULVAC-PHI PHI5000.

4.3 Encapsulation of CsI in SWCNTs
CsI
powder sample and SWCNTs were heat-treated at 580 °C in an evacuated
glass tube for 14 h. The encapsulation of CsI was confirmed by TEM,
SEM, Raman, and XRD measurements.

4.4 Li-Ion
Charge–Discharge Experiments
of I@SWCNT with Solid Electrolyte
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
including LiClO4 ([O](PEO)/[Li] = 8:1) was used as a solid
electrolyte. A test cell consisting of the I@SWCNT working electrode
and Li metal counter electrode with PEO solid electrolyte was used.
Charge–discharge experiments were done in a temperature chamber
(Espec SU-241) to control the temperature of the test cell at 60 °C
to obtain good ion conductivity.
