Guanine-rich single-stranded DNAs
and RNAs that fold into G-quadruplexes
(GQs) are known to complex tightly with FeII-heme and FeIII-heme (hemin), ubiquitous cellular cofactors. Heme–GQ
(DNA) complexes, known as heme·DNAzymes, are able to utilize
hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant to vigorously catalyze a variety of
one-electron (peroxidase) and two-electron (peroxygenase) oxidation
reactions. Herein, we show that complexes of FeII-heme
with GQs also robustly catalyze a mechanistically distinct reaction,
carbene transfer to an alkene substrate. Significant enhancements
were seen in both reaction kinetics and product turnover (∼180)
relative to disaggregated FeII-heme in the absence of DNA
or in the presence of other DNA folds, such as single-stranded or
double-stranded DNA. Heme binds to GQs by end-stacking. Simple, intramolecularly
folded GQs are unable to provide a complexly structured “distal
side” environment to the bound heme; therefore, such DNAzymes
do not display significant product stereoselectivity. However, intermolecular
GQs with multiple pendant nucleotides show increasing stereoselectivity
in addition to their enhanced catalytic rates. These results recapitulate
the unique functional synergy and highlight the surprising catalytic
versatility of complexes formed between heme and DNA/RNA GQs. Our
findings suggest that heme·DNAzymes and heme·ribozymes may
prove to be useful reagents for carbon–carbon bond forming
“green” reactions carried out in vitro and likely within
living cells.

Introduction
Heme (Fe–protoporphyrin
IX), in its FeII and
FeIII oxidation states, is a ubiquitous cellular cofactor,
responsible for a variety of metabolic functions. These multitudinous
functions of heme occur within complexes formed by it with various
cellular apoproteins, to give diverse hemoproteins such as the various
cytochromes, peroxidases, gas transfer proteins such as myoglobin
and hemoglobin, and nitric oxide synthase. Recently, however, DNA
and RNA, anionic biopolymers, have been found to have unexpected interactions
with heme in vitro and possibly in vivo.1−3 Notably, single-stranded
RNA and DNA molecules that fold, under physiological conditions, into
guanine-quadruplexes (G-quadruplexes, or “GQ”), held
together by guanine base-quartets (G-quartets) (Figure 1), have been shown to specifically and strongly
bind heme in both of its iron oxidation states. GQs can be formed
in a number of different ways, such as from the intramolecular folding
of a single DNA/RNA strand containing four stretches of guanines;
or intermolecular GQs, assembled from four separate and guanine-rich
DNA/RNA single strands. GQs are specifically stabilized by the binding
within the spatial cavity that exists within as well as in between
successive G-quartets of Na+ or K+ cations.

a parallel-stranded intramolecular GQ DNA (GQ) complexed with heme.
The blue rectangles represent guanine-quartets, and the red square

The tight complexes of FeIII-heme with GQs have
been
shown to powerfully catalyze one-electron (peroxidase) as well as
two-electron (peroxygenase) oxidation reactions, this activity exceeding
by orders of magnitude those of either uncomplexed heme in the presence
of noninteracting DNAs or RNAs, or of heme itself, disaggregated by
a variety of anionic, cationic, and charge-neutral surfactants.1,4 Heme (Figure 1c)
has been shown to end-stack (Figure 1d) upon a terminal G-quartet of the GQ;5−7 FeIII-heme within such a complex is a six-coordinated
complex at neutral pH,1,5−7 with both its
proximal and distal axial ligands at neutral pH being water. Recent
NMR studies have revealed the bound heme’s proximal axial ligand
(i.e., the one pointing toward the DNA) is a water molecule positioned
within the natural cavity of the most heme-proximal G-quartet.8

The UV–vis spectra of a GQ·FeIII-heme complex
(Figure S1a) resembles that of hemoproteins
such as metmyoglobin.1 To date, the GQ·FeIII-heme catalytic complexes (generically termed “heme·DNAzymes”
and “heme·ribozymes” or “peroxidase-mimicking
ribozymes/DNAzymes”) have found broad utility as reporters
and reagents in both bioanalytical chemistry and bionanotechnology
(reviewed in refs2,9). What is particularly interesting about this catalytic system is
that it is highly specific to the GQ and to no other fold of natural
RNA and DNA; and, furthermore, it is capable of efficiently replicating
the catalytic activities of the peroxidase, oxygenase, and peroxygenase
classes of hemoproteins. Relative to hemoproteins, heme·DNAzymes
offer numerous advantages as oxidative catalysts, such as their small
size, inexpensiveness, chemical robustness, ease of storage, facile
synthesis and manipulation, and amenability to rational design and
allosteric control. Such a combination of useful properties provides
a powerful catalytic toolkit for biosensing, for the design of new
biomaterials, and as reporters for a variety of analytical and other
biomolecular devices.

We have been interested in exploring whether
beyond the abovementioned
oxidative activities, heme·DNAzymes have a larger, unexplored
catalytic repertoire. Most intriguing to test for is the potential
catalysis of carbene transfer reactions [such as to recipient alkenes
from a diazo donor compound such as ethyl diazoacetate (EDA)—Figure 1a]. Transition-metal-mediated
carbene insertion reactions have received a great deal of attention
recently; it has been reported that FeII–porphyrin
complexes are efficient catalysts for this reaction.10 Indeed, proteinaceous heme enzymes such as myoglobin and
the cytochrome P450 P450CAM have been subjected to intensive mutagenesis
and directed evolution. Mutant forms of these hemoproteins have been
generated, which show superior catalysis of carbene transfer reactions
compared to the wild-type proteins, with good catalytic enhancement,
substrate turnover, as well as enhanced regio- and stereoselectivity.11,12

We therefore wished to test whether heme·DNAzymes and
ribozymes,
composed wholly of biological and bioavailable materials (heme; G-rich
RNAs and DNAs), could be applied to the efficient catalysis of carbene
insertion chemistries. If this were found to be so, it would not only
broaden our conception of the biocatalytic repertoire available to
these unique ribozymes and DNAzymes, but also, comparably to the engineered
hemoproteins referred to above,10−12 these ribozymes and DNAzymes
could find potential large-scale application for the “green”
biosynthesis of novel organic compounds within living cells, perhaps
on an industrial scale.

Roelfes and colleagues have reported
the interesting utility of
certain synthetic, cationic iron porphyrins, complexed to double-helical
DNA, to catalyze carbene insertion reactions, often with notable stereoselectivity.13 In these systems, the second coordination sphere
supplied by the DNA to the iron of the metalloporphyrin presents a
complex and likely chiral environment toward this catalysis.14

However, given that the bioavailable cofactor heme is our chosen metalloporphyrin, we wished to test,
first, whether
different DNA folds (such as single strands, double helices and GQs)
were equally or differentially capable of activating heme toward enhanced
catalysis of carbene transfer in vitro, paying particular attention
toward whether some of the attractive catalytic features [enhancements
in product yield, turnover number (TON), and stereoselectivity] achieved
by the engineered and evolved hemoproteins10−12 might also
be shown by heme·DNAzymes.

In this paper, we show that
GQs are indeed the only natural DNA/RNA
higher-order structure to activate heme toward efficient carbene insertion
chemistry. We explore the requirement for reducing and/or anaerobic
environments for this catalysis; investigate the kinetics, substrate
TONs, and the heme-dependence of heme·DNAzymes. Given that our
chosen substrate, styrene, is hydrophobic, we explore the impact of
organic cosolvents on this catalysis. We compare the performance of
heme·DNAzymes with that of a cationic iron porphyrin in the presence
of different folds of DNA. We go on to explore the stereoselectivity
of different heme·DNAzymes, and finally, set out a clear set
of long-term prospects for this unique class of biocatalysts.

Results
and Discussion
Complex of Fe(II) Heme with a DNA GQ Catalyzes
Carbene Insertion
into Styrene
Hemin–GQ complexes have been extensively
studied for their robust 1e– and 2e– mimicking activities and their versatile applications. Travascio
et al. optimized the conditions for the optimal oxidative catalysis
by the FeIII-heme·DNAzymes.1 A buffer pH of 8.0; potassium salts; a nitrogenous buffer such as
NH4–HEPES or collidine (such amines participate
in general acid–base chemistry to enhance the overall catalysis15); and a low concentration (>critical micelle
concentration) of a nonionic detergent X-100 to help solubilize and
disaggregate the added hemin,1,2 were key elements of
an optimally catalytic solution. Using these same experimental conditions
as a starting point, we investigated whether a heme·DNAzyme could
catalyze a carbene transfer reaction (in comparison to heme alone
or in the presence of other DNA folds) using the benchmark substrate
(styrene) and ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) as the carbene donor. The gas
chromatography (GC) elution profiles and retention time values of
the various cyclopropane (“cPr”) products (diastereomers;
and enantiomers in a chiral analysis) have been well characterized
and standardized;11 it was therefore useful
for us to attempt this reaction, to take advantage of facile identification
of any products formed.

First, we used UV–vis spectroscopy
to measure the binding affinity of FeII-heme to an intramolecularly
folded DNA GQ (“G4”). Figure S2 shows the titration of a fixed concentration (0.5 μM) of FeII-heme with 0–16 μM “G4”. A dissociation
constant (Kd) of 1.3 μM was computed
from these data.

Next, we investigated the impact of heme in
the presence of a molar
excess of intramolecularly folded “G4” on the carbene
transfer reaction [against controls of disaggregated hemin alone or
in the presence of excess “double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)”
(salmon sperm genomic DNA); or excess single-stranded “scrambled
G4”]. The reaction was carried out in the usual heme·DNAzyme
reaction buffer (40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM
KCl, 10 mM Na2S2O4, 1% dimethylformamide
(DMF), 0.05% Triton X-100) and the reactants were added to final concentrations
of 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 17 μM hemin, and 83 μM DNA.
This carbene transfer reaction requires the participation of FeII-heme (rather than FeIII-heme); it is therefore
carried out most logically under anaerobic conditions (deoxygenated
buffer, under argon, in the presence of a reducing agent).11,12Figure 2 shows that
under such an inert atmosphere, FeII-heme with excess G4
generates, after 1 h of reaction, a high yield of the cPr products
(∼26-fold higher than the heme-alone control and the heme-dsDNA
control, and ∼7-fold higher than the heme and scrambled G4
control).

Figure 2 Gas chromatogram of cis- and trans-cPr, products obtained using hemin (Fe-III) heme as a catalyst in
the absence and presence of DNA, namely, of excess salmon sperm “dsDNA”;
“scrambled G4 DNA”; and “G4”, respectively.
Reactions were carried out for 2 h at 22 °C, under anaerobic
conditions, with 83 μM DNA, 30 μM hemin, 1 mM styrene,
7 mM EDA, and 10 mM Na2S2O4.

A recent publication on this reaction catalyzed
by a nonheme iron
cationic porphyrin in the presence of dsDNA has reported moderate
yields of the product in the absence of both reducing agent and argon.13 However, we thought it useful to systematically
examine the effect of these reagents/conditions upon the heme·DNAzyme-catalyzed
carbene transfer reaction under our experimental conditions (Figure 3). Table S1 summarizes the detailed results. Under optimal conditions,
with both sodium dithionite and argon present, the cPr product yield
with the heme·DNAzyme was 75% after 1 h of reaction. In the absence
of the reducing agent but in the presence of argon, the yield was
36%; this is because EDA itself is able to act to a degree as a reducing
agent;16 however, in the presence of the
reducing agent but in the absence of argon, the yield was 8%. In the
absence of both reducing agent and argon, the yield was only 4%. Clearly,
then, the effectiveness of this nucleic acid-based catalytic system
shares the requirements with hemoproteins for an anaerobic atmosphere
and a reducing agent to maintain the FeII state of the
DNA-complexed heme.

Figure 3 Impact of a reducing agent (sodium dithionite) and an
anaerobic
atmosphere (presence of argon) on the catalyzed production of cPr
products by heme in the presence of different DNA folds. The generic
reaction conditions were: 83 μM DNA (“dsDNA”,
“scrambled G4”, or “G4”), 30 μM
hemin, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 10 mM Na2S2O4 in reaction buffer: 40 mM HEPES–NH4OH,
pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, and 0.05% Triton X-100. For each set of
data (blue, black, green, and red), the first bar (“a”)
shows reaction in the absence of both dithionite and argon; “b”
shows reaction in the presence of dithionite but in the absence of
argon; “c” shows reaction in the absence of dithionite
but in the presence of argon; and “d” shows the reaction
in the presence of both dithionite and argon.

Kinetics of Carbene Insertion Reaction
To obtain an
insight into individual reagent concentrations that might limit the
optimal kinetics and yield of the heme·DNAzyme-catalyzed cPr
products, we prepared five identical, standard reaction solutions
in the reaction buffer (83 μM “G4” DNA, 17 μM
hemin, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 10 mM Na2S2O4 in a buffer of 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0,
20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, 0.05% Triton X-100, under anaerobic conditions
at 21 °C). Each reaction proceeded for 1 h, following which,
10 μL of supplementations of one single reagent (heme; styrene;
EDA; or “G4” DNA) were made to individual reaction vials
under anaerobic conditions. The different reactions now had, variously,
heme to a final concentration of 33 μM; styrene to a final of
2 mM; EDA to a final 13 mM; or “G4” DNA to a final 116
μM. One of the reaction vials had no supplementation made to
it, as a negative control. Following the various supplementations,
the reactions were allowed to proceed for one further hour prior to
termination and extraction using ethyl acetate. Figure S3 shows that relative to the negative control, no
increase in cPr product formation was observed with either EDA or
G4 DNA supplementations. By contrast, the product yield increased
by 25–30% with both the styrene and hemin supplementations.
Therefore, under our experimental conditions, heme and styrene were
limiting reagents.

In order to evaluate the kinetics of product
formation, eight separate samples were prepared identically for each
DNA variant, and the reaction was carried out at different time points. Figure 4a shows the product
yields obtained for experiments using 30 μM hemin in the presence
of, variously, no added DNA; 80 μM “G4” DNA; “scrambled
G4” DNA; and duplex (“dsDNA”). The product yield
obtained with G4, after 1 h, was 77%. By contrast, with the other
DNAs, the yields obtained after 2 h were 3% (heme only/no DNA) 3%
(heme with dsDNA), and 11% (heme with scrambled G4 DNA).

80 μM DNA, 30 μM hemin, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 10 mM
Na2S2O4 in a reaction buffer consisting
of 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, 0.05%
Triton X-100, under anaerobic conditions at 21 °C. (b) Heme-dependence
for the formation of cPr products by the heme–“G4”
complex (heme·DNAzyme). Reactions were carried out for 1 h, under
anaerobic condition, with a fixed concentration of “G4”
DNA (83 μM) paired with varying concentrations (10, 20, 40,
60, 80, and 100 μM) of heme. The reaction solutions contained,
in addition to the above, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, and 10 mM Na2S2O4 in a buffer solution consisting
of 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, and
0.05% Triton X-100.

We investigated the importance
of hemin concentration (0–100
μM) for the G4–heme DNAzyme under the above conditions. Figure 4b shows that with
all other reactant concentrations being held constant (83 μM
“G4” DNA; 1 mM styrene; and 7 mM EDA), the cPr product
yield after 1 h rose monotonically to heme concentrations up to ∼40
μM (where the heme–G4 DNA ratio was 0.5), and plateaued
beyond that; 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μM heme (in combination
with 83 μM G4) correspond, respectively, to 1, 2 4, 6, 8, and
10 mol % enzyme loading with respect to the styrene substrate. At
the G4–heme ratio of 2:1, where the product yield starts to
plateau, there was 83% cPr product yield and a TON of 21. At a 1:1
ratio (8 mol % catalyst), a 98% product yield and a TON of 12 were
obtained. Depending on requirements for optimized yield, reaction
rate, or indeed TON in this catalytic system, clearly appropriate
concentrations of the heme·DNAzyme can be rationally chosen.
We chose to use a concentration of 30 μM heme·DNAzyme for
our next set of experiments, so as to ensure product yields of >50%
and allow improvement of the TON through the optimization of styrene
concentration.

Impact of an Organic Cosolvent
Ideally,
a high-quality
catalyst should not be consumed via side reactions distinct from the
main reaction being catalyzed and should enable both high TONs as
well as yield. Earlier studies on the 1e– and 2e– oxidation properties of heme·DNAzyme have shown
that depending on the oxidative chemistry being catalyzed, the heme
moiety gradually deactivates over time. Perhaps, the same drawback
also applies for the carbene insertion reaction. Our initial choice
of styrene concentration (1 mM) was based on maintaining phase homogeneity,
given the poor solubility of styrene in aqueous buffers. In order
to obtain the most optimal combination of reaction rate, product yield,
and TON, we carried out a series of experiments that featured relatively
high heme and styrene (>1 mM) concentrations by incorporating increasing
concentrations of methanol as cosolvent. In an earlier study, Canale
and Sen17 demonstrated that unlike most
protein hemoenzymes, the peroxidase activity of heme·DNAzymes
was strongly enhanced in 20–30% v/v methanol; indeed, the DNAzymes
were still active in solutions containing as high as 80% methanol.17

As described above, under our initial
reaction conditions (1 mM styrene and 7 mM EDA) good substrate yields
(77%) with modest TON were observed. We therefore examined the possibility
of enabling the use of higher styrene concentrations (while maintaining
a constant EDA concentration of 7 mM) by introducing different concentrations
of methanol as cosolvent.

Figure 5 shows time
courses for usage of 10 or 20 mM styrene using 30 μM heme (0.4%
of enzyme loading with respect to EDA), 83 μM “G4”,
and 7 mM EDA. Product yields of 75 and 79% (with respect to EDA),
respectively, were obtained using 10 and 20 mM styrene and 5% methanol
(v/v) as cosolvent. The initial rate of reaction was 1.5-fold faster
with 20 mM styrene than with 10 mM styrene (128 and 87 μM min–1, respectively). Increasing the methanol content to
30% (v/v) in the reaction buffer for the 20 mM styrene reaction, however,
did not significantly impact either the initial reaction rate or product
yield relative to the reaction carried out in the 5% methanol reaction
buffer (v/v). In all cases, the reaction was complete within 1 h.

Figure 5 Effect
of styrene concentration and organic solvent percentage
on carbene insertion reaction kinetics. The reaction conditions were
as follows: 83 μM “G4” DNA, 30 μM hemin,
7 mM EDA, 10 mM Na2S2O4 in a buffer:
40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, 0.05%
Triton-100X and under anaerobic conditions.

Impact of Non-G Residues at the 3′-Ends of Intramolecular
GQs
“G4” (or “G4-AAA”) DNA, which
is an intramolecularly folding GQ widely used for studying and implementing
the oxidative activities of heme·DNAzymes, has three unpaired
adenines at its 3′end. It has been shown that for H2O2-based DNAzyme oxidative activities, the presence of
at least one (or more) of these adenines enhances the kinetics of
catalysis.18 Indeed, these authors found
that the presence of even one unpaired 3′ A residue gave DNAzyme
initial rates >5-fold higher than having n (where n = 1–8) 3′ T residue(s) in place of A.18 The A residue(s) appear to contribute in an
acid–base capacity toward generation of the activated heme
species within oxidative heme·DNAzymes, mimicking the activity
of soluble bases such as ammonia or collidine.15 To investigate whether the kinetics of carbene transfer catalysis of heme·DNAzymes is comparably impacted,
three further GQ DNAs containing one 3′-adenine (“G4-A”),
one thymine (“G4-T”), as well as three thymine residues
(“G4-TTT”) were tested under the same reaction conditions
used for the standard “G4” (“G4-AAA”)
DNAzyme. Table 1 shows
that “G4” and “G4-TTT” manifest essentially
indistinguishable product yields and TONs; Table S2 further iterates that “G4-A” and “G4-T”
likewise generate product yields indistinguishable from that of “G4”.
For the “G4” DNAzyme, to examine whether the potassium
ion concentration we used was sufficient to maximize its folding into
a GQ, we varied the concentration of potassium chloride concentrations
(0, 4, 20 100, 500, 750 mM and 1 M, respectively) and measured
circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the folded “G4” DNA. Figure S4 shows that although the characteristic
CD spectrum of a parallel-stranded GQ was reached at 20 mM KCl, full
spectral saturation was seen at 500 mM KCl. We therefore compared
the cPr product yields by all the GQs used in our study at both 20
and 500 mM KCl concentrations (Table S2). In all cases, use of the higher concentration of potassium chloride
did not lead to any notable change in cPr product yield.

ratios were determined from GC analysis. Yields are based on the available
limiting reagent (styrene or EDA).

Heme Compared to a Cationic Iron Porphyrin (Fe-TMPyP4)
Rioz-Martínez and co-workers have examined the catalytic activities
of a series of cationic iron porphyrins in the presence of dsDNA for
the carbene transfer reaction.13 It is
known that cationic porphyrins with multiple positive charges as well
as metallated versions of the same show strong binding affinities
to DNA, and to GQs in particular. We examined whether a cationic porphyrin,
Fe-meso-tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine
(Fe-TMPyP4), also showed GQ DNA-enhanced catalysis of carbene insertion.
Under our experimental conditions, free Fe-TMPyP4 showed a low level
of (∼4% yield after 1 h) carbene insertion activity (Figure 6), comparable to
that of uncomplexed heme (Figure 4). However, only very modest increases in cPR production
were observed with Fe-TMPyP4 in the presence of “dsDNA”,
“scrambled G4”, and “G4”—yielding
5, 8, and 11% yields of cPr products, respectively. First, to investigate
whether Fe-TMPyP4 does interact with the three different folds of
DNA used in our study, UV–vis spectra of 2 μM Fe-TMPyP4
were taken (Figure S1) in the absence of
DNA and in the presence of 10 μM “dsDNA”; “scrambled
G4”; or “G4” DNA (both G4, or G4-AAA, and its
variant, G4-TTT, were examined). Unlike the major spectral changes
seen with FeII and FeIII-heme binding to GQ
DNA, a modest but defining red shift (from 422 to 431 nm) is seen
in the Soret band of TMPyP4 in the presence of “G4-AAA”
and “G4-TTT” but not in the presence of “dsDNA”
or “scrambled G4”. Such a relatively small change in
the spectrum of the strongly positively charged porphyrin in the presence
of the different strongly negatively charged DNAs likely reflects
mainly coulombic interactions between the two, which do not impact
in major ways the porphyrin’s absorption spectrum. The consistent
occurrence of the Soret band red shifts, however, is consistent with
the binding of the Fe-TMPyP4 to the three GQ DNAs (G4-AAA, G4-TTT,
and (dA4G5A4)4).

Figure 6 Carbene insertion
reaction kinetics using FeIII-TMPyP4.
Reactions conditions were as follows: 83 μM DNA, 30 μM
porphyrin, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 10 mM Na2S2O4 in reaction buffer (40 mM NH4–HEPES,
pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF, and 0.05% Triton X-100) under anaerobic
conditions.

Table 1 lists a
number of key “performance” parameters for both heme
and Fe-TMPyP4, both in reactions where these porphyrins do not have
any added DNA, and where they do. It can be seen that (a) only the
three GQ folded DNAs, “G4-AAA”, “G4-TTT”,
and “(dA4G5A4)4” in conjunction with heme, generate high TONs as well as
overall reaction yields; heme with no added DNA, or added single-stranded
(scrambled GQ) or dsDNA are poor catalysts for the carbene insertion
reaction. (b) It is only heme that shows this unique catalytic synergy
with GQs toward carbene insertion; the positively charged, highly
DNA-interactive Fe-TMPyP4, by contrast, is not an efficient catalyst
for this reaction, at least under these conditions, either by itself
or in the presence of the different DNAs.

Stereoselectivity
In the styrene carbene insertion
reaction discussed here, the cis and trans diasteromeric cPr products
each consist of a pair of enantiomers. Although many of the wild-type
hemoproteins (cytochromes P450 and metmyoglobin) examined for this
reaction do not impart significant stereoselectivity to the cPr products
generated, a great triumph of directed evolution experiments carried
out by Arnold11 and others12 is that they have generated a variety of mutant hemoproteins
capable of distinctive diastereoselective (i.e., cis/trans ratios)
as well as enantioselective production of the products. Such high
stereoselectivity in the relevant mutant hemoproteins is made possible
by the structures of those enzymes, most notably by the complex spatial
and chemical environments of their active sites on the distal sides
of their heme moieties.

Heme has been shown to stack on the
terminal quartets of parallel-stranded or mixed-orientation GQs, with
preference for binding upon the 3′-most G-quartet.5−8 In such a complex, the G-quartet makes up the “proximal”
side of the heme, whereas the “distal” side of the heme,
at least in unimolecular, propeller-looped GQs such as “G4-AAA”
and “G4-TTT”—Figure 7a), is merely solvent, wholly lacking the
kind of asymmetric spatial architecture that may reasonably impart
selective stereoselectivity to the cPr products obtained. Nevertheless,
we used a GC fitted with a HP-chiral-20B column to investigate any
level of enantiometric excess (ee) within both the trans and cis cPr products catalyzed by the GQ heme·DNAzyme.
All intramolecular GQ variants (“G4-A”, “G4-T”,
“G4-AAA”, and “G4-TTT”) were tested to
see if the pendant purine or pyrimidine bases in those GQs (Figure 7a) influenced ee
of the generated products. In reactions carried out at 22 or 4 °C,
ee values of the enantiomers making up the major, trans cPr product (Figure 8b) were found to be very small (∼1%) (Figure 8a). Such a lack of enantioselectivity from
such structurally simpler, intramolecular GQ DNAzymes was consistent
with earlier results on oxidative catalysis by the
“G4-AAA” DNAzyme, where the hydrogen peroxide-mediated
oxidation of thioanisole likewise showed little enantioselectivity.19

(GQ–heme complexes), where the heme end-stacks, preferentially,
on the 3′-most guanine-quartet (guanine-quartets are shown
as gray squares); (a) “G4-AAA” and “G4-TTT”
oligonucleotides both form intramolecular, propeller looped GQs, with
the 3′ terminal AAA or TTT overhanging (shown as blue rectangles).
(b) An intermolecularly assembled GQ such as “(dA4G5A4)4” is expected to have
a complex “distal” environment above the stacked heme,
potentially imparting stereoselectivity to reactions catalyzed by
the DNA-bound heme.

Figure 8 Chiral gas chromatogram
of the cPr product of the carbene insertion
reaction using (FeIII)-hemin as the catalyst in the presence
of (a) folded “G4-TTT” at 22 °C and (c) “(dA4G5A4)4” GQ at 0 °C.
Reaction conditions were as follows: 83 μM DNA, 30 μM
hemin, 1 mM styrene, 7 mM EDA, 10 mM Na2S2O4 in a buffer: 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20
mM KCl, 1% DMF, 0.05% Triton X-100, under anaerobic conditions. The
identity of the resolved cPr peaks (b) is as described in (11).

Our results this far showed that under our reaction
conditions,
heme in both the absence and presence of three forms of DNA used (single-stranded,
double-stranded, and GQ) clearly favored the formation of the trans cPr product (92%), with both cis and trans products
made up of racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Thus, these intramolecularly
folded DNAzymes catalyzed the formation of cPr products with high
rate and yield (98% using 8% mol DNAzyme), yet showed poor stereoselectivity.
To try and improve stereoselectivity, two further strategies were
examined. First, we examined a different class of parallel-stranded
GQ—the unique, intermolecularly assembled, four-stranded (dA4G5A4)4 (Figure S4). As shown schematically in Figure 7b, the large number of pendant adenines on
both the 5′ and 3′ sides of the central GQ core of “(dA4G5A4)4” potentially
offer structurally more complex distal side environments to the bound
heme. Second, we lowered the reaction temperature of the reaction
down to 0 °C with the aim of reducing the thermal mobility of
any structural complexity offered by the adenine overhangs. The temperature
change in itself had little impact on the stereoselectivity properties
of our original GQs (“G4-AAA” and “G4-TTT”)—no
major change in diastereo- or enantioselectivity was observed for
them between 22 and 0 °C. However, promisingly, “(dA4G5A4)4” gave a 3%
ee for the dominant trans product at room temperature; this figure
enhanced to 10% ee at 0 °C (Figure 8c). These results gave promise that structurally
yet more complex RNA or DNA GQs are likely to offer even higher levels
of stereoselectivity to heme·DNAzyme/ribozyme-catalyzed carbene
transfer reactions. It is worth noting that our initial use of 80
μM total of “dA4G5A4” (Table 1)
generated only ≥20 μM of the four-stranded GQ, (dA4G5A4)4, and gave a correspondingly
lower yield of cPr product relative to the 80 μM concentrations
of intramolecular GQ DNAzymes such as “G4”. However,
increasing the concentration of starting dA4G5A4 in the reaction to 320 μM, prior to incubation
to form the GQ, [(dA4G5A4)4], led to a dramatic increase in cPr product formation, consistent
with those obtained from the other heme·DNAzymes (Table S2).

Conclusions
Herein,
we report that heme·DNAzymes, long valued as versatile
oxene-transfer catalysts to alkenes such as styrene1,2 and
for catalyzing other useful oxidative reactions, are, additionally,
vigorous catalysts for carbene insertion into a model alkene, styrene.
Once again, it is the unique combination of heme and DNA GQs that
shows this new catalytic activity; disaggregated heme by itself or
in combination with other folds of DNA folds does not display this
catalysis. Carbene insertion is thus both a new and distinct catalytic activity of heme·DNAzymes—one,
moreover, that is a net synthetic reaction (forms new carbon–carbon
bonds). Carbene transfer is also the first bona fide catalytic activity
to be demonstrated for the ferrous (FeII) form of heme·DNAzymes
(in contrast with the well-established 1e– and 2e– oxidative catalytic activities of the FeIII-DNAzymes).

The ability of heme·DNAzymes to catalyze carbene
insertion
is characterized by high rates of reaction and high TONs (i.e., the
number of reaction cycles completed by a given molecule of heme·DNAzyme).
With structurally simpler DNAzymes, lacking a complex “distal
side” to their bound hemes, a shortcoming is evident of lack
of interesting stereoselectivity. However, we report that with (dA4G5A4)4, a structurally more
complex GQ that offers a crowded “distal side” environment,
both a distinctive cis/trans ratio of products as well as a nontrivial
ee are obtained, especially when the catalysis is carried out at 0
°C.

It should be noted that a cationic iron porphyrin,
Fe-TMPyP2 (though
not its isomers, such as Fe-TMPyP3) has been shown to bind to the
negatively charged duplex DNA; and the complex so formed showed significant
catalysis of carbene insertion as well as DNA-enhanced stereoselectivity—presumably
owing to a complex structural environment found in the duplex DNA
grooves, Fe-TMPyP3’s presumed locus of binding.13 By contrast, what distinguishes heme·DNAzymes
from the above duplex DNA-cationic porphyrin complexes is, first,
the tight and highly specific complex formed between
the slightly anionic FeII-heme and the highly negatively
charged DNA GQs. Clearly, this interaction is not charge-based and,
above all, permits a sixfold coordination of the bound heme’s
iron center. Our prior work1,2,19 as well as what we report here demonstrate that heme·DNAzymes
are able to support at least two distinct classes of reaction: oxene
and carbene insertions (in addition to purely peroxidase-type 1e– oxidations). That these are indeed mechanistically distinct reactions has been pointed out recently by Wei
et al.,20 who state that “the increasingly
useful C=C functionalizations mediated by heme carbenes feature
an FeII-based, nonradical, concerted nonsynchronous mechanism,
with early transition-state character. This mechanism differs from
the FeIV-based, radical, stepwise mechanism of heme-dependent
monooxygenases”.20 With regard to
the oxidative activity of heme·DNAzymes, we and others have found
the importance of general acid–base catalysis in the activation
of heme by H2O2.1,17−19,21−26 Thus, G4-AAA and G4-CCC show notably enhanced oxidation rates relative
G4-TTT or G4 lacking any pendant 3′ bases. Here, however, we
have shown that G4-AAA and G4-TTT are indistinguishably efficient
in their catalysis of carbene insertion.

GQs, both of genomic
and of artificial origins, constitute a large
and polymorphic family of nucleic acid folds; indeed, some structurally
very complex GQs have recently been reported, including such fluorogenic
RNA aptamers as RNA Mango and RNA Spinach.27−29 Hence, it should
be possible to evolve (via rational design, directed evolution, or
quasi-evolutionary methods such as in vitro selection) yet more structurally
complex quadruplexes—using strategies analogous to the celebrated
directed evolution of pre-existing heme protein enzymes toward novel
functions, as reported by Arnold and others.10,11 We expect that successive generations of more structurally complex
GQs will constitute new heme·DNAzymes capable of high product
yields, high TONs, as well as major product stereoselectivity. Indeed,
there is already a precedent of GQ DNA complexed with a cationic copper
porphyrin enabling asymmetric catalysis of a Diels–Alder reaction.30

It is important to emphasize that unlike
many other metalloporphyrins
used for catalysis, heme is both an intrinsically biological and bioavailable metalloporphyrin, ubiquitous in
all living systems and present in every living cell. RNA and DNA GQs
have also been shown to form in living cells.31 Though rare in bacteria, GQs persist when expressed within them.32 Therefore, the potential exists for heme·ribozymes
expressed within bacteria to catalyze “green” carbene
transfer reactions on a large scale, just as evolved cytochrome P450
enzymes have been enabled to catalyze carbene transfer within living
cells.33 Styrene as a promising alkene
substrate has limited water-solubility; nevertheless, it has been
used successfully for utilization for carbene insertion in living
cells.33

Indeed, as macromolecular
catalysts for in vitro utility, heme·DNAzyme
and ribozymes enjoy a number of advantages over their much larger
protein counterparts—such as wild-type as well as mutated/evolved
hemoproteins such as metmyoglobin and cytochrome P450s. Constituted
solely from small DNA or RNA oligomers and heme, these catalysts are
much smaller than protein enzymes and are chemically robust, as well
as highly functional in organic cosolvents relative to the average
hemoprotein. They are cheap to synthesize and have long shelf-lives.
Future generations of heme·DNAzymes and ribozymes likely hold
significant promise as catalysts for carbon–carbon bond formation
in vitro, and perhaps also on a useful, “green” scale
in vivo.

AGGGC GGGUU GGGAA A-3′. Hemin [FeIII–protoporphyrin
XI] and FeIII-meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine pentachloride [Fe(T4-MePyP)Cl5 or Fe-TMPyP4] were purchased from Frontier Scientific, Inc. Salmon
testis DNA (“dsDNA”), methyl phenyl sulfoxide, trans-1-carbethoxy-2-phenylcyclopropane(ethyl 2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate),
styrene, and EDA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the above
materials were used without further purifications.

A 5 mM hemin
stock was prepared in DMF, aliquoted, and stored in the dark at −20
°C. Hemin was freshly diluted from this stock to the required
final concentration for each experiment. Other stock solutions used
were 1.2 M styrene in MeOH; 400 mM EDA in MeOH; and 60 mM methyl phenyl
sulfoxide in MeOH.

UV–Visible Spectroscopy
A
Varian Cary 300 bio
UV–visible spectrophotometer was used, at room temperature,
with a 10 mm quartz cuvette. 2 μM FeIII-heme (in
the presence or absence of 10 mM of reducing agent) and 2 μM
FeIII-TmPyP4·Cl5 solutions were prepared
both in the absence and presence of the different DNAs (10 μM
final concentration) in the following buffer: 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF (v/v), 0.05% Triton X-100
(w/v).

CD Spectroscopy
CD experiments were carried out in
a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C, using 0.1 cm path-length
cuvettes. CD spectra were recorded both in the absence and presence
of FeIII-heme. The final concentration of different GQ
DNAs was 10 μM in 40 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 1% DMF (v/v),
0.05% Triton X-100 (w/v). The final concentration of FeIII-heme was 0.5 μM. Spectra were recorded between 200 and 320
nm and were averaged from three scans.

Gas Chromatography
An Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph,
equipped with a HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film) capillary
column and interfaced to a 5973 N mass-selective detector was used,
with the following temperature program: 100 °C for 5 min, 5 °C/min
ramp up to 200 °C, 20 °C/min ramp up to 250 °C, then
250 °C for 5 min. Retention times using helium as the carrier
gas (flow rate at 1.6 mL/min) were as follows: cis-cyclopropane products (12.84 min), trans cyclopropane
products (14.3 min). The methods used were essentially the same as
in ref (11), although
the RF values are different owing to the use of a column different
from that used in ref (11). Elution times using hydrogen as the carrier gas had the following
values: cis-cyclopropane products (10.77 min), trans-cyclopropane products (12.14 min). For screening and
quantification of the above cPr products, mass spectra were recorded
in two modes; 115, 117, and 190 mass ions were chosen for the selected
ion monitoring mode with a mass width of 0.2 Da and a scan time of
0.05 s.

Chiral analyses were carried out using GC–flame
ionization detection, which was fitted with a HP-chiral-20B column
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film). Hydrogen was used
as the carrier gas, with the following temperature program: oven temperature
= 100 °C for 5 min; ramped by 1 °C/min to 135 °C; 135
°C for 10 min; ramped by 10 °C/min to 200 °C; 200 °C
for 5 min. The following elution times were obtained: cis-cyclopropane products (39.48 and 40.19 min), and trans-cyclopropanes (41.89 and 42.12 min).

Procedure for Carbene Insertion
Reaction under Anaerobic Conditions
In a GC vial, to 265
μL of 2× reaction buffer (1×
reaction buffer is: 40 mM NH4–HEPES, pH 8.0, 20
mM KCl, 1% DMF, and 0.05% Triton X-100 was added 25 μL DNA (final
concentration of 83 μM), followed by 10 μL of a FeIII-heme stock in DMF (to give final FeIII-heme
concentration of either 17 or 30 μM). The GC vial was sealed,
its contents allowed to mix and incubate at 21 °C for 5 min to
enable proper DNA folding and complexation to FeIII-heme.
The headspace of the sealed GC vial was made anaerobic by flushing
argon over the DNA solution, without causing bubbles (3 min). Using
a disposable syringe, 280 μL of Na2S2O4 in aqueous solution (deoxygenated by bubbling argon) was
added to a final concentration of 10 mM and the reaction mixture was
flushed with argon for another 2 min. Following removal of the gas
line, styrene was added with a glass syringe to final concentrations
of 1, 10, or 20 mM; the mixture was vortexed for 10 s to mix, following
which 10 μL of 400 mM EDA stock in methanol was added (to a
final concentration of ∼7 mM). The complete reaction mixture
was mixed by vortexing and placed on a shaker for the appropriate
reaction time. At the end of the designated reaction interval, the
vial was opened and 10 μL of the internal standard, methyl phenyl
sulfoxide (from a 60 mM stock in MeOH) was added. The reaction mixture
was now extracted with 0.6 mL ethyl acetate. To determine the yield
of the catalyzed reaction, first we calculated a correction factor
between the internal standard (methyl phenyl sulfoxide) and the purchased
standard of trans-cPr, both prepared in the same
solution. The internal response factor (IRF) is defined from the chromatograms
as the (integrated area of internal standard) × [cPr]/[IS] ×
(integrated area of cPr). The concentration of products in the reactions
was calculated using the following equation: [cPr in a reaction] =
[IS added to the reaction] × (area of cPr in the reaction) ×
IRF/(area of IS added to the reaction). Yield = [cPr]reaction/[cPr]max × 100.
