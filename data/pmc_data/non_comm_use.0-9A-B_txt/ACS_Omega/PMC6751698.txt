Herein, a multifunctional
filler, a dye (organic)–clay (inorganic)
hybrid nanopigment (DCNP), was embedded into polylactic acid (PLA)
to fabricate a colored biodegradable/biocompatible film, which is
explored as a high thermomechanical resistant as well as a superior
light and mass transport barrier for food packaging applications.
In this respect, the DCNP was synthesized through a wet chemical process
with a reaction yield of 76% and incorporated into a PLA matrix at
various concentrations using a solution casting method. The morphological
characterizations revealed partially intercalated/exfoliated structure
for PLA–DCNP films. The samples filled with DCNP showed up
to 20% and 12 °C improvements in storage modulus (E′) and glass transition temperature (Tg), respectively, compared to those with neat PLA. Incorporation
of a small amount of DCNP into the PLA matrix significantly declined
the water vapor and gas permeability of PLA by 36 and 54%, respectively.
The optical property investigations indicated remarkable color characteristics
and light protection performance of the samples containing DCNP. The
results also showed better performance of the PLA–DCNP film
compared to that of the PLA–Cloisite 20A sample at an identical
filler loading. In conclusion, the desirable properties of the resulting
films highlighted the potential application of such nanocomposite
films as a promising option for food packaging materials.

Introduction
In response to increasing global concerns
about long-lasting plastic
pollution, biopolymers have attracted enormous attention in both academia
and industry. Polylactic acid (PLA), a biocompatible and biodegradable
polymer derived from renewable resources, has emerged as a compelling
candidate to replace petroleum-based polymers in a wide range of applications.1 However, the use of PLA in food packaging has
been limited by several major drawbacks, including low thermal and
mechanical properties as well as high water vapor, gas, and light
permeability of this macromolecule.2−4 Incorporation of different
nanofillers into polymer matrices is known as one of the most straightforward,
efficient, and cost-effective strategies to address the problems mentioned
above.5−10 Organically modified montmorillonite, a two-dimensional nanofiller
comprising stacks of 1 nm-thick clay platelets, can significantly
improve thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties of PLA even at
small content when the platelets are intercalated or exfoliated during
the dispersion process.11−14 Moreover, it has been reported that the uniformly
dispersed clay layers within PLA can efficiently act as ultraviolet
and visible light shielding agents to protect food containers and
food inside against destructive light radiation.15,16 Colorants have been widely used in food packaging materials not
only for coloration purpose but also for the preservation of foodstuffs
against photodegradation. They are generally classified as organic
and inorganic that each of which possesses their own benefits and
drawbacks. Organic pigments are known for their high tinting strength
but suffer from low light and heat stability as well as the high tendency
to form aggregates while compounding.17 Despite having relatively better dispersibility in polymers and
higher resistance against thermal degradation and photodegradation,
inorganic pigments contain toxic heavy metals and show low color strength
and dull shades.18,19 A dye–clay nanopigment
(DCNP), a nontoxic hybrid coloring nanofiller synthesized via a cationic
exchange reaction (CER) between mineral clays and organic dyes, can
simultaneously present clay and colorant features.20 The DCNP with excellent tinting strength allows using a
much lower amount of colorants to obtain a specific shade compared
to that of conventional organic and inorganic pigments.21 Furthermore, the DCNP can disperse in polymer
matrices easily and offer superior colorimetric properties and color
fastness compared to those of its counterparts.20,22,23 Additionally, it has been recorded in the
literature that the DCNP can be used as an excellent anticorrosive
and mechanical property promoter in organic coating formulations.23,24 Despite these attractive advantages, the application of DCNP in
food packaging and investigation of the functional properties related
to this area are still remain unknown. Thus, in this study, a cationic
dye, methylene blue (MB), was interconnected to a commercial organoclay,
Cloisite 20A (C20A), through a cationic exchange reaction (CER) for
synthesizing the dye–clay nanopigment (DCNP). PLA–DCNP
and PLA–C20A nanocomposite films at various filler loadings
were fabricated using the solution casting technique. The morphological,
mechanical, barrier, and optical properties of prepared nancomposite
films were comprehensively studied. Particular emphasis was given
to explore the possibility of using PLA–DCNP nanocomposite
films in food packaging applications.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of DCNP
The elemental analysis results
of C20A and DCNP are detailed in Table 1. The results showed the presence of 0 g and 1.1 g
of sulfur per 100 g of C20A and DCNP, respectively. Owing to the fact
that each molecule of MB contains one sulfur atom the quantity of
MB in 100 g of DCNP was calculated to be 35 mmol. By dividing the
MB content of DCNP (i.e., 35 mmol/100 g DCNP) by the initial mole
of MB in CER (i.e., 46 mmol/100 g C20A), the CER yield between the
clay and dye was found to be 0.76. The amount of dimethyl dihydrogenated
tallow ammonium chloride (2M2HT) in C20A before CER with MB was determined
to be 65 mmol/100 g clay, which was lower than that reported by the
manufacturer. Similar observations were reported by other studies.25−27 After the CER, the concentration of 2M2HT fell to 44 mmol/100 g
DCNP, confirming the replacement of the organic modifier with MB.
Generally, cationic dyes due to some chemical factors concerned with
their chemical structures have much higher binding strength for CER
with clays compared to that for alkylammonium ions. The presence of
resonance, donor heteroatoms, and polar moieties in the structure
of MB, as well as its planar chemical structure, can explain this
phenomenon. The first three mentioned factors in MB structure promote
dipolar interactions such as hydrogen bonding between MB and clay;
hence, MB has more affinity to be inserted in clay layers compared
to the organic ammonium modifier. Additionally, the planarity of MB
leads to efficient penetrating and packing of the dye into the clay
gallery.28−31 The higher total concentration of the intercalants in DCNP (the
total amount of 2MTHT and MB was 79 mmol/100 g DCNP) than that in
C20A (the total amount of 2MTHT was 65 mmol/100 g C20A) suggested
the nonstoichiometric exchange of 2M2TH and MB in CER. It seems that
the replacement of such a bulky organic modifier with two long hydrogenated
tallow chains provides more available negative sites and space in
clay layers for MB.

Morphology
of PLA films
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of C20A and DCNP are presented in Figure 1. An intense reflection peak at 2θ
= 3.46° in the diffraction pattern of C20A corresponds to a d-spacing value of 2.55 nm. After CER between C20A and MB,
the reflection peak experienced a shift from its original position
toward a higher angle, 2θ = 3.84°, with a d-spacing value of 2.30 nm that can be ascribed to the replacement
of the bulky organic modifiers with the smaller dye and molecular
reorientation of organic compounds inside clay layers.20,32 The reflection peaks disappeared after incorporating 3 wt % C20A
and 1, 3, and 5 wt % DCNP in PLA at different loading concentrations.
However, a broad shoulder at around 2θ = 2° with a d-spacing value of 4.40 nm was observed for the films containing
3 wt % C20A and 5 wt % DCNP. These observations suggest the simultaneous
existence of exfoliated or disordered intercalated platelets through
the polymer matrix. By comparing PLA films filled with C20A and DCNP
at an equal concentration (i.e., 3 wt %), it was observed that the
shoulder is more intense for C20A, which could be attributed to better
delamination of DCNP in the PLA matrix compared to that of C20A. The
interaction of ester functional groups in PLA chains with polar substituents
of MB can enhance the compatibility of DCNP with PLA and results in
more uniform dispersion of DCNP compared to that of C20A.33−37 Visual investigation of DCNP dispersion in PLA was performed by
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to precisely
depict the dispersion state and support XRD findings. The micrograph
of PLA–DCNP3 at low magnifications (Figure 2A) only showed random dispersion of variously
sized DCNP tactoids in the PLA matrix. Noted that dark lines in Figure 2 show DCNP platelets
through the light gray PLA matrix. However, at high magnifications
(Figure 2B,C), the
presence of individual DCNP platelets (black arrows) and intercalated
DCNP tactoids with ordered/disordered morphology (red arrows) through
the polymer background was discernible. These observations suggest
partially intercalated and exfoliated morphology of the DCNP/PLA sample,
which is in good agreement with XRD results.

DCNP, and PLA films filled with C20A and
DCNP at 1, 3, and 5 wt %.

to the exfoliated and intercalated clay platelets, respectively.

Dynamic Mechanical Properties of PLA Films
Figure 3A,B displays
the
temperature dependence of storage modulus (E′)
and tan δ of the samples. The values of E′ at 20 °C, glass transition temperature (Tg), and the intensity of tan δ peak for the
samples are detailed in Table 2. After the incorporation of 1 and 3 wt % DCNP in PLA, the
storage modulus of PLA increased from 1800 MPa to 2139 (19%) and 2157
(20%), respectively, which demonstrated the reinforcing effect of
DCNP in the PLA matrix. The formation of intercalated/exfoliated morphology
enhances the interfacial interactions between PLA molecular chains
and DCNP layers. Consequently, the imposed stress on PLA chains can
be effectively suppressed by rigid and high aspect ratio clay nanosheets
of DCNP. However, further incorporation of DCNP up to 5 wt % in PLA
resulted in a deterioration of the storage modulus. The formation
of aggregates and a decrease in the extent of intercalation/exfoliation
of DCNP at high filler contents can explain the observed results.
The temperature for the maximum value of tan δ represents
the glass transition temperature of the samples. As can be seen from Figure 3B, the tan δ
peak for the neat PLA occurred at 64 °C and shifted to higher
temperatures with values between 1 and 12 °C after the incorporation
of the fillers. These results may be explained by the fact that the
dispersed clay layers in the PLA matrix can decrease the free volume
and hinder the segmental motions of PLA molecular chains at the interface,
thus leading to an increase in glass transition temperature.38−41 With the addition of the fillers in the PLA matrix, a drop in the
intensity of the tan δ peak was observed for the samples,
and this decrement was more amplified for DCNP and at higher filler
concentrations. Generally, a decrease in the intensity of the tan δ
peak reflects a lower degree of polymer chain mobility.42−45 Embedding high aspect ratio DCNP layers in the PLA matrix even at
lower concentrations causes a strong interaction between two the components,
restricting polymer chain motions. It is worth noting that PLA–DCNP
films displayed higher E′ and Tg values compared to those of neat PLA and filled PLA
with C20A, which implied the excellent performance of DCNP in improving
the dynamic mechanical properties. Additionally, the higher values
of Tg for PLA–DCNP films compared
to that of the neat PLA film showed a favorable effect of DCNP on
PLA thermal stability. PLA with low Tg values ranging from 55 to 65 °C unlike other commonly used
food packaging materials with high Tg values
such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (Tg = 67–81 °C) and polystyrene (Tg = 70–115 °C) is technically limited to be used
in thermally processed packages.46−49 If Tg of the applied thermoplastic in food packaging is low (somewhere
in the vicinity of its application temperature), that packaging will
be in or close to its rubbery state and will have low mechanical strength.
Consequently, it will be vulnerable and will easily lose its dimensional
stability, particularly in more severe circumstances when such material
as a container is exposed to hot foodstuffs in different heat treatments
such as pasteurization and cooking. Moreover, due to the high mobility
of the polymer molecules in the rubbery state, the immigration of
the packaging materials from the matrix and contamination of foodstuffs
would be more probable. Accordingly, to avoid such drawbacks, it is
necessary for the material to have a Tg adequately higher than the application temperature. A specific example
in which the application temperature is lower than the glass transition
temperature of PLA–DCNP films (up to 76 °C) is mild-temperature
pasteurization of water, milk, juice, and beer that is usually performed
in the temperature range of 60–75 °C.

Barrier Properties of PLA Films
Oxygen permeability
(OP) and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the films are depicted
in Figure 4. As can
be seen from the figure, OP and WVP of PLA plummet by 36 and 54% after
addition of 1 and 3 wt % DCNP. These significant improvements in barrier
properties of PLA can fulfill the requirements in terms of permeability
to expand PLA applications in food packaging materials.50,51 The improvement of barrier properties of PLA after incorporation
of DCNP can be explained by the Nielsen tortuous path model.52−54 In fact, well-dispersed DCNP layers as barrier shields lengthen
the diffusion pathway of oxygen and water vapor through the PLA matrix
and decrease the gas and water vapor permeability of PLA.55−59 Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is the nucleating
effect of clay. The clay platelets as a nucleating agent for crystallization
of PLA lead to the formation of a more crystalized structure with
higher barrier properties.60−64 At higher DCNP contents, the PLA film endured 17 and 7% deterioration
for OP and WVP, respectively, likely ascribed to the formation of
some DCNP aggregates enlarging the quantity of preferential pathways
for permeant species. Comparing PLA films at the same loading level
of the fillers, it was found that DCNP has more effective performance
in the enhancement of barrier properties of PLA compared to that of
C20A, which may be attributed to the better dispersion of DCNP within
the PLA matrix as previously discussed.

and water vapor permeability (WVP) of
the PLA films.

Optical Properties of PLA
Films
Color coordinates over
the white tile in the CIELAB 1976 space, ΔE*, and contrast ratio for the samples are summarized in Table 3. As can be seen from
the table, b* values, expressing the blue-yellow
component of the samples, shifted from −4.0 for the neat PLA
up to −29.1 for DCNP/PLA. The values of a*,
indicating the green-red component of the samples, remained almost
constant. These results quantitatively illustrated that the DCNP/PLA
samples represented an obvious blue hue. The L* value
is representative of two optical properties of the samples at the
same time. The first property is the samples’ lightness, and
the second one is attributed to the transparency of them, which leads
to better light transmittance through the films and smaller changes
on the high lightness of the white substrate. L*
values progressively dropped from 91.8 for the neat PLA to 31.2 for
the DCNP/PLA films. The high lightness of the neat PLA is due to its
colorless and relatively clear appearance that leads to easy light
transmittance, therefore negligibly affecting the white substrate
color coordinates. On the other hand, low lightness of the DCNP containing
samples is attributed to the intense selective light absorption and
strong blue color of them, which hinder light transmittance and effectively
hide the white substrate. Addition of 1 and 3 wt % DCNP in the PLA
matrix resulted in a large ΔE* with the values
of 32.6 and 62.1, respectively. A further increase of DCNP concentration
up to 5 wt % showed a negligible increase in ΔE* (i.e., approximately 2 units, it is worth noting that this small
color difference between PLA–DCNP3 and PLA–DCNP5 is
almost indistinguishable by the human vision system), reflecting that
the hue was saturated at lower loading levels of the colorant. These
findings highlighted that the PLA–DCNP film due to its excellent
color performance is capable of providing a specific shade with less
consumption of colorants, which is more economic. The contrast ratio
of neat PLA was found to be 13.6 and considerably rose to 58.2 after
addition of 5 wt % DCNP in the PLA matrix. At the identical concentration
of DCNP and C20A (i.e., 3 wt %), an increase in contrast ratio was
found to be more pronounced for DCNP. These observations revealed
that DCNP provided much higher hiding power and light protection performance
for food packaging materials compared to those of the organoclay. Figure 5A,B illustrates the
transmittance spectra of the PLA films in UVB (280–320 nm)
and UVA (320–400 nm) regions. As shown in Figure 5A, a neat PLA film with a thickness
of 100 μm showed an average UV transmittance of 23%, suggesting
a relatively transparent film susceptible to UV light diffusion. Filling
PLA with DCNP and C20A substantially dropped UV transmittance of PLA
in a way that at 3–5 wt % of filler contents the samples represented
no UV transmittance, reflecting remarkable UV protection performance
of PLA–DCNP samples. To get further insight into the effect
of fillers on UV resistance properties of PLA, UV–vis spectrophotometry
was also performed on the samples with a thickness of 10 μm,
and the results are displayed in Figure 5B. As can be seen, the neat PLA film with
a thickness of 10 μm has an average transmittance of 90% in
the wavelength range of 280–400 nm, which allowed most of the
incident UVA and UVB rays to pass that means high transparency and
poor UV protection performance of this sample. When fillers were added
to PLA, however, the average transmittance values drastically decreased
to 29–60% for PLA–DCNP samples and 42% for PLA–C20A
samples. Such a substantial decrease in UV transmittance by only a
10 μm film indicated superior UV radiation barrier properties
of filled PLA. However, from the figure, it was found that the UV
opacity of PLA–DCNP was slightly better than that of PLA–C20A
at an equal filler concentration. Two possible mechanisms can be proposed
to explain the high UV protection performance of PLA–DCNP samples.
High aspect ratio aluminosilicate platelets of DCNP as an appropriate
protective shield in the PLA matrix can hinder the UV diffusion pathway.
Furthermore, a part of UV beams can be absorbed or suppressed by the
interaction of electromagnetic radiation with polar moieties of methylene
blue and clay platelets.16,20,65,66 The high UV and visible light
blocking performance of obtained PLA–DCNP films, comparable
to that of polymer films containing different additives, enable use
of PLA–DCNP films for packaging of many UV and visible light
sensitive foods such as meat, vegetable oils, milk, and dairy products.16,65,67−70 It is worth mentioning that the
durability (i.e., color fastness) of the nanopigment under the continuous
intense UV exposure was found to be desirable in our previous studies.20,24

Conclusions
Colored biodegradable/biocompatible PLA nanocomposite films containing
1–5 wt % of dye–clay hybrid nanopigment (DCNP) were
fabricated using a simple solution casting approach for application
in food packaging materials. DCNP was successfully synthesized with
a reaction yield of 76% via a cationic exchange reaction (CER) between
a cationic dye (MB) and organically modified montmorillonite (C20A).
The morphological studies of PLA–DCNP films showed the coexistence
of the intercalated and exfoliated structure of DCNP/PLA nanocomposite
films. It was also found a more uniform dispersion of DCNP within
the PLA matrix compared to that of C20A. With the inclusion of DCNP
in the PLA matrix, the dynamic mechanical properties, including storage
modulus (E′) and glass transition temperature
(Tg), were greatly improved. The highest
improvement in E′ and Tg was obtained at 3 wt % of DCNP loading level, while increasing
the DCNP concentration to 5 wt % deteriorated the storage modulus
of PLA. Oxygen permeability (OP) and water vapor permeability (WVP)
of PLA–DCNP films were found to be much lower (i.e., 36% for
OP and 54% for WVP) than those of neat PLA. These values also were
higher than those of PLA–C20A at the same filler concentration.
Optical property investigation of the samples revealed excellent color
performance (high color strength and hiding power) and visible light
protection properties of PLA–DCNP, especially at 3 wt %. UV
protection performance of PLA–DCNP films with a sample thickness
of 100 μm was found to be 100% and slightly higher than that
of PLA–C20A. Overall, the presented results signified that
the colored PLA–DCNP film with excellent functional properties
(i.e., high mechanical strength, barrier properties, blocking effect
against destructive radiation, and biodegradability of the applied
polymeric matrix) are well qualified to be potentially employed in
food packaging applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
A film-grade
polylactic acid, Ingeo biopolymer
4032D, was purchased from NatureWorks Co. Ltd. The selected grade
is a semicrystalline PLA designed for use in the production of food
packaging materials according to the manufacturer’s data sheet.
A commercial montmorillonite organoclay, Cloisite 20A, modified with
a bulky quaternary ammonium salt (dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium
chloride, 2M2HT) and a modifier concentration of 95 mmol/100 g clay
was supplied by BYK Additives, Germany. Analytical-grade chloroform,
ethanol, hydrochloric acid, and methylene blue were obtained from
Merck GmbH, Germany.

Synthesis of DCNP
Cloisite 20A,
C20A, (10 g) was suspended
into 500 mL of mixture of water/ethanol with a volumetric ratio of
25:75 using a magnetic stirrer under a stirring speed of 600 rpm for
12 h at ambient temperature. Methylene blue, MB, at a quantity equal
to 46 mmol/100 clay (i.e., 50% of clay cationic exchange capacity,
CEC = 92 mequiv/100 g clay) was dissolved in 200 mL of 0.1 M HCl.
The dye solution was gently added to the stirring clay suspension,
and then, the resultant mixture was stirred for 24 h at the same condition
to complete the cationic exchange reaction between the clay and dye.
Subsequently, the solid product was separated by filtration and washed
with excess of distilled water. The filtrate was dried in vacuum at
60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the dried filtered cake was ground and
sieved to obtain fine DCNP powder. Noted that, as previously stated,
the optimum initial concentration of MB in CER, in which the resulting
DCNP represents best functional properties along with an acceptable
reaction yield, is 50% of clay CEC.23

Preparation of PLA Films
To prepare PLA films containing
C20A and DCNP, 1 g of PLA was first dissolved in 20 mL of chloroform
using a magnetic stirrer under a stirring speed of 600 rpm for 2 h
at ambient temperature. Then, the determined amounts of C20A and DCNP,
based on Table 4, were
slowly added into the PLA solution. The mixtures were stirred for
2 h followed by a sonication process using a Hielscher UP400S ultrasonic
sonicator, Germany, at a power of 50 W for 30 min. The dispersions
were cast on a glass Petri dish and allowed to evaporate the solvent
at ambient temperature for 48 h. The obtained films were finally dried
in vacuum at 40 °C for 48 h to ensure complete evaporation of
the residual solvent. The thicknesses of the final films were measured
to be 100 ± 5 μm using a digital micrometer, Absolute Digimatic
547–401, Mitutoyo, Japan. The measurements were repeated on
10 random locations over the surface of each film.

Characterization
Characterization of DCNP
Elemental analysis was performed
to determine the reaction yield and the quantity of 2M2HT and MB in
DCNP using a PerkinElmer 2400 series II CHNS/O elemental analyzer.
By determining the mass percentage of sulfur in DCNP, the amount of
MB reacted with clay was calculated. Then, the amount of 2M2HT between
clay layers was calculated by subtracting the nitrogen content attributed
to MB from the total nitrogen content of DCNP.

Morphology of PLA Films
The extent of intercalation
and exfoliation of fillers in PLA was quantitatively and qualitatively
examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques, respectively. XRD patterns
were collected at scattering angles from 0.5 to 10° with a scanning
rate of 0.02°/s on a Philips X’Pert MPD X-ray generator
(tube Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å) at room temperature. The
basal spacing of samples (d-spacing) was calculated
using the Bragg equation. HRTEM micrographs of the PLA film filled
with 3 wt % of DCNP (PLA–DCNP3 was the sample that showed the
optimum properties) were obtained by an FEI Tecnai F20 with an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV. The cross section of the sample was generated under
cryogenic conditions using a Leica EM UC7 ultra-microtome equipped
with a diamond knife.

Dynamic Mechanical Properties of PLA Films
The dynamic
mechanical properties of the films were investigated using a Mettler
Toledo DMA 1 dynamic mechanical analyzer. The experiments were carried
out on 30 × 10 × 0.1 mm3 dimension specimens
under tension mode at a scanning temperature range of 25–120
°C with a temperature ramp of 5 °C/min and frequency of
1 Hz.

Gas and Water Vapor Permeability of PLA Films
Oxygen
permeability (OP) of the PLA films was evaluated using a Brugger Feinmechanik
GmbH GDP-C gas permeability tester at 25 ± 1 °C and 45 ±
5% relative humidity (RH) according to ASTM D 1434. Briefly, the samples
were clamped and sealed between two metallic chambers. The permeating
gas was pumped toward the PLA films in a chamber with a higher gas
pressure. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the samples was indicated
by monitoring the increase in gas pressure at another chamber with
a lower gas pressure. Finally, the OP of the samples is calculated
using eq 1 1  where OTR, L, and Δp are the oxygen transmission
rate, film thickness, and
difference in partial pressure of the gas on the two sides of the
film, respectively. A dish method was used to determine the water
vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples as described by ASTM E 96.
The test samples were attached and sealed to an aluminum cup with
a mouth area of 30 cm2 containing a specific amount of
distilled water. The assemblies were placed at 25 ± 1 °C
and 45 ± 5% RH and weighed every 6 h for 14 days. The weight
change as a function of time was plotted for each sample. The WVP
of the samples is calculated using eq 2 2  where G and t are
weight change and time at the steady-state region of the plot,
respectively, and A, x, and Δp are the cup mouth area, film thickness, and the water
vapor pressure difference between two sides of the film, respectively.

Optical Properties of PLA Films
Color coordinates of
the samples were determined according to the CIELAB color scale under
the D65 standard illuminant over a standard white tile (L* = 82.3, a* = −0.1, and b* = −0.6) using a GretagMacbeth Color Eye 7000A spectrophotometer.
The instrument was adjusted in 8/d geometry and specular component
included mode. The color differences (ΔE*)
between the neat and filled PLA samples are measured using eq 3 3  The contrast ratio
(CW) of the PLA films was obtained to
study their visible light
protection performance according to ASTM D 2805. Briefly, the reflectance
of the films was measured over the one above standard white tile and
a standard black tile (L* = 3.4, a* = −0.2, and b* = −1.2). Then, the CW of samples is calculated using eq 4 4  where Ro and Rw are the sample reflectance (Y-tristimulus value) over the black tile and white tile, respectively.
UV–vis transmittance spectra of the samples were recorded using
a Jenway 6715 UV–vis spectrophotometer over the wavelength
range from 280 to 400 nm covering UVA and UVB regions to study the
effect of DCNP on UV protection performance of PLA. Note that it was
not possible to investigate the effect of filler type and concentration
on the UV blocking performance of the filled samples at high thicknesses
(100 ± 5 μm) as these samples with such thick media were
capable of absorbing/scattering all UV radiation in 280–400
nm (zero transmittance in 280–400 nm) even at low filler concentrations.
Therefore, to make a tangible comparison, UV–vis tests were
also performed on 10 μm-thick films to magnify the difference
between transmittance spectra of the samples in the UV region and
to highlight the UV blocking effect of the nanofillers.
