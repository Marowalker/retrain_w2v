Several
computational techniques for solid-state applications have
recently been proposed to enlarge the scope of computer simulations
of large molecular systems. In this contribution, we focused on two
of these, namely, HF-3c and PBEh-3c. They were recently proposed by
the Grimme’s group, as “low-cost” ab initio-based
techniques for electronic structure calculation of large systems and
were proved to be effective essentially for organic molecules. HF-3c
is based on a Hartree–Fock Hamiltonian with a minimal Gaussian
quality basis set, whereas PBEh-3c is a density functional theory
(DFT) based method with a hybrid functional and a medium-quality basis
set. Both HF-3c and PBEh-3c account for dispersion (London) interactions
and are free from the basis set superposition error due to limited
basis set size, through several pairwise semiempirical corrections.
To the best of our knowledge, despite the promising results on the
cost-accuracy side of molecular simulations of organic molecules,
these methods have been used only in few cases for solid-state applications.
In this contribution, we studied the performance of HF-3c and PBEh-3c
for predicting the properties of inorganic crystals to enlarge the
applicability of these cheap and fast methodologies. As a testing
ground, we have chosen a well-known class of material, e.g., microporous
all-silica zeolites. We benchmarked geometries, formation energies,
vibrational features, and mechanical properties by comparing the results
with literature data from both experiment and computer simulation.
For structures, HF-3c is extremely accurate in predicting the zeolites
cell volume, albeit we do not include any vibrational contribution,
neither zero point nor thermal, on the computed volumes, which may
introduce small variations in the predicted values. For the energetic,
the relative stability of the zeolites using the DFT//HF-3c approach
allows predictions within the experimental error for most of the cases
taken into consideration when the experimental enthalpies were corrected
back to electronic energies by using the HF-3c thermodynamic contributions
computed in the harmonic approximation. This strategy is particularly
convenient, as the slow step (geometry optimization) is carried out
with the cheapest HF-3c method, whereas the fast step (single point
energy evaluation) is carried out with costly DFT methods. In this
sense, the use of the DFT//HF-3c approach results to be a promising
one to predict the stability and structure of microporous materials.
Finally, the HF-3c method predicts the mechanical properties of the
zeolite set in reasonable agreement with respect to those computed
with the state-of-the-art DFT simulations, indicating the HF-3c method
as a possible technique for the mechanical stability screenings of
microporous materials.

Introduction
In last years, we have
witnessed the development of several computational
techniques for solid-state (SS) applications that enlarged the possibility
of computer simulations in this research field. Various wave-function-based
approaches, earlier available for molecular systems only, docked on
SS realm. Nowadays, we can use the golden standard for molecular simulation,
e.g., coupled cluster with a full treatment singles and doubles, for
systems with periodic boundary conditions, albeit with very large
cost and small system size.1−3 Moreover, the simulation of solids
within the second-order Moller–Plesset approximation (MP2)4 can be done routinely, albeit with serious limitations
in terms of geometry optimization.5,6 Furthermore,
recent advances in accuracy and speed-up of the diffusion quantum
Monte Carlo have appeared in recent work.7 The above method includes electron correlation in a formally correct
manner. Therefore, they are accurate but computationally expensive,
with a narrow range of applicability in material science, particularly
as far as the system size is concerned, limiting their applicability
to complex and more challenging systems.

For a routine simulation,
a SS scientist can rely on density functional
theory (DFT), in which electron correlation is included in the exchange
and correlation potential (UXC). In its
simpler expression, it depends linearly on the electron density, but
the accuracy of this flavor of DFT is not enough for chemical applications.
Introducing the density gradient and/or part of exact Hartree–Fock
(HF) exchange into UXC increases the accuracy
of DFT, and it can be applied for a variety of problems of chemical
nature.8−10 Including also the description of dispersion forces,11 DFT simulation can reach in some cases, with
a precise choice of parameters, the celebrated “chemical accuracy”.12

Faster alternatives to DFT are semiempirical
(SE) methods, which
are based on highly approximated HF Hamiltonians, thus enlarging dramatically
the investigable system size. Successful examples of these methodologies
are the PM6 method,13 along with the available
refinements for an accurate description of H bonding and dispersion
forces (PM6-D3H4)14 and for halogenated
systems PM6-D3H4,15 as well as the more
recent PM7.16 Very recently, a semiempirical
tight binding (TB) method for the noncovalently large bonded systems
has been proposed, e.g., geometry, frequency, noncovalent, extended
TB.17 Unfortunately, to date, it is coded
for molecular system only. In general, SE methods are not accurate
enough when compared to standard DFT simulations as, for systems outside
the molecular training set, they may experience large errors in the
computed properties.

Recently, Grimme’s group proposed
a “low-cost”
ab initio-based technique for electronic structure calculations that
lies between the DFT and SE methods. Called HF-3c,18 the method is based on a Hartree–Fock (HF) calculation
with a minimal Gaussian-type basis set (MINIX). Thanks to three-atom
pairwise semiempirical corrections, it exhibits the following features:
(i) it is mainly free of basis set superposition error,19 (ii) it accounts for dispersion (London) interactions,20 (iii) it correctly computes the interatomic
distances, despite the adopted minimal basis set.18 Later on, three other members joined the family of the
“3c” methods, e.g., PBEh-3c,21,22 HSE-3c,21 and B97-3c.23 The PBEh-3c and HSE-3c methods are DFT-based methods with
a hybrid functional and a double zeta Gaussian-type basis set quality.
Conversely, the B97-3c is a generalised gradient approximation (GGA)
functional with a larger triple zeta with one polarization function
(TZP) basis set. To the best of our knowledge, this promising 3c method
family has only been applied to organic molecular systems in gas phase,
solution, and solid state to date.5,18,19,21−25 Our aim is to check the range of applicability of these methodologies
up to the broad class of inorganic and composite materials.

In this contribution, we focused on two representative methods
for this low-cost class of methods, e.g., HF-3c and PBEh-3c, to investigate
several inorganic crystalline materials. As a benchmark for inorganic
systems, a well-known class of materials, e.g., microporous materials,
was chosen. We considered a set of pure silica zeolites recently studied
by Román-Román et al.26 Zeolites
have found a widespread use in the field of catalysis, gas separation,
and ion exchange.27 Therefore, being able
to model their features has important consequence in terms of applications.

We have relaxed the geometry and computed the relative stability
and the mechanical properties of a set of zeolites. Our theoretical
findings are compared with experiments and previously published theoretical
values where available. We have also tested the dispersion-corrected
density functional theory (DFT-D)//HF-3c-027 recipe in which the energy
is estimated at the DFT-D level on the geometry relaxed with a revised
version of the HF-3c approach. This approach was proven to be cost-effective
for computing energies and geometries of molecular crystals5 and protein conformations.28

Results and Discussion
Zeolite is a family of crystals
with a microporous structure. Pure
silica zeolites (SiO2 polymorphs) can have a potential
infinity variety of tetra-coordinated open-framework arrangements,
with α-quartz as the thermodynamically most stable polymorph.
In this contribution, we considered 15 silica polymorphs, e.g., a
set of 14 zeolites and the α-quartz crystal, see Figure 1.

polymorphs studied in this work. Only the
Si framework is shown.

Unit Cell Volume Analysis
We have fully relaxed the
cell and internal parameters of all sets with plain and scaled HF-3c
and PBEh-3c methods by exploiting in full the crystal symmetry. As
a comparison, we reported also the results of the PBE0-D2/VTZP and
B3LYP-D2/VTZP methods, taken from ref (26). As a comparison with the hybrid DFT functionals
taken from literature, we also tested the performances of the pure
GGA PBE-D2/VTZP method.

The percentage deviation of the computed
cell volumes with respect to experiments is graphically reported in Figure 2. The HF-based methods
outperform the DFT ones. Indeed, both plain and scaled HF-3c methods
are in very good agreement with the experiments. The mean absolute
percentage error (MARE) computed for the HF-3c and the HF-3c-027 methods
is 2.1 and 1.9%, respectively (see Table 2). The standard deviation (SD) in both cases
is 2.3%. Conversely, the best-performing DFT-based method, e.g., PBEh-3c,
has only a MARE of 4.4% with a SD of 3.9%. Interestingly, the general
trend in the volume prediction seems to correlate with the percentage
of HF exchange in the functional definition. Indeed, the mean relative
error (MRE) has the following trend Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) > B3LYP > PBE0 > PBEh-3c > HF (Table 1), in line with the increment
of the exchange
HF percentage, which is 0, 20, 25, 42, and 100%, respectively.

The theoretical framework (electronic energy relaxation) used to
estimate the unit cell volume does not include any vibrational contribution,
neither zero point nor thermal. The results obtain in such away are
compared to the experimental data collected at room temperature (RT).
To have a fair comparison between theory and experiments, one should
quantify the effect of vibrations (at RT) on the unit cell volume
size predicted by electronic energy relaxation. For that purpose,
a quasi harmonic approximation (QHA) as implemented in CRYSTAL17 can
be used. Unfortunately, QHA simulations are extremely costly, as they
consist of a series of geometry optimizations at constant volume followed
by frequency calculations. Therefore, we explicitly run QHA for α-quartz
only using the PBE/VTZP-D2 level of theory. The unit cell volume change
is about +1.4%. For zeolites, we relied on literature data run with
force fields specifically derived for silica materials. Gale reported
a cell volume contraction at T = 200 K for zeolite-A
of 0.63%, whereas Faujasite reported even smaller value.29 In a similar study, the volume variation in
the T = 50–300 K range was computed to be
−0.36% for zeolite-L, 0.39% for cancrinite, 0.31% for zeolite-X,
and 0.06% (from 20 to 296 K) for experimental measurement on Al-exchanged
zeolite-X.30 As one can see, for zeolites,
the expansion can also be negative as a function of the framework.
Due to the very small absolute variation, we do not believe this effect
will alter the main conclusion of the present work, as variations
in volume as a function of adopted Hamiltonian are larger than the
thermal effect.

Thermodynamic Stability
The enthalpy
of formation (ΔH) of a material is the sum
of three energy differences
(with respect to the reference), e.g., electronic, vibrational zero
point (ZPE), and thermal effect. Therefore, we corrected the experimental
ΔH (298.15 K)31,32 with vibrational
ZPE and thermal energies computed at the HF-3c-027 level, thus obtaining
a “quasi-experimental electronic energies of formation”
directly comparable with the computed electronic energies. We scaled
the HF-3c-027 (full IR spectra are reported in Figure S2) frequencies by 0.8707 (which affects the ZPE only).
This factor minimizes the RMSD of HF-3c-027 frequencies with respect
to those computed at the B3LYP/SVP-D* level for the α-quartz
case. Interestingly, the applied scaling factor is very similar to
the one recommended (0.87) in the original HF-3c publication.18 The HF-3c-027 ZPE and thermal energy sum is
similar for all zeolites, e.g., 2.3 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit (ME ± SD). Therefore, we propose to
subtract 2.3 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit as
a simple and general procedure to compute “quasi-experimental
ΔE” from the experimental ΔH values.

We have graphically resumed the computed
energy of formation of the zeolite set in Figure 3 and compared it with the “quasi-experimental
energy” of formations. A comprehensive statistical analysis
is reported in Table 2. All energetic data are fully reported in Table S4. In contrast with the cell volume estimation,
the HF-based methods are not as good for energy evaluation, see Figure 4A. They are not accurate
nor precise, with a large value of SD, e.g., 2.4/2.5 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit. The compared full DFT approaches differ
only for the functional type, using the same basis set (VTZP) and
dispersion correction (D2). Among them, the most accurate is PBE0
with a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 4.9 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit, see Figure 3B. Interestingly, all of them have a small SD value
of maximum 1.7 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit
(PBE method, see Table 2).

The high accuracy/cost
ratio of the HF-3c-027 method for cell volume
estimation suggests the use of HF-3c-027 as a substitute of DFT in
the geometry optimization procedure. Relaxing the structure is the
rate-determining step in these static simulations, and the use of
the faster HF-3c method leads to a notable speed-up.5 Coupling HF-3c-027 method for geometry relaxation and DFT
for the energy estimation (DFT-D//HF-3c-027 recipe, hereafter labeled
as SP-DFT-D) is a methodology that gave excellent results for computing
the energetics of molecular crystals and protein models.5,28

Unfortunately, in terms of accuracy, the SP-B3LYP-D approach
is
strongly dependent on both dispersion scheme used in the energy estimation
(-D) and the basis set quality, see Table 2 and Figure 3C,D. Regarding the dispersion scheme, we have tested
two dispersion corrections coupled with the B3LYP functional, e.g.,
D* and D3ABC, see Figure 3C. The SP-B3LYP/SVP-D* method is much more accurate,
with a MAE of 3.7 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit.
Conversely, the SP-B3LYP/SVP-D3ABC method gives a higher
MAE of 7.3 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit. The
bad performance of the D3ABC scheme can be explained by
the overstabilization of the denser α-quartz phase with respect
to the porous zeolites. For that purpose, we have plotted the dispersion
energy vs density of SiO2 group for the zeolite set (see Figure 4). The slope of the
regression line is almost twice as large for D3ABC with
respect the D* one. Noticeable is the negligible contribution of the
three-body correction. As expected, the role of the dispersion interaction
is higher for denser structures, up to the maximum for α-quartz.

Within the SP-DFT-D recipe, using a larger basis set for the DFT
energy estimation stabilizes the zeolite with respect to the α-quartz
phase. This effect has already been seen in ref (26). This leads to results
that are in very good agreement with the experiments. Indeed, for
the SP-B3LYP/VTZP-D*, the calculated MAE and SD are 0.81 and 0.87
kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit, see Figure 3D. This method predicts
the zeolite “quasi-experimental energy of formation”
within the experimental error in most of the cases (9 out of 14).
Similar level of accuracy is achieved using the PBEh-3c as well as
the PBE/VTZP-D3ABC methods as DFT method for the energy
estimation (SP-PBEh-3c and SP-PBE/VTZP-D3ABC methods),
see Table 2 and Figure 3D.

In the case
of the SP-PBE/VTZP-D method, the simulations corrected
by the D3ABC dispersion scheme give better results than
those corrected by the D2 scheme (Table 2). By the analysis of the dispersion energy
vs density curve, see Figure S1, we see
that the slope of the regression line is similar between the D3ABC scheme and the D2 one.

The accuracy of the energy
of formation is very important for studying
the experimental feasibility of synthesis of a given silica framework.
This has been considered through the analysis of the MAE statistical
function. Parallelly, we also carried out the analysis of the Pearson
coefficient. It indicates the goodness of the linear correlation between
experimental and theoretical data, see Table 2. In most of the cases, the theoretical methods
employed have a good correlation with the experimental data. This
suggests the capability of the selected method of predicting, with
fair accuracy, the right stability ranking of an all-silica zeolite
set.

Mechanical Stability
To tighten the comparison between
different methods, we have predicted the second-order elastic properties
of 9 out of 14 frameworks of the zeolite set at the HF-3c level of
theory. The mechanical properties of the chosen zeolites have already
been investigated in literature.33 From
the analysis of the elastic tensor, we have calculated and analyzed
the Young’s modulus (E) and shear modulus
(G) values. These two quantities are useful for characterizing
the stiffness of a material, and, therefore, they can be related to
the mechanical stability of the zeolites. Due to the anisotropic nature
of the crystals, E and G are directional
properties, thus assuming different values depending on the direction
within the crystal with respect to their evaluation. As we are only
interested in checking the performance of HF-3c method with respect
to the DFT reference values, we considered only the minimum and maximum
values assumed by E and G for all
zeolites. The reference values are computed by the B3LYP-D2/SVP method,
which were taken from ref (33). The comparison is reported in Figure 5, the statistical analysis is reported in Table S5, and all explicit values are reported
in Table S6.

Figure 5 Minimum (black dots)
and maximum (red dots) values for the Young’s
modulus (E) and shear modulus (G) of the zeolite set. HF-3c vs B3LYP-D2/SVP.33 Simple linear regressions (with equation and R2 factor) are included in the graph.

HF-3c tends to overestimate the stiffness of the zeolites
with
respect to B3LYP/SVP-D2, see Figure 5, with an increment of the minimum/maximum values for E and G of ≈20/30%, see Table S5. In general, E is computed
more precisely than G with an averaged SD of 11 and
20%, respectively, with respect to the DFT computed values. To correct
the HF-3c values, we propose a simple scaling factor to estimate E and G at the B3LYP/SVP-D2 level starting
from the HF-3c ones through a simple linear regression of HF-3c values
vs B3LYP/SVP-D2 ones (see Figure 5 equations).

We have also employed the HF-3c-027
method for computing the mechanical
properties. The results deviate more from the B3LYP/SVP-D2 one than
the plain HF-3c. This is not surprising, considering that the HF-3c-027
method performs badly in general in terms of energy estimation.5 With the scaled method, the E and G values are usually higher with respect to
plain HF-3c, see Figure S3.

Finally,
we have calculated the E and G anisotropies,
which are the difference between the maximum
and the minimum values for E and G, respectively. This quantity is usually employed as a qualitative
indicator of the mechanical stability of microporous crystalline materials.33−35 The anisotropy at the B3LYP/SVP-D2 level spans from 1 to 4. Interestingly,
the same range of anisotropy is computed using the HF-3c method.

Conclusions
In this work, we have reported the performance
of two recently
presented computational methods, e.g., HF-3c and PBEh-3c. The testing
ground is the prediction of the thermodynamic and mechanical stability
of all-silica zeolites. We have carried out a comparison with experiments
(when available) and standard DFT simulation (also taken from literature)
used as reference.

The first computational step to calculate
the thermodynamic and
mechanical stability of a crystalline material is the structure relaxation.
An outcome of this step is the prediction of the crystal cell volume.
In this regards, we have a clear indication of the excellent performance
of the HF-3c method. Indeed, it outperforms PBEh-3c and standard hybrid
DFT with a large basis set (from ref (26)), resulting in extremely high accuracy. In details,
the HF-3c-027 method computes the unit cell volumes with unsigned
percentage mean error (MARE) of 1.9% with respect to experiments.
The PBEh-3c method has a lower MARE of 4.4%, which is better than
that of standard hybrid DFT (MARE of 5.7% at least). Interestingly,
we notice an increasing accuracy in the volume prediction by increasing
the percentage of the HF exchange potential within the adopted Hamiltonian.
It should be stressed that due to the high cost of the calculations,
we did not include any vibrational contribution, neither zero point
nor thermal, on the computed volumes, which may introduce small variations
in the predicted values. Nonetheless, literature data based on classical
force fields developed for all-silica materials gave variations in
the unit cell volumes for selected zeolites within 1%. Therefore,
we think this effect will not affect the main conclusions of this
work.

Regarding zeolite thermodynamic stability, we used quasi-experimental
energy of formation as reference values. These data are obtained by
correcting back the experimental enthalpies of formation with respect
to α-quartz for the vibrational zero point and thermal energy
computed at HF-3c-027 level. We found this correction to be quite
constant across the set of zeolites (about 2.3 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit). In this way, we computed
quasi-experimental energies of formation spanning from 4 to 12 kJ
mol–1 per SiO2 unit. For the HF-3c methods,
we calculate a high mean unsigned error (MAE) of 5.9 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit at least. This is not surprising, as HF-3c
is known to be inaccurate for energy estimations.5,28 Conversely,
PBEh-3c does better but suffers from the relevant deviation on the
unit cell volume compared to experiments.

Mixing the HF-3c method
(for geometry optimization) with hybrid
DFT (for single point energy calculation), namely, SP-DFT-D, is an
excellent recipe to predict the thermodynamic stability of zeolites.
Using the B3LYP/VTZP-D* method for energies gives a MAE value of only
0.81 kJ mol–1 per SiO2 unit, well within
the experimental error for 9 out of 14 zeolites. Moreover, we noticed
that B3LYP simulation corrected for dispersion with the most recent
DFT-D correction, e.g., D3ABC scheme, overstabilizes the
dense α-quartz phase, thus destabilizing excessively the zeolites
set. This effect is mitigated when the PBE functional is employed.
This suggests the use of D* and D3ABC schemes coupled with
the B3LYP and PBE functionals, respectively, for theoretical works
on pure silica zeolites.

The SP-DFT-D approach is potentially
cheaper than the standard
DFT. Indeed, the computationally demanding procedures, e.g., geometry
optimization and vibrational frequencies estimations, are computed
with the faster HF-3c method. The slower hybrid DFT (with large basis
set) is used only for one single point energy calculation. The computational
cost of a SCF cycle plus atomic gradient follows this order: HF-3c
< B3LYP/SVP < PBEh-3c < B3LYP/VTZP. The speed-up factor of
HF-3c with respect to B3LYP/VTZP is up to 1 order of magnitude with
a much smaller footprint on the requested random-access memory. The
speed-up can be dramatically improved by a careful reparameterization
of the basis set of second-row elements in the context of solid-state
application. Our group is currently working on this topic, and preliminary
results indicate that the speed-up obtained for organic systems (HF-3c/(B3LYP/TZP)
= 1:∼40) is attainable also for crystals of inorganic nature
with properly cured basis sets.5,28

The calculation
at HF-3c of the Young (E) and
shear modulus (G) gives stiffer zeolites with respect
to the B3LYP-D* prediction. The average increment on E/G values is ≈20/30%. The E and G anisotropies, which give a rough estimation
of the mechanical stability of a material, are computed as the ratio
between Emax/Emin and Gmax/Gmin. Due to errors cancellation, HF-3c agrees with B3LYP, with predicted
anisotropies spanning from 1 to 4. This indicates HF-3c as a possible
method to perform mechanical stability screenings of microporous materials.

In perspective, the combination of the cost-effective HF-3c method
with the more accurate B3LYP/VTZP-D* one may also extend the possibility
to study the adsorption of molecules in zeolite pores.36 It can become an useful complementary tool for
experimentalists for locating metal doping37 or substitution sites in zeolites framework. In these cases, in
which usually the crystal symmetry is reduced, having a fast method
for computing geometry and vibrational frequencies is mandatory. The
accuracy of the energy estimation, ensured by using the DFT, allows
also to have reliable reaction barrier energies, as we demonstrated
in conformational changes of proteins.28 Another potential application, which will be the focus of future
work, will be the study of the relative stability of different sites
of protonation for Al-exchanged zeolites, which is relevant in catalysis.
The PBEh-3c method confirms a reasonably good performance also of
the inorganic materials. The results are in line with large basis
set hybrid DFT at a fraction of their cost.

Computational Methods
We computed relaxed geometries, energies, and vibrational frequencies
with a development version of the CRYSTAL14 code.38 Conversely, zeolite mechanical properties are run with
the latest release of the code, e.g., CRYSTAL17.39 The results obtained with the development version of CRYSTAL14
can now be reproduced with CRYSTAL17.

Simulations are run employing
the HF-3c18 and PBEh-3c22 methods, which are available
in the CRYSTAL code. Along with the plain HF-3c method, we also employed
a revised form of the method, namely, HF-3c-027.5 In the HF-3c-027 approach, the dipole–quadrupole
contribution of the D3 scheme is scaled by a factor of 0.27. With
this refinement, HF-3c-027 gave excellent results in computing protein
and molecular crystal structures, see refs (5) and (28).

Standard DFT simulations were run using the B3LYP
hybrid functional,9 corrected with a revised
version of the D2 dispersion
scheme, e.g., D*.40,41 B3LYP simulations are run also
with the most recent D3 scheme,20 including
the Axilrod–Teller–Muto-three-body-term (D3ABC).42,43 Also, pure GGA PBE functional has been employed,
being regularly applied in plane waves based codes. The PBE functional
has been coupled with the D2 dispersion scheme (scaled by a factor
of 0.75),9 and to the D3ABC scheme.
To estimate the volume expansion of the α-quartz, we used the
quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA keyword) as implemented in the CRYSTAL17
code, using default parameters beside the parameter step and points
set to 1.5 and 7, respectively, see ref (44). Due to the small cell size of the α-quartz,
the QHA calculation has been carried out on a super (1 × 1 ×
2) cell.

Atomic positions and cell vectors optimization adopted
the analytical
gradient method. The Hessian was upgraded with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
algorithm.45−47 We set tolerances for the convergence of the maximum
allowed gradient and the maximum atomic displacement to default values.
To help the convergence of the SCF, the Fock/KS matrix at a given
cycle was mixed with percentage from 30% up to 50% of the one of the
previous cycle.44 The recently introduced
direct inversion of the iterative subspace extrapolator technique
has been employed to speed up the SCF convergence.48,49 Details on the tolerance values controlling the Coulomb and exchange
series in periodic systems44 and the shrink
factor used in the calculations are reported in details in the Supporting Information. Regarding the shrinking
factor, a minimum shrinking factor of 2,2 was employed up to 6,6 depending
on the system. The zeolite mechanical properties were calculated employing
the default setup of the CRYSTAL17 code, besides the NUMDERIV parameter,
which is set to 5.44 For the vibrational
frequency calculations, the mass-weighted force-constant matrix was
computed at the Γ point by numerical derivative of the analytic
nuclear gradients. A value of 0.003 Å was chosen as the displacement
of each atomic coordinate. The IR intensity of each normal mode of
vibration was computed using the Berry phase approach.50 Tolerance (Hartree) on the energy convergence
is set to10–7 for single point energy calculations
and geometry optimizations

to 10–8 in mechanical property calculations
(as default)

to 10–11 in frequency calculations.



B3LYP calculations
were carried out using molecular all-electron
Gaussian basis sets. A split valence basis with polarized functions
(SVP) set of 8-411G(d) was chosen for O atoms and 88-31G(d) for Si
atoms.51 Also, a more extended VTZP basis
set from Ahlrichs et al.,52 also employed
in the work of Román-Román et al.,26 has been adopted here for running B3LYP simulations. The
HF-3c method is implemented and parameterized only for the MINIX18 basis set, which is a STO-3G-like quality basis
set for O, whereas polarization functions are added for the Si atom.
The PBEh-3c method has the def2-mSVP basis set, which is a 535-1111G(d)
and DZP set for Si and O, respectively.

To compute the quasi-experimental
energy of formation, ΔEq-exp, we applied the formula  in which ΔE(ZPE) and
ΔE(298) are the zero point energy and the thermal
corrections, respectively, to the experimental enthalpy of formation
ΔHexp(298). The graphical visualization
and structural manipulation of structures was performed with MOLDRAW
version 2.0.53 Images were rendered with
VDM.54 Analysis of the elastic tensor was
carried out with the ELATE online tool.55
