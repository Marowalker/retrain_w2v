The kinetics of condensation reaction
of methoxyacetone with 2-methyl-6-ethyl
aniline catalyzed by NKC-9 cation exchange resin was studied for the
first time. The reaction temperature of Schiff base synthesis was
determined in the range of 367.15 to 401.15 K by the batch experiments,
and influences of reactant molar ratio, temperature, catalyst dosage,
and particle size on the ultimate conversion were also studied. The
dynamic data were used to be relevant with PH, ER(1), ER(2), and Langmuir
Hinshelwood Hougen Watson homogeneity models. Model parameters, including
reaction equilibrium constants, activation energy, enthalpy change,
entropy change, and rate constants, were solved. The accuracy of the
model was validated by means of both experimental proofs and standard
deviation between the predicted and experimental data. Finally, a
series of characterization tests such as Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and polarizing microscopy were performed
to investigate the structure and properties of NKC-9.

1 Introduction
Schiff
bases,1 also known as imines,
are compounds containing C=N– groups formed by nucleophilic
addition of carbonyl compounds and amino compounds. It is characterized
by the simple synthesis method that lots of Schiff bases with variable
structure and different properties can be derived from changing the
substrate amine and ketone. Nowadays Schiff base compounds and their
metal complexes have important applications in various fields, such
as pharmacy,2 catalysis,3 analytical chemistry,4 corrosion,5 and photochromism.6 They also have antibacterial, bactericidal, antitumor, antiviral,
and other biological activities extensively applied in the medical
field. In addition, the cobalt and nickel complexes of Schiff bases
have been widely used as catalysts in the field of catalysis. Moreover,
the Schiff base, as a good ligand in analytical chemistry, can be
used for the identification and quantitative analysis of metal ions.
In the field of corrosion, certain aromatic Schiff bases are often
adopted as corrosion inhibitors of copper. In the field of photochromism,
some Schiff bases containing characteristic groups also have unique
applications.

N-(2-Methyl-6-ethyl phenyl)-1-methoxypropyl-2-imine
(MEMI), as a kind of important Schiff bases, synthesized by heterogeneous
catalysis was discussed for the first time as shown in Scheme 1. As an important pharmaceutical
intermediate for the synthesis of metolachlor, industrial production
can only be made by asymmetric hydrogenation of this Schiff base,
so the prospects of MEMI for research and its practical value are
very considerable. Generally, the metolachlor has two different configuration
images, including the S configuration and the R configuration. Among them, the metolachlor in the S configuration has herbicidal activity, but the metolachlor
in the R configuration has no herbicidal activity.
In the same case, the herbicidal activity of the s-metolachlor is 1.4–1.6 times that of metolachlor. As a common
herbicide, s-metolachlor7,8 is
commonly used in cash crops such as dry fields, orchards, and vegetable
crops. Besides, it is specially suitable for weeding in paddy fields
with many weeds, early germination, long growing season, and large
weed growth area. On the other hand, half of the R configuration of
the metolachlor has no pharmacological effect; however, it is also
released to the environment. As a result, it not only causes pollution
to the environment, but also increases the input of raw materials.

Scheme 1 Condensation Reaction of Methoxyacetone with 2-Methyl-6-ethyl Aniline
To Produce N-(2-Methyl-6-ethyl phenyl)-1-methoxypropyl-2-imide
In general, the commonly catalysts
used for synthesis of the Schiff
bases are strong proton acid liquid, such as HCl, H2SO4, HF, H3PO4, and so forth. However,
these catalysts can cause environmental pollution and equipment corrosion
problems, increasing the purification difficulty and complexity of
the desired product.9 Therefore, a variety
of environmentally protective and efficient heterogeneous solid acid
catalysts, such as acidic ion exchange resin (Amberlyst-47, Amberlyst-15,
Indion-130 Dowex 50Wx2, Dowex 50Wx8 etc.),10−12 which are used
in acid catalytic reactions, have been developed from the perspective
of eco-friendly economic benefits, including esterification, condensation,
and etherification reaction. Qian13 used
cationic exchange resin to catalyze ketonization of cyclohexanone
with 1,4-butanediol. JagadeeshBabu14 used
ion-exchange resin to synthesize methyl acetate and studied its kinetics.
Sharma15 used Amberlyst-15 to catalyze
the esterification of nonanoic acid with 1-propanol and so forth.16−18

In our study, the NKC-9 cation-exchange resin as a heterogeneous
catalyst was applied to realize the synthesis of Schiff base. At the
same time, effects of the stirring rate, catalyst particle size, initial
molar ratio of reactants, temperature, and catalyst loading factors
on the performance of the catalyst were discussed in this paper through
a series of experiments. The experimental data were processed by several
kinetic models,19,20 and the kinetic parameter rate
equation based on the Langmuir Hinshelwood Hougen Watson (LHHW) reaction
mechanism was also established. The calculated reaction rate and the
experimental measurement results were used to determine the kinetic
model parameters by minimizing the residual sum of squares. The kinetics
and thermodynamics of the catalytic preparation of the MEMI Schiff
base which were studied and discussed in this paper would provide
technical and data support for the subsequent industrial continuous
production.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Selection
of Ion Exchange Resin Catalysts
In order to study the catalytic
activity of strong acid cation-exchange
resins D113, NKC-9, and 001*7, a preliminary comparison was made among
these different resins. As shown in Figure 1, MEA conversion in the presence of NKC-9
is highest when the reaction equilibrium is reached, which means a
better catalytic effect than that of the other two resins. In addition,
the equilibrium time of reaction catalyzed by NKC-9 resin is also
relatively short. Therefore, NKC-9 was selected for further study
of catalytic condensation reaction.

Figure 1 Catalytic activity evaluation of NKC-9,
001*7, and D113 (temperature,
393.15 K; catalyst loading, 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture; MEA/MOA
= 1:1.7; catalyst size, >45 mesh; stirring speed, 450 rpm).

2.2 Kinetic
Experiment and Optimization
2.2.1 Effect of Catalyst Loading
The
influence of the catalyst loading on the conversion was discussed
under the same experimental conditions: the reaction temperature was
393.15 K, and the molar ratio of the reactants was 1:1.7. The catalyst
loading ranges from 0.020 g catalyst/g liquid mixture to 0.030 g catalyst/g
liquid mixture. As shown in Figure 2, the reaction equilibrium time is significantly shortened
with the presence of a catalyst compared with the blank experiment.
When the catalyst loading increases from 0.020 g catalyst/g liquid
mixture to 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture, the MEA conversion measured
at the same reaction time is significantly improved, which is due
to the change of catalyst loading leading to the increase of available
active sites. However, when the catalyst loading increases from 0.025
g catalyst/g liquid mixture to 0.030 g catalyst/g liquid mixture,
the MEA conversion measured under the same reaction time is nearly
the same. The findings indicated that the optimal catalyst loading
is 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture.

Figure 2 Effect of the catalyst loading on the
conversion of MEA (temperature,
393.15 K; catalyst size, >45 mesh; MEA/MOA, 1:1.7; stirring speed,
450 rpm).

2.2.2 Effect
of Reaction Temperature
The effect of different reaction
temperatures on MEA conversion was
investigated under the condition of 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture
and molar ratio of reactants 1:1.7. As shown in the Figure 3, MEA conversion increases
with the increase of temperature before it reaches equilibrium, which
indicates that high temperature facilitates the forward reaction.
At the same time, it can be found that the higher the temperature,
the faster the reaction reaches equilibrium, which suggests the forward
reaction endothermic and more activation sites of ion-exchange resin
emerging with a higher temperature. However, ion-exchange resin maybe
easy to expand and fracture if the reaction temperature is too high.
In conclusion, the optimal reaction temperature of this reaction is
393.15 K.

Figure 3 Effect of reaction temperature (catalyst loading, 0.025 g catalyst/g
liquid mixture; MEA/MOA = 1:1.7; catalyst size, >45 mesh; stirring
speed, 450 rpm).

2.2.3 Effect
of the Molar Ratio of Reactants
In order to determine the
optimal reactants molar ratio, repeated
tests were carried out under the same experimental conditions to investigate
the effects of the molar ratio of reactants (1:1.5, 1:1.7, and 1:1.9)
on the conversion of MEA. Now that MEA has a higher boiling point
and takes a smaller proportion in the gas phase, the yield of the
Schiff base can be precisely calculated based on MEA conversion. According
to the principle of chemical equilibrium, the increasing amount of
MOA can improve MEA conversion. As shown in the Figure 4, when the molar ratio of reactants is increased
from 1:1.5 to 1:1.7, the chemical reaction equilibrium is significantly
increased, which is partly due to the fact that reactants will promote
the forward reaction. However, when the molar ratio goes from 1:1.7
to 1:1.9, the increase of the MEA conversion is not obvious. It is
found that when the reaction is close to equilibrium, the higher the
molar ratio of reactants is, the more difficult the separation of
Schiff base will be, which hinders the forward progress of the reaction.

Figure 4 Effect
of MEA/MOA initial ratio (temperature, 393.15 K; catalyst
size, >45 mesh; catalyst loading, 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture;
stirring speed, 450 rpm).

2.3 Elimination of Internal and External Diffusion
2.3.1 Elimination of External Diffusion
In the process of
studying dynamics, it is necessary to eliminate
influences of internal and external diffusion. In order to eliminate
the external diffusion influence, it is reasonable to determine the
appropriate stirring speed under the optimal conditions of reaction
temperature, molar ratio, and catalyst loading. Therefore, several
tests were carried out under the same experimental condition by changing
the rotating speed, including 350, 450, 500, and 550 rpm. The experimental
results are shown in Figure 5. When the stirring speed increases from 350 to 450 rpm, the
MEA conversion is significantly increased in the same reaction time.
However, when the stirring speed increases from 450 to 550 rpm, the
MEA conversion rate increases slowly. As a result, taking the wear
and tear of the experimental equipment caused by rotating into consideration,
450 rpm was selected as the best condition.

Figure 5 Effect of the stirring
speeds on the conversion of MEA (temperature,
393.15 K; catalyst loading, 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture; MEA/MOA
= 1:1.7; catalyst size, >45 mesh).

2.3.2 Internal Diffusion Elimination
In order to eliminate the internal diffusion influence, the effect
of the catalyst particle size on the conversion of MEA was investigated
by repeated experiments with only change of particle size under the
optimal reaction temperature, molar ratio of materials, catalyst loading,
and appropriate stirring speed. Mesh 24, 30, 38, and 45 of the catalyst
were selected as the experimental objects. As shown in Figure 6, when the particle mesh increases
from 24 to 38, the MEA conversion is significantly increased at the
same time. However, when the particle mesh is greater than 38 mesh,
the MEA conversion does not change obviously with the decrease of
the catalyst particle size. It indicated that more active sites exposed
will facilitate the reaction as the size of catalyst decreases.

Figure 6 Effect of the
catalyst size on the conversion of MEA (temperature,
393.15 K; catalyst loading, 0.025 g catalyst/g liquid mixture; MEA/MOA
= 1:1.7; stirring speed, 450 rpm).

2.4 Structural Characteristics of Fresh and Regenerated
NKC-9 Resin
2.4.1 FT-IR
The Fourier-transform
infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of a new regenerated NKC-9 cation-exchange resin catalyst
are shown in Figure 7. The wide band in the range of 3200–3400 cm–1 is caused by the stretching of −OH in acid cation-exchange
resin. The hydroxyl group comes from the −SO3H of
the resin and water absorbed. The bands observed at approximately
1300–1510 cm–1 are attributed to C=C
stretching (aromatic) vibrations. Because of the asymmetric stretching
vibration of the −CH2 group, absorption peaks of
two high frequency bands appear in 2940–2850 cm–1. The peak at 2350 cm–1 belongs to the carbon dioxide
absorption peak. The wide band of 1670–1620 cm–1 is caused by the carbon bond expansion of vinyl. Several characteristic
absorption peaks are observed at 500–1250 cm–1, which verify the existence of −SO3H. In addition,
in the FT-IR spectrum of the regenerated catalyst, the main peaks
attributed to the fresh catalyst still exist. Therefore, it is found
that the FT-IR spectra of two kinds of strong acid styrene cation-exchange
resin catalysts are basically the same.

Figure 7 Fourier infrared spectra
of NKC-9 cation-exchange resin.

2.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscope
The
surface structure of NKC-9 resin was characterized by a scanning electron
microscope. As shown in the Figure 8, a large number of pores are distributed on the surface
of the resin. Because of the existence of these pores, the reactant
and catalyst can be condensed by means of adsorption, desorption,
and other ways, and the contact area between reactants and the catalyst
is also considerably increased, which is more conducive to the transformation
of the reaction.

2.4.3 Optical
Microscope
The optical
microscope images of the fresh and used NKC-9 resin in a batch stirred
reactor indicating the change of catalyst morphology are shown in
the Figure 9. Figure 9A shows the surface
morphology of the fresh catalyst. It can be observed that the new
catalyst is an irregular ball with a smooth and uniform surface. Figure 9B,C presents the
surface morphology of the catalyst used in the reaction with a magnification
of 35. From the Figure 9B,C, it is found that catalyst ball breaks into hemispheres and the
cracks also appear on the catalyst surface. That is because in the
reaction process, rapid stirring may lead to catalyst rupture or adsorption
and deposition and collision in the catalytic process, which will
also lead to catalyst rupture. The damage rate of ion-exchange resin
calculated is about 3%.

cation-exchange
resin in a batch agitated reactor. [(A) is before the use of catalyst,
(B) is during the use, and (C) is the optical microscope image after
use.]

2.4.4 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
The pore conditions of the NKC-9 resin were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) test. Figure 10 shows the adsorption and desorption curves of NKC-9. It can be seen
from the pore size distribution curve in Figure 11 that the pore size of the catalyst ranges
from 20 to 100 nm. The specific surface area, pore volume, and average
pore diameter of the catalyst calculated by the BET and BJH models
are 27.387 m2/g, 0.205 cm3/g, and 29.928 nm,
respectively.

2.4.5 X-ray
Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the fresh and new regenerated NKC-9 catalyst were
obtained using a power X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Dmax-C) with Cu
Kα radiation (k = 1.5405 Å). The XRD patterns
were scanned from 2θ = 10° to 90°. As is clearly shown
in Figure 12, three
broad peaks are found at the 2θ range of 18.4°, 28.3°,
and 43.3° for the fresh NKC-9 catalyst. The other weak peaks
can be attributed to monoclinic zirconia. From the Figure 12, it is also found that the
three main peaks at 18.4°, 28.3°, and 43.3° still present
in the XRD pattern of the regenerated NKC-9. In addition, the XRD
pattern of the regenerated NKC-9 catalyst is almost identical with
that of the fresh NKC-9 catalyst, indicating the excellent regeneration
performance of the NKC-9 catalyst.

NKC-9 catalyst.

2.5 Kinetics
Model
Considering the non-ideal
behavior of the reaction system in liquid phase, the activity (ai) of the components was used to replace the
mole fraction (xi) in the equilibrium
state. Thus, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant Ke was obtained by the UNIFAC group contribution method.21−23 1  

As shown in Table S1, the equilibrium constant Ke of the reaction
increases with the increase of reaction temperature, indicating that
the reaction is endothermic. ln Ke was also used
to plot 1/T to get the relation between reaction
equilibrium and temperature. Therefore, the thermodynamics of the
reaction is calculated by the van’t Hoff equation. As shown
in Figure 13, the
relation between the equilibrium constant and the temperature can
be obtained as follows 2   3   4  

Figure 13 Relation between reaction equilibrium
constant and temperature.

ln Ke is plotted with 1/T in
pairs as shown in Figure 14. The reaction equilibrium constant Ke within
the temperature range of 366.15–401.15 K can be obtained by
linear-fitting the ln Ke–1/T curve as expressed in eq 5 5  

Figure 14 Relationship between forward reaction rate constant and temperature.

The enthalpy change of reaction
can be obtained by the Hoffmann
equation. As shown in Table 1, this reaction is endothermic at 298.15 K because of ΔH° = 23.474 kJ·mol–1. As a result
of ΔG° = −3.176 kJ·mol–1, the reaction can occur spontaneously at room temperature.

Table 1 Enthalpy Change and Entropy Change

298.15	23.474 kJ·mol–1	89.417 J·mol–1·K–1	–3.176 kJ·mol–1	
In the reaction process, reactants need to diffuse
into the internal
gap of catalyst particles, so the specific kinetic mechanism is required
to describe the process of adsorption, surface reaction, and desorption
in the rediffusion. Considering the different adsorption mechanisms
of various kinetic models, it is proposed to adopt the following four
kinetic models: pseudo-homogeneous (PH) model, Eley–Rideal
(ER) model of adsorption reactant A or B, and LHHW model to verify
the experimental kinetic data.

(1) PH model 6  

(2) ER (1) (Eley–Rideal) model 7  

(3) ER (2) (Eley–Rideal) model 8

From the
normalized equation 15   16  where σ is the
active site, and K1, K2, K3, K4, and K5 are adsorption equilibrium
constants of each component.

Through simultaneous eqs 9–16, the following equation can
be obtained 17  

The exchange capacity qt for each component with the
resin at any time t can be represented with the following
equation 18  where C0 and Ct are the concentration of
each component in aqueous solutions at time 0 and t, respectively, and v is the volume of aqueous solution
for each component. Ki is the adsorption
equilibrium constant obtained from the Langmuir isothermal adsorption
equation 19  where qm is the
maximum adsorption capacity of the resin, and Ki represents the adsorption equilibrium constant. When the
ion exchange reaches the dynamic equilibrium, qt = qe, Ct = Ce.

The reaction rate constant k+ and adsorption
equilibrium constants of each component Ki from 369.15 to 401.15 K are presented in Table S2. The relationship between the forward reaction rate constant
and temperature is shown in Figure 14 in terms of ln k+–1/T. From the Figure 14, the reaction rate constant increases with the increase of
temperature. Thus, the kinetic rate equation and data parameters of
the condensation reaction can be obtained, which provides data support
for the substitution of kinetic model data in the future. According
to the Arrhenius equation 20   21  where k+ is the
forward reaction rate constant, Ea is
the activation energy, and A is the pre-exponential
factor. Therefore, the relationship between the reaction rate constant k+ and temperature can be obtained by linear
regression from Figure 14 as follows 22  

Finally, the data of k+, K1, K2, K4, K5, and Ke are
substituted into the expression 17 to obtain
the condensation reaction rate expression. 23  

In the batch reaction process, the reaction rate of component i can be written according to the mass conservation as follows 24  

The calculated reaction rate is expressed as rcal, and the experimental measured rate is expressed as rexp. The parameters of different kinetic models
can be determined with the value of minimizing the sum squares of
residues (SRSmin) according to the calculated reaction
rate (rcal) and experimental measured
rate (rexp). 25  

The parity plot between
calculated and experimental obtained reaction
rates of LHHW model are shown in Figure 15. The regression data of the theoretical
reaction rate of different kinetic models and the experimental measured
reaction rate at different temperatures obtained using MATLAB software
are presented in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the SRSmin for LHHW model is the smallest in comparison
with other models, so the LHHW model can be used to best represent
the kinetic behavior of catalytic condensation reaction. According
to Figure 15 and Table 2, which shows the
comparison between the figure and SRS, LHHW < ER(2) < ER(1)
< PH, so the LHHW model can better represent the kinetic behavior
of catalytic condensation reaction.

Figure 15 Parity plot between calculated and experimental
obtained reaction
rates of LHHW model.

ER(2) and LHHW Model Data

Ea (kJ·mol–1)	8.756	11.937	12.324	15.841	
Thus, the kinetic rate equation and the parameters
of the condensation
reaction of methoxyacetone with 2-methyl-6-ethyl aniline using NKC-9
as the catalyst are presented in Table S3. At the same time, we can get a plot of ln k+, ln K1, ln K2, ln K4, and ln K5 versus 1/T for condensation reaction
shown in Figure S1.

2.6 Recycling
Performance of the Regenerated NKC-9
Catalyst
The recycle times of the regenerated NKC-9 catalyst
and its impact on the conversion of MEA is another important factor
to characterize the performance of the cation-exchange resin, which
is indicated in Figure S2. According to
the abovementioned characterization results, the NKC-9 resin still
keeps high catalytic activity in the recycling process. However, as
can be seen from Figure 9, in the reaction process, rapid stirring may lead to catalyst rupture
or adsorption, deposition, and collision in the catalytic process,
which will also lead to the reduction of catalytic activity. Therefore,
when the catalyst was used for five times, the catalytic activity
appeared to decline slowly.

3 Conclusions
In this study, MEMI was synthesized for the first time in a batch
reactor using different ion-exchange resins: D113, NKC-9, and 001*7.
In the meanwhile, the synthesis kinetics was studied to provide data
support for future industrial continuous production. It was found
that the NKC-9 cation-exchange resin had the most outstanding catalytic
property among those investigated resins, and therefore it was chosen
for further study. Thereafter, the optimal operating conditions of
the catalytic reaction was determined at temperature of 393.15 K,
catalyst loading of 0.025 g/g liquid mixture, and reactant molar ratio
of 1:1.7. In addition, the influence of external diffusion of the
reaction system was eliminated with the stirring speed of 450 rpm,
while the influence of the internal diffusion could be wiped off with
the catalyst particle size superior to 45 mesh. The thermodynamic
equilibrium constant Ke was obtained by the UNIFAC
group contribution method at temperature range of 367.15 to 401.15
K. The reaction enthalpy change at 298.15 K is 23.47 kJ·mol–1, indicating that the reaction is endothermic, whereas
the Gibbs free energy change calculated by Hoffman equations is 3.176
kJ·mol–1, suggesting that the reaction is spontaneous
at room temperature.

Through the calculated reaction rate value
and the regression of
experimental dynamic data, it is shown that the LHHW model can best
represent the kinetic process of Schiff base synthesis reaction. In
addition, the study of thermodynamics and kinetics data will provide
the optimal experimental and theoretical basis for the synthetic process
of the Schiff base. The high value of the apparent activation energy
of the MEMI Schiff base synthesis also supports the assumption that
the reaction in the catalyst surface may be the rate-controlling step.

2-Methyl-6-ethyl
aniline
(chemical pure, Agricultural Development in Henan Agrochemical Co.
Ltd.), methoxy acetone (chemical pure, Shandong Qiao Chang Chemical
Co. Ltd.), toluene (analytical pure, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.
Ltd.), and D113, NKC-9, 001*7 Ion-exchange resins (Nankai University,
China) were produced by chemical plants in China. The resin was pretreated
before use. It was soaked in saturated NaCl solution for 8 h to remove
impurities, then soaked in 5% dilute hydrochloric acid for 4 h to
stimulate acidic sites, and finally washed with deionized water. The
physical and chemical properties of cation-exchange resin are shown
in Table S4.

4.2 Preparation
of the Schiff Base
The
synthesis of the Schiff base was carried out in a three-neck flask
containing a water separator, a reflux condenser, a sampling device,
and a thermometer. First, the reactant methoxyacetone and 2-methyl-6-ethyl
aniline were weighed and added to the volumetric flask, followed by
toluene with water agent, and then the corresponding molecular weight
of the ion-exchange resin was determined and it was added to the flask.
The experiments at different conditions were carried out by adjusting
the vacuum degree and changing the temperature of the reaction system.
In the reaction process, syringe timing sampling was used for real-time
detection by an Agilent gas chromatograph (7890B, Shanghai Lairui
Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.)

4.3 Analytical Methods and Characterizations
The yield
of the target product was determined by GC (Agilent 7890B,
Shanghai Lairui Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.), and the specific
conditions were shown as follows: chromatographic column: se-3 quartz
capillary column, the column length was 50 m. The pre-column pressure
of hydrogen and nitrogen carrier gas was 0.1 MPa, and that of air
was 0.03 MPa. Injection volume: 0.1 μm; Sample temperature:
523.15 K; FID detection temperature: 553.15 K; keep application temperature:
353.15 K/5 min, after rising at a rate of 283.15 K/min to 523.15 K,
keep 2 min. At the same time, benzyl alcohol was used as the internal
standard to calibrate the actual content of each component. MEA conversion
is defined as the ratio of the MEA conversion amount to MEA total
amount.

It was found by gas chromatograph and NMR that no impurity
peaks appeared except the peaks of products, raw materials and solvents.
Therefore, this esterification reaction catalyzed by ion-exchange
resins is thought to be without byproducts, approximately.

The
calculation method of conversion (Xi) and yield (Yi) is shown as formulas 26 and 27, where ni is
the molar number of component i and ni,t is the
molar number of component i after t time. 26   27
