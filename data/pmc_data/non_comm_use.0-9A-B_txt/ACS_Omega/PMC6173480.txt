Interfacial nanobubbles
can exist on various hydrophobic and hydrophilic
material interfaces. There are diverse applications for oxygen nanobubbles,
which are closely related to their content and long-term stability.
However, it remains challenging to determine the amount of nanobubbles
loaded in a porous material. In this study, a novel method was used
to quantify the total amount of oxygen nanobubbles loaded onto irregular
particulate materials. Different materials were evaluated and their
oxygen-loading capacities were found to be as follows: activated carbon
(AC) > zeolite > biochar > diatomite > coal ash > clay.
Significant
differences in oxygen-loading capacities were mainly ascribed to differences
in the specific surface area and hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties
of the materials. The total oxygen loading on AC achieved using the
high pressure loading method was higher than that achieved by the
temperature variation method. This new quantitative method provides
the possibility for the manipulation of oxygen nanobubble materials
in practical applications and it is anticipated to be an important
supplement to the existing methods of characterizing interfacial oxygen
nanobubbles. Our results demonstrate that materials containing oxygen
nanobubbles can significantly increase the dissolved oxygen and oxidation
reduction potential in anaerobic systems. With the addition of oxygen-loaded
materials (such as AC), the survival time of zebrafish was prolonged
up to 20 h in a deoxygenated water system, and the germination rate
of Vallisneria spiralis was also increased
from 27 to 73% in an anaerobic sediment.

1 Introduction
Nanobubbles
are gas-filled bubbles that spontaneously form at the
interface of solid surfaces and aqueous solutions.1 The first experimental evidence of the existence of nanobubbles
on various hydrophobic surfaces was provided in 2000 using tapping-mode
atomic force spectroscopy (AFM).2,3 During the last decade,
nanobubbles have already been widely used in the fields of medicine,4 physiology,5 and water
treatment.6

Various methods have
been established for the preparation of nanobubbles,
such as solvent-exchange,7,8 temperature gradient,9 microwave,10 pressure
reduction, and electrochemical methods.11−14 Three types of nanoscale gas
domains, known as surface nanobubbles,15−17 nanopancakes,18−20 and bulk nanobubbles,21,22 have been characterized
by various techniques, such as AFM, spectroscopic methods, rapid cryofixation/freeze
fracture, quartz crystal microbalance, neutron reflectometry, and
X-ray reflectivity. These techniques can efficiently provide bubble
images and relevant information, but they are still limited to relatively
flat substrates, such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite,23−25 mica,26 gold,27 polystyrene,28,29 and silicon surfaces hydrophobized
by silanization.30 Nanobubbles can also
form and exist on porous materials with irregular surface structures,
but the previously mentioned techniques are not suitable for nanobubble
analysis. In our previous study, we demonstrated that synchrotron-based
scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy can be used to detect
oxygen nanobubbles formed on the diatomite particle–water interface
under ambient conditions.31 However, this
method is heavily dependent on the advanced synchrotron facility.
More importantly, it is challenging to obtain the absolute loading
or the total amount of nanobubbles formed on the porous solid material
surfaces in the suspension because of the unknown density and inner
pressure of the nanoscale gas state.32,33 Thus, to comprehensively
evaluate the nanobubbles at irregular surface interfaces, a quick
and easy method of quantifying nanobubbles is urgently needed.

Oxygen-filled nanobubbles (oxygen nanobubbles) have potential applications
in various research fields including nanofluidics,34 nanochemistry,35,36 nanomechanics,37 nanomedicine,38,39 and environmental
treatment because of their ability to produce free radicals. Oxygen
nanobubbles have also been employed for detoxification of water and
degradation of organic compounds in wastewater treatment.40−42 Moreover, oxygen nanobubbles loaded on porous solid particles of
natural clay can be purposely delivered to eutrophic shallow lakes
or anoxic sediment and efficiently revive polluted lakes.43−48 Determining the highest possible loading of surface oxygen nanobubbles
in modified macroscopic particles is essential for the application
of nanobubbles in remediation of an anoxic sediment and eutrophication
in aquatic environments.

The aim of this study is to develop
a quick and easy absorption
method to measure the total amount of oxygen nanobubbles loaded in
a solid suspension. Various particles, including activated carbon
(AC), biochar, diatomite, zeolite, coal ash, and clay, were selected
as the oxygen nanobubble carrier using the temperature gradient and
high-pressure loading methods. The oxygen nanobubble loading capacities
and rates were quantified and compared by the proposed method. Moreover,
the potential anaerobic sediment-remediating abilities of the aforementioned
materials were also evaluated in lab-scale column experiments. The
present study will provide a great choice of loading materials and
manipulation methods for the use of oxygen nanobubbles in the field
of environmental remediation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Oxygen Nanobubble Loading in the AC Suspension
In this
study, nanobubbles were prepared by a simple and efficient
procedure, that is, the temperature variation method.49,50 When the temperature in the oxygen solution (25 mg/L) was increased
from 5 to 60 °C, the generated oxygen nanobubbles were analyzed
using NanoSight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) technology. As
presented in Figure 1, nanobubbles were formed with a mean diameter of 182 nm, and the
total number density of nanobubbles in the water system was 3.10 ×
108 particles/mL. Meanwhile, nanobubbles were also formed
in the suspension system with AC (5 g/L) under the same initial oxygen
concentration (25 mg/L) and temperature gradient. From the results
in Figure 2, the total
number density of bulk nanobubbles in the liquid was decreased dramatically
to 1.85 × 108 particles/mL, and this reduction may
be due to the nanobubbles generated on the surfaces of the porous
structures of the AC. However, the current known methods are unable
to measure the total loading amount of oxygen nanobubbles in particle
suspensions, which can be essential for practical applications and
manipulation of nanobubbles.

2.2 Quantification
of Oxygen Nanobubble Loading
in the Solid Suspension
In this study, an experimental apparatus
was designed to measure the total amount of oxygen nanobubbles in
the solid suspensions. Therefore, the total oxygen in the AC system
was measured, which revealed that AC could be loaded with 2.85 mg
O2/g AC by the temperature gradient method. The principles
of the current method are as follows: (1) by increasing the temperature
and using mechanical stirring, the release of oxygen from the porous
materials could be accelerated; (2) N2 gas was used as
the circulation gas between two connected sealed flasks and this could
also help to transfer oxygen released from the solid suspension in
flask A to absorption flask B with Na2SO3 as
the oxygen reductant. Online dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements were
used to determine the oxygen level in the two flasks, and the reaction
was allowed to continue until the oxygen concentration reached zero
in both flasks. It can be assumed that the oxygen was totally consumed
by Na2SO3. Thus, the total oxygen in the suspensions
can be obtained by calculating the amount of Na2SO3 consumed in the whole reaction process.

To improve
the amount of oxygen loading in the porous materials, the high-pressure
method was used in this work. Different materials were tested in this
work, including AC, zeolite, biochar, diatomite, coal ash, and clay.
From the results in Figure 3, an oxygen loading of 31.75 mg O2/g was achieved
for AC, which was higher than that obtained with other materials.
Also, the high-pressure method dramatically improved the oxygen loading
as compared with the temperature variation method (2.85 mg/g). The
oxygen-loading capacities of zeolite, biochar, diatomite, coal ash,
and clay were found to be 21.17, 20.11, 13.23, 5.09, and 4.87 mg/g,
respectively. These differences were mainly attributed to differences
in the specific surface area and surface wettability. As shown in Figure 3, the oxygen-loading
capacity of a material is correlated to its specific surface area.
The formation of surface nanobubbles was strongly dependent on the
nature of the substrates. Hydrophobic substrates experience long-range
attraction between hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water, which is
a much more suitable condition for nanobubble formation than is found
with hydrophilic substrates.51,52 AC is a hydrophobic
porous material with a large specific surface area [Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), 700 m2/g], which presents the perfect conditions
for nanobubble loading.

area.

2.3 Potential
Applications of Oxygen Nanobubble
Loading Materials
The oxygen-releasing abilities of these
samples were determined by testing the survival time of zebra fish
in the deoxygenated ultrapure water system with 7 wt % oxygen-modified
materials. The control system contained only deoxygenated water. The
zebra fish died after 1 h in the control system, while the survival
times of the fish increased with the addition of oxygen-modified materials.
As shown in Figure 4, zebra fish were still alive in the zeolite and AC systems after
20 h, which agrees with the experimental results showing that zeolite
and AC have higher oxygen-loading capacities. Experiments were also
carried out in the presence of materials without loading oxygen. The
zebra fish has longer survival times than that in the control system,
while its effect is much less than oxygen-modified materials, and
all the zebra fish died in 3 h (Figure S1).

Figure 4 Effects of oxygen-modified materials on the survival time of zebra
fish in the deoxygenated water. (a,b) Figures of the test.

Materials containing oxygen nanobubbles may have
potential applications
in environmental remediation under anaerobic/anoxic conditions. In
order to evaluate the anaerobic/anoxic remediation potential, another
group of experiments were carried out in columns containing an anaerobic
lake sediment and water. Oxygen-modified materials were added to the
system, and a 1 cm capping layer was placed on the sediment–water
interface. The system without any capping layer was set as the control
column. As shown in Figure 5a, the DO in the column was significantly increased with the
addition of the oxygen-modified materials. Hence, the DO could last
longer in all the treated systems than in the control system after
120 days of experiments. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of
the sediment was significantly improved in the system with oxygen-modified
materials and a capping layer (Figure 5b). This improvement will be helpful for remediation
in anaerobic sediment environments, which can have long-term effects
on microorganisms and the transformation of pollutants.53−57

Figure 5 Effects
of various oxygen-modified capping layers on the (a) DO
and (b) ORP.

In this work, the effect
of oxygen-modified materials on the anaerobic
remediation of a hydrophyte was also tested. Vallisneria
spiralis seeds were used as the test model hydrophyte.
In systems with oxygen-loaded zeolite, AC, and coal ash, the seed
germination rates of Vallisneria spiralis were 73, 67, and 67%, respectively (Figure 6), whereas the seed germination rate was
only 27% in the control column. This implies that the presence of
oxygen-modified diatomite and clay also improved the germination rates
compared with the control system. However, the performance of these
materials in terms of improving the germination rate was less than
the other three materials because of their lower oxygen-loading capacity.
This work has confirmed that nanobubbles could establish an important
oxidative window for hydrophyte germination in an anaerobic sediment.58 These results corroborate previous findings
where nanobubbles were effectively used to accelerate the metabolism
of living organisms and seed germination by introducing reactive oxygen
species.59−61 Current findings are also in accordance with reported
studies wherein Brassica campestris and cucumber plants showed a significant increase in leaf weight
and surface area in the presence of air-nanobubble solutions with
higher DO concentrations compared to that of normal water.5,62

rate of Vallisneria spiralis. Oxygen-loaded
materials include O-zeolite, O-AC, O-coal ash, O-diatomite, and O-clay.

3 Conclusions
We have presented a simple and cost-effective method for determining
the total oxygen nanobubble loading in porous materials, which can
be an important supplement to the existing methods of characterizing
oxygen nanobubbles. The total oxygen loadings on AC, zeolite, biochar,
diatomite, coal ash, and clay were found to be 31.75, 21.17, 20.11,
13.23, 5.09, and 4.87 mg/g, respectively. This difference is ascribed
to their different properties, particularly the specific surface area
and the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the surface. These results
will be useful for choosing among different possible materials for
practical applications. Applications of these materials were assessed
in anaerobic/anoxic conditions. The oxygen-loaded materials can prolong
the survival time of zebra fish in a deoxygenated water system and
improve the germination rate of Vallisneria spiralis in an anaerobic sediment. Our results have also demonstrated that
a 1 cm capping layer containing oxygen nanobubbles could significantly
improve the DO and ORP in an anaerobic aqueous system. Porous materials
loaded with oxygen nanobubbles may have broad applications in environmental
remediation. Although our results have provided a powerful characterization
tool for oxygen nanobubbles in particulate matter, further research
is needed to optimize the various effective parameters.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
AC (particle size: 4–6
mm) and biochar were obtained from Henan province, China. Zeolite
(particle size: 2–4 mm) was obtained from Hebei province. Coal
ash (Shanxi province, China) and clay (Beijing local soil) were washed
with deionized water, dried at 100 °C for 24 h, and then sieved
through 180 mesh before use (particle size < 90 μm). Na2SO3 and diatomite were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Works (Beijing, China). Pure oxygen (99.99%) was used in this experiment.
All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification.
Water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Boston,
MA).

4.2 Setup of Oxygen Measurement
The oxygen
measurement setup was used as described in Figure 7 and consisted of two connected sealed flasks.
Flask A contained experimental samples, such as solid suspensions,
and flask B contained the oxygen absorption system. Flask A was kept
in a water bath, which was used to manipulate the system temperature,
and both flasks were continuously stirred during the experiments.
N2 gas was used as the circulation gas between flasks A
and B. Oxygen released from the solid materials could be transferred
into flask B. The total amount of oxygen in the suspensions could
be obtained by measuring the amount of Na2SO3, which was used as the oxygen reductant in the reaction process.
The DO meter was connected to a computer to record and measure the
DO concentration in the reaction system in real time.

4.3 Sample Preparation and Characterization
In this work, nanobubbles were prepared by the temperature gradient
method and the high-pressure loading method.

4.3.1 Temperature
Gradient Method
An
oxygen-saturated solution was obtained by purging pure oxygen into
the solution. DO was measured by the DO meter (JPSJ605, Shanghai REX
Instrument Factory). To prepare a sample, 2.5 g of AC was added to
500 mL of the solution, while ultrapure water was used as a control
sample. All samples were placed in an ice bath, and the temperature
was gradually increased from 5 to 60 °C. The amount of free bulk
nanobubbles was determined using NanoSight NTA technology (NS500,
Bruker, Germany), and samples were filtrated by a 0.45 μm membrane
before measurement. The total amount of oxygen nanobubbles on the
particle surface was determined by the absorbing method (Figure 7).

4.3.2 High-Pressure Method
The AC and
zeolite particles were washed by water to remove any dust, and all
the solid materials were dried at 100 °C for 24 h to remove water
from the pores. The BET specific surface areas of the particles were
determined using a surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020 HD88,
Micromeritics). The obtained solid materials were kept in a container
at −0.075 MPa for 2 h to remove air from the materials, and
then the reactor was filled with pure O2, and a pressure
of up to 0.15 MPa was maintained for 0.5 h. This step was repeated
two times, and the pressure was then kept at 0.15 MPa pressure for
12 h before the O2 pressure was slowly reduced to atmospheric
pressure. Subsequently, the materials were removed, delivered into
flask A, and the online measurements were recorded.

4.4 Application of the Materials Containing Oxygen
Nanobubbles
The column tests were conducted in the laboratory
over a total duration of 120 days. The diameter and height of the
column were 10 and 50 cm, respectively. The anaerobic sediments were
obtained from a lake (Taihu, China), and the height of the sediment
was 5 cm at the bottom of the column. Water was added into the system.
After 2 days of stabilization, the prepared materials containing oxygen
nanobubbles were used to cap the sediment, and the height of the capping
layer was 1 cm. The DO in the system and the ORP of the sediment were
determined by the MI-parameter Meter (Hach, USA). Meanwhile Vallisneria spiralis seeds were sowed in each column.
The germination rate of the seeds in the anaerobic sediment was also
tested. A column without a capping layer was used as the control.
The effects of the oxygen-modified materials on the survival time
of zebra fish were observed in a deoxygenated water system with 7
wt % of modified materials. A timer was used to record the survival
time of each fish in each system, and all experiments were repeated
three times to obtain the mean survival time of the fish.
