This study describes the use of polyisobutylene
(PIB) to phase-anchor
pyridine ligands that form a phase-separable Grubbs third-generation
catalyst. We further show that this complex is useful in ring-opening
metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. These PIB-bound pyridine-ligated
Grubbs catalysts provide the same benefits of control over polymer
chain growth and polydispersity of the product as their low-molecular-weight
analogs and reduce Ru leaching in ROMP products from approximately
16% (820 ppm residues) as seen with a similar pyridine-ligated catalyst
to a value of approximately 3% (160 ppm residues). These labile ligands
are shown to be as effective at generating separable metal complexes
as less labile PIB-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst
ligands that are typically used for immobilization but that require
a multistep synthesis.

Introduction
The use of catalysts
is recognized as an important stratagem for
developing greener chemical processes because catalysts by definition
enable more efficient syntheses. However, although the use of catalysts
is ubiquitous, there can be problems with homogeneous catalysts because
the homogeneous catalyst residues sometimes contaminate the reaction
products. Although this problem can be mitigated if the catalyst has
exceptional turnover numbers or can be unimportant if the catalyst
residues do not affect the product or its intended use, there continues
to be an emphasis on developing strategies designed to recover and
reuse homogeneous transition metal catalysts or to separate catalyst
residues from products because catalyst or ligand residues more often
than not are an issue.1−5 For example, this has been accomplished for ring-closing metathesis
(RCM) using immobilization of catalysts on poly(vinyl pyridine),1 using inorganic supports,2 or using insoluble organic polymers.3 Ru contamination of products is also a problem for polymerization
reactions, where catalyst residues formed by vinyl ether quenching
of the Ru catalyst contaminate the polymer product.4−8 Because such residues can affect the function of
a product, they have to be removed. Conventional approaches to separate
catalyst residues from polymer products use solvent precipitation,
where a contaminated product is dissolved in the minimum amount of
a good solvent and then precipitated by adding the concentrated solution
to a large excess of a “poor” solvent for the polymer.
Typically, this precipitation process has to be carried out several
times. Sometimes a chromatographic purification is also required to
generate polymer products with modest catalyst residues. However,
although this approach can produce a small amount of pure polymer,
it generates large amounts of waste. An alternative approach is to
use a phase-anchored catalyst. In this alternative approach, phase-anchored
ligands that are strongly bound to a metal center are prepared, often
in a multistep synthesis. The resulting catalysts are then strongly
bonded throughout a reaction to a ligand that has been immobilized
on an insoluble support. The catalyst can then be separated physically
from a polymerization product because the phase-anchored ligand never
dissociates from the metal. Strategies that use phase-anchored ligands
that dissociate from a metal have also been explored. For example,
in metathesis chemistry, Barrett suggested that Ru catalysts that
dissociate from a polymer-bound benzylidene ligand could be recovered
if the Ru would reattach itself to an immobilized styrene after a
reaction.9 In this concept, the ligand
dissociates from the metal and then reassociates to the metal after
the reaction. We explored this approach in both Ru-catalyzed metathesis
and polymerization reactions using a soluble heptane phase-anchored
styrene.10 Subsequent work showed that
polyisobutylene (PIB)-bound N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that
never dissociate from Ru were more effective in separating Ru residues
after either RCM or ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)
chemistry.11 However, PIB-bound NHC ligands
require a multistep synthesis. They are thus not as readily available
as the commercial Ru metathesis catalysts. Here, we show that Ru polymerization
catalysts that contain weakly bound 4-polyisobutylpyridine or 4-polyisobutyl-3-bromopyridine
ligands are a more efficient alternative to Ru complexes that use
these PIB-bound NHC ligands. We show that these
PIB-bound pyridine Ru complexes are easily formed from commercially
available Ru complexes and that the resulting catalysts have reactivity
and control over polymerization reactions that is indistinguishable
from those of Ru complexes with low-molecular-weight pyridine ligands.9 We also show that these Ru complexes that are
phase anchored by PIB-bound pyridine ligands can be separated from
polymerization products efficiently unlike Ru complexes with low-molecular-weight
pyridine ligands. Overall, these PIB–pyridine-ligated catalysts
are nearly equivalent to complexes with PIB-bound NHC ligands or to
Ru complexes containing PIB-bound pyridine and PIB-bound NHC ligands
in ROMP chemistry in terms of separation efficiency and superior to
separable Ru complexes without pyridine ligands in terms of control
over the polymerization process. Although we had expected that ephemeral
PIB-bound pyridine ligands would not be as effective in separating
Ru catalyst residues as PIB-bound NHC ligands, the expectation did
not prove to be correct suggesting that the need to prepare phase-anchored
strongly bound ligands to effect catalyst/product separations in other
cases might not always be necessary.

Experimental Section
Materials
Alkene-terminated PIB (Glissopal 1000) with
a nominal Mn of 1000 and a polydispersity
index (PDI) of 1.05 is a commercial product and was a gift from BASF.
All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used
without further purification unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) was freshly distilled from CaH2 and sodium/benzophenone
under nitrogen. Toluene and dichloromethane (DCM) were dried with
molecular sieves (3 Å) and degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles. Compounds 7,1213,1314,13 and 21(14) were all prepared according to the literature procedures. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral assignments of the ROMP
polymers 17(15) and 19(16) and catalyst 21(12) were consistent with the literature reports.
Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (δ) relative
to residual proton resonances in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3).

PIB-Terminated Iodide 8
A 50 mL round-bottomed
flask was charged with compound 7 (1.4 g, 1.4 mmol),
PPh3 (0.477 g, 1.82 mmol), imidazole (0.124 g, 1.82 mmol),
iodine (0.459 g, 1.82 mmol), and 14 mL of DCM. This mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 12 h. At this point, the solvent was removed
via reduced pressure, and the mixture was redissolved in 10 mL of
hexane. The mixture was filtered through Celite to yield a colorless
solution. After hexane was removed at reduced pressure, the crude
product was purified using column chromatography (hexane) to yield
product 8 as a colorless liquid (67% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.31–3.26 (dd, J = 9.5, 4.2 Hz, 1H), 3.17–3.13 (dd, J = 10.2, 6.4 Hz, 1H), 1.46–0.75 (m, 180H).

PIB-Bound
Picoline 9 or Br-Picoline 10
A
100 mL flame-dried flask was charged with 4-picoline
(0.387 mL, 3.98 mmol) or 3-bromo-4-picoline (0.453 g, 3.98 mmol) and
5 mL of THF. Then, lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) (2.65 mL, 5.3 mmol)
was added to this solution at −78 °C, and the resulting
reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. At this point, product 8 (3 g, 2.65 mmol) in 5 mL of THF was added dropwise to the
reaction flask. Then, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to
room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 h. At this point,
the reaction mixture was dark purple. Then, 30 mL of saturated aqueous
NH4Cl and 30 mL of H2O were added. The reaction
mixture turned yellow. The resulting mixture was placed in a separatory
funnel, and the polar phase was extracted with hexane (2 × 30
mL) and washed with MeCN (2 × 20 mL), H2O (2 ×
10 mL), and brine (2 × 10 mL). The hexane phase was then dried
with NaSO4, and the solvent was removed at reduced pressure
to yield product 9 (92% yield) or 10 (86%
yield) as yellow liquid.

Grubbs Third-Generation Containing 9 or 10
A 10 mL flame-dried round-bottomed
flask was charged with
product 9 (0.49 g, 0.300 mmol) or 10 (0.50
g, 0.300 mmol), Grubbs second-generation catalyst (0.115 g, 0.136
mmol), CuCl (0.013 g, 0.136 mmol), and dry DCM (4 mL). The mixture
was stirred at 40 °C for 1 h (the color changed from purple to
green in 5 min). The solution was cooled to room temperature and passed
through Celite to yield a green filtrate. The solvent was removed
via reduced pressure to yield product 11 or 12 as green viscous oil. Although 11 or 12 are not stable in air, theycan be stored in a glove box for at least
6 months. Typical yields in the synthesis of catalysts 11 and 12 from 9 or 10 were
96% and 95%, respectively.

General Procedure for the
Conversion Curve of ROMP Reaction
of 15
An NMR tube was charged with solution 15 (0.06 g, 0.3 mmol). Then, 0.003 mmol 11, 12, 13, or 14, and 0.6 mL of CDCl3 were added to the NMR tube. The reaction was then followed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy, observing the disappearance of
the monomer and the appearance of the polymer vinyl protons (6.25
and 5.55δ, respectively).

Catalyst 21
Catalyst 21 was
prepared following a literature procedure and was characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The spectra obtained
corresponded to those reported in the literature.12 Although we were able to characterize 21,
our results in this study suggested that it is not especially stable
and it could not be stored for any appreciable time even in a glove
box.

Catalyst 22
Catalyst 22 was
prepared directly from catalyst 21 in an NMR tube. In
this chemistry, CuCl was used to sequester labile tricyclohexylphosphine
present in catalyst 21. In a typical procedure, a mixture
of 29 mg (0.01 mmol) PIB-supported second-generation Grubbs complex,
37 mg (0.022 mmol) 3-bromo-4-(polyisobutyl)pyridine, and 1 mg (0.01
mmol) CuCl in 1 mL of chloroform-d1 was
heated at 40 °C in a sealed NMR tube for 30 min, at which point
the reaction was complete as indicated by 1H NMR. The resulting
green solution was then filtrated through Celite, and the solution
was used directly for ROMP reactions. 1H NMR (300 MHz,
CDCl3) δ: 19.05 (s, 1H), 8.64 (b, 2H), 8.38 (d, J = 5.1 Hz, 2H), 7.49 (m, 1H), 7.20 (s, 2H), 7.13 (d, J = 5.1 Hz, 2H), 7.11 (s, 2H), 7.01 (br, 4H), 4.06 (m, 4H),
2.67 (b, 6H), 2.25 (b, 6H), 2.01–0.6 (m, 560H). Although we
were able to obtain a 1H NMR spectrum of the presumed complex 21 and observe using 31P NMR spectroscopy that
the presumed complex 21 did not contain phosphine, we
were unable to obtain 13C NMR spectra of 21 that we prepared on this 0.01 mmol scale.

General Procedure
for ROMP Reactions Catalyzed by 12 or 14 or 22
A 10 mL round-bottomed
flask containing a magnetic stirring bar was charged with 0.01 mmol
Ru catalyst. After three cycles of vacuum/N2 degassing,
1 mL of DCM was added to the mixture. Once the catalyst dissolved,
a solution of 1 mmol monomer in an additional 1 mL of DCM was added
to the reaction mixture. The polymerization was allowed to continue
at room temperature for 1 h. Then, 0.05 mL of butyl vinyl ether (BVE)
was added to quench the reaction. After 1 h, the reaction mixture
was concentrated at reduced pressure to a volume of approximately
1 mL. This concentrated solution of polymer product was then added
to 10 mL of hexane (MeOH in the case of 14) to precipitate
the ROMP polymer product. The product was then characterized using
gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
(ICP-MS) analyses for Ru contamination.

Digestion Procedure
for ICP-MS Analyses
The sample
to be analyzed was added to a glass vial along with 2 g of concentrated
nitric acid. The mixture was heated to 120 °C for 24 h. At this
point, 2 g of concentrated sulfuric acid was added, and the system
was heated again to 120 °C for 24 h. The clear solution that
formed was then allowed to cool to room temperature and was diluted
with 1% nitric acid aqueous solution as necessary to produce an ICP-MS
analysis sample. The diluted sample solution was then analyzed using
ICP-MS, which allowed us to determine the ppm of the metal in the
diluted ICP-MS sample, which could be converted by simple math into
micrograms of metal/grams of the analysis sample (ppm).

Instruments
The molecular weight and polydispersity
of the polymer products were determined using a Viscotek GPC equipped
with UV, RI, and RALS detectors. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a 300 MHz spectrometer operating at 299.91 MHz. 13C
NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz spectrometer operating at 75.41
MHz. 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz spectrometer
operating at 121.49 MHz. ICP-MS analyses were performed using a PerkinElmer
NexION 350 ICP-MS spectrometer.

Results and Discussion
Prior
Strategies for the Design of Separable Soluble Polymer-Ligated
Ru Metathesis Catalysts
In our initial studies on phase-anchored
Ru metathesis catalysts, we prepared PIB–benzylidene-bound
Ru complex 1(10) (Figure 1) that was analogous to Ru
complexes supported on cross-linked polystyrene resins that the Barrett
group had shown were effective at reducing Ru contamination in metathesis
chemistry. We mainly used complex 1 in RCM chemistry
of substrates such as diethyl diallylmalonate. In those RCM reactions,
Ru leaching was typically 3% of the starting Ru catalyst. One ROMP
reaction was also carried out with 1 using a maleimide–furan
adduct as a substrate in THF. In these cases, Ru leaching was 4%,
which was comparable to the 3% Ru leaching observed in RCM reactions
with catalyst 1 and measurably higher than the 0.4% Ru
leaching observed for RCM reactions with catalyst 2(11) that had PIB phase anchors attached to an NHC
ligand that is thought to remain attached to Ru throughout the catalyst
cycle.

Figure 1 PIB-supported Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation catalysts 1 and 2.

In subsequent work, we continued to use soluble polyolefin
oligomer-bound
NHC ligands both in RCM and ROMP reactions with Hoveyda–Grubbs
catalysts with tricyclohexylphosphine-ligated generation catalysts
such as 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 2).14,17 Although this required a multistep synthesis of the polyolefin-bound
NHC ligands, this strategy consistently led to Ru-leaching levels
that were much lower than those observed with Ru complexes that did
not contain a polymer-bound NHC group. These results suggested us
that polymer-supported NHC ligands that are thought to remain associated
with the Ru center throughout the catalytic reaction and after quenching
would be the best candidates for designing separable systems that
can produce ROMP products with minimal Ru residues.

Phase Selectively Soluble
PIB–Pyridine-Ligated Ru(II)
Metathesis Catalysts
Although the strategy of attaching soluble
polyolefins to NHC ligands affords soluble polymer-bound Ru complexes
with polymer-bound NHC ligands that are reasonably effective at lowering
Ru residues in RCM and ROMP products, the extra control over ROMP
chemistry that is afforded by third-generation ROMP catalysts containing
4-bromopyridine ligands is an appealing feature. Because we had already
shown that the LDA deprotonation of 4,4′-dimethylbipyridine
followed by alkylation with a −CH2I terminated PIB
oligomer 8 was a suitable route to PIB-bound Ru(bipy)Cl2 complexes,18 we decided to examine
similar chemistry with 4-methylpyridine and 3-bromo-4-methylpyridine.
As shown in Scheme 1, this chemistry works well. Good isolable yields of 4-polyisobutylpyridine
and 3-bromo-4-polyisobutylpyridine were realized. With 4-polyisobutylpyridine 9 and 3-bromo-4-polyisobutylpyridine 10 in hand,
we prepared Ru PIB-supported Grubbs third-generation Ru complexes 11 and 12 by allowing a Grubbs second-generation
catalyst to react with either 9 or 10 in
the presence of CuCl at 40 °C for 1 h (Scheme 1). The resulting Ru complexes 11 and 12 were fully characterized using 1H
and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Both complexes were soluble in
heptane at room temperature and visually phase selectively soluble
in the heptane phase of heptane/polar solvent biphasic mixtures, as
shown in Figure 3.

heptane/dimethylformamide mixture and of the DMF solubility of the
low-molecular-weight counterpart 13 (or 14) in a thermomorphic heptane/DMF mixture.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of PIB-Supported Grubbs Third-Generation Complexes 11 and 12
Reactivity of PIB–Pyridine-Ligated Ru(II) Metathesis
Catalysts
Prior studies comparing the reactivity of low-molecular-weight
catalysts or reagents have included the studies of PEOlig-bound Ni diene oligomerization catalysts,19 PEOlig-bound Rh hydrogenation catalysts,20 PIB-bound salen polycarbonate polymerization catalysts,21 PIB–vinyl ether quenching agents for
Ru carbenes,22 and 13C NMR studies
of phosphine ligand exchange at Ag(I) centers.23 All of these studies have shown little or no change in
reactivity for a terminal polymer-supported ligand or reagent versus
a low-molecular-weight analog. Exceptions only occur when the reaction
studied requires solvents in which the polymer-bound catalyst has
a limited solubility.24 Thus, we expected
pyridine ligands such as 9 and 10 to have
effects in ROMP chemistry like those observed by Grubbs with low-molecular-weight
pyridine ligands. To confirm this, our initial tests examined whether
phase selectively soluble PIB-supported Grubbs third-generation catalysts 11 and 12 have the same activities as their low-molecular-weight
counterparts. This was accomplished by carrying out conversion curves
of an ROMP reaction of the norbornene derivative 15 in
0.6 mL of CDCl3 (1 mol % of catalyst with the concentration
of 0.5 mM) at room temperature using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
These conversion curves used CDCl3 to facilitate 1H NMR analyses. The activities of the Grubbs third-generation catalysts 11 and 12 containing PIB-bound pyridine ligands
were then monitored using 1H NMR spectroscopy by observing
the disappearance of the norbornene alkene peak at 6.23 ppm and the
appearance of the alkene peak at 5.55 ppm for the polynorbornene product
(Scheme 2). The conversion
of 15 to polymer 16 was then plotted versus
time, as shown in Figure 5. The results showed that the Grubbs third-generation catalysts 11 and 12 containing PIB-bound pyridine ligands
possess the same activity as their low-molecular-weight counterparts
toward ROMP reaction of norbornene derivative 15. Grubbs
had previously noted that the initiation rate of ROMP reactions catalyzed
by Grubbs third-generation catalysts depends on the dissociation rate
of the pyridine ligand. In low-molecular-weight complexes,
the dissociation rate of the pyridine ligand increases with electron-deficient
pyridine ligands and the rate of the ROMP reaction increases.13 This same effect was observed in ROMP chemistry
of 15 catalyzed by a 3-bromopyridine complex of Grubbs
third-generation catalyst 14 (Figure 4).

catalysts 13 and 14.

(b) 12 (filled circles) compared with those catalyzed
by 14 (open circles).

Scheme 2 Polymerization of 15 by Catalysts 11, 12, 13, or 14
An important property of Grubbs
third-generation ruthenium catalysts
is their ability to control molecular weight of the polymer product.25 Because one metal center generates only one
polymer chain, the molecular weight of the polymer product can be
controlled by adjusting the monomer to catalyst ratio. To show that
this same effect is observed with a Grubbs third-generation catalyst
containing PIB-bound pyridine ligands, we carried out five different
ROMP reactions of norbornene derivative 15 polymerized
by Grubbs third-generation catalyst 12 containing 3-bromo-4-polyisobutylpyridine
ligands. These reactions were carried out in DCM using, 2, 1.5, 1,
0.5, and 0.28 mol % of 12. DCM was used because this
solvent was used in prior work with catalysts 13 and 14. The resulting molecular weights of polymer products increased
proportionally to the ratio of the monomer to catalyst 12. A plot of the molecular weights of the polymer product versus the
monomer to catalyst ratio (Figure 6) shows that the ROMP reaction of 15 using
catalyst 12 was controllable in the same way as the ROMP
reaction using the 4-bromopyridine-ligated Ru complex 14 (Scheme 3).

Figure 6 Plot of the
molecular weight of polymer 17 product
vs the ratio of monomer 15 to catalyst 12.

Scheme 3 Polymerization of 15 by
Catalyst 12
To test the utility of PIB-bound pyridine ligands in the
separation
of the Ru catalyst residue from polymer products, we carried out an
ROMP reaction of 15 using 1 mol % of 12 in
DCM at room temperature for 1 h. This polymerization was quenched
using a 38-fold excess of butyl vinyl ether. This quenching, which
is typically used in ROMP chemistry, produces an inactive Ru complex.
The polymer product was isolated by precipitation using a 10-fold
excess of hexane because hexane was used as a precipitation solvent
in prior work.26 This polymer product was
then analyzed for the presence of ruthenium content using ICP-MS and
the PDI of the product was analyzed using GPC. The ICP-MS analysis
showed that the ruthenium contaminant content in polymer prepared
from 12 was 159 ppm (approximately 3.1% of the charged
Ru). The PDI of the polymer was 1.07, which is comparable to those
polymers prepared with low-molecular-weight Grubbs third-generation
catalyst 14 (PDI < 1.10).25 A second polymerization of another monomer 18 was carried
out using 12, using the same procedure as was used in
the polymerization of 15 with complex 12 (Scheme 4). Polymer
product 19 derived from monomer 18 was again
isolated by the same sort of precipitation used in prior work. The
polymer product was then analyzed using ICP-MS and GPC. In this case,
polymer 19 had a Ru contaminant level of 156 ppm (approximately
3.1% of the charged Ru). The PDIof polymer 19 was 1.05.

Scheme 4 ROMP Reactions of 15 and 18 Catalyzed by 12, 14, or 22
To compare these results with the results of
ROMP polymer products
prepared from Grubbs third-generation catalyst 14, the
polymerization of 15 and 18 to form polymers 17 and 19 was carried out. These polymers were
isolated by precipitation in a 10-fold excess of methanol because
the low-molecular-weight catalyst is insoluble in hexane and would
coprecipitate with the product. In these experiments, the product
from the PIB-bound catalysts was visually water white solids whereas
the precipitated products formed using 14 were grayish.
ICP-MS analysis were carried out and showed that the polymers prepared
using the PIB-supported Ru catalyst 12 had lower Ru contamination
(159 and 156 ppm, respectively) than was observed in products prepared
from a nonsupported Grubbs third-generation catalyst 14 (823 and 821 ppm). This leaching of approximately 3% of the charged
Ru for 12 versus 16% of the charged Ru for 14 shows that these PIB-bound pyridines are effective at separating
Ru catalyst residues from polymer products.

Our earlier studies
had explored the utility of other oligomer-supported
catalysts. Specifically, we had previously examined the utility of
PE- and PIB-supported NHC ligands as phase anchors that could decrease
Ru contamination in polymer products of ROMP reactions. For example,
an ROMP reaction with the Ru complex 21 that contained
a PIB-bound NHC ligand produced polymer products with 1.0%–9.2%
leaching of the charged Ru.14 The Ru leaching
was visually lower than Ru contamination from products with a low-molecular-weight
catalyst in that the initially isolated polymer products were not
grayish solids. In those cases, the polymer product was separated
from a CH2Cl2 solution of the polymer by hexane
precipitation. Although the Ru contamination,
in our most successful cases, only approximately 0.50% of the charged
Ru leached in a polymerization reaction when a Ru complex formed with
a PEOlig-bound NHC ligand was used at 80 °C in conjunction
with a PEOlig as a cosolvent.27 In that experiment, the catalyst and the cosolvent were both insoluble
solids after the reaction whereas the polymer products remained in
the solution.

Because PIB-bound NHC ligands are effective at
separating Ru catalyst
residues in Ru-catalyzed ROMP chemistry, we decided to test that if
using PIB-bound pyridines along with PIB-bound NHC ligands in a Ru
complex could result in an even lower Ru contamination in the polymer
products. To test this hypothesis, we prepared PIB-quad-supported
Grubbs third-generation catalyst 22 and used this catalyst
to prepare polymers 17 and 19.

The
synthesis of PIB-quad-supported Grubbs third-generation catalyst 22 was carried out from PIB-supported Grubbs second-generation
catalyst 21 that was prepared using a reported procedure.14 In our hands, the conversion of 21 to 22 was synthetically challenging, and the desired
PIB-quad-supported Grubbs third-generation catalyst 22 was synthesized from catalyst 21 with PIB-supported
picoline 10 in the presence of CuCl at 40 °C for
30 min only on a 0.01 mmol scale. The conversion of catalyst 21 to the presumed complex 22 was confirmed using 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopy, and the product
thus formed was used directly in a polymerization reaction.

The synthesis as shown in Scheme 5 of imidazolium salt 20 had been carried
out previously.12 However, in our earlier
work, the conversion of 20 into PIB-supported Grubbs
second-generation catalyst 21 is experimentally difficult
because catalyst 21 is not especially stable. While catalyst 21 was characterized using 1H, 13C,
and 31P NMR spectroscopy, our only successful synthesis
of 22 was carried out on a 0.01 mmol scale. The conversion
of 21 into the presumed product 22 was confirmed
using 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solution
of approximately 0.01 mmol of 22 thus formed was then
directly used in a polymerization reaction. Overall, the synthesis
of 22 is much more difficult than the synthesis of 11 or 12.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of PIB-Quad-Supported Grubbs
Third-Generation Catalyst 22
With 22 in hand, we were able to test whether
the
extra PIB ligands in 22 significantly reduce Ru leaching
into the polymer products. This hypothesis was tested using ROMP reactions
of norbornene 15 and oxanorbornene 18 with
1 mol % of 22 in DCM at room temperature. The polymers
formed in this reaction were isolated on the same scale, and in the
same way, we isolated polymer products prepared using 12. Polymer products 17 and 19 were white
solids that were analyzed using GPC, 1H NMR spectroscopy,
and ICP-MS (Table 1). These analyses showed that products from 12 or 22 were similar. There was a slightly lower yield of products
when using 22, and the Ru contamination in polymer products 17 and 19 prepared using 22 was
slightly lower. The estimated Ru leaching assumption was 1.8% or 1.7%
of the charged Ru, respectively, assuming that the crude catalyst 22 used had formed in 100% yield from complex 21. Catalyst 22 does afford product with low dispersity
and with lower leaching. However, if a low dispersity polymer product
is the goal with modest Ru leaching, the simpler catalysts 11 and 12 would be preferable in our opinion because of
the difficulty in the synthesis of catalyst 22.

If Ru contamination in the product
were the sole consideration,
schemes that use a PEOlig cosolvent and PEOlig-supported NHC–Ru complexes to prepare ROMP products 17 and 19 are more effective at reducing Ru contamination
in the polymer products24 than schemes
that use catalysts 12 and 22. However, catalysts
such as 12 and 22 that do not use polyethylene
cosolvent could have broader substrate utility as they avoid the need
for the higher reaction temperature necessary when using a polyethylene
solvent and PEOlig-bound ligand and avoid the need for
a multistep synthesis of the PEOlig-bound NHC ligands and
the difficulty in the synthesis of 22.

Conclusions
The results in this study show that the phase selectively soluble
PIB-bound pyridine ligands are effective additives in controlling
the ROMP activity of Ru–NHC catalyst complexes. Both 4-polyisobutylpyridine
and 4-polyisobutyl-3-bromopyridine ligands are readily synthesized
and both significantly reduce Ru catalyst residues in polymer products.
Although the Ru contamination in products is not as low as that can
be obtained with Ru catalysts that contain polyethylene ligands, the
Ru contamination is in the same 2%–3% range as that which is
obtained with PIB-bound NHC ligands. These PIB-bound pyridines provide
the same benefits of control over polymer chain growth and the product
dispersity as their low-molecular-weight analogs. Overall, they are
a relatively simple way to separate Ru catalyst residues from product,
and they provide the same excellent control over polymer dispersity
and ROMP catalyst activity as their low-molecular-weight counterparts.
Although these ligands are labile ligands unlike the NHC ligand, they
are as effective at generating separable metal complexes as less labile
catalyst ligands that are more typically used for immobilization and
separation. The success of the separations with these PIB-bound pyridine
ligands with ROMP catalysts suggests that other catalyst separations
also need not use strongly or always coordinated ligands, especially
in these cases, where a weakly coordinating ligand is expected to
be attached to the metal after the reaction.
