The color generating from the biochemical reaction between
3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
and Lysine@WS2 QDs was used a signal for the detection
of hydrogen peroxide. The QDs were prepared using a combination of
techniques, that is, probe sonication and hydrothermal treatment.
Analysis via UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive spectroscopy,
and transmission electron microscopy yielded detailed information
on the nature and characteristics of these quantum dots. Furthermore,
as-synthesized quantum dots were studied for their capability to mimic
peroxidase enzyme using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
as a substrate. Consequently, a colorimetric sensor utilizing Lysine@WS2 QDs could detect hydrogen peroxide in a range of 0.1–60
μM with a response time of 5 min. The same material was used
for H2O2 detection using impedance spectroscopy,
which yielded a dynamic range of 0.1–350 μM with a response
time of 30–40 s.

1 Introduction
Reactive oxygen species
are important messengers in signaling cascades
and control the environment around a cell. Although their presence
is very important for a cell, high levels of these species cause oxidative
stress.1 Oxidative stress is an imbalance
between the antioxidant defense system and production of reactive
oxygen species.2 Oxidative stress causes
oxidation of various biomolecules such as DNA, proteins, fatty acids,
and amino acids, which leads to diseases like cardiovascular disease,
neurological disorders, diabetes, and even cancer.3,4 Many
biomarkers are responsible for oxidative stress, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal,5 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8oxodG),6 5-chlorocytosine,7 5-chlorouracil,8 3-nitro-tyrosine (3-NO-Tyr),9 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)10 to name a few. H2O2 is a well-established oxidative stress biomarker and has
been found to be associated with malignancies amongst other diseases.11,12 Therefore, monitoring of oxidative stress biomarkers, especially
H2O2, is of clinical relevance.

Current
methods of H2O2 detection in biological
systems are either based on enzymatic reactions13 or use fluorescent tags14,15 for signal
amplification. Enzymatic reactions are sometimes difficult to monitor
because the compounds formed during the reaction degrade rapidly.16 The use of fluorescent tags, though, allows
the detection of H2O2 in subcellular compartments17 but the synthesis of these tags is very difficult
and expensive. To overcome the limitations of such conventionally
used methods, new potential substitutes must be looked for.

Nanoparticles, in the recent past, have been found to be good candidates
for the enzyme mimetic activity,18−23 as explored by researchers for various applications. Platinum nanoparticles,24 iron core/carbon shell,25 cobalt oxide (Co3O4),26 silver phosphate (Ag3PO4),27 iron-doped zinc sulfide quantum dots,28 nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots,29 and gold nanorices30 have been
reported to possess peroxidase-like activity. Transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) such as tungsten disulfide nanosheets (WS2 NS) have
also been recently reported to possess peroxidase activity.31,32 TMDs are known to possess little or no cytotoxic effects and are
therefore considered safe for in vivo biomedical applications.33 Regarding hydrogen peroxide detection using
artificial enzymes, only few reports are available on combined optical
and electrochemical-based systems.

In the present work, the
ability of lysine-functionalized tungsten
disulfide quantum dots (Lysine@WS2 QDs) to mimic peroxidase
enzyme for hydrogen peroxide detection has been studied using both
optical and electrochemical techniques. Results of this study indicated
that the lysine-stabilized and functionalized WS2 QDs have
the ability to convert 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB), a substrate of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme, into a
blue-colored product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The absorbance of this product shows a prominent
absorbance peak at 652 nm because of formation of a charge-transfer
complex product. This was used as an optical signal for the estimation
of hydrogen peroxide. The advantage of this method is the replacement
of the peroxidase enzyme, as the enzymes generally require controlled
storing conditions to keep their activity intact. The replacement
of the enzyme with an artificial enzyme is advantageous in terms of
its rugged usage. The current work also reports use of Lysine@WS2 QDs for the detection of hydrogen peroxide using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Impedance studies were found to be more
sensitive as compared to the optical detection of hydrogen peroxide.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Lysine@WS2 QDs
2.1.1 Morphological Characterization
Figure 1a–f
shows EDS, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and elemental mapping
of Lysine@WS2 QDs. The elemental mapping of Lysine@WS2 QDs clearly shows the presence of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,
tungsten, and sulfur. The carbon content can be due to carbon-coated
grids used for imaging and oxygen is attributed to the atmosphere.
The nitrogen, tungsten, and sulfur contents are contributed by lysine
and tungsten disulfide quantum dots. The inset of Figure 1a shows the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of functionalized
quantum dots, which shows nearly spherical-shaped & well-dispersed
quantum dots having an average particle size of 4–6 nm. Figure 1b–f shows
mapping of individual elements.

elements including carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, tungsten, and sulfur.

2.1.2 Spectroscopic Characterization
The synthesis of Lysine@WS2 QDs was further confirmed
by studying their absorbance behavior (Figure 2a). The figure shows that little absorbance
is observed in case of non-functionalized WS2 QDs, which
is expected from this class of material.34 However, on closer examination of the spectrum, it was found that
a small peak near 280 nm was present, which matches well with the
previous report.35 The Lysine@WS2 QDs, however, exhibited a prominent hump at 225 nm, which can be
attributed to the absorbance of the lysine molecule. Lysine, though,
is known to exhibit absorbance at 270 nm not because of the presence
of any chromophore, but a possible role of the −NH2 moiety is anticipated. In literature, to date, no explanation for
the signature around 300–350 nm was found. A possible explanation
could be the presence of additional functional groups at the surface
of the QDs, as shown by Xu et al.36 The
blue shift evident in the present data can be explained by quantum
confinement effects, which are primarily observed in these quantum
dots and is dependent on the material properties. If particles are
in the quantum dot size regime, the band gap between the valence band
and the conduction band increases. This implies that smaller particles
have a large band gap. Conversely, a larger particle will have a smaller
value of band gap.37 The optical band gaps
for bare WS2 QDs and Lysine@WS2 QDs were determined
using Tauc plots, in which hν on the x-axis was plotted against (αhν)1/r on the y-axis. The value
of r was derived as 1/2 for direct allowed transitions
(data not shown). It was observed that the bare QDs had a band gap
of 4.90 eV, whereas functionalized QDs exhibited 5.11 eV, which indicates
that the functionalized QDs are smaller in size as compared to bare
QDs.

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis, (b) FTIR, and (c) Raman spectra of WS2 QDs & Lysine@WS2 QDs.

The presence of various functional groups in synthesized
material
was confirmed from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
and the result is shown in Figure 2b. Bare WS2 QDs showed peaks corresponding
to O–H stretching and W–S stretching at 3200 and 500
cm–1. The Lysine@WS2 QDs, on the other
hand, showed all characteristic peaks corresponding to the presence
of lysine and other probable functional groups. The peaks around 3070,
2834, 1741, 1648, 1289, and 475 cm–1 correspond
to O–H stretching, C–H stretching, C=O stretching,
N–H stretching, C–N stretching, and W–S stretching,
respectively.34,38 The peak corresponding to W–S
stretching got shifted to 475 cm–1, in case of Lysine@WS2 QDs.

Figure 2c shows
the Raman spectra of functionalized and non-functionalized WS2 QDs. In general, the Raman spectrum of bulk WS2 shows two peaks at around 363 and 429 cm–1. These
peaks correspond to two phonon modes of 2H-WS2, that is,
E2g1 and A1g, respectively.39 The E2g1 phonon mode corresponds
to in-plane optical mode, whereas A1g is an out-of-plane
vibration of the sulfur atoms.40 In case
of non-functionalized quantum dots, no such peaks are observed, which
can be due to absence of layer to layer interactions, which are basically
responsible for the signal in Raman spectroscopy.41 However, the Raman spectrum of functionalized quantum dots
showed the presence of two major peaks at 1100 and 1156 cm–1 corresponding to C–H bonds and N–H bonds, respectively.
This confirms the presence of the amine functional group on quantum
dots.42,43

2.1.3 Crystallographic and Surface Tension Measurements
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of functionalized and non-functionalized
quantum dots is shown in Figure 3a. The pattern shows the polycrystalline nature of
the synthesized material as is evident from the broad peak obtained
at around 14°, corresponding to (002) plane. The presence of
the (002) plane indicates the formation of a monolayer or bilayer
WS2, which is a characteristic nature of this class of
material.44,45 The XRD pattern of Lysine@WS2 QDs is also similar, which confirms that the polycrystalline behavior
of QDs remains intact even after the functionalization.

Figure 3 (a) XRD Pattern
of functionalized and non-functionalized WS2 QDs, (b) surface
tension measurement of lysine, WS2 QDs, & Lysine@WS2 QDs, (c) CV of sequentially modified
electrode in buffer containing [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–, and (d) Nyquist plot of the sequentially modified electrode in
buffer containing [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–.

The crystallite size was calculated from the Scherrer
equation46 using the XRD pattern and was
found to be around
6 nm, which is in the quantum domain. From Bragg’s Law,47 the lattice spacing (d), lattice parameters
“c” & “a” were also calculated for the (002) plane and found to be
5.97, 2.985, and 11.94 Å, respectively. These results are as
per the hexagonal crystal of WS2, confirming the lattice
parameters a = b and a = 4c.

Surface tension measurements were also
performed for lysine-functionalized
and non-functionalized WS2 QDs. The study is important
because enzymes such as HRP show maximum activity either by modifying
it appropriately or by using some organic solvents only.48 This can be dealt with by developing a system
or platform, which can show HRP-like catalytic activity even in other
solvents. With an assumption that functionalized WS2 QDs
can mimic the HRP, their surface tension was studied with the result
shown in Figure 3b.
The surface tension of non-functionalized WS2 QDs was found
to be 81.79 mN/m and surface tension value of lysine was 28.80 mN/m.
Lysine@WS2 QDs showed surface tension value to be 48.02
mN/m, which is much less than that of WS2 QDs. The study
shows a significant reduction in surface tension values after functionalization,
which confirmed the development of a highly hydrophilic system. This
reduction in surface tension is similar to chemical surfactants, which
are generally used for synthesis of WS2 QDs. Hence, it
can be concluded that lysine has a potential to be a viable replacement
of surfactants, which are being used for the synthesis of WS2 QDs.49

2.1.4 Electrochemical Characterization
The electrochemical behavior of sequentially modified electrodes,
namely, bare screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE), SPE/lysine, SPE/WS2 QDs, and SPE/Lysine@WS2 QDs, respectively, was
also recorded using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS. Figure 3c shows results of CV studies
at the electrodes mentioned above. As compared to the bare electrode,
the lysine-modified electrode showed a decreased current value. In
another set of experiments, the quantum dots-modified electrodes showed
an enhanced current value, which might be due to the activation of
a fast charge transfer in presence of quantum dots.50

The diffusion
constant for all the above-mentioned electrochemical systems was calculated
using Randles–Sevcik equation51  where Ip is the
observed current, n is the number of electrons, A is the area of an electrode (0.071 cm2), C is the concentration of redox species (1 mM), υ
is the scan rate (0.60 V·s–1), and D is the diffusion constant.

The diffusion constant
“D” was calculated
and found to be 4.927 × 10–3, 5.328 ×
10–3, and 6.290 × 10–3 and
4.206 × 10–3 cm2 s–1 for bare, WS2 QDs, Lysine@WS2 QDs, and lysine-modified
electrodes, respectively. This clearly suggests that in case of Lysine@WS2 QDs-modified electrode, the current is diffusing at a much
faster pace as compared to other modified electrodes.

A Brown–Anson
model52 was used
to calculate the surface coverage of films of various materials (WS2 QDs, lysine and Lysine@WS2 QDs) on the electrode.
This was calculated using the formula53  where n is the number of
electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant
(96 584 C mol–1), I* is
the surface coverage of the film (mol·cm–2), A is the surface area of an electrode (0.071 cm2), V is the scan rate (0.60 V·s–1), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1·K–1), and T is the absolute
temperature (298 K). The surface coverage (I*) was
calculated and found to be 2.828 × 10–8, 3.306
× 10–8, 4.608 × 10–8, and 2.060 × 10–8 mol·cm–2 for bare, WS2 QDs, Lysine@WS2 QDs, and lysine-modified
electrodes, respectively. Modifying the electrode with Lysine@WS2 QDs clearly gives better surface coverage, which in turn
will provide more electroactive sites for the reaction to happen.

The ratio of Ipa/Ipc gives an additional information on reversibility of
the reaction, which was also calculated for respective electrodes.
The ratio is calculated and found to be 1.106, 1.091, 1.032, and 1.090
for bare, WS2 QDs, Lysine@WS2 QDs, and lysine-modified
electrodes, respectively. The value closer to 1.0 indicates that the
reaction is reversible. In our case, the Lysine@WS2 QDs-modified
electrode gives the value closest to 1.0 and, hence, follows a reversible
reaction model.

In electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the
plot between imaginary
and real impedance is referred to as the Nyquist plot. The Nyquist
plot is a semicircle for electron-transfer-limited reactions and if
the reaction has a diffusion-controlled process as well, then the
semicircle is accompanied with a linear portion also.54 The diameter of the semicircle is significant for data
interpretation. The greater the diameter, more is the impedance. Figure 3d shows the Nyquist
plot of all electrodes. The results show that the obtained Nyquist
plot has both semicircle as well as linear line, which indicates that
the reaction is diffusion-controlled. Among all the Nyquist plots,
the diameter of the semicircle for Lysine@WS2 QDs-modified
electrodes is found to be the smallest. This ensures a fast electron-transfer.

2.2 Peroxidase Activity of Lysine@WS2 QDs
Before studying the peroxidase activity of synthesized
material, fluorescence studies were also performed; just in case if
their fluorescent properties can be useful is shown in Figure 4a. It was observed that as
the excitation wavelength was increased, (from 300 to 360 nm), the
photoluminescence intensity also increased, and the maximum emission
was obtained at 450 nm. At higher excitation wavelengths (370–400
nm), the intensity decreased with red shift in the emission spectrum.
The result matches well with the previous reports.55,56

of different reaction mixtures (A: lysine WS2 QDs, B: TMB
+ H2O2, C: TMB + Lysine@WS2 QDs,
D: TMB + Lysine@WS2 QDs + H2O2).

2.2.1 Reaction Mechanism of Lysine@WS2 QDs-Catalyzed H2O2-TMB Reaction
The
peroxidase activity of the Lysine@WS2 QDs was investigated
in terms of its catalytic ability to oxidize the TMB (chromogenic
substrate) in the presence of H2O2. Generally,
the TMB gets oxidized during the enzymatic degradation of H2O2 by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The one electron oxidation
of TMB results in a radical cation that forms a charge transfer complex
with unoxidized compound. This charge-transfer complex absorbs at
652 nm. The completely oxidized form (diimine) absorbs at 450 nm,
which is formed by two sequential one-electron oxidation of TMB. The
peroxidase activity of the synthesized Lysine@WS2 QDs can
possibly be explained by formation of the charge-transfer complex
between negatively charged Lysine@WS2 QDs and positively
charged TMB. The schematic of chemical reaction is shown in Figure 4b.

The chemical
reaction between H2O2, TMB, and quantum dots
results in the formation of a blue-colored product, which is expected
to be formed by charge-transfer complex formation between diimine
and diimine oxidation products, as mentioned above. The quantum dots
catalyze the oxidation of TMB by reacting with H2O2 and produce the color. This complex gives absorption peaks
at 450 and 652 nm.57 In our present work
also, both the peaks could be observed (Figure 4c) and the absorbance peak obtained at 652
nm has been used as a signal for monitoring the reaction. To confirm
the role of quantum dots in the catalytic reaction, different sets
of experiments were conducted, with different reaction mixtures, namely,
only Lysine@WS2 QDs, TMB + H2O2,
TMB + Lysine@WS2 QDs, TMB + H2O2 +
Lysine@WS2 QDs. Except in the TMB + H2O2 + Lysine@WS2 QDs reaction mixture, the blue color
did not appear (Figure 4d) and hence no peaks were observed. In the TMB + H2O2 + Lysine@WS2 QDs reaction mixture, blue color
was generated as a result of which the prominent peak at 652 nm is
observed (Figure 4d).
This confirms the role of Lysine@WS2 QDs as a peroxidase-mimicking
material. The study interestingly showed that the individual entities,
namely, lysine and quantum dots did not show the peroxidase activity.
The hybrid of two in the form of functionalized quantum dots however
showed peroxidase activity. WS2 QDs possess intrinsic peroxidase
activity, which has been reported in previous reports also. This can
be due to quick transfer of the electrons in the material. Lysine
however does not possess any peroxidase activity. Hoewever, the combination
of lysine with WS2 QDs generated amine groups on the QDs.
The lone pore of electrons in these amine groups enhanced the intrinsic
peroxidase activity of the WS2 QDs and hence more color
generation was observed when using TMB.

2.2.2 Colorimetric Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide
The synthesized Lysine@WS2 QDs were studied for their
capability to mimic the catalytic activity of peroxidase enzyme for
H2O2 estimation. For this, varying concentrations
of H2O2 were added to the reaction mixture containing
a 200 μL TMB (4 mM) and a 40 μL of Lysine@WS2 QDs sample. The experiment was conducted five times (n = 5). The samples were incubated for 5 min and then their absorbance
recorded (Figure 5a).
The inset in Figure 5a shows the color variation in the reaction solution at various hydrogen
peroxide concentrations. The absorbance at 652 nm increased with increase
in H2O2 concentration. The linearity is obtained
in the range 0.1–60 μM with a regression value of 0.9803
from 10−60 μM (Figure 5b). Table 1 shows a comparison of linearity obtained with other catalysts
as artificial or enzyme-mimicking materials. The current work shows
better results in comparison to previous reports on peroxidase activity
for hydrogen peroxide detection in terms of a broad linear range (0.1–60
μM) and a short response time (5 min), result discussed in coming
sections.

In most of the earlier reports, the color development
with the
enzyme-mimicking took more time.58,59 Authors60,61 though reported broader range with WS2 nanosheets but
again the reaction was time-taking.

Liu et al. and Wu et al.
used poly[2-(3-thienyl)ethyloxy-4-butylsulfonate]
and gold nanoparticles, respectively, as enzyme mimics. The linearity
range obtained was narrow as well as the response time was longer.62,64 Although Guo et al.65 demonstrated that
iron oxide-graphene (Fe2O3- graphene)-based
nanostructures could show response in 3 min, the dynamic range reported
by them is very narrow, that is, 0.2–10.0 μM. In the
graphene oxide-platinum nickel hybrid (GO-PtNi) work, the system had
a working range from 80 to 1500 μM, which, although very broad,
is not able to detect the concentration ranges below 1 μM.

2.2.3 Optimization of Experimental Conditions
The reaction conditions such as response time, TMB concentration,
Lysine@WS2 QDs volume, temperature, and pH were optimized.
For the response time study, the reaction was monitored from 0 to
1200 s and the response was recorded for both WS2 QDs and
Lysine@WS2 QDs. In WS2 QDs, moreover the intensity
of color generated was very less as compared to color generated with
functionalized QDs. Also, non-functionalized QDs showed a response
time of 700 s (approx. 12 min), whereas the functionalized QDs showed
a reaction time of about 300 s only (Figure 6a). The reaction was constant up to 900 s
and thereafter a decrease in the absorbance of colored compound was
observed. Hence, for further reactions, the optimum reaction time
was kept as 5 min.

reaction. (e) Effect of pH. (f) Effect of temperature. (g) Reproducibility
study.(h) Effect of interfering species.

The result of effect of TMB concentration on chemical
reaction
is shown in Figure 6b,c. The concentration was varied from 3 to 12 mM. From 3 to 9 mM
concentration of TMB, the response increased linearly with R2 value of 0.98 but after that, the response
started decreasing. For final studies, 4 mM concentration of TMB was
used to ensure minimum use of constituents.

The concentration
of Lysine@WS2 QDs was also optimized.
For this, the volume of Lysine@WS2 QDs was varied from
10 to 90 μL. The maximum absorbance was obtained with 40 μL
(Figure 6d); thereafter,
a decrease in absorbance was observed. Hence, 40 μL was selected
as the optimum value for further studies.

Variation in the pH
value results in a large change in the enzymatic
activity;66 thereafter, the effect of pH
on catalytic reaction was studied. The plot of pH versus absorbance
is shown in Figure 6e. The maximum absorbance was obtained at a pH value of 4.0, which
might be because the equilibrium shifts toward the charge transfer
complex (at 652 nm) instead of the imine complex (at 450 nm), thus
leading to the formation of a more prominent charge-transfer complex
than imine complex and hence a more dominant blue color, which implies
that the acidic pH condition favors formation of the charge-transfer
complex, whereas an alkaline pH condition leads to formation of an
imine complex.67 This trend is in line
with earlier reported peroxidase mimics. The previous report of WS2 nanosheets having peroxidase activity also displayed maximum
activity at pH 4.0.61 Yao et al. in their
work showed that iron sulfide nanowires had the potential as a peroxidase
mimetic having maximum activity at a pH value of 4.0.68 Vanadium oxide-mesoporous carbon composite showed peroxidase
activity for detection of glucose. This material also showed maximum
catalytic activity at pH 4.0.7

The
change in temperature profile and its respective effect on
catalytic reaction was studied to understand the dependence of reaction
on temperature. The temperature was varied from 0 to 80 °C and
the maximum absorbance was achieved at 37 °C (Figure 6f). All the identically prepared
sets showed similar absorption values at 652 nm as shown in Figure 6g. A good reproducibility
is obtained with the developed enzyme-mimicking quantum dots, which
has been concluded by monitoring the absorbance of identically prepared
five sets.

In the human body, various agents similar in function
to H2O2 exist, which may or may not interfere
in the
peroxidase activity of Lysine@WS2 QDs. Thus, the interference
study was also performed. For this, ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine
(DA) were used as interfering agents. AA, DA, and AA + DA were added
to the reaction mixture having 200 μL of TMB (4 mM), 50 μL
of H2O2, and 40 μL of the Lysine@WS2 QDs sample. The presence of AA, DA, or both in the reaction
mixture did not interfere with the peroxidase activity of the Lysine@WS2 QDs as presented in Figure 6h. Hence, the system can be reported as highly selective
toward hydrogen peroxide.

2.2.4 Detection of H2O2 in
Urine Samples
Real sample analysis was done using urine samples.
Direct urine did not give any reaction, which might be due to the
absence of H2O2 in urine. Hence, the urine sample
was spiked with known concentrations of H2O2 (50, 60, 100, 110 μM) and the reaction conditions were kept
as 200 μL of TMB (4 mM), 50 μL of spiked urine sample,
and 40 μL of the Lysine@WS2 QDs sample. The result
is shown in Table 2.  

Table 2 Analysis of H2O2 Concentration in the Spiked Urine Sample (n = 4)
Absorbance of H2O2 added (from standard curve)	Absorbance
of H2O2 recovered	% Recovery	
0.396 (50 μM)	0.405	102.27	
0.400 (60 μM)	0.437	109.25	
0.441 (100 μM)	0.438	99.31	
0.457 (110 μM)	0.511	111.81	
With spiked samples also, the sensor showed a linear
response with
increase in spike concentration.

2.3 Electrochemical Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide
The developed Lysine@WS2 QDs were used for electrochemical
detection of hydrogen peroxide also for which impedance spectroscopy
was employed. For this, the quantum dots were drop-casted on SPE and
air-dried. This modified electrode was then used for impedance measurements.
The impedance response is recorded in the form of a Nyquist plot. Figure 7 shows the Nyquist
plot recorded with Lysine@WS2 QDs/SPE electrodes as a function
of H2O2 concentration (0.1–350 μM).
The diameter of the semicircle decreased as the concentration of H2O2 increased, which might be due to enhanced electrochemical
activity of H2O2 in the case of QDs. This trend
continued from 0.1 to 350 μM. This linear range is much better
than that obtained with colorimetry. In pH studies, the diameter of
the semicircle decreased when moving from 2.0 to 7.0 pH in the range;
thereafter, it increased dramatically. The abrupt increase in the
diameter of the semicircle of the Nyquist plot can be because at alkaline
pH, hydrogen peroxide decomposes into H+ and perhydroxyl.
The perhydroxyl results in the formation of free radicals, which cause
an obstruction to the flow of current to the electrode, thereby increasing
the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot.69 Another assumption is that as ferro-ferri is used as the
redox marker, the iron in contact with the H2O2 can form insoluble iron hydroxide,70 which
can create hindrance in the electron flow and hence more impedance
is observed. Figure 7c,d shows the Nyquist plot for reproducibility and interference study.
In impedance study also, the electrodes showed good reproducibility
and selectivity.

All the nanostructures reported for electrochemical sensing of hydrogen
peroxide have narrow working range as compared to the current study
as shown in Table 3. In earlier reports, the researchers reveal H2O2 using polyoxometalate-grafted graphene nanohybrid worked in the
higher concentration ranges (100–20 mM), but did not mention
the utility of this nanostructure in lower hydrogen peroxide concentration
values.

3 Material and Methods
3.1 Materials
Tungsten (IV) sulfide nanopowder
(90 nm average particle size), TMB (≥99%), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) pellets, l-Lysine monohydrochloride were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (India) and were used as received. Hydrogen peroxide
(30%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were procured from Merck (India).
Potassium ferrocyanide [K4Fe(CN)6] and potassium
ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] were purchased from
HiMedia, (India). SPEs having a working diameter of 3 mm with an area
of 0.071 cm2 were purchased from Zensor (Taiwan) and were
used for electrochemical studies. Deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ),
obtained from Millipore Integral System (USA), was used to prepare
all the aqueous solutions required during experimentation. The solutions
and glassware were autoclaved prior to being used. All the solutions
were kept at 4 °C before experimentation. The TMB solution (10
mM) was prepared by dissolving 24 mg of TMB in 10 mL of deionized
water. This was used as stock solution and was diluted for experimentation
purpose. The TMB solution was kept in the dark at 4 °C to avoid
its oxidation in the presence of light. Stock solution of hydrogen
peroxide (1 mM) was prepared in deionized water and diluted further
for experimentation purpose. Interference study was conducted by using
interferents such as AA and DA obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (India).
Dibasic potassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and potassium
dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) salts were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (India) for preparing phosphate buffer (PB) solutions.

3.2 Characterization of Lysine@WS2 QDs
The optical characterization and monitoring of enzyme-like catalytic
reactions were performed on UV–visible spectrophotometer [Hitachi,
model U3900H, Japan]. To study the photoluminescence properties of
the quantum dots, a multimode plate reader (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax
i3x, USA) was used. The functional groups of the synthesized material
were analyzed using FTIR spectrometer [PerkinElmer, Model Spectrum-II,
USA]. The diffraction pattern was obtained using an X-ray diffractometer
[Bruker, model D8 ADVANCE, Germany]. A Raman analyzer [Renishaw, UK]
was used to record Raman spectra. TEM analysis was done on [FEI, Model
TECNAI G2F-20, USA]. The elemental composition of the synthesized
material was done using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) [Hitachi,
model SU8010, Japan]. Surface tension and contact angle measurements
for the synthesized material were conducted using a Drop Shape Analyzer
[Kruss, DSA-100E, Germany]. The electrochemical characterization and
hydrogen peroxide estimation were performed on electrochemical analyzer
[CH Instrument, model CHI660C, USA]. A probe sonicator [Helix Biosciences,
India] was used during the synthesis of material. Remi C-24 Plus [India]
was used for centrifugation purpose.

3.3 Synthesis of Lysine@WS2 QDs
For synthesis of lysine-functionalized WS2 QDs, the earlier
reported protocol was used with some modifications.49 Briefly, 300 mg of WS2 nanopowder and 150 mg
of l-lysine monohydrochloride were mixed in 100 mL of deionized
water. This was subjected to probe sonication for 3 h, followed by
hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 6 h in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave. After completion of reaction, the solution was allowed
to cool down naturally. The resulting solution was centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 30 min. These QDs are termed as Lysine@WS2 QDs in the paper.

3.4 Peroxidase Activity
The peroxidase-like
activity of Lysine@WS2 QDs was studied by monitoring the
oxidation of TMB in the presence of H2O2. The
catalytic reaction resulted in the formation of a blue-colored compound
(oxidized TMB), which shows an absorbance at 652 nm in spectroscopic
studies. For control experiments, a reaction was performed in the
absence of H2O2 and Lysine@WS2 QDs.
Every reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature (RT) for
5 min prior to absorbance measurements.

3.5 Colorimetric Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide
For the colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide, the reaction
mixtures consisting of H2O2, TMB, and QDs were
incubated at RT for 5 min and the absorbance of reaction product was
recorded. In this process, the concentrations of TMB, H2O2, and QDs were optimized by varying their respective
concentrations. The effect of varying pH, incubation time, and temperature
was also studied. The effect of pH was observed from 2 to 8. For incubation
time, the reaction was monitored up to 1200 s and the effect of temperature
was studied from 0 to 80 °C.

The effects of interfering
species, reproducibility, and real sample analysis were also observed.
For interference study, AA and DA were used.75 The reproducibility study was performed by monitoring the absorbance
of five identical sets of reaction. For real samples study, urine
sample was used. Prior to use, the urine sample was centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C followed by further filtration
using a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore) to remove any suspension
and kept at 4 °C. This urine sample was spiked with a different
hydrogen peroxide concentrations at 50, 60, 100, and 110 μM.

3.6 Electrochemical Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide
CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques
were used for electrochemical characterization of bare SPE, SPE/lysine,
SPE/WS2 QDs, and SPE/Lysine@WS2 QDs electrodes.
Ferro-ferri cyanide redox marker, prepared in PB, was used as an electrolyte
and redox marker. Electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide was
performed by using impedance spectroscopy. The measurements were recorded
in the frequency range of 1.0 to 100 000 Hz with an amplitude
of 0.005 V. The effect of pH, interferents, and reproducibility was
also studied for impedance measurements.

4 Conclusions
The current study aimed
at determining the ability of lysine-functionalized
WS2 QDs serving as peroxidase mimics. Although several
materials have been reported to mimic peroxidase activity, to date
the reported enzyme surrogates are characterized by an exceedingly
slow response. The Lysine@WS2 QDs developed in the present
study provided a response time of 5 min using colorimetric read-out
techniques at RT, whereas EIS yielded an even higher sensitivity at
a shorter response time of about 30–40 s only. Finally, the
application in real-world sample matrices confirmed the utility of
the developed enzyme mimics during the detection of hydrogen peroxide
in urine. Thus, it can be concluded that these QDs may effectively
be used as peroxidase-mimicking enzyme surrogates in hydrogen peroxide
detection schemes that work in real-world sample matrices.
