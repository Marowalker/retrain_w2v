Reaction
of α-methylstyrene in the presence of HI gas and methyl p-tolyl ketone selectively resulted in an internal olefinic
trimer. We revealed that the ketones with the stabilization of the
protonated state were efficient to give the corresponding trimers,
whereas the other ketones gave the usual indane compound. From the
investigation for the mechanistic path, we found that the trimer is
a kinetic product and that indane is a thermodynamic product.

==== Body
Introduction
Control of the reaction
of α-methylstyrenes under acidic conditions has attractive features
for the formation of polymers and oligomers. α-Methylstyrene
dimer (4-methyl-2,4-diphenylpent-1-ene) is utilized as a molecular
weight modifier.1 α-Methylstyrene
homopolymer is known to be difficult to form because of its low ceiling
temperature.2,3 However, it succeeded in the reaction
with HI/I2 as an initiator in liquid SO2 because
dormant (C–I-bonded compound) is activated by I2 to form cationic species.4 The indane
was obtained as a main product from the reaction of α-methylstyrene
with trifluoroacetic acid,5 whereas other
acids6−8 resulted mainly in three compounds: 2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-1-pentene,
2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-2-pentene, and 1,1,3-trimethyl-3-phenylindane.
Other conditions with acidic ionic liquids,9,10 molecular
sieves,11 acidic ion-exchange resins, and
clays8 also resulted in indane as a main
product.

We have been interested in the application of HI gas
for organic synthesis, and we reported the α-alkylated ketone
formation with two ketones12 and the indane
formation via styrene derivatives.13 We
attempted the reaction of the combination of ketone and styrene derivatives
to find the unique selective formation of indane (1)
and internal olefinic trimer (2), which was rarely obtained
in the acidic conditions. Herein, we report the formation of 2 with HI under solvent-free conditions. This reaction showed
the complete selectivity with or without methyl p-tolyl ketone (Scheme 1). In addition, we also revealed that 2 is a kinetic
product and 1 is a thermodynamic (equilibrium controlled)
product.

Scheme 1 Reaction of α-Methylstyrene Derivatives and HI with or
without Methyl p-Tolyl Ketone
Results and Discussion
We examined
the reaction of α-methylstyrene in the presence of 0.2 equiv
molar amounts of methyl p-tolyl ketone because the
reactivity of acetophenone was higher than that of α-methylstyrene
based on the yield of the product (6112 and 38%,13 respectively). When the reaction
was conducted with 1 equiv of HI gas based on α-methylstyrene
at 25 °C under solvent-free conditions, the indane derivative
(1a) was obtained in 51% yield as a major product and
the methyl p-tolyl ketone was completely recovered
(entry 1 in Table 1). By decreasing the amount of HI (entries 2–7), trimeric
compound (2a) was obtained in combination with dimeric
products (3 and 4). As a result, 2a was obtained as a major product with no formation of 1a in the case of the lower amount than 0.6 equivalent of HI. The formation
of 2a was reported as one of the mixture of trimers in
the reaction of α-methylstyrene with chloroacetic acid derivatives
by Kimura et al.14 Under our conditions,
constitutional isomers of 2a were not found in 1H NMR analysis. Collins et al. synthesized 2a by the
elimination of the corresponding alcohol.15 We varied the amount of ketone under 0.20 equivalent of HI. As a
result, the ketone in larger quantities than 0.1 equivalent amount
was efficient to form 2a (entries 8–11). No formation
of the α-alkylated ketone, 1,3-di(p-tolyl)butan-1-one,12 was observed even when 1 equivalent of methyl p-tolyl ketone was used (entry 8). From those results, we
found that a 1:1 ratio of HI and ketone is one of the best ratios
to produce 2a, considering the efficiency with the amount
of the introduced materials (entry 5). When the control experiment
was conducted without methyl p-tolyl ketone, the
reaction produced 1a with no formation of 2a, 3, or 4 (entry 13).

NMR using p-chlorobenzaldehyde as an internal standard.

Next, we examined various ketones
as an additive in this reaction (Table 2). Unique selectivity was observed by using methyl
tolyl ketone isomers. When o- and p-isomers were added, 2a was obtained as a major product
(entries 1 and 3). Contrarily, 1a was formed in the presence
of methyl m-tolyl ketone (entry 2). The addition
of acetophenone and benzophenone was ineffective in producing 2a (entries 4 and 5), but fluorenone was efficient for 2a (entry 6). When p-methoxyphenyl methyl
ketone was used, a lower yield of 2a was observed with 3 as a main product (entry 7). HI was well-known as a cleavage
reagent of the methoxy group.16 Thus, dissipation
of HI occurred to interrupt the formation of a trimer. When we treated
with p-chlorophenyl methyl ketone, 2a was still formed as a major product (entry 8). An aliphatic ketone
such as an acetone was insufficient to result in 2a (entry
9). We found that benzamide was capable of forming 2a, but that they gave a lower yield than that of methyl p-tolyl ketone (entry 10). In the case of addition of amines, higher
pKBH+ of conjugated acid in
dimethyl sulfoxide (9.0, 3.6, and 2.5 for trimethylamine, aniline, N,N-dimethylanilne, respectively)17 gave a higher yield of 2a (entries
11–13). However, the formation of 1a or the recovery
of α-methylstyrene were also observed. No formation of 1a and 2a was found in the case of phosphine
and sulfur oxides (entries 14 and 15). An aqueous solution of HI,
which means H2O as an additive, gave 2a in
52% yield with the concomitant with 1a (23%) (entry 16).
This result was a clear contrast in the case of using gaseous HI (entry
13 in Table 1). From
those results, one possibility that arose as a reason for occurring
selectively was the difference of the basicity of the additive. The
acidity of the conjugated acid of ketones was reviewed by Freiberg.18 The pKBH+ values for methyl p-tolyl ketone, acetophenone,
benzophenone, p-methoxyphenyl methyl ketone, p-chlorophenyl methyl ketone, and acetone19 were −4.02, −4.32, −4.95, −3.31,
−4.85, and −2.85, respectively, even though pKBH+ value was determined by fitting
into the Bunnett–Olsen equation20 in aqueous sulfuric acid. We could not find any relation between
pKBH+ value and the selectivity
in our investigation. Therefore, we suspected that the stabilization
of the protonated complex of the carbonyl moiety would be affected
to produce 2a. Methyl group on o- and p-position stabilized the positive charge on carbon at the
carbonyl group by an inductive effect and hyperconjugation. Chlorine
atoms also stabilized its positive charge by a mesomeric effect.

j 57 wt % aqueous HI (0.02 equiv)
was used instead of HI gas.

Furthermore, we examined the reaction with or without methyl p-tolyl ketone in the presence of various acids (Table 3). There was no reaction
in the case of a solution of HCl (entries 1 and 2). In addition, 3 was found in the reaction with a solution of HBr (entries
3 and 4). It is a clear contrast against the reaction with a solution
of HI (entry 16 in Table 2). Moreover, it would be caused by the strong acidity of HI.
In addition, the formation of 2a was observed in the
case of a solution of HClO4 with and without methyl p-tolyl ketone, H2SO4, and methanesulfonic
acid with methyl p-tolyl ketone. We could not give
the clear explanation of the decrease of the yield of 2a in the case of HClO4 with p-tolyl ketone.
One possible explanation is that the influence of water would be affected
in the role of ketone. As the result, the yield of 2a could not be exceeded in the combination of HI gas and methyl p-tolyl ketone.

To gain more information for the mechanistic aspect, we examined
further reactions. When 2a was treated with HI gas in
the absence of ketone, 1a was formed in 84% yield based
on α-methylstyrene unit (eq 1). This fact suggested that the reaction to form 2a was reversible. Moreover, no reaction of 1a in the presence of methyl p-tolyl ketone occurred
(eq 2). Thus, we revealed
that the formation of 1a was irreversible, and we think
that 1a would be a product under thermodynamic-controlled
conditions. To reveal a kinetic product in the reaction of α-methylstyrene
with HI, we stopped the reaction of α-methylstyrene and HI within
1 min. 2a was obtained in 37% yield as a main product
accompanied by 3 and 4, and there was no
formation of 1a. Therefore, we concluded that 2a is the kinetic product in this reaction, and that methyl p-tolyl ketone acts as an inhibitor to achieve equilibrium
conditions. 1   2   3  

From those investigations,
we proposed the reaction mechanism depicted as Scheme 2. At first, the protonation to α-methylstyrene
occurs to produce benzyl cation A. Moreover, the addition
of another α-methylstyrene forms a dimer cation B. In the case of an internal nucleophilic attack by benzene ring, 1a is obtained through intermediate C (path a).
When the counter anion I– acts as a base, dimer
olefins 3 and 4 are formed (path b and c).
Hofmann elimination proceeds to give less-substituted olefin 3 because of the bulkiness of a base (path c).14 Cation A can be reacted toward
less hindered olefin 3 to give the trimer cation D. After deprotonation with I–, 2a is obtained. When methyl p-tolyl ketone exists
in this system, the protonation with HI would be competitive with 2a and ketone. As a result, the reaction conditions with ketone
situate under kinetic control to produce 2a as a major
product. In the absence of methyl p-tolyl ketone,
the equilibrium condition is achieved to result in the thermodynamic
product 1a as major product. Complex formation with methyl p-tolyl ketone and HI would be also affected for the formation
of A. However, the protonation to bulkier olefin in 2a is more difficult than in α-methylstyrene. The kinetic
and thermodynamic products were supported by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations (see Supporting Information). The preference of the protonation between 2a and
methyl p-tolyl ketone was also supported from the
DFT calculation because the complex of methyl p-tolyl
ketone with HI was more stable with the value of 5.030 kcal/mol than
that of 2a, whose value was larger than the value in
the case of α-methylstyrene (3.846 kcal/mol) (Figure 1).

unit) and sum of the total heat of formations (hartree unit) of the

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Finally, we examined the scope
and limitation for the formation of 2 (Table 4). p-Methyl
and p-chloro-α-methylstyrene gave 2 in each 41% yield with no formation of 1 (entries 1
and 3). However, indane formation occurred when a strong electron-donating
substituent was introduced at para position, as in p-methoxy-α-methylstyrene (entry 2). Indane compound (1e) was obtained in 66% by C–C bond formation at the
naphthalene 3 position in the case of 2-(propen-2-yl)naphthalene (entry
4). Thus, the compounds with an electron-rich aromatic ring produced
indane rings. It was caused because of the electron-rich aromatics
accelerating intramolecular cyclization reaction (path a) of intermediate
cation B in Scheme 2 or that the reverse reaction to intermediate cation D from 2 could not be inhibited by the ketone
because of the large stability of D. In the case of 1-(propen-2-yl)naphthalene,
the complex mixture was obtained (entry 5). Unfortunately, the reaction of m- and o-oriented methyl-α-methylstyrenes resulted
in products with the possibility of isomers of 2 about
25 wt % amount, but the mixture was too complicated to determine the
products. The compound with aromatic rings containing heteroatom,
such as thienyl group, gave the complex mixture (entry 6). In addition,
the compound with phenyl rings on aliphatic chain of α-methylstyrene
did not undergo the reaction (entry 7). The less steric hindrance
around the cationic carbon would also necessitate the formation of
the products.

Conclusions
In
summary, we revealed the selective formation of internal olefinic
trimer (2) from α-methylstyrene by the combination
of HI gas and methyl p-tolyl ketone. The additive
ketones with the stabilization of the protonated cation by the inductive,
hyperconjugative, and mesomeric effects were efficient at producing 2 instead of indane (1). We also found that 2 is a kinetic product under these reaction conditions and
that 1 is a thermodynamic product. From those investigations,
the ketone would be affected by the inhibition to result in equilibrium
conditions by the formation of the protonated ketone. This result
would lead to a novel controlling method for polymeric and oligomeric
compounds.

for 1H NMR and with 75 or 100 MHz spectrometer for 13C NMR. Chemical shifts (δ) of 1H NMR were
expressed in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane in
CDCl3 (δ = 0) as an internal standard. Multiplicities
are indicated as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), quartet (q),
quint (quintet), m (multiplet), and coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz units. Chemical shifts (δ) of 13C NMR are expressed in parts per million relative to the
residual solvent [CDCl3 (δ = 77.0)]. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography was performed on glass plates precoated with silica
gel (0.25 mm layer thickness). Column chromatography was used on 70–230
mesh silica gel. Recycling preparative gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) was performed with YMC column (O-SIL-5-06-D 5–5, SIL
60A). Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from sodium benzophenone
ketyl immediately prior to use. Other chemical materials were used
as obtained commercially.

1,2,3-Triphenylpropene
A solution
of bromobenzene (20.35 g, 13.0 mmol) in THF (50 mL) was added to Mg
(turnings) (2.942 g, 12.1 atom) at 0 °C. The suspension was stirred
for 3 h at 65 °C until Mg was disappeared. To the solution was
dropwise added 1,3-diphenylpropan-2-one (4.204 g, 20.0 mmol), and
the mixture was stirred for 68 h at that temperature. To the reaction
mixture was added saturated aqueous NH4Cl (25 mL) and was
extracted with EtOAc (30 mL × 3). The combined organic layer
was dried with MgSO4 and was concentered. The residual
mixture was purified with column chromatography on SiO2 (CHCl3/n-hexane = 1:1) to give oil (4.273
g) included in 1,2,3-triphenylpropan-2-ol. The oil was dissolved in
toluene (40 mL). To the solution was added conc. H2SO4 (0.133 g, 1.33 mmol), and the mixture was refluxed for 1.5

Handling the Apparatus for HI Collection13
[Caution!: HI is corrosive in the case to
contact with moisture. The experiment should be conducted into fume
hood.] To pick up anhydrous HI, the stainless tube of the apparatus
was completely dehydrated in vacuo with a vacuum pump. The cycle of
fill with argon and depression in the apparatus was repeated several
times. After being filled with argon gas, the line for HI collection
was attached with a buffer pot and saturated NaOH solution pot at
the end of the line. Argon gas was flowed through the apparatus for
10 min. The control valve of argon was closed. At the same time, the
valve of HI cylinder was opened. After over 5 min of HI gas flowing,
it was picked up through rubber septum with a syringe attached with
a disposable needle. The apparatus was worked off as follows. After
the neutralization of the evolved gas under argon flow, the line for
HI collection was exchanged to the vacuum pump for 30 min. During
the reduced pressure, the stainless tube was heated with a heating
gun for drying. The apparatus was filled with argon with an application
of pressure (4–5 MPa). The depression and the filling of argon
was repeated three times to completely exclude HI gas.

General Procedure
for the Reaction of α-Methylstyrene with HI Gas in the Presence
of Methyl p-Tolyl Ketone
In a round-bottom
flask fitted with a three-way cock with septum was placed α-methylstyrene
(0.598 g, 5.0 mmol) and methyl p-tolyl ketone (36.8
mg to 0.667 g, 0.25–5.0 mmol, 0.05–1.0 equiv). The flask
was filled with nitrogen after reducing pressure. After slight decompression
to ease the gas introduction, HI gas (32.0 mg to 0.637 g, 0.25–5.0
mmol, 0.05–1.0 equiv) was brought in the vessel with a syringe
through the septum (the weight of HI gas was calculated with the change
of the weight of the equipment before and after the introduction of
HI gas). In addition, nitrogen gas was introduced into the vessel
to release deference of pressure against the atmosphere. The mixture
was stirred at 25 °C for 1 d under sealed conditions by using
a three-way cock. After reducing the pressure to release HI gas, to
the reaction mixture was added saturated Na2S2O3 (20 mL) and brine (15 mL). After being extracted with
CHCl3 (15 mL × 3), the organic layer was dried with
MgSO4. After the concentration, ca. 10.0 mg of the residue
was combined with p-chlorobenzaldehyde (ca. 10.0
mg) as an internal standard. Moreover, the mixture was measured with 1H NMR to determine the yield by the integration of methine
protons of the product and formyl peak of p-chlorobenzaldehyde
(9.98 ppm). Furthermore, the reaction mixture included in p-chlorobenzaldehyde was subject to column chromatography
on SiO2 and preparative GPC to isolate the product.

Dimeric products, 4-methyl-2,4-diphenylpent-1-1ene (3)29 and 4-methyl-2,4-diphenylpent-2-ene
(4),30 were assigned by the
corresponding proton peaks compared with the chemical shift reported
in the literature.
