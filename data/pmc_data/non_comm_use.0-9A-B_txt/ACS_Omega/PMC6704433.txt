Poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-methoxypolyethylene
glycols (PDMS-b-mPEG) were synthesized by Steglich
esterification. The high-permeable membrane (PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG) was prepared by using PDMS-b-mPEG as additives.
The successful synthesis of PDMS-b-mPEG was confirmed
by nuclear magnetic resonance. Field emission scanning electron microscopy
images show that the distribution of finger-like macroporous and sponge-like
macroporous can be modulated by controlling the ratio of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
components of additives. The distribution of additives and membrane
wettability are validated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
water contact angle test. The permeability of the blended membrane,
especially for the membrane PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 (M3),
was remarkably improved. The water permeability of M3 (239.4 L/m2·h·bar) was 6.6 times that of the unblended membrane
M0 (42.5 L/m2·h·bar). The findings of protein
BSA filtration show that the flux recovery ratio of M3 is 89.2% at
a BSA retention rate of about 80%, which demonstrates that the polysulfone
membranes blended with PDMS-b-mPEG have excellent
antifouling performance and extraordinary permeability.

1 Introduction
The
polysulfone (PSf) membrane is widely used for its excellent
chemical inertia, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and membrane
forming ability.1 PSf membranes are frequently
applied in gas separation,2 protein purification
and fractionation, osmotic evaporation, hemodialysis,3 plasma separator, cell culture, and artificial liver. Nevertheless,
the PSf membrane is vulnerable to fouling owing to its hydrophobic
nature.4 Fouling is caused by the deposition
of retained inorganic, organic, and biological substances within the
membrane pores or on the membrane surface. The fouling would reduce
the membrane flux and the service life and increase maintenance costs.
The fundamental solution to the fouling is to improve the surface
hydrophilicity.5−8 However, a large proportion of the water-soluble additives will
seep out in the water environment.

Amphiphilic additives have
hydrophobic anchoring and hydrophilic
segments; the former part would anchor with the hydrophobic membrane
matrix tightly, while the latter part can improve the wettability
of the blended membrane.9,10 The hydrophilic segments
are apt to migrate to the nonsolvent phase, thus enrich on the membrane
surface during the NIPS.11 PSf-b-PEO (polysulfone-block-polyethylene oxide)
was synthesized and blended it with PSf for ensuring the hydrophilicity.12 PEGMEMA-PSf-PEGMEMA (poly(ethylene glycol) methyl
ether methacrylate) triblocks were prepared and used as additives
to blend with PSf. The mixed PSf membranes exhibited better hydrophilicity
and protein resistance.13 Gao and co-workers
synthesized a comb-like PEG-r-PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane),
PDMS) and then mixed with PES,14 the foulants
can be readily flushed off by water currents.15,16 Xu et al. prepared the polyethersulfone-blended membrane (PES/TPQP-Cl)
with more excellent antifouling properties due to the gradient concentration
of the additive (tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)polysulfone-methylene
quaternary phosphonium chloride, TPQP-Cl), and the permeability was
improved 34 times.17

In the present
paper, we synthesized a series of hydrophobic/hydrophilic
amphiphilic block copolymer PDMS-b-mPEG with well
determined portion of hydrophilic mPEG and low surface energy PDMS
by simple and efficient Steglich esterification, and then with the
block copolymer PDMS-b-mPEG as the additives, we
prepared PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG blended membranes by NIPS
(nonsolvent induced phase separation).18 PDMS exhibits low surface energy owing to the flexible siloxane
bonds. On account of hydrogen bonding interaction, mPEG segments can
tightly hold a layer of water to prevent foulant adhesion to the membrane
surface and thus possess excellent antifouling ability.19 Therefore, hydrophobic PDMS plays an anchoring
role and avoids the leaching of PDMS-b-mPEG, and
the mPEG segment spontaneously migrates toward the membrane surface
by surface segregation to render the membrane surface hydrophilicity.2,20

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
PSf (P3500, Solvay, 22,000
Da) was bought. mPEG (weight-average molecular weight: 500, 1000,
1900, and 3000 Da), DCC (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, >99%),
DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine, >99.0%), succinic anhydride (>99%),
and BSA (bovine serum albumin) were bought (Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.,
Shanghai, China). α-Hydroxyethoxypropyl-ω-butyl terminated
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (Mw = 5 kDa; PDMS-mono-OH,
96%) was purchased from Gelest. Analytical reagent ethanol was employed
as the precipitation agent and cyclopentanone as the solvent. Dichloromethane
(DCM, AR) and cyclopentanone were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent; DCM was purified by distillation over calcium hydride.

2.2 PDMS-b-mPEG Synthesis
PDMS-b-mPEG was synthesized according to the reported
method.18 Typically, PDMS–OH (PDMS
with one end hydroxyl group, 5.00 g, 1.0 mmol, Mn 5.0 kDa), succinic anhydride (0.15 g, 1.5 mmol), DMAP (0.01
g, 0.10 mmol), and pyridine (0.12 mL, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in
anhydrous DCM (5 mL) and refluxed for 16 h. Then, the mixture was
cooled to room temperature and precipitated into hexane (50 mL). The
unreacted succinic anhydride was removed by centrifuge. The hexane
phase was washed with aqueous HCl (0.25 M, 3 × 50 mL) and H2O (3 × 50 mL), dried with NaSO4, filtered,
and finally dried in vacuo (0.1 mbar) at 30 °C to afford PDMS–COOH
as a colorless oil. As-synthesized carboxylic acid-terminated PDMS
(PDMS–COOH, 0.20 g, 0.20 mmol), mPEG (0.18 mmol; 500, 1000,
1900, and 3000 Da), DCC (0.05 g, 0.24 mmol), and DMAP (2.2 mg, 0.02
mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DCM (10 mL) and stirred at room
temperature for 48 h. The mixture was precipitated into cold diethyl
ether (50 mL), collected by centrifugation, and dried in vacuo (0.1
mbar) at 30 °C to yield PDMS-b-mPEG, a colorless
solid. The specific recipes are shown in Table 1.

2.3 PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG and PSf/PDMS/mPEG
Blended Membranes Preparation
All the membranes were prepared
by the nonsolvent induced phase separation method (NIPS), using cyclopentanone
as the solvent and ethanol as the coagulation bath. The casting solutions
of 12 wt % polymers were prepared by dissolving PSf and PDMS-b-mPEG in cyclopentanone at desired proportions (PDMS-b-mPEG percentages ranging from none to 9 wt % in the total
amount of polymers) under mechanical stirring at 70 °C for 24
h and were kept in a vacuum oven at least 48 h at 70 °C to remove
air bubbles. Then, the liquid dope was cast onto a glass plate with
a casting knife to obtain a wet film with a thickness of 200 μm,
coagulated in absolute ethanol at room temperature. The obtained PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG binary blended membrane was thoroughly washed with
ethanol to remove the residual cyclopentanone. For comparison, a set
of ternary blended PSf membranes with mPEG and PDMS as the additives
were prepared, the contents of mPEG and PDMS in the casting solutions
were equal to the contents of mPEG and PDMS segments in the casting
solutions (12 wt %) for the preparation of the binary blended membrane
with PDMS-b-mPEG. The specific compositions of membrane
casting solutions are shown in Table 2. The PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG blended membranes
are designated as M0, M1, M2, M3, and M4 (as indicated in Table 2), while the PSf/PDMS/mPEG
blended membranes are designated as S1, S2, S3, and S4.

2.4 Characterization
The chemical composition
of the synthesized polymers and the prepared membranes were characterized
with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), ATR-FTIR (attenuated total
reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and XPS (X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy). The membrane surface wettability was
examined by the water contact angle with an automatic double titrated
contact angle analyzer (Theta, Biolin Scientific Inc.). FESEM (field
emission scanning electron microscopy) observations of the surface
and cross section of the membrane were recorded. Thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA) and the mechanical strength of the polymers and membrane
samples were measured. Please see the Supporting Information for the details of the characterizations.

2.5 Filtration Experiments
Membrane permeation
and antifouling performance were then examined with ultrafiltration
of pure water and BSA solution.21 The details
of the procedure are shown in the Supporting Information.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
of PDMS-b-mPEG and Membranes
PDMS-b-mPEG containing
hydrophilic mPEG and low surface energy PDMS blocks was synthesized
by simple and efficient Steglich esterification. The hydrophilic and
hydrophobic ratios of amphiphilic diblock copolymers were controlled
by using mPEG with different chain lengths (average molecular weight:
500, 1000, 1900, and 3000 Da). PSf-b-mPEG (weight
ratios of mPEG to PSf are 9.1, 16.7, 27.5, and 37.5%) was served as
the additive. The chemical structures of the materials used in the
esterification process and the resulted diblock copolymer are shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
for PDMS-b-mPEG synthesis.

The 1H NMR spectra of these polymers (PDMS, PDMS–COOH,
and
PDMS-b-mPEG1900) are shown in Figure S1, ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
transform infrared spectra) for the samples are shown in Figure S2. These two spectra clearly confirm
the successful synthesis of these polymers.

The broad scan XPS
spectra of the membranes are shown in Figure 2. The peaks are at
285.0, 533.0, 103.8, and 171.2 eV corresponding to the binding energies
of C 1s, O 1s, Si 2p, and S 2p, respectively. The membrane surface
elemental mole percentages and O/S atomic ratio are presented in Table 3. The mole percentages
of O and S of pure PSf are 20.25 and 1.84%, respectively. In Table 3, the increase of
O and the decrease of S can be observed obviously for the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG membranes compared with the pristine PSf membrane.
This indicates that the mPEG segment exists in the membrane. The mPEG
segments segregate onto the membrane surface preferentially leading
to the increased surface O/S ratio.2 The
XPS peak of 103.8 eV (Si 2p) suggests the PDMS block on the surfaces
be resulted from segregation.18 In other
words, it is confirmed that the additive PDMS-b-mPEG
migrated toward the membrane surface in the membrane preparation process;22 moreover, the additive content of the upper
surface is higher than that of the lower surface. In order to further
determine the chemical contents quantitatively, the C 1s core level
spectrum is resolved into multipeaks and shown in Figure 3: the binding energy positions
of C–C at 285.0 eV, C–Si at 284.2 eV, and C–O
at 286.0 eV.14,22

The surface and the cross section morphologies of
the membrane
are displayed in Figure 4. It can be observed that the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG membrane
pore structure after adding additives shows a typical asymmetric structure.
The asymmetric membrane appears a skin layer of finger-like pores
and a bottom layer of spongy pores.

Figure 4 FESEM observations of the upper surface,
cross section, and lower
surface of the membranes PSf (M0), PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG
(M1–M4) and PSf/PDMS/mPEG1900 (S3).

With the additive added, the pore size and porosity of the
top
surface increase but not as obvious as the bottom surface. Meanwhile,
the proportion of finger-like pores increases, while the spongy pores
decrease. The pristine membranes are almost spongy pores due to the
strong chain activity and sufficient adjustment time during the phase
inversion process. The addition of the additive PDMS-b-mPEG (equivalent to surfactant) impedes the interaction between
solvents and nonsolvents, which means that the adjustment time of
the chain, is shortened. Hence, the addition of the additive leads
the finger-like pores and macrovoids to increase. With the increase
of molecular weight of PDMS-b-mPEG in the casting
solution, there is a trend from delayed demixing to instantaneous
demixing.23,24 From Figure 5C, it can be observed that this membrane is almost
finger-like and the pore size is larger. This is mainly due to the
mPEG chain migrating into the coagulation bath in the membrane-making
process.

Figure 5 Cross-sectional FESEM image of the polysulfone membrane in different
(a, b) solvent–nonsolvent systems and (c) blended membrane
M3.

Solvent plays a critical role
in the membrane morphology formation,
by using different solvents, the finger-like and spongy membrane pores
could be obtained. For comparison, NMP (a usually used solvent, which
could only dissolve pure PSf but could not dissolve PDMS nor PDMS-b-mPEG) and cyclopentanone (could dissolve both PSf and
PDMS) were applied in the work to dissolve PSf and the diblock PDMS-b-mPEG. It could be clearly found from Figure 5 that the membranes with totally
different morphologies have been obtained, which might pose an important
impact on the membrane performances.

For further confirmation,
the membrane pore size (average diameter,
measured at intervals of 2° and through the center of mass of
the object) and surface porosity (hole ratio, the ratio between the
hole area and the total area of the object) are calculated by Image-Pro
Plus (Figure S3, Image-Pro Plus automatically
generate the red mark when calculating the pore size and surface porosity). Table 4 shows that the average
pore size of the membrane surface is smaller on the upper surface
than that on the lower surface, and the mean membrane pore size becomes
larger at both of the upper and lower surfaces with PDMS-b-mPEG addition. This result is very consistent with the observations
of the FESEM image (Figure 4).

Figure 6 shows that
the water contact angle increases for the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG membrane with low-molecular part of mPEG due to PDMS segments
segregated on the surface.25 With mPEG
molecular weight increasing, that is, the proportion of PDMS component
decreases or the mPEG component increases, and the static contact
angle gradually decreases. The water contact angles of M1–M3
decrease gradually, while that of M4 increases. The significant hydrophilicity
improvement is attributed to the migration of mPEG fragments to the
membrane surface.26 The decreased hydrophilic
property of the membrane M4 is owing to the high molecular weight
of mPEG in the additive PDMS-b-mPEG3000 with low
water solubility or water affinity, which leads the migration ability
of the additive to weaken during the phase inversion process.27,28

The thermal degradation of pure PSf, PDMS-b-mPEG1900,
PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG500, PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1000,
PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900, and PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG3000 was performed up to 800 °C at 10 °C/min under
an argon flow rate as presented in Figure 7. It could be found that the pure PSf is
the most stable, its degradation starts at about 500 °C. While
the diblock copolymer of PDMS-b-mPEG1900 is the most
unstable, the major weight loss of approximately 40% was observed
around 400 °C, which may be attributed to the disintegration
of the mPEG chains attached to PDMS.29 For
the blended membranes of PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG500, PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1000, PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900, and PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG3000, the thermal stability is obviously improved.
These results show that the prepared blended PSf membranes are thermally
stable.

Mechanical properties of the PSf
membrane and PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 blended membrane
are shown in Figure 8. It could be found that the
tensile strength and the elongation rate at break of the PSf membrane
are 17.16 MPa and 12.5%, respectively, while they are 23.3 MPa and
13.7% for the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 blended membrane,
respectively. These obtained results reveal that the mechanical properties
are improved with the blending of PDMS-b-mPEG1900
with PSf, indicating that the blended membranes are mechanically stable.

3.2 Membrane
Filtration Performance
The
BSA retention rate and the pure water flux for M0 and M1–M4
are exhibited in Figure 9, which shows that the flux dramatically rises with the molecular
weight of mPEG component in the additive PDMS-b-mPEG
up to 1900 Da and then it decreases with further raising the molecular
weight to 3000 Da. The flux ascends from 42.5 LMH through the pure
PSf membrane to roughly 239.4 LMH through the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 membrane and then falls to about 115.7 LMH through the
PDMS-b-mPEG3000 membrane. The PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 membrane shows the highest water flux. The retention rate
to BSA of these membranes remains stable and high at 82% regardless
of the molecular weight of mPEG in the additive PDMS-b-mPEG.

Figure 9 Pure water flux and BSA retention rate of the pure PSf membrane
M0 and the blended membranes M1–M4.

For the sake of comparison, as shown in Figure 10, water permeability is determined
(the
slope of the linear fitting curve of each membrane flux with transmembrane
pressure). The permeability of the 12 wt % PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 94/6 membrane was 142.5 LMH/bar, almost three times than
that of the 12 wt % PSf pure membrane (47.9 LMH/bar).

Figure 10 Pure water flux of M0
and M1–M4 vs transmembrane pressure.

The permeability and protein retention rate have a synergistic
effect on the hydrophilicity and pore microstructure. The corresponding
microstructure is shown in Figures 4 and 5. Previous work has demonstrated
that membrane fouling with larger pore sizes is more serious than
the membrane with smaller pore sizes, and the fouling of the macroporous
membrane is mainly caused by pore blockage.30 The pore size of the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG membrane is
larger than that of the pure PSf membrane M0. Nevertheless, PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG membranes display an improved antifouling property.
The results show that the PDMS-b-mPEG segregation
on the surfaces of the membrane skin and the inner pore wall can effectively
prevent fouling. It is reported that a variety of additives have been
used to modify polysulfone membranes. The performances of our blended
membrane PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 are compared with those
of published works (Table 5).

The pure water flux (J0), BSA flux
(Jp) at the steady state, and pure water
flux after cleaning (J1) are recorded
and shown in Figure 11.34 After cleaning, the flux of the M0
membrane decreased seriously, and the flux recovery ratio (FRR) is
low (30.2%, Figure 12), with poor antifouling performance. For membranes M1–M4,
FRR values are much higher than M0. The M3 FRR is up to 89.2%. The
high FRR value means that the membrane has higher hydraulic cleaning
efficiency and better antifouling performance. This indicates that
M3 has the best antifouling performance.To better understand the effect of PDMS-b-mPEG on microstructure and permeable property, PSf membranes with
mPEG and PDMS homopolymers as blend components were prepared. The
PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG binary blended membrane and the PSf/PDMS/mPEG
ternary blended membrane, with the same content of mPEG chains, were
prepared. The morphology and permeability of PSf/PDMS/mPEG membranes
were studied, as shown in Figures 4 and 13. It can be observed
that this membrane is almost finger-like and the pore size is very
large. It is mainly due to the mPEG homopolymer that easily leaching
out toward the coagulation bath in the membrane-preparing process.
As is found from Figure 13, the water flux of the membrane remains basically unchanged,
indicating that mPEG homopolymers may leach out into the coagulation
bath. On the other hand, PDMS-b-mPEG would be stagnated
in the membrane matrix due to its insolubility in ethanol.2

blended membrane with
various molecular weights of mPEG (S1/mPEG500; S2/mPEG1000; S3/mPEG1900;
S4/mPEG3000).

The top membrane surface
is more hydrophilic (as shown in Figure 6) with smaller pore
size than that of the bottom membrane surface (as shown in Figure 4, Figure S3, and Table 4). As a consequence, the membrane performances, including
pure water flux and antifouling characterizations were tested with
the top membrane surface toward the feed solution. On the other hand,
the pore sizes of the top surface for the blended membranes are larger
than those of the top surface for the pure PSf membranes, but it changes
very little. As a result, the blended membranes display good antifouling
property than that of the pure PSf membrane, though the blended membranes
have larger top membrane pore sizes due to the above reasons.

4 Conclusions
The amphiphilic diblock copolymer PDMS-b-mPEG
was prepared by the Steglich esterification method. The copolymers
as additives were incorporated with polysulfone to fabricate blended
membranes (PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG) through the nonsolvent
induced phase separation technique. To better prepare the PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG blended membrane, cyclopentanone was used as the
solvent and ethanol as the coagulant.

FTIR, XPS analysis, and
water contact angle measurement showed
that PDMS-b-mPEG was segregated to the membrane surface.
By taking advantages of mPEG hydrophilicity and PDMS low surface energy,
the blended membrane has excellent antifouling performance and extraordinary
water permeability. The pore size and porosity on the upper membrane
surface increased with the additive adding but not as obvious as the
ones on the lower surface. Meanwhile, the proportion of finger-like
pores becomes large, and that of spongy pores becomes small, which
was characterized by FESEM observation. The PSf/PDMS-b-mPEG1900 blended membrane exhibits the highest permeability of 142.5
LMH/bar. The flux recovery ratio of M3 significantly enhanced to a
high value of 89.2%, indicating that the blended membranes has a good
long-term application prospect.
