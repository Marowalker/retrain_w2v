A series of neutral and cationic
palladium(II) complexes containing C2-symmetric
bis(oxazoline) (BOX) ligands, (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d), (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3a–d), and [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d) [BOX: 2,2′-(2-propylidene)bis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}, 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}, 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4,5,5-triphenyl-2-oxazoline}, and 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R,5S)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazoline}], were
prepared, and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.
It was found that substituents at the 5-position (Ph, Me) in addition
to substituents on the bridgehead carbon directly affect the structure
around palladium, especially the BOX bite angle and the dihedral angles
between the phenyl rings at the 4-position and the N2Pd
plane. Treatment of the bridged methylene proton in the BOX ligand
(1b–d) with KH afforded the anionic
BOX ligand; also, the neutral Pd complexes, (BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N) (5b–d), could thus be prepared by reaction with Pd(Me)Cl(cod) (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene); 5b–d showed strong coordination to Pd,
as demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic analysis.

Introduction
Carbon–carbon
bond formation is one of the most important
reactions in synthetic chemistry; transition metal–alkyl complexes
play roles as reagents or intermediates in stoichiometric/catalytic
organic reactions and olefin polymerization.1−6 The synthesis and reaction chemistry of the metal alkyls are thus
important in the design of efficient catalysts as well as to better
understand the reaction mechanisms. Palladium complexes are widely
used as catalysts in efficient carbon–carbon bond formation
reactions, such as coupling reactions and olefin oligomerization/polymerization.7−16 In particular, palladium complexes containing α-diimine ligands17−24 and phosphine–sulfonate ligands25−30 are known to be effective catalysts for ethylene copolymerization,
not only with α-olefin, but also with olefins containing polar
functional groups.31−33

The synthesis and reaction chemistry of transition
metal complexes
containing optically active C2-symmetric
ligands are an important subject for the design of asymmetric catalytic
reactions. Zirconocene complexes containing C2-symmetric ligands, exemplified as [Me2Si(indenyl)2]ZrCl2,34,35 and nickel complexes
containing C2-symmetric α-diimine
ligands36−38 have been used as the catalysts for the isospecific
polymerization of α-olefins. Chiral bis(oxazoline) (BOX, 1) has also been employed as a highly attractive neutral C2-symmetric bidentate ligand in various transition
metal catalysts (such as Cu, Pd, Ni, Zn, Fe, Rh, Mg, Li, Mn, and Co);39−41 various palladium-catalyzed organic transformations are also known.42−64 However, in contrast to their wide applications in organic transformations,
the synthesis and structural analyses of a series of metal complexes
with different ligand substituents have not yet been explored in detail.
Such a study would provide important information for the design of
efficient catalysts and also increase understanding of catalysis.
Some studies have been published concerning the effects of modifications
(such as Ph, t-Bu, benzyl, or naphthyl) at the 4-position
of BOX ligands, adjacent to the metal center, on the selectivity/activity
of catalytic reactions.39−41 In contrast, we herein focus
on modification at the 5-position because we assumed at an early stage
that modification at this position should also play a role in asymmetric
induction (the structure around the metal center) and thus in the
reactivity, probably on the basis of the stabilities of the catalytic
intermediates. In fact, the introduction of substituents (methyl and
phenyl groups) at the 5-position in BOX affects its reactivity in
nickel-catalyzed ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization.65,66 However, reports concerning the effects of the substituents on the
basis of structural analysis (isolated complexes) remain limited.

Therefore, in this article, we have explored the synthesis and
structural analysis of a series of neutral and cationic palladium(II)
complexes containing BOX ligands (shown in Chart 1), (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d), (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3a–d), and [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d) [BOX: 2,2′-(2-propylidene)bis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}, 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}, 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4,5,5-triphenyl-2-oxazoline}, and 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R,5S)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazoline}]. Moreover,
we have prepared a series of novel neutral (BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N) (5b–d) (Chart 1) by deprotonation
of the bridgehead methylene protons using KH. Through this research,
we sought to obtain basic information concerning the effects of ligands
on their structures (coordination modes and electronic states) for
better understanding the performance of catalysts.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Molecular Structure of C2-Symmetric BOX Ligands (1a–d)
We focused on C2-symmmetric
BOX ligands
containing methyl or phenyl substituents at the 5-position in the
oxazoline ring and at the bridgehead carbon between two oxazolines
to explore their influences on the structures of a series of BOX–palladium(II)
complexes. Because optically active amino alcohol derivatives (6) bearing substituents (R1) can be synthesized
by the reaction of amino ester hydrochloride salt with Grignard reagents
(Scheme 1), various
substituents (R1) can be thus introduced in BOX ligands
using these amino alcohols as a starting material. First, optically
active amino alcohols, (R)-1-amino-2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-ol
(6a) and (R)-2-amino-1,1,2-triphenylethanol
(6c), were prepared using modifications of reported procedures
(Scheme 1).67,68 The reaction of chiral amino alcohol 6a with oxalyl
chloride in the presence of triethylamine afforded N1,N3-bis((R)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropyl)-2,2-dimethylmalonamide (7a); then, intramolecular dehydration condensation of 7a using Ti(OiPr)4 as
a catalyst afforded 2,2′-(2-propylidene)bis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline} (1a). One-pot syntheses
were conducted for 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}
(1b) and 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4,5,5-triphenyl-2-oxazoline} (1c). Condensation of
amino alcohol 6a or 6c with dimethylmalonate
afforded the corresponding bisamide alcohol (7b or 7c) in situ; then, the addition of Ti(OiPr)4 afforded BOX (1b or 1c) in good overall yields. Furthermore, the detailed structures of
BOX (1b, 1c) and commercially available
BOX (1d) were confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1). There were no
significant differences in the bond lengths or angles, as shown in Table 1.

Synthesis and
Characterization of Neutral (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d)
Reactions of BOX (1a–d) with equimolar amounts of PdCl2(CH3CN)2 in CH2Cl2 at
room temperature (25 °C) afforded the corresponding dichloro
complexes, (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d), in high yields (92–94%, Scheme 2); these were identified by NMR spectra and
elemental analyses (shown in the Experimental Section). The structures of 2a–d were also
determined by X-ray crystallography (shown below).69

Scheme 2 Synthesis of (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d)
Figure 2 shows ORTEP
drawings of complexes 2a–d; their
selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Table 2. These complexes fold around
palladium in a square planar geometry consisting of two chlorine ligands
and two nitrogen atoms in the BOX ligand. The total bond angles around
palladium are close to 360° [sums of the bond angles of N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2),
Cl(1)–Pd(1)–Cl(2), N(1)–Pd(1)–Cl(2), and
N(2)–Pd(1)–Cl(1): 2a: 360.03°, 2b: 360.07°, 2c: 360.46°, 2d: 359.95°], suggesting that palladium, two chlorine ligands,
and two nitrogen atoms exist almost on the same plane [mean deviations
from the plane in 2a: 0.0193 Å, 2b:
0.0292 Å, 2c: 0.0000 Å, 2d: 0.0228
Å]. It was found that the bridge angles of C(2)–C(1)–C(5)
in 2b–d [2b: 114.3(3)°, 2c: 115.9(4)°, 2d: 115.3(3)°] are larger
than those in 1b–d [1b: 111.24(14)°, 1c: 110.69(16)°, 1d: 109.4(3)°]. These angles are influenced by the coordination
of the BOX ligand to palladium, whereas no significant differences
in the bond lengths between (BOX)PdCl2 (2b–d) and BOX (1b–d) were observed (as shown in Tables 1 and 2). It is noteworthy that
complex 2a [87.17(16)°] has a smaller coordination
angle in the BOX ligand than that of complexes 2b–d [88.88(11)–88.98(13)°], whereas
no significant differences in the angles were observed in 2b–d. The bridge angle of C(2)–C(1)–C(5)
in 2a [110.1(4)°] is also smaller than that in 2b–d [114.3(3)–115.9(4)°],
probably because of the geminal dimethyl groups at the bridgehead
carbon C(1) in the BOX ligand. These data suggest that the substituents
at the bridgehead carbon (not at the 5-position) control the BOX coordination
angle, which should influence both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity.70−72

The
geometry of the substituent at the 4-position in the oxazoline
ring should affect the selectivity and reactivity of BOX-metal catalysts
because the substituents influence the size of the coordination site
on the metal (Figure 3). In fact, the dihedral angle (the mean value of the Ph1–N2PdCl2 and Ph2–N2PdCl2 dihedral angles, Table 2) in 2a–d decreases in the following order: 2a (98.362°) > 2b (93.707°) > 2d (90.667°) > 2c (89.910°). The distance
between
Pd and the para-carbon (p-C) of
the phenyl groups at the 4-position (mean value of Pd–p-C in the Ph1 and Ph2 distances, Table 2) also decreases in
the following order: 2a (6.057 Å) > 2b (6.017 Å) > 2d (5.886 Å) > 2c (5.773 Å). These results highly suggest that steric bulk in
the substituents at the 5-position decreases the dihedral angles as
well as the Pd–p-C distances, whereas the
geminal dimethyl groups at the bridgehead carbon increase these angles
and distances (Figure 3). Consequently, the reactivities and selectivities of catalytic
reactions should be attributed to the introduction of substituents,
especially at the 5-position, in BOX. In fact, the enhanced reactivities
and/or selectivities have been reported for several reactions using
(BOX)metal catalysts (palladium: allylic alkylation48 and hydroarylation;57 nickel:
polymerization65,66 and conjugate addition;73 copper: cyclopropanation74−76 and dearomatization;77 and lanthanide: hydroamination/cyclization).78

Synthesis and Characterization
of Neutral (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3a–d)
Reaction of 1a–d with Pd(Me)Cl(cod)
(cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene)
in CH2Cl2 at room temperature afforded (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl
(3a–d) in high yields (86–95%, Scheme 3); these were identified
by NMR spectra and elemental analysis (shown in the Experimental Section). The 1H NMR spectrum of each
complex shows resonance of the corresponding protons of the methyl
group bound to palladium in a high magnetic field (3a: 0.07 ppm, 3b: 0.10 ppm, 3c: 0.25 ppm, 3d: 0.22 ppm in CD2Cl2 at 25 °C).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3a–d)
Single crystals of (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl
(3a, 3c) were grown by slow diffusion of n-hexane into
dichloromethane solution, and the structures were confirmed by X-ray
crystallography (Figure 4, Table 3). In crystallographic
analyses of 3a,c, the R1 and wR2 values are a little higher than those
of complexes 2a–d due to the disordered
Me and Cl groups bonding to Pd (3a: R1 = 0.0550, wR2 = 0.1442; 3c: R1 = 0.0493, wR2 = 0.1229; 2a–d: R1 = 0.0238–0.0279,
wR2 = 0.0571–0.0731). Similar to complexes 2a–d, complexes 3a and 3c fold around palladium in a square planar geometry consisting
of two nitrogen atoms in the BOX ligand and chlorine and methyl ligands.
The total bond angles around palladium are close to 360° (sums
of the bond angles of N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2), Cl(1)–Pd(1)–C(1),
N(1)–Pd(1)–Cl(1), and N(2)–Pd(1)–C(1): 3a: 360.1° and 3c: 360.0°), suggesting
that the methyl group attached to palladium exists on the plane consisting
of palladium, chlorine, and two nitrogen atoms (mean deviations from
the plane in 3a, 0.0211 Å and in 3c, 0.0289 Å). The bond lengths of Pd(1)–C(1) [3a, 3c: 2.13(2) and 2.018(9) Å, respectively] are
shorter than those of Pd(1)–Cl(1) [3a, 3c: 2.236(5) and 2.301(2) Å, respectively]. Moreover, the C(3)–C(2)–C(6)
and N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2) bond angles in 3a [108.6(9)
and 86.9(4)°, respectively] are smaller than those in 3c [108.6(9) and 86.9(4)°, respectively], as observed in 2a–d (Table 2). The dihedral angle in 3c is
smaller than that in 3a, probably influenced by the steric
bulk of the substituents at the 5-position (Ph1–N2PdCCl
and Ph2–N2PdCCl: 3a, 89.308 and 91.958°,
respectively; 3c, 82.621 and 81.874°, respectively).

Synthesis and Characterization of Cationic [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d)
The corresponding
cationic [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d) could be prepared by treating 3a–d, prepared in situ according to the procedure described above,
with AgPF6 and 2,6-lutidine (Scheme 4). The resulting complexes (4a–d) were identified by NMR spectroscopy and elemental
analysis; the structure of complex 4a was determined
by X-ray crystallography (Figure 5, Table 3). In the 13C NMR spectra, resonances ascribed to the
methyl groups bound to palladium appear at lower magnetic fields than
those of the corresponding neutral (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3)
(4a: −4.16 ppm, 4b: −3.65
ppm, 4c: −3.72 ppm, 4d: −3.07
ppm, 3a: −5.85 ppm, 3b: −5.30
ppm, 3c: −5.12 ppm, 3d: −4.26
ppm in CD2Cl2 at 25 °C). These spectral
data suggest low electron density at the palladium center in complex 4.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d)
In complex 4a,
a square planar geometry is folded
around palladium, consisting of three nitrogen
atoms in the BOX ligand and 2,6-lutidine and a methyl ligand (sum
of the bond angles of N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2), N(3)–Pd(1)–C(26),
N(1)–Pd(1)–N(3), and N(2)–Pd(1)–C(26)
in 4a: 359.92°; mean deviation from the plane in 4a: 0.0339 Å). Pd(1)–N(3) [2.043(3) Å] is
relatively short, which implies that the 2,6-lutidine ligand strongly
coordinates to Pd. The dihedral angle of Ph1–N2PdCN
close to the less bulky methyl ligand is much smaller than that of
Ph2–N2PdCN close to the bulky 2,6-lutidine (Ph1–N2PdCN: 77.612°, Ph2–N2PdCN:
90.714°).

Synthesis and Characterization of Neutral
(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N) (5b–d)
Interestingly, it was found that
a treatment of
the BOX ligands (1b–d) with KH in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) afforded the potassium salts of the anionic
BOX ligands (1b–d-K) by abstraction
of the hydrogen attached to the bridgehead carbon (Scheme 5). Pd(Me)Cl(cod) was then treated
with the obtained K-salt (1b–d-K)
in the presence of 2,6-lutidine to afford novel neutral palladium
complexes with anionic BOX ligands (5b–d); these complexes were identified by NMR spectroscopy and elemental
analysis. In the 13C NMR spectra, resonances ascribed to
the methyl groups bound to palladium in 5a–d appear at higher magnetic fields than those in the corresponding
cationic [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4) and neutral
(BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3) (5b: −5.74 ppm, 5c: −5.93 ppm, 5d: −5.67 ppm in
C6D6 at 25 °C, 4b: −3.65
ppm, 4c: −3.72 ppm, 4d: −3.07
ppm in CD2Cl2 at 25 °C, 3b: −5.30 ppm, 3c: −5.12 ppm, 3d: −4.26 ppm in CD2Cl2 at 25 °C).
Moreover, the methylene proton signal of 5c (−0.39
ppm) in the 1H NMR spectrum (in CDCl3 at 25
°C) is observed in a higher magnetic field than that of complexes 4c and 3c (0.17 and 0.25 ppm, respectively).
These spectral properties of complex 5 compared to those
of the other complexes (3, 4) suggest that
the palladium in 5 possesses higher electron density
because of electron donation from the anionic BOX ligand.

Scheme 5 Synthesis
of (BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N) (5b–d)
Single crystals of 5b suitable for X-ray
crystallography
were grown by slow diffusion of Et2O into dichloromethane
solution. The ORTEP drawing is shown in Figure 6, and the selected bond distances and angles
are summarized in Table 3 (together with 3a, 3c, and 4a for comparison). Complex 5b also folds in a distorted
square planar geometry around palladium with BOX, 2,6-lutidine, and
methyl ligands (sum of the bond angles of N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2),
N(3)–Pd(1)–C(24), N(1)–Pd(1)–N(3), and
N(2)–Pd(1)–C(24): 360.02°; mean deviation from
the plane: 0.0250 Å). The bond lengths of C(1)–C(2), C(1)–C(5),
N(1)–C(2), and N(2)–C(5) are between those of single
and double bonds [C(1)–C(2): 1.402(5) Å, C(1)–C(5):
1.392(5) Å, N(1)–C(2): 1.316(5) Å, N(2)–C(5):
1.316(5) Å] in contrast to those in BOX (1) and
complexes 2–4 [C(1)–C(2) or
C(2)–C(3): 1.481(5)–1.519(7) Å, C(1)–C(5)
or C(2)–C(6): 1.488(5)–1.522(6) Å, N(1)–C(2)
or N(1)–C(3): 1.270(7)–1.292(14) Å, N(2)–C(5)
or N(2)–C(6): 1.265(7)–1.297(14) Å] (Tables 1–3). This structural feature suggests a resonance hybrid of the two
local structures, A and B, in complex 5b (Figure 6). The high planarity of the plane consisting of Pd(1), C(1), C(2),
C(5), N(1), and N(2) (mean deviation from the plane: 0.0208 Å)
also indicates a resonance hybrid structure. The Pd–N bond
lengths are shorter than those in the corresponding methyl palladium
complexes 3 and 4, indicating strong coordination
of the BOX ligand to the metal in 5 [Pd(1)–N(1),
Pd(1)–N(2) in 5b: 2.108(3) and 2.036(3) Å, 3a: 2.110(9) and 2.090(10) Å, 3c: 2.114(4)
and 2.070(4) Å, 4a: 2.134(3) and 2.060(3) Å,
respectively]. The large C(2)−C(1)−C(5) bond angle in 5b [122.5(3)°] is derived from the sp2 hybridization
of the bridgehead carbon. In turn, the large bite angle of N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2)
[90.06(12)°] is derived from the large bridge angle of C(2)−C(1)−C(5)
[122.5(3)°]. The dihedral angle of Ph1–N2PdCN
is much smaller than that of Ph2–N2PdCN, similar
to that in complex 4a (Ph1–N2PdCN,
Ph2–N2PdCN in 5b: 82.004 and 96.131°, 4a: 77.612 and 90.714°, respectively). However, the dihedral
angles in 5b are larger than those in complex 4a because of strong coordination of the BOX ligand to Pd in 5b [Pd(1)–N(1), Pd(1)–N(2) in 5b: 2.108(3), 2.036(3) Å, 4a: 2.134(3), 2.060(3)
Å, respectively]. Azabis(oxazoline) ligands with electron-donating
amino groups in the central bridge are also known to coordinate strongly
to metals, resulting in greatly improved stability of the metal complexes;79,80 this results in higher reactivity, selectivity, and reusability
not only for homogeneous catalytic reactions but also for heterogeneous
reactions.41,79−83 Both the spectral and structural features of complex 5 suggest higher stability as well as higher electron density
at the palladium center derived from the anionic BOX ligand, similar
to that in azabis(oxazoline) metal complexes. Thus, a series of complexes 5 are expected to be applied as new catalytic intermediates,
in contrast to complexes 2–4.

Conclusions
As
summarized in Chart 2, a series of neutral palladium complexes containing C2-symmetric BOX ligands, (BOX)PdCl2 (2a–d) and (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl (3a–d), have been synthesized by reacting
PdCl2(CH3CN)2 or Pd(Me)Cl(cod) with
BOX ligands (1a–d) [2,2′-(2-propylidene)bis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline} (1a),
2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline}
(1b), 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R)-4,5,5-triphenyl-2-oxazoline}
(1c), and 2,2′-methylenebis{(4R,5S)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazoline} (1d)];
the cationic methyl complexes, [(BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N)]+PF6– (4a–d), have been synthesized by
in situ preparation of 3a–d, followed
by addition of AgPF6. Moreover, novel neutral palladium–methyl
complexes containing anionic ligands (5b–d) have also been prepared by treatment of Pd(Me)Cl(cod) with
the ligand potassium salt prepared by hydrogen abstraction of the
methylene bridgehead. The X-ray crystal structures reveal that all
complexes fold in a distorted square planar geometry around Pd; steric
bulk in the substituents at the 5-position in the BOX ligand decreases
the dihedral angles between the Ph ring at the 4-position and the
N2Pd plane. The bite angle in 2a (with geminal dimethyl
groups at the bridgehead carbon in the BOX ligand) is smaller than
that in 2b–d (with no substituents
at the bridgehead carbon). Cationic [(BOX)PdMe(NC6H3Me2)]+PF6– (4) reveals lower electron density at the palladium
center compared to that in the corresponding neutral (BOX)Pd(Me)Cl
(3); this was supported by the 13C NMR spectra.
Neutral (BOX)PdMe(2,6-Me2C5H3N) (5) also demonstrates higher electron density because of electron
donation from the anionic BOX ligand. The high planarity of the plane
constructed with Pd(1), C(1), C(2), C(5), N(1), and N(2), the large
bridge and bite angles of C(2)−C(1)−C(5) and N(1)–Pd(1)–N(2),
and the shorter Pd–N bond lengths indicate a resonance hybrid
structure in the BOX ligand. These electronic and steric features
are different from those of complexes 2–4; however, they are similar to those of azabis(oxazoline)
metal complexes. Because these palladium complexes are highly promising
as precatalysts for efficient organic transformations (C–C
bond formation, etc.), the information introduced here may be important
for the design of more efficient catalysts and may also increase the
general understanding of catalysis.

(6a)
Methylmagnesium bromide (3.0 M in diethyl
ether, 100 mL, 0.300 mol) was added slowly to a suspension of (R)-methyl 2-amino-2-phenylacetate hydrochloride (12.2 g,
60.5 mmol) in diethyl ether (200 mL) at −40 °C. After
addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at −40 °C for
1 h and then allowed to reach at room temperature with vigorous stirring
overnight. Saturated aqueous NH4Cl was added dropwise at
0 °C until the precipitate was dissolved. The aqueous phase was
separated from the organic phase and extracted with ethyl acetate
(3 × 150 mL). The combined organic extract was washed with water
(2 × 100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. The
organic solution was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure
to give yellow oil. Recrystallization of the oil from AcOEt–n-hexane gave a pale yellow solid (9.2 g, 92%). 1H NMR (500.1 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.34–7.28 (m,
5H, Ph), 3.81 (s, 1H, CH), 2.02 (brs, 2H, NH, OH), 1.22 (s, 3H, CH3), 1.00 (s, 3H, CH3). The spectral data were identical

hydrochloride (6.0 g, 30.0 mmol) was added in small portions to methylmagnesium
bromide solution in diethyl ether (3.0 M, 100 mL, 0.300 mol) at 0
°C for 30 min. After addition, the reaction mixture was stirred
at 0 °C for 30 min and then allowed to reach room temperature
with vigorous stirring overnight. The reaction mixture was poured
slowly into the iced water (120 mL), and concentrated HCl (45 mL)
was added dropwise. After stirring for 1 h, the generated precipitate
was collected by filtration and the remaining yellow solid was washed
with water three times. The solid was dissolved in aqueous NaOH (2.0
M, 110 mL); then, the solution was stirred for 30 min. The aqueous
phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 150 mL), and the
combined organic extract was washed with brine (100 mL) and dried
over Na2SO4. The organic solution was filtered
and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. Recrystallization
of the oil from CH2Cl2–n-hexane gave a pale yellow solid (7.7 g, 89%). 1H NMR

CH2Cl2 (anhydrous, 13 mL) was cooled to −10
°C. 2,2-Dimethylmalonyl chloride (0.65 g, 3.77 mmol) was then
added dropwise over 3 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm
to 20 °C and stirred for 6 h. Subsequently, aqueous HCl (1 N,
15 mL) was added in one portion. The organic phase was separated,
washed with aqueous NaHCO3 (5%, 20 mL), washed with H2O (5 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated
under reduced pressure to give a white solid 7a, which
was used in the next step without further purification (1.64 g, quant). 1H NMR (270.1 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ

7a (0.859 g, 2.01 mmol) and xylene (anhydrous, 50
mL) were
charged into a 2-necked flask equipped with a Dean–Stark apparatus;
then, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux to dissolve the bisamide
alcohol completely. Ti(OiPr)4 (57.1 mg, 0.201 mmol) was then added to the solution in one portion.
The reaction mixture was refluxed for 48 h with removal of the water
byproduct. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting
pale yellow oil was purified by column chromatography (neutral almina,
hexane/AcOEt = 10:1 to 2:1) to give a white solid 1a (0.579

Synthesis of 2,2′-Methylenebis[(4R)-4-phenyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-oxazoline]
(1b)
Dimethylmalonate (0.245 g, 1.86 mmol),
amino alcohol 6a (0.652 g, 3.95 mmol), and xylene (anhydrous,
60 mL) were charged into a 2-necked flask equipped with a Dean–Stark
apparatus; then, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 13
h. After cooling the reaction mixture at room temperature, Ti(OiPr)4 (113 mg, 0.398 mmol) was
then added to the solution in one portion. The reaction mixture was
refluxed for 43 h with removal of the water byproduct. After the reaction,
the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting
red-yellow oil was purified by column chromatography (neutral alumina,
hexane/AcOEt = 9:1 to 1:1) to give pale yellow oil. Recrystallization
from dichloromethane and hexane gave a white solid 1b (0.414 g, 61% yield 2 step based on dimethylmalonate). Single crystals
suitable for X-ray crystallography were grown by slow diffusion of
hexane into dichloromethane solution. 1H NMR (500.1 MHz,

2H, CH), 3.53 (s, 2H, CH2), 1.60 (s, 6H, CH3), 0.88 (s, 6H, CH3). 13C NMR (125.8 MHz, CDCl3): δ 162.21 (N=C), 138.69 (i-Ph), 128.12 (Ph), 127.43 (Ph), 127.20 (Ph), 88.06 (qC), 78.14 (CH),

Synthesis of 2,2′-Methylenebis[(4R)-4,5,5-triphenyl-2-oxazoline]
(1c)
The synthetic procedure for 1c is similar to that for 1b, except that dimethylmalonate
(0.315 g, 2.38 mmol), amino alcohol 6c (1.38 g, 4.77
mmol) in place of 6a, xylene (anhydrous, 50 mL), and
Ti(OiPr)4 (68.0 mg, 0.239 mmol)
were used. Recrystallization from dichloromethane and hexane gave
a white solid 1c (0.945 g, 68% yield 2 step based on
dimethylmalonate). Single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography
were grown by slow diffusion of hexane into dichloromethane solution. 1H NMR (500.1 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.68 (d, J = 7.25 Hz, 4H, o-Ph), 7.40 (dd, J = 7.25, 6.95 Hz, 4H, m-Ph), 7.34 (t, J = 6.95 Hz, 2H, p-Ph), 7.12–7.10

Synthesis of (BOX)PdCl2 (2a)
PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (40.1 mg, 0.155 mmol)
and BOX (1a) (64.8 mg, 0.166 mmol) were dissolved with
2 mL of anhydrous CH2Cl2 at room temperature
in a glove box; then, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 19 h. The mixture was filtered through a pad of celite, and the
filtrate was concentrated to 0.5 mL. n-Hexane (ca.
10 mL) was added dropwise to the concentrated solution with stirring.
The resultant orange solid was collected by filtration and washed
with n-hexane three times. The solid was dried in
vacuo to afford an orange powder 2a (81.8 mg, 93%). Single

Synthesis of (BOX)PdCl2 (2c)
Synthesis
of 2c was conducted by a similar procedure
as that for 2a, except that BOX 1c (101.2
mg, 0.166 mmol) was used in place of BOX 1a. A pale yellow
powder 2c was obtained (114.6 mg, 94%). 1H

Crystallographic Analysis
The measurement was made
on a Rigaku XtaLAB mini diffractometer using graphite monochromated
Mo Kα radiation or a Rigaku XtaLAB P200 diffractometer using
multilayer mirror monochromated Mo Kα radiation (XtaLAB mini
for BOX 1b–d and complex 2a, 2c, 2d and XtaLAB P200 for complex 2b, 3a, 3c, 4a, 5b). The structures except for 3c were solved
by direct methods87,88 expanded using Fourier techniques.
Heavy-atom Patterson methods89 expanded
using Fourier techniques were conducted for 3c. The nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were refined using
the riding model. All calculations were performed using the CrystalStructure
crystallographic software package except for refinement,90−92 which was performed using SHELXL97, SHELXL2013, or SHELXL version
2014/7.93 Selected crystal collection parameters
are listed in Tables S1–S3.
