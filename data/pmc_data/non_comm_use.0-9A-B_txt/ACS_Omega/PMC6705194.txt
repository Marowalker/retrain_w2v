Nipah
virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, reported for
the recent severe outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness
in humans and animals, respectively. Many antiviral drugs have been
discovered to inhibit this pathogen, but none of them were that much
efficient. To overcome the complications associated with this severe
pathogenic virus, we have designed a multi-epitope subunit vaccine
using computational immunology strategies. Identification of structural
and nonstructural proteins of Nipah virus assisted in the vaccine
designing. The selected proteins are known to be involved in the survival
of the virus. The antigenic binders (B-cell, HTL, and CTL) from the
selected proteins were prognosticated. These antigenic binders will
be able to generate the humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity.
All the epitopes were united with the help of suitable linkers and
with an adjuvant at the N-terminal of the vaccine, for the enhancement
of immunogenicity. The physiological characterization, along with
antigenicity and allergenicity of the designed vaccine candidates,
was estimated. The 3D structure prediction and its validation were
performed. The validated vaccine model was then docked and simulated
with the TLR-3 receptor to check the stability of the docked complex.
This next-generation approach will provide a new vision for the development
of a high immunogenic vaccine against the NiV.

Introduction
Nipah virus is the
recently emerging zoonotic pathogen, belongs
to the Paramyxoviridae family has created the foremost threat among
public and animal health.1 This zoonotic
pathogen causes severe encephalitis in humans and respiratory problems
in animals, mainly pig.2 The fruit bat
(genus-Pteropus) is responsible for
spreading this infection by secreting the body fluid-like saliva or
urine on the fruit (raw date plum), which in turn, consumed by animals
and humans. According to the WHO report, the mortality rate is higher
in the Asian population as compared to other people (http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus).3 As per the National Centre for Disease
Control report, the first significant outbreak of the virus was seen
in Malaysia and Singapore between the year 1998 and 1999 with 276
cases (https://ncdc.gov.in/showfile.php?lid=229).4 Further, the next outbreak was observed
in 2001 in Bangladesh and West Bengal (Siliguri). Recently in 2018,
Nipah virus outbreak was seen in Kerala, an Indian state (mainly Kozhikode
and Malappuram districts) in which 17 people got clutched into the
hand of this severe infection and hence lost their life (https://www.who.int/csr/don/07-august-2018-nipah-virus-india/en/).5 It was identified that disease caused
in Malaysia and Bangladesh was due to two different Nipah virus strains,
which are termed as NiV M and NiV B, respectively. Further, investigations
showed that the NiV B strain is the most pathogenic as this strain
is responsible for more recent outbreaks.6 The clinical signs and symptoms associated with this viral infection
include fever, headache trailed by encephalitis, nausea, giddiness,
muscular pain, and respiratory illness.7 Subsequently, if the symptoms of the disease last for a long time,
it may lead to coma within 48 h.8 So far,
no effective vaccine or drug treatment is existing for the cure of
this disease in humans; the last option is the supportive care and
avoids close contact to infected ones.7 Many researchers are conscientious to find an effective treatment
for this severe zoonotic infection. An open-label clinical trial was
conducted with ribavirin, an antiviral drug, which showed a reduction
in the mortality rate, but the drug was not effective in the prevention
of the disease.9 Due to the unavailability
of treatment, the human and animal population is affecting severely.
There is an indispensable need to develop an effective regimen against
infectious diseases, which are the severe cause of fatality and mortality
worldwide. The postgenomic era supports the progression of computational
based vaccine deigning approaches to fight against the infectious
diseases. The aim of the rational vaccine approach is to identify
the antigenic epitopes, which have the potential to generate the robust
immune responses. Recently, some studies reported by Pandey et al.
in which they have shown the construction of a multi-epitope subunit
vaccine against the vector-borne diseases like malaria and visceral
leishmaniasis by exploring the salivary protein of the vectors (sandfly
or mosquito).10−12 However, a subunit vaccine against NiV was reported
utilizing immunoinformatic approaches where they have utilized three
NiV proteins for vaccine designing.13 Further,
the same approach was applied by Mohammed et al. (2019) in which they
have used the NiV G protein.14 Both studies
have exploited one or three proteins for NiV subunit vaccine designing,
but this study included more number of proteins, and the epitopes
were also vary from each other. Therefore, we can say that the designed
vaccine will be more immunogenic and efficacious against the NiV infection.

The multi-epitope subunit vaccine consists of highly antigenic
epitopes (B-cell, HTL, and CTL epitopes), and these MHC-restricted
binders were identified by multiple clones of T-cell receptors, which
in turn induce the potent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.15 The multi-epitope vaccine is a mixture of antigenic
epitopes derived from the proteins, which are highly pathogenic and
aid pathogen to cause disease. For a more potent immune response,
this vaccine was adjuvanted with the suitable adjuvant at the N-terminal.
Immunogenic adjuvant leads to more antibody production and helps in
providing the long-established protection. In comparison to the traditional
vaccine, the multi-epitope vaccines will be highly immunogenic with
less or no adverse events. The immunoinformatic approach makes the
path more comfortable and helps in the screening of antigenic epitopes
as well as the vaccine construct analyzed by various parameters, supports
the best candidate for the treatment of the disease (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of Nipah virus transmission and strategies
applied for the subunit vaccine designing against Nipah virus.

Here, in this study, we exploited the viral proteins,
which consist
of antigenic determinants and would be able to elicit the immune response
in the host body against the infection. P gene of Nipah virus encodes
for four proteins, which include phosphoprotein P (UniProt ID: H6V860) as well
as three accessory proteins, namely, protein W (UniProt ID: H6V848), nonstructural
protein V (UniProt ID: H6V847), and protein C (UniProt ID: Q4VCP8).16 At the time of transient expression, these proteins
show the IFN-antagonist activity. Due to which, they
are found to be the most important virulence factors and suitable
for vaccine designing. Among them, the protein W acts as the inhibitor
of the TLR-3 pathway, whereas proteins V and C function on the IFN
signaling by interacting with STAT1 and STAT2.17 Nucleocapsid protein N (UniProt ID: H6V857) is responsible
for the encapsidation of the virus genome and hence protects nuclease
activity. Further, the matrix protein, namely, protein M (UniProt
ID: Q4VCP7), is accountable for the structural integrity of the virion. Fusion
glycoprotein F0 (UniProt ID: D2DEC0) has shown a promising role in
the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane results
in the delivery of all the contents into the host cytoplasm. Glycoprotein
G (UniProt ID: Q4VCP5) modulates the exo-alpha-sialidase activity and contributes to the
attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors18 (Figure 2). To devise a potential and antigenic vaccine candidate,
we have designed a multi-epitope subunit vaccine by using immunoinformatic
approaches and also proved its potency to bind with the TLR-3 receptor
by molecular docking.

functional aspects.

Results and Discussion
Retrieval
of Structural and Nonstructural Nipah Virus Protein
Sequences for Vaccine Designing
The reported and experimentally
validated 8 pathogenic proteins of Nipah virus were selected. The
sequences of proteins [matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), fusion
glycoprotein F0 (F), and glycoprotein (G) and nonstructural proteins
named phosphoprotein (P), nonstructural protein (V), protein (W),
and Protein (C)] were retrieved from the UniProt database in a FASTA
format.

Homology Assessment of Selected NiV Proteins
The similarity
between the host and pathogen epitopes can lead to autoimmune diseases
(chances of cross reactivity19) and molecular
mimicry.20 In this study, a protein BLAST
analysis was done by using the selected NiV protein, and their homology
was checked against the human proteins. It was found that the chosen
proteins have shown less than 40% homology with the human proteins
and hence can be proved as excellent vaccine candidates for vaccine
construction.

Continuous B-Cell Epitopes Mapping
B-cell epitopes
are responsible for the generation of humoral immune response by producing
class-switched antibodies against the pathogen. The ABCpred server
was used for the B-cell epitope prediction, which envisages the antigenic
epitopes based on the artificial neural network with a precision rate
of 65.99%. The epitope selection was based on the highest score secured
by the epitopes with a default threshold of 0.51. So, from 8 proteins,
the single most top scorer epitope got selected (overall 8 B-cell
epitopes). These epitopes were further utilized to produce multi-epitope
vaccine candidates (Table S1).

Helper T-Lymphocyte
Epitopes Mapping
Helper T-cells
are the essential cell of the immune system and are responsible for
adaptive immunity. The IDEB server was used for the prediction of
MHC II antigenic binders. The HTL epitopes were sorted based on the
lowest percentile rank and IC50 value. The epitopes obtained
with the lowest percentile rank has an excellent binding affinity;
therefore, for each selected protein, the score with the lowest percentile
rank was selected. The next parameter includes the sorting of peptides
based on the IC50 value: the peptides <50 nM considered
to have the highest binding affinity, <500 nM intermediate affinity,
and <5000 nM have the lowest affinity for the T-cell receptor (Table S2).

HTL Epitopes Selection
Based on HLA-Restricted Alleles
The human leucocyte antigen
(HLA) ligand-binding step is usually
considered to be extra specific other than succeeding levels of the
antigen processing pathways and thus crucial for vaccine designing.
After literature survey and WHO report, it was found that the areas
that are massively affected by NiV infection, for instance, Australia,
Africa, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, and so on, by considering this
data, we have selected the alleles as per the distribution of the
disease. All the alleles have different binding preferences; therefore,
the allelic selection was made with the help of the Allelefrequencies.net database.
Here are the selected alleles: “HLA-DRB1*07:01, HLA-DRB5*01:01,
HLA-DRB1*13:02, and HLA-DRB1*15:01”, which found to be circulated
over these countries and cover the specific population (Table S2).

Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte
Epitopes Mapping
CTL epitopes
prediction is the pivotal step in vaccine designing as they are necessary
for the clearance of intracellular pathogens by arbitrating cell-mediated
immunity. Here, the potential CTL epitope for 8-sorted protein sequences
was predicted as per 3 supertypes, namely, A2, A3, and B7 with a threshold
score of 0.75. These selected supertypes provide maximum population
coverage of 88.3% of the entire world population.21 Further, the antigenic binders were selected based on the
highest obtained score. This way for each input protein, three epitopes
were selected belongs to 3 supertypes, and overall, 24 CTL epitopes
were sorted for the construction of the subunit vaccine (Table S3).

Devising Potential Multi-Epitope
Vaccine Candidate
Next, the immunogenic epitopes were united
with the help of linkers
B-cell (KK linker), HTL (AAY linker), and CTL (GPGPG linker) along
with adjuvant (β-defensin- TLR-3 agonist). For the formulation
of a subunit vaccine, adjuvants are the significant aspects, which
improve the immunogenicity of vaccine by enhancing the immunogenic
responses analogous to the natural immune response. The designed constructs
were composed of 8 B-cell epitopes, 8 HTL epitopes, and 24 CTL epitopes.
Total 6 constructs were developed with different combinations, by
keeping adjuvant at the N-terminal of the sequence (Scheme S1).

Physiochemical Characterization, Antigenicity,
and Allergenicity
Prediction of Designed Vaccine
Investigation of physiochemical
properties of the 6-designed vaccine candidates was predicted with
the help of the ExPASy ProtParam server (Table S4). The estimated values have shown that all the developed
vaccine candidates were stable and met entirely the standards, which
are necessary for the formulation of the vaccine. Second, the obtained
score from the VaxiJen server v2.0 was higher than 0.5 for each vaccine
candidate, which signifies that the designed candidates could be a
probable antigen and may have the potential to provoke the immune
response inside the host body. Allergenicity prediction was achieved
with the help of the AllerTOP server, which predicted that the nature
of the vaccine protein was nonallergenic (not able to cause any side
effects) for all 6 vaccine candidates. Hence, after predicting the
overall properties of the vaccine candidates, it was concluded that
all designed vaccines constructs were stable, antigenic, and nonallergenic.

Vaccine Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction and Refinement
The folding and unfolding patterns of the tertiary structure were
obtained with the help of the RaptorX server. All the designed 6 vaccine
candidates were subjected to tertiary structure prediction. RaptorX
predicted the tertiary structure in the PDB file along with various
parameters (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 (A) (a)–(f) Tertiary structures of different
subunit vaccine candidate obtained from template-based homology modelling. (B) Representation and comparative analysis of the structural
difference between the refined and nonrefined tertiary structures
of designed vaccine candidates.

Among predicted 6 structures, the best vaccine candidate was chosen
based on the P value. As per the selection norms,
smaller P value (i.e., values less than 10–3) indicates a good model standard. The predicted P value for the best model (model-1, presented as Figure 3A(a)) was 1.48 × 10–3, which was more modest in comparison to other predicted
models. The obtained uGDT (unnormalized global distance test) and
GDT score of the selected model were 148 and 25, respectively. The
uGDT score >50 exemplifies the good model quality. The 3D structure
obtained from RaptorX was then subjected for the refinement to the
ModRefiner server. That server shaped the predicted tertiary structure
to a refined tertiary structure. Further, the refined and nonrefined
models (selected model) were superimposed on each other to identify
the differences between them (Figure 3B).

Avouchment of Predicted 3D Model of the Vaccine
Candidate
The validation of the refined model was achieved
with the help
of the Ramachandran plot assessment servers: RAMPAGE and PROCHECK.
After the comparative analysis, it was found that the RAMPAGE server
peculiarly predicted 92.7% residues in the energetically favored region,
whereas 2.4% residues in the disallowed area and 4.9% in the allowed
part. PROCHECK data showed that 86.9% of residues lies in the favored
area, while 10.8% residues and 1.8% were found in the additional and
generously allowed area, respectively, followed by 0.6% in the disallowed
area. This data represents that the structure obtained after refinement
has high resolution and structural quality with minimum steric atomic
clashes between the residues (Figure 4).

(A) RAMPAGE and (B) PROCHECK servers for the validation of the designed
tertiary structure of selected subunit vaccine candidate.

Tertiary Structure Fixation of Immune Cell Receptor and Immunogenic
Ligand
The tertiary structure of the target immune cell receptor,
that is, Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR-3), was derived from the Protein
Data bank (PDB ID: 2a0Z). Both the receptor (TLR-3) and ligand (vaccine candidate) were
subjected to the PDB Hydro server for structure fixation and solvation
removal. This server provides the more refined structures of receptor
and ligand, which were fixed and have no solvent molecules. Further,
the model was selected for docking and dynamics simulation.

Molecular
Docking of Antigenic Vaccine Candidate with TLR-3
Receptor
Protein–Protein docking was performed between
the receptor (TLR-3) and ligand (vaccine candidate) with the help
of the HADDOCK server. This server needs ambiguous interaction restraints
(AIRs), which denotes the active and passive residue numbers. Active
residues are involved in the interaction between the molecules and
accessible solvent, while passive residues are surface neighbor active
residues, which are solvent accessible. Here, TLR-3 (PDB ID: 2A0Z) was conjugated
with the vaccine candidate to make the stable protein complex. The
server predicted 7 clusters and 42 structures. The result was presented
with their respective HADDOCK scores, cluster size, van der Waals
energy, electrostatic energy, desolvation energy, restraints violation
energy, buried surface area, and Z score. Among them,
cluster 1 showed the lowest Z score value, that is,
−1.5, HADDOCK scores −11.2, cluster size 13, van der
Waals energy −81.5, electrostatic energy −515.2, desolvation
energy −18.4, restraints violation energy 1917.8, and buried
surface area 3617.9. For more precise selection, the finest structure
of cluster 1 was chosen for molecular dynamics simulation (Figures 5 and 6).

color, whereas red color represents the vaccine candidate, and green
color represents the interaction between receptor and vaccine candidate.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
of the Docked Complex
For the evaluation of stability and
physical interactions between
the atoms and molecules, the molecular dynamics simulation was performed.
Temperature and pressure were equilibrated by applying NVT and NPT
ensemble with the period of 100 ps. The estimated potential energy
for stabilizing the system was −2 × 106 kJ
mol–1. The stability of the final vaccine candidate
was appraised by using the GROMOS 96a force field. The RMSD plot obtained
for the backbone of the docked complex represents an initial deviation
at 0.5 nm. Gradually, it increases with time until 6 ns, afterward
it becomes stable until 10 ns with an RMSD value of 0.9 nm. The RMSF
plot showed that the highest fluctuation among the residues ranges
from residue numbers 400–600 and becomes steady after 600 residues
with an average RMSF value of ∼0.7 nm. The RMSD and RMSF levels
of the complex suggested that the docked complex was pliable and stable
(Figure 7).

Discussion
Nipah virus is the recently emerging deadliest
zoonotic pathogen,
which is severely affecting the worldwide population. Its pathogenesis
ranges from acute infection to chronic encephalitis. The Southeast
Asia region is severely affected by the NiV infection with an estimated
fatality rate of 40–77% (2001–2018 WHO report: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus).3 The health of the world population
is the main apprehension as the disease can cause high virulence in
humans.22 Until now, no approved medication
is available for the treatment of the disease.

As discussed
in the Introduction part,
ribavirin, an antiviral drug, was introduced during the first significant
outbreak, and there was a reduction in the mortality rate, but the
drug was not effective in complete prevention of the disease.23 Further, the same drug was given in combination
with chloroquine, and it was found that the drug was unable to prevent
death in the hamster model infected by Nipah and Hendra viruses.24 In 2012, a subunit vaccine was reported by Bossaert
Katharine N. to protect the African green monkeys from Nipah virus
infection.25 But later in 2015, the detailed
analysis was performed on African green monkey against NiV infection
by Johnston et al., and they recognize 100% chances of relapse encephalitis
in the animals.26 However, during the recent
outbreaks, the previously developed drug favipiravir was used as a
regimen for human use.27 The ability of
the drug to inhibit the full range of RNA viruses makes it remarkable,
but certain complications have been observed, such as contraction
in the lungs.

Apart from this, many vectored vaccines, for instance,
the vesicular
stomatitis virus vaccine recombinant28 and
live attenuated,29 recombinant measles
virus vaccine expressing the NiV G protein,30 and VLP-based vaccines have shown good immune response in animal
models: African green monkeys and hamsters.31 The bivalent rabies virus vaccine is in pipeline against the NiV
and rabies virus, as it has shown good immune response in animal model.32 The described vaccines were mainly tested on
animals and not licensed for the NiV treatment in humans. All reported
vaccines primarily composed of single viral protein, and it is a well-known
phenomenon that, RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, to prompt
alteration of viral genome and proteome. Therefore, constant antigenic
changes contribute to the increased pathogenicity or virulence and
early ineffectiveness of vaccine, which may be a drawback for a single
viral protein vaccine.33 However, on the
other hand, the multisubunit vaccine acquires the most antigenic part
of the viral proteins to become more potent, and it can fight against
RNA virus evolution efficiently. Epitopes identified from the viral
proteins will activate the APCs and hence induces the costimulatory
molecules to produce a robust immune response. As per the literature
survey, TLR-3 was involved in TRIF/TRAM-mediated Th1 signaling activation,
which in turn provide defense against the viral diseases. This approach
can be validated by the use of a TLR-3 agonist as an adjuvant, which
helps the host to fight against the intracellular microbes.34

In 2005, it was reported that the NiV
protein W stimulates the
TLR-3 receptor, which inhibits IFN beta promotor activation.35 Further, in 2010, it was shown that during Nipah
virus infection in the endothelial cell majority of the NiV protein
W, localize in cytoplasm and generate an IFN beta response, whereas
in M17 neuronal cell (infected with Nipah virus) NiV protein W, tend
to localize in the nucleus and blocks TLR-3 signaling.36 In both conditions, TLR-3 expression increases
and acts as a significant contributing factor in NiV infection. The
selected Nipah virus proteins used for this study have already been
reported previously and experimentally validated.37 In this study, we have applied the next-generation vaccine
designing approach to design a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine,
which can be potent enough to generate the immunological responses
against the pathogen.38 The selected viral
proteins have shown no similarity with the human proteins and hence
prove to be the potential vaccine candidates. When the antigenic part
from B-cell, HTL, and CTL of different proteins joined with the adjuvant,
they displayed high antigenicity. The physiochemical parameter data
suggested that the designed vaccine was stable with half of >30
h
in mammalian reticulocytes. The Log P value of the
construct was positive, indicating the hydrophobic nature and hence
suggested that a liposomal delivery system will the right way for
vaccine delivery. The predicted tertiary structure with the minimum P value indicates the high model quality. From the ramachandran
plot analysis, higher amount of amino acids was found to be in the
favored region, which was considerable and defined the protein stability.
The docked complex of the vaccine construct and TLR-3 receptor gives
a lower score, confer the highest binding energy. The molecular dymanics
simulation calculated the fluctuation and deviation of amino acids
in the docked complex, and with this data, it can be concluded that
the complex was flexible and stable. All the findings from the imunoinformatic
approach suggested that the intended vaccine candidate may further
undergo in vitro and in vivo experimental analyses for the development
of a potential vaccine against Nipah virus infection.

Methodology
Selection
of Nipah Virus Structural and Nonstructural Proteins
To Design Multi-Epitope Subunit Vaccine
The Nipah virus structural
and nonstructural proteins were identified with the help of a literature
survey. The sequences of the 8 experimentally validated pathogenic
viral proteins (UniProt Proteome ID: UP000103103)39 named as the matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein
(N), fusion glycoprotein F0 (F), and glycoprotein (G) as well as nonstructural
proteins called phosphoprotein (P), nonstructural protein (V), protein
(W), and protein (C) were retrieved from the UniProt database in the
FASTA format. Apart from this protein above sequences, β-defensin,
a 45 amino acid long chain retrieved from NCBI (National Centre for
Biotechnology Information:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) had been used as an adjuvant,
which was imperative to generate the efficient or potential immunogenic
responses.40

Homology Assessment of
Nipah Virus Proteins
Protein
blast of each selected protein was done to find out the homology of
the chosen protein sequence with the human proteome by using NCBI
Protein–Protein Blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome). Homology of viral protein with human proteome will interfere with
the immunogenic response of the designed vaccine. Therefore, there
should be no or least homology (<40%) with the human proteome.20

Continuous/Linear B-Cell Epitopes Mapping
In this study,
B-cell epitopes for the selected antigenic protein sequences were
predicted with the help of the publicly available ABCpred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/). This server utilizes artificial and recurrent neural network based
on machine learning techniques for the prediction of B-cell epitopes
with fixed length patterns. The obtained output was verified by 5-fold
cross-corroboration and provided an overall or maximum accuracy of
65.93%.41,42

Helper T-Lymphocyte (Th-Cells)
Epitopes Mapping
Prediction of immunogenic HTL epitopes was
achieved with the help
of the easily accessible online IEDB server (Immune Epitope Database
and Analysis Resources: http://www.iedb.org/). With the assistance of this server, experimentally validated epitopes
(from different species) involved in infection or immune related diseases
can be investigated.43 Currently, the updated
single-data repository encompasses around 260,000 epitopes, which
help in the designing of vaccines. Consequently, the prediction of
HTL epitopes was accomplished by utilizing consensus ANN and SMM methods.
The sorting of antigenic epitopes with the highest binding affinity
was done based on their lowest percentile rank and IC50 value.

Identification of HLA-Restricted CTL Epitopes
After
the prediction of HTL epitopes, the sorting depends on the specific
criteria as discussed above, and allele selection was one of them.
For the assortment of allele diversity and geographical distribution,
The Allele Frequency Net Database (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/default.asp) was used. This freely available database is a complete suite for
the deposition of allelic frequency information from diverse polymorphic
regions in the human genome. The Asia-Pacific region is profoundly
affected by this severe infection (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/outbreaks/distribution-map.html).44

Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte
Epitopes Mapping
The online
and freely available server NetCTL 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL/) was used to predict the antigenic CTL epitopes for the selected
Nipah virus proteins. The current version of server provides an integrative
output by combining proteasomal cleavage (C-terminal), TAP transport
efficiency, and MHC class I affinity, which restricted to 12 MHC I
supertypes. This server exploits the artificial neural network and
hence offers the most antigenic epitopes with their respective scores.45

Devising Multi-Epitope Vaccine by Combining
Immune Cell Epitopes
For devising the multi-epitope subunit
vaccine, the antigenic epitopes
of B-cell, HTL, and CTL were fused with the assistance of linkers.
The N-terminal of the designed vaccine sequence was adjuvanted the
TLR-3 agonist, β-defensin. Defensins possess the antimicrobial
as well as antiviral activity and have the ability to recruit the
antigen-presenting immune cells having MHC-I and MHC-II. Hence, it
can be concluded that β-defensin can induce potential immunogenic
responses similar to natural immune responses.46 EAAAK,47 the helix forming linker,
was added, which was used to link the adjuvant and first epitope of
the sequence. Linkers are requisite for the enhanced expression, stability,
and folding of the protein, and they do it so by parting the functional
domains.48 For each immune cell, different
linkers were used such as to link B-cell epitopes together, the KK49 linker was used; for linking HTL epitopes together,
the GPGPG linker50 was added; and concurrently,
for connecting CTL epitopes, the AAY linker was appended.51

Determination of Antigenicity and Allergenicity
of the Designed
Vaccine Candidate
The antigenicity prediction was achieved
with the help of VaxiJen server v2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html), for the robust validation of antigenicity. The difference between
antigens and nonantigens was done by utilizing five training sets
of antigens with a prediction accuracy of 70–89%.52 Allergenicity of all the six combinations was
checked by the AllerTOPv.2.0 server; this was performed to analyze
that the designed vaccine candidate will not cause any allergy upon
administration. This server predicts the allergenicity with 86.7%
sensitivity, 90.7% specificity, and 88.7% accuracy (AllerTOP v.2:
a server for in silico prediction of allergens).

Physicochemical
Characterizations of the Designed Vaccine Candidate
The physicochemical
characterization of the developed vaccine was
achieved through the help of the freely available ExPASy (Expert Protein
Analysis System) ProtParam server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). This server envisages the properties of the vaccine candidate,
which includes the amino acid composition, molecular weight, extension
coefficient, theoretical isoelectric point, instability index, the
estimated half-life of the candidate, as well as aliphatic index and
the GRAVY (grand average of hydropathicity) score.53 The property prediction was performed for all designed
vaccine candidates.

Tertiary Structure Prediction of the Designed
Vaccine along
with the Structure Refinement and Avouchment
The structure
prediction was done with the help of the readily accessible RaptorX
server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) server. This server predicted the model quality by calculating
the solvent accessibility, P value, uGDT (GDT), disordered
regions, and pocket multiplicity.54 After
obtaining the modeled structure with the aid of RaptorX, the structure
was subjected to refinement, and this process was achieved with the
help of the ModRefiner (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/) online server. This server produces an initial model by predicting
backbone topology, a hydrogen bond, and a side chain position closer
to the initial structure and hence generated the refined model, which
is not restrained by the input model.55 Despite that, validation of the predicted refined structure was
done with the help of two different servers: RAMPAGE (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~rapper/rampage.php) and PROCHECK (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/PROCHECK/). These servers predicted the overall geometry of the residues by
examining the stereochemical quality of protein. Hence, it provides
the distributive data of amino acids in favored, allowed, and sterically
disallowed regions (exception glycine and proline residue), which
confirm the stability of the modeled structure.56

Fixation of Refined Tertiary Structures of
Vaccine Candidate
and Immune Cell TLR-3 Receptor
Before proceeding to dock,
fixation of PDB structure was done to remove the solvent molecule
and fix the missing atoms. The PDB structure of the receptor TLR-3
was obtained from NCBI (PDB ID: 2A0Z). This PDB structure, along with the
vaccine candidates, was fixed by a server PDB Hydro (http://lorentz.immstr.pasteur.fr/pdb_hydro.php). This server generates the rotamer of the lowest van der Waals
energy of given the PDB file and also identifies missing side chains.
It works on an algorithm, which fits alanine in the place of the lost
side chain to get an ideal confirmation of peptide bonds.57

Assessment of Molecular Interaction of Immunogenic
Vaccine Candidate
with Immune Cell Receptor TLR-3 by Performing Molecular Docking
Molecular docking between the TLR-3 (receptor) and vaccine (ligand)
was presented with the help of online accessible HADDOCK: High Ambiguity
Driven protein–protein DOCKing server (https://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-easy.html). This online server combines the information from
biochemical bioinformatics or biophysical method to improve scoring
and sampling. This server produces a docking score along with other
parameters like van der Waals energy, Z score, etc.
The Z score denotes the standard deviations of a given cluster concerning
the mean of all the groups generated. The best-docked multi-epitope
is one with the minimum Z score. HADDOCK also produces
several plots for better understanding of the docking result. These
plots display the comparison of the best-docked structure with all
generated structures concerning docking score, RMSD, etc.58

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Vaccine-Immuned
Cell Receptor-Docked
Complex
The molecular dynamics simulation analyzed the nonbonded
interactions between the protein molecules with the help of the Groningen
Machine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) molecular dynamic package.59 Here, the molecular dynamics simulation was
performed for the docked complex of the vaccine candidate and TLR-3
receptor, obtained from the HADDOCK server. The atomistic GROMOS 96a
force field was employed for the simulation process.60 The system was well equilibrated, and charge neutralization
was done using suitable ions. The system temperature and pressure
were equilibrated at 300 k and 1 bar for an equilibration period of
100 ns, respectively. Minimization of energy was done using the steepest
descent algorithm. Last, MD simulation was set for 10 ns, and respective
RMSD (backbone residues) and RMSF (fluctuation of side chain residues)
were determined to achieve a stable and flexible vaccine complex.60−62
