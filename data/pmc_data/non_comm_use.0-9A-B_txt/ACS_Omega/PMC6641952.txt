Conformational
characteristics of poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC)
and poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) have been revealed via molecular
orbital (MO) calculations and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments
on model compounds with the same bond sequences as those of the polycarbonates.
Bond conformations derived from the MO calculations on the models
were in exact agreement with those from the NMR experiments. Both
PEC and PPC were indicated to adopt distorted conformations including
a number of gauche bonds and cover themselves with negative charges,
thus failing to form a regular packing and remaining amorphous. The
MO data were applied to the refined rotational isomeric state (RIS)
calculations to yield configurational properties such as the characteristic
ratio, its temperature coefficient, the configurational entropy, and
average geometrical parameters of unperturbed PEC and PPC chains.
In the RIS calculations on PPC, the regio- and stereosequences were
generated according to the Bernoulli trial or Markov stochastic process.
In consequence, it was shown that the configurational properties of
PPC do not depend significantly on its regio- and stereoregularities.
The internal energy contribution to rubberlike chain elasticity, calculated
from the temperature coefficient of the characteristic ratio, has
indicated the possibility that PEC and PPC will behave as elastomers.
The practical applications and potential utilizations of the polycarbonates
are discussed on the basis of the conformational characteristics and
configurational properties.

Introduction
If noxious fumes generated
in industrial processes were dispersed
into the atmosphere, animals including human beings and plants would
be seriously injured or, at their worst, killed. However, chemists
have settled such problems by fixing the gases in solids. For example,
in alkali industries, gaseous chlorine generated in sodium production
has been chemically changed to useful polymers such as poly(vinyl
chloride).1 As another example, one may
mention carbon dioxide. Of course, carbon dioxide itself is not necessarily
a harmful substance but, on the contrary, a nutrient source indispensable
for plants. To suppress the global warming, however, we have been
strongly required to control the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

In 1969, Inoue, Koinuma, and Tsuruta2,3 reported a
reaction scheme to synthesize poly(alkyl carbonate)s, that is, alternating
copolymers of epoxides with carbon dioxide (Scheme 1). In the reaction, carbon dioxide, the most
inactive (i.e., thermodynamically dead) carbon source, is utilized.
Because of the growing worldwide interest in global warming, polymer
chemists and engineers have been paying particular attention to polycarbonates.
If carbon dioxide emitted from combustion of natural gas, petroleum,
and coal can be effectively absorbed on basic polymers such as poly(ethylene
imine)4−6 and its derivatives7 and
analogues,8 the polycarbonates may be produced
from the collected gas, and consequently, CO2 fixation
will be realized.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aliphatic Polycarbonates from Epoxides
and Carbon Dioxide:
R = H, Poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC) and R = CH3, Poly(propylene
carbonate) (PPC)
Of the aliphatic polycarbonates, PEC (Figure 1) and PPC were synthesized
early2,3 but have not been easy to use either as
hard plastics or as flexible
rubbers because glass transitions of PEC and PPC occur around room
temperature (ca. 20 °C) and human body temperature (35–40
°C), respectively.9 Therefore, the
polycarbonates will become hard in cold areas (or seasons) but flexible
in hot ones.

Figure 1 (a) PEC and (b) PPC. The bonds are designated as shown,
and x is the degree of polymerization. To facilitate
the refined
rotational isomeric state (RIS) calculations, the polymeric chains
have been assumed to be terminated by a methyl group.

Inasmuch as PPC has an asymmetric carbon atom in
the repeating
unit, its primary structure is determined by two kinds of configurations:
stereo- and regioisomerizations. The former means the existence of
(R)- and (S)-isomers (see Figure 2). The latter means
the formation of three kinds of linkages between the monomeric units:
head-to-tail (abbreviated as H–T), head-to-head (H–H),
and tail-to-tail (T–T) (see Figure 3). For these reasons, polymer chemists have
challenged to develop stereospecific catalysts for controlling its
regio- and stereoregularities,10−22 in expectation that fully regular PPCs might crystallize and exhibit
so large an elastic modulus and so high a glass transition temperature
(Tg) as to be used as hard plastics.

Figure 2 Stereosequences
of PPC: (a) (R)- and (b) (S)-isomers;
(c) (R,R)-,
(d) (R,S)-, (e) (S,R)-, and (f) (S,S)-diads. (R,R)- and (S,S)-diad combinations are designated as meso, and (R,S)- and (S,R)-diad ones as racemo. When the polymeric chain is composed of only meso (racemo) couplings, the stereoregularity is termed
isotactic (syndiotactic).

Figure 3 Regiosequences of PPC. Definition of (a) orthodromic (O) and (b) antidromic (A) directions. Four possible
combinations of (O)- and (A)-directions
between neighboring units: (c) (O,O), head-to-tail (H–T); (d) (O,A), head-to-head (H–H); (e) (A,A), tail-to-head (T–H); and (f) (A,O), tail-to-tail (T–T). The tail-to-head linkage
is included in H–T; therefore, the three expressions, H–T,
H–H, and T–T, are used herein.

According to a cardinal principle of polymer science and
molecular
biology, “higher-order structures, physical properties, and
functions of a polymer originate from its primary structure”;
it is of fundamental importance to reveal the conformational characteristics
of PEC and PPC and, furthermore, to evaluate their configurational
properties. This is the prime aim of this study. The conformational
analysis of model compounds with the same bond sequences as those
of the polycarbonates, ethylene glycol bis(methyl carbonate) (E_model, Figure 4) for PEC and propylene
glycol bis(methyl carbonate) (P_model) for PPC, has been carried out
by molecular orbital (MO) calculations and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) experiments. The MO energies and geometrical parameters were
introduced into the refined RIS scheme23 to yield configurational properties of the two polycarbonates. Then,
stochastic processes based on the Bernoulli trial and first-order
Markov chain24,25 were employed to generate regio-
and stereosequences of PPC to elucidate how its properties depend
on the two kinds of configurations. Herein, the procedures and results
are described in detail. On the basis of the structural information
thus established, physical properties, practical uses, and potential
applications of PEC and PPC are discussed.

Figure 4 Model compounds of PEC
and PPC: (a) for PEC, ethane-1,2-diyl dimethyl
bis(carbonate) (E_model) and (b) for PPC, dimethyl propane-1,2-diyl
bis(carbonate) (P_model). As indicated, the bonds are designated,
and the methylene and methine protons are labeled for NMR analysis.
(R)- and (S)-P_models yield the
identical NMR spectra; therefore, (R)-P_model is
exclusively employed herein.

Results and Discussion
NMR Experiments
Figure 5a shows 1H NMR satellite
peaks observed
from the naturally abundant 13CH2 group of the
E_model. The spectrum simulation reproduced the observation well and
yielded the JHH and J′HH values. In Table 1, the two vicinal couplings are given for
each NMR solvent and temperature. As explained in the “Methods” section, the pt and pg values were derived from eqs 8 and 9 with the two sets of JT and JG. The sum of pt and pg, thus obtained was slightly different
from unity and hence divided by the sum to fulfill eq 10. The pt values of bond 5 (Table 2) are so small as to indicate a strong gauche preference of
the CH2–CH2 bond, and the pt value tends to increase with temperature and decrease
slightly with solvent polarity.

MO Calculations
Table 5 shows conformer free energies of the E_model. Of the
eight conformers that the B3LYP optimization gave, the most stable
conformation is tg+t (Figure 6a), indicating a gauche preference of the
central CH2–CH2 bond. It has been found
that the aromatic and aliphatic esters with the C(=O)–O–CH2–CH2–O–C(=O) bond sequence
show strong gauche preferences in the central CH2–CH2 bond. The free energies of the tgt conformation were evaluated
as, for example, −1.1 kcal mol–1 for poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET)26 and −1.2
kcal mol–1 for poly(ethylene succinate) (PES).27 These ΔGk values are comparable to that of PEC (Table 5). Therefore, it can be concluded
that the tgt stability is inherent in the C(=O)–O–CH2–CH2–O–C(=O) sequence
of the esters. The ttg+ conformer also has a small free
energy of 0.1–0.3 kcal mol–1 as compared
with that of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (1.3 kcal mol–1).28−30 It is also known that the ttg conformations of PET
and PES have relatively small ΔGk values of 0.5 and 0.3 kcal mol–1, respectively.26,27 In the ttg+ conformation
(Figure 6b), a short
C=O···C–H contact (2.40 Å) can be
found between the carbonyl and methylene groups via the gauche O–CH2 bond, and the involved O=C–O–CH2–C–H atoms lie on a plane. The above results
indicate that the PEC chain tends to adopt distorted structures with
a number of gauche bonds. In Table 2, the bond conformations calculated from the ΔGk values are listed. As for
the CH2–CH2 bond, the MO calculations
agree satisfactorily with set A and exactly with set B. These facts
show the reliability of the MO energies.

Table 6 shows the
ΔGk values of P_model.
Its asymmetric carbon renders the 27 (=33) conformers unique
and irreducible, and the pendent methyl group gives rise to intramolecular
steric repulsions; however, P_model exhibits the conformational preferences
and intramolecular interactions similar to those found for the E_model.
A number of conformers have negative ΔGk’s. In particular, those of g+g+t and tg+t and g+g–g– are largely negative; therefore,
PPC will also adopt distorted structures. The bond conformations of
P_model, calculated from the ΔGk values, are listed in Table 7. For the CH2–CH(CH3) bond, the magnitude relation pt ≪ pg– < pg+ holds, thus being consistent with
the NMR analysis. On the basis of the good agreement between theory
and experiment, we advanced to the refined RIS calculations on PEC
and PPC with the ΔGk energies and geometrical parameters (Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information) of the models.

The characteristic ratios
(⟨r2⟩0/nl2), its temperature coefficients (dln⟨r2⟩0/dT),
configurational entropies (Sconf), and
averaged geometrical parameters of unperturbed PEC and PPC chains
at 25 °C are presented in Table 8. The PPC chain was assumed to be isotactic and include
only the H–T linkage. The temperature coefficient at T0 was calculated by the finite-difference method 1  where T0 and ΔT were set equal to 298.15 K (25 °C) and 1.00 K, respectively.

The
⟨r2⟩0/nl2 values are 2.42–2.54 (PEC) and 2.26–2.36
(PPC), much smaller than those of PEO (5.2 at 34.5 °C),29,32,33 PPO (6.0 at 50 °C),31,34 and polyethylene (6.4–8.3 around 140 °C).35−39 This is because both PEC and PPC have strong preferences for gauche
conformations. The dln⟨r2⟩0/dT values of PEC and PPC show solvent dependence;
the values decrease with increasing solvent polarity. The temperature
coefficient of PEC changes its sign between gas and chloroform, whereas
that of PPC always stays positive. These results will be discussed
in the “Mechanical Properties”
section.

The configurational entropy (often termed conformational
entropy)
can be calculated from 2  where R is the gas
constant, x is the degree of polymerization, T is
the absolute temperature, and Z is the partition
function of the whole chain. At a phase transition such as melting,
the Sconf value corresponds to the entropy
change at constant volume and is related to that ((ΔS)p) at constant pressure and
that (ΔSv) due
to the volume change (ΔV) by40,41 3  where
ΔSv = (α/β)ΔV with
α and β being the thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal
compressibility, respectively. The Sconf/(ΔS)p ratio has
been estimated as, for example, 0.8–0.9 for polyethers and
polythioethers42 and 0.5–0.7 for
polyesters,27 while amorphous elastomers
exhibit comparatively small Sconf/(ΔS)p values such as 0.5 (natural
rubber) and 0.6 (gutta percha).41 Therefore,
amorphous PEC and PPC would also have somewhat smaller Sconf/(ΔS)p ratios than those of semicrystalline polymers.

The characteristic
ratios of the PPC chains with different regio-
and stereosequences were also calculated. Then, the ΔGk values on the chloroform
solution were employed because the dielectric constant (ca. 3) of
PPC43 is comparatively close to that (4.8)
of chloroform; the RIS calculations are expected to represent the
amorphous PPC chain. According to the Bernoulli trial, the ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 value of the infinite PPC chain (degree of polymerization x = ∞) was calculated as a function of portho and pR, as shown in Figure 7a. The portho and pR values change at an interval of 0.1. The
stereoinversion ((R) → (S) or (S) → (R)) and regioinversion
((O) → (A) or (A) → (O)) were assumed to occur independently
of each other (the independent-event model). In the Bernoulli trial,
the calculated quantities f(p)’s
always satisfy f(portho) = f(1 – portho) and f(pR) = f(1 – pR) (see Table S3, Supporting Information); thus, the f(p) is symmetric
with respect to portho = 0.5 and pR = 0.5. The average of f(portho) and f(1 – portho) is given in Table 8. Similarly, in the
Markov process, such symmetries were considered, and the average values
were adopted.

Figure 7 Characteristic ratios (⟨r2⟩0/nl2’s)
of PPC, derived
from the refined RIS calculations with the Bernoulli trial. (a) (Independent-event
model) the regio- and stereosequences were generated independently
of each other, and the ⟨r2⟩0/nl2’ values are plotted
against pR for different portho and (pH–T, pH–H, pT–T) values: 0.0 and (1.00, 0.00, 0.00) (open circle);
0.10 and (0.82, 0.09, 0.09) (filled circle); 0.20 and (0.68, 0.16,
0.16) (open square); 0.30 and (0.58, 0.21, 0.21) (filled square);
0.40 and (0.52, 0.24, 0.24) (open triangle); and 0.50 and (0.50, 0.25,
0.25) (filled triangle). (b) (Synchronous model) the regio- and stereoforms
are changed synchronously: (O,R)
→ (A,S), (A,R) → (O,S), (O,S) → (A,R), or (A,S)
→ (O,R). The solid line represents
a cubic function fitted to the calculated date (open circle).

In Figure 7a, therefore,
the ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 value is plotted within ranges of 0.0 ≤ portho ≤ 0.5 and 0.0 ≤ pR ≤ 0.5. When pR = 0.0 (isotactic), the characteristic
ratio increases from 2.26 to 2.66 with increasing portho. In the range of pR = 0.4–0.5 (atactic), the plotted data overlap
each other at ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 ≈ 2.54; the stereochemically
irregular PPC chains have almost the same average dimension independently
of the regioregularity. It should be noted that the Bernoulli trial
cannot generate the syndiotactic chain.

Most of the synthesized
PPC chains keep the chirality of propylene
oxide and include the H–T linkage predominantly. However, propylene
oxide rarely undergoes abnormal ring-opening, and consequently, the
PPC chain randomly includes adjoining H–H and T–T linkages,
between which the chiral form is different from those of the neighbors;14,21 therefore, both stereoinversion (R) → (S) or (S) → (R)
and regioinversion (O) → (A) or (A) → (O) occur simultaneously.
However, the probability of the defect stays as small as several percent.
Thus, the configuration of the PPC chain with the defects may be represented
by the Bernoulli trial in which both regio- and stereoinversions are
synchronized (the synchronous model). In Figure 7b, the characteristic ratios thus calculated
are plotted as a function of pR (=portho). The plot is also symmetric
with respect to pR =
0.5 and portho = 0.5. The curve can be
seen to decrease gradually with an increase in pR; the synchronous inversions tend to render
the PPC chain more contracted. However, the change in ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 between pR =
0.0 and 0.5 is ca. 10%.

In Figure 8a, the
⟨r2⟩0/nl2 values calculated according to the Markov
process are shown as a function of pH–T and pmeso. Then, the pH–T and pmeso values were changed from zero to unity at intervals
of 0.1, and the contour lines in Figure 8 were drawn by interpolating the two-dimensional
data meshes. In pmeso = 0.0 (syndiotactic), the ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 value increases
from 1.98 to 2.80 with increasing pH–T, whereas, in pmeso =
1.0 (isotactic), it decreases from 3.08 to 2.26. Therefore, its maximum
can be found at pmeso = 1.0 and pH–T = 0.0: either
(O,R)- and (A,R)-units or (O,S)- and
(A,S)-units are arranged alternately.
The minimum ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 (≈2.0) is essentially equal
to that (≈2.0) of the above synchronous model of pR = portho = 0.5 and located at the origin, pmeso = pH−Τ = 0.0, where either (O,R)- and
(A,S)-units or (A,R)- and (O,S)-units
are arranged alternately (the synchronous inversions).

Characteristics of the Polycarbonate Chains
It is known
that PEO crystallizes in the tgt conformation.44 As our MO calculations indicate, PEC is also most stabilized
in this conformation. Nevertheless, PEC is an amorphous polymer. Figure 6a shows the charge
distribution of E_model whose O–CH2–CH2–O bonds lie in the tgt state. The carbonate group
with three oxygen atoms draws electrons, and the negative charge appears
to be distributed helically on the molecular surface. Accordingly,
the PEC chains repel each other and fail to form a regular packing.
This may be an origin of its amorphous nature. In addition, as shown
above, PEC and PPC strongly prefer distorted conformations including
a number of gauche bonds. This is also an origin.

For liquid
crystalline polycarbonates, the geometrical characters of the carbonate
linkage were revealed.45 The O–C(=O)–O
group lies on a plane, and the O–C–O and C(=O)–O–C
angles were determined to be 108° and 118.3°, respectively;
therefore, the mesogenic cores can scarcely be arranged in parallel
with each other, and hence this structural distortion affects the
stability of the liquid crystalline phase. The present study has evaluated
bond angles of bonds a and b of PEC and PPC to be 107.9° and
115.5°, respectively (Table 8). In these two polycarbonates, therefore, the linearity
of the chain backbone would be unattainable even though they were
in the all-trans form. This may also be a reason for their amorphous
nature.

Inasmuch as amorphous PEC and PPC chains lie in near
unperturbed
states, the refined RIS calculations can provide reliable insights
into their solid-state properties as well as solution (melt) properties.
Because of the distorted conformations, PEC and PPC exhibit the characteristic
ratios smaller than those of common linear polymers. The RIS calculations
with the Markov chain showed that the characteristic ratio of PPC
does not depend significantly on the regio- and stereoregularities.
The reason may be explained as follows. The carbonate group separates
the neighboring rotatable O–CH2–CH(CH3)–O parts with two rigid O–C(=O)–O
bonds; therefore, the conformational correlations can be only weakly
transmitted to the adjacent monomeric unit, and hence the individual
units are allowed to change the conformation nearly independently
of the neighbors. As far as PPC is concerned, the regio- and stereoregularities
have no significant effects on the spatial configuration and probably
on the other physical properties.

Mechanical Properties
Flory et al. thermodynamically
revealed the requirement for rubberlike elasticity of polymers.46−51 On this basis, we can discuss whether amorphous PEC and PPC will
exhibit rubberlike chain elasticity.

The tension (f) of an elastomer is composed of two terms due to internal-energy
(U) and entropy (S) changes46 4  where 5  and 6  with T, V, and L being the absolute temperature, volume,
and length, respectively. The fU/f ratio is expressed as a function of the
temperature coefficient of the mean square end-to-end distance by47−50 7  Although intermolecular interactions occur
in rubberlike materials, these interactions have been assumed to be
independent of the configurations of the network chains. In other
words, it is well-established that rubberlike elasticity is principally
of intramolecular origin.48,50,52 Therefore, we are allowed to discuss the possibility that the two
polycarbonates will act as elastomers, on the basis of eq 7, which can be evaluated from the
refined RIS calculations.

The fU/f ratios of PEC and isotactic PPC
of 100% H–T linkage at 25
°C were evaluated from the dln⟨r2⟩0/dT values (in Table 8). The PEC chain has
a positive value of 0.095 in the gas phase but negatives of −0.035
to −0.080 in the solvents, whereas PPC always shows positive
values (0.32–0.052). For both polycarbonates, the fU/f ratio tends to decrease
with increasing medium polarity. The sign of fU/f can be related to conformational
changes during chain deformation as follows.

It is known that
polyethylene shows negative fU/f values of ca. −0.4.47,49,50 Its CH2–CH2 bond prefers the trans conformation, and the trans-gauche
energy difference is 0.4–0.5 kcal mol–1.35,53 As temperature increases (ΔT > 0), the
trans
conformations partly change to distorted gauche states of higher energy,
and hence the chain dimension decreases (Δ⟨r2⟩0 < 0, ΔL < 0, and ΔU > 0), accordingly, dln⟨r2⟩0/dT <
0, ΔU/ΔL ≈ (∂U/∂L) < 0, and fU/f < 0. The negative fU/f works
against the entropic elasticity because the fS term must always be positive.

The
PPC chain gives positive fU/f values. This is because, in contrast to
polyethylene, PPC by nature chooses distorted conformations such as
g+g+t, g+g–g–, tg+t, tg–g–, and tg–t. As the temperature is increased, the
distortion is released by the gauche-to-trans change, and hence, the
chain is extended: dln⟨r2⟩0/dT > 0. The stretching (contraction)
of
the PPC chain increases (decreases) the internal energy: (∂U/∂L) > 0, therefore, fU/f > 0.
The conformational
characteristic of PPC supports its entropic elasticity. On the other
hand, PEC changes the sign of fU/f, depending on the surroundings. It is well-known
that elastomers give positive fU/f values: cis-1,4-polybutadiene
(0.10–0.17), polydimethylsiloxane (0.13–0.30), and natural
rubber (0.12–0.18).50 Therefore,
the PPC chain may be more likely than PEC to behave as an elastomer.

The fU/f ratios of PPC were calculated according to the Markov model as a
function of pH–T and pmeso. In Figure 8b, the data are also plotted as a two-dimensional
contour map. The maximum fU/f value (0.311) is found at the origin (pH–T = pmeso = 0), where the minimum characteristic ratio
was predicted above, and the PPC chain is a perfect alternating copolymer
of either (O,R)- and (A,S)-monomers or (O,S)- and (A,R)-monomers. The minimum fU/f (0.075)
is indicated to be located at the left top corner (pH–T = 0 and pmeso = 1), where the maximum ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 was suggested,
and the PPC chain is an alternating copolymer of either (O,R)- and (A,R)-units
or (O,S)- and (A,S)-units. These facts suggest an inverse correlation
between fU/f and ⟨r2⟩0/nl2, that is, between the rubberlike elasticity
and the chain dimension.

It has been reported that PEC with
a low Tg of ca. 10 °C behaves as
an elastomer at room temperature
with an elongation at break greater than 600% and completely recovers
to the initial length after removal of the load.54 On the other hand, mechanical properties of PPC are more
complicated owing to its higher Tg of
35–42 °C. Although PPC is brittle below 20 °C, an
effective plasticizer (10 wt % of 1,6-bis(methyl urethane)hexane)
was found to reduce Tg of PPC significantly
and improve the mechanical properties: elongation at break, ca. 700%
and tensile strength, 30 MPa.55 In addition,
PPC was mixed with rubbery polyurethane particles (30 wt %) to show
an impact strength of as much as 228.3 J m–1.56 When amorphous PPC was blended and fixed by
graft polymerization with poly(β-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) (PHBV/PPC = 30:70 in weight), the composite
materials exhibited a marked elongation at break of 1300%.57 In addition, block copolymers of PPC with poly(ethylene
glycol), having weight-average molecular weights of 81 000
and 225 000, were shown to be stretchable up to 870 and 720%,
respectively, even though the PPC alone was so brittle as to be broken
at only a 7% extension.58 Accordingly,
effective processing such as copolymerization, cross-linking, blending,
and plasticizing for PEC and PPC will reveal their potential mechanical
properties.

On Applications of PEC and PPC
Another
expectable utilization
of PEC and PPC is ion-conductive polymer electrolytes. As a representative
polymer for this purpose, we can mention PEO. It is known that PEO
is capable of changing the conformational preference according to
the environment.29,30,59 In the gas phase or nonpolar media, the energy difference between
ttt and tgt states in the O–CH2–CH2–O bonds is close to null. In polar solvents, however, the
tgt conformation will be more stable than ttt by over 1.0 kcal mol–1. As found for crown ethers,60 the PEO chain adopts the tgt conformation and captures a cation
such as alkali metal ions. Inasmuch as PEO is semicrystalline, the
cations will be trapped only in the amorphous phase and on the crystallite
surface. The ionic conductivity of PEO is reported to be on the order
of 10–8 to 10–7 S cm–1.61

The present study has shown
that the tg+t and tg+g+ conformations
of PEC are more stable in ΔGk than those of PEO. Therefore, the O–CH2–CH2–O bond sequence as well as the electronegative carbonate
group (see Figure 6a) can readily capture, for example, Li+ ion. In addition,
PEC and PPC are completely amorphous, and hence most monomeric units
are ready to accept Li+ ions. Compared with PEO, therefore,
PEC can interact with much more inorganic salts, and its ionic conductivity
is as high as ∼10–4 S cm–1.61,62 As can be seen from Table 6, stable conformations in the O–CH2–C*H(CH3)–O bond sequence of P_model
are tg+t, g+g+t, tg–g–, and g+g–g–, and hence amorphous PPC can also capture Li+ ion effectually. For a PPC/Li6.76La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 composite, the following
electric characteristics have been reported: ionic conductivity, 5.2
× 10–4 S cm–1; electrochemical
window, 4.6 V; and ionic transference number, 0.75.63 The green polymers produced from carbon dioxide would be
future ion-conductive electrolytes to illuminate the world.

Conclusions
Conformational characteristics and configurational properties of
PEC and PPC have been elucidated by the methodology based on MO calculations,
NMR experiments, and RIS calculations. Both PEC and PPC were found
to strongly prefer distorted conformations including a number of gauche
states. In the RIS calculations on PPC, the Bernoulli and Markov stochastic
processes were employed to generate its regio- and stereosequences,
and its configurational properties were shown not to depend significantly
on the regio- and stereosequences. The physical properties, practical
uses, and potential applications of the two polycarbonates have been
discussed in terms of the structural information thus obtained. In
conclusion, as a result of the detailed computational characterization,
it is preferable that PEC and PPC should be prepared at low costs
so as to give high yields without paying particular attention to the
regio- and stereoregularities, processed so as to lower the glass
transition temperatures, and used as high-value added flexible functional
materials.

Methods
Synthesis of Model Compounds
Methyl
chloroformate (9.7
mL, 0.125 mol), dissolved in chloroform (12.5 mL), was added dropwise
under argon atmosphere to ethylene glycol (2.8 mL, 0.05 mol) and pyridine
(20 mL), and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 3 h and then
at room temperature overnight.64 The reaction
mixture was acidified to pH = 2 with hydrochloric acid (20 mL) and
underwent extraction twice with chloroform (15 mL × 2). The organic
layer was washed thrice with saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate
(30 mL × 3) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (ca. 10 g)
overnight. The solution was filtrated and condensed on a rotary evaporator.
The residue was dried in vacuo at 35 °C for 3 h to yield ethylene
glycol bis(methyl carbonate) (E_model) (yield, 86%).

Propylene
glycol bis(methyl carbonate) (P_model) was synthesized similarly except
that propylene glycol was used instead of ethylene glycol. The yield
was 50%.

NMR Measurements
Proton NMR spectra were recorded at
500 MHz on a JEOL JNM-ECA500 spectrometer in the Center for Analytical
Instrumentation of Chiba University. The sample temperature was increased
stepwise from 15 or 25 °C to 45 or 55 °C at intervals of
10 °C. Free induction decays (FIDs) were accumulated under the
following conditions: scan, 32–128; 45° pulse width, 5.7
μs; acquisition time, 4.4 s; and recycle delay, 4 s. The FID
was fully zero-filled prior to the Fourier transform to yield enough
digital resolution in Hz for the subsequent analysis. The NMR solvents
were chloroform-d, acetone-d6, methanol-d4, and dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), and 5 mm NMR sample tubes were used. The obtained spectra were
simulated with the gNMR program65 to yield 1H chemical shifts and 1H–1H coupling
constants.

NMR Analysis
Vicinal 1H–1H coupling constants (JHH and J′HH)
observed from the methylene
protons, A, A′, B, and B′ of E_model (see Figures 4 and 9) can be expressed as weight averages of JT’s and JG’s 8  and 9  where the weights, pt and pg, are trans and gauche
fractions of the CH2–CH2 bond, respectively.
By definition, we have 10  where pg+ = pg– = pg/2.

Figure 9 Rotamers around
bonds (a) 4 of E_model and P_model, (b) 5 of E_model,
(c) 5 of (R)-P_model, and (d) 6 of E_ (R = H) and (R)-P_ (R = CH3) models. For the bond numbers, see Figure 4. The vicinal JT and JG couplings used in eqs 8, 9, 11, and 12 are defined as illustrated.

There is the possibility that
P_model is either (R)- or (S)-isomer,
but both give the identical NMR
spectra. Therefore, although we employed its racemic mixture in NMR
measurements, we are allowed to analyze the observed spectra with
either isomeric model. Herein, the (R)-P_model is
used throughout. Vicinal coupling constants between the methylene
(A or B) and methine (C) protons are expressed as 11  and 12  For JT’s
and JG’s, see Figure 9. The trans, gauche+, and gauche– fractions fulfill 13  It should be noted that
the gauche+ and gauche– states are not
equivalent: pg+ ≠ pg–. Substitution of the observed J values into the above equations yields pt and pg of E_model or pt, pg+, and pg– of P_model,
if the JT and JG values are given beforehand. This study has adopted two sets of JT and JG: set A, JT’s = 9.87 and JG’s = 2.54 Hz for the chloroform solution and JT’s = 10.25 and JG’s = 2.52 Hz for the acetone, methanol, and DMSO solutions
(taken from those of cis-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane66); set B, JT’s
= 11.4 and JG’s = 2.3 Hz (optimized
for 1,2-dimethoxyethane28).

Molecular Orbital
Calculations
MO calculations on the
model compounds were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program67 installed on an HPC Systems 5000-Z800 computer.
For each conformer, the molecular geometry was fully optimized at
the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level under the tight convergence, and thermochemical
energies at 25 °C and 1 atm were also computed by the frequency
calculation at the same level. Furthermore, the electronic energy
was calculated at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,p) level for the optimized geometry.
The conformer free energy was obtained from the MP2 electronic energy
and the B3LYP thermochemical correction term to the Gibbs free energy,
being expressed as the difference (ΔGk, k: conformer) from that of the
all-trans conformation. The solvent effect on the MP2 electronic energy
was evaluated by the polarizable continuum model using the integral
equation formalism variant.68

Rotational
Isomeric State Calculation
The refined RIS
scheme23,35,69 was applied
to PEC and PPC. The refined RIS scheme has been developed
so as to change both conformational energy and geometrical parameters
with conformations of the neighboring as well as current bonds to
yield accurate results. The statistical weight matrices of PEC and
PPC were formulated on the basis of the chemical structures shown
in Figure 1 and as
presented in Appendices A and B (Supporting Information). The geometrical parameters of PEC and PPC were chosen from the
optimized structures of E_model and P_model, respectively, being tabulated
in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information).

Conventionally, the C*H(CH3) and CH2 parts of PPC have been termed head and tail, respectively. Herein, the CH2 →
C*H(CH3) (tail → head) and C*H(CH3) →
CH2 (head → tail) directions are designated as orthodromic
(O) and antidromic (A), respectively
(see Figure 3). However,
this definition is not absolute: if the (O)-isomer
is turned around 180° with respect to a line perpendicular to
the chain axis, it becomes the (A)-isomer. Nevertheless,
the RIS scheme requires us to determine the moving direction for the
matrix multiplication. For example, when the monomer (propylene oxide
+ carbonate) has the O direction and (R)-chiral center, it is represented herein as (O,R)-monomer. The OO, OA, AA, and AO combinations between monomers
form H–T, H–H, T–H, and T–T linkages,
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3. Inasmuch as the H–T and T–H linkages
are identical, the regiosequences expressed in the O and A manner can be rewritten in terms of H–T,
H–H, and T–T.

If we obtain conformer free energies
of (O,R)-monomer of PPC and formulate
its statistical weight matrices Uj’s (j: bond number), we can derive Uj’s of (O,S)-, and
(A,R)-, and (A,S)-monomers by proper matrix operations as shown in Appendix
B (Supporting Information). From the optimized
geometrical parameters of (O,R)-monomer
(Table S2, Supporting Information), we
can also derive those of the other three isomers.

To arrange
the stereo- and regiosequences of the PPC chain, we
have adopted two stochastic processes: the Bernoulli trial and the
first-order Markov chain.24,25 In the Bernoulli trial,
a random number was generated between zero and unity. When the number
was smaller than or equal to the given pR value, the next repeating unit was (R)-isomer. Otherwise, (S)-isomer was selected. Here, pR represents the (R)-isomeric probability. The regiosequences were determined similarly
with the O probability (portho) instead of pR. The
operation was repeated up to a given degree (x) of
polymerization over a given number (nc) of chains. Fractions of the regio- (H–T, H–H, and
T–T) and stereosequences (diad, meso, and racemo; triad, mm, mr, rm, and rr) were calculated as a function
of pR and portho, according to the Bernoulli trial as given in Table
S3 (Supporting Information).

In the
Markov process, a random number was generated within the
range of zero to unity. When the value was smaller or equal to pmeso (or pH–T), the same optical isomer (direction) as that
of the preceding monomer was added. Otherwise, the other isomer (orientation)
was added. Here, pmeso and pH–T are probabilities of meso diad and H–T linkage, respectively. This operation
was repeated x × nc times as above. Fractions of the regio- and stereosequences based
on the Markov chain are also listed in Table S3 (Supporting Information).

In accordance with the stereo-
and regiosequences of the PPC chains
thus generated, the super generator matrices Hβα’s
(α = R or S and β = O or A)23 were
chosen, arranged, and multiplied sequentially to yield the configurational
properties and thermodynamic quantities for the individual chains.
The final outcomes were the averages over all of the nc chains. In our previous study on poly(lactide)s,70 fluctuations in data resulting from the stochastic
processes were found to decrease with increasing number (x × nc) of trials. When x = nc = 300, the accuracy and reproducibility
were fully satisfactory. Therefore, this study has generally employed x = nc = 300, except when the
data on the infinite chain (x = ∞) were determined
from the extrapolation of the datum versus x–1 plot. Then, the x and nc values were set as 100 ≤ x ≤
300 and nc = 300.
