18F-Labeled building blocks from the type of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters offer
a rapid, mild, and reliable method for the 18F-fluoroarylation
of biomolecules. Two series of azocarboxamides were synthesized as
potential radioligands for dopamine D3 and the μ-opioid receptor,
revealing compounds 3d and 3e with single-digit
and sub-nanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and compound 4c with only micromolar affinity for the μ-opioid receptor,
but enhanced selectivity for the μ-subtype in comparison to
the lead compound AH-7921. A “minimalist procedure”
without the use of a cryptand and base for the preparation of 4-[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2a was established,
together with the radiosynthesis of methyl-, methoxy-, and phenyl-substituted
derivatives ([18F]2b–f). With the substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarbylates
in hand, two prototype azocarboxylates radioligands were synthesized
by 18F-fluoroarylation, namely the methoxy azocarboxamide [18F]3d as the D3 receptor
radioligand and [18F]4a as a prototype structure of the μ-opioid receptor radioligand.
By introducing the new series of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters, the method of 18F-fluoroarylation
was significantly expanded, thereby demonstrating the versatility
of 18F-labeled phenylazocarboxylates for the design of
potential radiotracers for positron emission tomography .

Introduction
Positron emission tomography
(PET) has emerged as a powerful and
highly sensitive imaging technique for the diagnosis and monitoring
of treatment of diseases in routine nuclear medicine and in preclinical
radiopharmaceutical sciences. The most frequently used positron-emitting
radioisotope is fluorine-18 because of its favorable physical properties
and a chemistry-compatible half-life of 110 min. Offering a wide range
of compounds that are amenable to 18F-labeling would be
essential for broadening the scope of PET in future applications.1 Therefore, highly effective radiochemical labeling
methods for the introduction of fluorine-18 into molecules are needed.

The aromatic noncarrier-added (n.c.a.) 18F-nucleophilic
substitutions are demanding and feasible only if activated aromatic
systems are employed. Electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro,
cyano, aldehyde, or carboxylic functions in the ortho or para position
to the leaving group increase the reactivity toward nucleophilic aromatic 18F-fluorination.2−4 Onium salts, nitro, or halides
are typical leaving groups, and moreover, significant advances have
been made in broadening the scope of nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination
using triarylsulfonium,5,6 iodonium ylide precursors,7,8 and transition-metal-mediated fluorination.9−12 In addition, the use of aromatic
boronic acids13 or aryl stannane precursors14,15 or methods for the in situ formation of iodonium salts of electron-rich
arenes16 that allow the effective Cu-mediated
direct 18F-fluorination obtaining the 18F-labeled
target compound in a single reaction step has been reported recently.
However, especially large molecules, oligo-nuclides, and peptides
are frequently not amenable to fluorination through direct nucleophilic
substitution because of the harsh reaction conditions that lead to
the formation of side products or when reactive functional groups
such as free amino-, carboxylic acid-, or other CH-acidic-functionalities
are present.17

In the past, 18F-fluoroarylation required harsh reaction
conditions and laborious processing, which led to low radiochemical
yields (RCYs) of the product.18,19 The procedure described
by Höfling et al. demonstrated a first attempt to improve the
RCY employing the radical 18F-fluoroarylation by the use
of 18F-labeled arenediazonium chloride for the example
of a potential D3 radioligand of the cinnamoyl amide type.20 Recently, we have developed an efficient strategy
for the 18F-fluoroarylation of biomolecules by the use
of 4-[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2a, which is obtained by fluorination of trimethylammonium triflate
precursor 1 with fluorine-18 in only 30 s in acetonitrile
at 85 °C in nearly quantitative yields.21,22 The discovery of [18F]2a-enabling efficient 18F-fluoroarylation offered structurally
very similar azocarboxamide D3 radioligands, such as [18F]3a (Figure 1A), obtainable in only two steps under far
more convenient reaction conditions (see Scheme 1).21 After separating 1 from the 18F-labeled building block [18F]2a by simple solid-phase
extraction, the 18F-fluoroarylation reaction could be performed
with a primary amine at room temperature (rt) in ethanol (Scheme 1).21,22 A further exceptional advantage of [18F]2a is its capability to selectively undergo
different types of reaction pathways besides nucleophilic substitution,
such as radical reactions, benzylation, and allylation in a Barbier-type
reaction as well as cycloadditions.21,23−26

Scheme 1 General Scheme for the Radiosyntheses of [18F]Fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl Esters [18F]2a–f and the 18F-Fluoroarylation
of Amines to Afford New 18F-Labeled Ligands of the Azocarboxamide
Type
The azocarboxamide [18F]3a belongs to the class
of phenylpiperazinyl benzamides
as D3 subtype selective ligands (Figure 1A).27,28 Several efforts have
been made to develop a subtype selective D3 PET ligand for in vivo
use, however, a suitable radioligand is still missing.29 In our previous work, we conducted detailed
in vitro and in vivo studies with PET ligands from the azocarboxamide
type of compounds,30−33 demonstrating that [18F]3a was suitable for the selective detection of the dopamine
D3 receptor distribution in vitro in the rat brain, but failed to
image the dopamine D3 receptor in vivo by PET-imaging studies.21,34 In addition, the modifications of the substitution pattern of the
phenyl moiety at the piperazine ring of [18F]3a or the addition of a hydroxyl function at
the butyl linker to reduce lipophilicity have been made but did not
lead to any major improvement in the D3 selectivity profile or the
biodistribution of the respective D3 radioligand.34,35

Therefore, substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters could offer the possibility of studying
the effects on D3 receptor selectivity and affinity that variations
on the aromatic moiety of the azo unit have. Moreover, [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters could
also be useful to obtain a series of potential μ-opioid receptor-selective
radioligands based on the structure of AH-7921 (Figure 1A).36−38

The aim of this study was
to further explore and improve the advantages
of using[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters for 18F-fluoroarylation reactions. First,
we aimed at improving the overall RCY of 18F-fluoroarylation
with [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester through applying and optimizing the so-called “minimalist
procedure”39 that makes use of ammonium
triflate precursors, such as 1 (Scheme 1) that are able to elute [18F]fluoride
from an anion-exchange cartridge, thereby shortening the reaction
time of the 18F-synthesis in an automated process significantly.
Second, we aimed at enhancing the diversity of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters as 18F-labeled building blocks
by additional substitution of the phenyl ring in the ortho and meta
position to fluorine (Scheme 1 and Figure 2D). Third, we demonstrated 18F-fluoroarylation using unsubstituted
[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl
ester [18F]2a achieved
by the “minimalist procedure” for the radiosynthesis
of azocarboxamide [18F]4a as a potential μ-opioid receptor radioligand (Figure 1B), and we successfully applied
the methoxy-substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2d to the radiosynthesis of the D3 radioligand candidate [18F]3d (Figure 1B). Both 18F-labeled
compounds are interesting PET tracers for future in vivo characterization
by small animal PET.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis of precursor compounds 1a–f for
radiolabeling and 19F-fluorinated reference compounds 2a–f, 3a–e, and 4a–e started either from commercially available 4-fluoronitrobenzenes
and 4-fluoroanilines or, if available, from the respective arylhydrazines
(Scheme 2). As 4-fluoro-
and 4-nitrophenylhydrazine were the only commercially available arylhydrazines,
only phenylazocarboxylates 1a and 2a could
be prepared via a short two-step sequence including treatment of the
4-fluoro- or 4-nitrophenylhydrazine with di-tert-butyl
dicarbonate, followed by oxidation with manganese dioxide [Scheme 2, conditions (c)
and (d)]. In this way, 1a and 2a were prepared
in yields of 73% (1a) and 94% (2a) (over
two steps), which is consistent with the previously reported data.21,25,26 The synthesis of nitro-substituted
azocarboxylates 1b–f required previous preparation
of the corresponding 4-nitrophenylhydrazines through nucleophilic
substitution of suitably substituted 4-fluoronitro-benzenes by hydrazine
[Scheme 2, condition
(a)], so that three synthetic steps were necessary in total [Scheme 2, conditions (a),
(d), and (e)]. Fluoro-substituted phenylazocarboxylates 2b–f were prepared from the respective 4-fluoroanilines over four steps
[Scheme 2, conditions
(b), (c), (d), and (e)] and were obtained in lower overall yields
of 10–30%, whereas the particular low yield for 2f did not permit further conversion of this compound to ligands of
types 3 and 4.

h. If no reaction time is given, the consumption of reactants was
monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).

Starting from azocarboxylates 2a–e, 4-fluorophenylazocarboxamides 3b–e and 4a–e were synthesized.
These syntheses were performed through nucleophilic substitution at
the carbonyl moieties of 2a–e mediated by Cs2CO3 as the base and using ethanol as the solvent.
The potential dopamine D3 receptor ligands 3b–e were obtained through a reaction with the primary amine 4-amino-1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)butane
in yields of approximately 30%. The potential μ-opioid receptor
ligands 4a–e were provided by the reaction of 2a–e with the primary amine N-[1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexyl]-N,N-dimethylamine in slightly higher yields
of about 40%. The coupling of tert-butyl 4-fluorophenylazocarboxylates
with primary amines under basic conditions has been previously reported21,35 using K2CO3 as the base in the solvent ethyl
acetate, which results in a suspension as the reaction mixture and
thus to a heterogenic reaction. Now, using the reaction conditions
as optimized previously for 18F-radiochemistry,22 applying Cs2CO3 as the
base and ethanol as the solvent, the yields of target compounds 3b–e and 4a–e could be increased
by about 10%.

The receptor-binding studies determined the affinity
of compounds 3b–e to subtypes of the dopamine
receptors and to the
related biogenic amine receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and α1. The binding affinity of 4a–e was investigated toward the δ, κ, and μ-opioid
receptor subtypes (Table 1). The affinity of candidates 3b–e for
binding at the D3 receptor was in the same nanomolar range as for
reference compound 3a (Ki(D3) = 3.5 nM). The selectivity of 3b, c, and d concerning the binding at the other dopamine
subtypes and the related amine receptors was also comparable to reference
compound 3a. An improvement in D3 selectivity over 5-HT1A could be seen for 3b–f in comparison
with 3a as the reference [Ki(5-HT1A/D3) = 1.8], especially for phenyl compound 3e (Ki(5-HT1A/D3) =
43). The selectivity of reference compound 3a (Ki(D2/D3) = 10) has been shown to be sufficient
to selectively address and quantify the D3 receptor in vitro, without
interfering the D2 binding.34 Concerning
the affinity for binding at the D3 receptor, the position
of the substituent in the ortho or meta position to fluorine did not
reveal any major effect on the D3 affinity. One exception is the phenyl
substituent of 3e, leading to an increased D3 affinity
by 10-fold (Ki = 0.4 nM) compared to ortho-
and meta-unsubstituted reference compound 3a.

Opioid receptor candidates 4a–e show more than
10-fold less affinity for binding at the μ-opioid receptor than
the reference compound AH-7921, which exhibits a Ki(μOR) of 0.11 μM. The highest affinity for
binding at the μOR-subtype was determined with methyl-substituted
compound 4c [Ki(μOR)
= 1.1 μM]. Ortho-methoxy compound 4d did not show
any selectivity between the κ and μ opioid receptor subtypes,
similar to 4a, b, d, and e. Interestingly, the subtype selectivity of compound 4c [Ki(κOR/μOR) =
4.4; Ki(δOR/μOR) = 27] was
doubled compared to the reference compound AH-7921 [Ki(κOR/μOR) = 2.4; Ki(δOR/μOR) = 6.8].

As the starting point for the
“minimalist procedure”
according to the Neumaier group,39 the
precursor concentration of 1 of 1.2 mM was used to elute
fluorine-18 from the cartridge (Scheme 3). The recovery value of 100% of fluorine-18 from the
cartridge was defined by comparison with the elution of fluorine-18
from the anion exchange QMA cartridge using cryptate 222 and K2CO3 as the eluent. Under these conditions, an RCY
of 88% for the subsequent labeling of [18F]2a was achieved (Scheme 3), which is in accordance with the literature.21

Scheme 3 Radiosynthesis of [18F]4a by 18F-Fluoroarylation
with [18F]2a Produced
by the Conventional Procedure
and “Minimalist Procedure”
The results of the [18F]fluoride recovery for
the elution
of fluoride-18 by ammonium triflate precursor 1 using
different solvent systems is shown in Figure S1A, demonstrating that acetonitrile is not suitable and that methanol
and ethanol revealed recovery values of around 80% (Figure S1A). The precursor concentration of 1 needed to be raised to 2.4 mM, when the eluent for [18F]fluoride had to be changed to a mixture of ethanol and acetonitrile,
whereby the optimal ratio of the two solvents was determined. It turned
out that a ratio of EtOH/CH3CN = 4:1 was optimal for the
recovery of fluorine-18 of nearly 100% (Figure S1A). The subsequent labeling proceeded after the evaporation
of the solvent system and addition of dry acetonitrile with an RCY
of about 75% after 30 s at 85 °C. These findings were in accordance
with the literature,39 concerning the elution
of [18F]fluoride in alcoholic solvents and the subsequent
necessity of evaporating the solvent and redissolving in appropriate
reaction solvents using a trimethylammonium triflate-bearing precursor.

Further increasing the precursor amount to 5.0 mM offered a slightly
higher RCY of 80% coming close to the 88% RCY, which was achieved
under conventional conditions (Scheme 3). The labeling to yield the versatile prosthetic group [18F]2a is therefore
possible under the conditions of the “minimalist procedure.”
The “minimalist procedure” though requires a higher
precursor amount of twice or thrice the concentration necessary for
the conventional approach to enable labeling with fluorine-18. Precursor 1 is though very easily separated from [18F]2a through solid-phase extraction
(tC18, Waters), and the higher excess of the unreacted precursor did
not influence the subsequent coupling of [18F]2a to give the potential opioid receptor
PET ligand [18F]4a (Scheme 3). The 18F-fluoroarylation with [18F]2a obtained under conventional conditions offered [18F]4a in an RCY of
84 ± 1% (n = 2). [18F]2a obtained under the conditions of the “minimalist
procedure” offered [18F]4a in an RCY of 78 ± 2% (n =
2). The time of evaporation and redissolving step (≈1 min)
is very short compared to azeotropic drying (10–15 min); therefore,
both approaches can be considered reasonable in manual radiosyntheses,
depending on which factor is more crucial, the time advantage or the
precursor amount. However, most importantly, the “minimalist
procedure” could be of exceptional importance for automated
processes in 18F-synthesis modules because of the provided
time benefit.

Besides the optimization of the “minimalist
procedure”
using trimethylammonium triflate precursor 1, we aimed
at the variation of the substitution pattern at the aromatic ring
of [18F]2a. This
could be achieved by using the series of nitro precursors 1a–f that turned out to be more easily accessible than the corresponding
trimethylammonium triflates. The nucleophilic 18F-fluorination
of 1a–f was performed using the conventional 18F-labeling conditions of 1 as a starting point,
as depicted in Scheme 1. To identify the influence of the substitution at the phenyl ring
on the RCY of [18F]2b–f, the RCY of [18F]2a, prepared from nitro precursor 1a, served as a reference
(red color, Figure 2). The RCY of [18F]2a starting from both 1 and 1a was nearly
the same, the labeling of the nitro precursor though required a longer
reaction time of 5 min (Figure 2B).

The results of the 18F-labeling experiments
showed that
it was not possible to radiolabel methyl-substituted precursors 1b and 1c using the concentration of 1.2 mM (Figure 2A). The concentration
was therefore increased to 2.4 mM (Figure 2B), so that [18F]2b and [18F]2c were obtained in a low RCY of 18 and 3%, respectively.
It is tempting to speculate that the low RCY could be ascribed to
the presence of the benzylic proton that reacts with [18F]fluoride to give hydrogen fluoride, thereby reducing the RCY of
the nucleophilic fluorination significantly. The labeling of ortho-
and meta-methoxy substituted compounds 1d and 1f was more successful, when changing the reaction conditions from
classical conditions (37.5 mM K2CO3) to the
so-called “mild” conditions,40 applying K2CO3 and KH2PO4. Applying the precursor concentrations of 1d and 1f of 1.2 mM, an RCY of almost 60% could be achieved for [18F]2d under “mild”
reaction conditions (Figure 2A). An increase of the precursor concentration to 2.4 mM revealed
that the RCY of both [18F]2d and [18F]2f reached 40–50% after 10 min reaction time (Figure 2A,B). The decreased RCY compared
to the unsubstituted azocarboxlyate [18F]2a can be explained by the +M effect of the
methoxy group, increasing the electron density at the aromatic core.
The effect is thereby independent of the position of the methoxy group
because ortho substitution (relative to the nitro group), as in 1f, can destabilize the negatively charged cyclohexadienyl
intermediate resulting from the attack of the 18F-fluoride,
and meta substitution will reduce the electron-withdrawing properties
of the azocarbonyl unit through the formation of a push–pull
system. The activating effect of the azocarbonyl moiety is, however,
crucial for the successful incorporation of 18F-fluoride
into the azocarboxylate. Consequently, the biphenyl compound [18F]2e, in which the
additional phenyl group does not exert a strong electron-donating
effect, was obtained in a higher RCY of up to 60% under mild reaction
conditions (Figure 2B).

Finally, as a proof of concept for the capability of 18F-labeled building blocks [18F]2a–f to react with primary amines of
biological
relevance, the 18F-fluoroarylation step was performed with [18F]2d that was separated
from nitro precursor 1d by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (Figure 3A).
Coupling of [18F]2d to (2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl amine provided the D3 radioligand
candidate [18F]3d in 27% RCY in ethanol in the presence of Cs2CO3 after 5 min at rt (Figure 3B).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the fluorine-substituted azocarboxamide
building
blocks 2a–f were applied to the synthesis of a
series of potential D3 ligands (3a–e) and opioid
ligands (4a–e), from which 3e turned
out to be a highly subtype selective D3 ligand with a subnanomolar
receptor affinity, demonstrating and confirming that the azocarboxamide
substructure is well-tolerated by the D3 receptor. However, in the
case of the series of opioid ligands, the azocarboxamides are far
less potent than the carboxamide reference AH-7921, suggesting that
the azo unit is not well-tolerated by the opioid receptor for the
series of compounds under study.

The preparation of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2a was successfully
optimized by applying the “minimalist
procedure” that is of utmost importance for rapid automated
radiosyntheses of PET tracers. Moreover, applying the nitro precursors 1a–f, the radiochemical synthesis of a series of methyl-,
methoxy-, and phenyl-substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters [18F]2a–f was studied, revealing that the methoxy-
and phenyl-substituted compounds ([18F]2d–f) showed an RCY of 40–60%
in the presence of KH2PO4. Providing evidence
for the applicability of the new series of 18F-labeled
building blocks, the subsequent exemplary labeling of the azocyclohexyl
amide [18F]4a as
an opioid receptor radioligand was successfully accomplished, and
the 18F-labeled D3 radioligand [18F]3d was prepared by 18F-fluoroarylation
with [18F]2d in
27% RCY.

By introducing the new series of substituted 18F-labeled
phenylazocarboxylic esters as 18F-labeled building blocks,
the method of 18F-fluoroarylation was significantly expanded,
thereby demonstrating the versatility of 18F-labeled phenylazocarboxylates
for the design of 18F-labeled biomolecules as radiotracers
for PET.

using electronspray ionization (ESI), and on a Bruker maXis UHR-TOF
system using ESI.

Analytical TLC was carried out on Merck silica
gel plates using short-wave (254 nm) ultraviolet (UV) light, KMnO4 [3.0 g KMnO4, 20 g potassium carbonate, 5.0 mL
aqueous sodium hydroxide (5 w/w %) in 300 mL H2O], and
ninhydrine (200 mg ninhydrine in 100 mL ethanol) to visualize the
components. For column chromatography, silica gel (silica gel 60,
grain size 40–63 μm, Merck) was used. All reactions were
carried out following common organic chemistry laboratory procedures.
Special emphasis was on anhydrous solvents for 18F-radiosyntheses.

The identity and purity of compounds was ensured with NMR spectroscopy.
The purity of 1a–f was additionally confirmed
with HPLC method 2. The identity of compounds 3b–e and 4a–e was additionally confirmed with high-resolution
mass spectra. The purity of compounds 3b–e and 4a–e (1 mg/mL) was additionally confirmed by two different
HPLC methods (method 1 or 2 and method 3). The HPLC system (Series
1100, Agilent) was equipped with a VWD UV-lamp (detection at λ
= 214 and λ = 254 nm), and for radiochemistry, it was additionally
connected to a radio detector (500 TR Series, Packard). The conditions
used for analytical HPLC are described in methods 1–3. Method
1: Chromolith RP-18e, 100 × 4.6 mm, flow rate: 4 mL/min, solvent
A: water [0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)], solvent B: acetonitrile
(0.1% TFA), gradient A/B: 90:10 to 50:50 in 5 min, λ = 214 nm.

A: water (0.1% TFA), solvent B: acetonitrile (0.1% TFA), gradient
A/B: 90:10 to 100% B in 5 min, λ = 214 nm.

Fluorine-18
was provided by Advanced Accelerator Applications Germany
GmbH (Erlangen, Germany) and delivered as n.c.a. [18F]fluoride
in solution with an average activity range of 0.6–1.0 GBq.
The identity of radioligands was determined using the reference compounds
bearing the natural fluorine isotope. The reference compound was coinjected
with the radioligand for the HPLC analysis, and the identity was confirmed
by overlapping the retention times using HPLC methods 1 or 2 and 3.
When using radio-TLC (silica gel 60, F254, Merck) to determine
the RCY, the Rf-value of the reference
compounds was used as identification.

General Procedure and Analytical
Data for the Preparation of
Substituted tert-Butyl Phenylazocarboxylates 1a–f and 2a–f
The syntheses
of 4-nitro- and 4-fluorophenylazocarboxylates 1a and 2a were carried out as previously described.25

Preparation of Substituted 4-Nitrophenylhydrazines from 4-Fluoronitrobenzenes
for the Synthesis of 1b–f
A solution
of fluoronitrobenzene (13.8 mmol) and hydrazine hydrate (69.0 mmol,
5.58 g) in ethanol (20 mL) was heated under reflux for 6 h. After
cooling to rt, the precipitated solid was collected by filtration,
and the filter cake was washed with cold ethanol. Drying under reduced
pressure provided crude 4-nitrophenylhydrazine, which was used for
the next step without further purification.

Preparation of Substituted
4-Fluorophenylhydrazines from 4-Fluoroanilines
for the Synthesis of 2b–f
A solution
of the substituted 4-fluoroaniline (10.0 mmol) in glacial acetic acid
(5.0 mL) was treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid (25 mL) and
cooled to 0 °C. A solution of sodium nitrite (10.0 mmol, 690
mg) in water (2.0 mL) was added over a period of 20 min, and the reaction
was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. A precooled solution of tin chloride
dihydrate (22.2 mmol, 5.00 g) in concentrated hydrochloric acid (5.0
mL) was added dropwise over a period of 45 min. After stirring for
1 h at 0 °C, the precipitate was collected by filtration and
was subsequently treated with sodium hydroxide solution (0.05 M).
The resulting mixture was extracted with diethyl ether. The combined
organic phases were washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium
chloride and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent under
reduced pressure provided 4-fluorophenylhydrazine, which was used
for the next step without further purification.

Preparation
of the Phenylazocarboxylates 1b–f and 2b–f from the Corresponding 4-Nitro- and
4-Fluorophenylhydrazines25
The
crude phenylhydrazine (ca. 1 mmol; for preparation, see above) was
dissolved in dry acetonitrile (15 mL) and treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.50 mmol, 327 mg) under an argon
atmosphere. After the mixture was stirred at an ambient temperature
overnight, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude
mixture was then redissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), and manganese
dioxide (5.40 mmol, 469 mg) was added under an argon atmosphere. After
the complete consumption of the reactant, as monitored by TLC (n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 5:1), the mixture was filtered
over celite. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure,
and the obtained residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica
gel, hexane/ethyl acetate = 5:1) to give compounds 1b–f and 2b–f in overall yields of 10–30%
as light to dark orange solids.

General Procedure for the
Preparation of Azocarboxamides 3b–3e and 4a–4e
Under
an argon atmosphere, a solution of 2a–e (0.55
mmol) in EtOH (3 mL) was stirred together with Cs2CO3 (40 mg, 0.13 mmol), and commercially available 4-amino-1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)butane
(0.5 mmol; for the syntheses of 3b–e) or N-[1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexyl]-N,N-dimethylamine (0.5 mmol; for the syntheses of 4a–e) was added. The mixture was stirred at 40 °C overnight. Afterward,
the mixture was diluted with H2O, and the product was extracted
with EtOAc. The combined organic phases were washed with a saturated
saline solution and dried over Na2SO4, and the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was
first purified by column chromatography (MeOH/CH2Cl2 1:9, Rf: = 0.5–0.7) and
then by semipreparative HPLC [Luna C18(2) 5 μm, 250 × 10
mm, flow rate: 4 mL/min., solvent A: water 0.1% TFA, solvent B: acetonitrile
0.1% TFA, gradient A/B: 70:30 to 40:60 in 25 min], λ = 254 nm.
Method 3, tR = 15.00–19.00 min
to give compounds 3b–e and 4a–e after lyophilization of the product fraction as orange to red solids
in yields of 30–40%.

Radiolabeling of Differently
Substituted Phenylazocarboxylic-tert-Butyl Esters
Using Basic and “Mild” Reaction
Conditions by 18F-for-Nitro Nucleophilic Substitution ([18F]2a–f)
Fluorine-18 in target water was diluted with water to 10–20
mL. Thereafter, portions of 1 mL (50–200 MBq) were fixed on
QMA cartrigdes (carbonate form, 46 mg, Waters) and eluted either with
a solution of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (15 mg, 39.8 μmol) and K2CO3 (1.0 M, 15 μL) in CH3CN (900 μL)
or with Kryptofix 2.2.2 (10 mg, 26.5 μmol), K2CO3 (0.1 M, 17.5 μL), and KH2PO4 (0.1
M, 17.5 μL) in CH3CN (900 μL) and water (165
μL). The water was removed by evaporation of CH3CN
(3 × 500 μL) under a stream of nitrogen at 85 °C.
The respective precursors 1a–e (1.2 or 2.4 mM)
dissolved in 500 μL of CH3CN were added to the dried
K+/Kryptofix 2.2.2/18F complex, and the solution
was stirred at 85 °C in CH3CN. Aliquots (20 μL)
were drawn from the reactor after 0.5, 2, and 5 min and quenched in
CH3CN/H2O (0.1% TFA) 1:1 (500 μL). The
RCY was determined by radio-TLC (hexane/EtOAc = 5:1, Rf ([18F]2a–f) = 0.4–0.6). The experiments were performed in duplicate
or triplicate.

2-(4-[18F]Fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine1-yl)but-1-yl)azocarboxamide [18F]3d
[18F]Fluoride was eluted from the QMA cartridge with a solution
of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (10 mg, 26.5 μmol), K2CO3 (0.1 M, 17.5 μL), and KH2PO4 (0.1 M,
17.5 μL) in CH3CN (900 μL) and water (165 μL).
The water was removed by evaporation of CH3CN (3 ×
500 μL) under a stream of nitrogen at 85 °C. Precursor 1d (1.2 mM) dissolved in 500 μL of CH3CN
was added to the dried K+/Kryptofix 2.2.2/18F complex, and the solution was stirred at 85 °C for 10 min.
Afterward, the solution was diluted with water (0.1% TFA, 1 mL) and
subjected to semipreparative HPLC [Luna(C18), 250 × 8 mm, flow
rate: 4 mL/min, solvent: A: H2O (0.1% TFA), solvent B:
CH3CN (0.1% TFA), isocrat. A/B: 70:30, tR([18F]2d) = 10.0 min; tR(1d) = 10.5
min] in three portions of 500 μL to achieve the purification
of [18F]2d. The
intermediate [18F]2d was isolated from the product fraction by solid-phase extraction
on a cartridge (Sep Pak C18, Waters), from where it was then eluted
with ethanol (1 mL) into a reaction vial containing 4-amino-1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)butane
(15 mg, 54 μmol) and Cs2CO3 (7.5 mg, 23
μmol). After the solution was stirred for 5 min at an ambient
temperature, the RCY was determined by radio-TLC from a sample withdrawn
from the reaction mixture.

(E)-N-((1-(Dimethylamino)cyclohexyl)methyl)-2-(4-[18F]fluorophenyl)diazene-1-carboxamide [18F]4a
The radiosynthesis of [18F]4a was performed
through 18F-fluoroarylation with [18F]2a, which was obtained from the labeling
of 1 with fluorine-18 under the conventional procedure
as described previously21 and under the
conditions of the “minimalist procedure” (see the Supporting Information). tert-Butyl 2-(4-[18F]fluorophenyl)azocarboxylate [18F]2a was eluted with EtOH
(1 mL) from the cartridge (tC18, Waters) into a reactor containing
commercially available N-[1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexyl]-N,N-dimethylamine (10 mg, 54 μmol)
and Cs2CO3 (7.5 mg, 23 μmol). After the
solution was stirred for 5 min at rt, an aliquot (20 μL) was
drawn from the reactor and quenched in CH3CN/H2O (0.1% TFA) 1:1 (500 μL), and the RCY was determined with
radio-TLC and double-checked with HPLC (method 1). The identity of
the title compound was confirmed through coinjection with reference
compound 4a using HPLC methods 1 and 2. The 18F-fluoroarylation was performed in duplicates each for [18F]2a produced under conventional
procedure and “minimalist procedure” (see the Supporting Information).

Receptor-Binding
Studies
Affinities of the test compounds
toward human D1R, D2LR, D2SR, D3R, D4R, D5R, 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR, and α1A-AR as well as the human opioid
receptors δOR, κOR, and μOR were determined as described
previously.41 In brief, membranes containing
human D2LR, D2SR, D3R, or D4R obtained from CHO cells stably expressing the corresponding receptors
were used together with the radioligand [3H]spiperone (specific
activity of 73 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, Rodgau, Germany) at a final concentration
of 0.20 nM for D2LR, D2SR, and D3R, and 0.30 nM for D4R. The parameters for the homogenates
were KD 0.10 nM, Bmax 1500 fmol/mg, protein concentration 4 μg/test tube
for D2LR, KD 0.050 nM, Bmax 2000 fmol/mg, protein concentration 2 μg/test
tube for D2SR, KD 0.060 nM, Bmax 1800 fmol/mg, protein concentration 4 μg/test
tube for D3R, and KD 0.30 nM, Bmax 750 fmol/mg, protein concentration 10 μg/test
tube for D4R. Competition-binding experiments with human
D1R, D5R, 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR, and α1A-AR as well as δOR, κOR, and
μOR were performed in an analogous manner with membranes from
HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the receptor of interest
using the Mirus TransIT-293 transfection reagent (peqlab, Erlangen,
Germany) or a solution of linear polyethyleneimine in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), as described previously.42 The cells were incubated together with [3H]SCH23390 (80
Ci/mmol, Biotrend, Cologne, Germany, final concentration 0.40 nM, KD 0.27 nM, Bmax 4900
fmol/mg, protein concentration 1.5 μg/test tube for D1R and 0.50 nM, KD 0.30 nM, Bmax 500 fmol/mg, 10 μg/test tube for D5R), with [3H]WAY100635 (80 Ci/mmol, Biotrend, 0.20 nM
final concentration, KD 0.10 nM, Bmax 3400 fmol/mg, protein concentration 2 μg/test
tube for 5-HT1AR), with [3H]ketanserin (47 Ci/mmol,
PerkinElmer, final concentration 0.20 nM, KD 0.075 nM, Bmax 500 fmol/mg, protein
concentration 10 μg/test tube for 5-HT2AR) or with
[3H]prazosin (84 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, 0.20 nM final concentration, KD 0.095 nM, Bmax 7500 fmol/mg, protein concentration 1.5 μg/test tube for α1A-AR). Binding affinities to the human opioid receptors were
determined using the radioligand [3H]diprenorphine (37
Ci/mmol, Biotrend and 0.20 nM final concentration, KD 0.085 nM, Bmax 1700 fmol/mg,
protein concentration 6 μg/test tube for δOR, 0.30 nM
final concentration, KD 0.070 nM, Bmax 4500 fmol/mg, protein concentration 3 μg/test
tube for κOR, and 0.20 nM final concentration, KD 0.070 nM, Bmax 5000 fmol/mg,
protein concentration 2 μg/test tube for μOR, respectively).
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of haloperidol
(10 μM for D1R–D5R), WAY100635
(10 μM for 5-HT1AR), ketanserin (10 μM for
5-HT2AR), prazosin (10 μM for α1AR), or naloxone (10 μM for δOR, κOR, μOR).
Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration
of 10 mM and diluted in the binding buffer41 to final concentrations in the range of 0.001 nM to 100 μM.
Competition tests were generally performed in 96-well plates at a
final volume of 200 μM. The test compound and radioligand were
incubated together with the appropriate receptor homogenates at 37
°C for 60 min before separating the bound and free radioligands
by filtration through GF/B glass fiber mats. Protein concentration
was established by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin
as the standard.43 Data analysis of the
competition-binding curves from the radioligand displacement experiments
was done by the nonlinear regression analysis when applying the algorithms
of the program PRISM6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). EC50 values were derived from each dose response curve and were
subsequently transformed into the corresponding Ki values by applying the equation of Cheng and Prusoff.44 Mean Ki values are
the result of two individual experiments, each done in triplicate.
