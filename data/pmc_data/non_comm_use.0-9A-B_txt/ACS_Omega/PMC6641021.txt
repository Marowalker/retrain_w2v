In
this study, we present novel insights into the light-soaking
effect of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs), where the open-circuit
voltage (Voc) of the cells improves over
time under light irradiation. The effect was investigated by electron
spin resonance (ESR) studies of bare indium tin oxide (ITO) and piperazine
derivative-modified ITO/regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl
C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) substrates. These
results were combined with alternating current impedance spectroscopy
(IS) measurements of inverted PSCs based on the above substrates.
In ESR experiments with the substrates under white light irradiation,
with a UV light component, many P3HT•+ radical cations
were observed in the bare-ITO/P3HT:PCBM substrate. The number of radical
cations was considerably suppressed in the ITO/P3HT:PCBM substrates
with ITO modified by piperazine derivatives. This is because adsorbed
oxygen molecules on the ITO acted as acceptor dopants for photoexcited
P3HT, and the amount of adsorbed oxygen was decreased by modifying
the ITO with piperazine derivatives. In IS measurements of the inverted
PSCs under white light irradiation, a decrease in the electric capacitance
(CPE2) of an electric double layer formed at the ITO/P3HT:PCBM interface
was observed. A strong correlation was observed between the decrease
of CPE2 and the increase of Voc. From
these results, the light-soaking behavior was attributed to the removal
of an electron injection barrier formed between ITO and PCBM, under
white light irradiation.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells
(PSCs) have attracted much attention as next-generation
solar cells because of their lightweight, flexibility, and low cost
of manufacturing.1−4 Inverted PSCs with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the bottom electrode
and a high work function metal (Au or Ag) as the top electrode show
excellent stability even in ambient air without encapsulation.5−7 ITO is the most widely used transparent electrode in electro-optical
devices because it has high transparency and conductivity. The ionization
potential (Ip) of bare ITO has been reported
to be approximately 4.8 eV.8−11 Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the electron
injection barrier between the ionization potential of ITO and the
LUMO levels of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester
(PCBM) (ca. 3.8 eV) to achieve a high power conversion efficiency.8,12−14 We have previously improved the photovoltaic properties
of inverted PSCs using ITO surfaces modified by aliphatic amine compounds
having simple chemical structures.15 The Ip of the modified ITO electrodes decreased compared
to that of untreated electrodes; however, we observed that the open-circuit
voltage (Voc) in all of the PSCs containing
bare ITO electrodes gradually improved under continuous light irradiation,
the so-called light-soaking effect. Although this phenomenon is now
well-known in the field of photovoltaics, including inorganic photovoltaics,
such as CIGS solar cells,16−18 there are few satisfactory mechanistic
explanations for the effect operating in organic photovoltaics.19−21

Alternating current impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements
can
be used to quantify the electrical properties of bulk and interfacial
materials that cannot be determined by direct current methods. We
have previously used IS to investigate inverted PSCs containing metal
oxides as electron collection electrodes.22−26 Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is also
a promising method for the microscopic characterization of charge-accumulation
sites. Charge carriers in most organic semiconductors have a spin,
which allows the use of ESR to directly observe charge carriers that
accumulate during device operation.27−29 The ESR method has been
successfully used to determine the microscopic properties of charge-carrier
states in organic devices, including spin states and the spatial extent
of wave functions in organic materials at device interfaces. We have
previously investigated the mechanism of the light-soaking effect
that accompanied a short-circuit photocurrent increase in inverted
PSCs containing amorphous titanium oxide, using both ESR and IS methods.30

In this study, we investigated the mechanism
of the light-soaking
effect and the accompanying Voc increase
by studying the features of the interface between amine-modified ITO
substrates and an organic photoactive layer.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Bare ITO or Amine-Modified ITO/Poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT):PCBM Substrates
Zhou et al. have previously reported
a decrease in the ionization potential (Ip) of bare ITO under UV light irradiation, as measured by UV photoelectron
spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. From these measurements,
it was concluded that the decrease of Ip was caused by the desorption of oxygen on the ITO.31 When the ITO substrate absorbs UV light, electrons in the
valence band are excited to the conduction band. This causes oxygen
to desorb from the ITO surface, removing the electrostatic interaction
acting between the ITO surface and the adsorbed oxygen molecules.

Figure 1 shows the
chemical structures of piperazine, N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine
(NAP), and 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine (BAP), which were the
three amines used in this study. Amine-modified ITO substrates were
prepared from the piperazine, NAP, and BAP solutions of various concentrations
from 20 μM to 4 M. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the Ip of the modified ITO substrates and the amine concentration
in the cast solutions. The Ip decreased
with increasing amine concentration because the amine molecules are
adsorbed to ITO by displacing the adsorbed oxygen molecules. The minimum Ip values of the piperazine-, NAP-, and BAP-modified
ITO substrates were 4.43, 4.42, and 4.40 eV, respectively. The Ip was reduced more effectively for a larger
number of amino groups in the amine molecule, in the order of piperazine
< NAP < BAP.15 However, the Ip of the modified ITOs suddenly increased when
BAP and NAP solutions with concentrations greater than 1 and 2 M,
respectively, were spin-cast. This result suggests that when a large
excess of piperazine derivatives was deposited on ITO, the amines
acted as an insulator, which interfered with photoelectron emission
from the ITO.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of piperazine derivatives used for
preparing
the modified ITO electrodes.

Figure 2 Plots of Ip of various amine-modified
ITO electrodes against the concentration of the amines in ethanol
solutions used to prepare the modified electrodes.

Piperazine-, NAP-, and BAP-modified ITO substrates
that were adjusted
to Ip = 4.6 eV were analyzed by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the high-resolution N 1s XPS
spectra shown in Figure 3a, we observed one broad N 1s peak at a binding energy of 401 eV,
which had a full width at half-maximum of 3.5 eV. Figure 3b shows an example of peak-fitting
analysis of the XPS spectrum of the BAP-modified ITO substrate. The
spectrum consisted of three components with peak-binding energies
of 400.5, 401.5, and 402.8 eV. The component with the lowest peak-binding
energy of 400.5 eV is assigned to neutral BAP, whereas other components
are assigned to protonated BAP adsorbed to the ITO substrate.14,15 From these results, we confirmed that the adsorption of amine molecules
was caused by a neutralization reaction between the basic amino groups
and the acidic hydroxyl groups of ITO.15 Thus, an electric double layer was formed between the protonated
amino groups and the deprotonated hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface,
which promoted the release of photoelectrons from ITO. This may be
one reason for the lower Ip of the amine-modified
ITOs.

ITO substrates with Ip = 4.6 eV (a), and

(b).

Measurements of the ESR of a bare
ITO (Ip = 4.8 eV)/P3HT:PCBM substrate,
a BAP-modified ITO (Ip = 4.4 eV)/P3HT:PCBM
substrate, and a BAP-modified ITO
(Ip = 5.1 eV)/P3HT:PCBM substrate were
performed to characterize the charge accumulation at the ITO/P3HT:PCBM
interfaces. Figure 4a shows the ESR spectra measured in the dark and after white light
irradiation, with a UV light component, for the bare ITO (Ip = 4.8 eV) and the BAP-modified ITO (Ip = 5.1 eV) substrates. Almost no signal was
observed under dark conditions, but clear ESR signals with similar
intensities were observed for the three substrates directly after
white light irradiation, as shown by the blue lines in Figure 4a. The g value
and the peak-to-peak linewidth (ΔHpp) for the substrates were approximately 2.002 and 0.22 mT, respectively.
The signals originated from the P3HT•+ radical cations
(positive polarons) in the charge-transfer complexes of P3HT+:PCBM–, which are produced transiently by light
absorption.27 ESR signals due to adsorbed
oxygen molecules on the ITO substrates were not observed because the
range of the resonance magnetic field was outside the measured magnetic
field.32 In addition, ESR signals due to
oxygen radical anions O2– were not observed
because of the broadening of the ESR linewidth resulting from fast
relaxation due to orbital rotation.33,34 The number
of spins (Nspin) of P3HT•+ radical cations was estimated from the double integration of the
ESR signals.27Figure 4b shows the time dependence of the Nspin under light irradiation and in the dark.
The Nspin increased gradually with increasing
light irradiation time. However, after continuous white light irradiation
for 18 h, the Nspin accumulated in the
bare ITO substrate was much larger than that in the BAP-modified ITO
substrates. Even when the bare ITO substrate was left in the dark
for 10 h, its Nspin value was about 70%
of that observed just before turning off the light, as shown by the
black plots in Figure 4b. A similar decay behavior was observed for the BAP-modified ITO
(Ip = 4.4 eV) substrate, as shown by the
red plots in Figure 4b, although the Nspin declined to zero
after the substrate was left in the dark for 10 h. Adsorbed oxygen
molecules on the ITO were released by UV light exposure,31 and these molecules behaved as acceptor dopants
in the P3HT:PCBM active layer. Thus, the P3HT was gradually oxidized
by the released oxygen molecules. As a result, more P3HT•+ radical cations were produced from the bare ITO substrate, which
had initially adsorbed more oxygen molecules. In this way, we indirectly
showed the release of oxygen molecules adsorbing to ITO using ESR
measurements under white light irradiation with a UV light component.

Figure 4 (a) ESR
spectra in the dark (black line) and after white light
irradiation for 1 h (blue line) and 15 h (red line) for bare ITO (Ip = 4.8 eV)/P3HT:PCBM (left-hand side) and BAP-modified
ITO (Ip = 5.1 eV)/P3HT:PCBM (right-hand
side) substrates, and (b) the time dependence of P3HT•+ spin number (Nspin) for bare ITO (Ip = 4.8 eV)/P3HT:PCBM (black symbols), BAP-modified
ITO (Ip = 4.4 eV)/P3HT:PCBM (red symbols),
and BAP-modified ITO (Ip = 5.1 eV)/P3HT:PCBM
(blue symbols) substrates.

In contrast to the increase in the Nspin in the BAP-modified ITO (Ip = 4.4 eV)
substrate under continuous light irradiation, the Nspin in the excess BAP-modified ITO (Ip = 5.1 eV) substrate hardly increased, after a small
initial increase, as shown by the blue symbols in Figure 4b. Furthermore, after the light
was turned off, the Nspin in the latter
substrate decreased rapidly compared with the slow decline in the
former. This means that no P3HT•+ radical cation
was formed by oxidization from oxygen molecules released from the
ITO surface because fewer oxygen molecules were adsorbed to the BAP-modified
ITO substrate with Ip = 5.1 eV than those
to the BAP-modified ITO substrate with Ip = 4.4 eV.

In Figure 5, we
summarize a plausible schematic process by which the P3HT•+ radical cations gradually accumulate in the ITO/P3HT:PCBM substrates
under continuous white light irradiation: (a) generation of oxygen
anions, such as O2–, by the adsorption
of oxygen molecules onto ITO, (b) spin coating of the P3HT:PCBM active
layer onto the ITO, (c) electron transfer from oxygen anions to ITO
by UV irradiation, (d) oxygen desorption, and (e) oxidization of P3HT
by the released oxygen molecules.

accumulation of P3HT•+ radical cations in the ITO/P3HT:PCBM
substrate by
the generation of oxygen anions, such as O2–, from adsorbed oxygen molecules on the ITO (a), spin coating of
the P3HT:PCBM active layer (b), electron transfer from oxygen anions
to ITO by UV irradiation (c), subsequent oxygen desorption (d), and
oxidization of photoexcited P3HT by released oxygen molecules (e).

Suppression of the Light-Soaking
Behavior of Inverted PSCs with
Amine-Modified ITOs
Figure 6 shows the time dependence of the current–voltage
(I–V) curves for inverted PSCs containing
bare ITO and BAP-modified ITO electrodes under continuous white light
irradiation. The performance of the cells with bare ITO (Ip = 4.8 eV) was improved because the open-circuit voltage
(Voc) gradually increased through the
light-soaking effect. The Voc increased
from its initial value of 0.25 to 0.54 V after light irradiation for
1 h, whereas the short-circuit current (Jsc) remained almost unchanged. Finally, the maximum power-conversion
efficiency (PCE) of 2.22% was obtained under light irradiation for
2 h. When the BAP-modified ITOs were used as the electron-collection
electrodes, the light-soaking behavior gradually disappeared as the Ip of the modified ITO decreased. Thus, the Voc of the device based on BAP-modified ITO,
with the lowest Ip of 4.4 eV, increased
from its initial value of 0.48 V to a maximum of 0.56 V after a few
minutes of light irradiation. This device also exhibited a better Jsc and fill factor (FF) compared to those of
the devices based on ITO substrates with a higher Ip and achieved the best PCE of 3.40%. All P3HT:PCBM based
devices using bare ITO and amine-modified ITOs showed a quite high
stability even after light soaking, and they have sufficient reproducibility
for the performance and the light-soaking behavior.

Figure 6 Time-dependent change
of the photo I–V curves
for inverted PSCs containing bare ITO and BAP-modified ITO electrodes
under continuous irradiation by AM 1.5G-100 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight. The Ip values of
the electrodes were 4.8 (a), 4.6 (b), and 4.4 eV (c), respectively.

IS measurements were performed
to gain a better understanding of
the light-soaking effect. Figure 7a,b shows typical Nyquist plots that were obtained
for inverted PSCs containing bare ITO under an applied DC voltage
of 0.5 V, near the Voc, in the dark and
under white light irradiation, respectively. The plots consist of
an arc at a high frequency of more than ca. 150 kHz and a second arc
at a low frequency of less than ca. 150 kHz. The former and the latter
are denoted as arc 1 and arc 2, respectively. The plots were analyzed
with the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 7c, and a reasonable fit to the simulated
curve was obtained. Here, Rs represents
the series resistance, comprising ohmic components, and R1 and R2 are resistance components that form a parallel
circuit with the constant phase elements CPE1 and CPE2, respectively.
The CPEs are roughly equal to the differential capacitances because
there was almost no depression of the arcs. On the basis of our previous
work,22−24 arcs 1 and 2 are related to the components in the
electron-collection electrode and the P3HT:PCBM layer, respectively.
In the dark, the arc size was almost unchanged over 30 min, as shown
in Figure 7a, whereas
arc 2 rapidly decreased from 1300 Ω cm2 in the dark
to about 50 Ω cm2 directly after irradiation, as
shown in Figure 7b.
This large decrease in the resistance component is attributed to the
increase in photoconductive carriers in the P3HT:PCBM film during
light irradiation. However, there was a poor correlation between the R components and the Voc. Although
the R2 increased from 20 Ω cm2 just
after irradiation to 50 Ω cm2 after irradiation for
30 min, the Jsc did not change as shown
in Figure 6a. This R2 value is directly unrelated to the Jsc, that is, the photocurrent under short-circuit condition,
because it is a resistance component in active layer under open-circuit
condition. On the other hand, we found a strong correlation between
the time dependence of the Voc and CPE2
under continuous light irradiation. As shown in Figures 8 and S1, for inverted
PSCs containing bare ITO and BAP-modified ITOs, which had Ip values of 4.80, 4.60, 4.50, and 4.40 eV, the
increase in Voc is strongly correlated
with the decrease in CPE2. Because the differences (ΔCPE2) between
the initial and saturated CPE2 values became smaller with decreasing Ip, as summarized in Table S1, the CPE2 was related to the capacitance of the electric
double layer, as depicted in Figure 5b. In addition, the difference (ΔVoc) between the initial and saturated Voc values also became smaller as Ip decreased. Thus, the electric double layer at the ITO/P3HT:PCBM
interface acted as an electron injection barrier, which disrupted
the electron injection from PCBM to ITO. Figure S2 shows the time dependence of Voc and CPE2 for inverted cells containing piperazine-, NAP-, and BAP-modified
ITO electrodes, both of which had a similar Ip of 4.6 eV. The profiles for these three PSCs were almost
the same. These results show that the light-soaking effect is not
influenced by the type of amine compound but by the Ip value, that is, the charge density of the electric double
layer is determined by the adsorbed oxygen coverage.

applied voltage of 0.5 V in the dark (a) and under AM 1.5G-50 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight irradiation (b). Solid lines indicate
the curves calculated from the equivalent circuit (c).

Figure 8 Time dependence of Voc (black
lines)
and CPE2 (blue open circles) for inverted PSCs containing bare ITO
(Ip = 4.8 eV) (a) and BAP-modified ITO
(Ip = 4.4 eV) (b).

As shown in Figure 6, the light-soaking effect of the PSCs was not attributed
to changes
in the Jsc but instead to changes in the Voc. However, the Jsc values depended on the initial Ip of
the BAP-modified ITO, as shown in Figure 9 and Table S2.
As the Ip of the modified ITO decreased
from 4.80 to 4.40 eV, the Jsc of the PSCs
increased from 7.76 to 9.93 mA cm–2. A lower Ip can increase the built-in potential of the
P3HT:PCBM layer, which is limited by the difference of both the Fermi
levels of ITO and the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(4-styrene
sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) layer, which sandwich the active layer.
Hence, the increase in Jsc is caused by
the drift migration of photoproduced charge carriers occurring more
effectively owing to the higher built-in potential. Figure S3 shows the saturated I–V curves
of the inverted cells fabricated with piperazine-, NAP-, and BAP-modified
ITO set to about the same Ip value of
4.6 eV. Jsc and other parameters in the
three PSCs were similar regardless of the type of amine compound used
to modify the ITO layer, as summarized in Table S3.

Figure 9 Photo I–V curves for the inverted PSCs
containing bare ITO and BAP-modified ITO with various Ip after white light irradiation for 120 min.

Although the built-in potential increased because
of the increase
in Voc caused by the light-soaking effect,
the Jsc did not change, as shown in Figure 6a. As discussed in
relation to the ESR results, P3HT can be oxidized by oxygen molecules
released from the ITO surface under UV light exposure, as shown in Figure 5e. Thus, P3HT•+ radical cations are formed, and localized dopant
anions, such as O2–, are produced near
the ITO/P3HT interface. Ions close to the ITO may interfere with the
injection of the photoproduced electrons into ITO because of electrostatic
interactions. In fact, as shown in Figure 9, the Jsc value
increased as the Ip of the BAP-modified
ITO decreased. Therefore, the Jsc value
is determined by the initial amount of oxygen molecules adsorbed at
the ITO/P3HT:PCBM interface, which in turn depends on the coverage
rate of amine compounds.

Conclusions
The Ip of ITO substrates treated with
ethanol solutions containing piperazine derivatives decreased. The
amine modification coupled with the removal of oxygen molecules adsorbed
to the bare ITO resulted in a decrease of the Ip. Furthermore, the ESR measurements of the bare ITO/P3HT:PCBM
substrates under continuous light irradiation, with a UV light component,
revealed P3HT•+ radical cations oxidized by desorbed
oxygen molecules. Thus, using ESR, we indirectly demonstrated the
release of oxygen molecules adsorbed on bare ITO, which acted as acceptor
dopants.

In inverted PSCs containing bare ITO/P3HT:PCBM, we
observed a remarkable
light-soaking effect, in which Voc gradually
increased under continuous light irradiation. This phenomenon was
suppressed when the ITO was modified with piperazine derivatives.
For the light-soaking effect, the increase in Voc was strongly correlated with the decrease in CPE2, which
represented the capacitance of an electric double layer formed at
the ITO/P3HT:PCBM interface. From these results, we concluded that
the light-soaking effect in these PSCs occurs by the removal of an
electron injection barrier from PCBM to ITO.

Experimental Section

Piperazine, NAP, BAP, regioregular P3HT (Mn 30 000–60 000), Triton-X
100, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2-Propanol (IPA) and ethanol were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co.
PEDOT:PSS dispersion in water (Clevios P) (1.3 wt %) was purchased
from H.C. Starck. PCBM was purchased from Frontier Carbon. ITO substrates
(sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq–1) and Au wires
were purchased from Furuuchi Chemical Corporation. Quartz substrates
were purchased from Iiyama Precision Glass Co., Ltd. ITO layers (10
Ω sq–1) on the quartz substrates were fabricated
by Geomatec Co., Ltd. Masking tape E-MASK TP200 was provided from
Nitto Denko. Lamination film Cellel F1550H was purchased from Kureha
Extech.

Preparation of Amine-Modified ITO
The ITO electrode
was ultrasonic-cleaned in IPA, washed in boiling IPA, and then dried
in air. The substrate was partly covered with E-MASK TP200 to prevent
any excess modification of the amines. Ethanol was used as the solvent
for piperazine, NAP, and BAP. The amine solutions were dropped onto
the ITO substrates and then spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 1 min. The
substrates were then dried at 120 °C for 10 min on a hot plate.
To remove any excess amine from the ITO, the same operation was performed
using ethanol. These operations were performed in air. Glass–ITO
substrates were used for most experiments; however, quartz–ITO
substrates were used for the ESR measurements.

Fabrication of Inverted
PSCs
The photoactive layer
was prepared from a DCB solution containing P3HT (16.7 mg mL–1) and PCBM (13.3 mg mL–1). The solution was spin-coated
onto the amine-modified ITO substrates, and the resulting films were
solvent-annealed for 40 min in an airtight container. Subsequently,
a PEDOT:PSS dispersion in water containing 0.5 wt % Triton-X 100 as
a surfactant was spin-coated onto the hydrophobic P3HT:PCBM layer,
and the resulting PEDOT:PSS film was dried at room temperature for
30 min. These operations were also performed in air with the relative
humidity maintained at less than 30%. The thicknesses of the P3HT:PCBM
and PEDOT:PSS layers were approximately 200 and 150 nm, respectively.
The Au rear electrode was vacuum-deposited at 2 × 10–5 Torr on the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, the device was mechanically
protected by thermal compression using Cellel F1550H.35 The effective area of the cells was 1 cm2.

Measurements
The ionization potential (Ip) of the modified ITO substrates was estimated in the
dark by photoelectron spectroscopy in air with a Riken Keiki AC-2.
XPS measurements were performed with a Shimadzu AXIS-ULTRA DLD XPS
apparatus. The time-dependent change of the I–V curves of the PSCs was measured by a linear sweep voltammetry at
a scan rate of 5 V min–1 in combination with a rest
voltage measurement under AM 1.5G-100 mW cm–2 simulated
sunlight irradiation. The time-dependent change of the Voc under AM 1.5G-50 mW cm–2 simulated
sunlight irradiation was measured under the photocurrent at zero.
The DC measurements were implemented with a Hokuto Denko HZ-5000 electrochemical
analyzer. The IS measurements were performed with an Agilent Technologies
E4980A precision LCR meter in the dark and under AM 1.5G-50 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight irradiation. The frequency range
was from 20 Hz to 1 MHz, and the alternating signal magnitude was
5 mV. The data obtained were fitted with Scribner Associates Z-VIEW
software v3.1 with the appropriate equivalent circuits. The light
source was a SAN-EI Electric XES-301S solar simulator, which was calibrated
with a standard silicon photovoltaic detector. These measurements
were carried out in ambient atmosphere, that is, at 25 °C, at
a relative humidity of 40–60%.

ESR measurements were
performed with a JEOL RESONANCE JES-FA200 X-band spectrometer under
nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The measurements under AM
1.5G-100 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight irradiation
were obtained with a Bunkoukeiki OTENTOSUN-150BXM solar simulator
as the light source. The number of spins and the g values of the ESR signals were calibrated using a standard Mn2+ marker sample.
