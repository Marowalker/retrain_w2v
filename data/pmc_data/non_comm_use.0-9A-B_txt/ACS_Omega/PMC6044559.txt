Simultaneous integration
of photon emission and biocompatibility
into nanoparticles is an interesting strategy to develop applications
of advanced optical materials. In this work, we present the synthesis
of biocompatible optical nanocomposites from the combination of near-infrared
luminescent lanthanide nanoparticles and water-soluble chitosan. NaYF4:Yb,Er upconverting nanocrystal guests and water-soluble chitosan
hosts are prepared and integrated together into biofunctional optical
composites. The control of aqueous dissolution, gelation, assembly,
and drying of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocolloids and chitosan liquids
allowed us to design novel optical structures of spongelike aerogels
and beadlike microspheres. Well-defined shape and near-infrared response
lead upconverting nanocrystals to serve as photon converters to couple
with plasmonic gold (Au) nanoparticles. Biocompatible chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites are prepared to show their
potential use in biomedicine as we find them exhibiting a half-maximal
effective concentration (EC50) of 0.58 mg mL–1 for chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods versus
0.24 mg mL–1 for chitosan-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er after 24 h. As a result of their low cytotoxicity and upconverting
response, these novel materials hold promise to be interesting for
biomedicine, analytical sensing, and other applications.

1 Introduction
Biocompatible
optical nanomaterials are of interest as smart tools
for applications in many fields of science and healthcare technologies.1,2 There has been an increasing demand for fabricating functional devices
from these materials. In this framework, light-sensitive nanocomponents
and biopolymers are considered as novel substances to combine together
into promising nanocomposites.3 The optical
and biocompatible responses endow these composites with a wide range
of desirable properties for their prospective use in medicine, bioimaging,
sensing, adsorption, and photocatalysis.4 A great potential of these composites is useful for biomedical imaging
because of low cytotoxicity of biopolymers and sensitive response
of optical nanoelements.5 It is of key
importance to manipulate the surface, morphological, and structural
features of the integrated materials to obtain a homogeneous incorporation
of the functional components for improving their reaction performance.6 With multiple-purpose applications, attempts
of fabricating biocompatible optical nanocomposites with different
structural forms, such as spongelike aerogels, beadlike spheres, hybrids,
or water-dispersible colloids, are of great significance to the scientific
community.

Upconverting (UC) materials can absorb photons and
emit visible
light after excitation by near-infrared (NIR) light.7 The NIR-emitting luminescence is known to be a photophysical
process of photon UC emission. NaYF4:Yb,Er is a well-known
UC material composed of an insulating NaYF4 host and Yb3+ and Er3+ dopants incorporated into the matrix
lattice.8 Remarkably, NaYF4:Yb,Er
UC nanocrystals can convert near-infrared light to visible light through
lanthanide (Yb3+ and Er3+) doping, attributed
to energy transfer pathways by dopant–host interactions.7 Thanks to structure-dependent photon efficiency,
the control of the size, shape, and crystallinity of the NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanomaterials would enable the development of optical
bioprobes with improved performance.9,10 Accordingly,
the low-energy light absorption, high sensitivity, low toxicity, and
structural stability make NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanoparticles
useful as novel photon upconverters to fabricating advanced optical
materials for applications in biomedical imaging, security labeling,
and energy conversion.11−14

Chitosan is the deacetylated derivative of chitin as a major
biopolymer
component present in the shells of crustaceans15 and in the cell walls of some fungal species.16 The alkaline deacetylation of natural chitin
generates polycationic networks of chitosan nanofibrils with exposed
primary amine groups, which are capable of enhancing the chemical
reactivity for surface functionalization. As an abundant biopolymer
on the earth, many attempted syntheses have used chitosan-based materials
as an aqueous stabilizer for nanoparticles,17 a fibril precursor for bioplastics and gels,18−20 and a polymer
template for hierarchical porous materials.21 The aqueous solubility, low cytotoxicity, and polycation of chitosan
are crucial factors in determining the efficiency of their derivatives
in biomedicine. Regarding the potential for drug delivery and cellular
imaging, cationic chitosan-based components have been proven to present
stronger electrostatic interactions with anionic cell membranes, which
facilitates cellular uptake.22 This behavior,
combined with its low cytotoxic response, often results in materials
with potential biomedical applications. Another interesting aspect
is the homogeneous solubility of native chitosan nanofibrils in water
as they typically dissolve in acidic media by surface protonation.
It is thus desirable to obtain neutral aqueous liquids of native chitosan
and use them as either a particle stabilizer or gelling agent for
biocompatible optical nanocomposites to enhance their applications
in the field of biomedicine.23−25 One notable example of this subject
has been reported by Duan et al.26 on the
use of the freezing–thawing process of chitosan/alkali/urea
solutions to prepare biocompatible chitosan hydrogels for controlled
drug release applications.

To achieve the potential of optical
materials for bioimaging and
analytical sensing, it is of interest to combine luminescent NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanoparticles with water-soluble chitosan into chitosan-coated
UC nanocomposites. It is also interesting to control the host–guest
interactions of these functional components by dispersibility, self-assembly,
and solidification to design biocompatible optical nanocomposites
with different structures and compositions for extending their potential
uses.27 To date, several efforts have been
made to prepare chitosan-functionalized NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles
for near-infrared photodynamic therapy.28,29 However, there
are limited descriptions on the preparation of aerogels and microspheres
of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles supported by water-soluble
chitosan.

Herein, we report the synthesis of well-defined NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanocrystals and the subsequent coating with water-soluble
chitosan to generate biocompatible optical nanocomposites. This combination
is based on aqueous stabilization, gelation, solidification, and assembled
confinement to fabricate NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aerogels,
microspheres, and hybrid materials. The cytotoxic responses of chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites in comparison to those of
chitosan-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles were tested
to show their potential use in biomedical applications.

2 Results and Discussion
Hydrothermal treatment of a basic
solution of lanthanide nitrates,
sodium fluoride, and oleic acid (OA) in a water/ethanol mixture at
190 °C yielded OA-capped NaYF4 UC nanocrystals codoped
with 20 wt % Yb3+ and 2 wt % Er3+ (Figure S1a). We found that the precursor concentration
and reaction time have a major influence on the morphological distribution
of the as-prepared UC nanocrystals. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images in Figure 1a–c
show that the UC nanocrystals are uniform single-crystalline hexagonal
nanorods with concave ends having 150 nm sized six facets and ∼800
nm length. The synthetic product is a particle mixture of 20 nm sized
cubes and ∼100 × 1500 nm2 sized rods when the
precursor concentration used is 2 times greater than that of the UC
hexagonal nanorods (Figure 1d). This shape variation is related to the evolution gradient
of monomers in the bulk solution.30 Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analyses (Figure S1b) confirm
the presence of Na, F, Y, Yb, and Er with a similar atomic ratio in
these UC nanoparticles prepared using the low and high precursor concentrations.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses (Figure 1e) show a binary mixture of a major hexagonal
β-phase and a minor cubic α-phase in highly crystalline
NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods.31 Conversely, the cube-/rod-shaped NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles
contain the cubic α-phase predominantly rather than the hexagonal
β-phase. The relative intensity of the (100) diffraction peak
of the NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods is much larger than
that of the NaYF4:Yb,Er cubes/nanorods, suggesting that
the elongation axis of the hexagonal nanorods is along the [100] direction.
Note that in the NaYF4:Yb,Er structure the β-hexagonal
phase is thermodynamically stable, whereas the α-cube phase
is metastable. There is thus a crystal transition of an α-cube
phase to a β-hexagonal phase in the NaYF4:Yb,Er UC
nanoparticles prepared upon extended heating.

UC nanocrystals. (a) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of UC hexagonal nanorod arrays, (b) TEM image of an individual UC
hexagonal nanorod viewed along its tip, (c) TEM image viewed along
a tip of assembled UC hexagonal nanorods showing concave surfaces,
(d) TEM image of cube-/rod-shaped UC nanocrystals, (e) PXRD patterns,
and (f) UC photoluminescence (PL) spectra of NaYF4:Yb,Er
hexagonal nanorods (red) and NaYF4:Yb,Er cube-/rod-shaped
nanocrystals (blue). The inset shows a photo of UC hexagonal nanorod
powders emitting brilliant green color under 980 nm laser excitation.

The OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanocrystals emit brilliant
green light when excited under near-infrared laser light (980 nm),
where the hexagonal nanorods exhibit stronger emission than the cubes/nanorods
(inset of Figure 1f).
Photoluminescence spectra (Figure 1f) of the OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal
nanorods under 980 nm laser excitation show three main emission peaks
at 522.5, 541.5, and 655.5 nm as a result of the 4H11/2–4I15/2 (green), 4S3/2–4I15/2 (green), and 4F9/2–4I15/2 (red)
UC transitions, respectively, of Er3+ dopants.32 The OA-capped UC nanocube/rods also exhibit
three main peaks at the same wavelengths as in the OA-capped UC hexagonal
nanorods but display a lower emission intensity. The appearance of
the enhanced photoluminescence in the NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal
nanorods is due to the β-hexagonal phase being predominant than
the α-cubic one.

The well-defined NaYF4:Yb,Er
hexagonal nanorods with
sensitive NIR photoresponse can be used as novel converters for the
design of functional optical materials. Much progress has been made
toward achieving structural diversity of the NaYF4:Yb,Er-based
nanomaterials for a variety of applications.33 Notable examples are metal–organic framework/NaYF4:Ln core–shells for NIR-enhanced photocatalysis,34 NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles for latent
fingerprints,35 NaYF4:Yb,Er
UC/magnetite/dye nanocomposites for oxygen sensing,36 lipid-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles for bioimaging
and gene delivery,37 and CdSe/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanohybrids for photovoltaics.38 Owing to the inherent characteristics of low-energy light absorption
with minimal cell damage, the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles
are extensively used in biomedicine. The goal of this strategy is
limited to the cytotoxicity of the lanthanide-doped UC nanoparticles
with biopolymers to achieve the biocompatibility. Consequently, we
combined the NaYF4:Yb,Er-based hexagonal nanorods with
water-soluble chitosan to design different structural types of biocompatible
optical composites.

We found that water-soluble chitosan macromolecules
could be prepared
by acetylation of native chitosan nanofibrils with acetic anhydride
and sequential dissolution of acetylated chitosan in water to form
an optically clear aqueous solution. This solubility is different
from that of conventional chitosan prepared by alkaline deacetylation
of chitin as it often does not dissolve in water because of the high
crystallinity of the fibrils.39 It is noteworthy
that our acetylation procedure can yield the homogeneous aqueous solution
of chitosan polymorphs rather than crystalline fibrils as confirmed
by PXRD (Figure S2). The acetylation-induced
aqueous dissolution of chitosan is assumed to present disrupted hydrogen
bonding within the fibrils, leading to the decreased crystallinity.
As a result, the acetylated chitosan fibrils swell dramatically in
water and then fully dissolve to form a viscous polymeric liquid.

The hydrophobic surface of the OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er
nanoparticles renders them dispersible in nonpolar solvents, but they
could not be in the form of the aqueous dispersion. The surface modification
of the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles with hydrophilic
and biocompatible properties is thus an important step to extend their
potential to biomedicine. We prepared the aqueous dispersion of chitosan-stabilized
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles by sequential coating of the
OA-capped UC colloids with ethylene glycol and water-soluble chitosan.
Remarkably, the resulting NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles became
dispersible in water as the aqueous colloidal solution can be stable
for several months (Figure S11). Infrared
spectra (Figure S3) of the functionalized
UC nanoparticles show distinct stretching bands of amides and hydroxyls,
verifying that the OA-capped nanoparticles adsorbed with chitosan.
Notably, the surface coating of the OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er
nanocolloids with water-soluble chitosan mostly retains the morphological,
dispersible, and optical features (Figures 2c and S4).

aqueous dispersion, (d) SEM image of UC/chitosan aerogel composites,
(e) PXRD pattern, and (f) UC photoluminescence spectrum of UC/chitosan
aerogel composites.

Owing to their low density,
large porosity, and high surface area,
optical biopolymer aerogels are an exciting class of soft materials
for applications in sensing, absorption, insulation, and tissue engineering.40−42 We found that the prepared water-soluble chitosan is a good polymeric
matrix to support the chitosan-functionalized NaYF4:Yb,Er
colloids, encouraging us to fabricate NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan
aerogels. The chitosan-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er colloids and
glyoxal cross-linkers were mixed with water-soluble chitosan to form
a homogeneous and optically transparent dispersion. These mixtures
were thermally gelated at 80 °C to form NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan
hydrogels (Figure S5). The removal of water
in the hydrogels by freeze-drying yielded intact NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan
aerogel composites (Figure 2b, right). Under lyophilization, the frozen NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan hydrogels released water by sublimation to leave
large interconnected interspaces in solidified networks, forming NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aerogels. The aerogel structure appears to
be a homogeneous porous network of highly interconnected chitosan
nanofibrils, where no phase separation of the NaYF4:Yb,Er
nanoparticles is observed, indicating a good distribution of the UC
guests into the biopolymer host.

The aerogel composite is a
heterogeneous mixture of α,β-NaYF4:Yb,Er crystals
and chitosan polymorphs (PXRD, Figure 2e). The aerogel composites
are thermally stable up to ∼300 °C, above which chitosan
is decomposed to leave ∼10 wt % of oxidized NaYF4:Yb,Er component (thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Figure S6). SEM images (Figure 2d) of the aerogel composites show the random distribution
of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods in the aerogel networks of
the solidified chitosan assemblies. These results reveal that the
glyoxal-crosslinked gelation of NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aqueous
dispersions occurs upon curing to form gel composites. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan composites show a
mesoporous structure, indicative of forming macro–mesoporous
networks in the aerogels (Figure S6a).
Laser excitation of the composites at 980 nm emits visible green light
through the aerogels, reflecting a good guest/host combination (Figure 2b, left). Photoluminescence
spectra (Figure 2f)
of the aerogels show UC emission peaks, with the wavelengths and intensities
mostly resembling those of the pristine NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals,
suggesting that the sequential gelation and solidification of water-soluble
chitosan retain the optical properties of the UC nanoparticles. Although
many nanostructures of luminescent chitosan composite gels based on
nanocarbons43−45 and nanosemiconductors,46,47 for example, have been reported, this is the first preparation of
the upconverting NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aerogels. Apart from
their promising biomedical applications, the enlarged porous networks
may facilitate the diffusion of volatile reactants to make the UC/chitosan
aerogels useful as gas optical sensors.48

Optical biopolymer microsphere colloids have aroused attention
for applications in drug delivery.49,50 Keeping this
demand in mind, we further explored the fabrication of NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan microspheres. In general, the NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan
aqueous dispersions can self-organize into microspheres via microemulsion-assisted
assembly, where the optical guests are embedded within the chitosan
host. The synthesis involves a precursor aqueous phase confined in
an oil/surfactant phase. The precursor aqueous phase was prepared
by mixing the chitosan-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er aqueous dispersion
and glyoxal with water-soluble chitosan to form a homogeneous mixture.
The solvent (oil) phase was prepared by dissolving Span 80 surfactant
in paraffin. An emulsion system was prepared by mixing these phases
together under sequential stirring and sonication. The emulsion mixture
was transferred into a round-bottomed flask, sealed, and then heated
to 80 °C under moderate stirring to crosslink chitosan by glyoxal,
producing solidified NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan microspheres.
We first examined the synthesized materials using optical microscopy.
It is apparent from the optical images that both the solidified products
before and after purification are dispersible microspheres (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 Self-assembly of NaYF4:Yb,Er UC hexagonal nanorods with
water-soluble chitosan into microspheres. (a) Photos of UC/chitosan
microsphere aqueous dispersion under visible light (left) and NIR
light (right), (b) optical microscopy images of UC/chitosan microspheres
in the microemulsion dispersion (left) and aqueous media (right),
and (c) SEM image and (d) TEM image of UC/chitosan microspheres.

The solidified microspheres were
collected and dispersed in water
to form a microsphere aqueous solution (Figure 3a, left). On shining the 980 nm laser light
through the samples, the solidified products and their aqueous solutions
both emit green light (Figure 3a, right). Structural and elemental analyses reveal that the
solidified product is a heterogeneous mixture of α,β-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals and chitosan polymorphs (PXRD, Figure S7a). Thermal analyses (Figure S7b) confirm ∼5 wt % NaYF4:Yb,Er
in the chitosan-based composites. Photoluminescence spectrum (Figure S8) of the microsphere composites shows
the retention of the spectral features of the pristine NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods. SEM images (Figures 3c and S9) of the solidified
products show a broad size distribution of microspheres in the diameter
range of 150–200 μm. The NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods
embedded within the chitosan microspheres seem to be distinguished
by TEM, as presented in Figures 3d and S10. These analyses
confirm the formation of the photoluminescent NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan
microspheres in the microemulsion system with the assistance of the
Span 80 nonionic surfactant. In the oil/water phases, the hydrophobic
alkyl tails of the surfactant move forward to the oil phase (paraffin),
whereas its hydrophilic oleate heads (functional groups) move forward
oppositely to the aqueous phase (water). This chemical behavior leads
to the formation of stable sphere-shaped micelles containing NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aqueous hydrogels confined within the paraffin
oil phase. Under glyoxal crosslinking and curing, the NaYF4:Yb,Er-supported chitosan networks can be crosslinked to form rigid
hydrogel microspheres. Although several examples have recently been
reported for chitosan spheres, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first combination of NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanoparticles
and water-soluble chitosan into the biocompatible optical microsphere
colloids.

The structural design of the nanomaterials with multioptical
properties
is also a goal to enhance their desirable functionalities.27,51 We realized that the well-defined anisotropic shape and good dispersity
can lead the NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods to serve as
an efficient UC support for plasmonic additives. In a typical preparation,
a HAuCl4 ethylene glycol solution was mixed with an OA-capped
NaYF4:Yb,Er ethanol dispersion under stirring to form a
homogeneous mixture. These mixed dispersions were hydrothermally treated
at 80 °C to prepare Au/NaYF4:Er,Yb nanocomposites.
The reaction mixtures slowly turned from yellow to purple upon heating,
indicating the formation of Au nanoparticles (Figure 4a). PXRD analyses reveal the structural retention
of α,β-NaYF4 crystals in the nanocomposites,
and the Au component could not be detected, possibly due to its low
loading concentration (Figure S12). However,
electron microscope images (Figure 4b) show the surface deposition of some uniform Au nanodots
with ∼50 nm particle size on the single NaYF4:Er,Yb
nanorods. These structural analyses confirm the selective decoration
of the Au nanoparticles on the NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods
to generate plasmonic upconverting nanohybrids.

and their dose-dependent cytotoxicity. (a) Photos of chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposite aqueous dispersion under visible
light (left) and NIR light (right), (b) SEM image of Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites, (c) UC photoluminescence spectra of Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites (green) in comparison to those of NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods (red), (d) UV–vis absorption
spectrum of Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites and WST-1 viability
assay of chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites
in comparison to those of chitosan-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er
hexagonal nanorods after 24 h (e) and 72 h (f).

Ethylene glycol can act as a weak reductant to perform the
polyol-assisted
reduction of some metal ions under hydrothermal conditions. At elevated
temperature, ethylene glycol is able to slowly reduce Au3+ into small Au nanoparticles, which are then attached on the NaYF4:Er,Yb nanorods. The weak reduction allows one to control
the growth and size distribution of the Au nanodots in the nanocomposites.
This hydrothermal polyol reduction provides an advantage over conventional
methods, which often use strong reductants such as NaBH4 or ascorbic acid to obtain deposited Au nanoparticles with larger
irregular sizes, as additionally evidenced in Figure S14. The UC emission peaks of the Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites have the same wavelengths as those of the pristine
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods (three maxima at 522.5, 541.5, and
655.5 nm); however, their spectral emission has a significantly higher
intensity (Figure 4c). UV–vis spectra (Figure 4d) of the Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites
show a maximum plasmon absorbance at ∼540 nm for the Au nanoparticles.
The plasmon-enhanced upconverting photoluminescence in the Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites may be caused by the plasmon–photon
coupling effect, as recently reported elsewhere.52,53

To explore the biomedical compatibility, we further prepared
chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites by dispersing the ethylene
glycol-capped Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites in water-soluble
chitosan. A stable colloidal solution of the Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er
nanohybrids can be obtained after sonication (Figure 4a). Again, the aqueous stability of these
nanocomposite colloids is due to the surface adsorption of water-soluble
chitosan. The chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites
maintain the morphological integrity of the pristine samples (Figure S15).

We investigated the cytotoxic
response of the chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites (Figure 4a) in comparison to that of the chitosan-stabilized
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles (Figure S11) to assess their suitability for biomedical diagnosis. In this sense,
the lack of the functional moieties on the UC nanoparticle surfaces
is often an obstacle that needs to be addressed for biomedical applications.
To date, the UC nanoparticles have been coated with silica, sodium
gluconate, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(acrylic
acid), cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes, phosphatidylcholine,
and hyaluronate to improve their biocompatibility.54−58 Our present work has used native chitosan polycation
as a water-soluble biopolymer to coat the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles
and Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanohybrids for generating the novel
biocompatible optical composites.22

Figure 4e,f shows
the cytotoxic response of these materials. The experimental results
were performed by incubating different concentrations of nanoparticles
from 10 to 5000 μg mL–1 with living cells
in culture for 24 and 72 h. The dose response for the chitosan-stabilized
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles presents half-maximal effective
concentrations (EC50) of 240 and 96 μg mL–1 after 24 and 72 h, respectively. After Au deposition, the respective
EC50 value is notably increased to 580 and 410 μg
mL–1, respectively. The high cell viability of the
chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites is remarkable,
which is found to be more than 80% when incubated for 24 h at the
concentration of 500 μg mL–1. Overall, these
UC nanocomposites present enhanced biocompatibility in comparison
to that reported in previous works.59 This
enhancement may arise from the chitosan coating to avoid the possible
release of toxic lanthanide ions to the surrounding cellular environment.60 Indeed, Tian et al.61 proved that ligand-free lanthanide-doped nanoparticles are cytotoxic
because of the cellular adenosine triphosphate deprivation of cells.
These UC nanoparticles induced cell death through autophagy and apoptosis
because of the interactions between the particles and phosphate groups.
They concluded that the best practice is to limit the concentration
of the UC nanoparticles below 100 μg mL–1,
which is high enough to ensure proper cell imaging and still far below
the EC50 here obtained after 24 h.

The NIR response,
aqueous dispersity, biocompatibility, and low
cytotoxicity reported here indicate that the chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanohybrids may be useful as a promising bioprobe for
the imaging of tissues with minimal cell damage.62 Additionally, recent studies have shown that the plasmonic
upconverting coupling at the nanoscale may induce photothermal effects
by direct laser irradiation through luminescence resonance emission
transfer from NaYF4:Yb,Er to Au.63 This photon transfer behavior also makes these hybrid nanoparticles
interesting for exploiting hyperthermia therapy.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have shown the fabrication of biocompatible chitosan-functionalized
optical nanocomposites based on near-infrared-sensitive upconverting
nanoparticles. Hydrophobic NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal nanorods
synthesized by hydrothermolysis were used as a photon upconverter.
Water-soluble chitosan was prepared by acetylation of native chitosan
nanofibrils and used to functionalize the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals
into biocompatible optical nanomaterials. The novelty of the aqueous
solubility and polymorphs led water-soluble chitosan to serve as a
stabilizer, gel matrix, and spherical support for the upconverting
nanomaterials. This homogeneous combination allowed us to design the
upconverting nanocomposites with different structures of aqueous colloid,
aerogel, microsphere, and hybrid. The simultaneous integration of
NIR response and biocompatibility endows the optical materials with
biofunctionality, as we have demonstrated the low cytotoxic response
of the chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites.
These novel materials are useful for extended studies in biomedicine,
bioimaging, drug delivery, and analytical sensing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Er Upconverting
Nanocrystals
An aqueous basic mixture of ionic coprecursors
(lanthanide and fluoride with the desired concentration) and 0.23
g of NaOH, 4.73 g of oleic acid, 6.6 mL of ethanol, and 1.0 mL of
water was prepared under vigorous stirring until a translucent solution
was obtained. The reaction mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined
autoclave and heated to 190 °C. After the hydrothermal treatment
for 24 h, the white product that precipitated out of the mixture was
collected at the bottom of the autoclave. The product was washed with
ethanol and harvested by centrifugation to obtain OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er upconverting nanocrystals. Hexagonal rod-shaped nanocrystals
were formed using lanthanide nitrates (150 mg of Y(NO3)3, 108 mg of Yb(NO3)3, and 11 mg of Er(NO3)3) and 116 mg of NaF, whereas the 2-fold increased
precursor concentration formed cube-/rod-shaped nanocrystals.

4.2 Preparation of Water-Soluble Chitosan
Chitin was chemically
purified from crab shells by deproteinization
and decalcification. The purified chitin (∼25 g) was treated
at least twice with a concentrated NaOH aqueous solution (50 wt %,
500 mL) at 90 °C for 8 h to obtain chitosan flakes. The prepared
chitosan was immersed in ethanol to remove adsorbed water. The dried
chitosan (∼5 g) was added to 40 mL pure acetic anhydride to
perform acetylation at room temperature within 4 h. The acetylated
chitosan was collected from the reaction solution by filtration, dabbed
with tissue paper, and washed quickly with distilled water to remove
adsorbed acetic anhydride. The resulting samples were immersed in
water to make them swell and then dissolved into a homogeneous chitosan
aqueous solution.

4.3 Preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Er/Chitosan
Aerogel Composites
OA-capped NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal
nanorods (∼60 mg) were dispersed in 20 mL of water-soluble
chitosan (∼3 wt %) in the presence of 0.5 mL of glyoxal to
form a homogenous mixture after stirring for 1 h. The reaction mixture
was hydrothermally treated at 80 °C for 6 h to crosslink chitosan
by glyoxal. Upon thermal crosslinking, gelation of the reaction mixture
occurred, forming hydrogel composites. The resulting hydrogels were
freeze-dried to recover NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan aerogel composites.

4.4 Preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Er/Chitosan
Microsphere Composites
An aqueous-in-oil microemulsion system
was designed to prepare NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan microsphere
composites. The aqueous phase is ∼2 mg of NaYF4:Yb,Er
nanorods/1.25 mL of water-soluble chitosan (∼3 wt %)/0.1 mL
of glyoxal, whereas the oil phase is 1.25 g of Span 80/30 mL paraffin.
These phases were mixed together in a flask reactor, forming a cloudy
emulsion system after stirring and sonication. The flask reactor was
sealed and heated at 80 °C to crosslink chitosan by glyoxal within
48 h. The solidified microspheres were collected by adding 40 mL hexane
into the microemulsion, followed by centrifugation. The white solidified
product of NaYF4:Yb,Er/chitosan microsphere composites
was washed with ethanol and dispersed in water.

4.5 Preparation of Chitosan-Stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er
Nanocomposites
OA-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er hexagonal
nanorods (∼5 mg) were added to 20 mL of ethylene
glycol containing 0.01 mg of HAuCl4. The reaction mixture
was stirred for 1 h and then hydrothermally treated at 80 °C
under stirring for 20 h to form a purple solution. These nanocomposites
were collected and purified with Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites
with ethanol and then added to water-soluble chitosan (20 mL, ∼1
wt %) under stirring and sonication to form a chitosan-stabilized
Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er aqueous dispersion.

4.6 Cytotoxicity
Assay
Dose-dependent
cytotoxicity of chitosan-stabilized NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles
and chitosan-stabilized Au/NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocomposites after
24 and 72 h was evaluated according to the WST-1 viability assay.
First, the nanoparticles were sterilized by irradiation for 10 min.
Then, they were washed by spinning them down at 1000 rpm for 5 min,
and the resulting solution was replaced with fresh growth media (MEM-α
with glutamax, 1% P/S, 10% fetal bovine serum). DU145 human prostate
cancer cells were then seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration
of 1000 cells/well. After 24 h, media in wells were replaced with
the nanoparticle media solution at various concentrations ranging
from 0.01 to 1 mg mL–1. Positive control wells (100%
viability) were established by adding fresh media to a row of cells,
whereas negative control wells (0% viability) were established by
adding an excessive amount of nanoparticle solution (5 mg mL–1). The EC50 of the cells was determined by plotting relative
cell viability (relative to positive and negative controls in %) in
OriginPro. Each experiment was repeated six times.
