Nickel oxide loaded
on zirconia (NiO/ZrO2) as an expedient catalyst is reported
for the synthesis of 18 unsymmetrical 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives.
The Lewis acidic nature of the catalyst proved an excellent choice
for the one-pot, four-component fusion reaction with excellent yields
of 89–98% and a
completion time of 20–45 min. Mechanistic studies show that
enamine and imine functionalities are the two possible pathways for
the formation of 1,4-dihydropyridines with high selectivity. Crystal
structures of two novel compounds (5a, 5c) were reported. The catalyst demonstrated reusability up to six
cycles. The reaction at room temperature and ethanol as a solvent
make this protocol green and economical.

Introduction
Catalysts play a crucial
role in facilitating product selectivity and decreasing the activation
energy of the reactions.1 Although homogeneous
catalysts show better efficiency in chemo- and regioselectivity and
their reaction mechanisms are better understood, their recovery from
the reaction mixture is often difficult and involves several neutralization
procedures.2 To overcome these drawbacks,
heterogeneous catalysts are more chosen in organic synthesis. Because
of their surface-to-volume ratio, the amount of heterogeneous catalyst
required for the transformation is reduced, enabling the transformation
to become both efficient and economical, and it is easy to separate
from the reaction medium.3 In this context,
mixed metal oxides as heterogeneous catalysts contributed significantly
to organic synthesis because of their tuneable characteristics of
the versatile surface sites.4 The synergy
between active metal and support typically dictates the catalytic
properties of the material.5 In this context,
nickel has been used both as a homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst
in many organic transformations like C–C bond formations, reductive
eliminations including C–N and C–O bond formation reactions,
and cross-coupling reactions.6 Zirconia
has attracted more interest than other support materials because of
its higher tolerance toward corrosion and high temperatures,7 as demonstrated by the use of ZrO2 in the heat shield of space shuttles. Moreover, zirconia gained
importance as a catalyst due to its surface properties by possessing
both acidic and basic sites. The surface properties can be modified
by loading/doping with suitable metals.8,9 Based on these
advantages, we prepared materials with different loadings of Ni on
ZrO2 support and investigated their efficacy as a reusable
catalyst for selective organic transformation. Previous reports demonstrated
the use of NiO/ZrO2 as a catalyst for simple conversions
such as oxidative dehydrogenation10 and
C–S cross-coupling reactions.11 This
is the first report of using NiO/ZrO2 as a catalyst in
a multicomponent, one-pot reaction system.

Multicomponent reactions
(MCRs) are important synthetic tools with the ability to craft complex
organic molecules with high atom economy. An MCR is an ecofriendly
means to synthesize libraries of biologically important scaffolds.12 Among the heterocyclic compounds, N-heterocyclic scaffolds in general acquired more prominence in the
medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. In particular, 1,4-dihydropyridines
(1,4-DHPs) are scaffolds of biological importance13 as antimicrobial,14 antitubercular,15 anticancer,16 anticoagulant,17 neuroprotector,18 antioxidant,19 L/T-type
calcium channel blocking,20 AChE inhibiting,21 and bone anabolic agents.22 1,4-DHPs were first reported by Hantzsch in 1882 via the
multicomponent reaction of aromatic aldehyde, β-ketoester, and
ammonia as nitrogen sources.23 Well-known
commercial drugs like felodipine, diludine, and nifedipine constitute
1,4-DHPs as the core moiety (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of commercially available 1,4-dihydropyridine
drugs.

Due to the vast biological and synthetic importance
of 1,4-DHP derivatives, several protocols have been reported via a
one-pot strategy and employing different catalysts like nano-tungsten
trioxide-supported sulfonic acid (n-WSA),24 sulfated boric acid nanoparticles,25 chitosan-supported
copper(II) sulfate,26 Fe3O4@SiO2@Si-(CH2)3@melamine-picolineimine@SO3H,27 sulfated polyborate,28 Fe3O4/KCC-1/BPAT,29 chitosan-supported vanadium oxo,30 magnetic guanidinylated chitosan,31 nano-ZrO2-SO3H (n-ZrSA),32 Gd(OTf)3,33 nicotinic acid,34 γ-Fe2O3/Cu@cellulose,35 SBA-15@AMPD-Co,36 sulfamic acid,19 Fe3O4@D-NH-(CH2)4-SO3H,37 Cu-adenine@boehmite,38 hydromagnesite,39 Cu(OTf)2,40 ascorbic acid,41 NS-C4(DABCO-SO3H)2·4Cl,42 CBr4,43 and aminated CNTs.14 Many of these methods
either suffer from usage of reflux conditions, lower yields, or long
reaction times.

We report for the first time NiO/ZrO2 as a reusable catalyst in a one-pot four-component fusion reaction
for the synthesis of novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives at room
temperature. We also report significant advances into the proposed
mechanism based on the reaction intermediates, including a single-crystal
structure.

Results and Discussion
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Figure 2 shows the X-ray
diffraction pattern of 2.5 wt % NiO–ZrO2 and the
diffraction peaks (2 theta) from 0 to 80°. The major diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 24.5, 27.8, 31.3, 35.4, 40.5, 50.3, 54.4, 55.6,
57.8, 59.9, 65.4, and 71.2° for ZrO2 are correlated
with the international standard file (JCPDS 37-1484). The NiO peaks
are displayed in the XRD diffractogram at 2θ = 37.2, 45.3, 62.8,
71.3, and 75.5° were further matched with the standard file (JCPDS
47-1049). The diffraction pattern revealed the polycrystalline nature
of the prepared catalytic material.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis
The TEM
investigation was performed to explore the catalyst morphology. Figure 3 illustrates a distinctive
TEM image NiO/ZrO2 (2.5 wt %). The image indicated an irregular
cubic morphology with nominal agglomeration of NiO. It was further
observed that the black irregular-shaped nickel oxide particles are
evenly distributed on the surface of oval-shaped zirconia particles,
which may improve catalytic activity.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Analysis
The surface
morphology of 2.5 wt % NiO/ZrO2 was assessed by SEM, which
is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows
the irregular-round particles aggregated on the surface of ZrO2. The surface was further analyzed by mapping and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 4b,c), which show the even distribution of Ni on the
surface of zirconia.

Surface Area Analysis
The 2.5 wt % NiO/ZrO2 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm illustrated in Figure 5 shows a type-IV
adsorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop of H2, which
is a characteristic of a mesoporous material (p/po range of 0.67–0.98). The surface area
is 76.35 m2 g–1 with a pore volume of
0.29 cm3 g–1 and a pore size 12.14 nm.

Pyridine IR
The nature of the
surface active sites was examined by ex-Pyridine IR.44 Pyridine is widely used as a probe to characterize the
surface acidity of the materials. Pyridine as a base interacts with
Brønsted acid sites and through H+ transfer lead to
the formation of pyridinium ion. Pyridine can act as a Lewis base,
and it is capable to donate a pair of electrons toward the electrophilic
Lewis acidic sites. Such characteristic bands are perceived in the
range of 1550–1400 cm–1. Based on this, the
characteristic peak at 1448 cm–1 corresponds to
the Lewis acidic sites with bands at 1481 and 1531 cm–1 that correspond to the Lewis + Brønsted and Brønsted acidic
sites, respectively. Figure 6 confirms that the catalyst possesses prominent Lewis acidic
sites, which could facilitate its catalytic activity.

Reaction Optimization
The catalytic efficiency
of prepared NiO/ZrO2 toward the title multicomponent reaction
was evaluated. The reaction was performed by taking four components,
2,3,4-OMe benzaldehyde (1a), ethyl acetoacetate (2) cyclohexanone
(3), and ammonium acetate (4) in the same molar ratio (Scheme 1). In separate studies, the
effects of various catalysts, the amount of catalyst, and role of
solvents were examined. Initially, the reaction was studied under
neat conditions at room temperature and reflux up to 8 h. Only a trace
amount of product was obtained. Next, the effect of different homogeneous
catalysts and organic or inorganic bases such as triethyl amine (TEA),
pyridine, DABCO, NaOH, and K2CO3 were explored
on the title reaction at room temperature (RT) conditions (5–7
h) and
low yields were observed (Table 1, entries 3–7). For comparison, further studies conducted with acidic catalysts AcOH, FeCl3, PTSA, and TFA gave moderate yields in 4–6 h (Table 1, entries 8−11). Different heterogeneous
metal oxides like SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 (normally used as support materials) were explored
under the same reaction conditions. SiO2 gave 53% yield,
Al2O3 gave 60% in 3.5–4 h time, ZrO2 gave a higher yield of 68% in 2 h time, and NiO gave 65%
in 2.5 h time (Table 1, entries 12–15). Considering the interesting results from
NiO and ZrO2, to identify the efficient catalyst, the scope
of various ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts, 2.5 wt % CuO/ZrO2, CeO2/ZrO2, and NiO/ZrO2 (Table 1, entries
16–18) were investigated. An impressive yield of 98% was observed
with 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 in a relatively short time of 20 min
compared to 73% in 60 min with 2.5% CuO/ZrO2 (Table 1, entry 16) and 81%
yield in 45 min (Table 1, entry 17) with 2.5% CeO2/ZrO2. While using
1% NiO/ZrO2 catalyst yielded 91% product in 30 min under
similar conditions (Table 1, entry 19), 5% NiO/ZrO2 led to a slight decreased
yield (94%) in 25 min (Table 1, entry 20). Therefore, 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 was the preferred
catalyst for further studies. The higher catalytic activity may be
due to the even distribution of the active material on the surface
of the support and availability of more optimally active NiO sites
in combination with ZrO2, which help in speeding up the
rate of reaction selectively compared to 1 and 5% catalyst. For the
1% NiO/ZrO2 catalyst loading, the particles are small and
have a high surface area but less number of active sites compared
to the 2.5% NiO/ZrO2, whereas for 5% NiO/ZrO2 loading, the nickel particles are visibly larger and hence have
a smaller surface area, thus slightly lower yield when compared to
the 2.5% NiO/ZrO2. Hence, 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 acts
as a good promoter for the present transformation.

To further
optimize the conditions, we examined the role of the solvent in the
organic conversion employing different nonpolar and polar solvents
(Table 2). In the presence
of nonpolar solvents like n-hexane and toluene at RT, no product was
identified even after 4 h possibly due to the poor solubility of the
reactants. Among the polar solvents such as DMF, THF, MeCN, EtOH,
and MeOH, the highest yields were observed with EtOH.

Next,
the required amount of catalyst for the reaction was optimized. Results
are summarized in Table 3 and show that the yields of products increased with the increase
in amount of catalyst from 10 to 30 mg. There was no increase in the
yield with >30 mg. To broaden the viability and scope of the method, 18 substituted 1,4-dihydropyridines were synthesised employing the optimized conditions, of which 12 were novel derivatives.
All of the 18 derivatives gave excellent yields in a relatively short
time of ≈45 min, and the results are summarized in Figure 7. The structures
of all synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 15N spectroscopy and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses. The single-crystal X-ray structures
of 5a and 5c are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. Table 4 shows the crystal data, and further information is incorporated
in the Supporting Information (page S3).

The heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) interactions
of trial reaction 5a are shown in Figure 10. In the 1H NMR spectra, the
distinguishing singlet peaks at δ = 2.18, 3.67, 3.70, 3.77,
4.98, and 8.99 indicate the presence of −CH3, −OCH3, −CH, and −NH protons. The selected HMBC interactions
of 5a are a definite proof for the product formation.
The −CH proton in the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring was assigned
to the peak at δ = 4.98, and it further interacted with carbon
atoms at δ = 18.04, 103.90, 110.54, 124.53, 133.18, 151.41,
167.28, and 194.25. The singlet peak at δ = 8.99 was attributed
to the −NH proton in the dihydropyridine ring, which further
interacts with the carbon atoms at δ = 18.04, 26.29, 110.54,
103.90, 143.42, 167.28, and 194.25. The HRMS showed the m/z = 400.1770 [C22H27NO6-H+], which corresponds well with the theoretical
value for 5a.

Insight
into the Mechanism
To examine the mechanism of the present
reaction, an attempt was made to identify the reaction intermediates
by analyzing the reaction mixture after 10 min (Figure 11). Characterization relied
on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) studies
and was based on peaks identified at 112 and 130 corresponding to
the presence of enamine, the peak at 309 corresponding to imine, and
the peak at 291 to the existence of a Knoevenagel condensation transient
intermediate. Based on experimental observations, the generation of
the final product is proposed to occur through two pathways: (i) by
enamine and (ii) by imine, which is supported by the literature reports.45,46 In the proposed scheme, the key intermediates in the reaction are
designated as (6), (7), (8), and (9). It
is assumed that
for the formation of a knoevenagel intermediate47 between 2,3,4-OMe benzaldehyde (1) and 1,3-cyclohexanedione (2), Lewis acidic sites present on the surface plays a key
role, which can activate the carbonyl group of aldehyde and make it
electrophilic to form an intermediate (a) and then react
with nucleophilic 1,3-cyclohexanedione (2), which further
will dissociate from the catalyst surface by taking a proton from
the solvent ethanol to give the intermediate (b) and
to give (6) upon further dehydration. Similarly, (7) is also formed by the same procedure with the reaction
of ethyl acetoacetate through the intermediate (c). Furthermore,
ammonium acetate (4) acts as a nitrogen source to further
dissociate to ammonia (4a). The enamine intermediates (8) and (9) are formed by the reaction of ammonia (4a) with (2) and (3) on the catalyst
surface. Enamine (8) possibly reacts with (7) and undergoes Michael addition to give the key structure (11). The ring closure of (11) leads to the formation intermediate (12), which undergoes dehydration, finally yielding the stable
product, 5a. Similarly, the enamine (9) upon
reaction with (6) gives (13) via Michael
addition and subsequent ring closure generates intermediate (14), which upon dehydration offers 5a. The enamine (9) reacts with (1) to give an imine intermediate (10), which further reacts with (2) to give (13). Further ring closure provides the intermediate (14) followed by dehydration, which gives 5a (Scheme 2). The comparative
catalytic efficiency of the 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 with other reported
catalysts is given in Table 5.

Moreover, green metrics calculations for a series
of synthesized 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives were performed (Table S1, page S50). For the proposed method,
the calculated atom economy and atom efficiency ranges from 74.1 to
83.2%, which are below 100% due to the loss of three H2O molecules and one acetate ion as byproducts, and E factors ranging from 0.26 to 0.44 g/g are also validated and indicate
the good green credential of the present protocol. The other green
metrics are shown in Table S1, page S50
(Supporting Information).

Reusability
of the Catalyst
To examine the catalyst stability, recyclability
experiments were conducted. After every run, the catalyst was recovered
from the reaction mixture, washed with ethanol, and dried at 120 °C
for 2 h. For the first six cycles, the catalyst proved efficient and
the activity was retained with no loss. Afterward, the
material catalytic activity decreased in the seventh cycle (Figure 12). To examine the
heterogeneity of the used 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 catalyst, a hot
filtration method was employed for the synthesis of 5a. Ten minutes after the start of the reaction, the catalyst was removed
from the reaction mixture through centrifugation and the remaining
reaction mixture was kept under the same stirred condition to monitor
the reaction progress. Even after 60 min, no reaction or increase
in the product yield was observed (Figure 13). From the above result, it shows that
the catalyst leaching is very low. Furthermore, the catalyst after
the reaction was analyzed by XRD and TEM incorporated (Figure S1). The XRD pattern of the reused material
is much similar to that of the fresh one; furthermore, from the TEM
image of the reused catalyst, there is as much similar to that of
the fresh one, which indicates that there is no such erosion of the
active material from the support, which shows the presence of the
heterogeneous nature of material.

NiO/ZrO2 catalyst for the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine 5a.

filtration test results of 2.5% NiO/ZrO2 catalyst for 5a. Reaction conditions: 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (1 mmol)
(1), ethyl acetoacetate (1 mmol) (2), 1,3-cyclohexadione (1 mmol)
(3), and ammonium acetate (1 mmol) (4); 5 mL of EtOH; and stirring
at RT.

Conclusions
We introduced NiO/ZrO2 as an efficient
and cost-effective catalyst for the synthesis of 12 novel 1,4-dihydropyridine
derivatives in a four-component, one-pot strategy. This method proved
effective toward the reaction of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic
aldehydes obtained with high yields. ESI-MS/MS studies are conducted,
and insights into the mechanism of the reaction are proposed, which
revealed that 1,4-DHPs mainly follow the enamine and imine pathways.
We anticipate that this catalytic system will find further applications
in both academic and industrial fields, and the prepared series of
1,4-DHPs may provide potential biological activity in the area of
pharmaceutical sector.

Experimental
Section
Catalyst Preparation
A series of nickel oxide-loaded zirconia (NiO/ZrO2) catalysts
with different weight percentages (1, 2.5, and 5 wt %) of Ni were
prepared by the wet impregnation method. A mixture of zirconium oxide
(ZrO2, 2 g, Alfa Aesar) and appropriate amount (wt %) of
nickel sulfate (NiSO4·6H2O, Alfa Aesar)
in 60 mL of deionized water was stirred for 7 h at room temperature.
The resultant slurry was filtered under vacuum and dried at 100 °C
for 6 h, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 6 h in the presence
of air, to obtain different weight percents of NiO/ZrO2. Instrumentation details are included in the Supporting Information (page S2).

General Method for the Synthesis of Series of 1,4-Dihydropyridine
Derivatives (5a–r)
For the synthesis
of a series of 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives, the reaction was performed
in a 25 mL round-bottom flask containing 5 mL of EtOH as a solvent.
To these equimolar quantities of substituted aldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate,
ammonium acetate, and 1,3-cyclohexadione, was added 30 mg of NiO/ZrO2 and stirred at room temperature (RT) (Scheme 3). TLC was used to monitor the progress of
the reaction at regular time intervals. After completion of the reaction,
the catalyst was filtered by adding excess ethanol. The solvent was
then evaporated, and the pure product was afforded by recrystallization
from EtOH. The details and spectra are given in the Supplementary
Information (pages S5–S12 and S13–S49).
