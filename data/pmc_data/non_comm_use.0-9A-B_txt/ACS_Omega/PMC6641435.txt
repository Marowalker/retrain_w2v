Superabsorbent hydrogels are significant
not only in materials
science but also in industries and daily life, being used in diapers
or soil conditioners as typical examples. The main feature of these
materials is their capacity to hold considerable amount of water,
which is strongly dependent on the cross-linking density. This study
focuses on the preparation of hydrogels by reweighing the effect of
cross-linking density on physical properties, which provides green
fabrication of bilayered hydrogels that consist of homogeneous structural
motifs but show programmed responses via sequential radical polymerization.
In particular, when two hydrogel layers containing different cross-linking
densities are joined together, an integrated linear bilayer shows
heterogeneous deformation triggered by water. We monitor the linear
hydrogel bilayer bending into a circle and engineer it by incorporating
disperse dyes, changing colors as well as physical properties. In
addition, we demonstrate an electric circuit switch using a patterned
hydrogel. Anisotropic shape change of the polyelectrolyte switch closes
an open circuit and lights a light-emitting diode in red. This proposed
fabrication and engineering can be expanded to other superabsorbent
systems and create smart responses in cross-linked systems for biomedical
or environmental applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Since poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate) was reported to form a
hydrogel in the presence of a cross-linker,1 a myriad of hydrogels have been widely researched for biomedical
and environmental purposes. Among them, superabsorbent hydrogels (SHs)
confine considerable amount of water into a three-dimensional, cross-linked
network, which is typically greater than hundreds to thousands times
their dry weight, and swell while maintaining the original shape.2−4 Acrylic acid (or acrylate) and acrylamide are extensively used as
monomers, along with other monomers such as N-isopropylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, and more interestingly,
bioextractable sodium 4-hydroxy-2-methylenebutanoate5 or polymers including poly(vinyl alcohol), which are further
cross-linked covalently or noncovalently in situ or ex situ.2,6 When exposed to aqueous conditions, hydrophilic groups in the polymer
network are primarily hydrated by water molecules, and then, the additional
water can be absorbed via capillary force and osmotic pressure for
filling the space inside the network. Such wet materials essentially
possess small yet functionally crucial cross-linking density, which
not only leads to water absorbency but also modulates the physical
properties of the entire material on demand, for example, elasticity
or swelling ratio.

The versatility of SHs has offered privileged,
sustainable applications.
For instance, from the perspective of polymeric materials, swellable
materials have been used as elastomers, watery matrices, containers,
supports, and films, which can be further applied in many fields such
as soil conditioning, tissue engineering, desalination, catalysis,
and health care.6 In particular, stimuli-responsive
SHs have gained notable interest because of the following characteristics:7−21 (i) bio- and environmental compatibility, (ii) wide range of functional
monomers/building blocks including cost-effective natural products
(e.g., cellulose, alginate, starch, chitosan, polysaccharides, and
proteins), (iii) possible use of water as an eco-friendly ubiquitous
stimulus, (iv) use of a broad library of well-established chemistry
for synthesis, for example, radical polymerizations, (v) distinguishable
volumetric change, and (vi) processability into smart composites integrated
with inorganic components that render synergy effects via hybridization.
Besides, responsive SHs have been remarkably used as a hydrogel actuator
under aqueous conditions. The materials show reconfigurable shape
changes in response to pH,22 temperature,23−25 salinity,26 metal ions,27,28 light,29 or electric potential,30,31 taking one step forward to biomimetic responses.

In this study,
we demonstrate a green fabrication method of bilayered
hydrogels that show heterogeneous deformation under aqueous conditions
by controlling the cross-linking density. The bilayer structure consists
of homogeneous chemical species (i.e., cross-linked poly(acrylic acid))
and enables low-cost effort-saving fabrication through sequential
radical polymerization in water without the need of ancillary adhesives—eliminating
possible interfacial complexity that raises the outbreak of debonding.
Instead, only the gap in cross-linking density significantly alters
the physical properties of hydrogels, building up programmed responses
of the bilayer. Therefore, we evaluate the effect of cross-linking
density on superabsorbency, mechanical strength, and thermal stability
of hydrogels, which allows a controlled deformation triggered by water.
As designed, the bilayered hydrogel curls into a circle when wet;
the behavior is dependent on pH. Each layer can be colored with disperse
dyes for visual clarity, and the bilayer exhibits material properties
emanating from both layers. Furthermore, we prepare a circuit switch
using a patterned hydrogel. A small firmly cross-linked hydrogel patch
induces enough hydraulic force to bend the loosely cross-linked hydrogel
strip, which closes the circuit and switches on a light-emitting diode
(LED).

Results and Discussion
Fabrication of a Hydrogel Film from a Glass
Template via Radical
Polymerization
Figure 1 shows the synthetic procedure of a poly(acrylic acid)-based
hydrogel film under aqueous conditions by radical polymerization.
First, acrylic acid (14 mL) was added to water (8 mL). Two phases
were separated initially, but 80% neutralization with NaOH gave a
homogeneous solution with a molar concentration of 8 mM. Then, di(ethylene
glycol) acrylate (cross-linker) and potassium persulfate (KPS) (initiator)
were added to provide a ready-to-polymerize solution, which was transferred
by a syringe to a glass template having a rectangular space inside
(11.5 cm × 15 cm × 0.1 cm) for polymerization. The template
had a high ratio of surface area to volume and could facilitate efficient
heat transfer, which is similar to controlling autoacceleration process
in the sheet-type mold. After the displacement, the monomer solution
was polymerized on a heating plate at a set temperature of 55 °C
for 2 h; the cross-linked hydrogel film was obtained and unloaded
from the mold. The soft film was even and transparent without the
inclusion of severe cavitation and had a size similar to that of the
template. The chemical structure of the hydrogel is shown in the inset
of Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic description
for the preparation of a poly(acrylic acid)-based
hydrogel film. The neutralized monomer was polymerized in a glass
template. The transparent hydrogel film obtained and its cross-linked
chemical structure are shown in the inset.

Effect of Cross-Linking on the Swelling Properties
A poly(acrylic
acid) film dramatically absorbs water and shows a
distinct size expansion while maintaining its initial shape. During
swelling, the diacrylate cross-linker in the hydrogel films fundamentally
affected the superabsorbency. As shown in Figure 2a, we prepared hydrogel films 1–6 containing different amounts of cross-linker
under the same conditions, wet the films with deionized water, and
expressed the effect of cross-linker on the absorbency by calculating
the degree of swelling (eq 1) and cross-linking density (ρ) (eq 2) as follows:32 1  where X indicates the weight
of the wet analyte sample and X0 is the
weight of the sample dried under vacuum using a lyophilizer for 48
h. 2  where Vsol indicates
the molar volume of water; vp is the equilibrium
polymer volume fraction determined from the degree of swelling; and
χ is the solvent–polymer interaction parameter of 0.46.33

Figure 2 (a) Change in degree of swelling of hydrogel films with
regard
to the cross-linker ratio after immersing in water for 48 h (sky blue).
The as-prepared samples contain a limited amount of water (44–47%)
regardless of the ratio (black). (b) Representative volumetric change
in film 2 when prepared and freeze-dried. The black square
(area, 1 cm × 1 cm) helps to estimate the film size. After immersing
in water for 48 h, the swelled film has a side that approximately
measures 3.5 cm. (c) SEM images of as-prepared 2 (up)
and after swelling in water for 48 h (down). Each sample was freeze-dried
for 48 h before the measurement.

The initial as-prepared samples had similar values for degree
of
swelling (44–47%), irrespective of the amount of cross-linker,
because the films were consistently prepared from 0.8 M monomer solutions
in water. However, after drying and re-swelling in water for 48 h,
the hydrogel films showed different swelling ratios, which hinged
on the cross-linking density. Film 2 (0.34 wt % of cross-linker)
swelled for a maximum of 200 times, and then, the value decreased
as more cross-linkers were involved. Figure 2b shows an isotropic dimensional change in 2. The initial film had a side of 1.15 cm, which decreased
by 26% when lyophilized, but exposure to water increased the side
4.1×. The black square behind the hydrogel film indicates the
transparency of the film and supports the size estimation. As expected,
the cross-linking density obtained from eq 2 revealed the inverse proportion against the
swelling ratio of the films, except for the case of 1, which has the least amount of cross-linker. We reason that the
partially soluble loose network of 1 hindered the capillary
force for water absorption.34 In Figure 2c, the example porous
network of 2 was observed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), which was developed after swelling in water. The pore size
ranges from 3 to 20 μm. All experimental values of the obtained
hydrogels are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Degree of Swelling and Cross-Linking
Density of Hydrogel Films 1–6
hydrogel film	cross-linker (wt %)	degree of swelling (%)	cross-linking density (mmol L–1)	
1	0.20	15 912	0.71	
2	0.34	20 164	0.47	
3	0.42	16 287	0.68	
4	0.50	10 011	1.55	
5	0.63	7509	2.54	
6	0.80	7140	2.77	
In addition, we measured the actual
change in the temperature of
the polymerizing solution during radical polymerization. Therefore,
a flexible thermocouple probe was inserted into the polymerizing solution
of 2, which was cast inside the template on a heating
plate (set temperature, 55 °C), and the temperature was tracked
by a digital thermometer, as shown in Figure 3a. The temperature exponentially increased
for the initial 20 min and then slightly elevated more for 15 min,
indicating an accelerated polymerization (Figure 3b). In general, Trommsdorff effect aggravates
undesirable properties in polymeric materials, such as cavitation
or unevenness, during polymerization.35,36 However, the
cast solution of 2 exhibited only a weak exothermic process,
from which the regular hydrogel film 2 was produced.
The maximum temperature was found to be 50.4 °C; thereafter,
the temperature of the film was stabilized at 48 °C until the
end of the reaction.

solution
of 2 in the glass template on a heating plate using a
digital thermometer. (b) Change in the temperature of the solution
during radical polymerization.

Effect of Cross-Linking on the Mechanical Strength of Hydrogels
Chemical cross-linking provides an effective approach to control
the mechanical strength of polymeric materials. Herein, we measured
the stress–strain curves of the resulting films, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the representative
curves for hydrogel samples 1–6,
from which we can anticipate the effect of cross-linking density.
As described in Figure 4b, toughness values increased until the amount of cross-linker increased
from 0.20 (film 1) to 0.34 wt % (film 2)
and then decreased in inverse proportion to the amount of cross-linker.
A similar tendency was observed for elongation at fracture. As an
example, at 0.34 wt %, the toughness of film 2 was found
to be 0.28 MJ m–3 with 300% elongation at fracture.
On the other hand, Young’s modulus only fluctuated within a
narrow range of 0.12–0.15 MPa. Presumably, small change in
cross-linker concentration would manipulate microstructures or induce
microdeformation in hydrogels, leading to a change in ductility of
materials rather than stiffness. We also changed the initiator concentration,
which can control the molecular weight between the cross-links (Mc), another factor affecting the cross-linking
density, during polymerization.37,38 Thus, we polymerized
film 2 using different initiator concentrations. Toughness
increased in proportion to the amount of initiator until 0.56 wt %
of KPS was incorporated (a maximum toughness, 0.40 MJ m–3) and then decreased; in contrast, elongation at fracture decreased
above 0.43 wt % (Figure S1). Although the
total changes were much smaller than the results from the cross-linker
concentration, a detailed future investigation would elaborate complementary
effects of both factors on the mechanical properties of the hydrogel
materials.

from the hydrogels that contain different concentrations of cross-linker
when polymerized with 0.25 wt % KPS. (b) Change in toughness (blue),
elongation at fracture (black), and Young’s modulus (orange,
inset) of the hydrogels with respect to the concentration of cross-linker.
The data points were obtained in quintuplicate from five independent
experiments.

Furthermore, we took 1, 3, and 6 and measured their tensile
strengths at 80 °C to investigate
a thermal effect. At 80 °C, the films stiffened more—toughness
and elastic modulus increased and elongation reduced—as compared
to the measurement at 25 °C (Figure 5a–c). The total exposure time to heat
during testing was less than 2 min. The fractured specimen from 3 (0.42 wt %) was hard and brittle, as shown in Figure S2b. To examine the effect of thermal
treatment on hydrogels, we incubated film 3 at 40, 60,
and 80 °C for 3 and 10 min and tested their mechanical strengths
at the same temperatures (Figure 5d). The longer the exposure time at a higher temperature,
the more rapidly did the Young’s modulus increase, which indicates
that the film hardened by thermal drying. On the other hand, potential
thermal annealing would occur together inasmuch as the modulus gradually
increased even at 40 °C less than the polymerizing temperature.39

are shown for comparison. (d) Change in Young’s modulus of 3 after exposure to different temperatures (40 °C, blue;

in quintuplicate from five independent experiments.

Fabrication of Responsive Hydrogel Bilayers
A minor
modification in the chemical structure (i.e., cross-linking density)
alters the macroscopic physical properties of polymeric materials,
highly encouraging us to develop responsive hydrogels capable of showing
designed behaviors in water. In particular, when two adjacent parts
with different cross-linking densities are joined together, the interface
in between gives rise to heterogeneous deformation of the entire material,
taking advantage of the different swelling ratios in an aqueous medium.
Hence, we have designed and fabricated bilayered hydrogels by sequential
radical polymerization (Figure 6a). In a glass template, we prepared the first layer containing
0.34 wt % cross-linker (film 2). On top, we directly
deposited the second polymerizing solution containing 0.80 wt % cross-linker
(film 5) and polymerized under the same conditions in
the presence of 0.25 wt % KPS. Each polymerizing solution was dyed
with navy blue and red disperse dyes for differentiation before conducting
polymerization. Therefore, in situ polymerization provided a bilayered
structure of hydrogel in which the thickness of the first (navy blue)
and second (red) layers measured 1.2 and 0.8 mm, respectively. The
hydrogel layers adhered tightly to one another because of the probable
interpenetration that would occur at the interface during the second
polymerization reaction. After unloading from the glass mold, the
bilayer was obtained, which had a volume of 2.8 cm × 0.2 cm ×
0.3 cm and displayed an anisotropic shape change.

Figure 6 (a) Fabrication of the
bilayered hydrogel via sequential polymerization.
The first and second layers are prepared from 2 and 5 dyed in navy blue and red, respectively. (b) Change in the
degree of swelling of each colored layer. Swelling behaviors of pristine 2 and 5 are shown for comparison, and the expanded
view of the initial linear region is shown in the inset. (c) Change
in elongation at fracture (black) and Young’s modulus (orange)
of hydrogels when dyed and integrated.

Figure 6b
shows
the change in the degree of swelling of each layer in deionized water,
similarly determined by eq 2. Incorporated with the hydrophobic disperse dyes, the navy
blue 2 and red 5 hydrogels exhibited a total
degree of swelling that decreased in half when fully swelled, compared
to 2 and 5 before dying. The insoluble dyes
also affected the swelling rates of both hydrogel layers, which reduced
from 193 to 177% min–1 for 2 and from
161 to 96% min–1 for 5 after dying,
calculated from the linear slopes of the initial region (inset in Figure 6b). We further swapped
the dyes in the layers, which yielded red 2 and navy
blue 5 films. However, both samples showed less difference
in the swelling ratios, meaning that the bilayer from navy blue 2 and red 5 can better induce the reconfiguration
(Figure S3). Inclusion of the dyes also
altered the mechanical strength of the hydrogel bilayer (Figure 6c). The hydrophobic
dyes enhanced the elongation at fracture of 2 and 5, which could sustain cross-linked structures during the
elongation under tensile stress.40 However,
the bilayer displayed an average elongation at fracture of both hydrogels
as expected, whereas the Young’s modulus did not change much.
Representative stress–strain curves are shown in Figure S4, and the measured values are listed
in Table S5.

A designed behavior
of bilayer is presented in Figure 7. Here, we investigated the
bending of the bilayer in various pHs, which can affect the actuation
of polyelectrolyte materials. Figure 7a shows the bilayer bending in a neutral pH 7 buffer.
As soon as immersed in the buffer, the linear material bent in a round
shape in 15 min, as the navy blue layer (2, 0.34 wt %
cross-linker) that positioned outside swelled more than the red layer
(5, 0.80 wt % cross-linker) inside. A longer exposure
to the medium only increased the whole size of the bilayer to a small
extent but did not unfold the shape (Figure S6). In addition, we investigated the effect of pH on the behavior
of the hydrogel in aqueous media. Figure 7b reveals the change in the curvature of
the deformed hydrogels when exposed to various pHs of 3, 7, and 10.
The curvature of hydrogels autonomously increased as time elapsed.
The curvature increased slightly faster (the rate of folding was found
to be 28.1 m–1 s–1, calculated
from the initial linear region) at pH 3 than that at pH 7 (26.7 m–1 s–1), but the final curvature was
slightly lower than the value resulted from pH 7, accompanying less
folding. Interestingly, the curvature increased most rapidly at pH
10 (rate, 33.6 m–1 s–1; 1.3 times
faster than that at pH 7), and the final curvature reached 224 m–1—the theoretical curvature of a circle that
has 2.8 cm circumference—in 9 min, as shown in the inset of Figure 7b. We assume that
protonation of carboxylates at pH 3 could hinder a complete folding
of the bilayer as decreasing hydrophilicity and water absorbency as
well. However, the remaining acid groups would be deprotonated at
pH 10, which could promote water absorbency and the following folding
behavior while hydrophilicity increased. Time-lapsed photographs of
the bending behavior are presented in Figures S5, S7, and S8. Furthermore, we tested the reversible shape
change of the bilayer that was pre-exposed to pH 10 for 10 min. As
expected, the curled bilayer recovered its original shape after taking
away from water and drying under air for 1 h at 70 °C but bent
again when rewet for 10 min at pH 10. During five drying–rewetting
cycles, the bilayer iterated the programmed response without structural
degeneration (Figure 7c).

25 °C. The linear bilayer curls into a round shape within 15
min. (b) Change in the curvature of the bilayer over time while exposed
to buffer solutions of various pHs (pH 3, orange; pH 7, black; and
pH 10, sky blue). A magnified image of the bilayer folding completely
after immersed at pH 10 for 9 min is shown in the inset. (c) Change
in the curvature of the bilayer during drying–rewetting cycles.
Photographs of the bilayer taken at the third drying–rewetting
cycle were presented.

In addition, we have engineered the hydrogel bilayer through
patterning
with glass masks (Figure 8a). The small glasses masked the first layer (navy blue 2; size, 3 cm × 0.5 cm × 1.3 mm) during the second
polymerization, leaving a small red patch (red 5; size,
0.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.7 mm) on the bottom layer. The small
patch caused the bending of the entire hydrogel in deionized water.
We positioned the patterned hydrogel between two parallel copper plates,
and the hydrogel was held onto the bottom plate with a crocodile clip.
The copper plates were connected to an LED bulb and a dry cell battery,
resulting in an open electronic circuit (Figure 8b). As designed, the hydrogel bending in
deionized water touched the other copper plate 1 cm distant, closing
the circuit. We could see a dim red light before deformation because
the hydrogel contains charged ions, which would diffuse into deionized
water. However, the underwater actuation lit the LED bulb in bright
red in 2 min (Figure 8c).

masks are placed on the first layer in situ before casting the second
polymerizing solution. The first and second layers are prepared from
the same solutions as those used in Figure 6. (b,c) Circuit switch based on the patched
hydrogel (b, open circuit). In deionized water, the bending hydrogel

Conclusions
Bilayered
hydrogels capable of showing programmed responses have
been demonstrated. The hydrogels are made by cross-linking superabsorbent
poly(acrylic acid), where cross-linking density plays a crucial role
in manipulating the swelling behavior as well as mechanical strength.
In particular, engineering cross-linking density provides heterogeneous
deformation when two SHs containing different cross-linking densities
are consolidated via sequential in situ polymerization. Through the
rapid accessible fabrication, we were able to prepare bilayered hydrogels
and colored each layer with disperse dyes. The concomitant physical
changes were investigated. The linear hydrogel bilayer revealed a
pH-dependent folding behavior and showed remarkably fast complete
deformation at pH 10. Furthermore, patterning on the hydrogel brought
about a polyelectrolyte switch that closed the circuit and lit an
LED bulb in red. This fabrication method can be expanded to other
superabsorbent systems using biocompatible monomers, and a merger
with diverse functionalities would expedite the development of cross-linked
polymeric systems that feature smart responses for many biomedical
or eco-friendly applications, for example, microlenses that show a
controlled release or functional membranes that remove specific pollutants
(e.g., microplastics) in the ocean.

Experimental Section
Materials
Acrylic acid, di(ethylene glycol)diacrylate,
and KPS were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Disperse dyes such as Synolon
N/Blue S-GLS (navy blue color) and Synolon Rubine S-GEL (red color)
were purchased from Kimco. Acrylic acid was distilled under reduced
pressure at 50 °C before use. Deionized water was prepared using
a water purification system (Pure Power I+, DAIHAN Scientific). All
other reagents and solvents used were purchased commercially and were
used as received unless otherwise noted.

Analytical Methods
For nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurement, hydrogel sample 2 was prepared in an NMR
tube using D2O instead of water. 1H NMR spectrum
was recorded using a Bruker 300 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C.
Proton chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (ppm, δ
scale) and are referenced to tetramethylsilane ((CH3)4Si, δ 0.00 ppm) or to residual protium in the solvent
(D2O, δ 4.70 ppm). Data are represented as follows:
chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
q = quartet, m = multiplet and/or multiple resonances, and br = broad
peak), integration. Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) was recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25
°C. Carbon chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million
(ppm, δ scale) and are referenced to tetramethylsilane ((CH3)4Si, δ 0.00 ppm). For the tensile test,
the as-prepared hydrogel films were cut using a laser cutter. The
films were glued between two PMMA clamps with a superglue. The resulting
specimens have a size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm (length ×
width × thickness). Uniaxial tensile tests were performed using
an Instron 5543 universal testing machine with a 1000 N load cell
at 25 °C in air. The specimens were stretched at a rate of 5
mm/min until the samples were broken. The elastic modulus and toughness
were calculated from the initial slope (strain range of 10–30%)
and the area under the stress–strain curve, respectively. Each
film type was tested in quintuplicate; the average and standard deviations
from this set were plotted. Micromorphology of the dried hydrogel
film was observed using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. Before the measurement,
the sample was dried using a lyophilizer for 3 d and coated with a
thin platinum layer. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Nicolet-6700
instrument (Thermo Scientific) at room temperature. The spectrum was
obtained by averaging 32 scans over the range of 4000 to 400 cm–1.

Synthesis of a Poly(acrylic acid)-Based Hydrogel
Hydrogel
films were prepared via typical free-radical polymerization. A representative
example of hydrogel 2 was prepared as follows: To a solution
of acrylic acid (14.7 g, 0.204 mol, 1490 equiv) in water (8 mL), sodium
hydroxide (6.6 g, 0.165 mol, 1190 equiv) was added dropwise in water
(16 mL), resulting in 80% neutralization of acrylic acid. The monomer
solution was degassed by vigorous N2 bubbling for 1 h.
After adding KPS (37 mg, 0.14 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 0.25 wt %) and di(ethylene
glycol) diacrylate (50 mg, 0.23 mmol, 1.7 equiv, 0.34 wt %), the reaction
mixture was transferred to a glass template having a size of 11.5
cm × 15 cm × 0.1 cm (width × length × thickness)
and placed on a heating plate having a set temperature of 55 °C
for 2 h. A freestanding hydrogel film was obtained after unloading
from the mold in a quantitative yield. IR (cm–1):
3361, 2932, 2852, 1685.8, 1552, 1405, 1294; 1H NMR (300
MHz, D2O): δ 1.82 (br s, methine protons), 1.23 (br
s, methylene protons); 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O):
δ 183.6, 44.8, 37.3, 36.1. The obtained NMR spectra are shown
in Figures S9 and S10. The amounts of initiator
and cross-linker were varied from 0.05 to 0.75 and from 0.20 to 0.80
wt %, respectively, with reference to the amount of acrylic acid monomer.
For investigating the cross-linker effect (Figure 4), the amount of initiator was set at 0.25
wt %; for the initiator effect (Figure S1), 0.34 wt % cross-linker was used, as shown in Table 2.

Preparation
of Bilayered Hydrogels
Bilayered hydrogels
were prepared by sequential radical polymerization. Di(ethylene glycol)diacrylate
(50 mg, 0.233 mmol, 1.7 equiv, 0.34 wt %), KPS (37 mg, 0.14 mmol,
1.0 equiv, 0.25 wt %), and a navy blue dye (10 mg) were added to 80%-neutralized
acrylic acid (14.7 g, 0.204 mol, 1490 equiv) solution. The first polymerizing
solution was poured into a glass template (11.5 cm × 15 cm ×
0.1 cm), which was covered with a glass lid, and heated at 55 °C
for 2 h to afford the first layer. The second layer was synthesized
onto the first layer in a similar manner. After the fabrication of
the first layer inside the glass template, additional glass slides
(thickness, 0.1 cm) were placed as a spacer. In this step, the first
layer was masked with glass pieces when preparing the patterned bilayer.
The second polymerizing solution was prepared by adding di(ethylene
glycol)diacrylate (119 mg, 0.556 mmol, 4.1 equiv, 0.80 wt %), KPS
(37 mg, 0.14 mmol, 1.0 equiv, 0.25 wt %), and a red dye (10 mg) to
the 80%-neutralized acrylic acid solution. The second solution was
carefully injected into the gap between the first layer and glass
lid and then heated at 55 °C for 2 h. The freestanding bilayer
hydrogel was obtained in a quantitative yield after unloading from
the mold and cut into pieces of desired sizes by using a laser cutter
or razor.
