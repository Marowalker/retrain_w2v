Ultrafast injection-locked amplification
is achieved by sending
femtosecond supercontinuum pulses into a polymeric thin film coated
on a distributed feedback (DFB) microcavity consisting of chirped
gratings. The spatial variation of the grating period led to the resonance
of the DFB microcavity at different wavelengths for injection at different
locations. This enables convenient and continuous tuning of the amplification
spectrum by displacing the grating structures. The large area of the
grating structures enabled large tuning range. The amplified spectrum
can be continuously tuned from 545 to 580 nm through sliding the grating
structures by about 3.5 mm. Sub-1 ps lifetime has been measured for
the amplification process with a net amplification factor as large
as 33. Injection locking enabled high-quality control of the divergence
and transverse mode of the output laser beam.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductors exhibit multifold advantages in their high
efficiency of emission, solution processibility, high flexibility,
integration of thin-film structures into high compact devices, and
broad-band tunability in the emission spectrum. Optically pumped organic
lasers based on distributed feedback (DFB) resonators have been extensively
reported.1−5 Strong optical confinement in the DFB microcavities enabled low-threshold
and high-efficiency operation of the laser device.6−10 However, low output power and large divergence of
the output laser beams make the thin-film organic lasers very limited
in practical applications.

Laser amplification technique is
an effective approach to solve
the above problems. Injection locking cannot only enable achievement
of high-power lasers but also significantly improve the divergence,
the transverse mode, the bandwidth, and the spectroscopic tunability
of the amplification output.11−14 We have recently demonstrated injection-locked amplification
(ILA) of femtosecond laser pulses using DFB microcavities.15,16

In our previous work, efficient amplification of the injected
pulses
was achieved in a femtosecond time scale with the divergence and far-field
transverse mode determined by the injection laser beam.15 However, the tuning range of the amplifier is
very limited due to the strict requirements by the DFB resonance.
Using slant gratings, we have largely extended the tuning range of
the injection-locked amplifier through breaking the strict confinement
in the DFB microcavities based on vertical gratings.16 Slanting the grating lines has not only broadened the tuning
range of the amplifier but also broadened bandwidth of the amplified
spectrum due to the reduction in the confinement strength of the microcavities.

In this work, we demonstrate injection-locked organic thin-film
amplifiers based on DFB microcavities constructed by chirped gratings
with vertically arranged grating lines. In such a design, the optical
confinement strength was not reduced, as compared with an unchirped
DFB grating with a fixed period. However, the tuning range of the
amplifier can be largely extended by spatial variation of the injection
location on the chirped gratings.

2 Design
and Fabrication of Chirped DFB Gratings
Although chirped
gratings have been employed in thin-film laser
devices17,18 based on DFB microcavities, these devices
are all laser oscillators. Femtosecond laser amplifiers using chirped
gratings have not been reported, so far. The amplifiers supply laser
beams with much enhanced power or pulse energy, much reduced laser
beam divergence, and much improved transverse mode quality. Thus,
the laser beam can be conveniently controlled for further application.
In particular, the output spectrum of the amplifier can be also dominantly
controlled by the injection, where the matching between the resonance
of the DFB microcavity, the spatially distributed grating periods,
and the color of the injection laser beam are crucial for the efficient
operation of the amplifier. These performances show advantages of
the amplifiers over the oscillator and the purpose for developing
laser amplifiers. Furthermore, the dynamics of the amplification process
in the femtosecond time scale may reveal more physics for the amplification
processes.

As has been mentioned above, using chirped gratings
will not weaken
the total confinement strength of the DFB microcavities, as compared
with unchirped configurations. This can be confirmed by our theoretical
simulation results on the intensity of the resonance mode of DFB microcavities
based on a normal grating with a fixed period and a chirped grating
with varied periods, as demonstrated in Figure S1. The chirped grating shows a resonance spectrum with its
peak intensity reduced to about 58% with respect to that for a normal
grating. However, the bandwidth is broadened from about 1.6 nm to
about 3.6 nm at full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and the integration
of the emission spectrum is almost the same for both configurations,
implying nearly no reduction in the total efficiency for the energy
confinement.

Figure 1a shows
the design and fabrication method of the chirped grating structures.
A cylindrical lens was inserted into the two-beam interference lithography
scheme, which induces a spatial distribution of the incident angle
(θ1 < θ < θ2). Thus,
the separation angle between the two incident UV laser beams reduces
with increasing the horizontal coordinate value (x). The overlap between the two laser beams on the surface of the
photoresist (PR) layer is shown in the lower panel of Figure 1a. We used a smaller diameter
for laser beam B with a circularly shaped transverse mode and a larger
one for beam A with an elliptical shape, thus chirped gratings were
produced along Y-axis within a overlapped area, as
shown in the lower panel of Figure 1a. A photograph of the finished device is also included
in the lower panel of Figure 1a, which also demonstrates a chirped diffraction pattern.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are shown in Figure 1b, which were measured
on three different sites with a separation distance of 1 mm using
JSM-6510 from JEOL Ltd. The corresponding grating period (Λ)
was increased from 330 to 350 nm, implying a spatial chirp of about
10 nm/mm. In the interference lithography, a UV laser at 360 nm with
a total power of 30 mW was used to perform the exposure, a cylindrical
lens with a focal length of 30 mm was used to converge beam A, a photoresist
AR-P3170 from Allresist GmbH was used as the recording medium, and
a separation angle of θ = 31° was employed in the interference
lithography scheme. The diameter of the effective area of the grating
structures is about 10 mm. The modulation depth of the grating is
about 160 nm, which is basically constant over the whole structure
area.

3 Injection-Locked Organic Amplifier for Femtosecond
Laser Pulses
3.1 Microcavity Laser Resonator/Amplifier Based
on Chirped DFB Gratings
For the thin-film laser oscillators
and amplifiers, the second-order Bragg condition supplies optical
feedback for the intracavity resonance and the first-order supports
the surface-emitting output of the laser resonator or the injection/output
of the amplifier, as has been demonstrated in detail in refs (19−21). The chirped gratings actually supply a series of
DFB microcavities arranged spatially with continuously changed grating
periods. After being coated with an active layer of the laser medium,
each microcavity is a DFB laser oscillator with its intrinsic resonance
defined by the local grating period. This implies a series of DFB
lasers with a continuously tunable emission spectrum.

However,
for the design of amplifiers, the injection laser beam is coupled
into the DFB microcavity through a Bragg diffraction process by neffΛ(x) = λ. Λ(x) is the period of the chirped grating, which is varied
by changing the position (x) and expressed as Λ(x) = Λ0 + γx with
Λ0 and γ denoting the smallest grating period
on one end of the structures and the chirping rate, respectively. neff is the effective refractive index of the
active medium-coated grating system. The injection was then confined
into the DFB microcavity through a second-order Bragg process by 2neffΛ(x) = 2λ, resulting
in a multipass oscillation of the injection in the microcavity and
its efficient interaction with the excited molecules in the active
medium. These mechanisms constitute the amplification processes, which
is dominantly locked by the injection laser pulses in their divergences,
transverse modes, and spectra. Apparently, the resonance wavelength
(λ) can be continuously tuned by changing the period of the
grating (Λ) through adjusting the injection position (x).

In the construction of the organic amplifier,
a light-emitting
polymer semiconductor poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)
(F8BT, from American Dye Sources) was dissolved in chloroform with
a concentration of 23 mg/mL, which was spin-coated onto the chirped
grating structures shown in Figure 1. A rotation speed of 2000 rpm and a duration of 30
s were employed in the spin-coating process, so that F8BT thin film
with a thickness of about 120 nm (measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer
from Ellitop) was produced on the top surface of the chirped grating,
as shown in Figure 2a. F8BT is a typical light-emitting polymer extensively applied in
optically pumped lasers.22−25 The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of F8BT are peaked at about 460 and 540 nm, respectively. In principle,
the physics, the mechanisms, and the design of the amplifiers are
not limited by the conjugated polymer materials. Provided that the
polymer is an efficient emission material, and the emission spectrum
covers the resonance of the DFB microcavity, thin-film amplifiers
can be achieved with an excellent efficiency. This enables a large
extension of the tuning range of the organic thin-film amplifiers
by utilizing different polymer materials with the grating period adjusted
broadly.

Figure 2 (a) Construction of the organic laser amplifier by spin coating
the chirped PR grating with F8BT. (b) The optically pump lasing oscillation
performance with spatial tunability based on the chirped DFB-grating
microcavities.

Before characterizing
the injection-locked laser amplification
performance, we first investigated the device illustrated schematically
in Figure 2a as a laser
oscillator. We pumped using 400 nm laser pulses with a pulse length
of about 150 fs and measured the output spectrum of the laser emission
at different locations (x) along the substrate, as
demonstrated in Figure 2a by λx1, λx2, λx3, etc. The pump laser was focused into a small area on the device.
The detection head of a fiber spectrometer was fixed behind the substrate,
and the spectrum of the laser emission was measured at different pumping
locations by sliding the device along X-axis. Figure 2b shows a series
of lasing spectra as the device was linearly translated in a range
of x = 0–3.3 mm. Each sharp-peaked spectrum
is the lasing emission from a DFB microcavity with a period that can
be taken as a constant at a fixed location of x.
Changing the location of the pumping beam on the chirped grating by
sliding the device, we may achieve another DFB microcavity with a
different period, consequently obtaining a different lasing spectrum.
Thus, the lasing spectrum can be continuously tuned by sliding the
chirped grating along the X-axis. Due to the intensity
distribution of the pump laser beam over the transverse mode and different
lasing thresholds for different DFB microcavities with different periods,
there was a large variation in the intensity of the laser output spectrum.
Therefore, we have normalized the output spectra of the lasing oscillation,
as shown in Figure 2b. With increasing x, the lasing spectrum was tuned
from 551 to 579 nm, corresponding to a tuning speed of about 8 nm/mm
in average. The bandwidth of the lasing spectrum varies from 0.7 to
2 nm at FWHM. Longer wavelength was lasing at a larger grating period,
which is easily understandable by analyzing the Bragg diffraction
condition. The relatively large bandwidth at some locations can be
attributed to the coverage of a chirped grating area by the pump laser
spot as large as 1 mm in diameter, such that the output might be an
overlap of multiple emission spectra.

3.2 Injection-Locked
Femtosecond Amplification
with Spatial Tunability
A femtosecond pump-probe system was
employed in the investigation on the injection-locked amplification
(ILA) process. Femtosecond laser pulses at 800 nm that were produced
from a Ti:sapphire amplifier (Legend Elite from Coherent Inc.) were
frequency doubled by a BBO crystal to produce 150 fs pulses at 400
nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A portion of the 800 nm laser
pulses was sent to a heavy-water cell with a thickness of about 3
mm to produce the supercontinuum pulses extending from about 340–1200
nm, which were used as the injection pulses. It needs to be noted
that the supercontinuum simply supplies a broad band light source,
which can be easily used to replace a tunable light source. Meanwhile,
for the pump-probe system, the supercontinuum is naturally available,
making all experiments much easier. The matching between the grating
period and the injection wavelength can be conveniently achieved,
where a single supercontinuum beam contains all required spectral
components for the injection.

The geometry for the measurements
on the amplification process is presented in Figure 3a, where the injection locking scheme was
introduced, as compared with the laser oscillator in Figure 2a. Injection into the microcavities
at different locations on the chirped DFB gratings leads to the amplification
at different wavelengths. Similar to the laser oscillator, the amplification
at longer wavelengths can be achieved at a larger grating period.
The relationship between all spectra involved in the amplification
process was plotted in Figure 3b by the solid curves. The pump spectrum (blue) centered at
about 400 nm is within a mild absorption region by F8BT (red). The
injection (black) is overlapped with a PL spectrum (dark yellow) in
a broad band within the visible spectrum (450–700 nm), implying
an excellent matching between the material properties and the laser
spectra.

Figure 3 (a) Injection-locked amplification (ILA) scheme for the spatial
tuning of the amplified femtosecond laser pulses. (b) The relationship
between all spectra (solid curves) that are involved in the amplification
processes and the ILA spectrum (solid green circles) constructed by
measuring the peak wavelengths of all of the amplified spectra.

In the experimental studies on
ILA, the thin-film amplifier was
mounted on a linear translation stage. The injection laser beam was
incident along the normal of the substrate of the chirped gratings.
Meanwhile, the pump beam was incident at an angle of about 30°,
which was optimized to achieve the highest amplification and to avoid
coupling of the pump laser into the detection head. Figure 4 shows the amplification dynamics
of the injection supercontinuum pulses at different locations on the
chirped DFB grating. A pump fluence of about 12 μJ/cm2 was employed for all of the measurements. The injection beam was
focused by a curved mirror with a focal length of about 200 mm, so
that the spot size of the injection is roughly 200 μm in diameter
on the grating surface. This enables sufficiently high spatial resolution
for the injection, where there is less than 2 nm changed in the grating
period within the area covered by the injection beam. The solid green
circles in Figure 3b plot the peak wavelengths of amplification spectra at different
locations of the injection beam into the chirped gratings, which constitute
the tuning spectrum of the amplifier ranging from about 545 to 580
nm. Figure 4a–f
shows the amplification spectra at different delays between the pump
and the injection pulses for a relative injection location changed
from X = 0 (Λ ≈ 320 nm) to 3.2 mm (Λ
≈ 352 nm), where corresponding center wavelength was tuned
from 551 to 561, 564, 567, 570, and 577 nm. The delay between the
pump and the injection was changed from 0 to 1 ps. The open circles
show the emission spectrum without injection at each injection location.
Obviously, nearly all of the emission spectra without injection exhibit
lasing peaks, implying that the pump fluence was slightly above the
lasing threshold, and the ILA process is the most efficient when it
is overlapped with the resonance of the DFB microcavity. This also
reveals the regenerative-amplification nature of such an amplification
process.

(f) 577 nm for time delays of 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 ps with comparison
to the emission without injection (open circles). (g) The measured
amplifier output intensity and the amplification factors at different
wavelengths.

Furthermore, we need
to stress that polarization dependence of
both the laser oscillation and amplification output has been observed.
The most efficient laser output has been observed for TE pump and
TE injection, where both the pump and the injection laser beams were
polarized along the grating lines. This is the same as what we have
presented in ref (15) for unchirped gratings. All of the presented spectroscopic data
in this work have been measured using TE pump and TE injection configurations.

One of the most important advantages of the injection-locked amplifiers
is the control and large improvement of the divergence and transverse
mode of the output laser beam. These performances are dominantly determined
by the injection laser beam. As commonly observed for the thin-film
DFB laser oscillators, the output has a very large divergence and
laser beam rapidly spreads into the space, so that it is difficult
to define the laser spot, as shown in Figure S2. However, the divergence of the injection-locked amplifier output
is completely defined by that of the injection beam. The injection
can be an excellently recollimated laser beam with an extremely small
divergence. As shown in Figure S2, the
injection beam diverges very slightly as compared with the output
of the laser emission after propagating in a same distance from the
device.

The amplification factor can be evaluated by calculating
ηA = IILA(λ)/Iin(λ), where IILA and Iin are the intensities of the amplified
and
injected spectra at a peak wavelength of λ, respectively, as
shown by the yellow-filled circles in Figure 4g. The amplification factor varies roughly
in a same rule as the amplification intensity. The intensity spectrum
agrees with the plot by the solid green circles in Figure 3b labeled with “ILA”,
which is located just beside the peak and on the beginning of the
falling edge of the PL spectrum. In Figure 4g, we also present the amplification factor
ηB = IILA(λ)/IOSC(λ), as plotted by the empty circles,
where IOSC is the intensity of the output
spectrum of lasing oscillation without injection at a same pump fluence,
which is peaked at λ. This actually demonstrates how much the
output of the device is enhanced through injection-locked amplification
with respect to that of the laser oscillator. The smallest value of
ηB is 7.14 at 564 nm and the largest is 33.8 at 574
nm. Obviously, stronger lasing intensity above the threshold before
the injection led to a reduction in the amplification factor. The
lasing oscillation processes consume a large amount of the population
on the excited states due to strong stimulated emission processes,
thus reducing the amount of excited molecules that interact with the
injection laser pulses for the amplification processes. The competition
between the amplification and the lasing oscillation processes, the
saturation of the amplification processes, and the mismatch between
the injection and the required in-coupling angle are responsible for
such a reduction.

Figure 5 shows the
amplification dynamics at 551, 557, 562, 568, and 574 nm, when the
temporal overlap between the pump and the injection pulses was adjusted
in the time range of about 5 ps. Fitting the tail of the dynamic curves
shows a lifetime of about 478 fs for the amplification processes at
551, 557, and 562 nm. However, the lifetime was increased to about
783 fs for 568 and 574 nm. A straightforward explanation for such
a difference can be the influence by the length of the DFB microcavities.
Longer wavelength corresponds to larger grating period and longer
microcavity or penetration depth into the gratings, resulting in longer
dwelling time inside the microcavity, thus extending the lifetime
of the ILA process. For understanding the dwelling time, we need to
consider again that the injection pulses were coupled into the microcavity
through a first-order Bragg diffraction, which were confined in the
microcavity in the form of oscillation supported by a second-order
Bragg process. The oscillating pulse traveled back and forth inside
the microcavity for a number of rounds before being coupled out. We
define the time of the round trips of the injection pulse inside the
microcavity as its dwelling time.

Figure 5 Measurements (open circles) on the evolution
dynamics (|ΔA| as a function of delay time)
of the ILA processes at
551, 557, 562, 568, and 574 nm in the time delay range of −1
to 5 ps with exponential decay fittings (solid curves).

As shown in Figure 5, the efficient amplification process was observed
only within the
first 1 ps. This can be understood by considering that the injection
pulse induced strong interaction between the large amount of the injection
photons and the excited molecules during the amplification process,
consuming a large amount of population on the excited states through
stimulated emission and resulting in a rapid reduction in the amplification
efficiency. Therefore, although F8BT has a PL lifetime in nanoseconds,26 the most efficient injection-locked amplification
takes place only within the first 1 ps.

We need to stress that
the amplification performance has been optimized
through adjusting the matching between the DFB resonance modes and
emission efficiency of the active medium. In the fabrication of the
chirped gratings, we have produced a much larger variation range of
the grating period than that has been used and demonstrated. The fabricated
structures cover a total area with a diameter of 10 mm, as shown in Figure 1. However, we have
used a small part of the grating with a diameter of only about 3 mm.
This area has been chosen after the optimization of the period range
of the chirped gratings to obtain the most efficient amplification
spectrum, as shown by the green-filled circles in Figure 3b. We have moved the local
area of the amplifier over the whole structures and fixed the position
of pump-probe scheme when the highest amplification was obtained at
its peak intensity.

Although we have optimized the performance
of the amplifiers through
finding the most efficient area of the chirped grating, we can still
extend the tuning range by adjusting the variation range and variation
rate of the grating period. Thus, each spectral component of the PL
spectrum can find its matching grating period, and the tuning range
can be extended to cover the whole PL spectrum. Furthermore, since
there is no limitation to the organic active materials that can be
applied in such thin-film amplifiers, we can easily tune the amplification
spectrum in the visible or even to the near infrared spectral range
by utilizing different polymers. Additionally, making use of the large-area
structures of the chirped gratings, on a same device, different amplifiers
using different organic semiconductors and different areas of the
chirped gratings can be fabricated on different locations. Thus, using
a single device, multiple amplifiers supply potentials for a large
tuning range of the amplification.

The amplification factor
can be improved by optimizing the geometric
parameters of the gratings, smoothness of the surface of the spin-coated
F8BT layer, and the spatially chirping rate, enhancing the Q factor of the microcavities and consequently the interaction
length between the injected seed pulses and the excited molecules.
The polymer semiconductors have much lower damage threshold than laser
crystals, we used a very mild excitation in the pump-probe measurement
to ensure the validness of the measurement data. This implies that
we still have much space to enhance the amplification factor by increasing
the pump fluence. Balancing the confinement and output of the microcavities
should also be optimized to achieve a larger amplification.

4 Conclusions
We report the injection-locked amplification
of femtosecond laser
pulses using DFB microcavities consisting of chirped gratings spin-coated
with a thin layer of polymeric semiconductor. A large-range tuning
of the amplification spectrum from 545 to 580 nm was achieved through
varying the spatial position of the injection. An amplification factor
ranging from 7.14 to about 33.8 was achieved at different wavelengths.
The divergence and transverse mode of the output of the amplifier
were determined by the injection laser beam. This is potentially important
for the practical applications of organic laser devices.
