Integration
of bicomponents into a greater object or assemblage
is a new avenue to acquire multifunctionality for metal oxide-based
anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report a versatile
means by which precursors serve as self-sacrificing templates to form
architectures of SnO2 phase and other metal oxides. The
vital challenge is the determination of appropriate synthetic system
that can benefit the formation of respective precursors in a structure
or single-source precursors of tin and other metal species. In the
current work, by the aids of synergy action between l-proline
and ethylene glycol (EG), precursors containing two metal ions
are generally fabricated. Adequate flexibility of the present method
has been achieved for SnO2/MxOy hierarchical hybrids, including Mn2O3, Co3O4, NiO, and Zn2SnO4, by calcination of their corresponding SnMn,
SnCo, SnNi, and SnZn precursors, respectively. When evaluated as anode
materials for LIBs, the obtained SnO2/Mn2O3 homogeneous hybrids, as expected, show higher specific capacity
and ultralong cycling stability, gaining a reversible specific capacity
of 610.3 mA h g–1 after 600 cycles with only decay
of 0.29 mA h g–1 per cycle at 1 A g–1 and 487 mA h g–1 after 1001 cycles at a high current
density of 2 A g–1.

Introduction
As one of the excellent
energy storage carriers, lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have drawn extensive attention in the past decades because
of the broad range of applications in mobile electric devices, hybrid
electric vehicles, and smart grids.1−6 To fulfill the higher requirements of these applications, further
improvements in terms of specific capacity and cycling life should
be initiated. Because of their intrinsic limitations in performance,
bulk electrode materials fail to completely meet the ever-growing
demands. It has been widely demonstrated that nanosized anode/cathode
materials enable better rate capability and capacity via reducing
diffusion distances of lithium ions and augmenting the contact area
between the electrolyte and the electrode. In addition, the commercial
graphite anode exhibits a low theoretical capacity (372 mA h g–1),7,8 which cannot keep pace with the
increasing need for energy density of those apparatus with LIB as
a power source. In response, metal oxides with higher theoretical
capacity (e.g., SnO2,9,10 Co3O4,11 MnO2,12−14 Fe2O3,15 and ZnCo2O416) have been emerging
as attractive anode candidates for LIBs. However, they usually show
poor cycling stability and rate capability resulting from low conductivity
and remarkable volume change during the charge/discharge process.9−19 To solve the above issues, it is a useful strategy to assemble two
kinds of metal oxides with nanosize into hierarchical composites.20−22

Recently, such bicomponent hybrids featured with the complex
heterostructure
have been developed and designed to serve as active materials for
LIBs, verifying that these hybrid anodes are furnished with better
lithium storage property (higher specific capacity, better cycling
stability, etc.) than any corresponding counterparts.20−22 From the viewpoint of structural modeling, one representative pattern
is that two components heterogeneously dispersed in the structure
and can be clearly differentiated due to their definite boundary between
each other, such as ZnO@α-Co(OH)2 core–shell
structures featured by ZnO spheres as core and α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets as shell23 and α-Fe2O3/SnO2 heterostructures24,25 consisting of SnO2 nanowire stem with sixfold α-Fe2O3 nanorod branches and SnO2 nanosheet
base growing with branched Fe2O3 nanorods. Two
steps are versatilely applied to sequentially generate the two components
or precursors into such hybrid architectures with one material as
matrix for the growth of another. Another appealing motif is the homogeneous
dispersion of components in the entire heterostructure.26−28 The Yuan group reported the ZnO/ZnFe2O4 submicrocubes
constructed with well-dispersed subunits of two oxides by calcination
of Prussian blue analogue of Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 cubes, demonstrating better electrochemical Li storage performance.26 CoO/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites
had been derived from CoFe-layered double hydroxides, exhibiting a
tunable lithium storage property by changing the ratio of the component
metal oxides.27 In the connection, one
of the challenging issues is to obtain single-resource precursors
involving two active metals. Despite great efforts, the effective
and general synthesis was largely prohibited by the difficulty of
epitaxial growth of the second kind of materials or the limited range
of such single sources of bimetal precursors as Prussian blue. Moreover,
the aforementioned composites cannot tolerate long cycling at higher
current density, probably pertaining to the lack of proper conjoint
components. Therefore, efficient coupling of bimetals in a versatile
synthetic system should be initiated immediately targeted at high-performance
anode materials for LIBs.

Motivated by the advantages of bioxide
composites, the general
one-pot synthesis of such hybrids was realized in our work by picking
a suitable couple of solvent and ligand. This was the first time to
enable the architectures of nanosized SnO2 phase and other
oxides including Mn2O3, Co3O4, NiO, and Zn2SnO4. By rationally picking
up the powerful linker and solvent to conjugate tin and other metal
species, hierarchical structures composed of single- or double-source
precursors were obtained depending on the intrinsic property of metal
ions, which played the key role in the synthesis of bioxide composites.
Particularly, SnO2/Mn2O3 hierarchial
hybrids (HHs) consisted of nanosheet networks attached to the nanorod
stem. When SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs worked
as the anode materials for LIBs, a reversible capacity of 487 mA h
g–1 was maintained even after a long 1000 cycles
at a high current density of 2 A g–1, which was
much better than SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods
and pristine Mn2O3. The origin of performance
elevation could be attributed to the synergistic effect of nanohybrid,
structural interface, and void among the nanosheets. This strategy
displays adequate versatility for architectures of advanced oxide-based
hybrid anodes for LIBs and supercapacitors.

Results and Discussion
The overall
morphology and structure are investigated by the field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) technique. Figure 1a demonstrates a
high yield of the SnMn precursor. To be more detailed (Figure 1b,c), some assemblages
bind to the submicrorod stem similar to agaric growing on trees. Thereinto,
submicrorods are about 5–10 μm in length. Moreover, these
assemblages are assembled with interconnected nanosheets, leaving
significant voids. According to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
result (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), the precursor was annealed above 500 °C to transform completely
into SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs. As shown in Figure 1d–f, the morphology
and structure of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs inherited
well from the paternal template.

and SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs (d,e). Scale bar:
(a) 10 μm, (b) 1 μm, (c) 500 nm, (d) 10 μm, (e)
1 μm, and (f) 500 nm.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique was
applied
to visualize the detailed structure information. In Figure 2a,b, for SnMn precursor, it
is clearly exhibited that the thin nanosheets constitute flowerlike
clusters which are grown on the submicrorod stem. The TEM images of
SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs are displayed in Figure 2c,d, demonstrating
the structural feature inherent from their precursors. The high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image of Figure 2e is used to detect the crystalline nature of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs. Furthermore, the faster Fourier
transformation electron diffraction (FFT-ED) pattern was recorded
from the square area of Figure 2e, exhibiting the well-defined diffraction spots. After calculation
and analysis, the sets of diffractions are indexed to be (020) and
(211) of cubic Mn2O3 with lattice spacings of
0.47 and 0.39 nm, respectively. Another HRTEM image in Figure 2f was also recorded from SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs. The FFT-ED pattern from
the marked square can be indexed to be two sets of diffraction spots,
one of which is corresponding to cubic Mn2O3 labeled by a parallelogram and another spot marked by a circle is
calculated to be related with the (101) plane of tetragonal SnO2. At the same time, the elemental configuration is sharply
visualized by a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) instrument,
where the mapping images in Figure 2g describe the distribution of Mn and Sn mainly focusing
on assemblages and submicrorod stems, respectively. The phase of the
annealed sample was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
in Figure 3a. They
can be well-indexed to be tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445)
and cubic Mn2O3 (JCPDS no. 41-1442) marked
in the pattern. There is no peak for impurity, indicating the high
purity of the product.

To verify the multifunctionality
of the synthetic system in the
present method in regard of incorporating two metal species into the
precursors, we used Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O,
and Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O to substitute
the previous Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O for study and successfully fabricated their corresponding precursors
which were nominated as SnCo, SnNi, and SnZn precursors, respectively.
As shown in Figure S2, these precursors
were profiled by similar XRD patterns with well-defined peaks, demonstrating
good crystallinity. After calcination at 500 or 600 °C, various
SnO2/oxides HHs were harvested, which were analyzed via
the XRD technique in Figure 3. Specifically, the XRD pattern in Figure 3b of SnO2/Co3O4 HHs can be indexed to tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445)
and cubic Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467). Simultaneously,
other hierarchical hybrids (HHs) of SnO2/NiO and SnO2/Zn2SnO4 can effectively be identified
by XRD patterns in Figure 3c,d, namely, tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445), cubic
NiO (Fm3̅m, JCPDS 47-1049),
and cubic Zn2SnO4 (JCPDS 24-1470). These XRD
results confirmed the formation of various SnO2/oxide hybrids,
implying the versatility of the present method.

The FESEM image
in Figure 4a captures
a panoramic sight of SnO2/Co3O4 HHs,
which displays the screw-nut-like structures that
are clearly observed from Figure 4b. It is clear that the caps are attached at both ends,
and some discrete nanoparticles bind on the rodlike stem. Furthermore,
the microstructure details of SnO2/NiO HHs were also inspected. Figure 4c remarkably describes
the typical one-dimensional structures. On the basis of the observation
from the higher-magnification FESEM image in Figure 4d, several nanorods are preferentially stacked
into bundles with a few nanoparticles scattered onto the nanorod surface.
When Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O replaced
Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O in our synthesis,
final SnO2/Zn2SnO4 HHs were transformed
from the precursor. It is interesting to note that SnO2/Zn2SnO4 HHs still maintain one-dimensional
structures but hexagonal prisms, as indicated in Figure 5a,b. Because of sintering at
high temperature, some prisms suffer from cracking pointed by arrows.
The mapping description in Figure 5c gives the elemental distribution of Zn and Sn, implying
the uniform dispersion of SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 domains over the whole hexagonal prism.

and (c) 2 μm.

To shed light on the
formation mechanism of precursors, some tests
and related analyses were done. In the XRD pattern of the SnMn precursor
in Figure S2, the appearance of the peak
at about 10.8° demonstrates the formation of a glycolate precursor.29 A control experiment was carried out where K2SnO3·3H2O was not applied with
other conditions being kept constant, and finally, flowerlike Mn–glycolate
was obtained, as shown in Figure S3. After
heat treatment, pristine Mn2O3 was attained
and indexed by the XRD pattern in Figure S4. Similarly, if Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was not added, no product was harvested. The comparative results
implied that Mn was inclined to bond with EG but not with l-proline and had higher coordination ability to bond with EG
than Sn. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that the SnMn precursor
was composed of Mn–glycolate and Sn–proline. To obtain
more information about the precursor, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of l-proline and SnMn precursor were recorded in Figure S5. A remarkable band at 3433 cm–1 in both spectra implies the occurrence of hydroxyl vibration. In
the spectrum of the SnMn precursor, the bands at 2934, 2895, and 2837
cm–1 are related to the asymmetric stretching vibration
of N–H and C–H groups.30 It
should be noted that the C=O stretch band for the carboxyl
group of l-proline appeared at 1623 cm–1 and disappeared in the spectrum of the precursor.31,32 There are two new bands at 1633 and 1462 ascribed to the asymmetric
νas(COO–) and symmetric νs(COO–) stretching of carboxyl groups, respectively.
According to the wavenumber separation value (D)
between the νas(COO–) and νs(COO–) bands, the type of interaction between
the carboxylate head and metal ions can be distinguished as monodentate,
bidentate bridging, bidentate chelating, or ionic interaction.32−34 Here, the D value is 171 cm–1, suggesting that the carboxyl groups play a role in bidentate bridging.32−34 Thereafter, the Sn–proline complex is described as Sn–O–C(R)–O–Sn
in which l-proline bridges two Sn atoms at each end. Some
unsaturated Mn atoms in Mn–glycolate and Sn atoms in Sn–proline
would bond with the carboxyl of Sn–proline and hydroxyl of
Mn–glycolate, which rendered the hybridization of SnMn precursor
HHs. When Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O was
used in the synthetic system, the as-attained SnZn precursor exhibited
well-shaped hexagonal prisms. Moreover, the characteristic XRD peak
corresponding to the metal glycolate disappears. Correspondingly,
the SnZn precursor is inferred to be a single-source analogue of the
SnZn–proline complex. After calcination at high temperature,
it completely transformed into SnO2 and ZnSn2O4, similar to the reported Prussian blue-structured Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 as a template to fabricate
ZnO and ZnFe2O4 components.26 These precursors, including SnMn, SnCo, SnNi, and SnZn
precursors, showed prominently different coordination properties and
crystallization behaviors to get different structure bimetal oxides,
which mainly originated from the different intrinsic properties of
cations, that is, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. A more comprehensive and extensive investigation
into the underlying fundamentals for such distinctions with changing
metal cations is undergoing. From the above discussion, the significance
of synthetic system was highlighted. The option of appropriate system
can moderate the hybridization fashion and determine the realization
of final hybridization.

To prove the superiority of such hierarchical
structures as the
anode materials, another control sample of SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods was attained from its precursor
via calcination. As can be seen in Figure S6a, the FESEM image of the precursor of SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods describes a rodlike structure with a length
of 2–8 μm and a diameter of hundred nanometers to several
micrometers. Moreover, this morphology was maintained after annealing,
as demonstrated in Figure S6b. The XRD
pattern of SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods
in Figure S7 offers a similar profile,
which is determined to be tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445)
and cubic Mn2O3 (JCPDS no. 41-1442). Further
confirmation of chemical composition was given by the STEM mapping
results (Figure S6c), evidently demonstrating
the homogeneous distribution of Sn, Mn, and O throughout the rodlike
structure.

When tested as an anode material for LIBs, the electrochemical
behaviors of several samples were characterized. As shown in Figure 6a, both SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs and submicrorods exhibit good rate
capability. At the low current densities of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 A g–1, the capacity of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs is a little higher than that of the submicrorods. However,
when the current density increases to 2 and 5 A g–1, both samples offer a similar reversible capacity. As the rate is
back to 0.5 A g–1 in Figure S8, the specific capacity of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs is 859.2 mA h g–1 and is comparable
with that of 814 mA h g–1 at the initial current
density of 0.5 A g–1, indicating a good rate capacity
of the active material. The reversible capacity can be still maintained
as high as 839.9 mA h g–1 after 260 cycles. However,
SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods rapidly degrade
to about 400 mA h g–1 just at 140th cycle.

Figure 6 (a) Rate capability
and (b) cycling performance of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs and submicrorods at a current density
of 0.5 A g–1 and (c,d) cycling performance of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs at current densities of 1
and 2 A g–1, respectively.

Figure S9 shows the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs
at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the potential range
of 0.01–3.0 V. In the first cathodic process, a weak and broad
cathodic peak was located at around 1.26 V but disappeared in the
successive cycles, which can be attributed to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+.35,36 The main cathodic peak
at around 0.96 V is ascribed to the reduction of SnO2 to
Sn and Li2O.37 The last main
peak located at 0.24 V is associated with the reduction of Mn2+ to Mn0 and the alloying reaction of Sn and Li+ (LixSn).35,36,38,39 In the anodic
process, the anodic peak at 0.56 V is for the oxidation of LixSn alloy to Sn.38 The anodic peak at 1.27 V is ascribed to the oxidation of Mn0 to Mn2+ and Sn0 partially back to SnO2.40,41 In the second scan, the cathodic peak at
0.96 V weakens and then vanishes subsequently, suggesting an irreversible
transition of SnO2 to Sn.37,41 Other two
peaks at ∼0.44 and 0.06 V are attributed to the reduction of
Mn2+ to Mn0 and the formation of an LixSn alloy, respectively.35,36,39

Here, the cycling performance of the
as-prepared samples at different
current densities was also studied. First, at the current density
of 0.5 A g–1 in Figure 6b, the initial discharge capacity and charge
capacity of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs are 1598.7
and 1021.4 mA h g–1, respectively. The significant
capacity loss of 577.3 mA h g–1 is generally considered
to be caused by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
layer on the surface of anode materials in the first discharge process.42−47 Subsequently, the capacity profile undergoes declination followed
by inclination, which is familiarly observed for transition metal
oxides. This phenomenon generally results from the reversible
formation of the gel-like polymeric layer.48−53 This process was recognized as the activation stage. Even after
300 cycles, SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs could
maintain stable capacity, delivering 867.8 mA h g–1, whereas SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods
show a trend of capacity down all the way and just recover 428 mA
h g–1 at the 140th cycle. When the cycling performance
of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs is tested at the
current density of 1 A g–1 (Figure 6c), the first discharge and charge capacities
are 1734.9 and 1126 mA h g–1, respectively, with
a high initial coulombic efficiency of 65%. The irreversible capacity
can be attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte to form
a SEI layer on the surface of the electrode.42−47 From the sixth cycle onward, the electrode shows an excellent stable
capacity, and the reversible capacity of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs is 610.3 mA h g–1 after 600 cycles
with only a slight decay of 0.29 mA h g–1 per
cycle. By comparison, as displayed in Figure S10a, the first discharge and charge capacities of SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods and pristine Mn2O3 are 1519.5 and 1028.5 as well as 933.7 and 526.1 mA
h g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1. After lithium storage cycling, the reversible capacity of both
samples degrades to 192.6 at 250th cycle and 290.4 mA h g–1 at 100th cycle. When the current density increases to 2 A g–1 (Figure 6d), SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs can still
maintain a good cycling performance, which additionally suggests a
remarkable rapid charging ability. It delivers a reversible capacity
as high as 487 mA h g–1 after 1001 cycles. The other
two electrodes made of SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods and pristine Mn2O3 cannot endure
long cycling at such a high current density. From Figure S10, the reversible capacities of the former electrode
are only 192.6 and 115 mA h g–1 after 250 cycles
at the current densities of 1 and 2 A g–1, respectively,
recovering about 12.7 and 7.6% from the first discharge capacity.
In addition, the latter one experiences 100 lithiation/delithiation
cycles, and the charge capacities reduce to 290.4 and 202.7 mA h g–1 at the current densities of 1 and 2 A g–1, respectively.

On the basis of the above data and analyses,
it was well-concluded
that SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs exhibited a superior
rate capability and cycling life to SnO2/Mn2O3 submicrorods and pristine Mn2O3. Through the structural and compositional comparison among them,
the superiority of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs
can be analyzed as follows. The nanosheet-interconnecting network
could raise the surface area of the electrode materials, favorably
increasing the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte
and allowing the full occurrence of electrochemical reactions, demonstrated
a better performance of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs than the submicrorods. What is more, the structural voids benefited
buffering the volumetric variation of the active materials during
the repeated discharge/charge process. Last, the synergetic effect
of SnO2 and Mn2O3 was another dominating
reason to enhance the electrochemical performance of the composite,54 which was verified by the worse lithium storage
property of the single-phase Mn2O3.

Conclusions
In summary, the general fabrication of integrated SnO2/metal oxide HHs has been devised based on the template-directing
route, including Mn2O3, Co3O4, NiO, and Zn2SnO4 as the oxide phase.
Their corresponding precursors containing tin and another metal were
successfully designed by taking advantage of the synergistic role
of l-proline and EG. By analyzing the phase and bond information
via XRD and FTIR, single- or double-source precursors could be engineered
depending on the coordination and/or intrinsic property of different
metal species. In principle, the synthetic strategy is applicable
to the integration of other metal oxides. Thereinto, SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs were featured as architectural hybrids
with flowerlike clusters anchoring on the rod stem. In accordance
with our present work, SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs as the anode material for LIBs showed the enhanced storage capacity
and cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance of
SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs could be attributed
to their special nanohybrid hierarchical architecture. It proved once
more that the reasonable design of nanoarchitectures showed an encouraging
avenue to improve the performance of anode materials for LIBs.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs
All chemical reagents were used as received without any further
purification. The synthesis of the SnO2/Mn2O3 hybrid precursor (SnMn precursor) was conducted by a simple
refluxing method. In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 0.5 mmol K2SnO3·3H2O, and 1 mmol l-proline
were dispersed into 40 mL of EG and oil-bathed in a one-neck capped
flask connected with a condenser at 170 °C for 6 h under continuous
stirring. After being cooled to room temperature naturally, the product
was centrifuged, washed with ethanol several times, and then dried
at 60 °C overnight to obtain brown powder. Subsequently, the
precursor was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h in an air atmosphere
with the heating rate of 2 °C/min. Finally, the dark brown SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs were obtained.

Synthesis of
SnO2/Co3O4 HHs
The synthetic
procedures were similar to those of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs except that Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was replaced with 1 mmol Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O in the experiment.

Synthesis of SnO2/NiO HHs
The synthetic
procedures were similar to those of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs except that Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was replaced with 1 mmol Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O in the experiment.

Synthesis of SnO2/Zn2SnO4 HHs
The synthetic procedures
were similar to those of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs except that Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was replaced with 0.5 mmol Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O in the experiment, and
the corresponding precursor was annealed at 600 °C.

Synthesis of
Mn2O3 Nanosheets
The synthetic procedures
were similar to those of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs except that K2SnO3·3H2O was not applied in the experiment.

Synthesis of SnO2/Mn2O3 Submicrorods
The synthetic
procedures were similar to those of SnO2/Mn2O3 HHs except that the flask was opened
and not connected with the condenser when oil-bathing the reagents.

Characterization of Materials
The phase detection of
products was performed by powder XRD (Philips X’Pert Pro Super
diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å).
TEM and FESEM images were recorded with a transmission electron microscope
(JEOL, JEM-1011) and a field emission scanning electron microscope
(JEOL, JSM-6700F), respectively. HRTEM images were recorded using
an electron microscope (JEM-2100F, accelerating voltage: 200 kV) coupled
with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) instrument. TGA
(PerkinElmer Diamond TG/DTA apparatus) was conducted at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min in flowing air. FTIR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker EQUINOX55 spectrometer with a potassium bromide pellet
as a control.

Electrochemical Characterization
The working electrode
was made of 70 wt % active material, 20 wt % conductive material (acetylene
black), and 10 wt % binder (carboxymethylcellulose sodium). The above
materials were mixed with water by grinding to form a slurry, which
was then pasted on the pure copper foil and dried at 80 °C in
vacuum. The obtained foil was cut into a disk with a diameter of 12
mm, and the mass density of the active material was about 1 mg cm–2. The electrochemical measurements were performed
using CR2032 coin cells in the voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V.
The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with the lithium
foil as the counter electrode and the Celgard 2400 membrane as the
separator. The electrolyte was a mixture of 1 M LiPF6 in
ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate in a
volume ratio of 1:1:1 purchased from Samsung Chemical Corporation.
