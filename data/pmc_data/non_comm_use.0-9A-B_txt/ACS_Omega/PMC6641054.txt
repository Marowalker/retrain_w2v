Stimuli-responsive
coordination polymer particles (CPPs) show great
promise for encapsulating and releasing cargos due to their unique
and highly tailorable structures and properties. In particular, photoresponsive
CPPs have received enormous interest, as noninvasive light can be
spatially and temporally controlled, resulting in great safety and
efficiency. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of novel
photodegradable CPPs by infinite coordination polymerization of Zn2+ and a photocleavable organic linker containing o-nitrobenzyl derivatives. We further demonstrate that these novel
photodegradable CPPs are able to efficiently encapsulate cargos and
are applicable for on-command drug release upon low-power UV light
irradiation (5.78 mW/cm2). Because light is a highly desirable
remote-trigger and can be used externally, we expect that these photodegradable
CPPs can provide a unique platform for controlled cargo release.

Introduction
Coordination polymer
particles (CPPs) have recently emerged as
a new class of functional materials, with various potential applications
in catalysis, gas storage, sensing, and molecular electronics.1−10 CPPs have also proven to be able to efficiently encapsulate and
deliver various cargos, such as drugs,11,12 organic dyes,13,14 and inorganic nanoparticles,15,16 in their coordination
networks. Previously, the release of drugs/cargos from CPPs was primarily
diffusion controlled.11,17 Thus, to control the release
kinetics, there is growing interest in introducing functionalities
into CPPs to develop stimuli-responsive CPPs, which can respond to
specific triggers.18,19 However, stimuli-responsive CPPs
that are able to change their structures or properties in response
to external stimuli such as light, temperature, pH, or chemicals for
on-command cargo release are still limited.20−22

Among
various external triggers that are being explored in constructing
stimuli-responsive CPPs, light is of particular interest, as it only
requires simple manipulation and in principle can conveniently offer
both temporal and spatial control.23−28 So far, developing CPPs that are able to degrade and release the
encapsulated cargos upon light irradiation has still remained a great
challenge. Because CPPs are constructed from metal ions and polydentate
organic ligands,29−32 an attractive approach to synthesize photoresponsive CPPs is by
incorporating photoresponsive organic ligands into the coordination
network. In this context, o-nitrobenzyl derivatives,
which can undergo efficient photocleavage reactions under UV light
(λ = 365 nm) irradiation, are ideal candidates for synthesizing
photoresponsive CPPs. In particular, the photolysis of o-nitrobenzyl is an intermolecular rearrangement process, which does
not require protonic solvents and can readily occur both in solution
and the solid state.33 More importantly,
the photocleavage of o-nitrobenzyl derivatives can
be triggered using low-power UV light, which is a distinct feature
required for biological applications because low-power UV light causes
less photodamage to biological tissues and cells.34 Therefore, considering their interesting properties and
potential applications as delivery carriers, CPPs containing o-nitrobenzyl groups could be very promising for light-controlled
cargo release.

Here, we report the design and synthesis of novel
photodegradable
CPPs by infinite coordination polymerization of Zn2+ and
a photocleavable organic linker containing o-nitrobenzyl
derivatives. We further demonstrate that these photodegradable CPPs
are able to efficiently encapsulate cargos and are applicable for
on-command drug/cargo release upon the irradiation of low-power UV
light (λ = 365 nm, 5.78 mW/cm2). The entire process
is illustrated in Scheme 1a. We believe this proof-of-concept research not only represents
a simple approach to prepare stimuli-responsive CPPs but may also
provide a unique coordination-based system for on-command drug delivery.

Results
and Discussion
In this approach, the key to achieve photodegradable
CPPs is to
incorporate the o-nitrobenzyl group into polydentate
organic ligands. Therefore, we first designed and synthesized a novel
photocleavable coordination ligand containing the o-nitrobenzyl functional group, (2-nitro-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene)bis(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate) (Scheme 1b, hereafter referred to as NPMIC). The detailed
synthetic procedures for NPMIC can be found in the Experimental Section. The chemical structure of the NPMIC
was confirmed by both 1H and 13C NMR spectra
(Figures S1 and S2). Because of the fast
response of the o-nitrobenzyl group, the photocleavage
reaction was efficient in the NPMIC ligands, simultaneously releasing
free carboxylic acids and aromatic aldehydes (Scheme 1b).35 The photolysis
products of the NPMIC ligands were detected by electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Figure S3),
suggesting that the NPMIC ligands can be used as photocleavable coordination
ligands in CPPs.

The photodegradable CPPs can be conveniently
synthesized by coordination
between Zn2+ and NPMIC ligands (1:1 molecular ratio) at
room temperature (hereafter referred to as the ZnNPMIC particles).
The resulting ZnNPMIC particles were then purified by centrifugation
and washed several times with ethanol. The diameters of these as-synthesized
particles can be controlled from ∼160 to 1500 nm using different
concentrations of the precursor solutions (from 0.1 to 0.001 M) as
shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1a–c). The
average sizes of the ZnNPMIC particles were also determined using
dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, confirming that the particle
sizes can be controlled by varying the concentrations of the Zn ions
and NPMIC ligands (Figure 1d). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figure S4) indicated that these ZnNPMIC particles
were amorphous. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
of a typical ZnNPMIC particle also revealed that these coordinatively
formed particles were amorphous (Figure 1e,f). Furthermore, EDX mapping results (Figure 1g) demonstrated that
both zinc and nitrogen were homogeneously distributed over the particle,
implying that both Zn2+ and NPMIC ligands were uniformly
coordinated to form the coordination particles.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum confirmed
the coordination
of the NPMIC ligands to the Zn ions, as the peak at 623 cm–1 is the characteristic peak of the Zn–N bond (Figure 2a).36 The photodegradation of these ZnNPMIC particles (∼550 nm)
upon irradiation by low-power UV light at 365 nm can be revealed by
the FTIR results. Obviously, the ester bond at 1756 cm–1 was cleaved and the intensity of the peak diminished after photoirradiation
(Figure 2a). Meanwhile,
the C–H stretching vibration peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm–1 and the C=O stretching vibration peak at 1645
cm–1 of the aldehyde groups appeared. Moreover,
the C=O stretching peak at 1720 cm–1 corresponding
to the carboxylic group also emerged, indicating the cleavage of the
ester bond and formation of aldehydes and carboxylic acids upon photoirradiation
(Scheme 1b).35 As shown in Figure 2b, increased absorption over a wide range
of wavelengths in the 300–400 nm range was observed after UV
irradiation. This can be attributed to the photocleavage of o-nitrobenzyl moieties and formation of species of various
sizes containing nitrosobenzyl and residual nitrobenzyl units.37 The degradation of the ZnNPMIC particles under
photoirradiation was further confirmed by the DLS measurements. The
average diameters of these particles at different time intervals of
UV irradiation decreased from 550 to 220 nm (Figure 2c), implying that the CPPs were degraded
via photolysis of the bridging ligands. Further examination of the
ZnNPMIC particles under short UV irradiation (∼10 min) revealed
that the degradation of the ZnNPMIC particles was heterogeneous as
it can be seen that the particle contained multiple holes of different
sizes (Figure 2d).

CPPs are known to be able to encapsulate and release cargos,
although
the releasing process was mainly diffusion controlled in previous
reports.11,17 To investigate the application of the ZnNPMIC
particles for the light-controlled cargo release, we first studied
the encapsulation and release of fluorescein in the ZnNPMIC particles
(average diameter ≈550 nm). The encapsulation of fluorescein
into these particles was confirmed by UV–vis absorption measurement,
and the loading efficiency was determined to be 9% (see Experimental Section for details). The UV–vis result
also showed the distinction between the fluorescein and the ZnNPMIC
particles (Figure S5). As shown in Figure 3a, the fluorescein@ZnNPMIC
particles still maintained their spherical structure. Meanwhile, no
dramatic variation in the particle size could be found from DLS measurements
(Figure S6). Only ∼17% of fluorescein
was released in aqueous solutions for over 45 h without photoirradiation
at room temperature (Figure 3b), suggesting that these ZnNPMIC particles are relatively
stable, and only a small fraction of dyes diffused into the solution.
In sharp contrast, the release rate was significantly increased and
nearly 100% release of fluorescein was achieved for only 15 h under
UV light irradiation, demonstrating that these ZnNPMIC particles are
highly efficient for light-controlled cargo release. In addition,
the size of the ZnNPMIC particles also affected the release rates
of cargos. For example, we investigated the release of fluorescein
from ZnNPMIC particles with different sizes and the results indicated
that larger ZnNPMIC particles exhibited much faster release kinetics
(Figure S7).

Figure 3 (a) TEM image of the
ZnNPMIC particles (∼550 nm) encapsulated
with fluorescein. (b) Release profiles of fluorescein from fluorescein@ZnNPMIC
particles at room temperature, with and without UV light irradiation.

On the basis of the above results,
we then employed these ZnNPMIC
particles for potential drug delivery. TCN, an antibiotic agent, and
doxorubicin (DOX), a known anticancer drug, were used as model drugs
for this purpose.38,39 The encapsulation was completed
during the formation of ZnNPMIC particles, with sizes of around ∼200
nm (Figure S8). The loading efficiency
was determined to be ∼10 and 9% for TCN and DOX, respectively.
The light-triggered release was taken out in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) solutions at pH 7.4 (37 °C). The release amounts of TCN
and DOX from ZnNPMIC particles suspended in PBS were less than 42
and 23% for over 20 h, respectively, indicating that the ZnNPMIC particles
are relatively stable under physiological conditions. The much higher
release efficiency in TCN is likely caused by the smaller molecular
size of TCN molecules, which can lead to a faster diffusion rate.40 Upon UV light irradiation, however, an accelerated
release rate was observed. Approximately 90 and 89% of TCN and DOX
were released into the PBS solutions, respectively. These results
revealed that the photoresponsive o-nitrobenzyl groups
played a critical role in light-controlled drug release.

The
efficient encapsulation and release of drugs using photodegradable
ZnNPMIC particles was further investigated by in vitro cytotoxicity
assays on HeLa cells using DOX@ZnNPMIC particles. As shown in Figure 4c, the as-prepared
DOX@ZnNPMIC particles can be taken up by HeLa cells possibly via internalizing
through the endocytosis mechanism.41,42 Treatment
of HeLa cells with bare ZnNPMIC particles, with or without low-power
UV light irradiation, will not lead to any appreciable cell death
after 48 h (Figure S9). At low DOX uptake
concentrations (<0.1 μg/mL), treatment of HeLa cells with
DOX@ZnNPMIC particles did not cause any appreciable cell death (Figure 4d). As the DOX concentration
increased to 2 μg/mL, the cell viability decreased to 76%, indicating
that only sufficient DOX diffusing from ZnNPMIC particles can kill
HeLa cells at high loading concentrations. In contrast, the cell viability
of DOX@ZnNPMIC particles upon UV irradiation for 60 min can reach
to 78% at 0.1 μg/mL, which is close to that of the HeLa cells
treated with the free DOX. The cytotoxic effect of the DOX released
from DOX@ZnNPMIC particles became more obvious as the uptake concentration
of DOX increased, and the cell viability notably reduced down to 29%
at 2 μg/mL after UV irradiation for 60 min. These results suggest
that the DOX released from the DOX@ZnNPMIC particles can induce cell
death, and the drug release process can be controlled using low-power
UV light due to photocleavage of the bridging ligands in ZnNPMIC particles.
Whereas it also implies that the cytotoxic effect of DOX@ZnNPMIC particle
is a fast process after triggering by low-power UV light.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have designed and synthesized novel photodegradable
CPPs and explored their photoresponsive properties for light-controlled
cargo release. The photodegradable CPPs were achieved by incorporating
the o-nitrobenzyl functional group into the bridging
organic ligands. We show that low-power UV light can trigger the degradation
of the CPPs, as observed by significant changes in the hydrodynamic
sizes, with different UV exposure times. More importantly, these photodegradable
CPPs are able to encapsulate organic dyes and drugs and release them
in response to light, implying that they can be used as functional
carriers for delivering therapeutic cargos in the future. Because
light is a highly desirable remote-trigger and can be used externally,
we expect that these photodegradable CPPs can provide a unique platform
for controlled/targeted release of other cargos. Our study also indicates
that stimuli-responsive CPPs can be achieved by designing new polydentate
bridging ligands with new functionalities.

Sigma-Aldrich), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile
(99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich), ethyl alcohol (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), zinc
nitrate hexahydrate (Alfa Aesar), tetracycline (TCN) (TCI Chemicals),
fluorescein (TCI Chemicals), DOX was obtained from DOX hydrochloride
(TCI Chemicals). THF (≥99.9%; Sigma-Aldrich) was refluxed with
sodium and a small amount of benzophenone and distilled prior to use.

Synthesis of 2-Nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic Acid
2-Nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic
acid was first synthesized according to the previously reported method.1 A stirred mixture of 1,3-dimethyl-2-nitrobenzene
(15.8 g, 0.105 mol), water (800 mL), and sodium hydroxide (6.4 g,
0.16 mol) was heated to 95 °C, then KMnO4 (66 g, 0.418
mol) was added in portions over a period of 3 h. The resulting mixture
was refluxed for another 20 h and then cooled and filtered; the filtrate
was acidified with concentrated HCl, and the precipitate was dried
and collected with a good yield (95%). 1H NMR (dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6, 400 MHz) δ
(ppm): 7.56 (m, 3H), 5.46 (t, 2H), 4.52 (d, 4H).

Synthesis of
2-Nitro-1,3-benzenedimethanol (NBD)
A
solution of 2-nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.0 g, 38 mmol)
in 50 mL of anhydrous THF was cooled to 0 °C in the presence
of N2, and then 1.0 M borane tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) was
added dropwise over about 1 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to
be warmed slowly to room temperature and stirred for another 48 h.
Methanol (40 mL) was then added into the reaction system slowly using
a syringe. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated
with a rotary evaporator. The residue was redissolved in ethyl acetate
and washed with water (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was dried
with anhydrous MgSO4 overnight before the solvent was removed
by a rotary evaporator. The resulting yellow solid was further purified
by silica gel chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate = 1:1) to obtain
NBD (4.5 g, 65% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 8.20 (s, 2H), 7.82 (s, 1H),
3.37 (s, COOH).

Synthesis of (2-Nitro-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene)bis(1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate) (NPMIC)
1,1′-Carbonyldiimidazole
(1.67 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (20 mL), and a solution
of NBD (0.732 g, 4 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL) was added to this
solution at room temperature for 2 h under stirring. The solution
was stirred at room temperature for 6 h, and the solvent was evaporated
under vacuo. The crude product was dissolved in chloroform, washed
with water, and then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate overnight.
The product thus obtained was recrystallized from ethyl acetate to
obtain the NPMIC (1.22 g, 82% yield). The structure was confirmed
by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopies (Figures S1 and S2).

Preparation of ZnNPMIC
Coordination Polymer Particles
ZnNPMIC particles were synthesized
by adding an aqueous solution
(3 mL) of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (187 mg, 0.625 mmol) to an ethanol
solution (13 mL) of NPMIC (232 mg, 0.625 mmol) under stirring at room
temperature. Upon mixing, a white solid was immediately observed.
After ∼5 min, ethanol (30 mL) was added into the reaction mixture
to stabilize the particles. The resulting particles were then purified
by centrifugation and washed three times with pure ethanol. ZnNPMIC
particles were collected as a white solid or redispersed in ethanol
to obtain a colloidal suspension.

Encapsulation of Cargos
in ZnNPMIC Particles
Cargo/ZnNPMIC
particles were obtained by addition of an aqueous solution (3 mL)
of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (187 mg, 0.625 mmol) to an ethanolic solution
(13 mL) of NPMIC (232 mg, 0.625 mmol) containing different cargos
(FLU, TCN, or DOX) (3.3 × 10–3 M) under vigorous
stirring at room temperature. For all cargos, the resulting encapsulated
metal-organic systems were purified by centrifugation and washing
three times with ethanol. The encapsulated systems were finally redispersed
in ethanol or phosphate buffer to obtain the corresponding colloidal
solutions. The loading of cargos was calculated by subtracting the
mass of cargos in the supernatant from the total mass of the cargos
in the initial solution by UV–vis spectroscopy at the characteristic
absorption peak.

Characterization
TEM was performed
with a Hitachi Model
H-7560 microscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
was conducted on a JEM-2100F microscope. FTIR spectra were recorded
by a Bruker VECTOR-22 FTIR spectrometer over potassium bromide pellet.
NMR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 400
NMR spectrometer. PXRD of the product were obtained on a Japan Rigaku
DMax-γA rotation anode X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite
monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å).
UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu 3600
spectrophotometer. DLS spectra were recorded on a NanoBrook 90PLUS
PALS particle size analyzer. MS spectra were recorded on a 2DlC-MS
(Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ) after exposing the ZnNPMIC particles
to UV light. UV light (365 nm) was provided by a ZF-7A portable UV
analyzer.

In Vitro Release
A dialysis bag (cutoff molecular weight:
3500) containing the cargo/ZnNPMIC particles (∼6 mg/mL) dispersed
in PBS solution (pH 7.4) was placed in 100 mL of PBS (pH 7.4; dialysate)
at 37 °C under UV light (365 nm), with stirring. Throughout the
experimental procedure, the solution inside the dialysis bag was also
agitated by magnetic stirring. To determine the increase of cargo
concentration diffused through the dialysis bag, 3 mL of external
PBS solution was taken from the dialysate at prefixed times, and 3
mL of fresh PBS solution was added to keep the volume of the released
solution constant. Each aliquot was analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy
to determine the concentrations of the released cargos. To minimize
the effects of drug decomposition in solution, the external solution
of PBS was changed at a certain time.

MTT Assay and Confocal
Microscopy
HeLa cells were seeded
into a 35-mm glass-bottom culture dish (NEST, China) at a density
of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight in 2
mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum in humidified atmosphere, with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HeLa cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity
of DOX@ZnNPMIC particles by MTT assays. When the cell confluency reached
∼70%, 100 μL of the cells was seeded into 96-well plates
(Costar 3596; Corning) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL.
After incubation overnight, the original medium was replaced with
fresh media containing different concentrations of DOX@ZnNPMIC particles.
After another 48 h of incubation (the first 40/60 min was under UV
light of the control sample), 20 μL of 5 mg/mL filtered MTT
stock solution was added to each well, and the unreacted dye was removed
by aspiration after 4 h. The medium in each well was then removed,
and 150 μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the internalized purple
formazan crystals. The plate was gently agitated for 15 min until
all the crystals were dissolved. The absorbance at 490 nm was recorded
by a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher). Using nontreated cells as
control, the relative cell viability was calculated as Abssample/Abscontrol.

For confocal microscopy, HeLa cells
were seeded in a one-well plate 12 h before use. Then, the culture
medium was replaced by fresh medium containing DOX@ZnNPMIC particles
(filtered by a 220 nm syringe filter prior to use), and the cells
were incubated for 6 h. The cells were washed with PBS buffer three
times, then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature.
The cells were then washed with PBS buffer three times, and the cells
were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to indicate
cell nuclei. After washing with PBS buffer three times, the samples
were examined under a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope.
