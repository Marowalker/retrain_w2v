In
this paper, the Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation of hydroxyl ethers
is described. Various bifunctional alkoxysilanes were obtained and
applied in O-silylation of free hydroxyl groups on the silica surface.
These modified solid materials have been used as excellent supports
for linking synthetic nucleic acids. Nucleic acids permanently attached
to the solid surface were tested in hybridization with complementary
fluorescence-labeled sequences. Detection of nucleic acids anchored
to the solid support was performed by fluorescence microscopy after
hybridization.

Introduction
Hydroelementation of
unsaturated organic compounds is one of the
most important and atom-efficient method for the incorporation of
heteroatoms into various unsaturated systems.1−7 Indeed, the hydrosilylation reaction8−12 provides access to synthetically useful organofunctional
silanes,13−20 which are widely used as synthetic intermediates in several processes.
Alkoxysilanes play a significant role in the synthesis of siloxanes21 and for the preparation of novel, functionalized
silicas which are attractive because of their practical applications.22 The structure of alkoxysilanes, especially their
dual functionality, allows well-defined and unique materials to be
obtained after the spontaneous condensation reaction that takes place
on the material’s surface (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Silanization of OH groups of the materials surface.

Nowadays, coating silica particles
with alkoxysilanes by the formation
of strong covalent Si–O–Si bonds to such surfaces23,24 leads to a large number of new interesting applications.25,26 One of these are solid supports [e.g., controlled pore glass (CPG)
silicas,27 as well as polymeric and hybrid
ones28,29], which allow nucleic acids to be synthesized
on solid phase but with solution interaction. Using CPG gives a larger
surface for growing the oligonucleotide chain.30 The availability of the surface is vital; however, the
properties of linker and surface chemical functionality allow for
finding proper applications. To link biopolymers, amine,31,32 epoxide,33 azide,25 hydroxyl,34 or thiol35 functional groups are mainly used. In practice,
a removable linker is used in nucleic acid synthesis at the solid
phase, but in diagnostic applications, nucleic acids need to be permanently
linked to the solid surface.36

The
chemical linker for the permanent attachment of the synthetic
nucleic acids to the solid support must be very resistant in base
or acid hydrolytic conditions, which are used to completely remove
protecting groups. The nucleic acid was attached to the support by
phosphate linkage using phosphoramidite chemistry.28 Polypropylene29 and polystyrene37−39 are currently the most commonly used as supports for permanent anchored
oligonucleotides. However, a more and more popular functional surface
used in phosphoramidite chemistry is functional glass surfaces because
the swelling of the support (observed for polymers) is eliminated.
However, to permanently anchor the oligonucleotide on the glass surface,
new modifications need to be applied due to the fact that the linkers
commonly used on functional surface are removable. For this purpose,
chemical modification of the glass support with new organofunctional
silanes was applied, which may produce resistant linkers that permanently
anchor oligonucleotides. Alkoxysilanes (i.e., 3-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane)
were used as hydroxy functional linkers, but these are largely unstable
in base hydrolysis conditions (hydroxyl ammonium, temp. 55 °C).
However, such conditions are necessary for the removal of protecting
groups from the oligonucleotide after chemical synthesis. This resulted
in the removal of the oligonucleotide from the support. Other linkers
such as 3-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyltriethoxysilane and N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-4-hydroxy-butyramide40 were applied to increase the linkers’
stability on the glass support. The triethylene glycol ethylacrylamide
linker was also reported, but its lability in ammonium hydrolytic
conditions was observed. This indicates that the critical point is
the instability of the disiloxane bond between the silica support
and the siloxane.41 Because of that the
preparation of modified solid supports chemically resistant to basic
conditions remains a significant synthetic challenge. Herein, we report
the highly selective synthesis of bifunctional alkoxysilanes via the
hydrosilylation reaction. They were subsequently applied to silanization
of the CPG silica surface, which yielded new supports that would allow
for the permanent linking of synthetic nucleic acids. We tested mono-,
di-, and tri-alkoxysilanes, which enabled selection of the most permanent
links to be used later in automated oligonucleotide syntheses. The
stability and functionality of these links were further verified in
hybridization experiments where fluorescently tagged short oligonucleotides
were used.

Results and Discussion
The first goal was to obtain
alkoxysilanes with hydroxyl functional
groups. It is commonly known that this may increase the availability,
flexibility, and reactivity of such groups. As a starting point, the
reactions between unsaturated ethers containing OH groups with various
ethoxysilanes were considered. Unfortunately, the presence of the
free hydroxyl moiety significantly hindered the hydrosilylation with
alkoxysilanes. Because of this, it was decided to temporarily protect
all OH groups with a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. In practice, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) has been used as a TMS donor because gaseous ammonia is the
only byproduct. To increase the silylating potential of HMDS, numerous
catalysts and activators have been tested.42 One of these are metal triflates,43,44 which attract
special attention because of their high catalytic activity in various
organic transformations.45−50 It is worth noting that inexpensive Bi(OTf)3 is the most
effective in this process. It was selected as the catalyst in the
silylation reaction (Scheme 1). It is worth reiterating that this procedure has been used
by us in our previous research.15 Structures
of synthesized products are summarized in Figure 2. All of them are known in the literature.

Scheme 1 Silylation of Unsaturated Ethers
O-silyl protected unsaturated ethers (1–5)
were subjected to catalytic combination of various mono-, di- and
trialkoxysilanes and [Pt2{(Me2SiCH=CH2)2O}3] in toluene at 60 °C under
argon atmosphere (Scheme 2). All of these were successfully hydrosilylated dominantly
in the anti-Markovnikov fashion. Table 1 summarizes the results for these reactions.

Thereafter, mono-, di- and tri-ethoxysilanes
with one or two −OSiMe3 groups (products: 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19)
were selected for further work on anchoring nucleic acids to CPGs.
The above-mentioned alkoxysilanes were used in the silanization of
CPG silicas (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Silanization of various silicas with functional alkoxysilanes.

CPG supports result from etching
the surface; hence, their pore
sizes are estimated. Silanization may change the structure of the
surface; therefore, silane with low concentration values should be
used. An optimal surface was selected from surfaces with different
pore sizes (CPG 1000, CPG 1500, CPG 2000, and CPG 3000). Selected
silane (Table 1, entry
12; concentration = 1%) was further applied in silanization of the
above-mentioned CPG silicas. After that we tested so modified CPGs
on automated DNA/RNA synthesizer attaching d(T)4 in four
synthetic cycles collecting and quantifying the dimethoxytrityl (DMT)
cation after last cycle. The measured absorbance of DMT allowed us
to choose CPG 1500 as the most optimal one, which was characterized
by the high level of covalently linked nucleic acid. Next, all of
the selected bifunctional silanes were used in silanization of CPG
1500.

The appropriate silane at various concentrations (1 and
2%) in
toluene was stirred with CPG for 24 h. After that, the silica was
dried for 5 h at 110 °C. It is known that some of the surfaces’
hydroxyl groups could be not silylated by alkoxysilanes. Thereafter,
to block all hydroxyl groups, the modified support was stirred for
24 h in 15% solution of HMDS in toluene. This procedure of protection
was carried out to be sure that the surfaces’ hydroxyl group
would not interrupt the nucleic acid immobilization.

The surfaces
prepared in accordance with the above-mentioned procedure
were applied in further immobilization of nucleic acids. A loading
level of covalently linked biomolecules was evaluated by the measurement
of DMT absorbance before and after the use of basic conditions (Table 2, all entries). In
the case of silicas modified by monoalkoxysilanes (Table 2, entries 1–8), the highest
loading of biomolecules was observed for silanes with higher concentration
(2%; Table 2, entries
3–4 and 7–8). However, with regard to stability in basic
conditions, the most optimal were surfaces modified by less concentrated
solutions (1%; Table 2, entries 1–2 and 5–6). In the case of silanes with
two alkoxy groups (Table 2, entries 9–16), in all cases the level of linked oligonucleotides
was good, but increased linker stability was observed when the support
was additionally treated by HMDS (Table 2, entries 10, 12, 14, and 16). The surfaces
modified by trialkoxysilanes were also characterized by a high level
of loading. However the stability after ammonium treatment was extremely
low (Table 2, entries
17–20 and 23). As it took place in previous tests (Table 2, entries 5–6
and 13–14), here too the surfaces modified by alkoxysilanes
with two hydroxyl groups were the most stable (Table 2, entries 21 and 22). The results presented
in Table 2 show that
using of HMDS during CPG support preparation increases the yield of
oligomer bonding because the accessibility of free hydroxyl groups
for the reaction with nucleoside phosphoramidite is higher. We also
observed that HMDS prevents the removal of nucleic acid during the
deprotection step (treatment by ammonium).

b Structures of silanes used for silanization
of CPG silica:

Seeing that HMDS-modified supports reveal increased the stability
of oligomer bonding in a basic environment, they were used in longer
nucleic acid synthesis. To this end 70 mer seq1 on support D (1% + HMDS) and 26 mer seq2 on the commercial support were synthesized.
Seq2 is fluoresceine-labeled and its sequence is selected to be complementary
with part of seq1. Next, a hybridization of the support with seq1
with the probe seq2 was performed in a hybridization buffer within
1.5 h in 80 °C.

As a reference sample to eliminate the
nonspecific effect of the
support with the probe, we performed hybridization with supports on
which synthesis of seq1 was not performed. After washing, the supports
were analyzed using fluorescent microscopy. The image presented in Figure 4 clearly shows that
in the case of supports silanized by D (1% + HMDS) the
seq1 oligomer is bonded to the support and interacts with a fluorescent
probe. The effect is not visible on supports without seq1.

Conclusions
To sum up, we report
a highly selective synthesis of bifunctional
alkoxysilanes via the hydrosilylation reaction, which were further
applied in silanization of the CPG silicas. The choice of efficient
solid support, as well as a stable linker on its surface still remains
a significant challenge in the synthesis of nucleic acids at the solid
phase. In this paper, we have demonstrated that the presented CPG
supports with linkers bearing hydroxyl groups are effective in the
chemical synthesis of nucleic acids. What is more, the deprotection
of protecting groups (by means of ammonium) does not result in their
complete removal from the solid surface. The thus-obtained oligonucleotides
retain their natural capability of forming such secondary structures
as duplexes. The observed partial removal of oligonucleotide by ammonium
is probably connected with removing a layer of silane with the bonded
oligonucleotide. In all cases, the best results were achieved when
the silane concentration (regardless of the number of alkoxy groups)
was at 1%. Monoethoxy, as well as diethoxysilanes, have been shown
to give the most stable monolayers, especially for linkers bearing
two hydroxyl groups. The results obtained for trialkoxysilanes were
more diversified; the presence of three alkoxy groups may probably
cause additional cross-linking between them, which prevents the formation
of stable monolayers.

Material and Methods
General Information
The reagents and bismuth(III) triflate
used for experiments were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used
without further purification. HMDS was purchased from ABCR GmbH &
Co. KG and used without further purification. CPG silica was purchased
from BioTech Technology. All data connected to the synthesis products
are presented in the Supporting Information file. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (101 MHz)
were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD NanoBay (600 MHz) spectrometer
using C6D6 as the solvent. GC analyses were
performed on a Varian 3400 with a Megabore column (30 m) and TCD.
The mass spectra of products were determined by GC–MS analysis
on a Varian Saturn 2100T, equipped with a BD-5 capillary column (30
m) and Finnigan Mat 800 ion trap detector. Absorption was measured
by Jasco V-650 spectrometer at 498 nm. The oligonucleotide synthesis
was performed on a 4-H-P Synthesizer K & A Laborgeraete on the
substrate 5′-DMT-T-Suc-CPG (Company Biosearch Technologies).

Representative Procedure for the Silylation of Various Unsaturated
Alcohols (1–5)
To one 100 mL one-necked
round-bottom flask, unsaturated alcohol (0.23 mol), HMDS (0.115 mol),
and Bi(OTf)3 (0.0001 mol) were added. The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for a defined time. The reaction progress
was monitored by GC analyses. After the reaction was complete, the
crude product was purified by trap-to-trap distillation to give the
corresponding silylated alcohols (1–5).

Representative
Procedure for the Hydrosilylation (6–19)
To one 100 mL one-necked round-bottom flask, unsaturated
alcohol (0.029 mol), alkoxysilane (0.034 mol), and Karstedt catalyst
(0.028 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C
for 6 h. The reaction progress was monitored by GC and GC–MS
analyses. After the reaction was complete, all volatiles were removed
under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified by trap-to-trap
distillation to give the corresponding silylated alcohols (6–19).

Functionalization of CPG
The appropriate amount of
alkoxysilanes, 0.5 g of CPG-1500, and 25 mL of toluene were placed
in a one-necked round-bottom flask. The mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. Next, the functionalized CPG was filtrated and
washed with toluene (4 × 25 mL) and dried in 110 °C for
5 h. Thereafter, a 15% solution of HMDS in toluene was added to the
modified support and it was stirred at room temperature for 24 h.
After the filtration procedure, the material was washed with toluene
(2 × 25 mL) and dried in 110 °C for 5 h.

Immobilization
of Nucleic Acids
Part 1—Deprotection with the Acid
The support
was weighed (approx. 100 mg) and transferred to a vial by adding 1
mL of 0.1% HCl and 0.5 mL of acrylonitrile and placed in the incubator
for 1 h at 50 °C. Then, each sample was washed successively with
0.1% HCl, H2O Milli-Q, methanol, and diethyl ether and
then transferred back into vials and placed in the incubator for 2
h at 80 °C.

Part 2—Synthesis
The substrates
were weighed
(approx. 15 mg) and placed in small columns, and the synthesis was
performed on them 4-mer deoxythymidine d(TTTT) without removing the
last DMT groups. Phosphoramidite used in the reaction are dT-CE dissolved
in dry acetonitrile (POCH). The synthesis was performed on a scale
of 0.2 μmol for a phosphoramidite condensation time of 5 min.
The reagents used in the reaction were 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA),
dehydrated acetonitrile (POCH), Hyacinth benzylmercaptotetrazole (BMT)
solution—0.25 M BMT (empBIOTECH), oxidizing solution OXI [iodine/water/pyridine/tetrahydrofuran
(THF)], and capping reagent (acetic anhydride/pyridine/THF); the second
capping reagent (1-methylimidazole/THF) was purchased from Roth. After
the synthesis, the synthetic nucleic acid was dried and divided into
two portions, the first portion was weighed and 3% DCA was added,
after that the absorption was measured and the load level was calculated.
Ammonia (32%) was added to the second part of the substrate and left
for 30 min at rt. This was then added to the solution from the substrate
and the substrate itself was also carefully dried and measured for
absorption.

Hybridization
Supports with and
without oligonucleotides
(3 mg) were suspended in 200 μL of hybridization buffer [5×
SSC + 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) + 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin].
The seq2 (11 OD) dissolved in 200 μL of water was heated to
80 °C (5 min) and 8 μL was added to the support and kept
at room temperature for 1.5 h. After this time, the support was washed
in a 3 × 1 mL buffer (2× SSC + 0.1% SDS). The support was
dried in a closed dish under reduced pressure overnight.
