We
report the fabrication of immunosensors based on nanostructured
mats of electrospun nanofibers of polyamide 6 and poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) coated either with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
or gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), whose three-dimensional structure was
suitable for the immobilization of anti-CA19-9 antibodies to detect
the pancreatic cancer biomarker CA19-9. Using impedance spectroscopy,
the sensing platform was able to detect CA19-9 with a detection limit
of 1.84 and 1.57 U mL–1 for the nanostructured architectures
containing MWCNTs and AuNPs, respectively. The high sensitivity achieved
can be attributed to the irreversible adsorption between antibodies
and antigens, as confirmed with polarization-modulated infrared reflection
absorption spectroscopy. The adsorption mechanism was typical Langmuir–Freundlich
processes. The high sensitivity and selectivity of the immunosensors
were also explored in tests with blood serum from patients with distinct
concentrations of CA19-9, for which the impedance spectra data were
processed with a multidimensional projection technique. The robustness
of the immunosensors in dealing with patient samples without suffering
interference from analytes present in biological fluids is promising
for a simple, effective diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at early stages.

1 Introduction
Immunosensors based on
the molecular recognition process between
antibodies and antigens have been developed since the 1960s1−3 upon exploiting physicochemical processes similar to the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.4 These sensors have
been used for a variety of diseases with a number of detection principles,
including electrochemical techniques,5 optical,6 and magneto-optical methods.7 Common to all of these immunosensors is the need to immobilize
either antibodies or antigens on the sensing units, which must preserve
their activity for sufficiently long periods of time and allow for
the binding of the corresponding molecule in the antibody–antigen
pair. This requirement is normally fulfilled by controlling the molecular
architecture of the nanostructured films of which most immunosensors
are made.8−10 In addition to the active layer containing antibodies
or antigens, the nanostructured films contain a matrix designed to
assist in preserving bioactivity and other components (e.g., nanomaterials)
to enhance sensitivity.11 Experimental
methods such as the self-assembled monolayer,12,13 layer-by-layer,14 and Langmuir–Blodgett15−17 techniques have been employed owing to their suitability to build
complex molecular architectures, where synergy may be sought among
the properties of the nanomaterials comprising the immunosensors.

The extensive list of nanomaterials that can be utilized in immunosensors
includes graphene,18−21 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),22−26 carbon nanoballs, metallic nanoparticles,26 and nanostructures derived from natural resources, for example,
chitosan,27 and electrospun polymer nanofibers.28,29 Such nanomaterials are normally used with a twofold purpose. On
one hand, they serve as a matrix for immobilizing the biomolecules,
but they can also be exploited to enhance the sensitivity by increasing
the measured signal. This is the case of carbon nanotubes whose chemical,
thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties make them suitable
for biosensing,30 especially with functionalization
by carboxylic acid groups that allow for interaction with molecules
containing amino groups. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are also used
to amplify the analytical signal either because a higher electric
current can be generated or because they provide a larger number of
active sites in a single recognition reaction.31 These nanomaterials can be further combined with polymer-based
nanostructured architecture such as those made with electrospun polymer
films.23 The advantages of using electrospun
nanofibers, in particular, are associated with cost-effective method
to produce a tridimensional platform of large specific surface area,
high porosity, and one-dimensional confinement characteristics.32 These features can be beneficial for immobilizing
biomolecules with preserved activity and enhancing sensitivity.

In this article, we explore the use of electrospun nanofibers combined
with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to produce
immunosensors for detecting the biomarker CA19-9, referred to as Lewis
antigen, which is the only biomarker approved by the Food and Drug
Administration of the United States for pancreatic cancer.33−35 The choice of this biomarker was based on two factors: (i) on one
hand, biosensors to detect pancreatic cancer at early stages seem
today the only possible avenue to reduce the mortality rate of this
type of cancer, which at present reaches 99.3% of the patients.36 This high rate is caused by the difficulty of
early diagnosis because the disease is silent in most patients and
by the lack of effective treatments;10 (ii)
on the other hand, we shall be able to compare the immunosensors performance
with similar ones reported in the literature, as there has been considerable
efforts to develop sensors for detecting CA19-9,10,34,37−39 including from our group.10 With regard to the use of AuNPs and CNTs, the
aim was to test the suitability of the combination with the electrospun
nanofibers because these nanomaterials can promote enhanced electron
transfer and increase biosensor sensitivity.23,40,41 We have not used neat polyamide 6 (PA6)/poly(allylamine)
(PAH) nanofibers because they are not amenable to be functionalized
for an efficient adsorption of the antibodies.

Detection of
CA19-9 is made here with electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy in the samples where the antigen is added to a buffer
at different concentrations and in samples of blood serum from the
patients of a cancer hospital. To achieve selectivity in such complex
samples as those of blood serum, the impedance spectra data are treated
with a multidimensional projection technique.42 Furthermore, because we aim at establishing generic platforms for
immunosensors that can be extended to other types of cancer, we investigate
the formation of nanofiber mats and sensing mechanisms using the surface-specific
techniques scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarization-modulated
infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Detection of CA19-9 Biomarker
The
immunosensors with the two architectures based on PA6/PAH nanofibers,
modified with MWCNT or AuNPs, were both capable of detecting the antigen
CA19-9 in the buffer solutions, as demonstrated in the electrochemical
impedance spectra in Figure 1a,c. The difference in the real component of the impedance
is particularly relevant at low frequencies, consistent with the results
of similar immunosensors, as the electrical signal below 100 Hz is
normally dominated by the double-layer effects.43 The CA19-9 concentration dependence is best represented
by plotting the change in the real component of the impedance Z′ at 10 Hz, which increases sharply at low concentrations
before saturation when all of the available anti-CA19-9 antibody sites
are occupied by the adsorption of CA19-9 molecules. The adsorption
mechanisms can be explained by using the Langmuir–Freundlich
isotherms, as discussed in the next subsection.

(c) in K3Fe(CN)6 and in K4Fe(CN)6. Change in the real component of the impedance vs CA19-9
concentration for PA6/PAH/MWCNT/anti-CA19-9 (b) and PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9
(d) architectures. The solid curves were calculated with one Langmuir–Freundlich
isotherm in (d) and a combination of two Langmuir–Freundlich
isotherms in (b). The parameters used for the fitting are the adsorption
capacity of the system (taken as proportional to the change in impedance), Zsat, the affinity constant for adsorption K, and the heterogeneity index n.

The major difference between the
two nanostructured architectures
lies in the lower limit of detection and the lower concentration for
saturation of the PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 (Figure 1d) architecture. Indeed, for the PA6/PAH/MWCNT/anti-CA19-9
architecture, the calibration curve in Figure 1b may be approximated by a straight line
up to ca. 4.5 U mL–1, whereas the corresponding
linear region for PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 is up to 2 U mL–1. As for the sensitivity, determined using the International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry method,44 the limit of detection was 1.84 and 1.57 U mL–1 for PA6/PAH/MWCNT/anti-CA19-9 and PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9, respectively.
These limits of detection are lower than those quoted for the commercial
sensors Architect i2000 (2 U mL–1)45 and AxSYM (2 U mL–1)45 and competitive with the commercial sensors KRYPTOR (1.2
U mL–1)45 and Elecsys
(0.6 U mL–1)45 and immunosensors
made with Au/porous graphene nanocomposites matrix (0.006 U mL–1),46 Au–SiO2/Fe3O4 nanospheres (0.01 U mL–1),47 and the sensor made with chitosan/concanavaline
A matrix (0.69 U mL–1).10

In addition to being capable of distinguishing different concentrations
of the biomarker, immunosensors need to be selective for a particular
biomarker. This means that the immunosensors should be robust against
possible interferents commonly present in biological fluids, such
as in blood serum samples. The results in Figure 2 demonstrate the robustness of the two immunosensors,
which are not affected when exposed to glucose, ascorbic acid, and
fetal bovine serum, with tests performed following the same procedures
as in the detection results. In the presence of the interferents, Z′ is close to the value for the control sample of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In contrast, there was a clear increase
for the two samples containing 2 and 48 U mL–1 in Figure 2a and 2.5 and 40
U mL–1 in Figure 2b of CA19-9 biomarker. The difference is particularly
significant for the PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 immunosensors, which
confirms their higher sensitivity inferred from the detection limit
calculated with data in Figure 1d.

Figure 2 Difference in the real component of the impedance for an immunosensor
made with (a) PA6/PAH/MWCNT/anti-CA19-9 and (b) PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9
architectures exposed to PBS and various analytes introduced in PBS.

It is significant that the two
immunosensors could perform successfully
with real samples extracted from the blood serum of four patients
from Barretos Cancer Hospital. To offer a visual demonstration, we
treated the impedance spectra acquired with these patient samples
with a multidimensional projection technique referred to as Interactive
Document Map (IDMAP).42 In this type of
data treatment, each measured spectrum is represented by a circle
on the two-dimensional IDMAP plot, with the positioning being defined
according to the similarity of the spectra, given by eq 1. 1  where δmax and δmin are the maximum and minimum distances
between data instances,
δ(xi, xj) is the distance between two samples
in the original space, and d(yi, yj) is the distance function on the projected space. That is
to say, similar spectra are placed close to each other on the projected
space. Figure 3 shows
that patients whose blood serum has a high CA19-9 concentration (likely
to develop pancreatic cancer) can be easily distinguished from the
patients with lower CA19-9 concentrations.

Figure 3 IDMAP plots obtained
from the impedance spectra of four serum samples
from the patients in Barretos Cancer Hospital using the sensing units:
(a) PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9 and (b) PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9.
The axes are not labeled because in IDMAP plots what matters is the
relative distance between data points. That is to say, the closer
the points are on the plot, the more similar the corresponding impedance
spectra are.

2.2 Adsorption
Mechanisms Behind Biosensing
It is now well established that
the high sensitivity and selectivity
of immunosensors are ascribed to the irreversible adsorption of the
detected antigens (or antibodies) on immobilized antibodies (or antigens).9,10 This has been proven for cancer biomarkers as well, as exemplified
with different types of experimental methods, including nanogravimetry,48 PM-IRRAS,9,10 and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).48 In this study, we also
probed these adsorption mechanisms and established models that account
for the impedance experimental data.

SEM images of the nanofibers
coated with MWCNTs and AuNPs are shown in Figure 4a,d, respectively. Two images of the same
nanofibers mats were taken and shown to display the same qualitative
surface characteristics. Of note are typical23 200 nm diameter electrospun nanofibers decorated with MWCNTs in Figure 4a and a uniform coating
of 18 nm AuNPs in Figure 4d, consistent with the literature.44 When these nanofibers were coated with a layer of anti-CA19-9 antibodies,
the morphology changed entirely with irregularly shaped objects occupying
most of the image (see Figure 4b,e). This applies to both nanofibers architectures, indicating
that the adsorption of the antibody layer predominates as far as morphology
is concerned. The SEM images of the PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9 and
PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 architectures obtained after the nanofibers
mats were exposed to a given CA19-9 concentration are shown in Figure 4c,f, respectively.
The concentration chosen was 40 U mL–1, close to
the saturation of the anti-CA19-9 sites, according to the results
in Figure 1b,d. The PA6/PAH nanofibers now appear coated
with layers of biomarker, giving rise to fibers with no defined shape
in both cases. The adsorption of anti-CA19-9 (Figure 4e) produces spherical clusters, which bind
to gold nanoparticles. After the addition of 40 U mL–1 of CA19-9 biomarker (Figure 4f), as in the previous images, the PA6/PAH fibers lost their
defined shape. This image was obtained with 30 000 times magnification
to allow for the visualization of the fiber coating.

Figure 4 SEM images of nanofibers
mats of (a) PA6/PAH/MWCNTs; (b) PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9;
(c) PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9/40 U mL–1 biomarker;
(d) PA6/PAH/AuNPs; (e) PA6/PA6/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9; and (f) PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9/40
U mL–1 biomarker.

Interpretation of the SEM images provides evidence of the
adsorption
of CA19-9 antigen biomarkers, but it does not suffice to determine
which chemical groups were involved in such adsorption. This can be
reached by analyzing the PM-IRRAS spectra in Figure 5, where the baseline correction was made
by taking the nanofibers mats of PA6/PAH/MWCNTs and PA6/PAH/AuNPs
as reference. The adsorption of the bioactive layer of anti-CA19-9
antibodies could perhaps be expected to lead to identical spectra.
However, a comparison of the spectra for 0 U mL–1 in Figure 5a,b points
to the differences because the number of anti-CA19-9 molecules adsorbed
and their organization depend on the functionalized substrate. In
the spectra, the most prominent bands are (i) amide I between 1600
and 1700 cm–1 assigned to vibrational modes of carbonyl
(C=O) from the carboxylic acid groups in the amino acids; (ii)
amide II between 1500 and 1600 cm–1, where 60% of
the vibration is associated with the N–H bond, whereas the
remaining 40% is related to the C–N bond stretching of the
amide groups. The bands are all directed upward, which means that
the dipole moments of the groups involved are preferably oriented
on the film plane. Because the bands in this region of the spectrum
originate from proteins, all of them were affected by exposing the
anti-CA19-9 lying on the active layer to the CA19-9 biomarker. The
intensity of PM-IRRAS bands depends on the orientation as well as
the number of functional groups giving rise to a specific band. Therefore,
in some cases, adsorption of increasing amounts of analyte leads to
a linear increase in band intensity, as occurred with amide I bands
from CA19-9 in previous works to allow for a quantitative analysis.8,49 With the PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9 and PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9
immunosensors, however, there was no monotonic dependence on the concentration,
and a quantitative analysis cannot be performed. Also relevant is
the confirmation that CA19-9 was indeed adsorbed on the two film architectures,
as indicated in the spectra of Figure 5c.

Figure 5 (a) PM-IRRAS spectra for the PA6/PAH/MWCNTs/anti-CA19-9
and (b)
PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 architectures adsorbed on gold, before (black
line) and after exposure to CA19-9 at various concentrations (colored
lines). Baseline correction was performed by taking the spectra of
the PA6/PAH/MWCNTs and PA6/PAH/AuNPs architectures as the background.
(c) Adsorption of the antibodies on the PA6/PAH/MWCNTs and PA6/PAH/AuNPs
films is proven by comparing the spectra with and without CA19-9 antibody,
where the baseline correction was made using the gold substrate as
background.

A quantitative analysis
of the adsorption mechanisms is normally
made by plotting the so-called adsorption isotherms, that is, the
amount of adsorbed material versus the concentration of the adsorbate.
For biosensors, there is evidence that the change in impedance (or
capacitance) can be taken to be proportional to the mass of adsorbate.9,10,48 In spite of the size of the antigens
and complexity of antigen–antibody interactions, adsorption
isotherms for immunosensors have been modeled with the simple Langmuir–Freundlich
model,9,10 originally developed for the adsorption
of gas molecules on a surface. For the two nanofiber architectures
investigated here, we attempted to fit the calibration curves in Figure 1b,d with Langmuir
and Langmuir–Freundlich models available in the literature.50−54Equation 2 representing
the Langmuir–Freundlich model yielded a good fitting in Figure 1d for CA19-9 adsorption
on PA6/PAH/AuNPs/anti-CA19-9 architecture. 2  where q is taken as the amount
of adsorbed material on the substrate at an equilibrium, proportional
to the change in impedance, Qsat is the
adsorption capacity, K is the affinity constant for
adsorption, Ceq is the aqueous phase concentration
at equilibrium, and n is the index of heterogeneity.
In contrast, for PA6/PAH/MWCNT/anti-CA19-9 architecture, adsorption
of the CA19-9 biomarker in Figure 1b could only be achieved with a combination of two
Langmuir–Freundlich functions (eq 3) 3  where the symbols have
the same meaning as
in eq 2, now with the
subindices 1 and 2 denoting the two Langmuir–Freundlich processes.
With the data we have available, it is not possible to determine why
two adsorption processes are present before saturation. This result
for the architecture containing MWCNTs differs from all of the the
others reported in the literature, for which only one Langmuir–Freundlich
process is observed.

3 Conclusions
Electrospun
polymer nanofibers of PA6/PAH modified with either
MWCNTs or AuNPs were used as matrix for the immobilization of anti-CA19-9
antibodies, which served as immunosensors to detect CA19-9 biomarker
using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanostructured architectures
showed high sensitivity in detecting the commercial CA19-9 in a buffer
and for distinguishing blood serum samples of patients with distinct
concentrations of the biomarker. The three-dimensional structure of
the electrospun nanofibers, as revealed with SEM images, appears to
be relevant for the successful preservation of the antibody activity.
This high sensitivity and selectivity toward CA19-9 in the presence
of interferents may be attributed to the antibody–antigen irreversible
adsorption, which was confirmed here with PM-IRRAS spectroscopy in
which amide bands were affected by exposure of the immunosensors to
CA19-9. The adsorption process, in particular, is typical of Langmuir–Freundlich
processes. The clear distinction of blood serum samples of the patients
likely to develop pancreatic cancer from those with smaller CA19-9
concentrations, below the value considered as threshold (37 U mL–1), was achieved by treating the electrochemical impedance
data with a multidimensional projection technique. This is a limitation
of the present study because a calibration curve for a quantitative
analysis cannot be obtained in a straightforward manner. Future experiments
with a larger number of blood serum samples are therefore required
for generating sufficient data to which regression analysis methods
can be applied to yield a quantitative determination of CA19-9 concentrations.
An avenue will then be open for a simple, fast diagnosis of pancreatic
cancer at early stages using an immunosensor platform that can also
be utilized for other diseases.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of PA6 and PA6/PAH Nanofibers
Polyamide 6 (PA6), poly(allylamine) (PAH), and multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (MWCNTs) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibody
anti-CA19-9 and the antigen CA19-9 were purchased from Aviva System
Biology, whereas real samples of pancreatic cancer patients were provided
by Barretos Cancer Hospital. Sera from the pancreatic cancer patients
were quantified using the electrochemiluminescence analyzer model
Cobas 601 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis) and an Elecsys CA19-9
Immunoassay kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis). The use of patient
serum samples was approved by the Committees on Ethics in Research
of Barretos Cancer Hospital (Ethics Committee number 1.447.041).

PA6/PAH nanofibers were produced by the electrospinning technique
using a homemade apparatus from a solution of polymer blend composed
of 20% of PA6 (w/v in respect to the solvent) in formic acid and 30%
of PAH (w/w in respect to PA6). The solution was kept under magnetic
stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The applied voltage was 25 kV
and the distance between the needle (0.8 mm diameter) and the collector
was 3 cm. The ejection rate was set at 0.01 mL h–1. Random polymeric nanofibers were deposited on glass electrodes
coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine tin oxide attached
to the cylindrical collector rotating at a speed of 250 rpm. The amount
of nanofibers deposited onto the electrode was controlled by varying
the spinning time.23 The choice of these
parameters for obtaining the electrospun fibers was based on prior
works.23

4.2 Incorporation
of MWCNTs onto PA6/PAH Nanofibers
Surface
The electrospun nanofibers had their surface modified
with the adsorption of MWCNTs from a 0.5 mg mL–1 dispersion in an ultrapure water, adding Triton X-100 (0.3% w/v)
as a nonionic surfactant to improve dispersion, following the methodology
described by Mercante et al.23 The mixture
was sonicated with an ultrasonic apparatus in an ice bath with an
average power of 30 W for 120 min. After sonication, the PA6/PAH nanofibers
were immersed in MWCNTs dispersion for 30 min. The fibers were then
washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.23 A solution containing 0.1 mol L–1N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.1 mol L–1N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (1:1) was used for modifying the carboxylic
acid groups of MWCNTs to allow for the binding with the antibody
anti-CA19-9. Finally, the film was immersed into 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) to block nonspecific binding sites.

4.3 Adsorption
of Gold Nanoparticles onto PA6/PAH
Nanofibers Surface
In another type of functionalization employed,
PA6/PAH nanofibers were coated with a layer of gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs)23 (Figure 6). These citrate-functionalized AuNPs were
synthesized using the Turkevich method,55 in which 20 mL of 1 mM solution of HAuCl4 was heated
to 90 °C and 2 mL of 1% sodium citrate solution was added under
vigorous stirring and constant heating. The solution changed color
from yellowish (HAuCl4) to red, indicating the Au nanoparticle
formation. Heating was discontinued with continuous stirring of the
solution till room temperature. The nanofibers were immersed in the
solution of AuNPs for 12 h, and the nanoparticles were adsorbed onto
the nanofibers surface by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.23 The nanofibers were then washed with ultrapure
water and dried at room temperature. The same procedure as mentioned
above was performed with EDC/NHS to allow for the binding with the
antibody anti-CA19-9, followed by the incorporation of BSA.

gold nanoparticle.

4.4 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements
Detection of CA19-9 biomarker
was carried out using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy with the immunosensors manufactured as described
in the previous subsections. The immunosensors were exposed to different
concentrations of commercial CA19-9 biomarker for 10 min, followed
by washing for the removal of poorly adsorbed molecules. In another
set of experiments, the immunosensors were exposed to 4 blood serum
samples from the pancreatic cancer patients of Barretos Cancer Hospital
for 10 min, also followed by washing with PBS buffer. All of the experiments
were performed using a PGSTAT 204 Autolab system containing a thermostated
glass cell with a three-electrode configuration: ITO glass modified
with the nanofiber mats employed as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl
electrode as a reference, and platinum foil as auxiliary electrode.
The data were acquired in the frequency range between 1 and 106 Hz with a 10 mV amplitude.
