Stainless
steel is a ubiquitous structural material and one that
finds extensive use in core-internal components in nuclear power plants.
Stainless steel features superior corrosion resistance (e.g., as compared
to ordinary steel) due to the formation of passivating iron and/or
chromium oxides on its surfaces. However, the breakdown of such passivating
oxide films, e.g., due to localized deformation and slip line formation
following exposure to radiation, or aggressive ions renders stainless
steel susceptible to corrosion-related degradation. Herein, the effects
of alkali cations (i.e., K+, Li+) and the interactions
between the passivated steel surface and the solution are examined
using 304L stainless steel. Scanning electrochemical microscopy and
atomic force microscopy are used to examine the inert-to-reactive
transition of the steel surface both in the native state and in the
presence of applied potentials. Careful analysis of interaction forces,
in solution, within ≤10 nm of the steel surface, reveals that
the interaction between the hydrated alkali cations and the substrate
affects the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL). As a result,
a higher surface reactivity is indicated in the presence of Li+ relative to K+ due to the effects of the former
species in disrupting the EDL. These findings provide new insights
into the role of the water chemistry not only on affecting metallic
corrosion but also in other applications, such as batteries and electrochemical
devices.

==== Body
1 Introduction and Background
Corrosion-induced
degradation of core-internal components composed
of austenitic stainless steel in nuclear power plants often originates
from localized (pitting) corrosion and intergranular stress corrosion
cracking.1 The primary factors that contribute
to corrosion activity include: (1) exposure to halide ions (e.g.,
Cl–, F–) borne in the cooling
water, (2) irradiation-induced alterations of the microstructure of
stainless steel,2,3 and (3) cooling water chemistry
(e.g., pH, amounts of dissolved oxygen, and composition of cooling
water additives) all of which can act to enhance or inhibit corrosion
rates.4

Most often, studies of alloy
corrosion have focused on Cl– species due to their
well-known role in accelerating the decomposition
of the passivating oxide film, and thereby initiating corrosion.5−13 Three models have been proposed for oxide layer breakdown in the
presence of halides, namely,7 (1) the adsorption
model,8,9 in which adsorbed halides form a metal cation
complex within the oxide layer, which accelerates film removal, (2)
the penetration model,10,11 in which the penetration of halides
results in the formation of conductive pathways within the oxide film
that facilitate the transfer of metal cations from the surface into
the bulk, and (3) the film breakdown model,12,13 which suggests that the presence of adsorbed halides decreases the
surface tension of the oxide, resulting in its mechanical rupture.
These mechanisms are, however, applicable for systems involving a
halide ion and a well-oxidized substrate. However, finer-scale understanding
of the role of the accompanying (counter) cation on oxide film formation,
growth, and stability remain less understood.

In nuclear power
plants, lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is often used
as a coolant additive to facilitate alkalinization (pH = 6.9–7.4)4 and thereby retard alloy corrosion at subcritical
conditions.4,14−19 However, under the operational conditions expected to be employed
in the next generation of reactors, wherein temperature and pressure
are within the critical limit, decreases in water density have been
observed.4,20 This results in a continuous increase in
ionic association between Li+ and –OH
ions, making pH control difficult, thereby promoting oxide breakdown
and accelerating corrosion.4,14,21 Moreover, the concentration of Li+ ions in crevices,
leading to stress corrosion cracking of irradiated austenitic stainless
steel in pressurized water reactors, has also been reported.22 These issues highlight a need to better examine
alternative alkali hydroxides that will facilitate better pH control,
as opposed to LiOH, in nuclear reactors. Of particular interest is
KOH because the K+ ion has a smaller charge density compared
to Li+22 and therefore, it exhibits
a lower affinity for the negatively charged –OH
ion,24,25 making water chemistry control more manageable.
Moreover, KOH is substantially (at least 5 times)26 cheaper than LiOH and can be sourced much more readily
than nuclear-grade7 Li-hydroxide. As such,
the use of KOH as compared to LiOH would result in substantial reductions
in plant operational costs.

Herein, a combination of scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to examine the impact of
Li+ and K+ ions, for the first time, on the
surface reactivity of passivated 304L stainless steel. The results
offer new understanding of the role of (counter) cations, such as
Li+ and K+, in inhibiting or otherwise affecting
surface reactivities, an issue, which is of relevance to applications
ranging from cooling water chemistry and steel corrosion, to batteries
and other electrochemical devices.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Alkali Cations
on the Electrical
Double Layer and Interaction Forces
Attractive and repulsive
forces of interaction within a few nanometers away from a surface
(e.g., van der Waals, electrostatic, hydration), e.g., in the region
of the electrical double layer (EDL) can be estimated from the approach
curve as the silicon nitride lever (SNL) probe approaches the steel
surface.27Figure 1 shows that the approach force–distance
curve in KOH more closely resembles that in deionized (DI) water as
compared to LiOH, albeit with a positive minimum value, indicating
attraction of the silicon nitride probe toward the substrate within
8 nm of separation distance in DI water. This behavior in DI water
(measured pH = 5.8 at around 23 °C) is attributed to the attractive
force between the negatively charged silicon nitride tip at the relevant
solution pH28 and the unpassivated (although
oxidized) stainless steel surface, which exhibits a positive surface
charge at pH ≤ 7.8.48 The partial
tip–substrate attraction observed in 10 mM KOH solutions at
tip–substrate separation distances of ≤5 nm is due to
the interaction of the negatively charged silicon nitride tip with
the weakly hydrated K+ ions and is much less pronounced
compared with that observed in DI water because the increase in ion
concentration results in a decrease in the length scale dominated
by electrostatic attraction (i.e., due to compaction of the EDL).29

Figure 1 Representative force–distance (approach) curves
of a 304L
stainless steel substrate interacting with a silicon nitride lever
(SNL-C) probe (tip diameter ≈ 12 nm) at 23 ± 3 °C
in DI water, 10 mM KOH, and 10 mM LiOH solutions. The calculated Debye
length (λD) in the 10 mM solutions is around 3 nm.
In water, attraction between the negatively charged AFM tip and the
positively charged steel surface occurs within separation distances
of ≤8 nm. In KOH, both attraction and repulsion act on the
AFM tip at separation distances of ≤5 nm. However, at surface
separations >5 nm, repulsive forces are dominant due to both hydration
forces and the abundance of –OH ions on steel surfaces.
In LiOH, repulsive forces dominate both within and beyond 5 nm from
the surface. This greater degree of repulsion of the AFM probe is
consistent with the higher energy barrier to nanoscale structures30 presented by the layer of hydrated Li+ ions at the (steel–solution) interface.

Furthermore, the approach curve featured a region at separations
beyond 5 nm in which repulsive forces between the substrate and the
tip are indicated. This repulsion of the SNL probe at distances >5
nm is indicative of hydration forces27 and
may also reflect the abundance of hydroxide (−OH)
ions on the steel surface, which is expected in alkaline conditions
(≥pH 10).48 At lower ionic concentrations
(i.e., 10 mM), repulsive forces are typically attributed to hydration
instead of steric forces.29 On the other
hand, the interaction between the SNL probe and the substrate in LiOH
solutions both within and beyond 5 nm from the steel is dominated
by repulsive forces. The observed repulsion of the negatively charged
SNL probe upon approach suggests that the steel surface becomes increasingly
negatively charged in LiOH solutions, e.g., due to the presence of –OH ions contained within the hydration sphere of Li+. This greater degree of repulsion identified by the SNL probe
in LiOH solutions is consistent with the higher energy barrier to
nanoscale structures30 resulting from the
layer of hydrated Li+ ions that are present at the substrate–solution
interface.27,30

Small ions with high charge
density, like Li+, are commonly
referred to as kosmotropes (structure makers), whereas ions having
lower charge densities, such as K+, are chaotropes (structure
breakers), e.g., see Figure 2.23,31 Li+ features a greater hydration
energy (−515 kJ) compared to K+ (−312 kJ),32 thus forming a larger hydration sphere in water.23 Kosmotropes are attracted to hydrophilic surfaces
and repelled from hydrophobic ones.23,33 On the other
hand, chaotropes are relatively more attracted to hydrophobic surfaces
following the solubility rule that “like dissolves like”.23,31 This suggests that hydrated Li+ ions exhibit a stronger
ion–surface interaction with the hydrophilic steel surface,
resulting in ion adsorption and disruption of the EDL, a region consisting
of two oppositely charged layers at the interface of two different
phases in solution,33 that persists on
the surface of the steel. Figure 3 shows that the first layer of the EDL on stainless
steel is composed of the following: a positively charged surface due
to the work function difference between the steel and the solution;43 the Stern layer (∼1 nm thickness),34 which consists of the inner Helmholtz plane
(composed of counterions, e.g., –OH ions in alkaline
solutions, and solvent molecules, e.g., water); outer Helmholtz plane
(composed of hydrated cations attracted toward the surface); and the
diffuse layer (where ions and molecules feature higher mobility).33 Partial dehydration of the strongly hydrated
Li+ ions is suggested to occur on the water-deficient steel
surface although the first hydration sphere is retained.31 It is postulated that the dehydrated Li+ ions will acquire –OH ions (displaced from
the Stern layer35,36 after surface dehydration of
Li+ ions) from the steel surface and water molecules present
in the EDL. These actions induced by the presence of Li+ result in the disruption of the EDL, and local dealkalization of
the steel substrate resulting in the accelerated and enhanced interactions
between the substrate and the aqueous species viz-a-viz when K+ species are present, e.g., which may result in an enhanced
breakdown of the oxide film and Fe transport into solution over extended
time scales.

Figure 2 Representative illustrations of structures of: (a) bulk
water,
(b) strongly hydrated 4-coordinate Li+ ions (kosmotrope),
and (c) weakly hydrated 7-coordinate K+ ion (chaotrope).
This illustration is representative only and not drawn to scale.

Figure 3 Illustration of the structure of the electrical
double layer (EDL)
that forms on an (oxidized) steel surface in LiOH solutions. The dehydration
of Li+ ions results in the sorption of –OH species from the steel substrate and from adsorbed H2O molecules. These actions lead to: surface dealkalization (i.e.,
due to enrichment of H+ ions at the steel–solution
interface) and transport of the liberated (dissolved) Fe-species into
the bulk solution. The resulting force–distance curves can
be explained as follows: (1) the repulsion of the negatively charged
silicon nitride tip within a few nanometers from the steel surface
occurs due to the strong hydration forces surrounding the Li+ ions and an abundance of –OH ions, which shield
the positively charged metal surface. (2) When the AFM probe touches
the surface of the steel substrate, a repulsive contact force is observed
due to the overlapping molecular orbitals of the tip and substrate.27 Therefore, (1) and (2) result in an overall
(net) state of repulsive interaction.

Similar to Li+ species, hydrated K+ ions
also undergo changes in their hydration sphere as they come into contact
with the steel surface. However, unlike Li+, the ion–surface
interaction between the hydrophilic substrate and a chaotrope like
hydrated K+ ion is much weaker. Therefore, although hydrated
K+ ions will be incorporated into the EDL, this action
does not lead to a significant disruption of the EDL (see Figure 4). For example, since
it is known that the corrosion of stainless steel does not readily
occur in pure water due to the presence of an oxide film,33 it appears as though a lesser extent of disruption
of the EDL, as apparent in KOH solutions as compared to LiOH solutions,
signifies a condition that is suitable for the formation and maintenance
of a more compact EDL and a less reactive (more oxidized) surface.

Figure 4 Illustration
of the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL)
that forms on an (oxidized) steel surface in KOH solutions. The force–distance
curves can be explained as follows: (1) repulsion of the silicon nitride
probe is observed at tip–substrate separation distances >5
nm due to hydration forces presented by the hydrated K+ ions. These hydration forces are, however, weaker than those observed
in hydrated Li+ ions. (2) Both attractive and repulsive
forces act on the negatively charged SNL probe at distances of ≤5
nm from the steel surface because of interactions with the weakly
hydrated, positively charged K+ ions, and van der Waals
forces. (3) When the tip of the AFM probe touches the substrate, a
repulsive force is observed.

The collective of approach curves shown in Figure 1 were fitted using the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) approximation to estimate the surface potential/charge of stainless
steel in LiOH and KOH solutions. Two boundary conditions were used
to fit the approach curves: constant-potential (CP) and constant-charge
(CC). In the CP model, the surface potentials of the two opposing
surfaces are assumed to remain constant as they approach each other.
On the other hand, the surface charge densities of the opposing surfaces
remain constant in the CC model.31 In this
study, the values of the parameters (surface charge densities and
surface potentials of the AFM tip and substrate) were varied until
best fits to eqs 1 and 2 representing CC and CP boundary conditions, respectively,
were achieved. Both models, however, have the tendency to deviate
from experimental results especially at separation distances less
than 5 nm such that an underestimation of the observed force occurs,
particularly when van der Waals interactions are considered.37 This deviation has been attributed to the additional
repulsive force introduced by solvent ordering (hydration layers)
at the interface.32,37−40 This method of fitting resulted
in the following parameters: (1) surface charge density of the sample:
−0.35 C/m2, (2) surface charge density of the SNL
probe: −0.05 C/m2, and (3) electrical surface potential
of the SNL probe: −0.7 V. The estimated electric surface potentials
(i.e., the φ2)44 of 304L
stainless steel in 10 mM LiOH and KOH solutions were −0.21
± 0.005 and −0.19 ± 0.003 V, respectively, indicating
that the interaction between the stainless steel and SNL probe surfaces
is better rationalized using the CP boundary conditions. It should
be noted that the CP model provides a better approximation for conductive
(metallic) surfaces.46 Furthermore, the
CP model accurately represents the behavior of the force curves when
the surfaces of the tip and the substrate have potentials of the same
sign (i.e., negative). For example, repulsive interactions are observed
at large separations, which becomes attractive as the tip and substrate
approach each other.37 The more negative
surface potential that was calculated for stainless steel in LiOH
is consistent with the presence of higher amounts of negatively charged
species (e.g., –OH) within the hydration sphere
of Li+, as compared to K+, in the EDL. This
outcome is also in agreement with literature reports wherein the surface
potential of a negatively charged substrate (e.g., stainless steel)
is noted to increase in magnitude (more negative) with increasing
hydration radius of the electrosorbed cations (i.e., since hydration
radius of Li+ is larger than that of K+).34

2.2 Electrochemical Behavior
of Steel Surfaces
in the Presence of Alkali Cations
To validate the hypothesis
that surface oxidation is indeed inhibited by the presence of kosmotropes
(hydrated Li+ ions) and the associated disruption of the
EDL, potentiodynamic polarization and SECM analyses were carried out.
Anodic polarization of 304L stainless steel in 10 mM LiOH and KOH
solutions resulted in well-defined Tafel regions, as shown in Figure 5. The resulting plots
revealed that the calculated corrosion current density (icorr) under immersion in 10 mM LiOH is 2.03 × 10–7 A/cm2, which is slightly higher than that
in 10 mM KOH (icorr = 1.55 × 10–7 A/cm2). First, this identifies that acceleration
of the electrode–solution interaction rates occurs in the presence
of Li+. Second, the calculated corrosion potentials (Ecorr) in the LiOH and KOH solutions were identified
as −0.15 ± 0.005 and −0.18 ± 0.002 V (vs Ag/AgCl),
respectively. The lower Ecorr value in
KOH suggests a slower cathodic reaction (oxygen reduction),41 indicating the presence of a compact EDL (and
potentially, a better oxidized surface), is promoted in solutions
containing hydrated K+ ions as compared to those containing
hydrated Li+ species. On the other hand, identical anodic
behaviors were observed between the Li- and K-containing solutions
indicating similar anodic passivation processes. Note that Ecorr refers to the mixed potential that is dependent
on both the anodic and cathodic reactions42 and is distinct from the surface potential of the substrate determined
using DLVO analysis. Although the observed differences in the Tafel
polarization curves suggest that surface reactivity and consequently
the kinetics of cathodic reactions are indeed influenced by the EDL,
a definite conclusion regarding the effect of cations cannot be derived
due to the small difference between icorr and Ecorr assessed in relevant solutions.
Therefore, to acquire better evidence on the effect of alkali cations
on the oxidation of stainless steel, SECM studies were carried out
both in the presence and absence of applied potential.

Figure 5 Representative Tafel
plots generated via potentiodynamic polarization
of 304L stainless steel in 10 mM LiOH (red curve) and 10 mM KOH (dotted
blue curve) solutions. The corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (icorr) were determined from the intersection of the extrapolated
anodic and cathodic segments, which are shown by the dashed blue and
red lines, respectively.

Figure 6 shows
the
results of SECM experiments carried out at open circuit potential
(OCP) in feedback mode, with 1 mM FcMeOH as the redox mediator in
100 mM solutions of KOH and LiOH. The use of a redox mediator allowed
for the analysis of how the formation of an oxide layer may screen
the (initially) conductive steel surface. For example, a lower tip
current should be observed in the presence of a less reactive surface
because of the inhibited regeneration of the redox mediator (reduction
of Fc+) on the substrate. Interestingly, Figure 6 shows dramatic differences
in the initial currents observed in solutions of LiOH (4.5 ×
10–9 A) and KOH (0.7 × 10–9 A), e.g., due to the rapid surface oxidation of the steel surface
in KOH solutions. Indeed, a decrease in current from ∼2.0 ×
10–9 to ∼1.0 × 10–9 A was detected simply as the tip approached the surface (over a
period of seconds) consistent with the rapid formation of an oxide
film on stainless steel. It is therefore clarified that the higher
tip current measured in the presence of Li+ supports the
premise that kosmotropes, such as hydrated Li+ ions, perturb
the electric double layer resulting in a more cathodically charged
surface (e.g., see Figure 1). It should moreover be noted that even following extended
exposure, i.e., after 75 min, the tip current in the presence of 100
mM LiOH (3.5 × 10–9 A) remained nearly 6.5
times higher as compared to an isoconcentration solution of KOH (5.5
× 10–10 A). The evolution of the tip current
in both cases suggests the time-dependent growth and thickening of
the oxide layer.

Figure 6 Evolution of the tip current measured using a 10 μm
Pt ultramicroelectrode
on the surface of 304L stainless steel immersed in 100 mM hydroxide
solutions. The initial (and terminal, i.e., t = 75
min) currents measured in LiOH solutions are substantially higher
than in KOH solutions, suggesting that a more inert surface persists
in the latter case.

Next, the steel surface
was polarized to assess whether kosmotropes
may exhibit stronger ion–surface interaction with the substrate
as opposed to chaotropes. The application of a bias was used to evaluate
ion adsorption with applied potentials in the presence of Li+ and K+. This is based on the premise that in the presence
of a positive potential, facilitated electrosorption of –OH on the substrate should be favored. Therefore, a corresponding
current decrease should be observed similar to what has been observed
at open circuit potential. On the other hand, the application of a
negative potential should lead to the repulsion of –OH and attraction of the alkali cations toward the substrate and
also result in the enhanced reduction of the redox mediator (FcMeOH).
The change in tip current with respect of the applied potential offers
insight into the strength of ion–surface interaction. For example,
if hydrated Li+ sorbs on the surface more strongly than
hydrated K+, a higher anodic potential would be needed
in LiOH solutions because of the greater driving force needed to remove
the strongly adsorbed hydrated Li+ ions from the surface
before the adsorption of –OH ions can occur.

The OCP measured in both LiOH and KOH solutions following 10 min
of immersion was around ∼−0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. As shown
in Figure 7, polarization
to more positive regions of static potential (E ≥
−0.4 V) resulted in a decrease in tip current consistent with
the inhibited reduction of FcMeOH at the surface. It should be noted
that independent of the application of potentials that are either
more positive or more negative compared to the OCP, the tip current
plateaued faster in KOH than in LiOH solutions. This supports the
observations in Figure 6, i.e., the rate of oxide formation is faster in KOH solutions even
in the presence of an applied bias. Further, a much lower potential
was needed in KOH (0 V) than in LiOH (0.2 V) to facilitate a decrease
to a limiting current of ∼1.2 × 10–10 A. This suggests inhibited surface reactivity in the presence of
KOH because hydrated K+ ions exhibit a weaker interaction
with the surface and therefore perturb the EDL to a much lesser degree,
compared to hydrated Li+ ions. Taken together, these SECM
results support the premise of the AFM force spectroscopy studies
and validate our hypothesis that hydrated Li+ ions (kosmotropes)
interrupt the EDL, and compete with –OH ions for
adsorption at the surface of the substrate, resulting in enhanced
surface reactivity of the stainless steel when such cations may be
present.a

Figure 7 Representative plot of the tip current
as a function of the applied
potential. The open circuit potential (OCP) is represented by the
dashed line. Herein, potentials were applied in the following order:
(1) OCP (−0.4 V), (2) −0.3 V, (3) −0.5 V, (4)
−0.2 V, (5) −0.6 V, (6) −0.1 V, (7) 0 V, (8)
0.1 V, (9) 0.2 V. Each applied potential was held for 5 min or until
the rate of change in the tip current as a function of time (dI/dt) was less than 1.0 × 10–11 A/min indicating near-equilibrium conditions. It is seen that in
the presence of increasingly positive applied potentials, the tip
current exponentially decayed to a limiting value in KOH, suggesting
inhibited surface reaction kinetics.

3 Summary and Conclusions
The influence
of Li+ and K+ species on the
surface reactivity of 304L stainless steel was investigated using
a pioneering combination of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy analysis.
Critical analysis of the force curves was used to reveal fine-scale
insights into interactions of the hydrated alkali cations with the
passivated stainless steel surface. Specifically, repulsion of the
negatively charged silicon nitride probe was observed as it approached
the substrate in the presence of both hydrated Li+ and
K+ ions. However, attractive forces emerged within 5 nm
of the surface in KOH solutions, but not in LiOH solutions. These
observations offer evidence of the greater extent of shielding of
the positively charged substrate due to ion–surface interaction
between the hydrophilic stainless steel and the hydrated Li+ ions (kosmotrope), as compared to that with hydrated K+ ions (chaotrope). Analysis of the force curves within the framework
offered by the DLVO approximation revealed that the surface potential
of stainless steel in LiOH was more negative than in KOH, consistent
with the dominance of repulsive forces observed in the former case.
These observations arise because as hydrated Li+ ions adsorb
on the surface of stainless steel, they dehydrate (i.e., forego solvated
water). To ensure charge compensation, the dehydrated Li+ ions preferentially adsorb –OH from H2O molecules sited on the surface and within the EDL thereby resulting
in the disruption of the EDL. This concept was validated by SECM analyses,
which confirmed that the ability of the steel surface in LiOH solutions
to promote redox reactions is indeed higher as compared to that in
KOH solutions, as evidenced by the higher currents of FcMeOH measured
both at open circuit and in the presence of an applied potential.
The outcomes provide direct evidence regarding the potentially detrimental
effects of Li+ on stainless steel by facilitating surface
reactions (e.g., corrosion), which therefore warrants further studies
of water chemistry control in conditions of relevance to nuclear power
plants (e.g., with irradiation exposure under superheated conditions).
On a broader level, these findings provide critical insights regarding
cation–surface interactions beyond corrosion, as relevant to
applications including the development of high-performing, durable
electrodes, which may find use in batteries and electrocatalysts.

4 Materials and Methods
Reagent grade lithium hydroxide
(LiOH; Fisher Scientific, anhydrous),
potassium hydroxide (KOH; Fisher Scientific, 88.5%), and ferrocenemethanol
(FcMeOH; C11H12FeO; Alfa Aesar, 97%) were used.
Deionized (DI) water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q Integral
water purification system (>18 MΩ cm).

Commercially
available 304L stainless steel (McMaster-Carr) was
sectioned into coupons having dimensions of 1.2 cm × 0.8 cm ×
0.3 cm (length × width × height) using a low-speed precision
saw (Buehler, IsoMet 1000). The nominal composition (in mass %) of
the steel, as provided by the supplier is Fe (70.89%), C (0.016%),
Mn (1.77%), P (0.029%), S (0.001%), Si (0.26%), Cr (18.18%), Ni (8.02%),
Mo (0.35%), Cu (0.39%), and N (0.090%). The solution-annealed steel
samples (with an average grain size of around 40 μm) were embedded
in epoxy resin, which was allowed to cure overnight at room temperature.
The samples were then polished using 400-, 600-, 800-, and 1200-grit
sandpaper, followed by 3 and 1 μm diamond pastes and finally
with 0.05 μm colloidal silica suspension until they featured
a surface roughness on the order of Sz = 2 nm. In general, the samples were rinsed with DI water and then
with ethanol prior to switching to the next polishing material to
minimize contamination. This step was followed by ultrasonication
in acetone and in isopropanol, each for 30 s, and drying with a stream
of ultrahigh purity nitrogen gas.

4.1 Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM)
Force
spectroscopy was carried out in contact mode using a Bruker FastScan
AFM to investigate the perturbation of the electrical double layer
(EDL) caused by hydrated Li+ and K+ ions present
on the steel surface. Special focus was paid to monitor the attractive
and repulsive forces of interaction (i.e., between the substrate and
the AFM tip in the presence of electrosorbed ions and the bulk solution)
that are inferred from the deflection of the cantilever as a function
of tip–substrate separation. As such, force spectroscopy was
carried out, in solution, on 304L stainless steel coupons that were
immersed in DI water or 10 mM solutions of LiOH or KOH.

A silicon
nitride lever (Bruker, SNL-C) probe with a silicon nitride tip diameter
of 12 nm (i.e., estimated using scanning electron microscopy) was
used. Surface mapping was carried out in contact mode in deionized
water wherein nine different locations, well-separated from each other,
were selected for force spectroscopy measurements. The interaction
forces were measured by bringing the SNL-C probe into contact with
the substrate. Fifty ramps were performed at each point (450 ramps
per run) using a ramp size of 500 nm and a tip velocity of 420 nm/s.
The surface of the substrate was rigorously flushed with DI water,
and force–distance curves were acquired (i.e., to ensure that
the flushed surface’s response matched that of a pristine surface
in contact with DI water) before switching to another metal hydroxide
solution. The force curves were processed using the Bruker NanoScope
Analysis software (v.1.8) to convert the curves from deflection–height
diagrams to force–separation (F–D) diagrams using the deflection sensitivity (137.7 nm/V)
and spring constant (0.3839 N/m) measured under immersion. All AFM
measurements were performed at 23 ± 2 °C.

The interaction
forces between the tip and the steel surface can
be analyzed within the framework of the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey,
and Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which predicts the net interaction between
two charged surfaces and provides an estimate of the forces of interaction.
The forces herein include a combination of van der Waals and electrostatic
(i.e., due to double layer contributions) at various separation distances
between two surfaces.45 To provide an approximation
of the forces of interaction between the conical tip and the planar
substrate, the force–distance curves were fitted using models
for constant-charge (CC) and the constant-potential (CP) boundary
conditions, respectively.46,47 The CC (eq 1) and CP (eq 2) equations are expressed as follows46 1   2  where D is the separation
distance between the tip and the substrate (in nm); R is the tip radius (in nm); σT and σS are the surface charge densities of the AFM probe and substrate
(in C/m2), respectively; ψT and ψS are the surface potentials of the AFM probe and substrate
(in V), respectively; ε is the dielectric constant of the medium
(78.54 for an aqueous electrolyte solution);46 ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 ×
10–12 F/m); A is the Hamaker constant (2.88 ×
10–19 J);48 and λD is the Debye length (3 nm for 10 mM 1:1 symmetric electrolyte
containing LiOH and KOH as estimated from the ionic strength46). It should be noted that the DLVO fitting is
only valid at distances greater than around 6 nm because of hydration
forces and the finite size of ions.49 Therefore,
fits were performed over separation distances of 7–70 nm from
the surface.

4.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization
Anodic
polarization of stainless steel coupons was carried out in 10 mM solutions
of LiOH and KOH using a HEKA PG-618 potentiostat. A Ag/AgCl electrode
and a Pt (platinum) wire were used as reference and counter electrodes,
respectively. The potential was linearly swept from −0.4 to
+0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 0.17 V/s. The corresponding
Tafel plots were generated by plotting the applied potential versus
the logarithm of the current density. From these plots, the corrosion
potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current
density (icorr) were determined using
the points of intersection of the extrapolated linear cathodic and
anodic Tafel segments. All experiments were performed at 23 ±
3 °C.b

4.3 Scanning
Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM)
The effects of Li+ and K+ ions on the formation,
stability, and decomposition of the oxide film were evaluated using
a HEKA ElProScan SECM in feedback mode, using 1 mM ferrocenemethanol
(FcMeOH, C11H12FeO) as the redox mediator. The
background solutions used consisted of 100 mM KOH and LiOH. The use
of alkali hydroxides instead of chloride solutions ensured that halide-induced
effects (e.g., inhibition of oxide formation and degradation of the
passive film) will not occur and that any observed difference in the
behavior of the overlayer can be attributed directly to the alkali
cation of interest. It should be noted that although the concentrations
used herein (100 mM) are higher than that used in nuclear plants,
this selection was made to induce measurable changes, expediently,
at ambient temperature.

The reference electrode used was Ag/AgCl,
and the counter electrode consisted of a Pt wire. A potential of +0.4
V vs Ag/AgCl was applied to oxidize ferrocene (C10H10Fe) to the ferrocenium ion ([C10H10Fe]+) at the tip of the Pt ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME).
In this setup, the ferrocenium ion produced at the UME tip is reduced
back to ferrocene at the surface of a conductive substrate. This continuous
regeneration of the redox mediator results in an increasing tip current
as the electrode approaches a reactive surface. On the other hand,
a decrease in tip current is observed in the proximity of inert substrates
due to reduced regeneration and diffusion of the redox mediator to
the Pt UME tip.51

The SECM when operated
in constant distance mode allows for the
interpretation of electrochemical signals independent from local topography
by controlling the tip-to-substrate separation using the feedback
response.52−54 The basis of such measurements is as follows. The
application of an alternating potential to the diether (stimulation)
piezo results in the oscillation of the UME. As the UME tip approaches
the surface of the substrate, shear force damping is observed resulting
in amplitude and phase (frequency) shifts of the oscillation of receiver
piezo.55 The amplitude (in mV) and frequency
(in kHz) set points can be determined by comparing the frequency spectra
collected on the surface of the substrate and in bulk solution (i.e.,
≥10 μm above the surface). The frequency used herein
was 365 kHz and the amplitude set point was 10 mV, which was 10% of
the change in amplitude when the UME was retracted by 3 μm from
the surface of the substrate. Following so, the tip current of the
10 μm Pt UME as it contacts the 304L stainless steel surface
was measured. All experiments were performed at 23 ± 3 °C.

a Contrastingly, analysis of the 304L
stainless steel surfaces using electrical impedance spectroscopy and
equivalent circuit modeling indicated very similar characteristics
of the oxidized steel surface in the presence of both LiOH and KOH
solutions. This may indicate a need for spatially localized, as opposed
to bulk analysis of reacting surfaces to better elucidate the effects
of solvent chemistry on surface reactivity.

b It should be noted that although these
studies were carried at ambient temperatures, they offer a reliable
model for systems at high(er) temperatures because the ionic association
between Li+ and –OH remains substantially
higher than that between K+ and –OH even
at room temperature.50
