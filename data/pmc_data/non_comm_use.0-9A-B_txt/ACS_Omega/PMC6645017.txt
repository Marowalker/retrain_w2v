The conversion reaction is important
in lithium-ion batteries because
it governs the overall battery performance, such as initial Coulombic
efficiency, capacity retention, and rate capability. Here, we have
demonstrated in situ observation of the complete conversion reaction
and agglomeration of nanoparticles (NPs) upon lithiation by using
graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. The observation
reveals that the Sn NPs are nucleated from the surface of SnO2, followed by merging with each other. We demonstrate that
the agglomeration has a stepwise process, including rotation of a
NP, formation of necks, and subsequent merging of individual NPs.

Introduction
The conversion reaction
(Mz+Xy + zLi+ ↔ M + yLiz/yX, where M and X represent
the cation and anion, respectively) is a ubiquitous lithiation phenomenon
in electrode materials, including metal oxides, sulfides, fluorides,
and nitrides.1−3 The conversion process in these electrodes is pivotal
as it affects the initial Coulombic efficiencies, cycle retention,
and reversibility of batteries.4,5 Recently, it has been
proposed from the literature6−8 that additional capacity can arise
from the electrode materials that undergo the conversion reaction,
which brings more potential for utilizing conversion reaction-based
electrode materials, giving strong potential for application for practical
rechargeable batteries. Along with the conversion reaction, the agglomeration
of electrode materials is another important factor because it is a
frequent phenomenon among nanoparticles (NPs) when used as electrodes.9−13 Agglomeration of NPs occurs inevitably and leads to decreased surface
areas and structural degradation, resulting in severe capacity fading.4 Fundamental understanding of how the conversion
reaction and agglomeration takes place on NPs is critical for providing
new insights on the advanced electrode designs, but some challenges
still remain for the direct observation of NPs under lithiation in
commercial liquid electrolyte.

Recent development of in situ
transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) enables direct observation of morphological and phase transitions
of nanostructured electrodes, which is suitable to analyze reaction
mechanisms during lithiation.14−17 Among these in situ TEM techniques, graphene liquid
cell (GLC) TEM is a versatile tool to observe lithiation dynamics
of various electrodes in liquid electrolyte while maintaining high
resolution.18,19 This technique enables not only
dipping NPs of active materials into liquid electrolytes but also
lithiation of electrodes with electrons for imaging.

Using GLC-TEM,
here, we first demonstrate both conversion and agglomeration
dynamics of SnO2 NPs, one of the highly researched materials
for a lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode.18 From the comparison of in situ GLC-TEM of NPs, with ex situ TEM
images taken from the electrode after electrochemical lithiation,
we verified reliability of the GLC-TEM technique.

Results and Discussion
Conversion
Dynamics and Growth of Sn
A schematic illustration
on how SnO2 NPs are encapsulated inside the GLC upon e-beam
irradiation and the elemental distribution inside the GLC are shown
in Figure 1. For the
electrolytes, solvent mixture of ethylene carbonates (EC) and diethyl
carbonates (DEC) with a volume ratio of 3:7 in addition to 10 wt %
of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) with 1.3 M lithium hexafluorophosphate
(LiPF6) was used. It is important to highlight the role
of the imaging electron on the reaction: when high energy (300 kV
in this work) electrons irradiate the solution, both primary and secondary
scattering take place.20 In the case of
the complex organic electrolyte system, the radicals and solvated
electrons generated from different scatterings interact with Li salt
and electrolyte through a secondary chemical reaction.20 As a result, upon e-beam irradiation, electrons
are supplied from the e-beam and LiPF6 is decomposed into
LiF and PF5 in the electrolyte,19,20 where LiF can further decompose to produce Li+ by e-beam
irradiation.19,21 As the graphene synthesized from
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has no defects or functional groups
on the surface, it is suggested that its inert surface has minimal
chemical and physical interactions with encapsulated electrolyte or
NPs. In addition, using graphene sheets minimizes charging and heating
effects under the electron beam, as they have excellent electrical
and thermal conductivity.22 GLC is stable
upon e-beam irradiation both at 200 and 300 kV,18,19,23 which shows that in situ TEM observation
using GLC can be conducted for a considerable duration of time. Additionally,
it was suggested from previous work18 that
enough liquid can be encapsulated inside the graphene sheets (larger
than 500 nm in diameter), so enough liquid electrolyte can be present
inside the graphene sheets to trigger lithiation. As a result, in
situ TEM observation of lithiation behavior was successfully observed
by using GLC, as shown in the illustration (Figure 1a) and in previous works.18,19

Annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(ADF-STEM)
images and transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) mapping of as-encapsulated SnO2 NPs
inside the GLC are shown in Figure 1b, where SnO2 NPs are distributed inside
the GLC. Energy electron loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping of Li, which
are dispersed in the electrolytes between the graphene sheets, was
also characterized (Figure S1). Each element
was located in the suitable position, where O, F, C, P, and Li were
present in different parts, but Sn was selectively present in the
part where SnO2 NPs were present. SnO2 NPs had
various sizes (10–25 nm) and shapes, and the crystal structure
of SnO2 was the cassiterite structure, confirmed by the
selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
(Figure S2), showing the well-defined polycrystalline
structure.

General processes in the conversion dynamics of SnO2 NPs take place inside the GLC, which are shown in Figure 2. In the initial
stage of lithiation
(Figure 2a), it can
be seen that some Sn NPs were nucleated from the surface of SnO2, as Li reacts with SnO2 to form Sn, according
to the chemical reaction (4Li+ + 4e– +
SnO2 → 2Li2O + Sn). To initially confirm
whether those NPs that were initially formed on the surface of SnO2 were Sn, we conducted another in situ TEM observation by
GLC and took the HRTEM image in the boundary of SnO2 and
the nucleated NPs (Figure S3). As evidenced
by the HRTEM image, the small NPs were Sn, which were on the surface
of SnO2. Sn NPs were selected from snapshots of the real-time
movie, and they were clearly distinguishable because their size (initially,
2–3 nm) was much smaller than that of SnO2 NPs (∼20
nm). It is interesting to note that as-formed Sn NPs were all moving
along the surface of SnO2 NPs, without using the pathway
in the electrolyte and within the vacant sites inside the SnO2 NPs. It is suggested that the motion of weakly bounded NPs
inside the liquid is the main driving force for such motion, as shown
in the previous in situ TEM work using liquid solution.24,25 The weakly bound NPs show different movement compared to that of
freely moving NPs inside the liquid. Such difference comes from NPs’
movement that is weakly bound to the surface of the window membrane
or other nearby particles, where the movement of those NPs is significantly
limited. In our case, because Sn NPs do not freely move inside the
liquid but move along the surface of SnO2 NPs, this can
be considered as the motion of weakly bounded NPs. The two-dimensional
diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated as 0.47
nm2 s–1 from the equation D = ⟨x2⟩/4t, where ⟨x2⟩ represents
the mean-square displacement and t represents the
time. The calculated value (0.47 nm2 s–1) was not much different from the value (0.165–0.268 nm s–1) measured in the previous literature, with Au NPs
of 5–15 nm, as indicated from the study.25

conversion reaction, where Sn NPs move along the amorphous shell to
be attached to another Sn NP along the surface. (b) Trajectories of
red, green, and blue particle motion in the solution based on the

region (inset: fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of Sn NP), confirming

To visualize the motion of Sn
NPs, two-dimensional trajectories
of three Sn NPs in GLC (indicated as red, blue, and green) are shown
(Figure 2b). Considering
time-series images and trajectories, it can be summarized that Sn
NPs generated from the conversion reaction randomly move along the
surface of SnO2 NPs and merge when they are in contact
with one another.

In addition, the amorphous shell was formed
on the surface of SnO2 NPs (Figure S4a,b), which is confirmed
as LixO (Figure S4c), as the EELS spectrum of both Li2O and Li2O2 had similar peaks (Figure S5). Previously, it has been reported that diffusion of Li takes place
in an amorphous LixO matrix,26 as there are enough defects for Li ions to pass
through. Additionally, the broad peaks at 61–62 and 65–69
eV in Figure S4c suggest that LiF was also
formed along with LixO, indicating the
formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.18 Upon the formation of the SEI layer, Li ions
can also penetrate and react with SnO2, where the conversion
reaction continues to take place. As lithiation proceeds, the amorphous
shell is formed into a denser and uniformly distributed layer, as
shown at 416 s (Figure S4a). Although it
was previously reported that such an intermediate interface was presumed
to be that of Sn, Li, and O,26 we were
able to identify the chemical composition of the layer through EELS
analysis. It was confirmed from the EELS spectrum that the chemical
composition of the amorphous layer was LixO, which is in agreement with the previous literature.26 To examine the origin of LixO, the Li salt was dissolved in the electrolyte upon e-beam
irradiation and both high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission
electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and the EELS spectrum were
taken (Figure S6). In contrast to the EELS
spectrum in Figure S4c, the overall peak
locations were different (having two peaks at 61 and 69 eV). This
is attributed to the formation of LiF as a result of the decomposition
of LiPF6 upon e-beam irradiation, in agreement with the
previous literature.18 The results demonstrate
that the decomposition product of Li salt is somewhat different from
the chemical composition of the amorphous layer, where the amorphous
layer was formed as a result of the conversion reaction.

As
lithiation proceeds, more Sn NPs are formed in different places
and they themselves begin to agglomerate with each other (Figure 2c). At 411 s, more
Sn NPs are nucleated, which are mostly fixed in the amorphous matrix.
At 876 s, it can be shown that the average size of Sn NPs increased
compared with that at 411 s, which suggests that growth of Sn NPs
occurred, and as time passes through 1201 and 1540 s, it is seen that
even larger Sn NPs are formed, suggesting that agglomeration of Sn
NPs has certainly taken place. Along with the agglomeration of Sn
NPs, it is also important to note that in the observation time range
of 411 to 1201 s, more Sn NPs are still formed as a result of the
conversion reaction, where coexistence of Sn NPs and SnO2 NPs is actually visible in the HRTEM image (Figure S7). Eventually, at 1540 s, almost all of SnO2 NPs have been converted to Sn NPs, where some Sn NPs are almost
connected to each other, which demonstrate that agglomeration of Sn
NPs continues throughout the whole process of lithiation. Such agglomerated
Sn NPs are mostly embedded within the amorphous matrix, where they
have about 5–15 nm diameter with a spherical shape, as shown
in Figure 2d. From
the HRTEM analysis, it was shown that the crystal structure of precipitated
Sn NPs was tetragonal β-Sn (confirmed by the fast Fourier transform
(FFT) pattern), which is in good agreement with the previously reported
work.27 The phase transition of SnO2 NPs from SnO2 to Sn in the process of lithiation
has also been confirmed by time-series SAED patterns (Figure S8), where SnO2 initially present
at 0 s underwent progressive phase transition to β-Sn as time
proceeded, leading to complete β-Sn at 1800 s. At 1200 s, both
SnO2 and Sn exist together, which suggests that in the
intermediate stage of the conversion reaction, Sn NPs exist as a result
of the conversion reaction, whereas some SnO2 NPs yet remain.

To quantitatively examine how the growth of Sn NPs occurs on a
specific time scale, the number and average size of Sn NPs present
in the snapshots of the in situ TEM observation shown in Figure 2a,c were calculated
every 30 s during observation, from 60 to 1560 s (Figure 2e). On the basis of the calculated
data, it can be suggested that different morphological and phase transitions
were present with respect to the observation time. From about 60 to
450 s, the nucleation of Sn NPs is predominant, where the number of
Sn NPs significantly increases with respect to the observation time,
but the average size of Sn NPs barely increases. Then, from about
450 to 1350 s, the nucleation and growth of Sn NPs occur simultaneously,
where some Sn NPs are still formed because some remaining SnO2 NPs undergo the conversion reaction, but at the same time
some Sn NPs are attached to other Sn NPs to be merged into larger
Sn NPs. Considering the fact that as-formed Sn NPs have diameters
between 2 and 3 nm, although some agglomerated Sn NPs may have larger
diameters, formation of many new Sn NPs results in continued growth
in average diameter of Sn NPs, where more Sn NPs are agglomerated
and formed into larger NPs as time proceeds. The number of Sn NPs
somewhat decreases and increases from one to another time scale, demonstrating
that the formation of new Sn NPs and merging of Sn NPs into larger
Sn NPs happen simultaneously.

From 1350 s, almost all SnO2 NPs underwent the conversion
reaction, where only Sn NPs and the amorphous matrix are present.
The number of Sn NPs decreases as agglomeration of Sn NPs continues
to take place, and the average size of Sn NPs steadily increases with
the existence of larger Sn NPs. On the other hand, in contrast to
the observation shown from the above time series, in TEM images of
SnO2, the time-series TEM observation of SnO2 NPs in the electrolytes without LiPF6 showed no distinct
morphological evolution (Figure S9). The
results suggest that LiPF6 acted as a Li source to trigger
lithiation in our case of study, where without LiPF6, there
is no source to trigger such a lithiation process. On the basis of
the previous works,18−20 it is suggested that the presence of salt (LiPF6) triggers decomposition of electrolytes, where the decomposition
of organic solvents does not necessarily occur without the presence
of the salt. Without using LiPF6, such phase evolution
and growth of Sn NPs do not occur, which excludes the possibility
that it is the organic electrolyte that contributes to the dynamical
changes of SnO2 NPs.

On the basis of the trends in
the number of Sn NPs and the average
size of Sn NPs, kinetics of the conversion process can further be
elucidated (Figure S10). On the basis of
the growth of Sn NPs, it can be divided into two different regions
(region I and region II). In the first region (marked as region I),
nucleation of NPs is dominant. The size of Sn NPs increases proportionally
to t1/30 (here, time is denoted as t), which means that very slow increase in the size of Sn
NPs takes place. The second region (marked as region II), however,
shows a growth-dominant behavior. The size of Sn NPs increases proportionally
to t1/2, which corresponds to a reaction-limited
growth according to the Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner theory,
as shown in the previous literature.28 Nevertheless,
the number of Sn NPs decreases after 600 s, which also suggests that
the overall growth process of Sn NPs during the conversion reaction
is a complicated system that starts from nucleation to a reaction-limited
growth, in addition to the coalescence of Sn NPs.

HRTEM Analysis
on the Coalescence of Sn
Regarding the
details on how the coalescence of Sn NPs progresses, time-series HRTEM
images were taken to show the different stages for the coalescence
of two individual Sn NPs (Figure 3). At 0 s, the upper and bottom NPs were in random
contact, where each of them was positioned in a different orientation.
Up to 30 s, the upper NPs rotated and both NPs’ (200) plane
was visible because they were not in same orientation. At 46 s, the
neck was formed between two NPs on the (200) plane, which acted as
diffusion path for Sn atoms. It is important to note that favorable
planes for neck formation are known to occur in planes having the
lowest surface energy because for metallic NPs, coalescence of NPs
usually happens in the planes of the lowest surface energy.22,29 For face centered cubic NPs,22 the lowest
surface energy is on {111} planes, so their necking and coalescence
proceed on {111} planes. For the β-Sn structure, because it
is tetragonal, it has the lowest surface energy on the {100}30 plane, so neck formation and merging of two
NPs occur on {200} plane, and as a result, at 151 s, two NPs were
completely merged into one NP. Compared with the recently published
work that also observed the coalescence of two NPs,29 this work has two important advancements in (i) the atomic
scale observation of coalescence of NPs upon lithiation and (ii) initial
report on the coalescence of tetragonal NPs.

Figure 3 Time-series HRTEM images
showing the process of coalescence of
two Sn NPs. Initially, rotation of planes is visible. As time proceeds,
through necking and merging of individual NPs, two Sn NPs eventually
coalesce into one Sn NP.

Overall Conversion and Agglomeration Dynamics
The schematic
design is illustrated in Figure 4 that depicts the overall conversion and agglomeration
dynamics of NPs. Upon e-beam irradiation, the amorphous shell is formed
on the surface of SnO2 NPs, where Sn NPs having few nanometers
are formed as a result of the conversion reaction with the amorphous
matrix. Some of the Sn NPs that are formed on the surface of SnO2 NPs then move along the amorphous shell until they reach
the location at which a nearby Sn NP is present. Sn NPs are then attached
to each other and become one NP. As lithiation proceeds, more Sn NPs
are formed and are bonded together, mainly by coalescence. At the
end of the conversion state, SnO2 is completely transformed
into Sn, where much larger Sn NPs are positioned in the amorphous
matrix, as explained in the previous literature.31 The dominant driving force for the agglomeration of Sn
NPs was moderate coalescence, but additional driving forces, such
as monomer attachment and Ostwald ripening, were also occasionally
present (Figure S11), similar to what was
reported in the previous work.32 For instance,
the individual monomer (atom or few atoms) moves (820 s) and is attached
to nearby NPs (1040 s), resulting in the growth of Sn NPs. In addition,
Ostwald ripening takes place: small NPs disappear and a large NP grows,
where small NP once present at 798 s is absent at 1227 s. To sum up,
the usual occurrence of Sn NP coalescence along with the occasional
occurrence of monomer attachment and Ostwald ripening contributed
to the agglomeration of Sn NPs.

Figure 4 Schematics of the overall conversion and
agglomeration process.
Upon initial lithiation of SnO2, a thin amorphous shell
was initially formed, with the nucleation of Sn NPs, some of which
move along the surface to be attached to other Sn NPs. As lithiation
proceeds, more Sn NPs are formed and they subsequently undergo coalescence
to be merged into larger Sn NPs, which are positioned in the amorphous
matrix.

Comparative Ex Situ Analysis
and Evaluation of Study
It is important to highlight that
in situ TEM observations shown
in this study are similar to the actual reaction products of SnO2 NPs under the electrochemical reaction. One of the possible
drawbacks of GLC is the unrealistic observation caused by lithiation
from e-beam rather than the applied bias, although both ways can allow
the charge transport to undergo the dynamical changes upon lithiation.
In addition, there are other possible limitations in utilizing GLC
for in situ TEM observation, as there are no counter electrodes. To
confirm whether the in situ TEM observation using GLC is in good agreement
with the actual observation in electrochemical cells, in situ TEM
images were compared with ex situ TEM images of coin cells that were
tested under electrochemical conditions (Figure 5). Electrochemical testing was conducted
for SnO2 as the electrode for LIBs in 2032 coin-type half
cells containing Li metal as the reference electrode. The formation
cycle was run, which is the initial step of electrochemical testing.
Charge and discharge profiles of SnO2 NPs are shown in Figure 5a, where it shows
that the plateau region is at 0.85 V. The presence of the plateau
means that the two-phase reactions are taking place at a designated
voltage, where reduction of SnO2 to Sn takes place, in
agreement with the previous literature.31,33 From this
understanding, for the ex situ TEM analysis, the cell undergoing the
electrochemical test was stopped at 0.85 V and the electrode containing
SnO2 NPs was taken from the cell. Examinations of both
in situ and ex situ TEM images before the lithiation (blue box) and
after the conversion reaction (red box) were used for comparison of
the GLC and coin cell (Figure 5b), where they were in good agreement. Before lithiation,
both in situ and ex situ TEM images showed multiple SnO2 NPs, which were connected to each other. After the conversion reaction
(red box), both in situ and ex situ TEM images showed a number of
Sn NPs, where the general morphology of Sn NPs shown in in situ TEM
images is very similar to that in ex situ TEM images.

Figure 5 (a) Charge and discharge
profile of the SnO2 NPs under
electrochemical lithiation and (b) comparison of in situ and ex situ
TEM images of SnO2 NPs before lithiation (blue box) and
after the conversion reaction (red box). (c) Comparison of SAED patterns
of SnO2 NPs under GLC and the electrochemical system before
lithiation (blue) and after the conversion reaction (red box). Both
in situ and ex situ TEM images are in good agreement, which suggests
that in situ TEM observation using GLC is a reliable way to observe
phase transition.

Furthermore, SAED patterns
(Figure 5c) of SnO2 NPs both before lithiation and
after the conversion reaction in the GLC and coin cell with electrochemical
testing have confirmed the presence of SnO2 (cassiterite)
and Sn (β-Sn), respectively. Additionally, to confirm whether
the reaction pathways of SnO2, as shown in this in situ
TEM observation, are similar to those under the real electrochemical
reaction, we have conducted the ex situ TEM analysis (Figure S12) of electrodes before lithiation,
at 0.9 V (in the middle of the conversion reaction) and 0.85 V (last
stage of the conversion reaction). Similar to what was observed in
the in situ TEM observation, the reaction proceeded from the formation
of Sn NPs and the overall conversion of SnO2 to Sn as the
electrochemical reaction took place. This demonstrates that the observation
we have taken through TEM by using GLC is in good agreement with actual
electrochemical reaction products. To investigate the conversion reaction
at each stage, along with ex situ TEM analysis, Raman spectroscopy
was conducted at the initial stage, intermediate stage (0.9 V), and
end stage (0.85 V) (Figure S13). At first,
the Eg, A1g, and B1g peaks34 at 467, 630, and 772 cm–1 were
clearly visible but slowly decreased as the conversion reaction proceeded.
This is due to the disappearance of the Sn–O bond, which is
direct evidence that SnO2 is transformed to metallic Sn
(the peak that is related to the surface defect),35,36 confirming that the phase transition is in agreement with in situ
TEM analysis. The results suggest that reliable in situ TEM observation
of electrode materials upon lithiation can be possible by using GLC,
as realistic electrolyte conditions can be viable in the GLC system.

Conclusions
In summary, we have realized the in situ TEM
observation of the
complete conversion reaction and agglomeration dynamics of NPs inside
liquid electrolyte. Sn NPs are nucleated from the surface of the SnO2 NPs and randomly move around to merge with other Sn NPs.
Coalescence is one of the main driving forces in a simultaneous manner
that results in the agglomeration and enlargement of Sn NPs. The coalescence
mechanism for Sn NPs is a stepwise process of (i) rotation to (200)
planes, (ii) formation of necks, and (iii) subsequent merging. Comparative
analyses of both in situ and ex situ TEM images and SAED patterns
suggest the new opportunities for fully utilizing GLC to observe complete
conversion dynamics and agglomeration dynamics of NPs in realistic
condition. This work will likely benefit the development of efficient
rechargeable batteries using metal oxide NPs with higher capacity
and cycling stability, as the fundamental insights regarding the phase
transitions and morphological evolution can be gained for not only
advanced metal oxide NPs (such as composite with metal oxide NPs,
metal/metal oxide alloy NPs, and metal oxide NPs coated with various
surficial layers) but also other high-capacity anode NPs (such as
Si and Ge) on the basis of in situ TEM observation, which lead to
optimized electrode designs for superior electrochemical performance.

Experimental
Section
Materials and GLC Preparation
SnO2 NPs were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (nanopowder <100 nm particle size).
The average diameters of the particles were 10–25 nm. The electrolyte
used in this study was 1.3 M LiPF6 dissolved in a solvent
mixture of EC/DEC (v/v = 3:7) with 10 wt % of fluoroethylene carbonate
(FEC). Before the preparation of GLC, 0.006 g of SnO2 NPs
were dispersed in 3 g of liquid electrolyte and the solution was sonicated
for 3 h. GLC was prepared by the following procedures. First, multilayer
graphene was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), using
a Cu foil (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) as the substrate. To remove impurities
and oxides on the surface, the Cu foil was etched with 20% phosphoric
acid (HF, 85%, Junsei) for 20 min. After placing the Cu foil in the
CVD chamber, the temperature was set to 1050 °C for 30 min and
stabilized for 60 min with 200 standard cubic centimeters per minute
(sccm) of H2 gas. Then, as the carbon source, 20 sccm of
CH4 gas was added for 25 min and the synthesis was ended
by cooling the chamber to room temperature, at a rapid rate. With
this procedure, 2–15 layers of multilayer graphene were synthesized.
It is reported that multilayer graphene can increase the yield of
liquid cells, while having little effect of resolution in TEM observation,
compared with monolayer graphene. Next, the synthesized multilayer
graphene was transferred to the holey carbon Au TEM grid (quantifoil,
300 mesh, hole size = 2 μm) by the direct transfer method.37 Using 0.2 M ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8, Sigma-Aldrich) solution
for 6 h, Cu foil was etched and no longer visible. The reason that
Au TEM grids were used is that during this etching step, Cu TEM grids
are likely be dissolved with Cu foil during the etching step. With
two graphene-transferred grids, the graphene liquid cell was prepared
by dropping 20 μL of electrolyte containing SnO2 NPs,
LiPF6, and EC/DEC (v/v = 3:7), with 10 wt % of FEC on one
graphene-transferred grid, and putting the other graphene-transferred
grid onto the top. Finally, the liquid drop was dried and encapsulated
by van der Waals forces between two graphene sheets.

TEM Analysis
A JEOL JEM-3010 TEM and charge coupled
device camera (SC200, Gatan) were used for in situ observation under
300 kV accelerating voltage. EDS elemental mapping was obtained using
JEOL JEM ARM200F under 200 kV accelerating voltage. EELS mapping and
spectrum were obtained by using GIF Quantum 966 in the Titan ETEM
G2 microscope at 80 and 300 kV condition, respectively.

Cell Assembly and Electrochemical Cell Testing
Ex situ
TEM images were taken on the electrode that was composed of SnO2 NPs, super P carbon black, and poly(acrylic acid)/sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose (50/50 wt %, Aldrich) binder at a weight ratio
of 80:10:10, as reported similarly in the previous works.18 They were mixed together with deionized water
and deposited on Cu current collector by slurry casting and dried
in a vacuum oven for 150 °C for 2 h. The loading amount of active
material was about 2 mg cm–2. It was assembled into
the 2032 coin-type half cells, which consisted of lithium metal as
a counter electrode, separator (Celgard 2325), and an electrolyte
consisting of 1.3 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (3/7 v/v) with 10 wt
% of FEC, which is an identical electrolyte used for GLC. It was cycled
at a current density of 50 mA g–1 between 0.01 and
3 V, using a battery testing device (WBCS4000, Wonatech). During the
discharge process, cycling was stopped at about 0.85 V and the electrode
was taken out from the half cell. It was washed with dimethyl carbonate
and dried for 10 min in the glovebox and analyzed with TEM.
