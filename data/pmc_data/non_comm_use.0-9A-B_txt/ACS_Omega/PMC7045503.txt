Vanillic
acid, an
oxidized form of vanilla, is a flavoring agent with a creamy odor.
Several studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of vanillic
acid, which are predominantly associated with anti-inflammatory and
antioxidative properties. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidative
properties may result from Akt or ERK signaling activation. The activation
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key downstream target
of Akt and ERK signaling, is a crucial therapeutic target for treating
depression. However, the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid remain
unknown. The present study applied the forced swim test (FST) to investigate
the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid and its association with
Akt, ERK, and mTOR signaling and upstream α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionaic
acid receptor (AMPAR) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice. Vanillic
acid demonstrated antidepressant effects by significantly reducing
behavioral despair in the FST. None of the treatments changed locomotor
activity. Additionally, vanillic acid increased AMPAR throughput,
Akt, and mTOR signaling but not ERK signaling in the PFC. NBQX (an
AMPAR blocker), MK 2206 (an Akt blocker), and rapamycin (an mTOR blocker)
used in pretreatment attenuated the antidepressant effects of vanillic
acid, but SL327 (an ERK inhibitor) did not. The immunochemical results
indicated that the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid depend
on the AMPAR–Akt–mTOR signaling transduction pathway.
Our findings reveal an Akt-dependent, but ERK-independent, the mechanism
underlying the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid, which may
be beneficial for some patients with depression.

==== Body
Introduction
Vanillic
acid with a creamy odor is an oxidized
form of vanillin and is benzoic acid. Although vanillic acid is used
as a flavoring and scenting agent in food,1 it also exhibits other properties and has been identified in a commonly
used Chinese medicine herb: Dong quai (Angelica sinensis). Dong quai has been used for thousands of years in treating menstrual
illness, cerebrovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive
impairments;2−5 recently, a beneficial effect of it against depression
has also been noted in preclinical studies.6−9 Meanwhile, studies
have reported that vanillic acid has neuroprotective effects in addition
to analgesic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory benefits against
nuclear factor-kappa B activation, proinflammatory cytokine production,
oxidative stress, and acetylcholinesterase.10−13 In addition,
the neuroprotective effect of vanillic acid has been suggested to
be mediated by Akt or ERK signaling activation.14,15

Recent studies have reported that the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine, muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor inhibitor scopolamine, the NMDAR co-agonists
sarcosine or d-serine have antidepressant properties;16−19 accordingly,
the stimulation of the Akt and ERK downstream mTOR signaling is a
notable target in the development of new antidepressants.20 Because vanillic acid has Akt and ERK signaling
activation characteristics,14,15 it has potential for
use in the treatment of depression. However, clinical or preclinical
studies about the effect of vanillic acid in depression treatment
are lacking. Also, the molecular mechanisms of the possible antidepressant
effects of vanillic acid remain unknown. To study the role of vanillic
acid in treating depression, the present study first evaluated the
antidepressant potential of vanillic acid by the forced swim test
(FST), which is the most widely used rodent behavioral model for assessing
the antidepressant-predictive effect.21,22 Several medications
with antidepressant effects can restore the behavioral despair in
the FST.21,23 Furthermore, we also hypothesized that the
antidepressant-like effect of vanillic acid is mediated by the activation
of mTOR via Akt or ERK signaling pathway. We investigated the association
of Akt, ERK, and mTOR signaling with the antidepressant effects properties
of vanillic acid by quantizing the levels of phosphorylation of mTOR,
Akt, and ERK in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice.

The effect
of NMDAR is closely associated with another glutamate ionotropic receptor,
namely, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionaic
acid receptor (AMPAR); increased AMPAR insertion is also required
for the antidepressant effects of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine and
the NMDAR co-agonist d-serine.17,19,24 In addition to mTOR signaling activation, AMPAR-GluA1
receptor insertion is also important for the antidepressant effects,
which may be a convergent mechanism of antidepressants.25 We also investigated the association of AMPAR
insertion in the PFC with the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid.

Results
and Discussion
Antidepressant Effects Following Vanillic
Acid Treatment
We examined the effects of vanillic acid using
the FST, an antidepressant-predictive
animal model; meanwhile, desipramine was also administered as a positive
control (Figure 1A).
The dose of vanillic acid was selected based on previous literature.26−31 Meanwhile,
considering the consistency and the need to minimize variations in
the drugs being administered, all drugs are by the intraperitoneal
route (ip). In the FST, vanillic acid and desipramine significantly
shortened the immobility period 1 h after the injection of three doses
(Figure 1B). The EPM test is used for evaluating the possibility of
a false-positive effect in the FST32,33 (Figure 1C). In the EPM test,
vanillic
acid and desipramine did not increase the number of entries into the
closed arms (Figure 1D) or distance traveled (Figure 1E). These results indicate that vanillic acid exerts
antidepressant-like effects.

Figure 1 Behavioral actions of
mice after three doses of saline, vanillic acid (100 mg/kg), or desipramine
(10 mg/kg, a tricyclic antidepressant as a positive control) intraperitoneally
injected in the forced swimming test (FST) and elevated plus-maze
test (EPM). (A) All the mice were intraperitoneally injected with
either normal saline (vehicle), vanillic acid 100 mg/kg, or desipramine
20 mg/kg (positive control group) three times 1 day, including at
1, 5, and 23 h before the forced swim test (FST). Twenty-four hours
before the formal test, mice were forced to swim for 15 min (pretest)
in a clear cylindrical tank with water. (B) Mice that received desipramine
and vanillic acid prior to FST exhibited a significant reduction in
the percentage of immobility time [F(2,27) = 14.334; p < 0.001]. (C) To evaluate the general locomotor activity,
mice were intraperitoneally administered with saline, vanillic acid
100 mg/kg, or desipramine 10 mg/kg in 3 injections. The elevated plus-maze
test (EPM) was conducted 1 h later. Immediately after EPM, four mice
were sacrificed and then rapidly decapitated. The prefrontal cortex
was removed for biochemical analysis later. The total closed arm entries
(D) and distance moved (E) in EPM were measured to determine if vanillic
acid could produce a general increase in general locomotor activity
that could yield a false-positive result on the FST. None increased
the locomotor activity [F(2,27) = 0.203; F(2,27) = 0.628; both p > 0.05; for
total closed arm entries and distance moved, respectively]. n = 10 per group; *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 compared with the saline-treated group with
the Tukey post-hoc analysis; values shown are mean ± SEM.

Involvement
of AMPAR and mTOR Signaling in the Antidepressant Effects of Vanillic
Acid
Using the AMPAR inhibitor NBQX and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin,
we studied the roles of AMPAR and mTOR signaling in the antidepressant
effects of vanillic acid. We conducted the FST to evaluate the behavior
of mice that were ip pretreated with the AMPAR inhibitor NBQX or mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin before the ip injection of vanillic acid (Figure 2A). As displayed
in Figure 2B, both
NBQX and rapamycin prevented the vanillic acid induced antidepressant
effects, indicating that they are dependent on AMPAR and mTOR activation.

Figure 2 Effect
of NBQX (10 mg/kg),
rapamycin (15 mg/kg), MK2206 (0 mg/kg), or SL327 (30 mg/kg) on the
antidepressant-like effect of vanillic acid in FST. (A, C) Timelines
represent the experimental procedure under the administration of drugs.
(B) Note that the decreased immobility resulted from vanillic acid
treatment is blocked when mice were pretreated with NBQX or rapamycin
[F(3,36) = 7.168; p = 0.01]. (D)
Similar effect is evidently observed when mice were pretreated with
MK2206; SL327 did not affect the effect of vanillic acid [F(3,36) = 10.802; p < 0.001]. n = 10 per group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared between
group with the Tukey post-hoc analysis; values shown are mean ±
SEM.

Involvement of Akt and
ERK Signaling
in the Antidepressant Effects of Vanillic Acid
Using the
Akt inhibitor MK2260 and ERK inhibitor SL327, we studied the roles
of Akt and ERK in the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid. We
ip pretreated the mice with MK2206 or SL327 before ip injection of
vanillic acid (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D, the anti-immobility effect of vanillic acid was prevented by treatment
of mice with MK2206 in the FST, indicating a dependence on Akt signaling.
By contrast, SL327 did not affect the antidepressant effects of vanillic
acid, indicating that the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid
are independent of ERK signaling.

Effect of Vanillic Acid
on mTOR Signaling Pathway Alteration and
AMPAR Throughput
To study whether the decreased immobility
in FST was accompanied by an increase in activated mTOR signaling,
we examined the activated forms of mTOR and mTOR upstream regulatory
proteins, namely, Akt and ERK, in the drug-treated mice. As illustrated
in Figure 3, injecting
vanillic acid at 100 mg/kg for three times significantly increased
the levels of pAkt (Figure 3B) and pmTOR (Figure 3D) but not of pERK (Figure 3C) in the PFC. Subsequently, we determined whether
vanillic acid functionally increased AMPAR throughput. We also found
an increase in pGluA1ser845 (Figure 3E) in the PFC of vanillic acid treated mice. By contrast,
desipramine did not affect these (Figure 3B–E). We did not observe changes in
the levels of total Akt, ERK, mTOR, or GluA1ser845 (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 Effect of three
doses of saline, vanillic acid (100 mg/kg), or desipramine (10 mg/kg)
intraperitoneally injected on the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, mTOR,
and GluA1ser845 in the PFC of mice. PFC samples were collected immediately
after EPM. (A) Western blot analysis of pAkt, pERK, pmTOR, and pGluA1ser845
was performed. The densitometry analyses of the blot (normalized to
β-actin) verify the enhanced activity of (B) pAkt, (D) pmTOR,
and (E) pGluA1ser845, but not (C) of pERK in each group of the experiments.
[pAkt, F(2,9) = 8.177, p < 0.01;
pERK, F(2,9) = 1.967, p > 0.05;
pmTOR, F(2,9) = 15.252, p = 0.01;
pGluA1ser845, F(2,9) = 5.585, p <
0.05, n = 4 per group; *p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01, comparison between group with the
Tukey post-hoc analysis]. Total levels of Akt, ERK, mTOR, and GluA1ser845
were not different among the three groups. Values shown are mean ±
SEM.

Role of Glutamatergic System
in Antidepressant Effects of Vanillic
Acid
To validate whether the antidepressant effects of vanillic
acid are mediated by the activity of the AMPAR/mTOR signaling pathway,
we studied pGluA1ser845, pmTOR, pERK, and pAkt activation by pretreating
the mice with NBQX or rapamycin before vanillic acid treatment. As
presented in Figure 4, NBQX administered before vanillic acid blocked the vanillic acid
induced increase in pAkt (Figure 4B), pmTOR (Figure 4D), and pGluA1ser845 (Figure 4E) immunoreactions. Moreover, rapamycin completely
abolished the increase in pmTOR immunoreactions engendered by vanillic
acid (Figure 4D) but
did not modulate the vanillic acid induced increases in pGluA1ser845
and pAkt expression (Figure 4B–E). These results confirm that the AMPAR–Akt–mTOR
pathway mediated the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid. In addition,
we did not observe changes in the levels of total Akt, ERK, mTOR,
or GluA1ser845 (Figure 4A).

Figure 4 Effect of NBQX
(10 mg/kg, ip) and rapamycin (15 mg/kg, ip) on the phosphorylation
of Akt, ERK, mTOR, and GluA1ser845 in the PFC of mice. PFC samples
of 4 native mice were collected 1 h after last injection. (A) Western
blot analysis of pAkt, pERK, pmTOR, and pGluA1ser845 was performed.
Results showed the significantly increased expressions of (B) pAkt,
(D) pmTOR, and (E) pGluA1ser845 in mice prefrontal cortex following
vanillic acid treatment, but the change of (C) pERK did not achieve
statically significant. Note that the increased expressions of (B)
pAkt, (D) pmTOR, and (E) pGluA1ser845 resulted from vanillic acid
treatment are blocked when mice were pretreated with NBQX. The increased
expression of (D) pmTOR resulted from vanillic acid treatment is blocked
when mice were pretreated with rapamycin and the increased expressions
of (B) pAkt and (E) pGluA1ser845 resulted from vanillic treatment
are not blocked. [pAkt, F(3,12) = 7.564, p < 0.01; pERK, F(3,12) = 2.399, p > 0.05; pmTOR, F(3,12) = 4.714, p < 0.05; pGluA1ser845, F(3,12) = 34.337, p < 0.001; n = 4 per group; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, comparison to saline + saline group with the
Tukey post-hoc analysis]. Total levels of Akt, ERK, mTOR, and GluA1ser845
were not different among the four groups. Values shown are mean ±
SEM.

This study demonstrated that vanillic
acid could produce
antidepressant effects, which were mediated by AMPAR–Akt–mTOR
signaling pathway activation. Another major finding of this study
is that vanillic acid could not activate ERK signaling; in addition,
the ERK inhibitor (SL327) did not block the antidepressant effects
of vanillic acid. Our results suggest that Akt signaling was involved
in the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid, but ERK signaling
is not necessary.

Recently, preclinical and clinical researches
have demonstrated that mTOR signaling plays a notable role in depression-related
disorders.34,35 Moreover, research has suggested
that rapid
mTOR signaling activation is the mechanism underlying the rapid-acting
antidepressant properties of ketamine and scopolamine.17,18 In addition to mTOR activation, the activation of the mTOR upstream
target ERK constitutes the mechanism for antidepressant properties
of ketamine; even a recent study found that the (R)-enantiomer of ketamine confers antidepressant effects by activating
ERK signaling and mTOR is not necessary for the antidepressant effects
of (R)-enantiomer of ketamine.36 Other studies have also demonstrated that ERK signaling
is involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders.37,38 ERK signaling activation has been implicated in antidepressant responses.36,39−41 Furthermore,
Akt, another upstream target of mTOR, has been found to be associated
with the pathogenesis of depression42,43 and involved
in antidepressant effects.44,45 In the present study,
we observed Akt signaling activation to be a mechanism associated
with the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid. Our findings are
consistent with those of previous in vivo research,14 which demonstrated that vanillic acid can activate Akt
signaling and confirmed the role of Akt in the antidepressant effects
of the drug.

Although we found that vanillic acid treatment
could induce ERK activation in the PFC, the results were not significant.
An in vitro study reported that vanillic acid administered at dosages
of 10–10–10–8 M could elicit
ERK activation in osteoblast-like UMR 106 cells.15 However, in another in vitro study, vanillic acid administered
at 4 mM was not involved in the effect of ERK phosphorylation on hepatocyte
growth factor-induced migration of human lung cancer cells.46 No previous in vivo study has explored the effect
of vanillic acid on ERK signaling. In this in vivo study, we found
that ERK signaling was not significantly affected by vanillic acid.
We also found that the ERK inhibitor SL327 did not alter the antidepressant
effects of vanillic acid. These findings suggest that ERK signaling
is not implicated in the antidepressant effects of vanillic acid.

In this study, the dose of vanillic acid was 100 mg/kg, which showed
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties, and beneficial role in
cerebrovascular insufficiency states in several animal models.26−31 We speculate
that the dose in the current study did not engender significant changes.
Additional detailed studies on the roles of Akt and ERK in the antidepressant
actions of vanillic acid are warranted.

Based on the findings
of Akt-dependent antidepressant effects of vanillic acid, to study
the future upstream and downstream Akt signaling events, we conducted
the FST to examine the behavior of mice treated with the AMPAR inhibitor
NBQX and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin after vanillic acid administration.
Both NBQX and rapamycin could prevent the vanillic acid exerted behavioral
responses in the FST, indicating the dependence on AMPAR and mTOR.
To define the corresponding mechanisms, we investigated the intensities
of phosphorylated proteins of Akt, ERK, mTOR, and AMPAR-GluA1 by pretreating
the mice with AMPAR-GluA1 inhibitor NBQX or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
after vanillic acid treatment. Our results indicate that AMPAR–Akt–mTOR
signal transduction activation is necessary for the antidepressant
effects of vanillic acid. The antidepressant effects of vanillic acid
on Akt signaling extend to upstream signaling AMPAR and downstream
signaling mTOR at that molecular level and are consistent with other
glutamate-based antidepressants.17,18,25

Based on the findings of ketamine with antidepressant
properties, glutamate neurotransmission modulation is a novel strategy
for treating depression. Several glutamatergic agents, including NMDAR
inhibitors, glycine site agents, and allosteric modulators, as well
as ketamine metabolites and stereoisomers exhibit antidepressant properties
with common mechanisms; such mechanisms include activated synthesis
of synaptic proteins, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
enhanced AMPAR-GluA1 receptor throughput, and, most notably, activated
mTOR.25 Notably, although the critical
roles of the mTOR signaling pathway in antidepressant behavioral responses
have been suggested for several glutamate-based antidepressants, including
ketamine, (S)-ketamine, (2R–6R)-hydroxynorketamine, and rapastinel, the roles of other
signaling pathways, regardless of mTOR activation, have been reported.
Yang et al. reported that ERK, not mTOR, activation plays a role in
(R)-ketamine’s antidepressant effects.36 In contrast to (R)-ketamine,
we found that vanillic acid exerts antidepressant effects through
Akt signaling and that ERK signaling is not necessary. These findings
reveal unique and differential effects of various antidepressants
on diverse signaling pathways, which can be responsible for their
distinct preclinical antidepressant profiles. The Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways regulate the activity of mTOR.47 Involvement in any component of these pathways
modulates mTOR activation, possibly leading to the development of
depression. Thus, vanillic acid may be a useful antidepressant for
depressed patients with particular involvement in Akt signaling but
not for patients with ERK-related depression.

Depressive disorders
are highly heterogeneous diseases with a complex relationship of biological
etiologies. There is no single convergent mechanism and there are
many risk factors potentially responsible for the development of depression,
which, in turn, results in individual differences in people’s
response to the same antidepressant. For example, a study demonstrated
that depressed patients carrying a Val/Val BDNF allele exhibited a
superior antidepressant response to ketamine compared with Met carriers,48 suggesting that these patients may have a different
endophenotype requiring an alternative pharmacological intervention.
One can reasonably assume that the precise targeting of these pathways
may be a critical therapeutic approach. Additional studies are still
required to elucidate the unique molecular mechanisms underlying the
effects of different antidepressants; the findings of such studies
will be crucial for the development of next-generation individualized
precision antidepressant pharmacotherapies to improve treatment efficacy.

Methods
Animals
C57BL/6 male mice weighing 15–20 g and
aged
6–8 weeks were housed in the Animal Center of China Medical
University under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at a temperature of
23 ± 1 °C, the humidity of 55 ± 5%; the mice had free
access to food and water. All experimental steps were reviewed and
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at China
Medical University, Taiwan (permit No. CMUIACUC-2017-318).

Drugs
All of the drugs were injected
ip at a dose of 0.01 mL/g body weight. The concentrations were as
follows: vanillic acid (Merck, St. Louis, MO), 100 mg/kg; desipramine
(Merck, St. Louis, MO), 10 mg/kg; NBQX (Tocris, Bristol, U.K.), 10
mg/kg; rapamycin (Toku-E, Bellingham, WA), 15 mg/kg; MK2206 (MedChemExpress,
Monmouth Junction NJ), 60 mg/kg; and SL327 (Merck, St. Louis, MO),
30 mg/kg. Vanillic acid and rapamycin were dissolved in 0.9% saline;
the remaining substances were dissolved in 5% ethanol.

Study Design
Using the FST, we examined
the antidepressant-like effects of vanillic acid. As illustrated in Figure 1A, 30 mice were randomly
separated into three groups: control group, comprising mice ip injected
with normal saline; experimental group, comprising mice ip injected
with vanillic acid (100 mg/kg);26−31 and positive control group, comprising mice
ip injected with desipramine (10 mg/kg)22 three times in 1 day, namely, at 1, 5, and 23 h before the FST.
The mice were forced to swim for 15 min (pretest) in a clear cylindrical
tank with water 24 h before the formal test. In addition, using the
EPM, we measured the general locomotor activity in mice for evaluating
the possibility of false-positive in the FST. Thirty additional mice
were randomly separated into three groups: mice ip injected with normal
saline; those ip injected with vanillic acid (100 mg/kg); and those
ip injected with desipramine (10 mg/kg) for three times in 1 day,
namely, at 1, 5, and 23 h before the EPM test. After the completion
of all behavioral tests, all of the mice were sacrificed, and the
tissues of four mice were collected for experimental analysis (Figure 1C).

The involvement
of AMPAR and mTOR signaling in the antidepressant effects of vanillic
acid was assessed using AMPAR inhibitor NBQX and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.
We conducted the FST to evaluate the behavior of mice that were ip
pretreated with the AMPAR inhibitor NBQX (10 mg/kg)49 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (15 mg/kg)50 for three times before ip injecting vanillic acid (100
mg/kg) for three times (Figure 2A).

The involvement of Akt and ERK in the antidepressant
effects of vanillic acid was assessed using the Akt inhibitor MK2260
and ERK inhibitor SL327. We ip pretreated the mice with MK2206 (60
mg/kg)51 or SL327 (30 mg/kg)50 for three times before ip injecting them with
vanillic acid (100 mg/kg) for three times (Figure 2C).

FST Model
The FST is a preclinical
behavioral test applied to evaluate the
antidepressant effects of medications. We conducted a 15 min pretest
and a 5 min formal FST according to a previously reported procedure.19 We use EthoVision Basic V3.1 program (Noldus,
Wageningen, Netherlands) to record and evaluate the total immobility
period during the 5 min testing period.

Elevated Plus-Maze Test
The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test
is a behavioral test used to analyze anxiolytic effects and general
locomotor activity in laboratory animals. The maze is an elevated
plus-shaped apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms. The total
number of closed arms entries (frequency) and distance traveled by
mice during the EPM test are quantitatively assessed as an indicator
of general activity to evaluate the possibility of false-positive
data in the FST.32,33 In this study, a mouse was placed
on the maze for a 5 min activity test. The test was recorded using
EthoVision Basic V 3.1 program for automated analysis.

Animal Tissue
Preparation
After the EPM
test, the mice were sacrificed, and the tissues of the PFCs of four
mice were collected and dried with nitrogen for Western blotting.
The collected tissues were preserved at −80 °C until grinding.
Before grinding, three centrifugal tubes were prepared for each sample:
one for grinding (rough grinding and precise grinding), one for the
supernatant, and one for testing. During grinding, 300 μL of
buffer was added in the centrifugal tubes containing the tissue. Subsequently,
we used a tissue grinder pestle for rough grinding and a tissue grinder
for precise grinding. After grinding, the tubes were centrifuged at
15 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was shifted
to another new cylinder tube after centrifugation and heated for 7
min before being preserved at −80 °C until Western blotting.

Western Blotting
Western blotting
was used to quantify specific protein levels. The analysis was performed
in accordance with the procedure described in a previous study.19

Statistical
Analysis
Each behavioral experimental group consisted of
10 mice. Each biochemical experimental group consisted of 4 mice.
Our results were presented as mean ± SEM. The assumption of normality
and homogeneity of variance, respectively, were evaluated by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test and Levene’s test. The behavioral experimental data showed
a parametric distribution. In addition, the expression of Western
blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were quantified as fold changes
in each band relative to saline-treated or saline + saline group.
The level of saline-treated or saline + saline group set at 100%.
The parameters of biochemical data were tested concerning normality
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and the data showed a parametric
distribution. Finally, mice behavioral and biochemical experimental
results were analyzed through a one-way analysis of variance, followed
by the Tukey post-hoc tests using SPSS 12.0 software. All of the statistical
tests were 2-tailed. A p value of less than 0.05
was regarded as statistically significant.

Conclusions
Our
study is the first to report that vanillic
acid would be a potential antidepressant whose effects are mediated
by AMPAR–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway activation. Furthermore,
these data reinforce the notion that Akt activation can be a relevant
therapeutic target for depression.
