This paper presents
a new route to one-step fabrication and in
situ application of hydrogen tungsten and molybdenum bronze (HxMO3) at room temperature and triggers
the interdisciplinary research of multifunctional materials between
liquid metal and transition-metal oxides (TMOs). Gallium-based liquid
metal (GBLM) enables the discoloration effect on TMOs in acid electrolytes
at ambient temperature. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon
can be ascribed to the redox effect at the interface of liquid metal
and TMOs in acid electrolytes. Both the theoretical calculations and
the experimental results demonstrate that the increasing intercalation
of H+ ions into the lattice of WO3 raises the
electron density at the Fermi level and charge carriers. H+ ion content in the obtained HxMO3 can be controlled in our approach to meet different requirements.
Taking advantage of the one-step fabrication and room-temperature
liquid phase nature of the liquid metal, HxMO3 is synthesized under ambient conditions in a very
short time, which is inaccessible with conventional solution-processed
mechanical alloying, or other methods. The HxMO3 obtained in this one-step approach enables convenient
and simple applications for biomimetic camouflage, cost-effective
energy storage, H+ ion sensor, and electronic switch.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal
oxides (TMOs), like WO3 and MoO3, have been
extensively studied because of their exceptional
electronic properties. Owing to the feature of their charge injection
and extraction, TMOs have great potential application prospect in
organic electronic devices and energy storage.1 Hydrogen bronzes (HBs) of nonstoichiometric materials are solid
conductive mixed oxides where mobile H+ ions are incorporated
into the crystal structure of TMOs.2,3 They are generally
in the formation of HxMO3,
where M is a transition metal such as element W or Mo. Thus, the hydrogen
tungsten bronzes (HTBs) and molybdenum bronzes are appearing as the
novel multifunctional materials with various particular properties
and widespread applications, including near-infrared light photocatalysis,4 solid oxide fuel cells,5 organic photovoltaics,6,7 energy storage,8,9 organic solar cells,10 electrochromic
and photochromic,11−13 and so forth.

HTB was initially reported by
passing suspensions of tungstic oxide
in hydrochloric acid through a specially constructed Jones reductor.14 With the diffusion of H+ ions into
WO3, blue color HxWO3 of HTB (x ranging from 0.1 to 0.6) emerged.15,16 Next, HTB was prepared via the reaction of Cu with monoclinic WO3 to form CuWO4, and then reduced in hydrogen flow,
producing HxWO3 and Cu.17 In addition, mechanochemical18 and mechanical alloying19,20 synthesis
routes have been successfully used for the HTB formation. More recently,
pore-arrayed HTB is fabricated with polystyrene as template by electrodeposition.21 A method for synthesizing low-temperature solution-processed
(in the presence of ethanol at 80–140 °C for 10 min on
a hotplate in air) was reported that the HxMoO3 layers are prepared on an ITO substrate.10 Both methods mentioned above are multistep and
need prepreparation. The present work not only paves a new way to
one-step fabrication and in situ applications of HxWO3 coatings at room temperature but also triggers
the interdisciplinary research of multifunctional materials between
liquid metal and TMOs.

Gallium-based liquid metals (GBLMs) are
ideal targets as reducing
agents because they are nontoxic, remain liquid at room temperature,
and present particular interface behaviors.22−27 It was reported that CO2 was reduced to carbon species
and copper oxide was reduced to copper phases on the surface of liquid
metal at room temperature.28,29 Moreover, a series
of findings on biomimetic chromatic liquid-metal soft robots was disclosed
recently.30,31 Lightened by the above research studies,
the discoloration effect of TMOs via liquid metal reduction was first
expounded in the present work. To enlighten this, here HBs samples
including HxWO3 and HxMoO3 were synthesized. HxMO3 can be stably formed at ambient temperature
because of the galvanic effect of liquid metal. In the public literature,
there is no report on the preparation of HTB by the reduction of liquid
metal. Therefore, we explored the discoloration process of HxMO3 in a liquid metal-hydrochloric acid
environment. We evaluated the absorbance of HxMO3 in visible and near-infrared light, and the
conductivity change with increasing H+ ion concentration.
Moreover, the underlying mechanism in enhanced conductivity was elucidated
combining experimental measurements as well as the first-principles
calculations. This approach is expected to open up a new world of
research studies in the important area of HB materials via the discoloration
process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Discoloration
Process of WO3
The discoloration process of the
WO3 coating on the
tungsten substrate was obtained via the contact of GBLM and the surface
of WO3 coating in HCl solutions (Movies S1–S4, Supporting Information), while the discoloration
phenomenon did not appear in the deionized (DI) water (Movie S5, Supporting Information). This contacting
process inspired the reaction where the H+ in acid solution
was injected into the lattice of WO3. The reaction speed
increased with the concentration of HCl solution and in turn discoloration
speed of the WO3 coatings was increased, implying that
the H+ ion injection in the lattice of WO3 had
a proportion relationship with the H+ ion concentration
of solution.32 As displayed in the discoloration
videos, a new route to produce HxWO3 in various colors was demonstrated, which would expand their
applications in biomimetic camouflage.

Figure 1a shows the variation in the color of the
WO3 coatings. Color of the slabs gradually changed from
pale green for pure WO3 coating to dusty blue for the treated
WO3 coating beginning at 0.5 mol L–1 HCl
solution, indicating that the W6+ ions or W5+ in WO3 may be reduced to a lower valence state of W atoms,33−35 synthesizing HxWO3.4 Because HxWO3 is deeply colored with an oscillator strength per W atom
of near unity. Namely, some adsorbed H+ ions from the HCl
solution entered into the lattice of WO3.36Figure 1b,c depicts that the thickness of the HxWO3 coating on the tungsten substrate is about 20 μm.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in Figure 1d verified the above hypothesis that the
semiconductivity of WO3 transformed into the metallic HxWO3.

conditions and the corresponding characterization data. (a) Photographs

analysis of the corresponding samples of (a). (e) Corresponding surface
resistivity of the corresponding samples of (a).

We also evaluated effective surface electronic resistivity
ρs of the obtained coatings (Figure 1e). Dynamic process of the surface electronic
resistance change is displayed (Movie S6, Supporting Information). ρs decreased with the
increasing H+ ions, representing that the doped H+ ions in the HxWO3 crystal
structure introduced greater electrical conductivity. Evidently, HxWO3 exhibits strong metallic features.
The mechanism lying behind this phenomenon can be ascribed to the
intercalation of H+ ions into the WO3 lattice,
which may give rise to shallow donor energy levels and charge carriers
are thus increased.15 Five samples in Figure 1e follow linear voltage–current
(U–I) relationship (constant slope k0) (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which reminds us of ideal resistors.

Figure 2a shows
the variation in the color of the powders and the related suspensions
in DI water. The discoloration process of the WO3 powders
can be observed in Movie S7 (Supporting
Information). With regard to the powders and its related intermixtures,
color changes from yellow for pure WO3 to light blue for
the treated WO3 powders in 0.1 mol L–1 HCl solution and dark blue in higher concentration of HCl solution.
WO3 powders (Figure S2, Supporting Information) and HxWO3 powders in Figure 2[a(iv)] (see Figure 2b) were consistent in morphology and average particle size, suggesting
that the discoloration process does not change the microstructure
in the nanometer scale. Optical properties of the WO3 and
the prepared HxWO3 were evaluated
by using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer in the range
of 200–800 nm (see Figure 2c). Optical absorption of the WO3 powders
is consistent with its indirect band gap absorption edge (2.53 eV).
Meanwhile, absorbance magnitude and absorbance position of four HxWO3 powders (ii to v) increase
significantly from a wavelength of 405 to 479 nm.

conditions and the corresponding characterization data. (a) Photographs

transmittance spectra of the related powder in (a). (d) XRD analysis
of the corresponding samples of (a).

As seen in Figure 2d, the H0.23WO3 appeared in the XRD
spectra.
Furthermore, the content of H+ ions in HxWO3 increased with the enhancing concentration of
H+ ions of solution. When the concentration of HCl solution
exceeds 1.0 mol L–1, the reaction product became
H0.53WO3. Compared to the WO3 coatings,
the small size of the WO3 powders increased the incorporation
content of H+ ions.36 The crystal
structure of the powders transformed from monoclinic to tetragonal
and cubic with the incorporation of H+ ions. The underlying
mechanism is that the injected H+ ions occupy the interstitial
positions in the distorted perovskite lattice and are surrounded by
nearly regular octahedrons of oxygen atoms with the latter displaced
by the normal perovskite positions along ⟨110⟩, thus,
the oxygen positions may differ slightly from the monoclinic WO3. H+ ions are significantly off center and are
attached to oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups.14

Besides the concentration of HCl solution, reaction time,
and temperature
are also vital parameters in the fabrication process. More verification
experiments and analysis were conducted in this study (Figure S3, Supporting Information). With the increasing
of preparation time and treated temperature, the product tetragonal
H0.23WO3 developed into the cubic H0.53WO3 when the preparation time, synthesized temperature,
and the concentration of HCl solution reached a certain value. The
interactions of the above three factors decided the final crystal
structure of HxWO3.

To
accurately analyze the HxWO3’s surface chemical composition, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed and focused on the
W 4f. WO3 powder features two peaks at 37.51 and 35.37
eV, related to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 core level
components, respectively, with an approximately 2.14 eV spin–orbit
splitting, which corresponds to a nearly stoichiometric (W6+) oxide composition (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 shows
the
evolution of the W 4f core level peak upon the WO3 coatings
in solutions with different concentrations of H+ ions of
solution. As shown in Figure 3a, W 4f core-level spectrum was fitted with three spin–orbit
doublets corresponding to the three different oxidation states of
W atoms. The peaks of W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 appear
at 37.95 and 35.81 eV, respectively, which can be attributed to the
W6+ oxidation state. The second doublets of lower energy
values at the peaks 34.41 and 36.54 eV arises owing to the emissions
from W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 core levels, respectively,
corresponding to W5+. Furthermore, two weak signals at
around 33.25 eV (W4+ 4f7/2) and 35.54 eV (W5+ 4f5/2) are obtained.37,38 The atomic ratio of W6+ to W5+ to W4+ was calculated to be 77.96:17.65:4.39, that is equal to W5.735+. Thus, the chemical formula can be written as H0.265WO3. Similar to the inference process for Figure 3a, the chemical formulas of substances from Figure 3b–d were defined
as H0.285WO3, H0.548WO3, and H0.594WO3, successively. These data show
that there is a strong concentration dependence of H+ ion
activity in WO3 and that the enthalpy of reaction is also
concentration dependent. The donor-state energy level is associated
with W atoms and its variation and broadening with increasing x values of HxWO3 are not yet fully elucidated. The H+ ions because of
its small size, exists at several equivalent noncentral positions.

2.2 Discoloration
Mechanism of WO3
GBLM features a self-limiting
thin oxide layer under ambient conditions
at the metal-air interface.30 On the basis
of thermodynamic considerations, gallium oxide existed as Ga2O3 on the surface of liquid metal, on which elements In
and Sn exhibited simple substance.26,30 An electrical
double layer formed on the droplet surface gives rise to surface reduction
properties.39−41 Hydrochloric acid solution was introduced to remove
Ga2O3 because of the reaction.42 The reaction between HCl solution and Ga2O3 can be defined as eq 1, that is 1  

As depicted in Figure 4a,b, determined by their material nature,
electrode potential of the liquid eGaInSn becomes more negative than
that of the WO3 with the increasing concentration of HCl
solution. Therefore, WO3 coatings or WO3 powders
in direct contact with the reducing liquid eGaInSn–acid interface
is reduced to HTB and the discoloration phenomenon is thus observed.
The redox reaction is described as eq 2. 2

Here, x represents the content of H+ ion in a HTB molecule.

2.3 First-Principles
Calculations and Simulations
To further elucidate the underlying
relationship between H+ concentration and sample conductivity,
the first-principles
calculations of the band structure and density of states (DOS) were
performed. Pure WO3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor
and the calculated band gap value is 1.32 eV (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

As depicted in Figure 5a,b, H+ ions fill into the positive hole of monoclinic WO3, which
acts as a conductive function. The crystal structure changes from
monoclinal to cubic with the increasing inserted H+ ions.
The fact that H+ ion insertion into WO3 and
diffusion throughout the lattice has low activation energy is because
of the favorable H-bonding interactions available during the entire
process, and the increasing intercalated H+ ions into WO3 increase electron density at the Fermi level and charge carriers.15Figure 5c–f display the electron DOS of HxWO3 (x = 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and
0.5). Clearly, when the H+ ions intercalate into the interstitial
site, a local energy level resulting from H+ emerges at
the Fermi level. With the improvement of H+ ion content
in HxWO3, the DOS at the Fermi
level gradually increases, corresponding to increased free electron
concentrations in HxWO3, which
is in accordance with experimental results.

HxWO3. (c) H0.125WO3. (d) H0.25WO3. (e) H0.375WO3. (f) H0.5WO3.

In addition, the synthesized HxMoO3 can also be color-controllable and stable in
acid conditions
(Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). MoO3 powders became dark with the H+ ion
doping, which presents similar trends to the WO3, and hydrogen
molybdenum bronzes were synthesized.10,43 This can provide
useful guidelines for the synthesis and application of hydrogen bronze
structure materials in the future.

3 Conclusions
The particular discoloration phenomenon of TMOs in acid electrolyte
can be ascribed to the redox effect at the interface of liquid metal/TMOs,
which realizes one-step synthesis of hydrogen bronze structures at
ambient. A new route to producing TMOs in a range of colors was inspired,
which can expand their applications in biomimetic camouflage. Taking
advantage of the one-step fabrication and room-temperature liquid
phase nature of liquid metal, the HBs were synthesized under ambient
conditions in a very short time, which is inaccessible with conventional
solution-processed, mechanical alloying or other methods.

Both
the theoretical calculations and the experimental results
demonstrated that the increasing intercalation of H+ ions
into the lattice of WO3 raises electron density at the
Fermi level and charge carriers. Importantly, the H+ ion
content of the obtained HxMO3 can be controlled in our approach for meeting different requirements.
The investigated one-step rapid-processed HxMO3 under ambient enables convenient and simple
applications for biomimetic camouflage, cost-effective energy storage,
H+ ion sensor, and electronic switch.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials Synthesis
The eutectic
GaInSn alloy (eGaInSn), gallium (67% weight, 99.99% purity) indium
(20.5% weight, 99.99% purity) and tin (12.5% weight, 99.99% purity),
which was prepared in a furnace (KSL-1200X) at 200 °C for 2 h.
The original WO3 and MoO3 powders were purchased
from Beijing DK Nano Technology Co., Ltd (average size: 50 nm). 1.0
g oxide powders (WO3 or MoO3) and 5.0 g liquid
eGaInSn were immersed in a centrifuge tube with 5.0 mL HCl solutions
in different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mol L–1, respectively). The above intermixtures were vibrated on a platform
vibrator for 1 min (IKA VORTEX GENIUS 3). HxMO3 powders were separated, centrifuged, and washed
by ethyl alcohol, dried in a furnace. WO3 coatings on the
surface of tungsten substrate in Figure 1ai were oxidized in O2 atmosphere
at 700 °C for 1 h.

4.2 Characterization
Synthesis and discoloration
process were captured with a Canon camera (EOS 80D). Morphology of
the HB powders and coatings were characterized using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan). XRD analysis was
performed on a Rigaku Smart Lab 9 kW XRD system. XPS spectra were
obtained using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system. The optical
properties of the synthesized powders were evaluated by using a Cary
7000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. The electrode potential
εSCE of liquid eGaInSn droplets (against a saturated
calomel electrode, SCE) was measured using a dropping method (Figure
S8, Supporting Information). Electrode
potential acquisition instrument (Agilent 34970A, Keysight Technologies
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was employed, which was connected to a
computer. Linear U–I curves were obtained
by Electrical Conductivity Measurement (HMS-3000).

4.3 Computational Methods
First-principles
calculations are performed using density functional theory methods.
Structural and elastic properties are calculated by using the plane-wave
pseudo-potential method,44 which is implemented
through the CASTEP code.45 The optimized
norm-conserving pseudopotentials46 are
used to simulate ion–electron interactions for all constituent
elements. A kinetic energy cutoff of 700 eV is chosen with Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes (6 × 6 × 6) spanning less than
0.04 Å–3 in the Brillouin zone.47 The cell parameters and the atomic positions
in the unit cell of monoclinic WO3 are fully relaxed. The
convergence threshold for SCF tolerance is set as 1.0 × 10–9 eV/atom. Optimized structure of WO3 (a = 7.413, b = 7.677 and c = 7.854 Å) is in good agreement with the experimental values
(a = 7.306, b = 7.54 and c = 7.692 Å). For HxWO3, a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell is adopted48 and HW8O24, H2W8O24, H3W8O24, H4W8O24 models are used to model HxWO3 with x equal to 0.125,
0.25, 0.375, and 0.5.
