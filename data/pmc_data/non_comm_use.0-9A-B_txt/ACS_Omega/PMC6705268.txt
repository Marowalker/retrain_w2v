Electrochemical
water splitting is the most energy-efficient technique
for producing hydrogen and oxygen, the two valuable gases. However,
it is limited by the slow kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution
reaction (OER), which can be improved using catalysts. Covalent organic
framework (COF)-derived porous carbon can serve as an excellent catalyst
support. Here, we report high electrocatalytic activity of two composites,
formed by supporting RuO2 on carbon derived from two COFs
with closely related structures. These composites catalyze oxygen
evolution from alkaline media with overpotentials as low as 210 and
217 mV at 10 mA/cm2, respectively. The Tafel slopes of
these catalysts (65 and 67 mV/dec) indicate fast kinetics compared
to commercial RuO2. The observed activity is the highest
among all RuO2-based heterogeneous OER catalysts—a
touted benchmark OER catalyst. The high catalytic activity arises
from the extremely small-sized (∼3–4 nm) RuO2 nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in a micro-mesoporous (BET
= 517 m2/g) COF-derived carbon. The porous graphenic carbon
favors mass transfer, while its N-rich framework anchors the catalytic
nanoparticles, making it highly stable and recyclable. Crucially,
the soft pyrolysis of the COF enables the formation of porous carbon
and simultaneous growth of small RuO2 particles without
aggregation.

1 Introduction
Covalent
organic framework (COF)-derived carbons can be highly
structured with substantial surface areas.1−9 This makes them good supports for the catalyst/electrocatalyst.7−9 The mesopores in the COF can accommodate active nanoparticles.10−15 Of the different approaches to developing COFs as supports for electrocatalytic
nanoparticles,16−21 utilizing them as a single-source precursor for generating nitrogen-functionalized
(pyridinic, pyrollic, etc.) porous carbons is quite effective. Such
carbons can have high surface areas,22 and
the N- and the C-centers in their framework can provide appropriate
binding sites for the catalytically active metal, and their inherent
micro-mesoporosity favor high active-site accessibility and mass transfer
via shortened diffusion paths. Most importantly, if the carbons can
be synthesized from the framework solids using mild conditions (T < 500 °C), they can be expected to have less microstructural
defects and potential high carbon-electrolyte interfacial energy.23−26 This makes them superior to typical amorphous carbons obtained from
high-temperature pyrolysis.27−29

Catalyzed electrochemical
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves
the release acceptance of the electron and proton.30,31 However, most catalysts display torpid kinetics, making water-splitting
less translatable in practice.30,32 Developing highly active
and durable OER catalysts can make the technology lucrative.30,33−41 Their performance is normally quantified by overpotential (η),
the extra voltage required over the thermodynamic potential (1.23
V) for the 4e-process. Most OER catalysts are oxide-based and require
>300 mV overpotential (η10) to deliver 10 mA/cm2 of geometrical current density.30,42−44 Only a countable number of them manifests <250
mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 (see Table S1).16,19,30,40,45−48 Precious metal oxides such as IrO2 and
RuO2 are known to catalyze OER effectively.30,49−51 Though precious metals can easily be ruled out as
an expensive choice for an OER catalyst, their superior performance
still makes them promising.52,53 For these to reach
realistic applications, their concentrations in the active catalyst
need to be kept low, the catalyst need to be recyclable, and the catalyst
support has to be cheap. Most importantly, if such expensive catalysts
can be made to run for long cycles, the cost may not be a huge factor
over extended operation periods. These advantageous features are the
hallmark of a heterogeneous catalyst. In many works, the OER catalysts
are benchmarked against Ru- and Ir-based ones.38,47−55 However, a scrutiny of the literature reveals that the touted Ru
containing heterogeneous catalysts using different carbonaceous and
metal foam supports have high overpotentials for OER particularly
under alkaline conditions (Table S1).54−58 This leaves a clear missing piece. What is the best performance
achievable from the heterogeneous Ru-based OER catalyst?

Our
study identifies a soft pyrolysis method that supports the
formation of two materials that require contrasting synthesis conditions.
Formation of RuO2 nanoparticles requires the use of surfactants
and annealing under oxidizing conditions. However, even 500 °C
is known to cause significant growth of RuO2 nanoparticles
(∼6 nm).59 Meanwhile, the synthesis
of graphenic carbon supports from various sources including COFs generally
requires temperatures >600 °C. Thus, identifying soft chemical
routes to synthesize these carbons under conditions that favor the
growth of small metal-derived nanoparticles can be of immense value.
Here, we have utilized the COF as a sacrificial reaction pot for the
growth of RuO2 under mild annealing temperatures (<400
°C). Our approach yields a homogeneous dispersion of RuO2 in ordered micro-mesoporous N-rich carbons derived from two
different N-rich COFs with related structures. RuO2 grow
as extremely small-sized nanoparticles (∼3–4 nm). The
RuO2@C composites catalyze OER with a η10 of only 210 and 217 mV in alkaline medium. The overpotentials observed
for these composites are very close to the recently reported high-performing
(191 and 200 mV) electrocatalysts,38 wherein
the elevated activity emerge only upon supporting the catalyst on
highly conducting nickel–gold foam as against the all-organic
carbon host presented here.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Structure of the IISERP-COF6
IISERP-COF1
(1) was prepared according to our earlier reported
procedure17 with slight modification to
the solvent combination. IISERP-COF6 (2), reported here for the first
time, was synthesized by reacting 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyltris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde
and hydrazine hydrate in a mixture of mesitylene, ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and ethanol (EtOH) in a sealed Pyrex tube
under solvothermal conditions (90 °C for 3 days) (Scheme S1).

We described the structure
of IISERP-COF1 (1) elsewhere.17 Similar
to 1, IISERP-COF6 (2) also has a 2D hexagonal honeycomb structure
(Figure 1A). The structures
of the COFs were solved employing crystal building simulations and
periodic DFT-based geometry optimizations using the Material Studio
program. The structure was geometry-optimized using tight binding
density functional theory (DFTB). In the optimized structure of 2,
the layers stack in an AAA···fashion, generating hexagonal-shaped
pores with a diameter of 26.0 Å along the ab-plane (Figures 1B and S1, not factoring the van der Waals radii). The
powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD) for 2 was refined in the P6/m space group using the Pawley routine,
which yielded an excellent fit. Refined cell parameters: a = b = 31.395(5); c = 3.386(7); Rp = 3.77%; wRp =
5.1% (Figure 1C). The
COF forms pure as confirmed from their PXRD patterns (Figure 1C). The COF retains its crystallinity
even after being exposed to basic conditions (1 M KOH, 12 h, Figure 1D). From 77 K N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, the Brauner–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 1290 and 1440 m2/g was estimated
for 1 and 2, respectively.17 A model-independent
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) fit to the desorption branch
yields pore sizes of 25 Å for 1 and 23 Å for 2. A ∼40%
drop in the porosity of 2 is observed when it is treated with KOH
(Figure 1E).

2.2 Synthesis and Characterizations
of the COF-Derived
Carbons
A family of composites was synthesized by heating
1/2 loaded with Ru(acac)3 at different temperatures (250,
280, 310, and 350/370 °C). At this elevated temperatures, Ru(acac)3 oxidizes, while the COFs undergo carbonization (Figure S3). The trapping of Ru(acac)3 in the nanopores of the COFs helps to grow truly small-sized (<5
nm) RuO2 nanoparticles in this capping agent-free method.
The soft pyrolysis restrains RuO2 from growing into larger
particles. We have used the COF, as they are known to pyrolyze to
high surface area carbons with accessible porosity.22 The best-performing catalysts were IISERP-COF1_RuO2@370 (Composite-I) and IISERP-COF6_RuO2@350 (Composite-II);
they are mostly discussed here (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Entire Process of
the Catalyst Preparation
From the PXRD patterns and the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
plots of the pyrolysis products, we find that the complete carbonization
of the RuO2-loaded COF occurred at 350–370 °C
(Figures S4–S7). The COF pyrolysis
was carried out in the absence of RuO2 to establish the
nature of the carbon that was produced. We noticed that the resulting
carbon was micro-mesoporous with high surface areas (BET = 517 m2/g; Langmuir: 840 m2/g; BJH pore size: 27 Å).
A DFT fit (C-spherical pore model) indicates the presence of hierarchical
pores. Notably, this was found to be graphenic carbon with a significantly
ordered structure as confirmed by PXRD and Raman (Figures S8 and S9). Formation of such graphenic carbon from
tartaric acid at these temperatures (<400 °C) is known,60 but we reproduced this by carrying out the pyrolysis
of tartaric acid at 370 °C and found that the resulting graphenic
carbon was nonporous (Figure S10). These
observations emphasize the importance of having to use the COF as
a single source precursor for generating porous graphenic carbons.

The fluffy needle-shaped morphology of the carbons was very similar
to those of the respective parent COFs as can be seen from the field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure 2). The elemental mapping confirms
the homogeneity of the Ru distribution in both the composites (Figures S11–S40). A comparison of the
adsorption isotherms of the composites prepared at different temperatures
reveals a systematic drop in the porosity with increasing temperature
(Figure 2).

of uniform micropores all along the surface of the COFs.

From the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM)
images, the majority of the RuO2 particles are in the size
limit of ∼2.5–4 nm (Figures 2 and S41). SAED
patterns of the composites reveal their poor long-range crystallinity
(Figures S42 and S43), yet there are crystalline
regions giving rise to lattice fringes. The indexing of the lattice
fringes from the HRTEM shows that the different crystal facets corresponding
to the [200], [101], and [110] reflections of the tetragonal RuO2 (ICDD: 00-040-1290) are exposed in the composites (Figure 2F,L). Some of these
facets are known to be highly active for OER.52,53,59

Interestingly, the Raman and infrared
spectra (IR) (Figures S44–S47) showed
that the many
of the functionalities of the COF were nearly intact in this soft
pyrolysis-generated carbon. The aforementioned fact corroborates well
with the large C/N ratio (neat COF = 3; RuO2@C = 4.25)
obtained from the elemental analysis. The Raman spectra show the characteristic
graphenic D and G band being present in this carbon (Figure S47). To verify the electronic conductivity of this
graphenic composite, we carried out four-probe measurements. The conductivity
of IISERP-COF1_RuO2@370 was 2 × 10–5 S/cm (Figure S48), which is quite moderate
compared to the traditional graphenic carbon (∼103 S/cm) synthesized
at high temperatures (>800 °C).61,62 This means
we do not get any major advantage of electronic modulation from this
COF-derived carbon support.19

The
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses on IISERP-COF1_RuO2@370 reveal the presence of characteristics peaks for RuO2 (Figure S67, Ru 3p1/2: 485.0 eV and Ru 3p3/2: 462.9 eV).63 In the C 1s spectra, the peak at 280.9 corresponds
to RuO2, and the peak at 282.5 eV is assignable to RuO3, occurring as a surface defect.64,65 The other higher binding energy peaks can be assigned to C 1s 285
and 287. N 1s spectra have two features of note. The peaks at 399.4
and 400.7 eV signify the presence of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen
in the carbon framework, and these are positively shifted, potentially
from weak Ru–N interactions.66 O
1s spectra show the presence of a peak at 532.2 eV which corresponds
to Ru–O bonds.63 This was consistent
with the 459 and 506 cm–1 bands observed in the
IR spectra (Figure S46), which is assigned
to the Ru–N and Ru–O stretching frequency.67,68

2.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements were carried out using a traditional three-electrode
setup using Hg/HgO and platinum flag as the reference, counter, and
catalyst-coated glassy carbon as a working electrode, respectively.
All potentials measured by using Hg/HgO were converted into the reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by calibrating Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH solution,
saturated with H2. The catalyst mass loading was maintained
to be 5 μg for all electrochemical studies. There was a sharp
rise in current after 1.4 V due to the oxygen evolution. The onset
potentials for composite-I and composite-II were 1.37 and 1.38 V,
respectively. The overpotentials (η) at a current density of
10 mA/cm2 calculated for composite-I and composite-II were
210 and 217 mV, respectively, (Figure 3A) which is to the best of our knowledge is the lowest
reported overpotential for a RuO2 catalyst till date.

curves showing the overpotentials for composites prepared
from IISERP-COF1 and IISERP-COF6. (B) Comparison of the Tafel slope
for composite-I and composite-II. (C) Nyquist plots showing the resistivity
for composite-I and composite-II. (D) Comparative LSV plots for composite-I
showing the systematic increase in activity with the increase in their
synthesis temperature. This is related to the controlled formation
of graphenic carbon.

The overpotentials to
achieve a current density of 50 mA/cm2 for composite-I
and composite-II were 274 and 269 mV, respectively,
which are quite remarkable. Not only the low overpotential but these
composites also deliver current density as high as 200 mA/cm2 at a potential of only 1.6 V which is highly desirable for faster
kinetics. From a plot of log I versus potential,
the Tafel slope (with 65% IR-compensation) was calculated for composite-I
and composite-II to be 65 and 67 mV/dec, respectively (Figure 3B), which indicates trouble-free
mass and charge transfer at the electrode and electrolyte contact
yielding fast kinetics for OER. Electrochemical impedance spectra
comparisons show that composite-I has less resistance than composite-II
(Figure 3C).

As composite-I has better performance as composite-II (Figure 3A,D), the electrochemical
stability studies were carried out with Composite-I. Highly reproducible
loops over continuous 500 CV cycle measurements at 50 mV/s in the
Faradaic region (1–1.4 V, Figure 4A) confirmed Composite-I’s cyclic
stability. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) profile indicates well-featured
redox peaks in the cathodic and anodic scans, corresponding to the
Ru(IV)–Ru(V) redox couple. The characteristic features of the
CV profile in the first cycle were completely intact even after 500
cycles. Also, there was some small contribution from the capacitive
current in the non-Faradaic region. To further establish the electrochemical
stability of the composite, chronoamperometry measurements were carried
out. A moderately stable current was generated over 12 h (Figure 4A). The Faradaic
efficiency of the composite was calculated from the rotating ring-disk
electrode experiment carried out by applying a series of current (Figure S68). Faradaic efficiency for composite-I
was evaluated to be 98% at 0.25 mA which further systematically reduces
to 25% at 2.65 mA disc current. This reduction in Faradaic efficiency
at higher current was due to the rapid release of oxygen at the disc
electrode, and all of which do not get collected on the ring, as some
escapes. The same is the cause for the drop in the activity during
the chronoamperometry, something we noticed consistently during multiple
measurements. In more detail, the decline could occur due to two possibilities,
either RuO2 leaches out from the COF or RuO2@C shows poor adhesion with the electrode. To test this, we carried
out the experiment with a larger electrode and with a larger sample,
and then, we collected the postcatalysis sample and measured the PXRD
which showed RuO2 being intact in the carbon (Figure 4). Thus, it appears
that the rapid evolution of oxygen witnessed by the vigorous bubbling
most likely weakens the adherence of RuO2@C with the electrode.
This disintegration of the catalyst from the electrode due to rapid
oxygen bubbling could represent a practical problem for all high activity
materials and this leaves sufficient room for the optimization of
the material/electrode preparation.

stability in the current

of overpotential for composite-I and composite-II with some of the
top performing OER catalyst. (D) FE-SEM, PXRD, and XPS characterizations
of the spent catalyst.

As another realistic
estimation of the catalyst efficiency, we
quantified the oxygen evolved during the OER. A systematic increase
of the oxygen amount from 0 to 248 mmol/h/g was observed (Figure 4B); this is higher
than the amounts reported for other COF nanoparticle-based OER catalysts.16,19,69 Cyclic stability was confirmed
by repeating the same experiment. Each time, before the measurement,
the cell was fully degassed for 1 h. Some drop in the oxygen amount
in the second cycle is due to the bubble formation at the electrode
surface. Despite this, the superior performance of the composites
compared to many top-performing OER catalysts can be seen from Figure 4C. Composite-I had
good structural integrity under these electrochemical conditions (1
M KOH, 1–1.6 V, 500 cycles), which was confirmed by PXRD, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and XPS studies (Figures 4D and S69–S71). Notably, the presence of Ru-3p peaks (Ru 3p1/2: 489.9 eV and Ru 3p3/2: 463.8 eV) in the spent
catalyst means, at the end of the redox cycles, RuO2 is
recovered.

The TOF for the OER was calculated to be 0.103 at
300 mV for composite-I.
This TOF is notably higher than the neat RuO2,50 RuO2@CNx,50 and Ir/C58 but is
lower than some of the Fe-based amorphous catalysts38,39,45 and the recently reported Ni3N-COF19-based catalyst (Figures S72, S73, and see Table S3). However, we do see
a more vigorous evolution in this case, which is explained by the
superior kinetics (Tafel slopes: 65 mV/decade for composite-I). The
observed kinetics is inferior only to Gelled FeCoW oxy-hydroxide38 and Fe(PO3)2/Ni2P.45 A comparison of the OER overpotentials for selected
high-performing materials with our composites at current densities
of 10 and 50 mA/cm2 is shown in Figure 4C and listed in Table S1. The superiority of the performance of this composite originates
not only from the small-sized RuO2 nanoparticles grown
at a precise temperature (Figures 2, 3D, S41, and S74–S78) but also from the high degree of crystallinity
evidenced from the lattice fringes arising from the stacked structure
of the graphitic sheets (Figure S8), quite
comparable to the recently reported COF-derived carbons.9

3 Conclusions
To summarize,
we have developed a heterogeneous RuO2-based OER catalyst
using the soft-pyrolysis method by employing
the COF as a sacrificial precursor in open air. This favors the growth
of small-sized RuO2 nanoparticles in the nanoconfinement
of porous graphenic carbon. This brings both energy benefits and opens
up the possibility of making superior catalysts via soft pyrolysis
of the COF. Considering that ruthenium compounds are the benchmark
catalysts for OER, the performance reported for this new RuO2 catalyst clearly raises the bar.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 4,4′,4″-((1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde
was synthesized according to the reported procedure.70

4.1.1 Synthesis of IISERP-COF1
This was
synthesized via reported procedure S2 with slight modification. In
a 20 ml pyrex tube, 0.112 g (0.25 mmol) of 4,4′,4″-((1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde
and 0.044 g (0.4 mmol)1,4-phenylenediamine were dissolved in a mixture
of 3 mL Mesitylene, 3 mL ODCB, and 5 mL EtOH. The mixture was then
stirred at room temperature for 60 min. During stirring, off-white
colored slurry was formed. About 0.3 mL of aqueous acetic acid (6
M) was added to this slurry, and contents were stirred for another
30 min. The tube was then purged with N2 and flash frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Then, the tube was sealed under a blanket of nitrogen
and heated to 120 °C for 3 days in a programmable oven. When
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, an off-white
colored fluffy powder was obtained, which was isolated by vacuum filtration.
The product was subjected to vigorous washing with dimethylformamide
(DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), acetone, and finally with plenty of
tetrahydrofuran (THF). It was dried in hot air oven before further
characterization. The yield was 76% with respect to the aldehyde.
Formula: C66N12O6H30;
molecular weight: 1087.04 g/mol. CHN values (calculated values within
bracket): C: 68.2 (72.92%); H: 4.18 (2.78%); N: 16.06 (15.46%). Note
that the COF utilizing these monomers are highly reproducible, and
many COFs are being reported by other groups using this trialdehyde
monomer since our first report of IISERP-COF1.17

4.1.2 Synthesis of IISERP-COF6
In a 20
mL pyrex tube, 4,4′,4″-((1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(oxy))tribenzaldehyde
0.112 g (0.25 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL mesitylene,
3 mL orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB), and 5 mL EtOH. Following this, hydrazine
hydrate (35%) 0.03 mL was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring
at room temperature. Contents were stirred for 60 min. During stirring,
off-white colored slurry was formed. About 0.25 mL of aqueous acetic
acid (6 M) was added to the mixture and stirred for another 30 min.
The tube was then purged with N2 and flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Then, the tube was sealed under a blanket of nitrogen and
heated to 90 °C for 3 days in a programmable oven. After the
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the product, an off-white
colored fluffy powder, was isolated by vacuum filtration. It was subjected
to vigorous washing with DMF, DMA, acetone, and finally with plenty
of THF. It was dried in a hot air oven before further characterization.
The yield was 78% with respect to the aldehyde. Formula: C48N12O6 H30; molecular weight: 870.842
g/mol. CHN values (calculated values within bracket): C: 66.61(66.20);
H: 3.87 (3.47); N: 20.29 (19.30). This is a cost-effective COF and
forms reproducibly in good yields and is quite crystalline. The discrepancies
in the calculated and observed CHN values most likely stem from the
guest solvent molecules in the pore and the presence of some unreacted
terminal aldehydes. These are consistent with the observations from
the TGA and the 13C-SSNMR.

4.1.3 Synthesis
of IISERP-COF1_RuO2@370
The synthesis of IISERP-COF1_RuO2 was carried
out in two steps. A solution of Ru(acac)3 (100 mg) in 10
mL of MeOH was slowly added to a sonicated suspension of IISERP-COF1
(250 mg) in 50 mL THF. After the inorganics addition, the mixture
turned to a bright pink color, and it was allowed to stir for 24 h
at room temperature. Following this, the suspension was allowed to
settle down, and the solid was recovered by centrifugation. This solid
was thoroughly washed with THF and MeOH [note that Ru(acac)3 is highly soluble in these solvents]. Thus, isolated pink-colored
solid, Ru(acac)3 loaded in COF, was heated at 370 °C for 3 h
under air. After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was
collected. CHN values: C: 74.64%; H: 1.61%; N: 8.84%.

4.1.4 Synthesis of IISERP-COF6_RuO2@350
The synthesis
of IISERP-COF6_RuO2 was carried
out in two steps. A solution of Ru(acac)3 (100 mg) in 10
mL of MeOH was slowly added to a suspension of IISERP-COF6 (250 mg)
in 50 mL THF. After this inorganics addition, the mixture turned from
a yellow suspension to a bright pink color. It was allowed to stir
for 24 h at room temperature. Following this, the suspension was allowed
to settle down, and the solid was recovered by centrifugation and
washed. The pink-colored solid, Ru(acac)3 loaded in COF
was the heated at 350 °C for 3 h under air. When cooled to room
temperature, a homogeneous black powder was obtained. This was washed
vigorously with water, methanol, and THF. No colored compounds were
seen in the postwash solutions. CHN values: C: 75.52%; H: 0.57%; N:
7.66%.

4.1.5 Synthesis of IISERP-COF1@370
To
verify the role of COF-derived carbon in the synthesis, IISERP-COF1
was pyrolyzed at 370 °C under air. The black powder was washed
with water, THF, and methanol. CHN values: C: 59.77%; H: 1.86%; N:
14.54%. Note that the presence of substantial quantities of nitrogen
in these carbons is generated from COF pyrolysis.

Note that
the optimal pyrolysis temperature for the preparation of a homogeneous
carbon-supported RuO2 catalyst was established from systematic
analysis using the PXRD and TGA (Figures S4–S7). The pyrolysis temperature was chosen based on the decomposition
temperatures of the COF.

Powder
XRD was carried out using a full-fledge Bruker Pxrd instrument. In
some cases, the data were recorded using a Rigaku Miniflex-600 instrument
and processed using PDXL software.

4.2.2 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Thermogravimetry
was carried out on the NETSZCH TGA–DSC system. The routine
TGAs were carried out under N2 gas flow (20 mL/min) (purge
+ protective), and samples were heated from 25 to 550 °C at 4
K/min.

4.2.3 IR Spectroscopy
IR spectra were
obtained using a Nicolet ID5-attenuated total reflectance IR spectrometer
operating at ambient temperature. The KBr pellets were used for IR
data collection.

4.3 Field Emission SEM
FESEM images were
collected using the Ultra Plus field emission scanning electron microscope
with the integral charge compensator and embedded EsB and AsB detectors.
Oxford X-max instruments 80 mm2. (Carl Zeiss NTS, Gmbh),
Imaging conditions: 2 kV, WD = 2 mm, 200 kX, Inlens detector. For
SEM images, as an initial preparation, the samples were ground thoroughly,
soaked in THF for 30 min, and were sonicated for 5 min. These well-dispersed
samples were drop-casted on a silicon wafer and dried under vacuum
for 12 h.

4.3.1 High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
(HRTEM)
The FEI (Jeol FEG 2100F is the model) high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) equipped with a field emission
source operating at 300 KeV was used.

4.3.2 Adsorption
Studies
All adsorption
studies were carried out using a 3-FLEX pore and surface area analyzer,
micromeritics and few cases “Autosorb IQ”, Quantachrome.

4.3.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS measurements were carried out using the Thermo K alpha + spectrometer
using microfocused and monochromated Al Kα radiation with an
energy of 1486.6 eV. The base pressure of the instrument was 1 ×
10–9 Torr. The pass energy for spectral acquisition
was kept at 50 eV for individual core levels. The electron flood gun
was utilized for providing charge compensation during data acquisition.
The peak fitting of the individual core levels was done using Origin
Pro software with a Shirley-type background.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical measurement was carried out using a Bio-Logic instrument
with techniques such as CV, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry.
Typically, a three-electrode test cell was fabricated using Hg/HgO
and platinum flag as the reference and counter electrode, respectively.
The catalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode was used as the working
electrode.

4.4.1 Preparation of Working Electrode
This was prepared by coating the catalyst on the carbon disk and
with subsequent drying under an IR lamp. The catalyst mass loading
was maintained to be 5 μg for all electrochemical studies.

4.4.2 Electrolyte
For all electrochemical
measurements, the degassed 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte. All
potentials were converted to RHE according to the following equation  

4.4.3 iR Correction
Excluding
the resistances arising from the electrolyte, reference
and counter electrodes are necessary. For this, iR compensation needs to be done on the LSV data. However, excluding
the electrolyte resistance completely from the system is not realistic.
This is due to internal resistance from the electrochemical system.
In this study, we have corrected the LSV data using 65% iR compensation. The Tafel plot is derived from the LSV data, which
is already iR compensated.

4.4.4 Evolved
Oxygen Quantification Setup
The testing was carried out in
an air-tight electrochemical cell.
A chronoamperometric study at 1.44 V (vs RHE) followed by quantification
of headspace gas by gas chromatography (GC) was carried out. This
measurement was carried out over an hour via injection of the headspace
gas at a 20 min time interval.
