Aripiprazole
(ARP), a quinolinone derivative, is an atypical antipsychotic
drug that is used in the treatment of schizophrenia. ARP has an extensive
distribution and more than 99% of the ARP and dehydro-ARP, the main
active metabolite, is bound to plasma proteins. However, information
regarding the protein binding of ARP is limited. In this study, we
report on a systematic study of the protein binding of ARP. The interaction
of ARP and structurally related compounds with human serum albumin
(HSA) was examined using equilibrium dialysis, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy, fluorescent probe displacement, and an X-ray crystallographic
analysis. The binding affinities (nK) for ARP and
its main metabolite, dehydro-ARP with HSA were found to be significantly
higher than other structurally related compounds. The results of equilibrium
dialysis experiments and CD spectral data indicated that the chloro-group
linked to the phenylpiperazine ring in the ARP molecule plays a major
role in the binding of these ligands to HSA. Furthermore, fluorescent
probe displacement results indicated that ARP appears to bind at the
site II pocket in subdomain III. A detailed CD spectral analysis suggests
that the chloro-group linked to the phenylpiperazine ring may control
the geometry of the ARP molecule when binding in the site II binding
pocket. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the ARP–HSA complex
revealed that the distance between the chlorine atom at the 3-positon
of dichlorophenyl-piperazine on ARP and the sulfur atom of Cys392
in HSA was 3.4–3.6 Å. A similar halogen bond interaction
has also been observed in the HSA structure complexed with diazepam,
which also contains a chloro-group. Thus, the mechanism responsible
for the binding of ARP to a protein elucidated here should be relevant
for assessing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ARP in
various clinical situations and for designing new drugs.

==== Body
Introduction
Aripiprazole (ARP),
7-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl)buthoxy)-3,4-dihydro-2-(1H)-quinolinone (Figure 1), is a novel antipsychotic agent with a different
pharmacological profile from other antipsychotics.1−3 ARP is a dopamine–serotonin
system stabilizer with potent partial agonist activity with respect
to dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, but with antagonist activity
for 5-HT2A receptors.1 ARP is metabolized
by two human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4,
to dehydro-ARP (Figure 1) being the main metabolite.4 Interestingly,
dehydro-ARP, the main metabolite of ARP, contributes to about 40%
of the ARP AUC in plasma.4 It is also known
that when used at therapeutic drug concentrations, more than 99% of
ARP and dehydro-ARP are bound to plasma proteins.4 Spectroscopic and molecular modeling studies have been
carried out to identify its binding site on human serum albumin (HSA),
the most abundant protein in human plasma.5,6 However,
in spite of the fact that ARP is widely used to treat various psychiatric
diseases, only limited information is available concerning the binding
of ARP to plasma proteins.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of ARP, its metabolite (dehydro-ARP),
and structurally
related compounds (deschloro-, 2-deschloro-, and 3-deschloro-ARP).

The direct measurement of the
concentration of a free drug can
provide meaningful information, provided a reference therapeutic range
for the free concentration has been established. In the case of drugs
that are highly bound to plasma proteins, the unbound fraction is
likely to show wide variations among patients, thus making them suitable
candidates for monitoring their free concentrations. In the present
study, we examined the protein binding of ARP. We initially determined
the binding parameters of ARP as well as its metabolites (dehydro-ARP)
and structurally related compounds (deschloro-, 2-deschloro- and 3-deschloro-ARP; Figure 1) to HSA, using an
equilibrium dialysis technique. The interactions of ARP, its metabolite,
and structurally related compounds to HSA were examined by CD. In
addition, the binding site involved in ARP binding was also identified
using site-specific fluorescent probe displacement. Finally, an X-ray
crystallographic analysis of an ARP–HSA complex was performed
to evaluate the binding mode at the molecular level.

Results
Determination
of the Binding Parameters of ARP, Its Metabolite,
and Structurally Related Compounds with HSA
The binding parameters
of ARP, its metabolite, and related compounds with HSA were determined
by an equilibrium dialysis technique. The number of high-affinity
binding sites and the respective binding affinity constant, n and K values, obtained by fitting experimental
binding data to the binding equation are summarized in Table 1. ARP and its metabolite, dehydro-ARP,
showed markedly greater binding affinities (nK),
compared with other compounds. In contrast, the nK values were substantially smaller for three other deschloro-ARP
derivatives (deschloro-, 2-deschloro- and 3-deschloro-ARP) that were
studied. In particular, deschloro-ARP had the smallest nK value. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that the position of the chlorine
group in the molecule had a significant effect on the nK values, as shown in the cases of 2-deschloro-ARP and 3-deschloro-ARP.
These results indicate that the chlorine group plays an important
role in the binding of ARP to albumin.

CD Spectroscopic
Study of the Interaction of ARP and Structurally
Related Compounds with HSA
The extrinsic CD spectra of the
ligands bound to HSA are shown at longer wavelength than 250 nm because
the influence of the intrinsic CD of HSA on the induced CD spectra
was relatively large. The induced CD spectra of ARP bound to HSA are
shown in Figure 2.
A positive Cotton effect was observed at around 265 nm, and a negative
Cotton effect was observed at around 300 nm. It should be noted that
the magnitude of these two peaks, with positive and negative signs,
increased with increasing ligand concentration. In addition, an isosbestic
point was observed at around 292 nm, suggesting that ARP formed a
1:1 complex with HSA. The sign and magnitude of the induced Cotton
effects for ARP-related compounds bound to HSA were different and
varied with their chemical structures. Contrary to the induced CD
for the ARP–HSA complex, a peak with a negative sign for deschloro-ARP
was observed at around 265 nm. The CD characteristics for 2-deschloro-ARP
were similar to those of ARP, where a positive Cotton effect at around
260 nm and a negative Cotton effect at around 295 nm were induced
by the binding to HSA. A small Cotton effect with a negative sign
was found for HSA with bound 3-deschloro-ARP (Figure 3).

Figure 2 CD spectra of ARP–HSA systems at pH 7.4
and 25 °C.
The concentration of HSA was 40 μM, and ARP concentrations were
5 (a), 10 (b), 20 (c), and 40 μM (d).

and 20 μM, respectively. (a–e) ARP-, dehydro-ARP-, deschloro-ARP-,
2-deschloro-ARP-, and 3-deschloro-ARP-HSA systems.

The effect of fatty acids on the induced CD of
the ARP–HSA
complexes was also investigated. Octanoic acid and myristic acid were
selected as typical examples of medium- and long-chain saturated fatty
acids, respectively. Octanoic acid caused a decrease in the induced
CD ellipticities of the ARP–HSA complex, as shown in Figure 4, suggesting that
octanoic acid may displace the ARP molecule that is bound to HSA.
However, myristic acid showed a different effect, with the positive
Cotton effect at around 265 nm was inverted to become a negative Cotton
effect. This observation can be attributed to allosteric conformational
changes in the HSA molecule that are induced upon the addition of
myristic acid.

of HSA, ligands, and fatty acids were 40, 20, and 120 μM, respectively.
(a,d) Spectra without fatty acid. ((b,e) and (c,f)) Spectra with octanoic
acid and myristic acid.

Solution pH (pH 6.5–9.0) had little effect on the
induced
ellipticities of the ARP–HSA complex, indicating that the involvement
of an N–B transition for the conformational change found here
can be excluded. It is also possible that the protonation state of
the ligand molecule was not critical for the change in the induced
CD spectra (data not shown). On the other hand, in the case of deschloro-ARP,
the enhancement in CD intensities in the presence of fatty acids was
observed.

Identification of ARP Binding Site on HSA
To identify
the binding site of ARP, we performed site-specific marker displacement
experiments using fluorescent probes, warfarin (a site I probe), and
dansylsarcosine (a site II probe), as reported by Sudlow et al.7,8 The addition of ARP caused a decrease in the fluorescence of dansylsarcosine,
whereas only a slight change was observed in the fluorescence of warfarin
(Figure 5). This result
suggests that ARP binds to site II on HSA. Although we did not examine
the binding of ARP to mutant HSA using equilibrium dialysis in this
study, Tyr411 appears to generally play an important role in ARP binding,
similar to most site II drugs. In fact, the induced CD spectrum for
the binding of ARP to Y411A was quite small, compared with that for
native HSA (Figure S1).

Figure 5 Effects of ARP on the
fluorescence of warfarin and dansylsarcosine
when bound to HSA. The concentration of HSA, warfarin, and dansylsarcosine
was 2 μM. Closed and open circles are the effects on the fluorescence
of warfarin and dansylsarcosine, respectively.

Crystal Structure of the ARP–HSA Complex
The
crystal structure of ARP–HSA complex was determined at a resolution
of 2.28 Å and refined to final R and Rfree factors of 20.7 and 25.5%, respectively.
This is the first crystal structure of ARP bound to a biomacromolecule.
Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized
in Table 2. A clear
electron density map for the ARP molecule in the crystal structure
of the ARP–HSA complex can be observed, in which one ARP molecule
is bound to subdomain IIIA of the HSA structure (Figure 6a,b). It is well known that
there are three ligand binding sites, referred to as drug site II,
FA sites 3 and 4 in subdomain IIIA of HSA.7,9,10 The ARP binding region appears to include
both drug site II and FA site 4 in subdomain IIIA of HSA (Figure 7a; stereo-view).
The interface area between HSA and ARP is 513 Å2,
as calculated by the PISA program.11 The binding region for the dichlorophenyl-piperazine group
of the ARP structure coincides with drug site II, which is surrounded
by Leu387, Ile388, Asn391, Cys392, Phe395, Phe403, Tyr411, Leu430,
Val433, Gly434, Cys438, Ala449, Leu453, Arg485, and Ser489 (Figure 7a,b). Furthermore,
the distance between the chlorine atom at the 3-positon of the dichlorophenyl-piperazine
group on ARP and the sulfur atom of Cys392 in the HSA molecule is
3.4–3.6 Å. This result suggests a halogen bond formation,
which is observed for the interaction between the sulfur atom of HSA
and the chlorine atom of diazepam12,13 (Figure 7b). The binding sites
of the dihydro-quinolin group and the butoxy linker of the ARP structure
coincide with FA site 4, which is surrounded by Tyr411, Lys414, Val415,
Val418, Leu423, Ser427, Leu430, Leu460, Phe488, and Leu491 (Figure 7a,c).

Discussion
Antidepressants
are one of the fastest growing classes of drugs
because of a variety of interrelated factors. Mental health issues,
including depression and mood disorders, have become far more frequent
in recent decades than in the past.15 The
rapid development of new antidepressants with minimal side effects
is a desirable effort. In fact, new generations of antidepressants
with improved side effect profiles, such as ARP, are becoming increasingly
available for the treatment of emotional disorders.4,15

ARP is rapidly absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability:
87%). This drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP 450
3A4 and 2D6 enzyme systems. The major metabolite, dehydro-ARP, is
pharmacologically active with an activity that is about 40% equivalent
to the parent drug. Although more than 99% of ARP and its major active
metabolite are bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic drug concentrations,
it is extensively distributed in the body.4 However, our understanding of the nature of the protein binding,
including the actual binding site remains controversial.

ARP
is sometimes co-administered with a variety of drugs in cases
where patients have two or more concurrent diseases. For example,
patients with hypertension normally will be given an angiotensin receptor
blocker and diuretics drugs are known to strongly bind to plasma proteins.
This led us to predict that drug–drug interactions of ARP might
involve the CYP enzyme system and/or binding to plasma proteins. The
focus of this study was on elucidating the protein-binding mechanism
of ARP, with the aim of precisely predicting the pharmacokinetics
and therapeutic effects of ARP. Equilibrium dialysis results indicated
that ARP preferentially binds to HSA, as expected from the results
of a previous report.4 The parameters for
the binding of ARP to HSA obtained here (n = 0.80, K = 7.51 × 106 M–1) indicated
that ARP forms a strong 1:1 complex with HSA. Pharmacokinetic data
also indicated that dehydro-ARP, the main metabolite, also has a high
affinity for binding to HSA. Compounds that are structurally related
to ARP have different binding affinities that appear to be related
to the presence and position of a chlorine group on the phenylpiperazine
part of the molecule. The high affinities of ARP and dehydro-ARP for
HSA that were obtained using equilibrium dialysis are in reasonable
agreement with the bound fraction (more than 99%) observed in human
plasma.4 Yan et al., using a fluorescence
quenching method, reported a much lower association constant for ARP
(K = 2.03 × 104 M–1 at 25 °C and 0.57 × 104 M–1 at 37 °C).5 Although the reason
for this discrepancy is not entirely clear at present, it appears
that the fluorescence quenching method may underestimate the affinity
of ARP for HSA.

That chlorine is important in the binding of
ARP to HSA was also
supported by a CD spectroscopic study. ARP and dehydro-ARP, both possess
two chlorine atoms on the phenylpiperazine moiety, and these groups
induce a relatively large positive Cotton effect at around 265 nm.
In contrast, deschloro-ARP induced a negative Cotton effect at around
265 nm. The CD spectral characteristics for 2-deschloro-ARP were similar
to those for ARP, in that a positive Cotton effect was found at around
260 nm and a negative Cotton effect was found at around 295 nm, which
were induced by binding to HSA. A small negative Cotton effect was
observed for 3-deschloro-ARP.

In ethanol, ARP shows a maximum
absorbance at around 255 nm based
on the tetrahydoquinolin ring and a shoulder peak around 295 nm due
to the dichlorophenyl-piperazine ring.16 The positive Cotton effect at around 265 nm can be explained by
the electronic transition of the tetrahydoquinolin moiety and the
small negative peak can be attributed to the electronic transition
of the dichlorophenyl-piperazine moiety. The positive Cotton effect
at around 265 nm may depend on π–π interactions
of the tetrahydoquinolin ring with Tyr411 and Phe488, amino acid residues
that contain an aromatic ring, based on the findings of the X-ray
crystallographic analysis (see Figure 7). In fact, the CD spectra of ARP bound to the single-mutant
Y411A was markedly different from that for the wild-type HSA (Figure S1). This spectral change can be attributed
to the change in the geometry of the ARP molecule through the weakening
of π–π interactions between ARP and HSA. Interestingly,
negative Cotton effects at around 260 nm were observed for deschloro-ARP
and 3-deschloro-ARP. These dramatic findings may be also explained
by conformational changes in ligand molecules within the binding pocket
through the disappearance of a halogen bond between a chlorine atom
of ARP and the sulfur atom of Cys392 in HSA. It is also possible that
a change in the dihedral angle of the C–N bond in the ARP molecule
accompanying the microenvironmental change may also affect the CD
spectra (different conformation from ARP molecule). The differences
in CD spectra observed here may reflect the molecular structures of
the ligands. In addition, extrinsic Cotton effects depend on the spatial
relationship between the asymmetric center and the perturbed chromophore
of the ligand as indicated in a previous report.17−19

The binding
affinity for 3-deschloro-ARP was found to be significantly
higher than that for 2-deschloro-ARP. The difference in CD spectral
characteristics between 2-deschloro-ARP and 3-deschloro-ARP can be
explained by differences in the geometry of the ligand within the
binding pocket in HSA. Equilibrium dialysis and CD spectral data indicate
that the chlorine atom of ARP plays an important role in the binding
of the molecule to HSA. This finding is further supported by the CD
spectroscopic study of the effects of fatty acids on the binding of
ARP to HSA.

To collect further information regarding ARP–HSA
binding,
the effects of fatty acids on the induced CD on the ARP–HSA
system were examined. Octanoic acid and myristic acid were used in
this study because it is known that they bind to HSA (i.e., the affinities,
binding sites, or effects on ligand binding and HSA conformation)9,20−24 and that these characteristics have been studied extensively. The
presence of octanoic acid decreased the induced CD ellipticities of
the ARP–HSA complex, suggesting the existence of a displacement
mechanism. On the other hand, the presence of myristic acid resulted
in the reversal of the sign of the Cotton effect for the ARP–HSA
complex. This observation can be due to allosteric conformational
changes in the HSA molecule induced by the binding of myristic acid.
In fact, no change in the free concentration of ARP was found upon
the addition of myristic acid under these experimental conditions
(Figure S2). Interestingly, the pattern
of induced CD spectra for deschloro-ARP was generally similar to that
of the ARP–HSA–myristic acid system. Therefore, the
reversed sign of the Cotton effects for ARP–HSA–myristic
acid system can most likely be explained by the geometry of ARP within
the binding pocket being reoriented following that of deschloro-ARP
through an allosteric conformational change of HSA that is induced
by the binding of myristic acid. Moreover, the increase of the observed
ellipticities of deschloro-ARP upon the myristic acid can be owing
to the enhanced rigidity of deschloro-ARP molecule accompanying microenvironmental
changes of site II binding pocket generated by myristic acid binding.

Myristic acid was found to have more than one high affinity binding
site and several low affinity binding sites on HSA.20 The fact that myristic acid did not increase the free concentration
of ARP (Figure S2) suggests that the high
affinity sites for ARP and myristic acid do not overlap.25 This hypothesis can be clarified by an X-ray
crystallographic analysis of the ARP–HSA–myristic acid
complex and is currently under way in our laboratory.

Fluorescent
probe experiments were carried out to identify the
binding site of ARP on the HSA molecule. It has been suggested that
ARP binds to site II in the HSA molecule. Indeed, equilibrium dialysis
data indicated that ARP forms a 1:1 complex with HSA and it competitively
inhibits the binding of diazepam (a site II ligand) but not warfarin
(a site I ligand) (Figure S3). Er et al.
classified ARP as a site II drug by monitoring the color change in
a fluorescence dye cocktail–HSA system after adding ARP.6 Meanwhile, Yan et al., using a spectral and molecular
modeling approach, proposed that ARP binds to site I.5 In spite of this discrepancy, our crystallographic data
for the ARP–HSA complex clearly indicated that ARP is located
in subdomain IIIA (site II). On the basis of crystallographic analysis
of the ARP–HSA complex, the binding interaction region of the
dichlorophenyl-piperazine group in the ARP structure is surrounded
by amino acids including Asn391, Cys392, Phe395, Tyr411, and Leu430.
It should be noted that the distance between the chlorine atom at
the 3-positon of the dichlorophenyl-piperazine group and the sulfur
atom of Cys392 in HSA is 3.4–3.6 Å. This observation further
supports the conclusion that the chloro-group in this molecule plays
an important role in the binding of ARP to HSA. The effect of such
a halogen bond has also been observed in the interaction between HSA
and diazepam, which also contains a chloro-group.12,13

Conclusion
In this study, the binding of ARP, a quinolinone
derivative and
an atypical antipsychotic drug, to HSA was extensively investigated.
ARP binds to subdomain IIIA (site II) of HSA with a high affinity.
As in the case of diazepam,12,26 Tyr411 is a key amino
acid that is involved in the high affinity binding of ARP. On the
other hand, the chlorine atom on the phenylpiperazine ring of ARP
plays an important role in the binding of ARP to HSA. It is known
that endogenous substances, including fatty acids and uremic toxins
as well as exogenous substances such as drugs also bind to site II.27 Therefore, it is highly possible for drug displacement
to occur under diseased conditions such as chronic renal failure.
Such a displacement on ARP which is 99% bound to plasma protein would
undoubtedly lead to clinically significant consequences. The findings
regarding the binding of ARP to plasma proteins obtained in this study
will allow further clarifications of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
of ARP in various clinical situations and will lead to the design
of new drugs.

Experimental Section
Materials
Recombinant
human albumin was a gift from
Nipro Co. (Shiga, Japan). Warfarin and dansylsarcosine were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Using a modification
of the procedure reported by Chen,28 albumin
was defatted with activated charcoal at 0 °C in an acidic solution,
deionized, and then freeze-dried. ARP was purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Dehydro-ARP, the main active metabolite
of ARP, was synthesized according to the method of Zeidan et al.29 2-Deschloro-ARP was purchased from Toronto Research
Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). 3-Deschloro-ARP was synthesized according
to the published procedure.30 Deschloro-ARP
was synthesized following a method reported by Banno et al.31 Octanoic acid and myristic acid were purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals
were purchased from commercial sources and were of the highest grade
available. About 67 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used in
the equilibrium dialysis and spectroscopic (CD and fluorescence) experiments.
Stock solutions of ARP, its derivatives, warfarin, and dansylsarcosine
(2.5 mM) were prepared in methanol.

Equilibrium Dialysis
Equilibrium dialysis experiments
were carried out using 2 mL Sanko plastic dialysis cells (Fukuoka,
Japan). The same volume of samples and buffer solutions (0.5 mL) were
inserted into the cell compartments which were separated by Visking
cellulose membranes and shaken gently at 25 °C for 12 h. After
equilibrium was achieved, ARP concentrations in the buffer (Cf; unbound drug concentration) and albumin compartments
(Cb+f; sum of bound and unbound drug concentrations)
were determined by HPLC. Bound concentration (Cb) was calculated by subtracting Cf from Cb+f. The experimental data were
fit to the following equation using GraphPad PRISM Version 4 (GraphPad
Software, Inc, CA, U.S.A.).  where r is the number
of
moles of drugs bound per mole protein. Pt is the protein concentration. K and n are the association constant and the number of binding sites.

CD measurements were carried out using
a Jasco model J-720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan), using a 10
mm cell at 25 °C. Induced ellipticity was defined as the ellipticity
(in degrees) after subtracting the ellipticity of HSA alone from that
of a drug–HSA mixture within the same wavelength region. No
induced ellipticities for fatty acid–HSA mixtures were observed
at wavelengths longer than 240 nm.

Fluorescent Probe Displacement
Warfarin and dansylsarcosine
were used as site-specific fluorescent probes for site I and site
II of HSA, respectively. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were
made on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Ibaragi). All measurements were performed at 25 °C using 5 nm
excitation and emission bandwidths. The excitation wavelengths for
warfarin and dansylsarcosine were 320 and 350 nm, respectively. The
probe–HSA ratio was maintained at 1:1. Fluorescence spectra
from the probe–HSA systems were monitored after the addition
of ARP, its metabolite and structurally related compounds as displacers.
The percentage of displacement of the probe was determined using the
following equation.  where F1 and F2 represent the fluorescence of
the probe plus
HSA without or with displacers, respectively. Although HSA concentrations
were maintained at low levels to minimize inner-filter effects, the
fluorescence intensities were further corrected according to the method
described by Lakowicz.32

Crystallization
of the ARP–HSA Complex
Preparation
of the HSA solution for crystallization was performed as described
previously.33 A stock solution of 50 mM
ARP for crystallization was prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The ARP–HSA complex was formed by mixing the HSA solution
and the ARP stock solution at a 1:5 HSA–ARP molar ratio in
50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 and 10% (v/v) DMSO, after which it
was incubated at 20 °C overnight. After incubation, the excess
unbound and insoluble ARP that was deposited was removed by centrifugation
(20 400g for 1 h at 20 °C), and the ARP–HSA
complex was washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 by performing
four cycles of dilution and concentration using a Vivaspin 500 (MWCO
10 000, Sartorius) centrifugal concentrator. The ARP–HSA complex
solution was finally concentrated to an HSA concentration of 1.4 mM.
Co-crystallization of the ARP–HSA complex was performed using
the hanging–drop vapor diffusion method, and the ARP–HSA
crystals for the X-ray analysis were obtained by multiple rounds of
streak-seeding with droplets prepared by mixing 2 μL of the
ARP–HSA complex solution and 2 μL of the reservoir solution
containing 32% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 50 mM potassium
phosphate pH 7.0 at 4 °C and pre-equilibrated for 1–3
days.

Data-Collection, Structure Determination and Refinement
The ARP–HSA complex crystals were directly frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Synchrotron experiments were performed at Photon Factory
BL-17A (Tsukuba, Japan). Diffraction data sets were collected at −173
°C using a Pilatus3 S 6M detector and the data sets were processed
and scaled using XDS.34 The initial phase of the ARP–HSA complex structure was determined
by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP(35) from the CCP4 program suite,36 with the coordinate (PDB: 5YOQ(37)) serving as the search model. Further model building was
performed with COOT.38 Structure refinements including the twin refinement with twin law
(l, −k, h) and the refinement of atomic displacement parameters by the translation,
liberation, and screw (TLS) method was performed with phenix.refine.39 Twin law and TLS groups were determined
by using phenix.xtriage and phenix.find_tls_groups from the PHENIX package,40 respectively. The stereochemical quality of the final structure
was evaluated by MolProbity.41 All molecular graphics were prepared using PyMOL.42 The atomic coordinates of the HSA–ARP
complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession
code 6A7P.
