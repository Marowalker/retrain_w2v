For hydrogel injection
applications, it is important to improve
the strength and biostability of the hydrogel as well as its injectability
to pass easily through the needle. Making gel microspheres is one
approach to achieve these improvements. Granulization of a bulk hydrogel
is a common procedure used to form microsized particles; however,
the nonuniform size and shape cause an uneven force during injection,
damaging the surrounding tissue and causing pain to the patients.
In this study, injectable hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hybrid hydrogel
microspheres were fabricated using a water-in-oil emulsion process.
The injectability was significantly enhanced because of the relatively
uniform size and spherical shape of the hydrogel formulates. In addition,
the biostability and mechanical strength were also increased owing
to the increased cross-linking density compared with that of conventionally
fabricated gel microparticles. This tendency was further improved
after in situ calcium phosphate precipitation. Our findings demonstrate
the great potential of HA-based hydrogel microspheres for various
clinical demands requiring injectable biomaterials.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biomaterials
have received particular attention for a wide range
of therapeutic applications, and many approaches have been introduced
to provide multifunctionality by evolving from pure to composite materials.1,2 Despite these advances, there is a disparity between fabricating
hybrid systems and applying them in compliant clinical treatments,
such as the practical use of injectable materials.3−5 Hydrogels have
been introduced to meet the demands for injectability because they
are easily malleable without cracking and maintain their tissue-like
elasticity because of their high hydration properties.6−8 The injectability of hydrogels allows them to fill three-dimensional
spaces in the tissue, thereby broadening their clinical applications
from cosmetic products to localized drug delivery and regenerative
cell therapies.4,9−12

To apply these developments
to practical injectable hydrogel applications,
granulization of a bulk hydrogel is a common procedure used to transform
the gel into microsized particles to meet the demands for injectability.13,14 The particulated assemblies are usually designed depending on the
location or depth of the tissue or the applications.15,16 In this case, the stiffness and size of the particulated hydrogels
critically affect the injection force when they are applied to tissue
in vivo.17 Hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels
are remarkable biocompatible and biodegradable polymers that are particularly
popular for injectable clinical applications.18−23 HA is a hydrophilic polysaccharide composed of d-glucuronic
acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, which is
found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulates biological functions
for cell proliferation and migration.24−26 Various chemical reactions
have been used to modify HA hydrogel to control their mechanical properties,
including their elasticity and degradation resistance.27 Moreover, by introducing biofunctional molecules
or reactive moieties to HA, hydrogels with multifunctionality such
as self-healing or shear-thinning properties can be obtained, which
provide ease of injectability, leading to their advance in biomedical
applications such as drug delivery and cell-based therapies.28−30 In addition, HA-based hybrid hydrogel particulates have been developed
by incorporating bioactive ceramic nanoparticles using a precipitation
process to enhance their structural stability under enzymatic degradation
as well as their bioactivity to promote collagen tissue growth.31,32 Although the injectable nanocomposite system exhibits excellent
biophysical properties, a high injection force resulting from the
presence of nanosized ceramic fillers and nonuniform shapes and sizes
of gel granules is unavoidable, thereby damaging the surrounding tissue
and causing pain to the patient.17 It is
difficult for large gel particles to penetrate smoothly through thin
needles, and small gel particles are attacked by enzymes because of
their large surface area, resulting in poor gel persistence.14,17,33 In some cases, uncross-linked
HA is mixed as a lubricant, which further reduces the strength and
persistence of the gel when the same volume of the filler is inserted.14,17,34 Therefore, it is necessary to
develop injectable gels with a uniform shape and a narrow size distribution
range to achieve both excellent injectability and biomechanical strength.

To address this challenge, in our work, HA-based hybrid hydrogel
microspheres prepared using a water-in-oil (w/o) method and an in
situ precipitation process are introduced. By applying phase separation
between the HA solutions and oil and using continuous stirring, uniformly
sized highly spherical hydrogel microparticles compared to conventional
crushed gels can be obtained. Furthermore, to improve their mechanical
strength and biophysical stabilities, in situ precipitation of nanosized
calcium phosphate (CaP) was applied to the HA microspheres. For further
evaluation, we compared our spherical hydrogel constructs, the pure
HA microspheres and HA-based hybrid microspheres, with conventionally
granulized gel particles. The shapes and morphologies were observed,
and their injectability and rheological properties were also evaluated.
Furthermore, the biostability of our microsphere systems was also
explored both in vitro and in vivo using enzyme solutions and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) after subcutaneous injection, respectively.
Remnant hydrogel formulations with a surrounding tissue were examined
using histological stainings to verify their biocompatible and biostable
properties. This comparative analysis is meaningful because there
are limited reports comparing gel microspheres prepared by the w/o
method with crushed gel particles, and the introduction of in situ
precipitation in their production is a novel approach.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of Gel Microspheres
and Crushed
Gels
The HA microspheres and HA crushed gels are referred
to as Sphere and Crush, respectively, and the CaP-precipitated hybrid
gels are referred to as Sphere-P and Crush-P, respectively.

The appearance of the gel was examined using optical microscopy (OM).
Sphere exhibited a completely spherical shape (Figure 1B) since HA solution is hydrophilic, while
olive oil is hydrophobic; therefore, HA droplets were formed in the
oil during rotation and were cross-linked. The size of the particles
was adjustable by varying the rotational speed of the HA and oil emulsion.
The diameter decreased from 896 ± 174 μm to 433 ±
124, 223 ± 69, and 97 ± 17 μm, as the rotational speed
was increased from 200 rpm to 400, 800, and 1500 rpm. In all cases,
the gel was formed into a perfectly spherical shape, and the particle
size showed a normal distribution (Figure S1).

Figure 1 (A) Schematic illustration of fabrication of HA microspheres and
crushed gel. (B) Optical images and (C) the size distribution of pure
gel microspheres and crushed gels as well as each gel with precipitation.

The particle size of Crush was much more varied
(Figure 1B). The gel
was physically
crushed by a homogenizer; however, it did not break into uniform shapes,
and small particles of several tens of micrometers and large particles
of several hundreds of micrometers coexisted. The average size of
the particles was depended on the rotational speed of the homogenizer;
however, its distribution was difficult to control. The gels had a
wide size distribution with high average size by a slow rotational
speed; however, the average size was excessively decreased with high
speed; 265 ± 190, 222 ± 172, and 77 ± 74 μm,
as the rotational speed was increased from 2000 rpm to 5000 and 8000
rpm (Figure S2).

Comparing Sphere
and Crush with similar averages, Crush had a much
wider distribution than that for Sphere; average diameters were 222
± 172 μm for Crush and 223 ± 69 μm for Sphere
(Figure 1C). The range
of the particle size distribution is important because it affects
the extrusion force required for the injection.14,33 Not only the spherical shape but also the narrow distribution of
Sphere makes this material more appropriate for injectable applications
than Crush. Crush-P and Sphere-P, in which CaP nanoparticles were
precipitated, were also examined, and their appearances were similar
to those of the pure Crush and Sphere samples, respectively (Figure 1B). The particle
sizes were 207 ± 146 and 211 ± 83 μm, respectively,
similar to the each pure gels (Figure 1C).

2.2 Characteristics of Gel
Microspheres
SEM images of the surfaces of the microspheres
are presented in Figure 2A. Both Sphere and
Sphere-P were spherical, without distortion after the precipitation.
At high magnification, Sphere exhibited a smooth surface, whereas
Sphere-P exhibited a nanoroughened surface because of the CaP precipitates.

Figure 2 (A)–(D)
Characteristics of pure gel microspheres and those
after precipitation. (A) SEM images, (B) FT-IR spectra, (C) XRD patterns,
and (D) TGA curves of pure and precipitated HA microspheres.

FT-IR spectra of all the gel groups and HA powder
are presented
in Figure 2B. The characteristic
peaks of HA appear at 1034, 1405, and 1607 cm–1.
These peaks correspond to C–O stretching, alkyl groups (−CH),
and carboxyl groups (−COOH), respectively. The broad peaks
near 2891 and 3279 cm–1 correspond to the alkyl
group (−CH) and hydroxyl group (−OH), respectively.35 These peaks were observed in the HA powder and
were also clearly visible for all four types of gel samples. Therefore,
the gel microspheres were formed well without residual oil or degradation
of HA. For the precipitated gels, a peak corresponding to PO43– appeared at 556 cm–1, indicating
the successful formation of CaP.36

The components of the precipitates were analyzed using XRD (Figure 2C). No peaks were
observed for the pure gel. Small and broad peaks were observed for
Sphere-P because the crystallinity of the precipitates was low, and
the nanosized precipitates coexisted between polymer chains. Peaks
appeared at approximately 26 and 32°, corresponding to CaP; thus,
the composition of the precipitates was expected to be CaP. To more
accurately confirm the composition, heat treatment was performed at
1250 °C for 30 min. The peaks were detached, and their compositions
were determined to be hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate.

The amounts of the precipitates were analyzed using TGA (Figure 2D). All the TGA curves
show similar tendencies. The initial weight loss was due to the evaporation
of water and solvent, and the weight decreased until 500 °C because
of the degradation of HA. After that, all the samples exhibited a
residual mass. For Crush and Sphere, residues such as sodium carbonate
remained at approximately 10%; however, Crush-P and Sphere-P exhibited
a residual mass of approximately 30%. Thus, the precipitate content
was approximately 20 wt % regardless of the type of gel.

2.3 Characterization of Cross-Linking Density
The 1H-NMR spectra used to characterize the cross-linking
density of Crush and Sphere are presented in Figure 3A. For both Crush and Sphere, peaks appeared
at 1.66 and 2.05 ppm, corresponding to protons of the alkyl groups
in the cross-linking agent, 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE)
and protons of the N-acetyl groups in HA, respectively
(Figure 3A,B). The
degree of cross-linking was determined by comparing the relative peak
integrals, and Crush and Sphere exhibited cross-linking densities
of 21.22 and 28.09%, respectively (Figure 3C). Thus, the cross-linking density of Sphere
was approximately 32% greater than that of Crush.

Figure 3 (A)–(D) Characterization
of cross-linking densities of gel
microspheres and crushed gels: (A) 1H-NMR spectra of crushed
gels and gel microspheres, (B) schematic images of cross-linking of
HA, (C) degree of cross-linking of both gels, and (D) swelling ratio
and water contents of the gels. The results are presented as the mean
± SD (n = 3).

The swelling ratio and water content of the gels were also examined
(Figure 3D). Prior
to comparison between Sphere and Crush, the analyses of the crushed
gels and uncrushed bulk gels showed no significant difference, which
means that the crushing process did not affect the wettability of
the gels (Table S1). The swelling ratio
of Sphere was 23%, which was lower than that of Crush (35%), indicating
that Sphere had a higher cross-linking density than Crush. Because
more cross-linking prevents the gel from absorbing much water, there
is an inverse relationship between the swelling ratio and cross-linking
density. In addition, the water contents of the precipitated gel were
96.24% for Crush-P and 94.99% for Sphere-P, representing reductions
of approximately 1% from those of the pure gels because the CaP precipitates
not only acted as a strengthening agent but also improved the bonding
of the polymer chains.

2.4 Mechanical Properties of
Gel Microspheres
and Crushed Gels
The viscoelastic behaviors of the spherical
and crushed gels were investigated using a rheometer, as shown in Figure 4A. The storage moduli
(G′) of all the samples were shown to be more dominant than
the loss moduli (G″) over the full range of angular frequency
(data not shown), indicating that highly elastic behaviors were achieved.
In addition, Sphere exhibited a much higher G′ than Crush over
the full range of frequency. For frequency sweeps, G′ at 6.3
rad/s was 735 Pa for Crush and more than doubled to 1764 Pa for Sphere
because of the enhanced cross-linking. Furthermore, Crush showed liquid-like
behavior where G′ varies with frequency, whereas Sphere exhibited
a more solid-like and stiff characteristic with constant G′
regardless of the frequency. The G′ values of the gels were
further increased by approximately 40% after precipitation to 1074
and 2381 Pa, respectively, and Crush-P exhibited predominantly elastic
behaviors. In strain sweep, Sphere also exhibited higher G′
than Crush over the entire strain range. Furthermore, the linear viscoelastic
region (LVR) was longer for precipitated gels, that is, the yield
point of deformation (the critical strain) was higher than pure gel
samples. This is because the CaP nanoparticles, which had formed homogeneously
between the HA chains, entangled the HA chains, and the gel becomes
ductile and can withstand large deformation. The complex viscosity
(η*), which means the total ability of a material to withstand
deformation, was calculated by considering the G′ and G″.
Although all specimens showed shear thinning, the η* appeared
in the same order as Sphere-P, Sphere, Crush-P, and Crush at all shear
rates (Figure S3).

and injectional properties of crushed
gels and gel microspheres and each gel with precipitation. (A) Rheological
behavior showing storage modulus for frequency sweep and (B) injectability
of each gel. (C) Relationship between injectability and storage modulus
graph of HA gels. The results are presented as the mean ± SD
(n = 3).

Thus, the stiffness was remarkably increased for Sphere, especially
after precipitation. In conclusion, the rheological properties of
Sphere were similar to those reported for HA dermis fillers, indicating
its appropriateness for injectable hydrogels in therapeutic applications.15,42,43 Furthermore, Sphere-P exhibited
improved properties and is thus suitable for the treatment of deep
wrinkles or severe skin deformities as well as the treatment of knee
joints with high load bearing.

2.5 Injectability
of Gel Microspheres and Crushed
Gels
The injectability was analyzed by measuring the injection
force (Figure 4B).
Crush required an injection force of approximately 20 N, whereas Sphere
was easily injected using an injection force of approximately 5 N,
demonstrating its improved injectability. For Crush, large particles
occasionally blocked the needles and increased the injection force.
However, Sphere passed through the needle without clogging because
of its relatively narrow size distribution and uniform spherical shape.

The effect of precipitate particles on the injection force was
also evaluated. For Crush-P, the gels became stiffened after precipitation,
resulting in an increased injection force. Sphere-P was also stiffened,
resulting in an increase of the injection force; however, it was still
released below 10 N without a rapid increase in force.

The relationship
between G′ and injection force is summarized
in Figure 4C. G′
was determined at a strain of 1% and a frequency of 6.3 rad/s, and
the injection force was averaged over a linear 2 mm section.44 Crush was prepared using various amounts of
BDDE, and there was an exponential relationship between G′
and the injection force. Also, the Sphere group was confirmed to exhibit
a low injection force and high G′. In general, HA particles
with higher G′ values are more difficult to inject, even if
the gel particles are very small because it is difficult to pass a
stiffened gel through a needle.17 However,
despite high G′, both Sphere and Sphere-P required significantly
lower injection forces due to their uniform size and shape compared
to crushed gels. Overall, compared with the conventional crushed products,
Sphere-P exhibited improved mechanical properties owing to the combination
of its high G′ and high injectability.

2.6 In Vitro
and In Vivo Degradation Behaviors
The biodegradability of
the gels was confirmed by analyzing the
degradation behavior both in vitro and in vivo. For an in vitro analysis,
in all the cases, the residual weight of the gel increased in the
early stage because the initial degradation loosened the polymer chains
and increased water absorption (Figure 5).45 After that, further
degradation occurred, and the mass decreased. After 24 h, the residual
weight of Crush remained at approximately 30%; however, that of Sphere
was almost 100%, indicating that Sphere was more stable than Crush.
The first explanation for this result is that the high cross-linking
reduced the swelling ratio and increased the enzymatic resistance
of the HA chain against hyaluronidase.46 Furthermore, Sphere is likely to be longer lasting because of its
relatively uniform size and small surface area, whereas Crush is a
mixture of large and small particles and has a large surface area,
which can be easily attacked by external enzymes. In addition, the
precipitated gels exhibited higher stability than the pure gels because
CaP particles acted as cross-linking agents between HA chains to enhanced
persistence. Therefore, Sphere-P was the most stable under in vitro
physiological conditions.

Figure 5 In vitro degradation behaviors of the gel by
hyaluronidase at 7
UI/mL. The results are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3).

Based on the demonstrated degradation
resistance properties, the
in vivo volumetric persistence of the Sphere groups under the skin
was also evaluated using MRI and compared with that of Crush. Figure 6A presents cross-sectional
images of the center of the injected gel as a function of time. The
white part corresponds to the residual gel and surrounding tissues
because MRI detects moisture. Sphere-P appeared to be maintained more,
followed by Sphere; however, Crush appeared to be more widespread
and less remained. After 8 weeks, Sphere-P became darker indicating
its water content was relatively low compared with that of the pure
gel. After 28 weeks, Sphere-P maintained a significantly high volume,
followed by Sphere, and Sphere was less diffused and more rounded
than Crush.

Figure 6 (A, B) In vivo degradation behaviors over time: (A) MRI images
of crushed gels, gel microspheres, and gel microspheres with precipitation
at 0, 8, 16, and 28 weeks after injection (scale bars: 1 mm). (B)
Remaining volume of each gel as a function of time until 28 weeks.
The results are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 5).

The entire volume was measured
by calculating the area of fillers
in 2D images and stacking them (Figure 6B). Crush showed a significant decrease compared with
Sphere groups at 1 week, and there was a significant difference between
the three groups after 8 weeks. When all three groups were expressed
as a spline-β line, the volume of residual gel was decreased
linearly; Crush and Sphere exhibited a sharp decrease between 4 and
8 weeks, and Sphere-P showed a rapid decrease between 16 and 20 weeks.
At 28 weeks, Sphere-P, Sphere, and Crush exhibited residual gel volumes
of 45, 36, and 23%, respectively. That is, in addition to the precipitation,
only pure Sphere had significantly improved stability and maintained
a round shape of the gel bundle better than pure Crush, which is consistent
with the previous evaluations.

2.7 In Vivo
Histological Observation
The histology was analyzed after
staining to evaluate the bioactivity
and tissue regeneration. In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining,
the blue color corresponds to the remaining gel, and the purple color
corresponds to the soft tissue (Figure 7A,B). The white part corresponds to the empty space
created by the partial removal of the gel during the process of dehydration
and paraffin treatment, which is a pretreatment process used for histological
staining. For Crush, the gel was fully depressed, whereas for Sphere,
an extensive fibrous tissue was observed between the gels (Figure 7A). Sphere retained
its original shape from an external force because the stiff gels exhibited
high resistance to deformation. Furthermore, spherical-shaped particles
are in point contact with other particles, while irregular-shaped
particles make surface contact with other particles, reducing the
volume of pores. Therefore, Sphere resulted in better volume restoration
than that of Crush. In addition, the tissue could infiltrate and regenerate
between the gels. This is beneficial in which the injected gel maintains
its volume well, the large contact area reduces foreign body reactions,
and the regenerated tissue maintains the space even after the degradation
of the gel. Furthermore, more regeneration was observed for Sphere-P,
and this difference was more apparent at high magnification (Figure 7B). It is difficult
to find any regenerated tissue or cells in Crush; however, regenerated
tissue with fibroblasts was formed between the gels in Sphere. In
addition, Sphere-P showed improved tissue regeneration with more fibroblasts,
the purple dots. Red dots (endothelium) are also observed in a rounded
collection, which indicates that the blood vessels were formed after
maturation of the new tissue. The fibroblast densities are presented
in Figure 7C, and Sphere
showed a significant increase compared with that of Crush. Also, Sphere-P
was further increased compared with that of the other two specimens.

gels, gel microspheres, and gel microspheres with precipitation after

images and (E) collagen area in ingrowth tissue. (F) Masson’s

are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3, **P < 0.01). (Scale bars for (A) = 1 mm, for (B) = 50 μm,
and for (C, D) = 120 μm).

The promotion of tissue formation for Sphere-P was affected by
two reasons. First, the adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts
are enhanced by the increase in stiffness of the hydrogel.47,48 Because stiffer gel maintains its shape well in the body and provides
a large space for cell attachment, fibroblasts attach well forming
the collagen and ECM for dermal tissue. Thereby, the proliferation
of fibroblasts and tissue regeneration were improved. Furthermore,
the CaP nanoparticles induced significant fibroblast cell migration
from the surrounding tissue and stimulated the biological response
for the generation of collagen and ECM production.49,50 The mechanism can be explained by the effect of calcium ions (Ca2+). The Ca2+ signal activated the biological function
of fibroblasts by enhancing the activation of SMAD, which is the main
signal transducers for receptors of the transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-β).51 It has been reported
that gene expression including SMAD2 and SMAD3 were higher in the
hyaluronic acid (HA) composites containing CaP than pure HA.52 Therefore, in Sphere-P, the released Ca2+ promoted expression of a TGF-containing growth factor through
a SMAD pathway, resulting in an increased fibroblast density and tissue
formation.

In addition, immunohistochemical staining with an
anti-CD68 antibody
was performed to confirm the immune response. Macrophages should be
stained brown; however, it was difficult to see macrophages in all
the groups, and there was no difference from normal tissues. For Sphere-P,
the many blue dots are indicating nonimmune cells, but the normal
cells were detected; thus, they can be regarded as fibroblasts. Quantitative
analysis revealed no difference in the expression of CD68 among the
three experimental groups (Figure S4).

Masson’s trichrome staining was also performed to confirm
the maturity of the tissue, as shown in Figure 7D,F. Collagen appears blue; therefore, a
higher blue ratio indicates a more matured fibrous tissue. Crush had
a little tissue and was reddish, whereas Sphere was partially blue,
and Sphere-P was mostly blue in an ingrowth tissue (Figure 7D). Sphere-P was more biocompatible
because of bioactive CaP and mechanical strengthening; therefore,
the fibroblasts could stretch for a robust collagen synthesis. There
was a significant difference in the area of collagen in the generated
tissue among the three groups, as observed in Figure 7E.

Biological responses on the dermis
were also examined. The dermal
thickness after filler injection was analyzed (Figure 7F). When the filler was inserted, the upper
dermis tissue was stretched and thinned. Using the bioactive filler,
the dermis was stimulated, and the dermal thickness approached the
original state. The thicknesses of Crush and Sphere were similar (approximately
100 μm), whereas that of Sphere-P was approximately 180 μm
(Figure 7G). The references
indicate that the dermal thickness of the nude mouse is approximately
200 μm;53 therefore, Sphere-P almost
recovered its original thickness. The CaP particles promoted cell
growth and tissue formation. In conclusion, we expect Sphere-P hydrogels,
which possess excellent biostability and biocompatibility, to be suitable
for injectable filler clinical applications.

3 Conclusions
In this study, HA microspheres were successfully
fabricated using
a w/o emulsion process and were compared with conventional crushed
gels cross-linked in bulk. The Sphere gels were fabricated with a
relatively uniform size and a completely spherical shape, and their
size was easily controllable by adjusting the rotational speed. Sphere
had enhanced cross-linking density compared with Crush, resulting
in a lower swelling ratio and improved mechanical properties. Furthermore,
the injectability was significantly increased due to the narrow size
distribution and spherical shape. The biostability was also improved
because of the higher cross-linking density and reduced surface area
resulting from the relatively uniform size. This tendency was further
improved after in situ CaP precipitation, which resulted in a significant
increase in strength and biostability with only a negligible increase
in the injection force. These effects were confirmed in in vivo tests.
Sphere was significantly more biostable than Crush, and the shape
of the filler was well retained. In addition, for Sphere, new tissues
grew by infiltration between the HA gels, and the area of collagen
in ingrowth tissues also increased. For Sphere-P, the CaP nanoparticles
stimulated cell growth and tissue formation, resulting in the formation
of more matured tissues and having a positive effect on the dermis.
Therefore, Sphere shows better potential for injectable hydrogel applications
than Crush in terms of the rheological properties, bioactivity, and
biostability, and these properties were further improved after CaP
precipitation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Biograde HA sodium salt
with a molecular weight of 1.8–2.5 MDa and a purity of 99.84
+ % produced by fermentation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus was purchased from SK Bioland, Cheonan, Korea. Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was obtained from Welgene, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea, and
zoletil was supplied from Virbac, Carros, France. Rompun was obtained
from Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany, and the anti-CD68 antibody was supplied
form Biorbyt, Cambridge, UK. All the other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA.

4.2 Fabrication of Gel Microspheres
The
HA microspheres were prepared using a w/o emulsion technique. First,
the HA powders were gently stirred in 0.2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
solution at 10 °C overnight to prepare a 10% (w/v) HA solution.
The cross-linking agent, BDDE, was mixed with the prepared HA solution
at 2% (v/v) and emulsified in olive oil at 10% (v/v). After 1 h, the
stirring speed was fixed at the desired levels, that is, 200, 400,
800, and 1500 rpm. The cross-linking was performed at 25 °C for
4 days with stirring because long-term cross-linking at low temperatures
(below 37 °C) has been identified to be more beneficial in enhancing
physical properties, than at conventional condition (around 37 °C
or higher).54

The cross-linked HA
microspheres were vacuum filtered using a Buchner funnel with a quantitative
filter paper (Advantec, CA, USA; pore 1 μm, thickness 0.22 mm)
to remove olive oil. The filter paper was placed on the Buchner funnel
above a triangular filtering flask, and a rotary pump was connected
to the flask to hold the vacuum. The washing solution was repeatedly
poured into the filter paper in a volume of 100 mL at a time. The
washing solution was initially 70% acetone aqueous solution, gradually
decreasing the concentration, and finally, distilled water (DW) and
PBS were used. After that, 2 g of microspheres were immersed in 10
mL of PBS for 2 h, and PBS was replaced every 30 min for complete
washing. Then, the microspheres were swollen in PBS at 37 °C
for 24 h. Swollen microspheres were separated from PBS using gravity
filtering and were used in the experiments.

To prepare the hybrid
microspheres, CaP nanoparticles were precipitated
inside the gel. After filtering and washing the residual oil, the
pure HA microspheres were immersed in 0.145 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 0.087 M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) solution for 2 h. They were then immersed in 10% (v/v) ammonium
hydroxide (NH4OH) solution for 30 min. The residue was
removed by washing with PBS, and the hybrid microspheres were fully
swollen in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h.

A schematic illustration
of the fabrication process of the gel
microspheres and crushed gels is presented in Figure 1A.

4.3 Fabrication of Crushed
Gels
The crushed
gels were fabricated by preparing a bulk HA gel and crushing it. After
mixing BDDE and 10% (w/v) HA solutions at 2% (v/v), 1 mL of each solution
was sealed in a polyethylene mold and cross-linked at 25 °C for
4 days. The cross-linked bulk gel was washed with PBS for 2 h to remove
residual BDDE and then swollen at 37 °C for 24 h. After the surface
of the swollen gel was wiped, it was crushed for 4 min at 2000, 5000,
and 8000 rpm using a homogenizer (T18 digital ULTRA-TURRAX, IKA, Staufen,
Germany).

For the hybrid crushed gels, the same process was
performed on the bulk hydrogel. CaP nanoparticles were precipitated
inside the gel. After washing, the bulk HA gel was immersed in 0.145
M CaCl2 and 0.087 M H3PO4 solutions
for 2 h and then in 10% (v/v) NH4OH solution for 30 min,
in sequence. The residue was removed by washing with PBS, and the
bulk hybrid gels were fully swollen in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h
and then crushed under the same conditions.

4.4 Characterization
of HA Gel Particles
The swollen gels were observed using
optical microscopy (OM; Dimis-M,
Siwon Optical Technology, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) after staining with
3% (w/v) alcian blue in 1% (v/v) acetic acid solution. The sizes of
all gels were analyzed using Image J program (National Institutes
of Health, MD, USA).

The gels were also characterized using
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Nicolet iS50, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000
cm–1 with an average of 32 scans after lyophilization.

The cross-linking density was determined using 1H-NMR
spectroscopy (AVANCE-500, Bruker, MA, USA). Crush and Sphere were
dissolved in deuterium oxide after treatment with 0.01 mg/mL (7 UI/mL)
hyaluronidase solution for 5 days and then dried.55,56 The cross-linking density was calculated by comparing the ratio
of the relative peak integrals of 2.05 ppm; the protons of the N-acetyl group in HA, to 1.66 ppm, the protons of the alkyl
group in BDDE.

4.5 Characterization of CaP
Nanoparticles in Sphere-P
The properties of CaP nanoparticles
were evaluated after drying
the gel particles at room temperature. The surface of Sphere-P was
characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM;
MERLIN Compact, Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) under an accelerating
voltage of 2 kV. The crystalline phases were characterized using X-ray
diffraction (XRD; D8-Advance, Bruker Co., Karlsruhe, Germany) over
the scanning range of 20–60°.

The CaP content was
quantified using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; simultaneous DTA/TGA
analyzer, TA Instruments, DE, USA). Before the analysis, the gels
were completely dried in air and heated to 1000 °C at a rate
of 10 °C/min under air condition.

4.6 Mechanical
Properties and Injectability
The rheological behaviors of
all the gels were analyzed using a
rheometer (Discover HR-2, TA Instruments, DE, USA) with a parallel-plate
geometry. All the swollen gels were prepared in a syringe in a volume
of 1 mL and dispensed onto the bottom plate, and then the top plate
with a 20 mm diameter was plated in a gap of 2.8 mm. Frequency sweep
tests were performed in the frequency range of 0.1–100 rad/s
at a strain of 0.1%. Strain sweep tests were performed over the strain
range of 0.01–100% at a frequency of 1 Hz.

The injection
force was measured using a universal testing machine (Instron 3343,
Instron, MA, USA) with a 50 N-capacity load cell. A 1 mL syringe was
filled with 0.8 mL of each gel, and a 27-gauge needle was inserted.
After that, a compression force was applied vertically at a crosshead
speed of 10 mm/min, and the force when the gel was released through
the needle was measured.

A plot of the storage modulus (G′)
as a function of the
injection force was obtained for various BDDE concentrations of the
crushed gels (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16% (v/v)).

4.7 Swelling
Ratio and Degradation Behavior
The swelling ratio was calculated
from the weights of the swollen
and dried gel. All the gels were swollen in PBS solution at 37 °C
for 24 h, and the swollen weight (ws)
was measured. They were then dried in a vacuum oven and weighed to
obtain the dried weight (wd). The swelling
ratio and water content of each gel were calculated using the following
equations:    

The degradation behavior was assessed
by measuring the weight of each gel over time in the hyaluronidase
solution. Each gel was immersed in hyaluronidase solution diluted
to 0.01 mg/mL (7 UI/mL) in PBS at 37 °C. The initial weight (wi) was measured at the beginning, and the remaining
weight (wr) was measured at each time
point. The remaining weight of each gel was calculated using the following
equation:  

4.8 In Vivo Assessment
Six-week-old female
BALB/c nude mice were obtained from a commercial vendor (Orient Bio
Inc., Seongnam, Korea). In total, seven mice were used (four for the
MRI analysis and three for the histological analysis), and three types
of injections were performed randomly for each mouse four times: (i)
Crush, (ii) Sphere, and (iii) Sphere-P (n = 5 per
group for MRI, and n = 3 per group for histology).
After feeding the mice a standard diet and allowing them to rest for
2 weeks, the mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection
of zoletil (30 mg/kg) and rompun (5 mg/kg). After the anesthetic was
administered, 200 μL of each gel was injected into the back
of each mouse between the panniculus adiposus layer and panniculus
carnosus, with a total of 4 injections per mouse (Figure S5). The in vivo animal experiment was approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National
University (IACUC protocol no. 18-0014).

4.9 Volumetric
and Histological Analyses
All the groups were examined using
the MRI volumetric analysis under
isoflurane/O2 (1.5% isoflurane, 1.0 L/min O2) immediately after the injection and after the first week and every
4 weeks up to 28 weeks. A magnetic resonance scanner (Agilent 9.4
T/160AS, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and a 1H surface coil (Millipede
Coil, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) were used for the MRI analysis.
Both T2-weighted axial and coronal images were obtained. The slice
thicknesses of the axial and coronal image were 0.3 and 1.0 mm, respectively.
The axial T2-weighted image was used for the volumetric analysis performed
using Image J program.

For histological observation, the injected
gels and surrounding tissue were extracted at 12 weeks. They were
immediately fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then gradually dehydrated
with ethanol and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were sectioned
into 4 μm thicknesses. The slices were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome to visualize the
remaining gel and infiltrated as well as the surrounding tissue. The
analyses of the collagen area and dermal thickness were performed
using Image J program.

4.10 Statistical Analysis
All the assays
were performed with a minimum of n = 3 per group.
All the quantitative variables are presented as means ± standard
deviations. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM, NY, USA), statistical software program.
For multiple comparisons between the groups, a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey’s post-hoc analysis were used.
The statistical significance was set at **p <
0.01.
