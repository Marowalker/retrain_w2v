1 Introduction
Catalysts
for one-pot cascade reactions have attracted great interest
in catalysis these years.1−10 Designed cascade reactions can simplify the synthetic route and
reduce the use of solvents and energy. The critical part of completing
these kinds of reactions is multifunctional catalysts, which contain
various catalytic active sites for different steps.11−16 Therefore, researchers make various attempts to develop catalysts
having both acidic and basic catalytic sites for heterogeneous catalytic
reactions.17−22

Various procedures have been developed to achieve an acid–base
bifunctional catalyst.23−27 For example, some researchers modify porous polymers28 or silica material29 with organic acidic and basic groups, such as amino, pyridyl, carboxyl,
or sulfonyl groups. The others combine inorganic compounds with opposite
acidity and alkalinity together.30 As a
derivation of the above two methods, organic acids or bases are also
matched to inorganic ones. However, most of these approaches need
to anchor catalytic sites to the substrate step by step. Sophisticated
and delicate operations are usually essential for the fabrication
of the catalyst to prevent the interference during the immobilization
of the acid and base. Therefore, it is necessary to find a new approach
to develop acid–base catalysts.

In cells, enzymes for
various chemical reactions are stored in
different organelles. Organelles are included in one capsule to complete
cascade reactions. This mode of operation makes cells similar to a
mini chemical plant. Each organelle plays the role of one unit operation
and does not disturb others. Inspired by the feature of cells, herein,
we report a novel and simple pathway to construct multifunctional
catalysts with acidic, basic, and magnetic properties at the same
time for the cascade reaction. The trifunctional catalyst is prepared
via the self-assembly of nanoparticles in microfluidic chips in a
modular fashion. The microfluidic chip is a powerful tool to produce
uniform microspheres with controllable diameters and components.31−38 Mesoporous silica particles with acidic and basic properties are
coassembled with magnetic nanosized Fe3O4. The
sodium alginate cross-links these nanoparticles in microdroplets.
Acidic and basic mesoporous materials take charge of catalyzing the
deacetalization–Knoevenagel reaction, which needs the acid–base
cocatalyst to synthesize a lot of useful fine organic chemicals. Meanwhile,
magnetic particles endow the catalyst the removable ability by an
external magnetic field. Each kind of particle is one module for building
the whole system of the catalyst. The particles perform their functions without interference,
like unit operations in chemical plants or organelles in cells. The
synthetic process of the catalyst is facile and does not use any volatile
solvent. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity and selectivity
and are easily reused several times by being recovered with the magnet.

2 Results and Discussion
Both acidic and basic catalytic
components were prepared using
an impregnation calcination method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of silica materials are shown in Figure 1. The prepared silica material has a significant
diffraction peak at 2.18°, which is unique to the mesoporous
structure, indicating that the pores of the material are nanosized.

Figure 1 (a) Low-angle
and (b) high-angle XRD patterns of mesoporous silica
materials.

After loading zirconium, the position
of the diffraction peak shifts
to a low angle and the diffraction intensity decreases, but the decrease
is not significant. This means that a load of zirconia caused a decrease
in pore size and that its mesoporous structure was well maintained.
However, after loading magnesium oxide, the diffraction peak shifts
to a high angle and the diffraction intensity decreases, which means
that the internal pore diameter of the particles increases and the
degree of mesoporous structure decreases. This may be because magnesium
oxide is more basic and reacts with silica at high temperature, causing
the pores to be partially destroyed. However, significant diffraction
peaks can be observed at low diffraction angles, indicating that the
mesoporous structure still exists in MgO–SiO2. Only
the disordered structure diffraction peaks can be observed at high
angles (Figure 1b),
without respective characteristic diffraction peaks of the metal oxides.
This indicates that in the two types of composites the metal oxides
are low in the content and not in the form of a crystal.

Scanning
electron microscopic (SEM) images (Figure 2) also show that the mesoporous particles
did not significantly change their spherical morphology before and
after loading metal oxides. At the same time, free-existing oxide
powders were not observed between the particles, indicating that the
oxides mainly existed in the pores, which is also consistent with
the results observed by XRD. A heterogeneous catalysis process often
requires catalysts with large specific surface areas and better pore
structures to provide more catalytic sites and facilitate molecular
diffusion.

mesoporous silica (ZrO2–SiO2), and (c)
magnesium oxide-modified mesoporous silica (MgO–SiO2).

As shown in Figure 3, mesoporous silica has a diameter of about
400 nm and the ordered
pore structure runs through the entire microsphere (Figure S1). Furthermore, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) mapping (Figure 3d,h) shows that zirconium and magnesium are distributed on the mesoporous
silica microspheres uniformly. Argon isothermal adsorption was used
to determine the change in pore parameters of the mesoporous materials
before and after loading the metal oxides.

X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of mesoporous silica materials. (a,
e) High-angle annular dark-field images of mesoporous silica and distribution
of O (b, f), Si (e, g), Zr (d), and Mg (h).

As shown in Figure 4 and Table S2, the specific surface
area
and pore volume of all mesoporous-material-supported metal oxides decreased, but they still
maintained a specific surface area of 200–1000 m2 g–1. This is larger than the surface area of many
porous materials. The pore diameter and pore volume of ZrO2–SiO2 are slightly reduced, which are 2.96 nm and
0.54 cm3 g–1, respectively. This is due
to the deposition of zirconia in the pores. The pore volume of MgO–SiO2 decreased by 65%. However, the pore diameter of MgO–SiO2 increased slightly, reaching 3.19 nm. This may be due to
the strong basicity of MgO that reacts with SiO2 to cause
the pores to be partially etched. The above results are consistent
with the results of XRD observations. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
(Table S1) results show that mass fractions
of Zr and Mg in ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 are 1.64 and 4.37%, respectively. The results indicated that
SiO2 is the central oxide as a carrier after compounding
with other metal oxides.

of the mesoporous
silica materials and the multimodule microspheres and (b) pore size
distribution of the mesoporous silica materials and the multimodule
microspheres.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to explore the
valencies and types of the elements in the mesoporous catalysts. According
to Figure 5, the binding energy of the 1s peak
of Mg is 1305 eV and the binding energies of 3d peaks of Zr are 183
and 186 eV, which indicated that both zirconium oxide and magnesium
oxide could be loaded onto the silicon oxide surface by the impregnation
process. According to Table S3, the O 1s
electron binding energy in MgO–SiO2 is lower than
that in ZrO2–SiO2 and SiO2, which means that the alkalinity of the oxygen anion is enhanced.
Magnesium oxide is an alkaline-earth-metal oxide and an ideal solid
base so that the composite exhibits alkalinity predominantly after
being loaded onto silica. According to the report of Noller et al.,39 the basic strength of MgO–SiO2 is between that of SiO2 and MgO; XPS results further
validate the above inference.

(b) Si 2s spectra
of mesoporous silica materials, (c) Zr 3d spectra of ZrO2–SiO2, and (d) Mg 1s spectra of MgO–SiO2.

Chemisorption determines the acid–base
amount of the composite
oxide. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of
NH3 (Figure 6a) show that after loading metal oxides the acid site amounts in ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 are more than those in pure
mesoporous silica, which are 1.50 and 1.26 mmol g–1, respectively. According to Tanabe’s rule regarding the acidity
of the metal complex oxide,40 the number
of acid sites of ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 should be more than that of SiO2. The chemisorption
results in Figure 6a and Table 1 well
fit this rule. The TPD experiments of CO2 (Figure 6b) show that the most basic
adsorption site is in MgO–SiO2, consistent with
the strong alkaline property of MgO. The pyridine in situ infrared
adsorption spectra are further used to study the type of acids in
different mesoporous silica materials.

patterns and (b) CO2-TPD patterns
of mesoporous silica materials, (c) Py-IR spectra of mesoporous silica
materials, and (d) type of acid when pyridine is bonded to different
atoms (M: metal atom; H: hydrogen atom).

Silica Materials

amount (mmol g–1)	
SiO2	0.86	0.51	
ZrO2–SiO2	1.50	10.02	
MgO–SiO2	1.26	49.67	
As shown in Figure 6c, the peaks at 1446
and 1608 cm–1 indicate the
adsorption of pyridine on the Lewis acid sites. The peak at 1546 cm–1 is ascribed to the Brønsted acid sites. The
band at 1490 cm–1 is assigned to the simultaneous
adsorption of pyridine on both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites.
The peak area is directly proportional to the number of acid sites.
The figure shows that ZrO2–SiO2 contains
numerous Lewis acid sites and a few Brønsted acid sites. However,
there is almost no Brønsted acid site in MgO–SiO2 and SiO2. This indicates that the acidity of the surface
hydroxyl groups of MgO–SiO2 and SiO2 is
not strong enough to convert pyridine into pyridine cation (Figure 6d). ZrO2–SiO2 porous materials have the most acidic sites
in these three materials, which is in accordance with the results
of the chemisorption.

Both catalytic units can be assembled
into bifunctional catalytic
microspheres in microfluidic chips. An aqueous solution containing
ZrO2–SiO2, MgO–SiO2, and sodium alginate was used as the dispersed phase, whereas liquid
paraffin containing calcium chloride was used as the continuous phase.
The microfluidic chip is constructed by combining a capillary with
a cone and a three-dimensional (3D) printing part with a square channel
(Figure S2). Compared with the conventional
capillary flow focusing a microfluidic chip or 3D printing chip, this
structure solves two problems. One is that the accuracy of an ordinary
3D printer is not enough, so it is difficult to accurately manufacture
a needle tip with a diameter of 100 μm or less. The other issue
is that no expensive square
capillary tube is used, which is replaced by the standard 3D printed
project. At the same time, the operation of fabricating the microfluidic
chip is significantly simplified. Tubes and chips can be combined
with commercially available connectors. All of these have reduced
the difficulty in the fabrication of microfluidic chips and improved
the operability and repeatability of the experimental process. The
liquid paraffin cuts the dispersed phase fluid into microdroplets,
followed by the crosslinking of microdroplets by calcium chloride.
As shown in Figure 7a, the diameter of the dried microspheres was about 150 μm
and elemental mapping images (Figure 7b–d) indicated that Si, Zr, and Mg were distributed
in microspheres homogeneously.

Figure 7 SEM images (a) and elemental mapping images
of the multimodule composite microspheres;
(b–d) distribution of
Si, Zr, and Mg in microspheres, respectively; (e) effect of dispersed
phase flow rate (Qw) and continuous phase
flow rate (Qo) on the size of the microdroplets;
and (f) distribution of diameters of the dried microspheres.

As shown in Figure 7e, the diameter of the microdroplet can be
conveniently controlled
by adjusting the flow rate of the two-phase fluid. The obtained microdroplets
have a smaller diameter when the flow rate of the dispersed phase
is low, which is favorable for the diffusion of the reactants in the
catalyst during the catalytic process. However, if the flow rate is
too slow, the yield of the assembled microdroplets is low, so the
flow rates of the disperse phase and the continuous phase are selected
as 1.5 and 80 mL h–1, respectively.

The microspheres
undergo subsequent heat treatment so that the
cross-linked sodium alginate partially dehydrates and carbonizes to
expose more pores and promote material transportation. The coefficient
of variation of the assembled microspheres’ diameter (Figure 7f) was 4.7%. The
specific surface area and pore volume of the assembled multimodules
microspheres were 439.51 m2 g–1 and 0.42
cm3 g–1, respectively (Figure 4 and Table S2).

Two composite oxide mesoporous nanoparticles were
used to catalyze
deacetalization and Knoevenagel reactions to investigate their acid
and base catalytic properties, respectively. From the curve of conversion
rate versus time, the deacetalization and Knoevenagel reactions catalyzed
by the acid and base are both first-order reactions (Figure 8). The reaction rate coefficients
are 86.82 and 0.085 h–1, respectively. The turnover
frequency (TOF) values of ZrO2–SiO2 and
MgO–SiO2 catalysts are 1076.6 and 1.76 h–1, respectively. From the rate coefficients and TOF values, it can
be seen that the deacetalization reaction proceeds faster than the
Knoevenagel reaction.

Figure 8 Results simulated by the first-order kinetic model: (a)
deacetalization
reaction and (b) Knoevenagel reaction.

The catalytic activity of bifunctional microspheres was investigated
by the deacetalization–Knoevenagel cascade reaction. First,
the content of complex oxides in the microspheres was explored (Figure 9a).

Figure 9 Catalytic performances
of multimodule microspheres with different
solid contents (a) and the different mass ratios of catalytic modules
(b) in “one-pot” deacetalization–Knoevenagel
condensation reactions (A: ZrO2–SiO2;
B: MgO–SiO2).

Keeping the same mass ratio of ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 microspheres, changing the
solid
content in the dispersed phase can significantly change the catalytic
efficiency. When the content of the solid catalyst in the dispersed
phase is 10%, its efficiency is the highest. The conversion of reactant
benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal can reach 99%, and the yield of the final
product reaches 84% (Table 2). If the solid content is too high or too low, the conversion
of the reactants will be reduced. This is because the higher the solid
content in the dispersed phase, the higher the density of the resulting
microspheres and thus the smaller the number of microspheres per mass
catalyst. This is not conducive to the sufficient contact between
the reactants and the catalyst in the heterogeneous reaction when
the number of microspheres is small; thus, the catalytic efficiency
is reduced. When the solid content in the dispersed phase is too small,
although the number of microspheres per unit mass of the catalyst
is significant, every single microsphere has little catalytically
active substances, which is also not conducive to the catalytic reaction.
Therefore, 10% of solids in the dispersed phase is the optimal content.

Contents Were Used as Catalysts for the Cascade Reaction

a Solid content of microspheres; the
mass ratio of ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 microspheres was 1:1.

Due to the atomic percentages of Zr and Mg in the same mass
composite oxides of the two catalysts is different. At the same time,
the rates of the two reactions are also different (Figure 9b). Therefore, the proportion
of ZrO2–SiO2 and MgO–SiO2 in the bifunctional microspheres will also influence their catalytic
activity.

Table 3 shows that
when the microspheres contain only ZrO2–SiO2 the first-step reaction can be performed well with an acetal
conversion rate of 99%, but only 17% of the final product is formed
because of the lack of a base. However, when only MgO–SiO2 is contained, the conversion rate of acetal is not high,
only 41%, because there are fewer acid sites. However, since it can
catalyze the Knoevenagel reaction as a solid base, the yield of the
final product is 30%. In the microspheres, the optimal ratio of the
two catalytic components is 8:2. At this point, the acetal conversion
is 99% and the final product yields 92%. At this ratio, the atomic
ratio of Zr and Mg in the microspheres is close to 1:2.5.

From the above
results, we can see that even if the rate constant
of the Knoevenagel reaction is far less than that of deacetalization
the presence of a small amount of MgO can still make the second-step
reaction of cascade reaction proceed efficiently. The rate constants
of the two reactions have a difference of 1021 times. The second reaction,
Knoevenagel reaction, is the rate-determining step in the cascade
reaction. However, the residual amount of intermediate products (benzaldehyde)
in the cascade reaction was always at a low level (Figure 10) when the microspheres were
used as a catalyst. This may be due to the fact that the distance
between acidic catalytic centers and alkaline centers is very short
because of assembling and the intermediate products produced at the
acid center can rapidly contact the basic active center, thereby converting
into the final product.

Figure 10 Evolution of the reactant (acetal, solid blue
triangles), intermediate
product (benzaldehyde, solid red circles), and the final product (benzylidene
malononitrile, solid black squares) versus reaction time; microspheres
of 10%-8:2 were used as catalysts.

Control experiments show that pure sodium alginate microspheres
can hardly produce a catalytic effect on the reaction (Table 4). Therefore, the use of sodium
alginate as a cross-linking agent does not affect the catalytic results.
Also, when mesoporous SiO2 alone is used as a catalyst,
since SiO2 is both acidic and basic, it can partially catalyze
the cascade reaction. However, its acidity and alkalinity are weak,
so the conversion and yield of the reaction are quite low.

These dual-function microspheres
assembled from simple modules
can provide more functionality by continuing to add functional modules.
For example, magnetic Fe3O4 particles were also
compounded into microspheres by self-assembly to form trifunctional
microspheres. The saturation susceptibility of composite microspheres
is 7.2 emu g–1 (Figure 11a).

and multimodules microspheres at 300 K in the applied magnetic field
ranging from −20 000 to 20 000 Oe; the illustration
was the magnetic separation process of microspheres. (b) Recycling
tests of microspheres during the deacetalization–Knoevenagel
cascade reaction; the illustration was a comparison of the catalysts
before and after use.

After the catalytic reaction is over, the catalyst can be
conveniently
removed by applying a magnetic field. At the same time, the conversion
and final yield of the reactants can still reach 96 and 92% (Table 4), respectively, which
are similar to the results when a nonmagnetic bifunctional catalyst
is used. The addition of the magnetic function does not have any adverse
effect on the catalytic reaction. The functions among the modules
are mutually orthogonal and do not interfere with each other. The
results of the repeated use of the catalysts showed that after the
fifth cycle (Figure 11b) the reaction yield did not reduce too much. After several reuse
cycles, the color of catalysts changes from light yellow to yellowish
brown, indicating that the macromolecular organics were deposited
in the pores of catalysts. They will cover part of the active sites.
However, there is no significant change in the surface of the microspheres
(Figure 12). Also,
the catalysts were partially pulverized during use, which will result
in the loss of active ingredients.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
in this work, nanoparticles with acid–base catalytic
properties and magnetic properties were used as building blocks to
fabricate the microsphere system with multifunctional integration.
The microspheres show a high catalytic performance on the acid–base
cascade reaction and can be removed by the external magnetic field.
The preparation of solid elements is simple, but the function of the
composite microspheres is complex. With the assembly process in the
microdroplets, the diameter and composition of the microspheres can
be quickly adjusted to achieve the precise control of the function.
Using different mesoporous silica materials as catalysts, the catalytic
process in the cascade catalytic reaction can be conveniently studied.
As can be seen from above, this modular self-assembly preparation
method fully reflects the enormous power of complexity resulting from
simplicity. This method provides a useful reference and practical
technical support for the design and fabrication of other multifunctional-integrated
“All-in-One”
materials.

were polished with sandpaper (CC88P, P3000, MT, Inc.) so that the
inner capillary tip diameter was 150 μm. The outer tube was
fabricated by a 3D printer (Formlabs, Form 2). The round capillary

4.6 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the prepared mesoporous silica particles were obtained
at room temperature on a Rigaku D/MAX-2400 X-ray powder diffractor
(Japan) using Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40 kV and 10 mA.
The argon adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 87
K using a 3H-2000PSI analyzer. Surface areas were calculated by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and the pore volume and
pore size distributions were calculated using the density functional
theory model.57,58 The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were taken with a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM). The mesoporous structures of silica
materials were observed by an FEI TITAN 80-300 transmission electron
microscope (TEM). Magnetic characterization was carried out using
a VSM with fields up to 20 000 Oe and at a temperature of 300
K. Related ion concentration was collected on a PerkinElmer Optima
2000DV inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. An ESCALAB250
X-ray photoelectric spectrometer (Thermo VG Scientific) was used to
analyze the composition of elements on the nanoparticles. Droplets
and microspheres were first observed with a Phantom camera (MIRO C210,
York Technologies Ltd.). Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia/carbon
dioxide (NH3/CO2-TPD) was performed on Builder
PCA-1200. Concentrations of reactants and products were determined
by a gas chromatograph (GC7900, TECHCOMP).
