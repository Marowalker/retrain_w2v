Sulfobetaines (SBs) are a class of
zwitterionic surfactants with
a reputation for enhancing colloidal stability at high salt concentrations.
Here, we present a systematic study on the self-assembly of SB amphiphiles
(sultaines or hydroxysultaines) in aqueous solutions, as a function
of chain length and composition, ionic strength, and in the presence
of alkanethiol-coated Au nanoparticles (GNPs). The diameters of the
micelles assembled from SB and amidosulfobetaine (ASB) generally increase
monotonically with chain length, although ASB micelles are smaller
relative to alkyl SB micelles with similarly sized tailgroups, and
oleyl sulfobetaine (OSB) micelles are slightly larger. SB amphiphiles
can stabilize alkanethiol-coated GNPs in physiologically relevant
buffers at concentrations well below their CMC, with size increases
corresponding to single-particle encapsulation. SB-encapsulated GNPs
were prepared by three different methods with SB:GNP weight ratios
of 10:1, followed by dispersion in water or 1 M NaCl. The low hydrodynamic
size of the SB micelles and SB-coated NPs is within the range needed
for efficient renal clearance.

Introduction
Amphiphilic molecules
are well known to self-assemble into aggregate
species above a critical concentration. Micelles are the simplest
and most common type of self-organized assemblies, and are traditionally
depicted as cores of close-packed hydrophobic tails surrounded by
hydrophilic headgroups, resulting in maximum system entropy.1,2 Such micelles are ubiquitous in soaps and detergents, and have also
drawn attention as nanosized capsules for dyes,3 drugs,4 and inorganic nanoparticles
(NPs),5−8 and as catalyst supports in aqueous solution, wherein the biphasic
interface is confined to volumes of a few nanometers.9,10

Low-molecular-weight (LMW) amphiphiles can be classified as
having
headgroups that are charged (anionic or cationic), uncharged (nonionic),
or amphoteric (zwitterionic). Zwitterionic surfactants are electroneutral
yet easily dispersed in high ionic strength solutions, and their reputation
for biocompatibility is of great interest to the pharmaceutical and
cosmetic industries; for example, phosphatidylcholines are often used
in emollients to retain body moisture or treat skin diseases.11 In materials science, zwitterionic surfactants
can serve as novel charge injection materials for faster device response
times in organic light-emitting diodes,12 or as electrolytes that can combine high ionic mobility with water
retention in solid-state supercapacitors.13

Zwitterionic coatings are also well known for their ability
to
minimize nonspecific protein interactions across a broad pH range.14−17 This is especially important in drug delivery and nanomedicine,
as the adsorption of complement proteins and other opsonins can lead
to rapid clearance by circulating macrophages.18,19 Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has long been used to minimize protein
fouling;20 however, the PEG layer increases
the hydrodynamic size (dh) by at least
several nanometers21 and can prohibit renal
elimination of nanosized carriers.22,23 There are
also several studies suggesting that PEG may be immunogenic, possibly
compromising the efficacy of PEGylated therapeutics in multidose regimens
for follow-up treatments of cancer and other chronic diseases.20,24,25

Previous studies have shown
that renal clearance is size-dependent
for NPs between 5.5 and 13 nm.22,23 Particles with dh values above this threshold have little chance
of elimination through the renal pathway, whereas particles below
5.5 nm are efficiently cleared by glomerular filtration. Renal elimination
is a key process for preventing the toxic accumulation of theranostic
agents or NPs in the reticuloendothelial system. Micellar structures
assembled from LMW zwitterions are likely to fit within this size
window,26,27 although particle analysis supporting this
assumption has yet to be established.

Here, we provide a comprehensive
study on the micelle-forming properties
of single-chain sulfobetaines (SBs) as a function of molecular structure
and at different ionic strengths. SBs are zwitterionic surfactants
with 1-(N,N)-dimethylammonium-3-sulfopropyl
or -2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl headgroups that are widely used in the
food, detergent, and petroleum industries. We focus primarily on commercially
available sultaines or hydroxysultaines, some having already established
a reputation for low toxicity.11,28 We include a novel
sultaine prepared from oleylamine for comparison against fully saturated
SBs, and use dynamic light scattering (DLS) to characterize concentration-dependent
micellization down to 50 μM. We also study the self-assembly
behavior of SB amphiphiles in the presence of alkanethiol-coated gold
nanoparticles (GNPs) as a model for nanoscale encapsulation, using
several different methods of preparation. We find that SB-coated GNPs
can form stable aqueous dispersions at concentrations far below the
CMC of the supporting surfactant.

Results and Discussion
Analysis
by DLS
DLS was used as the primary tool for
characterizing SB self-assembly behavior, as quantified by hydrodynamic
size (dh), critical micelle concentration
(CMC), and aggregation number (g). DLS studies were
performed on SBs as a function of concentration in both deionized
water and 1 M NaCl (Figure 1). Number-based distributions were used to obtain mode peak
values and CMC thresholds; although these tend to be less sensitive
than intensity-based distributions (see below), they are less affected
by adventitious particles that can generate artifacts or improperly
skew the size distribution.29

Figure 1 DLS characterization
for SBs as a function of concentration in
H2O and 1 M NaCl: (a) C12SB; (b) CAHS; (c) C14SB; (d) C16SB;
(e) C18SB; (f) oleyl sulfobetaine (OSB); (g) C14-amidosulfobetaine
(ASB); (h) C16-ASB. All measurements performed in triplicate at room
temperature (rt); samples were prepared at least 1 h in advance prior
to analysis. Apparent CMC values for each SB are based on thresholds
for signal detection by DLS (circled).

Most SBs exhibit sharp transitions in micellization at characteristic
concentrations, with aggregate sizes of 4–7 nm that remain
constant at higher solute levels. In the case of C16SB in water, nanosized
micelles are formed even in supersaturated solutions (>1.3 mM).
The
threshold values by DLS correlate well with the CMC values for lower
MW surfactants (C12SB, C14SB),26 although
they are higher than those based on surface tension or isothermal
calorimetry.27,30 We also observed SB micellization
to occur at lower concentrations in 1 M NaCl versus pure water, again
in accord with an earlier work.26 Although
DLS is not a standard tool for measuring CMCs in absolute terms,2 the instrument used in this study can detect
signals from organic aggregates (1–100 kDa) at a limit close
to 1 μg/mL.31 This gives us confidence
to use DLS signal thresholds to define apparent CMCs for practical
purposes, namely, comparing micelle formation in water versus 1 M
NaCl (Table 1).

The maximum dh of micelles assembled
from alkyl SBs (C12–C18) increases monotonically with tailgroup
length, in proportion to their extended conformations, as measured
using geometry-optimized models (Figures 2 and S2). The
same trend is observed for the amidopropyl SB derivatives CAHS, C14-ASB,
and C16-ASB, although their micelles are smaller relative to those
formed from alkyl SBs with similar tailgroup sizes. Interestingly,
OSB produces nearly the same size micelles in 1 M NaCl as those of
C18SB, despite having a shorter overall length (ca. 10%) due to its
C9–C10 cis double bond. It is also worth noting that for all
micelle-forming SBs in this study, ionic strength has no significant
impact on hydrodynamic size, at least within the resolution of DLS.
This suggests that hydration of the SB headgroups does not contribute
meaningfully toward dh.

Figure 2 SB micelle sizes as a
function of tailgroup chain length. Hydrodynamic
sizes (dh) are based on 10 mM surfactant
in 1 M NaCl. Molecular lengths (upper x axis) are
based on single molecules in fully extended conformations. *Tailgroup
length for OSB is 18 atoms.

All micelle-forming SBs have a lower apparent CMC in 1 M
NaCl relative
to that in pure water, indicating greater micellar stability at high
ionic strength.26 We note that neither
OSB nor C18SB formed nanosized micelles in pure water at rt, although
much larger aggregates could be observed by eye and removed with a
membrane filter. In contrast, all SB surfactant solutions in 1 M NaCl
were optically clear, with no visible evidence of aggregates at the
highest concentrations evaluated.

In addition to particle sizes
and CMC values, DLS can measure molecular
aggregation numbers (g) based on the molecular weight
of the micellar materials (Table 1 and Figure S3). Aggregation
numbers can be useful for formulating stoichiometries between excipient
(host material) and prospective encapsulants. As expected, the number
of SB molecules per micelle increases with alkyl chain length; however,
the trend does not support the simple assumption of isotropic micelles,
for which g should increase roughly as a function
of nC2, where nC is the number of tailgroup carbon atoms.33 Instead, empirical g values
for C12SB through C18SB increase with nC4 such that the molecular volumes remain approximately
constant, implying a greater packing density. One possible explanation
is a transition to anisotropic micelles at higher nC values, but additional studies would be needed to elucidate
the structures of these self-assembled NPs.

Micellar Encapsulation
of Hydrophobic Nanoparticles
Given their widespread use as
excipients in consumer products, single-chain
SBs could be useful for stabilizing hydrophobic NPs intended for biomedical
applications,18 while maintaining their
hydrodynamic sizes within the threshold for renal clearance. To test
this possibility, we conducted studies with the C16SB surfactant using
3 nm GNPs coated with dodecanethiol (C12-SH) as the encapsulant. Micellar
encapsulation is actually a hybrid phenomenon driven by the thermodynamics
of both self-assembly and surface adsorption, the latter having additional
parameters based on the radius of curvature and interaction potentials
between surface, surfactant, and medium.1,2 The encapsulation
of C12-SH-stabilized GNPs by single-chain surfactants is expected
to be highly favorable, as the interdigitation of alkyl surfactant
chains into the alkanethiol monolayer supports a stable interface.34,35 However, the solubilization of hydrophobic NPs can create kinetic
barriers that hinder their efficient encapsulation by micellar surfactants;
thus, practical mechanisms for NP encapsulation need to be addressed.

Three methods for encapsulating GNPs by SB micelles in water and
1 M NaCl were investigated: (a) the addition of citrate-stabilized
GNPs to preformed SB micelles containing C12-SH; (b) the gradual removal
of co-solvent from microemulsions of C12-SH coated GNPs mixed with
SB micelles; and (c) the solid-state mixing of SB surfactants and
C12-SH coated GNPs using mechanochemical (grinding) methods (Figure 3). Surfactants are
often employed as grinding aids for reducing particle size during
ball-milling processes (comminution),36,37 but to our
knowledge grinding is not widely used for micelle formation and encapsulation.
However, solid-state mixing in the absence of solvent has been applied
for the supramolecular encapsulation of fullerenes and other polyaromatic
hydrocarbons.38,39 We thus compared mechanochemical
encapsulation against solution-based methods.

Figure 3 Methods for preparing
C12-SH-coated GNPs encapsulated in C16SB
micelles: (a) encapsulation in preformed micelles containing C16SB
and C12-SH (aqueous assembly); (b) microemulsion of C12-SH-coated
GNPs and SB surfactants; (c) mechanochemical mixing prior to dissolution.

For NP encapsulation in monophasic
solution (aqueous assembly),
a 2.4 wt % solution of C16SB was prepared in water or 1 M NaCl, followed
by addition of C12-SH (6.5 mol %) with agitation by vortex action
to form mixed micelles. DLS was conducted on serial dilutions of the
C16SB/C12-SH mixtures, indicating that the corresponding micelles
had the same dh (5 nm) as those produced
from C16SB alone, but with a higher CMC (0.2 mM) and a sharper transition
(Figure 4a). Similar
observations were made for the C16SB/C12-SH mixtures prepared in 1
M NaCl (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 DLS characterization
of C16SB/C12-SH micelles and encapsulated
GNPs, using the methods described in Figure 3. Encapsulation and serial dilutions were
performed in (a) water and (b) 1 M NaCl.

Citrate-stabilized 3 nm GNPs were then added to a 0.04 wt
% solution
of C16SB/C12-SH, with vortex mixing for 2 min. On the basis of simple
weight ratios, roughly 10% of these mixed micelles contain GNPs, which
is the same estimate based on an initial micelle-to-GNP ratio of 10:1.
DLS analysis revealed an increase in mean dh from 5.0 to 6.2 nm (Figures 4a and S4a). The stability of the
GNPs encapsulated by mixed micelles in 1 M NaCl was also monitored
for up to 1 week, with only modest changes in dh and optical density (Figure S4b,c), whereas the citrate-stabilized GNPs began to aggregate within
minutes after dispersion in 1 M NaCl without C12-SH, and with or without
C16SB (Figure S4d).

The effective
CMC of the mixed-surfactant encapsulation system
is considerably lower than that of the free surfactant. For example,
GNPs encapsulated by C16SB could be detected after dilution to 50
μM surfactant (19.6 μg/mL), well below its CMC value of
80 μM, with further dilutions in concentration still possible.
The enhanced stability can be attributed to cooperative adsorption
of SB surfactants and C12-SH onto the 3 nm GNPs. The lower effective
CMC may also be helpful in addressing some safety concerns over the
use of LMW surfactants for drug delivery, namely, their premature
dissolution and dispersion into off-target cells and organs.18 In this regard, we note that although single-chain
surfactants have a reputation for hemolytic activity, zwitterionic
species appear to be less toxic than their charged counterparts,40 and no toxicological effects of dimethylammoniopropyl
SBs have been reported thus far.28

For NP encapsulation under microemulsion conditions, a 0.04 wt
% solution of C16SB (in water and 1 M NaCl) was combined in a 1:1
ratio with C12-SH coated GNPs in toluene with sonication to produce
a milky solution, followed by removal of the organic phase by centrifugal
evaporation for several hours until a clear phase was achieved, with
readjustment in volume to restore the original molarities. DLS analysis
of the final dispersions indicated similar dh values (ca. 7 nm) to those of the micelle-stabilized GNPs
prepared under monophasic conditions, again with a lower effective
CMC relative to the free C16SB (Figure 4). The stability and similarity of the encapsulated
products and the absence of hysteresis effects using either preparation
method indicate thermodynamic control of encapsulation.

For
NP encapsulation by solid-state mixing, C16SB was combined
with C12-SH-coated GNPs in dry powder form using the same mole ratio
as above, then ground by mortar and pestle for several minutes until
a homogeneous mixture was achieved. Dispersions of this solid in water
or 1 M NaCl produced optically clear solutions that again yielded
particles with a mean size of 6.6 nm. TEM imaging with negative staining
confirmed the micellar encapsulation of individual GNPs, as well as
a significant population of empty micelles (Figure 5). We note that although grinding is a convenient
method for micellar encapsulation, its efficiency may be lower than
the other two approaches, as determined by a gradual loss in dispersion
stability after 12 h.

Conclusions
Single-chain
sulfobetaines form well-defined micelles above their
CMCs at both low and high ionic strength. DLS was found to be a useful
and practical surrogate for classical methods of CMC determination
and yielded quantitative values for hydrodynamic size and aggregation
number. The increases in micelle diameters were directly related to
surfactant chain length but independent of ionic strength, although
the latter had a significant impact on CMC values. Three methods of
encapsulating 3 nm Au particles with dodecanethiol within SB micelles
were investigated, all of which produced assemblies of 6–7
nm, confirming single-particle encapsulation. The stability of encapsulated
GNPs at low concentrations indicate these assemblies to be stable
below the CMCs of the supporting SB surfactant, and within the size
window for rapid renal clearance.

Experimental Section
Materials
Most sulfobetaines were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received unless otherwise stated. 3-(N,N-Dimethyloctadecylammonio)sulfopropyl betaine
(C18SB) was purchased from Be Pharm; 3-(N,N-dimethylpalmitoylaminopropyl)ammonio)sulfopropyl
betaine (amidosulfobetaine-14 or C14-ASB) and 3-(N,N-dimethylmyristoylaminopropyl)ammonio)
sulfopropyl betaine (amidosulfobetaine-16 or C16-ASB) were purchased
from G-Biosciences; 3-(N,N-dimethyllaurylaminopropyl)ammonio)-2-hydroxysulfopropyl
betaine (cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine or CAHS) was purchased from
Organic Creations and purified by preparative liquid chromatography.
3-(N,N-Dimethyloleylammonio)sulfopropyl
betaine (OSB) was synthesized according to Scheme 1 (see below). Citrate-capped GNPs were purchased
from Nanopartz and purified by ultracentrifugation at 105g for 30 min to remove larger colloidal species
from solution, with a final mean size of 3 nm (Figure S1a).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of OSB
Instrumentation
Optical absorption spectra were recorded
on a Cary-50 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Varian). DLS measurements
were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS system (Malvern) equipped
with noninvasive backscatter optics and a He—Ne laser at 633
nm. All DLS data were collected at 25 °C in triplicate, with dh values based on number-weighted size distributions
(see below).29 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were acquired using a Tecnai T20 (FEI) operating at 200
kV with a CCD camera (Gatan US1000, 2k × 2k pixels). Negative
staining was performed using 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA). Particle
size distributions based on TEM image analysis were calculated using
SigmaScan Pro (SPSS Inc.)

Synthesis of OSB
Oleylamine was
converted to OSB in
two steps, using Eschweiler–Clarke methylation to form N,N-dimethyloleylamine followed by ring
opening of γ-sultone (Scheme 1). Reagent-grade cis-oleylamine (1.0
g, 3.74 mmol) was first heated at 50 °C for 1 h under vacuum
in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask to reverse carbamate formation and
dispel trace CO2, then cooled to rt. The carbamate-depleted
oleylamine was treated with 88% formic acid (0.98 g, 18.7 mmol) and
a 37% aqueous solution of formaldehyde (0.82 mL), with observation
of gas evolution upon addition. The reaction mixture was heated to
reflux for at least 8 h, with further gas evolution observed during
the first few hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness
then redissolved in toluene (1 mL), neutralized with aqueous NaOH
(1 mL of a 1 M solution), then concentrated by rotary evaporation
and further dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene. The product
could be purified by chromatography, or taken forward to the next
step without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.30–5.37 (m, 2H), 2.28–2.32 (m,
2H), 2.26 (s, 6H), 1.99 (q, 4H, J = 6.2 Hz), 1.47
(quint, 2H, J = 6.5 Hz), 1.20–1.38 (m, 22H),
0.86 (t, 3H, J = 6.8 Hz). 13C NMR (101

31.89, 29.72, 29.51, 29.46, 29.30, 29.22, 27.40, 27.35, 27.18, 22.67,
14.10.

Dimethyloleylamine (200 mg, 0.677 mmol) was dissolved
in anhydrous ethyl acetate (EtOAc; 0.1 mL), treated dropwise with
1,3-propanesultone (124 mg, 1.01 mmol) in anhydrous EtOAc (0.2 mL),
then heated to 70 °C for 6 h using an oil bath, or for 1 h using
a microwave reactor during which a white precipitate formed. The reaction
mixture was centrifuged to collect the white solid, which was washed
with cold EtOAc and ether then dried in vacuum to yield 240 mg of
OSB as a white solid (85% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD): δ 5.35 (m, 2H), 3.50 (m, 2H), 3.30 (m, 2H), 3.08
(s, 6H), 2.86 (t, 2H, J = 6.9 Hz), 2.18 (m, 2H),
2.00 (m, 4H), 1.77 (m, 2H), 1.32 (m, 26H), 4.41 (t, 3H, J = 6.6 Hz). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD): δ

30.22, 28.14, 27.41, 23.71, 23.48, 19.89, 14.45. ESI-MS: calcd for
C23H47NO3S[M]+m/z 418.33; found: m/z 418.40. This compound is stable for at least 1 year if
carefully stored at −20 °C under argon to prevent air
oxidation.

Quantification of Saturation Conditions in
Water and 1 M NaCl
This procedure was developed to obtain
accurate concentration values
of solutions saturated with surfactants having low solubility. For
solubility in pure water, saturated solutions were prepared by dispersing
50 mg of surfactant in 10–100 mL (depending on initial observations),
then heated to reflux with a condenser to remove all signs of turbidity
or precipitation. The solutions were gradually cooled to rt and left
standing for at least 2 days without evaporation, to achieve full
equilibrium between solvation and precipitation. The precipitated
surfactant was collected by centrifugation in a tared container and
carefully separated by extracting the supernatant with a pipette,
and was then passed through a 0.2 μm filter (>99% volume
recovery).
The supernatant was dried in a tared vial by lyophilization, then
weighed with ±0.01 mg precision for estimating solution saturation.
The precipitate was also carefully dried and weighed to confirm minimum
attrition in mass recovery.

For solubility in 1 M NaCl, saturated
solutions were prepared in the same manner as above, except that the
precipitate was collected after centrifugation and washed carefully
with water (3 × 1 mL) to remove residual salt. The precipitate
was dried in a tared vial by lyophilization, then weighed with ±0.01
mg precision for estimating solution saturation.

Hydrodynamic
Size Analysis and Aggregation Number by DLS
All DLS analyses
were performed in triplicate at rt using number-based
distributions, with hydrodynamic sizes (dh) of micelles based on mode peak values. Serial dilutions were prepared
down to 10 μM, which remained above the limit of detection of
our instrument (see below). Aggregation numbers (g) were estimated by measuring the refractive index increment (dn/dc) of aqueous SB solutions using an
Abbe refractometer, and incorporating these values into Debye plots
to obtain the effective mass of the micellar ensemble, divided by
the molecular mass of the SB unit (Table 1 and Supporting Information).

Synthesis of Alkanethiol-Capped GNPs
Dodecanethiol
(C12-SH)-capped GNPs were prepared at rt using the procedure reported
by Leff et al. with some modifications.41 An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.0458 mmol, 1.5 mL) in
a 5 mL round-bottomed flask was treated with rapid magnetic stirring
with 0.1 M tetraoctylammonium bromide in toluene (0.102 mmol, 1.02
mL). The initially yellow solution immediately turned into a biphasic
mixture with an orange organic phase; the mixture was vigorously shaken
several times until the aqueous phase was completely colorless. The
biphasic mixture was then treated with 42 mM C12-SH in toluene (0.023
mmol, 0.55 mL), followed by dropwise addition of 0.4 M NaBH4 in water (0.503 mmol, 1.25 mL) with vigorous stirring, causing the
organic phase to rapidly darken to wine-red then brownish-black. The
biphasic reaction mixture was allowed to stir for another 12 h prior
to separation of the organic layer, which was mixed with 80 mL of
absolute ethanol then cooled and stored at −20 °C overnight
for precipitation. The supernatant was then carefully separated from
the precipitate, which was resuspended in fresh ethanol and stored
at −20 °C under an argon atmosphere. TEM and DLS analysis
indicated a mean size of 3.2 nm, and mode dh of 3.0 nm (Figure S1b).
