The development of
effective protection strategies is essential
in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates and glycomimetics. This
article describes a versatile four-stage protocol for the synthesis
of α- or β-aryl-C-glycosides from unprotected d-glycals using two acetal protecting groups, ethoxyethyl and
methoxypropyl, which are stable under harsh basic conditions and convenient
for the C-1 metalation of glycals. Their stability was investigated
in subsequent cross-coupling reactions with 1-iodonaphthalene followed
by oxidative/reductive transformations to naphthyl-C-glycosides.

Introduction
Recent development
of glycobiology1 has
increased the need for the synthesis of structurally defined carbohydrates
and their analogues. Among them, C-glycosides2 are important analogues of carbohydrates, which
exhibit high stability toward chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis and
include many bioactive natural products3 and commercial drugs.4 Because of their
stability and broad range of biological activities, access to C-glycosides is of great importance.

Several common
synthetic approaches,2e,2f,3b including methods using cationic, anionic, or radical
sugar species, as well as methods using de novo construction of the
sugar or aromatic moiety for the synthesis of aryl-C-glycoside scaffolds, were used in the past. However, these methods
are often hard to carry out stereoselectively and are not universal
across sugar substrates. Therefore, alternative approaches including
transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions2e,2f,3b (Heck, Suzuki, Stille, and Negishi-type
reactions) have been developed for the synthesis of C-glycosides employing metalated glycals and aromatic electrophiles
as key starting materials. Nevertheless, the preparation of 1-metalated
glycals usually relies upon the lithiation of the C-1 position of
protected glycals by a strong base. Lithiation conditions are harsh,
and some common protecting groups such as benzyl5a or tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)5b,5c ethers compete for lithiation. Several protecting groups that survive
the metalation of glycals by t-BuLi have been gradually
developed (triisopropylsilyl,6 di-tert-butylsilylene,6b,6c,7 TBS,5,6c,8tert-butyldiphenylsilyl,5a,9 triethylsiyl,10 methoxymethyl (MOM),7,11 and isopropylidene11,12), but they all suffer from one or more disadvantages, which precludes
their general applicability (Figure 1). These include, for example, the requirement of 3–6
equiv of t-BuLi for glycal deprotonation, presumably
due to complexation effects. Besides that, the deprotection of silyl
ethers with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride is usually
complicated by problems in separating the product from tetrabutylammonium
salts. Moreover, silyl ethers are not universal protecting groups
across pyranoid substrates (d-glucal, d-galactal,
etc.), which makes it necessary to discover the efficient combination
of protecting groups for each application. Next, silyl groups are
quite expensive for multigram synthesis and the combination of MOM
and isopropylidene groups requires multistep protection. Finally,
silyl ether-protected cross-coupling products are often inconvenient
for further transformation to α- or β-C-glycosides, presumably due to the bulkiness of the protecting groups
and for ring-strain reasons.6b,13 In view of the aforementioned,
it is obvious that the development of alternative protection strategies
would facilitate progress in the synthesis of aryl-C-glycosides from glycals.

and d-galactal by t-BuLi.

Results and Discussion
We have found
that the utilization of rarely used ethoxyethyl14 (EE) or methoxypropyl15 (MOP)
acetal protecting groups (Figure 1) offers several advantages. Although these
protecting groups have been used for orthogonal protection in carbohydrate
chemistry, their use for glycals has not yet been described. Specifically,
EE and MOP protecting groups are cheap and enable mild conditions
for their introduction and removal. Nevertheless, they are stable
under strong basic conditions. This article suggests that EE and MOP
can be universal protecting groups across pyranoid glycals and convenient
for further transformation of cross-coupling products to the corresponding
α- or β-C-glycosides.

First, we
investigated the reaction conditions for the preparation
of fully protected glycals 2a–b and 3a–b. Specifically, we investigated commercially
available d-glucal 1a and d-galactal 1b, which reacted under standard conditions with 2-methoxypropene16 or ethyl vinyl ether17 in the presence of pyridinium tosylate, yielding fully protected
glycals 2a–b and 3a–b in 79–95% yields. Remarkably, the reaction of 2-methoxypropene
with cis-1,2-diol such as d-galactal 1b leads to the formation of isopropylidene acetal on the
secondary hydroxyls (3a), whereas the reaction with trans-1,2-diol such as d-glucal 1a introduces MOP groups selectively. In the reaction with ethyl vinyl
ether, no such selectivity has been observed and per-EE products have
been obtained in both cases (Scheme 1). Surprisingly, the subsequent reaction of 3a with t-BuLi formed racemic open-chain enone 4 in 81% yield (the enantiomeric composition was determined
by derivatization by (S)-Mosher’s acid and
NMR analysis (see Supporting Information (SI) Chapter 2, Scheme 2)).

Scheme 2 Reaction of 3a with t-BuLi
Next, since the protection
of glycals with ethyl vinyl ether produced
fully protected glycals as a mixture of eight possible diastereoisomers,
it was crucial to find a simple and efficient method to prove the
structure of these compounds by NMR. Therefore, we first attempted
to deprotect EE glycals 2b and 3b using
5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in MeOH-d4 directly in the NMR tube; however, this method suffered from
partial decomposition of substrates. Fortunately, switching the 5%
TFA to 10% (v/v) CD3COOD in MeOH-d4 and heating the mixture to 50 °C for 0.75–2 h
in the NMR tube enabled the complete cleavage of EE groups. Using
this in situ deprotection protocol, we were able to confirm the structure
of EE-protected compounds by NMR (for details, see the SI, Chapter 4).

Since our interest was
focused on the synthesis of C-glycosides using Suzuki
and Stille reactions, fully protected d-glucals 2a–b and d-galactal 3b were
converted into 1-lithiated intermediates
by treatment with t-BuLi and then reacted with Bu3SnCl or iPrOBPin, followed by quenching with
water. In all cases (Table 1, entries 1–6), the reaction proceeded cleanly, providing
the desired compounds 5a–b, 6a–b, 7, and 8 in almost quantitative yields (Table 1). The deprotonation of vinylic C1–H by t-BuLi usually requires 3–6 equiv of base.18 Therefore, it was important to find the optimal
lithiation conditions for the preparation of organometalated glycals
with EE and MOP protecting groups. We performed a series of lithiation
experiments on protected d-glucals 2a–b with t-BuLi, followed by deuteration with
D2O. In both cases, direct deprotonations of C1–H
required 3.5 equiv of t-BuLi (see the SI, Chapter 1). No evidence of competing deprotonation
on MOP or EE protecting groups was observed.

In our systematic study of EE and
MOP protecting groups, we also
tested the performance of the substituted glycals 5a–b, 6a–b, 7,
and 8 in cross-coupling reactions. As model reactions,
we investigated Suzuki–Miyaura and Stille reactions with 1-iodonaphthalene
(Table 2). The Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction of 1-pinacolboronates 5a, 5b, and 7 was performed under our previously published conditions6c (conditions A). In all cases, the expected cross-coupling
products 9a, 9b, and 10 were
obtained in high yields of 72–93% (Table 2, entries 1, 3, and 5).

a Isolated yield; reaction conditions:
(A) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME), Na2CO3, 80 °C; (B) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, 120 °C; (C) (1) t-BuLi,
InCl3, tetrahydrofuran (THF), (2) Pd(Ph3P)2Cl2, reflux; (D) (1) t-BuLi, ZnCl2, THF, (2) Pd(Ph3P)4.

The Stille reaction was carried
out under standard conditions.19 Specifically,
Pd(PPh3)4 was used as a catalyst and the reaction
was heated at 120 °C
for 12 h in toluene as the solvent. In these cases, the corresponding
1-stannylglycals 6a, 6b, and 8 were again converted to naphthyl-C-glycals 9a, 9b, and 10 in high yields of
72–86% (Table 2, entries 2, 4, and 6). Finally, we decided to prove the compatibility
of the EE protecting groups of 2b in Negishi-type20 and In-mediated6a coupling reactions with 1-iodonaphthalene (Table 2, entries 7 and 8). In both cases, the cross-coupling
product 9b was isolated in 20–43% yields. These
low yields were probably caused by the instability of EE protecting
groups in the presence of zinc and indium Lewis acids after quenching
with water.

In the next step, we investigated whether these
protected cross-coupling
products 9a, 9b, and 10 with
a reactive endocyclic double bond can be deprotected without damaging
the glycal double bond. To our surprise, the fully protected gluco
derivative 9a with MOP protecting groups was converted
to free enol ether 12 by stirring in the mixture of 1%
acetic acid and THF overnight. Similarly, the free cross-coupling
product 12 was achieved after the treatment of the EE-protected
derivative 9b with a mixture of 20% aqueous acetic acid
and THF (Scheme 3).

Since the control of the stereochemistry of C-glycosides
is essential for the preparation of the desired stereoisomer, it was
necessary to confirm that the EE- and MOP-protected derivatives 9a–b are stable during stereoselective
transformations,6c,21 leading to α- or β-aryl-C-glycosides. Compounds 9a and 9b with MOP and EE protecting groups served as
model compounds. It was found that hydroboration of the double bond
in 9a and 9b with the BH3·THF
complex followed by oxidation with alkaline hydrogen peroxide and
deprotection with diluted acetic acid in THF gave directly aryl-β-C-glycoside 11 as a single stereoisomer in
high overall yields (Scheme 3). The opposite anomer, naphthyl-α-C-glycoside 13, was obtained by epoxidation of the double
bond with dimethyldioxirane (DMDO), followed by the cleavage of the
formed epoxide ring with lithiumtriethylborohydride (LiBEt3H). The stereochemical outcome of these transformations is consistent
with results previously reported on the substituted glucal unit bearing
benzyl ether21,22b or silyl ether6b,6c protection. The reactions mentioned above were also carried out
with the free cross-coupling product 12; after hydroboration,
β-C-glycoside 11 was obtained
in high 84% yield (Scheme 3). On the other hand, the transformation of 12 to α-anomer 13 failed.

the Glucal Double Bond to α- or β-Aryl-C-glucosides 11 or 13,

20% AcOH/THF (1:1).

Finally, the protected 1-naphthylgalactal 10 was subjected
to subsequent stereoselective transformation. As we assumed, hydroboration
of derivative 10 with the BH3.THF complex
and deprotection with a mixture of 20% aqueous acetic acid and THF
provided free aryl-β-C-glycoside 14 in 69% overall yield (Scheme 4).

20% AcOH/MeOH (1:1).

Additionally, we also tested the Werz protocol,22 which was supposed to lead to β-aryl-C-galactoside 14 using DIBAL-H and LiAlH4 for
the opening of the epoxide ring. In both of these cases, the expected
derivative 14 was obtained after deprotection. The free
aryl-β-C-glycoside 14 was also
obtained by the hydroboration of the free cross-coupling product 15. As before, we decided to transform the coupled product 10 to the opposite naphthyl-α-C-glycoside.
Although the product of the DMDO epoxidation of derivative 10 was confirmed, the subsequent opening of the formed epoxide ring
with lithiumtriethylborohydride failed and derivative 16 with an opened galactose ring was isolated under the standard deprotection
conditions. Even though various attempts to modify reaction conditions,
workup procedures, and hydride sources were made, the desired α-C-galactoside with a closed sugar ring was not obtained
(Scheme 4).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have introduced ethoxyethyl and methoxypropyl
acetals as effective protecting groups for a straightforward and stereoselective
synthesis of α- or β-naphthyl-C-glycosides.
We have established that uniformly EE- and MOP-protected d-glycals are compatible with harsh basic conditions and are universal
protecting groups for both d-glucal and d-galactal.
Their stability was also proven in the subsequent Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions and the ensuing oxidative−reductive transformation.
We have also found that the complete removal of all EE or MOP groups
is high yielding and effective under mild acidic conditions. We assume
that this work can be extended to the synthesis of a wide range of
aryl-C-glycosides.

General
Experiment
All reactions using anhydrous conditions
were performed using flame-dried apparatus under an atmosphere of
argon. Standard inert techniques were used in handling all air and
moisture sensitive reagents. Anhydrous THF and CH2Cl2 were obtained by distillation using CaH2 as a
drying agent. Other anhydrous solvents were used directly as received
from commercial suppliers. All other solvents were used as supplied
(Analytical or high-performance liquid chromatography grade), without
prior purification. Reagents were purchased from various commercial
suppliers and used as supplied, unless otherwise indicated. Distilled
water was used for chemical reactions. “Hexane” refers
to the fraction of hexane boiling in the range 68–72 °C.
Brine refers to a saturated solution of sodium chloride. Anhydrous
magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was used as a drying agent after
reaction workup, as indicated.

obtained according to a literature procedure,23 stored at −20 °C under argon atmosphere, and used in
2 days after distillation at the latest. Column chromatography was
carried out using Material Harvest silica gel (pore size 60 Å,
mesh 230–400 (40–63 μm)). Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was carried out using Merck TLC Silica gel 60 F254 aluminum plates. Visualization of the TLC plates was achieved using
a UV lamp Spektroline-ENF-240/F (Spectronics Corporation Westbury)
(λmax = 254 nm) and/or by spraying with cerium(IV)
sulfate solution (1% in 10% H2SO4). Mobile phases
are reported in relative composition (e.g., hexane/EtOAc 1:1 v/v). All 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III 400 (401.0
MHz for 1H; 100.8 MHz for 13C) or Bruker Avance
III 500 (500.0 MHz for 1H; 125.7 MHz for 13C)
spectrometers. 1H and 13C resonances were fully
assigned using H,H-COSY, H,C-HSQC, and H,C-HMBC techniques. All chemical
shifts are quoted on the δ scale in ppm and referenced using
residual 1H solvent signal in 1H NMR spectra
(δ(CHCl3) = 7.26 ppm, δ(CD2HOD)
= 3.31 ppm, δ(CD2HCOCD3) = 2.05 ppm, and
δ(CD2HSOCD3) = 2.50 ppm) and 13C solvent signal in 13C NMR spectra (δ(CDCl3) = 77.0 ppm, δ(CD3OD) = 49.0 ppm, δ(CD3COCD3) = 29.8 ppm, and δ((CD3)2SO) = 29.7 ppm). Coupling constant (J) is
reported in Hz with the following splitting abbreviations: s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. IR spectra
were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Absorption
maxima (υmax) are reported in wavenumbers (cm–1).

on a LTQ Orbitrap XL
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) spectrometer using electrospray ionization
technique. Nominal and exact m/z values are reported in Daltons.

Optical rotations were measured
on an AUTOPOL IV (Rudolph Research
Analytical,) polarimeter at temperature 20 °C and 589 nm sodium
line with a path length l of 1.0 dm. Concentration c is given in g/100 mL. Specific rotation values are reported
as a unitless number with implied units of (deg mL)/(g dm). Melting
points (mp) were recorded on a Kofler hot-stage microscope and are
reported uncorrected in degrees Celsius (°C).
