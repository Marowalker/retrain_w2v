We investigated the H and H2 adsorption effects on the
stability of a Pt atom on various heteroatom-doped graphene supports
using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory.
We show that H and H2 adsorptions on the Pt atom weaken
the interaction between the Pt atom and graphene support and decrease
the adsorption energy of Pt atoms. H2 adsorption on Pt
atoms decreases the adsorption energy of Pt atoms on all graphene
supports by more than 30%, whereas H adsorption only affects pristine,
O-, and S-doped graphene. These results indicate that the hydrogen
atmosphere enhances the detachment of Pt catalysts. However, the B-,
O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene still maintained large adsorption
energies of PtH and PtH2 of more than 1.5 eV. In addition,
the diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 on pristine graphene
were calculated to be less than 0.07 eV, which further demonstrated
that H and H2 enhance the degradation of Pt catalysts.
Even after H and H2 adsorptions on a Pt atom, O-, Si-,
P-doped, and monovacant graphene still maintained large diffusion
barriers of more than 1 eV. Therefore, we concluded that O-, Si-,
and P-doped graphene are suitable supports for Pt catalysts in a hydrogen
atmosphere.

1 Introduction
Recently,
metal subnanoclusters, which are composed of several
to tens of metal atoms, have attracted considerable attention for
various applications, such as catalysts and optical materials, thanks
to their unique property originating from confined electrons in molecular
dimensions and discrete energy levels.1 The properties of metal subnanoclusters vary greatly with their
size because the atomic and electronic structures of metal subnanoclusters
are highly dependent on the number of metal atoms. For instance, Imaoka
and co-workers showed that a Pt10 catalyst exhibited higher
catalytic activity for a hydrogenation reaction for styrene than Pt8, Pt9, and Pt nanoparticle catalysts2 and that a Pt19 catalyst exhibited
the highest catalytic activity for an oxygen reduction reaction among
various size-controlled Pt subnanoclusters and bulk Pt.3 Similar to the above examples, metal subnanoclusters
exhibit superb properties with specific size; it is thus critical
to maintain the size of metal subnanoclusters during operation for
their practical use. Thus, support materials that strongly interact
with metal subnanoclusters and suppress the detachment and diffusion
of metal subnanoclusters are required for their practical use. Additionally,
due to their very fine size, catalytic activities of metal subnanoclusters
also highly depend on the support materials.4 This indicates that properties of metal subnanoclusters can be tuned
by choosing a proper support through so-called “support effects”.

Graphene is considered a promising support for metal subnanoclusters
because of its high mechanical and chemical durability, relative surface
area, and electron conductivity. However, the planar structure and
delocalized π electrons of graphene hardly interact with adsorbates.
Therefore, the detachment, diffusion, and agglomeration of metal atoms
can easily occur,5 resulting in degradation
of the metal subnanoclusters. It has been reported that heteroatom
doping of graphene improves the durability of metal clusters on graphene.5 We previously investigated the effect of dopant
dependence on the adsorption states and diffusion behavior of metal
atoms, that is, Pt and Fe, and showed that dopant atoms improve the
interaction between a metal atom and graphene, preventing agglomeration
of metal subnanoclusters.6,7 As mentioned, properties
of metal subnanoclusters highly depend on support materials; therefore,
a large variety of heteroatom-doped graphene can give many options
for designing catalysts.

Atmospheric gas adsorption on metal
subnanocluster catalysts also
enhances the degradation. It has been reported that the activity of
a Pt subnanocluster catalyst on Ketjenblack gradually decreased in
a H2 environment, causing agglomeration and detachment
of the subnanocatalysts.2 Additionally,
it is well known that water gas changes the shape of Cu nanoclusters.
That is, the (111) and (100) surfaces dominantly surround the Cu nanoclusters,
whereas after water gas adsorbs on Cu nanoclusters, the ratios of
lower index surfaces such as (100) and (110) increase.8 In the field of hydrogen storage, it has been reported
that H atoms and H2 decrease the interaction between a
metal atom and carbon substrates, such as carbon nanotube and graphene.9,10 Therefore, even though heteroatom-doped graphene has been shown
to suppress the degradation of metal subnanoclusters in vacuum, atmospheric
gas adsorption may enhance the detachment, diffusion, and agglomeration
of metal subnanoclusters on heteroatom-doped graphene. However, dopant
dependence on the interaction between a metal atom and light-element-doped
graphene in atmospheric gas is still unclear. Thus, the adsorption
and diffusion properties of atmospheric gas adsorbed metal subnanoclusters
on heteroatom-doped graphene should be investigated to evaluate the
lifetime of catalysts under operating conditions.

In this study,
we considered adsorptions of H2 and H,
which are important substances for the hydrogenation of organic compounds
and oxygen reduction reactions, on a Pt atom supported on light-element-doped
graphene. As a first step, we adopted the Pt atom as a catalyst to
focus on the junction point between Pt subnanoclusters and heteroatom-doped
graphene. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional
theory (DFT), we investigated the adsorption states of H and H2 on Pt/heteroatom-doped graphene systems and the adsorption
and diffusion behaviors of PtH and PtH2 to identify suitable
dopants that would prevent detachment and agglomeration of Pt subnanoclusters
in the hydrogen atmosphere.

2 Computational Methods
We performed DFT calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP 5.4.1)11−14 and the projector-augmented wave method.15,16 We adopted the rev-vdW-DF217 exchange-correlation
functional. The rev-vdW-DF2 functional is composed of a revised Becke’s
exchange18 and the nonlocal correlation
of vdW-DF219 and accurately accounts for
the van der Waals interaction. The plane-wave basis set was used with
an energy cutoff of 600 eV. The supercell consisted of a periodically
repeated 4 × 4 graphene monolayer with a 25 Å vacuum layer.
For the heteroatom-doped graphene, we considered graphene in which
one of its C atoms is substituted by the heteroatom, as shown in Figure 1. The concentration
of the heteroatom was 3.1 at. %, which is a reasonable value identified
from previous experimental reports.20,21 To determine
the dependence of the Pt adsorption and diffusion properties on the
dopant used, we investigated six dopants (X), where X = B, N, O, Si,
P, and S. These light-element-doped graphene supports have been observed
in experiments.21−25 For comparison, we also considered monovacant graphene as a case
of strongly adsorbing supports. We adopted the optimized lattice parameters
of each graphene support and the most stable configurations of the
Pt/graphene systems reported in our previous study.6,7 We
used a 5 × 5 × 1 Γ-point centered Monkhorst–Pack
grid26 for Brillouin zone sampling to calculate
the total energy, with a Gaussian smearing σ of 0.2 eV. All
the atoms were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was less
than 0.02 eV/Å.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of 4 × 4 supercell of heteroatom-doped
graphene. The brown and blue balls denote C atoms and heteroatoms,
respectively.

In order to investigate
the hydrogen adsorption effects on Pt adsorption
states, we also introduced one H atom or H2 molecule in
the supercell. Figure 2 shows the initial adsorption sites of H and H2 on each
Pt/graphene system. For the H2 molecule, we considered
two directions of the molecular axis of the H2 molecule,
that is, perpendicular and parallel to the graphene basal plane, as
shown in Figure 3.
The initial distance between hydrogen adsorbates from a single Pt
atom was set to 2 Å. We defined the adsorption energies of H EadX(H) and H2EadX(H2) on Pt/X-doped graphene
using the following equations 1   2  where EX(Pt/gra), EX(PtH/gra), and EX(PtH2/gra) are the total energies
of Pt/, PtH/, and PtH2/X-doped graphene, respectively. EH2 is the total energy of isolated
H2.

The black points denote the position of the H atom and the center
of the H2 molecule axis. The brown, green, white, blue,
and silver balls represent C, B, N, Si, and Pt atoms, respectively.

of H2 molecule: (a) direction of axis of H2 molecule
perpendicular
to Pt atom and (b) direction of axis of H2 molecule parallel
to Pt atom.

To evaluate the effect
of adsorbed H and H2 on the interaction
between a single Pt atom and X-doped graphene, we also calculated
the adsorption energies of PtH EadX(PtH) and PtH2EadX(PtH2) on X-doped graphene as follows 3   4  where EX(gra), EPtH, and EPtH2 are the total energies of isolated X-doped
graphene, PtH, and PtH2, respectively.

We calculated
the diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 on pristine graphene
using a climbing image nudged elastic band
(CI-NEB) method.27,28 For heteroatom-doped graphene,
it has been reported that the potential energy change through diffusion
of a single Pt atom changes monotonically with the distance from the
dopants and that the diffusion barrier of a single Pt atom is nearly
identical to the adsorption energy differences between the corresponding
heteroatom-doped graphene and pristine graphene. Thus, we defined
the diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 on heteroatom-doped
graphene in this manner.

To compensate for the dipole–dipole
interaction between
graphene layers, a dipole moment correction was incorporated.29,30 We used Visualization for Electronic and Structure Analysis (VESTA)31 to visualize the atomic models and electron
density distributions.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Single Pt Atom Adsorption States on Heteroatom-Doped
Graphene
We revisited the adsorption states of a single Pt
atom on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene using the rev-vdW-DF2
functional. Figure 4 shows the most stable adsorption sites of the single Pt atom on
pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene. From Figure 4, a single Pt atom tends to adsorb on low
coordination sites such as top and bridge sites. We note that the
most stable adsorption configurations do not change whether the conventional
PBE functional or rev-vdW-DF2 was used. Figure 5 shows the adsorption energy of a single
Pt atom on pristine graphene and each heteroatom-doped graphene support.
We note that the adsorption energy of a single Pt atom on monovacant
graphene is −7.25 eV, which is almost identical to the previous
report.32 As shown in Figure 5, the Pt atom adsorbs more
stably on heteroatom-doped graphene than on pristine graphene. In
particular, O-, Si-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene exhibit
high adsorption energy of a single Pt atom. The adsorption energy
calculated using the rev-vdW-DF2 functional was approximately 0.3
eV larger than that calculated using the PBE functional.6 The energy difference corresponds to more than
10% of the corresponding adsorption energy in the cases of weak adsorbed
Pt/graphene, that is, pristine, B-doped, and N-doped graphene. However,
the chemical bonding behaviors determined using the PBE and rev-vdW-DF2
functionals correspond well to each other. Therefore, the origin of
the adsorption energy difference is the London dispersion interaction.

yellow, and silver balls represent C, B, N, O, Si, P, S, and Pt atoms,
respectively. The corresponding bonding distances between Pt and the
coordinated atoms are also shown.

Figure 5 Adsorption energies of a single Pt atom on pristine and B-, N-,
O-, Si-, P-, and S-doped graphene.

In Figure 6, the
electron density distributions are used to briefly explain why O-,
Si-, P-, and S-doped graphene exhibit high negative adsorption energies
for a Pt atom. Figure 6a–c shows that the Pt atom does not interact with the pristine,
B-doped, and N-doped graphene strongly because of the delocalized
π orbital of graphene. Thus, the pristine, B-doped, and N-doped
graphene exhibit low adsorption energy for the Pt atom. For O-doped
graphene, the valence number of the O atom is six; thus, one of the
C atoms near the O atom has a dangling bond. In addition, a Pt atom
also has a covalent bond with a C atom adjacent to an O atom, which
has an sp3-like orbital because of its bending structure
of C–C–O. Therefore, a Pt atom strongly bonds with O-doped
graphene. For Si-, P-, and S-doped graphene, Si, P, and S atoms protrude
from the basal graphene surface because the atomic radii of Si, P,
and S are much larger than the atomic radius of C. Therefore, there
is a dangling sp3 orbital around the Si, P, and S atoms
and Pt atom that can strongly bond with the Pt atom. We note that
the sp3 dangling bond orbitals are nearly unoccupied, half-filled,
and fully occupied in Si-, P-, and S-doped graphene, respectively.
Monovacant graphene shows the highest adsorption energy for a Pt atom
thanks to its dangling bonds of adjacent three C atoms. More details
about the adsorption states of a single Pt atom on pristine and heteroatom-doped
graphene are provided in our previous report.6

3.2 Effect
of H Atom on Pt Adsorption States on
Heteroatom-Doped Graphene
In this section, we focus on the
effect of H adsorption on Pt adsorption and the diffusion properties
on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene. First, we investigated
the most stable adsorption states of PtH on pristine and heteroatom-doped
graphene. Figure 7 shows
the adsorption energies of PtH and H atoms; the adsorption energies
of PtH are smaller than those of a single Pt atom. In particular,
the adsorption energies largely decrease with H adsorption for pristine,
O-doped, and S-doped graphene, where the decrease ratios are more
than 30%. In the case of monovacant graphene, the adsorption energies
of PtH and H atoms are −6.32 and – 2.87 eV, respectively.
These results indicate that H adsorption on a Pt atom weakens the
interaction between Pt atoms and the graphene support and enhances
the detachment of Pt catalysts. We note that the adsorption energies
of H atoms are larger than those of PtH except for the cases of O-doped
and monovacant graphene and, therefore, the detachment of PtH occurs
before H desorption. From the viewpoint of H adsorption energy, H
adsorption energy varies depending on the support material. Adsorbate
adsorption energies are crucial factors for catalytic reactions and
hydrogen storage materials. Thus, this may indicate that appropriate
combinations of the Pt atom and modified graphene realize both durability
and good performance for various applications.

Figure 7 Adsorption energies of
single Pt atoms (black) and Pt with H (red)
on pristine graphene and heteroatom-doped graphene and adsorption
energies of H atoms on Pt atom adsorbed on pristine and heteroatom-doped
graphene (blue).

Figure 8 shows the
most stable adsorption configurations of PtH on pristine and heteroatom-doped
graphene. Comparison of Figures 4 and 8 reveals that H adsorption
on Pt atoms increases the bond length between Pt atoms and pristine
and B-, N-, and S-doped graphene. For Si-doped graphene, Pt atoms
move to Si on-top sites after H adsorption because the H atom breaks
the bonding between a Pt atom and a C atom adjacent to a Si atom.
In addition, before H adsorption on a Pt atom on O-doped graphene,
the Pt atom strongly bonds with a C atom, as shown in Figure 6d. However, after H adsorption,
the bond length between Pt and C atoms increases, as shown in Figure 8d. This longer bond
length also indicates that H atoms decrease the interaction between
Pt atoms and the graphene support and enhance the detachment of Pt
catalysts.

(b) B-doped, (c) N-doped, (d) O-doped, (e) Si-doped, (f) P-doped,
(g) S-doped, and (h) monovacant graphene and of (i) isolated Pt with
H in vacuum. The brown, green, white, red, blue, purple, yellow, silver,
and pink balls represent C, B, N, O, Si, P, S, Pt, and H atoms, respectively.
The corresponding bonding distances between Pt and the coordinated
atoms are also shown.

Next, we discuss the interaction in PtH/X-doped graphene
systems. Figure 9 shows
the electron
density distributions around a Pt atom on pristine and each heteroatom-doped
graphene. For pristine graphene, comparison of Figures 6a and 9a reveals that
a Pt atom bonds with two C atoms through a covalent bond before H
adsorption; however, the electron density between Pt and one of the
C atoms decreased after H atom adsorption. However, the Pt atom bonds
with a H atom through a strong interaction, as observed in Figure 9a, which indicates
that the Pt atom prefers to bond with a H atom and break the interaction
with the C atom. To more precisely analyze the chemical bonding of
Pt/graphene systems, we also obtained the projected density of states
(PDOS), as shown in Figures S1a and S2a. In Figure S2a, a clear peak corresponding
to the covalent bond between Pt and H atoms is observed in the energy
range of −5 to −3 eV, and the peak corresponding to
the covalent bond between Pt and C2 in the energy range of −8
to −7 eV in Figure S1a disappears.
This result also indicates that one of two covalent bonds between
Pt and graphene is broken by H adsorption. This mechanism can be understood
as follows. The electron configuration of the Pt atom is [Xe]4f145d96s1, which indicates that the neutral
Pt atom has two unoccupied electron orbitals and can form covalent
bonds with at most two atoms. In addition, a Pt atom cannot form strong
covalent bonds with pristine graphene because of the delocalized π
electrons of graphene. Therefore, the Pt atom forms a strong Pt–H
covalent bond and a weak Pt–C covalent bond after H adsorption,
and the adsorption energy of PtH on pristine graphene greatly decreases.

Figure 9 Electron
density distributions around Pt atom on (a) pristine,
(b) B-doped, (c) N-doped, (d) O-doped, (e) Si-doped, (f) P-doped,
(g) S-doped, and (h) monovacant graphene. The inserted figures of
the atomic structures show the top and side views of each heteroatom-doped
graphene. The inserted figures of the side views show equal planes
showing the electron density distribution. The contour interval is
0.1 e/Å3.

For B-doped graphene, the electron density distribution between
the Pt atom B-doped graphene slightly decreases after H adsorption,
as observed in Figures 6b and 9b. For N-doped graphene, we observed
that the electron density distribution between the Pt atom and C2
atom, which is not adjacent to an N atom, decreases. These results
indicate that a H atom also weakens the interaction between a Pt atom
and B- and N-doped graphene, similar to the case for pristine graphene.
We note that the electron transfer from the C atom to a neighboring
N atom occurs because of the difference in electron negativity. Therefore,
a C atom adjacent to a N atom becomes an active site,33 and the reduction of the adsorption energy of Pt/N-doped
graphene is smaller than that of pristine graphene. We also determined
the PDOS of B- and N-doped graphene to further investigate the adsorption
states of a single Pt atom and PtH. As observed in Figure S1b,c, the peaks of the C atom of B-doped graphene
and C atoms of N-doped graphene are in energy ranges of −5
to −1 and – 9 to −3 eV, respectively. These peaks
can be assigned to bonding orbitals as peaks of Pt d orbitals in the
same energy range. As shown in Figure S2b,c, we observed that there are definitive peaks of covalent bonds between
Pt and H atoms in the energy range of −6 to −4 eV for
B-doped graphene and in the energy range of −5 to −3
eV for N-doped graphene. These electrons contributed to form covalent
bonds between Pt and graphene before H adsorption. These results indicate
that the Pt atom prefers to bond with a H atom, which results in the
weak interactions of Pt/B- and N-doped graphene. As previously mentioned,
the origin of these trends is the weak covalent bonds between Pt atoms
and B- and N-doped graphene, which have a planar structure. Therefore,
the H atom decreases the adsorption energy of the Pt atom on B- and
N-doped graphene.

For Si-doped graphene, as previously mentioned,
PtH adsorbs at
the top of the Si atom. This behavior is also observed because a Pt
atom prefers a strong covalent bond with a H atom instead of a weak
covalent bond with a C atom. Pt atoms form covalent bonds with Si-doped
graphene through the active sp3 dangling bond of Si atoms
after H adsorption. A clear peak of Pt dz2–Si
pz covalent bonds is observed in the energy range of −5
to −3 eV in the PDOS, as shown in Figure S2e. Therefore, the large adsorption energy of PtH on Si-doped
graphene is maintained after H adsorption, even though the Pt atom
loses the covalent bond with a C atom. For P-doped graphene, Figure 9f shows the large
electron density between Pt and P atoms, which indicates that PtH
and P atoms maintain strong interaction similar to the case of a single
Pt atom adsorption. Pt atoms form covalent bonds with P-doped graphene
through the active sp3 dangling bond of P atoms similar
to the case of Si-doped graphene. Clear peaks corresponding to the
covalent bonds of Pt dxy–H s orbitals and Pt dz2–P pz orbitals are observed
in the energy range of −6 to −5 eV in Figure S2f. Therefore, P-doped graphene also exhibits a large
adsorption energy of PtH.

For O- and S-doped graphene, the adsorption
energy of a Pt atom
decreases more than 30% through H adsorption, which is larger than
those of other heteroatom-doped graphene supports. For O-doped graphene,
a Pt atom forms a strong covalent bond with C atoms before H adsorption. Figure S2d shows that the antibonding orbital
of Pt–C adjacent to an O atom is partially occupied after H
adsorption, whereas the orbital lies just above the Fermi level before
H adsorption, as observed in Figure S1d. Therefore, the interaction between a Pt atom and O-doped graphene
weakens through H adsorption, resulting in a large reduction of the
adsorption energy. For S-doped graphene, the Pt d orbital is fully
occupied through a coordinate bond with the fully occupied sp3 orbital of a S atom before H adsorption. After H adsorption,
as previously mentioned, PtH only has one half-filled orbital, which
results in weakening of the coordinate bond between Pt and S atoms.
In addition, bonding and antibonding peaks between Pt and H atoms
are observed in energy ranges of −3 to −2 and –
1 to 0.5 eV, respectively, in Figure S2g. Because of the slight electron donation from the fully occupied
sp3 orbital of a S atom, the antibonding orbital of Pt–H
atoms is partially occupied, which results in weakening of the covalent
bond between Pt and H atoms. These findings indicate that the adsorption
energy of PtH is smaller than that of a single Pt atom.

For
monovacant graphene, the Pt atom keeps its high adsorption
energy after H adsorption because of strong interaction between the
Pt atom and monovacant graphene as shown in Figure 9h. Compared to Figures S1h and S2h, the PDOS of Pt and adjacent C atoms show only
slight changes through H adsorption, which means that H atoms do not
change the adsorption states of the Pt atom on monovacant graphene.
In addition, Figure S2h shows the PDOS
of an H atom on Pt/monovacant graphene does not show clear peaks indicating
Pt–H bonds. This shows that H atoms weakly interact with the
Pt atom on monovacant graphene because the Pt atom prefers forming
strong covalent bonds with dangling bonds in monovacant graphene.
Thus, PtH shows large adsorption energy on monovacant graphene.

3.3 Effect of H2 Molecule on Adsorption
States of a Pt Atom on Heteroatom-Doped Graphene
In this
section, we focus on the effect of H2 adsorption on the
adsorption states of a Pt atom on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene.
First, we investigated the most stable adsorption configuration and
corresponding adsorption energies of PtH2 and H2. Figure 10 shows
the adsorption energies of PtH2 and H2. The
adsorption energies of PtH2 on pristine and all the heteroatom-doped
graphene supports were smaller than those of a single Pt atom. In
the case of monovacant graphene, the adsorption energies of PtH2 and H2 are −4.77 and −0.14, respectively.
These findings indicate that H2 adsorption on a Pt atom
weakens the interaction between Pt and the graphene supports and enhances
the detachment of Pt catalysts. However, for O-, Si-, P-, S-doped,
and monovacant graphene, the adsorption energy of H2 was
smaller than that of PtH2, indicating that desorption of
the H2 molecule occurs preferentially compared with detachment
of Pt atoms. Therefore, O-, Si-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene
are promising supports for preventing the detachment of Pt subnanoclusters
in environments containing H2 molecules, whereas H2 adsorption enhances the degradation of Pt catalysts on pristine,
B-doped, and N-doped graphene. Similar to the case of H adsorption
on Pt atom, H2 adsorption energy varies depending on the
support material. Therefore, these results also indicate that appropriate
combinations of the Pt atom and modified graphene realize both durability
and good performance for various applications.

Figure 10 Adsorption energies
of single Pt atoms (black) and Pt with H2 molecule (red)
on pristine graphene and heteroatom-doped
graphene and adsorption energies of H2 molecules on Pt
atom adsorbed on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene (blue).

Figure 11 and Table 1 show the most stable
adsorption configuration of PtH2 and the bonding distances
of H2 on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene, respectively.
The results indicate that there are two types of H2 adsorption,
that is, molecular and dissociative adsorption, depending on the graphene
supports. For pristine and B-, N-, and Si-doped graphene, dissociative
adsorption after structural relaxation is observed, whereas molecular
adsorption is observed for the O-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene.
We note that the dissociative adsorption of H2 molecules
also occurs on an isolated Pt atom. Comparison of Figures 4 and 11 reveals that the dissociatively adsorbed H2 molecule
elongates the bond distance between Pt atoms and graphene except for
Si-doped graphene. For O-, P-, and S-doped graphene, spontaneous dissociation
of the H2 molecule does not occur; however, the intramolecular
bond distance of the H2 molecule is lengthened, as shown
in Table 1. We also
calculated the dissociative adsorption states of H2 on
Pt/O-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene using CI-NEB methods. Table 2 lists the adsorption
energies of PtH2 with H2 molecular and dissociative
adsorption. The adsorption energy of PtH2 with H2 dissociative adsorption is nearly identical to that with molecular
adsorption except for O-doped graphene. This means that whether dissociation
of H2 occurs on Pt/P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene
or not, the stabilities of a Pt atom on these graphene do not change
so much. In addition, Table 2 shows that the H2 dissociative adsorption states
on Pt/O-doped graphene are much unstable than that of H2 molecular adsorption states and the activation barrier of H2 dissociation on Pt/O-doped graphene is larger than the desorption
energy of a H2 molecule. These results indicate that detachment
of H2 preferentially occurs over H2 dissociation
on Pt/O-doped graphene. Therefore, we concluded that H2 molecularly adsorbs on Pt/O-doped graphene.

We investigated the detailed interaction between
PtH2 and the graphene support by examining the electron
density distribution
and PDOS. For pristine graphene, Figure 12a shows that the electron density between
Pt and C atoms is reduced by approximately 30% through the H2 adsorption. It can be considered that the Pt atom breaks the two
weak interactions between C atoms and forms two covalent bonds with
two H atoms, resulting in an electronic closed shell structure for
the same reason as for H atom adsorption. In the PDOS in Figure S3a, there is a distinctive peak corresponding
to covalent bonds between Pt and H atoms in the energy range of −6
to −4 eV and the peak corresponding to the covalent bond between
a Pt atom and pristine graphene is diminished. These results indicate
that a Pt atom forms covalent bonds with H atoms using the electrons
that have been contributed for Pt–C bonds. Therefore, the adsorption
energy of PtH2 greatly decreases compared with that of
a single Pt atom. For B- and N-doped graphene, Figure 12b–d shows that the electron density
between a Pt atom and B- and N-doped graphene is also reduced by approximately
40% through the H2 adsorption, which originates from the
electronic closed shell structure of PtH2 similar to the
case of pristine graphene. The PDOS in Figure S3b,c show that there is no peak of interaction between a Pt
atom and B- and N-doped graphene, whereas there are distinctive peaks
of Pt–H covalent bonds in the energy region of −5 to
−4 eV for both doped-graphene supports. Therefore, the H2 molecule also largely decreases the adsorption energy of
a Pt atom on B- and N-doped graphene.

a Pt atom with a H2 molecule, (i) P-doped graphene around
a Pt atom with a H2, (j) S-doped graphene around a Pt atom
with a H2 molecule, and (k) monovacant doped graphene around
a Pt atom with a H2 molecule. The contour interval is 0.1
e/Å3.

For Si-doped graphene, dissociative adsorption of the H2 molecule also occurs. Comparing Figures 6e and 12g, we observed
that although the H2 molecule decreases the electron density
between Pt and C atoms, the electron density between Pt and Si atoms
remains the same as the case without H2 adsorption. In Figure S3e, the corresponding clear peaks of
Pt dyz–H s and Pt dxy–Si pz bonds are observed in energy ranges of −6 to −5
and – 4 to −3 eV, respectively. However, the peak of
Pt–C covalent bonds is diminished. These results indicate that
H2 adsorption weakens the interaction between the Pt atom
and Si-doped graphene; however, the Pt atom still maintains the strong
interaction with the Si atom. This behavior occurs because the Si
atom has a nearly fully unoccupied electron orbital and PtH2 can adsorb on Si-doped graphene through the coordinate bond. Therefore,
Si-doped graphene exhibits a large adsorption energy of more than
2 eV in the H2 atmosphere.

Figure 12f,i–k
shows that a Pt atom on O-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene interacts
weakly with H2, whereas a high electron density is maintained
between a Pt atom and O-, P-, S-doped, and monovacant graphene. Comparing
the corresponding PDOS in Figures S1d,f,g and S3d,f,g, we observe that the peaks of the interaction between
a Pt atom and O- and P-doped graphene, which are in energy ranges
of −6 to −4 and – 5 to −3 eV, respectively,
become weaker than those without H2 adsorption and the
peaks of bonding between a Pt atom and H2 appear. For S-doped
graphene, no peaks assigned to Pt–S bonds are observed because
the PtH2 cannot accept the lone pair of S atoms. Therefore,
the adsorption energy of a Pt atom on S-doped graphene decreased more
than that on O- and P-doped graphene. As previously mentioned, the
Pt atoms on O-, P-, and S-doped graphene are close to having a closed
shell structure through the covalent and coordinate bonds, which leads
the Pt atoms to be inert. Therefore, H2 cannot dissociate
at the Pt atoms on O-, P-, and S-doped graphene.

For monovacant
graphene, the electron density distributions shown
in Figure 12k and
PDOS shown in Figure S3h show that a Pt
atom forms strong covalent bonds with monoatomic graphene even after
H2 adsorption and weak covalent bonds with H2. This is because the covalent bonds through the dangling bonds of
adjacent C atoms are very stable and a Pt atom prefers forming covalent
bonds with monovacant graphene. Thus, monovacant graphene shows large
adsorption energy of PtH2.

3.4 Effect
of H and H2 on Diffusion
Behavior of a Pt Atom on Heteroatom-Doped Graphene
Finally,
we discuss the diffusion behaviors of PtH and PtH2 on pristine
and heteroatom-doped graphene. Figure 13a,c shows the potential energy change through
diffusion of PtH and PtH2 on pristine graphene determined
using CI-NEB methods. We observed that H and H2 adsorptions
decrease the diffusion barrier of the Pt atom, whose value is less
than 0.07 eV, while the diffusion barrier of a single Pt atom on pristine
graphene is 0.15 eV. These results indicate that Pt subnanoclusters
on pristine graphene agglomerate rapidly in a hydrogen atmosphere
even at room temperature. Therefore, pristine graphene is not a suitable
support. Figure 13b,d shows the electron density distributions of PtH and PtH2 at the transition states, respectively. The Pt atoms have weak chemical
bonds with C atoms at the diffusion transition states, whereas the
interaction of Pt–H is strong. These trends do not change from
the most stable adsorption configurations, and therefore, smaller
adsorption energy with a relative increase of the significance of
van der Waals interactions results in the smaller potential corrugation.
We note that our previous reports6,7 also showed
that the diffusion barriers of metal atoms on graphene supports are
proportional to their adsorption energy of a metal atom. Thus, H atom
and H2 adsorption decrease the diffusion barrier of a Pt
atom. Figure 14 shows
the corresponding diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 on
each heteroatom-doped graphene. In the case of monovacant graphene,
the diffusion barriers of Pt, PtH, and PtH2 are 5.51, 5.25,
and 3.73 eV, respectively. The diffusion barriers of a Pt atom decreased
on all the graphene supports considered in this study because of the
larger decrease of the adsorption energy on heteroatom-doped graphene
caused by H and H2 adsorptions than that on pristine graphene.
However, O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene exhibited high
diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 of more than 1 eV. We
note that the corresponding Boltzmann factors of PtH2 diffusion
on O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene at 100 °C are 10–12 order smaller than the one on pristine graphene.
Therefore, from the viewpoints of the adsorption energy and diffusion
barrier, O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene are promising supports
for Pt subnanoclusters in a hydrogen atmosphere.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the effect of a H atom and H2 molecule on the adsorption states and diffusion behaviors
of a single Pt atom on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene using
first-principles calculations based on DFT. As a result, we revealed
that effects of H and H2 on Pt adsorption states on graphene
supports highly depend on the dopant species. We observed that heteroatom
doping of graphene increases the interaction between a Pt atom and
the graphene support. However, when a H atom or H2 molecule
adsorbs on a Pt atom, the interaction between the Pt atom and graphene
support is weakened because the Pt atom prefers to form covalent bonds
with H or H2 rather than with graphene. Therefore, H and
H2 adsorptions on the Pt atom weaken the interaction between
the Pt atom and graphene support and decrease the adsorption energy
of Pt atoms. We revealed that H2 adsorption on Pt atoms
decreases the adsorption energy of Pt atoms on all the graphene supports
studied by more than 30%, whereas H adsorption only affected the cases
of pristine, O-, and S-doped graphene. These results indicate that
the hydrogen atmosphere enhances detachment of Pt catalysts. However,
B-, O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene still maintained large
adsorption energies of PtH and PtH2 of more than 1.5 eV.
In addition, the diffusion barriers of PtH and PtH2 on
pristine graphene were calculated to be less than 0.07 eV, which indicates
that H and H2 enhance the diffusion and coarsening of Pt
catalysts. Even after H and H2 adsorptions on the Pt atom,
O-, Si-, P-doped, and monovacant graphene still maintained large diffusion
barriers of more than 1 eV. Therefore, from the viewpoints of the
adsorption energy and diffusion barrier, we concluded that O-, Si-,
P-doped, and monovacant graphene are suitable supports for Pt catalysts
in a hydrogen atmosphere. Additionally, we revealed that adsorption
energies of H and H2 vary depending on the dopant in graphene.
From these points, we believe that our findings can give many support
options for designing new catalysts.
