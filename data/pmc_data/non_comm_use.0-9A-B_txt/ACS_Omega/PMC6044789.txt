Bacterial adenosine
5’-diphosphate-ribosylating toxins are
encoded by several human pathogens, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (exotoxin A (ETA)), Corynebacterium
diphtheriae (diphtheria toxin (DT)), and Vibrio cholerae (cholix toxin (CT)). The toxins modify
eukaryotic elongation factor 2, an essential human enzyme in protein
synthesis, thereby causing cell death. Targeting external virulence
factors, such as the above toxins, is a promising alternative for
developing new antibiotics, while at the same time avoiding drug resistance.
This study aims to establish a reliable computational methodology
to find a “silver bullet” able to target all three toxins.
Herein, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the active sites
of ETA, DT, and CT, followed by the determination of the most appropriate
selection of the size of the docking sphere. Thereafter, we tested
two different approaches for normalizing the docking scores and used
these to verify the best target (toxin) for each ligand. The results
indicate that the methodology is suitable for identifying selective
as well as multitoxin inhibitors, further validating the robustness
of inverse docking for target-fishing experiments.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance
is a growing public-health threat,1 making
regression to a preantibiotic era in which
common infections could kill a very real possibility that we have
to address.2−4 Traditional antibacterial agents aim to kill bacteria
(bactericidal) or stop their growth (bacteriostatic) and provide an
incentive for the bacteria to develop resistance toward them using
different mechanisms. Thus, compounds that do not target the genome
or metabolic proteins inside the pathogens but act by inhibiting their
external virulence factors are an interesting alternative.

The
bacterial genus Pseudomonas includes a variety of Gram-negative,
rod-shaped, and polar-flagella species. A well-known opportunistic
pathogen of this genus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most commonly affects immunocompromised patients, such as those
with cystic fibrosis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and cancer,
or burn victims5,6 and is the major cause of infections
among hospitalized patients, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia and
bloodstream and urinary tract infections. P. aeruginosa is able to produce several toxic proteins that can kill the host
cell and is well known for its resistance to many major classes of
antibiotics.7−10

In P. aeruginosa, the most
toxic
factor secreted is exotoxin A (ETA). ETA has an LD50 (50%
of the lethal dose) of 0.2 μg/kg upon intraperitoneal injection
into mice.11−15 Once ETA has entered a eukaryotic cell through receptor-mediated
endocytosis, it catalyzes adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation
of its target protein, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2).16 eEF2 is a GTPase that operates during protein
synthesis to facilitate the movement of the peptidyl tRNA–mRNA
complex from site A to site P of the ribosome, a process known as
translocation.17 eEF2 contains a unique
post-translationally modified histidine residue, that is, diphthamide(2-[3-carboxyamido-3-trimethylamonio)propyl]histidine.18 The precise role of diphthamide remains undetermined,19 but its absence has been associated with altered
translational fidelity.20−22 Diphthamide is also the unique
site of modification of eEF2 by ETA and other NAD+-dependent
ADP ribosylase toxins, including Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin (DT) and Vibrio cholerae cholix toxin (CT).18,23,24

The modification involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety
from NAD+ to a nitrogen atom of the diphthamide imidazole
ring in eEF225−31 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Proposed mechanism
of diphthamide modification, catalyzed by ETA,
DT, and CT.

ADP ribosylation of eEF2
inhibits the translocation step in protein
synthesis, irreversibly inactivating eEF2 and leading to cell death.15,25,32−34

DT was
discovered in 188835 and is a
single-chain enzyme of 58 kDa with 535 amino acid residues. The toxin
has two subunits, the active or catalytic (A) domain and the binding
(B) domain, which displays both receptor-binding and translocation
capabilities.15,36,37 ETA is an AB toxin of 66 kDa, with 613 amino acids, discovered in
1966.14 CT is a 666-residue protein that
has an AB domain organization similar to that of ETA,23 and it was discovered as recently as in 2007.38 All three contain a HYYE motif in the active
site of the A domain, the latter of these (Glu) being identified as
the key catalytic residue, being invariant in all ADP-ribosylating
toxins.23,39−45 As proposed for Glu148 in DT, Glu553 in ETA, and Glu581 in CT, the
glutamic acid is believed to stabilize the oxacarbenium intermediate
after dissociation of nicotinamide by formation of a hydrogen bond
with the 2′-OH of the ribose.30,46 The catalytic
His is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the adenine ribose of
NAD+. Mutation of the His residue considerably reduces
the activity of the toxin.43,44,46−48

Finally, the two Tyr residues are part of a
hydrophobic pocket
that binds the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ through a π-stacking
interaction.42,47,49

Knowing that all three pathogens utilize closely related toxins
triggered the idea of developing new potential antibiotics targeting
mainly ETA but at the same time displaying activity against DT and
CT.

Paul Ehrlich connected chemistry with biology, postulating
the
existence of specific receptors for binding molecules.50,51 This idea evolves into the “magic bullet” concept,
that is, that is the concept of drugs going directly to their predetermined
biological target.52 However, this one-compound–one-target
picture is a simplification of the reality, where a one-compound–multiple-target
model is more appropriate. Thus, the “magic shotgun”
or “silver bullet” approach for drug development appears
to be more suitable and closer to reality than the magic bullet concept.53−55

To find the “magic shotgun” that is able to
target
several receptors with one load, inverse-docking approaches have emerged
as the in silico prototypical techniques to accomplish that goal.
Inverse docking refers to computational docking of a selected small
molecule onto a library of receptor structures, originally proposed
by Chen and Zhi in 2001.56 Since then,
several reports employing inverse-docking approaches for identifying
new potential targets have been published.57−61

In this work, we first selected a set of known
binders for each
of the three bacterial toxins and then performed, for the first time,
an inverse-docking study against all three. First, we analyzed the
active sites, found the optimal sizes of selected spheres for docking,
and “normalized” the binding energies to enable comparisons
and detect the best receptor for each ligand. Thereafter, we compared
the binding modes and affinities of the known ligands, such as NAD+, to validate the approach.

Results and Discussion
Comparison
of Toxins
The prepared models of all three
toxins were aligned and superposed in MOE 2015.10,62 and the sequence similarity and identity percentages of
DT and CT with respect to those of ETA were calculated (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Sequence alignment and
analysis of ETA (1AER), DT (1DTP), and CT (2Q6M). Sequence similarity and identity were
calculated with respect to those of ETA. Positive (blue) bars show
similarity and negative (red) bars represent dissimilar residues,
as obtained using BLOSUM62 matrix scores. The %-identity was also
calculated with respect to that of ETA and is displayed as magenta
bars. Identical residues are highlighted in green, whereas red residues
show nonidentical amino acids.

The primary structure of CT shows a 39.2% sequence identity
with
that of ETA for the catalytic domain, whereas DT displays an 18.4%
sequence identity. The sequence similarity to that of ETA is also
higher for CT (52.8%) as compared to that for DT (31.6%).

Those
residues that are described as interacting with the natural
substrate (NAD+) and are involved in the catalysis are
conserved in all three toxins (HYYE motif, see below) and are highlighted
with yellow arrows in Figure 2. Position 42 (arbitrary numbering for alignment) harbors
the catalytic His (440 for ETA, 21 for DT, and 460 for CT), which
is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the adenine ribose of NAD+. In alignment positions 75 and 86, two almost-parallel Tyr
residues are located (470 and 481 for ETA, 54 and 65 for DT, and 493
and 504 for CT, respectively). Finally, the Glu that is located at
position 180 is universally conserved among ADP ribosylases (553 for
ETA, 148 for DT, and 581 for CT) and has been described as essential
for catalytic activity.15,38,39 It forms a hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH of the ribose of
NAD+, stabilizing the oxacarbenium intermediate after the
first step of the SN1 dissociation of the nicotinamide
moiety (see Figure 1).30,40,46

Besides
the sequence similarity, the three-dimensional (3D) structures
of ADP ribosylases are also similar, as shown in Figure 3. Of particular interest is
that the residues belonging to the HYYE motif are not only conserved
but also have the same chain conformation among all structures.

DT in green, and CT in yellow. Residues belonging to the HYYE motif
are represented using a ball and stick model. (b) Root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) matrix values of the positions of the Cα atoms
for each pair of toxins. 1AER: ETA, 1DTP: DT, 2Q6M: CT.

As evidenced by the RMSD calculation
after alignment and superposition, ETA is more similar to CT than
to DT. This is also in line with the higher sequence identity and
similarity noted for these toxins (cf. Figure 1). It is clear that all three toxins share
common features in the active site, which could enable the possibility
of finding a potential multitarget inhibitor. Figure 4 shows the molecular surface of the active
site of ETA (1AER), calculated using MOE 2015.10.62 An
interaction-potential map, as displayed in Figure 4, provides a representation of where a chemical
probe has favorable interactions with a particular receptor. In this
context, a “probe” is a united-atom representation of
a particular functional group. Different probes were employed to calculate
the hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic energies at each grid point.63,64 The available probes include a range of different sizes, charges,
and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor properties, such as aromatic CH groups,
methyl groups, nitrogen atoms with a lone pair, amide NH and NH2 groups, protonated amine groups (both sp2 and
sp3), ether and ester oxygen atoms, carbonyl and carboxylic
oxygen atoms, halogen atoms, phosphate groups, water, alkaline ions,
and hydroxyl groups (phenolic and alcoholic). As can be seen, hydrophobic
contacts are formed where the two Tyr residues and His440 aromatic
ring are located. Hydrophilic contacts or solvent-exposed regions
occur preferably in the proximity of Glu553.

important amino acid residue (HYYE motif). (b) Surface representation

regions.

Optimization of Docking
Parameters
It is well known
that one of the critical parameters for proper ligand docking is the
size of the box used to search for and identify the lowest-energy
binding pose of the ligand.65 The ultimate
goal of molecular docking is to predict the correct ligand–receptor
interactions, that is, the binding pose, and to determine the binding
affinity from that pose. When ligands are drug candidates, compound
ranking is the most important task. To obtain as accurate a compound
ranking and thus screening results and identification of lead candidates
as possible, optimum pose prediction is imperative. This in turn requires
a correct docking contact sphere size, that is, the actual active
site description used in the docking calculations.

Therefore,
we first investigated how the size of the grid affects the accuracy
of posing a ligand within the search space (the active site). To this
end, known ligands with available crystal structures of the corresponding
complexes (Table S1 and Figure S1, Supporting
Information) were compared to the complexes obtained from docking
studies using box sizes of 8 and 6 Å, respectively, and selecting
spheres within those radii. First, the molecular surface of the receptor
was generated,66 followed by spheres capturing
the topology of the surface.67 These overlapping
spheres are used to create a negative image of the surface pocket
of the target and are selected within some radius, for example, 8
and 6 Å (Figure S2). As the final
grid is generated using the spheres, the sphere centers are matched
with the ligand atoms during docking to generate the orientations
of the ligand in the active site. Too small a search space (very small
radius or number of spheres) may give an incomplete set of conformations,
and an excessively large search space may produce a large number of
inappropriate binding poses. To this end, benchmarking of molecular
docking was performed using two different radii for selecting spheres
for each known ligand within its receptor, aiming to maximize the
docking accuracy.

For NAD+, the crystal structure
of the CT complex was
employed (3Q9O). When using an 8 Å radius for selecting spheres, the predicted
docked pose was flipped compared with the crystal structure, meaning
that the nicotinamide moiety was placed in the region of the adenine
ring in the crystal structure and vice versa (Figure 5a). The computed RMSD of the heavy atoms
for NAD+ with respect to that for the crystal structure
was 9.72, calculated using the Schrödinger graphical interface
Maestro.68 On the contrary, when using
a smaller sphere-selecting radius (6 Å), the predicted binding
pose for NAD+ was highly improved (Figure 5b), also evidenced by an RMSD of 1.90.

Figure 5 Predicted binding
poses for NAD+ in CT are displayed
in blue, and the crystal structure conformation is represented in
red. (a) Sphere-selecting radius of 8 Å and (b) sphere-selecting
radius of 6 Å.

The existence of these
two possibilities is coherent with the shape
and features of NAD+, having aromatic, hydrophobic residues
(nicotinamide and adenine) at the termini and hydrophilic groups (ribose
rings and phosphates) in between, and makes the reproducibility of
experimental information increasingly important in order to serve
as a suitable screening setup.44 The interactions
for CT and NAD+ are shown in Figure S3 for both the crystal structure and docked conformation.
Hence, the pose (conformation and orientation) was accurately reproduced.

The other 10 known complexes for CT, included in Table S1, were also evaluated using sphere-selecting radii
of 8 and 6 Å. In all cases, the best pose prediction was obtained
for a 6 Å radius, which was thus the selected docking parameter
for further studies. The computed RMSD of the heavy atoms for these
10 ligands docked to CT with respect to that of the crystal structure
is reported in Table S2.

For ETA,
both β-TAD and PJ34 were computationally docked
using both sphere radii selections. For β-TAD, the results are
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Predicted
binding poses for β-TAD in ETA are displayed in
blue, and the crystal structure conformation is represented in red.
(a) Sphere-selecting radius of 8 Å and (b) sphere-selecting radius
of 6 Å.

Although the pose is
not flipped when using an 8 Å selecting
radius, as in the above-mentioned case, the predicted docked conformation
is rotated (Figure 6a), probably hampering important hydrophobic interactions with the
two Tyr residues belonging to the HYYE motif (RMSD 3.28). Again, using
a 6 Å radius, the docked pose was significantly improved, also
evidenced by a computed RMSD of 1.74 (Figure 6b). For PJ34, using an 8 Å radius again
generated a pose with a larger RMSD with respect to that of the crystal
structure than that obtained when using a 6 Å radius (6.12 and
3.86, respectively).

Finally for DT, APU was tested as the ligand
for binding-pose reproduction,
and the results are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Predicted binding poses for APU in DT are displayed in
blue, and
the crystal structure conformation is represented in red. (a) Sphere-selecting
radius of 8 Å and (b) sphere-selecting radius of 6 Å.

As for β-TAD, using an 8
Å radius generated a rotated
pose for APU with respect to that of the crystal structure (RMSD 2.56),
whereas the predicted pose when using a 6 Å radius perfectly
reproduced the orientation observed in the crystal structure (RMSD
0.42).

These benchmarking calculations using ligands with known
crystal
structures of the corresponding complexes assisted in defining the
optimum docking parameters, aimed at improving the accuracy of the
virtual screening protocol. In particular, for ETA, DT, and CT, it
was found that on using a 6 Å radius for selecting docking spheres,
the docking poses for known ligands are well-reproduced.

Inverse Docking
of Known Binders
After benchmarking
the systems to reproduce the docking poses with a set of small molecules
against the toxin library, the next step was to estimate the relative
affinity of those ligands toward each receptor.

The scoring
functions used in the docking programs are useful to compare the different
ligands for the same receptor (normal or “forward” docking),
but they cannot be directly used to compare one ligand interacting
with different receptors (inverse docking) because these in general
do not have the same binding pocket shape, protein size, or internal
energy. These factors can increase or decrease the docking scores
across the targets for all ligands, for example, a deeper binding
pocket may lead to larger binding affinities for all ligands and hence
a wrong conclusion if this then leads to the selection of that particular
target as the “best receptor”.69

Therefore, to prioritize targets for a particular ligand,
a post-docking
analysis in the form of a normalization or standardization to correct
for such biases must be performed.

A normalization of the energy
values was suggested by Lauro et
al.,70,71 using eq 1, where V is the normalized score
for a potential ligand on a receptor, V0 is the predicted docking score obtained in the molecular docking
calculation, ML is the average binding
energy of the ligand across different targets, and MR is the average binding energy of the receptor for all
ligands studied (all entries in kcal mol–1) (Table 1). 1  V is an
absolute number that
only shows that the higher the value, the more promising is the interaction
between a particular ligand and a target from the panel of toxins.
To confirm the validity of the approach, a comparison of the results
for some ligands with known binding preferences can be performed (bold
entries in Table 1).
For instance, it has been described that the affinity of ADP-ribosylating
toxins for NAD+ follows the trend DT > ETA ≥
CT.44,72 For PJ34, the known affinity for CT is higher
than that observed
for ETA.38 Finally, for β-TAD a higher
affinity for ETA is expected.46

a MR and ML are the average values
used for the calculation
of the normalized values, V (cf. eq 1). Bold values in the Table correspond
to the ligands with known binding preferences against the toxins.

From Table 1, it
is clear that the normalization approach correctly identified the
target of choice for the selected known ligands. However, the span
of V values is rather small, thus making it difficult
to perform accurate selection. Also, the method is highly dependent
on the particular set of molecules included, affecting MR. Therefore, even if the trends are correct using the
Lauro normalization, a different approach might lead to more readily
interpretable results.

A different correction scheme from that
used above is the so-called
multiple active site correction (MASC), suggested by Vigers and Rizzi,73 shown in the following equations (eqs 2–4) 2   3   4  where Sij is the
original calculated docking score for the ith compound
and jth pocket (in kcal mol–1)
and Sij′ is the modified score
for compound i in active site j.
μi and σi are the average and standard deviations of the scores for
compound i across all pockets j,
respectively (Table 2).

a μ and σ
are the average
and standard deviations used for the calculation of the normalized
values, Sij′ (eqs 2–4). Bold values
in the Table correspond to the ligands with known binding preferences
against the toxins.

The
MASC score is useful in that it includes in the sign information
about how far apart a value is from the average and in which direction.
In this particular application, if an MASC score is negative, it means
that the score for the ligand in that particular receptor is better
(more negative) than the average among all targets. Again, the trends
for the known binders were accurately reproduced, for example, NAD+ scored negatively for ETA and DT (higher affinity), whereas
the MASC score for CT was positive (lower affinity). For PJ34, CT
stands out as the best binding target, and for β-TAD, it is
ETA, in accord with the experimental data. Thus, our inverse-docking
calculations on ADP-ribosylating toxins against known ligands allowed
for a clear identification of the target of choice.

The results
show that the MASC score works well when calculated
for a set of known ligands and suggest that the methodology can be
used to predict, on one hand the “best receptor” for
a particular potential ligand and, on the other hand a multitarget
compound if all receptors obtain similar MASC scores.

Conclusions
This study was undertaken to find the best docking settings to
perform an inverse-docking study on three different ADP-ribosylating
toxins. First, we compared the active sites of ETA, DT, and CT and
found the optimum docking box size for reproducing binding poses of
the natural substrate (NAD+) and 13 other ligands with
available crystal structures. In addition, we carried out molecular
docking experiments against all three toxins and tested two different
corrections of the scoring functions aimed at target-fishing the best
receptor for each ligand.

We have constructed a ready-for-dock
toxin library, prepared to
run inverse virtual screening with different databases to identify
inhibitor candidates for all toxins. Hence, these results could serve
as the starting point for developing potential antibiotics targeting
three different toxins from harmful pathogens, that is, P. aeruginosa, C. diphtheriae, and V. cholerae. As the receptors
are available and prepared, any small-molecule database can be employed
for inverse-docking studies, using the MASC score to detect potential
selective or multitarget ligands.

However, we emphasize that
the scheme presented herein is completely
general. After setting up and benchmarking a set of target receptors,
be it a family of related proteins, such as kinases, or a wide set
of diverse receptors where binding may result in adverse side effects,
screening and MASC normalization will enable the user to identify
selective as well as broad-hitting binders.

Methodology
Protein Preparation
The protein crystal structures
of ETA (PDB id 1AER(46)), DT (PDB id 1DTP(74)), and CT (PDB id 2Q6M(38)) were retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank.75

All molecular
modelings were performed using the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF) DOCK (version 6.7).76,77 Structure preparation
prior to docking was performed using UCSF Chimera.78

Each protein structure was processed according to
the usual recommended
protocol in DOCK.77 Ligands were removed
and the “Dock prep” Chimera tool was
employed. Hydrogen atoms were added to generate the protonation states
at physiological pH. Charges for standard residues were calculated
from Amber ff14SB,79 and histidine side
chains were protonated according to their local environment. The molecular
surface for each structure was calculated using the chimera tool “DMS”.
The corresponding box was created using the program “showbox”,
and the final grid was calculated using the “grid” program
suite, both included in DOCK. The sizes of the grid and selected spheres
were carefully selected in order to reproduce the structures and poses
of known crystallized ligands (see the Results and
Discussion section).

Ligand Selection and Preparation
The 3D structure of
the natural substrate, NAD+, was determined from the CT–NAD+ complex (PDB id 3Q9O(44)), whereas the structure
of an analogue of the natural substrate, β-TAD, was obtained
from the complex with ETA (PDB id 1AER(46)). Several
inhibitors were also retrieved from the crystal structures of their
corresponding toxin complexes: PJ34 (PDB id 1XK9(80)), APU (PDB id 1DTP(74)), 1,8-naphthalimide (PDB
id 3ESS(81)), V30 (PDB id 3NY6(82)), GPD (PDB
id 3KI0(82)), GPF (PDB id 3KI1(82)), GPG (PDB
id 3KI2(82)), GPH (PDB id 3KI3(82)), GPP (PDB
id 3KI4(82)), GPM (PDB id 3KI5(82)), GPL (PDB
id 3KI6(82)), and GPI (PDB id 3KI7(82)) (Table S1 and Figure S1). For all ligands, protonation
states at pH 7 were assigned using the chimera tool “AddH”
and charges were assigned based on AM1-BCC calculations (“Add
Charge” Chimera tool).

Molecular Docking
A grid-based scoring function was
used for docking, considering each receptor as rigid and sampling
ligand torsion angles during energy-minimization procedures.83,84 A maximum of 500 orientations were sampled for each ligand, they
were energy-minimized (score optimization), and the top scored pose
was then kept. The scores corresponding to each protein for a single
ligand were saved for further analysis. Two normalization or standardization
approaches were implemented to enable the comparison among docking
scores from different receptors (see the Results
and Discussion section).
