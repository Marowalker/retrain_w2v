The recent technological
advances combined with the development
of new concepts and strategies have revolutionized the field of sensor
devices, allowing access to increasingly sophisticated device structures
associated with high sensitivities and selectivities. Among them,
electrochemical and electrical sensors have gained the most interest
because they offer unique intrinsic characteristics and meet the requirements
to be integrated in more sophisticated devices including microfluidics
or lab-on-chips, opening access to multiplex and all-in-one detection
devices. In the present article, we outline and provide a short and
concise overview on the most recent achievements in the field of electrical
detection of ionic species as they display versatile roles in many
important biological events and are ubiquitous in environment.

1 Introduction
The introduction of microfabrication
techniques1 into the field of analytical
sensors has recently led to
tremendous development of microfabricated devices notably for monitoring
hazardous and/or harmful analyte traces. These devices are not only
designed and suitable for environmental purposes but also of great
importance to directly assess biological samples in the field of in vitro or in vivo diagnostics and food
processing.2 Among the myriad of analytes,
ionic species represent one of the largest foreseen targets. Indeed,
ions and polyionic structures are ubiquitous in environment (water,
soil, etc.) and display versatile roles in many important biological
processes and cellular events (enzymatic reactions, antigen–antibody
recognition, DNA hybridization, neuronal transmission, etc.).3 However, although they are beneficial in many
life processes, their possible disruptions may cause adverse effects
on human health and could generate environmental alterations.

Conventional analytical methods reported in the identification
and quantification of ionic or polyionic species are mainly based
on spectroscopic techniques such as inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectroscopy (ICP-MS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), as well
as ion chromatography coupled with conductivity detection (IC-CD),
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS and LC
MS/MS), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC and
GC-MS), or capillary electrophoresis (CE) affording precise and accurate
measurements.4 These techniques require
expensive and sophisticated instrumentation, complicated sample preparation,
and expert manpower and are occasionally inappropriate. They are also
somewhat tedious and time-consuming. To meet these drawbacks, scientists
have strived to endeavor efficient methods and devices for the rapid
and sensitive analysis of ionic pollutants based on microfabricated
sensors. To this end, nanotechnologies combining chemistry, physics,
electronics, and biology have appeared to be of great interest in
the development of sensing electrochemical devices as they offer unique
characteristics such as miniaturization, low cost, ease-of-use, specificity,
selectivity, and real-time monitoring capabilities at the point-of-need
compared to other technologies based on optical (surface plasmon resonance,
fluorescence, and absorption), mass (piezo- or magnetoelectric), and
thermometrics as output signal transducers.

The objective of
the present article is to provide a short and
concise overview on recent achievements in the field of electrical
detection of ionic species. We believe that those technologies will
have a breadth and deep impact in the forthcoming years due to the
perpetual demand of point-of-care and wearable sensing devices as
well as their implementation and integration in more sophisticated
devices including microfluidics and lab-on-chips for theranostic applications.

2 General Considerations
2.1 Sensor Specifications
The recognition
process constitutes the key step in sensing devices and depends strongly
on both the analyte morphology (shape, geometry, size, etc.) and the
bonds established within the receptor (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic,
π–π interactions, etc.). However, other specifications,
which can affect the recognition process, have to be taken into account
and not be neglected such as the nature and type of the analyte (neutral,
zwitterionic, ionic, or polyionic species), the complexity of the
medium (solution, gas, biofluids, etc.), the temperature, the pH,
the presence of putative inteferents, and more. Besides, major challenges
need to be solved upon device operation in order to (i) prevent the
molecular damage; (ii) enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, the sensitivity,
and the selectivity; (iii) improve the repeatability, reliability,
and accuracy; (iv) optimize the reversibility, the linearity, and
response time; and (v) preserve the storage and operational stability
(drift) to increase the device lifetime.

2.2 Sensor
Performance Characteristics
Regardless of the configuration
of the sensor devices, the realization
of efficient and robust sensors is combined with the fabrication of
flawless surfaces, embedding the appealed receptors, analogously to
cellular membranes, to ensure high performance. Therefore, the assemblage
and operation of an electrochemical sensor require the formation either
of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or even more complex structures,
encompassed with conducting polymers, carbon and noncarbon nanomaterials,
polymers, covalent or metal–organic frameworks, composites,
etc., at the surface of a metallic electrode or organic substrate
as well as organic–inorganic hybrid that could be, but not
exclusively, a semiconductor or a metallic oxide. Thus, suitable ultrathin
organic films tethering or embedding the desired synthetic or natural
receptors that solely bind to the analyte of interest are critical.
These thin films not only serve to graft the (bio)receptors to the
device surface but also play a crucial role in enhancing signal-to-noise
ratio and sensitivity.5 Furthermore, the
modified surfaces act as specific barriers and help to abate the ion
diffusion, reduce the nonspecific adsorption and fouling, and ensure
the biocompatibility for medical purposes. The sensor performances
are based not only on the unique combination of the (bio)receptor,
the surface chemistry, and methods used to achieve such functionalization
but also on the structure, geometry, and configuration of the sensor
device. Moreover, regarding specifically the bioreceptors (antibodies,
DNA, enzymes, etc.) that are delicate molecules associated with a
horrible environmental profile in the nonphysiological conditions
pH/temperature/organic solvents, their conformation and structural
integrity need to be preserved during all the fabrication steps and
device operation in order to improve the sensor lifetime. Therefore,
the whole key parameters need to be carefully checked and characterized
at each step (physically, chemically, spectroscopically, and electrically)
in order to ensure the successful integration of the receptor, the
optimal surface modification achieving the best device implementation
and fabrication. A nonexhaustive list includes the effect of the surface
orientation and morphology, the interface properties, the (bio)receptor
itself (nature, structure), the surface energy (contact angle goniometry),
the thickness, the deposition methods and deposition parameters (solution
or vacuum deposition processes), the post- and pretreatments, and
so on. These are some of the controllable parameters of vital importance
to achieve the best sensor devices.

The aforementioned receptor
can be either a natural, synthetic, or bioinspired molecule, which
can detect a wide variety of ionic and polyionic species on the basis
of its structure. Those include heavy metals, anions, complex molecules
or bioactive molecules,6 cells, tissues,7 and organisms (bacteria, viruses). The transduction
of an input signal into an electrical output signal can be achieved
by amperometry, voltammetry, conductometry (dynamic techniques), or
potentiometry (at equilibrium without current flow) connected or not
to amplifiers. Depending on the structure of the sensor devices, direct
(generation of electroactive species, variation of the conductance)
or indirect (biorecognition event or a mediated-process electrode)
measurements can be achieved. In addition, nanotechnology contribution
allowed the possibility to nanoscale-down the size of the sensor devices,
giving rise to their implementation and integration in more sophisticated
devices such as microfluidics and lab-on-chips.

3 Microfabricated Electrochemical Sensors
Electrochemical
sensors comprise a wide variety of techniques applicable
to the field in which two- or three-electrode devices are usually
employed. Among others, one can cite potentiometry, amperometry,16 cyclic voltammetry,16,18 chronocoulometry–amperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS),12 electrochemical quartz crystal
microbalance, electrochemical surface plasmon resonance, scanning
electrochemical microscopy, and combined electrochemistry with AFM
or waveguide-based techniques.9 Besides,
nanotechnologies have dramatically contributed to the miniaturization
of these types of sensor devices, allowing the possibility to generate
highly sophisticated devices. They present the advantage to display
higher sensitivity notably respective to biomolecule detection due
to reduced analysis volumes and high electrode surface areas.

3.1 Sensing Biological Anionic Targets
In this context,
carbon-based materials (CMs), graphene (2D), carbon
nanotubes (1D), graphene oxide (GO) or its reduced form (rGO), fullerene
(OD), graphite (3D),14,19 and related structures represent
certainly one of the pre-eminent classes of applied materials.10 Indeed, besides their intrinsic optical or electrical
properties, they present the benefits to boost the electrocatalytic
effect and exhibit higher stability and resistance to passivation.
They have been used in conjunction with a wide variety of biomolecules
(nucleic acids, aptamers, enzymes, and peptides) for the realization
of specific biosensors.8 The high demand
of biological targets, typically for medical purposes, such as proteins,
bacteria, cells, and more particularly DNA/RNA sequences, has largely
driven the development of new microchip sensor fabrication and techniques.
Indeed, the ability of sensing a specific DNA/RNA sequence in a biological
sample allows the rapid diagnostic of numerous diseases, making these
specific analytes the most promising targets in the area of research
of lab-on-chip detectors. Generally speaking, DNA microarrays are
used for sequence-specific detection; it consists of a DNA biosensor
where specific DNA strands are immobilized on a solid support in a
“DNA spot” used to detect hybridization with the complementary
sequence. An indirect reading of the detection is readily obtained
by using either fluorescent dye or labeled primers. In certain cases,
the detection process is coupled at the upstream to a specific treatment
of the sample such as preconcentration (isotachophoresis, ITP), extraction,
or amplification (PCR) techniques affording an improvement of the
limit of detection (LOD). In this regard, Saliman et al.11 have recently developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical
DNA sensor based on the subtle combination of hollow carbon spheres
(HCSs) with a conducting organic polymer (polyaniline, PANI) to achieve
the detection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Figure 1).

detection of HBV
DNA biomarkers by a DPV technique. (Reprinted with permission from

material excerpted should be directed to the American Chemical Society).

The association of carbon-based structures with
PANI permits us
to improve the figures of merit, both stability and electron transfer
rate, of such conducting polymers in biological samples. The postfunctionalization
of the nanocomposite electrode with a specific probe improves the
selectivity toward the analyte. To this aim, HCS-PANI nanostructures
have been functionalized with a specific probe of the HBV DNA marker.
In order to ensure the grafting of the probe onto the nanocomposite,
an electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles was previously made. Evaluation
of the selectivity was performed using noncomplementary or mutant
strands revealing the highest affinity to the HBV DNA. Thereby, a
limit of detection of 3.62 fM (i.e. ≈109 DNA/mL)
by the DPV technique is attained, and it has been proven that it can
be used in real samples. Finally, repeatability and reproducibility
were performed leading to a relative standard deviation of 1.37%.

Noncarbon materials (NCMs) owing their optical, electrical, or
magnetic properties have also been largely developed for biosensor
applications. They include indifferent nanoparticles (metallic or
oxides), core–shells, quantum dots, wires, composites, and
others, associated with a large variety of combinations, putting them
in a bright growing in-sensor research perspective. Due to their structures
and intrinsic properties, they can be viewed as signal amplifiers,
biomimics, internal probes, or active interfaces (electron relay,
immobilization surface for the receptors). To improve their electrochemical
properties or sensitivity, these NCMs are often combined with graphene-based
materials or conductive or insulating polymers, etc. A representative
example developed recently by Qin et al.12 is shown in Figure 2 for specific diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD).

In their work, a modified conductive electrode
has been prepared
from gold nanoparticles and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT).
This composite has been subsequently modified by the electropolymerization
of poly(thiophene-3-acetic acid) (PTAA) in order to immobilize the
PrPC (cellular prion protein) bioreceptors of the AβO
(amyloid β oligomer) biomarker. All fabrication steps as well
as the PrPC–AβO binding have been monitored
by EIS analysis. Ultrahigh sensitivity of the device was demonstrated
at the subfemtomolar level (from 10–8 to 104 nM). The authors have pointed out the dependence of the response
based on the fabrication process of the electrode. However, optimized
device fabrication electrodes display a good stability over 1 month
and linearity of the readout signal during this period with a device
storage at 4 °C.

3.2 Sensing Ions
The
detection of “heavy
metals” remains a major concern because they are responsible
for several environmental and health problems when they are in concentrations
as low as ppm or even ppb. Heavy metal ion contamination comes, in
most cases, from anthropogenic activities. Among them, Cu2+, Pb2+, As5+, Cr6+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ are the most toxic representatives due to their
nonbiodegradability and environmental/body accumulation concerns,
although microelectrode array devices13 have been developed and have proven, in the past decade, to be ultrasensitive
methods for individual heavy metal detection. Simultaneous multiple
detection remains quite challenging but is of crucial interest for
practical use. To this aim, Lu et al.14 have recently developed a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
with the GA-UiO-66-NH2 composite (Figure 3), obtained from the incorporation of the
metal–organic framework UiO-66-NH2 into a graphene
aerogel matrix (GA). The modified GA-UiO-66-NH2-GC electrode
was then used as an electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous detection
of multiple heavy metals including Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in soil, water, and vegetables
by a differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) technique. Interestingly,
in a concerted way, an excellent limit of detection was attained for
each ion using this modified electrode for Cu2+ (8 nM),
Pb2+ (1 nM), Cd2+ (9 nM), and Hg2+ (0.9 nM), respectively, with high accuracy and reliability. Ion
detection came from the interaction of ions with the amino group of
MOF as shown in Figure 3. Accuracy and reliability were verified by performing measurements
with interfering ions (at a concentration of 5-fold-order greater)
and in real samples including river water, soil, and vegetable. The
largest relative standard deviation (RSD) among all measurements was
3.2%, and the recovery for Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ was found to be between 86.7 and 104.7%.

For the last two decades, anions that are ubiquitous in many physiological
life processes and agricultural and environmental areas have attracted
peculiar attention. Synthesis of artificial hosts for anion recognition
received significant interest and became an important area of research
in supramolecular chemistry in order to develop efficient and specific
systems of recognition that could be further implemented in sensor
devices. Among them, halide anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–) represent an important
class and have been extensively studied15 but are still of great importance due to their practical use in
medicine and industrial processes for instance. Recently, Hijazi et
al. have demonstrated the possible use of halogen–halogen interactions
as a supramolecular recognition path in an electrochemical device
modulated by a redox process. Hence, a SAM-coated gold electrode surface,
which is end-capped with a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit bearing iodine
atoms at the terminal position, has been used as a sensitive layer
(namely, 4-ethylthio-(5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)-pentanoate)-4′,5′-di(iodo)-5-methylthio-tetrathiafulvalene).16 By coupling this system with cyclic voltammetry
(CV) they have successfully evidenced a halogen–halogen interaction
controlled upon redox activation of the TTF unit in the presence of
the halides of interest (Figure 4).

halogen
bonding in the presence of PF6– and halide
anions upon redox activation. Detection was performed by CV. (Reprinted

Society of Chemistry).

During their study, this
electrochemically driven system has been
proven to be particularly suitable for bromide and chloride detection
with a LOD of 6 μM for Cl–, paving the way
to new opportunities in the electrochemical sensor field.

Halides
are currently not the only anions of interest, and a myriad
of inorganic or organic anions can be found in the literature, driving
the specific design of sensors for the foreseen applications.17 Those can be either electroactive or not, depending
on their structure. Electrochemical direct access of their level can
be easily determined even in complex matrixes. To this aim, different
material combinations can be found to fit with the specific sensor
specifications and applications. Wang et al.18 have implemented a microchip for the in situ detection
of O2•– radical species using
fabricated screen-printed electrodes from ultrasmall Mn3(PO4)2 particles (55% w/w) embedded in chitosan
(CTS–Mn3(PO4)2) (Figure 5).

of the preparation of the nanocomposite
CTS–Mn3(PO4)2 and detection
mechanism. (Adapted with permission from ref (18). Copyright (2019) Elsevier
Science. Further permissions related to the material excerpted should
be directed to Elsevier Science).

Herein, the chitosan presents both the advantages to ensure the
biocompatibility of the nanocomposite and facilitate the diffusion
of the electrolyte due to the formation of a nanowire-woven microspherical
structure incorporating the Mn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles. This peculiar nanostructuration also possesses the
benefit to avoid the oxidative-stress-related cytotoxicity that might
be induced by nanoparticles. Interestingly, under physiological conditions,
the sensor exhibits good specificity and selectivity even in the presence
of putative interfering analytes such as ascorbic acid, uric acid,
or H2O2. The amperometric response recorded
at an applied potential of 0.7 V transduces the electrocatalytic activity
of the CTS–Mn3(PO4)2 composite
in which O2•– oxidizes Mn2+ into MnO2+ and H2O2 and then O2•– reduces
MnO2+ to Mn2+ and O2.
The excellent biocompatibility associated with a LOD of 9.4 nM with
a linear range from 57.9 nM to 5 μM makes the CTS–Mn3(PO4)2 composite highly attractive in
sensing devices.

3.3 Sensing Molecules/Molecular
Anionic Targets
One of the most challenging groups of pesticides
is the polar pesticide
group (glyphosate, glufosinate, fosetyl, difenzoquat, chloromequat,
trimethylsulfonium, etc.), which is attracting, nowadays, more and
more attention as they often occur as residues in food and are not
always included in pesticide monitoring programs. Recently, Cao et
al. developed, to this aim, a photoelectrochemical device sensor to
monitor glyphosate (Figure 6).19

Figure 6 Schematic illustration
of the analytical principle of Cu-BTC/CN-NS-based
electrochemical sensor. (Adapted with permission from ref (19). Copyright (2019) Elsevier
Science. Further permissions related to the material excerpted should
be directed to Elsevier Science).

The active layer combines two main components: (i) a graphite phase
nitrogenized carbon nanosheet (CN-NS), possessing both semiconducting
and good photocatalytic features, and (ii) a composite material Cu-BTC
(copper-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) as a metal–organic
framework (MOF) exhibiting catalytic properties. In the bare photocatalyst
composite, the MOFs play a dual role: they improve the photocurrent
conversion of the CN-NS upon irradiation with visible light, and their
porous structure allows efficient capture of the analytes. Thus, in
the presence of glyphosate, the photocatalyst composite exhibits a
linear concentration-dependent reduction of the generated photocurrent
due to the formation of a sterically hindered Cu–glyphosate
complex. The photoelectrochemical sensor demonstrates a LOD of about
1.3 × 10–13 M with good linear
range from 10–12 to 10–3 M associated
with low standard deviation after 10 successive measures (3.9%) and
good stability after 2 weeks. The sensitivity is not affected even
in the presence of some common interferents such as glufosinate, trichlorfon,
carbendazim, acetochlor, and malathion or some ions such as Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, Fe3+, Zn2+, Ca2+, K+, and Na+. All these characteristics demonstrate the great
potential of such hybrid composites for the sensing of a variety of
analytes in the future by combining the right components.

Electrochemical
devices have been extensively studied and continue
to fascinate the sensor research field due to their ease of fabrication
and implementation. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances these devices
face some threats and problems that are important to solve as the
research field is moving quicky toward flexible and wearable devices.

4 Microfabricated Electrical Sensors
Among
the miniaturizable devices, field-effect transistors fulfill
the needed requirements in the field of electrical sensor technologies.20 Since the very seminal work of Bergveld in the
70s,21 the development of ion-sensitive
field-effect transistor (ISFET) devices has dramatically increased
and evolved during the last five decades. Several device structures
in combination with a large variety of materials have been widely
used as, for instance, semiconducting carbon nanotubes,32 nanowires,26 and
organic semiconductors,25,31 particularly for biosensing
and environmental applications.22 In addition,
different structures and architectures can be achieved depending on
both the nature of the semiconductor, inorganic (MOSFET),30−33 or organic (OFET)25,28,31 and device geometry. OFETs can offer several advantages compared
to MOSFET for the foreseen applications and appear more promising
for detecting low concentrations of analyte and relevant for studying
biochemical interactions.23 Among the typical
devices, one can cite electrochemical organic transistors (EC-OTs),
charge-modulated field-effect transistors (CM-OEFTs), and electrolyte-gated
organic field-effect transistors (EG-OFETs). Each of them could be
designed with specific configurations, typically the bottom-gate top-contact
structure (BG-TC), the bottom-gate bottom-contact structure (BG-BC),
the top-gate top-contact structure (TG-TC), and the top-gate bottom-contact
structure (TG-BC) that will influence the sensitivity properties of
the designed sensors. Moreover, the proper functionalization of the
two main electronic active interfaces of the OFET (i.e., the gate
electrode or the organic semiconductor) is crucial to achieve novel
and efficient sensing devices.

4.1 Sensing Biological Anionic
Targets
In a recent work, Munoz et al. have used in an elegant
manner carbon
nanotubes (CNT) as a conductive component for the fabrication of a
nanocomposite carbon paste electrode (NC-CPE) in an EG-OFET to replace
and widen the conventional metal-gated electrode system.24 NC-CPE is still underexploited in sensing devices
and opens new opportunities and benefits due to their intrinsic properties
(ability to tailor the conductivity of the composite, ease of fabrication,
robustness, compatibility with several functionalization approaches,
possibility to renew their surface). By integrating gold nanoparticles
functionalized with thiolated β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), they
succeeded to sense tryptophan in PBS solutions at pH 7.4 (Figure 7).

Figure 7 NC-CP electrode as an
alternative to conventional metal-gated electrode
in sensing devices. (Reprinted with permission from ref (24). Copyright (2019) Royal
Society of Chemistry. Further permissions related to the material
excerpted should be directed to the Royal Society of Chemistry).

The aim of the gold nanoparticles is to ensure
an appropriate orientation
of the β-CD’s cavity on the CNT surface and electrical
contact. The electrical properties of the transistor can be tailored
by adjusting the composition ratio of the modified CNT and the matrix
polymer. This unique EG-OFET biosensor shows excellent analytical
response with a detection limit at the picomolar range (1.0 ±
0.1 pM) and a good linear response from 10–12 to
10–9 M associated with good stability and repeatability.
More interestingly, by polishing the NC-CPE’s surface, it is
possible to recover the sensing layer without loss of the sensitivity
properties.

In a similar way, Macchia et al. recently claimed
the possibility
to detect proteins at the physical limit. To do so, they achieved
the label-free single-molecule detection (IgG, IgM) by covalently
modifying a gate electrode of an EG-OFET with a SAM made from anti-IgM
or anti-IgG.25 The antibodies were grafted
on a chemical layer (chem-SAM) comprised of mixed alkanethiols (3-mercaptopropionic
acid (MPA)/11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) at a ratio 10:1). Hence,
IgM or anti-IgG was grafted on the MUA, while unreacted carboxylic
groups were blocked with ethanolamine. The uncovered area was then
filled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein (Figure 8).

Chemical Society).

During the device fabrication,
they evidenced a high degree of
antibodies grafted on the surface and proved that both BSA and the
presence of a H-bonding network in the chem-SAM are essential to achieve
good performance in the sensing of single molecules that can be useful
for early detection of diseases.

Noninvasive diagnostics of
diseases at the early stage is of great
importance to anticipate the treatments and improve the quality of
life of patients. To reach these goals, there is an urgent need to
develop research and care strategies associated with low-cost and
high sensibilities. Any pathology produces unique biomarkers that
are characteristics of the physiological disorder and can be exploited
as an internal probe or using specific DNA strands as probes. In this
context, Liu et al.26 have fabricated a
high-performance FET-based DNA biosensor through CVD of a MoS2 monolayer dedicated to trisomy 21 syndrome screening in blood
samples of pregnant women. Herein, the deposition of AuNPs within
the MoS2 channel is followed with immobilization of the
specific DNA probe (Figure 9).

Figure 9 FET-based DNA biosensors. (Adapted with permission from ref (26). Copyright (2019) American
Chemical Society. Further permissions related to the material excerpted
should be directed to the American Chemical Society).

With this system, they have been able to achieve detection
of the
target DNA fragment (chromosomes 21 or 13) with a LOD below 100 aM.
This sensitivity associated with a high specificity (3-nucleotide
polymorphism discrimination) satisfies the requirements of the Down
syndrome diagnosis.

Detecting specific blood biomarkers is a
promising strategy to
access early diseases diagnosis. For instance, colon cancer secreted
protein-2 (CCSP-2) has been identified as a colorectal cancer (CRC)
biomarker and has been used by Jeun et al. to develop a CRC-sensor
based on a FET.27 For real-life clinical
applications a disposable multiwell gate has been fabricated on which
the modified FET chips were sealed with an epoxy resin to ensure complete
stability and compatibility with the blood environment (Figure 10).

gate (DMWG) modified with a cancer biomarker.

In this device, they have used an ISFET device under dual-gate
operation in which the DMWG gate (SnO2) has been chemically
modified with a CCSP-2 antibody, while the unreacted sites were treated
with ethanolamine followed by incubation with BSA to prevent nonspecific
adsorption of blood proteins. The novel electrical sensor exhibits
high sensitivity with a LOD of 10 ag·mL–1 and
a linear response in the 1 fg·mL–1 to 10 ng·mL–1 range. Interestingly, the sensor is able to detect
the biomarker in a wide range of samples from early stage tumors to
metastatic disease and has been clinically validated. Nonetheless,
the device still suffers from a lack of stability and needs to be
improved prior to market development.

4.2 Sensing
Ions
Cation analysis and
detection by FETs have been extensively studied since the early development
of the ISFET. Numerous devices have been fabricated and tested for
the detection of heavy metals, first for environmental and food concerns,
but have been then progressively extended to medical purposes. Although
efforts are still being made to improve the cation detection in FET
devices and for fabrication to fully organic devices,28 the general tendency of the ongoing research is the realization
of multiplexed analysis of complex matrixes using wearable devices.
Therefore, more sophisticated devices are needed to allow the possibility
to determine the concentration of different analytes or bioanalytes
within one run analysis. Zhang et al.29 have recently reported the fabrication of a wearable sweat sensor
(10 × 20 μm2) based on the CMOS technology (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Multiplexed analysis
of cations. (Reprinted with permission from
ref (29)). Copyright

material excerpted should be directed to the American Chemical Society).

Three different cations (K+, Na+, and Ca2+) and pH (H+) have been recorded
simultaneously
in the course of the analysis, and they exhibit high sensitivities
that are close to the Nernstian limit. The high specificity for each
analyte was brought by the surface functionalization with ion-specific
membranes in conjunction with, respectively, Al2O3 (pH), valinomycin ionophore (K+), calix[4]arene (Na+), and ETH 5234 ionophore (Ca2+). Interestingly,
a demonstrator was fabricated with ultralow electrical consumption
(2 pW per sensor) including a readout interface and NFC communication
(for pH and Na+) with in vitro measurements
suited for wearable sweat sensing.

Besides, anions have been
the subject of peculiar attention because
of their importance in many biological or biochemical processes. Also,
compared to their cationic counterpart, they present various shapes,
structures, and sizes, rendering them somewhat more delicate to detect.30 Hence, they have stretched a lot of efforts
in the synthesis and design of artificial receptors prior to their
integration in real detection devices. Moreover, easy manufacturing
processes for implementing sensors are sought to reduce the fabrication
steps and costs. In this context, Bath et al.31 have used the inkjet printing technology, as a patterning tool,
to fabricate on PET substrates an Ag/rGO-based nanostructure sensor
for the detection of phosphate. The fabrication process is depicted
in Figure 12.

The sensor displays
excellent performances with a LOD of 1.20 μM
even in the presence of interfering ions such as TTP, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, HCO3–, and SO42– associated with long-term
stability and reproducibility.

In food safety and quality control,
the titration and detection
of preservative and food additive amounts are of great significance
due to their potential toxicity and must follow the food regulations.
Among them, sulfite is of major interest since it is present in several
beverages (juices, alcohols) and has suspicious effects on human health.
To this context, Wang et al. have designed a novel solution-gated
graphene-based transistor (SGGT).32 In
this device, the gold gate electrode was modified by a nanocomposite
prepared from multiwall carbon nanotubes (length 0.5–2 μm,
diameter >0.8 nm) and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTAB), while graphene
is used as a semiconductor (Figure 13).

in beverages.

Continuous sulfite detection
with this SGGT leads to a wide linear
response range (from 1 to 10 μm, 95 mV per decade) associated
with a low LOD (30 nM which is 30 times greater compared to SGGT with
unmodified gate) and high selectivity when putative competitive analytes
were tested such as K+, NO2–, CO32–, HCO3–, SO42–, NO3–, and ethanol. The performances of the device led the authors to
further detect sulfite in real alcoholic beverage samples (vodka and
the Chinese Laobaigan liquor) and compared them consecutively to the
AOAC Official Monier-William standard method. Similar results were
attained in both cases, testifying to the relevance of this innovative
device and opening new directions for practical sample sensing.

4.3 Sensing Molecules/Molecular Anionic Targets
Continuous accurate detection in aqueous media of anions is of
great importance in the field of healthcare and requires well-designed
OFETs. In this context, Minamiki et al. have recently designed and
fabricated a biosensor based on OFETs for the detection of the lactate
as a biomarker.33 Extended gate-type OFETs,
with a small sensing area of 1.65 mm2, have been developed
and successfully modified by a horseradish peroxidase/osmium redox
polymer complex and lactate oxidase as a sensing layer (Figure 14).

solution detection. (Adapted with permission

The device made from DNTT (dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) as an organic
semiconductor operates under low voltage and exhibits excellent electrical
characteristics and stability in aqueous media. Moreover, the sensor
has shown excellent responses and sufficient sensitivity, in PBS solution,
to lactate (0–10 mM), and no responses were obtained with common
interferent analytes found in sweat such as urea, glucose, p-cresol, MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl,
making this device a system of choice for foreseen application.

As already mentioned, simultaneous and real-time detection of multiple
analytes is of great significance notably for biomedical applications.
To reach such an objective lab-on-chip based on field effect transistors
has stimulated a lot of interest, as they meet the foreseen requirements.
Nanowire-based FET sensors have been envisioned for the detection
of biological/chemical species but are still underexplored. For this
purpose, Krivitsky et al. have developed a sensor based on a nanowire
FET exhibiting tailored redox properties, allowing the simultaneous
real-time sensing of several metabolites (Figure 15).34

FET sensors for the detection of metabolites. (Adapted

Chemical Society).

In their work, they
have covalently grafted molecular redox-active
species, based on a 9,10-anthraquinone derivative (AQ) that is sensitive
to reactive oxygen species (ROS) on a p-type silicon
NW-FET array surface. ROS, such as H2O2, are
able to oxidize DHA (dihydroquinone) into AQ, which is reversibly
reduced in the presence of a mild reductant (i.e., diethylhydroxylamine
(DEHA)) or by applying an electric potential. The SiNW-FET conductivity
is alternatively switched from an “off” state to an
“on” state when DHA is oxidized to AQ in the presence
of H2O2 followed by the addition of DEHA. In
order to convert the analyzed metabolites into H2O2, the redox-active center is combined with oxidase enzymes
that are specific to the desired metabolites. The use of microfluidics
allows the possibility to introduce all components in the appropriate
compartments at the microliter scale. Six different metabolites have
been tested (H2O2, glucose, pyruvate, lactate,
choline, and pH), and the device has been calibrated prior to real
metabolite screening for a minimal number of 104–106 cells/mL with a LOD for H2O2 in the
range of 100 nM. Finally, the performances have been evaluated on
a section of solid tumor, highlighting the effectiveness of the developed
sensor in real conditions. Interestingly, their sensor has shown reversibility
and reusability capabilities and has demonstrated real-time metabolite
monitoring by simulating a hypothetic cancer treatment by adding 2-deoxy-d-glucose, a known glycolysis inhibitor which modifies the concentration
of glucose, pyruvate, and lactate. Although their sensor device is
not optimized yet, they have nicely evidenced the possibility to achieve
multiplex detection and monitoring.

OFET sensors have stretched
the greatest keen interest in the last
decades as they offer unique characteristics and a wide variety of
architectures, and they can be fabricated, allowing them to meet the
desired requirements. They are compatible with the societal demand
encompassing real-time sensing and monitoring with wearable devices.
Even if the ultimate Holy Grail sensor is not obtained yet, the general
trends demonstrate great advances in that direction.

5 Conclusions and Outlook
The last decades have witnessed
an intense development of the sensor
field for applications in a variety of areas (health, environment,
foodstuffs) in order to improve, for example, their selectivity, specificity,
and reliability due to a high societal demand. To this aim, integration
of nano-organic-based materials (NOMs) in electrochemical and electrical
sensors is responsible for these technological achievements because
they can be interfaced with electronic mobile devices. NOMs can further
be hybridized with other materials to optimize their properties or
obtain synergistic effects. They are directly used to modify the electrode
surfaces, as support for grafting the sensing elements, or act as
artificial receptors, signal modulators, and so on (Table 1).

Although huge gaps have been filled since the very
seminal works,
some fabrication procedures to achieve the modified electrodes are
somewhat prohibitive, tedious, and complicated, restricting their
technological transfer and their possible commercialization for practical
use. The existing issues must be solved in order to ensure their full
integration and be used at the point-of-need. In addition, the robustness
of the sensors has to be proved and must be validated following the
regulations. Device improvements will contribute to the access of
reliable measurements, accurate responses, and reusable devices associated
with high stabilities under long-term storage and operation and ruggedness.
Moreover, intrusive and nonintrusive wearable self-powered devices
and/or ingestible sensors to monitor patients’ health will
be of great interest in the future, but there are still numerous technological
hurdles to surmount. Furthermore, development of multiplex sensors
is needed to have all-in-one detection devices not only for different
substances but also for a family of contaminants in more and more
complex matrixes. Some examples have been recently developed, but
a lot of challenges remain to be overcome. The nanotechnologies will
help to fulfill the needed requirements, taking into account also
the close collaboration of different research areas to develop new
concepts and strategies to provide commercially viable devices.
