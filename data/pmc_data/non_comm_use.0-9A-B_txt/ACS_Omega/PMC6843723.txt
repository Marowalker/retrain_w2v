Gold-based nanomaterials have attracted
extensive interest for potential application in photothermal therapy
(PTT) owing to their distinctive properties including high photothermal
transduction, biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity. Herein, assembled
gold nanoparticle architecture-based photothermal conversion agents
were synthesized by using polysaccharides (alginate dialdehyde, ADA)
as both the cross-linker to induce self-assembly of diphenylalanine
(FF) and the reducer for in situ reduction of Au3+ ions
into Au nanoparticles (Au NPs). The extinction spectrum of the obtained
self-assembled ADA–FF/Au nanospheres was finely modulated into
a near-infrared region by controlling the growth of Au NPs inside
the assemblies. The strong plasmonic coupling effect of the assembled
Au NPs also leads to high photothermal conversion (η = 40%)
of the ADA–FF/Au nanospheres, hence presenting good performance
in PTT and photoacoustic imaging. This synthesis technique is promising
to construct nanomaterials with desired functions for potential biomedical
application by self-assembly of various nanocrystals in situ.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Photothermal
therapy (PTT), which “cooks” cancer cells using photothermal
conversion agents (PTCAs) to convert optical energy to heat, has attracted
lot of attention because of its spatiotemporal addressability and
minimal invasiveness.1 High photothermal
transduction efficiency, absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) region,
and facial synthesis process are crucial for the further application
of PTCAs in PTT.2 Among these, the absorption
in the NIR region is considered to be a key property of PTCAs because
the NIR light can deeply penetrate into soft tissues on account of
low absorption and scattering from blood, water, and tissue.3

Gold-based nanostructures have been developed
as PTCAs because of their biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and
their photothermal conversion capability,4,5 Spherical
gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-based
nanomaterials, which can transfer the optical energy to heat relying
on their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties, have
been extensively studied for PTT, however subjected to the low extinction
in NIR.6 Then, gold nanomaterials with
various morphologies, including nanorods,7,8 nanocages,9 and nanoshells,10 have
been tried and proved to be effective as PTCAs. However, those gold-based
nanomaterials suffer from radiation instability, poor repeatability
in synthesis, and biotoxicity for future applications.11−13 Au NP architectures self-assembled by Au NPs with polymers or biomacromolecules
may overcome these disadvantages by tuning LSPR of Au NPs from visible
to the NIR region while retaining the stability of the nanomaterials.5,14,15 Recently, Nie et al.16,17 successfully fabricated vesicular superparticles by assembly of
Au NPs with the assistance of amphiphilic block copolymers, thus the
extinction spectrum was effectively red-shifted to the NIR region
because of the strong plasmon couplings between adjacent Au NPs. Furthermore,
the ultrahigh surface plasmon also enhances the performance of the
assembled gold nanomaterials in photoacoustic (PA) imaging.18−20

Generally, construction of self-assembled Au NP architectures
consists of three steps, including synthesis of dispersed Au NPs,
surface modification of Au NPs using functionalized polymers, and
acquiring self-assembly architectures by cross-link or self-assembly
with polymers.14,21 In some cases, the obtained structures
are coated by biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol to
guarantee the stabilization and biocompatibility of the products in
the biotic environment.22,23 Obviously, these tedious
synthesis processes are time-consuming and the yield is relatively
low.

Our previous work verified that alginate dialdehyde (ADA)
can be used as both the cross-linker to induce self-assembly of FF
and the in situ reducer of Au3+ ions into Au nanoparticles
(Au NPs) to form gold-based nanospheres as nanodrug carriers in a
very simple and high-yielding one-pot synthesis progress.24,25 However, the Au NPs inside the nanospheres are quite discrete, which
cannot modulate the absorption spectra of the assembled nanospheres
to the NIR region. In this work, nucleation and growth of Au NPs inside
the ADA–FF nanospheres are precisely controlled to regulate
the distance between adjacent Au NPs. Thus, a plasmonic coupling effect
was enhanced by the formation of abundant inter-nanoparticle junctions,
causing the absorption peak of the ADA–FF/Au nanospheres shift
from visible to NIR region. These ADA–FF/Au nanospheres present
excellent PA response and enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency
(η = 40%) upon 808 nm laser irradiation. The in vitro experiment
indicates their good compatibility and photothermal treatment effect
of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of ADA–FF/Au Nanospheres
ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
are synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. When HAuCl4 solution was mixed with FF
and ADA, the aldehyde groups of ADA and the amino groups of FF reacted
and formed Schiff base covalent bonds between them, generating the
ADA–FF unit. Meanwhile, the Au3+ irons are in situ
reduced to Au NPs by aldehyde groups of ADA and attached to the polymer
chain because of the formation of coordination bindings with ADA.
Continuous injection of HAuCl4 is exploited to grow the
gold seeds, hence forming ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. The interparticle
distance between adjacent Au NPs can be finely controlled by adjusting
the particle size of Au NPs.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Synthesis
Process of ADA–FF/Au Nanospheres and Their Applications in
PTT and PA Imaging
Figures 1a and S1 show
the morphological evolution of the ADA–FF/Au nanospheres during
synthesis. It can be found that self-assembled ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
containing small gold seeds are quickly formed when Au3+ is added into the solution. After continuous injection of diluted
Au3+ solution for 15 min, the size of the Au NPs increases,
whereas Au NPs are still discrete, and 60 min later, ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres with assembled Au NPs inside are formed. Figure 1b shows, in this process, that
the size of the Au NPs increases from 8 to 30 nm in ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres, indicating the gradual growth of Au NPs with continuous
dropping of Au3+ solution. The growth of Au NPs shortened
the interparticle distances, which results in a red shift of the absorption
spectra (Figure 1c)
from visible to NIR region because a plasmonic coupling effect is
enhanced between adjacent Au NPs. Meanwhile, a color change of the
solution from pink to cyan can be observed during this process (Figure 1c inset). However,
with the prolongation of reaction time, the LSPR absorption peak broadens,
probably because of the nonuniform particle size distribution of Au
NPs. It is observed that ADA–FF/Au nanospheres have an average
hydrodynamic diameter of 253 nm and highly negative charged surface
(−30 mV, Figure S2), indicating
the presence of COO– groups of polymers on the surface
of nanospheres, which gives the stability of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
in aqueous solutions. This could also be confirmed by the smooth surface
of the nanospheres, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of Figure S3. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) (Figure S4) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) elemental mapping of ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres (Figure 1d) indicate the compositions of C, N, O, and Au and most of Au NPs
are located inside the nanospheres, causing the abundant internanoparticle
junctions among Au NPs.

nanospheres. (b) Effective diameters of Au NPs in ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres. (c) Absorption spectra and color change (inset) of intermediate
products during synthesis. (d) Elemental maps of ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres.

Figure 2a shows the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectra of FF, ADA, and ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. For ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres, the peak at 3255 cm–1 attributed to
the fact that the stretching vibration of −NH2 largely
weakened when Schiff bonds (C=N) were formed between FF and
ADA.26 The peak at 1731 cm–1 belonging to the free aldehyde group of ADA disappears, which may
relate to the large consumption of CHO in reducing Au3+ and the formation of Schiff bonds with FF.27 The peak of amino I at 1604 cm–1 in FF shifts
to 1619 cm–1 in ADA–FF/Au nanospheres because
of the formation of C=N stretching bonds. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of N 1s band (Figure 2b) also confirm the existence of Schiff bonds.
The peak at 399 eV belongs to the C=N group and the peak located
at 400.4 eV is attributed to the O=C–N groups.28 The peaks located at 85.2 and 88.2 eV in the
Au 4f band spectra (Figure 2c) belong to gold atoms, which illustrate the absence of other
metallic compounds.29Figure 2d shows an emission peak centered
at 306 nm in the fluorescent emission (FL) spectrum of FF, whereas
a peak at 410 nm emerged for ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. This result
indicates that FF may use J-aggregate arrangements in ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres through the π–π interactions between
aromatic groups. Another new peak at 460 nm suggests the formation
of Schiff bonds between ADA and FF.30,31

In this synthesis process, it is revealed that
the interparticle distance between adjacent Au NPs is of crucial importance
for the plasmonic coupling effect, which enables the absorption range
of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres broaden to the NIR region. The trick
of precisely controlling the nucleation and growth of Au NPs depends
on the concentration of Au3+ solution. Gold seeds generate
under conditions of high chemical supersaturation while the growth
stage proceeds under a much slower and milder reducing condition.32−34 Herein, a high concentration of HAuCl4 was used first
to quickly form gold seeds in the system. Then, a diluted HAuCl4 solution is slowly injected for the growth of seeds, decreasing
secondary nucleation in the system. The reaction medium is another
crucial factor for the synthesis of ADA-FF/Au nanospheres. In this
work, ethanol is added to reduce the solubility ADA in the reaction
medium, thus avoiding free ADA in water to generate dissociated Au
NPs in the system.35 After the formation
of Au seeds, the ethanol solution of HAuCl4 was slowly
injected into reaction system. Thus, Au3+ ions are prone
to be reduced inside the nanospheres because there is almost no free
ADA in the continuous phase. Figure 3a–e shows that with the increment of ethanol,
the amount of free Au NPs gradually decrease and eventually disappear.
Nevertheless, it can be observed that the Au NPs inside the nanospheres
with 120 μL of ethanol (Figure 3e) are smaller and more homogeneous than that with
90 μL of ethanol (Figure 3d). The absorption spectrum (Figure 3f) shows an obvious red shift of the LSPR
peak from the visible to the NIR region with the increase of ethanol
dosage. However, ethanol cannot be added in a whole, which may cause
a severe agglomeration possibly because free ADA chains are prone
to precipitate out.

in solution and (f) their UV–vis absorption spectra.

2.2 Photothermal Effect and
PA Imaging of ADA–FF/Au Nanospheres
Because of the
strong plasmatic absorption in the NIR region, the photothermal effect
of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres was measured to confirm their potential
application in tumor treatment. Figure 4a illustrates that when irradiating with an 808 nm
laser at 1.5 W/cm2, the temperature of ADA–FF/Au
nanosphere aqueous dispersion with different concentrations (0–200
μg/mL) all increase more quickly as the concentration increases.
After 5 min of irradiation, the temperature of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere
aqueous dispersion with the concentration of 200 μg/mL ascents
to 61.4 °C, while the temperature of water only elevates by 2.3
°C. Moreover, the temperature of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere
aqueous dispersion increases more rapidly when increasing the laser
power (0.5–2 W/cm2), while the concentration is
fixed to 100 μg/mL, as shown in Figure 4b. The changes of temperature during irradiation
can be directly observed by infrared photos (Figure 4c,d). After being heated under 2 W/cm2 laser irradiation for 15 min, the sample was cooled to room
temperature. It no obvious change in TEM images and absorption spectra
(Figure S5) has been found, showing the
good stability of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres in PTT.

images of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere aqueous dispersion with different
concentrations and (d) different irradiation time. (e) Temperature
evaluation of the dispersion with laser on for 5 min and then turned
off. (f) Time vs
negative natural logarithm of the temperature during the cooling period.

A vital index, photothermal conversion efficiency
(η), is measured to estimate the potential application of photothermal
agents in PTT. According to the conversion model in previous work,21 100 μg/mL of ADA-FF/Au nanosphere aqueous
dispersion was exploited as the representative. The temperature was
recorded each 10 s and shown in picture (Figure 4e). The η of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
is calculated according to the formulas. 1   2  

In eq 1, h is the heat-transfer
coefficient, S is the container surface area, Tmax is the highest temperature, Tsurr is the ambient temperature, and Q0 is the heat generated by water and container under laser
irradiation. In eq 2, P is the laser power, A808 is
the absorption intensity of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres at 808 nm,
m is the mass of the solution, CH2O is the heat capacity of water, and τs is
the time constant.15Figure 4f shows that the constant (τs) is determined to be 226.3. Then, the photothermal transduction
efficiency is calculated to be 40%, which is higher than that of gold
nanorods (18%),11 gold nanoshells (22%),36 and gold nanoplates (29%),37 indicating the strong plasmonic coupling effect of the
Au NPs inside the nanospheres.

PA imaging is a valid way to
detect deeper tissue signals in human body.38 Emerging exogenous contrast agents can effectively transfer the
light energy to a temperature rise in the tissue and produce ultrasonic
waves through thermoelastic expansion.39,40 Because the
strong plasmonic coupling effect of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres caused
absorption in the NIR region, it is reasonable to hypothesize that
it could also be used as an agent for PA imaging.41 The samples show strong bright signals in PA images compared
with those without ADA–FF/Au nanospheres in water, and the
signals become much brighter with the increase of concentration (Figure 5a). Moreover, Figure 5b confirms that the
PA signal is a linear variation with the concentration of ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres.

Figure 5 (a) PA images and (b) intensities of the dispersion irradiated
with NIR laser.

As illustrated, ADA–FF/Au
nanospheres exhibit good performances both in PTT and PA imaging because
of their strong absorption in the NIR region and a good light-to-heat
conversion. It could be concluded that shortening the distance between
the adjacent Au NPs in gold-based nanospheres by precisely modulating
the nucleation and growth of Au NPs enhances the plasmonic coupling
effect.

2.3 Cytoxicity and in Vitro Photothermal Effect
of ADA–FF/Au Nanospheres
To further confirm the potential
application of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres in tumor therapy, cytoxicity
in human tumor cells (4T1 cells) was measured by determining cellular
viability using a CCK-8 assay. In the assessment, 4T1 cells were incubated
for 24 h before use. Then, 0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL
of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere aqueous dispersion were added into
96-hole plates to incubate with 4T1 cells for another 24 h. As shown
in Figure 6a, the cell
viability still maintains a high level (cell viability ≥ 95%)
while concentration of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres reaches 200 μg/mL.
Therefore, the result shows that ADA–FF/Au nanospheres have
a good biocompatibility and can be tested in vitro for further researches.

of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. (b) Cell viabilities of 4T1 with
and without 808 nm laser irradiation (2 W/cm2, 15 min).
(c) Confocal microscopic images of 4T1 cells stained by calcein-AM/propidium
iodide.

The cell viability of 4T1 cells
with and without laser irradiation was compared to confirm the in
vitro photothermal effect of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. Different
concentrations of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres were incubated with
4T1 cells for 4 h before irradiation. CCK-8 assay shows (Figure 6b) that with the
increase of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere concentration, more than 95%
of cells are still alive for every controlled group without irradiation,
while after irradiating under NIR laser for 15 min, the cell viability
remarkably decreases and becomes lower along with the increase of
ADA–FF/Au nanosphere concentration. When the concentration
reaches 200 μg/mL, merely 20% of cells are alive. Calcein-AM
(green) and PI (red), which are able to differentiate live and dead
cells, are also exploited to evaluate the cell viability (Figure 6c). The red fluorescence
only appears when the cells are incubated with ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
and irradiated by the laser, suggesting that this material enables
to kill cancer cells in vitro PTT.

3 Conclusion
In summary, ADA–FF/Au nanospheres were synthesized by using
a facial method with ADA as both the reducer for in situ reduction
of Au3+ ions into Au NPs and the cross-linker to induce
self-assembly of FF. The size of Au NPs in nanospheres was adjusted
to shorten the distance between adjacent particles and lead to a red
shift of the LSPR absorption into the NIR region. In general, the
as-obtained ADA–FF/Au nanospheres have the following features:
(i) good PTT effect and high photothermal conversion efficiency (η
= 40%); (ii) simultaneous and sensitive PA imaging performance; and
(iii) good biocompatibility. This unique Au-based nanomaterial is
promising to further promote the practical applications of novel PTCAs
for cancer therapeutic and diagnostic.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Ethanol, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP), diphenylalanine peptide (FF, 98%), gold chloride trihydrate
(HAuCl4·3H2O, ≥99.9%), sodium alginate,
and sodium periodate (NaIO4) were all purchased from Aladdin
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

4.2 Preparation of Polysaccharide–diphenylalanine/Au
(ADA–FF/Au) Nanospheres
ADA was obtained by an oxidization
reaction of sodium alginate.42 Typically,
FF (3.9 mg) dissolved in HFIP (130 μL) was mixed with 1 mL of
ADA aqueous solution at 70 °C, followed by the addition of HAuCl4 solution (25 μL, 50 mM). When the color of the solution
turned into pink, a HAuCl4 aqueous solution (6.67 mM, 1500
mL) mixed with a certain amount of (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 μL)
ethanol was injected into the solution with the a speed of 1.5 mL/h
continuously to obtain ADA–FF/Au nanospheres. The reaction
was continued for another 1 h after dropping of Au3+. Finally,
the products were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min
and washed three times with deionized water and then stored at 5 °C
for subsequent characterization.

4.3 Photothermal
Effect and PA Imaging of ADA–FF/Au Nanospheres
The
0.30 mL of ADA-FF/Au nanosphere aqueous dispersion (50, 100, 150,
and 200 μg/mL) was pipetted into a 1 mL centrifugation tube
and exposed under a 808 nm laser radiation (FC-808-5000-MM/1–5000Mw, China) on a 0.66 cm spot with the power density
of 1.5 W/cm2. Then, 0.30 mL of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere
aqueous dispersion (100 μg/mL) was irradiated under the same
condition at different power densities (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 W/cm2). NIR camera (FLIR-T62101, Sweden) was used to record the
temperature of the solution each 10 s for 5 min.

To test the
photothermal conversion efficiency of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres,
0.30 mL of ADA–FF/Au nanosphere (100 μg/mL) aqueous dispersion
in centrifuged tubes was irradiated upon laser on 0.66 cm spot at
a power density of 1.5 W/cm2 for 5 min and cooled down
for another 5 min without laser irradiation. Real-time temperature
of the solution was recorded in the same way as mentioned above.43

The PA signals of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
were obtained from an agarose gel phantom having different concentrations
of ADA–FF/Au nanospheres (0, 38, 76, 153, 246, and 307 μg/mL)
using a multimode PA imager (Vevo LAZR, America).

4.4 Cytoxicity Assay and in Vitro Photothermal Effect of ADA–FF/Au
Nanospheres
The tumor cell viability assay was conducted
using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). 4T1 cells were cultured in the
standard cell media for 24 h. Then, ADA–FF/Au nanospheres with
various concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL)
were incubated with cells in the 96-hole plates for 24 h. Next, 10
μL of CCK-8 solution with culture media was added and incubated
with cells for another 2 h. Subsequently, the optical densities of
the cells were analyzed at an absorbance of 450 nm, which was the
exact wavelength for CCK-8 assay.44 The
cell viability was calculated according to the articles.45

To investigate the photothermal effect
of the products, 4T1 cells with and without ADA–FF/Au nanospheres
(0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL) were incubated for 4 h and
then exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser (2 W/cm2, 15 min).
Next, a CCK-8 assay and a calcein-AM/PI test were employed to evaluate
the cell viability. The CCK-8 assay was exploited in the same way
as mentioned above and the calcein-AM/PI staining assay was conducted
as follows. After irradiation, calcein-AM solution was used to stain
the cells for 30 min, followed by washing cells with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for three times. Then, the PI solution was used to dye
cells for another 10 min and PBS was used to wash cells for three
times. After being treated with calcein-AM and PI, the cells were
observed via a confocal microscope (Nikon C2+, Japan).46

4.5 Characterization
Morphologies of the products were observed using a transmission electron
microscope (Tecnai G2 20 TWIN, America) at an acceleration voltage
of 200 kV with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a field emission
SEM (Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) with a CCD camera under a 20 kV voltage.
The elemental composition and distribution of the product were characterized
using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, America)
at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and an energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometer (X-Max 80T, America). The UV–vis absorption spectrum
was recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda
750, America) under ambient conditions. Fluorescent emission (FL)
spectra were recorded using a PTI QM40 instrument (America). The particle
sizes, size distribution, and zeta potential of the products were
achieved by using a Nano-ZS90 (Malvern, England). The FTIR spectrum
of the samples was conducted with powder-pressed KBr pellets using
a Nicolet Nexus 470 instrument (America). XPS analysis was executed
with a PHI 5000C instrument (America).
