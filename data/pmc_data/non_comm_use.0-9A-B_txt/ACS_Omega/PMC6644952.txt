In situ near-edge
X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy
and density functional theory calculations were conducted to demonstrate
the decomposition mechanism of propylene glycol methyl ether acetate
(PGMEA) on a MnO2–CuO catalyst. The catalytic activity
of MnO2–CuO was higher than that of MnO2 at low temperatures, although the pore properties of MnO2 were similar to those of MnO2–CuO. In addition,
whereas the chemical state of MnO2 remained constant following
PGMEA dosing at 150 °C, MnO2–CuO was reduced
under identical conditions, as confirmed by in situ NEXAFS spectroscopy.
These results indicate that the presence of Cu in the MnO2–CuO catalyst enables the release of oxygen at lower temperatures.
More specifically, the released oxygen originated from the Mn–O–Cu moiety on the top layer of the MnO2–CuO structure, as confirmed by calculation of the oxygen
release energies in various oxygen positions of MnO2–CuO.
Furthermore, the spectral changes in the in situ NEXAFS spectrum of
MnO2–CuO following the catalytic reaction at 150
°C corresponded well with those of the simulated NEXAFS spectrum
following oxygen release from Mn–O–Cu.
Finally, after the completion of the catalytic reaction, the quantities
of lactone and ether functionalities in PGMEA decreased, whereas the
formation of C=C bonds was observed.

Introduction
The volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) released from industrial
process in factories and during fossil fuel burning are air pollutants
with the potential to harm both human health and the environment.
For example, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) is used
in the manufacture of semiconductors and displays, and it can be detected
in air. It is therefore necessary to develop techniques to remove
VOCs such as PGMEA from the air. For this purpose, metal oxide catalysts
have drawn significant attention to date due to their low costs compared
to noble metal catalysts.1−3 In recent years, catalytic activities
have dramatically increased at low temperatures through the use of
hybrid metal oxides,4−9 thereby indicating that these materials have the potential for application
in industrial VOC removal.

Among the various hybrid metal oxides
examined to date, Mn–Cu
oxides have received particular attention for removing VOCs. For example,
Lamb et al. reported the excellent activity of CuMn2O4 in the oxidation of CO at low temperatures.10 Since then, the superior activity of Mn–Cu oxides
in VOC removal has also been reported. For example, Morales et al.
reported that Mn–Cu oxides successfully catalyzed the oxidation
of ethanol, with complete conversion being achieved at 200 °C.11 Interestingly, the presence of 14 wt % Cu decreased
the crystallinity of the Mn oxides, thereby increasing the catalytic
activity.11 In addition, the poorly-crystalline
structure of Mn–Cu oxides increased the number of oxygen vacancies.
Furthermore, Njagi et al. reported that Mn–Cu oxides prepared
via a redox method removed all of the CO at the ambient temperature.12 These catalysts also exhibit a high catalytic
activity in the oxidation of propane,13 toluene,14 and chlorobenzene,15 and such high catalytic activities can be ascribed
to the presence of Cu2+ + Mn3+ ⇋ Cu+ + Mn4+ redox cycle, which results in the electron
transfer between the Mn and Cu cations.16,17 As the crystalline
phase has an enrichment of Cu+ and Mn4+ on the
surface,16 the redox cycle appears to be
activated to a greater extent in the amorphous phase than in the crystalline
phase.

To date, three models have been proposed for the mechanism
of VOC
oxidation over Mn-based oxides, namely, the Mars–van Krevelen
(MVK) model, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, and the Eley–Rideal
model. For example, Li et al. studied the intrinsic kinetics of the
catalytic combustion of ethylene in a CO2 stream over Mn–Cu
oxide catalysts and showed that the MVK model was consistent with
the intrinsic kinetic experimental data.18 In addition, Sun et al. studied the mechanism of oxidation of toluene
over KMn8O16·nH2O.19 In the absence of atmospheric oxygen
(MVK model), C6H5–CH2 is bonded to the surface oxygen species in KMn8O16·nH2O and toluene
is decomposed. The introduced oxygen vacancy on the surface is supplied
from the bulk oxygen.

However, the detailed mechanism involving
oxygen release from the
hybrid metal oxide and the structural changes taking place in the
VOCs during this transformation remain unclear. It is therefore expected
that an improved understanding of these mechanisms will lead to the
optimization of the structures of Mn–Cu oxides to enhance the
catalytic activity. Thus, we herein report the use of in situ surface
analysis to examine the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. More
specifically, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy
will be carried out in an ultrahigh-vacuum system, as atmospheric
oxygen can be immediately introduced into the Mn–Cu oxides
following the release of oxygen. We will also compare the catalytic
activities of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO catalysts
in the reaction with PGMEA using in situ NEXAFS experiments. In addition,
the position of the oxygen released from MnO2–CuO
will be estimated by calculating the energies for oxygen release in
various positions of MnO2–CuO and comparing the
obtained and simulated NEXAFS spectra. Structural changes of the decomposed
VOCs on the MnO2–CuO catalyst will also be revealed.

Results
and Discussion
Examination of the morphologies of the MnO2 and MnO2–CuO catalysts by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence
of aggregates consisting of numerous nanostructured particles measuring
approximately 10 nm (Figure 1a–d). In addition, the electron diffraction patterns
of the TEM image take the form of broad halos (Figure 1c,d), indicating that these catalysts contain
an amorphous phase. Furthermore, in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
pattern of MnO2 (Figure 1e), three peaks at 2θ = 20, 37, and 66°
were observed. More specifically, the peak at 2θ = 20°
originated from the glass holder, whereas the broad peaks at 2θ
= 37 and 66° originated from the MnO2 spacing in an
octahedral arrangement, thereby indicating the presence of an amorphous
MnO2 phase.20 Although it has
been reported that highly-crystalline MnO2 forms through
calcination of the precipitated MnO2 above 400 °C,21 calcination of the MnO2 and MnO2–CuO catalysts was carried out at 200 °C, as the
amorphous and porous MnO2 exhibits a high catalytic activity
in the decomposition of VOCs.21−23 In this case, the Mn/Cu ratio
was estimated to be 25.5:6.3 from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results (Figure S1, Supporting Information
(SI)), and so no peaks originating from CuO were detected due to the
low Cu content (Figure 1e). Although the crystal phases of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO were not estimated from the PXRD patterns, the Raman
spectra of both MnO2 and MnO2–CuO contain
a peak at 647 cm–1, which corresponds to β-MnO2 (Figure 1f).24 In the case of MnO2–CuO, no
CuO peak was detected at 626 cm–1,25 which is consistent with the PXRD result. In addition,
to estimate the dispersion state of Cu in Mn, energy-dispersive spectrometry
was conducted for bulk analysis, and the Mn/Cu ratio was calculated
to be 24.6:5.9, which is similar to the value obtained using XPS,
thereby indicating that CuO is dispersed homogeneously in MnO2.

MnO2–CuO catalysts.

Table 1 shows
the
pore properties of the synthesized MnO2 and MnO2–CuO samples, including the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas, pore volumes, and pore diameters. The large BET
surface areas (388–398 m2 g–1),
pore volumes (0.33–0.35 cm3 g–1), and pore diameters (3.34–3.65 nm) of these samples originate
from their amorphous structures (Figure 1a–e), which contain both micropores
(Table 1) and mesopores
(Figure S2, SI). In addition, as the pore
properties of these two samples are comparable, these properties can
be ignored when addressing the different catalytic reactivities of
the two samples later in the discussion.

Table 1 Pore Properties
of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO

pore volume (cm3 g–1)	0.33	0.35	
pore diameter (nm)	3.34	3.65	
The oxygen release
performance of each catalyst was then estimated
by measuring the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) (Figure 2a,b), as this is
an important factor in the decomposition of VOCs. The reduction process
was initiated at 118 and 91 °C for MnO2 and MnO2–CuO, respectively, and major reduction peaks were
observed at 253 and 202 °C for the MnO2 and MnO2–CuO catalysts, respectively. In addition, the peak
at 285 °C observed for MnO2 could be attributed to
the bulk MnO2 species, whereas the peak at 253 °C
originated from the surface MnO2. Similarly, the peaks
at 247 and 284 °C in the MnO2–CuO sample could
be attributed to the surface and the bulk, respectively, thereby indicating
that any MnO2 interacting with the Cu species could be
reduced at lower temperatures than pure MnO2. A similar
result has been reported previously for the CuO–NiO samples.26 These results indicate that MnO2–CuO
releases oxygen at lower temperatures than does MnO2. In
addition, Figure 2c
shows the catalytic activities for the oxidation of PGMEA over MnO2 and MnO2–CuO, where it is clear that MnO2–CuO exhibited a higher activity than MnO2. More specifically, the T90 values for
MnO2 and MnO2–CuO were 202 and 171 °C,
respectively, where T90 is the temperature
at which 90% PGMEA conversion is achieved.

MnO2 and MnO2–CuO
and (c) catalytic activities of the catalysts in the conversion of
PGMEA.

To determine the surface chemical
states of MnO2 and
MnO2–CuO before reaction with PGMEA, XPS analysis
was carried out (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3a, the Mn 2p spectrum of the synthesized MnO2 exhibits
a separation of 11.8 eV between the Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 peaks, indicating that the oxidation state is Mn4+ (Figure 3a).27 In addition, the Mn 2p spectrum (Figure 3a) of the synthesized MnO2–CuO sample exhibits a separation of 11.5 eV, which
suggests that the average oxidation states of Mn in MnO2 and MnO2–CuO are different. Furthermore, the Cu
2p spectrum (Figure 3b) of MnO2–CuO exhibits a separation of 19.8 eV
between the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks. In
addition to the presence of two satellite peaks at 962.6 and 944.4
eV, these results confirm that the oxidation state is Cu2+.28 A more detailed estimation of the
oxidation state of Cu was conducted by the calculation of the peak
area ratio between the Cu satellite peak and the Cu 2p1/2 peak (Figure S3, SI).

Figure 3 XPS spectra of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO.
(a) Mn 2p spectra. (b) Cu 2p spectrum of MnO2–CuO.
(c) Mn 3s spectra.

The oxidation states
of Mn in the synthesized MnO2 and
MnO2–CuO samples were then estimated from the Mn
2p and Mn 3s spectra in detail. The peak maximum in the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum of MnO2 (642.9 eV) shifted to 642.6
eV in the spectrum of MnO2–CuO (Figure 3a). In addition, the full width
at half-maximum of the peak in the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum of
MnO2 (2.42 eV) was smaller than that of the MnO2–CuO sample (2.72 eV) (Figure 3a). These results indicate that small quantities of
Mn2+ and Mn3+ exist in MnO2–CuO.
In addition, the presence of reduced Mn in MnO2–CuO
was confirmed by the Mn 3s spectrum upon consideration of the separation
between the two main peaks. More specifically, a separation of 4.8
eV for MnO2 (Figure 3c) indicates an oxidation state of Mn4+,29 whereas a 5.2 eV separation for MnO2–CuO indicates the reduction of Mn,29 which proceeds due to a decrease in the number of oxygen atoms in
Mn–O in the presence of Cu2+.

Thus, to estimate the variation in MnO2 and MnO2–CuO chemical states following the reaction with PGMEA,
in situ NEXAFS experiments were conducted. Figure 4a shows the obtained in situ NEXAFS Mn L3-edge spectra of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO
prior to the reaction, where five peaks originating from Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ can be clearly distinguished,30 thereby confirming a complex multiplet electronic
structure containing Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+. In addition, the observation that MnO2–CuO
was reduced to a greater extent than MnO2 (Figure 4a) corresponded with the XPS
result (Figure 3a,c).
Furthermore, Figure 4b shows the obtained Mn L3-edge spectra of MnO2 before and after the reaction with PGMEA at 150 °C for 30 min,
and it is apparent that no change in the chemical state of Mn in MnO2 was observed. However, following the reaction of MnO2–CuO with PGMEA at 150 °C (Figure 4c), reduction was confirmed, which corresponds
with the results from the catalytic activity experiments (Figure 2c).

Figure 4 (a) Mn L3-edge
spectra of MnO2 and MnO2–CuO before reaction

and after reaction with PGMEA

and after reaction with PGMEA at 150 °C for 30 min. (e) Schematic
diagrams of the Mn 3d levels of Mn4+ and Mn3+.

Figure 4d shows
the obtained O K-edge spectra for MnO2–CuO before
and after reaction with PGMEA at 150 °C for 30 min. The peaks
observed between 530 and 535 eV correspond to the transition from
O 1s to the mixing bands of O 2p and Mn 3d.31 The peaks originating from CuO were not assigned due to the small
quantity of CuO present in the sample. As shown, prior to the reaction,
three peaks were observed, i.e., a1, a2, and a3, which originate from
the transition from O 1s to eg-up, t2g-down,
and eg-down, respectively (Figure 4d).31 However,
after the reaction with PGMEA, only two peaks (i.e., b1 and b2) were
observed, with b1 corresponding to the transition to eg-up and b2 being a hybrid peak composed of the t2g-down
and eg-down peaks. These changes can be explained using
a schematic diagram of the Mn4+ and Mn3+ energy
levels, such as that shown in Figure 4e. For example, the eg-up level was unoccupied
in the Mn4+ energy level, but the eg-up level
was occupied by a single electron in the Mn3+ energy level.
This occupation therefore decreases the probability of a transition
from O 1s to eg-up, whereas the probability of a transition
from O 1s to t2g-down and eg-down was increased.
Thus, the intensity of peak a1 was greater than that of peak b1, whereas
the intensity of peak b2 was greater than that of peaks a2 and a3
due to reaction with PGMEA. These results indicate that a partial
change in the chemical state from Mn4+ to Mn3+ occurred during the reaction with PGMEA. We also estimated the change
in state of Mn at 250 °C (Figure S4, SI) and found that both MnO2 and MnO2–CuO
were reduced, with the degree of reduction increasing with increasing
reaction time.

The position of oxygen release from MnO2–CuO
during the reaction with PGMEA at 150 °C was then estimated by
calculating the energies required for oxygen release from the various
positions of the MnO2–CuO structure (Figure 5a). For the model structure
of MnO2–CuO, approximately 20% of Mn in β-MnO2 is replaced by Cu (Figure 5a), as indicated by the Mn/Cu ratio of 25.5:6.3 estimated
from the XPS results (Figure S1, SI). The
three types of oxygen atom bonded to two neighboring Mn or Cu atoms
were labeled as O(2)-A, O(2)-B, and O(2)-C vacancies, whereas the
two types of oxygen atom bonded to three neighboring Mn or Cu atoms
were labeled as O(3)-A and O(3)-B vacancies. The obtained energies
were as follows: O(2)-A (0.23 eV), O(2)-B (1.14 eV), O(2)-C (1.07
eV), O(3)-A (2.43 eV), and O(3)-B (1.01 eV). In addition, the energy
required for oxygen release from MnO2 was calculated to
be 1.04 eV, which indicates that oxygen bonded to Cu (i.e., Mn–O–Cu), which is an O(2)-A vacancy in the top layer
of MnO2–CuO, is the energetically most favorable
site for oxygen release (0.23 eV).

Twenty percent of Mn in β-MnO2 is replaced by Cu.
(b) Simulated Mn L3-edge spectra of MnO2–CuO
and MnO2–CuO (O(2)-A vacancy). (c) Simulated O K-edge
spectra of MnO2–CuO and MnO2–CuO
(O(2)-A vacancy). The spectra of MnO2–CuO were obtained
using the structure shown in (a). The spectra of MnO2–CuO
(O(2)-A vacancy) were obtained after introducing an O(2)-A vacancy
into the structure shown in (a).

To clarify the structures of these materials, their spectra
were
simulated computationally.32 Thus, the
simulated spectra shown in Figure 5 were obtained before and after the introduction of
an O(2)-A vacancy into the structure of MnO2–CuO
(Figure 5a). The photon
energy of the simulated spectra was calibrated based on the peak value
of the experimental measurement. Unlike the experimental results,
the simulated spectra exhibited sharper peaks due to the crystalline
structures (Figure 5b,c). However, in the simulated Mn L3-edge spectra (Figure 5b), the differences
observed were similar to those of the experimentally obtained spectra
(Figure 4c), in which
the intensities of the peaks originating from Mn3+ and
Mn4+ decreased upon the introduction of an O(2)-A vacancy.
Similarly, the simulated O K-edge spectra (Figure 5c) exhibited spectral changes similar to
those obtained experimentally (Figure 4d), confirming that the position of oxygen release
was indeed Mn–O–Cu. Calculations
of the NEXAFS spectra were also performed for two less stable models
containing oxygen vacancies at the O(2)-B and O(2)-C positions (Figure S5). As indicated, the Mn L-edge and O
K-edge NEXAFS spectra differed slightly depending on the position
of oxygen defect formation. Thus, in combination with the above results,
it is expected that oxygen defects will occur mainly at the O(2)-A
position, and that oxygen will participate in the reaction as indicated
in our proposed mechanism.

Finally, the mechanism for PGMEA
decomposition on MnO2–CuO at 150 °C was estimated
by in situ C K-edge NEXAFS
experiments. Figure 6a shows the structure of PGMEA, which contains two different oxygen-containing
functional groups, namely, lactone and ether groups, which contain
no C=C bonds. Figure 6b,c shows the in situ C K-edge NEXAFS spectra obtained for
MnO2 and MnO2–CuO following the reaction
with PGMEA at 150 °C for 5 and 30 min. In these spectra, the
signals at 285 and 292 eV correspond to the C=C π* and
C–C π* functionalities,33 whereas
the peak at 288 eV can be attributed to C=O π* and C–O
π*.33 As the MnO2 and
MnO2–CuO catalysts were prepared using KMnO4 precursor, two peaks at 298 and 300 eV originating from the
potassium L3 and L2 edges were present.33 In the spectra obtained for the MnO2 catalysts reacted with PGMEA at 150 °C for 5 and 30 min (Figure 6b), no changes were
observed upon increasing the reaction time, thereby indicating that
PGMEA adsorption had no effect on its structure. A similar tendency
was observed for the Mn L3-edge spectra of MnO2 (Figure 4b). However,
for the MnO2–CuO catalyst, the PGMEA structure was
altered upon increasing the reaction time (Figure 6b). More specifically, in the spectra shown
in Figure 6b, the intensities
of the peaks originating from C=O π* and C–O π*
decrease, whereas that of the peak corresponding to C=C π*
increase. These results indicate that PGMEA was decomposed by the
oxygen of the MnO2–CuO catalyst, resulting in the
breakdown of lactone and ether functional groups and the formation
of C=C bonds.

Conclusions
To investigate the effect of Cu addition to
a MnO2 catalyst
on the decomposition of propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA),
MnO2 (398 m2 g–1) and MnO2–CuO (388 m2 g–1) catalysts
with similar specific surface areas were synthesized and the catalytic
process was investigated. We found that the catalytic activity of
MnO2–CuO was higher than that of MnO2, where the T90 values for MnO2 and MnO2–CuO were 202 and 171 °C, respectively.
These results corresponded with the calculated results for the oxygen
release energy for both MnO2 (1.04 eV) and MnO2–CuO (0.23 eV). Calculations also confirmed that oxygen is
released from the Mn–O–Cu position on the top layer
of the MnO2–CuO structure. Furthermore, the obtained
in situ near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra
indicated that the chemical state of the Mn present in MnO2 was not altered following PGMEA dosing at 150 °C, whereas the
Mn present in MnO2–CuO did react with PGMEA. The
spectral changes observed in the obtained NEXAFS spectrum of MnO2–CuO correlated well with the simulated NEXAFS spectrum
following oxygen release from the Mn–O–Cu site. Finally,
the reaction of MnO2–CuO with PGMEA promoted the
decomposition of the lactone and ether functional groups in PGMEA,
whereas the formation of C=C bonds was observed. This improved
understanding of the decomposition mechanism should lead to the optimization
of the structures of Mn–Cu oxides to ultimately enhance the
catalytic activity.

Experimental Section
Catalysts
MnO2 with a specific surface area
of 398 m2 g–1 (Table 1) was synthesized from a mixture of aqueous
solutions of KMnO4 (≥99.0%, Samchun Chemical Co.,
Ltd.) and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (≥99.9%,
Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.). More specifically, an aqueous solution
of KMnO4 was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O in a 2:3 molar ratio.
The precipitation of MnO2 then took place according to
the reaction outlined in eq 1 1  After stirring the solution for 3 h at 25
°C, the suspension was filtered and the precipitate washed with
ultrapure water until a neutral pH was achieved. The obtained product
was then dried at 80 °C for 24 h prior to calcination at 200
°C for 24 h.

MnO2–CuO with a specific
surface area of 388 m2 g–1 (Table 1) was synthesized
by the addition of an aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (≥99.0%, Junsei Chemical Co.,
Ltd.) to an aqueous solution of the previously prepared MnO2 in a Mn/Cu molar ratio of 4:1. Precipitation, filtration, washing,
drying, and calcination of the MnO2–CuO catalyst
were carried out according to the above procedure for MnO2.

Catalytic Activity Measurements
The catalytic activities
of the prepared MnO2 and MnO2–CuO catalysts
were evaluated in the total oxidation of PGMEA in a fixed-bed flow
reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst powders were pressed,
crushed, and sieved to a size of 18–20 mesh (0.84–1.00
mm), and PGMEA vapor was fed into the reactor by adding a mixture
of PGMEA (200 ppm) and O2 gas at a total flow rate of 2500
cm3 min–1. The gas hourly space velocity
was set at 10 000 h–1, and the PGMEA conversion
was estimated using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector (Agilent 6890N, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd.).

Characterization
The pore properties of the catalysts
were measured by N2 adsorption at −196 °C (TriStar
II 3020, Micromeritics Instrument Corp.). Prior to the measurements,
each catalyst was outgassed at 150 °C for 2 h. The morphologies
of the catalyst samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM; S4800, Hitachi Ltd.) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
Titan G2 80-200, FEI). For the TEM observations, each catalyst was
observed at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The crystalline structures
of the catalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD;
SmartLab, Rigaku Co.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542
nm) and by Raman spectroscopy (NRS 3200, JASCO Co.) with a 532 nm
laser. The reduction temperatures of the catalysts were then determined
by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements between 25
and 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. A mixture of H2/N2 (1:9) was introduced over
the catalyst sample in a quartz tube at a rate of 10 cm3 min–1 and at ambient pressure. The quantity of
H2 consumed in the reduction of the sample was monitored
using a thermal conductivity detector. The surface chemical states
were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCALAB
250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). XPS analysis was conducted
using an Al Kα X-ray gun at 10 mA and 15 kV and with a pass
energy of 10 eV. The flood gun was used as a charge neutralizer. The
C 1s peaks (285 eV) of the catalyst XPS spectra were used for calibrating
the binding energy values. All of the maximum intensities of the Mn
2p spectra were adjusted to 1.0, and the intensities of the other
spectra were normalized.

Changes in the surface chemical states
after reaction with PGMEA were subsequently analyzed by in situ NEXAFS
at the 8A2 undulator beamline of the Pohang Light Source in the Pohang
Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. The partial electron yield detection
mode was used for the NEXAFS spectra by recording the sample current
normalized to a signal current measured simultaneously using a gold
mesh in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). A P-polarized synchrotron photon
beam (∼85%) with an energy of 630–665 eV for the Mn
L-edge spectra, 520–565 eV for the O K-edge spectra, and 270–320
eV for the C K-edge spectra was employed. In addition, the probing
depth was ∼50 Å for surface-sensitive measurements and
the spectral energy resolution (ΔE) was 0.1
eV. All of the NEXAFS experiments were carried out in a UHV chamber,
which was connected to a preparation chamber with a gas-dosing system.
The NEXAFS spectra of the MnO2 and MnO2–CuO
samples were measured before and after dosing with gaseous PGMEA.
Each catalyst was loaded in the preparation chamber and heated at
200 °C for 30 min to remove any surface impurities. The samples
were then cooled to room temperature and the NEXAFS spectra recorded.
To estimate the changes in the surface chemical states after reaction
with PGMEA, the samples were first heated at 150 °C for 30 min,
then exposed to gaseous PGMEA for either 5 or 30 min, and the NEXAFS
spectra were recorded. The pressure of the chamber was increased from
2.0 × 10–8 to 9 × 10–6 Torr during PGMEA dosing. The maximum intensities of all of the
peaks in the Mn L3-edge spectra originating from Mn2+ were adjusted equally, and the intensities of the other
spectra were normalized.

of our NEXAFS experiments, we calculated the theoretical NEXAFS spectra
using the plane-wave density functional theory code CASTEP of the
Materials Studio 8.0 software suite. The surface structures of the
MnO2-based catalysts, namely, MnO2 and MnO2–CuO, were taken from the β-MnO2 (110)
surface. Their surface structures and energies were then determined
using the generalized gradient approximation functional of PBESol
with a plane wave cutoff of 500 eV. A 6 × 6 × 9 k-point mesh in the Brillouin zone was applied for appropriate
scaling of the supercells.

Theoretical calculations of the NEXAFS
spectra employ a “core–hole” pseudopotential,
which is generated by removing half an electron from the 1s state
of an atom during pseudopotential generation.34−37 In the CASTEP calculation process,
ultrasoft pseudopotentials were generated on the fly when performing
core–hole calculations.38,39 However, a pseudopotential
code is not appropriate to describe the core-excited state, as the
wavefunctions of the valence and conduction bands can only be described
as pseudowave functions rather than all-electron wavefunctions in
the general plane-wave pseudopotential code. Hence, a projector-augmented
wave reconstruction is used in the CASTEP process to reduce the pseudopotential
error, although little deviation from the spectra generated using
an all-electron code was observed.35
