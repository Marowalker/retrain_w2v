A variety
of arenes and heteroarenes are brominated in good to
excellent yields using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) under
mild and practical conditions. According to mechanistic investigations
described within, the reaction is speculated to proceed via activation
of NBS through a visible-light photoredox pathway utilizing erythrosine
B as a photocatalyst. A photo-oxidative approach effectively amplifies
the positive polarization on the bromine atom of the NBS reagent.
This increase in the electrophilic nature of NBS results in drastically
reduced reaction times and diversion from competing light-promoted
reactive pathways.

Introduction
Aryl bromides are found
as valuable end-targets in a variety of
synthetic applications including pharmaceuticals, natural products,
agrochemicals, and advanced materials (Figure 1).1−3 In addition, brominated arenes
function as important precursors in a variety of synthetic transformations
including SNAr-type halogen displacements4 and cross-coupling reactions (Suzuki–Miyaura,5 Heck,6 Stille,7 Sonogashira,8 and
Buchwald–Hartwig9,10).

Figure 1 Representative examples
of pharmaceutical compounds containing
aryl bromide functionality.

Because of the ubiquity of these synthetic building blocks,
the
predictable and selective installation of bromine into aromatic scaffolds
under mild and practical reaction conditions has received constant
attention from the synthetic community. Traditionally, bromination
of arenes is accomplished through pathways that include Friedel–Crafts-type
electrophilic aromatic halogenation,11,12 organometallic-mediated
or transition metal-catalyzed approaches,1,13 or
Sandmeyer-type reactions of diazonium salts.14 The most convenient and popular approach, electrophilic aromatic
halogenation, typically involves either the use of elemental bromine
under harsh conditions, an electrophilic “Br+”
species (including N-halo reagents), or a source of anionic bromide
in conjunction with a potentially hazardous and/or corrosive oxidizing
agent.11,12,15−19N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) is a widely used example
of an N-halo brominating agent because of its practicality, low cost,
and relative stability. Within the family of N-halosuccinimides,
NBS is a more reactive electrophilic halogen source than either N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N-iodosuccinimide
and can be used to brominate highly electron-rich aromatics under
relatively mild conditions in polar solvents.20−22 Although NBS
is more reactive in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions
than analogous succinimide reagents, it is also more capricious with
regard to reaction conditions. Long reaction times may be required
because of precautions (dark environments, low temperatures) that
are necessary to discourage other competing light-activated, radical
pathways (including radical oxybromination at benzylic positions and
C–H bonds α to a ketone carbonyl).18,19,23 In addition, for aromatic substrates that
are less electron-rich, activation of the N-halosuccinimide
reagent by an external acid may be required. In such an example, a
strong Bronsted or Lewis acid is used to coordinate the O atom of
the succinimide, which draws the electron density away from the halogen,
thus amplifying the electrophilicity of the halogen by increasing
the N–X bond polarization (Scheme 1, Path A).24−27

Scheme 1 General Scheme of
Traditional Acidic Activation of NBS and Oxidative
Activation by Photoredox Catalysis (PC = Photocatalyst; SET = Single
Electron Transfer)
As an alternative approach to electrophilic amplification
via acidic
activation, we have found inspiration in recent reports in which halogenating
reagents are activated under visible-light photoredox catalysis (VLPC)
conditions.28−32 König’s Ru(II)-catalyzed photoredox approach to NCS
activation relies upon the oxidation of an N-chloro reagent to produce
an activated cationic N-radical, thus inducing strong positive polarization
(δ+) that amplifies the electrophilicity of the halogen
atom.29 The use of a similar VLPC approach
toward bromination would offer a mild catalytic alternative for N-bromo
reagent activation without the requirement of an external acid (Scheme 1, Path B). Therefore,
in following our research group’s interest in developing synthetic
methodologies that utilize N-centered radical species,33−42 we turned our attention toward the production of a cationic N-radical
species from NBS using a visible-light photoredox catalyst.

VLPC has attracted intense attention from the synthetic community
as a mild means of initiating transformations involving electron-transfer
pathways.43−46 In the recent expansion in the field of VLPC, the majority of synthetic
applications have been dominated by the use of transition metal complexes
such as Ru(II) and Ir(III) bipyridyl complexes. Transition metal complexes
offer the ability to electronically tune a complex by control of the
coordinating ligand and are generally well-understood with regard
to electrochemical, kinetic, and spectroscopic information.43,45 However, these widely employed transition metal complexes may require
synthesis or are costly if commercially available. As an attractive
complement to metal-catalyzed VLPC systems, a number of organic dyes
have been shown to exhibit efficient, and in some cases, superior
reactivity to the transition metal catalysts at a fraction of the
cost.44,47−54 To date, the majority of organic dyes employed as visible-light
photocatalysts for synthetic applications belong to the azine (methylene
blue), acridinium (9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium salts), quinone (DDQ),
or xanthene (eosin Y, erythrosine B, and rose bengal) structural classes
(Figure 2).44

Figure 2 Selected examples of organic dye visible-light photoredox
catalysts.

Herein, we report a new pathway
for mild, electrophilic bromination
of arenes and heteroarenes that utilizes the organic dye, erythrosine
B, as a visible-light photoredox catalyst to amplify the electrophilicity
of NBS. The method complements existing strategies and offers practical
advantages in examples in which either nonacidic activation of NBS
or the prevention of byproducts from unwanted light-promoted radical
pathways is desired.

Results and Discussion
To begin
our investigation, a representative aromatic substrate
(naphthalene 1) was selected for bromination using NBS 2, and a number of organic dyes were screened as catalysts.
Initial settings were chosen that offered operationally convenient
and practical conditions (ambient temperature, open to air, 24 h).
To our delight, several catalysts promoted the formation of 1-bromonaphthalene 3 more effectively than the uncatalyzed background reaction
(Table 1).

From the results of the screening, erythrosine B was
selected as
the most efficient catalyst for production of 1-bromonaphthalene 3. Erythrosine B is a member of the xanthene family of dyes
and is widely used as a food colorant (FD&C Red no. 3) and painting
ink, but thus far, the chemical applications of erythrosine B have
remained remarkably limited55−62 relative to other xanthene dyes such as eosin Y, fluorescein, and
rose bengal.

Employing erythrosine B as a VLPC catalyst, a series
of experiments
were conducted to develop an optimized set of reaction conditions
(Table 2). First, the
stoichiometric ratio of naphthalene and NBS substrate was examined
(Table 2, entries 1–3).
An excess of brominating agent had little to no effect on the product
yield, so a 1:1 ratio of NBS/naphthalene was chosen for further experiments.
The catalyst loading of erythrosine B was then investigated (entries
4–10). A low catalyst concentration is necessary to achieve
full conversion as the catalyst is deactivated under a high concentration,
which may be due to radical collisional quenching.63 Next, a survey of solvents and reaction concentrations
was conducted (entries 11–16). It was observed that [1.7 mM]
of erythrosine B in acetonitrile was optimal for the reaction conditions
(entry 16). The use of an external oxidizing agent such as oxone (entry
17) had little effect on the reaction. However, when ammonium peroxodisulfate
was added to the reaction mixture, a considerable increase in the
rate of the reaction was observed (entries 18–20). Full conversion
of naphthalene was observed using 1.1 equivalents of NBS; therefore,
entry 19 represents the optimized conditions for the reaction.

A series of control reactions were conducted, and the results are
displayed in Table 3. Light plays a key role in the reaction, as exhibited by the substantial
decrease in product formation when the reaction is performed in the
dark (Table 3, entry
3; Table 4, entry 5).
Though ammonium peroxodisulfate is an important component in the promotion
of the reaction, it is not solely responsible for activation of NBS,
as observed in entries 3–5. The exclusion of catalytic erythrosine
B results in a significant decrease in the formation of 3 (entries 4 and 5). In addition, oxygen (air) appears to serve as
an oxidizing agent throughout the duration of the reaction. Ammonium
peroxodisulfate can be used as a stoichiometric oxidant in the absence
of O2 (entry 6), but when no oxidant (such as (NH4)2S2O8 or O2) was present
(entry 7), the reaction was severely impacted, resulting in a 7% yield.
Finally, known radical inhibitors BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and
TEMPO were separately tested under standard reaction conditions to
determine if the presence of a radical intermediate might exist in
the potential mechanistic pathway, and in both examples, product formation
was completely halted (entries 8 and 9).

The source of light in the activation of NBS by erythrosine B was
then investigated (Table 4). Ammonium peroxodisulfate was excluded from the reaction
to eliminate the background production of brominated arene, as observed
in the control reactions shown in Table 3. The absorption maximum (λab) of the ground state of erythrosine B is approximately 530 nm in
acetonitrile. As shown in Table 3, the use of blue LED resulted in a moderately reduced
yield, whereas utilization of a green or red LED light chamber had
a severely detrimental effect on the reaction. The use of a white
LED photochamber (see Supporting Information for description) displayed the most efficient production of 1-bromonaphthalene 3 and was used for all subsequent studies.

Following
the optimization of reaction conditions (1 equiv arene,
1.1 equiv NBS, 0.1 equiv (NH4)2S2O8, 0.01 equiv erythrosine B [0.0017 M], acetonitrile,
white LED, air), an exploration of the substrate scope was conducted
with respect to the arene reagent (Table 5). In addition to naphthalene, several other
arene substrates see dramatic enhancement in both the rate of reaction
and the yield of brominated product upon use of catalytic erythrosine
B. When 2-methylnaphthalene was employed in the absence of a catalyst,
no conversion of arene was observed in 10 min by 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. After 2 h, a complex mixture
was obtained containing products of benzylic bromination (see the Supporting Information for 1H NMR
spectra). In the presence of erythrosine B, however, 2-methylnaphthalene
was cleanly converted to 4 within 10 min with no trace
of benzylic functionalization. This example illustrates the potential
utility of the photocatalyzed system. By oxidizing NBS and increasing
the electrophilicity of the bromine atom, a photoredox approach appears
to divert a potential side reaction (light-promoted radical bromination
of benzylic C–H bonds) to a more reactive electrophilic aromatic
bromination (Br+) pathway.

e Inseparable mixture of isomers.

Bromination of anisole occurred
in a quantitative fashion according
to 1H NMR, with the para-substituted isomer being the only
observable product (5). The substituted anisole derivative,
4′-methoxyacetophenone, was also efficiently brominated on
the aromatic ring with no observable bromination occurring alpha to
ketone (6). A variety of aryl ether-containing substrates
as well as phenol derivatives were examined (7–14). In examples where a mixture of mono- and dibromination occurred,
2.2 equivalents of NBS was employed to produce a dibrominated major
product. Aniline derivatives (15 and 16)
along with acetanilide (17) and the anesthetic, lidocaine
(18), performed well under the photocatalyzed conditions.
Electron-deficient arenes such as chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene were
unsuccessful under the optimized reaction conditions. Additionally,
aldehyde functionality is not tolerated under the reaction conditions,
as 4-methoxybenzaldehyde was oxidized to the carboxylic acid when
tested. Arenes that contain electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl,
nitro, and halide) are tolerated as long as they are accompanied by
an electron-donating group on the aromatic ring. It is noteworthy
that, despite the reactions being conducted in a visible-light photochamber,
brominated byproducts were not observed in any example using an arene
that contained benzylic C–H bonds (4, 11, 12, and 18) or C–H bonds α
to carbonyls (6, 17, 18).

In addition to the variety of brominated arenes shown in Table 5, a series of N-containing
heteroarenes were cleanly brominated and are displayed in Table 6. In general, good
to excellent yields of brominated products were obtained with high
regioselectivity. Heteroarenes that were employed include pyrrole,
pyrazole, indole, and indazole cores along with bioactive compounds
such as caffeine and the painkiller phenazone. Bromination at the N-methyl position of phenazone was an observed minor product
with 21. Products of N-methyl bromination
were not observed, however, when using caffeine as a substrate.

a Conditions: 1 equiv heteroarene,
1.1 equiv NBS, 0.1 equiv (NH4)2S2O8, 0.01 equiv erythrosine B [0.0017M], MeCN, air, 20
°C, white LED. All yields are isolated.

To investigate whether the oxidation potential of
NBS was within
the range of the photocatalyst erythrosine B, the cyclic voltammograms
of NBS and erythrosine B were obtained versus Fc/Fc+ (see
the Supporting Information). The fluorescence
emission profile of erythrosine B exhibits a peak with a maximum at
568 nm (λem), which correlates with a Eoo value of 2.18 eV. The Stokes shift (Δλ)
of erythrosine B is therefore calculated as 38 nm (λem 568 nm – λab 530 nm). This relatively large
Stokes shift value for a xanthene dye (most are 20–35 nm) might
be attributed to an excited-state intramolecular charge transfer.64−66 On the basis of the redox potentials obtained, the oxidation of
NBS (+0.28 vs Fc/Fc+) is feasible by the excited state
of erythrosine B; therefore, the catalyst is speculated to proceed
through a reductive quenching cycle, as shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Redox Properties
of Erythrosine B
Potentials are given vs Fc/Fc+.

On the basis of the experimental
results, a plausible reaction
mechanism is proposed in Scheme 3. Ammonium peroxodisulfate has been excluded from the
proposed mechanism because it is not a necessary component of the
reaction according to control experiments. The photoexcited state
of erythrosine B can induce oxidation of the nitrogen atom of NBS
to cationic radical species B, thus amplifying the positive
polarization on the bromine atom. Following electrophilic aromatic
bromination with an arene substrate, an external oxidant [such as
O2, (NH4)2S2O8, or H2O2] may serve as the oxidizing agent
to return erythrosine B to its ground state. Alternatively, the resulting
charged succinimide species C could oxidize the reduced
state of the catalytic erythrosine B to form the succinimide anion D.

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
To determine if the superoxide anion O2–• is formed under the photocatalyzed conditions,
the iodide test (NaI
in glacial acetic acid) was performed to attempt to observe the presence
of H2O2 byproduct, which would ultimately result
from the intermediate superoxide anion. Ammonium peroxodisulfate was
intentionally excluded from the reaction mixture to prevent the false
positive test that would result from the oxidation of iodide by (NH4)2S2O8. As shown in Figure 3, upon addition of
the crude reaction mixture at 0 min, the NaI/AcOH mixture appeared
as the orange/red color of the erythrosine B crude reaction. Following
a 2 h reaction period, the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction
mixture was confirmed by the appearance of the dark red/brown color
of I2 (Figure 3, panel F).

Conclusions
A new catalytic mode
of activation of NBS for bromination of arenes
and heteroarenes has been developed using erythrosine B as a visible-light
photoredox catalyst. The reaction operates under mild, practical conditions
and produces brominated arenes in high regioselectivity and in short
reaction times. The approach diverts NBS from competing light-promoted
pathways, such as benzylic bromination, toward electrophilic aromatic
substitution. A variety of substrates were brominated in good to excellent
yields, and many functionalities were tolerated. According to mechanistic
studies, the reaction is speculated to operate via a single electron
oxidation of NBS by erythrosine B, which is in turn oxidized back
to its ground state by air. Finally, attempts to employ a VLPC strategy
to activate additional reagents containing N–X bonds for electrophilic
transformations are currently underway in our laboratory and will
be reported in due course.

General Procedure
To an oven-dried

a magnetic stir bar, erythrosine B (4.4 mg, 0.01 equiv, 0.005 mmol),
ammonium peroxodisulfate (11.4 mg, 0.1 equiv, 0.05 mmol), arene/heteroarene
(1 equiv, 0.5 mmol), acetonitrile (3 mL), and then NBS (98 mg, 1.1
equiv, 0.55 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred open to air at
room temperature (20 °C) in a white LED chamber for the time
specified for each respective arene. Reactions were monitored for
completion by thin-layer chromatography (hexanes/ethyl acetate) and/or
GC. For substrates that produced a mixture of mono- and dibrominated
products upon full conversion, 2.2 equivalents (1.1 mmol) of NBS was
employed. Upon completion of the reaction, the crude mixture was evaporated
under pressure and the brominated product was isolated via column
chromatography on silica gel.
