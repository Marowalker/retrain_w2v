Molecular
imaging has been widely used not only as an important
detection technology in the field of medical imaging for cancer diagnosis
but also as a theranostic approach for cancer in recent years. Multifunctional
carbon-based nanomaterials (MCBNs), characterized by unparalleled
optical, electronic, and thermal properties, have attracted increasing
interest and demonstrably hold the greatest promise in biomolecular
imaging and therapy. As such, it should come as no surprise that MCBNs
have already revealed a great deal of potential applications in biomedical
areas, such as bioimaging, drug delivery, and tumor therapy. Carbon
nanomaterials can be categorized as graphene, single-walled carbon
nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, or carbon
dots on the basis of their morphologies. In this article, reports
of the use of MCBNs in various chemical conjugation/functionalization
strategies, focusing on their applications in cancer molecular imaging
and imaging-guided therapy, will be comprehensively summarized. MCBNs
show the possibility to serve as optimal candidates for precise cancer
biotheranostics.

1 Introduction
Molecular imaging plays
a crucial role in early accurate diagnosis
and therapy for 21st-century cancer management.1 Recently, inorganic nanomaterials (gold nanoparticles,
iron oxide nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles,
etc.) with various unique intrinsic physical properties have attracted
tremendous interest in cancer theranostic (i.e., combined diagnostic
and therapeutic) applications.2−6 To this end, carbon-based nanoparticles have shown great promise
as the next generation of theranostic probes due to their excellent
mechanical, thermal, and optical properties (Figure 1).7,8 Carbon nanoparticles
are mainly categorized as graphene, single-walled carbon nanotubes,
mesoporous carbon, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, or carbon dots.9,10

in cancer.

1.1 Graphene
Graphene
family nanomaterials
(GFNs), without question, are the most extensively studied materials
by virtue of their great number of extraordinary physicochemical
properties.7,11,12 As the world’s strongest, thinnest, and stiffest materials,11 GFNs are characterized by alluring optical characteristics
(e.g., the ability to quench fluorescence),13 a large specific planar surface area (2630 m2 g–1),14 and unparalleled thermal conductivity
(5000 W m–1 K–1).15 GFNs are distinguished mainly on the basis of various chemical
modifications and include graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) (Figure 2).7,16,17 Wherein defect-free
graphene is not commonly used due to the difficulty of its bulk synthesis,
it can be suspended in solutions and isolated in the gas phase on
account of its highly reactive surface, so GO and rGO are widely applied
in biomedical areas. GO, a highly oxidized form of chemically modified
graphene, has many distinct characteristics resulting from the presence
of numerous oxygen-containing hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, and
epoxides in the plane.7,18 In terms of its benefits, GO
possesses colloidal stability and allows surface modification.9,19 Moreover, with the presence of the free surface π electrons
from unoxidized areas of graphene enabling hydrophobic properties,
drug loading by π–π interactions, and non-covalent
functionalization, GO can serve as a surfactant to stabilize hydrophobic
molecules in solution.20 Recent research
has demonstrated that GO can be functionalized by biomolecules (e.g.,
proteins, peptides, small organic molecules, etc.) to enhance unique
physicochemical properties required for specific applications when
compared to the use of either material alone. For example, Zhang et
al. functionalized GO with folic acid (FA) as a cancer-targeting molecule
and loaded doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin onto the large surface
area of GO via π–π stacking.21 Compared with GO, rGO, characterized by lower oxygen content,
weaker surface charge, and poorer hydrophilicity, is capable of higher
light absorption in the visible and infrared regions.17,22−24 This is because the chemical reduction restored part
of the disrupted π conjugation from highly oxidized GO.17 As a result, functionalized graphene composite
nanomaterials are powerful driving forces in the field of bioapplications.

1.2 Single-Walled
Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs)
Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes
by Iijima in 1991,25 they have been rapidly
developed as a platform
for biomedical applications.26 SWNTs are
cylindrical and sp2-hybridized carbon nanomaterials with
nanometer-scale diameters 100–1000 times less than their length,
resulting in very large aspect ratios.6,27 Owing to their
unique structure, SWNTs exhibit intrinsic optical properties (i.e.,
strong resonant Raman scattering28 and
photoluminance in the near-infrared (NIR) range)29,30 that have potential for implementation in bioimaging.31−35 However, composites incorporating SWNTs have not yet been proven
to be competent theranostic agents, mostly because of their poor interaction
with the surrounding matrices, leading to inefficient loading ratio
and instability.9 Therefore, many recent
research efforts have been focused on functionalization of SWNTs for
bioimaging, ranging from single-modal imaging29 to multimodal imaging,36 and even imaging-guided
chemo-photothermal therapy.37,38 By combining these
unique and robust nanomaterials, SWNT–nanoparticle hybrid structures
give access not only to the individual properties of the nanoparticles
but to additional superiorities, such as remarkable biocompatibility
and synergistic properties.

1.3 Mesoporous Carbon Nanoparticles
(MCNs)
Mesoporous nanoparticles, especially mesoporous silica-based
nanoparticles
(MSNs), have been applied in the fields of biotechnology and nanomedicine
due to their high surface area, large pore volume, and uniform mesoporous
structures.39−44 However, MSNs have severe drawbacks, such as tedious surface modification
processes,39 low loading capacity,45 and potential toxicity for in vivo applications.46−48 As such, it is continuously a hot topic to construct an intelligent
nanoporous platform with simultaneous controlled drug release and
diagnostic imaging performance.39 As the
newcomers to the carbon-based family of compounds in nanomedicine,
three-dimensional mesoporous carbon nanoparticles (MCNs) with pore
size in the range 2–50 nm are leading theranostic materials
because of their well-defined nanoporous structures, high pore volume,
and high biocompatibility.39,48−53 Specifically, MCNs-based intelligent multifunctional composite nanosystems
have gradually emerged at the foreground of bioapplications, especially
for serving as intelligent theranostic platforms for stimuli-responsive
drug delivery and molecular imaging.39,49

1.4 Carbon Dots (CDs)
Nanoscale carbon
particles (carbon dots, or CDs), a recently discovered class of carbon
nanomaterials, have drawn much attention due to their unique properties,
such as excellent water solubility and excellent biocompatibility.54−58 Recently, surface-passivated CDs have been reported to exhibit strong
photoluminescence (PL), with spectral features and properties in the
visible spectrum (Figure 3).59,60 CDs that exhibit bright photoluminescence
in the visible region are characterized by two distinctive features:
(1) small size (sub-10 nm) and (2) surface passivation.59,60 Compared with conventional organic dyes and semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs), CDs possess excellent fluorescence properties, such as
high photostability, broad excitation spectra, and tunable emission
spectra.59,61,62 Therefore,
CDs have received special attention in potential applications such
as bioimaging and drug delivery.

wavelengths directly. Reprinted with permission from ref (60). Copyright 2006 American

1.5 Other Carbon-Based Nanomaterials
Nanodiamonds
(NDs), referring to an octahedral architecture ranging
from 5 to 50 nm in size, have seen significant progress in their development
as promising candidates for molecular theranostic applications63−65 due to their exceptional biocompatibility, easy functionalization
versatility, high adsorption capacity, and thermal properties.6,66−68 NDs can produce PL with emission in the red and NIR
spectral regions (575–750 nm) and do not bring about photoquenching,69,70 which typically results from nitrogen vacancy color centers embedded
in a diamond matrix.71,72 In addition to fluorescence properties,
NDs also give access to magnetic properties because of their facet-specific
electrostatics.73 Moreover, NDs can serve
as promising drug carriers due to their unique surface electrostatics.74 With the above-mentioned electrochemical and
optical properties, NDs’ surfaces can be functionalized to
achieve synergistic effects with fluorescent molecules,75−77 DNA,78 siRNA,79 proteins,80,81 lysozyme,82 growth hormone,83 cytochrome c,84 alcohol dehydrogenase,85 antibodies,86,87 anti-cancer
drugs,74,88 and dopamine derivatives.89,90 As such, developing NDs for future theranostic applications has
extensive prospects.91

Fullerenes
(C60), soccer-ball-shaped molecules composed of 12 pentagons
formed by C5–C5 single bonds and 20 hexagons
formed by C5–C6 double bonds, have been
widely studied since their discovery in 1985.92−95 Subsequently, numerous fullerenes
with other carbon numbers (e.g., C70, C76, C80, and so on) have been produced,96−98 wherein the
condensed aromatic rings present in the C60 result in an
extended π-conjugated system of molecular orbitals which produce
significant absorption of visible light.99,100 With the absorption of visible light and efficient intersystem crossing
to a long-lived triplet state, fullerenes can generate reactive oxygen
species upon illumination and so give access to photosensitizers (PSs).101,102 Recently, functionalized C60 has been realized by covalent
attachment with various groups (e.g., −OH, −NH2, −COOH) to make more promising candidates for theranostic
applications.93,101

In this article, we will
systematically discuss the above-described
carbon-based nanomaterials in terms of their functionalization, characterization,
and implementation for a host of theranostic applications. While there
are already numerous excellent reviews focusing on carbon-based nanomaterials’
imaging and cargo delivery, the molecular imaging and imaging-guided
therapy applications of carbon-based nanomaterials have not been comprehensively
reviewed. Moreover, we present the first of effort to combine MCNs
with other carbon-based nanomaterials for perfect carbon-based nanomaterials.
This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the various carbon-based
nanomaterials that have been developed for theranostic applications.

2 Theranostic Application of Multifunctional Carbon-Based
Nanomaterials
2.1 Graphene
2.1.1 Fluorescence Imaging and Therapy
In theoretical and
experimental studies, small graphene (less than
10 nm) can be used as QDs, which can be realized by reducing the connectivity
of the π-electron network to induce a band gap using physical
or chemical methods.103 Recently, graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) have attracted increasing interest for implementation
into bioimaging applications.104 As has
been reported by Zhu et al., GQDs with strong green fluorescence have
been synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method for cellular imaging.105 In addition, GQDs were explored to serve as
a new generation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents.106 The new agents overcame the limitations of
conventional agents, such as low singlet oxygen quantum yields, photobleaching,
and poor biocompatibility. Although GQDs produced a very high singlet
O2 quantum yield, this situation was attained only in the
visible light region and can only offer treatment of near-skin tumors
but not deeply buried tumors. Given these findings, Kalluru et al.
successfully assembled a novel NIR-light-activatable theranostic platform
based on GQDs (Figure 4A).107 It was demonstrated that nano-GO-PEG-FA
sensitized the generation of singlet O2 to mediate bimodal
PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) effects on effective damage to
solid tumors even in deep tissues under ultra-low laser doses of NIR
light excitation. Moreover, nano-GO-PEG-FA can exhibit wavelength-dependent
PL under NIR light excitation, so it is suitable for in vivo deep
fluorescence imaging (Figure 4B). In view of these advantages, more GQDs-based theranostic
platforms will be widely explored for fluorescence-guided therapy.

and photodynamic therapeutic destruction of tumors. (B) In vivo fluorescence
imaging from PBS (left) and GO-PEG-folate (right) mice at 24 h after
intravenous injection. Reprinted from ref (107). Copyright 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to serving as QDs, graphene can also
act as a carrier
for other QDs or dyes to reduce their adverse effects and enhance
their properties. As such, a great number of studies on dye/QDs-labeled
graphene nanocomposites for fluorescence imaging have also been conducted.
On one hand, Gao et al. developed a thermo-activatable hybrid nanocomplex,
called CPGA, by conjugating a NIR dye (Cy5.5)-labeled matrix metalloproteinase-14
(MMP-14) substrate (CP) onto the GO/Au complex (GA),108 wherein the Cy5.5 fluorescent signal is quenched by surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) capacity from GA, yet it can boost stronger
fluorescence signals after separation from GA. Compared to the other
activatable fluorescent probes, CPGA had prominent quenching efficiency
(95%), which gives it remarkable promise for future development of
intelligent nanoplatforms. In another study, Cy5.5-labeled molecular
beacon (MB) was conjugated onto GO by π–π stacking
interactions for highly sensitive detection and imaging of miRNAs.109 GO can induce efficient fluorescence quenching
of the dyes on MB. When the Cy5.5-MB target molecule reacted with
the miRNAs to form a duplex, it was released from the GO surface and
restored the fluorescence of one dye molecule in living cells and
in vivo. On the other hand, to prevent fluorescence quenching, Hu
et al. used a surfactant coating method to synthesize a hybrid nanocomposite
of core–shell CdSe/ZnS QDs and rGO.110 In addition to reducing the toxicity of QDs, the nanocomposite also
preserved thier fluorescence characteristics by maintaining a suitable
spacer between the QDs and rGO (Figure 5). Meanwhile, the QDs also acted as an optical indicator
for the PTT effect by degradation resulting from the thermal effect
on the irradiated rGO.

2.1.2 Raman Imaging and Therapy
Raman
scattering is a photon scattering process in which photons’
emission wavelengths are shifted under light excitation rather than
PL.111−113 When the laser energy reaches the desired
value, required for electron transition from the valence band to the
conduction band, the generated signal reflects “resonance Raman
scattering”.114,115 Typically, GO can be characterized
by Raman spectroscopy on the basis of its distinctive Raman spectra
(D band at 1350 cm–1 and G band at 1600 cm–1).116 However, the inherent Raman scattering
signals of GO itself are usually weak. Recently, GO was modified with
noble metals (e.g., Au and Ag) to promote its Raman intensity and
sensitivity, which is referred to as surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS).116,117 Liu et al. decorated Au/GO hybrids that
could serve as a flexible Raman probe for bioimaging applications
through Raman mapping.112 Compared to the
original GO, the Raman intensity of the Au/GO hybrids was remarkably
enhanced 4-fold as a consequence of the surface enhancement effect
of the AuNPs. Similar results were demonstrated by other researchers.118 Moreover, SERS shows ultrasensitivity and quantitative
abilities in monitoring drug release behaviors due to its advantage
of narrow spectral bands, which overcome the drawbacks of the fluorescence-traceable
nanocarriers for tracking intracellular drug release dynamics.119

2.1.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) and Therapy
MRI contrast agents can reduce the T1 and/or T2 relaxation
times of protons
to enhance the magnetic resonance signal.120 However, the conventionally used Gd3+-based T1 contrast agents have some limitations, such as short
half-life, low sensitivity, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and renal
failure.121,122 In this regard, Gd-based nanostructures
have been extensively studied to increase T1 relaxivities and reduce safety concerns. Two-dimensional
graphene serving as a carrier has attracted a great deal of attention
owing to its unique physicochemical properties. Zhang et al.
developed a theranostic agent based on GO-Gd complexes.123 In this case, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA) was covalently conjugated with GO, followed by Gd3+ complexation, resulting in formation of GO-DTPA-Gd. Next,
DOX and either an anti-cancer drug or a fluorescent dye was loaded
on the surface of GO via π–π interactions for integrating
imaging and intelligent pH-sensitive drug delivery. The agent exhibited
much better contrast enhancement than the traditional Magnevist brand
MRI contrast agent. Moreover, after being uptaken by cancer cells,
the DOX on GO-DTPA-Gd complexes was successfully released to achieve
accurate chemotherapy.

In recent years, magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs), such as Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, have been proven to possess unique magnetic properties offering
sufficient sensitivity for T2-weighted
imaging.124 In addition, suitable aggregation
of MNPs has been reported to increase relaxivity rates (r2).125 However, uncontrolled
aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can cause precipitation
of the nanoparticles and thus reduce their time of circulation in
the blood due to reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance.126 Recently, magnetic Fe3O4/GO complexes were employed to realize a multifunctional theranostic
platform. For example, Wang et al. synthesized a multifunctional
nanocarrier system based on magnetic Fe3O4/GO
nanocomposites via inverse chemical co-precipitation.127 This system has difunctional characteristics,
with excellent MRI and intelligent pH-sensitive drug delivery.

In order to further optimize the theranostic platform, Wang et
al. developed a targeting peptide-modified mesoporous silica with
magnetic graphene.128 This type of composite
possesses many unique properties, such as large T2 relaxation rates (r2), facile
magnetic separation, high NIR photothermal heating, high DOX loading
capacity, and laser-mediated/pH-dependent synergistic release behavior,
which make it a robust platform for cancer theranostics.

2.1.4 Photoacoustic (PA) Imaging and Therapy
Photoacoustic
(PA) imaging, serving as a biophotonic diagnostic
modality, is mainly achieved by a safe thermal expansion mechanism.129,130 A PA signal is generated within the compounds when they are irradiated
by short-time laser pulses.130 Although
PA imaging overcomes the optical diffusion limit and gives access
to deeper tissue imaging by combining optical excitation with ultrasonic
detection, its sensitivity, determined by the compounds’ light
absorbance and heat capacity, is quite limited.131−133 Thus, it is necessary to improve the conversion efficiency of light
energy to thermal energy in order to achieve sensitive PA imaging.
Recently, various PA contrast agents with remarkable optical absorbance
properties, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and gold nanorods (AuNRs),
have been widely employed in efforts to enhance PA imaging sensitivity.134,135 It was demonstrated that the efficiency of heat transfer between
heterogeneous materials played a significant role in obtaining amplified
PA intensity.136 Numerous studies have
highlighted graphene-based heterogeneous systems as promising imaging
agents for achieving high-resolution PA imaging. For example, Moon
and co-workers produced rGO-coated AuNRs with superior amplified PA
performance.137 In this case, positively
charged AuNRs were dropped onto the negatively charged rGO (Figure 6). The improved PA
signal amplitude effect can reduce the damage to normal tissues from
laser or imaging agents.

rGO-AuNRs. (B) Representative
PA images obtained using excitation wavelengths of 700 and 800 nm

mice. Overlaid ultrasound (gray) and photoacoustic (red) images. Reprinted

In another study, a new nanocomposite
of indocyanine green-loaded
polydopamine-rGO (ICG-PDA-rGO) was developed in order to simultaneously
obtain an amplified PA signal and imaging-guided therapy effects.138 The ICG-PDA-rGO showed not only prominent PA
imaging sensitivity but also sufficient photothermal ablation effect
for tumor. Overall, these studies provide remarkable evidence for
the benefits of combining PA contrast agents with GO sheets to enhance
PA intensity.

2.1.5 Radionuclide Imaging
and Therapy
Radionuclide imaging (positron emission tomography
(PET) and single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT)), an imaging modality to measure
biochemical metabolism, requires radiolabeled imaging agents (e.g., 64Cu, 66Ga, and 125I).139−141 Numerous molecules, such as antibodies,142 nucleic acids,143 small-molecule ligands,144 and especially peptides,145−147 have been labeled with radionuclides as PET probes.148 Although decent tumor uptake was shown, fast
clearance of the radiolabeled molecules from the tumors and short
half-lives of the radionuclides limited their application in longitudinal
tumor detection and radiation therapy (RT).149,150

Recently, some studies have been focused on the incorporation
of radiolabeled molecules with GO for integration of imaging and therapeutic
components. For example, Shi et al. designed 64Cu-labeled
and antibody-conjugated rGO for tumor vasculature-targeted PET imaging
and PTT.151 The resulting 64Cu-NOTA-rGO-TRC105 exhibited long-term high aggregation in tumor
and favorable PTT effect. In addition, Yang et al. similarly synthesized
functionalized rGO with 64Cu and antibody for PET early
metastasis detection, targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics and PTT.152 Moreover, Chen et al. developed 131I-labeled rGO-PEG for SPECT imaging-guided RT and PTT for cancer.153

2.1.6 Multimodal Imaging and
Therapy
Multimodal imaging has attracted increasing interest
to overcome
the limitations of single-modal imaging.154−156 To achieve various modalities’ integration, incorporation
of independent modal contrast agents into a flexible platform has
gradually become a main strategy.157,158 However,
this way usually requires complicated synthetic procedures and harsh
conditions. Graphene is a competent platform due to its unique merits,
such as large surface area, remarkable π–π interactions,
and electronic properties.159,160 Xu et al. developed
an integrated imaging system (64Cu-rGO-IONP-PEG) combining
MRI with PET and PA imaging to obtain higher quality imaging and more
precise diagnostic data.161 PET with high
sensitivity and quantitative analysis, MRI featuring with high spatial
resolution, and PA imaging giving access to deep tissue detection
are excellent complements for disease diagnosis. In a follow-up report,
photosensitizer was loaded onto nanographene via π–π
stacking for multimodal-imaging-guided synergistic therapy. The resulting
GO-PEG-[64Cu]HPPH achieved not only PET, PA, and fluorescence
imaging simultaneously but also trimodal-guided tumor PDT.162 In addition, Jin et al. developed poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) microcapsules encapsulating GO and AuNPs for tumor PTT
guided by ultrasound (US)/computed tomography (CT) bimodal imaging.163 The PLA microcapsule can enhance US imaging.
AuNPs with X-ray attenuation properties enable the use of CT contrast
agents or radiosensitizers.164−166 Meanwhile, AuNPs can enhance
the effect of GO serving as a NIR-light absorbing agent, which efficiently
converts absorbed light into heat. These studies give powerful evidence
that graphene can serve as a multimodal imaging platform for tumor
theranostic applications and can, to some extent, overcome the limitations
of other platforms.

2.2 Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes
(SWNTs)
2.2.1 Fluorescence Imaging and Therapy
The inherent chirality-characteristic PL of semiconducting SWNTs
is characterized by NIR-I region excitation, large Stokes shift, ultralow
autofluorescence background, and deep tissue penetration.167−170 PL of SWNTs occurs when electron–hole (e-h) pairs recombine to emit a photon.171,172 Some studies have been reported about PL of SWNTs in micelle solutions,
air, and polymers.173 However, the relatively
low quantum yield (QY) of SWNTs (typically 0.1%–1.5%) severely
restricted its further bioapplications.174,175 It is well documented that the localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) of noble metals (e.g., gold or silver) enables surface-enhanced
fluorescence (SEF).176,177 The space between the carrier
and the precious metal surface has a close relationship with SEF that
is proportional to QY.178−180 One of the key approaches to
enhance the fluorescence as well as depress the quenching effect is
to find a good linker that can closely connect noble metals to the
surface of the SWNTs yet protect the SWNTs from direct conjugation.
For this, Yang and co-workers attached DNA to the surface of SWNTs
via π–π stacking interactions and then assembled
AuNPs onto the DNA-SWNTs, resulting in formation of AuNP-DNA-SWNT
hybrids (Figure 7).29 The DNA, serving as a spacer, separated AuNPs
from SWNTs to achieve excellent SEF from the SWNTs. Compared with
the SWNTs, the PL of AuNP-DNA-SWNTs was greatly more enhanced. In
addition to the above method of locating noble metals on the SWNTs
surface, PEGylated phospholipids were also used to enhance intrinsic
PL and strengthen optical absorbance in the NIR.181 The modified SWNTs were characterized by not only superior
PL imaging but also a greater PTT effect compared to AuNRs. In a similar
study, SWNTs were sonicated with sodium cholate, followed by surfactant
DSPE-mPEG5k exchange, to form phospholipid–polyethylene
glycol (PEG)-coated SWNTs (referred to as exchange-SWNTs) for NIR
imaging.182 The NIR PL of exchange-SWNTs
is better than that of direct SWNT/DSPE-mPEG5k conjugates.
Overall, despite the relatively low quantum yield (QY) of SWNTs, the
functionalized SWNTs with inorganic materials (e.g., noble metal Au
and Ag) or organic material (e.g., PEG and DNA) can show greatly enhanced
PL and have superior prospects in NIR PL bioimaging.

2.2.2 Raman Imaging and Therapy
SWNTs
with typical Raman spectra can give access to Raman imaging.183 The characteristic structure of SWNTs can produce
sharp van Hove singularities under the electronic density of states
(eDOS), which results in the occurrence of resonant Raman scattering.184 Compared with graphene, SWNTs themselves can
produce stronger characteristic resonance-enhanced Raman peaks with
tangential G bands (∼1580 cm–1) away from
the excitation wavelength, which contributes to sensitive detection
of unmodified SWNTs by Raman microspectroscopy.113,185 Heller et al. first reported the intrinsic Raman properties of SWNTs
for live cell imaging.186 In their work,
DNA-modified SWNTs (DNA-SWNTs) were used as cell markers that retained
persistent Raman scattering in live cells, which allowed them to be
used for long-term tracking in biological samples over months. Liu
et al. investigated the biodistribution of functionalized SWNTs by
invasive Raman spectroscopy of excised tissues to confirm the targeting
effect.187 Zavaleta et al. analyzed the
targeting effect of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide-modified
SWNTs by non-invasive Raman imaging in vivo.28 Although SWNTs exhibit the appropriate inherent Raman signals, too
much time is required to get a satisfactory Raman image.183 It was hoped that SERS might overcome this
obstacle. As such, Wang et al. developed a folic acid (FA)-conjugated
SWNT-Au nanocomposite (SWNT-Au-PEG-FA) for PTT and SERS imaging whose
imaging time was remarkably shortened compared to that of targeted
SWNTs (Figure 8).188

2.2.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Therapy
In addition to graphene, SWNT-based nanomaterials were also used
as scaffolds to anchor MNPs or Gd3+-based agents in order
to improve the imaging quality. MNPs/Gd3+ clustering on
SWNTs sheets would not only enhance MRI contrast but also improve
the physiological stability of the aggregated MNPs/Gd3+.189,190 To this end, Sitharaman et al. developed
ultra-short SWNTs (US-tubes) with nanoscale loading and confinement
of Gd3+n clusters to enhance
longitudinal relaxivity, r1.191 The MRI efficacies of these Gd3+n@US-tubes were 40–90 times larger
than those of clinical used Gd3+-based contrast agents.
Safety development of Gd3+n@US-tube as contrast agents
was later demonstrated by Holt et al.192 Further advancing upon these hybrid platforms, Gd3+-SWNTs
were confined inside the nanoporous structure of silicon particles
(SiMPs) by Ananta et al. to improve nanoscale confinement for enhancement
of the image contrast.193 The r1 relaxivity of the resulting SiMPs/Gd-SWNTs composites
increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to that of Gd-SWNTs
(Figure 9). The enhancement
in contrast can be attributed to the geometrical confinement of the
agents, which largely increased their tumbling time (τR). Therefore, nanoscale confinement could serve as a new and general
strategy to enhance the contrast of MNPs or Gd3+-based
contrast agents.

Recently, to integrate imaging
and therapy function, Hou et al.
developed a targeted multifunctional theranostic system based on Gd3+-SWNTs. Herein, hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified SWNTs (SWNTs-HA)
were first synthesized, and then DOX was conjugated with HA by disulfide
bonds (SWNTs-HA-ss-DOX). Finally, Gd3+ ions were loaded
on the sidewall defects of SWNTs.37 When
Gd/SWNTs-HA-ss-DOX were uptaken into cancer cells, high concentrations
of glutathione (GSH) broke the disulfide bond, which resulted in DOX
release to achieve precise chemotherapy.

In addition to the
above studies, mainly referring to T1-weighted
images, T2 negative
contrast agents based on MNPs-SWNTs have also been widely studied.36 Recently, Al Faraj et al. employed an iron-tagging
method to successfully develop iron-tagged and antibody-conjugated
SWNTs for enhanced magnetic targeting and non-invasive MRI monitoring.194 Therefore, perhaps Gd-based T1 or MNPs-based T2 contrast
agents conjugated with SWNTs could reach great imaging effects even
for better imaging and treatment.

2.2.4 Radionuclide
Imaging and Therapy
Similar to graphene, radiolabeled SWNTs
conjugates also have been
explored. Liu et al. reported 64Cu-radiolabeled SWNTs functionalized
with phospholipid-PEG (PL-PEG5400) and RGD peptide (Figure 10).187 PEGylation imparted to SWNTs high hydrophilicity
and resistance to protein non-specific binding, which resulted in
reduced RES uptake, long blood circulation, and stable PET imaging
of 64Cu-labeled SWNT-PEG-RGD. In addition, Cisneros and
co-workers successfully loaded 64Cu2+ ions into
SWNTs platform by sonication without the use of chelating ligands.195 The new strategy achieved stable loading of
contrast agents. The resulting 64Cu@GNTs give access to
excellent imaging quality.

2.2.5 Multimodal
Imaging and Therapy
To sum up, semiconducting SWNTs, characterized
by remarkable resonance-enhanced
Raman scattering, alluring PL, and strong optical absorption in the
NIR region, could be competent multimodal imaging platforms. Given
this, Wang et al. designed targeted SWNTs with attached Fe/Co nanoparticles
to label human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).196 The multimodal imaging platform gives access to triple-modal
imaging, including strong Raman signals, T2-weighted MR
images, and intense PA signals. These functionalized SWNTs were characterized
by high chemical stabilities and photostabilities. This study highlighted
the potential of well-functionalized SWNTs as multimodal imaging probes.
For further therapy under multimodal imaging guidance, Zhao et al.
prepared Mn2+-chelated and 31I-radiolabeled
SWNTs as a theranostic platform for tumor multimodal imaging and therapy.197 Their previous work confirmed that PDA with
phenol groups could be efficiently labeled with radioactive iodine
(e.g., 131I) using the chloramine-T oxidation method. PDA-modified
SWNTs were labeled with 131I using the same method used
for tumor gamma imaging. Depending on the inherent strong NIR absorbance
of SWNTs, 131I-based radioactivity and T1/T2 MRI of Mn2+, the functionalized SWNTs achieved magnetic resonance and gamma
bimodal imaging-guided PTT and radioisotope therapy under NIR.

2.3 Imaging and Therapy-Based Mesoporous Carbon
Three-dimensional MCNs with high drug loading and controlled drug
release capability are highly desirable to establish an intelligent
stimuli-responsive cancer theranostic system which can reduce adverse
effects of cytotoxic drugs and achieve treatment monitoring.198 Recently, MCNs combining both imaging contrast
agents and drugs simultaneously have received much attention. Zhou
et al. reported DOX-loaded colloidal mesoporous carbon nanospheres
(Meso-CNs) for tumor PTT and PA imaging.199 By side-by-side comparisons with SWNTs, graphene, and AuNRs, the
Meso-CNs were shown to possess higher absorption coefficients than
those of CNTs and graphene, and even comparable with those of AuNRs.
Moreover, Zhang et al. synthesized DOX-loaded hollow mesoporous silicon/carbon
(Si/C) NPs (PEG-Si/C-DOX) for highly effective PA imaging-guided chemo-thermal
tumor therapy.200 Zhang et al. constructed
a highly efficient multiple-stimuli-responsive nanosystems based on
hollow MCNs (HMCNs) for pH-responsive MRI and on-demand drug release
(Figure 11).39 Manganese oxide (MnOx) NPs can be in
situ generated and incorporated into the framework or onto
the surface of HMCNs to form MnOx-HMCNs by a redox reaction between
KMnO4 and a carbonaceous framework of HMCNs. The “OFF”
state that kept Mn atoms restricted within the MnOx NPs can been broken
up by the acidic microenvironment in tumor cells to release Mn2+ ions, which result in significantly enhanced T1 performance (“ON” state). Importantly,
DOX loaded onto MnOx-HMCNs through π–π stacking
was also highly sensitive to pH variations. In addition, introduction
of high-intensity focused ultrasound could significantly accelerate
the release rate of DOX from MnOx-HMCNs.

Furthermore, a GQDs-based
fluorescent mesoporous carbon nanoshell
(FMP-CNS) was developed as a hydrophobic drug carrier that integrated
functions of stimuli-responsive drug release, multimodal optical imaging,
and photothermal therapy/chemotherapy.48 The FMP-CNS can serve as an optical marker for confocal, two-photon,
and NIR fluorescence imaging. Moreover, the hydrophobic drug paclitaxel
(PTX), loaded on the FMP-CNS, can be controllably released under NIR
irradiation. MCNs can also carry fluorescent dyes. In a recent study,
a fluorescent probe based on oxidized MCNs (OMCNs)was constructed,
wherein Cy3-labeled ssDNA (P0 aptamer) was loaded on the
surface of OMCNs by π–π stacking, resulting in
almost complete fluorescence quenching (Figure 12).49 The P0 aptamer can specifically bind to the cell-surface mucin1
(MUC1) marker which is overexpressed in many malignant tumors (e.g.,
breast cancer and prostate cancer). Once exposed to MUC1, P0 aptamer, separated from OMCN, decomposed to achieve fluorescence
recovery.

2.4 Imaging and Therapy-Based Carbon Dots
At
present, CDs are receiving considerable attention for potential
theranostic applications owing to their unique superior properties,
such as inherent favorable aqueous solubility, good photostability,
easy modification, low toxicity, and excellent biocompatibility.201−206 For example, Cao et al. demonstrated the potential of CDs for cell
imaging with two-photon excitation in the NIR.59 Later, Yang et al. reported the first use of CDs for optical
imaging in vivo.207 Recently, a new type
of fluorescent carbon dots (CD-Asp), with the ability to specifically
target glioma, were successfully synthesized via a simple thermolysis
route using d-glucose and l-aspartic acid as starting
materials.208 CD-Asp could act as a targeting
fluorescence imaging agent for non-invasive glioma diagnosis, and
has the potential for use in constructing an intelligent nanomedicine
integrating diagnostic, targeting, and therapeutic functions. In addition,
there have also been some studies about the use of functionalized
CDs for multimodal imaging. Zhang et al. employed a hydrothermal carbonization
(HTC) approach for facile preparation of iodine-doped carbon dots
(I-doped CDs).209 The resulting CD composites
exhibited not only favorable PL but also high X-ray attenuation. In
another study, targeted magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Fe3O4@mSiO2) with fluorescent CDs were
constructed for fluorescence imaging and MRI (Figure 13).210

contrast and confocal laser scanning microscopy images of HeLa cells

Chemical Society.

However, the complex
synthetic route and high cost of CDs greatly
limit their practical applications. To address this issue, a highly
promising approach for the synthesis of carbon materials is based
on the use of well-defined molecular precursors.211 Ge et al. prepared novel CDs using polythiophene
phenylpropionic acid (PPA) as the precursor for fluorescence/PA
imaging-guided cancer PTT.212 Li et al.
successfully synthesized tetraphenylporphyrin-based carbon dots
(TPP CDs) for PDT of hepatoma.213 The TPP
CDs can efficiently generate 1O2, resulting
in significant cancer PDT efficacy. Jia et al. employed Hypocrella
bambusae (HB) as a raw carbon source to successfully synthesize H. bambusae CDs (HBCDs) which could be served as theranostic
agents for bimodal fluorescence/PA imaging-guided cancer synergistic
PDT/PTT (Figure14).214 The obtained HBCDs showed good water solubility, broad absorption,
red-light emission, and excellent biocompatibility. Similarly, another
type of CDs with intrinsic theranostic properties were prepared by
using polythiophenebenzoic acid (PBA) as carbon source for imaging-guided
PDT/PTT.215 The novel CDs from PBA exhibited
properties similar to those of the above HBCDs. Jia et al. designed
multifunctionalized CDs on the surface of SiO2-coated AuNRs
(AuNR@SiO2-CDs) as phototheranostics for cancer PDT/PTT
synergistic therapy under the guidance of FL and PA imaging.54

2.5 Imaging
and Therapy-Based Other Carbon Nanomaterials
Nanodiamonds
(NDs) can emit significant fluorescence and present
perfect photostability with no photobleaching, making them useful
for bioimaging without further functionalization.72,216 Massive research efforts have been devoted to the utilization of
NDs as fluorescent markers for cellular tracking in vivo/in vitro.69,72,217 In addition, NDs are characterized
by facet-specific electrostatic properties which contribute to coordination
of water molecules on specific facets. Thus, NDs themselves, to an
extent, improve the effect of MRI contrast agents. In one study, Hou
et al. conjugated Gd to a NDs surface to acquire T1/T2 dual-mode MR imaging.218 Furthermore, Waddington et al. demonstrated
that the nuclear Overhauser effect, a proton–electron polarization
transfer technique, enables high-contrast MRI of unfunctionalized
NDs in water.219 The technique significantly
expanded the theranostic capabilities of NDs and opened the possibility
that NDs themselves can serve as MR contrast agents. Recent in vivo
studies reported the clinical potential of utilizing NDs to deliver
chemotherapeutic agents.

Due to their surface-dependent PL,
excellent photostability, and biocompatibility, fullerenes can be
used for fluorescence imaging.220 For example,
hyaluronated C60 fullerene with a strong intrinsic
NIR fluorescence emission was designed for both fluorescence imaging
and PDT of HCT-116 tumors (CD44+).221 In
addition, Tan and co-workers presented a photoluminescent fullerene-capped
MSN system for bioimaging and pH-responsive drug delivery.222 Recently, metallofullerenes containing Gd complexes
(e.g., Gd@C60, Gd@C82, and Gd3N@C80) have been employed as MR contrast agents with much higher
relaxivity and safety than most commercial Gd-chelator agents.223−225 Gd-ion-associated toxicity
is decreased by confining Gd ions inside a robust carbon cage to suppress
their leakage. Therefore, the development of Gd-containing metallofullerene
contrast agents is highly desirable for multimodal imaging. Han et
al. synthesized a high-relaxivity-targeted Gd3N@C80 contrast agent (ZD2-Gd3N@C80) by conjugating
a small targeting peptide, ZD2 (Cys-Thr-Val-Arg-Thr-Ser-Ala-Asp),
for sensitive molecular MRI of breast cancer (Figure 15).226 Wang et
al. developed radionuclide 64Cu-labeled DOX-loaded PDA-gadolinium-metallofullerene
(Gd3N@C80, denoted as CDPGM) core–satellite
nanotheranostics for multimodal imaging-guided combination cancer
therapy.227 Besides T1 MRI contrast agents, iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and upconversion nanophosphors were also loaded onto
C60 to achieve effective therapy and live surveillance
of tumors.228 Later, FA-modified C60-IONP-PEG was designed to achieve targeted PDT, release and
thermal therapy (RTT), and T2 MRI.101 Moreover, FA-modified C60@Au hybrid
aggregates were synthesized for radiofrequency-based controlled RTT,
PDT synergetic therapy, and X-ray imaging.229

3 Challenges
and Future Prospective
CBNs, as new stars in nanoresearch,
have attracted increasing attention
in the past few years in a wide array of fields, especially for biological
applications such as bioimaging, drug delivery, and cancer therapeutics.
In this article, we look at various applications of MCBNs in tumor
molecular bioimaging and imaging-guided molecular-level cancer therapy.
As a primary conclusion based on the considerable research over the
past two decades, it can be said that MCBNs have tremendous potential
in early comprehensive diagnosis and precise treatment of cancer due
to their intrinsic physicochemical properties.

Although molecular
imaging has demonstrated promising potential
for MCBNs and will play a significant role pertaining to increased
theranostic accuracy as well as improved prognosis of disease, the
most realistic direction for highly sensitive and non-invasive theranostic
technology is its application to patient care. This means that there
are considerable challenges to be addressed before MCBNs can be translated
into actual use in clinical practice. Although various functionalization
strategies have been developed to reduce toxicity and improve biocompatibility,
efforts are still needed to further implement more systematic toxicology
studies to determine the interactions between MCBNs and physiological
systems and the pharmacokinetics of MCBNs according to U.S.
FDA guidelines.

In order to reduce undesirable side effects
on the human body,
“precision medicine”, which involves accurate localization
and precise removal of tumors under imaging guidance, has become the
current cutting-edge topic. Some researches have made use of tumor’s
microenvironment to active targeting, based on, e.g., low pH, high
H2O2, and abundant GSH. On the other hand, by
controlling the size of the nanomaterials in order to avoid liver
and spleen phagocytosis, some researches have optimized the permeability
and retention effects of MCBNs to notably improve passive targeting.
Although these are exciting strategies, a significant concern that
remains is how to precisely target tumor sites to achieve accurate
diagnoses and therapy.

For cancer theranostics, image-guided
synergistic therapy and intelligent
drug delivery systems are the most promising trends. In order to acquire
more comprehensive disease information, which is essential for diagnosis
and treatment, multimodal imaging is practically feasible for overcoming
the inherent limitations of each modality alone. MCBNs can serve as
a multiplatform, gathering different imaging agents and therapeutic
drugs for cancer diagnosis and therapy integration. Despite the certain
challenges and unresolved obstacles, MCBNs have potential clinical
advantages as imaging and treatment agents and will be more likely
to be applied in clinical settings in the near future. Finally, significant
investigation will be required to further develop advanced carbonaceous
nanomaterials for improving the efficacy of theranostics and reduce
side effects. Once MCBNs are established in that field, their applications
in theranostics would become more realistic.
