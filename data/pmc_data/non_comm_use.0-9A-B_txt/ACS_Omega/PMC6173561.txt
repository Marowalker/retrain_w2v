Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based
metabolomic approach is
a high-throughput fingerprinting technique that allows a rapid snapshot
of metabolites without any prior knowledge of the organism. To demonstrate
the applicability of NMR-based metabolomics in the field of microalgal-based
bioremediation, novel freshwater microalga Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 that showed hypertolerance to As(III, V) was chosen
for evaluating the metabolic perturbations during arsenic stress in
both its oxidation states As(III) and As(V). Using NMR spectroscopy,
we were able to identify and quantify an array of ∼45 metabolites,
including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phosphagens, osmolytes,
nucleotides, etc. The NMR metabolomic experiments were complemented
with various biophysical techniques to establish that the microalga
tolerated the arsenic stress using a complex interplay of metabolites.
The two different arsenic states distinctly influenced the microalgal
cellular mechanisms due to their altered physicochemical properties.
Eighteen differentially identified metabolites related to bioremediation
of arsenic were then correlated to the major metabolic pathways to
delineate the variable stress responses of microalga in the presence
of As(III, V).

1 Introduction
Metabolomics
is the end point of omics cascade that represents
an array of metabolites, including amino acids, carbohydrates, organic
acids, nucleotides, etc.1 Metabolic profiling
can be performed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
and/or with setup of gas/liquid chromatography/capillary electrophoresis
(GC/LC/CE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) (examples: GC–MS,
LC–MS, CE–MS, etc.).2,3 The key parameters
required for developing a robust metabolomics platform include reproducibility,
easy and rapid quantification, and identification of large number
of metabolites with minimal sample preparation steps.4 NMR spectroscopy metabolomic approach is a nondestructive
and nondiscriminating technique, thus making it an ideal tool for
metabolomic profiling for any chosen organism.1,5 Given
the above advantages of 1H NMR metabolomics, it has been
widely applied to diverse fields, including understanding of drug
metabolism, disease progression, biomarker discovery, nutritional
research, effects of xenobiotics on plants, photochemistry, food adulterations,
etc.4,6−8

Among the above
mentioned applications, environmental metabolomics
is an effective tool for analyzing the changes in complex biochemical
mechanisms/pathways against the stress-generating agents, such as
toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and extreme pH/temperature conditions.3,9 Rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to escalation in
levels of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems, thus posing a greater
threat to plant, animal, and human life.10,11 Among the heavy metals, arsenic (As) has been reported to cause
high incidence of arsenicosis in more than 20 countries across the
globe, thereby listing it as a category 1 and class A carcinogen by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.11,12 High levels of arsenic in potable water sources have been reported
in various countries, including southwest Finland (17–980 mg/L),
western United States (1–48 000 mg/L), and Inner Mongolia,
China (1354 mg/L).13 Arsenic has a complex
physicochemistry as it exists in two interchangeable forms, anoxic
trivalent As(III) and oxic pentavalent As(V) in the aquatic ecosystems.14

The conventional techniques deployed for
the removal of arsenic
from contaminated water bodies are biased toward one form of arsenic
species, pH dependent, and require high maintenance and expensive
mineral adsorbents making the overall process costly and less efficient.15,16 In this regard, microalgae have emerged as budding vectors for green
mitigation of arsenic(III, V) from contaminated water sources owing
to their (a) inexpensive and copious availability and (b) high surface-to-volume
ratio providing large contact area for the metal binding, thus increasing
the binding, efficacy, as well as the removal.17 Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
both marine and freshwater microalgae as phycoremediators of arsenic.14,17−22 Recently, we reported that an oleaginous microalga Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 was able to efficiently tolerate half-a-gram (500 mg/L)
of both As(III, V) along with astonishing removal efficiency. The
microalga adapted to such high arsenic levels by altering their biochemical
composition, as evidenced by the observed changes in protein, carbohydrate,
lipid content, and photosynthetic pigments.22

In the current investigation, 1H NMR-based metabolomic
approach coupled with various biophysical techniques was used to unravel
the differential metabolic profiles and morphological features of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 in the presence of As(III) and
As(V). Our initial goal is to identify the metabolites associated
with arsenic stress and to categorize them according to biological
functions of microalga. Considering the difficulties in the metabolite
extraction of algal species due to their firm cell wall structure,
till date only 10–12 metabolites have been reported using NMR-based
approach upon heavy-metal stress (cadmium, copper, and lead) in microalgae.9,23,24 Using our improvised metabolite
extraction protocol for microalgae, we were able to extract and identify
a total of ∼45 metabolites. Furthermore, the current investigation
unveiled 18 differential metabolites that are characteristic to mitigation
and alteration of hosts signaling pathways upon uptake of As(III)
and As(V). It is worth noting that no such comprehensive NMR metabolic
profiling was available on As(III, V) or other heavy-metal bioremediation
by microalgae.

2 Results
Arsenic(III,
V) is a toxic heavy metalloid whose uptake by the
microalga induces stress, influencing most of its morphological, physicochemical,
and biochemical characteristics. To investigate the maximum arsenic
tolerance and bioremediation efficiency of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2, the microalga strain was cultivated at different concentrations
of As(III, V), ranging from 10 to 1000 mg/L (Figure S1). Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 was able to
tolerate up to 500 mg/L of both As(III) and As(V) with an half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of ∼779 and
622 mg/L (Figure S1A). The microalga showed
∼98% removal of both the arsenic forms at initial metal metal
concentration of 10 mg/L, which systematically reduced to ∼72%
once the initial metal concentration in the growth medium was increased
to 500 mg/L (Figure S1B). Further, to understand
the holistic effects of arsenic on the morphological features and
metabolome of microalga (Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2),
we deployed 1H NMR-based metabolomics coupled with various
biophysical methods.

2.1 Interaction between As(III,
V) and Microalgal
Cell Surface
Arsenic in aquatic ecosystems exists mainly
in two forms, anoxic trivalent As(III) and oxic pentavalent As(V).14 Both arsenic forms can further exist in different
anionic and cationic species depending on the pH.22 In the present study, the pH of the growth media ranged
between pH 7 and 8, causing As(V) to exist in HAsO4–2 and HsAsO4– whereas
As(III) majorly (>90%) exists in its neutral form H3AsO3.22 The green microalgae
cell wall
possesses distinct functional groups (O-, N-, S-, and P-) that help
in the binding of heavy metals on to their cell surface.25 Heavy metals are also known to bind with microalgal
cell wall via phytochelatins (PCHs), which aid in detoxification of
heavy metal.26 Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed to identify the functional groups
involved in the biosorption of arsenic onto the microalgal cell surface
(Figure 1). The FT-IR
spectra of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 loaded with As(III,
V) indicated shifting of various peaks with respect to control.

Figure 1 FT-IR profiles
of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 cultivated
in the absence and presence of 500 mg/L As(III) and As(V).

On spiking with As(III), the O–H and N–H
stretching
at 3307 cm–1 shifted to a higher wavenumber (3428
cm–1), indicating an alteration in the H bonding.
A decrease in the shift at 2930 cm–1 in control
to 2921 cm–1 indicated interaction of As(III) with aliphatic C–H and aldehyde
C–H stretching. Our study is in line with earlier reported
studies on binding of As(III) with Ulothrix cylindrium and Chlorella pyrenoidosa.12,27 The absorption peak at 1660 cm–1 in control algal
biomass shifted to 1641 cm–1 in As(III), corroborating
H binding as an interaction bonding. A shift in the peak from 1058
cm–1 in nonspiked biomass to 1039 cm–1 in arsenic-spiked biomass attributing to the C–N stretching
vibrations of amino groups indicates interaction between nitrogen
of amino group with arsenic (Figure 1). Indeed, significant similarities existed between
the spectra of algal biomass loaded with As(III) and As(V) in the
prominent peaks at 2921 and 1039 cm–1, respectively.
However, two notable differences existed between the FT-IR spectra
of As(V); an increase in the peak at 1256 cm–1 in
control to 1265 cm–1, indicating bonding of sulfide
linkages, and a decrease in the peak at 559 cm–1 in control to 531 cm–1 signifying involvement
of aromatic amino acids for the biosorption of As(V) (Figure 1). Such a differential characteristic
peak(s) shifting of amide and sulfide groups observed in As(III)-
and As(V)-spiked microalgal biomass with respect to control indicates
a distinct ion-exchange interaction between the algal surface with
As(III) and As(V).

2.2 Effect of Arsenic on Morphology
and Cell Surface
of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2
Interaction
of As(III, V) with the surface markers of the microalga and their
presence inside the algal cell can significantly influence its shape/size
and morphology. To elucidate the physical characteristics (cell size,
cell shape, surface texture, etc.) of As(III, V)-spiked algal cells,
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) studies were performed. FE-SEM micrographs of As(III)-
and As(V)-spiked Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 suggested
that the microalgal cells retained their ellipsoidal shape (Figure 2A–C). However,
the surface of the cells appeared more ruptured, rough with ridged
textures, as compared to control cells which were smooth (Figure 2A–C). The
resultant rigid texture of algal cell spiked with arsenic can be attributed
to the adsorption of arsenic onto the cell surface, which was confirmed
by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Figure 2D–F). The surface characteristics
of the algal cells visualized by three-dimensional AFM image suggested
that the microalgal cell surface of control was smooth without drops,
whereas on treatment with arsenic(III, V), the surface of the cell
became rough and irregular with frequent drops throughout (Figure 2G–I). Thus,
AFM analysis validated the aberrations caused by As(III) and As(V)
to the surface of microalgal cells.

X-ray (EDX) (D–F) analysis, and (G–I) atomic force microscopy

As(III): (B, E, H); and As(V): (C, F, I). The images were collected
at a concentration of 500 mg/L of As(III, V).

2.3 Metabolic Changes Observed in Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 upon Exposure of As(III) and As(V)
To gain
deep insights on the variable effects of As(III) and As(V) on Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2, the metabolites obtained from
aqueous methanolic extract of microalga were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy.
The cumulative 1H NMR spectra (n = 6 replicates)
of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 control polar extracts
stacked up with those of cultures spiked with As(III) and As(V) metal
systems were recorded (Figure 3A). A total of 45 metabolites were identified composed of
carbohydrates/sugar (5), amino acids (17), organic acids (7), phosphagen
(2), nucleotides (2), osmolytes (3), and others (9) (Table S1). Several of the assigned metabolites were validated
using the two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments, such as 1H–1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H–13C single-quantum correlation spectroscopy
(HSQC), and 2D J-resolved spectroscopy (JRES). Representative
plots for the metabolite assignments using these experiments were
presented in Figures S2–S4.

Figure 3 (A) Cumulative
one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra (n = 6) of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 control
polar extracts (blue) stacked up with those of cultures spiked with
As(III) (red) and As(V) (green) metal systems. The spectral peaks
were assigned for particular small-molecule metabolites. The water
region at δ 4.6–4.9 was removed for clarity. The abbreviations
used are: 3-OH-IV: 3-hydroxyisovalerate; Gln: glutamine; Glu: glutamate;
EA: ethanolamine; Cys: cysteine; Cho: choline; PC: phosphocholine;
GPC: glycerophosphocholine; DSS: 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid; TMAO: trimenthylamine-N-oxide; DMG: N,N-dimethylglycine; Phe: phenylalanine;
and ATP: adenosine triphosphate. (B) The combined principal component
analysis (PCA) 2D score plot resulted from the analysis of 1D 1H Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) spectra
of Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 exposed to different
metal treatments over a period of 10 days (green = control; blue =
As(III) spiking; red = As(V) spiking). The semitransparent red and
blue ovals represent the 95% confidence interval. (C) PCA loading
plot revealing the metabolites responsible for the discrimination
pattern; the more the metabolite is away from the origin (0, 0), the
more it contributes in the group discrimination.

The assignment of metabolites using NMR data showed clear
differences
in the peaks of carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, and mannose), amino
acids (leucine, alanine, valine, serine, and cysteine), ATP, organic
acids (fumarate, succinate, citrate, and acetate), and nucleotides
in control as compared to those in As(III) and As(V) algal extracts
and also between the two arsenic species (Figure 3A). To validate these variabilities across
the three treatments, multivariate analysis was performed using principal
component analysis (PCA). The PCA analysis showed statistically significant
clustering of the six biological replicates and distinct differences
between the control and arsenic-treated algal samples, as well as
between As(III) and As(V), assuring a differential metabolic profiling
in all three cases (Figure 3B). The PCA loading plot revealing metabolites responsible
for the discrimination pattern along with the assignment of few relevant
metabolites is shown in Figure 3C. Univariate analysis was further performed to identify the
relative change in the metabolite levels. Representative box-cum-whisker
plots derived from the univariate analysis shown in Figure 4, clearly revealed the quantitative
variations of relative signal integrals for algal metabolites in response
to As(III) and As(V) treatment. The quantitative data of significantly
altered algal metabolites were visualized using quantitative NMR analysis
and hierarchically clustered heat maps to discern the dissimilarity
between the three experimental groups (Figure 5). The results clearly established that the
As(V)-treated group was remarkably different in terms of the expression
levels of metabolites compared with control and As(III)-treated groups
(Figure 5 and Table S1). These metabolites, including amino
acids, organic acids, sugars, and osmolytes, are distinct between
As(III) and As(V) species. Among the identified metabolites, 28 metabolites
were overexpressed in both As(III, V) -spiked microalgal cells, whereas
only two metabolites (betaine and TMAO) showed reduced levels as compared
with control (Table S1). Apart from 28
mutually overexpressed metabolites of As(III, V), 12 metabolites were
exclusively enhanced in As(V)-treated microalgal cells (Table S1).

Figure 4 Box plots showing relative abundance of
some of the metabolites
showing significant variation after As(III) and As(V) spiking compared
with normal algal culture. In the box plots, the boxes denote interquartile
ranges, horizontal line inside the box denotes the median, and bottom
and top boundaries of boxes are 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.
Lower and upper whiskers are 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively.
The corresponding chemical shift (in ppm) for each of the metabolites
was also presented.

Figure 5 Heat maps showing z-scores of discriminatory metabolite
entities altered in either As(III) or As(V) spiking compared with
control algal culture. X axis represents the six
replicates of the culture (A) control: lane (1–6), red bar;
(B) As(III): lane (7–12), green bar; (C) As(V): lane (13–18),
blue bar. The color scheme through signifies the elevation and reduction
in metabolite concentration in As(III) or As(V) spiking compared with
normal algal culture: dark blue, lowest; dark red, highest.

Among the identified differential
metabolites, a total of 18 metabolites
was then correlated for their role in As(III, V) bioremediation by
the microalga. Out of these 18 metabolites, 13 were differentially
regulated for both As(III, V). A 2-fold increase in the levels of
free amino acids involved in bioremediation, such as glutamate, valine,
glycine, proline, and cysteine, was recorded in As(V)-treated microalgal
cells in comparison with As(III) treatment (Table 1). Analogous to the results of the free amino
acids, the levels of carbohydrates (sucrose, glycerol, and glucose)
and ATP were higher in As(V)-spiked cells as compared to those in
As(III). The levels of fumarate, choline/phosphocholine (PC), and
glycerophosphocholine (GPC) were also high in As(V) as compared to
that in As(III)-spiked microalgal cells. Thus, the above metabolic
responses established that As(V) was more toxic to the microalgal
cells as compared with As(III). Such an enhanced toxicity indeed resulted
in overexpression of five specific metabolites (sarcosine, succinate,
citrate, glutarate, and glutamine) exclusively under As(V) stress
conditions (Table 1). Differential regulation of these extra four metabolites suggests
that Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 has activated additional
defense mechanism to cope with the enhanced toxicity of As(V).

3 Discussion
3.1 Mechanistic Insights into Bioremediation of
As(III, V) by Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 Using NMR-Based
Metabolite Data
The current study is an attempt to deploy
a comprehensive NMR-based metabolomic approach to quantify an array
of metabolites responsible for efficient bioremediation of arsenic
by the hypertolerant microalga. The first step toward the bioremediation
of any metal by microalgae is binding and adsorption to the cell wall
(Figure 6). The elevated
levels of glycine, valine, and glutamine under arsenic stress signified
complexation of arsenic to the microalga biomass.28 Further, a distinct peak of choline/PC and GPC was observed
in the NMR spectra of arsenic-spiked microalgal cells. Phytochelatins
(PCHs) play all three essential roles in metal bioremediation; (a)
help in metal binding, (b) act as antioxidant, and (c) assist in signaling,
thereby protecting the algal cell from the deleterious effect of heavy
metal.26 The differential shifting of functional
groups in FT-IR spectra between As(III) and As(V) combined with distinct
levels of choline/PC observed through NMR evidenced the distinct binding
pathways of these two arsenic species by microalgae. Post internalization,
an increase in the levels of proline content in As(V)-spiked algal
cultures followed by that in As(III) as compared with control suggested
activation of arsenic detoxification process by the microalga (Figure 6). Proline has been
reported to have diverse roles during stress, such as it acts as a
metal chelator, osmoprotectant, inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, reactive
oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, and has antioxidant properties.29 Under oxidative stress, the microalgal cell
starts generating components such as ascorbate, glutathione, and pyridine
nucleotides (NAD+/NADP+) to combat this stress.26 The metabolomic profile also showed an increase
in the levels of cysteine and glutamate in arsenic-spiked cultures
as compared with control, with more elevation in the As(V) cultures.
Indeed, these metabolites also protect the cell by scavenging ROS,
thereby aiding the cell survival.30 In
a previous study, two different microalgae Chlorella sp. and Monoraphidium arcuatum were
evaluated for their arsenic toxicity mechanism.30 The authors reported that Macrostemum arcuatum was more sensitive to arsenic and actively excreted both As(III,
V) into the medium, whereas Chlorella sp. was more
tolerant and mitigated arsenic by binding to thiols, undergoing complexation
in intracellular vacuoles, followed by reduction to methylated forms.30 As Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2
and Chlorella belong to Chlorophyceae algal class, we presume a similar arsenic tolerance mechanism, which
was also evident by increase in PC, glutamate, glutamine, and cysteine
responsible for thiol oxidation.

Figure 6 Schematic showing the hierarchy of arsenic(III,
V)-induced metabolic
changes in the microalgal cells: (1) Arsenic intake via AQP/hexose
and phosphate channels, (2) metal complexation by PC, (3) ROS generation
in response to arsenic stress, (4) mitigating ROS stress by modulating
protein metabolism, glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid, and (5) endoplasmic reticulum stress resulting in increase in lipid content.

Parallel to changes in the amino acids and PC/GPC, an increase
in the soluble sugars was recorded in arsenic-spiked microalgal cells
(Figure 6). High levels
of sucrose and α/β-glucose were observed in As(V) cultures
compared to those in As(III), which help in maintaining osmotic balance
during the bioremediation by microalga. Moreover, an elevation in
the levels of glycerol (osmolytic polyol) also suggested maintenance
of carbon pool during stress conditions to protect the photosystem.31 Carbohydrates and polyols also act as osmoprotectants,
which helps to stabilize the cell membrane.32,33 Further an increase in the levels of fumarate in both As(III, V)-spiked
cultures indicated limitation of the deleterious effects of the heavy
metal.29 Interestingly, the levels of several
of the organic acids, such as succinate, citrate, and glutarate, were
unaltered upon As(III) spiking whereas they were enhanced substantially
upon As(V) spiking. Citrate acts as a detoxifying molecule by quenching
the metal ions, whereas glutarate is involved in PC synthesis. All
above results concisely deduce the hierarchy of arsenic tolerance/bioremediation
(Figure 6). To gain
detailed insights into the hierarchical activation of these multiple
pathways of metabolites and mitigation of arsenic, a future time course
metabolomic analysis integrated with proteomics and transcriptomics
studies is quintessential.

4 Concluding
Remarks
In a nutshell, we demonstrated the effectiveness
of using proton
NMR-based metabolomic approach in answering environmental toxicological
responses. The current study identified an array of metabolites, which
provided information on the arsenic mitigation mechanism by a hypertolerant
microalgae. In a recent study, 1H NMR, in conjunction with
high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), was deployed to identify
and quantitate metabolites in bacteria on exposure to metal nanoparticles.34 The authors initially utilized 1H
NMR to tentatively assign metabolites by matching with an open-access Escherichia coli metabolome database (ECMDB) and
structurally validated via HRMS. In the current study, we have developed
an exclusive NMR (1D and 2D) metabolomic workflow to efficaciously
assign algal metabolites that can serve as a starting framework for
algal metabolome database. Such a database can be enriched with more
metabolites using similarity search algorithms on plant, yeast, and
bacterial metabolite databases and metabolites assigned using NMR/MS
techniques. The workflow developed could be utilized as a centralized
source for robustly assigning algal metabolites, which can shed light
on the different biochemical pathways instrumental in exploiting algae
on biotechnological platforms for flux analysis, and also to study
the effect of environmental factors or any stress stimulus.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Microalgae Cultivation
and Experimental Design
Scenedesmus sp.
IITRIND2 (Genebank Accession number KT932960) was
isolated from a freshwater lake in India and maintained in modified
Bold’s Basal medium.35 Arsenic stock
solutions (10 g/L) were prepared by dissolving salts of NaAsO2 (As(III)) and Na2HAsO4.7H2O (As(V)) in sterilized distilled water. To perform the experiments,
the microalga were adapted and cultivated in synthetic soft water
(SSW).36 The microalga were cultivated
in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 75 mL of culture for 96 h
(log phase) in SSW at 27 °C, with a photoperiod of 16 h [8 h
light–dark cycle irradiated with six white fluorescent lights
(300 μmol/(m2 s))]. The cells were then centrifuged
at 6000g for 10 min, and the cell pellet (1 ×
105 cells/mL) obtained was washed thrice with autoclaved
distilled water and then resuspended for inoculation in SSW, SSW with
500 mg/L of As(III), and SSW with 500 mg/L of As(V), respectively.
The number of cells were counted using a haemocytometer cell counter
by staining cells with trypan blue. Briefly, 100 μL of microalgal
cells were mixed with 100 μL of trypan blue (0.4% in phosphate-buffered
saline; pH 7.2) and incubated for 5 min. The cell suspension (10 μL)
was then used to count the cells using a compound microscope. The
cell density was then calculated according to the formula  The toxicity
of As(III) and As(V) to the microalga
was determined using a 96 h growth inhibition bioassay.37 Inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (PerkinElmer,
ELAN DRC-e) was used to estimate the amount of arsenic(III, V) left
in the SSW after 10 days of algal growth. The concentration of arsenic
was calculated by plotting a standard curve from different concentrations
(0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/L) of As(III) and As(V) using
a mixture of Rh, Ge, and Ir (100 mg/L) as internal standard. The metal
uptake capacity was evaluated using the following equation  

5.2 Characterization of Arsenic
Interaction and
Morphological Changes in Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2
The adsorption of As(III, V) on to the microalga was analyzed by
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet NEXUS,
Maryland) at 400–4000 cm–1 wavenumber range,
with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) coupled
to energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (FE-SEM Quanta 200 FEG).22,38 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (NT-MDT-INTEGRA) was performed
to visualize the changes in the surface morphology of arsenic-spiked
microalgal cells. Briefly, the microalgal cells (2 × 106) were fixed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides using
2.5% glutaraldehyde (24 h in dark at 4 °C) followed by dehydration
(10–100% ethanol) and then visualized under the microscope.

5.3 NMR-Based Metabolomics and Multivariate Analysis
For the extraction of the metabolites, 40 mg of lyophilized microalgal
biomass (harvested on the 10th day) from the control, As(III), and
As(V) cultures was ground with liquid N2 using 1 mL of
20% methanol, as mixture of methanol/water allows a better separation
of polar components from the nonpolar components by lowering down
the surface tension and polarity of water and increasing the density.23 The process was repeated twice; the supernatant
was pooled together and lyophilized overnight. Lyophilized samples
were reconstituted in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), and the samples
were relyophilized to maintain a uniform pH across all samples to
have a spectral overlap of chemical shifts across the samples and
also to facilitate the NMR acquisition in deuterium oxide (D2O). The lyophilized samples were dissolved in 550 μL of D2O containing a chemical shift indicator (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid (DSS), 0.5 mM). All proton NMR spectra were acquired on an 800
MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Each NMR spectrum
consisted of 128 scans of 16 384 data points in the frequency
domain, and the spectra were collected using a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG) pulse sequence consisting of water presaturation (during relaxation
delay of 4.00 s).

The 1D spectra were Fourier transformed using
an exponential window with a line broadening value of 0.5 Hz, phased
and baseline-corrected using Chenomx NMR suite 8.1 (Chenomx Inc.,
AB, Canada) prior to chemical shift and intensity measurements. 1H NMR chemical shifts in all spectra [control and arsenic(III,
V)-spiked] were referenced with respect to the methyl peak of DSS
at 0.00 ppm. Chemical shifts in the 1D 1H NMR spectra were
identified and assigned using the 800 MHz chemical shift database
in Chenomx Profiler and were validated by comparing them with other
databases and the literature report.23,39

The
resonance assignments obtained for the microalga samples were
further validated using two-dimensional NMR experiments such as homonuclear 1H–1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H–13C single-quantum correlation spectroscopy
(HSQC), and 2D J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra, on
the basis of their specific patterns of HH/CH correlations and 1H–1H scalar coupling constants, respectively.
The complete details of experimental procedures for 2D NMR experiments
are provided in Appendix S1 (Supporting
Information). HSQC and TOCSY analysis was validated using MetaboMiner
with tolerances of 0.02 ppm (1H) and 0.5 ppm (13C).40

For multivariate data analysis,
the NMR spectra were integrated
and normalized against internal standard area of DSS and the data
were reduced into spectral bins (0.03 ppm width) using Pathomx.39 The resultant data was imported into Metaboanalyst
(v3.0) software for multivariate data analysis, performed using the
principal component analysis (PCA).41,42 Metabolites
that influenced the differentiation pattern were identified from the
loading plot; the greater the distance of a particular variable from
the origin (0, 0), the greater is its contribution in distinguishing
the groups. The relative metabolic changes were assessed using univariate
(or box-plot) analysis, and statistical significance was determined
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Metaboanalyst.43 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using Ward
linkage was further employed to create the heat map consisting of
40 metabolite entities (with p < 0.001) that had
the highest impact on separation of the different treatment groups.
The resulted heat map was used to assess how similar or different
the arsenic samples are compared with normal control samples on the
basis of their metabolite profiles.
