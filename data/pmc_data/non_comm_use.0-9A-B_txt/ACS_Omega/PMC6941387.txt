Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bilayer-enclosed
vesicles
of submicron size that are secreted by various cells. As mediators
of intercellular communication, EVs can alter the physiological state
of recipient cells by delivering encapsulated proteins and nucleic
acids. Incontestably, growing evidence has shown important biological
roles and the clinical relevance of EVs. The use of stem cell-derived
EVs as a cell-free therapeutic modality for skin treatment has emerged
as a promising application in dermatology. However, the moderate isolation
efficiency of prevalent ultracentrifugation and low secretion rate
make the massive low-cost production of EVs difficult. Here, we report
development of engineered EVs (eEV) derived from human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) for skin treatment. Ultrasonication
was used to shear intact hucMSCs for only 1 min, followed by regular
centrifugation and filtration for producing nanoscale eEVs. This approach
has ∼20-fold higher yield and ∼100-fold faster production
than that of naturally secreted EVs (nsEV), while the production cost
decreased to less than 10%. The eEVs have similar morphology, size
distribution, and typical protein markers compared to nsEVs. Moreover,
in vitro, both nsEVs and eEVs promote the proliferation and migration
of dermal fibroblasts and increase in the expression of collagen,
elastin, and fibronectin, whereas the matrix metalloproteinases-1
(MMP-1) and MMP-3 production can be significantly reduced. The wound-healing
study in mice showed that both nsEVs and eEVs promote wound recovery
in comparison with the controls. In sum, our results indicate that
hucMSC-derived eEVs prepared by ultrasonication potentially can be
used to increase skin extracellular matrix and enhance skin rejuvenation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Due to self-renewal property,
multilineage differentiation potential,
paracrine effects, and immunosuppressive properties, mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) are attractive and promising cells for regenerative medicine.1,2 MSCs can be harvested from different adult (adipose tissue, peripheral
blood, bone marrow) and neonatal tissues (particular parts of the
placenta and umbilical cord).3 Among the
source-dependent MSCs, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
(hucMSCs) are the youngest and most primitive MSCs that function in
various physiological activities.4 While
the isolation of MSCs from adult tissues requires an invasive procedure,
hucMSCs can be easily obtained from an extra-embryonic tissue after
birth and they are available in potentially large quantities. Moreover,
hucMSCs have a relatively rapid proliferation rate and harbor strong
immunomodulatory properties compared to their adult counterparts and
have intermediate properties between embryonic and adult stem cells.5,6 Recent studies demonstrated that the use of hucMSCs can promote
skin regeneration and rejuvenation, have antiaging/wrinkles effects,
inhibit skin pigmentation, and have other biological functions.7,8 In brief, hucMSCs have demonstrated advantages in skin and facial
treatments. However, the direct application of hucMSCs on the skin
has raised safety concerns related to unwanted inflammatory response,
potential tumorigenicity, vascular occlusion, etc.7,9 To
overcome the disadvantages, strategies related to the use of hucMSC
byproducts have been developed over the years. One such strategy involves
the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from hucMSCs.

EVs are lipid-bilayer-enclosed vesicles secreted by cells. Based
on their origin and size, EVs can further be classified as exosomes,
microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies.10 Currently,
exosomes (30–120 nm) and microvesicles (50–1000 nm)
are under intense investigation. These nanoscale EVs are secreted
from live cells. During their release procedure cytosolic proteins,
membrane proteins, and nucleic acids can be selectively wrapped.10 These EVs are capable of mediating intercellular
communication while transferring contents, and thus are known as signal
modulators.11,12 The suitable nanosize enables
them to cross physiological barriers and have relatively longer blood
circulation times, allowing efficient access to other tissues or organs.13 Also, direct implantation of derived EVs would
have minimum side effects compared to intact live allogenic hucMSCs.
These unique advantages make them a novel and promising cell-free
therapeutic modality for skin treatment. Nevertheless, the relatively
slow growth rate of hucMSCs, the low yield of EVs, and the moderate
isolation efficiency of prevalent ultracentrifugation (UC) make the
massive low-cost production of EVs very challenging. Hence, it is
difficult to translate hucMSC-derived EVs into practical applications.

In this study, we used ultrasonication to shear intact live hucMSC
to generate engineered EVs (eEV) in only 1 min, followed by regular
centrifugation and filtration. The eEVs were formed as a result of
the disruption of the cell membrane using shear or frictional forces,
release of biological molecules from inside a cell, and reorganization
of lipid bilayer-forming proteins/nucleic acid-encapsulated EVs in
seconds. Through investigation of the biological functions of eEVs
and comparison with naturally secreted EVs (nsEV), no significant
difference was found in their morphology and size. Both can promote
the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs),
aid in healing the wounds, and increase the expression of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins. Our results indicate that eEVs can potentially
be used for skin regeneration and rejuvenation and they can be efficiently
and rapidly prepared with ultrasonication.

2 Results
2.1 Optimization of Ultrasonication
Approximately,
1 × 106 hucMSCs were used to optimize the amplitude
and time of ultrasonication. To avoid potential break of the tapered
microtip, the maximum amplitude was set to 40%. After ultrasonication
at 20, 30, and 40% for 1 min, followed by centrifugation, filtration,
and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis, the average protein
concentrations in the respective groups were determined as 88.7 ±
2.6, 86.8 ± 10.6, and 91.9 ± 5.4 μg/mL. No significant
difference was found among the three groups [analysis of variance
(ANOVA), p > 0.05]. Meanwhile, the generated eEV
average amount was (9.4 × 109) ± (1.2 ×
108), (1.1 × 1010) ± (4.7 × 108), and (1.6 × 1010) ± (5.9 × 108) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). In each group, the
peak concentration at 133, 128, and 106 nm was observed. The higher
amplitude generated more eEVs with smaller average size. Given that
the total protein mass in the three groups was close, we speculated
that cytosolic and membrane proteins may not be efficiently encapsulated
into eEVs when 40% amplitude was used to generate eEVs. We further
speculated that these free proteins might not be protected from lipid
envelope from degradation by proteinase. Thereby, 20% amplitude was
selected for further trials. Next, 1, 3, and 5 min ultrasonication
at 20% amplitude was optimized with ∼1 × 106 hucMSCs. The average protein concentrations in the 3 and 5 min groups
were determined as 102.7 ± 16.8 and 226.6 ± 26.9 μg/mL
(ANOVA, p < 0.05), respectively, indicating that
cells can be significantly homogenized into nanosize that cannot be
pelleted with regular centrifugation. The generated eEV average amounts
in the 3 and 5 min groups were (1.7 × 1010) ±
(4.1 × 108) and (3.3 × 1010) ±
(6.5 × 108) (ANOVA, p < 0.05),
respectively. Moreover, in the 3 and 5 min groups, the peak concentration
at 124 and 94 nm was observed. Similarly, the extended treatment time
increased the eEV yield but decreased the average size. Through the
analysis of eEV amount, protein mass, and size, we determined that
1 min ultrasonication can efficiently package proteins into generated
eEVs. Altogether, 20% amplitude and 1 min ultrasonication were used
for eEV preparation.

2.2 EV Characterization
Under electron
microscopy, there was no significant difference in the morphology
between nsEVs and eEVs (Figure 1a). Both displayed a typical saucer-shaped morphology. After
filtration, the size of nsEVs and eEVs ranged from 50 to 500 nm, and
the average sizes of nsEVs and eEVs were 122.9 ± 2.3 and 133.3
± 1.8 nm, respectively (Figure 1b), indicating that eEVs are larger than nsEVs (t-test, p < 0.001). Based on the measured
concentration of nsEVs and eEVs, we determined that ∼1.5 ×
1011 nsEVs were collected from ∼3 × 108 hucMSCs after 48 h fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free culture
and 4 h UC processing. By contrast, ∼3.5 × 1011 eEVs were prepared with ∼3.3 × 107 hucMSCs
after 1 min ultrasonication and 30 min centrifugation. The productivity
was improved ∼18.5-fold, while the processing time decreased
∼104-fold. In addition, with ultrasonication, we only need
to culture ∼3.3 × 107 hucMSCs with six T-225
flasks. Based on the respective diameter and counts of eEV and hucMSC,
we calculated that the eEV generation efficiency was ∼30.2%,
indicating that a small proportion of cell membrane was utilized to
generate eEVs during ultrasonication. Of note, in our previous study,14 the eEV generation efficiency of ultrafiltration
was ∼20%. In comparison, six 10-layer T-225 cell factories
were needed to culture ∼3 × 108 hucMSCs. The
cell expansion from six flasks to six cell factories would also take
approximately 2 weeks. The overall cost for cell expansion and culture
was also decreased to less than 10%. Next, cargo proteins extracted
from ∼1 × 1011 nsEVs and eEVs were analyzed
by Western blot. Three EV membrane proteins, including CD9, CD63,
and CD81, were identified in both samples (Figure 1c), which further confirmed their identity
as EVs.

2.3 Proliferation and Migration of HDFs
The nsEVs or eEVs educated HDFs and counterpart were seeded into
a 96-well plate, respectively, to determine whether EVs can promote
the proliferation of HDFs. To better visualize and quantify the cell
expansion, 2% FBS was used to maintain HDFs. In the control group,
the average number of HDFs increased from 44.8 ± 3.2 at the 0
h timepoint, to 56.7 ± 2.9 at the 24 h timepoint, and further
to 100 ± 9.4 at the 48 h timepoint. In the nsEV group, the average
number of HDFs increased from 45.8 ± 3.6 to 117.2 ± 4.1,
and to 149.6 ± 6.8. In the eEV group, the numbers increased from
42 ± 3.6, to 137.2 ± 9.4, and to 174.7 ± 14.5 (Figure 2a). Both nsEVs and
eEVs educated HDFs showed a higher proliferation rate compared to
the control (t-test, p < 0.01).
Meanwhile, BrdU staining at the 48 h timepoint indicates 17.4 ±
1.3, 48.1 ± 5.6, and 52.3 ± 8.5% HDFs cells undergoing division
in the control, nsEV, and eEV groups (t-test, p < 0.01) (Figure 2b). Next, a wound-healing assay was performed to investigate
the migration of nsEVs or eEVs educated HDFs and counterpart. After
48 h culture, the wound width in the control group was 27.1 ±
10.6%. In contrast, the values in the nsEV and eEV groups were 5.3
± 3.1 and 2.7 ± 1.3%, respectively (t-test, p < 0.05) (Figure 2c). In addition, transwell migration assay was also performed.
After 48- h cell culture, the number of cells at the bottom of the
membrane in the control, nsEV, and eEV groups were 75.7 ± 3.1,
109 ± 7.3, and 128.3 ± 10.1, respectively (Figure 2d). The number of HDFs that
crossed the micropore increased ∼1.4- and ∼1.7-fold
by nsEVs and eEVs, respectively (t-test, p < 0.01). Together, the above findings indicate that
both nsEVs and eEVs can promote proliferation and migration in HDFs
in comparison with the control group, while it is inconclusive whether
eEVs are superior to nsEVs and vice versa.

2.4 Production of ECM Proteins
The ECM,
constituting over 70% of the skin, is the central hub for repair and
regeneration of the skin.15 Collagen and
elastin are key in the prevention of skin dehydration as well as in
firmness and elasticity preservation. Fibronectin is known to cause
cellular interactions with the ECM, and thus fibronectin plays an
important role in epidermal–dermal adherence in human skin,
proliferation, differentiation, and wound healing.16 Fragmentation of collagen, abnormal cross-linkages between
the collagen fragments, amorphous elastin agglutinations, and degradation
of the fibronectin can impede the ECM from its normal repair and regenerative
capacity.15 Hence, we investigated the
level of three key ECM proteins, including collagen, fibronectin,
and elastin, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits to
determine whether hucMSC-derived EVs can stimulate their expression.
The collagen expression level in nsEV or eEV educated HDFs was 4.3
± 0.33 and 4.7 ± 0.51 μg/mL, respectively, which was
significantly higher than 2.1 ± 0.4 μg/mL in the control
(Figure 2e) (t-test, p < 0.05). A significant increase
in the production of fibronectin and elastin was also observed in
nsEV or eEV educated HDFs. Compared to that of the control group,
the fibronectin concentration in the neEV and eEV groups increased
∼1.4- and ∼1.3-fold, respectively, and the elastin concentration
in neEV and eEV increased ∼2.5- and ∼2.2-fold, respectively.
Moreover, we also investigated the MMP mRNA level in nsEV and eEV
educated HDFs. MMPs are matrix-degrading enzymes that are activated
by UV exposure or inflammation. These MMPs contribute to the breakdown
of collagen while inhibiting new collagen formation, resulting in
damage of the HDFs.17 It has been found
that these aging fibroblasts can synthesize and secrete large amounts
of MMP-1 and MMP-3 to degrade skin collagen matrix.18 Moreover, MMPs are particularly important to skin photoaging
because of their collagenolytic activity. Seven of the 18 MMPs expressed
in human skin can significantly elevate the levels of MMP due to UV
radiation exposure, including MMP-1 and MMP-3.19,20 Therefore, we selected MMP-1 and MMP-3 to determine whether nsEV
or eEV can inhibit their expression. Routinely, UVB was used to induce
MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in the short term.21 UVB irradiation increased the mRNA expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3
by 8.3 ± 1.3- and 7.5 ± 0.7-fold, respectively, in the control
group. On the contrary, the expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 were
only increased 4.4 ± 0.8 and 2.9 ± 0.3 times in nsEV educated
HDFs, and 3.9 ± 0.4 and 2.8 ± 0.2 times in eEV educated
HDFs (Figure 2f). The
findings indicated that nsEVs decreased the MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression
by ∼47 and ∼61%, respectively (t-test, p < 0.05). Meanwhile, eEVs decreased the expression by
∼53 and ∼63%, respectively (t-test, p < 0.05). The ELISA test further confirmed that both
nsEVs and eEVs educated HDFs showed reduced expression of MMP-1 and
MMP-3. Of note, 54 and 69% reductions of MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein expression
in the nsEV group were observed, and 61 and 75% reductions of MMP-1
and MMP-3 protein expression in the eEV group (Figure 2g). It is possible that the reduction of
MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression peaked at an earlier timepoint compared
with the reduction in protein expression. Together, the observed decrease
in the mRNA level and protein downregulation confirms that using nsEVs
and eEVs in vitro can inhibit the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in
HDFs irradiated with UVB. Controlling MMP activity with hucMSC-derived
EVs could be one of the therapeutic strategies for treatment of photoaging.

2.5 Wound Healing in Mice
To investigate
the effect of nsEVs and eEVs on wound healing, full-thickness excisional
wounds of the same size were created on mice (Figure 3a). On day 9, wounds treated with nsEVs and
eEVs decreased to 26.7 ± 5.7 and 19.3 ± 3.4%, respectively.
In comparison, untreated wounds only decreased to 37.9 ± 13.8%,
indicating that nsEVs and eEVs can promote wound healing (t-test, p < 0.05). On day 14, wounds
treated with nsEVs and eEVs further decreased to 4.5 ± 2.7 and
4.1 ± 0.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the untreated wound remained
23.2 ± 8.9%, confirming that both nsEVs and eEVs can significant
promote wound healing (t-test, p < 0.005). Furthermore, the histologic structures of wounds from
the respective group were analyzed (Figure 3a). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
revealed that the nsEVs- and eEVs-treated wounds showed relatively
thick neo-epidermis and dermis than that of untreated wounds at day
14 post-wounding (Figure 3b). Masson’s staining showed larger amounts of fibroblast
in the wounds treated with nsEVs or eEVs compared with the controls.
The findings reconfirm that nsEVs and eEVs promote the wound-healing
process in mice (Figure 3c).

3 Discussion
Over the years, EVs have
emerged as novel therapeutics capable
of modulating a variety of cellular processes because selective packaging
and transport of contents enable changes in recipient cells. Recent
studies involving stem cell-derived EVs demonstrate that they are
promising for cell-free therapy in skin treatments. For example, stem
cell-derived EVs are capable of steering all three phases of wound
healing by initially modulating inflammation and further promoting
the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts.22 Moreover, the effects of natural aging can be reversed
by treatment with stem cell-derived EVs. Skin aging is caused by the
breakdown of connective tissue that is mediated by reduction in the
proliferation of dermal cells and low levels of ECM proteins,23 while EVs can promote the proliferation of dermal
cells and increase ECM protein levels responsible for stimulating
skin regeneration and rejuvenation.24 In
addition, photoaging effects caused by UV light damage to skin can
be reversed by stem cell-derived EVs suppressing the expression of
matrix-degrading proteins like MMPs and improving ECM protein production
in photoaging.25 In brief, use of stem
cell-derived EVs could serve as an excellent alternative therapeutic
strategy for skin treatments. Although stem cell-derived EVs are very
promising in skin regeneration and rejuvenation, the large-scale,
rapid, low-cost production of EVs is very challenging. To address
the low-yield issue, mechanical extrusion of stem cells for generating
nanoscale EVs has been developed.26,27 Generally,
in extrusion approaches, donor cells are harvested and resuspended
in solution, followed by pushing cells through microconstrictions,
such as micropores in a track-etched membrane, microchannels with
fixed width in a microfluidic device, etc.27 There are two major shortcomings of the physical extrusion that
need to be addressed. First, occlusion of the microconstrictions oftentimes
happens, resulting in the failure of extrusion. To avoid frequent
clogging, the concentration of cell suspension must be diluted to
a proper range. The filtration flow rate or pressure also needs to
be well controlled. Second, the throughput of cell processing is still
limited. For instance, normally, ∼106 cells need
to be continuously filtered with 10 and 5 μm track-etched membranes
at least three times to improve the yield of generated EVs, and the
whole procedure would take 30 min or longer. To extrude ∼107 cells with the track-etched membrane, multiple devices would
be required for processing in parallel. Similarly, a microfluidic
device inherently is designed for processing or analyzing microliter
or even nanoliter samples. It is not suitable for large-scale production
of EVs. In addition to extrusion, cryogenic grinding also has been
used to generate EVs.28 It can well preserve
the RNA and native protein at −80 °C or lower temperature.
But it requires dry ice or liquid nitrogen to maintain the low temperature,
and the sample loading/unloading is not convenient either. Moreover,
the plastic or metal microbeads for intense grinding also raise the
concern of plastic or metallic debris. Ultrasonication has been used
for cell homogenization, liposome/micelle preparation, drug loading
into vesicles, and other applications.29 The generated ultrasound waves cause periodical compression and
rarefaction when propagating through the medium. The microbubbles
formed during this process violently collapse within a few microseconds
after reaching a critical size, inducing the occurrence of cavitation.30 The sudden collapse initiates powerful hydromechanical
shear forces that can instantaneously shear and disassemble the cell
membrane. The cytosolic materials, including various RNA and proteins,
can be simultaneously released into the extracellular environment.
Meanwhile, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic membrane lipid can automatically
reassemble, forming vesicles, and during the reassembling, the surrounding
RNAs and proteins can be randomly encapsulated. In the optimization
step, higher amplitude and longer treatment time would better homogenize
cells and generate relatively smaller vesicles. But based on the protein
mass, EV amount, and size, we inferred that cargo loading was impaired
by intense amplitude and long timescale. Therefore, we chose a 20%
amplitude and a 1 min treatment with the 2 s on/off mode for producing
eEVs, and the generated eEVs show similar morphology, size distribution,
and typical EV protein markers compared to nsEVs. We directly resuspended
hucMSCs in 2 mL of PBS for ultrasonication, followed by centrifugation
and filtration, and the flow-through is ready to use. Of note, 20 000g centrifugation is a compulsory procedure. It removes big
cellular debris, which facilitates the following filtration with a
0.22 μm filter. The more important consideration is to clear
the generated apoptotic bodies and/or necrotic cell debris. In our
previous study, we noticed that without high-speed centrifugation,
the eEVs prepared by extrusion reversely can induce recipient cell
apoptosis and animal death (data not shown). We speculated that this
might be caused by the relatively large apoptotic bodies and/or necrotic
cell debris in the supernatant. Once high-speed centrifugation is
applied to remove debris and large microvesicles, the supernatant
can promote recipient cell growth again. Moreover, the >30 min
extrusion
procedure would leave cells sufficient time to develop these apoptotic
bodies and/or necrotic debris. In comparison, we used 1 min ultrasonication
to generate eEVs and then immediatelycarried out centrifugation.

On the other hand, investigation of EV contents that can modulate
cellular processes is also important as it would shed light on the
underlying mechanisms responsible for skin treatments.31 Stem cell-derived EVs influence the recipient
cells by delivering biologically active molecules like growth factors,
transcription factors, and nucleic acids, of which RNA is most abundantly
found in EVs in the form of mRNAs, miRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and
circular RNAs.20,32−34 Recent studies
further demonstrated that EVs can effectively wrap dsDNA, ssDNA, mtDNA,
and retrotransposon elements.33 The composition
of these DNA materials has sparked interest in the potential for horizontal
gene transfer by EVs. Nevertheless, while few reports have examined
the DNA content of EVs, the RNA and protein contents of EVs have been
studied extensively. Numerous studies have been done to understand
the underlying mechanism of EVs in skin treatments, which has led
to the identification of various EV contents like proteins and RNAs
as well as signaling pathways. The delivery of these bioactive molecules
then triggers a signaling pathway that can potentially cause EV-mediated
skin treatment. For example, Ti et al. reported that miR-21, miR-146a,
and miR-181 from hucMSC-derived EVs regulate inflammation and promote
tissue regeneration with the help of TLR and IL-6 signaling pathways.35 Similarly, Zhang et al. reported that EVs derived
from human endothelial progenitor cells accelerate cutaneous wound
healing by promoting angiogenesis through erk1/2 signaling. Fang et
al. confirmed that EV miRNAs from umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal
stem cells suppressed myofibroblast differentiation by inhibiting
the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway during wound healing.36 Moreover, many other stem cell-derived molecules, including
miR-21-3p,37 miR-125a,38 α-2-macroglobulin,39 Wnt4,40 MALAT1,41 and many
others, have been identified that can promote skin wound healing.42−50 Based on these findings, EV RNAs and proteins seem to greatly contribute
to EV-mediated skin treatment. The EV RNAs in recipient cells can
regulate the expression of the target gene. Meanwhile, the presence
of EV proteins can directly promote the proliferation and migration
of recipient cells that stimulate skin regeneration. Of note, the
mechanism in skin regeneration and rejuvenation is very complex and
difficult to explain with a single molecule or signaling pathway alone.
Thus, in future studies, it is necessary to investigate the potential
mechanisms by exploring the full spectrum of signaling networks in
detail along with developing a better understanding of biofunctions
of various EV contents. Moreover, this approach and hucMSC-derived
eEVs potentially can be translated into skin treatment, such as radiation-induced
acute skin damage and diabetic foot ulcer.

4 Conclusions
Our results demonstrated
that eEVs derived from hucMSC using ultrasonication
can be efficiently, rapidly, and massively produced. This simple approach
overcomes the low-yield concern. The generated eEVs have similar biological
functions as nsEVs. In the following serial comparative tests, we
demonstrated that eEVs can promote HDFs’ proliferation and
migration, increase key ECM proteins’ expression, and inhibit
the MMP-1/MMP-3 expression when HDFs receive high-dose UVB in vitro.
We further demonstrated that these nsEVs can promote wound healing
in animal models. To sum up, we conclude that hucMSC-derived eEVs
with ultrasonication can preserve and deliver the useful components
of hucMSCs to dermal tissue and thereby can promote skin regeneration
and rejuvenation.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Cell Culture
The hucMSCs and HDFs
were purchased from ATCC. The hucMSCs were cultured with a low-glucose
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing
2.4 nM l-glutamine, 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/mL
rhFGF, and 5 ng/mL rhEGF. The HDFs were cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS
and penicillin/streptomycin. Both were cultured at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

5.2 Isolation and Characterization of EVs
The hucMSCs with 80% confluence were cultured without FBS for an
additional 48 h. In total, 400 mL of medium was centrifuged at 2500g for 15 min. The supernatant was subsequently filtered
using a 0.22 μm filter, followed by UC at 350 000g and 4 °C for 4 h. The nsEV pellet was resuspended
in 2 mL of PBS. To produce eEVs, ∼1 × 108 husMSCs
were resuspended in 2 mL of PBS, followed by ultrasonication with
an ultrasonic homogenizer (950E, Scientz) using a 0.125 in. tip at
4 °C. Power of 500 W was used for the generation of eEVs, and
the frequency was 20–25 kHz. Ultrasonication was on for 2 s
to shear cells and off for an additional 2 s to cool down the local
temperature. The amplitude ranging from 20 to 40% was optimized first,
and then treatment time ranging from 1 to 5 min was optimized. After
ultrasonication, the sample was centrifuged at 20 000g for 30 min, followed by filtration with a 0.22 μm
filter. All of the collected EV samples were then stored at −80
°C. Next, EVs were routinely characterized with TEM (Hitachi
H-7650). Protein markers, including CD9, CD63, and CD81, were identified
with Western blot. Nanosight NS300 was used to measure the size distribution
and concentration of EVs.

5.3 Cell Assays and Measurement of ECM Proteins
HDFs that were educated with 200 μg/mL nsEVs or eEVs for
3 consecutive days served as the experimental group, whereas HDFs
routinely cultured were used as the control. Approximately 2 ×
103 HDFs were seeded per well in a 96-well plate and cultured
with 2% FBS. At 0, 24, and 48 h timepoints, cells in each group were
photographed, respectively, and counted by ImageJ. Transwell migration
assay was also used to measure the migration ability of HDFs. Briefly,
HDFs were plated at 2 × 104 cells/200 μL in
FBS-free DMEM onto upper chambers in a transwell insert (Corning)
and 500 μL of DMEM with 5% FBS were added to the lower chamber.
After incubation for 48 h, nonmigration cells were removed with cotton
swabs. Moreover, in the wound-healing assay, HDFs were seeded at 2
× 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate and cultured
overnight. The cells were then scratched with a 1 mL pipette tip when
merged completely, followed by rinsing with PBS to remove the detached
cells. To evaluate wound closure, the width of the wound was recorded
and analyzed with ImageJ. Cells at the bottom of the membrane were
stained with neutral red dye for 10 min, followed by imaging. In each
group, 3 × 105 HDFs were harvested and the soluble
collagen and fibronectin in the supernatant and elastin were measured
with the collagen assay kit (ab242291, Abcam), fibronectin immunoassay
(DFBN10, R&D Systems), and the elastin ELISA kit (ab239433, Abcam),
respectively.

5.4 UVB Irradiation and Measurement of MMP RNA
In each group, HDFs were plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well and cultured overnight. Cells were treated
with UVB using an EL Series UV lamp 8 W (UVP) for 10 s at a dose of
0.05 J/cm2, with a spectral peak of 302 nm, once a day
for 3 consecutive days. Thereafter, cells were thoroughly rinsed with
PBS and further cultured with or without EVs in DMEM for 48 h. Then,
cells were collected for RNA extraction. Sixty nanograms of mRNA of
each sample was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript
First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher). Primers for MMP-1 (F:
CAT CGT GTT GCA GCT CAT GA; R: ATG GGC TGG ACA GGA TTT TG), MMP-3
(F: TGC TGC TCA TGA AAT TGG CC; R: TCA TCT TGA GAC AGG CGG AA), and
β-actin (F: GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC CAC; R: CTC CTT AAT GTC
ACG CAC GAT TT) were purchased from IDT. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification was performed at 94 °C for 3 min, and then
45 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C
for 1 min. Following amplification, the reactions were subjected to
a thermal melt from 55 to 95 °C in 0.5 °C increments, and
FAM fluorescence was monitored at each increment. The expression levels
of candidate RNAs were normalized using actin as the endogenous control.
The relative quantitative expression levels of RNAs were determined
by the 2–ΔΔCt method. Concentrations
of MMP-1 and MMP-3 were detected by the ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Cusabio).

5.5 Wound-Healing Model In Vivo
Six BALB/c
mice divided into each group were used for the study. Mice were anesthetized
and the dorsal hair was shaved. A full-thickness excisional wound
of ∼4 mm diameter was created. Thereafter, mice were individually
caged without dressing. Mice were then intradermally injected with
100 μL of PBS, 200 μg of eEVs in 200 μL of PBS,
and 200 μg of nsEVs in 200 μL of PBS, respectively, at
multiple sites around the wound. The wound-healing process was monitored
by taking digital photographs of wounds on days 0, 5, 9, and 14. ImageJ
was used to measure the area of the wound. The percentage of wound
closure was calculated by  

5.6 Statistical Analysis
Results are
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons
were performed by Student’s t-test or ANOVA.
A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
