Environmentally stable
lead halide perovskite nanostructures with
engineered composition and morphology are attractive because of their
exotic optical properties. Here, we report the synthesis of monodispersed
(∼20 nm) CsPbI3 cubic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs)
using edible olive oil as a solvent as well as a chelating reagent.
Thereafter, bromide anion exchange reaction using the cetyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide surfactant in hexane is carried out at relatively
lower temperatures to synthesize caesium lead halide perovskites with
variable halide compositions and tunable band gaps. Interestingly,
because of the formation of micelles, continuous morphology evolution
varying from NCs of different sizes to nanowires (NWs) and nanosheets
is observed. The anion exchange temperature has a distinct effect
on the morphology of the CsPbBr3 nanostructure and the
anion exchange reaction rate. Finally, an easy solution-processed
photoconductive device is demonstrated using as-grown CsPbBr3 NWs, indicating its potential for optoelectronic applications.

Introduction
Inorganic caesium lead
halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have
attracted immense attention because of their incredible optical properties,
high quantum yield of emission, and tunable band gap by varying the
halide composition1 and cations. Mixed
methyl-ammonium and formamidinium (FA) lead halide (MAPbX3, FAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite-based solar cells
have been reported to achieve an exciting 22% power conversion efficiency,2 though they suffer from stability toward moisture3,4 and temperature beyond 100 °C.5 Recently,
it has been reported that the thin films of organic FA and inorganic
caesium (Cs) cation mixtures are structurally and thermally stable
above 100 °C.6 Li et al. have reported
that the stability of the FAPbI3 can be improved by Cs
doping.7 Similarly, Wang et al. demonstrated
direct colloidal synthesis of stable FA and caesium-based double cation
lead halide perovskite with controllable morphology.8 To improve the thermal stability of the perovskite, the
organic part needs to be fully replaced by an inorganic cation such
as Cs. The fully inorganic perovskite materials have now drawn much
attention for both photovoltaic and light-emitting-based device applications.

Colloidal CsPbX3 NCs have a unique ability of anion
exchange reaction, which opens a new door to tune the size-controlled
band gap and for studying interesting chemical and physical properties.
By postsynthesis chemical engineering, the composition as well as
optical properties9−11 can be tuned by cation and anion exchange reactions.
In most of the cases the precursors are highly reactive; which spontaneously
undergo anion exchange, when they come in contact with the NCs. Ramasamy
et al.12 reported a postsynthesis anion
exchange reaction of CsPbX3 using LiX at room temperature.
Benzoyl halide,13 Grignard reagents (MeMgX),9 oleylammonium halides (OAmX),14 and tertiary butyl ammonium halide (TBAX)15 have also been used as alternative precursors for postsynthesis
anion exchange reaction.

Morphology of the CsPbX3 nanostructures, viz., NCs,
nanosheets (NSs), nanowires (NWs), and so on, can be engineered by
varying the reaction condition and temperature. There are a few reports
on the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) CsPbX3 NSs by
varying the hydrocarbon chain length of the primary amine or tuning
the ligand precursor ratio.16,17 Pan1 et al.18 systematically studied
the effect of the carbon chain length on the surface chemistry as
well as morphologies of the perovskite NCs. Seth and Samanta reported
a sequential change in morphology by varying different parameters
such as amount of oleylamine, addition of antisolvents, and the reaction
time.19 Zhang et al.10 reported the formation of CsPbX3 NWs by anion
exchange reaction using CsPbBr3 NWs as the template and
PbX2 or OAmX as the anion source. Even incident light had
resulted in compositional and structural transition from orthorhombic
CsPbBr3 to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 NSs
and vice versa.20 To the best of the authors’
knowledge there are no reports where the compositions as well as morphology
are tailored simultaneously in an anion exchange reaction.

Here,
in this report, we present the compositional variation and
morphological evolution of CsPbX3 perovskites by varying
the halide precursors in an anion exchange reaction, which have resulted
in tunable optical properties. CsPbI3 NCs of uniform size
have been synthesized using edible olive oil as a solvent as well
as a ligand, by replacing oleic acid. Thereafter, postsynthetic anion
exchange reaction of CsPbI3 has been performed using cetyl
trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a bromide ion precursor. With
the variation of anion exchange reaction temperature, the reaction
rate drastically increases accompanied with a morphological change
of perovskite NCs to NWs and NSs. The optical characteristics and
photoconducting properties of solution-processed CsPbBr3 NWs are presented to evaluate their potential applications in optoelectronic
devices.

Results and Discussions
A colloidal solution of CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs in hexane
has been synthesized using edible olive oil. In the process, oleic
acid present in olive oil forms caesium-oleate as well as lead-oleate.
Oleylamine used in the synthesis process helps in the formation of
an OLAm–X complex and simultaneously stabilizes the NCs in
the colloidal solution.9

Anion exchange
reaction has been carried out using CTAB as the
surfactant and a bromide ion source, to achieve tunable absorption
and emission properties. The schematic of the CsPbBr3 NW
formation during anion exchange reaction is shown in Figure 1. The quaternary cetyl tertiary
ammonium cation (CTA+) of CTAB is a soft acid because of
the absence of the hydrogen atom.21 On
the other hand, iodide anion is the softest base among the halide
group because of its highly polarizable nature. According to the hard
soft acid base principle, a hard–hard and soft–soft
combination is favorable for the formation of a stable adduct. Therefore,
the iodide ion of perovskite prefers to attach with the CTA+ to form a comparatively stable adduct. Simultaneously, the vacant
position of iodide ion is occupied by the bromide ion.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
CTAB-assisted anion exchange reaction of CsPbI3 to CsPbBr3 at 60 °C.

To get an insight into the anion exchange reaction, the reaction
temperature has been varied using 45 mg of CTAB and the reaction kinetics
has been studied by UV–visible (Figure 2) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
(Figure 3). Figure 2 shows the evolution
of absorption spectra describing the formation CsPbBr3 from
CsPbI3 sequentially at three different reaction temperatures
(60, 80, and 100 °C). CsPbI3 exhibits absorption in
the broad region of the visible wavelengths. The PL spectrum of CsPbI3 exhibits an asymmetric emission peak, which converts to a
symmetric one after incorporation of Br into the host crystal. This
indicates that, initially, compositional defects are present in CsPbI3.22 A similar asymmetric PL spectrum
was reported by Lee et al., because of the presence of both cation
and anion vacancies in perovskite NCs.23 It is observed that with the increase in temperature, the rate of
reaction increases drastically (Figure 2d). Similar results are also observed in PL spectra
acquired at 3 min intervals while monitoring the anion exchange reactions.
Initially, CsPbI3 shows a sharp emission peak at 680 nm,
which is gradually shifted to 545 nm for CsPbBr3, indicating
full conversion from iodide to bromide. Figure 3d shows the sequential digital images as
a function of time for CsPbBr3 formation from CsPbI3 at 60 °C. Two control experiments at room temperature
and 0 °C have been carried out to confirm the role of temperature.
At room temperature it takes almost 4–5 days for partial anion
exchange before degradation of the perovskite structure (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). However, at 0 °C,
the reaction does not occur at all and the solution remains almost
unchanged after 15 days (Figure S2b, Supporting Information). Almost 40 min is required to complete the anion
exchange at 60 °C (Figure 2a), whereas 30 min is enough at 80 °C (Figure 2b) for the completion of anion
exchange reaction. The completion time further decreases to 15 min
at 100 °C (Figure 2c). The rate of the reaction can be monitored indirectly through
the change of the band gap with time, as presented in Figure 2d. The rate of the change of
band gap is calculated to be 0.0186, 0.0297, and 0.032 eV/min at 60,
80, and 100 °C, respectively. This clearly indicates that the
rate of anion exchange reaction with CTAB is strongly temperature-dependent.

There are two reasons for the
increase of reaction rate with temperature.
The rate of formation of the reverse micelle mainly depends on the
solubility of the surfactant as well as the Kraft temperature, the
temperature above which micelle formation occurs at a certain concentration
of the surfactant. This Kraft temperature depends on the polarity
of the solvent as well as the nonpolar chain of the surfactant.24 With increase in reaction temperature, the solubility
of CTAB increases, resulting in enhanced probability of micelle formation.
The second reason for the increase in the rate of reaction with temperature
is the activation energy. With the increase in temperature, CTAB molecules
are activated for the anion exchange reaction, which leads to the
enhancement of the reaction rate at higher temperatures. We have also
performed a time-resolved PL decay study of the anion exchange product
using 45 mg of CTAB at 60 °C (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). The PL decay lifetime of the nanostructures
depends on the compositions, size, morphology, and surface state present
in the system. Sun et al. reported the average PL decay lifetime for
a CsPbBr3 nanocube of 1–22 ns.25 Initially, the PL decay lifetime for CsPbI3 NCs
is found to be 43.2 ns and after full transformation (40 min) to CsPbBr3 the PL decay lifetime decreases to 12.1 ns, clearly supporting
the anion exchange process. The decay time of CsPbI3 NCs
is found to be longer than that of CsPbBr3 NWs, indicating
the presence of a defect state in CsPbI3 NCs. Similarly,
a longer decay lifetime was observed by Ding et al. because of the
presence of a defect state in MAPbI3 crystals.26

Simultaneously, the evolution of morphology
of the samples has
been monitored through the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis, as displayed in Figure 4.

Figure 4 TEM image of CsPbI3 NCs (a), CsPbBr3 NWs
at 60 °C (b), CsPbBr3 NSs at 80 °C (c), and degraded
CsPbBr3 NCs at 100 °C (d). SAED patterns of CsPbI3 NCs (e), CsPbBr3 NWs (f), CsPBr3 NSs
(g), and degraded CsPbBr3 NCs (h). Lattice fringe patterns
of CsPbI3 NCs (i), CsPbBr3 NWs (j), CsPBr3 NSs (k), and degraded CsPbBr3 NCs (l).

Interestingly, the reaction temperature influences
the morphology
of the lead halide perovskite. Figure 4b shows the TEM micrograph of few-micron-long CsPbBr3 NWs with a diameter of ∼200 nm synthesized at 60 °C.
Rhombus-shaped 2D flakes of size ∼150 × 150 nm are obtained
at 80 °C (Figure 4c). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and high-resolution
lattice fringe patterns of the sample grown at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 4e–h,i–l, respectively. From the SAED pattern, high
crystallinity of the NCs, NWs, and NSs are found. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) lattice fringe pattern shows
an interplanar spacing of 0.62 (Figure 4i) and 0.29 nm (Figure 4j–l) corresponding to the (100) plane of CsPbI3 and (110) plane of CsPbBr3, respectively. The
shapes of the NCs are distorted at 100 °C, because of the degradation
of the perovskite NCs.

Seth and Samanta27 reported the synthesis
of the CsPbBr6 nanostructure of different morphologies
by a surfactant-mediated antisolvent precipitation method. CTAB preferentially
binds to the (110) plane as compared to the (300) one, which leads
to the formation of NWs as CTAB concentration increases to a saturation
level. In microemulsion technique, surfactants result in thermodynamically
stable reverse micelles in a nonpolar solvent.28 Similarly, the polar head group of CTAB and perovskite
NCs forms the inner core of a cylindrical/lamellar reverse micelle
in nonpolar hexane during anion exchange reaction. As a result, CsPbBr3 NWs are obtained as shown schematically in Figure 1 at 60 °C. To get an insight
into the formation of micelle and particle size distribution, we have
performed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements for the product
of anion exchange reaction at 60, 80, and 100 °C (Figure S8). We have also performed DLS measurement
during the anion exchange reaction at different times at 60 °C.
The average micelle size for initial (at 0 min) CsPbI3 NCs
with CTAB is found to be 20–25 nm. After 15 min, the micelle
size increases to 1–2 μm possibly due to the formation
CsPbBrxI3–x NWs by partial halide exchange (Figure S9). The average particle size after anion exchange at 60 °C
is found to be above 3–4 μm after completion of the reaction.
The average size at 80 and 100 °C is found to be ∼1–1.5
μm and 30–40 nm, respectively. The results agree well
with the particle size extracted from TEM analysis.

The size
and shape of the reverse micelle strongly depend upon
the temperature. A rise in temperature causes an increase of micelle
aggregation number. Simultaneously, with the increase in temperature,
the radii of the micelle also increase with a broader size distribution,
leading to the formation of rod- or plate-shaped micelles.29 Similarly, a morphology change from small cubic
NCs to long NWs and larger NSs is also observed in this study. However,
any further increase in temperature causes the degradation of perovskites
(CsPbI3 NC) before completion of the anion exchange reaction.
Pradhan et al. have also observed spontaneous transformation of CsPb(BrxI1–x)3 nanocubes to NWs because of partial removal of oleic acid
and oleylamine ligands, which facilitates the growth along the ⟨002⟩
direction.30

Further, three different
amounts of CTAB (30, 45, and, 60 mg) have
been employed for anion exchange and the process was monitored by
UV–visible and PL spectroscopy. It is observed that the concentration
of CTAB does not affect the rate of the reaction (Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information). Almost the same time
duration is required for the completion of anion exchange reaction
at 60 °C. As CTAB is sparingly soluble in hexane, at different
CTAB concentrations, the solubility remains almost the same at 60
°C. That is why for all the cases, almost the same duration is
required for the completion of anion exchange reaction. However, with
the increase in amount of CTAB from 30 to 60 mg, the density of CsPbBr3 NWs increases, as evident from the TEM image (Figures S4
and S7, Supporting Information).

The crystalline quality of CsPbBr3 NWs has been studied
through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD patterns of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 synthesized at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 5. The characteristics peak for the (100) plane of CsPbI3 is observed at 14.1°. The above peak is shifted to 14.8°
for CsPbBr3 NWs because of the smaller atomic size of Br
compared to I. During anion exchange at different temperatures, the
peak position for CsPbBr3 (100) remains almost unchanged
but the full width at half-maximum of the peak for the (100) plane
changes largely. The main difference between the orthorhombic and
cubic phases is the appearance of an additional shoulder peak at ∼30°.31 The XRD results clearly indicate the formation
of an orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3 NWs at 60 °C.
The shoulder peak is found to be almost vanished in the case of CsPbBr3 at 80 and 100 °C, confirming the cubic phase of CsPbBr3. However, XRD patterns at different temperatures indicate
that the crystallinity of the sample is degraded with the increase
in anion exchange reaction temperature from 60 to 100 °C. This
observation agrees well with the SAED patterns.

Figure 5 Typical XRD patterns
of CsPbI3 NCs and CsPbBr3 NWs and NSs after
anion exchange reaction at 60 and 80 °C (asterisk
peaks are due to the presence of CTAB shown in Figure S10).

To demonstrate potential application of CsPbBr3 NWs,
a photoconductive device on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass has
been fabricated. The schematic of the fabricated device is shown in Figure 6a. The cross-sectional
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image (inset of Figure 6a) of the device
shows the thickness of each layer. The photoresponse of the fabricated
device is studied under white light illumination using a solar simulator
at different voltages, as shown in Figure 6. The fabricated device shows almost a 2
order change in current under the illumination, as shown in Figure 6b. The device shows
a moderately high on–off ratio (46) at 2 V in Figure 6c. Responsivity is a useful
parameter to describe the efficiency of a photoconductive device.
The responsivity curve in Figure 6d shows a broad visible response from 400 to 550 nm,
with a maximum responsivity of 0.28 A/W at 520 nm. The peak at 520
nm is attributed to the direct band edge absorption in CsPbBr3 NWs.

characteristics of the fabricated device under dark and white light
illumination, (c) switching characteristics of the device at 0 and
2 V, and (d) responsivity curve of the CsPbBr3-based photoconductive
detector device.

The external quantum
efficiency (EQE) is a very important parameter
to evaluate the performance of a photoconductive device. EQE is defined
as the ratio of numbers of charge carriers generated compared to the
numbers of photons of particular incident energy on the device at
a particular wavelength. The EQE spectrum of the fabricated device
is shown in the Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The fabricated device shows a high EQE of ∼70% at an applied
bias of 2 V at 520 nm.

Conclusions
In this article, a monodispersed
CsPbI3 NC of an average
size of ∼20 nm is synthesized using edible olive oil. We have
performed the bromide exchange reaction using CTAB, as a bromide source
to obtain CsPbBr3, from CsPbI3 NCs. A sequential
transformation to CsPbBr3 from CsPbI3 is observed
through UV–visible and PL spectroscopy. Interestingly, a simultaneous
evolution of nanostructures with different morphologies is observed
because of the formation of different shaped micelles by varying the
anion exchange temperature. TEM and XRD analyses reveal the formation
of high-quality CsPbI3 NCs, long CsPbBr3 NWs,
and 2D NSs, resulting in tunable optical band gap and emission characteristics.
Finally, we have successfully fabricated a CsPbBr3 NW-based
(ITO/CsPbBr3NWs/spiro-OMeTAD/Al) photoconductive detector
through solution processing, which exhibits optical switching and
moderate responsivity in the visible region, paving the way for fabricating
future optoelectronic devices.

Experimental Section
Materials and Chemicals
All the chemicals of analytical
grade, including caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3,
99.9%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), olive oil (90%), oleylamine
(OAm, 70%), n-hexane (99%), and CTAB were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

Preparation
of Caesium-Oleate
Cs2CO3 (0.814 g,
0.002 mol) was dispersed with 40 mL of olive oil
in a two-necked round-bottom flask (rbf). The rbf was degassed under
vacuum at 120 °C for 15 min and filled with nitrogen. Following
this, the dispersion was heated to 150 °C to form a semitransparent
solution under N2. The Cs-oleate solution was kept at 100
°C before injection into the lead-oleate solution in the next
step to avoid precipitation.

Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Br, I)
NCs
Olive
oil (5 mL) and PbI2 (870 mg, 0.188 mol) or PbBr2 (690 mg) or PbCl2 (520 mg) were taken in a 25 mL two-necked
rbf and evacuated under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h. Oleyl amine
(0.5 mL) was injected swiftly under nitrogen at 120 °C. The temperature
of the reaction mixture was raised to 150 °C for solubilization
of PbI2 to form lead-oleate. Finally, pre-heated (at 100
°C) Cs-oleate (4 mL) solution was injected into the semitransparent
lead-oleate solution. After 5 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in
an ice bath to stop the reaction. The resultant crude solution was
centrifuged at 20 000 rpm to get the precipitate as CsPbI3 NCs. A clear solution of CsPbI3 NCs was obtained
after adding 20 mL of hexane to the crude NCs.

Material Characterization
The surface morphology of
CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskite was investigated
using HRTEM (model no. JEM-2100, detector CCD camera from Gatan, Inc.
USA, operating voltage 200 kV from JEOL, Japan). The UV–visible
absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and CsPbI3 NCs by hot injection approach
was recorded using a fiber-probe-based UV–vis–NIR CCD
spectrometer. The crystallinity of as-synthesized perovskite NCs,
NWs, and NSs was studied using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer
(model No Philips X’Pert MRD). PL and PL decay of all perovskite
samples were obtained by using a 376 nm excitation wavelength.

Anion
Exchange Reaction
Anion exchange reaction of
CsPbI3 in hexane was performed at different temperatures.
Of the as-prepared CsPbI3 solution in hexane, 10 mL, and
known amounts (30, 45, 60 mg) of CTAB were taken in a 25 mL rbf. The
reaction mixture was kept in a closed vessel by sealing and stirred
at desired temperatures (0, 60, 80, and 100 °C and room temperature).
After 3 min intervals, 0.1 mL of the reaction mixture was taken out
using a syringe to study the changes of the optical property at different
durations.

Device Fabrication
Photoconductive
devices were fabricated
using as-grown CsPbBr3 NWs on an ITO-coated glass substrate.
CsPbBr3 NWs were deposited on precleaned ITO-coated glass
substrates by spin-coating (2000 rpm for 15 s) to obtain a thickness
of ∼250 nm. The perovskite-coated ITO substrates were dried
at 60 °C for 1 h in an oven. A mixture of spiro-OMeTD/Li-TFSi
(70 mg spiro-OMeTD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, 45 μL of LiTFSi
in acetonitrile (170 mg/mL), and 10 μL of tBP) solution was
spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 15 s. Bilayer-coated
ITO substrates were dried at 60 °C for 30 min. The Al electrode
was deposited (dia ≈ 0.1 mm) as a top contact by thermal evaporation
with a base pressure of 2 × 10–6 Torr. Current–voltage
(I–V) measurements were performed
using a Keithley 4200-A semiconductor parameter analyzer and a solar
simulator as the light source.
