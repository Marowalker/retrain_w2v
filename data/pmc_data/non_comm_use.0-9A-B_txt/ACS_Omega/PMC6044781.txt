Human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA
stabilization has emerged as an
exciting novel approach for anticancer drug development. In the present
study, we have designed and synthesized three C2-symmetric
bisubstituted bisbenzimidazole naphthalenediimide (NDI) ligands, ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, and BBZ-AROCH2, which stabilize human
telomeric G-quadruplex DNA with high affinity. Herein, we have studied
the binding affinities and thermodynamic contributions of each of
these molecules with G-quadruplex DNA and compared the same to those
of the parent NDI analogue, BMSG-SH-3. Results of fluorescence
resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance demonstrate
that these ligands have a higher affinity for G4-DNA over
duplex DNA and induce the formation of a G-quadruplex. The binding
equilibrium constants obtained from the microcalorimetry studies of BBZ-ARO, ALI-C3, and BBZ-AROCH2 were 8.47, 6.35, and 3.41
μM, respectively, with h-telo 22-mer quadruplex.
These showed 10 and 100 times lower binding affinity with h-telo 12-mer and duplex DNA quadruplexes, respectively.
Analysis of the thermodynamic parameters obtained from the microcalorimetry
study suggests that interactions were most favorable for BBZ-ARO among all of the synthesized compounds. The ΔGfree obtained from molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area calculations of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies
suggest that BBZ-ARO interacted strongly with G4-DNA. MD simulation results showed the highest hydrogen bond occupancy
and van der Waals interactions were between the side chains of BBZ-ARO and the DNA grooves. A significant inhibition of telomerase
activity (IC50 = 4.56 μM) and induced apoptosis in
cancer cell lines by BBZ-ARO suggest that this molecule
has the potential to be developed as an anticancer agent.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes are
stable secondary structures of nucleic acids
(DNA as well as RNA) adapted by guanine-rich sequences, which affect
gene regulation, chromatin architecture, and genomic stability.1−6 Human telomeric DNA has repeated d(TTAGGG) sequences, which cap
the ends of chromosomes to protect them during replication from deleterious
processes.7 Telomeres are maintained by
telomerase and have been found to be present in tumor cells. It is
well known that the formation of a G-quadruplex in telomeres inhibits
the telomerase activity and imparts immortality to the cancer cells.8 Because telomerase is not found in most normal
somatic cells, telomeric G-quadraplex stabilization is a strategic
approach to inhibit telomerase activity in tumor cells to design anticancer
agents.9−12 A rational design for small molecules targeting DNA G-quadruplexes
requires knowledge about the structure of the G-quadruplex and the
ligand–quadruplex interaction. Although a number of small molecules
have been studied as G-quadruplex-binding ligands, most of them were
studied with a prefolded static G-quadruplex; most of the human G-quadruplexes
are unstructured dynamic sequences, and except naphthalenediimide
(NDI), none of the molecules have reached the in vivo evaluation stage.
Hence, a continuous search for small molecules is required for the
development of anticancer drugs, which not only induce G-quadruplex
formation, but also target different G-quadruplex sequences in human
genomes. Considerable efforts have been made to seek effective G-quadruplex
binders, such as BRACO-19,13 RHPS4,14 Telomestatin,15 TMPyP4,16 and so on, from the library of natural products.
Synthetic compounds, such as quinobenzoxazine,17 coronene,18 naphthalimide, NDI,19 isoalloxazine,20 anthraquinone,21 spermines,22 and
recently carbazole23,24 ligands with carboxamide side
chains have been shown to be nucleus-imaging probes, which selectively
stabilize the c-MYC G-quadruplex. A number of di- and tetrasubstituted
derivatives of NDI have been extensively studied for stabilizing the
G-quadruplex.25−27 Four side chains on NDI make its structure too sterically
hindered
and rigid to bind to quadruplex grooves.28 Recently, novel NDI derivatives have been found to show anticancer
activities.29,30 Doria et al. synthesized a water-soluble
NDI by fusing 1,4-dihydro-pyrazine-2,3-dione with two cationic or
anionic chains at the imide moiety.31 Similarly,
quinonemethides were tethered to NDI to convert them to G-quadruplex
alkylating agents.32 An NDI derivative
showed antitumor activity in a pancreatic cancer animal model and
increased the survival of animals, suggesting in vivo efficacy of
G-quadruplex-stabilizing agents.33

In the present study, we have designed and synthesized three derivatives
of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dimide (NDI) as G-quadruplex-stabilizing
ligands; ALI-C3 (10) (2,7-bis(3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl)benzo
[lmn] [3,8]phenanthroline-,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone), BBZ-ARO (11) (2,7-bis(4-(6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)-benzo-[lmn][3,8] Phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone), and BBZ-AROCH2 (12) (2,7-bis((6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2yl)methyl)benzo-[lmn][3,8]-phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (Scheme 1). Herein, we have studied their interactions
with two different quadruplexes, inter-strand 12-mer and an intra-strand
22-mer, and compared the results with those of the parent molecule BMSG-SH-3 (Figure 1A). BBZ-ARO and BBZ-AROCH2 have a benzimidazole ring along with piperazine in the side chain,
whereas ALI-C3 has piperazine with three methylenic
groups as side chains on two sides of the NDI ring. The molecules
synthesized by us showed an increased aromaticity leading to increased
end-stacking with G-quadruplex, and the structure with an aliphatic
carbon chain provides flexibility to behave as a groove binder. As
benzimidazole is structurally isosteric to purine bases, it readily
interacts with biomolecules and increases the cell permeability of
the ligand.33 Benzimidazole–carbazole
conjugates are reported to have a high binding affinity to G4-DNA,34 and the benzimidazole carboxamide
derivatives of pyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline and 1,8-naphthyridine,
specifically stabilize quadruplex DNA.35,36

Our data suggest that, among the three molecules synthesized, BBZ-ARO containing bisbenzimidazole side chains is the most
potent molecule in terms of affinity toward quadruplex over the duplex
DNA. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies were
further used for structural insight. We carried out molecular mechanics
Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) free energy calculations
on all of the inter- and intramolecular systems to find out the actual
affinities of the ligands and to correlate experimental observations.
The therapeutic efficacy was validated by a TRAP-Lig assay, and the
cell cycle analysis was validated by flow cytometry and a Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis assay.

Results
Synthesis of Bisubstituted
NDIs
In the present study,
we synthesized an intermediate compound, N-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,2-phenylenediamine (1), starting from m-chloroaniline, using
a reported procedure,37 and then this intermediate
was refluxed with 2 and 3 to produce benzimidazole
derivatives 6 and 7. Compounds 6 and 7 were condensed with 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic
acid anhydride (8) to yield BBZ-ARO (11) and BBZ-AROCH2(12). We were able to synthesize the tetrasubstituted parent analogue BMSG-SH-3 (14) from 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic
acid dianhydride (13) either as a starting amine or heating
it at 150 °C for 10 min in a microwave oven. We used 3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)
propan-1-amine (9) as a starting amine for the synthesis
of ALI-C3(10) from
the commercially available intermediate 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic
acid dianhydride (13). We could not synthesize BBZ-ARO and BBZ-AROCH2 using 13 because of the degradation of the final product
in a microwave oven. To optimize the reaction conditions, different
solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), iPr-OH, and glacial AcOH, were tried for the final step (Scheme 1) of the synthesis
of the ligands, but the highest yield was obtained from glacial acetic
acid with a formidable 12 h reaction time. We could not isolate the
final product by the microwave method, as reported earlier by Neidle
et al.38 The products started to degrade
within 10–15 min at 150 W. The solid precipitate was filtered
first, washed with glacial acetic acid, and crystallized from DMF/H2O (2:1) and acetic acid separately. The characterization of
the compounds using NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
is described in Figures S1–S26.

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Melting Assay
Shows a Strong Binding Preference of BBZ-ARO toward G-Quadruplexes
over Duplex DNA
FRET melting results suggest that three ligands
display moderate to high stability for human telomeric repeats with
G4-conformation. We first monitored by “FAM”
and “TAMRA” the melting temperature of a FAM-tagged
G-quadruplex (F22T, 5′-[6FAM]-AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-[TAM]-3′,
and F12T, 5′-[6FAM]-TAGGGTTAGGGT-[TAM]-3′) at increasing
concentration of ligand (up to 2 μM) (Figure 1B, Table 1). The FRET melting temperatures were observed as 64.4
and 52.5 °C for F22T and F12T, respectively (Figure S27). There was a slight decrease in the fluorescence
intensity in the temperature range of 90–75 °C in the
annealing profile of the mixture of G/C-rich strands in the absence
of ligands (black curves). However, there was an increase in fluorescence
intensities below 75 °C with a subsequent decrease in the temperature
(58–37 °C in the case of the F22T-compl 22 system and
48–37 °C in the case of the F12T-compl 12 system). The
fluorescence profile of the donor intensity monitored for the mixture
of the GC-rich strand in the presence of 2 μM of each ligand
shows a shift of the melting profile to a higher temperature. The
small change in the fluorescence intensity of the donor in the presence
of ligands indicates a lower population of the duplex. The competitive
environment caused by the presence of duplex DNA favors quadruplex
formation with most ligands, as we found that the melting temperature
of F22T increases to 16 from 14 °C in the case of BBZ-ARO. The same trends of stability increment were found in the case of
F12T and with ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2.

Thermodynamic
Parameters Suggest the Highest Binding Affinity
of BBZ-ARO with G-Quadruplexes
The interaction
of small molecules with macromolecules can be thermodynamically characterized
by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).39,40 The appropriate heat values obtained from the injection of the same
concentration of ligand solution into the duplex/quadruplex are presented
in Figure 2. ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3 bound to h-telo 22-mer quadruplex exhibited a single
binding event. Stoichiometries were found to be 1.06, 1.27, 1.31,
and 1.05 for ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3, respectively, suggesting nearly 1:1 binding of the ligand into
the complex. BBZ-ARO shows the highest affinity of 8.4
× 106 M–1 with 22-mer quadruplex.
These ligands showed a moderate binding affinity with inter-strand h-telo 12-mer quadruplex. BBZ-ARO showed the
highest binding free energy of −7.59 kcal mol–1 among the other synthesized ligands (Table 2). Entropy factors predominate over the enthalpy
for BBZ-ARO. The control experiments of ligands with
duplex DNA showed well-equilibrated isotherms. The binding of ligands
with duplex DNA was exothermic in nature. As suggested by the single-site
model fitting of ITC data, there was only one binding event for all
four ligands. The result yielded a binding affinity of 5.0 ×
104 M–1 for BBZ-ARO with
a binding free energy value of −7.86 kcal mol–1 with DNA, suggesting that the affinity of the ligand to bind to
the duplex is lower compared to that to the quadruplex (Table 2). The ligands ALI-C3, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3, showed low affinity toward duplex
DNA over quadruplexes (Figures 2 and S28). A large enthalpy change
(ΔH°) of −15.16 kcal mol–1 and a smaller entropy contribution (TΔS°) of −8.73 kcal mol–1 were
observed for BMSG-SH-3 with 22-mer quadruplex. A moderate
binding free energy of −7.47 kcal mol–1 was
observed for BMSG-SH-3, which shows effective interaction.

Surface Plasmon Resonance
(SPR) Study Validates the Selectivity
of Synthesized Compounds toward G-Quadruplex DNA
SPR is a
useful technique for the screening of small molecules, to determine
their relative binding affinities and selectivity for a target DNA
sequence. Concentration-dependent association rate constants were
observed, whereas the ligand concentration had no effect on dissociation
rate constants. The equilibrium-binding constants (KA) obtained for the binding of ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3 were found
to be 8.7 × 106, 9.5 × 107, 1.4 ×
106, and 2.7 × 106 M–1, respectively, for h-telo 22-mer quadruplex, whereas
the corresponding values for the duplex were found to be 0.1 ×
106, 0.6 × 106, 0.4 × 106, and 0.8 × 106, respectively. The selectivities
of
the binding of ALI-C3 and BBZ-ARO with 22-mer quadruplex over DNA duplex as KAh-telo 22/KA dsDNA were found to be 87.0 and 158.3, respectively
(Table 3, Figures S29 and S30), proving the stronger binding
of ligands with the quadruplex sequence than with the duplex DNA.

BBZ-ARO Binds by End-Stacking to G-Quadruplex
ALI-C3 binds to the 22-mer
quadruplex in a 3′-end by end-stacking mode with G4, G10, G16,
and G22 tetrad, and the protonated nitrogen atoms of piperazine, N75
and N79, interacted with the phosphate backbone in the grooves. BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2,
and BMSG-SH-3 also bind by an end-stacking mode with
the quadruplex, as well as interacting with the phosphate backbone
in the grooves depending on the length of the side arms. The GLIDE
docking score of ALI-C3 was observed
to be −11.2 (Table S1) with 22-mer
G-quadruplex. The flexible side chains of ALI-C3 allow interaction with quadruplex grooves. However, BBZ-ARO shows the best docking score of −12.6 among
all four compounds synthesized with 22-mer quadruplex, which can be
explained due to the extended aromaticity. However, BBZ-AROCH2 showed a moderate score of −7.2,
as it might lose its planarity because of the absence of a phenyl
ring (Figures 3, S31, and S32). The positively charged nitrogen
atoms in both side chains in all three ligands (specifically in the
case of ALI-C3, where the side
chains are more flexible because they are aliphatic) targeted the
phosphate ions of T5, T11, and T17 of G-quadruplex (in all cases,
the phosphate groups of T-residues are interactive). Further, in the
case of the 12-mer quadruplex, the two strands mutually form a parallel
quadruplex. BMSG-SH-3 binds by end-stacking with the
G5 and G11 of one strand along with G17 and G24 of another strand.
Glide docking scores were found to be −8.3 and −9.4
for ALI-C3 and BMSG-SH-3, respectively. BBZ-ARO showed a different binding behavior
(docking score −10.4) with the 12-mer quadruplex and lay perpendicular
to the G-tetrad, (Figure 3) formed by G5, G11, G17, and G24. The piperazine rings of BBZ-ARO interacted with T12 and T24 of the 12-mer quadruplex.

In addition, we performed a flexible docking with Auto Dock
Tools
to validate the Glide docking results, using the rigid docking protocol.
Akin to previous docking, all four ligands showed an end-stacking
mode of binding with 22-mer quadruplex and showed similar docking
scores.

BBZ-ARO Stabilizes the G-Quadruplex
The
MD simulation of all four ligands with the 22-mer intra-strand and
the 12-mer inter-strand quadruplexes showed a stable binding of ligands
with the quadruplex. There was no dissociation of the ligands from
the quadruplex observed for any of the ligand–quadruplex complexes
up to 100 ns. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of the ligands,
as well as the quadruplexes, are shown in Figure S33. The RMSD of the ligands, as well as the quadruplex, showed
a converged (stable) structure throughout the complete time scale
except for BBZ-AROCH2 with 22-mer,
which showed a tendency to detach one side chain of BBZ-AROCH2 during MD. BBZ-ARO showed
the smallest RMSD (∼2 Å) with both quadruplexes due to
the high aromaticity, and was followed by the RMSD (2.8 Å) of ALI-C3. The smaller size of ALI-C3 helps it to fit appropriately
in the binding site in comparison to the size of BBZ-AROCH2, BBZ-ARO, and BMSG-SH-3. Similarly, with the 12-mer quadruplex, the RMSD values were found
to be 2.3 ± 0.27 and 1.7 ± 0.52 Å for BBZ-ARO and ALI-C3, respectively. The
extended chains of BBZ-AROCH2 are flexible and do not bind tightly to the quadruplex during the
dynamics shown in the MD videos in the Supporting Information, which was validated by the RMSD as BBZ-AROCH2 has mean deviations around 2–3 Å.
From the residue-wise root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values,
it can be easily perceived that G3, G4, G10, G11, G12, and G22 in
the case of 22-mer quadruplex, and G4, T6, G10, T12, T18, and T24
in the case of 12-mer quadruplex, have small residue fluctuations
(Figure S34), which might be due to the
interactions with corresponding ligands. BBZ-ARO showed
a higher hydrogen bond occupancy with the 22-mer quadruplex compared
to that with the 12-mer quadruplex. Both ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2 showed lower hydrogen bond occupancies with 22-mer and 12-mer quadruplexes
compared to those of BBZ-ARO (Tables 4 and S2–S4). The comparison of binding sites for two quadruplexes showed different
binding cavities. The dynamics of all four ligands during the 100
ns simulations is provided as videos in the Supporting Information. Higher fluctuations of all nucleotides were found
in the 22-mer quadruplex with all ligands as compared with those in
the 12-mer quadruplex, which was validated by hydrogen bond calculations
(Tables S2–S4).

Validation of the Stronger Binding of BBZ-ARO with
G-Quadruplex over ALI-C3, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3
by MD Simulation
The total interactions were calculated using
MM-PBSA free energy methods (Tables 4 and 5). It was observed that BBZ-ARO binds strongly to the 22-mer quadruplex, and both
electrostatic interactions, as well as van der Waals forces, are major
contributors. Besides those interactions, the central “NDI”
nucleus is involved in the stacking interaction with the G-quartet
of the 22-mer quadruplex. BBZ-ARO showed stronger van
der Waals interactions with less entropic penalties. The quads of
bases G2, G3, G4, G10, T11, G15, and G22 are the main nucleotides
that participate in the residue interaction map for all four ligands
with the 22-mer quadruplex (Table 5). ALI-C3 shows
a moderate binding with both quadruplexes compared with that of BBZ-ARO.

The binding affinity of BBZ-AROCH2 is moderately high, but it has very small electrostatic interactions,
and the van der Waals contribution is the only major factor driving
its binding affinity, specifically in the case of the 12-mer quadruplex
(Tables 4 and 6). The electrostatic interactions contribute significantly
to the total binding affinity of BMSG-SH-3 with both
the 22-mer and 12-mer quadruplexes, making it a strong binder, which
is supported by the H-bond scheme (Tables 7 and S4).

A computational
study of these ligands with 26-mer duplex DNA was
also carried out. After docking of all three ligands, along with BMSG-SH-3, followed by 50 ns MD simulation with dsDNA, ALI-C3 became completely detached
from the duplex, and the other ligands were weakly associated with
the duplex; all of the ligands were bound to the major groove of the
26-mer sequence. Comparative RMSD and RMSF profiles, along with the
simulated structures and videos of all four ligands, are shown in Figures S35 and S36.

BBZ-ARO Acts
as a Potential Telomerase Inhibitor
and Is Observed To Be Cytotoxic to Cancer Cells
The TRAP-Lig
assay is a sensitive technique that allows telomerase detection, even
with a very low telomerase activity. Effective telomerase inhibition
was checked by ligand concentration (1–50 μM). A G-quadruplex
stabilized by ligands in a TS sequence will inhibit elongation by
telomerase and hence there will be a decrease in the ladder intensity. ALI-C3 exhibited IC50 at
>50 μM along with BBZ-AROCH2, whereas BMSG-SH-3 showed inhibition at 25.4
μM. BBZ-ARO was observed to be the most potent
inhibitor, which
inhibits 50% of the telomerase activity at 4.56 μM (Figure 4 and Table 8). BBZ-ARO is more
toxic to cancerous cells than to near-normal cells. The cytotoxicity
of these ligands was determined using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium
(MTT)-based cell survival assay. Mammalian cells HeLa, A549, and HEK293T
were treated with increasing concentrations of ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3 for 48 and
72 h (BMSG-SH-3 used as the reference compound) to analyze
ligand toxicity (Table 8 and Figure S37). The IC50 values
observed for ALI-C3 were 1.4,
2.1, and 8.9 μM against A549, HeLa, and HEK293T cells, respectively,
after 72 h. BBZ-ARO demonstrated values of 19.7, 20.5,
and 63.4 μM, whereas BBZ-AROCH2 showed values of 74.8, 86.5, and >100 μM against
A549,
HeLa, and HEK293T cell lines, respectively, at 72 h. Reference compound BMSG-SH-3 showed corresponding values of 6.2, 11.4, and <0.78
μM at 72 h. BBZ-ARO displayed a better telomerase
inhibition with a considerable toxicity in the cancerous cell line
and a lower cytotoxicity in the near-normal HEK293T cells.

BBZ-ARO Causes Cell Cycle Arrest
and Apoptosis
in Cancer Cell Line
The effect of the ligands on the cell
cycle profile of the HeLa cells was evaluated using flow cytometry.
Our data revealed that BBZ-ARO and BMSG-SH-3 induced 7.6–15.8 and 21.2% G2/M phase arrest, respectively,
as compared to that of the control (Figure 5A). Similarly, ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2 showed 7.6–15.7
and 19.1% G2/M phase arrest, respectively, as compared to that of
the control. In addition, we also observed cellular accumulation in
the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle fraction (7.3% with BBZ-ARO and 2.9% with BMSG-SH-3) (Figure 5A), suggesting drug-induced apoptosis. However, ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2 did not induce any sub-G1 phase accumulation.
Further, the Annexin V assay suggested that BBZ-ARO and BBZ-AROCH2 induced 74 and 40% apoptotic
cells, respectively. Similarly, ALI-C3 and BMSG-SH-3 exhibited 35 and 36% Annexin V–FITC
positive cells, whereas the control cells did not show any significant
evidence of apoptotic cell populations (Figure 5B,C).

Discussion
The present study is the first report of
the incorporation of bisbenzimidazoles
on NDI moieties as G-quadruplex binders and stabilizers. Here, we
have synthesized three molecules with different side-chain lengths
to monitor their effect on binding with G-quadruplex DNA as well as
duplex DNA (Scheme 1). The rationale for the design of such agents is as follows: (1)
benzimidazole, being the isostere of natural purine, will have enhanced
interactions with the biopolymer;41,42 (2) the introduction
of aromaticity will provide an increased end-stacking; (3) the positive
charge on piperazine increases interactions with the negatively charged
phosphate backbone of DNA; and (4) the substitution on two sides of
the NDI ring will provide these molecules with a crescent shape, which
will contribute to binding with the DNA. The current study was focused
on understanding the effect of the two side-chain modifications by
increasing the aromaticity and the surface area on stacking with the
G-quartet. Our study supports the fact that bisbenzimidazole, which
was earlier reported as a DNA minor groove binder, can also bind to
G-quadruplexes irrespective of their conformations. Here, we analyzed
the FRET melting profile of all ligands, which clearly indicates that
these ligands have a preference for quadruplex DNA binding as compared
to duplex DNA binding. The ligand-induced stabilization of the quadruplex
in the presence of competitor DNA strands suggests that ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3 induce the
formation of the G-quadruplex and are selective toward the quadruplex
structure over that of duplex DNA. However, when we compare all of
the ligands, BBZ-ARO appears to be the most potent in
terms of the increment of FRET melting in the presence or absence
of the complementary DNA sequence. Therefore, the presence of ligands
causes a shift in the equilibria toward the formation of quadruplex
DNA and not duplex DNA. In addition, we evaluated the effect of all
three synthesized ligands on quadruplex stability by studying the
thermal melting profiles. Thermal melting was found to be independent
of quadruplex concentration, both with and without ligands, indicating
the formation of an intramolecular structure (in the case of h-telo 22-mer quadruplex). Among all of the ligands, BBZ-ARO was observed to show the highest binding affinity
and Gibb’s binding free energy (ΔG°)
when titrated with 12-mer. The reaction was found to be exothermic
with a positive entropy and a negative enthalpy. The strong enthalpy
contributions make the binding free energy (ΔG°) favorable. The hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions
between BBZ-ARO and BBZ-AROCH2 with the quadruplex are assumed to contribute to the
favorable enthalpy. The large entropic contribution in the case of BBZ-ARO suggests a completely different mode of binding from
that of the others. ALI-C3 and BMSG-SH-3, however, showed better enthalpic contributions
and negligible entropies, with one and greater than one stoichiometry,
respectively. It has been observed in the literature that only intramolecular
quadruplexes give accurate results in SPR, as intermolecular quadruplexes
undergo a fast regeneration step. Hence, we did not do SPR experiments
with 12-mer, which is an intermolecular quadruplex.

The extra
phenyl ring in BBZ-ARO, purposely placed
for the increment of aromaticity as well as for better stacking interactions
proved to be the most potent from different experimental data as compared
to that of the other counterparts, that is, BBZ-AROCH2 and ALI-C3. The results from the different experiments suggest that BBZ-ARO binds the most strongly, and stabilizes quadruplex
DNA, of the three ligands synthesized. G-quadruplex binding selectivity
determined as a fraction of two equilibrium-binding constants (KG4DNA/KdsDNA) was
determined by SPR. We also calculated ΔG°
obtained from K (K = kon/koff) of the binding from
dG = −RT ln K and compared the values to the free energy values obtained
by ITC, and further validated by MD/docking. The MM-PBSA calculations
are comparable with the determined thermodynamic parameters and suggest
more effective binding of BBZ-ARO with quadruplexes as
compared to that of ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2. We also suggest that the
MM-based free energy computations based on MD simulations are more
sensitive for correlating the data obtained from experiments. Thus,
the thermodynamic parameters obtained from MD, as well as from docking,
can be taken in consideration to conclude that BBZ-ARO most effectively binds to both quadruplexes of all of the ligands,
in terms of ΔG°. Equilibrium constants
obtained from ITC and SPR are not comparable directly as the two techniques
follow entirely different principles, but the trends of the results
are noticeably comparable. The data obtained showed a similar binding
trend with all four ligands and quadruplexes. BBZ-ARO displayed the highest inhibition of telomerase activity with considerable
ligand-induced toxicity to cancerous cells. The cell cycle experiments
showed that BBZ-ARO causes G2/M arrest and induces apoptosis
in cells. Thus, suggesting BBZ-ARO can be further developed
as an anticancer agent.

Conclusions
The introduction of
benzimidazole, along with a phenyl side chain,
into the scaffold of NDI improved the stability of G-quadruplexes.
Replacement of the phenyl ring with a “CH2”
group in BBZ-AROCH2 drastically
lowered the stability as compared to that of its aromatic counterpart.
Out of the three, BBZ-ARO showed the higher preference
(>158 times) for the G-quadruplex structure as compared to that
of
dsDNA. This indicates the association of BBZ-ARO with
G4-DNA is an entropically driven phenomenon with an intrinsic
association constant of the order of 106 M–1. ΔEvdW contributed a major part
in the stacking of the ligands with the quadruplexes, which was the
main reason that BBZ-ARO showed the most effective binding
with both quadruplexes of the three ligands. The MM-PBSA calculations
clearly indicate better effective packing of BBZ-ARO with
the quadruplexes than that of both ALI-C3 and BBZ-AROCH2. Further, BBZ-ARO inhibited telomerase enzyme activity at five times
lower concentration as compared to that of the reported BMSG-SH-3. BBZ-ARO showed less cytotoxicity to near normal cells
as compared to cancer cells increasing its therapeutic index. Ligands
used in this study help to discriminate G-quadruplex from dsDNA, and
further, those ligands have the unique ability to recognize topologically
different G-quadruplexes, which can be exploited in their development
as anticancer agents.

Compound purity was determined through analytical
HPLC using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 controlled using a YMC ODS-AQ analytical
column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) and a Dionex ultimate 3000 photo diode
array detector around 340 nm wavelength. Acetonitrile/water with 0.1%
formic acid was used as the solvent system with a gradient mode at
1 mL/min flow rate for HPLC analysis (the detailed procedure is described
in Supporting Information). Compounds were
found to be more than 95% pure on HPLC analysis.

Sample Preparation
Throughout the study, we used three
oligomeric HPLC purified DNA sequences; human telomeric 22-mer sequence
(h-telo 22-mer quadruplex) 5′-AGGGTTAGGG-TTAGGGTTAGGG-3′,
12-mer inter-strand forming quadruplex sequence (h-telo 12-mer) 5′-TAGGGTTAGGGT-3′, and self-complementary duplex
sequence (26-mer duplex DNA) 5′-CAATCGGATCGAATTCGATCCGATTG-3′
as the positive control, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore.
The molar absorption coefficient values used for the 22-mer and 12-mer
oligonucleotide sequences d(AGGGTTAGGG-TTAGGGTTAGGG) were obtained
from equally concentrated solutions of the monomers in buffer solution
(10 mM sodium cacodylate, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 25 mM KCl, pH 7.0), heated
to 95 °C for 10 min and then cooled gradually to 4 °C. Ligand
stock solutions were made with a working buffer solution and their
concentration was determined spectroscopically in cuvettes of 1 cm
path length using the molar absorption coefficients (M–1 cm–1): 285 000 at 362 nm for ALI-C3; 256 270 at 350 nm for BBZ-ARO; 238 000 at 360 nm for BBZ-AROCH2; 244 950 at 369 nm for BMSG-SH-3. Freshly
prepared working stock solutions were used beforehand. We used the
same (above mentioned) buffer throughout all our experiments except
the SPR study.

FRET Experiments of G-Quadruplexes with Ligands
in the Presence
of Duplex DNA
HPLC purified dual-labeled G-rich oligonucleotides
(5′-fluorescein and 3′-TAMRA) and their respective unlabeled
complementary strands were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India, for
fluorescence melting experiments. 5′-Fluorescein-TAGGGTTAGGGT-3′-TAMRA
(F12T) and 5′-fluorescein-AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3′-TAMRA
(F22T) were used for fluorescence experiments conducted in a Cary
Eclipse Spectrofluorimeter at constant temperature with the help of
peltier. Both oligos were prepared by incubating F22T and F12T quadruplex
forming strands (0.25 μM) with their respective 10 times high
concentration of complementary unlabeled single strand (2 μM)
for 24 h at 25 °C. The different melting experiments were performed
with or without 2 μM concentrations of each ligand (ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, and BBZ-AROCH2) in buffer solutions with both quadruplex
samples mentioned above. The fluorescein signal at 520 nm was analyzed
as described earlier.43−47 Fluorescence emission at 520 nm was recorded with excitation at
480 nm at 1 °C intervals from 25–95 °C and 60 s was
set for sample optimization prior to each reading to ensure stabilization.
G-quadruplex melting was monitored with or without varying concentrations
of the ligands and/or of the single stranded competitor Compl 22 (5′-CCCTAACC
CTAACCCTAACCCT-3′) and Compl 12 (5′-ACCCTAACCCTA-3′).
Data analysis was performed in Origin 7.5.

ITC of Ligands with G-Quadruplexes
ITC experiments48 were done on a Microcal
VP-ITC unit (MicroCal,
Inc., Northampton, MA). The energetics of the binding of the synthesized
ligands ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3 with h-telo 22-mer intra-strand quadruplex and h-telo 12-mer inter-strand quadruplex, along with the control
duplex DNA, were carried out in the same buffer at pH 7.0 at 25 °C.
Microcal’s Thermovac unit was used to degas all solutions under
vacuum (160 mbar, 10 min) prior to use. Approximate aliquots of 5–10
μL of the ligands (4 × 10–4 M) were injected
from a rotating (381 rpm) micro syringe into the 1.4235 mL calorimeter
cell containing the DNA quadruplex and duplex solution (1.0 ×
10–5 M) to achieve a binding isotherm completely.
The duration was taken as 20 s; 240 s was fixed as the delay time
between each injection, and the initial delay was kept as 60 s before
the first injection throughout the experiments. A heat burst curve
(microcalories against time) was obtained with the area under the
peak determined from integration of the measured heat associated with
each injection (Origin 7.0 software). Thermograms derived from the
difference of experimental heat from the corresponding heat associated
with the ligand–DNA injection were studied by the single binding
site model of the Levenberg–Marquardt nonlinear least squares
curve fitting algorithm.

A similar ligand concentration in the
buffer at the same volume was used to perform control experiment to
generate the heat of ligand dilution. Similarly, experimental heat
of ligand dilution was subtracted from the reaction generated heat
and this corrected injection heat was plotted as a function of molar
ratio. Micro Cal Origin software was used to fit titration curves
with the assumption of a single binding site. Free energy change (ΔG°) and entropy (ΔS°) were
calculated from the relationship ΔG° =
−RT ln Ka = ΔH° – TΔS°. The reported Ka and ΔH° values are mean ±
standard deviation (SD) from three experiments.

SPR Studies
of Ligands with G-Quadruplexes
SPR measurements
were performed on Streptavidin-coated sensor chips (Sensor chip SA,
BIAcore Inc.)48 in BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore
Inc.). All 5′-biotinylated sequences containing T9 linker (Btn-TTTTTTTTT-5′-AGGGTT-AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3′
and Btn-TTTTTTTTT-5′-CAATCGGAT-CGAATTC-GATCCGATTG-3′)
were heated to 95 °C and allowed to anneal to form a quadruplex
by gradual cooling in 10 mM HEPES buffer containing 100 mM KCl with
0.005% surfactant IGEPAL (pH 7.4). The immobilized oligonucleotide
surface was equilibrated with running buffer for 2 h at 20 μL/min
flow rate at 25 °C. Different analyte concentration solutions
(1.0 × 10–9 to 10–6 M) in
running buffer were injected for 300 s at the same flow rate randomly
to overcome systematic error. 1 M NaCl in 50 mM NaOH was used for
regeneration. Binding sensorgrams by a two independent binding site
model were analyzed by BIA evaluation software 3.1. All experiments
were conducted in triplicate and values are mean ± standard error
(SEM).

Molecular Docking Protocol
The initial structures for
intra-strand G-quadruplex DNA (PDB accession code: 143D)49 and inter-strand G-quadruplex DNA (PDB accession code: 1K8P)50 were taken from the protein data bank. All four ligands, ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, BBZ-AROCH2, and BMSG-SH-3, were docked in 22-mer and 12-mer G-quadruplexes using Glide v 5.7.
Ligands were prepared by the Ligprep module and quadruplexes were
minimized using an Amber force field implemented in Schrodinger suits.
A grid with dimensions of 50.10 × 48.63 × 40.56 Å3 over the G-quadruplex was used. The defined grid covers the
entire topology of the G-quadruplex so that the ligand position and
orientation relative to the receptor can be sampled sufficiently;
the conformation of the receptor was also fixed during the docking.
The standard precision mode of the software was used for the initial
screening of the molecules. Selected top scoring molecules binding
to the desired core of the G-quadruplex were selected for the extra
precision mode of docking. Glide uses rigid docking protocol; therefore,
to account for the conformational dynamics during docking, we used
AutoDock4 in addition to Glide. We used standard protocol for receptor
grid generation and ligand docking in Auto docks tools.51The best docking pose, ranked according to docking
scores, was selected for further MD simulations study.52−54

MD Simulations
We used Amber 1455 for all MD simulations and free energy calculations. As
the parameters for the ligands were not present in the Amber library,
therefore parameters for all ligands were prepared by the antechamber
module. HF/6-31 G* level of theory was taken for ab initio calculation
from Gaussian 03 and calculation of partial charges were done by the
restraint electrostatic potential method. The whole system was neutralized
with K+ ions and taken into a rectangular box of TIP3P
water extending over 10.0 Å from the quadruplex exterior. Ptraj
module of Amber14 was used for post MD analysis. VMD 1.6.7 was used
to perform analysis of trajectories,56 whereas
trajectory visualization was done using Chimera-1.557 and Maestro58 graphical programs.
The analysis of free energy from the production trajectories using
the single trajectory MM-PBSA approach was used.59,60 The free energy difference of binding was measured with the following
equation  where ΔG and ΔH are the binding free energy and enthalpy
change at temperature T, respectively.

Determination
of Inhibition of Cellular Telomerase Activity
Using TRAP-Lig Assay
The TRAP-Lig assay was performed as
reported earlier from A549 cells.41,42 Briefly, 1 00 000
cells were collected and lysed in a 100 μL ice-cold NP-40 lysis
buffer. After 30 min incubation, the supernatant was collected for
the TRAP-Lig assay. 0.5 μL of this supernatant was treated with
increasing concentrations of ligands (1, 5, 10, 25, 50 μM).
Each reaction tube contained 50 μM final concentrations of the
dNTP mix, 1× TRAP buffer, 20 μg of final concentration
ultrapure bovine serum albumin (BSA), 200 ng of the TS primer (5′-Cy3-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT,
HPLC purified), and 1 μL of the primer mix recipe mentioned
below was further added for each sample.

The final 50 μL
reaction volume was achieved adding RNase-free water. Primer mix content:
10 μg of each ACX primer: 5′-GCGCGGCTTACCCTTACCCTT-ACCCTAACC-3′
and NT primer: 5′-ATCGCTTCTCGGCCTTTT-3′ and 1 μL
(TSNT oligonucleotide: 5′-AATC-CGTCGAGCAGAGTTAAAAGGCCGAGAAGCGAT-3′
diluted to final concentration up to 1.0 × 10–18 mol μL–1) was mixed and the volume made
up to 100 μL by adding RNase-free water. After 30 min incubation
at 37 °C, telomerase extension products were column purified
(QIA quick nucleotide purification kit, Qiagen). Purified telomerase
extended samples were mixed with equal volumes of the master mix containing
1 μL of the primer mix, 200 ng of the TS primer, TRAP buffer,
20 μg of BSA final concentration, 50 μM dNTPs (final concentration)
and equal Taq polymerase. Samples were amplified as per reported polymerase
chain reaction conditions. Subsequent amplification yielded a 6-bp
incremental ladder, which was further analyzed by 10% w/v nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE. The gel was then
fixed in 50% ethanol for 30 min and scanned under Cy3 (green) fluorescence
with a phosphorimager.

In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay
Human cervical (HeLa),
lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A-549), and human embryonic kidney
(HEK 293T) cells were obtained from the National Center for Cell Science,
Pune, India. After 48 and 72 h incubation with ALI-C3, BBZ-ARO, and BBZ-AROCH2 at 37 °C, the ligand containing medium
was replaced with 200 μL of fresh medium with equal MTT reagent
and incubated for 4 h. The formazon product was dissolved in equal
volumes of DMSO and the samples were read at 570 nm using a microplate
reader (Infinite M 200, Tecan, Singapore).

Annexin V-FITC/PI Staining
Ligand mediated apoptosis
in HeLa cells was studied by Annexin V-FITC/PI Staining following
the manufacturer’s guidelines (V13242, Invitrogen, Life technology,
India). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells per 60 mm plate were
treated with indicated ligands at 1 μM concentration. Cells
were collected after 24 h, washed through PBS twice and resuspended
in the provided buffer at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Equal volumes of Annexin V-FITC were added to all
samples, mixed well, and further incubated for 15 min in the dark
at room temperature. The final volume was achieved with a binding
buffer and samples were analyzed on LSR II (Becton Dickinson).

Cell
Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
Cell cycle analysis
by flow cytometry was carried out as described in the literature61 with minor modifications. Briefly, subconfluent
HeLa cells were treated with indicated ligands at 1 μM concentration
for 24 h. Cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in
chilled 70% ethanol. Subsequently, cells were treated with RNAse (0.5
mg/mL) and then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/mL). Acquisition
was done on a FACS BD LSR Fortessa and analyzed using BD FACS Diva
software.
