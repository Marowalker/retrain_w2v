The vertical configuration is a powerful tool recently developed experimentally to investigate field
effects in quasi two-dimensional systems. Prototype graphene-based
vertical tunneling transistors can achieve an extraordinary control
over current density utilizing gate voltages. In this work, we study
theoretically vertical tunneling junctions that consist of a monolayer
of photoswitchable aryl azobenzene molecules sandwiched between two
sheets of graphene. Azobenzene molecules transform between trans and
cis conformations upon photoexcitation, thus adding a second knob
that enhances the control over physical properties of the junction.
Using first-principles methods within the density functional framework,
we perform simulations with the inclusion of field effects for both
trans and cis configurations. We find that the interference of interface
states resulting from molecule–graphene interactions at the
Fermi energy introduces a dual-peak pattern in the transmission functions
and dominates the transport properties of gate junctions, shedding
new light on interfacial processes.

Introduction
In miniaturizing metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors
to sub-5 nm size, one encounters severe challenges in preserving system
performance and reliability,1 and one must
rely on new physics emerging from nanoscale material systems to overcome
this obstacle. The vertical integration of tunneling field-effect
transistors (TFETs) based on the stacking of two-dimensional (2D)
layered materials has been explored as an alternative transistor architecture
in recent years.2−6 Vertical TFET stacking layers of graphene with 2D insulators and
semiconductors, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and transition
metal dichalcogenides, have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary
control of the tunneling current via gate voltages.4,5,7 Equally, if not more, important, the vertical
configuration introduces a technique to approach fundamental physics
processes at interfaces, an emergent area in materials, chemical,
and condensed matter physics.8−11

When the thickness of a system is of nanoscale,
interfacial physics
governs the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties. For instance,
the h-BN | graphene interface is electrostatically sharp,7 whereas the dielectric response of WS2 is greatly affected by interface with graphene.12 Interface physics is in general not limited to nanoscale
materials; interfaces between two bulk systems or between a bulk material
and vacuum or air can also trigger emergent phenomena. Examples include
the two-dimensional electron gas at a LaAlO3 | SrTiO3 interface13 and the protected
surface states of the celebrated topological insulators.14 Nanostructured 2D systems, which have bulk 2D
extent but are finite in the third dimension, provide unique opportunities
for investigating and understanding interfacial processes.

The
subject of this study is TFETs based on graphene and organic
materials. Recent advances in fabricating hybrid nanoscale heterostructures
have made it possible to incorporate organic molecules in the design
of vertical TFETs. Covalent bonds between molecules and graphene can
form via dediazoniation.15,16 It was proposed that
such bonds enhance the flexibility of graphene | molecule | graphene
junctions.17 The gate-voltage-tunable transport
through graphene | molecule interfaces has been attributed to modulation
of the Schottky barriers at the interface.18−20 Organic molecules
offer the advantage over inorganic materials that their properties
can be modified by substituting various ligands; in particular, photoswitchability
can be incorporated by inserting azobenzene ligands17,21−24 that can switch between trans and cis conformations.

The trans
conformation has an energy of about 0.6 eV lower than
that of cis.25 An energy barrier of approximately
1.6 eV needs to be overcome during a trans-to-cis transition.26 In experiments, a trans-to-cis isomerization
occurs upon photoexcitation by light with a wavelength of 365 nm and
a cis-to-trans isomerization at 420 nm.17,27

The
electronic, magnetic, and photoelectronic properties of molecules
on graphene have been studied previously.28−30 In this work,
we investigate theoretically the interface states at graphene | azobenzene(containing)
| graphene nanojunctions and the emerging phenomena when the gate
voltage is turned on. Combined with the optical control over the trans
and cis forms of azobenzene molecules, we propose a multicontrol charge
transport process and the underlying physical origin.

Computational
Methods
Calculations were carried out using density functional
theory (DFT).
The geometries of graphene | trans | graphene (Gr | trans | Gr) and
graphene | cis | graphene (Gr | cis | Gr), as shown in Figure 1a,b, were fully optimized using
the VASP package.31,32 The nuclei and frozen core electrons
were modeled with the projector augmented-wave method.33,34 The weak interactions between molecules and the top graphene layer
were treated using the van der Waals density functional.35,36 Integrals over the first Brillouin zone were carried out on a regular
mesh of 55 × 55 × 1 k-points, and the plane-wave
cutoff for wave function expansion was set to 500 eV. The residual
force on every atom is smaller than 0.01 eV/Å after relaxation.

Figure 1 Schematics
of graphene | molecule | graphene tunneling field-effect
transistors (TFETs). A gate voltage, Vg, is applied to the gate electrode below. The molecule can be in
(a) trans and (b) cis conformations.

We studied transport properties using the DFT-based nonequilibrium
Green’s function method,37 which
is widely used for molecular junctions. Within the generalized gradient
approximation parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof,38 the electronic structure and transport properties
were calculated using the SIESTA package,39 based on Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials40 and a pseudoatomic orbital basis set. The electrostatic
interaction was treated by the effective screening medium (ESM) approach41 that solves the Hartree potential with nonperiodic
boundary conditions, and we recently adopted the ESM method to simulate
gate effects.7,42 Additional electrons (holes)
were added to the Gr | molecule | Gr system to simulate the positive
(negative) gate voltage. An areal electron density of 6.24 ×
1012 cm–2 corresponds to a gate electric
displacement field of ϵ0Eg = 0.01 C/m2. Compared with the gate voltage and gate
electric field (Eg), the electric displacement
field, ϵ0Eg, is a more
convenient quantity because it is independent of the thickness or
the dielectric constant of the dielectric material separating the
Gr | molecule | Gr system and the gate electrode.

The molecule–graphene
heterogeneous TFET is schematically
shown in Figure 1.
Azobenzene-containing molecules 4-(10-(4-((4-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)diazenyl)phenoxy)ethenyloxy)benzene
are anchored at the bottom graphene layer by a C–C bond, and
the contact with the top graphene layer is of van der Waals nature.
The leftmost and rightmost graphene regions serve as source and drain,
respectively.

The curved part of the left graphene sheet follows
the description
in ref (43) where it
was shown that electrons encounter little scattering. This configuration
mimics the experimental configuration, and gate voltages are guaranteed
to induce the same potential shift on source and drain. Equilibrium
Green’s function and transmission probability were calculated
from the Hamiltonian using a well-established procedure.37

Results
Transmission of Gr | molecule
| Gr junctions depends on the conformation
(trans and cis) of the molecule and can be modulated by the gate voltage,
as shown in Figure 2. The Gr | trans | Gr junction has a transmission almost symmetric
with respect to the negative and positive gate voltages, whereas transmission
of the Gr | cis | Gr junction is much enhanced by positive gate voltages.
With no gate voltage, the different conductance of azobenzene-containing molecules
with trans and cis conformations was attributed to the difference
in their lengths,17 different couplings
to electrodes,44 and different tunneling
pathways.45 The astonishing gate effect,
as seen in Figure 2, on the transmission reveals new physics that requires explanation.

Figure 2 Transmission
at the Fermi energy as a function of gate voltage
for Gr | trans | Gr and Gr | cis | Gr junctions.

Electronic transport through molecules is usually governed
by molecular
orbitals, especially the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), those closest
to the Fermi energy. Transmission by a molecular orbital exhibits
a Lorentzian peak centered at approximately its energy and with width
proportional to the strength of its coupling to electrodes.46,47 Both Gr | trans | Gr and Gr | cis | Gr junctions show two peaks
in their transmission curves at zero gate voltage (Figure 3). Peaks at around −0.7
eV correspond to the HOMO and those near 1.0 eV are attributed to the LUMO. The peak corresponding
to the HOMO in trans junctions is narrow and weak (the peak becomes
more clear in a linear scale plotting), which indicates a weaker coupling
between this orbital and graphene electrodes. The dips in the transmission
curves near the Fermi energy are the results of the small density
of states in graphene electrodes. We also examined the evolution of
the transmission curves of Gr | trans | Gr and Gr | cis | Gr junctions
under different gate voltages (Figure 4) as a function of energy. Note that the energy range
in here is smaller than that in Figure 3 and transmission peaks due to LUMO and HOMO do not
appear in this energy window.

Gr | trans | Gr
and (bottom) Gr | cis | Gr junctions under zero gate voltage.

Figure 4 Transmission curves under different gate voltages
of Gr | trans
| Gr and Gr | cis | Gr junctions. The position of the Dirac point
of the graphene lead is denoted by arrows.

The Dirac point of graphene electrodes shifts along with
the gate
voltage (arrows in Figure 4). Peaks in transmission close to the Fermi energy are responsible
for the Gr | trans | Gr junction, showing a higher transmission than that of the Gr | cis |
Gr junction at a positive gate voltage (Figure 2). Near the Fermi energy, these emergent
peaks cannot be explained by molecular orbitals, which are far away
from the Fermi energy.

Do these peaks correspond to states emerging
from molecule–graphene
or molecule–molecule interactions at the interface? We looked
into the electronic structure to identify the states responsible for
the transmission peaks near the Fermi energy. With this question in
mind, we built periodic structures of Gr | trans | Gr and Gr | cis
| Gr whose unit cells are shown in the inset of Figure 1. Each unit cell contains one molecule and
3 × 3 primitive cells of top and bottom graphene, corresponding
to the density of molecules observed in experiments.17 Band structures of Gr | trans | Gr and Gr | cis | Gr are
shown in Figure 5a2,b2.
The strongly dispersive bands spanning the whole energy range come
from graphene layers. The bands contributed by the top graphene layer
(bonded to the molecule via van der Waals interaction) are highlighted
in blue to distinguish them from those of the bottom graphene layer.
The Dirac point of both graphene layers is 0.15 eV above the Fermi
energy, and both of them are hole-doped due to charge transfer with
molecules. The molecular orbitals show up as nearly flat bands due
to the large distances (∼7 Å) among molecules. The LUMO
corresponds to the dispersionless band at 1 eV above the Fermi energy,
whereas the HOMO falls at around −0.7 eV. The HOMO–LUMO
energy gap is 1.74 eV for trans and 1.90 eV for cis molecules. The
HOMO and LUMO in both trans and cis molecules are localized on the
azobenzene ligand (Figure 6). For trans molecules, the HOMO is strongly localized between
the two benzene rings, whereas the LUMO spreads over the whole azobenzene
ligand (Figure 6a1,a3).
The HOMO and LUMO of cis molecules have very similar spatial distributions
(Figure 6b1,b3).

of (a1)–(a3) Gr | trans | Gr and (b1)–(b3)
Gr | cis | Gr junctions for gate voltages of (a1, b1) ϵ0Eg = −13.6 × 10–3 C/m2, (a2, b2) ϵ0Eg = 0, and (a3, b3) ϵ0Eg = 13.6 × 10–3 C/m2. The bands contributed by the top graphene layer are highlighted
in blue. The Fermi energy is denoted by the dashed line at 0 eV. The
energy shift of the HOMO state and the Dirac point (ED) of the top graphene layer by gate voltages is plotted
in (c).

Figure 6 Charge density corresponding to the (a1, b1)
HOMO, (a2, b2) C–C
interface state, and (a3, b3) LUMO states of (a) trans and (b) cis
junctions. Charge density integrated over the x–y plane (parallel to the graphene sheet) along the z direction (normal to the graphene sheet) for HOMO (blue
solid lines), LUMO (black dotted lines), and C–C interface
states (red dashed lines) of (c) trans and (d) cis junctions.

The state near the Fermi energy
can be identified from the band
structure. The weakly dispersive bands crossing the Fermi energy (Figure 5a2,b2) can be traced
to the C–C bond between the molecule and the bottom graphene
layer. The charge density corresponding to this state mainly resides
on the bottom graphene layer and the phenyl ligand chemically bonded
to it; thus, it is an interface state (Figure 6a2,b2). The energy of the interface state
is very close to the Dirac point of the bottom graphene layer; this
fact is independent of the size of the supercell. We did test calculations
using bigger supercells containing one molecule and more than 3 ×
3 graphene primitive cells. Results show that the interface state
always appears near the Dirac point of the bottom graphene. This indicates
that the energy of the interface state is determined by a local interaction
between a molecule and the bottom graphene and not caused by artifacts
due to periodic boundary conditions. The x–y plane integrated charge densities corresponding to the
HOMO, LUMO, and the interface state are plotted along the z direction in Figure 6c,d. The charge density of the interface state decays
exponentially across the whole molecule because its energy is within
the LUMO–HOMO gap of the molecule and the decay rate is faster
than that of both LUMO and HOMO states. The surface state is well-coupled
to the bottom graphene, whereas its coupling with the top graphene
is quite weak. Electronic transport via the interface state can be
well-described using the nonequilibrium Green’s function method
mentioned above.

Gate voltages shift the bands of Gr | molecule
| Gr junctions.
Band structures at gate voltages of ϵ0Eg = −13.6, 0.0, and 13.6 × 10–3 C/m2 are shown in Figure 5a,b. The LUMO and HOMO states shift toward lower energy
as the gate voltage changes from negative to positive, although the
HOMO–LUMO energy gap remains unchanged. The energy shift of
bands from the top graphene layer is visible by tracing the position
of the Dirac point. These energy shifts are summarized in Figure 5c, where the LUMO
state is not plotted because its distance from the HOMO state is unchanged.
The effect of gate voltage on the top graphene layer is screened mainly
by the bottom graphene layer. The position of the Dirac point of the
top graphene layer in the Gr | trans | Gr junction shows the same
dependence on gate voltage as in the Gr | cis | Gr junction (Figure 5c). The energy shift
of the HOMO in Gr | trans | Gr is weaker than that in the cis junction,
which can be explained by the spatial positions of the molecular orbitals.
Whereas the HOMO and LUMO states of trans molecules are near the center
of the junction, the molecular states of cis molecules are located
away from the bottom graphene layer, so gate voltages have a weaker
influence on the orbitals of cis molecules. The band due to the C–C
interface state is insensitive to the gate voltage because it contributes
a large density of states around the Fermi energy. The bands from
the bottom graphene layer are pinned by the C–C interface state,
so they are also unchanged by gate voltages.

Discussion
We
first discuss the connection between the electronic structure
and transport properties. Energy shifts of molecular orbitals in response
to gate voltages are reflected in the transmission curve. A negative
gate voltage raises the HOMO closer to the Fermi energy (Figure 5). The enhancement
of transmission of Gr | cis | Gr junctions at negative energies is
due to the tail of the Breit–Wigner resonance through the HOMO
(Figure 4). (The Breit–Wigner
resonance was first derived in the context of nuclear physics.48 A modern introduction of the Breit–Wigner
resonance in electronic transport can be found in refs (49, 50).) This phenomenon is not observed in trans
junctions because of the strongly localized HOMO. Positive gate voltages
lower the LUMO closer to the Fermi energy, which results in a similar
enhancement of transmission at positive energies. This enhancement
happens only in the cis junction, in which gate voltages more efficiently
tune the energies of molecular orbitals (Figure 5c).

Low-energy peaks in the transmission
curve are closely related
to the interface state. Positions of transmission peaks are not affected
by gate voltages (Figure 4) because the energy of the interface state is insensitive
to the gate voltage. The heights of transmission peaks are tunable
by gate voltages. At zero gate voltage, the contribution of the interface
state is canceled by the low density of states of the graphene leads,
which results in the absence of transmission peaks (see the middle
panel with ϵ0Eg = 0 of Figure 4). The gate voltage
brings the interface state into play by shifting the Dirac point of
the top graphene layer away from the Fermi energy, and transmission
peaks emerge as a result. However, the complexity of the resulting
voltage dependence of the transmission curve goes far beyond a simple
shift. The interface state contributes peaks in the transmission curve
around the Fermi energy and dominates the transmission at positive
gate voltages (Figure 4).

Next, we discuss the mechanism behind the dual peak in the
transmission
curve around the Fermi energy at a positive gate voltage (top panel, Figure 4). At first glance,
the asymmetric dual peak is reminiscent of the Fano resonance,51−53 but it was excluded after detailed analysis. The Fano resonance
mechanism involves two conducting channels separated in energy: a
first (background) channel has an energy far away from the Fano region
and a second (local) channel near the Fano region. Interference between
the two channels results in an asymmetric transmission peak, and destructive
interference can lead to a valley between two peaks. To apply Fano’s
model to Gr | molecule | Gr junctions, the interface state around
the Fermi energy can be seen as the local channel. For the trans junction,
the molecular LUMO can serve as the background channel, which contributes
transmission at positive energies. This explanation however fails
for the cis junction, which shows no signature of LUMO contribution
to the transmission at positive energies. A novel interpretation is
needed. We note that the interface state in Figures 6a2,b2 forms a band with a 0.2 eV width (Figures 5a,b) that is of
the same order of magnitude as that of the width of the asymmetric
peaks in the transmission. We hypothesize that the asymmetric transmission
peak arises from interference of interface states. If true, the width
and shape of the transmission peak can be changed by tuning the dispersion
and width of the band corresponding to the interface state. We carried
out supplementary calculations using the same configuration in Figure 1 but with the density
of molecules reduced by half; the band dispersion of the interface
state is thus also reduced. Calculations show that the width of the
transmission peak is reduced and, more importantly, the dual-peak
feature disappears (Figure 7). This supports our hypothesis that the asymmetric transmission
peak is contributed by the interface state. This result can also be
viewed as an evidence against the Fano mechanism because none of the
global or local channels are killed by reducing the molecular density.

Figure 7 Transmission
of the Gr | cis | Gr junction and a junction with
the density of cis molecules reduced by half. The gate voltage is
ϵ0Eg = 12.9 × 10–3 C/m2.

Conclusions
We studied a vertical field-effect system consisting
of graphene
and photoswitchable aryl azobenzene molecules. Light irradiation can
transform the molecule between trans and cis conformations. Calculations
demonstrate the simultaneous control of the electronic structure and
transport properties by light irradiation and gate voltages. A gate
voltage shifts the positions of the LUMO and HOMO of molecules and
the bands from graphene. The C–C chemical bonding between molecules
and the bottom graphene layer results in an interface state at the
Fermi energy. This interface state interactions with other C–C
bonding states can lead under a finite gate voltage to a strong peak
at the Fermi level and therefore dominate the transport properties
of junctions. The distinct feature of this junction, as shown in the
calculated transmission curves (Figure 4), illustrates the importance of interfacial processes
and predicts that emergent patterns in transmission functions can
be engineered.
