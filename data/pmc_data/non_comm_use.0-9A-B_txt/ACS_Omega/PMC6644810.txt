Xanthine
is a nucleobase, deriving from adenine and guanine by
deamination and oxidation processes, which may deposit in the human
body causing diseases, similar to uric acid. Here, we have investigated
the adsorption of xanthine on silver colloidal nanoparticles by means
of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with an exciting radiation
in the near-infrared spectral region, where interference due to fluorescence
does not occur, along with density functional theory calculations
of molecule/metal model systems. By adopting a combined experimental
and computational approach, we have identified the “marker”
SERS bands of xanthine and the tautomer that preferentially binds
the silver particles, as well as the molecular group involved in the
interaction with metal. This investigation allows using the FT-SERS
spectroscopy for biosensory and diagnostic purposes in body fluids,
detecting abnormal levels of xanthine, and preventing metabolic diseases.

Introduction
The ability to recognize
and quantitatively evaluate nucleotides,
nucleosides, and their bases assumes great relevance in biomedical
applications,1−3 mainly because it allows to easily monitor the degradation
processes of nucleic acids present in body fluids and tissues. In
fact, concentration changes of these components may pinpoint alterations
in the physiological activity and presence of disease states. Xanthine
is a purine base that is not commonly present in RNA or DNA chains
yet derives from adenine and guanine by deamination and oxidation
processes, as illustrated in Figure 1. Also, xanthine undergoes oxidation to uric acid,
as shown in Figure 1, by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme.

Figure 1 Formation of xanthine
and uric acid from adenine and guanine.

As a consequence, a level of xanthine in the human body higher
than normal increases the presence of uric acid, forming kidney stones
with serious problems to the entire urinary tract. Moreover, xanthine,
similar to uric acid, may deposit in the human body and cause diseases
due to its scarce solubility in water.4,5 Hence, it is
important to have a reliable and sensitive technique for the identification
of xanthine in the human organism and prevent health-threatening conditions.
In particular, the recent developments in high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) allow the simultaneous determination of purine
metabolites as xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid in the human
plasma and serum.8 However, the possibility
of evidencing the presence of xanthine in biological liquids through
the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy9,10 represents a valid alternative to the HPLC technique. SERS allows
obtaining a trace detection of different molecules when the latter
are adsorbed on nanostructured surfaces of noble metals as silver
or gold. Actually, unlike the normal Raman scattering that has scarce
sensitivity due to its small cross section, SERS ensures huge enhancements
of the spectral signal of the adsorbed molecules, with factors generally
up to 106–107 with respect to the Raman
response due to nonadsorbed ones but up to 1014–1015 factors in single-molecule experiments.11,12 However, the validity of this spectroscopic technique is not only
and not so much due to the sensitivity of the technique but (1) in
the easy molecular recognition of the “markers” bands
of the molecule and (2) in the simplicity of the investigation procedures
that do not need any sample manipulation or separation procedure.

Here, we study the SERS response of xanthine adsorbed on silver
colloidal nanoparticles, in view of analytical applications in biomedicine.
For this purpose, we employed the FT-Raman instrumentation, with excitation
in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region. This excitation, despite
the low intensity of the Raman response in the NIR region (owing to
the λ–4 dependence of Raman scattering intensity),
is highly desirable for all of these applications requiring removal
of any interference of fluorescence from the Raman response. In fact,
fluorescence emission can be due to impurities that, even in traces,
add high levels of shot noise on the Raman bands, making their observation
a difficult task, as often occurring in biological samples.13 Moreover, the NIR region being coincident with
the so-called biological tissue transparency window,14 this could permit the use of the SERS spectroscopy to recognize
the presence of xanthine both in vitro and in vivo.

The interpretation
of the SERS data can be efficiently performed
by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on
model systems constituted of molecules bound to adatoms or adclusters
with a few metal atoms, which are able to simulate the active sites
present on the surface of the colloidal nanoparticles.15−18 This method allows not only to reproduce accurately the observed
SERS profiles, including band positions and relative intensities,
but also to understand the type and strength of the molecule/metal
interactions. Moreover, the DFT approach showed to be particularly
useful in identifying the molecular species that chemically interact
with metal.19−21 This information is essential to identify and quantify
the presence of xanthine in a mixture of different compounds, as expected
in body fluids, as well as to design analytical protocols to perform
such analysis.

Results
Structure and FT-Raman
Spectra of Xanthine
As xanthine
can exist as many possible tautomers,22 knowing the precise tautomers of this nucleobase is crucial to understand
the mechanisms of the enzymes of which it is a substrate. However,
the di-ketoforms, the N(9)H and N(7)H tautomers (see Figure 2), were considered by far the
most probable with respect to those with enolic structures, on the
basis of the energies estimated by AM1-PM3 study23 and DFT calculations;22,24,25 these latter, moreover, indicated the N(7)H tautomer
as more stable than the N(9)H tautomer. However, in acidic-neutral
water solutions, where xanthine is not deprotonated, both tautomers
are expected to be present.26

Figure 2 Di-keto tautomeric
forms of xanthine.

We have obtained FT-Raman
spectra of xanthine in aqueous solutions
at different pH values, as shown in Figure 3. It is important to show these spectra to
observe possible similarities with the SERS spectrum of xanthine,
which could suggest which molecular species is really adsorbed on
silver. Moreover, the Raman spectra of xanthine in solid phase (see Figure 3), where the presence
of the N(7)H tautomer is expected, can provide information on the
possible adsorption of this species on silver.

Figure 3 Normal Raman spectra
of xanthine as a solid sample and dissolved
in water solutions at different pH values, in comparison with the
corresponding SERS spectrum in Ag colloid. Concentrations: 10–1 M (water, pH 12), 10–3 M (water,
pH 6), and 10–6 M (Ag colloid). Excitation: 1064
nm.

Sizeable Raman differences occur
in aqueous solutions with respect
to the Raman spectrum of the solid sample and also in solution by
varying the pH values. At pH = 6 value, where xanthine, having pKa = 7.60, is predominantly present as neutral
molecule, the Raman spectrum is quite weak, because neutral xanthine
is scarcely soluble in water. At pH = 12, instead, the Raman spectrum
of the deprotonated xanthine is quite intense, because high concentrations
(around 10–1 M) can be obtained in water. However,
the strongest band occurs in all spectra around 650 cm–1; this band, for which position and intensity do not significantly
change by varying the physical state and the pH value in solution,
can be confidently attributed to the breathing mode of the ring system
of xanthine. The band observed at 1680 cm–1 in the
solid Raman spectrum is due to C=O stretching mode, with corresponding
bands occurring around 1695 cm–1 in the aqueous
solutions. The observed frequencies are reported in Table S1 of the Supporting Information; the solid Raman frequencies
observed in the present study are similar to those previously reported
in 2004 and 200527,28 but differ from some bands reported
in 2011,29 in both positions and relative
intensities. This evidence could be attributed to a lower purity degree
of the sample examined in 2011.

Adsorption of Xanthine
on Silver Colloidal Nanoparticles
The aim of this paper,
devoted to the SERS detection of xanthine,
is to use a metal colloidal suspension that exhibits these two characteristics:
colloidal stability and SERS efficiency. Therefore, we chose to use
a silver colloid obtained by reduction of silver ions with citrate,
according to the well-tested procedure by Lee and Meisel,30 because it exhibits a marked stability in both
absence and presence of organic ligand, thanks to the protection ensured
by adsorbed citrate anions. This is particularly important for the
identification and quantitative determination of xanthine, since colloidal
aggregation processes that evolve in time could significantly alter
the SERS response.

Several studies were performed to characterize
the silver colloids obtained by reduction with citrate according to
Lee and Meisel.30 It is important to point
out that boiling the colloidal suspension caused silver nanoparticles
to be monodispersed by the capping effect of the citrate anions, with
maximum absorption of the plasmonic band around 420 nm.30 The resulting pH value was around 6.5.31 In our case, the pH is slightly lower (pH ∼
6), because we waited a few weeks after the colloid preparation before
using the Ag suspension to obtain a better stabilization.

After
addition of xanthine (10–6 M concentration)
to the citrate-reduced Ag colloid, the maximum of the plasmon band
of the silver nanoparticles occurs at 425 nm wavelength, with a tail
in the red-light region (see Figure 4). In this situation, no FT-SERS signal can be detected
by laser excitation at 1064 nm, because the excitation wavelength
does not match the plasmon band. However, by adding NaCl (10–3 M concentration), the plasmon band markedly moves to the infrared
region, due to the aggregation of the silver particles promoted by
the presence of co-adsorbed chloride anions. In this case, strong
FT-SERS bands can be observed. The SERS activation of the silver colloids
by excitation in the NIR region was previously ascertained and discussed
by Kiefer and co-workers.32−34

a silver colloid with 10–6 M xanthine, before (A)
and after (B) addition of
10–3 M NaCl. The 1064 nm laser line of the FT-Raman
instrument is indicated.

FT-SERS Spectra of Xanthine in Silver Colloids
Figure 3 (upper panel) shows
the FT-SERS spectrum of xanthine adsorbed on Ag colloid, which appears
dominated by a very strong band at 657 cm–1, similar
to what observed in the normal Raman spectra of xanthine in solutions
and in solid phase. The SERS spectrum is quite different, in both
band frequencies and intensities, from the very weak FT-SERS spectrum
previously reported;35 the band positions,
instead, appear similar to those obtained by Cotton and co-workers
by visible excitation.36 At the pH value
of the Ag colloid (∼pH = 6), xanthine is expected to adsorb
on silver as a neutral molecule, which is predominantly present in
aqueous solution at this pH value. This, however, does not mean that
the molecule in silver colloidal suspension at this pH value cannot
bind to the metal as a deprotonated anion. In fact, when a molecule
chemically interacts with silver colloidal nanoparticles, deprotonation
reactions may occur by effect of the metal surface, although the deprotonated
species is absolutely negligible at the pH value of the aqueous solution.
In our case, however, the strong Raman bands of deprotonated xanthine
observed at 1273, 1352, and 1518 cm–1 in the Raman
spectrum of the alkaline solution (see Figure 3) do not find any correspondence in the SERS
spectrum. This leads to exclude an adsorption of xanthine in anionic
form. Moreover, the SERS spectrum appear quite different also from
the normal Raman spectrum of the solid sample (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information), where the molecule
is present as N(7)H tautomer, suggesting this latter is not involved
in the interaction with metal. Spectral differences, however, occur
in the SERS spectrum also with respect to the normal Raman spectrum
of the aqueous solution at pH = 6, where the coexistence of both tautomers
is expected. Besides marked frequency shifts observed in the 1200–1700
cm–1 spectral region, the highest-frequency band
occurs in the SERS spectrum beyond 1700 cm–1, unlike
in the normal Raman spectra. The FT-SERS spectrum of xanthine in Ag
colloid is similar to that of guanine adsorbed on silver,37 especially by considering the dominant band
around 650 cm–1 and the high-frequency band at about
1710 cm–1.

The spectral differences between
SERS and Raman spectra of xanthine are attributable to the interaction
with silver, which is to be interpreted as chemisorption, which significantly
modifies the force constants of the molecule as well as their relative
Raman intensities. For this reason, the DFT approach could provide
important information on the adsorption of xanthine, concerning the
preferential tautomer interacting with metal, the molecular site of
interaction with the active sites of the Ag nanoparticles, and also
the nature of the latter. We have adopted five different complexes
of both tautomers of xanthine linked to silver nanoparticles through
the nitrogen atoms with sp2 hybridization or the oxygen
atoms of the carbonyl groups. The metal active sites are simply modeled
as Ag+ adatoms, as previously carried out for adsorbed
adenine.16 The DFT-optimized structures
of these complexes are shown in Figure 5. The N(9)H tautomer can link the silver adatom via
N7 or O10, in the N(9)H-A or N(9)H-B complexes, respectively. In the
first case, also the O11 atom of the C=O group vicinal to N7
is involved in the binding with the metal surface. The tautomer N(7)H,
instead, can link the silver adatom via N9, O6, or O2, in the N(7)H-A,
N(7)H-B, or N(7)H-C complexes, respectively.

complexes.

DFT Simulations of the
SERS Spectrum of Xanthine in Silver Colloid
SERS enhancement
is generally considered9,10 as
the product of two contributions, one due to a long-range electromagnetic
mechanism and another due to a short-range chemical mechanism. Regarding
the first one, the molecules approaching a noble-metal nanoparticle
undergo an electric field several orders of magnitude (at least four)
larger than that at long distances from the surface, under the action
of the electromagnetic radiation. The second contribution to the SERS
enhancement, instead, depends on the change of the molecular polarizability
due to the formation of chemical bonds with the active sites of the
metal surface. Although the electromagnetic contribution plays a predominant
role for the overall SERS enhancement, the chemical one is important
to determine the SERS spectral pattern, concerning both spectral positions
and relative intensities of the observed bands. Hence, for chemisorbed
molecules, the profiles of the SERS spectra are essentially determined
by the chemical interactions between the molecules and the active
sites of the metal surface, called adatoms, constituted by one or
a few atoms, as stated by Otto38 and Aroca.39 The validity of the adatom approximation was
widely verified by DFT calculations of many adsorbed molecules; in
particular, the DFT-calculated Raman spectra of molecule/metal complexes
with a single silver atom are quite often able to reproduce satisfactorily
the corresponding SERS spectra, as shown also very recently.40−42 It is important to underline that the adatoms present on the surface
of the silver colloidal nanoparticles can be effectively considered
positively charged.14−16 In this regard, the adsorption of the negatively
charged citrate ions on the silver colloidal surface plays an important
role: the citrate anions not only perform a stabilizing action of
the colloidal suspension but also promote the formation of positive
charges on the silver surface.

For our DFT calculations on the
complexes of xanthine linked to one Ag ion, we used the hybrid functional
B3LYP in combination with two different basis sets: def2TZVPP and
a mixed basis set 6-311G++(d,p) for all atoms except silver, treated
with Lanl2DZ. Table S2 (Supporting Information)
reports the energies of the complexes calculated with the def2TVZPP
basis set. The N(9)H-A complex, where the silver adatom is linked
to the N(9)H tautomer in a bidentate way, is by far the most stable,
whereas the N(9)H-B complex exhibits marked instability. The complexes
with the N(7)H tautomer present similar energies. Moreover, the N(9)H-A
complex provides the largest molecule → metal charge transfer
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information),
as obtained from the Hirshfeld partial charges,43 reported in Table S3 (Supporting
Information) for the N(9)H-A complex.

As shown in Table 1, only the complex N(9)H-A is
able to reproduce satisfactorily all
observed SERS frequencies, in particular, those occurring in the 1200–1550
cm–1 spectral region and that around 1700 cm–1. Quite similar results are obtained by using the
mixed basis set, 6-311G++(d,p)/Lanl2DZ. Regarding the higher-frequency
bands, it can be observed that the stretching vibrations of the C=O
bonds that are not engaged in the interaction with metal are overestimated
by using both def2TZVPP and the mixed basis set, as previously observed,44 because the interactions with the molecules
of the water solvent are not taken into account in our calculation
models. Actually, it was ascertained that the C=O stretching
frequencies are largely overestimated when the protic solvent is not
considered in the DFT calculations.45−47

These computational results
suggest that the preferential adsorption
of xanthine on silver occurs with the N(9)H tautomer, by involving
both the N7 atom and the oxygen atom of the vicinal carbonyl group.
This is confirmed by comparing the observed SERS spectrum with that
calculated with all complexes, as shown in Figure 6 in the case of the def2TVZPP basis set.
Very similar results, by considering band frequencies and intensities,
are obtained with the mixed basis set, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Only the N(9)H-A complex
can simulate satisfactorily all experimental features, regarding both
positions and relative intensities of the SERS bands. In particular,
only this model is able to show the dominance of the SERS band around
650 cm–1, as well as the occurrence of the strong
SERS band around 1700 cm–1.

complexes, compared with the observed SERS spectrum of xanthine adsorbed

Finally, Figure 7 shows the normal modes, calculated with the def2TZVPP basis
set,
corresponding to the prominent SERS bands, observed at 647, 957, 1245,
1320, and 1704 cm–1, which may be considered as
“marker” bands of xanthine adsorbed on silver. All of
these bands are assigned to in-plane vibrations; in particular, the
dominant band at 657 cm–1 is attributable to the
ring breathing vibration, that at 957 cm–1 is attributable
to deformation of the imidazolic ring, those at 1245 and 1320 cm–1 are attributable to ring deformations mixed with
N-H bending vibrations, whereas that at 1704 cm–1 is attributable to the stretching mode of the C=O bond involved
in the binding with silver.

Concluding Remarks
Xanthine is a purine nucleobase
that is not present in DNA/RNA
chains but derives from the metabolic degradation of guanine and adenine,
as described in Figure 1. Abnormal levels of xanthine and uric acid (oxidation product of
xanthine) in the human body lead to the emergence of severe pathologies.
This work has shown how it is possible to use the SERS spectroscopy
in the early diagnosis of these diseases by determining the presence
of xanthine in body fluids. For this aim, we have obtained a strong
SERS activation in the NIR region, where fluorescence phenomena that
interfere with the SERS signal do not usually occur. Moreover, the
use of FT-Raman spectroscopy can allow the SERS investigation both
in vitro and in vivo, given that the laser exciting radiation at λ
= 1064 nm falls in the biological tissue transparency window. In the
present case, the strong FT-SERS activation is due to both electromagnetic
and chemical mechanisms: the first is due to the shift of the plasmon
band toward the infrared region; the second one is due to the formation
of charge-transfer complexes induced by the presence of chloride anions.48

We have identified and assigned the marker
bands in the SERS spectrum
of xanthine to detect this nucleobase in the presence of other organic
components. To do this, we have used the DFT computational approach,
as the interpretation of the SERS spectrum of xanthine is complicated
by the possible presence of two tautomers and of different complexes
formed by molecule–metal interactions. In particular, the DFT
simulations, based both on the frequencies and relative intensities
of the calculated spectra and on the calculated energies of the different
complexes, have allowed: (i) to recognize the tautomer N(9)H as the
molecular species linked to the silver nanoparticles, (ii) to identify
the molecular site involved in the interaction with silver, that is,
the N7 atom together with the vicinal carbonyl group, (iii) to highlight
the interaction of xanthine with silver, that is, a strong chemisorption
with a marked molecule → metal charge transfer, and (iiii)
to evidence the nature of the active sites of the metallic surface,
which are effectively modeled by positively charged silver atoms.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Silver Colloids
Stable Ag colloids were
prepared in triple distilled water by reducing silver nitrate with
sodium citrate at its boiling point, according to Lee and Meisel.30 Sodium citrate dehydrate (Sigma, purity ≥
99.5%) was added dropwise to AgNO3 (Aldrich, purity 99.9999%)
aqueous solution under vigorous stirring; the presence of citrate
ensured long-term colloidal stability. Silver colloids, used some
weeks after the preparation, had a pH value around 6. Xanthine (purity
≥ 99.5%), supplied by Sigma as purified by recrystallization,
was added to the Ag colloidal suspension in a 10–6 M final concentration. To observe an FT-SERS signal of xanthine,
NaCl was added to the Ag colloid in a 10–3 M final
concentration.

UV–Visible Absorption Measurements
Absorption
spectra of the silver colloidal suspensions were observed in the 200–1100
nm region by means of a Cary 5 Varian spectrophotometer.

Raman Measurements
Raman spectra of xanthine as a solid
sample, dissolved in acidic-neutral (around pH = 6) and alkaline (around
pH = 12) aqueous solutions or adsorbed on Ag colloidal nanoparticles,
were recorded with a Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectrometer (Bruker
Optics, Model MultiRam), equipped with a broad-range quartz beamsplitter,
an air-cooled Nd:YAG laser excitation source (1064 nm), and a Ge diode
detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. The instrument provided a spectral
range of 3600–50 cm–1 (Stokes shift). The
experiments were performed in a 180° geometry, with 200 mW of
laser power.

Computational Details
Calculations
were performed with the Gaussian 09 software.49 We adopted the hybrid B3LYP exchange-correlation
functional,50,51 along two different basis sets:
def2TZVPP52−54 and a mixed basis set made up of 6-311++G(d,p) for
nonmetal atoms and Lanl2DZ55−60 for silver. Calculations consisted of structural optimizations of
the tautomers of xanthine linked to metal adatoms, followed by vibrational
frequency calculations. We checked that all vibrational frequencies
were real and positive, thus belonging to geometries corresponding
to true potential energy minima.

The calculated Raman activities
(Ai) were converted to relative Raman
intensities (Ii) using the following relationship,
as reported in the
literature61,62  where
νo is the exciting
frequency (in cm–1 units); νi is
the vibrational frequency (in cm–1 units) of the ith normal mode; h, c, and k are fundamental constants; and f is a suitably chosen common normalization factor for all
peak intensities.
