Anthocyanins are bioactive compounds naturally found
in a variety of leaves, fruits, and vegetables. Anthocyanin pigments
undergo a modification in their chemical structure when exposed to
different concentrations of hydrogen ions, and they were extensively
studied to be used as active elements in biocompatible pH sensors.
The ocular pH is a significant parameter to assess the ocular physiology
in cases of postocular surgery, keratoconjunctivitis, and ocular rosacea.
Contact lenses have the potential to be used as medical diagnostic
devices for in situ continuous monitoring of the ocular physiology.
Here, anthocyanin-functionalized contact lenses were developed as
wearable sensors to monitor the ocular pH. Anthocyanin pigments were
extracted from Brassica oleracea and
used to functionalize the polymeric matrices of commercial soft contact
lenses by soaking and drop-casting processes. Contact lenses responded
to the physiological ocular pH of 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5, exhibiting a
systematic color shift from pink (pH 6.5) to purple (pH 7.0) and blue
(pH 7.5). The functionalization of contact lens sensors was evaluated
as a function of the dye concentration. Quantitative values were obtained
by comparing the RGB triplets of the colors obtained with the naturally
extracted dye and with delphinidin chloride dye in 0.0 to 1.5 mmol
L–1 aqueous solution. The functionalization of contact
lenses was studied as a function of the soaking time, resulting in
best results when soaking for 24 h. The dye leakage from the contact
lenses in deionized water was evaluated, and a negligible leakage
after 18 h was observed. Poly-2-hydroxy ethylmethacrylate contact
lenses were fabricated and cross-linked with anthocyanin dye, resulting
in a slight color shift upon pH changes from 6.5 to 7.4. Contact lens
pH sensors may be used to continuously monitor the ocular pH at point-of-care
settings.

Introduction
Anthocyanins are colored water-soluble
pigments contained in a range of edible fruits, vegetables, and flowers
and are consumed as dietary polyphenols.1 Primary anthocyanins found in nature include cyanidin, peonidin,
delphinidin, and petunidin. The chemical structure of anthocyanins
consists of a flavylium nucleus attached to one or more sugars, such
as d-glucose, d-galactose, l-rhamnose,
and d-arabinose.2 The chemical
stability of anthocyanins is influenced by pH, which induces a color
shift from red in acidic conditions to blue in basic conditions. Besides
their use as natural dyes, anthocyanins have shown antioxidative and
antimicrobial properties. They improve visual and neurological health;3 they were reported to induce a decrease in coronary
heart disease, and they were used as the main components in antidiabetic
preparations.4 Delphinidin chloride is
an anthocyanidin, and its antioxidant activity results from its degradation
products, such as gallic acid. Anthocyanidins induce a higher secretion
of immunosuppressive proteins, suggesting potential applications in
the treatment of autoimmune diseases.5 Other
studies showed that anthocyanidins decrease obesity and improve bone
density.6 There is an increasing need for
developing technologies to minimize microbial film formation in several
fields of application,7 and anthocyanin-functionalized
surfaces were reported to decrease bacterial adhesion.8

Anthocyanins were extensively studied in the field
of intelligent packaging to provide food preservation and detect food
deterioration. Anthocyanin-containing thin films were synthetized
with various methods. Thin layers were produced using anthocyanins
extracted from corn starch, glycerol, and blueberry powder and casted
to obtain colorimetric pH indicators.9,10 pH-sensitive
indicators were also synthetized by electrospinning in the form of
membranes for pharmaceutical applications. pH dyes were trapped within
ultrafine polymer fibers with a diameter of 510 nm, which exhibited
a color change from pink to green when exposed to acidic and alkaline
buffers, respectively.11 Naturally extracted
anthocyanins were extensively used as dopants to polymeric complexes,
such as polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan, to monitor food product quality
in real time associated with temperature and pH variations.12 Anthocyanins may be also immobilized on natural
solid matrices. Anthocyanins extracted from Ipomoea
batatas were immobilized on agar and potato starch
to produce pH-sensitive films in the range 2.0–10.0 to be used
as meat spoilage sensors.13 Another study
reported the usage of anthocyanins extracted from Brassica
oleracea as dopants in bacterial cellulose nanofibers.
Concentrations of anthocyanins from 32 to 193 mg L–1 induced a change in the morphological properties, thus in the colorimetric
response, of bacterial cellulose nanofibers as pH probes. This was
attributed to the chemical interactions occurring between the bacterial
cellulose membrane and anthocyanins, resulting in a decrease of the
diffraction intensities of bacterial cellulose upon the addition of
anthocyanin concentrates, which induced partial disintegration of
cellulose microfibrils. In contrast, the intrinsic morphology of the
nanofibers could be preserved by adding diluted anthocyanins, with
a clearer response to pH variations.14

With regard to the ocular environment, anthocyanins were found to
have beneficial effects on the retinal tissue.15−17 The staining effectiveness of anthocyanin
dyes was demonstrated in ex vivo pig eyes and their retinal biocompatibility
in in vitro retinal cells cultures.18 The
safety of intravitreal injection of anthocyanin dyes into rat eyes
was assessed by electroretinography (ERG) functional test, which measured
the electrical activity generated by retinal cells in response to
a light stimulus to assess retinal toxicity. ERG waveforms obtained
prior and after anthocyanin injection were comparable, suggesting
that anthocyanin dyes did not induce ocular toxicity. Additionally,
the oral intake of products containing anthocyanins was recently shown
to prevent the myopic refractory shift caused by working at visual
display terminals.15 Anthocyanins were
also reported to stimulate the regeneration of rhodopsin in the rod
outer segment membranes of frogs.17 Anthocyanins
accumulated in the ocular tissue have shown to improve visual function.16 These studies provide promising insights into
the ability of anthocyanins to prevent several oxidative stress-associated
diseases and indicate that anthocyanins might also be beneficial in
intraocular surgery. Future potential ocular applications of anthocyanin
dyes include vitreoretinal surgery and chromovitrectomy.18

Monitoring the ocular pH is highly desirable
at a point-of-care setting with a range of applications.19−21 Originally, human tear pH measurements
were carried out using glass electrodes in contact with the cornea,22 using fluorescent probes,20 glass probes,19 and microelectrodes.23 Healthy tear pH values range from 6.5 to 7.6.19,20 The significance of ocular pH was highlighted in relation to evaluating
the tear buffering capacity, associated to the monitoring of keratoconjunctivitis
sicca21 and to estimate the ocular penetration
of drugs.24 Hydrogen ion concentration
in the ocular microenvironment was targeted as a biomarker for the
early diagnosis of rosacea, which induces corneal melting and stromal
scarring.25,26 Ocular rosacea patients were reported to
have an ocular pH of up to 0.9 units higher when compared to healthy
controls.25 The tear pH was found to increase
in senile cataract patients, resulting in pH values ranging from 7.26
± 0.23 on the day before operation to 7.50 ± 0.23 on the
first postoperative day.27 In the increasingly
demanding field of wearable sensors for personalized medicine, contact
lens sensors are gaining increasing popularity to provide point-of-care
continuous monitoring.28,29

Here, a pH-sensitive contact
lens was developed to aid the monitoring of the ocular physiology.
A naturally occurring anthocyanin dye was chosen to target biocompatibility
and to ease the readout of the sensors. The anthocyanin dye was extracted
from B. oleracea, and its colorimetric
response was compared to commercial delphinidin chloride dye to quantify
the concentration of the dye suitable to functionalize contact lenses.
The anthocyanin dye extracted from B. oleracea was chosen in quality of being the most stable upon temperature
variations because of the acyl protection of the hydroxyl groups within
the molecule.30,31 The presence of the sugar in
anthocyanin allows the molecule to remain stable in water.32 Contact lens sensors exhibited a pH-dependent
color change when tested in pH buffer solutions of 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5.
The optical response was evaluated as a function of the concentration
of dye in the soaking solution and of the soaking time. Leakage tests
were conducted by storing dyed contact lenses in deionized (DI) water,
and analyzing the transmittance of the storage solution after 1 min
to 24 h. After 18 h, saturation of the leakage was observed. Lacreon
and lacreon-free contact lenses were tested. Poly-2-hydroxy ethylmethacrylate
(HEMA) contact lenses were cross-linked with anthocyanin dye to evaluate
the impact of the chemical processes on the color change.

Results and Discussion
Anthocyanin dye was extracted
from B. oleracea var capitata (red cabbage) and diluted in DI water at
different percentages to obtain pH-sensitive solution. Figure 1a shows the chemical structure
of the anthocyanin dye exposed to buffer solutions at pH 6.5, 7.0,
and 7.5 and the resulting contact lenses obtained by the soaking method.
The molecular structure of the anthocyanin dye changed when exposed
to different concentrations of hydrogen ions. At acidic pH conditions,
the flavylium cation allowed the molecule to absorb light and reflect
wavelengths in the red-pink area of the visible spectrum.33,34 At alkaline pH conditions, the molecule deprotonated because of
the hydration of the flavylium cation, and the pigment reflected wavelengths
in the blue-green area.35

Contact
lens pH sensors were obtained by impregnating the polymeric matrices
of commercial soft contact lenses with anthocyanin solution by soaking
and drop-casting processes, performed on either the concave or the
convex face of contact lenses (Figure 1b). Soft contact lenses were chosen over rigid gas
permeable lenses because of their higher hydrophilicity.36 Contact lens sensors were tested in the physiological
ocular pH range of 6.5–7.5. Figure 1c shows photographs of contact lenses dyed
with different methods. Micrographs of the cross section of contact
lenses are presented in Figure 1d. 1-Day ACUVUE Moist lenses with and without lacreon were
used and compared to evaluate the impact of lacreon on the dying process
toward an efficient colorimetric detection of hydrogen ions. As expected,37,38 lacreon-containing contact lenses held a higher concentration of
dye, which resulted in an enhanced moisture retain, and brighter colors
were distinguishable with the naked eye. The equivalent concentration
of the extracted dye in solution was calculated by comparing the transmission
spectra of contact lenses soaked in aqueous solutions containing the
naturally extracted dye at percentages of 25, 33, 50, 75, and 100%
(wt/wt) to contact lenses soaked in 0.35, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5
mM delphinidin chloride aqueous solution. In the soaking process,
the lens was submerged in 20 mL of dye aqueous solution for 24 h.
In the drop-casting method, 500 μL of dye aqueous solution was
poured on the convex/concave faces of the lens. The drop-casting method
led to limited distribution of the dye across the lens when compared
to the soaking method, which in turn resulted in a higher permeation
and a homogeneous spatial distribution of the dye. Drop-casting on
the concave and convex side of the lens led to a higher concentration
in the center and on the sides, respectively, as it was intuitive
in the case of curved surfaces.

Quantitative investigation of
color changes in dyed contact lenses exposed to pH buffer solutions
was carried out by measuring the RGB coordinates associated with the
color of the contact lens at pH levels of 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5, using
a smartphone camera and a color recognition application at laboratory
light levels of 200 lux. Figure 2 shows the percentages of RGB color variation of lacreon
(Figure 2a) and lacreon-free
(Figure 2b) contact
lenses soaked in aqueous solutions containing dye concentrations of
0.35–1.50 mmol L–1. Insets show the imaged
lens and the normalized color at different concentrations and pH values.
Lacreon-containing contact lenses reported a color variation that
was more easily distinguishable with the naked eye for all concentration
values tested. At pH 7.5, lacreon-containing contact lenses exhibited
a blue color with different intensities and saturations upon variations
in the concentration of the dye in solution. Lacreon-free contact
lenses exhibited a purple-blue color, often not distinguishable from
the color at pH 7.0 with the naked eye. Moreover, lacreon-containing
contact lenses exhibited a more homogeneous color. Both contact lenses
showed bright colors that reached RGB percentages of up to 90% when
imaged at a distance of 5.0 cm and at ambient light conditions of
200 lux. Lacreon-containing contact lenses were therefore chosen over
lacreon-free contact lenses and prepared by the soaking method for
further characterizations.

The spectral characterization was
performed in the transmission mode with the setup depicted in Figure 3a. The transmission
spectra of dyed contact lenses in 0.5 mM solutions showed two peaks
at wavelengths 470 nm (blue) and 660 nm (red) (Figure 3b–d). At pH 6.5, both lacreon-containing
and lacreon-free dyed contact lenses exhibited two peaks at 470 and
660 nm, with intensities of 1.03 and 1.02, respectively. The depths
of the green-yellow band reported maxima of 60% and 40%, for lacreon-free
and lacreon-containing dyed contact lenses, respectively. At pH 7.0,
the intensity ratios in the transmission spectra for lenses were 1.13
and 1.66 and the depths of the green-yellow bands yielded maxima of
the 50% and the 22%, for lacreon-free and lacreon-containing dyed
contact lenses, respectively (Figure 3c). At pH 7.5, the transmission spectra of lacreon-containing
lenses showed a suppression of the red band, with an intensity ratio
of 2.5. However, lacreon-containing contact lenses showed the highest
intensity peak, which reached 100% at 660 nm (Figure 3d). Changes in the intensity ratio of the
two peaks and of the depths of the green-yellow band (500–650
nm) indicated the color shift of contact lens sensors. Figure 3e–g shows the transmission
spectra of lacreon-containing contact lenses at pH levels of 6.5,
7.0, and 7.5, as a function of the concentration of the dye in solution.
A decreasing trend was observed in the depth of the 500–650
nm band and in the peak at 660 nm upon increasing the concentration
of the dye in solution.

bars: 2.0 mm.

To test the effect of the soaking time
on the dying process, contact lenses were soaked in anthocyanin solution
for 1 min, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Transmission spectra were acquired
at each step (Figure 4a). A systematic increase of the peak intensity at 660 nm was observed
in the transmission spectra of dyed contact lenses when increasing
the soaking time. This resulted in a higher permeation of the dye
within the polymer matrix and thus in a brighter color. After 24 h,
the transmission intensity at 660 nm saturated. The dye leakage was
evaluated by storing contact lenses in distilled water for 1 min,
3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Figure 4b shows the transmission spectra of the aqueous solution upon
storing the dyed contact lens for different time intervals. As expected,
dye leakage in DI water increased when increasing the storage time,
with saturation after 18 h.

To explore alternative methods to
fabricate pH-sensitive contact lenses, poly-HEMA soft contact lenses
were fabricated and cross-linked with the anthocyanin dye during the
photopolymerization process. For studying the dye leakage for the
in-house-made contact lens, the lens was immersed in a buffer solution
at room temperature and the transmission spectra were acquired after
1, 2, and 3 h. Followed by soaking the lens in a buffer solution at
a temperature of 90 °C for 15 min, the transmission spectrum
was recorded again. The transmission spectra of the lens over time
were comparable, even when it was immersed in a high-temperature buffer,
indicating robust polymer-anthocyanin dye cross-linking within the
contact lens matrix (Figure 5a).

pH 6.5 and 7.4. (a) Transmission spectra of the anthocyanin-cross-linked
poly-HEMA contact lenses after immersion in a saline solution for

lens submerged in buffer solutions at pH 6.5 and 7.4, at ambient temperature.
The insets show photographs of contact lenses exposed to different
pH values. Scale bar: 2.0 mm.

The transmission spectra of poly-HEMA contact lenses
exhibited an absorption peak at 540 nm, while commercial contact lenses
dyed by the soaking method presented an absorption peak around 490
nm. The absorption band of poly-HEMA (in-house-made) lens was wider
as compared to commercial contact lenses tinted via immersion, which
reflect a modification of the chemical structure of the anthocyanin
dye during the cross-linking process (Figure 5b). Poly-HEMA lenses appeared peach red at
pH 6.5 and gradually shifted to darker red shades when pH increased
up to 7.4 showing a slight color shift, which is difficult to be recognized
easily by the naked eye. Therefore, for developing contact lenses
that function as a pH sensor, we expect that cross-linking anthocyanin
dye with other hydrogel matrices such as poly vinyl alcohol or polyacrylamide
might result in a more significant color change with pH.

Conclusions
Contact lens sensors were developed for
continuous monitoring of ocular pH variations with a minimally invasive
approach. Commercial lacreon and lacreon-free contact lenses were
functionalized by soaking and drop-casting processes using anthocyanin
aqueous solutions. Lacreon contact lenses exhibited brighter and more
uniform color distribution, which could be observed with the naked
eye in the physiological pH range 6.5–7.5. The color variation
was evaluated based on the concentration of the dye in solution, from
0.35 to 1.5 mmol L–1, and of the soaking time (1
min to 24 h). The leakage of contact lens sensors was evaluated by
storing DI water for up to 24 h. Poly-HEMA contact lenses were fabricated
and cross-linked with anthocyanin dye to evaluate an alternative method
for incorporating the dye within the polymeric matrix. Further studies
may include in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility tests.

Materials and Methods
Materials
1-Day ACUVUE Moist LACREON and LACREON-free
soft contact lenses were purchased from Johnson & Johnson. 2-Hydroxyethyl
methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone,
and delphinidin chloride were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification.

Optical Characterization Setup
An optical fiber was
coupled into a port of an upright optical microscope (Zeiss). Broadband
white light was used to illuminate the contact lens, and the transmission
spectrum was obtained in the opposite direction by an optical fiber
connected to a spectrometer (Maya Pro-2000, Ocean Optics).

Extraction of the Anthocyanin Dye
Anthocyanin dye was
extracted from B. oleracea, which was
sliced and soaked in DI water (3:2, wt/vol). The mixture was boiled
and simmered for 10 min to allow the diffusion of the dye. The slices
were removed, and the aqueous solution was filtered and stored at
4 °C until usage. Another dye solution was obtained by dissolving
delphinidin chloride in DI water to obtain solution with concentrations
0.35, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mmol L–1.

Fabrication of Contact Lens Sensors
Contact lenses
were dyed by soaking and drop-casting. In the soaking process, only
commercial contact lenses were soaked in 20 mL of dye aqueous solution
for 1 min, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. In the drop-casting method, 500
μL of dye aqueous solution was poured on the convex/concave
faces of contact lenses.

Fabrication of Poly-HEMA Contact Lens Sensors
The anthocyanin
dye (0.2 wt/vol %) was dissolved in DI water, and HEMA (80 vol/vol
%) was mixed with the dye aqueous solution. The photoinitiator, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone
(1 vol/vol %), and the cross-linker ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(5 vol/vol %) were added to the monomer solution. The mixture was
pipetted to the contact lens mold and cured under UV light (λ
= 365 nm) for 5 min.
