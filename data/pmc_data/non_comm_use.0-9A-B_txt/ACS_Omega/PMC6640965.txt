Chemical
doping has been widely used to finely tune the electrical
properties of organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) that find
widespread applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, to
shed light on the precise role of chemical p-doping in affecting the
charge-transport properties of HTMs and photovoltaic performance of
PSCs, two kinds of representative dopants, including lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
(LiTFSI) and two Co(III) complexes tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III)tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide]
(FK209) and tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine]cobalt(III)tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide]
(FK102), are employed as the p-type dopant models to dope the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine]-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) HTM. Both dopants can facilitate the generation of
oxidized spiro-OMeTAD radical cation and improve hole mobility. Co-doping
of FK209 and LiTFSI is necessary to achieve an optimal doping property
and best device performance with power conversion efficiency of 17.8%
compared to that of the FK209-doped device (13.5%) and the LiTFSI-doped
device (15%). UV–vis absorption, space-charge-limited current
measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements have confirmed that with the co-doping of the two kinds
of p-dopants in a proper ratio the doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a high
charge carrier mobility and charge carrier transfer/collection capability.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic
hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have
received considerable attention as one of the most promising candidates
for the next generation of high-efficiency, low-cost thin film photovoltaics
due to their appealing features of large absorption coefficient, broadband
light absorption, tunable band gap, long charge carrier diffusion
length, excellent ambipolar charge mobility, low nonradiative recombination
rate, and simple fabrication.1−4 Significant efforts have been devoted to the achievement
of high performance of PSCs, including optimizing the morphology,5,6 crystallization process,7,8 and composition manipulation
of the perovskite active layer9,10 and also the interface
engineering between the perovskite and electrodes,11−13 enabling the
power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs leaping from 3.8% to over
20% in a relatively short period.14,15 Very recently,
a certified world record PCE of 22.1% was obtained, making PSCs comparable
to current commercial technologies.4,16

In PSCs,
organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are usually
employed to play a crucial role in charge transport, extraction, and
retardation of undesired charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM
interface.17,18 Although several simplified PSC
devices without hole-transporting layers (HTLs) have been developed,
PCE of only 10–12.8% was achieved.17,19,20 Therefore, the development of devices incorporating
HTMs between the perovskite and metal electrode in PSCs remains an
attractive goal. In this regard, numerous HTMs have been explored,
including organic small molecules, conjugated polymers, and p-type
inorganic semiconductors, resulting in reasonable efficiencies of
13–18%.17,21−26 Only few can reach efficiency over 20%, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine]-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD), polytriarylamine, and the recently reported 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)
spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-flurene]
(FDT).4,10,15,27

Among these effective HTMs used in PSCs to
date, the amorphous
organic molecule spiro-OMeTAD, which is first synthesized by Grätzel’s
group and traditionally employed as a solid-state replacement for
liquid electrolyte in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs),28 has now shown to be the most efficient. However,
most of the organic HTMs suffer from low hole mobility and conductivity
in their pristine form, even the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD, which
leads to slower charge transport and a decreased efficiency. One of
the most useful strategies to increase the charge-transport capacity
and alter the conductivity of the organic hole conductor is employing
chemical p-type doping. Hence, p-type dopants or ionic additives such
as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and cobalt
complexes, namely, tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III)tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)
imide] (FK209) and tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine]cobalt(III)tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)
imide] (FK102), are developed and shown to significantly increase
the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD to some extent
in ssDSCs and PSCs.25,29,30 In addition, other kinds of p-type dopants or additives have also
been widely studied for the improvement of conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD,
such as Ag-TFSI,31,32 F4-TCNQ,33 protic ionic liquids,34 SnCl4,35 CuI,36 CuSCN,37 copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPC),38 and iridium complex,39 resulting in improved PCE of ssDSCs and PSCs effectively.

The doped HTMs are generally closely dependent on the doping conditions,
such as the ambient environment including moisture, oxygen, and light.
This ambience dependence may be the cause of the poor stability and
reproducibility of the devices.
Thus, it is a great challenge to precisely control the oxidation process
and improve the device reproducibility, as the oxidation-induced charge
dynamics is complicated and susceptible to extrinsic environment.
For instance, the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD can only be achieved upon
air exposure when LiTFSI is doped, which is actually dependent on light.40,41 Qi et al. reported that ambient air exposure, especially the humidity,
would cause the LiTFSI dopant to redistribute across the whole spiro-OMeTAD
films, resulting in an increased conductivity. They also suggested
that controlled environments of H2O vapor and dry O2 could individually enhance the conductivity and mobility
of LiTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD films to a certain extent.42 In addition, Qi and co-workers also observed
decrease in charge mobility when spiro-OMeTAD films were exposed to
air, O2, and H2O.43 Meng et al. and Qi et al. reported that tert-butylpyridine
(tBP) functioned as a morphology controller for HTL
films in PSCs. It could effectively reduce phase separation of LiTFSI
and spiro-OMeTAD in the stock solution before spin-coating, leading
to a uniform HTL film by decreasing inhomogeneous areas, which further
helped realize uniform charge-transport properties across the HTL
and long-term device stability.44,45 Furthermore, Snaith’s
group reported that the steady-state efficiency of PSCs with a mesoporous
structure was closely related to the use of tBP in
HTLs. They proposed that tBP could improve the charge
selectivity of the perovskite/HTL interface for holes through the
chemical interaction between tBP and perovskite,
independent of the nature of HTM used, thus resulting in an increment
in the steady-state efficiency. Besides, they also found that tBP is likely to induce p-doping of the perovskite layer.46 Seok and co-workers studied the comparative
effect of Co(III) complex FK209 and the co-doping of FK209 and Li
salt on the electrical conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD and the performance
of mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction PSCs. They concluded that the addition of
FK209 to spiro-OMeTAD could effectively enhance the open-circuit voltage
(Voc) because of the reduced carrier recombination
and lower Fermi level of HTM and that the synergistic effect of FK209
and LiTFSI resulted
in a PCE of 10.4%.47 Efforts have been
made in previous studies to understand the poorly defined doping mechanism
of the p-dopants on HTMs and the effects of extrinsic environment
on it, as well as the effect of doping on the performance of ssDSCs
and PSCs; most of them are about the functionality of the doped spiro-OMeTAD
film itself or the resulting photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs
with a mesoporous oxide layer.
Considering the crucial role of HTMs in hole transport and extraction
and the rapid increase in the efficiency of planar PSCs that have
a simpler structure and better reproducibility, the studies on the
p-doping mechanism of HTMs may provide an effective strategy to further
boost the PCEs of planar heterojunction PSCs; however, a deep understanding
of the specific effect of p-doping on the charge-transport properties
of the HTMs and how it affects the charge carrier dynamics at the
perovskite/HTL interface are still lacking.
To further improve the device performance, systematic investigations
on the effect of p-doping on the interface properties between the
perovskite layer and HTL and the overall photovoltaic behavior of
PSCs are desirable.

In this study, we investigated two kinds
of representative dopants
including LiTFSI and two Co(III) complexes FK102 and FK209 (as shown
in Figure 1) that find
important applications in PSCs as the “redox active”
p-type dopant model. We introduced small-molecule spiro-OMeTAD doped
with the above different dopants as the HTL in PSCs, with CH3NH3PbI3–XClX as the light absorber and TiO2 as
the electron transport layer (ETL). The effects of these dopants on
the electrical properties of HTM, charge-transport properties at the
perovskite/HTM interface, and the resulting device characteristics
are systematically studied. We found that the incorporation of either
LiTFSI or Co(III) complexes into spiro-OMeTAD could effectively generate
charge carriers and improve its hole mobility. When LiTFSI and FK209
(FK102) are codoped in spiro-OMeTAD in a proper ratio, approximately
2 orders of magnitude increment in hole mobility is observed compared
to that in the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD film. It also increases the
fill factor (FF), Jsc, and open-circuit
voltage (Voc) of PSCs simultaneously,
leading to a better device performance, which is primarily due to
the improved charge carrier mobility, increased hole-collection efficiency,
and reduced charge carrier recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface.
As a result, for PSCs based on the mixed dopants, a high efficiency
of 17.8%, with a Voc of 1.1 V, Jsc of 21.7 mA/cm2, and FF of 0.74,
is achieved, which is higher than that of LiTFSI-doped device and
Co(III)-doped device by 20–30%.

Results and Discussion
PSCs with a planar n–i–p
architecture of FTO/TiO2/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3–XClX/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (Figure 2a) were fabricated
in this study to investigate the role of these dopants in affecting
the charge-transport properties at the perovskite/HTM interface and
the resulting device characteristics. Here, the compact TiO2/PCBM layer serves as an ETL, wherein the PCBM layer is employed
to passivate the defects of the bottom TiO2 layer and diminish
the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis.48 Spiro-OMeTAD
is used as the HTM, where chemical additives, including LiTFSI and
two cobalt complexes FK102 and FK209, are introduced to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD.
It is notable that the single tBP-mixed spiro-OMeTAD
is not considered in this work. One of the main reasons is that tBP is a polar solvent similar to γ-butyrolactone
(GBL), which shows good solubility for perovskite. It is most probable
that tBP can erode the perovskite film within the
cell, which is a great threat to the long-term stability of PSCs.49,50 Thus, small amount of tBP is commonly used together
with LiTFSI as an additive to promote the dissolution of Li salt and
to prevent phase separation of LiTFSI and spiro-OMeTAD, leading to
a uniform HTL film.44,45 Herein, the corrosion effect
of tBP on perovskite films is demonstrated by UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy (Figure S1). The
CH3NH3PbI3–XClX film was fabricated by the traditional
one-step solvent engineering method, and a continuous uniform perovskite
film was obtained as shown in Figure 2b. The energy level diagram of each component in PSCs
is depicted in Figure 2c. In the case of PCBM, the valance band and conduction band are
around −5.8 and −4.1 eV, respectively, which can reduce
the energy mismatch between TiO2 and the perovskite layer
and thus facilitate electron transport from perovskite to the TiO2 layer while blocking the holes. The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) energy level of spiro-OMeTAD lies near −5.2
eV and well-matched with that of CH3NH3PbI3–XClX (−5.4
eV) for efficient hole extraction.51Figure 2d shows the cross-sectional
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a representative spiro-OMeTAD-based
device in which the mixture of FK209 and LiTFSI is added as the dopant,
indicating a clear layer-by-layer structure of the device.

J–V characteristics for
PSCs using different dopants measured under standard AM 1.5G of 100
mW/cm2 are represented in Figure 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters
are summarized in Table 1. The statistical analysis is also shown in Figure 4. All of the devices are fabricated by the
same experimental process except for the different doping conditions.
Here, dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD is denoted pristine-spiro and FK102-
and FK209-incorporated spiro-OMeTAD’s are represented as FK102-spiro
and FK209-spiro, respectively, and when doped with LiTFSI + tBP, FK102 + LiTFSI + tBP, and FK209 +
LiTFSI + tBP, the HTMs are named Li-spiro, FK102/Li-spiro,
and FK209/Li-spiro, respectively.
The chemical dopants greatly affect the photovoltaic performance of
PSCs. The devices based on dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD possess an average
PCE of 5.3% with a Jsc of 19.05 ±
0.75 mA/cm2, Voc of 1.02 ±
0.02 V, and FF of 26.9 ± 3.3%, and the poor FF is obviously the
main reason that limits their performance, which is critically related
to the strong hole accumulation and high carrier recombination in
the device caused by the low hole mobility and conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD
in its pristine form.25 Using the Co(III)
complexes FK102 and FK209 as dopants, we observed an increased device
performance compared to that of the pristine-spiro-based PSCs. The
best-performing device based on FK209-spiro shows a Jsc of 20.5 mA/cm2, Voc of 1.08 V, FF of 61.2%, and an overall PCE of 13.51%. Although the
FK102-spiro-based PSC exhibits an efficiency of only 11.5%; with a Jsc of 20.12 mA/cm2, Voc of 1.05 V, and a poor FF of 54.5%, which shows a great
improvement compared to that in the pristine device; it is much inferior
to the FK209-spiro-based PSC. The difference in performance parameters
and primarily in FFs for the PSCs using the two Co(III) complexes
as p-dopants is quite beyond our expectation as only tert-butyl groups are introduced as endcaps in the pyridine–pyrazole
ligand for FK209 as compared with the molecular structure of FK102
(as shown in Figure 1). It is known that the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD is accompanied
by the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II), which has been confirmed by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure S2. Taking FK209 for example, the Co 2p3/2 peak in the FK209 film centered at 782.9 eV corresponds
to that of Co3+ in FK209. For FK209/Li-spiro and FK209-spiro
films, the Co 2p3/2 peak becomes broaden with the peak
intensity obviously decreased and the Co 2p3/2 peak position
shifts to a lower binding energy. This proves the formation of a low
valence state of Co. Additionally, the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD using
Co(III) oxidants is an equilibrium reaction, which means that both
the reacted and unreacted Co complexes will remain in the HTM solutions.
Thus, the enhanced solubility of FK209 induced by the tert-butyl group brings out a better dispersion of the Co(II) salt in
the spiro-OMeTAD matrix, obviating crystallization of the Co(II) salt
in the solution and increasing charge carrier transport in the HTL.
In addition, FK209 is reported to show higher Co(III)-to-spiro-OMeTAD+ conversion yield than that by
FK102, and the concentration of the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD radical
cation is closely correlated with charge-transport resistance at the
perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces and the final performance.29 Meanwhile, the series resistance (Rs) for FK209-spiro obtained from the J–V curves measured in the light is lower
(9.79 Ω cm2) than that of FK102-spiro (11.19 Ω
cm2), corresponding to the higher Jsc for the FK209-spiro-based device (Table 1). By applying Li-spiro as a HTM, a significantly
enhanced performance is also observed as shown in Figure 3, especially in terms of Jsc and FF. FF is greatly improved to 60.9 ±
3.8%, combined with an increased Jsc of
20.18 ± 0.68 mA/cm2 and Voc of 1.08 ± 0.02 V, yielding the average PCE of 13.9%. The champion
device achieves a PCE of 15% and FF of 64.7%. LiTFSI shows a positive
effect on spiro-OMeTAD in generating free carriers, which might further
help in decreasing interface-related recombination and improving the
charge collection efficiency, resulting in a great increase in Jsc and FF (Figure 4a,c). This is also in agreement with the
changes in Rs. Rs decreases from 37.15 (in pristine-spiro PSCs) to 8.36 Ω
cm2 with the incorporation of LiTFSI into spiro-OMeTAD;
the increased Jsc and decreased Rs for Li-spiro-based PSCs suggest a lower charge-transport
resistance and higher hole extraction efficiency from perovskite to
the anode.52 Upon further addition of the
Co(III) complex into Li-spiro, the FF and Jsc are strikingly increased compared with those for the Li-spiro-based
PSCs. The FK209/Li-spiro based devices achieved an average PCE of
16.4%, with a Jsc of 20.13 ± 0.57
mA/cm2, Voc of 1.09 ±
0.02 V, and FF of 70.3 ± 3.8% (the best-performing device shows
a remarkable Jsc of 21.7 mA/cm2, a FF of 74.1%, and an overall PCE of 17.8%). As seen from Table 1, the shunt resistance
(Rsh) of the FK209/Li-spiro-based device
is significantly increased to 1758 Ω cm2 as compared
to that of the Li-spiro-based device (947 Ω cm2).
The Rsh is critically related to the leakage
current of the photovoltaic device, which would induce interface carrier’s
recombination. The higher Rsh in FK209/Li-spiro-based
PSCs indicates that less leakage current occurs in the device and
subsequently generates higher FF value. Meanwhile, a decreased Rs of 5.24 Ω cm2 was also observed,
both of which are well-consistent with the observations of the photovoltaic
performance for FK209/Li-spiro. The devices using FK102/Li-spiro have
a similar trend to FK209/Li-spiro. These results reveal that the combined
use of LiTFSI and Co(III) salt shows better hole doping for spiro-OMeTAD
to generate free carriers and improve its hole mobility, thereby achieving
a win–win situation for the reduced charge recombination and
efficient hole transport and extraction from perovskite to the anode.

Apart
from the FF and Jsc, Voc increases from 1.03 V for pristine-spiro-based
PSCs to 1.08 V for Li-spiro-based PSCs and 1.09 V for FK209/Li-spiro-based
PSCs (Figure 4b). The Voc is primarily determined by the difference
between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO level
of HTMs (spiro-OMeTAD with different dopants) for the PSCs, which
is related to the potential losses (defined as Eg – qVoc)
in the photovoltaic system. The Voc/Eg ratio is generally used to estimate the potential
loss,9 and the Voc/Eg ratios for PSCs using pristine-spiro,
FK209-spiro, Li-spiro, and FK209/Li-spiro are 0.64, 0.66, 0.67, and
0.68, respectively. The Voc/Eg value becomes higher with the use of p-type dopants,
especially for the FK209/Li-spiro, which means that a reduced charge
recombination and less potential loss occurred in the device with
the co-addition of LiTFSI and FK209, which is responsible for its
increased FF and improved PCE. On the other hand, the hole doping
of spiro-OMeTAD can facilitate the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD.
This would lead to a shift of its intrinsic HOMO level to a lower
level that further expands the gap between the quasi-Fermi level of
TiO2 and the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in a
higher Voc.30,40 Therefore,
the higher Voc of FK209/Li-spiro-based
PSCs suggests the superior hole-doping ability of the combination
of LiTFSI and the Co(III) complex into the HTM, which has been further
confirmed later.

Figures 3b and S3 show the IPCE spectra of the champion PSCs
using these different dopants. The p-dopants greatly affect the IPCE
curves. The IPCEs of FK209/Li-spiro- and FK102/Li-spiro-based devices
exhibit higher values compared to those of Li-spiro and FK209-spiro
within the wavelength range of 400–740 nm, with a maximum value
of 90% (FK209/Li-spiro) at 510 nm, which is in good agreement with
the increase in the measured Jsc.

To more fully elucidate the above PSC performance, the spiro-OMeTAD
films prepared under different doping conditions were studied in detail.
The hole-doping level, that is, the concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD
radical cations, is found to have great influence on the charge-transport
resistance at the HTM/active-layer interface and thereby on the overall
performance of PSCs. The oxidized spiro-OMeTAD can be easily monitored
by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy in chlorobenzene (CB) solution
with a characteristic absorption band at 520 nm.53Figure 5a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of spiro-OMeTAD with
different dopants in CB solution, where all solutions are stored in
the dark before the measurement. To clearly compare the hole-doping
effects of different dopants on spiro-OMeTAD to generate additional
charge carriers, the doping concentrations for UV–vis absorption
measurement are kept consistent with those used for device fabrication.
The concentration for the spiro-OMeTAD matrix in CB solution is 7.35
× 10–6 M; for other doped HTMs, different amounts
of dopants are further added into the matrix solutions, the corresponding
dopant concentrations are as follows: Li-spiro, 2.66 × 10–4 M LiTFSI; FK102-spiro or FK209-spiro, 5.63 ×
10–5 M FK102 or FK209, respectively; and FK102/Li-spiro
or FK209/Li-spiro, 2.66 × 10–4 M LiTFSI and
5.63 × 10–5 M FK102 or FK209, respectively.
It can be seen that dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD displays an intense absorption
band at 390 nm, when doped with Co(III) oxidants, or the mixture of
the Co(III) complex and LiTFSI, a new absorption band appears at 520
nm whether the existence of LiTFSI or not. Because FK102 and FK209,
as well as their Co(II) analogues, show negligible absorption in the
visible region, the peak at 520 nm can be ascribed to the monocation
radical of spiro-OMeTAD (spiro+), indicating that charge
transfer occurs between spiro-OMeTAD and the Co(III) oxidant.29,30,60 It is notable that the ratio
of absorption intensity at 520 nm to the value at 390 nm for FK209/Li-spiro
and FK102/Li-spiro is obviously much higher than that of FK209-spiro
to FK102-spiro, indicating the formation of high levels of spiro+. As the doping concentration in this work for each dopant
is maintained, we can conclude that the co-doping of Co(III) oxidants
and ionic additive LiTFSI exhibits a superior hole-doping level, thus
contributing to the performance improvement, which coincides well
with the aforementioned photovoltaic behavior.

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis absorption
spectra of spiro-OMeTAD in CB solution
with different doping conditions. The inset shows the enlarged view
of the absorption peak at 520 nm. (b) UV–vis absorption spectra
of Li-spiro in CB solution measured after storage in the dark and
illumination under standard AM 1.5G of 100 mW/cm2 for 30
min.

The oxidation reaction between
spiro-OMeTAD and oxygen is reported
to be a photoinduced reaction, which can be accelerated by LiTFSI
and does not occur in the absence of either light or oxygen.53 During the oxidation process, photons
participate in the reaction, whereas LiTFSI does not directly involve
in the reaction but instead acts as a catalyst to promote the oxidative
reaction upon air exposure. Lithium ions can react with oxygen to
generate lithium oxide, facilitating the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD;
meanwhile, bulk anion TFSI– (shown in Figure 1) acts as a counterion to stabilize
the spiro-OMeTAD cation radical.31,40,41,54−56 As a result, Li-spiro stored in the dark does not show any absorption
signal at 520 nm due to the inhibited photoinduced oxidization. To
further confirm the light-driven oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD with LiTFSI,
the absorption spectra of Li-spiro in CB solution after 30 min illumination
under AM 1.5G of 100 mW/cm2 were also recorded, as shown
in Figure 5b. The absorption
band of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD at 520 nm can be clearly recognized
after illumination, suggesting the occurrence of the oxidation reaction
between spiro-OMeTAD and LiTFSI, which results in a significant increase
in the concentration of spiro+. The result can be further
demonstrated by the absorption spectra of these HTM films as prepared
and after illumination, as shown in Figure S3. As it can be observed, the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD film shows
a very weak absorption band at ∼550 nm, originated from oxidized
spiro-OMeTAD. A similar behavior for the absorption band at 440–800
nm is also observed for Li-spiro. It is probably due to the oxidation
reaction between spiro-OMeTAD and oxygen during the spin-coating process
and absorption test, during which light is unavoidable. When FK209
was added into spiro-OMeTAD, regardless of the presence of LiTFSI,
the absorption spectra of FK209-spiro and FK209/Li-spiro rose from
440 to 800 nm with a relatively high intensity, indicating the formation
of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD, which is attributed to the charge transfer
interaction between spiro-OMeTAD and FK209. It is notable that with
the 30 min illumination treatment, those bands of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD
for Li-spiro and FK209/Li-spiro films ranging from 440 to 800 nm are
obviously enhanced due to the light-driven oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD
with LiTFSI. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the use of these
two Co(III) oxidants can faciliate the oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD
(i.e., the formation of spiro+) by light-independent charge
transfer interaction between the Co(III) complex and spiro-OMeTAD
even in the dark, enabling FK102 and FK209 to act as stable and effective
p-dopants for the organic semiconductors.

In addition, Figure S4 shows the difference
in the photovoltaic performance of the device based on Li-spiro measured
directly after preparation and after storage under ambient air with
a controlled humidity of 15% (about 16 h). It can be observed that
the PCE for Li-spiro is greatly enhanced by 25% after exposure to
the air with the relative humidity lower than 30% to prevent the decomposition
of the perovskite layer. The performance boost is primarily dominated
by the increased FF (Table S1). Actually,
a similar trend but with much smaller changes is also observed for
the Co(III) oxidants. The behavior can be attributed to two possible
factors: one is the improved ohmic contact between the HTL and the
metal anode because of the diffusion of oxygen into the spiro-OMeTAD/Ag
interface, which creates a thin silver oxide layer on the surface
of Ag and decreases its work function from −4.3 to −5.1
eV, thus improving the charge collection efficiency.58 Another one is that the oxidization mechanism of spiro-OMeTAD
is primarily dependent on the spectral ranges. In the long-wavelength
range (>450 nm), the oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD can be enhanced
with
the assistance of perovskite.41 Thus, a
higher amount of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD was formed after a certain
time of storage in air, which increased the conductivity of the spiro-OMeTAD
layer and enhanced charge transfer at the Ag/Spiro-OMeTAD interface,
improving the PSC performance. Moreover, for Li-spiro, the exposure
to air can drive the oxidation process to completion as both oxygen
and light play a critical role in the oxidization process. The product,
spiro-OMeTAD radical cation, can increase the hole concentration and
charge carrier mobility of the HTM layer, leading to decreased charge
recombination and high FF values. However, for Co(III)-doped HTM,
it is not clear yet whether any chemical process with oxygen or moisture
occurred during the storage. A deep understanding of the effect of
light, oxygen, and moisture on the interface properties of the perovskite
layer and the Co(III)-doped HTL and the performance of PSCs will be
discussed in detail in our future study.

The hole mobilities
of the doped spiro-OMeTAD films are also measured
using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method to further understand
the chemical p-type doping effect on the hole-transporting properties
of the HTM, for which
the hole-only devices with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTMs/Au
are fabricated in this study. J–V characteristics are measured under dark conditions, as shown in Figures 6 and S5. The mobility of pristine-spiro-OMeTAD is
calculated to be 1.47 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1. The extracted hole
mobilities of FK209/Li-spiro and FK102/Li-spiro are 1.1 × 10–3 and 5.33 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively, both
of which are considerably higher than those of the Li-spiro (2.27
× 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1), FK209-spiro (8.9 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1) and
FK102-spiro (3.62 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1) films. The higher hole mobility
of FK209/Li-spiro (FK102/Li-spiro) can be ascribed to the synthetic
effect of the Co(III) oxidant and LiTFSI, which exhibits a higher
doping level as mentioned, thus contributing to the improved device
efficiency and, in particular, to high FF values. The observed association
between the hole mobility and the PCE of PSCs based on different dopants
suggests the importance of high charge carrier mobility, which is
mainly dominated by p-doping in this study.

(b) The hole mobility characteristics of FK209/Li-spiro, FK209-spiro,
Li-spiro, and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD obtained from the SCLC J–V curves of hole-only devices
under dark conditions.

To investigate the charge transfer processes associated with
these
p-type dopants in spiro-OMeTAD at the perovskite and doped-HTL interface,
steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay transient
spectra were recorded for these thin films prepared on glass substrates
and the thickness of the perovskite film was maintained at an identical
level. As can be seen from Figure 7a, the CH3NH3PbI3–XClX film itself displays
a strong emission peak near 770 nm, and PL is significantly quenched
when the spiro-OMeTAD layer (with/without dopants) is covered onto
the perovskite films, suggesting efficient charge carrier transfer
at the perovskite/HTM interface. The PL intensity at 770 nm is observed
to be quenched to around 1.5 and 1.0% for perovskite covered by FK209-spiro
and Li-spiro, respectively, in comparison to that for the perovskite
film. The FK209/Li-spiro-based bilayer film exhibits almost entirely
quenched PL with ∼0.6% PL intensity, indicating that FK209/Li-spiro
can extract holes into the HTL more efficiently. The PL lifetime of
these bilayer thin films was measured by monitoring the peak emission
at 770 nm. The PL decay spectra are fitted with a biexponential decay
model, as shown in Figures 7b and S6. The related fitted decay
times are summarized in Table S2, in which
the lifetimes for fast decay (τ1) and slow decay
(τ2) are included. It is known that the fast and
slow decay processes reflect the charge carrier capturing by defects
and the radiative decay process, respectively; the latter is mainly
associated with the charge carrier transfer process across the interfaces.59 Hence, in this study, slow decay lifetimes are
used for comparison. The pristine CH3NH3PbI3–XClX film exhibits the largest PL lifetime with τ2 of 117.18 ns, whereas the PL lifetimes are significantly
shortened when spiro-OMeTAD with dopants is coated onto perovskite.
The τ2 values are calculated to be 31.46, 25.99,
22.35, 16.67, and 12.38 ns for perovskite films containing the doped
HTMs FK102-spiro, FK209-spiro, Li-spiro, FK102/Li-spiro, and FK209/Li-spiro,
respectively. All of them reduce the PL lifetime to a greater degree
than that by
perovskite/pristine-spiro (τ2 = 60.78 ns), with perovskite/FK209/Li-spiro
exhibiting the fastest decay. This can be attributed to the efficient
charge carrier transfer and high hole mobility induced by the chemical
p-doping of spiro-OMeTAD. Both the steady-state and time-resolved
PL decay results matched well with the above-mentioned characterization
results. There is no doubt that the FK209/Li-spiro-based PSCs exhibited
the highest Jsc, Voc, and FF values for all of the doped HTMs tested here, clearly
indicating the better hole-collection ability of co-doping of FK209
and LiTFSI into spiro-OMeTAD. The results show a definite effect of
chemical p-doing in improving the charge carrier transport/extraction
properties of the HTM, and we believe that the device efficiency can
be further increased by precisely controlling the doping ratios between
these p-dopants.

PL decay transient spectra monitored at 770 nm for MAPbI3–XClX thin
films with and without the spiro-OMeTAD layer prepared under different
doping conditions after excitation at 445 ± 10 nm.

Conclusions
Chemical p-doping of
organic HTMs has established widespread applications
as an effective functional modifier, represented by the most attractive
PSCs. In this work, we choose LiTFSI and two Co(III) oxidants FK102
and FK209 as the “redox active” p-type dopant models
to study the effect of different types of p-type doping on the charge-transport
properties at the perovskite/HTM interface and photovoltaic performance
of PSCs. It was observed that both Co(III) oxidants and LiTFSI doping
show positive effects on spiro-OMeTAD to generate radical cations
and improve its hole mobility. More strikingly, the combination of
FK209 and the ionic additive LiTFSI exhibits a superior hole-doping
ability, resulting in a greatly increased FF and PCE in PSCs. By incorporating
CH3NH3PbI3–XClX as the active layer, the PCE of the
device increased from 13.5% for FK209-spiro to 15% for Li-spiro and
17.8% for FK209/Li-spiro, with a synchronized enhancement in FF (74.1%), Jsc (21.7 mA/cm2), and Voc (1.11 V). SCLC, steady-state, and time-resolved PL
measurements have confirmed that with the coexistence of these p-type
dopants in a proper ratio the doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a high carrier
mobility (1.1 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1) and a more efficient charge carrier transfer/extraction
capability. In addition, the optical absorption results also indicated
that the introduction of Co(III) oxidants into Li-spiro can further
help to avoid significant reliance on light-induced doping of LiTFSI
in spiro-OMeTAD via a charge transfer interaction between FK209 (FK102)
and spiro-OMeTAD occurring even in the dark. This study sheds light
on the key correlation between the chemical doping and the resulting
changes in the charge-transport properties of HTMs and the subsequent
effects on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing a useful
avenue for the optimization of PSCs.

Solar Cell
Fabrication
F-doped SnO2 glass
substrates (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8, 8 Ω/sq) were patterned by
etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water. The
patterned FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication
in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and alcohol for 15 min each.
After drying with a N2 stream, UV–ozone was further
used to treat the substrates for 15 min. A thin compact TiO2 layer was deposited following the procedures in the literature:57 A 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
solution in 1-butanol was spin-coated onto FTO substrates at 4000
rpm for 40 s and annealed at 125 °C for 5 min; then, the similar
process was repeated twice with a 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
solution. The as-prepared film was sintered at 500 °C for 15
min. After cooling down to room temperature, the coated substrates
were immersed into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70
°C for 30 min and heat-treated at 500 °C for 15 min. Then,
the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox and
spin-coated with a PCBM solution (10 mg/mL in CB) at 6000 rpm for
40 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. To make a uniform
perovskite layer, a perovskite precursor solution consisting of 1.26
M PbI2, 0.14 M PbCl2, and 1.35 M MAI in the
cosolvent of DMSO/GBL (3:7 vol ratio) was stirred at 60 °C for
2 h and then deposited onto the PCBM layer at 1000 rpm for 20 s and
at 5000 rpm for 60 s. It is notable that 320 μL of anhydrous
toluene was injected onto the spinning film after 25 s at 5000 rpm.
Subsequently, the as-prepared substrates were annealed at 100 °C
for 15 min with the thickness of the perovskite layer of about 300
nm. Next, the HTM was spin-coated on the FTO/TiO2/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3–XClX substrate at 4000 rpm for 45 s using the prepared
HTM solutions. For dopant-free devices, a HTM solution containing
90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of CB was used. For the doped devices,
a Li-spiro solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD in CB
(90 mg/mL), into which 45 μL of LiTFSI/acetonitrile solution
(170 mg/mL) and 10 μL of tBP were added. The
FK102-spiro and FK209-spiro solutions were prepared by addition of
75 μL of Co(III) complex FK102/acetonitrile and FK209/acetonitrile
solutions (75 mM), respectively, into the spiro-OMeTAD/CB (90 mg/1
mL) solution.
For FK102/Li-spiro and FK209/Li-spiro solutions, the Li-spiro solution
was employed with a further addition of 75 μL of the FK102/acetonitrile
and FK209/acetonitrile solutions (75 mM), respectively. Before the
final thermal evaporation, all of the prepared HTM films were exposed
to a controlled environment with a relative humidity of 15% for 2
h to facilitate the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD. After that, a 100 nm
silver electrode was deposited through a shadow mask to create a device
area of 0.125 cm2.

Measurements and Characterization
All J–V curves were recorded
using a Keithley
2400 source meter unit under simulated AM 1.5G illumination at an
intensity of 100 mW/cm2 with a XES-70S1 solar simulator.
The system was calibrated using a NREL-certified monocrystal Si photodiode
detector before device testing. The incident photo-to-current conversion
efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a solar cell quantum
efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150; Zolix instrument. Co. Ltd).
All of the measurements were carried out in air at room temperature
without encapsulation, and the device performance
was measured with a well-defined area of 0.125 cm2.

The UV–visible absorption spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. The corresponding HTM solutions were
prepared with a similar procedure for the solutions used in device
fabrication, followed by dilution treatment. For example, for pristine-spiro-OMeTAD,
90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 mL of CB, then the solution
was diluted 104 times with CB to obtain the concentration
of 7.35 × 10–6 M. However, for Li-spiro, 45
μL of the 0.592 M LiTFSI/acetonitrile solution and 10 μL
of tBP were added into the spiro-OMeTAD matrix solution
(90 mg/mL in CB), which was then diluted 104 times with
CB to obtain the concentrations of 2.66 × 10–4 and 7.35 × 10–6 M for LiTFSI and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.
A similar dilution process was also performed for other HTM solutions
to obtain the concentration of 5.63 × 10–5 M
for FK102 or FK209. It is notable that all solutions were stored in
the dark prior to measurement. The absorption spectra in the solid
state were measured on the spin-coated films. The thin films were
prepared by spin-coating each HTM solution onto the glass substrates
at 4000 rpm for 45 s, followed by drying in a drier at room temperature
for 2 h. PL spectra were collected on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920
spectrofluorometer, and the excitation wavelength was 450 nm. Time-resolved
PL spectra were also performed on FLS920, which is synchronously equipped
with an EPL picosecond pulsed laser (445 ± 10 nm), and the emission
at 770 nm was monitored. SEM images were obtained on a JSM-7800F SEM.
The chemical states of Co were analyzed by XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi).
