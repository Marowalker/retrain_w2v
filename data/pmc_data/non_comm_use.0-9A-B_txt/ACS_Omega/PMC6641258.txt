Ultrafast charge-transfer (i.e.,
electron and hole) dynamics has
been investigated between the cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3, CPB) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and cadmium selenide (CdSe)
quantum dots (QDs) as a new composite material for photocatalytic
and photovoltaic applications. The CPB NCs have been synthesized and
characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The redox levels (i.e.,
conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB)) of the CPB NCs and CdSe
QDs suggest the feasibility of photoexcited electron transfer from
CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and photoexcited hole transfer from CdSe QDs to
CPB NCs, and it has been confirmed by both steady-state and time-resolved
spectroscopy. To investigate the electron- and hole-transfer dynamics
in ultrafast time scale, we have performed femtosecond up-conversion
and femtosecond transient absorption studies. The measured electron-transfer
time from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and hole-transfer time from CdSe QDs
to CPB NCs were found to be 550 and 750 fs, respectively. Interestingly,
the charge-transfer process found to be restricted in CPB/CdSe@CdS
core-shell system where electron transfer from CPB NCs to core shell
takes place, but the hole transfer from core shell to CPB NCs found
to be restricted due to CdS shell making the process thermodynamically
nonviable. Our observation has suggested that after the photoexcitation
of CPB NCs/CdSe QDs composite system, a charge-separated state is
formed where the electrons are localized in CB of CdSe QDs and holes
are localized in VB of CPB NCs. This makes the composite system a
better material for efficient light harvesting and photocatalytic
material as compared to the individual ones.

1 Introduction
Since
last decades,
one of the broad research interests on nanocrystal (NC) semiconductor
quantum dots (QDs) are due to their smart optical properties including
size tunable band gap, high exciton lifetime, high quantum yield (QY),
multiexciton generation, high photostability, easy synthesis protocol,
etc.1−7 These QDs are promising materials for the third-generation solar
cell, bioimaging, various photocatalytic and water-splitting devices,
etc.8−12 Since the last decade, among all of the QDs materials, metal chalcogen
QDs have been well studied in literature with regards to both fundamental
and application point of view.2−4,7 However,
very recently, one of the most important growing subject of quantum
dot research is organic–inorganic metal halide (MPbX3: M = CH3NH3, HC(NH3)2Cs; X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites.13−18 The perovskite materials have achieved maximum attention as solar
cell efficiency of CH3NH3PBI3 exceeded
20%.19,20 However, the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 is found to be a big issue due to its
sensitivity to moisture, which leads to hydrolysis and degradation
of the perovskite materials.21−26 So, it was utmost important to have a highly stable perovskite material
for all kinds of basic applications. Recently, Kovalenko and his team
have synthesized all inorganic lead halide (CsPbBr3, CPB)
quantum dots, which have a long-term stability.14 Yang et al. reported the different crystalline phase of
CsPbBr3 after varying the ratio of Cs and Pb.27 Interestingly, it has been observed that the
band gap of all of the inorganic perovskite materials can be tuned
from UV to visible by changing either the size or the composition.13,18,28,29 The size- and composition-dependent band gap tunability and carrier
dynamics for different kinds of all-inorganic perovskite materials
have been explored in literature.30−33 The tunable band gap in the UV
to visible region, narrow full width at half-maximum of the photoluminescence
(PL) spectra, very high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), reduced
luminescence blinking, and high carrier mobility (∼4500 cm2 V–1 s–1) make these perovskites
better alternative materials as compared to binary II–VI semiconductor
QDs for light-harvesting material.16,34−37 Therefore, the perovskite NCs can be efficiently used as gain medium
of the laser, light-emitting diodes, photon emitter, photodetector,
etc.35,37−42

Although it has been realized that all-inorganic perovskites
are
much superior materials in terms of stability, their power-conversion
efficiency is way poorer as compared to organic–inorganic metal
halide perovskite materials. Kulbak et al. reported ∼6.6% solar
efficiency inorganic-based cesium lead trihalide perovskite material.43 Recently, Swarnkar et al.44 reported a power-conversion efficiency of maximum 10.77%
for the quantum dot-induced phase stabilization of α-CsPbI3, which is the highest efficiency for all of the inorganic
perovskite materials so far. It has been realized that to get a higher
photovoltaic performance, the photogenerated hole has to be removed
very fast before it corrodes the photoanode. It is always a challenging
task to find suitable hole-transporting materials to stop the carrier
recombination. In addition, another important factor for a lower efficiency
of the all of the inorganic perovskites is limited absorption of solar
radiation (below 600 nm). Now to tackle the dual problem concept of co-sensitization
can be incorporated where with the perovskite material another II–VI
quantum dot material can be used. Due to suitable band energy level
alignment, a better charge separation can take place through interfacial
electron- and hole-transfer reactions. Synergistically, both perovskite
and II–VI QDs can behave as supersensitizer and absorb more
solar light as compared to individual material. Earlier, we have demonstrated
ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics between CPB NCs and dibromo fluorescence
(DBF) molecule where the photoexcited hole from CPB was extracted
by DBF and the photoexcited DBF injected an electron into the conduction
band (CB) of CPB, resulting grand charge separation.45 Earlier, we have also demonstrated the ultrafast charge-transfer
dynamics of II–VI quantum dots after sensitization with different
molecular adsorbates.46−48 However, till date, charge-transfer dynamics between
the perovskite NCs and II–VI QDs have never been discussed
in literature.

Herein, we are reporting the electron- and hole-transfer
dynamics
between photoexcited CsPbBr3 (CPB) perovskite nanocrystals
(NCs) and CdSe QDs by ultrafast time-resolved absorption and luminescence
spectroscopy. The synthesized CsPbBr3 (CPB) has been characterized
by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and steady-state optical studies. The redox band
alignment of CPB NCs49 and CdSe QDs50 suggests that the electron transfer from CB
of CPB NCs to CB of CdSe QD and hole transfer from valence band (VB)
of CdSe QDs to VB of CPB NCs can concomitantly take place. Selective
excitation through steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopic
studies confirm the above processes. To determine the electron- and
hole-transfer times in the above system, we carried out the femtosecond
upconversion with femtosecond transient absorption (TA) studies and
correlated the data. To reconfirm the above processes further, we
carried out ultrafast spectroscopic studies between CPB NCs and CdSe@CdS
core shell and the results have been discussed.

2 Results
and Discussion
To analyze the morphology of the synthesized
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, we carried out the HR-TEM and XRD
studies. Figure 1A
shows the HR-TEM
images of the synthesized CPB NCs. The size (edge length) of the cubic
NCs was measured to be 10 nm. The XRD pattern is shown in Figure 1B. Three major peaks
(2θ) at ∼15, 21.69, and 30.5° for [100], [110],
and [200] planes, respectively, reveal the cubic phase of CsPbBr3.14 To characterize the CPB NCs
optically, we have performed the steady-state absorption and luminescence
spectroscopic measurements. The first excitonic absorption of CPB
NCs appears at 472 nm, as seen in Figure 1C, and the corresponding band edge PL peak
appears at 487 nm, with a very high PLQY (∼85%, calculation
shown in the Supporting Information (SI)).

(olive solid line) and photoluminescence spectra (red dotted line)

The main endeavor of
the present study is to investigate the interfacial
electron- and hole-transfer dynamics of CPB NCs in the presence of
CdSe QDs and CdSe/CdS core-shell nanocrystals. A study of the ground-state
interaction is one of the key measurements for such charge-transfer
reactions. To examine the interaction between the CPB NCs and CdSe
QDs, we have carried out the steady-state optical absorption and PL
studies. Figure 2A-a–c
shows the steady-state optical absorption spectra of CPB NCs, CdSe
QDs, and colloidal mixture of CPB NCs and CdSe QDs, respectively,
in toluene. We maintained the concentration ratio of CPB and CdSe
QDs ∼1:1 (calculation is shown in the SI) to perform all of the optical studies. The absorption peaks at
472 nm for CPB NCs and at 555 nm for CdSe QDs are almost unchanged
in the CPB/CdSe QDs mixture. The spectrum (d) shows the simple addition
of (a) and (b), which is not very different from the spectrum (c)
except in the blue region of the spectrum. A higher absorption in
the blue region of the spectrum suggests that there might be interaction
in the high-energy states of both CdSe QD and CPB NCs. Figure 2B-a shows the steady-state
PL spectrum of CPB NCs with peak maxima at 487 nm having ∼85%
PLQY in toluene. On the other hand, the band edge emission peak maxima
of the CdSe QDs appear at 570 nm (Figure 2B-trace b), with PLQY ∼23% in toluene
(calculation shown in SI). Figure 2B-trace c shows that on the
addition to CPB and CdSe QDs, the emission intensity of CPB at 487
nm gets drastically reduced and disappeared at the CdSe QDs position
(570 nm). The energetics of CPB and CdSe QDs drawn in Scheme 1 suggest that the conduction
band (CB) and valence band (VB) maxima of the CPB NCs lie energetically
higher and lower than the CB and VB of CdSe QDs, respectively.49,50 Therefore, upon photoexcitation at 400 nm light, both CdSe QDs and
CPB can be excited, where photoexcited electron can be transferred
from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and photoexcited hole from CdSe QDs can be
transferred to CPB, as both the processes are thermodynamically feasible.
Now to determine the time scale of both electron- and hole-transfer
processes, time-resolved upconversion measurements have been carried
out for both CdSe QDs and CPB NCs at their PL maxima position both
in absence and presence of each other after exciting them at 400 nm
laser light, as shown in Figure 2C,D. Figure 2C-a′ shows the upconversion decay trace of CPB measured
at the wavelength of 487 nm and can be fitted multiexponentially with
time components of τ1 = 5 (±0.2) ps (29%), τ2 = 60 (±2) ps (21%), and τ3 = >100
ps
(50%) (Table 1, SI). Interestingly, the
decay components become faster in the presence of CdSe QDs (Figure 2C-c′), which
can be fitted with time components of τ1 = 0.55 (±0.1)
ps (47%), τ2 = 2 (±0.25) ps (27%), τ3 = 30 (±1) ps (17%), and τ4 = >100
ps
(9%) (Table 1, SI). The extremely fast
component (550 fs) in the decay trace can be attributed to the electron
transfer from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs as the process is energetically
viable (Scheme 1).51,52 The PL decay trace of CdSe QDs measured at 570 nm is shown in Figure 2C-b′ and has
been fitted multiexponentially with time constants of τ1 = 4 (±0.2) ps (24%), τ2 = 60 (±2)
ps (23%), and τ3 = >100 ps (53%) (Table 1, SI). Interestingly, this decay kinetics
becomes faster
when CdSe QDs interacts with CPB NCs, as illustrated in Figure 2D-c″, which can be fitted
multiexponentially with time constants of τ1 = 0.6
(±0.1) ps (29%), τ2 = 1.5 (±0.20) ps (30%),
τ3 = 20 (±1) ps (23%), and τ4 = >100 ps (18%) (Table 1, SI). Herein,
the faster decay component (600 fs) can be attributed to the hole-transfer
time from CdSe QDs to CPB NCs.48

Scheme 1 Schematic49,50 Representation of Electron Transfer
from CB of CPB NC to CdSe QD and Hole Transfer from VB of CdSe QD
to CPB NC
For a better understanding
of this charge-transfer process in two
different nanocrystals interface, we impose the band edge engineering
concept. Therefore, we have deliberately carried out the charge-transfer
interaction between CPB NCs and CdSe@CdS core shell, where core is
CdSe QD. The steady-state optical absorption spectra of CPB NCs, CdSe@CdS
core shell, and the mixture of these two are shown in Figure 3A-a–c, respectively.
The absorption spectrum of the mixture (c) is not changed from pure
CPB NCs or CdSe@CdS core shell, which signifies that there is no complexation
between these NCs like CdSe QDs. Unlike CdSe, the steady-state PL
spectrum of the mixture of CPB NCs and CdSe@CdS core shell is different. Figure 3B-a,b depicts the
PL spectra of CPB NCs and CdSe/CdS core shell, respectively, after
400 nm excitation. Figure 3B-c shows the PL spectrum of colloidal mixture of CPB and
CdSe@CdS core shell. Similar to CdSe QDs (Figure 2B-c′), the PL spectrum of the mixture
of CPB-CdSe@CdS core shell shows that the PL of CPB NCs is drastically
quenched. However, the PL of CdSe@CdS core shell has not been quenched
in the presence of CPB NCs, which is different from CdSe QDs. To realize
the distinct charge (electron and hole) transfer processes, we have
drawn the energetics of CPB and CdSe@CdS core shell in Scheme 2.49,53−55 The band energy alignment of the CdSe@CdS core shell
suggests a quasi–type II structure in which valence bands of
CdSe QD and CdS QD have a higher energy offset.56,57 Again, Scheme 2 suggests
that the CB and VB of the CPB NCs lie energetically higher than the
CB and VB of the CdSe@CdS core shell. Thus, upon photoexcitation,
the photoexcitation of electron from CPB NC to CdSe@CdS core shell
can take place, as the process is energetically favorable. However,
photoexcited hole transfer from CdSe@CdS core shell to CPB NC is restricted
due to the presence of CdS shell, which makes the process energetically
unfavorable. In the case of CPB and CdSe QDs mixture, we have seen
that the PL quenching of both CPB and CdSe QDs is due to electron
transfer from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and hole transfer from CdSe QDs
to CPB NCs, respectively. Herein, the PL quenching of CPB NCs in the
presence of CdSe@CdS core shell can be attributed as electron transfer
from CPB NC to core shell. However, the PL intensity of the CdSe@CdS
core shell decreases marginally in the presence of CPB, suggesting
that the hole transfer is restricted from core shell to CPB NCs. The
hole is confined in the core CdSe due to large VB offset energy core
CdSe QD and shell CdS QD (Scheme 2). Although the hole-transfer process is not thermodynamically
viable, we have observed a marginal PL quenching of the CdSe@CdS core
shell, which can be attributed to the leaking of hole from the CdSe
core of the core shell to CPB NC through CdS shell QD.

Scheme 2 Allowed Electron-Transfer and Restricted Hole-Transfer Processes
from CPB NC to CdSe/CdS Core Shell and CdSe/CdS Core Shell to CPB
NC, respectively49,53−55
To reconfirm the electron transfer from CPB
to CdSe@CdS core shell
and the restriction of hole transfer from core shell to CPB and to
determine the time constants of charge-transfer processes, we have
carried out femtosecond upconversion luminescence studies after exciting
the samples at 400 nm. Figure 3C-a′ is the luminescence decay trace of CPB NCs at
487 nm, which we have already mentioned earlier (Figure 2C-a′) and has been fitted
biexponentially (Table 1, SI). Interestingly,
in the presence of CdSe@CdS core shell, the CPB PL decay is much faster,
as shown in Figure 3C-c′, and can be fitted biexponentially with time constants
of τ1 = 0.65 (±0.1) ps (64%) and τ2 = 15 (±0.75) ps (33%) (Table 2, SI). This faster component of the decay can be attributed to
the electron transfer from CPB NC to CdSe@CdS core shell. On the other
hand, the PL decay kinetics of CdSe@CdS core shell in the absence
and presence of CPB NCs at 600 nm have been shown in Figure 3D-b′,c″, respectively.
It is seen that the emission decay kinetics of the CdSe@CdS core shell
are not changed significantly in the absence and presence of CPB NCs.
The PL decay trace of CdSe@CdS core shell can be fitted multiexponentially
with time constants of τ1 = 10 (±0.5) ps (21%),
τ2 = 50 (±2) ps (31%), τ3 =
150 (±5) ps (3%), and τ4 = >1 ns (45%) in
the
absence of CPB NCs (Table 2, SI) and τ1 = 7 (±0.5) ps (33%), τ2 = 25 (±2)
ps (25%), τ3 = 130 (±5) ps (7%), and τ4 = >1 ns (35%) in the presence of CPB NCs (Table 2, SI). The faster and longer components
represent the
trap state and the exciton recombination, respectively.58,59 However, little change in decay dynamics might be due to leaking
of hole from the core of the CdSe QDs to the CPB NCs through the CdS
shell. Therefore, in the present investigation, it has been observed
that both electron and hole transfer take place simultaneously in
the CPB and CdSe QDs system; however, in the case of CPB and CdSe@CdS
core-shell system, electron transfer from photoexcited CPB NCs to
core shell is facile, but the hole transfer from photoexcited CdSe@CdS
core shell to CPB NCs is restricted. From a steady-state and time-resolved
PL studies, it is confirmed that the electron transfer takes place
from photoexcited CPB NCs to CdSe QDs and the hole is transferred
from photoexcited CdSe QDs to CPB NCs. At this point, we would like
to mention that it is important to find out the viability of energy
transfer between CPB NCs and CdSe QDs and CdSe@CdS core shell as the
PL
spectra of CPB NCs nicely overlap with the absorption spectra of the
QD materials. Therefore, the energy transfer from photoexcited CPB
NCs to the QD materials is expected. However, in the steady-state
PL spectra in both systems, we did not observe any increment in QD
PL. So energy-transfer process in the above-mentioned systems can
be ruled out.

To reconfirm the electron- and hole-transfer dynamics
between CPB
NCs and CdSe QDs more precisely, femtosecond transient absorption
spectroscopic studies have been carried out and correlated the electron-
and hole-transfer dynamics with fluorescence upconversion data. Figure 4a shows the TA spectra
of CPB after 400 nm laser excitation at different time delays. We
used very low pump intensity to minimize the multiexciton generation
and pump fluency is calculated in the SI. The spectra at all of the time delays show a sharp negative absorption
change (bleach) peaking at 477 nm, which can be attributed to the
ground state excitonic absorption, which nicely matches with the steady
state absorption spectrum (Figure 1A-a). In addition, the bleach photoinduced absorption
(PA) was observed at 485–530 nm, which can be attributed to
hot exciton induced absorption.30 The TA
spectra of CdSe QDs consisting of two negative absorption bands (bleach)
at 555 and 480 nm due to 1S and 1P electronic transition, respectively,
are shown in Figure 4b. A weak photoinduced absorption band in the red region of the spectra
suggests the presence of minimum-defect states in CdSe QDs. Similar
to the steady-state optical absorption spectrum, the TA spectra of
the CPB NCs and CdSe QDs mixture show individual spectral feature,
which has been illustrated in Figure 4c. Herein, one negative absorption band appearing at
555 nm can be attributed to 1S excitonic bleach of CdSe QDs, whereas
the second one, which is quite broad, can be attributed to the combination
of excitonic bleach of CPB NCs and 1P excitonic bleach of CdSe QDs,
where primarily the bleach is dominated by CPB NCs. It is interesting
to see that the photoinduced absorption beyond 600 nm is very low
for CPB NCs and CdSe QDs, attributed to the minimum-defect states
in our materials. But this photoinduced absorption beyond 600 nm is
increased in the composite system (shown in Figure 2, SI) compared to the isolated CPB NCs and CdSe QDs, which
reveal an increase in the carrier density at the CdSe QDs transferred
from CPB NCs.46,60

Figure 4 TA spectra of (a) CPB NCs, (b) CdSe QDs,
and (c) mixture of CPB
NCs and CdSe QDs at different time delays after 400 nm pulse excitation
in toluene.

To monitor the electron-
and hole-transfer dynamics between CPB
NCs and CdSe QDs, we probed the bleach kinetics at the key wavelengths
in different systems. Figure 5A-a represents the bleach kinetics of pure CPB NCs at 477
nm. The growth of the bleach kinetics can be fitted biexponentially
with time constants of τ1 = 150 (±7.5) fs (70%)
and τ2 = 1 (±0.1) ps (30%) (Table 3, SI), which can be attributed to the carrier cooling
time from upper excitonic states to the band edge states of CPB NCs.51,61 Now, the bleach recovery kinetics can be fitted with time components
of 5 (±0.25) ps (−26%), 70 (±3) ps (−35%),
and >1 ns (−37%) (Table 3, SI),
which can be attributed to the charge recombination dynamics between
photoexcited electron and hole in CPB NCs. The bleach recovery kinetics
matches nicely with the upconversion PL decay (Figure 7, SI). This observation suggests that majority of
the charge carriers recombine through radiative process, which makes
them a high-QY material.62 Now, it has
been observed that bleach recovery kinetics at 477 nm drastically
change in the CPB/CdSe QD system, as shown in Figure 5A-b, where the bleach growth time is found
to be pulse-width limited (<100 fs) (Table 3, SI). This pulse-width-limited bleach growth indicates electron
transfer from the photoexcited hot states of CPB NCs to CdSe QDs before
cooling to the band edge states. Now, the bleach recovery kinetics
can be fitted multiexponentially with time constants τ1 = 0.65 (±0.1) ps (−42%), τ2 = 10 (±0.5)
ps (−30%), τ3 = 150 (±5) ps (−10%),
and τ4 = >1 ns (−18%) (Table 3, SI). The bleach recovery found to be much faster
in the CPB/CdSe QD system as compared to pure CPB NCs is attributed
to the fast electron transfer from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs.51,62 Herein, the 0.65 ps component represents the electron-transfer time
from CPB NCs to CdSe QDs, which closely matches with the electron-transfer
time constants determined from the fluorescence upconversion data.
Now, the transient bleach recovery kinetics for CdSe QDs and CPB/CdSe
QDs system were monitored at 555 nm, which is the first excitonic
bleach peak for CdSe QDs, and are shown in Figure 5B. Figure 5B-c indicates the first excitonic bleach recovery kinetics
of CdSe QDs that can be fitted with biexponential growth constants
of 100 (±10) fs (75%) and 0.5 (±0.05) ps (25%) (Table 3, SI), where the longer growth component
can be attributed to the electron cooling time from upper electronic
states to the band edge states.58,59 Now, the 1S bleach
recovery can be fitted multiexponentially with time constants of τ1 = 6 (±0.25) ps (−35%), τ2 =
100 (±5) ps (−21%), and τ3 = >1 ns
(−44%)
(Table 3, SI). The faster (6 ps) and longer
(100 ps and > 1 ns) time components represent the carrier recombination
due to trapping and exciton recombination, respectively.58,59 Now, Figure 5B-d
indicates the first excitonic bleach recovery kinetics of CdSe QDs
in the presence of CPB NCs that can be fitted with biexponential growth
constants of 150 (±10) fs (75%) and 0.4 (±0.05) ps (25%)
and multiexponential recovery components with time constants of τ1 = 5 (±0.2) ps (−23%), τ2 = 22
(±1.5) ps (−34%), τ3 = 130 (±5)
ps (−12%), and τ3 = >1 ns (−31%)
(Table 3, SI). It is interesting to see
that the
growth component of CdSe QDs at the excitonic wavelength in the presence
of CPB NCs does not change (Figure 5B-d), revealing that electron in CdSe QDs is not affected
in the presence of CPB NCs. However, the bleach recovery found to
be little faster as compared to pure CdSe QDs might be due to the
hole transfer from CdSe QDs to CPB NCs.

To investigate the charge-transfer
dynamics in the CdSe@CdS core
shell in the presence of CPB NCs in ultrafast time scale, femtosecond
transient absorption studies have been carried out for pure CdSe@CdS
core shell and CdSe@CdS/CPB NCs systems and are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure 6, SI). To follow
the charge-transfer dynamics in the CdSe@CdS/CPB NCs composite system,
we have monitored the bleach recovery kinetics at different excitonic
wavelengths (477 and 590 nm) and compared them with the bleach recovery
kinetics in the pure CdSe@CdS QDs and CPB NCs, respectively, and shown
in Figure 6. Figure 6a,b shows the bleach
kinetics of CPB NCs at 477 nm in the absence and presence of CdSe@CdS
core shell. The bleach dynamics of pure CPB NCs has already been discussed
in the earlier part of this article. It is interesting to see that
the bleach kinetics of CPB NCs at 477 nm drastically changes in the
presence of CdSe@CdS core shell, which can be fitted with pulse-width-limited
growth (<100 fs) and multiexponential recovery with time constants
of τ1 = 0.45 (±0.05) ps (−37%), τ2 = 5 (±0.35) ps (−41%), τ3 =
30 (±3) ps (−15%), and τ4 = >1 ns
(−7%)
(Table 4, SI). Pulse-width-limited bleach
growth kinetics clearly suggest the transfer of hot electrons from
CPB NCs to the core shell. However, it is quite interesting to see
that bleach recovery kinetics at 590 nm looks marginally different
in the case of pure CdSe@CdS core shell and CPB/CdSe@CdS core shell
system. This observation clearly indicates that hole transfer from
the core shell to CPB NCs is restricted and quite matches with the
fluorescence upconversion data.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the interfacial charge
(both electron and hole) transfer
between photoexcited CsPbBr3 (CPB) NCs and CdSe QDs and
CdSe@CdS core shell has been demonstrated through steady-state and
ultrafast time-resolved PL and absorption techniques. To start with,
both CPB NCs and QD core shells were synthesized and characterized
by HR-TEM and XRD measurement techniques. The energy-level diagram
suggests that the electron transfer from the photoexcited CPB NCs
to CdSe QDs and the hole transfer from CdSe QDs to CPB NCs are thermodynamically
viable processes. Both the steady-state and time-resolved PL studies
suggest the concurrent electron and hole transfers from CPB NCs to
CdSe QDs and from CdSe QDs to CPB NCs, respectively. On the other
hand, in case of CPB NCs and CdSe@CdS core-shell system, the photoexcited
electron transfer from CPB NC to the core shell is found to be facile,
whereas the hole transfer from core shell to CPB NCs is found to be
restricted due to the presence of CdS shell. To monitor the charge-transfer
dynamics in an ultrafast time scale, two complimentary techniques,
femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion techniques,
were employed. The photoexcited electron-transfer times from CPB NCs
to CdSe QDs and CdSe@CdS core shell were measured to be 550 and 650
fs, respectively. On the other hand, the hole-transfer time from the
photoexcited CdSe QDs to CPB NCs is found to be 750 fs. The present
investigation suggests that in CPB NCs and CdSe QDs composite system,
a grand charge separation, where all of the electrons are localized
to CdSe QDs and the holes are localized in CPB NCs, takes place on
photoexcitation. These charge-separated composites can be used as
efficient materials for photocatalysis and photovoltaic applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Cesium
carbonate (Cs2CO3), lead bromide (PbBr2), cadmium
oxide (CdO, 99.5%), selenium powder (Se, 99.99%), sulfur powder (S,
99.99%), octadecene (ODE, 90%), trioctyl phosphine (TOP, 90%), oleic
acid (OA, 90%), and oleylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used without further purification. tert-Butanol (tBuOH) (AR grade) was used to purify the crude
product and toluene was used to disperse the purified samples.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs
The colloidal CPB QDs has been synthesized after
following the method
by Kovalenko and his co-workers.14 To synthesize
the CPB QDs, first we made the Cs-oleate stock solution. In the three-neck
round-bottom (RB) flask, 1.25 mmol (∼0.41 g) Cs2CO3 was taken along with 20 mL ODE and 4 mmol OA (∼1
mL). To dry this precursor, it was heated at 130 °C for 1 h then
further heated to 150 °C for the complete dissolution of Cs2CO3. The resulting solution formed Cs-oleate and
was used as Cs precursor. In another three-neck RB flask, 0.188 mmol
PbBr2 (∼0.069 g) and 5 mL ODE were taken and heated
to 120 °C in vacuum for 1 h to dry the solution completely. After
complete drying, the mixture was heated to 180 °C and 0.4 mL
Cs-oleate was injected at that temperature. Finally, the reaction
was quenched in ice bath within 1 min after the injection of Cs precursor.
The synthesized CPB was cleaned by precipitation in tertiary butanol
and dissolved in toluene for further use.

4.3 Synthesis of CdSe QDs and CdSe@CdS Core Shell
We have
followed the high-temperature synthesis method reported
by Peng and his co-workers to synthesize the monodisperse CdSe QDs.63 In brief, first Se stock solution was prepared
by dissolving 0.5 mmol Se in 1 mL TOP by ultrasonication. CdO (1 mmol)
and OA (4 mmol) were taken in a three-neck RB flask along with 15
mL ODE and heated to 250 °C in an inert atmosphere for the complete
dissolution, suggesting the formation of Cd-oleate. Then, the reaction
mixture was heated to 280 °C and the Se stock solution injected
in a single shot at that temperature. To get the desired size of CdSe
QDs, the reacting solution was left at 280 °C for few minutes
and then cooled down to room temperature. The synthesized CdSe QDs
were cleaned by precipitation in methanol two to three times and dissolved
in toluene for further studies.

The CdSe/CdS core shell was
synthesized after following the method reported by Peng et al.64 To synthesize the core shell, the newly synthesized
CdSe core was used as the seed. First, Cd-oleate was prepared by refluxing
the mixture of 54 mg of CdO, 800 μL of OA, and 200 μL
TOP in 10 mL ODE at 180 °C in inert Ar gas atmosphere into a
three-neck round-bottom flask. Then, the mixture was cooled down to
room temperature. 12.5 mL of synthesized CdSe QDs was added into the
Cd-oleate and heated to 120 °C for 25 min to completely remove
toluene. After that, this mixture was heated to 200 °C. Meanwhile,
the S solution was made by dissolving 13.4 mg of S powder in 200 μL
of TOP in 5 mL of ODE. This S solution was added dropwise into the
reaction mixture at 200 °C for 1 h and left for 30 min for complete
growth of the CdS shell. Then, the final mixture was cooled down to
room temperature and precipitated by methanol and dissolved in toluene
for further use.
