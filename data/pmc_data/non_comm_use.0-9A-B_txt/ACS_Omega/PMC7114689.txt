To
improve the oil displacement effect of polymer solutions in
heterogeneous oil layers and increase the energy utilization rate,
Daqing Oilfield proposes a partial pressure tool to control the polymer
solution injection amount in high-permeability oil layers and increase
the injection amount in low-permeability oil layers to enhance the
total oil recovery. To study the effect of the partial pressure tool
on enhancing oil recovery and the action mechanism of the tool on
polymer molecules in high-permeability reservoirs, core displacement
experiments were performed to study the effects of various factors
on oil recovery. Microscopic experiments were then carried out to
study the differences in molecular morphology and molecular coil size
of the microscopic polymer solution before and after the action of
the partial pressure tool. The experimental results show that the
partial pressure tool increased the oil recovery by 4.4% and that
the throttling pressure difference was directly proportional to the
oil recovery. The partial pressure tool subjected the polymer solution
to shear deformation and reduced the molecular coil size. When the
concentration of the solution was changed, the degree of change in
the molecular structure and the coil size was small, and the influence
on the oil displacement effect was minimal. This experiment is of
great significance for improving the energy utilization rate.

1 Introduction
Oil fields that have been exploited for a long time enter the high
water cut stage.1−3 This stage is characterized by high water cut and
low energy utilization caused by reservoir heterogeneity and an unfavorable
mobility ratio. However, there is still a large amount of residual
oil left in the formation after conventional oil displacement.4−6 To ensure stable production and to improve the energy utilization
rate, polymer flooding is increasingly employed to enhance oil recovery
in various oil fields.7−11 The oil reservoirs are usually heterogeneous. When polymer flooding
is carried out in high-permeability oil layers, the polymer solution
has strong injection capacity, large injection volume, and good flooding
effect. In contrast, in low-permeability layers, the injected solution
has poor matching to the reservoir and hence low injection volume
and poor flooding effect.12−101 In order to improve the oil displacement effect, a partial pressure
tool is proposed for use in high-permeability oil layers. The tool
increases the polymer injection amount in low-permeability oil layers
and enhances the total oil recovery without affecting the oil displacement
effect of the polymer solution in the high-permeability oil layers.

To date, improvements have been made to traditional polymer flooding
to enhance oil recovery. Technical processes for surfactant/polymer
flooding and alkali/surfactant/polymer flooding have been put forward,
and the synergistic effect of various chemicals has been used to improve
the flooding effect.15−18 Some researchers have also developed new polymers to improve the
oil displacement effect.19,20 However, these technologies
cannot solve the issue of reservoir heterogeneity.21 Although they can greatly enhance the oil recovery from
high-permeability reservoirs, they cannot enhance the oil recovery
from low-permeability reservoirs. The total oil recovery is still
low. Therefore, some researchers have investigated the improvement
of oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. Currently, profile control
in high-permeability reservoirs is the most effective method to enhance
the low oil recovery caused by reservoir heterogeneity. Liu et al.22 studied the new profile control agent of dispersed
particle gel (DPG) and conducted a parallel sand layer filling test
and a microscopic visualization test. The experimental results show
that DPG particles can block the high-permeability layer by gathering
in the large pore throats or directly blocking small pore throats
and hence improve the sweep efficiency and oil recovery and realize
deep profile control.22 Yao et al.23 studied pore-scale elastic microspheres as a
new profile control agent and carried out displacement experiments.
The results show that the elastic microspheres are more likely to
block the high-permeability layer. The elastic microspheres block
water and oil and can improve the sweep condition and oil displacement
effect in the high-permeability, medium-low-permeability, and low-permeability
layers.23 Liu et al.24 studied asphalt particle gel (GAP) as a new composite profile
control system and conducted core displacement experiments. Laboratory
core displacement experiment results show a good injectivity of the
GAP solution in the high-permeability zone with a high plugging rate.
Parallel core displacement experiment results demonstrate a longer
response time and enhanced oil recovery for GAP compared to polymer
gels in fractured systems.24 Lu et al.25 studied the factors affecting the production
increase by depth profile control agents and their reservoir adaptability
by core displacement experiments. The results show that the dosage,
strength, and permeability coefficient of the oil displacement agent
all affect the profile control stimulation effect, which improves
with larger injection volumes.25 The oil
recovery initially increases with agent concentration and then decreases
as the agent concentration is increased further. Shi et al.26 studied self-aggregated divinylbenzene-co-acrylamide
(DCA) microspheres as a new profile control agent and the influence
of different ratio factors on oil recovery through core displacement
experiments. The results show that the oil recovery enhancement is
the highest when DCA microspheres with the optimal matching factor
are injected. Additionally, the oil saturation distribution demonstrates
that these DCA microspheres can enhance the sweep efficiency by plugging
high-permeability water channels.26

Although profile control can obviously enhance the oil recovery
from heterogeneous reservoirs, the injected profile control agent
will block the high-permeability reservoirs after profile control
is performed.27 In addition, some profile
control agents will enter the low-permeability reservoirs and remain
in the matrix, thus polluting the low-permeability reservoirs.28 Therefore, an oil displacement method that neither
pollutes the formation nor changes its structure to improve the heterogeneity
of the oil layer is highly significant. To address these requirements,
Daqing Oilfield has put forward a concept of oil displacement by layered
injection.29 In layered injection, a partial
pressure tool is used to control the injection amount in high-permeability
oil layers to increase the displacement agent injection amount in
low-permeability oil layers and improve the total oil recovery. Corresponding
research has been carried out in order to study the effectiveness
of the partial pressure tool in enhancing oil recovery. Huang et al.
established the physical model of the partial pressure tool and the
rheological equation of the polymer solution in the tool using force
balance analysis and then analyzed the influence of the partial pressure
tool structural parameters on the rheological properties of the polymer
solution.30 Huang et al.31 studied the flow characteristics of the polymer solution
in the partial pressure tool by finite element analysis and verified
the results of the numerical simulation through laboratory experiments.
The optimal structural parameters of the partial pressure tool were
obtained from the experiments. At a flow rate of 10 m3/day,
the partial pressure tool achieved a pressure drop of 6.08 ×
105 Pa in the polymer solution and a viscosity loss rate
of 6.69%.31 Although the flow characteristics
of the polymer solution in the partial pressure tool have been studied
in the works above, the flow characteristics were only studied from
the perspective of theoretical formulae and numerical simulations.
Experimental proof of the oil recovery enhancement by the partial
pressure tool and the effect of the tool on the polymer solution molecules
is still lacking.

In this paper, an experimental model of layered
injection was established
based on the partial pressure tool. Polymer solutions with different
molecular weights and concentrations and cores with different permeability
ranges were selected for displacement experiments to study the effect
of the partial pressure tool on enhancing oil recovery. The relationships
between throttling pressure difference, polymer solution concentration,
polymer molecular weight, and the oil recovery by the polymer solution
flowing through the partial pressure tool were also studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Partial Pressure
Tool on Oil
Recovery
Heterogeneous cores with a permeability ratio of
3 were selected for displacement experiments under the condition of
low injection volume (10 m3/day) to obtain the polymer
solution total oil recovery and throttling pressure. The experiments
were performed using polymer solutions with different molecular weights
and concentrations with and without the action of the partial pressure
tool. The results are shown in Table 1. The oil recovery and throttling pressure difference
of each core before and after the polymer solution passed through
the partial pressure tool under different permeability ratios were
also obtained and shown in Figure 7.

2500	36.9	39.3	1.13	
2500	2000	37.8	42.2	1.21	
As shown in Table 1, under the condition
of low injection volume, the total oil recovery
of heterogeneous cores increased after the action of the partial pressure
tool. The oil recovery both before and after the action of the partial
pressure tool increased with the polymer solution molecular weight.
This is because increasing the molecular weight increased the effective
volume of the molecules in the solution. The molecular chains were
then more likely to entangle, forming firmer-networked entanglement
points. Macroscopically, the viscosity was also higher, resulting
in an increase in the oil displacement efficiency of the solution
in the core pore channels.32,33 For a given polymer
molecular weight, the oil recovery both before and after the action
of the partial pressure tool increased with the polymer solution concentration.
This is because a higher solution concentration corresponds to an
increased density of the polymer molecules. The denser arrangement
of polymer molecules tightened the total network structure and led
to a higher viscosity and hence a better oil displacement effect in
the pores.34,35

Due to the throttling effect
of the partial pressure tool, the
injection amount of the polymer solution in the high-permeability
cores was controlled, and the injection amount in the low-permeability
cores was increased, thus improving both the oil displacement efficiency
and the total oil recovery. Increasing the polymer solution molecular
weight and concentration increased the throttling pressure difference
of the polymer solution flowing through the partial pressure tool.
This shows that the higher the molecular weight and concentration
of the solution, the better are the throttling effect of the partial
pressure tool and the control on the injection amount of the polymer
solution in high-permeability reservoirs. This is consistent with
the increased oil recovery.

The partial pressure tool increased
the total oil recovery improvement
by 21.3 and 27.5% when the molecular weight and concentration of the
polymer solution were changed, respectively. Therefore, changing the
concentration of the displacement agent has a more significant effect
on enhancing oil recovery when the partial pressure tool is used to
improve the oil displacement effect in heterogeneous reservoirs.

Figure 1 shows the
results of the displacement experiment when the permeability ratios
of the heterogeneous cores were varied at the low injection volume
of 10 m3/day, and the polymer solution with a molecular
weight of 1900 × 104 and concentration of 2000 mg/L
was used.

Figure 1 Influence of partial pressure tool on oil recovery and throttling
pressure difference: (a) influence of partial pressure tool on oil
recovery with different permeabilities, (b) influence of partial pressure
tool on throttling pressure difference with different permeabilities,
and (c) influence of partial pressure tool on total oil recovery with
different permeabilities.

It can be seen from Figure 1a that with the increase of the permeability ratio, the oil
recovery from the high-permeability core before the action of the
partial pressure tool increased, while the oil recovery from the low-permeability
core decreased. This is because in the displacement process, before
the partial pressure tool was installed, the polymer solution had
a strong injection capacity and a large injection amount in the high-permeability
core, which led to a better oil displacement effect from the polymer
solution. There was a large reduction in the amount of the polymer
solution injected in the low-permeability core, which had a poor oil
displacement effect. Moreover, with the increase of permeability ratio,
more polymer solution was injected into the high-permeability core
and less polymer solution was injected into the low-permeability core,
resulting in increased polymer solution oil recovery in the high-permeability
core and decreased oil recovery in the low-permeability core.

With the same permeability ratio, the polymer solution oil recovery
in the high-permeability cores decreased and that in the low-permeability
core increased after the action of the partial pressure tool. This
is because the injection amount of the polymer solution into the high-permeability
core was restricted by the partial pressure tool, which produced a
shear effect on the polymer solution.30,31 The shear
effect changed the properties of the polymer solution, affected the
oil displacement effect, and led to a slight decrease in oil recovery.
However, the partial pressure tool increased the polymer solution
injected into the low-permeability core, enhancing the oil displacement
effect and polymer solution oil recovery. As the permeability ratio
increased, the throttling effect of the partial pressure tool increased.
The throttling pressure difference increased to a maximum of 1.21
MPa, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, in the high-permeability core, the stronger the control
effect of the partial pressure tool on the polymer solution, the more
obvious was the effect on the polymer molecules. This resulted in
a slight increase in the degree of oil recovery reduction. An increase
in the polymer solution injected into the low-permeability core resulted
in a substantial increase in the polymer solution oil recovery.

The increase of oil recovery in the low-permeability core after
the action of the partial pressure tool was larger than the decrease
of oil recovery in the high-permeability core, which led to an increase
in the total oil recovery. The increase is consistent with Figure 1c. The total oil
recovery increased with the permeability ratio, with a maximum increase
of 4.5%. Therefore, the oil recovery enhancement of the partial pressure
tool increases with the reservoir heterogeneity.

2.2 Influence of the Partial Pressure Tool on
the Molecules of the Polymer Solution
Although the partial
pressure tool will greatly enhance the polymer solution oil recovery
of the polymer solution in low-permeability cores, it will also lead
to a slight decrease in the oil recovery in high-permeability cores.
This is because when the partial pressure tool is used to control
the injection amount of the polymer solution in high-permeability
cores, the partial tool will also affect the polymer solution during
the injection process by changing the molecular structure of the polymer
solution. This affects the oil displacement effect of the polymer
solution in high-permeability cores, resulting in the reduction of
oil recovery. The influence of the polymer solution concentration
and molecular weight on the effect of the partial pressure tool is
highly significant, and should be studied from the microscopic aspect.
To further understand the effect of the partial pressure tool on the
polymer solution molecules in the process of high-permeability core
flooding, the microstructure and molecular coils of polymer molecules
before and after the action of the partial pressure tool were analyzed.

2.2.1 Influence of the Partial Pressure Tool on
the Molecular Microstructure of the Polymer Solution
Cores
with a very permeability ratio of 3 and polymer solutions with different
concentrations and molecular weights were selected for the displacement
experiment at the low injection amount of 10 m3/day. When
the experiment has stabilized, the polymer solution before and after
the action of the partial pressure tool was sampled and observed by
SEM. The results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Polymer molecules form a continuous spatial network structure in
the solution and have a certain fractal growth self-similarity. This
is mainly due to the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent carboxyl
groups on the macromolecular chains after the partial hydrolysis of
polyacrylamide, which enhances the stretching of the polymer molecular
chains. Different polymer molecular chains can penetrate one another
and even intertwine, resulting in the formation of high-density multi-layer
three-dimensional network structures with holes of different sizes
in the solution and the emergence of coarse trunk and subdivision
branches. This network structure can adsorb and enwrap large numbers
of water molecules to generate deformation resistance, resulting in
the good adhesion enhancement capability of the partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamide solution. Further analysis shows that the relative
molecular mass of the polymer has an influence on the structure of
the molecular aggregation state. Increasing the relative molecular
mass lengthens the molecule chains and hence decreases the number
of molecular chains contained per unit volume, the intermolecular
force, and the density of the molecular space network structure. Increasing
the concentration of the solution increases the number of molecules
per unit volume of the polymer solution, the entanglement degree and
width of the molecular chains, and the tightness of the grid structure.36−38

The scanning electron microscope images of the polymer molecule
aggregation for polymer solutions with an injection amount of 10m3/day, and different molecular weights and concentrations after
the action of the partial pressure tool are shown in Figure 3.

As shown in Figure 3, the molecular morphologies
of polymer solutions with different
molecular weights and concentrations changed after the action of the
partial pressure tool. The molecular chains were thinned or even broken,
and the grid structure became looser. This is because the polymer
solution was subjected to mechanical shearing as the solution flowed
through the partial pressure tool. This shearing mainly resulted from
the continuous changes in the flow cross section as the solution passed
through the annular space. The mechanical shearing due to the sharp
changes in the flow rate caused the appearance of defects in the network
structure and the breaking of the molecular chains. The meshes hence
became sparse. The ability of the network structure to encapsulate
water molecules was greatly reduced, resulting in a significant reduction
in adhesion. As the molecular weight increased, the polymer solution
molecule deformation and the untwisting ability increased after the
action of the partial pressure tool. The molecular chains were gradually
thinned or even broken, and the grid structure became dispersed.39,40 The change of the molecular micro-morphology with increasing the
polymer solution concentration was consistent with the trends for
increasing molecular weight after the action of the partial pressure
tool described above, but the overall change was less significant
compared to the change of molecular weight. The negative effect of
viscosity reduction with changing the polymer solution concentration
on the action of the partial pressure tool was smaller than the effect
of changing the polymer solution molecular weight. This is consistent
with the conclusion that changing the polymer solution concentration
to enhance oil recovery is more effective than changing the molecular
weight when the partial pressure tool is used.

2.2.2 Influence of the Partial Pressure Tool on
Polymer Solution Molecular Coils
The size of the molecular
coils in the polymer solution was measured by the dynamic light scattering
method. The light scattering method is based on the optical inhomogeneity
of the polymer solution, which is caused by the thermal movement of
molecules in the medium and the resultant local stretching of the
refractive index and dielectric constant. When light of a certain
wavelength irradiates the particles, the frequency of the scattered
light will undergo a Doppler shift. The magnitude of the shift is
related to the motion speed of the particles. The translational diffusion
rate D of polymer molecules in the solution due to
the Brownian motion can be determined by displacement measurements,
and the molecular weight M and hydrodynamic radius Rh of the polymer can then be obtained from D. The dynamic light scattering instrument used in this
research can directly measure the dynamic diameter Dh (molecular coil size of the oil displacement system),
which characterizes the degree of polymer chain curling and molecular
coil size. For light scattering measurements of polymer solutions,
dilute solutions are generally used, as the distances between molecules
are relatively large, and external interference can be neglected.
However, due to thermal motion, the conformations of the molecules
change all the time, so the measured parameters are all statistical
(Table 2).

Table 2 Molecular Coil Size of Polymer Solutions

A core with a permeability ratio of 3 and
polymer solutions with
different concentrations and molecular weights were selected for the
displacement experiment at the low injection amount of 10m3/day.

By measuring the diameter of the molecular coils in polymer
solutions
with different concentrations and molecular weights and by considering
the microstructure of the polymer solution discussed previously, the
following was found: the length of the molecular chains, the complexity
of the molecular conformations, the expansion of the polymer molecular
chains, and the size Dh of the polymer
molecular coils measured by dynamic light scattering instrument all
increased with the polymer molecular mass. In addition, in polymer
solutions with a given concentration, increasing the polymer relative
molecular mass lengthened the molecular chains and increased the charged
groups contained in each molecular chain. This strengthened the total
electrostatic repulsion force in the coil and enlarged the coil size.41

After the action of the partial pressure
tool, the diameters of
the molecular coils in polymer solutions with different concentrations
and molecular weights were reduced by different degrees. The reduction
resulted from the mechanical shearing action of the partial pressure
tool on the polymer solution during the flow process, which changed
the structure of the molecular chains and reduced the size of the
molecular coils. With the increase of the polymer solution molecular
weight, the reduction of the molecular coil size changed from 17.1
to 18.7% after the action of the partial pressure tool. However, with
the increase of the polymer solution concentration, the reduction
of the molecular coil size changed from 15.2 to 16.1% after the action
of the partial pressure tool. This is a small change. Therefore, when
the partial pressure tool is used to enhance the total oil recovery,
changing the polymer solution concentration can reduce the degree
of molecular structure change caused by the shearing action of the
partial pressure tool and thus enhance the oil recovery to the greatest
extent. This conclusion is consistent with the change trend of oil
recovery with molecular micromorphology after the action of the partial
pressure tool.

3 Conclusions
The
effects of the partial pressure tool on enhancing oil recovery
and its mechanism of action on polymer solution molecules were studied
by core displacement and microscopic experiments. The following conclusions
were obtained:1. After the action of the partial pressure
tool, the oil recovery from high-permeability cores was slightly reduced,
while that from low-permeability cores was greatly increased. This
shows that the total oil recovery is increased, the highest increase
was 4.4%, and that the throttling pressure difference is directly
proportional to the total oil recovery.

2. After the action of the partial pressure
tool on high-permeability oil layers, the effect of changing the polymer
solution concentration on enhancing oil recovery was greater than
that of changing the polymer solution molecular weight.

3. The molecular structure of the polymer
solution changed after the action of the partial pressure tool. The
action of the tool thinned or even broke the molecular chains and
loosened the grid structure, resulting in a decrease in viscosity.
However, when the concentration of the solution was changed, the degree
of the molecular structure change was small, and the effect on oil
displacement was also small.

4. After the action of the partial pressure
tool, the molecular coil size of the polymer solution decreased, but
the change of the molecular coil size and the influence on the polymer
properties were small when the concentration was changed.

5. When the partial pressure
tool is used
to enhance the oil displacement effect in heterogeneous reservoirs,
a high-concentration polymer solution is more effective than a high
molecular weight polymer solution in improving the total oil recovery,
and leads to a smaller decrease in oil recovery from high-permeability
reservoirs.

45 °C.

4.1.4 Polymer Solution
The polymer used

polyacrylamide with relative molecular weights of 1600 × 104, 1900 × 104, and 2500 × 104. The degree of hydrolysis was approximately 23%. The polymer was
provided by Daqing No. 1 Oil Production Plant.

4.1.5 Partial Pressure Tool
The model
306L partial pressure tool used in the experiment was provided by
the Daqing Oilfield Oil Production Engineering Research Institute
and is made of stainless steel. The total length of the tool used
in the experiment is about 220 mm. Its annular throttling groove is
composed of multiple throttling units. The structure and structural
parameters of the tool are shown in Figure 4. The dimensions indicated in the figure
are in millimeters.

Figure 4 Structural model and parameters of the partial pressure
tool.

The structure of the tool consists
of an outer cylinder and an
annular throttling groove. Polymer solution flows in the gap between
the outer cylinder and the annular throttling groove. The crests and
troughs of the annular throttling groove appear alternately in turn,
as shown in Figure 4, resulting in periodic changes in the velocity and pressure of the
fluid in the flow channel. These periodic changes generate strong
disturbances in the velocity and pressure of the fluid and cause a
large pressure drop when the polymer solution flows through the throttling
groove.

4.2 Experimental Procedure
4.2.1 Displacement Experiment of the Polymer Solution
The
experimental setup for polymer flooding is shown in Figure 5. During the whole
experiment, the operating temperature was maintained at 45 °C.

During the experiments, the core and the concentration and molecular
weight of the polymer solution in piston container 1 were varied according
to the experimental requirements, and formation brine was injected
into piston container 2.

The partial pressure tool in the partial
pressure injection distributor
was installed or removed according to the experimental requirements.
The cross section of the partial pressure injection distributor is
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Partial
pressure injection distributor: (a) uninstalled and (b)
installed.

The experimental process is as
follows:(1) The
cores with different permeabilities
were numbered and recorded.

(2) The cores were vacuumed for about
5 h.

(3) The cores were
saturated with formation
brine, and the porosity was measured.

(4) The cores were placed in an incubator
and kept at 45 °C for 12 h.

(5) The cores were saturated with oil
until all the water was driven by oil to the model outlet, and no
more water was produced.

(6) The oil was displaced at a constant
rate until the water cut at the outlet of the model reached 98% without
the partial pressure tool in the partial pressure injection distributor
to simulate the actual onsite water cut.

(7) The polymer oil recovery in the displacement
process was calculated and recorded.

(8) The concentration and molecular weight
of the polymer solution in piston container 1 were adjusted, and the
core permeability was varied across different experiments.

(9) The partial pressure tool
in the partial
pressure injection distributor was installed and the above experimental
steps repeated. When the measurements have stabilized, the pressures
before and after the partial pressure tool was installed were recorded
to obtain the throttling pressure difference.

(10) The displacement process oil recovery
was calculated and recorded.



Due to the
low-permeability, thin oil layer thickness, and small
injection volume (30–50 m3/day) in the entire well
and the small injection volume (5–20 m3/day) in
single layers of the three types of oil layers, it is necessary to
use the partial pressure tool for layered injection in the high-permeability
oil layers to increase the oil production in the medium- and low-permeability
layers. Therefore, the injection volume of 10 m3/day was
selected and maintained for the displacement experiments.

4.2.2 Characterization of the Molecular Microscopic
Morphology of the Polymer Solution
The molecular morphology
of the polymer solution was characterized by a scanning electron microscope
(S-3400 N) by FEI company in the United States.

The experimental
process of the molecular morphology characterization is as follows:(1) Sampling. A sampler
was used to obtain
polymer solution samples before and after the action of the partial
pressure tool after the displacement experiment has stabilized.

(2) Sample preparation. In
order to truly
reproduce the aggregation morphology of polymer molecules in the solution
state, the freezing method was adopted. The samples were quickly transferred
to a freezing table onto which liquid nitrogen at −70 °C
was poured. The samples were vacuumized at the same time to sublimate
and remove the water in the solution to obtain dry samples.

(3) Coating. Samples for observation
by
a scanning electron microscope require conductivities of between 10–10 and 10–4 Ω to prevent local
charge accumulation on the samples from affecting the observation
results. The prepared dry sample was placed in a high-voltage electric
field with a certain degree of vacuum in which the high-voltage electric
field ionized the air. A layer of a conductive metal film (gold) was
then plated on the surface of the dry sample. Gold plating was carried
out twice for 30 s each time.

(4) Scanning with the electron microscope.
The sample was taken out of the freezing chamber and directly moved
into the scanning electron microscope, and observed in the sample
chamber of the SEM. Typical areas were selected for photographing
and aggregate structure analysis.



4.2.3 Characterization of the Polymer Solution
Molecular Coil
The molecular coil size (Dh) of the polymer solution was measured by a Brookhaven
BI-200SM wide-angle dynamic/static light scattering instrument system
(Brookhaven Instruments Corp, USA). The main components include a
BI-9000AT laser correlator and signal processor, an argon ion laser
(200 mW, wavelength 532.0 nm) with the measurement scattering set
to 90°, and a KQ3200DE numerical control ultrasonic cleaner.

The experimental process for the polymer solution molecular coil
characterization is as follows:(1) Sampling. The sampler was used to
obtain polymer solution samples before and after the action of the
partial pressure tool after the displacement experiment has stabilized.

(2) Filtering. The sample
was filtered
to remove dust by a nuclear microporous filter membrane with a diameter
of 0.85 μm. The sample bottle containing the sample was cleaned
for 5 min with the KQ3200DE numerical control ultrasonic cleaner.

(3) Dynamic light scattering
measurement.
The temperature of the thermostatic water bath was adjusted to 45
°C, and the sample bottle was put inside the scattering pool
for measurement. The laser was turned on, and the diaphragm adjusted
so that the scattered light intensity measured by the correlator fell
inside the appropriate range. The measurement time for each sample
was 2 min with a detection laser wavelength of 532.0 nm and a dynamic
light scattering angle of 90°.
