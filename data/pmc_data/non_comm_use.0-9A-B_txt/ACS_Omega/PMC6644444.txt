The present study
involves the synthesis, characterization, and
catalytic application of ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) supported
on plastic-derived carbons (PDCs) synthesized from plastic wastes
(soft drink bottles) as an alternative carbon source. PDCs have been
further activated with CO2 and characterized by various
analytical techniques. The catalytic activity
of Ru@PDC for the reduction of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), (K3[Fe(CN)6]), and new fuchsin (NF) dye by NaBH4 was performed under mild conditions. The PDCs had spherical
morphology with an average size of 0.5 μm, and the Ru NP (5
± 0.2 nm) loading (4.01 wt %) into the PDC provided high catalytic
performance for catalytic reduction of ferrocyanate(III) and NF dye.
This catalyst can be recycled more than six times with only a minor
loss of its catalytic activity. In addition, the stability and reusability
of the Ru@PDC catalyst are also discussed.

Introduction
Over the past few years,
biowastes and non-biodegradable plastic
waste materials as low-cost feedstock have been utilized for the production
of value-added carbon nanomaterials with a wide range of applications.1 Until now, enormous amounts of plastic wastes
were generated because of increased demand of plastic-related production.2 These plastics are not biodegradable and thus
generate extremely troublesome components for landfilling. Handling
and managing these plastic wastes is a huge task, because a large
amount of these wastes are generally dumped into landfill or disposed
in the ocean, thereby causing a very serious environmental issue.3 Therefore, a large number of methods have been
investigated to convert plastic wastes into useful products.4 For instance, they have been transformed into
different kinds of carbon-based nanostructures including nanotubes,5 spheres,6 hollow spheres,7 nanosheets,8 activated
carbons,9 and graphene flake/foil10 for sustainable energy applications.11

Carbon-based nanostructure materials,
particularly biowaste activated
carbon spheres (CSs), have gained a wide range of interests because
of their excellent energy storage ability, good electrical conductivity,
biocompatibility, and electrical properties, and thus, they have received
a wide attention.12 In recent years, active
metals supported on the porous carbon substrate such as Rh,13 Re,14 Ru,15 Os,16 Ir,17 and Pt18 have been
used as active catalysts for organic/inorganic transformations. Among
them, Ru-based nanomaterials are widely explored as nanocatalysts19 because of their low cost and attractive feature
of superior catalytic activity and stability.

Generally, potassium
hexacyanoferrate(III), (K3[Fe(CN)6]), is well-known
as one of the most common pollutants, which
is found in contaminated air, water, and soil in the environment.
It can easily accumulate inside humans, aquatic animals, and other
living organisms through food chains20 and
has been proved to have mutagenicity, acute toxicity, carcinogenicity,
and high environmental mobility, even in a trace level.21 In contrast, Fe(II) is considered as an essential
nutrient required in metabolic pathways for humans and animals. The
most common type of anemia is caused by the iron deficiency whereas
some diseases such as hemochromatosis can be due to iron overload;
the United States Recommended Daily Allowance (USRDA) for iron is
18 mg.22 Besides, the conversion of Fe(III)
into Fe(II) offers several important advantages and attractive applications
including possibilities for (i) tin purification, (ii) separation
of copper out of molybdenum ore, (iii) wine and citric acid in large-scale
preparation, (iv) serving as a benchmark for electron transfer reaction,
and (v) medical diagnosis for diabetic patients and designing of amperometric
biosensor for electrochemical applications.23

Recently, Pastoriza-Santos et al.24 carried
out the reduction of Fe(CN)63– with NaBH4, using gold nanorods containing metallodielectric hollow
shells of SiO2 or TiO2. However, these catalytic
supports are expensive compared to the carbon nanostructure. Remarkably,
these supports are difficult to remove from the active phase, but
the carbon support can be easily burnt to separate the active metallic
phase. Carregal-Romero’s group fabricated spherical Au NP heterostructures25 and have used them for catalytic reduction of
Fe(CN)63– by NaBH4 in aqueous
solution; however, this catalyst rate was 4 times higher than that
of the uncatalyzed reaction. Despite their successful results, low
stability and inconvenient recovery restrict practical application
of the materials. Jana et al.26 prepared
mesoporous Au-boehmite film catalyst for reduction Fe(CN)63–. However, this catalyst achieved large rate
constant and was four times recycled but required high loadings, harsh
conditions, and high-boiling-point aprotic solvents for the catalytic
methods. Likewise, Miao et al.27 used Fe3O4@GNSs as the catalyst for the reduction of Fe(CN)63– in aqueous media. This magnetic composite was used as an ideal catalyst and shows recyclability
along with persistent catalytic activity even after being recycled
six times. Chen et al.28 developed the
submicron-sized PEGDMA@Au NP microsphere catalyst for the reduction
of Fe(CN)63– by NaBH4 in aqueous
solution, but they failed to report recyclability and leaching experiments.
Likewise, Yang et al.29 used 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic
acid-protected Au NP as a catalyst for the same reduction. However,
the catalyst exhibits poor rate constant and lack of recyclability
and stability. Wu et al.30 have demonstrated
an ionic liquid-based synthesis of hollow and porous platinum nanotubes
as a new catalyst, however required harsh preparation conditions,
exhibited poor stability, and produced silica waste after etching.
Recently, Jiang demonstrated a new approach for the one-pot synthesis
of gold hollow nanospheres exhibiting excellent catalytic activity
toward the reduction of Fe(CN)63– by
NaBH4 in water.31 Being stable
in air and water, this catalyst could be reused 10 times. However,
a long time period was required for completion of reduction. Therefore,
the above-mentioned catalysts are less advantageous with limited practical
applications in catalysis, owing to some unique natures, such as great
chemical stability, low corrosive capability, high thermal stability,
hydrophobic feature, easy recovery, and low price.32

On the other hand, clean water is the major topic
of the current
research because it is an important source for humans and the environment.33 Discharge of effluents containing toxic dyes
and heavy metal ions from manufacturing industries such as cosmetic,
leather, paper, textile, pharmaceuticals, and so on into nearby water
bodies is highly detrimental to the human health and environment.34 Hence, the development of robust and smart functionalized
nanomaterials with practical feasibility and biocompatibility is necessitated
to act as an effective adsorbent for removal of toxic dyes.35 In particular, metals or metal oxide-containing
carbon nanomaterials have been reported as inexpensive nano-adsorbents
for the adsorption/removal of heavy metals and dyes.34,35 Thus, utilization of inexpensive nano-adsorbents for the treatment
of industrial dye effluents could be helpful in resolving the human
and environment problems.36,37

In this work,
small-sized Ru NPs were decorated on the PDC support
by the microwave-assisted (MW) reduction method, which has been popularly
employed over the past few years for its advantageous nature, such
as easy control of particle size and surface area, purity and high
production yield, quick operation time, desirable temperature regulation,
and tenability for the carbonaceous structure. Herein, we report a
novel preparation to fabricate Ru NPs supported on porous PDC (Ru@PDC)
by converting waste plastics into porous carbons. We adopted plastic
wastes as the primary carbon rich precursor and ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate
[Ru(acac)3] as a metal precursor. A more detailed description
for the preparation procedure of Ru@PDC catalyst is shown in Scheme 1.

Results and Discussion
Phase
Structure
The phase structures of the as-prepared
samples were examined using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Raman
spectroscopy. Analyzing the XRD of carbon samples exhibits two broad
peaks with low intensities at 2θ ≈ 23.5° and 43.6°
corresponding to the (002) and (100) diffraction planes ascribed to
the graphitic and amorphous carbon structure, respectively (Figure 1a). Upon increasing
the temperature, the diffraction peaks of PDC-600, PDC-700, and PDC-800
samples become broader slightly with larger intensities, indicating
that the carbon structure is characteristic of a more extent of graphitic
nature implying a trend of polymer aggregation into large polyaromatic
structures. Aggregation reactions proceed progressively with temperature
at 600 °C and higher until the carbonaceous materials are formed
showing nanometer-scale morphology containing highly organized carbons.38 On the other hand,
additional sharp diffraction peaks were observed for the Ru@PDC composite
at 2θ ≈ 38.4°, 42.3°, 44.1°, 58.5°,
69.6°, and 78.2° corresponding to the (100), (002), (101),
(102), (110), and (103) planes of the hexagonal close-packed Ru (JCPDS
06-0663), in excellent agreement with the reported values.31 The XRD pattern of Ru@PDC shows a broad peak
located at 44.1° composed of overlap between both C(100) and
Ru(101) diffractions, thus suggesting that the catalyst contains smaller
size ruthenium particles with diameters ≈5 nm. Additionally,
the low C(002) peak intensity in the catalyst was observed, because
of general lack of graphitic ordering. Scherrer formula (eq 1) in the following was adopted to
calculate the apparent crystallite size for a given reflection. 1  where D denotes the mean
size of the crystallite perpendicular to the planes (hkl) and K is a Scherrer parameter adopted as 1.84
for (100) and 0.94 for (002) for half-widths. λ is equal to
0.15406 nm, the used wavelength of the X-ray radiation, β is
the breadth at half maximum intensity in radians, and θ is the
Bragg angle for the reflection concerned. The average particle size
of Ru NP was evaluated to be 5–6 nm, consistent with the high
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) results (vide
infra).

and (d) TGA curves of the as-prepared PDC and Ru@PDC materials.

Raman Analysis
Raman spectroscopy is used to inspect
the structure defects and disorder nature of carbonaceous materials.
Raman spectra for all the samples (Figure 1b) exhibited two marked peaks at around 1344
and 1601 cm–1, which were ascribed to the D band
and G band, respectively.39 The G band
at 1592–1601 cm–1 is due to the E2g C–C stretching mode of sp2-bonded two-dimensional
hexagonal lattice of graphite layers, while the D-band at 1323–1344
cm–1 is attributed to the A1g vibrational
mode and is characteristic of the disorder nature. The intensity ratio
of ID/IG is
used to evaluate the defects of carbon-based samples; a smaller ratio
suggests more significant defects on graphitic carbons. As such, the
band intensity ratios (ID/IG) for PDC-600 and PDC-700 are 0.48 and 0.51, respectively,
both indicative of low graphitization.40 However, the peak area ratio of ID/IG for pristine PDC and Ru@PDC increased to 0.78
and 0.83, respectively, indicating graphitization enhancement of the
PDC-800 after the high-temperature treatment; the fact agrees with
the XRD measurements (see Figure 1a). The resulting ID/IG ratios of all samples were calculated and
are listed in Table 1. This consequence is in agreement with those by the XPS and HR-TEM
analyses (vide infra).

Textural Property
The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms at 77 K of PDC and Ru@PDC samples are shown in Figure 1c. The isotherms
exhibited a type-IV curve with hysteresis loop associated with capillary
condensation in the range of P/P0 from 0.45 to 0.99. This finding indicated that the porosity
of the obtained PDC and Ru@PDC was essentially made up of micropores/mesopores,
and it may be generated by the CO2 activation. The textural
properties including BET total surface area (STot), micropore surface area (SMicro), mesopore surface area (SMeso), total
pore volume (VTot), and average pore diameter
(DP) are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface area of Ru@PDC
(SBET = 396.5 m2 g–1) sample significantly decreased compared to PDC-800 (466.7 m2 g–1), indicating that Ru NPs blocked the
pores of the CSs and thus diminished the surface area and the total
pore volume of the Ru@PDC.41 These results
verified that the Ru NPs were impregnated on the surface of the PDC
matrix. The Ru NPs were well dispersed on the surface and no obvious
aggregation was observed, whereas unsupported Ru NPs were likely to
aggregate immediately.42a The Ru@PDC catalysts
were characterized and are listed in Table 1. It seems that a higher BET specific surface
area tends to favor a higher Ru dispersion. Masthan et al. have reported
the H2 dispersion measurement for Ru/γ-Al2O3, the H2 absorption equilibrium was much
faster at a higher temperature (373 K) rather than ambient temperature.42b The value of Ru dispersion and average crystallite
size for Ru-based catalysts based on H2 chemisorption method
is provided in Table S1, (Supporting Information).

The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model was
adopted to evaluate the pore size distributions in terms of the adsorption
branches of the isotherms (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).

Thermal Stability
Thermal properties
of the samples
thus prepared were further examined by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), as displayed in Figure 1d. The weight loss below 200 °C (12–18% for all
samples) can be attributed to the adsorbed water evaporation. The
other weight losses began at around 558 °C, which are mainly
due to the burning of the carbon structures. It indicated the high
purity of the prepared PDC. However, a trace amount of residues was
also observed after complete decomposition of carbon samples. Inductively
coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES)
was further employed to analyze the elemental contents, obtaining
the Zn species present in the carbon material with a content of 1017
ppm (i.e., ca. 0.10 wt %). The impregnation of ZnCl2 during
the process tended to cause dehydration of the carbon substrate and
subsequently to result in charring and aromatization along with the
creation of porosities. The mobile liquid ZnCl2 (mp ≈
283 °C) was expected to occur in the earlier stage of the activation.
Sometimes, the
Zn ions are expected to be strongly intercalated between the carbon
interlayers, when the activation temperature is increased beyond 700
°C (bp of ZnCl2 ca. 730 °C), and a strong interaction
between carbon atoms and Zn species between the carbon interlayers
might leave trace Zn residue unvaporized.21

The burning of PDC in the Ru@PDC sample began at around 561
°C because of the interaction between Ru NP and carbon atoms
inducing defects in the graphitic carbon structure of PDC.43 While further heating, no weight loss was found
significantly, verifying that the particle crystallinity took place
at 800 °C. Moreover, according to the data from TG measurements,
the content of Ru in Ru@PDC was evaluated to be 4.01 wt %. This experiment
evidences additionally that Ru NPs are successfully incorporated onto
the PDC support.

Morphology and Microstructure
The
CSs were prepared
by using plastic wastes as carbon sources without any catalysts under
hydrothermal conditions, as reported earlier.44 According to this method, the SEM images of PDC-800 spheres exhibited
uniform spherical shapes ranging from 300 to 500 nm in diameter, as
displayed in the Figure S2, Supporting Information. As can be seen, a minor agglomeration bonding between spheres can
be ascribed to polymerization interruption or structure collapse.
Additionally, the microstructures of PDC-600 and PDC-700 were further
examined using HR-TEM as displayed in Figure S3 Supporting Information, which shows appearance of smooth surface
with perfect spheres. HR-TEM observation at different magnifications
(Figure 2a,b) and enlarged
portions (Figure 2c–g)
shows the shape of the PDC-800 particle, which has sizes of few hundred
nanometers along with porous microstructure. Moreover, the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) reveals that the PDC-800 has a typical
amorphous carbon microstructure (Figure 2h), which preserves the structural integrity
and spherical morphology.

bare PDC-800 with
different magnifications and (h) electron diffraction pattern of the
representative image of PDC-800. The bars represent (a) 0.5 μm,
(b) 200 nm, (c) 100 nm, (d) 50 nm, (e) 20 nm, (f) 10 nm, and (g) 5
nm.

As shown in Figure 3, HR-TEM images of the Ru@PDC catalyst showed
that Ru NP had an average
size of 5 ± 0.2 nm, which are apparently distributed smoothly
on the surface of PDC. A representative histogram of particle size
distribution of Ru NP in Ru@PDC catalyst is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Energy-dispersive spectrometry
analysis evidenced the presence of Ru, C, and O elements in the Ru@PDC
catalyst (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Again, it is believed that Ru NPs have been successfully planted
on the surface of PDC matrix.

catalyst with

As displayed in Figure 4a–c, the additional filed emission TEM (FE-TEM)
images
of Ru@PDC verify a uniform distribution of the Ru NP on the surface
of PDC carbon matrix. The Ru presence was confirmed from SAED pattern
of Ru NPs (Figure 4d). It was found that some Ru NPs aggregate to form small clusters
with a maximum size of 6 nm. The images also indicate that some Ru
NPs are successfully planted in the PDC carbon matrix.

Surface Element Composition
Analysis
The surface element
compositions of PDC-800 and Ru@PDC samples were characterized using
XPS. Figure 5a shows
the XPS survey spectra of PDC-800 and Ru@PDC, containing C, O, and
Ru elements. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Figure 5b) exhibits a strong peak at 284.3 eV, ascribed
to the C–C/C=C bonds, and two relatively weaker peaks
with the binding energies (B.E) at about 285.1 and 288.7 eV, attributed
to the C–H and C=O species, respectively. It is notable
that the two bands with B.E at 284.3 and 280.4 eV can be readily assigned
to Ru 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively, in the
nanoparticles by referring to the values of Ru metal at 285 and 280
eV, respectively.45 As shown in Figure 5c for the O 1s spectrum,
a broad band is found and deconvoluted into four peaks with a B.E
ca. 529.9 eV (C=O), 530.7 (COOH), 532.6 (O–C–O),
and 534.2 eV (C–OH). The Ru 3p signal of Ru@PDC (Figure 5d) is fitted into a pair with
the B.E of ca. 461.1 (Ru 3p3/2) and 483.2 eV (Ru 3p1/2), corresponding to the photoemission of metallic Ru.46 Additionally, the elemental analysis by the
ICP–AES technique evidenced the presence of the Ru element
in the Ru@PDC catalyst material with a content of 4.01 wt % (see Table
S4, Supporting Information).

spectra of the pristine PDC-800 and the Ru@PDC samples,
and the corresponding core-level spectrum of (b) C 1s + Ru 3d, (c)
O 1s, and (d) Ru 3p.

FT-IR Study
FT-IR spectra were recorded for PDC and
Ru@PDC samples, and the results are shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information. The appearance of a weakly
broad band at ∼3345 cm–1 is attributed to
the hydroxyl group (−OH), and a weak band at 1638 cm–1 is attributed to the skeleton vibration of aromatic (−C=C−)
rings. The band at 2926 cm–1 is assigned to CH2 asymmetric stretching, while the band at 1442 cm–1 is ascribed to the C–H bending mode. Other bands at 1110–1258
cm–1 are due to the C–O stretching mode.11a After carbonization, most peaks disappear with
increase of temperature from 600 to 800 °C (Figure S6, Supporting Information). However, a small peak
at 1594 cm–1 remains, implying that some aromatic
rings in the carbonized samples still exist. Meanwhile, after the
carbonization process in conjunction with Ru NP immobilization, the
bands of −OH groups in the Ru@PDC nanocomposite decrease in
intensity. This is due to a strong interaction of the functional group
with Ru metal.44

In addition, different
types of plastic materials were utilized as carbon sources, including
high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE),
and polyacrylate (PC). The produced solid CSs had smooth surfaces
and the size of CSs is in the range from 3 to 8 μm (Figure S7, Supporting Information). In terms of TEM analysis
(Figure S8, Supporting Information), the
CSs produced with various plastic precursors are solid in nature,
and their spherical images of CSs can be clearly seen in all the cases
of carbon sources at 800 °C (Figure S8, Supporting Information). All samples are carbon-rich materials (∼68–69%)
as revealed by the elemental analysis and XRD patterns (Figure S9, Supporting Information), showing carbon content
on weight basis, and possession of trace amounts of heteroatoms (such
as N, S, and Cl Table S2, Supporting Information), whose presence should be beneficial to the preparation of active
carbons. Controlling of the carbonization conditions and activation
process is not the only key factor to determine porous structure of
CSs, which may also be affected by the structure and nature of the
precursors. It is important for starting plastics to possess high
content in hydrocarbons for the preparation of porous carbon by the
self-assembly approach with which hydrocarbons are aggregated into
higher poly-hydrocarbons resulting in the formation of carbon materials.
The elemental analysis (Table S3, Supporting Information) reveals that the hydrogen content is much greater in LDPE than
in HDPE and PC. As reported, it is well-known processes for the generation
of CSs from aromatic hydrocarbons and from degradation of plastic
materials to the mixture of hydrocarbons.44

Catalytic Study
Ruthenium-supported carbon materials
have been vastly envisaged for catalytic applications over the last
years.45,46 Because carbon-supported Ru NPs containing
mesoporous structures and large surface areas have been explored as
superior catalysts in the inorganic and organic fields.47 Therefore, the designed Ru@PDC catalysts can
serve as a novel catalyst for inorganic reduction reactions with a
highly efficient performance. The dispersibility of heterogeneous
catalysts in solution should play a key role in order to enhance the
catalytic activity. In this manner, the presence of functional groups
on the surface renders the catalyst to disperse fabulously in the
solution, as displayed in Figure S6b (Supporting Information).

The catalytic activities of Ru@PDC have
been tested for the reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3– using NaBH448 as a reducing
agent. Initially, we tested the blank experiment in the absence of
either reducing agent or Ru@PDC catalyst and found that the concentration
of [Fe(CN)6]3– did not change. It is
a fact that the reaction does not occur significantly in the presence
of either the reducing agent or Ru@PDC catalyst alone (Figures S10a,b, Supporting Information). Therefore, the combination
of all these reagents is required for the reduction reaction. The
catalytic activity of Ru@PDC with excess NaBH4 was performed,
showing that the characteristic yellow color (i.e., high catalytic
activity) in aqueous solution disappeared in inorganic reaction within
seconds, as shown in Figure 6a. We verified such an efficient reaction through analysis
of the catalyst effect on the kinetic reduction of K3[Fe(CN)6] in the presence of NaBH4, which is essentially
based on an electron-transfer process, and the kinetic change can
be easily monitored using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The
K3[Fe(CN)6] aqueous solution in light yellow
showed its absorption band at 420 nm. When NaBH4 was added,
the absorption intensity at 420 nm decreased gradually because of
the [Fe(CN)6]4– formation, indicating
that Fe(III) ions were reduced to Fe(II), along with the solution
color changed to colorless, as displayed in Figure 6b,c. Under the given conditions, we tested
the same reaction by NaBH4 in the presence of either the
Ru NP catalyst (Figure 5d) or available commercial Ru/C catalyst (Figure 6e); but both of them take a long period of
30 s (reaction was incomplete). These results indicated that both
Ru NP and Ru/C catalysts possess a less catalytic activity, when compared
with the Ru@PDC catalyst. This is due to insufficient porous features
to allow diffusion of reactants and products. When the concentration
of NaBH4 far exceeds [Fe(CN)6]3–, the kinetic reduction can be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction,
and then the kinetic rate R can be expressed as eq 2(49) 2  where t is the reaction time; k is the pseudo-first-order
reaction rate constant; and Ct and C0 denote the concentration
of [Fe(CN)6]3– at time t and the initial time t0, respectively.
The Ct/C0 is proportional to the relative
intensity of At/A0, where At and A0 are the peak absorbance
at time t and t0, respectively.
Hence, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model is described as eq 3 3  

Figure 6 UV–vis spectra
for the reduction of K3[Fe(CN)6] by NaBH4 in the presence of (a) Ru@PDC recorded
within 30 s, (b)1.0 mg, (c) 2.0 mg of Ru@PDC, (d) Ru NP, (e) Ru/C,
and (f) conversions vs catalysts.

The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k)
can be
estimated from the linear plot of ln(At/A0) versus the reduction
time (t). Accordingly, the rate constant (k) is calculated to be 0.0942, 0.1011, 0.0612, and 0.021
s–1, for Ru@PDC (1.0 mg; 2.0 mg), Ru NP, and ruthenium
black (Ru/C) catalysts, respectively. This plot ln(At/A0) versus
time reveals that the [Fe(CN)6]3– can
be converted completely into [Fe(CN)6]4–, as displayed in Figure 6f. Conversion of the catalytic products is determined by eq 4(50) 4  

The calculated results demonstrated
that a good conversion (98%)
was observed for the Ru@PDC catalyst, while lower conversions were
obtained by unsupported Ru NP (65%) and commercial Ru/C (23%) catalysts;
however, both the Ru NP and Ru/C catalysts show slightly a lower catalytic
activity due to its lower surface area. The Ru@PDC was found to exhibit
a much better catalytic activity for [Fe(CN)6]3– reduction than that of ruthenium black (kRu@PDCs: 0.1011 s–1 vs kRublack: 0.021 s–1). Meanwhile, the k value of Ru@PDC (0.1011 s–1) is also higher than
those of Pd/GPDAP (kPd/GPDAP = 2.330 ×
10–2 s–1),48a Au@IFMC-100 (kAu@IFMC-100 = 3.07 × 10–2 s–1),49 ce-MoS2 (kce-MoS2 = 53 ± 7 × 10–2 s–1),51 and other unsupported noble metal
nanoparticles (see Table S7, Supporting Information) under the same reaction conditions, further demonstrating that
the Ru@PDC have excellent reactivity for the [Fe(CN)6]3– reduction.

In addition, we examined the catalytic
activity of the Ru@PDC catalyst
using Na2S2O3 as an alternative reducing
agent. At first, we tested the catalytic reduction reaction in the
absence of a catalyst, but the result showed that the reduction did
not proceed significantly in Na2S2O3 solution (Figure S11a, Supporting Information). Then, we added different dosages of catalyst into the reaction
mixture and found the depletion of [Fe(CN)6]3– peaking at 420 nm (Figure S11b,c, Supporting Information), revealing that the [Fe(CN)6]3– is converted into [Fe(CN)6]4–; the
corresponding kinetic plot is given in inset of Figure S11 Supporting Information. The linear plot of ln(At/A0) against time yielded the apparent rate constant to be 0.0932 s–1 (1.0 mg) and 0.1154 s–1 (2.0 mg)
at ambient temperature (Figure S8, Supporting Information). A few important studies reported previously based
on the Na2S2O3 reducing agent are
selected for comparison with our results, as summarized in Table S7. For instance, Ajit et al.52 have reported a porous platinum nanostructured
catalyst for the catalytic reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3–, yielding a smaller rate constant, kPt NNs = 1.52 × 10–4 s–1 for 60
min. Likewise, the Au/boehmite26 catalyst
yielded the reduction rate constant, kAu/boehmite, = 5.16 × 10–5 s–1 and
NiWO4 NP53 yielded kNiWO4 NP = 1.06 × 10–4 s–1. These catalytic results are less efficient
than those obtained with the Ru@PDC catalyst.

The reaction mechanism
invoked for the catalytic reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3– in the presence of reducing agents over
the Ru@PDC catalyst comprises two steps based on the earlier reports.24 They are (i) rapid polarization of the metal
NP by NaBH4 (fast) and (ii) transfer of excess surface
electrons to [Fe(CN)6]3– complex ions
(slow). That is, an electron-transfer process must be involved to
form the reduced [Fe(CN)6]4– ions. Hence,
the reduction reactions in an aqueous solution can be written as eq 5(48b) 5  

To test the catalytic
activity of Ru@PDC, [Fe(CN)6]3– reduction
by Na2S2O3 was investigated involving
the following reaction eq 6(54) 6  

Catalytic Activity
Catalytic activity depends significantly
on particle size and shape, and thus, how to synthesize colloidal
nanoparticles with well-controlled size and shape is urgent and challenging.31 Actually, the nanomaterial owns several catalytic
merits including crystal plane, crystal phase, and small size. Among
them, the size effect is an important parameter for both homogenous
and heterogeneous catalysis. The particle size effect of metal nanoparticles
on the catalysis has been thoroughly investigated.55 Regarding the particle size effect, the Ru@PDC catalyst
yielded higher activity because of the smaller size of Ru embedded,
resulting in a faster reaction (k = 0.1011 s–1), probably due to the larger surface area (particle
size 5 ± 0.2 nm), in contrast to the boehmite supported Au NP
(15–40 nm),26 which led to the k was 0.103 min–1 for the reduction of
K3[Fe(CN)6]. Likewise, the cases of Fe3O4@Au hollow sphere20 (Au NP:
25–30 nm, k: 36.55 × 10–3 s–1), graphene/Pd47b (Pd NP: 18.8 nm, k: 36.55 × 10–3 s–1) catalysts appear to have larger particle
size than our catalyst systems. The detailed data of various catalysts
with different sizes of metal nanoparticles and their rate constants
are listed (Table S6, Supporting Information). The results indicated that the smaller particle size may lead
to a larger surface area and subsequently was favorable for a good
catalyst with high efficiency. In other words, the small nanoparticles
are more effective catalysts than the larger NP, because an increase
in the electron density for the small metal atoms leads to an increased
reactivity on the surface of the catalysts. Moreover, PDC-supported
metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) catalysts for the reduction of K3[Fe(CN)6] were investigated, and the results given
in Table S6 (Supporting Information) shows
that the reaction is sensitive to the change of metals. Turnover frequency
(TOF) is used to quantify the catalytic activity of Ru@PDC and is
defined as the number of [Fe(CN)6]3– molecules
converted to [Fe(CN)6]4– with 1.0 mg
of catalyst per s. Typically, 3.0 mmol of [Fe(CN)6]3– solution was completely reduced in the presence of
Ru@PDC in 30 s, while Ru NPs and Ru/C exhibited lower catalytic activity
within the same reaction time. We can simply calculate TOF values
for a catalytic reaction using eq 7:56 7  

The TOF
of Ru@PDC was up to 5.0 ×
10–5 s–1 for the [Fe(CN)6]3– reduction reaction, which was much larger than
those of other nanocatalysts reported previously and was comparable
with that of Ru NP and commercial Ru/C (see Table S7, Supporting Information).

Effect of Catalyst Dosage
Figure S12 Supporting Information shows
the k result
as a function of different amounts of catalyst (0.25–3.0 mg
mL–1). The k value is proportion
to the catalyst amount because of an increase in the number of reaction
sites.57 The obtained slope can be used
to evaluate the pseudo-first-order of kinetic rate constant. It becomes
feasible to understand why a large catalyst amount in the reaction
may result in a rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3–. For instance, Reddy et al.58 have demonstrated
that gum acacia-stabilized gold nanoparticles (GA/Au NPs) for catalytic
reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3– showed a similar
dependence of the k value on catalyst dosages. Moreover,
the reaction orders and the rate constants were displayed in Table
S8 (Supporting Information). Hence, the
reaction constant and the order of the reaction are increasing linearly
with increase of Ru@PDC catalyst dosage.

Stability and Reusability
Stability and reusability
should be considered for the practical applications of catalysts.59 The Ru@PDC catalyst may be facilely recovered
by ultracentrifugation (10 000 rpm) after the reaction. As
a result, the catalyst was inspected up to six consecutive cycles
for the reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3– and
monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 7a, the apparent rate constants
reveal that the catalyst preserves more than 85% of the initial catalytic
ability after six consecutive cycles. The reaction mixtures were also
analyzed by ICP–optical emission spectrometry to check if any
Ru was leached, but no significant leaching was found. Hence, the
reaction rate change cannot be caused by the loss of Ru from the catalyst.
The rational decrease of catalytic ability might be due to the trace
loss of catalyst after several times of use, as confirmed by HRTEM
images (Figure 7b,c).
The powder XRD pattern of the reused Ru@PDC catalyst demonstrates
to understand retention of the crystallinity after the catalytic reaction
as shown in Figure 7d. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the
Ru NP proved the existence of an elemental ruthenium signal. Other
EDX signals emitting from C, O, and Cu atoms were also noticed (Figure 7e). This result indicated
that the Ru species were successfully immobilized on the nanocomposite,
even after being recycled six times.

FE-TEM images, (d)
XRD pattern, (e) EDX spectrum, (f) N2 sorption-isotherm,
and (g) corresponding pore size distribution of the reused Ru@PDC
catalyst.

Figure 7f shows
the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the reused Ru@PDC
catalyst and pore-size distributions (Figure 7g) derived from the adsorption branch of
the isotherms according to the BJH method. We also noted that the
surface area of the spent Ru@PDC catalyst had shown slightly lower
surface area (SBET = 388.3 m2 g–1) than the fresh catalyst (SBET = 396.5 m2 g–1, Table 1) after six uses.
The catalytic activity decreased from the fourth to sixth cycles,
probably because of the loss of catalyst during the recycling process.
Notably, the reused catalyst exhibits a type-IV curve corresponding
to a mesoporous structure with pore volume (VTot = 0.080 cm3 g–1); hence, these
results demonstrated that the reused Ru@PDC catalyst remained stable
without any change in its porous structure after six runs.

Reduction
of New Fuchsin (NF)
In addition, we performed
the reduction of a cationic triarylmethane dye (new fuchsin, NF);
the chemical structure and characteristics of dye used in the study
is shown in Table S9, (Supporting Information). The reduction process of NF dye was monitored using UV–vis
spectrophotometry, as shown in Figure 8. Note that the reaction does not proceed significantly
in the absence of catalyst, indicating the indispensable role of the
catalyst for the NF reduction. As shown in Figure 8b–f, the absorbance peak of NF at
543 nm decreases to a different extent depending on the added amount
of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 mg of Ru@PDC catalyst. The NF solution
changes red color to colorless when the reduced NF is formed, confirming
the catalytic activities (inset of Figure 8b–f). As revealed in Figure 8g, the absorbance at 543 nm
disappears within 9 min after the introduction of 3.0 mg of Ru@PDC
catalyst. In contrast, 30, 18, 16, and 13 min are required to complete
the reduction by adding 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg of catalysts, respectively
(see Figure 8h). It
suggests that an increased catalyst dosage should result in fast diffusion
of dye molecules/reagents on the catalyst surface and thus enhance
the catalytic activity which may be reflected in the apparent rate
constant kapp measurements (Figure 8h). The kapp value is evaluated to be 0.1911, 0.3061, 0.4019, 0.6903,
and 0.7601 min–1 for addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0, and 3.0 mg of catalyst, respectively (see Figure 8i). These results indicate that the reaction
follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics because of the presence of excessive
NaBH4. The kapp obtained for
Ru@PDC (0.7601 min–1) turns out to be much larger
than that of graphene quantum dots (kGQDs = 0.0263 min–1).60 The
fact may be caused by (i) a large surface area of Ru@PDC to effectively
adsorb a more amount of NF molecules and (ii) fast electron transfer
from NaBH4 to the adsorbed NF dye molecules via the catalyst.
Thus, it facilitates the reduction of organic pollutants absorbed
on the catalyst surface.

Conclusions
In this work, a porous
and heterogeneous stable catalyst, Ru@PDC,
was successfully prepared and characterized. The catalyst exhibit
enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of inorganic complex
and cationic dye with higher reaction kinetics as compared with other
catalysts. Furthermore, the as-prepared nanocatalyst possesses several
advantages: (i) it can be easily separated from the reaction mixture,
(ii) not much loss of catalytic activity is found even after several
cycles of reuse, (iii) it takes short time (∼30 s) to complete
the reaction showing superior activity, (iv) the catalyst was fabricated
using plastic as solid waste feedstock, and (v) moreover, the catalyst
has been used for perspective applications. The catalysts were found
to be stable and effective for more than 6 runs, with a conversion
efficiency of ∼98%. The decrease of conversion can be probably
attributed to a reduction in the surface active sites of the catalyst.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3, ≥99.9%), ruthenium black (Ru/C, ≥98%), potassium
ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6], 99%), New Fuchsin
(NF), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99.99%), and sodium thiosulphate
(Na2S2O3, ≥98%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals belonged to analytical grade,
and all solutions were freshly prepared using Milli-Q water.

Preparation
of Porous Carbon
Plastic-derived carbon
(PDC) have been prepared from soft drink plastics collected from a
local market at Taipei, which were utilized as carbon sources according
to the methods reported previously.7−9 Typically, waste plastic
bottles shredded into small size of 30–50 mm pieces (∼2.0
g) were added in the 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave. The sealed autoclave was then heated to the temperature
(ramp at 20 °C min–1) in the muffle furnace
at ∼300 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the carbonaceous material
was cooled slowly back to room temperature (RT), followed by thorough
washing with copious amounts of benzene and ethanol, and then air-dried
at 100 °C overnight. The PDC samples thus obtained were represented
to be PDC-x, where x denotes the
final carbonization temperature (in °C) used. To enhance their
porosities, the PDC substrates were pyrolyzed again under the condition
of flowing CO2 (flow rate 30 mL min–1) at 400 °C for 30 min. In comparison, the carbon sources generated
by other plastic materials such as HDPE, LDPE, PC, and polypropylene
showed the maximum extent of oil formation containing aromatic hydrocarbons
to form CSs. The mechanism of char formation in the thermal process
of polymer degradation was interpreted appreciably elsewhere.3,4 Furthermore, we have analyzed the chemical composition of plastic
wastes and their elemental composition of plastic-derived char (before
activation), PDC (after activation), and Ru@PDC as displayed in Tables
S2–S4, Supporting Information. In
addition, the yields of carbon after carbonization and activation
under different conditions were presented in Table S5, Supporting Information.

Physical Activation
In general, the endothermic reactions
for physical activation of the carbonaceous material by using water
vapor steam and CO2 are shown in eqs 8 and 9(61) 8   9   10   11  

Besides, the C +
H2O reaction
in eq 8 is accompanied
by the formation of CO2 + H2, while catalyzed
on the carbon surface as shown in eq 10. Because of endothermic reactions for eqs 8 and 9, the
activation process may be controlled accurately in the heating furnace.
External heating to remain high temperature is required to drive.
In contrast to the reactions 8 and 9 which can be driven accurately at high temperature, the reaction 11 is extremely exothermic and its progression is
difficult to control. A decrease in the average particle size and
the product yield may happen as a result of over-heating the external
carbon surface.62

Preparation of the Ru@PDC
Catalyst
Ru@PDC nanocomposite
was obtained by immobilization of Ru NPs on the PDC-800 support. In
brief, 0.2 g of the as-prepared PDC-800 powdered sample was mixed
with Ru(acac)3 for 4.01 wt % loading in 5.0 mL tetrahydrofuran.
Then, the mixture was removed into a 50 mL Teflon-coated microwave
reactor for microwave irradiation at power of 300 W for 1 h. The Ru0 state was reduced effectively from the Ru3+ ions
upon irradiation and was dispersive on the mesoporous PDC carbon support.

Catalyzed Reduction of Ferrocyanate(III)
To conduct
the reduction reaction, we prepared 3.0 mL of 3 × 10–3 M [K3Fe(CN)6] into 1.0 mg mL–1 Ru@PDC catalyst and then added rapidly 0.2 mL of 0.04 M ice-cold
fresh NaBH4 or Na2S2O3. As the reaction proceeded, the solution in yellow faded to be colorless.
Subsequently, the kinetic measurements were carried out for K3Fe(CN)6 by using UV–vis spectroscopy fixed
at 420 nm to monitor the reduction reaction in a quartz cuvette. When
the reaction was complete, the catalyst was removed by using an ultracentrifuge
for further investigation of its reusability.

Catalyzed Reduction of
the Cationic Dye
Experimental
procedure for the cationic dye reduction is based on an earlier report.63 Typically, 1.0 mg mL–1 of
solid catalyst (Ru@PDC) was added into 3.0 mL of NF (5 mM) dye solution
at RT under vigorous magnetic stirring in dark condition for 5 min
to allow the dye molecules adsorbed physically onto the Ru@PDC composite.
Then, 0.1 mL of 0.04 M ice-cold NaBH4 was added and the
mixture was kept stirring under ambient conditions. Approximately,
3.0 mL of sample was taken from the mixture and the dye solution was
analyzed by UV–vis spectrophotometric measurements (at 553
nm) to follow the catalytic reduction reaction.
