We report here on
a series of redox active benzothiadiazole-based
luminophores functionalized on one edge with a phenyl-nonyl substituent,
which confers these molecules a rodlike shape and a tendency to self-assemble
into layered superstructures. On the other edge, the molecules are
endowed with different p-substituted phenyl rings, which allows the
modulation of their redox and optical properties on the basis of the
electronic nature of the terminal substituents. We have found that
just one lateral alkyl chain is sufficient to induce mesomorphism
in these molecules, which present nematic or smectic mesophases upon
thermal treatment. Single-crystal analysis allows us to get an insight
into the nature of the forces responsible for different supramolecular
assemblies in these derivatives, and point to a strong contribution
of the terminal groups in the different arrangements observed. The
interesting redox and optical properties together with their self-assembling
tendencies render these new materials interesting candidates for optoelectronics.

Introduction
The area of organic
electronics has evolved in only a few years
from basic research to the development of devices such as organic
light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are already being massively commercialized.1,2 Organic active layers can be usually implemented in devices by different
solution-processing techniques in contrast to the expensive lithography
and vacuum techniques required for silicon-based materials offering
interesting opportunities to obtain low-cost devices.

On the
other hand, the high versatility of organic chemistry allows
the rational development of organic materials, with a high control
of their final properties. Fundamental parameters for the development
of molecules for their incorporation in (opto)electronic devices,
such as light emission or absorption properties, energy levels, etc.,
can be designed “a la carte”, thanks to the deep knowledge
that has been acquired in the last few years through numerous structure–properties
studies.4 Unfortunately, our ability to
predict/control the supramolecular arrangement of electro/photoactive
molecules is still very limited, although the electronic properties
of organic materials depend not only on those of the building units
but also on how the molecules are organized in the bulk.

Thus,
in the search of device-oriented molecular systems, self-assembling
materials,5 able to self-organize, through
the cooperation of different intramolecular forces, represent interesting
candidates in the area. In this context, liquid crystalline ordering
has emerged as an attractive concept in the development of materials
for (opto)electronic applications.6,7 The dynamic
character of the mesophases confers to them interesting self-healing
properties and facilitates their processing as highly ordered thin
films from solution or melt. The design principles to induce liquid-crystalline
phases are well established and usually require a molecular disk-shaped
(discotic liquid crystals) or rod-shaped (calamitic liquid crystals)
π-conjugated core, functionalized with alkyl chains on their
periphery to induce microphase segregation upon thermal heating.8 Discotic liquid crystals, with their highly anisotropic
columnar organization, have been long identified as one-dimensional
semiconductors,9−12 exhibiting, in some cases, remarkable hole13,14 and electron15,16 mobility values. However, the
anisotropic character of charge transport in these systems and the
difficult alignment of the columns on substrates with an edge-on configuration
have hampered their incorporation in devices17−19 Although less
explored in this area, calamitic liquid crystals that are much more
fluid and easy to align have emerged as interesting alternatives.20−23 Particularly, the smectic mesophases found in different monoalkyl
rod-shaped molecules have been demonstrated to be promising vehicles
to obtain homogeneous films with reduced grain boundaries and a favorable
layered arrangement for charge transport.21,23

In the last few years, the benzothiadiazole (BTD) core has
emerged
as a promising molecular design motif in the development of device-oriented
small molecule and polymeric materials. This electron-deficient moiety
presents interesting n-type semiconducting properties and high fluorescence
quantum efficiencies and has a strong propensity to adopt quinoid
conformations, thus facilitating charge transfer (CT) between attached
substituents and enabling the tuning of its electronic properties.
Because of these attractive properties, this molecule has been extensively
incorporated as an active layer in electronic devices.24−27 By symmetrical functionalization with two aryl groups endowed with
flexible chains, several BTD-based nematic and smectic liquid crystals28 have been synthesized and incorporated as an
active layer in organic field effect transistors (OFETs)25 or as highly dichroic fluorescent dyes for liquid
crystal displays.29 However, to our knowledge,
asymmetric monoalkyl liquid crystalline BTD derivatives have not yet
been reported.

In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis
and the electronic
and self-assembling properties of a series of asymmetrically functionalized
rod-shaped electroactive benzothiadiazole derivatives, presenting
interesting redox and light-emitting properties. These molecules are
endowed on one edge with a phenyl-nonyl substituent and on the other
edge with different p-substituted phenyl rings. Interestingly, we
have found that just one lateral alkyl chain is enough to induce mesomorphism
in these molecules that present nematic or smectic mesophases upon
thermal treatment, which allows us to use the other terminal substituent
to modulate their electronic properties. Thus, by systematic variation
of the electronic nature of these substituents, we could fine-tune
the redox and optical properties of these derivatives. The attached
substituents also play a key role in how these molecules self-assemble
in crystalline or liquid crystalline phases by participating in different
intermolecular interactions, as could be unequivocally determined
through single-crystal analysis.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis of compounds 3–7 was performed in two steps of palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling
reactions (Scheme 1). Initially 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 1 was
reacted with 1 equiv of 4-nonylphenylboronic acid. Under thermal heating
conditions, compound 2 is obtained, along with some byproduct
of double coupling and unreacted dibrominated benzothiadiazole. Monocoupling
can be favored by using microwave heating conditions, which provides
compound 2 in good yield in just 3 h. Starting from 2, compounds 3–7 were synthesized
straightforwardly in the second step by Suzuki cross-coupling with
the corresponding p-substituted phenyl boronic acid under microwave
heating. All new compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography,
using a mixture of hexane/CH2Cl2 (3:1) as eluent
and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass
spectrometry.

Liquid Crystalline Properties
With the aim of investigating
the propensity of these compounds to organize in smectic/nematic mesophases,
we studied their thermal properties. Please note that although several
rod-shaped BTD-based nematic and smectic liquid crystals have been
reported, to our knowledge, all of them exhibit a C2 symmetry.25,28,29

The thermal transitions and mesomorphic properties were studied
by polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). With the exception of 5, all of these derivatives showed mesomorphic properties (see Table 1 and the Supporting Information).

Derivatives 4 and 6 displayed
enantiotropic
liquid crystalline mesophases, whereas 3 and 7 exhibited monotropic liquid crystalline behavior. Schlieren textures
with homeotropic domains were obtained by POM for all four compounds,
indicating that the mesophases have an orthogonal character (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Micrograph of the textures
observed by POM for (A) 4 at 90 °C (cooling, 20×)
and (B) 6 at 90 °C
(cooling, 20×).

To determine the nature of the mesophases and the structural
parameters,
we performed the XRD studies. The diffractograms recorded for 3, 4, and 7 only contains broad
diffuse maxima, suggesting the absence of a long-range positional
order in the liquid crystal phase. These types of patterns are typical
of nematic mesophases, which have only orientational order.

In contrast, the diffractogram of compound 6 is in
agreement with a smectic phase, which has been assigned as a smectic
A organization, given the orthogonal character of the mesophases deduced
from the presence of homeotropic domains in the textures observed
by POM. Its X-ray diffraction pattern shows a sharp, strong maximum
in the small-angle region (assigned to the first-order reflection
of the smectic layer) and a diffuse halo (related to the conformational
disorder of the liquid-like chain in the high-angle region). A layer
spacing of 39.4 Å was deduced by applying the Bragg’s
law to the small-angle maximum. This spacing is significantly larger
than the molecular length in its most extended conformation (25.2
Å), which suggests that the mesophase adopts a bilayer structure.

This bilayer arrangement is reminiscent of that observed in cyanobiphenyl
liquid crystals,30,31 the first liquid crystals with
technological applications, and points to an important contribution
of the nitrile groups in the smectic behavior of this compound via
dipole–dipole interactions. Please note that the use of promesogenic
cyanobiphenyl core continues to play a fundamental role in the liquid
crystals arena.32−36

Crystal Structure
To shed light on the influence of
the substituents on the different arrangements observed, we attempted
to grow single crystals of different compounds. Single crystals of
sufficient quality for structure determination were obtained for 4, 6, and 7 by slow evaporation
of 1:1 CH2Cl2/CH3CN solutions at
room temperature. We found that the terminal substituents also significantly
affect the self-assembling trends of these molecules, as they are
involved in intermolecular interactions with the BTD core, or in the
case of the cyano groups by establishing dipolar interactions among
the terminal nitriles.

Compound 4 crystallizes
in the triclinic space group P1̅, with two
independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The main difference
between the two independent units is derived from different torsion
angles between the BTD unit and the phenyl linkers, which, in each
molecule, are rotated in opposite directions (by 39.44 and 31.88°
in one of the molecules and by 33.73 and 27.42° in the other).

The compound crystallizes to form dimers, which are stabilized
by O···S (2.964 Å) and CH···N (2.877
Å) interactions (Figure 2a). These dimers form layers driven by C–H···π
interactions involving the neighboring phenyl rings (Figure 2b), whereas the BTD rings are
situated in a parallel-displaced arrangement. The long alkyl chains
are strongly interdigitated (Figure 2c).

between dimers and (B) between molecules of the same layer. (C) Crystal
packing view along (a).

Compound 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic space
group C2/c, with two independent
molecules in
the asymmetric unit. Again the main difference between two independent
units is derived from different torsion angles between the BTD unit
and the phenyl linkers, which, in this case, are rotated in the same
directions (by 48.36 and 44.88° in one of the molecules and by
46.32 and 45.73° in the other).

The analysis of the crystal
packing shows that 6 is
organized in a bilayered structure, as previously observed in the
mesophases (Figure 3). An analysis of the close contacts in the structure evidences the
antiparallel coupling of the cyano end groups, demonstrating the leading
role of the nitrile groups in the attained bimolecular arrangement,
via dipolar interactions. No interdigitation of the alkyl chains can
be detected in this case.

of 6 (A)
between molecules of the same layer. (B) Crystal packing view along
(b).

Compound 7 crystallizes
in the monoclinic space group P21/c and has one independent
molecule in the asymmetric unit. Both phenyl rings are rotated in
the same directions by 31.69 and 37.90° with respect to the BTD
unit.

The molecules adopt an extended conformation and arrange
in a highly
compact superstructure, in which the molecules grow with their long
axis nearly parallel to the a-axis of the unit cell
(Figure 4). The analysis
of the short contacts in the crystal packing shows a nonbonded interaction
between the sulfur atom and one of the oxygen atoms of the nitro group
situated at an interatomic distance of 3.0 Å. This indicates
that again the stabilization of this structure involves the attached
functional groups.

between molecules of the same layer. (B) Crystal packing view along

Electronic Properties
The tendency of these molecules
to self-assemble into layered arrangements, as shown above, render
them very attractive for the easy formation of ordered thin films
to be implemented in devices. In the search for molecules that can
be incorporated in the devices, it is also highly desirable to be
able to fine tune their electronic properties. With this in mind,
we have investigated how the electronic nature of the terminal groups
influence the optical and redox properties of these molecules by means
of optical (UV–vis absorption and fluorescence) spectroscopy
and cyclic voltammetry (CV).

The absorption properties of the
BTD derivatives 3–7 were recorded
in a 10–5 M dichloromethane solution by UV–vis
spectroscopy at room temperature. All of the derivatives show two
absorption bands: one at high energies associated with the π
→ π* transitions of the molecule and other at lower energies
assigned to charge transfer (CT) transition involving the end groups.
In compounds 3 and 4, which are substituted
with electron-donor groups, the CT band is red-shifted. This behavior
is more notable for 3 functionalized with the strongest
dimethylamine donor (Table 2 and Figure 5a).

The electrochemical properties of
the compounds 3–7 were investigated
by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All of the
compounds can be easily reduced to stable radical anions, thus reflecting
the strong acceptor character of the BTD core. The reduction potential
of the derivatives substituted with electron donors is nearly identical;
however, the reduction potentials move to less negative values as
the electron-acceptor character of the substituents is increased and
therefore the electron density in the π system is lowered.

Interestingly, derivatives 3–5 present
an amphoteric redox character, as they can be also easily
oxidized in the accessible solvent window and the oxidation potentials
shifts anodically with increase in the acceptor character of the substituent.
Compound 3 presents a second oxidation wave because of
the oxidation of the NMe2 group (Table 2 and Figure 5b).

The energy of the HOMO−LUMO levels
of compounds 3−5 was estimated from
their first oxidation and
the reduction potentials respectively, by referring the potentials
to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple and considering a value
of −4.8 eV for ferrocene with respect to zero vacuum level.
In compounds 6 and 7, which show only a
reduction process, the HOMO level was calculated by subtracting the
value of the optical gap from that of the LUMO level, estimated electrochemically.

The position of the HOMO and LUMO levels calculated for 3 and 4 are adequate for the easy injection of electrons
and holes from common electrodes of much relevance for potential electronic
applications. Conversely, those of 5–7 are more appropriate for the easy injection of electrons (see Table 2).

All of these
compounds emit intensely in a solution and their emission
wavelengths are also strongly influenced by the electronic nature
of the substituents. In 10–5 M dichloromethane solutions,
compounds 5–7 emit cyan fluorescence,
with maxima being barely affected by the electron-withdrawing character
of the substituents. Conversely, the emission of compounds 3 and 4 is significantly red-shifted as a result of their
increased intramolecular charge transfer.

Compound 3 presents an orange-red fluorescence at
644 nm, whereas 4 exhibits a maximum at 532 nm with the
emission of a shiny yellow color (Table 2 and Figure 5a). High Stokes shifts are observed in all of the cases,
which again show a strong dependence of the nature of the terminal
substituents; 5–7 present Stokes
shifts around 110 nm and 3 and 4 show Stokes
shifts of 198 and 133 nm, respectively.

We have investigated
the light-emitting properties of these compounds
in different environments. The fluorescence spectra of compounds 3–7 show a strong solvent dependence.
The emission bands shift bathochromically as the solvent polarity
is increased. This behavior is more significant in compound 3, with a higher charge-transfer character, whose emission
maximum shows a remarkable shift of more than 100 nm from cyclohexane
(541 nm) to CH2Cl2 (645 nm) and fluorescence
is completely quenched in MeOH. The strong influence of the polarity
of the solvent in the emission properties of 3 is probably
related to the formation of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer
states in this compound.37 The environmental
sensitivity of the light-emitting properties of this compound represents
a promising property toward its application in sensing/bioimaging.

Interestingly, all of these compounds emit intensely also in solid
state and mesophase. Please note that strong intermolecular interaction
and close packing usually lead to quenching of emission. In the condensed
states, the maximum emission wavelengths are slightly blue-shifted
when compared to the fluorescence in CH2Cl2 solution
(Table 3). The observed
hypsochromism is probably associated with higher dihedral angles between
the phenyl rings and the benzothiadiazole cores in the more constrained
environments of the crystalline and liquid crystalline phases, which
would reduce the extent of π-delocalization in these rod-shaped
compounds.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a new series of redox active monoalkyl liquid crystalline
BTD fluorophores functionalized on one edge with a phenyl-nonyl substituent
and on the other edge with different p-substituted phenyl rings have
been synthesized and characterized with the aim of finding molecules
of potential interest for electronic applications.

We have found
that attaching only one terminal alkyl chain to the
4,7-diphenyl BTD core is enough to induce mesomorphism in these molecules
and to prompt their self-assembly into layered supramolecular arrangements,
as could be determined by the single-crystal analysis. The other terminal
groups allow fine-tuning of the electronic properties of these molecules
(by influencing the intramolecular charge transfer in the system)
and the modulation of their mesomorphic behavior and crystal packing
by participating in different intermolecular interactions.

The
easy reversible oxidation/reductions of these BTD derivatives
and adequate HOMO–LUMO levels for the easy injection of charge
carriers, together with their efficient light-emitting properties
and tendency to self-assemble to form layered arrangements (highly
favorable for charge/exciton migration transport), make these derivatives
promising candidates for incorporation in devices such as OLEDs and
OFETs. Compound 6 especially has a remarkable bilayer
arrangement, which together with its favorable amphoteric redox properties
renders it a promising candidate for ambipolar OFETs. Work along these
lines is in progress.

X-ray Structure Determinations
Crystals of 4, 6, and 7 were mounted on a Bruker four
circle kappa-diffractometer equipped with a Cu INCOATED microsource,
operated at 30 W power (45 kV, 0.60 mA) to generate Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54178 Å), and a Bruker VANTEC 500 area detector
(microgap technology). Crystals of 4 and 7 showed well-defined faces, while crystals of 6 growed
as polysynthetic twins. Diffraction data were collected exploring
more than a hemisphere of the reciprocal space using a combination
of φ and ω scans to reach a resolution of 0.86 Å.
The structures were solved by the Multan and Fourier methods. Most
of the calculations were carried out with APEXII software for data
collection and reduction, and OLEX238 for
structure solution and refinements. CCDC 1834993, CCDC 1834974, and
CCDC 1834997 contain the supporting crystallographic data of 4, 6, and 7, respectively.

Crystal data for 4: C28H32N2OS, M = 444.61 crystal dimensions: 0.35 ×
0.04 × 0.02 mm3, triclinic, P1̅

K, Z = 4, ρcalcd = 1.242 g cm–3. The structure was refined anisotropically R1(F) = 0.0685 for observed
data (I > 2σ(I)), final R values (all data) R1(F) = 0.1663, wR2(F) = 0.2451 for all data.

Crystal data for 6: C28H29N3S, M = 439.60
crystal dimensions: 0.50 ×
0.10 × 0.04 mm3, monoclinic, C12/c1 space group, unit cell dimensions: a = 82.379(9), b = 7.9627(9), c =
14.7427(13) Å, α = 90°, β = 93.622(7)°,
γ = 90°, V = 9651.3(17) Å3, T = 200 K, Z = 16, ρcalcd = 1.210 g cm–3. The structure was refined
anisotropically R1(F)
= 0.1466 for observed data (I > 2σ(I)), final R values (all data) R1(F) = 0.1859, wR2(F) = 0.3417 for all data. Two independent
molecules are present in the structure showing one of them thermal
noresolvable disorder. Seven soft restrictions (4 DFIX, 3 DELU) 
have been applied to the disordered molecule.

Crystal data for 7: C27H29N3O2S, M = 459.59 crystal dimensions:
0.4 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3, monoclinic, P121/c1 space group, unit cell dimensions: a = 11.228(2), b = 8.077(2), c = 26.434(5) Å, α = 90°, β = 93.70(3)°,
γ = 90°, V = 2392.4(9) Å3, T = 250 K, Z = 4, ρcalcd = 1.276 g cm–3. The structure was refined
anisotropically R1(F)
= 0.0583 for observed data (I > 2σ(I)), final R values (all data) R1(F) = 0.0866, wR2(F) = 0.1323 for all data.

Crystal
data for 6. Explanation to checkcifs: The
crystal diffracts poorly and some reflexions are weak and missing.
Because of the theta-full value is slightly lower than 0.95.

Mesomorphic
Properties
The optical textures of the
mesophases were studied with an Olympus polarizing microscope BX51
equipped with a Linkam hot-stage and Linkam TMS 91 central processor.
The transition temperatures and enthalpies were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry with a TA Instruments Q20 instrument operated
at a scanning rate of 10 °C min–1 on both heating
and cooling. The apparatus was calibrated with indium (156.6 °C;
28.71 J g–1) as the standard. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out in a TGA-Q5000 apparatus at a heating
rate of 10° min–1 under nitrogen up to 600
°C and under air from 600 to 750 °C. The XRD patterns at
the mesophases were obtained with a pinhole camera (Anton-Paar) operating
with a point-focused Ni-filtered Cu Kα beam. The sample was
held in Lindemann glass capillary (1 mm diameter) and heated, when
necessary, in a variable-temperature oven. The capillary axis is perpendicular
to the X-ray beam and the pattern is collected on flat photographic
film perpendicular to the X-ray beam. Spacing was obtained via Bragg’s
law.

Linear Spectroscopy
The UV–vis studies were
carried out on a PrekinElmer Lambda XLS+ spectrometer. The fluorescence
spectra were recorded on an Aminco SLM 8000 spectrophotometer.

Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments
were performed on a Bioanalytical System Inc. (BASI) Epsilon electrochemical
workstation in a three-electrode cell at room temperature under nitrogen
atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in dichloromethane
solutions (c = 1 × 10–3 M)
containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate
(TBAPF6) of supporting electrolyte at a scan rate 100 mV
s–1. A three-electrode setup was used, including
a platinum working electrode, a Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference electrode,
and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. Ferrocene was used as an
internal standard, and all potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium
redox couple.
