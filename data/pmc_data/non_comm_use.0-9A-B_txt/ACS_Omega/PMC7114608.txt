Pyrophosphate arthropathy is the
mineralization defect in humans
caused by the deposition of microcrystals of calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate in joint tissues. As a potential therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of pyrophosphate arthropathy, delivery of exogenous
pyrophosphate-hydrolyzing enzymes, inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases),
to the synovial fluid has been suggested. Previously, we synthesized
the conjugates of Escherichia coli PPase
(Ec-PPase) with detonation synthesis nanodiamonds (NDs) as a delivery
platform, obtaining the hybrid biomaterial retaining high pyrophosphate-hydrolyzing
activity in vitro. However, most known PPases including Ec-PPase in
the soluble form are strongly inhibited by Ca2+ ions. Because
synovial fluid contains up to millimolar concentrations of soluble
calcium, this inhibition might limit the in vivo application of Ec-PPase-based
material in joint tissues. In this work, we proposed other bacterial
PPases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt-PPase), which are resistant to the inhibition by Ca2+ ions, as an active PPi-hydrolyzing agent. We synthesized
conjugates of Mt-PPase with NDs and tested their activity under various
conditions. Unexpectedly, conjugates of both Ec-PPase and Mt-PPase
with aminated NDs retained significant hydrolytic activity in the
presence of well-known mechanism-based PPase inhibitors, fluoride
or calcium. The incomplete inhibition of PPases by fluoride or calcium
was found for the first time.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
problem of treatment of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease
(CPPD disease, or pseudogout) has remained unsolved for many years.1−3 The disease is caused by deposition of microcrystals of calcium
pyrophosphate dihydrate in joint tissues.4 Most of the symptoms of this disease are due to the immune response
of neutrophils attacking calcium pyrophosphate crystals.5−7 One of the most significant events leading to the CPPD disease is
increased production of enzymes responsible for the synthesis and/or
transport of P2O74– pyrophosphate
anions to the tissue matrix. Examples are overproduction of a transport
protein ANKH8 or increased activity of
the pyrophosphate-producing enzymes ENPP1.9

To date, no specific treatment for the CPPD disease has been
developed.1−3 The drugs used for this purpose have a number of
serious side effects
because of which they are not commonly used in clinical practice.10 Thus, the search for and development of new
strategies and highly effective, low-toxicity agents for the treatment
of the CPPD disease is a significant challenge in modern rheumatology
and nanomedicine.11

Soluble inorganic
pyrophosphatases (PPases, E.c. 3.6.1.1) found
in all known organisms catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate
into inorganic phosphate (Pi). Mammalian cells express
two PPases, cytoplasmic PPA112 and mitochondrial
PPA2,13 encoded by different genes. Cytoplasmic
PPase is an essential house-keeping enzyme maintaining normal cell
growth and division by utilizing intracellular pyrophosphate (PPi), the byproduct of key biosynthetic reactions, for example,
DNA synthesis. Human PPA1 can also dephosphorylate c-Jun N-terminal
kinase JNK and is thus involved in clinically significant processes
regulated by this signaling pathway, for example, neurite growth,
cancer progression, and so forth.14−16 Overexpression of PPA1
detected in tumors of various origin correlates with their malignant
potential, clinicopathological parameters, and prognosis in patients.17−20 PPase PPA2 in humans is transported to the mitochondria where it
is important for maintaining the membrane potential and other mitochondrial
functions.13,21 PPases are absent in the extracellular
matrix or synovial fluid where PPi-hydrolyzing activity
relies on other enzymes, for example, tissue-nonspecific alkaline
phosphatases, TNAPs.22,23

Yeast PPase was earlier
suggested as a potential therapeutic agent
for the treatment of the CPPD disease24 because it efficiently hydrolyzes pyrophosphate.25 Pyrophosphate is present in excess in the articular and
periarticular tissues of patients26 and
leads to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate microcrystals.27 However, the in vivo use of carrier-free enzymes
has many drawbacks and limitations.28 Among
the possible carriers, detonation synthesis nanodiamonds (NDs) are
promising agents of drug delivery into cells and tissues.29 NDs have the ability to penetrate biological
barriers, so they can be used as carriers for the targeted delivery
of immobilized proteins.30

In our
previous paper, we synthesized a number of covalent and
noncovalent conjugates of inorganic pyrophosphatase with NDs that
retained high hydrolytic activity, implying their possible applications
in the treatment of the CPPD disease.31 It is assumed that PPase included in the heterogeneous conjugates
with NDs has a number of advantages compared with the carrier-free
form. Among other tissues, ND samples have been shown to penetrate
the bone tissue after intratracheal instillation; therefore, they
can potentially be used as carriers for the delivery of proteins (e.g.,
PPases) to the site of precipitation of CaPPi crystals.32 A predicted advantage of the proposed hybrid
material will be its increased resistance to degradation by matrix
proteases. It is assumed that the protein molecules trapped in conjugates
are less accessible to proteolytic digestion than the carrier-free
enzyme. This combination of properties makes conjugates of PPases
with NDs a promising new biomaterial.

Considering the known
protein-phosphatase activity of human PPase,
its cell growth-promoting effects, and possible involvement in key
regulatory pathways, we suggested bacterial PPases devoid of these
properties as the source of exogenous PPase activity of the new material.
PPase from Escherichia coli (Ec-PPase)
was used in our previous work as a model PPase for obtaining conjugates
and testing their properties. However, some catalytic features of
Ec-PPase may limit the application of its conjugates to joint tissues.
In particular, calcium ions in vitro completely inhibit Ec-PPase with
an inhibition constant of 2–12 μM.33 Calcium levels outside the cell are rather high; for example,
synovial fluid contains up to 2 mM Ca2+,34 which is expected to completely block the activity of Ec-PPase
conjugates in biological samples. Our recent preliminary data suggested
that inorganic pyrophosphatase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt-PPase) binds calcium ions and other known inhibitors of PPases
with a much lower affinity than Ec-PPase or other family I PPases
[unpublished data]. In the present work, we immobilized Mt-PPase on
NDs, evaluated the activity of the conjugates, and tested their performance
at high concentrations of Ca2+. We also characterized the
conjugates of Ec- and Mt-PPases enzymatically and physico-chemically
and tested the effects of other possible constituents of biological
tissues on their activity. Our in vitro tests demonstrate that the
conjugates of both enzymes are stable in pH range 5–10 and
retain significant PPase activity in the presence of high concentrations
of calcium and fluoride.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Covalent Immobilization of PPase
Earlier, we reported
the preparation of E. coli PPase (Ec-PPase)
covalently immobilized on ND-NH2 and
ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 retaining its high
enzymatic activity.31 However, Ec-PPase
is known to be completely inhibited by Ca2+ in vitro with
a micromolar inhibition constant.33 Thus,
the reliability of this model enzyme for the proposed in vivo applications
was not quite obvious because the levels of Ca2+ in tissues
may be too high for the efficient enzymatic function of Ec-PPase-based
conjugates. PPase from M. tuberculosis (Mt-PPase), on the other hand, binds Ca2+ with a significantly
lower affinity than Ec-PPase [unpublished data]. It was shown35 that Mt-PPase shares most of the basic features
of family I inorganic pyrophosphatases, including the catalytic residues
and mechanism. However, this enzyme has notable structural and functional
properties36 that allow Mt-PPase-based
conjugates to provide some resistance to Ca2+ inhibition
expected of Ec-PPase-based conjugates. With this in mind, we prepared
Mt-PPase covalently immobilized on ND-NH2 and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 and tested them, as well as Ec-PPase-based
samples.

Taking into account the general similarity of Mt-PPase
and Ec-PPase, we tested Mt-PPase immobilization using the previously
developed system of Ec-PPase immobilization.31 The enzyme was cross-linked to the amine-containing ND with glutaraldehyde
with the protection of the active site by the substrate (MgPPi), cofactor (Mg2+), and inhibitor (F–). The ratio of protein and ND concentrations, the concentration
of glutaraldehyde and compounds protecting the active site, and the
incubation and washing protocols were also the same as for Ec-PPase.
However, because of the possible differences between Mt-PPase and
Ec-PPase, it was necessary to characterize the resulting conjugates
and confirm that the enzyme retained its activity.

The characteristics
of the obtained samples are presented in Table 1. Mt-PPase immobilized
on ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 almost completely
retained the activity of soluble enzyme (95%), whereas conjugates
with ND-NH2 lost approximately 20% of the initial activity.
A similar pattern was observed earlier for Ec-PPase. Compared with
the Ec-PPase-based conjugates, Mt-PPase-based conjugates had a somewhat
lower protein content, and the enzymatic activities of the conjugates
were significantly lower because of the lower initial activity level
of soluble Mt-PPase used for immobilization. The particles of Mt-PPase-based
conjugates were significantly smaller than those of Ec-PPase-based
conjugates. For Mt-PPase, we did not observe aggregates greater than
approximately 1 μm in diameter.

The Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) results for samples of ND
and Mt-PPase individually and Mt-PPase conjugated to ND-NH2 are shown in Figure 1. The spectra of Mt-PPase and its ND conjugates of both types [ND-NH2 and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2] were
similar. The spectra show the preservation of key protein absorption
bands during immobilization: C=O, C–N stretching, and
N–H bending (“amide I” band at 1600–1700
cm–1); N–H deformation (“amide II”
band at 1510–1580 cm–1); and C–N stretching
(“amide III” band at 1200–1400 cm–1).37 Thus, the successful immobilization
of Mt-PPase on the surface of NDs can be confirmed.

onto ND-NH2 (3).

2.2 Catalytic Parameters of Immobilized PPases
Until date, several strategies involving various detection methods
have been proposed to determine PPase activity, the most recent strategy
being the quantitation of Cu2+ ions released from the Cu-PPi complex after PPi hydrolysis.38,39 In this work, we employed the conventional strategy of spectrophotometric
quantitation of Pi released from PPi by PPase,
which was applicable for both soluble and immobilized enzymes. PPase
activity was measured in a range of conditions as the initial rate
of Pi release with time. The catalytic parameters of Mg-activated
hydrolysis of magnesium pyrophosphate by immobilized enzymes were
determined. The activity profiles versus substrate concentration are
shown in Figure 2.
According to the linear character of the double reciprocal plots (Figure 2, insets), Michaelis–Menten
kinetics was observed for all the conjugates. The calculated Km and Vmax values
are given in Table 2.

Figure 2 Activity profiles of (a) Ec-PPase and (b) Mt-PPase immobilized
on ND-NH2 (1) and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (2). Lines are the best fit to the Michaelis–Menten eq 1. In the insets, same data
are presented in double reciprocal coordinates.

The pyrophosphatase activity
of the conjugates was preserved. However,
significant decreases in substrate affinity and the rate of hydrolysis
were observed in comparison with soluble enzymes. Nevertheless, the
values obtained for specific enzymatic activity were sufficiently
high to suggest that these conjugates could hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate
at concentrations expected in the synovial fluid of joints with various
pathologies (5.9–20.2 μM).40

Comparison of the catalytic parameters of Ec-PPase and Mt-PPase
conjugates showed that although the Ec-PPase-based conjugates were
more active, Mt-PPase-based conjugates had a higher affinity for the
substrate. The two enzymes showed similar patterns when immobilized
on ND-NH2 versus ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2: conjugates with ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 were more active, but they had higher Michaelis constants
than ND-NH2 conjugates. To sum up, both enzymes, Mt-PPase
and Ec-PPase, and both types of NDs are suitable for the preparation
of active conjugates.

2.3 PPase Activation by Mg2+
PPases are metal-dependent enzymes. For family
I PPases, the main
physiological cofactor is Mg2+.41,42 Therefore, we studied the effect of Mg2+ ions on catalysis
by soluble and immobilized enzymes. The result is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Activity dependencies
of (a) Ec-PPase and (b) Mt-PPase immobilized
on ND-NH2 (1) and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (2) on the concentration of Mg2+. Lines are the
best fit to eq S1.

Binding of two Mg2+ ions (at the M1 and M2 sites, which
differ in affinity) is necessary for enzyme activation. Binding of
only the lower-affinity Mg2+ ion at the M2 site can be
detected by PPase activity. The resulting hyperbolic profiles were
approximated using eq S1, corresponding
to the scheme of enzyme activation by binding of one Mg2+ ion. The calculated parameters are presented in Table 3. Amax is the maximal activity of the PPase at saturation with the cofactor,
and Kd is the dissociation constant of
the enzyme–magnesium complex at the M2 site. At these concentrations
of Mg2+, inhibition of PPases by the lowest-affinity Mg2+ at the M4 site36 was not observed.

 	immobilized on ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2	300 ± 40	0.29 ± 0.05	
These results show that immobilization of PPases does
not significantly
impair their affinity for Mg2+ at the M2 site. Most affected
is Mt-PPase immobilized on ND-NH2. Nevertheless, these
conjugates are highly active under the conditions expected for biological
samples (Mg2+ concentrations can reach 0.82 mM in the synovial
fluid).32

2.4 PPase
Inhibition by Fluoride Ions
Fluoride ions are well-known
inhibitors of family I PPases. Most
family I PPases are characterized by binding of F– with Kd in the micromolar range.43,44 It binds reversibly to an enzyme–substrate complex and competes
with the attacking nucleophile to block pyrophosphate hydrolysis.44 Because F– ions play an important
role in the processes of growth and renewal of bone and articular
tissues,45 we determined its effect on
the activity of soluble and immobilized PPases in vitro. Activity
profiles in the presence of F– are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Inhibition by F– ions of Mg2+-activated
hydrolysis of magnesium pyrophosphate by Ec-PPase (a) or Mt-PPase
(b) in the soluble form (1) or immobilized on ND-NH2 (2)
or ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (3). Lines are
the best fit to eq S2 with α = 0
(soluble Ec-PPase) or α ≠ 0 (all other PPases).

All tested PPases were fully or partially inhibited
by F–. The calculated inhibition parameters (inhibition
constant Ki, maximal activity A0, and limiting activity at saturation with
inhibitor A1 = αA0) are shown in Table 4. These results demonstrate
that all samples of Mt-PPase, including its soluble form, retain some
residual activity, approximately 10–20% of the initial value,
even at the highest concentrations of F– used in
the experiment (50 mM). Soluble Ec-PPase, as was reported earlier,46 is inhibited completely by F– with an inhibition constant of 0.1 mM. However, immobilized Ec-PPase
is not inhibited completely, demonstrating unusual behavior similar
to that of Mt-PPases. So far, incomplete inhibition of family I PPases
by the fluoride ion has not been reported. In general, the immobilized
forms of both PPases are more active at high F– than
the soluble forms.

2.5 PPase Inhibition by Calcium Ions
Ca2+ is
an effective inhibitor of family I PPases.33,47 According to the publication,34 normally,
a large amount of Ca2+ (up to 1.4 mM) is presented in synovial
fluid. In the present work, we determined the activity of immobilized
PPases in the presence of Ca2+ ions. The dependencies obtained
are presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Inhibition by Ca2+ of Mg2+-activated hydrolysis
of magnesium pyrophosphate by soluble enzymes (1) or those immobilized
on ND-NH2 (2) or ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (3), Ec-PPase (a) or Mt-PPase (b). Lines are the best fit
to eq S3 (soluble PPases) or (eq S2) (immobilized PPases).

All tested PPases were inhibited by Ca2+. According
to these data, in the case of Ca2+ inhibition, both samples
of soluble PPases were completely inhibited, while all samples of
immobilized PPases retained residual activity of 50% or more. This
effect is most unusual and has not been reported previously. The data
on immobilized enzymes were fitted to eq S2 for partial inhibition.

Unlike immobilized PPases, soluble
forms showed cooperative inhibition
(as reported in the paper,33 so the data
in this case were fitted to the Hill eq (S3, Supporting Information). The calculated inhibition parameters are shown
in Table 5. Parameter
α for the soluble PPases is 0, and the Hill coefficient h for the immobilized PPases is 1.

The immobilized PPases show the lower values of Ki compared to the soluble enzymes. This effect is most
obvious for the conjugates with ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2. However, because of incomplete inhibition, at high
concentration of Ca2+, the activity of immobilized PPases
remains high, while the activity of soluble PPases is almost completely
inhibited.

2.6 pH Dependence of the Activity
of Immobilized
PPases
As part of a general characterization of the catalytic
behavior of conjugates, the activity of immobilized PPases was determined
as a function of the pH of the reaction medium (Figure 6).

Figure 6 pH dependence of the activity of Ec-PPase (a)
or Mt-PPase (b) in
the soluble forms (1) or immobilized on ND-NH2 (2) or ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (3). Lines are the best fit to eq S4.

The dependencies obtained were bell-shaped with two asymmetrical
shoulders. All tested samples were active in the pH range 7.2–8.3,
which corresponds to the pH of most biological fluids, including synovial
fluid. At alkaline pH, all samples showed nonzero levels of activity
up to pH 12. For Ec-PPase and its conjugate with ND-NH2, the left branch of the plot shows a rapid drop in activity at acidic
pH, demonstrating the involvement of at least two protons in the observed
titration of catalytically important residue(s). The data were fitted
to eq S4 (Supporting Information). The
parameters obtained are presented in Table 6. A1 is the maximum
activity, A2 is the limiting level of
activity in the alkaline range, Ka1 and Ka2 are acidity constants of the catalytic groups,
and m and n are the numbers of titratable
protons in the acid and alkaline pH ranges, respectively.

The pH range of activity
and the pKa values of the titratable groups
are typical for family I PPases.35 After
protein immobilization, pH dependencies
change only marginally.

2.7 Stability of the PPase
Oligomer in Conjugates
as a Function of pH
In a previous paper,31 we demonstrated that Ec-PPase retained sufficient thermal
stability after immobilization. In the present work, we studied the
dependence of the activity of immobilized PPases on the pH of the
storage medium.

The stability of PPases at different pH values
is the result of pH-sensitive dissociation/association equilibrium
between various oligomeric forms of the protein.48 Family I PPases from bacteria under physiological conditions
are homohexamers organized into two trimers.49 The protein residues involved in intersubunit contacts differ considerably
between species. In Ec-PPase, the intertrimeric interface is stabilized
by ionic interactions while the contacts between the subunits of the
same trimer are mostly hydrophobic.49 The
native hexamer dissociates into a number of oligomeric forms depending
on the storage conditions, leading to loss of activity. The trimeric
form of Ec-PPase retains approximately 40% of the activity of the
hexamer, while the other oligomeric forms are virtually inactive.48 Therefore, storage conditions may be important
for retaining the active PPases. Immobilization of enzymes can cause
significant changes in the structure of their subunit interfaces,
which can be manifested in changes in the oligomeric equilibrium or
affect the catalytic characteristics of individual oligomeric forms.50

To address this problem, PPase samples
were incubated for 24 h
at different pH levels. Subsequently, aliquots were taken from these
solutions, and the PPase activity was measured under standard conditions
(pH 7.5, fixed concentrations of the cofactor and substrate). The
results are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7 pH dependence of the stability of Ec-PPase (a) and Mt-PPase
(b)
in the soluble forms (1) or immobilized on ND-NH2 (2) or
ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 (3). Lines are the
best fit to eq S5.

All the obtained pH-stability profiles are bell-shaped. The data
were fitted to eq S5 (Supporting Information). The obtained parameters are presented in Table 7. All samples of Ec-PPase are essentially
stable over a wide pH range of 5–11. For Mt-PPase and its conjugate
with ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2, the stability
range is narrow (5–8 for the soluble enzyme and 6–9
for the conjugate); however, this range is much wider for its conjugate
with ND-NH2 (5–11). The analysis of pKa values of the titratable groups responsible for the
transitions between the oligomeric forms (Table 7) shows that for Ec-PPase, immobilization
on ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 slightly changes
the pKa values of both acidic and basic
protein groups involved in stabilization of the hexamer, while immobilization
on ND-NH2 does not. The pKa values of the soluble Mt-PPase differ from those of Ec-PPase because
of significant differences in the oligomeric interfaces of these two
proteins.36 Immobilization of Mt-PPase
on both types of ND changes these values. The observed variations
in the pKa values upon immobilization
may stem from changes in the microenvironment of titrable groups involved
in the oligomeric interaction. Significant alterations in the shape
of the pH-stability profile observed for Mt-PPase immobilized on ND-NH2 may be due to the increased activity of the oligomeric form
prevailing at pH 10–12 (according to publication, it is a trimer).36

3 Conclusions
In this work, conjugates of inorganic pyrophosphatase from M. tuberculosis (Mt-PPase) with modified nanodiamonds
ND-NH2 and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 were synthesized using the protocol reported earlier for PPase from E. coli (Ec-PPase).31 New
Mt-PPase-based conjugates retain significant enzymatic activity toward
Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis of MgPPi. Both Ec-PPase
and Mt-PPase-based conjugates are stable and active in the wide pH
range (5–10), which makes them suitable pyrophosphate-hydrolyzing
agents for in vivo applications. Predictably, Mt-PPase-based conjugates
in the absence of inhibitors had lower absolute activity than Ec-PPase-based
conjugates, following the lower activity of soluble Mt-PPase. Also,
as expected, Mt-PPase-based conjugates had lower affinity to the known
inhibitors of PPases, calcium or fluoride, than Ec-PPase-based conjugates.
However, the interpolation of the inhibition profile to the higher
concentrations of inhibitors shows incomplete inhibition (immobilized
Mt-PPase retained up to 40% in the presence of Ca2+ or
15% in the presence of F–). The most unexpected
result was that Ec-PPase, in the immobilized form, in contrast to
the soluble form, also showed incomplete inhibition by either F– or Ca2+. The incomplete inhibition of Family
I PPases by these ions was found for the first time. Both these ions
are considered to be catalytic mechanism-based inhibitors: Ca2+ replaces the catalytic Mg2+ ions, and F– replaces the attacking nucleophile.

The results of this study
demonstrate that both PPase-based conjugates
retaining some PPase activity in the presence of F– or Ca2+, constituents of major human tissues, have potential
for the hydrolysis of t-CPPD under physiological conditions. However,
their activity is yet to be demonstrated in more complex biological
systems. To sum up, the PPase-based conjugates suggested here can
be a step toward a solution to the challenging problem of managing
CPP-related arthropathies.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
Recombinant inorganic pyrophosphatase
from E. coli (Ec-PPase) was obtained
and purified, according to ref (49) and recombinant inorganic pyrophosphatase from M. tuberculosis (Mt-PPase), according to ref (36). The enzymes were stored
at 4 °C as suspensions with ammonium sulfate (90% saturation).
Immediately before testing, the enzymes were desalted by gel filtration
on a column with Sephadex G-50 Fine in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, with 5
mM MgCl2. The concentrations of soluble proteins were determined
using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden),
using the mass extinction coefficients of 1.1825 and 0.9835 for Ec-PPase and
Mt-PPase, respectively. The initial catalytic activity was about 800
U mg–1 for soluble Ec-PPase or about 300 U mg–1 for soluble Mt-PPase.

The original UDA-TAN
ND obtained by the detonation synthesis method was purchased in the
powdered form from the Federal State Unitary Enterprise “SKTB
Tekhnolog” (St. Petersburg, Russia). Samples of aminated NDs
were obtained using the procedure described previously31 by reducing the original ND sample with hydrogen,
followed by chlorination and amination with gaseous ammonia (ND-NH2) or covalent modification using hexamethylenediamine [ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2]. ND surface modification was
checked at each stage of the synthesis using FTIR spectroscopy and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, hydrosols with particle
sizes of 70 and 50 nm for ND-NH2 and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2, respectively, were prepared from aminated
NDs. The concentration of hydrosols was determined by gravimetry.
The concentration was 7.3 mg mL–1 for ND-NH2 and 5.9 mg mL–1 for ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2. The particle size in hydrosols was
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS).

The chemicals
were purchased from Sigma (USA), Fluka (Switzerland),
Merck (Germany), and Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Sweden) and used without
further purification. Deionized water was purified to an impedance
value greater than 18 MΩ cm–1 using a Milli-Q
plus system (Millipore).

4.2 Covalent Immobilization
of Inorganic Pyrophosphatases
on NDs
Mt-PPase and Ec-PPase covalently immobilized on ND-NH2 and ND-NH-(CH2)6-NH2 were
obtained according to the method described previously for the Ec-PPase
procedure.31 Briefly, a solution of PPase
(1.0 mg mL–1) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing
5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF, 100 μM Na4P2O7, hydrosol of aminated NDs (1 mg mL–1), and glutaric aldehyde CH2(CH2CHO)2 (50 or 500 μM) was shaken for 1 h at 20 °C. The solid
phase and the supernatant were separated by centrifugation (14,000
rpm, 10 min). The concentration of protein in the supernatant was
determined. The solid phase containing the immobilized PPase was collected
and repeatedly washed with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 5 mM MgCl2, with shaking for 10–15 min, until complete absence of protein
in the supernatant. The protein content in the conjugates (mg PPase
per mg ND) was determined from the data obtained on the total collected
supernatant. In further experiments, to recreate the required protein
concentration in the mixture, conjugates were added until the required
immobilized protein amount (mg) per mixture volume (mL) was reached.

4.3 Characterization of ND-PPase Conjugates
4.3.1 Infrared Spectroscopy with Fourier Transform
Infrared
(IR) absorption spectra were measured in KBr tablets using
an FTIRS Nicolet IR200 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) with
a resolution of 2 cm–1 in the range of 400–4000
cm–1. Each experiment consisted of 100 scans.

4.3.2 Dynamic Light Scattering
Determination
of the particle size and ζ-potential by DLS was performed using
a ZetaSizer Nano ZS ZEN 3600 (Malvern instruments, USA). The minimum
volume of the investigated solution was 0.5 mL.

4.3.3 Determination of Hydrolytic Activity of
PPase
The catalytic activity of PPase (Ec-PPase or Mt-PPase)
was determined at 20 °C as the initial rate of phosphate production
from pyrophosphate. The reaction mixture contained buffer solution
(50 mM Tris pH 7.5), 100 μM MgPPi as a substrate,
and 5 mM Mg2+ as a cofactor. The reaction was started by
the addition of 0.2–1.5 μL of the PPase sample (either
solution or hydrosol) to 25 μL of the reaction mixture to a
final protein concentration of 0.1–0.4 μg·mL–1. After 30 s, reaction was stopped by the addition
of 80 μL of malachite green dye reagent containing ammonium
molybdate, HCl, polyvinyl alcohol, and sodium citrate,51 and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured using
a Victor Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). The phosphate
concentration was determined according to the Pi standard
curve. Specific activity of PPase was presented as U mg–1. A value of 1 U mg–1 equals hydrolysis of 1 μmol
of substrate per minute by 1 mg of the enzyme.

Raw data were
approximated by the corresponding equations using SigmaPlot for Windows,
version 10.0 (Systat Software Inc.).

4.3.4 Catalytic
Parameters of Magnesium Pyrophosphate
Hydrolysis
To determine the catalytic parameters of MgPPi hydrolysis, Vmax and Km, PPase activity was measured as described
above, at 5 mM Mg2+, in a range of substrate concentrations
(0–180 μM MgPPi) and at a final protein concentration
of 0.1 μg mL–1. The dependence of activity
on the concentration of MgPPi was processed by nonlinear
regression according to the Michaelis–Menten equation 1  where V is the initial
rate
of MgPPi hydrolysis, Vmax is
the maximum rate of the enzymatic reaction, Km is the Michaelis constant, and S0 is the initial concentration of the substrate.

4.3.5 Effect of Cofactor Metal Ions
To
study the effect of magnesium ion concentration, PPase activity was
measured as described above, at 100 μM MgPPi, 0–3
mM Mg2+, and at a final protein concentration of 0.4 μg
mL–1. The dependency of activity on Mg2+ concentration was processed by nonlinear regression using eq S1,36 corresponding
to Scheme S1 (Supporting Information).

4.3.6 Analysis of the Inhibition of PPases by
Fluoride or Calcium Ions
To study inhibition by fluoride
and calcium ions, PPase activity was measured as described above,
at 100 μM MgPPi, 2 mM Mg2+, and a final
protein concentration of 0.2–0.4 μg mL–1. The reaction mixture additionally contained one of the inhibitors
in a range of concentrations (either 0–150 mM NaF or 0–5.5
mM CaCl2). The dependency of PPase activity on F– or Ca2+ concentrations was processed by nonlinear regression
using eqs S2 or S3 (Scheme S2, Supporting Information), as described in the
text.43

4.3.7 pH
Dependence of Conjugate Activity
Solutions of PPase (Ec-PPase
and Mt-PPase) or hydrosols of covalently
immobilized PPase (final protein concentration 0.2–0.4 μg
mL–1) were added to the reaction mixture containing
50 mM buffer solution with pH 1.6–12.6 (HCl–KCl pH 1.6,
Na citrate pH 2.6–4.6, MES-KOH pH 5.6–6.6, Tris-HCl
pH 7.5–8.6, CAPSO pH 9.6, CAPS pH 10.6, or NaOH–KCl
pH 11.6–12.6), 100 μM MgPPi, and 2 mM Mg2+, and the activity of PPase was measured as described above.
The dependencies of activity on pH were processed by nonlinear regression
using the eq S4 corresponding to Scheme
S4 (Supporting Information).36

4.3.8 pH Dependence of PPase
Oligomer Stability
in Conjugates
Solutions of PPase (Ec-PPase and Mt-PPase)
or hydrosols of covalently immobilized PPase (final protein concentration
0.2–0.4 mg mL–1) were incubated for 24 h
at 4 °C in 50 mM buffer of the corresponding pH in the range
of 1.6–13.6, containing 3.2 mM Mg2+. The buffers
used were HCl–KCl pH 1.6, Na citrate pH 2.6–3.6, Na
acetate pH 4.0–4.5, Na cacodylate pH 5.0, MES-KOH pH 5.6–6.6,
Tris-HCl pH 7.3–8.6, CAPSO pH 9.6, CAPS pH 10.6–11.0,
and NaOH–KCl pH 11.6–13.6. After incubation, aliquots
of samples were added to 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 100 μM
MgPPi to a final protein concentration of 0.2–0.4
μg·mL–1, and the PPase activity was measured
as described above. The dependencies of activity on pH were processed
by nonlinear regression using eq S5 corresponding
to Scheme S5 (Supporting Information).36
