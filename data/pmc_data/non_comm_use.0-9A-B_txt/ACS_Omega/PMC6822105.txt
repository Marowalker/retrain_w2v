A newly designed mixed-ligand coordination
polymer [Zn4(bdc)4(ppmh)2(H2O)]n (1) (H2bdc =
1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid, ppmh = N-pyridin-2-yl-N′-pyridin-4-ylmethylene-hydrazine)
has been characterized using different physicochemical techniques.
The structure has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction
measurements. There are two pyridyl-N and one hydrazino-imine-N donor
centers in ppmh, where two pyridyl-Ns bind simultaneously
to two Zn(II) to serve as a bridging agent to form a coordination
polymer. The 1,4-benzene dicarboxylato (bdc) is ligated
via the aromatic dicarboxylato-O to form a one-dimensional (1D) chain.
These two 1D chains about Zn(II) constitute a two-dimensional structure,
which undergoes noncovalent interactions (C–H···π
and π···π) to generate a three-dimensional
supramolecular assembly. Electrical conductivity of 1 is higher by 1 order (1.37 × 10–6 S/cm) than
that of the free ligand, ppmh (6.2 × 10–7 S/cm). Especially, the responsivity of the compound 1 was 56.21 mA/W, which is 11 times higher than that of the ligand ppmh (5.12 mA/W). The specific detectivity of the compound
was 2.17 × 1010 Jones, which is also almost 10 times
higher with respect to the specific detectivity of the ligand-based
device (4.53 × 109 Jones). The results show that the
compound can be valuable for optoelectronic fields. The biological
studies suggest that compound 1 is antibacterial as well
as a promising anticancer agent (LD50, 42.2 μg/mL
against HepG2 cells), while ligands remain silent. Investigation of
the mechanism of the cell killing activity of compound 1 accounts the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species.

==== Body
Introduction
Zinc is known for many
centuries as one of the versatile metals
and plays vital roles in the growth of civilization and industrial
applications.1−3 It is useful in corrosion resistance, painting, in
battery, energy storage, etc. A Zn(II) ion (d10) is redox-innocent,
has closed cell electronic configuration, and is diamagnetic, and
its abundance is next to iron, in living beings.4 Many researchers are now engaged in designing coordination
polymers (CPs)/metal organic framework (MOF), where Zn(II) is used
as a metal knot with the coordination of organic linkers like carboxylates,
N-heterocycles, imines, azophenols, etc.5−13 Thus, a linker may generate coordination polymers (CPs). The wide
range of interest in these materials is due to their esthetic structural
diversity, high thermal and chemical stability than that of simple
coordination complexes, photochemical and electrochemical applications,
high conductivity, etc.12−26 Because of the electrical and photoelectrical properties, some of
them are useful materials for electronic devices.8

Recently, our research group has reported a number
of coordination
polymers (CPs) using dicarboxylato ligands as linkers for Schottky
diode applications.27−31 Ambitious applications of dicarboxylato Zn(II)-MOF in different
prospective fields have stimulated us to design some newer molecules
for exploration of new activities. Herein, we report a Zn(II)-based
CP, [Zn4(bdc)4(ppmh)2(H2O)]n (1); the compound 1 shows Schottky diode barrier (SDB) activity (conductivity:
6.2 × 10–7 S/cm for N-pyridin-2-yl-N′-pyridin-4-ylmethylene-hydrazine (ppmh) and 1.37 × 10–6 S/cm for the compound 1); and the electrical conductivity is enhanced on irradiation
of light. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the optimized
geometry of the compound has been attempted for the explanation of
the electronic and conducting features. Interestingly, the compound, 1, shows considerable antibacterial activity [IC50, 190 ± 2.4 μg/mL (Escherichia coli) and IC50, 185.96 ± 3.04 μg/mL (Staphylococcus aureus)] along with anticancer activity.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Descriptions
The ligand, ppmh, crystallized by slow evaporation of methanol solution
belongs to
a monoclinic system and space group P21/n with Z = 8. The condensation
of −CHO and −NH2 has been supported by the
presence of C=N, N(5)–C(5) 1.273(2) Å (Figure 1 and Table S1). The presence of noncovalent interactions
(C–H···π, π···π)
makes the structure of the molecule robust. There are π···π
interactions (3.806 Å), CH···π interactions
(2.826 Å) (CH···π 147.5°), and H-bonding
interactions (2.227 Å, 175.28°) (2.57 Å, 160°)
shown in Figure S1.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of ppmh.

The crystal structure of [Zn4(bdc)4(ppmh)2(H2O)]n (1) is monoclinic crystal system
having the space group P21 with Z = 2. The square pyramidal unit
of the coordination entity is shown in Figure 2, and the selective bond parameters are listed
in Table S2. The asymmetric unit contains
four Zn(II) centers that are assigned as Zn01, Zn02, Zn03, and Zn04.
The pairs of Zn(II) centers Zn01, Zn03 and Zn02, Zn04 are equivalent.
Zn01 is bonded to one ppmh and three bdc ligands; ppmh is just appended from the metal center,
and bdc acts as a bridging motif via chelation and in a rectilinear
fashion. The Zn02 center is chelated by the two N-donor centers (pyridyl-N,
imine-N) from a ppmh ligand and coordinated from another ppmh, and two bdc ligands bind in a monodonating
fashion. Thus, Zn01 forms ZnO4N and Zn02 forms ZnN3O2 coordination arrangements. The bond lengths
Zn01–O(bdc) lie in the accepted range (Zn01–O1,
1.997(7) Å; Zn01–O8, 2.533(9) Å; Zn01–O9,
1.975(8) Å, and Zn01–O15, 1.984(8) Å; and Zn01–N2,
2.035(8) Å).

Figure 2 Asymmetric unit of metal organic polymeric compound 1.

These bond parameters support
the distorted geometry around the
central metal ion. The above-described coordination unit undergoes
repetition to form a polymeric structure (Figure 3). The polymerization has taken place via
coordination of bdc and propagates in two directions,
and from the ppmh ligand, it has extended to form a polymer.
The higher dimension of the molecule has also been prompted by different
interactions (Figure 4).

(b) Supramolecular
assembly of compound 1.

However, the phase purity of the powdered sample of crystalline ppmh and compound 1 has been verified by powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The simulated (at room temperature) and
as-synthesized PXRD patterns are well matched, which supports the
purity and consistency of the bulk material used for application purposes
(Figure S3).

Optical Analysis
UV–vis absorption analysis
of the thin film of the materials was done to analyze the extent of
light absorption as well as to determine the band gap of the material.
The UV–vis absorption spectrum (250–900 nm) is shown
in Figure 5. It can
be seen from the figure that the compound 1 shows higher
absorbance than ppmh.

Figure 5 UV–vis absorption spectra of compound 1 and ppmh.

The band gap of the materials has been calculated from Tauc’s
plot following αhν = A(hν – Eg)n, where h denotes
the Planck constant, α signifies the absorption coefficient,
ν symbolizes the photon frequency, A represents
a constant, Eg indicates the optical band
gap, and n = 1/2 (for direct transition). Tauc’s
plot for the materials is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Tauc’s plots for (a) ppmh and (b) compound 1.

The band gap for ppmh is found to be 3.28 eV, and
the band gap of compound 1 is 3.13 eV. The lower band
gap and higher absorbance capability of compound 1 indicate
its better potential for photosensitive device application.

There are two types of ligands, symmetrical dicarboxylato bdc2– and antisymmetric N-pyridin-2-yl-N′-pyridin-4-ylmethylene-hydrazine (ppmh) coordinated to Zn(II). The structural distortion mainly arises
from the coordination of the N-donor (ppmh) ligand to
Zn(II). The bond parameters are as follows: Zn–N(pyridyl):
Zn02–N5, 2.045/Zn04–N8, 2.038; Zn–N(hydrazino):
Zn02–N3, 2.441; Zn04–N6, 2.452 Å. Thus, hydrazino-N
is weakly bonded with Zn(II) and is sensitive to light irradiation.
There are some examples of photoisomerization of Zn(II)-arylazoheterocycles,
which undergo cleavage of the Zn–N(azo) bond upon light irradiation.32−34

The same idea may be extended to the example where the increased
structural distortion by enhancing the Zn–N (hydrazino) bond
length upon light irradiation causes increment of conductivity. This
distortion may reduce the band gap and increases photoconductivity.
The energy gap is the major parameter determining conductivity or semiconductivity of a material; if it
is decreased to 4 eV, semiconductivity is observed. In addition, the
conjugation in compound 1 decreases the energy gap between
the conduction and valence bands. Thus, charge transfer possibility
increases. The geometric pattern and proper orientation in the compound 1 can lead to intermolecular interactions (e.g., π–π
stacking, etc.) assisting efficient charge transfer within compounds.35

I–V Measurement and
Analysis
The I–V curves of the devices made from ppmh (Figure 7a) and the compound 1 (Figure 7b) under
dark and light conditions have shown rectification, which implies
the formation of a Schottky barrier diode (SBD). The conductivity
of ppmh is found to be 6.2 × 10–7 S/cm and is increased to 1.37 × 10–6 S/cm
for the compound 1. The increased conductivity of the
compound 1 can be supported by the band gap values of
the materials, which are less than those of the free ligand, ppmh. Also, the compound-based SBD has shown better rectification
behavior (Table 1)
compared to the ligand-based device. The on/off ratio of the SBD fabricated
with compound 1 is 93, whereas it is 32 for ppmh.

Figure 7 I–V characteristic curves
for (a) ppmh and (b) compound 1 under dark
and light irradiation.

a Note: S = photosensitivity, R = responsivity, D* = specific detectivity, n = ideality factor, Rs = series
resistance, ϕb = Schottky barrier height.

The photoresponse of the devices
is important to assess their application
potential in optoelectronics. Thus, transient photocurrent measurement
was also done for the SBDs under 1.5 G light illumination (100 mW/cm2), and the corresponding result is shown in Figure 8. The transient light-induced
current response is measured by switching the light on and off at
an interval of 60 s for 600 s. As can be seen in Figure 8, the devices show good photoresponse
upon irradiation of light. The photocurrents are steady and reproducible
for several switch on–off cycles. The response is rectangular,
which indicates the efficient movement of excited electrons to the
external circuit. However, the response speed is better for compound 1-based SBD compared to ppmh-based SBD. Most
importantly, the device fabricated with compound 1 has
shown much higher photoresponse behavior compared to the free ligand, ppmh. The higher photoconductivity of the compound 1 can be explained using UV–vis absorption spectra and band
gap analysis. The enhanced light absorption and smaller band gap of
compound 1 resulted in better photoconductivity of the
compound 1-based Schottky diode.

Figure 8 Transient photocurrent
response of the ligand ppmh and compound 1.

The photosensitivity (S) has been calculated from eq 1 1  where IPh = IL – ID (IL is the current generated
on light irradiation
and ID is the current obtained in the
dark) is the photocurrent.37,38 Photosensitivity of
the ppmh-based SBD diode is 9.98, whereas it is 20.95
for the compound 1. The figure of merit of the SBD as
a photodetector can be assessed by its responsivity (R) (eq 2)36−39 and specific detectivity (D*). The responsivity
was measured from 2  where PIn is incident
optical power per unit area and A is the area of
the diode. The responsivity of the compound 1 is 56.21
mA/W, which is 11 times higher than that of the free ligand ppmh (5.12 mA/W). We also measured the specific detectivity
of the devices using eq 3(36,37) 3  where q denotes the charge
of electron and ID denotes the dark current.
The specific detectivity of the compound 1-based SBD
is about 5 times higher in magnitude than that of the ppmh-based SBD. The results indicate that the synthesized compound 1 has better potential for photodetector and other optoelectronic
device applications.

The diodes are further analyzed by thermionic
emission theory of
Schottky diode (eq 4)36−40 4  where I indicates the forward
current, I0 means the reverse saturation
current, V denotes the applied bias, q denotes the electronic charge, k denotes the Boltzmann
constant, and T denotes the absolute temperature; n signifies the ideality factor, a constant considered for
nonideal behavior of the diode. Representation of I0 can be done by eq 5(40) 5  where A, A*, and ϕb signify the effective
diode area, Richardson
constant, and Schottky barrier height, respectively. The effective
diode area was 7.065 × 10–6 m2.

Determination of the ideality factor, series resistance, and barrier
height of a Schottky diode is necessary to assess the device performance.
These parameters have been derived from Cheung’s eqs 6–840−42 6   7  and 8  where Rs signifies
the series resistance of the diode. The dV/dln(I) versus I and H(I) versus I plots are portrayed in Figure 7. The series resistance
and ideality factor are calculated from the slope and y axis intercept of the dV/dln(I) versus I graph, respectively. The y axis intercept of the H(I) versus I graph is used to determine the barrier height of diodes.
The series resistance is also determined from the slope of the H(I) versus I graph.

The ideality factor (Table 1) for both devices is deviated from unity. This refers to
the mixed interface of the metal–semiconductor (MS) junction
and trapping states in the interfacing layer, which acts as a localized
generation–recombination center.37−40 Other causes may be the bias
dependency on the barrier height, the presence of a thin native oxide
layer at the interface, and electron tunneling within the barrier.37−42 Upon illumination, the ideality factor approaches unity, which means
improvement in junction quality. For the complex-based SBD, the ideality
factor is closer to 1, implying better metal–semiconductor
junction formation. Series resistance (Rs) yielded from two methods (i.e., Rs derived
from the slope of dV/dln(I) vs I and H(I) vs I graphs) (Figure 9 and Table 1) was pretty much consistent, and Rs of
compound 1-based SBD is much lower with respect to the
series resistance of the ppmh-based device.

Figure 9 dV/dln(I) vs I and H(I) vs I curves for ppmh-based SBD under (a) dark and (b) light
conditions; compound 1-based SBD under (c) dark and (d)
light conditions.

The Schottky barrier
height is another pivotal factor for evaluation
of the performance of a Schottky diode. The barrier heights for ppmh- and compound 1-based SBDs under dark are
estimated as 0.65 and 0.60 eV, respectively (Table 1). Under light irradiance, these values were
0.61 and 0.58 eV, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the barrier height of compound 1-based SBD is a bit smaller than that of the SBD based on ligand ppmh, which indicates its fast switching action.

To
analyze the charge transport characteristics of the devices,
we performed impedance spectroscopy. The Nyquist plots for both the
devices are shown in Figure 10. The figure displays that the diameter of the semicircle
for the compound 1-based SBD is much smaller, implying
reduced charge recombination and faster charge transfer in compound 1-based SBD compared to those in the ppmh-based
device, resulting in higher current and better performance of the
device. (Figure S4).

Figure 10 Nyquist plots for both
the devices: ppmh and compound 1.

DFT Computation and the Band Gap
In the present study,
lattice matching and
deformation potentials have been utilized to acquire the Schottky
electrical contact, where energy difference within the conduction
and valence bands is referred to as the deformation. In a single molecule,
ΔE (=ELUMO – EHOMO, eV) is very useful. The optimization of
structural geometry of the ligands (H2bdc and ppmh) has been performed. In the case of network compounds,
the absolute deformation potentials are required to determine the
band gap, which influences
the electronic features of metal and ligands. In the coordination
compounds of the d10 metal ion system, the band edges are
usually explained via the electronic state of the ligands and the
geometric pattern of the framework. The
optimized structure of the coordination unit of CP is needed to calculate
ΔE (Figure 11), which correlates with the band gap found from Tauc’s
plot.

Figure 11 DFT-computed energy of molecular orbitals and the energy difference
between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of H2bdc, ppmh, and compound 1.

The energy values of HOMO and LUMO of the compound 1 are −6.44 and −3.23 eV, respectively. The energy difference
is 3.21 eV. Again, the calculated band gaps of 3.97 eV (HOMO = −6.00
eV and LUMO = −2.03 eV) for ppmh and 4.88 eV (HOMO
= −7.58 eV and LUMO = −2.70 eV) for H2bdc are higher than those for the compound 1 (Figure 11). Thus, it is
quite clear that the compound 1 is relatively higher
conductive than the component ligands. In the irradiation condition,
this theoretical view has a good agreement with the experimental one.
The time-dependent (TD)DFT table is shown in the Supporting Information (Table S3). In ppmh, an intense band can be seen at 378 nm, which
may be due to the HOMO-to-LUMO transition. In compound 1, the transition
is shifted to a longer wavelength, 396 nm, which can be assigned to
the HOMO-to-LUMO + 1 transition

Biological Study
Antimicrobial
Activity and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement
One
of the recent and promising applications of coordination polymers
or metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is the exploration of biomedical
activity.43 Hydrazones display diversified
biology-related activities, viz., anticancer, antimicrobial, antidepressant,
anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, analgesic, antimalarial,
antifungal, antitubercular, antiviral, cardio-protective, etc., and
establish an important class of compounds for development of latest
drugs.44  The ligand N-pyridin-2-yl-N′-pyridin-4-ylmethylene-hydrazine
carries an imine, −CH=N–, function and has potential
pyridyl-binding sites to capture and penetrate the cell wall, has
affinity to H+-binding, shows coordination with metal ions,
and can disrupt the protein structure through noncovalent interactions.
Hence, ppmh and its complexes have endogenous bioactive
motifs that may be useful in examining their antimicrobial activity.
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been evaluated by the
microdilution method in Luria broth according to the reported protocol.43−46

The in vitro cytotoxicity of H2bdc, ppmh, and the compound 1 has been estimated
for checking the cytotoxic effects on the HepG2 cell line. The treatment
of cells was performed with five different concentrations (20, 40,
60, 80, 100, and 120 μg/mL) for 24 h, followed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The cell viability assay (Figure 12) reports that the % survivability of cells
is decreased in parabolic dependence with increasing concentration
of the coordination polymer 1 with an LD50 value of 42.2 ± 2.3 μg/mL, while H2bdc and ppmh do not show any impact at any concentration
(up to 120 μg/mL) on the growth states of cells. We have taken
cisplatin as the positive control whose LD50 value is 12.6
± 2.8 μg/mL. This implies the compound 1 is
active against the HepG2 cell line and comparatively less toxic and
cheaper than cisplatin. To check the leaching of Zn2+ from
the compound 1 in the solution phase during biological
studies, the 1H NMR spectra of 1 in the solvent dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 are recorded even
after 24 h; the spectra do not display any change. This implies that
the compound 1 is stable in solution (Figure S7).

Figure 12 Cell viability assay of H2bdc, ppmh, and compound 1 on human liver cancer cells,
HepG2.

The profile of inhibition of H2bdc, ppmh, and compound 1 has been presented in Figure 13. From the result,
it is evident that the ligands have insignificant impact on the bacterial
growth, while the compound 1 shows a concentration-dependent
decrease in the growth of both types of bacteria. In the case of E. coli, the IC50 is 190 ± 2.4 μg/mL,
and S. aureus shows IC50 of 185.96 ± 3.04 μg/mL. We have taken ampicillin as positive
control whose IC50 values are 56 ± 1.9 μg/mL
for E. coli and 42 ± 2.8 μg/mL
for S. aureus. Thus, Zn(II) coordination
polymer, i.e., compound 1, is more efficient than its
ligands H2bdc and ppmh.

(SD). * Represents P value < 0.05, ** represents P value < 0.01, and *** represents P value < 0.001.

Induced intracellular
oxidation, superoxide formation, and the
oxidative stress in both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria
have been detected using ROS measurements. The intracellular ROS level
is proportional to the intensity of fluorescence activity.

Normally,
the 2,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA)
goes into the cell as well as reacts with the reactive oxygen to display
a green fluorescent compound, dichlorofluorescein (DCF). In summary,
a stock solution of DCF-DA (10 mM) was prepared in methanol and was
further diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a working
concentration of 100 μM. Treatment of HepG2 cells was performed
with the compound at LD50 for 12 h at 37 °C, followed
by rinsing with ice-cold 1× PBS and incubation with 100 μM
DCF-DA for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity
was estimated both spectroscopically (Hitachi, Japan) and under a
fluorescence microscope in HepG2 cells (Leica, Japan) at excitation
and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively.

To
understand the mechanism of the inhibition of the growth of
bacterial cells, the intracellular generation of ROS inside the bacterial
cells was tested. The ROS production was measured by utilization of
DCF-DA [intracellular ROS indicator for the compound 1-treated bacterial cells (Figure 14)]. The results suggest that the compound 1 causes significant increase in the generation of the intracellular
ROS in the case of both E. coli and S. aureus cells, which ultimately results in the
bacterial cell death. The production of ROS along with DCF fluorescence
intensity was similar in both types of bacteria. Thus, this study
depicts the antibacterial ability of compound 1 involving
the production of intracellular ROS. More ROS generation implies maximum
cell death. This intracellular ROS production disturbs the electron
transport chain within the cell, fragments genetic materials, and
damages the bacterial cell membrane.46−48 This happens probably
due to the effective penetration of compound 1 into the Enterococcus faecalis cells, which inhibits the bacterial
cell growth and serves as an antibacterial agent.

Estimation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
performed using
both fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorometry where 2,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA) served as a specific probe. The determination of
reactive oxygen production is done in HepG2 tumor cell lines after
the treatment of cells with compound 1, at their respective
LD50 dose for 12 h. The fluorescence microscopic images
reveal that the green color fluorescent intensity is increased for
both treated cells compared to control cells in HepG2 cell lines after
12 h (Figure 15).

Anticancer Activity
Despite a notable
improvement in
the ground of cancer diagnosis and treatment, cancer is a growing
threat to the world. Furthermore, due to high side effects caused
by most promising chemotherapy, metastatic cancer needs more effective
chemotherapeutics to minimize these problems. Again, the global dissemination
of resistant bacterial strains is one of the most serious present-day
challenges in hospital-acquired infections, which needs to be taken
care of in a more economical and healthy way.

Compound 1 has shown to be a potential antibacterial agent against
Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive
(S. aureus) bacterial species. In the
present experiments with compound 1, destruction of bacterial
cell wall might have caused due to one or multiple steps of signaling
cascades, resulting in defective cell wall synthesis or impaired cross-linking
of polymer units, which occur due to the ROS generation in both Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the compound 1 enhanced cellular ROS in human liver cancer cells, which in turn
culminates in the death of cancer cells. In conclusion, our study
shows that the Zn(II) coordination polymer 1 is not only
an effective antibacterial drug but also appears as a promising anticancer
drug, which can be a subject of further detailed studies.

Conclusions
Keeping in mind the energy crisis and human
health, multifunctional
three-dimensional Zn(II)-MOF presented in this work may be a potential
candidate to solve the problems. Pyridylhydrazone and 1,4-benzene
dicarboxylic acid (H2bdc) both serve as bridging
agents to bind Zn(II) and have been characterized by single crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). This molecule undergoes higher dimension from the combination of arrangement of organic ligands
and different supramolecular interactions mainly H-bonding and π···π
interaction. Fascinatingly, the molecule shows enhancement of electrical
conductivity under light conditions. Thus, the compound may be a useful candidate for optoelectronic
device fabrication. The biological application of the coordination
polymer shows effective antibacterial and anticancer activity. Thus,
our compound may be considered as an active member in the class of multifunctional
materials.

Experimental Section
Materials and General Methods
All
of the chemicals
used during this experiment purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
were of reagent grade and were utilized without any purification in
laboratory. Elemental analysis (C, H, N) was performed by a PerkinElmer
240C analyzer. A PerkinElmer spectrometer (Spectrum Two) was used
during the Fourier transform infrared spectral measurement with the
samples following the attenuated total reflectance technique. Thermal
analysis was carried out on a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond thermogravimetry/differential
thermal analysis in the temperature range between 30 and 600 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The PXRD data of the grinded sample was
collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.548 Å) produced at 40 kV and 40 mA and
was recorded in a 2θ range of 5–50.

The impedance
measurement of the given samples as a function of frequency (40 Hz
to 11 MHz) utilizing a computer-controlled Agilent make precision
4294A LCR meter. The electrical characterization was carried out via
a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter, interfaced with a personal computer.
Solid-state UV–vis spectroscopy was performed via a PerkinElmer
UV–vis Lambda 365 instrument. For solid-state UV–vis
spectroscopy, ppmh and compound 1 were dissolved
in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at
0.2 mM concentration and sonicated for 15 min. Then, a thin film of
each was deposited over a glass plate and dried in vacuum for 1 day.
After 1 day, UV–vis spectra have been recorded (Figure S7).

Thiazolyl blue formazan (MTT)
and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCF-DA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and Luria–Bertani (LB) broth were obtained from HiMedia
Pvt. Ltd., India, and ethanol and glutaraldehyde from Merck, India. E. coli DH5 (MTCC-1652) and S. aureus (MTCC 25923) were obtained from the Institute of Microbial Technology,
Chandigarh, India. Throughout the experiment, Millipore water was
used. The in vitro cytotoxicity of ppmh and the compound 1 was estimated for checking the cytotoxic effects on the
HepG2 cell line. The cells were treated with five different concentrations
(20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 μg/mL) for 24 h followed by the
MTT assay. H2bdc, ppmh, and the
compound 1 were dispersed in 1% DMSO to form a dilute
suspension of 2 mg/mL using a bath sonicator for 30 min. When these
were entirely dispersed in water, the average particle diameter and
size distribution of microspheres were determined by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) utilizing Zetasizer (NANO ZS90, Malvern Instruments
Ltd., U.K.).

Synthesis of Compound
N-Pyridin-2-yl-N′-pyridin-4-ylmethylene-hydrazine
(ppmh)
4-Pyridine carboxaldehyde (214 mg, 2
mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of MeOH with a few drops of AcOH and stirred
for 30 min. Then, 2-hydrazinopyridine (218 mg, 2 mmol) was slowly
added in stirring conditions, and stirring was carried out for 1 h.
The mixture was refluxed for 24 h followed by cooling; yellow rod-shaped
crystals appeared in the solution. Crystals were filtered and washed
with Et2O. They were then dissolved in hot minimum volume
of MeOH to recrystallize by slow evaporation. Rod-shaped yellow crystals
were then separated; yield, 90% (356 mg). IR: 1610–1720 cm–1 aromatic region, 1298 cm–1 C=N,
2856 cm–1 C–H, 3130–3300 cm–1 N–H (Figure S5). Elemental analysis

H: 5.08, N: 28.26. found: C: 66.60, H: 5.00, N: 28.34. 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 is given in Figure S6.

[Zn4(bdc)4(ppmh)2(H2O)]n (1)
Methanolic
(2 mL) solution of ppmh (39.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) was slowly
layered to a solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (60 mg, 0.2 mmol) in water (2 mL) utilizing buffer solution
of MeOH and H2O, 1:1 (v/v, 2 mL) followed by layering of
H2bdc (33.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) neutralized with
Et3N (0.021 g, 0.2 mmol) in EtOH (2 mL). Brown crystals
of [Zn4(bdc)4(ppmh)2(H2O)]n were obtained after 3 weeks (163.4
mg, yield 60%). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C54H36N8O19Zn4: C: 47.60; H: 2.66;
N: 8.22; found: C: 47.52; H: 2.73; N: 8.19. IR: 1559 cm–1 C=N, 1620 cm–1 C=O, 3564 cm–1 N–H, 2826 cm–1 C–H
(Figure S5). And in case of free H2bdc the major peaks are obtained at 1782 cm–1 for acidic C=O group, 3250 cm–1 O–H, 1550–1650 cm–1 for aromatic
region, which confirms the binding mode of H2bdc in compound. NMR spectra of compound 1 in DMSO-d6/D2O mixture (1:10 v/v) is shown
in Figure S6.

Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) (30–600 °C, under an inert N2 atmosphere):
It shows first breaking of compound at 105 °C, indicating loss
of water from the crystalline compound followed by characteristic
weight loss at 200 °C. Thus, this long range of thermal stability
supports the framework stability and applicability of the material
in the field of electrical conductivity for compound 1. The
TGA plots of compound 1 and ppmh are shown
in Figure S8a,b, respectively, which shows
the extreme level of thermal stability.

X-ray Crystallography
Yellow single crystal of ppmh and brown single crystal
of the compound 1 were used for data collection using
a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer
equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å). Data collection parameters and crystallographic
data are listed in Table 2. The molecular structure has been solved using the SHELX-97
package.46 Non-hydrogen atoms of the compound
were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The unit cell parameters
and crystal-orientation matrices of the compound were determined by
least-squares refinement of all reflections within the hkl range −18 < h < 18, −18 < k < 15, −16 < l < 16. The
intensity data were amended for Lorentz and polarization effects.
Crystal data were collected applying the condition I > 2σ(I). Hydrogen atoms of this molecular
system were placed in their geometrically idealized positions and
constrained to ride on their parent atoms. Selected bond lengths of ppmh are given in Table S1. Selected
bond lengths and bond angles of compound 1 are listed
in Table S2. The crystallographic data
for ppmh and compound 1 are summarized in Table 2.

Computational Method
The structural optimization of
full geometry of the compound 1 and ligand (H2bdc and ppmh) was performed utilizing density
functional theory (DFT) with the GAUSSIAN-09 program package. The
SCXRD coordinates of ppmh and compound 1 were used in the calculation. During the theoretical calculation,
a hybrid level DFT-B3LYP was used. The basis set LanL2DZ was exploited
for all of the elements including Zn(II) in the metal organic network
compound and ligand systems.48−53 To denote the different important electronic transitions
based on B3LYP/B3LYP optimized geometry were theoretically computed
for the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) formalism.
The vibrational frequency calculation was also implemented for these
three compounds to ensure that the DFT-optimized geometries represent
the local minima and there were only positive eigenvalues. The fractional
contribution of different molecular orbital components present in
the molecule was calculated via Gauss sum operation47−57 (Tables S3–S5).

Schottky Device
and I–V Measurements
To fabricate the Schottky devices, first,
the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate was cleaned by 2-propanol,
acetone, and distilled water sequentially and repeatedly by ultrasonication
bath for 20 min, and the Schottky device was fabricated by the as-synthesized
compound 1 sandwiched between indium tin oxide (ITO)
and metal (Al). The solution of compound 1 was prepared
in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by
the ultrasonication technique. Then, it was spin-coated on a precleaned
ITO-coated glass substrate (at a spinning speed of 600 rpm for 1 min)
to produce a thin film via an SCU 2700 spin-coating unit. This spin-coating
step was repeated four times followed by drying under vacuum conditions.
For the characterization of the prepared thin film, the thickness
was measured by the surface profiler at 1 μm. An aluminum (Al)
electrode was deposited on the active film to construct the metal–semiconductor
(MS) junction by the thermal evaporation technique via a vacuum coating
unit (12A4D HINDHIVAC) under 10–6 Torr pressure,
and the effective diode area was maintained as 7.065 × 10–6 m2 with a shadow mask. Current–voltage
(I–V) measurements of the
devices were performed in the voltage range −1 to +1 V with
a Keithley 2635B sourcemeter under dark and light conditions.37 Every measurement was carried out at normal
temperature and under ambient conditions. To measure the conductivity
of the materials, the Ohmic electrode was deposited on the material
and the I–V measurement was
done. The conductivity was measured from the slope of the resultant I–V graph.

Antimicrobial Activity
The antibacterial activities
of H2bdc, ppmh, and the compound 1 were studied43−45 against Gram-positive bacteria, S.
aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, as standard. In brief, 10 μL of the
bacterial strain containing 2.5 × 105 colony forming
unit (CFU)/mL bacteria was separately added to 1 mL of Luria–Bertani
(LB) broths with different concentrations of ppmh and
compound 1. For preparation of a pure suspension of compound 1, the samples were sonicated in a bath-type ultrasonicator.
Here, the pure suspension acts as a dissolved solution, accurately
reflecting the amount of particles available in solution to attack
microorganisms. Several concentrations of 1 were added
to the bacterial media containing the bacterial strains followed by
incubation for 24 h. After that, the MIC values were obtained by inspecting
the turbidity of the bacterial growth. The values correspond to 99%
inhibition of bacterial growth. All assays were performed in a biosafety
cabinet. All of the experiments were triplicated to obtain the standard
deviation. The antibacterial effect is calculated using M% = B – C/B × 100, where M denotes the mortality rate
(%), B denotes the mean number of bacteria in the
control samples (CFU/mL, where CFU signifies the colony forming unit),
and C denotes the mean number of bacteria on the
treated samples (CFU/mL).

Bacterial ROS Measurement
A fluorescent
dye, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA, Sigma), was utilized as an indicator of ROS generation.
A fresh broth (4 mL) was inoculated with approximately 104 CFU/mL
for overnight culture and treated with different concentrations of
compound 1 (10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL, respectively),
while the untreated sample was kept as control at 37 °C for 1
h. Following this, 10 μM dichlorofluorescein diacetate was added
to the bacterial cell suspension and incubated for 30 min in the dark
to record the fluorescence intensity in a microplate reader (BioTek,
Germany) with excitation and emission at 504 and 529 nm, respectively.

Cell Line Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay
Human liver
cancer cells (HepG2) were obtained from the National Center for Cell
Science Pune, India. The growth of cells was performed in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin
(100 units/mL) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All of the treatments
were executed at 37 °C and at a cell density allowing exponential
growth.

On exposure to various concentrations of ppmh and compound 1, the viability of HepG2 cells was determined
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay.36 In summary, around 1 ×
104 cells per well of 96-well plates were exposed to the
compounds at different concentrations
of untreated as control samples, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μg/mL
for 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following
this, the cells were incubated again with 10 μL of MTT solution
(stock 1 mg/mL) for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 following
a wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the formazan
crystals were dissolved in MTT solubilization buffer to measure the
absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad). The data
were formulated comparing with the control ones.
