Rare
earth Nd3+ ion-doped Ca12Al14O33 single crystals were grown at a rate of 1 mm/h by
the floating zone technique in an oxygen atmosphere. The Nd concentration
in the central area of the as-grown crystals was higher than that
in the peripheral area due to the highly concave growth interface
shape. The average Nd concentration in the as-prepared parallelepiped
slices of ∼6 × 3 × 2 mm3 for electride
fabrication was ∼0.093 ± 0.011 atom % Nd in contrast to
the nominal 0.1 atom % Nd concentration. The Nd-doped C12A7:Nd single
crystalline electride prepared by thermal treatment with a Ti metal
at 1100 °C for 48 h induced an insulator–metal transition
with the highest conductivity of approximately 1165 S/cm. These annealing
conditions provide an approach to completely remove clathrated oxide
ions from the crystallographic cages, leading to the formation of
C12A7:Nd(e–) and C12A7:e– electrides with high-density electrons
(∼2.4 ± 0.2 × 1021 and ∼1.8 ±
0.1 × 1021 cm–3) localized in the
cages. The carrier mobility at room temperature in C12A7:Nd(e–) was very similar to that in C12A7:e–, even though it was very high at temperatures
below ∼150 K.

1 Introduction
Light
metal oxide 12CaO·7Al2O3 (abbreviated
as C12A7) has attracted attention for use in functional ceramics.
The crystal structure of C12A7 is cubic with a unit cell composed
of a positively charged lattice framework [Ca24Al28O64]4+ and two extraframework oxide ions (called
free O2– ions) that compensate the positive lattice
framework.1−3 C12A7 can be regarded as a clathrate compound due
to its three-dimensionally connected subnanometer-sized cage structure.4 It is also known as a novel functional material
with applications in oxidation catalysis, fuel cells, hydrogen storage,
and CO2 capture due to its high ionic conductivity.5−7 On the basis of the recent studies, outstanding properties can arise
through the substitution of the free oxide ions in the cages by various
anion species,8−15 even though C12A7 is a stable ceramic that is well known as a constituent
of aluminate cements. The replacement of the electrons for the free
oxide ions in C12A7 was carried out by several thermal treatments,
such as Ca or Ti metal vapor treatments,16,17 and electron carrier generation was also performed by oxide ion
reduction in C12A7 under a CO/CO2 atmosphere.18 In the chemical reduction processes, four electrons
are injected into 4 of the 12 cages by extracting two of the O2– ions to compensate for the positive charge in the
crystallographic cages. The insertion of the electrons into
subnanometer-sized cages gives rise to the conductive properties of
C12A7 (labeled as C12A7:e–), which
shows a persistent insulator–semiconductor,17 insulator–metal-superconductor19 conversion as the electron concentration (Ne) is increased. Kim et al. synthetically achieved the
presence of persistent solvated electrons in C12A7:e– in high-temperature melts and glasses.20 However, theoretical studies,21−25 as well as experimental research,26 have revealed that the three-dimensionally connected cages
form an additional conduction band known as the cage conduction band
(CCB) in the bottom of the framework conduction band. Because of the
low electron concentration in the cages, conduction occurs through
the hopping of the electrons from a localized deformed cage to the
CCB. The electron-doped C12A7:e– electride is stable under ambient conditions,10 and it has recently been used in electronic devices as
an electron-emitting source or a low electron injection barrier due
to its combination of a low work function (∼2.4 eV) comparable
to that of the potassium metal and chemical inertness that is in contrast
with the reactive nature of potassium.26 In addition, the C12A7:e– electride
can be used as a cathode material in organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs), as an electrode in fluorescent lamps, as a chemical reducing
reagent, for ammonia synthesis,27,28 and so on.

The
effect of cationic substitution on the structure and electrical
properties of C12A7 is much less known than that of anionic substitution.
Bertoni et al. investigated Mg substitution in the Ca(12–x)MgxAl14O33 system and found that electrical conductivity was decreased.29 They also studied a Si-substituted Ca12Al(14–x)SixO(33+x/2) structure that catalyzes
hydrocarbon decomposition at high temperatures.30,31 Stefan et al. grew C12A7 single crystals with the substitution of
1 mol % Fe in the Al site by the floating zone (FZ) method, obtaining
a reduction of the electrical conductivity relative to that of C12A7:e–.32 However,
the framework and channel modifications in the mayenite Ca12Al14O33 nanocages were investigated theoretically
by cationic doping.33

To the best
of our knowledge, to date, trivalent cation substitution
in the Ca sites of a C12A7 single crystal has not been studied yet.
The substitution of trivalent cations into the divalent Ca2+ sites in C12A7 is one possible method for doping a high density
of electrons by neutralizing the increased positive charge within
the lattice framework. We previously studied the solid solubility
limit of rare earth ions (Y3+, Ho3+, Eu3+, and Nd3+) into the C12A7 phase by the FZ technique,
and maximum solubility was found for Nd.34 The present work reports C12A7 single crystal growth by the FZ method
with 0.1 atom % Nd substitution in the Ca site, the electride fabrication
of the as-grown single crystal with optimum annealing conditions,
and investigations of the electrical conductivity, carrier concentration,
and carrier mobility of the as-prepared electrides.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Growth
The neodymium-doped
C12A7:Nd single crystals were grown with a nominal concentration of
0.1 atom % Nd, as shown in Figure 1A. Before the C12A7:Nd single crystal growth, we also
grew a nondoped transparent C12A7 single crystal (see Figure S1d). The as-grown C12A7:Nd crystal is
transparent and bluish in color. The bulk XRD pattern along the growth
direction is shown in Figure 1B. The reflection peaks were identified as (332) and (664).
The presence of this single family of peaks confirms the single domain
nature of the grown crystal; it was also found that the growth direction
was slightly tilted by approximately 1.63° from the ⟨111⟩
direction. The regular and periodic set of the Laue reflection points
pattern also confirms the single crystallinity.

single crystal (A) and bulk X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the crystal grown along the growth direction (B).
The crystal was cut cross-sectionally along the growth direction necessary
for performing the bulk XRD measurement.

2.2 Neodymium Distribution in As-Grown Single
Crystals
Figure 3 shows the Nd concentration distribution in the as-grown crystal
measured by using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The Nd concentration
was not uniform along the radial direction as shown in Figure 3A. The Nd concentration in
the central region is higher than the nominal concentration of 0.1
atom % Nd, whereas the Nd concentration in the peripheral area is
very low compared to the nominal concentration. This inhomogeneity
of the Nd distribution may be due to a highly concave shape of the
growth interface (shown in Figure 2A). Because of the concave interface shape, the crystallization
starts from the peripheral area and proceeds toward the center. Consequently,
if the crystal growth starts along the growth direction from time t1 to t2, the crystallization
occurs along the radial direction from the peripheral area at time t1 to the central area at time t2 as shown in Figure 2B. This means that the crystallization starts in the
peripheral area earlier than in the central area. Because of the highly
concave growth interface and a low effective distribution coefficient
of Nd (∼0.14),34 the Nd dopant in
the diffusion layer in the melt is concentrated as a normal freezing
process during crystallization from the peripheral area to the central
area. Consequently,
the Nd concentration is very high at the central area in contrast
to that in the peripheral area and is even higher than the nominal
concentration. The Nd concentration along the longitudinal direction
in the as-prepared parallelepiped slice was estimated to be 0.093
± 0.011 atom % by EPMA as shown in Figure 3B. The Nd distribution
inhomogeneity along the growth direction was low as compared to that
in the radial direction. This
result agrees with our previous reported results that the Nd concentration
along the vertical growth direction in the central and the peripheral
areas was not significantly changed, in contrast to the results observed
in the radial direction.34 Therefore, we
have prepared the parallelepiped-shaped slice for the electride fabrication
by cutting the crystal neither exactly in the central area nor exactly
in the peripheral area but in between as indicated by the red line
in Figure 3A. In a
similar manner, we have prepared several parallelepipeds of approximately
6 × 3 × 2 mm3 slices for annealing.

2.3 Electrical Conductivity
of Single Crystal
Electrides
Because of the annealing of C12A7:Nd single crystals
at 1100 °C for 36–72 h, the color of all samples changed
from transparent bluish to black (see Figure S1). The nondoped sample also became black after the annealing at 1100
°C for 48 h. The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity
of the C12A7:Nd single crystals annealed at 1100 °C for various
annealing times is shown in Figure 4A. The conductivity (300–2 K) increases as the
annealing time increases from 36 to 48 h and decreases for the further
increase of the annealing time up to 72 h, with the highest conductivity
at 300 K found for the Nd-doped sample annealed for 48 h (sample c). At a temperature range lower than ∼150 K, the conductivity
for sample c was very high compared to that of all other
samples except for the Nd-doped sample annealed for 72 h (sample e). This may be due to the high electron density (∼2.4
× 1021 cm–3) over the cages in the
C12A7:Nd single crystal electride.

48 (c), 60 (d), and 72 (e) h annealed at 1100 °C. (B) Arrhenius
plot of the corresponding C12A7 and C12A7:Nd single crystal electrides.

However, in the case of the long
(more than ∼48 h) annealing
process at 1100 °C, the sample becomes more brittle, and the
sample thus showed an increased tendency to break during the removal
of the TiO2 layer that completely covered the sample surface.
The out-diffusion of the free oxide ions from the crystallographic
cages during the annealing is continued despite the formation of a
thick titanium oxide layer over the sample’s surface, which
is advantageous in contrast to the Ca-metal treatment.18 Furthermore, the long-time annealed sample may
contain some cracks and may partly decompose in several places, making
holes/voids on the surface as is evident from the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image and compositional analysis using EPMA (shown
in Figure 5A,B). Because
of these holes and cracks, the conductivity decreased drastically
to an even lower value than that for the nondoped sample and became
almost constant even at very low temperatures of up to 2 K. Thus,
it is shown that a 48 h annealing time is expected to be optimal at
1100 °C. To optimize the annealing temperature, we measured the
conductivity of the C12A7:Nd single crystals annealed at 900–1200
°C for 48 h of the annealing time (see Figure S2).

72 h with cracks and holes/voids created in the decomposed places
of the surface during polishing to remove the titanium oxide layer
(A, B). The sample and the SEM image of the sample annealed at 1200
°C for 48 h (C, D).

Figure 4B
shows
the Arrhenius plot of the electrical conductivities (σ) of Ti-heated
single crystals annealed for 36–72 h at 1100 °C. The Arrhenius
plot has no negative slope, indicating no thermally activated mechanism
through variable range hopping conduction, and the electron concentration
is higher than 1 × 1021 cm–3.18 In contrast, we have obtained positive slopes
for all annealed samples resulting in the insulator-to-metal transition.
In all conductive samples, log σ is exponentially increased
up to ∼50 K and becomes almost constant and insensitive to
temperatures below ∼50 K.

The sample annealed at 1200
°C for 48 h was very brittle,
and its color changed to yellowish in contrast to black as shown in Figure 5C. The color change
may be due to the decomposition to another phase instead of C12A7
confirmed by the compositional analysis using EPMA. The SEM image
of the sample annealed at 1200 °C for 48 h (Figure 5D) also shows many cracks.
Therefore, the Ti-metal vapor treatment for 48 h at 1100 °C would
be the optimum annealing condition for C12A7:Nd single crystals for
obtaining the highest conductive electrides.

Room temperature
(RT) conductivity σ300 K of C12A7:Nd single
crystals annealed at 1100 °C for 48 h (sample c)
showed a maximum value of approximately ∼1165 S/cm,
compared to that of samples on which other annealing conditions were
applied as well as nondoped C12A7 (sample a) as shown
in Figure 6. For the
long annealing of more than ∼60 h (Figure 6A), the obtained RT conductivity decreases
sharply. The RT conductivity was not significantly changed in the
36–60 h range of annealing times, and the doping electron concentration
(∼2.3 ± 0.2 × 1021 cm–3) for 36 h annealed at 1100 °C (sample b) was also
nearly equal to that of sample c (2.4 ± 0.2 ×
1021 cm–3) (shown in Table 1), indicating the complete replacement
of the free O2– ions by the electrons. Further,
at 900 °C (sample f), 1000 °C (sample g), and 1100 °C (sample c) and an annealing
time of 48 h, the RT conductivity was slightly changed (Figure 6B), even though the carrier
concentration in the corresponding samples was significantly lower
than that for the annealing temperature of 1100 °C (sample c) (Table 1).

Figure 7 shows the
resistivity curves (ρ–T) for the nondoped
and Nd-doped single crystal electrides, wherein the sample annealed
at 1100 °C for 48 h (sample c) shows the lowest
resistivity. In the low-temperature range of below ∼100 K,
ρ is governed because of the electron–electron interaction
that follows the ρ – ρo α Tn law with n ∼ 2 (see Figure S4). In contrast, at temperatures greater
than ∼100 K, the resistivity follows the ρ – ρo α Tn law with n ∼ 1 (see Figure S5), wherein resistivity
is controlled by the phonon scattering. ρo is the
temperature-independent residual resistivity observed at temperatures
lower than ∼15 K, which may be due to the imperfection of the
crystals. These resistivity characteristics agree with the previously
reported results.18 Similar resistivity
behavior was observed for samples f and g (see Figure S3).

Figure 7 Electrical resistivity
(ρ) of the samples a, b, c, and d linearly increases with
increasing temperature and follows the ρ – ρo α Tn law with n = 2 at lower temperatures of below ∼100 K resulting in typical
metals.

2.4 Carrier
Concentration and Mobility
The electron density introduced
in the cages and the carrier mobility
were investigated using Hall coefficient measurements. In the Hall
coefficient measurement, a four-point probe was set up around the
perimeter of the sample. When the magnetic flux through the sample
and the current along the length of the sample are applied perpendicular
to each other, a Hall voltage, VH, that
is perpendicular to both the magnetic flux and the current is developed.
The Hall coefficient, RH, can be calculated
using the equation 1  where d is the sample thickness, B is the magnetic field, I is the electrical
current, q is the charge of the carrier, and Ne is the carrier density. In our experiment,
we measured the resistance, R = VH/I, of the sample for the magnetic field
varying between ±9 T. The measured resistance was plotted as
the ordinate against the magnetic field as the abscissa. The multiplication
of the slope of the plot and the sample thickness gives the Hall coefficient
value. Using this Hall coefficient value, we calculated the carrier
concentration, Ne, of the annealed samples
(Table 1). The carrier
mobility, μH, was calculated by using the equation 2  where ρ is the resistivity of the sample.

Figure 8 shows the
data for carrier concentration Ne and
carrier mobility μH at RT (300 K) of the as-prepared
C12A7:Nd(e–) and C12A7:e– single crystal electrides. The standard
deviation for the measurements of carrier concentration and carrier
mobility in sample d is very high because of the partial
decomposition in part or microcracking during removal of the titanium
oxide layer. The maximum carrier concentration corresponding to Ne ∼ 2.4 ± 0.2 × 1021 cm–3 was found for sample c annealed
at 1100 °C for 48 h, which is consistent with the theoretically
calculated value of ∼2.37 × 1021 cm–3. This implies the removal of ∼100% of the clathrated oxide
ions from the crystallographic cages, leading to the formation of
the complete electride, C12A7:Nd(e–). The carrier concentration of sample b is almost equal
to that of sample c (Figure 8A and Table 1), indicating the nearly complete replacement of the
free oxide ions by the electrons, whereas the carrier mobility of
sample b is lower than that of sample c.
It was found that the carrier mobility in C12A7:Nd(e–) tends to increase with increasing annealing
time, whereas the carrier concentration in C12A7:Nd(e–) is independent of the annealing time below 60
h. However, for the annealing time of 48 h, the carrier concentrations
in samples f and g that annealed at 900
and 1000 °C were lower than that in sample c that
annealed at 1100 °C, even though the carrier mobilities in the
corresponding samples were almost the same (Figure 8B).

Figure 8 (A) Carrier concentration (closed circles and
triangle) and mobility
(open circles and triangle) of C12A7:e– (a) for 48 h and C12A7:Nd(e–)
for 36 h (b), 48 h (c), and 60 h (d) annealed at 1100 °C. (B)

(c) for 48 h.

The lower carrier concentration
than that of sample c annealed at 1100 °C for 48
h indicates that some free oxide
ions still remain inside the crystallographic cages. The carrier mobility
in C12A7:Nd(e–) and C12A7:e– for the annealing time of 48 h at 1100
°C at RT was quite similar, whereas the carrier concentration
in C12A7:Nd(e–) was very high,
implying a higher electrical conductivity with respect to C12A7:e–. However, the carrier mobility in C12A7:Nd(e–) and C12A7:e– increased with decreasing temperature from 300 to 2 K and increased
sharply below ∼150 K in C12A7:Nd(e–) for the annealing time of 48 h at 1100 °C (see Figure S6).

For the C12A7:e– electride,
our measured carrier concentration and carrier mobility values were
∼1.8 × 1021 cm–3 and ∼3.02
cm2 V–1 S–1, respectively,
consistent with the previously reported values of ∼2.0 ×
1021 cm –3 and ∼4 cm2 V–1 S–1.10,18 However, in the previously reported work,10,18 the optical spectra, different annealing conditions, and different
measurement environment were used to measure the carrier concentration
and carrier mobility. In addition, for the Hall effect measurement,
the sample should be homogenous, crack-free, and hole-free and must
exhibit a uniformly thick flat shape, possibly giving rise to the
difference in the measurement results.

3 Experimental
Section
Single-phase polycrystalline 12Ca1–xNdxO·7Al2O3 powder was prepared by solid-state synthesis from γ-Al2O3 (99.99% purity, Taimei Chemical Co., Japan),
CaCO3 (99.99% purity, Rare Metallic Co., Japan), and Nd2O3 (99.9% purity, Rare Metallic Co., Japan) powders
in a stoichiometric ratio. The powders were mixed with the appropriate
amounts of ethanol using a mortar and pestle. The obtained powder
mixture was calcined for 12 h at 1200 °C in an O2 atmosphere.
The synthesized product was checked by powder XRD for phase purity,
and no secondary phases were detected in the product. To make the
feed rod, the fine powder was placed in the rubber tube and pressed
under a hydrostatic pressure of 300 MPa and subsequently sintered
at 1300 °C for 12 h in an oxygen atmosphere to obtain the high-density
feed rod.

The crystal growth was performed by using an optical
floating zone
furnace (FZ-T-10000-H-III–VPS-YT; Crystal Systems Inc., Japan)
equipped with four 1000 W halogen lamps as the heat source. The growth
conditions were as follows: a growth rate of 1 mm/h, a growth atmosphere
of 0.1 MPa oxygen, feed and seed rotation rates of 25 rpm, and a growth
direction of ⟨111⟩. The crystals were cut using a diamond
wheel saw and polished with 1 μm diamond dispersion. The neodymium
content along the growth and radial directions of the polished single
crystal slice was measured by EPMA. The growth direction of the as-grown
crystal was determined using a bulk single crystal XRD pattern. For
the resistivity and Hall coefficient measurements, the as-grown crystal
was cut into several parallelepiped slices with dimensions of approximately
6 × 3 × 2 mm3. For annealing, the amount of Ti
metal taken was in a weight ratio of 10:1 gm of Ti metal to the sample
in a quartz tube under vacuum. The as-prepared slices were annealed
at 900–1200 °C for 36–72 h to obtain optimum conditions.
The annealed samples were Pt-coated at the Ohmic contact junctions
for the resistivity and Hall coefficient measurements. The direct-current
resistivity and Hall coefficient were characterized by the physical
properties measurement systems with four probe orientations. The resistivity
was measured as a function of the temperature in the 2–300
K range. Hall coefficient measurements were performed at RT under
the external magnetic field in the range of ±9 T. Using the measured
value of the Hall coefficient, we determined the carrier density and
mobility in the Nd-doped single crystal electrides labeled as C12A7:Nd(e–) and in nondoped C12A7:e–.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the Nd-doped C12A7:Nd single crystals were grown
by the FZ method, and the electrical properties of the electride-treated
C12A7:Nd single crystals were characterized. An inhomogeneous Nd distribution
along the radial direction was observed, which is likely due to the
highly concave growth interface shape. There is further room for the
flat or convex growth interface shape to obtain a uniform dopant distribution.
The Ti-metal vapor annealing treatment was optimized at 1100 °C
for 48 h for which the highest electrical conductivity (∼1165
S/cm) and carrier concentration (∼2.4 ± 0.2 × 1021 cm–3) values were obtained. This high
electron density in C12A7:Nd(e–) is quite similar to the theoretically calculated value (∼2.37
× 1021 cm–3), indicating that all
clathrated oxide ions were removed from the crystallographic cages
through electron doping. The RT carrier mobilities in C12A7:Nd(e–) and C12A7:e– were the same (∼3.04 cm2 V–1 s–1), in good agreement with the previous report,10,18 even though it increases rapidly in the low-temperature region (<150
K) for the C12A7:Nd(e–) annealed
at 1100 °C for 48 h.
