The pyrolysis of
1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) is the most popular commercialized
way of producing vinyl chloride monomers (VCM); however, it is plagued
by high-energy consumption and the resulting coke formation. Here,
a series of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) activated carbon catalysts (N-AC)
were prepared conveniently for EDC dehydrochlorination. The structural
and textural properties of N-doped catalysts were characterized by
X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra,
temperature-programmed desorption of VCM and EDC, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. The results revealed that doping N into activated carbon
supports introduced basicity sites and caused partial graphitization
on the catalyst surfaces. Thus, an improved absorption capacity to
EDC and VCM and an accelerated desorption rate were obtained, which
greatly enhanced EDC conversion and VCM selectivity. EDC was almost
completely dehydrochlorided into vinyl chloride at a temperature of
300 °C and an EDC liquid hourly space velocity of 0.313 h–1. The high catalytic activity and selectivity as well
as good stability suggested that the N-AC catalyst would be a promising
dehydrochlorination catalyst on an industrial scale.

1 Introduction
Poly(vinyl
chloride) (PVC) is one of the most widely used plastic
in the world. PVC’s monomer, vinyl chloride monomers (VCM),
is commercially produced by acetylene hydrochlorination on an HgCl2 catalyst1,2 or by pyrolysis of 1,2-dichloroethane
(EDC).3 Acetylene hydrochlorination is
a main process in coal-rich countries; however, due to the high toxicity
of mercury, huge environmental pressure has been exerted on this route,4−6 especially since the implementation of Minamata Convention on Mercury.7 EDC pyrolysis is a dominant commercialized way
in the west, in which oil-based ethylene is used as the raw material.
Now with the shale gas development and the decline of oil price, EDC
pyrolysis has been more competitive in the preparation of VCM.

EDC pyrolysis runs at a temperature of about 500 °C and gives
a reasonable conversion of 50% and VCM selectivity of 98% on an industrial
scale.8 However, there is a problem of
coke formation which is believed to be caused partly by the pyrolysis
of EDC itself via acetylene through its radical chain conversion.9,10 This problem interrupts the long-term industrial operation and requires
decoking treatment every 2 months by burning coke deposit. Therefore,
it is vital for EDC dehydrochlorination to develop an active, selective,
and stable catalyst which can work in much lower temperatures and
result in less coke deposition.

To explore suitable catalysts,
a wide range of materials have been
investigated for their catalytic performance in dehydrochlorination.
Activated carbon (AC) supported with alkaline earth metals or transition
elements were extensively studied from the 1940s. It has been firstly
reported that BaCl2/AC can catalyze the dehydrochlorination
of 2,3-dichlorobutane to 2-chlorobutene at 215–235 °C,
but it gets deactivated in few hours.11 Subsequently, CuCl3, CaCl2, LaCl3, and other metal chlorides supported on AC have also been extensively
explored as dehydrochlorination catalysts.12−17 Other acidic and basic catalysts, such as Al2O3, silica–alumina, ZSM-5, SAPO, polyacrylonitrile-based activated
carbon fibers, and so on, have been applied in the reaction,8,18−21 too. Moreover, phosphonium chloride ionic liquid medium has also
been used as both a solvent and catalyst to the reaction in a bubbling
tank reactor.22

In the last 10 years,
our group have done much work on the green
production of VCM. We have developed an industrial transformative
technology for VCM synthesis (called the J-ZH VCM process in China),
in which acetylene and EDC are highly efficient and atom economically
coupled to VCM over a bifunctional BaCl2/N@AC catalyst.23−26 Now, 200 000 t/year VCM industrial demonstration line based
on the new catalytic process is under construction in De Zhou, Shan
Dong province, China.  In the J-Zh VCM process, the elimination of
HCl from EDC and the addition of HCl to acetylene occur in situ. N-Doped
activated carbon catalyzes acetylene hydrochlorination and EDC dehydrochlorination
at the same time.

In fact, in recent years, N-doped carbon materials
have been explored
as novel basic catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination,2,27,28 although they have also been
reported as efficient catalysts for EDC dehydrochlorination, such
as N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon and N-doped coconut activated
carbon.29,30 Although it has been claimed that N-doped
carbon materials are effective dehydrochlorination catalysts, it is
still a great challenge to develop a reliable and facial fabrication
method of N-doped carbon catalysts for EDC dehydrochlorination on
an industrial scale.

Based on these considerations and inspired
by the J-ZH VCM process,
in this investigation, we demonstrate a very convenient and stable
method to prepare N-doped activated carbon catalysts using poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
K-30 (PVP) as the N source and try to explore its performance in the
elimination of hydrogen chloride from EDC as a basic catalyst. Careful
characterization of the prepared N-AC catalyst, as well as systematic
investigation of the activity and stability on dehydrochlorination
reaction were carried out. Based on the present study, the correlation
of the catalytic activities with their texture and structural properties
was attempted to build. The fine catalytic performance and the available
prepared method suggested that N-AC would be a potential dehydrochlorination
catalyst on an industrial scale.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of N-AC Catalysts
To investigate the textural properties
of the obtained catalysts,
N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal analysis was
performed. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and the corresponding pore size distributions (PSD) on the surface
of the N-AC catalysts are shown in Figures S1 and S2. The pore structure parameters of the samples are shown
in Table 1. Clearly,
all samples exhibited type-I adsorption–desorption isotherms
at low partial pressures (P/P0 < 0.2) and type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherms
at higher partial pressures (0.2 < P/P0 < 0.9). The results indicated the coexistence of
micropores and mesopores in the catalysts. The specific surface area
and total pore volume of samples decreased significantly as a function
of increasing amount of PVP added. When the PVP/AC mass ratio reached
16%, the specific surface area of the sample reduced to 645.5 m2 g–1, and the pore volume was only 0.31
cm3 g–1. The results indicated that nitrogen
had successfully doped within the micropores and mesopores on the
AC surface altering the textural properties.

c Pyridinic and graphitic N.

XPS measurement was performed to
further distinguish the chemical
valence of nitrogen on the surface of the catalysts and N bonding
configuration in N-AC. As shown in Figure 1a, the spectra of the N-doped catalysts showed
a peak at ∼400 eV, which was assigned to the N 1s photoelectron
excitation and absent in AC supporter, demonstrating the successful
incorporation of nitrogen into the AC surface. Moreover, the N content
of N-AC, shown in Table 1, increased obviously with the PVP/AC mass ratio. Figure 1b shows the valence states
of N species in the N-AC catalysts. Clearly, there were three nitrogen
species coexisting in the obtained N-AC samples. The distinct peak
at a binding energy of 398.6 eV was assigned to pyridinic N, the other
two peaks at 400.9 and 403.2 eV were assigned to graphitic N and nitrogen
oxide,31 respectively. Noticeably, although
N was originated from PVP in which N is in a C–N five membered
ring, no distinctive sp3 pyrrolic-N, which should be presented
at about 400.2 eV, was observed in N-AC samples.30 This was probably because pyrrolic-N could be converted
into pyridinic- and graphitic-N at the elevated carbonization temperature,25 as shown in Figure S3. Because of similar bond lengths of C–N (1.41 Å) and
C–C (1.42 Å) in sp2 hybridized hexagonal ring,32 the N dopants in N-AC should exert less impact
on the planar structure of the samples.

Figure 1 (a) XPS data of the N-AC
catalysts and AC and (b) high-resolution
XPS N 1s spectra of N-AC catalyst samples.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of N-AC are shown in Figure 2a. Clearly, two broad
peaks were observed at ∼24.6 and ∼43.1°, which
were corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of a typical graphite
structure. The small peak at 26.6° should be attributed to silica,
which was not completely washed away by acid-treatment in the AC supporter.
The high-resolution electron micrograph of the typical catalyst sample
N-AC(4) is shown in Figure 2b. As shown in Figure 2b, two different carbon structures were distinctly observed.
One was amorphous carbon, the other was the crystal lattice planes
associated with the typical graphite structure.35,36 The results indicated that surface graphitization over the N-doped
AC samples occurred.33,34

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns of AC-N(x) samples and (b) the
high-resolution electron micrograph of N-AC(4).

Raman spectra shown in Figure 3 were performed to verify the influence of the N-dopant
on the interfacial carbon structure. Clearly, there were two explicit
Raman bands. The Raman peak at about 1590 cm–1 was
due to the G-band and the other peak at 1335 cm–1 was due to the D-band.36,37 Compared with the AC
supporter, the high-temperature-treated samples including N-AC(0),
N-AC(4), and N-AC(8) showed narrower full width at half maximums and
deeper valleys between the two bands, which indicated the structural
change of graphite during the high temperature treatment process.36 However, for these sintered samples, the intensity
ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) slightly increased with the PVP/AC mass ratio
and the content of N dopants. Because ID/IG provides an indication of the number
of structural defects and a quantitative measure of the edge plane
exposure, the Raman results indicated the successful N-dopant of the
N-AC samples.

2.2 Catalytic
Performance of N-AC
To
understand the performance of the N-AC catalyst, N doping levels,
reaction temperature, and space velocity were varied. Figure 4a,b show the influence of N
doping levels on the performance of the prepared N-AC catalysts. As
shown in Figure 4,
N-AC(0) displayed low EDC conversion (∼32%) and 96% VCM selectivity.
N-Doped AC catalysts dramatically enhanced the catalytic activity
with much higher EDC conversions and above 99.5% VCM selectivities.
Over the obtained N-doped samples, EDC conversion firstly increased
sharply with the increase of N content, and then increased slowly
when the addition amount of PVP was more than 4%. Over the N-AC(8)
catalyst sample, which had a total nitrogen content of 1.01%, EDC
conversion reached 60%, which was even higher than that of EDC thermal
pyrolysis reaction at about 500 °C. Further increasing the nitrogen
content to 1.44% in sample N-AC(16), no obvious improvement in EDC
conversion and a negligible effect on selectivity were observed. The
above results suggested that the number of effective active centers
that the reactants can reach out in the prepared N-AC samples did
not increase when the amount of PVP added exceeded more than 8%.

of reaction temperature. Reactions were carried out at 260 °C,
atmospheric pressure, EDC LHSV of 0.313 h–1 unless
otherwise stated.

In a further set of experiments,
the effect of space velocity on
the reaction over the typical catalyst sample N-AC(4) was investigated
and is shown in Figure 4c,d. As expected, EDC conversion decreased along with the rise of
space velocity, whereas VCM selectivities declined slightly with the
decrease of EDC LHSV. When EDC LHSV was 0.125 h–1, the conversion was about 90% and VCM selectivity was above 98.8%,
and when EDC LHSV was 0.2 h–1, the conversion was
about 80% and VCM selectivity was above 99.1%. When EDC LHSV increased
to 0.5 h–1, the conversion was about 40% and VCM
selectivity was above 99.5%. The results meant that too much long
contact time would cause side reactions.

Figure 4e,f demonstrates
the effect of the reaction temperature on the reaction over N-AC(4).
Clearly, EDC conversion increased with the rise of the temperature
and VCM selectivity decreased slightly when the reaction temperature
was raised. When the reaction temperature was as high as 300 °C,
the conversion of EDC was near 100% and the selectivity to VCM decreased
slightly but was still above 98.5%. This behavior indicated the excellent
catalytic performance of N-AC on the catalytic cracking of EDC into
VCM.

2.3 Active Sites of N-AC
As described,
the novel activity of the catalyst N-AC mainly originated from N-doping
on the surface of AC. However, XPS analysis revealed that three types
of N species coexisted in the obtained N-AC samples. Although great
efforts have been made to identify the active sites of N-doped carbon
catalysts, there are heated arguments on the role of different N specials
in active sites. To confirm the active site in N-AC samples, except
for N-AC, another series of catalyst samples denoted as acrylamide
(AM)-AC, CO(NH2)2-AC, pyridine-AC, NH4Cl-AC, and melamine-AC were synthesized and used as dehydrochlorination
catalysts, in which N was originated from acrylamide (AM), CO(NH2)2, pyridine, NH4Cl, and melamine, respectively.
Because melamine is insoluble in water, methanol was used as solution
instead of water. The textual parameters, N content of samples, and
their performance in dehydrochlorination of EDC are summarized in Table 1, too. From Table 1 we can see that all
of these samples showed similar textual parameters. The surface area
varied slightly from 900 to 1000 m2 g–1 and the total pore volume was 0.46–0.52 cm3 g–1, so the effect of textural properties on the catalytic
performance could be ignored. XPS measurements demonstrated the successful
incorporation of nitrogen into the AC. Similar to N-AC, there were
three N species including pyridinic N, graphitic N, and nitrogen oxide
N. The total N content varied from 0.3 to 0.8 atom % in these samples,
and the distributions of N species in the samples were different.
Meanwhile, the performance of these samples on EDC dehydrochlorination
is listed in Table 1, too. Clearly, the inconsistent result of the EDC conversion and
the total N content was observed. As noted from Table 1, the total N content of NH4Cl-AC
samples was the highest among them, but EDC conversion over it was
lower than that over melamine-AC.

So we correlated the catalytic
properties with their nitrogen species that originated from all nitrogenous
compounds including PVP, AM, CO(NH2)2, pyridine,
NH4Cl, and melamine. Because the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface of AC-N(16) was much smaller than the others, it was
not considered in the fitting process. Thus, the difference of the
catalytic performances of all samples including N-AC(0) was mainly
caused by different amounts of N species in the samples. The result
is shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, the EDC conversion linearly increased with the increasing amount
of both pyridinic N and graphitic N (y = 37.63x + 30.91), irrespective of the varying N resources, inferring
that pyridinic N and graphitic N were closely correlated with the
catalytic dehydrochlorination of EDC and were effective N atoms.

Figure 5 Fitting
between both pyridinic N and graphitic N species and reactivity
towards dehydrochlorination.

It is generally known that pyridinic and graphitic-N refer
to sp2 hybridized nitrogen atoms bonding with C atoms in
the hexagonal
ring.38,39 Pyridinic N contributes three electrons
to fill two σ-bonds and one aromatic π-bond and leave
a lone electron pair in the plane of the carbon matrix, whereas graphitic-N
contributes four valence electrons forming three σ-bonds and
one π-bond with the neighboring carbon (or hydrogen) atoms,
and the fifth electron is shared by the graphitic-N dopant itself
and the π* state of the conduction band. In the case of the
prepared N-AC catalysts, pyridinic-N and graphitic-N species increased
the electron–donor property of the activated carbon and thus
introduced basic centers into the carbon material, so the derived
N-AC could be used as a solid-base catalyst. Although it was reported
that pyridinic and pyrrolic N species were critical for the reaction
but quaternary N species caused catalyst deactivation,30 the above results verified that both pyridinic
N and graphitic N introduced basic sites and made for catalytic dehydrochlorination
of EDC.

The adsorptive properties of EDC and VCM on N-AC(4)
and N-AC(0)
were further studied by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis.
The results are shown in Figure 6. Clearly, the peak areas of N-AC(4) in both the EDC-TPD
profile and VCM-TPD profile were much larger than those of N-AC(0),
suggesting the enhanced adsorption capacity in N-AC(4) which should
be associated with the introduced basic centers verified by XPS results.
However, it was worth noting that the peak positions of N-AC(4) in
the VCM-TPD profile and EDC-TPD profile were 106.6 and 171.7 °C,
respectively, whereas the corresponding peaks of N-AC(0) was 110.2
°C in the VCM-TPD profile and was 188.6 °C in the EDC-TPD
profile. The much lower desorption temperatures of N-AC suggested
that both reactant EDC and product VCM could be easier and faster
to dissociate from the N-doped AC surface. The distinguished adsorption
properties of N-AC should not only make for higher EDC conversion,
but also avoid deep side reactions caused by excessive contact time
and favor better VCM selectivity.

and (b) VCM-TPD.

2.4 Stability
and Deactivation of N-AC
To explore the stability of N-AC
samples, a series of experiments
were carried out on the typical catalyst sample N-AC(4), and the results
are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows
the effect of EDC LHSV on the stability of N-AC(4) at the reaction
temperature of 260 °C. As demonstrated in Figure 7a, the conversion of EDC over N-AC(4) was
95% at an EDC LHSV of 0.125 h–1. After 10 h, EDC
LHSV was raised to 0.313 h–1, whereas the other
conditions were kept constant; here, the corresponding conversion
of EDC lowered to 67%. After maintaining this condition for 12 h,
the EDC LHSV was readjusted to 0.125 h–1; here,
the conversion of EDC recovered to about 94%, which was very close
to the initial lever. Meanwhile, VCM selectivity was consistent and
stable in the whole process.

of EDC LHSV at 260
°C. (b) The influence of reaction temperature at EDC LHSV of
0.313 h–1. (c) Long-time stability test over N-AC(4)
at 260 °C and EDC LHSV of 0.313 h–1.

Figure 7b shows
the effect of the reaction temperature on the stability of N-AC(4)
at an EDC LHSV of 0.313 h–1. As shown in Figure 7b, EDC conversion
was 37% at a temperature of 250 °C. After 10 h, the reaction
temperature was raised to 290 °C and the corresponding EDC conversion
was about 90%. When the reaction temperature was readjusted to 250
°C 10 h later, EDC conversion returned back to about 38%. Meanwhile,
VCM selectivity in all cases were relatively static and above 99%.
The results indicated that the intermittent changes of a space velocity
and reaction temperature had little influence on the catalyst activities,
which was very critical for the industrial catalyst.

To explore
the long-term stability and deactivation of the prepared
N-AC catalyst, the amplified single tube test (φ = 30 mm, EDC
LHSV 0.313 h–1) was carried out over 120 g N-AC(4),
and the result is exhibited in Figure 7c. As can be noted from Figure 7c, the EDC conversion was half of the initial
one after 560 h, whereas the VCM selectivity was above 99% at all
times. The results suggested the good stability of the N-AC catalyst.
To explore the cause of deactivation, the used N-AC(4) was carefully
characterized by XPS measurement, N2 gas adsorption and
thermogravimetric (TG) analysis.

As shown in Table 2, N content in the used N-AC(4)
decreased greatly. The total N content
downed from 0.89% in the fresh sample to 0.21%. The further deconvolution
of the XPS N 1s profile proved that the used N-AC(4) retained three
N species including pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and N-oxides, and no
other N species was produced in the reaction. Moreover, the proportions
of pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and N-oxides were, respectively, 28.57,
57.14, and 14.29%, which were very close to the N species distribution
in the fresh AC-N(4) (26.97, 60.67, and 12.36%). No obvious change
of the nitrogen species distribution was observed before and after
the catalytic reaction. The results suggested that N species in the
sample were very stable, and no obvious transformation of nitrogen
species to each other occurred. The reduction of nitrogen content,
especially pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, rather than the transformation
of nitrogen species,30 contributed to partial
deactivation of the catalyst.

a N and Cl content were analyzed by
XPS.

In contrast to the
decrease in nitrogen content, chlorine content
in the spent sample increased greatly. As can be noted in Table 2, a large amount of
chlorine occurred in the used catalyst, whereas only a trace amount
was checked in the fresh sample, which should be caused by hydrochloric
acid pretreatment. The further convolution of Cl 2p3/2 and
2p1/2 shown in Figure 8c suggested that some chlorinated organic compounds
such as chlorobenzenes and poly(vinyl chloride) covered the surface
of the used catalyst, which was further approved by the high-resolution
electron micrographs shown in Figure 9.

N-AC(4).

The textural properties of the
used N-AC(4) were further estimated
and are also shown in Table 2. As listed in Table 2, the surface area of the used N-AC(4) decreased from 976.2
to 260.8 m2 g–1 and the total pore volume
downed from 0.49 to 0.02 cm3 g–1, suggesting
that the catalyst pores were partly blocked after the catalytic reaction.
Further TG analysis under a N2 atmosphere shown in Figure 8d confirmed much
higher mass loss in the temperature range of 250–650 °C
compared with the fresh one. Without doubt, the extra part of weightlessness
should be attributed to the chemicals such as coke deposited on the
catalyst surface which caused the decrease of the surface area and
pore volume after the reaction. Meanwhile, the deposited chemicals
covered the surface of the catalyst and caused the decreased N specials.
Thus, it could be concluded that coke deposition, that caused the
pore blocking and N content decrease within the micropores and mesopores
on the AC surface, was the main reason for the partial inactivation
of the N-AC catalyst.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have demonstrated here a series of N-AC catalysts
prepared by a simple and reliable method and their excellent performance
in EDC dehydrochlorination. The results revealed that doping N into
AC supports introduced surface-basicity sites and caused partial graphitization
on the catalyst surfaces. Further experimental results indicated that
both pyridinic N and graphitic N introduced basic sites for catalytic
dehydrochlorination of EDC. The high catalytic activity and selectivity
as well as good stability suggested N-AC to be a promising dehydrochlorination
catalyst on an industrial scale.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Raw Materials
In our research, columnar
commercial coal-based activated carbon (AC) was supplied by Ningxia
Bethel Activated Carbon Co., Ltd. (Ningxia, China), poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
K-30 (PVP), urea (CO(NH2)2), acrylamide (AM),
pyridine, NH4Cl, melamine, methanol, hydrochloric acid
(37.5 wt % aqueous solution), and EDC were purchased from Titan Technology
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All of these commercial guaranteed reagents
(GR grade) were used without further purification.

4.2 N-AC Catalyst Preparation
In our
research, N-AC catalyst samples were prepared by an incipient wet
impregnation technique using columnar commercial AC as the carrier
and PVP as the N source. First, columnar commercial AC was washed
with dilute aqueous hydrogen chloride (2 mol L–1) at 50 °C overnight to remove metal ions, which would affect
the catalytic dehydrochlorination reaction, and then was filtered
by pure water five times and dried 120 °C overnight. Typically,
100 g of acid-washed AC was added to 150 mL of PVP aqueous solution
(the mass ratios of PVP to AC is 2, 4, 8, and 16%), and sonicated
for 5 min. The mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 10 h and dried
at 100 °C for 24 h. After being sintered for 6 h at 650 °C
with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 under the
protection of N2, the N-AC samples were obtained and denoted
as N-AC(2), N-AC(4), N-AC(8), and N-AC(16). N-AC(0) was obtained from
the N-AC parent by sintering in N2 for 6 h without N doping.
To confirm the active site in N-AC samples, another series of catalyst
samples denoted as AM-AC, CO(NH2)2-AC, pyridine-AC,
NH4Cl-AC, and melamine-AC were synthesized by the same
method, in which N originated from acrylamide, urea, pyridine, NH4Cl, and melamine, respectively. Because melamine was insoluble
in water, methanol was used as a solution instead of water when the
melamine-AC sample was prepared.

4.3 Characterization
of Catalyst Samples
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of various synthesized samples
were recorded on a D8 Advance Da Vinci with a Cu source (40 kV, 20
mA). The high-resolution transmission electron micrograph was operated
at an FEI Talos F200X at 300 kV. N2 adsorption at −196
°C was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 apparatus. XPS
was carried out on a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD spectroscope with Al Kα
X-rays as the excitation source at 1000 meV and 150 W. The binding
energies were calibrated by the contaminant carbon (C 1s 284.6 eV).
The pressed powder pellet method was used to minimize the analytic
error, which would be caused by the limit of the electron escape depth
based on XPS analysis. Raman spectra were obtained with a Senterra
R200-L using a 514.5 nm AR line as an excitation source. Thermogravimetric
(TG) analysis was carried out on TA Instruments-Waters LLC Q-600 STD,
in which the temperature was ramped to 800 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1. TPD was performed on a Micromeritics
AutoChem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector in
the temperature range of 50–600 °C. The heating rate was
10 °C min–1, and the gas flow rate was 20 mL
min–1. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments
were initiated by pretreatment of the catalyst with He for 30 min
at 600 °C. Subsequently, the catalyst temperature was cooled
down to 150 °C and an adsorption gas was introduced for 20 min.
The catalyst temperature was then kept constant for 20 min to flush
away any loosely bound surface species. Subsequently, the catalyst
temperature was decreased to 50 °C. The step of desorption was
then carried out in the temperature range of 50–600 °C.

4.4 Catalytic Reactions
Dehydrochlorination
of EDC was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (diameter
= 14 mm, length = 700 mm) at atmospheric pressure and 220–300
°C. Generally, 15 g of catalyst was used. The pipeline and quartz
tube reactor were flushed with nitrogen to remove water and air from
the system before the reaction. Pure EDC was then fed into the entrance
of the reactor by a double-plunger micro-pump, and then vaporized.
The reactant and products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC)
(Shimadzu GC-2014), and HCl was analyzed by acid base titration.
