One-dimensional (1D) Nd/Fe/polyamide
66 (Nd/Fe/PA66) three-layer
coaxial nanocable arrays with high aspect ratio and highly anisotropic
magnetization were successfully prepared via layer-by-layer deposition
in the anodic aluminum oxide template. The morphology, chemical composition,
and magnetic properties of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables were characterized
by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometry . The effects
of 1D nanocables on the magnetic properties of the assembled ordered
arrays have been systematically investigated. The structural properties
of these nanostructures are investigated as a function of the geometrical
parameters. The magnetic anisotropy of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables has been
significantly enhanced owing to the doped Nd that possesses a larger
spin-orbital coupling and leads to a synergistic effect with Fe to
enhance anisotropy energy.

1 Introduction
In recent years, magnetic
nanostructures have played an important
role because of their potential applications in nanoelectronics devices,
high-density recording, biological sensors, and high-frequency sensors.1−4 Magnetic nanomaterials have been extensively studied because of
their magnetic anisotropy in applications.5 Magnetic materials with different magnetization anisotropies are
often genetically determined by the preparation methods and dimensions
(i.e., the diameter or the length).6,7

It is
difficult to obtain and maintain homogeneous and pure one-dimensional
(1D) nanowires because of oxidation and adsorption during fabrication
and application processes;8 therefore,
in many cases, ferromagnetic metals were composited with other materials
to prepare various nanocomposites, such as multisection nanowires,
nanocables and alloys.9−14 Therefore, it is promising and interesting for researchers to prepare
various structural magnetic nanomaterials with high magnetic anisotropy,
giant magnetoresistance, or multifunction nanomaterials.5,15,16 For example, multisection ferromagnetic
nanowires, such as Ni–Fe/Cu/Co/Cu, Ni–Fe/Cu, Co/Cu,
Fe/Cu, and Co/Cu/Ni–Fe/Cu,9−13 have magnetic properties and giant magnetoresistance
effect. Nanocables are typical of 1D composite materials, and a lot
of literatures have reported the preparation and applications, for
instance, Fe/Fe–dimethylsulfoxide nanocables; the arrays of
nanocables showed an obvious anisotropy with the easy magnetizing
axial parallel to the length of nanocable.12 Fe/carbon nanotubes (Fe/CNTs) have electromigration effect and can
be used as memory devices and nanopipettes.17−19 Fe/Pd nanocables
have a prominent catalytic activity in ligand-free C–N bond
formation in water. As is known to all, Nd–Fe–B composite
is a famous permanent magnet. Inspired by this, few lectures have
reported the preparation methods of rare earth metal-doped nanomaterials
and studied their magnetic property.20−23 The results showed that the magnetism
changed with the increase of rare earth metals; nevertheless, the
fabrication of ferromagnetic nanowires or nanocables doped with rare
earth metals has been less reported.

In this report, we introduced
the preparation method of Nd/Fe/PA66
three-layer nanocable arrays with different magnetic anisotropies.
The outermost-layer nanotubes, which can protect metal nanomaterials
from being oxidized, were fabricated by solution wetting the anodic
aluminum oxide (AAO) template. PA66/AAO nanotubes served as a “second
template” to deposit the middle-layer Fe nanotubes. Fe/PA66/AAO
nanotubes served as a “third template” to deposit the
internal-layer Nd nanowires to form Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables. In addition,
the magnetism of Fe nanotubes, Fe/PA66 nanotubes, and Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables
was studied systematically.

2 Results and Discussion
The morphology of PA66 nanotubes is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows that the PA66 nanotubes
formed ordered arrays without AAO template supporting. Figure 1b shows that the PA66 has a
good nanotube structure with a continuous and uniform pipe wall. The
morphology and structure of Fe nanotubes and Fe/PA66 coaxial nanotubes
are shown in Figure 2. These nanotubes were separated by dissolving alumina in NaOH aqueous
solution. Figure 2c,d
shows pure Fe nanotubes. It can be seen that the nanotubes are array
structures, the diameter of Fe nanotubes is about 200 nm, and the
wall is thin and continuous. Figure 2a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
of Fe/PA66 coaxial nanotubes. The length of the two nanotubes is almost
same, and the ends of Fe nanotubes are open. The coaxial nanotube
is confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 2b), and the Fe nanotube
is coated tightly by PA66 nanotubes. The patterns of selected area
electron diffraction(SAED) (Figure 2b,d) indicate that the Fe nanotube is a polycrystalline
structure. Furthermore, some Fe nanoparticles that attached on the
inner wall of the PA66 nanotubes can be seen. Fe nanoparticles with
magnetism could form various kinds of magnetic domain and distribute
optionally onto the inner wall of the PA66 nanotubes before the formation
of Fe nanowires; the phenomenon also appears in Figure 2d and Ni nanotubes,24 which may be the intrinsic characteristics of ferromagnetic metals.

SAED pattern.

Fe/PA66 coaxial nanotubes
can be used as templates to prepare other
new materials. Nd was deposited in the above coaxial nanotubes to
prepare three-layer coaxial nanocables. The morphology and structural
features of Nd/Fe/PA66 are shown in Figure 3. The SEM image shown in Figure 3a clearly depicts that the
nanostructure is a core/shell nanocable array and the length of the
nanocables is almost the same. The core is almost a solid wire. It
is confirmed that Nd nanowires occupied almost all Fe/PA66 nanotubes.
However, few nanotubes still exist. Above-mentioned microscopic structures
were proved by the typical TEM images, as shown in Figure 3b. The TEM image reveals that
the nanocable is a high aspect ratio 1D structure (>40), and it
can
be seen that most are solid, and few are a tubular structure, which
is resulted by two possible cases as follows: one is that few PA66
nanotubes were blocked by the PA66, and the metal ions could not be
deposited into; and the other is that few PA66 nanotubes or Fe/PA66
nanotubes at the edge of the AAO template could not be deposited into
by the metal ions. From the zoom-in TEM image (Figure 3c), it is clearly shown that the nanocable
consists of a bright PA66 nanotube shell and a dark Nd/Fe nanowire
core. It is proved that the materials of the core and shell are different.
The Nd nanowire grew out of the Fe/PA66 nanotube, which is seen from
the top of the Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable. The SAED pattern, which is marked
by a red circle, as shown in Figure 3c, reveals that the Nd nanowire belongs to a single-crystal
structure. However, the crystal form of the Nd/Fe/PA66 composite belongs
to a polycrystalline configuration (the area marked with the red square
in Figure 3c). The
SAED pattern is mainly from Fe materials. The reason may be that the
sample is thick and electron beam cannot pass through it.

of the Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable, and (c) zoom-in TEM image showing a polycrystalline
configuration of the Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable. Inset is the SAED pattern
of different areas.

The crystalline structure
of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables was characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 4). Crystalline phases of PA66 can transfer in the limited
space.25 Only γ crystalline phase
exists in the PA66 nanotubes at room temperature as revealed by the
presence of the γ peak at 24.0°. The absence of γ
phase is probably because of the preferred formation of γ phase
in the space-confined deposition driven by a kinetic factor. Among
another five peaks, two distinct peaks observed at 2θ of 44.4°
and 64.6° are consistent with the diffraction peaks of (110)
and (200) crystalline planes of Fe, respectively. Two distinct peaks
observed at 2θ of 64.6° and 77.6° are consistent with
the diffraction peaks of (311) and (206) crystalline planes of Nd,
respectively. Another two diffraction peaks (2θ of 38.2°
and 81.7°) were introduced by the sputtered Au film used for
electrodeposition.

Magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanotubes
can be determined
by the angular dependence of the coercive field in ordered arrays
of ferromagnetic nanotubes, and the two most common magnetization
reversal modes can be modeled by coherent rotation or curling.26 Generally, for magnetic nanowires, magnetization
reversal is different from magnetic nanotubes about the field angle.

Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) is employed to investigate
the magnetic behaviors of Fe nanotubes, Fe/PA66 nanotubes, and Nd/Fe/PA66
nanocables. The magnetic hysteresis (M–H) loops of the three samples are shown in Figure 4. The magnetic properties can
be changed by the geometry. Figures 2 and 3 show that there are distinct
differences in the vertical geometry and transverse geometry of the
nanotubes or nanocables; therefore, the magnetic properties are obviously
different between Fe nanotubes, Fe/PA66 nanotubes, and Nd/Fe/PA66
nanocables (Figure 5). It is obvious that the magnetism along the long axis of nanotubes
or nanocables is bigger than that of the vertical direction. That
is to say, the direction along the long axis is easily magnetized.
It is interesting that the coercivity paralleling to the long axis
in the Fe/PA66 nanotube arrays is very small. Taking into consideration
of the error of VSM, the magnetization curves pass through the ordinate
origin; thus, the coaxial double-nanotube arrays display superparamagnetic
nature. It is promising to be used as superparamagnetic materials,
which can be used in biological magnetic-perception field.3 However, from the square shown in Figure 5c, it can be seen that the
Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables have a better magnetic property than Fe nanotubes
and Fe/PA66 nanotubes and are more easily magnetized than Fe nanotubes
and Fe/PA66 nanotubes. In our previous studies, it has been found
that the magnetism of the composite with a nonmagnetic single-crystal
metal as cores and a magnetic polycrystal metal as sheaths was enhanced,15 and the magnetism of the composite with a magnetic
polycrystal metal as cores and another magnetic polycrystal metal
as sheaths was decreased.16Figure 3c displayed that the Fe nanotube
as a sheath is a polycrystal and the Nd nanowire as a core is a single
crystal. This may be a universal law: magnetism will be enhanced when
magnetic polycrystal metals as sheaths coat the nonmagnetic single-crystal
metals as cores. The Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable arrays are in good agreement
with the law. The M–H loop
shape of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables is closer to that of the hard magnetic
materials than those of Fe and Fe/PA66 nanotubes. Therefore, the Nd/Fe/PA66
nanocables are suitable for preparing permanent magnetic materials
and applications in perpendicular recording media.

Figure 5 M–H loops of (a) Fe/AAO
nanotube arrays, (b) Fe/PA66/AAO nanotube arrays, and (c) Nd/Fe/PA66/AAO
nanocable arrays. (H denotes the magnetic field, L denotes the long axis of the nanotube/nanocable).

According to the M–H loops
in Figure 5a–c,
the magnetization intensity achieves a maximum value (Mmax) when the direction of H is parallel
to the long axis of nanotubes/nanocables, whereas that has a minimum
value (Mmin) when the direction of H is perpendicular to the long axis of nanotubes/nanocables.
The value of Mmax/Mmin can be employed to evaluate the magnetic anisotropy of
nanotubes/nanocables and determined as 3.18, 1.01, and 5.25 for Fe
nanotube arrays, Fe/PA66 nanotube arrays, and Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable
arrays, respectively. It is very easy to be understood. The three
systems have the same diameter, which determines the anisotropy energy
of the nanowires. The pure Fe nanotube is regarded as a reference.
After coating PA66, which shows weak magnetism, the diameter of the
Fe nanotube becomes thinner and decreases the anisotropy. However,
Nd, as a typical rare earth metal, usually possesses a larger spin-orbital
coupling, which leads to a larger anisotropy energy. Another reason
is that Nd nanoparticles diffused into Fe, which leads to a synergistic
effect and enhances the anisotropy energy of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables.27

Table 1 shows the
magnetic properties of nanostructures consisting of Fe, Fe/PA66, and
Nd/Fe/PA66/ in AAO templates. We compare the magnetic properties of
pure and composite nanostructure arrays in AAO templates. It can be
seen that the magnetic properties of the nanotube and nanocable are
intrinsic; therefore, the dipolar interaction among the nanostructure
is different. From Table 1, the variation in the values of Hc and Mr/Ms and in the magnetic hysteresis (M–H) loops is observed for different nanostructure arrays.
Magnetic parameters of the three systems in perpendicular and parallel
directions are obviously different. It can be proved that the magnetic
anisotropy of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables is better than those of Fe and
Fe/Pa66.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Preparation of PA66 Nanotubes and Fe/PA66
Nanotubes
AAO templates were used as purchased from Whatman
Corp. The diameter of the pores in the AAO templates is 200 nm, and
the depth is about 60 μm. Formic acid was employed as the solvent
to prepare 5 wt % of PA66 solution. A drop of PA66 solution was placed
on a glass slide, and then, a piece of AAO template was covered on
the PA66 solution. The length of the PA66 nanotubes was controlled
by the growth time.

The AAO template filled with PA66 nanotubes
was used as a “second template” to deposit Fe nanotubes.
First of all, the AAO template filled with PA66 nanotubes was treated
with formic acid to make the PA66 nanotube to open, and then, a thin
film of Au was sputtered on a side of the AAO/PA66 composite membrane
to serve as the working electrode.

Electrolyte solution used
for the electrodeposition of Fe is composed
of 0.6 M FeSO4·7H2O, 0.2 M H3BO3, and 0.3 M KCl. The AAO/PA66 composite membrane was
used as the working electrode and also the template for the deposition
of Fe. A platinum plate served as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl
electrode in saturated KCl solution as the reference electrode. Direct
current (dc) electrodeposition at −1.2 V/SCE was employed to
deposit Fe in PA66 nanotubes for 15 min to form Fe/PA66 nanotube arrays.

For comparison, Fe nanotubes were also prepared by the dc electrodeposition
of Fe in the AAO template at −0.8 V/SCE for 15 min.

3.2 Preparation of Nd/Fe/PA66 Nanocables
The Fe/PA66 composite
membrane was used as a “third template”
to deposit Nd nanowires. Electrolyte solution is composed of 0.4 M
Nd(NO3)2, 0.2 M H3BO3 and
0.3 M KCl. dc electrodeposition at −0.4 V/SCE was employed
to deposit Nd into Fe/PA66 nanotubes for 40 min to form Nd/Fe/PA66
nanocable arrays.

The preparation process is displayed in schematic
diagram (Figure 6).

solvent volatilizing.

3.3 Characterization
SEM (JEOL JSM-6390LV),
TEM (CM200-FEG equipped with a GIF) were used to characterize the
morphology of nanotubes and nanocables. For SEM imaging, all samples
were separated by dissolving the alumina membrane in NaOH aqueous
solution. For TEM measurement, a drop of (5 μL) diluted sample
was dried on a copper grid. The crystalline structure of the obtained
materials was determined by XRD (Bruker D8 Advance with a Cu Kα
radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). Magnetization of nanotubes and
nanocables was measured at room temperature (295 K) with a vibrating
sample magnetometer (Quantum Design-PPMS). All samples embedded in
AAO templates, such as Fe/AAO, Fe/PA66/AAO, and Nd/Fe/PA66/AAO, are
closely related to their microstructure and therefore to the growth
condition.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have prepared Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocable arrays with shape
anisotropy and magnetic anisotropy through AAO template-assisted method
with polymer solution wetting technique and two-step electrodeposition
technique. The two methods offer low cost and a simple way to fabricate
nanocable arrays. In an array with all nanocables initially magnetized
in the same direction, the magnetostatic interaction between neighboring
tubes favors the magnetization reversal of some of them. The Nd/Fe/PA66
nanocable arrays have been demonstrated with high anisotropic magnetization
along the long axial direction. The magnetic anisotropy can be manipulated
by filling with the rare earth metal Nd. Owing to the hard magnetic
material nature of Nd/Fe/PA66 nanocables, these arrays possess the
ability of permanent magnet materials. It is anticipated that such
a finding provides a facile and effective approach for preparing high-magnetic
nanocable arrays for application in perpendicular recording media.
