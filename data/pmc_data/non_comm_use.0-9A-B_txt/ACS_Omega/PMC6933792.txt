Surface plasmon polaritons on (silver) nanowires are
promising
components for future photonic technologies. Here, we study near-field
patterns on silver nanowires with a scattering-type scanning near-field
optical microscope that enables the direct mapping of surface waves.
We analyze the spatial pattern of the plasmon signatures for different
excitation geometries and polarization and observe a plasmon wave
pattern that is canted relative to the nanowire axis, which we show
is due to a superposition of two different plasmon modes, as supported
by electromagnetic simulations including the influence of the substrate.
These findings yield new insights into the excitation and propagation
of plasmon polaritons for applications in nanoplasmonic devices.

1 Introduction
Silver nanowires (Ag-NWs)
have attracted a great deal of attention
over the last few years. Due to their ability to carry subwavelength
plasmon modes,1,2 they are promising tools for future
optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications, which aim at benefiting
from the advantages of light (e.g., its speed) in photonic on-chip
devices.3−6 Recently, terahertz (THz) photomixers equipped with Ag NWs in their
active region have shown an enhanced emission especially at higher
frequencies (>1 THz) compared to the state-of-the-art interdigital
photomixer design.7 The incorporation of
Ag NWs into photomixers leads to a significant reduction of the device
capacitance of around 1 order of magnitude and increases the photocurrent
by up to 32 times as compared to conventional photomixers. In such
devices, it is still an open question whether plasmonic effects in
the Ag NW also play an essential role in the device behavior, which
is one motivation of the present study, investigating plasmons on
Ag NWs excited by near-infrared light.

Surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs) on NWs, which support a set of
various SPP modes, can be mapped and analyzed with various experimental
techniques. The contribution of different plasmon modes has been investigated
in the far field by quantum-dot fluorescence,4,8 whereas
near-field measurements by means of scanning near-field optical microscopy
(SNOM)9 just reported a single mode so
far (all of these reports were in the optical range for Ag NWs). The
scattering-type SNOM (s-SNOM) technique until now has been applied
only in the infrared range e.g., on InAs NWs.10

Here, the s-SNOM technique is not only employed to map the
near-field
pattern of a single mode like in many other s-SNOM applications11,12 but also to study different modes propagating simultaneously on
Ag NWs. They are excited with near-infrared radiation at a wavelength
of 853 nm, which is the frequency regime of the optical beat note
of the respective THz photomixers employing nanowire contacts. The
near-infrared s-SNOM measurements described in our paper focus on
the question whether plasma waves are excited on a NW, even if its
geometry has not been optimized or specifically selected to support
resonances of such waves. How effectively such plasma waves contribute
to the efficiency of the photomixers will be the subject of future
studies.

Free-standing NWs possess cylindrical symmetry and
one can readily
solve Maxwell’s equations to find the dispersion and field
distributions8,13−15 for each plasmon
mode. For the case here, where the NW lies on a substrate, one must
solve for the modes numerically,4,16,17 which leads to a similar set of modes, only with modified dispersion
and asymmetric field distributions. We also simulate the plasmon modes
for our specific case here.

Typically s-SNOM measurements employ
p-polarized incident light,
i.e., where the incident electric field has a component parallel to
the atomic force microscope (AFM) tip (see Figure 1a), which can then act as an antenna.18 However, for p-polarized light, we observe only
plasmons on the Ag NW if it is oriented parallel to the incident direction,
i.e., a portion of the E-field is parallel to the NW as well. An ∼90°-rotated
NW shows no plasmon response at all (see the Supporting Information; Figure S2). Additionally, we also performed s-SNOM
measurements with s-polarized excitation, which allows one to have
the incident field purely along the NW axis (using a proper sample
alignment). In both cases, the orientation of the NW axis was chosen
to have the maximum incident field component along the NW axis (by
rotating the sample plane, see Figure 1b) and the polarization of the external local-oscillator
beam (used for heterodyne detection of the scattered light collected
from the tip and delivered to the photodetector) was rotated to measure
mainly the z-component (i.e., perpendicular to the
sample plane) of the surface-wave electric field.19 The incident beam angle was ∼30° for all measurements.

with θ ∼30°) and the E-field along the y-axis. (c, d) AFM topography of the nanowire recorded in parallel

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the schematics of the p- and s-polarization geometries, respectively,
while the corresponding AFM images of the NW are presented in Figure 1c,d. The simultaneous
second-harmonic (2Ω) pseudo-heterodyne20 s-SNOM measurements are presented in Figure 1e,f for p- and s-polarization, respectively. Figure 1g,h shows the respective
lineouts along the central axis of the NW from these near-field images.
In both p- and s-polarized cases, there is a clearly observable signal
measured along the wire, which contains a contribution from the SPPs.
The third-harmonic (3Ω) s-SNOM data (Figure S3a,b), which offer higher background suppression, reproduces
the 2Ω signal pattern in Figure 1. However, due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio for
3Ω-detection, we concentrate on the 2Ω s-SNOM data for
the subsequent analysis. The optical phase (measured in parallel to Figure 1f by the interferometric
detection) supports our findings (Figure S3c,d). Both measurements in Figure 1 are on the same NW. The doubled “ghost”
image in Figure 1d
is due to a double tip (the same tip as in Figure S2). However, simple geometrical considerations (to exclude
that the tilted pattern is a “double” image) as well
as the reproduction of the pattern in further measurements (amongst
others Figure S6) convinced us that it
is justifiable to choose the measurement with the highest signal-to-noise
ratio for quantitative analysis since only the averaged lineouts along
the NWs are taken into account.

In contrast to previous reports
in the mid-IR, where SPPs are launched
by the tip and form standing waves due to reflections from both ends
of the structures (for NWs10 and other
structures12), here the surface modes are
launched due to scattering at the NW end facets, which is known for
optical/NIR frequency experiments.21

In the p-polarization measurement, the SPPs are launched by the
NW facet oriented toward the incident light (left column, Figure 1e). In addition to
the surface waves, a second signal contribution Em is produced directly at the tip, i.e., due to the conventional
s-SNOM dielectric contrast signal.22 As
expected in the near-infrared, the latter signal is stronger in the
image above the Ag NW than the substrate. The crucial point that determines
the form of the interference is the phase difference ΔΦ
between the SPP waves (which propagate along the NW with wavevector kspp) compared to the material contribution (where
the beam propagates directly to the tip with an in-plane wavevector
component k0·cos θ)
at the position of the tip, where the SPP is coupled out into far-field
radiation. The two waves (SPP and material scattered field) form an
interference pattern with a wavelength Λ that is mapped by s-SNOM.
The straightforward geometrical considerations depicted in Figure 2a yield eqs 1 and 2, for
the phase shift and wavelength of the interference between SPP and
conventional s-SNOM signals 1   2  While we present a quantitative modeling of
the expected signal vs position along the NW axis below, one sees
immediately from eq 2 that for kspp ≈ k0cos θ, a long-wave interference pattern (Λ
≫ λspp,λ0) is expected (e.g.,
a mode with λSPP = 852 nm, λ0 =
853 nm, and θ = 30° is observed with a wavelength of Λ
∼6.3 μm).

p-polarization and (b) s-polarization. (c) Distribution of the electric
field amplitude calculated in COMSOL Multiphysics for s-polarization.
The geometry of the problem and TE-polarization of the incident wave
allow the reduction of the model using a perfect electrical conductor
(PEC) boundary condition at the plane perpendicular to the wire crossing
its center.

Another intriguing aspect of the p-polarization
model is that only
excitation from the end facet closer to the incident laser is required
to explain the measurement. An excitation from the other side would
result in a plus sign in the denominator of eq 2, and therefore, an additional wave pattern
Λ < λ0 close to the right end should be
visible but have not been observed. This could be explained since
both sides are not symmetrical, and indeed, the excitation geometry
differs;23 on the incident side of the
NW, the charges can be separated more easily (see Figure S4). This is confirmed as well by additional measurements
with a 180° rotation of the nanowire (see Figure S5), where a similar pattern is observed. Since the
laser spot is focused on the tip and the sample is scanned beneath,
the launching of SPPs at the edge gets weaker with a Gaussian dependence
with increasing y as the tip and input beam center
move away from the edge (see Figure 2a,b). This effect is dominant in comparison to the
signal decay due to SPP propagation loss. For this reason and also
considering the wire length, the reflection of the SPP at the opposite
end of the NW is not considered to form a Fabry–Perot resonator
as in other studies.9,24

The p-polarization configuration
will be later fitted with two
modes (the explanation of the two modes’ properties follows
in the next paragraph about the s-polarization; we interpret both
measurements with the same two modes) and one could in principle interpret
and fit the p-polarization data with a single mode as well. However,
as already stated in eq 1 due to the phase retardation effect by the Em-field, the observed SPP wavelength results in a much higher interference wavelength
Λ (see eq 2), and
therefore, two modes are barely distinguishable in this measurement
since Λ is larger than the entire fitting range due to the Gaussian
beam shape.

The degradation in the s-SNOM signal directly behind
the NW (at
∼8 μm in Figure 1g) can be explained by a shadowing effect of the NW itself
(taking note of the incident direction from the left).

With
the incident s-polarized light, there is neither a material
contribution excited in the s-SNOM since there is no field component
parallel to the tip (indeed in the experiment, the components are
always at least slightly present and coupled) or any phase shift of
the field at the end of the NW where the SPPs are excited (see Figure 2b). For this measurement,
higher laser power and lock-in time constants (100 ms instead of 20
ms for p-polarization) are used to obtain a satisfactory data quality.
One way to interpret this geometry is to consider eq 2 with θ = 90°, which
corresponds to a constant phase shift between the SPP waves and material
contribution, such that one measures the SPP wavelengths directly.
The increase in the signal envelope in the first few microns (cf. Figure 1f for y in the range between 0 and 2 μm) is already suggestive of
beating between more than one SPP mode, which is also implied by the
tilted spatial pattern (Figure 1f). A similar pattern was reported in the case of NWs in a
homogeneous environment, where the fundamental mode (TM0) together with a phase-shifted higher-order mode can form chiral
and tilted patterns4 (the phase shift of
the latter was due to the specific excitation geometry). Since there
are similar mode shapes in the case of Ag NW on substrates,4,17 we deduce that this behavior is present as well in our case, as
supported by the simulations below. The theory of the different modes
is described in detail in ref (4). However, the applied experimental technique of quantum-dot
fluorescence imaging has a limited spatial resolution and is only
capable of detecting the far-field beating pattern of the intensity,
whereas our s-SNOM measurements reveal the full electric field distribution
with subwavelength resolution and therefore complement those studies.

For the s-polarization measurement, we also attribute the asymmetric
SPP pattern to an asymmetric excitation of the two nanowire ends (Figure S4) to explain why only SPPs launched
from one side are dominant in the data. Since the samples are positioned
by hand, there is always a slight deviation from the ideal 90°
angle between incident light and the NW axis. In additional control
measurements with a different fine tuning of the NW orientation relative
to the input beam, one can also achieve the situation where the dominant
SPP signals originate from the opposite end (see the Supporting Information; Figure S6).

To obtain the SPP wavelengths
and to verify our interpretation,
additional numerical simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics
(for details, see the Supporting Information). Two leaky eigenmodes (with ky1 = 0.993k0 and ky2 = 1.001k0, respectively) can be identified for the Ag NW on the GaAs substrate
system (see Figure S7) for an incident
wavelength of 853 nm, in addition to a third eigenmode, which is not
detectable by our s-SNOM measurements because its field is nearly
entirely concentrated in the substrate beneath the NW and will therefore
not be considered further in the data analysis. The intensity of the
total field of both modes is presented in Figure 2c. The data support that an excitation of
the NW end can result in the tilted field distribution seen experimentally
(Figure 1f). Using
the two eigenmode wavelengths and our models (Figure 2a,b), the averaged near-field lineouts (cf. Figure 1g,h) can be fitted
well, as shown in Figure 3a,b. For the p-polarization measurement, two propagating and
phase-retarded modes (see eq 1) are considered together with a dielectric material offset
term, whereas in the s-polarization measurement, the two modes are
mapped directly (with an arbitrary offset instead of the material
term). Although the propagation length of the modes are taken into
account, the decreasing behavior in both measurements is dominated
by the Gaussian beam shape of the excitation spot (see Figure 2a,b). The decomposition of
the simulation in Figure 3a,b (blue curve) into its different components is shown in Figure 3c,d.

Figure 3 Measured s-SNOM signals
(red) and corresponding fits (blue) based
on the models in Figure 2a,b for (a) p-polarization and (b) s-polarization. (c, d) Two different
modes and a constant background term contribute to the simulated signal
(blue), respectively.

In the p-polarization case, one mode amplitude
is ∼20 times
higher, and therefore, mainly this mode is excited. However, in the
s-polarization measurement, both amplitudes are quite similar (7%
deviation). The explicit equations and the fitting procedure are described
further in the Supporting Information.
To support our findings, the p-polarization measurement was repeated
as well on another NW with a λ0 = 780 nm laser; the
shorter resulting SPP wavelength is confirmed by three visible maxima
(Figure S8).

We close by considering
whether the NW may support plasmon resonances
in its transverse direction. Such resonances should be excited efficiently
if the incident light is polarized in the transverse direction of
the NW. However, we did not observe corresponding resonance signatures
in our s-SNOM measurements for this case (see Figure S2). In fact, the two modes which are accessible to
the s-SNOM measurements have wavelengths of 852 and 859 nm (see Figure S7), too large to allow formation of a
standing wave on the 200 nm-wide wire.25−27 The “hidden”
mode of Figure S7 (propagating nearly entirely
in the substrate) is expected to have a wavelength of 233 nm and may
become resonant. As we cannot determine from our NIR s-SNOM measurements
whether this is the case, one should refer to measurements on full
photomixer devices. The efficiency of the THz-generation process should
depend on the polarization of the incident NIR laser light. Unfortunately,
such measurements have not been reported yet.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have mapped
out the field patterns of surface plasmon
polaritons on a silver nanowire in an inhomogeneous environment (wires
on GaAs, exposed to air). The polaritons have been generated by near-infrared
excitation and probed using the near-field capabilities of an s-SNOM
microscope. We have observed a single mode for p-polarized excitation
and a tilted dual-mode pattern in the case of s-polarization. We can
account for the signal profiles of both cases using a propagation
model for plasmon polaritons, whose wavelengths have been derived
from electromagnetic simulations. The model considers the interference
between signal contributions as well as the excitation beam profile.
To improve the understanding of the efficiency enhancement of THz
photomixers that employ such Ag nanowires as electrical contacts,
the next step will be to apply nanoscopic detection methods to map
the THz near-fields close to the nanowires in a photomixer device
driven by two-color near-infrared excitation and to test whether one
finds an enhanced density of excited charge carriers in the close
vicinity of the wire.

4 Experimental Section
The s-SNOM technique
employs a near-field microscope based on an
atomic force microscope (AFM) in noncontact mode. A laser is focused
on the tip–sample region and due to a near-field interaction,
a portion of the light is scattered away that contains information
about the dielectric properties of the sample beneath the tip. The
spatial resolution is not limited by the focal beam diameter but rather
by the lateral dimensions of the tip (typically ∼20 nm), which
is independent of the wavelength used.18 The measured signals are demodulated at higher harmonics of the
cantilever tapping frequency Ω to suppress background signal
contributions in combination with an interferometric pseudo-heterodyne
detection scheme.18,20 Topographical AFM images and
near-field s-SNOM images are always recorded simultaneously. Another
powerful application of the s-SNOM platform besides nanoimaging of
the surface dielectric properties is the mapping of surface electromagnetic
waves, which can be excited by the incident light and subsequently
converted back to scattered waves by the tip after propagation along
the surface. Interference of the surface-wave signals and directly
scattered fields leads to the formation of standing wave patterns
that are manifested in the s-SNOM images.12,28 However, one must take care to correctly identify and interpret
the different contributions (and their interference), especially in
the optical/NIR regime.21,29 The details of the
s-SNOM apparatus employed here are given in the Supporting Information. The considered sample consists of
Ag-NWs from ACS Material arranged manually on a 1 μm-thick layer
of low-temperature-grown (LTG)-GaAs (grown on a 350 μm-thick
undoped GaAs substrate; Wafer Technology Ltd.), which is also used
for THz nano-photomixers (see the Supporting Information; Figure S1).
