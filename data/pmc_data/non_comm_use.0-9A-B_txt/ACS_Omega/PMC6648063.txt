Introduction
Long persistent luminescence phosphors
can store light energy and
release the storage of energy at a certain temperature with long-lasting
visible light emission.1 After the removal
of light source, a persistent luminescence material can continue
to emit persistent luminescence from minutes to hours, which currently
has been applicable or researchable in the field of night illumination,
optical storage, and solar energy utilization.2−5 In recent years, nanoparticles
with near-infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence have emerged as a
new class of background-free contrast agents that are promising for
in vivo imaging techniques.6−9

Alkaline earth silicate and aluminate are favorable
host materials.
The development and research of rare-earth ion sensitized aluminate
and silicate materials has been the principal part of long persistent
luminescence materials in the recent years.10,11 Aluminosilicate is also a good luminescent matrix with advantages
such as stable chemical property, low synthesis temperature, abundant
raw material, and low cost. Therefore, aluminosilicate has great value
in research and application as a novel long persistent luminescence
matrix. The structure of aluminosilicate is complicated, with a wide
variety of phase compositions. Thus, it is difficult to prepare a
single pure phase. The complex crystal structure of aluminosilicate
can create multiple lattice environments for doped rare-earth ions,
which can generate different luminescence centers, therefore obtaining
a unique luminescence property.12,13 However, until now,
only a few aluminosilicate luminescent materials have been reported,
such as BaAl2Si2O8 and CaAl2Si2O8.14,15

We use Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70 (BASO) as
the matrix, and by doping the Eu2+ ion, the yellow luminescence
material Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+ is obtained. After adding the Tm3+ ion, Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ shows
an excellent persistent luminescence property. By measuring and analyzing
the sample, we study the photoluminescence property and persistent
luminescence property of Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+ and Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ systematically.

Results and Discussion
Phase
Identification and Crystal Structure
Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70 belongs to a hexagonal crystal system, with space
group P63/m (Figure 1a). The lattice parameters
are a = b = 1.5178 nm, c = 0.8871 nm, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, and V = 1.7696 nm3.16 In the lattice of BASO, AlO4 and
Al/SiO4 tetrahedra form a three-dimensional network structure
by means of a sharing vertex. Along the direction of the c axis, a three-dimensional network structure of AlO4 and
Al/SiO4 tetrahedra forms two kinds of channels. In the
lattice, there are three kinds of Ba lattice sites. There are two
lattice sites, Ba(1) and Ba(3), which occupy completely in channel
2. Channel 1 is occupied by the Ba(2) lattice site, which consists
of a six-membered ring formed by six Al/SiO4 tetrahedra.
The Ba(1) lattice site in channel 2 and Ba(1) or Ba(3) lattice sites
in channel 1 can be connected by either the Al/SiO4 tetrahedron
or the O atom directly (Ba–O–Ba). The coordination number
of the Ba2+ ion and oxygen atom in channel 2 is 9. The
ionic radius is 0.142 nm. The ionic radii of eight-coordinated Eu2+ and Tm3+ are 0.125 and 0.0994 nm, respectively.
The ionic radii of nine-coordinated Eu2+ and Tm3+ are 0.13 and 0.1052 nm, respectively. In the lattice of BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+, the ionic radius of Eu2+ is
close to Tm3+ and Ba2+. Eu2+ and
Tm3+ ions tend to substitute the lattice site of Ba2+ in the matrix. Figure 1b shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+. The XRD diffraction peaks are in accordance
with BASO, which indicate that Eu2+ and Tm3+ enter the
lattice successfully.

(c) Powder X-ray diffraction refinement of Ba12.95Al30.7Si5.3O70:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+.

To understand the crystal structure
information of the co-doped
sample, we refer to the BASO crystal structure information reported
by Rief et al.16 We proceed to the BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ structure refinement using GSAS software,
as shown in Figure 1c. After the refinement, the crystal structure information is a = b = 1.5058 nm, c =
0.8732 nm, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, and V = 1.7146 nm3. From the results of refining,
cell parameters can be seen, and the unit cell volume of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ decreases. The reason for this phenomenon
may be the substitution of the Ba2+ ion with a larger ionic
radius by Eu2+ and Tm3+ with smaller ionic radii.
TmBa• defect with a positive charge is generated after the substitution
of the trivalent Tm3+ ion. At the same time, Ba2+ ionic vacancy VBa″ is formed to keep the charge balance of the lattice.
These parameters cause the shrinkage of the unit cell volume. Therefore,
it proves that Eu2+ and Tm3+ have already entered
the BASO lattice side-on.

Luminescence Property of the Single-Doped
Sample BASO:Eu2+
Figure 2a represents the photoluminescence (PL) and
photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) spectra of BASO:0.3Eu2+. By the excitation
of 380 nm ultraviolet light, the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+ shows
intense yellow fluorescence. The PL spectrum consists of the asymmetric
broad band with the main emission peak located at 580 nm and the wavelength
ranging from 450 to 750 nm, which belongs to the allowed transition
of 4f65d1 → 4f7.11 BASO:0.3Eu2+ can also be excited
by a light source with the wavelength ranging from 250 to 520 nm,
corresponding to 4f7 → 4f65d1 that allowed the transition of Eu2+.17 The PL spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu2+ consists of
the main emission peak located at 580 nm and a broad peak located
at 500 nm. The emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu2+ may be
the combination of multiple emission light of the Eu2+ ion.
The position and intensity of the emission wavelength located at different
lattice sites are different. Therefore, the asymmetric emission peak
of BASO:0.3Eu2+ is generated. In the matrix with multiple
crystal lattice sites, Eu2+ is usually preferred to occupy
the easily substituted Ba2+ ion site.18 With the increase in Eu2+ ionic concentration,
the occupied lattice sites will change. The PL spectra of samples
with different doping concentrations are shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) PL and PLE spectra
of BASO:0.3Eu2+. (b) Emission
spectra of BASO:xEu2+. (c) Emission spectra
of BASO:0.3Eu2+ at room temperature and low temperature.

Obviously, with the increase in
Eu2+ doping concentration,
the shape of the BASO:xEu2+ emission spectral
curve varies greatly. The BASO:xEu2+ emission
spectra consist of two emission peaks located at 500 and 580 nm. The
intensities of the two emission peaks are close. With the increase
in Eu2+ ionic concentration, the intensities of emission
peaks located at 500 and 580 nm increase simultaneously. The intensity
difference of the two emission peaks becomes larger and larger to
the extent that we can only observe one main emission peak located
at 580 nm in the emission spectrum of BASO:0.7Eu2+. To
research the luminescence characteristics of Eu2+ in the
BASO:Eu2+ material, we test the low-temperature excitation
and emission spectra. In the state of low temperature, the lattice
vibration and the energy exchange between Eu2+ ions have
a small influence on the transition emission of luminescent ions,
which, to some extent, can separate the emission spectra of luminescent
ions located at different lattice sites. In Figure 2c, the emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu2+ in room temperature consists of a main emission peak and
a weak peak located at 500 nm. Obviously, in a low temperature of
83 K, the emission spectra of BASO:0.3Eu2+ consist of two
emission peaks located at 505 and 580 nm, whose intensities are close.
This indicates that two kinds of Eu2+ ionic luminescence
center exist in BASO:Eu2+, whose emission peaks are located
at 500 and 580 nm. According to Van Uitert theory, we can assume that
the 5d orbital energy level of the Eu2+ ion in the same
material is mainly affected by the surrounding atom coordination number.
In the BASO:Eu2+ material, the Eu2+ ion has
only two coordination numbers (8 and 9). Thus, two different emission
wavelengths can possibly be produced. For this purpose, we analyze
the luminescence characteristics of Eu2+ ions located at
different lattice sites with the following equation19 1  where E is
the position of the Eu2+ emission peak, whose unit is cm–1, Q is the Eu2+ energy
level difference between d orbital and 4f orbital for the free ion, V is the valence of the activated ion (Eu2+), Ea is the electronic affinity of the coordination
atom, n is the coordination number of the activated
ion, and r is the radius of the matrix cation substituted
by the Eu2+ ion. For the BASO:Eu2+ material,
the coordination atom O is affected by SiO4 and AlO4 together. The value of Ea will
change. According to the equation above, in the situation of the same Ea value, when n is larger,
the value of E is larger, and the corresponding emission
wavelength is smaller. Therefore, the emission peak at 580 nm should
be generated by the eight-coordinated Eu2+ ion. Therefore,
we can estimate the value of the affinity energy of O in the material
according to the emission peak at 580 nm (the activated ion is Eu2+, Q = 34,000 cm–1, V = 2, the coordination number of Ba is 8, r = 0.142 nm, E ≈ 17,241.4 cm–1, and calculated Ea = 1.50 eV). We substitute
the calculated Ea into the equation (the
ionic coordination number of Ba is 9, r = 0.147 nm),
and E ≈ 20,284.0 cm–1 is
obtained, which corresponds to the 500 nm emission peak position of
the BASO:Eu2+ emission spectrum. This explains that there
are two kinds of Eu2+ ion luminescent center in the material.
The 500 and 580 nm emission peaks in the emission spectrum correspond
to the nine-coordinated and eight-coordinated Eu2+ ion
luminescent center, respectively.

Luminescence Property of
BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+
Figure 3a provides the excitation and emission spectra
of the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. By the excitation
of 365 nm ultraviolet
light, the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ can emit
intense yellow luminescence as well. The emission spectrum is a broad-band
spectrum ranging from 450 to 470 nm, which belongs to the 4f65d1 → 4f7 transition emission of Eu2+. The emission spectrum includes two emission peaks, which
are the main emission peak located at 580 nm and the weak emission
peak located at 500 nm. The co-doped sample is synthesized in the
reducing condition. Eu3+ has been reduced to Eu2+ (no 4f → 4f characteristic transition emission peak of Eu3+ observed around 610 nm).20 The
added Tm3+ ion is difficult to be reduced; therefore, it
still exists in a trivalent ion form.21 There is no characteristic emission peak of the Tm3+ ion
in the emission spectrum of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. Thus, in the co-doped sample, Tm3+ acts mainly as the
assistant activating agent rather than the luminescent center. The
two emission peak positions of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ are the same as the emission peak position of BASO:0.3Eu2+, which indicates that the crystal environment of the Eu2+ luminescent center does not change much after the Tm3+ ion is involved. As shown in Figure 3a, BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ can also
be excited by the light with the wavelength from 250 to 520 nm, belonging
to the 4f7 → 4f65d1 transition
of Eu2+. This declares that the sample can be activated
by ultraviolet and blue light-emitting diode (LED) chips, which is
very important for the application of long persistent luminescence
materials.

sunlight activation for 30 min. (d) Persistent luminescence decay
curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+ and BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.05Tm3+.

We use near ultraviolet light
or sunlight to irradiate BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+ for
some time. We can observe strong yellow
persistent luminescence in a dark room after the removal of light
source. The sample is irradiated under a 460 nm blue light source
for 1 min. The persistent luminescence spectra were tested after removing
the light source for 10 s, as shown in Figure 3b. The persistent luminescence spectrum of
BASO:0.3Eu2+,xTm3+ is in accordance
with its PL spectrum. Therefore, the persistent luminescence of BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+ derives from the 4f65d1 → 4f7 transition of Eu2+. Figure 3c shows the CIE chromaticity
coordinates of the persistent luminescence of BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+, and the persistent luminescence can last for 8
h. We observe that BASO:0.3Eu2+ can also emit yellow persistent
luminescence without adding the Tm3+ ion; however, the
intensity is weak. The persistent luminescence intensity of the sample
improves much after adding Tm3+. With the further increase
in Tm3+ concentration, the persistent luminescence intensity
of the sample increases gradually. However, when the Tm3+ concentration is above 0.1, the persistent luminescence intensity
of the sample decreases. This indicates that the addition of Tm3+ changes the trap distribution of the material and improves
the energy storage ability of the materials. With the addition of
Tm3+ ions, the amount of traps increases in the materials.
The persistent luminescence intensity increases therewith. When Tm3+ reaches a certain concentration, the co-doped ions cause
concentration quenching with the addition of the doped concentration,
which decreases the persistent luminescence intensity.

Figure 3d shows
the persistent luminescence decay curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+ and BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.05Tm3+. BASO:0.3Eu2+ possesses quite low initial persistent luminescence intensity
and will soon decay to the lower level. The co-doped BASO:0.3Eu2+,Tm3+ sample possesses a higher initial persistent
luminescence intensity. After decaying to a certain intensity level,
the decay of persistent luminescence becomes quite slow. Thus, it
can emit persistent luminescence for a long time. To study the decay
regularity of persistent luminescence, we fit the decay curves of
BASO:0.3Eu2+ and BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.05Tm3+ and find that the decay of persistent luminescence in accordance
with the second-order kinetic attenuation rule22−24 2  where I is
the persistent luminescence intensity of the sample, A1 and A2 are the constants,
and α1 and α2 represent the decay
constants, which reflect the decay rate to some extent. To the sample
BASO:0.3Eu2+, α1 = 0.0575 and α2 = 0.0086. To the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+, α1 = 0.0413 and α2 =
0.0042. It can thus be seen that the numerical value of α1 and α2 to the co-doped sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.05Tm3+ is smaller than BASO:0.3Eu2+, which indicates that the Tm3+ ion not only improves
the persistent luminescence intensity of BASO: Eu2+ but
also decreases the persistent luminescence decay rate.

Thermoluminescence
Spectra of the Sample
In the long-lasting
phosphor activated by Eu2+, co-doped trivalent rare-earth
ions are frequently non-luminescent. Instead, they store energy as
a trap center and gradually release the energy at the function of
temperature. They transmit the energy to the Eu2+ luminescent
center to generate persistent luminescence. The intensity of persistent
luminescence and the time of duration are frequently decided by the
existing state of the trap. To research the generating process of
the persistent luminescence and the function of Tm3+ in
BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+, we test the three-dimensional
thermoluminescence spectra of the sample.

Figure 4a shows the three-dimensional thermoluminescence
spectra of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. The X axis represents the luminescence wavelength. The Y axis represents the temperature. Z axis
represents the intensity of thermoluminescence. The XZ plane is the thermoluminescence spectra of the sample at different
temperatures and the persistent luminescence emission spectra at one
temperature. The YZ plane is the relationship curve
of the temperature and emission intensity monitoring at one temperature.
Converting the three-dimensional thermoluminescence spectra of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ to the two-dimensional thermoluminescence
curve about the emission intensity and temperature using software,
we obtain Figure 4b.
We use thermoluminescence analysis software to deal with the two-dimensional
thermoluminescence curve of the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. We obtain the relative parameters of thermoluminescence
by software fitting of the curves. Because of the uncertainty of the
thermoluminescence dynamic series, the theory we use to fit is based
on the general dynamic series calculation equation:25 3  In the equation, E is the activated energy or the deepness of the trap, n0 is the density of charge captured in the trap
when t = 0, which directly affects the intensity
of thermoluminescence, k is the Boltzmann constant
(k = 1.38 ×
10–23 J/K), s is the frequency
factor, l is the dynamic series, β is the heating
rate, and β = 4 K/s. Table 1 shows the fitting result of the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. The two-dimensional thermoluminescence
curve can be fitted to break up into two thermoluminescence peaks.
The low-temperature peak is located at 326 K. The corresponding trap
deepness values are 0.62 and 0.70 eV. If the peak position of thermoluminescence
is too low, the decay of persistent luminescence is very fast, and
the time of duration is short. If the peak position of thermoluminescence
is too high, the storage energy is difficult to be released in room
temperature, and the persistent luminescence is weak. Thus, the thermoluminescence
peak position of the better persistent luminescence material should
be in the range of 320 and 393 K (about 0.65 eV).10

curves.

Table 1 Thermoluminescence
Fitting Parameters
of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+
peak	E (eV)	s (s–1)	Tm (K)	n0 (cm–3)	l	
1	0.62	9.62 × 108	326	2.95 × 107	1.96	
2	0.70	7.70 × 108	363	2.05 × 107	1.98	
There are two thermoluminescence peaks located at
326 and 363 K
to the sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+. Thus, the
two thermoluminescence peaks both make contributions to the persistent
luminescence property of the sample. Also, the thermoluminescence
curve is a broad-band curve and can cover the temperature region from
300 to 450 K. This indicates that the distribution of traps in the
material is wide. Generally, it is believed that the release rate
of energy in the shallow trap is quick, the release rate of energy
in the deep trap is slow, and the duration time is long. From Table 1, we can see that
the density of charge carrier captured in the shallow trap and deep
trap is basically close, which indicates that BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ possesses not only the high intensity of persistent
luminescence but also the long persistent luminescence duration time.

Figure 5a shows
the two-dimensional thermoluminescence curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+,yTm3+ (y = 0, 0.05,
0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40). With the increase in Tm3+ concentration,
the intensity of persistent luminescence increases gradually. When y = 0.10, the thermoluminescence curve reaches the maximum.
After continuously adding Tm3+, the intensity of thermoluminescence
decreases with it. The possible reason may be the concentration quenching
owing to the excessive Tm3+ concentration. The storage
energy returns to the ground state in the form of non-radiative transitions.
Besides, although the persistent luminescence of BASO:0.3Eu2+ can be detected, its persistent luminescence property is poor. The
thermoluminescence curve shape of BASO:0.3Eu2+ is similar
to that of BASO:0.3Eu2+,yTm3+, as shown in Figure 5a. Besides, with the addition of Tm3+ , the peak edge
of thermoluminescence slightly moves to the high temperature, which
indicates that adding Tm3+ ions not only can increase the
amount of traps in BASO:0.3Eu2+ but also can interact and
increase the deepness of traps to some extent.

Figure 5 (a) Two-dimensional thermoluminescence
curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+,yTm3+ (y =
0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40). (b) Thermoluminescence curves
of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ at different excitation
light. (c) Thermoluminescence curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1RE3+.

Figure 5b shows
the thermoluminescence curves of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ at different excitation light. Generally, the wavelength
of the excitation light is shorter, the energy is higher, and the
rate of the energy storage is faster. However, the thermoluminescence
intensity of the sample excited by a 250 nm light source is the lowest.
With the increase in the excitation light wavelength, the intensity
of thermoluminescence curve increases gradually. The thermoluminescence
curve is the strongest at the excitation of a 460 nm light source.
However, the main excitation peak of BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1Tm3+ excitation spectra is located at around 380 nm. According
to the analysis above, we can assume that the trap in the material
has its own energy level distribution, and the lowest trap level must
be lower than the bottom level of the d band of Eu2+ in
the material, so that the persistent luminescence property of the
sample is better when excited by the blue light with lower energy.

In the process of the preparation of BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+, the mixture of rare-earth ions and the change in the matrix
both result in the generation of the defects. Because the ionic radii
of Eu2+ and Tm3+ are more close to Ba2+, the doping Eu2+ and Tm3+ ions in the lattice
mainly substitute the position of Ba2+. The ionic solid-phase
reaction chemical formula of the Eu2+ and Tm3+ ions doped into the matrix is as follows: 4  Eu2+ doped into
the lattice is a kind of equivalent substitution process. The lattice
defect EuBa× is generated after the substitution of Ba2+ without charge.
Tm3+ that entered the lattice is a kind of non-equivalent
substitution process. Point defect TmBa• is generated after the substitution
of Ba2+ with positive charge. To balance the charge of
the crystal, one Ba ion vacancy VBa″ with two negative charges will be generated
when two Tm3+ ions enter the lattice. Reducing the synthetic
atmosphere makes some O ions react with the reducing gas and break
away. Thus, there exists O ion vacancy VO•• in the synthetic material.26 EuBa× is electrically neutral. Tm3+ (TmBa•) bears one positive charge. VBa″ bears two negative charges. VO•• bears two positive charges. Eu2+, as the luminescent
center in EuBa×, mainly affects the photoluminescence property and persistent luminescence
color of the material. VBa″ bears two negative charges, which can
act as the vacancy trap in the material. Owing to the positive charge
of Tm3+ (TmBa•) and VO•• defects, they are able to serve as the electron
capture trap.

Persistent Luminescence Mechanism for BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+
We have already analyzed the existing
defects in
BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+ in detail. To understand the
function of different kinds of defects to the persistent luminescence
of materials better, we prepared the other co-doped trivalent rare-earth
ion series sample BASO:0.3Eu2+,0.1RE3+ and characterized
them with the thermoluminescence curve. In Figure 5c, after co-doping Tm3+, Dy3+, Nd3+, La3+, Tb3+, Ce3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Er3+, and Lu3+ ions, the intensities of thermoluminescence
all increase. In the above order, the influence of trivalent rare-earth
ions to the persistent luminescence property of BASO:0.3Eu2+ decreases gradually. After co-doping Sm3+ and Yb3+ ions, the thermoluminescence intensity of the sample decreases
on the contrary. Besides, a single-doped sample also possesses a persistent
luminescence phenomenon. This indicated that traps exist in BASO:0.3Eu2+, which can store energy. Therefore, the energy storage center
of the sample may be generated by VBa″ and VO•• in the lattice.

The amount
of VBa″ will be improved in the sample after adding RE3+ ions.
Thus, the improvement of the persistent luminescence intensity is
possibly due to the increase in the amount of VBa″. However, different RE3+ ions affect the persistent luminescence of BASO:0.3Eu2+ differently. Besides, the addition of Sm3+ and
Yb3+ decreases the thermoluminescence intensity of the
material, which indicates that the increase in the amount of VBa″ is not
the main factor that affects thermoluminescence. Therefore, it can
be deduced that Tm3+ ions interact with the defects in
the material. VO•• and Tm3+ in the material can both act as the electron
trap. Tm3+ can improve the ability of the electron capture
in the material, thus improve its persistent luminescence intensity.
By observing the thermoluminescence intensity changing law (Figure 5c), we discover that
the influence of RE3+ ions on the thermoluminescence intensity
is closely related to the optical electronegativity of the rare-earth
ions. The so-called optical electronegativity is the parameter of
the ability that rare-earth ions attract electrons. The electronegativity
is bigger, and the ability to attract electron is stronger. On the
contrary, the ability to attract electron is smaller. Co-doped RE3+ ions can interact with other defects to capture an excited
electron. Thus, the co-doped RE3+ ions can improve the
energy storage ability of the material and then improve the persistent
luminescence property of the material. Tm3+, Dy3+, and Nd3+ ions improve the thermoluminescence intensity
of the material drastically. The improvement of La3+, Tb3+, Ce3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+ ions
to the thermoluminescence intensity of the material is not obvious.
After adding Sm3+ and Yb3+ ions, the thermoluminescence
intensity of the material decreases on the contrary. This indicates
that RE3+ ions can improve the persistent luminescence
intensity of the material within its optical electronegativity in
an appropriate range. If the optical electronegativity is too small,
then it cannot capture an electron with other defects effectively.
If the optical electronegativity is too large, then the ability of
absorption of electron is too strong to release the captured electron
in the material. In this material, Sm3+ and Yb3+ ions possess large optical electronegativity. The captured electron
cannot be released effectively, which leads to the decrease of thermoluminescence
intensity in BASO:0.3Eu2+. The optical electronegativity
of La3+, Tb3+, Ce3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+ ions is too small. They obviously cannot improve
the thermoluminescence intensity of the sample.

We propose a
persistent luminescence mechanism for BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+, as shown in Figure 6. After Eu2+ is activated by the
light source, electrons transition from the ground state 4f orbital
to the 5d orbital and become excited electrons. Then, they are captured
by the electron trap. The captured electrons are activated again to
the 5d orbital of Eu2+ ion under the action of temperature.
The electrons in the 5d orbital transition to the 4f orbital and generate
yellow persistent luminescence. According to the discussion above,
the intensity of persistent luminescence excited by a 460 nm light
source is higher than the intensity excited by a 254 nm light source.
Besides, the energy of a 460 nm light source is lower than the conduction
band. This indicates that the captured excited electrons do not transmit
by the conduction band but may directly transmit from the 5d orbital
to deflect the energy level by the tunneling effect. Also, by thermal
activation, the
captured electrons directly transmit to the Eu2+ luminescence
center without passing the conduction band. Thus, the sample irradiated
under the light source with lower energy can generate stronger persistent
luminescence.

BASO:Eu2+,Tm3+.

Conclusions
By the high-temperature solid-state method,
we synthesized a yellow
long persistent luminescence phosphor Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+. The Rietveld analysis
shows that Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ has the same orthorhombic crystal structure with
Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70. The Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+ phosphors
can be efficiently activated by sunlight and ultraviolet light and
exhibited excellent yellow long persistent luminescence. The persistent
luminescence can be observed after 8 h in a dark room. By thermoluminescence
spectra, we realize the trap distribution of Ba13.35Al30.7Si5.3O70:Eu2+,Tm3+. Also, the
corresponding mechanism of persistent luminescence has been illustrated.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of the Sample
All the samples in this paper
were prepared by a high-temperature solid-phase reaction. The raw
materials needed were BaCO3 (A.R.), Al2O3 (A.R.), SiO2 (A.R.), Eu2O3 (99.99%), H3BO3, and RexOy (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm,
Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) (99.99%). The chemical composition
of the sample was Ba(13.35–x–y)Al30.7Si5.3O70:xEu2+,yRE3+ (denoted
as BASO:xEu2+,yRE3+, where x and y are the
molar fractions of the dopant).

The abovementioned material
as the stoichiometric ratio of the target compound was weighed accurately.
H3BO3 (5 mol % of Ba element) was added as the
co-solvent. The weighing raw material was placed into an agate mortar,
ground, and blended for 15 min. The intensively mixed raw material
was placed into an alumina crucible. Then, the crucible with the sample
was put into a big crucible filled with activated carbon. The reaction
temperature was 1653 K. The sample was calcined in the furnace in
1653 K for 6 h. After the reaction, the sample was cooled to room
temperature in the furnace. The obtained samples were ground into
powder for the following measurement.

Measurements and Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 focus diffractometer at
a scanning rate of 2°·min–1 in the 2θ
range from 10° to 90°, with graphite-monochromatized Cu
Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) operating at
40 kV and 40 mA. The photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) spectra of the obtained materials were recorded by
a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp
as the excitation source. The persistent luminescence spectra and
intensity decay curves were also measured using the same instrument
after the samples were irradiated under 365 nm UV light for 2 min.
The thermoluminescence curves were measured with a homemade spectrum
instrument mainly consisting of a CCD detector and a heating apparatus.
The sample was placed in a homemade sample holder and heated from
room temperature to 413 K at a speed of 4 K·s–1. The sun irradiation experiments were carried out in a sunny day
(11 a.m.), and the photographs were taken in a dark room.
