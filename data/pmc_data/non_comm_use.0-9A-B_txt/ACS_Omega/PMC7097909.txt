Peptides
are used as reagents both for basic research and diagnostic
purposes. Therefore, there is a need for novel methods for the design
of peptide molecules with a particular specific physiochemical profile.
The properties of the peptides are governed by the nature of amino
acids constituting the peptide. There is a lack of a web server or
tools which could predict all the possible combinations of the peptides
generated because of the combinations of amino acids based on the
physiochemical properties. We have developed a peptide combination
generator (PepCoGen), a web server for generating all the possible
combinations of peptides by varying the amino acids having similar
physiochemical properties at a particular position. It also predicts
other properties of the peptides including molecular weight, charge,
solubility, hydrophobic plot, and isoelectric point, and random three-dimensional
models for each generated combination.

==== Body
Introduction
In
the past decade, peptides have gained diverse applications in
both medicine and biotechnology; moreover, the therapeutic peptide
research has experienced revolution because of commercial reasons.
Peptide sequences are constituents of bigger proteins, where they
assist in molecular recognition and various biological functions by
acting as precursors for proteins,1 alkaloids,2 hormones,3 anti-malarial
agents,4 antimicrobial agents,5−7 anti-oxidants,8 anti-neurodegenerative,9 immunogens,10 and
many more.11 Inhibition of protein–protein
interactions by peptides and thereby therapeutic intervention of various
disease-causing pathways have been the key for peptide drug design.12 Moreover, owing to their high specificity, safety,
tolerability, efficacy, and excellent pharmacological profile, peptides
seem to be ideal drug leads.13 There are
more than 60 FDA-approved peptide drugs in the market, and more than
150 peptide drugs are in clinical trials and more than 500 therapeutic
peptides in preclinical development.14,15 Numerous peptides
including insulin, calcitonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin have been
used as therapeutic peptides.13,15 Similarly, peptides
from snake venom have been used for therapeutic purposes.16 There has been an increase in the development
of combinatorial methods for discovery of membrane-active peptides17 and cell-permeable bicyclic peptides.18 Similarly, there has also been an increase in
computational methods for the prediction of therapeutic peptides,11,19,20 peptide structure,21,22 peptide docking,23 and peptide binding.24 Peptide libraries are routinely used as a powerful
tool in biological research.25 They provide
a quick and economical solution for a wide range of bioactivity screening
purposes and identifying bioactive peptides. Dedicated libraries are
ideal for “T-cell epitope mapping and searching”. Overlapping
linear peptide libraries provide a rapid route to mapping of the linear
or complex epitope of the antibody. Peptide libraries are also used
as enzyme substrates, ligands, or inhibitors in biochemical studies.
The 20 amino acids can be differentiated into six broad groups, namely,
hydrophobic (aliphatic), aromatic, basic, acidic, unique, and polar
uncharged based on their physiochemical properties26−28 (Table S1). Currently, there is no standalone
tool or web server, which could generate all the possible combination
of the peptides by varying or mutating the amino acids with other
residues having similar properties at a particular position in the
peptide sequence. To predict all such combinations for the peptide,
we have developed a user-friendly web server, which can be freely
accessed at https://www.bicfri.in/pepcogen/. The front end of the web server is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Image indicates the main
web server front page, which can be used
to access both basic and advanced modules of the web server.

Results and Discussion
The basic
module only calculates the total combinations along with
the peptide sequence, while the advanced modules calculate the physiochemical
properties for all the combinations as well. Peptides of length 4
to 21 residues have been explored, as mostly the wet lab synthesis
of peptides has been focused on developing peptides of these lengths.
The peptide length can be increased, but the computational cost of
calculating all the physiochemical properties was found to be high
for such peptides. Therefore, we restricted the length of peptides
to this range. In both basic and advanced modules, after initially
selecting the sequence of the peptide fragment ranging from 4 to 21
amino acids (see Figures S1–S3),
a drop-down menu will pop up asking the user to select the desired
amino acids having the selected physiochemical property for each position
in the peptide (Figure S4). After submitting
the request on the front end, all the possible combinations of the
peptide sequences based on the selected properties are calculated
for both the modules (Figure S5). For example,
for calculating the number of combinations for the peptide having
sequence length 6 and having the possibility of acidic amino acids
for positions 1 and 2, basic amino acids for positions 3 and 4, and
hydrophobic amino acids for positions 5 and 6, the total possible
combinations generated were 900, which were displayed on the browser
window of the client end. For the advanced module (which is limited
for generating combinations of up to 0.1 million), all the combinations
are listed along with the calculated physiochemical properties including
molecular weight, isoelectric point, charge, solubility, and hydropathy
index, and a random 3D model (Figure S6). For instance, for calculating the combinations for the peptide
with length 5, having the possibility of hydrophobic residues at all
positions, we generated 3125 combinations (Figure S7). The hydropathy index is displaced in a new window along
with its average value (Figure S8). The
models can be generated, by clicking on the model icon in the corresponding
tab, in a separate window using the JSmol library (Figure S9). However, the 3D models were generated accurately
for the peptides having a length of up to 8 amino acids. Methods described
previously were found to be more accurate22,23 and can be used for generating models using the string format generated
for each combination.

Conclusions
We introduce a user-friendly
web server tool, peptide combination
generator (PepCoGen), which is the first freeware to assist the researchers
in creating all the possible combinations of the peptide sequence
by the variation of amino acids having similar physiochemical properties.
The peptide combinations generated for a particular peptide sequence
can be used by the researchers in making crucial decisions for selecting
peptide sequences. The decision for selecting the peptides could be
based on their molecular weight, charge, isoelectric point, and hydropathy
index. Furthermore, by conserving the critical residues, all the possible
combinations based on the physiochemical profile can be used to design
analogues for sequence optimizations. Custom peptide libraries can
be shortlisted, which have widespread applications in identifying
critical amino acid residues, designing analogues, identifications
of more potent peptide-based drugs, and many more. The web server
could be used for the design of virtual peptide library databases,
which further have numerous applications.

Computational Methods
The web server “PepCoGen” is organized as the REST
architecture, with the front end of the server for the user interface
and the back end for the algorithm scripts. The front end was designed
using HTML, CSS, JQUERY, AJAX, and BOOTSTRAP, while the back end scripts
were written in PHP. The physiochemical properties of the peptides
including molecular mass, charge, solubility, and isoelectric point
(at pH 7) were calculated using scripts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively,
described in the Supporting Information (scripts s1, s2, s3, and s4). The hydropathy index was calculated
using script 5, described in the Supporting Information (script s5). The models were generated using JSmol plugin.29 PepCoGen was implemented in PHP language, and
the complete workflow has been described in Figure 2. PepCoGen is an easy-to-use tool to generate
combinations for peptide lengths ranging from 4 to 21 residues and
has widespread practical applications. The tool has been divided into
basic and advanced modules. The basic module only calculates and reports
all the combinations in the screen. The advanced module can calculate
combinations up to 0.1 million peptides, along with the other features
including molecular weight, charge, solubility, isoelectric point,
and hydropathy index, and generate a random 3D model for each peptide.
For calculating the isoelectric point, computationally optimized dissociation
constant (pKa) values of amino acids were
used.30 For calculating the hydropathy
index values, the Hoops and Woods method was used as the values calculated
could be useful in developing synthetic peptide immunogens and for
understanding the relationship of the peptide sequence and its interaction
with macromolecules.31 Models for each
peptide were built using JSmol plugin. For the advanced module, the
results can be viewed in the screen in batches of 10, 25, 50, and
100 per page. The results can also be downloaded in the excel sheet
and pdf format.
