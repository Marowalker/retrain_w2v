A class of high molecular
weight polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified
zeolite 13X adsorbents were synthesized by varying the concentration
of imines and screened for preliminary investigation of CO2 capture studies. The impregnated molecular amine zeolite composite
was characterized and CO2 adsorption performance was investigated
through TGA in the presence of atmospheric pure CO2 gas
at 25, 50, 75, and 100 °C, respectively, using 20–80 wt
% of PEI-loaded zeolite 13X adsorbents. This paper reports on the
effects of temperature and amine (PEI) loading on CO2 adsorption
capacity and estimated kinetic parameters through modeling of selected
models which represent the reaction rate and diffusion rate models.
The studied adsorbents showed the highest adsorption capacity at 75
°C with 60 wt % PEI loading. Thus, the optimum temperature of
75 °C and optimal loading of 60 wt % was observed from the current
studies for CO2 capture. From modeling study, it was found
that Avrami’s fractional order and dual kinetic models (DKM)
described well the adsorption behavior of CO2 on PEI-impregnated
zeolite 13X at all temperatures accurately and up to 75 °C, respectively.
Besides, intraparticle diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting
step when compared with the film diffusion model.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal
facilitates security and access for energy in most developed
and developing economies throughout the world but symbolizes the major
source of carbon emissions which is threatening to the climate system.
In spite of the implementation of recent environmental policies of
some developed countries for reduction in coal use, the world is still
mostly depending on to coal, which is primarily used for electricity
generation and, to some extent, for the production of cement, chemicals,
steel, and liquid fuels.1,2 To use coal in a sustainable
manner in the coming future, there is a need for developing a technology
which reduces the associated CO2 emissions from coal power
plants, and this can be achieved through the execution of carbon capture,
utilization, and storage technologies.3−6

Postcombustion capture-based technology
is considered widely for
carbon dioxide capture from flue gases. In this technology, CO2 from flue gas is captured after the fossil fuel has been
burned. There are four pathways to capture CO2 under post-combustion
technology, which are absorption, adsorption, cryogenic distillation,
and membrane purification.7 Among the varied
pathways, the most matured technology to separate CO2 from
flue gas is absorption based, wherein liquid amines are circulated
in adsorption and stripping column in a cycle. Nevertheless, this
pathway using liquid amine has been used for CO2 capture
industrially for decades, has a number of defects such as intense
corrosive nature of amines on equipment and high-energy requirement
for the regeneration of amine solution.8 Therefore, to get over from their limitations, adsorption is chosen
as one of the most likely routes because of the relatively less energy
requirement, lower cost involved in adsorbent preparation, and wider
applicability in terms of operating temperature and pressures. There
are plenty of materials that have been studied for CO2 adsorption
such as zeolite,9 metal–organic
frameworks,10 activated carbon,11,12 alkaline metal oxides,13,14 and amine–silica
hybrid/composite adsorbents.15 Amid these
adsorbents, zeolite has been investigated mostly and especially zeolite
13X, which has been regarded as a benchmark material for CO2 capture because of its high CO2 adsorption capacity.
In spite of this feature, zeolite is found to be more effective at
ambient temperature as physical adsorption is more predominant in
these materials and less effective at higher temperatures. In view
of this drawback and to make zeolite operational at higher temperatures
and near atmospheric pressures (real flue gas conditions), suitable
amine-modified/-impregnated zeolite is prepared and tested for their
capacity in this present study, as these prepared materials would
act as a hybrid adsorbent, wherein both physisorption and chemisorption
would take place.16

The studies on
amine-modified adsorbents have earned significant
attention in CO2 capture research area because of its simple
chemistry involved between the acidic CO2 molecule and
basic amine molecule impregnated on the solid surface. Majority of
the research has been focused on improving the CO2 adsorption
capacity and selection of relevant amine for surface modification.
There has been substantial research progressing in the area of basic
amine groups and zeolite.17−20 Recently, diverse amines have been used in the synthesis
of amine–zeolite adsorbents, including monoethanolamine (MEA),
tetraethylenepentamine, polyethylenimines (PEIs), an so forth. Jadhav
et al.16 studied adsorption capacities
of impregnated MEA onto zeolite 13X-based adsorbents in the temperature
range of 30–120 °C. The sorbents exhibited betterment
in CO2 adsorption capacity over the pristine zeolite by
a factor of 1.6 at 30 °C and at 120 °C by a factor of 3.5
in CO2 capture efficiency. Chen et al.21 modified 13X zeolite by using a mesopore-generating agent
and then with PEI800MW. It is found that the mesoporous
13X zeolite showed better CO2 capture capacity and selectivity
at high temperature (e.g., 100 °C) with dilute CO2 concentrations.

In recent research, PEI has drawn great attention
in CO2 capture study using different supports because of
its easily synthesizable
property, relatively less cost and lastly because of its high thermal
stability when compared with other amines.22 Li et al. has considered the influence of the PEI type (linear or
branched) and molecular weight on the CO2 capture performance.
It was observed that the CO2 adsorption capacity diminished
with the increasing PEI molecular weight, and branched PEIs had higher
sorption capacities than linear PEIs because of their greater mobility.
It was also found that branched PEI of 800 molecular weight with the
silica support showed highest CO2 sorption capacity of
202 mg of CO2/g of the adsorbent at 105 °C under pure
CO2 atmosphere.23

In the
present work, (PEI600000MW) of higher molecular
weight is impregnated on 13X zeolite to study its adsorption capacity
and kinetics. It is expected that this novel adsorbent would adsorb
better than pristine zeolite, especially at higher temperatures. This
study could be considered as preliminary experimentation on higher
molecular weight amine-impregnated zeolite for CO2 adsorption
at atmospheric pressures along with the kinetic modeling studies for
this particular class of sorbents. Amine impregnation on zeolite is
verified through prominent characterization techniques.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The
amine used in the synthesis
of the adsorbent was of analytical grade PEI solution (∼50%
in H2O) of molecular weight ranging between 600 000
and 1 000 000, which was procured from Sigma-Aldrich,
India, and was used as such without any further purification. The
solvent used was methanol procured from Finar Limited, India, was
distilled to obtain anhydrous methanol for adsorbent preparation.
Zeolite 13X powder of nearly 2 μm average particle size was
procured from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas
cylinders were purchased from Vijay Enterprises, Secunderabad, Telangana,
India.

2.2 Synthesis of Amine-Immobilized Adsorbents
PEI was anchored on commercial zeolite 13X through a physical impregnation
method as mentioned by Xu et al.24 and
the schematic representation of the preparation method is shown in Figure 1. The immobilization
of amine (PEI) on zeolite was carried out using an alcoholic solution
of amine. A given amount of amine was dissolved in distilled methanol
and stirred for 30 min. The zeolite of 1 g quantity was added to this
alcoholic solution and the resulting slurry was stirred continuously
for 24 h. A solid–liquid ratio of 1:2 was maintained during
the adsorbent’s preparation. The amine solution was then filtered
and the modified zeolite slurry was dried in an oven at 70 °C
for 3–4 h. The prepared adsorbents were named as 13X-PEI-n, where n represents the loading of PEI
as the weight percentage in the sample.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of adsorbent preparation.

2.3 Sorbent Characterization
Different
characterization techniques were considered to obtain a useful comparison
between amine-modified and -unmodified zeolite 13X. Those techniques
were N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermo-gravimetric
analysis (TGA), and elemental (CHNS) analysis.

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms were measured using an Autosorb apparatus for the determination
of textural properties such as surface area (SBET), total pore volume (VTOTAL), and mean pore volume (VMEAN). The
impregnated adsorbents were initially outgassed at 423 K, to avoid
amine volatilization, and then subjected to stepwise N2 gas at 77 K. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed using the
TA Instruments SDT Q600 apparatus to study the thermal stability of
the synthesized adsorbents and even to determine the amine loading.
Around 15–20 mg of the sample was placed in theTG pan and was
heated at a rate 10 °C/min in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen
gas. The samples were heated starting from 25 to 1000 °C. The
adsorbent’s weight loss was recorded. The FTIR spectra of the
prepared materials were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670
spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. The wavelength region
of 4000–400 cm–1 was considered for analysis.
A diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.54 Å) was considered for powder X-ray diffraction
studies. The total carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and sulphur content
were determined using a CHNS analyzer of the Elementar Vario MICRO
cube model. SEM analysis is carried out using a Hitachi S-3000N SEM
to study the morphology of the samples. TEM analysis is carried on
FEI of Talos make.

2.4 Kinetics
2.4.1 Adsorption Kinetics
Through kinetic
analysis, gas adsorption rate defines the residence time required
for completeness of the adsorption reaction. The mathematical models
which define the adsorption data can be classified as adsorption reaction
models and adsorption diffusion models.27 Though both categories of models describe the kinetic process of
adsorption, they represent the different nature of the kinetic analysis.
In case of reaction models, experimental data would be fitted with
differential equations like pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order,
and so forth, which helps in knowing the reaction order and rate constants.
At present, more evolved reaction models are developed to describe
the kinetic process of adsorption, whereas adsorption diffusion models
are based on three consecutive steps: (a) external diffusion or film
diffusion, that is, diffusion across the gas film surrounding the
adsorbent particle, (b) internal diffusion or intraparticle diffusion,
that is, diffusion of gas in the pores and/or along the pore walls
and (c) mass action, that is, adsorption and desorption between the
gas molecules and active sites.

In the current study of kinetics,
we have considered linear driving force model (LDF), Avrami’s
fractional order, and dual kinetic model (DKM) under reaction models
category whereas Boyd and intraparticle diffusion models under diffusion
models.

2.4.1.1 Linear Driving Force Model
The
LDF is the most common and widely used equation for gas-solids systems
and was assumed to follow first-order kinetics.28 The model is represented by eq 1. 1  where qe and qt are the adsorption capacity
at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, and k1 is mass transfer constant. For the boundary conditions qt = 0 at t = 0 and qt = qe at t = ∞ the integrated
form of eq 2 becomes 2  

2.4.1.2 Avrami’s Fractional Order Kinetic
Model
This model is developed to simulate phase transition
and crystal growth of materials. However, it can also be considered
to describe the adsorption of CO2 on amine-functionalized
adsorbents. The differential form of this model is as follows29 3  where nA is the
Avrami exponent and kA is the Avrami kinetic
constant. The Avrami exponent, nA, is
a fractional number, which speculates mechanism changes that may take
place during the adsorption process. Here, nA is the dimensionality of growth of adsorption sites: nA = 2 for one-dimensional growth, nA = 3 for two dimensional growth, and nA = 4 for three-dimensional growth. For homogeneous adsorption
in which the probability of the adsorption to occur is equal for any
region for a given time interval, nA =
1. The integrated form of the above equation is 4  

2.4.1.3 Dual
Kinetic Model
It is a new
semi-empirical model which is particularly considered for amine-functionalized
solid materials, wherein several overlying processes which influence
the adsorption kinetics are taken into consideration.30 According to this model, the overall adsorption qt is the combination of surface qsur and bulk sorption qbulk 5  

Then, the time derivative is given
as follows 6  Here, qsur is
defined as the CO2 uptake at the surface and qbulk as the CO2 adsorption in the bulk phase
of the sorbent. Both terms correspond to physisorption and chemisorption
at varied sites within the amine layer. As adsorption can be described
as a reaction of higher order, kinetics of surface sorption can be
depicted using a fractional-order kinetic approach 7  

Besides surface sorption, the physical and chemisorbed CO2 molecules can further react with active sites present on
the bulk
amine layer and these interactions can be accounted as follows 8  

Combining equations eqs 7 and 8 we get 9  

On rearranging the above equation, we drive our dual kinetic
model 10  where, kDKM is
the constant for the dual kinetic model βDKM is the
ratio of kbulk and ksur. This model is solved using Euler’s numerical method
as the derived DKM model equation is a first-order first-degree differential
equation with an initial value of qt = 0 at t = 0.

2.4.1.4 Boyd
Model
Boyd developed a model
to understand whether film diffusion or intraparticle diffusion is
the rate-controlling step in adsorption kinetics.31 This model is based on the assumption that the boundary
layer on the adsorbent surface has a significant effect on the diffusion
of a gas. This effect is determined as follows 11  Here, F is the fraction
of
CO2 gas adsorbed at time t (qt) to CO2 gas adsorbed at
an infinite time, that is, at equilibrium (qe). Bt is a mathematical
function of F and it is calculated using the integrated
Fourier transform of eqs 13 and 14. 12   13   14  

The rate-limiting step is
predicted
by the plotting Bt versus t. If the plot shows linearity with the graph passing through
the origin, then the rate-limiting step is considered to be intraparticle
diffusion, otherwise the film diffusion model governs the process.
The slope of the Bt versus t graphs passing through origin represents the time constant
value, that is, B, using which the effective diffusion
coefficient (Di) can
be calculated at different temperatures using the following equation. 15  Here, r is the radius of
the adsorbent particle.

2.4.1.5 Intraparticle Diffusion
Model
Weber–Morris found this model and is applicable
in many adsorption
cases. According to this model, gas uptake (qt) varies proportionally with half power raised
to time (t1/2). 16  Here, kint is
the intraparticle diffusion rate constant.

As per this model,
the graph of qt versus t1/2 should be linear passing through the origin
for considering intraparticle diffusion as the rate-controlling step.
If the graph does not pass through the origin, then it is an indication
that different mechanisms may control the rate of adsorption which
may be operating simultaneously along with intraparticle diffusion.
From this model, the diffusion coefficient for intraparticle diffusion
of gas adsorption within the pores of amine-modified zeolite can be
calculated by employing the following equation.32 17  where Dp is the
diffusion coefficient (cm2/s), t1/2 is the time (s) for half-adsorption of CO2 on adsorbent,
and r is the average radius of the adsorbent particle
in cm. The value of r is taken as 2 × 10–4 cm for the current study.

2.4.2 Desorption Kinetics
Desorption
is equally important along with adsorption for the design of temperature
or pressure swing adsorption processes as it is contributing to the
total energy consumption, that is, heating and/or vacuum and its kinetic
analysis demonstrates the time required for complete regeneration
of a process. Desorption kinetic modeling studies are addressed by
very few researchers to date. Few of the models which were investigated
and considered for the present class of the adsorbent are as follows.

2.4.2.1 First-Order Model
Generally,
CO2 desorption obeys first-order kinetics and its expression
is represented as follows.33 18  Here, qdes is
the mass of CO2 desorbed at time t and qo is the mass of CO2 at maximum adsorption,
and kdes is the desorption rate constant.

2.4.2.2 Avrami’s Model
This model
is studied particularly for amine-functionalized materials and it
can be described by the following equation30 19  Here, Θ represents
the ratio of the
current loading during desorption qt,Des and the loading at the end of the adsorption step qt,Ads.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Sorbent Characterisation
SEM and
TEM images of pristine zeolite 13X and modified zeolite 13X image
varied compositions of amine is presented in Figure S1. From SEM analysis, the images reflect a crystal-like surface
morphology. It was observed that there is no significant change before
and after impregnation which indicates that PEI impregnation did not
change much of the morphology of the zeolite. The zeolite 13X image
resembled well with that of the reported image found in the literature,34 whereas, from TEM images, it is observed
that a PEI based molecular layer was laid on solid surface of modified
zeolite and along with observed depleted crystallinity in the modified
phase (Figure S1c,d). Infrared spectra
(Figure S2) showed that the samples have
both amines and zeolite features, indicating that PEI was impregnated
considerably in zeolite 13X. XRD spectra (Figure S3) show several Bragg peaks at angles between 2° to 40°
2θ degree which is typical for any zeolite material. After the
PEI was loaded, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the zeolite
13X reduced substantially, which was presumably induced by the PEI’s
dense layer formation on the surface of zeolite 13X.

3.1.1 N2 Adsorption/Desorption Isotherms
Figure 2 shows the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the zeolite
13X and 60 wt % PEI-modified zeolite 13X (13X-PEI-60). Zeolite 13X
showed typical Type I isotherm as per the IUPAC classification with
most microporous features as found out by the high volume of N2 adsorption at very low relative pressures. As the synthesis
is carried out by physical impregnation, it is more likely that a
thick layer of PEI molecules would have been engulfed over the zeolite
13X surface which could prevent N2 sorption at low temperatures
of 77 K. The corresponding textural properties of the samples are
tabulated in Table 1.

of 13X-PEI-60.

3.1.2 Thermo-Gravimetric
Analysis
Figure S4 depicts the
thermal behavior of pristine
zeolite 13X and amine impregnated zeolite 13X measured by TGA under
dry N2 environment. The samples were heated from 25 to
800 °C by a speed of 10 °C per min. As can be seen, the Figure S4 zeolite 13X showed a two-step decomposition
process (weight loss of 25.16%) in the temperature range 25–400
°C and that can be attributed to the desorption of both physi-
and chemisorbed water molecules. On the other hand, zeolite 13X with
20, 40, 60, and 80% amine impregnation showed multistep decomposition
with a weight loss % of 26.64, 26.57, 26.35, and 32.27, respectively,
in the same temperature range. Because zeolite 13X-PEI-60 showed maximum
adsorption of CO2, detailed analysis by TGA coupled to
mass spectroscopy (MS) was carried out to understand the decomposition
pattern of PEI from the evolved gas fragments at various stages and
the observed TGA–MS thermogram is shown in the Figure 3.

Figure 3 (a) TGA–DTG analysis
for 13X-PEI-60 and (b) MS analysis
for 13X-PEI-60.

As can be seen from the TGA–MS
thermogram (Figure 3) of zeolite 13X-PEI-60 that
it undergoes three step decomposition process at 25–100, 100–400
and 400–600 °C. Along with H2O (18 AMU), mass
fragments −NH2 (16 AMU), −CH2–NH–CH2– (43 AMU) and −CH2–CH2–NH2 (44 AMU) are also observed between
25 and 400 °C, which clearly indicated the decomposition of PEI.
During the third decomposition step, that is, 400–600 °C,
in addition to the above mass fragments, −N–(CH2)3– (56 AMU) is also observed, inferring
that the PEI molecule is adsorbed on to the zeolite 13X both physically
and chemically as decomposition of the PEI molecule is taking place
at low and high temperatures.

Table S1 presents the amine loading
of amine-impregnated zeolite 13X samples of different weight percentage
of amine used, determined through TGA. Amine loading of each impregnated
sorbent was calculated using TGA as the weight drop from 100 to 800
°C and then changing it into a dry mass base at 100 °C.21

3.1.3 Elemental Analysis
The results
of elemental analysis are tabulated in Table 2. It is observed that the amine loading has
been successful in the zeolite structure through the presence of nitrogen
content (1.43 to 2.18 wt %) and carbon content (2.73 to 3.98 wt %)
in the PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X.

3.2 CO2 Adsorption by PEI-Impregnated
Zeolite 13X
3.2.1 Effect of Adsorption
Temperature on CO2 Adsorption Capacity
Figure 4 shows CO2 adsorption capacities
of 20, 40, 60, and 80 wt % PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X using 99.99%
pure CO2 gas at different temperatures of 25, 50, 75, and
100 °C. The maximum CO2 adsorption from the experiment
was observed around 75 °C, which indicates that 75 °C could
be considered as the optimum adsorption temperature for CO2 adsorption for the current class of sorbents. It was found that
CO2 adsorption for all the amine-loaded sorbents increased
with increasing temperatures till 75 °C and later decreased by
reaching 100 °C. The nature of highly loaded sorbents at temperatures
up to 75 °C is related with the diffusion-controlled mechanism
as the pores get occupied with PEI, which limits the availability
of amine sites for CO2 adsorption. The high CO2 adsorption capacities for these highly loaded sorbents (40 and 60
wt %) can be attributed to reduced diffusion resistance with the increase
in temperatures,15 whereas at the higher
temperature (100 °C), the low CO2 adsorption capacity
can be attributed to the exothermic nature of the reaction. It was
seen that at a lower temperature of 25 °C, lower loaded amine
of 20 wt % PEI, and at higher temperature of 100 °C, higher loaded
amine of 80 wt % showed higher adsorption capacities of 1 and 0.36
mmol/g, respectively. Thus, it can be generalized that at low temperature,
sorbents with low PEI loading might be more advantageous, and at high
temperature, sorbents with high PEI loading might be more advantages
for CO2 capture. Table S1 shows
the CO2 adsorption capacity of varied amine-loaded zeolite
13X at 75 °C and 1 atm and Table S2 shows CO2 adsorption capacity for all different loadings
of PEI on zeolite 13X at different temperatures.

Figure 4 CO2 adsorption

on zeolite 13X at different temperatures.

3.2.2 Effect of PEI Loading on CO2 Adsorption
Capacity
Zeolite 13X support with varied PEI loading was
prepared to find out the effect of amine loading on CO2 adsorption capacity. It is observed that CO2 adsorption
capacities increases as the amine loadings increased from 20 to 60
wt % and sorbent with 60 wt % PEI obtained the highest CO2 uptake. However, for PEI loading beyond 60 wt %, there was a reduction
in the adsorption capacity because of maximum pore blocking in the
zeolite structure. The amine loading of 60 wt % showcased maximum
CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.22 mmol/g of the adsorbent
in pure CO2 gas at 75 °C and 1 atm pressure (Table 3).

3.2.3 Adsorption
Kinetics
The kinetics
of CO2 adsorption of the prepared sorbents should be fast
enough to capture CO2 in practical applications. Figure 5 represents CO2 adsorption capacity of zeolite 13X with varied PEI loadings
as a function of time in the presence of 99.99% pure CO2 gas at 75 °C and 1 atm pressure. As can be observed from Figure 10, CO2 adsorption capacity for all PEI-loaded sorbents increases gradually
with respect to time, with 60 and 80 wt % PEI-loaded sorbents, showing
fastest and slowest adsorption rates respectively. The adsorbent with
60 wt % PEI loading adsorbed 0.93 mmol/g at the end 60 min, whereas
80 wt % PEI loading adsorbed 0.67 mmol/g at the same time. The better
kinetics of 60 wt % PEI-loaded sorbent can be attributed to diminished
diffusion resistance during CO2 adsorption on the sorbent
as discussed earlier, whereas, for 80 wt %, the PEI-loaded sorbent
took longer time to reach adsorption capacity of nearly 1 mmol/g which
might be due to heavy blocking of the microchannels by PEI molecules
for the CO2 molecules to approach or diffuse to the surface
and react with the available amine groups.

PEI loading on zeolite 13X at 75 °C and 1 atm.

3.3 Kinetic Modeling
Theoretically, the
adsorption of CO2 on PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X can be
described with any of the three reaction models mentioned earlier. Figure 6 shows the CO2 uptake of PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X at 75 °C and with
60 wt % amine loading along with the curves generated by fitting the
three models. Kinetic parameters, as well as squared correlation coefficient
(R2) for regressions, were listed in Table 4. From the results,
it can be concluded that the Avrami’s fractional order kinetic
model shows the best fit which describes the adsorption behavior of
CO2 on PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X at all temperatures.
However, the DKM model also offers the best description of the given
system except at 100 °C, where the model unfit can be attributed
to a low rate of CO2 adsorption.

The
mass transfer constant k1 of the
LDF model increased with increasing temperature which indicates better
adsorption at higher temperatures of about 50 to 75 °C. The Avrami’s
exponent nA from curve fitting ranged
between 0.62 to 1.74 which on an average valued to 1.01. This indicates
homogeneous adsorption of solute which would occur for any region
for a given time interval, whereas in the case of the DKM model, kinetic
constant kDKM increases and interaction
parameter βDKM decreases with the temperature, respectively.

The temperature dependence of the kinetic constant kA is described by the Arrhenius equation.36 20  where A is the Arrhenius
pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation
energy, R is the universal ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The plot of ln(k) versus 1/T is shown in Figure 7 and the value of Ea is given in Table 6.

Figure 7 Arrhenius plots for the kinetic constants obtained by Avrami’s
fractional kinetic model for 13X-PEI-60.

From the Boyd model study, it was observed from Figure 8 that Bt versus t graph passed through
the origin, which indicates that the rate-controlling step is intraparticle
diffusion. However, it is found in many studies that film diffusion
plays a role as a limiting step during the initial stages of adsorption
and then followed by intraparticle diffusion when gas molecules reach
the surface of the adsorbent. In addition to this observation, this
model helps in determining the effective diffusion coefficient (Di) according to eq 15 and whose values are tabulated
in Table 5. The Di values would be used to find
the activation energy Ea (given in Table 6) by plotting ln Di versus 1/T as per the following equation.37 21

From Figure 9 of
the intraparticle diffusion model, it was found that the qt versus t1/2 curve passed through the origin which indicates intraparticle diffusion
is the rate-controlling step as mentioned earlier. It was observed
that R2 values were closer to 0.99 at
all temperatures except at 100 °C and intraparticle rate constant kint increased with increase in temperature up
to 75 °C. This can be attributed to enhanced pore diffusion in
sorbent particles with an increase in temperature, and it is likely
that a large number of CO2 molecules diffuse into the pore
earlier to its being adsorbed. While at 100 °C, the CO2 molecules would rather get agitated more in the gas film instead
of diffusing into the particle pores. Also, the intraparticle diffusion
coefficient is calculated according to eq 17 and the values are tabulated in Table 5.

intraparticle diffusion model for 13X-PEI-60
at 75 °C.

Figure 10 shows the CO2 desorption of PEI impregnated
zeolite 13X at 75 °C and with 60 wt % amine loading along with
the curves generated by fitting the two models mentioned earlier.
Kinetic parameters and the squared correlation coefficient (R2) are listed in Table S3. From the R2 values, it can be concluded
that the simple first-order kinetic model displays the best fit which
describes the desorption behavior of CO2 for the studied
adsorbent.

models
at 75 °C of 13X-PEI-60.

In summary, PEI-impregnated 13X zeolite’s CO2 adsorption
capacity increases with an increase in temperatures up
to 75 °C and thereafter decreases. CO2 adsorption
capacity with PEI loading increases as the loading increases up to
60 wt % and thereafter decreases because of heavy pore blocking in
the zeolite 13X framework. The adsorption kinetics was found to fast
at 75 °C temperature with 60 wt % PEI loaded sorbent. The mechanism
involved is predominantly chemisorption-based, where the primary and
secondary amines of PEI reacts with CO2 to form carbamates
as shown in eqs 22 and 23.38 22   23  

4 Conclusions
Zeolite
13X has been impregnated with PEI using the methanol solvent.
Texture and surface chemistry of the thus-prepared material has been
investigated through N2 adsorption–desorption studies,
SEM, XRD, TGA, FTIR, and CHNS analysis. The optimal adsorption temperature
of PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X sorbents was found to be 75 °C
with the highest CO2 adsorption and fast kinetics. The
optimal PEI loading was found at 60 wt % with a maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.22 mmol/g in pure atmospheric CO2. Through kinetic modeling, it can be demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption onto the PEI impregnated zeolite 13X surface could
be accurately described by Avrami’s fractional order accurately
and intra-diffusion step to be the rate-limiting step for this adsorption
process. Thus, it is found that the 60 wt % PEI-modified 13X zeolite
showed betterment in CO2 adsorption capacity over unmodified
zeolite 13X by a factor of 2.3 at 75 °C when compared with the
available literature on pristine zeolite 13X.19 The significance of the work lies in the fact that branched PEI
impregnated on zeolite could trigger higher adsorption capacity at
optimum reaction parameters as reiterated further from the kinetic
modelling study. The present study is believed to be a cost-effective
approach that can be extended to simulated flue gas conditions for
a broad scope of the CO2 capture study application. Further
studies on the impregnation of different molecular weights of PEI
amine on zeolite, along with the effect of the binder on palletization
in a simulated flue gas conditions would help in demonstrating these
adsorbents role better in mitigating climate change by capturing CO2 in a simple and economical approach.

4.1 Experimental:
CO2 Adsorption and
Desorption Studies
CO2 adsorption/desorption studies
were performed by using thermal gravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments
SDT Q600) which gives results in the form of CO2 uptake
(in mg) with respect to time under the maintained desired conditions.25,26 99.99% pure CO2 gas was used for CO2 adsorption
measurements. Pure N2 gas was used as a purge gas in the
pretreatment and desorption step. The sample was properly ground to
achieve the uniform particle size, and then, 15–20 mg of the
sample is loaded on an alumina pan. Before starting the adsorption
process, the samples were pretreated at 100 °C in the presence
of N2 gas flow at a flow rate of 50 mL/min, to ensure volatilization
of moisture and other volatiles present in the sample. After holding
the sample for 60 min, the instrument was allowed to cool down to
the desired temperatures which were 25, 50, 75, and 100 °C. As
the temperature was equilibrated to desired levels, the gas was switched
from pure N2 to pure CO2 at a flow rate of 50
mL/min. The CO2 adsorption process begins and isothermal
conditions were maintained for a period of 120 min. Then, the temperature
was increased from a set temperature to 105 °C and the gas was
switched back to N2 gas to desorb all the adsorbed CO2 from the sample. This desorption temperature was maintained
for 60 min. The amount of CO2 molecules adsorbed onto the
synthesized modified zeolite (mg/g) was calculated based on eq 24, where wt and w0 represents
the mass of adsorbent at time t and original mass
of the adsorbent, respectively. 24
