Three-dimensional carbon-based porous
materials have proven to
be quite useful for tailoring material properties in the energy conservation
and environmental protection applications. In view of the three-dimensional
and well-defined structure of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
a novel carbon-based magnetic porous material (HKUST–Fe3O4) has been designed and constructed by MOF–guest
interactions of high-temperature pyrolysis. The obtained HKUST–Fe3O4 exhibited the unique features of superparamagnetism,
a macro/mesoporous structure, environmental protection (inexistence
of toxic heavy metal ions), and physicochemical stability and has
shown high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption for carcinogenic
organic pollutants (for example, rhodamine B) with an environmentally
friendly character and excellent reusability. We demonstrate that
the unique/superior advantages of HKUST–Fe3O4 could meet the requirements of environment cleaning, especially
for removing the targeted organic pollutant from water. Moreover,
the specific HKUST–Fe3O4 and organic
pollutant interaction mechanism has been analyzed in detail via parameter-free
calculations. This study proposes a promising strategy for constructing
novel carbon-based magnetic nanomaterials for various applications,
not limitated to pollutant removal.

1 Introduction
Water
resources are more polluted by organic pollutants now and
many people have to face the problem of absolute water scarcity, especially
the long-term residents in developing countries.1−5 Therefore, water reuse is becoming extraordinarily
important and effective materials are needed to be produced and applied
to sustainable wastewater treatment and for efficient water use, particularly
for populations with limited resources and/or those living in remote
areas.6,7 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are
the emerging three-dimensional (3D) and well-defined materials.8−10 Due to their highly porous and flexible structure, MOFs have been
widely used as adsorbents to remove the organic pollutants in the
liquid-phase separations for environmental cleaning/water purification.11−15 Recently, tremendous efforts have been taken to improve the adsorption
capacity and separation efficiency of organic pollutants by MOFs via
different approaches.16,17 For example, as for the adsorption
capacity, many works have been focused on the adjustment of central
metal ions and organic ligands to improve the pore size and increase
the binding sites.18−20 However, no matter how magnificent the diversity
of MOFs is, it is impossible to avoid the existence of toxic metals
ion despite their relative stability in the frameworks of MOFs.21,22 Particularly, when the separation environment of pollutants is complex,
there are threats of toxic metal leakage due to the spontaneous disintegration
of MOFs.23 As for the MOF separation efficiency,
the low-cost standing would undoubtedly waste a lot of time and the
repeated centrifugation is not an energy-saving operation, both of
which are not effective strategies for large-scale applications.24,25 Because of the unique contactless feature, magnetic nanomaterials
have received extensive attention and shown promising applications
in separation, wastewater treatment, environment remediation, and
so on.26−28 Compared with the other types of magnetic nanomaterials,
Fe3O4-based magnetic nanomaterials were typical
magnetic nanomaterials that have been widely studied. For example,
the group of Xie has designed Fe3O4-based magnetic
nanomaterials with various functions for biocatalysis applications.29−33 As for MOFs, many scholars have taken various measures to modify
MOFs with an environmentally friendly magnetic property. However,
these approaches still rely on the functionalization or cladding of
MOFs that suffered from the complex procedure of modification and
a sharp decrease in the specific surface area.34 Besides, although the exploitation of magnetic metal ion-based
MOFs has not involved any complex procedure, these MOFs could not
debarb the disintegration and toxicity absolutely.35 Despite having achieved enormous progress on applications
of MOFs so far, it remains a great challenge to exploit MOF-based
absorbents with low/no toxicity (environmentally friendly character)
and magnetic property, especially with high adsorption capacity, superior
chemical stability, and excellent reusability.

Dye wastewater
is a typical organic pollutant with the complex
structure of an aromatic ring that could cause great damage to natural
environment and human health. Rhodamine B (RhB) is a well-known water-soluble
xanthene organic dye with carcinogenic properties that often wantonly
discharged into the environment in some developing countries.30 RhB could not be biodegraded directly, and the
artificial degradation of RhB often involves tedious procedures and
high-cost metal catalysts that are not affordable by these developing
countries.36 The adsorption method is recognized
as a superior method for the separation of RhB due to its many advantages
such as low cost, high efficiency, easy operation, and insensitivity
to the toxic substances.

Here, we present a facile approach
to transform a common MOF (i.e.,
HKUST) into a carbon-based magnetic porous material (namely, HKUST–Fe3O4) with an abundant macro/mesoporous structure
via a simple high-temperature treatment (pyrolysis followed by washing).
Since this strategy is developed based on guest impregnation of the
precursors of magnetic Fe3O4 (FeCl3 solution) rather than chemical functionalization or cladding of
magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, HKUST–Fe3O4 has shown high adsorption capacity and rapid
adsorption for RhB with an environmentally friendly character and
excellent reusability. In addition, the parameter-free calculations
have been utilized to reveal the adsorption mechanism.

2 Results and Discussion
A carbon-based magnetic honeycomb
sorbent, HKUST–Fe3O4, was obtained from
the high-temperature pyrolysis
of the precursors of Fe3O4 (FeCl3 solution) in the holes of HKUST. As shown in Scheme 1, HKUST was first synthesized under the self-assembly
of a central metal ion (Cu2+) and an organic ligand (trimesic
acid, TA) by a hydrothermal reaction. Then, FeCl3 solution
(containing an alkali agent and such others) was impregnated into
the holes of HKUST to form magnetic Fe3O4 by
high-temperature pyrolysis with keeping the major carbon structure.
After washing by FeCl3 and HCl solutions, the byproducts
Cu particles and CuCl were removed to obtain the environmentally friendly
HKUST–Fe3O4 (inexistence of toxic Cu2+ ions) for water cleaning.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Synthetic Procedure and Application
of HKUST–Fe3O4
Figure 1a exhibits
that HKUST–Fe3O4 is a magnetic entity
and possesses a quasi-superparamagnetic nature, whereas blue HKUST
does not respond to the magnetic field (Figure S1a), which indicated the formation of magnetic Fe3O4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of
HKUST–Fe3O4 in Figure 1b manifested that there was only one chemical
state of the Fe element (Fe 2p3/2 of 710.1 eV, Fe 2p1/2 of 723.2 eV) that was attributed to magnetic Fe3O4.37 In addition, Figure 1c demonstrates that
the byproducts metallic Cu and CuCl can be removed thoroughly by washing
with FeCl3, water, and HCl38 because there was no Cu peak in HKUST–Fe3O4 compared to HKUST–Fe3O4 before
wash. A detailed morphological characterization in Figure 2a demonstrated that HKUST showed
a hexagonal polyhedron with tight and smooth surface. After high-temperature
pyrolysis and repeated wash, HKUST–Fe3O4 exhibited a carbon-based porous structure with pores (typically
ca. 100 nm) at the outer surface (shown in Figure 2b,c). The marked areas in Figure 2c showed that the surface and
internal pores of HKUST–Fe3O4 were interconnected
structures, and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of internal
cross section in Figure 3d further demonstrated this three-dimensional interconnected feather
with a typical honeycomb structure and suggested that HKUST–Fe3O4 was a good candidate for adsorption. As shown
in Figure 3a, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of HKUST–Fe3O4 exhibited the type IV isotherm and a small hysteresis
loop. Under the relative pressure (p/p0) of 0.4–0.6, there was an obvious step, suggesting
the existence of abundant mesoporous in HKUST–Fe3O4. Moreover, Figure 3b shows that the average pore size of HKUST–Fe3O4 was calculated to be 15.8 nm with a wide mesoporous
and macroporous distribution, suggesting that HKUST–Fe3O4 was a good candidate for the adsorption of organic
pollutants and the porous structure could provide convenient assess
for the easy entrance of organic pollutants into HKUST–Fe3O4. In Figure 1d, HKUST–Fe3O4 mostly
consisted of C (atomic concentration 87.1%) with an abundant carbon-based
structure (C–C, atomic concentration 62.7%) and a small amount
of Fe3O4 (atomic concentration 0.53%) dispersed
in them (calculated from high-resolution XPS spectra of C, Fe, and
O39).

To explore the accessibility of the porosity of this porous
material,
carcinogenic organic cationic RhB adsorption and release were investigated.
HKUST and HKUST–Fe3O4 with different
doses (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg) were added in the RhB aqueous solution
(10 mg L–1). The adsorption behavior of HKUST–Fe3O4 toward RhB was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy.
The maximum excitation wavelength of RhB was set at 554 nm, and the
maximum emission peak was obtained at 574 nm, as shown in Figure 4a. After the equilibrium
adsorption in RhB aqueous solution (10 mL), HKUST–Fe3O4 (2 mg) could adsorb 85.6 μg of RhB, whereas the
total adsorption capacity (Q) of HKUST (10 mg) for
RhB was only 16.4 μg (shown in Figures 4a and S2). It
was found that the size of holes in HKUST is only about 8.9 Å,40 whereas the 3D size of RhB is calculated as
about 17 × 13 × 8 Å3 (shown in Figure S3a).41−43 It was obvious that
the adsorption of HKUST for RhB was only conducted on the external
surface because of the huge space hindrance. After carbonization,
the removal of small solvent (e.g., water, residual organic ligand)
and pyrolysis of functional groups endowed HKUST–Fe3O4 with abundant mesopores and macropores, which could
form a high specific surface area. N2 adsorption/desorption
measurements (shown in Figure 3a) showed that it is exceedingly convenient for RhB to enter
into the pores and be bound by the internal binding sites. The removal
rate (η) of HKUST–Fe3O4 (2 mg)
for RhB can reach 83% (shown in Figure 4c) with the adsorption capacity (Qe) of 42.8 mg g–1 (shown in Figure 4b). It should reach
a conclusion that the HKUST–Fe3O4 exhibited
a high adsorption capacity for RhB, and 2 mg dose of HKUST–Fe3O4 was the most economic dosage for the following
adsorption experiments.

To illustrate the separation efficiency of HKUST–Fe3O4, the dynamic adsorption of RhB on HKUST–Fe3O4 was investigated. As shown in Figure 4d, an increase adsorption of
HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB occurred in the first
2 min and then the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 60 min.
Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations were employed
to reveal the adsorption mechanism.44,45 As shown in Table 1, the pseudo-second-order
equation (R2 = 0.9437) gave a better fitting
than that of the pseudo-first-order equation (R2 = 0.8917), indicating that the limiting factor of HKUST–Fe3O4 for adsorbing RhB was the adsorption mechanism
rather than the particle mass transfer.44,45 Combined with
the results of N2 adsorption/desorption measurements (shown
in Figure 3a), pore
size distributions of HKUST–Fe3O4 (shown
in Figure 3b), and
3D size of RhB (shown in Figure S3a), there
was negligible transfer resistance in space because the average pore
size of HKUST–Fe3O4 was far larger than
the size of RhB. That is to say, the fast mass transfer of RhB in
HKUST–Fe3O4 was also attributed to the
strong interactions between RhB and HKUST–Fe3O4. The results of the intraparticle diffusion model in Table 1 showed that the linear
curve of Qt versus t1/2 has not passed through the origin, so intraplate diffusion
was the main control step but not the only one.46 The adsorption of HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB was also controlled by external diffusion (i.e., surface
adsorption and liquid film diffusion).46 In addition, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were employed
to analyze the adsorption mechanism of HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB of different concentrations.47 Compared with the correlation coefficients (R2) in Table 2, it was found that the Freundlich model gave a better fitting than
the Langmuir model, suggesting that the binding sites were heterogeneous
with multiple binding interactions. Looking back at the structural
formula of RhB in Figure S3b, there are
two strong polar binding sites (marked as red), namely, carboxyl and
quaternary ammonium groups that provide electrostatic interactions
(possible hydrogen bonds) with the charged sites of HKUST–Fe3O4. In addition, the backbone and side chains of
RhB (marked as blue) are hydrophobic that could form strong hydrophobic
interaction because there were strong hydrophobic regions in HKUST–Fe3O4. It should be noted that the week polar positions
of RhB (marked as pink) are intensely hard to form hydrogen bonds
due to the large space hindrance and disturbance in the aqueous phase.
From the ζ-potential of HKUST–Fe3O4 in solutions of different pH values (shown in Figure S4), it was found that HKUST–Fe3O4 possessed the positive charges in aqueous solution, which
could have favorable electrostatic interactions with carboxyl groups
(−COO–) of RhB. Combined with results of
isothermal adsorption, it was demonstrated that electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions were the main driving forces for HKUST–Fe3O4 to adsorb RhB. As shown in Table 2, the calculated 1/n of 0.55 was less than 1, indicating that the adsorption was achieved
with high efficiency. As shown in Figure 5a, the adsorption capacity of HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB was decreased with the increase of NaCl
(within the range of 0–20 mM), indicating that there were strong
electrostatic interactions between RhB and HKUST–Fe3O4, which was in accordance with the results of Freundlich
isothermal adsorption. Higher concentration of NaCl (≥20 mM)
could not induce further decrease of the adsorption capacity, once
again suggesting the existence of strong hydrophobic interactions
between HKUST–Fe3O4 and RhB.48 It should be noted that the separation efficiency
was also reflected in the separation method because of the convenient
separation of HKUST–Fe3O4 under the magnetic
field (shown in Figure S1b,c), which demonstrated
its great potential in the large-scale separation.

To prove the reusability of
HKUST–Fe3O4, the adsorbed HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB was
carbonized under high temperature and washed again for the re-adsorption
of RhB. As shown in Figure 5b, the adsorption performance of HKUST–Fe3O4 still could show a high adsorption capacity toward
RhB even after five cycles. It was reasonable because there were only
noncovalent interactions between HKUST–Fe3O4 and RhB. Under high temperature and a N2 atmosphere,
the adsorbed RhB was easily decomposed and then volatilized, leaving
the original structure of HKUST–Fe3O4. Therefore, the treated HKUST–Fe3O4 still could maintain its original adsorption performance, identifying
its potential application in practice. Figure 5c exhibits the UV–vis spectra of HKUST–Fe3O4 for the other typical organic pollutants, carcinogenic
and/or toxic MB, NIT, IDP, and PNP. In Figure 5d, it is found that HKUST–Fe3O4 showed extremely low adsorption capacities toward MB
(3.2 mg g–1), NIT (0.9 mg g–1),
IDP (1.2 mg g–1), and PNP (3.0 mg g–1) by the calculation based on the standard curves, which was far
below the adsorption capacity of HKUST–Fe3O4 for RhB (42.8 mg g–1). Through analyzing
their structures in Figure S5, the reason
for low adsorption capacities was obvious due to electrostatic repulsion
and weak binding sites. To some extent, HKUST–Fe3O4 had a certain degree of selectivity for RhB, although
further research has not been conducted by choosing the analogues
and carrying out the competition experiment. We thus might propose
boldly that the selectivity of carbon-based MOFs for targets could
be controlled by adjusting the organic ligand of parent MOFs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, adhering to the concepts of
nontoxicity (environmentally
friendly character), high adsorption performance, rapid separation,
and reusability simultaneously, we proposed a new strategy to prepare
the carbon-based magnetic porous materials via bottom-up fabrication
from MOF–guest polyhedra to capture the organic pollutant RhB.
This three-dimensional network structure made HKUST–Fe3O4 with superior separation efficiency for RhB
owing to the designable binding sites and specific porous structure.
The proposed strategy combining both the experimental and theoretical
efforts can provide a general guideline for different magnetic carbon-based
materials with controllable pores for the capture of a specific pollutant
that individualizes its great potential in possible industrial-scale
applications. In addition, this strategy for the construction of MOF-based
magnetic nanomaterials might be used in the other applications and
is the good research direction and will be reported in the future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
materials were purchased
and used as received without further purification: copper nitrate
trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Aladdin,
99%), trimesic acid (TA, C6H3(CO2H)3, Aladdin, 98%), iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, Aladdin, 99%), sodium acetate trihydrate
(C2H3O2Na·3H2O, Aladdin,
99%), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mn 4000,
Aladdin), rhodamine B (RhB, C28H31ClN2O3, Aladdin, 98%), methylene blue (MB, C16H18ClN3S, Aladdin), p-nitrophenol
(PNP, C6H5NO3, Aladdin, 99%), imidacloprid
(IDP, C9H10ClN5O2, Aladdin),
and nitenpyram (NIT, C11H15ClN4O2, Aladdin). Ethanol and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) used in the procedures were products of
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China.

4.2 Synthesis
of HKUST
HKUST (Cu3C18H6O12) was synthesized
based on the methods described by Peng et al.49 Typically, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (5
g) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (60 mL) and TA (1.36 g) was dissolved
in ethanol (60 mL) to form the homogeneous solution. After ultrasonication
for 10 min, the two solutions were mixed together followed by the
addition of DMF (4 mL). After shaking, the mixture was sealed in the
high-pressure reactor at 80 °C for 20 h. Thereafter, the high-pressure
reactor was cooled to room temperature through natural cooling. Finally,
the resulting blue product HKUST with the yield of about 88% was obtained
after gentle filtration, repeated washing with ethanol, and vacuum
drying at 100 °C for 2 h.

4.3 Preparation
of HKUST–Fe3O4
The thermal processing
of HKUST–Fe3O4 was conducted by the following
procedures. FeCl3·6H2O (2.5 g), sodium
acetate trihydrate (7.2
g) and PEG (2.0 g) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (80 mL) under
vigorous stirring. Then, HKUST (1 g) was immersed in the above solution
for 20 min at room temperature (25 °C, Yangling, China) with
gentle stirring. The resultant solids were collected by filtration
and then washed with ethanol until the liquid filtrate was almost
colorless. The solid was first dried under vacuum at 50 °C for
2 h and then placed in a tube furnace with the filling of N2 gently for 30 min. Thereafter, the solid was heated to 800 °C
with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and continuous
filling of N2. After kept at 800 °C for 2 h, the tube
furnace was cooled down naturally. The black HKUST–Fe3O4 was washed by FeCl3 (aq), HCl (aq), and
water to remove Cu particles and CuCl, respectively. Finally, HKUST–Fe3O4 was collected through the magnetic field and
dried under vacuum at 100 °C for further use.

4.4 Evaluation of Organic Pollutant Adsorption
Isotherms
Batch adsorption experiments of HKUST–Fe3O4 were conducted at room temperature (25 °C,
Yangling, China) using parallel triple tests. Typically, HKUST–Fe3O4 was added in the organic pollutant solution
(10 mg L–1). After a certain self-assembly adsorption
time, the solution was separated rapidly through the magnetic field
and recorded using the fluorescence spectra (FluoroMax-4, Horiba Scientific)
or UV–vis spectra (UV–vis 2550, Shimadzu). Here, RhB
was recorded by the fluorescence spectra (excitation wavelength at
554 nm, emission wavelength at 574 nm), and MB (290 nm), IDP (270
nm), NIT (215 nm), and PNP (318 nm) were recorded by UV–vis
spectra. For the recycling experiment, the absorbed HKUST–Fe3O4 was first dried under vacuum at 100 °C
for 1 h and then thermal processing was conducted in the same way
as before. Finally, the product was washed by ethanol and water, collected
through the magnetic field, and dried under vacuum at 100 °C
for the next cycle of adsorption.

4.5 Characterization
The crystallographic
information was obtained by X-ray diffraction (D8 Advance A25, Bruker)
equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. Chemical surface information
was determined by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Shimadzu);
before the test, the sample was crushed to reveal its interior. Specific
surface areas, pore volume, and pore size were determined using N2 physisorption isotherms at 77 K (ASAP2460, MICROMERITICS).
Magnetization measurements were conducted on a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM, LakeShore 7307).
