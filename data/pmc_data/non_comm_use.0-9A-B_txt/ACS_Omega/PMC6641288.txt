A new
series of conjugated donor−π–acceptor
type of 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine derivatives (compounds IK-(3–9)) have been synthesized via Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
(HWE) reaction, starting from a common phosphonate precursor and diverse
donor aromatic aldehydes and characterized by routine spectral analysis
including elemental analysis. Compound IK-2, one of the
starting precursors, and molecule IK-3, the first member
of the donor−π–acceptor series, are additionally
characterized by single-crystal X-ray structure determination. Compounds IK-2 and IK-3 are crystallized in P1̅ (triclinic) and P21/c (monoclinic) space groups, respectively. The absorption
maxima in the electronic spectra of the title compounds shift mainly
due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between different donor
(dibutyl and cyclic pyrrolidine) groups and the acceptor moiety [2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)
pyridine]. Solution-state emission spectral studies of all these compounds
show large solvent sensitive behavior with significant amounts of
Stokes shifts. The large solvent dependence of the emission indicates
that the excited state is stabilized in more polar solvents due to
the ICT. All chromophores exhibit solid-state fluorescence behavior
except compound IK-7. The role of the position and nature
of the donor functionalities in the conjugated backbone of overall
donor moiety of compounds IK-(3–9), on the electronic
absorption properties of the title chromophores has been demonstrated,
which has further been corroborated by density functional theory (DFT)
and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) computational studies. The emission
spectral results of compounds IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 have also been supported by the DFT and TDDFT
calculations. A fluorescence lifetime study on this series also shows
that the excited states are stabilized in more polar solvents. Finally,
one of the chromophores (chromophore IK-4) in the title
series has been shown to act as a selective molecular sensor (turn-off
switch) for the Cu(II) ion.

Introduction
Fluorescence1−4 has turned out to be an essential analytical technique in various
branches of science, most importantly, in the fields of analytical,
biological, and medicinal sciences. Among the various classes of emissive
organic π-systems, materials that absorb electromagnetic radiation
by virtue of an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and emit from
the corresponding photoexcited state are the most interesting ones
because of their prominent applications in the fields of molecular
electronics, integrated photonic devices, nonlinear optics, and so
forth.5−7 The well-designed electron donor and acceptor (DA)
or “push–pull” architecture can be fabricated
via the electronic association between the donor and acceptor mesomeric
units in a chromophore system, which, in turn, is linked with diverse
functionalities for spontaneous charge redistribution. Particularly,
π-conjugated chromophores with donor and acceptor moieties are
of considerable interest in terms of tuning their optical properties
wisely, over a wide range simply by varying the donor or acceptor
moieties. During the last three decades, the dynamics of ICT in the
excited states of various aromatic molecules of the type D–Ar–A
(where Ar is an aromatic system linking D and A through π conjugation)
have been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental investigations.8−13 The most fundamental types of interaction in such D–A systems
generally occur by virtue of ICT between the donor (D) and the acceptor
(A), thereby tuning the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap. The singlet state
undergoes preferable stabilization in more polar solvents via solvent
reorganization, which can be realized by large Stokes shifts of the
fluorescence emission.14−18 Numerous π-conjugated systems that can be described as functional
materials are particularly important to the development of organic
light-emitting diodes,19 electrogenerated
chemiluminescence,20 dye-sensitized solar
cells,21 and fluorescent sensors.22−25 Some years ago, we have established a series of 4,4′-π-conjugated-2,2′-bipyridine
chromophores and investigated their photophysical and thermal properties.26 We have also reported a series of asymmetrically
substituted and π-conjugated 2,2′-bipyridine derivatives
including their photophysics and computational studies.27 Last several years, in our laboratory, we have
been exploring diverse inorganic and organic systems that can be described
as functional materials.28−30 As a part of our recent research
on exploring functional materials, we have recently developed interests
in fluorescent chemosensors and reported our first success in selective
sensing of Fe3+ ion and IO4– ion by a metallocycle host.31 Fluorescent
sensing has received great attention because of its simple operation,
high selectivity, and sensitivity. The metal-selective fluorescent
chemosensors are widely exploited to detect biologically or environmentally
relevant metal ions. A Cu2+ ion is a biologically as well
as magnetically active metal ion, which is potentially important to
be detected by a fluorescent sensor.32−34 The strong fluorescence
quenching for most of the luminescent sensors for the Cu(II) ion is
due to the fast electron and energy transfer involving paramagnetic
copper center.35−39 In this work, we have chosen a π-conjugated tris-heterocyclic
ligand system, namely, 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine derivatives, because
such tris-heterocyclic ligands are important in recent years not only
because of their synthetic flexibility, strong metal binding tendency,
and spin crossover properties of their iron complexes but also because
of their potential to act as a fluorescent sensor for a metal ion
because of their strong luminescence behavior. 2,6-Bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine
derivatives have recently been exploited in diverse areas including
catalysis, solar cell photosensitization, magnetism, and so forth.40−45

We wish to report, in this article, the synthesis and characterization
of π-conjugated donor–acceptor molecules (compounds IK-(3–9), Chart 1) containing 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine core as a common acceptor
moiety and diverse donor moieties (second row, Chart 1). The chromophores, IK-(3–9) (Chart 1), were found
to display bright fluorescence in the solution, and compounds (IK-(3–6), IK-8, and IK-9)
exhibit solid-state fluorescence at room temperature. We have demonstrated
that one of the title chromophore (compound IK-4) acts
as a fluorescence probe for the selective sensing of the Cu2+ ion. We have also performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations
to corroborate the UV–visible and emission spectral results
of the title donor−π–acceptor chromophores.

Chart 1 Molecules Synthesized and Studied in the Present Work
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The
2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)-4-bromomethyl pyridine
precursor IK-1 (see Chart 1 for the structural representation of IK-1)46 and the required appropriate N,N-dialkylated-
and pyrrolidine-substituted aldehydes S1c–7c(26,27) (see Scheme S1, Supporting Information for syntheses and structural drawings of S1c–7c) along with their precursors
were synthesized according to the literature procedures in good yields
(see Schemes S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Compound IK-2 (phosphate derivative, see Chart 1) was synthesized
by Arbuzov reaction of compound IK-1 with triethyl phosphite.
The target molecules (compounds IK-(3–9)) have
been synthesized using an efficient Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
(HWE) reaction pathway (Chart 1). The advantages of the HWE reaction pathway over the conventional
Wittig reaction are of many folds: (i) the former one has a good response
with the stabilized yields, (ii) it mainly gives E-stereo selectivity
of the olefin bond, and (iii) it generates a water-soluble phosphate
which can easily be removed from the reaction mixture through the
aqueous process. The difficulty over the separation of Wittig by-product,
triphenylphosphine oxide is thus largely ruled out in the HWE reaction.

After purification by column chromatography was done, the molecular
structures of all chromophores IK-(3–9) were determined
by infrared (IR), NMR (1H and 13C), and mass
spectral studies including CHN analyses (for characterization data,
see Supporting Information, Figures S7–S34).

Crystal Structure Description and Discussion
Compound IK-2 crystallizes in the triclinic system with space group P1̅. The thermal ellipsoidal plot of the crystal structure
of compound IK-2 is displayed in Figure 1a. In the crystal structure, the concerned
molecule undergoes C–H···O (2.55 Å) intramolecular
hydrogen-bonding interactions, leading to a chainlike supramolecular
arrangement (Figure 1b). Compound IK-3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system
with space group P21/c. The X-ray analysis of a single crystal of compound IK-3 reveals that the concerned asymmetric unit consists of the full
molecule, and the thermal ellipsoidal plot of the same is presented
in Figure 2a. The crystal
data and structure refinement parameters of compounds IK-2 and IK-3 are given in Table 1. Interestingly, in the crystal structure
of compound IK-3, the molecules undergo C–H···N
(2.68 Å) intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, leading
to a supramolecular dimer structure (Figure 2b). In the case of compound IK-3, both intermolecular hydrogen-bonding and π–π
stacking interactions play a vital role in the supramolecular ordering,
which leads to the formation a pseudo-sheetlike structure, as shown
in Figure 2b. The bond
lengths and bond angles, observed in the crystal structures of compounds IK-2 and IK-3, are presented in the section of
the Supporting Information (Tables S3 and S4 for compound IK-2 and Tables S7 and S8 for compound IK-3). The sheetlike structure, formed from the multilayered
supramolecular aggregates via intramolecular π–π
stacking interactions (d = 4.474 Å) of the associated
pyridine rings (J-aggregation), justifies the bathochromic shift in
the absorption maxima in going from the solution to solid state (vide
infra).

Photophysical Studies
The absorption and emission spectra
of the title compounds were recorded in different solvents at room
temperature (298 ± 2 K). Figure 3a displays normalized UV–vis absorption and
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of compounds IK-(3–9) in a dichloromethane (DCM) solvent. The absorption spectra of all
of the title compounds exhibit a broad absorption band in the visible
region (λmax = 400–495 nm). These absorption
bands are assigned to the intraligand charge-transfer bands which
are originated due to charge delocalization from the donor dialkyl
(compounds IK-4, IK-6, and IK-8) or pyrrolidine (compounds IK-3, IK-5, IK-7, and IK-9) amino group to (2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine)
acceptor subunits through the π-transmitters in the “push–pull”
molecules. In all of the cases, the single band is well-resolved in
this region, which has been confirmed due to its sensitivity to solvent
polarity. Figure 3b
depicts the spectra recorded in four different solvents, viz., toluene,
DCM, acetonitrile (MeCN), and dimethylformamide (DMF), at room temperature,
and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 2. From the absorption spectra,
it is quite evident that the compounds with pyrrolidine donors (for
example, IK-5 and IK-9) exhibit a bathochromic
shift by ≈10 nm compared to the compounds with corresponding
dibutyl amino group-substituted donors (IK-4 and IK-8). The cyclic pyrrolidine ring-substituted donor has a
more donating capability compared to the open-chain dibutyl amino
donor (consistent with NMR spectroscopy; see relevant section of the Supporting Information; Figure S35). PL has been
observed for all of the title chromophores IK-(3–9) at room temperature (298 ± 2 K). All solutions have been excited
at their respective lowest energy absorption maxima, and in all cases,
they exhibit excellent fluorescence behavior in various solvents (Figure 3a,b). The obtained
photophysical data in various solvents and fluorescence lifetime studies
suggest that the excited states of all of the title compounds IK-(3–9) are more polar than their respective ground
states. On varying the solvent polarity from lower (toluene solvent)
to higher (DMF solvent), the shifts in emission bands were found to
be more profound than those in the corresponding absorption bands.
Generally, the dipole character is increased in the excited state
S1, when the electrons are excited from the HOMO to the
LUMO. As a result, the solvents with high polarity tend to stabilize
such a polarized excited state by reorienting the solvent molecules
so as to lower the energy of the system, thereby leading to a red
shift in the emission spectra. This is well-explained from DFT calculations
and their molecular orbital (MO) diagrams (vide infra) and fluorescence
lifetime studies (see Figure 3c). The entire series of compounds IK-(3–9) exhibits strong emission in the solution (see Figures S36–S38, Supporting Information) as well as in the solid
state (except compound IK-7) at room temperature, as
shown in Figure S39 Supporting Information. Thus, the emission spectra of compounds IK-(3–9) are strongly dependent on the polarity of the solvent [see Tables 2 and S9 (Supporting Information)]. The emission of the
compound IK-3 varies from green to red with increasing
polarity of the solvent, for example, in the solution of moderate
polar solvent, such as toluene, it shows blue emission and the emission
maximum is centered at 460 nm, as shown in Figure 3b. On the other hand, in the solution of
more polar solvent, such as DMF, this shows green emission and the
pertinent emission maximum centers at 562 nm, as shown in Figure 3b. Hence, the solvent
dependence of the emission shows that the excited state is stabilized
in more polar solvents, which is due to an ICT. It has also been observed
that on increasing the conjugation length in this series of compounds,
the absorption and emission maxima are bathochromically shifted, as
shown in Figure 3a.
For example, when we compared the absorption and emission of compounds IK-3 versus IK-7 or IK-4 versus IK-6 in DCM, it has been observed that the λabs and λem values increase with increasing the conjugation
length (Table 2). Comparison
between the chromophores, based on the nature and position of the
donor functionalities, gives us some insight into the photophysical
properties. In cyclic donor systems (for example, compounds IK-5 and IK-9) the absorption and emission bands
in the chromophores are red shifted with good quantum yields compared
to their corresponding acyclic donor systems (compounds IK-4 and IK-8).

a ε was measured
in toluene,
DCM, MeCN, and DMF solution, but the case where no data are reported
is due to low solubility.

b Fluorescence relative quantum yield
of compounds IK-(3–9) was measured by using fluorescein
(in 0.1 N NaOH in EtOH) as the reference (Φem = 0.79).

c Stokes shift Δν̅

The fluorescence lifetime
of the entire series of compounds IK-(3–9) (see Figure 3c) was measured through
the time-correlated single
photon counting technique by monitoring their respective emission
maximum using a picosecond laser diode of 375 nm as an excitation
source. Fluorescence decay traces of all title compounds are best
fitted using a biexponential decay function I(t) = a1 × exp(−t/τ1) + a2 ×
exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetime components and a1 and a2 are their
respective amplitudes. Among all these derivatives, compound IK-3 in MeCN shows a shorter lifetime with the shortest component
(<65 ps, IRF) having a minor amplitude and a major component of
0.47 ns, whereas chromophores IK-8 and IK-9 show longest lifetime (1.83 ns), as shown in Table 3.

a The rate constants were estimated
using the following equations: kr = ϕf/τf and knr =
(1 – ϕf)/τf, where ϕf is the measured quantum yield and τf is
the fluorescence lifetime.

The fastest component can be attributed to the emission originating
from the ICT state, and the longest component can be due to the solvent-stabilized
ICT state. With the increase in the π-electron conjugation length
and electron-donating ability of the donor counterpart (from IK-3 to IK-9), we could see a progressive increase
in the fluorescence lifetime. On the other hand, the same π-conjugation
length but different donating ability for compounds IK-6 and IK-7 or IK-8 and IK-9 do not exhibit any difference in the lifetime. This indicates that
the extent of excited-state stabilization for these derivatives is
very similar. To understand the effect of solvatochromism and the
origin of these decay components, we have recorded the decay traces
of compound IK-3 in different solvents, DCM, MeCN, and
DMF, as shown in Figure S40 Supporting Information. In the highly nonpolar solvent, such as DCM, we could not be able
to fit the decay trace; hence, it is expected to be a lifetime on
the order of <65 ps. However, with an increase in the medium polarity
from MeCN to DMF, we have observed an increase in the fluorescence
lifetime from 0.49 to 0.63 ns along with the decrease in the nonradiative rate constant for compound IK-3, indicating a stabilization of the excited state in the
more polar medium.

Computational Analysis
Energy minimizations
of the
newly synthesized π-conjugated chromophores IK-(3–9) are performed in their ground electronic states in the gas phase
and also in solvent media (toluene, DCM, MeCN, and DMF). The energy
minimized structures of all the title compounds in the DCM solvent
are shown in Chart 2.

a Theoretical calculations
are
performed with the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the theory in the
DCM solvent medium.



The optimized structures
of the title compounds are treated as
the reference points for the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations.
The vertical excitation energy (λmax value for absorption)
is calculated in the gas phase and in the solvent medium; the relevant
data are given in the Supporting Information (Table S9). A uniform increment of λmax value is
observed along the series from compounds IK-3 to IK-9 in the gas-phase calculation. This is attributed due
to the larger conjugation length between a pair of compounds (IK-3, IK-7) and (IK-4, IK-6). The bathochromic shift between these pairs of compounds is larger
in the case of cyclic pyrrolidine substitution (∼47 nm) than
the open-chain dibutyl amino substitution (∼15 nm). This indicates
that the electron-donating capability of the cyclic pyrrolidine rings
is greater than that of the open-chain dibutyl amino donor. The same
statement is also applicable during the comparison between compounds IK-8 and IK-9, where both the compounds have
same vertical chain length and similar substitution (−OMe and
−OBu). A shift of the λmax values for the
compounds is observed in the presence of solvents (toluene, DCM, MeCN,
and DMF). This is attributed due to the change of energy gap between
the HOMO and the LUMO of the compounds in different solvent environments.
The energy values of HOMO, LUMO, LUMO–HOMO energy gap, ΔHOMO(GAS–DCM),
and ΔLUMO(GAS–DCM) of the compounds, both in the gas
phase (GAS) and in the solvent medium (in DCM), are given in Table 4. It is found from
the calculations that the LUMO–HOMO energy gap for the title
compounds is reduced in the solvent medium compared to that in the
gas phase. Both the HOMO and LUMO of the compounds are stabilized
in the solvent medium, and the stabilization of LUMO [ΔLUMO(GAS–DCM)]
in the solvent medium is greater than that of HOMO [ΔHOMO(GAS–DCM)].
As a result, excitation from HOMO to LUMO in each compound becomes
easier in the solvent medium. Thus, a bathochromic shift of the absorption
spectra is observed from all the compounds in the solvent medium (toluene,
DCM, MeCN, and DMF).

The MO diagrams of the HOMO and the LUMO of the energy-minimized
structure of the compounds are shown in Figure 4. It is found that the nature of the HOMO
of each compound belongs to a π-bonding type, whereas the same
for the LUMO is the π-antibonding type. The maximum charge density
(electron density) of the HOMO is situated at the donor moieties (pyrrolidine
or dibutyl amino), and in the case of LUMO, the maximum charge density
is situated at the 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine acceptor moiety. Therefore,
the overall π → π* type of electronic transitions
in the synthesized compounds occurs from pyrrolidine or dibutyl amino
donor moiety to the 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine acceptor moiety (charge
transfer in the same compound). As a result, this π →
π* electronic transition can be called ICT.

structure of the synthesized
compounds IK-(3–9).

Results, given in Table S9 (Supporting Information), indicate that the calculated λmax values using
the linear response (LR) model are comparable with the experimental
absorption values. An improved set of data of the calculated λmax values are obtained by using the state-specific (SS) model
of solvation. The normalized theoretical UV–vis absorption
spectra (indicated by solid lines) of the compounds are shown in Figure 5. The solvatochromic
shift of the absorption maxima (λmax) of the compounds
was not found prominent, when the absorption was taken place in different
solvents: toluene, DCM, MeCN, and DMF by both LR and SS model approaches.
For example, the calculated λmax values of compound IK-3 are 368, 376, 376, and 380 nm in toluene, DCM, MeCN,
and DMF (SS model), respectively. This shows a slight change of absorption
maxima for compound IK-3 with the increasing polarity
of the solvents. The same results are found for other compounds also,
when the calculations are performed in different solvents with increasing
polarity. This indicates that the polarity of the solvents has less
effect on the absorption spectra of the synthesized compounds.

(dashed line) of compounds IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 in the DCM solvent.

The overall bathochromic shifts of experimental absorption
peaks
in compounds IK-3, IK-5, IK-7, and IK-9, with different conjugation lengths and different
substitutions, are well-explained by the TDDFT calculation in different
solvent media (toluene, DCM, MeCN, and DMF). The same scenario was
observed in the case of compounds IK-4, IK-6, and IK-8. Another observation of the bathochromic
shift of absorption peaks is found among the title compounds with
the same substitution but different donor moieties (pyrrolidine vs
dibutyl amino, see Chart 1) in the solvent medium. An average bathochromic shift of
∼16/18 nm and ∼18/28 nm (via LR/SS model) is observed
for the pair of compounds (IK-4, IK-5) and
(IK-8, IK-9), respectively. The results
are justified by the LUMO–HOMO energy gap of the compounds
(see Table 4). For
example, compound IK-9 has less LUMO–HOMO energy
gap (∼4.97 eV) than compound IK-8 (∼5.21
eV). This indicates that the electronic transition from the HOMO (π)
to the LUMO (π*) is easier in compound IK-9 compared
to that in compound IK-8. This observation also concludes
that the electron-donating capability of the pyrrolidine donor is
greater than that of the dibutyl amino moiety.

The computed
fluorescence spectra of compounds IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 in the DCM medium are
shown in Figure 5,
indicated by the dashed lines. As mentioned in the methodology section,
the band structure of the fluorescence spectra is generated by convoluting
the stick vibronic lines obtained, from theoretical calculations with
the Lorentzian type of function using 0.29 eV full width at half-maxima
(fwhm). The intensity of the spectra is normalized to match with the
experimental observation. This practice ensures a good comparison
between the theoretical and experimental fluorescence spectra. It
is noted that theoretically, we calculated only the fluorescence spectra
for compounds IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 in the DCM medium. It is well-known that the evaluation of theoretical
fluorescence spectra is computationally very costly, and its cost
increased with the size of the molecule. Another difficulty of this
calculation is to find out the proper Franck–Condon geometry
at the excited state (S1). For the other compounds, we
found this difficulty during calculations. We can able to perform
the fluorescence spectral calculation only for compounds IK-3, IK-4, IK-5, and IK-7 in
the DCM solvent within the limit of our computational facility. In
the case of compound IK-4, we found discrepancies in
the Franck-Condon geometry in the excited state. Thus, we get only
its λmax value, not its band structure. Theoretically
obtained values for λmax in the DCM medium of compounds IK-3, IK-4, IK-5, and IK-7 are 433, 460, 464, and 553 nm, respectively. It is found from Figure 5 that bathochromic
shifts of the emission maxima (energy gap between λmax) between the pairs of compounds (IK-3, IK-5) and (IK-5, IK-7) are 31 and 89 nm, respectively.
The corresponding values for experimental findings are 51 and 63 nm,
respectively. This indicates that theoretical data underestimate the
change of bathochromic shift in the first pair (IK-3, IK-5) of compounds and overestimate the change of bathochromic
shift in the latter pair (IK-5, IK-7) of
compounds. However, the same comparison between the pair of compounds IK-3 and IK-7 indicates that the theoretical
data (120 nm) nicely reproduce the experimental observation (114 nm).
Therefore, it can be concluded from the above discussion that the
change of emission property with the length of the conjugation chain
is well-reproduced by theoretical calculations. The overall bathochromic
shift of emission maxima from compounds IK-3 to IK-7 is properly explained by this TDDFT-based calculation.
It is also noted that the bathochromic shift of emission maxima is
more prominent than the same for the absorption maxima when going
from compounds IK-3 to IK-9.

Solid-State
Emission of the Compounds
Except chromophore IK-7, all other chromophores, IK-(3–6), IK-8, and IK-9, showed a solid-state
emission, in addition to the emission in the solution (see Supporting Information, Figure S39). These compounds
absorb in the range 400–500 nm, and it is observed that there
is a bathochromic shift in the absorption maxima in going from the
solution state to the solid state, which signifies the presence of
intermolecular interactions between the molecules (might be due to
J-aggregation) in the solid state. When these chromophores IK-(3–6), IK-8, and IK-9 are excited in their respective
absorption maxima (422, 412, 438, 470, 445, and 453 nm, respectively),
they exhibit emission maxima at 583, 575, 569, 665, 663, and 634 nm,
respectively. The spectra of the solution and solid state (except
compound IK-7) emission of the title compounds are shown
in Figures S36–S39 (Supporting Information).

Highly Selective Turn-Off Phenomenon of a 2,6-Bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine-Based
Fluorescent Sensor for Recognition of Cu2+
From
the series of synthesized chromophores IK-(3–9), we selected IK-4 as a testing probe for the sensing
studies. Chromophore IK–4 was chosen for titration
experiments because of excellent solubility in the methanol (polar
protic) solvent compared to other chromophores, described in this
work. Except IK-4, all other chromophores are moderately
soluble in the methanol solvent. The titration experiments for the
synthesized compound IK-4 were studied with several metal
acetates (Na+, K+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Cs+, and U3+), commonly found in chemical media. The concentration
was maintained as identical for all metal ions in the methanol solvent,
which was titrated at an excitation wavelength of 408 nm. The emission
data were recorded for 2 min after a metal acetate solution was added.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 6a, drastic quenching in the emission of fluorophore IK-4 demonstrated that Cu2+ alone shows a distinct
mark in its fluorescence spectrum (almost labeled with X-axis, tiny emission intensity!), which can be observed even by the
naked eye. The chelation-enhanced fluorescence quenching (CHEQ) effect
may be the reason for this particular quenching response to Cu2+ ions. The paramagnetic (hypothetical) copper(II) coordination
complex (a d9 system) with molecule IK-4 (as
a ligand) seems to be responsible for this quenching.47 Apart from that, some of other metal ions M2+ (Ni, Co, Hg, and Zn) and Na+ acetate solution also quench
the emission to a small extent compared to Cu2+, as shown
in Figure 6a. Interestingly,
when we added cadmium acetate solution to the solution of fluorophore IK-4, we found that there was a red shift of about 45 nm (i.e.,
559–604 nm), which may be due to the formation of the dimer
structure with the cadmium coordination complex.

the addition of different cations (Mn+) in their acetate salts in methanol (λex = 408
nm). (b) Emission spectra of IK-4 (10 μM) in MeOH

Cu2+ ions per time; λex = 408 nm). Job’s

plot for chromophore IK-4 with Cu2+ (as its
acetate salt).

The UV–vis and
fluorescence titration experiments of compound IK-4 with
Cu2+ (as its acetate salt) are shown
in Figure S41a,b (Supporting Information) with the addition of increasing amount of Cu2+ (as its
acetate salt) to a MeOH solution of compound IK-4. As
shown in Figure S41a, the absorbance maximum
at ∼405 nm decreases gradually and at the same time, a new
absorbance maximum increases at ∼480 nm. A relevant isosbestic
point is observed at ∼450 nm, clearly indicating the formation
of complex between compound IK-4 and Cu2+ (from
its acetate salt). Moreover, the effects of anionic counter ions on
the sensing behavior of compound IK-4 to Cu2+ were also examined. The addition of different contaminants of different
copper salts, such as CuSO4, CuCl2, Cu(AcO)2, Cu(ClO4)2, and Cu(NO3)2 to the MeOH solution of compound IK-4, presents
the fluorescence profiles, shown in Figure 6b. As shown in Figure 6b, a negligible effect of different anions
on the detection capability of compound IK-4 is realized.
As shown from the fluorescence profiles of IK-4 with
different counter anions (Figure 6b), the fluorescence quenching is more for Cu(AcO)2 compared to other copper salts. Competitive binding experiment
results also indicate that the binding of the Cu2+ ion
to IK-4 is much stronger than that of other metal ions
(as their acetate salts), as shown in Figure S41c (Supporting Information).

The fluorescence titrations
of compound IK-4 were
performed by varying the concentrations of Cu2+ ions. The
fluorescence intensity of compound IK-4 progressively
decreased as Cu2+ (as its acetate salt) was progressively
increased. When the amount of Cu2+ added was about 220
μM, the fluorescence intensity almost reached minimum, as shown
in Figure 6c. The relevant
Stern–Volmer constant, calculated from the equation I0/I = 1 + Ksv[Q], is found to be Ksv =
21.2 M–1 from the plot, as shown in Figure 6d. To determine the binding
stoichiometry of the IK-4–Cu2+ complex,
the Job plot48 for the system was performed
in the methanol solution by maintaining the total concentration of
chromophore IK-4 and Cu2+ at 10 μM and
changing the molar ratio of Cu2+ ([Cu2+]/[Cu2+ + IK-4]) from 0 to 1, as shown in Figure 6c (inset). The result
shows a maximum at a molar fraction of 0.5, indicating the formation
of 1:1 complex of IK-4 and Cu2+. The electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS, Figure S42, Supporting Information) of a mixture of compound IK-4 and Cu(OAc)2 shows the formation of 1:1 coordination
complex. On the basis of the above studies, an expected binding model
for compound IK-4 with Cu2+ is shown in Figure
S42 (inset) (Supporting Information).

Summary
We have described the synthesis and characterization
of new conjugated
family of 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine derivatives with phenyl substituted
donor−π–acceptor molecules (Chart 1). Precursor compound IK-2 and
the first member of the series (compound IK-3) are additionally
characterized by the single-crystal X-ray structure determination.
The title compounds IK-(3–9) represent a unique
family in the sense that this series contains a common 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridine
unit acting as an acceptor moiety, common to each member of the family
and diverse donor functionalities. Chromophores IK-(3–9) are characterized by an ICT from the donors to the acceptor moiety.
We have demonstrated that the described compounds show large solvent
sensitive emissive behavior and their photophysical properties are
highly dependent on the number, nature, and position of the donor
functionalities, which have also been corroborated computationally
by TDDFT calculations. We have demonstrated that fluorescence spectra
of chromophores IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 can be explained by density functional calculations. At the last,
we have shown that molecule IK-4 can be described as
a selective molecular sensor for the recognition of Cu2+ ion; we have demonstrated this by fluorescence experiments of compound IK-4 with a series of metal ions (as acetates). Among all
metal acetates, we took, only copper acetate quenches the fluorescence
extensively. We have also performed fluorescence lifetime studies,
which indicate that the stabilization of the excited state is more
in the polar medium.

X-ray Crystallography
Single crystals, suitable for
facile structural determination for compounds IK-2 and IK-3, were measured on a Bruker D8 QUEST PHOTON 100 CMOS system
under Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) graphite monochromatic
X-ray beam. Data processing was accomplished by using SAINT-Plus,
and structures were solved by using SHELXS-97 and refined using SHELXL-14/7
program.49 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically by full-matrix least-square cycles on F2. Hydrogen atoms were introduced on calculated positions
and included in the refinement riding on their respective parent atoms.
Detailed information about crystal data and structure for compounds IK-2 and IK-3 is summarized in Table 1. CCDC 1564452 and CCDC 1564457
contain the supplementary crystallographic data of compounds IK-2 and IK-3, respectively. Relevant crystal
data can be obtained free of charge via http://www.ccdc.cam.atc.uk/conts/retrieving.html or from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, 12 Union Road,

Computational Methods
Energy minimization calculations
of the ground electronic state (So) of different chromophores IK-(3–9) were performed with DFT employing CAM-B3LYP
hybrid functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set of Pople, using Gaussian
09 program modules.50 The energy minima
of the compounds were confirmed by the subsequent frequency analysis
with the same level of theory. The solvent effect of the title chromophores
(compounds IK-(3–9)) has been accounted by placing
the compounds in the solvent cavity by following the self-consistent
reaction field approach as implemented in Gaussian 09 program modules.50 The polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach
was implemented to create the solvent cavity.51 The selected solvents are toluene, DCM, MeCN, and DMF. The vertical
excitation energy of the excited states of the chromophores was calculated
with the TDDFT using same functional and basis set by Gaussian 09
program modules.51 The vertical So → S1 transition energies were computed taking
the ground energy minimized structure as a reference. The geometry
of the S1 state of the compounds was calculated by analytic
TDDFT gradients implemented in Gaussian 09 suite program.52,53 The frequency analysis of the S1 state of the compounds
was subsequently determined by numerical variation of the TDDFT gradients.
This allows us to confirm the absence of imaginary frequencies and
to compute the different thermodynamic data.

The vertical excitation
energies from So → S1 transition for
each compound were computed considering the solvent reaction field
in both by the LR54 and SS model.55 The polarization of the solvent cavity in the
presence of solute (compounds IK-(3–9)) is considered
in the SS model. Therefore, the accuracy of the SS model is greater
than that of the LR approach at the price of significant increase
of the computational cost. The properties of the excited states (mainly
fluorescence transition) were calculated within the limits of both
equilibrium (eq) and nonequilibrium (neq) schemes of solvation under
modified PCM. In the eq scheme, the solvent molecules reorient themselves
according to the polarization of the electronic distribution of the
solute. However, in the neq scheme, solvent molecules find no time
to reorient themselves according to the electronic distribution of
the excited states of solute. Thus, the eq scheme needs higher computational
cost than the neq scheme. Geometry optimization in the ground and
excited states follows the eq scheme, whereas the vertical transitions
(absorption or emission) follow the neq scheme. Overall, the emission
spectrum is calculated following the principle discussed in refs56−58 and references therein. The emission spectra of the compounds IK-3, IK-5, and IK-7 were calculated
by visualizing the following representation (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 The calculation of the fluorescence
band structure of the compounds
was obtained by convoluting the stick lines (vide infra) with the
following Lorentzian line shape function with Γ fwhm to reproduce
the experimental resolution.
