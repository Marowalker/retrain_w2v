Surgical resection is recognized
as a mainstay in the therapy of malignant brain tumors. In clinical
practice, however, surgeons face great challenges in identifying the
tumor boundaries due to the infiltrating and heterogeneous nature
of neoplastic tissues. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is extensively used for defining the brain tumor in clinic.
Disappointingly, the commercially available (MR) contrast agents show
the transient circulation lifetime and poor blood–brain barrier
(BBB) permeability, which seriously hamper their abilities in tumor
visualization. In this work, red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots
(CPDs) were systematically investigated with respect to their BBB-penetration
ability. In summary, CPDs possess long excitation/emission wavelengths,
low toxicity, high photostability, and excellent biocompatibility.
CPDs exhibit high internalization in glioma cells in time- and dose-dependent
procedures, and internalized CPDs locate mainly in endolysosomal structures.
In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the BBB permeability of CPDs,
contributing to the early stage diagnosis of brain disorders and the
noninvasive visualization of the brain tumor without compromised BBB.
Furthermore, owing to the high tumor to normal tissue ratio of CPDs
under ex vivo conditions, our nanoprobe holds the promise to guide
brain-tumor resection by real-time fluorescence imaging during surgery.

1 Introduction
Despite the important advances
in the diagnosis and treatment of neoplasms, malignant brain tumors
still cause the extremely high morbidity and mortality.1 Currently, surgical resection is recognized as
a mainstay in the therapy of malignant brain tumors.2 However, it is very difficult for surgeons to intraoperatively
distinguish the tumor boundaries due to the infiltrating and heterogeneous
nature of neoplastic tissues, frequently leading to incomplete surgical
resections.3 The residual neoplastic foci
has been associated with the local recurrence and poor prognosis.4 Conversely, aggressive excision may damage the
adjacent crucial areas that control language or movement.5 Therefore, intraoperative delineation of brain-tumor
boundaries is vital for improving the surgical prognosis.

Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful neuroimaging technique for preoperative
detection and localization of brain tumor.6 Gadolinium (Gd) chelates as MR contrast agents (CAs) are widely
used to delineate tumor margins in clinic.7 These CAs could lead to MR signal enhancement in tumor areas, where
the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted. Unfortunately,
early brain disorders and many malignant brain tumors cannot be enhanced
because of the uncompromised BBB.8,9 Moreover, the
tumor boundaries delineated by preoperative MRI are always not completely
aligned to the actual margins due to brain shifts during surgery.10 Even though this problem can be overcome through
intraoperative MRI, it usually requires repeated administration of
Gd chelates due to their transient circulation lifetime, which may
result in inaccuracies caused by false-positive contrast enhancement.11 Furthermore, the high running costs and time-consuming
procedures of intraoperative MRI also limit its applications during
surgery.12 Therefore, the ideal probes
for brain tumor imaging would have the optimized circulation lifetime
and the capability to cross intact BBB.

Recently, optical fluorescent
imaging technique has been widely used to improve intraoperative tumor
visualization.13,14 The fluorescent dyes, such as
5-aminolevulinic acid and fluorescein, can be used as imaging agents
to label malignant brain tumors successfully.13 However, these agents included some limitations, such as false-positive
labeling and lack of tumor specificity.14 Moreover, they require a broken-down BBB to leak into the areas
of brain tumors to achieve the tumor labeling.15 To our knowledge, nanoprobes demonstrate great potential
in tumor imaging due to their tunable circulation lifetime, imaging
sensitivity and targeting specificity, and enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect that increase the intratumoral delivery.16 Even though previous studies exhibit the ability
of nanoprobes to visualize extracranial tumor xenografts in vivo,17,18 the application of nanoprobes in brain tumor imaging is barely satisfactory
because the BBB prevents almost all exogenous macromolecules from
entering the brain.19 Therefore, the BBB
is regarded as a big challenge for the intracerebral delivery of nanoprobes,
which seriously hinders the diagnosis and therapy of brain diseases.
Quantum dots are attractive nanoparticles (NPs) and possess excellent
optical properties. Though they can provide real-time imaging during
the brain tumor resection, they are limited to their potential toxicities.15 Recently, photoluminescent carbon dots (CDs)
have attracted increasing interest because of their superior optical
properties, low toxicity, high photostability, excellent biocompatibility,
and easy modifications.20,21 Moreover, compared to
traditional organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots, CDs are regarded
as promising fluorescent probes in biomedical applications, such as
bioimaging and biosensing.22−24 Therefore, it is of high importance to develop carbon-based nanoparticles
that can cross the BBB and realize the brain tumor imaging.

In our recent studies, o-phenylenediamine (oPD) and HNO3 have been used to synthesize red
emissive carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), which show the optimal emission
at around 630 nm and extremely high quantum yield (QY) around 10.83%
(in water) and 31.54% (in ethanol).25 The
red emissive CPDs could be used for in vivo imaging due to the strong
tissue penetration capability of their fluorescence. To our knowledge,
the transport of CPDs across the BBB has not previously been researched
systematically. Herein, our goal is to comprehensively evaluate the
BBB permeability of CPDs and their potential application for brain
tumor imaging. First, we study the cellular behaviors of CPDs in C6
brain glioma cells. Subsequently, we evaluate the BBB-penetration
capability of CPDs in vitro and in vivo. Finally, C6 glioma-bearing
rats are used to investigate the targeting effect of CPDs. In summary,
in vitro and in vivo studies confirm the BBB permeability of CPDs,
contributing to the early stage diagnosis of brain disorders and the
noninvasive visualization of the brain tumor without compromised BBB.
In addition, CPDs could successfully distribute into the orthotopic
brain glioma with high tumor to normal tissue ratio, demonstrating
the feasibility to guide brain-tumor resection by real-time fluorescence
imaging during surgery.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of CPDs
We previously reported
the preparation of excitation-independent red emissive CPDs through
one-step hydrothermal method using o-phenylenediamine
(oPD) and HNO3, and they exhibited narrow
bandwidth emission and extremely high QY around 10.83% (in water)
and 31.54% (in ethanol). Furthermore, they exhibited an excitation-independent
photoluminescence with the optimal emission at around 630 nm and a
shoulder peak at 677 nm. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of
CPDs showed several absorption bands at 282 and 535–621 nm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of CPDs indicated that
CPDs were nearly spherical with uniform size (ca. 5.74 nm). The ζ-potential
of CPDs was ca. +1.5 mV. We have described the detailed characterization
of CPDs in our previous work.25

2.2 Cytotoxicity of CPDs in Glioma
Cells
Low cytotoxicity is a prerequisite for CPDs to be applied
in the biological field. To investigate the cytotoxicity of CPDs,
an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was conducted on the C6 glioma cells. After 24 h incubation
with a series of concentrations of CPDs (50–400 μg mL–1), the cell viability of C6 remained above 80% at
concentrations as high as 400 μg mL–1 (Figure 1). Thus, it was concluded
that CPDs displayed low toxicity, which was similar with our previous
studies.25,26 Compared with semiconductor quantum dots,
this fascinating advantage gives CPDs a great potential to be a promising
bioprobe in the future clinical applications.27,28

in C6 brain glioma cells. The values are represented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD) (n = 6).

2.3 Physiological Stability
of CPDs
The surface charge and size were investigated to
evaluate the physiological stability of CPDs after 2 h incubation
with C6 cells. We found the ζ-potential of CPDs did not significantly
change after 2 h incubation with C6 cells, indicating the good stability
of surface state of CPDs. Some medium electron dense particles within
an endocytic vesicle of the cytoplasm were observed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, Figure S1B).
Moreover, high-resolution TEM image (Figure S1C) showed that the size of these particles was similar with CPDs,25 which further confirmed the excellent physiological
stability of CPDs after entering the cells.

2.4 Cellular Uptake of CPDs
To understand
the cellular behaviors of CPDs on C6 glioma cells, the cellular uptake
kinetics of CPDs should be elucidated first. The cells were exposed
to 200 μg mL–1 CPDs for a series of time periods
(5–120 min), and the fluorescence intensity of cells was then
detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to evaluate
the uptake amount of CPDs. As shown in Figure 2A, after 5 min incubation, the CPDs could
enter the cells and yield bright red fluorescence, suggesting their
great potential for glioma imaging.14,29 Moreover, the
enhanced fluorescence intensity of cells was observed over time and
CPDs showed a strong red fluorescence at 120 min incubation. CPDs
also exhibited highly efficient internalization in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which could be used to establish an
in vitro BBB model (Figure S2). Subsequently,
C6 cells were exposed to CPDs at different concentrations (50–200
μg mL–1) for 1 h. The cellular uptake of CPDs
would also enhance when increasing the concentration of CPDs (Figure 2B). These
results suggested that the internalization of CPDs into C6 cells involved
in time- and dose-dependent procedures was consistent with the behaviors
of other nanoparticles.30−33

behaviors of CPDs
in C6 cells. (A) C6 cellular uptake of CPDs for different times; (B)

bar represents 20 μm. (C, D) Subcellular localization of CPDs
in C6 cells was investigated using organelle-specific probes: Hoechst
33342 (a blue nuclear dye), LysoTracker Green DND-26, and MitoTracker
Green were used to localize the nucleus, lysosomes, and mitochondria,
respectively; the yellow fluorescence in the merged image showed the
colocalization of CPDs and lysosomes; the scale bar represents 10
μm.
The representative areas are magnified optically.

2.5 Subcellular Location of CPDs
We further
evaluated the intracellular localization of CPDs in C6 cells using
costaining methods with two organelle-specific probes, including LysoTracker
Green DND-26 and MitoTracker Green. As shown in Figure 2C, the yellow fluorescence could be observed
in the merged image, which demonstrated that internalized CPDs mainly
distributed in lysosomes. However, CPDs could not be transported to
the mitochondria because there was no significant colocalization of
CPDs with MitoTracker Green in Figure 2D. Moreover, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Rr) was calculated to confirm these results. Rr for LysoTracker Green DND-26 was 0.57, suggesting
the good colocalization between CPDs and lysosomes. However, Rr for MitoTracker Green was −1, indicating
no colocalization between CPDs and MitoTracker Green. Therefore, we
inferred that endolysosomal structures mediated the internalization
of CPDs in C6 cells, which was the most common manner for cells to
take up nanoparticles (NPs).34,35

In general, different
characteristics of NPs would influence their cellular internalization
and distribution, which were directly associated with their biosafety
and potential biomedical applications.36−38 Our study indicated that the internalized CPDs located
mainly within lysosomes but not significantly entered the mitochondria.
We speculated that the nanometer size and surface ζ-potential
of CPDs played a critical role in their internalization and distribution
in C6 cells.39−41 In
addition, CPDs could serve as nanocarriers for drug delivery due to
their subcellular distribution.42,43 No obvious entrance
of CPDs to the mitochondria might explain their low cytotoxicity owing
to the negligible interference to the mitochondrial respiratory chain.26,44

2.6 BBB-Penetration
Ability of CPDs in Vitro
To evaluate the BBB-penetration
capability of CPDs in vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) and C6 brain glioma cells were used to establish an in vitro
BBB model. The process of constructing an in vitro BBB model is displayed
using a schematic diagram in Figure 3A–C. This BBB model was very close to the in
vivo BBB in morphology and function.45,46 As shown in Figure 3D, the transendothelial
electrical resistance (TEER) was measured to assess and monitor the
integrity of the in vitro BBB every day. The high TEER values obtained
suggested that the coculture BBB model could be successfully established
to mimic the microenvironment of in vivo BBB.47,48 Before
investigating the BBB-penetration capability of CPDs, an MTT assay
was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CPDs at a concentration
of 2 mg mL–1 on HUVEC and C6 cells. After 2 h incubation
with CPDs (2 mg mL–1), the cell viability of HUVEC
and C6 cells remained above 90%, indicating that 2 mg mL–1 of CPDs could not significantly damage the integrity of the BBB
model (Figure 4).

CPDs in vitro. (A–C) Schematic diagram of the preparation and
application of the in vitro BBB model: (A) the 12-well plates were

lower compartment containing the CPDs could be detected. (D) Time-dependent
TEER values of the in vitro BBB model (n = 3, mean

(n = 6, mean ± SD).

Figure 4 Viability of C6 cells
and HUVEC after incubation with
2 mg mL–1 of CPDs for 2 h (n =
6, mean ± SD).

The BBB-penetration capability of the CPDs was evaluated via detecting
the florescence intensity of the BBB-penetrating CPDs, which accumulated
in the lower compartment of a BBB model (Figure 3C). As shown in Figure 3E, the percentage of BBB-penetrating CPDs
reached the highest after 60 min incubation and could maintain 20–40%
within 120 min incubation, suggesting the excellent BBB-penetration
capability of the CPDs. The BBB could prohibit the effective delivery
of therapeutics from circulating blood to the central nervous system,
which was mainly attributed to the tight junctions of endothelial
cells.49,50 However, the intercellular tight junctions
have 4–6 nm gaps in the blood–brain barrier.51 Therefore, we inferred that the CPDs could cross
the BBB through such gaps because the size of CPDs was around 5.74
nm. In addition, the cationic surface charge on CPDs also increased
the permeability of BBB by charge neutralization, leading to an enhanced
transcytosis of CPDs through the blood–brain barrier.52,53 CPDs exhibited highly efficient internalization in HUVEC and C6
cells according to our previous studies, so we speculated that the
actual percentages of BBB-penetrating CPDs were higher than the measured
values. Therefore, CPDs could be used as excellent bioprobes or nanocarriers
for the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders due to their high
BBB-penetration ability.8,54,55

2.7 BBB-Penetration
Ability of CPDs in Vivo
The BBB permeability of CPDs was
further demonstrated in vivo using normal Sprague-Dawley rats. The
rats were administrated with CPDs (30 mg kg–1, 200
μL) through the tail vein injection. After different time intervals,
the brain tissues of rats were harvested and imaged with an in vivo
optical imaging system (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper). As shown in Figure 5, we observed the
bright red fluorescence signal of CPDs at 1 h postinjection, suggesting
that CPDs could penetrate the blood–brain barrier and relatively
uniformly distribute within the brain tissue. Moreover, there was
still fluorescence signal in the brain at 24 h after injection, indicating
that CPDs had long circulation lifetime and could be retained in the
brain for a long time. These results implied that CPDs could pass
through the BBB in physiological conditions, which was the attractive
advantage for NPs and was first reported for carbon-based nanomaterials
to the best of our knowledge.56−58 Diagnosis of patients with brain tumors at an early time point remains
an intractable problem in the clinic. Therefore, CPDs have potential
clinical application in early stage diagnosis and treatment of brain
disorders, when the blood–brain barrier is not disrupted or
loosened.8,59 In addition, CPDs also have the promise
to noninvasively target many malignant brain tumors with uncompromised
BBB, such as glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma.9

ability of
CPDs in vivo.

2.8 In Vivo and ex Vivo Imaging of Orthotopic Glioma-Bearing Rats
The orthotopic glioma models were established to investigate the
targeting effect of CPDs. MRI was used to determine the tumor progression
at 13 days after implantation, indicating the successful establishment
of orthotopic glioma model (Figure 6A). After intravenous injection of CPDs via the tail,
in vivo and ex vivo imagings of the brain tissues of C6 glioma-bearing
rats were performed using an in vivo optical imaging system. As shown
in Figure S3, CPDs could pass through the
BBB and target the glioma, suggesting that the long-wavelength emission
of CPDs facilitated the in vivo imaging of glioma and avoided autofluorescence
from the skull and scalp. In addition, the outline of brain glioma
was consistent with that of the ex vivo imaging in Figure 6B,C, which further confirmed
the targeting potential of CPDs for brain tumor. We observed that
CPDs could rapidly penetrate the BBB and reach the tumor site at 15
min after the injection, indicating that the intracerebral distribution
of CPDs could be dynamically tracked due to the good tissue penetration
capability of red fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity of CPDs
in brain tumor reached the highest at 60 min and still remained strong
even at 120 min, which was in good agreement with the in vitro BBB-penetration
study of CPDs, demonstrating the high photostability and glioma targeting
efficiency of CPDs. To further prove the targeting glioma by CPDs,
tissue slices were prepared and detected by fluorescence microscopy.
As shown in Figure S4, CPDs displayed higher
distribution in glioma than that in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus
of brain, suggesting that CPDs could target on brain glioma rather
than normal brain tissues.

after implantation; the red arrows indicated the tumor tissues. (B)

tissues. (C) Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of brains at selected time
points.

Generally, NPs could target a tumor
due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.60 However, the pore size of brain tumor vasculature
is much smaller than that of peripheral tumors.61 For example, Sarin et al. found that the up-limit pore
size of brain tumor vasculature would be less than 20 nm,62 whereas for extracranial tumors, the pore size
was up to 1–5 μm.63 In addition,
NPs smaller than 5 nm were not suitable to serve as bioprobes for
brain tumor imaging owing to their rapid excretion via renal filtration.64 In this study, the diameter of CPDs is around
5.74 nm, which may contribute to the EPR effect and the prolonged
circulation lifetime, leading to a high intratumoral accumulation.35 Adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) is recognized
as another important way of NPs crossing BBB.16 AMT involves electrostatic interaction between the positive-charged
NPs and the negative-charged endothelial cells. Therefore, the cationic
CPDs could potentially facilitate their intratumoral delivery via
AMT.65 Overall, the combination of the
upregulated BBB permeability, the EPR effect, the transcytosis via
AMT, and the excellent tissue penetration ability of red fluorescence
contributes to the high target to background signal ratio of CPDs
to brain tumor.

Furthermore, CPDs could also clearly delineate
the brain tumor boundary, demonstrating the feasibility of CPDs to
surgically visualize and locate the brain tumor.66 Veiseh et al. found that an iron oxide nanoprobe could
visualize the brain tumor in vivo but the tumor tissue was precisely
defined at 48 h after injection due to the slow BBB-penetration of
the probe.67 Therefore, our nanoprobe with
rapid intratumoral distribution and bright red fluorescence emission
in neoplastic tissues is highly desirable to the oncologist. Because
of the high tumor to normal tissue ratio of CPDs in the ex vivo fluorescence
imaging studies, we infer that this nanoprobe holds the promise to
provide real-time fluorescence imaging guidance during surgery to
completely remove tumor tissues while minimizing the impairment of
surrounding healthy neurological tissues.

3 Conclusions
In summary, CPDs possess
long excitation/emission wavelengths, low toxicity, high photostability,
and excellent biocompatibility. CPDs exhibit high internalization
in glioma cells in time- and dose-dependent procedures, and internalized
CPDs locate mainly in endolysosomal structures. In vitro and in vivo
studies confirmed the BBB permeability of CPDs, contributing to the
early stage diagnosis of brain disorders and the noninvasive visualization
of the brain tumor without compromised BBB. In addition, CPDs could
successfully distribute into the orthotopic brain glioma with high
target to background signal ratio in vivo, demonstrating the feasibility
to localize the brain tumor before surgery. Furthermore, owing to
the high tumor to normal tissue ratio of CPDs under ex vivo conditions,
our nanoprobe holds the promise to guide brain-tumor resection by
real-time fluorescence imaging during surgery. Currently, on the basis
of these desirable results, we are performing further research on
the photothermal therapy effect of CPDs for malignant brain tumors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from HyClone.
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Ausgenex (Australia).
Penicillin–streptomycin and trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid were obtained from Genview. DAPI, Hoechst 33342, LysoTracker
Green DND-26, and MitoTracker Green were obtained from Thermo Fisher
Scientific. Tetrazolium salt (MTT) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Synthesis of CPDs
CPDs were synthesized by one-step
hydrothermal technology according to our previous work.25 Briefly, 0.5 mmol oPD was dissolved
in 10 mL of deionized water, 50 μL of HNO3 (0.725
mmol) was added to it, and stirred well. The solution was then transferred
to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) Teflon-lined autoclave (25 mL) and
heated at 200 °C for 10 h. Next, the reactor was cooled to room
temperature. Finally, the CPDs solution was obtained through a 0.22
μm poly(ether sulfone) membrane and further dialyzed in a 500
Da dialysis bag.

4.3 Cell Culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
and C6 cells were used in this study and obtained from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. The cells were cultivated in DMEM in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C. The DMEM growth medium contained 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (10 000 U mL–1 penicillin and 10 000 μg mL–1 streptomycin).

4.4 Cytotoxicity
C6 glioma cells (1 × 104 cells per well) were seeded
into a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. After that, the medium was replaced by CPDs at a series
of concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 μg mL–1 and the incubation was then continued for another 24 h. Subsequently,
the medium containing the CPDs in each well was removed and replaced
with 180 μL of serum-free medium and 20 μL of MTT solution
(5 mg mL–1). After further incubation for 4 h at
37 °C, the culture medium containing MTT in each well was replaced
with 200 μL of DMSO to dissolve the formazan crystals, followed
by shaking for 10 min. Finally, the absorbance of all wells was measured
at 490 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek). The cell viability was
obtained through the use of an absorbance percentage relative to the
CPD-untreated cells.

4.5 Physiological Stability of CPDs
C6 cells were seeded into
six-well culture plates (1 × 105 cells per well),
incubated overnight, and then treated with CPDs (200 μg mL–1) for another 2 h incubation. After that, the medium
containing CPDs was filtrated and the ζ-potential of the filtrate
solution was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments).
Meanwhile, the cells were washed, trypsinized, harvested, and centrifuged
and then the collected samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde at
4 °C overnight. This was followed by postfixation with 1% osmium
tetroxide, dehydration, and infiltration. Then, the samples were embedded
in Epon resin and thin-sectioned with 70 nm using a RMC PowerTome-XL
ultramicrotome. Finally, the prepared sections were observed with
a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan).

4.6 Cellular Uptake of CPDs
C6 cells were seeded in 35 mm cell culture dishes at a density
of 4 × 104 cells per dish and incubated overnight
at 37 °C for CLSM imaging. To investigate the influence of incubation
time, CPDs with a concentration of 200 μg mL–1 were incubated with C6 cells for a series of time periods (5, 30,
60, and 120 min). Then, the cells were rinsed three times and imaged
using an Olympus IX81 confocal laser scanning microscope (Japan) with
excitation/emission wavelengths at 559/570–670 nm. The similar
procedures were performed to reveal the cellular uptake of CPDs in
HUVEC for different time periods (5, 30, and 60 min). To identify
the dose-dependent uptake kinetics of CPDs, CPDs with various concentrations
(50, 100, 150, and 200 μg mL–1) were incubated
with the C6 cells for 1 h. The fluorescence intensity of cells was
then detected using CLSM.

4.7 Subcellular Location of CPDs
C6 cells were seeded in
dishes and incubated overnight as described above. We used organelle-specific
probes, including LysoTracker Green DND-26 and MitoTracker Green to
determine intracellular distribution of CPDs by detecting the colocalization
of CPDs with lysosomes and mitochondria, respectively. CPDs with a
concentration of 200 μg mL–1 were incubated
with the cells for 5 min. LysoTracker Green DND-26 (75 nM) was then
co-incubated with the cells for 85 min. Subsequently, the cells were
incubated with Hoechst 33342 (0.6 μg mL–1),
which served as the blue fluorescence dye to locate the nucleus. After
another 5 min incubation time, the cells were rinsed three times and
examined using CLSM.

To investigate the colocalization of CPDs
with mitochondria, CPDs (200 μg mL–1) were
incubated with the cells for 30 min. The cells were then co-incubated
with MitoTracker Green (33 nM) for 15 min, followed by the incubation
with Hoechst 33342 (0.6 μg mL–1) for another
5 min. Finally, the cells were rinsed and imaged using CLSM. For CLSM
imaging, excitation/emission wavelengths of Hoechst 33342, LysoTracker
Green DND-26, MitoTracker Green, and CPDs were 405/425–475,
488/500–545, 488/500–545, and 559/575–675 nm,
respectively.

4.8 BBB-Penetration
Ability of CPDs in Vitro
Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) and C6 brain glioma cells were used to establish an
in vitro BBB model according to the previous studies.68 First, the polycarbonate membranes of 12-well transwell
plates (Corning Incorporated) were coated with rat-tail type I collagen
before use. The 12-well plates were seeded with 1.5 mL of C6 cells
at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well. When the C6
cells had successfully attached to the well surface, HUVEC at a density
of 2 × 105 cells mL–1 (0.5 mL) were
seeded into the transwell inserts and incubated to construct an in
vitro BBB model through no-contact coculture. Subsequently, we evaluated
the function of the BBB model through measuring the transendothelial
electrical resistance (TEER) every day using a Millicell-ERS (Millipore).
The following experiments were conducted on the fifth day when TEER
reached more than 200 Ω cm2. Previous studies had
proved that the in vitro BBB model could produce reasonable permeability
outcomes when TEER was >150 Ω cm2.69

The CPDs at a concentration of 2 mg mL–1 in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) was
investigated with the in vitro BBB model. Before that, an MTT assay
was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CPDs (2 mg mL–1) after 2 h incubation with HUVEC and C6 cells. CPDs (2 mg mL–1) were added into the transwell lumen of BBB model
culture. After predetermined incubation intervals (30, 60, 90, and
120 min), the fluid in the lower compartment containing the CPDs,
which had penetrated the biomimetic BBB in vitro, was withdrawn and
moved into a 96-well plate for detecting the fluorescence signal at
590/20 nm excitation and 645/40 nm emission wavelengths using a microplate
reader (BioTek). The percentage of CPDs that crossed the BBB was calculated
on the basis of the fluorescence intensity of the fluid in the lower
compartment.

4.9 BBB-Penetration
Ability of CPDs in Vivo
Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats
were chosen to serve as an in vivo BBB model to assess the BBB-penetration
ability of CPDs. First, CPDs in PBS solution (30 mg kg–1, 200 μL) were injected into the rats through the tail vein.
After different time periods (1 and 24 h), the rats were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection with 10% of chloral hydrate (300 mg kg–1). After that, the transcardiac perfusion with saline
was performed for these rats. Then, the brain tissue of rats was exposed
and harvested. Finally, the fluorescence signal of brain tissue was
measured by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS Spectrum, Caliper) at
the suitable excitation (Ex)/emission (Em) wavelengths (Ex/Em: 570/640
nm).

4.10 In Vivo and
ex Vivo Imaging of Orthotopic Glioma-Bearing Rats
The establishment
of orthotopic glioma model was performed according to previous studies.70 Briefly, male Wistar rats (200–210 g)
were anesthetized with 10% of chloral hydrate and immobilized on a
stereotaxic apparatus. A sagittal incision was adopted to expose the
cranium. Then, a hole was drilled at a point located at 1 mm anterior
to the coronal suture and 3 mm right-lateral to the sagittal suture.
Subsequently, 10 μL of PBS containing 6 × 105 C6 glioma cells was slowly and gently injected into the target point
of the brain. Tumor growth was determined by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) with a 1.5T scanner (Siemens Avanto, Germany) 13 days later.
The C6 glioma-bearing rats were administered with 50 mg kg–1 of CPDs through the tail vein injection at 15 days after implantation.
At different time points after injection, the fluorescent distribution
of the brain was detected using an in vivo optical imaging system
(IVIS Spectrum, Caliper). After that, the rats were sacrificed and
then their brain tissues were harvested and photographed by a camera.
Finally, the ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed for these
brain tissues. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the brain
tissues were further dehydrated using 30% sucrose. Then, consecutive
frozen sections with 10 μm thickness were prepared and stained
with 0.5 μg mL–1 of DAPI for 5 min. The fluorescence
distribution of brain tissues was observed using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence
microscopy (Japan).

4.11 Live Subjects
All animal experiments were performed according
to the protocols approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee
of Jilin University in China.
