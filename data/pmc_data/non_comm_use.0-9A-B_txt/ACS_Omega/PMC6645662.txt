Zinc oxide (ZnO)
thin-film transistors (TFTs) have many promising
applications in the areas of logic circuits, displays, ultraviolet
detectors, and biosensors due to their high performances, facile fabrication
processing, and low cost. The solution method is an important technique
for low-cost and large fabrication of oxide semiconductor TFTs. However,
a key challenge of solution-processable ZnO TFTs is the relatively
high processing temperature (≥500 °C) for achieving high
carrier mobility. Here, facile, low-cost, and solution-processable
ZnO TFTs were fabricated under the annealing temperature of ≤300
°C. Dense and polycrystalline ZnO films were deposited by the
spin-coating method. The ZnO TFTs showed the maximum electron mobility
of 11 cm2/V s and a high on/off ratio of >107 when the ZnO thin films were annealed at 300 °C. The mobility
was extremely high among solution-processable undoped ZnO TFTs reported
previously, even better than some high-cost indium-doped ZnO TFTs
fabricated at low temperature. Furthermore, it is found that the mechanism
of oxygen vacancies dominates the electron transport in ZnO thin film
and interface behaviors of ZnO thin film and SiO2 gate
insulator, and then dominates the performances of devices.

1 Introduction
In the last decade, metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs) have attracted
much attention due to their applications in the field of thin-film
transistors (TFTs).1 The mobility of oxide
TFTs can be higher than that of amorphous silicon devices, even reaching
the level of polycrystalline silicon, which can make oxide TFTs the
promising candidates in the applications of the active matrix organic
light-emitting diode displays, photodetectors, and biosensors. Furthermore,
because of the high transparency of metal oxide semiconductors,2 they also can be applied in transparent electronic
devices. The key component for transparent electronics is the wide
band gap oxide semiconductor.3 Among metal
oxide semiconductors, the wide band gap zinc oxide (ZnO) (3.37 eV)
has caught the attention of many researchers due to its high electron
mobility, high optical transparency, and low cost. In the past years,
the significant improvement has been made in ZnO thin-film transistors
prepared by several techniques,4−7 such as atomic layer deposition and radio frequency
magnetron sputtering. However, these techniques require high vacuum
system, which limits their application in low-cost and large-area
electronics.8 An alternative method to
resolve this issue is to develop low-temperature and solution-processable
ZnO thin-film transistors.2 The TFTs of
ZnO have been reported by using a carbon-free aqueous Zn(OH)2(NH3)x solution.9−14 Meyers et al.10 reported that the ZnO
TFTs were fabricated by spin-coating the Zn(OH)2 precursor
solution and the high carrier mobility of 4.3 cm2/V s were
achieved when the TFT channels were annealed at 300 °C in the
N2 glovebox. Very recently, Lin et al.9 have employed ZnO·xH2O
as raw materials to fabricate ZnO TFTs by spin-coating. The TFTs were
annealed at 180 °C in the N2 glovebox and the high
carrier mobility of 11 cm2/V s was obtained. However, compared
to commercial Zn(OH)2 and ZnO raw materials, ZnO·xH2O was difficult to be synthesized and was
not stable, which would hamper its application in the future.

To obtain the devices with high carrier mobility, the multicomponent
oxide semiconductors-based ZnO, such as indium–zinc oxide (IZO),
indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO), and tin–zinc
oxide (ZTO), have been synthesized by solution processing and successfully
integrated in TFTs.1,15−17 In 2015, Sirringhaus
et al.1 reported that the IZO TFTs were
fabricated by solution processing, and the high carrier mobility of
12 cm2/V s was obtained when the IZO thin films were annealed
at 300 °C in the vacuum. However, the vacuum system was required,
which would lead to high cost. On the other hand, most of the dopant
materials in ZnO were the novel metal, and doping process would add
to the complexity of device fabrication. Therefore, it is necessary
to explore the simple and low-cost solution processing to fabricate
high-performance oxide TFTs.

In this work, we used commercial
ZnO as the raw material of precursor
solution and successfully fabricated the high-performance undoped
ZnO TFTs with the annealing temperature of ≤300 °C. The
obtained TFTs showed the carrier mobility of 11 cm2/V s
and the on/off ratio of >107 at 300 °C. Even when
the annealing temperature of ZnO thin film decreased to 200 °C,
the TFTs still indicated a high electron mobility of >3 cm2/V s and a high on/off ratio of >106. We also
investigated
the influence of oxygen vacancies in ZnO thin film on the electrical
properties of TFTs, which would guide to fabricate the high-performance
oxide TFTs.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the crystallized ZnO thin
films annealed at the temperature between 200 and 500 °C.
The three strong and narrow diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns
were observed clearly, which implied a good crystallization of the
ZnO thin films. The three strong peaks corresponded to the (100),
(002), and (101) planes of the hexagonal wurtzite structure. Interestingly,
the diffraction density ratio of (002) and (100) plane increased when
annealing temperature increased from 200 to 300 °C. However,
the diffraction density ratio of (002) and (101) plane decreased when
the annealing temperature exceeded 300 °C. Therefore, the ZnO
thin film annealed at 300 °C had the most preferred orientation
of (002) plane. Figure 1b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the surface
morphology of ZnO thin film annealed at 300 °C in the N2 glovebox. The annealed ZnO thin film was dense and uniform. The
dense and uniform ZnO grains were beneficial to the transportation
of electrons in the ZnO thin film. Further, the surface of ZnO thin
films annealed at the temperature between 200 and 500 °C in the
glovebox was characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). It
was found that all of the surfaces of ZnO thin films were very smooth. Figure 1c shows the AFM image
of the ZnO film annealed at 300 °C in the glovebox. It could
be seen that the thin film of ZnO prepared by this simple solution-processable
method showed an extremely smooth surface morphology with a root mean
square roughness (RRMS) of 0.23 nm. In
the polycrystalline oxide semiconductors, low surface roughness was
important in establishing effective charge percolation pathways.18−22 The low roughness of ZnO surface was possibly one of reasons that
ZnO TFTs demonstrated a high carrier mobility. The detailed electrical
performances of ZnO TFTs would be discussed later. On the other hand,
the surface roughness of ZnO thin film annealed at 200 °C in
the ambient air was also investigated (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Compared to ZnO thin film
annealed in the glovebox, ZnO thin film annealed in the ambient air
indicated higher roughness.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of ZnO thin films annealed
at the temperatures
of 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 °C. (b) SEM image of ZnO thin
film annealed at 300 °C. (c) AFM image (scan size: 2 μm
× 2 μm) of ZnO thin film with a root mean square roughness
(RRMS) of 0.23 nm. All of the ZnO thin
films were prepared by spin coating the precursor solution onto the
SiO2/Si2+ substrates for one time with 3000
rpm for 30 s and thermal annealing for 30 min at 300 °C in the
glovebox. (d) Transmission spectra of blank glass and ZnO thin films
deposited on the glass annealed at 200, 250, and 300 °C.

As shown in Figure 1d, the transmittances of ZnO thin films on
the glass annealed at
200, 250, and 300 °C were investigated. It is clear that all
of the samples exhibited an outstanding high transmittance (>90%)
for all of the wavelengths in the range of 400–1200 nm. The
clear absorption characteristic for all of the thin films appeared
at around 380 nm, which implied that ZnO thin films had extremely
high transparency in the entire visible region. Therefore, this type
of low-cost, solution-processable ZnO TFTs could be promising in the
applications of transparent electronics.23

Generally, the carrier transport properties of ZnO semiconductor
were closely related to the chemical states of ZnO thin films, such
as oxygen vacancies. To investigate the chemical states of ZnO thin
films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were carried
out on the ZnO thin films annealed at the temperature between 200
and 500 °C, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 2a–e shows the O 1s XPS spectra of ZnO thin films annealed
at the temperature of 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 °C in sequence.
The O 1s peak could be fitted by three components representing three
different states:24−26 (1) O2– in a wurtzite structure
surrounded by Zn atoms at low binding energy (O–M); (2) oxygen
vacancies at medium binding energy (O-deficient); and (3) OH species
and/or aqueous adsorbed on the surface of ZnO film at a high binding
energy (O–H). As shown in Figure 2a–f, the O–H groups decreased
with the increase in annealing temperature. However, O–M and
O-deficient groups demonstrated the different variation tendency.
The O–M groups had little variation when the ZnO thin films
annealed at the temperature of ≤300 °C, which implied
that the O–H groups mainly converted to O-deficient groups
during the low temperature phase. When the annealing temperature exceeded
300 °C, the O–M groups began to increase and O-deficient
groups began to decrease at the same time. The possible reason was
that more oxygen vacancies began to be filled by free oxygen atoms
outside the wurtzite structure during the high-temperature phase.
The oxygen atoms were easier to enter the atom gaps because the atom
gaps of wurtzite structure enlarged or dynamic energy of atoms increased
when the temperature was elevated. These oxygen atoms filled the vacancies
after cooling down and converted to O–M groups finally. In
general, higher concentration of oxygen vacancy usually induced higher
carrier concentration, which elevated the Fermi level and shift VT to the negative direction.27,28 Therefore, ZnO TFTs with the ZnO annealing temperature of ≤300
°C demonstrated excellent performances of TFTs, which would be
discussed later.

(f) Area ratio of the three peaks (O–M groups, O-deficient
groups, O–H groups) at the temperature of 200, 250, 300, 400,
and 500 °C.

First, the influence
of annealing atmosphere on TFT’s performances
has been investigated. The ZnO thin films were annealed at 200 °C
in the glovebox and ambient air, respectively. Their electrical properties
of TFTs are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows the transfer characteristics of ZnO TFTs annealed
in the glovebox and air. It was obvious that device annealed in the
glovebox had a higher field-effect mobility and a higher on/off ratio
than those annealed in the air. For the ZnO thin film annealed in
the glovebox, the high carrier mobility of 3.26 cm2/V s
and high on/off ratio of 106 were obtained, respectively.
However, the carrier mobility of device annealed in the air was just
0.32 cm2/V s that was 1 order of magnitude lower than that
annealed in the glovebox, which was consistent with the previous results
reported by Anthopoulos et al.9 When the
ZnO thin films were annealed in the glovebox, ZnO thin films were
easy to form oxygen vacancies and accumulated high concentration of
oxygen vacancies due to the lack of O2 atmospheres. The
high concentration of oxygen vacancies was beneficial to electron
transport in ZnO thin films and resulted in high carrier mobility.27 On the other hand, the turn-on voltage (Von) of N2-annealed device shifted
to negative gate bias. It suggested that N2 annealing would
lead to the positive charge doping in the interface of the semiconductor
and the insulator. It was attributed to the increase in oxygen vacancies
when the device was annealed in the glovebox. Figure 3b shows the output characteristic of ZnO
transistor annealed at 200 °C in the glovebox. It was clear that
the output curve of the transistor annealed in the glovebox showed
a negligible hysteresis. However, the output curve of the transistor
annealed in the air showed an obvious hysteresis (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The
large hysteresis of output curve and low on/off ratio in ZnO TFT was
because the interface of SiO2 and ZnO thin film got worse
when the ZnO thin film was annealed in the air.

of ZnO TFTs annealed at 200 °C

TFTs annealed at 200 °C in the glovebox. (c) Transfer and (d)
output characteristics of ZnO TFT prepared by Zn(OH)2 precursor
solution at the annealing temperature of 200 °C in the glovebox.

To investigate the precursor solution
influence on the performances
of ZnO TFTs,10−12 the ZnO TFTs were also fabricated by using the precursor
solution of Zn(OH)2 in ammonium hydroxide. The detail preparation
processing of the precursor solution and TFTs could be seen in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. Figure 3c,d shows the transfer
and output characteristics of the devices fabricated by using Zn(OH)2 precursor solution. The extracted saturation mobility of
ZnO TFT was about 0.9 cm2/V s, which could be comparable
to those of ZnO TFTs prepared by solution processing at the same temperature
in previous studies.29,30 On the other hand, the obvious
hysteresis of output curve could be observed, as shown in Figure 3d. Therefore, the
mobility of ZnO TFTs prepared by the precursor of Zn(OH)2 was much lower than those of the ZnO TFTs prepared by the precursor
of ZnO in ammonium hydroxide. The as-prepared film by Zn(OH)2 precursor solution needs extra energy during the dissociation procedure
in contrast with the ZnO precursor solution. When the films are annealed
at the same temperature, the films deposited from Zn(OH)2 precursor solution need extra energy to make Zn(OH)2 to
decompose into ZnO, which leads to the deposited films having inferior
crystallinity. On the other hand, the precursor solution had a large
influence on layer morphology. The surface roughness of film deposited
from Zn(OH)2 at 200 °C in the glovebox was characterized
(see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).
It could be found that the film deposited from the Zn(OH)2 precursor solution has a rougher surface with the root mean square
roughness (RRMS) of 0.74 nm.

The
annealing temperature of ZnO thin films was also investigated
for optimizing the performances of ZnO TFTs. Figure 4a shows the transfer curves of ZnO TFTs annealed
at the temperature between 200 and 500 °C in the glovebox. The Von shifted to the negative gate bias when the
annealing temperature of ZnO thin film increased from 200 to 300 °C,
whereas the Von shifted back to the positive
gate bias when the annealing temperature exceeded 300 °C. This
variable tendency was consistent with oxygen vacancies in the ZnO
thin film measured by XPS. The Von was
closely relative to the density of traps state of the interface. In
other words, the mechanism of oxygen vacancies dominated the Von shift. Figure 4b shows the dependence of carrier mobilities of ZnO
TFTs on the annealing temperatures of ZnO thin film. The average carrier
mobilities of ZnO TFTs were 3, 4.1, 8.6, 4.2, and 0.4 cm2/V s for the annealing temperature of 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500
°C, respectively. It was clear that the highest average electron
mobility was obtained when the ZnO thin film was annealed at 300 °C.
This was most likely attributed to the high concentration of oxygen
vacancies and high preferred (002) orientation of ZnO thin film when
the ZnO thin film was annealed at 300 °C. These results were
confirmed by XPS and XRD measurements. Figure 4c,d shows the transfer and output characteristics
of the ZnO TFT annealed at 300 °C in the glovebox, respectively.
It was noteworthy that the highest electron mobility of ∼11
cm2/V s and the on/off ratio of >107 were
obtained
when the ZnO thin film was annealed at 300 °C. The carrier mobility
was extremely high among solution-processable undoped ZnO TFTs,10,14,31 even better than some solution-processable
indium-doped ZnO TFTs fabricated at low temperature. More importantly,
the negligible hysteresis of output curves had also been observed,
as shown in Figure 4d. It was very important to employ the ZnO TFTs in the future application.
The high performances could be attributed to the low reaction activation
energy during the process of zinc-ammine dissociation. The ZnO and
ammonium hydroxide could be combined into zinc ammine complex. The
zinc ammine in the solution was not stable and easily decomposed into
ZnO at low temperature. Therefore, the good crystallinity of films
could be obtained when the films were annealed at relatively low temperature,
which lead to high performances even when the ZnO TFTs were annealed
at low temperature.

temperatures

3 Conclusions
In summary, a simple, lost-cost,
solution-processable method has
been developed to fabricate high-performance ZnO TFTs at low temperature.
The performances of ZnO TFTs strongly depend on the annealing temperature
of ZnO thin films. The mechanism of oxygen vacancies dominates the
electron transport in ZnO thin film and interface behaviors between
ZnO thin film and SiO2 gate insulator, and then dominates
the performances of the devices. The ZnO TFTs annealed at 300 °C
exhibit maximum electron mobility of 11 cm2/V s and a high
on/off ratio of >107. Furthermore, when the annealing
temperature
is reduced to 200 °C, the ZnO TFT still shows excellent performances
with the electron mobility of >3 cm2/V s and the on/off
ratio of >106. This effort shows extreme attraction
in
the applications of lost-cost, large-area, flexible devices as well
as transparent electronics.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Precursor Solution
The precursor
solution was obtained by directly dissolving pure ZnO powder (99.99%,
Aldrich) in ammonium hydroxide (>28%) at the concentration of 8
mg/mL.
Then, the complex solution were stirred rigorously at room temperature
for 12 h and filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filter to remove the insoluble substance before using. The process
of dissolution can be expressed as  

4.2 Material
Characterization
The surface
morphology was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope
on JEOL7100F and the acceleration voltage was 15 kV. The atomic force
microscope (AFM, Solver Nano) was used to measure to the surface roughness.
The X-ray diffraction patterns were characterized with Bruker Advanced
D8 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation.
The sweep spacing was 0.02°. The operating voltage and current
were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Transmittance spectra were collected
by using Shimadzu UV3600. The surface chemical composition and the
chemical state were characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscope
(XPS, Escalab 250Xi) using Al Kα (binding energy 1486.6 eV).
The XPS spectra fitting were obtained via Avantage. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Titan F30) was used to
measure the particle size distribution of raw ZnO powder (see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information).

4.3 Device Fabrication
The detailed flow
chart of ZnO TFTs is shown in Figure 5. The ZnO TFTs with the architecture of bottom gate
top contact were fabricated by spin-coating processing. The heavily
doped Si with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2 was used as gate
electrode and gate dielectric layer. Before depositing the filtered
precursor solution, the substrates of SiO2/Si2+ were cleaned via acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water
in sequence in ultrasonic cleaning machine. Next, the clean silicon
wafer was treated by O2 plasma for 5 min. Then, the filtered
precursor solution was spin-coated on the substrates of SiO2/Si2+ at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form the active layer. This
process was repeated for several times to obtain the desired thickness
of ZnO films. Afterward, ZnO thin film was annealed on the hot plate
for 30 min in the glovebox or in the air. Finally, Al was evaporated
on the active layer as the source and drain electrodes through shadow
mask. The channel width and length were 2000 and 100 μm, respectively.
