Inositol-requiring
enzyme 1 (IRE1) is an orchestrator of the unfolded
protein response (UPR), the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress that plays a crucial role in tumor development. IRE1 signaling
is the most evolutionary conserved branch of the UPR. Under ER stress,
the IRE1 luminal domain undergoes a conformational change to multimerize,
resulting in trans-autophosphorylation and activation of the cytosolic
kinase and endoribonuclease domain. Adenosine triphosphate-competitive
inhibitors that bind to the IRE1 kinase site can modulate the activity
of the RNase domain through an allosteric relationship between the
IRE1 kinase and RNase domains. The current study aims at the investigation
of available structural data of the IRE1 kinase domain and provides
insights into the design of novel kinase inhibitors. To this end,
a detailed analysis of IRE1 kinase active site and investigation of
suitable structures for virtual screening studies were performed.
The results indicate in silico target fishing as an appropriate strategy
for the identification of novel IRE1 kinase binders, further validating
the robustness of the in silico protocol. Importantly, the study highlights
the kinase-inhibiting RNase attenuator (KIRA)-bound protein data bank
4U6R structure as the best protein structure to perform virtual screening
to develop diverse and more potent KIRA-like IRE1 kinase inhibitors
that are capable of allosterically affecting the RNase activity.

1 Introduction
The
failure of cells to appropriately fold and modify secretory
and transmembrane proteins leads to the accumulation of misfolded
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 Under these conditions of “ER stress”, the unfolded
protein response (UPR) is initiated by the activation of three sensor
proteins on the ER membrane: inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1),
protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription
factor 6 (ATF6).2 Among the three branches,
the IRE1 pathway is the most evolutionarily conserved and represents
the sole branch of the UPR in yeast.3 This
pathway plays a critical role in a variety of physiological and disease
conditions, including B cell and adipocyte differentiation, secretory
capacity of pancreatic beta cells and salivary organs, neurodegeneration,
obesity, and insulin resistance.2 Hence,
a detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying mammalian
IRE1 activation is essential to the development of therapeutics.4

IRE1 is an ER-resident type 1 transmembrane
protein that contains
an N-terminal luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic
C-terminal kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) effector domains.5 Mammalian IRE1 is present in two distinct isoforms,
α and β. IRE1α (hereafter called IRE1) is ubiquitously
expressed and plays an important role in how cells and organisms respond
to ER stress, whereas IRE1β is expressed primarily in the epithelial
cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the lung but is absent in
the liver and pancreas and participates in mucosal secretion and lipid
transport in the gut.6

Several X-ray
crystal structures of the IRE1 cytosolic domain in
complex with different exogenous and endogenous ligands are available
in the protein data bank (PDB) (Table 1). The first crystallographic structure of the IRE1
cytosolic domain (PDB code: 2RIO) was arranged in a back-to-back conformation (dimer
interface area: 3800 Å2), with adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) and Mg2+ in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding
site.7 The IRE1 kinase domain has a β-stranded
N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe1 (Figure 1) with Lys599 crucial for kinase activity.8 On the basis of structural and biochemical analyses, the kinase
domain was found to display similarity to several protein kinases,
including proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (c-Src), epidermal
growth factor receptor, PKR, general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2),
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase 1 (MAP2K1).9 The RNase domain, on
the other hand, is unique to IRE1 and was originally named as kinase
extension ribonuclease.7 It is composed
of eight α helices connected via short loops and with His1061
and Tyr1043 reported to be crucial for catalyzing the cleavage of
RNA.7 Crystallographic data (PDB code: 3FBV, PDB code: 3SDM), in vivo and in
vitro data,10 and studies of the kinetics
of RNA cleavage9 have demonstrated the
formation of high-order supramolecular IRE1 multimers. Although different
arrangements of dimeric complexes are crystallized, both back-to-back
(PDB codes: 3SDJ, 3SDM, 3LJ0, 3LJ1, 3LJ2, 3FBV, and 2RIO) and face-to-face
(PDB code: 3P23), the only form compatible with an oligomerization state is the
back-to-back dimer.9

Interest in targeting the IRE1 pathway
as a therapeutic strategy
has prompted the search for highly selective IRE1 modulators.11 Because the RNase activity of IRE1 is essential
for the resolution of ER stress and proper functioning of the UPR,
modulation of this activity is targeted. Several of these efforts
have focused on modulating the RNase domain directly.12 In addition, characterization of the allosteric relationship
between the kinase and RNase domains has allowed for the modulation
of IRE1α with small organic molecules targeting the ATP-binding
site.11,13 The RNase activity can be either enhanced
or reduced by targeting this site.13 The
first characterized compounds inhibiting the kinase domain (type I
IRE1 kinase inhibitors) were found to activate the RNase domain.13 Available IRE1 crystal structures reveal the
conformational changes induced by these inhibitors in the kinase domain
that drive the monomeric form to the active dimeric state, resulting
in RNase activation.13 Recently, an imidazopyrazine
scaffold was discovered to provide a new series of ATP-competitive
inhibitors, called KIRAs, that block the RNase activity through binding
to the kinase domain.13 Whereas type I
IRE1 kinase inhibitors increase the dimerization or oligomerization
state of IRE1 and thus activate the RNase, the KIRAs stabilize the
IRE1 monomeric form and thereby inhibit the RNase activity.1,13 Whereas an active kinase conformation is characterized by a DFG-in
motif and helix-αC-in conformation, KIRA compounds stabilize
the helix-αC-out conformation, thereby hindering dimer formation.13 Interestingly, this chemical scaffold shows
a promising selectivity profile against a series of 100 other kinases.11

In this study, we elucidate atomistic
details of differences in
ligand recognition between exogenous and endogenous ligands in the
IRE1 kinase active site utilizing a range of in silico approaches.
Molecular docking and cross-docking (inverse docking) studies were
performed with available IRE1 protein structures and reported inhibitors.
In general, cross-docking involves docking ligands of a protein to
different crystal structures or different proteins.14 Because crystallographic structures of IRE1 are increasingly
deposited in PDB, the application of docking methods is essential
for both virtual screening (VS) method development and calibrating
scoring functions. These studies could aid structure-based drug design
in the identification of new potent and selective IRE1 kinase modulators.
The analysis can also provide valuable insights for creating focused
small-molecule libraries, thereby increasing the hit rates in drug
discovery screening campaigns toward the IRE1 kinase active site.

2 Methods
2.1 Selection and Preparation
of IRE1 Crystal
Structures
At the time of the current study, six X-ray structures
of yeast IRE1 cocrystallized with small organic molecules in the kinase
active site (exogenous or endogenous compounds), and one apo structure,
were present in PDB15 (Table 1). Three X-ray structures of
IRE1 cocrystallized with the endogenous ligand ADP in the kinase active
site were available for mouse and six X-ray structures cocrystallized
with ADP or exogenous ligands in the kinase active site for human
IRE1, and two apo structures were present (Table 1).

The crystal structures obtained
from PDB were categorized according to holo or apo, that is, whether
or not they have a ligand molecule in their active site. Each crystal
structure was prepared using the Schrödinger protein preparation
wizard.16 Hydrogen atoms were added, and
possible metal binding states were generated. The protonation and
tautomeric states of Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, and His were adjusted to
match a pH of 7.4, and possible orientations of Asn and Gln residues
were generated. Hydrogen bond sampling with the adjustment of active
site water molecule orientations was performed using PROPKA at pH
7.4. Water molecules with fewer than two hydrogen bonds to nonwaters
were deleted. Finally, the protein–ligand complexes were subjected
to geometry refinement using the OPLS2005 force field17 in restrained minimizations.

2.2 Ligand
Preparation
The cocrystallized
ligands (Table 1) and
KIRA analogues13 (Table S1) were extracted and used for cross-docking studies. The
ligands are displayed in Figure 2 and Table S1. The ligands were prepared using Ligprep29 from the Schrödinger suite.30 The OPLS2005 force field17 was used in
all ligand preparation steps. Possible protonation and ionization
states were enumerated for each ligand using an ionizer at pH 7.4.
Possible stereoisomers, tautomeric states, and metal-binding states
were generated.

2.3 Key Interaction
Points
To investigate
the key ligand interactions in a more quantitative manner, we evaluated
the individual electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions to the
interaction energy of each amino acid residue involved in binding
to the corresponding ligands. The electrostatic contribution was calculated
on the basis of the nonbonded electrostatic interaction energy term
of the force field, whereas the hydrophobic contributions were computed
using the directional hydrophobic interaction term based on contact
surfaces as implemented in the molecular operating environment scoring
function.31 As an outcome, an energy (in
kcal/mol) is associated with the electrostatic contribution, whereas
a score (the higher the better) is related to the hydrophobic contribution.
Finally, the interaction energy patterns are displayed as heat maps.
The identification of key residues involved in the interactions highlight
possible patterns in the binding modes of the compounds.

In
this study, the kinase active sites of IRE1 from all three organisms
(S. cerevisiae, M. musculus, and H. sapiens) were characterized
and assessed for their ability to bind druglike molecules. By investigating
the interaction between all ligands in all organisms, selectivity
is addressed from both a ligand and a protein (organism) perspective.

2.4 Molecular Docking
Three sets of docking
studies were performed, each based on the same docking methodology.
In order to validate the suitability of the docking approach, benchmark
studies were first performed in which each ligand was removed and
redocked into the respective protein crystal structure. Following
this, cross-docking studies against the full pool of IRE1 cytosolic
structures were performed. In addition, a set of 25 KIRA analogues
were docked and compared with the available experimental inhibition
data (Table S1). Docking was done using
the Glide program32 in Schrödinger,30 with the receptor grid prepared using the OPLS2005
force field.17 The grid center was set
at the centroid of the cocrystallized ligand, and the cubic grid had
a side length of 20 Å. For the apo structures, the centroid of
Lys599, a residue crucial for the kinase activity, was set to be the
center of the grid. All structures were superposed by the protein
alignment of the kinase domain (i.e., sequence numbers 571–832
of the cytosolic domain; numbering in hIRE1), and the cocrystallized
ligands were docked against each target. No constraints were used
in any of the receptor grids. Flexible ligand sampling was considered
in the docking procedure using the XP (extra precision) docking mode.
All other parameters were set to defaults according to the Glide docking
process. We ranked the compounds by performing a postdocking analysis
in the form of a normalization based on the glide docking score. The
normalization approach suggested by Vigers and Rizzi33 is shown by the following equations: 1   2   3  where Sij is the calculated glide docking score for the ith compound and jth pocket (in kcal mol–1) and Sij′ is the modified score for compound i in the active site j. μi and σi are the
average values and standard deviations of the scores for compound i across all pockets j. Sij′ is also termed the multiple active site correction
(MASC) score.33

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 IRE1 Structural Analysis
In order
to uncover IRE1 kinase active site-specific sequence motifs, multiple
sequence alignments were performed. Sequence similarity and sequence
identity analysis of IRE1 in different species revealed that the primary
sequence of the cytosolic domain of yeast IRE1 has ∼39% sequence
identity compared with that of human IRE1 (hIRE1), whereas murine
IRE1 displays a sequence identity of more than 85% compared to human
IRE1 (Figure S1). The sequence similarity
to hIRE1 is also higher for the murine protein, ∼55% for yeast
IRE1 and >89% for murine IRE1. Furthermore, residue conservation
within
the kinase active site was examined. Identifying residues expected
to be involved in functional specificity and targeting these specific
residues with appropriate small organic molecules could be an attractive
approach to design novel IRE1 modulators. Amino-acid residues at a
distance of 5.0 Å from the cocrystallized ligands in human IRE1
are highly conserved through the species and are highlighted in Figures S1 and S2. The primary structure of the
yeast kinase active site domain of IRE1 shows ∼73% sequence
identity (85% sequence similarity) compared with that of human IRE1,
whereas murine and human IRE1 displays a sequence identity of 100%.
The available structural data were also examined (Figures S4 and S5). On the basis of the superposition of available
structures, the Cα root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) comparison
reveals highly similar conformations among all structures and between
all species (S3, S4, and S5). The three-dimensional (3D) structures
of the cytosolic domain of yeast IRE1 show 1–3 Å displacement
compared with that of human IRE1, whereas murine IRE1 structures display
values between 0.5 and 1.5 Å. Structures 4YZ9 and 3P23 can be considered
as outliers (Figure S4) with slightly higher
rmsd values. In these two structures, the loops display small reorientations
explaining the Cα rmsd deviation. The rmsd deviation of ∼2
Å for 4U6R PDB is due to the ligand-induced displacement of the helix-αC13 (Figure S4).

Also, the amino-acid residues in the IRE1 kinase active site are
highly conserved in terms of 3D conformation among all species (Figure S5). The 3D structure of the yeast kinase
active site domain of IRE1 shows values between 1.78 and 2.79 Å
compared with that of human IRE1, whereas murine IRE1 displays values
between 0.48 and 1.64 Å compared to hIRE1 (Figure S5). Again, 4YZ9 displays the largest deviations in rmsd values.

3.2 Dissecting IRE1 Kinase Active Site Small Organic
Molecule Interactions
One of the aims of the present study
is to investigate and characterize key interactions between bound
ligands and the IRE1 kinase active site residues. From all the crystallographic
data, three heat maps were inferred based on the different organisms
(yeast, murine, and human), and the nature of compounds was analyzed
(exogenous or endogenous). To dissect the ligand-enzyme recognition
system in a more quantitative manner, we calculated the individual
electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions to the interaction energy
of each amino-acid residue within a distance of 5.0 Å from the
cocrystallized ligands.

With the calculated per residue electrostatic
and hydrophobic energy interaction contribution values, the heat maps
depicted in Figure 3 (human) and Supporting Information Figures
S6 and S7 (yeast and murine, respectively) were obtained.

*Dephosphorylated IRE1α cocrystallized with KIRA.13

These analyses provide information regarding structure–activity
relationships. First of all, the different binding modes of endogenous
ligands (ADP) and exogenous ligands are highlighted (cf. Figures 1 and S8). The key interaction points (KIPs) (Figure 3A) indicate several
fundamental groups with favorable electrostatic interaction energy
with the exogenous ligands (colored blue), namely, Lys599, Glu643,
Leu644, Cys645, Ala646, Glu651, and Asp711. On the other hand, the
endogenous ligands cocrystallized in hIRE1 establish a favorable interaction
with Gly580, Thr584, Val586, Ala597, Lys599, Glu643, Leu644, Cys645,
Lys690, and Ser710, whereas repulsive ones are mediated by Glu651,
Asn693, and Asp711. This can be rationalized in terms of the negatively
charged phosphate groups of ADP, absent in the exogenous ligands (Figure 2). In particular,
we note that for the residues on the right half of the electrostatic
interaction map (Figure 3A; residue Ala646 onward), the interaction between endogenous versus
exogenous ligands is essentially reversed. As seen in Figure 1, these residues form the lower
part of the active site cavity, which hence is a more selective/sensitive
region for discriminating between different ligands.

In addition,
from the analysis we see that the hydrophobic interaction
contributes poorly to stabilize the endogenous ligand compared to
exogenous ligands (Figure 3B). For exogenous ligands, hydrophobic interaction is established
with Leu577, Val586, Ile642, and Leu695, whereas only minor hydrophobic
interaction is displayed between ADP and residues Val586 and Leu695.

Comparison of the apo structure (PDB code: 5HGI) with holo structures
cocrystallized with ADP (PDB code: 3P23) or KIRA (PDB code: 4U6R), respectively,
reveals the significant impact on the electrostatic surface and size
of the active site, in the absence or presence of endogenous or exogenous
ligands (Figure 4).

surface representation of the hIRE1 kinase active
site in (A) apo form (PDB code: 5HGI) (B) with the KIRA molecule cocrystallized
(PDB code: 4U6R) and (C) with ADP cocrystallized (PDB code: 3P23). Standard coloring
scheme was used: red for negative, white for neutral, and blue for
positive electrostatic potential.

Analysis of IRE1–ligand interaction in the active
sites
of different species can be useful in validating residues expected
to be involved in ligand binding (Figures S6 and S7). For ADP, the interacting residues crucial for binding
are highly conserved between the different species. Electrostatic
interaction is seen between ADP and Gly580, Lys599, and Lys690 (numbered
according to the human PDB code) in all three organisms (Figures S6 and S7). This confirms the importance
of these interactions for the correct accommodation of the endogenous
ligand in the kinase pocket. Repulsive interaction with Asn693 and
Asp711 is also conserved through the species, as are the hydrophobic
interactions with Val586 and Leu695.

For the exogenous compounds,
comparisons of the binding mode were
only possible with yeast because no exogenous ligands have been cocrystallized
with murine IRE1. Despite the difference between these two organisms,
some useful insights can also be obtained from yeast IRE1. Hydrophobic
interactions between the ligand and Leu577 (Leu680 in yeast), Val586
(Val689 in yeast), and Leu695 (Leu804 in yeast) are very well conserved.
Electrostatic interaction with Lys599 (Lys702 in yeast) and Glu651
(Asp754 in yeast) is not conserved, whereas electrostatic interaction
with Glu643 (Glu746 in yeast), Cys645 (Cys748), and Asn693 (Asn802)
is conserved, underlining the importance of those particular residues
for the correct binding to the target protein.

Hence, albeit
crystal structures are highly similar (low Cα
rmsd), the slight difference in sequence between human and yeast is
clearly reflected in the interaction fingerprints.

3.3 Docking Studies
An essential prerequisite
when performing a docking study is the accessibility of a target structure.
The success of a docking simulation relies heavily on the use of appropriate
and accurate protein structures, with holo structures in general giving
the best performance.34 To evaluate the
performance of different IRE1 structures to host various ligands,
benchmark docking, cross-docking (inverse docking), and evaluation
toward a set of RNase effectors were performed. A protein structure
able to better accommodate the higher number of small organic molecules
with a conformation similar to the cocrystallized one could be considered
a good candidate for VS studies. Throughout this work, the entire
pool of IRE1 crystallographic structures was used (Table 1), and all cocrystallized ligands
(Figure 2) available
from the experimental studies. The pipeline can be summarized in the
following.

3.3.1 Self-Docking
To evaluate the ability
of the docking protocol to successfully replicate the crystallographic
binding mode, a self-docking benchmark was first performed.

3.3.2 Total Cross-Docking
Cross-docking
studies (inverse docking) were executed among the whole pool of IRE1
cytosolic structures available, to discriminate between the IRE1 structures
able to bind the majority number of the cocrystallized ligands and
those structures clearly unsuitable for virtual high-throughput screening
campaigns.

3.3.3 Normalized Values of
Docking Score as the
Ranking Method
To differentiate between the IRE1 structures,
a postdocking analysis in the form of a normalization or standardization
was performed.33 This allows us to measure
the specificity or promiscuity of each IRE1 structure with respect
to accommodation of the ligands in the active site pocket. Evaluating
the ability of the overall IRE1 crystallographic protein structure
to host compounds could be valuable information to ameliorate future
VS campaigns.

3.3.4 Self- and Cross-Docking:
Rmsd Analysis
Reproducing the bound conformation of a ligand
in its crystallographic
structure is one of the initial challenges in molecular docking studies.
Rmsd values between the best-scoring pose and the cocrystallized conformation
of the ligand were calculated and are visualized as a heat map in Figure 5A. Each column highlights
different IRE1 PDB structures, and each row represents the different
cocrystallized ligands.

Figure 5 (A) Self-docking and cross-docking results for
cocrystallized ligands
(Figure 2) with available
cocrystal and apo structures (Table 1; listed by PDB ID). Values shown are the rmsd (in
angstrom) of the best-scoring docked pose to the crystal structure
pose. The rmsds are highlighted using a colorimetric scale from blue
to red for values from 0 to 10 Å. The diagonal (in squares) represents
self-docking results. (B) Superposition of the predicted best-scoring

ones (tan). For each pose, rmsd is reported. *Dephosphorylated IRE1α
cocrystallized with KIRA.13 **KIRA cocrystallized
in the 4U6R PDB
structure.

Out of the eight small organic
molecules cocrystallized in the
different IRE1 structures, seven were used in these studies, as STU(8) cocrystallized in the 4YZC PDB structure was not able to attain
good poses that fit in the active site of 4Z7G, 4YZ9, and 4Z7H without clashes in structures. For the 4YZ9 PDB structure, no
valid poses were obtained after minimization, indicating poor fit
for the ligand in the active site. For the 4Z7H and 4Z7G structures, all poses were rejected during
postdocking minimization.

The results are excellent, with rmsd
values <1.5 Å, validating
the accuracy of the software in reproducing the pose of the cocrystallized
ligands (Figure 5A,B).
Understandably, there are three exceptions; ADP cocrystallized in 2RIO, 4PL4, and 4PL5 all of which show
higher rmsd values. For the 4PL4 and 4PL5 structures, cocrystallized ADP is characterized by having high B-factor values, whereas the result for 2RIO can be ascribed
to the general flexibility of the ADP molecule. Our computational
workflow was designed to identify a unique pose (conformational state)
per compound. Evaluating a larger number of poses by visual inspection
may be a good strategy to cherry-pick the pose closest to the experimental
one but does not allow for automatization and predictability.

Moreover, that different ligand conformations and orientations
are possible in the kinase active site is clearly evident from the
ligands 3E4 (7) and 4K7 (5) cocrystallized
in the 4U6R and 4YZ9 PDB structures,
respectively (Figure S9). As expected,
reproduction of these two conformations using a protein structure
from a complex containing a different ligand could be challenging
(Figure 5A). This is
clearly evident by the high rmsd values when these two ligands were
docked in different IRE1 structures (Figure 5A).

In addition, using the apo structures
generated high rmsd values
in the docked ligand poses compared to the cocrystallized ligand conformations
(Figure 5A). The data
support the general findings that reproducing correct ligand native
conformation using apo structures, where no native ligand has been
cocrystallized, is generally worse compared to using holo structures.34

3.3.5 MASC Score Analysis
The second
step was to assess the performance of the docking program in ranking
the series of cocrystallized ligands toward the full pool of IRE1
crystal structures. Docking score analysis can be problematic if several
cocrystallized ligands score well against the full pool of protein
structures, as is the case herein (Figure S10). Except for the KIRA ligand, the ranking of the other cocrystallized
ligands proved difficult as highlighted by essentially the same docking
score value throughout the different IRE1 crystallographic structures
(Figure S10). In order to resolve this
problem, we used MASC scoring.33 The MASC
score is a useful tool, as it incorporates signed information describing
how far a value is from the average and in which direction.35 In our studies, the more negative the MASC score,
the more unique is the accommodation of a specific ligand in a specific
structure, whereas a large set with similar (near-zero) values indicates
promiscuity (either among ligands or among possible binding partners
for a specific ligand).

Despite the fact that no direct binding
experiments are available to compare the cross-docking results (only
IC50 values are reported11,13), the data
obtained are very encouraging in ranking these series of ligands cocrystallized
in different IRE1 structures. Ligands docked into their respective
cocrystallized structures were correctly ranked with better scores
compared to other ligands docked in that same structure (Figure 6A). For ADP, the
best binding targets stand out to be 2RIO, 3LJ0, 3P23, 4PL5, and 4YZD, which all represent structures with
ADP cocrystallized. This is clearly relevant and encouraging information
for successful VS studies.

In addition, multiple IRE1 crystallographic structures score
well
for a couple of compounds. For instance, the ligand APJ (2) cocrystallized in 3SDJ and 3FBV scores
very well against the yeast IRE1 structures that did not contain ADP
in the kinase active site, whereas their binding in the murine/human
IRE1 is worse. An explanation for the poor score against the IRE1
structures of other organisms can be seen in the noted differences
in sequence and in residues contributing to the favorable interaction
of ligands in the yeast versus human and murine IRE1. A screening
campaign using yeast IRE1 will hence not render the compounds best
suited for targeting the human analogue, despite the highly conserved
nature of the protein. Other interesting information was obtained
from investigating the heat map of the apo structures 5HGI and 4Z7G (Figure 6A). Both of them show MASC
values close to zero for all ligands, indicating promiscuity. In a
VS campaign, this could generate misleading results because these
two structures could enrich the population of false positives. Finally,
it is important to note that these docking simulations characterize
the PDB structure 4U6R as the better one to accommodate a subset of
ATP-competitive ligands (KIRAs13) that
allosterically inactivate the RNase domain through binding to the
kinase domain.

In order to confirm the PDB structure 4U6R as the best model
to accommodate this
type of KIRA allosteric inactivators, 25 KIRA compounds13 shown in Table S1 were docked into each of the 18 IRE1 crystallographic active sites.
The MASC score and docking score results are shown in Figures 6B and S10, respectively.

All KIRAs were found to score well
in the 4U6R structure
(Figure 6B). This can
be understood
from the fact that the allosteric action of the KIRAs involves a structural
distortion in the active site, moving helix-αC to in turn affect
dimer formation. Understandably, the docking score and MASC score
identified the ligand cocrystallized in 4U6R as the best ligand for its cognate active
site (i.e., higher docking score and larger negative MASC score).

Unexpectedly, the 3FBV PDB structure revealed a negative MASC score for several of the
KIRA compounds studied. The results could be rationalized by visual
inspection of the docked poses, showing that this structure establishes
favorable interactions from amino acids Leu680, Val689, Lys702, and
Asp754 (corresponding to Leu577, Val586, Lys599, and Asp651 in human),
relevant for the correct accommodation of KIRA-like compounds.

Furthermore, the PDB structures 4Z7G, 3P23, and 4YZD perform worse against a large set of
KIRA compounds. From visual inspection of the docking poses, several
steric clashes were identified explaining the low docking scores. 4Z7G is the apo structure
of hIRE1 and again highlights the importance of using a holo structure
for docking. 3P23 and 4YZD were
both cocrystallized with ADP, emphasizing the plasticity of the active
site pocket (Figure 4). Interestingly, one KIRA compound (KIRA analogue 20) binds very
selectively to the apo structure 5HGI. Only in the 5HGI structure, the compound is able to attain
a binding pose such that it can establish a favorable interaction
with Leu577, Val586, Lys599, and Leu695, validating that these amino
acids are crucial for the correct accommodation of KIRA-like compounds
inside the IRE1 kinase active site.

Comparing the docking scores
and MASC scores to the reported IC50 values for kinase
and RNase activity (Table S1), we conclude
that there is no specific pattern identified
that singles out strong binders as strong effectors in the current
work. This can be explained by several factors: the small range of
experimental values (i.e., 0.1–20 μM), absence of explicit
dissociation constant (Kd) values, and
the inherent limitations and approximations of docking methods.36,37

4 Conclusions and Perspective
In the present study, we have tried to address fundamental questions
related to docking, accuracy in reproducing ligand poses in the crystal
structures, and importance of appropriate protein conformations in
reproducing ligand poses. We have investigated a series of small organic
molecules cocrystallized in the IRE1 kinase active site and validated
the importance of molecular docking approaches for identifying novel
IRE1 modulators. The performance of the docking algorithm and MASC
score to rank compounds in a VS campaign was evaluated, and we conclude
that the application of a combined procedure that takes into consideration
self-docking and cross-docking studies will raise the chance of successful
VS studies.

The Glide docking program performed well. The poses
of cocrystallized
ligands were reproduced in almost all cases. In some cross-docking
cases, we saw high variability in docking results to a target receptor
structure (i.e., lack of consistency between the MASC score and rmsd
analysis). When non-native ligands are docked in these crystal structures,
there is a high chance of retrieving false positives. Cross-docking
the ligand set to the apo structures (PDB codes: 5HGI and 4Z7G) resulted in high
rmsd values. The apo structures are thus not suitable for VS studies.

The current study identified the holo receptor conformation of
the PDB code 4U6R as highly suitable for docking-based VS aiming to identify novel
KIRA-like compounds capable of allosterically inhibiting the RNase
activity. KIRA induces a conformational change upon binding,13 which explains the difference in selectivity
for this particular structure.

In addition, we have compared
and determined the most important
interactions of the ligands cocrystallized into the kinase active
site of hIRE1, opening the possibility for a rational VS approach.
Key residues involved in the binding of small organic molecules in
the IRE1 kinase active site were identified. In agreement with experimental
results,8 the sequence similarity and 3D
comparison between different species and interaction energy fingerprint
analysis highlight the importance of Lys599 for correct ligand binding.
In addition, from the cocrystallized structures numbered as per hIRE1
PDB codes (Table 1),
Leu577, Val586, and Leu695 were predicted to stabilize ligand binding
by hydrophobic interactions. These key residues, involved in strong
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with almost all cocrystallized
ligands, could be exploited as filtering tools during a VS campaign.
Postprocessing the VS results by filtering toward the presence or
absence of these favorable interactions could further enhance the
detection of putative binders. The methodology employed in this study
can be adapted to any protein for studying selectivity and choosing
the right starting structure for VS. All information acquired from
this study is currently being applied by our research groups to understand
the detailed molecular interactions required for selective IRE1α
inhibition. This knowledge coupled with relevant biochemical assays
can be directly applicable for developing new modulators of hIRE1α.
