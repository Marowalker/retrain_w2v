Interaction of H2O, H2S, H2Se,
NH3, PH3, and AsH3 with cations H+, CH3+, Cu+, Al+, Li+, Na+, and K+ was studied from
the energetic and structural viewpoint using B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method.
The charge transfer from the Lewis bases to the cations reduces lone
pair/lone pair (LP/LP) repulsion in H2O, H2S,
and H2Se and LP/bond pair (LP/BP) repulsion in NH3, PH3, and AsH3. In parallel, changes in the
H–M–H angles (M = O, S, Se, N, P, and As) are observed.
The change in the H–M–H angle during the interactions
was proportional to the amount of charge transferred from the bases
to the cations and electron density (ρ) at the molecule/cation
bond critical point. Also, the opposite trend for proton affinities
of these two families, that is, NH3 > PH3 >
AsH3 and H2O < H2S < H2Se, was interpreted on the basis of LP/BP repulsion in their
neutral and protonated forms. Interaction of the Lewis bases with
neutral Lewis acids including BeH2, BeF2, and
BH3 was studied energetically and structurally. The calculated
energies for interactions of H2O and NH3 with
BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 are larger than
the corresponding values for H2S, H2Se, PH3, and AsH3. This difference was interpreted on
the basis of the lower stability of H2O and NH3 because of large LP/LP and LP/BP repulsion in H2O and
LP/BP repulsion in NH3.

1 Introduction
There
are many models and theories which attempt to predict the
geometry of the molecules and complexes.1 Lewis dot diagrams are the simplest molecular structures explained
on the basis of the octet rule.2 Hybridization,3 valence bond theory,4 nonbonded interaction,5 and valence-shell
electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR)6−8 are further models giving a more
realistic geometry as compared to Lewis structures. The VSEPR model
is used to determine approximate structure of a molecule basis on
the number of electron pairs of the central atom. Because the lone
pair (LP) electrons are affected by one nucleus, whereas the bond
pair (BP) electrons are influenced by two nuclei, the former occupy
larger place.6 Because of the repulsive
force between the LPs, they tend to arrange in a way to minimize the
repulsion. It has been established that the repulsion trend is as
LP/LP > LP/BP > BP/BP.6

Many
researchers have attempted to interpret the VSEPR model on
the basis of physical concepts,9−11 whereas others criticized this
model.12,13 However, this model has been used for elucidation
or prediction of many structures. Although the effect of LP repulsion
on the structures of neutral and charged molecules and complexes has
been considered,14−17 this repulsion effect on the cation/molecule interactions has not
been studied from the energetic point of view.

Cation affinity
(CA) of a molecule is defined as −ΔH of attachment of a cation to the molecule.18 Although it is expected that the empty orbital
of cations accepts the LP electrons of molecules to form a bond via
covalent interactions, complete electron transfer depends essentially
on polarizability and dipole moment of the molecules,19 electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and electron-donating
group (EDG),20 nature of the cation or
acceptor atom, direction of cation/molecule interaction,21 electron affinity of the cation, and so on.
Therefore, the cation attachment may occur through various combinations
of covalent and electrostatic (charge/dipole) interaction.22,23 It is known that larger alkali metal cations (Na+, K+) attach to Lewis bases mainly via electrostatic interactions,
whereas H+, CH3+, and to some extent
Cu+ interact covalently.19,24 Li+ and Al+ exhibit intermediate behaviors with comparable
electrostatic and covalent contributions. Effects of polarizability,
dipole moment, and EWG and EDG on CA have been extensively studied.
In this work, effect of LP and BP repulsions on the cation/molecule
interaction is investigated from an energetic point of view. For comparison,
interactions of neutral Lewis acids BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 with H2O, H2S, H2Se, NH3, PH3, and AsH3 are studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Interaction of the Lewis
Bases with Cations
The B3LYP and CBS-Q calculated CAs of
H2O, H2S, H2Se, NH3, PH3, and AsH3 are summarized in Table 1. There is an agreement between the calculated
and experimental
data; however, CBS-Q underestimates the Cu+ affinities.
The proton affinities (PAs) of H2O, H2S, and
H2Se increase as H2O < H2S <
H2Se, whereas for NH3, PH3, and AsH3, the PA trend is as NH3 > PH3 >
AsH3. The dipole moments (μ) of H2O, H2S, and H2Se are 1.85, 0.97, and 0.24 debye (D),
respectively
(Table S1 in Supporting Information), a
trend opposite to their PAs. The reason is that H+ interacts
with the Lewis bases mainly through covalent interaction, and the
electrostatic contribution (ion/dipole interaction) is small. The
PAs of H2O, H2S, and H2Se and their
polarizabilities (α) display the same trend (Table S1) which somewhat confirms the covalent nature of their
interactions with H+. We intended to use electron densities
(ρ) at bond critical points (BCPs) of O–H, S–H,
and Se–H in H3O+, H3S+, and H3Se+ to compare the covalency
nature of the bonds; however, because ρ also depends on bond
length and atom type, it is not a good index of covalency. For example,
the calculated values of ρ at BCPs of O–H, S–H,
and Se–H in H3O+, H3S+, and H3Se+ are 0.33, 0.22, and 0.17,
respectively (Table S2) which is not in
agreement with the hypothetical covalent nature of the interactions.
Therefore, Mulliken charge distributions for H3O+, H3S+, and H3Se+ were
obtained to investigate the covalency of the bonds on the basis of
the extent of transferred charge from the molecules to the H+ (Figure S1). Comparison of the transferred
charges shows that the covalency trend is as Se–H > S–H
> OH which are in agreement with the PA trend. Therefore, charge
transfer,
electrostatic interaction, and polarizability influence the PA and
generally CA. Effects of these parameters have been investigated by
several authors.19−23 We advocate here that the LP repulsion may influence the CAs and
can be used to explain the observed CA trend. Comparison of the angle
between LP and BP vectors in H3O+ (105.0°),
H3S+ (121.9°), and H3Se+ (123.4°) in Figure 1 shows that the LP/BP repulsion in H3O+ is larger than that in H3S+ and H3Se+; therefore, the latter is more stable.

On the other
hand, the trend in PA of NH3, PH3, and AsH3 is the same as their dipole moments (Table S1). Therefore, the simple interpretation
of an electrostatic interaction would be in contradiction with the
covalent bonding of the proton.

Comparison of the LP/BP angles
in Figure 1 shows that
NH3 with H–N-LP
angle of 111.0° suffers from the LP/BP repulsion more than PH3 and AsH3 with angles of 122.7° and 123.7°,
respectively (smaller molecules suffer from more LP repulsions5). Protonation of NH3, PH3, and AsH3 removes completely the LP repulsion (angles
= 109.5°), which results in stabilization of the protonated molecules,
and this stabilization is larger for NH3 than for PH3 and AsH3. Therefore, the PA of NH3 is
larger than the other two and the PA trend, NH3 > PH3 > AsH3, is in agreement with the trend in LP
repulsions.

In the case of H2O, H2S, and
H2Se, both the neutral and protonated molecules suffer
from LP/BP repulsion,
whereas the neutral ones also experience LP/LP repulsion. Because
the loss of stability due to LP/LP repulsion is larger than that due
to LP/BP and BP/BP repulsions, we can assume that the loss of stability
due to LP/LP repulsion in the neutral molecule is comparable, and
what controls the stability of the protonated molecules and consequently
the PA trends is LP/BP repulsion in the protonated molecules.

In summary, because the repulsion effects in (H3O+, H3S+, and H3Se+) and (NH3, PH3, and AsH3) are similar,
for NH3, PH3, and AsH3, the LP/BP
repulsion in the neutral molecules controls the PA trend, whereas
in the case of H2O, H2S, and H2Se,
the LP/BP repulsion in the protonated structures influences the PA
trend. Although we can find several justifications in literature as
to why PA of N site is larger than that of O site,31,32 it seems that the effect of LP repulsion has been ignored. Protonation
of a nitrogen site completely removes the LP repulsion, whereas in
the case of oxygen sites, only the LP/LP repulsion is diminished after
protonation and LP/BP remains. However, we cannot always use LP repulsion
to interpret the PA trend. For example, a recent study on the simple
pnictogen oxides shows that the PA of the oxygen atom in these compounds
increases as As–O > N–O > P–O.33

Interactions of the other cations including
CH3+, Cu+, Al+, Li+, Na+, and K+ with H2O, H2S, H2Se, NH3, PH3, and AsH3 were also
investigated. Figure 2 shows the optimized structures of the adduct cations as well as
their angles and bond lengths. Previous studies show that the tendency
of the cations to interact covalently with the molecules decreases
as H+ > CH3+ > Cu+ > Al+ ≈ Li+ > Na+ >
K+.19,26,28 In the covalent interactions,
an empty orbital of the cation (Lewis acid) accommodates the LP electron
of the Lewis base, and the LP/BP repulsion is reduced. On the other
hand, in highly electrostatic interactions, the charge/dipole dominates
and a large part of the LP repulsion remains operative. Therefore,
change in the H–M–H (M = O, S, Se, N, P, and As) angle
upon cationization may be used as a marker of the nature of the interaction.
For example, the H–O–H angle in H2O is about
105.1°, whereas this angle in H2O–H+, H2O–Na+, and H2O–K+ is 113.5°, 105.1°, and 104.6° respectively.
These changes in the angles indicate that the H+ interacts
covalently with H2O and reduces LP repulsion, whereas the
highly electrostatic interactions of Na+ and K+ with H2O do not reduce significantly the LP repulsion.
Also, Na+ and K+ are aligned with the direction
of the dipole moment of H2O (planar structure of adduct
ions), whereas H3O+ has a pyramidal structure.15 Therefore, the structure of the H2O–X+ adduct ions may be used as a measure of the
nature of the H2O–X+ interactions so
that planar structures correspond to the electrostatic interaction,
and pyramidal geometries indicate more covalency. However, this is
not a general index, and it is established only for H2O
adduct ions because all of the H2S–X+ and H2Se–X+ form pyramidal adduct ions.
It should be mentioned that the H–O–H angle in H2O–K+ is slightly smaller than that in H2O, which may be because of large size of K+ and
increased LP/BP repulsion. Because electron density (ρ) at BCP
of M–X (X = cation) is another good index of covalency, it
is expected that there is a relationship between the H–M–H
angle in the adduct ions and ρ. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the change in the H–M–H
angles of the adduct ions versus the electron density (ρ) and
the amount of the transferred charge. As the electron density and
transferred charge (covalent contribution) increase, the H–M–H
angle becomes wider. Also, Figure S1 shows
the widening of this angle as a function of the increase of the transferred
charge from the Lewis base to the cation. In the case of H2O, the angle-ρ relationship is not completely linear because
although more covalent interactions reduce LP/LP repulsion, these
strong interactions lead in shorter cation/molecule bond lengths and
increased LP/BP and BP/BP repulsions.5 However,
the general trend is that covalent interactions with more charge transfer
results in relief of the LP repulsion.

2.2 Effect of BP/BP and LP/BP Repulsions in NHn(CH3)3–n, PHn(CH3)3–n, (CH3)2–nHnO, and (CH3)2–nHnS
The effect
of methyl groups on the PAs of simple amines, ethers, and alcohols
has been previously studied.19,34 These studies showed
that methyl group increases the PAs of the compounds; however, this
increase is not linear (Figure 3). The observed curvature in the graph of PA versus the number
of CH3 (n) group has been attributed to
several physical and structural parameters such as saturation and
electrostatic interaction.19 In our previous
work, we showed that the graphs are fitted by a quadratic function19 1  where, A, B, and C are constants. The calculated PAs of the
methylated Lewis bases have been collected in Table S3. Comparison of the PA versus n graphs
of amines and phosphines (Figure 3a) or ethers and thioethers (Figure 3b) reveals that the curvature for the amines
and ethers with smaller central atoms (N and O) are larger. The constant
C, which stands for the curvature, is small for phosphines and thioethers
and large for amines and ethers. Because there is a relationship between
the curvature and the size of the acceptor atom, the curvature may
be attributed to LP repulsion. Figure S2 compares the geometrical parameters of N(CH3)3, P(CH3)3, (CH3)2O, and
(CH3)2S with their protonated forms. The CH3–N–CH3 and CH3–P–CH3 angles in the neutral molecules are 111.7 and 99.4°,
respectively. After protonation, the CH3–P–CH3 angle increases to 111.3°, whereas the CH3–N–CH3 angle remains constant. In other
words, P(CH3)3 gets rid of CH3/CH3 (BP/BP) repulsion because of protonation, whereas protonation
does not decrease CH3/CH3 repulsion in N(CH3)3. Therefore, the graph slope of PA versus the
number of CH3 groups is larger for the methyl phosphines.
In the case of (CH3)2O and (CH3)2S, the change in the CH3–O–CH3 and CH3–S–CH3 angles
after protonation is comparable; however, the CH3/LP repulsion
in (CH3)2S–H+ is smaller (compare
the angles between LP and CH3 in Figure S2).

2.3 Interaction
between Lewis Bases and Neutral
Lewis Acids
Lewis acids relieve LP/BP and LP/LP repulsion
in the Lewis bases by withdrawing their electron pairs. In the previous
section, the interaction of cations with the Lewis bases was investigated,
and in this section, interactions of the Lewis bases with some neutral
Lewis acids are studied. Because of their electron deficiency, the
boron atom in BX3 and the beryllium atom in BeX2 are electron-acceptor centers, therefore, BH3, BeH2, and BeF2 are known as neutral Lewis acids.35−40 BF3 is also a neutral Lewis acid; however, it was not
considered here because we could not fully optimize some adducts due
to strong interaction between F atom of BF3 and H atoms
of the Lewis bases H2O, H2S, H2Se,
and AsH3.

The net dipole moments of isolated BH3, BeH2, and BeF2 are zero; however,
BeX2 becomes bent and BH3 pyramidal when coordinated;
therefore, their interactions are slightly electrostatic. Figure 4 shows the optimized
structures for interaction of BeH2, BeF2, and
BH3 with H2O, H2S, H2Se,
NH3, PH3, and AsH3. Because the H–H
distance in the Lewis bases is directly proportional to BP/BP repulsion,5 these distances are also shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Optimized structure for
interaction of BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 with H2O, H2S,
H2Se, NH3, PH3, and AsH3. The angles and bond lengths are in degree and Angstrom, respectively.

The calculated enthalpies and
Gibbs free energies for the interactions
of BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 with H2O, H2S, H2Se, NH3, PH3, and AsH3 are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, the calculated enthalpies
for interaction of H2O and NH3 with BeH2 and BeF2 are about 3–4 times larger than
the corresponding values for H2S, H2Se, PH3, and AsH3. This observation may be interpreted
considering the large LP/LP and LP/BP repulsion in H2O
and LP/BP repulsion in NH3. Because of the small size of
N and O atoms, the LP/LP and LP/BP repulsions in H2O and
NH3 are larger than H2S, H2Se, PH3, and AsH3 with larger central atoms. When H2O and NH3 interact with BeH2 and BeF2, donation of their electron pairs to an empty orbital of
Be relieves the LP/LP repulsion, and a larger stabilization is achieved
than for H2S, H2Se, PH3, and AsH3 adducts. We interpreted the strong interaction between NH3 and BeH2 basis on decrease in LP/BP; however,
the change in the H–N–H angle before and after interaction
is not considerable. The strong interaction results in a short distance
between NH3 and BeH2, which increases the repulsion
between BeH2 and N–H BP. In other words, although
the BeH2 captures the LP electrons of NH3 and
reduces LP/BP reduction, it substitutes the electrons and inserts
a new type of repulsion. The amount of transferred charge from Lewis
bases to BeH2 and BeF2 can confirm this hypothesis
(Table 2). Although
H2O and NH3 are less polarizable (Table S1) than H2S, H2Se,
PH3, and AsH3, their transferred charges to
BeH2 and BeF2 are larger. In addition to polarizability,
the relief of LP repulsion is another factor that influences the amount
of charge transfer.

a The charge on the Lewis bases in
the complexes (q) was computed using Mulliken and
MK charge distribution.

from ref (42).

The large interaction energies of
H2O and NH3 with BeH2 and BeF2 may be attributed in part
to the large dipole moments of H2O and NH3 (Table S1) rather than the LP repulsion. To explore
the effect of dipole moment, interaction between (CH3)2O, (CH3)2S, (CH3)2Se, N(CH3)3, P(CH3)3,
and As(CH3)3 and BeH2 and BeF2 was studied. Although the dipole moments of (CH3)2O and N(CH3)3 are smaller than
those of (CH3)2S, (CH3)2Se, P(CH3)3, and As(CH3)3 (Table S1), their interaction energies
with BeH2 and BeF2 are larger (Table 2). In other words, the polarizability
(α), dipole moment (μ), and transferred charge (q) trends are as (CH3)2Se > (CH3)2S > (CH3)2O, (CH3)2S > (CH3)2Se > (CH3)2O, and (CH3)2S > (CH3)2Se > (CH3)2O, respectively,
whereas
the interaction energy trend is as (CH3)2O >
(CH3)2S > (CH3)2Se.
These
trends suggest that other factor(s) must be employed. Another effect
strongly opposed to the three others is seemingly LP repulsion. Also,
the difference between the interaction energies of the simple bases
are larger than that for the methylated bases. The smaller difference
in the interaction energies of the methylated Lewis bases may be attributed
to smaller difference between LP/LP and LP/BP repulsions (Figure S3). For example, H2Se has
a larger space to accommodate the two LP electrons compared to H2O; therefore, the LP/LP repulsion in H2O is larger
than that in H2Se. On the other hand, because of CH3/CH3 repulsion in the both (CH3)2O and (CH3)2Se, there is not enough
space for the LP electrons, and consequently their LP/LP repulsion
is comparable in (CH3)2O and (CH3)2Se. In addition, in the methylated systems, the repulsive
interaction between CH3 group and BeH2, for
example, is considerable, and a determining factor for the H/BeH2 repulsive interaction in the simple base is not noticeable,
and other factors influence the interaction energies. The short distance
between N(CH3)3 and BeH2, because
of their strong interaction, results in a large repulsion between
BeH2 and methyl groups. Therefore, the C–N–C
angle in BeH2–N(CH3)3 complex
is slightly smaller than that in isolated N(CH3)3.

Interaction of BH3 with H2O, NH3, H2S, and H2Se does not lead in considerable
change in the H–M–H angles, whereas it changes the H–P–H
and H–As–H angles. Interaction of H2O with
BeH2 is about 30 kJ/mol stronger than its interaction with
BH3. This difference may not be attributed solely to the
larger tendency of BeH2 to accept an electron pair of the
oxygen atom and reduction of LP repulsion because the Mulliken charge
distribution shows that the amount of transferred charge in the case
of BeH2 and BH3 interactions are not so different
(Table 2). Hence, this
difference in the interaction energies may be interpreted on the basis
of the electrostatic interaction. Mo and Gao41 showed that the Lewis base/Lewis acid interactions with interaction
energies between 12 and 38 kJ/mol are mainly electrostatic. Therefore,
we calculated the dipole moments of BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 molecules in their complexes (Table S4). The dipole moments of BeH2 and BeF2 with bent geometry and pyramidal BH3 are about
1.5, 2.0, and 0.5 D, respectively. Comparison of the dipole moments
shows that the electrostatic contributions to BeH2 and
BeF2 interactions are about 3 and 4 times stronger than
that for BH3. Because of small dipole moments of PH3 and AsH3 (0.55 and 0.2 D, respectively), their
large interaction energies with BH3 (76.4 and 50.8 kJ/mol,
respectively) may not only be because of electrostatic contribution.
Furthermore, both Merz-Kollman (MK) and Mulliken charge analyses show
large amount of transferred charge in the PH3/BH3 and AsH3/BH3 complexes. This nonelectrostatic
interaction materializes as considerable changes in the H–P–H
and H–As–H angles because of complexation with BH3 (Figure 4).

3 Conclusions
Interactions of NH3, PH3, AsH3, H2O, H2S,
and H2Se with some typical
singly charged cations (H+, CH3+,
Cu+, Li+, Na+, K+, and
Al+) and neutral Lewis acids (BeH2, BeF2, and BH3) were (re)examined from the viewpoint
of the internal repulsion between electron pairs. The bases H2O, H2S, and H2Se suffer from both LP/LP
and LP/BP repulsions, whereas NH3, PH3, and
AsH3 experience only LP/BP repulsion. Because of the donor/acceptor
interaction, the LP electrons of the base are in part localized in
an empty orbital of the Lewis acid, leading in reducing the LP repulsion
and change in the H–M–H angles (M = N, P, As, O, S,
and Se). However, because the charge transfer is not complete and
it is different for different bases and cations, the change in the
H–M–H angles is different. Therefore, changes in the
H–M–H angle because of the interaction can be used to
interpret the nature of the interaction, that is, charge transfer
or covalency of the interaction. However, there is not a straightforward
relationship between angle change and transferred charge, for example,
because many factors influence these interactions. Namely, CA of a
molecule is multifactorial, involving essentially polarizability (α)
and dipole moment (μ) of the molecule, electron affinity of
the cation, EWG and EDG connected to the cation-acceptor site, and
orientation of the cation relative to the molecule. The influence
of these factors on the CA has been extensively investigated. In this
work, we observed that in some cases the CAs cannot be interpreted
on the sole basis of these factors, and LP repulsion should also be
considered. In other words, change in LP repulsion in a molecule during
its interaction with a cation becomes significant as regards to other
factors. In summary, LP repulsion affects CA and can be used for interpreting
observed trends in CA. Interaction of the Lewis bases with BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 was studied energetically
and structurally. H2O and NH3 interact with
BeH2, BeF2, and BH3 more strongly
compared to PH3, AsH3, H2S, and H2Se. The difference in the interaction energies was attributed
to the larger relief of LP repulsion in H2O and NH3 after interaction with BeH2 and BeF2, and BH3.

4 Computational Details
Structures of all molecules and complexes were fully optimized
employing density functional theory using the B3LYP functional in
the gas phase. The 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used for all calculations
which includes diffuse and polarization functions for both hydrogen
and heavy atoms. Frequency calculations were performed at the same
level of theory and at 298.15 K to obtain thermodynamic quantities
of Lewis base/Lewis acid interactions such as ΔH and ΔG. Accuracy of the B3LYP method for
the ion/molecule systems has been confirmed previously.43 For the systems including ions, B3LYP with affordable
basis sets exhibits better performance compared to X3LYP, M06-2X,
and M06-L methods.44 For more comparison,
CAs and cation basicities (CBs) were also computed using a complete
basis set method, CBS-Q.45 MK and Mulliken
charge distributions were used to compute the transferred charge from
the Lewis bases to the Lewis acids. The van der Waals radii of As
and Se atoms, 1.85 and 1.90 Å, respectively, were used in the
MK charge calculations. All calculations were performed using Gaussian
09 software.46 The atom in molecule (AIM)
calculations were carried out using AIM2000 software47 to determine the electron density, ρ, and its Laplacian,
−∇2ρ at BCPs.

CA of a molecule
(M) is calculated as −ΔH of reaction 2 2  where X+ is the cation.
The −ΔG of reaction 2 is reported as CB of M.
