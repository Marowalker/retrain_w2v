In this work, subair injection was
proposed to improve the combustibility
and NOx emission in a 500 MW tangentially fired coal boiler. The location
of injection ports was determined based on the coal particle trajectory
and its effect was investigated numerically. The flow rate of subair
was set to 0, 5, and 10% of the total combustion air. The secondary
air flow rate was decreased appropriately to ensure that the total
quantity of combustion air remained constant. The over-fire air was
not adjusted to retain the effect of an air-staged combustion. The
simulation results showed that the subair improved the combustibility
of coal particles originating from burners A and B in the lower part
of the furnace. Particles from other burners were not affected significantly.
In addition, this method achieved reduction of NOx by 6.3 and 13.2%
when the subair accounted for 5 and 10% of the combustion air, respectively.
This reduction was attributed to the decrease in the peak temperature
as a result of a wider combustion region. The proposed subair technique
improved the coal combustibility and reduced the NOx emissions successfully
in the furnace.

1 Introduction
In South Korea, thermal
coal-fueled power generation is the second
most utilized method of generating electricity right after nuclear
power. In fact, this important and relatively cheap power source represents
more than 38% of the annual energy production in South Korea.1 Nevertheless, power plants utilizing pulverized
coal as the fuel are often regarded as one of the major sources of
nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution.2 Countries
around the world have already started to focus on issues of emissions
reduction, which is an important way to reach the environmental objectives.3−5 Therefore, the acceptable limits for the emission of these oxides
are increasingly tightening all around the world. NOx emissions are
known to contribute to global warming, acid rain, and photochemical
smog formation, and they also pose a risk to human health.6,7 NOx emission can be controlled by the reaction of these oxides with
ammonia through a selective catalytic reduction process, whose efficiency
is sufficiently high to meet the regulation limits. However, the cost
of ammonia consumption required to counteract the NOx pollution is
directly related to the maintenance costs for this method of power
generation. In contrast to sulfur oxide emissions, the NOx emissions
from boilers can be reduced significantly by the modification of the
combustion process.8,9 To date, several technologies
directed at reducing NOx emissions such as air-staged combustion,
reburning by gas fuel injection, and low-NOx burners have been studied
and applied widely.

Tangentially fired coal boiler is one of
the most commonly employed
boilers in South Korea, as tangential combustion can guarantee stable
combustion, wide coal adaptability, and efficient air staging for
the control of NOx emissions.10,11 This boiler, which
is the subject of this work, employs a separated over-fire air (SOFA)
to generate air-staged combustion. The staged combustion consists
of a primary oxygen-lean combustion zone and a secondary combustion
zone where the fuel burnout is completed by over-fire air. The NOx
emissions arising from the nitrogen-containing fuel in this setup
can be decreased by lowering the peak temperature in the primary zone.12,13 Air staging (i.e., a two-stage combustion process) employing over-fire
air is a fairly efficient method for reducing the NOx emission. However,
such a reduction is usually in conflict with the complete combustion
and can pose a risk of increased unburned carbon content in fly ash.14 Power plants in South Korea have expanded the
range of coal employed as fuel and coals with poor reactivity can
increase the content of unburned carbon despite other advantages of
tangentially fired coal boilers. Therefore, it is essential to not
only reduce NOx emissions but also to improve the burnout of coal
particles in the furnace. To this end, researches have been conducted
introduction of adjustments to the parameters under which coal boilers
operate to optimize their performance.15−22 Furthermore, Sun et al.23 introduced
the concept of horizontal bias combustion technology, which was developed
to solve the problems of combustion efficiency, flame stabilization,
slagging, corrosion, and NOx emissions. An horizontal bias combustion
burner divides the primary air (PA) stream into two substreams, each
with a different air–fuel ratio, which form a fuel-rich/fuel-lean
region horizontally.24 Chen et al.25,26 reported the combustion characteristics and NOx emission for a down-fired
boiler retrofitted with a new combustion system. This system involved
the introduction of an over-fire air and a decrease in the flow areas
of the inner and outer secondary air (SA) ducts of swirl burners.
Using this system in industrial experiments, the authors demonstrated
a significant reduction in NOx emission without increasing the content
of unburned carbon in fly ash.

The numerical analysis performed
herein aims to improve further
the technology currently available for controlling NOx emissions by
the supply of subair through ports located at the boiler bottom and,
in particular, by reducing the burnout problem. This attempt is similar
to the under-fire air (UFA) system, whose effect on the combustion
efficiency was evaluated by Filkoski et al.27 With the implementation of UFA inlet ports in the lower part of
the furnace, additional swirls are created near the burner regions,
and the combustion efficiency improved as UFA flow rate was increased.
However, the combustion chamber of the boiler was not a tangential
firing system which is discussed in this work, and the effect on the
NOx formation was not treated.

In numerical work on tangentially
fired coal boilers, some of the
coal particles supplied from burners A and B (lower burners) first
move to the bottom of the boiler, which is followed by their movement
to the upper furnace.28,29 These particles have a longer
residence time than other particles supplied from burners C to E (upper
burners). Nevertheless, burnout can be delayed under such circumstances
as a result of oxygen deficiency in the inner swirling flow that particles
from burners A and B pass by. Herein, therefore, a fraction of combustion
air was supplied through the boiler throat to increase the concentration
of oxygen in the bottom zone. A continuous burnout from the bottom
burners is expected to decrease the rate of NOx formation by reducing
the peak temperature. To examine this hypothesis, a numerical analysis
implemented using a commercial code (ANSYS Fluent 16.1) is performed,
with a particular focus on evaluating the effect of air supply from
the bottom in terms of coal combustion characteristics and NOx formation.

2 Methods
2.1 Boiler Specifications and
Coal Properties
Figures 1 show schematic
representations of a 500 MW tangentially fired coal boiler examined
in this study. The boiler consists of a furnace, crossover pass, and
rear pass. Pulverized coal and air are supplied through all corners
of the furnace and the gas stream produces a swirling flow. As a result
of the intense rotational speed and the low-pressure region at the
center of the fireball in the furnace, the combustion particles and
gases are attracted to the center of the furnace.30 The burner incorporates a primary air (PA) and secondary
air (SA) that can be found in each of the six burner levels, A to
F. Burner F, however, was not used in this study. PA supplies pulverized
coal and air at a temperature of 340 K, whereas SA provides air at
a temperature of 593 K. The over-fire air (OFA) located at the top
of the furnace consists of two elements, namely, a close-coupled over-fire
air (CCOFA) and a separated over-fire air (SOFA), both of which facilitate
the combustion of unburned particles from the lower part of the furnace.
The use of SOFA turns the lower furnace into a fuel-rich environment
and contributes significantly to the reduction of NOx emissions. The
heat generated from the combustion in the furnace is delivered to
the water wall and tube bundles that consist of the superheater (SH),
reheater (RH), and economizer located in the crossover pass and the
rear pass. Some of the ash remaining after coal particles have burned
flows out via the ash hopper positioned at the bottom of the boiler,
whereas the fly ash moves through the heat-receiving part and comes
out through the boiler exit. In this work, bituminous coal, which
is commonly employed in thermal power plants, was selected as fuel.
The coal properties are described in Table 1.

The computational grid was made up of 6.6 million
hexahedral cells,
many of which were used to represent the furnace to allow a more precise
representation of the flow and combustion processes. To ensure the
independence of the results, a test was conducted using other grid
with 7.5 million cells. In the test, the gas temperature and x-velocity along the y-direction lines
(x = 0 m, y = −8 to 8 m, z at the burner A and the lowest SOFA level) were compared
(Figure 2). The variation
of the results was small; therefore, the grid with 6.6 million cells
was adopted to reduce computation cost.

2.2 Computational Models
The simulations
performed in this work implemented the realizable k−ε
model for turbulence. This model includes an alternative formulation
for the turbulent viscosity and a modified transport equation for
the dissipation rate. The realizable k−ε model was selected
in particular because it provides substantial improvements over the
standard k−ε model, where the flow features include strong
streamline curvature, vortices, and rotation.31

Radiation is a major form of heat transfer within the furnace.
Recently, various reports describing the incorporation of radiation
in furnace simulations have been introduced by Yin.32,33 In this work, the discrete ordinates (DO) model, offering satisfactory
results over a wide range of optical thicknesses, is used to represent
the particle and gas radiation. The DO model approximates the solution
of the radiative-transfer equation by discretizing the entire solid
angle into a finite number of solid angles. The weighted sum of gray
gases model was applied in gas emissivity calculations. The particle
emissivity of pulverized coal varies with the fraction of unburned
char.33 Calculations performed here, however,
employed the most commonly utilized emissivity constant of 0.9. The
particle scattering factor was set to 0.6—a value that is indicative
of forward scattering.34

For the
calculations of the reaction between homogeneous gaseous
volatiles, the finite-rate/eddy-dissipation (FR/ED) model was applied
using a simple two-step reaction mechanism that provides a reasonable
compromise between accuracy and computational cost. The FR/ED model
calculates both the reaction rates and the rate of production of species
through the turbulence–chemistry interactions. The net reaction
rate value was calculated using a minimum of two values of reaction
rates.

The volatile release was described using the two competing
rates
model (the Kobayashi model).35 In this
model, the competing rates control the devolatilization over both
low- and high-temperature ranges and the required kinetic parameters
were set to the default values. The kinetic/diffusion-limited model
was selected for the char combustion. The char reaction rate is determined
by both the diffusion of oxygen to the particle surface and the intrinsic
chemical reaction kinetics.36,37 The particle mass is
calculated as 1  where dp is the
particle diameter, PO2 is the
partial pressure of oxygen in the gas surrounding the particle, D0 is the bulk molecular diffusion rate, and k is the kinetic rate.

D0 and k can be calculated
as 2   3  where C1 is the
mass diffusion coefficient, Tp is the
particle temperature, Tg is the gas temperature, A is the pre-exponential factor, E is the
activation energy. The kinetic parameters of this model were obtained
from a pressurized wire mesh heating reactor in Pusan Clean Coal Center.
The pre-exponential factor is 0.0043 kg/(m2 Pa s) and the
activation energy is 8.37 × 107 J/kmol. The equipment
and experimental procedures employed are provided in reference.38

Since the NOx concentration in the flue
gas is very low, NOx formation
was determined by postprocessing after calculating the flow, temperature,
and gas species concentration fields. NOx formation was calculated
by taking into consideration both fuel and thermal NOx. Fuel NOx is
produced by the oxidation of the volatiles present in the coal and
the oxidation of the nitrogen present in the residual char. The mass
fractions of volatile N and char-N were set to 0.576 and 0.424, respectively,
which were predicted using the chemical percolation devolatilization
submodel.39 During the devolatilization
process, the two major precursors of NOx are HCN and NH3. In this work, the nitrogen in volatiles is emitted as HCN and NH3 in a ratio of 9:1 and the nitrogen in char is converted to
NO.15 The thermal NOx is formed from the
dissociation and oxidation of the nitrogen admitted to the furnace
with the combustion air. The mechanism of thermal NOx is described
by the extended Zeldovich mechanism as shown in reactions.40 4   5   6  A third reaction contributes to the formation
of thermal NOx, particularly at near-stoichiometric conditions and
in fuel-rich mixtures.

A more detailed description of the computational
models used can
be found in the literature.41,42

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Simulated Performance of
a Tangentially Fired
Coal Boiler Lacking Subair Ports
To assess the influence
of subair supply through the bottom section of the boiler, it was
first necessary to examine through simulations the performance of
a boiler lacking the extra ports. These simulations were performed
using values of flow rate, air temperature, and coal feed rate that
were based on the operating conditions typical for power plants in
South Korea. Under these conditions, the flow rate of PA, SA, and
OFA (CCOFA and SOFA) accounted respectively for about 24, 28, and
48% of the total combustion air and the excess air was 15%. The PA,
SA, and OFA temperatures were set to 340, 593, and 593 K, respectively.

The temperature and oxygen concentration at the boiler exit were
calculated as 604 K and 2.6%, respectively. The tube bundles exhibited
a unified trend in terms of heat absorption; despite minor disparities
between the individual components, the results displayed close correlation
with the values expected based on the design conditions (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Heat absorption by tube
bundles (superheater = SH, reheater = RH).

Based on the temperature distribution determined within the
furnace
(Figure 4), it was
observed that the high-temperature region formed a ring around the
low-temperature region located at the center. This phenomenon gives
rise to an ascending swirl flow of coal particles and air supplied
through the tangentially fired coal burner. The temperature measured
at burner E and lower SOFA was greater than that of burner A or upper
SOFA. Therefore, a considerable proportion of particles was combusted
in these regions, as nearly half of the total air within the boiler
is supplied by OFA located above burner E. Whereas a high concentration
of oxygen was observed near the coal burners located in the lower
part of the furnace, oxygen was virtually nonexistent in all other
parts of the boiler. This observation could be explained by the distribution
of combustion air—only half of coal particles were combusted
in the lower furnace where the coal burners were located. This, in
turn, created fuel-rich conditions that suppressed the production
of NOx. Additionally, the air supplied from SOFA system, located in
the upper section of the furnace, is used in the combustion of unburned
carbon particles rising from the lower part of the furnace. It should
be noted that the mass fraction of oxygen near the wall was found
to be relatively high. Figure 5 shows the particle trajectory, where completely combusted
particles are represented with transparent color for ease of comparison.

Figure 4 Temperature
and oxygen distribution in the boiler.

Figure 5 Particle trajectory determined for different burners, colored by
char mass fraction.

Figure 5 clearly
demonstrates that some coal particles from burners A and B fall initially
to the furnace bottom, where they concentrate at the center prior
to rising again. Despite their long residence time, these particles
undergo combustion at a lower rate, since the oxygen concentration
in their trajectory is extremely low. In contrast, the particles coming
from burners D and E exhibit shorter residence time—they do
not fall to the bottom of the furnace and, instead, they ascend via
a relatively wide swirling trajectory and exposed to high oxygen concentration
in the SOFA region near the wall, which causes these particles to
undergo rapid combustion. Thus, at a fixed OFA flow rate, the flow
rate of SA was diverted only into the ash hopper, where a large fraction
of particles from burners A and B were concentrated. Therefore, based
on these observations, it was predicted that the combustion could
be accelerated by the supply of air through ports located at the furnace
bottom.

3.2 Simulated Subair Supply at the Bottom of Furnace
Preliminary numerical analysis was conducted to select the most
appropriate method of supplying subair through the boiler throat.
In the dry bottom ash removal system, which is part of 500 MW two-pass
boilers currently employed in South Korea, a tiny amount of air enters
the system through the boiler throat due to the internal negative
pressure formed in the boiler during the course of opening the discharge
doors to get rid of bottom ash. Furthermore, the built-in air valves
allow the system to control the flow rate of air coming through the
throat into the bottom part of the boiler. Therefore, an initial simulation
was performed where 5% of the flow rate of total combustion air was
supplied, whereas the entire boiler throat was set as the air inlet.
In this situation, however, the bottom ash that needed to be discharged
through the throat was constantly being blown upward by the air entering
through the bottom. Hence, it was concluded that this method was not
feasible, even if it could lead to improvements in combustion and
reduced NOx emissions. To circumvent this problem, four arbitrarily
sized ports capable of supplying subair in the vertical direction
at a temperature of 340 K were installed at the furnace throat (Figure 6). The cross section
of the injection port was a rectangle with dimensions 0.74 m ×
0.45 m and the port-to-port spacing was set to 2.8 m. Although these
ports may also interfere with the discharge of bottom ash through
the throat by creating an ascending flow along the furnace center,
the results obtained showed improvements compared to those determined
with the first method. Although the number and size of ports could
potentially affect the outcomes of the analysis, these factors were
not considered in great depth in this study and, instead, the focus
was on examining the effect of air supply through the boiler bottom
on fuel combustibility and NOx formation.

Figure 6 Subair supply ports located
at the boiler throat.

In the next step, simulations examining supply of subair
through
ports, set at 5 and 10% of the flow rate of total combustion air,
were performed. The temperature and oxygen distributions determined
in these simulations are shown in Figure 7. High temperature was detected at the bottom
ash hopper as a result of coal combustion from burners A and B, and
the temperature of the furnace center increased as the flow rate of
the subair increased. Conversely, the gas temperature along the fireball
was found to decrease, thereby leading to a relatively even temperature
distribution in the furnace. Analysis of the oxygen distribution in
the 5% case revealed that there is a high concentration of oxygen
at the furnace center—an observation that can be attributed
to the fact that the subair joins the swirling flow rather quickly.
In contrast, the stream of subair supplied in the 10% case was significantly
faster, penetrating deeper into the furnace. Thus, the streams from
each port did not merge together in the ash hopper. The oxygen distribution
in the 10% case was less even than in the 5% case and determined from
on the position of ports.

Figure 7 Temperature and oxygen distributions determined
for two cases employing
subair (5 and 10% of total air).

Table 2 summarizes
the temperature, the char conversion, and the mole fractions of oxygen
and NOx at the boiler exit in the simulation results. Due to the constraints
on the on-site collection of data inside the power plant furnace,
these values are crucial for comparison. The lowest quantity of unburned
carbon was observed when no subair was supplied. Nevertheless, it
cannot be concluded that the subair hinders the coal combustion, as
the char combusted in the boiler varied across the cases examined
due to changes in the outflow rate of coal through the throat. Therefore,
the initial mass of char particles flowing through the boiler exit
was measured and multiplied by the conversion rate at the exit, confirming
that coal combustion increased as the flow rate of subair increased.
It could be confirmed by lower mole fraction of oxygen at the boiler
exit in the 10% case. In addition, the results showed that the fraction
of NOx at the exit decreased. To examine the influence of subair further,
the combustibility and NOx inside the furnace were analyzed.

3.2.1 Combustion Characteristics
To investigate
the effect of subair on the in-furnace combustibility of coal particles,
particle residence time, particle mass, and burnout were analyzed. Figure 8 depicts the particle
residence time determined for each burner level up to the boiler nose.
As the flow rate of subair increased, the residence times of particles
from burners A, B, and C tended to decrease. In contrast, the residence
time of particles from burners D and E increased. These trends correlate
with the gas velocity and for the ease of comparison, the x- and z-components of gas velocity along
the lines are shown in Figure 9. The magnitude of the x-velocity decreased
at both burner A and the lowest SOFA levels in the simulation employing
subair ports. The increase in the residence time of the particles
D and E despite the reduction of swirling velocity can be explained
by the z-velocity, as shown in Figure 9c,d. The vertical component of gas velocity
through the boiler center (y = 0 m) exhibits a positive
correlation with the subair flow rate. The vertical gas velocity observed
at the off-center region, with dense concentration of particles from
burners D and E, on the other hand, tended to decrease as the flow
rate of subair was increased. This change in behavior can be explained
by the decrease in the SA flow rate, which subsequently resulted in
a decrease in the vertical gas velocity at the off-center region.
Overall, however, it was concluded that the changes in the residence
time arising from subair were not significant, with the exception
of burner A.

Figure 8 Residence times of particles in various burner levels.

Figure 9 Gas velocity in (a) x-direction
and (c) z-direction of gas along the line (x =
0 m, y = −8 to 8 m, z at
the burner A level) and (b) x-direction and (d) z-direction along the line (x = 0 m, y = −8 to 8 m, z at the lowest SOFA
level).

In general, the extent of particle
combustion increases with increasing
residence time, however, residence time on its own is not an accurate
indicator of particle combustibility. Hence, the mass distribution
of the particles from each burner was expressed as a function of the
furnace height (Figure 10). As observed for the residence time, the changes in the
flow rate of subair affected predominantly the particles originating
from burner A. The results showed that the mass of these particles
in the region below burner A (including the ash hopper zone, z < 9 m) decreased as the subair flow rate was increased.
The particle mass at the region above burner A was smaller and, therefore,
it may be concluded that combustion took place significantly in the
hopper. In addition, examination of the extent of burnout as a function
of boiler height demonstrated that the supply of subair increased
the burnout in the lower section of the furnace. The majority of particles
that sunk to the hopper were found to originate from burner A, thereby
confirming that the subair supply increases the combustibility of
burner A particles. In contrast, virtually no changes were observed
for burner B in the 5% case. When the proportion of subair was increased
to 10%, however, the mass of these particles in the lower section
of the boiler was found to decrease. Interestingly, at a furnace height
of approximately z = 30 m, the particle mass was
found to be largely similar, irrespective of the subair flow rate.
In terms of the particles originating from burner E, the supply of
subair seemed to hinder the combustion when the flow rate was set
at 10%. As observed previously, there was no change in combustibility
at z = 30 m. Thus, as determined for the residence
time, no significant changes were observed at the top of furnace,
with the exception of burner A.

Figure 10 Mass distribution of particles from each
burner as a function of
furnace height.

Further analysis of
the general changes in burnout across the furnace
(Figure 11) showed
that bulk of the combustion occurs around the burners and SOFA. In
contrast, the combustion in the hopper zone was found to be negligible
in the absence of subair. When the subair accounted for 5%, combustion
took place up to a furnace height of <5 m and the peak burnout
values decreased sharply in the burner zone. The zone with the relatively
low burnout exhibited, on the other hand, an increase in burnout.
When the proportion of subair was increased to 10%, the combustion
in the hopper zone generally increased, with the exception of combustion
below the furnace height of z = 5 m, where the extent
of burnout decreased compared to the 5% case. These differences may
be related to the residence time of particles originating from burner
A, as these particles ascend more rapidly due to increased flow rate
of subair. Additionally, the burnout fluctuations as a function of
height were less noticeable in the burner zone, giving rise to a more
even distribution of burnout. When subair was supplied, it was noted
that the burnout was increased in SOFA zone as well as in burner zone
as shown in accumulated burnout (see right of Figure 11). In summary, reducing SA and simultaneously
supplying subair improved the burnout of particles originating from
burners A and B, whereas the burnout of particles from burners C,
D, and E decreased. Nevertheless, particles from burners C, D, and
E could utilize the oxygen available near the wall in the SOFA zone
more effectively than those from burners A and B, as they followed
a swirling trajectory with a large radius. Thus, the flow rate of
SOFA remained constant, however, the burnout increased when subair
was employed. The increase in burnout observed when the subair flow
rate was increased from 5 to 10% was negligible. The reason why the
accumulated burnout was normalized arises from the fact that the quantities
of particles discharged through the throat and exit change due to
the subair. To show that the increase in burnout in the 10% case was
not due to the decrease in the number of particles exiting through
the boiler throat, accumulated burnout was divided by the initial
mass of char discharged through the exit.

Figure 11 Burnout and normalized
accumulated burnout as a function of furnace
height.

3.2.2 NOx
Formation
Figure 12 illustrates the distribution
of NOx determined as a function of subair flow rate. When the subair
supply was fixed at 0%, the fraction of NOx observed at the furnace
center was very low, and the burner zone exhibited a low concentration
of NOx in general. The fraction of NOx in the SOFA zone was relatively
high compared to other zones—an observation that can be attributed
to the rapid formation of NOx as a result of the combustion of remaining
unburned carbon particles originating from the lower part of the furnace.
In the cases employing subair, the fraction of NOx in the burner zone
increased noticeably; however, the fraction of NOx in the upper parts
of the boiler remained low as a result. To find an explanation for
this result, the NOx formation rate with respect to furnace height
was examined (Figure 13). Specifically, this analysis allowed the effect of subair on the
formation of NOx to be assessed. Additionally, the right side of Figure 13 shows that the
accumulated NOx formation rate was plotted to relate the NOx formation
with the results obtained at the boiler exit. It should be noted that
the units for the accumulated NOx formation rate are not equal to
those of the NOx formation rate. Specifically, the subair increases
the NOx rate at the hopper zone, whose cross-sectional area is different
from that of the furnace above. The NOx formation rate was multiplied
by the volume of the grid cell and then accumulated. The results showed
that the NOx formation rate exhibits a distribution pattern similar
to that determined for burnout. The differences in the influence of
subair were most notable in the hopper zone and level E (at approximately z = 22). When subair was supplied, the SA flow rate was
reduced and the temperature decreased, which led to a decrease in
the NOx formation near level E. The NOx distribution shown in Figure 12 illustrates that
NOx fraction near levels A–D increased with increasing proportion
of subair. This can be explained by the fact that the formation of
NOx at the center of the furnace as a result of the subair caused
the overall fraction of NOx to increase, and not because the combustion
reaction in front of the burners increased.

Figure 12 NOx distribution within
the boiler.

Figure 13 Relationship between
the rate and accumulated rate of NOx formation
as a function of furnace height.

As the flow rate of subair was increased, the NOx formation
rate
in the hopper zone increased; however, the rate in the burner zone
decreased. In the OFA zone, the NOx formation rate was generally decreased
but increased at the higher SOFA. The results showed that subair reduces
the NOx measured at the boiler exit and, therefore, the accumulated
NOx formation rate was examined for comparison. At approximately z = 22 m, the accumulated NOx formation rate was found to
be fairly same across all cases. Nevertheless, the accumulated burnout
at z = 22 m was the highest in the 10% case. As a
result of this significant observation, it can be concluded that the
ratio of NOx formed at the burnout has a negative correlation with
the flow rate of subair supplied. Under normal circumstances, particles
are combusted along the fireball. The subair, however, resulted in
combustion taking place in a scattered manner, which, in turn, decreased
the temperature of fireball. As such, the remaining particles were
combusted at a furnace height of z = 22 m and the
accumulated NOx formation rate was reversed starting at that height.
At approximately z = 35 m, the accumulated NOx formation
rate determined in the 0 and 5% cases were equal; however, the 5%
case exhibited greater burnout. Therefore, in the case employing no
subair, the burnout processes continued and the NOx was slightly larger
than in the 5% case—these outcomes are in agreement with the
results measured at the boiler exit.

4 Conclusions
In the present study, subair was proposed to improve the combustibility
of coal particles and reduce the NOx formation in a 500 MW tangentially
fired coal boiler. The particles from the lower burners, especially
burner A, first sink to the hopper before rising again. Based on this
trajectory, subair was supplied vertically through the injection ports
located at the bottom of ash hopper to promote the combustion of the
particles. In addition, it was hypothesized that the combustion with
subair would moderate the temperature, thus inhibiting NOx formation.
This hypothesis was tested using computational analysis, with particular
focus on combustion characteristics and NOx formation.

The analysis
showed that increasing the proportion of subair increased
the extent of burnout of particles A and B. The burnout of particles
C, D, and E did not deteriorate although the SA diverted to subair.
This is because those particles could consume oxygen effectively near
the wall in the SOFA zone. In addition, the results showed a 6 and
13% decrease in NOx emissions at the boiler exit when the proportion
of subair was set to 5 and 10%, respectively, even though the amount
of burnout in the furnace was increased. Although the supply of subair
resulted in the formation of NOx in the hopper zone, a smaller quantity
of NOx was formed in the burner zone as a result of lower peak temperature
and even temperature distribution.

In summary, although the
use of subair exerted a positive impact
in terms of combustion characteristics and NOx formation, it also
caused a reduction in the bottom ash discharged via the boiler throat.
As the size and number of ports used in this study were selected arbitrarily,
further work should be performed to minimize the impact of ports on
the discharge of bottom ash.
