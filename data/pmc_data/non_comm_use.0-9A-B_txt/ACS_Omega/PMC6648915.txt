In this work, we describe the preparation
and characterization
of highly magnetizable chloromethylated polystyrene-based nanocomposite
beads. For synthesis optimization, acid-resistant core–shelled
maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles are
coated with sodium oleate and directly incorporated into the organic
medium during a suspension polymerization process. A crosslinking
agent, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, is used for copolymerization
with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride to increase the resistance of the microbeads
against leaching. X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and optical microscopy
are used for bead characterization. The beads form a magnetic composite
consisting of ∼500 nm-sized crosslinked polymeric microspheres,
embedding ∼8 nm γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.
This nanocomposite shows large room temperature magnetization (∼24
emu/g) due to the high content of maghemite (∼45 wt %) and
resistance against leaching even in acidic media. Moreover, the presence
of superficial chloromethyl groups is probed by Fourier transform
infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The nanocomposite beads
displaying chloromethyl groups can be used to selectively remove aminated
compounds that are adsorbed on the beads, as is shown here for the
molecular separation of 4-aminobenzoic acid from a mixture with benzoic
acid. The high magnetization of the composite beads makes them suitable
for in situ molecular separations in environmental and biological
applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Magnetic microspheres
have large potential for therapeutic and
diagnostic applications in magnetically driven drug delivery, as contrast
agents in magnetic resonance imaging, as devices for separation of
biomolecules,1 and in the environmental
field as sorbents for removal of pollutants.2 Among various types of nanocomposites, those designed by embedding
magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) into a polymeric matrix stand out as
ideal magnetic-hybrid and magneto-responsive materials, synergically
combining the properties of the polymer matrix and the magnetic NPs.3 The polymer network provides mechanical stability
and a large area for adsorption, whereas the inorganic nanoparticles
bring magnetic responsivity. As a result, magnetic microspheres (or
beads) show a high adsorptive capacity and can be rapidly and easily
displaced by the application of an external magnetic field, replacing
traditional forms of separation, such as centrifugation and filtration.4 In addition, since inorganic NPs encapsulated
in the beads can generate heat through the interaction of their magnetic
moments with an alternating magnetic field, magnetic beads find applications
in magnetic hyperthermia, both in the biomedical5 and environmental6 fields.

Magnetic polymer beads have additional characteristics that make
them very appealing in the separation field. The polymeric matrix
can be formed by different polymers that, besides encapsulating the
magnetic NPs, bring the nanocomposites’ functional groups,
including groups for covalent coupling, and adsorption and affinity
binding groups, necessary for the immobilization of molecules in the
beads.1 Covalent coupling is often desired
for the immobilization of species on the nanocomposite surface, to
keep them permanently bonded, not desorbing or leaching over time.7 Covalent coupling also brings specificity to
the magnetic beads, since unwanted adsorbates, that may be attached
nonspecifically or unbound to the surface, can be separated by successive
washes/magnetic separations. Moreover, after magnetic separation,
it is also possible to recover the adsorbate covalently bound to the
nanocomposite surface through detaching/cleavage protocols.8

The continued interest in the development
of new materials for
trapping and separating molecules led us to propose the elaboration
of a magnetic nanocomposite based on poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride)
(PVBC) microspheres embedding magnetic NPs. The vinylbenzyl chloride
monomer (VBC) can be copolymerized with different monomers and displays
the very reactive chloromethyl groups (−CH2Cl) that
retain their reactivity after polymerization, and can be covalently
and reversibly bonded with a wide variety of organic moieties.9 Thus, PVBC acts as a polymeric support to carry
out different reactions with multiple molecules, and after the molecular
synthesis is completed, the covalently bound molecule can be separated
from the chloromethyl group. Indeed, this material was the pioneer
for the development of solid support resins for the synthesis of peptides—the
Merrifield resin.10

Despite the potential
applications of these materials, there are
few reports on the elaboration of magnetic PVBC-based nanocomposites
for separation and recovery of molecules. For instance, Rana and co-workers11 prepared magnetic beads for solid-phase synthesis
and reaction scavenging. In their process, magnetite particles were
encapsulated within highly crosslinked polystyrene (chloromethyl styrene)
through suspension polymerization. Darwish et al12 reported the elaboration of nanocomposites with this chlorine
functionality, prepared by dispersion of oleate-coated magnetite nanoparticles
on VBC by a multistep miniemulsion polymerization procedure. Using
Fe3O4, Chen and co-workers13 described the synthesis of a core–shelled magneto-polymeric
materials through emulsion polymerization. The synthesized Fe3O4@PVBC beads were successfully used for the enhancement
of catalytic activity and stability of immobilized lipase by interfacial
activation.

In our work, maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) NPs
are chosen as the magnetic component of the nanocomposite, since they
are more stable than magnetite, Fe3O4 (commonly
employed for these purposes), and present relatively low toxicity
and high saturation magnetization.14 Moreover,
in the synthetic method used, these NPs present a core–shell
design with a thin surface layer that avoids dissolution of NPs in
acidic medium.15,16 Besides, our γ-Fe2O3 NPs were capped with oleate molecules, to improve their
affinity to the organic phase during synthesis and guarantee a nanocomposite
with a high charge of NPs homogeneously dispersed into the polymeric
matrix.

We show here a cost-effective and potentially large-scale
alternative
by the direct incorporation of magnetic NPs into polystyrene beads
by their inclusion into the polymerization mixture to produce a chloromethylated
polystyrene-based nanocomposite with potential applications in the
biomedical and environmental fields. The use of a simple suspension
copolymerization method with an adequate crosslinking agent, associated
with the hydrophobic-coated (and acid-resistant) γ-Fe2O3 NPs, led to a homogeneous nanocomposite with high magnetization
saturation, not reported before, and high resistance against leaching
even under acidic treatment. To test the potential of this nanocomposite
to be used in selective separation of molecules through covalent coupling,
a case study of selective adsorption was performed for the separation
of 4-aminobenzoic acid (p-aminobenzoic acid, PABA)
from a mixture with benzoic acid (BA). Particularly, PABA has been
extensively applied in the dye stuff industry, pharmaceutical intermediates,
and sunscreen. Therefore, developing efficient methods to separate
and purify PABA is very important.17 Besides,
this is a representative system of the potential of the nanocomposite
for molecular separations since both acids have the same benzenecarboxylic
acid backbone; nevertheless, the amino groups present only in PABA
lead to its selective immobilization through covalent coupling with
the superficial chloromethyl moieties of the nanocomposite. The work
presented here proposes a strategy for the use of magnetic beads to
selectively conjugate PABA that can be extended to other molecules
by simple variation of coupling conditions and applied for selective
molecule removal in environmental and biomedical applications.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Iron(III)
chloride hexahydrate
(FeCl3·6H2O); iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate
(FeCl2·4H2O); iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Fe(NO3)3·9H2O); nitric acid
(HNO3); oleic acid; the monomer, 4-vinylbenzyl chloride
(VBC); the crosslinking agent, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA);
the stabilizer, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw = 125 000); and the initiator, benzoyl peroxide (PBO), were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Sample Elaboration
The scheme of
fabrication of the hybrid magnetic beads is shown in Figure 1. In a first step (Figure 1a), the elaboration
of maghemite nanoparticles was carried out by following a procedure
described elsewhere with a few modifications.18 Briefly, 125 mL of NH4OH aqueous solution (2 mol/L) were
quickly poured into 150 mL of aqueous solution containing 50 mmol
of Fe3+, 25 mmol of Fe3+, and 20 mmol of HCl,
under vigorous stirring (1000 rpm) at room temperature, for 60 min,
to form a magnetite precipitate (Fe3O4). The
precipitate was magnetically separated and washed with water several
times until the solution reached neutral pH. Then, the NPs were acidified
with HNO3 (0.5 mol/L) and boiled with 0.5 mol/L Fe(NO3)3 for 30 min. This procedure was utilized both
to oxidize magnetite to maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) and to create a layer rich in iron that protects the particles
from acid dissolution.16 Finally, the precipitate
was washed with acetone several times and dried at ∼60 °C.
Then, maghemite NPs were functionalized with oleate molecules using
a modification of a method described elsewhere.19 In a typical experiment, the synthesized maghemite NPs
were dispersed into 200 mL of water, and the pH of the solution was
adjusted to ∼3. After heating this solution until 80 °C,
oleic acid (2 mL/g of γ-Fe2O3) was dropped
at a rate of ∼1 mL/min, and the mixture was stirred for 30
min. Within a few minutes, NPs were spontaneously transferred to the
oily phase that, after cooling, was separated from the colorless water
phase and washed five times with ethanol to remove water and excess
surfactant, followed by drying at 60 C°. This sample will be
referred to as MNP.

Figure 1 General scheme for the synthesis of oleate-capped γ-Fe2O3 NPs (a) and for the elaboration of magnetic
PVBC beads (b).

In a second step (Figure 1b), the preparation
of the MNP-loaded PVBC composite was achieved
by adopting a suspension polymerization procedure for nonmagnetic
PVBC microbeads described elsewhere.20 The
details are as follows: 300 mg of as-prepared oleate-coated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (MNP), 1.5 mL of EGDMA, 5.0 mL
of VBC, and 0.12 g of PBO were well dissolved/dispersed in 7.5 mL
of heptane. The resulting solution was dispersed in 80 mL of an aqueous
PVA solution (3.2 g/L), and the polymerization was carried out at
80 °C for 8 h, with the mechanical stirring rate kept constant
at 800 rpm. After polymerization, the MNP-loaded PVBC composite (labeled
MNP@PVBC) was washed exhaustively with ethanol, and then with water,
to remove the diluent and unreacted monomer. Before the synthesis
of our magnetic sorbent, we tested nanocomposites with different magnetic
charges (25, 50, and 75 wt %). We found that nanocomposites with ∼50
wt % of magnetic material presented very high magnetization when compared
to similar composites in the literature, easy separation by magnetic
decantation, and preservation of the chemical functionalities of the
polymer.

2.3 Sample Characterization
The size
and morphology were evaluated by high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2100 JEOL microscope and by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a Quanta 250 FEG. The
particle size distribution was estimated from measuring about 300
particles (spherical shaped) found in an arbitrarily chosen area in
enlarged images and using log-normal distribution. The crystalline
structure of maghemite was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in
a Rigaku-Miniflex 600 diffractometer, with a radiation of 1.541 Å
(40 kV and 30 mA). Magnetization curves (at room temperature) were
obtained in a magnetic field range of −20 to +20 kOe using
a vibrating sample magnetometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were recorded with KBr pellets in the region of 4000–400
cm–1 on a Varian FTIR spectrophotometer with a resolution
of 2 cm–1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
conducted on a Shimadzu TG 60 thermogravimetric analyzer under a N2 dynamic atmosphere (50 cm3/min) in the temperature
range of 35–600 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The chemical composition was determined by Inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using an Optima 8000 DV ICP
spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, in optical emission mode.21 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were
performed on a SPECS Sage HR 100 spectrometer with a nonmonochromatic
X-ray source (Mg Kα line of 1253.6 eV energy and 250 W) and
calibrated using the 3d5/2 line of Ag with a full-width
at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.1 eV. The selected resolution for the
spectra was 15 eV of pass energy and 0.15 eV/step. All measurements
were made in an ultra-high vacuum chamber at a pressure of around
8 × 10–8 mbar. An electron flood gun was used
to compensate for charging during XPS data acquisition. In the fittings,
Gaussian–Lorentzian functions were used (after a Shirley background
correction), where the FWHM of the peaks was constrained, whereas
the peak positions and areas were set free. The peak position of each
band was compared with the values available in the literature. The
surface and pore-size distribution of outgassed samples were measured
via N2 adsorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020
analyzer and using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
model.

2.4 Batch Adsorption Experiments
Adsorption
experiments were performed in conical tubes containing 100 mg of MNP@PVBC
and 10 mL of PABA solution in the appropriate concentration. The flasks
were placed in a Dubnoff orbital shaking water bath at 25 °C
and ∼200 rpm. To evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity,
the supernatant’s initial and residual PABA concentrations
were quantified using a Hitachi 3900 H UV–vis spectrometer
in a quartz cell with a 1.0 cm optical path. Typical initial PABA
concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 mg/L. To determine the minimum
time required for adsorption to reach equilibrium, adsorption kinetic
studies were carried out with an initial PABA concentration of 10
mg/L at 25 °C and ∼200 rpm. The concentrations of PABA
were measured at different time intervals from 0 to 360 min.

The conventional kinetic models, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order—expressed,
respectively, as qt = qe ln(1 – exp–k1t) and —were applied to analyze
the experimental
data of adsorption kinetics for a better understanding of the mechanism
of adsorption.22 The rate constants of
the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order models are, respectively, k1 (1/min) and k2 (g/(mg min)). The amount of adsorption at equilibrium, qe (mg/g), can be calculated by , where C0 and Ce (mg/L) are the liquid-phase
concentrations
of the adsorbate initially and at equilibrium, respectively, V is the volume of the solution (L), and m is the mass of the dry adsorbent used (g). The amount of adsorbate
on the adsorbent at a time t, qt (mg/g), is likewise calculated by , where Ct (mg/L)
is the liquid-phase concentration of the adsorbate at time t. To evaluate how the absorbent and the adsorbate interact
when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium, Langmuir and Freundlich
classical isotherm models were applied.23 In the Langmuir equation, , where qL (mg/g)
is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and kL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant, which is related to
the affinity of the binding sites. The Freundlich equation is described
as qe = KFCe1/n, where KF is
the Freundlich isotherm constant and 1/n is the heterogeneity
factor.

3 Results and Discussion
In the TEM image of oleate-coated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (MNP) shown in Figure 2a, NPs present a nearly spherical morphology and are
polydisperse in size. The average diameter and polydispersity index
were 10.6 nm and 0.22, respectively, and were calculated from the
histogram in Figure 2b. Furthermore, the lattice fringes (0.24 nm) in Figure 2c agree well with the distance
between the (311) lattice planes of the maghemite structure. The XRD
pattern of the oleate-coated γ-Fe2O3 sample
is shown in Figure 2d. All peaks could be readily indexed to a face-centered cubic spinel
structure (Fd3m) of maghemite, and
the calculated lattice parameter (0.83488) showed good correlation
with the expected value (0.83515 nm), obtained from the literature
(JCPDS #39-1346). Moreover, the crystallite size (dXR = 8.7 nm) and strain (ε = 4.9 × 10–3) were, respectively, obtained from the intercept on the y-axis and the slope of the line on the Williamson–Hall
plot (inset of Figure 2d), through the equation β cos θ = 0.94λ/dXR + 2ε sin θ, where
λ is the wavelength of X-rays, β is the broadening of
the diffraction peak measured at half of its maximum intensity, and
θ is Bragg’s diffraction angle.24

Figure 2e shows
the MNP@PVBC composite under the action of a permanent magnet. In
the image, it can be seen that the hybrid beads with the magnetic
NPs resulted in a macroscopic homogeneous magnetizable material. Moreover,
as shown by optical micrography of the MNP@PVBC composite (see Figure 2f), fairly uniform
spherical microparticles with sizes ∼500 μm were formed
during polymerization.

As shown in the SEM image of Figure 3a, the magnetic PVBC
beads possess a relatively uniform
rough surface. In the highly magnified image in Figure 3b, the presence of numerous pores can be
recognized. The authors ascribe the presence of pores in polymer matrixes
to the possible presence of amphiphilic, partially hydrolyzed polymer
that is able to trap water, stabilizing it inside the oil droplets
and resulting in the formation of pores.25 Moreover, a porous structure can allow the easy penetration of reagents,
especially in the presence of swelling solvents,10 which can be useful for the application of nanocomposite
as solid support for organic reactions and magnetic separations. Higher
magnified images of MNP@PVBC (see Figure 3c) show that γ-Fe2O3 NPs are trapped on the surface and inside of the pores of
the PVBC beads. Moreover, a TEM image of an internal slice of the
MNP@PVBC sample (Figure 3d) indicates that γ-Fe2O3 NPs are also
embedded into the polymer core (light-gray part). The composite beads
display a surface area of ∼320 m2/g and pore volume
of ∼0.085 cm3/g, as obtained from BET (see Figure 3e), and these results
corroborate the SEM measurements. Large superficial area and small
pore diameter could be also due to the presence of nanosized particles,
respectively, at the surface and in the pores of the polymer structures.

(hollow points) isotherms of MNP@PVBC (e).

Thermogravimetric analysis was used for the estimation of
the mass
percentage of magnetic NPs on the nanocomposite. Most of the loss
of mass presented by the multistage weight loss profile of the MNP@PVBC
composite (see Figure 4a) can be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the polymeric/organic
counterpart and eventually free and chemically adsorbed water.26 In the case of oleate-coated NPs, the weight
loss must be mostly due to the adsorbed oleate capping.27 The magnetic content (in terms of γ-Fe2O3 wt %) determined from TGA data for MNP and MNP@PVBC
samples were, respectively, ∼16 and 55%.

Figure 4 Thermograms (a) and magnetization
curves (b) obtained for the oleate-capped
γ-Fe2O3 NPs (MNP) and magnetic nanocomposite
(MNP@PVBC).

Magnetization measurements
were also performed to evaluate the
counterparts of the polymeric phase in the magnetic properties of
the nanocomposite. Figure 4b shows the room temperature magnetization as a function of
the applied magnetic field for the oleate-capped γ-Fe2O3 (MNP) and MNP@PVBC nanocomposite. The saturation magnetization
(Ms) of the MNP sample, determined at
the maximum applied magnetic field, was ∼50.7 emu/g and was
found to be lower than the bulk magnetization of maghemite (∼80
emu/g).28 This decrease can be caused by
the surface coordination,29 cationic redistribution,30 and surface and finite size effects,31,32 which affect the magnetic properties of nanosized grains. Moreover,
nanoparticles show superparamagnetic-like behavior, with negligible
remanence and coercivity. After polymerization, the saturation magnetization
of the nanocomposite decreased to ∼24.3 emu/g, supporting the
claim that magnetic NPs are embedded in a “nonmagnetic”
polymeric matrix to form a multicore system. If one assumes that the
magnetic core is preserved after dispersion into the polymeric matrix,
the extent of the decrease in Ms can be
associated with the amount of polymeric material around the NPs.33 Then, the amount of magnetic material can be
estimated to be ∼47.9% in mass, slightly lower than that determined
from TGA measurements. Besides, the dosage of iron on the MNP@PVBC
sample using ICP-OES allowed estimating a magnetic content of ∼44.5
wt % in γ-Fe2O3, in close agreement with
the magnetization data.

Figure 5 shows the
FTIR spectra of the MNP and MNP@PVBC samples. The spectrum of PVBC
blank beads, synthesized as described for the MNP@PVBC sample in the Materials and Methods section, but without γ-Fe2O3 NPs, is also shown in this graph for comparison
purposes. The main vibration bands were depicted with the intention
of helping in probing the architecture of the nanocomposite. In the
spectrum of oleate-capped maghemite NPs, the broad structure below
800 cm–1 can be attributed to Fe–O vibrations
of the crystalline lattice of nanocrystalline γ-Fe2O3.15 The intense peak at ∼1385
cm–1 could be due to adsorbed NO3– ions during the synthesis of iron oxide (see peak
deconvolution in the inset), and the characteristic bands of −OH
appeared at 3437 cm–1, which was probably due to
water adsorption on the NP’s surface.14 The asymmetric CH2 stretch and the symmetric CH2 stretch from the oleic acid backbone appear at 2924 and 2853 cm–1, respectively.34 Also,
the carbonyl vibrations of free oleic acid (normally at ∼1710
cm–1) are absent in this sample and replaced by
the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxyl (−COO–) at 1632 and 1413 cm–1, indicating
that the oleic acid is chemisorbed on the nanoparticles’ surface
through iron metal carboxylate coordination.34

Figure 5 FTIR
spectrum of the magnetic nanocomposite (MNP@PVBC) compared
to their respective constituents.

This is a crucial condition for the successful synthesis
of the
magnetic PVBC beads, since the γ-Fe2O3 NPs after coprecipitation have a polar surface6 and thus are not able to disperse into the polymeric matrix.
After oleate grafting, the NP’s surface becomes hydrophobic
and can be dispersed into the organic phase and homogeneously trapped
into the polymer body during polymerization.27 In the pure PVBC FTIR spectrum, the broad band at 3441 cm–1 (O–H stretching vibration) also suggests the presence of
adsorbed water on the polymer and possibly the presence of PVA utilized
in the synthesis.13 The C–H stretching
vibrations with absorption bands between 2924 and 2853 cm–1 also appear, indicating the presence of PVA and EGDMA components.
The absorption bands corresponding to the aromatic ring with di-substituted
C=C appear between 1440 and 1640 cm–1, confirming
the formation of PVBC.12 Moreover, the
carbonyl stretch of EGDMA falls at 1724 cm–1, and
the absorptions for the C–Cl bond at 1267 and 661 cm–1 can be seen, confirming the presence of chloromethyl groups on the
microbeads’ surface.35

The
main vibrations observed in the spectra of pure PVBC and those
of oleate-coated γ-Fe2O3 NPs are still
present in the spectrum of magnetic PVBC beads (sample MNP@PVBC),
confirming the presence of inorganic NPs embedded into the polymeric
matrix. Moreover, the slight dislocation of some bands, when compared
with pure components, indicates the interaction between inorganic
and organic polymeric phases.

The XPS spectra of Fe 2p, C 1s,
Cl 2p and O 1s core levels in Figure 6 give additional
proof of the chemical structure and surface composition of the microbeads.
More specifically, in the Fe 2p core-level spectrum of the MNP@PVBC
sample (Figure 6a),
the Fe (2p3/2) and Fe (2p1/2) peaks appear at
about 711.7 and 725.2 eV, respectively, indicating that iron is fully
oxidized and magnetic NPs are composed of maghemite.36 Indeed, this Fe (2p3/2) peak is a characteristic
of the core-level electrons, whereas the Fe (2p1/2) peak
can be attributed to the carboxylate–Fe bond.37 The large peak in the C 1s core-level spectrum of the MNP@PVBC
surface (Figure 6b)
is ascribed to the convolution of the C–H/C–C, C–O/C–Cl,
and O=C–O species, with components centered at about
284.6, 286.3, and 288.5 eV, confirming the formation of the PVBC structure
and the presence of the oleate coating.20

Figure 6 Fe
2p (a), C 1s (b), O 1s (c) and Cl 2p (d) core-level XPS spectra
of the magnetic nanocomposite (MNP@PVBC).

Moreover, the contribution of the O=C–O component
in the fitted curve also indicates a successful crosslinking of EGDMA
in the copolymer. Besides, the absence of the C 1s peak corresponding
to carboxylic carbon (−COOH), normally posited at 290 eV, indicates
the absence of free oleic acid on the coated γ-Fe2O3 NPs.37 The O 1s spectrum
in Figure 6c is deconvoluted
into three peaks at binding energies of about 533.1, 531.4, and 529.9
eV, respectively, corresponding to −OH, C–O, and Fe–O
moieties,38 reinforcing the successful
embedding of oleate-coated maghemite NPs into the body of the crosslinked
copolymer. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6d, the Cl 2p core-level spectrum of the MNP@PVBC
sample consists of the Cl (2p3/2) and Cl (2p1/2) doublet centered at about 199.7 and 197.5 eV, respectively, attributable
to the covalently bonded chlorine (C–Cl) species, thus confirming
the presence of chloromethyl moieties on the nanocomposite surface.20

The leaching of magnetic NPs and iron
from the beads was investigated
by stirring the MNP@PVBC sample for 60 min in water at pH ∼
7. After magnetic separation, the analysis of the supernatant using
ICP-OES showed that the NPs were stably incorporated into the polymer
core. Treatment of the nanocomposite in a similar way with 0.1 mol/L
NaOH, 0.1 mol/L HCl, and trifluoroacetic acid (25%) resulted in low
levels of iron in solution (< 100 μg/L). Since iron leaching
was not observed even under acidic treatment, and also from the cross-analysis
of XRD, microscopy, magnetization, TGA, and ICP-OES results substantiated
with the FTIR and XPS data, we can conclude that we have produced
a copolymer of PVBC crosslinked with EGDMA and firmly trapped γ-Fe2O3 NPs, forming a homogeneous magnetic nanocomposite.
The high chemical stability of the core-designed magnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs also must have contributed to the resistance
of the nanocomposite against dissolution.

Besides, a chloromethylated
material with a large amount of −CH2Cl functional
groups bonded to the microbeads’ surface
was produced. In fact, the availability of −CH2Cl
groups on the nanocomposite surface was assessed by a simple test,
as shown in Figure 7a. After synthesis, due to the presence of chloromethyl groups on
the surface, the nanocomposite has a hydrophobic character and is
poorly dispersible in water. After mixing with ammonium hydroxide
(2.0 mol/L), amination of superficial chloromethyl groups occurs and
dispersion of the nanocomposite is easier in aqueous solution, due
to the more hydrophilic −CH2NH2 groups,
formed after the reaction.13

and 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) mixture, before interaction (blue full
line) and after interaction (red dashed line) with the MNP@PVBC nanocomposite.
The inset shows a reaction scheme of MNP@PVBC with BA and PABA.

To evaluate the potential of this
nanocomposite to be used in selective
separation of molecules through covalent coupling, a case study of
selective adsorption was performed for the separation of 4-aminobenzoic
acid (PABA) from a mixture with benzoic acid (BA). In a qualitative
test, beads were suspended in a solution of benzoic acid (BA) and
4-aminobenzoic acid (or p-aminobenzoic acid, PABA),
10 mg/L at pH ∼ 7 for 60 min under magnetic stirring. Then,
the beads were separated magnetically with a permanent magnet, and
the supernatant was analyzed using UV–vis spectroscopy. As
shown in the spectra of Figure 7b, the characteristic absorbance of PABA at ∼268 nm
decreased substantially, whereas the absorbance of BA at ∼230
nm was only slightly reduced after interaction with magnetic microbeads.
The decrease in the absorbance of PABA is due to the nucleophilic
reaction of −NH2 groups of PABA with the chloromethyl
moieties of the nanocomposite. Then, the covalently bonded PABA is
removed together with the beads during magnetic separation. However,
BA is not removed as its carboxylic group does not form a covalent
linkage with chloromethyl under these experimental conditions.39 This qualitative test hints that the magnetic
beads could be applied to selectively conjugate different molecules
by a simple variation of coupling conditions and applied for selective
molecule removal.

Batch mode kinetics and isotherm studies were
also carried out
to evaluate the performance of our beads and gain insight into the
mechanisms involved in the selective adsorption. Figure 8 shows the effect of contact
time on the adsorption of PABA and BA by magnetic sorbents. The adsorption
capacity of PABA (black spheres) quickly increased until ∼100
min and then slowly until the adsorption equilibrium was reached within t > 120 min. Otherwise, the constant and low adsorption
capacity of BA (gray spheres) indicates this acid was not efficiently
adsorbed by the nanosorbents even at longer times. The kinetic parameters
and correlation coefficients obtained from data fitting using the
models described in the experimental part, for PABA adsorption, are
summarized in Table 1. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fits the adsorption
of PABA. Indeed, the R2 coefficient for
the pseudo-second-order model slightly exceeded that of the pseudo-first-order
model. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity extrapolated from the
graph is in better accordance with the adsorption capacity obtained
from the pseudo-second-order model than that obtained using the pseudo-first-order
kinetic model. On the basis of the above result, a contact time of
120 min was selected for ensured establishment of the adsorption equilibrium
in further adsorption studies.

As shown in Figure 9, the adsorption isotherm of PABA in MNP@PVBC
showed a nonlinear
shape over a wide range of PABA concentrations. The adsorption capacity
of the magnetic sorbent increased with increasing equilibrium concentration
of PABA, tending to reach saturation progressively. The simulated
curves using Langmuir and Freundlich equations are also plotted in
the graph of Figure 9, and their calculated parameters are listed in Table 1. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm
assumes that ideal adsorption occurs at a fixed number of finite and
identical localized surface sites, with each site holding one adsorbate
molecule, forming a monolayer, and no subsequent interaction between
adsorbed species. Otherwise, the Freundlich model is an empirical
model for heterogeneous systems which describes reversible adsorption
not restricted to the formation of a monolayer.23 The Langmuir correlation coefficient is much higher than
that of the Freundlich isotherm, indicating that Langmuir is the best
fit model, and there is a tendency to form a PABA monolayer on the
sorbent surface. These results corroborate the proposed model of molecular
adsorption of amino moieties from PABA by the chloromethyl groups
on the surface of the magnetic sorbent. Once −CH2Cl superficial sites are occupied by PABA (forming a monolayer),
the adsorption decreases, since no more chloromethyl groups are available
to form successive layers of adsorption. Moreover, in the interval
of C0 investigated, the separation factor
parameter  lies between ∼0.03
and ∼0.9,
indicating a favorable condition for adsorption, thus suggesting the
applicability of this magnetic sorbent for PABA removal from a mixture
with BA.

sorbent. The solid line corresponds to the Langmuir model simulation;

Compared with other similar materials in the limited
available
literature, we apply a simple methodology leading to a homogeneous
nanocomposite with a high magnetization saturation, not reported before,
and a high resistance against leaching even under acidic treatment.
For instance, magnetite particles were encapsulated within highly
crosslinked polystyrene (chloromethyl styrene) through suspension
polymerization.11 These microbeads presented
resistance against iron leaching in acid media; however, the magnetization
was very small with a resin containing ∼0.6 wt % of magnetic
material. Magnetic nanocomposites with this chlorine functionality
were also prepared by dispersion of oleate-coated magnetite nanoparticles
on VBC by a multistep miniemulsion polymerization procedure.12 In this process, the material contained 1–2
wt % of magnetic material and presented some leaching of iron in the
presence of concentrated acids.

To the best of our knowledge,
there has been no report on the preparation
of chloromethylated magnetic beads for PABA for the removal of aminated
compounds. Besides, a few reports deal with the preparation of similar
chloromethyl functionalized polymeric beads for the removal of other
adsorbate species. These works mainly take advantage of the ability
of −CH2Cl to follow click reactions for tuning the
surface functionality of beads, increasing their specific adsorptive
capacity for a given species. For instance, Lapwanit et al.40 prepared chelating magnetic copolymer beads,
based on poly(vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene-co-divinylbenzene), by click attachment with propargyl alcohol
via triazole formation. This surface chemical functionality allowed
metal chelate adsorption, for Zn(II), Cu(II), and Ni(II), with adsorption
capacities of about 67, 61, and 57 mg/g, respectively.

Our composite
beads showed good performance, in view of adsorptive
assays for PABA, when compared with other nonmagnetic beads. Wang
et al.17 showed the preparation of a chloromethylated
poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) hyper-crosslinked
resin, modified with formaldehyde carbonyl, quinone carbonyl, and
phenolic hydroxyl groups, for the adsorption of PABA. The authors
found that the isotherms followed the Langmuir model, with an adsorption
kinetics that could be characterized by a pseudo-second-order rate
equation, and that the formation of hydrogen bonding between the surface
groups and PABA was one of the primary driving forces for the adsorption.
The authors reported an adsorption capacity of ∼75 mg/g (and
equilibrium times >100 min) for PABA. Yu et al.40 produced l-malic acid-modified hyper-crosslinked
resins, synthesized from a macroporous chloromethylated styrene–divinylbenzene
copolymer by Friedel–Crafts reaction and esterification reaction
for PABA adsorption. The authors associated the optimal adsorption
capacity (>200 mg/g) of beads with hydrogen bonding driving force
and hydrophilicity enhancement. Besides, kinetic curves were characterized
by a pseudo-second-order rate equation (equilibrium time ∼200
min), and the isotherms could be fitted by the Langmuir model.

We believe that the good performance of our beads is because PABA
is covalently linked to the polymer matrix, which is more effective
in removing PABA from solution. Moreover, the high magnetization of
the composite beads makes them suitable for in situ molecular separations
in environmental and biological applications.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated an effective strategy for the
fabrication of chloromethylated polystyrene-based magnetic nanocomposite
beads. The beads displayed a high saturation magnetization, due to
the large amount of magnetic material, and improved resistance against
acidic dissolution, thanks to the crosslinking and the presence of
core–shelled magnetic NPs. Moreover, high loading of chloromethyl
groups and high accessibility of the reactive sites for selective
coupling of molecules were demonstrated. Chloromethyl groups can be
used for selective coupling of molecules from solutions with several
molecules, and the coupled molecules will be then magnetically removed
from solution with the beads. We showed here that aminated compounds
can be selectively removed from molecular mixtures by means of the
magnetic composite beads. Based on the results, the nanocomposite
fabricated in this work demonstrated large potential to be used as
a tool for selective removal of pollutants from contaminated water
through magnetically assisted covalent separation. Applications such
as magnetic solid supports for the separation, immobilization, or
synthesis of biomolecules in the biomedical field could also be considered
for this material. A very important result from this work is that
it is possible to obtain composite polymer beads with a magnetization
not higher than that reported in the literature for similar polymer
chemistry. The high magnetization of the beads ensures that they can
be recovered applying a magnetic field, which makes them suitable
for in situ applications, where other methodologies for separation
are not possible.
