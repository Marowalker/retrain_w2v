Puromycin
is a well-known antibiotic that is used to study the
mechanism of protein synthesis and to monitor ribosome activity due
to its incorporation into nascent peptide chains. However, puromycin
effects outside the ribosome catalytic core remain unexplored. Here,
we developed two analogues (3PB and 3PC) of the 3′-end of tyrosylated-tRNA
that can efficiently interact with several proteins associated with
ribosomes. We biochemically characterized the binding of these analogues
and globally mapped the direct small molecule–protein interactions
in living cells using clickable and photoreactive puromycin-like probes
in combination with in-depth mass spectrometry. We identified a list
of proteins targeted by the molecules during ribosome activity (e.g.,
GRP78), and we addressed possible uses of the probes to sense the
activity of protein synthesis and to capture associated RNA. By coupling
genome-wide RNA sequencing methods with these molecules, the characterization
of unexplored translational control mechanisms will be feasible.

Introduction
The ribosome is a dynamic
platform that converts genetic information
within mRNA into corresponding polypeptide sequences. Many aspects
of this translation machinery have been revealed, from the characterization
of the ribosome structure and catalytic activity1,2 to
the organized structure of polyribosomes.3,4 At
the very beginning of these studies, many antibiotics were used to
probe the fundamental mechanisms of protein synthesis. Puromycin,
an analogue of the 3′-end of tyrosylated-tRNA,5,6 was one of the first drugs used because it participates in peptide
bond formation7 through the irreversible
reaction of its α-amino group with the peptidyl tRNA, causing
release of the nascent peptide and ribosome dissociation along the
transcript.8 A number of synthetic derivatives
have been tested as substrate analogues to probe ribosome catalytic
activity, to control puromycin incorporation in nascent peptides9−12 and to sense intracellular chemical compounds.13,14 Nevertheless, the activity of puromycin derivatives outside the
framework of peptide bond formation has never been examined in detail.
Here, starting from the hypothesis that molecules resembling the 3′
end of the tRNA may bind close to the A site of the ribosome, we show
that UV-active puromycin derivatives that cannot be transferred to
the growing peptide chain can be used to study protein synthesis activity
and label productive ribosome-associated protein. We applied them
with the aim of labeling the network of proteins cooperating with
ribosomes during protein synthesis for monitoring translation and
chasing changes in protein expression because of the “subtle”
variation in the translational machinery.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis
For the analysis of the effects
of α-amino-modified puromycin derivatives not reactive with
the growing peptide chain and for mapping their binding sites in living
cells, we inferred that the probes would need four general features:
(i) the ability to cross the cell membrane, (ii) a UV-active moiety
to covalently bind to targets, (iii) a latent affinity handle for
downstream labeling,15 and (iv) a conserved
puromycin scaffold for the detection of targets with commercially
available antibodies. Based on these considerations, we synthetized
three different probes (collectively called 3Px), placing a UV-active
diazirine residue at the 5′-OH (3PA), at the 2′-OH (3PB),
or at both the 2′- and 5′-OH (celled 3PC) of the ribose.
We choose the aliphatic methyl diazirine residue for (i) the small
size and minimal steric demands; and (ii) the high specificity: covalent
cross-linking will occur if the molecule is proximal to the target;
alternatively, diazirine will be quenched by water or it will undergo
intramolecular rearrangements leading to inactive alkenes.16 To avoid puromycin incorporation into new peptide
chains, we added an alkyne affinity handle at the puromycin α-amino
group using a linker unit (Figure 1a; for details on the chemical synthesis, see the Methods
and Supporting Information sections). As
a whole, the alkyne is used to enrich and identify possible targets
via copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC17 or copper-catalyzed “click” reactions),
while the diazirine moiety on the sugar ring permits covalent binding
to the targets upon UV light (365 nm) irradiation.

Target Profiling in Human
Cells
For our initial analysis,
we treated HEK-293 and MCF7 cells in a complete culture medium with
the 3PB probe (10 μM) for 10 min, followed by UV irradiation
for 5 min (total power: 0.75 J/cm2). We assessed the labeling
of cellular proteins by 3Px using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Immunoblotting with an anti-puromycin
antibody showed specific puromycin-tagged proteins of approximately
65 kDa in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Figures 1b,c and S1a).
The incorporation is more specific with respect to standard puromycin
and 3Px probes are targeting only a subset of proteins even at higher
concentrations (1 mM, Figure 1d,e). The labeling results from UV irradiation are concentration-
and diazirino-dependent, as demonstrated by comparative experiments
with or without UV treatment and with similar molecules lacking the
diazirine tag (Figure S1b,d,e). To better
localize the targeted cellular compartment, we performed fluorescence
microscopy experiments using a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum
(calnexin). Coimmunofluorescence analysis of 3Px conjugated Cy3 shows
that the probe accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 1f). We then compared
the labeling activity of 3PB, 3PA, and 3PC in HEK293 and MCF7 cells
by adding the probes before or after cell lysis. Both 3PB and 3PC
showed additional bands of ∼50 kDa when reacted with a cell
lysate compared to growing cells (Figure S1c,e), suggesting a partial loss of selectivity after cell lysis, where
cellular components are not organized and fully functional. We observed
a concentration-dependent increase in protein labeling for 3PB and
3PC. No detectable signals from 3PA were observed (Figure S1b,c), meaning that 5′-OH is essential for
the binding. All these results confirm the selective binding of 3PB
and 3PC to cellular protein targets mainly located in the endoplasmic
reticulum.

Protein Synthesis Activity Affects 3Px Binding
Because
unmodified puromycin binds active ribosomes, we next asked if the
binding of our modified puromycin probes was dependent on global translation.
We approached this question by taking advantage of cell treatments
known to elicit the repression of protein synthesis (i.e., sodium
arsenite and reduced serum concentrations).

We treated MCF7
cells with arsenite (1 mM, 1 h) or incubated them with 0.5% fetal
bovine serum (18 h). Remarkably, the 3PB protein labeling efficiency
was strongly (Figure 2a) reduced by both treatments, suggesting two possible causes: (i)
a decrease in the total target protein abundance after stress induction
or (ii) different affinity of the probes for the targets upon stress.
Therefore, we asked whether the labeling was sensitive to puromycin
treatment (i.e., ribosome activity). To do so, we first treated the
MCF7 cells with puromycin and then incubated them with 3PB or 3PC
for 10 min. Puromycin can be incorporated into neosynthesized proteins
causing ribosome disassembly18,19 and the block of translation.20 We defined the lowest detectable concentration
for puromycin incorporation in the nascent peptide chain (20 μM, Figure S2a). Then, we treated the MCF7 cells
with two different puromycin concentrations (20 and 100 μM)
for 2 h before adding 3PB (100 μM, 10 min) or 3PC (50 μM,
10 min). Probe-labeled proteins were coupled to a Cy3-azide reporter
tag using CuAAC chemistry, separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by in-gel
fluorescence scanning. We observed a 50% reduction in labeling after
puromycin treatment for both probes (Figures 2b and S2b), suggesting
that the labeling is related to protein synthesis activity. We confirmed
these results by coupling the 3PB-reacted probes to a biotin-azide
reporter tag instead of the fluorescent dye. After SDS-PAGE and membrane
staining with streptavidin conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase
(HRP), we observed specular effects (Figure S2b). In contrast to puromycin that causes ribosome disassembly, we
investigated if low doses of CHX, which is commonly used to transiently
freeze the assembled ribosomal complex along a coding sequence in
many gene expression profiles,21,22 could affect the labeling.
By monitoring the 3PB signal before and after cell treatment with
low (10 μM) doses of CHX, we did not observe detectable changes
in the intensities of the protein bands (Figure 2c,d), suggesting that short (5 min) CHX treatments
at a low concentration do not significantly affect labeling. On the
contrary, CHX in combination with puromycin hampers 3PB/3PC binding
probably affecting ribosome stability and the network of ribosome-associated
factors (Figures 2b
and S2c). Overall, these results confirm
that puromycin affects 3PB/3PC labeling.

Identification and Analysis of 3Px Cellular Protein Targets
To better understand the responses to inhibitory stresses and drug
treatments and to unravel the network of 3PB-target proteins, we used
two complementary approaches coupled to in-depth liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) studies. First, we performed an in-column
digestion of target proteins after CuAAC chemistry on an azide-agarose
resin. Second, we pulled down the 3PB-targets with an affinity method
based on 3PB-conjugated magnetic-beads, followed by in-gel and on-bead
digestion of the captured proteins (Figure S3a). Additionally, we used control beads (not functionalized with 3PB)
to account for any nonspecific signals. In total, 114 protein targets
were identified from the in-column digestion (called dataset 1, n = 4), 204 targets from the in-gel digestion (called dataset
2, n = 4), and 1085 from the on-bead digestion (called
dataset 3, n = 2, Figure 3a). To increase the stringency of our on-bead
digestion dataset, we performed an enrichment analysis using control
beads (n = 2) and identified 166 targets (Figure 3a). Six proteins
(ENO1, GRP78, eEF1A, PHGDH, KRT2, and HNRNPK) were present in all
three MS datasets and at least 2.5-fold more abundant compared to
the control beads, suggesting that they are major 3PB targets (Figures 3b and S3b). Interestingly, the detected proteins ENO1,
GRP78, eEF1A, PHGDH, and HNRNPK were shown to be associated with ribosomes23 and polysomal fractions24 in previous mass-spectrometry studies from mouse and human cells.
By using the less stringent filter (fold enrichment ≥ 1.3),
we identified proteins known to be involved in tRNAs selection and
ribosome elongation (eEF2 and eEF4G), as well as nascent protein folding
(HSP90AB1 and PPIA). Only one ribosomal protein (RPL18) was detected
in our analysis (fold enrichment of 3PB/Ctrl = 1.4) that is located
on the solvent-exposed large ribosomal subunit. These results suggest
that the 3PB probe is targeting a complex network of proteins involved
with ribosome activity. Among them, we confirm the binding of 3PC
for two of the proteins identified in the MS having ribosome-associated
functions. The first, a protein involved in RNA binding, ENO1;25 the second, a protein responsible for the folding
of the nascent peptide, GRP78.26−28 To confirm the binding to the
glycolytic enzyme ENO1 and to the chaperone protein GRP78, we performed
a selective pull-down assay of the 3PB targets using avidin magnetic
beads (Figure 3c).
A positive result was obtained for ENO1. For GRP78, we observed the
presence of two main protein bands in the input. The first above 72
kDa, and a less intense band between 55 and 72 kDa. GRP78 undergoes
post-transcriptional modifications (e.g., ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation),28,29 and two different isoforms of the protein have been described, one
that is 72 kDa and a shorter splice variant that is ∼62 kDa
(GRP78va).30 After performing the pull-down
assay, we observed the lower GRP78 band, but the upper band (which
was dominant in the input) was not detected. In contrast, an immunoblot
using an antibody against the parental Hsp-70 protein, which was not
enriched in the MS-data, did not show any signal, confirming the specificity
of the 3PC pull-down for ENO1 and GRP78. Hence, we silenced the GRP78
mRNA expression by introducing GRP78 siRNA into the MCF7 cells (Figure S3c,d). We observed a 50% reduction of
the 3PC signal after partial (60%) and transient GRP78 knockdown.
To additionally validate GRP78 as a target, we explored possible competition
at the ATP-binding site with structurally related adenosine-derived
inhibitors of GRP78.31−34 Because both 3PB and 3PC have adenosine-like moieties we would expect
a partial competition.

We incubated the MCF7 cells with VER-155008 for 1 h (100
μM)
prior to 3PB treatment (100 μM, 10 min). 3PB labeling was strikingly
reduced (5.7×) after VER-155008 incubation, suggesting its competitive
action with 3PB at the ATP-binding site (Figure S3e). This result confirms the GRP78 isoform as the 3PB target.
Coimmunoblotting with puromycin and GRP78 on the same membrane showed
a common band between 55 and 72 kDa (Figure S3f), which is consistent with the identification of GRP78 as a major
3PC/3PB target, while the total protein level of GRP78 did not show
evident changes upon serum starvation (i.e., 0.5% FBS, 18 h), suggesting
that 3PB/3PC binds a subpopulation of the total GRP78 protein.

Interactions
with Ribosomes
To confirm the relationships
among 3Px target proteins associated to the ER and active ribosomes,
we used four complementary approaches.

First, we reasoned that,
if the targets associate with ribosomes, we should observe differences
in the affinity of 3PB/3PC for the targets upon treatment with specific
inhibitors of the translational machinery. Among them, mTOR inhibitors
are known to change the ribosome-associated protein network, modifying
the phosphorylation state of downstream targets and ultimately affecting
protein synthesis. The eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2, protein
enriched in the LC–MS data set) is controlled through the mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The activity of eEF2 is regulated
by its phosphorylation, which impairs its interaction with the ribosome.35,36 eEF2 plays a crucial role in protein synthesis mediating ribosome
translocation during elongation. After treating the MCF7 cells with
pp242 (250 nM) and torin 2 (500 nM), we performed (i) confocal microscopy
of Cy3-labeled 3PB targets and (ii) a pull-down assay of the 3PB associated
complex. Fluorescence analysis showed a global reduction of the 3PB
signal upon treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors, confirming the engagement
of 3PB with the translational machinery (Figure 3d). We observed an enrichment of eEF2 and
the ribosomal protein S6 in the untreated 3PB pull-down with respect
to the pp242 and torin 2 treated samples, suggesting that we are indeed
targeting the ribosome complex (Figure S4a).

Second, we performed a subcellular fractionation coupled
to a high-salt
wash to separate the constitutive components of the ribosome from
associated factors, according to Francisco-Velilla et al.37 The results showed that 3PB-tagged protein are
associated with the ribosome fraction (Figure 4a), as is the elongation factor eEF2, suggesting
that the main target is transiently associated with ribosomes. This
result was confirmed by the detection of 3PB and 3PC along the polysomal
sedimentation profile (Figures 4b and S4b).

(soluble), R (ribosomes), FWS (salt-washed ribosomes), and RSW (pure
ribosomes) fractions from MCF7 cells after 3PB treatment. The ribosomal
protein S6 was used as a control for fractionation. Elongation factor
eEF2 was used as a control for RNA-binding protein interactions with
ribosomes. (b, Top) Sucrose gradient absorbance profile of MCF7 cells

and arsenite treated cells) of the VEGFA-mRNA from 3PB-beads (black

treatment.

Third, we took advantage of the
well-known signature (p235–p236)
of the phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein (p-S6), which is associated
with translationally active cells.38,39 We performed
a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis with an anti-puromycin antibody
to investigate the coprecipitation of phosphorylated ribosomal proteins
and the network of interacting partners. This analysis revealed the
presence of ribosomal protein p-S6 (p235–p236) and GRP78 (Figure 4c), confirming that
a structural component of the ribosome (S6) is an interacting partner.
The opposite co-IP with p-S6 showed a strong enrichment in the puromycin
signal with respect to the control, IgG, confirming its association
with assembled and productive ribosomes (Figure 4d). This result was supported by the evidence
of (i) a partial colocalization of RPL26 with the Cy3-labeled 3PB/3PC
target, as probed by confocal microscopy (Figure S5), and (ii) the sensitivity of 3PC-tagged proteins that cosediment
with the translational machinery to the ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid treatment (which is known to disassemble ribosomes) (Figure S6a). Moreover, additional co-IP showed
the enrichment of two proteins associated with ribosomes, PMK2 (Figure 4d) and Hsc-70 (Figure S6b). PMK2 is a glycolytic protein that
is known to be an RNA-binding protein for local translation of ER-destined
mRNA.23 Hsc-70 is a chaperone protein known
to be associated to the nascent polypeptide.40,41 All these results suggest that the interaction of 3PB/3PC-tag proteins
with productive ribosomes.

Lastly, we investigated the possibility
of using 3PB/3PC to purify
associated RNAs. HEK-293 cells were treated with a low concentration
(10 μM) of CHX for 5 min to avoid a ribosome run-off, and the
cell lysates were incubated with 3PB-conjugated magnetic beads (as
for the MS-analysis). Total RNA was extracted after being washed and
separated, and following quantification, it was found to be 5 times
(Figures 4e and S6c) more enriched than the control (nonfunctionalized
beads). Finally, we purified the total RNA from 3PB-beads, and we
measured by using qRT-PCR the relative abundance of the VEGF mRNA
under both high [10% FBS, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM)] and low (1 mM AsNaO2, 10% FBS, DMEM) performance
protein synthesis conditions. We observed a 2-fold enrichment of the
transcript on 3PB-functionalized beads under conditions of active
translation, with respect to the samples treated with arsenite. This
variation was specular to the total VEGF protein level (Figure 4f). Overall, these results
confirm the binding and separation of total RNA through a protein-mediated
ribosome interaction, an essential step for further 3PB/3PC-specific
RNA analyses.

Concluding Remarks
In contrast to
the standard puromycin, 3Px are molecules resembling
the 3′ end of the aminoacyl-tRNA, but cannot be transferred
to the growing chain. Because the 3′ end of the aminoacyl-tRNA
is exposed outside the A site of the ribosome, we tested if 3Px molecules
can bind the network of proteins involved in ribosome function and
activity. Starting from the observation that amino-modified puromycin
molecules functionalized with alkyne and diazirine reactive moieties
can penetrate cell membranes and bind cytoplasmic protein targets,
we demonstrated (i) their selective binding to ribosome-interacting
proteins and (ii) their use as sensors of global protein synthesis
activity. These findings are supported by three main pieces of evidence.
First, we observed that the position of the UV-active (diazirine)
moiety on the puromycin molecule is critical for binding. Although
all of the molecules synthesized resemble the terminal tRNA, modifications
affect their activity: when the UV-active group was placed on the
5′-OH of the ribose (3PA), the molecule was inactive; conversely,
when the functional group was on the 2′-OH (3PB) or on both
the 5′ and 2′-OH (3PC), the molecules possessed functional
activity. Second, a depression of translation (by puromycin treatment,
mTORC1 inhibitors, arsenite treatment, or serum starvation) significantly
reduced the affinity of the probes for their targets, suggesting that
the labeled protein is a distinctive member of the translation machinery.
Third, most of the targets identified are known ribosome-interacting
proteins.19,20 Finally, we demonstrated the binding of
3PB and 3PC to a network of proteins involved in ribosome function
and activity (e.g., eEF1A, ENO1, GRP78, and eEF2). In particular,
we validated the binding to ENO1, eEF2, and GRP78. ENO1 is a glycolytic
enzyme known to bind ribosomes,23 eukaryotic
tRNA42 and specific mRNAs.43 GRP78 is a protein that (i) controls protein synthesis
by regulating eIF2α phosphorylation,28,44 (ii) participates in nascent protein folding, and (iii) contributes
to the regulation of cell proliferation, PI3K/AKT signaling, and cell
viability.45,46 Finally, our results showed that
a fraction of the targets are not associated to ribosomes. Further
analysis is needed to accurately address the percentage of the 3PB/3PC
target associated with ribosomes in vivo. The ability of 3PB and 3PC
to sense translation activity (i.e., reduced binding upon depression
of protein synthesis), as well as the possibility of efficiently using
these probes to purify RNA, paves the way for the selective deep-sequencing
RNA analysis47,48 to better characterize ribosome
diversity.49 Overall, these compounds are
valuable tools for monitoring protein synthesis and studying translation
on the protein-exposed ribosome surface in research, industrial, and
medical fields.

Experimental Section
Syntheses of 3PA, 3PB,
and 3PC Compounds (Collectively Called
3Px)
A solution of BOC anhydride in CHCl3 was
added to a solution of diethanamine to provide a mono-NBOC derivative,
which was then reacted with an equimolar amount 3-(prop-2-ynyloxy)propanoic
acid. The clean product was deprotected, collected, and treated dropwise
with an equimolar amount of CDI in pyridine. Puromycin was then added
to the CDI-activated molecule at 100 °C for 7 h. The crude product
was evaporated under vacuum at 50 °C, affording brown oil, which
was extracted using different mixtures of AcOEt/water and a dichloromethane
(DCM)/water partitioning system. The organic phase was purified by
silica gel column chromatography with DCM/MeOH gradient elution to
obtain the pure puromycin-alkyne product. A (diaziridin-3-yl)methyl
carbonochloridate solution (155 mg, 1 molar equivalent) in 0.2 mL
of DCM was added dropwise over 30 min to a pyridine solution (7 mL)
of the puromycin-alkyne derivative (720 mg, 1 molar equivalent) stirred
at r.t. under N2. The mixture was kept at 0–5 °C;
after 2 further additions (2 molar equivalents) in 2 h, the reaction
was quenched by adding 10 mL of distilled water and 10 mL of AcOEt.
The obtained organic phase was dried over MgSO4, evaporated
at 40 °C to give the raw reaction products as oil, and finally
purified by silica gel column chromatography (35 g) with EtOAc/MeOH
gradient elution, collecting 120 fractions of 25 mL. Using LC–MS
and NMR analyses, fractions 13–30 were determined to contain
the bisaziridino derivative (3PC, 301 mg, 95% purity), fractions 57–90
the monoaziridino derivative (3PB, 52 mg, 96% purity), and fractions

Cells
and Reagents
Breast cancer cell line MCF7 (ATCC
catalog no. ATCC HTB-22) and HEK-293 (ATCC catalog no. ATCC CRL-1573)
cells were seeded on adherent plates and maintained at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 in DMEM with red phenol supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin. The cells were grown
to 80% confluence before lysis. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma.
For starvation, the cells at 80% confluence were incubated with DMEM-red
phenol supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100
units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin. The cells
were kept under starvation for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Arsenite treatment was performed using cells at 80% confluence,
with arsenite added at a final concentration of 1 mM for 1 h.

Preparation
of Cell Lysates
MCF7 and HEK-293 were seeded
at 1.5 × 106 cells per 100 mm dish and grown until
they reached 80% confluence. The cells were washed thrice with chilled
PBS containing 10 μg/mL cycloheximide and then harvested with
urea lysis buffer (200 mM Tris, 4% CHAPS, 1 M NaCl, and 8 M urea,
pH 8) or hypotonic cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
5 U/mL DNase I, 200 U/mL RNase inhibitor, and 10 μg/mL cycloheximide).
After hypotonic lysis, nuclei and cellular debris were removed by
two centrifugations at 18000g and 4 °C for 5
min. For quantification of the total absorbance value of the cell
lysate, the absorbance was measured (260 nm) using a Nanodrop ND-1000
UV–vis spectrophotometer before use or storage. The lysates
were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

Separation
Nucleus and Cytoplasm
The nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions were extracted from the MCF7 cells after cycloheximide (10
μg/mL, 5 min, 37 °C) and 3PB or 3PBis treatment (10 min,
37 °C), followed by irradiation under a UV lamp at 365 nm for
5 min (0.75 J/cm2). The cells lysates were prepared as
above, and the pellets containing the nuclei were washed 10 times
with PBS to remove cytoplasmic contaminants. Nuclei pellets were resuspended
in urea lysis buffer (200 mM Tris, 4% CHAPS, 1 M NaCl, and 8 M urea,
pH 8) and sonicated. The samples were quantified via Bradford Protein
assays, and equal amounts of the protein were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide
gels.

Cell Treatment with 3Px Probes
Reaction in Complete Media
MCF7 or HEK-293 cells were
grown to 80% confluence and treated or not treated with cycloheximide
(10 μg/mL, 5 min, 37 °C) and then the probe (10 min, 37
°C). The cells were then washed with cold PBS (containing 10
μg/mL cycloheximide), placed on ice, and irradiated under a
UV lamp (BLX-365, 5 × 8 W) at 365 nm for 5 min (0.75 J/cm2), followed by lysis with hypotonic cytoplasmic buffer.

Reaction in the Cell Lysate
HEK-293 or MCF7 cells were
treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/mL, 5 min). After hypotonic
lysis and precipitation of the nuclei and cellular debris by centrifugation
at 18000g and 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatant
was diluted to A260 = 1 a.u/mL with buffer
[10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 μg/mL cycloheximide,
and 10 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7
in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water]. 150 μL of the diluted
lysate was incubated with the reactive probe for 1 h in a 12-well
plate and then UV-irradiated (BLX-365) at 365 nm for 5 min (0.75 J/cm2).

Proteomic Analysis
HEK-293 cells
or cell lysates were
used for LC–MS analysis. In-column digestion. Purification
and digestion of the chemically bound 3PB target proteins were performed
using a Click Chemistry Capture Kit (Jena Bioscience, cat. no. CLK-1065)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data from four
independent samples were collected. In-gel digestion of gel slices.
Gel slices were digested using a ProGest digestion robot overnight.
Data from four independent samples were collected. On-bead digestion.
The beads were denatured in a urea buffer composed of urea (6 M) and
thiourea (2 M) and then reduced in dithiothreitol (DTT; 10 mM) at
37 °C and 1200 rpm for 1 h. Subsequently, the samples were alkylated
by adding IAA (at a 50 mM final concentration) in the dark for 1 h.
The magnetic beads were washed with tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB;
100 mM) for 4 times and mixed with the urea buffer. The samples were
digested with 1 μg of trypsin in 100 μL of 100 mM TEAB
overnight at 37 °C with agitation at 1400 rpm. The digested samples
were then purified using a Bravo Assay MAP. Data from two independent
3PB bead samples and two PEG bead samples were collected. Magnetic
beads were purchased from IMMAGINA Biotechnology (cat. no. 016-00-007-2-1)
and GE Healthcare (cat. no. 28-9857-38). LC–MS. After tryptic
digestion, the samples were resuspended in 40 μL of 2% acetonitrile
(ACN) and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC H2O and then
15 μL of each sample were separated by reversed-phase nanoflow
HPLC (column: EASY-Spray C18, 50 cm × 75 μm, Thermo RSLCnano;
gradient: 0–37 min, 4–30% B; 37–40 min, 30–40%
B; 40–45 min, 40–99% B; 45–50 min, 99% B; 50–80
min, 4% B; elution buffers: A = 0.1% FA in HPLC H2O; B
= 80% ACN and 0.1% FA in HPLC H2O) and directly analyzed
by a Q Exactive HF using: (i) the full ion scan mode m/z range of 350–1600 with a resolution of
60 000 (at m/z 200) and a
lock mass m/z = 445.12003 (in-gel
samples) and (ii) full ion scan mode m/z range 350–1500 with a resolution of 120 000 (at m/z 400) and a lock mass m/z = 445.12003 (on-bead samples). In-gel and in-column
MS/MS was performed using HCD with a resolution of 15 000 on
the top 15 ions with dynamic exclusion. On-bead MS/MS was performed
using CID on the most abundant ions with a cycle time of 3 s and dynamic
exclusion.

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were
prepared as described
above. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The samples were heated at 95
°C for 10 min in 6× Laemmli loading buffer and run on SDS-PAGE
in buffer containing 25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine (Bio-Rad, catalog
no. 4569033) at 120 V for 50 min. The membranes were blocked with
5% milk (Santa Cruz catalog no. SC-2325) in TBS-Tween (0.1% Tween)
for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody o.n. at 4 °C and then
washed in TBS-Tween (0.1%, TBST) two times for 10 min each. After
incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP, the blots
were washed three times in TBS-Tween (5 min each) and processed using
an ECL Plus detection kit (GE Healthcare, Amersham ECL Prime catalog
no. RPN2232) or the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
(Thermo Scientific) as instructed by their suppliers.

Polysome Profiling
Cytoplasmic lysates from MCF7 were
prepared as described previously (Lunelli et al., 2016).50 The cleared supernatants were loaded on a linear
15–50% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged in a SW41Ti rotor
(Beckman) for 1 h and 40 min at 180 000g at
4 °C in a Beckman Optima LE-80K Ultracentrifuge. After ultracentrifugation,
the gradients were fractionated in 1 mL volume fractions with continuous
monitoring absorbance at 254 nm using an ISCO UA-6 UV detector.

Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, the cells
were harvested with lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
0.2 U/mL, 5 U/mL DNAse I, 200 U/mL RNase inhibitor, and 10 μg/mL
cycloheximide with a protease inhibitor) and precleared with protein
A/G Magnetic Agarose beads (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 78609)
for 30 min at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were incubated with
specific antibodies against p-S6 (p235/p236), puromycin or the IgG
controls for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μg/mL cycloheximide).
Protein A/G magnetic agarose beads (50 μL, Thermo) were added
to the individual samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The
beads were then washed extensively with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 350 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 M DTT, 1% NP40, and
100 μg/mL cycloheximide) on ice. After the final wash, the beads
were transferred to new vials, boiled with 6× Laemmli loading
buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and resolved on SDS polyacrylamide
gels, followed by immunoblotting as described above.

Transient
Transfection with GRP78-siRNA
For the transient
transfection treatment, the MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of
3 × 106 cells in a 6-well plate and cultured for 24
h in the DMEM complete medium. When 70% confluence was reached, the
cells were transfected for 24 h with 20 nM GRP78-siRNA (Silencer Pre-designed
siRNA, Life Technology) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagents (Invitrogen)
in an Opti-MEM medium (1 mL, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Six hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced
with a fresh complete medium. The GenBank accession number of the
GRP78 sequence used to design the siRNA was nm_005347.4, and the siRNA
sequence was: sense-5′-GGAAGACAAUAGAGCUGUtt-3′.

SubCellular
Fractionation
The subcellular fractionation
protocol was adapted from Francisco-Velilla et al., 2016. Briefly,
the MCF7 cell lysates were prepared from two 10 cm culture dishes
with 300 μL of lysis buffer. Two consecutive centrifugations
for 10 min at 14 000 rpm and 4 °C were performed to remove
the cellular debris, nuclei, and mitochondria. The supernatant was
collected (S30 fraction) and then centrifuged at 95000 rpm (in a TLA100.2
rotor) to obtain the S100 supernatant and the R pellet (ribosomes
plus associated factors) fractions. The R pellet was resuspended in
200 μL of high-salt resuspension buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
500 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 290 mM sucrose),
loaded into a 40–20% discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged
at 4 °C and 95 000 rpm for 2 h using a TLA100.2 rotor.
The obtained pellet (pure ribosomes fraction, RSW) was resuspended,
and the supernatant, which contained the dissociated factors, was
collected (FSW).

Copper catalyzed “click” reaction
in the cell lysates and pull-down assays for target identification.

Cell lysates (0.35 mL) were incubated with CuSO4 (2.00
μmol), picolyl-PEG4-biotin (2.00 μmol) or picolyl-azide-sulfo-Cy3
(Jena Bioscience, 2.00 μmol), THPTA (10 μmol), and sodium
ascorbate (100 μmol) overnight a 4 °C. For the pull-down
experiments, the cell lysates were then incubated with 500 μL
of MAGAR-cN (IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.) for 1 h at RT.

Synthesis
and Purification of 3PB-Biotin and 3PC-Biotin
3PB or 3PC
(1.00 μmol), azide-PEG3-biotin (2.00
μmol), CuSO4 (2.00 μmol), THPTA (10 μmol),
and sodium ascorbate (100 μmol) were dissolved in 1:1 water–DMSO
(0.3 mL) and mixed overnight at room temperature. The final product
was extracted by CHCl3 with the aid of sonication, and
the product was obtained by solvent evaporation under vacuum. The
reaction was verified by MS and thin layer chromatography.

Bead
Functionalization with 3PB/3PC-Biotin
3PB or 3PC
was dissolved in 2 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (in DEPC water),
at a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated with the same volume
of MAGAR-cN beads for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with PBS
to remove unbound 3PB/3PC molecules.
