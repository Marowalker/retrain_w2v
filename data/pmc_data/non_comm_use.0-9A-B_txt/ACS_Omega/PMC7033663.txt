Pesticides are used in agriculture
for crop production enhancement
by controlling pests, but they have acute toxicological effects on
other life forms. Thus, it becomes imperative to detect their concentration
in food products in a fast and accurate manner. In this study, ZnO
nanoparticles (ZnO nps) have been used as optical sensors for the
detection of pesticide Aldicarb via a photoinduced electron transfer
(PET) route. ZnO nps were synthesized directly by calcining zinc acetate
at 450, 500, and 550 °C for 2 h. ZnO nps were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies
to study the phase, crystallinity, shape, morphology, absorbance,
and fluorescence of the prepared ZnO nps. XRD and Raman studies confirmed
the crystalline nature of ZnO nps. The average crystallite size obtained
was 13–20 nm from the XRD study. The SEM study confirmed spherical-shaped
ZnO nps with average sizes in the range of 70–150 nm. The maximum
absorbance was obtained in the 200–500 nm regions with a prominent
peak absorbance at 372 nm from UV–vis spectra. The corresponding
band gap for ZnO nps was calculated using Tauc’s plots and
was found to be 3.8, 3.67, and 3.45 eV for the 450, 500, and 550 °C
calcined samples, respectively. The fluorescence spectra showed an
increase in the intensity along with the increase in the size of ZnO
nps. The ZnO nps (samples calcined at 500 and 550 °C) exhibited
a response toward Aldicarb, owing to their pure phase and higher PL
intensity. Both the samples showed systematic detection of Aldicarb
in the range of 250 pM to 2 nM (500 °C) and 250 pM to 5 nM (550
°C). Among the various quenching mechanisms, PET was found to
be the dominant process for the detection of Aldicarb. This method
can be used for the detection of Aldicarb in real (food) samples using
a portable fluorimeter.

Introduction
Nanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO nps) is
a fascinating material due
to its unique properties. It exhibits high surface area; physical,
chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability; biocompatibility;
nontoxicity; optical transparency along with facile synthesis; higher
analytical performance; and enhanced sensitivity, with significant
stability at physiological pH.1−3 Besides these properties, it possesses
good electron transport, a large electrochemical coupling constant,
and radiation absorption properties making it a multifunctional material.4−6 It is classified as a II–VI semiconductor with a wide band
gap (3.0 eV) and has covalence that exists between the ionic and covalent
semiconductors.7,8 Also, it is a polar transparent
semiconductor with unparalleled piezoelectric and electron transport
properties.9−11 Therefore, ZnO nps is a promising material having
applications in diverse fields such as blue/UV optoelectronics, transparent
electronics, energy conversion, plasmonics, spintronics, and sensors.

ZnO crystals of various shapes in the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline
phase were synthesized by different synthesis methods with n-type
semiconducting nature. ZnO in the doped and undoped form has been
used for several applications such as in gas, chemical, and heavy
metal ion sensors.12−15 ZnO compounds formed with considerable covalent bonding between
Zn 3d and O 2p orbitals lead to wide-band-gap materials.16 ZnO of various shapes exhibits two luminescence
bands: one is located at the absorption edge, also called the edge
luminescence peak, that occurs at a shorter wavelength and the other
is a wide band at higher wavelengths, generally located in the green
wavelength range.17,18 The edge luminescence is excitonic,
and the green luminescence may be obtained for various reasons such
as impurities, Zn and O vacancies, and interstitial ions, but the
principal reason behind this is yet to understand.10,19 However, the luminescence properties can be used for optical sensors
and biosensors for the detection of desired analytes.

Pesticides
are generally used in crop production to control pests
and, thereby, to increase the quality and production of crops but,
at the same time, are harmful to animals and humankind.20 They cause respiratory diseases, nerve and bone
marrow disorders, infertility, and immunological disorders; some are
carcinogenic in nature. Mainly, organophosphates and carbamates are
widely used these days, as they have less toxicity and faster degradation
properties as compared to other groups.21 The Environmental Protection Agency has set limit levels for these
pesticides to overcome their toxic effects for which efficient detection
methods are required. The analytical methods presently used for the
detection of these pesticides, such as gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry, etc., have limited daily use, as they cannot be used
on-site due to their elaborated instrumentation and time-consuming
and costly process.22,23 Therefore, optical sensors/biosensors
are the best alternatives to overcome these limitations and to perform
rapid and cost-effective detection.24 Nowadays,
optical detection is grabbing more attention of researchers, as it
provides high precision and rapid detection with label-free methods.25,26 Among the other optical sensing mechanisms, fluorescence-based sensing
is more sensitive, as the intensity changes are measured directly
without any comparison with the reference.27 Aldicarb is a carbamate pesticide, generally used for controlling
a wide range of pests. Human beings are exposed to it through food
chains, and it is highly toxic.28 It is
observed that only a few reports have been published in the literature
for the optical sensing of Aldicarb. A chemidosimetric device based
on bimetallic donor–acceptor ensembles for the detection of
Aldicarb has been developed. The authors have reported a detection
range varying from 0.48 to 0.60 ppm.29 An
Eu(III)–3-carboxycoumarin interaction with Aldicarb and two
other pesticides was detected using fluorescence quenching and electrochemical
methods. The limit of detection in the fluorescence method was reported
to be in the μM range.30 A fluorescent
biosensor for the detection of carbamate pesticides has been developed
based on triggering of Hg2+ by an acetylcholinesterase
(AChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis product, and the limit obtained was 3.3
μg L–1.31 Thus,
there is a wide scope for developing optical sensors for Aldicarb
detection.

In the development of optical chemisensors, the mechanism
that
is accepted widely is the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism.32,33 The electron transfer takes place in these systems by either an
oxidative or a reductive process and is termed as a photoinduced oxidative/reductive
electron transfer process. PET can also be classified as a quenching
pathway. In this process, the electron transfer is mainly between
the ground and photoexcited states and involves a dynamic interaction
between the neighboring ground state and the photoexcited state species.
It is similar to an energy transfer quenching process, whereas in
PET, the excited state may be either an electron acceptor or a donor,
not as in the case of the energy transfer process, where the excited
state is entirely an energy donor. The energy transfer in this process
is realized by an electron exchange. This electron transfer leads
to the formation of intermediate states and radical ion pairs, and
the system relaxes to its ground state via charge recombination.34 The energies of the donor and acceptor are mainly
dictated by the redox potentials of the respective species.

In this study, ZnO nps were synthesized by one-step thermal treatment
of zinc acetate and were employed in a PET-based “turn-off”
(fluorescence quenching) sensor for the detection of Aldicarb. The
novelty of this study is that ZnO nps were synthesized using a relatively
simple, rapid, and inexpensive method by directly calcining zinc acetate
at 450, 500, and 550 °C.35 These ZnO
nps were utilized for the detection of Aldicarb with photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy without using any biomolecule. A broader detection
range was obtained from 250 pM to 2 nM with a lower detection limit
of 250 pM as compared to previously reported literature (Table 1). Here, the detailed
mechanism of the PET-based ZnO PL sensor for Aldicarb detection is
explained. The PET process was found to be the dominant process over
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and static-dynamic quenching
mechanisms. This study is the first report on PET-based optical sensing
of Aldicarb using ZnO nps.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization
Figure 1a shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) profile
of the ZnO nps calcined at 450, 500, and 550 °C. Narrow and sharp
peaks were observed, confirming the high crystallinity of the samples.
These peaks were indexed using the JCPDS card no. 897102 with a wurtzite
structure and space group P63mc.36,37 The Scherrer
formula was utilized to calculate the average crystallite size.38 The average crystallite sizes were found to
be 13, 17, and 20 nm for the 450, 500, and 550°C calcined samples,
respectively. There are some impurities found in the samples calcined
at 450 and 500 °C, as denoted by “*” in Figure 1a. However, there
are fewer impurities in the sample calcined at 500 °C as compared
to that calcined at 450 °C, whereas the sample calcined at 550
°C is highly pure without any impurities. To further confirm
the structure, surface defects, and oxygen vacancies in the material,
a Raman study was performed.

Figure 1 (a) XRD plot and (b) Raman plot of ZnO nps calcined
at (i) 450,
(ii) 500, and (iii) 550 °C.

Figure 1b shows
the Raman spectra of ZnO nps. Six peaks with wavenumbers at 326, 384,
435, 580, 978, and 1150 cm–1 were obtained in the
Raman spectra. In this structure, there was a significant peak centered
at around 435 cm–1.37 This peak corresponds to the wurtzite structure of ZnO with the
E2 high mode that is associated with the vibration of the
O and Zn atoms.39 The peak at 326 cm–1 corresponds to the second-order E2 mode,40 whereas the peak at 384 cm–1 corresponds to the second-order A1 (TO) mode.41 The peak at 580 cm–1 is attributed
to the E (LO) mode and represents oxygen deficiencies and surface
defects.42,43 The peak at 1060 cm–1 in
the sample calcined at 450 °C is due to the impurities present
in the sample. This study confirms that the sample calcined at 550
°C has a pure wurtzite phase, whereas the other two samples have
some minor impurities.

Shape and Morphology Study
A field-emission
scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) study was used to observe the morphology
of the ZnO nps. Figure 2 shows the FESEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX)
images of the ZnO nps, where spherical-shaped nanoparticles are observed.
The very small sized nanoparticles with a higher surface area lead
to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles. It is evident from the
image that the ZnO nps are of small size (<50 nm). As expected,
with the increase in calcination temperature (450, 500, and 550°C),
the average size of the nanoparticles increases (70, 80, and 150 nm).44 Also, EDAX was performed to study the elemental
composition of the three samples (ZnO at 550, 500, and 450 °C).
These results confirmed the presence of zinc (Zn), oxygen (O), and
carbon (C) in all samples. The presence of carbon (C) in all samples
is due to the carbon tape used for sample mounting.

and the corresponding EDAX images (right

Optical Study
Optical properties were studied using
UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure 3a). It can be seen from the figure that with
the increase in the temperature, and thereby particle size, the absorbance
intensity decreases. The band gap was measured using the Tauc plot,
as shown in the inset of Figure 3a. This plot gives the optical band gap, Eg, by extrapolating the plot of (αhν)2 versus hν onto the x-axis.23 The corresponding band gaps obtained
are 3.87; 3,72 and 3.35 eV for the 450, 500, and 550 °C calcined
samples, respectively. The absorption spectrum of ZnO shows a significant
sharp peak at 372 nm, which implies monodisperse ZnO nps in solution.45

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis absorbance spectra and the corresponding
band
gap plot (inset) and (b) PL spectra of the ZnO nps calcined at (i)
450, (ii) 500, and (iii) 550 °C.

Figure 3b shows
the photoluminescence spectra of the ZnO nps. There are two peaks
that appeared in the spectra of all three (450, 500, and 550 °C
calcined) samples, and the fluorescence increases with an increase
in calcination temperature. This is because the increased particle
size and decreased band gap of the material lead to an increase in
the number of de-excited electrons, which leads to an increase in
the electron–hole recombination.46,47 The peak at
a wavelength of 420 nm arises due to the band edge, and the second
split, broad peak at wavelengths of 486 and 506 nm arises due to surface
defects/deficiency of atoms/dangling bonds. The inset of Figure 3b shows the corresponding
band gaps of the three peaks.

Response Study of Aldicarb
Using PL Spectroscopy
As
observed from the above studies, the sample calcined at 450 °C
possesses impurities. Therefore, the response of ZnO nps as a function
of Aldicarb concentration was monitored using the 500 and 550 °C
calcined ZnO nps. Figure 4a,b shows the detection with ZnO nps calcined at 500 and 550
°C, respectively. From these two figures, it can be seen that
with the increase in the concentration of Aldicarb, the fluorescence
intensity is decreased. These results indicated that a slow interaction
occurred between the ZnO nps and the sulfur present in Aldicarb, which
led to fluorescence quenching that increased with increased Aldicarb
concentration.

Figure 4 PL spectra of Aldicarb detection by ZnO nps calcined at
(a) 500
°C and (b) 550°C.

Figure 5 shows the
corresponding calibration plots obtained from the PL spectra given
in Figure 4. It can
be seen that the linear detection range is slightly higher (250 pM
to 5 nM) for the ZnO nps calcined at 550 °C than that of the
500 °C calcined sample (250 pM to 2 nM), as shown in Figure 5b,a, respectively.
The increase in the upper detection limit of the 550 °C calcined
ZnO nps is due to the presence of higher surface defects and oxygen
vacancies. These defects and vacancies were confirmed from Raman spectra.

Figure 5 Calibration
plot for Aldicarb detection by ZnO nps calcined at
(a) 500 °C and (b) 550 °C.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of (a) ZnO-550 °C,
(b) Aldicarb, and (c) Aldicarb + ZnO-550 °C individually were
obtained after dispersion in deionized water (Figure 6) with water as the background. The peak
at 417 cm–148 in spectrum
(a) corresponds to the metal–oxygen (Zn–O) bond vibration.
The low-intensity peaks at 1220, 1270, and 1700 cm–1 represent the antisymmetric vibrations of the O–C–O
bond that may arise due to the impurities absorbed from the atmosphere,
which can be neglected.49 In spectrum (b)
of Aldicarb, the peaks corresponding to sulfoxide (1050 cm–1), C–O–C (1220 cm–1), N–H
(1640 cm–1), and the chain deformation vibrations
of C–H (450–480 cm–1) were observed.50 A small peak at 1227 cm–1 corresponds
to the OH in-plane bending vibration. When Aldicarb was mixed with
ZnO, spectrum (c) showed many changes as compared to the spectra of
(a) and (b). The intensity of the peak at 410 cm–1 was decreased. A wide hump appearing at 678 cm–1, corresponding to the characteristic Zn–S bond vibration,
confirms that the sulfur present in Aldicarb is bonded with Zn.51 An IR peak appeared at 875 cm–1 (CH2 out-of-plane wagging band), confirming deformed
Aldicarb. The intensity of the sulfoxide peak at 1050 cm–1 increased drastically, and a new peak corresponding to SO3H appeared at 1080 cm–1. The peak at 1220 cm–1 corresponding to C–O–C was still present
but with very low intensity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
FTIR studies confirmed the bond formation between Zn in ZnO and S
of Aldicarb.

°C
with Aldicarb.

The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of the ZnO nps were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 as given below 1   2  where EHOMO and ELUMO are
the energy levels of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO), respectively, Eoxidationonset and Ereductiononset are
the oxidation and reduction values, respectively, in the CV plot,
and 4.4 is an adjustment factor.52 The
LUMO value for ZnO-500 °C was −3.54 eV, whereas the HOMO
value was −5.83 eV. For ZnO-550 °C, the LUMO was −3.2
eV and HOMO was −6.5 eV. The band gap value for ZnO-550 °C
was calculated using eq 3(53) 3  CV characterization of ZnO-550
°C is
shown in Figure 7.
The band gap was found to be 3.2 eV for 500 °C calcined ZnO and
3 eV for 550 °C calcined ZnO. These band gaps are similar in
trend to the values obtained from UV–vis spectroscopy. Using
the HOMO and LUMO levels of ZnO, the band gap of ZnO has been proposed.

Figure 7 Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) plot of the ZnO nps calcined at 500 and
550 °C.

In the present case, the mechanism
for quenching has been explained
as oxidative photoinduced electron transfer, as shown in Figure 8. The HOMO and LUMO
energy levels of the ZnO nps were estimated using the CV plots to
be −6.2 and −3.0 eV, respectively.54 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Aldicarb were calculated
using the B3LYP method in the 6-311G basis set (Gaussian theoretical
analysis). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Aldicarb were obtained
to be −6.3 and −0.3 eV, respectively. The band gaps
of the ZnO nanoparticles and Aldicarb were 3.2 and 6.0 eV, respectively.
The HOMO energy levels of both ZnO nps and Aldicarb have nearly the
same value, whereas the LUMO energy levels of Aldicarb and ZnO nps
have a huge difference, as shown in the energy level diagram (Figure 8). When a mixture
of Aldicarb and ZnO was excited with 370 nm light, the electrons in
the ZnO nps jumped from the HOMO to the LUMO and formed two different
semi-occupied molecular orbital states, (SOMO)H and (SOMO)L, respectively. Further, (SOMO)L was occupied with
one electron (here subscripts H and L correspond to the HOMO and LUMO
levels, respectively). Now, (SOMO)H will act as an acceptor
and (SOMO)L will act as a stronger electron donor. When
the molecules of ZnO nps and Aldicarb come into contact, Aldicarb
is adsorbed on the surface of ZnO molecules, and the electron present
in the HOMO of Aldicarb will jump to (SOMO)H, as the energy
difference between the two levels is adequate for PET (Figure 8), leading to fluorescence
quenching. During this process, quenching takes place with heat dissipation.
In the present process, the phenomena of static quenching, dynamic
quenching, and the FRET quenching process were ruled out for the following
reasons: in the case of static quenching, the change in UV–vis
spectra takes place due to complex formation. The complex forms in
the ground state itself and, thereby, prevents fluorescence emission.55 It was found that there is no peak position
change observed in the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnO nps
with the addition of Aldicarb, indicating no complex formation in
the system. In FRET, dynamic quenching occurs, when the donor is in
the excited state. In the present case, the donor (Aldicarb) is not
in the excited state. Therefore, FRET is ruled out. Similarly, in
other dynamic quenching processes, the complex formation takes place
in the excited state leading to quenching, which is not there in the
present case.55

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
of the PET mechanism.

Figure 9 shows the
plot for TRF results for ZnO nps calcined at 500 and 550 °C.
Decays of ZnO and ZnO with Aldicarb were fitted by the bi-exponential
function 4  where a1 and a2 are the corresponding
amplitudes of decays τ1 and τ2.

Figure 9 Time-resolved
fluorescence plots for ZnO (550 °C) and ZnO
(550 °C) + Aldicarb (5 nM).

The calculated lifetimes of pure ZnO were 40 and 360 ps, whereas
those of ZnO with Aldicarb (5 nM) were 112 and 1920 ps, corresponding
to τ1 and τ2. These values are in
good agreement with the previously reported values for ZnO.56 ZnO with Aldicarb exhibited a longer radiative
lifetime than pure ZnO, which indicated that the photogenerated carriers
from ZnO diffused to a certain distance in the ZnO + Aldicarb mixture
before the radiative recombination, which occurred due to the trapped
e–. These trapped e–s are generated
from the process explained in the scheme given in Figure 8. In this process, the e– from the HOMO of ZnO was excited to (SOMO)L and stayed there for a few nanoseconds, and then, it was de-excited
to the HOMO of Aldicarb. The time taken to stay in (SOMO)L led to the increased decay time in ZnO + Aldicarb.

Figure 10 shows
the optical quenching of ZnO nps using the Aldicarb pesticide via
PET. Aldicarb has mainly three types of electron-donating groups,
namely, O (oxygen), S (sulfur), and N (nitrogen). However, S shows
better electron donor capability when compared to others, i.e., N
and O. Because of the soft acidic behavior of Zn (Zn lies between
hard and soft acids) and the soft basic character of S, the interaction
between Zn and S is more feasible, and the phenomenon is known as
a soft–soft acid–base interaction.57 The interaction of the S group (Aldicarb) and ZnO nps was
also confirmed by FTIR data and Gaussian HOMO–LUMO analysis
data. In FTIR data, the low-intensity peak corresponding to ZnS was
obtained at 678 cm–1 after the addition of Aldicarb
to the ZnO nps suspension. These experimental results were supported
by theoretical analysis carried out using Gaussian analysis. The HOMO–LUMO
electron cloud density of Aldicarb was generated theoretically using
the Gaussian software. It was found that the S atom (yellow) has a
higher electron density than O and N in the HOMO energy level; therefore,
it contributes more in the electron transfer to SOMO (Figure 9). In conclusion, S of Aldicarb
interacts with the ZnO nps to quench the fluorescence intensity after
the addition of Aldicarb, which is confirmed by both theoretical and
experimental results.

Figure 10 Mechanism for the detection of Aldicarb using ZnO nps.

Here, the method used for ZnO np synthesis is straightforward
and
reproducible without using very high calcination temperatures (900
°C). The detection of Aldicarb is performed using a relatively
easy and inexpensive method and without using any biomolecule. The
optical sensing of other pesticides, namely, aldrin, tetradifon, glyphosate,
and atrazine, was carried out using static and time-resolved fluorescence
methods using 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTES)-capped ZnO QDs,
and it was found that aldrin and tetradifon showed a better response
than the other two. The authors also reported the degradation of pesticides
through photocatalytic degradation.58 In
the literature, few reports are available on optical sensing of Aldicarb,
and the present work demonstrates the detection of a very low (250
pM) concentration of Aldicarb with a wide detection range (250 pM–2.0
nM). This wide detection range is obtained due to the interaction
between the S groups of Aldicarb and ZnO nps.

Table 1 shows a
comparison of Aldicarb detection using an optical sensor with earlier
literature.

Conclusions
Photoinduced electron
transfer (PET)-based detection of Aldicarb
was carried out using one-step-synthesized ZnO nps. ZnO nps were synthesized
from zinc acetate, and XRD results confirmed the formation of ZnO
at all three temperatures (450, 500, and 550 °C). The average
crystallite size was found to be in the range of 13–20 nm.
The pure wurtzite phase was obtained for the 550 °C calcined
sample. FESEM images showed ZnO np formation with an average size
in the range of 70–150 nm. The maximum UV absorbance was obtained
at 372 nm. The band gap calculated from the UV–vis spectra
(3.87–3.35 eV) was found to decrease with the increase in particle
size. The fluorescence intensity increased with the increase in the
calcination temperature. The band gap of ZnO nps was calculated using
cyclic voltammetry, whereas the band gap of Aldicarb was calculated
using Gaussian theoretical analysis. Aldicarb detection was obtained
in the range of 250 pM–2 nM and 250 pM–5 nM for the
500 and 550 °C samples, respectively. Among various quenching
mechanisms, PET was found to be the dominant process and has been
explained for optical sensing of Aldicarb using ZnO nps. Thus, we
have synthesized ZnO directly by using a relatively simple method
and have performed the sensing of Aldicarb without any biomolecule
using PL spectroscopy. This method can help in the detection of Aldicarb
in real (food) samples using a portable fluorimeter. There is a broad
scope for developing a commercial device for pesticide detection in
food samples.

Materials and Methods
Zinc acetate
dihydrate (22.7 mM) with high purity (>99% SRL) was
used as a precursor for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO nps).
The precursor was used as is without any further purification and
kept directly in an alumina crucible in a muffle furnace. Zinc acetate
was then calcined separately at three different temperatures of 450,
500, and 550 °C for 2 h each to obtain the white-colored powder
of ZnO nps. The obtained ZnO powders (ZnO nps) were used for further
characterization. Given below is the chemical reaction for the synthesis
of ZnO nanoparticles by directly calcining zinc acetate.  

Characterization
Techniques
X-ray diffraction (Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer
with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) operating at 40 kV and
15 mA) was used to study the crystal structure and phase of the three
samples. XRD spectra of the ZnO nps were obtained in the range of
20–80° at a scan rate of 3°/min with a step size
of 0.02°. A Raman study was carried out to further confirm the
phase and structure of the ZnO nps. Raman spectra were recorded using
an Enspectr R 532 in the range of 250–1250 cm–1 using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The shape, morphology,
and crystal structure of the material were studied using field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (MIRA II KMH-TESCAN) at 25 keV.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) (Bruker) was also performed
to conduct the elemental analysis of the samples attached to the FESEM
machine. Optical properties were studied using UV–visible absorption
spectroscopy (T90 + UV spectrometer, PG Instruments Ltd.) and photoluminescence
spectroscopy (Carry Eclipse spectrophotometer, Agilent Technologies).
The band gap was calculated using Tauc’s plots. Photoluminescence
(PL) studies were carried out to study the fluorescence properties
of ZnO nps as well as for the detection of Aldicarb. Fluorescence
lifetime decay was recorded in a commercial TCSPC setup FL-920 (Edinburgh
Instruments) by exciting the samples at 375 nm using a picosecond
diode laser (pulse width ∼60 ps). In the Aldicarb detection
study, the 500 and 550 °C samples were used owing to their excellent
crystallinity and pure phase. Both the samples showed good detection
of Aldicarb in the range of 250 pM–2 nM.
