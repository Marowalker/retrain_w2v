Manipulating the electron deficiency
and controlling the regioregularity
of π-conjugated polymers are important for the fine-tuning of
their electronic and electrochemical properties to make them suitable
for an organic solar cell. Here, we report such a molecular design
of unsymmetric diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based copolymers with different
aromatic side units of either thiophene (Th), pyridine (Py), or fluorobenzene
(FBz). The unsymmetric electron acceptors of Th–DPP–Py
and Th–DPP–FBz were polymerized with the electron donor
of two-dimensional benzobisthiophene (BDT-Th), affording two regiorandom
DPP copolymers. They exhibited contrasting molecular orbital levels
and bulk heterojunction morphology in methanofullerene-blended films,
leading to power conversion efficiencies of 3.75 and 0.18%, respectively.
We further synthesized a regioregular DPP copolymer via sandwiching
the centrosymmetric BDT-Th unit by two Th–DPP–Py units
in an axisymmetric manner. The extensive characterization through
morphology observation, X-ray diffraction, and space-charge-limited
current mobilities highlight the case-dependent positive/negative
effects of regioregularity and electron deficiency control.

Introduction
A polymer-fullerene
solar cell is a representative framework for
organic photovoltaics (OPV),1−5 which has recently evolved into molecular OPV,6−9 nonfullerene OPV,10−14 and ternary-blend OPV.15−19 In general, the development of novel π-conjugated polymers
is a matter of great importance for improving the power conversion
efficiency (PCE) in OPVs. The first- and second-milestone polymers
are highly crystalline regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)20−22 and narrow band gap polymers (NBPs) implemented through the intramolecular
charge-transfer transition of covalently bonded electron donor and
acceptor units, respectively.23−26 Owing to the great deal of freedom in the molecular
design, the NBP strategy has yielded various conjugated polymers for
OPV, of which electron-deficient units include isoindigo,27−30 thienopyrorodione,31−33 benzothiadiazole,34−37 and quinoxaline.38−41

Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)42−44 is a conventional red
dye and
has been used as the electron acceptor of NBPs. Generally, the DPP
unit has two symmetric thiophene (Th) or furan side units, which results
in a flat π-plane and high film crystallinity, leading to PCEs
in the range of 6–8% for polymer–fullerene OPVs.45−48 Meanwhile, unsymmetric DPP with Th and thienothiophene (TT)49 or pyridine (Py)50 has exhibited comparable PCEs of 6–8%. Other unsymmetric
electron acceptors are fluorinated thienothiophene of PTB7,25,51−53 benzothienoisoindigo,54−56 and pyridylthiadiazole
(PT).57−59 The electron donor of benzodithiophene (BDT) with
asymmetric side units is another example, which is unsymmetric in
the direction perpendicular to the polymer backbone.60,61 The unsymmetric structure and regiorandom configuration of copolymer
would lead to a good balance between solubility and crystallinity
and, in some cases, a highly preferential face-on orientation of the
polymer backbone, suitable for OPV devices.54,55 We have previously reported the unsymmetric DPP-based copolymers
bearing phenyl (Ph) and Th or TT, exhibiting PCEs of 2.3–2.4%,
which were higher than the symmetric analogue of Ph-DPP-Ph (0.45%).62 Such an unsymmetric DPP bears a half-distorted
π-plane due to the steric hindrance between the proton of Ph
and oxygen of DPP, which provides very good solubility (∼100
mg mL–1 in toluene). However, the polymer crystallinity
was drastically decreased in both pristine films and bulk heterojunction
(BHJ) films blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester (PCBM). Accordingly, the increase in the π-plane
coplanarity, tuning of electron deficiency (and intramolecular electronegative
interaction), and/or the control of regioregularity are expected to
be the next rational modifications of unsymmetric DPP to improve the
crystallinity and PCE.

In this study, we report the synthesis
and characterization of
the unsymmetric Th–DPP–Ar, where Ar is either Py or
fluorobenzene (FBz). The Th–DPP–Py unit displayed a
more planar structure than the previous counterpart Th–DPP–Ph
because the C–H unit, which causes a significant steric hindrance,
was replaced by a less steric nitrogen atom. On the other hand, the
C–F unit of Th–DPP–FBz was introduced to produce
deepening of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and increasing
of the open-circuit voltage (VOC); meanwhile,
the fluorine atom, larger than hydrogen, might lead to a more twisted
structure. Because the improved PCE of 3.75% was achieved for the
regiorandom NBP, composed of Th–DPP–Py as the electron
acceptor and two-dimensional benzobisthiophene appending alkylthiophene
side units (BDT-Th)63,64 as the electron donor, we synthesized
a regioregular DPP copolymer via sandwiching the centrosymmetric BDT-Th
unit by two Th–DPP–Py units in an axisymmetric manner.
Although a moderate space-charge-limited current (SCLC) hole mobility
of 4.1 × 10–4 cm2 (V s)−1 was found in the pristine film of regioregular DPP, the PCE of BHJ-OPV
decreased to 2.56%. We performed a comparative study on the morphology,
molecular packing, and charge carrier mobility for these copolymers
and clarified the reason for the increased/decreased PCEs.

Results
and Discussion
Unsymmetric and regiorandom copolymers of
PPy and PFBz were synthesized
via Stille cross-coupling of a bis-stannylated BDT-Th with the bis-brominated
Th–DPP–Py and Th–DPP–FBz, respectively,
as shown in Figure 1. The chemical structure of PBz is also provided, which has unsymmetric
Ph and Th side units and serves as the reference for PPy and PFBz.
Among these regiorandom copolymers, PPy exhibited the highest PCE
(vide infra). Therefore, we examined the regioregularity control for
the Th–DPP–Py unit. In fact, two types of molecular
designs are possible for regioregular polymers, as shown in Figure 2a, where the unsymmetric
unit is positioned in the same direction (type I), while a pair of
unsymmetric units is repeated in alternating fashion (type II).65 Regioregular P3HT, which has a head-to-tail
regioregularity (typically >90%), is categorized into type I, which
is synthesized by, e.g., Grignard metathesis method (GRIM), based
on the reactivity difference in the hydrogen atoms at the 2 and 5
positions of 3-alkylthiophene.20,66 Another type I polymer
composed of cyclopentadithiophene and PT reported by Bazan et al.
also exploits the difference in the reactivity of bromine atoms of
an unsymmetric PT unit.57 For the same
reason, fluorinated thienothiophene53 is
applicable to type I regioregular polymers, in which the preparation
of monostannylated and monobrominated monomer is essential for the
subsequent Stille cross-coupling. However, such an unsymmetrically
labeled monomer is difficult for our polymer to synthesize because
of the large size of the acceptor that weakens the difference in proton
(or bromine) reactivity. Therefore, one bromine atom was introduced
at the pyridine unit of the unsymmetric DPP by using a monobrominated
compound (5-bromo-2-cyanopyridine) as the starting chemical, which
enables the synthesis of a type II regioregular polymer (Supporting Information). The chemical structure
of the resultant polymer RR-PPy and its synthetic scheme are shown
in Figure 2b. It should
be noted that our DPP unit that encompasses unsymmetry and regioregularity
is large in size, which is in contrast to the other type II polymers
based on small-sized PT57,58 and thienothiophene.67−71

Figure 3a shows
the photoabsorption spectra of PPy, PFBz, and RR-PPy in diluted chlorobenzene
solutions and films. Although all the polymers exhibited mostly unchanged
absorption maxima, the shoulder peaks in the longer-wavelength region
were observed in PPy and RR-PPy. This is suggestive of their more
extensive conjugation and higher crystallinities, as compared with
PFBz. Figure 3b displays
the electrochemical properties of the polymers, including HOMO levels,
as evaluated using photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) and the
band gap energy (Eg) estimated from the
onset of the photoabsorption spectra in the films (Figure S1). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
levels were calculated by adding Eg to
the HOMO levels. PFBz exhibited the widest Eg of 1.80 eV along with the deepest HOMO level (−5.52
eV) and the shallowest LUMO level (−3.72 eV) because of the
electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atom. The increased Eg of PFBz compared with the nonfluorinated analogue
(PBz, Eg = 1.67 eV) was further rationalized
by the more twisted backbone structure of PFBz, as calculated by density
functional theory (DFT), shown in Figure 3c. The dihedral angle between the DPP and
fluorinated Ph is 39°, which is larger than that of PBz (25°).62 On the other hand, PPy and RR-PPy showed mostly
identical electrochemical properties, i.e., HOMO at −5.43 and
−5.47 eV and Eg of 1.62 and 1.63
eV, respectively, indicating that the regioregularity did not significantly
impact the energetics of intramolecular charge transfer interaction,
similar to the one reported for regioregular type II polymers.57,67−71 These Eg values are 0.4–0.5 eV
narrower than that of the reference PBz.62 In addition to the increased electron-accepting ability of pyridine,
a narrow Eg is supported by a more coplanar
backbone (dihedral angle ∼2°; Figure 3c) and the appearance of a distinct shoulder
peak (Figure 3a). The
weight-averaged molecular weights (Mw)
and polydispersity indices (PDI) of the polymers were characterized
by size exclusion chromatography (Figure S2) and showed moderate values (Mw = 10
kg mol–1 for PFBz, 80 kg mol–1 for PPy, and 83 kg mol–1 for RR-PPy). These electrochemical
and polymeric properties are listed in Table 1.

The inverted-type OPV devices (indium
tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active
layer/MoOx/Ag) were fabricated from the
chlorobenzene solutions with 3 vol % 1,8-diiodooctane as the solvent
additive. We surveyed the processing conditions including thermal
annealing (120 °C for 10 min) and the blend ratios (copolymer/PCBM
= 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, and 1:3) (Tables S1).
The optimized PFBz:PCBM device showed a PCE of 0.18% (average: 0.15%),
which considerably suffered from the small short-circuit current density
(JSC = 0.85 mA cm–2)
and fill factor (FF = 0.29) (Figure 4a and Table 2). In stark contrast, PPy:PCBM exhibited a PCE of 3.75% (average:
3.61%), which is a great improvement compared with the reference (2.30%
for the PBz:PCBM).62 The increased JSC, owing to the wide photoabsorption up to
∼800 nm, and the upward shift in external quantum efficiency
(EQE; Figure 4b) are
responsible for the improved PCE, although the FF is still not high
(0.45). Regretfully, RR-PPy:PCBM resulted in a lower PCE of 2.56%
(average: 2.28%) than PPy, mainly caused by the decrease in JSC and EQE. The VOC values (0.72, 0.78, and 0.81 V for PFBz, RR-PPy, and PPy, respectively)
are in a reverse order of their HOMO levels (−5.52, −5.47,
and −5.43 eV for PFBz, RR-PPy, and PPy, respectively). This
discrepancy is due to the low FF (less than 0.45) associated with
the large series resistance, as seen from the slight slopes of the J–V curves in Figure 4a.

In previous reports,
all of the regioregular type II polymers showed
an improved PCE compared with the regiorandom analogues.57,67−71 Despite the limited number of cases, we speculate that the positive
effect of regioregularity control (improvement in crystallinity) is
deteriorated for the long-shaped repeating unit, as in our RR-PPy.
This is because the acceptor unit of previous regioregular polymers
is one unsymmetric aromatic ring in the conjugation direction. The
PCE values among the four polymers (in the order of low PFBz, PBz,
RR-PPy, and high PPy) indicated a good agreement with the transient
photoconductivity intensities of blend films measured by Xe-flash
TRMC (Figure S3),72 suggesting that the crystallinity and free charge-carrier generation73,74 in RR-PPy are lower than those in regiorandom PPy.

Surface
morphologies of pristine and blend films were observed
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Figure 5. While PPy and RR-PPy displayed moderate
BHJ morphology without large aggregations, PFBz showed unusual pin-holes
(black spots in the height image), which is in contrast to the smooth
surface of nonfluorinated PBz:PCBM film (Figure 5b). Such an anomaly was not observed in pristine
polymer films (Figure 5a). Fluorination of NBP is a rational design for the fine-tuning
of HOMO/LUMO levels25,26 and facilitating the electron
transfer to n-type semiconductor at the p/n interface owing to the
more localized LUMO as opposed to nonfluorinated analogue.75 Conversely, the large electronegativity and
hydrophobic nature of fluorine atom may lead to a coarse BHJ morphology,
increased amorphous nature, and/or change in polymer orientation.56 Although a reason for the pin-hole formation
in the PFBz:PCBM film is unclear, fluorination of our DPP polymers
caused a negative effect on the film characteristics. The relatively
low Mw of PFBz (10 kg mol–1) may be another reason for the low quality of the film. We could
not obtain a high Mw, possibly due to
the low reactivity of FBz, although we examined synthetic conditions
(temperature and solvents).

films and (b) copolymer/PCBM
blend films. The left, center, and right panels correspond to PPy,
PFBz, and RR-PPy, respectively.

The two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD)
image of PFBz pristine film revealed its amorphous nature without
π–π stacking diffraction and orientation (Figures 6a,b). In contrast,
PPy and RR-PPy pristine films exhibited a weak but clear π–π
stacking diffraction in the out-of-plane direction, indicative of
their more crystalline and face-on features, as compared with PFBz.
The π–π stacking distance (dπ) and coherence length (Lπ) calculated using the Scherrer’s relation were 0.384 and
1.2 nm for PPy and 0.391 and 1.0 nm for RR-PPy, respectively (Table 1). These dπ values are larger than those of the crystalline
polymers (ca. 0.35–0.37 nm);55 thus,
even PPy and RR-PPy are categorized into low-crystalline and nonoriented
polymers. The interlamellar distance (dIL) and its coherence length (LIL) did
not vary significantly among the polymers (dIL = 1.62–1.73 nm and LIL = 3.5–3.9 nm), which was also confirmed by the one-dimensional
XRD measurements (dIL = 1.59–1.62
nm and LIL = 3.1–3.4 nm in Figure S4). Notably, the copolymer:PCBM blend
films turned to almost completely amorphous features without any orientation,
as shown in Figure 6c,d. This result is consistent with the insufficient PCE values of
OPV devices (0.18–3.75%) and SCLC mobilities (vide infra).

copolymer films. (c) 2D-GIXRD images and (d) their diffraction profiles

in-plane (IP, blue line) profiles are shown in (b) and (d), respectively.
The left, center, and right panels correspond to PPy, PFBz, and RR-PPy,
respectively.

SCLC hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were evaluated for
the device-optimized BHJ films (J–V curves are shown in Figure S5). As listed in Table 2, the values of μh ((2.3–9.1)
× 10–6 cm2 (V s)−1) and μe ((0.98–8.5) × 10–4 cm2 (V s)−1) are roughly correlated
with the PCE values. The mobility balance (μh μe–1) was not a good explainable parameter;
however, the low μh μe–1 of less than 0.03 could be one of the reasons for the low FF (<0.45)
observed in all the devices. The correlation of μh vs PCE was degraded when the reference PBz was included (Figure S6). On the contrary, a good correlation
between μe and PCE was found even in the presence
of PBz, suggesting that the predominant factor of PCE is μe, similar to the case of our previous regiorandom DPP polymers.62 Both μh and μe in the blend films were decreased for RR-PPy compared with PPy;
however, it should be noted that μh of pristine RR-PPy
film (2.1 × 10–4 cm2 (V s)−1) is approximately 2-fold of PPy (9.3 × 10–5 cm2 (V s)−1) and 70-fold of PFBz (3.0
× 10–6 cm2 (V s)−1) (Table 1 and Figure S7). At least in the pristine film, regioregularity
control is beneficial to the improvement in hole mobility. Thus, the
unsatisfactory result in RR-PPy OPV is due to the decrease in μh when PCBM is blended in, which is concomitant with the low
μe caused by the low crystallinity of the counter
phase of the p-type RR-PPy.

Conclusions
We synthesized and characterized
unsymmetric, regiorandom DPP polymers
(PPy and PFBz), whose electron deficiencies were modulated by introducing
nitrogen or fluorine into the Ph part of the reference (PBz). The
PCE of PPy was improved to 3.75% compared to that of PBz (2.30%),
while that of PFBz was as low as 0.18% because of its considerably
low crystallinity and low μh and μe. The type II regioregular DDP polymer of RR-PPy exhibited a decreased
PCE of 2.56%, whereby the PCEs of these polymer:PCBM OPVs were likely
governed by μe. Although μh was
the highest for pristine RR-PPy, it was drastically decreased in the
PCBM-blend film because of the degradation in crystallinity and orientation.
With regards to polymer design, this study suggests that the regioregularity
control does not necessarily lead to improved OPV performance, which
is possibly attributable to cases of large-sized unsymmetric acceptors.

Experimental
Section
General Measurement
Steady-state photoabsorption spectra
were recorded using a Jasco V-570 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The molecular weight (weight-averaged: Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers were measured using
the size exclusion chromatography (gel permeation chromatography:
GPC, a Shimadzu Corp. LC-20AT/CBM-20A/CTO-20A/ SPD-M20A) with polystyrene
standards in hot chloroform (40 °C) as an eluent. Photoelectron
yield spectroscopy (PYS) of the polymer films on indium–tin–oxide
(ITO) glass was performed using Bunko Keiki BIP-KV2016K. 2D-GIXD experiments
were performed on the beam line BL46XU at the SPring-8 (12.39 keV,
λ = 1 Å X-ray). The 2D-GIXD patterns were monitored with
a 2D image detector (Pilatus 300 K). Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
was performed using a Bruker Innova AFM microscope. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using a Netzsch DSC204F1 Phoenix
differential scanning calorimeter under N2 at 10 °C
min–1 (sample weight ∼2 mg). Thicknesses
of the polymer and blend films were measured using a Bruker Dektak
XT surface profiler. Xe-flash time-resolved microwave conductivity
(TRMC) was performed for the polymer:PCBM films prepared on a quartz
substrate. The microwave frequency and excitation light were ∼9
GHz and a white light from a Xe-lamp (pulse width ∼ 10 μs).
The details are in the reference.70

Synthesis
of Polymers
Symmetric and unsymmetric DPP
monomers were synthesized according to the references.49,50,62 The synthetic details including
the NMR, elementary analysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight massspectrometry are provided in the Supporting Information. The polymers (PPy, PFBz,
and RR-PPy) were synthesized by Stille coupling with the (PPh3)4Pd catalyst from the Br-DPP-Br monomer and (Me3Sn)-(BDT-Th)-(SnMe3) monomer. The yields were 62%
for PPy, 47% for PFB, and 62% for RR-PPy.

OPV
After cleaning
an ITO/glass substrate, a ZnO layer
was fabricated by spin-coating with a ZnO precursor solution (0.1
g mL–1 zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g mL–1 ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol) followed by annealing
on a hot plate at 200 °C for 30 min. On top of the ZnO layer,
a BHJ layer was spin-cast in a nitrogen glovebox. Subsequently, an
anode (10 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag) was deposited
through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber.
The device configuration was an ITO (120–160 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/BHJ/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) with an active area of
7.1 mm2. The solar cell characteristics were measured using
an ADCMT Corp., 6241A source meter unit under air mass 1.5 G solar
illumination at 100 mW cm–2 (1 sun, monitored by
a calibrated standard cell, Bunko Keiki SM-250KD) from a 300 W solar
simulator (SAN-EI Corp., XES-301S). The EQE spectra were recorded
using a Bunko Keiki model BS-520BK equipped with a Keithley model
2401 source meter. The monochromatic light power for EQE measurements
was calibrated by a silicon photovoltaic cell of a Bunko Keiki model
S1337-1010BQ.

SCLC
The SCLC devices were fabricated
in the same manner
as the OPV devices. Hole-only device was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer
(100–200 nm)/Au and electron only device was Al/active layer
(∼200 nm)/LiF/Al. The mobility was determined by fitting a
current density–voltage curve by the Mott–Gurney law, J = 9ε0εrμV2(8L3)−1, where ε0, εr, μ, V, and L are the permittivity of the free
space, the dielectric constant of the material, the mobility, the
voltage drop across the device, and the thickness of the active layer,
respectively.
