Co-doped
MoS2 nanosheets have been synthesized through
the hydrothermal reaction of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and hydrazine
in the presence of cobalt acetate. These nanosheets exhibit a dominant
metallic 1T phase with cobalt ion-activated defective basal planes
and S-edges. In addition, the nanosheets are dispersible in polar
solvents like water and methanol. With increased active sites, Co-doped
MoS2 nanosheets exhibit exceptional catalytic activity
in the reduction of nitroarenes by NaBH4 with impressive
turnover frequencies of 8.4, 3.2, and 20.2 min–1 for 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroaniline, and nitrobenzene, respectively.
The catalyst is magnetic, enabling its easy separation from the reaction
mixture, thus making its recycling and reusability simple and efficient.
The enhanced catalytic activity of the Co-doped 1T MoS2 nanosheets in comparison to that of undoped 1T MoS2 nanosheets
suggests that incorporation of cobalt ions in the MoS2 lattice
is the major reason for the efficiency of the catalyst. The dopant,
Co, plays a dual role. In addition to providing active sites where
electron transfer is assisted through redox cycling, it renders the
nanosheets magnetic, enabling their easy removal from the reaction
mixture.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional
(2D) MoS2 nanosheets1 have garnered
interest as a potential noble-metal-free
catalyst for the electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water2−4 and hydrodesulfurization of petroleum.5,6 Theoretical
and experimental studies indicate that the catalytic activity of the
thermodynamically stable 2H polymorph of MoS2 is associated
with its metallic edges, whereas its semiconducting basal plane is
catalytically inert.2,4

In this context, nanostructures
of MoS2, amorphous7−9/crystalline,10−13 and vertically aligned structures14,15 have been
explored to maximize the number of active edge sites. MoS2 is also hybridized with conducting/semiconducting/magnetic materials
(graphene15−19/CoSe220/CoS21−24/CdS25,26/Fe3O427) to enhance
the catalytic activity through synergetic coupling effects. Metastable,
intrinsically metallic, octahedral 1T MoS2 obtained through
exfoliation of trigonal prismatic 2H MoS2 has proven to
be an excellent catalyst for H2 evolution reactions as
the 1T phase facilitates electrode kinetics by increasing the electric
conductivity and proliferation of the catalytic active sites.28−30 Introducing transition metal ions (Co, Ni, Fe) into the MoS2 matrix has been the classic route to maximize the catalytic
activity of MoS2, as the doped ions alter the electronic
properties at the coordinatively unsaturated catalytic S-edges.10,31,32 These strategies have been designed,
largely, to either optimize the density of active edge sites by reducing
the dimensions along the z direction or xy direction (nanostructures)33 or increase
the conductivity by stabilizing the 1T MoS2 polytype.19,28,29 The question is, would it be
possible to tune both the structural features and electronic properties
simultaneously to increase the catalytic active sites? Doping 2H MoS2 with Co has been shown to increase its catalytic efficiency
through increased active sites in the basal planes in addition to
edges.34 It would be of interest to prepare
Co-doped 1T MoS2 because in addition to all of the above
effects, there would be increased conductivity.

One of the standard
reactions to test the electron transfer catalytic
action is the reduction of nitroarenes by NaBH4. Nitroarenes,
with aromatic rings associated with H-bonding −NH2 and −OH groups, enable the reduction to be carried out in
water, making it a green reaction. This study demonstrates a single-step
robust strategy to synthesizing 1T Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets.
With increased active sites, Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets exhibit
exceptional catalytic activity in the reduction of nitroarenes. The
observed turnover frequency (TOF) is far superior in comparison to
that of other MoS2 architectures and noble-metal-based
catalysts, reported so far.

2 Results and Discussion
The XRD pattern of as-prepared Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets
(Figure 1A,a) exhibits
a broad 002 reflection at 11.0 Å, indicating the presence of
guest species in the interlayer.35,36 The guest
entity could possibly be NH3/NH4+ ions released as byproducts of hydrazine used as a reductant in
the hydrothermal reaction.

Figure 1 (A) XRD patterns of Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets (a) as-prepared
and (b) treated with 1 N HCl and of (c) MoS2 prepared in
the absence of cobalt. (B) Raman spectrum of Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets in comparison with bulk MoS2.

On treating Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets
with 1 N HCl solution,
the 002 reflection (Figure 1A,b) disappears, indicating deintercalation of the guest species.
However, the low intensity of the 002 reflection or its absence (Figure 1A,a,b) suggests that
Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets are poorly ordered along the stacking
direction and comprise largely exfoliated layers. The asymmetric 2D
reflections at 2θ = 33 and 57° reveal the presence of stacking
faults37,38 within the few-layered Co-doped MoS2. The undoped MoS2 is also poorly ordered and exhibits
increased basal spacing due to NH3/NH4+ intercalation (Figure 1A,c).

The Raman spectrum of Co-doped MoS2 (Figure 1B) exhibits the in-plane
E2g (380 cm–1) and out-of-plane A1g (406 cm–1) Mo–S vibration modes,
characteristic
of the MoS2 layered structure. An additional peak at 220
cm–1 in Figure S1 (Supporting Information, SI) indicates the presence
of 1T polytype. Increased full width at half-maximum and the shift
in the A1g and E2g modes of Co-doped MoS2 in comparison to those of bulk MoS2 clearly indicate
softening of A1g and E2g modes and phonon confinement
that is expected for mono- to few-layer MS2, thus indicating
that the Co-doped MoS2 comprises mono to few layers.39,40

The chemical composition of the Co-doped MoS2 was
further
probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Mo 3d and S 2p spectra
(Figure 2a,b; Table 1) correspond to
Mo4+ and S2– of the 1T polytype of MoS2. A small proportion of the 2H polytype coexists with the
1T phase.41 The N 1s spectrum (Figure 2c; Table 1) indicates the presence of
NH3 and NH4+ ions, which are accommodated
in the interlayer of MoS2 nanosheets, as suggested by the
XRD pattern (Figure 1a).35 The core-level Co 2p spectra (Figure 2d; Table 1) confirm the presence of Co2+ species. The XRD pattern (Figure 1a) and the XPS Co 2p spectra confirm the
absence of CoS2 and CoMo2S4. The
binding energy of 779.2 eV is close to what has been observed for
CoMo2S4, suggesting that Co2+ substitutes
Mo atoms along the {002} or the S-edge planes of MoS2.
The atomic percentages of Co, Mo, S, and N are 4.68, 24.66, 59.38,
and 11.27, respectively, leading to a chemical composition of Co0.16Mo0.83S2(NH3)0.38.

To understand the nature of the chemical
environment of Co2+, the Co-doped MoS2 was treated
with 1 N HCl when
the intercalated or undoped Co2+ species, if any, was expected
to be leached out. Cobalt estimation of the leachate showed that only
about 30% of the cobalt could be leached out by acid. This was further
confirmed by the atomic percentages (Co-3.36, Mo-27.11, S-69.54) in
the acid-leached Co-doped MoS2 arrived at from XPS data.
The composition of the acid-leached sample is Co0.1Mo0.78S2. The XPS spectra of acid-treated Co-doped
MoS2 (SI, Figure S2) indicate
that whereas the nitrogen-containing species, NH3 and NH4+ ions, are absent, Co2+ and 1T phase
of MoS2 nanosheets are retained. These further suggest
that Co2+ is present in the MoS2 lattice. Hydrothermally
synthesized MoS2 has been shown to have a defective basal
plane as well as unsaturated S-edges.42 Recent studies by Liu et al.34 demonstrate
that Co2+ is doped at S vacancies in basal planes as well
as at the unsaturated S-edges.

The magnetic hysteresis loop
measured on the powder sample indicates
a weak ferromagnetic behavior (Figure 3). The saturation magnetization (MS) at 300 K of Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets is
0.0029 emu g–1, which is comparable to that of exfoliated
1T MoS2 reported in the literature.43 Because our control 1T MoS2 is nonmagnetic,
it is fair to assume that the magnetism in Co-doped MoS2 arises as a consequence of doping. The magnetism in monolayer MoS2 and its doped analogues depends on the nature of edges, type
of edge defects, lattice strain, and the dopant concentration. Theoretical
calculations by Wang et al.44 reveal that
low concentrations of 4 and 6% of Co2+ doping in the Mo
vacant sites of the basal planes result in stable magnetic moments
at room temperature. Yun et al.45 and Saab
et al.46 also reported tuning of electronic
and magnetic properties due to doping of metal ions in the MoS2 lattice. The very low MS observed
for Co-doped MoS2 suggests that the weak ferromagnetism
here originates from the strain in the layer rather than from ordering
of Co2+ ions. Co-doped MoS2 (Figure 3) as well as the acid-leached
product is weakly magnetic, suggesting that Co2+ ions are
doped in the MoS2 layers. In addition, the presence of
Co2+ in the MoS2 lattice could be the reason
for the retention of metastable 1T structure even after deintercalation
of the intercalants (SI, Figure S2). All
of these results indicate that Co2+ is possibly doped in
the basal plane and S-edge planes of MoS2 layers.

K.

Clusters of layers are observed
in the SEM image (Figure 4a) of as-synthesized Co-doped
MoS2. The bright-field transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image (Figure 4b) indicates that the transparent layers are few-layer thick and
few hundred nanometers in lateral dimensions. The HRTEM image (Figure 4c) shows lattice
fringes with a spacing of 1.1 nm, which correlates with the basal
spacing observed in the XRD pattern (Figure 1a), suggesting the presence of intercalants.
The HRTEM image in Figure 4d clearly shows that the layers are crystalline, exhibiting
(100) lattice planes. Except for the circled regions representing
the 2H phase, the layers largely exist as the 1T polytype.43

Figure 5 schematically
depicts the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes. Catalytic performance
of Co-doped MoS2 in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP)
in water is summarized in Figure 6a,d–f. UV–visible absorption spectra
(Figure 6a) of the
reaction mixture indicate that 4-nitrophenol converts to 4-aminophenol
within 7 min. The absorption peak at 400 nm is due to the nitro phenolate
ion, and the intensity of this peak decreases with time and disappears
completely at 7 min. Peaks at 235 and 308 nm emerge due to the formation
of amino phenolate, and their intensities increase with time. The
log (absorbance) versus time plot (Figure 6e) is linear (R2 = 0.979), indicating a pseudo-first-order kinetics47,48 with a rate constant of 1.976 × 10–3 s–1. The turnover frequency (TOF) values, defined as
the number of moles of the product formed per unit time per mole of
the catalyst, of the materials studied are given in Table 2.

Apart from exhibiting a high TOF, the catalyst also
has the advantage
of recyclability. As the catalyst is weakly magnetic, it is easily
separated from the reaction mixture using a strong magnet, enabling
easy recycling (Figure 5). The catalytic activity of Co-doped MoS2 remains nearly
constant over a number of cycles (Figure 6f). The morphology and composition of the
catalyst remain almost the same after six cycles of catalysis. Earlier
attempts to make MoS2-based catalysts magnetic have been
through hybridization of MoS2 nanosheets with magnetic
nanoparticles such as Fe3O4.27 One of the shortcomings of such approaches is the increased
net weight of the catalyst because the magnetic component of the hybrid
does not provide sites for catalytic action. Here, the advantage is
that the dopant that improves the catalytic efficiency also makes
the catalyst magnetic.

Treating Co-doped MoS2 with
an acid leads to deintercalation
of interlayer NH3/NH4+ and removal
of about 30% of Co2+, which were either intercalated or
in the edge planes. Catalytic reduction of 4-NP using acid-leached
Co-doped MoS2 exhibits a slight decrease in catalytic activity
(Table 2). In contrast,
ammoniated 1T-MoS2 synthesized in the absence of a cobalt
source exhibits relatively very poor catalytic activity toward 4-NP
reduction (Table 2).
The comparison of the catalytic activities (Table 2) of the catalysts used in 4-NP reduction
suggests that incorporation of cobalt ions in the MoS2 lattice
is crucial to maximizing the efficiency of the catalyst.

Figure 6b,c traces
the reduction of nitroaniline and nitrobenzene, respectively, in the
presence of as-prepared Co-doped MoS2. The results show
that the catalyst is universally effective in the reduction of nitro
groups in different substrates and in at least two polar solvents.
In fact, the catalyst is most efficient in the reduction of nitrobenzene,
a reaction that is of importance in the removal of toxic nitrobenzene
from effluents. In all of the cases, reduction of nitroarene does
not occur in the absence of the catalyst.

In comparison to what
has so far been reported in the literature
(Table 3), the enhanced
TOF and recyclability make Co-doped MoS2 a superior catalyst.
The TOF of Co-doped MoS2 is 1 order greater than that of
the best MoS2-based catalyst and ∼20% higher than
the best value reported so far.

In Co-doped MoS2, Co2+ takes residence at
the coordinatively unsaturated sulfur vacancies on the basal plane
and edge sites.10,58 This leads to a conversion of
a fraction of Mo4+ to Mo3+, thus stabilizing
the 1T polytype.15 Doped Co2+ distorts the close-packed sulfur layer of MoS2 and induces
lattice strain.59,60 These sites would lower the reaction
free energy.28 Nitroarenes are adsorbed
at the strained active sites of the MoS2 surface.59−61 At these sites, the electron transfer to the substrate is facilitated
by Co2+/Co3+ redox couple. The electrons generated
by the hydrolysis of NaBH4 are transferred to the Co2+-accommodated basal and edge sites of 1T MoS2 and
are promoted into the MoS2 conduction band.59 The Co-substituted sites not only instigate
faster electron transfer for nitroarene reduction through reversible
reduction–oxidation reactions but also serve as an electron
reserve and aid in the retention of the 1T phase with enhanced electrical
conductivity.

The role of Co in improving the catalytic efficiency
is very clear
from the fact that the control MoS2, which has intercalated
NH3/NH4+ and hence has similar access
to surface as that of Co-doped MoS2, shows poor activity
(TOF is 1 order lower). As Co-doped MoS2 is largely few-layer
thick, the lattice expansion by intercalated species may not be very
important and this is borne out from the almost similar activity of
the acid-treated sample, which does not have intercalated species.
This observation may be important when these catalysts are used in
the hydrogen evolution reaction, the reaction medium of which is usually
fairly acidic. To further ascertain the role of Co sites in catalysis,
the catalytic activity of Co-doped MoS2 with varying cobalt
contents was studied. The increase in TOF of 4-nitrophenol reduction
with an increase in Co doping (Table 2) further confirms the importance of Co sites in the
catalyst.

3 Conclusions
Magnetic, 1T Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets with the cobalt
ion-activated defective basal planes and S-edges are synthesized in
a single-step hydrothermal reaction. Readily dispersible in polar
solvents like water or methanol, Co-doped MoS2 nanosheets
exhibit exceptional catalytic activity toward reduction of nitroarenes
at ambient temperature. In addition to exhibiting a high turnover
frequency, the catalyst can be magnetically separated from the reaction
mixture, thus enabling recyclability simple and efficient. The superior
catalytic activity of the Co-doped MoS2 layers may be due
to a combination of (a) stabilization of the metallic 1T phase and
(b) better electron capture from the hydride and electron supply to
the nitroarene substrates through reversible redox reactions at the
Co sites.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation
of Co-Doped MoS2 Nanosheets
Cobalt acetate (0.214
g) was dissolved in 45 mL of water. Ammonium
tetrathiomolybdate (0.442 g) was added to the pink Co2+ solution, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Hydrazine hydrate
(5 mL) was added to the solution, and stirring was continued for another
15 min. The black-brown solution was transferred to a teflon-lined
autoclave and sealed in a stainless steel canister. The autoclave
was heated in a hot-air oven at 180 °C for 24 h and cooled to
room temperature under ambient conditions. The pH of the supernatant
at the end of the reaction was ∼12. The black precipitate was
washed with distilled water till the pH of the washings is ∼7,
followed by washing with acetone. The product was dried in air at
ambient temperature. The preparation was repeated using 0.107 and
0.054 g of cobalt acetate to vary the cobalt content in the product.

4.2 Acid Leaching of Co-Doped MoS2 Nanosheets
To extract the intercalated and free cobalt species, 100 mg of
Co-doped MoS2 was stirred in 5 mL of 1 N HCl for 24 h.
The supernatant was collected. The process was repeated thrice. The
cobalt content in the supernatant was estimated. The black solid was
washed with water followed by acetone and dried in air at ambient
temperature.

4.3 Preparation of MoS2 Nanosheets
As a control experiment, the synthesis
was repeated in the absence
of cobalt acetate, which results in ammoniated MoS2 nanosheets.

4.4 Reduction of Nitroarenes Using Co-Doped MoS2 Nanosheets as a Catalyst
4.4.1 Reduction
of 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP)
The catalyst (10 mg) was dispersed
in 100 mL of water by stirring
for 1 h. 4-NP (512 mg, 37 mM) was dissolved in 100 mL of the catalytic
dispersion. An excess of NaBH4 (1.51 g, 400 mM) was added
with constant stirring [4-NP:NaBH4 molar ratio was 1:12].
The progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance
of 4-NP at 400 nm.

4.4.2 Reduction of 4-nitroaniline
(4-NA)
The catalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of water
by stirring
for 1 h. 4-NA (192 mg, 14 mM) was dissolved in 100 mL of the catalytic
dispersion. An excess of NaBH4 (1.51 g, 400 mM) was added
with constant stirring [4-NA/NaBH4 molar ratio was 1:28].
The progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance
of 4-NA at 380 nm.

4.4.3 Reduction of Nitrobenzene
(NB)
The catalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of methanol
by stirring
for 1 h. Nitrobenzene (0.52 mL, 50 mM) was dissolved in the dispersion.
An excess of NaBH4 (1.51 g, 400 mM) was added with constant
stirring [NB/NaBH4 molar ratio was 1:8]. The progress of
the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance of nitrobenzene
at 259 nm.

In all of the cases, an excess amount of NaBH4 was used to ensure that its concentration could be considered
constant throughout the reaction and the molar ratio in each case
was optimized at the lowest NaBH4 concentration that results
in the shortest reaction time.

For comparison, the nitroarene
reduction reactions were carried
out (a) in the absence of the catalyst, (b) using control ammoniated
MoS2 nanosheets as a catalyst, and (c) acid-treated Co-MoS2 nanosheets.

4.5 Characterization
All of the samples
were analyzed by recording powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
using a PANalytical X’pert pro diffractometer (Cu Kα
radiation, secondary graphite monochromator, scanning rate of 1°
2θ/min). The amount of Co2+ was estimated by a Varian
AA240 atomic absorption spectrometer using a Co hallow cathode lamp
in an air–acetylene flame at a wavelength of 324.4 nm. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with
Kratos axis Ultra DLD. All spectra were calibrated to the binding
energy of the C 1s peak at 284.51 eV. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis was carried out using a Zeiss, Ultra 55 field emission
scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
were acquired with Tecnai T20 operated at 200 kV. UV–visible
spectra of the reaction mixtures were recorded on a PerkinElmer (LS
35) UV–visible spectrometer. The Raman spectra of the samples
were recorded on HORIBA Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 at 532 nm excitation
wavelength. Isothermal magnetization [M vs H] was measured using a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) magnetometer.
