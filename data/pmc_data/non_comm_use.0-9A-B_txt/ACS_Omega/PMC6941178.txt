The biorefining of agricultural waste into green chemicals
has
clear potential for improving global environmental sustainability.
In this study, we evaluated the potential of acetic acid production
from carbohydrate feedstock (onion waste, OW) as a more environmentally
friendly source than feedstock produced from natural gas. In particular,
OW is an ideal feedstock for the biorefining process as it contains
a sufficient amount of carbohydrates (69.7%). Five days of the simultaneous
saccharification and two-step fermentation (SSTF) process produced
acetic acid from OW more efficiently than the simultaneous saccharification
and cofermentation (SSCF) process. SSTF produced 19.3 g/L acetic acid
and recorded the highest conversion yield (90.5%) from OW (6% substrate
loading, w/v). These results suggested that acetic acid can be efficiently
and sustainably produced from OW by the SSTF process.

1 Introduction
Ongoing development and
global population growth result in ever-increasing
amounts of waste production.1 Meanwhile,
the biorefining of waste materials to produce green chemicals has
become increasingly important worldwide; this can form the foundation
of a future economy based on biological chemicals and bioactive compounds.
Agricultural waste, which accounts for over 30% of worldwide agricultural
productivity, is an ideal resource for producing fermentable sugar
such as glucose, fructose, and galactose.1,2 For
example, onions are a major agricultural product whose global production
increased to 97.8 million tons in 2017 owing to their beneficial medicinal
and nutritional effects (FAO). Although onions and their by-products
are rich in fiber and bioactive compounds with high nutritional value,
500 000 tons of onion waste (OW) are discarded annually in
Europe; this is becoming an environmental issue in Spain, the Netherlands,
and the United Kingdom.3−5 Therefore, researching upcycling processes for converting
onion waste into green chemicals has become increasingly important,
especially in Asia, which accounts for ∼63.7% of global onion
production.

Acetic acid is generally used as a food preservative
or for the
production of commercial chemicals,6 especially
vinyl acetate monomer, which polymerizes as a poly(vinyl acetate)
for a variety of commercial uses.7 The
global market for acetic acid is expected to increase at a compound
annual growth rate of more than 4.30% from 2019 to 2024.8 The Asia-Pacific region is estimated to lead
the market with ∼34% of total global demand because of rapid
growth in the global textile market. However, as acetic acid production
is primarily based on natural gas, the ongoing depletion of global
fossil fuel resources makes the diversification of production processes
urgent. Diverting this toward agricultural wastes will have a significant
positive environmental impact. While the introduction of oxygen into
petroleum-based chemicals is chemically difficult, bio-based chemicals
naturally contain oxygen.9

In this
study, we investigated one approach to utilizing OW for
acetic acid production using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Acetobacter aceti and compared
the simultaneous saccharification and two-step fermentation (SSTF)
and simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) methods.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Composition of OW
The efficient
and sufficient use of agricultural feedstock can be improved by the
sustainable use of biorefinery processes.10,11 Sufficient carbohydrate content and production yield are necessary
to produce acetic acid from agricultural waste. OW can be used for
the production of biochemical or bioactive compounds such as bioethanol,
rare sugar, and quercetin because it has a sufficient carbohydrate
content and efficient bioactive compound.1,5 The
chemical composition of OW (Table 1) is affected by agronomic methods, harvest time, cultivar,
maturity stages, storage time, and environmental conditions.12 The OW dry matter tested in this study had 69.7%
carbohydrate content composed mainly of glucose (35.1%), fructose
(21.5%), sucrose (7.6%), galactose (4.0%), mannose (0.6%), xylose
(0.5%), and arabinose (0.4%) (Table 1). Carbohydrate content varies among different biomass
types, including wheat straw (57.7%), rice straw (57.3%), rapeseed
(68.6%), corn stover (67.7%), cornstalk (62.0%), banana waste (28.0%),
and sugarcane bagasse (67.0%).13,14 OW clearly has a suitable
carbohydrate content for acetic acid production using the fermentation
process of S. cerevisiae and A. aceti.

2.2 Immunogold Labeling Assay of Pectin in Onion
Figure 1 shows examples
of overall pectin distribution in our onion samples. The monoclonal
antibody LM20, which can recognize the homogalacturonan domain of
pectin polysaccharides including the methylester groups, was selected
to analyze the distribution of pectin within the onion’s structure.15 Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide mainly present
in the primary cell wall and middle lamella of terrestrial plants;16 in onion, this mainly exists in the parenchyma
cell walls.1

ML: middle lamella, P: parenchyma, PCW: primary cell wall, VP: vascular
parenchyma, SCW: secondary cell wall, and V: vessel. Pectin content
in different areas is given below the imagery.

We assessed the selectivity of pectin in onion
because the structure
of the primary cell walls plays a crucial role in their mechanical
properties.17 Pectin affects the mechanical
behavior of the multicellular epidermal surface.18 Our transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed
the following distribution of gold particles: parenchyma cell (29.8
particles/μm2), outer layer (13.9 particles/μm2), abaxial epidermis (9.3 particles/μm2),
and vessel (3.0 particles/μm2) (Figure 1), suggesting that pectin is
a major component of OW, allowing the efficient hydrolyzation of monosaccharides
by pectinase treatment.

2.3 Optimization of Enzyme Loading Content
Enzymatic saccharification was conducted on 1% substrate (OW, w/v)
with a variable loading of pectinase (0.0–19.2 mg/g OW) and
cellulase (0.0–18.4 mg/g OW) at 45 °C. The production
of fermentable sugar can be increased by increasing the enzyme loading
contents. After a 24 h reaction, the fermentable sugar content was
calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis;
the enzyme loading results were used to determine that the optimal
loading with respect to economic feasibility was 4.8 mg/g OW of pectinase
and 4.6 mg/g OW of cellulase (Table 2).

The enzyme demand for the production of fermentable
sugar from
lignocellulosic biomass is a major factor affecting production cost.
Newman et al. (2013) reported that enzyme cost for the production
of lignocellulosic sugar accounted for 54 and 25–38% of the
total cost for steam-exploded pine wood and corn stover, respectively.19 To decrease the enzyme loading content, various
pretreatments for lignocellulosic biomass have been used to improve
the enzyme accessibility for cellulose and hemicellulose fiber. However,
these processes increase the production cost of fermentable sugar.
Unlike lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural waste (such as kimchi
cabbage waste) can easily produce fermentable sugar using pectinase
treatment without a pretreatment.20 Similarly,
onion juicing residue (4.2%), onion peel (4.2%), and brown skin (1.5%)
are structurally soft with very low lignin content.1,21,22 Therefore, fermentable sugar from OW can
be efficiently produced by enzymatic hydrolysis without pretreatment.

2.4 Fermentable Sugar Production by OW Concentration
After enzymatic hydrolysis, the OW samples recorded fermentable
sugar contents of 20.1, 38.7, 56.1, 72.3, and 86.3 g/L and conversion
yields of 98.2, 94.5, 91.3, 88.3, and 84.4% for the 3, 6, 9, 12, and
15% substrates, respectively (Figure 2). As the substrate concentration increased, the sugar
conversion yield decreased and the sugar production content increased.
Previous studies documented conversion yields for coffee waste and
jack beans of 71.9 and 87.8% for substrate concentrations of 10 and
8%, respectively.23,24 These results suggested that
OW can be used as a major feedstock for biorefining.

and enzymatic conversion yields (stars)
for OW at 3–15% substrate concentrations.

2.5 Acetic Acid Production
Hydrothermal
reaction and bioconversion processes have been widely used for the
production of acetic acid from biomass.25,26 In the former,
lactic acid is produced from biomass and then converted to acetic
acid via an oxidant, obtaining acetic acid yields of 26, 22, and 23%
from glucose, cellulose, and starch, respectively.27 In the latter, two-step fermentation efficiently produces
acetic acid by first producing ethanol by yeast such as S. cerevisiae, Pichia stipites, and Zymonas mobilis through the
fermentation of sugar, then producing acetic acid from ethanol by
acetic acid bacteria such as Acetobacter spp. and Gluconacetobacter spp. For example, Wang et al. (2013) reported
the production of acetic acid from glucose using a mixed fermentation
of S. cerevisiae and A. pasteurianus in a batch and fed-batch culture
process.28 In this study, we used the SSTF
and SSCT processes to determine the best approach for the production
of acetic acid from OW. There was a significant difference in acetic
acid production between fermentation methods (F =
918.1, df = 1,120, P < 0.001)
(Table 3). Acetic acid
concentration increased with the increase of the OW concentration
from 2 to 10% (F = 388.1, df = 4,120, P < 0.001) and with the increase of the fermentation
period from 1 to 5 days, except at the two least concentrations (2–4%)
of OW (F = 721.0, df = 5,120, P < 0.001) (Figures 4 and 5). At 6–10% OW
concentrations, with both fermentation methods, the greatest acetic
acid concentration was already achieved after 4 days of fermentation.
No further increase occurred thereafter.

2.5.1 SSTF
After initial simultaneous
saccharification and fermentation (SSF), a significant difference
in ethanol production was observed with OW concentrations (F = 676.8, df = 4,10, P < 0.001). The OW samples recorded ethanol concentrations of 6.8
g/L with 2% OW and 31.2 g/L with 10% OW and conversion yields of 95.7
and 87.9%, respectively. Ethanol production increased and ethanol
conversion yield decreased slightly when OW concentration increased
from 2 to 10% (Figure 3). Subsequently, acetic acid production increased with the increase
of OW concentration (F = 518.9, df = 4,60, P < 0.001) and the fermentation period
from 0 to 5 days (F = 468.5, df =
5,60, P < 0.001) (Figure 4). In a similar study,
the cofermentation of yeast and acetic acid bacteria strains for 9
days resulted in efficient acetic acid production of 25.88 g/L from
food waste.29 In particular, the conversion
yield of acetic acid was 73.7% after 5 days, despite the high production
of acetic acid (23.0 g/L) from ethanol (31.2 g/L) achieved at 10%
(w/v) onion substrate (Figure 3). It is thought that A. aceti can tolerate acetic acid concentrations of up to 2.3%. These results
indicated that OW with a 6% (w/v) substrate concentration was suitable
for acetic acid production due to its high conversion yield (90.5%).
At lower ethanol concentrations, the acetic acid production tended
to decrease over time as it oxidized to CO2 and H2O.30 Thus, we achieved good acetic acid
productivity using the rapid processing method.

0.05.

and fermentation time using the SSTF method. At each fermentation
time, curves sharing a common letter do not differ significantly at P < 0.05.

2.5.2 SSCF
SSCF has been widely used
for the production of bioethanol from xylose-rich lignocellulosic
biomass.31 In this study, sugar and ethanol
were co-fermented at 32 °C using SSCF for the efficient production
of ethanol because the optimum temperature for S. cerevisiae is 32 °C ± 2, while that for acetic acid bacteria is 30
°C.32,33

After a 5 day processing, acetic acid
yields of 1.0–14.9 g/L were obtained from OW substrate concentrations
(v/w) of 2–10% (F = 39.5, df = 4,60, P < 0.001) (Figure 5). Acetic acid concentration increased with the fermentation
period (F = 289.2, df = 4,60, P < 0.001). The initial acetic acid productivity was
higher with a lower substrate concentration, but the highest acetic
acid output was recorded at 4–10% (w/v) OW substrate concentration.
Overall, SSTF was more efficient than SSCF for acetic acid production
because it optimized ethanol production (F = 918.1, df = 1,120, P < 0.001) (Table 3). Also, acetic acid strongly
inhibits the SSF process for enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation.34 These results suggest that considering economic
feasibility and productivity, SSTF is more suitable than SSCF for
the production of acetic acid from OW. However, SSCF offers several
advantages despite its lower productivity, including reduced capital
cost and continuous removal of end-production inhibition on enzymatic
hydrolysis.35 Some studies have reported
that SSF is more productive than separate hydrolysis and fermentation
(SHF) in ethanol production.36,37 For example, ethanol
production by SSF from corn stover recorded a 13% higher ethanol conversion
yield than SHF.37

and fermentation time using the SSCF method. At each fermentation
time, curves sharing a common letter do not differ significantly at P < 0.05.

2.6 Overall Mass Balance for the Production of
Acetic Acid
After the comparison of the SSTF and SSCF processes,
we designed an overall mass balance for the ideal production of acetic
acid from OW, in which 100 kg of OW contained 7.6 kg sucrose, 35.1
kg glucose, and 21.5 kg fructose (Figure 6). For SSTF, ethanol production (6% substrate
loading, v/w) was conducted with cellulase, pectinase, and S. cerevisiae at 32 °C for 48 h; then, acetic
acid production was conducted with A. aceti at 30 °C for 72 h, resulting in acetic acid production of 32.2
kg. For SSCF, acetic acid production (6% substrate loading, v/w) was
conducted with cellulase, pectinase, S. cerevisiae, and A. aceti at 32 °C for 120
h, resulting in an acetic acid production of 24.9 kg.

for acetic acid production from onion waste
based on the SSTF and SSCF methods.

3 Conclusions
This study evaluated the
possibility of producing acetic acid from
OW. OW contains a sufficient amount of monosaccharides (69.7%). The
SSTF and SSCF processes for 60 g of OW (6% substrate loading, w/v)
can produce 19.3 and 14.9 g of acetic acid, respectively. Thus, we
conclude that OW can be a major natural feedstock, and SSTF is an
ideal process for the production of acetic acid.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Raw Materials and Chemical Composition Analysis
We obtained OW from an onion field in Muan, South Korea. The OW
was dried by a lyophilizer at −80 °C for 7 days, ground
to particles using an electric grinder, and stored at −20 °C
until further use. The soluble sugar content (sucrose, glucose, and
fructose) of the OW was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with a refractive index detector (2414; Waters, Milford, MA);
a REZEX RPM (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) column (300 × 7.8 mm)
was used at 85 °C by adding deionized water at a flow rate of
0.6 mL/min. The insoluble sugar content (arabinose, xylose, mannose,
galactose, and glucose) of the OW was analyzed by gas chromatography
(GC). The sample pretreatment and GC analysis method followed that
given by Choi et al.5

4.2 Immunogold Labeling Assay of Pectin in Onion
Onion pieces were fixed at 4 °C for 6 h using 0.1% glutaraldehyde
(v/v) and 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) in a 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.2). After washing with a sodium cacodylate buffer, the samples
were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in LR white
resin (London Resin Co., London, U.K.). Ultrathin sections (80 nm)
were mounted on nickel grids of 300 mesh. After washing, the grids
were treated with LM20 primary antibodies (PlantProbes, Leeds, U.K.)15 at 4 °C for 2 days, then labeled with an
anti-Rat lgG antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) conjugated to 10 nm gold
particles at 25 °C for 3 h. After staining with 4% uranyl acetate,
the sections of pectin distribution were studied using a transmission
electron microscope (TEM, JEM-1400; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).

4.3 Optimization of Enzyme Loading Content
We purchased cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L) and pectinase (Pectinex
SP-L) from Novozyme A/S (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) for enzymatic saccharification
of OW. The cellulase and pectinase activities were 0.356 filter paper
unit/mg protein and 240 international unit (IU)/mg protein, respectively.
To optimize the enzyme loading content, enzymatic saccharification
was performed on 1% substrate (OW, w/v) with variable loading of pectinase
(0.0–19.2 mg/g of OW) and cellulase (0.0–18.4 mg/g of
OW) for 24 h at 45 °C. After the enzymatic hydrolysis, the soluble
sugar contents were calculated by HPLC with a glucose and fructose
standard curve.

4.4 Enzymatic Saccharification According to OW
Concentration
The enzymatic saccharification of OW was conducted
in 100 mL of citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.8) containing 3–15%
(w/v) dry matter, pectinase (4.8 mg/g OW), and cellulase (4.6 mg/g
OW) at 45 °C in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. After 48 h incubation,
soluble sugar content and sugar conversion yield were calculated using
the standard curve and initial sugar content (69.7%) of the OW, respectively.

4.5 Acetic Acid Production
We tested
both the SSTF and SSCF processes to determine the best method for
acetic acid production from OW.

4.5.1 SSTF
We first produced ethanol
from 100 mL of OW containing 2.0–10.0% (w/v) dry matter, pectinase
(4.8 mg/g OW), and cellulase (4.6 mg/g OW), 1 mL of S. cerevisiae (KCCM 11293), 0.3% yeast extract, 0.3%
malt extract, and 0.5% peptone at 32 °C for 48 h. After the reaction,
acetic acid fermentation for 100 mL hydrolysates (2.0–10.0%)
with 1 mL of A. aceti (KCCM 40229)
was conducted at 30 °C for 5 days. The ethanol and acetic acid
content were analyzed by HPLC using a refractive index detector (2414;
Waters, Milford, MA) and REZEX RPM (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) column
(300 × 7.8 mm) and with a UV–vis detector (2489; Waters)
at 210 nm and Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) column (300 ×
7.8 mm), respectively.

4.5.2 SSCF
We produced acetic acid using
100 mL of OW containing 2.0–10.0% (w/v) dry matter, pectinase
(4.8 mg/g OW), and cellulase (4.6 mg/g OW), 1 mL of S. cerevisiae, 1 mL of A. aceti, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, and 0.5% peptone at 32 °C
for 5 days. After the reaction, the acetic acid content was analyzed
by HPLC.

4.5.3 Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were triplicated in a completely randomized block design. Data were
analyzed using PASW software (Version 17, SPSS Inc., CA). Analysis
of variance tests was used to determine the significant differences
between treatments at P < 0.05 using Tukey’s
honestly significant difference test. Data are expressed as means
with standard deviations.
