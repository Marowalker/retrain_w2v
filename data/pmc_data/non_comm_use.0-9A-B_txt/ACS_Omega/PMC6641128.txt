In
this article, tannic acid (TA), as an earth-abundant natural
polymer, has been creatively proposed as a desirable organic anode
material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Most importantly, it has
been observed that the substitution of different concentrations of
lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) for lithium hexafluorophosphate
(LiPF6) can significantly restrain the dissolution of TA.
This fact implies that LiTFSI, especially at high concentrations,
is beneficial to accelerate electrochemical kinetics, enlarge the
specific capacity, improve the rate performance, and prolong the cycling
life for organic LIBs.

1 Introduction
Rechargeable
lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been recently found
to be one of the promising renewable energy storage devices. They
have been widely used in various fields such as portable electronic
devices, state grid, and energy storage devices for electric or hybrid
electric vehicles because of their high energy density and long cycling
life. To pursue higher energy density, larger power density, and safeness
to meet the high power demand for an electric vehicle, it is extremely
essential to explore secure battery materials with a desirable capacity
and rate performance.1−5 However, most of the electrode materials especially for anodes in
LIBs are predominately occupied by inorganic compounds with limited
theoretical specific capacities and restricted structural variability.6−8 In addition, such wanton depletion of inorganic elements would also
inevitably bring about resource scarcity and environmental concern.
Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop organic materials for
energy storages with enhanced performances in a cheap, sustainable,
and environment-friendly manner.

Until now, organic materials
(polymers or small molecules), including
organosulfur compounds,9 free radical compounds,10,11 carbonyl compounds,12−14 nonconjugated redox polymers, and so forth,15,16 have been attempted for LIBs because of their structural diversity,
chemical and physical stability, and mechanical softness. On the basis
of the redox reaction mechanism, these organics exhibited high specific
capacities with speedy kinetic characteristics. However, most of them
were derived from chemical feed stocks with high cost issues and terrible
environmental concerns. Even though several natural materials have
been presented for LIBs by our group and our counterparts,17,18 it is still a challenge to further enrich the abundance of natural
organics for their substantial applications in LIBs.

To push
organic electrode materials into practical applications
in LIBs, besides an emphasis on specific capacity (SC), research to
improve the rate capability and cycling stability is also a significant
concern. Because of their nonpolar nature, these organics would inevitably
dissolve into the nonaqueous electrolyte, which results in loss of
capacity, poor rate capability, and short cycling life.19−21 To suppress the dissolution phenomenon, several strategies such
as the fabrication of quasisolid state cells with polymer electrolyte,22 the application of porous substrates to load
or anchor active materials,23 and the transformation
or solidification of organics into polymers24 have been proposed. However, most of the above-mentioned procedures
involved in these strategies are always complex, time-consuming, and
still fail to meet the practical demands. Meanwhile, it cannot be
neglected that the components of an electrolyte (salts, solvents,
and additives) also play vital roles in controlling the transfer dynamics
of charged species and the correlated accumulation performance. For
instance, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) has superior
advantages in terms of safety, ionic conductivity, and thermal stability
over those of commonly used lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6);25 LiTFSI forms a better and
stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer as well.26,27 More recently, it has been demonstrated that LiTFSI can efficiently
inhibit the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfide species for lithium–sulfur
batteries.28−30 Inspired by this success, we tried to explore the
possibility of using LiTFSI to effectively restrain the dissolution
of organic materials in LIBs. Most importantly, the effect of the
concentration of LiTFSI on the Li-ion storage behavior for tannic
acid (TA) was investigated in detail.

Hence, this article provides
evidence for the use of TA extracted
from woods for various applications including food, mordant, medication,
and so forth31,32 as a promising anode material
for LIBs by virtue of the abundance of oxygen-containing functionalities.
Furthermore, it was proved that the salt alteration from LiPF6 to LiTFSI could efficiently suppress the dissolution of TA,
accelerate the electrochemical kinetic for charge accumulation, and
eventually lead to a prominent enhancement in storage performance
(storage capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability).

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the molecular structure of TA. It is found that TA contains a large
variety of oxygen-containing functionalities including polyphenol,
quinone, and ketone groups, which can be confirmed from the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, as shown in Figure 1b. In detail, the strong peak at 3393 cm–1 can be attributed to the existence of a polyphenolic
hydroxyl moiety (Ph–OH). The weak shoulder at 2741.1 cm–1 is ascribed to the stretching of a C–H group.
The peaks near the 1700 cm–1 region might have originated
from carbonyl stretching (C=O). The peaks at 1700–1400
cm–1 can be assigned to the vibrations of the benzene
ring. The peaks at 1400–1200 cm–1 can be
indexed to the O–H deformation of the carboxyl group (O=C–O–H).
The peaks ranging from 1300 to 1000 cm–1 are due
to the stretching of carbohydrate or alcoholic bonds (C–O–C
or C–O). The wavenumbers from 900 to 860 cm–1 might have resulted from the plane vibrations of aromatic C–H,
benzene, and alkyl benzene bonds. This structural information implies
the existence of redox functionalities and the resulting potential
for ion accumulation.

TA.

To probe the dissolution behavior
of TA in various electrolytes,
photographic observations were conducted (shown in the Experimental Section). As shown in Figure 2a, TA can be easily dissolved into the mixture
solvent (ethylene carbonate/diethylcarbonate [EC/DEC]) to form a clear
solution (bottle i). If the same amount of TA is added to 1 M LiPF6, most of the TA gets dissolved, forming a turbid solution
(bottle ii). Most interestingly, a large amount of TA is precipitated
at the bottom of the vessel because of the addition of LiTFSI (bottle
iii). This discrepancy in the dissolving capacity suggests that the
addition of LiTFSI can effectively suppress the dissolution of TA
into nonpolar electrolytes (EC/DEC).

Figure 2 (a) Photograph of dissolution of TA in
(i) ethylene carbonate/diethylcarbonate
(EC/DEC) solvent, (ii) 1 M LiPF6, and (iii) 1 M LiTFSI;
(b) cyclic voltammograms of TA in 1 M LiPF6 and 3 M LiTFSI
in the potential range from 0 to 3.5 V (vs Li+/Li) at a
scan rate of 1 mV s–1; (c) charge–discharge
profiles of TA in 3 M LiTFSI at a current density of 10 mA g–1; and (d) second charge–discharge profiles of TA in different
electrolytes at a current density of 10 mA g–1.

To evaluate the electrochemical
performance of TA in different
electrolytes, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were performed with a half
cell system, where TA was used as the active material and lithium
foil worked as both the reference electrode and the counter electrode,
respectively (Figures 2b and S2). As demonstrated in Figure 2b, reduction peaks
centered at 1.1 and 1.5 V are observed for TA in 1 M LiPF6 and 3 M LiTFSI, respectively, during the cathodic scan from 3.5
to 0 V. Similar reaction peaks are also observed in 1 M LiTFSI and
5 M LiTFSI. Accompanying by the inconspicuous oxidation peaks during
the anodic scans, the reduction peaks imply the potential application
of TA as the anode material for lithium ion accumulation.33 The current increase below 1 V was attributed
to the insertion/extraction of solvated lithium ions into/from the
electrode, accompanied by a sharp current increase. In addition, the
galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles were also examined
(Figures 2c,d and S3). As shown in Figure 2c, TA experiences a sharp voltage drop to
1.0 V and follows a gentle slope from 1.0 to 0.1 V with a specific
discharge capacity of 900 mA h g–1 in 3 M LiTFSI
during the first discharge. After the intercalation of lithium ions,
TA releases a capacity of 312 mA h g–1 with an initial
Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 34.6%. Such irreversible capacity loss
might be ascribed to electrolyte decomposition, the formation of SEI,
and partial dissolution of TA, which are common phenomena for LIB
anode materials at the first cycle.34 After
that, the lithium ion insertion and extraction processes become relatively
reversible, with a capacity of 306.83 mA h g–1 and
a CE of 93.4%. Similar tendencies are also found in other electrolytes
containing LiTFSI (Figure S3). On the contrary,
TA presents poorly discharged SCs of 376.67 and 164.16 mA h g–1 for the first and second cycles in 1 M LiPF6. Combined with the summarized charge–discharge behavior during
the second cycling test (Figure 2d), the discrepancies in lithium ion storage solidify
that LiTFSI works more efficiently to inhibit the dissolution of TA
than LiPF6 does. To further illuminate the differences
in morphology after lithiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
was performed (Figure S1). It can be clearly
seen that after lithiation the original granular TA particle with
a size of 300–600 nm accumulated and boundaries faded away
because of its dissolution and lithiation in electrolyte. After 30
cycles, a solid polymer film was formed.

To further understand
the lithium ion storage mechanism, FTIR spectra
of lithiated TA in different electrolytes were recorded. As elucidated
in Figure 3, after
the discharging process, the peaks located at 1700 and 1300 cm–1, assigned to C=O stretching and C–O–C
symmetric stretching in the pristine TA framework, disappeared, implying
the successful insertion of lithium ions. In addition, the intensity
of the in-plane bend of C–O–H of the hydroxyl group
at 1506 cm–1 strengthened, accompanied by the intercalation
of lithium ions. A band at 1341 cm–1 indexed to
the stretch of C–O was shown at lithiated TA in 1 M LiTFSI
and 5 M LiTFSI, but it strengthened at lithiated TA in 3 M LiTFSI,
implying a more complete reduction and the intercalation of more lithium
ions of TA in 3 M LiTFSI than in 1 M LiTFSI and 5 M LiTFSI. Furthermore,
ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were also recorded
and analyzed. As shown in Figure 4, some differences are observed in the collected C1s
and O1s spectra between the pristine and lithiated electrodes. The
peaks at 284.7 eV correspond to the catechol ring. The peak located
at 288.6 eV (C=O) in the pristine TA framework disappeared
after the intercalation of lithium ions, thus indicating the consumption
of carbonyl groups. The peak located at 286.5 eV assigned to C–O
increased in strength at the same time. The above analysis proved
that the transformation from ester carbonyl groups to C–O was
finished during the initial stage of the first lithiation process.
C–O in lithiated TA in 3 M LiTFSI is strengthened more than
that in 1 M LiPF6, accounting for the more complete reduction
and the intercalation of more lithium ions with TA in 3 M LiTFSI.
As for the O1s spectrum (Figure 4b), the peak corresponding to C=O centered at
533.9 eV also disappeared in the lithiated state, which was consistent
with the C1s spectra.

electrolytes

Figure 4 XPS spectra of (a) C1s and (b) O1s of pristine
TA electrodes and
lithiated TA electrodes recovered from the dismantled cells.

Furthermore, the rate capability
and the cycling stability of TA
in different electrolytes were also investigated (Figure 5a,b). Two important correlations
were observed: (1) LiTFSI has a positive effect on enhancing the capacity
and improving the cycling stability. In detail, the SCs of TA in other
electrolytes containing LiTFSI are always higher than that in LiPF6 at the same current density (Figure 5a). However, over 250 cycles, the retained
SC in LiTFSI systems (approximately 100 mA h g–1) is also higher than that in LiPF6 (26.5 mA h g–1) (Figure 5b). (2)
The optimization of the concentration of LiTFSI can affect the Li-ion
storage behavior of TA. For example, TA delivers much higher SCs and
rate capabilities in 3 M LiTFSI than in 1 M LiTFSI and 5 M LiTFSI
(Figure 5a). The SCs
in 3 M LiTFSI fluctuate with the variation in current density: 306.33
mA h g–1 (10 mA g–1), 245.17 mA
h g–1 (20 mA g–1), and 133.67
mA h g–1 (40 mA g–1). Furthermore,
a comparatively high capacity retention is also observed for TA in
3 M LiTFSI. Hence, it is deduced that the charge transfer behavior
of organic materials can be controlled by changing the counterions
or the concentration of salts in the electrolyte.

Figure 5 (a) Rate capabilities
of TA at current densities from 10 to 80
mA g–1 in different electrolytes and (b) cycling
performance of TA at a constant current of 40 mA g–1 in different electrolytes.

To further elucidate the electrochemical kinetics, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded. Figure 6a shows the Nyquist plots of TA in different
electrolytes. Besides the intercepts on the Z′
axis, which represent the internal resistance (Re, e.g., electrolyte resistance, contact resistances between
particles and/or between the electrode and the current collector),
two semicircles and an inclined line are found on the impedance curves.
According to the equivalent circuit model (Figure 6b), the semicircle at high frequencies can
be assigned to the resistance (Rs) and
constant phase element (CPE-1) of the SEI film. The semicircle at
medium frequencies can be ascribed to the charge transfer resistance
(Rct) and a nonideal constant phase element
(CPE-2) of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The inclined line
in the low-frequency region can be considered the Warburg impedance
(Zw) caused by the diffusion of Li ions
in the electrode materials.35,36 After fitting, the
obtained parameters are summarized in Table S1. It has been observed that electrolytes containing LiTFSI have faster
electrochemical kinetics than those containing LiPF6. Most
impressively, TA presents the smallest Rs and Rct values (1.507 × 103 and 82.47 Ω) in 3 M LiTFSI compared to those in the
other electrolytes, implying an excellent electrochemical performance
of TA in 3 M LiTFSI solution.

3 Conclusions
Through
the integration of chemical analyses with electrochemical
characterizations, TA has been validated as a promising anode material
for LIBs, benefiting from the abundant existence of oxygen-containing
functionalities and the correlated redox reactions. Most impressively,
using LiTFSI instead of LiPF6 can both improve the electrochemical
kinetics of TA and inhibit the dissolution of TA in organic media,
resulting in a significant enhancement in energy storage (high specific
capacity, excellent rate capability, and a stable long cycling life).
It is envisioned that this work will not only push forward the exploration
of organic electrode materials from natural resources but also pioneer
research on electrolytes to solve the dissolution issues in organic
energy storage devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparations of Electrolytes
EC and
DEC with a volume ratio of 4:6 were mixed together to form the solvent.
Then, different amounts of salt [lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiN(SO2CF3)2, LiTFSI) or lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)] were dissolved in the mixture
to form electrolytes with different concentrations (1 M LiTFSI, 3
M LiTFSI, 5 M LiTFSI, and 1 M LiPF6).

4.2 Assembly of Batteries
For the preparation
of working electrodes, a certain amount of TA (Sigma-Aldrich), conducting
carbon (Super P carbon black from Alfa Aesar), and binder (polytetrafluoroethylene,
PTFE) were mixed with a mass ratio of 6.5:3:0.5 using a pestle and
mortar followed by pressing on a current collector (copper foil).
After drying in vacuum, the as-prepared working electrodes, pure Li
metal, and Celgard membrane (3501) were used as the cathode, anode,
and separator, respectively, to fabricate coin-type (2032) batteries
with different electrolytes (1 M LiTFSI, 3 M LiTFSI, 5 M LiTFSI, and
1 M LiPF6).

4.3 Characterization and Electrochemical
Tests
To illustrate the differences in dissolution, the same
amount of
TA (30 mg) was added to EC/DEC, 1 M LiPF6, and 1 M LiTFSI
in the same volume (3 mL), which were labeled as i, ii, and iii, respectively.
The FTIR spectrum was measured on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 FTIR spectrophotometer.
The CV curves were recorded using a CHI630D electrochemical analyzer.
The discharge and charge measurements were taken using a Neware battery
test system. The morphologies of the electrode before and after lithiation
were characterized using an environmental SEM (FEI, QuanTA-200F).
The elemental compositions of the products were characterized using
XPS (Thermo-VG; ESCALAB 250) with an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray
source. EIS measurements were taken using a Princeton PARSTAT 2273
electrochemical workstation over a frequency range of 100 mHz to 100
kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. For the calculation of all gravimetric
capacities/currents, only the mass of the active material was taken
into account. The gravimetric capacitance of a single electrode was
calculated according to the following equation  where Cg (mA h
g–1) is the gravimetric specific capacitance, I (mA) is the charge/discharge current, t (s) is the charge/discharge time, and Δm (mg)
is the mass loading of active materials.
