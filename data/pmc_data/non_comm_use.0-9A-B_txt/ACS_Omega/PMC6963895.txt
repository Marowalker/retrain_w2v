Noble metal (Pt, Ru, and Ir)-based electrocatalysts are
currently
considered the most active materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER). Although they have been associated with high cost, easy agglomeration,
and poor stability during the HER reaction, recent efforts to intentionally
tailor noble-metal-based catalysts have led to promising improvements,
with lower cost and superior activity, which are critical to achieving
large-scale production of pure hydrogen. In this mini-review, we focus
on the recent advances in noble-metal-based HER electrocatalysts.
In particular, the synthesis strategies to enhance cost-effectiveness
and the catalytic activity for HER are highlighted.

1 Introduction
The hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) from water electrolysis is
considered the most promising approach for acquiring clean and renewable
hydrogen energy.1,2 However, the HER’s large
overpotential and undesirable kinetics impede its practical application.
More efficient catalysts are needed to improve HER performance and
achieve higher efficiency.3−6 Despite that tremendous efforts are paid to find
more efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production, noble-metal-based
materials remain the most efficient HER catalysts.7 Platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and iridium (Ir) in particular
not only possess high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity but also
can be effectively combined with other materials for superior catalytic
performance.1,8 Hence, tailoring these noble-metal-based
catalysts is considered crucial to rapidly developing a hydrogen economy
in the near future.

Noble-metal-based catalysts have inherent
problems, mainly of limited
reserve and poor stability.2,3 Scientists have developed
several methods to address these issues, for example, by downsizing
the noble metals to single atoms anchored on a porous conductive carbon-based
matrix, by forming alloys or by hybridizing with other inexpensive
transition metals.7,9 In addition, interface engineering
strategies have also been employed to resolve their high price and
instability.11 These approaches may allow
reliable industrial-scale hydrogen production.

In this mini-review,
we discuss recent developments in noble metal
(Pt, Ru, and Ir)-based catalysts for electrochemical HER, with the
primary focus on synthesis strategies and performance-improving factors.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which are being used
as a powerful tool to reveal the HER mechanisms of catalysts, are
highlighted. Last, some of the remaining challenges and promising
research directions of these noble-metal-based materials are presented.

2 General Principle of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has aroused enormous research
interest among chemists and materials scientists because of its potential
role in efforts to address the coming energy crisis and critical environmental
issues. The HER produces molecular hydrogen from water via different
pathways under different pH conditions. In alkaline media, hydrogen
intermediates (Had) are initially formed by the discharge
of water in the Volmer step (H2O + e– + catalyst = catalyst–Had + OH–), followed by the Heyrovsky step (H2O + catalyst-Had + e– = catalyst + H2 + OH–) or the combined Tafel step (2catalyst-Had = catalyst + H2).5,12 The reaction pathway
is similar in acidic electrolytes, except for the formation of catalyst-Had, which involves the discharge of hydrogen ions (H+ + catalyst + e– = catalyst-Had).9 The HER basically occurs via a Volmer–Heyrowsky
pathway or the Volmer–Tafel route. Both reaction pathways involve
the adsorption of hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen intermediates (Had) on the surface of the catalyst. As originally reported
by Parsons, the adsorption of Had subsequently becomes
the rate-determining step (RDS) of the entire HER mechanism.13 However, too weak or too strong hydrogen bond
formation can result in a lower reaction rate, by, respectively, affecting
the initial hydrogen adsorption process or the ultimate molecular
hydrogen desorption from the catalyst surface.2,12 Accordingly,
an ideal HER catalyst should possess hydrogen adsorption energies
(ΔGH) approaching ΔGH = 0.8,14

This principle
has guided the development of HER catalysts. The
volcano plot shown in Figure 1 presents observations from experimental and theoretical calculation
studies and illustrates the HER exchange currents and the metal–hydrogen
bond strengths of various metals. The volcano plot predicts that the
Pt-group metals (Pt, Ru, and Ir) have appropriate surface properties
and will be the most promising HER catalysts.2,12,14

energy (ΔGH) of metal–hydrogen
bonds for various pure metals. The experimental “volcano plot”
indicates that Pt, with the most approachable zero hydrogen absorption
energy, has the highest HER catalytic activity. Reprinted from the

Recently, enormous progress has also been made
on non-noble-metal-based
electrocatalysts.3−5 However, noble-metal-based hybrids are thus far still
preferred because of their superior activity, and they can be practically
adopted to meet industrial hydrogen production demands.15 The main obstacle to the commercial application
of noble metal electrocatalysts is their high cost. Recently, cost
issues have been greatly alleviated by reducing mass loading or by
forming alloys with other inexpensive metals.16,17 Other measures, including downsizing the particle size and engineering
active crystalline facets at the interface to enhance utilization
efficiency, have also been explored.18,19 Both strategies
have demonstrated the unexpected effect of improving activity while
lowering the integrated cost of the noble metal electrocatalysts.
We will discuss these points in more detail in the following section.

3 Noble-Metal-Based HER Catalysts
3.1 Platinum (Pt)-Metal-Based Catalysts
Platinum (Pt) exhibits the highest HER activity and is widely preferred
as an active HER catalyst for H2 production.11,16 The main obstacle to its industrial application is its high cost
and poor stability in corrosive electrolytes. The most promising strategy
has therefore been to find ways to reduce the loading amount of Pt
while retaining its high efficiency.7,8 Recently, Pt
nanoparticles supported on carbon-based composites are developed as
a promising way to enhance their catalytic activity toward HER.15 The carbon materials can be precisely controlled
to obtain a desirable nanostructure with high specific surface area.
This serves as the ideal matrix to support the Pt nanoparticles (NPs),
providing abundant active sites.3,12,16 Moreover, when using Pt-supported carbon-based hybrids, the substrate’s
enhanced electrical conductivity allows fast electron transfer for
HER kinetics. Superior catalytic activity can be induced by the strong
interaction with, and synergistic effect of, the metallic species
and the carbon supports, which also effectively prevents agglomeration
and leaching of the Pt NPs during the electrochemical process.16

Citing the advantageous synergistic effects
of the carbon matrix, Sun et al.18 prepared
single Pt atoms and clusters on a nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet
(NGN) matrix (ALD Pt/NGN) as a HER catalyst, using the controllable
atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. A Pt precursor was initially
anchored on the NGN substrates, and then a Pt-containing monolayer
was formed under the oxidative environment (Figure 2a). After the continuous anchoring and oxidizing
processes, the size distribution of Pt catalysts can be precisely
controlled by the self-limiting surface reactions of the ALD. Figure 2b compares the HER
activity of NGN, commercial Pt/C, and ALDPt/NGN prepared under 50
and 100 ALD cycles. The ALD50Pt/NGN and ALD100Pt/NGN exhibited superior
HER activity over Pt/C, and a lower Tafel slope value of 29 mV dec–1 was achieved with the ALDPt/NGN catalysts. Mass activity
(MA) was normalized with Pt loading and confirmed the ALD50Pt/NGN
sample had the highest HER performance, considering an available 10.1
A mg–1 MA parameter with a Pt loading as low as
2.1 wt %. The MA value of ALD50Pt/NGN also outperformed ALD100Pt/NGN
(2.12A mg–1) and a Pt/C catalyst (0.27A mg–1).

the ALD cycle process. (b) HER catalytic activity evaluation for ALD

Such results suggest that the single Pt atom and
clusters can remarkably
enhance Pt utilization efficiency compared with other NPs and reduce
the integrated cost of HER catalysts.

Stability, which is one
of the crucial factors in catalyst evaluation,
was also probed. The ALD50Pt/NGN exhibited almost the same LSV curve
before and after 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) images of the ALDPt/NGN after accelerated
degradation tests indicated the Pt particle size had slightly increased,
but no aggregation was observed, further confirming the robust stability
of ALDPt/NGN for HER.

The metal alloying process has emerged
as another promising technique
for advancing Pt-based HER catalysts. A Pt-based bimetallic system
formed by decoration of other transition metal species on Pt-based
materials has also been reported.9 Bimetallic
alloy catalysts have been shown to acquire unprecedented electronic
and chemical properties, which are distinctively different from their
parent metals.20 Fundamental surface science
research conducted on bimetallic catalysts has proven that the modification
is crucial to the unexpected property, which originates from a change
in heteroatom bonds and the novel nanostructure within the bimetallic
system. These factors endow Pt-based metallic catalysts with excellent
activity.15,20

Duan et al.7 synthesized single-atom
nickel-modified Pt nanowires (SANi-PtNWs) by partially dealloying
PtNi alloy nanowires. The formed SANi-PtNWs had abundant activated
Pt sites adjacent to single-atom Ni and minimal blocked Pt sites on
the surface, which led to the highest mass activity (MA) (Figure 3a). The cyclic voltammetry
tests of SANi-PtNWs suggested the appearance of two new redox peaks
(Ni2+/Ni3+) at around 1.32 and 1.34 V, compared
with pure-PtNWs. This suggests the successful decoration of nickel
species on PtNWs (Figure 3b). A linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) evaluation conducted
in 1 M N2-saturated KOH electrolyte revealed that the SANi-PtNWs
possessed the highest specific activity (SA), MA, and the lowest Tafel
slope value (Figure 3c–f), of 10.72 ± 0.41 mA cm–2, 11.80
± 0.43 A mgPt–1, and 60.3 mV dec–1, respectively, over pure-PtNWs (6.11 ± 0.34
mA cm–2, 6.90 ± 0.36 A mgPt–1, 78.1 mV dec–1) and Pt/C (0.95
mA cm–2, 0.71 A mgPt–1, 133.4 mV dec–1) catalysts. This clearly demonstrates
the remarkably enhanced HER kinetics of the single-atom decorated
alloy.

Publishing Group.

With the highest ECSA and SA values, the SANi-PtNWs
achieved a
leap in MA value, of ∼3–10 times higher MA, surpassing
many superior HER catalysts (Figure 3g).

DFT calculations indicated that the single
nickel atoms electronically
modified the neighboring Pt atoms, lowering their metal–hydrogen
bonding energy barrier to the range of the best HER activity.

The engineering of active crystalline facets is another promising
technique being used to rationally design efficient Pt-based HER catalysts.
In an early report, Markovic et al.21 indicated
that Pt surfaces exhibited facet-oriented HER activity in alkaline
media. They suggested that this activity mainly resulted from the
structure-sensitive blockage of overpotential deposition on H (Hopd) and the adsorption of HO– (OHad) species on different Pt facets. The activity of the Pt facets followed
the order of Pt(110) > Pt(100) > Pt(111).8,21

However, constructing monocrystalline noble metals with a well-defined
surface structure is not always feasible, even with a commonly used
sacrificial templated method.15 In that
case, introducing other active species to tune the active Pt-rich
facets may result in superior activity. Huang et al.15 developed platinum–nickel/nickel sulfide heterostructures
(Pt3Ni2 NWs-S/C) with a composition-segregated
feature. The active Pt(111) facets were greatly promoted after incorporating
Ni, forming Pt3Ni(111) facets. Interfacial NiS species
can trigger positive synergistic effects on Pt3Ni with
various activity. DFT calculations suggest that the hydrogen binding
energy GH* of Pt3Ni(111) is
almost identical to the value for Pt(111). Once the Pt3Ni(111) combines with the NiS(100) crystalline facet, the water dissociation
step and Hads adsorption can be balanced, to achieve exceptional
HER activity in alkaline environments (Figure 4).

and NiS(100) facets. (b) Reaction free energy diagram of HER on Pt(111),

3.2 Ruthenium (Ru)-Metal-Based Catalysts
As an inexpensive and viable alternative to Pt, ruthenium (Ru) has
similar metal-hydrogen-bond strength (∼65 kcal mol–1),22 and this enables Ru to exhibit HER
activity that is comparable to or even superior to Pt. Rare studies
have reported a pH-universal application of Ru toward HER. Beak et
al.22 prepared Ru on a nitrogenated holey
two-dimensional C2N structure (Ru@C2N) catalyst.
The C2N framework serves as a versatile platform for the
adsorption, nucleation, and growth of Ru nanoparticles (NPs), and
it also provides abundant coordination sites for the distribution
of small size Ru NPs within the C2N layers (Figure 5a). The as-prepared Ru@C2N catalyst was first tested in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution to evaluate HER performance. The Ru@C2N required the low overpotential of 22 mV to deliver a current density
of 10 mA cm–2, which is close to that of Pt/C (16
mV) and superior to Co@C2N (290 mV), Ni@C2N
(410 mV), Pd@C2N (330 mV), and Pt@C2N (60 mV)
samples (Figure 5b,c).
The small Tafel slope value suggests that Ru@C2N follows
a Volmer–Tafel reaction mechanism.

Changing the tested solution from acid to alkaline,
the Ru@C2N exhibited even higher activity with an accessible
low overpotential
of 17 mV, to reach the benchmark 10 mA cm–2 and
small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec–1, compared with
Pt/C (20.7 mV, 43 mV dec–1) (Figure 5d,e).

DFT calculations provide more
information about the differences
in the activity of the Ru@C2N in different pH environments.
In an acid solution, the Ru@C2N possesses a hydrogen binding
energy (0.55 eV H–1) that is very similar to that
of the active Pt(111) surface, whose value is typically regarded as
the optimal binding energy to efficiently facilitate proton adsorption,
reduction, and gas desorption. On the other hand, in alkaline media,
the Ru@C2N reaction proceeds by a different mechanism.
The Ru@C2N surface has fast H2O adsorption ability
and cleaves the adsorbed H2O into H and OH and then rapidly
transports the proton required for the following reaction step. This
favorably compensates the loss in efficiency during the Volmer step
produced by the strong OH binding.

In their latest work, Huang
et al.23 incorporated Ru with a transition
metal copper (Cu) to form channel-rich
RuCu snowflake-like nanosheets (NSs) (Figure 6a). The accessible channels within the 2D
nanosheets (Figure 6b) contributed to its improved electrocatalytic performance, which
resulted from increased surface area, boosted mass, and electron transfer
ability.

& Sons, Inc.

DFT calculations confirmed the surface electronic
activation of
the channel-rich area, and the critical importance of the synergistic
effect was exerted by amorphous Cu on crystallized Ru species, which
were responsible for the superior catalytic activity. In the adjacent
channel area, short-range disorder lowers the intermediate energetic
cost produced by the bond dissociation of lattice relaxation.

The PDOS plot demonstrated that the coexistence of a broad range
of electron-rich features within the Ru 4d bands and the electron-rich
states of the Cu 3d bands in RuCu NSs was beneficial to the rapid
electron transfer between the Ru and adsorbates.

To optimize
HER performance, the RuCu NSs were loaded on carbon
black and annealed at different temperatures. The as-synthesized RuCu
NSs/C-250 °C exhibited the best HER activity in both acid and
alkaline electrolytes. The RuCu NSs/C-250 °C required low overpotentials
of 20, 40, 19, and 27 mV to reach 10 mA cm–2 in
1.0 M KOH, 0.1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 0.05
M H2SO4 test solutions.

Other samples
including RuCu NPs/C-250 °C, Ir/C, and Pt/C
were inferior to the RuCu NSs/C-250 °C. Specifically, RuCu NSs/C-250
°C possessed small Tafel slopes of 15.3 and 22.3 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH solutions, much lower than Pt/C (39.8 and
42.0 mV dec–1), proving the dominant HER kinetics
of RuCu NSs/C-250 °C in the alkaline pathway.

In addition
to directly participating in the HER reaction, Ru has
also been proposed in efforts to produce beneficial modulation effects
to enhance HER activity. Dai and co-workers11 developed pod-like Ni@Ni2P–Ru catalysts for HER
catalysis in a wide range of pH conditions. They first employed DFT
calculations to predict the positive effect of incorporating Ru into
Ni2P species. The simulated Ni2P–Ru cluster
(Figure 7a) almost
reached the optimal adsorption free energy of intermediate H* with
theΔGH* value of 0.01 eV (Figure 7b).

Encouraged by the theoretical prediction, a multiheterogeneous
Ni@Ni2P–Ru nanorod was then prepared. Synchrotron-based
X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES and EXAFS) measurements suggested
that the introduction of Ru into Ni@Ni2P can modulate the
phosphatization process of Ni, through a Ru–Ni coordination
effect.

Meanwhile, the introduced Ru is extremely beneficial
to the retention
of metallic Ni, which ensures great conductivity in a satisfactory
catalyst system. The evaluation of electrocatalytic activity confirmed
that the Ni@Ni2P–Ru possessed excellent HER activity
in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. The Ni@Ni2P–Ru
required low overpotentials of 51 and 41 mV, respectively, to obtain
10 mA cm–2, and showed small Tafel slopes of 35
mV dec–1 and 41 mV dec–1 in 0.5
M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH.

3.3 Iridium (Ir)-Metal-Based Catalysts
Iridium (Ir), with its weak hydrogen binding energy, was first selected
for the chemisorption of hydrogen.24 In
a hydrogen adsorption/desorption test, Ir with a specific (111) facet
is thermally stable and exhibits relatively balanced hydrogen adsorption/desorption
capacity, comparable to Pt(100).24 Its
position near the top of the HER volcano plot ensures that Ir receives
considerable attention as a viable alternative to Pt.2,14

Both experiments and theoretical calculations have confirmed
that having optimal hydrogen adsorption energy is a prerequisite for
an efficient HER catalyst, depending on the HER reaction mechanism.14 Probing the hydrogen adsorption/desorption behaviors
of catalysts is thus crucial for the development of active HER catalysts.12,23 Li et al.25 chose Ir(111) as a theoretical
model to study its behavior of hydrogen chemisorption. Ir NPs can
be tailored using an electronegative carbon/nitrogen (C/N) matrix,
exposing an Ir(111) crystalline facet. A previous study suggested
that d orbitals have a huge effect on hydrogen adsorption/desorption
on the surface of transition metals.20 The
projected DOS distributions with hydrogen adsorbates, Ir and IrNC,
reveal that the surficial Ir sites on IrNC have stronger hydrogen
bonding (Figure 8a–c).

calculations for hydrogen adsorption on Ir and IrNC.

H on the Ir sites of IrNC. (d) Free energy diagram of Ir and IrNC.

Considering the whole HER reaction pathway, the
large upslope value
of 0.25 eV at Ir sites can be reduced to 0.04 eV by balancing the
electronegative environment with C/N sites. This is even lower than
the value for Pt (0.09 eV). In that case, the hydrogen bonding energy
on the surface of IrNC would be better optimized to be more favorable
for the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in water splitting.

To
date, considerable progress has been achieved using DFT calculations
and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces.10,20 One of the notable discoveries is that a monolayer admetal will
interact with a parent metal substrate, modifying the surface d-band
center, which further influences the adsorption energy of bimetallic
structures, enabling access to unprecedented chemical properties.
Guo et al.17 reported an Ir-tungsten (W)
alloy with a nanodendritic structure (IrW ND) as an efficient catalyst
toward a pH-universal HER application. Because of the different HER
mechanisms in acid and alkaline conditions (Figure 9a), free energy diagrams based on first-principles
calculations were separately developed to investigate the superior
HER activity on IrW NDs. Using the binding energies of H (EH) and OH (EOH)
as an indicator (Figure 9b), the IrW-Site1 was determined to have a weaker binding energy
than Pt (Figure 9c).
Its moderate strength makes IrW a promising catalyst in acid environments,
according to the Sabatier principle.26

solutions. (a) Schematic HER reaction step on the surface of IrW NDs

Likewise, the IrW also exhibited lower binding
energies of 0.34
and 0.61 eV, respectively, for water dissociation and dissociated
OH bonding energy (Figure 9d), outperforming Pt (0.75 and 0.88 eV) and Ir (0.77 and 1.13
eV). The lower barrier value of IrW is associated with the stronger
affinity of the W active site to OH in alkaline conditions. In combination,
these features enabled IrW to exhibit better HER activity than Pt
or Ir in both acidic and alkaline environments. This result was also
supported by DFT calculations, which confirmed the stronger adsorption
of H on Ir active sites and the higher affinity of OH to the surface
W of IrW.

Except for the metal–metal interaction, which
is responsible
for enhanced HER catalytic activity, the heteroatom is also suggested
as a crucial component to tune the electrocatalytic performance of
the noble-metal-based electrocatalyst because of its intrinsic electronegativity.
Nitrogen-doped porous carbon not only serves as an ideal matrix to
anchor and prevent aggregation of active noble metal atoms/particles
during the pyrolysis process but also coordinates with the noble metal
atom to modify the electronic structure of the catalyst. Nanosized
iridium nanoparticles loaded on nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (Ir@N-G-750)
are reported with pronounced HER activity in both acidic and alkaline
conditions.27 Unlike the well-acknowledged
role emphasized on the whole nitrogen atom, a specific type of N atom
is reported to effectively affect the interfacial property of Ir.

DFT calculations illustrate that the formation of pyridinic N could
remarkably reduce the adhesion energy of nitrogen-doped carbon species
(Figure 10a). Once
the Ir cluster is introduced into the N–graphene system, the
distance of the adjacent N atom is minimized and starts to form the
Ir–N site. The Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on
Ir–N is herein tuned by the favorable active pyridinic N (−0.46
eV) adhered on the Ir surface (Figure 10b), compared to the Ir–pyrrole N
(−0.77 eV) and the pure Ir–graphene site (−2.72
eV) (Figure 10c,d).
Thus, N-doping is beneficial for improved HER electrocatalytic performance.

4 Conclusion and Perspectives
In this
mini-review, we have focused on the most recent developments
of noble metal (Pt, Ru, and Ir)-based materials as promising catalysts
toward HER. Pt with moderate price and relatively poor stability has
been the most widely studied as HER electrocatalysts with superior
activity in a wide pH range. Ru with the lowest price and high stability
is explored as an excellent HER electrocatalyst to produce hydrogen
in both acid and alkaline conditions, specifically when it is on the
N-doped porous carbon matrix. Ir with the highest price and stability
can be adopted as an ideal model to study the chemisorption of hydrogen
during the HER process. Several strategies have been exploited to
address the high cost and instability issues of those materials, including
downsizing the noble metals to single-atom catalysts, forming alloys,
or hybridizing with other inexpensive transition metals and interface
engineering. By modifying the catalysts’ surface hydrogen adsorption
behavior, those methods have greatly improved the performance of noble-metal-based
catalysts. Still, challenges remain in the development of highly active
noble-metal-based catalysts. For single-atom catalysts (SACs), active
sites remain elusive and may originate from the synergistic effect
of complex structures on the carbon matrix and the electronic properties
of the SACs. In addition, the relatively lower density, easily transferred
nature, as well as the undesirable tendency to the aggregation need
to be further resolved in SACs. The preparation of noble-metal-based
alloys is much more complex and challenging, and many of the proposed
bimetallic structures tend to change during the reaction. Thus, identifying
the atomic arrangement of alloy catalysts is critical, using some
powerful characterization methods, such as in situ spectroscopic or
microscopic techniques and/or EXAFS. Interface engineering strategies
can lead to metal segregation and diffusion under reaction conditions,
especially during long-term stability tests. Further experimental
and theoretical efforts are necessary to minimize the gap between
water splitting and hydrocarbon reforming, for highly efficient hydrogen
production.
