Layer
exchange growth of amorphous carbon (a-C) is a unique technique
for fabricating high-quality multilayer graphene (MLG) on insulators
at low temperatures. We investigated the effects of the a-C/Ni multilayer
structure on the quality of MLG formed by Ni-induced layer exchange.
The crystal quality and electrical conductivity of MLG improved dramatically
as the number of a-C/Ni multilayers increased. A 600 °C-annealed
sample in which 15 layers of 4-nm-thick a-C and 0.5-nm-thick Ni were
laminated recorded an electrical conductivity of 1430 S/cm. This value
is close to that of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite synthesized
at approximately 3000 °C. This improvement is likely related
to the bond weakening in a-C due to the screening effect of Ni. We
expect that these results will contribute to low-temperature synthesis
of MLG using a solid-phase reaction with metals.

Introduction
The technology to synthesize graphene
on arbitrary substrates is
essential to combine advanced electronic devices and carbon materials.1 Mechanical transfer has allowed for high-crystallinity
graphene on insulators; however, concerns regarding imperfections
in graphene, such as wrinkles, remain. This has motivated researchers
to develop a transfer-free process for practical applications. Moreover,
for devices which can endure large currents or heat, thick multilayer
graphene (MLG) is preferable to few-layer graphene.2−4 For example,
low-resistance wiring requires a thickness of tens of nanometers to
replace Cu wiring in large-scale integrated circuits, whereas a heat
spreader requires a thickness of more than several micrometers, depending
on the type of device. Vapor deposition techniques (e.g., chemical
vapor deposition5−10 and plasma-assisted vapor deposition11,12) are the most
promising ways to grow MLG directly on insulators. However, forming
thick, uniform MLG is difficult. Conversely, metal-induced solid-phase
crystallization of amorphous carbon (a-C) or polymers has been actively
studied for the direct synthesis of MLG on insulators.13−27 Some of these techniques have enabled the synthesis of thick (>5
nm) MLG by controlling the initial thickness of a-C.18−27 However, further investigations are required to achieve high-quality
MLG on insulators.

Recently, we developed metal-induced layer
exchange (MILE) of a-C.28−32 In particular, MILE using Ni enabled us to synthesize uniform MLG
at low temperature with a wide range of thicknesses.29,32 Higashi et al. reported the effects of an a-Ge/Au multilayer structure
on the layer exchange between Au and Ge.33,34 The grain size of the resulting Ge layer was significantly improved
by using the multilayer structure. The improvement was attributed
to the diffusion of Ge atoms promoted by the bond weakening of a-Ge
due to the screening effect.35,36 In this study, we have
applied the multilayer structure to the Ni-induced layer exchange
of a-C, which has improved the crystal quality and electrical conductivity
of the resulting MLG layer dramatically.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the schematic of the sample preparation procedure. A Ni thin film
(60 nm thickness) was prepared on quartz glass (SiO2) substrates.
Subsequently, a-C/Ni multilayers were prepared, where the number of
a-C layers n was 1, 3, 5, and 15. The thickness of
the Ni layers between the a-C layers were fixed at 0.5 nm. Each a-C
layer thickness t was 60 nm for n = 1, 20 nm for n = 3, 12 nm for n = 5, and 4 nm for n = 15, as summarized in Table 1. Therefore, the total
thickness of a-C layers was fixed at 60 nm.

sample preparation procedure. (b) Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image and (c) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectrum of the sample for n = 15 nm and t = 4 annealed at 600 °C after Ni removal. The EDX
spectrum was obtained in a field of view of 1 mm square.

a Total thickness
of the a-C layer
is 60 nm.

Figure 1b shows
that MLG covers almost all of the substrate, although there are some
voids. Such void formation can be suppressed by increasing the film
thickness ratio of a-C to Ni.30Figure 1c shows the peaks
corresponding to C, Si, and O. These elements originate from the MLG
layer and SiO2 substrate because the detection depth is
greater than 1 μm in the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement.
Note that the Ni concentration in the MLG layer is less than the EDX
detection limit (∼1%), which will be low enough not to contribute
to the electrical conductivity σ. Such low metal contamination
in the resulting layer is a typical feature of MILE, which is limited
by solid solubility.31

We investigated
the detailed cross-sectional structure of the sample
for n = 15 and t = 4 annealed at
600 °C. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) sample was prepared by the conventional focused ion beam method.
The bright-field TEM image in Figure 2a and the elemental map in Figure 2b show that a single Ni layer is uniformly
stacked on a single C layer. We note that there is no remnant of the
a-C/Ni multilayer prepared on the upper part before annealing. The
selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Figure 2c reveals that C{002} planes
in MLG are oriented almost parallel to the SiO2 substrate.
Compared to using a single a-C layer,29 the current MLG has less ripple and higher quality. As shown in Figure 2d, the dark-field
TEM image shows a bright contrast of the MLG layer in the entire region,
which also indicates that MLG is highly (002) oriented. The high-resolution
TEM image in Figure 2e shows that the lower part of MLG consists of small graphene layers,
whereas Figure 2f shows
that the upper part consists of relatively large graphene layers.
The insertion of an AlOx interlayer between
the a-C/Ni multilayer and Ni will further improve the crystal quality
of MLG.30,32

images showing the (e) lower and (f) upper parts of the MLG layer,
respectively.

Figure 3a shows
that Raman spectra of the back side of the samples have peaks at approximately
1350, 1580, and 2700 cm–1, corresponding to the
disordered mode (D), graphitic mode (G), and D mode overtone (2D)
peaks in the graphitic structure, respectively.37 This means that layer exchange between the C and Ni layers
occurred, and MLG formed on the SiO2 substrate in all samples.
The intensity ratio of the G to D peaks (IG/ID) in Raman spectra corresponds to
the crystal quality of MLG.37Figure 3b shows that the IG/ID ratio increases
as n increases for both annealing temperatures. The IG/ID ratio reaches
the highest value of approximately 8 for the sample for n = 15 and t = 4 annealed at 600 °C. This result
suggests that the crystal quality of MLG improves as n increases. According to previous studies on Au-induced layer exchange
of Ge, the crystal quality improvement by the multilayer structure
is attributed to the grain size enlargement due to the Ge diffusion
enhancement.33,34Figure 3c indicates that σ also increases as n increases for both annealing temperatures. This behavior
clearly reflects the crystal quality of the MLG found in the Raman
study (Figure 3b).
The 600 °C sample has a higher σ than the 800 °C sample
for n ≥ 3. This behavior is likely attributed
to the larger grain size due to the lower growth temperature, which
is well known for layer exchange. σ exhibits the maximum value
of 1430 S/cm in a sample, where n = 15 and t = 4, annealed at 600 °C. This value is close to that
of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (1700 S/cm) synthesized at approximately
3000 °C. According to our previous paper,32 σ can be improved to 2700 S/cm by inserting an AlOx interlayer and controlling the MLG thickness.
By combining these techniques, σ will further improve.

Ni removal, as a function of n and t.

Conclusions
Adoption of the a-C/Ni
multilayer structure greatly influenced
the quality of MLG formed by layer exchange. The IG/ID ratio in Raman spectra
and σ of MLG dramatically improved as the number of a-C/Ni multilayers
increased. This behavior is likely because the higher number of multilayers
provided the stronger screening effect and then the higher diffusion
rate of C atoms into Ni, resulting in the larger grain size of MLG.
Therefore, the present study is expected to contribute to low-temperature
synthesis of MLG using solid-phase reaction with metals.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
All depositions were carried out
using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering (base pressure: 3.0
× 10–4 Pa) with Ar plasma. The substrate temperature
was 200 °C for Ni and room temperature for a-C/Ni multilayer.
The RF power was set to 100 W for a-C and 50 W for Ni. The samples
were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h and 800 °C for 10 min in
ambient Ar to form MLG on the substrate by layer exchange. To remove
the Ni that moved to the top layer, the sample was dipped in a diluted
HNO3 solution (2.0% HNO3) for 10 min.

Material
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analyses and EDX spectroscopy were performed using Hitachi High-Technologies
SU-8020 and JEOL JEO-2300. TEM analyses were performed using an analytical
TEM, FEI Tecnai Osiris operating at 200 kV, equipped with an EDX spectrometer
(FEI Super-X system). Raman spectroscopy was performed using JASCO
NRS-5100, wherein the laser wavelength was 532 nm and the spot size
was 5 μm. The σ was evaluated by the van der Pauw method
using a Bio-Rad HL5500PC system and averaged over five measurements
for each sample.
