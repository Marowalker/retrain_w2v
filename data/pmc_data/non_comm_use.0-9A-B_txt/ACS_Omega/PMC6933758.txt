Commercially available spinel cobalt blue (CoAl2O4) utilizes a significant amount of carcinogenic Co2+, which makes its synthesis more hazardous and environmentally
harmful.
Considerable effort has been put into developing more environmentally
benign and robust blue pigments to replace cobalt blue. A new class
of blue pigments with tunable hue were prepared. The solid solution
series, CaAl12–2xCoxTixO19 (0
< x ≤ 1), crystallizes in a hexagonal mineral
hibonite (CaM12O19) structure with five distinct
crystallographic sites for M cations (M = Al, Co, and Ti). The origin
of intense blue color is attributed to a synergistic effect of allowed d–d transitions involving the chromophore Co2+ in both tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal crystal fields.
Compared with commercial cobalt blue, these tunable hibonite blues
possess a reddish hue that intensifies the blue color as observed
in Y(In,Mn)O3 (YInMn) blues, with a significant reduction
of Co2+ concentration from 33% to as low as 4% by mass.
A significant advantage of hibonite blues over cobalt blue is the
substantial reduction in carcinogenic cobalt content while enhancing
the color properties at a reduced cost for raw materials.

Introduction
For thousands of years, civilizations
around the world have sought
inorganic materials that could be used to paint things blue, often
with very limited success.1,2 Discoveries of durable
new inorganic blue colorants are rare occurrences in materials science.
The first ancient blue material discovered was lapis lazuli, which
was about 6000 years ago. It was more expensive than gold. Egyptians
and Babylonians utilized naturally occurring lapis lazuli stones found
in Afghanistan to make rudimentary blues. It was not until 1826 a
chemical process for developing synthetic lapis lazuli (now called
ultramarine blue, Na7Al6Si6O24S3) was identified.2 In 1706, Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3) was accidentally made by a German dye-maker Johann Jacob Diesbach.2 Although cobalt blue containing mixtures had
long been used in Chinese porcelain,3 the
pure cobalt blue (CoAl2O4) pigment was independently
synthesized by a French chemist in 1802.4 Nearly two centuries later, YInMn blue (YIn1–xMnxO3) was
serendipitously discovered when searching for magnetodielectric materials
for electronics and sparked renewed worldwide interest in pigment
discoveries.2,5 Most of these compounds suffer
from stability, cost, color, or toxicity issues. The origin of color
in ultramarine blue is from a charge transfer within an unstable S3– cluster, which decomposes under mild acidic
conditions and with time. Prussian blue is dark and dull because of
a charge transfer between Fe2+ and Fe3+ and
is unsuitable for many coloring applications. The YInMn blue family
of pigments are durable and possess remarkable heat reflecting properties,
which make them excellent candidates for energy-saving coatings, nonetheless
they are not considered cost-effective for widespread general coating
applications.2,6

The intensity of the color,
ease of synthesis, and wide applicability
have resulted in CoAl2O4 becoming a dominant
commercial blue pigment for the last 200 years. CoAl2O4 gives an intense bright blue color because of tetrahedral
Co2+ spin-allowed d–d4A2(4F)–4T1(4P) transitions between 500 and 700 nm. CoAl2O4, which contains 33% Co2+ by mass, is expensive
and environmentally unfriendly to produce. Finding replacement compounds
that have the same durability, intensity, and hue of blue has proven
even more difficult. The intensity of color generally scales with
the chromophore composition; however, reducing cobalt content is infeasible
in the CoAl2O4 spinel structure without significant
loss in coloration. The search for materials with similar local environments
for chromophores has led to the exploration of other crystal structures
as color-producing hosts. The mineral hibonite, known as “blue
angel”, has light blue coloration because of a charge transfer
between Ti3+ and O2–. Hibonite, with
the general formula CaM12O19, has five distinct
crystallographic M sites, including three different octahedra, a set
of tetrahedra, and a set of trigonal bipyramids (TBPs), where the
metal center, M, is in pseudotetrahedral coordination, offset from
the trigonal plane (Figure 1). Hibonites crystallize into a hexagonal crystal structure,
with spinel blocks identical to CoAl2O4 separated
by an “R” block with TBPs, face-shared octahedral M
sites, and Ca2+ sites.7 The
tetrahedral and TBP sites are of interest because they are noncentrosymmetric
and therefore may produce intense transitions as found in YIn1–xMnxO3 and CoAl2O4.5,8 A
previous work has discovered many different colors in hibonite compounds;
however, the resulting blue colors are less intense than CoAl2O4.9−14

Figure 1 Schematic
of the unit cell of hibonite. Symmetrically distinct
sites are shown in different colors: light green (M1) and yellow (M5):
edge-shared octahedra; red (M4): face-shared octahedra; light blue
(M2): TBPs; dark blue (M3): tetrahedra.

We have investigated the effects of systematic
Co2+/Ti4+ substitution into the hibonite structure
and have found
that Co2+ gives rise to an intense, tunable blue coloration
with up to x = 1 Co2+ (CaAl12–2xCoxTixO19, 8% Co2+ by mass). This coloration
at such low Co2+ concentrations is characteristic because
of the unique effect of the cosubstituted Ti4+ within the
hibonite structure. This color is tunable through varying Co2+ concentration as well as cosubstitution with other transition metals,
such as Ni2+, Mn3+, and Cr3+.

Results and Discussion
Addition of Co2+ and
Ti4+ increases the unit
cell parameters because of the increased size of Co2+ and
Ti4+ over Al3+ (Figure 2a).15 The deep
blue hues seen in hibonites originate in the strong site preference
of Co2+ and Ti4+ substitution, affirmed by structural
analysis of neutron diffraction data of CaAl10.6Co0.7Ti0.7O19 and CaAl10CoTiO19 (Figure 2b). The face-shared octahedral sites are the primary occupied sites
of Ti4+ for both compositions (Table 1). This is consistent with what was found
in the CaAl12–2xNixTixO19 hibonites,
with the primary difference being the increased site preference of
Co2+ for the tetrahedral and TBP sites compared to Ni2+.9 Of the three octahedral coordination
environments available in the structure (Figure 1), only the face-shared octahedral site is
capable of a site distortion.11 Because
of the larger size and greater charge of Ti4+ over Al3+, a distortion must occur in order to satisfy valency. Therefore,
Ti4+ distributes primarily into the face-shared octahedral
environment where the local structure around the site can allow the
metal to displace away from the shared face of the other octahedron.
Neutron structure analysis reveals that 76 and 70% of Co2+ are in the tetrahedral site for CaAl10.6Co0.7Ti0.7O19 and CaAl10CoTiO19, respectively. A significant amount of Co2+ also resides
in the TBP site, 24 and 17% of all Co2+ for CaAl10.6Co0.7Ti0.7O19 and CaAl10CoTiO19, respectively, with no Co2+ occupying
the M1 edge-shared octahedral or M4 face-shared octahedral sites in
either composition. Co2+ occupies the M5 edge-shared octahedral
site in small amounts only in the CaAl10CoTiO19 composition.

The Co2+ ion displays a strong preference
for the tetrahedral
coordination environment, even though the crystal field stabilization
energy for octahedral Co2+ is higher. This may be because
the d7 electron configuration of Co2+ favors a weak Jahn–Teller distortion in octahedral
coordination, which is unavailable in the hibonite structure.16 Neither the TBP nor the tetrahedral environments
require a Jahn–Teller distortion for d7; however, the tetrahedral site has a much higher percent
of Co2+ in both compositions refined. This is attributed
to the displacement of the metal center of the TBP away from the trigonal
plane. This displacement creates a pseudotetrahedral environment,
which is smaller than the real tetrahedral site and thus less likely
to be occupied by the larger Co2+ ion. The total TBP occupancy
in both refined compositions is similar, despite the difference in
the molar percent of cobalt out of all sites. This suggests that the
TBP site becomes saturated by Co2+ at low concentrations
of Co2+.

This site preference is much more pronounced
in CaAl12–2xCoxTixO19 than in the previously
investigated CaAl12–2xNixTixO19 or
Ca1–xLaxAl12–xNixO19.9 The high spin d8 electron
configuration of Ni2+ may contribute to this reduced preference
as octahedral crystal field stabilization energy is much larger than
in Co2+.

The color of these materials has been evaluated
by L*a*b* color
measurements. L*a*b* uses three primary
numbers to quantify the brightness (L*), green-red
(a*), and blue-yellow (b*) values.
Higher L* values are the result of brighter colors
with higher light reflectivity. Positive a* values
correspond to more red coloration while more negative b* values are more blue. Hibonite blue pigments give intense negative b* blue values rivaling that of CoAl2O4 and approaching that of YInMn blue (Table 2). We have found that, while CoAl2O4 gives no red hue like YInMn blue, Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 substituted hibonite blues to give more reddish
hues, approaching that of lapis lazuli stones and YInMn blue. These
reddish hues are unobtainable with CoAl2O4 spinel,
as reduction in Co2+ content by substitution in the spinel
system only reduces the intensity of blue coloration and has no effect
on hue. Introduction of other chromophores, such as Ni2+, into the Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 hibonites reduces
this redness and adds certain greenish hues to the hibonite blue.
Material brightness can often be tuned through chromophore concentration;
however, only recently, Y(In,Mn,Ti,Zn)O3 has been shown
to have a tunable hue.17,18 This tunability is rare in blue
pigments and shows that hibonite blue can be used as a versatile pigment
with multiple hues to suit various needs. The CaAl10CoTiO19 composition was chosen for acid and base stability tests.
Specimens of CaAl10CoTiO19 were soaked in either
50% HNO3 or 1 M NaOH for 12 h, filtered, and examined via L*a*b* color measurements
and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns (Figure 3) show no change in structure and L*a*b* measurements reveal
no change in color. This is consistent with other hibonites, which
have high acid/base stability; therefore, we believe that Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 hibonites are also stable in most pH environments.

Neutron structure analysis reveals that 70% of Co2+ is
in the tetrahedral site. The origin of the color of Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 hibonite blue is therefore primarily due to
a strong d–d transition of tetrahedral Co2+ between 500 and 675 nm (Figure 4a). The spectroscopy of Co2+ in
tetrahedral coordination of oxides has been well studied, and the
broadening of the 4A2(4F)–4T1(4P) Co2+ transition has
been explained through spin–orbit interactions of the d7 ions.19 Typically,
this gives rise to three noticeable transitions in the visible region,
as is the case of CoAl2O4. However, we found
that Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 hibonite has four transitions
within the same 500–675 nm region. This difference may be due
to the distortion of the tetrahedral site in the hibonite that cannot
exist in the cubic CoAl2O4 spinel.20 This, however, does not explain the nearly identical
intensity of the color of hibonite blue compared to CoAl2O4. Despite a decrease in Co2+ concentration
from 33% by mass to as low as 4% by mass, hibonite blue maintains
a dramatic blue coloration. Both the tetrahedral and TBP Co2+ may give rise to the intense absorption between 500 and 675 nm,
as the TBP environment is more accurately described as a set of disordered
face-shared tetrahedra, where the disordered site is offset from the
face by approximately 0.28 Å. These pseudotetrahedra are smaller
in volume than the tetrahedral site, giving the larger Co2+ ion preference for the tetrahedral site. The combined TBP and tetrahedral
Co2+ then gives the spectrum seen in the Ca(Al,Co,Ti)12O19 hibonite. Indeed, substitution of Ni2+ for Co2+ reduces this absorption because of the decrease
in site preference of Ni2+ for the tetrahedral and TBP
environments as well as the difference in electron configuration.9 The brightness of hibonite blues (Figure 5) is affected by both the Co2+ and Ti4+ substitutions. The strong absorption
in the UV region (250 nm) is the result of a metal–ligand charge
transfer between Ti4+ and O2–, which
at higher Ti4+ concentrations tails into the visible region,
darkening the color. This effect is also seen in other hibonites.

Co blue (CoAl2O4) was measured for comparison.

Lastly, we investigated the usefulness of hibonite
blue as a near-infrared
(NIR) reflective material. NIR reflectivity is a property necessary
for compounds to be used as energy-saving heat reflection colorants
(“cool pigments”) and is the subject of increasing interest.21 Current blue pigments containing cobalt, such
as CoAl2O4, have very low NIR reflectivity.
This is due to two d–d transitions for tetrahedral Co2+, 4A2(4F)–4T2(4F) at 1400 nm and 4A2(4F)–4T1(4F) at 1600
nm.22 The high concentration of Co2+ in CoAl2O4 gives a large absorption
in the NIR region. Thus, most Co2+-containing compounds
have very low NIR reflectivity, making them unsuitable for energy-saving
coatings. The hibonite blues (e.g., CaAl11Co0.5Ti0.5O19) show an increase in NIR reflectivity
by as much as 60% between 1200 and 1600 nm and as high as 125% increase
between 800 and 1000 nm while still maintaining the intense blue color
(Figure 4b).

Conclusions
We have found that hibonite blues are stable
in both strongly acidic
and basic environments, with no change in structure or color after
treatment. This rivals the durability of both cobalt blue and YInMn
blue. Furthermore, with increasing Co/Ti content, there is increasing
ultraviolet absorbance because of the Ti–O charge transfer.
UV radiation is a common degradant of polymer coatings. Additives,
such as inorganic UV-absorbing pigments, are added to reduce this
organic degradation. Both cobalt blue and YInMn blue were shown to
be useful as functional colorants in this regard.6 Similarly, the UV absorption of hibonite blue makes it
an excellent candidate for polymer-based coating applications.

Discoveries of blue pigments are still scarce as no criteria for
investigations of novel systems exist. Despite the abundance of weakly
blue cobalt-containing compounds, we could not have foreseen the intensity
of color and redness coming from hibonite blue. Predicting the exact
color of new materials remains the realm of intuitive guess-work rather
than science.23

Methods
Stoichiometric amounts of CaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.0%),
Al2O3 (Cerac, 99.99%), CoCO3 (Baker
Analytical, 99%), and TiO2 (Cerac, 99%) were ground in
an agate mortar, pressed into pills, and heated between 1623 and 1773
K over 12 h. Intermittent grinding and reheating were implemented
to ensure sample purity and homogeneity. Compositions for the formula,
CaAl12–2xCoxTixO19, were x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0. Phase purity
and unit cell parameters were determined using powder XRD on a bench-top
Rigaku Miniflex II powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
and a graphite monochromator. Neutron powder diffraction data were
obtained from the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology to investigate chemical composition and
site occupancies. Samples were loaded into vanadium canisters, and
data were collected at room temperature using a Cu(311) monochromator
yielding a 1.54 Å wavelength. Initial structures were refined
using GSAS EXPGUI software. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopic data
were collected in the UV–vis region on an in-house spectrometer
with MgO as a reference. The reflectance data were converted to absorbance
with the Kubelka–Munk equation. NIR reflectance measurements
were performed using a Jasco V-670 spectrometer up to 2500 nm. Color
coordinates in the CIELAB color space were measured using a Konica
Minolta CM-700d spectrophotometer. Samples of CaAl10CoTiO19 were soaked in 50% HNO3 and 1 M NaOH overnight
and dried, and their color properties and phase purity were determined
via XRD in order to determine acid and base resistance.
