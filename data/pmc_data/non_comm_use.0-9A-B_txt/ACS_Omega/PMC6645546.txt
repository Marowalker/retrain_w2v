High-thermal-conductivity
and low-dielectric-loss polymer nanocomposites
have gained tremendous attention in microelectronics technology. Against
this background, the present study deals with the development of a
high-thermal-conductivity, low-dielectric-constant, and low-loss polymer
nanocomposite based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated boron
nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) as the filler in poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) matrix. The nanocomposites were prepared through a facile solution-blending
process. Elemental mapping of the prepared nanocomposite indicates
the uniform distribution of filler particle in PMMA matrix. An impressive
high-thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of around 363% was achieved
for nanocomposite of 0.35 Vf of hybrid
filler (1.48 W/m K) compared to pristine PMMA (0.32 W/m K). The addition
of AgNP reduces the thermal contact resistance (Rc) by bridging individual BNNS, thereby improving thermal
transport. Measured TC values were fitted with a theoretical model
that showed good agreement. Dielectric measurements performed at radiofrequencies
and microwave frequencies revealed that the nanocomposites show a
low dielectric constant (<5), low loss (10–2),
and very low alternating current conductivity (10–7 S/cm). The results suggest that silver-decorated BNNS is a promising
hybrid filler for effective thermal management.

1 Introduction
Breathtaking
developments happening in consumer electronics and
personal computers have been demanding miniaturized components with
better speed and performance. Managing the circuit heat dissipation
is a vital issue that needs to be addressed urgently to improve the
reliability and performances of devices. Over the last few decades,
polymers have gained pronounced attention as substrates, owing to
their excellent design freedom, light weight, and low cost.1−3 But, they have genuine drawbacks like high coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE, 40–200 ppm/K) and low thermal conductivity
(TC, <0.5 W/m K),4 which debilitate
their wide range of electronic applications. The low thermal conductivity
of the substrate leads to inadequate heat dissipation, which adversely
affects the performance and lifetime of circuits. Here, the low thermal
conductivity results from high-thermal interface resistance caused
by the amorphous arrangement of polymer chains.5 Hence, reduction in thermal stresses and improvement in
heat removal are critical concerns in the current electronic substrate
and packaging applications.6−9 Although the prime concern is to improve the thermal
conductivity of polymeric materials, desired electrical resistivity
and mechanical properties should also not be compromised.

On
this aspect, the thermal conductivity of polymers can be enhanced
by incorporating high-thermal-conductivity fillers, such as metals
and carbonaceous and ceramic materials into the matrix. The properties
of polymer nanocomposites are governed by certain factors such as
chemical composition, shape, and orientation of filler in the polymer
matrix. The influence of the particle size and interaction of fillers
in the polymer matrix on the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties
of nanocomposites was well studied.10,11 Even though
carbon-based materials (carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene)12 and metals (silver, nickel)13 can increase the thermal conductivity, the high electrical
conductivity14 of these composites will
generate electric leakage in the substrate, which tends to limit their
practical use in electronic packaging systems. On the other hand,
thermally conducting yet electrically insulating ceramic materials,
such as oxides [alumina (Al2O3),15 beryllium oxide (BeO),14 zinc oxide (ZnO)16], nitrides [aluminum
nitride (AlN),17−21 boron nitride (BN),22,23 silicon nitride (Si3N4)] and a few carbides [silicon carbide (SiC)],24 are good choices for thermal management applications.
Among these, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) took a lead role due to
its excellent properties like large surface area, high-thermal transport,
and chemical inertness.25−27 It is also a good electrical
insulator having a wide band gap of ∼6 eV.28,29 Besides, the thermal conductivity of bulk h-BN is found to be as
high as 400 W/m K at room temperature.30,31 A theoretical
estimation revealed that the value of thermal conductivity of BN nanoribbons
can reach up to 3000 W/m K.32 Contrast
to other nanofillers, two-dimensional h-BN nanosheets (BNNSs) with
exposed (002) plane can enhance the phonon transfer, thereby increasing
the thermal conductivity.22 Moreover, the
aspect ratio of BNNS is large enough to obtain good thermal transport
even at low filler loading.5,33,34 Incorporating h-BN as nanofiller, thermal conductivity improvement
of several polymeric systems (epoxy,35−39 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),7,40,41 poly(vinyl butyral)1) has been reported earlier.42

Nowadays,
apart from the use of single filler, hybrid fillers are
also successfully used to improve the thermal conductivity of polymers.
Recently, Wang et al. have reported nanosilver-decorated BNNS as a
hybrid filler to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy-based nanocomposites.35,43 In 2016, Xia et al. reported natural fiber–h-BN hybrid filler-reinforced
epoxy composites with improved thermal and mechanical properties.44 By virtue of bioinspired engineering, Yao et
al. developed poly(vinyl alcohol)–paper composite with enhanced
thermal conductivity by utilizing BNNS/AgNP/SiC nanowire as the hybrid
filler.45 High-performance composites with
high-thermal conductivity, good flame retardancy, and low dielectric
loss were fabricated using hybrid fillers consisting of aluminum nitride
and multiwalled carbon nanotubes in cyanate ester matrix.46 The improved performance of hybrid filler is
arguably due to its synergetic effect with tuning compatibility and
enhanced connectivity obtained from the corresponding fillers.47

In the present work, silver nanoparticle-decorated
BNNS were taken
as the hybrid filler to improve the thermal conductivity of PMMA nanocomposites,
while maintaining their high electrical resistivity. PMMA is a transparent
thermoplastic polymer, and its ceramic composite was extensively studied
for electronic applications.48−50 Here, we have systematically
compared the properties of PMMA–BNNS nanocomposite phases (abbreviated
as PMMA–BX) with PMMA–Ag-decorated
BNNS nanocomposites (abbreviated as PMMA–BAX). Interestingly, PMMA–BAX nanocomposites
show high-thermal conductivity compared to neat PMMA as well as PMMA–BX-based composites. Furthermore, the developed PMMA–BAX nanocomposite shows low dielectric constant and appreciably
low dielectric loss with improved mechanical strength. The results
reveal that the concentration of silver nanoparticles on BNNS can
be very low enough to form conducting percolation channels. At the
same time, it facilitates connections between the exfoliated BNNS,
whereby the mechanism of transfer of phonons gets intensified. Thus,
the PMMA–BAX nanocomposite is suggested as
an attractive candidate for thermal management applications in the
electronic packaging industry.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization of BNNS and BNNS/AgNP
The
crystal structure of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) is very
much similar to that of graphene, which consists of layered structure
comprising a network of (BN)3 rings that were held together
by van der Waals bonds. Crystallinity, phase purity, and deposition
of AgNP over BNNS were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns
of liquid-exfoliated BNNS and BNNS/AgNP. It is evident from the pattern
that BNNS are completely phase-pure and no impurity phases were present.
Both BNNS and BNNS/AgNP show identical diffraction peaks corresponding
to the (002), (100), (101), (102), (004), (104), (110), and (112)
crystallographic planes of hexagonal boron nitride. All peaks could
be well indexed using standard ICDD pattern of h-BN (00-034-0421),
and it belongs to the P63/mmc space group. The XRD pattern of
hybrid filler shows a characteristic peak (111) (represented by an
asterisk) originated from the silver nanoparticles, which indicates
the presence of silver nanoparticles over BNNS.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of BNNS
and BNNS/AgNP.

Surface morphologies
of BNNS and BNNS/AgNP were studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques.
The exfoliated BNNS comprise isolated flat nanosheets, as shown in Figure 2a,b as low-magnification
TEM images. Figure 2c,d shows a high-resolution micrograph and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern of BNNS, respectively. As seen from Figure 2c, the lattice fringes
were clearly visible, indicating the highly crystalline nature of
exfoliated BNNS. The d-spacing of BNNS was calculated
from these lattice fringes as 3.6 Å, corresponding to the reflections
from (002) plane. The representative fast Fourier transform (FFT)
pattern is shown in the inset of Figure 2b, which reaffirms that the diffraction was
from (002) plane. Figure 2d is the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern,
which reveals that BNNS hold a sixfold symmetry that was not impaired
during exfoliation. Moreover, TEM images of silver nanoparticle-decorated
BNNS are shown in Figure 2e–h. From these images, one can observe that no individual
silver nanoparticle was found beside BNNS, which confirms that the
silver nanoparticles were more or less uniformly distributed over
BNNS. Figure 2h shows
that the interplanar spacing of the silver nanoparticle lattice is
about 2.3 Å, which well matched with the d-value
of the (111) plane of silver.

and (inset to (b))
FFT patterns of the corresponding image. (c) High-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image. (d) SAED pattern. (e–h) Low- and high-magnification
TEM images of BNNS/AgNP.

The lateral size (edge-to-edge) and sheet thickness of BNNS
were
calculated from representative atomic force micrography images. Figures 3a and 3b show the topographic images of exfoliated BNNS, suggesting
that the lateral size comes around 190 nm. The thicknesses were estimated
from the height profile given as inset to Figure 3b, which is of the order of 2.4 nm, corresponding
to about five to eight nanolayers.51Figures 3c and 3d represent the AFM images of hybrid filler, AgNP/BNNS, and
further confirm the uniform distribution of AgNP all over BNNS.

of PMMA–BAX and PMMA–BX nanocomposites respectively.

2.2 Thermal Conductivity of PMMA–BAX and PMMA–BX
To evaluate
their potential application in electronic packaging industry, thermal
conductivity analysis of the composites was carried out. Thermal conductivity
and thermal conductivity enhancement (TCE) of PMMA–BX and PMMA–BAX with various filler
loadings are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. From Figure 4a, it is evident that pure PMMA possesses a low thermal
conductivity of around 0.32 W/m K at room temperature, mainly due
to its amorphous nature. After the addition of fillers to pure polymer,
the thermal conductivity increased as a function of filler loading.
It is interesting to note from Figure 4a that the thermal conductivity of PMMA–B35
reaches a maximum value of 1.2 W/m K, whereas the hybrid filler (PMMA–BA35)
composites are found to offer better thermal conductivity (1.48 W/m
K) at room temperature. In general, the thermal conductivity of a
material can be enhanced by suppressing phonon scattering through
strong interfacial interactions.43 The
underlying mechanism behind the high-thermal conductivity achieved
by the hybrid filler (PMMA–BA35) compared to the PMMA–BX composite alone (PMMA–B35) is the capability of
silver nanoparticles to form bridges between the exfoliated BNNS providing
easy thermal conducting networks. Through this conducting path, transfer
of phonons is enhanced and consequently thermal transport resistance
gets minimized. However, there is no notable difference in the thermal
conductivities of PMMA–BX and PMMA–BAX at low Vf. This is because
at lower Vf the primary component in the
nanocomposite is the polymer matrix. Hence, the filler is completely
surrounded by PMMA and thus the silver nanoparticles cannot perform
effectively to form bridging between BNNS.35 After reaching a critical limit, say 0.25 Vf, there is a significant improvement in the TC of the PMMA–BAX composite compared to PMMA–BX,
indicating the effective connection of BNNS through AgNP. From the
above results, it can be concluded that the hybrid filler PMMA–BAX is more capable of heat dissipation compared to the PMMA–BX composites in electronic packaging.

A quantitative
analysis of the improvement in TC of the composites was conducted
by calculating thermal conductivity enhancement (TCE) by the formula 1  where κcomp is the TC of
the composite and κPMMA is the TC of pristine PMMA. Figure 4b shows TCE as a
function of Vf for both PMMA–BAX and PMMA–BX at room temperature.
As it is evident from Figure 4b, up to 0.15 Vf, there was not
much improvement in TCE compared to both PMMA–BAX and PMMA–BX. However, above the critical
limit of 0.25 Vf, TCE of PMMA–BAX shows an appreciable improvement compared to that of PMMA–BX. For instance, with 0.35 Vf, the TCE for the PMMA–BAX nanocomposite
is 363%, whereas that of PMMA–BX is almost 280% only. The
high value of TCE in the PMMA–BAX nanocomposite
suggests that the incorporation of AgNP can effectively improve the
thermal transport through BNNS.

We have attempted to compare
the apparent thermal conductivity
of composites with a suitable theoretical model. Several research
groups simulated thermal boundaries within nanofillers and theoretically
calculated thermal contact resistance between filler and polymer matrix.52−54 In the present work, a physical model proposed by Foygel et al.
was applied to calculate TC of polymer nanocomposites. The Foygel
physical model mainly considered the distribution of fillers and percolation
networks in the polymer matrix.55 Using
the following equation, thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites
can be theoretically calculated as 2  where K0 is a
pre-exponential factor depending on the effective thermal conductivity
of the filler networks, VC is the critical
volume fraction at the thermal percolation threshold, and t(α) is a conductivity exponent dependent on the aspect
ratio (α) of BNNS. In the present study, the aspect ratio of
BNNS was estimated mainly from AFM results. Using the above equation,
TC of nanocomposites was calculated and fitted with experimental data
with fitting parameters K0 and t(α), as shown in Figure 4c,d. For both PMMA–BX and PMMA–BAX composites, the fit follows most of the experimental values,
especially in high filler loadings, corroborating the good match between
experimental and theoretical results. The K0 was estimated to be 2.26 W/m K for PMMA–BX and 3.54 W/m K for PMMA–BAX nanocomposites.
Thermal contact resistance (Rc) can be
calculated from the following equation with the aid of K0 and t(α) as 3  The value
of Rc calculated for BNNS filler in the
PMMA–BX composite was 1.74 × 108 K/W, whereas that for BNNS/AgNP
hybrid filler in the PMMA–BAX composite was
1.02 × 108 K/W. From these values, one can observe
that in the absence of silver nanoparticles no bridge connections
were formed between nanosheets and thus the thermal barrier resistance
would be much higher. In the case of hybrid filler, an effective thermal
network was being created by AgNPs, which further reduce the thermal
contact resistance. This in turn will improve the thermal transport
and subsequently enhance the thermal conductivity as well.

Even
though the hybrid filler addition tends to enhance the TC
of the PMMA nanocomposite up to 363% in the present study, the improvement
is slightly less compared to early reports on the BNNS/AgNP/epoxy
nanocomposites, where a TCE of around 1120% was achieved.35 To untie this discrepancy, the densifications
of developed nanocomposites were analyzed because TC is directly proportional
to the density of the composite, and the results are given in Table 1. Theoretical densities
of all of the composites were calculated using mixture rule, taking
into account densities of PMMA and filler (BNNS for PMMA–BX and BNNS/Ag for PMMA–BAX) and
their volume fractions.

0.35	2.09	1.57	75	1.68	1.65	98	
In PMMA–BAX composites, the experimental
density increases from 1.15 to 1.57 g/cc when Vf increased from 0 to 0.35. However, the relative density (ratio
of experimental density to theoretical density) of PMMA–BAX composites shows appreciable decrease from 97 to 75%.
In the case of PMMA–BX composites, it remains
almost same (around 98%) with filler addition. The exact reason behind
this low densification on AgNP addition is not well understood, but
the high content of porosity obviously inhibits the composite to achieve
a high-thermal conductivity enhancement. In short, despite poor densification,
there is a substantial improvement in the TC of the PMMA nanocomposite
with hybrid filler compared to single filler system. For this reason,
we recommend hybrid filler-based nanocomposite as a suitable candidate
for thermal management applications. To qualify for packaging application,
apart from high-thermal conductivity, a deeper insight into its microstructural,
mechanical, and dielectric properties was required. Hence, a detailed investigation of these properties of PMMA–BAX nanocomposites was carried out in succeeding subsections.

2.3 SEM Analysis of the Hybrid Composites
Cross-sectional
SEM images of PMMA–BA35 are depicted in Figure 5a,b. At higher Vf (Figure 5a), the
fillers are in contact with each other, creating
an effective thermal conducting channel. Furthermore, the presence
of AgNP (Figure 5b)
represented by red dotted circles reveals that AgNPs spread all over
BNNS and facilitated connection between individual nanosheets. As
discussed earlier, AgNPs thereby serve as a thermal transport bridge
between individual BNNS and help to enhance the thermal conductivity
of the composite.

Figure 5 (a, b) Cross-sectional SEM images of PMMA–BA35.
The red
dotted circles in (b) show the bridging connections of silver among
BNNS.

To understand the elemental contribution
in nanocomposite and the
filler interactions with the host–polymer matrix, energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS)-coupled SEM analysis was carried out on PMMA–BA35. Figure 6a represents a typical
SEM image of PMMA–BA35, where the elemental mapping was carried
out. Figure 6b–d
shows uniform distribution of filler elements like B, Ag, and N, respectively,
in the polymer matrix. From Figure 6e, which is the quantitative elemental analysis, it
is clear that B and N are present almost at the same weight percent,
whereas the amount of AgNP came around 0.21 wt %. The low amount of
AgNPs in the micrograph suggests that it is unable to form a percolation
channel in the nanocomposite, and as a result, it will not significantly
influence the electrical conductivity of developed nanocomposite below
the percolation limits (Figure 7c).

dielectric loss (tan δ), and (c) alternating current
(ac) conductivity of PMMA–BAX nanocomposite
with respect to log frequency (inset: variation of ac conductivity
with filler content at 3 kHz).

2.4 Dielectric Properties of Nanocomposite
Besides high-thermal conductivity, the most desirable properties
of polymer nanocomposites are their low dielectric constant (εr) and appreciably low dielectric loss (tanδ) that qualify
them to be used as microelectronic substrates and encapsulation packages.56 The low-dielectric-constant materials are capable
of decreasing the relative capacitance delay, power consumption, and
cross-talk noise.57,58 Besides, the signal propagation
through a microelectronic substrate is inversely proportional to its
dielectric constant;58,57 therefore, low-dielectric-constant materials
are extensively preferred for high-performance substrate application.
In the present case, dielectric properties of PMMA–BAX nanocomposites were studied in both radiofrequencies and
microwave frequencies.

Figure 7a–c shows the variation in εr, tanδ, and ac conductivity of PMMA–BAX composite in the frequency range of 300 Hz to 3 MHz. Figure 7a shows a gradual
increase in εr with an increase
in filler content. At lower filler content, the increment is very
negligible, but as filler content increases to 0.35 Vf, there was a notable improvement in its εr. The main reason for increasing εr with
filler content was due to comparatively high εr of
hybrid filler (BNNS/AgNP) incorporated. This will lead to an enhancement
in the average electric field in the matrix, and when more filler
is added, more will be its effect.59 Second,
the addition of hybrid filler tends to improve the interfacial polarization
of the filler–matrix interface due to charge accumulation,
which thereby results in an enhancement of dielectric constant.59 However, the maximum εr obtained
for PMMA–BA35 comes below 5.6 in the entire frequency regime.
In general, the dielectric constant shows a gradual decrease with
frequency because at lower frequency all of the polarization mechanisms
are active and with an increase in frequency the effects of interfacial
and dipolar polarization are overpowered by ionic polarization, resulting
in a lowering of dielectric constant.60,61 At the same
time, compared to neat PMMA, the enhancement in εr after maximum filler addition (0.35 Vf) is around 34% (at 1 MHz). Interestingly, in comparison to TCE (363%)
of PMMA–BA35, the enhancement in εr is very
low. This result suggests that the AgNP effect is more in interconnecting
BNNS to form an effective thermal short-circuit path for heat dissipation. Similarly, tan δ
(Figure 7b) also shows
a decreasing trend with an increase in frequency. In the lower-frequency
region (up to 5 kHz), the difference is predominant, which increases
with filler content. This is mainly due to the influence of interfacial
polarization. When the frequency was increased above 5 kHz, the effect
is weakened, and even at higher frequencies, the tanδ value
of nanocomposite is almost similar to that of pristine PMMA. It takes
into account that the filler particle did not increase the dielectric
loss of developed nanocomposite considerably. Another crucial factor
which influences the practical utility of the developed composite
is the variation in ac conductivity of nanocomposite with filler content.
As depicted in Figure 7c, all nanocomposites have very low conductivity in the order of
10–7 S/cm. The result concludes that all of the
developed nanocomposites are highly electrically insulating and can
act as a suitable candidate for the microelectronic substrate as well
as package application. The inset of Figure 7c shows the variation of ac conductivity
with filler content at 3 kHz. The ac conductivity varies linearly
with filler content; however, the value falls below 10–10 S/cm. A higher level of accuracy in dielectric testing can be achieved
at microwave frequency ranges because the dielectric polarization
phenomenon is mainly dictated by ionic polarization in this regime.
Temperature-dependent dielectric constants were measured in the range
of 30–60 °C at 1 MHz, and the results are shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. As the graph
implies, for neat PMMA and at low filler loading, the variation of
dielectric constant is almost independent of temperature. On the other
hand, as the filler loading increases, the dielectric constant increase
slightly with temperature. This may be due to an increase in polarizability
of the nanocomposite with AgNP addition.62 The microwave dielectric properties of PMMA–BAX nanocomposites at 5 GHz are tabulated in Table 2.

Table 2 Microwave Dielectric

0.15	3.0	0.0146	
0.25	3.2	0.0163	
0.35	3.6	0.0173	
A similar trend was observed here also, that is, with
an increase
in filler content, both εr and tanδ increase
in a monotonic way. The maximum value of εr = 3.6
was obtained for PMMA–BA35 composite.

2.5 Thermogravimetric,
Mechanical, and Water Absorption
Studies of PMMA–BAX Nanocomposite
For electronic packaging applications, thermal stability and degradation
behavior of polymer nanocomposites as well as water absorption should
be critically evaluated. Thermal stability of the nanocomposite phase
was measured by thermogravimetric analysis, and the results are shown
in Figure 8a. From
the figure, it is observed that the thermal stability of nanocomposites
increases as a function of filler loading. The onset of thermal decomposition
of PMMA was shifted from 314 to 340 °C with the addition of 0.35 Vf of hybrid filler. This is because high-thermal-conductivity
AgNP/BNNS will endorse the formation of char, which will act as a
barrier for mass transport that decreases the decomposition rate.63 In addition, the restricted motion of polymer
chain by nanofiller will also promote the thermal stability of the
composite.64

Figure 8 (a) Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of PMMA–BAX with different
filler loadings and (b) water absorption as a function
of volume fraction of filler (inset: contact angle for PMMA–BA35).

Figure 8b shows
water absorption (%) of PMMA–BAX nanocomposites
as a function of filler content at room temperature. The results are
quite interesting to note because with an increase in filler content
the water absorption decreases gradually from 1.58 to 0.98% for PMMA–BA35.
Normally, the addition of ceramic filler tends to increase water absorption
due to the highly hydrophilic nature of ceramic particles. In the
present case, a reverse trend is observed, which is attributed to
the water-resistant nature of h-BN.7 The
inset of Figure 8b
shows the contact angle measurement of PMMA–BA35 at room temperature,
which is found to possess a contact angle of 85°. This result
substantiates the low water absorption of PMMA–BA35 discussed
before.

Vickers hardness values of neat PMMA, PMMA–BA15,
and PMMA–BA35
were measured by microindentation test, and the results are tabulated
in Table 3. Neat PMMA
has a hardness value of 178 MPa, which increases with filler addition.
This is obvious because the incorporation of hard ceramic particles
into polymer matrix will naturally improve its hardness value. However,
the enhancement is not very pronounced, which is believed to be due
to the low-hardness nature of BNNS compared to other ceramics. CTEs
of neat PMMA and PMMA–BA35 were measured in the temperature
range of 25–70 °C, and the results are given in Figure S2, Supporting Information. It was observed
from the figure that both samples show a linear expansion as a function
of temperature. The average CTE values of PMMA and PMMA–BA35
were around 87 and 77 ppm/°C, respectively.

3 Conclusions
BNNS decorated with AgNPs were prepared successfully through a
liquid exfoliation technique. HRTEM studies reveal the formation of
nanosheets and a uniform incorporation of AgNPs over BN. AFM analysis
shows that exfoliated sheets have a thickness of around 2.4 nm corresponding
to five to eight layers of BNNS. The novel approach to generate the
nanocomposite, using AgNP-dispersed BNNS as the filler, is found to
be effective in improving the thermal characteristics of PMMA. For
example, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of PMMA decreased
with the addition of BNNS decorated with AgNPs, and an apparent CTE
of 77 ppm/°C was observed for PMMA–BA35 nanocomposite.
Besides, a high-thermal conductivity of 1.48 W/m K was achieved for
PMMA–BA35, and it showed an impressive thermal conductivity
enhancement (TCE) of 363% compared to pristine PMMA. These results
were supplemented by elemental mapping and microstructural analysis
that showed a uniform distribution of filler in the matrix. The dielectric
properties of nanocomposites were studied in radiofrequencies and
microwave frequencies. Low εr and tanδ values
were achieved for all of the nanocomposites, indicating their suitability
in electronic packaging applications. Furthermore, the resistive nature
of the nanocomposite is retained despite silver decoration, which
is evident from its low value of ac conductivity (of the order of
10–7 S/cm). This indirectly suggests that AgNPs
did not from a percolation channel in the composite. The water absorption
behavior of nanocomposites decreases with filler content, and the
contact angle measurement indicates a value of 85° for PMMA–BA35,
revealing the low wettability of hybrid filler. Thermal stability
and hardness of composites were also increased with filler amount.
The nanocomposite, PMMA–BA35, has a hardness value of 189 MPa
compared to 178 MPa of pristine PMMA.

In brief, the results
reveal that the thermal conductivity of pristine
PMMA (0.32 W/m K) can be largely improved to 1.48 W/m K by the addition
of boron nitride nanosheets, where the latter were suitably decorated
with silver nanoparticles. The concentration of these silver nanoparticles
on BNNS can be very low enough to form conducting percolation channels.
At the same time, it facilitates connections between the exfoliated
BNNS, whereby the transfer of phonon mechanism gets intensified. In
this way, the PMMA–BAX nanocomposite is found
to be an attractive candidate for thermal management applications
in the electronic packaging industry.

4 Materials
and Methods
Hexagonal boron nitride powder of size ∼1
μm (98%,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), silver nitrate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; Nikunj Industries, Mumbai, India)
were used as the starting materials. All of the raw materials were
used as received without any further purification process.

4.1 Preparation of Hybrid Filler (BNNS/AgNP)
BNNS were
synthesized from bulk h-BN based on typical liquid-phase
exfoliation method using N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) as the exfoliation medium.65,34 In a typical exfoliation process, h-BN nanopowder
was dispersed in an excess amount of DMF solvent and effective exfoliation
was carried via sonication for 48 h in an ultrasonic bath. By this
continued sonication, h-BN was flaked off to form BNNS. After 48 h
sonication, silver nitrate solution (dissolved in DMF) was added slowly
to the exfoliated BNNS dispersion, with continuous sonication. The
whole mixture was kept overnight to effectuate uniform distribution
of AgNPs over exfoliated BNNS. Here, DMF plays a dual role as a solvent
for h-BN exfoliation as well as a reducing agent to convert silver
ion to metallic silver.34 In entire compositions,
the mass ratio of h-BN to silver nitrate was kept constant (1:1).
The volume fractions of h-BN and AgNP for each composite are tabulated
in the Supporting Information (Table S1)

4.2 Preparation of Nanocomposite (PMMA–BNNS/AgNP)
The nanocomposites were synthesized by an in situ method. For that,
PMMA dissolved in DMF was added very slowly to the above-prepared
hybrid filler dispersion with continuous sonication. To ensure homogenous
mixing of the filler and matrix, the sonication was further extended
for one more hour. Finally, the composite was precipitated out from
the DMF solvent by a rapid addition of distilled water. The resulting
precipitate was collected by filtration, washed several times with
distilled water to remove the nitrate ions if present, and dried overnight
in a hot air oven. A series of PMMA nanocomposites were developed
through this method by varying the hybrid filler loading from 0.05
to 0.35 volume fraction (Vf). Samples
for thermal, mechanical, and dielectric measurements were developed
by hot-pressing technique. For comparison of thermal conductivity,
nanocomposites without silver nanoparticles were also synthesized
via the same procedure. For the sake of simplicity, composites with
and without silver nanoparticles were mentioned as PMMA–BAX and PMMA–BX, respectively, where X denotes the volume percentage of filler. The schematic
representation of the entire process is shown in Figure 9.

of synthesis of PMMA–BAX nanocomposite.

4.3 Characterization
Phase purity and
presence of AgNP deposition over BNNS were analyzed by XRD (Cu Kα
radiation, PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer, the Netherlands).
The exfoliation of nanosheets and silver decoration were further analyzed
by HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2 30S-TWIN, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). The
thickness as well as the lateral dimension of the BNNS were examined
by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Bruker MultiMode, Santa Barbara,
CA). The thermal conductivity (TC) of the composites was measured
using a laser flash thermal property analyzer (Flash Line 2000, Anter
Corporation, Pittsburgh), which follows the relation 4  where α is
the thermal diffusivity,
ρ is the density, and Cp is the specific heat capacity
of the composite. The Cp values of all
of the composites were measured by keeping alumina (Al2O3) as the reference material. The density of the composites
was measured by the Archimedes method. Fractured microstructural analysis
and elemental mapping of composites were done using an EDS-coupled
scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO 18 Cryo SEM, Jena, Germany).
Water absorption tests of the composite were also done using the standard
ASTM protocol. For that, initially, the samples were dried at 70 °C
overnight and their weights (W1) was taken.
Subsequently, the samples were soaked in distilled water for 24 h,
and the final weight (W2) was measured
after wiping off the surface water. Then, percentage water absorption
was calculated using the equation 5  Contact angle measurements of the composite
were also carried out with the aid of automated goniometer/tensiometer
(model 290, Ramé-Hart Instrument Co.). Thermal stability of
the composites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (Shimadzu
TGA/DTA Instrument, Japan). Microhardness measurements of representative
samples were performed using Vickers microindentation hardness test
(Shimadzu HMV-2TAW, Kyoto, Japan). The coefficient of linear thermal
expansion (CTE) of representative samples was measured using a thermomechanical
analyzer (TMA/SS7300, SII NanoTechnology Inc.) in the temperature
range of 25–70 °C. The dielectric properties in the lower-frequency
regime (300 Hz to 3 MHz) and their variation with temperature (30–60
°C) were studied using an LCR meter (Hioki model, 3532-50, Nagano,
Japan). The microwave dielectric properties of the developed hybrid
composites were measured using a split post dielectric resonator (QWED,
Warsaw, Poland) operating at 5 GHz with an ENA series vector network
analyzer (E5071C, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
