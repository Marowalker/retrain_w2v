In
this study, we developed the universal encapsulation method
using poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) to improve
the water stability of perovskite solar cells. In order to enhance
the moisture barrier property, we utilized SiO2 and graphene
oxide (GO) fillers in the EVOH matrix. First, UV-treated SiO2 increased the dispersibility in the EVOH matrix and made the penetrating
path more complicated, which led to a better moisture barrier property.
The water vapor transmission ratio (WVTR) is enhanced from 4.72 ×
10–2 (EVOH only) to 1.55 × 10–2 (EVOH with SiO2 filler) g/m2 day. Second,
we found that GO reduce the unreacted hydroxyl groups that could attract
water molecules at the surface of EVOH. The addition of GO increased
the WVTR up to 3.34 × 10–3 g/m2 day.
Finally, our EVOH-based film successfully encapsulated without the
efficiency drop. The encapsulated devices surprisingly maintained
86% of their performance even under direct contact with water for
5 h.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells
(PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention
owing to their excellent photovoltaic properties, such as their high
optical absorption coefficients and carrier diffusion lengths.1−3 Since the first reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) value
of 3.8%, tremendous progress has been accomplished. Accordingly, the
PCE values reported in 2018 have reached 23.7%, which allows them
to serve as alternatives to Si solar cells.4,5 However,
halide perovskite materials have low moisture stability that limits
their potential industrial applications.6,7

One of
the most promising approaches used to solve the moisture
instability issue is the adoption of large cations into perovskite
structures that leads to the low dimensionality (2D or quasi-2D) of
perovskite materials. Zhang et al. reported that unsealed (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 retained 78.5%
of its original PCE for 160 h in an air atmosphere with 55 ±
5% humidity, while Yan et al. claimed that (BA)2(FA)2Pb3I10 retained 80% efficiency for 25
days in ambient air with 25 ± 5% humidity without any device
encapsulation.8,9 However, these materials cannot
endure adverse conditions, such as direct contact with water, which
occurs in rainy days. Therefore, the encapsulation is still essential
to guarantee the long-term stability of PSCs.

The use of polymer
films is a well-known strategy for device encapsulation
owing to their low-cost benefits, ease of process, and chemical stabilities.
Han and co-workers fabricated a device using a PMMA/reduced graphene
oxide composite as the encapsulant. It was stable for 1000 h at 35
°C and 40% humidity.10 Liu and co-workers
used poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) for encapsulation. It retained
its performances during a testing period of 3000 h in ambient air
with a humidity of ∼20%.11 However,
these polymers showed poor thermal, mechanical, and moisture barrier
properties and were considered inadequate for practical applications
and use in various devices. Recently, poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) has received worldwide attention as an alternative
because its good barrier properties can inhibit the permeation of
gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture. Specifically,
its outstanding barrier properties from oxygen render it applicable
to various industrial fields.12−15 The excellent barrier properties of EVOH are attributed
to the establishment of strong bonds between polymer chains due to
the hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups present in vinyl alcohol units.14−16 However, water also can be absorbed to hydroxyl groups owing to
their reactivity to water. When additional water molecules are absorbed
by EVOH, it will be plasticized, and its barrier properties will diminish.14 This is why EVOH is necessary to be modified
by methods such as the addition of fillers and multilayer structures.17−19 For instance, Liu and co-workers added SiO2 in EVOH to
improve its properties.20 They claimed
that SiO2 makes the permeation path of gases more tortuous
and leads to an improvement of its barrier properties. The addition
of 5 wt % SiO2 nanoparticles in EVOH reduced the permeation
of oxygen and water to 64.4 and 54.2%, respectively. Conversely, Li
and co-workers utilized boric acid and graphene oxide (GO) to form
hydrogen bonds with the unreactive hydroxyl groups of EVOH. Their
water vapor transmission ratio (WVTR) was reduced by 80.2% compared
to that for the pure film.21 Despite the
techniques reported in these studies, it is difficult to apply them
to PSCs using simple processes, such as spin-coating, because PSCs
are soluble in hydrophilic solvents, such as DMSO, DMF, and water,
which are common solvents for EVOH. Therefore, it is challenging to
achieve the encapsulation of PSCs using EVOH.

In this study,
we apply EVOH as the encapsulant of PSCs to improve
their water stabilities. Dispersibility changed SiO2, and
GO fillers were added to increase the barrier properties of EVOH.
The properties and performance of our EVOH compositions were characterized
using SEM, zeta potential, surface contact angle, and WVTR. We successfully
incorporated our EVOH compositions onto the PSCs that led to their
good stability even under the direct contact of water.

Results and Discussion
Effects
of Incorporating UV-Treated SiO2
To investigate
the effects of SiO2 on the quality of the
EVOH film, samples (EVOH/S5:EVOH film with nontreated SiO2, EVOH/S5/UV:EVOH film with UV-treated SiO2) were prepared
using the method described in the Experimental Section. It is worth noting that 5 wt % SiO2 in EVOH is the optimized
condition for obtaining the best moisture barrier property as shown
in Figure S1. Figure 1a,b shows the surface morphology of EVOH/S5
and EVOH/S5/UV. As shown in Figure 1a, SiO2 nanoparticles in EVOH/S5 were aggregated
(red circles) that may lead to poor moisture barrier properties owing
to the excessive presence of a nonblocked moisture permeation path.
Conversely, SiO2 nanoparticles in EVOH/S5/UV were well
dispersed in the form of relatively small particles as described in Figure 1b. SiO2 was confirmed by EDS for EVOH/S5 (Figure 1c) and EVOH/S5/UV (Figure 1d). The uniformly dispersed SiO2 fillers in EVOH/S5/UV help form a more complicated penetration path
of moisture, which improves their moisture barrier properties. This
result was attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles
into the EVOH matrix caused by the reduction of organic compounds.
UV treatment cleans the surface of SiO2 and reduces the
aggregation of particles.22−24Figure 1e shows a schematic of the effect owing to
the UV treatment. Contaminants, such as organic compounds, are being
absorbed on the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles, which induces
aggregation of particles and adversely affects the homogeneous dispersion
of SiO2 nanoparticles in the EVOH matrix.25 UV treatment allows them to be dispersed uniformly by removing
organic compounds that may help improve their barrier properties.
To verify the improved dispersibility of the UV-treated SiO2, a zeta potential analysis was conducted for EVOH/S5 and EVOH/S5/UV.
Accordingly, a potential of −88.12 mV was obtained for the
EVOH/S5/UV solution, which had more negative charges on the surface
compared to the evoked potential of −70.21 mV for the EVOH/S5
solution, as shown in Figure S2. This means
that SiO2 in EVOH/S5/UV is well dispersed as a stable colloid
in the solvent compared to EVOH/S5.26,27 Furthermore,
the improved optical properties for EVOH/S5/UV also dictate the homogeneous
dispersion of SiO2 compared to EVOH/S5 films (see Figure S3).

The Ca cell was fabricated to
evaluate the barrier properties of
EVOH according to the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles, as
shown in Figure 2a.
The Ca test was carried out at 25 °C/85%, and the conductance
was calculated by the time Ca was fully oxidized. Calculation of the
WVTR was performed using the following equation that was originally
proposed by Paetzold et al.28  where the factor “2”
is the
molar equivalent of the Ca corrosion reaction, MH2O (18 g/mol) and MCa (40.1 g/mol) are the molecular weights of water and Ca, respectively,
ρCa (1.55 g/cm3) is the density of Ca,
σ (3.4 × 10–8 Ω m) is the resistivity
of Ca, d(G)/d(t) is the rate of
change of conductance (G), ACa is the area of deposited Ca, and A is the
barrier film area on Ca.

Figure 2 (a) Fabrication process of the Ca detector encapsulated
with EVOH.
(b) Normalized conductance of EVOH after the incorporation of the
SiO2 fillers.

As shown in Figure S4, the conductance
decreases consistently in a linear manner in the interval known as
the lag region during a time interval described as the lag time interval
or alternatively known as the breakthrough time.29,30 The WVTR was calculated by substituting the slope during the lag
region in the above equation.28,31 The conductance changes
of the Ca test by the addition of fillers and its calculated WVTR
are shown in Figure 2b and Table 1, respectively.
According to the results of the WVTR, it is obvious that the incorporation
of SiO2 into the EVOH yields better moisture barrier properties,
thereby improving the WVTR from 4.72 × 10–3 to 1.55 × 10–3 g/m2 day and increasing
the lag time from 0.74 to 4.40 h. The WVTR result was also confirmed
by MOCON test, which shows a similar result (4.66 × 10–3 g/m2 day) on the EVOH sample, which means our WVTR calculation
is reliable to use (see Figure S5). It
should be noted that the barrier properties of EVOH/S5/UV were enhanced
compared to the results of EVOH/S5.

EVOH/S5	2.87 × 10–2	2.21	
EVOH/S5/UV	1.55 × 10–2	4.40	
This finding is expected given our SEM and zeta potential
results
in the previous section. Therefore, increased dispersibility of SiO2 in the EVOH matrix by the UV treatment made the penetration
path more complicated, which led to better moisture barrier properties.32−34

Effects of Incorporating Graphene Oxide
Although we
successfully demonstrated UV-treated SiO2 as a moisture
barrier in EVOH, the encapsulation property could be enhanced by passivating
the hydroxyl groups of EVOH. GO was added into the EVOH solution to
increase the hydrogen bonding with the unreacted hydroxyl groups of
EVOH.28,35 When 1 wt % GO (G1) was added, the highest
barrier properties were evoked, and a tendency was observed whereby
the barrier properties diminished as the concentration of GO increased
(see Figure S6 and Table S1). This is why
the addition of GO decreases the crystallinity of EVOH that in turn
adversely affects its barrier properties.21,34 Therefore, it is expected that the barrier properties could be maximized
by the addition of 1% GO into our EVOH/S5/UV sample, as discussed
in the previous section. The images of the Ca test for each sample
are shown in Figure 3a. As water penetrated, Ca was gradually oxidized and changed to
transparent, thereby resulting in a decreased conductance.28,31

Oxidation of Ca samples encapsulated with composite films as
a function of time. (b) Normalized conductance of EVOH after the incorporation

films.

As shown in Figure 3b and Table 2, the
WVTR of EVOH/S5/UV/G1 surprisingly increased by more than 10 times
compared to EVOH. The conductivity reached 3.34 × 10–3, and the lag time was 6.92 h. The results of the EVOH/G1 sample
also showed a similar trend with EVOH/S5/UV/G1. These results indicate
that the increase of hydrogen bonding among the unreacted hydroxyl
groups and GO lead to better barrier properties owing to the reduction
of the reactive sites for water.35,36 To evaluate
the property of the film surface, contact angle analyses were performed,
as shown in Figure 3c.

EVOH/G1	3.66 × 10–3	6.65	
EVOH/S5/UV/G1	3.34 × 10–3	6.92	
Although the use of SiO2 made the
film surface hydrophilic
owing to the hydrophilic surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles,
the addition of GO increased the hydrophobicity owing to the decreased
unreacted hydroxyl groups of EVOH, as discussed before.34−38 It should be noted that the addition of SiO2 in EVOH
is beneficial for the enhancement of its moisture barrier properties
because the merit of the moisture blocking property of SiO2 overweighs the drawbacks of the increased hydrophilicity, as shown
by the results in Figure 2b. When both fillers were added, the hydrophobicity reduced
by the addition of S5/UV was slightly increased similar to that of
neat EVOH.

Stability Test with PSCs
To examine
the stability of
the encapsulated PSCs, a reservoir test (direct contact with water
on the encapsulated surface) was performed. It is a harsh condition
because the halide perovskite materials are immediately degraded when
it is in contact with water.39 As shown
in Figure 4a, we successfully
developed the simple encapsulation process for the utilization of
our EVOH-based film on PSCs that consisted of the following steps:
(i) fabrication of PSCs on the glass substrate, (ii) placement of
prepared EVOH-based films on top of PSCs, and (iii) sealing of the
outer parts of PSCs using the adhesive followed by a UV curing process
(see Experimental Section). It should be noted
that the conventional spin-coating method for the deposition of EVOH
is not applicable owing to the use of a polar solvent that can dissolve
the perovskite. The encapsulation process does not damage the PSCs,
as assessed by their power conversion efficiencies of 17.86% (before)
and 17.28% (after), as shown in Figure 4b. The distribution of efficiency for our PSCs in this
study is shown in Figure S7. The reservoir
test had already been performed by the time the cell was breaking.
To maintain the temperature, the samples were maintained on the hot
plate at 25 °C. Figure 4c shows the evaluation results of PSCs with and without encapsulation.
PSCs without encapsulation were rapidly decomposed as soon as water
was dropped, which resulted in the destruction of the PSCs. In the
case of the PSCs with encapsulation, water penetration was successfully
blocked. Approximately 86 and 61% of the PCEs were still retained
compared to their initial values after 5 and 10 h from the onset of
the reservoir test, respectively. It is worth noting that the results
exhibited by the encapsulated PSCs, which retained their efficiency
of 86% of their initial performance for 5 h, were much better than
those where the efficiency was maintained at 95% of their initial
performance for 60 s, as reported by Idígoras et al.40 This indicates the potential as the encapsulant
of EVOH/S5/UV/G1 to protect the perovskite device requiring excellent
barrier properties to moisture.

test of PSCs encapsulated with EVOH/S5/UV/G1.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated the encapsulation
of PSCs using EVOH with
SiO2 and GO fillers. We found that UV-treated SiO2 increases the dispersibility in the precursor solution and the film
of EVOH, which is caused by removing organic compounds on the surface
of SiO2. The well-dispersed SiO2 in the EVOH
matrix made the moisture-penetrating path more complicated, which
leads to an enhanced WVTR result of 1.55 × 10–2 g/m2 day compared to the result without SiO2. We further improved the moisture barrier property up to 3.34 ×
10–3 g/m2 day of WVTR by the addition
of GO in the EVOH matrix. It was found that GO decreases the unreacted
hydroxyl groups in the EVOH matrix that reduces the attraction of
water molecules. It is confirmed by the surface contact angle measurements
of both EVOH/G1 and EVOH/S5/UV/G1 samples. Using the optimized EVOH
film with fillers, perovskite solar cells were successfully encapsulated.
The encapsulant process utilized the UV curing adhesive to attach
our EVOH film on the device, and it did not show any damage to the
performance of PSCs. To examine the moisture stability of encapsulated
PSCs, we made the reservoir that is in direct contact with water on
our encapsulated device. Surprisingly, the performance of our device
retained 86% of the initial performance even after 5 h in the reservoir
test, which is the harsh condition for PSCs. The unencapsulated device
was immediately degraded after contacting with water. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report that applies EVOH as the
encapsulant on PSCs. We consider that it has the potential to pave
the way toward a universal encapsulation method.

Experimental Section
EVOH Precursor
Fabrication
The EVOH precursor solution
was prepared to synthesize the thin films with spin-coating. EVOH
(32% ethylene), SiO2 (5–20 nm particle size), GO
(sheets), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Ltd. Specifically, EVOH (1.5 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of DMSO at
100 °C for 2 h with stirring. For the synthesis of EVOH/S5 samples,
5 wt % SiO2 was dispersed in 10 mL of DMSO with stirring
for 2 h and was subsequently sonicated for 2 h. Other concentrations
of SiO2 samples were prepared in the same method. Subsequently,
EVOH (1.5 g) was added into the prepared SiO2 solution.
In the case of the EVOH/S5/UV sample, the same procedure was used
as that used for EVOH/S5 with the exception that the UV treatment
of SiO2 lasted for 2 h with the use of a UV/ozone cleaner
(ProCleaner, BIOFORCE) before usage. GO was prepared with the same
method as that used for EVOH/S5 at the concentrations of 1 (G1), 3
(G3), and 5 wt % (G5). The mixed solution of UV-treated SiO2 and GO (EVOH/S5/UV/G1) was prepared by dispersing the GO first in
DMSO followed by the execution of the same procedure used for EVOH/S5/UV.
All solutions were prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and were
cooled to room temperature.

Ca Detector Test
The 200 nm Al electrode
was deposited
on a glass substrate (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) using a thermal evaporator.
After the Al deposition, the 300 nm Ca electrode was deposited onto
the glass via an evaporator. The EVOH precursor solution was spin-coated
at 2000 rpm for 30 s onto the Ca cell. The deposited substrates were
heated at 70 °C for 1 h. These processes were carried out three
times after the precursor solution was cooled to room temperature
for 30 min. The thickness of the thin films was ∼100 μm.
To evaluate the WVTR, the Ca detector coating EVOH was exposed at
25 °C at an 85% relative humidity (RH) (PR–1J, ESPEC,
Japan). The resistance changes of the Ca detector were measured with
the use of a data acquisition system (DAQ, 2680A, FLUKE).

Perovskite
Solar Cell Fabrication
Materials
For the perovskite absorber
material, 15
g formamidine acetate and 30 mL of HI (57 wt % in water) were dissolved
in 100 mL of ethanol at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring to obtain
HC(NH2)2I. The HC(NH2)2I solution was dried using a rotary evaporator at 50 °C for
1 h. Following recrystallization from ethanol, white crystals were
washed with diethyl ether. To synthesize CH3NH3Br, 11 mL of methylamine (33 wt % in water) and 10 mL of HBr (48
wt % in water) were mixed in 100 mL of ethanol at 0 °C for 2
h with stirring. The prepared HC(NH2)2I (or
CH3NH3Br) and PbI2 (or PbBr2) solutions were dissolved at room temperature in a dimethylformamide
(DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (1:0.25 (v/v)) to obtain
a 1.2 M HC(NH2)2PbI3 (or CH3NH3Br3) solution. To prepare the absorption
layer precursor solution, HC(NH2)2PbI3 and CH3NH3Br3 solutions were mixed
with the specific volume ratio for (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.85/(CH3NH3PbBr3)0.15. Additionally, extra PbI2 (5 mol
% to HC(NH2)2PbI3) was then dissolved
in the synthesized (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.85(CH3NH3PbBr3)0.15 solution by heating it at 60 °C for 30 min. The materials used
in this work were purchased from Alfa Aesar, Lumtec, or Sigma-Aldrich
and were not purified.

Cell Fabrication
To fabricate mesoporous
solar cells
for the experimental work, a compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was deposited by spray pyrolysis (∼50 nm) using 20
mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 450 °C
on the clean FTO glass (TEC8). After the deposition of the c-TiO2
layer, 150 mg/mL mesoporous TiO2 paste (m-TiO2, Dyesol 30 NR-D) in ethanol was spin-coated at 5000 rpm (acceleration
of 2000 rpm/s) for 10 s. The deposited substrates were heated at 100
°C for 10 min followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min.
The prepared perovskite solution was spun at 2000 rpm (acceleration
of 200 rpm/s) and 6000 rpm (acceleration of 2000 rpm/s) for 10 and
30 s, respectively. The antisolvent chlorobenzene was drop-casted
(110 mL) during the last 20 s of the second spin-coating step. The
coated perovskite film was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for
20 min. For the deposition of the hole transport layer, a solution
containing 41.6 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 7.5 μL of a 500 mg/mL lithium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile, and
16.9 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 0.5 mL of chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the perovskite/m-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 2000 rpm (acceleration
of 1200 rpm). All films on m-TiO2 were prepared in a nitrogen-filled
glove box. Finally, 100 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation.

Stability Test
The EVOH precursor solution without
or with fillers was poured into the Si mold and was heated at 70 °C
on the hot plate overnight. The residue solvents of the fabricated
film were removed using a vacuum pump. The EVOH film was then attached
to the top of the PSCs using the Norland optical adhesive (NOA, NOA
63, Norland). It was cured with UV light for 60 s. Water was dropped
onto the encapsulated PSCs, and it was placed on the hot plate at
25 °C by the time the PSCs were breaking.

Characterization
The morphology of the EVOH films was
measured with the use of a field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL Ltd.). The dispersion of the fillers was measured
using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Quanta 3D FEG, FEI)
and a zeta potential analyzer (ELS-1000ZS, Otsuka Electronics Ltd.).
The water contact angle was measured using the dynamic contact angle
equipment (DCA, Phoenix 300, SEO). The analysis of transmittance was
performed with the use of the UV–vis spectrophotometer (V-570,
JASCO). The current density–voltage measurements were measured
with a solar cell testing system (LAB 200, McScience, Korea), which
used simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G) with an intensity of 100 mW
cm–2. Light was generated with a K3000 model (McScience)
and was recorded using an ADCMT 6244 source measurement unit. After
masking them with a 0.02 cm2 aperture, the solar cells
were measured at a scan rate of 1.2 V/s. All the results were obtained
under ambient conditions. The illumination intensity was calibrated
using a standard Si reference cell (K801S-K067, McScience, Korea).
