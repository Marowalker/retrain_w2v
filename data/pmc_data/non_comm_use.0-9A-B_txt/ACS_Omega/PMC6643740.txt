Aggregation-induced
emission has provided fluorescence enhancement
strategies for metal nanoclusters. However, the morphology of the
aggregated nanoclusters tended to be irregular due to the random aggregated
route, which would result in the formation of an unstable product.
Herein, copper nanoclusters were directly synthesized by using l-cysteine as both the reducing and protection ligand. Initially,
the structure of the product was irregular. Furthermore, Ce3+ was introduced to re-arrange the aggregates through a crosslinking
avenue. It was interesting to find that well-ordered three-dimensional
nanomaterials with mesoporous sphere structures were obtained after
re-aggregation. On the basis of the stability test at a relatively
high temperature and the light-emitting diode fabrication investigation,
it revealed that the regulated product demonstrated more promising
stability and color purity for practical applications than the random
aggregated product with irregular structures.

Introduction
Noble metal nanoclusters
(NCs) have attracted great attention for
optical applications due to the lower toxic effect compared to organic
dyes or quantum dots.1−3 Among the NCs, copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are the
most cost-effective.4 However, their optical
applications are limited, since most products tend to describe weak
brightness and poor stability.5,6 Aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) has been proved to improve the fluorescence behavior
of the NCs efficiently.7 The dispersed
NCs were aggregated as normal size materials by means of electrostatic
interactions, noncovalent interactions, solvophobic interactions,
or van der Waals interactions.8−11 Normally, irregular structures and unstable properties
were demonstrated for aggregated products.12 The fluorescence brightness of such products was still required
to be improved, since the irregular aggregates could be easily collapsed,
not to mention that the structures were probably not repeatable to
synthesize.

Recently, it was fortunate that the construction
of aggregated
NCs as regular structures was performed by following several types
of assembling protocols. For instance, Zn2+ could not only
effectively induce dispersed gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) as aggregates,
but also mediate these aggregates to ordered one-dimensional (1D)
nanomaterials, which significantly sensitized the fluorescence of
AuNCs in the dispersed form.13 Another
strategy facilitated the dipolar attraction between CuNCs to induce
the aggregates as two-dimensional (2D) nanowires by the van der Waals
attraction with the 1-dodecanethiol protection ligands.14 Then, the CuNCs were rearranged within the nanowires
to produce 2D nanoribbons. By the employment of similar protocols,
the same group also successfully induced silver nanoclusters (AgNCs)
and Au(I)-doped CuNCs as ordered 2D nanomaterials.15,16 In addition, the addition of ethanol led to the aggregation of CuNCs
as 2D nanosheets, attributed to the formation of metal defect-rich
surface.17 These ordered nanomaterials
demonstrated more excellent application activity in the field of catalysis
and illumination than both the NCs in dispersed and random aggregated
form, which indicated that the shape and structure played an important
role in practical application. Significant progress has been achieved
for the fabrication of aggregated NCs as regular 1D and 2D nanomaterials
with appropriate morphology. It should be noticed that three-dimensional
(3D) nanomaterials also demonstrated excellent performance for applications.18 For instance, the 3D nanoflowers prepared by
enzyme and copper(II) phosphate described enhanced catalytic activity,
stability, and durability.19 More excellent
surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy performance was achieved for hybrid
nanostructured materials that contained branched gold nanoparticles
and radial SiO2 shells.20 However,
few works reported the effective strategy for assembling NCs as ordered
nanomaterials with controllable 3D morphology.21 This may be attributed to the unfavorable fuse of nanosized
clusters after their seamless connection.

The fluorescence brightness
could be significantly enhanced by
AIE due to the inhibition of the intramolecular vibrations and rotations
in NCs.22,23 Notwithstanding, when the aggregates were
so compact that much bigger size particles were fused, the fluorescence
would also be quenched to a certain extent. Consequently, exploring
a protocol for aggregating NCs as appropriate structures is of great
importance. Herein, we found a method for assembling CuNCs into well-ordered
mesoporous spheres by the binding ability of metal ions with l-cysteine-protected nanomaterials.24 The
structures of the aggregates could be adjusted to a controllable form
by tuning the amounts of Ce3+. The mechanism is described
in Scheme 1. Initially,
the aggregates of l-cysteine-protected CuNCs were obtained
with irregular structures (A-CuNCs-1), which could be stable in weak
acid medium like glutathione (GSH)-protected CuNCs.25 Next, Na2CO3 was introduced to tune
the solvent of the sample as weak base medium so that the aggregates
would be dispersed by the hydrolyzed OH–. Furthermore,
the addition of Ce3+ immediately neutralized the medium
due to the formation of Ce(OH)3. After that, the weak-emissive
CuNCs in dispersed form were obtained. Furthermore, they could be
rearranged and assembled as the new aggregates (A-CuNCs-2) by means
of the crosslinking connection between l-cysteine and the
additional Ce3+. To identify the performance, light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) were fabricated by the powders of aggregated CuNCs based
on A-CuNCs-1 and A-CuNCs-2. It revealed that the as obtained mesoporous
spheres (A-CuNCs-2) demonstrated much more promising performance than
the irregular aggregates (A-CuNCs-1) as applied for illumination materials.

CuNCs as Mesoporous Spheres for the Fabrication of LED Devices with
and without the Assistance of Ce3+
Results and Discussions
It has been found that l-cysteine could be used as both
the reducing and protection ligand for the synthesis of CuNCs.12 Meanwhile, the as aggregated products (A-CuNCs-1)
were highly fluorescent due to the AIE effect. However, the morphology
was pretty irregular because the discrete CuNCs randomly interacted
with each other through a quite fast route, which would bring concern
about the stability of the product. Since different metal ions had
different aggregating effects, it was worth wondering whether they
were capable of transforming the irregular aggregates into regular
nanomaterials here.26,27 A-CuNCs-1 were stable in acid
media at room temperature, but they would be completely decomposed
after the introduction of strong alkaline such as NaOH. This was similar
to the acid-stable and base-soluble behaviors of GSH and dipicolinic
acid protected CuNCs.28,29 Although NaOH could be used to
dissolve A-CuNCs-1, the increase of NaOH in the colloid also significantly
enhanced the pH value after the titration jump point, where the NCs
would be completely broken down.12 Herein,
a relatively weak alkaline Na2CO3 was used to
disperse the aggregates gently so that the generation of OH– was released by a hydrolysis route. Then, it would be difficult
for CuNCs to be dramatically decomposed. After that, various types
of metal ions including K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Ce3+, Al3+, Zn2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Ag+, and Au3+ were introduced
to induce the rearrangement of the aggregates based on the corresponding
binding effect. Firstly, the fluorescence emission spectra were used
to monitor the change in the product, see Figure 1. The picture for the fluorescence response
is described in Figure S1. It could be
observed from Figure 1a,b that the fluorescence of the dispersed CuNCs in the absence of
metal ions was quite weak. Additionally, no significant change was
observed in the presence of K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, which indicated that
these metal ions could hardly induce re-aggregation of CuNCs. Correspondingly,
almost no fluorescence change of the colloid was found in the picture,
because all these fluorescence signals were too weak to be monitored
with the current excitation at 365 nm under a UV lamp, see Figure S1b. However, the fluorescence of the
discrete CuNCs could be sensitized with a relatively low concentration
(100 μM) of Pb2+, Ce3+, and Al3+. Meanwhile, according to Figure S1d,
all other metal ions including Ce3+, Al3+, Zn2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Au3+ were capable of enhancing the fluorescence
of the dispersed CuNCs at high concentrations except for Ag+. It could also be observed from Figure 1c,d that Pb2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Ag+, and Au3+ slightly enhanced
the fluorescence, while Ce3+, Al3+, Zn2+, Sn2+, and Cu2+ significantly enhanced the
fluorescence at high concentrations. According to these phenomena,
it could be concluded that the enhancement effect was influenced by
the species and concentration of metal ions. The details of the enhancement
behavior on the dispersed CuNCs were demonstrated by the fluorescence
emission spectra as the titration of each metal ion as shown in Figures S2–S10.

Figure 1 (a) Fluorescence emission
spectra for the aggregated CuNCs induced
by various metal ions (K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and Fe2+) and (b) the corresponding
fluorescence intensity at 615 nm. (c) Fluorescence emission spectra
for the aggregated CuNCs induced by various metal ions (none, Ce3+, Al3+, Zn2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Ag+, and Au3+) and (d) the corresponding fluorescence intensity at 615
nm. Note: the maximum enhancement for the fluorescence emission spectra
of each metal ion is described here.

It could be seen from Figure 1b that K+, Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+ had little enhancement effect for the dispersed
CuNCs. Apparently, there was something in common that insoluble hydroxides
were not formed easily with extremely low concentration of these metal
ions. Thus, it was difficult for them to significantly change the
pH values of the colloid by neutralizing OH–. On
the other hand, it could be seen that all these metal ions with trace
values that enabled the formation of insoluble hydroxides could enhance
the fluorescence. This indicated that the binding constant (Ksp) between −OH and these metal ions
for the formation of the insoluble metal hydroxides would probably
be important for the AIE effect. To confirm whether there is some
relationship between Ksp and the fluorescence
enhancement, the Ksp values of all the
investigated metal ions are listed in Table 1. The corresponding fluorescence enhancement
factor of each metal ion was analyzed based on the maximum emission
intensity change at 615 nm as shown in Figures S2–S10. It could be observed that no significant enhancement
was found when Ksp > 1.0 × 10–15. When Ksp < 7.1 ×
10–18, all the metal ions significantly enhanced
the fluorescence of aggregated CuNCs, except for Cu2+,
Fe3+, and Au3+. This partly confirmed our assumption
that the metal ions with an extremely low Ksp were capable of enhancing the fluorescence effectively. On the other
hand, it revealed that there was some unexpected tendency of AIE in
the case of the heavy metal ions and noble metal ions. Then, other
factors should be considered besides Ksp. It was reported that Fe3+ and Pb2+ had a
quenching effect for most NCs.30,31 Herein, for these heavy
metal ions, both the enhancement and quenching effects would influence
the fluorescence behavior. Taken together, the enhancement would rely
on the competitions between the quenching and the AIE effect. This
was the reason that Pb2+ preferentially sensitized fluorescence
for dispersed CuNCs at low concentrations, but it did not show advantages
over other metal ions at high concentrations when quenching behavior
played a more important role. Meanwhile, for the noble metal ions
such as Au3+, Ag+, and Cu2+, the
AIE effect was not the only factor that would influence the fluorescence
behavior. We found that l-cysteine could be used as a protection
ligand for the formation of AuNCs and AgNCs with relatively weak fluorescence
compared to l-cysteine-protected CuNCs. The fluorescence
behavior of l-cysteine-protected AuNCs and AgNCs is described
in Figure S11. It could be seen that the
maximum fluorescence emission would not be obtained until ca. 415
nm was used as the excitation wavelength for AgNCs, which was far
from 365 nm. Therefore, it made it difficult to show the illumination
under a UV lamp (Figure S1d) for Ag+-induced aggregates. The noble metal ions such as Cu2+, Ag+, and Au3+ would not only participate
in the sensitization of fluorescence for dispersed CuNCs based on
AIE, but would also participate in the formation of new NCs. As a
result, both negative and positive effects would be demonstrated for
the fluorescence enhancement. In summary, all the final enhancement
factor would depend on the competition between the two effects.

Except for
the negative influence of heavy and noble metal ions,
the enhancement factor did not increase with the decrease in Ksp, although all the metal ions with low Ksp were capable of enhancing the fluorescence
due to the neutralization of OH–. After that, the
AIE could be reinforced either by crosslinking or by the −OH-metal
core binding effect.27,32,33 However, more complicated factors that contributed to the fluorescence
behavior should be considered. Figure 1 indicates that Ce3+ demonstrated the most
significant enhancing ability to the fluorescence of CuNCs in comparison
with other ions. For investigation of the priority, the morphologies
of the metal ion-induced aggregates were investigated by scanning
electron microscope (SEM) and are described in Figure 2. It could be seen that the different metal
ions would induce the formation of aggregates with different structures.
The sphere shapes were described by the aggregated product induced
by Ce3+, a low concentration of Cu2+ (100 μM),
Zn2+, and Sn2+, and a high concentration of
Cu2+ and Al3+, see Figure 2c,d,j,k,m,p. All these products tended to
demonstrate regular shapes. However, it could be seen from Figure 2c that the product
for Ce3+-induced aggregates were not only regular but also
mesoporous. These types of aggregates would exhibit large surface
area as well as stability. The detailed comparison for the morphology
in higher magnification is described in Figure S12 and for the spheres in Figure 2d,c,m. It could be clearly reveled that the
fluorescence of these aggregates for Cu2+-induced products
in Figures S12A1–A3 and B1–B3 would probably be inhibited since the large area of the surface
could not be exposed effectively due to the extremely tight structure.
On the other hand, the morphology for Ce3+-induced aggregates
in Figure S12C1–C3 was mesoporous,
which tended to describe more promising properties.

products were demonstrated with the highest fluorescence enhancement
induced by the metal ions.

To more deeply understand how Ce3+ influences
the structure
of the aggregated product, various amounts of Ce3+ have
been employed to induce the rearrangement of the aggregates. Firstly,
the fluorescence behavior was investigated using copper precursors
with different amounts and is described in Figure 3. It could be seen from Figure 3 that a significant fluorescence
enhancement trend as the function of the amounts of Ce3+ was demonstrated. The fluorescence quantum yields for CuNCs with
the brightest fluorescence before and after Ce3+ rearrangement
was measured to be 3.4 and 8.3% using acridine yellow (47% in ethanol)
as a reference. Additionally, the relationship between the AIE effect
and the amounts of Na2CO3 was analyzed, see Figure S13. It could be observed that more amounts
of Ce3+ would be required for the sensitization of fluorescence
enhancement when more amounts of Na2CO3 was
employed. When Na2CO3 was less than 120 μL,
the original A-CuNCs-1 was not completely dispersed. Then, the AIE
effect could not be optimized due to the presence of irregular aggregates.
However, when more than 120 μL of Na2CO3 was employed, the medium for the colloid would be tuned as a weak
base state, which could not allow further aggregation without additional
assistance. Thus, the initially added Ce3+ had to be neutralizing
with the hydrolysis OH– from Na2CO3 so as to change the pH to a neutral value. After that, the
dispersed CuNCs would be re-aggregated through the combination of
additional Ce3+. Notwithstanding, the formation of too
much non-fluorescent Ce(OH)3 would probably inhibit the
fluorescence for the re-aggregated A-CuNCs-2 when high concentrations
of OH– were present. Then, both insufficient and
residual Na2CO3 were not favored for realizing
the optimum enhancement. It could be seen from Figure S13b that the AIE efficiency reached the optimum value
by using 120 μL of Na2CO3, which just
completely dispersed the aggregates of A-CuNCs-1. In this case, almost
no Ce3+ was required to neutralize OH–. Thus, it would completely participate in the crosslinking formation
of the new aggregates. Besides, it was proposed that the coordination
between Ce3+ and l-cysteine on the surface of
CuNCs led to the aggregation of CuNCs through a crosslinking route,
since other nanomaterials could be crosslinked with the assistance
of l-cysteine via hydrogen bonding or zwitterionic Interaction.34 Herein, the introduction of Ce3+ would
accelerate binding via forming −CuNCs–COO–Ce3+–NH2–CuNCs–, the mechanism
of which was similar to the literature.32,34,35 The detail crosslinking route is described in Figure S14. It could be expected that the formation
of aggregates based on the coordination bonds would more significantly
limit the vibration and rotation of CuNCs than the random aggregates.

the presence of various amounts of Cu2+ (0.1 M) (Cys, 0

150 μL; Cu5, 200 μL). (b) The corresponding aggregated
CuNCs regulated by Ce3+ with the most significant enhancement
(c) and the fluorescence intensity comparison for CuNCs induced by
the absence and presence of Ce3+.

Self-assembly of CuNCs driven by different amounts of Ce3+ was explored by the SEM technique and is demonstrated in Figure 4. The directly aggregated
CuNCs are described in Figure 4a. No regular shapes were displayed in the absence of Ce3+. Meanwhile, based on our experiments, these aggregates for l-cysteine-protected CuNCs had not always exhibited the same
shape. It was not surprising that the aggregates for l-cysteine-protected
CuNCs in previous paper was also irregular, but it was not the same
as that described in Figure 4a, either.12 Notwithstanding, after
the introduction of Ce3+, aggregated CuNCs tended to display
more regular mesoporous spherical morphology, see Figure 4b–e. The corresponding
size distribution and dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization
are described in Figures S15 and S16. Both
the SEM and DLS characterization demonstrated that the sample could
be controlled with the well size distribution, when 100 μM of
Ce3+ was employed (Figure 4e). On the basis of the enlargement of the morphology
(Figure 4e1), it could
be clearly demonstrated that the mesoporous spheres were constructed
with multilevel structures containing the assembled nanosheets. This
type of morphology would be promising for applications as illumination
materials according to previous paper.15 To compare the modified aggregates with regular morphology and the
aggregates with random structures, more characterization was investigated
as follows.

(b) 10 μM; (c) 25 μM; (d) 50 μM; (e) 100 μM;
(e1) enlargement of (e).

Firstly, the optical behaviors were studied and are described
in Figure 5. It could
be seen
that the absorbance spectrum of A-CuNCs-1 did not show obvious absorption
peak at ca. 560 nm that could indicate the formation of big particles.
This followed the phenomena of previous work that the ultra-small
size CuNCs could not support the surface plasmon resonance effect.36 From Figure 5a, it could also be seen that the absorbance for A-CuNCs-2
from 400 to 600 nm was more significant than that for A-CuNCs-1.

light (a) and UV illumination (d).

On the basis of these phenomena, it is worth wondering whether
the enhancement of the fluorescence was caused by the enhanced yield
of CuNCs. Then, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
was employed to analyze the concentration of total Cu as well as Ce
in the product. The results are described in Table 2. Similar to the typical synthesis of A-CuNCs-1,
100 μL of 0.1 M Cu (NO3)2 was used as
the precursor for the fabrication of A-CuNCs-2. Then, various concentration
of Ce3+ was employed to induce AIE. After the digestion
of the samples by HNO3 acid, the concentration of Cu2+ and Ce3+ were investigated for indicating the
yield for the generation of CuNCs. The amounts of CuNCs would be in
a linear relationship with the concentration of Cu2+ in
the product. It could be seen that the yield of CuNCs did not increase
by Ce3+-induced aggregation for samples 2–9 compared
to the original synthesis method for sample 1, since the concentration
of Cu2+ did not increase. However, both the concentrations
of Cu2+ and Ce3+ in the products tended to be
higher as a function of the adding Ce3+ after dispersing
the aggregates with Na2CO3. When 179.07 ppm
of Ce3+ was applied, almost 100% recovery ratio was found
in the product, which indicated that Ce3+ would be present
in the rearranged product after crosslinking aggregation. The presence
of Ce3+ could also be observed from the SEM-energy-dispersive
system (EDS) characterization in Figure S17. This further confirmed that Ce3+ contributed to the
crosslinking aggregation process and would be doped in the product.
However, the fluorescence enhancement for the Ce3+-induced
aggregates had nothing to do with the yield for CuNCs. Meanwhile,
EDS-MAPPING was employed for the analysis of the element distribution
for A-CuNCs-1 and A-CuNCs-2, respectively, see Figures S18 and S19. It was found that the distribution of
Cu was similar to S for both samples, indicating that the covered
protection ligand of l-cysteine played a pivotal role in
stabilizing the aggregates of CuNCs. Furthermore, by comparing the
HAADF image for different elements in Figure S19, relatively diluted distribution was found for Ce. It could be concluded
that the presence of Ce3+ was just responsible for the
connection of the dispersed CuNCs as aggregates rather than doping
with the CuNCs.

Since SEM could not reveal
more detail structure for the interior
nanosheets, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)
was studied, see Figure 6. The micrograph showed that A-CuNCs-1 were constructed by the NCs
with a size smaller than 3 nm on average (Figure 6a,b). On the other hand, the obtained images
revealed that A-CuNCs-2 were well-dispersed and their average diameters
were about 2.5 nm, see Figure 6c,d. On the basis of the HR-TEM investigation, it could be
confirmed that both the aggregated CuNCs were built with the ultra-small
size NCs as the blocks though the structures were quite different.
In addition, the fluorescence lifetime is shown in Figure S20. The fluorescence decay curve of the samples could
be fitted with a bi-exponential decay function with two components,
which is described as follows.  The results are demonstrated in Table S1. It could be seen that the lifetime
increased from 3.7 to 9.7 μs. A much longer lifetime was obtained
for the Ce3+-regulated CuNCs. This suggested that the regulated
AIE product of A-CuNCs-2 suppressed the static quenching effects of
the NCs more significantly than A-CuNCs-1.37 Herein, the more regulated aggregation leads to a stronger inter-
and intra-NC interactions. Then, the molecular vibrational, rotational,
and torsional movements of CuNCs would be further restricted, which
reduced the probability of the nonradiative path. Then, the radiative
decay could be activated. As a result, both the fluorescence lifetime
and intensity were enhanced.38

Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to
figure out how l-cysteine was protected on the surface of
CuNCs (see Figure S21). The peak at ca.
2500 cm–1 did not exist, which indicated the absence
of the −SH stretching vibration mode of the l-cysteine
molecule in the FTIR spectrum of CuNCs.39 It could be concluded that l-cysteine had been connected
with the Cu core through Cu–S bonding for both aggregates.
Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to analyze the component of aggregated CuNCs
(see Figure S22). There was a broad band
for A-CuNCs-1 at various regions indicating the existence of different
cluster species. Figure S22a shows that
the existence of Cu4, Cu5, Cu7, and Cu8 with the combination of different
number of protection ligands (L, l-cysteine). On the other
hand, Cu4, Cu5, Cu6, and Cu7 fragment ions are more concentrated in Figure S22b, which suggested that the species
of NCs in A-CuNCs-2 distributed more evenly.

Figure 7 demonstrates
the oxidation states of Cu in the aggregates by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Two binding energy peaks at 932.4 and 952.1 eV
were observed, which were attributed to the Cu 2p spectrum of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 signals, respectively. The absence
of large shake up satellite peaks from 938 to 946 eV revealed the
absence of Cu2+ species in the product. It was normally
difficult to distinguish Cu0 from Cu+ because
the difference between the binding energy was only 0.1 eV.38 However, the emergence of a slight shake up
at 947.6 eV clearly indicated the presence of Cu+. Additionally,
the broad peak for Cu 2p3/2 at 952.1 eV indicated that
Cu0 species should be coexisting with Cu+. On
the other hand, the peaks for Cu LMM were deconvoluted into two peaks
of Cu+ and Cu0 species by using the XPSPEAK41
software. Due to the presence of a shoulder peak at 574.7 eV, an extra
Gaussian–Lorentzian band at 574.7 eV was used to eliminate
the effect of other orbital electrons.40 The strong peak at 525.4 eV and a small peak at 568.0 eV in Cu LMM
Auger spectrum confirmed that both Cu0 and Cu+ were present in A-CuNCs-1 as well. On the other hand, the XPS investigation
was studied after the introduction of Ce3+ for A-CuNCs-2.
The Cu 2p spectrum exhibited two binding energy peaks at 932.1 and
952.1 eV, which could be assigned to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu
2p1/2 signals originated from Cu0 species. Meanwhile,
the emergence of a slight shake up at 947.6 eV was also observed indicating
the presence of Cu+. A relatively stronger peak at 570.3
eV and a weaker peak at 568.0 eV in the Cu LMM Auger spectrum indicated
that there is a larger proportion of Cu0 than Cu+. The XPS results for both aggregates were consistent with previous l-cysteine protected CuNCs.12 No
significant valence change was found for Cu in the regulated aggregated
A-CuNCs-2 compared to A-CuNCs-1. Meanwhile, no significant valence
state change was found for Ce3+ after re-aggregation (see Figure S23). Therefore, it could be concluded
that the charge transfer played an insignificant role for the fluorescence
enhancement here.

Cu LMM Auger
spectrum for A-CuNC-1. (c) The XPS of the Cu 2p spectrum and (d) the
peak-fitted Cu LMM Auger spectrum for A-CuNC-2.

According to previous work, the aggregated CuNCs protected
by l-cysteine were stable at room temperature.12 However, the fluorescence of the product might
suffer from
a significant change for applications due to the unstable properties
at more aggressive conditions. To quickly compare the stability in
other conditions, a water bath heating protocol was employed for the
investigation of the fluorescence change for A-CuNCs-1 and A-CuNCs-2
in neutral water solution, see Figure S24. It could be seen that the fluorescence of A-CuNCs-1 was completely
disappeared within 10 h at 80 °C. On the other hand, the fluorescence
of A-CuNCs-2 tended to be stable later after though the fluorescence
also decreased initially. This indicated that A-CuNCs-1 would demonstrate
little application potential in some cases because the fluorescence
would no longer exist or dramatically change. For understanding the
case in more practical application, A-CuNCs-1 and A-CuNCs-2 were prepared
as powders by freeze-drying for LED fabrication. The configuration
of the LED device, the optical spectra, and the CIE diagram are shown
in Figure 8. It could
be seen from Figure 8a that the LED device described a peak centered at 612 nm as fabricated
by A-CuNCs-2. An orange-emitting LED device with CIE 1931 chromaticity
coordinate, color rendering index, and color purity of (0.5091, 0.4213),
71.0, 81.3% were obtained respectively. Compared to the fluorescence
emission spectra for the colloid of A-CuNCs-2 as shown in Figure 5b (green line), no
significant red shift for the emission was demonstrated after fabrication
of the product as devices. Additionally, the CIE almost lied on the
Planckian locus, which indicated that the illumination from the as
fabricated device was extremely close to natural light.

and (b) A-CuNCs-2. (b) CIE chromaticity coordinate of the device for

the (d) inworking and (e) working emitting device for A-CuNCs-1; a
photograph of the corresponding (f) inworking and (g) working emitting
device for A-CuNCs-2.

On the other hand, the LED device described a much different
spectra
compared to Figure 5b (blue line) for A-CuNCs-1 after fabrication. Actually, the emission
could hardly be detected precisely after fabrication due to the extremely
weak brightness. In addition, the emission peak suffered a significant
red shift from 615 to ca. 700 nm. A mixed-color-emitting LED with
CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinate, color rendering index, and color
purity of (0.4974, 0.2944), 51.6, and 48.6% were obtained, respectively.
It should be noticed that the color purity was so poor that it would
be quite difficult to simulate natural light. The results revealed
that the powder for A-CuNCs-1 could not survive the heating preparation
step well for fabrication as a LED with satisfied efficiency. This
was in accordance with Figure S24 that
A-CuNCs-2 tended to keep its fluorescence in relatively aggressive
conditions, but the fluorescence of A-CuNCs-1 completely disappeared
at 80 °C water bath. However, further effort should still be
contributed to modify the stability of CuNCs.

Conclusions
A
facile method was established for the fabrication of aggregated l-cysteine-protected copper nanoclusters as 3D nanomaterials
with a mesoporous sphere structure. It was found that the aggregates
of l-cysteine-protected copper nanoclusters with irregular
structures could be dispersed with appropriate amounts of Na2CO3. Furthermore, self-assembly of nanomaterials with
3D morphology could be obtained with stronger fluorescence and stability
by the affinity of Ce3+. It was expected that this strategy
could be extended to regulate the morphology of other nanoclusters
with a protection ligand that has the crosslinking ability, which
would be a promising new path for improving aggregates with regulated
structures. Finally, these powders of aggregated CuNCs with irregular
and regular morphology were employed as color converters in LED devices.
It was confirmed that the rearranged aggregates demonstrated more
excellent illumination performance than the irregular structured product.

Methods
Materials
Copper sulfate (CuSO4), sodium
carbonate (Na2CO3), l-cysteine, and
various types of metal salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other
reagents and solvents were all of analytical grade and obtained from
Aladdin reagent company. Deionized water was used for all of the experiments.
All glassware were cleaned with aqua regia and rinsed with water prior
to use.

Instrumentation
Fluorescence emission and excitation
spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F97,
Shanghai Lingguang). UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded
with a UV-7504 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Xinmao).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed using Hitachi SU8020.
The morphology of the samples was examined by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using Thermo Escalab 250Xi
under Al Kα radiation. FTIR spectra were investigated using
a Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer. The fluorescence lifetime was conducted
on a FL920 time-correlated single-photon-counting fluorescence lifetime
spectrometer (Edinburgh Analytical Instruments, Edinburgh, U.K.).
The concentrations of Cu2+ and Ce2+ were determined
by ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher). The CIE color coordinates, CRI, and color
purity of LEDs were measured in an integrating sphere with a spectroradiometer
(Haas-2000, Everfine, China).

Preparation of A-CuNCs-1
100 μL
of 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O solution was injected
in 2 mL of 0.1
M l-cysteine at room temperature. After that, the mixture
was shaken by a vortex mixer for 10 min.

Preparation of A-CuNCs-2
For a typical synthesis process,
100 μL of 0.1 M of CuSO4.5H2O was dissolved
in 2 mL of 0.1 M l-cysteine at room temperature with the
assistance of shaking by a vortex mixture for 10 min. Then, an appropriate
amount of Na2CO3 (0.1 M) was titrated to disperse
the aggregates in water solvent until the colloid was just dispersed
as a soluble colloid. After that, Ce3+ with different amounts
was added to produce new aggregates.

Determination of Copper
and Cerium
2 mL of the mixture
for aggregated CuNCs in water solvent was washed and precipitated
by centrifugation at 4000 rpm. After that, the precipitates were collected
and washed three times using the same protocol. Finally, the samples
were dispersed in 1 mL of countertraded HNO3. After complete
digestion, the solution was diluted appropriately to meet the range
for ICP-MS determination.

Fabrication of LEDs
A GaN LED chip
with the emission
centered at 395 nm were selected. 0.1 g of the powder for the aggregated
CuNCs were mixed with 0.1 g of thermal-curable silicone resin. The
mixtures were dried under 50 °C for 1 h and mixed with 0.2 g
of the hardener OE-6551B. The mixtures were placed into a vacuum chamber
to remove bubbles. After drying for 2 more hours, the LED devices
were fabricated.
