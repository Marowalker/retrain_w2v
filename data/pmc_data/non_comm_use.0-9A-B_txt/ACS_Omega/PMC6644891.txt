Chain-end-labeled
polymers are interesting for a range of applications.
In polymer nanomedicine, chain-end-labeled polymers are useful to
study and help understand cellular internalization and intracellular
trafficking processes. The recent advent of fluorescent label-free
techniques, such as nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS),
provides access to high-resolution intracellular mapping that can
complement information obtained using fluorescent-labeled materials
and confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Using poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (PHPMA) as a prototypical polymer
nanomedicine, this paper presents a synthetic strategy to polymers
that contain trace element labels, such as fluorine, which can be
used for NanoSIMS analysis. The strategy presented in this paper is
based on reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
of pentafluorophenyl methacrylate (PFMA) mediated by two novel chain-transfer
agents (CTAs), which contain either one (α) or two (α,ω)
fluorine labels. In the first part of this study, via a number of
polymerization experiments, the polymerization properties of the fluorinated
RAFT CTAs were established. 19F NMR spectroscopy revealed
that these fluorinated RAFT agents possess unique spectral signatures,
which allow to directly monitor RAFT agent conversion and measure
end-group fidelity. Comparison with 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate,
which is a standard CTA for the RAFT polymerization of PFMA, revealed
that the introduction of one or two fluorine labels does not significantly
affect the polymerization properties of the CTA. In the last part
of this paper, a proof-of-concept study is presented that demonstrates
the feasibility of the fluorine-labeled poly(pentafluorophenyl methacrylate)
polymers as platforms for the postpolymerization modification to generate
PHPMA-based polymer nanomedicines.

==== Body
Introduction
Polymers containing
labels, such as fluorescent dyes, are of interest
for a myriad of applications. One example of the use of fluorescent-labeled
polymers is in polymer nanomedicine. Fluorescent-labeled polymers
are extensively used to monitor internalization and intracellular
trafficking of polymers and polymer nanoparticles. A number of strategies
have been developed for the synthesis of fluorescent-labeled polymers,
which lead to incorporation of the dye label either as a side-chain
functionality or at the chain end.1 Chain-end
labeling is very attractive since only a very small number of dye
labels are required and the polymer side chains are frequently used
to anchor bioactive cargo.1

Controlled
radical polymerization techniques are very powerful
tools for the preparation of chain-end-labeled polymers as they preserve
reactive polymer chain ends throughout the polymerization reaction.1 Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer
(RAFT) polymerization, in particular, is a very attractive method
for the preparation of chain-end-labeled polymers that are to be used
as polymer nanomedicines or for other biological applications.2 The RAFT polymerization method is characterized
by an exceptional functional group tolerance.2,3 By
adjusting the nature of the R and Z groups of the chain-transfer agent
(CTA), RAFT polymerization can be used to generate polymers that contain
functional groups at the α- and ω-chain ends.2−6 Fluorescent chain-end-labeled polymers have been prepared by RAFT
polymerization by reduction of the CTA-derived end group, followed
by reaction with a maleimide-modified fluorescent dye.7 Alternatively, the thiol end groups on polymers obtained
by RAFT polymerization have been reacted with cystamine, followed
by coupling of an NHS ester fluorescent dye.8

Although they have been extensively used to monitor and study
cellular
uptake and intracellular trafficking of polymers and polymer nanoparticles,
fluorescent dyes also have some drawbacks and limitations. Exposure
of polymer–dye conjugates or dye-loaded nanoparticles to the
highly degradative intracellular environment can result in release
of the dye.9,10 Another potential limitation
is the risk for pH- and concentration-dependent quenching or photobleaching.9−12 Finally, the fluorescent dye may alter the uptake or internalization
properties of the polymer13 and/or influence
intracellular processes.14

Over the
past years, the number of techniques available to study
cell uptake and intracellular trafficking of polymers and polymer
nanoparticles has increased and now also includes several methods
that do not require the use of fluorescently labeled polymers.15 Raman spectroscopy, for example, uses vibrational
labels, often isotopes,16−19 and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS)
allows the intracellular tracking of trace elements or isotopes.20−22 Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging has also been used to visualize
elements and metals in cellular environments.23−25 As a consequence,
there is an increasing demand for simple and efficient methods to
label polymers with isotopes and trace elements. Among the various
trace elements or isotopes that are available, fluorine is very attractive
as it gives rise to minimal steric alterations and possesses a high
metabolic stability.26 A number of techniques
have been developed, which take advantage of these favorable attributes
of fluorine, such as Fluoro-Raman spectroscopy27,28 and 19F-magnetic resonance imaging (19F-MRI).
In the literature, a number of side-chain-fluorinated polymers have
been reported, which were used for 19F-MRI studies.29,30

One possible strategy for the preparation of fluorine-end-labeled
polymers is via RAFT polymerization using fluorinated CTAs. There
are a number of reports in the literature that describe the use of
fluorinated RAFT agents. Fluorinated RAFT agents have been used in
the polymerization of a variety of monomers, including ethyl acrylate,
styrene, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl
chloride, and vinyl acetate. In most instances, the introduction of
fluorine was explored to modulate the reactivity of the RAFT agent.31−37 In other examples, fluoralkyl-functionalized RAFT agents were used
to prepare polymers and copolymers with perfluorinated end groups.38,39 These chain-end-fluorinated polymers were used as additives to modify
the surface properties of the corresponding nonfluorinated polymers.39

So far, the use of fluorinated RAFT CTAs
for the polymerization
of active ester monomers has not been explored. This approach, however,
would offer a number of opportunities for the preparation of polymer
nanomedicines. First, since the fluorine labels are only introduced
at the chain end(s) of the resulting polymers, any impact on the solution
properties of the polymers is expected to be negligible/reduced compared
to the use of side-chain-fluorinated polymers. Second, while the fluorine-chain-end-functional
groups can be exploited as labels for bioimaging purposes, the active
ester side chains can be utilized for further postpolymerization modification
reactions to introduce, for example, bioactive cargo. Finally, due
to its unique sensitivity, fluorine labeling of the RAFT agent may
also allow to directly monitor RAFT agent conversion and end-group
fidelity of the produced polymers by 19F NMR spectroscopy.

In this paper, we describe the preparation of fluorine-chain-end-labeled
side-chain-reactive polymers via RAFT polymerization of pentafluorophenyl
methacrylate (PFMA). PFMA is a side-chain-reactive monomer, which
can be polymerized via RAFT polymerization and which is widely used
for the preparation of reactive polymer precursors.40,41 For the RAFT polymerization, two different fluorinated chain-transfer
agents (CTAs) were used, which contain either one (R) or two (R,Z)
fluorine labels. After investigating the feasibility of the two fluorinated
RAFT agents to mediate the polymerization of PFMA, the postpolymerization
modification of the resulting poly(pentafluorophenyl methacrylate)
(PPFMA) polymers to generate α-fluorine, ω-Rhodamine Red
end-labeled poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)
(PHPMA) will be reported. PHPMA is interesting as a proof of concept
since this polymer has been widely used for the preparation of polymer–drug
conjugates.42−53

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of the Fluorinated CTAs
Eberhardt
et al. investigated the RAFT polymerization of PFMA using cumyl dithiobenzoate
and 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate as chain-transfer agents.51 Both CTAs have an activating phenyl Z group
and a good tertiary cumyl or cyanopentanoic acid leaving radical R•, which are suitable for activated monomers, such as
methacrylates. These studies revealed that 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate
was a more effective chain-transfer agent for the RAFT polymerization
of PFMA compared to cumyl dithiobenzoate.51 4-Cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate (here after referred to as CTA-1) since then has been extensively used for the RAFT polymerization
of PFMA43,44,46,47 and also served as the precursor and starting point
for the design of the fluorinated CTAs investigated in this study.
The chemical structures of CTA-1 and the two fluorinated
derivatives investigated in this study are shown in Chart 1. While F-CTA-1 contains a trifluoromethyl label in the R group, F-CTA-2 contains two trifluoromethyl labels in both the R and the Z groups.
The synthesis of F-CTA-1 and F-CTA-2 is
presented in Scheme S1. A number of factors
were taken into account for the selection of fluorinated labels as
well as their position in the CTA. First of all, to be able to characterize
the polymer end groups and to monitor the progress of the polymerization
by 19F NMR spectroscopy, two different labels are needed
with 19F NMR chemical shifts that overlap neither with
each other nor with those of the PFMA units of the monomer or polymer.
A second prerequisite is that the introduction of the labels should
not affect the polymerization process (vide infra). F-CTA-1 was obtained in a single step via N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC)-mediated coupling of CTA-1 with 3,3,3-trifluoropropylamine hydrochloride. Compared
to F-CTA-1, F-CTA-2 contains a trifluoromethylphenyl
Z-group as a second fluorine label. Previous work has shown that the
introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (such as trifluoromethyl)
on the phenyl Z-group of dithioester CTAs increases the activity of
the RAFT agent and resulted in narrow molecular-weight distributions
at low conversion.34 The remainder of this
paper will first discuss the RAFT polymerization of PFMA with F-CTA-1 and investigate the effect of various reaction parameters,
such as temperature and the [M]0:[CTA]0 ratio
(Scheme 1). After that,
the optimal RAFT polymerization conditions that have been identified
using F-CTA-1 will be used in the F-CTA-2-mediated RAFT polymerization of PFMA.

F-CTA-1-Mediated Polymerization of PFMA
RAFT polymerization of PFMA mediated by CTA-1 is generally
performed in dioxane using monomer concentrations ([M]0) of 2 M, [CTA]0:[I]0 ratios of 8–1044,47,51,52 as well as relatively low reaction temperatures (65–75 °C)47,52,53 and long polymerization times
(up to 42 h).47 To the best of our knowledge,
however, a detailed study of the polymerization kinetics of PFMA under
these conditions has not been reported. Eberhardt et al. reported
the kinetics of the RAFT polymerization of PFMA using CTA-1 at a monomer concentration of ∼2 M and a 8:1 [CTA]0:[I]0 ratio. These polymerizations were carried out at
90 °C, and the highest obtained molecular weight (Mn) was around 10 000 g/mol.51 In the present study, first a set of experiments was performed
to investigate and compare the kinetics of the RAFT polymerization
of PFMA with CTA-1 and F-CTA-1. These polymerizations
were carried out in dioxane at 75 °C using 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)
(AIBN) as the initiator at [M]0 = 1.8 M, [CTA]0:[I]0 = 10, and [M]0:[CTA]0 = 200.
Polymerization reactions were monitored by 19F NMR spectroscopy.
An example of a 19F NMR spectrum of an aliquot taken from
a polymerization reaction is shown in Figure 1. The spectrum illustrates the unique sensitivity
of 19F. Due to the difference in chemical shift of the
free and polymerized PFMA as well as that between the free and polymer-bound F-CTA-1 agent, not only the monomer conversion but also the
consumption of the RAFT agent, can be directly determined from the 19F NMR spectra. Furthermore, comparison of the integrals of
the fluorinated polymer end groups to that of the PPFMA side chains
provides the degree of polymerization. Monomer conversion ρ
(%) was determined by 19F NMR spectroscopy, taking advantage
of the difference in 19F NMR chemical shifts of the pentafluorophenyl
ester groups in the monomer (c, d, e) and polymer (C, D, E) as shown
in Figure 1. The monomer
conversion at a given polymerization time was determined using eq 1 by comparing the area
of the polymer peaks to that of the remaining monomer peaks indicated
in Figure 1 as E and e, respectively. 1  Subsequently, the monomer conversion ρ,
the initial [M]0:[CTA]0 ratio, and the number
of initiator (AIBN)-derived side chains (df([I]0 – [I])) were used to calculate the theoretical degree
of polymerization, as shown in eq 2.54df([I]0 – [I]) was expressed as df[I]0(1 – e–kdt), where kd is the rate
constant for initiator decomposition at 75 °C (7.33 × 10–5 s–1) and 90 °C (4.79 ×
10–4 s–1),55f is the initiator efficiency, which is
assumed to be 0.6 (f = 0.6),55−57 and d is the number of chains produced in a radical–radical
termination event. Since this value is not available for this specific
system, the value reported for MMA was used (d =
1.67).56,57 The theoretical molecular weights (MnTH) were calculated taking into
account the monomer (mM) and the CTA (mCTA) molecular weights as given
in eq 3. Experimental
molecular weights of the polymers obtained using both CTA-1 and F-CTA-1 for the different polymerization times
were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis using
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent and polystyrene (PS) as standard.
While this eluent and standard have been previously used for the SEC
analysis of PPFMA,45 the hydrodynamic properties
of PPFMA and PS in THF may not be comparable. As illustrated by Figure 1, however, 19F NMR spectroscopy can be used to validate the SEC molecular weights. 19F NMR number-average molecular weights (Mn) were determined by comparing the integrals of the 19F NMR signal generated by the three fluorine atoms at the
α-end group of PPFMA (A in Figure 1) to that of the PFMA polymer side chains
(E). 2   3  Figure 2 and Table S1 summarize
the results
of the analysis of RAFT polymerization experiments of PFMA with CTA-1 and F-CTA-1, which were carried out in
dioxane at 75 °C, [M]0 = 1.8 M, [CTA]0:[I]0 = 10, and [M]0:[CTA]0 = 200. For both
the CTA-1- and F-CTA-1-mediated RAFT polymerization
of PFMA, first-order kinetic plots were obtained (Figure 2A) and in both cases, the experimental
polymer molecular weights were found to increase linearly with monomer
conversion. Also the polydispersities of polymers produced with the
two different RAFT agents were comparable and slightly decreased with
increasing monomer conversion (Figure 2B). The relatively good agreement between the results
obtained using CTA-1 and F-CTA-1 suggests
that the modification of CTA-1 with a fluorine label
does not seem to influence the reactivity of the RAFT agent toward
the polymerization of PFMA. For both the CTA-1- and F-CTA-1-mediated RAFT polymerization, especially in the early
stages of the polymerization, however, it was observed that the experimental
molecular weights were higher than the theoretical predictions. This,
together with relatively high polydispersity values (>1.5) in the
early stages of the polymerization process, indicates a slow consumption
of the CTAs. The relatively slow consumption of the CTAs is also evident
from the 19F NMR spectra shown in Figure 1. In this spectrum, the 19F signal
due to the CF3 group of the nonreacted F-CTA-1 can be clearly observed next to that of the F-CTA-1, which has been incorporated in the polymer. In an ideal case, the
degree of polymerization at a particular polymerization time is expressed
as ([M]0 – [M]):[CTA]0. Therefore, a
CTA that is slowly consumed generates polymer chains having an experimental
molecular weight higher than expected. The early stage of the CTA-1- and F-CTA-1-mediated polymerization of
PFMA therefore proceeds via a hybrid free-radical RAFT mechanism.34,57,58 As the polymerization time increases,
the higher CTA conversion shifts the process toward a RAFT mechanism
and the experimental molecular weights converge toward the theoretical
values.

was performed using THF as solvent and PS standards were used for
conventional calibration. The dotted lines (CTA-1) and
dashed lines (F-CTA-1) indicate the expected theoretical Mn (MnTH).

Determination of the Transfer
Constants Ctr and C–tr of F-CTA-1
To assess the efficiency of F-CTA-1, the transfer constants Ctr (=ktr/kp) and C–tr (=k–tr/kiR), which take
into account the reactivity of the propagating radical Pn• and the reactivity of the expelled
radical R•, were determined from the decay of the
CTA concentration during the polymerization using the following equation54,56,58 4  where [CTA] and [M] are the CTA and monomer
concentrations at a particular polymerization time, respectively,
and [2] is the concentration of dormant polymer chains,
which can be directly related to the [CTA] and the initial CTA concentration
[CTA]0. Hence, if both monomer and CTA consumptions can
be experimentally determined at each polymerization time, eq 4 can be fitted using independent
pairs of input Ctr and C–tr.56,57,59 Usually, CTA
conversion is estimated by comparing the found and theoretically expected
number-average molecular weights.56 For
some RAFT agents, CTA conversion has been directly monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, but for others, overlap with resonances
due to the polymer often prevents the use of 1H NMR analysis.60 As shown in Figure 1, 19F NMR spectroscopy is a powerful
method to directly monitor CTA conversion. The 19F label
in F-CTA-1 allows to distinguish between free (the signal
labeled as “a” in Figure 1) and bound CTA (the signal labeled as “A”
in Figure 1) and thus
to directly determine F-CTA-1 consumption by 19F NMR analysis. As an example, Supporting Information Figures S1–S4 show 19F NMR
spectra of samples taken from the F-CTA-1-mediated polymerization
of PFMA at [M]0:[CTA]0 = 50 at 20, 40, 60, and
120 min polymerization time, which illustrate the consumption of the
CTA with increasing reaction time. Figure 3 plots the evolution of F-CTA-1 conversion with increasing monomer conversion in a double-logarithmic
fashion for a RAFT polymerization of PFMA with F-CTA-1 at [M]0:[CTA]0 = 200 and [CTA]0:[I]0 = 10 at a polymerization temperature of 75 °C.
Fitting of the experimental data with eq 4 allowed the determination of Ctr and C–tr, which were found to be 3 and
400, respectively. For a RAFT polymerization to display the typical
characteristics of a “living”/controlled polymerization
reaction, a Ctr of at least 10 is required.58 Very effective RAFT agents usually have Ctr > 100. In an attempt to improve control
of
the polymerization, a number of further experiments, in which the
[M]0:[F-CTA-1]0 ratio (from 200
to 100 and 50) as well as the polymerization temperature (90 °C
instead of 75 °C) was varied, were performed and Ctr and C–tr were determined using the
same procedure. Table 1 lists the Ctr and C–tr values determined from these experiments. The corresponding plots
of ln[F-CTA-1] versus ln[M] and the respective fits are
included in Supporting Information Figure S5. The results in Table 1 suggest a minor increase in Ctr upon
increasing the polymerization temperature as well as upon decreasing
[M]0:[CTA]0 at a given temperature. Analysis
of the corresponding polymerization kinetics, as well as of the evolution
of polymer molecular weight and polydispersity upon decreasing [M]0:[CTA]0 or increasing the polymerization temperature
to 90 °C, however, still points toward a hybrid-type polymerization
behavior and no significant improvement in Mw/Mn was observed (see Figure 4 for T = 75 °C and Supporting Information Figure S6 for T = 90 °C).

RAFT Polymerization of PFMA Using F-CTA-2
F-CTA-2 contains a fluorinated
label in
both the R(α) and Z(ω) groups. As illustrated in Figure 5, the fluorinated
chain ends derived from the R and Z groups of F-CTA-2 give rise to different 19F NMR chemical shifts. This
is attractive as it does not only allow to use 19F NMR
spectroscopy to directly monitor F-CTA-2 consumption
during polymerization, but also to assess end-group fidelity by comparison
of the integrals associated to the α (A) and ω (B) chain-end-terminal
CF3 groups. Polymerization experiments with F-CTA-2 were carried out at 90 °C using both [M]0:[CTA]0 = 100 and [M]0:[CTA]0 = 50. Table S2 summarizes the results of these experiments,
and Figure 6 shows
the polymerization kinetics as well as evolution of polymer molecular
weight for these polymerization experiments. The polymerization kinetics
using F-CTA-2 were slightly slower compared to the F-CTA-1-mediated polymerization of PFMA (see Supporting Information Figure S6). Similar to what was observed for F-CTA-1, the experimental molecular weights, in particular
at low monomer conversion, were higher than the expected polymer molecular
weights. To explain these observations, Ctr and C–tr were determined as discussed
above for F-CTA-1. Examples of 19F NMR spectra
of the polymers obtained using [M]0:[CTA]0 =
50 are reported in Supporting Information Figures S7–S10. The resulting Ctr and C–tr values for F-CTA-2 were 4.0 and 390.1 and 4.8 and 370.1 for [M]0:[CTA]0 = 100 and 50, respectively (Table 1). These numbers are close to those obtained
for F-CTA-1 at the same polymerization temperature, which
indicates that (i) the introduction of a fluorinated label at the
Z-group of F-CTA-2 does not significantly affect the
reactivity of F-CTA-2 compared to that of F-CTA-1 and (ii) the polymerization of PFMA with F-CTA-2 is
best described as a hybrid free-radical RAFT polymerization process
(as it was the case for F-CTA-1, as discussed above).

(Δ). SEC analysis was performed using THF as solvent, and PS
standards were used for conventional calibration. The dashed lines
indicate the theoretical Mn (MnTH) expected for the different conditions.

The difference in 19F NMR chemical shifts of CF3 groups A and B in F-CTA-2 can be used to assess the end-group
fidelity of the PPFMA polymers
produced with this CTA (Figure 5). The end-group fidelity, expressed as ω/α ratio,
was calculated directly using the integrals derived from the A (α) and B (ω) fluorine peaks incorporated
in the polymer. It should be mentioned that due to the presence of
initiator-derived side chains, the ω/α values might be
slightly overestimated; however, in general, when high [CTA]0:[I]0 ratios are used, the extent of polymer chains lacking
α-end-group functionalities can be neglected.61 The obtained ω/α ratios for the two polymerization
conditions for the different polymerization times are reported in Table 2. It was found that
for both conditions, the initial ω/α ratios were close
to unity and only slightly decreased up to values around 0.86 upon
increasing the polymerization time. This suggests that only a minor
loss of ω-end groups might occur during the course of the polymerization.

Postpolymerization Modification
After studying the
ability of F-CTA-1 and F-CTA-2 to mediate
the RAFT polymerization of PFMA, the postpolymerization modification
of the resulting polymers to generate double chain-end-labeled PHPMA
polymers containing a 19F label at the α-terminus
and a Rhodamine Red label at the other chain end was assessed (Scheme 2). To this end, the
α-fluorinated PPFMA precursor (Mn = 30 200 g/mol by SEC) was first postmodified with 1-amino-2-propanol
to give the corresponding α-fluorinated PHPMA derivative. Comparison
of the 19F NMR spectra of the PPFMA precursor (Figure 7A) and the corresponding
PHPMA derivative (Figure 7B) suggests quantitative aminolysis of the side-chain pentafluorophenyl
ester groups. Subsequently, the ω PHPMA end groups were reduced
and the resulting thiol moieties reacted with a maleimide-Rhodamine
Red dye via Michael addition. While an excess of 1-amino-2-propanol
was used in the first reaction step, the thiol–maleimide coupling
of the rhodamine dye was found to proceed much more efficient after
an additional NaBH4-mediated reduction, which indicates
that presumably not all thioester end groups were cleaved via aminolysis
by 1-amino-2-propanol. The 19F NMR spectra of the α-fluorinated
PPFMA precursor, the α-fluorinated PHPMA, and the α-fluorinated
PHPMA–rhodamine conjugate are shown in Figure 7. The percentage of end-group functionalization
with the fluorescent dye was determined by UV spectroscopy measurements
using the calibration curve reported in Figure S12 and was estimated to be 80%.

Conclusions
19F-labeled PHPMA polymers are
a potentially interesting
platform to generate polymer nanomedicines whose cellular internalization
and intracellular trafficking can be monitored using fluorescent label-free
techniques, such as NanoSIMS. A first important step toward such polymers
is to develop synthetic protocols that allow access to these 19F chain-end-labeled materials. This paper has elaborated
a synthetic strategy that is based on the RAFT polymerization of PFMA,
mediated by two new RAFT CTAs that contain either 1 (F-CTA-1) or 2 (F-CTA-2) 19F-labels, followed by
postpolymerization modification of the PFMA side-chain functional
groups. The polymerization properties of the fluorinated CTAs were
investigated in depth and compared to that of 4-cyanopentanoic acid
dithiobenzoate (CTA-1), which is frequently used for
the RAFT polymerization of PFMA. 19F NMR spectroscopy revealed
that these two RAFT agents possessed unique chemical shifts that allowed
to directly monitor CTA conversion (as well as to determine end-group
fidelity). It was found that the introduction of 1 or 2 fluorine labels
does not significantly alter the polymerization behavior of the CTAs.
For both CTA-1 and the two fluorinated analogues, the
polymerization of PFMA was found to proceed via a hybrid free-radical
RAFT mechanism. 19F NMR analysis of polymers produced using F-CTA-2 revealed end-group fidelities of ∼90%. These 19F-labeled reactive PPFMA polymers are attractive precursors
for the synthesis of PHPMA-based polymer nanomedicines. As a first
proof of concept, an α-19F-labeled PPFMA was converted
via a three-step postpolymerization strategy into an α-19F, ω-Rhodamine Red-labeled PHPMA polymer. Access to
such double-labeled polymers is crucial to further the understanding
of the cellular internalization and intracellular trafficking of polymer–drug
conjugates. While the Rhodamine Red label allows to monitor uptake
via flow cytometry or confocal microscopy, the 19F label
opens the way to high-resolution mapping of intracellular pathways
using NanoSIMS.

Procedures
Synthesis
of F-CTA-1
The synthesis of F-CTA-1 is outlined in Scheme S1A. 4-Cyanopentanoic
acid dithiobenzoate (CTA-1, 500.0
mg, 1.79 mmol) and (EDC·HCl) (411.6 mg, 2.15 mmol) were dissolved
in 8 mL of dry DCM, and the solution was cooled down to 0 °C
and stirred under nitrogen. In a second flask, 214.0 mg (1.43 mmol)
of 3,3,3-trifluoropropylamine hydrochloride was dissolved in 8 mL
of dry DCM and 250 μL (1.43 mmol) of triethylamine was added.
After 10 min, the 3,3,3-trifluoropropylamine solution was added dropwise
to the first solution and the reaction was stirred at room temperature
for 2 h. After that, the solution was washed with 5% NaHCO3 and brine, dried over MgSO4, and finally dried under
vacuum. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography using
ethyl acetate/hexane 4.5:5.5 to give a dark pink product (73% yield). 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra of F-CTA-1 are included in Figures S13–S15. The electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrum image is shown
in Figure S16. Anal. calcd for C16H17F3N2OS2: C, 51.32;
N, 7.48; H, 4.58. Found: C, 52.58; N, 7.41; H, 4.93.

Synthesis
of F-CTA-2
The synthesis of F-CTA-2 is outlined in Scheme S1B. Under a dry,
nitrogen atmosphere, a flask was charged with 69.4
g of 30% sodium methoxide solution (0.39 mol), followed by 13.3 g
of anhydrous methanol and finally rapid addition of 5.4 g (0.17 mol)
of elemental sulfur. The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 70 °C
with continuous stirring for 30 min. After that, 15.0 g (0.08 mol)
of 4-(chloromethyl)benzotrifluoride was added dropwise via an addition
funnel over a period of 1 h. The reaction mixture was kept at 70 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 h. After this time, the reaction
was stopped by cooling down to 0 °C using an ice bath. The salt
was removed by filtration, and the solvent was removed in vacuum.
Then, 50 mL of deionized water was added to the residue and the solution
was filtered again. The crude product was washed with diethyl ether
(3 × 40 mL) in an extraction funnel. Diethyl ether (20 mL) and
1.0 M HCl (50 mL) were added, and the product was extracted into the
ethereal layer. Deionized water (30 mL) and 1.0 M NaOH (60 mL) were
added and the product was extracted to the aqueous layer. Potassium
ferricyanide(III) (36.3 g, 0.11 mol) was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized
water and then added dropwise to the first solution via an addition
funnel over a period of 1 h under vigorous stirring. Then, the solution
was transferred to an extraction funnel. Anhydrous ethyl acetate (30
mL) was added to wash the product, and the product was extracted to
the ethyl acetate layer. This washing process was repeated two more
times. The red solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and
in vacuum to remove the solvent at room temperature overnight. The
resulting 4,4′-di-trifluoromethyl-di(thiobenzoyl) disulfide
was dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous ethyl acetate, and the solution
was transferred to a flask. Dry 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric
acid) (2.6 g, 9.19 mmol) was added to the flask, and the reaction
solution was heated at 75 °C for 14 h. After that, the ethyl
acetate was removed under vacuum and the crude product was purified
by column chromatography using ethyl acetate:hexane (1:1.5) as eluent.
The solvent mixture was removed in vacuum and the red oily 4-cyanopentanoic
acid-4-(trifluoromethyl) dithiobenzoate (75% yield with respect to
4-(chloromethyl)benzotrifluoride) was kept at 4 °C. Next, 2.0
g (5.8 mmol) of 4-cyanopentanoic acid-4-(trifluoromethyl) dithiobenzoate
and 1.34 g (6.96 mmol) of EDC·HCl were dissolved in 20 mL of
dry DCM. The solution was cooled down to 0 °C and stirred under
nitrogen. In a second flask, 0.7 g (4.60 mmol) of 3,3,3-trifluoropropylamine
hydrochloride was dissolved in 10 mL of dry DCM and 465 μL (4.60
mmol) of triethylamine was added. After 10 min, the trifluoropropylamine
solution was added dropwise to the first solution and the reaction
was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The solution was washed with
5% NaHCO3 solution and brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and dried under vacuum. The crude product was purified by
column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane 1:1.5 to give 0.5
g (25% yield with respect to 4-cyanopentanoic acid-4-(trifluoromethyl)
dithiobenzoate) of the dark pink F-CTA-2. We note that
these reaction conditions are not optimized. The low yield of this
last step compared to the same reaction for the preparation of F-CTA-1 is most likely due to loss of material during workup
and purification. 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra of F-CTA-2 are included in Figures S17–S19. The ESI mass spectrum
is shown in Figure S20. Anal. calcd for
C17H16F6N2OS2: C, 46.15; N, 6.33; H, 3.65. Found: C, 46.95; N, 6.31; H, 3.36.

RAFT Polymerization of PFMA
PFMA (1.4 g, 5.56 mmol)
was added to a Schlenk tube, followed by 2.08 mL of dry dioxane containing
0.0028, 0.0055, or 0.011 mmol AIBN and 0.028, 0.055, or 0.11 mmol
CTA in the case of [M:CTA] = 200, 100, and 50, respectively. The solutions
were degassed by four freeze–pump–thaw cycles, and the
tubes were filled with argon. The flasks were immersed in an oil bath
at 90 °C or 75 °C. At different time intervals, 150 μL
aliquots were removed, 50 μL were diluted in 400 μL CDCl3 for 19F NMR analysis, and the remaining part was
precipitated in ice-cold hexane three times. The isolated pink product
was dried under vacuum overnight and analyzed by SEC.

Synthesis
of α-Fluorinated PHPMA
α-Fluorinated
PPFMA (100 mg; Mn = 30 200 g/mol
by SEC, 0.397 mmol PFMA reactive units) was dissolved in 5 mL of dry
dimethylformamide (DMF) (1H and 19F NMR spectra
of this polymer are included in Supporting Information Figures S21 and S22). Then, 2 equiv (61 μL,
0.794 mmol) 1-amino-2-propanol and 2 equiv (110 μL, 0.794 mmol)
Et3N were added and the reaction was stirred at 50 °C
for 20 h. The product was isolated by three precipitations in ice-cold
diethyl ether and subsequently dialyzed against water and lyophilized.
The 1H NMR spectrum of the resulting α-fluorinated
PHPMA is included in Figure S11.

Synthesis
of α-Fluorinated PHPMA–Rhodamine Conjugate
Modification
of the polymer end groups with Rhodamine Red was performed
as previously reported with some modifications.7 First, 20 mg (0.00129 mmol end groups) of α-fluorinated
PHPMA (Mn = 17 200 g/mol, calculated
from the Mn of the precursor α-fluorinated
PPFMA) was dissolved in 3 mL of an aqueous 0.5 M NaBH4 solution
and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. After that, the solution
was dialyzed against water for 48 h and the product was lyophilized.
In a second step, 10 mg of the product (0.60 μmol end groups)
was dissolved in dry DMF, 5 equiv (0.8 mg, 0.0032 mmol) of neutralized
TCEP were added, and the solution was stirred overnight under argon.
After 20 h, 5 equiv (2.1 mg) of Rhodamine Red C2 maleimide was added
together with one drop of DBU. The solution was stirred under argon
at room temperature for another 24 h. The solution was dialyzed against
water overnight using a SpectraPor (molecular weight cut-off, 3.5
kDa) membrane to remove the DMF and finally lyophilized. The product
was purified by passing it through a Sephadex G 15 column. The purification
was repeated twice. The percentage of end-group functionalization
was estimated using the calibration curve reported in Figure S12, assuming that the extinction coefficient
of the polymer-bound Rhodamine Red is the same as that of the corresponding
free dye.
