Ammonium salt is a common collector
in coal reverse flotation.
This study compared the difference of adsorption behavior on ammonium
salt Lilaflot D817M between sub-bituminous coal and silica as well
as the surface characteristic change after being processed by ammonium
salt. The results indicate that the adsorption capacity of sub-bituminous
coal is always higher than that of silica under different experimental
conditions, such as different initial concentrations of ammonium salt,
different adsorption times, different concentrations of the depressant
dextrin, and different pH values. Ammonium salt could increase the
isoelectric point of both silica and sub-bituminous coal greatly.
However, the hydrophobicity of silica enhances much more significantly
than that of sub-bituminous coal after being treated by Lilaflot D817M.
This indicates that the surface wettability change degrees of sub-bituminous
coal and silica after being treated by ammonium salt are not proportional
to the adsorption capacity because of their different surface structures.
The reverse flotation test result shows that 2 kg/t Lilaflot D817M
dosage could help obtain relatively good flotation indexes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
There are many different
kinds of gangue minerals in raw coal,
and the character of gangue minerals determines the choice of the
collector in coal reverse flotation.1,2 Research shows
that the main gangue minerals in coal are silica and clay minerals,
such as kaolinite.1,2 Fuerstenau found that the isoelectric
point of silica is between pH 1.3 and 3.7, indicating that the silica
surface presents electronegativity when the solution pH is larger
than its isoelectric point.3 Therefore,
it is much easier for silica to adsorb cationic reagents, such as
amines and ammonium salts, which have been applied in silica flotation
successfully.4−11 Similarly, when pH is higher than the isoelectric point of kaolinite,
amines or ammonium salts could also perform well in kaolinite flotation.12−16 Amine is one common cationic collector derived from ammonia after
the hydrogen atom is replaced by aryl or alkyl.2 The most common cationic collector is a long-chain ammonium
salt, such as laurylamine hydrochloride.1 Besides, the collecting behavior of the ammonium salt is to break
the hydration layer of minerals by adsorbing on the negative ends
of minerals with the positive ends, leading continuous unidirectional
hydrocarbon chains to be distributed in aqueous solution and making
the mineral surface become hydrophobic.1,2

Reverse
flotation method has been widely used in the separation
of metal minerals or nonmetal minerals, such as iron ore, bauxite,
phosphate, etc.5−8 Also, it is also one feasible method to separate difficult-to-float
coal, such as low-rank coal or oxidized coal when ammonium salt is
used as a collector.16−23 The previous research shows that the oxygen-containing functional
groups on the surface of the low-rank coal or oxidized coal could
make its surface present electronegativity and adsorb cationic ammonium
salt in the solution under certain conditions.17,19,21,23 Thus, during
coal reverse flotation, ammonium salt would be consumed both by coal
and gangue minerals.17,21,23 Therefore, it is very necessary to study and compare the action
difference of ammonium salt on coal and gangue minerals. In this research,
sub-bituminous coal and silica were used to represent low-rank coal
and one kind of gangue mineral in a coal sample, respectively. The
difference of adsorption behavior of ammonium salt on sub-bituminous
coal and silica as well as the surface characteristic change after
being processed by ammonium salt were explored and explained. The
research result would provide a certain theoretical direction for
coal reverse flotation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Results of Scanning Electron Microscope Analysis
A
field emission scanning electron microscope (HITACHITM, S-4300)
was used to analyze the morphology and microstructure of sub-bituminous
coal and silica. Figure 1 shows the form and microstructure of sub-bituminous coal under a
scanning electron microscope. It can be known from the picture that
the surface of this sub-bituminous coal sample is rough containing
some cracks and pores, which could result in high porosity and specific
surface area.24−26 The scanning electron microscope image of silica
in Figure 2 indicates
that the surface of silica is very smooth and there are no pores.
The existence of the pores on the surface of sub-bituminous coal and
the high specific surface area would cause more adsorption of reagents.

electron microscope pictures of sub-bituminous coal.

Figure 2 Scanning electron microscope pictures of silica.

2.2 Results
of the Adsorption Test
During
the adsorption test, both of the sub-bituminous coal and silica were
the whole size range samples. The adsorption formula of sub-bituminous
coal and silica on ammonium salt is as follows 1  where qc is the
equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g), C0 is the initial concentration of ammonium salt (mg/L), Cc is the equilibrium concentration (mg/L), v is the volume of the solution (L), and m is the
sample quality (g).

2.2.1 Standard Curve of Ammonium
Salt Solution
The relationship between the total nitrogen
content and the concentration
of ammonium salt Lilaflot D817M solution could be obtained through
measuring the total nitrogen content in ammonium salt solution with
different concentrations, and the result is plotted in Figure 3. The standard curve of Lilaflot
D817M is as follows 2  where the correlation coefficient R2 is 0.9996. The effective concentration range
of ammonium salt is 10–300 mg/L.

Figure 3 Total nitrogen content
in Lilaflot D817M solution under different
concentrations (standard curve).

2.2.2 Adsorption Properties under Different Initial
Ammonium Salt Concentrations
The adsorption properties of
ammonium salt on sub-bituminous coal and silica under different initial
concentrations are illustrated in Figure 4. It can be seen that the adsorption capacity
of sub-bituminous coal increases with the increase of the initial
concentration of Lilaflot D817M. Within the tested initial concentration
range, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of ammonium salt on sub-bituminous
coal does not reach saturation and has a linear relationship with
the concentration of ammonium salt. The adsorption quantity of ammonium
salt on silica also increases with the increase of the concentration
of Lilaflot D817M. When the concentration of Lilaflot D817M is higher
than 180 mg/L, the adsorption speed of silica decreases gradually
and the equilibrium adsorption quantity (8.71 mg/g) reaches 200 mg/L.
The adsorption capacity of ammonium salt on sub-bituminous coal under
different initial concentrations is always higher than that on silica.

Figure 4 Adsorption
laws of sub-bituminous coal and silica on Lilaflot D817M
under different initial concentrations.

2.2.3 Adsorption Properties under Different Adsorption
Times
The concentration of ammonium salt Lilaflot D817M was
set at 180 mg/L, and the relationship between adsorption time and
adsorption quantity was explored. It can be seen in Figure 5 that the adsorption speed
of ammonium salt on sub-bituminous coal is faster relatively in the
beginning 60 min. It is because that the concentration of ammonium
salt is higher relatively at the beginning and the quantity of the
adsorption active sites is larger. Later, the adsorption of ammonium
salt on sub-bituminous coal decreases gradually and reaches equilibrium
at about 90 min. The equilibrium adsorption capacity is 17.19 mg/g.
The adsorption of ammonium salt on silica reaches equilibrium after
60 min, and the equilibrium adsorption capacity is 8.61 mg/g. Comparing
the adsorption equilibrium curves of sub-bituminous coal and silica,
we can see that the adsorption speed of ammonium salt on sub-bituminous
coal is always higher than that on silica in the beginning 60 min.
Also, during the whole process, the adsorption quantity of ammonium
salt on sub-bituminous coal is also higher than that on silica. It
might be because of the surface structure difference between sub-bituminous
coal and silica.

Figure 5 Adsorption laws of sub-bituminous coal and silica on Lilaflot
D817M
under different times.

2.2.4 Adsorption Properties under Different Dextrin
Concentrations
During the process of coal reverse flotation,
a depressant is usually added into the pulp before a collector after
conditioning.17−21 Dextrin is one common depressant in coal reverse flotation. To explore
the effect of depressant addition on the collector adsorption of minerals,
the adsorption properties of Lilaflot D817M on the sub-bituminous
coal and silica surfaces under different dextrin concentrations were
explored. The result is reported in Figure 6. With the increase of dextrin concentration,
the adsorption quantities of Lilaflot D817M on sub-bituminous coal
and silica both decrease gradually, indicating that the existence
of dextrin could depress the adsorption of Lilaflot D817M on both
sub-bituminous coal and silica. As the goal minerals in coal reverse
flotation are gangue minerals like silica, kaolinite, etc., excessive
dextrin might deteriorate the collection of gangue minerals. Even
with the addition of dextrin, the adsorption quantity of ammonium
salt on sub-bituminous coal is still always higher than that on silica.

Figure 6 Adsorption
laws of sub-bituminous coal and silica on Lilaflot D817M
under different dextrin concentrations.

2.2.5 Adsorption Properties under Different pH
Values
The adsorption of ammonium salt on minerals could
be influenced by solution chemistry in the pulp. Figure 7 shows the adsorption properties
of Lilaflot D817M on sub-bituminous coal and silica under different
pH values. It can be seen that with the increase of pH the adsorption
quantity of Lilaflot D817M on sub-bituminous coal increases gradually.
It reaches the maximum (18.04 mg/g) at pH 9 and decreases to 16.87
mg/g when the pulp pH increases to 11. The adsorption of ammonium
salt on silica is very low under acidic conditions but increases greatly
with the increase of pH and remains relatively high under neutral
and alkaline conditions. The adsorption quantity of ammonium salt
on silica reaches the highest (8.85 mg/L) at pH 7. Therefore, the
coal reverse flotation process could be conducted under neutral or
alkaline conditions.

D817M
under different pH values.

2.3 Influence of Ammonium Salt on the Surface
Properties of Sub-Bituminous Coal and Silica
2.3.1 ζ-Potential
Figure 8 illustrates
the effect of
ammonium salt Lilaflot D817M on the surface ζ-potential of silica.
Within the whole tested pH range, the surface of silica always presents
electronegativity and the isoelectric point of silica is at about
pH 2. The isoelectric point of silica increases to pH 10.5 after being
processed in 0.057 g/L Lilaflot D817M solution because of electrostatic
adsorption, leading the surface electric potential to change from
negative to positive. This indicates that Lilaflot D817M could affect
the surface potential of silica significantly.

Figure 8 Effect of Lilaflot D817M
on the surface ζ-potential of silica.

The ζ-potential of sub-bituminous coal after being
treated
by ammonium salt solution under different pH values is shown in Figure 9. It can be seen
that the isoelectric point of sub-bituminous coal changes from about
pH 3 to pH 9.8 after being processed in 0.057 g/L Lilaflot D817M solution.
The surface positivity of sub-bituminous coal after being processed
enhances when pH is lower than 3. Besides, it changes from negative
to positive when the pH value is between 3 and 9.8. It turns out that
Lilaflot D817M could also change the surface potential of sub-bituminous
coal greatly by adsorbing on the negatively charged sites provided
by the oxygen-containing functional groups, such as −OH, −COOH,
etc. through electrostatic interaction.27

Figure 9 Effect
of Lilaflot D817M on the surface ζ-potential of sub-bituminous
coal.

2.3.2 Surface
Wetting Rate
The surface
wettability of minerals would change after being treated by surfactants.
In this study, the Washburn dynamic method was used to explore the
surface wettability change of sub-bituminous coal and silica by measuring
surface wetting rates before and after being treated by ammonium salt
Lilaflot D817M. The slope of the wetting curve obtained represents
the value of the wetting rate.

Figures 10 and 11 show the
wetting curves of sub-bituminous coal before and after being processed
by Lilaflot D817M with deionized water and n-hexane,
respectively. It can be seen in Figure 10 that the wetting rate of sub-bituminous
coal after adsorbing ammonium salt is 0.007 g2/s when deionized
water is used as the wetting liquid, which is lower than that before
adsorption (0.009 g2/s). We can see in Figure 11 that when the wetting liquid
is changed to n-hexane the wetting rate of sub-bituminous
coal after being treated by Lilaflot D817M is 0.0035 g2/s, which is higher than that before adsorbing ammonium salt (0.003
g2/s). This indicates that the hydrophobicity of sub-bituminous
coal after adsorbing ammonium salt enhances slightly.

Figure 10 Effect of Lilaflot D817M
on the surface wetting rate of sub-bituminous
coal (deionized water).

Figure 11 Effect of Lilaflot D817M on the surface wetting rate of sub-bituminous
coal (n-hexane).

Figures 12 and 13 show the wetting curves of silica
before and after
being treated by Lilaflot D817M with deionized water and n-hexane, respectively. It could be seen in Figure 12 that the wetting rate of silica after adsorbing
ammonium salt is 4 × 10–6 g2/s when
the wetting liquid is deionized water, which is much lower than that
before adsorption (0.0045 g2/s). When n-hexane is used as the wetting liquid, shown in Figure 13, the wetting rate of silica
after adsorbing Lilaflot D817M is 0.007 g2/s, which is
much higher than that before adsorbing ammonium salt (0.0021 g2/s). This indicates that the hydrophobicity of silica after
adsorbing ammonium salt improves significantly.

Figure 12 Effect of Lilaflot D817M
on the surface wetting rate of silica
(deionized water).

Figure 13 Effect of Lilaflot D817M
on the surface wetting rate of silica
(n-hexane).

The wetting rate change results of sub-bituminous coal and
silica
before and after adsorbing Lilaflot D817M are shown in Table 1. These illustrate that the
wetting rate change degree of silica is larger than that of sub-bituminous
coal after adsorbing Lilaflot D817M, meaning that the surface of silica
could become more hydrophobic than that of sub-bituminous coal after
being processed by Lilaflot D817M. This is consistent with the contact
angle results in the previous research of minerals after adsorbing
ammonium salt.21 This phenomenon is advantageous
for coal reverse flotation. However, the surface wettability change
degrees of sub-bituminous coal and silica after being treated by ammonium
salt are not proportional to their adsorption quantity shown in the
above study, which is consistent with the research of Pawlik et al.23 This might be because the surface of sub-bituminous
coal is heterogeneous, which could lead both the hydrophobic and the
polar groups of the ammonium salt to orient toward the solution and
induce a lower hydrophobicity.28,29 Also, the high specific
surface area caused by the cracks and pores on the surface of sub-bituminous
coal might be also one reason for high adsorption of ammonium salt.

2.4 Results of the Reverse
Flotation Test
Reverse flotation using ammonium salt Lilaflot
D817M as a collector
was conducted. The flotation feed was prepared by mixing sub-bituminous
coal and silica with the ratio of 7:3. The flotation process and the
index calculation were performed referring to the previous research.21 The effect of collector dosage on reverse flotation
performance is illustrated in Figure 14. When the collector dosage changes from 1 to 4 kg/t,
the ash content of concentrates decreases gradually as more silica
is mineralized and collected into the froth product. However, the
combustible recovery in concentrates decreases with the increase of
collector dosage. This might be because the excessive collector in
the pulp could be adsorbed by sub-bituminous coal. The separation
efficiency of reverse flotation decreases from 83 to 68.94% when the
collector dosage changes from 1 to 2 kg/t and then it does not fluctuate
much with more collector dosage. This indicates that 2 kg/t collector
is appropriate in this coal reverse flotation to obtain the relatively
good flotation indexes.

performance

time 0 min, and conditioning speed 1000 rpm).

3 Conclusions
(1) The adsorption quantity of sub-bituminous
coal on ammonium salt Lilaflot D817M is always higher than that of
silica under different conditions.

(2) Lilaflot D817M could change the surface
ζ-potential of both sub-bituminous coal and silica from negative
to positive through electrostatic adsorption.

(3) The surface of silica becomes more
hydrophobic than that of sub-bituminous coal after being treated by
Lilaflot D817M.

(4) The
surface wettability change degrees
of sub-bituminous coal and silica after being treated by ammonium
salt are not proportional to their adsorption quantities, which might
be because of the different surface structures.

(5) 2 kg/t collector is appropriate in
coal reverse flotation to obtain relatively good flotation indexes.

4.2 Chemical Reagents
The cationic ammonium
salt, a complex reagent, Lilaflot D817M (AKZO NOBEL), was used in
this study. Table 3 shows the chemical composition of Lilaflot D817M.17,19,21 Dextrin (Fisher Scientific) was used as
the depressant in coal reverse flotation. The ammonium salt solution
and dextrin solution were both used as a 1% solution made by diluting
1 g of as-received reagents to 100 mL with distilled water.

4.3 Experimental Methods
4.3.1 Adsorption Test
Ammonium salt solution
(1%) was diluted to 10–500 mg/L. A total of 20 mL of the diluent
was taken into the total organic carbon (TOC) test tube. The linear
relation curve between the concentration of ammonium salt solution
and the nitrogen content, which would be taken as a standard curve,
was obtained by measuring the total nitrogen content in different
concentrations of ammonium salt solutions using a TOC analyzer. The
adsorption quantity of ammonium salt on the sample was obtained by
calculating the difference of the total nitrogen content in ammonium
salt solution before and after being adsorbed by samples.

The
process steps were as follows: First, 1 g of sub-bituminous coal or
the silica sample was put into a beaker containing 100 mL of ammonium
salt solution under different concentrations. The sample was agitated
and wetted sufficiently using a glass bar. Next, the beaker was put
on a magnetic stirrer with a medium speed for 5 min to disperse the
sample sufficiently. When it reached the adsorption equilibrium after
3 h standing, the pulp was poured into a pressure filter to obtain
the filtrate. Then, 20 mL of the filtrate was taken into a test tube
and the content of total nitrogen was measured using a TOC analyzer.
Last, the test result was compared with the standard curve and the
value of the difference was calculated, which is the adsorbing quantity
of the sample.

4.3.2 ζ-Potential Test
Both coal
sample and silica were ground to −30 μm using an Agate
pestle for the ζ-potential test. HCl (25.00% v/v) and NaOH (99.99%
grade) were used for pH adjustment. The concentration of KCl used
as the supporting electrolyte was 10–3 M. Distilled
water was used in the whole process. The procedures were as follows:
0.2 g of sub-bituminous coal or silica was put into a 100 mL beaker,
and the supporting electrolyte close to 100 mL was added. Then, the
pH of the pulp was adjusted to different values after sufficient mixing.
Afterward, the pulp was transferred into a 100 mL volumetric flask
and 0.57 mL of 1% Lilaflot D817M was added into the volumetric flask.
The cap of the volumetric flask was tightened, and the flask was shaken
up and down three times before putting it into an ultrasonic water
bath for 15 min to diversify the pulp well. Last, the volumetric flask
was taken out from the ultrasonic water bath and 1.5 mL of the supernatant
was extracted for the ζ-potential test by a pipette after 15
min standing. The zeta potential analyzer used in this research is
manufactured by Brookhaven Instruments Corporation. Every sample was
tested 10 times, and the average values were taken.

4.3.3 Surface Wetting Rate Test
The sub-bituminous
coal and silica sample after being processed in 100 mL of 180 mg/L
ammonium salt solution for 3 h were used to measure the surface wetting
rate using surface tension apparatus (Tensiometer K100) after filtration
and low-temperature drying. The principle of measurement is shown
in Figure 15. In the
picture, F1 is the additional pressure,
θ is the contact angle of a liquid on a solid, F2 is the viscous resistance, F3 is the gravity, and h is the rising height of the
liquid. When the additional pressure is higher than gravity and viscous
resistance, the liquid will rise gradually.

Figure 15 Schematic diagram of
the wetting rate measured using the Washburn
dynamic method.

The process steps were
as follows:(1) The sample was ground to −0.074
μm to guarantee the accuracy of the test.

(2) A certain amount of the sample was
measured and put into the test tube, and then the tube was tapped
to make the sample compact. The height of the sample was about two-thirds
that of the test tube.

(3) The upper nut was tightened, the sample
tube was fixed on the balance hook, and then the sample tube was put
into the beaker with different wetting liquids.
