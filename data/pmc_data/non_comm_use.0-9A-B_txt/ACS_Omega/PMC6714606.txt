Silica nanostructures are widely
investigated for theranostic applications
since relatively mild and easy synthetic methods allow the fabrication
of multicompartment nanoparticles (NPs) and fine modulation of their
properties. Here, we report the optimization of a synthetic strategy
leading to brightly fluorescent silica NPs with a high loading ability,
up to 45 molecules per NP, of Sorafenib, a small molecule acting as
an antiangiogenic drug. We demonstrate that these NPs can efficiently
release the drug and they are able to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation
and migration and network formation. Their lyophilization can endow
them with long shelf stability, whereas, once in solution, they show
a much slower release compared to analogous micellar systems. Interestingly,
Sorafenib released from Pluronic silica NPs completely prevented endothelial
cell responses and postreceptor mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
ignited by vascular endothelial growth factor, one of the major players
of tumor angiogenesis. Our results indicate that these theranostic
systems represent a promising structure for anticancer applications
since NPs alone have no cytotoxic effect on cultured endothelial cells,
a cell type to which drugs and exogenous material are always in contact
once delivered.

Introduction
Vascular endothelial
cells (ECs) are the first-line barrier for
injected drugs or medical devices as nanoparticles (NPs). It is thus
mandatory to ascertain the safety and lack of toxicity of synthetic
materials even before the study of their therapeutic efficacy.

In the research discussed in this paper, we have concentrated our
attention on Sorafenib, a small molecule acting as an antiangiogenic
drug, able to inhibit the kinase moiety of the vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 and other kinases.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important
role in tumor development, invasion, and metastasis by promoting tumor
angiogenesis.2,3 Several malignancies are treated
through the use of VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).4 In particular, Sorafenib is an orally active
multi-TKI that targets VEGFR-2 and -3, platelet-derived growth factor
receptor β, and Raf kinase, all of which have been implicated
in neovascularization and tumor progression.5,6 The
Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Sorafenib for
patients with renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and
the list of indications for this drug is growing.7−12 Although remarkably well tolerated by patients, Sorafenib exhibits
a distinct pattern of adverse events (AEs) that are thought to be
related to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Potentially, life-threatening
AEs associated with Sorafenib treatment include hypertension, hemorrhage,
and arterial and venous thromboembolism.13−17 Hemorrhagic events have major negative impacts on
mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs, often leading to treatment
delays and interruptions.17,18

An interesting
general approach to limit anticancer drug AEs is
to design new formulations for their specific targeting and slow drug
release. In the last decades, several reports demonstrated that nanotechnology
can provide a promising platform in medicine for carrying and delivering
chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing side effects, increasing drug accumulation
at the tumor site, and improving blood circulation.

Nanoparticles
have been extensively applied in cancer diagnosis
and treatment exploiting their potentialities in single or multidrug
delivery.19 Therapeutic NPs can be designed
to accumulate at the tumor tissue/organ, where the active agent is
released, increasing the therapeutic efficacy by reducing the dose,
the incidence of the treatment, and the pernicious effect on healthy
sites. Moreover, once administered, NPs have the intrinsic and general
tendency to accumulate in the tumor tissue/organ compared with healthy
tissues.20 This tendency is based on the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. EPR is a consequence
of the fact that solid tumors are characterized by leaky blood vessels
and hypoxia, which lead to the extravasation of NPs.21 This effect prolongs the retention of nanomaterials within
the pathological organ.

In addition to the EPR effect, nanomaterials
can be also engineered
with functional groups on their surface (for example, folic acid and
hyaluronic acid) to obtain a more specific target toward the tumor
organs.22

One of the most interesting
and promising chemical matrixes used
to develop theranostic nanostructures is silica since its synthetic
methods allow the fabrication of complex nanoarchitectures where size
and surface properties can be modulated to control possible interactions
with biomolecules, a promising efficient cell internalization, and
specific tissue accumulation.23 Their versatile
synthesis can allow obtaining structures with different sizes (5 nm
to 1 μm), porosities, and shapes (such as disk, rod, spherical
particles, hollow sphere).24,25 Several different morphologies
of silica nanoparticles are under investigation in clinical and preclinical
tests, aimed at the evaluation of the cytotoxicity and the biocompatibility
by oral or subcutaneous administration.26 Furthermore, the possibility to obtain nanostructures that can be
broken by suitable stimuli (pH, reducing agents, light) inside cells
and tissues can allow silica NPs to properly modify drug delivery
and excretion processes, increasing their efficacy and reducing even
more their long-term risks.27,28

In this context,
we recently developed the synthesis of multicompartment
silica core/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell nanoparticles, named
Pluronic silica (PluS) NPs, obtained with a one pot direct micelles
template approach, developing many bright luminescent materials29,30 for applications in in vitro31 and in
vivo32,33 optical and photoacoustic34 imaging as chemosensors35 or
as electrochemiluminescent probes.36 Interestingly,
all of the experiments performed so far in vitro on several cell lines
and in vivo showed the absence of toxicity in the useful concentration
range.31

To optimize the advantages
and efficacy for the application of
these PluS NPs in vivo, we are interested to develop suitable strategies
for the obtainment of theranostic materials, with photothermal therapy,34 drug delivery, and optical imaging capabilities.
In this context, we present here the design of a modified synthetic
approach of these luminescent NPs conceived to entrap a large number
of Sorafenib molecules while keeping release kinetics that could be
compatible with an in vivo use.

In addition, we present also
a modification of the overall formulation
adopted to maintain the property of nanoparticles, including drug
content and colloidal stability, stable over time with a long shelf
time. To obtain this goal, freeze-drying, also known as lyophilization,
is one of the most used techniques. Freeze-drying is a process that
consists of removing water from a frozen sample by sublimation and
desorption under vacuum. Nevertheless, this process generates various
stresses during freezing and drying steps; for this reason, species
protectants, such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins,
or other polymers [PEG, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)], are usually
added to the formulation to protect the nanoparticles from freezing
and desiccation stresses.37 In particular,
freeze-drying has been considered as a good technique to improve the
long-term stability of colloidal nanoparticles, especially aimed at
drug delivery purposes since dehydration can avoid drug leaks from
the nanocarriers. The main goal for a freeze-drying process applied
to theranostic nanoparticles is to obtain well-dispersible nanocarriers,
stable over time and moreover after rehydration. This is a key factor
for the application of freeze-dried nanoarchitectures in a biological
environment since colloidal properties of the carrier affect the behaviors
during the application.38,39 The strategy that we
propose here is based on the use of PVP as a protectant to yield one
of the smallest PEG/silica nanoarchitectures as a potential nanocarrier
for Sorafenib with a simple preparation, high fluorescence brightness,
and long-term colloidal stability.40

The aim of the study was twofold: (i) to evaluate PluS NPs safety
on endothelial cells in basal conditions (1% serum) and after stimulation
(5% serum) and (ii) to characterize the effect of Sorafenib released
by these NPs on endothelial cell morphology, viability, migration,
and VEGF-induced angiogenesis-related functions.

Results and Discussion
Design
of the Synthesis of Dye-Doped PluS NPs Loaded with Sorafenib
A possible strategy for the entrapment of lipophilic compounds
by PluS NPs46,47 is based on the presence, in
these multicompartment structures, of a lipophilic task close to the
surface of the silica core.48 In this way,
we were able to obtain efficient chemosensors, electrochemiluminescence
labels,36 and photoswitching nanostructures.49 As a first step, we tried to follow this strategy
for the inclusion of Sorafenib, but this approach was unsatisfactory
since the loading resulted to be relatively low (<10 drug molecules
per NP). Another embedding strategy is based on the insertion of the
active species in the nanoparticle core during the synthesis. The
first synthetic step for the obtainment of PluS NPs is the formation
of Pluronic F-127 micelles; the inclusion of Sorafenib into the micelle
dispersion led, in few minutes, to the complete dissolution of the
drug, otherwise insoluble in water. In the standard synthetic procedure,
this is followed by a second step in which the silica precursor used
for the formation of the PluS NPs, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS),31 undergoes condensation in the acidic aqueous
media.43 This synthetic strategy led again
to a quite low Sorafenib entrapment in the NPs, which we attributed
to a not sufficiently fast (hours) hydrolysis kinetic of the ethoxysilane
derivative in these conditions. This finding prompted us to substitute
TEOS with tetramethoxyorthosilicate (TMOS), which is more reactive
toward hydrolysis and condensation and can react completely in a shorter
timeframe.

To obtain fluorescent NPs, we inserted at this stage
a trimethoxysilane derivative of rhodamine B (RB) to covalently attach
the dye to the silica matrix (Figure 1). Also, in this case, the choice of the derivative
was adopted because of its faster kinetics; the use of the analogous
triethoxysilane derivative lead to a 5-fold smaller doping degree
(data not shown). It is important to underline that the use of rhodamine
was made here to optimize the performances of the NPs for in vitro
studies since microscopes are seldom equipped for near-infrared (NIR)
light excitation and detection. However, the versatility of the synthesis
of PluS NPs opens up the possibility to use a wide range of dyes including
NIR ones, as cyanines, that could allow for in vivo fluorescence imaging,
photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal therapy.29−34

(SRF)-loaded Pluronic F-127 silica nanoparticles functionalized with
rhodamine.

The importance to limit the release
of Sorafenib during synthesis
suggested also to change the purification system, moving from dialysis
(∼1 day) to a much faster size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
separation (Sephadex G-25), using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
as the mobile phase. From transmission electron microscopy images
[see the Supporting Information (SI)],
it is possible to observe that the diameter of the silica core is
10 ± 1 nm, whereas the hydrodynamic diameter obtained with dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements (see SI) was 30 nm. This value is slightly larger than the usual hydrodynamic
diameter measured for PluS NPs (25 nm), probably because of the use
of TMOS instead of TEOS. The possible limitation related to the storage
of PluS NPs stock dispersion, in which Sorafenib can leach from the
NPs, has been addressed, optimizing a lyophilization protocol (reported
in the Experimental Section) to obtain PluS
NPs in the form of a “ready to use” water-dispersible
solid powder. The choice of PVP K30 as the protecting agent was motivated
by the fact that it is a water soluble, cheap, and nontoxic polymer
for the efficient passivation of surfaces. In addition, PVP was preliminarily
tested to assess its potential cytotoxic effect. Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to PVP concentrations ranging
from 1 to 100 nM, in excess with respect to the final formulation.
Our experiments did not evidence any toxic effect on cell viability
(see SI, p S7). This step provided a formulation
of SRF-PluS NPs with long-term shelf stability that is not affected
by any drug release after preparation. The final averaged dye doping
degree consists of six rhodamine B moieties, conferring to the NPs
a quite high brightness (εNPs,565nm = 6 × 105 M–1 cm–1; ΦF = 0.21, Table 1), making them suitable for optical imaging. As far as the drug loading
was concerned, each NP was able to host 45 Sorafenib molecules (Table 1), a very significant
amount considering the small total volume of the nanostructure. After
this preparation, 1 mg of lyophilized solid corresponds to 25 μg
of Sorafenib. This formulation was used for all of the following experiments.

Sorafenib Release and Nanoparticle Stability
The absorption
spectrum of Sorafenib inside the nanoparticles presents a very similar
profile to the one shown by the drug in methanol solution, with an
absorption maximum at 265 nm. As already mentioned, the water solubility
of Sorafenib is very poor and precipitation occurs at very low concentration
(>10–5 M). This means that the quantity of Sorafenib
that is vehiculated in water by the NPs is higher than its solubility
and the drug, when released, precipitates, producing a decrease in
its absorbance and an increase in scattering. Therefore, it was possible
to investigate its release from the NPs measuring the decrease of
absorbance at 265 nm (Figure 2). This method allows the release kinetics to be directly
monitored, and it can be more accurate than other assays, such as
dialysis or chromatography, where the separation process can alter
the kinetics themselves.10,11

The amount of released Sorafenib
from PluS NPs to the bulk solution
was obtained by the equation  

The drug molecules entrapped in the PluS NPs diffuse spontaneously
and almost quantitatively during 6 h, a much longer time if compared
with the few minutes measured for the Pluronic F-127 micelle architecture,
at the same Sorafenib concentration (0.5 μM, Figure 2).

To verify the stability
of the nanoparticles, we monitored their
hydrodynamic diameter during the drug release by DLS analysis (Figure 3). The DLS distributions
confirm, as expected, that the hydrodynamic diameter remains constant
at about 33 nm over all of the observed period (3 days).

and after the drug release (red, SRF-F127; blue, SRF-NPS). Right:

The data presented so far demonstrated
that these NPs have suitable
stability and drug release capability to allow their potential use
as a drug carrier. Therefore, we proceeded with biological tests to
investigate the in vitro effects of this nanocarrier preparation on
cells present in the tumor microenvironment.

Morphology of HUVEC Following
Treatment with NPs
First,
we evaluated the cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization of
endothelial cells treated or not with PluS NPs. The concentration
of NPs was chosen to have a concentration of Sorafenib equal to the
one used, as a control, for the free drug. The localization and intensity
of the cytoskeletal proteins β-actin and vimentin were evaluated
by immunofluorescence. In the presence of NPs, cell morphology was
unaltered with respect to the control conditions (1% serum), demonstrating
that NPs alone had no cytotoxic effect (Figure 4A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed
that both in control conditions (1% serum) and in the presence of
NPs alone, β-actin labeling was spread in the cytoplasm and
stress fibers could be seen in both conditions (Figure 4B). Accordingly, vimentin intermediate filaments
were visible in both conditions (Figure 4C).

NPs. (A) After 24
h of cell exposure to NPs (diluted to obtain the similar final concentration
of NPs as Sorafenib 5 μM loaded NPs, used in the following experiments)
in medium containing 1% serum, cells were fixed, stained, and photographed
using the microscope (10×). (B, C) Immunofluorescence for cytoskeletal
proteins. Cells, stimulated for 24 h with NPs (diluted to obtain the
similar final concentration of NPs as Sorafenib 5 μM loaded
NPs) in medium containing 1% serum, were fixed and immunostained for
(B) β-actin and (C) vimentin. Pictures were taken using the
fluorescence microscope (63×).

Effect of NPs Loaded with Sorafenib on HUVEC Proliferation,
Migration, and Cord Formation
Cell survival (evaluated as
cell number) in medium with 1 and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was
monitored at 24 and 48 h. In control conditions, 1 and 5% serum, HUVEC
cells increased in number with time. The growth was higher with 5%
FBS. Incubation of the cells with NPs alone or with SRF-PluS NPs had
no effect on the cell number, strengthening their nontoxic effect.
On the contrary, free Sorafenib (used at the same concentration of
the one loaded on NPs) significantly reduced cell growth. The reduction
was higher with 1% serum and after 48 h incubation (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Cell number evaluated
in HUVEC treated with Sorafenib (5 μM)
and NPs and SRF-PluS NPs (diluted to obtain the similar final concentration
of Sorafenib) for 24 and 48 h. The experiments were performed in medium
containing 1 and 5% of serum. Data were expressed as cells counted/well
± standard error (SE). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs control
conditions.

Inhibition of cell proliferation
induced by free Sorafenib was
accompanied by an impairment of cell migration evaluated by the scratch
assay (Figure 6). In
control conditions (1 and 5% serum added to the medium) and in the
presence of NPs, the wounds completely healed. On the contrary, free
Sorafenib inhibited cell migration. When Sorafenib was loaded on NPs,
the impairment of cell migration was lower (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Cell migration was evaluated using the scratch
assay on HUVEC treated
with Sorafenib (5 μM) and NPs and SRF-PluS NPs (diluted to obtain
the similar final concentration of Sorafenib). The experiments were
performed in medium containing 1 and 5% of serum. Representative pictures
of wounded cell monolayers are shown on the right. The bar graph represents
the quantification of cell migration expressed as the percentage of
the wound area.

Finally, cord formation on Matrigel
was evaluated as a morphometric
assay of in vitro angiogenesis. While in the basal condition of untreated
cells HUVEC was organized in cords and networks with interconnected
circles, in all of the other conditions (free Sorafenib, NPs alone,
and SRF-PluS NPs), the formation of circles was completely blunted
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Morphogenic
assay on Matrigel was performed on HUVEC treated with
Sorafenib (5 μM) and NPs and SRF-PluS NPs (diluted to obtain
the similar final concentration of Sorafenib) in medium containing
5% FBS. Representative pictures of network organization are shown
on the right. The bar graph represents the quantification of the number
of circles monitored after 18 h.

From these series of data obtained on freshly prepared and loaded
NPs, nontoxic per se, we can hypothesize that the Sorafenib inhibitory
effect on endothelial cells (both quiescent and stimulated with serum)
is reduced when the drug is loaded on silica NPs, from which it is
released partially and slowly during time, with respect to the free
drug, which massively blunts the responses of endothelial cells.

Effect of NPs Loaded with Sorafenib on VEGF-Induced Angiogenic
Activity in HUVEC
Next, the antiangiogenic effects of Sorafenib-loaded
NPs were assayed in different in vitro assays and in the molecular
readout of VEGF-induced receptor activation, namely, phosphorylation
of ERK1/2. First, the antiproliferative effect of Sorafenib was tested
on endothelial cells exposed to VEGF (25 ng/mL) in medium with 0.1%
serum. In these conditions, after 24 h, VEGF doubled the number of
cells. This effect was inhibited by free Sorafenib, NPs, and SRF-PluS
NPs, in a similar manner. NPs alone tended to have some inhibitory
activity per se (Figure 8A).

Figure 8 Effect of Sorafenib-loaded NPs on VEGF-induced EC proliferation
and migration. (A) Cell number evaluated in HUVEC treated with Sorafenib
(5 μM) and NPs and SRF-PluS NPs (diluted to obtain the similar
final concentration of Sorafenib), with or without VEGF (25 ng/mL),
for 24 h. The experiment was performed in medium containing 0.1% FBS.
Data were expressed as cells counted/well ± SE. (B) Cell migration
was evaluated using the scratch assay on HUVEC pretreated (6 h) with
NPs and SRF-PluS NPs (diluted to obtain the similar final concentration
of Sorafenib 5 μM), with or without VEGF (25 ng/mL); the experiment
was performed in medium containing 0.1% FBS. Representative pictures
of wounded cell monolayers are shown.

The effect of SRF-PluS NPs was tested on HUVEC migration induced
by VEGF (25 ng/mL) in medium containing 0.1% FBS. Similar to proliferation,
the inhibitory effect on VEGF-induced HUVEC migration was obtained
with Sorafenib released by silica NPs, with NPs alone being inhibitory
but less effective (Figure 8B). The inhibitory effect of NPs alone could be due to the
experimental condition used to reveal the proangiogenic effect of
VEGF, i.e., a very low serum condition.

Next, the potential
inhibitory effect of Sorafenib on the molecular
readout of VEGF-induced activation in endothelial cells was assessed
by means of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 9). Indeed, VEGFR-2 activation by VEGF in
target cells leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade
with the final ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Cells were pretreated for 6
h with the test substances and then stimulated with VEGF (25 ng/mL)
for 10 min. VEGF alone and in the presence of NPs induced a strong
ERK1/2 activation, whereas the pretreatment with Sorafenib alone or
released by silica NPs completely prevented MAPK signaling ignited
by VEGF. The effect of 1 and 5 μM Sorafenib released by NPs
was similar, documenting that these two concentrations were maximal.
Overlapping results were obtained by pretreating the cells with NPs
for 1 h, suggesting that 1 h is enough to release active Sorafenib.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we present here a new interesting platform for theranostics
that we have designed and prepared, taking advantage of the versatility
of the silica synthetic strategies, i.e., fluorescent silica core/PEG
shell nanoparticles, named PluS NPs, with a high loading ability of
Sorafenib moieties, up to 45 molecules per NP, and with a much slower
release compared to the analogous micellar system. An added value
is their long shelf stability that has been obtained by an efficient
lyophilization of the Sorafenib-loaded NPs (SRF-PluS NPs). Interestingly,
we demonstrated that SRF-PluS NPs are able to inhibit cell proliferation,
migration, and network formation and that the drug, once released,
completely prevents endothelial cell responses and postreceptor MAPK
signaling ignited by VEGF, one of the major players of tumor angiogenesis.
Our in vitro data document that this innovative preparation is safe,
but only animal studies will definitely document both its safety and
efficacy in models of pathology, parameters strongly necessary before
any use in the clinic. The versatility of the synthesis of PluS NPs
can also allow their doping with NIR emitting dyes, as cyanines, possibly
yielding nanostructures able to combine optical imaging, photoacoustic
imaging, drug delivery, and photothermal therapy, further increasing
their theranostic potential.

Experimental Section
The UV–vis
spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda
45 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were recorded with
a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter. All of the samples were placed
in a quartz cuvette with 1 cm optical path length. Hydrodynamic diameters
and size distributions of PluS NPs, Sorafenib-loaded PluS NPs (SRF-PluS
NPs), and SRF-F127 micelles were determined using dynamic light scattering
(DLS). DLS measurements were carried out using a Malvern Zetasizer
Nanoseries equipped with a 633 nm laser. All DLS measurements were
performed in PBS (pH 7.4) at 25 °C and at a scattering angle
of 173°. For each sample, mean hydrodynamic sizes and polydispersity
index (PDI) were determined from three measurements of the autocorrelation
function using cumulant analysis. Reported mean hydrodynamic diameters
for each condition were determined by averaging values from triplicate
measurements. Errors on mean hydrodynamic diameters were calculated
from the standard deviation (SD) of values obtained from triplicate
measurements.

Materials
Reagents and solvents were used as received
without further purification: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 98%, reagent
grade, Sigma), methanol (98%, reagent grade, Sigma), water (Milli-Q,
18.2 μS), tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS, 98%, Sigma), Sorafenib
tosylate (SRF, 99%, Santa Cruz Biotech), Pluronic F-127 [avg. molecular
weight (MW) = 12 600 g/mol, Bioreagent, Sigma, F-127], 3-isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane
(95%, Gelest), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) K30 (avg. MW = 40 000
g/mol, Sigma, PVP), triethylamine (TEA, reagent grade, Sigma), Sephadex
G-25 (Sigma), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, tablet, Sigma).

Rhodamine B Trimethoxysilane Derivative Synthesis
Rhodamine
B piperazine derivative (10 mg, 1.9 × 10–5 mol,
1 equiv)41 was dissolved in a 1.5 mL plastic
tube containing 0.5 mL of DMSO. Then, 3.3 × 10–6 L 3-isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane (1.9 × 10–5 mol, 1 equiv) and 6 × 10–6 L TEA (3.8 ×
10–5 mol, 2 equiv) were added. The reaction mixture
was stirred for 30 min and then used directly for the nanoparticle
preparation without any further purification.

Synthesis of PluS NPs Loaded
with Sorafenib (SRF-PluS NPs)
The synthesis of Sorafenib
tosylate-loaded silica nanoparticles
(SRF-PluS NPs) was carried out adapting previously reported strategies.42,43 The process started with the dissolution in a 20 mL scintillation
vial containing 2 mL of methanol, 19 mg of Sorafenib tosylate (2.98
× 10–5 mol SRF-NPs, 0 mg for control NPs),
and 200 mg of Pluronic F-127. The organic solvent was removed under
vacuum, and a well-dried solid was recovered. This solid was dissolved
in 3.2 mL of PBS (pH 7.4). After the complete dissolution of the surfactant
and of the drug, 50 μL of a 38 mM DMSO solution of rhodamine
B trimethoxysilane derivative was added [RB-Si(OMe)3].
Then, 250 μL of TMOS (1.68 × 10–3 mol)
was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 45 min. A volume of 0.5 mL of NPs suspension was purified by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Sephadex G-25 (8 mL), obtaining
a final volume of 1.5 mL.

NPs Freeze-Drying
To 1.5 mL of the
purified nanoparticle
solution, 100 μL of PVP K30 (10 wt %) was added as a stabilizing
agent for the freeze-drying step. The solution, then, was immediately
frozen with liquid nitrogen and then freeze-dried for 24 h at −50
°C under vacuum (about 10–3 atm) using a LABCO
freeze dryer. At the end of the dehydration procedure, a fine pink
powder was recovered and stored at about −18 °C. The nanoparticles
resuspended even after a period of 6 months after the freeze-drying
maintained their colloidal and drug release properties. The amount
of SRF contained in 1 mg of lyophilized solid corresponds to 25 μg
(drug loading has been observed to be constant up to 6 months after
the preparation). The final averaged dye and drug doping degree consist
of six rhodamine B and 45 SRF molecules per nanoparticle, respectively.

Estimation of the Nanoparticle Dye/Drug content
The
average number of dyes per particle was computed as previously reported,30,42 considering the molar extinction coefficient of the nanoparticles
at λ = 565 nm (rhodamine B signal) before and after the lyophilization
and dividing this value by the molar extinction coefficient of rhodamine
B (εEtOH, 565 nm = 1 × 105 M–1 cm–1). The concentration
of NPs obtained with this synthetic procedure has been evaluated with
different experimental techniques as previously reported.42 The signal of the rhodamine B in the nanoparticle
dispersion was used as an internal reference to compute the average
number of Sorafenib molecules physically entrapped inside the NP,
considering the molar extinction coefficient of the drug in methanol
(εMeOH, 267 nm = 3.9 × 104 M–1 cm–1).

Drug Release
Kinetics
UV–vis analysis was used
to evaluate the release of Sorafenib from the nanoparticles. The UV–vis
spectrum of the drug shows a narrow band centered at 265 nm only when
perfectly solubilized (as in the case of organic solvent solutions,
see Figures S5 and S6, SI). When SRF is
dispersed in water (even at 1 × 10–6 M), the
265 nm absorption band becomes less intense with respect to that shown
in an organic solvent. This spectral behavior can be due to the aggregation
of Sorafenib in aqueous solutions since this drug is insoluble in
water (Figure S5). Experimentally, the
kinetics were recorded with a Varian Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer.
A small amount of lyophilized SRF-PluS NPs or of SRF and F-127 (SRF-F127)
was dispersed to the same final concentration of Sorafenib (1.1 ×
10–5 M) and of the carrier (2.5 × 10–7 M) with PBS (pH 7.4) in a 1 cm optical path quartz cuvette. The
carrier was the NP or a comparable amount of Pluronic F-127 surfactant.
During the acquisition of the kinetic experiments, the solution was
stirred at 1000 rpm at 37 °C. A UV–vis absorption spectrum
each for 10 min for SRF-F127 and 45 min for SRF-NPs was recorded in
the wavelength range 240–750 nm (scan speed 480 nm/min).

Cell Cultures
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were purchased from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany) and were
grown in endothelial growth medium-2, containing VEGF, R3-IGF-1, hEGF, hFGF, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, heparin, and GA-1000
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland); 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone,
EuroClone, Milan, Italy); and 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells
were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and used until passage
10.

We have tried to characterize the nanoparticle hydrodynamic
size in serum, but, in this medium, the scattering of proteins is
so strong that it hides the nanoparticle scattering signal. At the
same time, the presence of large concentrations of proteins and of
their aggregates makes the DLS technique unsuitable to perform a reliable
characterization since the level of polydispersity of the suspension
is too high. However, in previous works,32,33 we investigated the colloidal behavior of Pluronic silica nanoparticles
in PBS in the presence of increasing concentration of bovine serum
albumin (BSA) (up to 6 mg/mL). In these conditions, we observed that
the Pluronic silica nanoparticles maintain their colloidal stability
and monodispersity, experimenting a 2–4-fold increase in their
hydrodynamic diameter (BSA concentration range 0–5.6% w/v),
depending on the surface architecture of the Pluronic silica nanoparticle.

Experimental Design
The experiments were designed to
evaluate the effect of Sorafenib-loaded PluS NPs having Sorafenib
concentrations at 1 and 5 μM. The experimental controls were
represented by no treatment (control condition, Ctrl), NPs alone (at
the same concentration as the ones loaded with the drug, NPs), and
free drug (Sorafenib, 1 or 5 μM). Two types of NP preparations
were used: the first one freshly prepared before cell treatment and
the second one with lyophilized NPs, reconstituted in medium before
cell challenging.

Immunofluorescence Analysis
The
cytoskeletal and intermediate
filament proteins β-actin and vimentin were monitored by fluorescence
analysis. A total of 5 × 104 HUVECs were seeded on
1 cm circular glass coverslips placed into 24-well Multiwell plates
and then exposed to NPs (at the concentration corresponding to 5 μM
Sorafenib) in medium containing 1% FBS. After 24 h incubation, cells
were fixed in acetone for 5 min. After blocking of unspecific bindings
with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), cells were incubated overnight
at 4°C with the primary antibodies [anti β-actin (1:70,
Sigma) and anti-vimentin (1:50, Cell Signaling, Milan, Italy)] in
0.5% BSA in PBS. Samples were then incubated with a secondary antibody
tetramethylrhodamine conjugated (Sigma) in PBS with 0.5% BSA for 90
min. Coverslips were mounted in fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich), and pictures
of stained cells were taken by fluorescence microscopy at 63×
magnification.44

Cell Number and Morphology
Cells were seeded at a density
of 2.5 × 104 on immunofluorescence coverslips located
in 24-well Multiwell plates. After 24 h, NPs with and without Sorafenib
(1 and 5 μM) were added to culture medium containing 1 or 5%
serum. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with VEGF (25 ng/mL)
in medium with 0.1% FBS. After 24, 48, or 72 h of incubation, cells
were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
to monitor the cell morphology and number. Living and attached cells
were counted randomly in 10 fields/sample at 20× original magnification
as previously reported.45

Scratch Assay
HUVECs (1 × 105 cells)
were seeded on the bottom of 12-well Multiwell plates precoated with
gelatin. Once HUVEC reached the confluence, cells were scratched using
a sterile 100–1000 μL micropipette tip to create a wound
±500 μm across the monolayer. Each well was washed with
PBS to remove detached cells. Cells were exposed to NPs with and without
Sorafenib (5 μM) in medium with 1 and 5% FBS. Where indicated,
cells were stimulated with VEGF (25 ng/mL) in medium with 0.1% FBS
after a 6 h preincubation with NPs with and without Sorafenib (5 μM).
The antimitotic ARA-C (2.5 μg/mL) was added in all of the transwells
to evaluate only migration. Images of the wound in each well were
acquired from 0 to 18 h using a phase contrast microscope (Nikon Eclipse
TE 300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 20× magnification. The rate of
migration was measured by quantifying the uncovered area of the wound
that HUVEC covered starting from the edge of the scratch. Results
are expressed as the percentage of the wound area.45

Tube Formation Assay
Endothelial
cells were plated
on solidified Matrigel (1.5 × 105 cells in a 12-well
Multiwell plate). After 18 h of incubation with NPs with and without
Sorafenib (5 μM) in medium with 5% FBS, endothelial cells were
photographed and network formation on Matrigel was measured by means
of the number of circles (Nikon Eclipse E400 and Nikon DS-5MC camera).45

Western Blotting for ERK1/2 Phosphorylation
Phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 was evaluated by western blotting as previously described.44,45 Sparse and serum-starved HUVECs seeded in 60 mm Petri dishes were
pretreated for 1 or 6 h with NPs with or without Sorafenib (1 and
5 μM) before the stimulation with 25 ng/mL VEGF for 10 min.
Cytosolic fractions were obtained by the use of lysis buffer with
the following composition: 50 mM Tris–HCl, 1% Triton-X, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl
ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride, 25 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 mM
NaF, and 150 mM NaCl. After centrifugation at 16 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected
and proteins were assayed. Electrophoresis was carried out in 4–12%
Bis–Tris gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were
then blotted onto activated nitrocellulose membranes, incubated overnight
with the antibody anti phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signalling Technology,
Euroclone, Pero, Milan, Italy) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1%
dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20, and then detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence
system (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). Results were normalized to those
obtained using an antibody against total ERK1/2 (Cell Signalling Technology,
Euroclone, Pero, Milan, Italy).

Immunoblots were analyzed by
densitometry using NIH ImageJ 1.48v software, and the results, expressed
as arbitrary density units (A.D.U.) ± SD, were normalized to
β-actin.

Data Analysis and Statistical Procedures
Results are
either representative or the average of at least three independent
experiments done in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed
using analysis of the variance test followed by the Bonferroni test
and the Student t test (when appropriate), using
GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
