Cell permeable biarsenical
fluorescent dyes built around a cyanine
scaffold (AsCy3) create the ability to monitor the structural dynamics
of tagged proteins in living cells. To extend the capability of this
photostable and bright biarsenical probe to site-specifically label
cellular proteins, we have compared the ability of AsCy3 to label
two different tagging sequences (i.e., CCKAEAACC and CCKAEAAKAEAAKCC),
which were separately engineered onto enhanced green fluorescent proteins
(EGFPs) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The cysteine pairs within the shorter protein tag (i.e., Cy3TAG)
are designed to specifically match the 14.5 Å interarsenic atomic
separation within AsCy3, whereas the longer protein tag (Cy3TAG+6)
was identified using a peptide screening approach and reported to
enhance the binding affinity and brightness. We report that AsCy3
binds both the tagged proteins with similar high affinities (Kd < 1 μM) under both in vivo labeling
conditions and following isolation and labeling of the tagged EGFP
protein. Greater experimental reproducibility and substantially larger
AsCy3 labeling stoichiometries are observed under in vivo conditions
using the shorter Cy3TAG in comparison to the Cy3TAG+6. These results
suggest that the use of the distance-matched and conformationally
restricted Cy3TAG avoids nonspecific protein interactions, thereby
enabling routine measurements of protein localization and conformational
dynamics in living cells.

Introduction
Small-molecule biarsenical
fluorescent probes enable a chemistry-driven
approach for site-specific labeling of recombinant proteins in living
cells, avoiding the need for larger protein tags that can disrupt
the structure or function of target proteins.1−3 The small size
and tetracoordinate linkage between the biarsenical probe and the
protein backbone facilitate the reliable measurement of protein conformational
states and protein–protein interactions.4−13

First-generation biarsenical probes have an interatomic distance
of ∼6 Å between the arsenic moieties, which is well-matched
to allow FlAsH (green fluorescence), CrAsH (green fluorescence), and
ReAsH (red fluorescence) to bind to a six-amino acid tagging sequence
involving a pair of vicinal cysteines separated by two amino acids
that chelate the respective arsenic moieties (i.e., CCXXCC or FlAsHTAG).14−16 Sequence differences between the vicinal cysteines permit the simultaneous
use of ReAsH and FlAsH to label different tagging sequences (i.e.,
CCPGCC and CCKACC) within a protein complex.17 However, the competition for these very similar tagging sequences
limits their applications to experiments involving target proteins
with similar cellular abundances. Additional confidence in labeling
orthogonal tagging sequences on different proteins was achieved through
the introduction of a biarsenical fluorescent dye built around a cyanine
scaffold (i.e., AsCy3) with a much larger interarsenic distance of
∼14.5 Å that matches the spatial separation between the
pairs of vicinal cysteines within a designed protein tagging sequence
(CCKAEAACC or Cy3TAG).18 Although originally
synthesized as the sulfonate derivative AsCy3_S to increase water
solubility, subsequent measurements demonstrated that the methoxyester-derivative
AsCy3_E provides enhanced cellular permeability for live-cell imaging
of the tagged proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.4,6,19

In an effort to further
optimize the affinity of the AsCy3 tagging
sequence, the spatial separation between the vicinal cysteines was
systematically varied within a family of peptides.20 Increasing the spatial separation between the vicinal cysteine
pairs by six amino acids (i.e., CCKAEAAKAEAAKCC or Cy3TAG+6) was reported
to enhance the binding affinity by 2 orders of magnitude and increase
the brightness of the bound AsCy3.20 As
previous results have also reported similar increases in fluorescence
enhancements upon binding FlAsH to longer peptide tags (i.e., CCGGSGNDAGGCC
instead of CCPGCC),21 it is of interest
to understand how the length of the tagging sequence may affect the
brightness and labeling stoichiometry of tagged cellular proteins
by AsCy3.

To investigate how differences in the length of the
AsCy3 tagging
sequence affect the binding of AsCy3, we inserted either the original
(i.e., CKAEAACC or Cy3TAG) or the recently suggested (i.e., CCKAEAAKAEAAKCC
or Cy3TAG+6) AsCy3 tagging sequence into the His-tagged enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP*) and separately expressed each protein
in Escherichia coli. Engineered tagging
sequences are within an N-terminal sequence separated from the EGFP
by a 47-amino acid linker sequence to minimize possible steric interactions
between the tagging sequence and the EGFP. The construct design takes
advantage of the long Förster critical distance (R0 = 60 Å) between the EGFP and the cyanine chromophore,
which enables the detection of fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) upon AsCy3 binding for both the construct designs.22,23 This latter consideration allows an assessment of how differences
in the engineered tagging sequences may affect the binding affinities,
labeling stoichiometries, and excited-state fluorescence lifetimes
of AsCy3_E within living cells. Binding affinities were measured using
the original sulfonate derivative AsCy3_S in lysates enriched in the
EGFP or with the cell-permeable methoxyester variant AsCy3_E in living
cells. We expect that these insights regarding the practical limitations
and relative advantages of both short- and long-tagging sequences
will facilitate the application of biarsenical fluorescent probes
in live-cell measurements of protein dynamics.

Results and Discussion
AsCy3_S
Binding Affinities
AsCy3_S binding to engineered
tagging sequences for Cy3TAG and Cy3TAG+6 located near the N-terminus
of an engineered His-tagged EGFP (EGFP*) was examined following immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification. As a control, the
EGFP was expressed with no AsCy3 tagging sequence. In all cases, the
EGFP* represented the major protein following IMAC purification (Figure S1). Relative binding affinities of AsCy3_S
to Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 were compared with that of SlyD, a naturally
occurring metallochaperone in E. coli that has previously been observed to bind FlAsH with high affinity
and coelutes with the EGFP* during IMAC purification.21,24

To assess AsCy3_S binding to endogenous proteins expressed
in E. coli, we first examined lysates
prepared from a control in which the EGFP* (no Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6
binding sequence) was expressed and isolated using IMAC affinity chromatography.
Upon incubation of the IMAC-purified control lysate (5 μg/mL)
with AsCy3_S (0.1 μM), SlyD is specifically labeled (Figure 1, inset). These results
suggest that, as previously observed using FlAsH,21 the cysteine-rich binding sequence in SlyD (CCGGHGHDHGHEHGGEGCC)
is also a target for biarsenical probe labeling using AsCy3. The presence
of either Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 in the EGFP construct results in reductions
in SlyD labeling, with AsCy3 labeling of either the Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6
binding motif in the EGFP*.

30 min incubation with AsCy3 (0.1 μM) for the IMAC enriched
lysates containing the EGFP* control (lane 1), EGFP* with Cy3TAG (lane
2, filled circles), or EGFP* with Cy3TAG+6 (lane 3, open triangles)
in 10 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7
mM KCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mM TCEP. Lines represent fits to
a Langmuir binding isotherm, where Kd =
0.9 ± 0.2 μM (Cy3TAG) or 0.7 ± 0.1 μM (Cy3TAG+6). Kd(SlyD) = 0.7 ± 0.2 μM (see Figure S1).

A consideration of the concentration dependence of AsCy3
labeling
demonstrates that both tagging sequences have similar affinities,
where Kd = 0.9 ± 0.2 μM (Cy3TAG)
or 0.7 ± 0.1 μM (Cy3TAG+6) (Figure 1; Figure S2).
Our measured binding affinity between AsCy3_S and Cy3TAG is similar
to that previously reported for a synthetic peptide by Alexander and
Schepartz, where Kd was measured to be
between 1.0 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.6 μM.20 However, we observe no significant increase in the binding
affinity upon insertion of a six-amino acid linker in Cy3TAG+6, which
is in contrast to the large (20-fold) increase in the binding affinity
reported previously using peptide models.20 These results suggest that the positioning of the Cy3TAG+6 within
the protein construct may alter the conformation or redox potential
of the proximal cysteine pairs to modify the binding affinity between
AsCy3_S and the tagging sequence. In this respect, we took care to
introduce a 47-amino acid linker between the tagging sequence and
the EGFP for both Cy3TAG and Cy3TAG+6 sequences to minimize the possible
steric interactions that could modify the conformation of the Cy3TAG.22 However, relatively modest sequence differences
between the pairs of cysteines can modify redox potentials,25 suggesting that cysteine oxidation within the
Cy3TAG+6 tagging sequence may offset possible increases in affinity
that result from the release of conformational constraints upon the
elongation of the peptide linker between the pairs of vicinal cysteines.
Regardless of the mechanism, the relative utility of the Cy3TAG and
Cy3TAG+6 sequences requires a consideration of their usefulness for
the site-specific modification of the tagged cellular proteins with
AsCy3 in living cells.

Live-Cell Labeling
To better understand
the utility
of the Cy3TAG and Cy3TAG+6 sequences within a cellular context, we
investigated the ability of the cell-permeable AsCy3_E biarsenical
probe to label the tagged EGFP* expressed in the living E. coli cells. AsCy3_E has previously been shown
to selectively label the Cy3TAG engineered near the C-terminus of
the α-subunit of RNA polymerase expressed in living E. coli, permitting visualization of changes in cellular
localization in response to metabolic conditions.4 These prior experiments directly excited the AsCy3_E chromophore,
which nonselectively excited both AsCy3_E bound to RNA polymerase
as well as any dyes remaining within the cell. In the current experiments,
we seek to quantitatively assess possible differences in the relative
affinities of AsCy3_E binding to the Cy3TAG- or Cy3TAG+6-EGFP* constructs,
as well as possible differences in their fluorescence lifetimes, which
are directly related to the brightness of the Cy dyes.26 To avoid any contribution from AsCy3_E chromophores
not bound to the tagging sequences on the EGFP, we directly excited
the EGFP near its absorption maximum at 488 nm and monitored the FRET
to bound AsCy3_E (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Live-cell labeling of EGFP* with AsCy3_E. Fluorescence emission
spectra (panels A and B) and ratio of acceptor AsCy3_E
(580 nm) over donor EGFP* (506 nm) fluorescence (panel C) for E. coli expressing the EGFP*
engineered to contain the tagging sequences Cy3TAG (panel
A; CCKAEAACC) or Cy3TAG+6 (panel B; CCKAEAAKAEAAKCC)
in the absence (dashed curve) or presence of 0.2 μM AsCy3_E
(doted curve), 0.4 μM AsCy3_E (dot-dashed curve), or 0.7 μM
AsCy3_E (solid curve). Symbols in panel C represent averages with
indicated standard deviations, where Kd = 0.3 ± 0.1 μM (Cy3TAG) or Kd < 1.1 μM (Cy3TAG+6).

Following the induction of the EGFP*, E. coli was resuspended in 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, pH 7.4) and 0.15 M
NaCl and incubated with variable amounts of AsCy3_E for 1 h at 37
°C prior to repeated cell washes, essentially as previously described.6 Fluorescence emission spectra were normalized
relative to the peak emission of the EGFP at 506 nm; the appearance
of a peak at 580 nm is indicative of FRET to AsCy3_E upon EGFP* binding.
For the Cy3TAG, we observe a significant and highly reproducible amount
of FRET associated with AsCy3_E binding to the Cy3TAG (Figure 2C). In comparison, smaller
and more variable (apparent from the very large error bars) levels
of FRET are apparent upon the incubation of AsCy3_E with E. coli cells expressing the EGFP* engineered to
contain the Cy3TAG+6. We note that these ratiometric measurements
of FRET in living cells avoid potential artifacts associated with
measurements of fluorescence intensities, which can vary considerably
depending on the expression levels of the EGFP and the differences
in the number of E. coli cells.

The fluorescence intensity of the EGFP is approximately two-fold
larger than the maximal fluorescence for AsCy3_E bound to the Cy3TAG
(Figure 2A). This result
is consistent with the approximately two-fold higher quantum yield
of the EGFP relative to cyanine dyes.18,27,28 In comparison, the fluorescence intensity of AsCy3_E
bound to the Cy3TAG+6 is about 25% of that associated with AsCy3_E
bound to the Cy3TAG. These results suggest a much higher level of
in vivo protein labeling in applications using the shorter Cy3TAG.
However, as AsCy3_E binding is associated with increases in fluorescence
intensities,18,20 comparisons of the fluorescence
intensities of AsCy3_E bound to either the Cy3TAG or the Cy3TAG+6
do not distinguish between the possible differences in either the
quantum yield or binding stoichiometries. Both of these possibilities
are consistent with the observed differences in AsCy3_E fluorescence
intensities following incubation with E. coli expressing the EGFP* engineered to contain either the Cy3TAG or
the Cy3TAG+6.

Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements of FRET
Efficiencies
Measurements of decreases in the fluorescence
lifetime of the EGFP*
upon AsCy3_E binding to either Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 tagging sequences
provide a direct measurement of FRET efficiencies that are independent
of possible differences in the quantum yields of AsCy3_E. We, therefore,
used frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the fluorescence
lifetime of the EGFP*. Using sinusoidally modulated light to excite
EGFP, we measured the phase delay and loss of modulation as a function
of the modulation frequency (Figure 3). Prior to AsCy3_E binding, the frequency response
of the EGFP with either Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 is very similar, suggesting
that the tagging sequence does not significantly affect the overall
protein fold. Upon AsCy3_E binding to the Cy3TAG+6 in the EGFP*, there
is a shift in the frequency response toward higher frequencies that
is indicative of a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime (Figure 3B). In comparison
to that seen with Cy3TAG+6, there is a much larger alteration in the
frequency response upon incubation of AsCy3_E with E. coli expressing the Cy3TAG on the EGFP*. The much
larger shift in the frequency response toward higher frequencies is
indicative of a much larger decrease in the fluorescence lifetime
of the EGFP due to increases in FRET (Figure 3A). A nonlinear least squares fit to the
frequency response data permits quantitation of the relative decrease
in the mean fluorescence lifetime and the associated FRET, which varies
from 28% for EGFP* containing the Cy3TAG+6 tagging sequence to 47%
for EGFP* containing the Cy3TAG tagging sequence (Figure 3C). These latter results indicate
that the amount of AsCy3_E bound to the shorter tagging sequence (i.e.,
Cy3TAG) is substantially larger than the amount of AsCy3_E bound to
the longer tagging sequence (i.e., Cy3TAG+6). Thus, the Cy3TAG is
a robust labeling sequence that permits facile in vivo labeling of
tagged proteins using AsCy3_E.

fluorescence lifetime measurements for the EGFP* prior to (open circles)
and following incubation with AsCy3_E (i.e., 0.7 μM; closed
circles) for E. coli expressing Cy3TAG
(panel A) or Cy3TAG+6 (panel B)
engineered onto the N-terminal region of the EGFP*. Lines represent
nonlinear least squares fits to a model requiring two lifetime components,
which for EGFP (no added AsCy3_E) is centered near 0.1 ns (61%) and
2.6 ns (39%). Measured FRET efficiencies (panel C) were calculated from decreases in the mean excited-state lifetime
of EGFP upon AsCy3_E binding, which decreases from 1.1 ns prior to
AsCy3_E binding (i.e., τD) to 0.58 ns (Cy3TAG) or
0.79 ns (Cy3TAG+6) (i.e., τDA). λex = 488 nm; emitted light was collected subsequent to a Chroma HQ535/50
band-pass filter. FRET efficiencies were calculated from global fits
to three independent data sets.

Fluorescence Lifetime of AsCy3_E
Measurements of the
fluorescence lifetime of AsCy3_E bound to either the Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6
in the EGFP* permit an assessment of possible changes in their relative
brightness.26 In these experiments, AsCy3_E
is indirectly excited through FRET from the EGFP* and the fluorescence
emission of AsCy3_E is selectively measured using frequency-domain
fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure 4). Similar frequency response curves are observed irrespective
of the tagging sequence, indicating that there are minimal differences
in average fluorescence lifetimes. In comparison to AsCy3_E bound
to Cy3TAG+6, whose mean fluorescence lifetime is 1.0 ± 0.1 ns,
there is a small shift toward higher frequency responses when AsCy3_E
binds to the short Cy3TAG that is consistent with a small decrease
in the mean lifetime, which is 0.9 ± 0.1 ns. In both cases, there
is an approximately threefold increase in the fluorescence lifetime
in comparison to unbound Cy3, which has an average lifetime of 0.3
ns. Thus, the measured fluorescence lifetimes of AsCy3_E bound to
either the Cy3TAG or the Cy3TAG+6 are consistent with the reported
increases in the fluorescence intensities associated with AsCy3 binding
to these tagging sequences.18,20 However, small differences
in the fluorescence lifetimes of AsCy3_E bound to the EGFP* engineered
with either the Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 are not the cause of the observed
differences in the relative intensities of AsCy3_E observed upon excitation
of EGFP* in Figure 2. Rather, these results collectively indicate that the labeling stoichiometry
of AsCy3_E is substantially larger using the engineered Cy3TAG relative
to that observed using the Cy3TAG+6 tagging sequence under in vivo
conditions of live-cell labeling.

fluorescence lifetime measurements
for AsCy3_E bound to the EGFP* engineered to contain Cy3TAG (circles; n = 3) or Cy3TAG+6 (squares; n = 2) (panel A). Lines represent nonlinear least squares fits to
a model requiring two lifetime components, which for Cy3TAG were 0.44
± 0.02 ns (69%) and 1.91 ± 0.04 ns (31%) and for Cy3TAG+6
were 0.45 ± 0.04 ns (64%) and 1.89 ± 0.03 ns (36%). Mean
fluorescence lifetimes (τ; panel B) were 0.9
± 0.1 ns (Cy3TAG) or 1.0 ± 0.1 ns (Cy3TAG+6). λex = 488 nm; emitted light was collected subsequent to a 540
LP Omega filter.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the cell
permeable biarsenical probe AsCy3_E can be used to reproducibly label
proteins tagged with the Cy3TAG (i.e., CCKAEAACC) in living cells.
Under similar labeling conditions (i.e., 0.5 μM AsCy3_E), we
previously demonstrated the ability to image changes in the localization
of tagged proteins in response to metabolic conditions.4 Our current measurements demonstrate that the
length, and associated conformational flexibility, of the AsCy3 tagging
sequence does not significantly affect either the binding affinity
or brightness of bound AsCy3_E (Figures 1 and 4). Rather, increases
in the length and conformational flexibility of the tagging sequence
result in large reductions in in vivo labeling stoichiometries (Figures 2 and 3), which may result from increases in the disulfide bond formation.
Although not studied here, additional advantages associated with the
use of the Cy3TAG binding sequence relate to the overall dimension
between the pair of vicinal cysteines that matches the interarsenical
distance in AsCy3, which permits the simultaneous use of orthogonal
tagging sequences for FlAsH (green fluorescence) and AsCy3 (red fluorescence)
for two color experiments. In comparison, longer tagging sequences
(e.g., CCGGSGNDAGGCC in SlyD) bind both FlAsH and AsCy3, as the spatial
separation and peptide flexibility enable a substantially larger range
of conformations.

Experimental Procedures
Expression Clone Construction
Multisite Gateway Pro
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) cloning was used to construct expression
clones built around a previously used expression vector that, when
appropriate, included an AsCy3 tagging sequence located within a linker
region located between an N-terminal 17-amino acid sequence (MKTSAIVLLAVLATTAA)
and the EGFP (∼40 kDa) within the translated protein, as previously
described in detail.19,22 For these experiments, three
constructs were engineered in which the His-tagged EGFP (EGFP*) was
expressed without an AsCy3 binding sequence (control) or containing
the Cy3TAG (CCKAEAACC) or Cy3TAG+6 (CCKAEAAKAEAAKCC) tagging sequences. Polymerase
chain reaction was performed using Pfu HotStart polymerase enzymes
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs involved separately engineering
gene fragments that, when appropriate, encode either Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6.
These gene fragments were amplified, essentially as previously described.22,29 All gene fragments were amplified with the same forward primer:

GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTTCGATTAACTTAACAAGGAGGTTTCAGCTTATGAAGACTTCTGCCATTG, where the attB1 recombination site is underlined

GGGGACAACTTTTGTATACAAAGTTGTACAACACTTAGCGGCCTCAGCCTTAGCGGCCTCAGCCTTACAACA, Cy3TAG+6.

The EGFP gene was amplified using the following

attB2 sites underlined):

GGGGACAACTTTGTATACAAAAGTTGTGGACGATGACGATAAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGC
and GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAGAG.

The MultiSite Gateway Pro system (Invitrogen, Waldham, MA) was
used to combine gene fragments containing Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6 with
the EGFP gene in the pEXP2-DEST plasmid to create three expression
clones used in this work: EGFP*, EGFP* with the Cy3TAG, and EGFP*
with the Cy3TAG+6. In all cases, the inserted tetracysteine labeling
site is located near the N-terminus of the expressed protein construct
and is within one-half of the 60 Å Förster critical distance
relative to the EGFP chromophore, which results in near complete FRET
upon AsCy3E binding.23

Protein Expression,
Cell Lysis, and IMAC Protein Enrichment
All constructs were
expressed in T7 Express lysY/IqE. coli (NEB) and grown in the Luria Bertani (LB)
medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C.
Growing cultures were induced at the exponential phase with 1 mM isopropyl
β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 24 °C for approximately
16 h. Induced cells were harvested at 6000g for 10
min at 4 °C and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C.
Cells were thawed on ice and, unless otherwise indicated, lysed in
3.5 mL of lysis buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl,
2 M urea, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
5 mg/mL egg white lysozyme (Amresco; Solon, OH), 1 μL/mL universal
nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA), and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA)]. Alternatively,
resuspended cells were incubated on ice for 60 min in the presence
of 2% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sonicated at 80% amplitude
for 1 min pulses with 30 s intervals on ice (Ultrasonic, GE50). In
all cases, cell lysis was confirmed by visualization on a light microscope
(Nikon, Labophot).

Lysates were separated from cell debris following
centrifugation (9000g for 5 min at 4 °C) using
a tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf, 5415R). Purification was conducted
using an ÄKTA start liquid chromatography system fitted with
a 1 mL HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Marlborough,
MA). The column was first equilibrated using 10 mL of binding buffer
[20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, 2 M urea, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, and 40 mM imidazole (pH 7.4)]. A cleared lysate was loaded
through a 5 mL superloop at 0.5 mL/min. The column was washed using
15 mL of wash buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride,
2.0 M urea, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.4)] at 1
mL/min. The EGFP* tagged with Cy3TAG+6 was eluted using a 10 mL linear
gradient ranging from 100–500 mM imidazole. EGFP*, EGFP* tagged
with Cy3TAG, and endogenous SlyD from untransformed E. coli were eluted using step gradients involving
5 mL each of 100, 200, 300, 400 mM imidazole, followed by a final
10 mL of 500 mM elution step. Eluted proteins were separated on a
4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA), and proteins were visualized
using an EZ-Run protein gel staining solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
Waltham, MA). Buffer exchange was conducted on consolidated fractions
using a 30 MWCO Amicon column into the storage buffer [that is, phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and 5% (v/v) glycerol] and concentrated approximately
10-fold. Protein aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80 °C.

AsCy3_S Labeling of Lysates
Following IMAC Protein Enrichment
Concentrations of AsCy3_S-EDT2 were determined using
an extinction coefficient of 180 000 cm–1 M–1, as previously described.18 Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic
acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Variable amounts
of AsCy3_S-EDT2 were added to protein lysates (5 μg/mL)
in PBS, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min in the dark. Following
labeling, proteins were denatured in the Laemmli sample buffer supplemented
with 1 mM tributylphosphine (Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA) and
a protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fischer Scientific; Waltham,
MA) by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min prior to separation on a 4–20%
Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel. Fluorescence intensities of AsCy3 bound
to EGFP* (∼45 kDa) or SlyD (∼27 kDa) were captured using
a UVP ChemStudio Imager (Analytik Jena USA, Upland, CA) prior to protein
silver staining using an EZ-Run protein gel staining solution (Thermo
Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Relative fluorescence intensities
were quantified using NIH ImageJ 1.49v.31 In all cases, a purified SlyD labeled with AsCy3 was used as a loading
control. The binding isotherm associated with AsCy3 binding to the
tagged EGFP (i.e., EGFP*) was fit to a Langmuir binding isotherm 1  where Fobs is
the observed fluorescence intensity, Fmax is the maximum fluorescence intensity, [AsCy3] is the total amount
of AsCy3 added to the reaction, and Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant.

AsCy3_E Labeling of Live E. coli cells
E. coli (1 mL) transformed
with the EGFP* alone or engineered to contain the Cy3TAG or Cy3TAG+6
tagging sequences was grown in a LB broth at 37 °C (300 rpm)
for 5 h following the addition of β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
*(IPTG) (1 mM) to induce EGFP* expression cells prior to the addition
of AsCy3_E. After 1 h incubation with Ascy3_E-EDT2, the
cells were washed multiple times to remove unbound AsCy3_E and resuspended
in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.15 M NaCl, essentially as previously
described.6

Frequency-Domain Fluorescence
Measurements
Fluorescence
lifetimes were measured using an ISS K2 frequency-domain fluorometer
(Champaign, IL), as described previously.22,32,33 Samples were excited using a 488 nm laser
diode with emitted light detected subsequent to either an HQ535/50
band-pass filter for the EGFP (Chroma Technology Corporation, Bellow
Falls, VT) or subsequent to an Omega 540 long-pass filter (AsCy3_S).
All measurements were taken at 25 °C. Fluorescein was used as
a lifetime standard (τref = 4.0 ns) (http://www.iss.com/resources/reference/data_tables/StandardsLEDsLaserDiodes.html).

Analysis of Fluorescence Lifetime Intensity Decays
The frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime data were analyzed by
fitting the time-dependent decay, I(t), of fluorescence to a sum of exponentials using nonlinear least
squares, as previously described34 2  where
αi values represent the pre-exponential
factors, τi values represent the
decay times, and n is the number of exponential components
required to describe the
decay. The intensity decay law is obtained from the frequency response
of amplitude-modulated light and is characterized by the frequency-dependent
values of the phase and the extent of demodulation. The values are
compared with the calculated values from an assumed decay law until
a minimum of the reduced squared deviation (χR2) is obtained. After the measurement of the intensity decay,
the mean lifetime was calculated 3  

Errors in
the differential phase and
modulated anisotropy were assumed to be 0.2° and 0.004, respectively.
Weighted residuals (χR2) were calculated
as the difference between the measured and the fit data divided by
the error of individual measurements (0.2° or 0.004 for phase
shift and modulation data, respectively).
