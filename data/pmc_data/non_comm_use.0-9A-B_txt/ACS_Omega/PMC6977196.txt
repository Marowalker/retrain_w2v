The preparation of 16 oxazole- or
thiazole-containing amino esters
bearing a wide array of N-substitution is reported. These were accessed
in 40–92% yield via an AgClO4-promoted substitution
reaction between a primary amine and a chloromethyl-functionalized
thiazole or oxazole. These new synthetic building blocks will be useful
for the preparation of new cyclopeptide analogues bearing heterocyclic
backbone modifications. Four macrocyclic N-substituted oligoamides
that include thiazole or oxazole heterocycles were obtained, following
cyclooligomerization reactions of azole-modified N-substituted amino
acids.

Introduction
A variety of both natural
peptide-derived macrocycles and synthetic
analogues thereof include heterocyclic units in the backbone.1−4 Thiazole and oxazole are common in natural products such as dendroamide
A, which exhibits multidrug resistance reversal activity5 (Figure 1). Researchers have sought synthetic routes to prepare azole-rich
natural products and their analogues for development of bioactive
agents and supramolecular receptors.6−8 In parallel, a number
of groups aim to modulate cyclopeptide conformation and properties
(e.g., proteolytic stability) by introducing varied heterocycles into
the macrocycle backbone.9 New, diversely
functionalized amino acid building blocks that include oxazole or
thiazole will allow researchers to expand the suite of heterocycle-containing
macrocycles for study and application.

natural product dendroamide A and of new
N-substituted azole-containing amino acid building blocks explored
in this work.

Introduction of N-substituted
azole-containing units into cyclopeptide
macrocycle backbones represents a promising but underexplored strategy
to generate new molecules for structural and functional studies. N-substitution,
including N-methylation, is known to influence macrocycle conformation
and cell permeability of cyclic peptides.10,11 However, only a single study details the preparation of N-methylated
thiazole-based macrocycles.12 Azoles have
been incorporated into linear N-substituted oligoamides synthesized
on solid support.13,14 To access new azole-containing
macrocycles that include N-substitution, diverse N-substituted azole-containing
amino acids are needed (Figure 1).

Here, we introduce a method to prepare 16 diverse
N-substituted,
azole-containing amino ester building blocks via substitution reaction
of a chloromethyl-functionalized azole with a primary amine. The compatibility
of these building blocks with both solution phase and solid-phase
approaches is an advantage for the synthesis of heterocycle-modified
cyclopeptides. Additionally, we demonstrate a potential use of these
azole-containing amino acids; four azole-rich macrocycles were prepared
by their cyclooligomerization.

An attractive approach to prepare
N-substituted azole-containing
amino acid building blocks is a substitution reaction of the 2-chloromethyl-functionalized
thiazole and oxazole esters, which are commercially available and
synthetically accessible,13,15 with a primary amine.
A chief advantage of this strategy is that primary amines encompass
a wide diversity of functionality which could translate to access
to many analogues. An analogous substitution reaction has been employed
using varied amine nucleophiles with resin-bound chloromethyl-functionalized
azoles.13,14 In solution, this substitution reaction
is less common on similarly functionalized systems. The reaction of
primary amines with chloromethyl-functionalized benzoxazoles and other
2-chloromethyl-functionalized azoles bearing aryl substituents at
the 4- and/or 5-position has been reported.16−19 It is noteworthy that these more
common substrates differ substantially from azoles used in the studies
reported here. In the work described below, we report the reaction
of azoles functionalized at the 4-position with an ester substituent;
this group is susceptible to reaction with amine nucleophiles. Furthermore,
azoles that include an electrophilic substituent at the 4-position
present very different reactivity with amines than benzo-fused or
aryl-substituted substrates. The reaction of similarly ester-functionalized
2-halomethyl azoles with secondary amines has been described,20−23 but their reaction with primary amines has been limited to a single
example.24 The scope of this reaction has
not been previously explored. This article expands the examples of
this important class of functionalized azoles by exploring the reaction
of two azoles with a variety of primary amines.

Results and Discussion
To identify optimal conditions for the substitution reaction, we
monitored the reaction of methyl 2-(chloromethyl)oxazole-4-carboxylate
(1) with isopropylamine or n-butylamine
to generate secondary amines, 2 (Table 1). When the reaction was run with a large
excess of amine in a range of solvents, amide byproduct 3 was observed (entries 1–4). This byproduct was especially
problematic because it was challenging to separate 2 and 3 chromatographically; a substantial fraction of 2 co-eluted with 3, diminishing isolated yields of 2. Changing the reaction solvent to acetonitrile improved
selectivity in favor of 2a (2a/3a = 33.3, entry 4). To promote the desired substitution reaction,
the effects of adding non-nucleophilic amines (triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene,
and 4-dimethylaminopyridine) were evaluated, but reaction selectivity
(ratio 2/3) was not improved (data not shown).
AgClO4 has been successfully used to mediate closely related
substitution reactions,25 but was not soluble
in CH2Cl2. Its addition in a different solvent
system (CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate, 4:1) improved
reaction selectivity in favor of 2. Indeed, even in the
presence of 25 equiv of isopropylamine, the product distribution changed
dramatically in favor of 2a when 1.5 equiv of AgClO4 was added (2a/3a = 81.8, entry
5). Unsurprisingly, reaction selectivity was lower when n-butylamine was used instead of the more sterically congested isopropylamine
(2b/3b = 0.70, entry 6). Notably, amines
did not react with the ethyl acetate solvent in these reactions (entries
5–7), suggesting that the adjacent azole makes the ester functional
group more reactive toward acyl substitution reactions with amines.
Decreasing the number of equivalents of n-butylamine
to five equivalents improved selectivity for 2b over 3b when AgClO4 was added (ratio 2/3 = 8.9, entry 7) more than when tetrabutylammonium iodide
was added in an effort to activate the chloride in 1 for
substitution (ratio 2/3 = 3.0, entry 8).
Changing the solvent to acetonitrile in the presence of AgClO4, only 2b was observed for the reaction of 1 with n-butylamine (entry 9). Heating the
reaction mixture at 60 °C accelerated the consumption of 1 (5–6 h reaction times, entries 10 and 11). However,
the reaction of the less sterically encumbered nucleophile n-butylamine gave a higher 2/3 ratio for the longer reaction at room temperature than when the
reaction was heated over 5 h (>99 vs 12.2, entries 9 and 10). For
all other nucleophiles, including more sterically demanding amines
and/or weaker nucleophiles, heating the reaction produced higher yields
of the desired products. Lastly, the addition of fewer equivalents
of amine was evaluated (entry 12). When two equivalents of isopropylamine
were used, the reaction time was considerably longer (52 h), but the
yield and selectivity for 2 over 3 were
not compromised. Overalkylation of the primary amine was not observed
under any of the reaction conditions explored.

Applying the optimized conditions for the silver-mediated
substitution
reaction, sixteen N-substituted aminomethyl azole esters were prepared
in 40–92% isolated yield (Table 2). Both the oxazole (1) and thiazole (4) derivatives were successfully reacted with primary amines
bearing a range of functionality in the presence of AgClO4 in acetonitrile at 60 °C. These examples highlighted the versatility
of this reaction to generate diverse secondary amines including aliphatic
(2a, 2b, 13, 14), aromatic and heteroaromatic (5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15), and aprotic or protected polar groups (8, 10, 16, 17, 18). In all reactions, no amide byproduct was observed in the crude 1H NMR spectrum. Reaction times were generally longer for alkylation
of 4 compared to the reaction of the corresponding oxazole 1 (see details in the Methods). Notably,
both azole substrates reacted smoothly with the sterically encumbered l-(−)-α-methylbenzylamine to access 7 and 15 that bear chiral N-substituents. Predictably,
the reactions of 1 with arylamine nucleophiles required
longer reaction times (3–7 days). Nonetheless, N-aryl products 11 and 12 were isolated
in useful yields. Taken together, this array of products demonstrated
the flexibility of this approach to functionalize azoles with a diversity
of secondary amines. Products from the reaction can be incorporated
into traditional solution phase or appropriately modified for use
in solid-phase peptide synthesis following N-protection and ester
hydrolysis. These are thus useful precursors to a wide array of new
peptidomimetics.

a Reaction was run
at room temperature.

To
showcase the utility of these new building blocks for the preparation
of novel azole-rich macrocycles, four of these were hydrolyzed and
the resultant acids were subjected to cyclooligomerization reactions
(Table 3). Cyclooligomerization reactions of azole-containing amino
acids have been used in several instances to access complex azole-rich
macrocycles with reasonable synthetic efficiency.12,26 Upon cyclooligomerization mediated by pentafluorophenyl diphenylphosphinate
(FDPP), acids derived from 2b produced the cyclic trimer, 19b as the major reaction product. In the earlier work from
the Pattenden laboratory, cyclooligomerization of thiazole amino acids
lacking N-substitution favored cyclic trimer products,26 whereas N-methylated thiazole-containing amino
acids yielded cyclic tetramers as the major product.12 Cyclic tetramer 20b was a minor reaction product;
other reaction products identified in the crude reaction mixture included
small quantities of larger cyclic oligomers (pentamers, hexamers)
and byproducts from FDPP (see the Supporting Information for chromatograms of the crude reaction products). Interestingly,
linear oligomers were not observed. As shown in entries 1–3
in Table 3, changes
to the number of equivalents of FDPP and to the reaction concentration
changed the product distribution, consistent with the previous studies
on cyclooligomerization reactions.26

The hydrolysis–cyclooligomerization
sequence likewise produced
cyclic trimers as the major products for the reaction of 2a, 5, and 14. Table 3 reports conditions for the reaction conditions
that produced highest selectivity for the respective cyclic trimer 19 (entries 4–6). Products obtained vary both azole
and side-chain identities, demonstrating that a variety of structures
can be accessed from these new azole synthons. Although isolated yields
of reaction products following small-scale reaction and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification were less than 13%, cyclooligomerization
was a preparatively useful way to generate complex macrocycles in
a short reaction sequence.

Analysis of oxazole-rich macrocycles 19a–c by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
in CDCl3 showed C3-symmetrical
structures, whereas spectra of
thiazole-rich 19d showed evidence of multiple ring conformations.
NMR spectral features of 19d in deuterated DMSO were
sensitive to changes in temperature (see spectra in the Supporting Information). Macrocyclic peptoids
(N-substituted glycine oligomers) of the same ring size (18 atoms,
cyclic peptoid hexamers) similarly exhibit dynamic ring conformations.27

In summary, an approach to the preparation
of novel azole-containing
N-substituted amino acid building blocks is reported. These building
blocks are compatible with either traditional solid phase or solution
phase peptide chemistry and a wide variety of structural features
can be readily appended as N-substituents. N-Substituted heterocycle-rich
cyclopeptide macrocycles, including cyclic trimers prepared in this
work, will likely exhibit different conformation and physicochemical
properties from the parent peptides. Their preparation and study is
an exciting frontier and application of the work reported here.

Methods
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources
and used without further purification. Infrared (IR) spectra were
obtained using a Shimadzu IR Affinity-1S FT spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz
spectrometer using a 5 mm high-resolution direct-detection probe.
Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million and are
referenced to residual proton in the deuterated solvent, and spectra
were acquired at room temperature for compound characterization. 1H and 13C NMR spectra for all compounds are included
in the Supporting Information. High-resolution
mass spectral data were acquired using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II
LC with a 6230 time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) detector
(electrospray ionization, positive ion mode) and were within 5 ppm
of the expected values. Melting points were obtained using an MSRS
DigiMelt MPA160 capillary melting point apparatus. Reaction monitoring
was carried out using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel
(Merck KGaA, TLC Silica gel 60 F254). Visualization of
TLC results was effected with UV light and/or staining with aqueous
KMnO4 solution. Purification of the reaction products was
carried out by flash column chromatography using silica gel 60 (215–400
mesh) purchased from Alfa Aesar. Esters 1 and 4 were prepared as described in the literature, and their spectral
features identified were identical to those reported.13

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Methyl 2-(N-Alkylaminomethyl)azole-4-carboxylates (2a, 2b, 5–16)
A solution of 1 or 4 (0.72 mmol) and AgClO4 (1.5 equiv,
1.08 mmol, 0.224 g) in 6 mL of acetonitrile was added to amine (3.6
mmol, 5.0 equiv) in 4 mL of acetonitrile in a round-bottom flask fitted
with a reflux condenser and stirred at 60 °C for 6 h–7 days until TLC analysis indicated
complete conversion of the reactant. A black precipitate formed over
the course of the reaction. After cooling, the mixture was filtered
through a Celite pad to remove the solid and the filtrate was then
concentrated in vacuo. Saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL)
was added to the filtrate, and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane
(5 × 5 mL). Organic extracts were washed with brine (5 mL) and
water (5 mL). After drying over MgSO4, the crude material
was concentrated and purified using flash column chromatography (SiO2, hexanes/ethyl acetate).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 19a–d by
Cyclooligomerization of 2a, 2b, 5, 14
To a solution of 2a, 2b, 5, or 14 (0.317 mmol)
in 3 mL methanol in a 20 mL scintillation vial was added a 1 M aqueous
solution of sodium hydroxide (0.33 mL, 0.38 mmol, 1.2 equiv). The
mixture was stirred with heating in a 70 °C sand bath for 24
h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled and quenched
with sodium bicarbonate (0.133 g, 1.585 mmol, 5.0 equiv). The mixture
was then concentrated in vacuo at 25 °C, and the solid residue
was suspended in 3 mL water/acetonitrile (1:1), frozen, and lyophilized
overnight. Then, 4 mL of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) and FDPP (0.153
g, 0.3975 mmol, 1.5 equiv) were added to the vial, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. DMF was removed
by toluene azeotrope distillation. The residue was partitioned between
1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide (5 mL) and ethyl acetate (5 mL), and
the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 5 mL).
The combined organic layers were washed with 5 mL water and dried
over MgSO4, then concentrated by rotary evaporation.

Analysis of the cyclooligomerization product ratios was effected
by comparing peak areas obtained by analytical RP-HPLC. Crude reaction
mixtures were eluted from an AAPPTec Spirit Peptide C18 column (5
μM, 0.46 cm × 15 cm) using a 60–90% linear gradient
of methanol (solvent B) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA;
solvent A) at 0.75 mL/min. Peaks eluted were detected by absorbance
at 220 and 254 nm, and chromatograms were visualized and peaks from
the 220 nm chromatogram were integrated with EZChrom software. Analytical
chromatograms of both crude and purified compounds are shown in the Supporting Information.

Cyclic products
were purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Compounds
were dissolved in 1.5:1:0.5 ethyl acetate/CH3OH/0.1% aqueous
TFA, then eluted from an AAPPTec Spirit Peptide C18 column (5 μM,
10.0 mm × 25 cm) using a linear gradient of methanol (solvent
B) in 0.1% aqueous TFA (solvent A) at 3 mL/min flow rate. Peaks eluted
were detected by absorbance at 220 and 254 nm, and data were visualized
with EZChrom software. Purified compounds were isolated as powders
following lyophilization.
