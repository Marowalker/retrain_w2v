The important MYC oncogene is deregulated in many
cancer cells and comprises one of the most prominent G-quadruplex
(G4) forming sequences in its promoter regions, the NHE III1 motif. Formation of G4s suppresses MYC transcription
and can be modulated by drug binding, establishing these DNA structures
as promising targets in cancer therapy. The NHE III1 motif
can fold into more than one parallel G4s, including 1:2:1 and 1:6:1
loop length conformers, with the 1:2:1 conformer shown as the major
species under physiological conditions in solution. However, additional
factors such as protein interactions may affect the cellular folding
equilibrium. Nucleolin, a protein shown to bind MYC G4 and repress MYC transcription, is reported herein
to preferably bind to the 1:6:1 loop length conformer suggesting a
physiological significance of this species. The high-resolution NMR
solution structure of the 1:6:1 conformer is determined, which reveals
a 5′-capping structure distinctive from the 1:2:1 form, with
the 6 nt central loop playing an essential role for this specific
capping structure. This suggests that each parallel G-quadruplex likely
adopts unique capping and loop structures determined by the specific
central loop and flanking sequences. The resulting structural information
at the molecular level will help to understand protein recognition
of different G4s, contribution of G4 polymorphism to gene regulation,
and to rationally design small molecules selectively targeting the
1:6:1 MYC G4.

Introduction
G-Quadruplexes (G4)
have emerged as one of the most exciting nucleic
acid secondary structures. These highly diverse structures are formed
by guanosine-rich sequences when four Gs associate in a cyclic array
connected by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, called G-tetrads. Most reported
structures consist of a G-core with three stacked tetrads that coordinate
monovalent cations, that is, potassium or sodium through their carbonyl
groups. The rich variety of conformations is achieved by numerous
combinations of connecting loop structures and enclosing flanking
sequences.1

In recent years, a significant
number of potential G4 forming sequences
were identified throughout the human genome and their existence in cell was shown.2−4 Strikingly, G4 motifs are often
concentrated in promoter regions of highly regulated genes related
to tumorigenesis, suggesting their role in transcriptional control
and making G4s potential drug targets for cancer therapeutics.5

One of the most prominent examples is the
G-rich nuclease hypersensitive
element (NHE III1) within the promoter region of the MYC oncogene.6,7 The encoded MYC protein is an
influential transcription factor affecting cell growth and one of
the most deregulated proteins in cancer cells.8 Repressing MYC transcription on the DNA level by
ligand induced G4 stabilization is a promising strategy because the
protein is short-lived and lacks clear sites for drug recognition.

The G-rich motif within the MYC promoter NHE III1 consists of five consecutive sequences with at least three
Gs that can be assembled into different G4 conformers. Several high-resolution
structures are reported that are all classified as parallel based
on the sugar-phosphate backbone orientation of their G-cores.9−12 Analysis of dimethylsulfate (DMS) foot printing experiments under
physiological conditions revealed the major conformation to have three
propeller loops with respective loop lengths of 1:2:1.7 In addition to the 1:2:1 conformer, the formation of a
1:6:1 species was observed and shown to be thermodynamically favored.
Later, it was identified as parallel topology, however, without reporting
a high-resolution structure.13

The
evolutionary conservation of the long G-rich motif suggests
an advantage in its inherent polymorphism and the resulting competition
between different conformations. Transcription-generated dynamic superhelicity
was shown to be the driving force of gene promoter G4 folding.14−17 In addition, DNA–protein interactions play an important role
in G4-formation and regulation. Protein or small molecule interactions
can shift the folding equilibrium toward a particular structure to
fine-tune gene expression as an additional layer of transcriptional
regulation. The nucleolin protein was found to specifically bind and
stabilize the MYC promoter G4 and functions as transcriptional repressor.18,19 In this study, it is shown that nucleolin prefers the 1:6:1 G4 formed
by the MYC promoter sequence NHE III1 (Figure 1A) over the 1:2:1
conformer, the proposed physiologically major species. The high-resolution
NMR structure of the 1:6:1 G4 was determined and revealed unique structural
features with a 5′-capping triad ATG involving the last residue
of the 6 nt central loop. This information can guide future studies
to understand the fundamentals of G4–protein interactions based
on structural motifs and will help to design small molecules specific
for this 1:6:1 G4 by targeting this unique 5′-capping structure.

Results
Competition EMSA Shows
Nucleolin Preferably Binds the 1:6:1
over the 1:2:1 MYC G4
The 27 nt long oligonucleotide
MycPu27 is often chosen as representation of the G4-forming motif
NHE III1 within the MYC promoter for in
vitro studies (Figure 1B). On the basis of this fragment, sequences can be designed that
adopt only a particular structure while maintaining the specific features
of this conformation in the MycPu27 context. Generally, these are
named based on the position of the G-stretches constituting their
G-core and the last two 3′-terminal Gs are omitted because
their involvement was not shown by DMS foot printing under physiological
conditions.7 The proposed physiologically
major species is Myc2345 (using G-stretches II, III, IV, and V) with
propeller loops of 1:2:1 nt length, which is regularly used in drug
studies to develop small molecules for MYC silencing.11,20 On the other hand, the formation of the longer loop conformer 1:6:1
can be induced by substituting the central loop residues G11–G14
with Ts, removal of the 3′-terminal G overhang, and addition
of flanking Ts yielding the Myc1245_14T sequence. Binding of the nucleolin
protein to both loop conformers was previously reported without direct
comparison.18 Nucleolin is a 77 kDa multidomain
protein, with an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain, a central
core of four RNA-binding domains, and a C-terminal RGG domain. It
was shown that the N-terminal domain does not affect the MYC G4 binding.18 Therefore, an N-terminal
truncated protein was used in the present study.

A competition
EMSA was performed to analyze the binding of nucleolin to the 1:6:1
and 1:2:1 MYC G4s (Figure 1C). The band of radiolabeled Myc1245_14T
is shifted upward upon nucleolin binding as seen in the second lane
of the gel in comparison to the first control lane without protein.
Addition of unlabeled competitor DNA in excess with similar or higher
affinity displaces the labeled Myc1245_14T from nucleolin as shown
by a reduced intensity of the complex band. In lane 3 and 4, the sequences
Myc2345 and Myc1245_14T were added as competitor, respectively, with
only the latter showing a significant attenuation of the upper complex
band. The Myc1245_14T sequence serves as a control because addition
of the identical unlabeled sequence with same affinity increases the
overall receptor pool and decreases the population of nucleolin bound
to radiolabeled DNA. However, Myc2345 binding by nucleolin is clearly
disfavored compared to the longer loop conformer and it cannot displace
Myc1245_14T even at high excess. This is consistent with the reported
preference of nucleolin for G4 with longer loops.21

Therefore, in direct competition, the 1:6:1 sequence
with a longer
central loop is preferably bound by the nucleolin protein and cannot
be displaced by the 1:2:1 conformer, suggesting that protein binding
might shift the in cell folding equilibrium toward
the 1:6:1 conformer Myc1245_14T for the MYC promoter
G4s.

Optimizing the Myc1245 Sequence for NMR Analysis
With
this renewed physiological interest in Myc1245, it is desirable to
learn its structural features at atomic resolution. A 1D NMR spectrum
was recorded for Myc1245_14T to evaluate if the spectral quality was
sufficient for NMR structure determination (Figure 1D). Twelve imino proton resonances are generally
expected for a three tetrad G4 corresponding to the 12 hydrogen bonded
Gs within the core. Clearly, Myc1245_14T adopts only one major conformation;
however, broadening is observed for the G7 and G16 imino protons of
the 5′-tetrad that are in close proximity to the central 6
nt loop. This highly localized effect, not observed for a sequence
missing the terminal T0, suggests the presence of dynamic interactions
involving the mutated central loop and the 5′-terminus.13 In addition, this possibly artificial dynamic
is temperature-dependent and disappears at higher temperatures (Figure 1D).

Single
mutations of the non-native T14 central loop residue closest to the
5′-tetrad were evaluated to overcome this interaction. Two
sequences, Myc1245 and Myc1245_14G with the two purine bases, A and
the native G, respectively, were tested. Indeed, no broadening was
observed for both sequences confirming T14’s involvement in
dynamic interactions in Myc1245. Surprisingly, the imino proton spectra
of Myc1245 and Myc1245_14G are nearly superimposable and resemble
the high temperature spectrum of Myc1245_14T (Figure 1D). This indicates a strong structural similarity
of all sequences and the non-involvement of the position 14 purine
base in a 5′-capping. Ultimately, Myc1245 was chosen as sequence
for NMR structure determination based on the additional base proton
H2 compared to G that can provide more structural information without
altering the structure.

Determining the High-Resolution NMR Structure
of Myc1245
A set of 2D NMR spectra were recorded for Myc1245
including NOESY
experiments at different mixing times and temperatures, a DQF-COSY,
and a 1H–13C HSQC of the aromatic region
(Figures 2, S1, and S2). On the basis of the reported parallel
topology of the G-core, standard assignment strategies following the
sequential contacts were employed (Table S1). Generally, this cross peak pattern is broken by short propeller
loops as seen for the two single nucleotide loops A6 and T19. However,
the central loop residues and the G-core still showed a weaker and
more irregular sequential NOE cross peak pattern with a break a the
A14/A15 step due to the syn conformation of A15 (Table S3). Overall, the determined proton chemical
shifts are very comparable to a previously reported similar sequence.13 In addition, the carbon chemical shifts extracted
from the HSQC corroborated the base proton identities, glycosidic
bond angles, and involvement in hydrogen bond interactions (Figure 2B,C). Most residues
adopt an anti-glycosidic conformation with exception
of the A15 at the 3′-end of the central loop. A strong H8–H1′
NOE cross peak in combination with a deshielding of the C8 compared
to other nonpropeller loop adenines shows a syn orientation
of the base.22 Finally, the DQF-COSY spectrum
confirmed the south sugar pucker for most residues
by comparing H1′–H2′/H1′–H2″
cross peaks and further supported the assignment of thymidine residues
based on observable intraresidue H6–Me resonances.

NMR-derived proton–proton
distances were extracted from
the NOESY experiments at different mixing times and subsequently used
to determine the high-resolution structure of Myc1245 via molecular
dynamics calculations. The final set of 10 lowest energy structures
is well converged with an overall root-mean square deviation (RMSD)
of 1.23 Å and a G-core RMSD of 0.45 Å (Figures 3, S3, and Table 1).

Structure of the Myc1245
1:6:1 G4
The centerpiece of
the 5′-capping is an ATG triad, consisting of A15, T1, and
G2, that connects the central loop and the 5′-flanking. Within
the 6 nt central loop, only the syn conformer A15
stacks upon the 5′-tetrad and is bound by T1 to form a Hoogsteen
hydrogen-bonded T1–A15 base pair (Figure 4A). Thereby, about half of the tetrad including
G16 and G20 is covered. The orientation of this AT base pair is clearly
defined by several NOE cross peaks (Tables S2 and S3). For example, T1’s methyl group shows dipolar
coupling with G16–H1 and G20–H8. Also, A15’s
position is restrained by several interactions of its aromatic protons.
While A15–H8 has NOE cross peaks with G7–H1, A15–H2
interacts with both G7–H1 and G7–H1′. Furthermore,
the T1–A15 base pair layer upon the 5′-tetrad is complemented
by G2 which is stacking on G3, as defined by a G2–H8/G20–H1
cross peak and the standard sequential NOE pattern between the two
adjacent G. Slight broadening of the G2 NOESY resonances may suggest
a more dynamic position as formation of only one hydrogen bond with
the AT base pair is indicated by the proximity of G2’s carbonyl
function and the A15 exocyclic amino group. Finally, T0 is stacked
on top of the ATG triad and located close to the central loop as shown
by NOE interactions between the T0 methyl group and A15’s H2,
H5′, and H5″ protons (Figure 4B and Table S2).

central loop emphasizing its two parts. (E) Top view of the base pair
covering the 3′-tetrad and (F) complete 3′-capping structure.

The central loop of 6 nt connects
the outer tetrads by spanning
the G-core. A single nucleotide is the minimal length of this structural
motif, so the five additional residues can significantly increase
the loop’s conformational flexibility. However, the overall
structure is well converged with an RMSD of 1.23 Å, probably
due to the interaction of A15 with the 5′-flanking. This is
the sole interaction of a loop residue with flanking motifs, and because
A15 is stacked upon the tetrad, the loop is stretched toward the 5′-terminus.
In this way, analogous interactions with the 3′-flanking are
excluded and the adoptable conformational space is limited. Overall,
the solvent exposure of the loop DNA bases is reduced by their positioning
within the groove as hydrophobic dehydration is described as an important
energetic contribution to G4 folding (Figure 4C,D).23 Consequently,
the sugar phosphate backbone is turned outside and electrostatic repulsion
between the negative phosphates of loop and G-core are minimized by
the loop’s central position. With A15 stacked upon the 5′-tetrad,
A14 and T10 are the outer residues of the flexible loop segment and
closest to the G-core. As already indicated by the resemblance of
Myc1245 and Myc1245_14G NMR spectra, A14 is not located above the
5′-tetrad and instead points into the groove. There, it is
in close proximity to T10 based on a T10-Me/A14-H2 NOE cross peak.
Numerous additional dipolar contacts between T10’s H6 or methyl
protons and the core residues G8, G9, G16, and G17 confirm its position
(Table S2). The residues T10 and A14 are
covered by T11 and T12/T13, respectively, with their bases pointing
to opposite directions. This separation of the central loop into two
parts comprising T10–T11 and T12–A14 is also reflected
by the further attenuated NOE cross peak pattern between T11–T12
(Table S3).

In contrast to the 5′-terminus,
the 3′-flanking sequence
does not interact with the central loop and instead forms an internal
capping structure (Figure 4E). The terminal T26 folds back and stacks upon the 3′-tetrad,
forming a reverse wobble base pair with G23 that diagonally spans
the tetrad from G9 to G22. Standard sequential NOE cross peaks observed
between G22 and G23 demonstrate that they are stacked as a continuation
of the G-core (Table S3). On the other
hand, T26’s orientation is unambiguously restrained by dipolar
interactions of its methyl protons to G9–H8 as well as to both
G5 and G9 imino protons. Thus, the T26 sugar points toward the groove
formed by G9 and G18. The two adenosines A24 and A25 link the GT base
pair and show no interaction with the 3′-tetrad (Figure 4F). However, their bases are
oriented toward the G5/G9 site based on weak interactions with T26-Me.

Discussion
The high-resolution structure of the 1:6:1 species
Myc1245 provides
new molecular insights into the structural diversity of MYC G4s. Interestingly, both Myc1245 and the 1:2:1 Myc2345 conformations
have the same 3′-flanking sequence in the genomic context and
will probably share a common capping structure. However, the 5′-capping
motifs differ strongly dependent on the central loop length and thereby
provide distinctive recognition sites for proteins and small molecules.
Most of the 5′-flanking residues within the Myc2345 structure
simply stack upon the tetrad without specific interactions; thus,
the first flanking residue A6 5′ to the G-core is easy to access
and often recruited by end-stacking drugs.20,24 In the case of 1:6:1 Myc1245, a far more complex capping structure
is formed by the interplay of the longer central loop and the 5′-flanking.
Interestingly, this kind of interaction is observed among parallel
G4s with a central loop of at least 3 nt, which are often found in
promoter regions, such as VEGF, hTERT, or c-kit.25−27

The 5′
ATG triad of the 1:6:1 conformer Myc1245 provides
a unique structural profile for ligand recognition compared to the
1:2:1 species. In addition, the higher localization of residues around
the 5′-tetrad allows the constitution of more complex binding
pockets that are often observed for nonparallel structures with lateral
or diagonal loops.28,29

On the basis of the now
gained information about the 1:6:1 MYC G4, future
studies can give insight which structural
motif is decisive for protein recognition of different conformations.
In addition to the unique 5′-capping structure, the negatively
charged, solvent-exposed central loop may facilitate electrostatic
interactions with basic amino acids of a protein. In addition, propeller
loops of at least 3 nt in length show notable flexibility and can
adopt different conformations with small energy penalty.30 For example, loop residues may protrude into
the solvent and can be recognized by proteins as observed for the
nucleolin binding of an RNA hairpin.31 In
the 6 nt central loop of Myc1245, A15 is the naturally occurring residue
and involved in the 5′ ATG capping, while the G11–14
was substituted by TTTA. We carried out MD calculations, which showed
that the wild-type central loop adopts conformations similar to the
mutated sequence.

In conclusion, the high-resolution structure
of the 1:6:1 species
Myc1245 reported herein is an important addition to the ensemble of MYC G4 structures as well as parallel G4s. Nucleolin’s
preference for this conformation over the 1:2:1 loop conformer Myc2345
strongly suggests its physiological significance and might imply how
protein binding can fine-tune gene expression by stabilization of
a particular G4.

Experimental Section
Nucleolin Preparation
The pET-28a (+) vector (Novagen)
was used in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells
(Promega) to express His-tagged recombinant nucleolin protein. Nucleolin
was purified using His-trap, Q-seph and Mono-Q columns. The His-tag
was not removed because EMSA data showed no interference with nucleolin
binding to MYC G4 before and after cleavage.

DNA Sample
Preparation
Oligonucleotides were synthesized
and purified as described previously.32 For NMR samples, the DNA was solved in 90% H2O/10% D2O with 25 mM potassium phosphate and 75 mM potassium chloride
at pH 7 to obtain concentrations between 0.34 and 1.5 mM. The oligonucleotides
were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled slowly to room temperature
for G-quadruplex formation, and quantified based on their UV/vis absorption
at 260 nm.

Competition EMSA
Labeled oligonucleotide
was generated
by incubating the G-quadruplex forming DNA sequence with [γ-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer) and T4 polynucleotide kinase in 1×
phosphonucleotide kinase (PNK) buffer (70 mM Tris·HCl pH = 7.6,
10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C
for 40 min. Each sample was run through a Micro Bio-Spin P-6 gel column
to remove any unreacted ATP based on the recommendations from the
manufacturer (Bio-Rad). G-quadruplex folding reaction was set up in
20 mM Tris HCl and 100 mM KCl at pH 7.5, and samples were incubated
at 95 °C for 5 min and then cooled down slowly to room temperature
on the heating block. Binding of labeled G-quadruplex DNA (2000 cpm)
with 600 nM protein was carried out overnight in 20 mM Tris HCl, 200
mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.15 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 2 mM DTT at
pH 7.4. An excess of cold oligonucleotides was added to the samples
at 1 μM final concentration in 20 μL reactions and incubated
for 2 h. Glycerol (2%) was added to each EMSA reaction immediately
before loading onto a 20 cm × 16 cm × 1.6 mm thick 4% nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE (0.045 M Tris-HCl, 0.045
M boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Protein complexes were resolved
by running the gel at 80 mA for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE
buffer. The EMSA gel was dried using a gel dryer (Bio-Rad, model 583)
and placed in a PhosphorImager cassette. After overnight, exposure
signals were detected using a Storm PhosphorImager.

NMR Experiments
All NMR experiments were performed
on a Bruker Avance-III 800 MHz spectrometer with a QCI cryoprobe at
25 °C and employing a WATERGATE solvent suppression scheme with
a w5 element unless otherwise stated. The spectra were processed with
Topspin 3.5 (Bruker) and analyzed with CcpNmr Analysis.33 NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times
of 80, 150, and 300 ms. Additional NOESY experiments were performed
at 5 and 40 °C with 300 ms mixing time. Both HSQC and DQF-COSY
experiments were executed with a 3–9–19 water suppression
scheme and the HSQC was optimized for a 1J(C,H) of 180 Hz. Chemical shift referencing was done directly for 1H based on the water signal relative to TSP and indirectly
for 13C relative to DSS.

Structure Calculation
NOE-based distance restraints
were obtained by classifying NOESY cross peaks as strong (2.9 ±
1.1 Å), medium (4.0 ± 1.5 Å), weak (5.5 ± 1.5
Å), and very weak (6.0 ± 1.5 Å). Exchangeable protons
were categorized in medium (4.0 ± 1.2 Å), weak (5.0 ±
1.2 Å), and very weak (6.0 ± 1.2 Å). A distance of
5.0 ± 2.0 Å was assigned in case of overlapped and thus
ambiguous resonances. Dihedral restraints were applied for glycosidic
torsion angles with 170°–310° and 200°–280°
for anti-conformers in loop regions and within the
G-core, respectively. The single syn conformer A15
was restricted to 0°–120°. The DQF-COSY spectrum
was used to confirm the south sugar pucker based
on the difference in signal intensity for H1′–H2′
and H1′–H2″ cross peaks. This could not be achieved
with certainty for residues 6, 8, 9, 13, 16, 23, 24, 26 due to spectral
crowding and isochronicity of H2′/H2″ resonances. The
pseudorotation phase angle of all other residues was restricted to
144°–180° for a south-type sugar
during simulated annealing. A distance geometry simulated annealing
protocol was used in Xplor-NIH 2.48 to generate 100 starting structures.34 The sander module of the Amber 16 package was
employed for simulated annealing of the 100 starting structures in
implicit water.35 The OL15 version of the
Amber force field for DNA was used that further modifies the parmbsc0
version.36−38 Structures were initially equilibrated for 5 ps at
100 K and then heated to 1000 K during 10 ps. The system was cooled
down to 100 K during 45 ps after 30 ps of high temperature equilibration.
Finally, a cool down to 0 K was performed in the last 10 ps. The force
constants for NOE-based distance and hydrogen bond restraints were
set to 40 and 50 kcal·mol–1·Å–2, respectively. In addition, G-tetrad planarity restraints
of 30 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 and both glycosidic angle and sugar pucker restraints of 200 kcal·mol–1·rad–2 were applied. Subsequently,
the 20 lowest-energy structures were selected and solvated with TIP3P
water molecules in a truncated octahedral box with a minimal distance
of 10 Å from the DNA to the box border. The system was neutralized
with K+ cations with two of them placed between the tetrads.
For initial equilibration, the DNA position was fixed with 5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 and 500 steps each
of steepest descent and conjugated gradient minimization were performed.
Then, the system was heated from 100 to 300 K in 20 ps under constant
volume, and the force constant on the DNA was slowly decreased going
from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 during steps of each 10 ps. The final production
run of 4 ns used the pmemd module of Amber 16 under constant pressure,
and a snapshot was taken every picosecond. Only NMR-derived distance
and hydrogen bond restraints were employed with a force constant of
25 kcal·mol–1·Å–2. Finally, the last 500 ps of the trajectories were averaged and
energy-minimized for 500 steps in vacuum, and the 10 lowest energy
structures were selected for the final ensemble. Structures were analyzed
and visualized with PyMOL and the VMD software.39,40
