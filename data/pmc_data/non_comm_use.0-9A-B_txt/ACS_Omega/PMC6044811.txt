Analog series were systematically
extracted from more than 650 000
bioactive compounds originating from medicinal chemistry and screening
sources and more than 3.6 million commercial compounds that were not
biologically annotated. Then, analog series-based (ASB) scaffolds
were generated. For each scaffold from a bioactive series, a target
profile was derived and ASB scaffolds shared by bioactive and commercial
compounds were determined. On the basis of our analysis, large segments
of commercial chemical space were not yet explored biologically. Shared
ASB scaffolds established structural relationships between bioactive
and commercial chemical space, and the target profiles of these scaffolds
were transferred to commercially available analogs of active compounds.
This made it possible to derive target hypotheses for more than 37 000
compounds without biological annotations covering more than 1000 different
targets. For many molecules, alternative target assignments were available.
Target hypotheses for these compounds should be of interest, for example,
for hit expansion, acquisition of compounds to design or further extend
focused libraries for drug discovery, or testing of expanded analog
series on different targets. They can also be used to search for analogs
and complement compound series during target-directed optimization.
Therefore, all of the commercial molecules with new target hypotheses
as well as key scaffolds identified in our analysis and their target
profiles are made freely available.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Volumes of publicly available
bioactive compounds and other small
molecules increase rapidly, as exemplified by three major databases
that collect bioactive compounds from different sources and small
molecules from chemistry vendors. For example, release 22 of ChEMBL,1 the major public repository of active compounds
from the medicinal chemistry literature and patents contains nearly
1.7 million compounds with activity against more than 11 000
targets. In addition, PubChem,2 the major
public resource of screening data, lists more than 93 million compound
entries and 1.25 million assays. Taken together, these two major databases
contain more compounds and activity data than could have been imagined
just a few years ago. Moreover, release 15 of ZINC,3 which collects compounds from chemistry vendors worldwide,
reports an astonishing number of more than 200 million entries. Thus,
in terms of compounds, structures, and activity data, chemistry is
without doubt entering the “big data” era.4 ZINC compounds are not biologically annotated
but represent a vast sample of chemical space that is relevant for
drug discovery. Accordingly, the large numbers of bioactive compounds
and vendor molecules that are available provide an unprecedented opportunity
to systematically compare structural relationships between active
compounds and other small molecules that are currently without biological
annotations and attempt to derive target hypotheses for molecules
that are available commercially. Therefore, we have carried out a
large-scale comparison of compound subsets selected from ChEMBL and
PubChem on the basis of well-defined activity criteria and target
annotations and ZINC molecules that are most likely available from
vendor sources. The analysis was facilitated using the recently introduced
concept of analog series-based (ASB) scaffolds.5 Different from other scaffold definitions,6 the ASB scaffold formalism first systematically extracts
analog series from compound collections and then isolates conserved
core structures from series that distinguish between analogs on the
basis of a single substitution site (if available).5 Thus, ASB scaffolds carry series information and account
for structural relationships. Furthermore, ASB scaffolds can be annotated
with targets of compounds they represent. Biologically annotated ASB
scaffolds can then be used to develop target hypotheses for other
compounds containing the same scaffold. This approach was recently
successfully applied to target deconvolution of chemical cancer cell
line screens.7

Herein, we report
our systematic comparison of bioactive and commercial
compounds and derivation of target hypotheses for nonannotated molecules.
The large number of target hypotheses that were obtained, frequently
including multiple assignments for compounds, should be of interest
for a variety of practical applications as discussed below.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Compounds and Activity
Data
Commercially
available compounds were collected from ZINC version 15 (accessed
March 5, 2017).3 To narrow down commercial
chemical space and focus our analysis on compounds desirable for medicinal
chemistry, the druglike subset was selected from ZINC using the “tranche
browser”. Reactivity was set to “anodyne” (i.e.,
compounds that do not contain problematic functionalities, also excluding
pan-assay interference compounds2) and
availability to “in-stock” (i.e., ready for delivery).
The resulting compound subset was downloaded in two dimensional SMILES
format and standardized with inhouse Python scripts implemented in
OpenEye chemistry toolkit.9 These selection
procedures resulted in set of 3 658 425 unique compounds
from ZINC.

Bioactive compounds were assembled from ChEMBL1 version 22 and the current release of PubChem
BioAssays.2 From ChEMBL, only compounds
with high-confidence activity data were considered. Therefore, compounds
involved in direct interactions (target relationship type “D”)
with human targets at the highest confidence level (target confidence
score 9) were selected. As potency measurements, only assay-independent
equilibrium constants (Ki values) and
assay-dependent IC50 values were considered. Approximate
measurements associated with “>”, “<”,
or “∼” were discarded. If multiple Ki or IC50 values were available for the same
compound, the geometric mean of the values was calculated as the final
potency annotation, provided all of the values fell within the same
order of magnitude. Otherwise, the measurements were discarded. Given
these selection criteria, a total of 224 532 unique compounds
were obtained with activity against 1687 human targets.

From
PubChem BioAssays, a subset of 426 294 unique compounds
tested both in primary assays (percentage of inhibition from a single
dose) and confirmatory assays (dose–response assays yielding
IC50 values) was selected.10 Only compounds classified as active or inactive were taken, whereas
compounds with designations such as unspecified or inconclusive were
discarded. From primary assays, RNA interference screens were removed,
whereas all of the chemical screens were retained, including cell-based
assays for which no individual target was specified. For confirmatory
assays, a series of selection criteria was applied with the aim to
collect chemical compounds tested against single target proteins,10 yielding a total of 299 021 unique compounds
with activity against 772 targets.

2.2 Scaffold
Analysis
ASB scaffolds were
identified following a previously described two-stage procedure.5 First, the analog series was identified by applying
the matched molecular pair (MMP) formalism.8 An MMP is defined as a pair of compounds that differ only by a structural
change (chemical transformation) at a single site.11 Thus, an MMP consists of a shared core and a pair of exchanged
substituents. Specifically, MMPs were generated using an adaptation
of Hussain and Rea method,12 which systematically
fragments molecules at exocyclic single bonds. Instead of random fragmentation,
we applied retrosynthetic combinatorial analysis procedure (RECAP)
fragmentation rules,13 according to which,
exchanged fragments conformed with chemical reactions, yielding RECAP-MMPs.14 Transformations in RECAP-MMPs were confined
to limited size because previously established fragment size restrictions15 were applied to limit RECAP-MMPs to pairs of
compounds representing typical analogs. Specifically, the size of
the conserved RECAP-MMP core was required to be at least twice the
size of the larger exchanged fragment that was allowed to consist
of at most 13 heavy atoms.15 These size
restrictions ensured that substituents were limited to maximally a
condensed two-ring system with no more than three additional atoms
conforming with largest substitutions typically seen in the analog
series from medicinal chemistry.

Second, a network was generated
in which the nodes represented compounds and edges pairwise RECAP-MMP
relationships. In this network, each separate cluster represented
a unique series of analogs16 from which
ASB scaffolds were extracted.5 Hence, ASB
scaffold generation combines analog search and scaffold extraction
algorithms. Because analog series often contained multiple possible
RECAP-MMP cores, a computational search was carried out for a core
that captured all of the MMP relationships within the series. If more
than one core met this criterion, the largest one was selected. The
qualifying RECAP-MMP core represented the ASB scaffold of the series.5 ASB scaffold analysis and compound statistics
are summarized in Table 1. All of the calculations were carried out using inhouse Perl and
Python scripts with the aid of the OpenEye chemistry toolkit and KNIME
protocols.9,17

2.3 Target
Annotations
A pool of unique
1687 targets originating from selected ChEMBL compounds and 772 targets
from selected PubChem compounds was used to develop plausible target
hypotheses for commercially available ZINC molecules. For each analog
series, the union of target annotations from bioactive compounds comprising
the series was determined and assigned to ZINC molecules sharing the
corresponding ASB scaffold. To identify unique targets and assign
targets to families, the UniProt classification scheme was applied.18 Therefore, target GI numbers from PubChem and
IDs from ChEMBL were mapped to UniProt IDs, hence ensuring consistency
of target annotations.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 ASB Scaffold Analysis
ASB scaffolds
were systematically extracted from the analog series originating from
224 532 ChEMBL compounds for which high-confidence activity
data and target annotations were available, 426 294 most extensively
assayed PubChem compounds, and 3 658 425 ZINC molecules
that had the highest probability of commercial availability. As reported
in Table 1, for each
database, around 60% of the compounds participated in the formation
of analog series. ZINC, ChEMBL, and PubChem compounds yielded 264 496,
22 015, and 42 513 series, respectively, from which
ASB scaffolds were isolated. Figure 1 shows the size distribution of analog series. In each
case, more than 60% percent of all of the series were compound pairs,
an additional 23–27% of the series consisted of 3–5
compounds, and less than 10% of 6–10. Thus, whereas some very
large series were extracted from each database (Table 1), small series dominated the distribution.
From more than 70% (ChEMBL, PubChem) to close to 80% (ZINC) of all
analog series, ASB scaffolds were obtained. ZINC, ChEMBL, and PubChem
series yielded 208 004, 15 625, and 31 602 ASB
scaffolds, respectively, which represented in total about a 3rd of
the initially selected compounds (Table 1). ASB scaffold statistics from ChEMBL were
consistent with the previous findings reported by Stumpfe et al.19 It is noted that ASB scaffolds from ChEMBL exclusively
represented active compounds, whereas scaffolds from PubChem represented
both active and consistently inactive screening compounds. Scaffolds
from ZINC represented compounds without activity annotations. Importantly,
the comparison revealed that ZINC contained many more analog series
and ASB scaffolds than were available for bioactive compounds. In
addition, more than 40% of the ZINC compounds did not participate
in series. Taken together, these observations indicate that ZINC covers
large chemical space that is most likely not yet explored biologically.

Figure 1 Distribution
of compounds over series. Shown is the distribution
of compounds over analog series with ASB scaffolds. Percentages give
the proportion of series with 2 (blue), 3–5 (purple), 6–10
(green), and 11 or more (orange) compounds. In each case, the largest
proportion of series were compound pairs.

3.2 Scaffold Overlap
Next, the overlap
between the independently derived ASB scaffold populations was determined.
The results are shown in Figure 2. ChEMBL and ZINC shared 1216 ASB scaffolds, whereas
PubChem and ZINC shared 11 270 scaffolds. For PubChem, only
ASB scaffolds representing multiple active compounds were taken into
consideration (inactive compounds were omitted). The intersection
between all of the 3 scaffold populations contained 581 scaffolds.
On the basis of shared ASB scaffolds, structural relationships between
bioactive and ZINC compounds were established. As reported in Figure 2, 2608 and 32 962
ZINC compounds shared ASB scaffolds and analog relationships with
1705 ChEMBL and 17 001 PubChem compounds, respectively. The
581 ASB scaffolds that were shared by all of the 3 scaffold populations
represented 292 ChEMBL, 1230 PubChem, and 2193 ZINC compounds.

Figure 2 Overlap between
ASB scaffolds from different sources. The Venn
diagram reports the overlap of ASB scaffolds derived from ChEMBL 22,
PubChem, and ZINC. The number of shared ASB scaffolds and corresponding
compounds is reported. ZINC compounds were associated with the union
of unique target annotations from bioactive compounds represented
by the shared ASB scaffold. For ASB scaffolds shared by ChEMBL and
PubChem, unique targets were determined.

3.3 Target Transfer
Targets of a series
of bioactive compounds sharing the same ASB scaffold were assembled
and assigned to the scaffold. The union of unique targets then constituted
the target profile of the scaffold, representing a form of metadata.
ZINC molecules sharing the same scaffold were analogs of bioactive
compounds from which the target profile was derived. Accordingly,
a shared ASB scaffold established a direct structural link between
compounds with and without target annotations, and its target profile
provided the target hypotheses for molecules from ZINC. Underlying
ideas included that structural analogs are likely to display similar
or overlapping biological activities, and that ASB scaffolds can be
used for activity assignments at a higher level of structural abstraction
compared to individual analogs comprising a series. Activity assignments
to scaffolds are often attempted in compound-based scaffold analysis.6 However, ASB scaffolds are more suitable for
metalevel activity assignments on the basis of analogs comprising
a series than compound-based scaffolds.5Figure 2 shows 3
exclusive subsets of 1216, 11 270, and 581 ASB scaffolds representing
compounds from ChEMBL and ZINC, PubChem and ZINC, and all of the 3
databases, respectively. ChEMBL and PubChem compounds sharing ASB
scaffolds with ZINC molecules were active against a total of 543 and
586 unique targets, respectively. Thus, despite the availability of
many more PubChem than CHEMBL compounds sharing ASB scaffolds with
ZINC molecules, the target coverage of these compound sets was comparable.
In addition, compounds from ChEMBL and PubChem represented by the
581 ASB scaffolds shared by all of the 3 databases were active against
a total of 600 targets. In total, by combining these exclusive sets,
588 and 610 targets from ChEMBL and PubChem were obtained, which could
be assigned to 37 763 ZINC compounds. The distribution of these
targets over different families is shown in Figure 3a for ChEMBL and Figure 3b for PubChem. Although the distributions
were partly similar, there were notable differences. For example,
compounds from ChEMBL covered larger proportions of kinases and proteases
than PubChem compounds, whereas PubChem covered a larger proportion
of targets that did not belong to major therapeutically relevant families
(“other targets”). The 581 ASB scaffolds that were common
to ChEMBL, PubChem, and ZINC represented the compounds active against
a large number of targets, thus assigning a key role to these conserved
ASB scaffolds.

Figure 3 Distribution of targets over different families. The distribution
of targets over different families assigned to ZINC compounds on the
basis (a) ChEMBL and (b) PubChem annotations is shown. UniProt-based
target family assignments were available for 549 of 610 PubChem targets.

3.4 Promiscuity
of Shared Scaffolds
On
the basis of target profiles, the promiscuity of scaffolds was determined,
also representing an analysis at the level of metadata (i.e., scaffold
promiscuity was inferred from unique targets of compounds represented
by a given ASB scaffold). Table 2 reports the distribution of the 1216 and 11 270
ASB scaffolds and the corresponding compounds from ChEMBL and PubChem
over increasing numbers of targets (i.e., increasing promiscuity levels).
The majority of ASB scaffolds shared by ChEMBL and ZINC compounds
(i.e., 863) were only annotated with a single target. Hence, these
scaffolds were classified as nonpromiscuous. In addition, there were
more than 300 scaffolds with 2–4 targets available and smaller
numbers with up to 25 targets (promiscuous scaffolds). In addition,
for 3091 ASB scaffolds shared by PubChem and ZINC, only a single target
was available. However, in this case, there were 4494 scaffolds with
2–4, 754 with 5, and 1822 scaffolds with 6–10 targets.
Furthermore, more than 1100 ASB scaffolds with 11–25 or more
targets were available. Thus, ASB scaffolds shared by PubChem and
ZINC compounds were overall much more promiscuous than those shared
by ChEMBL and ZINC.

3.5 Target
Hypotheses
For a total of
37 763 commercial ZINC molecules, target hypotheses were derived
on the basis of shared ASB scaffolds, covering a total of 1051 unique
targets. Figure 4 shows
the representative examples. Figure 4a shows a series comprising eight analogs from ChEMBL
that were active against varying numbers of seven different targets.
On the basis of the shared ASB scaffold, this series was combined
with a corresponding series from ZINC containing six analogs, hence
yielding a total of seven target hypotheses for these ZINC molecules.
In addition, in Figure 4b, a series of six PubChem analogs is shown. Each of these compounds
was active against one of three targets. Five analogs from ZINC were
found to contain the same ASB scaffold, thus providing three target
hypotheses for these molecules. Furthermore, Figure 4c shows 5 PubChem and 4 ChEMBL analogs containing
1 of the 581 conserved ASB scaffolds found in all of the 3 databases.
ChEMBL and PubChem analogs were active against a total of five different
targets. The conserved ASB scaffold was also present in six ZINC molecules.
Thus, for these analogs from ZINC, five plausible target hypotheses
were available.

Figure 4 Analog series and shared ASB scaffolds. Shown is exemplary
analog
series with shared ASB scaffolds for (a) ChEMBL (blue box), (b) PubChem
(green), (c) ChEMBL and PubChem, and ZINC compounds (orange) in an
R-group table format. Substituents (R1) in analogs are
in red. For each series, the union of targets (assigned targets) from
bioactive compounds is provided that can be potentially assigned to
ZINC compounds containing the same scaffold. In (a) eight analogs
from ChEMBL that share an ASB scaffold with six analogs from ZINC
are shown that are active against a total of seven targets including
protein-tyrosine phosphatase LC-PTP (T1), induced myeloid leukemia
cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (T2), carboxy-terminal domain RNA
polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 1 (T3), nuclear receptor
subfamily 4 group A member 1 (T4), protein tyrosine kinase 2 β
(T5), estrogen receptor β (T6), and apoptotic protease-activating
factor 1 (T7). In (b), six analogs from PubChem that share an ASB
scaffold with five analogs from ZINC are shown that are active against
a total of three targets including TDP1 protein (T1), thioredoxin
glutathione reductase (T2), and dopamine receptor D3 (T3). In (c),
5 PubChem, 4 ChEMBL, and 6 ZINC analogs containing 1 of the 581 conserved
ASB scaffolds are shown. PubChem and ChEMBL analogs were active against
a total of five unique targets including dopamine D1 receptor (T1),
TDP1 protein (T2), adenosine 5′-triphosphate-dependent Clp
protease proteolytic subunit (T3), serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor (T4),
and urea transporter 1 (T5).

Because more than 37 000 biologically unannotated
compounds
were linked to activities against more than 1000 targets via the ASB
scaffold approach, often including multiple target hypotheses ASB
scaffolds and resulting compounds, several practical applications
can be considered. For example, these compounds provide a pool for
target-directed hit expansion (“analog-by-catalog”)
and for the design or extension of focused libraries used in drug
discovery. To these ends, it is often attempted to acquire new compounds
from vendor sources. Taken together, the results of your analysis
assign priorities to commercial compounds for many targets. Furthermore,
analog series are often evaluated on closely related targets in the
search for selective compounds. For this purpose, analog series can
also be further extended with commercial compounds linked to activities
of interest. On the other hand, ZINC compounds containing promiscuous
ASB scaffolds, as described above, can also be selected as candidates
for exploring multitarget activities, another current topic of interest
in drug discovery research. Thus, the pool of commercial compounds
with analog relationships to known bioactives should have utility
for a variety of applications.

4 Conclusions
Our study was designed to systematically compare bioactive and
commercial chemical space on the basis of analog series, establish
structural links via ASB scaffolds, and develop target hypotheses
for commercial molecules. To these ends, a total of more than 4.2
million carefully selected compounds were analyzed. For ASB scaffolds,
target profiles were generated on the basis of active compounds they
represented, and scaffolds shared by bioactive compounds were determined.
A subset of 581 conserved ASB scaffolds was identified whose profiles
covered 600 different targets. The scaffolds played a central role
in target exploration and transfer across different databases. Shared
scaffolds and their target profiles made it possible to derive target
hypotheses for 37 763 compounds from ZINC having a high probability
of commercial availability. These compounds represent interesting
candidates for acquisition and focused library design or other applications
in compound optimization, as discussed above. Therefore, as a part
of our study, key ASB scaffolds and ZINC compounds with new target
annotations will be made freely available on an open access platform.20
