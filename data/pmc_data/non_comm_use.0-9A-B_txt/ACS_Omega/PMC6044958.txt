In this study, an
effective and simple direct printing
method was developed to create sensing devices on screen-printed carbon
electrodes (SPCEs) to detect multiple species simultaneously. Two
sensing materials, graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), were printed on one SPCE for detection of multiple
biochemical substances. Printed layers of the GONRs and PEDOT:PSS
mixture (GONRs & PEDOT:PSS) on SPCE showed embedment of GONRs
in the PEDOT:PSS layer and diminished the electrochemical activity
of GONRs. In contrast, by printing the GONRs and PEDOT:PSS at separate
locations (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) on the same SPCE, the electrochemical
activities of both GONRs and PEDOT:PSS can be preserved. Thus, without
synthesizing new materials, the modified electrode is able to simultaneously
detect ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA), and nitrite
(NO2–), with high anodic oxidation currents
and well-separated voltammetric peaks, in differential pulse voltammetry
measurements. The detection limits for the four analytes are 41 nM
(AA), 30 nM (DA), 11 nM (UA), and 18 nM (NO2–), respectively. The electrode can either detect single species separately
or simultaneously determine specific concentrations of the four species
in aqueous mixtures, and this can be further extended for many other
electrochemical sensing applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The recent demands on health care require fast and efficient diagnosis
or screening of biochemical substances to manage chronic illnesses.
In the human body, there are plenty of biochemical substances and
thus simultaneous detection or monitoring of these substances is crucial
to disease screening. For example, ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA),
uric acid (UA), and nitrite (NO2–) regularly
coexist in many biological matrices and thus were considered as important
molecules in human physiological processes. AA is a vital component
in human diet and plays an important role in tissue repair.1 DA is a common neurotransmitter in many mammalian
central nervous systems and is responsible for the functions of central
nervous, renal, and hormonal systems.2−4 UA is another important
biomolecule in body fluids and is associated with several diseases,
such as gout, hyperuricaemia, and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome.5,6 NO2– in physiological systems is associated
with NO, a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator in the central nervous
system. Because NO can be oxidized easily to NO2– in biological circumstances, as fast as in a few seconds,7−11 NO2– is also a commonly found substance
in the human body. The balance of coexisting UA, AA, DA, and NO2– in the human body is an important index
for physiological functions, and thus a sensitive biosensor to simultaneously
detect these four molecules with accurate concentration determination
is highly desirable for analytical or diagnostic applications.

Electrochemical techniques are the most commonly used approach
to quantitatively detect DA, AA, UA, or NO2– with great accuracy. However, simultaneous detection to these four
molecules in the same mixture solution has been a challenge in this
research field. Because the oxidation potentials of DA, AA, UA, and
NO2– are very close, selective determinations
of these four molecules are technically difficult for bare electrodes.
The recent development in sensing material synthesis has shown the
possibility to detect these four molecules at the same time with chemically
modified electrodes. The most commonly used sensing material is functionalized
carbon nanotube (CNT). For example, Yang et al. functionalize multiwalled
CNTs (MWCNTs) with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and show that
the functionalized MWCNT can yield simultaneous electrochemical determination
for AA, UA, DA, and NO2–.12 Similarly, after being adsorbed on MWCNT, metal
ions, such as lanthanum(III)13,14 or iron(III)15 have also been reported to simultaneously detect
these four molecules electrochemically with great accuracy. Besides
functionalized CNT, gold nanoparticles can also show similar electrochemical
capability on a surface-modified glassy carbon electrode.16

Although the above materials are capable
of simultaneously determining
DA, AA, UA, and NO2– mixtures, the synthetic
steps to formulate new sensing materials are highly challenging. It
is of great interest for scientists or engineers to prepare electrodes
by combining several known sensing materials on one electrode for
simultaneous determination of DA, AA, UA, and NO2– mixtures. In previous studies,17,18 graphene oxide
nanoribbons (GONRs) can selectively detect AA, DA, and UA in aqueous
mixtures. For NO2–, recent research shows
that poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has a superior electrocatalytic
property toward NO2– and can be used
to determine NO2– concentration quantitatively.19,20 Among various types of PEDOT derivatives, PEDOT:polystyrene sulfonate
(PSS) has not only great conductivity but also good electrochemical
characteristics for sensing. Intuitively, the mixture of PEDOT:PSS
and GONRs might show a combined or synergetic capability to selectively
detect DA, AA, UA, and NO2–. To codeposit
two materials on an electrode, electrochemical methods are regularly
used. However, due to the physical limitations, these methods can
only yield layered electrodes without patterns. Recently, printing
sensing materials over chemically inert electrodes have been reported
to provide an alternative sensor preparation.21 These printing methods not only can deposit materials with accurate
amounts but can also deliver inks to specific locations with patterns.
It would be of scientific interest to utilize these printing methods
to deposit GONRs and PEDOT derivatives and investigate the combinatorial
effects of these two sensing materials for simultaneous detection
of DA, AA, UA, and NO2–.

In this
study, an effective and simple direct printing method will
be developed to deposit GONRs and PEDOT derivatives on the same screen-printed
carbon electrodes (SPCEs) to create a combinatorial sensor for UA,
AA, DA, and NO2–. The electrochemical
behaviors of electrode surfaces modified with either mixed or separate
sensing materials will be carefully examined to understand the mutual
influence between these two materials. The ability of the prepared
combinatorial electrodes for simultaneous detection of multiple biofactors
will also be inspected to investigate the feasibility of combining
multiple sensing materials together as one versatile sensor.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Characterization
and Surface Morphology
of Printed Sensors
After the microwave process, MWCNTs are
unzipped into GONR. Transmission electron microscopy images of MWCNT
and GONR before and after the unzipping process are illustrated in Figure 1a,b. As shown in Figure 1b, graphene sheet
structures are found on both sides of the nanotube, whereas the central
core of the nanotube remains slightly dark and tubelike. This type
of core–shell heterostructure is termed as a MWCNT/GONR nanomaterial,
which is consistent with the morphology of the GONRs reported previously.17 The unzipped GONRs can be stably dispersed in
water (Figure S2) and are used in the following
dispensing step.

Figure 1 Transmission electron microscope images of (a) as-received
MWCNTs
and (b) individual GONRs; scanning electron microscopy images of (c)
pristine SPCE, (d) PEDOT:PSS-modified SPCE, (e) GONRs-modified SPCE,
and (f) (GONRs & PEDOT:PSS) mixture-modified SPCE; (g) picture
of the SPCE; (h) optical microscope image of SPCE modified with (GONRs
+ PEDOT:PSS).

The SPCEs can be modified
with specific materials and/or designed
patterns. All optical microscope images are shown in Figure S1. The original SPCE has a rough surface (Figure 1c), with large carbon
grains of several microns in size. After being modified with PEDOT:PSS
(Figure 1d), the surface
is covered with plastic polymers and becomes smooth. Similarly, after
printing over the circular electrode, GONRs also uniformly spread
over the SPCE surface (Figure 1e). The GONR dispersion is compatible with PEDOT:PSS solution
(Figure S2), and their aqueous mixture
is also used to modify the SPCE. In Figure 1f, one can observe that GONRs are embedded
in the PEDOT:PSS polymer thin film, and thus the electrochemical reactivity
of GONRs might be reduced due to the less exposed area to analyte
solutions.

The optical image of an electrode with (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS)
printed
in separate (concentric) areas is shown in Figure 1h: the circle is modified with GONRs and
the outer annulus is modified with PEDOT:PSS. With the digital printing
procedure, one can control the concentric radius (0.106 cm in this
case) so that the annulus area (0.0352 cm2) is nearly the
same as the circular area (0.0355 cm2). Through this printing
method, one can simply control the material deposit areas so that
the two sensing materials can be separated on the SPCE to avoid direct
physical or chemical interferences. However, the electrochemical interferences,
which involve electron transfer near the modified SPCE surfaces, might
still exist because the two substances are still on the same SPCE.
Fortunately, GONRs and PEDOT:PSS are both anodic sensing material
so that there are insignificant electrochemical reactions around the
overlapping concentric boundary, as will be shown below.

2.2 Electrochemical Performances of the Prepared
Electrodes
The electrochemical responses of the aforementioned
surface-modified electrodes to various biochemical substances are
examined via cyclic voltammetry (CV). Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of these
electrodes for 1 mM AA, UA, DA, and NO2–, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. All
electrodes show no electrochemical responses in PBS solution. The
GONRs have a good ability to detect AA, UA, and DA (Figure 2a), which agrees with the detection
capability of GONRs reported previously,17,18 but exhibit little response to NO2–. On the other hand, PEDOT:PSS shows preferentially high peak currents
for DA and NO2– (Figure 2b) but shows relatively low peak currents
for AA and UA. Besides, PEDOT:PSS shows electrochemical properties
for NO2– sensing similar to those in
the literature.19,20

Figure 2 Cyclic voltammograms of (a) GONRs, (b)
PEDOT:PSS, (c) (GONRs &
PEDOT:PSS) mixture, and (d) (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrodes produced
when sensing 1 mM AA, UA, DA, and NO2–. The scan rate is 50 mV s–1.

The coexistence of these two sensing materials on SPCE can
simultaneously
help to detect all acids at the same time with specific electrochemical
signals. First, the GONRs and PEDOT:PSS are mixed together and printed
on the SPCE. Figure 2c shows the cyclic voltammograms of the (GONRs & PEDOT:PSS) mixture
on SPCE. The results confirm that the (GONRs & PEDOT:PSS) mixture
can detect all bioacids. However, the peak current for AA is reduced,
compared to that of bare GONRs. Because the amounts of GONRs on both
electrodes are the same, the poor electrochemical response to AA might
be a result of embedded GONRs in the PEDOT:PSS polymer (cf. Figure 1f) after drying.
In a previous study,18 it was concluded
that the dangling bonds on the edges of the GONRs are responsible
for the enhanced electrochemical sensing after the unzipping process.
But in the mixture, GONRs are embedded in PEDOT:PSS with little exposed
areas to the test fluids and thus lead to low responses to AA, which
can only be detected by GONRs. To avoid this problem, same amounts
of GONRs and PEDOT:PSS are printed in separate areas on the same electrode
(Figure 1h). The cyclic
voltammograms of this (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode exhibit high oxidation
peak currents for all four testing substances (Figure 2d). Moreover, the peak currents of this (GONRs
+ PEDOT:PSS) electrode are nearly the same as the superposition of
peak currents from individual GONRs and PEDOT:PSS electrodes in Figure 2a,b, indicating that
PEDOT:PSS and GONRs in different areas can express their individual
detecting abilities without interfering with each other.

2.3 Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) for Simultaneous
Detection
DPV is performed to test the ability for simultaneous
detection of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode for AA, UA, DA, and
NO2–. First, the DPV curves (Figure 3a) show that the
(GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode can clearly distinguish these four substances
separately. All peaks are separate by at least 100 mV. When
all test substances are mixed in the same PBS solution, the (GONRs
+ PEDOT:PSS) electrode can still detect these four substances clearly
(Figure 3b). The voltammetric
peaks have nearly the same voltage positions as of those in CV, with
separations for AA–DA, DA–UA, and UA–NO2– of 220.5, 115.1, and 405.9 mV, respectively.
These separations between the voltammetric peaks are clear enough
to distinguish these four substances.

Figure 3 (a) DPV curves of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS)
electrode in 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7.0) solutions containing AA, DA, UA, and NO2–, respectively. All analytes have the same concentration of 1 mM.
(b) The DPV curve of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode in 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7.0) solution containing 1 mM AA, 0.033 mM DA, 0.33 mM UA, and
0.33 mM NO2–.

The (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode also shows great sensitivity
for each individual substance in the mixture. Figure 4 shows the DPV curves of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS)
electrode in a mixture solution containing AA, DA, UA, and NO2–. When one increases the concentration
of DA (Figure 4b),
the peak current at 220 mV increases. There are two regions for the
oxidation current (IDA) versus the DA
concentration (CDA) (Figure 4f). In the low concentration
region of DA, the linear regression equation is IDA = 5.02 + 0.82CDA, with
a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9906.
In the high concentration region, the linear regression yields a relationship
of IDA = 67.25 + 0.16CDA, with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9901 (Table S2). The
existence of two slopes may be explained by monolayer adsorption followed
by multilayer adsorption, as reported previously in the literature,22 and the lower sensitivity in the high concentration
region could be attributed to limited active sites of GONRs and PEDOT:PSS.
Similar behavior of the two sensitive regions are also observed for
UA (Figure 4g) and
NO2– (Figure 4h). In particular, AA has only one region
from 250 to 1500 μM (Figure 4e), possibly because the second region is located in
higher concentrations. Besides, the oxidation currents also show linear
responses for those substances when the concentrations of AA, DA,
UA, and NO2– increase at the same time
(Figure S4). The electrochemical responses
of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrodes are quite stable. As shown in Figure S3, the same sensor was tested five times
for repeatability (Figure S3a), and five
sensors were tested to ensure the reproducibility (Figure S3b). Table S1 summarizes
the normalized standard deviations of peak currents in Figure S3 and indicates that when the electrode
is submerged in an aqueous mixture containing all four substances,
good repeatability and reproducibility (<5%) can be obtained in
DPV tests to steadily provide distinguishable peaks for AA, DA, UA,
and NO2–. We also check the application
in urine samples. The urine sample was diluted to 100 times with 0.1
M PBS (pH 7.0) before measurements. The recoveries ranged between
96 and 109.2% (Table S3), showing that
the proposed method could be effectively used in a real sample for
determination of AA, DA, UA, and NO2–.

7.0) with the AA/DA/UA/NO2– mixture:

mM NO2–, (c) 0.5 mM AA + 0.0025 mM DA
+ 0.0005–0.2 mM UA + 0.5 mM NO2–, and (d) 0.5 mM AA + 0.005 mM DA + 0.1 mM UA + 0.001–2.5
mM NO2–. (e) The oxidation current of

2.4 Amperometric
Responses
The (GONRs
+ PETDOT:PSS) electrode can also yield in fairly good sensitivity
and detection limits for AA, DA, UA, and NO2–. The amperometric responses of the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode
to AA, DA, UA, and NO2– are depicted
in Figure 5, and the
results are summarized in Table 1. All oxidation currents show great linearity to specific
analyte concentrations at fixed potentials. For AA (Figure 5a,e), the linear regression
equation is given by IAA = 0.0016 + 0.1002CAA, with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9991. With a signal-to-noise ratio of
3, the detection limit of AA using the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode
is found to be 41 nM (Table 1). Similar results are also observed for UA, DA, and NO2–. All detection limits of AA, UA, and DA
using the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode are similar to that of the
previous data for GONR.17 The performances
of the printed (GONRs + PEDTO:PSS) sensor have a similar or even better
detection limit for AA, DA, UA, and NO2– compared to the literature (Table S4).
These results indicate that the GONR and PEDOT:PSS in separate areas
on the (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) electrode retain their own electrochemical
activities, and the overlapping boundaries have little effects on
the electrochemical detection.

PEDOT:PSS) electrode after

substances: (e) AA, (f) DA, (g) UA, and (h) NO2–.

3 Conclusions
An effective
and simple printing method is developed to prepare
electrodes with two sensing materials for simultaneous detection of
multiple species. GONRs and PEDOT:PSS are deposited on the same SPCE
to simultaneously detect multiple biochemical substances. Direct deposition
of the GONRs/PEDOT:PSS mixture on SPCEs leads to embedment of GONRs
in the PEDOT:PSS layer and diminishes the electrochemical activity
of GONRs. By printing the two materials with accurate amounts on separate
areas of the same electrode, the electrochemical activities of both
GONRs and PEDOT:PSS are preserved. Thus, without synthesizing new
materials, the modified electrodes are able to simultaneously detect
AA, DA, UA, and NO2–, with high anodic
oxidation currents and well-separated voltammetric peaks in DPV measurements.
The corresponding peak separations were 220.5 mV (AA–DA), 115.1
mV (DA–UA), and 405.9 mV (UA–NO2–). The detection limits for the four analytes are 41, 30, 11, and
18 nM, respectively, in amperometric current–time measurements.
The electrode can either detect single species separately or determine
the specific concentrations of aqueous mixtures of the four species.
This new combinatorial approach for surface modification can act as
a novel platform for simultaneous detection of multiple substances
and can be further extended for many other electrochemical sensing
applications.

4 Experiments
4.1 Chemicals
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and potassium permanganate
(KMnO4) were obtained from
J.T. Baker. MWCNTs (product name, NCT tube) were purchased from Mitsui
& Co., Ltd. AA, UA, DA, nitrite acid, and Nafion (5 wt % aqueous
solution) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEDOT:PSS (Clevies, PH1000,
the solid content is 1.0 wt % (in water) and the PEDOT:PSS ratio is
1:2.5) was purchased from Heraeus Co., Ltd.

4.2 Microwave-Assisted
Synthesis of GONRs
The experimental procedure for the synthesis
of GONRs has been reported
in detail in our previous study.17 Briefly,
0.05 g of MWCNTs was suspended in a 9:1 (v/v) H2SO4/H3PO4 mixture and treated in a microwave
reactor for 2 min, then addition of KMnO4 (0.25 g) was
made to the solutions. Finally, the reaction mixture was treated in
a microwave reactor for 8 min and filtered through a membrane (pore
size 0.1 μm; Millipore). The resulting solid products were washed
with water and then dried in an oven at 100 °C for an hour.

4.3 Preparation of GONR Ink and Modified Electrodes
by Printing Technology
GONR ink was prepared by mixing 6
mg of GONR powders, 2 mL of ethanol, 3 mL of deionized water, and
60 μL of Nafion. The mixture was then sonicated to form a stable
suspension. The (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) ink was a mixture of the GONRs
ink and PEDOT ink, with a 1:1 volume ratio.

The printing system
mainly consists of a desktop robot (DT-200F; Dispenser Tech Co., Ltd.)
and a pneumatic controller (9000E; Dispenser Tech Co., Ltd.). A nozzle
with an inner diameter of 0.06 mm (34G), with a 5 mL syringe, was
used to print the inks over the SPCE.

4.4 Instrumentation
The morphologies
of modified electrodes were investigated by using a scanning electron
microscope (Nova NanoSEM 230). Transmission electron microscope (Hitachi
H-7100) was used to characterize sample morphologies.

4.5 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
experiments were carried out using a CHI 6271E electrochemical workstation
(CHI). A three-electrode system was used with a standard silver/silver
chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode as the reference electrode. The modified
electrode served as the working electrode with a platinum wire as
the counter electrode in the electrochemical experiments. In this
study, all potentials were reported with respect to the Ag/AgCl electrode.
AA, UA, DA, and NO2– were added to an
electrochemical cell containing PBS (pH = 7.0), with 0.1 M KCl at
room temperature.
