Herein, we present
a facile method for deoxygenative hydroboration
of a broad range of carboxylic acids under very mild conditions. The
most striking feature of this attractive hydroboration is that this
elusive and challenging transformation was realized without catalyst
and solvent. The investigation of solvent effect showed that tetrahydrofuran
was also suitable for this kind of reaction. Moreover, a successful
gram-scale trial may provide a very promising toolkit for carboxylic
acid reduction at a large scale.

Introduction
Alcohols are basic
building blocks in organic synthesis because
of their versatile reactivity for the generation of a wide range of
products for fine chemical, agrichemical, and pharmaceutical industries.1 Reduction of carboxylic acids into corresponding
alcohols is a straightforward procedure. Traditionally, two classical
reduction methods utilizing stoichiometric quantities of strong metal
hydride/borane agents and pressurized hydrogen gas have been developed.2−4 Although metal hydrides/boranes are common and reliable, safe handling
of highly reactive or even pyrophoric agents would be a major concern.
Moreover, the disposal of large amounts of waste stream may pose a
cumbersome environment problem.2a,2b Hydrogen gas reduction
represents an atom-efficient procedure. However, intrinsic extreme
flammability of hydrogen gas, the harsh requirement of special high-pressure
and high-temperature withstanding equipment, and the lack of reactivity
toward certain substrates prohibit its widespread application.4a−4c In this regard, to develop a more convenient alternative protocol
for the reduction of biomass-abundant carboxylic acids into alcohols
is of significant importance for the valorization of carbon feedstock.

Carbonyl hydroboration is a key and prevalent transformation in
organic chemistry because it offers a useful functional group manipulation
method to obtain corresponding alcohols via hydrolysis from boric
esters in both academic and industrial perspectives. During the past
years, a lot of progress has been made in carbonyl hydroboration involving
aldehydes and ketones by employing a variety of catalysts including
main group elements,5−11 transition metals,12−22 and lanthanide complexes.23,24 Interestingly, catalyst-
and solvent-free methodologies for the hydroboration of aldehydes
were reported by Hreczycho’s group recently.25 Among these well-developed hydroboration manifolds, it
is not difficult to find that the research concerning the hydroboration
of carboxylic acids is seriously lagging behind that related to carbonyl
counterparts. Only a few examples have been covered to date.26,27 Very recently, Gunanathan and co-workers reported an efficient deoxygenative
hydroboration of carboxylic acids catalyzed by a ruthenium complex
for both aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids under neat conditions.26 Later, Leitner’s and Maji’s groups
reported that manganese complexes could enable the reduction of a
wide range of carboxylic acids with low catalyst loadings under mild
conditions, respectively.27 Almost at the
same time, our group archived a very interesting patent discovery
regarding the deoxygenative hydroboration of carboxylic acids under
catalyst- and solvent-free conditions.28 Soon, in the course of preparation of this work, we noticed that
Panda’s team also documented similar findings.29 On the one hand, in the continuation of our group’s
work on the hydroboration of various unsaturated carbonyl, imine,
and alkyne compounds,8d,24,30 on the other hand, to further broaden the substrate scope of our
carboxylic acid hydroboration patent and exploring the potential scalability
in commercial scale, we would like to present this work for the direct
hydroboration of pinacolborane (HBpin) toward carboxylic acids without
catalyst under very mild conditions.

Results and Discussion
We began our investigation by adopting HBpin and benzoic acid as
modular substrates. 1H NMR was used to monitor the reaction
progress and representative results are displayed in Table 1. Initially, we were gratified
that 85% deoxygenative hydroboration product was obtained with a molar
ration of 1:3 (benzoic acid/HBpin) in catalyst- and solvent-free manners
in 4 h at ambient temperature (Table 1, entry 1). A 95% hydroboration conversion was exclusively
achieved by slightly elevating HBpin to 3.3 equiv (entry 2). Inspired
by this thrilling observation, we further found that either increasing
HBpin to 5 equiv (entry 4) or prolonging the reaction time to 6 h
with 3.3 equiv HBpin (entry 5) leads to complete quantitative hydroboration
transformation. Obviously, a slight excess of HBpin could result in
a faster and more efficient conversion of benzoic acid into borate
benzoate. This trend is consistent with the finding of catalyst-free
hydroboration of benzaldehyde.25 Additionally,
a contrast experiment was carried out by adding 1 mol % trimethylamine
into the above-mentioned reaction conditions (entry 6). No evident
improvement on the conversion indicated that the Lewis base had no
obvious catalytic promotion on benzoic acid hydroboration, which excluded
the possible role of trace stabilizers in HBpin. Considering the possibility
that high temperature is not conducive for benzoic acid hydroboration
transformation, several trials were carried out at different temperatures
under neat conditions. The experimental results showed that the conversion
increased with the increase of temperature (entries 8–10),
and the yield can reach 92% at 60 °C in 2 h (entry 10). This
outcome supersedes what literature has in stock.26 Finally, we investigated the solvent effect on this reaction
by using various common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran
(THF), Tol, hex, and dioxane (entries 11–14). The solvent screening
results showed that THF demonstrated superior reactivity than any
other selected solvents (entry 11). The reactivity in THF is a little
higher than that of the solvent-free trial (entries 2 and 11). It
is understandable and acceptable that hydroboration in appropriate
solvent, for example, THF, may provide an option reaction upon pilot
especially at an industrial scale. There are two pronounced advantages
under suitable solvent conditions: homogeneous reaction and mitigation
of safety concern in neat reaction.31 Further,
a very detailed investigation by using dioxane as a solvent was examined
for inspecting the possible toxic effect of solvent on this reaction.
Interestingly, the reactivity in dioxane dropped down sharply when
increasing the solvent amount (entries 15–18). Noticeably,
trace amount of desired product was detected once 500 μL dioxane
was added to the reaction mixture. On the basis of above laboratory
trials and in consideration of the green chemistry principle, the
optimized reaction condition was defined as a reactant molar ration
of 1:3.3 and solvent-free under ambient temperature. To facilitate
the complete transformation of the subsequent substrates selected
below, the reaction time for most aromatic carboxylic acid substrates
was set at 12 h in conformity with entry 7 in Table 1.

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, the applicability
of this promising transformation with a broad range of carboxylic
acids was exploited. Typical results are listed in Table 2. We are delighted that all
selected commercially available aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic
acids have been successfully transformed into targeted deoxgenative
hydroboration products with satisfactory to excellent yields based
on 1H NMR analysis. As shown in Table 2, under solvent-free condition, either the
carboxylic acids with electron-withdrawing group, p-F, o-Br, p-I, and m-Br (1b–1f), or electron-donating
group, p-tBu, p-OEt,
and o-OMe (1g–1i), could afford quantitative yields of borate esters at ambient temperature
in 12 h. Inspiringly, the catalyst- and solvent-free systems showcased
good tolerability with functionalized carboxylic acids. For example, m-NO2 and p-CN benzoic acids
accomplished 98 and 81% yields, respectively (1j and 1k). Remarkably, 1-naphthoic acid also achieved a full conversion
(1l). It is worth pointing out that no hydroboration
product was detected for 6-Br-2-naphthoic acid; nevertheless, 99%
conversion was obtained by adjusting the temperature to 60 °C
(1m). This phenomenon may be attributed to the higher
reaction activity of the α position than that of the β
position of the naphthalene cycle. Subsequently, we shifted our interest
to aliphatic carboxylic acids, as this transformation is of enormous
potential for the valorization of nonfossil feedstocks. In general,
the hydroboration of aliphatic acids is more challenging than those
of aromatic acids.27a In our catalyst-
and solvent-free systems, all selected low- to medium-chain aliphatic
carboxylic acids underwent smooth hydroboration conversion, demonstrating
a competent capability of aliphatic carboxylic acids to be reduced
to pertinent alkyl borate esters (1p–1y). Noticeably, hydroboration of aliphatic acids was more effective
as shortened reaction periods were evidenced. For example, within
1 h, 97% conversion was finished for acetic acid (1t).
Octadecanoic acid, a biologically available long-chain fatty acid,
could offer quantitative conversion within 6 h (1y).
It is presumed that the more excellent performance of the aliphatic
acids in comparison to those of aromatics may be due to the better
solubility of aliphatic acids, which provides the space for reaction
homogeneity. Remarkably, formic acid gave 99% yield under room temperature
within 6 h, showing a much higher reactivity in comparison with the
29% yield in the reported system.27a Diacids
such as o-carboxyphenylacetic and adipic acids also
achieved satisfactory outcomes (1n and 1o). Apart from the reported substrates by Panda and co-workers,29 a further broad range of substrates were proven
to be applicable for this transformation, affirming that this catalyst-free
approach is suitable for carboxylic acid substrates with structural
diversity.

As mentioned before,
the resultant borates could be derivatized
into alcohols via hydrolysis. A handful of representative boric esters
were selected to undergo hydrolysis to afford the corresponding alcohols.
As expected, all boric esters presented in Table 3 were successfully hydrolyzed with satisfactory
yields of related primary alcohols.

Table 3 Hydrolysis of Boric
Esters to Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: carboxylic
acid (1.0 mmol) and HBpin (3.3 mmol) were stirred at rt for 12 h;
isolated yields and products were purified by column chromatography.

Furthermore, intermolecular
chemical selectivity by using benzoic
acid and methyl benzoate or benzyl benzoate was explored (Scheme 1). Under our current
reaction conditions, the reaction exhibited exclusive chemical selectivity
toward carboxylic acid with the yield of 99%, whereas methyl benzoate
or benzyl benzoate remained intact.

Scheme 1 Chemoselective Hydroboration
of Carboxylic Acid with Esters
In our kinetics studies, the empirical rate law for carboxylic
acid hydroboration was monitored and determined by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Representative first-order linear plots were found in
[carboxylic acid] and [HBpin] (eq 1). Details of kinetics are displayed in the Supporting
Information (Figure S6A,B). 1  In addition, a gram-scale experiment was performed
under the same solvent-free condition. Interestingly, at a molar ratio
of 15 (benzoic acid)/49.5 (HBpin) in 12 h, nearly a quantitative hydroboration
product was obtained (Scheme 2). This demonstration may provide a promising pathway for
the hydroboration of carboxylic acids at a large scale.

Except
the mechanism of this catalyst-free system described in
the literature,29 we proposed another possible
reaction pathway according to the reported
documents.25−27 As shown in Scheme 3, a Lewis adduct could be formed in the course of the
reaction. An aldehyde intermediate was generated accompanied by boron
ether releasing, and the subsequent process was similar to that of
the known literature.25 A thorough experimental
demonstration of the mechanism study and more interesting findings
related to hydroboration transformation are being undertaken in our
laboratory.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have disclosed catalyst- and solvent-free protocols
for the deoxgenative hydroboration under very mild conditions. This
transformation with high efficiency has been realized with a wide
range of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Excellent chemical
selectivity and good functional group tolerance were also achieved.
A gram-scale trial proved the feasibility and scalability of this
protocol without compromising the reaction conversion rate.

Experimental
Section
General Methods
All reactions were carried out in a
glovebox under nitrogen atmosphere. Hexane, THF, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane
were dried by heating to reflux over sodium benzophenone ketyl and
then distilled under nitrogen prior to use. Chemicals were purchased
from Acros, Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa-Aesar, and Spectrochem, and used without
further purification. Mesitylene was used for the clarification of
product yield. The progress of reactions was monitored by Bruker AV-400
(1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 101 MHz) using CDCl3 as the solvent.

General Procedure for Catalytic Hydroboration
of Carboxylic
Acids
In the glovebox, carboxylic acid (0.5 mmol) and pinacolborane
(1.65 mmol) were added in a reaction vial with a magnetic bead. The
reaction mixture was allowed to run at room temperature for 1–12
h. Then, the reaction was removed from the glovebox and mesitylene
(0.5 mmol) was added as an internal standard. The reaction mixture
was subjected to 1H NMR spectroscopy to confirm the yield
in alkyl boric ester.

General Procedure for Hydrolysis of Boric
Esters to Alcohols
Upon completion of the reaction, the resulted
boric ester residue
was refluxed with silica gel (1g) and methanol for 6 h. Then, the
aliquot is evaporated under vacuum and extracted with dichloromethane.
The combined organic layers were dried, evaporated, and purified by
column chromatography over silica gel (100–200 mesh) using
ethyl acetate/hexane (1:5) mixture as an eluent to obtain pure primary
alcohols (2a–g).
