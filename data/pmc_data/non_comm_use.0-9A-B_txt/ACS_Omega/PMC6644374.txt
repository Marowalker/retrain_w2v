The
present work focuses on the challenges that emerge in connection
with the kinetics of mechanically activated transformations. This
is an important topics to comprehend to enable the full exploitation
of mechanical processing in a broad spectrum of areas related to chemistry
and materials science and engineering. Emerging challenges involve
a number of facets regarding materials and material properties, working
principles of ball mills and milling conditions, and local changes
occurring in series in processed materials. Within this context, it
is highly desirable to relate the nature and rate of observed mechanochemical
transformations to individual collisions and then to the processes
induced by mechanical stresses on the molecular scale. Hence, it is
necessary to characterize the milling regimes that can establish in
ball mills regarding frequency and energy of collisions, map the relationship
between milling dynamics and transformation kinetics, and obtain mechanistic
information through proper time-resolved investigations in
situ. A few specific hints are provided in this respect.

1 Introduction
The
mechanical force of the ball milling (BM) technique is traditionally
utilized in powder metallurgy and mineral processing to mix granular
matter, reduce particle size, refine microstructure, and promote chemical
reactivity.1−4 The unit operation is based on the transfer of mechanical energy
to powders during the collisions between milling tools that occur
inside the reactor of a ball mill. Processes on the mesoscopic and
microscopic scales occur impulsively in the volumes of powder mixture,
which are trapped either between the colliding balls or between a
ball and the reactor wall. The resulting mechanical deformation of
powder particles can give rise to cold-welding and fracturing as well
as to physical and chemical transformations.1−4

The nature and extent of
local processes activated by individual
collisions strictly depend on the nature of the processed powder.
For instance, the BM of individual metals promotes the formation of
a fine microstructure comprising crystalline grains with characteristic
lengths between 5 and 50 nm.5−8 Chemical effects associated with microstructural
refinement emerge in the powder mixtures of elemental metals, where
forced mixing on the atomic scale can result in the mechanical alloying
of constituents.1−4 Similarly, physical and chemical effects can be associated with
the adequate mixing of molecular components which emerge in inorganic
and organic synthesis9−11 as well as in other areas of chemical and engineering
research and technology. In this respect, crystal engineering represents
a good example. Indeed, the use of mechanochemical methods has given
further stimulus to the manufacturing of pharmaceutical co-crystals,12−14 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),15 and deep-eutectic solvents.15

The
increasing number of applications of mechanical activation
to the synthesis of chemicals and the preparation of materials has
recently driven a new, rapid surge of interest. As a consequence,
the study of mechanically activated transformations is, presently,
one of the most rapidly growing subjects in organic and materials
chemistry. Yet, various menacing issues discourage attempts to transfer
technology from the laboratory to industry. Milling dynamics has been
characterized only in a few cases, and the kinetics and thermodynamics
of mechanochemical transformations are still poorly understood.1−4,16,17

Within this context, in the present work we bring to the attention
of researchers a few important facts: (1) Control of processing conditions
is a necessary requisite to perform accurate kinetic studies. (2)
The development of kinetic models is needed to relate experimental
evidence to conversion processes involving much smaller time and length
scales. (3) Direct information on such processes can be obtained by in situ, possibly time-resolved studies.

2 Characterization of Processing Conditions
Ball mills involve
simple working principles. The entire reactor,
or part of it, undergoes periodic motion aimed at inducing collisions
of the balls inside the reactor with each other and with the reactor
walls.1−4,18 The colliding surfaces of the
milling media trap powder particles in between and subject them to
mechanical loading. Non-hydrostatic mechanical stresses arise at every
contact point between any pair of powder particles. Local collisional
and frictional processes of variable intensity and duration take place
at such locations.19,20 Their occurrence, as well as
their relative importance and intensity, depend on the milling conditions
selected and the specific mechanical action of the ball mill.1−4

Working principles customarily allow ball mills to be divided
into
the two broad classes of mixers and attritors.4 In mixers, balls collide at relatively high velocity, and impulsive
dynamics dominates. In attritors, relatively low collision energy
mostly results in frictional dynamics. However, it is worth noting
that the modification of processing parameters makes it possible to
move smoothly between the two milling regimes. Therefore, no rigid
distinction between the two classes should be made.

Numerous
factors affect processing conditions.4 These
include the mass of powder inside the reactor, the
number and size of balls, the frequency of collisions and their energy,
the temperature, the atmosphere inside the reactor, and the process
control agents utilized to avoid or limit particle agglomeration.
The effects of processing parameters on milling regimes have not yet
systematically mapped.1,21−24 However, the fragmentary information
available from the literature indicates the powder charge, the number
and size of balls, the frequency, and the energy of collisions as
the most critical factors affecting the kinetics of mechanically activated
transformations.25−40

Detailed characterization of the milling dynamics has been
performed
only for the SPEX Mixer/Mill 8000 and the Fritsch Pulverisette devices,
respectively—the two most popular shaker and planetary mills.
The SPEX Mixer/Mill 8000 allows processing powder charges of up to
30 mL. The reactor moves as schematically depicted in Figure 1, undergoing angular harmonic
displacement in the vertical plane simultaneously with rotation in
the equatorial plane. It typically works at a frequency of 14.6 Hz.
The frequency range between 12.5 and 30.0 Hz8,41 has
been explored using a device equipped with a three-phase asynchronous
motor controlled by a frequency converter.29,30

Figure 1 Schematic
description of the reactor motion.

A methodology combining experimental and modeling studies
allow
characterizing the milling dynamics.29,30,41 Collision frequency and energy can be accurately
evaluated in the presence of both a single milling ball and a significant
amount of powder using piezoelectric and magnetic sensors and high-speed
video recording.29,30,41 Two collisions per cycle take place, indicating that the ball alternately
collides with the opposite reactor bases following relatively regular
trajectories due to the energy dissipation during collisions.

In the absence of powder, and with a reactor frequency of about
18.3 Hz, a single milling ball 14 mm in diameter exhibits average
collision frequency equal to about 89.3 Hz and a broad distribution
of ball velocity with an average around 10.42 m s–1. As powder charge is increased, collisions move from perfectly elastic
to perfectly inelastic regimes. Accordingly, the average collision
frequency on the reactor bases drops from 89.3 to 36.6 Hz, whereas
the collision velocity on the reactor base decreases smoothly from
6 to 3 m s–1.42 In the
case of perfectly inelastic collisions, the ball slides along the
cylindrical wall, and collisions occur exclusively on the reactor
bases. Two collisions per cycle take place, and the average collision
velocity is equal to about 5.1 m s–1. Collision
velocity and milling frequency exhibit an approximately linear relationship.

The methodology mentioned above displays its whole potential when
the mechanical treatment is performed with a single milling ball.
However, numerical integration methods can be used to gain insight
into milling regimes establishing in the presence of two or more balls.42,43

Information on the milling dynamics, although fragmentary,
has
also been given for planetary mills, which exhibit mechanical action
and working conditions quite different from those arising in a shaker
mill. These milling devices consist of one or more reactors lying
in an eccentric position on a support disk. The disk and reactor rotate
around their own axes in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 2. The two centrifugal
forces generated by the synchronous rotations give rise to a net force
that undergoes a periodic variation during the mill working cycle.
Within a wide interval of rotation speeds, such force first makes
the ball roll on the reactor wall, then pushes it across the reactor
chamber, and finally determines its collision with the reactor wall. Figure 2 also shows the typical
ball trajectory inside the moving reactor.

Figure 2 Schematic description
of a planetary mill. The support disk rotates
at an angular frequency ωd, whereas the reactors,
at distance R from the disk center, rotate in the
opposite direction at an angular frequency ωr. The
typical trajectory of a ball inside the reactor is shown in the vertical
projection in the top right position.

Fritsch GmbH and Retsch GmbH produce the most popular planetary
ball mills. The Fritsch Pulverisette P5 and P6 models are equipped
with vials and balls made of different materials and cover capacities
between 12 and 500 mL. High-speed planetary ball mills were manufactured
to reach rotational speeds up to 1100 rpm, which result in centrifugal
accelerations up to almost 100 times Earth’s gravity.

The milling dynamics of planetary mills is also susceptible to
characterization using the experimental method developed for the SPEX
Mixer/Mill 8000. However, no attempt has been made in such direction
to date. Thus, most available information comes from numerical simulations
and strictly phenomenological empirical evidence. Numerical simulations
suggest that the amount of mechanical energy that can be transferred
to the powder during a collision depends on the velocity of the ball
and on the angle of contact between the colliding milling media.18,21−24,26,27,44 Indirect evidence has been noted from the
study of physical and chemical transformations that point out that
the transformation rate, and the nature of transformation itself,
depend on the milling frequency and the mass and number of balls,
thus indicating a role of collision energy.18,21−24,26,27,44 Numerous studies have been performed to
estimate such quantities from the numerical description of the milling
dynamics.28,36,37,40 To such aim, different combinations of milling parameters,
including ball number and size, powder charge, and rotation speeds
of disk and reactor, have been considered.31,34,35 Numerical findings suggest that individual
balls typically collide with energy between 0.01 and 0.65 J, and that
collisions involving energies between 0.50 and 0.65 J occur at a frequency
between 12 and 30 Hz, depending on the processing conditions. Correspondingly,
the specific power dissipated during collisions can span the interval
from approximately 2.5 to 22.5 J g–1 s–1.31,34,35,38,39

The Uni-Ball
Mill, which mainly finds application in the preparation
of nanostructured materials and alloys, also deserves mention.45,46 In the Uni-Ball Mill, the ball motion is confined to the vertical
plane and is controlled by the configuration of external permanent
magnets. This setup allows the coexistence of shearing and impact
operation modes. The impact velocity can reach to 1.5 m s–1. Collision frequency in the impact mode ranges from 1 to 2 Hz. Calculations
based on Hertz impact theory suggest maximum impact stress of 37 kbar.45

For other ball mills, essentially no information
is available.
Therefore, it would be highly desirable to deepen the insight into
their milling dynamics in the light of the usefulness of such devices
for preparing chemicals and materials as well as for monitoring mechanically
activated transformations.

This is the case, for instance, of
the recently developed planetary
milling system shown in Figure 3, which has been developed by Automaxion SARL. It uses adapters
to hold multiple vials instead of normal jars, thus allowing the simultaneous
processing of various samples. It has also been used to reduce the
particle size of diverse materials down to 0.1 μm, to disperse
pigments for inks and coatings,47 and to
screen co-crystals for minimal quantities of drugs.48,49 It has also been utilized for the “parallel synthesis”
of 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine
derivatives, thus showing the convenience of processing simultaneously
up to 48 samples.50

The eccentric position of vials and the combined rotation
of jar
and support disk, evident from Figure 3D, impart the milling ball a net force different from
the one typically experienced by balls in a conventional planetary
mill, depicted in Figure 3E. Therefore, characterizing the milling dynamics is of primary
importance for the suitable control of experimental conditions.50,51

Analogous considerations hold for the Retsch MM200 and MM400
Mixer
Mills, which can work with 2–50 mL samples at frequencies between
3 and 30 Hz, and the compact benchtop mill FTS1000 released by FormTechSci,
with a comparable range of grinding frequency and a mechanical action
described in Figure 4a. Such operational features allow, depending on the powder charge,
a variation of the impact velocity of milling balls against the reactor
walls approximately between 0.1 and 7 m s–1, with
collision frequencies as high as 60 Hz. Similarly, characterization
of milling dynamics is highly desirable for the Fritsch Mini-Mill
Pulverisette 23 shown in Figure 4b, which imparts a spherical grinding bowl containing
0.1–5 mL samples vertical oscillations at frequencies between
15 and 50 Hz.

The need of a complete
characterization of milling conditions appears
even more urgent in the case of the milling equipment dedicated to
the in situ monitoring of mechanically activated
transformations (Figure 5) using synchrotron X-ray diffraction52 and time-resolved Raman spectroscopy,53 also in tandem.54

A modified Retsch Mixer mill MM200,
shown in Figure 5a,
was used for the quantitative in situ powder X-ray
diffraction analysis of a mechanochemical
process.52,55 Later on, In Solido Technologies manufactured
the mixer mill IST600 shown in Figure 5b. It is equipped with a plug-and-play in situ monitoring system, evident from Figure 5c, enabling synchrotron X-ray diffraction
and Raman spectroscopy. Allocating up to four jars with a volume between
1 and 250 mL, the mill works at frequencies ranging between 3 and
33 Hz. When equipped with a ThermoJar system, the in situ measurement of local temperatures under milling conditions is also
possible. Very recently, a new experimental setup for the study of
milling reactions in real-time was released. It consists of an in situ triple coupling associating the simultaneous recording
of X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectra, and thermograms to correlate
structural evolution with temperature information during milling.56

3 Kinetic Modeling
The availability of detailed information on the relationship between
milling dynamics and the nature and rate of physical and chemical
transformations, and the real-time in situ measurement
of physical properties, show the promise of leading mechanochemistry
to a crucial turning point.4,27,57−61 In particular, the enhanced accuracy in evaluating transformation
kinetics can be expected to facilitate progress connected with the
fundamental aspects of mechanical activation. In fact, it can give
considerable help in the development of kinetic models aimed at linking
empirical observation to local microscopic processes taking place
during individual collisions.

In this respect, a relatively
simple, phenomenological modeling
approach can be derived starting from the fundamental features of
the mechanical processing by BM. This latter is characterized by the
continual stirring of the powder charge, which then keeps a high degree
of chemical uniformity during the entire mechanical processing. The
trapping of powder between the colliding milling media is approximately
stochastic, and only a small volume V* of the trapped
powder is effectively processed during each collision, i.e., subjected
to critical loading conditions (CLCs) severe enough to activate a
given transformation. It follows that the powder charge can be divided
into volume fractions k = V*/V, where V is the total volume of powder,
which have the same probability of being effectively processed during
a collision.

As discussed in detail in our previous study,62 statistical analysis of the BM process indicates
that,
for k ≪ 1, the variation of the volume fractions
of powder effectively processed 0 and i times, with
the number of collisions n, is approximately described
by the expressions 1   2  which satisfy the mass balance
condition ∑i=0∞χi(n) = 1.

Equations 1 and 2 can be used to
describe the kinetics of mechanically
induced transformations. For instance, the mass fraction of material
transformed can be expressed as 3  under the hypothesis
that transformation already
occurs when the material is subjected to CLCs once, and further involvement
in collisions has no consequence. Along the same line, if the material
transforms only after two CLCs, the mass fraction of material transformed
can be expressed as 4  The model is quite versatile and allows the
definition of a set of equations able, in principle, to best fit experimental
kinetic curves.

Similarly, eqs 1 and 2 can also be used to describe
the microstructural
evolution of a given phase. For instance, it can be assumed that the
powder fraction subjected to i CLCs has average crystallite
size Li. Therefore, the
average crystallite size L that can be obtained by
averaging over the total powder charge is equal to 5  where L0, L1, L2, ... Li are
the average crystallite
sizes of the powder fractions that have undergone CLCs 0, 1, 2, ... i times, respectively. Quite often, experimental evidence
indicates that the crystallite size of any given fraction of powder
submitted to CLCs drops from the initial L0 value to the final Lf one after a single
CLC event. Under such circumstances, L0 ≠ L1 = L2 ... = Li ...
= Lf, and eq 5 can be rewritten as 6  Similar expressions can be
written starting from eq 5 and specializing Li values.

According to eqs 1–6, the rate of a mechanically
activated
transformation depends on the quantity k. The larger
its value, the faster the transformation is. Therefore, k can be regarded as the apparent rate constant of the transformation.
Since mechanically activated transformations do not necessarily involve
chemical reaction, k does not necessarily correspond
to rate constants typically defined in chemical kinetics. Nevertheless,
it can be considered a chemical rate constant whenever the mechanically
activated transformation involves a chemical reaction.

In its
broadest definition, k measures the volume V* of powder where the mechanically activated transformation
occurs. The volume V* is not a continuum. Instead, it is the sum of smaller volumes that can be thought to
be irregularly distributed within the volume of powder subjected to
mechanical loading during individual collisions. In turn, such smaller
volumes can be regarded as the volumes within which the local mechanical
stresses generated during the collision induce the transformation.

Therefore, k represents merely an estimate of
the amount of pristine material involved in the mechanically activated
transformation. Since no information is available on the mechanism
governing the transformation, and no assumption is made in such regard,
it cannot be excluded that the overall rate of transformation depends
on two or more stages. Therefore, following in this classical chemical
kinetics, it is more appropriate to look at k as
an apparent rate constant.

Although the model is phenomenological,
and therefore k is a phenomenological constant, a
better understanding of its physical
meaning is strictly necessary to foster further progress in the modeling
description of the transformation kinetics. In this respect, existing
literature focusing on the development of a kinetic approach for mechanochemical
transformations based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics can be quite
useful.63 However, significant work must
be still performed to allow the coherent development of a conceptual
framework for providing a rigorous interpretation of the thermodynamic
and kinetic features connected with the rate constant of mechanically
activated processes. Hopefully, this specific subject will become
an active and popular area of research.

All the model equations
developed heretofore hold validity if expressed
as a function of time, t. Time and number of collisions
are related by the product n = Nt, where N is the frequency of collisions. Therefore, kn = kNt = Kt, where K = kN is the apparent rate constant referred
to the time scale. K expresses merely the volume
of powder subjected to CLCs per unit time.

In the following,
a few specific examples will be discussed to
show the capability of the model for interpolating experimental points.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Kinetic Evidence
Literature is relatively
lacking in reports including experimental curves describing transformation
kinetics quantitatively. Despite the considerable attention devoted
in the past to mechanical activation, only in a few cases have the
formation of inorganic phases from a set of reactants, the phase transition
from one polymorph to the other, and the reaction between two or more
chemicals been satisfactorily investigated in this respect. In most
cases, only qualitative and indirect kinetic and mechanistic inferences
have been gathered starting from empirical observation.

The
kinetic analysis of refined experimental data sets, even with a simple
kinetic model such as the one described above, can provide interesting
information on the way mechanical activation by BM works. A few case
studies, spanning from individual metals to mixtures of organic compounds,
are discussed.

4.1.1 Formation of Nanostructures
Mechanical
activation has been extensively used to induce the reduction of grain
size, L, in pristine crystalline materials. For some
metals, minerals, and ceramics processed individually and in the mixture, L varies with the number of collisions, n, as can be seen in Figure 6. It undergoes a smooth monotonic decrease from an initial
value, L0, to a final asymptotic one, Lf. L0 is not a meaningful
quantity, being mostly determined by the process employed to produce
the commercial powders. Conversely, Lf depends on both material properties and processing conditions.64

Figure 6 Average crystallite size L of Cu as a
function
of the number of collisions, n. The best-fitted curve
is also shown.

As evident from Figure 6, eq 6 satisfactorily
reproduces the experimental behavior. This suggests that the assumptions
underlying the mathematical expression, namely the fact that the grain
size in a volume subjected to CLCs once changes discontinuously from
the initial value, L0, to the final one, Lf, can represent a physical situation. According
to the best fitting, the apparent rate constant, k, is approximately equal to 3.2 × 10–6. Based
on the model interpretation of k, this value expresses
the ratio V*/V between the volume V* of trapped powder effectively processed during each collision
and the total volume V of powder. If the density
of effectively processed powder does not differ from that of the pristine
powder, k is also equal to m*/m. Here, m* is the mass of powder effectively
processed during each collision, and m is the total
mass of powder inside the reactor. Since the data shown in Figure 6 were obtained from
experiments using a total mass of Cu of 8 g, the amount of powder
effectively processed during any individual collision, i.e., subjected
to a decrease of the grain size consequent to the mechanical stresses
generated by the colliding milling tools, is equal to about 24 μg.

4.1.2 Reactivity of Solids
Previous work
has shown that BM induces the formation of radical species at the
surface of quartz powder subjected to BM.65 Radical generation was monitored using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) in ethanol solution as radical scavenger.65 UV–vis spectrophotometric analyses indicate a consumption
of DPPH due to the interaction of DPPH with the hydrogen radicals,
H•, formed in solution by reaction of the C2H5OH molecules with the silyl, ≡Si•, and siloxyl, ≡Si–O•, radicals at
the surface of quartz powders. The reaction scheme can be summarized
as indicated below:65 a   b   c   d  The mechanical activation first determines
the formation of surface radicals ≡Si• and
≡Si–O•. The radicals then react with
ethanol molecules to form H•. Finally, H• combines with the DPPH to form neutralized DPPH-H.

The number NDPPH of moles of DPPH in ethanol solution is
shown in Figure 7a
as a function of the number of collisions, n, undergone
by quartz. NDPPH decreases smoothly at
a rate that becomes increasingly lower as n increases.
After about 2 × 106 collisions, the NDPPH decrease becomes linear.

Figure 7 (a) Number of moles of
DPPH in ethanol solution, NDPPH, and (b)
average specific surface area of quartz
powders, S, as a function of the number of collisions, n. Best-fitted curves are also shown.

The NDPPH data in Figure 7a can be related to the values
of the average specific surface area S of quartz
powders, which are shown in Figure 7b.

The surface area S shown
in Figure 7b can be
satisfactorily described by the
mathematical expression 7  where k is the apparent rate
constant for the surface area increase and Sin and Sfin are the initial and
final S values, respectively. Such expression is
similar to eq 5 and suggests
that S can be regarded as the weighted average of
the surface areas Sin and Sfin exhibited by the fractions of quartz powders e–kn and 1 – e–kn. Thus, e–kn measures the
fraction of quartz powders that retains the initial specific surface
area Sin, whereas 1 – e–kn is the fraction that has reached the final
specific surface area Sfin. Accordingly,
any given collision makes a certain amount of quartz powders change
abruptly its average specific surface area from Sin to Sfin. The rate constant k is approximately equal to 1.1 × 10–3. The total mass of powder subjected to processing being equal to
2 g, the mass of quartz powders effectively involved in collisions
corresponds to about 2.2 mg.65

Two
different kinds of active sites can be thought to coexist at
the surface, namely those generated by fracture of quartz particles
involved in a collision, which increases the specific surface area S, and those generated by attrition between quartz particles,
which does not lead to a change of S. The active
sites formed by fracture or by attrition can have different chemical
activities. If Nf and Na are the numbers of active sites formed, respectively,
by fracture and attrition, the DPPH consumption can be described by
the expression 8  Nf and Na are proportional, respectively, to the surface
area generated by fracture at individual collisions and to the total
surface area of powder particles involved in individual collisions.
The increase of specific surface area as a function of the number
of collisions can be obtained by differentiating eq 7, whereas the surface area generated by fracture
can be obtained by multiplying the specific surface area increase
by the mass mp of powder charge. Therefore, Nf and Na can be
expressed as 9  and 10  where α and β are proportionality
constants. Based on eqs 9 and 10, the solution of eq 8 is 11  where NDPPH,in is the initial number
of moles of DPPH.

Equation 11 interpolates
the experimental NDPPH data shown in Figure 7a quite well, providing
best-fitted values for α and β equal to about 8.1 ×
10–5 and 4.7 × 10–6 mol m–2, respectively. These numbers provide a quantitative
estimate of the surface density of active sites generated by fracture
or attrition, respectively. A comparison with the maximum possible
number of dangling bonds that can be formed at the surface, equal
to about 2.1 × 10–5 mol m–2, clearly shows the high level of structural excitation attained
by mechanically activated quartz surfaces.

4.2 Formation of Crystalline Solid Solutions
The mutual
dissolution of Ag and Cu represents a typical example
of mechanical alloying.66 Despite the immiscibility
of the two elements, due to a relatively high positive enthalpy of
mixing, BM induces the formation of a crystalline, chemically disordered,
homogeneous solid solution.

The formation of the solid solution
follows relatively complex kinetics. The dissolution of Ag atoms into
the Cu matrix forms a Cu-rich solid solution, hereafter indicated
as Cu(Ag). At the same time, the dissolution of Cu atoms into the
Ag matrix forms an Ag-rich solid solution, hereafter indicated as
Ag(Cu). A third solid solution, hereafter indicated as (AgCu), forms
as a result of the combination of the two Ag(Cu) and Cu(Ag) solid
solutions, which can be then regarded as intermediates.

The
mass fractions χ of Cu in the different phases are shown
in Figure 8 as a function
of the number of collisions, n. Initially, the mass
fraction of reactant Cu, χreac, corresponds to the
mass fraction of Cu in the mixture, χCu,0. For simplicity,
the mass fractions of Cu in Ag(Cu) and Cu(Ag) solid solutions are
summed to give the total mass fraction of Cu in intermediate phases,
χint. The mass fraction of Cu in the final product,
χfin, consists of the mass fraction of Cu in the
final (AgCu) solid solution. Whereas χreac undergoes
a smooth decrease, χint exhibits a maximum, and χfin follows an increasing sigmoidal trend.

Figure 8 Mass fraction, χ,
of Cu involved in reactant, intermediate,
and final phases as a function of the number of collisions, n. Best-fitted curves are also shown.

Starting from eqs 1 and 2, the kinetic model provides suitable
expressions for describing the kinetic evolution of Cu in reactants,
intermediates, and products.66 The consumption
of reactant Cu is described by the equation 12  where χCu,0 is the initial
amount of Cu in the Ag50Cu50 powder mixture.
The kinetics of Cu in intermediates is described by 13  whereas the fraction of Cu in the final product
is accounted for by the expression 14  

It follows that Cu becomes involved in the formation of the
intermediate
Ag(Cu) and Cu(Ag) solid solutions already after the first collisions,
and that the intermediates transform into the final (AgCu) solid solution
after the third collision. It appears that the whole sequence of transformations
can be described satisfactorily using a single rate constant, k. Best fitting suggests a k value of about
2.2 × 10–6. Since experiments were performed
using a total mass of Cu equal to 8 g, the amount of powder effectively
processed during any individual collision is approximately equal to
17 μg.

by BM induces the formation of an amorphous phase.67 A representative kinetic curve is shown in Figure 9. With the sigmoidal conversion
to the amorphous phase obtained for collision energy of about 0.10
J, a satisfactory best fit can be obtained using eq 4.

Figure 9 Mass fraction of amorphous phase, χ, as
a function of the
number of collisions, n. The best-fitted curve is
also shown.

According to the assumptions
employed to develop the kinetic model,
the results mentioned above indicate that amorphization takes place
in fractions of Ni40Ti60 powders that have undergone
at least two CLCs.

The apparent rate constant, k, for the amorphization
process is approximately equal to 1.5 × 10–6. The experiments were performed with a total mass of powder of 8
g. Therefore, the amount of powder effectively processed at collision
is equal to about 12 μg.

4.4 Formation
of Co-crystals
The mechanical
processing by BM allows mixing two or more chemicals on the molecular
scale, resulting in the formation of co-crystals.68−70 For instance,
clear kinetic evidence has been obtained in the binary nicotinamide–benzoic
acid (na:ba) system using quantitative in situ monitoring
by tandem X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy.70 The data referring to the liquid-assisted grinding of a
stoichiometric na:ba powder mixture in the presence of 4.1 mL of methanol
are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 (a) Some of the polymorphs obtained from benzoic acid and nicotinamide
(na:ba 1/1) by liquid assisted grinding (LAG) with water. (b) Mass
fractions of the polymorph II na:ba co-crystal as a function of time, t. Best-fitted curves are also shown.

Mechanical processing in the presence of methanol leads to
the
formation of polymorph II co-crystal, the process being complete within
approximately 6 min. Further mechanical treatment up to 3 h does not
induce modifications. Under the assumption that a linear relationship
between the number of collisions, n, and the time, t, exists, the model equation 15  can be written. It is able to best
fit satisfactorily
the experimental points, suggesting for the apparent rate constant K value of about 0.13 min–1. Accordingly,
about the 13% of the volume of powder is effectively processed per
minute of mechanical treatment.

4.5 Formation
of MOFs
In situ measurements have also been
used to monitor the mechanochemical
synthesis of zeolitic MOF ZIF-8 from 2-methylimidazole and ZnO.52 The mechanical processing by BM induces a gradual
modification of X-ray diffraction patterns. As shown in Figure 11, the strongest
reflection for ZIF-8 varies according to a sigmoidal trend.

and ZnO. (b) Part of the crystal structure of ZIF-8. (c) Relative
intensity of the (211) reflection of the X-ray diffraction pattern
of the ZIF-8 final product (ILAG = ion liquid assisted grinding).
The best-fitted curve is also shown. Panels b and c are adapted from
ref (52) with permission
from Springer.

An expression similar
to eq 15 can be written
to interpolate the experimental points as
a function of time, t. Specifically, the variation
of the relative intensity of the (211) reflection belonging to the
X-ray diffraction pattern of the ZIF-8 final product can be described
using the expression 16  where Ifin represents
the final value of the relative intensity and K is
the apparent rate constant for the intensity variation. The above
equation can interpolate satisfactorily the experimental data set
with an apparent rate constant K of about 0.25 min–1.

4.6 Synthesis of Organic Compounds
Mechanical
activation by BM has also been successfully used to the preparation
of organic compounds. In situ Raman analyses have
been performed to monitor the mechanochemical condensation between
benzyl and o-phenylenediamine described in Scheme 1.71 The experimental curves shown in Figure 12 reveal a remarkable dependence of reaction
rate on the BM frequency. Such dependence has been tentatively explained
invoking different mechanical activation regimes at low and high milling
frequencies, essentially due to the differences in the mechanical
energy transferred to powders when frictional or impulsive processes
prevail.

Concerning the mechanochemical organic synthesis,
it is worth noting
that not all of the data available can be subjected to satisfactory
interpolation by the model equations. For instance, this is the case
of the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between vanillin and barbituric
acid, described in Scheme 2, and with data summarized in Figure 13.72 It displays
an exponential kinetic curve in solution, while sigmoidal kinetics
has been demonstrated under BM conditions by ex situ analyses.

The reaction kinetics was independent of both the amount
of water
inside the jar and the particle size of reactants. Nonetheless, the
reaction rate increased changing the milling frequency from 15 to
30 Hz and decreased when the reaction scale passed from 0.25 to 1
g. Interestingly, milling induces the transformation of the initial
granular body into a sticky material that adheres to the ball almost
uniformly, giving rise to a homogeneous coating.73 The formation of such coating definitely affects the milling
dynamics, probably leading to the rate enhancement of the reaction,
and points out how changes in rheological properties of processed
matter can give rise to kinetic effects out of reach for purely physicochemical
models.

Sigmoidal kinetic profiles, obtained by ex situ analyses, were observed during the formation of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2-nitrophenyl)disulfane
heterodimer. Depending on the experimental milling conditions, achieved
neat or adding acetonitrile, different polymorphs were formed as indicated
in Scheme 3.74

Scheme 3 Different Milling Conditions Determine Which
Polymorph Is Formed
The in situ investigation of kinetic
behavior
allows attaining unprecedented detail on the transformation path,
unveiling short-lived intermediates and disclosing minute aspects
of experimental evidence. All of that bears the great promise of deeply
impacting the field, catalyzing progress in the definition of kinetic
schemes and the description of macroscopic differential and integral
kinetic laws involved in mechanically induced processes.

5 Mechanistic Inferences
Coupled with the time-resolved
investigation, in situ observation can be also exploited
to gain information on mechanistic
issues. In particular, examining the response of the material to impulsive
loading can allow obtaining mechanistic evidence on the effects of
mechanical stresses on the molecular level.

Toward this aim,
ball drop experiments offer an interesting opportunity.
Indeed, it is relatively easy to combine them with experimental methods
enabling the exploration of the time and length scales of local processes
activated by individual collisions.

The preliminary data on
mechanistic inferences have been obtained
by performing luminescence measurements. The experiments were performed
on thin layers of coumarin 1 powder deposited on a transparent alumina
window. A steel ball of 10 mm in diameter was dropped from a selected
height to collide with the powder layer at a velocity of 5 m s–1, which is close to the collision velocities typically
observed in SPEX Mixer/Mill 8000.

Coumarin 1 has a characteristic
broad emission around the wavelength
of 440 nm, with an excitation band in the near UV region. Coumarin
1 powder was continuously excited with a focalized laser beam and
its luminescence was analyzed with an intensified CCD camera equipped
with a Peltier thermoelectric cooling.

Excitation was provided
by the 405 nm laser line and collected
at 180° through the transparent alumina window by a fiber-coupled
microscope. Spectrally resolved luminescence before, during and after
collisions was monitored using a temporal gate below 10 ms. A picture
of the zone affected by the ball drop, obtained using an optical microscope,
is shown in Figure 14a. Relative luminesce recorded after the collision in steady time
PL condition is shown in Figure 14b together with the emission of the pristine coumarin
1 for comparison.

Figure 14 (a) Region of the coumarin 1 powder layer affected by
the ball
drop. (b) Photoluminescence sampled from initial coumarin 1 (black
curve), and from the inner (blue curve) and outer (red curve) zones
of the region affected by the ball drop.

Luminescence measurements show that the coumarin 1 located
in the
region affected by ball drop exhibits a blue shift with respect to
the pristine powder. The shift observed was up to 20 nm in the inner
zone of the region and progressively decreased with the distance from
the center.75 Collision effects were not
reversible and were confined to an area less than 10 mm2.

The Raman spectra collected from the pristine sample and
the coumarin
1 region affected by ball drop are shown in Figure 15. They reveal that the irreversible changes
in luminescence spectra induced by collisions cannot be ascribed to
a variation of molecular structure, which remains unaffected.

Figure 15 Raman spectra
collected from (black curve) pristine coumarin 1
and from samples subjected to (blue curve) ball drop and (red curve)
BM.

Kinetics of luminescence during
collisions was reconstructed collecting
emitted radiation from the inner zone of the region affected by ball
drop using temporal windows of 10 ms. The obtained spectra are shown
in Figure 16. The
spectroscopic evidence points out that the blue shift takes place
irreversibly on a time scale of about 30 ms.

Figure 16 Photoluminescence sampled
from the inner zone of the region affected
by ball drop. Curves refer to coumarin 1 at the beginning of the ball
collision (black curve) and after 10 (green curve), 20 (red curve),
and 30 (blue curve) ms.

The obtained experimental findings can be connected with
the fact
that fluorescence in coumarin 1 is mainly due to its monomeric form.
In particular, decay kinetics is related to the conversion of fluorescent
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states to non-fluorescent twisted
intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) related phenomena.76 Within this framework, local effects caused
by individual collisions can be tentatively explained invoking the
formation of stacked dyes and H-type aggregates, which involves the
restriction of the ICT to TICT charge transfer mechanism. Therefore,
the observed blue-shift in the luminescence spectra can be reasonably
ascribed to the emission from H-type aggregates.77 While a blue shift in the absorption spectra is a general
feature for H-type aggregates, depending on the excitonic states involved,
the emission spectra of such aggregates exhibit either a blue shift
or a red shift. According to previous works,76,77 in coumarin 1 the emission related to the formation of H-type aggregates
is mainly due to higher excitonic states, and, hence, generating a
blue shift of the overall emission. It follows that the measured luminescence
spectra indicate a local rearrangement of coumarin 1 molecules in
the region of the powder layer affected by ball drop, due to the formation
of highly interacting aggregates due to the collision.

The measurement
of time-resolved luminescence spectra provides
a direct tool to follow in situ the effects of mechanical
stresses generated in the powder layer during ball collisions. Deeper
insight into the local processes governing the rearrangement of coumarin
1 molecules can be gained by decreasing area and time scale of investigation.
This can be expected to give access to information regarding the way
the collision generates mechanical stresses within the granular body.
In principle, this offers the unique opportunity of relating the phenomenological
interpretation of transformation kinetics to refined mechanistic evidence,
enabling the explanation of kinetic data on a fundamental basis.

6 Conclusions
The kinetics of mechanically activated
transformations is a critical
issue along the road to the fundamental understanding of mechanochemical
processes and the rational design of effective mechanical processing
methods and tools. The general strategy for taking on the kinetic
challenge is relatively clear. It involves the development of methods
for characterizing and controlling the milling dynamics, the collection
of refined experimental data and their interpretation with the help
of specific kinetic models, and the study of microscopic processes
activated by individual collisions. In this respect, the present state
of the art appears quite fragmentary and contradictory. The kinetic
evidence is still scarce and barely connected with milling dynamics.

The use of in situ investigations and the availability
of new processing tools show promise to promote progress in the field.
The interpretation of refined kinetic data with a simple, phenomenological
model provides valuable information on the amount of powder susceptible
to effective processing during individual collisions. In turn, this
provides a first link to the local processes activated by the mechanical
stresses generated at the point of collision.

Combining time-resolved
studies with in situ investigation
allows the direct measurement of the effects of mechanical stresses
on individual molecules. Thus, it can help to enlighten researchers
on the way mechanical loads act at the molecular level.

The
correct interpretation of experimental findings in the light
of milling dynamics and the mechanistic study of mechanochemical transformations
represent crucial objectives to achieve. We hope that the present
work will stimulate progress in the field.
