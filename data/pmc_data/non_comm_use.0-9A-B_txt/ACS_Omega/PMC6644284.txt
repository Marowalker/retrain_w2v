Croconaine
dyes are appealing molecules synthesized via the condensation
of croconic acid and reactive electron-donating aromatic or heterocyclic
systems. Here, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)
mass spectrometry (MS) investigation of indolenine-based croconaines
is presented for the first time. Archetype proton-transfer matrices,
such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA), 9-aminoacridine (9AA) as the protonating/deprotonating
matrix, and electron-transfer (ET) secondary-reaction matrices, such
as 1,5-diaminonapthalene (DAN) and trans-2-[3-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB),
were investigated. DHB, CHCA, and 9AA generate a mix of odd-electron
molecular ions and protonated, sodiated, and potassiated adducts.
Among the ET matrices, DAN was found to be capable of directing the
ionization process toward the exclusive formation of odd-electron
molecular ions M+• without fragmentation. MALDI
tandem MS provides useful structural characterization of croconaine
dyes, thus making identification very straightforward for all investigated
compounds. Interestingly the fragmentation of bromo-containing croconaines
revealed, for the first time, the gas-phase formation of a bromime
cation [Br]+.

1 Introduction
Croconaines
are donor–acceptor–donor type zwitterionic
compounds synthesized from croconic acid (4,5-dihydroxy-4-cyclopentene-1,2,3-trione1) via a one-pot condensation reaction with electron-rich
(hetero)aromatic compounds or heterocyclic methylene-active bases.2−4 Croconaines exhibit narrow and intense absorption bands in the NIR,
and their optical properties can be finely tuned either by changing
the donor portions, conjugated to the croconic acid core,5,6 or by inserting diverse substituents on the donor moieties.3,7 Very recently, synthetic strategies leading to derivatives with
tailored photochemical properties have been reviewed.8

Despite the low solubility of croconaines in both
organic and aqueous
media, additional features, such as high photothermal conversion efficiency,9 excellent chemical and photothermal stability,10 and strong solvatochromism,11 have attracted considerable interest toward their application
as effective NIR-absorbing dyes. Furthermore, a recent study has provided
evidences that croconaine dyes could represent promising candidates
for cancer photothermal therapy.12 Interest
in these dyes, however, is not restricted to the above-mentioned fields;
indeed acido- and ionochromisms are revealed to be useful for their
applications in optical sensing of cations13,14 or anions,15 whereas their third-order
nonlinear optical properties appear potentially useful for ultrafast
optical devices.16 Recently, a small library
of indolenine-based croconaines differing for the substituents on
the donor moieties has been synthesized and their molecular structure
fully investigated (by density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction) together with their solid-state
organization.17 Ambipolar semiconducting
properties have been obtained in thin-film transistors, demonstrating
indolenine-based croconaines as a new class of molecular materials
for organic electronics.17

Chemical
and structural characterization of croconaines is typically
performed by 1H- and 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy,
and X-ray diffraction. At present, mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques
appear still confined to a marginal role in characterizing croconaines.
Indeed, electron or chemical ionization methods typically employed
in gas chromatography (GC)-MS are useless since indolenine-based croconaines
cannot be investigated by GC due to molecular masses well above 400
Da. So far, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has
been only used to assess the molecular mass of the synthesized croconaines
(typically detected as deprotonated molecules), whereas structural
characterization studies by tandem or multistage MS are lacking.13,17,18 Note that the above-mentioned
poor solubility of croconaines could hamper ESI-MS measurement since
the best suited solvent ensuring adequate solubility could not be
fully compatible with the ESI source. To the best of our knowledge,
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS19 has never been exploited for croconaine dyes.
Here, the selection of an appropriate matrix capable of ensuring efficient
desorption/ionization of the analytes with minimal or null fragmentation
still represents an open issue.20 Considering
the croconaine structure, containing basic and acidic residues on
an extensively conjugated electron system, common and well-known proton-transfer
(PT) and/or electron-transfer (ET) matrices are likely candidates;21−23 note that PT and ET are potentially competing processes and that
the prevalence of one over the other depends on the analyte–matrix
combination. A set of five representative matrices (exhibiting different
proton affinities and ionization potentials (IPs), vide infra) was
selected which included the following: (i) archetype PT matrices such
as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA); (ii) 9-aminoacridine (9AA) as a protonating/deprotonating
matrix;24 (iii) 1,5-diaminonapthalene (DAN)
capable of acting as the PT/ET matrix,21,22 and (iv) trans-2-[3-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile
(DCTB), an effective and well-recognized nonprotic ET matrix.25 Performance of these matrices is presented,
compared, and discussed in the following using, as model compounds,
five previously described17 indolenine-based
croconaines and a newly synthesized one (see later). Among the investigated
matrices, DAN revealed a soft (i.e., absence of analyte fragmentation)
and a high-performance ET matrix leading solely to the formation of
an odd-electron molecular ion. The fragmentation patterns observed
in MALDI MS/MS experiments are also discussed; the fragmentation of
bromo-containing croconaines revealed the formation of a bromine cation
([Br]+) in the gas phase, which has never been reported
before in MALDI MS experiments.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Laser Desorption Ionization
(LDI)-MS experiments
Indolenine-based croconaines investigated
here are reported in Table 1 along with their
chemical formula, substituent groups on each indolenine moiety, and
monoisotopic mass; note that all croconaines are symmetrical and differ
by the donor substituents, namely, heteroatoms as fluorine (#3–5)
and bromine (#2) or aromatic moieties as 4-phenoxy-phenyl (#1) and
4-nitro-phenyl (#6). Highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied Kohn–Sham
orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels, previously estimated from cyclic
voltammetry (CV) experiments,17 are also
quoted, given their importance in rationalizing the laser desorption
ionization mechanism (vide infra). Unfortunately, DFT calculations
of HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which generally provide ionization
potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) values, respectively, in
good agreement with the experimental data in a vacuum,26 are not available for the investigated compounds.
It follows that HOMO and LUMO energy levels obtained by CV provide
only rough (but still useful) estimates of IP and EA values mainly
because the HOMO/LUMO energies are scaled in vacuum, whereas the reduction/oxidation
potentials are measured in solution.26,27 As expected
for analytes with extended aromatic π-electron systems, all
investigated croconaines are characterized by particularly low IPs
(around 5.3 eV), suggesting a facile direct photoionization process
in the gas phase upon irradiation by Nd:YLF laser (photon energy,
3.6 eV). Indeed, the LDI mass spectrum of, e.g., croconaine #5 (see Figure S1, Supporting Information) shows the
distinct formation of a [M]+• radical ion at m/z 496 that can be easily rationalized
invoking a two-photon ionization process.28 The absolute signal intensity is not particularly high, which is
consistent with a broad and poor absorption band at the laser wavelength
of 345 nm, too far from the absorption maximum at ca. 780 nm (Figure S2, Supporting Information). A similar
behavior is shared by all other investigated compounds. The above
LDI findings suggest that direct analyte photoionization should be
likely expected also in MALDI experiments; however, due to the excess
of matrix, such a process cannot play a significant role since secondary
ionization of an analyte by a matrix is far more likely than the direct
ionization of analyte, unless very high analyte/matrix ratios are
used,29 which is not the case.

2.2 Matrix Evaluation
Figure 1 displays the positive-ion
MALDI MS spectra of croconaine #1 using CHCA (a), DHB (b), and 9AA
(c) as matrices. The base peak at m/z 761.302 in the MALDI spectrum obtained using CHCA as the matrix
(plot (a)) was assigned to the protonated adduct [M + H]+. Interestingly, the concomitant occurrence of an odd-electron molecular
ion, M+•, at m/z 760.298, with a remarkably high yield (ca. 70%, see the inset of
plot (a)) can be observed; since direct photoionization can provide
only a marginal contribution (see the previous paragraph), the formation
of M+• should be mainly due to secondary reactions,
indicating that PT and ET are competing processes. Cationization by
Na+ and/or K+ adduction is completely absent
in the case of CHCA. Different findings were experienced by using
DHB (plot (b)) and 9AA (plot (c)) as matrices; the formation of sodiated
adducts (see the base peak at m/z 783) is now the preferred ionization process. A small contribution
of a K+ adduct also appears, whereas the M+• relative abundance at m/z 760.298 is, in both cases,
around 30% referred to the base peak at m/z 783. Notably, the [M + Na]+/[M + H]+ relative abundance ratio increases considerably passing from CHCA
to DHB to 9AA. For a given analyte, cationization can become the preferred
ionization route when matrices with increasing PA are used, since
the analyte must compete with the neutral matrix for the available
protons in plume secondary reactions.30 Indeed, PA values (see Table 2) increase in the order CHCA < DHB < 9AA, thus providing
a strong support to the above interpretation. As multiple ion formation
for a given analyte is generally considered deleterious, especially
for (semi)quantitative application of MALDI MS, ET matrices were tested
to force the ionization process toward the formation of a single species,
i.e., the radical cation.

Figure 2 shows the
positive-ion MALDI mass spectra of croconaine #1 using (a) DCTB and
(b) DAN as representative ET matrices. Unexpectedly, DCTB was unable
to drive the ionization process toward the prevalent formation of
the radical cation, the protonated adduct being the most abundant
species, followed by the radical ion and the sodiated adduct at m/z 783.284. Moreover, some matrix-related
signals were recorded (at m/z 628
and 873) together with an analyte fragment ion at m/z 687 (observed also using 9AA as a matrix, see Figure 1c); such a fragment
could be assigned as C45H34N2O4Na+, likely originated from the neutral losses
of phenol (C6H6O) and H2. Note that
the DCTB spectrum in the negative-ion mode LDI MS shows the exclusive
formation of the radical anion M–• (data
not shown) whereas in positive-ion mode, the radical cation M+• is formed together with a plethora of other species
such as [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + K]+, and [M – CH3]+, just to cite the most
relevant ones.31 This could be the reason
why DCTB failed to behave as a pure ET transfer matrix (in the positive
mode) for croconaines; however, due to the lack of thermochemical
data, the ionization mechanisms were not investigated further.

Figure 2 Positive-ion
mass spectra by MALDI-ToF of croconaine dye #1 obtained
by using (a) DCTB and (b) DAN as ET matrices. Enlarged isotopic pattern
in insets of the main peaks detected in each spectrum.

A different picture was obtained with DAN (plot
(b) in Figure 2). Indeed,
DAN can
drive the ionization process toward the formation of the odd-electron
molecular ion (see the base peak at m/z 760.298) with nearly 100% yield (see the inset of Figure 2b). Besides, compared with
DCTB, no matrix-related peaks occurred in either positive- or negative-ion
modes (data not shown), thus indicating that DAN shows the best performance
as the matrix (vide infra). From a thermodynamic point of view, ET
secondary reactions are possible when the IP of the analyte is lower
than that of the matrix (IPA < IPM). Among
the investigated matrices, DAN possesses the lowest IP value 6.84
eV,32 which is roughly 1.5 eV higher than
that of cocronaines’ counterpart; such a difference in IPs
should, however, be enough for an effective ET with the additional
advantage of a low excess energy deposited in the M+• ion that justifies the absence of analyte fragmentation.

To
confirm these results, all other synthesized croconaines were
investigated by using CHCA as the PT matrix and DAN as the ET matrix.
As seen for croconaine dye #1, the use of CHCA generated systematically
two or more contributions (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), whereas DAN was confirmed to be the election
matrix for this class of compounds (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Indeed, as reported in Figure 3, it was possible to detect
the radical cation with nearly 100% yield, in the spectra of the croconaine
dye #2 at m/z 582.001 (plot (3a)),
dye #3 at m/z 460.150 (plot (3b)),
and dye #6 at m/z 666.214 (plot
(3c)). All of these signals are in full agreement with theoretical
isotope calculations obtained considering only the radical cation
contribution.

dyes #2

of plot (a) shows the simulated isotopic pattern of a radical molecular
ion with composition [C27H22Br2N2O3]+•, which is in good agreement
with the experimental pattern of croconaine dyes #2.

2.3 MALDI MS/MS of Croconaine
Dyes
After
selecting the best matrix for croconaine dyes, the next step was structural
characterization by tandem MS analyses. Figure 4 shows the positive-ion MALDI MS/MS spectrum
of the precursor ion at m/z 760
referred to croconaine dye #1, with an isolation window of ±3 m/z units using DAN as the matrix. After
isolating and fragmenting the molecular ion ([M]+•), a main peak at m/z 745.36 was
observed due to the facile loss of a methyl radical (•CH3), most likely from the dihydropyrrole ring. The second
abundant peak at m/z 730.55 could
be generated by the alternative loss of neutral formaldehyde (CH2O), in which the croconic acid core may be involved, or more
likely from a consecutive loss of another methyl radical (•CH3) from the second dihydropyrrole ring. The ion cluster
centered at m/z 667.20 can be correlated
to the radical loss of phenol (C6H5O•). For the less intense ions in the spectrum, several hypothetical
product ions can be proposed. For instance, the peak observed at m/z 415.20 can be explained by considering
the breaking of the indolenine core. Also, product ions at m/z 361.19 and 345.20 are related to bond
breaking in the gas phase on different points of the structure, which
more likely involves the further loss of lateral substituents. The
peak at m/z 93.06 is most likely
due to the phenoxy ion arising from the side substituents.

Figure 4 Positive MALDI-ToF/ToF
mass spectrum of croconaine dye #1 precursor
ion at m/z 760 using DAN as the
matrix.

Figure 5 shows the
positive MALDI MS/MS spectrum of the croconaine dye #2 (isolation
window ±5 m/z units) using
DAN as the matrix. This compound contains two symmetrical substituents
bearing bromide as a heteroatom. When fragmenting the ion cluster
centered at m/z 582, two leading
product ions were detected, most likely corresponding to the successive
loss of two radical methyl moieties from the dihydropyrrole rings,
as occurred with dye #1 (see signals at m/z 567.07 and 552.14); an additional methyl loss can generate
the small peak at m/z 537.14. The
ion at m/z 330.08 could originate
from different losses as its isotopic pattern appears to be an envelope
of at least two contributions. For instance, it could be due to the
neutral loss of bromobenzene (C6H5Br) from one
side and bromide (Br) from the other substituent together with methyl
loss or more likely it could be explained as the loss of the whole
substituent 5-bromo-3,3-dimethylindoline from one side and methyl
from the other symmetric side. The peak at m/z 276 is most likely generated from that at m/z 332 assigned as croconic moiety missing a methyl
group upon loss of ethene-1,2-dione [C2O2].

Figure 5 Positive
MALDI-ToF/ToF mass spectrum of croconaine dye #2 with
the precursor ion at m/z 582 using
DAN as the matrix. Note the occurrence of a cluster at m/z 78.94 and 80.93 due to bromine cation.

Besides other low-intensity product
ions likely generated by successive
losses of water (18 Da) or methyl radical (15 Da), an interesting
ion doublet was detected at m/z 78.94
and 80.93. According to both the accurate mass and isotopic pattern,
this cluster can be easily attributed to bromine cation, [Br]+, formed via heterolytic cleavage. The presence of this ion
species may appear anomalous since bromine follows the octet rule
and usually is detected in a negative-ion mode as a bromide ion. Although
much less intense, the product ions at m/z 501–503
are also evident following the initial loss of a bromine Br• radical (i.e., homolytic cleavage). The use of the same croconaine
dye #2 and a PT matrix such as CHCA (Figure S5, Supporting Information) provides no evidence of bromine cation.
This is the first time that the Br+ has been described
in a MALDI experiment but it is not completely unusual using other
techniques, including inductively coupled plasma-MS33 and glow-discharge ionization source.34,35

3 Conclusions
Here, we have reported
for the first time that DAN can be successfully
used as a matrix to explore intact croconaine dyes by means of MALDI
MS in a positive-ion mode. The prevailing ionization process of croconaines
by DAN seems to be an ET secondary-reaction mechanism, thus hindering
the splitting of ion contribution to protonated and cationized adducts,
as observed with other examined matrices. Tandem MS of the radical
molecular ions was found to be very useful to characterize the structure
of these dyes. The most singular result was observed with the gas-phase
formation of bromine cation on croconaines bearing Br as heteroatom
substituents. This outcome has never been reported before, at least
under MALDI MS experimental conditions. It is plausible that DAN will
be actively used as a major MALDI matrix in identifying novel croconaine
dyes.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Water, acetone, methanol,
chloroform, 1,5-diaminonapthalene (DAN), trans-2-[3-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile
(DCTB), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), whereas
9-aminoacridine hemihydrate was purchased from Acros Organics (Morris
Plains, NJ). All solvents used were of LC–MS grade. A Mass
Standard Kit for calibration was purchased from AB Sciex (Ontario,
Canada).

4.2 Instrumentation
All experiments were
performed using a 5800 MALDI-ToF/ToF analyzer (AB SCIEX, Darmstadt,
Germany) equipped with a neodymium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride
(Nd:YLF) laser (345 nm), in a reflectron positive mode, with a typical
mass accuracy of 10 ppm. In MS and MS/MS modes, 1000 laser shots were
typically accumulated by a random rastering pattern, at laser pulse
rates of 400 and 1000 Hz, respectively; each shown mass spectrum was
averaged on at least five single mass spectra (1000 laser shots each).
The laser fluences were within 1.9–2.6 J/m2 depending
on the matrix employed. MS/MS experiments were performed setting a
potential difference of 1 kV between the source and the collision
cell; ambient air was used as the collision gas with a medium pressure
of 10–6 Torr. The delayed extraction time was set
at 280 ns.

DataExplorer software 4.0 (AB Sciex) was used to
control the acquisitions and to perform the initial elaboration of
data, whereas SigmaPlot 11.0 was used to graph the final mass spectra.
ChemDraw Pro 8.0.3 (CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge, MA) was
employed to draw chemical structures. Isotopic pattern contribution
was generated by Xcalibur 4.0 with Foundation 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

4.3 Croconaine Synthesis
Indolenine-based
croconaines bearing different substituents on the donor moieties were
synthetized following a protocol based on condensation of croconic
acid (1 equiv) and of indolenine (2 equiv) in a refluxing mixture
of toluene and butanol. Synthesis and characterization of croconaines
#1–4 and #6 (see Table 1) were carried out in accordance with a previously reported
procedure.17 Synthesis of the new croconaine
#5, namely, 3-(5,7-difluoro-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-ylidenemethyl)-5-(5,7-difluoro-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-2-ylmethylene)-4-hydroxy-cyclopent-3-ene-1,2-dione,
is described in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Sample Preparation and MALDI MS Analysis
All investigated croconaines were dissolved in chloroform at a
concentration of 2.0 mM. CHCA, DHB, and 9AA matrices were prepared
in methanol at a concentration of 50 mM, whereas DAN and DCTB matrices
were prepared in acetone at a concentration of 32 mM. Unless otherwise
specified, 5 μL of each croconaine solution was mixed (1:1,
v/v ratio) with matrix solution and 1 μL of mixture was spotted
on the target plate, dried in the dark, and analyzed by MALDI MS.

WARNING: Caution should be reserved when handling DAN due to its
possible carcinogenetic effects. Exposure to this compound should
be minimized, and fume hoods should always be used.
