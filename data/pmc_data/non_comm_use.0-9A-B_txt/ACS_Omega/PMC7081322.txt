The solid–liquid
equilibrium data of the aqueous NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O, NaOH–Na2CO3–NaCl–H2O, and NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O quaternary
systems at 363.15 K were measured. The equilibrium solid phases and
solubilities of salts in the three systems and its subsystems were
determined. The densities of the saturated solutions were also determined.
The experimental data are used to plot the solubility diagrams and
water content diagrams of the systems. It was found that the NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O system contains the solid solution of γ-salt (mNa2SO4·nNa2CO3) and the other two systems Na2CO3–NaOH–NaCl–H2O and NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O have the
complex salts S1 (Na2SO4·NaOH) and S3 (Na2SO4·NaCl·NaOH). On the basis of Xu’s
activity coefficient model, a model was constructed for the correlation
of solid–liquid equilibrium in electrolyte solutions to calculate
the solubilities of salts in these systems at 363.15 K. The calculated
solubilities are in agreement with the experimental values.

1 Introduction
There are abundant
resources of natural soda in Inner Mongolia and Henan Province in
China. The major components of natural soda include sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and sodium chloride
(NaCl).2 Based on these components, natural
soda can be used to produce caustic soda. After natural soda is dissolved
in water, insoluble impurities can be removed through the flocculation
clarification process. When lime milk is added, which reacts with
sodium carbonate to form a caustic solution, the NaOH concentration
in caustic liquor is usually approximately 8–10%. Considering
the economic efficiency and equilibrium conversion rate (the causticization
rate is generally controlled at approximately 90%), as well as the
fact that only a very small amount of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is retained, diluted caustic soda liquid can be regarded
as a quinary system of NaOH–NaCl–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O.

To obtain caustic soda products that meet quality standards, the
caustic soda liquid should be concentrated, and Na2SO4, NaCl, and a small amount of Na2CO3 impurities should be removed. The evaporation method for producing
caustic soda through the causticizing process generally involves three-effect
evaporation. The first-effect temperature is approximately 423.15
K, at which the concentration of caustic soda can be controlled at
11–12% and the diluted caustic soda liquid is concentrated;
the second-effect temperature is approximately 393.15 K, at which
the concentration of caustic soda is generally controlled at approximately
19–20% to achieve partial removal of the impurities; and the
third-effect temperature is approximately 363.15 K, at which the concentration
of caustic soda is controlled at 45–48%. At the third-effect
temperature, Na2SO4 and NaCl3 are removed to concentrate the diluted caustic soda liquid
and remove impurities; then, the caustic soda liquid is allowed to
cool to achieve separation, dehydration, and solidification to form
solid caustic soda that meets the quality requirements. In the actual
production process, only the third-effect temperature is controlled
at 363.15 K; at this point, the evaporated liquor has reached saturation
and salting-out. Therefore, 363.15 K was chosen as the research temperature
in this paper.

Liu et al.4 systematically
studied the phase diagram of the quinary system NaOH–NaCl–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O at 423.15 K. Stephen et al.5,6 collected detailed
phase equilibrium data for the binary and ternary subsystems related
to the quinary system under consideration at 363.15 K. Su et al.7,8 studied a related quaternary system and obtained partial solubility
data. To date, the phase equilibrium data for the quaternary subsystems
of the quinary system NaOH–NaCl–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O,
including NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O, NaOH–NaCl–Na2CO3–H2O, NaOH–NaCl–Na2SO4–H2O, and NaCl–Na2CO3–Na2SO4, are yet
to be perfected. Xu et al.1 proposed a
new hypothesis for the reference state of activity coefficients; literature
data for single electrolyte solutions and mixed electrolyte solution
systems, NaCl–H2O, Na2SO4–H2O, and NaCl–Na2SO4–H2O, with temperatures spanning from 273.15 to 373.15 K, were
successfully correlated using Xu’s activity coefficient model.

The purpose of the present work is to determine the phase equilibrium
data and the characteristics of the ternary and quaternary subsystems
of the NaOH–NaCl–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O quinary system at 363.15
K to clarify the appropriate concentration of NaOH in the evaporated
solution in caustic solution evaporation and provide basic data for
the production of caustic soda through causticization. Moreover, the
solubilities of these subsystems at 363.15 K are calculated using
Xu’s activity coefficient model.

A thermostatic water bath (76-1, Jiangsu Tianyou
Co., Ltd.) with a precision of ±0.1 K was used for the solid–liquid
equilibrium (SLE) measurements. In addition, we used a thermostatic
water bath (KSA-II thyristor dc governor, 2.2 kW, Ningbo Beilun District
Zhitou Electronic Control Equipment Factory), circulating heated water,
to achieve a uniform mixture of the solid and liquid phases. An analytical
balance, with an accuracy of ±0.001 g (ALC-110.4, Sartorius AG,
Germany), was used for weighing; a muffle furnace (SX-1300 °C,
Tianjin Zhonghuan Experimental Electric Furnace Co., Ltd.) was used
to burn the precipitate; and an intelligent temperature controller
(XMTG-6000, Jiangsu Taizhou Haige Instrument Co., Ltd.), which was
calibrated against a temperature calibrator, was used.

2.2 Experimental Methods
The system points were prepared as follows. For the ternary systems,
the system points were prepared by gradually adding the second component
on the basis of the single salt saturation points. For the quaternary
systems, the system points were prepared by adding the third component
on the basis of the double salt cosaturation points. Each solubility
curve was prepared using 5–15 groups, and an appropriate amount
of distilled water was added to each group of mixtures. The matched
experimental solutions were put into glass bottles (30 mL, 3.5 cm
in diameter, and 6.5 cm high), sealed with rubber plugs and aluminum
caps, placed in a thermostatic water bath (363.15 ± 0.1 K) with
a rotating drum, and rotated at a constant speed in the thermostatic
water bath to achieve phase equilibrium.9

The experimental setup, which was established in accordance
with the characteristics of the studied system, is shown in Figure 1. The balancing device
could also be used for static and sampling operations to prevent temperature
changes in the external environment from disturbing the balance of
the samples. A micro ac constant-speed motor made of plexiglass was
used at a speed of 60 rpm to achieve liquid–solid phase equilibrium.
The equilibrium time was approximately three days; after equilibrium
was achieved, the supernatant liquid was removed from the balanced
bottle every few hours and chemical analysis was conducted. If the
relative error among the three consecutive sampling was below 0.003,
the equilibrium could be considered to be achieved. It was determined
using the experimental results with the equilibrium time and static
time in Table 2. At
equilibrium, the sample solutions were allowed to rest for 3 days
to separate the solid and liquid phases and kept in a constant-temperature
oil bath. The upper portion of the sealed bottles was kept above the
liquid level to prevent oil from entering the balanced bottles during
sampling and then affecting the experimental results. After reaching
equilibrium, the sampling tubes were preheated in an oven to avoid
disturbing the equilibrium, and then the supernatant was used to determine
the chemical composition of the equilibrium liquid phase via chemical
analysis.10

To prevent effects from
CO2 in the air, the samples were collected in a nitrogen
cabinet. The contents of CO2 in the vapor phase were quite
small in most cases: the ratio of the partial pressure to the total
pressure in the equilibrium vapor phase was only 0.09–0.25%.
In addition, the experimental systems were sealed and the volumes
of the vapor phases were much smaller than those of the liquid and
solid phases. Accordingly, the formation of CO2 had almost
no effect on the equilibrium fluid composition.

2.3 Analytical Methods
2.3.1 Liquid-Phase Analytical Methods
According to a previously reported method,11,12 the
total alkali (sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide) content was titrated
with standard hydrochloric acid using methyl orange solution as an
indicator. The content of NaOH was determined by excess alkalimetry
using phenolphthalein solution as an indicator. The chlorine ion concentration
was measured by silver nitrate titration. The content of sulfate ions
was determined by a gravimetric method. The details of the abovementioned
analytical methods can be found in the literature.13 The solution density was measured by the density bottle
method with a precision of ±0.0002 g. Each experiment was performed
three times in parallel, and a relative standard uncertainty of 0.05
was achieved.14−17,21 The results
of the repeatability experiments shown in Table 3 confirmed that the phase equilibrium data
measured by the setup in this work had good repeatability.

2.3.2 Identification of the
Solid Phase
The solids were analyzed by the wet residue method.
The wet residue point and the liquid phase point were on the same
line, and the equilibrium solid point was on the extension line. The
solids were then analyzed by the abovementioned method to obtain the
composition of the solid phases. In addition, the crystalloid form
could be identified by an auxiliary method; that is, the wet solid
sample was further prepared by drying with filter paper and studied
by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).18 To
confirm the reliability of the experimental apparatus and method utilized
in this article, before the formal experiment, we measured the data
for one cosaturation point of the system NaCl–NaOH–H2O with the experimental apparatus developed. The results (shown
in Table 4) were in
good accordance with the data in the literature.5,6

The measured solubilities of the ternary system NaCl–NaOH–H2O at 363.15 K are presented in Table 6. The compositions of the saturated solution
and wet solid phase are expressed as mass fractions. The
corresponding phase diagram is shown in Figure 4. There is one cosaturation point, E, and
two crystallization regions, CDE and EBF. Point E corresponds to the
cosaturation of NaCl + NaOH. The two solubility curves of this ternary
system are represented by curves DE and FE. The crystallization field

3.1.3 NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O System at 363.15 K
The experimental solubilities and equilibrium solids of the quaternary
system NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O at 363.15 K are listed in Table 7. Based on the Jänecke
dry salt indices, the dry salt solubility and water diagrams are plotted
in Figure 6. A solid
solution (γ, mNa2SO4·nNa2CO3) without complex salt was
formed. Points E1, E2, E3, and E4 are the cosaturation points representing the saturation of
Na2SO4 + γ + Na2SO4·NaOH, NaOH + Na2SO4·NaOH + γ,
NaOH + Na2CO3 + Na2CO3·H2O, and NaOH + Na2CO3·H2O + γ, respectively. The system also contains six crystallization
fields, which are represented by NaOH, Na2CO3, Na2CO3·H2O, Na2SO4, S1(Na2SO4·NaOH), and γ-salt.
The γ-salt has the largest crystallization field, indicating
that it has the lowest solubility and thus can be readily crystallized
out. The XRD patterns of points E1, E2, E3, and E4 are given in Figure 7.

3.1.4 Na2CO3–NaOH–NaCl–H2O System at 363.15 K
The experimental solubility
data for the quaternary system Na2CO3–NaOH–NaCl–H2O at 363.15 K were determined and combined with the literature
data. These data are presented in Table 8 in 15 groups, and the solution composition
of the equilibrium liquid phase is expressed in terms of the mass
fraction and Jänecke index (g/100 g dry salt). The corresponding
phase and water diagrams of the system are shown in Figure 8. The phase diagram consists
of two points, E1 and E2, which are the cosaturation
points of NaOH + Na2CO3 + NaCl and Na2CO3·H2O + Na2CO3 + NaCl, respectively; and four crystallized regions, AGE2FA, FBDE1E2F, GE2E1CG,
and E1DCH, which correspond to Na2CO3·H2O, NaCl, Na2CO3, and NaOH,
respectively. Among the crystallization fields, the crystallization
field of Na2CO3·H2O is the largest,
suggesting that this salt is very easily crystallized because of its
lower solubility in the quaternary system. Neither a solid solution
nor a complex salt was formed. The XRD patterns of the cosaturation
points (E1 and E2) are given in Figure 9.

3.1.5 NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O System at 363.15
K
The measured solubilities in the quaternary system NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O at 363.15
K are shown in Table 9 and are expressed in terms of the mass fraction and Jänecke
index. By combining the abovementioned data, the dry salt and water
diagrams of the system were prepared and are plotted in Figure 10. The system includes
four three-salt cosaturation points (E1, E2,
E3, and E4) and five crystallization fields
(Na2SO4, NaCl, Na2SO4·NaCl·NaOH,
Na2SO4·NaOH, and NaOH), among which the
Na2SO4 and NaCl crystallization fields are larger
than the other three. These results show that complex salts (S1, Na2SO4·NaOH and S3, Na2SO4·NaCl·NaOH) are formed in the system without the formation
of a solid solution. Figure 11 shows the XRD patterns of the cosaturation points in this
system. According to this figure, points E1, E2, E3, and E4 correspond to the cosaturation
points of S1 + S3 + S, Cl + S + S3, OH + S3 + Cl, and S1 + S3 + OH,
respectively.

4 Solubility Predictions
For SLEs, Xu1,19−21 proposed a
new hypothesis for the reference state of activity coefficients with
respect to solubility predictions. In the model, he assumed that the
new reference state of activity coefficients is the activity of the
solute: ai (=mi × γi) → 1 as mi → the solubility. This reference is meaningful only
for SLE, not other situations.

For the calculation, water–salt
parameters for electrolyte solutions are shared in single salt systems
and mixed salt systems. The excess Gibbs energy is described as follows 1   2   3   4  

The function of Gwe is based on ∑i∑j≠i(mimjλi,j) in the excess Gibbs energy function of
the Pitzer model and Gwe is adopted to account for the electrostatic
interaction term between single electrolyte and water. The function
of Gxe is based on ∑i∑j,j≠i(mimjmkλi,j,k) in Pitzer’s and Gxe is the electrostatic interaction
term between salt and salt, which is usually used in multicomponent
electrolyte solutions. It is assumed that solubility of every dissolved
solid is affected by other solutes in multicomponent electrolyte solutions,
where mi and mj are the molalities of the
solute; Ei, Fi,j, and Gi,j are the interaction parameters
at a particular temperature; kx = 0.5.

We obtain the activity coefficient expression of the solute from eqs 1–4, the expression for the solute is as follows 5   6  

We
obtain the activity expression from eq 6, and the activity of the solute is as follows 7  

Then, based on the reference state of activity coefficients
(ai → 1 as mi → the solubility)
in this model, the solubility of the corresponding solute is obtained.
The expression of the calculation is as follows 8  where mx is the solubility of the solute.

The main expressions of the ion activity coefficient and the osmotic
coefficient of water for the equation are briefly shown above. In
this work, we calculated the solubility mx of the corresponding solute. The software used for this calculation
was 1stopt 6.0, and the computational algorithm was the Universal
Global Algorithm.

Table 10 presents the values of the parameters introduced in eq 5; the solute–solute
parameters1 are listed.

The predictive
capability of the model was examined by calculating SLE in mixed electrolyte
solution systems using the parameter values obtained from the correlations
of binary electrolyte solution systems. The predicted SLE data for
the solutions NaOH–NaCl–H2O, NaOH–Na2SO4–H2O, NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O, NaOH–Na2CO3–NaCl–H2O, and NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O are shown in Tables 11–15 and Figures 12–16.

The simulation data for the system at 363.15 K were obtained using
the model and the parameters in Table 10. Comparisons of the experimental and calculated
values of the ternary and quaternary invariant points for the quaternary
system at 363.15 K are given in Tables 11–15; the calculated
phase diagram is plotted using the simulation data in Figures 12–16. The analysis of the model as presented in the figures and
tables shows that the simulation data agree well with the experimental
data.

5 Conclusions
The solubilities of the quaternary systems (NaOH–Na2CO3–Na2SO4–H2O, NaOH–Na2CO3–NaCl–H2O, and NaOH–Na2SO4–NaCl–H2O) at 363.15 K were determined using the isothermal solubility
method. The solid minerals were identified using X-ray diffraction.
According to the experimental data and the identification result,
the isothermal phase diagrams were plotted. The phase diagrams determined
for the quaternary systems were applied in the analysis of the vaporization
process, laying the foundation for research on the phase equilibrium
of the quinary system.

Combining the experimental solubility
data of the systems, the corresponding parameters were fitted with
Xu’s modified activity coefficient model. Then, the solubilities for the systems
at 363.15 K were demonstrated. A comparison of the calculated and
experimental solubilities of the systems showed that the predicted
solubilities are in accordance with experimental values.
