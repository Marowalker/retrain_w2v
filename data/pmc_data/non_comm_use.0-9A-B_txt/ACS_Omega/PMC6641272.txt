In
this study, the in situ sol–gel method
has been deployed to prepare the titanium dioxide/multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (TiO2/MWCNTs) nanocomposite (NCs) powders with
varying content of MWCNTs (0.01–1.0 wt %), to construct the
dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). First, binder-free NCs were deposited
on a transparent-conducting F:SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate
by a doctor-blade technique and then anchored with Ru(II)-based dyes
to either N719 or ruthenium phthalocyanine (RuPc). The structural
and optical properties and interconnectivity of the materials within
the composite are investigated thoroughly by various spectral techniques
(XRD, XPS, Raman, FT-IR, and UV–vis), electron microscopy (HRTEM),
and BET analysis. The experimental results suggest that the ratio
of MWCNTs and TiO2 in NCs, morphology, and their interconnectivity
influenced their structural, optical, and photovoltaic properties
significantly. Finally, the photovoltaic performances of the assembled
DSSCs with different content of MWCNTs to TiO2 films anchored
with two different dyes were tested under one sun irradiation (100
mW/cm2). The measured current–voltage (IV) curve and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE)
spectra of TiO2/0.1 wt % MWCNTs (T@0.1 C) for N719 dye
show three times more power conversion efficiency (η = 6.21%)
which is opposed to an efficiency (η = 2.07%) of T@0.1
C for RuPc dye under the same operating conditions.

Introduction
Solar energy has become
one of the fastest growing industries among
all current energy industries. Among the various renewable energy
sources, sunlight energy is the largest global energy source and reaches
the earth’s surface at an average of 4.3 × 1020 J h–1,1 which is equal
to the annual energy demand of today’s society. A few generations
of solar cell research are already in place for the fabrication of
solar cells that convert solar light to electrical power.2,3 However, for the last two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
seem to be one of the most promising, due to their low cost, easy
construction and also generate comparable power conversion efficiency
to silicon solar cells.4 In brief, DSSCs
consist of two electrodes, namely, working electrodes (dye-coated
semiconductors) and counter electrodes (platinized ITO glass) having
an organic-based redox electrolyte (I–/I3–) between these two electrodes. Most of the research
has focused on either using a semiconductor TiO2 or various
ruthenium(II) [Ru(II)] based dyes.5 However,
the other critical parameters, such as electron density, the mobility
of charge carriers, right alignment of energy levels (HOMO and LUMO)
of the dye, or redox mediator with respect to valence band and conduction
band energy level of the semiconductor, also play a pivotal role in
the enhancement of photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.6 However, the power conversion efficiency (η) of these
devices has reached up to 14.5%.7 This
efficiency is less as compared to the S–Q limit (theoretical efficiency of 34% for a single p–n
junction)8 of DSSCs or nanomaterial-based
solar devices (theoretical efficiency up to 66%).9 Therefore, the devices with modified TiO2 (varied
in optical and electronic) electrode, anchored with various Ru(II)
sensitizers (either N719 or RuPc), would benefit from harvesting more
photons from a broad range of the solar spectrum.

Various strategic
synthetic routes have been employed, such as
doping,10 supported with metal/metal oxides,11 or composites,12 to
tune the optical, electrical, porosity, and structure-induced morphology
of TiO2; however, importance has been placed on preparing
the visible active composites of TiO2 nanoparticles
(NPs) with highly conducting MWCNTs.13 TiO2-MWCNTs NCs research has focused more on design of the electrode
for solar energy harvesting materials. The reported synthesis of TiO2/MWCNTs NCs requires high temperature, expensive chemicals,
and materials, and moreover, their nonuniform morphology lowers the
performance as working electrode materials. Earlier, Wang et al. synthesized
TiO2/MWCNTs nanohybrids by a single-step laser pyrolysis
technique via both in situ and ex situ ways. However, DSSC efficiencies comprised of these electrodes were
limited to only 3.9% and 3.3%.14 Moreover,
the pyrolysis techniques always require state-of-the-art advanced
and expensive equipment which is not desirable for photovoltaic technology.15 Mahmood et al. reported the DSSC efficiency
of 5.25% using 0.06 wt % MWCNTs along with commercially purchased
TiO2 paste. These photoelectrodes were prepared by mixing
MWCNTs in ethanol with the TiO2 paste using the sonochemical
method.16 However, MWCNTs not uniformly
decorated with TiO2 particles by this technique were confirmed
by TEM analysis. The use of only bare MWCNTs always retards the electron
transport between the semiconducting photoelectrode to the counter
electrode, overall decreasing the power conversion efficiency of the
cells. A high-temperature hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2/MWCNTs NCs was also reported and resulted in the device efficiency
of up to 7.37%, which is higher than that of bare TiO2 NPs
as well as Degussa P25 NPs.17 The 5 wt
% MWCNTs content composites of  TiO2/MWCNTs thin films
prepared by an electrospinning technique reported a greater efficiency.18 The agglomeration is the key problem of this
kind of TiO2/MWCNTs NCs. These NCs also absorb the incident
photons actively which retard the electron–hole separation
and lower the photovoltaic performance.19 Also, the electrospinning technique always produces the irregular
and nonuniform morphology structure within the NCs which often results
in low power energy conversion efficiencies.

Ru(II)-based sensitizers
have played a significant role in the
development of the solar cells as a chromophore. The efficiency of
the DSSCs could be improved significantly if these dyes have absorption
in the range of visible to NIR of the solar spectrum.20 Researchers have studied various chromophores including
metal complexes and organic-based dyes. Among all dyes, Ru(II) polypyridine-based
sensitizers, mainly black dye, N3, and N719, are the better chromophores
for DSSCs due to their promising chemical and photochemical stability
along with enhanced photovoltaic performance.21 Similarly, the RuPc dye is also used as an alternative dye for DSSCs
due to its analogues to N719 dye’s structure, chemical and
photochemical stability, and high molar extinction coefficient. Indeed,
this intrinsic nature of RuPc dye promotes harvesting of more photons
in the entire range of the visible to NIR solar spectrum. Also, the
suitable electrochemical redox property of RuPc is utilized as a promising
dye to anchor semiconducting metal oxides (TiO2) for other
applications.22

In this work, we
report the synthesis of  TiO2/MWCNTs
NCs with varying content of MWCNTs by in situ sol–gel
method, and then these materials are well characterized by various
spectroscopies (XRD, XPS, UV–vis, PL, FT-IR, and Raman), microscopy
techniques (HRTEM), and BET measurements for knowing their structural,
morphological, and optical properties. Thereafter, these materials
are deposited on FTO glass substrates by a doctor blade technique
to form the photoelectrodes. Finally, the photovoltaic performances
of the assembled sandwiched devices made of a different composite
of TiO2/MWCNTs are measured (IV and IPCE)
under one sun condition (100 mW/cm2) and compared with
two different dyes (N719 and RuPc).

Results and Discussion
The thermal stability and existence of MWCNTs in the NC samples
were studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and illustrated
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1,
SI). The crystal structure of the pure phase of the materials (MWCNTs,
bare TiO2 NPs, and TiO2/MWCNTs NCs) was characterized
by using a Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. XRD pattern of
MWCNTs (Figure 1(a))
shows a sharp peak at 26.17 corresponding to a (002) reflection, confirming
the presence of elemental carbon (JCPDS No. 41-1487). XRD patterns
of TiO2 and different TiO2/MWCNTs NCs are presented
in Figure 1(b). The
various peaks observed at ∼25.21 (101), ∼37.63 (004),
∼47.90 (200), ∼53.89 (105), ∼55.03 (211), ∼62.57
(204), ∼69.98 (220), and ∼74.93 (215) are the characteristic
peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272). The sharp, intense
peaks of the samples reveal the crystalline nature with crystallite
size in the range between 15 and 19 nm. The structural cell parameters
of the samples are calculated and presented (Table S1, SI). The expected peak position at 26.17 (002)
reflection for MWCNTs did not appear in the TiO2/MWCNTs
NCs because of either a tiny amount present in the composition or
shielding by the most intense peak of anatase TiO2 appearing
at ∼25.21 (101).23 As the content
of MWCNTs increases in composite, a small change is observed in the
peak positions with a definitive increase in the intensity of characteristic
peaks of TiO2. The change in the peak positions of samples
is reflected through the various cell parameters, crystallite size,
and lattice strain,24 while the shifts
in the intensity of the peaks are justified through the lattice sites
of ions present in the TiO2 lattice (Table S1, SI).25

and (b) bare TiO2 NPs and
TiO2/MWCNTs NCs with varying content of MWCNTs from
0.01 to 1.0 wt %.

The quantitative studies
related to structural properties were
further confirmed by the Rietveld refinement method using the Fullprof
2000 software package. Rietveld refined XRD patterns of the bare TiO2 NPs and T@0.1C NCs are shown in Figure 2(a,b), and the remaining patterns are also
shown in the Supporting Information (Figures
S3, S4, S5, and S6, SI).

Figure 2 XRD Rietveld refined patterns of (a) bare TiO2 NPs
and (b) T@0.1C NCs.

The lattice reflections
such as (101), (004), (112), (200), (202),
(105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) in the Rietveld refined
XRD patterns confirm the formation of the tetragonal anatase crystal
structure. In the refinement, the oxygen positions (x, y, z) have been considered as
free parameters, and fractional atomic positions have been taken as
fixed. Other parameters such as lattice, temperature, occupancies,
scale factors, and shape parameters have also been considered as free
parameters. The quality of the Rietveld refinement quantified by the
corresponding figures of merit, viz., Rwp, the goodness of fit (χ2), and pseudo-Voigt function,
corrected the background of the pattern.

The atomic coordinates
and occupancies of different atoms of the
different samples are also presented (Table S2, SI). In the entire refined patterns, the value of “goodness
of fit (χ2)” lies in the range of 1–1.5;
this indicates well the extent of fitting. (The Rietveld refined factors
such as χ2, Rwp, Rexp, RB, RF, etc. of all samples are summarized in Table 1.) The values of the
various R factors are slightly higher, which may
be due to the nanocrystalline nature of the samples and also could
be assigned to the larger signal-to-noise ratio.26 Based on these Rietveld refinements, the average crystallite
sizes (D) have been calculated using the Scherrer
formula, which is observed from 17 to 24 nm. The increase in crystallite
size, as well as little change related to lattice parameters of the
samples, is observed with increasing composition of MWCNTs in the
TiO2 host lattice.

Raman spectra of the bare TiO2 NPs, MWCNTs only, and
representative T@0.1 C NCs are shown in Figure 3(a). Raman spectrum of TiO2 NPs
shows the characteristic peaks at 144.69, 398.4, 516.78, and 640.92
cm–1 corresponding to the Eg (1), B1g, A1g, and Eg (2) modes of vibrations,
respectively.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of bare TiO2 NPs, T@0.1C NCs,
and MWCNTs
(inset).

These peaks confirm the presence
of the anatase phase only, which
is in good agreement with the XRD results.27 Raman spectrum of MWCNTs is shown in the inset, which shows two
bands, namely, the D band and G band. The D band is an indicative
disorder in the graphitic structure at 1346.10 cm–1 due to the disorder induced by sp3 hybridization, whereas
the G band (characteristic ordered graphitic structure) at 1585.01
cm–1 corresponds to ordered sp2 hybridization
of MWCNTs. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) for the functionalized MWCNTs also reveals
the presence of acidic functional moieties on the surface of MWCNTs
with the conversion of the carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3 hybridization. Raman spectrum of functionalized MWCNTs with
fitting results (Figure 3b) show graphitizable carbon activated by acidic functional moieties.28 Raman spectrum of a representative T@0.1 C
NCs shows all the characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 along
with D (1350.96 cm–1) and G (1582.32 cm–1) bands of MWCNTs. It emphatically reveals the existence of MWCNTs
composition in the NCs.29 The decrease
in the peak intensity, with little shifting in the peak positions
of all Raman bands for NCs, is shown in Figure 3 (c and d). It is usually due to the increase
in the crystallite size with an increase in the MWCNTs content in
the TiO2 host lattice.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM)
with seleced area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of MWCNTs,
bare TiO2 NPs and T@0.1 C NCs are shown in Figure 4 (a to i). TEM image (Figure 4(a)) of MWCNTs shows
the cylindrical tubes having an average outer diameter in the range
between 20 and 25 nm and a few micrometers in length. From HRTEM image (Figure 4(b)), the distance
between the two successive inner layers of MWCNTs is around 0.33 nm,
while the diameter between the two outermost shells is 23 nm. SAED
pattern (Figure 4(c))
shows the bright ring patterns, which correctly match to the spacing
of the (002), (100), and (006) reflections. Figure 4(d,e,f) shows TEM, HRTEM, and SAED patterns
of the bare TiO2 NPs. A TEM image shows the spherical nanostructures
having a mean particle diameter of 15–20 nm, while spacing
for the (101) lattice fringes is 0.352 nm. SAED pattern indicates
excellent crystallinity due to a clear ring structure with lattice
points that directly match the anatase phase of TiO2. Figure 4(g,h,i) shows TEM,
HRTEM, and SAED patterns of representative T@0.1 C NCs. TEM image
shows the spherical nanostructures of the TiO2 NPs directly
anchored on the surface of MWCNTs, and no bare MWCNTs is observed
because of the high wall anchoring as well as density of TiO2 NPs.

Figure 4 (a,d,g) TEM images, (b,e,h) HRTEM images, and (c,f,i) SAED patterns
of MWCNTs, bare TiO2 NPs, and T@0.1 C NCs.

HRTEM micrograph shows that the clear fringes precisely
match to
the spacing of the (101) reflection of TiO2 NPs. However,
uncleared fringes of MWCNTs are observed in the NCs because, in the in situ chemical route, a stronger chemical grafting occurs
at the TiO2/MWCNT interface.30 The SAED pattern of the NCs shows good ring patterns with lattice
points indicating crystallinity. The indexed ring designs closely
match with the spacing of the various reflections of the anatase phase.

The optical properties of NCs powders were studied through UV–visible
DRS spectra. Figure 5(a) includes UV–visible DRS spectra of bare TiO2 NPs and the representative TiO2/MWCNTs NCs. All samples
show the absorption edge between 382 and 400 nm due to the excitation
of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the TiO2 host material.29 With the increase
in MWCNTs content in TiO2, not only the absorption capability
but also the red shifting of the absorption edge of NCs are also observed.
This optical absorption behavior reveals the strong interaction between
the TiO2 and MWCNTs, which results in the enhancement of
surface electric charge of the TiO2 NPs by MWCNTs.

DRS spectra and (b) Kubelka–Munk function
(αhυ)1/2 as a function of
photon energy (hυ) of bare TiO2NPs
and representative T@0.01 C, T@0.10 C, and T@1.00 C NCs.

It is also beneficial for the ease of charge transfer
between TiO2 and MWCNTs and hence results in the enhancement
of light
absorption capability of TiO2 in the visible region, which
are excellent aspects for light-harvesting ability of the photoanode
material.31 To know the impact of varying
content of MWCNTs on the optical properties of TiO2, the
optical energy band gaps of all samples were determined. Optical energy
band gaps of all the representative samples were calculated by using
the Kubelka–Munk function (αhυ)1/2 (where α is the absorption coefficient) as a function
of photon energy (hυ), which is shown in Figure 5(b). The optical
energy band gap is recognized by plotting the intercept tangent to
the x-axis in a graph, decreased from 3.2 to 2.85
eV with an increase in the content of MWCNTs in TiO2 (Table 2) (Figure S7, SI). The calculated optical band gap is firm
evidence for the visible-light absorption by NCs as compared to bare
TiO2 NPs.

To study the electronic behavior as well as
separation of photogenerated
charge carrier trapping with the fate of excitons in the semiconductor
materials, the photoluminescence (PL) studies of the various materials
were investigated. The PL spectra of bare TiO2 NPs and
TiO2/MWCNTs NCs in the wavelength range between 450 and
650 nm are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Photoluminescence emission spectra of bare TiO2 NPs
and TiO2/MWCNTs NCs with varying content of MWCNTs.

The emission peaks appeared at
486 and 527 nm, corresponding to
the band–band emission and metal–nonmetal charge transfer
transitions by excitation wavelength at 365 nm (Figure S8, SI).32 With the increase
in the content of MWCNTs, the PL intensity of the respective emission
peaks decreases. The decreasing behavior of PL is attributed to reductions
in the radiative recombination of photoinduced electrons trapped at
the surface of TiO2 with the content of MWCNTs, and hence
NCs are best for the efficient charge separations. The detailed charge
separation and energy level diagram of the photoelectrode are shown
in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1,
SI).

FT-IR spectra of MWCNTs, bare TiO2 NPs, and
representative
NCs are shown in Figure 7. FT-IR spectrum of MWCNTs shows the peaks at 3440, 2925, 2845,
1740, 1632, 1383, and 1110 cm–1 corresponding to
the O–H stretching vibration, C–H stretching, C–OH
stretching, C=O stretching, O–H deformation vibrations,
and alkoxy C–O stretching vibrations, respectively.33,34

Figure 7 FT-IR
spectra of MWCNTs, bare TiO2 NPs, and representative
T@0.1 C and T@0.25 C NCs.

FT-IR spectra of TiO2 NPs or NCs show the broad
absorption
band from 3000 to 3400 cm–1 assigned to the –OH
stretching frequency vibration. The bands at the region 3000–3400
cm–1 broaden, with the content of MWCNTs, reflecting
the increase in surface hydroxylation of NCs. A band in the range
of 2925–2856 cm–1, analogous to the Ti–OH
stretching vibration, is shifted to the lower frequency region at
2820–2730 cm–1 in the TiO2/MWCNTs
NCs. The shifting is due to the −OH stretching frequency region
of the Ti precursor overlapping with the other contributions like
C=O, C–O, and O–C=O moieties of MWCNTs.23 Similarly, other peaks at 1374 cm–1 and 1590–1630 cm–1 in the NCs are also
shifted to the longer frequency region, which reveals the interaction
between the carboxylate groups of MWCNTs with the Ti precursors.30 The TiO2 NPs or NCs samples show
the broad peak in the range between 550 and 900 cm–1, due to the various stretching vibrations such as Ti–O, O–Ti–O,
Ti–O–C, and Ti–O–C=O.35

The chemical composition and the chemical
states on the surface
of the elements are studied by using EDAX, which is illustrated in
the Supporting Information (Figure S2,
SI) and XPS analysis shown in Figure 8. Figure 8(a) shows the high-resolution core level
spectrum of the Ti ion, and it consists of two peaks at 458.95 and
464.66 eV corresponding to Ti 2P3/2 and Ti 2P1/2 states, respectively. The difference in binding energy between the
two peaks (5.69 eV) corresponds to the Ti4+ state in the
octahedral environment of the anatase TiO2.36Figure 8(b) shows the high-resolution core-level XPS spectrum of oxygen
species. A major peak at 530.9 eV is due to the presence of lattice
oxygen in the sample and is deconvoluted into two peaks at 531.4 and
532.6 eV and analogous to the carbonyl (−C=O) or carboxylic
species from the TiO2/MWCNTs NC.29 The high-resolution C 1s core-level spectrum of the same sample
is shown in Figure 8(c). A major peak at 284.8 eV is due to the sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms, and it also deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.85,
285.26, 285.57, and 289.28 eV corresponding to the sp2-bonded
carbon atoms of C=C, C–O, C=O, and ester groups
(O–C=O), respectively. The existence of all these groups
is beneficial for making the chemical bond formation between the TiO2 lattice and MWCNTs, and the absence of the other peak at
281 eV indicates that elemental carbon is not doped in the TiO2 lattice.37

core-level spectra of T@0.1 C NCs powder.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis gives
the specific
surface area of the materials. Figure 9 shows the nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption
isotherms of bare TiO2 NPs, representative T@0.1 C, and
T@1.0 C NCs. The separation between the N2 adsorption–desorption
curves indicates that samples exhibit type IV isotherms.38 T@0.1 C NCs as well as bare TiO2 show
that the N2 adsorption rises abruptly due to the capillary
condensation of N2 and leading to the formation of type
H1 hysteresis loops. It also signifies the particles with spherical
pore geometry and a high degree of pore size uniformity, while in
the case of T@1.0 C NCs, the decrease in N2 adsorption
is observed due to the reduction in surface area and also improper
anchoring of TiO2 NPs on the surface of MWCNTs.39 The BET parameters of the samples are summarized
in Table 2.

Figure 9 N2 adsorption isotherms of bare TiO2 NPs
and representative T@0.1 C and T@1.0 C NCs.

The specific surface area of bare TiO2 is found
to be
90.27 m2/g, which is intermediate between the surface area
of T@0.1 C (109.85 m2/g) and T@1.0 C (60.42 m2/g) samples. Overall, it reveals that the least addition of MWCNTs
in the NCs increases the surface area to the TiO2 matrix
due to the proper anchoring of TiO2 on the surface of the
MWCNTs.40 In the design of the photoelectrode,
the N719 dye is directly anchored on the surface of the NCs thin films
through carboxylic groups of the N719 dye.41 However, due to the absence of carboxylic groups, RuPc is not directly
anchored to the surface of the NCs thin films. Therefore, isonicotinic
acid (INA) is used as a bridging ligand to connect RuPc with the surface
of the NCs thin films, and hence the overall connectivity of RuPc
with NCs through INA is similar to that of N719 dye. The bridging
role of INA is confirmed by measuring the absorption spectra of TiO2/MWCNTs with and without INA, which is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S9, SI). In comparison,
the optical absorption of the TiO2/MWCNTs/INA/RuPc photoelectrode
is higher than that without INA (TiO2/MWCNTs/RuPc). The
optical behavior powerfully reveals that INA binds steadily to both
dye and host materials, viz., the dye molecule through the pyridine
ring and TiO2/MWCNTs through carboxylic acid moieties (Scheme 1).

After anchoring with dyes, the photoanodes further characterized
by using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The UV–visible
absorption spectrum of the TiO2-MWCNTs/N719 photoelectrode
shows two characteristics absorption bands of N719 in the range 310–600
nm (Figure 10). The
first band appeared at 370 nm due to the π–π* transition
of the aromatic rings, and the second band is at 502 nm due to the
internal charge transfer transition.42 Similarly,
the TiO2/MWCNTs/INA/RuPc photoanode shows the characteristic
Q-band of RuPc at 650 nm, where the maximum solar photons occur.43 In addition to the Q-band, it also absorbs the
light to a small extent at the various regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The bands in UV–visible patterns are characteristic
absorptions of individual ingredients present in the photoelectrodes.

absorption spectra of TiO2/MWCNTs/N719
and TiO2/MWCNTs/INA/RuPc based photoanodes.

After that, the amount of N719 and RuPc dyes was
loaded on the
surface of the NCs thin films measured by desorbing a 1.0 cm2 area of the dye adsorbed thin films into the 5 mL aqueous 1 mM KOH
solution. It is evident from Figure 11(a) that the absorption spectra of N719 dye were detached
from the TiO2 NPs and representative NCs thin films. It
shows the two distinct absorption maxima at 370 and 500 nm, but the
actual N719 dye shows maximum absorption peaks at 380 and 518 nm.
The shifting to the 370 and 500 nm is due to the anchoring of the
N719 dye molecules on the surface of the NCs thin films.42 RuPc shows the absorption maxima at 650 nm [Figure 11(b)] due to the
characteristic Q-band. The quantification of dye adsorbed on the thin-film
surface is calculated from Figure 11(a and b) and illustrated in Table 2. The observed result shows the T@0.1 C NCs
photoelectrode having the maximum dye adsorption capability as compared
to the bare TiO2 NPs and other NCs thin films. It is fascinating
that the dye loading capacity of T@0.1 C NCs is higher as compared
to the bare TiO2 NPs and other NCs based photoelectrodes.
Hence, the high loading of dye offers the better harvesting of photons
in the visible range of dyes and will increase the photocurrent density
(Jsc) of the devices.

and (b) RuPc dyes detached from bare TiO2 and representative

The sensitized photoanodes were used for sandwich-type DSSCs
(Scheme
S1, SI) and further tested for photovoltaic
performance using a solar simulator under standard AM 1.5 one sun
illumination (100 mW/cm2) with an active area of 0.25 cm2. In addition to the assessment of the sensitizer’s
impact, the effect of MWCNTs on the photovoltaic properties of the
TiO2 host lattice with the N719-based DSSC device showed
different solar cell parameters. Figure 12(a,b) shows the current density–voltage
characteristic curves of the samples with N719 and RuPc dyes, respectively.

The different photovoltaic
parameters such as photocurrent density
(Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and light to electrical conversion
efficiency (η) of the DSSCs are represented in Table 3.

In the case of FTO/TiO2-MWCNTs/N719 DSSCs, the overall
highest power conversion efficiency of 6.21% is noted for T@0.1 C
NC-based DSSCs. This highest efficiency of T@0.1 C NC-based DSSCs
is also reflected through its highest values of Jsc (17.60 mA/cm2), Voc (0.630 V), and FF (56.08%). However, the Jsc value of other NC-based DSSCs varied from 11.24 to 15.50
mA/cm2 (Figure 13(b)). Specifically, the Jsc value
is increased up to T@0.1 C NC-based DSSCs, and after that, it decreased
to 11.24 mA/cm2 for T@1.0 C NC-based DSSCs, which is shown
in Table 3. It is also
interesting that the Jsc value of NC-based
DSSCs is higher than that of bare TiO2-based DSSCs. This
change in Jsc value of NCs or bare TiO2-based DSSCs is collinear with the change in surface area
of NCs as well as dye loading capacity of NC-based photoelectrodes
(Table 2). In addition,
the Jsc value of TiO2/MWCNTs/N719
DSSCs is higher than that of TiO2/MWCNTs/RuPc DSSCs; this
is attributed to the reasons such as connectivity between the host
material and dye and coverage of optical region. In the case of N719-based
DSSCs, the direct connectivity between N719 and TiO2/MWCNTs
is observed, while in RuPc-based DSSCs the INA acts as a bridging
ligand between TiO2/MWCNTs and dye. Though absorption is
higher for RuPc dye, the coverage region is small. Hence, the synergetic
effect of these factors is responsible for an improved charge-carrier
transport resulting in an increase in Jsc values of TiO2/MWCNTs/N719-based DSSCs.44

A plot of Voc as a function of
MWCNTs
composition in TiO2 is shown in Figure 13(c). It revealed that no significant change
is observed for Voc value in NC-based
DSSCs except T@0.1 C NC-based DSSCs. The Voc value of NC-based DSSCs is seen around 0.550 V, which
is still lower than that for bare TiO2-based DSSCs. The
lower photovoltage is attributed to the nearly same absorption edge
of the NC photoelectrodes, while in the case of FF value the change
is similar to that of Jsc as well as the
efficiency of DSSCs. Up to T@0.1 C NC-based DSSCs, the FF value increased
to 56% from 43%, and after that, it decreased for higher content of
MWCNTs in the TiO2 host lattice, which is shown in Figure 13(d). Moreover,
the efficiency of all NCs-based DSSCs is in the range of 2.99–6.21%,
which is three to six times more than that of bare TiO2-based DSSCs (1.04%) [Figure 12(a)]. From the photovoltaic analysis of TiO2/MWCNTs NCs with N719 dye sensitization, it is concluded that the
highest solar to electrical conversion efficiency is observed for
T@0.1 C NCs-based DSSCs, and hence, for further photovoltaic studies
with RuPc dye, only the T@0.1 C NCs-based photoelectrode is used.
In the case of RuPc, T@0.1 C NC-based DSSCs result in a power conversion
efficiency of 2.07%. The other photovoltaic parameters of T@0.1 C
NC-based DSSCs are Jsc (6.73 mA/cm2), Voc (0.580 V), and FF (53.24%).
Overall, the power conversion efficiency of the TiO2-based
DSSC device is low as compared to the TiO2/MWCNTs NC-based
DSSC device. In DSSCs, the excited electrons (LUMO) from the dye are
injected into the conduction band (LUMO) of TiO2 and finally
transferred into the counter electrode through two ways, namely, electric
field driven charge transport45 and a trap-limited
diffusion process.46 However, in bare TiO2 the electron transport is negligible because the diffusion
of electrons through the TiO2 network undergoes different
interfaces, and these interfaces act as electron trap centers, and
hence there is a possibile electron–hole pair recombination.47 However, in TiO2/MWCNTs NCs-based
DSSC device the MWCNTs acts as a carrier transporter with proper channels,
and hence it avoids the possibility of recombination; that is, it
minimizes the charge transport resistance of the device. Once the
excited electron from the dye is injected into the semiconductor,
it has an efficient pathway to reach the counter electrode through
MWCNTs, and hence it greatly enhances the photoresponse of the cell.48

In the end, with varying sensitizers,
the photovoltaic performance
of T@0.1 C NCs-based DSSCs is significantly higher. The power conversion
efficiency of T@0.1 C NCs/N719 DSSCs is almost three times more than
that of RuPc-based DSSCs, and hence the overall efficiency reaches
6.21% from either 1.04% of bare TiO2 with N719 or 0.07%
of bare TiO2 with RuPc. It is interesting that although
there is a resemblance in the connection of dyes with the surfaces
of TiO2-MWCNTs the conversion efficiency of DSSCs with
different dyes is different due to their optical absorption coverge.
Overall, the energy conversion efficiency of T@0.1 C NCs/N719 DSSCs
is higher than others (T@0.1 C NCs/RuPc, TiO2/N719, and
TiO2/RuPc DSSCs). Along with the surface area of the host
material, the higher efficiency is corelated to the well
coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum by N719-based DSSCs, resulting
in more absorption of light with the formation of efficient charge
carriers, which is responsible for the significant enhancement of
the conversion efficiency. The detailed absorption edge and absorption
strength of the two different sensitizer-based DSSCs is discussed
in the incident photon-to-charge carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE)
measurement.

The photovoltaic performances of the N719 and RuPc-based
DSSC devices
are confirmed by using IPCE at different incident wavelengths and
determined by using the following relation  where Jsc is the short-circuit current density: λ
is the wavelength
of the incident light; and Iinc is the power of the incident light.49Figure 14(a, b) shows the IPCE spectra for the N719- and RuPc-based DSSCs,
respectively. In the case of an N719 dye, the photocurrents for all
TiO2-MWCNT NC-based DSSCs are generated in the range from
300 to 650 nm. The two distinct regions (viz., 300–400 nm and
475–650 nm) are observed for current generations.

Figure 14 IPCE spectra
of bare TiO2 NPs and representative
NCs for (a) N719 and (b) RuPc-based DSSCs.

The former region is found due to the characteristic absorption
of TiO2 as well as the small extent of N719 dye, while
the latter is due to the high absorption of the N719 dye.23 The maximum IPCE value of TiO2/MWCNTs
NC-based DSSCs reached 47% for T@0.1 C NCs/N719-based DSSCs as compared
to others, which is also in good agreement with the observed maximum Jsc of the TiO2/MWCNT NCs-based DSSCs.
In comparison to bare TiO2-based DSSCs, the IPCE value
for T@0.1 C NCs-based DSSCs is 2.5 times higher. Similar to I–V characterization, the loading
of N719 dye and MWCNTs content in the TiO2 host lattice
enhances the optical properties of the TiO2 host lattice,
and it is better for the charge separation as well as the efficiency
of the cells.28 In the end, IPCE response
of T@0.1C NC with RuPc dye through INA was tested under the same operating
conditions. It shows the two distinct absorption maxima, viz., between
300 to 400 nm and 600 to 700 nm, for the conversion of solar to electrical
current. The first region is dominated due to the absorption of TiO2, and the second wide region is analogous to RuPc only, with
minimum absorption to that of the N719 dye. Overall, the IPCE value
of TiO2/MWCNTs NCs/N719 based DSSCs is almost three times
that of the TiO2/MWCNTs NCs/INA/RuPc-based DSSCs. Because
through carboxylic functional groups N719 is covalently connected
to the surface of the TiO2/MWCNTs NCs, the connectivity
of the different moieties results in the high absorption capacity
of the cells. Due to the absence of carboxylic functional moieties,
RuPc was anchored on host materials through INA, but it may also build
up the resistivity of the cells and hence decrease the overall conversion
efficiency of the RuPc-based DSSCs. The lower power conversion efficiency
confirms that, along with MWCNTs content, the proper connectivity
between the dye and MWCNTs plays a dominant role in capturing as much
incident light as possible by its absorption strength with host semiconducting
material and overlaps that possible absorption with the solar spectrum.

Conclusions
Thin films of TiO2/MWCNT NCs were successfully deposited
on FTO-glass substrate using a binder-free doctor blade technique.
The anchoring of TiO2 NPs to the surfaces of MWCNTs was
confirmed by using HRTEM, FT-IR, Raman, and XPS analysis. With varying
MWCNTs content in NCs, the structural parameters of the TiO2 host lattice were varied, which was also confirmed by Rietveld refinement
studies (goodness of fit = ∼1.5). The optical absorption edge
of TiO2 extended toward the red region of the electromagnetic
spectrum with MWCNTs, and the optical energy band gap of samples turned
from 3.2 to 2.85 eV. The TiO2/MWCNTs NCs are anchored with
two different Ru(II)-based dyes, viz., N719 and RuPc, and these electrodes
were used as photoanodes for efficient DSSCs. The different absorption
and anchoring nature of sensitizers directly affected the solar energy
power conversion efficiency of the devices. Among all devices, T@0.1C
NCs with N719-based devices showed the highest Jsc, Voc, FF, and η (6.21%)
as that of either other CNTs-based devices or the RuPc-based DSSCs
device (η = 2.07%). The same materials were utilized toward
the fabrication of solid-state DSSCs (using either p-type inorganic
or p-type organic semiconductors as HTMs), and works are in progress
in our lab.

Experimental Section
The commercial pristine MWCNTs
were functionalized with the acid
treatment method,50 and bare TiO2 NPs were synthesized by an earlier reported sol–gel method
with slight modifications.51 The phthalocyanine
(Pc) based Ru(II) complex (RuPc) was prepared by using a literature
method with some modifications.52 The detailed
experimental conditions of all these materials have been provided
in the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of
TiO2/MWCNTs Nanocomposites (NCs)
An in
situ sol–gel method was used for synthesizing
TiO2/MWCNT NCs with varying content of MWCNTs. The functionalized
MWCNTs were dispersed in deionized water (DW) using an ultrasonicator
bath, and these MWCNTs were added directly during the synthesis of
the TiO2 NPs route after hydroxylation of titanium precursors.
The blackish colored precipitate formed and was subsequently washed,
dried, and annealed at 753 K for 2 h. The different contents of MWCNTs
such as 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 0.25, and 1.0 wt % were added to the titanium
precursor, and then these samples are designated as T@0.01 C, T@0.05
C, T@0.1 C, T@0.25 C, and T@1.0 C, respectively.

Fabrication
of DSSCs with TiO2/MWCNTs Photoanodes
Binder-free
NCs were deposited on FTO glass electrode using the
doctor-blade technique. Primarily, FTO glass substrates were washed
thoroughly with water (with detergent), acetone, and finally in ethanol
using an ultrasonicator bath. The cleaned glass substrates were annealed
at 373 K for 30 min. The NC powders were ultrasonically dispersed
in both N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
and acetonitrile (ACN) for 1 h and 30 min, respectively, and the upper
organic layer was decanted. The remaining portion was stirred continuously
to form slurry. This slurry was deposited on a cleaned FTO glass substrate
using the doctor-blade method, and these films were sintered at 723
K for 2 h. The deposited thin films were sensitized using, namely,
N719 and RuPc dyes separately. In sensitization protocol, thin films
were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 dye solution (1:1 mixture of tert-butyl alcohol and ACN) for 18 h (room temp). The unbound
dye was removed from the film after rinsing twice in a combination
of tert-butyl alcohol and acetonitrile. The N719
dye-anchored photoelectrode was sandwiched between the platinum counter
electrode (Pt/ITO) using 60 μm thick sealing Surlyn sheet. Finally,
the electrolyte (1.0 M LiI + 0.06 M I2 in propylene carbonate)
was impregnated and sealed (Scheme 1). The photovoltaic performance of the devices (with
an active area of 0.25 cm2) was measured by the current–voltage
(IV) and IPCE spectra. Similarly, the photovoltaic
performance of the sandwich-type DSSCs with TiO2/MWCNTs
(T@0.1 C) photoelectrode, sensitized with RuPc dye, was also measured.
