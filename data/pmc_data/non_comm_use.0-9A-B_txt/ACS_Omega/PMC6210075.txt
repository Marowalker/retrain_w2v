Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
is responsible for regulating
concentrations of the endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide. Multiple
FAAH inhibitors have been developed for clinical trials and have failed
to demonstrate efficacy at treating pain, despite promising preclinical
data. One approach toward increasing the efficacy of FAAH inhibitors
is to concurrently inhibit other targets responsible for regulating
pain. Here, we designed dual inhibitors targeting the enzymes FAAH
and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which are targets previously
shown to synergize at reducing inflammatory and neuropathic pain.
Exploration of the sEH/FAAH inhibitor structure–activity relationship
started with PF-750, a FAAH inhibitor (IC50 = 19 nM) that weakly inhibited sEH (IC50 = 640 nM). Potency
was optimized resulting in an inhibitor with improved potency on both
targets (11, sEH IC50 = 5 nM, FAAH IC50 = 8 nM). This inhibitor demonstrated good target selectivity,
pharmacokinetic properties (AUC = 1200 h nM, t1/2 = 4.9 h in mice), and in vivo target engagement.

==== Body
Introduction
The endocannabinoid
system is an attractive target for anti-inflammatory
and analgesic therapeutics. It maintains physiologic homeostasis through
two receptors, the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2), that are activated primarily by two endocannabinoids, arachidonoyl
ethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Agonists directly
targeting these receptors, including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
may be useful as analgesics but can cause motor impairment and prevent
daily function.1 By comparison, increasing
concentrations of endocannabinoids by targeting their hydrolytic metabolism
is an alternative approach for producing the same therapeutic effect
with reduced side effects. Inhibition or genetic deletion of fatty
acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme primarily responsible for
regulating AEA, has been efficacious in numerous experimental rodent
models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain with no functional impairment.2−4

Several types of FAAH inhibitors have been designed. Most
inhibit
either by interacting with catalytic serine by forming reversible
transition-state mimics, such as α-ketoheterocycles,5,6 or through irreversible carbamoylation, such as carbamates7,8 or trisubstituted ureas.4,9−11 Both mechanisms are general for serine hydrolases, and thus, the
medicinal chemistry of FAAH inhibitors has focused on optimizing target
selectivity in addition to potency. In the case of the FAAH inhibitor
BIA 10-2474, off-target inhibition coupled with relatively low potency
was the potential cause of a human fatality during phase I clinical
trials.12,13 By comparison, PF-04457845, a highly potent
FAAH inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile had no observed
side effects but was unable to produce efficacy in phase II osteoarthritic
pain trials.14,15 Although there may be therapeutic
potential for FAAH inhibitors for other indications, no other clinical
studies studying FAAH inhibition on pain have demonstrated biological
efficacy in human.16

One approach
toward improving biological efficacy, and thus enhancing
their therapeutic potential, is to combine inhibitors of multiple
targets into a single therapy. Several multitarget inhibitors/modulators
have been proposed for FAAH inhibition, including cyclooxygenase (COX),17,18 monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL),19 cytosolic
phospholipase A2,20,21 and the dopamine 3 receptor.22 When FAAH and COX inhibition were combined,
the resulting drug not only improves the potency relative to targeting
a single molecule but also reduces gastrointestinal side effects associated
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.17 In addition to these targets, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) similarly
synergizes with FAAH to improve potency on both inflammatory and neuropathic
models of pain.23 Soluble epoxide hydrolase
regulates biologically active epoxy-fatty acids, including epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids, through conversion to their less active diols.24,25 Although the mechanism of synergy between sEH and FAAH is poorly
understood, this efficacy is possibly mediated through epoxy-fatty
ethanolamides (EpFEAs), CB2 receptor agonists that
are likely metabolized by both FAAH and sEH.26,27 In support of this hypothesis, the analgesic effect of sEH inhibitors
alone is partially blocked by CB2 but not CB1 antagonists.28

Previously, we reported
dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors that were potent
on human forms of either enzymes but were unsuitable for use in experimental
rodent models.29 Here, we sought to design
new dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors that could be used in experimental in
vivo models. These inhibitors were designed by integrating a urea
pharmacophore common to the medicinal chemistry of both sEH and FAAH
inhibitors.

Chemistry and Structure Activity Relationship
The design
for potent FAAH and sEH inhibitors is well characterized
and described in several recent reviews.30−32 Both FAAH and
sEH inhibitors utilize urea pharmacophores to obtain compounds with
nM potencies (Figure 1A).4,9−11,33−35 Between these two targets, the urea functional group
plays a different role in the mechanism of inhibition. Urea-based
sEH inhibitors satisfy hydrogen bonds between H-donating tyrosine
residues and the catalytic aspartate residue, resulting in reversible
transition-state mimics.36,37 Disubstituted urea
inhibitors generally have the highest potency, but highly potent amide,
trisubstituted urea, and carbamate inhibitors have been described
also.31 The amide-based GSK2256294A has
sub-nM potency and has been developed through phase I clinical trials.38 By comparison, urea-based FAAH inhibitors form
a covalent intermediate by carbamoylating the catalytic serine residue.
Two criteria are critical for this activity: (1) one of the urea nitrogens
must carry an aromatic group that becomes a leaving group after nucleophilic
attack, and (2) the other nitrogen must bear a heterocycle group (such
as a piperidine or piperazine) that provides strain on the molecule.9,39,40 This carbamoylating reaction
is relatively unique to FAAH over other serine hydrolases; thus, these
inhibitors have high selectivity for FAAH.

sEH, FAAH, and dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors
that were used to optimize newly reported dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors.
FAAH enzyme preincubation times are reported next to IC50 values. Publications with reported values indicated next to compound
name. (B) General approach for the design of dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors. (Ahn
et al., 2007,1 Johnson et al., 2010,2 Ahn et al., 2009,3 Keith et al., 2008,4 Kodani et al., 2018,5 Hwang et al., 2007,6 Rose et al., 2010,7 Podolin et al., 2013,8).

Given the structural overlap between FAAH and sEH inhibitors,
we
speculated that optimization of current FAAH inhibitors could be used
to develop dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors. To investigate this possibility,
the potency of several commercially available FAAH inhibitors was
measured on human sEH and FAAH enzymes (Table 1). These inhibitors have been well described
in the literature with nM potency, and some have been used in rodent
models of pain and other disease.4,9,10,41PF-750 had the highest potency toward sEH with an IC50 of 360
nM. From this initial structure, we sought to rationally design an
inhibitor with improved potency toward both enzymes by modifying the
portion of the molecule that is removed by FAAH (here termed the “leaving
group”) and the portion of the molecule that covalently forms
a carbamate intermediate with the FAAH active site (here termed the
“carbomoylating group”) (Figure 1B).

a sEH IC50 was measured
using CMNPC ([S]final = 5 μM) in
sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 7.4, 0.1 mg/mL BSA).

b FAAH IC50 was measured
using OMP ([S]final = 100 μM) in
sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 8.0, 0.1 mg/mL BSA).

On the basis of previous SAR studies
of sEH and FAAH inhibition,
we observed the effect of various substitutions on this aromatic
“leaving group” has opposite effects on improving the
potency of these two targets.11,35 To test the hypothesis
that sEH and FAAH potency could be balanced by modifying the carbamoylating
and leaving groups, a series of compounds were synthesized where the
carbamoylating group from PF-750 was kept the same and
the aromatic leaving group was modified. All molecules were synthesized
based on a modification of previously described methods (Scheme 1).9,42 The
boc-protected 4-substituted piperidines were synthesized by cross-coupling
using a Pd catalyst and deprotected under acidic conditions. The final
urea was generated by reacting the secondary amine with the commercially
available aromatic isocyanate.

Scheme 1 Reagents and Conditions: (a) t-Butyl–Methylenepiperidine-1-carboxylate,
9-BBN, Pd(dppf)Cl2, K2CO3, 5:1 DMF/H2O; (b) K2CO3, Phenylacyl Bromide, DMF,
110 °C, Overnight; (c) 2 N HCl in MeOH, 60 °C, 2 h; (d)
R4-CNO, THF, Overnight; and (e) R4-Phenyl Carbamate,
DIPEA, DMSO, 55 °C
Substitution of the leaving group resulted in opposite
effects
on potency toward sEH and FAAH comparable to previously reported SAR
(Table 2).11,35 The unsubstituted ring was modified to add fluorine (1) and chlorine (2) in the 4 position. This increased
activity toward sEH 7- and 30-fold, respectively, and decreased activity
toward FAAH 5- and 3-fold. Addition of fluorine to the 2 position
(3) decreased potency 3-fold toward FAAH while maintaining
low potency of sEH compared to PF-750. Altering the aromatic
group to have a 4-trifluoromethoxy (4) improved sEH potency
80-fold, whereas also reducing FAAH potency by 21-fold. In comparison,
4-methoxy (5) had a 5-fold increase in potency toward
sEH without any change in the potency on FAAH. The 3-pyridine-substituted
inhibitor (6) had very little potency toward sEH, but
maintained high potency toward FAAH.

Table 2 Effect
of Modification of the “Leaving
Group” from PF-750 on sEH and FAAH Potency
To investigate
the contribution of the carbamoylating group to
the sEH SAR, we tested several carbamoylating groups from previously
described FAAH inhibitors while keeping the 4-methoxy leaving group
constant (Table 3).
The synthesis of most of these used the same cross-coupling reactions
as 1–6 with the exception of 10, in which the piperidine was generated by cyclization between
2-bromoacetophenone and N-boc-4-aminothiocarbonylpiperidine
to form the corresponding thiazole.43 Modification
of 3-quinoline (5) to 3-phenyl-thiazole (10) resulted in a loss of potency toward both targets, and modification
to 2-quinoline (7) resulted in a loss of potency toward
sEH with no change in potency toward FAAH. Although the thiazole was
used instead of the thiadiazole, previous studies indicate that this
change does not impact potency toward FAAH.43 Modification to the 2-naphthylene (8) or 2-phenoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine
(9) increased activity toward FAAH (4-fold and 30-fold,
respectively) without sacrificing potency toward sEH. Because of its
high FAAH potency, the 2-phenoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine group
was used to further optimize the leaving group.

Table 3 Effect of Modification of the “Carbamoylating
Group” on sEH and FAAH Potency
Combining the sEH potent
4-trifluoromethoxy aniline with the 2-(3-(piperidin-4-ylmethyl)phenoxy)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine
leaving group (11) resulted in a potent inhibitor for
both enzymes (sEH IC50 = 5 nM, FAAH IC50 = 8
nM). We further tested whether additional substitutions in the leaving
group could improve potency (Table 4). For 14–18, the
corresponding isocyanate was not commercially available, so a phenyl
carbamate generated using phenyl chloroformate was used instead. Using
the 4-chloro (12) resulted in a slightly less potent
inhibitor on sEH (4-fold reduction). The 4-trifluoromethyl (13) was not substantially different from 11.
Adding nitrogen in either the 2 position (15) or the
3 position (14) of the ring reduced sEH potency 12- to
14-fold while either reducing (15) or improving (14) FAAH potency 3-fold. Modification to the pyridazine (16) or the 3,4-dimethyl-isoxazole (17), both
potent substitutions on FAAH,10 dramatically
decreased potency toward sEH. Additionally, adding fluorine in the
2 position (18) had minor changes on potency in both
enzymes (<3-fold difference). It should be noted that the large
difference in potencies on sEH with minor modifications in the leaving
groups (2400-fold between 11 and PF-3845) is consistent with previous SARs and is likely due to an inability
for the sEH active site to accommodate hydrophilic inhibitors.35

of the “Leaving
Group” from PF-3845 on sEH and FAAH Potency
Species Selectivity
Although human recombinant enzymes were used for understanding
the structure activity relationships on both FAAH and sEH, most experimental
models for testing biological efficacy are in rodents. Because PF-3845 is less potent on rodent FAAH than on human FAAH,4 we expected the potency of all of the new inhibitors
on rat and mouse FAAH to be reduced relative to their potency on human
FAAH (Table 5). All
of the dual inhibitors had IC50 values >10 000
nM
on rat enzyme. On the mouse enzyme, 11 and 14 had IC50 values of 1400 and 560 nM, respectively, whereas 13 and 18 had IC50 values >10 000
nM. As expected, increasing the preincubation time increased the potency
of all inhibitors in both species while maintaining the relative rank
in potency between inhibitors.

a All IC50 values were

The potency on sEH is similarly
reduced in both rat and mouse for
all inhibitors tested. However, compared to the >100-fold difference
between species on FAAH, the species difference on sEH ranged from
4-fold to 40-fold. The best compound in this series, 11, had a better rodent potency than the reference sEH inhibitor TPPU; thus, it is unlikely that differences in potency on
sEH would limit the use of this compound for sEH inhibition.

Kinetics
of Inhibition
IC50s with a short (5 min) preincubation
are a relatively
close approximation of affinity for characterizing the SAR of dual
sEH/FAAH inhibitors. However, many groups have argued that defining
enzyme kinetics more accurately predicts the in vivo pharmacodynamics.10,41 For irreversible FAAH inhibition, these values include the inhibitor
association constant (Ki), the rate constant
for covalent inactivation (kinact), and
the rate constant for enzyme reactivation (kreact). To define kinact and Ki constants, an experimental design was used
that was originally described by Main44 and subsequently used for the characterization of FAAH inhibitors
(Figure S1A, Table 5).10,41 This approach concurrently
adds the enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor and measures the rate of
change of substrate hydrolysis. The observed rate of enzyme inactivation
(kobs) is plotted against multiple inhibitor
concentrations to derive the Ki and kinact. Between PF-3845, 11, 13, 14, and 18, there was
relatively little variation between the kinact values (within 1.8-fold between PF-3845 and 11) and most of the variation was in the Ki (22-fold between PF-3845 and 11). This
indicates that the difference between inhibitors is mostly in their
affinity for the active site rather than the ability to form a covalent
intermediate.

In addition to the rate of reactivation (kreact), the rate of dissociation (koff) and the corresponding length of target occupancy
on the enzyme
(t1/2) contribute to the overall in vivo
potency of the inhibitor. Previous experiments with PF-3845, which result in the same carbamate intermediate as 11, demonstrate that the kreact of the
catalytic serine residue on the FAAH enzyme is such that the target
occupancy is at least several hours.4 To
determine the rate of reversible dissociation on the sEH enzyme, a
FRET-based assay was used in which 100-fold excess of a high affinity
fluorescent reporter was added to a solution of the enzyme–inhibitor
complex (1:1 molar equivalent) and the rate of inhibitor dissociation
was measured as the rate of FRET generated by the formation of the
enzyme–reporter complex.34,45 Compared to TPPU, which had a half-life on the enzyme (t1/2) of 8.3 min in this study, 11 and 13 had
a similar half-life at 11.8 and 9.9 min, respectively, and 14 and 18 had lower half-lives at 2.0 and 4.4 min, respectively
(Table 5). Because
the target occupancy of these compounds on both sEH and FAAH is comparable
to their respective reference inhibitors (TPPU and PF-3845), a similar pharmacodynamic profile is expected in
vivo.

A poorly explored challenge to the design of dual modulators
is
the relative preference between the two targets in vivo. In an isolated
system such as the recombinant enzyme assays used in this study, the
two targets are treated equally and independently. In vivo, these
two targets are unlikely to be equivalent because of differences in
the target abundance of competing substrates or differences in the
relative occupancy on the target. We speculate that the kinetics of
inhibition for 11 on sEH and FAAH targets avoids these
issues with intertarget dynamics. The target occupancy of 11 on both sEH and FAAH enzymes is comparable to the corresponding
single-target inhibitors but is substantially longer on FAAH than
on sEH (>10×). By comparison, the relative potency of 11 on mouse sEH (IC50 = 27 nM) is 52-fold greater
than FAAH
(IC50 = 1400 nM). This trade-off between target occupancy
and potency could likely result in good in vivo activity on both targets
that could be compromised if target occupancy was longer on sEH or
if potency was higher on FAAH.

Pharmacokinetics
To test whether
these dual inhibitors could be viable tools to
use in experimental rodent models, pharmacokinetic analysis was performed
in mice and rats. Cassette dosing has been used previously to characterize
and compare the pharmacokinetics of multiple similar sEH inhibitors.46 Cassette dosing was used here to compare the
pharmacokinetics of 11, 13, 14, and 18 and to identify the best inhibitor for further
studies (1 mg/kg, p.o. in PEG400). All four inhibitors had relatively
comparable PK profiles in both species (Figure 2, Table 6). The tmax for all inhibitors
in both animals was 4 h and the Cmax ranged
from 37 to 140 nM. The t1/2 ranged from
4.9 to 8.9 h and the AUC ranged from 410 to 2200 nM h. Between the
two species, 14 had the best AUC, 18 had
the worst AUC, and 11 and 13 had intermediate
values. On the basis of this profile, 11 was the only
inhibitor to reach a blood concentration within the IC50 of sEH inhibition in both species by 2 h postdosing and last within
this range at least 8 h postdosing.

by cassette dosing. Rats
(n = 4) or mice (n = 4) were dosed
with a cocktail of inhibitors (1 mg/kg each inhibitor, p.o., in PEG300)
and sampled at given intervals by tail vein collection. Results are
represented as averages of the group.

a Mice or rats were dosed with 1 mg/kg
of a cocktail of inhibitors by oral gavage (formulated in PEG300),
and blood was collected at intervals indicated in the methods. Pharmacokinetic
parameters were determined using PKSolver. Curves were fit to a noncompartmental
extravascular model using a linear trapezoidal method for quantifying
the area under the curve (AUC). Values were calculated using data
up to 24 h postdosing.

Solubility
is a major limitation to the described compounds that
likely accounts for the long absorption time (tmax ≈ 4 h). Between the inhibitors, 11 had
the worst water solubility (0.13 nM) (Table 5) which made it near impossible to dose by
any route of administration in any water-based solution. Solubility
of 11 was also tested in a variety of vehicles for in
vivo dosing (Table S3). Because of the
high solubility, a minimal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dosed
by i.p. administration was used for further in vivo experiments.

In
Vivo Target Engagement
On the basis of the balance of sEH/FAAH
potency and pharmacokinetics,
compound 11 was chosen for further exploration for in
vivo target engagement. On the basis of its potency toward FAAH (Table 5), 11 should have low in vivo activity on FAAH inhibition in rodents.
However, the irreversible mechanism of inhibition may result in greater
inhibition of the enzyme than would be predicted by in vitro assays.
Thus, the residual enzyme activities of FAAH and sEH were determined
4 h after dosing mice with 11 and compared to TPPU and PF-3845 (Figure 3). Activity was quantified in liver to determine target
engagement in normal tissues and in the brain to determine ability
to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. To measure FAAH activity,
the same fluorescent substrate from the SAR [N-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)octanamide
(OMP)] was used. Because of the reversible nature of sEH inhibitors,
we used [3H]-JHIII as a low activity substrate47 to reduce the dilution of enzyme, and thus of
the inhibitor, required for measuring sEH activity in the steady-state
range. On the basis of the large dilution required (>20-fold) in
the
liver due to the high abundance of sEH, this sEH assay was only tested
in the brain tissue of dosed animals. Dosing mice with a relatively
high dose of TPPU (10 mg/kg) did not alter residual FAAH
activity, as expected, but did reduce brain sEH activity to 22 ±
8% of the vehicle-treated activity. PF-3845 (1 mg/kg)
reduced liver and brain FAAH activity to 22 ± 2 and 0.2 ±
0.1% of the control values, respectively. Interestingly, PF-3845 also reduced apparent sEH activity to 63 ± 14% of the control.
On the basis of the low potency of PF-3845 on murine
sEH (IC50 = 1200 nM), it is unlikely that this reduction
is due to direct action on sEH but through some other unknown mechanism.
By comparison, 11 (10 mg/kg) appeared to reduce liver
FAAH to 22 ± 2% of control, similar to PF-3845,
but was not as efficient at inhibiting brain FAAH with 22 ± 15%
of the activity remaining. 11 appeared to marginally
reduce brain sEH to 61 ± 12% of control. A dose response of 11 ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg demonstrated >60% FAAH inhibition
even at the lowest dose tested (Figure S2).

Figure 3 In vivo target engagement of 11 on sEH and FAAH enzyme
in liver and brain. Mice were dosed with either vehicle (20 μL
DMSO), TPPU (10 mg/kg), PF-3845 (1 mg/kg),
or 11 (10 mg/kg) by i.p. injection and sacrificed 4 h
after dosing. Residual FAAH activity was measured fluorescently with
a OMP ([S] = 100 μM), and sEH activity was
measured radiometrically using [3H]JHIII ([S] = 5 μM). Results are represented as averages ± standard
deviation. *p < 0.05 from vehicle control (n = 4).

Off-Target Selectivity
Many serine hydrolase inhibitors suffer from poor target selectivity
because of their common mechanisms of action.48 Thus, to test whether 11 broadly inhibited serine hydrolases
or whether the inhibition is selective to FAAH, activity-based protein
profiling (ABPP) was used on both mouse brain and liver tissue homogenate
(Figure S4).9,48 This technique
uses a rhodamine-labeled fluorophosphonate probe that tags serine
hydrolase enzymes, which are then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized
using a Cy3 filter.4911, 13, 14, and 18 were compared with
two commonly used inhibitors, URB597 and PF-3845. URB597 is known to target a number of other hydrolases
including carboxylesterase 2.4,9,50 By comparison, PF-3845 is considered as a highly selective
inhibitor of FAAH.4 This selectivity is
based on the relatively unique ability of FAAH to hydrolyze urea inhibitors
because of a distorted amide bond when in complex with FAAH that increases
the reactivity of the urea.9,39 In mouse brain tissue,
the intensity of the FAAH band is reduced by URB597 and PF-3845 and no other bands were reduced by any of the inhibitors.
Although 11, 13, 14, and 18 does not appear to fully inhibit the band corresponding
to FAAH, this may be due to the low apparent potency of these inhibitors
on the mouse enzyme. In the mouse liver tissue, URB597 reduced the intensity of a band around 62.5 kDa (corresponding to
carboxylesterase enzyme), whereas neither 11, 13, 14, 18, nor PF-3845 had
any effect on the intensity of other bands. In addition to using ABPP
to compare selectivity, the IC50 in several recombinant
human enzyme preparations was compared between 11, URB597, and PF-3845 (Table S3). Both 11 and PF-3845 weakly inhibited
human CES2 (IC50 = 560 and 1100 nM, respectively, 5 min
IC50) and did not inhibit any other tested enzyme. By comparison, URB597 inhibited human CES1, CES2, and AADAC with IC50’s ranging from 39 to 190 nM. Thus, compared to URB597, the series of inhibitors described herein are highly selective
for FAAH over other serine hydrolases.

Conclusions
Here,
we described a series of dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors with 11 as the optimized structure (human sEH IC50 =
5 nM, human FAAH IC50 = 8 nM). Our previous attempt to
design dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors (A-24, Figure 1A)29 resulted in compounds that were potent on both enzymes in human
(sEH IC50 = 3.5 nM, FAAH IC50 = 24 nM) but only
potent on sEH in rodent species (mouse: sEH IC50 = 5.7,
FAAH IC50 = 350 nM; rat: sEH IC50 = 54 nM, FAAH
IC50 = 1700 nM). 11 similarly has reduced
potency on rodent FAAH (5 min mouse IC50 = 1400 nM), but
the irreversible nature of this inhibition results in a higher in
vitro potency with longer incubation times (60 min mouse IC50 = 66 nM) which results in effective in vivo target engagement. Furthermore,
on the basis of the high selectivity for FAAH over other serine hydrolase
inhibitors and excellent pharmacokinetic properties, we expect 11 to be a suitable tool for studying dual sEH/FAAH inhibition
in experimental rodent models.

The inhibitors described here
will be useful for exploring therapeutic
benefits of dual sEH/FAAH inhibition. Given that dual sEH/FAAH inhibition
likely modulates EpFEAs that activate the CB2 receptor, 11 may be useful in multiple indications where the CB2 receptor is a major target, including in the regulation of
energy homeostasis51−53 and the regulation of organ damage response and fibrosis.54

Methods
General Synthetic Procedures
and Methods
Solvents and
reagents were used without purification from commercial sources. For 1H and 13C NMR analysis, either a 300 MHz Varian
Mercury, 400 Bruker AVANCE, or 600 MHz Varian VNMRS spectrometer was
used. Analysis of the high-resolution mass spectra was performed using
a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL with the following settings:
centroid mode, spray voltage: 4.5 kV, capillary temperature: 275 °C,
sheath gas: 15. Melting point was determined using the Optimelt Automated
Melting Point System. Purity was checked by measuring the quenching
of green fluorescence indicator (λabs = 254 nm) on
thin-layer chromatography and confirmed using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with an Agilent 1200 Infinity LC system on a
Luna C18 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm particle size, 100
Å pore size). The solvent gradient for HPLC is as follows (A
= 0.1% formic acid in water; B = 0.1% formic acid in ACN): 0–2
min—90:10 A/B, 2–15—90:10 to 2:98 A/B, 15–21—2:98
A/B, 21–22—2:98 to 90:10 A/B, 22–25—90:10
A/B. Percent purity is reported based on UV absorption at λabs = 250 nm. The general procedures for the synthesis of the
described inhibitors are described below, and detailed procedures
and characterization are described in the Supporting Information.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Boc-Protected
Piperidines
(General Procedure A)
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-methylenepiperidine-1-carboxylate (1 equiv) in THF (10 mL)
was added a 0.5 M solution of 9-BBN in THF (1.05 equiv). After stirring
an hour, the solution was added to a preprepared solution of the corresponding
bromines (1.2 equiv), potassium carbonate (1 equiv), and Pd(dppf)Cl2 complexed with dichloromethane (0.05 equiv) in a 5:1 solution
of DMF/H2O (50 mL). The solution was heated to 60 °C
and allowed to stir overnight. The reaction was quenched by the addition
of 1 M NaOH, extracted with EtOAc, and dried over NaSO4. The product was run on a column of hexane/EtOAc with a gradient
from 8:2 to 6:4, yielding the product.

General Procedure for Boc
Deprotection (General Procedure B)
The corresponding boc-protected
piperidine was dissolved in 2 N
HCl in MeOH (30 mL) and was heated to 60 °C for 2 h. The excess
MeOH was removed by a rotary evaporator and diluted with H2O (30 mL), and the solution was treated with NaOH pellets to reach
pH = 11. The product was extracted with EtOAc, dried over NaSO4, and evaporated to afford the product.

General Procedure
for Urea Synthesis through an Isocyanate (1–13) (General Procedure C)
The
corresponding isocyanate (1.2 equiv) was added to a solution of the
corresponding amine (1 equiv) dissolved in dry THF (10 mL) and stirred
overnight. The reaction was quenched with 1 N HCl (10 mL) and stirred
for 5 min. The reaction was neutralized by addition of Na2CO3 and extracted three times with EtOAc. The product
was further purified by flash chromatography to afford the product.

General Procedure for Urea Synthesis through a Carbamate (14–18) (General Procedure D)
The corresponding
amine (1 equiv), phenyl carbamate (1.2 equiv),
and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine
(1.2 equiv) were dissolved in DMSO (15 mL). After stirring overnight
at 55 °C, the reaction was quenched with water and stirred for
5 min. The crude mixture was extracted with EtOAc, dried with Na2CO3, and evaporated. The product was purified by
flash chromatography.

Preparation of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase
(sEH) and FAAH Enzyme
Extracts
Recombinant mouse, rat, and human sEH were prepared
as previously described29 using an insect
cell/baculovirus system and affinity-based purification (purity >
95% as judged by SDS-PAGE) that removes all measurable esterase or
glutathione-S-transferase activity.55

Recombinant FAAH enzyme from baculovirus was prepared
as previously described.29,56 Briefly, homogenized
(3 × 15 s) baculovirus-infected high five cells were centrifuged
(9000g, 20 min) to collect the S9 fraction which
was resuspended in buffer (50 mM tris/HCl buffer, pH = 8.0) containing
1 mM CHAPS and 10% glycerol and stored frozen (−80 °C)
until use. For measuring rat FAAH inhibition, brain microsomes were
prepared by homogenizing tissue in phosphate buffer [20 mM, pH = 7.4,
5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)], collecting the S9 fraction
by centrifugation (9000g, 20 min), and further centrifuging
the S9 fraction at 100 000g for 1 h. The subsequent
microsomes were resuspended in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4,
2.5 mM EDTA) containing 20% glycerol and stored frozen (−80
°C) until use. For measuring mouse FAAH inhibition, crude tissue
homogenate was prepared in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH = 7.4, 5 mM
EDTA) and stored frozen (−80 °C) until use.

Measurement
of Inhibitor Potency Using Fluorescent Assays
Methods for
the quantification of inhibitor potencies have been
previously published for sEH,35,57,58 FAAH,29,59 and other esterases,55,60 and the individual details are described below. Generally, fluorescence
generated by enzymatic hydrolysis was quantified every 30 s for 10
min, and the reaction velocity (vinhibitor) was determined from the linear portion of the curve. Values were
subtracted from background using wells containing no enzyme. The IC50 values were derived using simple linear regression of the
log [I] versus % remaining activity (vinhibitor/vDMSO) and determining x when y = 0.50. All measurements were
the average of triplicates. For all assays, the final DMSO concentration
was 2%.

sEH Assay
The substrate cyano(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)methyl((3-phenyloxiran-2-yl)methyl)carbonate
(CMNPC) ([S]final = 5 μM) was added
to wells containing sEH in sodium phosphate buffer [0.1 M, pH = 7.4
and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)], and formation of the fluorescent
6-methoxynaphthaldehyde (λexcitation = 330 nm, λemission = 465 nm, 30 °C) was measured.

FAAH Assay
The substrate OMP ([S]final = 100 μM)
was added to wells containing FAAH in
sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 8, 0.1 mg/mL BSA), and formation
of the fluorescent 6-methoxypyridine (λexcitation = 303 nm, λemission = 394 nm, 37 °C) was measured.

For measuring Ki and kinact, OMP ([S]final = 100
μM) was added to various inhibitor concentrations and the mixture
was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Crude enzyme was then added
to the well, and the generation of fluorescent signal was immediately
monitored over 5 min. The value of kobs was calculated by the following equation  and kobs was fit
to  to calculate Ki and kobs.

Esterase
Assay
CES1, CES2, and AADAC crude recombinant
enzyme extracts were prepared as previously described.29 To measure esterase activity, the substrate
cyano(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)methyl acetate ([S]final = 50 μM) was added to wells containing either
CES1, CES2, or AADAC in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 8, 0.1
mg/mL BSA) and formation of the fluorescent 6-methoxynaphthaldehyde
(λexcitation = 330 nm, λemission = 465 nm, 37 °C) was measured.

Purified recombinant MAGL
enzyme was kindly provided by Dr. Christian Krintel. To measure MAGL
activity, the substrate 4-nitrophenyl acetate ([S]final = 50 μM) was added to wells containing MAGL
in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 8, 0.1 mg/mL BSA) and formation
of the colorimetric 4-nitrophenol (λabs = 412 nm,
37 °C) was measured.

Solubility
For
measuring water solubility, 2–5
mg of each material was added to a 1.7 mL polypropylene tube and was
shaken for 2 days at 37 °C. The resulting water solution was
then filtered through a 0.22 μM PTFE filter and diluted twofold
in MeOH containing 15 nM B-12. The concentration was quantified by
LC/MS/MS.

Activity-Based Protein Profiling for Determining Enzyme Selectivity
Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) was performed by incubating
lysates with an inhibitor, then with the fluorophosphonate probe,
followed by separation by SDS-PAGE and visualization. Inhibitor (in
1 μL of DMSO) was added to a tube containing either brain or
liver tissue homogenate (2 mg/mL, 50 μL) and incubated for 20
min at 30 °C. ActivX TAMRA-FP serine hydrolase probe (1 μL,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) ([TAMRA-FP]final = 2 μM)
was added, and the mixture was incubated another 20 min at 30 °C.
The reaction was quenched with 4× loading buffer, boiled at 90
°C for 5 min, and loaded on a Bolt 4–12% Bis–Tris
SDS-PAGE gel (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The proteins were separated
at 200 V for 35 min run in MOPS SDS buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA). The bands were visualized using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) using a Cy3 filter and analyzed using ImageLab 5.0 (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).

In Vivo FAAH and sEH Target Engagement
Animal experiments
were performed according to established protocols approved by the
University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Male Swiss Webster mice were dosed with the corresponding compound
in DMSO (20 μL, i.p.) and sacrificed 4 h after dosing. Tissues
were homogenized in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH = 7.4, 5 mM EDTA)
with an approximate fivefold dilution by weight. After homogenizing,
the samples were either used as is (sEH assay) or were diluted to
the appropriate linear range for the assay (BCA protein assay and
FAAH assay). sEH assay: to a solution of 100 μL tissue homogenate
was added 1 μL of [3H]JHIII in MeOH ([S]final = 5 μM, approximately 10 000 CPM)
and the reaction was incubated for 20 min. To quench the reaction,
100 μL of MeOH and 250 μL of iso-octane were added and
the mixture was vortexed, centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm, and 50
μL of the aqueous solution was collected, placed in 1 mL of
liquid scintillation fluid, and counted by liquid scintillation. The
values were normalized by the protein concentration in each sample
and compared to vehicle-treated animals such that values represent
% remaining [3H]JHIII hydrolysis activity. FAAH assay:
samples were diluted 1000-fold in phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH = 8.0,
0.1% BSA) for liver and 100-fold for brain. OMP in 2 μL of DMSO
([S]final = 100 μM) was added to
each well, and fluorescence was measured at λexc =
303 nm and λemm = 394 nm for 10 min. The values were
normalized by the protein concentration in each sample and compared
to vehicle-treated animals such that values represent % remaining
OMP hydrolysis activity. Protein assay: the BCA protein assay was
performed as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions,
using BSA as standard.
