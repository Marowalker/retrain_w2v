Through
thermal gravimetric, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy,
and scanning electron microscopic analyses, here we reveal that the
4–5 μm diameter pentagonal shaped rice granules are surprisingly
stable against α-amylase, trypsin, lipase, diluted acids, and
diluted bases. Some papain-sensitive proteins play an important role
in the granular shape stabilization. We employ the reversible thermoresponsive
expansion/shrinking character in aqueous medium of this biopolymeric
pentagonal granular assembly to encapsulate the antibiotic vancomycin
into the granule at the drug loading content of 80% drug mass with
only 20% rice granule mass. The obtained drug-loaded granules display
no-burst but steady sustained release of the water-soluble vancomycin
in an aqueous environment for more than 24 h.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Starch is one of the most
widely and longest experienced edible
materials in human history. It is the main energy supply for humanity
worldwide and is a common form of carbohydrate reserve found in various
rhizomes, cereals, and roots and tubers of diverse plants. Starch
is generated in amyloplasts as discrete granules with various distinguishing
shapes such as oval, round, ogival or elongated to flat, and polyhedral
or lenticular and sizes from submicron to more than 100 μm in
diameter.1 Starch granules contain two
major polysaccharides, amylose and amylopectin. Although amylose is
regarded as a linear polymer chain of α-(1,4)-linked d-glucose residues whereas amylopectin is considered as a chain of
α-(1,4)-linked d-glucose residues with several branches
along the chain through α-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages, amylose
with few branches also exists.2 Usually,
amylose possesses a long linear chain of several hundred to thousand
glucosyl units,3 whereas amylopectin is
extensively branched and possesses a comparatively shorter length
of the main chain.4,5 Most starches in nature contain
amylose and amylopectin with such well-distinguishable structures.
Nevertheless, some starches, from genetically modified or from mutant
plants, contain the so-named intermediate materials.6−8 As the name indicates, structures of these polyglucans are in between
amylopectin and amylose, regarding the branches and the lengths of
the main chains. Normally, amylopectin in starch granules constitutes
the major component by weight, whereas amylose occupies around 15–30%,
but some genetically modified starches contain 50–80% amylose.9−11 Amylopectins usually exist as double helical structures with crystallinity,
which contribute to the semicrystalline structure of the starch granules.12 Crystallite parts in starch granules are arrangements
of double helixes of amylopectin chains into specific patterns such
as monoclinic or hexagonal unit cells.13,14

Proteins
are minor constituents in starch granules; rice granules
contain about 1% by weight of protein. It has been assumed that they
are mostly for storage, biosynthesis, and starch digestion functions.15 Lipids are rare in root and tuber starches but
more abundant in cereal starches, and they are mostly in the forms
of free fatty acids or phospholipids. Rice granules contain approximately
1–2% by weight of lipids.16 Their
functional or structural role is unknown. To the best of our knowledge,
the molecular assembly of biopolymers into the pentagonal granular
structure is still far from complete understanding.

Research
over the utilization of natural materials and renewable
resources has expanded nowadays, ranging from chitosan, cellulose,
dextrin, gums to starch. In terms of applied research, bioplastics,
natural polymer blends,
etc. are remarkable and concreate.17,18 Moreover,
renewable resources forms to catalyst is also achievable.19 Rice granules, another natural material, have
been used mostly in the food industry. The scientific community has
witnessed endless efforts in chemical syntheses and assemblies of
nano- and microsized carriers using various processes and materials
for various applications such as drugs, cosmetics, and paints. Nevertheless,
to date, sustaining the release of water-soluble drugs in aqueous
environments is still a challenge. The biocompatibility of rice granules
witnessed through the history of human beings and their naturally
stable micron-sized granular structure contrive us to hypothesize
the possibility of using this natural granule as a reservoir to sustain
the release of oral drug molecules. We have exercised our curiosity
through the use of the water-soluble antibiotic vancomycin as a model
drug. Vancomycin, a tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal antibiotic
peptide, has been used in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.
Different carrier systems such as chitosan aerogel particles,20 poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
nanoparticles, and N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles21,22 have been experimented for controlling the release of vancomycin,
and most systems still possess low loading and burst release characteristics.
Here, we show the use of the natural rice granule as a carrier to
sustain the release of water-soluble vancomycin. We demonstrate the
exceptionally high stability and extremely high loading capacity of
this natural carrier, together with the surprisingly steady sustained
drug-release character of the obtained vancomycin-loaded rice granules.
This paper also covers molecular interactions among biopolymers that
result in granular structure stabilization and those between vancomycin
and biopolymers in the granules that result in sustained release of
the encapsulated drug molecules. Finally, reaction and degradability
of the granules in tissues were investigated in rats and are reported
here.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Thermoresponsive
Swelling and Shrinking of
Rice Granules
Rice granules (50 mg, ground from Oryza sativa grains, Thai Flour Industry, Bangkok,
Thailand) were dispersed in 20 mL of water, and the mixture was heated
in a closed round-bottomed flask at 80 °C for 30 min. The obtained
granules were immediately (1) subjected to scanning electron microscopic
(SEM, JEOL JSM-6480LV) and confocal microscopic analyses (Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscope, Eclipse, Ti series microscope, Nikon, Japan)
and (2) kept at 4 °C for 24 h and then subjected to both SEM
and microscopic analyses. A similar experiment was carried out but
changing the temperature from 80 to 100 °C.

2.2 Rice Granule Stability
The rice granules
were subjected to incubation with bases, acids, and various enzymes,
e.g., α-amylase, trypsin, lipase, and papain.

2.2.1 Alkaline Treatment
Rice granules
(1 g) were put into 5.0 mL of 0.05 M aqueous NaOH solution, and the
mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. Then, the obtained
granules were subjected to SEM analysis directly.

2.2.2 Acid Treatment
Rice granules (1
g) were put into 5.0 mL of 0.05 M aqueous HCl solution, and the mixture
was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. Then, the obtained granules
were immediately observed by SEM.

2.2.3 α-Amylase
Treatment
α-Amylase
(240 000 units of the α-amylase enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore) was
added into the suspension containing 0.01 M phosphate buffer with
pH 7.4 (5 mL) and rice granules (1 g) and stirred at 37 °C; the
treated granules were sampled at 1 and 3 h and then observed by SEM.
In addition, 50 mg of rice granules was dispersed in 5 mL of 0.01
M phosphate buffer with pH 7.4 and 400 μL of fresh saliva was
added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking
for 1 and 3 h. In addition, 50 mg of rice granules was dispersed in
5 mL of water and 400 μL of fresh saliva was added and the mixture
was incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 1 and 3 h. A similar
experiment with saliva was carried out using 0.01 M phosphate buffer
with pH 7.4 in place of water.

2.2.4 Trypsin
Treatment
Trypsin (5 mg,
65 000 units, from porcine pancreas, Type IX-S, lyophilized
powder, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 mM HCl solution (50 mL),
and then 1 g of vancomycin-loaded rice granules was added and the
mixture was stirred for 6 h. Afterward, samples were subjected to
SEM analysis immediately.

2.2.5 Lipase Treatment
Lipase (5 mg, 2000 units, from porcine pancreas, Type III,
lyophilized cake, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.05 M sodium carbonate
solution (7 mL), and then 50 mg of vancomycin-loaded rice granules
was introduced and gently shaken at 37 °C. Samples were collected
at 6 and 8 h post incubation for immediate SEM analysis.

2.2.6 Papain Treatment
Papain (1000 mg,
10 000 units, from papaya latex, lyophilized powder, Sigma-Aldrich,
Singapore) was put into the suspension of 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline
(50 mL, pH = 7.4) containing vancomycin-loaded rice granules (1.0
g) and stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The treated granules were
then subjected to SEM analysis. Papain (50 mg, 500 units) was added
to the rice granule suspension (50 mg granules in 20 mL water), and
the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. Then, α-amylase
suspension (2 mg, 760 units, in 2 mL water) was added and the mixture
was stirred at 37 °C for 1 h.

2.3 Vancomycin
Encapsulation
Rice granules
(50 mg) were put into an aqueous solution of vancomycin (Vancocin-S,
Siam Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Thailand; 20 mg of vancomycin in 20
mL of water). The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. The granules
were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation, washed with
water, and then kept at 4 °C. We also carried out the similar
experiments with different initial concentrations of vancomycin: 1000;
3000; 5000; 10 000; and 20 000 ppm.

The quantification
of the amount of unencapsulated vancomycin in the supernatant was
carried out by (1) centrifugal filtering (Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL Filters,
with the molecular weight cutoff of 10 000) of the encapsulating
mixture (a mixture of granules and drug solution after heating at
80 °C for 3 h) to separate granules from the supernatant and
(2) quantifying the amount of drug in the obtained supernatant using
UV–visible spectrophotometry (Optizen Pop Series, Korea) with
the aid of a calibration curve constructed from vancomycin standard
solutions prepared in water. The encapsulated vancomycin content,
encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and loading capacity (loading%) were
calculated using below equations    Vancomycin-loaded granules
with 80% loading
content were subjected to papain digestion for 3 h using the same
protocol as that for the rice granules. After digestion, the granules
were then subjected to release experiment as described in Section 2.4.

2.4 Release of Vancomycin from the Granules
The release
was carried out by dispersing 25 mg of the vancomycin-loaded
granules (80% vancomycin loading content) in 10 mL of the release
medium, which was 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (0.137 M of NaCl,
pH 7.4), and placing this suspension into the 12 kDa MW cutoff dialysis
bag (Sigma-Aldrich) and dialyzed against 40 mL of the same release
medium. The setup was done using the jacketed container in which the
temperature of the water jacket was controlled at 37 °C. At each
sampling time point, 2.0 mL of the release medium outside the dialysis
bag was collected with the replacement of the same volume of the fresh
release medium into the system to maintain the volume. The collected
aliquot was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatant
was then subjected to vancomycin quantification by UV–visible
absorption spectroscopic analysis at 282 nm with the aid of a calibration
curve obtained from vancomycin standards freshly prepared in the same
buffer. To make sure that no other entities from the granules would
interfere with the absorption of vancomycin at 282 nm, the blank used
in the UV absorption measurement was prepared in a way similar to
that of the samples, except that drug-free rice granules were used
in place of the vancomycin-loaded granules.

2.5 Thermal
Gravimetric Analyses
Various
granule samples were subjected to thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA,
YRIS Diamond TG-DTA, High Temp 115 PerkinElmer instruments, S II Seiko
instruments, Japan). The analyzed granules included (1) original untreated
rice granules, (2) vancomycin-loaded granules with 80% drug loading
content, (3) vancomycin-loaded granules (with 80% drug loading content)
that had already been incubated in the released medium for 72 h, and
(4) pure vancomycin.

2.6 X-ray Diffraction Analysis
One way
to probe the chemical interactions within the rice granules is to
examine their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Here, rice granules,
heat-treated rice granules (in water at 80 °C for 3 h), vancomycin-loaded
rice granules (vancomycin loading content of 80%), and pure vancomycin
were analyzed by XRD (Rikaku Ultima and 2000 X-ray Diffraction, Japan).

2.7 Tissue
Interaction
To find out whether
the vancomycin-loaded rice granules could be used as drug reservoirs
in the tissue, we tested an inflammatory reaction in mice. The animal
care and use protocol following the National Institutes of Health
(NIH; #85-23, revised 1985) was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University,
Bangkok, Thailand. Male, C57BL/6 mice, 8-week-old, were purchased
from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Nakhornpathom, Thailand.
The subcutaneous injection of rice granules was performed under isoflurane
anesthesia under the sterile condition. In short, the hair above the
loose skin between shoulders was removed and cleaned with 70% alcohol.
Then, 0.375 mg of rice granules at the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL
dispersed in PBS or PBS control (150 μL) (n = 5/group, group I: injected with PBS only; group II: injected with
rice granules in PBS; group III: injected with vancomycin-loaded at
80% loading% rice granules in PBS) was administered subcutaneously.
The inflammatory skin reaction was observed daily. Mice were sacrificed
at 7 days post injection, and the skin lesion was fixed in 10% formalin,
paraffin-embedded, and stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent Hematoxylin
and Eosin stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The inflammatory cells
were observed from the lesion.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Thermoresponsive Size Change
of the Rice Granules
The original rice granules possess an
average size of around 4.5
± 0.7 (average ± SD) μm as estimated from their SEM
images (Figure 1A-1).
After being heated in water for 30 min at either 80 or 100 °C,
the shape of the granules remained the same but the average size increased
to 8.5 ± 0.66 μm as witnessed by both the confocal microscopic
analyses (result not shown) and the SEM images (Figure 1A-2). It should be noted here that 30 min
heating of the granules at 70 °C or lower temperatures in water
did not produce significant size changes and heating in water at 100
°C could not destroy the granular structure (data not shown).
The size of the heated granules, which had been cooled down to 4 °C
for 24 h, was 4.4 ± 0.7 μm (Figure 1A-3). It should be noted that if the heated
granules were left at room temperature of 30 °C their size did
not change back to the original size. These results indicate that
(1) the size of the rice granules can be expanded by heating in water
and can be shrunk back upon cooling at 4 °C and (2) the pentagonal
shape of the granules is preserved during the expansion. It should
be noted here that some of the polymers, probably mostly amylose,
leaked out from the granules during the heat treatment. Usually, the
leak accounted for less than 29 ± 6% of the polymer mass lost
and this agrees well with the previous report.23

The swelling and shrinking ability
of rice granules implies that
these thermoresponsive granules do not possess a rigid membrane structure.
The molecular packing inside the granules is likely to be one of the
major factors determining their morphology. We speculate that partial
hydration/dehydration of biopolymers is responsible for the granule
expansion/shrinking character. We explain the expansion/shrinking
of the material as follows. During the heating process, thermal energy
is used to break the strong polymer–polymer interactions in
the granules so that water–polymer interactions can take place.
Although water–polymer interaction probably gives less negative
enthalpy (ΔH) than that from the strong polymer–polymer
binding, the increase in entropy upon polymer swelling at a higher
temperature (larger TΔS term)
helps propel the swelling process forward as the more negative Gibbs
free energy will be released. Therefore, the granules expand at high
temperature together with water absorption into their interior. Upon
cooling down, the entropy term becomes less prominent at lower temperatures;
thus, the system adapts itself to achieve a more negative Gibbs free
energy by allowing the polymer–polymer interactions to take
place so that larger heat release (compared to that resulted from
polymer–water interaction) can be obtained. This makes the
shrinking process spontaneous at lower temperatures. It should be
noted here that water draining out from the particles was clearly
observed when the centrifuged heated granules were kept at 4 °C.

Rice thus happens to be a commonly
known thermoresponsive material. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned
here that the reports and study on a stimuli-responsive material that
is 100% natural are rare. In contrast, there are many reported synthetic
materials that are specifically designed and assembled to be stimuli
responsive, e.g., the light-responsive triblock copolymers,24 the optically active and thermoresponsive star
block copolymers,25 the redox-responsive
micelles,26 etc.

3.2 Stability
of Rice Granules
The rice
granules are surprisingly stable against various physical and chemical
treatment processes. Normal grinding of the dry granules could not
change their size and shape (data not shown). Neither 6 h soaking
in 0.05 M sodium hydroxide solution nor in 0.05 M hydrochloric acid
could destroy the granules (Figure 1A-4,B-1). The results indicate that granules well tolerate
acids and bases to a certain level. Interestingly, although amylose
and amylopectin are the main constituents of rice granules, incubating
the granules with α-amylase, an enzyme that can digest amylose
and amylopectin, did not produce granule disintegration; the granular
structure of the material was well preserved. Only some changes on
the surface smoothness could be observed (Figure 1B-2). The surface-eluted granules observed
from α-amylase digestion help confirm our above hypothesis that
the preservation of the granular structure does not involve any membrane
structure. This surprising result also implies a limited amount of
accessible amylose and amylopectin at the surface of the granules
that can be digested by α-amylase. Incubation of rice granules
with fresh saliva also did not produce any disintegration of the granules
(data not shown).

Trypsin treatment was carried out to investigate
whether the enzymes
in the human stomach act over the rice granules. No change on granules
was observed after trypsin treatment (Figure 1B-3). Combined trypsin and α-amylase
treatments, either trypsin first or α-amylase first, also produced
no significant change to the granules (SEM data not shown). Last,
lipase-treated granules also showed no significant change from the
original polyhedral granules with 4.5 ± 0.68 μm diameter
(Figure 1B-4). This
implies that a lipid is not likely to be involved in granular shape
stabilization. Using these enzymes on heat-treated granules also gave
similar results.

Remarkably, papain, a protease with endopeptidase,
aminopeptidase,
and dipeptidyl peptidase activities, could effectively destroy the
rice granule structure. The papain-treated granules mostly lost granular
shape, and disintegration of the granules clearly took place (Figure 1C-1). Adversely,
when α-amylase treatment was carried out on the papain-treated
granules, complete destruction of the granules could be observed (Figure 1C-2).

Above
observations lead us to hypothesize that the granules contain
amylose and amylopectin packed with some specific proteins; without
destroying the papain-sensitive proteins first, amylose and amylopectin
could not be digested by α-amylase. These papain-sensitive proteins
probably comprise an insignificant amount of arginine and lysine amino
acid residues since they cannot be destroyed by trypsin. As mentioned
above, partial hydration
is responsible for the granule swelling. Since papain-sensitive proteins
are the components responsible for the granular shape stabilization,
it is also possible that these protein components might be the unswellable
components of the granules.

The above results contradict the
long-time assumption of the complete
digestion of rice granules in the mouth and the stomach where α-amylase
and trypsin exist, respectively. However, the experimental results
here match the fact that eating enough rice usually produces long-lasting
energy and good bulk for the colon. It is very likely that rice granules
are not fully digested and absorbed through mouth/stomach/small intestines
but are also being digested by some microorganisms in the colon. Their
resistance to complete digestion may contribute to the necessary bulk
required for a healthy environment for microorganisms in the colon.21 The ability of papain to disintegrate rice granules
is noteworthy. Traditional Thai northeastern cuisine of raw papaya
(sauce of papain) with rice has been known to supply people with high
energy for labor load. Eating rice with papain likely helps to release
more carbohydrates from the granules.

3.3 Drug
Encapsulation
Here, the drug
encapsulation was carried out by incubating the thermoresponsive rice
granules in vancomycin solution at 80 °C. We obtained the amounts
of drug molecules taken up into the granules by quantifying the amount
of drug left in the solution after separating out the granules by
filtration centrifugation. We also performed a washing of the drug-loaded
granules with water and took into account the amount of drug in the
washed solutions as the unloaded drug. The result clearly indicates
that vancomycin could be effectively loaded into the granules at various
drug loading contents depending on the concentration of vancomycin
solution used during the loading process. The vancomycin-loaded granules
(Figure 1C-3) possess
morphology similar to those of the heat-treated granules but with
the size of 5.7 ± 0.95 μm (after being placed at 4 °C).

We hypothesize
that during the swelling of the granules in hot vancomycin solution
the drug together with water got into the interior of the granules
and was trapped in the granules (Figure 2). The increase in encapsulation efficiency
(EE) along with the increase in initial drug concentration agrees
well with our proposed encapsulation mechanism that drug molecules
occupy the interior of the granules during the heat-induced granule
swelling as the solution penetrates the granules. The higher drug
concentration means the larger numbers of molecules at a certain volume
of solution. Swelling capacity limits the volume of aqueous solution
getting into the granules. Therefore, granules that are swollen in
solution with high drug concentrations should have higher numbers
of drug molecules getting into their interior, compared to those that
are swelled in solution with lower drug concentrations. After getting
in, vancomycin molecules likely bind to polymer chains in the granules,
probably through multiple hydrogen bonding (Figure 3), and are retained in the granules even
after the granules are cooled and water molecules migrate out from
the granules.

Figure 2 Efficiencies of the encapsulation process and loading
contents
of the obtained vancomycin-loaded granules at various initial drug
concentrations.

Figure 3 Model of vancomycin loading
inside a rice granule. Hydrogen-bond
interactions among amylose and amylopectin chains are disrupted in
the presence of vancomycin molecules, which can effectively form hydrogen
bonding with the amylose and amylopectin chains.

3.4 Release of Vancomycin from Granules
Vancomycin-loaded granules with 80% vancomycin loading content showed
no-burst release of the drug. Steady sustained release of 60% of the
loaded drug during the 24 h incubation in aqueous release medium was
observed. The release of approximately 10% of the loaded drug then
followed on the next day. Explicitly, the release then stopped afterward
(Figure 4). The experiments
were repeated many times along with the replacement of the release
medium, which made sure that the stop was not caused by the high concentration
of the drug in the release medium. The same results were still obtained.
The result indicated that approximately 30% of the loaded vancomycin
possess strong interaction with components of the granules and could
not be released. Adding papain to the system did not produce more
release of vancomycin from the granules (data not shown). This result
rules out the physical barrier as the drug-sustaining factor but confirms
that the molecular interaction of vancomycin with biopolymers, likely
amylose/amylopectin, is responsible for the drug retention. Heating
the granules did not help in releasing 30% drug left in the granules.
Therefore, we concluded that strong interaction between vancomycin
and biopolymers probably accounted for the 30% unreleased vancomycin.
It should be noted here that, to make sure that the 30% unreleasable
vancomycin was not misinterpreted from drug degradation, we also encapsulated
the bright purple anthocyanin into the granules (data not shown).
The release experiment of anthocyanin-loaded rice granules gave a
similar result to that of the vancomycin-loaded granules; however,
this time, the left-over anthocyanin in the granules could be confirmed
easily as the granule were purple.

Figure 4 Accumulative release of vancomycin from
vancomycin-loaded granules
with 80% vancomycin loading content. The release was carried out by
dispersing 25 mg of the vancomycin-loaded granules (80% vancomycin
loading content) in 10 mL of 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (0.137
M NaCl, pH 7.4).

3.5 TGA Analysis
The thermogram of the
original rice granules displays a relatively sharp endothermic peak
at around 295–315 °C with a maximum at 305 °C (Figure 5), agreeing well
with their semicrystalline structure. Heat-treated granules and alkaline-treated
granules showed similar thermograms to those of the original granules.
Acid-treated granules also showed a thermogram similar to that of
the original granules (data not shown). These data indicate that heating
in water (100 °C or less) and alkaline/acid treatment could not
disrupt interactions among biopolymer chains within the granules.
In contrast, papain-treated granules showed a much broader endothermic
peak with the peak maximum at around 260–330 °C with the
maximum at 285 °C. The information agreed with the SEM images
(Figure 1), which explicitly
showed that papain could effectively destroy the granular assembly
of the biopolymers.

Figure 5 Thermal gravimetric analysis of granules with 80% vancomycin
loading
content; vancomycin-loaded granules after incubation in release medium
for 72 h (70% of the loaded vancomycin released out and thus left
with granules containing 55% vancomycin loading content); original
granules; pure vancomycin; heat-treated granules; and alkaline-treated
granules.

The thermogram of pure vancomycin
shows a broad endothermic peak
at around 210–290 °C with the maximum at 237 °C,
which corresponds to the noncrystalline structure of vancomycin (Figure 5). Compared to unloaded
granules, vancomycin-loaded granules with 80% drug loading content
possess a much broader endothermic peak at 250–320 °C.
The disappearance of the peak maxima of both the original granules
at 305 °C and the vancomycin at 237 °C together with the
new peak maxima at 265 and 302 °C clearly illustrates molecular
interactions between vancomycin molecules and the polymer constituents
inside the rice granules and disruption of the original molecular
interactions among polymer chains in the original granules and interactions
among vancomycin molecules. The result implies that the vancomycin
molecules and biopolymers in the granules are in the state of solid
solution with well-dispersed vancomycin molecules in the granules.
Unfortunately, the interaction between vancomycin and polymer constituents
in the granules could not be witnessed from the IR spectrum of the
vancomycin-loaded granules (Figure 6). Nevertheless, the IR spectrum of the drug-loaded
granule confirms the high drug loading content of drug molecules in
the granules as the spectrum of the drug-loaded granules resembles
the spectrum of vancomycin.

vancomycin-loaded
rice granules (with 80% drug loading content).

After incubating the vancomycin-loaded granules (80% drug
loading
content) in the release medium for 72 h and approximately 70% of the
loaded drug released from the granules, the thermogram of the granules
still showed roughly the broad peak at 260–300 °C, not
much different in peak shape from that of the vancomycin-loaded granules
(before the release), only lower in intensity. This also confirms
the presence of unreleasable vancomycin in the granules.

3.6 XRD Analysis
To further understand
the molecular packing inside the granules, XRD analysis was carried
out. The noncrystallinity detected by the XRD pattern of vancomycin
(Figure 7) correlates
well with its broad TGA peak (Figure 5) shown earlier. Original rice granules with characters
of semicrystallinity show three semisharp peaks at 2θ of 17,
18, and 23°. The XRD pattern of the heat-treated granules was
similar to that of the original granules, except for that the peaks
were somewhat less sharp, which means that the crystallinity of the
granules was slightly destroyed by heating in water. Vancomycin-loaded
rice granules were significantly less crystalline than the unloaded
granules, and the XRD pattern of the material showed a broad peak
at 2θ of 20°. The disappearance of granule’s crystallinity
upon drug encapsulation illustrates the change in the molecular packing
within the granules; vancomycin interference into the original ordered
packing of the polymers plays the role. Both the XRD and TGA results
prove that, inside the granules, the direct interaction between vancomycin
molecules and biopolymeric
chains disrupts the molecular packing and crystallinity of the granules.
We also investigated the XRD pattern of the drug-loaded granules after
drug release. As mentioned above (Section 3.4), complete release can never be achieved;
the granules possess approximately 30% drug loading after the release.
The XRD information agrees well with the TGA result. This confirms
that the remaining vancomycin molecules bind to the biopolymers.
The original packing of the granules was not restored with partial
drug release.

rice
granules, vancomycin-loaded granules with 80% loading content, vancomycin-loaded
granules after the release experiment (left with 30% drug loading
content), and vancomycin.

3.7 Tissue Interaction
In addition to
showing above that rice granules are indigestible by amylase in the
mouth, trypsin in the stomach, and lipase in the small intestine,
here we have also observed that the granules are nonallergic to the
tissue and also undigestible by any enzyme of the skin reaction. Both
the granule injection and the
PBS injection showed no inflammatory reaction. In the histology at
7 day post injection, the granules were still intact with no significant
inflammatory reaction (data not shown). In addition, there were no
eosinophils and basophils in the lesion, implying the nonallergenic
reaction of the granules in the mice.

4 Conclusions
Through SEM, confocal microscopic, TGA, and XRD analyses, here
we have shown that the assembly of biopolymers into the pentagonal
granular structure of the natural rice granules is surprisingly stable
against aqueous heat treatment (at temperatures of less than 10 °C),
diluted strong acids, diluted strong bases, and digestion by enzymes
found in the gut system (α-amylase, trypsin, and lipase). The
granule, however, can be effectively disintegrated by papain. The
granules possess no allergic or inflammatory reaction to tissues of
mice, but they are also indigestible and nonresorbable in the tissue.
The granules show reversible thermoresponsive
size changes in water with expansion at high temperature and size
reduction when cooled. We have used this thermoresponsive size change
character to encapsulate the water-soluble vancomycin into the granules
and have easily obtained the vancomycin-loaded granules with the surprisingly
high drug loading content of 80% (80% drug mass, 20% biopolymer mass
of the granules). Through the TGA and XRD analyses, we have shown
that vancomycin molecules interact with biopolymers. As expected from
drug–biopolymer interactions, the vancomycin-loaded granules
indeed show steady sustained release of vancomycin in an aqueous environment,
with 60% of the loaded drug being steadily released out in 1 day with
no-burst release and another 10% of the loaded drug being released
the next day. The remaining 30% vancomycin could not be released from
the granules. Other water-soluble compounds such as anthocyanin can
also be encapsulated into rice granules, and the anthocyanin-loaded
granules show similar sustained release characters with some unreleased
anthocyanin remaining in the granules. Digestion with papain could
not help releasing the nonreleasable vancomycin from the biopolymers.
The stability of the rice granules against acids and digestive enzymes,
their ability to encapsulate water-soluble drug molecules at high
loading, and their sustained drug-release characters lead to not only
a better understanding of this natural granular material but also
the convincing application of rice granules in the oral drug delivery,
especially for the colon-targeting drugs.
