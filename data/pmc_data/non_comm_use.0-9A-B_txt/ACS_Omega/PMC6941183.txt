Bisphenol A polycarbonate (BPA-PC) is a remarkable high-performance
engineering polymer, although it is susceptible to photo-Fries and
hydrolytic degradation. New poly(aryl ether carbonates) were synthesized
to address these limitations by replacing the chain backbone carbonate
ester functionality with aryl ether functionality. The monomers for
these new polymers were synthesized by a variation of the Ullmann
condensation accelerated by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione and
promoted by Cs2CO3 and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
under mild conditions. Four such bisphenol A-based diarylether monomers
containing different mass ratios of carbonate ester groups were prepared
and polymerized with phosgene gas to give novel poly(aryl ether carbonates).
Polymers were named as di-o-BPA-PC 9′, tri-o-BPA-PC 11′, tetra-o-BPA-PC 13′, and penta-o-BPA-PC 15′ where di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-
reflect the number of diphenylisopropylidene units in each of the
respective polymers. The molecular weights of the resulting four poly(aryl
ether carbonates) were measured by gel permeation chromatography.
Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure glass transition
temperature (Tg). The polymers exhibited
weight-average molecular weights up to 4.09 × 105 g/mol
and Tg in the range of 136 to 149 °C
with no melting temperature peak, indicative of their amorphous character.
The new polymers formed transparent and flexible films by solution
casting from chloroform solution.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Bisphenol A polycarbonate
(BPA-PC, Figure 1)
is a widely used engineering thermoplastic
with remarkable properties including ductility, toughness, and optical
clarity. As a strong, high-performance amorphous engineering thermoplastic,
it is well-known in the modern chemical industry for its temperature
resistance, optical properties, and impact strength.1

Figure 1 Molecular structure of BPA-PC.

BPA-PC is not without its problems, however. Its
BPA monomer is
associated with early sexual maturation, altered behavior, and effects
on prostate and mammary glands as demonstrated in rodent studies.
In humans, BPA has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
and male sexual dysfunction in exposed workers. As a known endocrine
disruptor, BPA is included in the EU list of potential endocrine disrupting
substances. Although controversy continues over the toxicology of
BPA, BPA-PC itself has been banned by the FDA in 2012 in products
such as sippy cups and baby bottles which are intended for use by
children under 12 years of age, owing to documented hydrolysis and
migration of BPA.2−11

The polar carbonate ester groups in the backbone chains of
BPA-PC
subject the polymer to moisture uptake and have been demonstrated
to be the reason for hydrolysis of the polymer,12−17 the kinetics of which are second-order.15 This mechanism is responsible in part for chemical aging of the
material which leads to degradation of the physical properties of
BPA-PC and which ultimately leads to the release of BPA. The labile
carbonate ester functionality in BPA-PC thus has implications for
the mechanical strength and ductility of the material, in addition
to potential environmental and toxicological concerns.18,19

In addition to hydrolysis, BPA-PC also undergoes photodegradation
in sunlight.18,20,21 Photodegradation is known to occur via the photo-Fries rearrangement
with concomitant photooxidation and has been studied extensively for
several decades.1,20 Photoexcitation of the carbonate
ester groups is responsible for this reaction which converts the carbonate
esters into various hydroxyketones. As per the First Law of Photochemistry
(the Grotthuss–Draper law): “Only light which is absorbed
by a molecule is effective in producing a reaction which changes the
molecule.”22 The loci responsible
for the photo-Fries reaction in BPA-PC are the same as those responsible
for chain scission by hydrolysis, viz., the labile carbonate ester
linkages in the backbone of the BPA-PC polymer chain. The net effect
of both hydrolysis and the photo-Fries reaction is to decrease efficient
chain entanglements necessary for the otherwise superior mechanical
properties of the bulk material.23−26

Unlike carbonate ester
linkages, diarylether linkages are exceptionally
difficult to hydrolyze, requiring strong acids or bases,27 conditions which commercial BPA-PC is not subject
to in its range of practical applications. This difficulty of hydrolysis
is due to the stability of the aryl C–O bond.29,30,32−35 Barnett notes: “Phenolic
ethers are stable, inert substances.”28,31 Ghashwall notes that aryl ether “hydrolysis requires concentrated
hydrochloric or hydroiodic acid in a sealed tube.”36 More recent cleavage methods involve a catalytic
reaction for aryl ether cleavage,37,38 but, again,
such conditions are laboratory conditions outside those in which commercial
BPA-PC finds application.

Diarylethers are additionally unable
to undergo the photo-Fries
reaction, although photoexcitation of diphenyl ether has been shown
to occur under irradiation, albeit only in the presence of a solvent.39 Substitution of diarylether functionality for
carbonate ester functionality would therefore be anticipated to mitigate
the photochemical and hydrolytic disadvantages of bulk BPA-PC and
could additionally be expected to enhance the chain flexibility40−43 of the polymer, owing to replacement of the trigonal planar carbonate
ester groups in BPA-PC which are responsible for restricted rotation
of the polymer chains. Replacement of these latter groups by aryl
ether groups which are tetrahedral about oxygen would therefore also
be anticipated to lead to potential processing advantages: it is well-appreciated
by industry that the molecular weight of BPA-PC itself must be kept
deliberately low because high molecular weight material leads to increased
viscosity which in turn hinders polymer flow during processing, particularly
during melt molding.44

Although our
synthetic strategy to tailored poly(aryl ether carbonates)
having precisely spaced carbonate ester groups in their backbones
is novel, the late Allan S. Hay (1929–2017) of the General
Electric Research Laboratory in Niskayuna, New York was the first
to envisage an all poly(aryl ether) polymer based on diphenylisopropylidene
containing no carbonate ester groups whatsoever, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Poly(aryl ether) polymer
molecular structure containing repeat
diphenylisopropylidene units.

Inspired by Mark’s work that bisphenols
in the presence
of a large excess of another phenol and methanesulfonic acid as catalyst
underwent a transalkylation reaction producing a new bisphenol,45 Hay varied the conditions for spirobiindane
bisphenol formation, substituting diphenyl ether for phenol in an
attempt to produce the polymer shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Hay’s envisaged polymer produced by transalkyation
of BPA
with diphenyl ether.

First published in 1990, Hay’s proposed
reaction for the
synthesis of the polymer in Figure 3 was only moderately successful: an acid-catalyzed
mixture of acetone, phenol, 3,5-dimethylphenol, and diphenylether
gave the trimer of the polymer shown in Figure 3 and in 10% yield only.45,46 Nonetheless, a patent quickly followed in 1993 for polymeric species
production.47 Although Hay claimed the
polymer of Figure 3 which had a degree of polymerization anywhere from 20 to 100, the
polymers in the embodiments of the patent had relatively low glass
transition temperatures, ranging from 70 °C seen in his example
9 to a maximum of 93 °C seen in example 10. The highest degree
of polymerization attained was cited to be 34 in example 10, which
correlated with a molecular weight of approximately 7149.52, and no
embodiments in the patent admit to a high molecular weight polymer.
Hay, in fact, makes specific reference to oligomeric species: “The
oligomers of the invention can be used in polymerization reactions
with various monomers and reagents to produce a wide variety of polymers
including polyethers, polysulfides, polyesters, polycarbonates, and
polyformals. Employing oligomers of the invention, polymers suitable
as engineering or industrial plastics, having high Tg in the range 100–200 °C may be produced.”
No follow up work on this patent was reported in the literature.

Thus, the envisaged polymer in Figure 2 has never been synthesized as a high molecular
weight polymer. Our current work represents the development of a synthetic
protocol by which carbonate ester groups are successively able to
be replaced by diarylether linkages, converging on the structure of
the polymer in Figure 2, yet containing some carbonate ester linkages in the polymer backbone,
unlike Hay’s projected polymer.

The objective of this
work is to synthesize a series of new bisphenol
monomers which incorporate diphenylisopropylidene units characteristic
of BPA, yet in which the diphenylisopropylidene units—unlike
in BPA-PC—are connected by diarylether linkages, as shown in Figure 2. These resultant
monomers will then be polymerized using phosgene gas to link the bisphenol
units by carbonate ester functionality. Although not identical to
Hay’s work, the monomeric unit in this work are aryl ethers
of diphenylisopropylidene units seen in Hay’s oligomer. In
the current work, the smaller molecular weight monomers would result
in poly(aryl ether carbonates) having a greater number of carbonate
ester linkages per average polymer chain compared with the larger
molecular weight monomers, which would instead result in fewer carbonate
ester linkages per average polymer chain. The Tgs of these materials will be compared to those of both Hay’s
oligomeric polyether and to that of BPA-PC.

2 Results and Discussion
In the current
work, many variants of the classic Ullmann48−51 reaction were attempted for the
synthesis of new diarylether monomers,
but only one method was successful. Failed methods included utilization
of copper(II)-promoted coupling of arylboronic acids and phenols,52 room-temperature copper(II) acetate-mediated
coupling of substituted phenols with arylboronic acid from BPA and
pyridine,53 ligandless Raney Ni–Al
alloy/copper cross-coupling reaction from aryl iodide with BPA phenols,54 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane as a tripod
ligand for copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of aryl iodide
from BPA and phenols from BPA,55 and a
palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction.56 Buck’s modified Ullmann copper-catalyzed coupling
reaction using copper(I) chloride and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione
(TMHD) as the ligand57 was the only successful
method found in the current work for the synthesis of the new diarylether,
diphenylisopropylidene-containing monomers.

Using the above
method, four new bisphenolic monomers (9, 11, 13,
and 15) have been successfully synthesized utilizing a known starting
material, the monoamino analogue, 2, of BPA. Diazotiation of the amino
functionality of this latter compound with subsequent iodine replacement
proceeded smoothly to afford 4, the phenolic hydroxyl, which was then
protected by benzylation to afford 7. This latter compound was elaborated
using the method of Buck57 into the new
bisphenolic monomers, 9, 11, 13, and 15. These four new monomers contain
2, 3, 4, and 5 diphenylisopropylidene units, respectively, which are
linked by diarylether functionality. Although the synthetic strategy
employed could be further extended to synthesize additional monomers
with even greater numbers of diphenylisopropylidene units, this was
not done.

Polymerization of the four new bisphenols using phosgene
gas gave
the new poly(aryl ether carbonates), 9′, 11′, 13′,
and 15′, which were characterized using gel permeation chromatography
(GPC), 1H NMR, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Although the degree of polymerization of the polymers was lower with
increasing molecular weights of the respective monomers (88, 47, 30,
and 25 for 9′, 11′, 13′, and 15′, respectively)
as seen in Table 2,
the average molecular weights of the polymers were comparable with
that of commercial BPA-PC, with the exception of 9′ which had
a molecular weight 1.5× higher than that of commercial BPA-PC.

As seen in Table 2, there are numerically 88, 47, 30, and 25 carbonate ester groups
per average polymer chain in polymers 9′, 11′, 13′,
and 15′, respectively. With regard to the current objective
of reducing the average numbers of carbonate ester groups per polymer
chain compared to the number found in commercial BPA-PC (which has
105 carbonate ester groups per chain), polymers 9′, 11′,
13′, and 15′ therefore display a 16, 55, 71, and 76%
reduction, respectively, in the number of their carbonate ester groups
compared to commercial BPA-PC.

The low Tgs noted by Hay in his patent
were likely due to low molecular weights obtained in the polymerization
process. There is no reason that the polymer in Figure 3 should cease to undergo electrophilic aromatic
substitution with acetone as long as acetone was in constant supply,
which was the case under Hay’s conditions. This suggests that
chain growth may have been arrested as a result of premature end-capping
of oligomeric species, possibly by the formation of spirobiindane
moieties, the latter a well-known product of acid-catalyzed BPA decomposition
and recombination as previously mentioned above.58−66 In his 1993 article, Hay, in fact, makes specific reference to the
limitations inherent in his polymerization method, which results in
premature termination of polymerization preventing the obtention of
high molecular weight material.47 If spirobiindane
end-capping occurred, the large free volume induced by any spirobiindane
endcapping would be reasonably expected to additionally lower the Tg of the final materials.

2.1 Synthesis of Diarylether Diphenylisopropylidene-Containing
Monomers Having Different Diphenylisopropylidene–Ether Ratios
The synthesis of the desired diphenylisopropylidene monomers was
achieved in multiple steps from commercially available 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol.
Important starting materials were necessary to begin the synthesis
of the new diarylether diphenylisopropylidene-containing monomers.

Mono-iodination of arenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt of 2,2′-(4-hydroxy-4′-aminodiphenyl)propane, 3, with NaI/I2 in acetonitrile gave I-BPA–OH, 4, in good yield (90%). 2,2′-(4-Benzyloxy-4′-iododiphenyl)propane, 7, reacted with compound 4, in the presence of
benzyl chloride in ethyl acetate and gave compound 7 in
good yield (90%). The synthesis of compound 7 is shown
in Scheme 1.

Monomer 9 was successfully prepared by hydrogen deprotection
of compound 8, which was prepared by reacting compound 6 with compound 7 in the presence of Cs2CO3, CuCl, and the TMHD ligand in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP).

Monomer 9 was prepared from commercially
available
bisphenol A. The method of Buck57 was used
to effect the condensation reaction of 1.00 equiv compound 6 with 1.10 equiv compound 7. Anhydrous Cs2CO3 (1.50 equiv) as base and CuCl (0.500 equiv) as the
catalyst were added to the anhydrous NMP system. The reaction proceeded
smoothly under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere for 72 h to afford
the desired Ullmann condensation product 8 at 56% yield. The dihydroxy
condensation product 9 in Scheme 2—route 1 was obtained by dissolving compound
8 in 10 mL of ethyl acetate, 10 mol % of the Pd catalyst was added,
and the mixture was degassed twice under vacuum (using a water pump),
replacing each time the vacuum by hydrogen. The reaction mixture was
left at room temperature for 4 h connected to a double-layer balloon
of hydrogen. The catalyst was filtered off and washed with ethyl acetate.
The filtrate was concentrated to give compound 9. Flash
chromatography was used for purification. Yield: 98%. This compound
has previously been reported, but only as a product of γ-irradiated
BPA-PC.67

2.2 General Procedure for Polymerization
After successful preparation of the di-o-BPA dihydroxy
monomer, 9, polymerization was performed by solution
polymerization using phosgene gas as described above and in a previous
work.68

Tri-o-BPA
monomer 11 was successfully prepared by dehydrogenation
of compound 10, the latter of which was prepared by reacting
compound 1 with compound 7 in the presence
of Cs2CO3, CuCl, and the TMHD ligand in NMP.
Buck’s methodology57 was used to
effect the condensation reaction of 2.00 equiv compound 7 with 1.0 equiv compound 1. Anhydrous Cs2CO3 (2.5 equiv) as the base and CuCl as the catalyst were
added to the anhydrous NMP system. The reaction proceeded smoothly
under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere for 72 h to afford the desired
Ullmann condensation product 10 in 72% yield. This material
was purified by flash chromatography. The dihydroxy condensation product, 11, in Scheme 2–route 2, was obtained in good yield (63%) in 7 h using the
H2/Pd balloon method at room temperature in the ethyl acetate
solvent (10.0 mL). Monomer 13 was prepared successfully
as shown in Scheme 2—route 3. This polymer has three diarylether linkages and
four diphenylisopropylidene units.

Tetra-o-BPA
monomer 13 was successfully
prepared by hydrogen deprotection of compound 12, which
was prepared by reacting compound 7 with monomer 9 in the presence of Cs2CO3, CuCl, and
the TMHD ligand in NMP. Again, Buck’s methodology57 was used to effect the condensation reaction
of 2.00 equiv compound 7 with 1.0 equiv monomer 9. Anhydrous Cs2CO3 (2.5 equiv) as the
base and CuCl as the catalyst were added to the anhydrous NMP system.
The reaction proceeded smoothly under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere
for 72 h to afford the desired Ullmann condensation product 12 in 77% yield. The dihydroxy condensation product, 13, in Scheme 2—route 3 was obtained in good yield in 3 h under H2/Pd at room temperature using ethyl acetate as the solvent (10.0
mL). Yield: 71%. Monomer 15 was prepared successfully
as shown in Scheme 2—route 4. This polymer has four diarylether linkages and five
diphenylisopropylidene units.

The penta-o-BPA
monomer, 15 was successfully
prepared by hydrogen deprotection of compound 14, which
was prepared by reacting compound 7 with monomer 11 in the presence of Cs2CO3, CuCl,
and the TMHD ligand in NMP. The method of Buck57 was used to effect the condensation reaction of 2.00 equiv
compound 7 with 1.0 equiv monomer 11. Anhydrous
Cs2CO3 (2.5 equiv) as the base and CuCl as the
catalyst were added to the anhydrous NMP system. The reaction proceeded
smoothly under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere for 72 h to afford
the desired Ullmann condensation product 14 in 81% yield.
The dihydroxy condensation product, 15, in Scheme 2—route 4, was obtained
in good yield in 3 h using the H2/Pd method at room temperature
using ethyl acetate as the solvent (10.0 mL). Yield: 75%.

All
poly(aryl ether carbonates) produced are labeled as di-o-BPA-PC 9′, tri-o-BPA-PC 11′, tetra-o-BPA-PC 13′, and penta-o-BPA-PC 15′. All
monomers and their corresponding polymers are summarized in Table 1.

in methylene chloride and reprecipitated in methanol. This was repeated
twice before molecular weight measurements were made.

As polymerizations of each new monomer in this article
were run
under identical conditions, no attempt was made to optimize molecular
weights. Thus, detailed comparisons dependent on factors including
molecular weights and degree of polymerization, all of which varied
from polymer to polymer, are not possible. Nonetheless, several general
trends may be observed from Table 2. First, other than Hay’s reported polymer 10,
the molecular weights of all four new polymers were comparable with
or above that of commercial BPA-PC, even though the degree of polymerization
varied. Second, the size of the monomer was clearly influential on
the degree of polymerization for the resulting polymers: the series
of polymers decreased in their degree of polymerization as the size
of the monomer increased. Third, the four new polymers had Tgs and molecular weights significantly higher
than the polymer 10 documented in Hay’s work.48 Polymer 9′, in fact, had a Tg nearly that of BPA-PC itself.

It appears
that, despite 9′ having fewer carbonate
ester groups per average chain than BPA-PC to stiffen it, the higher
molecular weight of 9′ compared with BPA-PC (1.5×
greater) may alone have been influential in raising the Tg. Polymers 13′ and 15′ had nearly equivalent Tgs as well as
nearly equivalent molecular weights. Whether a lower degree of polymerization
was influential in a lower Tg among the
four polymers is difficult to assess: it is well appreciated by the
literature that a lower degree of polymerization leads to a lower
entanglement density as well as a greater number of chain ends in
the bulk, imparting greater free volume and thereby lowering Tg.69 Restricted rotational
degrees of freedom particularly around the carbonate ester functionality
in BPA-PC’s backbone chain create a more rigid structure,1 and this may partly account for the increasingly
higher Tg with the increasing number of
carbonate ester groups per average polymer chain in the respective
polymers. Finally, in spite of their differences, the Tgs of polymers 13′ and 15′ appear to be converging on a Tg that
could be close to that of the ideal poly(aryl ether) polymer of Figure 2 which is yet to
be synthesized. This Tg (136 °C)
is 43 °C higher than that of Hay’s highest Tg polymer (93 °C), indeed suggesting the oligomeric
nature of the polymers obtained by Hay, if not large spirobiindane
end-caps on his materials.

3 Conclusions
Synthetic routes for four
new bisphenol monomers were successfully
designed, followed by successful synthesis of the monomers. The monomers
were polymerized to their corresponding poly(aryl ether carbonates),
reestablishing historical continuity with the objective of Hay’s
work some 25 years ago, namely, addressing the issue of BPA-PC chain
scission. The synthesis of the monomers for these polymers relied
on an iterative method to elaborate monomers using the same starting
materials and synthetic processes for each, a method which in principle
could conceivably be extended to even further reduce the number of
carbonate ester groups in the final polymers.

The synthesis
of the four new monomers relied on Buck’s57 modified Ullmann condensation reaction using
TMHD as the reaction-rate accelerating material, cesium carbonate
as the base, and CuCl as the catalyst. This was found to be the only
method among many tried which was able to successfully effect the
aryl coupling reaction for the desired monomers.

Solution polymerization
of the four new bisphenols using phosgene
gas in methylene chloride solvent resulted in four new poly(aryl ether
carbonates). These polymers were characterized by 1H NMR
spectroscopy, GPC, and DSC. They exhibited weight-average molecular
weights up to 4.09 × 105 g/mol and Tgs in the range from 136 to 149 °C with no melting
temperature peak, indicative of their amorphous character. As the Tg of commercial BPA-PC is 150 °C, this
was surprising in that diarylethers are known to be more flexible
about the C–O bond than their counterparts, the carbonate esters
which tend to rigidify the polymer chain owing to resonance effects
into the carbonate ester group. The new polymers formed transparent
and flexible films by solution casting from chloroform solution.

Although the polymer of Figure 2 is yet to be synthesized, the new synthesized polymers
converge on the structure of Hayes’ ideal of a no-carbonate
ester-containing polymer. In one case, the Tg approaches that of BPA-PC, giving an indication of the maximum Tg Hay’s no-carbonate ester-containing
polymer could conceivably approach, had it been of higher molecular
weight.

Experimental work on the stability properties of these
new polymers
relative to BPA-PC is yet to be undertaken. However, as these four
new polymers have greatly reduced numbers of carbonate ester groups,
the polymers would therefore be anticipated to have a reduced number
of chain scission “events” such as hydrolysis and the
photo-Fries reaction relative to BPA-PC itself. Furthermore, as these
new polymers contain no BPA monomer when hydrolyzed, they would not
lead to environmental and toxicological effects characteristic of
BPA in BPA-PC.

Additional work to optimize the polymerization
conditions is in
progress which will better allow us to understand the effect of the
degree of polymerization on the melt viscosity and glass transition
properties, particularly as compared with that of commercial BPA-PC,
as well as on the environmental stability of these new materials.

4 Experimental Section
Starting materials
and reagents necessary to synthesize the corresponding
monomers follow.

4.1 Materials
All reagents were used
without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. Bisphenol
A (99+%), boron trifluoride etherate, methyl iodide, anhydrous tetrahydrofuran
(THF), tert-butyl nitrite, sodium chloride, copper(I)
chloride, potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 99+%),
benzyl chloride, TMHD, sodium iodide, cesium carbonate, and anhydrous
NMP 99% were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as
received. Hexane, anhydrous diethyl ether, anhydrous sodium thiosulfate,
methylene chloride stabilized, sodium hydroxide (97%), toluene, methanol,
ethyl acetate, and 37% hydrochloric acid were purchased from Fisher
Chemicals and used without further modification. Acetonitrile was
purchased from Spectrum and used without further modification. Sodium
sulfate was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used without further modification.
All solvents were dried and purified by using the standard procedures.

4.2 Characterization
1H NMR
was recorded on a 300 MHz/52 MM Bruker Cryomadnet NMR (USA, coil#
244 30 67G) spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. 1H NMR chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm)
relative to CDCl3 (7.26). Reactions were monitored by thin-layer
chromatography performed on Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.2 mm plates (Merck)
with visualization under UV light (254 or 366 nm). DSC measurements
were conducted with a DSC Q100 instrument. All samples (250–350
mg) were subjected to two heating–cooling cycles at the ramp
rate of 10 °C/min under a flow of nitrogen in aluminum pans.
GPC/static light scattering: The GPC/SEC system consists of Shimadzu’s
solvent delivery unit; the column heater includes PL gel 5 μm
mixed-D columns from Polymer Laboratories Ltd. for size-exclusive
separation, connected also to a miniDAWN Tristar light scattering
detector (Wyatt). An Optilab DSP interferometric refractometer (Wyatt)
was used to determine the average molecular weight of the polymer
with a range from 200 to over 1 000 000 g/mole. The
miniDAWN Tristar is a multiangle laser light scattering photometer
containing two photodiodes to monitor the laser beam intensity. The
light source was a 30 mW semiconductor diode laser with a wavelength
of 690 nm. Measurements of molecular weight (Mw): polymers were prepared in a 100.00 mL volumetric flask
(grade A, 100.00 mL ± 0.08) by weighing approximately 0.10000

carried out according to the literature.18,70

4.3.1 Synthesis of Arenediazonium Tetrafluoroborate
Salt of 2,2-(4-Hydroxy-4′-aminodiphenyl)propane (3)
Boron trifluoride etherate (17.73 g, 0.1250 mol) was added
to compound 2 (18.87 g, 0.0830 mol) in an anhydrous THF
(120 mL). Prior to addition of the amine, the boron trifluoride etherate
was cooled at −15 °C in an ice-acetone bath. tert-Butyl nitrite (10.21 g, 0.0991 mol) was added dropwise to the rapidly
