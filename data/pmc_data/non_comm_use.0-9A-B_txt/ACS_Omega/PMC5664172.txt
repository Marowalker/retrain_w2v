Most drugs are small molecules because
of their attractive pharmacokinetics,
manageable development and manufacturing, and effective binding into
the concave crevices of bio-macromolecules. Despite these features,
they often fall short when it comes to effectively recognizing the
surfaces of bio-macromolecules. One way to overcome the challenge
of biomolecular surface recognition is to develop small molecules
that become self-assembled ligands (SALs) prior to binding. Herein,
we report SALs made from 8-aryl-2′-deoxyguanosine derivatives
forming precise hydrophilic supramolecular G-quadruplexes (SGQs) with
excellent size, shape, and charge complementarity to G-quadruplex
DNA (QDNA). We show that only those compounds forming SGQs act as
SALs, which in turn differentially stabilize QDNAs from selected oncogene
promoters and the human telomeric regions. Fluorescence resonance
energy-transfer melting assays are consistent with spectroscopic,
calorimetric, and light scattering studies, showing the formation
of a “sandwichlike” complex QDNA·SGQ·QDNA.
These results open the door for the advent of SALs that recognize
QDNAs and potentially the surfaces of other bio-macromolecules such
as proteins.

Introduction
Historically,
the development of small-molecule ligands has been
the major focus of pharmacology and chemical biology because they
are ideally suited to bind to concave crevices such as receptor pockets
and the active sites of enzymes. A small size generally also improves
the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and cell permeability and
enables standard pharmaceutical manufacturing practices. When it comes
to recognizing bio-macromolecular surfaces, however, small molecules
often fall short of their desired affinity and specificity unless
the macromolecule has a so-called “hot spot” on its
surface.1,2 In general, small molecules simply lack
the affinity and selectivity toward the mostly flat (convex) surfaces
of bio-macromolecules such as proteins.3 Targeting a small concave cavity with a small molecule is feasible
because in the drug design process, the contact surface area can be
readily maximized. Once inside a pocket, a small molecule is shielded
from the constant jostling by solvent molecules, to a much greater
extent than what would be apparent on a molecular surface.

Successful
strategies for bio-macromolecular surface recognition
include the use of large structures such as antibodies, nucleic acids
such as aptamers,5,6 or nanoparticles.7−10 The larger size of these nanostructures enables a larger binding
surface area and multivalent interactions. However, is it possible
to cover large portions of bio-macromolecular surfaces using small
molecules as building blocks for SALs?

What is an inherent SAL?
It is the one whose supramolecular structure
is dictated by the information encoded in its subunits, preferably
one which is precise. Every supramolecular assembly has a critical
(or lower) self-assembly concentration, which is defined as the concentration
at which half of the subunits are in the assembled state.11,12 It is, thus, valuable to develop inherent SALs whose formation occurs
in a highly cooperative process, to maximize their selectivity, affinity,
and other critical attributes. The more cooperative the self-assembly
process, the sharper the transition between monomer and assembly with
a drastic nonlinear change in a relatively narrow concentration range.
Cooperative self-assembly favors the formation of specific supramolecular
structures, and it can arise from allosteric effects and/or from mutually
supporting molecular surfaces.13,14

The strategy
we present here to develop inherent SALs relies on
small molecules that “grow” before reaching their target
(Figure 1A). There
is some precedent for “conditional” SALs (Figure 1B) where the simultaneous binding
of small molecules as aggregates (e.g., dimers and trimers) happens
only in the presence of targets such as the active sites of proteins15 or the groove of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).16 However, such systems generally do not form
precise supramolecular assemblies prior to binding their target,17 resulting in poor selectivity if the interactions
between the subunits are weak or ambiguous. An ideal (inherent) SAL
should be stable enough prior to binding to ensure good affinity and
selectivity, especially when targeting a biomolecular surface. Affinity
and selectivity could then be fine-tuned as in traditional drug development
strategies [e.g., structure–activity relationship (SAR)]. Herein,
we report the development of inherent SALs for QDNA formed via the
self-assembly of 8ArG derivatives into SGQs (Figure 1C,D). We also provide the structural characterization
of the supramolecular complex formed between a QDNA and an SGQ acting
as an SAL, which provides critical insights into the specific noncovalent
interactions driving the complex formation.

Guanine-rich DNA sequences able
to form QDNA structures are abundant
on the telomeres and the promoter regions of some oncogenes.18−22 They are attractive pharmacological targets because of their putative
role in the regulation of cellular processes such as replication and
cell survival. The development of ligands that bind QDNA with high
selectivity and affinity remains a challenge that must be overcome
to make QDNAs a viable target for pharmacological intervention.18,23−26 Effective QDNA ligands must differentiate a desired target QDNA
from dsDNAs and from alternative QDNA structures adopting different
topologies (Figure 4).27−32 The search for viable QDNA ligands ranges from a wide variety of
small molecules to more innovative designs such as conditional SALs
where a QDNA templates the organization of ligands on top of the G-tetrads
exposed to the solvent.27−37 In the strategy described above, the size of a single molecule of
a G-derivative such as 1 is not large enough to cover
significant portions of the surface of a QDNA (Figure 1E). By contrast, upon self-assembly, the
resulting SGQ having its analogous exposed flat G-tetrads enables
the formation of more effective complexes (Figure 1D) between QDNA structures and the inherent
SALs reported in here.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembly Studies of
Hydrophilic 8ArG Derivatives
In aqueous media, successful
self-assembly of precise (discrete and
well-defined) supramolecules held together by noncovalent interactions
is very challenging. We have reported that in H2O/D2O (9:1) with at least 5 mM KCl, compound 1 forms
the hexadecameric SGQ 116 in contrast to 2, which does not self-assemble under these conditions (i.e.,
at or below low millimolar concentrations) because of the lack of
the meta-carbonyl phenyl group attached to the C8 of the guanine moiety.4,38 Compound 3 is a new derivative of 1, synthesized
to evaluate the impact of longer ester chains to their self-assembly
into SGQs and the subsequent binding to QDNAs.

The propensity
of compounds 1–4 (prepared as previously reported4,38,39 and as described in the Supporting Information) to self-assemble into
SGQs in buffer solutions similar to those used in the fluorescence
resonance energy-transfer (FRET) melting assays (e.g., 10 mM LCB)
was investigated using a combination of 1H NMR (Figures 2 and S18–S21), dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Figure 3A), and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure 3B). Under potassium buffer conditions (LCB with 100
mM KCl and 4 mM 8ArGs), the 1H NMR signatures as well as
the relative hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) and thermodynamic stability determined by DLS and DSC confirm that
only 1 and 3 self-assemble into SGQs 116 (Dh = 4.7 nm) and 316 (Dh = 5.0 nm),
whereas 2 (Dh = 1.2 nm) and 4 (Dh = 1.9) remain as monomers.40 An additional test to compare the propensity
of 8ArGs to self-assemble into SGQs is to replace the promoting cation
from potassium to sodium in the buffer. The latter is less efficient
at promoting the formation of SGQs,41 resulting
in a shift in the equilibrium away from the hexadecameric SGQs 116 and 316. 1H NMR spectra reveal that in sodium buffer (LCB with 100 mM NaCl
and 4 mM 8ArGs), both 2 and 4 remain as
monomers, whereas 1 and 3 self-assemble
into SGQs, albeit with a larger proportion of octameric SGQs, specifically,
89% for 18 and 37% for 38, which relative to potassium buffer represents an increase
of 21 and 9%, respectively. Given that both 2 and 4 remain as monomers in the concentration range tested, they
were suitable controls in the QDNA-binding studies.

in the Kekulé structures, respectively. (Bottom) 1H NMR spectra of 8ArGs (5 mM) were measured in 10 mM lithium cacodylate

show the regions of the N1H and the sugar where red highlights the
signals of hexadecamer species38 and light
blue highlights those of octamer species. Compounds 2 and 4 show no evidence of self-assembly at the concentrations
shown. The meaning of the subscripts in the peak labels is as follows:
W = Watson–Crick edge; o = outer tetrads; and i = inner tetrads.

Figure 3 (A) Hydrodynamic diameter (Dh in nm)
measured by DLS and (B) DSC endotherms in 10 mM LCB with 100 mM KCl.
Samples were 4 mM 1–4, and the main species in
solution were SGQs for 1 and 3 and monomers
(Mon.) for 2 and 4.

Because SGQs have a lower self-assembly concentration in
the micromolar
range where the FRET assays were performed, it is critical to determine
if they were present in significant amounts or if the equilibrium
was shifted mostly to the monomeric subunits. The thiazole orange
(TO) fluorescence enhancement assay is an attractive way to gain further
insights into this issue, considering the sensitivity limitations
of NMR in that concentration range. TO fluorescence enhancement assay,
which is widely used to track the binding of ligands to QDNA,42,43 is nonfluorescent when free in solution but becomes highly fluorescent
upon complexation with QDNA because of the restricted rotations that
limit nonradiative energy dissipation. In a similar fashion, we hypothesized
that TO could report on the presence of SGQs, given some of their
shared features with QDNAs. Fluorescence measurements of TO with and
without 2 (120 μM) show no enhancement, which contrasts
with a fourfold enhancement in the presence of equal amounts of 3 (Figure S43). We hypothesize
that the smaller magnitude of the enhancement, relative to that reported
for polyanionic QDNAs, is, in part, because of the Coulombic repulsion
expected for the cationic TO binding to the polycationic SGQ. Nonetheless,
this enhancement is consistent with the presence of SGQs, which offer
a large solvent-exposed area suitable for binding.

Can 8ArG SGQs
Selectively Stabilize QDNA Structures?
The samples of 1–4 (5 mM in LCB with 100 mM NaCl)
used for NMR analysis were diluted to 64 μM and used in a FRET
melting assay with the QDNA sequence derived from the human telomeric
sequence (hTelo) (Figure 4A). The rationale for using Na+ instead of K+ was to test the hypothesis that only the
more robust SGQs would stabilize the hTelo QDNA structure. The experimental
data validate this hypothesis because the stabilization of the QDNAs
follows the same trend as the propensity of compounds 1–4 to self-assemble into SGQs. Specifically, compound 3, which forms the most stable SGQ, stabilized the hTelo QDNA with
ΔT1/2 of ∼9 °C, whereas
compound 1, which forms a less stable SGQ, resulted in
a smaller stabilization (ΔT1/2 =
1 °C) of the same QDNA. By contrast, compounds 2 and 4, which under these conditions do not self-assemble
into SGQs, destabilized the hTelo QDNA instead. This destabilization
might result from the alternative interactions with the loops and/or
grooves or even direct competition between the G-derivatives and the
guanine moieties in the QDNAs. The importance of an SGQ acting as
an inherent SAL toward the hTelo QDNA is underscored by the following:
(a) because 1 and 4 are isomers, the lack
of stabilization by the latter demonstrates the importance of the
stereochemical arrangement of the carbonyl group (meta vs para) and
the corresponding SGQ formation (Figure 4A) and (b) in 1 and 3, both of which have a meta-carbonyl phenyl moiety, the degree of
stabilization is directly proportional to the inherent stability of
the corresponding SGQs in NaCl buffer (Figures 2 and 4).

Figure 4 Stabilization

0.5 μM ODN in 10 mM LCB with (B) 10 mM KCl/90 mM LiCl (hTelo), 1 mM KCl/99 mM LiCl (c-MYC and c-KIT2 oncogenes), and (A,C) 100 mM NaCl. In some cases,
the ΔT1/2 values for 2 or the error bars on the graphs are too small to notice. The molecular
models that show the main topologies adopted by hTelo, c-MYC, and
c-KIT2 in K+-buffer were prepared from the pdb codes 1KF1,491XAV,50 and 2KYP, respectively. The structure of hTelo
in Na+ buffer was prepared from the pdb code 143D.

In addition to hTelo, we evaluated if the SGQs
formed by 1 or 3 could interact and stabilize
the QDNA
structures derived from the promoter regions of the oncogenes c-MYC (FmycT) and c-KIT2 (Fkit2T)44,45 in various buffers, with compound 2 serving as a negative
control (i.e., no SGQ formation) for FRET melting assays. These sequences
enable the evaluation of the binding of SGQs as a function of their
structural and topological features (Figure 4B,C). FRET melting profiles in LCB, with
NaCl or KCl, demonstrate that 3 and, to a lesser extent, 1 differentially stabilize QDNA structures in a dose-dependent
manner (Figures S25–S27), in contrast
with compound 2, which shows no significant stabilization.
The highest stabilization by 1 and 3 (64
μM), respectively, was observed for the structure of F21T in
K+ buffer (ΔT1/2 ≈
12 and 15 °C) and for FmycT in Na+ buffer (ΔT1/2 ≈ 10 and 13 °C). However, only 3 significantly stabilized the QDNA structures for both hTelo
(in Na+ buffer) and c-KIT2 (in both K+ and Na+ buffer), which highlights a selectivity for different QDNA
topologies. For FmycT in Na+ buffer, the slightly larger
stabilization induced by 3 over 1 (ΔT1/2 ≈ 13 and 10 °C, respectively)
and the greater steepness of the melting curves suggest a more cooperative
dissociation of the resulting complexes formed by the putative SGQs
made by 1 or 3 with these QDNAs.46 The corresponding measurements for 1 in Li+ buffer, by contrast, showed no significant stabilization
of either of the QDNAs47,48 or the SGQs.41

To determine if the observed behavior resulted primarily
from simple
electrostatic interactions, we compared 3 and 2 as representative G-derivatives with, respectively, the highest
and lowest propensity to self-assemble into SGQs. Neither 3 nor 2 imparted significant stabilizations of the dsDNA
(Figures S39 and S43). This indicates that
neither electrostatic complementarity alone nor additional nonspecific
interactions drive the complexation of 3 to QDNA, but
instead is its higher propensity to form SGQs that act as SALs.

We hypothesize that the observed selectivity (Figure 4B,C) results from specific
interactions between the ester side chains in the SGQs formed by 1 and 3 with the loops of the various QDNAs tested.
For example, under potassium buffer conditions (Figure 4B), 1 leads to greater discrimination
than 3 despite the greater stabilization induced by the
latter. The greater flexibility enabled by the longer side chains
in compound 3 can adjust to the various topologies adopted
by the QDNAs, which in turn results in a lower degree of discrimination.

Although the FRET melting assays provide compelling support for
the SGQs acting as SALs for QDNAs, to further support this hypothesis,
we performed a series of NMR experiments using a simplified tetramolecular
QDNA formed by the hTelo sequence 5′-TTAGGG-3′.51 The rationale for using a simplified QDNA structure
is as follows: (a) a lower complexity of the spectra facilitates their
interpretation; (b) higher overall symmetry enhances the signal-to-noise
ratio; (c) because the selected QDNA dimerizes (via its 3′
end), disruption of the dimer (QDNA2) provides a convenient
way to track the formation of the complex as has been reported for
small-molecule ligands;51−53 and (d) intercalation of the
SGQ into QDNA2 to form a QDNA·SGQ·QDNA complex
would likely preserve an overall high symmetry, which also simplifies
the spectral interpretation.

The spectra for the N1H “imino”
groups in QDNA2 (4.7 mM ssDNA concentration, 50 mM potassium
buffer pH 7.05,
300 mM KCl, and 90:10 of H2O/D2O) show three sets of signals
corresponding to the consecutive imino hydrogens from G6, G5, and
G4 at 10.5, 10.9, and 11.3 ppm, respectively (Figure 5Ai).52 Addition
of a single equivalent of 1 leads to the disruption of
the 1H NMR spectrum of QDNA2 (Figure 5Aii), which after adding a
second equivalent reveals the signals corresponding to SGQ 116 (Figure 5Aiii).38 After equilibrating for 48 h,
the spectrum shows a new species with three sets of signals from QDNAs
(G4, G5, and G6) and two from the SGQ 116,
intercalated in between (Figures 5Aiv and 6A). These results provided
the first indication of the formation of a “sandwichlike”
complex of general formula QDNA·116·QDNA,
which is further supported by the DSC, DLS, and 2D NMR measurements
discussed below.

Figure 5 NMR, DSC, and DLS experiments are consistent with the
formation
of a sandwich complex. (A) 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra for

complex (4.5 mM ssDNA) in 78 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0,
467 mM KCl, 90:10 of H2O/D2O. The meaning of
the subscripts in the peak labels in part A are: M = monomer; g =
groove edge; WC = Watson–Crick edge; o = outer tetrads; and
i = inner tetrads.

complex. All models were prepared with Maestro 9.3 and minimized by
MacroModel using the OPLS2005 force field. For the meaning of the
subscripts, see the caption of Figure 5.

DSC measurements (Figure 5C) are consistent
with the formation of a QDNA·116·QDNA
complex (1.4 mM in ssDNA and 3.2
mM in 1) of greater thermodynamic stability than its
individual constituents QDNA2 (1.4 mM in ssDNA) and 116 (3.3 mM in 1). The DSC thermogram
reveals two main transitions, suggesting a stepwise dissociation of
the QDNA·116·QDNA complex into two
putative intermediate species of general formula QDNA·1n4 (where n = 1–3).
The half-height of the peak (T1/2), corresponding
to the QDNA·116·QDNA complex, is
narrower than those of both QDNA2 and 116, a strong indication of a more cooperative dissociation
of the former.54 The enhanced stability
and cooperativity are likely the result of conformational adaptability
and the large number of attractive noncovalent interactions between
the components in the QDNA·116·QDNA
complex.

DLS experiments indicate the QDNA·116·QDNA complex has a hydrodynamic diameter of 5.8
nm (Figure 5D), which
agrees
with that (5.6 nm) obtained from the molecular model (Figures 6 and S45). The corresponding Dh values for the
individual components, QDNA2 (3.6 nm) and SGQ 116 (4.8 nm), are also in good agreement with those of
the molecular models of 3.6 and 5.0 nm, respectively. The diameter
of the QDNA·116·QDNA complex is
smaller than the result of a simple addition of its individual constituents
because of the interpenetration of the corresponding hydrodynamic
spheres driven by attractive noncovalent interactions. This is also
consistent with the molecular model (Figures 6 and S45), which
shows a compact structure with significant interpenetration of each
individual QDNA component within the hydrodynamic shell of the SGQ 116.

The 2D NOESY spectrum of a sample containing
2 equiv of 1 (t48h; Figure 5Aiv) has one set
of broad signals with NOE
correlations, revealing interactions between QDNA2 and
the SGQ 116 (Figures 5B and S44). Specifically,
there are multiple NOE correlations, indicating interactions between
the G6 tetrad in the QDNA and the subunits in the outer tetrads (1o) of the SGQ 116 such
as (i) 1o/N1H with G6/N1H; (ii) 1o/N2HWC (WC = Watson–Crick edge) with
G6/H8; and (iii) G6/H2β′ (Figure 5B) with 1o/N2HWC and multiple hydrogens of the aromatic group at the C8 of the guanines
in the outer tetrads of 116 such as 1o/H13, 1o/H15, 1o/H14, and 1o/H11. The NOE correlations
are consistent with a system where the outer tetrads (1o) of the SGQ 116 interacts with
a QDNA having all anti glycosidic bonds (at least
for G4–G6) and the individual strands adopting a right-handed
helix.51

Combining our NMR data with
those for the reported NMR structure
of QDNA2,51−53 we constructed a model for QDNA2 and the
QDNA·116·QDNA complex using Maestro
9.3 and minimized it by MacroModel with the OPLS2005 force field (Figures 6 and S45). The QDNA dimer has a 3′–3′
interface (tail-to-tail) (Figures 6, S45, and S46) with opposite
polarity between the strands with the sugars of the two G6 tetrads
at the interface pointing in opposite directions. For both, QDNA2 and the QDNA·116·QDNA complex,
within each QDNA subunit, the strands have the same polarity, the
tetrads are in a head-to-tail arrangement, and the sugars are directed
in the same direction (Figure S46). In
the QDNA·116·QDNA complex, the tail
of the outer tetrad of the SGQ, 14(o), interacts
with the tail of the G6 tetrad. Thus, the interaction at the interface
between the QDNA and the SGQ leads to a partial overlap between the
bases with opposite polarities (Figures 6C, S45, and S46). In 14(o), the proximity of the ribose
O6 to the N2Hg (g = groove edge) in G6 allows the formation
of intertetrad H-bonds that stabilize the QDNA·116·QDNA complex. The complex is also stabilized by
the attractive Coulombic interactions between the polycationic 116 and the polyanionic QDNA2, which
results in a net charge of +1 for the complex. The molecular model
of QDNA·116·QDNA shows that many
of the cationic ammonium groups at the end of the ester chains of 1 accommodate within the grooves of the QDNA subunits in close
contact with the phosphate backbone.

Conclusions
The
results presented here showcase the possibility of using 8ArGs
to develop SALs for QDNA structures. This strategy is akin to fragment-based
drug discovery methods, but one in which the fragments are connected
using noncovalent interactions. Some of the attractive features of
using SGQs as SALs include their precise supramolecular structure
and their capacity to recognize relatively flat molecular surfaces.
These findings are also amenable to SAR studies to optimize the binding
for specific targets. Furthermore, because the recognition of protein
surfaces shares similar challenges, it is conceivable that the presented
strategy could be adapted to these purposes, and efforts along these
lines are already showing promise.55

Experimental
Procedures
General Methods
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents
and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without
further purification. Column chromatography was performed using silica
gel 60, 0.04–0.063 mm (from Sorbent Technologies). For thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) analysis, silica gel 60 F254 glass-backed plates
from Sorbent Technologies were used. Visualization of the TLC plates
was effected with UV light. All compounds were characterized with 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR techniques such as 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy and/or 1H–13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence.
All chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to
the residual undeuterated solvent as an internal reference. The following
abbreviations are used to explain the multiplicities: s, singlet;
d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; and b, broad.

General NMR Methods
NMR experiments were recorded on
(1) a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm PABBO
BB-1 H/D Z-GRD probe with a nominal frequency of 400.15 MHz for proton;
(2) a Bruker AVANCE AV-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm PABBO
probe with nominal frequencies of 500.13 MHz for proton and 125.76
MHz for carbon; or (3) a Bruker AVANCE III Ascend Aeon 700 MHz spectrometer
equipped with a 5 mm cryoprobe with nominal frequencies of 700.26
MHz for proton and 176.08 MHz for carbon. The 1H NMR water
suppression experiments were done in H2O/D2O
(9:1), and sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 was used as the internal standard to calibrate the spectra
at 0 ppm. For each sample, the more suitable water suppression experiments
were used, either (1) standard presaturation pulse sequence with the
excitation frequency set above the water peak around 4.7 ppm or (2)
standard excitation sculpting technique.

DLS Experiments
Measurements of the hydrodynamic diameter
(Dh) of the species in solution were done
at 25 °C using the globular protein parameter. Prior to measurements,
samples were centrifuged in a Daigger Mini-Centrifuge model Sprout,
and then 0.30 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a quartz
ultra micro cell. For the analysis of compounds 1–4 (4 mM) in 10 mM LCB with 100 mM KCl, a Zetasizer Nano ZS model ZEN3600
from Malvern with a 4 mW laser of 632.8 nm wavelength at a backscatter
angle of 173° was used. The instrument software was Malvern Zetasizer
version 7.10. For the analysis of QDNA2, SGQ 116, and the QDNA·116·QDNA
system in 78 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 467 mM KCl,
a Brookhaven Instruments BI-90 Plus particle size analyzer with a
diode laser at a scattering angle of 90°, a wavelength of 657
nm, and a laser power of 40% was used.

DLS measurements were
done for the samples of QDNA2 dimer (4.5 mM ssDNA), 116 (5 mM 1), and the supramolecular
complex (4.5 mM ssDNA) in 78 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0
with 467 mM KCl and 90:10 of H2O/D2O. The sample
with the supramolecular complex was also used for its NMR characterization.

DSC Experiments
The experiments were performed on a
VP-DSC microcalorimeter from MicroCal, and Origin (v.7) was used for
data processing. Measurements were made using a heating rate of 1
°C/min. All samples were centrifuged in a Daigger Mini-Centrifuge
model Sprout and degassed prior to their transference to the DSC instrument.
The thermodynamic stability of the species formed by compounds 1–4 (4 mM 1) was evaluated in 10 mM LCB
with 100 mM KCl. For the structural analysis of SGQ 116 as a SAL for QDNA2, DSC measurements were
done for QDNA2 (1.4 mM ssDNA), SGQ 116 (3.3 mM 1), and the QDNA·116·QDNA complex (1.4 mM ssDNA and 3.2 mM 1) in 78
mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 467 mM KCl and 90:10 of
H2O/D2O.

Measurement of TO Fluorescence
Spectra
The samples
evaluated have 10.7 μM TO with or without 120 μM 8ArG,
in 10 mM LCB with 10 mM KCl and 90 mM LiCl. We chose the concentration
of 120 μM 8ArG because it is also the concentration of 8ArGs
in the stock solution used for the dose–response FRET melting
assays. Therefore, the samples were prepared as described below within
the subsection titled “Buffered Solutions of the ODNs and of
8ArGs”. The only modification to this procedure is that at
the end of the sample preparation, the TO was added from a stock solution
of TO in dimethyl sulfoxide (2 mM). All fluorescence measurements
were made using the spectrofluorophotometer RF-5301PC from Shimadzu
(λex = 501 nm, emission range = 518–720 nm,
at ∼25 °C).

FRET Melting Assays
Oligonucleotide Stock Solutions
in Deionized Water
All oligonucleotides were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich as reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)-purified. The lyophilized
ODNs were dispersed in deionized water, and the absorbance of a dilute
sample at 260 nm (after 5–10 min at 90 °C) was measured.
The experimental concentrations of the stock solutions were calculated
using the average value of the absorbance, a cell path length value
of 10 mm, and the ODN molar extinction coefficients reported by the
supplier, ε (M–1 cm–1):
215 000 (F21T), 236 800 (FmycT), 199 100 (Fkit2T),
and 258 900 (FduplexT). The DNA sequences used on the FRET
melting assays were modified at the 5′ and 3′ end with
6FAM (F) and TAMRA (T), respectively. F21T: FAM-G3TTAG3TTAG3TTAG3-TAMRA, FmycT: FAM-TTGAG3TG3TAG3TG3TAA-TAMRA, and
Fkit2T: FAM-G3CG3CGCGAG3AG4-TAMRA.

Buffered Solutions of the
ODNs and of 8ArGs
All solutions
for 8ArGs (∼120 μM) and the ODNs (∼4 μM)
were in 10 mM LCB with KCl/LiCl (10 mM/90 mM or 1 mM/99 mM), 100 mM
NaCl, or 100 mM LiCl. The solutions were prepared by mixing the DNA
or 8ArGs, from a stock solution in deionized water with aliquots from
stock solutions of LCB (100 mM), KCl (100 mM), NaCl (1 M), or LiCl
(1 M) and additional deionized water. K+-containing solution
in LCB with 10 mM KCl/90 mM LiCl was prepared for F21T, FduplexT,
and selected 8ArGs. For FmycT, Fkit2T, and also selected 8ArGs, K+-containing solutions in LCB were prepared with 1 mM KCl/99
mM LiCl which is the suggested KCl concentration for oncogene sequences.56 The samples of the ODNs were subsequently submitted
to the protocol described below to promote the DNA folding into the
corresponding QDNA or dsDNA structures. The samples of 8ArGs were
stored in the refrigerator for at least 2 h before their use in the
FRET melting assays.

DNA Folding into QDNA Structures
To induce the folding
of the oligonucleotides into unimolecular QDNAs, the K+-, Na+-, and Li+-containing solutions of F21T,
FmycT, and Fkit2T were heated at 90 °C for 5–10 min, kept
on ice for ∼7 h, and then stored in the refrigerator (4 °C)
for at least 12 h.

Protocol for FRET Melting Assays57,58
The
final K+-, Na+-, and Li+-containing
samples were prepared on a 105 μL scale by diluting the ODNs
(F21T, FmycT, or Fkit2T) up to 0.5 μM and adding different concentrations
of 8ArGs (0.5–64 μM) from the corresponding buffered
solution.

FRET assays were performed as a high-throughput screen
in a 96-well plate using a total sample volume of 25 μL, using
a Stratagene MX3005P real-time PCR (qPCR) instrument. For the melting
profiles after excitation at 492 nm, the emission of FAM at 520 nm
was monitored from 25 to 95 °C. The samples were left stabilizing
for 1 min at 25 °C, and the temperature was increased by 1 °C
for 70 cycles, with an average end-point measurement of the temperature
(average from three measurements). Analysis of the data was done using
Excel and OriginPro8 to normalize the emission of FAM between 0 and
1. T1/2 is defined as the temperature
for which the normalized emission is 0.5, and the values are the mean
of 2–4 experiments.

NMR Studies for the Formation
of a Complex between 1 and a Dimeric QDNA Structure
General
Experimental Details
All NMR analyses were
performed using Shigemi NMR tubes. The nanopure water and buffer used
for the preparation of all samples were filtered through Fisherbrand
0.45 μm nylon syringe filters. The DNA sequence 5′-d(TTAGGG)-3′
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as RP-HPLC-purified, and concentration
values were calculated from the nanomoles reported on the technical
data provided by Aldrich.

Formation of the Dimeric QDNA Species
To prepare the
DNA stock solution, the DNA was dispersed in concentrated potassium
buffer with KCl (pH ≈ 7), nanopure water, and D2O. The resulting solution was kept at 10–11 mM of the DNA
strand to promote the formation and dimerization of the tetramolecular
QDNAs. This process was monitored by 1H NMR analysis.

Preparation of Samples for the Titration, DLS, and DSC Experiments
Once it is confirmed by NMR that the main species in the DNA stock
solution is the dimer of tetramolecular QDNA structures, we proceed
to dilute the sample to reach 4.5–5.0 mM DNA and divided the
sample into two fractions with equal amounts of the QDNA dimer. One
fraction is for the direct analysis of the QDNA dimer species by DLS
and DSC experiments. The other fraction of the QDNA dimer is used
for the titration experiment.

Titration of 1 into a Sample of the QDNA Dimer
In a typical titration
experiment, before the addition of aliquots
of compound 1, the sample that originally only has the
QDNA dimer species is freeze-dried and suspended in H2O/D2O (9:1). The process of freeze drying, resuspension, increasing
the amount of compound 1, and NMR analysis were repeated
for subsequent data points in the titration experiment. Once the supramolecular
complex had fully formed (Figure 5Aiv), further NMR, DLS, and DSC experiments were performed.

Molecular Modeling
General Methods
The molecular models
were constructed
using Maestro v. 9.5 and minimized with MacroModel v. 8.0.315 (both
form Schrodinger, LLC, New York, 2007) using the force field OPLS2005
and water as the continuum solvent. The details for the construction
and structural analysis of SGQ 116 were previously
reported by our research group4,38 and used as the starting
point to create the molecular model of SGQ 316, 38.

Molecular Models for the
Structures of the QDNA Dimer and the
Supramolecular Complex
The “initial structure”
for the molecular model was prepared by removing the thymines and
adding the corresponding OHs to the first structure in the pdb 1NP9.52,53 The constructed molecular structure of QDNA2 was created
by using two entries of the initial structure and applying the necessary
rotations and alignments to minimize repulsive interactions. Construction
of the model for the supramolecular complex QDNA·116·QDNA was made by combining the constructed molecular
model of the QDNA2 and the model of SGQ 116 which was developed by our research group,4 followed by the necessary rotations and alignments. Each
molecular model was minimized with MacroModel, the force field OPLS2005,
water as the continuum solvent, and constrains applied to all guanines
and metals.
