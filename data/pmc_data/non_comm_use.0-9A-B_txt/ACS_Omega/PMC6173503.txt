Understanding protein aggregation
is of utmost importance as it
is responsible for causing several neurodegenerative diseases and
one of the serious impediments in large-scale biopharmaceutical production.
The prion protein is responsible for pathological states in fatal
transmissible spongiform conditions, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The peptide fragment
178–191 of Syrian hamster prion protein is known to be amyloidogenic.
Here, we identified the fragment 179CVNITV184 as an aggregation-prone fragment in sheep prion protein. This fragment
is conserved sequence among sheep and Syrian hamster prion protein
and also falls in the previously identified amyloidogenic sequence.
The mechanistic details of the aggregation behavior are analyzed in
three different concentrations of urea, arginine, and ethanol. Urea
and arginine are found to be aggregation suppressors, but ethanol
enhances the protein aggregation through β-sheet formation.
We have also analyzed the influence of these osmolyte on water dynamics
in the presence of the octamer of this aggregation-prone fragment
and correlated this water dynamics with the aggregation behavior of
the octamer.

Introduction
Several neurodegenerative
diseases, such as prion disease, Alzheimer’s
disease, cystic fibrosis, etc., are known to be caused by protein
aggregation.1 Understanding the mechanistic
details of protein aggregation is extremely significant not only for
biopharmaceutical/biotechnological industries, but also in understanding
more than 40 neurodegenerative diseases.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) is the infectious spongiform
encephalopathy or prion disease of domestic cattle. The BSE prion
is a contagious agent and causes variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease (vCJD) in humans after dietary exposure.2−5 Aggregates of prion protein (PrP)
are the pathological hallmark of prion disease. Here, we demonstrate
through simulations that how the aggregating fragment of sheep prion
protein gets influenced in the presence of co-solvent and how the
co-solvent shifts the compact ensembles of amyloidogenic protein to
an extended one, thus affecting the formation of aggregates. These
results lead to a considerable insight into aggregation of amyloidogenic
proteins.

The most common degradation pathway for protein is
protein aggregation.
Aggregation leads to a decrease in efficacy of protein drugs and could
elicit an immunological response.6−8 The prion protein (PrP)
is a naturally occurring polypeptide responsible for pathological
states in fatal transmissible spongiform conditions, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Many studies suggest
that not whole protein is responsible for determining its aggregation
tendency.9 It seems that protein aggregation
is mediated by short “aggregation-prone” peptide segments.10,11 These aggregation-prone regions of protein can be detected by utilizing
bioinformatics prediction tools based on physiochemical principles
(phenomenological models) or molecular simulation approaches.12 In a previous experimental study, four amyloidogenic
peptide fragments of Syrian hamster PrP are identified, viz., 109–122,
113–127, 178–191, and 202–218. Hence, in the
present study, we have identified aggregation-prone fragments in the
sheep prion protein (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1UW3) using aggregation
servers such as TANGO, AGGRESCAN, and PASTA. We found a common fragment 179CVNITV184 of sheep prion protein as aggregation-prone
fragment in the three servers used. For supporting the above-mentioned
bioinformatics tools, we have also used Zipper DB,13 a database that is basically designed for hexapeptide causing
aggregation within protein. According to Zipper DB database criteria,
hexapeptides forming aggregates must have a Rosetta (scoring function)
energy <−23 kcal/mol, and composite score (a score combining
Rosetta energy, shape complementary, and area of interface) must have
the lowest value among all fragments of protein. We found the CVNITV
fragment to have a Rosetta energy of −28.20 kcal/mol and a
composite score of −46.52, which is the lowest among all of
the fragments of sheep prion protein. Surprisingly, this result matches
with the experimentally identified aggregation-prone sequence in Syrian
hamster prion protein for its aggregation14 and it is the conserved sequence among these two proteins except
one, i.e., valine replaced by isoleucine.

Therefore, to get
further insights into the protein aggregation
mechanism of this hexapeptide, we performed molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation in water and in the presence of osmolytes such as urea,
arginine, and ethanol.

Urea has been known to be a strong denaturant
for proteins and
widely used in protein unfolding or refolding in vitro experiments.15 Because of the stronger dispersion interaction
between urea and protein over urea and water, urea has a stronger
denaturing power.16−29 Globular native proteins generally fully or partially unfold in
the presence of urea and adopt more extended structure.26,28 A similar behavior is observed for small unstructured polypeptides.28 On the other hand, to form β-sheets, protein–protein
interaction must be larger than hydrogen bond interaction formed between
urea and protein, which slows down the aggregation process in urea.
The two different behaviors of urea indicate that it can affect the
aggregation in a nonmonotonic way.

Further, an experimental
study was performed by Dobson and co-worker’s,30 where the effect of urea on aggregation of globular
protein β-lacto globulin has been shown. They observed a nonmonotonic
behavior of urea with change in concentration for the protein aggregation,
where an elaborate balance is achieved between promoting aggregation-prone
monomer and inhibiting interpeptide interaction. Hence, it becomes
more interesting to investigate whether this nonmonotonic behavior
of urea exists for aggregation of this small hexapeptide.

l-Arginine is found to be one of the most commonly used
aggregation suppressors of protein and hormones in vitro.31−33 In spite of having a series of progress with arginine and its derivatives
as an aggregation suppressor, the mechanism of its action is yet to
be identified.34 Arginine shows the best
result in preventing the aggregate formation by lysozyme, which is
used as a model protein under thermal stress and refolding pathway
from previously denatured state in comparison to other 14 amino acids.31

Shiraki and co-workers also reported preventive
action of arginine
toward aggregation with other eight kinds of proteins. Suppressive
behavior of arginine toward aggregation was found to be independent
of the size/or isoelectric point of proteins.31 With only minor effect on protein stability, arginine does not facilitate
refolding, but suppresses aggregation,35 while the solubility of aggregation-prone molecule is enhanced.
Different mechanisms have been put forward to understand the preventive
role of arginine in protein aggregation. Therefore, we have chosen
to investigate the aggregation behavior of this hexapeptide in the
presence of arginine.

Certain structural changes in protein
are also observed in ethanol–water
solution, and the degree of aggregation is found to be dependent on
the concentration of alcohol used. Ethanol is reported to induce protein
aggregation with increase in concentration in experimental results.36

In this work, we have selected the hexapeptide
of prion sheep protein
and performed the MD simulation of octamer of this fragment in water,
which forms molecular aggregates. The effects of osmolytes on these
fragments were monitored at varying concentrations.

Here, we
report the effect of external agents on the 179CVNITV184 prion protein conformation: (a) urea, an osmolyte
used to denature globular proteins through presumed perturbations
in peptide hydrogen bonding;37 (b) l-arginine, an osmolyte which has been widely used to suppress
protein aggregation;38 and (c) ethanol,
an osmolyte used to induce protein aggregation (depends on the type
of protein and the concentration of ethanol). The effect of these
agents on the 179CVNITV184 fragment is studied
using standard MD simulation at an isotropic pressure of 1 bar and
300 K temperature. The octamer simulation is expected to show early
onset of aggregation as the monomer simulation does not lead to the
formation of β-sheets (Figure S1).
The primary purpose of this study is to see the structural changes
taking place during aggregation and the influence of osmolyte concentrations
on aggregation, which could be helpful in giving insights into the
mechanistic details of the aggregation of proteins.

Results and Discussion
Prediction
of Aggregation-Prone Regions of Protein by Aggregation
Prediction Servers
Several prediction algorithms have been
developed depending on the physicochemical and biochemical properties
of the amino acids to predict amyloidogenic propensity from the polypeptide
sequence. We have used three servers, i.e., TANGO, AGGRESCAN, and
PASTA2.0, for prediction of aggregation-prone sequence in sheep prion
protein (PDB ID: 1UW3). TANGO, a statistical mechanics algorithm, was developed by Fernandez-Escamilla
et al.39 to predict the β-sheet aggregation
of proteins, which is different from amyloid fibril formation tendency,
but is highly correlated. Conchillo-Solé et al.40 developed AGGRESCAN, a natural amino acids aggregation
propensity scale derived from in vivo experiments. PASTA designed
by Trovato et al.41 looked for potential
β-strand pairs. More details about all of the three servers
are given in the Supporting Information. The results obtained from these bioinformatics servers were further
validated by protein database tool Zipper DB designed for prediction
of aggregation-prone hexapeptides.

We have used these servers
on prion sheep protein and found different aggregation-prone sequences
of this protein. Only single amino acid sequence, i.e., 179CVNITV184, was common among the predicted aggregation-prone
sequence of these three servers (Figure 1). This common aggregation sequence obtained
was in conformity to the experimental finding on Syrian hamster prion
protein.

Figure 1 Aggregation fragments of prion protein from various aggregations
prediction servers. The encircled region shows common fragments among
the three servers used.

In Syrian hamster prion protein (PDB ID: 1B10), several fragments
have been observed, which form amyloid fibrils, and these fragments
include residues 109–122, 113–127, 178–191, and
202–218.14 Therefore, one of the
predicted aggregation-prone sequences from the server matches with
the experimental result. The multiple sequence alignment has been
done using PRALINE,42 where valine is replaced
by isoleucine, which is another hydrophobic residue in the predicted
sequence (Figure 2).

sequence alignment of Syrian Hamster prion protein and
Sheep prion protein. The rectangular box highlights the common sequence
(except isoleucine in 1B10) in the two proteins.

We used this fragment, i.e., CVNITV, for our further analysis.

Standard molecular dynamics simulations were performed on eight
fragments of 179CVNITV184 of sheep prion protein
in the presence of water, urea, l-arginine, and ethanol.
System parameters for various simulations of octamer of CVNITV of
sheep prion protein are given in Table 1. Figure 3 summarizes simulation results in water on the octamer of prion fragment
CVNITV.

After simulation, several
analyses were performed. First, stability
of the protein during the simulation was checked using the DSSP program,
which shows the evolution of secondary structure with time, as described
by Kabsch and Sander rule.43 The β-sheet
contents of prion octamer in different osmolytes at various concentrations
have been calculated using the DSSP program44 (Figure 4). It has
been observed that the extent of β-sheet structure increases
with the passage of time in water. But a decrease in β-sheet
content is observed at 3 and 8 M urea concentrations. Expectedly at
5 M urea concentration, the β-sheet content increases. This
shows the nonmonotonic behavior of urea in peptide aggregation (Figure 4A). In case of arginine,
the β-sheet content goes on decreasing with increase in its
concentration (Figure 4B). But when the simulation is performed in ethanol, the extent of
β-sheet structure increases with increase in ethanol concentration
(Figure 4C), which
indicates that ethanol favors β-sheet formation with increase
in concentration.

Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Free-Energy Landscapes
(FELs)
Principal component analysis identifies significant
motion contributing to the overall dynamics of protein during the
entire simulation period. Here, protein dynamics is plotted for octamer
of prion protein in pure water and in different osmolytes at different
concentrations, i.e., urea (3, 5, 8 M), arginine (0.4, 0.8, 1.2 M),
and ethanol (4, 8, 12 M) in a frame called covariance matrix. Any
pronounced conformational deviation from the initial structure of
protein was captured by first two PCs.45 FEL analysis of Cα atom on first two PCs was computed along
the peptide backbone. Projection of two-dimensional free-energy surfaces
for oligomers was done onto the first two principal components of
Cα atoms. To get the diagonalized eigenvectors and eigenvalues,
covariance matrix was built on all of the Cα atoms using the
g_covar command of gromacs utility,44 which
denotes the directions of motion and mean fluctuations, respectively.
From the equilibrated portion of trajectories, the essential degree
of motion of all of the proteins were obtained to explore the dynamic
difference by projecting the motion of Cα atoms onto PCs (PC1
and PC2). The cosine content of principal components was also calculated
(Table 2) to validate
our simulation sampling. The value of cosine content lies between
0 and 1. The value of cosine content closer to 0 is a good indicator
of convergence and shows good sampling.46−49 Cosine content can be calculated
by the formula given below (eq 1) 1  where t is the instantaneous
time, ttot is the total simulation time,
and pi(t) is the ith
principal component at time t.

using g_anaeig and g_sham commands in gromacs.44

To understand the dynamics of oligomer in different
osmolytes with
different concentrations, the conformational space occupied by oligomer
in each osmolytes for the first two principal components (PC1 and
PC2) was analyzed. The different conformation of peptides in each
osmolyte shows that the extent of sampling varies a lot in each osmolyte
(Figure 5). The cosine
content of the first PCs was also calculated to check the quality
of analysis, as this analysis excludes the random diffusion of atoms
interpreted as correlated motion. Conformational changes taking place
during the MD simulation were also provided by the cosine content.
Cosine contents calculated for oligomer in all osmolytes at all concentrations
were found to be closer to zero (Table 2), which confirms actual conformational transitions
during the simulation.

M, and (J) ethanol 12 M along with the corresponding lowest energy
structures. The FELs were obtained using reaction coordinates of the
projection of peptide CVNITV Cα atoms onto the first two principal
components.

The area of FEL is an
estimate of the conformational dynamics traversed
during simulation. It was observed from FEL that, with increasing
concentration of osmolytes (urea and arginine), conformational space
occupied by peptides goes on increasing, which indicates relatively
more dynamic behavior at higher concentration, but in the case of
ethanol, conformational space occupied by peptides decreases with
increase in the concentration of ethanol, thus reducing the dynamics
of peptides. This might facilitate the formation of more β-sheets
in the case of ethanol (Figure 5), as confirmed by the DSSP plot of ethanol (Figure 4C).

Hence, the PCA analysis
showed that the dynamics of peptide during
the MD simulation is governed by large-scale collective motions of
oligomer in different osmolytes at different concentrations. The structural
properties of peptides can be extracted in terms of FELs from our
simulation in the case of each osmolyte at different concentrations.

Subsequently, from these FEL, lowest energy conformations were
obtained at each osmolyte concentration (Figure 5). In water, a single minimum is spotted
with a small region of free-energy surface, and the corresponding
structure showed two new antiparallel β-sheets at 57 ns during
simulation. The simulations in urea, arginine, and ethanol showed
significant conformational changes in the octamer structure. At 3
and 5 M urea concentrations, only a single minima was spotted at 71
and 73 ns, respectively, but at 8 M urea concentration, two minima
were observed at 68 and 71 ns. During this period of simulation in
8 M urea, the oligomers become less compact and peptides become more
extended compared to 3 and 5 M urea. At higher urea concentration,
the denaturation resulting in loss of secondary structure is predominant,
causing suppression of aggregation. But at moderate 5 M urea concentration,
it was observed that the extent of denaturation among the peptides
decreases and favors antiparallel β-sheet formation (Figure 5C). Overall, we observed
that increasing urea concentration can suppress the aggregation of
CVNITV peptides, but a nonmonotonic behavior is observed at a moderate
concentration of urea, i.e., 5 M.

Similarly, in the case of
arginine solution, complete inhibition
of β-sheet formation was observed compared to oligomers in water
(Figure 5A,E,F,G).
This is expected as arginine is known to be an antiaggregation osmolyte.35 At 1.2 M arginine concentration, four minima
were spotted in FEL, occupying the larger surface area compared to
other arginine concentrations. The corresponding structures to these
minima show that peptide gets farther apart from each other during
the simulation time.

In the case of ethanol solution, antiparallel
β-sheet content
of peptide increases with increase in ethanol concentration, and at
12 M ethanol concentration, seven out of eight peptides form the β-sheet
structure (Figure 5H–J).

Overall, we concluded that urea and arginine can
suppress the aggregation
of CVNITV peptides and ethanol favors the formation of β-sheet
and cause aggregation of protein. The above results were also confirmed
with the calculation of β-sheet content plot obtained from the
DSSP44 program of gromacs (Figure 4), the number of hydrogen bonds
formed between all peptide pairs (Figure 6), and radius of gyration, which shows the
compactness of peptides during the simulation periods (Figure 7).

Osmolyte Effect on CVNITV Peptide Aggregation
The effect
of osmolytes on the aggregation of CVNITV peptides was evaluated in
terms of the number of hydrogen bonds formed between all peptide pairs,
radius of gyration for the whole oligomer, and β-sheet structure
content obtained from the DSSP program. For each osmolyte at all concentrations,
three quantities were recorded with the evolution of time. First,
10 ns of all trajectories was discarded as equilibration time for
these calculations.

The number of hydrogen bonds formed between
pairs of peptides in each osmolyte can reflect the arrangement of
oligomer. Hydrogen bond formation occurs if the donor–acceptor
distance is less than 0.35 nm, and the donor hydrogen–acceptor
angle is larger than 150°. The average number of hydrogen bonds
between all pairs of peptides is 1.032 in pure water, and it decreases
to 0.582 in urea 3 M. Interestingly, the average number of hydrogen
bonds then slowly increases to 0.758 at the urea concentration of
5 M (Figure 6A). With
further increase in the concentration of urea, the average number
of hydrogen bonds between all pairs of peptides again decreases to
0.541 in 8 M urea. An increase in the number of hydrogen bonds observed
at 5 M urea shows the possibility of a slight enhancement for CVNITV
aggregation at this concentration.

With the addition of arginine
in water, the average number of hydrogen
bonds between all peptide pairs sharply decreases from 1.032 to 0.321
from pure water to arginine 0.4 M solution. And this number continuously
decreases from 0.211 to 0.20 with increase in the concentration of
arginine from 0.8 to 1.2 M, respectively (Figure 6B).

In the case of ethanol, at 4 M
ethanol concentration, the average
number of total hydrogen bonds formed between all peptide pairs is
found to be 0.716. With further increase in the concentration of ethanol,
this number increases to 0.89 and 0.97 at 8 and 12 M ethanol concentrations,
respectively (Figure 6C). The average number of hydrogen bonds is less than that of pure
water, but more β-sheets are formed in the case of ethanol.
Hence, we calculated the average number of interpeptide hydrogen bonds
for peptides that are getting converted to β-sheet (see Table S2). In the case of water, this value is
0.910, while in the case of ethanol, the values are 1.004, 1.051,
and 1.131 for 4, 8, and 12 M ethanol, respectively. This suggests
that with increase in the concentration of ethanol, the enhancement
in aggregation of CVNITV peptides occurs, which is in good agreement
with the PCA result discussed earlier.

The radius of gyration
has been calculated to ascertain the compactness
of the oligomers. Increasing radius of gyration is an indication of
swelling in oligomers. The average radius of gyration increases from
2.353 nm in pure water to 2.4 nm in 3 M urea, and this slight increase
in the radius of gyration might be because of the destabilization
of β-sheet, as shown in PCA results. At 5 M urea, it decreases
to 2.202 nm, which is again because of the small enhancement of the
β-sheet content. When the urea concentration is further increased
to 8 M, the radius of gyration sharply increases to 2.59 nm, which
suggests that oligomer is swelled and β-sheet is disfavored.
The decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds formed between all pairs
of peptide and the increase in the radius of gyration with increase
in concentration suggest that swelling of peptides is linked with
increase in the extent of urea–backbone interactions. Similarly,
the average radii of gyration of oligomer in arginine and ethanol
are also calculated (Figure 7B,C). With increase in arginine concentration, the average
radius of gyration increases from 2.35 nm in pure water to 2.751 nm
in arginine 0.4 M, 2.805 nm in arginine 0.8 M, and 2.875 in arginine
1.2 M (Figure 7B),
which indicates continuous extension and suppressed aggregation of
CVNITV peptide. In the case of 4 M ethanol, the radius of gyration
is 2.05 nm, which is less than that of water, i.e., 2.352 nm, indicating
favored β-sheet formation at this concentration. With further
increase in the concentration of ethanol, the radius of gyration further
decreases from 2.03 nm at 8 M to 1.44 nm at 12 M ethanol concentration
(Figure 7C). This suggests
that higher ethanol concentration favors the β-sheet formation.
Thus, we conclude that ethanol acts as protein-stabilizing osmolyte
and favors aggregation. These radii of gyration results are further
confirmed by our calculated distance of each peptide from center of
mass with time (Figure S2). We observed
that in water, all of the peptide distances converge with time since
β-sheet content increases with simulation time. At 3 and 8 M
urea concentrations, peptide distances from the center of mass increase
with time as the unfolding of peptides from helix to coil occurs,
while at 5 M urea concentration, only few peptide distances converge
with time as these peptides at this urea concentration transform to
β-sheet. In the presence of arginine as co-solvent, all of the
peptide distances from the center of mass increases with time as well
as concentration. This is because with increase in concentration of
arginine, all of the peptides adopt open conformations. Contrary to
urea and arginine, since ethanol shows maximum β-sheet aggregation
among these simulations, the distances from the center of mass of
each peptide converges with time at each concentration (Figure S2).

In summary, the number of hydrogen
bonds formed between all peptide
pairs; the radius of gyration; the β-sheet content obtained
from DSSP; the number of hydrogen bonds formed between protein and
protein, protein and water (PW), and protein and osmolyte (PO); and
PCA analysis are in excellent agreement. Each quantity explains the
nonmonotonic function of urea concentration, arginine as best aggregation
suppressor, and ethanol as best aggregation enhancer for this peptide.

Dynamics of Water Molecules in the Presence of Osmolytes
It is known that thin-layer water around protein plays a significant
role during the folding of protein. This thin layer forms a hydration
shell of a few nanometers around the proteins. Since protein contains
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, this hydration shell water
causes specific arrangement of these residues; therefore, hydrophobic
residues are buried inside the protein core and hydrophilic residues
are exposed to water on the surface.45,50 Hence, it
was of interest to investigate water dynamics and its role in peptide
aggregation in terms of radial distribution function (RDF) and tetrahedral
order parameter. The time correlation function for protein–water
(Cpw(t)) and protein–osmolyte
(Cpo(t)) hydrogen bonds
formed by the water molecules and osmolytes present in the first hydration
layer was also calculated.

We have calculated the radial distribution
function of water and osmolytes around protein during the simulation.
In pure water simulations, the radial distribution function (RDF)
of water plotted in Figure 8A approaches 1 around a radial distance of 2 nm. In urea (3,
5, and 8 M), arginine (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M), and ethanol (4, 8, and
12 M) simulations, the RDFs of water and osmolytes with respect to
protein are significantly different. We observed substitution of water
molecules with urea in the vicinity of the protein to be directly
proportional to the urea concentration. At 3 M urea concentration,
the water RDF value reaches to 1 at a radial distance of ∼2.3
nm, while in pure water, the RDF value reaches 1 at a radial distance
of 2 nm. As the concentration of urea is further increased, this gradual
substitution of water in the vicinity of protein results in approximately
similar radial distribution function to protein solvated in pure water
(Figure 8B). Also,
the distribution of urea around protein continuously increases with
increasing concentration and its RDF value reaches 1 only at radial
distances of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.35 nm at 3, 5, and 8 M urea concentrations,
respectively, which shows replacement of water molecule from protein
surface, and thus interaction of urea with protein increases, whereas
a nonmonotonic behavior is observed at 5 M urea concentration. An
increase in the interaction of urea with protein leads to extended
conformation of protein and thus inhibits β-sheet formation.
First, the hydration peak of water in the presence of urea and in
pure water is found to be almost similar, but the first hydration
peak of urea has greater altitude than water, which shows larger interaction
of urea with protein than water.

Figure 8 Radial distribution functions of oxygen
of water molecule and osmolytes
with respect to protein surface in (A) pure water, (B) urea [denoted
as u] 3, 5, and 8 M, (C) arginine [denoted as a] 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2
M, and (D) ethanol [denoted as e] 4, 8, and 12 M (water and osmolyte
plots are marked with arrows).

In the case of simulation of protein with arginine (0.4,
0.8, 1.2
M), radial distribution of water molecule around protein approaches
1 at a distance of 2.4 nm compared to the case of water, which reaches
1 at a distance of 2 nm (Figure 8C). RDF of arginine reaches 1 only at a radial distance
of 0.3 nm and also its RDF value increases with increase in concentration
(Figure 8C). Thus,
more water molecules are replaced by arginine from the surface of
protein compared to urea. The altitude of the first hydration peak
of arginine is much higher than that of water, which shows more interaction
of arginine molecule with protein compared to water. This indicates
that accumulation of arginine molecules around protein is relatively
higher compared to urea. The differential β-sheet perturbation
of protein in arginine and urea solvation as observed in PCA analysis
might be because of this unequal distribution of water in urea and
arginine solvation.

The RDF value of water in ethanol with respect
to protein at 4
and 8 M ethanol concentrations reaches 1 at a radial distance of ∼3
nm. The RDF value of water around protein at 12 M ethanol concentration
reaches 1 only at a radial distance of 0.68 nm compared to that of
water at 2 nm in the case of simulation of protein with water only
(Figure 8D). At 12
M ethanol concentration, distribution of water molecule around protein
is larger than that at 4 M ethanol concentration (Figure 8D). It should be noted that
as the concentration of ethanol molecule increases, the chance of
finding water molecule near ethanol molecule gets reduced compared
to finding water molecule near protein. As obvious from the RDF of
ethanol (Figure 8D),
there is no distinct first hydration peak present as in the case of
other osmolytes, which shows that no replacement of water molecule
is observed by ethanol molecule in the first hydration peak. For this
reason the interaction of water with protein in the presence of ethanol
is higher compared to other osmolytes. This suggests the possibility
that the ethanol molecules tend to form clusters (see Figure S3) and it was further confirmed using
g_clustsize of the gromacs utility. For these calculations, the cluster
was defined as all molecules of ethanol, which fall within 0.35 nm
distance from each other. Such ethanol cluster formation is also reported
in previous studies.51

The average
number of protein–water and protein–urea
hydrogen bonds was calculated, and because of the accumulation of
urea around the protein, the number of protein–water hydrogen
bonds decreases with increase in the concentration of urea (Figure 9A). The number of
protein–arginine hydrogen bonds increases with increase in
the concentration of arginine, but compared to urea, protein–arginine
hydrogen bond is much less in number (Figure 9B). Contrary to these, in the case of ethanol
solvation (4, 8, 12 M), the number of protein–water hydrogen
bonds first decreases up to 8 M ethanol concentration and then increases
at 12 M ethanol concentration (Figure 9C). This indicates that the hydrogen bonding pattern
of protein–water in the case of ethanol is concentration-dependent
and shows the signature of observed anomalous behavior.52 We did not observe ethanol–protein hydrogen
bond during ethanol solvation. Perhaps this is responsible for enhanced
β-sheet formation in this solvation as observed in the β-sheet
content obtained from DSSP and also with FEL plot. Figure 9C shows that no hydrogen bond
is formed between protein and ethanol, which also supports the formation
of cluster result. Thus, ethanol acts as a protein-stabilizing osmolyte.

Figure 9 Average
number of hydrogen bonds formed between protein and protein,
protein and water, and protein and osmolyte along with its standard
deviation in (A) urea (0, 3, 5, and 8 M), (B) arginine (0, 0.4, 0.8,
and 1.2 M), and (C) ethanol (0, 4, 8, and 12 M).

The presence of high concentration of urea and arginine strongly
affects intra- and intermolecular interactions. Increase in the concentration
of urea and arginine considerably affects the average number of hydrogen
bonds (Table 3), and
this change occurs uniformly, i.e., protein–water hydrogen
bond decreases with increase in the concentrations of urea and arginine,
protein–arginine hydrogen bond increases, and in the case of
ethanol, protein–water hydrogen bond decreases up to 8 M and
then increases at 12 M ethanol concentration, but no hydrogen bond
is observed between protein and ethanol (see Table 3 and Figure 9). Contribution of the average number of hydrogen bonds
formed between protein and water in different osmolytes is given in Table S3.

Furthermore, at each concentration
of urea and arginine, the number
of protein–urea and protein–arginine hydrogen bonds
increases with time but no protein–ethanol hydrogen bond is
formed in ethanol system during the simulation (Figure 9C), which shows cluster formation by ethanol.
Although protein–water hydrogen bond decreases with increase
in ethanol concentration, protein–protein hydrogen bond increases
with increase in concentration, whereas in other osmolytes, protein–protein
hydrogen bond decreases with increase in concentration (Figure 9). These results suggest that
the formation of more β-sheets occurs with increase in ethanol
concentration, which is in good agreement with the result obtained
from DSSP and FEL plot.

It is seen from the above result that
presence of osmolytes in
protein–water medium alters the regular protein–water
hydrogen bond due to the formation of protein–osmolyte hydrogen
bond at the surface.

To investigate the relaxation dynamics
of these hydrogen bonds
formed between protein and water (PW) and protein and osmolytes (PO)
present in the first hydration shell, hydrogen bond time correlation
function C(t)53,54 has been used. Two criteria can be used to define the hydrogen bond
geometric or energetics. Here, we have used geometric criteria to
define the hydrogen bond.55−57C(t) is defined as 2  where h(t) is the hydrogen bond population function,
whose value can be either
1 or 0. If a pair of hydrogen bond is formed at particular time, then h(t) = 1, otherwise it is 0. The angular
bracket indicates the averaged overall hydrogen bond. C(t) is independent of breaking and reformation of
hydrogen bond between times 1 and 0. The overall hydrogen bond relaxation
time can be extracted from the decay pattern of C(t). Hydrogen bond time correlation functions are
best fitted by stretched exponential function of time with stretching
exponents (n) in the range of 0.20–0.48, which
gives reasonable fit data (Figure 10 and Table 4).

A significant difference between the relaxation behavior of hydrogen
bond dynamics in different osmolytes at various concentrations is
observed. The hydrogen bond lifetime r′HB of water molecules present in the first hydration layer
of protein in pure water is 7.967 ps, and the r′HB values of water molecules at 3 and 8 M urea concentrations
are lower than those of pure water, but they increase at moderate
concentrations. The r′HB value
of PO at 3 M urea concentration is 44.15 ps, at 5 M urea concentration,
it decreases to 25.57 ps, and at 8 M urea concentration, it further
increases to 36.59 ps, which shows the nonmonotonic behavior of urea
at moderate concentration (Table 4).

In the case of arginine, r′HB of PW continuously decreases with increase
in the concentration
of arginine and r′HB of protein–arginine
increases with increase in the concentration of arginine (Table 4).

In the case
of ethanol, since no hydrogen bond is formed between
protein and ethanol, r′HB of protein–ethanol
is found to be 0 and r′HB of PW
in ethanol continuously increases with increase in ethanol concentration,
which is in agreement with hydrogen bond results.

To get further
insights into the above results, interaction energy
as a function of time between protein and protein and protein and
co-solvent has been calculated in each osmolyte at various concentrations
and is plotted in Figure S4. More negative
value of interaction energy shows greater interaction. Protein–protein
interaction in urea decreases with increase in the concentration of
urea, but a slight increase in interaction is observed at 5 M urea
(Figure S4). However, protein–urea
interaction continuously increases with increase in concentration
(Figure S4). In the case of arginine, protein–protein
interaction continuously decreases and protein–arginine interaction
continuously increases with increasing arginine concentration (Figure S4). In the case of ethanol, protein–protein
interaction increases with concentration, but protein–ethanol
interaction remains constant at each concentration of ethanol and
almost close to 0 (Figure S4), which supports
the result that no hydrogen bond formation occurs between protein
and ethanol. Data of interaction energy between protein and protein
and protein and co-solvent at various concentrations are provided
in Table S4.

The reason for the nonmonotonic
behavior of urea as reported earlier
is the selective accumulation of urea for different amino acids.58,59 Radial distribution functions of urea around residues VAL, ILE,
and ASN as representative amino acid of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
groups are plotted, and it is found that distribution of urea around
hydrophobic residues shows nonmonotonic distribution (Figure S5). The CVNITV peptide adopts extended
conformation at low urea concentration and thus leads to open hydrogen-binding
sites, which in turn promote β-sheet formation. At high urea
concentration, accumulation of urea around peptide increases to the
extent of saturating the hydrogen-binding sites and thus hinders peptide
aggregation. At moderate concentration of urea, enough of hydrogen-binding
sites are free, which results in β-sheet formation.

Further
insights into the effect of osmolytes on protein aggregation
can be examined by calculating the nonbonded interactions. From the
previous results, we found that the interaction of osmolytes with
protein continuously increases with increasing concentration, except
in the case of ethanol and at moderate urea concentration, i.e., at
5 M, which prompts an examination of the direct interaction of osmolytes
with the protein. For this, we calculate the nonbonded interaction
energy “E” of protein with protein
(EPP) and protein with its local solvent
environment, i.e., with urea (EPU), arginine
(EPA), ethanol (EPE), and water (EPW). The calculation
scheme for interaction energy is described by eqs 3–5. The negative
value of interaction energy E shows favorable driving
force toward unfolding. 3   4   5  where EPP is the
interaction energy of protein–protein, EPO is the interaction energy of protein–osmolyte, and EPW is the interaction energy of protein–water.
LJ and CB indicate Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions to the overall
interaction energy, respectively. Table 5 shows the result for the interaction energy
of protein with protein, protein with osmolytes, and protein with
water. Total noncovalent interaction of the system is also calculated
(Table 5). We find
that with increase in the concentration of urea, interaction of urea
with unfolded conformation of protein continuously increases, as indicated
by the negative value of EPU, but a slight
increase in the value of EPU is observed
at 5 M urea concentration, which indicates the formation of β-sheet.
In the case of arginine also, interaction of arginine with protein
continuously increases with increase in concentration, as indicated
by the negative value of EPA. The more
negative value of EPA shows suppression
of protein aggregation due to increase in protein–arginine
interaction and decrease in protein–protein interaction, as
shown by the more positive value of EPP in the presence of arginine. In the case of ethanol, protein–ethanol
interaction continuously decreases and protein–protein interaction
continuously increases with increase in the concentration of ethanol,
as shown by increasing value of EPE and
decreasing value of EPP (Table 5). This indicates that ethanol
favors protein aggregation and urea and arginine suppress protein
aggregation. These results are in good agreement with results obtained
from the calculation of the number of hydrogen bonds between protein
and protein, protein and osmolyte, and protein and water (Figure 9). Total noncovalent
interaction between protein and protein in different osmolytes as
a function of simulation time is plotted (Figure S6). Total noncovalent interaction of the system versus osmolytes
concentration is also plotted (Figure 11), which shows a variation similar to that
shown by hydrogen bonds in each osmolyte.

(Coulomb and Lennard-Jones) of the
system in different osmolytes at various concentrations.

Tetrahedral Order Parameter
Owing
to its greater significance,
orientational tetrahedral order parameters (q) are
more widely investigated compared to other order parameters. It was
first given by Chau and Hardwick and further modified by Errington
and Debenedetti.60 Basically, qtet is used to define the local structure of water molecule.
This refers to a central water molecule surrounded by four water molecules
in the first shell, and it can be calculated as 6  where ψj,k is the angle formed by the central oxygen
atom with rij and rjk bond vectors of its four
nearest neighbor
atoms j and k. The value of qtet is 1 for a perfect tetrahedral arrangement
and 0 for random arrangement. Average tetrahedral order parameter
has been calculated considering only water molecules as nearest neighbors
as a function of osmolytes concentration to see the effect of osmolytes.
The calculation of tetrahedral order parameters is done by taking
mean over all molecules and also over all ensembles using following
equation 7  where N is the total number
of molecules.

Tetrahedral order parameters are frequently used
in analyzing the water structure, and can be calculated from the angles
made by any two of the nearest water molecules to the central water
molecule. To investigate the effect of osmolytes on water structure,
the average tetrahedral order parameter of the bulk water has been
calculated using eqs 6 and 7 as a function of osmolyte concentration. Figure 12 shows the variation
of qtet as a function of osmolyte concentration
in different osmolytes.

Figure 12 Average tetrahedral order parameter of bulk
water molecule as a
function of osmolyte concentration.

Assuming the water structure to be tetrahedral, the tetrahedral
order parameter provides a good measure of angular arrangements of
the nearest neighbors around a central molecule. Any deviation of
the tetrahedral order parameter of water in the presence of osmolytes
indicates angular distortion in water structure. In such calculation,
it is very important to choose nearest neighbors properly. Since in
pure water, all of the neighbors are water molecules around central
water, but in the binary mixture of osmolyte and water, first four
neighbors can be water or osmolyte molecules. In this analysis, we
calculated the tetrahedral order parameter by considering the water
molecules as four nearest neighbors only (neglecting urea as a neighbor),
as a function of osmolyte concentration. From Figure 12A, it has been found that in urea, the value
of qtet decreases as the concentration
of urea increases. A similar trend was observed in the case of arginine
and ethanol, as shown in Figure 12B,C, with increase in the concentration of osmolyte.
A higher value of qtet is found in the
simulation of protein with pure water, and it is 0.588, which continuously
decreases with addition of osmolytes with increasing concentration.
The average tetrahedral order parameter of pure water is also calculated
to be 0.597, which is in good agreement with the value obtained in
the simulation of aggregation-causing peptides in pure water (i.e.,
0.588), which indicates that water molecules are more ordered around
aggregation-causing peptides and its tetrahedral order gets disturbed
with the addition of osmolytes. The distribution of tetrahedral order
parameter has also been plotted. The distribution (P(q)) of the tetrahedral order parameter, q, shows the marked variation with increase in the concentration
of osmolyte (see Figure S7).61 The distribution P(q) for pure water (blue line) has a peak at a q value of 0.588. With increase in the concentration of osmolytes,
tetrahedral peaks in the distribution continuously decrease. A similar
trend was also observed by Idrissi et al.,62 who concluded that this change is due to breaking in the tetrahedral
structure of water molecule by osmolytes. On comparing the effects
of urea, arginine, and ethanol on qtet of water, we observe that the tetrahedral structure of water molecule
is more perturbed in the presence of urea (Figure 12A). Since in the presence of ethanol, more
β-sheets are formed, qtet must approach
the value of pure water, but because of the formation of cluster by
ethanol with increase in concentration, distortion in water structure
occurs, and thus the qtet value decreases,
but this decrease is smaller than that in the case of urea.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have reported the atomistic simulation study
of the aggregation process of eight CVNITV hexapeptides in aqueous
urea, aqueous arginine, and aqueous ethanol solution. To explore the
effect of osmolytes, we have used urea, arginine, and ethanol, each
with three different concentrations. The number of hydrogen bonds
formed between all peptide pairs, radius of gyration, and β-sheet
contents are calculated from MD simulation to describe the aggregation
behavior.

Increase in the number of urea molecule in solution
can suppress
the peptide aggregation at 3 and 8 M urea concentrations, while a
weak enhancement in secondary structure is observed at 5 M urea concentration.
Increase in the number of arginine can suppress the protein aggregation
evenly at all concentrations, which can be seen in the analysis of
the number of hydrogen bonds, β-sheet content, and radius of
gyration. Ethanol is found to be a protein-stabilizing osmolyte in
our case and favors β-sheet formation with increase in concentration.

The competition among hydrogen bonds formed between all peptide
pairs determines the aggregation process as well as the final structure
of oligomer with time. The number of hydrogen bonds formed between
protein and water, protein and urea, and protein and protein indicate
that urea molecule removes the water molecule from the first solvation
shell and gets accumulated around the protein, which leads to the
increase in the number of hydrogen bonds between urea and protein
with increase in concentration and thus hinders protein aggregation.
However, the competition between protein–urea and protein–protein
hydrogen bonds leads to a nonmonotonic behavior of CVNITV peptides
at moderate urea concentration.

A similar behavior is shown
by arginine on the number of hydrogen
bonds at all concentrations, which depict the aggregation-suppressing
nature of arginine by decreasing the interaction between protein and
protein. Ethanol shows an opposite effect, i.e., it enhances the peptide
aggregation by favoring the β-sheet formation, and also interaction
between peptides increases with increase in the number of hydrogen
bonds between peptides.

PCA is in good agreement with the above
results, which depicts
the aggregation inhibition behavior of urea and arginine and the protein-stabilizing
effect of ethanol.

These results could be helpful in understanding
the mechanistic
details of aggregation of this peptide. Since prion protein aggregation
is responsible for several diseases, investigating these aggregation
processes is relevant for both control of the disease and developing
therapeutics’ of disease. A complementary extension of the
present study could be examining other aggregation-prone peptides
of this protein as well as full protein in the presence of different
osmolytes and water.

Methods
Identification of aggregation-prone
fragment of sheep prion protein
has been done using three different aggregation prediction servers,
i.e., PASTA, TANGO, and AGGRESCAN, and the results were further validated
by using protein database tool Zipper DB designed for prediction of
aggregation-prone hexapeptides.

MD Simulation Details
MD simulations
of the octamer
of identified fragment (179CVNITV184) of sheep
prion protein in the presence of single point charge water model and
different osmolytes like urea (3, 5, and 8 M concentrations), l-arginine (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M concentrations), and ethanol
(4, 8, and 12 M concentrations) were performed at 300 K. The force
field GROMOS96 53a6 was used during simulations. All simulations were
performed using single-precision Gromacs-4.5.4 software.44,63 The PDB file for prion protein from RCSB Protein Data Bank was used
for MD simulations. A cubical box (size, 6 × 6 × 6 nm3) of osmolytes with each concentration was built and equilibrated
using the method of Rocco et al.64 GROMOS96
53a6 force field has been used for each osmolyte during box generation.
The topology file for urea and ethanol has been generated by Automated
Topology Builder65 using GROMOS_53A6 force
field. Initially, the eight fragments of CVNITV were inserted in the
simulation box at a distance of 1 nm from each other using the genconf
command of gromacs utility.44 All of the
peptides are allowed to diffuse toward each other under the influence
of GROMOS96 53a6 force field. An isotropic force of 1000 kJ/mol nm2 was used at all atoms during the steepest descent energy
minimization. Thereafter, a two-step simulation was performed, with
100 ps of position-restrained MD using LINCS algorithm, followed by
100 ns of full-standard MD. All of the simulations were performed
at 1 bar with a coupling constant of 0.5 ps for pressure and 0.1 ps
for temperature, applying the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm in
both cases.66 The time step for integration
algorithm was set at two femtoseconds to integrate Newton’s
equation of motion using a leap frog algorithm. PME electrostatics67,68 was applied using a Lennard-Jones cutoff of 1.4 nm and a Coulomb
cutoff of 0.9 nm with maximum spacing of 0.12 nm for the fast Fourier
transform grid to reduce the computational complexity of molecular
dynamic simulations. To palliate the system size effects, periodic
boundary conditions were applied. All analyses were done ignoring
the initial 10 ns trajectory of the simulation for equilibration and
using gromacs utilities.
