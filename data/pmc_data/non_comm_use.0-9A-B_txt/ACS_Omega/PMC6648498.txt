β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)
forms a host–guest inclusion
complex with many organic and amphiphilic compounds found in pharmaceutical,
textile, cosmetic, food, and personal care systems. Therefore, grafting
of β-CD onto a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) offers a possible
strategy to use functionalized CNC to complex with surface-active
molecules. We have successfully grafted β-CD onto CNCs in a
stepwise manner using cyanuric chloride as the linker. The structure
of β-CD-grafted CNC (CNC-CD) was characterized by UV–vis
and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and the grafting ratio
of β-CD was determined by the phenolphthalein inclusion protocol.
Ionic surfactants induced the aggregation of CNC-CDs by forming inclusion
complexes with β-CDs on the surface of CNC. The interactions
of amphiphilic compounds with CNC-CD were examined by surface tensiometry,
conductometric and potentiometric titration, and isothermal titration
calorimetry. Mechanisms describing the complex formation between surfactants
and CNC-CD were proposed, where an improved understanding of CD interactions
with surfactants and lipids would enable better strategies for drug
encapsulation and delivery with CDs.

1 Introduction
Surface-active
agents, also known as surfactants, are amphiphilic
compounds consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments that
self-assemble in water to form aggregates (micelles) beyond the critical
micelle concentration (cmc). Beyond the cmc, the morphological transitions
of micelles produce different morphologies, such as spheres, cylinders,
vesicles, bilayers, and hexagonal phases.1−3 These micellar
structures are governed by the balance between the hydrophobic and
headgroup interactions in aqueous solvents.1 The micellar and thermodynamic properties of surfactants are mainly
dependent on pH, pressure, temperature, concentration, and added electrolytes,
cosurfactants, and cosolvents.1 The specific
properties, function, and application of surfactants depend on the
cmc values and other parameters (the dissociation degree, aggregation
number) of micellar aggregates.1 Because
of their specific properties, surfactants and their micellar systems
are widely used in food formulations, detergency, drug delivery, emulsion
stabilization, textiles, personal care, cosmetic products, paper and
paint production, synthesis of nanomaterials, mining (flotation),
as well as to generate confined and controlled reaction platforms
in aqueous solutions, catalysis of organic reactions, and as mobile
phases in chromatographic techniques to separate ionic and nonionic
species.1,3

Poor aqueous solubility and rate of
dissolution represent major
challenges and constitute two critical factors in the formulation
and delivery of drug molecules.4 The concept
of utilizing nanostructured materials with cyclodextrin (CD) for drug
encapsulation has emerged as a feasible approach to improve the encapsulation
and delivery of active compounds in biomedical sciences. β-Cyclodextrin
(β-CD) forms a host–guest inclusion complex,5,6 mainly driven by hydrophobic or van der Waals and hydrogen bond
interactions,4,7 with many organic and amphiphilic
compounds, like surfactants found in pharmaceutical, textile, cosmetic,
food, and personal care systems.6 CDs are
known to bind surfactant molecules below the surfactant cmc; however,
interactions of CDs with surfactant micelles (above the cmc) are not
well understood.

Cellulose is one of the most ubiquitous and
abundant renewable
biopolymers obtained from different sources.8 It is a long-chain, high-molecular-weight polysaccharide (a homopolymer)
composed of repeat units of dimers or disaccharides of anhydro-d-glucopyranose unit (AGU), known as cellobiose, where each
AGU unit is connected by a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage.9,10 The unique rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is extracted from
cellulose microfibrils by concentrated sulfuric acid-mediated hydrolysis
yielding CNCs with a typical dimension ranging from 2 to 50 nm in
width and 100–2000 nm in length, possessing abundant anionic
sulfate ester groups onto the CNC surfaces.8,9 Such
CNCs can yield electrostatically stable colloidal dispersions,8 and they have received an unprecedented attention
in materials science because of their unique physicochemical properties.9 The unique features of CNCs enhance their attractiveness
in the development of novel functional nanomaterials and their applications,11,12 such as additives in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, food
application13 (Pickering emulsions,14 ice cream15), high-performance
inorganic materials, and biomedicine (fat reduction16).

CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of 6–8
α-d-glucopyranose units, linked by α-1,4-glucosidic
linkages
that form a ring and have the shape of truncated cone or torus.5,6 They are crystalline, homogeneous, water-soluble, biocompatible,
nonhygroscopic, and stable (chemically and physically) macromolecules
produced by enzymatic degradation of starch.4 Because of the presence of the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups
on the exterior of the cyclic structure, the exterior of a CD is hydrophilic,
which allows hydrogen bonding cohesive interactions, whereas the central
cavity presents a hydrophobic environment as a host that promotes
the binding interaction with hydrocarbon segments of guests (surfactants,
lipids, polymers, ionic liquids, alkanes, amino acids, and vitamins)
to form inclusion complexes.5,7 Thus, nonpolar molecules
or compounds are capable of displacing bound water molecules in the
cavity of CD to form inclusion complexes.17 β-CD is ideal for complexation because of its ideal cavity
size, efficient drug encapsulation and loading, availability, and
relatively low cost.4 Because of its unique
property in forming host–guest inclusion complexes18−21 with a variety of nonpolar molecules, β-CD has been extensively
studied and applied in medical, pharmaceutical, and health and personal
care products to enhance their water solubility, stability, bioavailability,
and biocompatibility of active reagents or to eliminate undesirable
component from solutions.22−24

The design of a number
of industrial formulations relies on the
solution behavior of surfactants, which can be affected by the presence
of various solutes. In particular, supramolecules, such as CDs, may
alter the surfactant micellization in water because of host–guest
interaction with the hydrophobe on the surfactant molecule.6 Understanding the nature and characteristics
of surfactant–polymer and surfactant–nanoparticle interactions
is necessary to enhance the performance of many products.25,26 In the presence of polymers, surfactants tend to aggregate on the
polymer chains because of electrostatic or hydrophobic attractions
at the critical aggregation concentration. In order to incorporate
CNC into surfactant solutions, it is vital to understand the behavior
of CNC in the presence of surfactants because of its charged characteristics.
Interactions between CNC and anionic surfactants have been studied
to improve the dispersibility and stability of CNC in nonpolar solvents27 and poly (lactic acid).28 Grafting of β-CD enables the fixation of active reagent carriers
on the surface of CNC, which imparts new properties and enriches its
potential applications. Surfactants, being amphiphilic molecules, can
form complexes with β-CD by the inclusion of a hydrophobic segment
into the nonpolar cavity. Because the surface activity and micellization
behavior are significantly influenced by β-CD, a comprehensive
understanding on the behavior of β-CD-grafted CNC in the presence
of ionic and nonionic surfactants will facilitate the use of such
nanomaterials in pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The grafting
of β-CD onto magnetic-CNC was demonstrated recently by our group,
and the system was used to remove organic molecules, where the host–guest
inclusion of two model hydrophobic drug molecules was demonstrated.27 In this paper, we report on the synthesis of
β-CD-grafted CNC (CNC-CD) using cyanuric chloride as the linker.
The reaction conditions to enhance the grafting of β-CD were
examined, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV were used to
confirm the grafting. Studies on the interactions between surfactant
molecules and CNC were previously reported; however, there were no
studies describing the interactions between surfactants and CNC-CD.
Our hypothesis is that the host–guest interaction between β-CD
and various types of surfactants will impact the physical interactions
with CNC-CD, and understanding of the impact of functional groups
on the behavior of surfactants with modified CNC is necessary. Hence, the
interactions between CNC-CD and three surfactants were investigated
by microcalorimetry, surface tensiometry, conductivity, and zeta potential
measurements, and the physical mechanisms describing these interactions
are proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis and FTIR
CNC-CDs synthesized
in water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were characterized by UV–vis
(Figure 1) and
FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 2). Monochlorotriazine (MCT)-β-CD possessed a specific
absorbance at 245 nm, and upon the substitution of the third chlorine
atom, the change in the electron distribution on the triazine ring
induced a blue shift from 245 to 230 nm. Pristine CNC did not display
any specific UV absorbance, and the observed absorbance without any
peaks was attributed to scattering from the CNC nanorods.

Figure 1 UV–vis
spectra of MCT-β-CD, CNC, and CNC-CD.

The FTIR spectra of cyanuric chloride and MCT-β-CD
are compared
in Figure 2, where
the peaks centered at 1579 and 1467 cm–1 are attributed
to the triazine ring on the cyanuric chloride. The peaks between 1487
and 868 cm–1 are the characteristic bands for β-CD
molecules. In addition, the new peak at 819 cm–1 is attributed to C–Cl bond that has red-shifted from 920
nm–1 because of the substitution of chlorine atoms.29

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of CNC, CNC-CD, and MCT-β-CD synthesized
in
water.

The spectra of CNC-β-CD
(water) and CNC-β-CD (DMSO)
both possessed new peaks at 1722 and 1770 cm–1,
which are attributed to C=O stretching from the rearrangement
of triazine rings as shown in Scheme S1.30

2.2 Grafting
Ratio of MCT-β-CD
Phenolphthalein (PHTH) molecules
deprotonate and form a 1:1 host–guest
inclusion complex with β-CD above a pH of 8.2. Free PHTHs in
the bulk phase possess a UV absorption peak at 552 nm, whereas those
forming an inclusion complex with β-CD no longer absorb at this
wavelength. With the increasing β-CD concentration, the pink
color of PHTH solutions gradually faded and the absorbance of PHTH
solutions decreased proportionally, which yields a linear relationship
between ln(Abs of PHTH) and ln(β-CD concentration) (Figures S1 and S2). Because pristine CNC is negatively
charged due to the sulfate groups on its surface (reported sulfur
content, S = 0.86%),31,32 PHTH did not interact electrostatically
with pristine CNC. The amounts of PHTH molecules included in the cavity
of β-CD could be used to determine the weight percentage of
β-CD in CNC-CD.

The grafting ratio of β-CD on CNC
depends on the reaction conditions and the solvent environment (Figure S3). For the reaction in water and DMSO,
the average grafting ratios of β-CD were 3.32 and 4.92 wt %,
respectively. The observed difference is related to the hydrolysis
of chlorine atoms on MCT-β-CD, which reduced the reactivity
with the hydroxyl groups on CNC. By reducing the water content in
the reaction, the β-CD grafting ratio was enhanced, but it was
still lower than when using DMSO as the solvent, indicating that water
content is critical in the reactions with cyanuric chloride.

In addition to the impact of water, the hydrolysis of chlorine
atoms on MCT-β-CD was affected by the concentration of sodium
bicarbonate, reaction temperature, and time. Sodium bicarbonate was
used to scavenge hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecules generated from
−Cl substitution and the hydrolysis of −Cl from the
added base. The grafting ratio was enhanced by increasing the reaction
temperature and reducing the heating time with an upper limit of 140
°C, beyond which β-CD started to degrade and CNC began
to discolor and become yellowish.

The reaction conditions for
the use of cyanuric chloride as a linker
to graft β-CD on CNC were optimized. In comparison to a previous
study,33 where CNC was labeled with 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein
(5-DTAF), our grafting ratio was approximately 103 times
(29.7 μmol/g) better than 5-DTAF (24 ± 1 nmol/g) despite
the molecular weight of β-CD being much larger than that of
5-DTAF.

2.3 Interactions with a Nonionic Surfactant
Surface tension and enthalpy changes of a nonionic surfactant,
4-octylphenol polyethoxylate (TX-100) in water, CD, CNC suspension,
and CNC-CD suspension were measured as a function of TX-100 concentration
(Figure 3A). TX-100
possessed a cmc of 0.28 mM in water as determined from the inflexion
point of surface tension and the first-order differential curve of
the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) thermogram (Figure S4). The surface tension of TX-100 in
a CNC suspension did not change much up to the inflexion point at
0.09 mM, where it started to decrease. This is attributed to the hydrophilic
tail of TX-100 that possibly hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl groups
on the surface of CNC, whereas the hydrophobic domains remained surface-active
and partitioned to the air–water interface (Scheme 1-top left panel). Because CNC
is much larger than TX-100 molecules, the interface became saturated
more rapidly at a lower TX-100 concentration. The calculated surface
area coverage was larger compared with TX-100 alone (given by the
slope of surface tension vs ln(c) in Figure 3A), signifying that the TX-100/CNC
aggregates occupied a larger surface area at the air–water
interface. However, the behavior of TX-100 in the CNC-CD suspension
was different; the surface tension in CNC-CD decreased slower than
in water, indicating a reduced surface activity of TX-100 at the same
concentration. This can be explained by the hydrophobic segment of
TX-100 forming a host–guest inclusion complex with β-CD,
resulting in a loss in its surface activity by the detachment from
the interface and partitioning to the bulk solution (Scheme 1-top right panel). The identical
cmc observed for TX-100 in water and CNC-CD is possibly due to a higher
affinity of TX-100 monomers for the air–water interface than
to β-CD.

and (B) thermograms from titrating TX-100 into water, 0.18 mM β-CD,
0.6 wt % CNC, and 0.6 wt % CNC-CD suspensions at 25 °C.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagrams Describing the
Changes in the Behavior of CNC-CD
Compared to CNC in Different Charged Surfactants
The concentration shown in the
scheme is below the cmc for TX-100 and above the cmc for SDS and CTAB.

From the calorimetric curves of TX-100 (Figure 3B), the difference
between titrations into
water and into CNC suspension was negligible. However, the ITC thermograms
of the TX-100/CNC-CD system revealed a large exothermic enthalpy change
at very low TX-100 concentration, which was also observed in the TX-100/CD
system. This confirmed the host–guest interaction between TX-100
and β-CD as postulated earlier from the surface tension data.
The shift of the cmc to a higher value for both CNC-CD and β-CD
was attributed to the inclusion complexation of TX-100 monomers and
β-CD, thus more monomers were required to produce the micelles.

2.4 Interactions with an Anionic Surfactant
In the surface tension measurements (Figure 4A), the slopes [dγ/dln(c)] (designated as slope 1) prior to the cmc for the addition
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) into water, CNC suspension, and CNC-CD
suspension were identical, and only slope 2 for CNC-CD (after the
cmc) was different. The valley in the surface tension curve is due
to trace contaminants arising from SDS synthesis or from the hydrolytic
reaction, which were frequently observed in studies on the surface
activity of SDS. In the presence of the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD
in the bulk phase, the removal of contaminants from the air–water
interface was facilitated by the inclusion complexation phenomenon,
resulting in a more rapid recovery of the surface tension for the
CNC-CD system.

Figure 4 (A) Surface tension curves of water, 0.6 wt % CNC, and
0.6 wt %
CNC-CD suspensions with increasing SDS concentrations at 25 °C.
(B) Thermograms from titrating SDS into water, 0.18 mM β-CD,
0.6 wt % CNC, and 0.6 wt % CNC-CD suspensions at 25 °C. The inset
is an enlargement of the region at low SDS concentration.

In the ITC thermogram for the SDS titration into
CNC-CD, an exothermic
interaction at low concentration was observed, which was similar to
the titration into β-CD, confirming the inclusion activity of
β-CD toward SDS monomers after it had been grafted on the CNC
surface. In the concentration range of 7.4–10.8 mM, an obvious
deviation in enthalpy change for the SDS/CNC-CD system was observed
(Figure 4B). This exothermic
interaction can likely be attributed to the inclusion complex-induced
aggregation of SDS.

To gain a clearer understanding of this
interaction, transmittance
and zeta potential were measured and compared with the ITC results
(Figure 5). The zeta
potential of CNC-CD was less negative than that of pristine CNC because
of the partial hydrolysis of sulfate groups during the grafting reaction.
With increasing SDS concentration, CNC displayed a gradual increase
in the zeta potential, whereas CNC-CD showed an initial reduction
up to region II and then a slight increase at 10.8 mM. The formation
of a host–guest complex between SDS and CNC-CD could be responsible
for the drop in the zeta potential because of the increased negative
charge on CNC-CD. From transmittance measurements, SDS/CNC showed
no obvious changes after the cmc, whereas CNC-CD became slightly cloudy
in region II, indicating the appearance of larger sized particles
because of the agglomeration of SDS-bound CNC-CD induced by hydrophobic
interactions between free and partially bound C12 alkyl
chains (Scheme 1-middle
right panel). In the photos taken under natural light, light scattering
particles were evident in the SDS/CNC-CD samples of region II and
disappeared at higher SDS concentration. The SDS/CNC samples remained
translucent over the entire region (Figure S5). Conductivity measurements for the addition of SDS to CNC-CD also
showed three regions (Figure S6). In region
II, a lower conductivity observed in the SDS/CNC-CD suspension suggested
a reduced mobility of SDS monomers in the bulk because of the encapsulation
of SDS monomers on β-CD grafted on CNC.

Figure 5 Comparison of ITC, transmittance,
and zeta potential results for
CNC/SDS (A) and CNC-CD/SDS (B) samples.

TEM images of SDS/CNC and SDS/CNC-CD revealed the aggregation
of
SDS induced by the inclusion complex on the surface of CNC-CD (Figure 6). The CNC and CNC-CD
concentrations were kept low to avoid the agglomeration of CNC-CD
observed in region II. From the images, both CNC and CNC-CD were well
dispersed, whereas the aggregation of SDS was only observed on the
nanorods of CNC-CD. In summary, at the SDS concentration in region
II, CNC did not interact with SDS monomers or micelles. With CNC-CD,
aggregates, induced by the formation of SDS/β-CD host–guest
complexes on the surface of CNC, were formed at an SDS concentration
of ∼7.6 mM and dissociated at ∼10.8 mM. In the SDS/β-CD
host–guest complexes, because of the length of the C12 alkyl
chains and the length of the CD cavity, part of the hydrophobic chains
was exposed. When the SDS concentration was increased, the monomers
nucleated around the inclusion complex driven by hydrophobic forces;
this is a different mechanism than the polymer-induced aggregation
of the surfactant. Considering the size of the aggregates, it is highly
likely that the aggregation of free or included SDS monomers could
bridge with other SDS/CNC-CD complexes to form larger aggregates,
which were then visible to the naked eyes. Beyond the cmc (∼11
mM), the SDS aggregates on the CNC-CD complexes continued to grow,
leading to the dissociation of large SDS/CNC-CD aggregates to form
smaller stable SDS/CNC-CD nanorods in water.

microscopy (TEM) images of 0.02 wt % of CNC
(A,B) and CNC-CD (C,D) with 8.5 mM SDS.

2.5 Interactions with a Cationic Surfactant
The cmc of hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) in water
is ∼1 mM as evident from the inflection point in the surface
tension (Figure 7A)
and the first-order differential curve of the ITC data. With CNC and
CNC-CD suspensions, changes in the surface tension followed a similar
trend, but they were different from the CTAB/water curve. The surface
tension profile could be divided into three regions with different
slopes. In the region with slope 1, positively charged groups on the
CTAB monomers were bound to the negatively charged CNC surface and
remained in the bulk solution.35 Only a
small fraction of the CTAB monomers were partitioned to the air–water
interface as confirmed by the slower reduction in the surface tension.
Because the hydrophobic tails of CTAB monomers bound to the CNC were
exposed to the bulk water, with an increasing number of bound monomers,
CNC particles became more hydrophobic and aggregated (Scheme 1-bottom left panel).35 At the first inflection point on the curve,
CNCs were driven to the interface by hydrophobic forces, resulting
in a rapid drop in surface tension with slope 2. The surface tension
of CNC-CD was lower than that of CNC but decreased at the same rate
as in slope 1. This could be explained by the reduced negative charge
of CNC-CD, where more CTAB monomers were driven to the air–water
interface. The host–guest interactions between CTAB hydrophobic
tails and grafted β-CD promoted the bridging of CNC-CDs to form
large hydrophobic aggregates that rise to the air–water interface,
which reduced the surface tension as shown in the region with slope
2 (Scheme 1-bottom
right panel).

Figure 7 (A) Surface tension curves of water, 0.1 wt % CNC, and
0.1 wt %
CNC-CD suspensions with increasing CTAB concentrations at 28 °C
and (B) thermograms of titrating SDS to water, 0.03 mM β-CD,
0.1 wt % CNC, and 0.1 wt % CNC-CD suspensions at 28 °C.

The host–guest interaction
between CTAB and β-CD was
described by a smaller ΔH at low concentration
as seen in the ITC thermogram (Figure 7B). A similar reduction was also observed when CNC-CD
was compared to CNC in the region where the electrostatic and host–guest
interactions both contributed to the ΔH. At ∼0.2 mM in
CNC-CD and ∼0.3 mM in CNC, the slight increase in the ΔH
is attributed to the aggregation of CNC or CNC-CD particles in the
bulk that correspond to the reduced slope in the conductivity (Figure S7). Because of the bridging effect of
the CTAB/β-CD complex, aggregation of CNC-CDs occurs at a lower
concentration.

Comparison of the calorimetric, phase separation,
and zeta potential
results provided a comprehensive understanding on the aggregation
behavior of CNC and CNC-CD in the presence of CTAB (Figure 8). In region I, the zeta potential
increased slowly when bound CTAB monomers adsorbed the CNC and CNC-CD
nanoparticles that produced small amounts of precipitates. At the
onset of region II, CNC-CDs were bridged by CTAB, inducing a rapid
aggregation and a faster precipitation, resulting in a less negative
zeta potential. The second reduction in the column height of the precipitates
at 0.25 mM CTAB corresponded to denser aggregates that settled into
a more compressed structure because of the further increase in the
zeta potential to ∼0 mV. At the end of region II, the microstructure
of the aggregates became less compact because of the continuous binding
of CTAB molecules that dissociated the aggregates into smaller, relatively
better-dispersed aggregates, yielding an increase in the height of
the aggregates in region III. However, it was not possible for CTAB
to entirely disperse CNC or CNC-CD nanoparticles to form transparent
suspensions even at concentration above the cmc. The difference in
CTAB-induced precipitation of CNC and CNC-CD can be observed in Figure S8.

potential results for CNC/CTAB

3 Conclusions
β-CDs were successfully
grafted to CNC, where the grafting
ratio of β-CD was determined by the PHTH inclusion method. The
interactions between CNC-CD nanoparticles and TX-100, SDS, and CTAB
were investigated by surface tensiometry, ITC, conductometry, transmittance,
phase separation, and zeta potential measurements. The primary interactions
in the CNC-CD/TX-100 and CNC-CD/SDS systems are host–guest
interactions between the hydrophobic domain of surfactants and β-CD.
Inclusion complex-induced aggregation was also observed in CNC-CD/SDS,
probably due to the incomplete inclusion of the SDS alkyl chain. Both
host–guest and electrostatic interactions between positively
charged CTAB and negatively charged CNC-CD contributed to the formation
of precipitates and the transition from loose to compact aggregates.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Spray-dried
CNCs were supplied
by CelluForce Inc. CNC suspensions were prepared by vigorous mixing
using a 500 W IKA T-25 homogenizer, followed by sonication in a 700
W 42 kHz Branson sonication bath. Cyanuric chloride, β-CD hydrate
(99%), PHTH, TX-100, SDS (>99%), and CTAB (>99%) were purchased
from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Deionized Millipore water was
used for all the sample preparations.

4.2 Synthesis
The synthesis of MCT-β-CD
was conducted according to the procedure reported by Liu et al.34 A clear solution of dichlorotriazine sodium
salt was obtained by dispersing cyanuric chloride in a NaOH solution
in an ice bath for 1 h. β-CD solution at pH 12 was then added
to allow the reaction between the primary hydroxyl groups on CNC and
dichlorotriazine at a temperature of 10 °C until the pH became
neutral (Schemes 2 and S1). MCT-β-CD was purified using acetone
and DMF with repetitive precipitation. Finally, the product was filtered
and dried in a vacuum oven until a constant weight was achieved.

Scheme 2 Procedure for MCT-β-CD Synthesis
The optimum reaction conditions for the synthesis of β-CD-grafted
CNCs (CNC-CD) were determined. CNC concentration, sodium bicarbonate
content, heating temperature, and time were all found to have an influence
on the β-CD grafting ratio. In the optimized procedure, a 2
wt % suspension of CNC was first activated in 0.02 w/w NaCO3 solution for 3 h, followed by the addition of various amounts of
MCT-β-CD at room temperature. The water content in the mixture
was then reduced to around 10 wt % on a Heidolph Laborota 4011 rotating
evaporator at 45 °C. The grafting reaction was conducted by heating
the concentrated mixture at 130 °C for 5 min. Unreacted MCT-β-CD
molecules were removed by dialysis against water over 2 weeks. CNC-CD
in DMSO was also synthesized, and the procedure is described in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Spectroscopy
Ultraviolet absorbance
of cyanuric chloride, CNC, and CNC-CD was measured on a Varian (Carey
100 Bio) UV–visible spectrometer at room temperature. Transmittance
was also measured on the same instrument at 600 nm. FTIR spectra of
samples in compressed KBr powder were obtained on a Bio-Rad (Excalibur
series) FTIR spectrometer over scanning wavelengths of 400–4000
cm–1.

4.4 Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM images were taken on a Philip CM10 electron microscopy to visualize
the inclusion complex-induced SDS aggregates on the surface of CNC-CD.
The TEM samples were prepared by depositing one drop of 0.02 wt %
suspension onto a carbon-coated copper grid. Samples with surfactants
were prepared by placing copper grids on a filter paper and excess
liquid was removed by the filter paper, and the dried nanoparticles
were retained for analysis.

4.5 Grafting Ratio
The grafting ratio
of β-CD was measured by the PHTH inclusion method. Freshly prepared
solution of 0.1 mM PHTH in 0.02 M NaCO3 buffer was used
for all the measurements. CNC-CD suspensions were mixed with PHTH,
stirred, and equilibrated overnight before measuring the absorbance
of the solutions. Samples without PHTH were also prepared as blank
controls. The amount of β-CD was determined by a calibration
of log(absorbance of PHTH/β-CD mixture) against log(concentration
of β-CD). The grafting ratio was then determined from eq 1 1  

4.6 Surface
Tensiometry
Surface tension
measurements were conducted on a DCAT 11 (DataPhysics) tensiometer.
Continuous dosing was performed by a liquid dispensing unit that is
capable of dosing microliters of titrants. The Wilhelmy plate method
was used to measure the dynamic surface tension at the air–water
interface. A total of 2 mM TX-100 and 30 mM SDS were titrated into
40 mL of water and CNC and CNC-CD suspensions at 25 °C respectively.
CTAB (5 mM) was titrated into 40 mL of water and CNC and CNC-CD suspensions
at 28 °C. In this paper, the concentration of CNC and CNC-CD
suspensions was 0.6 wt % for interactions with TX-100 and SDS and
0.1 wt % for the interaction with CTAB.

4.7 Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
The interactions between CNC, CNC-CD,
and surfactants were studied
using the MicroCal VP-ITC instrument. Stock solutions of 100 mM SDS,
5 mM TX-100, and 10 mM CTAB were prepared in advance and loaded to
a 282 μL syringe. CNC and CNC-CD suspensions with concentrations
described above were loaded to the 1.455 mL sample cell. The titrants
were injected into the sample cell at predetermined volumes of 1–10
μL in each injection. The enthalpy change of the interactions
was measured and reported in kJ/mol of the injectant and plotted against
surfactant concentration.

4.8 Zeta Potential
Mixtures of surfactant
and CNC or CNC-CD suspensions were prepared at selected surfactant
concentrations described on the ITC thermograms. Zeta potential measurements
were conducted in polystyrene cuvettes on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS90. The samples were sonicated and measured without dilution. This
method was used to determine the overall surface charge of CNC and
CNC-CD samples in the presence of ionic surfactants.

4.9 Phase Separation
Coacervation and
phase separation behavior were observed and examined in CTAB/CNC and
CTAB/CNC-CD samples. All samples were mixed and stabilized for 2 weeks
prior to the measurements. The height of the flocculation column was
normalized to the height of the total solution column with each sample
for ease of comparison.

4.10 Conductivity
The conductivity measurements
were performed on the Metrohm 809 Titrando System equipped with Tiamo
software, which can dose microliters of the titrant in each injection.
All the measurements were conducted in a jacketed vessel with a stirring
speed of 4. The same temperature and concentrations of surfactants
and CNC and CNC-CD suspensions were used as in surface tension measurements.
The conductivity was measured using a conductivity electrode.
