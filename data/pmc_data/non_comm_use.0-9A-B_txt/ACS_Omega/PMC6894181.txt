Unprecedented I2-catalyzed α,α-C(sp3)-H, decarboxylative α-C(sp3)-H, lactonized
α-C(sp3)-H, and α,β-C(sp3)-H
functionalized 5- and 6-annulation as well as α-C(sp3)-H activated 6-lactonization of primary aliphatic amines are devised
under aerobic conditions. The metal-free sustainable strategy was
employed for the diverse construction of valuable five-and six-membered
polycyclic N,O-heteroaromatics such
as oxazoles, 1,4-oxazines, and oxazin-2-one with a rapid reaction
rate and high yield. The viability of this mild nonmetallic catalysis
is successfully verified through syntheses of labile chiral heterocyclic
analogues. In contrast to the common practice, this method is not
limited to use of prefunctionalized amines, directing groups (DGs)
and/or transient DGs, metal catalysts, and traditional oxidants. The
possible mechanistic pathway of the annulation reaction is investigated
by control experiments and ESI-MS data collected for a reaction mixture
of the ongoing reaction. The synthesized new compounds are potent
organic nanobuilding blocks to achieve valuable organic nanomaterials
of different sizes, shapes, and dimensions, which are under investigation
for the discovery of high-tech devices of innovative organic nanoelectronics
and photophysical properties.

Introduction
Aliphatic primary amines are represented
in a wide range of chemical
feedstock and display great biological, pharmaceutical, agricultural,
materials, and synthetic applications.1−6 Of late, functionalization of C(sp3)-H has emerged as
a promising synthetic tool.7−10 The C(sp3)-H activated functionalization
of secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines is well investigated employing
transition-metal catalysts.11−14 However, site-selective functionalization of inactivated
C(sp3)-H bonds of primary aliphatic amines is more challenging
because of their strong nucleophilic, reducing, chelation, and deactivating
properties, which may hamper or deactivate catalytic power of the
possible metal catalysts. Thus, use of prefunctionalized amines, directing
group (DGs), and/or transient DG, their removal after the desired
transformation, and intramolecular annulation are frequently exercised
in the metal catalysis processes.15−18 A limited number of approaches
were devoted for the site-selective C(sp3)-H functionalization
of primary aliphatic amines, such as ZrIV/NiII-catalyzed α-selective cyclization,19,20 PdII-tuned β-arylation,21 PdII-AgI guided γ-substitution,18,22−25 and PdII-activated δ-arylation.26,27 However, a metal-free C(sp3)-H functionalization is always
a more appealing strategy to be developed for minimizing the harmful
impact on nature.28−30

So far, few nonmetallic C(sp3)-H
activation processes
were developed utilizing pyridine-N-oxide, TBAI/TBHP,
DTBP, hypervalent iodines, and iodine.31−37 Molecular iodine has emerged as an excellent catalyst38−43 because of its high solubility in the reaction media, easy handling,
low cost, and environmentally friendly nature in comparison to heavy
metals. The cyclization through C(sp3)-H functionalization
has become an indispensable synthetic strategy to deliver invaluable
heterocyclic molecules.44−50 Earlier, Schafer et al. introduced an α-C(sp3)-H
activated intramolecular 6-annulation with the Zr(NM2)4 catalyst ((i), Scheme 1).19 We established NiX2·nH2O-catalyzed bimolecular 5-annulation
((ii), Scheme 1).20 Chen et al. reported Pd(OAc)2-PhI(OAc)2-mediated intramolecular 4-annulation of protected primary
aliphatic amines ((iii), Scheme 1).26 The major limitations
of these methods are the utilization of toxic heavy metal catalysts,
intramolecular cyclization ((i) and (iii), Scheme 1), severe water susceptibility to catalysis
((ii), Scheme 1), high
reaction temperature (145 °C), requirements of a stoichiometric
oxidant [PhI(OAc)2] and base in excess (2.5 equiv.), and
slow reaction rates. In a continuous effort to synthesize novel polycyclic
heteroaromatics for design, synthesis, and fabrication of new organic
nanomaterials to discover their innovative organic electronic properties51−54 for developing new generation devices,55,56 herein, we disclose a direct C–O bond forming 5-annulation
((iv), Scheme 1) and
6-annulation ((v), Scheme 1) through C(sp3)-H functionalization through nonmetallic
catalysis to furnish polycyclic N,O-heteroaromatics.

Scheme 1 Annulation
with Primary Aliphatic Amine-C(sp3)-H
1,3-Oxazoles are a fundamental class of five-membered
privileged
heterocyclic motifs that have profound importance in natural products,
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.57−62 For instance, the benzoxazole-based natural product nataxazoles
(A, Figure 1) displayed anticancer, antibacterial, and cytotoxic bioactivities,61 and the heterocycle-grafted graphene oxide organic
material was used as a valuable high-performance supercapacitor electrode
(B, Figure 1).62 The widespread application of the
heterocycles led to the development of several synthetic strategies
such as CuII-catalyzed oxidative cyclization,63 [2 + 2 + 1] annulation of alkyne and nitrile,64 dehydrogenative annulation,65 PdII-catalyzed annulation of amides,66 and photocatalytic Ru catalysis.67 The importance of metal-free synthesis was also
realized using organocatalysis,68 cyclization
of aminoacids,69 PhIO-TfOH,70 and dehydrogenative I2-TBHP cyclization.71 1,4-Oxazines have shown immense importance in
biological and material sciences.72−80 For example, oxazine derivatives (C, D, Figure 1) were employed
in the treatment of neurodegenerative, inflammatory,78 autoimmune, and cardiovascular79 disorders, and the thin films of naphthoxazine-based materials (E, Figure 1) showed unique surface plasmon polarization with emission enhancement
properties. Syntheses of oxazines were mainly achieved through PdII catalysis of bisvinylphosphate81 and intramolecular cyclization with the CuI-catalyst82 and triphenylphosphine.83

Results and Discussion
Intending to synthesize the
heterocyclic moiety through nonmetallic
amine-C(sp3)-H functionalization, at first, we focused
on α-C(sp3)-H functionalization, and for that, we
have selected phenanthrenequinone (1a) and benzylamine
(2a) as two reacting partners, which might yield the
corresponding oxazole derivative (4a, Table 1). The feasibility of the 5-annulation
catalysis was examined with 20 mol % triflic acid and camphor sulfonic
acid (CSA) as possible catalysts (entries 1, 2, Table 1) under aerobic conditions in toluene at
100 °C (bath temperature) for 15 h. In these cases, the α,α-C(sp3)-H-amine derived oxazole was obtained successfully in moderate
yields (48, and 57%, respectively). To our delight, on the use of
I2, the reaction was rapidly completed (2 h), and the yield
significantly improved (79%, entry 3). Keeping I2 as a
promising catalyst (20 mol %), different solvents such as protic EtOH
(entry 4), relatively low boiling point EDC (entry 5), and highly
polar DMF and DME (entries 6, 7, respectively) were screened to achieve
moderate to high yields (58–78%). Gratifyingly, dioxane proved
to be the best reaction medium providing the desired product (4a) rapidly (1 h), and 4a was furnished almost
in quantitative yield (98%, entry 8). The increase in reaction time
(6 h) resulted in a decrease in yield of the desired product (95%,
entry 9). In the absence of oxygen (argon atmosphere), the yield drastically
dropped to 22% even after continuation of the reaction for 24 h (entry
10). Surprisingly, the change of catalyst loading (entries 11, 12)
led to a considerable decrease in the yield of the desired product
(4a). The 5-annulation was unsuccessful in the absence
of the catalyst under the same reaction conditions (entry 13).

The substrate scope of the dual α-C(sp3)-H-functionalized
5-annulation was investigated using a wide range of primary aliphatic
amines (2a–f, Scheme 2) and aromatic 1,2-diketones (1) under the developed optimized reaction conditions (entry 8, Table 1). The ester-substituted
primary amine (2b, Scheme 2) and phenanthrenequinone (1a) as well
as pyrene-based 1,2-diketones (1b) smoothly transformed
into the corresponding desired products (4b, 4c, Scheme 2), which
did not require any change in the developed reaction conditions (entry
8, Table 1).

Scheme 2 Dual α-C(sp3)-H-Functionalized 5-Annulation to Oxazoles
The presence of weak hydrophobic interactions
through the installation
of the hydrocarbon residue is frequently needed for the generation
of organic nanomaterials.51−56 Herein, use of n-butyl-, decyl-, and phenethylamine
(2c–e) was successful in achieving
corresponding potent nanobuilding blocks (4d–f) with high yields (77–90%) in 2–4 h. Hydrogen
bonding is one of the most common gluing interactions operating between
the organic nanounits, and the synthesis of an oxazole derivative
(4g) bearing the −OH group worked well with the
coupling partner aminoethanol (2f).

After dual
α-C(sp3)-H functionalization of various
primary aliphatic amines, we turned our attention for making the strategy
more diverse and general through replacement of one of the α-C(sp3)-H by −CO2H so that inexpensive and easily
available amino acids may be employed as the key substrate for decarboxylative
5-annulation. To our delight, the attempted reaction between phenyl
glycine (3a) and phenanthrenequinone (1a) rapidly (3 h) furnished the desired product (4a, Scheme 3) under similar reaction
conditions (entry 8, Table 1) with high yield (80%). Many aliphatic and aromatic residues,
phenolic −OH, alcoholic −OH, −SMe, and chirality
were well tolerated to produce a variety of polycyclic oxazoles in
high yield, and reaction rates were faster on use of a wide range
of amino acids (3a–k). In a competitive
experiment of cleaving C(sp3)-H versus −CO2H in glycine (3k) possessing two α-C(sp3)-H groups as well as one α-CO2H group furnished
oxazole derivative 4p through a decarboxylation process
exclusively, rather than formation of the −CO2H
group tethered oxazole derivative (4q) by functionalization
of consecutive two C(sp3)-H. Thus, C-CO2H breaking
is more favorable under the catalytic conditions with respect to C(sp3)-H cleavage. The structure of compound 4j is
established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.84 Further, 2,7-dibromo-phenanthrene-9,10-dione
under optimized reaction conditions (entry 8, Table 1) led to exclusive construction of corresponding
oxazole derivatives 4r and 4s through the
decarboxylation process.

Scheme 3 Decarboxylative α-C(sp3)-H-Functionalized 5-Annulation
Next, we envisioned functionalization of both
α-C(sp3)-H and β-C(sp3)-H under
the reaction conditions
leading to the construction of valuable six-annulated polycyclic oxazine
derivatives (Scheme 4). To verify that we have employed primary amines (5) possessing a β-C(sp3)-H, which was obtained by
just replacing the α-H with an alkyl group of 2 (Scheme 4). To our
surprise, six-annulated desired oxazine derivative 6a (Scheme 4) was rapidly
(2 h) formed upon treatment of 1-phenylethylamine (5a) with 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (1a) under the catalytic
conditions in high yield (80%). Herein, phenyl (6a, 6b, 6e, 6g, 6i) and
activated aromatic residues such as naphthyl (6c), 4-tolyl
(6d), 4-hydroxyphenyl (6h), and methyl [γ-C(sp3)-H, 6e) as well as the ester functionality (6g, 6h) are well tolerated to furnish selectively
polyaromatic oxazine systems (6a–i) in 2–8 h with high yields (68–81%). In the presence
of the cyclohexyl group, the desired product tautomerized to 6f through migration of a double bond. Probably, high steric
and electronic repulsion appeared due to the presence of axial and
equatorial C–H bonds (cyclohexyl residue) in the close vicinity
of the C=N bond and lone pair in 6fi, which
led to release of unwanted repulsive forces to obtain thermodynamically
stable and fully aromatic 3-cyclohexyl-4H-phenanthro[9,10-b][1,4]oxazines (6f).

Scheme 4 α,β-C(sp3)-H-Functionalized 6-Annulation to
Oxazines
To understand the reactivity and versatility
of the C(sp3)-H-functionalized annulation strategy, we
have replaced the R group
(5, Scheme 4) by a −CO2Et group in the aliphatic amines (7a–c, Scheme 5). To our surprise, a 6-annulation reaction
occurred under the reaction conditions through α-C(sp3)-H functionalization of the primary aliphatic amines as well as
an O–C coupling with the ester group involving the release
of −OEt to afford valuable polynuclearoxazine-2-ones (8a–c). The molecular-iodine-catalyzed
synthesis of 3-alkyl-2H-phenanthro[9,10-b][1,4]oxazin-2-one (8) was rapid (2–4.5 h) and
high yielding (72–77%). Formation of all new oxazoles, oxazines,
oxazine-2-ones, and analogues was confirmed by spectroscopic analyses,
recorded melting points (Supporting Information), and also single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analyses of 4j(84) and 6a.85 It is worthy to
note that, although most of the reported metal catalysts for C–H-activated
functionalization reactions are moisture-sensitive, herein, the catalyst
I2 efficiently performed the diverse C–H-functionalized
annulation catalysis even in the presence of water.

Scheme 5 α-C(sp3)-H-Functionalized Lactonization to Oxazine-2-ones
Out of several possibilities,86−91 the current catalysis is expected to pass through the initial formation
of a monoimine IA and IB, which may proceed
through activation of an α-C(sp3)-H subsequent formation
of a five-membered transition state (II) with the catalyst
(I2) to intermediates IIIA and IIIB (Scheme 6). The formation
of intermediates IA and IB, as well as IIIA and IIIB, was detected in the mass spectral
analyses of the ongoing reaction (Supporting Information). A second α-C(sp3)-H activation of IIIA with the close vicinity of the iodine substituent possessing lone
pairs and larger size (IV) may release HI to furnish
the dual α-C(sp3)-H-functionalized 5-annulated product
(4a, path a). On the other hand, decarboxylative α-C(sp3)-H 5-annulation of IIIB is possibly passing
through a six-membered transition state (V) to 4i (path b). In both cases, the generated HI is expected to
oxidize immediately by aerial O2 to regenerate I2 for the next catalytic cycle. The role of inexpensive O2 as an oxidant was verified (entry 10, Table 1) by performing the reaction in the absence
of O2 (argon atmosphere) where the yield of 4a drastically reduced (22%) in the presence of the catalyst. Herein,
decarboxylation through a six-membered transition state (V, path b, Scheme 6) is energetically more favorable than the second α-C(sp3)-H activation by a four-membered one (IV, path
a), which was reflected in the 5-annulation of glycine to produce
exclusively 4p instead of 4q.

Scheme 6 Mechanistic
Hypothesis for I2-Catalyzed 5-Annulation
The 6-annulation is expected to proceed in a
similar fashion through
the initial formation of a monoimine VI (Scheme 7), which may proceed via an
iodine-mediated activation of an α-C(sp3)-H through
an eight-membered transition state (VII). Removal of
HI leads to the generation of the putative intermediate VIII, which further tautomerizes to transition state IX.
It undergoes O–C coupled cyclization, oxidative C=N formation
(X) to desired product 6, and the regeneration
of molecular iodine for the next catalytic cycle.

Scheme 7 Mechanistic Hypothesis
for I2-Catalyzed 6-Annulation
Next, we moved to investigate morphological
characteristics of
some final compounds through fabrication by the spin coating method.
Thus, we choose three representative compounds, namely, 4n, 6b, and 6h, carrying strong aromatic
electron clouds, polar functional groups, phenolic −OH, van
der Waals interaction, and π–π stacking attractive
forces, which might operate in between the small organic molecules
(nanobuilding block) to fabricate the desired organic nanomaterials
through the spin coating, deep coating, and Langmuir–Blodget
techniques. The SEM images of the spin-coated materials displayed
nanomorphologies such as the existence of the rod-like structure of
compound 4n (Figure 2), the sheet-like architecture of compound 6b (Figure 3), and the
flower-like nanostructure of compound 6h (Figure 4). We are now investigating
the development of their innovative optical, nanoelectronics, and I–V characteristics for potential
application in the valuable solar cell, supercapacitor, and nonvolatile
memory devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a general
nonmetallic synthetic
strategy for diverse C(sp3)-H functionalization of unprotected
primary aliphatic amines with an I2 catalyst to intermolecular
5- and 6-annulation. A variety of unsubstituted, substituted, acid,
ester, alcohol, and thiol derivatives of primary amines and their
chiral analogues were successfully coupled to 1,2-diketone analogues
to obtain a series of new polyaromaticoxazoles, 1,4-oxazines, oxazin-2-one,
and chiral heterocycles with rapid reaction rates and high yields.
This newly established I2-catalyzed α,α-C(sp3)-H, decarboxylative α-C(sp3)-H, lactonized
α-C(sp3)-H, and α,β-C(sp3)-H-functionalized
5- and 6-annulation as well as α-C(sp3)-H-activated
6-lactonization of primary aliphatic amines will open up another avenue
for developing a metal-free sustainable strategy for simple, rapid,
and diverse construction of functional-group-decorated heteroaromatics,
which will find considerable application in organic synthesis, medicinal
chemistry, materials science, and organic nanoelectronics for smart
devices.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without further purification. Petroleum ether used
in our experiments was in the boiling range of 60–80 °C.
Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (100–200
and 230–400 mesh). Reported melting points are uncorrected.
Prior to melting point determination, recrystallization was carried
out; for compounds whose NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3, recrystallization was carried out in CDCl3, and for
those whose NMR spectra were taken in DMSO-d6, recrystallization was carried out in an ethyl acetate/hexane
mixture. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
at ambient temperature in CDCl3/DMSO-d6 solution. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ)
relative to internal reference tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants
are quoted in Hz (J). Proton multiplicities are represented
as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet),
q (quartet), and m (multiplet). Splitting patterns that could not
be interpreted are designated as multiplet (m). Infrared spectra were
recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer in thin films. HR-MS data were acquired
by electron spray ionization on a Q-tof-micro quadruple mass spectrophotometer.
X-ray crystallographic data were taken using an X-ray diffractometry
instrument.
