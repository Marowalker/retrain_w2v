Chemical
generation of singlet oxygen under biologically relevant
conditions is very important, considering the role played by singlet
oxygen in cancer therapeutics. We now demonstrate that a luminol derivative
can be chemically excited and transfer the excitation energy to the
covalently attached photosensitizer derived from erythrosin. A photosensitizer
module, when excited in this manner, can generate singlet oxygen in
solution. As hydrogen peroxide is present in a relatively high concentration
in cancer cells, singlet oxygen generation through chemical excitation
may evolve into an important therapeutic approach.

Introduction
Singlet oxygen is the
primary cytotoxic agent involved in photodynamic
therapy (PDT) of cancer.1 Generation of
singlet oxygen requires a photosensitizer, dissolved molecular oxygen,
and light of an appropriate wavelength for excitation of the photosensitizer.2 An excited photosensitizer should be capable
of undergoing efficient intersystem crossing3 so that energy transfer to the ground-state molecular oxygen can
take place. The fact that light is needed for the generation of singlet
oxygen is both an advantage (increased spatial selectivity) and a
disadvantage (light does not penetrate tissues to more than a few
millimeters). Attenuation of light as it passes through tissues is
one of the factors limiting the clinical practice of PDT to mostly
superficial lesions.4 Despite considerable
efforts to alleviate these problems with new light sources, photosensitizers,
and novel delivery methods, they seem to remain as intractable as
ever.5

There are proposed alternatives
to in vivo irradiative generation
of singlet oxygen, such as X-ray-induced scintillating nanoparticles6 or persistent luminescent nanoparticles. The
former approach attempts to excite using penetrating radiation,7 whereas the latter separates the excitation step
from the singlet oxygen generation step. Recently, we also introduced
the use of endoperoxide for the potential bypass of excitation altogether.8

In this work, our aim was to couple chemical
excitation with singlet
oxygen generation in a modular unimolecular system. The use of chemiluminescence
or bioluminescence as a source of excitation for photosensitizers
has been investigated previously.9 Unfortunately,
the conditions for efficient (nonradiative) energy transfer required
the use of a chemiluminescing agent and photosensitizer in large concentrations,
limiting the potential of this approach at conception. However, a
through-bond energy transfer to a photosensitizer would circumvent
the problem caused by two independent agents by directly generating
singlet oxygen upon chemical excitation. The synthesis of the target
compound, 11, was done in multiple steps from commercially
available products (Scheme 1). Compound 10 has been previously reported10 as an energy-transfer cassette. The final step
was halogenation of the xanthene nucleus to introduce heavy iodine
atoms to facilitate intersystem crossing. As expected, iodination
resulted in significant quenching of the fluorescence as it allows
rapid access to the triplet manifold.

and/or Easily Accessible Compounds
The
key intermediate, 10, was synthesized essentially following
a previously published procedure.10

Results and Discussion
The general design principle
is shown in Figure 1. The idea is to bring the chemiluminegenic
unit in close proximity to the photosensitizer, thus ensuring a highly
effective concentration. The chemiluminescence energy is likely to
be efficiently transferred by through-bond energy transfer, but considering
the short distance that the chemiluminogen can be placed at in relation
to the photosensitizer, a through-space energy transfer can be envisioned.
On triggering of the chemiluminescence reaction, the resulting excited-state
species would be expected to transfer their energy to the photosensitizer,
which in turn would sensitize singlet oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is
particularly relevant and important as a trigger compound for two
reasons: (i) it is known to be present in high concentrations in tumor
cells,11 in fact high enough to trigger
chemiluminescence and12 (ii) there are
several different chemiluminogen systems (oxalates, acridinium esters,
etc.) that can be activated by hydrogen peroxide.

The absorption spectrum of compound 11 (Figure 2) shows one peak in the visible
region at 530 nm. Introduction of four iodo substituents causes a
redshift in absorbance compared to that of a typical unsubstituted
xanthene dye.

Figure 2 Reaction of the singlet oxygen generated by photosensitization
with 47 μM 1,3-diphenyl-isobenzofuran (DPBF) in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) in the presence of erythrosine–luminol conjugate 11. For the first 8 min, the solution was kept in the dark;
thereafter, it was irradiated with a 520 nm light-emitting diode (LED)
array for 16 min. The total volume was adjusted to 3.0 mL. Absorbance
spectra were recorded in 2 min intervals.

We first wanted to demonstrate that a tetraiodoxanthene (erythrosin)-derived
module is satisfactory as a photosensitizer. To that end, a solution
of the erythrosin–luminol conjugate was prepared in a DMSO-containing
singlet oxygen trap, DPBF. When kept in the dark for 8 min, there
was no discernable change in the absorption spectrum (Figure 3). However, on irradiation
with a green LED (520 nm, fluence rate 2.5 mW/cm2), the
absorption peak due to the trap compound, DPBF, rapidly disappeared
in 14 min. This indicates that the photosensitizer module, which is
structurally related to erythrosin, retains a high level of photosensitization
capacity within the bifunctional construct.

Figure 3 Change in the absorbance
of 47.0 μM DPBF in DMSO in the presence
of 104.0 μM of compound 10 or 11.
The sample solutions contain 300 μL of pH 10.0 buffer solution
(Na2CO3 and NaHCO3). After 8 min,
chemical excitation is induced by 300 μL of 1.5 × 10–3 M CuSO4 and 2 × 10–3 M H2O2. The total volume was adjusted to 3.0
mL. Absorbance data were recorded in 2 min intervals.

The chemical generation of singlet oxygen was then
studied in DMSO
solution (Figure 3)
with a small amount of added aqueous buffer solution. Careful control
experiments were performed to eliminate other potential sources of
decrease in absorbance. The absorption of the singlet oxygen trap
(DPBF, black squares) was followed in the presence of carbonate buffer
(10% buffer, 90% DMSO volume percentage), catalytic Cu2+, and hydrogen peroxide (final concentration 0.20 mM). Compound 10 was also investigated under same conditions and showed
no change (red circles). However, compound 11, added
to the reaction mixture at t = 8.0 min, resulted
in a rapid decrease, leveling off, as expected, within 12 min. This
is also in accordance with the typical chemiluminescence kinetics
of luminol under comparable conditions. Naturally, due to the solubility
restrictions, the chemical excitation was tested under highly suboptimal
conditions. However, we estimated the chemical yield of singlet oxygen
on the basis of the concentration of compound 11 and
the decrease in the absorption of DPBF as 4.2%, which is promising
considering the chemical and photophysical processes involved in singlet
oxygen generation. The yield is most likely held restricted by the
solubility of molecular oxygen.

Conclusions
Our
previous work8b demonstrated that
a small amount of singlet oxygen generated within tumors may be sufficient
to induce apoptosis. We are confident that with appropriate modifications
to improve water solubility coupling singlet oxygen generation with
hydrogen peroxide levels will evolve into a promising methodology
for tumor therapy. Work in that direction is in progress in our laboratory.

Experimental
Section
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded
on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer (operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR). Chemical shifts are reported
in units of parts per million relative to those of the solvent peak
(CDCl3: 7.27 ppm for 1H and 77.0 ppm for 13C; D2O: 4.63 ppm for 1H). All spectra
were recorded at 25 °C, and the coupling constants (J values) are given in hertz. Chemical shifts are given in parts per
million. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary-100
spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were conducted on a Varian
Eclipse spectrofluorometer. Mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent
Technologies 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS system. Reactions were
monitored by thin-layer chromatography using Merck TLC Silica gel
60 F254. Silica gel column chromatography was performed
over Merck Silica gel 60 (particle size: 0.040–0.063 mm, 230–400
mesh ASTM). Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was obtained by refluxing over
sodium/benzophenone prior to use. All other reagents and solvents
were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification.
DPBF was used as the singlet oxygen trap.
