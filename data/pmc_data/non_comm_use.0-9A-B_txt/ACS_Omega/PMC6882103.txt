ZIF-8
is a flexible zeolitic imidazole-based metal–organic
framework and has been extensively studied because of its high structural
stability. However, ZIF-8 is hydrolyzed in water at higher temperature,
resulting in degradation of its crystalline and porous structure.
In order to prevent ZIF-8 from structural collapse due to the hydrolysis
reaction of the metal–ligand bond and/or ligand substitution
reaction, it is effective to shield the metal–ligand bond from
the attack of water molecules. This work reports on the thermal and
hydrothermal stability of mechanochemically synthesized ZIF-8 and
presents an incredibly simple step to modify the outermost surface
of ZIF-8, improving the hydrothermal stability. The partial carbonization
resulting in the formation of a carbon-rich outermost layer endowed
ZIF-8 with not only high hydrothermal stability but also a high adsorption
rate on liquid phase adsorption.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are a unique type of crystalline
microporous and inorganic–organic hybrid materials, which can
be simply self-assembled from metal ions/clusters and organic ligands.1−6 MOFs offer many interesting opportunities in adsorption and separation
technology because of their chemical and structural tunabilities.
Recently, the potential application of MOFs has been studied expanding
to liquid-phase separation in addition to gas-phase separation. There
is growing interest in extending the application of MOFs to liquid-phase
separations including bioalcohol dehydration/recovery,7,8 desalination,9−12 removal of trace organic contaminants,13−18 and so on. However, in such separations, especially in aqueous systems,
the use of many MOFs is ultimately limited by their hydrothermal stability.

Among the many MOFs, there are two major classes of stable MOFs:
the high-valent metal/cluster–carboxylate framework and low-valent
metal–imidazolate framework. A major factor for the greater
stability of high-valent metal/cluster–carboxylate MOFs, represented
by MIL-19 and UiO-type20 structures, is that their high metal coordination numbers
create a crowding effect, enhancing the strength of the metal–ligand
bond and preventing the formation of water clusters near the metal.
A series of ZIFs with the low-valent metal–imidazolate framework
have relatively high thermal and chemical stability compared to other
common MOFs.21 The relatively high water
stability of ZIF is believed to be due to the bonding strength between
Zn ions and imidazoles with a higher pKa and formation of the hydrophobic pore and surface. ZIF-8 (Zn(2-methylimidazole)2) is undoubtedly the most extensively studied because of its
stability coupled with a facile and diverse synthesis including vapor-,22−24 liquid-,25−29 and solid-phase30−34 processes. However, concerning the stability of ZIF-8, contradicting
results have been reported. Yaghi et al.25 and Low et al.21 demonstrated at the
outset that the crystalline structure and surface area of ZIF-8 remain
unchanged after immersing in boiling water or steaming at 300 °C.
On the other hand, Leus et al. reported that the structure and surface
area of ZIF-8 partially degrade in water.35 Zhang et al.36 and Duke et al.11 observed dissolution of ZIF-8 and release of
Zn2+ into water. Yang et al. showed evidence that ZIF-8
undergoes hydrolysis under hydrothermal conditions where transformation
to zinc oxide is thermodynamically preferred.37 Sheng et al.38 and Wang et al.39 also confirmed that ZIF-8 undergoes a phase
change in water and transforms into an amorphous or dense crystalline
product. More recently, Bhattacharyya et al. investigated the acid
gas stability of ZIF-8 and proposed its degradation mechanism, supported
by computational study, under CO2, NO2, or SO2 exposure.40−42 These findings strongly suggest that breakthroughs
to improve the stability of MOFs are required.

ZIF-8 is now
recognized as not having much high hydrothermal stability.
The enhancement of stability is one of the most important challenges
in the practical application of ZIF-8 for liquid-phase separation.
In order to prevent the crystalline and porous structure from structural
collapse due to a hydrolysis reaction of the metal–ligand bond
and/or ligand substitution reaction, it should be effective to shield
the metal–ligand bond from the attack of water molecules. Actually,
Walton et al. demonstrated that the water stability of Zn-based MOFs
is decreased or improved by incorporating hydrophilic/polar or hydrophobic/nonpolar
functional groups in the ligand, respectively.43 Yang et al. presented a strategy to improve the hydrothermal
stability of ZIF-8 through the so-called shell–ligand exchange
reaction, taking advantage of steric hindrance and water-repellent
effects.37 Inspired by these findings,
we present here an incredibly simple step to modify the outermost
surface of ZIF-8, improving the hydrothermal stability. The strategy
in this study is to use thermal treatment for ZIF-8 in an inert atmosphere,
partially carbonizing its outermost surface. ZIF-8 mass-produced by
mechanochemical synthesis enabled quantitative evaluation of structural
stability. In this contribution, we examine the thermal stability
of mechanochemically synthesized ZIF-8 and hydrothermal stability
of such a thermally treated ZIF-8.

Results and Discussion
Thermal
Stability
PXRD patterns of ZIF-8 in the first
efforts to evaluate its thermal stability are shown in Figure 1. According to our previous
report,32−34 the pristine ZIF-8 was prepared by mechanochemical
synthesis using zinc oxide, zinc acetate dihydrate, and 2-methylimidazole.
The PXRD pattern of mechanochemically synthesized ZIF-8 corresponds
to a family of lattice planes of a sodalite structure. As shown in Figure 1, the pristine ZIF-8
is a white powder, and its color changes from white to brown and finally
to black with increasing the thermal treatment temperature. There
is no significant difference in the macroscopic morphology observed
with FESEM between the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/450 (Figure S1). Here, the products thermally treated in a nitrogen
flow at x °C are designated as ZIF/x. The sodalite structure remained even after thermal treatment at
550 °C. However, in the PXRD pattern for ZIF/550, the intensity
of reflection peaks decreased significantly, and their peak positions
shifted slightly toward higher angles, suggesting loss of long-range
crystallinity with structural shrinkage. On the other hand, ZIF/650
shows no reflection peak attributed to a sodalite structure and has
an amorphous structure. In addition, new reflection peaks with extremely
low intensity appeared after thermal treatment above 550 °C,
which correspond to a family of lattice planes of zinc oxide.

The porous structure of thermally treated ZIF-8 was investigated
by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements shown in Figure 2. All the products show typical
type-I curves with a sharp increase in the adsorbed nitrogen amount
near P/P0 = 1, suggesting
the hierarchical micro- and mesoporous structure.33 The interparticle porosity between microporous particles
forms the mesoporous structure. There is no large difference in the
surface area (>1200 m2/g) among the products thermally
treated below 550 °C. Given the semilogarithmic scale, there
are differences in the type-I isotherms. The pristine ZIF-8 exhibits
a unique stepwise isotherm, as reported before by several groups.44−46 ZIF-8 crystallizes into the sodalite topology, generating a resistant
structure with large cages (1.16 nm) interconnected via narrow six-ring
windows (0.34 nm). The stepwise adsorption isotherm has been explained
based on adsorption-induced swinging of the linker and rearrangement
of the adsorbed molecules.47 Such adsorption
behavior gives ZIF-8 an interesting “gate-opening” functionality;
it is interesting to note that ZIF-8 can adsorb molecules with kinetic
diameters larger than its window size, such as propane, propylene,
and so on.48,49 ZIF/250, ZIF/350, and ZIF/450,
which were confirmed to have no structural change from PXRD results,
show stepwise isotherms as with the pristine ZIF-8. The first and
second branch of the isotherm almost overlaps for the pristine ZIF-8,
ZIF/250, ZIF/350, and ZIF/450 as well as for the micropore capacity,
indicating no large difference in the pore size distribution. Although
the appearance of ZIF/450 visually turned brownish, as a conclusion
of the characterization by the combination of PXRD and nitrogen adsorption/desorption
results, the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/450 are unlikely to make much
of a structural difference.

ZIF-8 and ZIF/x in linear (top) and semilogarithmic
(bottom) scales.

Hydrothermal Stability
Next, hydrothermal stability
tests were conducted on the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x. Most recently, Zhang et al. pointed out that inconsistent results
on water stability reported in the literature were caused by the relative
amount of the sample to water, time in contact with water, and sample
collection procedure.36 Following this
point, in this study, relatively long-term stability tests (for one
week) were conducted using a very small amount of samples (50 mg of
the sample immersed in 100 mL of water, 0.05 wt %). Since the particle
size of mechanochemically synthesized ZIF-8 was relatively large,
the solid samples could be easily collected by suction filtration
using filter paper with a nominal pore size of 1 μm. As shown
in Figure 3, the pristine
ZIF-8 preserved its crystalline structure after immersing in water
at room temperature for one week, which is in good agreement with
an earlier report by Yaghi et al.25 In
addition, no changes were observed in nitrogen adsorption isotherms
and surface areas, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. However, after immersing
in water at 90 °C for one week, the pristine ZIF-8 showed structural
collapse of the sodalite as well as transformation to different crystalline
structures, as evidenced by the loss of low-angle reflections and
appearance of new unknown reflections in the PXRD pattern. The decrease
of the nitrogen adsorption amount and surface area was also significant.
TEM observation supplemented the transformation of the pristine ZIF-8
into dense crystalline products under hydrothermal conditions (Figure S2).

(bottom) and after immersing water at room temperature (middle) and
90 °C (top).

isotherms of pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x before and
after immersing water at room temperature and
90 °C.

Figure 5 BET surface areas of pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x before
and after immersing water at room temperature and 90 °C.

ZIF/250 and ZIF/350 were slightly more stable to
hydrolysis than
the pristine ZIF-8. Surface area loss for ZIF/250 and ZIF/350 was
also suppressed compared to the pristine ZIF-8. On the other hand,
ZIF/450 was significantly more stable to hydrolysis than the pristine
ZIF-8. The PXRD pattern for ZIF/450 immersed in water at both room
temperature and 90 °C shows no structural degradation, as shown
in Figure 3. The nitrogen
adsorption isotherms and surface areas also hardly changed. In addition,
no dense products other than porous ZIF/450 were confirmed by TEM
observation after immersing ZIF/450 in water at 90 °C (Figure S2). ZIF-8, which underwent hydrolysis
under hydrothermal conditions, could be endowed with high hydrothermal
stability after thermal treatment at 450 °C in an inert atmosphere.
As for ZIF/550 or ZIF/650 whose structure was partially or totally
collapsed by previous thermal treatment, the surface areas significantly
decreased after immersing in water even at room temperature. It is
suggested that the mechanism of structural collapse between the pristine
ZIF-8 and ZIF/550 is different.

Mechanism for Enhancing
Hydrothermal Stability
As discussed
previously, the structural difference between the pristine ZIF-8 and
ZIF/450 could not be found from PXRD and nitrogen adsorption results.
Therefore, the difference in chemical structure was examined by FTIR
measurement. Figure 6 shows the FTIR spectra of the pristine ZIF-8, which are dominated
by intense bands corresponding to methyl group and imidazole ring
vibrations. The spectra bands of the mechanochemically synthesized
ZIF-8 are in good agreement with those presented by Ordoñez
et al.50 and Lin et al.51 The band observed at 420 cm–1 was assigned
to Zn–N stretching, while the overall weakening/broadening
of the convoluted bands observed at around 750, 1000, and 1400 cm–1 were attributed to entire-ring stretching, in-plane
bending, and out-of-plane bending of the imidazolium ring. Even after
thermal treatment at 450 °C, the overall chemical structure of
ZIF-8 seems to remain unchanged. The band attributed to the physical
adsorbed water decreased in intensity, indicating the surface change
to more hydrophobicity. On the other hand, for ZIF/650, the breaking
of Zn–N, the imidazolium ring, and the methyl group is evident
by the loss and broadening of corresponding spectral intensity. In
addition, the appearance of a broad band between 3000 and 3500 cm–1 indicates the hydrophilic nature of ZIF/650. In fact,
ZIF/650 can be easily dispersed in water, while the pristine ZIF-8
and ZIF/450 repel water and are hard to disperse in water. It is speculated
that the low water stability of ZIF/650 is due to the breaking of
Zn–N and the resulting elution of Zn-related species into water.

Figure 6 FTIR of
pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x.

FTIR results showed little difference in the overall chemical structure
between the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/450. Next, the surface composition
was characterized by XPS to monitor individual regions for Zn 2p,
C 1s, and N 1s at higher pass energy and resolution. The usual XPS
probing depth range is up to the outermost 10 nm of the sample depending
on the takeoff angle.52 The photoelectron
escape depth of pelletized samples in this study is estimated to be
approximately 4 nm. Figure 7 shows the outermost surface composition of the pristine ZIF-8
and ZIF/x. The outermost surface of the pristine
ZIF-8 is found to be Zn-rich relative to 2-methylimidazole in comparison
to the expected stoichiometric composition of C8H10N4Zn and terminated by hydroxyl and carbonate groups,
as already reported by Benz et al.53 On
the other hand, the outermost surface composition ratio of C/Zn increased
with increasing the thermal treatment temperature up to 450 °C
and reached a maximum of approximately 11 for ZIF/450. This result
indicates that a carbon-rich layer without Zn species was formed on
the outermost surface of ZIF/450. Although the thermal treatment temperature
of 450 °C is much lower than the boiling point of Zn (907 °C),
it is believed that the disappearance of Zn in the outermost surface
of ZIF-8 can be easily caused by the breaking of Zn–N. Several
of the literature has provided evidence of the vapor pressure that
solid metals including Zn evaporate under low pressures even at low
temperatures.54 With a further increase
in the thermal treatment temperature, the C/Zn ratio decreased due
to the dominant ligand decomposition. The outermost surface composition
ratio of N/C increased after a minimum decline for ZIF/450. It is
speculated that the hydrophobic nature of ZIF/450, which repels water,
is due to the formation of the carbon-rich layer with the lowest N
content. The amorphous layer was slightly observed on the surface
of ZIF/450 that was not observed in the pristine ZIF-8 (Figure S3). Although more detailed high-resolution
observations are required, it is speculated that the observed layer
corresponds to the carbon-rich layer. The thickness of the layer was
confirmed to be uniform within a range of approximately 2 to 5 nm.
Indeed, the weight loss of the pristine ZIF-8 by thermal treatment
at 450 °C was approximately 10% (Figure S4), which corresponds approximately to the weight ratio of the outermost
thickness of 5 nm for the pristine ZIF-8. A schematic illustration
for the structure of the outermost surface is proposed in Scheme 1. The thermal treatment
at 450 °C in an inert atmosphere to form such a carbon layer
on the outermost surface endows ZIF-8 with high hydrothermal stability.
The extremely simple step for formation of the water-repellent carbon
ultrathin layer is effective to shield the metal–ligand bond
from the attack of water molecules. On the other hand, the fact that
ZIF/550 and ZIF/650 are easily dispersed in water is attributed to
the high relative content of N on the surface (Figure S5). This result is in reasonable agreement with the
chemical structure including physically adsorbed water estimated by
FTIR.

Liquid-Phase Adsorption Property
ZIF-8 has been recognized
as a unique adsorbent with a flexible framework. It is interesting
to note that ZIF-8 can adsorb molecules with a kinetic diameter larger
than its window size. Herein, we discuss the adsorption performance
of organic pollutants on the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x to demonstrate its potential as a liquid-phase adsorbent. Hydroquinone
was chosen as a model molecule to test the liquid-phase adsorption
property. Figure 8 shows
the uptake curves of hydroquinone by the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x. There is no significant difference in the adsorbed amount
at equilibrium between the pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x thermally treated below 450 °C. The absence of a large difference
in the adsorbed amount of hydroquinone results from the lack of a
large difference in the overall microstructure including the surface
area. Thus, ZIF/550 or ZIF/650 whose structure was partially or totally
collapsed by thermal treatment shows lower adsorbed amounts of hydroquinone
compared to the pristine ZIF-8.

Figure 8 Uptake curves (top) and pseudo-second-order
plots (middle) of hydroquinone
by pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x and their adsorption
characteristics (bottom).

Although there is no significant difference in the adsorption capacities,
large differences in the adsorption kinetics are confirmed. It was
found that the kinetic adsorption performance of hydroquinone on the
pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x can be well-described by
a pseudo-second-order kinetic model55−57 where qt and qeq are the transient
and equilibrium adsorption amounts, respectively, and k is the pseudo-second-order rate constant. The constant k can be obtained from the intercept of the plot t/qt against t. Figure 8 shows a good linear
relationship between t/qt and t, indicating that the kinetic adsorption behavior
is well correlated with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.    

The adsorption rate constant k of hydroquinone
on ZIF/450 is much higher than that of hydroquinone on the pristine
ZIF-8 and another ZIF/x, as shown in Figure 8. The higher adsorption rate
of ZIF/450 with high hydrothermal stability demonstrated it as a better
adsorbent for liquid-phase adsorption than the pristine ZIF-8. The
enhancement in the adsorption rate suggests that the surface resistance
on diffusion of hydroquinone is reduced by pore size enlargement of
the outermost surface due to the disappearance of Zn in the carbon-rich
layer.

Conclusions
ZIF-8 is recognized
as one of the most stable MOFs. Nevertheless,
several of the literature shows that ZIF-8 undergoes hydrolysis under
hydrothermal conditions. Our experimental results also provided the
evidence that the structure and surface area of ZIF-8 degrade in water
at higher temperatures regardless of how ZIF-8 is synthesized. In
this contribution, we demonstrated an incredibly simple step to improve
the hydrothermal stability of ZIF-8. The partial carbonization resulting
in the formation of a carbon-rich outermost layer endowed ZIF-8 with
not only high hydrothermal stability but also a high adsorption rate
on liquid-phase adsorption. This simple strategy can be applied for
other MOFs and opens new opportunities for numerous liquid-phase adsorption
processes under severe conditions.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All the commercially available chemicals
were used without any further purification. Zinc oxide powders (nominal
particle size of 0.02 μm) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries. Zinc acetate dihydrate, 2-methylimidazole, and hydroquinone
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan.

Mechanochemical Synthesis
of ZIF-8
According to our
previous report,32−34 the pristine ZIF-8 was prepared by mechanochemical
synthesis using zinc oxide, zinc acetate dihydrate, and 2-methylimidazole.
Zinc oxide (1.8 g), 0.55 g of zinc acetate dihydrate, and 4.1 g of
2-methylimidazole were placed in a 250 mL ceramic pot containing 50
YTZ balls and then milled at a rotation rate of 150 rpm for 1 h by
using planetary mill Pulverisette 6 (Fritsch Japan). The products
were rinsed with methanol and then dried under reduced pressure at
40 °C.

Thermal Treatment for ZIF-8
The
pristine ZIF-8 was
heated in a tubular furnace with a nitrogen flow at 100 mL/min. The
furnace was heated at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min and then kept
at 250–650 °C for 3 h. The products treated at x °C were designated as ZIF/x.

Hydrothermal
Stability Test
Fifty milligrams of the
dried samples, pristine ZIF-8 and ZIF/x, was immersed
in 100 mL of water at room temperature or 90 °C for one week
with stirring. ZIF/550 and ZIF/650 could be easily dispersed in water,
resulting in a suspension. On the other hand, the pristine ZIF-8,
ZIF/250, ZIF/350, and ZIF/450 were floated on the water surface at
first, and then a suspension could be obtained with vigorous stirring
in a few minutes. The solid samples were collected by suction filtration
using filter paper with a nominal pore size of 1 μm.

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
were recorded on a MiniFlex 600 (Rigaku) by using Cu Kα radiation
with λ = 1.5418 Å; the copper anode was operated at 30
kV and 15 mA. N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at
77 K using a BELSORP-max (MicrotracBel Japan). Before adsorption measurement,
the samples were degassed at 200 °C under vacuum. The Brunauer–Emmette–Teller
(BET) model surface area was calculated from the nitrogen adsorption
branch. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images
were recorded on S-4800 (Hitachi High-Tech). Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) images were recorded on JEM-2010 (JEOL). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out with a DTG-60H (Shimadzu) under a nitrogen
flow at 100 mL/min. FTIR spectra were recorded on an IRAffinity-1
spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) using a KBr pellet method. XPS spectra
were recorded on a JPS-9000MX spectrometer (JEOL) using Mg Kα
radiation as the energy source.

Liquid-Phase Adsorption
Liquid-phase adsorption experiments
were carried out at room temperature by agitating 10 mg of the sample
in 10 mL of 50 ppm hydroquinone solution. After adsorption, the hydroquinone
concentration was determined using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
UV-2450 (Shimadzu).
