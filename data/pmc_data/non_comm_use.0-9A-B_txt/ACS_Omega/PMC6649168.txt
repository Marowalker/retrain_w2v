The {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes possessing three
kinds of encapsulated ions (X
= F–, Ø, Li+), three various ligands
(L = CO, PPh3, NHCMe), and twelve cage sizes
(C60, C70, C72, C74, C76, C78, C80, C84, C86, C90, C96, C100) are theoretically
examined by using the density functional theory (M06/LANL2DZ). The
present computational results demonstrate that the backward-bonding
orbital interactions, rather than the forward-bonding orbital interactions,
play a dominant role in the stability of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes. Additionally, our
theoretical study shows that the presence of the encapsulated Li+ ion can greatly improve the stability of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes, whereas
the existence of the encapsulated F– ion can heavily
reduce the stability of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes. Moreover, the theoretical evidence
strongly suggests that the backward-bonding orbital interactions as
well as the stability increase in the order {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(CO)2 < {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(PPh3)2 < {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(NHCMe)2. As a result, these theoretical observations
can provide experimental chemists a promising synthetic direction.

1 Introduction
About
three decades ago, Fagan and co-workers reported the synthesis
of the first fullerene-transition metal complex (FTMC), (η2-C60)Pt(PPh3)2.1 From then on, various kinds of FTMC have been
prepared and structurally characterized.2,3 An interesting
characteristic for such an FTMC is that it can encage atoms, ions,
and small molecules to form endohedral complexes,4 which is named endohedral metallofullerenes,5 because the metal atoms are encapsulated within
a hollow carbon cage. Since then, many other experimental and computational
works in such fields concerning cation-/anion-encapsulated fullerene
chemistry have been greatly achieved.6−13 Recently, Tobita and co-workers reported the preparations and structural
characterizations of the intriguing FTMC, that is, iridium and platinum
complexes of the lithium-cation-encapsulated fullerene Li+@C60.14

In principle,
from the theoretical viewpoint, two kinds of intramolecular
orbital interactions, which can affect the kinetic as well as the
thermodynamic stability of such an FTMC, are noted.15,16 One is the forward-bonding interaction, which is named σ forward-donation.
The other is the backward-bonding interaction, which is called π
backward-donation.17 Basically, both bonding
orbital interactions can be influenced by several factors, including
the central transition metal element, the encapsulated ion, the attached
ligand, and the cage size. The effects of the transition metal elements
and the encapsulated ions on the stability of the FTMC have been discussed
by the same authors.18 Nevertheless, in
the present work, we extend our previous study by considering the
other factors, such as various ligands and carbon cages, by way of
either forward-bonding or backward-bonding interactions, to study
how they qualify the stability of FTMC. In this regard, the following
chemical reaction is selected as the model system 1  where the encapsulated site
X could be F–, Ø, or Li+; the ligand
L could be CO, PPh3, or NHCMe (methyl-substituted
N-heterocyclic carbenes); and the cage size n could
be 60, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 86, 90, 96, or 100. That is to
say, a theoretically sophisticated method, that is, energy decomposition
analysis (EDA),19 has been utilized in
this study to investigate the intramolecular orbital interactions
between the various fullerenes and the platinum fragment (PtL2). It should be noted that the PtL2 fragment is
generated by the decoordination of C2H4 from
the (η2-C2H4)PtL2 complex. The decoordination of C2H4 involves
a small change in energy [(η2-C2H4)PtL2 → C2H4 + PtL2, ΔE = 15.5, 21.5, and 6.7 kcal/mol
for L = CO, PPh3, and NHCMe, respectively].
Hopefully, the present theoretical conclusions can provide experimental
chemists to design and to synthesize the novel FTMC.

2 Methodology
The following fullerenes that comply with the
isolated pentagon
rule are used to develop a correlation: Ih-C60, D5h-C70, D6d-C72, D3h-C74, D2-C76, C2v(3)-C78, D5d(1)-C80, D2d(23)-C84, Cs(16)-C86, D5h(1)-C90, D3d(3)-C96, and D5d(1)-C100. Most of these fullerenes have been experimentally isolated and
identified.20−25 The symmetry and numbering scheme for fullerene isomers are in accordance
with an approved classification.26 The
geometry optimizations have no symmetry restrictions for the M0627/LANL2DZ28,29 level of theory. The
harmonic vibrational frequency calculations are used to verify the
nature of the stationary points. The local minima are confirmed by
the absence of imaginary frequencies. The natural charges are obtained
using NBO 5.9, as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program.30 Advanced EDA unites the natural orbitals for
chemical valence (NOCV), so the total orbital interactions are separated
into pairwise contributions.31,32 Advanced EDA (i.e.,
EDA-NOCV) further divides the interaction energy [ΔE(INT)] into three main components: ΔE(INT)
= ΔEelstat + ΔEPauli + ΔEorb. This
enables a quantitative study of π back-bonding to fullerene
ligands that uses the M06/TZP level of theory with the ADF 2016 program
package.33 The relativistic effect is accounted
for by applying a scalar zero-order regular approximation.34 The interaction energy and its decomposition
terms are obtained from a single-point calculation, using the M06/TZP
basis set from the Gaussian 09 optimized geometry.

3 Results and Discussion
On the basis of the isolated pentagon
rule,26 one may obtain the following fullerenes:
Ih-C60, D5h-C70, D6d-C72, D3h-C74, D2-C76, C2v(3)-C78, D5d(1)-C80, D2d(23)-C84, Cs(16)-C86, D5h(1)-C90, D3d(3)-C96, and D5d(1)-C100, whose Cartesian coordinates
are given in the Supporting Information (Scheme 1). The choice
of these fullerene cages is
arbitrary and just for consistency, in spite of the fact that some
of them have been successfully identified by experimental methods38−40 and some of them are still not observed experimentally. For fullerene
isomers shown in Scheme 1, their symmetries and numbering schemes are in accordance with an
approved classification.41 It has to be
noted that Hückel molecular orbital calculations indicate the
6:6 ring junctions at the poles of the molecules, which usually have
the highest π bond orders (B) and then presumably should be
the highest reactive sites. In other words, these sites having the
highest π bond orders should be easily attacked (Scheme 1).35 After considering the cost and available computational facilities,
however, we have no choice but to select one isomer, which has an
oval-shaped structure, for different kinds of fullerenes. Nevertheless,
it may or may not influence the final conclusions presented in this
work.

of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes possessing the encapsulated site X (=F–, Ø, Li+), the ligand L (=CO, PPh3, and
NHCMe), and cage size n (=60, 70, 72,
74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 86, 90, 96, 100) were optimized at the M06/LANL2DZ
level of theory. The geometries obtained and their key structural
parameters for n = 60 are given in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. The key structural parameters
for other cage sizes are presented in the Supporting Information.

First, the geometric changes that
are caused by encapsulated ions
are considered. For the Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex in the absence of encapsulated ions, Table 1 shows the optimized Pt–C1(C2) and C1–C2 bond distances
[2.114 (2.116) and 1.513 Å, respectively], which agree well with
the corresponding experimental values [2.145 (2.115) and 1.502 Å,
respectively].1 After the Li+ ion is introduced into the cage, the optimized Pt–C1(C2), C1–C2, and Li–C1(C2) bond distances [2.106 (2.103), 1.552, 2.278
(2.279) Å, respectively] are also consistent with the experimentally
observed values [2.083 (2.084), 1.534, and 2.251 (2.249) Å, respectively].14 It is known that in a strained olefin complex,
strain reduces the energy of π* orbitals and increases π
backward-donation, which stretches the interacting C–C bond.
Also, it is noted that, in the presence of a Li+ ion, its
C–C bond distance is 0.039 Å longer than the corresponding
distance for an empty complex. On the other hand, if a F– ion is encapsulated, its C–C distance is 0.021 Å shorter
than the corresponding distance for an empty complex. These results
clearly show that a F– ion causes geometric changes
that are opposite to those that are caused by a Li+ ion,
so the effect on π backward-bonding orbital interactions is
diverse. The F–C bond (3.165 Å) is also substantially
longer than the Li–C bond (2.278 Å). The F– ion is located at a site farther from the Pt atom. In other words,
this phenomenon can be explained by the electrostatic interaction.

Besides these, the Pt-coordinated carbon atoms of C60 are negatively charged because there is π backward-donation
from the Pt center. From Table 1, the NPA shows that, for a Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex without encapsulated ions, the atomic charges
on the C1 (C2) atoms are −0.23 (−0.23).
On the other hand, if the cage is encapsulated by a Li+ ion, the computational data given in Table 1 indicate that the atomic charges on the
C1 (C2) atoms are increased to −0.28
(−0.28) and the atomic charge on the Li atom is +0.86. That
is to say, the theoretical evidence demonstrates that the encaged
Li+ ion is attracted toward these negatively charged carbon
atoms. However, if a F– ion is encapsulated, the
NPA results collected in Table 1 reveal that the atomic charges on the C1 (C2) atoms are decreased to −0.20 (−0.20) and the
atomic charge on the F atom is negative (−0.93). These theoretical
data strongly suggest that the negatively charged carbon atoms repel
the encaged F– ion.

The effect of ligands
on the geometric changes is also examined
in this work. As seen in Table 1, for the case of the Pt(NHCMe)2-C60 complex, which has a deficiency of encapsulated ion, its
C–C bond distance (1.535 Å) is longer than the corresponding
distance for an empty Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex (1.513 Å). By contrast, if the ligand is replaced by
CO, its C–C bond distance for the Pt(CO)2-C60 complex (1.489 Å) is shorter than the corresponding
distance for an empty Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex. Therefore, similar to encapsulated ions (Li+ and F– ions), ligands (NHCMe and CO)
also produce geometric changes that are opposite. As a result, their
effect on π back-bonding is specific. A detailed discussion
of the effect on π backward-donation is given in Section 3.3. Similar geometric
changes and charge populations are also seen for other cage sizes
and are presented in Tables S1–S11.

3.2 EDA
Before analyzing the influence
of endohedral species and ligands on the stability of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes,
we summarized the calculated energies of the formation of encaged
complexes X@Cn in Table 2. For the Li+@C60 and
F–@C60 cases, the encapsulation energies
are both negative values (−13.3 and −87.3 kcal/mol,
respectively), indicating Li+ and F– ions
are stabilized in the C60 cage and the latter is much more
stable. These theoretical findings agree well with the previous work
by Geerlings and co-workers.6 Also, it
is found that the encapsulation energies for other cages are similar
and do not change obviously (in average, Li+@Cn: −17.1, F–@Cn: −81.3 kcal/mol), implying the interaction
between the encapsulated ions and fullerene is rather local and therefore
not much dependent on the fullerene cage.

theory.

We then perform
EDA35−37 on the {η2-(X@C60)}PtL2 complexes, and their calculated results are collected in Table 3. In addition, the
EDA results for other cage sizes are presented in the Supporting Information. The bonding energy (ΔE) is defined as ΔE = E({η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2) – E(X@Cn) – E(PtL2), using eq 1. During the formation of the Pt–C
bond, the EDA results indicate that both PtL2 and the empty
C60 are distorted (Table 3). The PtL2 unit encounters greater distortion
[ΔEdef(A) = 29.4 kcal/mol] than
C60 [ΔEdef(B) = 9.9 kcal/mol].
Likewise, similar consequences are found for X = Li+ or
F–. Moreover, the encapsulation of the Li+ ion can cause more distortion in fragments A and B of {η2-(Li+@C60)}Pt(PPh3)2 than those of {η2-(F–@C60)}Pt(PPh3)2. That is, ΔΔEdef(X = Li+) = 8.0, ΔΔEdef(X = F–) = −3.5
kcal/mol). Nevertheless, when the Li+ ion is encapsulated,
the interaction energy increases [i.e., ΔΔEintA(BC)(X = Li+) = −33.3, ΔΔEintA(BC)(X = F–) = +15.9 kcal/mol].
In other words, the encapsulated Li+ ion evokes a stronger
interaction between the X@C60 and Pt(PPh3)2 moiety. This, in turn, as demonstrated in Table 3, can make {η2-(Li+@C60)}Pt(PPh3)2 to
be more stable. In consequence, the relative stability decreases in
the trend X = Li+ > X = Ø > X = F–. When the ligand is replaced by NHCMe, similar results
are obtained for Pt(NHCMe)2-C60 complexes,
but NHCMe causes more distortion in fragment A or B than
in the corresponding Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex. This phenomenon can make this PtL2 complex to
be less stable. For example, ΔE(L = NHCMe, X = Li+) = −64.2 > ΔE(L = PPh3, X = Li+) = −69.8
kcal/mol.
If the ligand is the CO group, the relative stability still follows
the same order: X = Li+ > X = Ø > X = F–. Nevertheless, the presence of CO causes less interaction
energy
between the PtL2 unit and X@C60 than for the
corresponding Pt(PPh3)2-C60, which
yields a less stable complex. For instance, ΔE(L = CO, X = Li+) = −21.2 > ΔE(L = PPh3, X = Li+) = −69.8 kcal/mol.
When the cage size is increased, the encapsulated Li+ ion
still increases the interaction energy [ΔEintA(BC)] between the Pt fragment and X@C60. Also,
both NHCMe and CO can produce more distortion energy (ΔEdef) and less interaction energy [ΔEintA(BC)] than the corresponding Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complex. This theoretical evidence
demonstrates that an increase in the cage size has no effect on the
EDA results (see Tables S12–S22).

3.3 EDA Using
the Extended Transition State (ETS)-NOCV
Method
In our earlier study,16 structural parameters and some characteristics were used to estimate
the strength of π backward-donation for {η2-(X@C60)}ML2 (M = Pt, Pd; X = Ø, Li+; L = PPh3) complexes. In other words, the changes
in the chemical shift (Δδ), bond length (Δr/r0), and bond angle (Δθav) can all be utilized to represent the bonding characters
of the {η2-(X@C60)}ML2 complexes.
In this study, from an energetic viewpoint, the strength of the π
back-bonding can be estimated using an ETS-NOCV method, which is a
variational way that was derived from the early EDA.44,45 These theoretical analyses exhibit the effect of substituents, cage
sizes, and encapsulated ions on the π backward-bonding interactions.

3.3.1 Effect of Encapsulated Ions on π Backward-Bonding
In Section 2.2, it has been demonstrated that stabilities increase
in the order X = F– < X = Ø < X = Li+, because the interaction energy [ΔEintA(BC)] is increased. The interaction between X@Cn and PtL2 is now studied using the
ETS-NOCV method, from which one may separate ΔEintA(BC) into three components: ΔEelstat (electrostatic interaction energy) + ΔEPauli (repulsive Pauli interaction energy) +
ΔEorb (orbital interaction energy).
In the present work, only the important pairwise contributions to
ΔEorb are considered, which are
listed in Tables 4–6 (similar ETS-NOCV results for
the other cage sizes are given in the Supporting Information). A plot of the deformation density and a qualitative
drawing of the orbital interactions between PtL2 and X@C60 are schematically shown in Figure 2.

Table 4 reveals
that both ΔEelstat and ΔEorb can stabilize the Pt(PPh3)2-C60 complexes because they are negative terms.
Nevertheless, the percentage of ΔEorb decreases in the order ΔEorb (X
= Li+) > ΔEorb (X
= Ø)
> ΔEorb (X = F–). In other words, the encapsulated Li+ ion plays a decisive
role for the stability of FTMC. Besides, Table 4 indicates that ΔEπ contributes significantly to ΔEorb: 60.7 for X = F–, 66.6 for X = Ø,
and 66.5% for X = Li+. Moreover, the energy order for ΔEπ (kcal/mol) is |ΔEπ (X = F–)| = 72.3 < |ΔEπ (X = Ø)| = 92.2 < |ΔEπ (X = Li+)| = 115.1. Therefore,
ΔEπ is increased when there
is an encapsulated Li+ ion but decreased when there is
a F– ion. Indeed, as seen in the deformation densities
in Figure 2, the electron
densities come from the π backward-donation of a filled d orbital
to the π* orbitals of C60 (the charge flow is yellow
to green in Figure 2). In other words, these EDA findings for the large contribution
of ΔEπ in ΔEorb demonstrate that the Pt–C bonds are principally
formed by π backward-donation, which agrees well with the previous
work.14

On the other hand, the second
contribution, which is named the
σ forward-donation (ΔEσ), results from a filled π orbital of C60 to the
σ orbital of Pt, as depicted in Figure 2. Comparing ΔEσ with ΔEπ shown
in Table 4, the contribution
of ΔEσ to ΔEorb is small: 20.6 for X = F–, 15.3
for X = Ø, and 11.3% for X = Li+. Similar results
are found for NHCMe and CO ligands, as analyzed in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

In brief, our computational results
strongly suggest that the π
backward-bonding is crucial to the stability of {η2-(X@C60)}PtL2 complexes and that an encapsulated
Li+ ion increases the π backward-bonding, whereas
an encapsulated F– decreases the π backward-bonding.
The effect of encapsulated ions on π backward-bonding interactions
is the same for other cage sizes (see the Supporting Information).

3.3.2 Effect of Ligands on
π Backward-Bonding
A comparison of the results in Tables 4 (L = PPh3) and 5 (L = NHCMe) demonstrates
that the value of ΔEπ for
Pt(NHCMe)2-C60 is larger than the
corresponding value for Pt(PPh3)2-C60. Thus, our theoretical findings indicate that the π backward-bonding
promoted by the NHCMe ligand is stronger than that by the
PPh3 ligand. For instance, |ΔEπ (L = PPh3, X = Li+)| = 115.1
< |ΔEπ (L = NHCMe, X = Li+)| = 142.8 kcal/mol. However, a comparison of Tables 4 (L = PPh3) and 6 (L = CO) reveals
that the value of ΔEπ for
Pt(CO)2-C60 is smaller than that for Pt(PPh3)2-C60. In other words, the π
backward-bonding induced by a CO group is weaker than that by a PPh3 ligand. For example, |ΔEπ (L = CO, X = Li+)| = 91.9 < |ΔEπ (L = PPh3, X = Li+)| = 115.1
kcal/mol. This theoretical evidence indicates that the π backward-bonding
is promoted by the ligand, which increases in the order |ΔEπ (L = CO)| < |ΔEπ (L = PPh3)| < |ΔEπ (L = NHCMe). This order is governed
by the nature of ligands. It is well known that CO is a strong π-acceptor
ligand.38 This, in turn, can greatly reduce
electrons from the σ orbitals of Pt to the π* orbitals
of C60, leading to fewer electrons in the π orbitals
of C60. On the other hand, NHCMe is a weaker
π-acceptor ligand.39,40 As a result, fewer
electrons from the d orbital of Pt transfer to the π* orbitals
of NHCMe, resulting in more electrons in the π* orbitals
of C60.

In addition, the ETS-NOCV results (Tables 4–6) demonstrate that the {η2-(X@C60)}PtL2 complexes exhibit a relatively strong σ
character when X = F– or L = CO and a relatively
strong π character when X = Li+ or L = NHCMe. For instance, in the {η2-(F–@C60)}Pt(CO)2 complex, its ΔEσ and ΔEπ contributions to the orbital interaction (ΔEorb) are calculated to be 35.1 and 49.6%, respectively.
Moreover, in the {η2-(Li+@C60)}Pt(NHCMe)2 complex, its ΔEσ and ΔEπ contributions to ΔEorb are computed to be 10.0 and 76.4%, respectively. To the authors’
best knowledge, many of the known organometallic compounds that have
fullerene (C60) as a ligand exhibit η2 hapticity and examples of other forms of hapticity (such as η1 or η5,6) are few. The reason for this could
be due to the high degree of curvature of a C60 cage. Theoretically,
complexes with η1 or η5,6 hapticity
can be constructed using an artificial force16 or a symmetry constraint.42 However,
this work demonstrates that another way to construct a complex with
η1 hapticity is to use X = F– or
L = CO in the complex. This study successfully locates the {η1-(F–@C60)}Pt(CO)2 complex
without using an artificial force or a symmetry constraint (see Figure S1).

3.3.3 Effect
of Cage Sizes on π Backward-Bonding
A plot of the ΔEπ values
versus cage sizes n (=60, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80,
84, 86, 90, 96, and 100) for {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(PPh3)2 is presented in Figure 3. Also, the computational
data concerning ΔEπ versus n for {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(CO)2 and {η2-(X@Cn)}Pt(NHCMe)2 are given in Figures S2 and S3, respectively. As seen in Figure 3, the ΔEπ values are calculated to be −115.0,
−95.0, and −75.0 kcal/mol for X = Li+, Ø,
and F– for each cage size, respectively. In other
words, the difference in the size of carbon clusters does not have
an apparent trend on π backward-bonding orbital interactions
for the platinum center. Presumably, the cage sizes we have chosen
in this work are enough to represent a clear relationship between
the cage size and the π backward-donation.

60, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 84, 86, 90, 96, and 100) complexes. The
solid circles, hollow circles, and solid triangles represent the values
of ΔEπ for X = Li+, Ø, and F–, respectively.

4 Conclusions
This
study uses the density functional theory to determine the
roles played by forward-bonding orbital interactions (σ forward-donations)
and backward-bonding orbital interactions (π backward-donations)
on the stability of {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes. Three factors, including encapsulated
ions, ligands, and cage size, have been chosen to examine their influences
on both orbital interactions. The computations studied in this work
demonstrate that the π backward-donation interactions rather
than the σ forward-donation interactions play a crucial role
in rendering {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes synthetically accessible. Moreover, our
theoretical investigations suggest that the π backward-donation
for {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complexes can be improved by the presence of an encapsulated
Li+ ion. This, in turn, can greatly increase the stability
of the {η2-(X@Cn)}PtL2 complex and promote its synthetic formation. Also, because
the electron donation ability increases in the order CO < PPh3 < NHCMe, our theoretical observations again
show that the electron donation of the attached ligand of a platinum
fragment greatly enhances the stability of the {η2-(Li+@Cn)}PtL2 complex.
