Materials that exhibit responsiveness
toward biological signals
are currently subjected to intense research in the field of drug delivery.
In our study, we tried to develop cancer-targeted and redox-responsive
nanoparticles (NPs) from disulfide-linked oxidized cysteine-phenylalanine
(CFO). The NPs were conjugated with folic acid (FA) to specifically
target cancer cells, and the presence of disulfide bonds would enabled
the disintegration of the particles in the presence of elevated levels
of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells. Anticancer drug doxorubicin
(Dox) was successfully loaded inside the disulfide-linked nanoparticles
(CFO-Dox-NPs), which further demonstrated stimuli-responsive drug
release in the presence of GSH. We have also demonstrated enhanced
uptake of FA-derivatized NPs (FA-CFO-NPs) in cancerous cells (C6 glioma
and B16F10 melanoma cells) than in normal cells (HEK293T cells) due
to the overexpression of FA receptors on the surface of cancer cells.
Cytotoxicity studies in C6 cells and B16F10 cells further revealed
enhanced efficacy of Dox loaded (FA-CFO-Dox-NPs) as compared to the
native drug. The findings of this study clearly demonstrated that
the disulfide-linked nanoparticle system may provide a promising selective
drug delivery platform in cancer cells.

Introduction
According to the latest
epidemiological data, the number of cancer
cases and death rates are increasing day to day. In 2018, approximately
9.6 million cancer-related deaths were reported worldwide, that is,
a death rate of ∼1 in 6.1 Cancer
carries a high probability of being cured if diagnosed right at the
inception and treated effectively.2 Despite
tremendous research in the field of cancer therapy, that is, surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, still there is a dearth of effective
methods to cure cancer. Though research in the field of cancer chemotherapy
has drawn continuous attention since the last few decades, it is still
suffering from limitations such as fast elimination of the drug molecules,
low solubility of most of the chemotherapeutics, and drug resistance.3 As an alternative strategy to conventional methods,
nanotechnology has shown tremendous potential in the field of effective
cancer therapy.4−6 Current trends in the development of cancer-targeted
nanotherapeutics harbor a long list of nanoparticulate systems such
as polymeric micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, etc.7 While the incorporation of NP-based therapy has offered
interesting continuous progress in cancer therapy, there is skepticism
concerning their harmful outcome at the molecular and cellular levels.8 Even polymeric NPs based on polymethyl methacrylate,
polystyrene, polyacrylamide, etc. have been reported to educe undesirable
toxicity owing to their poor biodegradability.9 Recent advancement shows significant progress in drug delivery applications
of peptide-based nanoparticles. Many small and large peptides with
designed structures are being used to synthesize different types of
nanostructures.10−12 However, short di- or tripeptide-based self-assembled
NPs seem to be more encouraging because of their simple structure,
ease of synthesis, and excellent biocompatibility as compared to longer
peptide-based NPs or polymeric NPs. Therefore, switching over to inherently
more biocompatible, more biodegradable NPs comprising of peptides could be a smart choice owing to
their superior biocompatibility and reduced toxicity.13,14 These peptide nanostructures can be specifically designed and synthesized
with ease through the process of molecular self-assembly, easily functionalized/conjugated
with various ligands to specifically target different cell surface
receptors to heighten the therapeutic efficacy of entrapped bioactive
molecules.15 Several peptide-based self-assembled
nanostructures have been explored for their ability to deliver therapeutic
molecules into different cancer cells and tissues.16

Though nanoparticulate-based drug delivery systems
have importance
in actively or passively taking therapeutic molecules to their sites
of action by protecting them from systemic degradation along with
minimizing nonspecific side effects, just reaching the site of action
using a nanocarrier is not enough until the loaded cargo is properly
released at the site of action in therapeutically relevant concentrations.
Keeping this aspect in mind, continuous progress has been made in
developing stimuli-responsive nanoparticles that can disintegrate
in response to a particular stimuli17,18 such as pH,19 light,20−22 oxidative reactions,23 reductive reactions of disulfide-thiol chemistry,24,25 etc., conferring site-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic molecules
for enhancing drug efficacy and mitigating nonspecific side effects.
The difference in redox environments exists between intra- and extracellular
milieu and can be elegantly harnessed for achieving site-specific
cell-triggered drug delivery, and a lot of efforts are being made
in this direction.26,27 Living cells harbor a number
of redox processes such as the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADP+/NADPH) system, oxygen/superoxide (O2/O2·–) system, and the glutathione
(GSH/GSSG) system. Since GSH exhibits significantly high intracellular
concentrations (1–10 mM) compared to a concentration below
10 μM in extracellular environments, the GSH/GSSG system has
gained much interest from researchers working in the area of stimuli-triggered
drug delivery. GSH has the ability to trigger thiol–disulfide
exchange in polymers containing disulfide bridges, and hence, NPs
generated from polymers containing disulfide bridges can be disassembled
intracellularly in response to GSH for achieving on-site cargo release.28−30 Several strategies have been reported on the synthesis of amphiphilic
block copolymer-based thiol-responsive degradable nanoparticulate
systems using the principle of molecular self-assembly. Basically,
micelle-like structures were generated from polymers either having
a disulfide bond in the middle of polymers31−33 or a disulfide
linkage as a side chain. These disulfides were cleaved in the presence
of GSH leading to the degradation of micelles and subsequent drug
release.34 In the present study, we tried
to develop GSH-responsive self-assembled NPs from the oxidized form
of the dipeptide cysteine-phenylalanine (CF). Oxidation of the free
−SH group leading to the formation of a disulfide linkage between
two dipeptide molecules occurred during the dipeptide synthesis using
the solution-phase peptide synthesis method. Oxidized cysteine-phenylalanine
(CFO) NPs generated after CF–CF covalent linking had two merits:
one is that they exhibited GSH-responsive behavior owing to the presence
of disulfide linkages, and second, the presence of free amine and
carboxylic groups made them amenable to be derivatized with a tumor-targeting
ligand like FA. Thus, the NPs had dual advantages of targeted delivery
along with site-specific GSH-triggered release of the loaded anticancer
drug inside the cancer cells. There are earlier reports highlighting
GSH-responsive drug delivery using NPs prepared from large molecules
such as homodithiacalix[4]arene (HDT-C4A), those with disulfide bridges,35 [Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OOC(CH2)nCH3)2], or prodrug
NPs.36 Cubic gel particles with GSH-triggered
drug release prepared by cross-linking of cyclodextrin metal–organic
frameworks have also been reported.37 Where
all these structures involve complex synthesis procedures, here, in
this study, we have synthesized NPs from a simple dipeptide, CF, and
explored their property for stimuli-responsive drug delivery. The
dipeptidic origin endows the particles with enhanced biocompatibility
than that of NPs prepared from large and complex molecules. Moreover,
these particles have dual advantages of targeted delivery along with
site-specific GSH triggering the release of the loaded anticancer
drug inside the cancer cells with a much improved safety profile.
Thus, to summarize, we investigated the potential of CFO NPs toward
cancer-targeting as well as GSH-triggered, redox-responsive drug release
behavior in glioma (C6) and melanoma (B16F10) cells.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of the Dipeptide
CF
was synthesized harnessing solution-phase peptide synthesis methods38 and purified using HPLC. The formation of disulfide
bonds was confirmed using a mass spectrometer. ESI MS (m/z): [M + H]+ calcd for C24H31N4O6S2+: 535.16; found: 535.07 (Figures S1 and S2). Further, the CFO peptide was characterized using 1H
NMR in CH3OD. Signals of 1H NMR (400 MHz, CH3OD): δ 2.63–2.81 (m, 4H), 3.00–3.06 (m,
4H), 3.16–3.21 (m, 2H), 3.30 (br, 2H), 4.62–4.65 (m,
2H), 7.18–7.45 (m, 10H) were observed (Figure S3).

Determination of the Formation of the Disulfide
Bond in CFO
One of the most important functions of thiols
is the formation
of disulfide bonds through an oxidation reaction. We assumed that
the dipeptide has undergone oxidation during the process of synthesis.
The formation and presence of disulfide bonds in the dipeptide were
validated by carrying out Ellman’s test. Ellman’s reagent
5,5′-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB) is used to determine
the presence of sulfhydryl groups in a molecule as it reacts with
the sulfhydryl groups to produce a colored product that can be quantified
by taking its absorbance at 412 nm.39,40 Ellman’s
test was carried out on CFO, which was expected to have a S–S
bond after oxidation.

The tripeptide GSH with a free −SH
group and Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH with a −SH group attached to a trityl
group were used as controls. As expected, tripeptide GSH with a free
SH group showed a peak at 412 nm, which was absent in the case of
CFO and Boc-Cys(trt)-OH indicating the absence of free SH–
groups in the CFO peptide (Figure 1). The formation of the disulfide bond between the
dipeptides was further confirmed using mass spectrometry where a corresponding
dimer peak was observed (Figures S1 and S2).

Figure 1 Graph showing the Ellman’s test UV–vis spectra of
cysteine-containing compounds. A peak at 412 nm indicates the presence
of a free −SH group.

The presence of a disulfide bond (S–S) in the CFO peptide
was also investigated using Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. Raman spectra
of CFO showed a characteristic peak belonging to the disulfide bond
at 540 cm–1. As expected, this peak was absent in
the GSH peptide, and a new peak at ∼2528 cm–1 was observed (Figure S4).41

Likewise, no absorption peak for free
−SH at 2520 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum was
observed for CFO (Figure S5). The FTIR
spectrum of the control
tripeptide, that is, GSH showed a clear characteristic peak for −SH
groups.42 These results clearly indicated
the formation of a disulfide bond in the CFO peptide.

Formation of
CFO NPs
After confirmation of the formation
of a disulfide linkage between the peptide, NP formation was achieved
by self-assembly of the peptide (CFO) in HFIP and water (Figure 2).

self-assembled NPs using oxidized Cys-Phe
(CFO) and their application in drug delivery.

Characterization of CFO NPs Using Different Techniques
Initial
characterization of CFO NPs was carried out using DLS to
measure the mean particle size of the NPs and their PDI to check particle
homogeneity. Light scattering studies demonstrated the formation of
monodispersed particles with a stable size of approximately 220 ±
21 nm and a PDI of 0.1 ± 0.03 after 120 min of incubation at
room temperature (Figure S6). SEM analysis
was carried out to gain insight into the morphological details of
the NPs. Results demonstrated that CFO self-assembled to form spherical
NPs with a mean particle size of approximately 201 ± 19 nm (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 Morphological analysis
of CFO particles carried out using (a) SEM,
(b) AFM, and (c) TEM.

Further, CFO NPs were
characterized using AFM and TEM (Figure 3b,c), and the results
of which supported SEM data by exhibiting the formation of spherical
particles.

GSH Responsiveness of CFO NPs
DLS
study was also carried
out to investigate the effect of GSH on the preformed NPs of CFO.
Results revealed that there was a significant difference in the mean
particle diameter and PDI of the NPs at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mM of the
GSH concentration (Figure 4). An increase in particle size and polydispersity was evident
as the GSH concentration was increased from 0 to 20 mM, suggesting
probable loosening of the tight and discrete particles formed in the
absence of GSH.

of
GSH on the mean particle size and PDI of CFO NPs. ***, **, and * represent
levels of significance (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively), and
ns represents the nonsignificant difference.

In order to investigate the effect of GSH on the particle surface
morphology and polydispersity, SEM analysis was carried out for CFO
particles incubated at different GSH concentrations (0, 5, 10, and
20 mM). As shown in Figure 5, CFO NPs were distorted as the concentration of GSH was increased
from 0 to 20 mM.

Figure 5 SEM images of CFO NPs taken at different GSH concentrations:
(a)
0, (b) 5, (c) 10, and (d) 20 mM. A significant change in the spherical
morphology of the CFO NPs was observed with particle distortion at
increasing GSH concentrations after 24 h of incubation.

Drug Encapsulation Study
Spherically shaped NPs can
act as excellent platforms for encapsulation of drug molecules. In
this study, we had tried to explore the potency of CFO NPs as carriers
for the anticancer drug Dox. DLS study demonstrated that the mean
hydrodynamic diameter of CFO NPs increased from 220 ± 21 nm to
306 ± 23 nm after being loaded with Dox (Figures S6 and S7). Further, the percentage encapsulation
of the drug was found to be almost 78.04% in the spherical particles,
which is comparable to the percentage loading obtained for various
therapeutic molecules in other dipeptide NPs like isoleucine-dehydrophenylalanine
(IΔF) and leucine-dehydrophenylalanine (LΔF) containing
the modified amino acid residue α,β,-dehydrophenylalanine.
LΔF NPs showed an entrapment efficiency of ∼40% for curcumin,
and NPs of IΔF demonstrated an encapsulation efficiency of ∼60%
for curcumin.43

Drug Release at Different
GSH Concentrations
The main
purpose of the study was to develop redox-responsive CFO nanocarriers
that are capable of differentially releasing the encapsulated drug
payload in response to varying GSH concentrations. Such a property
of any nanomaterial is highly desirable as these could have unprecedented
applications in the field of site-specific delivery in cancer cells.44,45 To investigate the release profile of Dox from CFO-Dox-NPs, a drug
release study for 24 h was carried out. It was observed that the increase
in the GSH concentration led to an enhanced release profile of the
anticancer drug from the cysteine-containing dipeptide NPs. The fastest
release rate was observed at 20 mM GSH as compared to that at lower
GSH concentrations (Figure 6). Similarly, GSH-triggered release of 6-mercaptopurine was
also obtained from folic acid-derivatized and GSH-responsive nanoparticles
generated from carboxymethyl chitosan.46

profile of Dox from CFO NPs carried out at different GSH
concentrations. Data represented as the mean of three (n = 3) independent experiments ± SD. The graph represents the
increment in the release rate of Dox with an increase in the GSH concentration.

Derivatization of CFO NPs with FA for Targeted
Delivery to Tumor
Tissues
FA receptors are overexpressed in many cancer cells.
FA is small and inexpensive and has high affinity toward its receptors
and has been used as a cancer-targeting ligand in many earlier studies.47 FA was conjugated to CFO NPs using the EDC/NHS
conjugation method. After conjugation, the underivatized FA molecules
were separated from those conjugated to CFO NPs by centrifuging the
sample at 14,000 rpm for 20 min.48 Conjugation
efficiency was determined by comparing the amount of free FA present
in the supernatant to the number of molecules present in the whole
sample before centrifugation and was found to be 95%. Further, the
characterization of FA-CFO-NPs was done using DLS, SEM, and AFM.

Characterization of FA-CFO-NPs and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs Using DLS,
SEM, and AFM
Initial characterization of FA-CFO-NPs was carried
out using DLS to measure their mean particle size and their PDI. Light
scattering studies demonstrated a mean particle size of approximately
359 ± 18 nm for the FA-CFO-NPs and a PDI of 0.42 ± 0.02
(Figure 7a). A change
in the mean particle size of FA-CFO-NPs to 359 ± 18 nm was observed
from 220 ± 21 nm for the nonconjugated ones. The observed increase
in the particle size of CFO NPs was in line with an earlier study
by Wang et al. wherein they derivatized PEG-GEM-NPs with FA and observed
an increment in particle size to approximately 184 ± 12 nm from
157 ± 7 nm.49

Figure 7 Morphological analysis
of FA-CFO-NPs carried out using (a) DLS,
(b) SEM, and (c) AFM.

Further, the morphological
study of FA-CFO-NPs was carried out
using SEM (Figure 7b) and AFM (Figure 7c). SEM results demonstrated that FA-CFO-NPs formed spherical NPs
with a mean particle size of approximately 261 ± 8 nm. AFM demonstrated
the formation of spherical particles with a size of 103 ± 9 nm (Figure 7c).
After the characterization of FA-conjugated CFO-NPs, Dox was encapsulated
in the FA-CFO-NPs, and the percentage encapsulation of Dox was calculated
to be almost 99.14% in the particles. Further, the Dox-loaded FA-CFO-NPs
(FA-CFO-Dox-NPs) were then characterized using DLS and SEM (Figure S8). Light scattering studies demonstrated
a mean particle size of approximately 365 ± 15 nm (Figure S8a) for the FA-CFO-Dox-NPs and a PDI
of 0.22 ± 0.01. Morphological studies of FA-CFO-Dox-NPs were
carried out using SEM (Figure S8b). SEM
results demonstrated that FA-CFO-NPs formed spherical NPs with a mean
particle size of approximately 361 ± 8 nm.

Drug Release
of FA-Conjugated CFO-NPs at Different GSH Concentrations
In order to investigate the release profile of Dox from FA-CFO-Dox-NPs,
the drug release study was carried out for a period of 24 h. As observed
in the case of free CFO nanostructures, FA-CFO-Dox-NPs exhibited an
upsurge in the release profile of the anticancer drug with an increase
in the GSH concentration. The release rate was substantially higher
at 20 mM GSH than that at lower GSH concentrations (Figure 8). Thus, folic acid conjugation
did not lead to any variation in the GSH-responsive behavior of the
CFO NPs. Such GSH-triggered release behavior of Dox from the NPs along
with cancer cell-specific targeting mediated by folic acid would,
therefore, ensure high and specific drug delivery only in cancer cells
completely sparing healthy cells.50

GSH concentrations. Data represented as the mean of three (n = 3) independent experiments ± SD.

The graph represents an increment in the release rate of

drug molecule with an increase in the GSH concentration.

Cellular
Uptake of CFO and FA-CFO NPs in C6 and B16F10 Cells
Derivatization
of NPs with FA as a targeting ligand is expected
to enhance their cellular uptake by facilitating the receptor-mediated
endocytosis process.51,52 C6 and B16F10 cell lines were
used to carry out the cellular uptake studies. These cells have been
shown to express higher levels of FA receptors.53−55 Confocal fluorescence
microscopic images demonstrated significantly higher fluorescent intensity
in the case of cells treated with Dox-loaded FA-CFO-NPs as compared
to CFO-Dox NPs and free Dox (Figure 9), suggesting enhanced particle uptake in C6 cells.
Quantitative analysis performed using Image J software also depicted
higher fluorescence intensity in the case of cells treated with Dox-loaded
FA-CFO-NPs as compared to cells treated with Dox-loaded CFO-NPs. C6
cells treated with Dox-loaded FA-CFO-NPs demonstrated approximately
2.55-fold higher fluorescence intensity, and CFO-Dox exhibited 1.65-fold
higher fluorescence intensity as compared to cells treated with free
Dox. These results clearly indicated higher cellular uptake of FA-CFO
NPs than that of CFO NPs. In order to validate the receptor-targeted
uptake by the FA-derivatized nanosystems, cellular uptake efficiency
of FA-CFO-Dox-NPs was carried out in a competitive uptake inhibition
assay. To do this, C6 cells were incubated with both free FA and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs.
Results demonstrated almost 3.55-fold reduction in fluorescence intensity
in the case of cells treated with FA-CFO-Dox NPs in the presence of
free FA as compared to those treated with FA-CFO-Dox-NPs alone. The
observed decrease in cellular uptake in the presence of FA is due
to the competitive binding of free FA with FA receptors.

Figure 9 Cellular uptake
of Dox-loaded, FA-conjugated CFO-NPs and nonconjugated
CFO-Dox NPs inside C6 cells. Intensity graph results show higher uptake
of Dox in the case of FA-conjugated CFO-NPs confirming targeted delivery.
***, **, and * represent levels of significance (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively).

Similar results were obtained in B16F10 cells (Figure 10) where Dox-loaded FA-CFO-Dox-NPs
demonstrated almost 1.91-fold higher fluorescence intensity as compared
to CFO-Dox and approximately 4.65-fold higher intensity as compared
to free Dox. However, when cells were incubated with FA-CFO-Dox NPs
in the presence of free FA in a competitive inhibition assay, a 7.16-fold
reduction in cellular uptake efficacy was obtained as compared to
the cells treated with only FA-CFO-Dox NPs. From the above results,
it is clear that the derivatization of CFO NPs with FA significantly
enhances the cellular uptake of derivatized NPs suggesting their possible
use in targeted delivery applications.38

Figure 10 Cellular uptake of Dox-loaded, FA-conjugated CFO-NPs and nonconjugated
CFO-Dox NPs inside B16F10 cells. Intensity graph results show higher
uptake of Dox in the case of FA-conjugated CFO-NPs confirming targeted
delivery. ***, **, and * represent levels of significance (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively).

To further confirm the targeting specificity of the FA-conjugated
NPs in FA receptor-positive cancer cells, the uptake of FA-conjugated
NPs was also determined in HEK293 cells (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Cellular uptake of Dox-loaded, FA-conjugated
CFO-NPs and nonconjugated
CFO-Dox NPs inside HEK 293 cells (nontumor cells).

Results demonstrated no significant difference in cellular
uptake
efficiency of FA-CFO-Dox-NPs versus CFO-Dox-NPs in HEK293 cells that
are negative for FA (receptor-negative) (nontumor cells). Thus, overall
it was observed that FA-CFO-Dox-NPs bound efficiently to FA receptors
and delivered the drug more efficiently into FA receptor-positive
cancer cells as compared to noncancerous HEK293 cells.

We also
performed uptake studies using rhodamine-encapsulated CFO-NPs.
Quantitative analysis performed using Image J software also depicted
higher fluorescence intensity and hence higher cellular uptake in
the case of cells treated with rhodamine loaded in FA-CFO-NPs as compared
to those cells treated with rhodamine loaded in CFO-NPs. C6 cells
treated with FA-CFO-NPs demonstrated approximately 1.2-fold higher
fluorescence intensity as compared to cells treated with CFO-rhodamine
and 2.15-fold higher fluorescence intensity in cells treated with
free rhodamine (Figure S9). Similar results
were obtained in B16F10 cells (Figure S10) where rhodamine-loaded FA-CFO-NPs demonstrated almost 1.82-fold
higher cellular fluorescence intensity as compared to CFO-Rhodamine
and approximately 2.65-fold higher intensity as compared to free Rhodamine.

In Vitro Efficacy Study Using C6 and B16F10 Cell Lines
It
is always necessary for any NP-based therapy that the cargo molecules
entrapped in the NPs must retain their activity. In order to check
this, the efficacy of Dox-loaded NPs was determined in cancer cell
lines, that is, melanoma cell line (B16F10) and glioma cell line (C6).
To begin this, we carried out cytotoxicity experiments using bare
NPs in C6 and B16F10 cells, which demonstrated approximately 95–96%
cell viability in both cell lines (Figure 12a,b) indicating the biocompatible nature
of the particles. Further, cells were incubated with CFO-Dox-NPs,
FA-CFO-Dox-NPs, and Dox suspensions (at concentrations of 2.5, 5,
10, 15, and 20 μg/mL) for a period of 24 h, and then cell viability
was determined using MTT assay. It was observed that the NPs exhibited
an increase in cytotoxicity and the highest killing in the case of
FA-CFO Dox-NPs as compared to other groups at all tested concentrations
in C6 cells. A similar study was carried out using the B16F10 cell
line (Figure 13a),
which further supported the efficacy results of the C6 cell line (Figure 13b). Further, IC50 values were calculated to determine the cell-killing efficacy
of the formulations.

Figure 12 Cytotoxicity of bare CFO-NPs and FA-CFO-NPs in (a) C6
cells and
(b) B16F10 cells.

Figure 13 Cytotoxicity of FA-CFO-Dox-NPs,
CFO-Dox-NPs, and Dox suspensions
toward (a) C6 and (b) B16F10 cells. Data reported as the mean of three
(n = 3) independent experiments ± SD. ***, **,
and * represents levels of significance (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively).

In C6 cells, free Dox demonstrated an IC50 value of
63.68 μg/mL, CFO-Dox-NPs exhibited an IC50 of 14.74
μg/mL, and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs exhibited an IC50 of 11.57
μg/mL. Thus, FA-CFO-Dox-NPs exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) higher efficacy in the cancer cells in comparison
to the native Dox suspension as well as Dox loaded in underivatized
NPs. In B16F10 cells, free Dox demonstrated an IC50 value
of 3.51 μg/mL, CFO-Dox-NPs exhibited an IC50 of 1.42
μg/mL, and Dox-loaded FA-CFO-NPs exhibited an IC50 of 0.94 μg/mL. The order of cytotoxicity against B16F10 cells
in terms of IC50 values revealed that FA-CFO-Dox-NPs had
significantly (P < 0.001) higher efficacy in comparison
to CFO-Dox-NPs and native Dox suspensions.

Enhanced cytotoxicity
of FA-CFO-Dox-NPs could be attributed to
their higher cellular uptake owing to their targeted delivery inside
cancer cells, which might have resulted in high drug payloads. Further,
expected triggered release of the drug in the cytoplasm of these cancer
cells (C6 and B16F10) due to the presence of higher GSH concentrations
(approximately 2–10 mM) can be an additional factor leading
to the observed enhanced efficacy. Similar work by Wei et al. reported
enhanced inhibition of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells
arbitrated by folate-targeted and 6-mercaptopurine-loaded, GSH-responsive
carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles.46 On a similar note, Dong and co-workers56 showed GSH-responsive BSA and FA-coupled mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs) for the targeted delivery of epirubicin (EPI). They demonstrated
specific intracellular uptake of the system in FA receptor-positive
HepG2 cells.56

Conclusions
In the present work, we have developed a novel disulfide bond-based
NP system through molecular self-assembly of a synthetic CF dipeptide.
The CFO NPs generating hereafter a covalently linked S–S bond
in CFO possessed two merits: first, they exhibited glutathione-responsive
behavior owing to the presence of disulfide linkages, and second,
the presence of free −N and −C terminal amine and carboxylic
groups endowed them the ability to be derivatized with the well-known
tumor-targeting ligand folic acid. Thus, the NPs had dual advantages
of being targeted to the cancer cells along with site-specific GSH-triggered
release of the loaded anticancer drug Dox, particularly inside the
cancer cells enriched with GSH. Evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity
of Dox-NPs showed remarkable cytotoxic effects on B16F10 cells and
C6 cells in response to high intracellular reducing potential in these
cancerous cells. Cellular uptake and intracellular release profiles
of these NPs confirmed that the NPs were taken up effectively and
they mainly released the encapsulated payload within cancer cells.
Folic acid-derivatized NPs exhibited enhanced cellular uptake in C6
and B16F10 cells (cancer cells) as compared to HEK293 cells (normal
and FA receptor-negative cells). Owing to their peptidic origin, the
dipeptide NPs reported here offer an added advantage of high biocompatibility.
Overall, the folic acid-derivatized and disulfide-based NPs may provide
a promising alternative as an anticancer drug-releasing platform for
facilitated targeting as well as on-demand drug release-pinpointing
cancer chemotherapy with a much improved safety profile, and this
study may also pave the path for designing other novel redox-sensitive
nanoplatforms for site-directed drug delivery.

reagent 5,5′-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB), doxorubicin
(HCl), ethyl acetate, methanol, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid,
and dichloromethane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany.

Cell Line and Media
C6 (glioma cell line), B16F10 (murine
melanoma cell line), and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were
procured from the National Centre for Cell Science Pune, India, and
further maintained in DMEM medium (Sigma, U.S.A.) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS), 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of
5% (v/v) CO2.

Methodology
Synthesis
of the Dipeptide (CF)
The dipeptide was synthesized
using solution-phase synthesis methods (Scheme S1).38 The disulfide linkage was
automatically formed during the synthesis of the dipeptide, and further
oxidation was done by purging O2 into the peptide for ensuring
complete oxidation. Further the peptide was characterized out using 1H NMR. The 1H spectrum was recorded on a 400 MHz
NMR spectrometers, and CH3OD was used as a solvent. The chemical shifts
are reported in parts per million considering the solvent as an internal
standard for 3H (δ 5.00 ppm). Signal patterns are indicated
as s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; m,
multiplet; bs, broad singlet; and bm, broad multiplet. Coupling constants
(J) are given in hertz (Hz).

Confirmation
of the Formation of the Disulfide Bond in Oxidized
Cys-Phe (CFO)
First, we carried out Ellman’s test
to check the formation of the disulfide bond. Ellman’s reagent,
5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), known as DTNB, is a water-soluble
compound used for quantifying free sulfhydryl groups in a solution.
DTNB reacts with free sulfhydryl groups to generate mixed disulfide
and a yellow colored product 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (NTB), which
can be quantified to determine the amount of free sulfhydryl groups.
Thus, a sample with a free −SH moiety will exhibit a characteristic
UV–vis spectrum with a peak at 412 nm. Therefore, the confirmation
of the disulfide bond formation in CFO was determined using Ellman’s
reaction. The tripeptide GSH with free −SH was taken as the
positive control, and Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH with a −SH group bound
to a trityl group was chosen as the negative control. First, DTNB
stock (1 M) solution was prepared in 50 mM sodium acetate. The working
solution (2 mM DTNB) was prepared using DTNB stock, Tris buffer (pH
8), and distilled water. Test samples were added to 60 μM the
working solution. Solutions were mixed properly, and absorbance was
taken at 412 nm.39,40

In addition, the formation
of the disulfide bond was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and
FTIR analysis. A confocal microRaman spectrometer, model HR800 (Horiba
Jobin Yvon, Bensheim, Germany), was used to check the disulfide bond
formation at room temperature. It uses a 532 nm laser line for the
confocal Raman study. Further, FTIR was performed using a Cary Agilent
660 IR spectrophotometer in the range of wavenumber 400–4000
cm–1.

Formation of CFO NPs
The formation
of self-assembled
NPs was achieved using 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa-fluoro-isopropanol (HFIP)
and distilled water. The dipeptide (1 mg/mL) was first dissolved in
HFIP (50 μL) and further diluted with distilled water (1 mL).
The resultant particulate suspension was incubated at room temperature
for at least 2 h to get a uniform assembly. The NPs were characterized
using dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Characterization of the NPs was carried out at a peptide concentration
of 1.86 mM (1 mg/mL).

Characterization of CFO-NPs Using Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS)
Particles were formed as mentioned
above and their polydispersity
index (PDI) and mean particle size was determined by using a DLS instrument
(Zetasizer Nano ZSP; Model ZEN5600; Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire,
U.K.). The responsiveness of the NPs toward different concentrations
of GSH was also determined using DLS studies.

Characterization
of CFO-NPs Using Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The morphology of the amino acid-based nanostructures
was determined by using SEM. Samples for SEM analysis were prepared
by drop-casting them on silicon wafers followed by air-drying. The
air-dried samples were gold-coated for 90 s in an auto fine coater
(JEOL JEC-3000FC). SEM analysis was further carried out to determine
the effect of different GSH concentrations on the NPs.

Characterization
of CFO-NPs Using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
AFM-based
studies of the particles were carried out using tapping-mode
atomic force microscopy using Bruker Nanoscope-V AFM having optimum
scanning frequency of approximately 1 Hz and with several pixels of
approximately 512. A cantilever with a length of 196 μm was
used for the study; the spring constant was chosen to be 0.06 (N·m)−1 to determine the surface morphology and roughness
of the self-assembled structures. Samples prepared through self-assembly
were drop-cast on a silicon chip and air-dried before imaging.

Characterization
of CFO-NPs Using Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
Further TEM-based studies were carried out with JEOL
TEM 2100 with a tungsten filament at an accelerating voltage of 120
kV. This study was carried out to determine the morphology of particles.
Particles prepared through self-assembly were suitably diluted with
Milli Q water and then drop cast on carbon-coated copper grids having
a mesh size of 200 nm and subsequently stained with uranyl acetate
(2% w/v) for imaging.

Drug Encapsulation Study
For drug
encapsulation, the
anticancer drug Dox was added to preformed NPs in an equal weight
ratio and further incubated for 48 h at room temperature with constant
shaking. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to separate
the unentrapped drug molecules. The concentration of the free drug
in the supernatant was quantified using UV–visible spectroscopy
at 480 nm. The drug encapsulation percentage was calculated by using
the following formula:

Percentage encapsulation = (Initial absorbance
of the drug solution – absorbance of the filtrate)/Initial
absorbance of the drug solution) × 100

Effect of GSH on the Pattern
of Dox Release from Dox-Loaded
CFO NPs (CFO-Dox-NPs)
Drug release studies were performed
using the dialysis bag method in dissolution solvent. Release behavior
of Dox from the NPs was monitored at different GSH concentrations
(0, 5, 10, and 20 mM) using a dialysis bag method (MWCO:12KDa). Samples
were kept under gentle stirring in the dissolution media at 37 °C.
At predetermined time intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24
h), 1 mL of the released solutions was taken out for testing and replenished
with the equivalent volume of the dissolution solvent. Drug release
kinetics was determined by sampling out 1 mL of the dissolution medium
at different time intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h),
and absorbance was measured at 480 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Japan).

Synthesis of NPs Derivatized with FA
NPs were prepared
as per the required amount and then conjugated with FA using 1-ethyl-3-EDC:NHS.
Using this method, the carboxylic group of FA (10 mM) was activated
with EDC:NHS (10 mM) and then incubated with NPs (1 mg/mL) at room
temperature for 18 h. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20
min, and then the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of distilled water.
Conjugation efficiency of FA with CFO-NPs was analyzed by measuring
the difference between the initial concentration of FA in the nanoformulation,
and the amount of FA remained attached to the CFO-NPs after being
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min.

Characterization of FA-CFO-NPs
and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs Using DLS,
SEM, and AFM
The initial characterization study of FA-CFO-NPs
and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs was done using DLS to measure their mean particle
diameter and PDI. Further morphology of the NPs was determined by
using JEOL SEM and Bruker Nanoscope-V AFM.

Cellular Uptake Study in
C6, B16F10, and HEK 293 Cell Lines
Using Confocal Microscopy
Cellular uptake studies of FA-conjugated
(FA-CFO-Dox-NPs) and nonconjugated NPs (CFO-Dox) loaded with Dox were
carried out in C6, B16F10, and HEK 293 cell lines. Inherent fluorescence
of Dox was used to visualize the cells in confocal microscopy. Cells
were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator up to
80% confluency. Cells were then treated with 50 μg/mL each formulation,
that is, free Dox, CFO-Dox-NPs, FA-CFO-Dox-NPs, and FA-CFO-Dox-NPs
in the presence of excess FA (FA-CFO-Dox-NPs + FA) (1 mM), for a period
of 24 h in order to determine competitive inhibition by free FA. After
the incubation period was over, confocal microscopic images were acquired
in the red channel using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880).

Further, cellular uptake studies of rhodamine-loaded FA-conjugated
NPs (FA-CFO-rhodamine) and nonconjugated NPs (CFO-rhodamine) was also
carried out in C6 and B16F10 cell lines as mentioned above.

Efficacy
Studies of FA-Conjugated CFO-Dox-NPs in C6 and B16F10
Cell Lines
Cells were plated (2 × 104 cells/well)
in triplicate in 96-well sterile microtiter plates and grown for 24
h allowing proper cell adhesion. Cells were then treated with free
Dox molecules, Dox loaded in CFO-NPs (CFO-Dox-NPs), Dox loaded in
FA-CFO NPs (FA-CFO-Dox-NPs), and void NPs and were incubated for a
period of 24 h. Cells were also treated with phosphate-buffered saline
as control. After an incubation period of 24 h, the media was removed
and replaced with 180 μL of fresh growth medium. Then, subsequently,
20 μL of MTT(5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to every well. The plate
was additionally incubated for a period of 4 h at 37 °C under
5% CO2. After completion of the incubation period, media
was removed and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added
to solubilize the formazan crystals, and absorbance was taken at 572
nm.

Statistical Analysis
Mean ± standard deviation
or mean ± standard error of the mean was calculated to express
the data. A T-test was used for drawing the comparison between different
groups. Differences between the mean values of five subgroups were
compared by one-way analysis of variance. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ***,
**, and * represent levels of significance (P <
0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05,
respectively).
