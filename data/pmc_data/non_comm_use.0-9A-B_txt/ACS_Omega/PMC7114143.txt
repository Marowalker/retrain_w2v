In
this paper, PVA/Ti3C2Tx mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared by mixing the
synthesized Ti3C2Tx with the PVA matrix, and the pervaporation (PV) performance of the
ethanol–water binary system was tested. The morphology, structural
properties, and surface characteristics of the membranes were investigated
by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, degree of swelling,
and water contact angle. The PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs exhibit excellent compatibility and
swelling resistance. Moreover the effects of the Ti3C2Tx filling level, feed concentration,
and operating temperature on the ethanol dehydration performance were
systematically studied. The results demonstrated that the separation
factor of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs was significantly increased because of Ti3C2Tx promoting the cross-linking
density of the membrane. Specifically, the membrane showed the best
PV performance when Ti3C2Tx loading was 3.0 wt %, achieving a separation factor of 2585
and a suitable total flux of 0.074 kg/m2 h for separating
93 wt % ethanol solution at 37 °C.

1 Introduction
Fuel ethanol,1,2 as a renewable bioliquid fuel
to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases, has been promoted and
used in many countries and regions around the world in recent years.
With the severe environmental pollution and the exhaustion of resources
such as petroleum, fuel ethanol has grown into one of the considerable
alternative energy sources. One of the main production technologies
of fuel ethanol is the biofermentation method,3 which produces 6–10 wt % ethanol and then obtains 95 wt %
industrial ethanol by distillation. To acquire absolute ethanol, particular
methods must be adopted. Different from traditional separation methods,
pervaporation (PV) technology4 breaks the
restriction of the vapor–liquid equilibrium and shows obvious
advantages in the separation of liquid mixtures of azeotrope or close
boiling compounds: energy conservation, environmental protection,
less space, and easy for industrial scale-up.5,6 The
industrial application of the PV process has been widely recognized
in organic solvent dehydration.7,8 Many hydrophilic polymer
membranes such as chitosan (CS),9 poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA),10 sodium alginate (SA),11 and so forth. have been investigated for the
ethanol–water binary system. PVA possesses extraordinary physicochemical
properties and can maintain its properties within long-term operation,
which is suitable for providing basic membrane materials for organic
solvent dehydration.12 In 1982, the German
GFT Company was the first to make breakthroughs in the industrial
application of PV, introducing commercial PVA/poly(acrylonitrile)
(PVA/PAN) composite membranes. However, a large number of OH groups
in the PVA molecular chain result in strong hydrophilicity. Untreated
PVA tends to swelling in aqueous solution, and the defects impair
the separation performance of the PVA membrane.13,14 The German GFT Company published the PV performance of the GFT commercial
membrane: for 80 wt % ethanol aqueous mixture of the feed liquid,
the separation factor was 100–200 and the total flux was 1.0
kg/m2 h at 80 °C. In addition, the separation factor
of the GFT-1510/2510 commercial membrane (95 wt % ethanol concentration)
was 258 and the corresponding total flux was 0.6 kg/m2 h.15 Although the pristine PVA membrane has achieved
industrial applications, its separation factor is still restricted.
In order to combat this, many modification methods such as cross-linking,16 grafting,17 and blending13 have been employed. Among them, doping two dimensional
(2D) materials,18 such as graphene,19 graphene oxide (GO),19,20 carbon nitride (C3N4),21,22 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),23 and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), has attracted the attention
of researchers.24 In the work of Wu et
al.,25 various UiO membranes were fabricated
by altering the organic linkers and doped in the PVA matrix for separation
of 90 wt % ethanol solution. The mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) displayed
obvious anti “trade-off” effects: for the UiO-66-(OH)2/PVA-1.0 MMM, the total flux and separation factor were increased
by 16 and 14%, respectively. Zhang and Wang26 fabricated PVA/ZIF-8-NH2 membranes for ethanol dehydration.
The MMMs exhibited enhanced PV performance, which was due to the increased
hydrophilicity of ZIF-8-NH2 with the PVA matrix. The total
flux and separation factor of PVA/ZIF-8-NH2 MMMs could
reach to 0.13 kg/m2 h and 201, respectively, at 40 °C.

2D materials27 with atomic thickness
and micrometer lateral dimensions have been widely used to develop
membranes with high separation performance. Moreover, they have mechanical
properties, thermal stability, excellent layered structure, and 2D
nanochannels, making the two-dimensional material separation membrane
have extraordinary permeability.28−30 As a new member of the
2D material family, transition metal carbides (MXenes) were discovered
by Gogotsi and Barsoum in 2011. MXenes31 have the formula Mn+1XnTx, where n is
1, 2, or 3, M is an early transition metal, X is C and/or N, and T
is the OH and/or O group. Among them, the formula of MAX phases (the
precursors of MXenes) is Mn+1AXn, where A stands for an A-group element (such as
Al and Si).32 One of the most representative
MAX materials is Ti3AlC2. Here, Al was extracted
from Ti3AlC231,33 and a two-dimensional
material called Ti3C2Tx Mxene was prepared. The hydrophilic, rigorous layered structures
and extremely short water molecule transport channel of Ti3C2Tx have attracted the attention
of researchers in the field of membrane separation.34−37 Liu et al.37 first prepared ultrathin Ti3C2Tx membranes for desalination by assembling
the Ti3C2Tx nanomaterial.
The selected Ti3C2Tx membrane showed high water flux and salt rejection. In addition,
this Ti3C2Tx assembly
membrane could maintain 100 h of PV desalination. Wu et al.38 fabricated 2 μm-thick MXene membranes
and applied it in ethanol dehydration. At room temperature and 5 wt
% H2O concentration, the total flux of the MXene membrane
was 263 g m–2 h–1 and the separation
factor was 135. At present, the Ti3C2Tx-based membrane has achieved some research results
in terms of water treatment and gas separation.39,40 Moreover, research studies on dehydration of organic solvents are
still in progress.

Herein, for the first time, 2D Ti3C2Tx was embedded in the PVA
matrix, and PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs was successfully
prepared. Various membranes were labeled PVA/Ti3C2Tx-0.0, PVA/Ti3C2Tx-0.5, PVA/Ti3C2Tx-1.0, PVA/Ti3C2Tx-2.0, PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0, and PVA/Ti3C2Tx-4.0. The structure and physicochemical
properties of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), water contact angle (WCA), and
degree of swelling (DS). In addition, the ethanol–water binary
system was used to evaluate the PV performance of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
The
SEM morphology and
EDS results of the Ti3C2Tx powder are shown in Figure 1. The lateral dimension of Ti3C2Tx was about 5 μm and showed a
typical stacked layered structure like “accordion”,
which enabled Ti3C2Tx advantageous for arranging 2D nanochannels in the PVA matrix.41 It can be seen from the results of EDS analysis
that Ti3C2Tx mainly
contained a large amount of Ti elements and C elements, and the presence
of small quantities of Al elements may be because HF did not completely
etch Al elements. In addition, 26.8 wt % of the O element and 9.5
wt % of the F element were observed, indicating that Ti3C2Tx contained a large amount
of oxygen functional groups, which was advantageous for improving
the hydrophilicity of the material.

Figure 1 SEM images (a) and EDS results (b–g)
of the Ti3C2Tx powder.

The surface and cross-sectional view of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs are shown
in Figure 2. As shown
in Figure 2a–f,
the surface
image of the pristine PVA membrane was smooth and flat. The PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMM surface with
slight fluctuations looked dense without any visible defects. It indicates
that Ti3C2Tx has
good compatibility with PVA, probably because of the interactions
between the oxygen functional groups of Ti3C2Tx and the PVA chain. In addition, it
can be seen from Figure 3a that the surface of PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM is loaded with Ti3C2Tx particles. Figure 2g–l showed the cross-sectional structure
of the membranes, and the thickness of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs was about 6 μm. Moreover,
the separation layer was firmly bonded on the PAN support layer.

3.0; and (f,l) 4.0 wt %.

Figure 3 EDS results of PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMMs: (a)
surface view and (b) cross-sectional structure.

The EDS diagram of surface morphology and cross-sectional structure
of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that Ti elements and F elements are substantially
uniformly distributed on the surface and cross section of the membrane,
indicating that the distribution of Ti3C2Tx in the PVA matrix is relatively uniform.
Among them, the gold element is distributed by spraying gold during
the sample preparation process.

To further research the surface
structure of the MMMs, topography
images and the surface roughness values of the MMMs were determined
with AFM (Figure 4).
The roughness values (Ra and Rq) of the membrane surface are shown in Table 1. The roughness increased with
the increase of Ti3C2Tx addition, which may be due to a higher Ti3C2Tx filling that leads to a larger
particle size with more chance of agglomeration on the membrane surface.

and (c) 3.0 wt %.

2.2 ATR-FTIR and XRD Patterns of the Membranes
The ATR-FTIR patterns of Ti3C2Tx powder, Ti3AlC2 powder, and
PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs
are shown in Figure 5. As can be seen from Figure 5a, Ti3AlC2 is substantially free of
any functional groups, whereas Ti3C2Tx mainly comprises OH groups and C–O–C
groups, which is consistent with previous articles.33 In Figure 5b, the broad absorption peak at 3267 cm–1 represented
the OH groups and the peak intensity of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs at 3267 cm–1 decreased with increasing Ti3C2Tx filling. The absorption bands at 1710 and 1234 cm–1 correspond to C=O and C–O groups, respectively.
Moreover, the characteristic peak formed at 1090 cm–1 was related to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–O–C
groups. According to a previous study,42 the cross-linking density of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs could be semi-quantitatively analyzed
by the FT-IR peak intensity of C–O–C groups (1090 cm–1) and OH group (3267 cm–1) ratio
(H1090/H3267). Table 2 demonstrated that the H1090/H3267 increased with increasing Ti3C2Tx filling. It further indicates that the cross-linking
density of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs is positively correlated with the amount of Ti3C2Tx filling. The ATR-FTIR
spectra showed that Ti3C2Tx promoted the cross-linking reaction of PVA, and Ti3C2Tx was well incorporated
into the PVA matrix.

PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs.

The Ti3AlC2 powder, Ti3C2Tx powder, and PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs were further
studied by
XRD. Figure 6a presented
the XRD patterns of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3AlC2 powders. Ti3C2Tx powders were transferred to
a lower angle at the (002) peak than Ti3AlC2, and Ti3C2Tx has
no strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 39°, which means that
most of the Al elements on Ti3AlC2 were etched
away and Ti3C2Tx was successfully synthesized. The same conclusion appeared in previous
reports.34,37 In Figure 6b, a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.7°
(d-spacing of 4.5 Å) was a typical lattice of
PVA, indicating that PVA is a semicrystalline polymer. The strong
diffraction peaks of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs at 2θ = 19.7° and 2θ = 8.4°
represented the main characteristic peaks of PVA and Ti3C2Tx, respectively. In addition,
with the increase of Ti3C2Tx filling, the peak intensity at 2θ = 8.4° increased
and the peak intensity at 2θ = 19.7° slightly decreased.

2.3 Hydrophilic and DS
The hydrophilicity
of the membrane surface is an essential property for PV. Figure 7 shows the WCAs of
different membranes. With the increase of Ti3C2Tx, the small decrease in contact angle
indicates that the hydrophilicity is enhanced. Although with the increase
of Ti3C2Tx addition,
the hydroxyl group is decreased, from Figure 4 and Table 1, we can see that the roughness is increased, and the
combination of the two factors resulted in a small decrease in the
contact angle.

Figure 7 WCA of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs with different amounts of Ti3C2Tx filling.

The DS of the experiment was tested in water, pure ethanol, and
93 wt % ethanol aqueous solution at constant temperature. The DS formula
is as the following equation 1  where WA and WB are the mass of the wet and dry membrane samples
(g), respectively. The DS of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs decreased with the increase of Ti3C2Tx filling, as shown
in Figure 8. The possible
reason can be described that the interaction between Ti3C2Tx and the PVA matrix increases
the cross-linking density of the membrane, which limits the movement
of PVA molecular chains. In addition, the decrease of hydrophilicity
of MMMs (Figure 7)
results in a decrease of affinity for water molecules.43 In general, Ti3C2Tx has good mechanical properties and swelling
resistance,44 so the addition of Ti3C2Tx inhibited the
swelling of the PVA membrane.

2.4 PV Performance for the Ethanol–Water
Binary System
The PV performance of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs for the ethanol–water
binary system was evaluated. Ti3C2Tx filling levels have a significant influence on the
separation performance of the membrane. First, the effect of Ti3C2Tx filling was studied
at 37 °C and 93 wt % ethanol concentration. The total flux of
PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs
decreased with increasing Ti3C2Tx filling, as shown in Figure 9a. We can explain that the crystallinity
of PVA membranes was not significantly improved (Figure 6) and the hydrophilicity of
the membrane surface was declined (Figure 7) from the preceding analysis, which makes
water molecules more difficult to enter the membranes. On the other
hand, the resistance of water components passing through the membrane
increases, attributed to the increase in the cross-linking density
and aggregation of Ti3C2Tx, so the water flux decreased. The total flux depends on the
water flux, so the total flux decreased. In addition, it can be seen
that the water content in the permeate of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx membranes exceeded 98.3 wt
%. According to Figure 9b, the optimum value of the separation factor was 2585 when the Ti3C2Tx filling was 3.0
wt %. Moreover, the separation factor increased when the Ti3C2Tx loading increased from
0.0 to 3.0 wt %, which may be owing to the enhanced cross-linking
density of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs, which led to the denser separation layer. The infrared
analysis and DS test side demonstrated that the cross-linking density
of the membrane increased after the addition of Ti3C2Tx. It showed that the addition
of Ti3C2Tx could
improve the separation factor of the PVA membrane. However, when the
amount of Ti3C2Tx filling exceeded 3.0 wt %, the separation factor decreased, which
may be due to the fact that Ti3C2Tx loading reached the saturation limit, and higher
than the concentration value, and agglomeration of Ti3C2Tx occured, resulting in defects
in the membrane.41,43Table 3 showed the effect of Ti3C2Tx loading on the permeability
and selectivity. Water permeability decreased with the increase of
loading amount of Ti3C2Tx, and ethanol permeability first decreased and then increased.
When the loading amount of Ti3C2Tx was 3.0 wt %, ethanol permeability was the lowest.
The PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0
MMM had the highest selectivity based on the change of water permeability
and ethanol permeability, and this was consistent with the variation
of the separation factor. The pervaporation separation index (PSI)
is defined as the product of the total flux and separation factor
and is used to characterize the PV performance of the membrane. PSI
reached the highest value when the Ti3C2Tx filling was 3.0 wt %. Herein, 3.0 wt % Ti3C2Tx was the best filling
amount for ethanol dehydration.

4.0	160.01	0.20	160.21	826.5	
Based on the optimal Ti3C2Tx filling, we evaluated the effect of ethanol concentration
in the feed liquid for the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM. The effect of the ethanol content in the
feed solution on the PV performance at 37 °C is shown in Figure 10. The water concentration
in the feed liquid directly affects the adsorption behavior of each
component on the membrane surface. As shown in Figure 10a, when the ethanol concentration in the
feed liquid increased from 87 to 97 wt %, the total flux decreased
from 0.11 to 0.03 kg/m2 h. This phenomenon was described
in early work.45 When the water content
in the feed decreases, the selective interaction between water molecules
and membranes decreases, which reduces the driving forces of the water
molecules. Furthermore, from the result of the DS of the MMMs (Figure 8), at higher ethanol
concentrations, the expansion degree of the membrane was less, which
reduced the free volume of the membrane. Therefore, the transport
resistance of ethanol and water molecules increases, resulting in
the decrease of total flux. It can be concluded from Figure 10b that the water flux was
much higher than the ethanol flux, and the trend was close to the
total flux, so the total flux was determined by the water flux. The
information presented in Figure 10a also included that the separation factor increased
from 654 to 4652 with the increase of ethanol concentration. This
is mainly due to the decreases in the DS of the membrane, which weakens
the chain movement of the polymer. Because of the large molecular
diameter of ethanol and the difficulty of passing ethanol through
the membrane, the adsorption selectivity of the membrane to water
increases, resulting in an increase in the separation factor. At different
feed concentrations, the water content in the permeate of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM exceeded
99 wt % (Figure 10a). The permeability and selectivity of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM at different ethanol
concentrations in the feed liquid, as shown in Table 4, water permeability, and ethanol permeability
increased with increasing ethanol concentration. The reason is that
the DS of the membrane decreased with a decrease in water content,
the free volume is reduced, and the diffusion of the components is
limited.25 In addition, the dissolution
degree of the membrane is decreased, and then, the driving force of
the molecules is reduced.39 It is worth
noting that the change in permeability is not significant, but the
selectivity is significantly increased.

The influence of operation
temperature on PV performance is special. Figure 11 showed the effect
of operating temperature on the PV performance of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs at 93 wt % ethanol
concentration. All of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs showed significant enhancement in the total
flux with increasing temperature, as shown in Figure 11a.46 We attribute
this phenomenon to two reasons: first, at high feed temperatures,
free diffusion of ethanol and water molecules intensifies, which increases
the free volume of molecules, and the activity of polymer segments
promotes the increase of DS. Second, the vapor pressure on the feed
side increases with increasing temperature, leading to an increase
in the mass transfer driving force of the membrane. Moreover, as seen
in Figure 11b, the
water flux and ethanol flux of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM both increased with increasing
temperature. Therefore, the total flux increased. The activation energies
of water and ethanol were obtained using the Arrhenius diagram (Figure 11c). The variation
of the permeation flux of each component follows the following equation 2  where J is each component
flux (kg/m2 h), J0 is the pre-exponential
factor, R is the gas constant (kJ/mol K), Ep is the activation energy (kJ/mol), and T is the temperature. The activation energy of ethanol and
water were 79.47 and 50.04 kJ/mol, respectively. The much higher ethanol
activation energy indicated the higher temperature sensitivity of
ethanol permeation over water permeation, and the ethanol flux tends
to increase faster than that of water when the feed temperature increased.
As shown in Figure 11d, the separation factor of all the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs decreased with increasing temperature,
which was similar to previously reported dense PV membranes.41,47 The reason was as follows: the free volume of molecules increases
with increasing feed temperature, the permeation resistance of the
ethanol molecules decreases, and furthermore, the penetration rate
of ethanol exceeds the penetration rate of water. The permeability
and selectivity of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM at different operating temperatures are
shown in Table 5. It
can be observed that the water permeability and the ethanol permeability
both increase with increasing temperature, and the increase in temperature
promotes the diffusion process of the components, indicating that
this is an endothermic process.48 It is
consistent with the trend of flux with temperature. The effect of
temperature on permeability was described by the Arrhenius formula
(eq 3) 3  where P is each component
permeability (106 g/m h kPa), P0 is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant
(J/mol K), Ea is the activation energy
(kJ/mol), and T is the temperature (K). Moreover,
the permeability activation energies of water and ethanol are listed
in Table 5. The smaller
the apparent activation energy, the smaller the energy barrier of
the molecule through the membrane,48 where EP,water is less than EP,ethanol, indicating that water permeability is more susceptible
to temperature changes. In addition, because water permeability and
ethanol permeability increase with increasing temperature, the selectivity
of the membrane is decreased.25 In addition,
the water content in permeate of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM exceeded 99.5 wt % at 37 °C.

Figure 12 investigates
the effect of operating time on the PV performance of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM. It can
be seen that during continuous dehydration of the PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM at 37 °C
and the 93 wt % ethanol–water binary mixture for about 7 days,
the permeate flux and separation factor are relatively stable. It
shows that the PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMM can operate stably for a long time.

Table 6 listed the
PV performance of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs for ethanol dehydration compared with reported membranes.21,26,43,49−56 As can be seen, the prepared PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs exhibited a higher separation factor
than most PVA-based membranes. It is indicated that loading Ti3C2Tx into polymer membranes
has prospects.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the novel two-dimensional material,
Ti3C2Tx, was used
as an inorganic
filler to prepare PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs. GA and PAN ultrafiltration membranes were used as cross-linking
agents and the support layer, respectively. The results showed that
Ti3C2Tx could be
uniformly dispersed in the PVA matrix, and they had excellent compatibility.
In addition, PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs exhibited excellent mechanical properties and swelling
resistance. PV performance results showed that loading Ti3C2Tx in the PVA matrix significantly
improved the separation factor of PVA membranes, but the total flux
of PVA membranes decreased because of the enhanced cross-linking density
and the weakened hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The PVA/Ti3C2Tx-3.0 MMM had the
best PV performance at 37 °C and 93 wt % ethanol solution, and
the separation factor was 2585, which was 17 times higher than that
of the pristine PVA membrane and with an acceptable permeation flux
of 0.074 kg/m2 h. When the concentration of ethanol decreased
and the feed temperature increased, the separation factor decreased
and the total flux increased significantly, which was consistent with
the typical regular of polymer membranes. The newly developed PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs have great
potential for membrane separation applications, which provide some
reference for the application of Ti3C2Tx in PV.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PVA-124 was purchased from
Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd. (Guangdong, China). Lithium fluoride (LiF,
>99.9%) was supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai,
China). Hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR) was from Beijing Chemical Works
(Beijing, China). Glutaraldehyde (GA, 50%) was obtained from Tianjin
Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute. (Tianjin, China). Glacial
acetic acid (HAc, AR) and ethanol (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

4.2 Synthesis
of Ti3C2Tx Powders
LiF and HCl were used as
milder etchants to replace HF, which were similar to previous research.31,33 The procedure was as follows: 1.98 g of LiF was slowly added to
6 M HCl solution (30 mL). After magnetic stirring for 1 h, 3 g of
Ti3AlC2 powder was slowly added to the solution,
and then, the mixture was held at 40 °C for 45 h and centrifuged
with deionized water until the supernatant reached neutrality. Then,
the black powder was dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for
1 h. Thereafter, the solution was centrifuged for 1 h to remove large
particles. After decantation, the black Ti3C2Tx colloidal supernatants were obtained
and dried in a vacuum oven.

4.3 Fabrication of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs
First, 8 g of PVA powders
was dissolved in 2 wt % HAc solution (92 g) and stirred for 1 h at
90 °C, and then, the insoluble large particles were filtered
off. An amount of Ti3C2Tx powder was dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for
1 h. Moreover, the abovementioned solutions were mixed and sonicated
for 0.5 h to form uniform dispersions. GA (2 wt %) was added as a
cross-linking agent to prepare the casting solution. Next, the casting
solution was degassed by vacuum and poured onto the PAN ultrafiltration
membranes, and solvents evaporate in a fume hood for 12 h. Finally,
PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs
were prepared by cross-linking for 2 h in an electric drying oven
at 90 °C.

4.4 Evaluation of the PV Performance
Test
The schematic diagram of the self-designed PV apparatus
is illustrated
in Figure 13. Among
them, the effective area of the membrane was 2.2 × 10–3 m2. The pump delivers the feed liquid to the membrane
cell. The vacuum on the permeate side is formed using a vacuum pump,
and the minimum absolute pressure can reach 0.2 kPa. The permeation
mixture was collected in the cold trap made of liquid nitrogen bath,
and the contents of upstream feed solution and downstream permeate
were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-14C, Japan).

Figure 13 Schematic
illustration of the PV evaluation apparatus.

The total flux (J) and separation factor (α)
were two key indicators of PV performances, which are defined as the
following equations 4   5  where J is the total flux
(kg/m2 h); Q is the weight of the permeation
component (g); A is the effective area of the membrane
(m2); t is the time (h); α represents
the separation factor; Y is the mass fraction of
components in the permeate liquid (wt %); X is the
mass fraction of components in the feed liquid (wt %); and i and j
stand for water and ethanol, respectively.

In addition, the
permeability (Pi)
and the selectivity (βP) are defined as eqs 6 and 7 6   7  where Pi is each
component permeability (106 g/m h kPa), Ji is each component flux (kg/m2 h), l is the thickness of the separation layer (m), x and y stand for the molar fractions of
the component in the feed liquid and the permeate liquid (%), respectively,
γi and Pis (kPa) are the activity coefficients
of feed mixtures and saturated vapor pressures obtained using Aspen
Plus software, PP is the permeate side
pressure (kPa), βP is the selectivity, and PW and PE are water
permeability and ethanol permeability (106 g/m h kPa),
respectively.

4.5 Characterization
The morphology of
powder and membranes was characterized by SEM (JSM7401F, Japan) and
EDS. AFM (SPA-400, Japan) was used to characterize the morphology
of membranes. The structural properties of PVA/Ti3C2Tx MMMs were studied with ATR-FTIR
(Bruker TENSOR 27). The diffraction patterns and crystalline phases
of membranes (remove the PAN ultrafiltration membrane) were researched
by XRD (Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Germany). The Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Tx powders
were also characterized. The hydrophilicity of membranes was experimented
by the WCA (Model PV-DP). The DS test was also performed.
