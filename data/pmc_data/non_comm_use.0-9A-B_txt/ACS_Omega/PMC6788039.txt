A convenient
access toward novel fluoroionophores based on 1-(2-pyridyl)-4-styrylpyrazoles
(PSPs) substituted at position 3 with donor or acceptor aryl groups
is reported. The synthesis proceeds in two steps: the first one via
Wittig olefination of the appropriate 4-formylpyrazole and then Mizoroki–Heck
coupling to yield the desired products in an overall yield of up to
69%. Photophysical properties of products (4-styryl) and their intermediates
(4-vinyl) were explored, finding that they have strong blue-light
emission with high quantum yields (up to 66%) due to ICT phenomena.
The 3-phenyl PSP was studied as a turn-off fluorescent probe in metal
ion sensing, finding a high selectivity to Hg2+ (LOD =
3.1 × 10–7 M) in a process that could be reversed
with ethylenediamine. The sensing mechanism and binding mode of the
ligand to Hg2+ were established by HRMS analysis and 1H NMR titration tests.

Introduction
Recently, the synthesis
of functional aza-heterocycles have attracted the attention of researchers
in the chemical, technological, environmental, and biological fields1,2 since their structural and electronic features favor the scope and
applicability of such compounds. For instance, pyrazoles receive great
interest due to their proved value in the preparation of diverse bioactive
compounds, coordination complexes, and organic materials.3,4 In particular, various functional π-extended pyrazole derivatives
have been photophysically studied displaying a strong blue-light emission
with high quantum yields;5,6 thus, these fluorophores
are increasingly recurrent in materials science mainly because their
high synthetic versatility allows them to modulate the electronic
properties.3−6 These features are strictly related to the nature of their heteroatoms
obviously by the effect of the π-extended substituents since
the pyrazole ring has a pyridine-type nitrogen atom (C=N, cation
receptor) and another pyrrole-type (electron donor) that favor charge-transfer
(CT) phenomena.3−7 Therefore, this important class of pyrazoles is already being used
in the design of fluorescent probes for ion sensing by altering their
π conjugation, which appears when chelation of metals or receiving
of anions occurs at the recognition sites (Figure 1).8,9

π-extended pyrazoles. (a) Fluorescent push–pull system,5 (b) cyanide detection probe,8 and (c) aluminum detection probe.9

The charge transfer (CT) processes
are frequent in fluorescent aza-heterocycles bearing diverse electron-donor
(D) and electron-acceptor (A) groups.1,2,10−12 These processes include internal
(or intramolecular) charge transfer (ICT),10 twisted internal charge transfer (TICT),11 and metal–ligand (or ligand–metal) charge transfer
(MLCT or LMCT).12 CT phenomena involving
metal ions can induce changes in fluorescent emission by chelation-enhanced
fluorescence (CHEF) or chelation-enhanced fluorescence quenching (CHEQ)
upon the chelation of a metal ion to the sensor molecule.1,9,12,13 Accordingly, the synthesis and design of fluorescent probes for
metals based on CT phenomena is an essential area of research due
to their proved utility in selective recognition of biologically or
environmentally relevant metal cations (i.e., Al3+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, etc.).9,11−17 For example, mercury (Hg) is one of the more severe environmental
pollutants and is extremely harmful to humans. The methyl mercury
yielded from the microbial biomethylation of Hg2+ is known
to cause brain damage and other chronic diseases;17,18 thus, research on rapid and sensitive analysis of mercury ions is
very needed.

Considering the important electronic properties
of pyrazole derivatives3−9 together with our interest in the synthesis and design of fluorescent
probes,11,14,19,20 we proposed the synthesis of 1-(2-pyridyl)-4-styrylpyrazoles
(PSPs) substituted at position 3 with donor or acceptor aryl groups
(3a–3c). These compounds are novel
π-extended bidentate trans-stilbene analogous21 ligands containing two pyridine-type nitrogen
atoms suitably located to achieve the formation of chelates. Consequently,
we have hypothesized that PSPs 3a–3c have the appropriate molecular architecture for their use in metal
ion sensing by fluorescence quenching based on LMCT phenomena.1,12,21 The synthesis of 3a–3c was optimized proceeding via two steps: first,
a Wittig olefination of the appropriate 4-formylpyrazole (1a–1c) to afford intermediates 4a–4c and second, a later Mizoroki–Heck reaction (Scheme 1a). We have already
reported about the preparation of the key precursors 4-formyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazoles 1a–1c to reach the ligands 3a–3c, starting from p-substituted
acetophenones (7) by a two-step sequence involving a
condensation with 2-pyridylhydrazine (8b) and then Vilsmeier–Haack
reactions (formylation and cyclization) on the respective hydrazone
(9a–9c) (see Scheme S2).19 In this case, a fluorescent
chemosensor (6c) for selective cyanide sensing could
be synthesized and designed from 1a–1c (Scheme 1b).19

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approach toward Fluorescent 4-Alkenylpyrazoles 3, 4, and 6
Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
Given our previous results
regarding the synthesis and photophysical application of the 4-dicyanovynylpyrazoles 6a–6c obtained from 4-formyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazoles 1a–1c, we pictured to expand the scope
of these results by the preparation of the novel π-extended
pyrazoles 6a–6c (Scheme 1). The synthesis of the aldehydes 1a–1c as well as of 4-formyl-1-phenylpyrazole 1d was carried out by our established method (see Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information).19 Reaction products from 1d cannot
be used for metal chelation but can work to set up initial conditions
in the synthesis of 6a–6c (1d is easier to access versus 1a–1c due to the disposition of the respective precursor hydrazine)
and as well as a reference for our later photophysical studies. With
the 4-formylpyrazoles 1a–1d in our
hands, we envisaged the Wittig reaction using benzyltriphenylphosphonium
bromide (2a) as a straight way to synthesize 4-styrylpyrazoles 3a–3d. Initially, we evaluated the synthesis
of the alkene 3d by the reaction of 2a with
the freshly synthesized aldehyde 1d and using n-BuLi-THF in accordance with that reported by Li et al.;22 however, the reaction afforded a mixture of
isomers (E)-3d and (Z)-3d with a very similar Rf in a 75% yield (Scheme 2 and Figures S1 and S2). It is noteworthy that very
few examples of 4-alkenylpyrazoles with substitution analogous to
that in pyrazoles 3 and 4 (Scheme 1a) have been reported in the
literature.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 4-Styrylpyrazoles (Z)-3d and (E)-3d
Reaction conditions: 1d (0.5 mmol), 2a (0.5 mmol), and n-BuLi
in hexane (0.2 mL, 2.5 M, 0.5 mmol) in THF (3.0 mL). The E:Z (∼1:3) ratio was determined by 1H NMR (CDCl3).

We continued our
study using methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (2b) under
similar conditions to those in which the mixture (E/Z)-3d was obtained in order to form the 4-vinylpyrazoles 4a–4d that would then allow access to
the desired products 3a–3d through
a Mizoroki–Heck reaction. The synthesis of 4a–4d was developed using an excess of 2b and n-BuLi with respect to 1a–1d, and except for 4a, 4-vinylpyrazoles 4b–4d were isolated in good yields, probably from
the low solubility in THF of their respective precursor 1a (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of 4-Vinylpyrazoles 4a–4d
Reaction conditions: 1a–1d (1.2 mmol), 2b (3.6 mmol), and n-BuLi/hexane (∼1.5 mL, 2.5 M, 3.6 mmol) in THF (14.0
mL).

Once 4-vinylpyrazoles 4a–4d were obtained, we stepped to set up the Mizoroki–Heck
coupling reaction to form products 3a–3d using the 4-vinylpyrazole 4d and testing the halobenzene
(different ratios of PhBr (5a) or PhI (5b) with respect to 4d), palladium catalyst (Pd(AcO)2 and PdCl2), phosphine ligand (PPh3 and
(oMePh)3P), and reaction solvent (dimethylformamide
(DMF), acetonitrile, water, and ethanol as highly polar solvents23). Likewise, the reactions were carried out under
microwave radiation (MW) in order to accelerate the study to settle
the best coupling conditions.3,10,11 Pleasantly and after several attempts, the desired (E)-1-phenyl-4-styrylpyrazol (3d) was afforded in an 85%
yield by using 10 mol % of Pd(AcO)2, 20 mol % (o-MePh)3P, ∼2 equiv of Et3N,
and 2.5 equiv of iodobenzene (5b) in DMF. However, when
the reaction was carried out with the 1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole 4b under the same conditions, a mixture of three products
was obtained possibly via Pd-substrate complexes (Scheme 4 and Figures S3–S5). NMR spectra data and MS analysis (Figures S3–S5) suggested that the mixture
could result from other coupling reactions favored by the pyridyl
group in the substrate.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 4-Styrylpyrazoles 3b and 3d,
Reaction conditions (A): 4b and 4d (0.4 mmol), 5b (1.0 mmol), Pd(AcO)2 (10 mol %), (o-MePh)3P (20 mol %), and Et3N (0.1 mL) in dry DMF (3.0
mL) under microwave irradiation.

Relative conversion (%) determined by 1H NMR
(CDCl3).

Consequently, we decided
to carry out the reaction conditions’ optimization to form
the desired PSPs 3a–3c starting from
the substrate 4b by making a slight variation in the
previous method in order to decrease or eliminate the formation of
collateral products (Table 1). Under the previously established conditions, 4b reacted completely (using only 2 equiv of PhI) but along with byproduct
formation (3b′ and 3b″, Scheme 4b), which decreased
under conventional heating (Table 1, entry 1 vs 2). More tests were made in order to evaluate
the effect of time and excess of iodobenzene (5b), concluding
that an increase in the reaction time favored the formation of product 3b, while with an excess of 5b, a greater formation
of byproducts was observed (Table 1, entries 3–5). Notably, the formation of the
desired product 3b was favored when Ph3P was
used as a ligand (Table 1, entries 1–5 vs 6 and 7). When using bromobenzene (5a) instead of 5b, a considerable decrease of
byproducts is found because of its lower reactivity, and the use of
MW heating led to a greater formation of 3b (Table 1, entries 8 and 9).
Finally, the catalyst effectiveness was evaluated when it is in greater
quantity and by the direct use of a Pd(0) catalyst; in both cases,
the 3b formation was inferior to that of the other tests
(Table 1, entries 10
and 11). Therefore, it was concluded that the best reaction condition
for the synthesis of 3b is entry 9 (Table 1).

Once the optimal reaction conditions

groups were successfully synthesized in good yields (Scheme 5).

(E)-4-styrylpyrazoles 3a–3d are shown.

Photophysical Properties
of 4a–4d and 3a–3d
The 4-alkenylpyrazoles 4a–4d and 3a–3d were photophysically
explored in order to establish their scope as fluorescent probes for
metal cation detection. The 1-(2-pyridyl)-4-vinylpyrazoles (PVPs) 4a–4c and PSPs 3a–3c are substituted at position 3 with different D or A groups
(i.e., a: 4-NO2Ph, b: Ph, and c: 4-MeOPh), while the N-phenylpyrazoles 4d and 3d were analyzed as reference in this
study (Figure 2). The
UV–vis and fluorescence emission spectra of 4 and 3 were recorded at room temperature (∼20 °C) in
solvents of different polarities such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
acetonitrile (ACN), ethanol (EtOH), dichloromethane (DCM), and toluene
(see Figures S6–S8 and Table S1 in
the Supporting Information). The maximum absorption bands for the
4-vinylpyrazoles 4a–4d are around
290–325 nm, which were attributed to π →
π* transitions. By comparing the maximum absorption bands between
PVPs 4a–4c, bathochromic shifts were
found in the following order 4c > 4b > 4a, indicating a greater charge transfer (CT) in 4c. The maximum absorption bands of 4b were compared with 4d in order to understand the effect of the 2-pyridyl group
on the electronic nature of PVPs 4a–4c where hypsochromic shifts were found at 4d versus 4b (Figure S6). This confirms that
the acceptor character of the 2-pyridyl group favors the D−π–A system and so increases the dipole moment in 4a–4c.19,24 In a similar
fashion to that of compounds 4a–4c, the PSPs 3a–3c showed the same
trend in the maximum absorption bands with bathochromic shifts in
the order 3c > 3b > 3a. The maximum absorption bands of 3d have also hypsochromic
shifts versus 3b due to the absence of the 2-pyridyl
group. In addition, the maximum absorption bands in 3a–3d have bathochromic shifts with respect to 4a–4d since the styryl group in 3 favors a higher π-conjugation than that of the vinyl
group in 4 (Figure S7).

Figure 2 Structure of
photophysically studied fluorophores 4a–4d and 3a–3d. Photographs
were taken using 20.0 × 10–6 M solutions of
each compound under a UV lamp (λex = 365 nm).

From the fluorescence emission spectra results,
it can be seen that pyrazoles 4a–4d and 3a–3d are fluorophores with
strong blue-light emission (quantum yields of up to 66%) in the range
of 350–400 nm (Table S1). The pyrazoles 3a–3d have a bathochromic shift versus
the derivatives 4a–4d due to the
π-conjugation effect mentioned above (Figure S8). The heterocycles with electron-withdrawing substituents
such as the NO2 group in pyrazoles 4a and 3a are characterized by having lower fluorescence emission
than that of the rest of the pyrazoles due to an efficient crossing
process between systems carried out by the existence of a low-energy
transition n → π*. This phenomenon is
the result of a high internal conversion rate of S1 → S0 that
may be related to the high CT in the excited state to the NO2 group since this substituent has a strong electron-withdrawing character.
Likewise, the N-phenylpyrazoles 4d and 3d have lower quantum yields compared with the N-(2-pyridyl)pyrazoles 4b and 4c and 3b and 3c, indicating that the 2-pyridyl group
of these ligands has a great influence on the fluorescence emission
favoring ICT phenomena. In contrast to fluorescent compounds 4c and 3c, the 4-formylpyrazole 1c does not fluoresce due to a similar internal conversion phenomenon
to that occurring in nitrocompounds (Figure S8d). In this way, it can be concluded that pyrazoles must be functionalized
with vinyl or styryl groups to increase their π-conjugation
in order to render novel fluorophores.

Furthermore, the quantum
yields in compounds 4a–4d and 3a–3d are dependent on the solvent polarity.
The values reveal high dependence on solvent properties such as hydrogen-bonding
donor ability and polarizability (Table S1). The quantum yields for most compounds were higher in ethanol (polar
protic solvent), which may be due to a negative solvatokinetic phenomenon.25−27 A solvatokinetic effect occurs when the quantum yield of fluorescence
of a compound shows a slight variation with the change in the polarity
of the solvent. In this effect, the quantum yield increases with an
adequate improvement of the ICT that involves the configuration of
the electronic n → π transition, while
the reduction in the quantum yield due to a strong ICT is called a
positive solvatokinetic effect.25−27

Subsequently, we evaluated
the effect of water on the fluorescence emission of 3b (Ph) using EtOH:H2O mixtures due to its high performance
in ethanol, although 3c (4-MeOPh) has a slightly higher
quantum yield in ethanol (Table S1); however,
the phenyl group of 3b is not affected with this protic
mixture by not partaking in hydrogen bonding.11 In this experiment, it can be observed that a higher water percentage
leads to a decrease of the fluorescence emission intensity (Figure 3). Only a range of
0–20% of water constant tendency in the emission
of fluorescence is maintained. In the next step, cation detection
studies in ethanol were performed, and the percentage of water should
not exceed 20% in order for it not to interfere in the analysis quantification.
Thus, compound 3b was used in further studies toward
the design of a fluorescent probe for metal sensing in an EtOH:H2O mixture (9:1 v/v, pH = 7.14 at 20 °C).

(b) Integral of the respective fluorescence emission curves vs water
percentage.

Fluorescence and UV–vis Response of
Ligand 3b to Metal Ions
To evaluate the use
of the PSP 3b in the metal ion detection, UV–vis
spectra of 3b (4.0 × 10–6 M) were
measured in the presence of alkaline (Na+ and K+), alkaline earth (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+), and heavy metals (Cr3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Al3+, and Pb2+) in EtOH:H2O (9:1). After the addition of a high cation excess (4.0 ×
10–4 M, 100 equiv), we observed slight spectral
changes of a hypsochromic shift (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, and
Cd2+) and a hyperchromic type (Cr3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and
Pb2+) suggesting that 3b may be interacting
with these metals (Figure S9). Additionally,
a strong hyperchromic effect in the band around 250 nm was observed
in the presence of Hg2+ that can be associated with 3b:metal interaction but could also be due to the absorbance
of Hg2+ itself around 270 nm.28 To understand the response in fluorescence emission from 3b (1.0 × 10–6 M) toward the metal ions evaluated
by absorption spectroscopy, emission spectra of 3b were
measured using a high concentration (1.0 × 10–4 M, 100 equiv) of the different cations (λex = 320
nm), achieving EtOH:H2O (∼9:1) final solutions (Figure 4). Under these conditions,
only the presence of Hg2+ induced notable fluorescence
quenching, while with other metal ions, there was some change in the
emission intensity versus the free ligand 3b, or an increase
in fluorescence emission was observed in a nonselective manner (Figure 4). For example, Ba2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, and Al3+ showed to some extent
an increase in intensity compared to 3b. However, this
change in the fluorescence emission signal does not allow us to selectively
identify the chemosensor response in the presence of these cations.

Figure 4 (a) Fluorescence
spectra of 3b (1.0 × 10–6 M in
EtOH:H2O, 9:1 v/v at 20 °C) in the presence of various
metal ions (1.0 × 10–4 M, 100 equiv, λex = 320 nm). (b) Fluorescence intensity response of 3b to Hg2+ and other metals (λem = 390 nm). The photograph was taken under a UV lamp (λex = 365 nm).

These results suggest
that the ligand 3b could only be a good fluorescence
chemosensor for Hg2+. Next, we analyzed the preferential
selectivity of 3b as a fluorescent chemosensor for Hg2+ detection in the presence of several competing ions for
which the ligand 3b (2.5 × 10–6 M in EtOH:H2O, 9:1 v/v) was treated with Hg2+ in the presence of other metal ions (2.5 × 10–4 M, 100 equiv). From these results, it can be observed that the interference
for Hg2+ sensing when Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Al3+, and
Pb2+ are present is relatively low; thus, the probe 3b could be used for Hg2+ sensing in the presence
of these competing ions, which could appear in real samples (Figure 5).

Figure 5 (a) Fluorescence spectra
of 3b (2.5 × 10–6 M in EtOH:H2O, 9:1 v/v) at 20 °C (λex = 320 nm)
in the presence of Hg2+ (2.5 × 10–4) and of different metallic ions (2.5 × 10–4). (b) Maximum fluorescence intensity of 3b in these
experiments (values were at λem = 390 nm).

Measurements of fluorescence emission of 3b after an increase in the concentration of Hg2+showed that the fluorescence is completely turned off after the addition
of 200 equiv of Hg2+. Additionally, a linear range between
0.5 × 10–6 and 4.5 × 10–6 M with a calculated limit of detection (LOD) of 3.1 × 10–7 M (R2 = 0.9950) was observed
(Figure 6a–c),
meaning that this probe is able to detect approximately 6.2 ×
10–5 g of Hg2+ in 1 L of dissolution
(62 ppb). The value of the LOD is higher than the permitted level
in drinking water according to the EPA standard in the United States
(2 ppb, 2.0 × 10–6 g/L)29 and to the amount allowed in accordance with Resolution
2115 of 2007 of the Ministry of Environment of the Government of Colombia
(1.0 × 10–6 g/L).30 However, the LOD calculated in this work is a value that is in the
same order of magnitude compared with other chemosensors recently
reported in the literature.31−33 In order to determine the stoichiometry
of the complex, the Job’s plot study of the fluorescence emission
for 3b–Hg2+ interaction was made. This
curve showed a maximum around 0.3 indicating the formation of complex 3b:Hg2+ with a molar ratio that can be between
2:1 and 3:1 (Figure 6).

in EtOH:H2O (9:1 v/v) showing a stoichiometry of ∼2:1
(λex = 320 nm).

Additionally, it was found that the interaction of probe 3b with Hg2+ is reversible after having added ethylenediamine.
In this way, two tests were carried out in which the minimum necessary
amount of diamine to recover the fluorescence emission of 3b was evaluated after turn-off with Hg2+ (Figure 7). In the first testing, an
excess of Hg2+ was added (Figure 7a and Table 2) where twice of the ethylenediamine molar ratio was
required to recover the initial fluorescence emission of 3b. In the second testing, a greater amount of Hg2+ was
added, and three times of the diamine molar ratio was needed to get
back the initial fluorescence emission of 3b (Figure 7b and Table 2). This study confirms that
fluorescence quenching is effectively due to the interaction of the
PSP 3b with Hg2+ and not any external agent.
In this case, the turn-on fluorescence is a result of the high affinity
of ethylenediamine toward Hg2+ (Ka = 2.0 × 1014 L/mol at 25 °C),34,35 which resulted in the 3b:Hg2+ complex dissociation
and releasing of the fluorophore 3b. Consequently, ligands
having the 1-(2-pyridyl)-4-styrylpyrazolic moiety could be good fluorescent
probe models for Hg2+ sensing, so we expected to extend
our research toward a possible use in real samples and including more
analytical details.

Proposed Sensing Mechanism
of 3b toward Hg2+
A plausible mechanism
for Hg2+ detection using the probe 3b based
on the above experimental results is proposed. In addition, 1H NMR titration experiments and HRMS analysis were employed to corroborate
this mechanism and understand the binding mode of ligand 3b to Hg2+ (Figure 8 and Figure S10). The titration
was made in DMSO-d6 using a constant amount
of ligand and gradually increasing the concentration of Hg2+ (a CHCl3 trace was used as a reference). The increase
of the Hg2+ ratio provokes the corresponding signals to
the pyridinic (H1–H4, green) and pyrazolic (H5,
red) protons to be shifted downfield. In contrast to those, the characteristic
signals of the alkenyl (H6–H7, blue) and phenyl
groups (gray) protons are remained almost unchanged. These results
suggest that both pyridinic and pyrazolic nitrogen atoms participate
in the coordination of 3b with Hg2+ (Figure 8).

Figure 8 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) titration of 3b with an increase
in the molar ratio of Hg(NO3)2 vs 3b at 20 °C.

Finally, the high-resolution
mass spectrum (Figure S10) using electrospray
ionization (HRMS-ESI) was recorded for the complex formed in situ
between 3b and Hg(NO3)2·H2O in MeOH:H2O (1:1 v/v), which led to a quick fluorescence
quenching. An ion peak at m/z =
865.2595 is found, which corresponds to the mass of the complex [2 3b:HgOH]+ (calculated, 865.2573). This result agrees
with the formation of a 3b:Hg2+ complex with
a molar ratio of ∼2:1 previously found by the Job method (Figure 6d). To corroborate
that, the peak at m/z = 865.2595
corresponds to the mass of the complex [2 3b:HgOH]+ detected by HRMS. The isotopic distribution of the experimental
mass spectrum was compared with that calculated resulting in a perfect
match (Figure S10).36

With all the above results about 3b in
metal probe designing and based on reported metal cation chemosensors,9,12−18 we finally describe the proposed sensing mechanism of 3b toward Hg2+. In this way, upon addition of Hg2+ to dissolution of the bidentate ligand 3b, fluorescence
quenching is observed as a result of the coordination 2 3b:Hg2+, which promotes a ligand-to-metal charge transfer
(LMCT) process in the excited state. This interaction provides a pathway
for the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state that manifests
itself in the quenching of the fluorescence emission.37,38 The sensing mechanism and the reversibility process through the
complex 2 3b:Hg2+ are shown in Scheme 6.

Conclusions
In
summary, both the 4-vinyl- and 4-styryl-pyrazoles substituted at position
3 with donor or acceptor groups were sequentially produced in good
yields by Wittig olefination (from 4-formylpyrazoles) and then using
the Mizoroki–Heck coupling reaction. These π-extended
pyrazoles were characterized by spectroscopic and HRMS analysis, which
allowed us to find that they are key fluorophores with strong blue-light
emission and high quantum yields due to ICT phenomena. The presence
of the styrene moiety in product 3 increases the π-conjugation
inducing bathochromic shifts in both the UV–vis and fluorescence
spectra. The ligand 3b was evaluated as a “turn-off”
fluorescent probe for Hg2+ detection since its structure
has two donor N atoms at pyridine and pyrazole rings suitably located
to achieve the formation of chelates. The results showed a selective
detection of Hg2+ versus other cations (LOD = 3.1 ×
10–7 M, R2 = 0.995).
Photophysical and HRMS analysis and 1H NMR titration experiments
confirmed the formation of the complex 2 3b:Hg2+ with stoichiometry of 2:1. Reversibility studies confirmed the reignition
of the probe 3b after adding ethylenediamine, indicating
that the interaction of 3b with Hg2+ is the
direct cause of the fluorescence dulling and not external agents.
Therefore, the 4-styrylpyrazoles 3a–3c or even their precursors 4a–4c appear
to be good models for designing novel fluorescent probes in metal
ion detection.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further purification unless otherwise noted. All starting materials
were weighed and handled in air at room temperature. The reactions
were monitored by TLC visualized by a UV lamp (254 or 365 nm), which
were performed on Merck TLC-plates aluminum silica gel 60 F254. Column and flash chromatography were performed on silica gel (70–230-mesh
and 230–400-mesh, respectively). All reactions under MW irradiation
were performed using a sealed reaction vessel (10 mL, max pressure
= 300 psi) containing a Teflon-coated stirring bar (obtained from
CEM). MW-assisted reactions were performed in a CEM Discover focused
microwave (ν = 2.45 GHz) reactor equipped with a built-in pressure
measurement sensor and a vertically focused IR temperature sensor;
controlled temperature, power, and time settings were used for all
reactions. NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz (1H) and
100 MHz (13C) at 298 K. NMR spectroscopic data were recorded
in CDCl3 using as internal standards the residual nondeuteriated
signal for 1H NMR and the deuteriated solvent signal for 13C NMR spectroscopy. DEPT spectra were used for the assignment
of the carbon-type signals. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in
parts per million, and coupling constants (J) are
given in Hertz. The following abbreviations are used for multiplicities:
s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, and m = multiplet. Melting
points were collected using a capillary melting point apparatus and
are uncorrected. HPLC–high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) data
were recorded using a Q-TOF spectrometer via electrospray ionization
(ESI, 4000 V). The mass spectrum of the byproduct 3b″ (Figure S5) was recorded using a DSQ
II spectrometer (equipped with a direct inlet probe) operating at
70 eV. Noncommercially available 4-formylpyrazoles 1a–1d were prepared using our established protocol
(see Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information).19 The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission
spectra were recorded in quartz cuvettes having a path length of 1
cm. UV–vis and fluorescence measurements were performed at
room temperature (∼20 °C). For fluorescence measurements,
both the excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm.

Chemosensor Design
UV–Vis Absorption and Fluorescence
Studies
The solvochromic studies of 3a–3d and 4a–4d were carried
out from 2.0 × 10–4 M stock solutions in toluene,
DCM, ACN, DMSO, and EtOH. UV–vis spectra were recorded at 1.0
× 10–5 M and fluorescence spectra were recorded
using different concentrations (10.0, 5.0, 2.5, and 1.0 × 10–6 M) and the respective maximum absorption wavelength.

Determination of the Relative Quantum Yields
The relative
quantum yields of 3a–3d and 4a–4d were determined by using quinine
sulfate (φF = 0.59 in 1.5 × 10–1 M HClO4) as reference and calculated according to the
following equation.39−41  where x and st indicate the sample and standard solution, respectively,
φ is the quantum yield, F is the integrated
area of the emission, A is the absorbance at the
excitation wavelength, and η is the index of refraction of the
solvents.

Response of the PSP 3b to Metal
Ions
Initially, this study was carried out from solutions
of 3b in EtOH:H2O (9:1 v/v, pH = 7.14 at 20
°C) 1.0 × 10–6 M (fluorescence) and 4.0
× 10–6 M (absorbance). Salts used in stock
solutions of metal ions were NaCl, KNO3, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, CaCl2, Ba(NO3)2, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, CdCl2, Hg(NO3)2·H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and Pb(NO3)2. These salts were dissolved in deionized water to afford
the respective aqueous solutions (1.0 × 10–3 M). In the selectivity and competition experiments of 3b toward Hg2+ and other metal ions, the fluorescence emission
spectra were recorded at λex = 320 nm from 1.0 ×
10–6 M of 3b in the presence of a high
concentration (100 equiv) of different metal ions, achieving EtOH:H2O final solutions (∼9:1 v/v at 20 °C). Solutions
were stirred and waited for 20 min before taking the respective measurements,
but the response was immediate when using Hg2+ (fluorescence
quenching observed under a UV lamp). The sensing studies were performed
at pH 7.14 because it is close to the physiological pH (approximately
7–7.4). The fluorescence intensities were measured at λem = 390 nm. For the Job’s plot experiment of 3b and Hg2+, the total concentrations of 3b and Hg2+ were kept as 1.0 × 10–6 M. The fluorescence response in pictures was excited at 365 nm using
a handheld UV lamp.

Determination of the Detection Limit
The detection limit (LOD) of 3b for Hg2+ was
obtained by 3Sb/k where Sb is the standard deviation of the blank measurements
(by 10 times, Sb = 0.8527) and k is the slope from the plot fluorescence intensity I versus [Hg2+].42,43

Reversible
Study with Ethylenediamine
Once there was quenching fluorescence
of 3b (2.0 × 10–6 M in EtOH:H2O, 9:1 v/v) with the respective quantity of Hg2+, the fluorescence emission spectra (λexc = 320
nm at 20 °C) were recorded upon addition of different quantities
of ethylenediamine dissolved in EtOH:H2O (9:1 v/v). For
a turn-off 1:100 (3b:Hg2+) solution, molar
ratios from 1 to 3 of diamine with respect to Hg2+ were
used to achieve a fluorescence turn-on, while for a 1:200 (3b:Hg2+) solution, molar ratios from 2 to 6 of diamine versus
Hg2+ were used.
