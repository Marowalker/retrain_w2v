Here,
we report a facile and easily scalable hydrothermal synthetic
strategy to synthesize Ni–V layered double hydroxide (NiV LDH)
nanosheets toward high-energy and high-power-density supercapacitor
applications. NiV LDH nanosheets with varying Ni-to-V ratios were
prepared. Three-dimensional curved nanosheets of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH showed better electrochemical performance compared
to other synthesized NiV LDHs. The electrode coated with Ni0.80V0.20 LDH nanosheets in a three-electrode cell configuration
showed excellent pseudocapacitive behavior, having a high specific
capacity of 711 C g–1 (1581 F g–1) at a current density of 1 A g–1 in 2 M KOH. The
material showed an excellent rate capability and retained the high
specific capacity of 549 C g–1 (1220 F g–1) at a current density of 10 A g–1 and low internal
resistances. Owing to its superior performance, Ni0.80V0.20 LDH nanosheets were used as positive electrode and commercial
activated carbon was used as negative electrode for constructing a
hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device, having a working voltage of 1.5
V. The HSC device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 98 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1. The HSC device showed a higher energy density of 30.6 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 0.78 kW kg–1 and maintained a high value of 24 Wh kg–1 when
the power density was increased to 11.1 kW kg–1.
The performance of NiV LDHs nanosheets indicates their great potential
as low-cost electrode material for future energy-storage devices.

1 Introduction
Due
to global economy development, the continuous upsurge in demand
of energy gives rise to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels,
which eventually has resulted in lessening of fossil fuels, environmental
pollution, and global warming.1,2 To safeguard the environment
from adverse impacts and meet the future energy demand, electricity
generated through clean route has gained increased attention, which
is one of the major thrust areas in renewable energy.3,4 Supercapacitors, also known as ultracapacitors, are one of the safe
and attractive energy-storage devices over batteries and conventional
capacitors due to their higher power density than batteries and higher
energy density compared to conventional dielectric capacitors.5 On the basis of charge-storage mechanisms, supercapacitors
are classified as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.6 In EDLCs, charge is stored due to electrostatic
attraction between electrolyte ions at the electrode–electrolyte
interface; however, charge-storage mechanism follows a Faradic reaction,
i.e., charge storage takes place at the surface of active electrode
material in pseudocapacitors.7 Pseudocapacitors,
due to their higher energy density and specific capacitance compared
to EDLCs, are more attractive candidates for future energy-storage
devices.8 Transition-metal oxides like
Co3O4,9 MnO2,10 RuO2,11 TiO2,12 NiO,13 Fe2O3,14 and Nb2O5;15 conducting polymers,16,17 for example, polyaniline, polypyrrole,
and polythiophene; and Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles18,19 have been used in pseudocapacitors because of their superior energy
density, fast redox behavior, high specific capacitance, and environment-friendly
nature. Ternary metal oxides having formula AXB3–XO4, where A and
B are transition metals with spinel structures, like NiCo2O4,20,21 CoFe2O4,22 NiMn2O4,23 MnCo2O4,24 CuCo2O4,25 etc., have shown outstanding supercapacitive performance and excellent
stability during cycling compared to their respective metal oxides
mainly due to their superior electronic conductivity.26

Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDHs) materials
have gained
popularity as favorable electrode materials for supercapacitors owing
to their high capacitance, distinctive structural properties having
high surface area, fast redox reaction during charging and discharging,
flexible ion exchangeability, environment-friendly nature, and cost-effective
scalability.27 LDHs are originally inorganic
claylike materials having two-dimensional morphology with highly tunable
hydrotalcite-like layered structure.28 LDHs
contain positively charged metal hydroxide layers and weakly bonded
charge-balancing anions and intercalating water molecules.29 These are represented by the general formula
[M(1–X)2+M(X)3+(OH)2]X+[An–]X/n·mH2O,
where M2+ and M3+ are the divalent (i.e., Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+) and
trivalent (i.e., Fe3+, Al3+, Mn3+) metal cations and An– are the
anions, i.e., OH–, SO42–, CO32–, NO3–, Cl–, or F–. In LDHs, water
molecules are hosted in between the cationic layers as neutral molecule
and hydrogen-bonded with cationic layers.30,31 The value of X in LDHs crystal structure generally
varies from 0.25 to 0.33, providing the composition tunability of
LDHs.32

It is worth noting from the
literature that LDH materials have
been considered as supercapacitive materials due to their resemblance
of charge-storing mechanism and high power density. Brousse and co-workers
showed that their charge–discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV)
profiles are different from those of pure pseudocapacitive materials,
i.e., MnO2, RuO2.33−35 Thus, LDH materials
should be considered as battery-like materials. NiCo LDHs have attracted
significant attention because of good performance as an electrode
material (790 C g–1 at 2 A g–1).36 Chen and co-authors reported a specific
capacitance of 2498 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 current density for nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon/NiCo LDHs composite.37 Wang et al. achieved a specific capacitance
of 2762 F g–1 (1243 C g–1) at
a current density of 1 A g–1.38 CoAl LDH/graphene composites have achieved a specific capacitance
of 479 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.39 Bai et al. reported carbon nanotube/NiAl
LDH composites and showed a specific capacitance of 694 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.40 Atomically thin NiFe LDH three-dimensional (3D) microspheres
showed a specific capacitance of 1061 F g–1 at a
current density of 1 A g–1.41 Lv et al. reported glucose-interclated NiMn LDH materials and showed
a specific capacitance of 1464 F g–1 at a current
density of 0.5 A g–1, whereas pristine NiMn LDH
showed only 852 F g–1.42 MgAl LDH/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite showed a specific
capacitance of 1334 F g–1 at a current density of
1 A g–1.43 To the best
of our knowledge, there is no study available over hydrothermally
tailored nickel–vanadium layered double hydroxide (NiV LDHs)
materials for supercapcitor application.

Herein, we report the
syntheis of NiV LDH nanosheets having various
compositions based on the amount of Ni and V (Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH) using a simple, low-cost, and potentially
scalable hydrothermal technique. The as-prepared NiV LDH nanosheets
were coated on Ni foam and used as supercapacitor electrode. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used for
their morphological, structural, and physical characterizations, while
electrochemical characterization techniques such as CV, galvanostatic
charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) were used to study the electrochemical properties of NiV LDH
nanosheets. Electrochemical characterizations of NiV LDH nanosheets
display outstanding pseudocapacitance performance for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. A high specific capacity of 711 C g–1 (1581 F g–1) was achieved at a current density
of 1 A g–1, which remained 549 C g–1 (1220 F g–1) at a higher current density of 10
A g–1. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device
with a working potential of 1.5 V was fabricated using Ni0.80V0.20 LDH as positive electrode and commercial activated
carbon as negative electrode. The HSC device exhibited a higher energy
density of 30.6 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 0.78
kW kg–1, which remained at 24 Wh kg–1 at a high power density of 11.1 kW kg–1. This
work suggests that the Ni0.80V0.20 LDH material
can be an excellent candidate for improving the energy density of
the HSC device.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphological Characterization
Figure 1 shows typical
XRD patterns of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH.
The XRD spectra of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH matched
well with the standard nickel–vanadium carbonate hydroxide
hydrate (JCPDS 052-1627). The characteristic peaks of the as-synthesized
NiV LDHs at 11.25, 22.78, 33.54, 34.47, 38.78, 45.55, 46.79, 60.03,
and 61.34° with respect to their corresponding (hkl) planes of (003), (006), (101), (012), (015), (018), (0012), (110),
and (113) indicate the LDH formation during the hydrothermal synthesis
(Scheme 1). It can
be noted that there was no peak appearance for impurities found in
the recorded spectra. Crystallinity of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH was higher compared to Ni0.67V0.33 LDH
and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH (Table S1).44 In addition, the interlayer
distances for the d003 plane calculated
form Bragg’s formula were found to be approximately 0.77, 0.78,
and 0.79 nm in Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH,
respectively.45 Literature studies suggest
that α phase of LDHs have larger interlayer spacing than β
phase of LDHs (0.46 nm), which was used to store more neutral water
molecules and carbonate anions at the interlayers.46 Thus, theoretically, α phase LDHs can be more electrochemically
active than β phase LDHs.47,48 The XRD spectra for
pure Ni hydroxide and V-based hydroxide are given in Figure S1, which shows that the XRD spectra of the former
matched nicely with pure hexagonal α-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS
file 38-0715). However, different characteristics are observed for
the latter due to its low crystallinity. Surface morphologies of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH were investigated
by field emission SEM (FESEM) images. Figure 2a–f shows three-dimensional morphology
composed of curved nanosheets for all NiV LDHs.41 The morphologies of Ni hydroxide and V-based hydroxides
are shown in Figure S2. To understand the
layer stacking and its respective morphology of the as-synthesized
NiV LDHs, TEM studies were carried out. Figure 3a–c shows the TEM images of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, respectively. The
TEM images confirm that the nanosheets’ thickness decreases
as the amount of Ni content is increased in the NiV LDHs, and it is
observed that 1–2 nm thick nanosheets were formed for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. Selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns (inset of Figure 3a–c) confirm the polycrystalline behavior of
all NiV LDH materials. Figures 3d–g and S3 confirm the uniform
distribution of Ni, V, and O in the nanosheets of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. The inset of Figure 3c shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, having the d-spacing of crystal lattice fringes to be 0.23 nm, which is assigned
to the (015) plane of NiV LDH. This was consistent with the XRD result.49Figure 4a shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm
for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH are presented in Figure S4. The shape of the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
curve was found to be type III isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop for
all NiV LDH materials, confirming their mesoporous nature. The BET
surface areas was found to be 111, 144, and 266 m2 g–1 for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH materials, respectively. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution curve in the inset of Figure 4a shows that pores are in the
size range of 1–10 nm for all LDH materials, along with pore
volumes of 0.140, 0.155, and 0.336 cm3 g–1 for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, respectively.
Most of the pores lie in the mesoporous range of 2–50 nm, thereby
enhancing the electrochemical performance of the NiV LDHs.50 The BET surface area is higher for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH due to its more exfoliated morphology compared
to Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, as supported by FESEM studies. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis was carried out to know the bonding between
the interlayers of LDHs. The FTIR spectra of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH are shown in Figure 4b. The broad and strong absorption bands
in Figure 4b at 3434
and 1629 cm–1 indicate the presence of stretching
and bending modes of hydroxyl groups, arising from interlayer water
molecules and metal-hydroxyl groups.51 Interlayer
anion CO32– was confirmed through the
presence of a vibration band at ∼1373 cm–1. The band at 2924 cm–1 was assigned to the CO32––H2O stretching vibration,
confirming the presence of hydrogen-bonded water molecules with carbonate
anions in the interlayers of NiV LDHs.52 A shoulder band at ∼1028 cm–1 confirms
the vibration band of hydroxyl groups, which are mainly corresponding
to metal cations (Ni2+ and V3+). Bands at lower
wavenumbers (less than 800 cm–1) were noted due
to the stretching vibrations of metal–oxygen bonds present
in NiV LDHs.53,54Figure 4c–f shows the XPS survey scan and
the corresponding core-level spectra of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. In this figure, two peaks at ∼855.6 and ∼873.3
eV correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively,
and are found along with two satellite peaks at ∼861.6 and
∼879.5 eV, indicating the native characteristic of Ni2+ spectra.55,56 The difference between the binding
energies of the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks
was found to be ∼17.7 eV.57,58Figure 4e shows the O 1s and V 2p spectra,
which confirm the O 1s core-level peak at ∼530.9 eV. The V
2p spectrum also confirms the presence of V 2p1/2 and V
2p3/2 peaks due to the spinning p orbital splitting. The
difference between the binding energies of V 2p1/2 and
V 2p3/2 is found to be ∼7.5 eV.59 V 2p3/2 spectrum in Figure 4f can be deconvoluted into three peaks, corresponding
to V (III) (∼515.7 eV), V (IV) (∼516.5 eV), and V (V)
(∼517.2 eV). This confirms that V is partially oxidized to
+4 and +5 oxidation states during hydrothermal treatment.60,61 A similar behavior was evidenced from the XPS images of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH (Figures S5 and S6).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of NiV LDH and Fabrication of HSC
3 Electrochemical Characterization
3.1 Three-Electrode Testing
A three-electrode
set up was used to investigate the electrochemical performance of
as-synthesized Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH.
CV studies were carried out for the potential window of 0–0.5
V in the presence of 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Figure 5a shows the comparison of CV
curves at 5 mV s–1 scan rate for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and
Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, respectively. From the CV curves
in Figure 5a, it can
be inferred that composition of NiV LDHs influences redox peak position
as the peak shifts toward positive voltage while varying the compositions
of Ni and V from 2:1 to 4:1. In addition, CV curves show a couple
of distinct redox peaks for all NiV LDHs. At the same time, it was
proved from galvanostatic discharge curves in Figure 5b that appearance of nonlinear shape for
all of the NiV LDHs exemplifies the quasi-reversible electron transfer
between electrode material and electrolyte ions, which further confirms
that the measured specific capacitances arise through redox mechanism.37,62 Evidently, the integral area under the CV curve of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH was comparatively larger than that for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, revealing its better supercapacitive performance. Supporting
the previous claim, the longer discharge time for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH compared to Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH also infers its better
supercapacitive performance. In addition, the characteristics of the
CV curve for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH did not change
much even after the scan rate was increased from 2 to 100 mV s–1 (Figure 6a). The CV curve suggests that redox current increases as
the scan rate increases. Also, as the scan rate is increased, the
anodic and cathodic peaks of LDH shift further toward positive and
negative sides, respectively, indicating the reversible Faradic process.
The redox peaks in the CV curves were due to the surface redox reaction
of Ni2+ and NiOOH, present in NiV LDH.63,64  GCD curves for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH show that the shape of the charge–discharge
curve was
retained as the current density was changed from 1 to 10 A g–1, confirming the high rate capability of NiV LDH material. The shape
of the GCD curves also confirms the battery-like behavior of NiV LDH
material.65 The maximum specific capacities
of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH were found to be 711 C g–1 (1581 F g–1), 622 C g–1 (1382 F g–1), 580 C g–1 (1289
F g–1), 559 C g–1 (1242 F g–1), and 549 C g–1 (1220 F g–1) at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 A g–1, respectively. Figure 6f shows the comparison of specific capacity retention and current
density for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH using
specific capacitance data for three different electrodes for each
NiV LDH material. The rate capability of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH (∼77%), as calculated from the GCD curves, was higher
compared to Ni0.67V0.33 LDH (∼58%) and
Ni0.75V0.25 LDH (∼35.5%) as the current
density was increased from 1 to 10 A g–1. The CV
and GCD curves for Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH are shown in Figure S7. Figures S8 and S9 show the electrochemical
characterization for pure Ni hydroxide and V hydroxides, respectively,
suggesting that Ni hydroxide has better redox behavior than V-based
hydroxides. Figure S10 presents the comparison
of CV curves for Ni foam, V-based hydroxide, Ni hydroxide, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. The CV curves show that contribution of Ni foam is negligible and
area under the curve is maximum for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. Table S3 exhibits comparative specific
capacitances for the electrodes with active materials of pure Ni hydroxide,
V hydroxide, Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH at
different current densities, showing that Ni0.80V0.20 LDHs have higher specific capacitance. The average specific capacities
(average of three electrodes) of pure Ni hydroxide, V hydroxide, Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH were found to be
197 C g–1 (467 F g–1), 60 C g–1 (144 F g–1), 377 C g–1 (839 F g–1), 473 C g–1 (1104
F g–1), and 603 C g–1 (1366 F
g–1), respectively, at a current density of 1 A
g–1. The EIS images of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH shown in Figure S11 reveal the higher specific capacitance for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH compared to Ni0.67V0.33 LDH
and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH. It further infers that
experimental data points well corroborated with the fitted data points
(Figure 6c). The overall
resistance, i.e., combining electrolyte (Rs) and contact resistances, and resistance due to electroactive material,
was found to be 4.54 kΩ for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH. In addition, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH was found
to be 883 mΩ (Table S2). Hence, it
can be inferred that the better supercapacitive performance of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH was due to its more exfoliated morphology
across the layers, which helps in channelizing more electrolyte ions
interaction with the electrode active surface and thus results in
more redox reaction.66 The linear relationship
between the peak current for anodic and cathodic peaks vs square root
of scan rate, as shown in Figure 6d, confirms bulk intercalation of electrolyte ions
into the surface of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, which facilitates
bulk redox reaction.26Figure 6e presents the specific capacitance
retention of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH with the number
of cycles at a current density of 1 A g–1. It is
noted from the cycling curves that the specific capacitance decreased
up to 40% during the first 1000 cycles and then remained stable up
to the next 10 000 cycles. So, the initial capacitance decay
is attributed to structure collapse, phase transformation, and reduction
in active surface area.67 Columbic efficiency
was found to be 100% up to 10 000 cycles.

3.2 Hybrid Supercapacitor Testing
To
further assess the electrochemical performance of NiV LDH material,
an HSC device was fabricated using Ni0.80V0.20 LDH as positive electrode and commercial activated carbon as negative
electrode. Ni0.80V0.20 LDH was chosen due to
its better supercapacitive performance in a three-electrode cell test,
compared to other counterparts. Scheme 1 shows the fabrication of HSC device. Electrochemical
results for commercial activated carbon are shown in Figure S12. Based on the GCD curves of activated carbon (Figure S12b) and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH (Figure 6b) at
a current density of 1 A g–1, the values of average
specific capacitance were found to be 205 F g–1 (C–) and 1366 F g–1 (C+). The potential windows ΔV+ and ΔV– are
0.45 and −1 V, respectively. According to eq 1, the optimum ratio of m– and m+ was found to be
2.78. The CV curves of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH and commercial
activated carbon were measured using a three-electrode system at a
scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte and
are plotted in Figure S13, which suggests
the optimized operating potential window for HSC to be 1.5 V. Figure 7a presents the CV
curves of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC
at different scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s–1. The
shape of the CV curves is almost rectangular with small redox peaks
present in the anodic and cathodic parts of the curves, suggesting
the pseudocapacitive behavior of HSC. There was no obvious distortion
in the shape of CV curve even at different scan rates from 5 to 100
mV s–1, thus confirming the higher rate capability
and fast charge–discharge properties of HSC.50 The GCD curves for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated
carbon HSC are shown in Figure 7b. The shape of the GCD curves is triangular with small deviation
in linear shape, confirming the pseudocapacitive charge storage of
Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC. The shape
of the GCD curves remained same even at higher current densities of
1–10 A g–1, suggesting the higher degree
of electrochemical reversibility of redox process and good Columbic
efficiency.37,51 The maximum specific capacitance
values for the constructed HSC device were found to be 98, 83, 82,
79, and 77 F g–1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4,
8, and 10 A g–1, respectively. The variation of
average specific capacitance of six such devices with current densities
is shown in Figure 7d, confirming ∼79% retention in average specific capacitance
at a higher current density of 10 A g–1. Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC device in Figure 7b shows a potential
drop of 12 mV at 1 A g–1 current density, which
was increased to 440 mV at 10 A g–1 current density.
The EIS curve of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon
HSC device in Figure 7c shows a similar shape to NiV LDH. The Ragone plot for Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC device is shown in Figure 7e. The device showed
an excellent energy density of 30.6 Wh kg–1 at a
power density of 0.78 kW kg–1, which remained at
24 Wh kg–1 at a higher power density of 11.1 kW
kg–1. A comparison of energy density and power density
with other reported materials is reported in Table 1. The cycling stability of Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC device is shown in Figure 7f.51,68−71 The cycling study shows a rapid decrease in the specific capacitance
for the first few ten cycles and then remained constant almost up
to 2000 cycles. The specific capacitance was found to be ∼42%
of the initial value after 2000 cycles. Moreover, Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon HSC solid-state device with
LiCl/poly(vinyl alcohol) gel electrolyte was successfully used to
power a red light-emitting diode of 1.8 V for almost 2 min after charging
with 8 mA.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have successfully demonstrated a facile and cost-effective
hydrothermal method for the synthesis of NiV LDH having controlled
composition. Electrochemical studies showed that Ni0.80V0.20 LDH shows better supercapacitive behavior than Ni0.67V0.33 LDH and Ni0.75V0.25 LDH due to its 3D exfoliated morphology. Ni0.80V0.20 LDH showed a maximum specific capacity of 711 C g–1 (1581 F g–1) at a current density
of 1 A g–1, which remained at 549 C g–1 (1220 F g–1) at a higher current density of 10
A g–1. The HSC device based on Ni0.80V0.20 LDH/activated carbon showed a maximum specific capacitance
of 98 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1 with retention of ∼79% (77 F g–1) at a
current density of 10 A g–1. The energy density
was found to be 30.6 Wh kg–1 at a power density
of 0.78 kW kg–1, which remained at 24 Wh kg–1 at a high power density of 11.1 kW kg–1. These results suggest that NiV LDH nanostructures have significant
potential as low-cost electrode material for the energy-storage devices.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
Nickel
chloride (NiCl2) (98%), vanadium chloride (VCl3) (97%), potassium
hydroxide (KOH), and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, average MW =
534 000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Urea (99%),
ethanol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and potassium
hydroxide pellets were purchased from Merck, India. Conducting carbon
black (Super P), activated carbon, and Ni foam were supplied from
MTI Corporation.

5.2 Synthesis of NiV LDH Nanosheets
NiV
LDH nanosheets were prepared through a one-step hydrothermal method.
In a typical synthesis, various mole ratios of Ni/V (2:1, 3:1, and
4:1 for the synthesis of Ni0.67V0.33 LDH, Ni0.75V0.25 LDH, and Ni0.80V0.20 LDH, respectively) were taken in such a way that the amount of total
ion concentration (Ni2+ and V3+) remains 3.2
mmol. In brief, different ratios of NiCl2 and VCl3 and 0.3 g of urea were mixed in 40 mL of deionized (DI) water and
stirred for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then, the solution
mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave
and the reaction was performed at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling
down the autoclave to room temperature, the obtained powder was washed
with DI water and ethanol. NiV LDH nanosheets were collected after
drying the resultant powder at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight.72 For comparison, pure Ni and V hydroxides were
also prepared following the similar procedure.

5.3 Material
Characterization
The surface
morphologies of the as-synthesized LDHs were observed by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 200, Zeiss, Germany).
Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Titan G2 60-300 TEM (HRTEM))
was further used to observe the morphology, size, and composition
of the as-synthesized LDHs. The crystal structures of various LDH
materials were analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained
from an X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert Pro, PANanalytical, the
Netherlands). Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used to obtain
the XRD patterns. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, PerkinElmer) spectroscopy
using KBr pellet method was used to study the presence of functional
groups in NiV LDHs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were carried out using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II, FEI Inc. spectrometer.
XPS binding energy values for all of the samples were referenced to
C 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.6 eV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
pore size distribution of the as-synthesized LDHs were measured through
the N2 adsorption–desorption method (Quantachrome
Instruments).

5.4 Electrochemical Characterization
NiV LDH, PVDF, and super P were mixed in a weight ratio of 75:15:10
in NMP solvent to make a homogeneous slurry. Ni foam (1 cm ×
3 cm) pieces were coated on a 1 cm × 1 cm area using this slurry
and dried at 80 °C for 12 h to make the working electrodes. Pure
Ni and pure V hydroxide electrodes were also prepared following the
similar procedure. The material loading was kept in the range of 2–3
mg for all electrodes. A three-electrode electrochemical set up was
used to study the supercapacitive performance of NiV LDH material.
The three-electrode assembly consists of NiV LDH-coated Ni foam as
the working electrode, Ag/AgCl/KCl, Pt rod as the reference electrode
and counter electrode, and 2 M KOH as the electrolyte, respectively.

HSC devices were fabricated using NiV LDH materials and activated
carbon as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. To maintain
the charge on positive (q+) and negative
(q–) electrodes, i.e., q+ ≈ q–, the ratio of positive (m+) to negative
(m–) electrodes was maintained
according to the following equation 1  where C+ and C– are
the specific capacitances of positive
and negative electrodes, respectively, and ΔV+ and ΔV– are
the potential windows for the GCD process of positive and negative
electrodes, respectively.26 The optimum
ratio was found to be 2.78 based on the specific capacitance values
for positive and negative electrodes at 1 A g–1.
The electrochemical performance of NiV LDH and HSC was studied using
potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab 302N, Metrohm, the Netherlands).
Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV),
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were conducted
at the open-circuit voltage over a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100
kHz. The specific capacitance (Cs) of
active material was calculated through GCD curves using the following
equations73 2   3   4  where I is the current (A), m is the mass of
active material (g) in the three-electrode
system, M is the total mass of active materials at
positive and negative electrodes in HSC, Δt is the discharging time (s), and ΔV is the
applied potential window (V). The energy density (E, Wh kg–1) and power density (P, W kg–1) of HSC were calculated using the following
equations 5   6
