Metal–organic
framework (MOF) glasses are a newly discovered
family of melt-quenched glasses. Despite considerable progress in
understanding the nature of MOF glasses, their photonic functionalities
have not been found so far. Here, we report on the first breakthrough
regarding the photonic functionalities of MOF glasses, that is, finding
of the luminescence in melt-quenched MOF glasses. The finding was
achieved on a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) series, that is,
the ZIF-62 series: Zn1–xCox(Im)1.7(bIm)0.3, x = 0, 0.1, and 0.5, where Co substitutes Zn in ZIF-62 forming
single-phased solid solutions. Remarkably, we observed broadband mid-infrared
(Mid-IR) luminescence (in the wavelength range of 1.5–4.8 μm)
in both the crystalline and amorphous solid solutions. The intensity
of the luminescence in ZIF glass is gradually enhanced by increasing
the level of Co concentration. The observed Mid-IR emission originates
from d–d transition of Co ions. The discovery of the luminescence
in ZIF-62 glass may pave the way toward new photonic applications
of bulk MOF glasses.

1 Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) play a significant role
in numerous potential applications, from chemical engineering, energy
storage to photonics and biomedicine.1−8 However, MOFs were synthesized in the form of powders with a large
specific surface area. To extend the application field (i.e., ionic
conductivity and porosity) of MOFs, a promising way is to produce
1D, 2D, and 3D MOF glasses by ball-milling, melt-quenching, and pressurization.13,19,42−46 Recently, such glasses were successfully made from
several zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs).9−12

ZIFs are a subset of MOFs,
where metal nodes are linked by organic
ligands through coordination bonds. They adopt the classical zeolite
tetrahedral network structure by substituting central metal atoms
(Zn or Co) for Si and Al ions and by substituting organic molecules
[e.g. imidazolate (Im) (C3H3N2–) or benzimidazolate (bIm) (C5H7N2–)] for oxygen. Furthermore, some
ZIF glasses even show permanent accessible porosity or blending structure.11,12 Despite rapid development in ZIF glass research, the photonic functionalities
of these glasses have not been found so far, and hence the optical
applications of ZIF glasses have not been realized. To change this
situation, we have performed the present study, that is, explored
whether it is possible to generate the photonic functionalities (e.g.,
luminescence), in ZIF glasses by tuning their compositions. If this
is possible, ZIF glasses can be potentially utilized in the field
of photonics. However, photonic functionalities of this new family
of glasses have not been explored so far.

To reach the above-mentioned
goal, here we choose the ZIF-62 system
as the starting object of this study because ZIF-62 is the best glass
former among the ZIF systems that we have tested until now.14 In addition, ZIF-62 glasses exhibit several
advantages regarding physical and chemical properties, such as high
transparency, feasibility of producing bulk samples, and high stability
against humid air exposure.15 Considering
these superior properties, we choose ZIF-62 as the starting materials
to develop the luminescent ZIF glasses. ZIF-62 has a chemical formula
of Zn(Im)2–x(bIm)x, where Zn ions are connected by Im and bIm in tetrahedral
coordination and each Im or bIm is coordinated by two Zn ions through
nitrogen atoms (Figure 1b). In the present work, our strategy is to substitute Co for Zn
in ZIF-62 during the hydrothermal synthesis to form single-phased
solid solutions, and then to melt-quench ZIF-62 to glass state (where
the ionic radius mismatch of Co2+ (0.58 Å) and Zn2+ (0.6 Å) in the tetrahedral coordination is small enough
(3.33%) to easily substitute Zn by Co).47 We first synthesized ZIF-62 single crystals containing Co ions (labeled
as C(ZIF-62:xCo2+)) with different concentrations
(Zn1–xCox(Im)1.7(bIm)0.3, x =
0, 0.1 and 0.5) using a solvothermal method. The ZIF-62 glasses containing
Co ions (labeled as G(ZIF-62:xCo2+)) were
obtained by naturally cooling the ZIF-62 molten to room temperature
(RT) in argon. We then examined the thermal and structural properties
of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) by using various techniques such as thermogravimetry
and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray analysis
(SEM/EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cross-polarization
magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS-NMR), and Raman
spectroscopy. Finally, we characterize the optical and photonic properties
of both C(ZIF-62:xCo2) crystal and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) glass samples by means of absorption and
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies.

2 Results and Discussion
Figures 1d–f
and S2 show the crystal structure and thermal
properties of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and
G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) by XRD and TG/DTA, respectively.
The XRD patterns of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figures 1e and S2c) demonstrate several diffraction peaks that
can be attributed to the lattice planes of orthorhombic ZIF-62 crystals
(Figure 1b) (space
group: Pbca, a = 15.505 Å, b = 15.809 Å, c = 18.172 Å).16,19 In contrast, there is no observable peak shift with an increase
of Co concentration (Figure S3c), indicating
that the substitution of Zn with Co does not lead to any lattice expansion
(or shrinking) of the crystal. In the DTA curve, we can see an exothermic
peak around 268 °C, which is ascribed to the release of the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (desolvation)
from the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) samples. From
the TG curve, the released amount of the sample accounts for 13.5%
(Figures 1d and S2a), while the Co-free ZIF-62 single crystal
starts to decompose at Td = 580 °C,
which remains unchanged up to 50% of Co doping. The melting point
(Tm) can be clearly observed at 447 °C,
which increases to 452 °C with increase in Co concentrations
in the prepared solid solutions (i.e., at x = 0.5)
(Figure S3a and Table S1). Upon melting of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) at 450 °C for 24 h, and subsequent cooling to RT,
we obtained the glass state of the G(ZIF-62:xCo2+), which is confirmed by the absence of diffraction peaks
in the XRD patterns (Figures 1f and S2d). Broad peaks at 2θ
= 15.12° and 31.74° indicate a typical amorphous structure
without a long range order. However, the intense diffraction peak
at 15.12° can be ascribed to a scattering length of about 6 Å.
This is the average distance between the strongest scatters in the
glass (i.e., Zn–Zn and Co–Co bonds).14,17,18 These glasses with different concentration
levels of Co ions demonstrate increase in the glass-transition temperature
(Tg) from 328 to 334 °C (Figures 1d, S2b, and Table S1) as the Co concentration
in ZIF-62 crystals increases from 0 to 0.5, respectively. Consequently,
the glass-forming ability (GFA) (defined as Tg/Tm) values were found to be 0.834,
0.839, and 0.837 at x = 0, 0.1, and 0.5, respectively,
which almost remains unchanged with the increase in Co concentration
(Figure S3b). These results suggest that
the inserting of Co ions into ZIF crystals does not affect the ultrahigh
GFA of the ZIF-62 glass.

The transparency of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) under parallel
and crossed-polarized light was checked using optical microscopy as
shown in Figure S4. The recorded optical
images under parallel and crossed-polarized light modes both indicate
high transparency and optical isotropy for crystals and glasses. Cooling
of ZIF-62 molten in argon results in morphological changes to layer-like
G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) glass.

To examine
the morphology of the synthesized single crystals and
glasses, SEM images were measured for the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+)
(Figures 2a, S5, and S6). The SEM images of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) reveal that the single crystals containing
Co ions with different x-values were precipitated
in the form of a shapeless continuous frameworks. However, a mixture
of spherical nanocrystals (<100 nm) and microcrystals (>1 μm)
(Figure S5) was observed, suggesting the
possibility of ZIF-62 single crystals to crystallize in the shape
of nano-/microspheres. The size of these nano-/microcrystals increases
with the x-value, indicating that the increase of
Co concentration facilities the formation of microcrystals rather
than nanocrystals. On the other hand, the microstructure of the glass
G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) differs greatly from that
of the crystal C(ZIF-62:xCo2+). Laminated
morphology (Figures 2a and S6) was observed in G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) with highly ordered layer configuration.
However, the natural cooling of the ZIF-62 liquid containing Co ions
to RT induces the survived molecular units to accumulate on each other
forming laminated glass. From elemental analysis, these shapeless
continuous frameworks, nano-/microcrystals (Figure S7), and laminated glass morphology (Figures 2b–d and S9) are enriched in Zn, C, N, and Co ions with homogeneous distribution
of the constituent elements, suggesting that the synthesized single
crystals and glasses are indeed single phased solid solutions and
it is not a physical mixture of pure ZIF-62-Zn and ZIF-62-Co. The
molar ratios of Co/(Zn + Co) ions (Figure S8) in C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) are 0.107 and 0.42
for x = 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. On the other hand,
from XPS spectra (Figure S10 and Table S1), the molar ratio of Co/(Zn + Co) was
calculated, recording 0.097 and 0.48 for C(ZIF-62:0.1Co2+) and C(ZIF-62:0.5Co2+), which are more accurate values
in comparison with EDX values and match with the nominal Co concentration
added during synthesis. The XPS spectra of G(ZIF-62:0.5Co2+) and C(ZIF-62:0.5Co2+) for Zn, N, C, and Co orbitals
are identical, implying no obvious change in their chemical environments.

C, and (d) N.

A molar Im/(Im + bIm)
ratio of 0.1 was used during the synthesis
process, targeting ZIF-62 crystals with the composition of Zn1–xCox(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25. However, from solution 1H NMR measurements (Figure S14), the bIm/(Im
+ bIm) ratios were found to be 0.15 and 0.16 for Co free ZIF-62 crystals
and glass, demonstrating the chemical compositions of Zn(Im)1.70(bIm)0.30 and Zn(Im)1.68(bIm)0.32, respectively. In addition, solution 1H NMR spectra of
ZIF-62 crystals and glass containing Co ions (@ x = 0.5) (Table S1 and Figure S15) record molar bIm/(Im + bIm) ratio of 0.16 (i.e.
Zn0.5Co0.5(Im)1.68(bIm)0.32) and 0.17 (i.e. Zn0.5Co0.5(Im)1.66(bIm)0.34), respectively. 1H NMR data indicate
that the bIm is incorporated preferentially over Im in the framework
as a result of the higher acidity of bIm compared to Im.14,18 On the other hand, the molar bIm/(Im + bIm) ratios of the melt-quenched
glasses are slightly higher than those of the parent crystals, implying
that some Im linker decomposes during melting. The linker ratio slightly
increased from 0.15 to 0.16 upon the addition of Co to the synthesis
mixture (i.e., x = 0.5), suggesting the preference
of bIm to coordinate with Co rather than Zn.

To investigate
the local structure of the prepared crystals and
glasses, we recorded Raman spectra of both C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+)
(Figures 3 and S12). The Raman spectra of the C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figures 3a and S12a) reveal vibration
frequencies typical for the tetrahedral ZIF-62 structure.10,14 The peak at 1278 cm–1 (Figure S12c) is attributed to the symmetric stretching of C–N
bond in the organic linker, which is slightly blue-shifted as the x-value increases. In the low wavenumber range (65–400
cm–1) (Figures 3b and S12b), the rocking
δ(Zn–N), symmetric νs(Zn–N),
and asymmetric νa(Zn–N) stretching vibrations
of the Zn–N bond, as well as the symmetric νs(Co–N) stretching of the Co–N bond, can be observed
at 149, 179, 253, and 320 cm–1, respectively.18−24,26−28 These results
suggest that the Co and Zn ions are coordinated with the same organic
linkers (Im and bIm). In addition, the peaks at 78 and 120 cm–1 indicate that the coordinated organic ligands to
Co and Zn ions have some vibration modes with low phonon energy, which
possibly arise from the rotation of these species.23,24 After formation the ZIF glasses, Raman spectra of the G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figures 3a,b and S12d,e) illustrate
the same vibration frequencies as those of C(ZIF-62:xCo2+), which become broadened as a result of the transformation
from crystalline into glass state. While, low wavenumber peaks gradually
disappear with increasing Co content. This confirms that no decomposition
or evaporation took place during the melting-cooling process, and
Zn–N and Co–N bonds and organic linker structure remain
retained after quenching.17

insets of (c,d) show the molecular structure of ZIF-62.

To unravel the molecular structure of the prepared
crystals and
glasses, we measured the 15N and 13C spectra
of C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) by CPMAS-NMR (Figures 3 and S13). The 15N spectra of C(ZIF-62:xCo2+)
and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figures 3c and S13a,b) show two sharp peaks at 172 and 156 ppm, which are
assigned to the N atoms in Im (N1 and N2) and
bIm (N3 and N4), respectively (see the inset
in Figure 3c).16,25 The 13C spectra of C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figures 3d and S13c,d) display all the carbon resonances of
both Im and bIm, which overlap with each other, producing three broad
peaks at 142, 126, and 117 ppm. In addition, there is a single peak
located at 149.6 ppm, which is attributed to C1 of bIm
(see the inset in Figure 3d). The broad peak at 142 ppm consists of three overlapped
peaks at 141.6, 143, and 143.6 ppm, which are assigned to C2,7 (bIm) and C8 (Im), respectively. The second broad peak
at 126 ppm also contains three peaks at 123, 125.5, and 128.2 ppm,
which overlap to each other. These peaks (i.e., 123, 125.5, and 128.2
ppm) are attributed to C4 (bIm), C9,10 (Im),
and C5 (bIm), respectively. There are two overlapped peaks
at 116.8 and 115.8 ppm that are attributed to C3 and C6 of bIm, forming a weak broad peak around 117 ppm. These results
are in good agreement with previous reports of the ZIF-62 single crystal.10,14 The peaks in the 15N and 13C NMR spectra of
C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) are broadened with increasing Co content because
of the paramagnetic effect of Co ions. Compared with the spectra of
C(ZIF-62:xCo2+), all the peaks of the 15N and 13C NMR of G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) become wider because of the transformation from crystalline
into amorphous phase, but without peak shift. Importantly, the 15N and 13C spectra of both C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+)
are almost identical, implying that the organic linkers are survived
in the quenched glasses.

From the optical image (Figure S1),
the introduction of optically active Co ions with a particle-filled
3d orbital (3d7) into the ZIF-62 host results in strong
purple coloration. Generally, the spectroscopic properties of Co ions
depend on how and to whom they are coordinated according to the crystal
field theory. Normally, Co ions in an oxygen-coordinated tetrahedral
site show three absorption peaks at 590 nm (4A2(4F) → 4T1(4P)),
1.5 μm (4A2(4F) → 4T1(4F)), and 2.3 μm (4A2(4F) → 4T2(4F)) (Figure 4a),29−31 while in the case of nitrogen-coordinated tetrahedral
site (Figure 4a), in
which the crystal field strength is stronger, these absorption peaks
significantly shifted to around 570, 1100, and 3500 nm, respectively.32−34 The absorption spectra of both C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figure S11c,d) display peaks at 570 nm and 1.1
μm, confirming that the Co ions are in the nitrogen tetrahedral
site. Moreover, the full width at half-maximum of the broad absorption
peak (Figure 4c) at
1.1 μm slightly increases by Δλ = 35 nm as a result
of the transformation of the prepared crystal into glass, while the
absorption peak of Co doped glasses is usually much wider than those
in crystalline materials.30 This observation
suggests that the crystal field and/or site-symmetry around Co ions
may be slightly decreased after quenching, indicating the highly ordered
local structure around Co in ZIF glass (i.e., the structural ordering
around cobalt in ZIF-62 glass is high like those in ZIF-62 single
crystals but it slightly decreased compared to that of the parent
ZIF-62 crystal).

The PL spectra of both C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) and G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) in the mid-infrared
(Mid-IR) region were recorded under excitation by 980 nm laser diodes
(LDs) (Figure S11a,b). The Co-free ZIF-62
crystal and glass do not show any luminescence. In contrast, remarkably
the crystalline and glassy solid solutions containing Co ions exhibit
broadband Mid-IR emission in the wavelength range of 1.5–4.8
μm, which gradually increases the intensity with increasing x-value (Co content).35 On the
other hand, the Mid-IR luminescence intensity of the G(ZIF-62:xCo2+) is stronger than that of C(ZIF-62:xCo2+) (Figure 4b,d), which is probably linked with the surface/morphology/scattering
effect, and it is not an intrinsic property of the glass. This is
the first observation of luminescence in a ZIF-62 glass, which could
potentially be important for photonic applications of MOF glasses,
for example, Mid-IR lasers. The broadband emission spectrum consists
of two overlapped peaks, which can be assigned to the 4T1(4F) → 4T2(4F) transition (2.45 μm) and the 4T2(4F) → 4A2(4F)
transition (3.5 μm) (Figure 4a). From the emission spectra, the PL bands for both
groups of samples show fine energy band structures, which can be attributed
to the microstructural distortion in ZIF-62 because of the larger
tetrahedral units, for example, compared to those in oxide materials.
Other possible reasons for the fine structure of energy bands remain
to be clarified. The observed high structural ordering around Co ions
ZIF-62 glass as well as the coupling with rotational and other low
energy vibration modes of the organic linkers may strongly suppress
the rate of nonradiative relaxation process, allowing ZIF-62 glass
containing Co ions to emit Mid-IR luminescence.36−41 This may explain the detection of Mid-IR emission of ZIF-62 glass
containing Co ions compared to any other glasses. In comparison with
other Mid-IR luminescent Co-doped materials, there are many crystals
doped with Co that demonstrate Mid-IR emission such as mixed halides
(AgClxBr1–x:Co (3.5–5.2 μm)), fluorides (MgF2:Co
(1.6–2.1 μm)), and sulfides (ZnS:Co (2.5–4 μm)).35,48−51 These Mid-IR luminescent crystals illustrate broad emission bands
especially in case of Co-doped mixed halides and sulfides, which cover
only about 1.7 μm or less of the Mid-IR range. However, the
melt-quenched ZIF-62 glass containing Co ions is characterized by
broad Mid-IR luminescence, which covers about 3.3 μm (i.e. from
1.5 to 4.8 μm) of the Mid-IR range. The Mid-IR emission that
observed in ZIF-62 glass is much wider than those in mixed halides
and sulfides doped with Co ions. The observation of broad Mid-IR luminescence
in ZIF-62 glass containing Co ions may enable potential photonic applications
such as broadband tunable Mid-IR lasers.

3 Conclusions
Through the present work, we discovered broadband Mid-IR luminescence
in ZIF-62 single crystals and glasses containing Co ions arising from
d–d transition of Co ions. The strength of the luminescence
can be enhanced by increasing the concentration level of Co ions.
The results imply that the ZIF-62 crystal and glass containing Co
ions are new Mid-IR luminescent materials for photonic applications.
We have also investigated the structural properties of both crystalline
and amorphous ZIF-62 solid solutions containing Co ions. Our results
suggest that the prepared ZIF-62 single crystals are shapeless continuous
frameworks that can be transformed to laminated glasses upon melt-quenching.
In addition, the laminated glasses exhibit ultrahigh GFA and a similar
local structure to that of the parent crystalline MOF.

4 Experimental Section
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9%), Im (99.5%), bIm
(99%), and DMF (99.9%) were used as raw materials. As shown in Figure 1a,b, to synthesize
Zn1–xCox(Im)1.9(bIm)0.1 crystals with x = 0, 0.1, and 0.5, the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Im,
and bIm with the molar ratio 1 – x:x:13.5:1.5, x = 0, 0.1, and 0.5, were dissolved
into 50 mL of DMF and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon bottle.14 The bottle was tightly sealed and placed in
an electric oven at 130 °C for 5 days. After cooling to RT, both
colorless and transparent purple single crystal pieces were obtained
from pure Zn-ZIF-62 and ZIF-62 containing Co ions, respectively, and
they were purified by filtration and washing three times with DMF
and drying at 100 °C for 6 h (Figure S1). The corresponding ZIF-62 glasses (Figure 1c) were prepared by heating the transparent
ZIF-62 crystals in a tube furnace at 5 K/min to 450 °C in argon
for 24 h and then by cooling the ZIF-62 liquids naturally to RT.

In order to characterize the thermal properties of the prepared
ZIF-62 crystals and glasses containing Co ions, the TG/DTA curves
were acquired using a CRY-Z differential thermal analyzer at the upscan
rate of 10 °C/min in argon. The optical images were recorded
using an OLYMPUS BX53M optical microscope equipped with a SC180-CCD
camera. The absorption spectra were measured using a Lambda 900 spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer, USA). The PL spectra were recorded with a spectrofluorometer
(iHR 320, Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a 980 nm LDs. The XRD
patterns were collected to identify the crystal structure using an
XPERT-PRO-PANalytical-Netherland instrument with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å). The EDX maps and SEM images were measured
to characterize the morphology by the ULTRA-55 SEM system. To evaluate
the network structure of ZIF-62 crystals and glasses containing Co
ions, the Raman spectra were obtained by a Raman spectrometer (HR
800, Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a 514.5 nm argon laser as the
excitation source. The XPS measurements were performed to characterize
the binding energies of the Zn, Co, N, and C using a Thermo Scientific
ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer, using a monochromatic Al Kα source.
Solid-state NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance III
HD 500 MHz NMR system equipped with a 4 mm MAS-NMR probe. 13C and 15N MAS spectra were recorded at 125.78 and 50.71
MHz, respectively. All the CPMAS experiments used ramped-amplitude
CP block and two pulse phase modulation decoupling during acquisition.
The spinning rate was 6 kHz. For 1H–13C CPMAS, the spectra were recorded under CP conditions with 90°
pulse of 2.6 μs and a contact time of 3 ms. The typically recycle
delay is 1 s, and the signals were accumulated over 4096 scans. For 1H–15N CPMAS measurements, the spectra were
recorded under CP conditions with a 90° pulse of 2.9 μs,
contact time of 3 ms. The recycle delay is set to 1 s, and the signals
were accumulated over 8192 scans. The 13C and 15N spectra were second calibrated to adamantane (δ = 38.5 ppm
for the methylene resonance) and Gly (δ = 347.58 ppm), respectively.
In the solution 1H NMR measurement, the prepared ZIF-62
crystals and glasses were dissolved into a mixture of DCl (35%), D2O (0.1 mL), and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6; 0.5 mL). All the measurements
were carried out at RT.
