Aimed at the green synthesis of supported
noble metal nanoparticles
without any additional reducing agents or stabilizers at room temperature,
a new strategy in which monodispersed Pd nanoparticles were successfully
immobilized on Mg–Al mixed metal oxides derived from layered
double hydroxides was developed, and the reduction mechanism was also
proposed. It allowed the in situ immobilization of monodispersed Pd
nanoparticles with a face-centered cubic structure, using only alcohols
with α-hydrogen atom as the solvent and reducing agent. Control
over the mean particle size and content of Pd nanoparticles was realized
by adjusting the temperature, initial concentration, and type of alcohol.
With the content of Pd varied from 6.4 to 42.3 mg/g, the mean particle
size of Pd increased from 1.1 to 4.9 nm. The as-prepared catalyst
showed high catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol: when
the Pd content was 6.4 mg/g, conversion of 60.3% and selectivity of
99.2% were obtained with a turnover frequency of 4807 h–1. Similarly, on the basis of the high stand electrode potentials,
immobilized Ag (5.6 nm) and Au (4.7 nm) nanoparticles were also prepared
through this methodology. Moreover, the choice of supports was extended
to other powder supports that would react with the byproduced acid.
Overall, this facile method opens up new opportunities for controllable
synthesis of supported nanoparticle catalysts in a green way.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metal nanoparticles exhibiting high activity and selectivity have
attracted intense attention. Although some homogeneous catalysts (e.g.,
organometallic complexes) show remarkable catalytic activity, they
still face serious challenges in separation and recycling. As a result,
immobilization of metal nanoparticles has become a field of continuing
interest. In particular, supported Pd has the reputation of being
one of the most efficient transition metals in catalysis. It is widely
used in many industrial processes, such as hydrogenation, oxidation,
hydrocracking, and Suzuki coupling reaction processes.1−5

In our previous work,6 it was found
that Pd2+ ions adsorbed on the surface of porous glass
would be reduced to Pd nanoparticles successfully by alcohol. However,
there are still two problems with this method. First, the reduction
mechanism is not clear: it was just hypothesized that the reduction
was catalyzed by a solid base, such as porous glass beads; second,
the choice of support is very limited. The weak mechanical strength
of porous glass beads (the porous shell part would be easily destroyed
by stirring) limits their further application.

Taking into account
the above problems, other supports with a broader
range of applications and better mechanical strength should be considered.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcite-like
compounds (HTlcs), are a type of anionic clay of inorganic layered
materials and their general formula is  where M2+ and M3+ represent
a divalent cation (e.g., Mg2+, Ni2+) and a trivalent
cation (e.g., Al3+, Cr3+), respectively. An– is the interlayer anion (e.g., CO32–, SO42–).
The value of x is typically in the range of 0.20–0.33,
representing the molar ratio of M3+/(M2+ + M3+), and m indicates the amount of water.7,8 Thermal decomposition of LDHs gives well-mixed metal oxides (MMOs).
Both of them have been utilized as promising supports for metal nanoparticles.
As the support, MMOs offer a number of advantages: variable composition
and ratio of cations, tunable acidity–basicity of the surface,
high metal-adsorption abilities, and a confinement effect, which would
help in obtaining highly dispersed supported nanoparticles.

Considerable effort has been devoted to the preparation of Pd nanoparticles
supported on LDHs and MMOs. Generally, the immobilization would be
separated into two steps. First, the Pd species is immobilized in
the form of ions; second, the supported Pd2+ ions are reduced
to the metal nanoparticles in the presence of a reducing agent and
a surfactant, when necessary. Thermal treatment with H2 at high temperature is the most common strategy, especially when
surfactants are used.9−14 For example, in the work of Onyestyak and co-workers,12 Pd nanoparticles supported on hydrotalcite were
prepared through the impregnation method and reduced with H2 at 623 K. However, this approach often suffers from aggregation
and an inhomogeneity in the distribution of metallic nanoparticles,
and difficulties in removing of surfactants as well, leading to loss
of monodispersity and catalytic activity. Alternatively, chemical
reduction agents, for instance, borohydride,15−17 hydrazine hydrate,18,19 hexamethylenetetramine,20,21 soluble starch,22 and cyclohexene, were also involved in the synthesis
process.23 Accordingly, other chemical
reagents, such as NaOH, was necessary or the temperature was higher
than 353 K. For example, as reported by He,16 Pd2+ ions supported on Mg2Al–LDH were
reduced by NaBH4 as follows: first, NaOH was added into
the aqueous solution containing LDH until the pH value reached 10;
second, Na2PdCl4 was added, and the pH value
of the solution was kept at 10 by adding more NaOH; third, NaBH4 was added starting the reduction. Therefore, it is of great
significance to develop a facile and effective method for controllable
preparation of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles in the immobilization
mode.

In this work, we explored feasibilities of both preparing
monodispersed
Pd nanoparticles supported on MgAl–MMO through an in situ method
at room temperature and obtaining a deeper insight into the reduction
scheme. As there is no need for subsequent thermal treatment, the
structure of the metal particle could also be retained, preserving
the active sites associated with high catalytic activity. It is worth
noting that the in situ preparation was conducted without any additional
reducing agents or stabilizers. Additionally, the choice of metal
nanoparticles could be extended to other noble metal nanoparticles
(Ag and Au), and the choice of support could be other powder supports
that would react with the byproduced acid. As far as we know, a green
and facile strategy for the preparation of noble metal nanoparticles
immobilized on MgAl–MMO at room temperature has never been
reported before. The effects of temperature, initial concentration,
and type of alcohol on the morphology and loading amount of Pd nanoparticles
have been studied systematically, and the catalytic performance of
the as-prepared catalyst has also been investigated.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and Chemicals
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, PdCl2, NaOH,
and Na2CO3 were all analytical reagents and
purchased
from Beijing Chemical Plant. Methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and tert-butyl
alcohol were all analytical grade and purchased from Fuchen Chemical
Plant in Tianjin, China. AgNO3 and HAuCl4·3H2O and MgO nanoparticles (the mean particle size was 50 nm)
were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co.

2.2 Preparation
and Characterization of MgAl–MMO
Supported with Pd Nanoparticles
Preparation of MgAl–MMO
support (by the modified coprecipitation method at a pH value of 10.0):
typically, alkaline solution containing Na2CO3 and NaOH was added dropwise into deionized water until the pH value
reached 10 (detected by Mettler Toledo FE20). Then, 9.0 mmol Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 mmol Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 100 mL
of deionized water. The mixture was added dropwise into the as-prepared
alkaline solution, maintaining the pH value around 10 by adding more
alkaline solution. The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature
for 8 h; then the precipitates were separated from the solution by
centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the pH value
reached 7. After being dried at 353 K for 12 h, the precipitates were
calcinated at 823 K for 4 h.

Immobilization of Pd species: 0.1
g of MgAl–MMO was suspended in 30 g of PdCl2–alcohol
solution (the initial concentration varied from 30 to 400 ppm) at
a speed of 750 rpm. The mixtures were stirred for 1 h at different
temperatures. After the immobilization process, the solid was separated
from the solution by centrifugation and dried for 12 h at 373 K. The
yield of supported nanoparticles (Y) through the
immobilization process can be described as eq 1. 1  where C0 and Ct mean the concentration of the target metal
element before and after the immobilization process, respectively.

SEM images were obtained via SEM (S-4500; Hitachi Ltd., Japan).
The morphology of the prepared composite was studied by TEM (JEOL
JEM-2011). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker
D8 Advanced powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation.
Contents of metal elements in the prepared composite were measured
via inductively coupled plasma (ICP; IRIS Intrepid II XSP from ThermoFisher
Corp.). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were analyzed
on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C chemisorption–physisorption
analyzer. The pore size distribution was obtained using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. Surface compositions and binding energies were detected
using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (PHI-1600 spectrometer;
Perkin-Elmer).

2.3 Catalytic Activity for
Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation
The catalytic oxidation of benzyl
alcohol was performed in a two-necked
round bottomed flask (25 mL) equipped with a reflux condenser. Benzyl
alcohol (substrate, 5 mL) and the Pd-based catalyst (0.1 g) were loaded
in the flask and heated to 373 K in an oil bath with a stirring rate
of 800 rpm. The vapor products were condensed during the reaction.
As the oxidant, oxygen was bubbled into the mixture at a speed of
20 mL/min starting the reaction. After 1 h reaction, the catalyst
was separated by centrifugation, and the products were analyzed using
a Shimadzu 2014 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a DB-WAX (30
m × 0.320 mm, df = 0.25 μm) capillary column and a flame
ionization detector. Dodecane was used as an internal standard for
quantitative GC analysis. The conversion, selectivity, and turnover
frequency (TOF) are defined by eqs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 2   3   4  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Proposal
of the New Strategy and Reduction
Scheme
During the catalyst synthesis process, color changes
in MgAl–MMO powder and the Pd2+-containing solution
were clearly observed (Figure 1). The Pd2+-containing solution turned much lighter,
and white powders turned to black after the mixing.

Figure 1 Color changes in MgAl–MMO
powder and Pd2+-containing
solution. (a) and (b): Pd2+-containing solution before
and after the mixing, respectively; (c) and (d): MgAl–MMO powder
before and after the mixing, respectively.

SEM images of the MgAl–MMO powder before and after
the immobilization
of Pd are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2, respectively), and BET results of the MgAl–MMO
powder before and after the immobilization of Pd are given in Table S1 and Figure S3, respectively. After the
immobilization of Pd, the surface area increased from 144.7 to 300.7
m2/g due to the formation of micropores of around 1 nm
(the reason is discussed later). As expected, the successful immobilization
of Pd nanoparticles on MgAl–MMO could be supported by XRD,
XPS, and TEM analyses. The wide-angle XRD patterns of the sample are
shown in Figure 2a;
the characteristic peak at around 40° could be readily indexed
to the (111) reflection of Pd (JCPDS 87-0641). Figure 2b reveals the XPS result. Sharp peaks with
binding energy values of 335 and 340 eV for Pd 3d5 and Pd 3d3 could
be observed, respectively, indicating the formation of Pd nanoparticles.24−26 As shown in Figure 2c, Pd nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of
MgAl–MMO. The EDS analysis confirmed the introduction of Pd
(as shown in Figure S4 and Table S2). As
shown in the HRTEM image (Figure 2d), lattice fringes of 0.227 nm are clearly observed,
attributing to the (111) lattice spacing of the Pd crystal with the
face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.

(b) XPS spectra
of the Pd-decorated MgAl–MMO; (c) and (d) TEM images of the
Pd-decorated MgAl–MMO.

To investigate the reduction mechanism, we designed three
groups
of experiments.

First, 0.1 g of the prepared MgAl–MMO
was suspended in the
Pd2+-containing solution and stirred for 1 h at room temperature.
Then, the solution was analyzed by GC. Results showed that acetaldehyde
was produced during the process, proving that Pd2+ ions
were reduced by alcohol. In addition, the molar amounts of the formed
acetaldehyde and Pd nanoparticles were equal in value. Detailed GC
analysis results are given in Figure S5 and Table S3, respectively. Similar results have also been reported by
Mori and co-workers;27,28 monomeric PdCl2 species,
which was chemisorbed on the hydroxyapatite (HAP) surface, transformed
into Pd nanoclusters in the presence of alcohols at 363 K, and the
corresponding aldehydes were detected as the byproduct.

Second,
the influence of the type of alcohol was studied. Depending
on whether there is an α-hydrogen atom, these alcohols were
separated into two groups: the first group with an α-hydrogen
atom, for example, methanol and 1-propanol; the second group without
an α-hydrogen atom, for example, tert-butyl alcohol. Dark powders
and the corresponding carbonyl compounds were obtained in cases of
methanol and 1-propanol, whereas no dark powder was observed when
tert-butyl alcohol was used. Samples treated with different alcohols
were characterized by XPS, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, Pd nanoparticles
could just be obtained using alcohols with an α-hydrogen atom;
in other words, only alcohols with an α-hydrogen atom would
act as both the solvent and reducing agent.

ethanol	yes	335.1	340.2	
1-propanol	yes	335.0	339.9	
tert-butyl alcohol	no	336.7	342.9	
Third, the effect of the support
was discussed. Considering that
MgAl–MMO is composed of MgO and Al2O3, these two kinds of oxides were used as the support separately to
investigate their individual contributions. Moreover, SiO2 powders, which are usually used as a catalyst support, were also
tested in this work. After 3 h of mixing with the Pd2+-containing
solution at room temperature, only MgO powders became dark, indicating
immobilization of Pd nanoparticles. We detected the concentrations
of Mg2+ and Pd2+ through ICP. As shown in Table 2, the concentration
of Pd element decreased from 233.40 mg/L (2.20 mmol/L) to 0.03 mg/L
(0.00 mmol/L), whereas the concentration of Mg element increased from
0.08 mg/L (0.00 mmol/L) to 27.80 mg/L (1.16 mmol/L). Meanwhile, a
blank experiment was carried out without the addition of Pd precursors
(other reaction conditions were kept the same). Results showed that
concentrations of Pd and Mg elements were 0.02 mg/L (0.00 mmol/L)
and 2.2 mg/L (0.09 mmol/L), respectively. Obviously, elemental
Pd was enriched on the surface of the support (proved by XRD and TEM
results as stated above), and elemental Mg migrated from the solid
support to the solution after the mixing.

Table 2 Concentrations
of Metal Elements before
and after Mixing
element	concentration before mixing (mg/L)	concentration before mixing (mmol/L)	concentration
after mixing (mg/L)	concentration after mixing (mmol/L)	
Pd	233.40	2.20	0.03	0.00	
Mg	0.08	0.00	27.80	1.16	
It is worth mentioning that dark powders were also observed using
Al2O3 as the support after 24 h. After filtration,
the three kinds of oxides were characterized by XRD and XPS. As expected,
Pd species existed as Pd nanoparticles on MgO and Al2O3 powders, whereas only Pd2+ ions were obtained
using SiO2 as the support. Detailed results are given in Figure S6 and Table S4.

As reported by
Fievet et al. and Xia et al.,29−31 in a solution
of ethylene glycol, metal ions could be reduced to nanoparticles after
stirring at 413 K for 1 h, byproducing HCl. It provided referable
thoughts for our work.

Thus, upon consideration of the above
results and reaction features
between HCl and MgO (MgO was taken as an example here), a possible
scheme for the reduction is proposed as eq 5. Ethanol serves as the solvent and reducing
agent at the same time. According to this hypothesis, the reduction
would occur in a similar manner as that in the case of MgO when solids
that would react with HCl (the anion Cl–1 came from
the precursor PdCl2, and if the precursor is changed to
nitrate, HNO3 would be obtained here) are used as the support.
For example, immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on Al2O3 was realized but in a much slower way. It also explains why
the reduction takes place just at room temperature (under mild conditions).
On the basis of Le Chatelier’s principle, the elimination of
HCl would enhance the reduction process of metal ions, yielding Pd
nanoparticles simultaneously. Furthermore, the increase in surface
area and the formation of micropores of around 1 nm would be explained
as a result of the reaction between the support and HCl. In other
words, because of the reaction between the support and the byproduced
acid, the reduction took place at room temperature and the surface
area of the catalysts increased after immobilization of metal nanoparticles. 5  

3.2 Highly Controllable Synthesis of Pd Nanoparticles
Supported on MgAl–MMO
It is well known that the size
of nanoparticles plays a key role in determining the catalytic performance,
and we still face serious challenges in precise control over their
size distribution. On the basis of the mechanism mentioned above,
several key parameters, such as the reaction temperature, the initial
concentration of Pd2+, and the type of alcohol, are dominant
in the formation of Pd nanoparticles.

Herein, a series of MgAl–MMO
supported with Pd nanoparticles were prepared at different temperatures,
and their TEM images are shown in Figure 3. With the reaction temperature increased
from 303 to 343 K, the mean diameter of Pd nanoparticles grew gradually
from 1.6 to 3.5 nm. Moreover, the loading amount of Pd showed the
same trend, increasing from 11.9 to 26.8 mg/g. Concentrations of Pd
element before and after the immobilization process were detected,
and they are listed in Table 3. An increase in the reaction temperature greatly promoted
the yield of Pd nanoparticles from 44 to 99%, and the utilization
efficiency of the noble metal was also enhanced. Obviously, the reaction
temperature showed significant influence on the particle size, loading
amount, and even the yield of Pd nanoparticles. It may have resulted
from the faster rate of the formation of Pd nanoparticles and their
frequent collisions in the course of stirring for a given period at
higher temperatures.

K (b),
and 343 K (c). Histograms of particle size distribution for Pd nanoclusters

323	89.88	16.54	82	
343	89.88	0.55	99	
The
initial concentration of Pd2+ ions is another crucial
factor influencing the mean particle size and loading amount of Pd
nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 4, with the increase in initial concentration from 30
to 400 ppm, the mean diameter of Pd nanoparticles increased steadily
from 1.1 to 4.9 nm, and the loading amount increased from 6.4 to 42.3
mg/g. However, the yield of Pd nanoparticles decreased from 71 to
35%. The loading amount of Pd nanoparticles would be promoted efficiently
by increasing the initial concentration; however, it also results
in lower utilization efficiency.

with an initial concentration
of 30 ppm (a) and 400 ppm (b) of Pd2+. Histograms of particle
size distribution for Pd nanoclusters prepared with an initial concentration
of 30 ppm (c) and 400 ppm (d) of Pd2+.

The catalysts prepared with different alcohols showed different
loading amounts of Pd, which were determined by ICP, and it decreased
from 22.2 to 7.5 mg/g when methanol and propanol were used as the
solvent, respectively. Accordingly, the yields of Pd nanoparticles
were 58 and 32%, respectively. TEM images and the corresponding distribution
histograms of supported Pd nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5. The immobilized Pd nanoparticles
exhibited the largest size of 2.8 nm using methanol as the solvent,
whereas the mean particle size of Pd nanoparticles was the smallest
(1.4 nm) using propanol as the solvent. It may have resulted from
two reasons: first, the difference in the dielectric constant. It
is assumed that palladium chloride is partially dissociated in alcohol,
and a higher dielectric constant of the solvent means higher extent
of dissociation and higher concentration of Pd2+ ions;
second, the different reducing reactivities caused by the +I effect
of the methyl group (The Hammett constant of methyl is −0.170).32

3.3 Extension to Other Immobilized Metal Nanoparticles
This facile and green method could be extended to other supported
metal nanoparticles. Ag+, Au3+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe3+ ions were
examined using the method stated above, and it turned out that Ag
and Au nanoparticles in the immobilization mode would be obtained
(Figure 6). The mean
particle sizes of Ag and Au nanoparticles are 5.6 and 4.7 nm, respectively,
and the corresponding yields are 68 and 75%, respectively. XRD patterns
of the immobilized Ag and Au nanoparticles are given in Figure S7. The corresponding XPS results of the
immobilized Ag and Au are given in Figure S8. No reduction process was observed for other metal ions. This may
be explained by their stand electrode potentials (Pd2+:
+0.83 V; Ag+: +0.799 V; Au3+: +1.42 V; Cu2+: +0.344 V; Ni2+: −0.250 V; Co2+: −0.277 V; and Fe3+: −0.036 V).33,34 Metal ions with higher stand electrode potentials exhibit higher
potential for oxidation–reduction and are thus easier to be
reduced. In addition, the higher yield of Au nanoparticles compared
with that of Ag may have also resulted from the higher stand electrode
potential.

3.4 Catalytic
Activity for Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation
Pd-based catalysts
have been proved to be highly efficient in the
oxidation of alcohols, which is the most important reaction in organic
synthesis. To examine the catalytic performance of the as-prepared
catalyst (MgAl–MMO supported with Pd nanoparticles), catalytic
oxidation of benzyl alcohol under solvent-free conditions was chosen
as the model reaction. Then comparisons were made with other works,
and the results are summarized in Table 4. Under the same reaction condition, our
catalyst showed a conversion of 60.3% and a selectivity of 99.2%,
much higher than the conversion of 28.4% and the selectivity of 94.4%
given by Pd–MCM-41.35 Moreover,
the TOF (4807 h–1) is also obviously higher than
that of Pd–MCM-41 (2434 h–1).35 The excellent catalytic performance would be
ascribed to the much smaller mean particle size of Pd nanoparticles
(1.1 nm) compared with that of Pd–MCM-41 (7.4 nm). The 1H NMR
spectra of the oxidized product are shown in Figure S9. In the work of Polshettiwar and co-workers,39,40 they have developed a simple and sustainable method to prepare monodispersed
Pd nanoparticles (the mean particle size varied from 1.5 to 4 nm)
supported on fibrous nanosilica, and the catalyst showed high catalytic
activity for the hydrogenation and Suzuki coupling reactions. The
TOF values for the hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene and styrene are
122 and 732 h–1, respectively.

The TEM image of the catalyst after
the reaction is shown in Figure S10, and
the XRD patterns before and after
the reaction are provided in Figure S11a,b, respectively. After the reaction, Pd nanoparticles are still
highly dispersed on the surface of MgAl–MMO with the mean particle
size of 1.2 nm, confirming the good stability of the as-prepared catalyst.

In addition, catalytic activities of the as-prepared catalyst toward
other alcohols have also been investigated, and the detailed results
are listed in Table 5. As expected, the Pd–MgAl–MMO catalyst also exhibited
good catalytic performance for oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol
(with a TOF value of 4656 h–1) and 2-naphthalenemethanol
(with a TOF value of 1826 h–1). Furthermore, in
view of green process, this in situ method proposed in this work exhibited
obvious advantages of easy operation and environmental friendliness
without any use of ligands or stabilizers. In summary, it can be seen
that Pd–MgAl–MMO catalysts not only could be synthesized
through a facile in situ method but also showed high catalytic performances,
providing high promises for selective oxidation of alcohols.

4 Conclusions
A facile and green strategy without stabilizers for the synthesis
of supported Pd nanoparticles and the corresponding mechanism have
been proposed. Monodispersed Pd nanoparticles with fcc structure were
homogeneously immobilized on the surface of MgAl–MMO at room
temperature. Alcohols with an α-hydrogen atom acted as the solvent
and reducing agent. It has been demonstrated that successful immobilization
of Pd nanoparticles on other powder supports (which would react with
the byproduced acid, e.g., LDH with different Mg/Al ratio, MgO, and
Al2O3) would be realized through this methodology.
Both the mean particle size and loading amount of Pd nanoparticles
were highly adjustable. The mean diameter increased from 1.1 to 4.9
nm when the loading amount varied from 6.4 to 42.3 mg/g. Noble metal
nanoparticles with high stand electrode potentials in the immobilization
mode could also be prepared through the in situ strategy. For instance,
supported Ag and Au were obtained and their mean particle sizes were
5.6 and 4.7 nm, respectively. The as-prepared supported Pd nanoparticles
showed high catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol. By
using the catalyst with the Pd content of 6.4 mg/g, a conversion of
60.3% and a selectivity of 99.2% were obtained with a TOF of 4807
h–1. More research on the effect of support on the
catalytic activity and the shape control of the metal nanoparticles
would be carried out in the future.
