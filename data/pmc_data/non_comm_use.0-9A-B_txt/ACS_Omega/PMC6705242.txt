Contaminant
migration is strongly controlled by sorption reactions;
thus, the behavior of anions, which are (almost) not sorbing under
alkaline conditions, is an issue of environmental concern. This is
especially relevant in the frame of low and intermediate-low radioactive
waste repositories, where the pH generated by cement-based materials
is hyperalkaline. Selenite (SeO32–) sorption
on calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) phases—the
main cement sorbing minerals—has been investigated
by batch experiments, ζ-potential measurements, and thermodynamic
modeling to elucidate retention mechanisms and possible competitive/synergetic
effects of cation coadsorption. Selenite sorption was shown to be
nonlinear and slightly increasing with the C–S–H Ca/Si ratio; precipitation
of CaSeO3(s) was observed
for Se concentration higher than 2 × 10–3 M.
Indeed, the presence of Ca is essential to enable selenite retention
under alkaline conditions. Progressive additions of Na2SeO3 or NaCl salt to the phases produced a change in the C–S–H surface properties,
that is,
a decrease in the ζ-potential, in apparent agreement with anion
adsorption. However, this effect had to be also correlated to Na coadsorption,
as Cl showed null retention on the C–S–H phases. At the
same time, anion adsorption had a clear effect on
the retention of other cations (Ba) in the system. The distribution
coefficient of Ba (at trace concentrations) suffered a moderate decrease
by the presence of Na+ and Cl–, but it
was improved by the presence of Na+ and SeO32–, indicating complex competitive/synergetic effects
between anions and cations. All of the experimental data were satisfactorily
modeled considering a classical double-layer approach.

1 Introduction
The
assessment of toxic elements or radioisotopes migration, from
disposal sites or contaminated areas, requires an improved knowledge
of retention processes and the development of modeling tools for quantitative
predictions, trying to account for the complexity of real scenarios.1

Anionic species migration is a problem
of special concern, as they
present low adsorption in natural materials—thus, high mobility—especially
under alkaline conditions. Chlorine and iodine are relevant constituents
of different types of radioactive waste, and selenium (79Se) is a critical and long-lived (t1/2 > 105 year) fission product.2

In low- and intermediate-low-level radioactive waste repositories,
cement-based materials—which generate a hyperalkaline environment—are
used for the containment and immobilization of the waste.3 To assess the long-term safety of these systems,
radionuclide (RN) retention mechanisms on cement and its main mineral
components must be studied to improve basic knowledge and to be able
to develop predictive modeling based on a bottom-up approach.

Calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) phases are the
major cement hydration products and largely contribute
to retention processes because they are amorphous or poorly crystalized
materials with a large surface area. They have variable chemical compositions,
with their Ca/Si ratio being responsible for the different physical–chemical
characteristics.4

Previous studies
on Cl– retention in cement-based
materials showed that its sorption on hardened cement pastes (HCP)
or C–S–H is very weak5−8 and that its overall retention in HCP depends on the presence of
minor phases such as chloroaluminate or hydrotalcite. Baur and Johnson9 analyzed selenite sorption in various cement
minerals, including a C–S–H phase, where they
measured distribution coefficients, Kd, of approximately 210 mL g–1. Johnson
et al.10 studied selenite sorption on different
cement formulations, reporting Kd values
between 250 and 930 mL g–1. They suggested (possibly
irreversible) Se surface complexation and observed precipitation at
high loadings. On the other hand, Bonhoure et al.11 analyzed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy the uptake
of selenite (at high loadings) onto HCP and cement minerals, inferring
nonspecific interactions, and they did not observe selenite precipitation.

Thus, despite the number of papers qualitatively describing sorption
processes of (oxy)anions on cementitious materials, the mechanisms
of their interactions are not yet very well established5 and, to the best of our knowledge, literature
on detailed modeling of selenite retention in C–S–H phases, including
possible additional interaction effects with other
adsorbing ions, especially cations, is not available.

C–S–H phases may show
different affinities for anions or cations, as the sign of their surface
charge varies with the Ca/Si ratio.12−15 Anion and cations can be simultaneously
adsorbed on the phases to a different extent, but C–S–H with low Ca/Si
ratios, presenting negative surface charge, should
retain preferentially cations, whereas gels with higher Ca/Si ratios
are expected to better retain anions.

Because of the complexity
of C–S–H surface, the
diversity
of possible sorption mechanisms, and the
competitive effects (among different anions and/or anions and cations),
sorption processes on C–S–H are not straightforward
to understand. Their mechanistic description
is challenging but necessary for the development of predictive models.

The aim of this study is to analyze the adsorption of SeO32– (and Cl–) in C–S–H phases with different
Ca/Si ratios,
analyzing also cation coadsorption and possible competing effects.
Different sets of batch sorption experiments and electrophoretic measurements
were carried out to discern possible underlying interaction mechanisms
and to describe them by surface complexation modeling.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 C–S–H Gels Preparation
and Characterization
C–S–H phases with different
CaO/SiO2 (Ca/Si) molar ratios were
prepared, with the Ca/Si targets being 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.6 (C–S–H (0.8); C–S–H (1); C–S–H (1.2); and C–S–H (1.6)). Their
synthesis and all
sorption experiments were carried out in a glovebox, under N2 atmosphere (O2 < 1 ppm) to avoid surface carbonation
and to maintain the equilibrium pH. More details on preparation can
be found in a previously published work.15

The final pH and conductivity of the supernatant of C–S–H suspensions, as
well as Ca and
Si concentrations, are specific for each Ca/Si ratio and are summarized
in Table 1.

a The mean values
are obtained considering
different preparations.

The different compositions of the C–S–H phases and their
pH values are related to different stages of cement
degradation.

The mean N2-Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface
area measured for C–S–H (0.8), C–S–H (1), and C–S–H (1.2)
was 144 ± 40 m2 g–1; the mean value
measured for C–S–H (1.6)
was approximately halved (73 m2 g–1)
due to portlandite precipitation, as previously discussed.15

2.2 ζ-Potential and Particle
Size Measurements
The ζ-potential of the C–S–H phases (1 g L–1) was measured by laser Doppler
electrophoresis using a Malvern Zetamaster apparatus (5 mW He–Ne
laser, λ = 633 nm at a scattering angle of 90°). The ζ-potential
was calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility using the
Smoluchowski equation.16

To analyze
the behavior of the ζ-potential, upon chloride and selenite
addition (from 1 × 10–3 to 4 × 10–2 M), NaCl and Na2SeO3 salts
of high purity were used; the measurements were performed 3 days after
salts addition, and during this contact period, the suspensions were
maintained by stirring in the anoxic glovebox.

C–S–H particle size
was measured with a Malvern ZetaSizer Nano ZS (5 mW He–Ne laser,
λ = 633 nm at a scattering angle of 173°). In all of the
phases, the particles have sizes smaller than 100 nm15 but form aggregates with average size larger than 1 μm
because of the aqueous Ca content.

2.3 Batch
Sorption Tests
Sorption data
were obtained using the radioisotopes 75Se and 36Cl. Carrier-free selenite stock solution (as H2SeO3) was supplied by Isotope Products. 75Se is a gamma-emitter
(136 and 256 keV) with a half-life of about 120 days; its activity
was measured by γ-counting with a NaI detector (Packard Autogamma
COBRA II).

36Cl was supplied in NaCl form, dissolved
in pure water (Isotope Products). It is a β-emitter with half-life
of 3.01 × 105 years. Its activity was measured by
liquid scintillation counting with a PerkinElmer Tricarb 4910-TR apparatus.

Sorption experiments with the different C–S–H phases (10 g L–1) were carried out in an anoxic
glovebox under N2 atmosphere and at room temperature with
the samples in triplicate. Sorption kinetics was initially investigated
to determine the time required for the attainment of the sorption
equilibrium, and samples were maintained under continuous stirring
during the selected contact time (from 1 to 90 days) with a rotative
mixer (Rotator SB2, Stuart). In kinetic tests, the RN concentrations
were: [Se] = 1.3 × 10–6 M and [Cl] = 8.0 ×
10–7 M.

Sorption isotherms of 75Se were carried out with the
four C–S–H phases, with
[Se] ranging from 5 × 10–7 to 1 × 10–2 M approximately. Higher Se concentrations were achieved
by adding stable Na2SeO3. Sorption isotherms
under similar experimental conditions were also carried out with 36Cl. The contact time for sorption isotherms was fixed to
10 days.

The solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifuging
(25 000g, 30 min) with a JOUAN MR23i centrifuge.
After the solid
separation, three aliquots of the supernatant were extracted from
each tube for the analysis of the final Se or Cl activity. The rest
of the solution was used to check the final pH.

Distribution
coefficients, Kd (mL g–1), were calculated as 1  where Cin and Cfin are the initial and final concentrations
of tracer in the liquid phase (counts mL–1), respectively, m is the mass of the gel (g), and V is
the volume of the liquid (mL).

It can be anticipated that Kd’s
measured for 36Cl in all of the C–S–H gels were null
within the experimental error (Kd <
2 mL g–1), in agreement with
previous studies.5,7,8

Competition effects on cation adsorption due to the presence of
Cl– and SeO32– (from
approximately 1 × 10–3 to 5 × 10–2 M), in the form of NaCl and Na2SeO3, were
carried out by measuring Kd values of 133Ba ([Ba] = 3.4 × 10–10 M) as a function
of salts concentration. Barium was in the form of BaCl2 in HCl 0.1 M with a carrier of stable Ba (10 μg mL–1 solution); 133Ba has a half-life of 10.51 years, and
its activity in solution was measured by γ-counting with a NaI
detector (Packard Autogamma COBRA II).

Barium was selected as
reference trace cation in anion–cation
coadsorption tests as its sorption behavior was previously analyzed
and modeled in detail.15

2.4 Sorption Modeling
A classical diffuse
double-layer approach was used for describing surface complexation
reactions.17,18 The relationship between the
diffuse potential, ψ, and charge density, σ, is given
(for a symmetric electrolyte) by 2  In this expression, σ
is given in C
m–2, Ψ in V, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electron charge, z is the electrolyte
valence, and/is the ionic strength of the solution in mol L–1. To support the modeling, the calculated diffuse layer potential
was compared to the experimentally determined ζ-potential.16,19

Model calculations were performed using the geochemical CHESS
v. 2.4 code,20 and the geochemical database
was the standard EQ3/6; the constants for selenite were revised according
to Séby et al.21

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Batch Sorption Studies
As adsorption
of 36Cl was negligible (Kd <
2 mL g–1) in all of the C–S–H phases, it can
be considered as an indifferent ion.

The adsorption
kinetics of 75Se in the C–S–H phases with Ca/Si
ratios of 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 was analyzed first
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). Sorption
equilibrium was reached in a few hours in the C–S–H phases with Ca/Si
ratios of 1.2 and 1.6 and in a few days in C–S–H (0.8). No signals
of slower uptake
mechanisms or desorption processes were observed within the analyzed
time frame of 3 months. According to these data, the selected contact
time for sorption isotherms was 10 days.

Second, sorption isotherms
were carried out and the final pH values
after the tests were 10.30 ± 0.02, 11.72 ± 0.02, 12.00 ±
0.05, and 12.38 ± 0.03 for the C–S–H phases 0.8, 1,
1.2, and 1.6, respectively.

The results of selenite sorption
isotherms are shown in Figure 1, where data are
expressed as the logarithm of adsorbed Se per unit mass in mol g–1, Log[Se]ads, vs the logarithm of Se concentration
in the liquid phase at the equilibrium in mol L–1, Log[Seeq].

Figure 1 Sorption isotherms for selenite in the C–S–H phases (10 g L–1): (■) C–S–H (0.8);
(green
tilted square solid) C–S–H (1); (red circle
solid) C–-S–H (1.2); and (sky blue
triangle up solid) C–S–H (1.6). The continuous
lines correspond to model calculations (Section 3.4, Tables S1,
and Table 2). The dashed
box corresponds to the region
in which CaSeO3 precipitation is observed. The dashed line
represents the theoretical sorption behavior if precipitation is not
included in the modeling.

Selenite sorption depends on Se concentration, being nonlinear,
as shown by Kd values variation. The highest Kd (110 g mL–1) is measured
at the lowest Se concentration and the highest Ca/Si ratio; the lowest Kd (11 g mL–1) is measured
at a Se concentration of approximately 10–3 M and
at the lowest Ca/Si ratio.

The C–S–H phases with
higher Ca content are better sorbent solids for selenite even the
main difference is observed for C–S–H (0.8), which clearly
adsorbs less than the others. Kd values
obtained for selenite range between 50 and 100
mL g–1 approximately within the range reported in
the review by Ochs et al.5

Additionally, Figure 1 shows that sorption
isotherms present a first slight change in slope
at Se equilibrium concentration of around 5 × 10–6 M (black arrow), indicating that sorption sites of “low”
density might be saturating. Thus, the shape of the isotherm suggests
the existence of—at least—two sorption sites for selenite
sorption. As selenite concentration increases further, Kd values progressively decrease (the slope of the lines
in the graph is <1). Finally, at a concentration of approximately
2–5 × 10–3 M, a sharp increase in the
slope is detected. This last behavior must be related to the precipitation
of a solid phase, most probably CaSeO3.

X-ray diffraction
measurements of the phases upon selenite addition
at high concentrations were performed. Despite the difficulties of
recognizing (trace) phases within essentially amorphous solids, such
as C–S–H gels, the main
lines of CaSeO3·H2O could be identified.

3.2 ζ-Potential Measurements
ζ-Potential
measurements were carried out before and upon the addition of increasing
concentration of salts (NaCl and Na2SeO3). The
initial ζ-potentials (in mV) of the C–S–H were −11.7
± 3.0, −3.0 ± 0.5, 4.5 ±
1.0, and 11.7 ± 3.0 for the Ca/Si ratios of 0.8, 1, 1.2, and
1.6, respectively.

The charge of C–S–H depends on the
Ca/Si ratio:12,15 at the lower Ca/Si
ratios (corresponding to lower aqueous Ca), the charge is negative;
as the solute Ca and Ca/Si increase, the charge evolves toward more
positive values. This can be explained considering that Ca2+ is the ion determining the potential (IDP) of the C–S–H phases.12,15

The variations of the ζ-potential observed upon the
addition
of different salts NaCl or Na2SeO3 are described
in Figure 2. Selenite
precipitation may somewhat bias the results of electrokinetic measurements
for Se concentrations higher than 10–3 M, even if
the contact time of these experiments was shorter (3 days instead
of 10 days adopted for the sorption isotherms). The zone of possible
selenite precipitation is marked with a gray rectangle.

Figure 2 ζ-Potential
variation upon the addition of anions in the
form of (gray circle solid) NaCl and (sky blue triangle up solid)
Na2SeO3 to the different C–S–H phases (1 g L–1): (a) C–S–H (0.8), (b) C–S–H (1),
(c) C–S–H (1.2), and
(d) C–S–H (1.6). The
continuous lines correspond to model calculations (Section 3.4, Table S1, and Table 2).

In all of the cases, upon salts
addition, the ζ-potential
of the C–S–H phases tends
to decrease toward more negative values, and in principle, this would
agree with the (specific) adsorption of anionic species.22,23 Nevertheless, as Cl– has been shown to be an “indifferent”
ion, the overall effect on the surface charge must be caused both
by the adsorption of the anions and by the counter-cation Na,24 which will be accounted for in the overall analysis
of data.

3.3 Effect of the Presence of Anions on Ba Adsorption
in the C–S–H Phases
Sorption experiments with Ba, at a trace concentration, in the
presence of increasing concentrations of Na2SeO3 and NaCl were carried out to understand the possible role of anions
on cation adsorption in the different C–S–H phases. Figure 3 shows
the variation of Kd values for Ba, at
increasing salt concentrations. Again, the zone of possible selenite
precipitation is marked with a gray rectangle.

Figure 3 Variation of Kd for Ba ([Ba] = 3.4
× 10–10 M) upon the addition of anions in the
form of (gray circle solid) NaCl and (sky blue triangle up solid)
Na2SeO3 to the different C–S–H phases (10 g L–1): (a) C–S–H (0.8), (b) C–S–H (1),
(c) C–S–H (1.2), and
(d) C–S–H (1.6). The
continuous lines correspond to model calculations (Section 3.4, Tables S1, and 2).

The presence of the two salts causes different effects on Ba adsorption:
when NaCl is added, the distribution coefficients of Ba tend to decrease
slightly, whereas upon Na2SeO3 addition, Ba
sorption increases.

Considering that Na is a mildly sorbing
element in the C–S–H phases24 and Cl is not sorbing (Section 3.1), the small decrease in Ba adsorption
upon the NaCl
addition (Figure 3)
could be interpreted by the competitive effect of the two cations
Na and Ba. However, a double quantity of Na for a mol of anion is
present upon Na2SeO3 addition; therefore, a
stronger competitive effect might be foreseen. But the presence of
selenite favors Ba retention in all of the C–S–H phases.

This different behavior must depend on the relative
strength of
the complexes formed with the C–S–H sorption sites
and on their relative occupancy.

Indeed, the overall charge
clearly decreases when Na2SeO3 is added to the C–S–H phases (Figure 2),
and this must favor cation retention. A similar effect was observed
in refs25, 26, where it was reported
that the selenite coadsorption altered Co retention on γ-alumina,
depending on the selenite surface coverage: at low Se surface coverage,
no changes in Co sorption were detectable, but at higher Se loadings,
Co sorption increased. Electrostatic enhancement mechanisms, ternary
complexes formation, or surface coprecipitation were considered as
possible causes of these results.

Yet, the overall behavior
caused by Ba, Na, and selenite coadsorption
is very difficult to predict without detailed experiments and theoretical
modeling efforts, which may help discover possible mechanisms involved.

3.4 Modeling
To be suitable to predict
RN behavior in more complex systems, an adequate sorption model should
catch at least the main peculiarities observed in the different types
of experimental data. In the present study, it must fit: (a) the sorption
dependence on Se concentration and on C–S–H Ca/Si ratio (Figure 1); (b) the variation
of the ζ-potential (Figure 2); and (c) variation of distribution coefficient
for Ba (Figure 3),
as Na2SeO3 or NaCl concentration increases in
the system.

The surface properties of the C–S–H phases needed
for sorption modeling were already defined in ref15 and are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information); they were
fixed in the model. The adsorption behavior of Na on these C–S–H phases was analyzed
in a previous
paper:24 the parameters used to account
for Na coadsorption are included in Table S1 and fixed as well.

More details on the determination of these
parameters can be found
in refs15, 24. Briefly, up to three
different sites for cation adsorption may exist on the C–S–H surface: two types
of silanol
sites (SiOH) with different selectivity for cations (strong, S, and
weak, W) and ion-exchange sites, E, initially occupied by Ca (X2Ca). Ca is postulated as an ion determining the potential
(IDP). The densities of W and S silanol sites are 13 and 3.5 ×
10–3 μmol m–2, respectively,
and the density of E sites is 2 μmol m–2.

For anion adsorption, cation-exchange sites (X2Ca) are
not “active”; therefore, only the surface complexation
sites (SiOH, W, and S) were considered. Under alkaline conditions,
the silanol-like sites, SiOH, at the C–S–H surface are deprotonated
according to the following reaction 3  Ca is the ion determining the potential
(IDP)
of the C–S–H phases;
therefore, of special importance is the reaction between the deprotonated
silanols-like groups and Ca 4  Focusing on anion retention, several
studies
are available describing (oxy)anion complexation on oxides, especially
for selenium (ref27 and references therein). Selenite species (HSeO3– and SeO32–) are often
reported to form inner-sphere complexes with the mineral surface sites
(S–OH) according to reactions of this type28 5a   5b  Thus, according
to the anionic nature of its
species, selenium sorption is generally modeled considering complexation
with the protonated surface sites, S–OH2+ (eqs 5a and 5b).

In the case of C–S–H phases, pH conditions
are strongly alkaline, and surface functional
groups are mainly deprotonated (eq 3); therefore, the direct complexation of anions with
the silanol-like sites of C–S–H is unlikely. Furthermore,
the HSeO3– species (eq 5a) can
be neglected at very high pH, where the main aqueous species is SeO32–.

Preliminary modeling included
trials considering eqs 5a and 5b but,
in the end, best and credible results were obtained postulating that
selenite adsorption on the C–S–H phases depends
on the formation of complexes between SeO32– and silanol-like surface sites, where Ca2+ is already
adsorbed (eq 4).29,30

The chemical reaction used to describe anion complexation
in the C–S–H phases,
extensive
to any (oxy)anion,
Ann–, is the following 6  The main hypothesis for the selenite sorption
model is that the anion complexation with the C–S–H surface obeys
the reaction described in eq 6, evidencing the great importance of the presence
of Ca on selenite retention under alkaline conditions.

Second,
the shape of the selenite sorption isotherms indicates
that sorption is not linear and that a contribution of “strong”
sites to the overall sorption must exist.

The sorption model
was tested on selenite sorption data adjusting
the fit parameters, and considering, in parallel, its validity on
electrokinetic (Figure 2) and Ba sorption (Figure 3) data.

Figure 4 shows the
summary of the simulations obtained for the selenite sorption isotherms
(Figure 4a) and for
the behavior of the electrokinetic potential and the distribution
coefficient of Ba ([Ba] = 3.4 × 10–10 M) as
a function of Na2SeO3 addition (Figure 4b,c, respectively). In these
two figures, used for modeling purposes, the range of Se concentration
was limited to [Se] < 1 × 10–2 M because
for higher concentrations, the existence of precipitation was detected.
In any case, the simulations for the entire range of experimental
concentrations have also been included in Figure 2 (ζ-potential) and Figure 3 (Ba adsorption).

(b) ζ-potential, and (c) barium Kd variation upon the addition of Na2SeO3. (■) C–S–H (0.8), (green

The continuous lines correspond to model calculations (parameters
in Tables S1 and Table 2). The dotted lines in (a) correspond to
the model of sorption excluding CaSeO3 precipitation. In
the modeling of C–S–H (0.8), the contribution
of weak (W) and strong (S) sites is evidenced.

The sorption isotherms in Figure 4a are expressed as the logarithm of Kd (mL g–1), (Log(Kd)) vs logarithm of solute selenium concentration at equilibrium,
in mol L–1 (log[Seeq]), because with
this representation, modeling results as well as the observed nonlinear
sorption behavior are much clearer.

Table 2 summarizes the reaction and parameters used for simulating
the interactions of selenite with the C–S–H phases, and the
model calculations are superimposed to experimental
data in Figure 4 as
continuous lines. The contribution of weak (W) and strong (S) sites
to sorption, for C–S–H (0.8), is evidenced
in the graph.

As can be seen in Figure 4a, the model reproduces
quite well the selenite adsorption
data in all of the C–S–H phases. The mean
values for the complexation constants (eq 6) for all of the C–S–H phases are 1.55
± 0.17 and
−1.78 ± 0.27 for strong and weak sites, respectively (Table 2). Even if the standard
deviation for the parameters determined in the different C–S–H phases is not
higher than 15%,
a clear shift is observed in the complexation constants with the Ca/Si
ratio: the constants tend to increase as the Ca/Si ratio increases,
which might be an indication that the surface structure of C–S–H depends somewhat
on the Ca/Si
ratio, which deserves more detailed studies.

of Kd values observed
at selenite concentrations higher than 1 × 10–3 M can be fit reasonably well considering the formation of CaSeO3 (s) with a constant of 6.3 ± 0.2. This value is lower
than the value of 7.6 recommended by Séby et al.,21 but it is in the range of values reported in
the literature and agrees quite well with the one recently proposed
in the database review of Thoenen et al. of 6.40 ± 0.25.31

Without the precipitation of this solid,
selenite sorption would
continuously decrease, as indicated by the dotted curves in Figure 4a.

The model
is also able to well predict the variation of the surface
potential upon Na2SeO3 addition for all of the C–S–H phases (Figure 4b) and the experimentally
observed increase
of Ba retention in the presence of the selenite Na salt (Figure 4c).

The interactions
of selenite with the C–S–H surface caused
a decrease of their surface charge, toward more negative
values, affecting the coadsorption of other species. Ba adsorption
suffered a moderate decrease by the presence of Na+ and
Cl– (the latter not sorbing on the C–S–H
phases) but was improved by the presence of Na+ and SeO32–. Nevertheless, in Figure 4c, it can be pointed out that for the phases
with Ca/Si of 0.8, 1, and 1.2, at very low salt concentration, an
initial (slight) decrease for Ba sorption is predicted by the model.
Thus, both competitive and synergetic effects can be observed in this
system.

4 Conclusions
Selenite
(SeO32–) sorption on C–S–H phases of different Ca/Si ratios
(0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.6)
has been analyzed
by different techniques. Sorption slightly depended on the Ca/Si ratio,
with Kd values ranging between 10 and
100 mL g–1 approximately.

The interaction
of selenite with the C–S–H phases causes
a non-negligible decrease of their surface charge,
which affects the coadsorption of other species present in solution.
Both competitive and synergetic effects were observed in the system.
These effects, which are expected to occur in complex materials such
as cements and to be relevant in the overall radionuclide retention,
can be predicted only by a detailed analysis of experimental data
and appropriate modeling.

The integration of different experiments
is fundamental to explain
RN retention on complex systems such as cements and is necessary for
validation of sorption models. In this work, three different sets
of data were used to understand the overall behavior of selenite sorption
on the C–S–H phases and
competitive/synergetic effects with other cations in solution. The
final modeling adequately fits all sets of data.

This study
revealed that the role of Ca on selenite sorption on C–S–H is especially
important, as it
allows selenite retention under hyperalkaline conditions where, otherwise,
it would be hindered. At low-medium loadings, selenite adsorption
is driven by complexed Ca2+; at high loadings, selenite
coprecipitation with Ca represents an additional important retention
process, controlling the overall mobility of the anion.
