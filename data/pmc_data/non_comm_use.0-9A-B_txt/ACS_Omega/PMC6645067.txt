Improvement in photocurrent performance
remains the key subject
to prepare a stable and efficient photocathode in photoelectrochemical
cell (PEC) water splitting. Different to the ordinary methods, various
annealing atmosphere gases were used to study the growth of CuO films
on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate; then, the photocurrent performance
was studied when those CuO films were used as photocathodes in PEC.
The scanning electron microscopy images indicate that all of the CuO
films are composed of vertically arrayed CuO nanosheets, each individual
nanosheet with a thickness of 100–500 nm. Those hierarchical
CuO photoelectrodes in the PEC exhibit quite different photoelectrochemical
activities in visible light, where the air-annealed CuO film has nearly
6 times enhancement in photocurrent (108 μA) at 0 V compared
to that of film under oxygen atmosphere, and 34 times of argon. It
has an acceptor concentration of 2.9 × 1021 cm–3 from Mott–Schottky analysis, which is more
than 2 times larger than that of the oxygen-annealed CuO film, and
37 times larger than that of the argon-annealed film. Ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were carried out to explain
the improved photocurrent performance of the air-annealed CuO films,
where the obtained valence band of 0.44 eV and work function of 4.92
eV well match the reduction reaction of electrolyte (H2O).

Introduction
To obtain high photocurrent performance
in photoelectrochemical
cell (PEC) water splitting, copper oxides, such as cupric oxide (CuO)
and cuprous oxide (Cu2O), have attracted great attentions
due to their low cost, facile fabrication process, and fast time response
when they are used as photodetectors and photovoltaic devices. Both
the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) with a band gap energy of ∼2.1
eV and the cupric oxide with a band gap energy of ∼1.5 eV have
a strong absorption for solar light and are an ideal photocatalytic
electrode material.

For the PEC water splitting cell, under
light illumination, the
electrode material will absorb light and, at the same time, the separation
of the electron–hole pairs happens, where the electrons from
the conduction band of CuO will reduce the hydroxyl radicals (OH•) to OH– anions (e– + OH• → OH–) at the CuO/electrolyte
interface and the holes move from the CuO valence band through the
fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) into the external circuit to the Pt
layer. Different methods have been used to improve the photocathode’s
performance. For example, the enhanced photocurrent of the CuO photocathode
was realized by tuning the crystallinity and surface morphology of
films by rapid thermal treatment by Masudy-Panah et al.1 Meanwhile, the porous structure was reported
to result in an efficient photocathodic reaction under UV and visible
light illumination.2 And the photocathode
with the hierarchical structure produced an unprecedently high photocurrent
density.3,4 The mixed-phase Cu2O/CuO polycrystalline
NRs5,6 showed improved photocatalytic properties.

It is a common and effective method to improve charge transport
by controlling the atomic vacancies in a semiconductor in a photoelectrochemical
environment, and the vacancy created by oxygen (copper excess or oxygen
deficient) was widely used to realize better p-type conducting properties
of CuO. The common method to vary the vacancies was varying annealing
temperature,7,8 which will influence on the materials’
crystallinity, optical absorption, and grain size. But using different
types of gases to change the vacancies of CuO was rarely reported.

The good conductivity and the high specific surface area are requisite
for high photocurrent performance in PEC, as the former provides fast
carrier transport and the latter ensures enough light absorption.
Therefore, in this paper, self-assembly CuO nanosheet arrays grown
on an FTO substrate were prepared via a template-free growth method
using copper(II) nitrate trihydrate and ammonium hydroxide as precursors
and subsequently the prepared films were oxidized in a quartz tube
furnace at a temperature of 200 °C for 60 min under conditions
of air, oxygen (O2), and argon (Ar) flow atmosphere. Finally,
the annealed CuO nanoplates were used as photocathode to study the
photocurrent performance at the annealing conditions in the PEC.

The results showed that the air-annealed CuO film demonstrates
a great enhancement in photocurrent compared to that of Ar- and oxygen-annealed
films. And the mechanism behind was discussed.

Experimental Section
All chemicals used in this study had analytical-grade purity. Copper(II)
nitrate trihydrate and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) slides (7–8
Ω resistance) were provided by Hefei Kejing Materials Technology
Co., Ltd. Self-assembly CuO nanosheet arrays grown on an FTO substrate
were prepared via a template-free growth method using copper(II) nitrate
trihydrate and ammonium hydroxide as precursors. A growth solution
prepared by dissolving 1.165 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water under constant
magnetic stirring for approximately 10 min. Then, 2 mL of ammonium
hydroxide (25 wt %) was added dropwise to the green aqueous solution.
The solution was then kept at 70 °C without stirring in a drying
oven. A piece of FTO substrate (1 cm × 1 cm), which had been
ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and subsequently in deionized water,
was then hung in the growth solution for various reaction times at
70 °C and then a large-area uniform light-blue film covering
the FTO substrate surface was observed. The resulting films were rinsed
with deionized water and subsequently dried in air at approximately
60 °C. It should be mentioned that almost all precursor films
strongly adhere to the FTO substrate and cannot be removed from the
substrate by ultrasonic vibration in water. Here, three precursor
films were obtained with reaction times of 60, 180, and 240 min and
then were oxidized in a quartz tube furnace at 200 °C for 60
min under air condition, which are denoted as samples #2, #3, and
#4 h, respectively. Furthermore, the precursor films obtained at a
reaction time of 180 min were oxidized in the quartz tube furnace
at 200 °C for 60 min under air, oxygen (O2), and argon
(Ar) flow, respectively, corresponding to samples #air (#3 h), #O2, and #Ar. After heat treatment, dark films under the FTO
substrates were finally achieved.

Characterization
The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) using a Tecnai G2 F30 operated at an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV. Absorption spectra were carried out by using a Varian Cary
50 UV–visible spectrophotometer. And X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements
were conducted on an ESCALAB-250Xi photoelectron spectroscope.

PEC Measurements
PEC measurements were conducted in a typical three-electrode electrochemical
cell controlled by a Zanner CIMPS electrochemical workstation (Germany)
in 0.2 M Na2SO4, where the Pt wire was used
as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as the reference
electrode, and the prepared CuO nanosheet arrays with an area of 1
× 1 cm2 were used as the working electrode. Visible
light with a wavelength of 564 ± 60 nm was used as the illumination
source with a maximum output power of 120 mW/cm2.

Results
and Discussion
Morphology and Structure
To clearly
see the effect
of reaction time on growth process in the above-mentioned method,
we present the SEM images of precursor films grown on FTO substrates
with various reaction times in Figure 1a–c. SEM observation shows that the as-prepared
precursor films covering the FTO substrate are mainly composed of
compact stacked nanoplates with uniform size and distribution on the
substrate. As shown in Figure 1a, a reaction time of 120 min leads to large amount of nanoplates
randomly stacked compact together to form a nanoplate network. In
the high-magnified SEM image (inset in Figure 1a), the nanoplates were estimated to be ∼300
nm in thickness and ∼1 μm in width. Further increasing
the reaction time to 180 min, the precursor film was composed of clustered
nanoplates (Figure 1b). A magnified SEM image indicates that these nanoplates were ∼100
nm in thickness and 2 μm in edge length, as clearly shown in
the inset of Figure 1b. It should be noted that this type of spontaneous nanoplates have
unique low-dimensional nanostructures with high specific surface areas,
which may be particularly beneficial for photoelectrochemical applications
as the large specific surface area and ultrathin nanoplates play critical
roles in electron–hole separation. After 240 min reaction time,
as shown in Figure 1c, these well-ordered nanoplates are vertically grown on the FTO
substrate and the nanoplates become thicker, with an average thickness
of ∼600 nm and width of 5 μm. Additionally, the fracture
cross section of precursor film obtained at 120 min was evaluated
after cutting with a roll glass cutter. An FTO layer of ∼1.5
μm thickness was observed on a glass substrate (Figure 1d). The precursor film self-assembled
with nanoplates with a thickness of ∼5 μm vertically
grew on the FTO layer to form a dense network structure. Under different
annealing gases of oxygen and argon flow at a temperature of 200 °C
for 60 min, the SEM images are displayed in Figure 1e,f. After annealing treatment, a similar
morphology was observed for samples #O2 and #Ar, but sample
#O2 has sparse nanoplates and more voids (Figure 1e), and sample #Ar has thicker
nanoplates with a thickness of 500 nm (Figure 1f). The difference in the thickness needs
to be further studied.

min (#4). (d) Cross-sectional SEM morphologies of sample #3 on the

To characterize the crystalline
structure of the produced films,
the XRD patterns of three as-synthesized films under air-annealing
were recorded (Figure 2a,b). The XRD patterns presented in Figure 2a indicate the crystalline structure evolution
of the unannealed precursor films grown on an FTO substrate with various
reaction times: 120, 180, and 240 min. Generally, the diffraction
peaks of all of the precursor films in Figure 2a can be indexed as a orthorhombic phase
Cu(OH)2 according to JCPDS card no. 13-0420, along with
a marked asterisk of the FTO substrate. The (002) diffraction plane
at around 2θ = 34.1° is dominated by other diffraction
planes. The relatively high intensity of the latter designates a strong
preferential orientation of the [002] axis vertical to the FTO substrate.
On further increasing the reaction time to 240 min, narrowing and
enhancing intense of prominent peak at 2θ = 34.1° was clearly
observed, indicating that longer reaction time helps adatoms to reach
the favorite lattice position more easily and induces [002] orientation.
This evolution of structures is consistent with the SEM observation
of well-ordered nanoplates locally in parallel. In addition, the inset
in Figure 2a shows
light-blue Cu(OH)2 films on FTO substrates.9 After further calcination under air gas flow, the Cu(OH)2 phase gradually disappeared and some new peaks of CuO (JCPDS
card no. 45-0937) appeared, indicating the conversion of Cu(OH)2 into CuO, as shown in Figure 2b. A comparison of the optical image of films through
air calcination is shown in the inset of Figure 2b. The films’ color eventually turns
dark, indicating that the pure Cu(OH)2 films were gradually
converted into CuO.

TEM images of the single as-synthesized
nanoplate and that after
air calcination are shown in Figure 2c,d, respectively. Figure 2c shows the TEM image and selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset) for the precursor films of Cu(OH)2 prepared with 3 h reaction time. The clear SAED patterns
reveal the good crystallization of the precursor nanoplate. The crystal
lattice fringes at spacings of 0.25 and 0.26 nm were assigned to the
(111) and (002) planes of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2, respectively. Figure 2d displays the TEM
image of a single CuO nanoplate of sample #3. The lattice fringes
between two planes were calculated to be 0.23 and 0.25 nm, which correspond
to the (111) and (002) planes of CuO (JCPDS card no. 45-0937). The
formation process of vertically aligned CuO film is displayed in Figure 2e.

The precursor
films of Cu(OH)2 prepared with 3 h reaction
time were then annealed at 200 °C with 60 min under air (#air),
argon (#Ar), and oxygen (#O2) gas atmospheres. The XRD
patterns are displayed in Figure 3a, which are identical. UV–vis–NIR absorption
spectra were recorded to explore the difference in the absorption
for the prepared samples #air, #O2, and #Ar, as shown in Figure 3b, where sample #air
has a stronger absorption from 400 to 1200 nm than those under oxygen
and argon atmosphere calcining treatment. The difference in absorbance
can be explained as a result of the different morphologies, as shown
in Figure 1. Sample
#air is composed of thinner nanoplates and has more specific surface
areas than the two others, conducive to high-efficiency light harvesting,3,10 where the electrochemical specific surface area will be discussed
in the following measurements. And an absorption onset can be observed
at ∼946.6 nm for sample #air, and ∼961 nm for samples
#Ar and #O2. The absorption spectra of samples #air, #O2, and #Ar can be extracted from the formula (αhν)n = c(hν – Eg), where c is a constant, Eg is the band gap, and n is the exponent, which is equal to 2 or 1/2, for direct or indirect transitions,
respectively. The band gaps for the direct transition were estimated
from a plot of (αhν)2 versus
photon energy hν, whose values
are equal to 1.31, 1.29, and 1.29 eV for samples #air, #O2, and #Ar, respectively.4

(f).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements of Cu 2p and
O 1s spectra for samples #air, # O2, and #air were carried
out as shown in Figure 3c,d. For Cu 2p, the typical peaks were observed at 933.4 and 953.4
eV for three samples, which correspond to Cu 2p3/2 and
Cu 2p1/2 peaks of Cu2+, indicating the formation
of CuO.11,12 For O 1s, the peak at 530 eV can be deconvolved
into three peaks O1, O2, and O3, as shown in Figure 3e,f. The O 1s spectra exhibit three strong
peaks, labeled as “O1”, “O2”, and “O3”,
with respective binding energies equal to ∼529.6, 531.2, and
532.4 eV, as shown in Table 1. Peaks O1 and O2 were ascribed to the “O2–” ions of the crystalline network (Cu–O) and subsurface
“O–” species, respectively.13,14 And peak O2 was also ascribed to the localized oxygen at the sites
of nanoparticles’ contact in the interunit space.15 The higher peak (O3) is regarded as oxygen atoms
chemisorbed/adsorbed at the surface.16,17 The fitting
shows that the ratio of “O2–” ions
(O1) of the crystalline network (Cu–O) to the total integrated
intensity of sample #air is the highest, the lowest is for the sample
#Ar; peak O2 of sample #Ar is the largest; and the oxygen atoms chemisorbed/adsorbed
at the surface for sample #O2 is the largest. More localized
oxygen at the nanoparticles’ contact sites will result in a
trapping center, which will lower the carrier concentration.

PEC Properties
The measurement of
the self-powered
PEC-type detector was carried out by using Ag/AgCl as a reference
electrode in saturated KCl, Pt wire as a counter electrode, and CuO
films grown on the FTO substrate as an active photocathode, as shown
in Scheme 1. Here,
the incident light source was an LED irradiation using continuous
visible light (564 ± 60 nm) pulse with an on–off interval
of 20 s at different intensities.

Scheme 1 Schematic Device Structure of the
CuO Nanoplates PEC-Type Detector
Samples #2, #3, and #4 h were used as the active photocathode
in
PEC under on/off of 20 s at 0.0 V vs Ag/AgCl with illumination of
564 ± 60 nm 120 mW/cm2 incident intensity, and the
maximal photocurrent observed was ∼120 μA for sample
#3 (or sample #air), as shown in Figure 4a. The photocurrent can keep up to 80% after
10 repeat cycles under on/off switching irradiation, and the maximal
photosensitivity (a ratio of photocurrent to dark current) is about
22 for sample #3 (Figure 4a), meaning that the photodetector has an excellent reproducible
and high photosensitive performance. After 10 circles, sample #3 has
the photocurrent of 96 μA, which is nearly 25% larger than the
value of 77 μA for samples #2 and #4.

#air, #O2, and #Ar as photocathode (b); transient decay
times (c); decaying edges (d); photocurrent response for different
incident intensities (e); and the relation between photocurrent I and incident intensity P,I ∝ Pθ, with θ = 0.59
(f).

To study the effects of calcining
atmosphere on the photocurrent,
samples #air, #O2, and #Ar were used as the active photocathode
in PEC under same conditions, and their corresponding photocurrents
are obtained as 120, 17.5, and 3.5 μA, as shown in Figure 4b. It shows that
sample #air has nearly 7 times enhancement in photocurrent compared
to sample #O2 and 34 times enhancement compared to sample
#Ar. Therefore, the calcining atmosphere has a great influence on
the photocurrent of CuO thin films. Figure 4c displays the transient decay times. Figure 4d shows the logarithmic
plots of the photocurrent transient decay D of samples
#air and #O2 without applied biases with the relation18D = (It – Is)/(Im – Is), where It is the current at time t, Is is the stabilized current, and Im is the current spike. Then, the transient decay time
τ, defined as the time at which ln D = −1, is obtained as 10.2 s for sample #air, while for sample
#O2, the transient decay time τ is hard to be extracted.
The longer τ means an enhanced charge separation efficiency
and prolonged carrier lifetimes.19 The
relationship between photocurrent (I) and incident
intensity (P) for sample #air was plotted, as shown
in Figure 4e,f. A value
of θ = 0.59 was extracted from the relation I ∝ Pθ. Nonlinear power θ
was regarded as the existence of the carrier traps on the CuO surface,
and the result is quite smaller than the θ (∼1) reported
by Hong et al.10 A typical overshot (spiked
cathodic pulses) in the photocurrent response with time was observed
obviously in Figure 4, which was explained as electron/hole recombination mediated by
the trap.20 As discussed in ref (21), an excited electron from
the conduction band will recombine with a hole from the valence band
at a trap state, inducing trap-assisted recombination. In our study,
we found that the electrochemical specific surface area of sample
#air is larger than that of samples #Ar and #O2, as shown
in Figure 5. This result
demonstrates that the improved photocurrent can be ascribed to the
increased specific surface.

for samples #Ar,
#air, and #O2.

Mechanism
Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were obtained
from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement for samples
#air, #O2, and #Ar, as shown in Figure 6a,b. From MS curves, the capacitance of the
space charge region, formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface,
is measured to determine the active concentration of dopants. The
MS equation is described by 1  where k,NA, C, and e are the
Boltzmann constant, hole carrier density, space charge capacitance
in the semiconductor, and elemental charge value, respectively. Parameters
ε and ε0 are the relative permittivity of the
semiconductor (ε of CuO is 10.26) and the permittivity of vacuum,
respectively. V and T are the applied
potential and temperature, respectively. The slope of the linear part
of the curve in the Mott–Schottky plot is negative from −0.2
to 0 V (Figure 6b),
indicating a p-type semiconductor, and the hole carrier density NA can be calculated from the following relation 2  and then
the acceptor concentrations are estimated
as 2.9 × 1021, 1.17 × 1021, and 7.75
× 1020 cm–3 for samples #air, #O2, and #Ar, respectively. The NA value of sample #air is more than 2 times larger than that of sample
#O2, and 37 times larger than that of sample #Ar. The changes
in the acceptor concentrations for three samples are consistent with
their photocurrent values, that is, the larger NA, the better photocurrent performance will be. While our result
is different from the one reported by Mallows et al.,22 who showed that the higher oxygen pressure effectively
increased the amount of nickel vacancies, leading to 1 order enhancement
in acceptor concentrations.

photoelectrode registered in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
(pH 7) for three samples #air, #O2, and #Ar (a, b); UPS
data (c) view of the secondary electron edge (SEE); and (d) view of
the valence band maximum (VBM) region.

UPS measurements were carried out to study the surface electron
behavior, as shown in Figure 6c,d, where Figure 6c is a view of the secondary electron edge (SEE) energy corresponding
to the left spectra in UPS data, and Figure 6d is a view of the valence band maximum (VBM)
region corresponding to the right spectra in UPS data. The work function
can be extracted from the left-hand side of the SEE spectra, which
is equal to ∼4.92 eV for samples #air and #O2, and
4.92 and 5.22 eV for sample #Ar, the former is corresponding to the
inner parts of CuO film and the latter to the surface. And the valence
band maximum energy can be obtained from Figure 6d, which is ∼0.44 eV for sample #air
and 0.55 eV for samples #O2 and #Ar. Then, the conduction
band and valence band (vs vacuum) can be obtained, as shown in Table 2. For example, the
conduction band is equal to 4.05 eV and the valence band is equal
to 5.36 eV (vs vacuum) for sample #air. As the minimal conduction
band energy of 4.05 eV (vs vacuum energy) is more positive than the
redox potential of H2O/H2 (4.44 V), photogenerated
electrons can thus be transferred to reduce water to hydrogen, as
shown in Scheme 2.
For sample #Ar, the inner part of CuO film has the same energy level
as the sample #O2; therefore, it has an ability to activate
reduction reaction. But for the surface of CuO film, the conduction
position of 4.48 eV (vs vacuum energy) is more negative than the redox
potential of H2O/H2 (4.44 eV), and the photogenerated
electrons cannot be transferred to reduce water to hydrogen; furthermore,
the inner part has only fewer CuO nanoparticles to contact with electrolyte
(H2O), resulting in a decrease in the photocurrent performance.
Therefore, the photocurrent of #Ar is much lower than that of #air.

When the CuO layer was deposited
on the FTO substrate, a depletion
region formed on both the FTO and CuO sides by carrier diffusion under
thermal equilibrium conditions, leading to the formation of a built-in
electric field near the CuO/FTO interface. At the CuO/electrolyte
interface, p-type semiconductor CuO with a carrier density of ∼2.9
× 1021 cm–3 contacts the aqueous
side, and the amount of holes will accumulate on the CuO side, and
electrons on the aqueous side. Hole carriers will capture OH– adsorbed on the CuO film to form hydroxyl radicals OH• (h+ + OH– → OH•), until stabilized and built-in field is formed. Similar to the
discussion in ref (23), CuO active layer under visible light illumination will generate
electron–hole pairs, and the electron–hole pairs will
be separated by the internal built-in potential formed at the CuO/electrolyte
interface, where the electrons from the conduction band of CuO will
reduce the hydroxyl radicals OH• to OH– anions (e– + OH• → OH–) at the CuO/electrolyte interface, thereupon the separated
holes move from the CuO valence band through the FTO into the external
circuit and then come back to the Pt layer. In this manner, the circuit
has been completed. In ref (13), the authors found that the photocurrent is annealing temperature-dependent,
where CuO film under a higher annealing temperature revealed an enhanced
photocurrent because of the improved film crystallinity. Here, the
air-annealed CuO film revealed an improved photocurrent performance
due to its fewer localized oxygen at the sites of contact of nanoparticle
and strong light absorption.

Conclusions
CuO
films on FTO substrate were prepared and annealed at air, oxygen,
and argon flow atmospheres. All of the CuO films are composed of vertically
arrayed CuO nanosheets, each individual nanosheet with a thickness
of 100–500 nm. The prepared samples were used as photocathodes
in the photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) to study the changes of the
photocurrent performance. Those hierarchical CuO photoelectrodes in
the PEC exhibit quite different photoelectrochemical performance in
visible light, as the annealed CuO films under air, oxygen, and argon
atmospheres have photocurrents of 120, 17.5, and 3.5 μA, respectively.
And an acceptor concentration of 2.9 × 1021 cm–3 was obtained for sample #air from the Mott–Schottky
analysis, which is more than 2 times larger than that of #O2, and 37 times larger than that of Ar. XPS and UPS measurements showed
that more localized oxygen at the sites of nanoparticles’ contact
resulted in a decrease in the carrier concentration and a decrease
in the Fermi level. At the same time, sample #air can absorb more
light. Therefore, high carrier concentration and strong light absorption
determined the improved photocurrent performance. In addition to the
annealing temperature, different annealing atmosphere gases are also
important for the properties of the oxide semiconductors. The results
obtained in this paper may be helpful to the preparations and application
of nano-oxide semiconductors.
