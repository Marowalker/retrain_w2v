A stable 2D terbium oxalatophosphonate
with green luminescence,
namely, [Tb2(H3L)(C2O4)3(H2O)4]·2H2O (1), has been hydrothermally obtained by using (4-carboxypiperidyl)-N-methylenephosphonic acid (H3L) and oxalate
ligand. The luminescent investigation indicates that the emission
behavior of compound 1 shows high water and pH stabilities.
It can be applied as a multiresponsive luminescent probe with high
selectivity, high sensitivity, recycling capability, and fast sensing
of CrO42–, Cr2O72– anions and tryptophan (Trp)
molecules in aqueous solution through the luminescence quenching effect.
Moreover, the sensing results can be distinguished by the naked eye
under the irradiation of UV light of 254 nm. In addition, the probable
mechanisms for the quenching behavior are also discussed, which can
be mainly attributed to the competitive absorption of excitation energy
between compound 1 and the analytes.

Introduction
In recent years, luminescent
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
as a new type of sensor have attracted a great deal of interest because
of their distinct advantages such as intense and visible emission
by the naked eye, simplicity in operation, and high sensitivity and
selectivity.1−5 A variety of luminescent MOFs have been explored for sensing of
different cations,6−10 anions,11−17 temperature,18 organic molecules,19−25 and nitroaromatic explosives.26−28

CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions serve
as oxidants, playing a crucial
role in industry.29 Meanwhile, they are
also toxic and easily soluble in water. Long-term exposure to these
substances can result in pulmonary congestion, skin allergy, and several
water-borne diseases.30,31 Therefore, it is very important
and urgently required to develop luminescent sensors for CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions with high selectivity and sensitivity.13−17,32−36 However, some reported luminescent MOFs for detecting those ions
are in nonaqueous solvents.15,32−35 The use of an organic solvent is disadvantageous for health and
environmental protection. In addition, as there are more than one
type of pollutant ions in waste water, high selective sensing is very
important. However, the corresponding reports are rare.14,16 Thus, it remains a challenge to construct luminescent MOFs as probes
to detect CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions in water, simultaneously, especially
for excluding the interference of other mixed anions.

As is
known, as the building blocks of proteins and enzymes, amino
acids play vital roles in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.37,38 Among them, tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid and plays
an important part in various physiological processes such as protein
biosynthesis, animal growth, and plant development.39 An abnormal level of Trp is considered as a strong indicator
for some diseases, including pellagra, delusions, chronic hepatitis,
and parkinsonism.40 At present, the most
used analytical strategies to detect Trp are based on capillary electrophoresis,
gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, UV–vis
spectrophotometry, and electrochemical methods.41 However, there are many drawbacks in these methods, such
as high costs, complicated operation, and poor portability, which
limit their widespread applications. Therefore, the development of
cheap and easy detective methods for rapid and sensitive detection
of Trp is still more imminently needed. Fortunately, luminescent MOF
sensors can provide an alternative to solve these problems. However,
compared to the ones for sensing ions and molecules,6−17,19−28 only a few investigations were reported for detecting Trp based
on luminescent MOFs and coordination polymers,42−44 which did not
achieve the visible sensor by the naked eye. Hence, it is very important
and urgent from the point of view of security and practical considerations
to exploit the luminescent sensors for Trp.

In order to achieve
the aims, we focus on the construction of the
lanthanide luminescent MOFs (Ln-MOFs). Compared with transition-metal-based
luminescent MOFs, Ln-MOFs have been regarded as very promising luminescent-sensing
materials because of their distinct optical advantages, such as large
Stokes shift, high color purity, relatively long luminescent lifetimes,
visible and very bright luminescent colors, especially for Eu- and
Tb-MOFs.45−49 In previous reports, some Ln-MOFs have been made for the luminescent
sensor; however, very few Ln-MOFs could be observed to show multiresponsive
luminescent sensing for different analytes.32,33,50,51 In the assembly
of structures and functions of Ln-MOFs, the choice of the organic
ligand is very vital. Traditionally, organic carboxylic acid was mainly
selected as the ligand to construct Ln-MOFs.45−49 Recently, the phosphonate ligands, especially, attaching
additional functional groups to the phosphonic acid (such as −NH2, −OH, −COOH, etc.), can also provide access
to obtain Ln-MOFs. Compared with carboxylates, the introduction of
the phosphonate groups can yield many different structural topologies
and a fascinating luminescent property.52,53 Moreover,
the uncoordinated functional groups can also serve as the recognition
site to achieve luminescent detection. More importantly, metal phosphonates
are generally prepared in hydrothermal conditions. Therefore, the
as-synthesized compounds can exhibit high thermal and chemical stabilities,54 providing a chance to detect the analytes in
the aqueous system. For example, several Cd/Pb phosphonates have been
investigated in the detection of metal ions, anions, and amino acids
by our group.43,55,56 However, these sensors cannot achieve visible sensors because of
the near UV luminescent emission. The introduction of luminescent
lanthanide ions can solve this problem. Fu et al. prepared a luminescent
terbium phosphonate, which achieved a rapid and selective sensor of
nitroaromatic explosives with a low detection limit (LOD; 66 ppb).57 Yang et al. reported two terbium phosphonates
that served as the luminescent probe to detect metal ions in aqueous
solution.58 Though a few luminescent lanthanide
phosphonates have been reported recently, there are still no reports
for simultaneously detecting chromate anions and Trp. Therefore, it
is still a challenge to achieve multiresponsive and visible luminescent
sensing for different ions and molecules based on these materials.
Meanwhile, the preparation and characterization of lanthanide phosphonates
is still difficult because these materials generally exhibit high
insolubility and poor crystallinity.57,59 To resolve
this problem, two types of synthetic strategies were employed: (1)
modifying the phosphonic acid ligand with other functional groups
can improve the solubility and crystallinity of these materials.59,60 (2) Introducing a second metal linker such as an organic carboxylic
acid is also one of the effective approaches.61 It can not only solve the solubility and crystallinity problems
but also enhance luminescent intensity and lifetime of the synthesized
lanthanide phosphonates through the so-called “antenna effect”.
By using these methods, more and more lanthanide phosphonates with
luminescent property have been successfully obtained.57,59−62 As an expansion of our work, by using H2O3PCH2–NC5H9–COOH (H3L) as the phosphonate ligand and oxalate (H2C2O4) as the second ligand, we successfully obtained
a 2D terbium oxalatophosphonate, namely, [Tb2(H3L)(C2O4)3(H2O)4]·2H2O (1). It shows high selective,
visible, and recyclable sensing of CrO42–, Cr2O72– anions and Trp.
Meanwhile, the probable mechanisms for the quenching behavior are
also discussed.

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure of 1
X-ray crystallographic
analysis indicated that compound 1 crystallized in a
monoclinic space group P2(1)/n (Table S1). The crystal structure consists
of two TbIII ions, one H3L ligand, three C2O42– anions, four coordinated
water molecules, and two lattice water molecules (Figure 1a). The Tb1 ion adopts a nine-coordinated
geometry with six oxygen atoms (O6, O7, O10, O11, O14, and O15) from
three C2O42– anions, one phosphonate
oxygen atom (O2) from one H3L ligand, and two coordinated
water molecules (O18 and O19). The Tb2 ion employs an eight-coordinated
environment, consisting of six oxygen atoms (O8A, O9A, O12B, O13B,
O16, and O17) from three C2O42– anions and two coordinated water molecules (O20 and O21). Bond distances
of Tb–O are in the range of 2.260(4)–2.616(4) Å,
in accordance with those reported for other TbIII oxalatophosphonates
(Table S2).63 Using the program SHAPE 2.0,64,65 the continuous shape
measures (CShMs) of the Tb centers relative to the ideal spherical
capped square antiprism for Tb1 and triangular dodecahedron for Tb2
are calculated to be 0.778 and 0.874, respectively. All C2O42– anions employ the same coordination
mode, chelating to two TbIII ions forming two stable five-membered
rings (Tb–O–C–C–O). On the basis of charge
balances, the phosphonate oxygen atom (O1), the nitrogen atom (N1),
and the carboxyl oxygen atom (O5) of the H3L ligand are
protonated.

In compound 1, the
interconnection of TbIII ions via cheating C2O42– anions to form a 2D layer structure
(Figure 1b). The carboxyl
groups of the H3L ligand are uncoordinated, distributing
on the two sides of the
layer (Figure S1). A 24-atom window is
formed, including six TbIII ions, twelve O atoms, and six
C atoms, and the approximate dimension is 5.97 Å (O11–O12)
× 9.02 Å (O14–O15) (Figure 1c). From a topological perspective, each
TbIII ion can be regarded as a three-connected node; thus,
the 2D layer structure can be simplified as a uninodal three-connected
network with the point Schläfli symbol of {6̂3} (Figure 1d).

Luminescence
Property
The luminescence spectrum of
compound 1 was investigated in the solid state. First,
the purity of bulk samples of compound 1 was verified
by X-ray powder diffraction (Figure S2).
Second, the UV–vis absorption spectrum of compound 1 consists of a broad band between 200 and 600 nm with a maximum absorption
of 256 nm (Figure S3). The broad band may
be assigned to the synergetic effect of TbIII–O
charge transfer transition and the 4f8 → 4f75d1 transition of the TbIII ion.66 The central maximum absorption strongly depends
on the crystal field of the host matrix because of the low shielding
of the 5d orbital.66 On the basis of the
UV–vis absorption spectrum of compound 1, a 254
nm light was selected to induce the luminescent emission. Compound 1 shows four emission peaks at 491, 547, 587, and 623 nm,
contributing to the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of the TbIII ion (Figure 2). Among them, the 5D4 → 7F5 transition is the strongest, which is assigned
to magnetic-dipole-induced transitions. The room temperature lifetime
of the TbIII ion in the 5D4 → 7F5 transition
is measured to be 0.85 ms (Figure S4).
Compound 1 displays strong green luminescence under UV
irradiation of 254 nm (in the inset of Figure 2), which is visible by the naked eye. The
strong visible emission provides the possibility for compound 1 acting as a luminescent sensor.

at room temperature. Inset: Fluorescent images under UV irradiation
(λex = 254 nm).

Thermal and Chemical Stabilities
Considering practical
applications, the physical and chemical stabilities of compound 1 were investigated. First, the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) indicates that all water molecules are removed upon heating
to 167 °C; the resulting desolvated structure is stable up to
234 °C (Figure S5). Second, we examined
the aqueous and pH stabilities of compound 1 in water.
The luminescent intensities of this sample have almost no change after
soaking in the water solution for 10 days or immersing into water
solutions with different pH values from 3 to 13 for 24 h (Figures 3 and S6). In addition, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns of the different pH-treated samples (pH = 3–13) completely
overlap that of the simulated one (Figure S7), indicating that the framework is still retentive in a broad range
of pH values. The results of thermal, luminescent, pH, and water stabilities
indicate that compound 1 is stable and provides a suitable
platform for further luminescent sensing.

compound 1; the simulated, as-synthesized
product, stayed in air for 1 month and immersed in water for 10 days.
(b) Fluorescence measurements of compound 1 after treatment
with different pH values in aqueous solutions.

Sensing of Anions
Compound 1 was first
examined for the potential application of detecting anions. As shown
in Figures 4a and S8, results indicate that CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions afford significant luminescence quenching effect compared
with other anions. It reveals that most suspensions display green
color, except for CrO42– and Cr2O72– suspensions that show dark color
upon excitation at 254 nm (Figure 4b). Meanwhile, anti-interference experiments were carried
out to verify the high selectivity for detection of CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions (Figure 4c).
First, the mixture of anion suspensions except CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions was prepared, which shows green luminescence. Once CrO42– or Cr2O72– anions were added into the above suspension of compound 1 with other anions, the luminescence of suspension was significantly
quenched from green to dark. The above results indicate that compound 1 can be regarded as a selective and sensitive luminescent
sensor for detecting the CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions.

for compound 1, blank, add other mixed anions, and CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions. Inset:

The sensing sensitivities of compound 1 toward CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions were measured by a series
of titration experiments. As shown
in Figure 5a,c, the
luminescence intensities are gradually quenched, and the quenching
efficiency can reach 78.9% for CrO42– and 82.7% for Cr2O72– anions
as the concentration increases to 4.4 × 10–4 M for CrO42– and 3.3 × 10–4 M for Cr2O72– anions. To further investigate the relationship between the quenching
efficiency and CrO42– or Cr2O72– concentration, the quenching curve
was analyzed by the Stern–Volmer equation I0/I = Ksv[C] + 1 (I0 and I are
the luminescence intensities before and after the addition of CrO42– or Cr2O72– anions, respectively; [C] represents the molar concentration of
CrO42– or Cr2O72– anions; Ksv is the
quenching constant). As shown in Figure 5b,d, the curves of Stern–Volmer display
a good linear relationship at a low concentration, and the Ksv values are fitted to be 3.63 × 103 M–1 for CrO42– and 7.78 × 103 M–1 for Cr2O72– anions. The LODs are calculated
to be 3.7 μM for CrO42– and 4.2
μM for Cr2O72– anions
(Figure S9), which are calculated using
the equation: LOD = 3δ/S (δ is the standard
deviation from 10 blank measurements and S is the
slope of the calibration curve).15,16,51 Compared with the reported MOFs sensors for CrVI anions, this LOD is comparable and even lower (Table S3).13−17,32−36 Furthermore, the LODs are lower, comparing with the
largest standard of CrVI in wastewater of 10 μM,
defined by an integrated wastewater discharge standard of China.67 As is known, the luminescent sensors are not
widely used in our actual life mainly because of their non-recoverable
performance and high cost; thus, recyclable experiments were performed.
After quenching, the luminescence intensity of compound 1 can recover by simply washing with water several times (Figure S10). As shown in Figure S11, the luminescence intensity of each recycle remains
basically unchanged. Furthermore, the time of luminescence intensity
reaching the minimum value is estimated to be within 10 s with the
addition of CrO42– or Cr2O72– anions (Figure S12), which is obviously shorter than those of previously reported compounds
(Table S3).13,15 The results
indicate that compound 1 can realize the fast and recyclable
luminescent sensor for detecting CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions.

at different concentrations in aqueous solutions (excited
at 254 nm), and the Stern–Volmer plots of CrO42– (b) and Cr2O72– (d) anions.

The mechanisms of detecting
CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions were
also explored. PXRD patterns of compound 1 treated with
different anions completely overlap those of the simulated one, ruling
out the mechanism of collapse of the crystal structure (Figure S13). The solid particles of compound 1 with chromate anions were analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP). The ICP results verify that the chromate anions in solution
cannot be fixed into the channels of compound 1 (Table S4). In addition, the Cr peaks have not
been observed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the sample
treated with the chromate anion aqueous solution, which also further
identifies that chromate anions do not combine with compound 1 (Figure S14). On the basis of
these results, there are no direct interactions between the chromate
anions and compound 1, which is not the primary factor
in fluorescence quenching. The UV–vis absorption spectra of
compound 1 and anions are shown in Figure S15. It is obvious that the absorption bands of CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions are partly overlapped by the absorption band of compound 1; however, other anions have no obvious overlaps in the absorption
range. Thus, CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions can absorb the excitation
energy and then hinder the absorption of compound 1,
resulting in the decrease of the luminescence intensity. Therefore,
the probable mechanisms for the quenching behavior can be mainly defined
to the competitive absorption of excitation energy between compound 1 and CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions, which accords with the
previously reported compounds that sensing of the CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions.13,51

Sensing of Amino Acids
To further
explore the potential
application of compound 1 for detecting the amino acid
molecules, the luminescence spectra were recorded with the addition
of 20 different kinds of amino acids. As shown in Figures 6a and S16, different amino acids exhibit different quenching efficiencies
toward the intensity of compound 1. Among them, Trp has
a significant quenching effect. As shown in Figure 6b, the suspension with Trp displays an evident
blue color, but the suspensions with other amino acids show bright
green color upon excitation at 254 nm. Meanwhile, anti-interference
experiments further prove that compound 1 has good selectivity
for detecting Trp even in the presence of other amino acids (Figure 6c). The luminescence
intensity is significantly quenched with the addition of Trp, which
indicates that compound 1 can serve as a selective and
sensitive luminescent probe for detecting Trp.

at 547 nm for compound 1 dispersed
in different amino acid solutions upon excitation at 254 nm. (b) Corresponding
photographs for different amino acid aqueous solutions under irradiation

photographs under irradiation of 254 nm UV light. Emission spectra
of compound 1 with Trp (d) at different concentrations
in aqueous solution (excited at 254 nm), and the Stern–Volmer
plots of Trp (e).

To check the selective
sensing behavior of compound 1 toward Trp, titration
experiments were performed. As anticipated,
the luminescence intensity gradually decreases with increasing concentration
of Trp (Figure 6d).
The quenching efficiency reaches 95.4% with the concentration of Trp
increasing to 2.5 × 10–3 M. At a low concentration,
the plot of Stern–Volmer shows a good line relationship, and
the Ksv is calculated to be 3.86 ×
103 M–1 (Figure 6e). The LOD value is estimated to be 25.2
μm (Figure S17). In addition, the
luminescence intensity of each recycle can be recovered, indicating
that it is a recyclable luminescent sensor for Trp (Figures S18 and S19). Meanwhile, the luminescence can also
reach the most quenching efficiency within 10 s with the addition
of Trp (Figure S20). To the best of our
knowledge, compound 1 is the first metal phosphonate
that can be used for the visible, fast, and recyclable luminescent
probe for sensing Trp.

To date, the reasons for luminescent
quenching caused by Trp may
be due to three approaches: (1) weak intermolecular interactions (hydrogen
bonds and/or π–π interactions); (2) chemical reaction
between Trp and the parent compound; (3) resonance energy transfer.37,42−44 In compound 1, the carboxyl oxygen atom
of the H3L ligand is not coordinated, making it possible
to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between compound 1 and Trp. However, all of the amino acid molecules have the same
access to form hydrogen bonds with the uncoordinated carboxyl groups;
thus, it is difficult to conclude whether the hydrogen bond interaction
is the main reason for the luminescence quenching. In addition, there
is no π–π interaction site in compound 1; the mechanism of π–π interactions can be ruled
out. IR spectra of compound 1 have no changes before
and after being immersed in Trp solution, indicating no chemical reaction
between Trp and compound 1 (Figure S21). The UV–vis absorption spectra of compound 1 and amino acids are shown in Figure S22. Lys, Tyr, and Trp all show a wide absorption band in the
absorption range of compound 1. Among them, Trp has the
highest absorption intensity; thus, it can adsorb the most excitation
energy and results in the strongest luminescence quenching. According
to the above discussion, it can be speculated that competitive adsorption
of excitation energy between compound 1 and Trp should
be the main reason for the luminescence quenching.

Conclusions
In summary, a stable 2D terbium oxalatophosphonate with green emission
has been prepared via hydrothermal reaction. This compound can be
regarded as a high selectivity and sensitivity luminescent sensor
for detecting the CrO42–, Cr2O72– anions and Trp through the luminescence
quenching effect. Further study and speculation of the mechanism indicate
that competitive adsorption of excitation energy between compound 1 and the analytes should be the main reason for the luminescence
quenching. To the best of our knowledge, it is first observed that
compound 1 can be used for the fast and recyclable luminescent
probe for detecting Trp by the naked eye in metal phosphonates. This
work has confirmed that luminescent metal phosphonates can be rationally
designed to achieve multiresponsive luminescent sensors for detecting
different ions and biomolecules.
