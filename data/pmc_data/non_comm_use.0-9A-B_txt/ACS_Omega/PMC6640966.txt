Lithium alloys are synthesized by
reactions between lithium metal
and group 14 elements, such as carbon, silicon, germanium, and tin.
The nitrogenation and denitrogenation properties are investigated
by thermal and structural analyses. All alloys dissociate the nitrogen
triple bond of gaseous molecules to form atomic state as nitrides
below 500 °C, which is lower than those required for conventional
thermochemical and catalytic processes on nitride syntheses. For all
alloys except for germanium, it is indicated that nanosized lithium
nitride is formed as the product. The denitrogenation (nitrogen desorption)
reaction by lithium nitride and metals, which is an ideal opposite
reaction of nitrogenation, occurs by heating up to 600 °C to
form lithium alloys. Among them, the lithium–tin alloy is a
potential material to control the dissociation and recombination of
nitrogen below 500 °C by the reversible reaction with the largest
amount of utilizable lithium in the alloy phase. The nitrogenation
and denitrogenation reactions of the lithium alloys at lower temperature
are realized by the high reactivity with nitrogen and mobility of
lithium. The above reactions based on lithium alloys are adapted to
the ammonia synthesis. As a result, ammonia can be synthesized below
500 °C under 0.5 MPa of pressure. Therefore, the reaction using
lithium alloys is recognized as a pseudocatalyst for the ammonia synthesis.

==== Body
Introduction
Nitrogen (N) is an
abundant element on the earth, where N2 gas is approximately
78% of the air. Some nitrides are known as
functional materials and practically used in various kinds of fields.
For instance, gallium nitride (GaN) is typical as a material for blue-light-emitting
diodes. To directly synthesize the nitrides from N2 gas,
extreme conditions such as temperature more than 800 °C and/or
use of plasma are necessary to dissociate N2.1−5 This is because N2 molecules have very stable triple
bonds (N≡N) with 945 kJ mol–1 of bond energy.6 Thus, ammonia (NH3) is often used
for nitride syntheses because the atomic N in NH3 molecules
is useful as nitrogen sources because of the weaker bond energy, 389
kJ mol–1.7 Moreover,
NH3 permits milder conditions than those of conventional
synthesis methods. On the other hand, NH3 should be produced
from N2 and H2 gases. Even though this reaction
is thermodynamically exothermic, effective catalysts are necessary
for the dissociation of N2. For the Haber–Bosch
process, known as the mass production technique for NH3, the iron-based catalyst is utilized, and various kinds of metal
catalysts are studied.8−11 Recently, electrides are proposed as a novel promoter for ruthenium
(Ru) catalyst.12,13 It is pointed out that the electron-donating
behavior plays an important role in the dissociation of the nitrogen
triple bond. From the above facts, it is concluded that an important
factor for synthesizing nitrides is the dissociation of N2.

Lithium (Li) metal easily reacts with N2 to form
lithium
nitride (Li3N) at a relatively lower temperature than the
above cases, where the required temperature is 50–400 °C,14−16 suggesting that metallic Li possesses high reactivity to dissociate
N2. However, Li3N is a thermodynamically stable
material (enthalpy change of the reaction ΔH = −165 kJ mol–1) and difficult to be used
as nitrogen sources.17 To control the dissociation
of N2 and utilize the N atoms under moderate conditions,
we have focused on the reaction using Li alloys. It is expected that
Li in the alloys takes the metal state because the chemical shift
of Li atoms in the Li-intercalated graphite observed by nuclear magnetic
resonance is around 40 ppm (for Li metal, it is more than 200 ppm);
such a significantly larger value compared with that of ionic compounds
is sometimes called the Knight shift.18,19 Therefore,
it is expected that the dissociation properties of Li are available
even in the case of alloys. Here, the Li alloys reversibly absorb
and desorb hydrogen (H2) by the following reaction20−24 1  where M is thought to be a group 14 element,
such as carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn). For
the hydrogen absorption reaction of LixC, Li atoms in the alloys react with H2 under a pressure
of 3 MPa at 100–200 °C to form lithium hydride (LiH),
although the temperature required for the hydrogenation of Li is more
than 600 °C. It is indicated that Li in LixC is more reactive than Li, resulting in mild reaction conditions.
LiH is stable because the temperature necessary for its decomposition
is more than 650 °C. However, the reaction between C and LiH
occurs at 100–200 °C, and then H2 is released
along with the LixC formation.21 Similar phenomena are shown for the other Li
alloys.24 Thus, the dissociation and recombination
of H2 are realized under much more mild conditions by the
reaction of Li alloys. It is expected that the above phenomena originated
from the high reactivity with H2 and the high mobility
of Li in the alloys.

On the basis of the reactions with H2, in this work,
Li alloys are used for the reaction with N2 as follows 2  The N2 dissociation (absorption)
and recombination (desorption) properties of the various Li alloys
are systematically investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility as a
pseudocatalytic reaction for the nitride formation is also examined
and discussed.

Results and Discussion
Nitrogenation
To investigate the N2 dissociation
properties on the surface of the Li–M (M = C, Si, Ge, and Sn)
alloys, the samples were heated up to 500 °C under N2 pressures. Figure 1a shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles for
the reactions between the Li–M alloys and 0.1 MPa of N2 gas. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns before and after
the DSC measurements are shown in Figure 1b. For the Li–C alloy, a broad exothermic
peak was observed in the temperature range 300–400 °C,
indicating that nitrogenation gradually occurred. A sharp endothermic
peak appeared at around 450 °C. This reaction corresponds to
a structural phase transition of lithium carbide (Li2C2)21 because exothermic peak was
also observed at the same temperature range in the cooling process.
It can be suggested that Li2C2 phase is partially
formed by the reaction of Li with fractions of nanosized or amorphous
carbons generated during the mechanical milling process. The diffraction
peaks observed for the as-synthesized Li–C alloy were assigned
mainly to the LiC12 phase, and small peaks corresponding
to LiC6 were also observed. After the reaction with N2, the diffraction peaks were shifted to the higher angle and
corresponding to graphite, where this is a typical variation due to
a decrease in the interlayer distance because of the deintercalation
of Li from LiC12. Assuming that LiC12 completely
reacted to N2 to form graphite and Li3N by the
following reaction, the reaction yield was estimated from the weight
gain by the nitrogenation to be 194% (see Table S1) 3  The yield in excess of 100% would be caused
by the existence of the high Li composition phase such as LiC6 in the as-synthesized sample. In fact, the weak diffraction
peak corresponding to LiC6 was observed around 24°
in Figure 1b as a shoulderlike
structure with the main peak of LiC12. Although the above
results indicated that the Li atoms located into the layers of graphite
reacted with N2 to form Li3N and graphite, Li3N was not observed in the XRD measurements. This phenomenon
would be caused by following reasons. In the case of LiC12, the Li amount is essentially small because of the 1:12 composition
for Li:C, and the Li3N generated from LiC12 is
expected to be possibly nanosized or amorphous states. Here, the nitrogenation
and XRD results obtained by the reaction with 3 MPa of N2 were similar to those under 0.1 MPa (see Figures S1 and S2), namely, the kinetics for the nitrogenation reaction
of Li–C alloy is not strongly affected by the nitrogen pressure.
To identify and characterize the nanosized or amorphous products,
transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements and energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out. Here, electron diffraction
measurements were also recorded; however, the useful information to
confirm the Li3N was not obtained. Figure 1 (a) DSC profiles of the
Li alloys under 0.1 MPa of N2 and (b) XRD patterns of as-synthesized
alloys and products after
the reaction with N2.

Figure 2 shows
TEM images of each Li–M alloy after the nitrogenation.
In the case of LiC12, no clear contrast to distinguish
products from the starting material was found as shown in Figure 2a. This result is
caused by the low content of Li in LiC12 and small difference
in electron numbers between C and N; in other words, it is difficult
to find and distinguish the products if Li3N or other nitrides
are formed. The EDS measurements were carried out at some spots in
the particles. However, it was also difficult to distinguish the products
and alloys because the energies of characteristic X-rays from C and
N are very close.

and (d) Li–Sn alloys after the reaction with N2 and
EDS spectra for (e) Li–Si and (f) Li–Sn alloys at the
spots shown by circles in each TEM image.

From the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Li–Si alloy
in Figure 1b, the formation
of Li22Si5 was clarified. A clear exothermic
peak was observed around 300 °C for the reaction of Li22Si5 with 0.1 MPa of N2 as shown in Figure 1a. Moreover, a gradual
exothermic reaction proceeded from 450 °C. The Li–Si alloys
with lower Li composition such as Li13Si4 and
Li7Si3 were observed after the DSC measurement.
The small peak around 27–28° is possibly ascribed to Li3N; however, further investigation is required because the
peak number is not high enough for accurate phase determination. The
Li22Si5 phase was changed to Li13Si4 at 300 °C, and the Li7Si3 generation started from 450 °C, suggesting that Li7Si3 was the final product at 500 °C. Here, the above
reactions occurred at lower temperatures under 3 MPa of N2 pressure, and then only Li7Si3 phase was observed
in the XRD pattern after the reaction at 500 °C (see Figures S1 and S2). The weight gain due to the
reaction with N2 was almost consistent with the value expected
from the eqs 4 and 5. 4   5  

Figure 2b shows
representative TEM image of the Li–Si alloy after the nitrogenation.
The TEM image shows low contrast parts around the particle, which
would be the products with low electron number such as Li3N. In fact, the EDS results shown in Figure 2e indicated that Si was absent at the spot
I with low contrast. On the other hand, even at a similar low contrast
part, Si was observed, suggesting that determination of the product
distribution is difficult only from the contrasts of the TEM images.

The Li22Ge5 phase was obtained by the mechanical
alloying and then annealing process because the diffraction peaks
observed in the XRD pattern shown in Figure 1b were totally assigned to Li22Ge5. In the case of Ge alloy, the reaction with N2 under 0.1 MPa started from around 150 °C with a weak
exothermic peak as shown in Figure 1a. The other two exothermic peaks were more clearly
observed at temperatures higher than 350 °C. After the reaction
at 500 °C, the starting phase of Li22Ge5 remained, and Li7Ge2 and unknown phases were
generated. Because the Li22Ge5 phase disappears
after the reaction under 3 MPa of N2 (Figures S1 and S2), the remaining Li22Ge5 is caused by kinetic parameters. Although the Li composition in
the alloy was decreased by the reaction with N2, Li3N was not found like other alloys. It is possible that the
nanosized or amorphous Li3N and/or other nitride phases
such as ternary nitride (Li–Ge–N) are formed. In addition,
the reaction yield estimated by assumption for generating Li7Ge2 and Li3N as products was higher than 100%,
suggesting that the unexpected reaction possibly occurs as the main
reaction. The TEM image is shown in Figure 2c. Although Ge has a high atomic number compared
with those of Li and N, no clear difference in the contrast was observed.
When the expected nitrogenation reaction by eq 2 occurs, the products should be generated
around the particles because only Li with high mobility is diffused
from inside of alloys to the surface and forms Li3N. However,
considering the formation of other products such as ternary nitrides,
it is expected that the N atoms would be diffused into the Li–Ge
alloy. In this case, the contrast difference in TEM image should not
be clearly observed. In fact, the EDS spectra obtained at different
spots in the particles were almost the same. The above results indicate
that the Li–Ge alloy can dissociate and react with N2 with different reaction paths from the C and Si cases.

The
XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Li–Sn alloy corresponded
to the Li22Sn5 phase as shown in Figure 1b. In the DSC profile obtained
under 0.1 MPa of N2 shown in Figure 1a, multi-exothermic peaks were observed at
temperatures ranging widely from room temperature to 500 °C.
By the reaction with N2, Li22Sn5 was
converted into Li7Sn2 and Li13Sn5. It is expected that the nanosized Li3N is formed
as the reaction product because no other nitrides or unknown phases
are found. Li7Sn2 is an intermediate phase because
only this phase was observed at 360 °C (see Figure S6), and Li13Sn5 with a lower
Li composition would be the final product at 500 °C. From the
above results, it is concluded that the Sn system shows the lowest
starting temperature for the N2 dissociation, which is
almost the same as the room temperature, among the Li alloys. In the
case of Li–Sn alloy, no clear difference was found between
the experimental results under 0.1 and 3 MPa of N2 pressures
(see also Figures S1 and S2). 6  The weight gain estimated from the above equation
was close to the measured value (see Table S1). The clearest contrast and difference between the products and
starting alloy were noticed from the TEM image and the EDS spectra
as shown in Figure 2d,f, respectively. Here, it was difficult to analyze nitrogen using
EDS because the level of carbon and oxygen contamination was higher
than that of the products at the surface parts. The low contrast parts
observed around the particle included no Sn component, indicating
that these parts were products composed of Li and N atoms such as
Li3N. Here, by the electron diffraction measurement, some
diffraction spots corresponding to Li3N were observed.
However, the number of spots was not high enough for analysis to identify
the product. Figure 3 shows the TEM image of the other particle of Li–Sn alloy
after the nitrogenation and the high-magnification images of the product
parts. Some products formed nanotube and/or nanofibers. It is reported
that Li3N has a layered crystal structure, thereby possibly
forming the tubular and fibrous shapes as carbon.25 For the generation process of the product during the reaction,
further investigation is necessary to understand its mechanism. Figure 4 shows SEM and BS
images of the nitrogenated Li–Sn alloy. Although the observed
particle showed significant edges in the SEM image, some parts became
invisible in the case of the BS image. These results indicate that
the products are located at the surface of particle and possess lower
electron number than the Li–Sn alloy. The results obtained
by both TEM and SEM are well-consistent and indicate the possibility
of Li3N formation.

(BS) images of the Li–Sn alloy particle after the reaction

Denitrogenation
To utilize the dissociated and atomic
N in Li3N, the reverse reaction of eq 2 is important. The thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry
(TG-MS) measurements were recorded for the Li3N and M (M
= C, Si, Ge, and Sn) mixtures, which are ideal final products, to
investigate the properties of nitrogen desorption, which is named
as “denitrogenation”. Figure 5a shows the TG-MS profiles of the Li3N–M mixtures and (b) shows the XRD patterns of the
as-synthesized mixtures and products. The mass number 28 plotted in
the MS profiles corresponds to N2. Although a temperature
higher than 700 °C is thermodynamically necessary to decompose
Li3N into Li and N226 (see Figure S7), all mixtures showed
N2 desorption below 600 °C. The Li3N–C
mixture desorbed N2 in a broad temperature range of 100–400
°C with low intensity and only 2.0 wt % of weight loss. The reaction
yield is estimated to be 38%, assuming that the LiC6 is
completely generated. The diffraction peak corresponding to graphite
was broadened by the mechanical ball-milling and did not change after
the N2 desorption, suggesting that the reaction proceeded
with the generation of nanosized or amorphous Li–C alloys.
Here, a broad peak in the range of 15–35° is not essential
and should be caused by the grease and/or polyimide sheet.

Figure 5 (a) TG-MS profiles
of Li3N and M mixtures and (b) XRD
patterns of as-synthesized mixtures and products after the TG-MS measurements.

In the case of Si system, the
N2 desorption was clearly
observed from 350 °C. After the measurement at 600 °C, diffraction
peaks corresponding to Si disappeared, and the Li7Si3 phase was found to be the main product, where ternary nitride
(Li5N3Si) was possibly formed as the by-product.
The weight loss due to the reaction at 600 °C was 5.2 wt %. From
the weight loss value, the reaction yield is estimated to be 93%,
assuming that the following reaction occurred 7  

As shown in Figure 5b, no clear diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of
the as-synthesized Li3N and Ge mixture, suggesting that
both materials were changed to nanograins or amorphous phase during
the mechanical ball-milling process. The Li3N–Ge
mixture required a higher temperature to release N2 compared
with other mixtures. The N2 desorption was observed from
500 °C and continuously proceeded at more than 600 °C. To
complete the N2 desorption, the mixture was heat-treated
at 600 °C for 8 h under a dynamic vacuum condition using a batch
cell. The XRD patterns of the products obtained after the TG-MS measurement
and the heat treatment at 600 °C are shown in Figure 5b. After just heating up to
600 °C, the observed peaks were not assigned to any materials
in the database. On the other hand, Li2GeN2 was
formed by the heat treatment for 8 h, suggesting that the unknown
phase should be an intermediate phase and a precursor of the ternary
nitride.

In the case of Li3N and Sn mixture, nanosized
or amorphous
states were formed by the ball-milling as shown in Figure 5b. The N2 desorption
occurred in the temperature range of 400–600 °C with multiple
steps. Although it was difficult to distinguish each reaction process
because of the overlapping of the N2 desorption profiles,
the composition of Li and Sn was gradually changed with N2 desorption to form alloys with a higher Li composition (see Figure S11). At 600 °C, Li7Sn2 and Li22Sn5 were observed as the reaction
products. The Li7Sn2 phase would be the main
product at the conditions because 10.2 wt % of weight loss was smaller
than value estimated assuming that Li22Sn5 was
completely formed. From the MS profile, it is expected that the reaction
is not completed at 600 °C, indicating that the Li3N and Sn mixture is possibly changed to Li22Sn5 for longer reaction time or at slightly higher temperature. Therefore,
it is recognized that only the Li–Sn alloy is a potential material
to control the N2 dissociation and recombination with the
largest amount of utilizable Li below 600 °C as shown by the
following fully reversible reaction 8  

Generally, it is
expected that the reactions with phase separation
require high temperature because of the long diffusion distance of
atoms. However, Li is small and possesses the high mobility known
as reactions of lithium ion battery. Therefore, it is speculated that
the nitrogenation and denitrogenation reactions of the Li alloys at
lower temperatures would be realized by the high reactivity with N2 and mobility of Li.

The nitrogenation and denitrogenation
properties were investigated
using ideal starting materials—the Li–M alloys and mixtures
of Li3N and M prepared in this fundamental work. For practical
applications of the N2 dissociation and recombination processes
using the Li alloys, investigations of their cycle properties are
required.

Ammonia Synthesis
NH3 synthesis using the
nitrogenation and denitrogenation reactions of Li–M alloys
were investigated. Goshome et al. reported that NH3 can
be generated by the reaction between Li3N and H2 under flow conditions by the following equation27 9  If Li3N is formed by the reaction
of Li–M alloys with N2, NH3 should be
generated by the above reaction; in other words, NH3 generation
is indirect evidence for the existence of Li3N in the samples.
The DSC–MS measurements of the nitrogenated Li–M alloys
were recorded under 0.5 MPa of H2 flow conditions, and
the results are shown in Figure 6a. Here, the MS signals are slightly delayed from the
DSC signals because of technical reasons related to our experimental
system. Exothermic reactions were observed from approximately 150
°C up to 300 °C for all samples when the temperature was
increasing. It is expected that these exothermic peaks are originated
in the NH3 generation from Li3N and/or hydrogenation
of the alloys. The MS signal corresponding to NH3 (mass
17) was observed for the C, Si, and Sn systems, suggesting that the
expected NH3 synthesis reaction occurred. Here, mass 16,
which is a main fragment of NH3, was also detected, and
the profile was synchronized with that of mass 17 (see Figure S12). On the other hand, NH3 generation was not found in the case of the Ge system. NH3 generation by eq 9 requires
Li3N; however, an unknown phase is formed as the product
after the nitrogenation of Li22Ge5 alloy. This
would be the reason why NH3 was not generated. Figure 6b shows XRD patterns
of the products after the reaction with H2. Only when Li3N is converted into NH3 and LiH by the reaction
with H2, the alloy phases should not be changed and remain
after the above reaction. The main diffraction peak observed for the
C system was at the same position after the reaction, and a shoulder
appeared at a higher angle, suggesting that the small amount of Li
is removed from the graphene layers. In the cases of Si and Ge systems,
the intensity of diffraction peaks assigned to Li7Si3 and Li7Ge2, which are the alloy phases
with lower Li composition, was increased compared with the XRD patterns
of the products after the nitrogenation shown in Figure 1b. The Sn system revealed a
clear difference before and after the reaction with H2,
and then Li7Sn2 and Li13Sn5 generated by the nitrogenation completely changed to LiSn. These
results indicated that the following hydrogenation of the Li–M
alloys partially occurred to form LiH in addition to the NH3 generation outlined by eq 9 10   11   12   13  where it would be difficult to observe diffraction
peaks corresponding to LiH because of the low electron number. From
the above results, it was clarified that NH3 can be synthesized
from the nitrogenated Li–C, Li–Si, and Li–Sn
alloys, indicating that Li3N was formed as the product
for these alloys. The results obtained by the NH3 synthesis
are consistent with the above nitrogenation properties of the Li–M
alloys.

Figure 6 (a) DSC profiles of the nitrogenated Li–M alloys under the
H2 flow condition and (b) XRD patterns of the products.

The final products after the NH3 synthesis can be recycled
back to the Li–M alloys with the release of H2 below
500 °C.24 Thus, the N2 dissociation
and recombination reactions of Li–M alloys can be utilized
as the pseudocatalyst for the NH3 synthesis. The reaction
mechanism for the dissociation of nitrogen triple bonds is totally
different compared to that using the typical catalysts.8−10,28 The conditions required for the
NH3 synthesis using the reactions of Li alloys are less
than 500 °C and 0.5 MPa, which are milder than those of the conventional
Haber–Bosch process operated at 400–600 °C under
20–40 MPa. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the reaction
temperature is further decreased by the optimization of the reaction
conditions. Consequently, the pseudocatalytic process using the Li
alloys is expected to be a potential technique as small-scale and
distributed-type NH3 syntheses, although the Haber–Bosch
process is well-established as a mass production technique. As discussed
above, Li3N generated from the alloys by the reaction with
N2 is nanosized, indicating that the nano-Li3N has high reactivity for other reactions. Furthermore, it is possible
that the nanosize and reactivity of Li3N are preserved
during the utilization cycles because Li is returned to its atomic
states to form the alloy phases, suggesting that the reactions using
Li–M alloys are expected to be a “self-activation”
process. The feasibility of the Li–M alloys as the pseudocatalyst
for the syntheses of various nitrides and their cycle properties will
be investigated in detail in future.

Conclusions
Lithium
alloys are synthesized by a reaction between Li and M,
where M is C, Si, Ge, and Sn. The nitrogenation properties were investigated
using the DSC measurements under N2 gas. All alloys dissociate
the nitrogen triple bond of N2 to form atomic states as
nitrides below 500 °C. For Li alloys involving C, Si, and Sn,
the nanosized Li3N was formed as the product, whereas unknown
nitrides were generated in the case of the Li–Ge alloy. It
is interesting that the generated Li3N is partially of
the nanotube or nanofiber structure. The denitrogenation reactions
by Li3N and M were examined using the thermal analysis
up to 600 °C under the Ar flow conditions, and the N2 desorption was observed for all systems. For the Ge alloy, the ternary
nitride formation as an unexpected reaction was observed. It is indicated
that the Li–C and Li–Si alloys show partially reversible
reactions with N2. Among the series of Li–M alloys,
the Li–Sn alloy is the only potential material that can control
the dissociation and recombination of N2 below 500 °C
by the reversible reaction with the largest amount of usable Li. From
the above results, it is concluded that the nitrogenation and denitrogenation
reactions of the Li alloys at lower temperatures would be realized
by the high reactivity with N2 and the high mobility of
Li. Furthermore, the feasibility of the Li alloys as the pseudocatalytic
process for NH3 synthesis was experimentally demonstrated.
As a result, NH3 can be synthesized below 500 °C under
less than 0.5 MPa of pressure. Considering the reaction mechanism,
it is expected that the pseudocatalytic processes using Li alloys
are developed as the self-activation process.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
Lithium (99≥%, Sigma Aldrich),
carbon (99.999%, Strem Chemicals), silicon (99.999%, Kojundo Chemical
Lab.), germanium (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich), tin (99.99%, Kojundo Chemical
Lab.), and lithium nitride (99.5≥%, Sigma Aldrich) were purchased
for use as starting materials. To synthesize Li22Si5, Li22Ge5, and Li22Sn5, Li metal was respectively mixed with Si, Ge, or Sn with
a molar ratio of 22:5 (4.4:1). Then, a mechanical alloying using a
ball-mill apparatus (P7, Fritsch) was performed for the mixtures for
2 or 3 h at 370 rpm. A total of 300 mg of the mixture was put into
a 30 cm3 milling vessel (SKD-11) with 20 steel balls (SUJ-2),
and the milling vessel was filled with 0.1 MPa of Ar. After the milling,
to induce crystallization, each sample of the Li–Si and Li–Ge
was annealed for 1 h at 500 °C under 0.1 MPa of Ar and dynamic
vacuum, respectively. The above synthesis procedures have been reported
previously.22−24 Lithium-intercalated graphite (LiC12)
was prepared using hand-milling for Li granules and graphite powders
with a 1:12 molar ratio for 40 min on an agate mortar. After that,
the obtained mixture was annealed at 500 °C under 0.1 MPa of
Ar. The mixtures of Li3N and M were prepared to investigate
the nitrogen desorption properties. The molar ratio of Li3N and M was chosen to be 22:15 (Li:M = 4.4:1) for the Si, Ge, or
Sn system and to be 1:18 for the C system. Ball-milling was carried
out for 2 h under 0.1 MPa of Ar at a rotation speed of 370 rpm. Here,
20 steel balls were used for the Si, Ge, or Sn system, and 20 zirconia
balls were used for the C system.

Experimental Procedure
The thermal reaction properties
with N2 of the alloys were investigated by DSC, which were
placed into a glove box (Miwa MFG, MP-P60 W) filled with purified
Ar (>99.9999%), and then the generated gases were in situ analyzed
using MS (Canon Anelva Corporation, M-100QA). Nitrogenation of the
Li alloys in a batch reactor filled with 0.1 MPa N2 was
performed up to 500 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The nitrogen desorption properties were investigated
using TG, differential thermal analysis (Rigaku, TG8120), and thermal
desorption mass spectroscopy (Anelva, M-QA200TS), which were set in
a glove box in an Ar atmosphere. Morphology of the products obtained
by the reactions between the Li alloys and N2 was observed
using TEM (JEOL, JEM-2010) and SEM (JEOL, JIB-4600F/HKD). For the
TEM measurements, EDS and electron diffraction measurements for some
parts were carried out to characterize the materials. BS images were
observed together with SEM images to obtain a high contrast for elements
with greater atomic masses. Solid products were identified using XRD
measurements (Rigaku, RINT-2100, Cu Kα radiation). In this procedure,
the sample was put on a glass plate and covered by a polyimide sheet
(Du Pont-Toray Co., Ltd., Kapton) to prevent the oxidation of the
samples. To know the feasibility of using N2 dissociation
and recombination reaction by the Li alloys, the NH3 generation
experiments using the nitrogenated Li alloys were carried out at temperatures
ranging from room temperature to 300 °C at a heating rate of
5 °C min–1 under 0.5 MPa of H2 with
a flow rate of 50 cm3 min–1.
