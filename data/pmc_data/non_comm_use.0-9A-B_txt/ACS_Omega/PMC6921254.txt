Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) is a well-known hypoxia
mimetic
mediator that induces hypoxia-like responses. CoCl2, a
mediator confirmed to alleviate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),
has been associated with a variety of hypoxic responses. HIF-1 is
the foremost transcriptionfactor that is particularly activated during
hypoxia and regulates various genes. Therefore, this study aimed to
investigate the cellular and molecular responses of the co-cultured
cells under the influence of the CoCl2-induced hypoxic
condition. Mono- and co-cultured C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells were exposed
to CoCl2, and a significant induction in HIF-1, reactive
oxygen species and lipid peroxidase and a reduction in glutathione
and catalase were observed. The expressions of proapoptotic genes
like Bax, p53, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were notably increased, whereas
the antiapoptotic gene, i.e., Bcl2, was downregulated during hypoxia
in mono- as well as co-cultured C2C12 cells. However, the co-cultured
C2C12 cells show significantly lower induction in oxidative stress
and expression of apoptotic genes in comparison to monocultured C2C12
cells. Whereas, the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show comparatively higher
oxidative stress and apoptotic event in comparison to monocultured
3T3-L1 cells. The reason may be the communication between the cells
and some soluble factors that help in cell survival/death from hypoxia.
Moreover, it may also be due to the fact that fat and muscle cells
interact and communicate via proximity and mutual ability when growing
together. Therefore, the co-culture system provides a unique approach
to intercellular communication between the two different cell types.

==== Body
Introduction
Mammalian cells have developed a unique
feature of adaptation of
survival under the hypoxic condition, and hypoxia controls the capability
of a cell to sustain its energy level. To restore the oxygenation
of the tissue, cells activate the expression of glycolytic genes1 and start proliferation and angiogenesis. Due
to severe hypoxia, the DNA mismatch repair activity of the cells is
reduced, resulting in a high mutation rate.2 Hypoxia also causes genetic variability via stimulation of fragile
sites triggering gene amplification.3,4 Therefore,
cells start a cascade of the apoptotic event during severe hypoxia
or anoxia conditions to prevent hypoxia-induced mutation in the cells.5 Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) is an eminent
hypoxia imitative agent and finest chemical inducers of hypoxia-like
responses.6 Hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1) is an imperative aspect of the hypoxia response, and it can
induce apoptosis, stimulate cell proliferation, and prevent cell death.7−9

Several studies have shown that the introduction of CoCl2 induces excessive construction of reactive oxygen species
(ROS)
and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane by activating hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α) and several other mechanisms. In addition,
it has also been shown that metal-induced ROS-mediated oxidative stress
leads to commencement of nuclear transcription factors, a variety
of signaling proteins, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis10 HIF-1α is unruffled of HIF-1α and
ARNT subunits,11 and it binds to the DNA
motif of hypoxia response elements and is overexpressed during neovascularization.
Nuclear factor kappa B has also been activated by hypoxia, which controls
the transcription of many genes required for neovascularization, cells
adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.12,13

At the molecular level, hypoxia upregulates the hypoxia-inducible
factor-1 (HIF-1) in muscle cells. The expressions of myoglobin, vascular
endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes were increased in
a hypoxia-dependent approach after induction in the expression of
HIF-1.14,15 It has also been reported that the area
of muscle structure and muscle fiber is changed during the severe
hypoxia condition.16 Moreover, cellular
marks of mitochondrial humiliation stuff overcome under circumstances
of augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation.17 Although an increase or decrease in ROS generation under
the hypoxic condition is still controversial,18 it seems that ROS could restrain the movement of HIF-1 and other
redox-sensitive transcription factors.19 Furthermore, ROS formation has also been revealed to exert hypoxia-induced
cell death in various tissues through oxidative damage to macromolecules
like nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane phospholipids.20

A growing body of evidence advocates that
the CoCl2-induced
ROS production causes neuronal damage.21−23 It is clearly shown
that the high level of ROS attacks nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane
phospholipids, which eventually lead to neuronal apoptosis.24,25 Zou et al.21 have reported that CoCl2 stimulates cell death in PC12 cells via activating caspase-3
and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). p38/MAPK is one of
the apoptotic markers during PC12 cell death induced by a range of
stimuli.22,26 p38/MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2, which are the
members of MAPK family, have been activated by ROS formation in various
cell types. Hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is associated
with oxidative stress, which is responsible for neurogenerative disorders,
like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.25,27 In the oxidative stress condition,
ROS, superoxide (O2–), hydroxyl radical
(HO–), and H2O2 are produced
in high amounts.25,28 Oxidative stress induces too
much amount of ROS that modifies the lipids, proteins, and DNA and
alters their functions, causing apoptosis of neuronal cells.29,30

The co-culture system is the most powerful approach to study
cell–cell
communications and cell–cell interactions. Synthetic biologists
use this system for studying and engineering complex multicellular
synthetic systems. In the co-culture system, different cell types
were cultured directly or indirectly within a similar culture environment.
In straight co-cultures, cells are assorted collectively and allowed
to make a direct contact within the same culture environment. In indirect
co-cultures, cell interaction occurs via soluble factors within the
culture environment and both the cell types are detached by the inserts.

To study the natural interactions between cell populations and
to improve the culture success for certain populations, the co-culture
system has been used. Moreover, the co-culture system provides an
important platform for drug discovery because it offers a more illustrative
in vivo-like model and helps in monitoring the effects of drugs on
cell–cell interactions.31 The co-culture
system is also being used to overpass the fissure amid in vitro and
in vivo model systems. The co-culture system has been used to learn
immune defense and the effects of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils,
and lymphocytes on epithelial cell function.32 A few studies show that the co-culture system alters the messenger
RNA (mRNA) expression of adipogenic marker genes in adipocytes. For
instance, the adipogenic marker genes of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells
have been upregulated by C2C12 cells when both the cells were co-cultured.33 The expression of C/EBPb and GPR43 genes increased
in adipocytes when the bovine muscle satellite cells were co-cultured
with preadipocytes.34 In addition, the
differentiation of porcine preadipocytes was repressed in the co-culture
system and the expression of marker genes in the previous phase of
adipogenic differentiation was lesser than that in the monocultured
cells.35

In fetal, postnatal, and
adult animals, the muscle development
process starts earlier than the fat cells. The budding fat cells,
near to muscles, go through all development and differentiation phases
in secure immediacy alike mature, multinucleated, and functional skeletal
muscles.36 The intend of the current study
was to explore the impact of CoCl2 exposure on the modulation
of a variety of genes associated with hypoxia such as HIF-1α
and apoptosis such as Box, Bcl2, p53, and caspase-9/3 in the co-culture
system.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and Consumables
The specified chemicals, reagents,
and the culture medium were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO) and Gibco BRL. All of the culture wares were procured from Nunc,
Denmark, for the study. Throughout the study, Milli-Q water was used.

Cell Culture
The C2C12 (mouse myoblast) and 3T3-L1
(mouse preadipocyte) cell lines were ordered from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas), and both cell lines were cultured and maintained
as the method given by the provider at the Department of Animal Science
and Biotechnology, Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of
Korea. In brief, the specific culture medium [Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% sodium
bicarbonate, and 1% antibiotic] was used to culture the C2C12 and
3T3-L1 cell lines and kept in a CO2 incubator having 37
°C temperature, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. Once the
confluency reached up to 75–85%, we pass the culture in 1:6
ratio and change the medium two times in a week. Mycoplasma contamination
was not found throughout the study. The trypan blue dye exclusion
assay was used to check the cell viability before starting all of
the experiments, and the culture having 95% or more cell viability
was used.

Experimental Design
A diagramatic representation of
the experimental design is shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Experimental
design.

Cytotoxicity Assessment [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
Bromide (MTT) Assay]
The MTT assay was used to measure the
cytotoxicity by using the method described by Kumar.37 In brief, 96-well plates were used to culture the C2C12
and 3T3-L1 cells and 1 × 104 cells were seeded in
each well. The culture plates were kept for 24 h in a CO2 incubator, and after 24 h, the medium was removed and the cells
were exposed with CoCl2 (37.5, 75, 150, and 300 μM)
for 12–48 h in the CO2 incubator. MTT salt (10 μL,
5 mg/mL stock solution) was added in each well 4 h before reaching
their respective time periods. After completion of their respective
time periods, the medium containing CoCl2 and MTT salt
was removed and 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide per well was used
to dissolve the formazan crystals. The plates were kept for 10 min
at room temperature, and a multiwell microplate reader was used to
obtain absorbance at 550 nm (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek). Correspondingly,
the control sets were also run without exposure to CoCl2 in the same environment.

Differentiation of Preadipocyte (3T3-L1) to Adipocyte Cells
The DMEM (contains 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) was
used to culture the 3T3-L1 cells, and the culture plates were kept
in the CO2 incubator and maintained as described earlier.
The differentiation medium [differentiation medium composition: 90%
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mM methylisobutylxanthine, 1.0 μM dexamethasone,
2.0 μM rosiglitazone, and 1.0 μg/mL insulin] was used
to differentiate the preadipocytes into adipocytes. The adipocytes
were maintained in adipocyte maintenance medium (90% Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1.0 μg/mL
insulin). In brief, the 70–80% confluent 3T3-L1 cells were
harvested by trypsinization and seeded in a six-well culture plate
supplemented with complete DMEM for 48 h or more to achieve 100% confluence.
The cells were incubated in differentiation medium for 48 h, and after
that, the medium was changed with adipocyte maintenance medium. The
adipocyte maintenance medium was changed every 48–72 h. The
preadipocytes will take 7–15 days after the induction to differentiate
into fully mature adipocytes, which can be seen by lipid droplet formation.

Oil Red O Cell Staining
The oil red O (0.35 g) dye
was procured from Sigma-Aldrich. The dye was dissolved in isopropanol
(100 mL) and kept for 12–14 h at room temperature. The Whatman
filter paper was used to remove the precipitate formed in the solution.
The working solution (0.1%) was prepared by mixing 30 mL of water
into 60 mL of filtered dye solution and kept for 12–14 h at
4 °C. The solution was filtered two times before staining the
cells. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 1 h, the cells
were washed again two to three times with PBS, and 0.1% oil red O
working solution was added into the plates for 1–2 h. After
completion of the incubation period, the cells were washed three times
with PBS and the images of the cells were captured by a phase contrast
microscope.

Differentiation of C2C12 Cells to Myotubes
C2C12 mouse
myoblasts were cultured in DMEM and maintained in a CO2 incubator, and the cell viability was determined with the help of
the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Prior to the start of differentiation,
the DMEM having 10% fetal bovine serum was replaced with 1% fetal
calf serum38 to induce the differentiation
of myoblasts into myotubes.

Co-culture of C2C12 and 3T3-L1
Transwell inserts having
a 0.4 μm porous membrane were used to co-culture C2C12 and 3T3-L1
according to the protocol of Sun.39 C2C12
and 3T3-L1 cells were cultured separately on the transwell plates.
Once the cells differentiated, the inserts having 3T3-L1 were transferred
to the C2C12 cell plate and vice versa. The cells were allowed to
grow together for 12, 24, and 48 h; after that, the cells present
in the lower wells of the insert were harvested for further study.

Cell Viability by the Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion Assay
Cell viability was determined by using the trypan blue dye exclusion
assay in which the loss of membrane integrity was assessed.40 In brief, 1 × 105 cells per
well were seeded in six-well culture plates and kept for 24 h in a
CO2 incubator to grow properly. Then, the normal DMEM was
changed with the medium containing CoCl2 (37.5, 75, and
150 μM) for 12, 24, and 48 h. Following the exposure, the cells
were subjected to measure the cell viability. After the completion
of the respective time periods, the cells were harvested, centrifuged
at 800 rpm for 5 min, washed two times with sterile PBS, and resuspended
in a small amount of PBS. The trypan blue dye (0.4% solution) was
mixed with cell suspension in a 1:5 ratio (dye/cell suspension). The
cell suspension solution (10 μL) with trypan blue was put on
a hemocytometer, and unstained live and blue-stained dead cells were
counted under a phase contrast microscope. The control sets without
exposure to CoCl2 were also run in the same environment.

MTT Assay of Co-cultured Cells
The MTT assay of co-cultured
cells has been carried out by using the same method as described in
the previous section.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation
2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA; Sigma-Aldrich) fluorescent dye41 has been used to measure the ROS generation induced by
hypoxia in both mono- and co-cultured cells. In brief, six-well plates
were used to culture the C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) and allowed to remain for 24 h in a CO2 incubator.
Both the mono- and co-cultured cells were exposed with CoCl2 (150 μM) for 12, 24, and 48 h. The DCFH-DA (20 μM) dye
was added into the cells for 30 min at 37 °C after the completion
of the respective time periods. The cells containing culture medium
and DCFH-DA dye were changed with 200 μL of PBS per well, and
the plates were shaken for 10 min at room temperature in the dark
condition The fluorescence strength was calculated by using a multiwell
microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek) at 485 and 528 nm of excitation
and emission wavelengths, respectively. The unexposed cells were also
run, and the data were presented as a percentage of control.

Glutathione (GSH) Content Measurement
The glutathione
content was assessed by using the method of Vivek et al.42 The mono- and co-cultured cells receiving exposure
of CoCl2 (150 μM for 12, 24, and 48 h) were washed
two times with cold PBS. The deoxycholic acid with sucrose solution
was added to prepare the cell lysate and centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Perchloric acid (1%) was taken
to precipitate the protein present in the supernatant solution and
further centrifuged at 10 000g for 5 min at
4 °C. The precipitated protein (20 μL) was taken in a 96-well
black bottom plate and mixed with 160 μL of 0.1 M phosphate,
5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (pH 8.3), and 20
μL of o-phthalaldehyde (1 mg dissolved in 1
mL of methanol). The plates were kept for 3 h in a dark place at room
temperature for incubation, and then, fluorescence was recorded at
355 and 460 nm of excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively,
with the help of a multiwell microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek).
Perchloric acid (1%) was used as a standard of GSH, and the results
were presented in nanomoles of GSH/mg cellular protein.

Lipid Peroxidation (LPO)
The thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive
substance protocol43 was used to measure
lipid peroxidation. In brief, both the C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells were
cultured and 1 × 105 cells/well were sown in six-well
plates for 24 h in the CO2 incubator. The 150 μM
concentration of CoCl2 was used to treat both the cells
for 12, 24, and 48 h. The cells present in lower wells were harvested
once they reached to their respective time periods. The cells were
sonicated in chilled 1.15% potassium chloride solution at 3000g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The thiobarbituric
acid reagent (2 mL; composition: 0.7% TBA, 15% trichloroacetic acid,
and 0.25 N HCl) was mixed with 1 mL of supernatant, and the mixture
was kept in a water bath for 15 min at 100 °C. Finally, the mixture
was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000g and the 535 nm
wavelength was used to calculate the absorbance of the supernatant.
All of the values are represented as a percentage of control.

Assessment of Catalase Levels
The assessment of catalase
activity was done with the help of a commercially accessible kit (Catalog
no. 707002; Cayman Chemicals) and the instructions given by the manufacturer.
In concise, C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells (1 × 105 cells/well)
were seeded in six-well plates in a CO2 incubator for 24
h to normalize. Both the mono- and co-cultured cells were treated
with CoCl2 (150 μM) for 12, 24, and 48 h. Once the
time periods over, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the cell pellet. The
cells were sonicated in chilled buffer (1.0 mL) having the composition
50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA. The supernatant
was collected for analysis by centrifugation at 10 000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Furthermore, the reaction was
started by adding 20 μL of 0.88 M hydrogen peroxide in the reaction
mixture containing 20 μL of sample, 100 μL of assay buffer
(provided in the kit), and 30 μL of methanol in a 96-well plate.
The plate was kept for incubation on a shaker at room temperature,
and after 20 min, potassium hydroxide (30 μL) was added to stop
the reaction. Afterward, 30 μL of chromogen was supplemented
and incubated for 10 min accompanied by adding 10 μL of potassium
periodate. The plates were set aside for 5 min at room temperature,
and the absorbance was recorded at 540 nm with the help of a multiwell
microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek).

Transcriptional Changes
Hypoxia-induced alterations
in the RNA level of genes involved in apoptosis such as Bax, Bcl2,
p53, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were studied in both mono- and co-cultured
cells by using the protocol of Kumar.44 Hypoxia-induced alterations in the mRNA level were articulated in
fold change with respect to control cells. In short, total RNA from
treated and control cells was isolated with the help of the TRI reagent
(Catalog no. T9424, Sigma-Aldrich). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared
by 1 μg of RNA with the help of a High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Catalog no. 4368814, Applied Biosystems), and 2×
SYBR Green polymerase chain reaction (PCR) master mix (Applied Biosystems)
was used for real-time PCR in a Bio-Rad Sequence Detection System.
For every sample, three reactions were done in three different wells
and β-actin was used as an internal control.

Statistical Analysis
The values in results are articulated
as mean ± standard error (SE) of three autonomous experiments.
To identify the differences among treated and control groups, one-way
analysis of variance pursued by post hoc Dunnett’s test was
used. *p < 0.05 was used to designate the significant
changes.

Results
Cytotoxicity Assessment (MTT Assay)
The results of
the MTT assay are shown in Figure 2. C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells responded to CoCl2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. There was no significant reduction
in percent cell viability till 24 h after exposure to 37.5 μM
concentration of CoCl2, whereas the concentrations of CoCl2 used, i.e., 150 and 300 μM, were found to cause a more
steady reduction in percent cell viability, which reached significant
levels at and above the exposure period of 24 h. The cell viability
reduces to 87.49 ± 4.69, 78.36 ± 5.63, and 69.52 ±
3.35 at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, after exposure to 150 μM
CoCl2 in C2C12 cells. The reduction was more in C2C12 cells
when they were exposed to the highest concentration, i.e., 300 μM,
where the viability reduces to 79.23 ± 3.22, 67.94 ± 3.71,
and 55.17 ± 2.53 at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, compared
to unexposed control cells (Figure 2A). Trends were similar in the case of 3T3-L1 cells,
which show 82.47 ± 6.11, 75.33 ± 4.53, and 67.88 ±
2.86 reduction in cell viability when exposed to 150 μM and
it reached its peak, i.e., 77.51 ± 4.43, 63.48 ± 2.73, and
52.77 ± 3.61 after exposure to 300 μM CoCl2 for
periods of 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, compared to unexposed control
cells (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 Identification

and 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were exposed to CoCl2 (37.5–300
μM) for 12–48 h in C2C12 (A)
and 3T3-L1 cells (B). The percent cell viability was assessed using
the MTT assay. Values are given as mean ± standard error of the
data obtained from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Differentiation of Preadipocyte (3T3-L1) to Adipocyte Cells
The 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in complete DMEM for 24 h at 37
°C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity atmosphere conditions.
Then, the medium was completely changed to differentiated medium and
the cells were left for differentiation for 48 h. After 48 h, the
adipocytes were kept in adipocyte maintenance medium in place of differentiation
medium and changed every 48–72 h. The preadipocyte cells were
completely differentiated into adipocytes between 7 and 15 days following
induction, as shown by lipid droplet structures in Oil Red O staining
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Differentiation
of preadipocyte cells (3T3-L1) to adipocyte cells.
After co-culturing, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiation,
the inverted microscope images on days 4, 7, and (Oil Red O-stained)
were shown, and the cell triglyceride accumulation was detected.

Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion Assay
The straight loss in
the viable cell count was also assessed instantly after exposure to
CoCl2 at each time point (12, 24, and 48 h) using the trypan
blue dye exclusion test. The result highlights are shown in Figure 4. At 48 h, a statistically
significant drop in the percent cell viability was found and it sustained
in all time periods (24 and 48 h) after exposure to 37.5, 75, and
150 μM concentrations of CoCl2. At 24 h, the co-cultured
C2C12 cells show 96.58 ± 2.95, 88.99 ± 4.22, and 86.27 ±
5.46% cell viability and 93.39 ± 2.73, 87.62 ± 3.56, and
82.55 ± 4.83% cell viability at 48 h after the exposure to 37.5,
75, and 150 μM concentrations of CoCl2 (Figure 4A). However, the
monocultured C2C12 cells show the reduction in cell viability, i.e.,
93.04 ± 2.58, 84.61 ± 4.47, and 80.64 ± 5.27% at 24
h and 88.99 ± 4.57, 81.18 ± 2.67, and 74.72 ± 3.93%
at 48 h after exposure to 37.5, 75, and 150 μM concentrations
of CoCl2 (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Cytotoxicity assessment of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in
mono- and co-cultured C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells (trypan blue dye exclusion
assay). Monoculture C2C12 cells (A), co-cultured C2C12 cells (B),
monocultured 3T3-L1 cells (C), and co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells (D) were
exposed to CoCl2 (37.5–150 μM) for 12–48
h. The data presented are percent cell viability compared to unexposed
control cells. Values are given as mean ± standard error of the
data obtained from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Similarly, the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show 91.73
± 5.50,
83.03 ± 3.75, and 77.45 ± 3.28% at 24 h and 85.21 ±
3.54, 78.84 ± 1.97, and 69.14 ± 3.02% cell viability at
48 h after exposure to 37.5, 75, and 150 μM concentrations of
CoCl2, respectively (Figure 4C). However, the monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show a significant
reduction in cell viability, i.e., 94.30 ± 3.84, 84.11 ±
2.20, and 82.47 ± 4.76% at 24 h and 88.23 ± 3.78, 83.80
± 3.34, and 75.26 ± 4.42% at 48 h after exposure to 37.5,
75, and 150 μM concentrations of CoCl2, respectively
(Figure 4D).

MTT Assay of Co-cultured Cells
The results of the MTT
assay of co-cultured cells are shown in Figure 5. There was a reduction in percent cell viability
throughout the exposure periods, i.e., till 48 h in the co-cultured
cells after exposure to 150 μM CoCl2. However, the
150 μM concentration of CoCl2 was responsible for
more diminution in percent cell viability of monocultured C2C12 cells,
which reaches to a significant stage at and over the exposure period
of 24 h. The cell viability reduces to 96.59 ± 5.33, 92.34 ±
4.02, and 88.21 ± 4.69% at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, after
exposure to 150 μM CoCl2 in co-cultured C2C12 cells.
The reduction was more pronounced in monocultured C2C12 cells exposed
to 150 μM concentration of CoCl2, where the cell
viability reduces to 91.38 ± 4.16, 83.62 ± 3.38, and 75.44
± 4.92%. However, the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show 87.44 ±
8.91, 79.26 ± 6.13, and 69.73 ± 4.69% and the monocultured
3T3-L1 cells show 90.15 ± 4.42, 84.51 ± 5.61, and 77.69
± 3.98% cell viability after exposure to 150 μM CoCl2 for periods of 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, compared to
unexposed control cells. The reduction in cell viability was more
in co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells in comparison to monocultured 3T3-L1 cells
(Figure 5).

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation
The results
of CoCl2-induced ROS formation are shown in Figure 6A. Monocultured C2C12 cells
show significant (p < 0.01) receptiveness against
CoCl2 (150 μM) at all time points and show 121.64
± 3.76, 136.42 ± 4.77, and 154.73 ± 2.47% ROS generation
at 12, 24, and 24 h, respectively. However, the induction of ROS generation
was comparatively reduced in co-cultured in comparison to monocultured
C2C12 cells. The co-cultured C2C12 cells show the significant decrease
in ROS generation, i.e.,113.86 ± 3.10, 124.26 ± 5.27, and
132.55 ± 4.28% after exposure to CoCl2 (150 μM)
for 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, in comparison to unexposed control
cells. At the same time, ROS generation was also studied in monocultured
3T3-L1 cells that show 117.92 ± 4.69, 129.66 ± 2.78, and
147.28 ± 3.58%; however, co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show significantly
higher ROS generation, i.e.,125.38 ± 2.22, 141.18 ± 4.40,
and 159.52 ± 5.50% in comparison to monocultured cells at 12,
24, and 48 h of CoCl2 (150 μM) exposures.

represented are the mean ± standard error of three identical
experiments made in three replicates. *p < 0.05
and **p < 0.01 in comparison to respective unexposed
controls.

Glutathione Content Measurement
Cells exposed to CoCl2 (150 μM) were found to show a decrease in the level
of GSH notably at all of the time points in monocultured C2C12 cells,
in comparison to control. While the co-cultured C2C12 cells could
not cause such rigorous effects, the trends were similar. The co-cultured
C2C12 cells show the least toxicity in comparison to monocultured
C2C12 cells. However, the monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show a higher
decrease in the level of GSH in comparison to co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells
(Figure 6B).

Lipid Peroxidation (LPO)
CoCl2 (150 μM)
induced significant lipid peroxidation in monocultured C2C12 cells
at exposure times of 12 h (117.92 ± 3.01%), 24 h (128.37 ±
5.58%), and 48 h (145.24 ± 3.59%) in comparison to that in control.
The trends were similar in the case of co-cultured C2C12 cells, but
the induction of lipid peroxidation was less in comparison to monocultured
C2C12 cells. The co-cultured C2C12 cells show 111.77 ± 2.55,
119.68 ± 4.23, and 126.44 ± 4.69% LPO at 12, 24, and 48
h, respectively, after exposure to 150 μM CoCl2 in
comparison to unexposed control cells (Figure 6C). The monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show 116.68
± 2.04, 127.59 ± 3.15, and 137.46 ± 4.13%, while the
co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show 120.55 ± 8.10, 133.82 ± 4.90,
and 149.35 ± 5.24% LPO at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, in
comparison to unexposed control cells (Figure 6C).

Assessment of Catalase Level
A significant decline
in the catalase activity was ascertained at 150 μM CoCl2, and the monocultured C2C12 cells show 88.39 ± 5.38,
81.67 ± 4.42, and 69.54 ± 3.67% catalase activity at 12,
24, and 48 h, respectively. The trends were also similar in the case
of co-cultured C2C12 cells which show 92.15 ± 3.52, 89.33 ±
2.52, and 83.48 ± 4.51% catalase activity at 12, 24, and 48 h,
respectively (Figure 6D). However, the monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show 87.28 ± 3.24,
82.12 ± 4.80, and 72.63 ± 2.72% catalase activity, while
the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show 85.52 ± 3.59, 77.29 ±
3.01, and 63.94 ± 2.16 at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, in
comparison to unexposed control cells (Figure 6D).

Transcriptional Changes in Genes Associated with Hypoxia and
Apoptosis
Alteration in the RNA level of the genes involved
in hypoxia and apoptosis was studied in both monocultured and co-cultured
cells following the introduction of CoCl2 (150 μM).
The significant upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α)
and proapoptotic genes such as Bax, p53, caspase-3, and caspase-9
and the downregulation of an antiapoptotic gene such as Bcl2 have
been recorded following treatment with 150 μM CoCl2 in both mono- and co-cultured cells. The expression of HIF-1α
increases significantly from 6.89 ± 0.32- to 14.24 ± 0.45-fold
in monocultured C2C12 cells and 5.89 ± 0.19- to 12.46 ±
0.43-fold in co-cultured C2C12 cells at 12–48 h, respectively,
after exposure to CoCl2. The monocultured C2C12 cells showed
more apoptotic response in comparison to co-cultured C2C12 cells after
exposure to CoCl2 (150 μM). The monocultured C2C12
cells show the upregulation of Bax (2.15 ± 0.18, 3.68 ±
0.16, and 4.76 ± 0.12 fold), p53 (3.12 ± 0.12, 5.85 ±
0.27, and 7.74 ± 0.34 fold), caspase-3 (2.94 ± 0.19, 4.87
± 0.22, and 5.96 ± 0.24 fold), and caspase-9 (3.27 ±
0.09, 5.68 ± 0.14, and 7.29 ± 0.43 fold) and the downregulation
of Bcl2 (0.86 ± 0.02, 0.71 ± 0.06, and 0.56 ± 0.03
fold) at the contact periods of 12, 24, and 48 h correspondingly after
exposure to CoCl2 (Figure 7). The trends were similar in the expression of pro-
and antiapoptotic genes in co-cultured C2C12 cells; however, the 3T3-L1
cells protect the C2C12 cells from apoptosis after exposure to CoCl2 and show the expression of Bax (1.54 ± 0.13, 2.46 ±
0.21, and 2.95 ± 0.26 fold), p53 (2.72 ± 0.08, 3.96 ±
0.16, and 5.89 ± 0.20 fold), caspase-3 (1.98 ± 0.06, 3.38
± 0.10, and 4.21 ± 0.14 fold), and caspase-9 (2.15 ±
0.07, 3.77 ± 0.10, and 5.39 ± 0.17 fold) and downregulation
of Bcl2 (0.92 ± 0.06, 0.85 ± 0.05, and 0.73 ± 0.03
fold) at the same time points (Figure 7).

transcripts were expressed in fold changes (mean ± standard error)
compared to unexposed controls. *p < 0.05 and
**p < 0.01 in comparison to respective unexposed

The monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show the expression
of HIF-1α
7.91 ± 0.14, 10.15 ± 0.21, and 15.23 ± 0.44 fold and
co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show 8.64 ± 0.20, 10.49 ± 0.30,
and 16.45 ± 0.34 fold at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, after
exposure to CoCl2. The monocultured 3T3-L1 cells show the
upregulation of Bax (2.36 ± 0.10, 3.79 ± 0.07, and 4.25
± 0.18 fold), p53 (2.87 ± 0.30, 4.49 ± 0.18, and 5.67
± 0.24 fold), caspase-3 (3.83 ± 0.27, 4.86 ± 0.20,
and 5.69 ± 0.24 fold), and caspase-9 (3.97 ± 0.13, 6.08
± 0.23, and 7.13 ± 0.28 fold) and the downregulation of
Bcl2 (0.81 ± 0.03, 0.74 ± 0.04, and 0.68 ± 0.02 fold)
at the contact periods of 12, 24, and 48 h in that order after exposure
to CoCl2 (Figure 8). The tendencies were similar in the expression of pro- and
antiapoptotic genes in co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells; however, the expression
of apoptotic genes increased after exposure to CoCl2 and
it shows the expression of Bax (2.93 ± 0.10, 4.37 ± 0.22,
and 5.78 ± 0.17 fold), p53 (3.61 ± 0.17, 5.25 ± 0.12,
and 6.94 ± 0.21 fold), caspase-3 (4.47 ± 0.15, 5.98 ±
0.11, and 6.85 ± 0.30 fold), and caspase-9 (4.85 ± 0.21,
7.39 ± 0.31, and 8.67 ± 0.36 fold) and the downregulation
of Bcl2 (0.76 ± 0.07, 0.67 ± 0.08, and 0.59 ± 0.03
fold) at the same time points (Figure 8). The mono- and co-cultured cells were compared to
control cells, and we found that they are statistically significant.
After that, we compared the mono- and co-cultured cells with each
other and found that they are statically significant for all of the
apoptotic genes.

Discussion
The arrangement of cellular processes has
been affected by the
decrease in the level of oxygen, which is the most causative aspect
in several pathologies.45,46 In hypoxia, ROS modulate
the expression of genes concerned in signal transduction.47 Oxidative stress results due to constant hypoxia
and excessive ROS production, which may be concomitant in the induction
of apoptosis.48 Cobalt chloride mimics
the hypoxia-like response by upregulating the genes and promoting
cell death in many cellular systems. We exposed the cells with CoCl2 to study the molecular and cellular responses of both mono-
and co-cultured cells toward hypoxia and the potential involvement
of free radicals in reaction to hypoxia.

In this study, we found
that the exposure to nontoxic concentration
of CoCl2 triggers the activation of HIF-1α, oxidative
stress, and apoptotic cell death in both mono- and co-cultured cells.
ROS formation was significantly induced in both mono- and co-cultured
C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells after exposure to CoCl2. However,
the level of ROS generation was lower in co-cultured C2C12 cells in
comparison to monocultured C2C12 cells. On the other hand, the 3T3-L1
co-cultured cells showed more ROS generation in comparison to monocultured
3T3-L1 cells. An enhancement in intracellular ROS has been reported
in different cell types after exposure to CoCl2.23,49 It has been previously noted in diverse cell types that ROS formation
acts directly on the mitochondria and accelerates the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential. However, the signaling pathway remains provocative
and there is some contradiction regarding CoCl2, which
can stimulate both the intrinsic23 and
extrinsic50,51 apoptosis pathways. There are some reports
showing that the ROS formation increases during the hypoxia condition,52,53 while others show a decrease.54,55 During hypoxia, the
expression of HIF-1 was found to be increased, which regulates the
mitochondrial activity,56 and precisely
ROS formation.18,53,57 However, few studies also showed an increase in ROS generation with
a reduction in the expression of HIF-1.58,59

GSH
forms within the cells having thiol groups and is affected
by CoCl2 exposure.60 GSH maintains
the redox homeostasis by protecting the cells from oxidative damage.
However, we detected the depletion of GSH in both mono- and co-cultured
cells receiving exposure of CoCl2, but the enormity of
diminution was statistically larger in the monocultured C2C12 cells
in comparison to co-cultured C2C12 cells. The monocultured 3T3-L1
cells have less depletion in the level of GSH in comparison to co-cultured
3T3-L1 cells. Thus, the depletion of GSH levels in both mono- and
co-cultured cells could be accredited to the enlarged consumption
of GSH-GPx in detoxification of H2O2 produced
by CoCl2. The cells were able to repair the oxidative cellular
damage by some cellular defense mechanism(s) that significantly subordinate
the amount of free-radical species formed during excessive production
of ROS. However, the mitochondrial respiration has been inhibited
by the increased ROS formation that induces lipid peroxidation.61 In the present study, a significantly high intensity
of LPO was ascertained after exposure to CoCl2. The failure
in cell viability was also found subsequent to the introduction of
CoCl2 in both mono- and co-cultured cells.

During
the oxidative stress condition, cells undergo apoptosis
and are regulated by a caspase cascade. The signaling pathway of apoptosis
is regulated by affirmative and pessimistic regulators, and the equilibrium
among these regulators resolves whether the cells undergo apoptosis
or survive. The cells survive if the expression of antiapoptotic genes
such as Bcl2 and Bcl-xL increases, whereas the cells undergo programmed
cell death if the expression of proapoptotic genes Bax, Bad, Bak,
and Bid increased. CoCl2 induces the expression of p53
via ROS-mediated DNA damage.62 p53 upregulates
the expression of PUMA, p21, and Bax in response to various stresses.
Several reports have shown that p53 moves to the mitochondria in reaction
to stress.63 Subsequently, mitochondrial
signaling is triggered, ensuing in the cytoplasmic discharge of cytochrome c, pro-caspase-9, etc., which stimulates the activation
of caspase-9 and then caspase-364,65 HIF-1α can induce
apoptosis by increasing the immovability of the artifact of the tumor
suppressor gene p53. In oxidative stress or DNA damage, p53 induces
apoptosis or growth arrest by regulating Bax or p21, respectively.
Several studies have demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro conditions
wherein HIF-1α binds straight to the p53 ubiquitin ligase mdm2
and subsequently stabilizes p53.66 However,
other studies showed through obligatory of p53 to the oxygen-dependent
degradation domain of HIF1a.

In the current study, we found
that the introduction of CoCl2 to both mono and co-cultured
cells significantly increased
the expression of HIF-1, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and p53 and decreased
the expression of Bcl2. Several studies have shown that mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization and apoptosis have been initiated by an
increase in the level of cytosolic p53 protein after interaction with
the mitochondria. It has been proposed that the cytosolic p53 protein
induces the proapoptotic gene such as Bax and shifts the antiapoptotic
Bcl2 protein.67 However, the genotoxicity
has been prevented by the induction of nuclear p53 protein, which
finally leads to controlled cell death.68,69 Hence, p53
prompts the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade in both types of cultured
cells in this study by changing the expression profile of marker genes
after exposure to CoCl2.

The benefit of co-culture
related to monoculture is its capability
to expose the in vivo biology of growth factors, cytokines, and transcriptional
regulators either activated or withdrawn in retort to any stress or
disease condition. For example, Li et al.70 reported that the synthesis of IL-6 in the intestinal epithelial
cells is directly affected by the monocyte-derived IL-10. This was
supposed to pay for disease development through mucin production and
cell migration.70 The co-culture models
are used for essential narrative epithelial cell function during disease
and regeneration of biological barriers of wound repair. Fibroblasts
need to cleave the mature peptide formed between laminin-5-attached
basal epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in epidermal
tissues. This stimulates integration into ECM to allow stronger epithelial
layer attachment.71 Co-culture has been
shown to regenerate the epithelial cells by stimulating the fibroblasts
more powerfully in comparison to monolayer culture.72 This reveals the assistance of fibroblasts in epithelial
hurdle renewal and highlights the importance of co-cultures for the
swot of wound repair.

The present study demonstrates that apoptosis
was decreased in
C2C12 cells when they were co-cultured with 3T3-L1 cells in comparison
to monocultured C2C12 cells in the presence of CoCl2. The
reason may be either activation or repression of many growth factors,
cytokines, and transcriptional regulators in co-culture systems.70 Nevertheless, the possessions of adipocytes
on myocytes are still not established and the fundamental mechanism
is uncertain. Wang et al.73 reported that
the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis has been inhibited
in co-culturing of macrophages with DMCs. Apoptosis was induced by
LPS in both mono- and co-cultured cells, and they found that the co-cultured
cells show 4 times less apoptosis in comparison to monocultured cells
in the presence of DMC. On the other hand, C2C12 cells induce apoptosis
in 3T3-L1 cells when co-cultured with differentiated C2C12 cells during
the hypoxic condition. Chu et al.74 has
reported that the co-culture experiment showed proliferation, cell
cycle and differentiation of 3T3-L1 were arrested and apoptosis was
induced by differentiated C2C12 myoblast.

Conclusions
Our study reveals that exposure to CoCl2 significantly
induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) in both
mono- and co-cultured cell systems. The increased ROS formation leads
to oxidative damage in the cells during the hypoxic condition. The
ratio of Bcl2/Bax has been reduced due to the increased ROS generation
upregulation of p53 gene, and downregulaion of Bcl2 gene. Cytochrome c has been released due to alteration in the ratio of Bcl2/Bax,
which finally activates caspase-9 and consequently prompts the caspase-3
cascade, leading to apoptosis in both mono- and co-cultured cells.
However, the monocultured C2C12 cells respond significantly high toward
the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress after exposure to CoCl2. While the co-cultured C2C12 cells also show the oxidative stress
toward CoCl2 exposure, the magnitude is lower in comparison
to monoculture cells. The co-cultured cells also show the protective
potential toward the oxidative stress-mediated cell death to some
extent. However, the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells respond higher toward
the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in comparison to monocultured
3T3-L1 cells.
