The increasing complexity of environmental
pollution nowadays poses
a severe threat to the public health, which attracts considerable
attentions in searching for nanomaterials of multiproperty. In this
study, mesoporous silica of KIT-6-encapsulated bismuth oxychloride
(BiOCl), an intrinsically multifunctional material exhibiting bunched
structure in the composites, are facilely prepared under hydrothermal
conditions. Subsequently, the produced materials of multifunctionality
were applied for photocatalysis, antibacterial test, and simultaneous
determination of heavy metals including lead and cadmium. A combination
of physiochemical characterizations have revealed that the BiOCl–KIT-6
composites exhibit enlarged yet refined surface morphology contributing
to the improved photocatalytic ability with a band gap of 3.06 eV
at a molecular ratio of 8Bi–Si. Moreover, the antibacterial
activities of our BiOCl–KIT-6 composites were explored, and
possible antimicrobial mechanism related to the production of reactive
oxygen species was discussed. Furthermore, a sensitive electrochemical
determination of heavy metals of lead and cadmium using square-wave
anodic stripping voltammetry was also achieved. The composites-modified
glassy carbon electrode displays a linear range of calibration curve
from 0.2 to 300 μg/L with a detection limit of 0.05 μg/L
(Pb2+) and 0.06 μg/L (Cd2+), respectively.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, due to its increasing complexity of origins, environmental
pollution such as industrial discharge of heavy metals or dyes resistant
to degradation or infectious microbes remains a severe concern for
public health.1−4 The available methods such as chlorination and UV irradiation, devoid
of microbial contamination, used in water disinfection are limited
because of the harmful disinfection byproducts5,6 or
the cautious operating conditions.

Recently, multifunctional
nanomaterials have attracted considerable
concerns because of their enormous potentials in diverse applications
in industry and biomedicine, such as degradation and detection of
environmental contaminants and targeted drug delivery.7−10 To confer the multifunctionality of materials such as optical, electronic,
magnetic, and thermal properties,11−14 many efforts have been made on
tuning the microstructure of the constituent or constructing hybrid
nanomaterials, which usually involves relatively delicate chemical
conjugations and thus may be difficult to achieve.15 To tackle environmental problems, a search for economical,
efficient, and biosafe material with intrinsic multifunctionality
is demanding.16

Bismuth materials
have long been regarded as green materials because
of their eco-friendliness. In particular, owing to its large surface
area, extraordinary electronic transport properties, and high electrocatalytic
activities, layered bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) has been extensively
studied especially for industrial purpose.17,18 Notably, due to its nontoxic nature, BiOCl has also been involved
in biomedical practice.19,20 It was reported that
bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), the active ingredient of an antacid drug
named Pepto-Bismol that was approved to sell for over a century in
the USA, is hydrolyzed into BiOCl in the human body to effectively
treat diarrhea and stomach upsets.21,22 However, the
layered microstructure of BiOCl is not ideal for a batch production
that may preclude its further practical applications.

Porous
silica materials such as KIT-6 (Korea Advanced Institute
of Science and Technology-6), SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous-15),
and MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter-41) have demonstrated an ordered
mesostructure, which is ideal for applications such as the construction
of matrixes for drug delivery, molecular probes, and catalyst.23−26 In addition, due to the structural composition of regular mesopores,
mesoporous silica materials have been used as templates to fabricate
nanomaterials.27 Among the mesoporous silica
materials, KIT-6 shows advantageous features for the structural modifications28 because of large tunable pores with thick pore
walls, high hydrothermal stability, high specific surface area, and
large pore volume. Therefore, we set out to integrate the intrinsically
multifunctional BiOCl on modular KIT-6 support aimed at producing
BiOCl of defined morphology and test the potential photocatalytic/electrochemical
as well as antibacterial activity of composite.

In this study,
a multifunctional BiOCl–KIT-6 composite with
defined mesostructure was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal
method. Because of the intrinsic multiproperty of BiOCl, the obtained
BiOCl/mesoporous silica composites were physiochemically characterized
and applied for electrochemical stripping analysis of heavy metals
of human blood samples, photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B,
and antibacterial assay. In the antibacterial test, two typical kinds
of bacteria including the Gram-positive (G+) and the Gram-negative
(G–) ones were used, and possible antimicrobial
mechanism was discussed.

2 Results and Discussions
The surface morphology of the prepared materials is illustrated
in Figures 1a–e
and S1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images revealed that the obtained BiOCl on siliceous support is composed
of microspheres with a diameter of about 4 μm (Figure 1a). The BiOCl–KIT-6
composites are relatively large with size distributions about tens
of micrometers (Figure 1b), which display bunched structure in comparison with the layered
assembly of BiOCl. This observation may suggest a confining role of
amorphous KIT-6 (Figure S1) during the
formation of bunched structured BiOCl contributing to its enlarged
surface area, which is favorable for the incorporation and transfer
of substances. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides additional
structural information about the in situ growth of the BiOCl nanoplates
on the supporting KIT-6. Because of the phase contrast, at the edge
of KIT-6 supports, the visible distribution of BiOCl particles in
the composites were observed (Figure 1c–e), demonstrating the well-formation of BiOCl
particles on the KIT-6 mesopores.

XPS spectra of BiOCl–KIT-6 and (inset) high-resolution Bi 4f
region.

To estimate the surface elemental
configurations of materials,
an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed.
The resulting XPS spectra of BiOCl–KIT-6 showed that the surface
elements of composites mainly contain Bi, Cl, O, and negligible amount
of absorbed C from the ambient atmosphere (Figure 1f). The O 1s core peak locates at 528.3 eV,
which is attributed to O2– from a bismuth–oxygen
bond in BiOCl as well as the Cl 2p peak with the binding energy at
about 197.0 eV.29 The Bi 4f region (inset)
of the composite was composed of two well-separated peaks located
at 158.2 and 163.5 eV corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi
4f5/2 spin–orbit components, respectively, which
is similar to that of pure BiOCl.29 This
phenomenon suggests that the composite formation may avoid strong
chemical bonding between silica matrix and BiOCl. The calculated atom
percentage of surface Si in the composites was 8.67%, and the corresponding
atomic ratio of Bi–Si was 4.1:1 that is close to the theoretical
ratio of 6:1, which suggested that some amount of BiOCl were encapsulated
into the siliceous mesopores.30

The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BiOCl, KIT-6, and composites
were recorded. The wide-angle XRD spectra of composites pointed out
the presence of well-crystallized BiOCl phase with characteristic
diffraction peaks of the tetragonal matlockite phase of BiOCl (JCPDS
06-0249) (Figure S2A), of which the peak
intensities are decreasing in the presence of KIT-6. The Raman scattering
spectrum of BiOCl–KIT-6 recorded with a laser wavelength of
633 nm is shown in Figure S2B. Three dominant
peaks at 201, 145, and 62 cm–1 were observed, of
which the bands at 62 and 145 cm–1 are assigned
to the A1g internal Bi–Cl stretching mode and the
band at 201 cm–1 is assigned to the Eg internal Bi–Cl stretching mode. Whereas Eg external
Bi–Cl stretching was not identified likely because of the strong
scattering at 145 cm–1.31,32

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms for
pure
KIT-6, BiOCl, and composites are depicted in Figure 2. The KIT-6 isotherms exhibited well-defined
type IV isotherm characteristics of mesoporous silica materials.28 The isotherms of BiOCl show steady type IV isotherms
with H3-type hysteresis loops reflecting the sheet structure. The
composite showed a steep step of N2 adsorption–desorption
at a relative pressure of 0.6–1.0 indicating the partial retaining
of the mesoporous structure. The resulting textural properties of
the samples (BET surface area, pore volume, and pore size) are outlined
in Table S1. The presence of KIT-6 in the
composites induced a marked increase of surface area and pore volume
with an evident decrease of pore size, which accord well with the
SEM results. BJH pore size distributions were also obtained (as shown
in Figure 2b,d,f).
The narrow and sharp pore size distribution of KIT-6 was observed
indicating a regularity of mesopores. The pore size of BiOCl was distributed
widely in the range of 10–30 nm arising from its composition
of sheet structure. As expected, the maximum pore size of the composite
was increased, verifying its incorporation of BiOCl.

isotherms (a,c,e) and
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution
(b,d,f) of produced materials. The specific surface areas and pore
size distribution of samples were calculated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and BJH methods, respectively.

We first tested the photocatalytic performance of composites
by
the decomposition of RhB under UV light irradiation.33 The ratio of RhB concentration C relative
to initial concentration C0 (C/C0) versus the degradation time is plotted
in Figure 3a. There
are two factors involved in the photodegradation of RhB including
the adsorption of RhB onto the surface of photocatalyst and photoassisted
reaction.34 As shown in Figure 3a, few dyes were degraded within
90 min in cases of KIT-6 and controls. When BiOCl was incorporated
in the composites, the concentration of RhB decreased significantly
under light exposure attributing to the high photoactivity of xBiOCl–KIT-6 (the adsorption spectral changes of
RhB over 8Bi–Si are shown in Figure S3). Considering the excessive absorbent in the solution, the photodegradation
kinetics of RhB can be fitted with a pseudo-first-order function35 as described below. 1  where C is the concentration
of RhB remaining in the solution after irradiation and C0 is the initial concentration of RhB. Figure 3b presented the plots of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time
for the degradations of RhB. The calculated apparent rate constants
(ka) for the degradations of RhB are outlined
in Figure 3c. As shown
in Table S2, the apparent rate constants
of RhB over BiOCl, 6Bi–Si, 8Bi–Si, and 10Bi–Si
were 0.0156, 0.0158, 0.0140, and 0.0097 min–1, respectively.
From these results, we concluded that 8Bi–Si sample exhibited
the maximized photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB with
the calculated ka of ∼1.6 times
of that over BiOCl indicating that the bunched structured of BiOCl
on the mesopore support may facilitate the catalyzing of photons of
RhB molecules. Additionally, 8Bi–Si sample with enlarged surface
area favored both absorption and photodegradation of RhB.

reflectance spectra of the obtained materials ((i) 10Bi–Si;
(ii) BiOCl; (iii) 8Bi–Si; and (iv) KIT-6) and (inset) plot
of (αhν)1/2 vs photon energy
for 8Bi–Si and BiOCl.

To study the electronic state of the obtained samples, we
further
performed UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Figure 3d). The UV–vis
spectrum of KIT-6 showed visible absorption bands in the range of
200–300 nm. Compared to pure KIT-6, all BiOCl and composites
exhibit strong light adsorption (<370 nm) as previously reported,36 confirming the presence of BiOCl. The spectra
were also used to calculate the band gap according to Kubelka–Munk
transformation.31 A plot of [αhν]1/2 (α denotes the absorption
coefficient) versus the photon energy of 8Bi–Si resulted in
a band gap of 3.06 eV lower than that of BiOCl (3.12 eV), which is
correlated to its improved photocatalytic performance.

As mentioned
above, BiOCl is a major decomposed product of BSS
drug in the gastrointestinal tract that treats dyspepsia and diarrhea
effectively.21 We reasoned that BiOCl–KIT-6
may exhibit some antibiosis properties. To this end, we investigated
the antibacterial activities of BiOCl–KIT-6 against Gram-positive
bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and Gram-negative
bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. According
to our study, the antibacterial activity of BiOCl–KIT-6 composites
against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) is not effective.
However, the antibacterial effect of BiOCl–KIT-6 composites
against Gram-positive ones (S. aureus and E. faecalis) was pronounced (Figure S4). Notably, 6Bi–Si composite
has the maximized antibacterial activity against Gram-positive S. aureus, and the inhibition rate is up to 96.6%
much higher than 10Bi–Si (77.7%), 8Bi–Si (91.5%), BiOCl
(78.3%), and KIT-6 (52.5%), which is attributed to the mesoporous
KIT-6 support favoring the antibiosis effect of BiOCl. The minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6Bi–Si toward S. aureus and E. faecalis were generally observed to be 32 and 40 μg/mL, respectively,
which corroborates the antibacterial activities of 6Bi–Si.

To further study the antibacterial properties of bismuth-based
mesoporous silica materials, three types of materials named BiOCl,
6Bi–Si, and KIT-6 were added individually into LB liquid media
of S. aureus, and the growth curves
achieved are shown in Figure 4. In the presence of 20 μg/mL BiOCl or KIT-6 the growth
curve of S. aureus cells is similar
to those in just LB media, suggesting that neither BiOCl nor KIT-6
has observable antibacterial activity under the tested condition.
An apparent decrease in the growth curve was observed when adding
6Bi–Si, which agreed well with the results of MIC experiment.

curves of S. aureus cultured
in Luria Bertani (LB) media containing 20 μg/mL BiOCl, 6Bi–Si,
and KIT-6 suspensions. Each data point is the average of three independent
assays with the standard error of the mean.

The ability of the xBi–Si composites
to
prevent viable bacteria colonization was also verified by fluorescence
staining as shown in Figure 5. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, there were large
amounts of viable bacteria in blank, KIT-6, and BiOCl suspensions
and relatively small amount of living bacteria in those xBi–Si suspensions (Figure 5d–f). The ratios of dead cells (ethidium bromide
labeled) to total cells are counted as 19.5% (KIT-6), 50.2% (BiOCl),
67.1% (6Bi–Si), 53.2% (8Bi–Si), and 51.9% (10Bi–Si),
of which 6Bi–Si suspension exhibited the most cytocidal effect
(Figure 5d).

images showing viability of the S.
aureus bacteria in blank (a), KIT-6 (b), BiOCl (c),
6Bi–Si (d), 8Bi–Si (e), and 10Bi–Si (f) suspensions
of 20 μg/mL after incubation at 37 °C for 16 h with the
fluorescent dye of acridine orange and ethidium bromide. The live
bacteria appear green, whereas the dead ones turn orange. The ratio
of fluorescent cells of living (green) and dead (orange) status was
calculated by manual counting under a microscope.

The documented literature illustrated that the toxicity of
nanomaterials
on bacteria may be related to the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS accumulation was detected in S. aureus cells using the fluorogenic dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFDA) based on the oxidation of the nonfluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(DCFH) into the green highly
fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF). This reaction is considered
to give a general indication of ROS levels, since DCFH reacts with
H2O2, O2–, and ONOO–. As shown in Figure S5, S. aureus incubated with xBi–Si,
BiOCl, and KIT-6 showed more green fluorescence compared with the
untreated group (negative control), indicating that ROS were formed
and may induce the cell death. We also found that the bacteria treated
by 6Bi–Si, 8Bi–Si, 10Bi–Si, BiOCl, and KIT-6
resulted in the formation of DCF+ with a conversion ratio
of 92.6, 76.9, 53.4, 68.2, and 38.6%, respectively, which was consistent
with the antibacterial assay results (Figures 4 and 5). Similarly,
the cells treated with 25 mM H2O2 as the positive
control also exhibited green fluorescence (Figure S5). These results may point out a molecular mechanism of intracellular
ROS formation involved with the bacterial S. aureus growth, that is, oxidative stress response, in the presence of BiOCl–KIT-6.
Nevertheless, compared with G–E.
coli consisting of a thin membrane of peptidoglycan
and an outer membrane, G+S. aureus does not possess the outer membrane that is more vulnerable for
the uptake of foreign chemical substances. A possible membrane-disruption
process in the presence of mesocomposites may also occur to induce
the cell death.

For the simultaneous anodic stripping voltammetry
(ASV) analysis
of lead and cadmium using BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE, we optimized three
key operational parameters including pH of acetate buffer, deposition
potential, and assay time. The electrochemical stripping voltammetric
responses of BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE are recorded in Figure S6. The optimal analytical parameters for ASV in the
simultaneous determination of Pb2+ and Cd2+ obtained
by BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE are outlined in Table 1. Compared with bare glassy carbon electrode
(GCE) and BiOCl/GCE, BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE achieved higher stripping
peak currents of 100 μg/L Pb2+ and 100 μg/L
Cd2+ (Figure S7), which was
probably attributed to the better formation of bismuth–lead–cadmium
alloys on mesoporous KIT-6 supports.37

Under the optimized conditions given in Table 1, the obtained stripping curves
of Pb2+ and Cd2+ using BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE
are shown
in Figure 6a. The calibration
curves of the simultaneous determination of Pb2+ and Cd2+ displayed two linear ranges from 0.2 to 10 and 10 to 300
μg/L with regression equations of y = 0.0263x + 0.7491 (R2 = 0.9936, [Pb2+] > 10 μg/L), y = 0.0785x + 0.3624 (R2 = 0.9955, [Pb2+] ≤ 10 μg/L), y = 0.00995x + 0.6132 (R2 = 0.9983, [Cd2+] > 10 μg/L), and y = 0.0412x + 0.3010 (R2 = 0.9986, [Cd2+] ≤ 10 μg/L), where y and x are the peak currents (μA) and heavy metal concentrations
(μg/L), respectively (Figure 6b). The resulting limit of detection (LOD) is 0.05
μg/L (Pb2+) and 0.06 μg/L (Cd2+),
respectively, calculated by the equation of LOD = 3sy/x/a, where sy/x is the standard error of the regression curve and a is the slope of the regression curve.38 The analytical performance of our constructed sensor in
comparison with the previous reports based on bismuth film-modified
electrodes for the simultaneous determination of lead and cadmium
is summarized in Table 2. Therefore, by using BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE, a relatively wide range
of linear calibration curves and low LODs were obtained for the simultaneous
determination of lead and cadmium compared with those in the earlier
reports.39,40

We further
used the standard addition approach on BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE
for the simultaneous determination of lead and cadmium in blood samples.
The blood samples were collected from the local hospital following
the guidelines. Under the same optimal stripping parameters on BiOCl–KIT-6/GCEs,
the reasonable recovery of simultaneous determination of Pb2+ (96.8–104.4%) and Cd2+ (95.2–103.6%) in
blood samples by ASV was achieved, validating the accuracy of our
Bi-based sensor for the simultaneous determination of lead and cadmium
in blood samples. The interference study was performed by adding some
interfering heavy metal ions including Zn2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, and Sn2+ in 20-fold excess with standard
solution of analytes containing 100 μg/L Pb2+ and
100 μg/L Cd2+.

Under the optimal assay conditions,
the obtained square-wave anodic
stripping voltammetry (SWASV) response currents of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in the absence (I0) and presence (Ii) of interfering metal
ions and relative signal changes (Ii/I0 – 1) are shown in Table 3. It was found that the peak
currents of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in the presence of
interfering metal ions changed slightly with the relative signal value
from −6.7 to +4.1%, suggesting a satisfying selectivity for
the simultaneous determination of lead and cadmium. Moreover, as we
tested, the BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE was capable of the repeated usage
for at least 2 weeks. Therefore, the constructed BiOCl-based sensor
provides a practical, easy, and accurate way for the simultaneous
determination of lead and cadmium in blood samples.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have successfully synthesized the BiOCl–KIT-6
composites by a facile, in situ hydrothermal method. In particular,
the prepared BiOCl–KIT-6 composites demonstrated the multifunctional
character in photocatalysis, antibacterial activity, and simultaneous
determination of lead and cadmium by ASV. The obtained composites
exhibited an improved photocatalytic performance in degrading rhodamine
B and pronounced antibacterial activities against Gram-positive S. aureus and E. faecalis. Moreover, the BiOCl–KIT-6 composite-modified GCE was applied
for the anodic stripping analysis of the simultaneous detection of
lead and cadmium with the linear range of 0.2–300 μg/L
and a detection limit of 0.05 μg/L (Pb2+) and 0.06
μg/L (Cd2+), respectively, which is applicable for
the simultaneous detection of lead and cadmium in real blood samples.
It should be noted that the overall photocatalytic performance of
composites was not remarkable compared with other bismuth-based materials.44 Therefore, it is anticipated that the BiOCl–KIT-6
composites upon further structural modification will lead to the broad
use for environmental and analytical purposes.

4.1 Materials and Preparation of BiOCl–KIT-6
Composites
All chemicals were used as received. Perfluorinated
sulfonic acid ester (Nafion) and ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. A triblock copolymer of
Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (China). GCE (Φ = 3 mm) was purchased
from Tianjin Incole Union Technology Co., Ltd, China. The standard
solutions (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ca, Co, Mg, Fe, Ni, and Sn) were purchased
from NACIS, China. The preparation of KIT-6 was synthesized as reported.28,45 The BiOCl–KIT-6 composites were obtained by a facile and
in situ hydrothermal method. Briefly, 1.5 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was fully dissolved in 30 mL EG
at 25 °C before adding 0.2 mmol KIT-6. The mixture was further
stirred for 30 min, and 10 mmol NaCl was introduced. Then, the mixture
was heated at 170 °C for 6 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave and cooled down to collect the product. The product was
centrifuged and washed with distilled water for several times and
then dried at 60 °C for 5 h. The composite materials of xBiOCl/KIT-6 (the molar ratio of Bi–Si of x = 6, 8, and 10) were labeled as 6Bi–Si, 8Bi–Si,
and 10Bi–Si, respectively, in the text.

The XRD patterns
were obtained from SmartLab TM 9 kW diffractometer using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The SEM images were taken on a Hitachi
SU-1510 microscope using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The TEM
images were collected on a JEOL-1010 microscope operated at 200 kV.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe
XPS system. The contaminant carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV) was used as the
calibration reference for all binding energies. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were performed on an ASAP-2020 Micromeritics volumetric
adsorption analyzer. The Raman spectra were recorded on a DRX spectrometer.
The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples were obtained
on a LAMBDA 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The electrochemical
experiment was run on a CHI760D electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode
system including GCE modified with BiOCl–KIT-6 as a working
electrode.

4.3 Photocatalytic Degradation
Reactions
Photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated
by the photocatalytic
decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB). Typically, 30 mg of powder (10Bi–Si,
8Bi–Si, 6Bi–Si, BiOCl, and KIT-6) was added stepwise
into the RhB solution (30 mL, 10 mg/L), which was irradiated with
a 500 W Xe arc lamp equipped with a UV light (λ ≤ 420
nm). The suspension was stirred to reach the sorption equilibrium
of dye molecules on the surface of the photocatalyst. At certain time
intervals, 2 mL aliquot was pipetted out for the measurement.

4.4 Antibacterial Assay and ROS Detection
Before the antibacterial
test, all of the materials and reagents
in the experiments were sterilized at 120 °C for 20 min. The
bacteria including S. aureus (S. aureus ATCC 6538), E. faecalis (E. faecalis FA2-2), E. coli (E. coli ATCC
25922), and P. aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa PAO1) were cultured in the LB liquid
medium at 37 °C for 16 h. The antibacterial activities of BiOCl–KIT-6
toward E. coli and S.
aureus were evaluated by the colony-counting method.
The colony-counting test was performed by mixing 2 mL of 105 CFU/mL diluted bacterial suspension with 2 mL of BiOCl–KIT-6
(32 μg/mL) dissolved in LB liquid medium followed by a 16 h-incubation
at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. Then, 10 μL of the mixture
was plated onto LB agar plates, and the number of the colonies was
counted after 24 h. Plates containing only medium or bacterial suspension
were also prepared as controls. The inhibition rate of composites
was calculated by (N0 – NS)/N0, where N0 and NS represent
the number of the colonies on LB agar plates in the absence and presence
of produced materials samples (6Bi–Si, 8Bi–Si, 10Bi–Si,
BiOCl, or KIT-6), respectively. The MIC value was determined by mixing
2 mL of 105 CFU/mL bacterial suspensions with 2 mL of 6Bi–Si
of different concentrations in the range of 1–128 μg/mL
into the tubes and incubated for 16 h. Control tubes containing only
6Bi–Si suspension, LB liquid media, and diluted bacterial suspension
without materials were also prepared. To investigate the growth experiments,
we chose S. aureus as a model. BiOCl
(20 μg/mL), 6Bi–Si, and KIT-6 were added to the LB liquid
media and then 105 CFU/mL bacterial suspensions were added
to the culture at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. The bacterial
growth rates were determined over 24 h by measuring the optical density
at 600 nm by a UV–vis spectrophotometer. To further look at
the viability of bacteria when different materials were induced, the
bacteria were cultured as mentioned above. The culture medium was
then removed and the 20 μg/mL materials were rinsed with PBS,
stained using acridine orange and ethidium bromide, and observed by
a fluorescence microscope. Ethidium bromide stained only the dead
cells, whereas acridine orange can penetrate the membrane and thus
stain the viable and dead cells. Therefore, the living cells appeared
green, whereas the dead ones were orange under the fluorescent microscope.46−48

The cellular toxicity of BiOCl–KIT-6 related to reactive
oxygen species (ROS) formation has been evaluated using a conventional
DCFDA assay,49 in which S. aureus cells were treated with the composites
of altered molar ratio of Bi–Si, and the resulting fluorescence
of dye DCFDA were recorded using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss
MTB2004, Germany). The ratios of DCF+-labeled cells in
different treated groups were calculated by manually counting under
a microscope.

4.5 Electrochemical Measurement
SWASV
was performed for the simultaneous analysis of lead and cadmium using
BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE as the working electrode. To construct the
BiOCl–KIT-6/GCE, the composite was first dispersed in the permselective
membrane of the Nafion solution (1%, v/v), which was capable of reducing
the surface contamination of electrode. Aliquots (10 μL) were
dropped on the GCE and dried at room temperature. Then, the test buffer
was made to stand for 20 s before the stripping curve was recorded
at the frequency of 20 Hz and amplitude of 25 mV under room temperature.

4.6 Pretreatment of Real Blood Samples
To minimize
the matrix effect of samples,42 the whole
blood samples of humans were treated based on the U.S.
EPA Method 3050B with some modifications. Typically, 1 mL of the whole
blood was digested and heated for 5 h close to dryness with concentrated
HNO3. Subsequently, 1 mL of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.0)
was added for the analysis. For the calibration, standard Pb and Cd
solutions were spiked into blood samples.
