To meet growing demand
of energy, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
are under enormous attention. The development of well-designed ternary
transition metal oxides with high capacity and high stability is important
and challengeable for using as electrode materials for LIBs. Herein,
a new and highly reversible carbon-coated Cu-Co bimetal oxide composite
material (CuxCo3–xO4/C) with a one-dimensional (1D) porous rod-like
structure was prepared through a bimetal–organic framework
(BMOF) template strategy followed by a morphology-inherited annealing
treatment. During the annealing process, carbon derived from organic
frameworks in situ fully covered the synthesized bimetal oxide nanoparticles,
and a large number of porous spaces were generated in the MOF-derived
final samples, thus ensuring high electrical conductivity and fast
ion diffusion. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of bimetals,
the unique 1D porous structure, and conductive carbon network, the
as-synthesized CuxCo3–xO4/C delivers a high capacity retention
up to 92.4% after 100 cycles, with a high reversible capacity still
maintained at 900 mA h g–1, indicating an excellent
cycling stability. Also, a good rate performance is demonstrated.
These outstanding electrochemical properties show us a concept of
synthesis of MOF-derived bimetal oxides combining both advantages
of carbon incorporation and porous structure for progressive lithium-ion
batteries.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As
one of the most promising technologies to solve the heavy consumption
of fossil fuel resources and serious environmental problems, Li-ion
batteries (LIBs) have been used as an advanced and portable source
of electricity for various applications.1−5 However, the specific energy of conventional LIBs is not sufficient
for these applications due to the limited specific capacity of the
conventional graphite anode (372 mA h g–1).6−8 Many research studies have been carried out to find new electrode
materials with high energy density or high capacity.9,10 Among those materials, Co3O4, a transition
metal oxide (TMO), owing to its complex electron transfer reaction
upon cycling, exhibits excellent potential for its high specific capacities
(nearly 1000 mA h g–1).11,12

Recently, in consideration of the nonenvironmentally friendliness,
expensiveness, and high-lithium redox potential (2.2–2.4 V
vs Li/Li+) of Co, some other eco-friendly and cheaper transition
metal atoms, such as Zn,13,14 Mn,15−17 Ni,18 and Cu, have been used to replace Co partially
to form ternary metal oxides. By replacing Co with cheaper and more
conductive Cu, the obtained Cu-Co bimetal oxides present an improved
electronic conductivity and higher electrochemical activity than the
single copper or cobalt oxide and thus proved to be excellent electrode
materials for LIBs. Sharma et al. synthesized CuCo2O4 as an anode material for LIBs with a reversible capacity
of 755 mA h g–1 at a current of 60 mA g–1.19 Sun et al. reported a mesoporous CuCo2O4 structure; after six cycles, it still retained
its capacity of 900 mA h g–1 at 60 mA g–1.20 Although these reported CuCo2O4 electrodes present a much higher capacity than that
of the conventional graphite, due to the large volume expansion with
cycling and relatively poor electrical conductivity, the cycling stability,
Coulombic efficiencies, and rate performance of Cu-Co bimetal oxides
need to be further improved.

So far, researchers have done much
effort to solve these problems.
One effective method is to produce rational porous nanostructures,
which can provide additional channels for fast diffusion of lithium
ions. Meanwhile, it can alleviate the structural strain induced by
the lithium insertion/extraction process.21 Second, combining the transition metal oxides with more conductive
carbon materials is another well-established strategy for enhancing
the electrochemical performance of TMOs. Since carbon is in the composite,
the volume expansion of TMOs could be restrained, and the cycling
stability of the electrode material could be enhanced effectively.
Moreover, the improved electrical conductivity of the electrode usually
leads to an enhanced rate capability. Kang et al. indicated that the
capacity of the CuCo2O4 nanocube encapsulated
by reduced graphite oxide sheet was almost two times higher than that
of pure CuCo2O4 nanocube.22 Recently, Zhang et al. utilized an electrospinning method
to synthesize CuCo2O4/C nanofibers, which present
an excellent cycling stability with a high capacity of 865 mA h g–1 after 400 cycles.23 Motivated
by these progresses, combining the above two strategies to fabricate
carbon incorporated Cu-Co bimetal oxide composite materials with a
well-designed porous structure will be a promising method to improve
the electrochemical performance. However, synthesis of such porous
structured composite materials is still facing challenges.

In
this work, we report a rational design and fabrication of CuxCo3–xO4/C composite with a porous rod-like structure by using bimetal–organic
frameworks (BMOFs) as the precursors and then calcination at a certain
temperature. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed
from supramolecular assembly of metal ions or clusters and organic
ligands, which are well known for their diverse porosity and architectural
structures.24−26 Inspired by their excellent configuration, MOFs are
usually considered as the multifunctional templates and precursors
for the preparation of new porous nanostructured materials with high
surface area and graded pore distribution, basically through thermal
decomposition. In addition, by accurately adjusting and controlling
MOF precursors and calcination conditions, the structure and composition
of MOF-derived nanomaterials can be easily adjusted and optimized
to achieve excellent electrochemical properties as LIB anodes.27−30 Specially, we made use of the organic frameworks to generate a microcrystal
precursor with a well-designed rod-like structure, which then transformed
to morphology-kept bimetal oxides during annealing in insert atmosphere.
Attributed to the annealing process, a large number of porous spaces
were generated in the MOF-derived final products because of the carbonization
or graphitization of organic ligands in MOFs during annealing treatment.
Most importantly, carbonized and graphitizated carbon originated from
organic frameworks would in situ fully cover these metal oxide nanoparticles,
which can not only improve the electronic conductivity of electrode
materials but also protect the electrode materials against destruction
during the charge/discharge process. The obtained CuxCo3–xO4/C
particles connect each other and form a porous rod-like structure,
ensuring fast diffusion of Li+/electrons. Owing to the
unique structural and compositional features, the CuxCo3–xO4/C
presents a high-lithium storage capacity (900 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles and a high capacity retention up to 92.4% with
respect to the initial discharge capacity of 974.1 mA h g–1) and excellent rate capability when evaluated as anode materials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of CuxCo3–xO4/C
Nanocomposites
The overall strategy for the fabrication of
porous rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C is clarified in Scheme 1. First, a facile solvothermal
method was used to synthesize Cu-Co-BTC precursors. Owing to the presence
of a carboxyl functional group (H3BTC), Co2+ and Cu2+ ions can easily connect it by complexation or
adsorption; thus, metal ions are uniformly distributed in these rod-like
MOF precursors, providing the metal sources for further preparation
of bimetal oxides. After annealing these MOF microcrystal precursors
in an inert atmosphere, the morphology-kept bimetal oxide/C composites
were obtained. The formation of porous rod-like structure is mainly
due to carbon and oxygen in organic ligands reacting to generate gas
to cause holes during the thermal decomposition of rod-like Cu-Co-BTC
precursor. Meanwhile, these synthesized bimetal oxide nanocrystals
are simultaneously covered by carbon derived from in situ carbonization
of the organic ligands. Combining the advantages of Cu-Co bimetal
oxide nanocrystals with a 1D rod-like structure, high porosity, and
well-conductive carbon network, the as-synthesized CuxCo3–xO4/C has great potential to exhibit outstanding electrochemical lithium
storage performance as an anode material for LIBs.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Fabrication of Porous Rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C Composites
The precursors of Cu and Co
with different molar proportions were
easily synthesized by a solvothermal reaction, which are denoted as
Cu-Co-BTC-n (n represents the molar
ratio of Cu to Co). Figure 1a shows a representative field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) image of Cu-Co-BTC-0.3. It can be seen that Cu-Co-BTC-0.3
presents a rod-like structure with a diameter around 1 μm and
a length close to 10 μm. High-magnification SEM image in Figure 1b reveals the detailed
structure of the rod, which actually consists of four prismatic planes
and a relatively smooth surface. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) investigation as shown in Figure 1c also reveals a solid structure for the Cu-Co-BTC-0.3
rods. The formation of bimetallic Cu-Co-BTC-0.3 is confirmed by elemental
mapping images (Figure 1d–h), which present a uniform distribution of elements of
Co, Cu, C, and O along the rods. Meanwhile, the amorphous nature of
Cu-Co-BTC-0.3 rods is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern, which is common for MOFs (Figure S1). We also took FESEM investigations for other Cu-Co-BTC-n samples with different Cu/Co molar ratios, and the results
are shown in Figure S2. Notably, when the
Cu/Co molar ratio is less than 0.1, the obtained Cu-Co-BTC still maintains
a typical sphere-like morphology as the reported single-metal Co-BTC.31,32 As the molar ratio increases, a rod-like structure for the Cu-Co-BTC
appears, and the diameter size increases accordingly, from 1 μm
for Cu-Co-BTC-0.3 to around 1.5–2 μm for Cu-Co-BTC-0.8.
These results reveal that the amount of Cu source plays an important
role in the formation of 1D rod-like Cu-Co-BTC-n.

Figure 1 (a, b)
FESEM images, (c) TEM image, and (d–h) corresponding
elemental mapping images of Cu-Co-BTC-0.3.

The thermal behavior of the Cu-Co-BTC-0.3 precursor was investigated
with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Figure S3, below 200 °C, there is a weight loss of 20%,
which may be attributed to the escape of DMF molecules and adsorbed
water. The subsequent weight loss of 49% under 400–550 °C
can be attributed to the oxidation of the BTC ligand and the decomposition
of the skeleton. To ensure complete conversion of precursors to oxide
products, 600 °C was selected as the calcination temperature
in the next process.

The morphologies of CuxCo3–xO4/C
samples obtained via calcination
of Cu-Co-BTC precursors were observed with FESEM and TEM. Figure 2 shows the morphology
features of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3. It can be seen that the annealed
products typically maintain almost the same size and rod-like morphology
as that of the MOF precursors (Figure 2a). Careful morphology observation by high-magnification
SEM (Figure 2a (inset),b)
reveals that the CuxCo3–xO4/C rods are composed of particles with
sizes varying from dozens to hundreds of nanometers. The surface of
these rods is highly rough and porous, which can be attributed to
the carbonization of organic ligands in the Cu-Co-BTC precursor during
the annealing process. The structure features of these CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 rods were further examined by TEM. The microstructure displayed
in Figure 2c shows
that the particles interconnects each other and form a 1D rod-like
structure, which corresponds to the SEM results (Figure 2a,b). Figure 2d shows a typical high-magnification TEM
image taken from the edge of CuxCo3–xO4/C nanoparticle. A
very thin carbon layer coated on the surface of the bimetal oxide
nanocrystals could be found. Besides, a lattice fringe with an interplanar
spacing of 0.28 nm could be clearly seen in the HRTEM image, which
is corresponding to the (220) lattice plane of spinel CuCo2O4. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
(Figure S4) also demonstrates the crystalline
feature of these particles. The elemental mapping shows the homogeneous
coexistence and highly uniform distribution of Cu, Co, O, and C within
one particle, confirming the composition of CuxCo3–xO4/C.
On the basis of these observations, it can be safely concluded that
the as-prepared Cu-Co MOF rods transformed into CuxCo3–xO4/C
composites at 600 °C in a N2 atmosphere. The carbon
shell is derived from carbonization of organic ligands, and the crystallized
bimetal oxide particles are encapsulated by the carbon wall, thus
forming a core–shell structure for each CuxCo3–xO4/C
particle. Since the carbon framework still maintains a 1D structural
characteristic, the CuxCo3–xO4/C particles interconnect each other
and form a porous rod-like structure. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurement was used to investigate the specific porous nature of
CuxCo3–xO4/C rods. As shown in Figure S5, the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 exhibits a type IV isotherm with a distinct
hysteresis loop in the relative pressure region of 0.5–1.0,
indicating a mesoporous feature. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) desorption analyses reveal a relatively wide pore size range
from 1 to 50 nm (inset in Figure S5). The
origination of pores may be attributed to the escape of gases via
the calcination of organic ligands. In addition, the composite is
assembled from small particles; these stacked particles may cause
some pores on the surface of the material. A high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 98.0 m2/g was also confirmed. As
we know, such a mesoporous structure could ensure efficient diffusion
of the electrolyte, and a high surface area may provide more electrochemical
active sites. We also studied the influences of Cu/Co molar ratio
on the structure of the product. These SEM results strongly support
that idea that the morphology of CuxCo3–xO4/C-n keeps the same character as that of Cu-Co-BTC-n precursors (Figures S2 and S6). As for
the obtained CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.8, it clearly displays a porous
rod-like structure composed of nanoparticles. While it cannot be ignored
that there are many disorderly packed CuxCo3–xO4/C particles,
they appear due to the destruction of the rod-like framework. Actually,
the thicker the rod, the easier it is to destroy the structure during
calcination.

images, (c) TEM image, (d) HRTEM image, and (e–i) EDS elemental
mapping images.

XRD patterns of the obtained
CuxCo3–xO4/C-n samples are shown in Figure 3. For all CuxCo3–xO4/C-n products, there
is a main phase of spinel CuCo2O4, and a secondary
phase CuO (JCPDS card no. 80-1917) could be observed. The relatively
sharp reflections located at 18°, 31°, 36°, 38°,
44°, 55°, 58°, and 64° can be well indexed to
the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes
of CuCo2O4 (JCPDS card no. 78-2177), respectively,
revealing a high crystallization. The cubic lattice parameter, assessed
by least-squares fitting of 2θ and (hkl), is a = 8.139(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the
value of 8.133(2) Å. Since the atomic diameter of Cu is bigger
than that of Co, the little higher diameter of the unit cell demonstrates
that the Cu atoms were completely incorporated into the Co3O4 lattice. No reflection peaks originated from the graphitized
carbon could be found, owing to the small amount of carbon. Meanwhile,
no other redundant peaks are observed, suggesting a high purity of
metal oxides.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were applied
to indicate the elemental composition and chemical bond of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 (Figure 4). The survey spectrum illustrated unique peaks of Cu, Co, O, and
C (Figure 4a), demonstrating
the successful doping of Cu in Co3O4, and no
other peaks of elements could be found in the survey. The Co 2p3/2 peak of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 composite reveals two characteristic
peaks at 779.2 and 780.1 eV (Figure 4b), corresponding to Co(III) and Co(II) species, respectively.22Figure 4c shows the Cu 2p XPS spectrum, which exhibits two major peaks
at 934.5 and 954.6 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, and a small satellite peak between them, indicating
the existence of copper in the oxidation state of Cu(II) in CuxCo3–xO4.33 The peaks of O 1s present three
characteristic locations at 529.3, 531.0, and 531.9 eV (Figure 4d).34 All these results indicate the successful synthesis of copper cobalt
oxides. The deconvolution of C 1s peak (Figure S7) indicates that carbon exists mainly in the form of graphitized
carbon, which is dominant on the surface of CuxCo3–xO4/C.

2.2 Electrochemical Performances of CuxCo3–xO4/C Nanocomposites
To explore the benefits of rational
design for the porous rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C composites as electrode
materials of LIBs, the electrochemical behavior of CuxCo3–xO4/C as the anode was explored by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique.
The CV curves for the first four cycles of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3
electrode at the scan rate of 0.5 mV s–1 are shown
in Figure 5a. Two obvious
peaks can be found in the first cathodic cycle at 0.95 and 0.6 V.
The intense peak located at around 0.95 V can be attributed to the
decomposition of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 and the formation of Cu and Co
nanoparticles in an amorphous matrix Li2O, as reported
in earlier studies.20 As stated in eq 1, during the initial discharge
cycle, the irreversible structure destruction process of CuxCo3–xO4 consumes 8 mol of Li per mole of CuxCo3–xO4, and thus,
electrochemically active Co and Cu nanoparticles are formed in the
matrix of Li2O. The relatively weak peak located at around
0.6 V in the first cathodic scan and then disappearing in the subsequent
cycles is due to the formation of the solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) at the interface of the electrolyte and electrode surface.35 In the first anodic process, the broad oxidation
peak located at around 2.1 V can be assigned to the oxidation of Cu
and Co to their corresponding metal oxides, as seen in eqs 2–4.19 During the next cycling process, it
is observed that the reduction peaks are found to be shifted to a
higher potential of around 1.10 V with respect to the first cycle
(0.95 V), indicating a different reaction mechanism with Li compared
to the first discharge reaction. Meanwhile, there is a slight potential
shift in the oxidation peaks in the second cycle, which can be attributed
to the reorganization of the active materials.36 After the second cycle, the intensity of the redox peaks
changes slightly, indicating good cycling stability and high reversibility
of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 electrode.

ω–0.5 plots in the low-frequency range.

Figure 5b shows
the galvanostatic charge–discharge lines of electrode at a
current density of 100 mA g–1 in a voltage window
of 0.01–3.0 V. A large voltage plateau located at ∼1.2
V followed by a sloping profile is observed in the first discharge
curve. The plateau can be attributed to the reduction of CuxCo3–xO4 to metal Co and Cu and the formation of Li2O at
the same time. The slopping part is generally regarded as capacitive
behavior of surface storage of lithium. The phenomenon has been widely
observed in mesoporous materials with high BET surface area and some
other nanostructured materials.37 The first
charge process presents a smoothly varying profile followed by a plateau
at around 2.1 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of Cu and Co
to corresponding metal oxides. These results are well consistent with
the CV measurements. According to previous studies, the lithium storage
mechanism of the CuxCo3–xO4/C could be considered as follows 1   2   3   4   5  

As shown in Figure 5b, the first discharge and charge capacities
are 974.1 mA h g–1 and 616.9 mA h g–1, respectively,
corresponding to a Coulombic efficiency of 63.3%. The irreversible
capacity loss can be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte
interface (SEI) layer, decomposition of electrolyte, and some unresolved
Li2O phases, which agree with most anode materials.38 It is notable that the Coulombic efficiency
increases gradually and maintains at above 96% after the first four
cycles. For the 10th and 50th cycles, the curves demonstrate a high
Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, indicating the increasing reversibility
and good cycling stability.

The rate capability of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 electrode was
measured with different current densities after 50 cycles. As shown
in Figure 5c, the electrode
exhibits a good rate capability with the average discharge capacities
of 885, 800, 620, and 507 mA h g–1 at current densities
of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g–1, respectively.
It is noteworthy that a high capacity of 866 mA h g–1 can be recovered when the specific current returns back to 100 mA
g–1 after dozens of heavy-duty cycles, which still
closes to the initial capacity at 100 mA g–1. This
result shows that CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 has a great potential as high-rate
anode materials for LIBs. Cycling stability is another important factor
in LIB applications. Figure 5d shows the cycling performance of the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3
electrode at a current density of 100 mA g–1. Interestingly,
the capacity of the electrodes decreases from the first discharge
of 974.1 mA h g–1 to less than 600 mA h g–1 during the first few cycles, then increases gradually with cycling,
and finally maintains stability at a certain value. There is a common
phenomenon in other transition metal oxide electrodes, which is rationally
attributed to the reversible formation of polymeric/gel-like films
originating from kinetic activation in the electrode.39 The porous structures and conductive carbon shell are other
important factors for the increasing capacities since the electrolyte
gradually penetrates into the inner part of the porous CuxCo3–xO4/C rods, thus leading to a slow electrochemical activation and reversible
reactions of active materials.22 Another
suggestion is that the formed metal nanoparticles during the discharge
processes can promote the reversible transformation of some SEI components.
Also, it allows more accessible active sites available for Li+ insertion, thus leading to an increase of capacity.33 Over the prolonged cycling, the CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 electrode shows outstanding capacity retention, and the reversible
discharge capacity remains as high as 900 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles, indicating a high capacity retention of 92.4%
with respect to the initial discharge capacity of 974.1 mA h g–1. In addition, the Columbic efficiency increases gradually
and stabilizes at above 96% even at 100% after the first four cycles,
indicating good cycling stability. For comparison, the cycling performance
of other CuxCo3–xO4/C-n electrodes at a current
density of 100 mA g–1 was also investigated. Owing
to the synergetic effect of two types of metal elements, compared
to the corresponding monometal oxides, the introduction of copper
is an important factor for enhanced LIB performance. The conductivity
of Cu is better than that of Co, while the theoretical specific capacity
of CuO (670 mA h g–1) is much lower than that of
Co3O4 (around 1000 mA h g–1). So, with the increase of Cu in CuxCo3–xO4/C-n, the conductivity will be enhanced, but the capacity may decrease.
As shown in Figure S8, CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.1
shows a high initial capacity (1115.2 mA h g–1)
but decays quickly with cycling. For CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.8, the
capacity drops from the first discharge capacities of 836.7 mA h g–1 to less than 300 mA h g–1 after
100 cycles, which is much lower than that of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3.
The bad cycling performance may also be attributed to the destruction
of the rod-like structure, as revealed in Figure S6. Combining both capacity advantage and morphological integrity,
CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 presents the best cycling performance.

2.3 Possible Reasons for High Performance
Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to explain
the superior electrochemical performance of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3.
The Nyquist plot is shown in Figure 5d. Obviously, a semicircle in the high-frequency region
is closely related to the charge transfer resistance of the electrode/electrolyte
interface. Meanwhile, an inclined line in the low-frequency region
is associated with the lithium-ion diffusion process.40 The intersection point of axis in the high-frequency region
is correlated with electrolyte resistance. The classic equivalent
circuit model of the investigated system is depicted in the inset
of Figure 5d to represent
the internal resistance of the battery. Re stands for the internal resistance of the battery; Rsl represents the resistance of migration, and Csl represents the capacity of the layer in the
high-frequency semicircle; Cdl and Rct are related with the double-layer capacitance
and charge transfer resistance, respectively; Zw stands for the diffusion-controlled Warburg impedance. The
Zsimp Win computer program was used to calculate the main electrical
parameters in the equivalent circuit. The Rct value of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 electrode is 9.5 Ω, which
is much smaller than that of the reported pristine CuCo2O4 electrode (≈31 Ω),22 suggesting that the carbon coating on CuxCo3–xO4 nanoparticles
derived from carbonization of organic ligands significantly lowers
contact and charge transfer impedances.

Additionally, the Li-ion
diffusion coefficients of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 were determined with the low-frequency
Warburg contribution of the impedance. The diffusion coefficient of
Li ions (DLi+) can be calculated using
the following equations41 6   7  

As shown in Figure 5f, Z′
corresponds to the real impedance,
ω(2πf) represents the angular frequency
in the low-frequency region; meanwhile, Re + Rct and the Warburg coefficient (σ)
can be calculated from the fitting line, and Z′
has a linear relationship with ω–0.5. In eq 7, T, R, A, and F represents
the absolute temperature, gas constant, surface area of the electrode,
and Faraday’s constant, respectively. CLi represents the molar concentration of Li ions. n is the number of electrons transfer per mole of the active material
involved in the electrode reaction. According to the fitting linear
equation in Figure 5f, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients of CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3
is calculated to be approximately 3.17 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, which is much better than
another reported CuCo2O4/carbon composite (2.23
× 10–13 cm2 s–1).22 These results further confirm that
both the charge transfer and Li-ion diffusion kinetics of the porous
rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C are improved significantly, thus leading to
superior electrochemical properties.

The high reversible capacity,
superior rate performance, and excellent
cycling stability of the porous rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 electrode
may be attributed to several factors. First, the CuxCo3–xO4 particles
are derived from Cu-Co-BTC precursors, accompanying with the carbonization
of organic ligands to form graphitized carbon covered on the bimetal
oxide particles. There is a strong and well-established interfacial
connection with carbon, thus ensuring a high conductivity required.
Second, the contact area between the active material and electrolyte
could be enlarged for the mesoporous structure. Compared with the
spherical morphology for CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.1, the unique rod-like porous structure
for CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 can offer direct channels for efficient
electron transport. However, 1D nanostructures still suffer from interfacial
kinetic problems in contact areas. Once the 1D nanostructure combines
with carbon, it can effectively solve interfacial kinetic problems.
Particularly, the pores in the 1D rods allow a high utilization efficiency
of active sites. Third, the typical one-dimensional structure and
existence of carbon materials would mitigate the volume expansion,
protect the active materials against pulverization during the charge/discharge
process, and thus improve the stability of the electrode. The comparison
of the electrochemical performance of the obtained CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 with earlier reports of other bimetal oxide for lithium-ion
batteries is summarized in Table S1. Results
confirm that the porous rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C composite electrode
with large reversible capacity and good cycling ability may accelerate
the development of high-performance LIBs. Thus, the present research
work demonstrated the important basis and wide applications in various
self-assembled nanocomposites and functionalized nanostructures.42−57

3 Conclusions
In summary, the porous
rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C composite
materials with diverse Cu/Co ratios have been synthesized with a solvothermal
method to fabricate bimetal–organic frameworks followed by
a morphology-inherited annealing treatment. The synthesized CuxCo3–xO4 nanoparticles were encapsulated in carbon coating, which
may restrain the volume expansion and improve the electronic conductivity
of electrode materials. The MOF-derived 1D porous structure provides
the efficiently accessible lithium storage active sites for high capacity
and the enhanced pathway for ion diffusion in the charge–discharge
process. Combining the advantages of the well-designed structure and
incorporation of carbon, the obtained CuxCo3–xO4/C-0.3 presents
superior electrochemical performance, including high reversible capacity
of 900 mA h g–1 even after 100 cycles and excellent
cycling stability and rate capability. It is believed that the facile
preparation process and high electrochemical performance of the porous
rod-like CuxCo3–xO4/C composite would pave the way for its practical
LIB application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Cu-Co-BTC MOFs
In a
typical synthesis, 1 g of Cu(NO)3·6H2O
and Co(NO)3·6H2O with different Cu/Co ratios,
1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and 0.1 g of trimesic acid (H3BTC) were dissolved in 30 mL of DMF solution. After magnetically
stirring for 5 min, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. The obtained
precipitate was washed several times with ethanol and deionized water
and then dried at 70 °C for 12 h in vacuum. The final obtained
powers are named Cu-Co-BTC-n (n represents
the molar ratio of Cu to Co).

4.2 Preparation
of CuxCo3–xO4/C Rods
The obtained Cu-Co-BTC-n powder was annealed in
a nitrogen atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of
5 °C min–1. The powder samples were collected
after cooling down to room temperature and named as CuxCo3–xO4-n (n = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.8).

4.3 Characterization
The structure, morphology,
and composition of samples were characterized with X-ray diffraction
spectroscopy (XRD, Rigaku 2550), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS, Escalab 250Xi), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss
Sigma HD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F), high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) imaging, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by a STA449C thermal
analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under Ar.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
The
active materials, carbon black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) with
a weight ratio of 80:10:10 were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP) solution to prepare the working electrode. The obtained slurry
was coated onto the copper foil current collector and dried in vacuum
at 70 °C for the whole night. The coin cells were assembled in
a glove box filled with argon. The pure lithium foil, a Celgard 2400
membrane, and 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of dimethyl carbonate
(DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1 in volume) were used as the
counter electrode, separator, and the electrolyte, respectively. Before
electrochemical measurement, the cells were placed for 8 h. The electrochemical
measurements were carried out in a CT-3008 battery testing system
at room temperature. An electrochemical workstation (CHI660e) was
used to test the cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV
s–1 and a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were implemented at 5 mV
amplitude ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.
