Due to the growing population, drought, and the contamination of conventional
water sources, the need for clean water is rising worldwide with high
demand. The application of nanomaterials for water purification can
provide a better water quality, by eliminating toxic metals and also
decomposing organic contaminants. Exploitation of industrial
coal-burned byproduct, fly ash, through nanomodification has been
developed in this exertion for the treatment of wastewater along with
heavy-metal remediation and dye degradation. The fly ash was sintered
at 1000 °C with addition of hydrothermally synthesized iron oxide
nanoparticles to make a cementitious composite (FA10C) using an alkali
activator (NaOH + Na2SiO3) at ambient temperature.
Chemical investigations of the fly ash and the FA10C composites were
done by X-ray fluorescence techniques. Analysis of FA10C by X-ray
diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, field emission scanning electron
microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry, and dynamic thermal analysis/thermogravimetric
techniques revealed that nanodimensioned rod-shaped mullite formation
and its interlocking textures enhance the strength of the building
composite. Furthermore, the cementitious composite (FA10C) has been
used as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals (lead, chromium, cadmium,
copper) and carcinogenic dyes (methylene blue, Congo red, and acid
red-1) from their aqueous solutions. The mineralogical features of
the composite FA10C and its adsorption capacities/efficiencies were
studied by systematic investigation of different parameters, and the
adsorption data have been analyzed using Langmuir isotherm. The experimental
findings suggest that the iron oxide nanoparticles facilitated fly
ash can be implemented as a substitute cementitious composite (greenhouse
effect) in construction technology being an energy-saving, low cost,
and eco-friendly process in adsorbent manufacturing.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The waste product of coal
combustion in thermal power plant as
fly ash is a thoughtful alarming concern for the ecological purpose
due to its lower utilization ratio in respect to its higher production
about 750 Mt global annual production.1,2 The fly ash
has been used in various fields, including soil amendments, zeolite
synthesis, filling in road works, and lands, whereas the applications
of fly ash as a key material of geopolymer concrete (cement, brick
production) has been only about 20% in recent times.3−6 The consumption of fly ash was 60% in the United States and other
countries; however, its aspect in civil engineering field is limited
because of lower reactivity and inadequate strength gain, particularly
when produced at room temperature.7−9 Diverse studies were
conducted on temperature-dependent efficacy for the proper activation
of fly ash with suitable binders for enhancing the mechanical strength
and durability of concrete structure.10,11 Considering
the huge amounts of fly ash generated, advancement of research is
required to develop new environmentally benign applications to minimize
the gap between generation and utilization.

On the other hand,
environmental compliance requirements become
gradually difficult to attain in both wastewater discharge and chemical
handling. The rapid growth of an industrial society leads to a substantial
upsurge in the demand for pure water. Industrial wastewater has a
tremendously negative impact on the environment, i.e., it can cause
soil contamination, and especially wastewater containing heavy metals
results in severe environmental loss.12,13 Electroplating,
battery, printed circuit board, and metal surface coating treatment
are the principal sources of heavy-metal contamination, which affect
the nature of the water, inhibiting sunlight penetration into the
stream and reducing the photosynthetic reaction, sometimes becoming
toxic and even carcinogenic.14−17 The conventional methods for treating dye and heavy-metal
adulterations are based on chemical coagulation and flocculation,
reverse osmosis, activated carbon adsorption, ion exchange, solvent
extraction, and adsorption; however, these technologies do not show
significant effectiveness with economic advantages.18−21 Thus, utilization of industrial
solid wastes for the treatment of wastewater could be helpful to not
only the environment, in solving the solid waste disposal problem,
but also the economy.

In this present work, the synthesized
iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles (NPs) were
characterized by ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) techniques and mixed with fly ash in a certain
amount, which was further calcined at 1000 °C. The sintered particles
were added with sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solution to synthesize
an alternative cementitious composite (FA10C) in ambient temperature.
The characterization of FA10C was also evaluated by XRD, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and EDS techniques. Differential thermal analysis along the thermogravimetric
activity of the unsintered mixtures has been investigated. The effects
of FA10C on mechanical strength (compressive and split tensile) have
been measured and further used for the dye degradation and heavy-metal
removal from the contaminated water at different varying parameters
by calculating the adsorption/degradation capacities.

2 Materials and Experimental Methods
2.1 Ingredients
Low-calcium class F dry
fly ash and locally available sand (specific gravity, 2.52; water
absorption, 0.50%; and fineness modulus, 2.38) were employed as the
key ingredients for this study. Analytical-grade sodium hydroxide
was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Commercial sodium silicate (specific
gravity, 1.53 g/cc) was obtained from SRL Co. Ltd., India. Analytical-grade
heavy-metal compounds (lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), MW = 331.21 g; cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2), MW = 236.42 g; chromium(III) nitrate (Cr(NO3)3), MW = 238.01 g; copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2),
MW = 187.56 g) were acquired from Merck, Germany.

2.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Iron Oxide
Nanoparticles
Ferric chloride (FeCl3, 1 M) and
urea (CH4N2O, 1 M) solutions were mixed gently
under continuous stirring, and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)
solution was added dropwise until the pH was adjusted at 10.0. After
that, the mixture was kept in a hydrothermal cell (Teflon-lined autoclave)
and placed in an oven for 6 h at 100 °C. The remaining solution
was washed several times with acetone and kept for drying at room
temperature. The synthesized/as-grown iron oxide product was dispersed
in deionized water, and optical characterizations with band gap were
executed by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3101PC, Shimadzu).
The crystallization-phase analysis was executed by a powder X-ray
diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Inc., Model D8, WI). A field emission
scanning electron microscope (Inspect F50 SEM, FEI Europe BV, The
Netherlands) was used to characterize the morphological properties,
and element composition of the synthesized materials was identified
by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) system coupled to the
FESEM.

2.3 Preparation of the Cementitious Composite
The fly ash (FA) was mixed with 5% iron oxide (Fe2O3) NPs by a ball-mixing machine for 2 h. The mixture (containing
fly ash and Fe2O3) was then sintered at 1000
°C for 2 h and cooled at room temperature (FA10). The mortar
sample was prepared by mixing the FA10, river sand, and binder. The
FA10 to binder ratio was affixed at 0.48, and weight ratio of FA10
to sand was maintained at 1:3. The binder was prepared by using 10
M NaOH and Na2SiO3 solution at 1:2 gyrometric
ratio. After thorough mixing, the mixture was poured into 20 mm ×
20 mm × 20 mm cubes to prepare the cementitious composite (FA10C).
After 48 h, the samples were removed and kept at room temperature
for curing.

2.4 Characterization of the
Cementitious Composite
The synthesized composite FA10C was
crushed to a powder, sieved
through a 50 μm sieve, and prepared for several characterization
techniques. The chemical compositions of FA10C and fly ash were determined
by X-ray fluorescence (AXIOSmAX, PANanalytical, the Netherlands).
The mineralogical composition of FA10C was assessed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD; D8-Focus-type X-ray diffractometer). The scanning range was
10–80° 2θ at a scan speed of 0.5 s/step using Cu
Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA), and phases were identified by
JCPDS files. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of FA10C were
obtained using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific America)
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1. A field emission
scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer
(QUANTAX ESPRIT 1.9 software) was used to investigate the morphological
behavior and elemental analysis, respectively. The specific surface
area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area analyzer (SA 3100, Beckman Coulter, Switzerland). The
thermal reaction processes were measured using a dynamic thermal/thermogravimetric
analyzer (DTG-60H, Shimadzu) for the mixture of fly ash and 5% Fe2O3 NPs sample in a N2 gas atmosphere.

2.5 Strength Analysis
The mortar samples
of cubical dimension (50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm) and cylindrical
dimension (100 mm diameter × 50 mm height) were tested for compressive
strength and split tensile strength, respectively. The testing was
performed at the age of 28 days and the results were compared to those
of the conventional control mortar samples. The conventional control
samples were made using ordinary portland cement, sand, and water. The ratios of cement to sand and cement to water were fixed at 1:3
and 1:0.4, respectively.

2.6 Effect on Heavy Metals
(Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and Cu2+)
2.6.1 Adsorption and Desorption of Heavy Metals
(Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and Cu2+)
Initially, 1 g of dried FA10C was added to 25 mL of heavy-metal
solution (1 M at pH 4.0) and continuously stirred at 200 rpm and 25
°C for 360 min using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
(ICP-MS), the adsorptions of metal ions were calculated by the following
equation 1  where “qe” is the amount of metals adsorbed at equilibrium
(mg/g),
“C0” and “Ce” are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of metals (mg/L), m is the mass of FA10C (g), and V is the volume of the solution (L). The different carcinogenic
heavy-metal (Pb2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, and
Cd2+) solutions were made by dissolving their respective
compounds Pb(NO3)2, Cd(NO3)2, Cr(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2 in
distilled water distinctly. To study the effect of the pH of initial
solution, the different pH values (2.0–7.0) were adjusted with
diluted nitric acid (HNO3) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
The same mixing techniques were implemented at initial fixed pH (4.0)
but varying shaking time (10–360 min) to see the influence
of contact time on the adsorption of metals. To investigate the effect
of temperature on the adsorption, a similar experiment was carried
out at different temperatures (15, 25, 30, 35, and 45 °C), but
the concentration of each heavy-metal solution was fixed at about
1 M at pH 4.0. The adsorption study was conducted after 360 min of
contact time.

Desorption tests were also done on FA10C obtained
from the previously described adsorption test. Two types of experiments
were conducted to study the leaching characteristics of the metal
ions in lead-containing specimens: (a) water treatment and (b) acid
treatment. The contact time for each type was affixed at 3 h at 25
°C. The leaching efficiency (εL) of metals (Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and Cu2+)
was determined according to the following equation 2  where “Ce” is the residual concentration (ppm) and “C0” is the initial concentration of the
heavy-metal (Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and
Cu2+) ions (ppm).

2.7 Dye Degradation
Study
Methylene blue
(MB), Congo red (CR), and acid red 1 (AR) dyes were employed for this
experiment. Each dye solution of varying concentration was mixed with
the FA10C samples under a UV lamp (KODAK, 40 W) under constant stirring
at 25 °C. Absorbance spectra of the reaction mixtures were recorded
at 663, 500, and 532 nm wavelengths for MB, CR, and AR after every
15 min time interval up to 3 h, respectively. The degradation efficiency
was calculated using the formula 3  where “A0” is the original absorbance of the
solution before irradiation
and “At”
is the absorbance of the solution at t time after
irradiation. To investigate the effect of pH on adsorption, a series
of each dye solution was prepared by adjusting pH (2–10) and
optical density was measured after 180 min. An experiment was conducted
for the various dosages of FA10C on dye degradation, varying the dosage
from 0.1 to 2 g/L and keeping the initial concentration of each dye
at 10 mg/L at constant pH 7.0.

2.8 Adsorption
Isotherm
The equilibrium
adsorption isotherm has an importance in the design of adsorption
systems, which is conducted by the Langmuir isotherm in the present
study. A Langmuir isotherm model is hired to evaluate the investigational
data and to acquire the isothermal adsorption graphs and related parameters.
The Langmuir isotherm model assumes that adsorption takes place at
specific homogeneous surface within the adsorbent; there are no interactions
between adsorbates, and the surface has equal affinity and energy.22,23 The Langmuir isotherm can be written in the form 3.1   3.2  where “qe” is the absorbed amount (mg/g); “Ce” is the equilibrium concentration (mg/L); “qm” is the absorption capacity (mg/g);
and “KL” is the Langmuir
binding constant.

2.9 Statistical Analysis
For testing
compressive and split tensile strengths, five samples of each category
were tested and the experiment was repeated at least three times.
Data were presented as average (over 12 samples) and ±SD (standard
deviation).

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 Characterization of the Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
The
formation of iron oxide particles can be described through
the following probable chemical reactions. NH4OH is responsible
for the generation of hydroxyl ions (OH−) as well as controls
the pH of the solution during the reaction process. FeOOH is formed
by the reaction of FeCl3 with NH4OH. On heating,
FeOOH further produces Fe2+ and OH– ions, which
consequently assist in the development of Fe2O3 ions.    The concentration
of synthesized Fe2O3 increased with reaction
time, which escorts the shape
of desired nanodimensioned particles. Figure 1A exhibits the absorption spectrum of the
as-prepared iron oxide NPs solution. The onset of absorption maxima
at 585 nm wavelength in the visible range was shown, indicating the
formation of low-dimensioned reddish Fe2O3 particles.
In the UV/visible absorption progression, the outermost electrons
absorb radiant energy and transit to high energy levels in any molecule/atom.
In this procedure, the spectrum obtained owing to optical absorption
can be analyzed to acquire the energy band gap of nanomaterial. The
band gap of the as-prepared nanoparticles is determined by the relation 4  where “c” is
a constant, “Eg” is the
band gap of the material, and “α” is the absorption
coefficient. Figure 1B represents the plot of (αhυ)2 versus energy (hυ) to determine the band
gap and it is found to be 2.86 eV for the synthesized nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Characterization
of iron oxide NPs by (A) UV–vis spectroscopy,
(B) binding energy, (C) XRD, (D) FESEM, and (E) EDS.

XRD is a nondestructive method, which gives a clear
idea about
the nature of the composite material. It can give information about
whether the material has crystalline or amorphous nature. Figure 1C depicts the typical
crystallinity of the synthesized iron oxide NPs, where the reflection
peaks matched with those of the Fe2O3 phase
(JCPDS File no. 24-0072). Major characteristic peaks for the as-grown
metallic iron oxide at 2θ values of 24.1°(012), 33.1°(104),
35.6°(110), 39.2°(006), 40.8°(113), 49.4°(024),
54.1°(116), 62.3°(214), and 63.9°(300) indicate that
the nanoparticles are well crystalline. Figure 1D exhibits the morphology of the as-synthesized
iron oxide NPs in an almost uniform spherical shape of nanodiameter.

The electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the particles specifies the presence of “Fe”
and “O” elements in the pure as-grown iron oxide (Fe2O3) NPs. It is clearly shown that the
materials are limited only iron and oxygen elements, in atomic percentages
of 38.65 and 61.35%, respectively (Figure 1E).

3.2 Characterization of Composite
Material
The chemical compositions of FA and FA10C obtained
by XRF technique
are represented in Table 1. It is shown that fly ash is mainly made of 64.48% SiO2, 28.82% Al2O3, 2.57% Fe2O3, and little amount of oxides (CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, etc.). After geopolymerization, the content of
sodium and the loss on ignition (L.O.I.) increased considerably as
this process helps to incorporate sodium and hydroxyl group within
the structure of geopolymer.24 The reduction
of Al2O3 is observed in the FA10C sample compared
to fly ash. The weight percentages of SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 are about 56.45, 17.12,
and 9.85 in FA10C, respectively. Calcium has an advance effect during
the conversion of fly ash to geopolymer as the calcium provides additional
nucleation sites for precipitation of dissolved species in the geopolymerization
process.25 However, when the CaO content
is high, the microstructural porosity decreases and the resulting
formation of amorphous structure Ca–Al–Si gel strengthens
the final product.26,27 The percentage increment of the
Fe2O3 is observed from 2.57 to 9.85 as it was
added externally before the calcination process.

Table 1 Chemical Composition

The composition of
the prepared FA10C was characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) study (Figure 2A). Several peaks at different positions in the XRD
spectra confirm the presence of mullite. The diffraction peaks at
2θ values of 16.43, 25.97, 26.26, 30.96, 33.22, 35.27, 40.87,
42.59, 57.56, and 60.71° represent the mullite structure with
indices (110), (120), (210), (001), (220), (111), (121), (230), (041),
and (331) and the peaks at 24.12, 35.61, and 49.41° represent
the Fe2O3 NP structures with (012), (110), and
(024) indices, respectively. The spectra are in close agreement with
JCPDS card Nos. 15-0776 and 24-0072 for mullite and Fe2O3, respectively. The presence of silica (quartz) is confirmed
by the detection of peaks at 2θ values of 20.85° (100),
36.54° (110), and 75.67° (302) and matched with JCPDS file
No. 331161.

Figure 2 (A) XRD and (B) FTIR spectra of the FA10C sample.

In the FTIR spectra of FA10C (Figure 2A), the bands around 460 cm–1 are identified due to in-plane Si–O bending
and Al–O
links; however, a minor peak at 822 cm–1 is assigned
to stretching modes of T–O (T: Si or Al) and corresponds to
dissolve silicate/aluminosilicate species.28,29 The band at around 587 cm–1 is due to the existence
of Fe2O3 in the FA10C sample.30 The broad band (1622 cm–1) is attributed
to bending vibrations (H–O–H), and it is typical for
polymeric configurations with aluminosilicate complex. The asymmetric
and symmetric stretching vibrations ν (O–H) at 3433 cm–1 suggest the presence of an amorphous silicate material
or possibly hydrated aluminum silicates. Another broad band at 1069
cm–1 is seen in this spectrum due to Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching vibrations of silica.31 The bands associated with mullite appear at around 560, 730, 822,
and 1170 cm–1,32 which
correspond to alumina octahedra (AlO6), alumina tetrahedra
(AlO4), Al–O vibrational modes of δ-alumina,
and silica tetrahedra (SiO4), respectively.33

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
of the FA10C exhibits
irregular rod-shaped mullite phases, along with spherical-shaped Fe2O3 NPs in Figure 3A. For a more detailed understanding of the individual
component percentages in the composition of the FA10C, an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis was conducted, which indicates
that the percents of aluminum, silicon, iron, and oxygen elements
were 17.23, 28.3, 8.04, and 35.01%, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3B. The surface characteristics
of the FA10C samples were subsequently examined via BET. The surface
area of the FA10C sample is about 60.75 m2/g, and the composite
was mesoporous (∼72%) in nature. The FA10C composite was used
for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation due to its higher surface
area.

Figure 3 FESEM and EDS images of FA10C.

Dynamic thermal analysis (DTA) of the FA (fly ash + Fe2O3) samples (Figure 4) shows a slow endothermic fall within the temperature
range. This fall was attributable to the evaporation of volatile components,
such as water, isopropyl alcohol, nitrogen dioxide, etc. As the fly
ash is already a burned material, no such detectable change was observed
in DTA. In Figure 4, the exothermic peak at high temperature was seen, which shows the
probable evidence of mullitization. No change in weight
loss is seen in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) graph at higher temperature.

curves of FA10.

3.3 Activity
of FA10C as a Building Materials
The mechanical strengths
(compressive, split tensile) of the FA10C
mortar samples were represented in tabular form (Table 2). The result shows that the
maximum compressive and flexural strengths were obtained in the case
of FA10C at 28 days compared to conventional mortar samples. The rod-shaped
hard mullite was prepared in nanosize, which creates an interlocking
textures in the FA10C matrices, which may be the key reason to increase
the strengths of the composite.

Table 2 Strength
Measurement (in MPa)
sample	compressive	% increment	split tensile	% increment	
control	25.63 ± 1.94	 	2.46 ± 0.18	 	
FA10C	34.88 ± 2.33	36.08	3.39 ± 0.40	38.27	
3.4 Heavy-Metal Adsorption
The effect
of pH, temperature, contact time, and initial concentration on the
adsorption capacity of heavy-metal ions is shown in Figure 5. The adsorption of heavy-metal
ions increases with increasing pH and molar concentrations of the
initial solution (Figure 5A). At higher pHs, the H+ ion concentration is
also sufficient in solution and adsorption capacity becomes higher
as the adsorbent always has greater tendency to adsorb H+ ions. At higher molar concentration of the solution, the adsorption
capacity of FA10C for every metal sufficiently increased and reached
the saturation level above 6 M concentration (Figure 5D). At lower pH, the samples have poor adsorption
capacities due to more H3O+ availability in
the solution as the adsorption capacities for metal ions are dropped
by the competition with H3O+.

Figure 5 Effects of (A) pH, (B)
temperature, (C) time, and (D) initial concentration
on adsorption performance.

The adsorption capacities of FA10C for each metal ion at
pH 5 are
significantly higher and saturated at pH ≥ 6, which is correlated
to other studies.34,35 The adsorption capacity for Pb2+ is the highest (81.2 mg/g at pH 5) as FA10C has additional
adsorption sites for Pb2+ than others, whereas the lowest
adsorption capacity was found for Cr3+ (24.6 mg/g at pH
5), which may be due to the presence of numerous unlike ions in its
respective pH atmosphere. Figure 5B illustrates the effect of temperature on adsorption
percentage. It can be noticed that the adsorption of each heavy-metal
ion on FA10C increases with increasing temperature. The diffusion
of the heavy-metals ions on the FA10C surface results in adsorption
by ion-exchange phenomenon at higher temperature.36,37 Additionally, microcavities can be formed inside the composite by
water vaporization at higher temperature, which may increase the adsorption
capacity. The kinetic adsorption experiment is revealed in Figure 5C to calculate the
equilibrium time dependence behavior of adsorption. The result demonstrates
that the adsorption increased with increasing contact/shaking time,
reached the maximum after 120 min, and became almost saturated after
that. The nanodimensioned mullite is formed in FA10C during calcination
at 1000 °C, resulting in the increase of the specific contact
surface area of the composite and thus further leading to more adsorption
sites with higher adsorption capacity. After the geopolymerization
process, the matrix of FA10C may be introduced by nanosized pore structures,
which leads to more efficacy for heavy-metal adsorption.

3.5 Heavy-Metal Desorption
Figure 6 illustrates the effect of
water and acid treatment on the leaching efficiency at 24 and 48 h.
The amount of metals extracted from the solution increased in conjunction
with the experimental duration. The 24 h water treatment cannot remove
Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu3+ ions from the
sample, where insignificant recovery rates up to 0.8, 0.3, and 0.2
were obtained, respectively. The desorption results indicate that
the amount of heavy metals (Pb2+, Cd2+, and
Cu3+) leached in the solution was smaller at water treatment
for 24 h. The extraction is strongly enhanced when acidic conditions
are employed.

Figure 6 Effect of water and acid treatment on heavy-metal extraction
at
24 and 48 h.

The recovery of lead,
copper, and cadmium at larger quantities
was found, which can be recognized to an ion exchange between H+ and metallic cations or to dissolution of precipitated metals.
The elements belonging to higher atomic number generally have lower
free energy of hydration. The H+ ion can exchange the site
of adsorbed metallic ions easily as it has the highest free energy
of hydration. The amount of Cr3+ ions extracted was found
to be the highest among the applied heavy metals. Having a 3+ charge, the net charge of chromium was not balanced after an ion
exchange with Na+, resulting in an imbalance that destabilized
the adsorption status, which assists in the detachment of Cr3+ from the sample and its redissolvement into the solution. In addition,
as the higher charged ions can perform ion exchange more easily, the
Cr3+ leaching is the highest in amount to the solution.

3.6 Dye Degradation Analysis
The pH of
the dye solution plays a pivotal role in the adsorption process. The
variation of methylene blue, Congo red, and acid red 1 adsorption
on FA10C over a broad range of pH is shown in Figure 7A. Experimental results show that, for the
CR solution with lower pH (4.0), improved effectiveness of reduction
and considerable efficiencies in higher pH (>7) were observed.
Better
efficiencies for the AR solution were shown at pH 3.0, and higher
MB adsorption is found at pH 5.0. The adsorption of the dyes onto
the adsorbent surface is mainly influenced by the superficial charge
on the adsorbent as well as by the pH. The basic dyes produce cations
(C+) and reduced ions (CH+) in water. The tendency
for adsorption of the dyes (cations) is influenced by the increment
of the negative charge density on the FA10C surface at the pH value
near or above the zero point of the charge.38 In addition, by the protonation, in the acidic medium, the positive
charge density can be found more on the dye molecules at lower pH,
resulting in the lower enchanting.39 Adsorption
of the organic substrate is generally considered to be an important
parameter in determining photocatalytic degradation rates.40Figure 7B shows that the amount of each dye adsorbed on the photocatalyst
from aqueous solution increases quickly with time and equilibrium
is established within 30 min. Therefore, when the adsorption reaches
equilibrium, the amount of dyes adsorbed by FA10C is largest, which
may be attributed to the synergistic effect of FA10C. The variation
of dye degradation exhibits that the minimum 1.0 g/L dosage was considerable
and sufficient for maximum dye degradation (Figure 7C). At lower concentrations, the dye removal
efficiency was less as the required quantity of photoreactive elements
was not present; thereby, the amount of OH radicals was also less.
Hence, 1.0 g/L dosage was taken as an optimum value of FA10C and >90%
degradation was credited to photocatalytic activity.

3.7 Langmuir Isotherm
The liner fitted
curves for Langmuir isotherms and parameters depict that the isotherms
data fit splendidly and the values of R2 for the heavy metals/dyes are very close to 1 (Figure 8). The adsorption data fitted
very well in the Langmuir model, with higher correlation coefficients.
Considering the best fit with respect to the values of R2 (0.9952, 0.9890, 0.9921, and 0.9917 for Pb, Cd, Cu,
and Cr, respectively), the surface of the adsorbent is considered
to be homogeneous. Similarly, the values of R2 for MB, CR, and AR are 0.9963, 0.98787, and 0.99425, respectively,
which support the statement of homogeneous surface of adsorbent for
the monolayer of dye molecules. The monolayer adsorption is obtained
and the process becomes highly favorable, which confirms the homogenous
adsorption and negligible interaction between adsorbed molecules.

4 Conclusions
Using iron oxide nanoparticles
in fly ash has been suggested to
diminish the mullitization temperature. The mullite was synthesized
in nano form at lower temperature and turned waste materials into
usable ones for better construction purpose. Exploration of lucrative
and easy methodologies for the development of water treatment using
the most common byproducts is therefore highly important for commercial
purposes, which creates new hope for construction and water treatment
technologies. The reuse of fly ash would substantially improve the
ecological footprint in construction field as cement causes massive
CO2 emission during its production, affecting the global
climate negatively.
