Two p-type donor–acceptor
(D–A) semiconducting small
molecules were synthesized to investigate the effect of the backbone
curvature on the organic field-effect transistor performance. The
backbone curvature of the donor–acceptor small molecules was
modified by changing the spacer group from bithiophene to thienothiophene.
Bithiophene to thienothiophene spacer groups were placed between 4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole (donor) and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (acceptor) to generate TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP donor–acceptor molecules. A
good charge carrier mobility of 2.59 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 was measured
for the curved molecule (TP-BT4T-TP), while the linear
molecule analog (TP-BT2TT-TP) only gave a low mobility
of 5.41 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 after annealing at 120 °C in bottom-contact
bottom-gate devices. Out-of-plane grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction
analysis revealed more drastic thermally induced crystallinity for TP-BT4T-TP as compared to TP-BT2TT-TP, explaining
the difference observed in the performance of devices fabricated from
each molecule.

Introduction
Organic semiconductors
(OSCs) for organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs) are technologically promising because of their lightweight,
low cost, flexibility, large-area fabrication, and solution processability.1−7 The performance of OSCs used in OFETs has already surpassed the
performance of both amorphous silicon (0.1–1 cm2 V–1 s–1) and polycrystalline
silicon (0.1–1 cm2 V–1 s–1) with an on/off ratio from 106 to 108.8,9 The incorporation of acenes, such as pentacene and its derivatives,
achieved impressive charge carrier mobilities in the range of 10–40
cm2 V–1 s–1.10 The major drawback of these acenes is the instability
in air for prolonged durations and the necessity of vacuum deposition.11,12 These processing conditions and methods needed for the small molecules
OSCs significantly curtail their use in real-world applications. To
impart solution processability, solubilizing alkyl chains are employed
to generate solution-processable small molecules and polymers. Compared
to solution-processable polymers, small molecules are more attractive
candidates for OFETs, as OSCs based on small molecules possess well-defined
structures, high purity, less batch to batch variations, better crystallinity,
and higher reproducibility.13,14

Currently, OFETs
fabricated from small-molecular semiconductors
have reported charge carrier mobilities exceeding 5 cm2 V–1 s–1.15 However, multistep synthesis and low overall yields prevent
commercialization of these materials encouraging chemists to pursue
easy-to-synthesize high-performing materials with good overall yields.
To further improve the performance, it is critical to understand the
fundamental aspects of these small molecules such as planarity,16,17 heteroatom effect, and backbone curvature. Out of many variations,
the backbone curvature has not been studied extensively in OFETs as
other parameters.

Design of novel OSCs with improved performance
in devices is a
demanding challenge. Design strategies include the use of fused rings,15,18 side-chain engineering,19−21 positioning of donor and acceptor
(D–A) units,22,23 and heteroatom replacement in
the conjugated backbone.8,15 Among them, the inclusion
of fused rings in the backbone and D–A structural designs are
widely studied to tailor their optoelectronic properties. Fused rings
systems permit the formation of more rigid and planer assemblies,
forming more favorable π–π intermolecular interactions
with the deep-lying HOMO energy level through larger resonance stabilization
energy, resulting in better charge carrier transport characteristics.15,18,24 Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,25,26 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole,27,28 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran,29,30 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene30,31 are some of the fused rings extensively explored to generate OSC
constructs. Similarly, designing small molecules with D–A architecture
increases the intermolecular interactions originated from donor and
acceptor moieties, aiding in the production of high-performing OSC
devices.32,33 On the other hand, heteroatom inclusions
are not straightforward and require more research on the topic.8 Though not extensively investigated in OSCs as
thiophene, pyrrole-containing OSCs are shown to be excellent electronic
materials for organic electronic applications.34−36 High electron
density, challenging synthesis, and less air stability of the pyrrole-unit
limit their use as OSCs. Fusing thiophene with pyrrole generates a
relatively stable TP unit with strong donor character, and more importantly,
solubilizing groups can be easily added via the pyrrolic nitrogen
atom. Thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole is proven to be a potential
nonconventional building block to synthesize novel OSCs. The structural
unit is already employed to build both polymers and small-molecule
OSCs, and its performance has been investigated in both vacuum-deposited
and solution-processable OFETs.37−41 Also, many high-performance OSCs tend to present nonideal FET leading
to overestimated charge carrier mobilities while TP unit containing
molecules possess nearly ideal current–voltage characteristics,
allowing for more reliable measurement of effect charge carrier mobility
in devices.9,42

Previously, banana-shaped
D–A molecules with furan and thiophene
spacer groups with TP and BT have been investigated in OFETs by our
group.38,39 However, the change of spacer group from
thiophene to furan resulted in a more curved structure and led to
a FET inactive molecule. The cause of the FET inactivity, however,
could not be determined whether it was due to the effect of the curvature
or the heteroatom effect. To minimize ambiguity, herein, we present
two molecules (one bent and one linear) with the same number of heteroatoms
to study the effect of backbone curvature on charge carrier mobility.
The chemical structures of two semiconductors are depicted in Figure 1. The two molecules
were synthesized using 2,2′-bithiophene (BT) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), with TP as the donor and BT as the acceptor
in both molecules.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Small-Molecule Semiconductors
The synthesis
of the donor–acceptor small molecules reported here is shown
in Scheme 1. The palladium
catalyzed Stille coupling of [2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yltrimethylstannane
and trimethyl(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane
with brominated benzothiadiazole was used to synthesize thienothiophene-
and bithiophene-flanked benzothiadiazole, separately. The targeted
small-molecule TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP were synthesized by Stille coupling of ethyl 2-bromo-4-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylate with
4,7-bis(5-(trimethyl stannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 4,7-bis(5′-(trimethylstannyl)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, respectively. The synthesis of ethyl
2-bromo-4-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylate was carried out according to a literature
reported procedure.37,38 The final products were precipitated
out of solution in methanol as pure compounds without time-consuming
column purification. All of the intermediates and final molecules
were characterized with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The detailed synthetic procedures
for intermediates and final products can be found in Supporting Information.

Optical and Electrochemical
Properties
Optical properties
of the small molecules were obtained in both solution and thin film
using chloroform as the solvent. The absorption spectra of the molecules
are shown in Figure 2, and their optical and electrochemical properties are summarized
in Table 1. Both molecules
show similar absorption behavior, having two peaks. The peaks centered
at 400 nm (for TP-BT2TT-TP) and 412 nm (for TP-BT4T-TP) arise from the intramolecular π–π* transition
along the conjugated backbone. On the other hand, the peaks appearing
at 546 nm (for TP-BT2TT-TP) and 542 nm (for TP-BT2T-TP) come from the intramolecular charge transfer between delocalized
HOMO to LUMO energy levels.43 In the solid
state, both semiconductors exhibited a slight red shift (14–16
nm) in their absorption profile. Annealing of the thin film of TP-BT4T-TP at 120 °C did not result in a red shift (Figure
S5, Supporting Information). However, annealing
of the thin film of TP-BT2TT-TP gave a small red shift
of ∼18 nm for both peaks (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The onset of the thin film absorption profiles
was used to estimate the optical band gap of molecules. To calculate
the HOMO/LUMO energy level and electrochemical band gap of molecules,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used on thin films of the molecules deposited
on the carbon electrode. The onset of oxidation and reduction peaks
was used to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy respectively using following
equations: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.4) eV. The corresponding HOMO/LUMO energies
of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP are 2.99 eV/4.97
eV and 2.93 eV/4.78 eV, respectively. TP-BT4T-TP possesses
a band gap of 1.98 eV, which is slightly higher than the band gap
of TP-BT2TT-TP at 1.85 eV.

Theoretical Calculations
The frontier molecular orbital
and energy levels of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP were examined by theoretical calculations with Spartan′16
software at the B3LYP level of theory and with the 6-31G* basis set.
The dodecyl alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups for the
ease of calculations. The optimized geometries, frontier molecular
orbitals, and energies are depicted in Figure 3. TP-BT2TT-TP adopted a more
planar backbone conformation compared to TP-BT4T-TP,
with minimal dihedral angles between the TP unit and the backbone.
The electron density of the LUMO energy level of both molecules is
predominantly concentrated over the benzothiadiazole moiety; however,
the electron density of the HOMO energy level of both molecules is
distributed along the conjugated backbone. The calculated HOMO and
LUMO energy levels for both TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP are comparable with experimental obtained values.

Figure 3 DFT calculations of TP-BT4T-TP (left) and TP-BT2TT-TP (right).

Thermal Stability
Thermal properties
of semiconductors
were studied with thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). The corresponding TGA curves and DSC thermograms
are shown in Figure S1. All of the molecules
were thermally stable having decomposition temperatures (Td at 95% weight loss) more than 250 °C. The corresponding
decomposition temperatures of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP are 265 and 306 °C, respectively. Both TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP showed melting peaks in the heating
cycle at 177.6 and 262.2 °C respectively, which reflects the
crystalline nature of the molecules. However, in their cooling traces,
only TP-BT2TT-TP exhibited an intense cold crystallization
peak at 253.6 °C.

OFET Performance
A summary of OFETs
performance and
corresponding transfer curves are given in Tables S1 and S2, and Figure S2. Although there was no initial OFET activity, upon
annealing p-type FET characteristics were observed for both molecules.
For TP-BT4T-TP, hole mobility of 1.87 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 was achieved
along with an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 103 after annealing at 60 °C
for 5 min. Further increase of annealing temperature to 120 °C
improved the OFET performance to obtain maximum hole mobility to 2.59
× 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 with an Ion/Ioff ratio greater than 104. Beyond
the annealing temperature of 120 °C, a decrease in carrier mobility
was observed. This change can be attributed to the deformation of
thin films upon annealing. The maximum hole mobility of 5.41 ×
10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 was observed for TP-BT2TT-TP after annealing
devices at 120 °C. The annealing temperature did not improve
the performances of TP-BT2TT-TP significantly as in TP-BT4T-TP (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Transfer curves of (a) TP-BT4T-TP and (b) TP-BT2TT-TP and the output curves of (c) TP-BT4T-TP and (d) TP-BT2TT-TP after annealing at 120 °C. Device parameters:
channel length (L) = 20 μm; channel width (W) = 475 μm.

Grazing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction Analysis
Grazing-incidence
X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis was performed for both annealed
and non-annealed films to analyze possible thermally induced crystallinity.
The corresponding out-of-plane GIXRD patterns are shown in Figure 5. Thin films of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP were annealed at 120 °C for 5 min prior to GIXRD analysis.
Before annealing the TP-BT4T-TP film, it exhibited only
one diffraction peak at 28.5° arising because of π–π
stacking. However, upon annealing at 120 °C, an additional diffraction
peak at 2.60° was observed, and the intensity of π–π
stacking diffraction also slightly increased. Consequently, the annealing
process improved the ordering of TP-BT4T-TP films, reflected
by devices possessing enhanced charge carrier mobilities. However,
only a weak diffraction peak at 2.30° is seen in the GIXRD pattern
for both annealed and non-annealed films of TP-BT2TT-TP. This observation aligns with the poor performance of TP-BT2TT-TP in devices. The respective d-spacing values for
diffraction peaks in the pattern of both molecules are demonstrated
in Table 2. The in-plane
GIXRD showed no diffraction peaks (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

TP-BT2TT-TP	(100)	2.30	38.4	
Thin-Film Morphology
Tapping mode atomic force microscopy
(TMAFM) images were recorded for the devices in their channel regions
to probe the morphology of the thin organic films. The height and
phase images of thin films of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP are shown in Figures 5 and S4. Examining the images, the annealing
of TP-BT4T-TP thin films at 120 °C for 5 min caused
the formation of large domains compared to those present in non-annealed
thin films. This indicates that TP-BT4T-TP possesses
strong intermolecular interactions upon annealing, and this behavior
is further confirmed by enhanced lamellar packing diffraction in the
GIXRD analysis. On the other hand, the microstructure of TP-BT2TT-TP did not change with the annealing process, and it has more dense
aggregates.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel
small p-type molecules, TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP, were synthesized from thieno[2,3-b]pyrrole and
benzothiadiazole spaced by two thiophene units
and thienothiophene, respectively, to generate two backbone curvatures.
The OFET parameters of TP-BT4T-TP and TP-BT2TT-TP were evaluated with BG/BC device configuration. TP-BT4T-TP exhibited charge carrier mobility of 0.0259 cm2 V–1 s–1 upon annealing at 120 °C,
whereas the TP-BT2TT-TP molecule showed charge carrier
mobility of 5.41 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1. The drastic difference can
be rationalized by thermally enhanced crystallinity and strong intermolecular
interactions of TP-BT4T-TP as shown by GIXRD and TMAFM
analysis.

Experimental Section
General Materials and Methods
All
the chemicals were
purchased from Fisher Scientific or Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification unless otherwise mentioned. All the reactions
were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere. Ethyl 2-bromo-4-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylate,38 [2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yltrimethylstannane,44 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,45 and trimethyl(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane46 were synthesized according to previously published
procedures. All the proton and carbon NMR spectra were recorded on
a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer. The MALDI-TOF experiments were
performed with a Shimadzu Biotech AXIMA Confidence in reflectron-HiRes
mode by depositing chloroform solutions of the matrix (2,2′:5′,2″-terthiophene
as the matrix, 1.0 μL) followed by depositing the analyte (1.0
μL) dissolved in chloroform. TGA and DSC were performed with
a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC-1 system by applying a heating rate of 10
°C/min and a cooling rate of −10 °C/min under a nitrogen
flow. The UV–vis spectra were obtained from an Agilent 8453
UV–vis spectrometer. The UV–vis spectra of final molecules
in solution (chloroform) and thin films (after drop-casting on cleaned
glass substrates) were obtained with an Agilent 8453 UV–vis
spectrometer. The BAS CV-50W voltammetric analyzer was used for CV
measurements by employing three electrodes (Pt inert working electrode,
Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode)
and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate solution as the electrolyte.
GIXRD measurements of samples were carried out with a Rigaku III SmartLab
XRD instrument by spin-coating of TP-BT4T-TP (in chloroform
5 mg/mL) and drop-casting of TP-BT2TT-TP (in chloroform
1.5 mg/mL) on a cleaned octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) treated Si
substrate. TMAFM images were obtained with a Nanoscope IV Multimode
Veeco instrument by scanning inside the channel region. The size of
the scan area for recording images was 2 × 2 μm with a
frequency of 1 Hz.

Fabrication of Solution-Processed OFET Devices
The
small molecules were used to fabricate a bottom-gate/bottom-contact
(BGBC) device configuration to test the OFET performance. Highly n-doped
Si wafers with a thermally grown 200 nm SiO2 dielectric
layer were used as substrates. A 5 nm thick layer of chromium and
a 100 nm thick layer of Au were deposited on the Si/SiO2 surface using a Temescal E-beam evaporator. Source and drain contacts
(Cr/Au) with different channel lengths were patterned by photolithography.
The contacts were then covered with a photoresist, and the backside
was etched with 7:1 BOE solution. Using the Temescal E-beam evaporator,
100 nm of gold gate electrode was deposited. The devices were washed
with water, acetone, toluene, and 2-propanol. Before fabricating devices
with small molecules, the surface of each device was modified with
6 μM OTMS solution to obtain a self-assembled monolayer, carried
out via a previously published procedure.47 Small donor–acceptor molecule TP-BT4T-TP was
dissolved in chloroform (5 mg/mL) and filtered through a 0.25 μm
PTFE filter to remove any undissolved particles. The solution was
spin-coated onto the device at 500 rpm for 45 s in a nitrogen-filled
glove box.

Similarly, the small donor–acceptor molecule TP-BT2TT-TP was dissolved in chloroform (1.5 mg/mL) and filtered.
It was drop-cast onto the devices to obtain a thin layer of semiconductor.
All devices were kept in a nitrogen-filled glovebox until they were
measured with a Keithly 4200 Parameter Analyzer.
