We
present a systematic approach for predicting the best solvents
for selective extraction of components with unknown structure from
complex mixtures (e.g., natural products)—a tool promising
dramatic simplification of extraction process optimization. Its key
advantage is that identification of the component(s) is unnecessary—prediction
is based on a small set of experimental distribution coefficients
(obtained using a combination of shake-flask extraction and chromatographic
analysis) rather than structure-based descriptors. The methodology
is suitable for the very common situations in practice where the desired
compound needs to be separated from unknown impurities (i.e., selectively
extracted from the mixture), as well as for large-scale and high-throughput
work. The proof-of-concept methodology was developed and evaluated
using an extensive set of experimental distribution data of lignin-related
compounds obtained in this work.

Introduction
Liquid–liquid
extraction is a separation method widely used
both on laboratory scale and in industrial processes due to its simplicity,
low cost, suitability for thermally labile and high-boiling compounds,
and easy scalability.1,2 Properly chosen conditions and
parameters (extraction solvents and/or extractants, pH, temperature)
make it possible to concentrate the compounds of interest and separate
them from undesirable components in a single step. However, systematic
improvement of the process by predicting the effects of various parameter
modifications is a challenging task. Factorial design of experiments
is a useful, although comparatively labor-intensive, approach for
optimization of complex conditions.3−5 Many computational methods
(e.g., UNIFAC,6 linear free-energy relationship
(LFER) models,7 and COSMO-RS8) can replace experimental investigation in cases
when the components of the mixture are known. However, systematic
optimization of the extraction of unidentified substances without
squandering time and supplies in trial and error fashion is still,
to the best of our knowledge, a problem without a solution. It is
possible to estimate partition properties of a substance by its reverse-phase
chromatographic retention time, yet practically useful predictions
by this method are only expected for subsets of fairly similar solutes.9 Several methodologies for high-throughput determination
of distribution coefficients (log D) are available,10−12 but further reducing the experimental workload would still be desirable.

It is known that partition of a neutral solute between water and
an organic solvent may be satisfactorily described by a LFER equation
employing five parameters of the solute:7 the descriptors of hydrogen bond (HB) acidity, HB basicity, dipolarity,
polarizability, and molar volume. For ionizable solutes, at least
one additional descriptor accounting for the properties of the ion
is required. Obviously, the principle can be applied in reverse, and
various properties of the solute can be deduced from the pattern of
its partition/distribution coefficients in different solvent pairs.13−15 Thus, having established quantitative connections between the log D values of some model compounds in a variety of solvent
pairs, one can use them to predict distribution properties of an unknown
compound from a relatively small number of experimentally determined
values. Unlike computations, experimental log D determination is possible without identification of the solute(s),
even in the case of complex mixtures (see the Supporting Information for details and examples).

Training Data
and Prediction Algorithm
Log D values
for model compounds (training
data) may be obtained experimentally and/or computationally, provided
the computed values are of sufficient quality. In this work, we used
full factorial experimental design leading to the full data matrix
of experimental or experiment-derived log P/log D values of 30 lignin-related compounds
(depolymerization products and alike) in 20 solvent pairs. As lignin
is one of the most abundant renewable materials on Earth and also
a byproduct of several technological processes, its valorization is
increasingly gaining interest.16,17 The solutes included
24 neutral or weakly acidic compounds (mostly phenolic) and 6 aromatic
carboxylic acids; the solvent pairs were composed of 10 organic solvents
of various polarity and hydrogen-bonding ability (Figure 1) in combination with 2 aqueous
phases: neutral (pure water or phosphate buffer with pH = 7) and acidic
(0.1 M HCl). Neutral aqueous phase allows the effective separation
of carboxylic acids, which undergo extensive ionization at pH 7, from
weaker acids and neutral compounds. A sufficiently basic (pH >
10)
aqueous phase would likewise provide separation of weak acids from
nonionizable compounds, but could not be included in this dataset
due to experimental problems caused by alkaline solutions.

Figure 1 Organic solvents
and exemplary subset of solutes (see full list
in the Supporting Information) included
in the training data.

Various statistical methods may be used to build a model
for structure-independent
predictions, from the simple multilinear regression (MLR) used in
this work to the more sophisticated partial least squares18 and principal component analysis.19 Here, we do not aim to establish a well-defined
quantitative structure–activity relationship-like model, but
rather to explore the potential of the created optimization strategy
while allowing for adjustment according to the circumstances. The
proposed principal steps for identification of the most effective/selective
solvent pair are as follows:(a) adjust the training data (exclude
unsuitable solvent pairs, if any, and compounds known/suspected to
be considerably different from the solute of interest);

(b) select N reference
solvent pairs in which the unknown solute(s) will be studied experimentally;

(c) establish (multilinear)
relationships
between log D in reference solvent pairs and
the ones in which distribution is to be predicted (see eq 1);

(d) determine log D values in reference
solvent pairs experimentally;

(e) use equations from (c) and data from
(d) to predict log D values in all involved
solvent pairs. Choose the one best suiting your purpose.



With the MLR approach used in this work, the mathematical
model
developed in step (c) takes the form of eq 1 1  where X denotes a solvent
pair in which the solute was not studied experimentally, RSPi is a reference solvent pair, aX and ρX are the
corresponding model parameters (one constant a and N coefficients ρ for each X). The
comprehensive details of the algorithm, program codes, and numerical
examples of model parameters are provided in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Complexity of the relationships between log D values in different solvent pairs increases with the growing differences
between the solvents, e.g., their varying abilities for π–π
and HB interactions (Figure 2). The greater the diversity of the solvent pairs in the training
data, the more experimental values are needed for accurate predictions,
so a compromise between effort and gain is to be found. The number
of reference solvent pairs was optimized using leave-one-out cross
validation. The results are presented in Table 1.

Figure 2 Interrelations between the log P (toluene/0.1
M HCl in water) and log P values in three
other solvent pairs (X). The color of the data points
corresponds to the number of HB donor groups in the solute molecule;
the size of the points reflects the specific volume of the solute
(in Å3 amu–1).

For comparison, an estimate of the day-to-day reproducibility
of
the experiments, expressed as the weighted pooled standard deviation s (calculated by eq S3 in the
Supporting Information) is 0.08 log units. The behavior of carboxylic
acids was predicted less accurately than that of the weakly or nonacidic
solutes, which could be caused by either under-representation of acids
in the training data or underaverage quality of the corresponding
experimental values (s = 0.13). In further work,
we used five reference solvent pairs, which was reduced to four when
the solute of interest appeared to be nonionizable.

To test
the suitability of the model for predicting the most selective
conditions, the solvent pairs providing the greatest differences of
log D values of the two solutes were predicted
for all possible pairs of training set compounds. With 5 input log D values and the full training set, the most selective solvent
pairs were correctly identified in 60% of cases, predicted to be second-best
in 24% of cases, and third-best in 6% of cases. Therefore, with high-quality
data and dilute solutions, the actual best solvent pair is among the
predicted 3 best solvent pairs in 90% of cases.

However, the
created predictive approach relies on two assumptions
that may not hold under real working conditions: (1) there are no
interactions between the components of the mixture that could significantly
affect their partition, e.g., hydrogen bonding (including autoassociation)
and ion pairing (the probability of such interferences grows with
the concentration of solutions); (2) the training data includes compounds
with sufficiently similar structure/properties to the unknown solutes
and covers the involved log D range. Therefore,
even though the knowledge of exact solute structures is not required,
one should have some insight into the probable type(s) of the mixture
constituents and compile the training set accordingly. Another issue
is a potential need to account for the effects of cosolvents often
used in practical work.

Real-life performance of the prediction
algorithm was evaluated
via experiments with “difficult” mixtures: relatively
concentrated solutions (1–10%) of three plant-derived natural
products: cedar oil, black cumin seed oil, and colophony. The main
components of these substances are sesquiterpenes, fatty acids, and
abietic acid, respectively. Peaks of several unidentified components
allowing for sufficiently accurate integration and log D calculation were chosen on the chromatograms (see the Supporting Information for details).

As
expected, the absolute errors of prediction are larger in the
case of difficult mixtures than those in the case of training data:
the overall RMSE (in log units) is 0.3 for cedar oil, 0.5 for cumin
oil, and 0.4 for colophony. This may in part be caused by more chromatographic
interferences resulting in less reliable experimental data. By far
the largest prediction errors (Figure 3) belong to the solvent pairs including hexane—the
least polar of the included solvents. An additional series of experiments
(detailed in the Supporting Information) proved that extraction properties of low-polarity solvents when
applied to polar solutes are strongly affected by the presence of
relatively polar compounds (including the solute itself) in the organic
phase (a phenomenon called the “matrix effect” here).
At the same time, the extractive properties of HB-active solvents
proved virtually free of such influences. If an as accurate as possible
prediction is required for a solvent pair susceptible to matrix effects,
one should include similarly susceptible solvent pair(s) in the model
input. In the case of our data, inclusion of a matrix-effect-affected
value into the model input did not dramatically change the quality
of prediction for nonsusceptible solvent pairs.

Figure 3 Performance of the model
with some of the unidentified components
of colophony (apparently acidic, five input values used for prediction),
black cumin oil, and cedar oil (apparently nonionizable, prediction
with four input values). Solvents: 1—n-hexane,
2—toluene, 3—chlorobenzene, 4—dichloromethane,
5—tert-butyl methyl ether, 6—isopropyl
acetate, 7—benzyl alcohol, 8—cyclohexanol, 9—n-butanol, 10—n-octanol. Reference
solvent pairs are marked with asterisks.

Despite the relatively low absolute accuracy of prediction,
the
patterns of solute extraction behavior are reproduced well enough
to be of help in solving practical problems. The most effective (i.e.,
providing the highest log D of the solute)
extraction solvent of those not used as model input was identified
correctly in 5 cases out of 11 and predicted to be second- or third-best
in another 4 cases, which can be considered satisfactory in view of
the relatively narrow spans of the observed log D values.

A series of experiments also showed that the applicability
domain
of the model may be easily expanded from single-component organic
phases to certain binary solvents, and the effect of water-miscible
cosolvent can be accounted for with relatively little effort. However,
the accuracy of the correction will depend on the relative characteristics
of the cosolvent and the primary solvent. See the Supporting Information for more details.

Conclusions
It
was demonstrated that log D values of
an unknown solute in 6–15 solvent pairs may be predicted using
4 or 5 experimental log D values with an error
of 0.2–0.5 log units (depending on the magnitude of interferences),
which is comparable to experimental errors of high-throughput log D determination. Even when lacking absolute accuracy, the
predictions are useful for practical purposes, e.g., identification
of the solvent pairs providing the best extraction efficiency or selectivity.
The applicability domain of the approach can be potentially extended
to the optimization of other parameters (e.g., aqueous phase modifiers,
cosolvents, and temperature).

Experimental Section
The distribution
ratios of ligneous compounds were determined using
the shake-flask method followed by reverse-phase liquid-chromatographic
analysis of the formed organic and aqueous phases with UV–vis
detection. Most extractions were carried out with multisolute solutions
containing usually 6–7 compounds, with a total concentration
of circa 1.5 mg mL–1 (total mass of solutes divided
by the total volume of liquids). Suitable chromatographic methods
were created to achieve the separation of the solutes from each other
and from the UV–vis-active organic solvents. The experiments
were carried out at an ambient temperature of 23 ± 2 °C.

More experimental details, origin of the chemicals and equipment,
detailed evaluation of accuracy and error sources, and the obtained
distribution coefficient data are given in the Supporting Information.
