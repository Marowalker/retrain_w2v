Traditionally, ZnS
or ZnSe is chosen as the shell material for
InP quantum dots (QDs). However, for green or blue InP QDs, the ZnSe
shell will form a type-II structure resulting in a redshift of the
emission spectrum. Although the band gap of ZnS is wider, its lattice
mismatch with InP is larger (∼7.7%), resulting in more defect
states and lowered quantum yield (QY). To overcome the above problems,
we introduced the intermediate ZnMnS layer in InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs. The
wide band gap of the intermediate layer (3.7 eV) can confine the electrons
and holes in the core completely, and the formation of the type-II
structure is avoided. As a result, green InP-based QDs with QY up
to 80% were obtained. By adjusting the halogen ratios of the ZnX2 precursor, the minimum and maximum emission peaks are 470
and 620 nm, respectively, covering the whole visible range. Finally,
after optimizing the coating shell process, the maximum external quantum
efficiency of QD light-emitting diodes fabricated from this InP-based
green light QDs can reach 2.7%.

Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs)
are nanoscale semiconducting materials. Due
to the quantum confinement effect, the emission wavelength of QDs
gradually blueshifts with the decrease of size, so QDs covering the
whole visible range can be obtained by adjusting the size. Because
QDs are inorganic compounds, they have good stability. At the same
time, narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) can be obtained by
controlling reaction conditions1,2 which have started to
be deployed in liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight to achieve the
high color gamut.3,4 Ultimately, with a similar structure
to the organic light-emitting diode (OLED), the electroluminescence
QD light-emitting diode (QLED) is being considered as the next-generation
display technology featuring all the advantages of QD, with the similar
form factor of OLED.5−9

After nearly 2 decades of research, the QY of cadmium-based
QDs
is approaching 100% with an FWHM of less than 30 nm.10 However, cadmium is a class A heavy metal contaminant.
It is harmful to human health. At the same time, the European Union
announced that televisions and displays sold in Europe should be banned
from using cadmium since October 2019. Therefore, the prospect of
cadmium-based QLED is quite hazy. InP-based QDs are relatively environment-friendly.11 They have a larger exciton Bohr radius and adjustable
luminescence peak from blue to near-infrared. Thus, InP QDs have a
brighter future for displays. But compared with the traditional cadmium-based
QDs, the QY and FWHM of InP QDs are both far from satisfaction.12

At present, there are two hypotheses explaining
the wider FWHM
of InP QDs. One is that the reactivity of the phosphorus precursor
is too high and the reaction only needs a few seconds at high temperature,
which leads to insufficient monomer supply during the growth stage.
Thus, the reaction goes into the Ostwald ripening stage prematurely,
resulting in large size distribution.13 In spite of a variety of P precursors with weak reactivity tested,
the homogeneity is still not ideal.14 Another
hypothesis is that the magic size cluster (MSC) appears during the
nucleation and growth of nanocrystals, which makes that the nucleation
process deviates from the classical nucleation theory.15−17 Anyway, the mechanism is not clear yet. So far, the FWHM of green-emitting
InP QDs can be reduced to 36 nm by optimizing experimental conditions,
and its FWHM is close to the level of Cd-based QDs.18 Recently, Yang et al.35 reports
∼15nm InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, and a record EQE of 6.6% was achieved.
Peng et al.36 introduced stoichiometric
control in InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs. QLED showed a peak EQE of 12.2% and a
maximum brightness of 10,000 cd m–2. The above InP
QDs all use tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine [(TMS)3P] as
the P precursor since the use of (TMS)3P can synthesize
InP QDs with relatively good performance. However, the price of (TMS)3P is 80 times that of tris(dimethylamino)phosphine [(DMA)3P] and produces highly toxic phosphine (PH3, safe
concentration of <0.3 ppm) gas upon contact with air (phosphine
can affect the heart, respiratory system, kidney, stomach, nervous
system, and liver). Compared with (TMS)3P, (DMA)3P is more stable and does not produce toxic gas when exposed to air.
Recently, more and more researchers are using (DMA)3P to
synthesize InP QDs.19,20 In this work, we also synthesized
InP QDs using this cheap and low-toxicity P precursor.

Due to
the large lattice mismatch between InP and ZnS (7.7%), for
InP/ZnS QDs, there will be a large number of defects trapping excitons
at the core/shell interface, resulting in only 60% QY of InP/ZnS QDs.21−23 While the lattice mismatch between InP and ZnSe is small (3.3%),
the ZnSe intermediate layer is usually introduced between the InP
core and ZnS shell to reduce the defects caused by core/shell lattice
mismatch. However, for green- or blue-emitting InP/ZnSe QDs, due to
the lowest conduction band energy level of the shell, ZnSe is lower
than that of the core InP, the electrons in the core can easily transition
to the shell, and the peak position of InP/ZnSe QDs will redshift
relative to the InP/ZnS QDs.24 Since the
band gap of MnS is 3.7 eV,41 which is wider
than the green- or blue-emitting InP QDs, this shell can effectively
limit electrons and holes in the core, type-I structure QDs are formed,
and there is no redshift of the PL peak compared to InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs
with the same core size. Meanwhile, because the lattice mismatch between
MnS and InP is small (mismatch is about 4.3%), we choose ZnMnS alloy
as the intermediate layer can reduce the lattice mismatch between
the core InP and shell ZnS. For InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs, QY can reach up
to 80%. By adjusting the halogen ratios of the ZnX2 precursor,
the minimum and maximum emission peaks are 470 and 620 nm, respectively,
covering the whole visible range. By energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDX) element mapping, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, the results
show that Mn2+ has incorporated into QDs and the doping
content has been determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) quantitatively. Finally, using these InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs, we
fabricated QLED with 2.7% external quantum efficiency (EQE), which
consists of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/QDs/ZnxMg1–xONPs/Al.

Results and Discussion
Due to the promulgation of the cadmium restriction order, researchers
pay more and more attention on InP QDs. At present, the improvement
of QY of InP QDs is mainly through increasing the thickness of the
shell and reducing lattice mismatch between the core and shell. By
increasing the thickness of QDs, the energy transfer between QDs can
be effectively reduced, thus increasing QY. At the same time, by using
the intermediate layers such as ZnSe or GaP to reduce the lattice
mismatch between the core InP and shell ZnS, finally, defects can
be reduced. In this work, we have developed a new intermediate layer
material ZnMnS. Previous studies on Mn-doped QDs mainly focused on
their effects on the stability of materials. Due to the pinning effect
of doped Mn2+, the stability of QDs can be improved significantly.31 At the same time, Mn2+ emits 600
nm red light and has a wide FWHM (>60 nm), which can be used in
the
field of lighting. In this paper, we used Mn as an alloying element
in the ZnMnS intermediate layer. The ZnMnS intermediate layer has
the same effect as ZnSe in reducing lattice mismatch; at the same
time, it has a wide band gap, which can limit electrons and holes
in the core completely and overcome the shortcomings of ZnSe and ZnS
shells. The general experimental steps are as follows: the InP core
was first obtained by reacting (DMA)3P (2.4 mmol) with
InX3 (0.34 mmol) at 200 °C about 20 min in 5 mL of
oleylamine solution. MnCl2 was added and reacted for another
5 min at 250 °C. Then, the mixture was heated to 300 °C,
and 6.6 mmol of DDT and 6 mL of zinc precursor were injected immediately
into the above mixture for shell coating. After 45 min of reaction,
we obtained InP/ZnMnS core/shell QDs. After purification of the QDs,
the ZnS shell was continued to cover by injecting Zn(OA)2 and S-TOP. It can be seen from TEM that the size of InP/ZnMnS QDs
is 5.3 nm; after coating the ZnS shell, the size increases to 7.2
nm (see Figure 1).
By coating the ZnS shell, the energy transfer between QDs is reduced
and the stability of QDs can be improved at the same time.34,35 Finally, we obtained InP/ZnMnS/ZnS core/shell/shell QDs. Using these
InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs, we fabricated QLED, which consists of indium tin
oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PVK (30 nm)/QDs (40 nm)/ZnxMg1–xONPs (40
nm)/Al (100 nm).

QDs.

For the control of the QD size,
most research studies adjust the
size of QDs by controlling the reaction temperature, reaction time,
or ratio of precursors. In this work, we adjust the size of QDs by
controlling different halogens of the precursor. Due to the halogen
ions have strong coordination ability with indium ions, the InP monomer
can combine with a halogen to form an intermediate during the reaction,
and then the intermediate can form the InP core by dehalogenation.
Since different halogens have different coordination abilities with
the intermediate, therefore, different halogen ions can be used to
adjust the InP monomer formation rate.11 Finally, the InP core with different particle sizes can be obtained
by changing different halogen ratios.25 By changing the ratio of I, Br, and Cl, the wavelength of InP QDs
can be adjusted from 470 to 620 nm (see Figure 2). The FWHM of blue, green, and red QDs are
47, 62, and 81 nm, respectively, and QY can reach 38, 80, and 41%,
respectively. It is more effective and simpler than traditional methods
to obtain QDs with different sizes by controlling reaction time and
temperature, so this method has the potential to realize the mass
production of high-quality InP QDs.

After synthesizing the InP core, the temperature
was raised to
250 °C and MnCl2 was added for reaction for 5 min.
During this process, MnCl2 reacted with OLA to form the
Mn precursor. Then, the temperature was raised to 300 °C, and
the Zn precursor (zinc stearate mixed with ODE) and S precursor (DDT)
were added to coat the shell. In this process, the S precursor reacted
with Zn and Mn precursors to form the alloyed ZnMnS shell, and the
content of Mn2+ is measured by ICP-MS. It can be seen from
ICP-MS that the amount of added Mn2+ is different from
that of measured, which is mainly due to the different reactivity
of each precursor, and the final product proportion is far from that
of actual addition. With the continuous addition of MnCl2, the amount of Mn2+ in the shell gradually increases,
when the added MnCl2 exceeds 1.1 mmol, the amount of Mn2+ in the shell will exceed 14% (see Table 1), and the distance between the Mn2+ is decreasing gradually. When the distance between Mn2+ is less than the critical distance, energy transfer will occur between
them, that is, from one center to the next, until they enter a quenching
center, resulting in the quenching of luminescence.26,27 For InP/ZnMnS QDs (see Figure 1), the ion diffusion will occur at high temperature.
Because the valence of Mn2+ is different from that of In3+ and the radius of Mn2+ is 0.66 Å, it is
easier to replace Zn2+ (0.74 Å) than In3+ (0.8 Å), and it is difficult for Mn2+ to diffuse
to the core InP. The maximum doping amount of Mn2+ in the
InP core is only 0.07% (24 h reaction at 260 °C) according to
previous reports.28 For this experimental
condition (45 min reaction at 250 °C), it is difficult for Mn2+ to diffuse to the core.27 The
luminescence intensity of Mn2+ is gradually increase with
the increase of shell Mn2+ content (see Figure 2). When the amount of Mn2+ added exceeds 3.3 mmol, the emission peak intensity of Mn2+ remains unchanged. This is due to two reasons: one is due
to the saturation of Mn2+ at the surface of the InP core,
and the other is due to Mn2+ reaching the maximum doping
level in the shell (see Table 1).

Table 1 Ratio of Zn to Mn in InP/ZnMnS QDs
Measured by ICP-MS
QDs	Zn/Mn feed ratio	Zn/Mn ratio measured
in QDs	percentage of Mn in shell	τavg (ns)	
InP/ZnS	 	 	0%	46.6	
InP/Zn0.69Mn0.31S	0.5	2.23	30.9%	35.7	
InP/Zn0.48Mn0.52S	1	0.92	52.1%	16.0	
InP/Zn0.44Mn0.56S	1.5	0.79	55.8%	10.3	
InP/Zn0.43Mn0.57S	2	0.75	57.1%	10.2	
The PL peak of InP QDs is gradually
redshifted with the increase
of Mn2+ content. This is due to Mn2+ absorbs
the light emitted by the InP core, leading to fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) between the InP core and ZnMnS shell, and hence
in the redshift of the core InP emission peak.29−31 The fluorescence
lifetime of InP QDs decreases gradually with the increase of Mn2+ (see Table 1), the fluorescence lifetime is 46.6 ns for InP/ZnS QDs, with increasing
Mn2+ in the shell, and the lifetime of fluorescence decreases
gradually. When the content of Mn2+ reaches 57.1% of the
maximum doping content, the fluorescence lifetime decreases to 10.2
ns, and this change is consistent with the peak redshifted of InP
QDs (see Figure 3).
It is because the distance between the core InP and the shell Mn2+ is less than 10 nm, and the green light emitted by InP can
be absorbed by the shell Mn2+, resulting in energy transfer
from the InP core to the shell.34 We estimate
the efficiency for InP to Mn2+ (InP/Zn0.48Mn0.52S, the case in Figure 2B) to be E = 1 – τdonor – acceptor/τdonor =
1 – 15.96/46.65 = 65.79%. Because the luminescence of Mn2+ in QDs belongs to the discrete center luminescence,32 it is generated by the electron transition in
the 3d5 orbital (4T1-6A1),32 so the emission of Mn2+ has no significant correlation with its location (see Figure 4).The emission peak
remains unchanged with the increase of the Mn2+ doping
amount.

different shell structures.

process of Mn2+ dopants.

It can be seen from film XRD patterns that for InP/ZnS QDs, the
three strong peaks are 28.56°, 47.52°, and 56.29 °,
which correspond to the X-ray diffraction peaks of ZnS. With the increase
of Mn2+, the peak position of ZnS is shifted slightly (see Figure 5). This is because
Mn2+ enters the lattice of ZnS, resulting in a shift in
the peak position.32,33 From the element mapping results
of InP/ZnMnS QDs (see Figure 6), it can be seen that Mn2+ enter QDs, which are
consistent with the characterization of film XRD patterns.

of the sample with different Mn2+ contents.

Figure 6 Element mapping results of InP/ZnMnS QDs.

It can also be seen by lattice parameters of QDs that Mn2+ was incorporated into QDs (see Figure 7). The lattice parameter of InP/ZnS is 3.12
Å, which is matched with the lattice parameter of ZnS (3.123
Å). When Mn2+ was added, the lattice parameter of
InP/ZnMnS QDs is 3.20 Å, which is between MnS (3.24 Å) and
ZnS (3.123 Å), indicating that Mn2+ was doped into
QDs.

and (B) InP/ZnMnS QDs and corresponding lattice fringes.

Due to the narrow band gap of red InP QDs, the ZnSe, ZnS,
or MnS
shell can confine electrons and holes in the core completely, and
the peak positions of InP QDs are all 610 nm for these three kinds
of shell structures. But for green and blue InP QDs, only ZnS or MnS
shell with the wide band gap can restrict electrons and holes in the
core completely. However, for the ZnSe shell, its lowest conduction
band energy level is lower than that of InP, which results in the
electrons in the core transition to the shell layer and leads to the
redshift of the PL spectrum. The green InP QDs are redshifted from
507 to 558 nm, and the blue InP QDs are redshifted from 470 to 525
nm (see Figure 8).
As an intermediate layer, ZnMnS can reduce the lattice mismatch between
the core InP and shell ZnS, thus reducing the defects caused by lattice
mismatch and improving the luminescence efficiency of QDs. QY can
increase from 60% of InP/ZnS to 80% of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs.21

Using these InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs, we fabricated QLED,
which consists
of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PVK (30 nm)/QDs (40 nm)/ZnxMg1–xONPs
(40 nm)/Al (100 nm). The aluminum cathode layer is deposited by vacuum
thermal evaporation, and other layers are obtained by spin coating.
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto ITO glass and heat-treated at 130 °C
for 15 min and then PVK, QDs were spin-coated layer by layer, the
PVK layer was heat-treated at 120 °C for 15 min, and QDs layer
were heat-treated at 100 °C for 5 min. The ZnMgO nanoparticle
was spin-coated and then heat-treated at 80 °C for 20 min; after
that, the device was transferred into a vacuum chamber, and Al (100
nm) electrodes were deposited on the device.

Figure 9A show the
energy level diagram for the QLED we tested using these InP QDs. The
Tauc plot of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS was measured by ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectra. The band gap of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS (2.3 eV) QDs can
be calculated by the intercept between the tangent and abscissa of
the absorption spectrum. The CBM and VBM values of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs
were determined to be −5.1 and −7.4 eV by an ultraviolet
photoelectron spectrometer (UPS), respectively (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). Figure 9B shows the PL and EL spectrum of the InP/ZnMnS/ZnS
QDs. The peak of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QLED is at 517 nm. There is a redshift
of QLED compared with the PL peak at 513 nm, which is due to the Förster
energy transfer in the InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QLEDs films. Figure 9C shows that when the voltage
is 6 V, the maximum brightness can reach 420 cd/m2, and
when the voltage is 8 V, the maximum current density can reach 105
mA/cm2. The maximum EQE can up to 2.7% (see Figure 9D).

Conclusions
In summary, covering the whole visible range, InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs
were synthesized by controlling the ratio of I to Cl. The wavelength
of InP QDs can be adjusted from 470 to 620 nm. Because the valence
of Mn2+ is different from that of In3+ and the
radius of Mn2+ (0.66 Å) is different from that of
In3+ (0.8 Å), it is difficult for Mn2+ to
diffuse to the core InP. Due to the luminescence of Mn2+ in QDs belongs to the discrete center luminescence, it is generated
by the electron transition in the 3d5 orbital (4T1-6A1), so the emission of Mn2+ has no significant correlation with its location. At the
same time, XRD and mapping characterization were used to determine
whether Mn2+ was doped into the shell. For the ZnSe shell,
the lowest conduction band level is lower than that of green and blue
InP QDs, which results in the transition of the core InP electrons
to the shell and the redshift of the emission spectrum. For the ZnMnS
shell, the lowest conduction band level of ZnMnS is higher than that
of the core InP, and the electrons can be confined in the core and
no redshift of the PL spectrum. As an intermediate layer, ZnMnS can
reduce the lattice mismatch between the core InP and shell ZnS, thus
reducing the defects caused by lattice mismatch and improving the
luminescence efficiency of QDs. QY can increase from 60% of InP/ZnS
to 80% of InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs. The maximum EQE of this QLED fabricated
from this Cd-free green light QDs can reach 2.7%.

Device Fabrication
Using these InP/ZnMnS/ZnS QDs, we
fabricated QLED, which consists of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS
(30 nm)/PVK (30 nm)/QDs (40 nm)/ZnxMg1–xONPs (40 nm)/Al (100 nm). The aluminum
cathode layer is deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation, and other
layers are obtained by spin coating. ITO glass was cleaned with toluene,
acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol under ultrasonication successively
for 20 min and then ultraviolet (UV)-light treated for 20 min before
usage. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083, filtered through a 0.45 mm
filter) was spin-coated onto ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 45 s and heat-treated
at 130 °C for 15 min and then PVK (dissolve in chlorobenzene,

°C for 15 min, and QDs layer were heat-treated at 100 °C
