Here,
we propose a plasmon-induced redistribution of a thin polymer
layer as a unique way for a residual layer-free lithographic approach.
In particular, we demonstrate an ultrafast area-selective fabrication
method using a low-intensity visible laser irradiation to direct the
polymer mass flow, under the plasmon-active substrates. Plasmon-supported
substrates were created by thermal annealing of Ag thin films and
covered by thin polystyrene layers. Then, laser beam writing (LBW)
was applied to introduce a surface tension gradient through the local
plasmon heating. As a result, polystyrene was completely removed from
the irradiated place, without any residual layer. The proposed approach
does not require any additional development steps, such as solvent
or plasma treatment. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
technique, we implemented the LBW-patterned structures for further
spatially selective surface functionalization, including the metal
deposition, spontaneous thiol grafting, and electrochemical deposition
of ordered polypyrrole array.

Introduction
The lithographic methods
should provide rapid, high-resolution
patterning, with high throughput, maximal structure resolution, and
an opportunity to control the created structure.1,2 The
use of thin polymer film instability represents an elegant way for
polymer pattering, which satisfies the above-mentioned requirements.3−5 The physical background of thin film instability and related polymer
mass redistribution is typically explained within the framework of
Marangoni flow, assuming that under the action of a surface tension
gradient, a system tends to evolve toward a stable state by minimizing
its surface area through the material flow.6,7 The
Marangoni-driven mass redistribution was successfully applied to create
self-assembled polymer structures and the structures with arbitrary
symmetry and, more recently, for the nanoscale removal of a protective
thin film by resistive heating of carbon nanotubes.8−12 Because the surface tension is a function of several
parameters, the introduction of its gradient can be performed through
several technological approaches, including the use of vertical or
horizontal constant thermal treatment, transverse zone annealing,
and so on.4,13−17

Recently, a laser light interaction with polymers
and related phenomena
were proposed as an alternative process to introduce the surface tension
gradient.18−22 This was implemented through the application of laser annealing
of bottom substrates, initiating the flow of metal-coated polymers.19,23 The local temperature spike at the laser spot leads to rapid local
heating followed by a rapid temperature drop, which is the driving
force for polymer flow.19,20 The use of such a laser-based
route for thin polymer film patterning is advantageous for its high
speed and the ability to form a structure with arbitrary shape and
last but not least cost- and time-efficiency.24,25 To ensure the effective laser patterning of the polymer and produce
the thermal gradient, the efficient absorption of laser energy should
be guaranteed. In the work of Singer et al., the light absorption
was achieved through the supporting of the polymer film by semiconductor
surface and utilization of infrared (IR) laser source.18−20 An alternative approach, proposed by our research group, was an
incorporation of dye molecules into a polymer, which provides an effective
light absorption.26,27 Recently, we combined both approaches,
that is, the deposition of thin and transparent polymer film on the
plasmon-active substrates with a subsequent scanning with visible
light (450 nm).28 In particular, we have
shown dewetting of thin polymer films [e.g., polystyrene (PS)] as
a grayscale form of resist-free positive-tone lithography.28 In this work, we demonstrated the advantages
of the proposed approach for residual-free lithography, leading to
complete polymer removal from the illuminated place and requiring
no additional preparation steps for further underlying substrate modification,
such as wet or plasma-based procedures.

Results and Discussion
A schematic representation of the proposed experimental concept
for the residual-free lithography approach is presented in Figure 1. First, a thin PS
film (50 nm thickness) was spin-coated on the plasmon-active substrate
(Ag nanoclusters), with a pronounced absorption maximum “near”
450 nm and laser-scanned at corresponding laser light wavelength (450
nm). Because we used the transparent polymer film [the impact of laser
beam writing (LBW) on the pristine PS layer without underlying is
presented in Figure S1, and there was no
any polymer redistribution or ablation], the laser light is absorbed
only in the substrate and produces a temperature gradient in both,
vertical and horizontal directions. The temperature gradient results
in appearance of the surface tension gradient, leading to a flow of
polymer out of the illuminated area. Because the neighboring substrate
remains intact, a polymer mask is created, opening the way for further
surface modification (Figure 1). Indeed, the necessary condition for the further substrate
modification is a complete removal of the polymer under the plasmon-based
heating. In the next step, the created structures (with a patterned
PS mask) were used for the following: (i) grafting of thiol compound,
(ii) vacuum deposition of Pt, or (iii) electrochemical polypyrrole
(PPy) growth (Figure 1). Created in these ways, surface structures were revealed by the
PS mask removing.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the proposed experimental
concept for
the residual-free lithography approach: LBW-patterned thin PS layer;
grafting of neighboring substrate through the PS mask; and PS removing
and outcrop underlying structure.

The proposed experimental concept uses plasmon support to
efficiently
convert laser light energy to the surface plasmon heating and creation
of temperature/surface tension gradient.29,30 The vacuum-sputtered continuous Ag thin film was disrupted by the
thermal annealing to create a substrate with an efficient light-plasmon-heat
conversion. The annealing leads to the disruption of the continuous
metal film into an array of Ag clusters, exhibiting pronounced plasmon
resonance.31 Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and UV–vis results from the plasmonic substrates produced in
this way are presented in Figure 2. As is evident from the AFM scans, the initial flat
Ag thin film (Figure 2A) is disrupted in the clusters array with relatively narrow size
and shape distribution (Figure 2B). The pristine Ag film shows the plasmon absorption band,
which is relatively wide (Figure 2C). The subsequent annealing of Ag films leads to the
appearance of well-pronounced and narrow plasmon absorption band,
with the maximum located near 432 nm. The laser wavelength, used for
further polymer patterning, performed after polymer deposition, corresponds
well with plasmon absorption maximum (see Figure 2C—dot line). Among the commonly used
light absorbers, the different carbon-based or semiconductor structures
can be mentioned.12,19,23 Their utilization provides a relatively flat surface without the
need for the additional annealing step. On the other hand, the deposition
and annealing of thin metal films here suggested provides an alternative
way, which can be applied on the almost all kinds of underlying surfaces
(including the amorphous materials), with only one condition of thermal
stability against the applied annealing procedure.

Figure 2 (A,B) AFM images of the
thin Ag film before and after annealing,
(C) UV–vis spectra of as-sputtered annealed Ag.

In the next step, a 50 nm thick PS layer was spin-coated
on the
plasmon-supported substrates and exposed to the LBW procedure. LBW
was performed by the subsequent writing of several lines on the sample
surface, and the created pattern is presented in Figure 3 with two AFM scans taken at
two AFM resolutions. The LBW parameters were optimized to achieve
the array of well-separated lines without their imposing at the maximal
available speed of the surface patterning (see Figures S3 and S4). As is evident, the application of LBW
resulted in the formation of perfectly ordered structures due to the
thermal and surface tension gradients, which induce the PS outflow
from the illuminated places. At the boundary of illuminated spots,
the polymer flow is stopped and two boundary convexities are formed
(Figure 3A,B). The
more detailed AFM scans and corresponding surface profile are presented
in Figure 3C,D. The
surface morphology between the lines represents the flat surface,
with the depth, corresponding well with the thickness of the deposited
PS layer, the fact indicating complete removal of the polymer from
the illuminated line. The conservation of the PS structure during
the patterning procedure was checked using the IR spectroscopy, and
results the indicate the absence of any chemical changes and polymer
degradation (Figure S2).

The abovedescribed process of residual-free polymer patterning
enables us to perform the surface modification of the underlying substrate
without the need for additional procedures, usually required for removing
of residual PS (e.g., plasma etching). To demonstrate this advantage,
we applied three different procedures: (i) the vacuum deposition of
Pt, (ii) surface modification with cysteine, (iii) and surface-assisted
PPy polymerization. The procedures were followed by the polymer removing
and characterization of remained structures. The results of scanning
electron microscopy (SEM)–energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements performed
after the Pt deposition (10 nm thickness) are shown in Figure 4 and Table S1. The SEM image (Figure 4A) indicates the appearance of ordered line array (after
the PS removal), with the parameters (width and periodicity) corresponding
well with the previously created grooves in the PS layer. In turn,
the EDS maps (Figure 4B,C) show the homogeneous distribution of Ag and presence of apparent
Pt-lines. Apparently, the vacuum-deposited Pt reaches the really bare
substrate and remains stable after the PS mask removing. So that,
the proposed residual-free LBW approach opens the possibility to deposit
the metal (or others) structures on the substrate in a simple way,
without additional steps, traditionally applied for the elimination
of polymers mask residue.

Figure 4 First example of residual-free LBW utilization
(vacuum deposition
of Pt): (A) SEM image of the vacuum-deposited Pt array; corresponding
EDS maps of silver (B) and platinum (C).

Figure 5 and Table S1 represent the second example of residual-free
LBW application, that is, grafting of cysteine molecules to Ag nanoclusters,
followed by the polymer removing. After the samples soaking in the
toluene, the SEM image (Figure 5A) indicates a relatively flat surface without apparent morphological
features (Ag clusters are not visible under present resolution). In
turn, EDS (and XPS) measurements show the apparent surface sulfur
peak. The corresponding element maps indicate a homogeneous Ag distribution
(Figure 5B) and sulfur
location in the ordered lines form. The visible sulfur lines corresponding
well with the previously created LBW pattern can arise only from the
conjugated cysteine molecules. Because the cysteine molecules are
able to graft only the Ag surface (without the residual PS), the EDS
results confirm the creation of a completely bare silver surface after
the LBW procedure.

Figure 5 Second example of residual-free LBW utilization (surface
modification
with cysteine): (A) SEM image of the vacuum-deposited Pt array; corresponding
EDS maps of silver (B) and sulfur (C).

Finally, Figure 6 and Table S1 show the third example
of
the use of residual-free LBW, that is, a growth of PPy ordered line
array. In this case, we used the conductive indium tin oxide (ITO)
substrate, instead of microscopic glass (the control results of AFM,
and UV–vis measurements are similar to those presented in Figure 2). The SEM scan,
performed after the PS removing, indicates the formation of perfectly
ordered line array, with the symmetry, corresponding to LBW-created
PS mask (Figure 6A).
A more detailed SEM image (Figure 6B) shows a rough nature of a single-line surface that
was further confirmed by the AFM scans (Figure 6E,F). Such surface morphology is typical
for PPy electrochemical surface-assisted polymerization.32 In addition, AFM scans demonstrate that the
created PPy structures are more pronounced at the edges of PS lines,
probably because of capillary effects. As can be expected, the results
of EDS mapping show the significantly higher concentration of carbon
and nitrogen on the created lines (after the PS removing), the fact
confirming the formation of PPy ordered array (Figure 6C,D).

Figure 6 Third example of residual-free LBW utilization
(surface-assisted
PPy polymerization): (A,B) SEM images of the PPy lines; corresponding
EDS maps of nitrogen (C) and carbon (D); AFM-measured surface topography
of a single PPy line (E,F).

Finally, it must be also noted that the creation of the periodical
structures on thin polymer films can be realized through the surface
modification by excimer laser or introduction of light-isomerisable
chemical moieties in the polymer structure followed by the utilization
of interference-based light gradients.33−36 Both methods possess a range
of advantages but significantly limited by the presence of the residual
polymer layer, which may result in the graphitization of material
as well as restrict the geometry of created structures. In turn, the
method proposed here enables to create various surface patterns, examples
of which are presented in Figure S5. In
combination with previously described examples, we can convincingly
state that the residual-free LBW approach can be directly used for
mask-based, spatially selective, physical or chemical modification
of substrates. Note that the common lithographic process is traditionally
complicated by the need of additional steps for the removing of the
residual polymer layer. In this work, we have shown the first example
of residual-free LBW approach, which leads to the full outcrop of
the neighboring substrate, without the residual polymer layer for
further potential disposal in the field of optics, electronics, or
biology.

Conclusions
In this work, we present the LBW approach
which is based on the
plasmon heating of thin polymer film and the creation of temperature
gradient, necessary for induction of polymer mass redistribution.
The main advantage of our approach lies in the full removal of polymer
from the illuminated area, which makes the structure appropriate for
further spatially selective surface functionalization, without the
need of additional technological processes, such as solvent or plasma
treatments, for polymer residual removing. The plasmon structure was
created by the annealing of thin continuous Ag films, by which the
Ag cluster array was formed, with pronounced plasmon absorption band
gap. The thin layer of PS was further deposited on the plasmonic substrate
and treated with the laser beam, at a wavelength corresponding to
the maximum of plasmon absorption. The full removal of the polymer
from the illuminated area and the absence of the residual polymer
layer were checked in three experiments: deposition of Pt, immersion
in the cysteine solution, and electrochemical PPy polymerization.
After the PS mask removal, the inverse pattern was obtained in all
cases, indicating the success of the proposed residual-free lithographic
approach.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ag and Pt targets (purity
of 99.9999%) were
supplied from Safina s.r.o., l-cysteine (97.0%) and pyrrole
(98.0%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and PS was provided by (Goodfellow,
Ltd.).

Sample Preparation
The thin Ag layer (20 nm) was deposited
on precleaned glass substrates (15 × 15 × 1 mm) and annealed
at 450 °C in argon (Ar) atmosphere for 10 min. For PPy coverage,
conductive glass/ITO substrates were used. After cooling, the samples
were covered with a 50 ± 5 nm thick PS layer by spin-coating
(1500 rpm for 2 min). For LBW, the continuous laser source with 450
nm wavelength and 50 mW power (internal power, without losses on optical
paths) was focused on the polymer surface using the 50× objective
(light spot ca. 10 μm) under the continuous sample movement
(0.05–5 cm s–1 speeds range). Laser scanning
was carried out in the form of parallel lines writing (the distances
in the range of 10–25 μm between lines).

Surface Modification
through the Patterned PS Mask
The deposition of a thin Pt
layer was accomplished on a Balzers SCD
050 device from the Pt target (direct current Ar plasma, discharge
power of 7.5 W, pressure of 5 Pa, 300 s sputtering time). The grafting
of cysteine was performed by samples soaking in 10 mM water solution
overnight. After soaking, the samples were carefully rinsed with distilled
water and then with toluene under sonication. PPy deposition was carried
out through the immersion of samples in the reaction mixture (20 mL
of 0.5 M pyrrole monomer and 1.5 mL of 0.1 M KH2PO4) at room temperature under the constant voltage (+6 V) in
a two-electrode system. The sample was attached on a positively charged
electrode by the clip. The average current flow was 0.5 mA for 60
s. After PPy synthesis, the samples were very carefully rinsed with
distilled water.

Sample Characterization
UV–vis
spectra were
taken at room temperature in the range of 250–1100 nm (PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 25 spectrophotometer). The surface morphologies of samples
were characterized by AFM Icon (Bruker) in a peak-force mod. SEM measurements
were performed with a Tescan Lyra3 GMU microscope with 5 kV acceleration
voltage. Elemental composition and mapping were measured by an EDS
analyzer (X-MaxN) with a 20 mm2 SDD detector (Oxford Instruments)
and evaluated using AZtecEnergy software. The additional XPS measurements
were performed using the Omicron Nanotechnology ESCAProbeP spectrometer
fitted with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source. The analyzed
area had dimensions of 1 × 2 mm2. Concentrations of
elements were calculated in at. % using manufacturer’s sensitivity
factors.
