Kinesin
is a typical molecular motor that can step processively
on microtubules powered by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
molecules, playing a critical role in intracellular transports. Its
dynamical properties such as its velocity, stepping ratio, run length,
dissociation rate, etc. as well as the load dependencies of these
quantities have been well documented through single-molecule experimental
methods. In particular, the run length shows a dramatic asymmetry
with respect to the direction of the load, and the dissociation rate
exhibits a slip–catch–slip bond behavior under the backward
load. Here, an analytic theory was provided for the dynamics of kinesin
motors under both forward and backward loads, explaining consistently
and quantitatively the diverse available experimental results.

1 Introduction
The kinesin protein is a typical biological molecular motor that
performs mechanical work powered by the free energy released from
the chemical reaction.1−6 Kinesin (concretely kinesin-1) constitutes two identical motor domains
(heads) connected together by a coiled-coil stalk through their neck
linkers (NLs).7 It can step processively
on microtubules (MTs) toward the plus end by hydrolyzing adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) molecules, which play a critical role in intracellular
transports. To dissect the biophysical mechanism of the kinesin movement,
many of the quantities that characterize the motor dynamics have been
well documented through different experimental methods. For example,
with single-molecule optical tweezer techniques, the dependencies
of quantities such as the velocity, forward-to-backward stepping ratio
(abbreviated to stepping ratio), dwell time between two successive
mechanical steps, etc. on the external force or load in both the backward
and forward directions were determined.8−17 In particular, the single-molecule results,17,18 which were reproduced by computational simulations,19,20 showed interestingly that the run length is dramatically asymmetric
with respect to the direction of the external force acting on the
coiled-coil stalk with the run length under a moderate forward force
being much smaller than under a moderate backward force.

Apart
from the abovementioned quantities, the dissociation rate
of the motor from its track during its processive motion is another
important quantity to characterize its dynamic behaviors. Particularly,
to study theoretically and computationally the cooperative transports
by multiple molecular motors, besides the velocity versus force relations
of the single motors, their dissociation rate versus force relations
are also indispensable.21−31 Following the concept of Kramers theory, the dissociation rate of
a motor is usually argued to be an exponential function of the force.
However, the available experimental evidence indicated that the dissociation
rate of the kinesin motor exhibits a slip–catch–slip
bond behavior: as the backward force increases, the dissociation rate
first increases then decreases and then increases again.22 Recent computational simulations also showed
that the dissociation rate exhibits the slip–catch–slip
bond behavior.32

Although a lot of
analytical and/or computational studies have
been presented on the dynamics of kinesin molecular motors,19,20,33−42 an analytical theory is still lacking, which can give consistent
and quantitative explanations of the dependencies of the quantities
such as the velocity, stepping ratio, run length, dissociation rate,
etc. upon both forward and backward forces and particularly the dramatic
asymmetry of the run length with respect to the force direction as
well as the slip–catch–slip bond behavior for the dissociation
rate under the backward force. The purpose of this work is to present
such an analytical theory.

2 Model
2.1 Chemomechanical
Coupling Pathway
The model for the chemomechanical coupling
pathway of the kinesin
at saturating concentrations of ATP is schematically shown in Figure 1, which is modified
slightly from that presented before.19,20,41,42 It is set up based
mainly on the following three elements: (i) A kinesin head in an empty
(ϕ), ATP, or ADP·Pi state has a strong interaction with
an MT-tubulin heterodimer,43 inducing conformational
changes in the MT tubulin.44 After the
MT-bound ADP·Pi head releases Pi, it temporally has a much lower
binding energy (Ew1) to the local MT tubulin
(with the conformational changes) than the weak binding energy (Ew2) to other MT tubulins (without the conformational
changes).45 Since the weak interaction
of the ADP head with the MT tubulin induces nearly no conformational
change in the MT tubulin,45 in a time period tr of the order of microseconds after the head
releases Pi, the local MT tubulin restores elastically to its normally
unchanged conformation with the binding energy between the ADP head
and the local MT tubulin changing from Ew1 to Ew2. (ii) When the MT-bound head
is in the ATP or ADP·Pi state, a large conformational change
of the head can take place,46 enabling
the NL to dock into the head,15,46,47 while in the ϕ or ADP state, the large conformational change
cannot take place46 with the NL docking
unable to occur.15,46,47 (iii) The MT-bound head without the large conformational change
has a strong affinity for the ADP head while with the conformational
change has a much weaker affinity, as atomistic MD simulations indicated.48 The detailed correlations among the ATPase activity,
reduction of the affinity between two heads, and NL docking are described
in the Supporting Information (Section S2).

Figure 1 Model of kinesin chemomechanical coupling. (a–k) Pathway
of kinesin stepping at saturating ATP and occurrence of weak MT-binding
periods (including periods I and II) when the dimer binds weakly to
MT (see text for detailed descriptions). The thickness of the arrow
denotes the magnitude of the transition rate or probability under
no load. For simplicity, ATP hydrolysis and Pi release are treated
here as one step with the symbol ATP representing both ATP and ADP·Pi
states, because in both ATP and ADP·Pi states the head binds
strongly to the MT. As a result, the change of ATP to ADP shown here
consists of two sequential transitions including the transition of
ATP to ADP·Pi and that of ADP·Pi to ADP. Since at saturating
ATP after ATP release from the leading head, another ATP molecule
can bind immediately, and the lifetime of the nucleotide-free state
is so short that the nucleotide-free state is neglected here.

Let us begin the chemomechanical coupling cycle
of the kinesin
dimer with its two heads in the ATP state bound strongly to the MT
with the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP) of the trailing head closed
while the NBP of the leading head open (see Section S2) (Figure 1a). The trailing head has a much higher rate of ATP hydrolysis and
Pi release than that of the leading head (see the next section or Section S2). After ATP hydrolysis and Pi release
taking place in the trailing head (opening its NBP), the head dissociates
easily from binding site I on the MT by overcoming Ew1 and diffuses rapidly to the intermediate (INT) position
relative to the MT-bound head where the two heads have a high binding
energy (Figure 1b).
Then, the closing of the NBP and large conformational change of the
MT-bound ATP head can take place, weakening greatly its affinity for
the ADP head and inducing its NL docking (Section S2) (Figure 1c). With a probability PE, the ADP head
can diffuse forward rapidly and bind to site III with affinity Ew2 (Figure 1d). Then, ADP release occurs in the leading head followed
immediately by ATP binding (Figure 1e). Figure 1e is the same as Figure 1a except that the dimer took a forward step of size d = 8.2 nm, the distance between two successive binding
sites on an MT filament.

From Figure 1b,
ATP hydrolysis and Pi release in the MT-bound head can also take place
occasionally before weakening of its affinity for the ADP head occurs
(Figure 1f). During
the time period tr (called period I) before
the affinity of the ADP head for the local MT tubulin changes from Ew1 to Ew2, the kinesin
dimer (with the two heads bound together by high affinity) can easily
detach from the MT by overcoming Ew1.
From Figure 1d, ATP
hydrolysis and Pi release can also take place occasionally in the
trailing head before ADP release occurs in the leading head. The trailing
ADP head then detaches from site II and diffuses to the INT position
where the two ADP heads have a large binding energy (Figure 1g). During the time period
(called period II) before ADP release occurs in the MT-bound head,
the kinesin dimer can detach from the MT by overcoming Ew2 with high probability. If the dimer has not detached
until ADP release occurs in the MT-bound head, after ATP binding,
the dimer becomes the state of Figure 1h that is the same as Figure 1b except that the dimer took a forward step.

From Figure 1c,
with the probability 1 – PE, the
detached ADP head can also diffuse backward and bind to site I with
affinity Ew2 (noting that, after detaching
from site I, the affinity of the ADP head for site I changes rapidly
to Ew2 in the time tr of the order of microseconds) (Figure 1i). It is noted that, in Figure 1i, due to the effect of the
NL in the backward and horizontal direction, the reverse conformational
change of the leading head takes place and its NBP becomes open (see Section S2). From Figure 1i, after ADP release occurs in the trailing
head and then ATP binds, the system returns to Figure 1a. From Figure 1i, ATP hydrolysis and Pi release in the leading
head can also take place occasionally before ADP release occurs in
the trailing head. The leading ADP head then detaches from site II
and diffuses to the INT position where the two ADP heads have a large
binding energy (Figure 1j). During the time period (period II) before ADP release occurs
in the MT-bound head, the dimer can detach from MT by overcoming Ew2 with high probability. If the dimer has not
detached until ADP release occurs in the MT-bound head, after ATP
binding, the dimer becomes the state of Figure 1k that is the same as Figure 1b except that the dimer took a backward step.

It is mentioned that, in Figure 1a, ATP hydrolysis and Pi release can also take place
occasionally in the leading head before taking place in the trailing
head, which is not drawn here. As discussed elsewhere,41,42 if this case occurs, the leading head easily detaches from site
II by overcoming Ew1 and diffuses to the
INT position. From the INT position with the probability 1 – PE, the detached ADP head can diffuse toward
the minus end of the MT and bind to the site next to site I with affinity Ew2. This leads to the dimer taking a backward
step. From the INT position with the probability PE, the detached ADP head can also diffuse toward the plus
end of the MT and rebind to site II with affinity Ew2. This leads to a futile chemomechanical coupling.

2.2 Force-Independent but NL-Orientation-Dependent
ATPase Rate of the Kinesin Head
Consider an external force, F, acting on the coiled-coil stalk connecting the two NLs
as done in the single-molecule optical tweezer experiments.8−18 The previous experimental results indicated that the extension of
the NL in each head of the kinesin dimer has little influence on the
ATPase rate of the kinesin dimer during its processive motion.49 Because varying the NL length varies significantly
the internally elastic force on the NLs of the two heads bound to
MT,39 the experimental results hence mean
that the force on the NL has little influence on the ATPase rate of
the kinesin head (at least the rate of the rate-limiting step of the
ATPase activity, namely, ATP hydrolysis and Pi release). As a consequence,
it is proposed that the rate of ATP hydrolysis and Pi release of the
kinesin head is independent of the force on its NL.39−42 However, the rate of ATP hydrolysis
and Pi release depends sensitively on the orientation of the NL: the
head with its NL in the forward orientation has a much larger rate
than the head with its NL not in the forward orientation.39−42 This can be explained as follows. The interaction of the NL in the
forward orientation with the head enhances the rate of ATP hydrolysis
and Pi release (see also Section S2). This
is in accordance with the experimental evidence in that the deletion
of the NL in the kinesin head reduced greatly its ATPase rate while
having no influence on its ADP release rate50 because, after ATP binding and before Pi release, the docked NL
is in the forward orientation. For simplicity, we treat here that
the rate of ADP release from the MT-bound head (the non-rate-limiting
step of the ATPase activity) is a constant independent of the force
on and orientation of its NL. When the head is detached from the MT,
the rate of ADP release is zero.

3 Results
and Discussion
In this work, it is defined that the force F in
the backward direction has a positive value. Since F acts on the coiled-coil stalk connecting the two NLs that are flexible,
it is reasonably considered that, during the movement of the detached
head relative to the other MT-bound head, a backward force (F > 0) acts solely on the NL of the head in the front
position
while a forward force (F < 0) acts solely on the
NL of the head in the rear position.41,42 Thus, after
the trailing head releases Pi and detaches from site I, the backward
force has no influence on and the forward force facilitates the diffusion
of the ADP head to the INT position with the ADP head arriving at
the INT position (i.e., Figure 1a transitioning to Figure 1b) within time tr with
a probability nearly equal to 1. After the leading head releases Pi
and detaches from site II, the backward force facilitates and the
forward force has no influence on the diffusion of the ADP head to
the INT position with the ADP head arriving at the INT position within
time tr with a probability nearly equal
to 1. On the other hand, in the INT state after the affinity between
the two heads is reduced, the ADP head can move to the forward binding
site on the MT with probability PE or
move to the backward binding site with probability 1 – PE (see Figure 1). Consequently, it is noted that, if Pi release occurs
in the trailing head, the motor either takes a forward step of size d = 8.2 nm with probability PE or does not move with probability 1 – PE and, if Pi release occurs in the leading head, the motor
either does not move with probability PE or takes a backward step of size d = 8.2 nm with
probability 1 – PE.

We denote
by k(+) the rate of ATP hydrolysis
and Pi release in the trailing head with its NL in the forward orientation, k(−) the rate of ATP hydrolysis and Pi
release in the leading head with its NL not in the forward orientation,
and kD the rate of ADP release from the
ADP head after binding to the MT. Considering that, in the INT state,
the affinity between the two heads is reduced with a rate (which is
equal to the NL docking rate, kNL, under
no load) much higher than k(+) ≫ k(−) (see Table 1) and the two weak MT-binding periods (periods
I and II) occur with very low probabilities in a chemomechanical coupling
cycle, for a good approximation, we can neglect the occurrences of
the INT state and the two weak MT-binding periods in calculations
of the overall ATPase rates. From the model, it is noted that, during
the processive motion, the state of the dimer with the trailing head
bound to ATP and the leading head bound to ADP (e.g., Figure 1d) occurs with probability PE, while the state of the dimer with the trailing
head bound to ADP and the leading head bound to ATP (e.g., Figure 1i) occurs with probability
1 – PE. Consequently, the overall
ATPase rates of the trailing and leading heads can be calculated as 1   2  where kT and kL are ATPase
rates of the
trailing and leading heads, respectively. The motor steps forward
and backward with the overall rates PEkT and (1 – PE)kL, respectively. Therefore,
the pathway of Figure 1 can be simplified to the one shown in Figure 2. The total ATPase rate of the motor is k = kT + kL. Substituting eqs 1 and 2 into the above expression, we
obtain 3  

Figure 2 Simplified model of stepping of the kinesin
dimer at saturating
ATP. The simplified model is derived from the pathway illustrated
in Figure 1 where the
two weak MT-binding periods (including periods I and II) that can
only occur with very low probabilities in a chemomechanical coupling
cycle can be neglected. The green circle denotes the kinesin dimer.
The binding sites on the MT filament are indicated by ..., (i – 1), i, (i +
1), .... The kinesin dimer steps forward with the rate PEkT and backward with the
rate (1 – PE)kL where PE is the effective
chemomechanical coupling probability, kT is the ATPase rate of the trailing head, and kL is the ATPase rate of the leading head.

It is noted that, for kD ≫ k(+) ≫ k(−), eqs 1–3 become kT = k(+), kL = k(−), and k = k(+) + k(−), which are identical to those studied before.41,42

3.1 Stepping Ratio and Velocity
To derive
the expressions for force dependencies of the stepping ratio and velocity,
we first derive the expression for the force dependence of probability PE. Let us consider the backward force (F > 0) and forward force (F < 0)
separately.

First, focus on F > 0. Since F > 0 resists the forward motion of the detached ADP
head from the
INT to leading position (see above), the force dependence of the rate
for the ADP head to change from the INT state to the state binding
to the forward binding site on the MT can be written as kFwd = C1 exp ( – βFd( + )) where C1 is a constant independent of F, d(+) is the characteristic distance for the motion
from the INT position to the forward binding site, and β–1 = kBT is the thermal energy. Since F > 0 has no influence
on the motion of the detached ADP head from the INT to the trailing
position (see above), the rate for the ADP head to change from the
INT state to the state binding to the backward binding site on MT
can be written as kBwd = C1 exp ( – βENL) where ENL is the NL-docking energy
(more precisely, ENL is the free energy
change associated with both the NL docking and large conformational
change induced by ATP binding).42 The probability PE can be calculated with PE = kFwd/(kFwd + kBwd). Substituting kFwd and kBwd into
the above expression, we obtain 4  

In the above
derivation of eq 4, we
have considered that the NL docking has no effect on
the forward motion of the ADP head from the INT position to the forward
binding site on the MT while having a resistant effect on the backward
motion to the backward binding site. Alternatively, we consider that
the NL docking facilitates the forward motion of the ADP head to the
forward binding site while having no effect on the backward motion
to the backward binding site. Then, the force dependencies of the
rate for the forward and backward motions can be written as kFwd = C1 exp (βENL) exp ( – βFd( + )) and kBwd = C1, respectively. Thus, from PE = kFwd/(kFwd + kBwd), we obtain the
same eq 4. This implies
that shifting along the horizontal direction the potential characterizing
the effect of NL docking on the motion of the detached ADP head has
no influence on PE, which has been checked
numerically by using Brownian dynamics simulations used in Guo et
al.39

Second, focus on F < 0, which has no influence
on the motion of the ADP head from the INT to leading position and
resists the motion to the trailing position (see above). Thus, for
the case that the NL docking has no effect on the forward motion of
the ADP head from the INT position to the forward binding site, the
rates for the ADP head to change from the INT state to the state binding
to the forward and backward sites on MT can be written as kFwd = C2 and kBwd = C2 exp ( –
βENL) exp (βFd( – )), respectively, where C2 is a constant independent of F and d(−) is the characteristic distance for
the motion from the INT position to the backward binding site. Approximating d(−) = d(+), we obtain that PE = kFwd/(kFwd + kBwd) under F < 0 can still be written
in the form of eq 4.
Similarly, for the case that NL docking facilitates the forward motion
of the ADP head from the INT position to the forward binding site
on the MT, PE under F < 0 still has the form of eq 4.

From Figure 2, the
stepping ratio can be calculated with r = (PEkT)/[(1 – PE)kL]. Substituting eqs 1, 2, and 4 into the above expression, we obtain 5  

From eq 5, the stepping
ratio under no force or at F = 0 can be written as 6  

From Figure 2, the
motor’s velocity can be calculated with v =
[PEkT –
(1 – PE)kL]d. Substituting eqs 1 and 2 into the above
expression, we obtain 7  where d =
8.2 nm.

It is noted that, for kD ≫ k(+) ≫ k(−), eqs 5–7 become 8   9   10  

With eq 9, eq 8 can be written in another
form 11  where the stall force FS = log (r0)/(βd( + )). With eqs 4, 8, and 11, eq 10 can
be rewritten as 12  

As expected, eqs 9, 11, and 12 are identical
to those derived before.41,42 As shown before,41 these equations for the stepping ratio and velocity
are consistent with the numerical results of Monte Carlo simulations.

As shown before, with simpler eqs 11 and 12 and by adjusting the
values of four parameters, k(+), k(−), r0,
and FS, the available single-molecule
results about force dependencies of the stepping ratio and velocity
can be reproduced well.41,42 Alternatively, the
available single-molecule results can also be reproduced well with eqs 4, 8, and 10 and by adjusting values of the four
parameters k(+), k(−), ENL, and d(+). For example, by adjusting k(+) = 95 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, ENL = 3.34kBT, and d(+) = 3.5 nm, the theoretical results about the force dependence
of velocity (Figure 3a, green dashed line) are in good agreement with the single-molecule
results of Andreasson et al.17 for Drosophila kinesin. The sensitivity of the four fitting
parameters can be seen in Figure S1 (see
the Supporting Information). With the same values of k(+) = 95 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, and ENL = 3.34kBT as given above and adjusting d(+) =
3.95 nm, the theoretical results about the force dependence of the
stepping ratio (Figure 3b, green dashed line) are in good agreement with the single-molecule
results of Carter and Cross16 for Drosophila kinesin. Note that the slight difference in the
value of d(+) in Figure 3a,b could be due to different conditions
in the two experiments. For example, the characteristic distances
of the interaction between the head and MT tubulin along the MT filament
under different conditions could be slightly different, resulting
in the slight difference in the value of d(+).

MT-binding states with εs0 = 0.1 s–1. Symbols denote experimental data from Andreasson et al.17 (circles) and from Kunwar et al.22 (squares).

The single molecule results can also be reproduced well using more
precise eqs 4, 5, and 7 and with the five parameters k(+), k(−), ENL, d(+), and kD. As shown above, we still take k(+) = 95 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, and ENL = 3.34kBT for Drosophila kinesin (see Table 1). To be consistent with the biochemical
data of approximately 250 s–1 for the rate constant
of ADP release,51 we take kD = 250 s–1 (see Table 1). Then, by adjusting d(+) = 3.2 nm (see Table 1), the theoretical results about the force dependence of velocity
(Figure 3a, black solid
line) are in good agreement with the single-molecule results of Andreasson
et al.17 for Drosophila kinesin. Still with k(+) = 95 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, ENL = 3.34kBT, and kD = 250 s–1, by adjusting d(+) = 3.8 nm, the theoretical results about the force dependence
of the stepping ratio (Figure 3b, black solid line) are in good agreement with the single-molecule
results of Carter and Cross16 for Drosophila kinesin. As mentioned just above, the slight
difference in the value of d(+) in Figure 3a, b could be due
to different conditions in the two experiments.

Then, we focus
on squid optic lobe kinesin. With k(+) = 102 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, ENL = 4kBT, kD = 250 s–1, and d(+) = 3.1 nm (see Table 1), the theoretical results about the force dependence
of velocity (Figure 4a, black solid line) calculated using more precise eqs 4 and 7 are
in agreement with the single-molecule results of Schnitzer et al.33 The theoretical results about the force dependence
of the stepping ratio calculated using eq 5 are shown in Figure 4b (black solid line). For comparison, with k(+) = 102 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, ENL = 4kBT, and d(+) = 3.28 nm, the single-molecule
results of Schnitzer et al.33 can also
be reproduced by using simpler eqs 4 and 10 (Figure 4a, green dashed line). With k(+) = 102 s–1, k(−) = 3 s–1, ENL = 4kBT, and d(+) = 3.28 nm, the theoretical results about
the force dependence of the stepping ratio calculated by using simpler eq 8 (Figure 4b, green dashed line) are also close to those
calculated using more precise eq 5 and with parameter values given in Table 1.

3.2 Run Length
and Dissociation Rate When Dissociation
Only in the Weak MT-Binding State Is Considered
If the dissociation
cannot occur in the strong MT-binding state, based on the model (Figure 1), the dissociation
can only occur during two periods of the weak MT-binding state, periods
I and II. Period I occurs under the case that, in the INT state, ATP
hydrolysis and Pi release in the MT-bound head take place before the
weakening of the affinity between the two heads takes place (Figure 1f). Under no or a
backward load, the NL of the MT-bound head in the INT state before
NL docking is not in the forward orientation. Thus, the rate of ATP
hydrolysis and Pi release of the MT-bound head is equal to k(−) (see Section 2.2). Denoting by kNL the NL-docking rate of the MT-bound head under no load (which is
equal to the rate of the reduction of the affinity between the two
heads under any load) in the INT state, the probability of period
I occurring after ATP hydrolysis and Pi release in the trailing head
can be calculated with 13  

Under the forward
load with the magnitude larger than 2 pN, it is argued here that the
NL of the MT-bound head in the INT state before NL docking is driven
in the forward orientation that can enhance the rate of ATP hydrolysis
and Pi release of the head with the rate being equal to k(+) (see Section 2.2). As a result, the probability of period I occurring
after ATP hydrolysis and Pi release in the trailing head can be calculated
with 14  

Considering that period I cannot occur after ATP hydrolysis
and
Pi release in the leading head and with the trailing head in ATP state,
the occurrence rate of period I can then be calculated with 15  

Period II occurs under the following two cases. (i) ATP hydrolysis
and Pi release take place in the trailing head before ADP release
from the leading head (Figure 1g). (ii) ATP hydrolysis and Pi release take place in the leading
head before ADP release from the trailing head (Figure 1j). In one ATPase cycle, the occurrence probability
of case i can be calculated with PEk( + )/(k( + ) + kD), while the occurrence probability
of case ii can be calculated with (1 – PE)k( – )/(k( – ) + kD). Thus, the occurrence probability of period II in one ATPase
cycle can be calculated with 16  

The occurrence rate of period II can then be
calculated with 17  where k is
calculated with eq 3.

On the basis of Kramers theory, the dissociation rate in period
II can be approximately calculated with 18  where kw0 is the dissociation
rate in period II under no external
force and δw is the characteristic distance. Note
here that, in eq 18,
for simplicity but without loss of generality, it has been assumed
implicitly that the potential of the weak interaction between the
kinesin head and an MT-tubulin dimer is symmetric in the forward and
backward directions. Considering the lifetime of 1/kD for period II, the dissociation probability in period
II can then be calculated with 19  

Since Ew1 in period I is very small,
the motor is considered to be dissociated from the MT in period I
with a probability of PdI ≈ 1.
Thus, the dissociation rate during processive motion of the motor
when dissociation only in the weak MT-binding state is considered
can be calculated with εw = ωIPdI + ωIIPdII ≈ ωI + ωIIPdII which with eqs 15 and 17 can be rewritten
as 20  

The run length
can then be calculated with 21  

As it is seen above,
using eqs 1–4, 7, 13, 14, 16, and 18–21, we can calculate
the force-dependent dissociation rate and run
length where values of parameters k(+), k(−), ENL, d(+), kD, kNL, kw0, and δw are required. As shown in the above
section, values of parameters k(+), k(−), ENL, d(+), and kD have
been determined (see Table 1). Thus, only values of the remaining three parameters kNL, kw0, and δw are required to be determined.

First, we focus on Drosophila kinesin. With k(+), k(−), ENL, d(+), and kD given in Table 1 and by adjusting kNL = 1500 s–1, kw0 = 5 s–1, and δw = 2.2 nm (see Table 1), the theoretical
results about the dependence of the run length upon both backward
and forward forces (Figure 3c, dashed blue line) reproduce quantitatively the single-molecule
results of Andreasson et al.17 Note that
the value of kNL = 1500 s–1 taken here is consistent with the available experimental data.52 The sensitivity of the three fitting parameters
can be seen in Figure S2 (see the Supporting
Information). In particular, the dramatically asymmetric characteristic
of the run length with respect to the direction of the external force
is explained well. By comparison, in the previous theoretical and
numerical studies,33,34,53 although the dependence of the run length on the backward load can
be fitted, the dependence of the run length on the forward load has
not been explained. Our theoretical results about the dependence of
the dissociation rate upon both backward and forward forces (Figure 3d, dashed blue line)
are also in accordance with the single-molecule results of Andreasson
et al.17 (red circles) where the single-molecule
results of Andreasson et al.17 are obtained
by dividing data of velocity in Figure 3a by corresponding data of the run length in Figure 3c.

Then, we
focus on squid optic lobe kinesin. With k(+), k(−), ENL, d(+), and kD given in Table 1 and by adjusting kNL =
1500 s–1, kw0 = 5 s–1, and δw = 1.6 nm (see Table 1), the theoretical results about
the dependence of the run length upon backward force (Figure 4c, dashed blue line) reproduce
well the single-molecule results of Schnitzer et al.33 As for the case of Drosophila kinesin,
the theoretical results predict that the run length of squid optic
lobe kinesin is also dramatically asymmetric with respect to the direction
of the external force. The theoretical results about the force dependence
of the dissociation rate (Figure 4d, dashed blue line) are also in agreement with the
single-molecule results of Schnitzer et al.33 where the single molecule data are obtained by dividing data of
velocity in Figure 4a by corresponding data of the run length in Figure 4c. Both the experimental and theoretical
results show that in the range of approximately 0 < F < 4 pN, the dissociation rate increases almost exponentially
as the backward force increases, and in the range of approximately
5 < F < 7 pN, the dissociation rate decreases
as the backward force increases.

3.3 Run Length
and Dissociation Rate When Dissociations
in Both the Weak and Strong MT-Binding States Are Considered
In the above section, we have not considered the dissociation of
the motor in the strong MT-binding state, which is approximately applicable
to the case of small magnitudes of the external force. However, when
the external force has a large magnitude, the dissociation of the
dimer in the strong MT-binding state must be taken into account. Thus,
in this section, we consider the dissociation in both the weak MT-binding
state, as studied in the above section, and strong MT-binding state.

During the processive motion of the kinesin dimer, the periods
of the weak MT-binding state, including periods I and II, can only
occur occasionally in one chemomechanical coupling cycle, and if they
occur, they only make up a small percent of the whole period of the
chemomechanical coupling cycle. That is, during the processive motion,
the kinesin motor is nearly always in the strong MT-binding state.
Thus, on the basis of Kramers theory, the dissociation rate of the
motor when dissociation only in the strong MT-binding state is considered
can be approximately calculated with 22  where εs0 is the dissociation rate under F = 0 and
δs is the interaction distance. Here, it was also
implicitly
assumed that the potential of the strong interaction between the kinesin
head and MT-tubulin dimer is symmetric in the forward and backward
directions. It is noted that the potential of the kinesin head in
the strong MT-binding state could have a different form from that
in the weak MT-binding state, and thus δs could have
a value different from δw.

The total rate of
dissociation of the motor during its processive
motion can be calculated with 23  

The run length can then be calculated
with 24  

From eqs 22–24, it is seen that two additional parameters εs0 and δs are required to calculate the dissociation
rate and run length when the dissociations occurring at both the weak
and strong MT-binding states are considered. To be consistent with
the measured dissociation rate of approximately 45 s–1 under very large backward force of F = 25 pN by
Andreasson et al.,17 from eqs 22 and 23,
we see that only one parameter, for example, εs0 is
adjustable, while the other parameter δs can be determined.
Here, we take two values of εs0 for the calculations.

In the main text, we take εs0 = 0.1 s–1. Then, with values of other parameters given in Table 1, we calculate the force-dependent
run length when dissociations in both the weak and strong MT-binding
states are considered with the results being shown in Figures 3c and 4c (black solid lines) for Drosophila and squid optic lobe kinesin motors, respectively. As expected,
the inclusion of the dissociation that can occur in the strong MT-binding
state has only a slight effect on the run length in the range of F < 9 pN. The theoretical results of the run length versus
external force when dissociations in both the weak and strong MT-binding
states are considered are also in quantitative agreement with the
available experimental results.

With inclusion of the dissociation
that can occur in the strong
MT-binding state, the theoretical results of the dissociation rate
upon the external force (black solid lines) are shown in Figures 3d and 4d for Drosophila and
squid optic lobe kinesin motors, respectively. From Figure 3d, it is seen that the theoretical
results are consistent with both the single-molecule results of Andreasson
et al.17 and those of Kunwar et al.22Figure 4d shows that the theoretical results are also consistent with
the single-molecule results of Schnitzer et al.33 The theoretical results in both Figures 3d and 4d show the slip–catch–slip bond behavior for
the interaction between kinesin and MTs during the processive motion
of the motor on MTs under the backward external force, as indicated
by experimental evidence22 and used in
a lot of works to study the cooperative transports by multiple kinesin
and/or dynein molecular motors.22,28−30 In the range of a small backward force (approximately 0 < F < 4 pN), as the backward force increases, the dissociation
rate increases almost exponentially. After reaching the maximum, the
dissociation rate decreases as the backward force increases further.
After reaching the minimum, the dissociation rate increases again
as the backward force increases further. By comparison, in the previous
theoretical and numerical studies,33,34,53 the slip–catch–slip bond behavior for
the dissociation rate under the backward has not been explained.

In the Supporting Information (Figures S3 and S4), we take εs0 = 0.01 s–1. With values of other parameters given in Table 1, the theoretical results about the force
dependencies of the run length and dissociation rate for Drosophila and squid optic lobe kinesin motors are shown in Figures S3 and S4, respectively. It can be seen that the theoretical
results also agree well with the available single-molecule results,
and the dissociate rate versus F (>0) also shows
the slip–catch–slip bond behavior.

4 Concluding Remarks
Analytical theory on dynamics of kinesin
molecular motors under
both forward and backward external forces reproduces quantitatively
the previous single-molecule results about force dependencies of the
velocity, stepping ratio, run length, dissociation rate, etc. Particularly,
the dramatic asymmetry of the run length with respect to the direction
of the external force is well explained. Moreover, the theory shows
that under the backward force, the dissociation rate of the motor
during its processive motion exhibits the slip–catch–slip
bond behavior with the dissociation rate increasing first with the
backward force then decreasing with the backward force and then increasing
again with the backward force.

Finally, it is mentioned that,
in the main text, we only present
the analytical studies at saturating ATP. The approximate analytical
studies at nonsaturating ATP are presented in the Supporting Information
(see Sections S1–S6 and Figures S5–S8). The theoretical results about the force dependencies of the velocity,
stepping ratio, and dwell time at different ATP concentrations are
also in quantitative agreement with the available single-molecule
results (Figure S6). The theoretical results
show that if the dissociation can only occur in the weak MT-binding
state, the run length is nearly independent on ATP concentration and
the dependence of the run length on the ATP concentration arises almost
solely from the dissociation in the strong MT-binding state (Figure S7). For the case of εw ≫ εs, for example, under a low forward force
(see Figures 3d and 4d), the change of ATP concentration has only a slight
effect on the run length (Figure S7), consistent
with the single-molecule results of Andreasson et al.17 By contrast, for the case of εw comparable
to or smaller than εs, for example, under no or a
backward force (see Figures 3d and 4d), the change of ATP concentration
has a large effect on the run length (Figures S7 and S8), consistent with the single-molecule results of
Schnitzer et al.33
