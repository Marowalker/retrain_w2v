1-Methoxy-8-(diphenylphosphino)triptycene
(1), featuring
high structural rigidity and steric bulkiness around the phosphine
functionality, was synthesized as a new chiral monophosphine ligand
for transition metal-catalyzed reactions. In the presence of 5–10
mol ppm (i.e., 0.0005–0.001 mol %) Pd(OAc)2 and 1 (2 equiv for Pd), Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions
of aryl bromides and arylboronic acids proceeded effectively under
mild atmospheric conditions to give the corresponding biaryl compounds
in a high yield. The single-crystal X-ray analysis of a Pd(II) complex
of 1 revealed its coordination structure, in which two
homochiral molecules form a dimer, suggesting that triptycene could
provide a chiral environment for asymmetric organic transformations.
In fact, optically active 1 obtained by optical resolution
showed good enantioselectivity in the palladium-catalyzed asymmetric
hydrosilylation of styrene, which represents, for the first time,
the asymmetric catalytic activity of triptycene-based monophosphine
ligands.

Introduction
Triptycene is a propeller-shaped
molecule composed of three 120°-oriented
phenylene blades (Figure 1a).1 Along with this high molecular
symmetry, triptycene provides a large free volume around the aromatic
skeleton. These structural features of triptycene have inspired chemists
to develop organic,2−4 polymeric,5 and supramolecular6,7 functional materials, which have mainly focused on the use of the
free volume in terms of host–guest chemistry. For this purpose,
a large number of triptycene derivatives with functional groups at
the metapositions of the bridgehead carbons (e.g., 2-, 3-, 6-, 7-,
14-, and 15-positions) have been synthesized. Meanwhile, regiospecific
functionalization of triptycene at the three ortho positions (i.e.,
1-, 8-, 13- or 4-, 5-, 16-positions) of the bridgehead carbon can
force the attached functional groups to assemble in proximity to each
other at a distance of approximately 4.5 Å (Figure 1b). Although this type of triptycene
is relatively rare, its stereochemistry would be useful in the design
of ligands for transition metal catalysis.8,9

geometrical models.

To date, several 1,8-substituted
triptycene-based bisphosphine
ligands have been developed, so as to take advantage of the particular
bite angle and geometry of chelation.8 In
this context, 1,8-substituted triptycene-based monophosphine ligands
should also be interesting because sterically bulky and rigid monodentate
ligands generally show a high catalytic activity for various transition
metal-catalyzed reactions.10 Furthermore,
when different functional groups are incorporated into these positions,
the resultant substituted triptycene should become chiral (Figure 1c). However, to the
best of our knowledge, only one previous report has described the
synthesis of a triptycene-based chiral monophosphine ligand, and the
catalytic activity of its transition metal complex has not been investigated.9 Here, we report the synthesis of 1-methoxy-8-(diphenylphosphino)triptycene
(1, Figure 1c, Scheme 1) as a
prototype of a triptycene-based chiral monophosphine ligand. Using
Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling and asymmetric hydrosilylation
as model reactions, we demonstrate for the first time the catalytic
activity of a monophosphine consisting of a sterically bulky and structurally
rigid triptycene scaffold.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of 1-Methoxy-8-(diphenylphosphino)triptycene (1)
In the light of the structures of axially chiral
monodentate phosphine (MOP) ligands11 and
a simple geometrical model (Figure 1d), we designed monophosphine ligand 1 (Figure 1c), which
was successfully synthesized from 1,8-dihydroxytriptycene (2)13 using procedures similar to those
for MOP ligands11,12 (Scheme 1). Thus, compound 2 was reacted
with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (4.0 equiv) in 1,2-dichloroethane
at 60 °C in the presence of pyridine (8.0 equiv) to give 1,8-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy)triptycene
(3) in 75% yield. Monophosphinylated triptycene 4 was obtained as a racemic mixture in 90% yield through the
reaction of 3 with diphenylphosphine oxide (2.0 equiv)
in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (5.0 mol %) and 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphono)butane
(5.0 mol %) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 °C. Upon treatment
with NaOH, the triflate group of 4 was converted into
a hydroxy group, which was subjected to methylation with MeI (2.9
equiv) in the presence of K2CO3 (2.9 equiv)
to give 6 in 89% yield (two steps). The phosphine oxide
group of 6 was reduced by HSiCl3 in the presence
of triethylamine in toluene at 120 °C, to allow the isolation
of 1 in 90% yield. All compounds were unambiguously characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, infrared (IR)
spectroscopy, and high-resolution atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
time-of-flight (APCI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Figures S5–S16).

Many attempts to achieve the optical
resolution of 1 using chiral high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) under various conditions were not successful.
Instead, we found that chiral HPLC (CHIRAL ART Amylose-SA column,
CHCl3/hexane = 1/2 v/v) of 6 (the precursor
of 1) gave rise to well-separated fractions from which
enantiomers of 6 (Figure 2a) were isolated. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra
of the enantiomers were complete mirror images (Figure 2b); hereafter, each enantiomer of 6 is expressed as 6CD(+) or 6CD(−) based on the sign of
the CD signal at 300 nm. As in the case of racemic 6,
reduction of optically active 6, for example, 6CD(+), with HSiCl3 gave optically
active 1CD(+), which displayed
clear CD peaks (Figure S1).

Pd-Catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
Cross-Coupling Using Racemic 1
With racemic 1, we examined the catalytic
activity of the triptycene-based monophosphine ligand for Pd-catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (Table 1). As a typical example, when p-bromotoluene (7a, 1.0 mmol) was reacted with phenylboronic
acid (8a, 1.25 mmol) in 2-methoxyethanol for 2 h at 60
°C under aerobic conditions in the presence of 1.0 mol % Pd(OAc)2, 2.0 mol % 1, and K3PO4 (2.0 mmol), 4-methyldiphenyl (9a) was isolated in 99%
yield (entry 1, Table 1). We investigated the effects of the solvent (Table S1), base (Table S3), and
Pd source (Table S2) on the cross-coupling
of 7a and 8a with 1.0 mol % PdCl2, 2.0 mol % 1, and K3PO4 (2.0
mmol). The cross-coupling reaction in 2-methoxyethanol or a mixture
of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O (1/1 in vol) led to the highest
yield of 9a (99%, entries 4 and 13, Table S1), whereas that in methanol or isopropyl alcohol resulted
in 9a in less than 10% yield. Among the various bases
examined, the use of K3PO4, in combination with
2-methoxyethanol, gave the best result (entry 1, Table S3). For the Pd(II) source, PdCl2 and Pd(OAc)2 allowed the quantitative conversion of 7a and 8a into 9a (entries 1 and 4, Table S2), whereas the use of PdCl2(PPh3)2 or Pd2(dibenzylideneacetone)3 under identical conditions lowered the yield of 9a (entries
2 and 3, Table S2). Based on the above
experimental results, we set 2-methoxyethanol, K3PO4, and Pd(OAc)2 as the standard combination for
Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling with 1.

Remarkably, the use of only
0.001 mol % (i.e., 10 mol ppm) Pd(OAc)2 and 1 (2 equiv for Pd) could achieve the quantitative
formation of 9a from 7a and 8a (entry 2, Table 1), which indicates that the turnover number (TON) of the catalytic
system is as high as 99 000. An even higher TON (108 000)
was obtained when the cross-coupling was performed with a 5 mol ppm
Pd loading, though the yield of 9a decreased to 54% (entry
3, Table 1). In sharp
contrast, when the cross-coupling reaction was conducted using Pd(OAc)2 alone (10 mol ppm of Pd loading), 9a was obtained
in only 15% yield (entry 4, Table 1). In the presence of PPh3 (2 equiv for
Pd), the yield of 9a was increased to some extent (35%;
entry 5, Table 1).
When a sterically bulky phosphine ligand such as (2-biphenylyl)diphenylphosphine
was used (2 equiv for Pd) in place of PPh3, the yield of 9a was greatly improved (70%; entry 6, Table 1), yet it was lower than that achieved in
the cross-coupling reaction with Pd(OAc)2/1. Therefore, we consider that a synergetic effect, arising from the
steric bulkiness around the phosphine group and the rigidity of the
triptycene scaffold, would lead to the excellent catalytic activity
of 1.10

Substrate Scope
of Pd(OAc)2/1 Catalyst
for Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling
Table 2 shows the substrate scope of
the catalytic system of Pd(OAc)2/1 for the
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of various aryl bromides (7b–7j, 1.0 mmol) and phenylboronic acid (8a, 1.25 mmol) with Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol ppm), 1 (20 mol ppm), and K3PO4 (2.0 mmol) in 2-methoxyethanol
under aerobic conditions. Biaryl products 9b–9e were formed quantitatively (99% yield) from aryl bromides 7b–7e with an electron-withdrawing substituent such
as NO2, CF3, COMe, or CHO (entries 1–4).
On the other hand, the efficiency of the cross-coupling between 8a and aryl bromides 7f–7h containing
an electron-donating substituent (NH2, p-OMe, m-OMe, or o-OMe) was slightly
decreased, giving rise to biaryls 9f–9h in 80–85%
yield (entries 5–7). Notably, when 7i and 7j bearing relatively sterically demanding o-OMe and o-CH3 substituents, respectively,
were subjected to Pd(OAc)2/1-catalyzed cross-coupling,
the corresponding products were obtained in good yields (9i: 85% and 9j: 93%, entries 8 and 9). Meanwhile, the
cross-coupling of p-chlorotoluene with 8a did not proceed under the reaction conditions, resulting in complete
recovery of the starting materials.

As summarized in Table 3, we further examined Pd(OAc)2/1-catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling using aryl bromides (7b, 7d, and 7g) and substituted phenylboronic
acids (8b–8d). Under conditions identical to those
described in Table 2, the cross-coupling of electron-deficient aryl bromides (7b and 7d) with 8b bearing an electron-withdrawing
CF3 group gave the corresponding biaryls in high yields
(86–99%, entries 1 and 2). A similar result was obtained when
electron-rich arylboronic acid 8c was used in place of 8b (entries 3 and 4). As represented by entries 5 and 6, the
catalytic system of Pd(OAc)2/1 worked very
efficiently for cross-coupling even with sterically demanding o-methylphenylboronic acid (8d). Meanwhile,
for electron-rich aryl bromides such as 7g, to achieve
a satisfactory yield of biaryl products, the reaction should be conducted
with a larger amount of the Pd source, for example, 50 mol ppm of
Pd(OAc)2 (entry 7) or in the presence of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (entries 8 and 9), which is a promising
additive for improving Pd-catalyzed reactions.14

Single-Crystal X-ray Structural Analysis of a Pd Complex with
Racemic 1
To gain insight into the structure
of the catalytic species, we attempted to crystallize a Pd/1 complex directly from a mixture of Pd(OAc)2 and racemic 1. Although this attempt was not successful, a dark orange-colored
block-shaped single crystal suitable for X-ray crystallography was
obtained when a 1:1 mixture of Pd(OAc)2 and 1 was treated with NaBr and recrystallized from a mixture of CH2Cl2 and diethyl ether (see the Supporting Information).15 The
X-ray diffraction analysis of the single crystal revealed the formation
of a dimer of PdBr2/1 (10), where
Pd atoms are bridged by μ-Br atoms (Figure 3). The dimer formation is in contrast to
the case of a previously reported mononuclear PdCl2 complex
of chiral 1-p-tolylthio-8-(diphenylphosphino)triptycene,9 where the PdCl2(II) is simply ligated
with the P atom of the triptycene and a THF molecule without forming
such a dimeric structure. In the crystal structure of 10, the phosphorous atoms of 1 bind to Pd with interatomic
Pd–P distances of 2.2493(12) and 2.2456(12) Å (Figure 3).16 Notably, although 1 exists as a racemic mixture
in the unit cell (space group = P21/c, Z = 4), each molecule of PdBr2/1 is composed of homochiral 1. This structural
feature suggests that 1 could provide a chiral environment
around the coordination sphere of Pd for asymmetric organic transformations.

clarity. Selected bond distances (Å) and angles (deg): P(2)–O(2)
= 4.495(4), P(1)–O(1) = 4.424(4), P(2)–Pd(2) = 2.2493(12),
P(1)–Pd(1) = 2.2456(12), Pd(1)–O(1) = 3.446(4), Pd(2)–O(2)
= 4.580(4), P(2)–Pd(2)–Br(3) = 93.6(4), and P(1)–Pd(1)–Br(3)
= 93.6(4).

For reference, we tested the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling
of 7a and 8a using complex 10 (10 mol ppm) as a catalyst under otherwise identical conditions
to those in Table 1. As shown in Scheme S1, the coupling
reaction took place very efficiently to give 9a in 95%
yield. Given that the 1:1 complex of PdBr2 and 1 (10) exhibits an excellent catalytic activity, a 1:1
complex of other Pd source and 1 would be the active
species in the catalytic system for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling.

Pd-Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions Using Optically Active 1CD(+)
Because of the limited
variation in the chiral MOP ligands in comparison with the large variation
in bidentate phosphine ligands, 1 seemed to be promising
as a new candidate for the chiral MOP ligand. First, we conducted
the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 1-bromo-2-methylnaphthalene
(7k) or 1-bromo-2-methoxynaphthalene (7l) with 2-methylphenylboronic acid (8d) in the presence
of optically active 1CD(+) (Scheme 2).17 Although these reactions showed high or moderate yields
(9t: 86% and 9u: 63%), no enantiomeric excesses
(ee) of these products were observed (Figures S2 and S3).

The ee values were
determined by HPLC
(CHIRALCEL OD-H with n-hexane, see the Supporting Information).

Next, we conducted a Pd-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction11,18 by using 1CD(+) as a chiral
ligand (Scheme 3).
Styrene was reacted with HSiCl3 in the presence of [PdCl(π-allyl)]2 (0.25 mol %) and 1CD(+) (0.60 mol %) in toluene at 25 °C to give 11 in
52% isolated yield. The Tamao oxidation of 11 using H2O2, KF, and KHCO3 afforded an optically
active 1-phenylethanol (12), whose ee value was determined
to be 58% with R configuration (Figure S4). Although the enantioselectivity was moderate in
this reaction, this result clearly indicated that 1CD(+) could serve as a chiral monophosphine ligand.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, inspired by a geometrical model (Figure 1d), we designed a triptycene-based
monophosphine ligand, 1-methoxy-8-(diphenylphosphino)triptycene (1), for the development of a new catalytic system for transition
metal-catalyzed organic transformation. Surprisingly, there has been
no previous report on the catalytic application of a triptycene of
this type. Compound 1 was obtained in a manner similar
to the synthesis of well-known MOP.11,12 Using Pd-catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, we demonstrated the catalytic
activity of 1 complexed with Pd(II). The catalytic system
worked efficiently for cross-coupling reactions between a wide variety
of aryl bromides and arylboronic acids and gave the corresponding
biaryls in good to excellent yields (80–99%), even when the
Pd loading was as low as 0.001 mol %. The successful chiral HPLC separation
of the precursor of 1 allowed the synthesis of optically
active 1. Although this chiral ligand was unable to induce
chirality in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, it was applicable
to a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction. The ee of the
product was moderate (58% ee), but this was surprising considering
the rather simple stereochemistry of 1, which may be
described as a triangle with three different poles at the
apexes (Figure 1d). These results show the potential of this triptycene-based monophosphine
ligand with structural rigidity and steric bulkiness around the phosphine
group. Thus, proper modifications of this prototype, in terms of the
triptycene skeleton itself and substituents of phosphine and alkoxy
groups, might lead to new highly efficient catalytic systems to give
a particular stereoselectivity.

At 25 °C, triflic anhydride (3.0 mL,
