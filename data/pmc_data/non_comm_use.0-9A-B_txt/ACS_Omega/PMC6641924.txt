Alminoprofen, (RS)-2-{4-[(2-methylprop-2-en-1-yl)amino]phenyl}propanoic
acid (ALP) 1, is a racemic drug categorized as a 2-arylpropanoic
acid-class nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Pharmacokinetic studies
of 1 in patients have revealed that the corresponding
acyl glucuronide 5 is a major urinary metabolite, but
little is known about the structure and stereochemistry of 5. The present work describes the synthesis of a diastereomeric mixture
of 1-β-O-acyl glucuronides (2RS)-5 from 1 and methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromo-1-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranuronate 2 using our chemo-enzymatic method that has complete specificity
for the β-configuration. The structure of (2RS)-5 was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well
as by complete hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase. The absolute stereochemistry
of (2RS)-5 was determined by comparison
with (2R)-5 synthesized alternatively
from (2R)-1 and 2. Compound
(2R)-1 was prepared in two steps starting
from chiral (R)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)propanoic acid (2R)-6. Chiral resolution of (2RS)-1 was achieved using a chiral high-performance liquid
chromatography column, and its stereochemistry was determined by comparison
with (2R)-1. The intrinsic degradation
rate constant of (2R)-5 was 0.405 ±
0.002 h–1, which is approximately twice that of
(2S)-5 (the k value
was 0.226 ± 0.002 h–1) under physiological
conditions (pH 7.40, 37 °C).

==== Body
Introduction
Glucuronidation of
carboxylic acid drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) is a major conjugation reaction catalyzed by multiple
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).1−5 The resultant 1-β-O-acyl glucuronides (AGs)
are of great importance not only in drug metabolism and excretion
but also because of their toxicological consequences. AGs are chemically
reactive, electrophilic metabolites that undergo degradation reactions
(hydrolysis and intramolecular migration of the 1-β-O-acyl linkage)6,7 as well as covalent
binding to cellular macromolecules and thus may be implicated in adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) such as drug-induced liver injury8−15 and intestinal injury.16−18 Some NSAIDs have been withdrawn
from the market because of ADRs, including liver and renal toxicities
and anaphylaxis.8,19−21 Since a pioneering
study on the excellent correlation between the extents of covalent
binding of AGs to albumin and their degradation rate constants,22 there have been several thorough studies on
the structure–rate constant relationships of AGs as well as
prediction and evaluation studies of the toxicological risks posed
by AGs.23−29 The mechanism of the covalent binding of AGs to and the binding
sites on albumin have been reported,30−33 and the modification of albumin
has been demonstrated to proceed via both the direct acylation34 and the Schiff base-mediated glycation35 mechanisms. Recently, AG-mediated cytotoxic
mechanisms involving oxidative stress have been reported.36,37 In addition, AGs play roles in drug–drug interactions via
membrane transporters17,38,39 as well as through CYP2C8 inhibition.40−42 Various factors that
affect the safety of AGs, including the rates of formation, elimination,
and aglucuronidation; their intrinsic reactivity; and the potential
proteins being targeted,43 as well as the
molecular mechanisms underlying AG-induced toxicities,44 all remain to be elucidated fully.

ALP,
(RS)-2-{4-[(2-methylallyl)amino]phenyl}propanoic
acid 1 (Figure 1), is a racemic drug categorized as a 2-arylpropanoic acid-class
NSAID and has the distinctive molecular characteristic of possessing
a 4-monoalkenylamino group in a structure that closely resembles that
of ibuprofen. The drug 1 has been used in several countries
such as France, Luxembourg, and Japan; in Japan, 1 was
approved in 2014 as a switch OTC commonly used to treat conditions
such as rheumatism, arthralgia, and lumbago. The drug 1 is reported to exhibit a more potent analgesic effect than ibuprofen45 and to exert a dual anti-inflammatory action
by inhibiting both cyclo-oxygenase-2 and phospholipase A2,46,47 thereby possibly causing interesting analgesic,
antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory actions46,48−50 different from those of commonly used NSAIDs. Pharmacokinetic
studies in patients after p.o. administration of 1 have
revealed rapid absorption, a short time to maximum plasma level, a
short biological half-life, and excretion of the corresponding ALP
acyl glucuronide 5 as a major urinary metabolite.51 The acyl glucuronide 5 is most
likely the diastereomers (2RS)-5 derived
from 1, but little is known about the structure and stereochemistry
of 5. Furthermore, the membrane transporter(s) for 1 and (2RS)-5, the UGT isozyme(s)
involved in glucuronidation, and the possible stereoselectivities
of these biological systems toward 1 (enantioselective)
and (2RS)-5 (diastereoselective) all
remain to be elucidated. However, 1 has been reported
to show high permeability comparable to that of ibuprofen in Caco-2
cell studies.52,53 The synthesis and stereochemical
determination of (2RS)-5, as well as
the chiral resolution of 1, are thus of great importance
in pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies of 1.

Figure 1 Structure of
ALP 1.

Herein, we report the
synthesis of (2RS)-5 from 1 using our chemo-enzymatic method,54 the
stereochemistry of both (2RS)-5 and 1, and the intrinsic degradation
rate constants of (2R)-5 and (2S)-5 under physiological conditions (at pH
7.40 and 37 °C).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of ALP AGs (2RS)-5
Two diastereomeric mixtures
of (2RS)-5 were synthesized using our
two-step chemo-enzymatic method,54,55 as shown in Scheme 1. In the first step,
condensation of the cesium salt of 1 with methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromo-1-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranuronate 2 afforded the corresponding
methyl acetyl derivatives (2RS)-3 as
an approximately 1:1 mixture of the diastereomers in a modest 53%
yield, without production of the corresponding α-anomers (based
on 1H NMR data). The anomeric β-configurations of
the diastereomers (2RS)-3 were confirmed
by 1H NMR. The J values of both anomeric
protons were 8.2 Hz,56 and the chemical
shifts were δ 5.85 and 5.78 for (2S)-3 and (2R)-3, respectively.
We were unable to separate the diastereomers (2RS)-3 using conventional methods, and thus we examined
enzymatic removal of the sugar-protecting groups as the next step
toward (2RS)-3. It is important to remove
the protecting groups without affecting the 1-β-O-acyl linkage. As shown in Table 1, (2RS)-3 was not detected
following treatment with lipase AS Amano (LAS) at the optimal temperature
of 40 °C for 1.33 h of incubation, and the products and yields
(%) were the partially O-deacetylated intermediates
(48%), the fully O-deacetylated derivatives (2RS)-4 (43%), and the liberated parent carboxylic
acid 1 (9%). The chemo-selectivity of LAS toward the O-acetyl groups was not improved by using cosolvents (1,4-dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, and MeOH) other
than dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (data not shown). In contrast, the
use of carboxylesterase from Streptomyces rochei (CSR) at the optimal temperature of 50 °C for 1.33 h resulted
in 16% unreacted (2RS)-3; the products
were fully O-deacetylated derivatives (2RS)-4 (64%) and intermediates (20%). No liberation of
the parent carboxylic acid 1 was detected, indicating
that CSR exhibited much higher chemo-selectivity toward the O-acetyl groups than did LAS. Furthermore, CSR exhibited
higher hydrolytic activity toward the partially O-deacetylated intermediates than toward (2RS)-3, whereas LAS exhibited the opposite preference for the substrates.
Therefore, concurrent use of LAS and CSR (1:10, w/w) synergistically
accelerated O-deacetylation to afford (2RS)-4 in 94% yield in 7 h and a small amount of 1 (3%). To diminish the liberation of 1 catalyzed
by LAS, the initial reaction temperature of 40 °C was maintained
for 0.25 h and then was raised to 50 °C to deactivate the hydrolytic
activity of LAS. As was reported previously,54,55 DMSO was proved to be a good choice of cosolvent for the enzymatic
deacetylation of the O-acetyl groups of (2RS)-3.

As the final
step, enzymatic chemo-selective hydrolysis of the
methyl ester of (2RS)-4 was examined
using pig liver esterase (PLE), lipase type-B from Candida antarctica (CALB), and Chirazymes L-5 CA
and L-2 CB, using DMSO as a cosolvent. As shown in Table 2, Chirazyme L-5 CA showed the
lowest hydrolytic activity toward (2RS)-4. PLE showed a high hydrolytic activity comparable with those of
CALB and Chirazyme L-2 CB but lower chemo-selectivity; the parent
carboxylic acid 1 (3%) was concomitantly liberated. DMSO
was the best cosolvent for these enzymatic reactions: in the PLE-catalyzed
reaction, the amount of 1 increased to 14% when MeOH
was used as the cosolvent while keeping all other conditions unchanged
and the hydrolytic activity of PLE was almost inhibited when tert-BuOH was used as the cosolvent (data not shown).

Both CALB and
Chirazyme L-2 CB yielded (2RS)-5 efficiently
and quantitatively, with both the enzymes showing
extremely high chemo-selectivity toward the methyl ester group of
(2RS)-4 without affecting the 1-β-O-acyl linkage. Chirazyme L-2 CB, whose specific activity
is approximately one-half that of CALB, might be more a convenient
enzyme than CALB: a CALB-derived impurity coelutes with the product
(2RS)-5 in the Amberlite XAD-4 column
chromatography purification step, although this impurity can be removed
prior to use of CALB as the enzymatic catalyst by adsorption onto
XAD-4 resin (cf. Experimental Section).

The purity of (2RS)-5 as AG was assayed
by 1H NMR and HPLC analyses. The anomeric β-configurations
of the diastereomers (2RS)-5 were confirmed
by 1H NMR: the J values of both anomeric
protons of the (2S)- and (2R)-5 diastereomers were 8.2 Hz,56 representative
values for their β-configurations. HPLC analyses using an L-column2
ODS revealed that two peaks, corresponding to diastereomeric (2RS)-5 (peaks a and b in Figure 2A), were quantitatively hydrolyzed to the
parent ALP 1 following treatment with β-glucuronidase
at 37 °C for 20 min (peak c in Figure 2B). The purity of (2RS)-5 as AG was calculated to be over 99% (data not shown).

pH 5.0 and 37 °C, and the synthesized (2R)-5 (peak d in C) whose retention time was consistent with that
of peak b in A.

Synthesis of (2R)-1 and Its AGs
(2R)-5
We synthesized (2R)-5 from (2R)-1 and 2 to determine the absolute configuration at the
chiral center α to the 1-β-O-acyl linkage
of (2RS)-5. Compound (2R)-1 was prepared in two steps starting from (RS)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)propanoic acid (2RS)-6, as shown in Scheme 2. Chiral resolution of (2RS)-6 was achieved using a diastereomeric salt method.57 The racemate (2RS)-6 in ethyl acetate solution was treated with (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine
to precipitate the (2R)-6-derived diastereomeric
salt; after four recrystallizations, (2R)-6 with 95.3% ee was obtained. The R configuration
was confirmed by optical rotation measurements. Catalytic hydrogenation
of (2R)-6 to the corresponding amine
(2R)-7 followed by N-alkenylation58 using excess amounts of
3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene and potassium fluoride on Celite afforded
(2R)-1 with 95.4% ee. The chiral (2R)-5 was synthesized from (2R)-1 and 2 according to the methods shown
in Scheme 1. Figure 2C shows a typical
reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram of (2R)-5 (peak d); the retention time of this peak was consistent with that
of peak b in Figure 2A.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of (2R)-ALP (2R)-1
Reagents: (a) (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine, EtOAc, four recrystallizations (55%,
95.3% ee); (b) H2–Pd/C, MeOH, 4 h (92%); and (c)
3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene, KF on Celite, CH3CN, 70 °C,
12 h (44%).

Chiral Resolution of ALP 1
Methods for
the chiral resolution of several NSAIDs have been reviewed.59 To our knowledge, though, there is no published
stereospecific assays for 1 other than one paper in a
Japanese journal60 that reported the pharmacological
activities of the d- and l-isomers of 1. However, that paper did not describe the synthesis and structural
characteristics of these isomers. We, therefore, attempted the chiral
resolution of 1 and compared the retention times of the
enantiomers with that of the synthesized (2R)-1 (Scheme 2). The enantiomers of 1 were well-separated from each
other using a semipreparative CHIRALCEL OZ-H chiral HPLC column, and
the comparison of the retention times was conducted using a CHIRALPAK
IG analytical column. As shown in Figure 3, the retention time of (2R)-1 (peak c in Figure 3B) was consistent with that of the peak a in Figure 3A.

Figure 3 Chiral HPLC chromatograms
of 1 (peaks a and b in A)
and (2R)-1 (peak c in B). The retention
times of the major peak c corresponding to (2R)-1 and the minor peak d were consistent with those of peaks
a and b in A, respectively.

Kinetic Studies on the Degradation Reaction of (2RS)-5
As was reported previously,25 degradation rate constant (k) values of AGs in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) at 37
°C have been demonstrated to consist of rate constants of intramolecular
acyl migration and hydrolysis of their 1-β-O-acyl linkages. Because both the reactions are electrophilic ones,
the more the k value increases, the higher the electrophilic
reactivity of the corresponding AG becomes. Therefore, to estimate
the electrophilic reactivity of (2RS)-5, their k values were determined by incubating (2RS)-5 in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH
7.4) at 37 °C and analyzing changes with time by HPLC. As shown
in Figure 4, the decreases
in the concentrations of both (2R)-5 and (2S)-5 obeyed pseudo-first-order
reaction kinetics in the time range spanning 3 or 4 half-lives. The
major products were the corresponding intramolecular acyl-migrated
isomers; the released ALP 1 was only 9% after 7 h (data
not shown). The k value of (2R)-5 was 0.405 ± 0.002 h–1 (the half-life
was 1.71 h), which is approximately twice that of (2S)-5 (the k value and the half-life
were 0.226 ± 0.002 h–1 and 3.07 h, respectively).
This result is in accordance with earlier reports that the (R)/(S) ratios of the k values for several 2-arylpropanoic acid-derived AGs are around 2.61 These k values for (2R)- and (2S)-5 are smaller
than those of AGs derived from (2R)- and (2S)-phenylpropanoic acids, whose values were previously determined
to be 0.604 ± 0.003 and 0.324 ± 0.008 h–1, respectively, under the same conditions and methods.62 The lower reactivity of (2R)- and (2S)-5 might be due partly to
the electronic effect23,63 of the electron-donating (2-methylallyl)amino
substituent on (2R)- and (2S)-5; the Hammett substituent constant σp of
this substituent is not found in the literature but estimated to be
a negative value, judging from the σp values64 of EtNH– and CH3(CH2)3NH– substituents being −0.61 and −0.51,
respectively. Although there is no report for the Hammett reaction
constant ρ value for AGs derived from m- and p-substituted (2RS)-phenylpropanoic acid
derivatives and hence the theoretical k values of
(2R)- and (2S)-5 cannot
be calculated, the theoretical k values can be predicted
to be lower than those of AGs derived from (2R)-
and (2S)-phenylpropanoic acids based on the estimated
ρ value being positive.62 Therefore,
we next tried to calculate the k value of (2R)-5, based on the previously reported25 linear relationship between log k of AGs and δCOOH values of the
parent carboxylic acids, a good positive correlation with a slope
of 0.79. From the δCOOH values (12.04
and 12.33 ppm for ALP 1 and 2-phenylpropanoic acid, respectively)
and a log k value of −0.219 for AG derived
from (2R)-phenylpropanoic acid,62 the k value for (2R)-5 was calculated to be 0.356, the value being close to the
measured value.

Figure 4 Time courses of the degradation reaction of (2R)-5 (○) and (2S)-5 (●) under physiological conditions (pH 7.40 and 37
°C).
The k values of (2R)-5 and (2S)-5 were 0.405 ± 0.002
and 0.226 ± 0.002 h–1, respectively.

Conclusions
ALP-derived
acyl glucuronides (2RS)-5 were successfully
prepared using our chemo-enzymatic method, and
their chemical structures were fully characterized; the complete β-configuration
of (2RS)-5 was confirmed by 1H NMR as well as by exhaustive hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase.
The intrinsic degradation rate constant of (2R)-5 was approximately twice that of (2S)-5 under physiological conditions (pH 7.40, 37 °C). The
absolute stereochemistry of both ALP 1 and (2RS)-5 was determined by comparison with chemically
synthesized (2R)-1 and (2R)-5, respectively. We have prepared the enantiomers
of ALP 1 and developed the HPLC analytical conditions
for these compounds. Further studies are in progress on the UGT isozyme(s)
responsible for glucuronidation of 1, the chiral inversion65,66 from (2R)-1 to (2S)-1, and the membrane transporters for both 1 and (2RS)-5 in Caco-2 cells.

HPLC Apparatus and Analysis
Reactions were analyzed
using a Shimadzu LC-10A equipped with an appropriate HPLC column,
a Shimadzu SPD-10A VP UV detector (monitoring at 254 nm), and a Shimadzu
CTO-10AS VP column oven set at 30 °C. The HPLC columns used were
CHIRALCEL OZ-H (DAICEL; 5 μm, 10 × 250 mm2)
for chiral resolution, CHIRALPAK IG (DAICEL; 5 μm, 4.6 ×
250 mm2) for determination of the enantiomeric purity of
the chiral compounds, symmetry C18 (Waters;

reaction of (2RS)-5.

Isolation of
ALP 1
ALP 1 was
isolated from 12 Lumifen tablets containing a total of 2.4 g of 1. The tablets were crushed and extracted twice with ethyl
acetate (each 80 mL) by stirring for 5 min. The combined organic extracts
were washed with water (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant
crude product was purified by recrystallization to afford 1 (2.04 g) in 85% yield: mp 106–107 °C (white crystals

Optical Resolution of 1
Optical resolution
was performed using a CHIRALCEL OZ-H chiral preparative column equilibrated
with n-hexane/EtOH/AcOH = 90/10/0.1 (v/v) at a flow
rate of 2.5 mL/min. A 200 μL aliquot of 9.0 mg/mL 1 in the mobile phase was injected onto the column for each separation.
The retention times of (2R)-1 and (2S)-1 were 19.0 and 15.5 min, respectively.
Both enantiomers were almost completely resolved, and their optical
purities (% ee) were each >99%. The absolute configuration of the
chiral center was unambiguously determined by confirming the retention
time of the (2R)-1 enantiomer and that
of authentic (2R)-1 synthesized from
(2R)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)propanoic acid (2R)-6 (see below). Chiral HPLC was conducted using a CHIRALPAK
IG analytical column equilibrated with 55% (v/v) MeOH containing 56
mM formic acid (pH 2.1) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and monitored
at 254 nm. The retention times of (2R)-1 and (2S)-1 were 15.9 and 18.8 min,
respectively. The specific optical rotation [α]D26 values of (2R)-1 and (2S)-1 were −57° (c = 0.42, EtOH) and +60°
(c = 0.30, EtOH), respectively.

Synthesis of
(2R)-1 from (2R)-6 Obtained by Optical Resolution of (2RS)-6
Commercially available (2RS)-6 was purified by column chromatography
(silica gel; CHCl3/MeOH/AcOH = 100/1/1) followed by charcoal
treatment to remove impurities and colored components. Optical resolution
of purified (2RS)-6 was performed by
a diastereomeric salt method57 using (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine as follows: To a stirred
solution of the purified (2RS)-6 (1.02
g, 5.23 mmol) in EtOAc (50 mL) was added (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine
(0.34 mL, 2.6 mmol) to afford a white precipitate. The mixture was
heated to reflux, and then the clear solution was allowed to stand
at room temperature. The precipitated white needles were collected
and recrystallized from EtOAc (50 mL) to afford (2R)-6-derived salt (552 mg). The optical purity (% ee)
was 87.4% as determined using a CHIRALPAK IG chiral column equilibrated
with n-hexane/EtOH/TFA = 800:200:1 (v/v) at a flow
rate of 0.6 mL/min. The retention times of (2R)-6 and (2S)-6 were 10.5 and 12.2
min, respectively. A fourth recrystallization using the same conditions
as described above increased the percent enantiomeric excess (% ee)
of the (2R)-6-derived salt (400 mg)
to 95.2%. The salt was next treated with EtOAc (30 mL) and 0.33 M
HCl (10 mL) saturated with NaCl, and then the organic layer was dried
over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the organic
solvent under reduced pressure, (2R)-6 (281 mg, 55%) was obtained as a white solid with a % ee of 95.3%.
The R configuration was confirmed by its [α]D25 value of −53.1°
(c = 0.565, CHCl3), which is comparable
to the reported value (lit.,67 [α]D25 −55.3°).
Catalytic hydrogenation of (2R)-6 (220
mg, 1.13 mmol) was performed in MeOH (3.0 mL) with 10% Pd–C
(20 mg) at room temperature for 4 h to afford the corresponding (R)-2-(4-aminophenyl)propionic acid (2R)-7 as a pale pink solid (171 mg, 92%). HRMS (ESI, positive):
[M + H]+ calcd for C9H12NO2, m/z 166.0869; found, m/z 166.0863 (error 0.6 mmu). The final
step of N-(2-methyl)allylation of (2R)-7 (96 mg, 0.58 mmol) was performed at 70 °C with
3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene (83 μL, 0.85 mmol) and KF–Celite51 (150 mg) in CH3CN (2.5 mL) for 12
h. After removal of the insoluble materials, the solvent from filtrate
was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford crude solid, which
was purified by preparative TLC to afford (2R)-1 (57 mg, 44%). The retention time and optical purity (% ee)
of (2R)-1 obtained were 15.9 min and
95.4%, respectively, using a CHIRALPAK IG chiral column equilibrated
with 55% (v/v) MeOH containing 56 mM formic acid (pH 2.1) at a flow
rate of 0.8 mL/min and monitored at 254 nm.

Synthesis of Methyl 1-β-O-2-{4-[(2-Methylprop-2-en-1-yl)amino]phenyl}propanoyl-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-d-glucopyranuro-nate (2RS)-3 (Mixture of Two Diastereomers)
To a stirred
solution of (2RS)-1 (493 mg, 2.25 mmol)
in 8.0 mL of EtOH, 2.25 mL of 0.50 mol/L aqueous Cs2CO3 was added. After brief sonication to dissolve the cesium
salt, the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. To remove
water, EtOH (3.0 mL) was added to the residue and the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved with 20
mL of DMSO, and then methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromo-1-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranuronate 2 (1.14 g, 2.72 mmol) was added
at room temperature with vigorous stirring. The reaction was monitored
by HPLC using a symmetry C18 column eluted
with 50% (v/v) CH3CN containing 25 mM ammonium acetate
(pH 4.5) and 10 mM tetra-n-butylammonium bromide
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and monitored at 254 nm. The retention
times of (2RS)-1 and (2RS)-3 were 8.15 and 36.5 min, respectively. After 3 h,
the reaction mixture was diluted with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and
then washed three times with water (each 70 mL), four times with 0.1
mol/L NaOH (each 40 mL), and then once with saturated saline (70 mL).
After drying over Na2SO4, the organic solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure. Column chromatography (silica;
EtOAc/benzene = 2/5) of the residue afforded (2RS)-3 (663 mg) as a colorless syrup in 53% yield. HRMS

Enzyme-Catalyzed Chemo-Selective Removal of the O-Acetyl Groups of (2RS)-3 to (2RS)-4
Of the trials for the enzymatic O-deacetylation of (2RS)-3 using LAS and CSR, concurrent use of LAS and CSR (1:10, w/w) proved
to be the most effective and exhibited the highest chemo-selective
activity. To a stirred solution of (2RS)-3 (108 mg, 0.202 mmol) in 15 mL of DMSO at 40 °C was added a
solution of LAS (50 mg; 0.5 mg/mL incubation mixture) and CSR (550
mg; 5.5 mg/mL incubation mixture) in 85 mL of 25 mM sodium citrate
buffer (pH 5.0) thermally pre-equilibrated at 40 °C. The mixture
was gently stirred for 15 min at 40 °C, and then the temperature
was raised to 50 °C. After a total of 7 h of incubation, the
conversion yield to methyl 1-β-O-2-{4-[(2-methylprop-2-en-1-yl)amino]phenyl}propanoyl-d-glucopyranuronate (2RS)-4 was
calculated to be 94% by HPLC using a symmetry C18 column eluted with 35% (v/v) CH3CN containing
25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) and 10 mM tetra-n-butylammonium bromide at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and monitored
at 254 nm. The retention times of 1 and (2RS)-4 were 23.7 and 16.3 min, respectively. The product
was extracted with EtOAc (50 mL × 3), and the organic solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford crude (2RS)-4. A part of the sample was purified by TLC for HRMS
analysis. HRMS (ESI, positive): [M + Na]+ calcd for C20H27NO8Na, m/z 432.1629; found, m/z 432.1630 (error 0.1 mmu); 1H NMR (600 MHz, MeOH-d4): δ 7.04 (d, 2H, J =

Enzyme-Catalyzed
Chemo-Selective Hydrolysis of the Methyl Ester
of (2RS)-4 to (2RS)-5
Of the enzymes tested, CALB and Chirazyme L-2 CB
showed high chemo-selective activities, yielding almost quantitatively
the product (2RS)-5 (see Table 2). The hydrolytic reaction was
monitored by HPLC using a symmetry C18 column eluted with 35% (v/v) CH3CN containing 25 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 4.5) and 10 mM tetra-n-butylammonium
bromide at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. (1) Method with CALB. CALB (2.0
mg/mL 25 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0) was treated with XAD-4
resin wetted (80–200 mesh, 40 mg) in an ice water bath for
5 min with gentle shaking to remove impurities. Hydrolysis of (2RS)-4 with the abovementioned CALB (a final
concentration of 1.0 mg/mL) was performed at 40 °C with an initial
concentration of 1.0 mM (2RS)-4 in 20
mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 10% (v/v) DMSO. (2) Method
with Chirazyme L-2 CB. Hydrolysis of (2RS)-4 with Chirazyme L-2 CB (a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL)
was performed at 40 °C with an initial concentration of 1.0 mM
(2RS)-4 in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer
(pH 5.0) containing 10% (v/v) DMSO. The concentration of the substrate
(2RS)-4 was able to rise to 4 mM. (3)
Isolation of (2RS)-5. After 1.5 h of
the incubation starting from 0.22 mmol of (2RS)-4 and 55 mg of Chirazyme L-2 CB, the mixture (55 mL) was loaded
onto an XAD-4 column (10 g, 1.6 cm i.d.), which had been washed thoroughly
with acetone and then equilibrated with aqueous water. The column
was washed with 50 mL of water, 200 mL of 4 mM HCl, and then 50 mL
of water. The product (2RS)-5 was eluted
with 200 mL of 20% (v/v) aqueous CH3CN. Fractions containing
(2RS)-5 were pooled, the solvent was
evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dried over
P2O5 in a vacuum desiccator to afford a pale
yellow solid (83 mg, 95%). HRMS (ESI, negative): [M – H]− calcd for C19H24NO8, m/z 394.1507; found, m/z 394.1518 (error 1.1 mmu); 1H NMR (600 MHz, MeOH-d4): δ 7.06

1-β-O-2-{4-[(2-Methylprop-2-en-1-yl)amino]phenyl}propanoyl-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-d-glucopyranuronate (2R)-3
In accordance to the abovementioned procedure
for the synthesis of (2RS)-3, the cesium
salt prepared from (2R)-1 (25 mg, 0.11
mmol) was reacted with methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromo-1-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranuronate (2) (57 mg, 0.14 mmol) at room
temperature for 2 h to afford (2R)-3 (25 mg) in 40% yield. HRMS (ESI, positive): [M + Na]+ calcd for C26H33NO11Na, m/z 558.1946; found, m/z 558.1959 (error 1.3 mmu); 1H NMR (600

the preparation of (2RS)-5 from (2RS)-3, enzyme-catalyzed chemo-selective hydrolysis
of the sugar-protecting groups of (2R)-3 was performed using LAS and CSR followed by using Chirazyme L-2
CB to afford (2R)-5. HRMS (ESI, negative):
[M – H]− calcd for C19H24NO8, m/z 394.1507; found, m/z 394.1513 (error 0.6 mmu).

Measurement
of the Intrinsic Degradation Rate Constants (k Values)
of (2RS)-5
The k values of (2RS)-5 (an initial concentration
of 0.10 mM) were measured under physiological
conditions (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.40 and 37 °C).
The degradation reaction was monitored by HPLC using an L-column2
ODS eluted with 30% (v/v) CH3CN containing 25 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 4.5) and 10 mM tetra-n-butylammonium
bromide at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and monitored at 254 nm. Aliquots
of the reaction mixture sampled at appropriate intervals were diluted
with the HPLC mobile phase and kept in an ice bath until HPLC analysis.
The HPLC mobile phase was slightly acidic to prevent further degradation
of both the starting compounds and the resultant acyl-migrated compounds
before and during HPLC analysis. Using these optimized HPLC conditions,
the retention times of (2R)-5 and (2S)-5 were 29.1 and 30.2 min, respectively.
