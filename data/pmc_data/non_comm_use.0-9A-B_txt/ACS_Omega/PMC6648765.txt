Multifunctionalizable
polymeric nanofibers can be tailored for
various biomedical applications by selective conjugation of small
molecules and bioactive ligands. This study reports the design, synthesis,
and application of novel biodegradable polyester-based nanofibers
bearing metal-free “clickable” handles. Polylactide-based
polymers were synthesized using organo-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization
to contain “clickable” chain-end functional groups that
specifically react through radical or nucleophilic thiol–ene
reactions. A furan-protected maleimide-containing hydroxyl-bearing
initiator yielded polymers containing strained oxanorbornene unit
at their chain end. In addition, postpolymerization thermal treatment
provides maleimide end group-containing polymers. Solution electrospinning
method was utilized to obtain bead-free nanofibers. Efficient conjugation
on these nanofibers was demonstrated using metal-free conjugation
reactions. It was observed that polylactide nanofibers undergo extensive
biofouling, which limits their possible utilization for specific biomolecular
immobilization. To alleviate this problem, polymers were modified
to contain two orthogonally reactive functional groups, namely, the
oxanorbornene unit and an azide group at their chain ends. The former
reactive handle was used for conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol)
chains to impart hydrophilicity and thus an antibiofouling ability,
whereas the azide group undergoes strain-promoted azide–alkyne
cycloaddition to install a protein-binding ligand such as biotin.
These nanofibers were able to specifically immobilize the protein
streptavidin with minimal nonspecific adsorption.

Introduction
Polymeric nanofibers
have emerged as an attractive class of nanomaterials
in biomedical sciences over the past decade because of their unique
properties. In particular, the high surface area and porosity of nanofibrous
materials make them suitable for immobilization and encapsulation
of ligands, biomolecules, and cells. Additional properties such as
their resemblance to the fibrillar structure of the extracellular
matrix makes them suitable for adhesion and proliferation of cells,
which govern cellular organization, survival, and their function.
Furthermore, the availability of a wide pool of polymers enables tuning
the chemical composition of nanofibers. Until recently, most polymeric
nanofibers were fabricated using commercially available polymers which
often lack functional groups that would enable immobilization of ligands
and biomolecules in a specific manner with high efficiency under mild
conditions. The lack of reactive sites on the surface of parent fibers
is addressed through their surface modification using plasma treatment
and wet chemical methods such as acid treatment.1−3 Such treatments
often compromise the mechanical stability of the polymeric material
and do not introduce functional groups that allow efficient transformation
directly without the need of additional wet chemical activation steps.
An alternative to this approach involves utilization of reactive and
clickable polymers for fabrication of nanofibers.4 This approach has gained a lot of interest since the advent
of click chemistry, which utilizes transformations that allow efficient
postpolymerization functionalization. Importantly, it is the high
efficiency of click reactions under mild reaction conditions that
enables facile functionalization of heterogenous interfaces as encountered
during surface functionalization of bulk materials. For example, multifunctionalization
of crosslinked polymeric films have been reported by Hawker et al.
by employing combination of several click-based transformations.5,6 Nanofibers provide an alternative surface morphology due to their
nanosize dimensions. Initial reports of nanofiber modifications were
based on the Huisgen-type Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
(CuAAC) reactions,7,8 a methodology which is now being
employed with reservation because of the likelihood of residual toxic
metal impurities in the material. Because of this reason, metal-free
click reactions such as nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene
reactions, strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC),
and the Diels–Alder cycloaddition have gained popularity for
the surface modification of nanofibers.9,10 For example,
in a recent work by Becker et al., chain-end reactive poly(lactide)
(PLA) nanofibers were prepared using 4-dibenzyocyclooctynol as the
initiator for the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of l-lactide
and were postfunctionalized with N3-GYIGSR peptide via
SPAAC reaction.11 The same group also studied
multifunctionality of nanofibers by sequentially functionalizing the
poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers with Gly–Arg–Gly–Asp–Ser
(GRGDS), BMP-2 peptide, and dopamine via SPAAC, oxime ligation, and
CuAAC, respectively.12 Other recent examples
include the radical thiol–ene and Diels–Alder reactions
for metal-free functionalization of polymeric nanofibers.13−15 Interestingly, there is lack of electrospun fibers that can undergo
either nucleophilic thiol–ene or inverse electron demand Diels–Alder
(iedDA) cycloaddition, both known to be very efficient click-type
transformations. Interestingly, the oxanorbornene cycloadduct provides
a molecular structure that can undergo rapid iedDA and radical thiol–ene
addition, whereas the thermal treatment of cycloadduct yields the
maleimide unit, a well-known Michael acceptor that undergoes rapid
thiol–ene addition. Incorporation of these reactive handles
in biodegradable nanofibers will certainly expand the toolbox of functionalizable
biopolymers for fabrication of functional materials.

Reactive
biodegradable polymers are the frequently used materials
for various biomedical applications that benefit from multiple attachment
of biologically active materials such as drugs, proteins, enzymes,
growth factors, and so forth. In recent years, environmentally friendly
biomaterials based on renewable resources have gained increasing attraction.16,17 In particular, aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(glycolide), PLA,
and PCL, are among the commonly used polymeric materials employed
in biomedical applications as a result of their biocompatibility and
biodegradability properties.18,19 PLA has received particular
interest as its raw material, l-lactic acid, can be obtained
through the fermentation of renewable resources such as corn and sugars.20 Besides these advantages, PLA also possesses
good mechanical properties. Consequently, PLA is widely used for biomedical
applications such as drug delivery, absorbable sutures, medical implants,
scaffolds for tissue engineering, and so forth.21,22 Owing to the wide range of applications, in this study we chose
to utilize PLA for demonstrating the functionalization strategy, which
can be readily adapted to other biodegradable polymers obtained using
ROP. PLA can be obtained via the ROP of lactide, initiated by an alcohol
in the presence of a catalyst. In our recent study, a furan-bearing
PLA was synthesized via organo-catalyzed ROP and electrospun into
Diels–Alder clickable nanofibers.23 These nanofibers were modified with RGD peptide and found to promote
cell attachment and proliferation. Although the Diels–Alder
reaction with a furan-based system offers several advantages, it is
limited in its ability to conjugate molecules bearing maleimide groups.

In this study, biodegradable nanofibers that undergo facile functionalization
using metal catalyst-free “click” reactions are fabricated,
and their utility toward specific ligand-mediated protein immobilization
is demonstrated (Scheme 1). A chain-end functional PLA was synthesized via organo-catalyzed
ROP using a furan-protected maleimide functional group containing
alcohol as an initiator. After polymerization, the furan-protecting
group was removed to obtain the thiol-reactive maleimide group. These
polymers were electrospun from chloroform solution to yield nanofibers.
Although these nanofibers could be readily functionalized with small
thiol-containing molecules using various “click” reactions,
they failed as supports for selective biomolecular immobilization
because of their high disposition toward biofouling. To expand the
utility of these nanofibers for specific bioimmobilization, the hydroxyl
end group of the PLA was converted to an azide group to provide dual-functionality.
Ability of nanofibers to undergo dual-functionalization was investigated
using the SPAAC and iedDA reactions with appropriate fluorescent dyes.
At this point, dual-functionalization was used to undertake biotinylation
and PEGylation of nanofibers, which enabled immobilization of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled streptavidin in a specific manner.

To Introduce Bioactive Ligand against an Anti-biofouling Matrix
Results and Discussion
The furan-protected maleimide group containing PLA (FM-PLA) which
bears a strained alkene unit was synthesized using a masked maleimide-containing
alcohol as an initiator using organocatalyzed ROP, using a previously
reported procedure.24 In our case, the
catalyst system was replaced with a combination of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) and 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-cyclohexylthiourea
(TU) and polymerizations were carried out in anhydrous dichloromethane
(DCM) at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1). The organo-catalyzed polymerization
was chosen because it proceeds at ambient temperature and thus avoids
the risk of unmasking the maleimide group via a retro Diels–Alder
reaction and does not leave any residual metal impurities in the resulting
polymer. The thus-obtained polymer was characterized using 1H NMR and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), the former characterization
confirming the presence of the oxabicyclic reactive group in the polymer.
The parent copolymer was modified to obtain the polymer M-PLA containing
a maleimide group at the chain end by removing the furan protection
through retro Diels–Alder reaction at 110 °C. This would
enable conjugation of thiol-containing molecules through the nucleophilic
thiol–ene reaction that does not require any thiyl radical
formation.

Figure 1 Synthesis of chain-end reactive PLA polymers.

Nanofibers from the FM-PLA and M-PLA polymers were obtained
using
a solution electrospinning method. Optimum conditions for electrospinning
were established by varying experimental parameters such as solvent,
polymer solution concentration, applied voltage, solution injection
flow rate, and the needle to collector distance. A solution of the
polymer in chloroform (35 wt %) provided uniform nanofibers using
14 kV applied voltage with a needlecollector distance of 12 cm. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated formation of bead-free
nanofibers with average diameters of 278 ± 112 and 277 ±
131 nm, for FM-PLA and M-PLA nanofibers, respectively (Figure 2).

Figure 2 SEM images and histograms
of (A) FM-PLA and (B) M-PLA nanofibers.

Initial functionalization of FM-PLA nanofibers was examined
by
immobilization of an activated thiol-containing fluorescein dye via
radical thiol–ene reaction. An aqueous solution containing
the thiol-containing dye and 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone
as the photoinitiator was dropped on the glass slide covered with
FM-PLA nanofibers, which was then placed under UV (365 nm) irradiation
for 5 min. The surface was rinsed with excess water to remove the
unreacted dye. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the nanofibers
revealed that the thiol-containing fluorescence probe reacted with
the alkene groups on the nanofibers (Figure 3a). No dye attachment was observed in a control
experiment carried out using the similar procedure but no UV-irradiation,
thus supporting the attachment of dye through radical thiol–ene
conjugation.

Figure 3 Thiol–ene-based functionalization reactions and
fluorescence
microscopy images of SAMSA dye conjugation on (A) FM-PLA nanofibers
via radical thiol–ene and (B) M-PLA nanofibers via Michael
reaction. Images from control experiments are shown as insets.

Although the radical thiol–ene
reaction provides an effective
method for conjugation of thiol-containing molecules, the method involves
utilization of a photoinitiator and UV-irradiation. Conjugation of
thiol-containing molecules using the nucleophilic thiol–ene
Michael-type reaction, on the other hand, proceeds without such requirements.
It proceeds with high efficiencies under mild and benign conditions.
Hence, the thiol-containing fluorescent dye 5-((2-(and-3)-S-(acetylmercapto)succinoyl)amino)fluorescein
(SAMSA) was immobilized on the maleimide-containing M-PLA nanofibers
in the dark for 6 h. The unbound dye was rinsed off with ample water,
and the fibers were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. On investigation
using fluorescence microscopy, green bright-green fluorescence of
the functionalized nanofibers indicated successful conjugation through
the Michael reaction (Figure 3B). As a control experiment, SAMSA-treated masked maleimide
FM-PLA nanofibers did not show any significant attachment of the dye.

After successful conjugation of thiol-containing molecules in a
specific manner, we sought to expand the utility of these nanofibers
for biomolecular immobilization of proteins. Ability to detect a protein
selectively with nanofibers conjugated with specific ligands will
also show their potential as viable platforms for detection. Specific
attachment of growth factors and antibodies can modulate the interaction
of these nanofiber scaffolds with various cells. However, to conjugate
a biomolecule with specificity, the nanofibers should be inherently
antibiofouling. Hence, we evaluated the suitability of nanofibers
with masked and unmasked maleimide groups toward nonspecific binding
of proteins. To our dismay, we noticed that when these nanofibers
were treated with FITC bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA), a high level
of protein absorbed onto these nanofibers through nonspecific binding
(Figure 4A). It is
well known that incorporation of hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) into nanofibers reduces nonspecific absorption of biomolecules.
Hence, we decided that attachment of PEG chains onto these nanofibers
will decrease such undesirable biofouling. Treatment of FM-PLA nanofibers
with a PEG chain containing a tetrazine unit led to the attachment
of hydrophilic short chains on the fibers through the tetrazine norbornene
iedDA cycloaddition reaction. It was observed that such PEGylation
of the FM-PLA nanofibers imparted them with antibiofouling characteristic,
which prevented the nonspecific FITC-BSA conjugation (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Evaluation of antibiofouling
on nonPEGylated and PEGylated nanofibers
and fluorescence microscopy images of FITC-BSA conjugation on (A)
FM-PLA and (B) PEGylated FM-PLA nanofibers.

To realize nanofiber functionalization without sacrificing
the
reactive groups required for ligand attachment, we decided to introduce
another reactive handle on the parent polymer. The presence of a chain-end
hydroxyl functional group in the parent polymers provided a simple
route to install an azide unit, a moiety well known to undergo highly
efficient conjugation with cyclo-octyne-bearing molecules through
the SPAAC reaction. The dual functionalizable polymer (FM-PLA–N3) was prepared by converting the terminal hydroxyl group of
FM-PLA polymer to an azide group by esterification with 4-azidobutanoicacid
in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDCI) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) (Figure 5). Presence of the azide group at the polymer
chain end was confirmed from 1H NMR spectroscopy and from
the strong azide stretching vibration in the Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy spectrum of the polymer (see Supporting Information). Uniform bead-free nanofibers with average diameter
of 297 ± 128 nm were obtained using electrospinning of a 35 wt
% chloroform solution of the FM-PLA–N3 polymer.

of the dual-functional PLA and (B) SEM and size-distribution
histogram of FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers.

Ability to undergo dual-functionalization was probed
by treatment
of nanofibers with an aqueous solution of a tetrazine-appended Cy5-dye,
via iedDA ene–tetrazine click chemistry. After incubation at
room temperature, the unbound dye was rinsed off with excess water
and successful conjugation was confirmed from their bright red fluorescence
(Figure 6). Thereafter,
the Cy5-conjugated FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers were treated
with an aqueous solution of a DBCO-appended green fluorescent dye.
Successful conjugation of the dye on the nanofiber via the SPAAC reaction
between the azide-end group and DBCO group at room temperature was
confirmed from the green fluorescence of the nanofibers.

dye conjugation on Cy5-tetrazine-immobilized FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers via SPAAC, and (C) merged image showing the dual-functionalization
of the FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers.

As expected, the dual functionalizable FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers were also prone toward high nonspecific binding
of proteins,
as revealed from the green fluorescence of nanofibers on treatment
with aqueous solution containing FITC-streptavidin (Figure 7A). Hence, the FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers were PEGylated to impart antibiofouling property
using tetrazine–mPEG via the iedDA reaction. Nanofibers were
treated with an aqueous tetrazine–mPEG solution for 6 h. On
removal of unbound tetrazine–PEG and drying the nanofibers
under nitrogen, they were treated with a solution of FITC-BSA. To
our satisfaction, presence of negligible green fluorescence confirmed
that PEGylation induced antibiofouling (Figure 7B). Attachment of hydrophilic PEG chains
was also evident from the change in the water contact angle that decreased
from 120° ± 4.44° to 85° ± 10.17° after
PEGylation (Figure 7C,D).

FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers. Water contact angles of (C)
non-PEGylated and (D) PEGylated FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers.

Next, we aimed to examine if these
PEGylated nanofibers containing
reactive handles could undergo ligand-directed biomolecular attachment
in a specific manner. PEGylated nanofibers were biotinylated using
a DBCO-appended biotin via SPAAC reaction. The biotin–streptavidin
pair was chosen because of the high biological interaction between
biotin and avidin molecules. Furthermore, streptavidin contains four
binding sites for biotin which allows the utilization of the remaining
three vacant sites for further immobilization of other biotinylated
biomolecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides to fabricate sensing
platforms. The PEGylated nanofibers were treated with an aqueous solution
of DBCO–PEG4–biotin at room temperature. After 6 h,
the fibers were washed with ample water to remove the unbound ligands,
followed by their incubation in an aqueous solution of FITC-streptavidin
at room temperature in the dark. After 30 min, the nanofibers were
rinsed with water to remove any nonspecifically bound streptavidin.
The bright green fluorescence of the nanofibers indicated successful
protein immobilization (Figure 8A). To verify the availability of the vacant ligand binding
sites on the streptavidin, immobilization of a biotinylated dye Cy5-biotin
was attempted. Streptavidin-immobilized nanofibers were treated with
an aqueous solution of Cy5-biotin at room temperature for 30 min.
The bright red fluorescence confirmed attachment of the Cy5-biotin
molecule, thus demonstrating that the streptavidin-coated nanofibers
could be further conjugated with biotinylated materials (Figure 8B).

Cy5-biotin binding on FITC-streptavidin-immobilized nanofibers.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate
that multifunctional biodegradable nanofibers
can be readily tailored for particular applications through facile
conjugation of (bio)molecules of interest. A furan-protected maleimide
group containing alcohol-initiated ROP of lactide provides a parent
polymer that can be functionalized either using radical thiol–ene
or iedDA reaction. Furthermore, modification of the chain-end reactive
group in the parent polymer to a nucleophilic thiol-reactive form
is achieved by simple unmasking of the maleimide group. Importantly,
the available hydroxyl group at the other extremity of the polymer
could be readily modified to incorporate an azide group, which undergoes
catalyst-free conjugation through the SPAAC reaction. Multifunctionalization
of nanofibers obtained using these polymers highlights the utility
of orthogonal reactivity, where the azide group is used to incorporate
the ligand necessary for specific protein immobilization and the oxanorbornene
unit is used to integrate the antibiofouling PEG segment which enables
the selective ligand-mediated protein immobilization. One can envision
that the facile fabrication and functionalization of these biodegradable
“clickable” nanofibers would make them attractive candidates
for various biomedical applications.

for 24 h, and stored in a nitrogen filled glovebox. DBU (Fluka) was
dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves and stored in a nitrogen
filled glovebox. Furan-protected maleimide-containing alcohol,25 TU26 and 4-azido
butyric acid27 were synthesized according
to the literature procedure. Polymerizations were done in a glovebox
using anhydrous DCM obtained from a dry solvent system. Toluene (VWR
chemicals), DMAP (Aldrich), and EDCI (Alfa Aesar) were used as received.
SAMSA (fluorescein; Invitrogen) was activated according to the literature

110, tetrazine–mPEG (5 kDa), DBCO–PEG4–biotin,
and Cy5-biotin were purchased from Click Chemistry Tools. FITC-streptavidin
was purchased from Pierce. 1H NMR spectra of the polymers
were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer using trimethylsilane
as an internal reference and deuterated chloroform as a solvent. The
molecular weights of the polymers were estimated by SEC analysis using
a PSS-SDV (length/i.d. 8 × 300 mm, 10 μm particle size)
Linear M column calibrated with polystyrene standards (1–150
kDa) using a refractive-index detector. Tetrahydrofuran was used as
the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 at 30 °C.
The morphology of electrospun nanofibers was observed with Jeol Neoscope
JCM-5000 SEM. Fluorescence images of the samples were recorded at
room temperature on a Zeiss Observer Z1 fluorescence microscope. UV
light (365 nm) was used for thiol–ene reactions. Static water
contact angles were measured in air via the sessile-drop method using
a goniometer (CAM 101 KSV instruments). Approximately 5 μL of
deionized water was deposited on the surface, and images were taken
by an integrated digital camera. The software CAM2008 was used for
image processing to determine the contact angle. The contact angle
value for each sample was independently measured at three different
locations and average values were measured.

were placed in a vial under nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box. Anhydrous
DCM (3 mL) was added as the solvent and DBU (13.88 μL, 0.092
mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was left to
stir for 24 h at room temperature in the glovebox. The reaction was
quenched with benzoic acid and the resulting polymer was purified
by precipitation in 1:1 methanol/ether. The polymer was dried in vacuo
for 24 h at room temperature. ([M]0/[I]0 = 150, Mn,SEC = 14.7 kg/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.31).

Synthesis of
Maleimide-Ended PLA (M-PLA) Polymers

× 10–1 mmol), DMAP (4.155 mg, 3.4 × 10–2 mmol),
and EDCI (6.52 mg, 3.4 × 10–2 mmol) were placed
in a round bottom flask with a stir bar at room temperature using
anhydrous DCM as the solvent. After 16 h, the solution was extracted
with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 M HCl, and again
with water. The organic solution was dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. ([M]0/[I]0 = 150, Mn,SEC = 14.0 kg/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.38).

Electrospinning of PLA Polymers
Polymer solutions were
prepared by dissolving polymers (250 mg) in CHCl3 (0.3
mL). Using a syringe pump, the solution was delivered at a constant
flow rate to a blunt needle connected to a high-voltage power supply.
For a typical experiment, the tip to collector distance was 12 cm,
the applied voltage was 14 kV, and the flow rate was 0.01 mL min–1. Fibers were collected on 22 × 22 mm glass slides
attached on a grounded aluminum collector.

Fluorescent Dye Conjugation

Reaction
SAMSA was activated according to the literature
procedure prior to use. 5 μL of the activated SAMSA solution
(1 mg/120 μL) in distilled water was dropped on FM-PLA nanofiber-containing
glass slide using 1.1 μL 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone
(1.3 mg/mL) as the photoinitiator and exposed to UV light (365 nm)
for 5 min. The slides were washed with ample water to remove the unbound
dye. The conjugation was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy.

Fluorescent Dye Conjugation on M-PLA Nanofibers via Michael

Thereafter, the slide was washed with ample water to remove the excess
dye. The dye conjugation was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy.

FITC-BSA Conjugation on FM-PLA Nanofibers
FITC-BSA
solution (10 μL) in 1× phosphate buffered saline (1 mg/mL)
was dropped on the FM-PLA nanofiber-coated glass slide in the dark
at room temperature. After 6 h, surfaces were washed and dried under
a nitrogen stream. As a control experiment, PEGylated FM-PLA nanofibers
were treated with FITC-BSA under the same conditions.

Dual Fluorescent
Dye Conjugation on FM-PLA-N3 Nanofibers
Cy5-tetrazine
solution (10 μL, 1 mg/mL) in distilled water
was dropped on an FM-PLA–N3 nanofiber-coated glass
slide. After 6 h at room temperature in the dark, the glass slide
was washed with water to remove any unbound dye. Then, an aqueous
solution of DBCO–PEG4–carboxyrhodamine 110 (10 μL,
1 mg/mL) was dropped on the Cy5-tetrazine-immobilized nanofibers.
The reaction was carried out for 6 h in the dark at room temperature.
The slide was washed with ample water to remove the excess dye and
dried under nitrogen stream. The conjugations were analyzed using
fluorescence microscopy.

PEGylation and Enzyme Immobilization on FM-PLA-N3 Nanofibers
At first, FM-PLA–N3 nanofibers
were PEGylated using an aqueous solution of tetrazine–mPEG
(5 kDa). Tetrazine–mPEG solution (10 μL, 1 mg/mL) was
dropped on the FM-PLA–N3 nanofiber-containing glass
surface. After 6 h, the slide was washed with water and dried under
nitrogen stream. Then, the fibers were biotinylated by applying 20
μL of aqueous DBCO–PEG4–biotin solution (1 mg/mL)
on the nanofibers for 6 h at room temperature. The surface was washed
with ample water to remove excess biotin and dried under a stream
of nitrogen. An aqueous FITC-streptavidin solution (10 μL, 0.1
mg/mL) was dropped onto the biotinylated nanofibers at room temperature
in the dark. Excess streptavidin was rinsed off with water after 30
min, and the surface was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Finally,
10 μL of aqueous Cy5-biotin solution (0.1 mg/mL) was dropped
on the streptavidin-immobilized nanofibers at room temperature. After
30 min in the dark, the fibers were rinsed with ample water and dried
under a stream of nitrogen. All conjugations steps were analyzed using
fluorescence microscopy.
