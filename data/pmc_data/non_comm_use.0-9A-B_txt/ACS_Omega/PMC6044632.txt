Elongated nanoparticles
have recently been shown to have distinct
advantages over their spherical counterparts in drug delivery applications.
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have rodlike shapes in nature and have
demonstrated biocompatibility in a variety of mammalian cell lines.
In this report, CNCs are put forward as a modular platform for the
production of multifunctional rod-shaped nanoparticles for cancer
imaging and therapy. For the first time, PEGylated metal-chelating
polymers containing diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (i.e.,
mPEG-PGlu(DPTA)18-HyNic and PEG-PGlu(DPTA)25-HyNic) are conjugated to CNCs to enable the chelation of radionuclides
for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The entire conjugation
is based on UV/vis-quantifiable bis-aryl hydrazone-bond formation,
which allows direct quantification of the polymers grafted onto the
CNCs. Moreover, it has been shown that the mean number of polymers
grafted per CNC could be controlled. The CNCs are also fluorescently
labeled with rhodamine and Alexa Fluor 488 by embedding the probes
in the polymer corona. Preliminary evaluation in a human ovarian cancer
cell line (HEYA8) demonstrated that these CNCs are nontoxic and their
penetration properties can be readily assessed in multicellular tumor
spheroids (MCTSs) by optical imaging. These findings provide support
for biomedical applications of CNCs, and further in vitro and in vivo
studies are warranted to evaluate their potential as imaging and therapeutic
agents for cancer treatment.

Introduction
Nanomedicines, owing
to their many advantages over small-molecule
chemotherapeutics, have been pursued extensively for application in
cancer therapy. A number of nanoformulations have been approved for
clinical use (e.g., Doxil and Abraxane) and have been demonstrated
to extend the circulation lifetimes and reduce the commonly observed
toxicities of many chemotherapeutic drugs.1 The physicochemical characteristics of nanocarriers have been shown
to have a profound effect on their biological performance.2−6 In particular, the morphology of nanocarriers has been found to
influence drug loading capacity, solid tumor penetration, and in vivo
blood circulation lifetime.7−9 For example, Discher’s
group found that wormlike micelles (filomicelles) formed from PEGylated
diblock copolymers had higher drug loading and longer circulation
lifetimes than their spherical counterparts.5 As well, Chauhan et al. demonstrated that the tumor penetration
of quantum dot-based rod-shaped particles is greater than that of
similar spherical particles.10 Although
these findings highlight the potential of rodlike nanoparticles in
drug delivery, there are a limited number of reports of materials
that enable robust production of rod- or cylinder-shaped nanocarriers.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which are plant-derived, glucose-based
elongated nanoparticles, offer a unique advantage over other platforms
by enabling a facile manipulation of particle dimensions through the
variation of the source of cellulose and experimental conditions employed
for preparation.11 Besides their oblong
geometry, CNCs have shown to be nontoxic,12,13 biocompatible, and biodegradable,14−16 rendering them ideal
for drug delivery applications.17 Furthermore,
the surface of CNCs exhibits abundant hydroxyl groups, which can be
employed directly in covalent or noncovalent binding18,19 or be further modified to enable attachment of drugs and imaging
agents in addition to active targeting moieties to achieve site-specific
delivery to the desired site.20 However,
the majority of reported surface modifications of CNCs, including
oxidation,21 esterification,22 silylation,18 urethanization,23 and polymer grafting,24,25 involve harsh organic solvents and laborious solvent exchange steps.
These steps make the process less green and undesirable for pharmaceutical
applications because of concerns about toxicity from the residual
solvent.14−16

Here, we describe a green synthetic method
for generating multifunctional
CNCs that are decorated with water-soluble block copolymers (BCPs)
for therapeutic and imaging applications in cancer research. To generate
BCP–CNC conjugates,
we explored a “grafting-onto” approach via bis-aryl
hydrazone
(BAH) formation between the terminal pyridylhydrazine group on the
BCP and benzaldehyde groups on the surface of CNCs. The grafting-onto
approach described here offers multiple advantages over other methods
of CNC modification.26 Because the CNCs
and BCPs are independently synthesized and modified prior to coupling,
this approach enables a thorough characterization of each component
and can be expanded to generate a library of BCP–CNC conjugates
with a diverse range of properties and applications. As well, the
coupling chemistry employed in the present study allows for monitoring
of the reaction progress by the increase in the absorbance of the
BAH group at 354 nm.27−29 We demonstrate that the UV absorption property of
BAH not only allows the quantification of the mean number of polymers
per CNC30,31 but also enables precise control of the
polymer grafting density and consequently the loading of therapeutic
agents. Furthermore, the CNC and BCP modification steps as well as
the coupling reaction are performed in aqueous solutions, eliminating
the need for organic solvents.

In the current study, fluorescent
BCP–CNC conjugates were
prepared by grafting biocompatible BCPs onto the surface of fluorescently
labeled CNCs. The BCP employed in this study consists of an outer
PEG block that provides “stealth” properties for in
vivo applications32 and an inner poly(glutamic
acid) (PGlu) block that introduces functional groups for the conjugation
of metal-chelating diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for future
applications in radiotherapy (Scheme 1).33 As a proof-of-concept
evaluation of their potential as imaging agents, the penetration properties
of these BCP–CNCs were investigated in a 3D multicellular tumor
spheroid (MCTS) model of ovarian cancer. Overall, the findings of
this study demonstrate that the “grafting-to” method
of CNC modification offers a robust platform for the preparation and
characterization of BCP–CNC conjugates. We think of these as
stepping-stone experiments for the development of multifunctional
theranostic agents based on which the second-generation CNC derivatives
will be designed and developed to understand the factors that affect
their cellular and in vivo behavior (e.g., pharmacokinetics and biodistribution).
For example, the chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid) binds more tightly to lanthanide ions than DTPA, and thus, corresponding
DOTA derivatives will be useful as carriers of 177Lu3+ for radiotherapy34 and as carriers
of Gd3+ for magnetic resonance imaging.35,36

Grafting densities of 330 mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18
and 185 mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25 molecules were achieved per CNC with an
average length of 170 nm.

Results and Discussion
Surface
Modification of CNCs
In our experimental design,
we wished to convert some of the −OH groups on the surface
of the CNCs to primary amines and then use these as sites of attachment
for metal-chelating diblock copolymers (MC-BCPs) that were synthesized
independently. This constitutes a grafting-onto approach for the construction
of the CNC–BCP structures.37−39

Our starting material
was a commercial CNC suspension, which was filtered (0.45 μm
filter) to remove any possible aggregates. It was characterized by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 1a. The image analysis of 100
individual CNCs gave an average length 170 ± 30 nm and a width
of 12 ± 2 nm, which are in good agreement with the literature
values reported for CNCs from the same source.40

Figure 1 TEM images of (a) pristine CNCs and (b) amine-modified CNCs (CNC–NH2).

Amine groups were introduced to
the surface of CNCs following the
general procedure reported by Dong and Roman41 and is shown in Scheme 2. The first step involved the modification of the CNC surface
with epoxy functional groups by reacting the CNC suspension in a 1
M sodium hydroxide solution with epichlorohydrin at 60 °C. In
the second step, the epoxy rings were opened with ammonium hydroxide
to introduce primary amino groups. Because our goal was to attach
multiple copies of MC-BCPs to the CNCs, we aimed to optimize the reaction
conditions to maximize the number of amino groups per CNC (CNC–NH2). To address the concerns about low stability of the epoxy
group under long reaction times in the presence of 1 M NaOH, the epoxy-ammonia
reaction was optimized by carrying out the reaction with epichlorohydrin
for various times ranging from 40 min to 20 h.

Scheme 2 Illustration of the
Preparation of CNC–NH2
After amination, the resulting CNC–NH2 was treated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and the fluorescein content
of the CNC samples was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490
nm (Figure S1).41 A calibration curve (Figure S2b) was
generated for FITC in ammonium hydroxide at pH = 11 containing 0.02
wt % CNCs. As shown in Figure 2, the maximum degree of amination was obtained from the 1
h epoxidation reaction, which gave a FITC density of 37 μmol
FITC per gram of CNC. Using the value of the nanocrystal width of
12 nm measured from TEM images of filtered CNCs and assuming a CNC
density of 1.6 g/cm3,42 we found
approximately 680 FITC molecules per CNC.

Figure 2 The incorporation of
FITC (μmol per gram of CNC) into CNC–NH2 samples
obtained from CNC samples reacted with epichlorohydrin
for different times.

There were also concerns about CNC integrity during amination
of
CNCs because hot solutions of strong bases have been used to degrade
CNCs.43 However, a TEM image of the CNC–NH2 sample obtained after the 1 h reaction with epichlorohydrin
(Figure 1b) shows that
the morphology remained the same as that of the pristine CNCs, and
an analysis of 100 individual CNCs resulted in similar width and length
values.

Synthesis of the mPEG-MC-BCP
Our synthetic design is
presented in Scheme 3. It begins with the ring-opening polymerization of γ-benzyl-l-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride (BLG-NCA) using
the methoxy-PEG-amine derivative (MeO-PEG48-NH2, number-average degree of polymerization (DPn) = 48 as
determined by 1H NMR, Figure S3) as the initiator. We refer to the poly(γ-benzyl-l-glutamate) diblock copolymer obtained as mPEG48-PBLGn-NH2. Two polymer samples with
different DPn values (DPn = 18 or 25) were obtained,
resulting from different molar ratios of monomer (BLG-NCA) to initiator.
The values of DPn were determined using 1H NMR
by comparing the end group methyl protons on MeO-PEG to the benzyl
methylene signals in the backbone as described in the Supporting Information (see Figures S4 and S5). For instance, DPn = 18 of mPEG-PBLG-NH2 was calculated by comparing the integration of the signal
at 3.23 ppm (end group methyl) to that at 5.03 ppm of benzyl methylene.
These values of DPn for both polymers were in good agreement
with the [monomer]/[initiator] feed ratios. Gel-permeation chromatography
(GPC) analysis showed relatively narrow molecular weight distributions
for both polymers (D̵ = 1.12 and 1.21 for polymers with DPn of 18 and 25, respectively). Thiourea was used as part of
the initiating complex for the preparation of mPEG-PBLG18-NH2 but was omitted for mPEG-PBLG25-NH2 because it gave signals in the 1H NMR that overlapped
with those of the pendant benzyl group (Figure S4). This may account for the broader polydispersity of the
DPn = 25 sample.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)n-HyNic (n = 18 or 25)
The next step in the synthesis
involved tBoc protection
of the amino group at the polymer chain end to enable the transformation
of the pendant groups. The extent of tBoc functionality
was calculated by comparing the integration of the 1H NMR
signal of the tBoc group to that of backbone benzyl
ester groups (Figures S6 and S7). The calculated tBoc functionality for mPEG-PBLG18-Boc and mPEG-PBLG25-Boc was 80% and 94%, respectively.

The mPEG-PBLG-tBoc polymers were then treated
with an excess of ethylenediamine (EDA) at room temperature (RT) to
convert the benzyl groups to aminoethylamide pendant groups.44 This reaction was carried out for different
times ranging from 3 to 5 h to optimize both the amine conversion
and preservation of the tBoc end group. By comparing
the integration of the tBoc protons at 1.44 ppm to
that of the signal at 4.34 ppm (backbone methine), the surviving tBoc functionality for mPEG-PGlu(EDA)18-Boc in
this step stayed the same for the reaction times of 3 h (1H NMR spectrum not shown) and 5 h (Figure S8). The amine conversion, however, increased from 90% to 97% with
increasing reaction time from 3 to 5 h. Thus, a reaction time of 5
h was chosen as the optimum condition. The surviving tBoc functionality for mPEG-PGlu(EDA)25-tBoc was calculated to be 73% for the reaction time of 5 h (Figure S9). For the attachment of
DTPA-chelating groups, we followed the procedure described in Majonis
et al.,45 who employed an excess of DTPA
prereacted with the coupling agent 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium
chloride (DMTMM) to form DTPA monoamide groups. By 1H NMR,
we found that the pendant amine groups of the polymer were fully functionalized
with DTPA to within the ±5% error in measuring NMR signal integrations
(Figures S10 and S11). At this stage, the tBoc group was removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
in a mixture of TFA/water (1:1, v/v).29,44 The 1H NMR spectra of the product showed a complete disappearance of the
peak for the tBoc group (Figures S12 and S13).

To introduce the HyNic group onto the polymer
chain end, the polymers
with exposed amino end groups were treated with succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate
acetone hydrazone (S-HyNic) at pH 8.0 (Scheme 2). The appearance of 1H NMR signals
in the range of 6.6–8.8 ppm indicated that the HyNic group
was successfully attached to the polymer backbone (Figures S14 and S15).30,31 However, the quantification
of HyNic groups by 1H NMR was not reliable because the
signals were too weak to integrate accurately. Instead, we examined
the reaction of the polymers with 4-formylbenzoic acid (4FB-acid)
to form a hydrazone. Hydrazone formation was monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy
at 354 nm, taking advantage of the known molar extinction coefficient
(ε354 nm = 29 000 M–1 cm–1) of the product.46 In this way, we calculated a HyNic content of 73% for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-HyNic and 52% for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic (Figure S16).

CNCs Decorated with 4-formylbenzamide
(4FB)
In our
design (Scheme 4),
we planned to introduce 4FB groups onto the surface of the CNCs and
then use these groups to react with the HyNic groups on the BCP chain
ends via bis-aryl hydrazone (BAH) formation. To introduce 4FB groups,
CNCs with amino groups at the surface were treated with an excess
of N-succinimidyl-4-formylbenzamide (S-4FB) as illustrated
in Scheme 3. The number
of 4FB linkers was quantified via hydrazone-bond formation with 2-hydrazinopyridine
at pH 5.0.31 This process was followed
by UV/vis spectroscopy, and the increase of absorbance at λ
= 350 nm (ε350 = 18 000 M–1 cm–1) was plotted against time. In the example
shown in Figure 3A,
we found 23.1 μmol 4FB/g CNCs, which corresponds, for our CNC
sample, to an average of 620 molecules per CNC. This value is consistent
with the finding reported above of 680 −NH2 groups
per CNC as determined in the reaction with FITC.

buffer at pH 5.0, and the data were collected every 30 s. TEM images

Scheme 4 Surface Modification of CNCs with
4FB Groups Followed by the Attachment
of the Diblock Copolymers via Bis-Aryl Hydrazone Formation
In subsequent reactions, trace
amounts of fluorescent dye molecules
were attached to the CNCs at the same time that the 4FB groups were
attached. In these reactions, we used a mixture of the dye derivative
(either 5/6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine succinimidyl ester Rh552-NHS or Alexa Fluor 488-NHS) with S-4FB and carried out
the reaction as described above. The resulting dye-labeled CNC suspensions
were then thoroughly washed and dialyzed to remove the unreacted dye
in preparation for the polymer conjugation reaction. We refer to the
dye-labeled 4FB-modified CNCs (CNC–4FB) samples as Rh552–CNC–4FB and A488–CNC–4FB,
respectively.

Alexa Fluor 488 is an anionic dye with spectroscopic
properties
similar to those of FITC but with greater photostability for imaging
studies. Tetramethylrhodamine is a cationic dye. It is known that
anionic (e.g., FITC) and cationic (e.g., rhodamine-B isothiocyanate
(RBITC)) dyes attached to the surface of CNCs can affect their interaction
with cells and in some instances impart toxicity to cells.47 As a result, in our design, these dyes are to
be bound adjacent to the CNC surface and thus shielded by the PEG
corona. As we show below, neither dye-labeled CNCs, following grafting
of the BCP, were toxic to HEYA8 cells (a human ovarian cancer cell
line) and both behaved similarly in studies evaluating penetration
into MCTSs.

The Grafting-to Reaction: Covalent Attachment
of the BCPs to
the CNCs
For the CNC–4FB sample, we examined the polymer
conjugation reaction by UV/vis monitoring of BAH formation at λ
= 354 nm.30 The concentration of the CNC–4FB
was diluted to 0.1 wt % with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and an
excess of polymer (mole ratio HyNic:4FB = 15:1) in sodium acetate
buffer was added. As shown in Figure 3B,C the reaction was slow, with the product peak growing
over 20 h. The reaction was stopped at this point, and the extinction
coefficient of the BAH groups (ε354 = 29 000
M–1 cm–1) was used to calculate
the yield of the polymer attached to the CNCs based on the change
in absorbance. In this way, we found 12.3 μmol mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18 and 6.9 μmol mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25 per gram
of CNCs after a reaction time of 20 h. As shown in the TEM images
in Figure 3D,E, the
polymer conjugation reaction did not affect the size or shape of the
CNCs and preserved the rodlike shape of the pristine CNCs. The BCP
attachment corresponds to an average of 330 polymer molecules per
CNC for CNC–PGlu(DTPA)18-PEG and 185 polymer molecules
per CNC for CNC–PGlu(DTPA)25-PEG. These values are
included in Table 1. For the shorter polymer, approximately half of the 620 4FB linkers
available on the CNC surface served as sites of polymer attachment,
whereas for the longer polymer, in this particular reaction, about
30% of the 4FB linkers reacted with the polymer.

run in phosphate buffer ([PB], 0.2 M KNO3, pH 8.5) with
poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) standards.

of the HyNic–4FB conjugation reaction (Figure 3).

d Calculated from the grafting density
in μmol/g of CNCs with reference to the mean surface area and
density of the CNC sample.

In Figure S17, we provide details of
the reactions of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic with Rh552–CNC–4FB and A488–CNC–4FB.
The UV–vis spectra show that the dye makes only a small contribution
to the sample absorbance even at λmax (ΔA ≈ 0.02). This level of dye content is sufficient
to make the CNCs highly fluorescent, but it is small enough that it
does not interfere with monitoring bis-aryl hydrazone formation in
the reaction of the HyNic polymers with the dye–CNC–4FB
derivatives. Unsurprisingly, the reaction of the polymer with the
dye-labeled CNCs occurred over the same timescale as the reaction
of the polymer with the dye-free CNC–4FB.

Kinetics of the HyNic–4FB
Conjugation Reaction
The plots of ΔA vs reaction time shown in Figure 3 provide insights
into the reaction kinetics of BAH formation. In both reactions, the
pyridylhydrazine derivatives were in a large excess relative to the
CNC–4FB. For the reaction of CNC–4FB with 2-hydrazinopyridine
(Figure 3A), the reaction
approached completion after ca. 25 min. In contrast, the polymer–HyNic
reactions were much slower and exhibited a marked slowing down. None
of these growth curves for the increase of absorbance fitted a simple
exponential form. They could, however, be fitted with a stretched
exponential profile 1  where β is the stretch exponent in the
range of 0 < β ≤ 1, ΔA0 = ΔA (t ≅
∞) and k is the characteristic relaxation
rate. Stretched exponentials are often characteristic of a distribution
of reaction rates.48 The fitting curves
are shown in Figure S18 for the reaction
with CNC–4FB, and the fitting parameters are included in Table 2.

A few more comments
are in order about the reaction kinetics. Dirksen
and Dawson49 have shown that the reaction
of 6-hydrazinopyridine and aromatic aldehydes follows simple second-order
kinetics. One predicts that in the presence of a large excess of one
of the reactants, the reaction would follow pseudo-first order kinetics.
In the reaction of the mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)n-HyNic polymer samples with a large excess of 4FB-acid, however,
we found more complicated (nonexponential) behavior (Figure S16). This result is likely a consequence of the fact
that the hydrazine group in the polymer–HyNic is protected
as acetone hydrazone, which first hydrolyzes in the reaction to form
the 6-hydrazinopyridine and then reacts with 4FB-acid.

Controlling
the Number of Polymer Molecules Per CNC
The basic idea of
the experiments described in this section is that
one could monitor the extent of the reaction of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)n-HyNic with CNC–4FB at 354 nm and
stop the reaction at various end points. In this way, one could control
the mean number of polymer molecules per CNC. The extent of polymer
coupling to the CNCs can be calculated from the ΔA value. More important from the perspective of our intended applications,
information about the mean number of polymer molecules per CNC can
be obtained by saturating the DTPA chelator with trivalent metal ions
and measuring the metal-ion content of the CNC–polymer hybrids.
Here, we take advantage of the strong binding of lanthanide ions with
this chelator. For example, the binding affinity of Tb3+ with DTPA-monoamide can be estimated to be on the order of 1022 M–1 at physiological pH.50 The analysis of the sample by inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) enables the metal content and the polymer content
of the BCP–CNC conjugates to be determined.

We tested
this idea by running seven parallel reactions of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic with Rh552–CNC–4FB under
identical conditions, monitoring one of the reactions at 354 nm. The
individual reactions were stopped at different times ranging from
10 to 1400 min. After each time point, the reaction was quenched by
quickly diluting with NaHCO3 buffer (pH = 9.0). Then, the
resulting mixture was dialyzed against water followed by centrifugation
to remove the excess polymer, after which the samples were prepared
for Tb3+ loading. Using the rhodamine-labeled CNC–4FB
suspension enabled us to account for the loss of the sample after
purification by comparing the UV/vis signal of rhodamine (λmax = 552 nm). The details are presented in the Supporting Information.

The results of
these experiments are shown in Figure 4. The continuous curve shown
in black describes the mean number of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-hydrazone groups per CNC calculated from the UV/vis measurements
monitored over 25 h at 354 nm. The red dots and accompanying error
bars represent triplicate ICP-MS measurements from which we also calculated
the mean number of polymers per CNC. This calculation assumes that
a Tb3+ ion was bound to every DTPA group. Previous experiments
from our laboratory with Gd3+ ions and somewhat different
metal-chelating polymers demonstrated that the metal ions became bound
to all of the DTPA pendant groups.45

Figure 4 Polymer–CNC
conjugate formation in the reaction between
the rhodamine-labeled Rh552–CNC–4FB and mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic expressed as the time evolution of the mean number
of polymer molecules per CNC. The black line represents points obtained
by monitoring bis-aryl hydrazone formation through its UV/vis absorbance
at 354 nm. The red points refer to individual reactions quenched at
the indicated time points. For these samples, the DTPA groups on the
polymers were saturated with Tb3+ ions, and the Tb content
of each was measured by ICP-MS.

It is gratifying to find such good agreement between the
two sets
of experiments. The main conclusion to draw from these experiments
is that monitoring the reaction via hydrazone formation allows one
to stop the reaction when the desired number of polymers, on average,
is attached to the CNCs. At the end of the reaction, the polymer–CNC
conjugates can be purified, and they maintain their colloidal stability
and structural integrity.

In Vitro Evaluation of CNC Cytotoxicity and
Penetration into
MCTSs
The CNCs prepared in this study were labeled with two
different fluorescent probes (rhodamine and Alexa Fluor 488), which
enables the assessment of penetration into MCTSs of a human ovarian
cancer cell line (HEYA8) by confocal microscopy. Although nanoparticles
have demonstrated benefits over conventional chemotherapy, the heterogeneous
distribution of nanoparticles as a result of poor tumor penetration
remains one of the major challenges limiting the efficacy of nanomedicine-based
cancer therapy.51 Because of the characteristic
features of the tumor microenvironment, namely, the dense extracellular
matrix, as well as the abnormal vasculature and high interstitial fluid pressure,
the distribution of nanoparticles is largely limited to areas close
to the blood vessels and in the tumor periphery.51,52 As such, evaluation of tumor penetration is key to understanding
the transport properties that ultimately impact the efficacy of nanoparticle-based
drug delivery systems. By the conjugation or incorporation of an imaging
agent, penetration properties of nanoparticles have been evaluated
in vitro and in vivo.53−57 In particular, 3D MCTSs, which mimic the physiological gradients
(e.g., pH, oxygen, nutrient, and proliferation) present in a solid
tumor,58−61 provide a robust model for the evaluation of nanoparticle penetration.57,61

Prior to penetration studies, the cytotoxicity of Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG
and A488–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG was assessed in monolayer cells to determine the appropriate
concentration for penetration studies in MCTSs. The evaluation of
cell viability using the acid phosphatase (APH) assay showed that
both Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG and A488–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG are nontoxic over the range of concentrations studied
up to 0.0035 wt % (Figure S19), and thus,
this concentration was chosen for penetration studies.

Following
24 h of incubation with Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG or A488–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG, the penetration of CNCs into MCTSs was quantitatively
evaluated by obtaining optical slices at three depths (30, 60, and
90 μm) from the spheroid surface. For each optical slice, the
distribution of CNCs was assessed by quantifying the fluorescence
intensity in three equally spaced concentric regions (i.e., periphery,
intermediate, and core). As shown in Figure 5, at a 30 μm distance from the surface
of spheroids, CNCs are homogeneously distributed across the three
regions (periphery, intermediate, and core) of the MCTSs. With increasing
distance from the spheroid surface, a progressive decrease in CNC
penetration from the periphery to intermediate and core regions was
observed. At 90 μm, the concentration of CNCs was significantly
higher in the periphery compared to that in the intermediate and core
regions with very low levels of fluorescence detected in the core.
Using two different fluorescent probes (i.e., rhodamine and Alexa
Fluor 488), similar penetration trends were observed, suggesting that
these fluorescently labeled CNCs provide a robust platform for assessing
the penetration of CNCs for drug delivery applications. The influence
of the particle shape on penetration into MCTSs and cellular endocytosis
will be evaluated in future studies by in vitro comparison of the
rodlike CNCs to their spherical counterparts.

Conclusions
We report the synthesis
of PEG-MC-BCPs with two different numbers
of repeat units containing DTPA (mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-HyNic
and mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic). The polymers were characterized
by 1H NMR and grafted onto the CNC–NH2 via bis-aryl hydrazone conjugation. UV/vis spectroscopy demonstrated
that the conjugation reaction was efficient, with grafting density
of 12.3 μmol/(g CNC) for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-HyNic
and 6.9 μmol/(g CNC) for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic.
The mean number of polymer molecules that could be attached per CNC
was found to be 330 for the shorter polymer and 185 for the longer
polymer. By varying the reaction time in the presence of excess BCP,
the mean number of polymer molecules attached per CNC ranged from
40 to 170. We showed that the polymer grafting of CNCs via bis-aryl
hydrazone formation is controllable, which is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first report on the controllable polymer grafting of
CNCs.

These conjugates could be covalently labeled with anionic
(Alexa
Fluor 488) or cationic (tetramethylrhodamine) dyes in such a way that
the dyes were shielded by the PEG corona of the BCPs. Importantly,
as shown, the conjugation of the dyes did not impart toxicity to the
CNCs.

This finding is significant in drug delivery applications
as manipulating
the degree of conjugation could control the loading amount of therapeutic
agents, which is in our case the radionuclide, and thus meet the different
demands of treatments.

Experimental
Materials
A suspension
of CNCs (obtained by acid hydrolysis
of wood pulp, 0.99 wt % sulfur content) was purchased from the USDA
Forest Product Laboratory (USA). The reagents and solvents are DTPA
(98%, Aldrich), EDA (Sigma-Aldrich), di-tert-butyl
dicarbonate (tBoc2O, Sigma-Aldrich), l-glutamic acid γ-benzyl ester (BLG, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-hydrazinopyridine
(Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide (28%, Sigma-Aldrich), epichlorohydrin
(99%, Fluka), N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich),
and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich). FITC (Fisher Scientific),
NHS-rhodamine (ThermoFisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 488-NHS (Alexa
Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester, Life Technologies) were
used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Water was
purified through a Milli-Q water purification system (18 MΩ
cm). All buffers were prepared
in our laboratory. DMTMM (Acros Organics, 99+%), Millipore Amicon
spin filters (15 or 4 mL, 3, 10, or 50 kDa molecular-weight cutoff
(MWCO) and 5 mL, 50 kDa) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. MeO-PEG-NH2 (M = 2000 (2K)) was purchased from Jenkem
as the HCl salt and converted to the free amine by treatment with
triethylamine. The analysis of this sample by 1H NMR (see Figure S3 below) gave a DPn = 48.
BLG-NCA was synthesized as described previously.44 Succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate (S-4FB) and succinimidyl
6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (S-HyNic) were synthesized
as described in Grotzky et al.31 4FB-acid
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. S-HyNic and S-4FB are available
commercially from Solulink, USA, www.solulink.com.

Instrumentation
TEM
Sample morphology was monitored by TEM using a
Hitachi H-7000 instrument operating at 100 kV. CNC samples were diluted
to 0.01 wt % with water, followed by sonication (50 W sonication bath,
23 °C) for 10 min. A droplet was placed onto a 200 mesh carbon–copper
grid. The excess suspension was wicked off with filter paper. Two
droplets of 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate solution was then deposited
onto the dried sample with 1 min of drying, and the excess staining
agent was removed by touching a piece of filter paper to the edge
of the TEM grid. Images were recorded using a TEM operated at a voltage
of 100 kV. TEM images were analyzed using the software ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health, USA).

Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy
UV/vis spectroscopy
was carried out on a Cary Series 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technology, USA). All time-dependent UV/vis spectra were
recorded at RT with a 70 μL UV–cuvette cell (l = 1.0 cm).

ICP-MS
ICP-MS measurements were
carried out on an ELAN
9000 (PerkinElmer) ICP/MS for 159Tb analysis. All samples
were diluted with 2% HNO3 until ppb concentrations were
obtained. The standard solutions were prepared by a series of 10-fold
dilutions of terbium standard solution (10 mg/L, 2% HNO3, PerkinElmer) in triplicate to obtain three standard solutions (0.1,
1, and 10 ppb of Tb).

Surface Modification of CNCs
Introduction
of Epoxy Groups and Their Transformation to Amine
Groups
A CNC sample (100 mL, 11.9 wt %) was diluted to 3.0
wt % with water and sonicated for 10 min at RT. Then, the suspension
was filtered through a syringe filter (0.45 μm) to remove any
aggregates. The solids content was found to be 2.65 wt % by freeze-drying
an aliquot of the filtered CNC suspension.

To introduce surface
epoxy groups, an aliquot of the filtered CNC suspension (10 mL, 2.65
wt %, 265 mg of CNC solids) was mixed with 25 mL of NaOH (1 M). This
solution was then treated with epichlorohydrin (5.8 mL, 0.28 mol/g
CNC) and heated to 60 °C.

To investigate the effect of
time on the modification efficacy,
several epichlorohydrin reactions were run in parallel according to
the above procedure and stopped at different times (0.67, 1.0, 2.0,
4.0, 6.0, or 20 h). After each given time, the reaction mixture was
centrifuged (4000 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in water multiple times
until the pH was below 12 (pH meter, Mettler Toledo).

For each
sample, immediately after the pH of the epoxy-modified
CNCs (CNC–epoxy) dropped below 12, the suspension was transferred
to a 100 mL round-bottom reaction flask. The pH of the CNC–epoxy
dispersion was adjusted to 12 with 50% (w/v) NaOH. Then, an excess
of aqueous ammonia (28%, 10 mL, 5 mL/g of cellulose) was added, and
the reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C for 3 h. Excess ammonium
hydroxide was removed by three cycles of centrifugation (12 000
rpm, 15 min)–redispersion in DI water (15 mL). The purified
amino-modified CNC suspension was then stored at 4 °C.

Quantifying
the Amine Content of CNC–NH2 with
FITC
Aliquots of CNC–NH2 (2.0 mL) were
each mixed with NaHCO3 buffer (2.0 mL, 100 mM, pH = 9.0).
Then, a solution prepared by dissolving FITC (0.5 mg, 0.32 mmol/g
CNCs) in DMF (200 μL) was added to the NaHCO3-buffered
suspensions containing CNC–NH2. The reaction mixture
was stirred overnight in the dark and then dialyzed for 5 days with
water (water was changed twice daily). When the diffusion of excess
FITC from the reaction mixture had ceased according to visual inspection
and UV/vis monitoring, the suspension was sonicated (20 min, ice-bath
cooling) and filtered through a syringe filter (0.45 μm) to
remove aggregates. The final suspension (0.5 wt %) had a pH of 6.
The amount of FITC attached to each of the CNC–NH2 samples was determined by UV/vis measurements. The pH of the CNC–NH2 samples was adjusted to 11 with NaHCO3 buffer
(100 mM). Free FITC in ammonium hydroxide (28%, pH 11) with a range
of concentrations was used to generate a calibration curve (Figure S2). The molar extinction coefficient
ε490 for FITC amide was calculated to be 5.2 ×
104 M–1 cm–1.

4FB
Modification of CNC–NH2
An aliquot
of an aqueous suspension of CNC–NH2 (7.5 mL, 66.7
mg) was mixed with PB (4.0 mL, 200 mM, pH = 8.0). A solution of S-4FB
(5.0 mg, 10 equiv to −NH2 on CNCs) in DMF (1.0 mL)
was added to the suspension. Then, the mixture was stirred for 24
h at RT. Afterward, the suspension was sonicated for 20 min with ice-bath
cooling and washed with water (4000 rpm, 10 × 15 mL) using a
MWCO 10 kDa spin filter to obtain a suspension of CNC–4FB (solid
content, 0.75 wt %).

Quantification of 4FB Groups on CNC–4FB
A suspension
of CNC–4FB (0.75 wt %) was diluted to 0.1 wt % with sodium
acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 5.0). 2-Hydrazinopyridine (4.6 mg, 0.042
mmol) was dissolved in DMF (770 μL) to make a 50 mM solution.
The CNC–4FB suspension (360 μL, 0.1 wt %) and 2-hydrazinopyridine
solution (40 μL, 50 mM) were mixed in a quartz cell (l = 1.0 cm). The absorbance of the solution was monitored
at RT by UV/vis spectroscopy (λ = 350 nm) with data points taken
automatically at 30 s intervals until absorbance appeared to reach
a plateau (Figure S20).

BCP Synthesis
and Characterization
Synthesis of mPEG-PBLG18-NH2
Methoxy(polyethylene glycol)48-poly(γ-benzyl-l-glutamate)18 was synthesized by the ring-opening
polymerization of BLG-NCA (1.2 g, 4.56 mmol) catalyzed by thiourea
(0.8 mL, 1 M) with an amine initiator MeO-PEG2k-NH2 (0.4 g, 0.2 mmol) to obtain a polymer with an amine group
at one end. The molar ratio of BLG-NCA:initiator was 22:1. The reaction
was carried out in 15 mL of DMF for 6 h at 0 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Then, the solution was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate
PEG-PBLG-NH2. The crude polymer was
dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) and reprecipitated in diethyl ether
three times. The PBLG solid was collected and dried under vacuum.
Yield = 1.31 g (82%).

with the NMR solvent peak). The degree of polymerization was calculated
by comparing the integration of the signal at 3.23 ppm (end group
−OCH3) to that at 5.03 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene),
where DPn = 18, MnNMR = 5.9 kDa; GPC (NMP, RI): MnGPC = 6.6 kDa, D̵ = 1.12.

Synthesis of mPEG-PBLG25-NH2
This polymer was synthesized following
a similar protocol as described
above. In brief, BLG-NCA (1.5 g, 5.7 mmol) and MeO-PEG2k-NH2 (0.4 g, 0.2 mmol) were used as the monomer and initiator,
respectively. The molar ratio of BLG-NCA:initiator was 28:1. No thiourea
was used for this reaction. Yield = 1.48 g (78%).

1H NMR (DMSO-d6) (Figure S5): δ (ppm, integrated peak areas reported based
on the backbone benzyl methylene group) 8.64–7.49 (br, −NH–,

= 2.60), 5.05 (m, −CH2–phenyl, 2H per monomer,
integration = 1.00), 4.33–3.79 (br, backbone methine, integration
= 0.45), 3.26 (s, −OCH3, 3H, integration = 0.06),
2.48–1.60 (m, −CH2CH2–,
4H, integration = 1.75, peak overlapped with the NMR solvent peak).
The degree of polymerization was calculated by comparing the integration
of the signal at 3.26 ppm (end group −OCH3) to that
at 5.05 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene), where DPn = 0.5/(0.06/3)
= 25, MnNMR = 7.4 kDa; GPC (NMP, RI): MnGPC = 9.1 kDa, D̵
= 1.21.

Introduction of Terminal tBoc Groups: mPEG-PBLG18-tBoc
A sample of mPEG-PBLG18-NH2 (0.78 g, 0.12 mmol) and tBoc2O (0.5 mL, 2.2 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (8.0 mL),
and the solution was stirred at RT overnight. Afterward, the solution
was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate the product. The crude
polymer was dissolved in DCM and reprecipitated in diethyl ether three
times. The mPEG-PBLG18-tBoc solid was
dried under vacuum. Yield = 0.54 g (78%).

1H NMR
(DMSO-d6) (Figure S6): δ (ppm, integrated peak areas reported based on
the backbone benzyl methylene group) 8.30–7.95 (br, backbone,
−NH–, 1H, integration = 0.37), 7.38–7.16 (m,
phenyl, 5H, integration = 2.56), 5.03 (m, −CH2–phenyl,
2H per monomer, integration = 1.00), 4.41–3.82 (br, backbone
methine, 1H, integration = 0.44), 3.23 (s, −OCH3, 3H, integration = 0.08), 2.48–1.71 (m, −CH2CH2CO–, 4H, integration = 1.80, peak overlapped
with the NMR solvent peak) 1.52–1.31 (m, t-Boc end group, 9H, integration = 0.20). The functionality of t-Boc was calculated by comparing the integration of the 1H NMR signal at 1.52–1.31 ppm (t-Boc
end group) to that at 5.03 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene), where
% t-Boc functionality = 0.20/((0.5/18) × 9)
× 100% = 80%. The degree of polymerization was determined by
comparing the integration of the peak at 3.23 ppm (end group −OCH3) to that at 5.03 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene). We found
DPn = 18, which agrees with the value calculated for mPEG-PBLG18-NH2.

mPEG-PBLG25-tBoc
This polymer
was synthesized following a similar protocol using mPEG-PBLG25-NH2 (0.99 g, 0.16 mmol) and tBoc2O (1.0 mL, 4.4 mmol) in DMF (8.0 mL). Yield = 0.82 g (83%).

(br, backbone methine, 1H per monomer, integration = 0.54), 3.23 (s,
−OCH3, 3H, integration = 0.06), 2.46–1.73
(m, −CH2CH2CO–, 4H, integration
= 1.69, peak overlapped with the solvent peak) 1.48–1.28 (m, t-Boc end group, 9H, integration = 0.17). The functionality
of t-Boc was calculated by comparing the integration
of the 1H NMR signal at 1.48–1.28 ppm (t-Boc end group) to that at 5.01 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene),
where % t-Boc functionality = 0.17/((0.5/25) ×
9) × 100% = 94%. The degree of polymerization was calculated
by comparing the integration of the peak at 3.23 ppm (end group −OCH3) to that at 5.01 ppm (backbone benzyl methylene). We found
DPn = 25, which agrees with the value calculated for mPEG-PBLG25-NH2.

Aminolysis of the PBLG

EDA
(4.0 mL, 140 mmol) was added into a NMP solution (4.0 mL) containing
mPEG-PBLG18-tBoc (100 mg, 0.23 mmol repeat
units) and 2-pyridone (2HP, 160 mg, 1.7 mmol, 7 equiv to the repeat
unit of the polymer), and the solution was stirred at 0 °C for
5 h. The reaction mixture was precipitated with diethyl ether (100
mL), and the solid was dissolved in aqueous acetic acid solution (5%
v/v). Then, this solution was washed using a MWCO 3 kDa spin filter
with sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 5.0, 4000 rpm, 3 × 15
mL) and followed by water (4000 rpm, 3 × 15 mL). Afterward, the
solution was lyophilized to obtain mPEG-P(GluEDA)18-tBoc as the acetate salt (ca. 70 mg, yield = 71%).

2.17–1.88 (br, −CH–CH2–CH2–CO–, 2H, integration = 1.87), 1.44 (s, t-Boc end group, 9H, integration = 0.41). The functionality
of surviving t-Boc was calculated by comparing the
integration of the peak at 1.44 ppm (t-Boc end group)
to that at 4.34 ppm (backbone methine), where the surviving % t-Boc functionality = 0.40/((1/18) × 9) × 100%
= 80%. The conversion of aminolysis was calculated by comparing the
integration of the residual phenyl group (7.43 ppm) to that of the
backbone methine (4.34 ppm), where the conversion of aminolysis =
(1 – 0.14/5) × 100% = 97%.

This
polymer was synthesized following a similar protocol. In brief, EDA
(12 mL, 0.4 mol) was added into a NMP solution containing mPEG-PBLG25-tBoc (0.5 g, 1.14 mmol repeat units) and
2HP (1.0 g, 10 mmol, 9 equiv to the repeat unit of the polymer). Yield
= 0.44 g (88%).

reported based on the backbone methine group) 7.33 (br, residual phenyl
group from PBLG, 5H, integration = 0.17), 4.33 (m, backbone methine,

of the peak at 1.43 ppm (t-Boc end group) to that
at 4.33 ppm (backbone methine), where % t-Boc functionality
= 0.26/(1/25 × 9) = 73%. The conversion of aminolysis was calculated
by comparing the integration of the residual phenyl group (7.33 ppm)
to that of the backbone methine (4.33 ppm), giving a conversion of
aminolysis of 97%.

Introduction of DTPA Metal Chelators
mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-tBoc
A DTPA solution (10 mL containing
2.5 g of DTPA, 6.3 mmol, 30 equiv
to each polymeric amino group, pH adjusted with 1 M NaOH to 8.5) was
mixed with a freshly prepared DMTMM solution (1.0 mL containing 150
mg of DMTMM, 4 equiv to amine groups on the polymer) in a 50 mL round-bottom
flask. The mixture was stirred for 5 min, then was poured into a mPEG-PGlu(EDA)18-tBoc solution (4.0 mL of H2O,
containing 50 mg of polymer). The reaction was stirred for 30 min
at RT. Afterward, the solution was transferred to a 15 mL MWCO 3 kDa
spin filter and washed with water (4000 rpm, 9 × 15 mL). Finally,
the solution was lyophilized to obtain mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-tBoc (65 mg, 60% yield).

(ppm, integrated peak areas reported based on the backbone methine
group) 7.43 (br, residual phenyl group from PBLG, 5H, integration

of aminolysis is 97%, which agrees with the precursor PEG-P(GluEDA)18-tBoc. The functionality of the DTPA group
was calculated by comparing the backbone methine signals to the that
of EDA associated with DTPA. Each DTPA contains 18 protons from EDA,
and the DTPA functionality = (20.76 – 4 – (1/18) ×
3)/(22 – 4) × 100% = 92%. The tBoc functionality
was calculated by comparing the tBoc signal to the
backbone methine signal, giving a t-Boc functionality
of 74%.

mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-tBoc
This polymer was synthesized following a similar protocol
as described
above using PEG-PGlu (EDA)25-tBoc (100
mg, 0.23 mmol repeat units), DTPA (3 g, 7.6 mmol, 30 equiv to each
polymeric amino group), and DMTMM (300 mg). Yield = 130 mg (65%).

9H, integration = 0.28). The conversion of aminolysis is 97%, which
agrees with the precursor PEG-PGlu(EDA)25-tBoc. The functionality of the DTPA group was calculated by comparing

DTPA. The functionality of the DTPA group = (22.37 – 4 –
(1/25) × 3)/(22 – 4) × 100% = 100%. The t-Boc functionality was calculated by comparing the tBoc signal to the backbone methine signal, giving a tBoc funcitonality of 75%.

the Amino Polymer
mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-NH2
mPEG-P(Glu-EDA-DPTA)18-tBoc
(47 mg, 0.009 mmol) was dissolved
in water (1.0 mL). TFA (1.0 mL, 13 mmol) was added, and the solution
was stirred at RT for 2 h. Afterward, the solution was diluted to
15 mL with water and washed using a 15 mL MWCO 3 kDa spin filter (4000
rpm, 8 × 15 mL). Finally, the solution was lyophilized to obtain
PEG-P(GluEDA-DPTA)18-NH2 (37 mg, 78%).

HyNic
Group Content of the Polymers
To quantify the
HyNic group content of the two BCP samples, aliquots of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic and mPEG-PGlu(DPTA)18-HyNic were reacted
with excess 4FB-acid, and the conversion was monitored in a microcuvette
cell (l = 1.0 cm) by UV/vis measurements at λ
= 354 nm, with data points taken automatically at 30 s intervals until
the absorbance appeared to reach a plateau. A solution of PEG-P(Glu-EDA-DPTA)18-HyNic (340 μM) or mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic
(190 μM) was prepared by dissolving mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-HyNic (0.8 mg, 0.068 μmol) or mPEG-PGlu(DPTA)25-HyNic (0.6 mg, 0.038 μmol) in sodium acetate buffer (200 μL,
100 mM, pH = 5.0). The 4FB-acid solution (50 mM) was prepared by dissolving
the acid (9.3 mg, 0.062 mmol) in DMSO (1.28 mL). Then, 4FB-acid solution
(50 mM) was diluted to 5 mM with sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, pH
= 5.0). The polymer-HyNic solution (50 μL) was then diluted
10-fold with the 4FB-acid solution (450 μL, 5 mM). The concentration
of polymers containing a HyNic end group ([polymer-HyNic]) was calculated
from the change in absorbance ΔA354 nm. 2  where ε354 nm is the
molar extinction coefficient of the formed bis-aryl hydrazone (BAH)
bond (ε354 nm = 29 000 M–1 cm–1)46 and l is the absorption path length of the UV–cuvette
micro cell (l = 1.0 cm). The plots of ΔA354 nm as a function of time for both diblock
copolymers are presented in Figure S16,
where we calculated a HyNic content of 73% for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)18-HyNic and 52% for mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic. The
time-evolution plots were fitted to a stretched-exponential function,
and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1.

Rhodamine-Labeled CNC–4FB
NHS-rhodamine (0.4
mg, 0.8 μmol) and S-4FB (2.8 mg, 8.0 μmol) were dissolved
in DMF (80 and 260 μL) to make 0.5 and 1 wt % solutions, respectively.
The dye is characterized by λex,max 552 nm/λem,max 575 nm, and we denote the rhodamine-labeled CNC–4FB
as Rh552–CNC–4FB. The pH of the CNC–NH2 suspension (2.4 mL, 0.83 wt %) was adjusted to 8.0 with PB
(0.5 M, pH 8.0), to which NHS-rhodamine solution (70 μL, 0.5
wt %) and S-4FB solution (240 μL, 1 wt %, 10 equiv to NHS-rhodamine
and 5 equiv to amino groups on CNCs) were added. Then, the mixture
was shaken overnight at RT. Afterward, the product was washed with
PB (0.1 M, pH 8.0) using a 4 mL MWCO 10 kDa Millipore Amicon spin
filter (4000 rpm, 6 × 4 mL), followed by water (4000 rpm, 6 ×
4 mL).

Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG
A solution of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic (330 μM) was prepared by dissolving a polymer sample
(1.6 mg, 0.10 μmol) in sodium acetate buffer (300 μL,
100 mM, pH = 5.0). Then, the Rh552–CNC–4FB
suspension (100 μL) was diluted to 0.1 wt % with sodium acetate
buffer (100 mM, pH = 5.0). The polymer solution (300 μL) and
the CNC–4FB suspension (500 μL) were mixed in a quartz
cell (l = 1.0 cm), and UV/vis absorbance values at
RT were recorded every 30 s at 354 nm until the reaction appeared
to reach a plateau (20 h).

Alexa Fluor 488 Probe Labeled
CNC–4FB
Alexa
Fluor 488-NHS (0.8 mg, 1.2 μmol) and S-4FB (4.3 mg, 12 μmol)
were each dissolved in DMF (140 and 360 μL) to make 0.5 and
1 wt % solutions, respectively. The pH of CNC–NH2 solution (3.6 mL, 0.83 wt %) was adjusted to 8.0 with PB (0.5 M,
pH 8.0), to which the Alexa Fluor 488-NHS solution (140 μL,
0.5 wt %) and S-4FB solution (360 μL, 1 wt %, 10 equiv to Alexa
Fluor 488-NHS and 5 equiv to amino groups on CNCs) were added. Then,
the mixture was shaken overnight at RT. Afterward, the suspension
was washed with PB (0.1 M, pH 8.0) using a 4 mL MWCO 10 kDa Millipore
Amicon spin filter (4000 rpm, 6 × 4 mL), followed by water (4000
rpm, 6 × 4 mL). We denote this dye-labeled CNC–4FB as
A488–CNC–4FB, noting that for this dye, .

A488–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG
A solution of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic (330 μM) was prepared by dissolving a polymer sample
(1.8 mg, 0.11 μmol) in sodium acetate buffer (350 μL,
100 mM, pH = 5.0). Then, the A488–CNC–4FB
suspension (100 μL) was diluted to 0.1 wt % with sodium acetate
buffer (100 mM, pH = 5.0). The polymer solution (300 μL) and
A488–CNC–4FB suspension (500 μL) were
mixed in a quartz cell (l = 1.0 cm). UV/vis absorbance
values at RT were recorded every 30 s at 354 nm as described above.

Parallel Syntheses of Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG Samples with Different Mean Numbers of BCPs Per CNC
UV/Vis
Measurements
A solution of mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic
(330 μM) was prepared by dissolving mPEG-PGlu(DTPA)25-HyNic (11 mg, 0.70 μmol) in sodium acetate buffer
(2 mL, 100 mM, pH = 5.0). Then, a Rh552–CNC–4FB
suspension (600 μL) was diluted to 0.1 wt % with sodium acetate
buffer (3 mL, 100 mM, pH = 5.0). The diluted Rh552–CNC–4FB
suspension (0.1 wt %) was then split into seven 500 μL portions.
One portion of CNC–4FB (500 μL) was mixed with an aliquot
of polymer solution (300 μL) in a quartz cell (l = 1.0 cm), and UV/vis absorbance values at RT were recorded every
30 s at 354 nm until it appeared to reach a plateau. At the same time,
each of the six other CNC–4FB suspensions (500 μL) was
quickly mixed with the same amount of polymer solution (300 μL)
in a quartz cell, and these reaction mixtures were placed outside
of the UV/vis spectrometer for monitoring in the dark. The reactions
were stopped at different time points ranging from 10 to 1400 min
by visually tracking the UV/vis spectrum. After each desired time,
one sample was quickly diluted with NaHCO3 buffer (500
mM, pH 9.0) to stop the reaction and later transferred into a dialysis
tube (MWCO 50 kDa, 1 mL). The dialysis was continued for 4 days against
water and further purified using a spin filter (MWCO 50 kDa, 4000
rpm, 4 × 4 mL water). The purified suspensions of Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG
were then ready for the metal loading experiment.

ICP-MS Measurements
on Metal-Loaded CNC–Polymer Conjugates
Aliquots of
each sample of Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG described in the previous paragraph were treated with
terbium acetate to create Tb–DTPA complexes. Each sample was
then analyzed by ICP-MS to determine the 159Tb content.
To prepare these terbium (159Tb)-containing CNCs, terbium
acetate hydrate (0.34 mg, 10 equiv of Tb3+ per DTPA units
of the polymer) was dissolved in ammonium acetate buffer (1 mL, 20
mM, pH 6.0) and added to each of the polymer samples described above.
Each reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterward,
each suspension was transferred into a 4 mL 50 kDa MWCO Millipore
Amicon spin filter and washed three times with Tris buffer (Tris 25
mM, NaCl 150 mM, KCl 2 mM, pH 7.4) and then with water.

All
samples were diluted with 2% HNO3 until ppb concentrations
were obtained. The dilutions were repeated in triplicate and measured
with an ELAN 9000 ICP-MS for 159Tb analysis. Three standard
solutions were prepared by a series of 10-fold dilutions of terbium
standard solution (10 mg/L, 2% HNO3, PerkinElmer) in triplicate
to obtain three standard solutions with 0.1, 1, and 10 ppb of Tb.
A blank solution (2% HNO3) was also measured in triplicate.
A linear calibration curve was obtained, relating the counts and terbium
concentration. All concentrations of terbium in ppb were obtained
from the calibration curve.

Cell Culture and MCTS Experiments
Human ovarian carcinoma
(HEYA8) cells were obtained from M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre (Houston,
TX, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and grown at 37
°C in 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity.

Evaluation
of CNC Cytotoxicity by APH Assay
Cells were
plated in 96 well plates at a density of 4000 cells/well, and treated
with Rho-CNCs or AF488-CNCs over a range of drug concentrations for
24 h. The APH assay was then used to assess cytotoxicity.57 In brief, following treatment, cells were washed
with PBS, and then, 100 μL of freshly prepared reaction buffer
(2 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1
M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5)) was added to each well. Following
2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 10 μL of 1 M sodium hydroxide
was added to each well, and the cell viability was determined by measuring
the UV absorbance at 405 nm using an automated 96 well plate reader
(SpectraMax Plus 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Cell
viability was determined by normalizing the data to controls: cell
viability (%) = Abstreatment – Absmedia/(Abscontrol – Absmedia).

MCTSs
MCTSs of HEYA8 cells were grown as previously
reported by our laboratory.57,61 Briefly, subconfluent
cells were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 2000 cells/well
onto nonadherent 96-well round-bottom Sumilon PrimeSurface spheroid
plates (MS-9096U; Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were incubated
in complete growth media at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90%
relative humidity for 4 days.

Penetration of CNCs into
MCTSs
The penetration of CNCs
labeled with rhodamine (Rh552–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG) and Alexa Fluor 488 (A488–CNC–4FB–HyNic-PGlu(DTPA)25-mPEG) was evaluated by following a previously reported method
with modifications.61 Briefly, MCTSs were
grown for 4 days until they reached a diameter of approximately 500
μm. The media (50 μL) was removed from each well and replaced
with 50 μL of media solution containing 0.0034 wt % rhodamine-CNCs
or AF488-CNCs. Following 24 h of incubation with CNCs, MCTSs were
carefully washed with PBS and then transferred onto Nalge Nunc Lab-Tek
II #1.5 German Coverglass microscopy slides for imaging. MCTSs were
imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope with a 20× objective
and Rhodamine or Alexa Fluor 488 filter for Rho-CNCs and AF488-CNCs,
respectively. Fluorescence laser gain was determined to minimize bleed-through
artifacts and was kept constant for all measurements. CNC penetration
was assessed at three different depths by obtaining optical slices
at 30, 60, and 90 μm from the MCTS surface. For each optical
slice, the fluorescence intensity per unit area was determined for
three equally spaced, concentric regions (i.e., periphery, intermediate,
and core) using a custom MATLAB algorithm (MathWorks Inc., MA, USA).
The fluorescence intensity for each region was expressed as mean ±
SD for n = 4 MCTSs.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
The statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent multiple comparisons using the
Bonferroni correction for three or more groups. p < 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.
