Determining
the time it takes a sensor to report a change in the
concentration of its target analyte may appear to be an easy task,
but it is not. The dynamic characteristic of a sensor is determined
by all components in the sensor system and the hydrodynamics of the
sample. Here, the dynamic properties of an optical pH sensor were
determined using the IUPAC-recommended activity step method in experimental
setups that can determine sensor-limited response times longer than
5 s. In order to do so, experimental setups for the injection and
for the dipping method of determining the sensor time response were
developed, tested, and shown to be able to determine time-response
curves with 1 s time resolution. This time resolution is shown to
be sufficient for determining dynamic characterization of this optical
pH sensor. The sensor chemistry-limited time-response curves were
analyzed using curve fitting. It was found that the optode response
time is limited by diffusion of protons within the sensor material
when the proton concentration is reduced and limited by diffusion
from the bulk to the boundary layer at the optode surface when proton
concentration is increased. The latter is dependent on the magnitude
of the change in analyte concentration and cannot be reported as a
single response time. The investigation of the time response of the
optical pH sensor reveals detailed information of the sensor chemistry,
but does not yield a single response time of the sensor capable of
describing the dynamic sensor characteristics of the optical pH sensor
system.

Introduction
Development of pH sensors
started in the beginning of the 20th
century when the Danish chemist Sørensen defined pH.1 He further described two methods to determine
pH: the electrometric and the colorimetric.1 Based on the discovery of the membrane properties of glass, an electrode
sensitive to protons was developed.2−4 A commercial pH meter
was launched after 25 years of engineering.5 The colorimetric pH determination is based on indicator dyes, and
the most successful commercialization is indicators immobilized on
paper.6,7 Development of fiber optics, photo diodes,
and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has provided the means for a second
implementation of the colorimetric method.8 During the last 40 years, optical pH sensors have been developed,9,10 yet only few are commercialized.11 The
challenges for optical sensors are that they require a robust sensor
dye that does not photobleach and an inert matrix material in which
the sensor dye is robustly immobilized yet still has fast diffusion
of protons in and out of the material.12−15 We have recently reported a new
optical pH sensor,16,17 but as the technology is still
emerging, characterization of pH measurements based on the colorimetric
method is difficult. This is in stark contrast to pH measurements
based on the electrometric method for which standards have been established
by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).18−20

When developing new sensors, the dynamic characteristics must
be
the first to be determined. This is the natural order, as the dynamic
characteristics are fundamental to all static characteristics.21−23 The most important dynamic characteristic is the response of the
sensor to an input change, often given as the response time. While
standard procedures exist for electrodes,19,24,25 analogue methods for optodes seem to be
nonexistent. We recently discussed the dynamic characterization of
optical sensors.23 Here, we benchmark the
response of a pH optode against a commercial pH electrode.17,23 We recently described our optimized sensor chemistry for determining
pH,17 with pH responsive diazaoxa-triangulenium
(DAOTA) dye covalently linked in an ORMOSIL matrix.16,17,26−28 The change in the fluorescence
intensity of the responsive DAOTA emitter is converted into an optical
sensor signal with reference to the emission from a nonresponsive
dye.

Addressing and reading the sensor chemistry is done using
custom-built
hardware that reports both the sensor signal and full emission spectra.17 Here, only the sensor signal is used to investigate
the time-response of an optical pH sensor.

The response of chemical
sensors can be limited by all parts of
the sensor system, see Figure 1A.16,17,23,29−31 If all hardware components
are fast, the response is determined by the sensor chemistry or by
the mass transport of the target analyte in the sensor chemistry.
Minimizing the influence of mass transport requires development of
an experimental method that enables a change in the target analyte
activity at the sensor that is as instantaneous as physically possible,
or at least significantly faster than the sensor response itself.
To probe the hydrodynamic parameters of the setup, time-response curves
recorded with fast-responding commercial pH electrodes were used.
With a setup with a fast analyte change and a hardware that enables
rapid sampling, the contribution of the sensor chemistry to the time-response
can be investigated.19

setup consisting of an optical sensor
spot (optode) immobilized in front of an optical probe, fibre optical
connectors, hardware encasing a fibre-spectrometer detector, and an
LED light source. (B,C) Experimental setup for recording time-response
data using the activity step method. (B) The injection method where
electrode and optode responses can be recorded simultaneously. (C)
The dipping method (here shown with an electrode).

Figure 1 shows the
two methods developed for investigating the sensor response.19,24,32,33 The injection method, shown in Figure 1B, alters the composition of a single solution,32 while the dipping method, shown in Figure 1C, takes the sensor
from one solution to a second.33 In either
method, the sensor responds to an induced activity step change.19,23 Here, both methods are used to compare the response properties of
an optical pH sensor with those of commercial pH electrodes. Using
a single magnitude of the activity step, the limiting hydrodynamic
conditions were determined. Using the ideal hydrodynamic conditions,
the sensor chemistry-limited time response was determined with a resolution
of 1 s and setup defined response time determination limits of 5 s
(dipping method) and 20 s (injection method).

By investigating
the influence of the magnitude of the activity
step on the time-response of the optical sensor, the limiting transport
processes were identified. For pH electrodes, the previously reported
response mechanism was confirmed that is response limited by diffusion
from the bulk solution to the electrode surface through a stagnant
film.23 The data showed that the response
of the pH optode is limited by two different forms of transport depending
on the direction of the activity step. For increasing pH, diffusion
within the matrix material is the response limiting process. While
for decreasing pH, diffusion from the bulk solution to the optode
surface is the limiting process. The results demonstrate the need
for a systematic approach when determining response times of chemosensors
and clearly indicate which parameters can be optimized when engineering
a faster sensor response.

Results and Discussion
Determination
of dynamic sensor properties requires careful design
of the experimental method. The workflow used to optimize the experimental
setup was recently discussed in great detail.23 Robust determination of time-response curves is a prerequisite for
investigating dynamic sensor characteristics determined by the sensor
chemistry.19,34 In the following, the experimental
parameters are investigated to ensure that the response-limiting component
of the chemosensors is the sensor chemistry.

Response Curve Analysis
For optical chemosensors, the
first important parameter to consider is the activity step used to
determine the time-response curve.23 The
pH optode has an operational range of 3 pH units centered at its characteristic
pKa-value of the responsive dye which
in this case is 6.1. For setup development, an activity step of 2
pH units (i.e. a 100-fold change in [H+]) centered at the
pKa-value was chosen. This corresponds
to the pH change between 5.1 and 7.1. All response curves were recorded
in a 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer
system, which has a pKa-value of 6.15
resulting in an optimal overlap between the buffer region of high
buffer capacity and the operational range of the sensor.

Figure 2 shows representative
normalized time-response curves for optodes and electrodes recorded
for pH decrease or increase by 2 pH units. The response curves contain
error, σ, determined as ∼2.5% for optodes and ∼0.5%
for electrodes. Thus, the response times for optodes and electrodes
should be determined as tα with
α < 97.5% and α < 99.5%, respectively.23 The optical signal output from the optode was
determined as the fluorescence intensity ratio between the pH responsive
dye and the reference dye,17 and the signal
output from the electrodes is the open circuit potential. Time-response
curves are the signal output, S, plotted as a function
of time, t.19,23,35 A first order empirical model was used for curve fitting analysis
of the time-response curves using the following equation23,36 1  where S is the sensor
signal
changing from S0 to S∞, and subscripts 0 and ∞ denoting initial
and final steady-state signal values. td is the delay time, which is defined as the length of time between
introduction of the input change of the operator and the first significant
effect of the input change seen in the output, thereby including both
dead time and lag time, see ref (23). k is the rate constant defined
as 1/τ, where τ is the time taken to obtain a signal conversion
of ∼63%.

Figure 2 Selected normalized time-response curves for optodes (olive)
and
electrodes (blue) showing signal outputs, S, as a
function of time. Top: pH decrease from 7.1 to 5.1. Bottom: pH increase
from 5.1 to 7.1. (·) Experimental data (—) curve fit using eq 1.

For optodes, Figure 2 shows that 90% of the response (t90)
has occurred after approx. 20 and 60 s for pH decrease and increase,
respectively. Similar t90-values for electrodes
are 5 s. As shown in Figure 2, response data were recorded long enough to ensure that the
steady-state signal could be determined with high confidence. Each
steady-state value was determined at 5 × t90, which corresponds to a signal conversion α of >99.99%
using the model described by eq 1.23

Prior to curve fitting
analysis, all time-response curves were
normalized against the steady-state signal output using the following
procedure: The baseline was calculated by averaging the data points
recorded before the activity step change and the steady-state signal
was calculated by averaging all data points recorded after 3 × t90. This corresponds to a signal conversion
α of ∼99.9% using the model in eq 1. That is, the steady-state signal was evaluated
from data sampled beyond 99.9% conversion. In this time interval,
any change due to the activity step change will be within the error
σ. Note that within the given level of σ, drift was not
detected.23

The curve fitting analysis
using eq 1 is suitable
for determining the dynamic properties
of the pH optode and the pH electrodes. All time-response curves and
corresponding curve fits are included in the Supporting Information.

Influence of Experimental Conditions
Attention to experimental
conditions is crucial if useful and reliable time-response curves
are to be obtained. Time-response curves from systematic data analysis
may reveal the properties of the sensor chemistry. Table 1 highlights this by compiling
time-response information from commercial pH optodes and from optical
pH sensors reported in the literature. As the experimental conditions
in all cases are different—and in most cases only partially
described—comparing the reported information is difficult.
We may tentatively conclude that the pH optode investigated here has
a response time similar to or lower than that of other optical sensors
based on fluorescence. However, to compare the performance of the
sensor chemistries, more attention must be given to the experimental
conditions.

The conditions
described in the experimental section are those
used for determining the activity step dependence, and these have
been carefully optimized. However, both of the IUPAC recommended methods
have their limitations: the response time determined by the injection
method is limited by the homogenization time and hydrodynamic conditions,
which may influence the first part of the time-response curve.23 But because the position of the electrode/optode
remains unchanged, the method is excellent for determining whether
a response is instantaneous. When using the dipping method, the data
points collected during the period where the electrode/optode is moved
between samples interrupt the continuity of the time-response curve,
and rejection of these data may be required. Hence, judging whether
a response is instantaneous relies on how fast the switch between
reservoirs can be performed. Here, this time was 2–3 s. To
illustrate possible pitfalls, examples on how the hydrodynamic conditions
influence the time-response curves must be discussed.

Figure 3 shows time-response
curves from pH optodes and pH electrodes following a pH decrease from
7.1 to 5.1 using the injection method. The curves in the center and
bottom panel of Figure 3 were recorded at a very slow agitation speed (50 rpm). When injection
of acid is carried out far from the optode (i.e. the bottom of the
reservoir), delay times of 30–40 s were observed, see Figure 3 bottom panel. When
acid is injected in vicinity of the optode/electrode (i.e. in the
same depth as the optode/electrode tip), fluctuations in the sample
solution result in a signal overshoot, see Figure 3 central panel. Such curves are not suitable
for response time analysis and should be avoided. The conclusion is
that injection far from the optode/electrode and close to the agitator
provides acceptable homogenization of the sample solution before the
effect of the activity change is sensed, thereby ensuring monotonous
time-response curves suitable for determination of response times.

Figure 3 Normalized
time-response curves for optodes (left; olive) and electrodes
(right; blue) recorded under different hydrodynamic conditions for
pH decrease from 7.1 to 5.1. Bottom: delay time observed when using
the injection method with a very low agitation speed (50 rpm), and
injection far from the electrode/optode. Center: overshoot when using
the injection method with a very low agitation speed (50 rpm) and
injection in the proximity of the electrode/optode. Top: increased
error when using a high agitation speed (900 rpm) which induces bubbles
that disturb the measurement.

High speed agitation, however, may also result in inadequate
time-response
curves, as seen in the top panel of Figure 3. Agitation at 900 rpm generates bubbles
that lead to unstable hydrodynamic conditions. The effect is most
prominent for the optode, where bubbles build up on the surface of
the optode disturbing the measurement, but the effect was also observed
in the response of the pH electrode, where an increased σ is
observed (see the Supporting Information).

Another important parameter to consider when using the injection
method is the injection speed relative to the time resolution of the
experiment. Figure 4 shows two time-response curves for a glass pH electrode recorded
at a high agitation speed (600 rpm) providing fast homogenization
and thereby a fast sensor chemistry-limited response. The hardware
has a time resolution of 1 s, and injection was performed at two different
rates: 20 and 100 mL/min. Using a volume of 4 mL 1 M HCl, the injections
are completed within 12 and 2.4 s, respectively. Figure 4 shows that a response is observed
for both rates of injection after a delay time of approx. 5 s, but
that the response is markedly slower for injection at 20 mL/min. The
time-response is almost linear and is identical to the rate of injection.
Careful analysis of the result reveals that the electrode response
is fast in this case and the limiting factor is the rate of injection.
As the object of study is the sensor and the sensor chemistry of the
pH optode in particular, the rate of injection-introduced artefact
is a problem, and we must conclude that in the injection method the
injection must be completed within a time period shorter than the
time resolution of the experiment (1 s). Thus, the experimental setup
must be optimized for agitation speed, positions of sensors and injection,
and speed of injection if reliable time-response curves are to be
determined with the injection method.

Figure 4 Normalized time-response curves for a
glass electrode recorded
at a high agitation speed (600 rpm) with a time resolution of 1 s.
Injection was performed at two different rates: 20 (▲) and
100 mL/min (●). A linear tangent was fitted to the first part
of the time-response curve recorded with 20 mL/min as a guide for
the eye.

At agitation speeds <400 rpm,
it was observed that time-response
curves recorded from electrodes were susceptible to overshoots, as
seen in the central panel of Figure 3. Overshoots occurred even if the injection was carried
out far from the tip of the electrode. The susceptibility towards
an overshoot is a result of the fast electrode response, see Figure 2. Slower responding
bulk sensors i.e., the pH optode studied here, are less susceptible
to overshoots. Therefore, we investigated the effect of agitation
on the time-response curves using different setups for the slower
optodes and the fast electrodes.

For a slower optical pH sensor,
the injection was carried out in
vicinity of the pH optode, see the detailed setup in Supporting Information Figure S1, and time-response curves Figures S2–S4, S9–S11, and S14–S16. A series of time-response curves recorded at different agitation
speeds for a pH decrease from 7.1 to 5.1 is shown in Figure 5a. Response times evaluated
as t90, are plotted as a function of agitation
speed in Figure 5c.

(left; olive) and the pH electrodes (right; blue). (A,B): normalized
time-response curves recorded at different agitation speeds for a
pH decrease from 7.1 to 5.1. Injection is performed in vicinity of
the optode (A), but at the bottom of the reservoir for the electrode
(B) to avoid an overshoot. (C,D): response time evaluated as t90 plotted against the agitation speed for the
pH decrease (on; ▲) and pH increase (off; ●).

For the fast sensors, fast injection
(100 mL/min) was carried out
in vicinity of the agitator (see the detailed setup in Supporting Information Figure S1 and time-response
curves in Figures S5, S6, S12, S13, S17, S18). A series of time-response curves recorded at different agitation
speeds of a pH electrode for a pH decrease from 7.1 to 5.1 are shown
in Figure 5b. Response
times evaluated as t90 are plotted as
a function of agitation speed, see Figure 5d.

In either case, an increase in the
response time was observed when
decreasing the agitation speed. For the fast electrochemical sensors,
a time resolution of 1 s was used. Although the overshoot was avoided
by injection close to the agitator, a significant delay time was observed,
∼40 s at 50 rpm. The delay time decreases with increasing agitation
speeds and settles at ∼5 s for agitation speeds higher than
200 rpm. A slower colorimetric sensor was investigated with a time
resolution of 5 s. Here, the injection close to the agitator resulted
in no significant delay time.

The critical setup parameters,
agitation speed and the duration
and position of the injection, are summarized in Table 2. Within the experimentally
determined values, the dynamic sensor properties can be determined
from the curve fitting.23 These are included
in Table 2. Using the
injection method to induce a pH decrease, both pH optodes and pH electrodes
are characterized by a response time of t90∼20 s. However, for a pH increase the optode response is slower,
while the electrode response is unchanged. To rationalize this observation,
we need to look at the influence of the magnitude of the activity
step.

Elucidating
Physical Processes Involved in the Response
With the optimized
setup, the influence of the size of the activity
step magnitude on the response of the sensors was investigated. The
response times given as t90 were determined
by curve fitting analysis using eq 1 (see Figures S9–S18). Figure 6 shows
the correlation between t90 and the magnitude
of the activity step for the two experimental methods. A comparison
shows that t90-values determined using
the injection method are typically 10–20 s higher than those
determined by the dipping method. This is a general trend for both
optodes and electrodes, and it is particularly pronounced for high
activity steps, where the injection volume is large. As the data analysis
takes delay time into account, this indicates the presence of a setup
induced time delay of ∼15 s, originating from the mixing process
that will be present in any geometry where pH is adjusted by adding
acid or base to a stirred solution.

Figure 6 Response time t90 for optodes (olive)
and electrodes (blue) measured by the injection method (●)
and the dipping method (▲), and plotted as a function of the
magnitude of the activity step a0/a∞.

By analyzing the data in Figure 6, we concluded that the setup clearly limits
the response
time that can be ascribed to the sensor, and that this limiting behavior
for each method is reflected directly by the fast responding electrodes.
Thus, the sensor related response times that can be determined must
be slower than ∼5 s for the dipping and ∼20 s for the
injection method. Hence, we can conclude (i) that the activity change
experienced by the sensor for each method is completed within 5 and
20 s, respectively, and (ii) that the sensor chemistry-limited response
time, t90, is less than 5 s for the electrodes
used in this study in both directions of the activity step.

Further characterization of the response of the glass electrodes
will require a flow system,34 analogue
to the methods described in references,52,53 and subsequently
a higher data readout frequency (the pH meter used only allows one
readout every second).

All response times determined for optodes,
given as t90, exceed 5 s. Thus, all time-response
curves recorded
for optodes using the dipping method are limited by the sensor chemistry.
With the injection method, optode response times exceeding 20 s are
only observed for activity steps where log(a0/a∞) > −1, meaning
that time-response curves recorded using this method will contain
method-induced contributions when log(a0/a∞) ≤ −1, that
is, in all experiments where pH is decreased.

For the optodes,
the fastest response was observed when pH was
decreased (proton activity increased). The response of increased pH
was significantly slower (proton activity decreased). This suggests
that two different processes, as outlined in Figure 7, control the response.

Figure 7 Diffusion routes of protons
at the interface between the optode
and the sample solution through an unstirred boundary layer. The rate-limiting
processes are indicated.

When the proton activity is increased (log(a0/a∞) < 0), the
response
time decreases with increasing activity step, indicating a diffusion
controlled response. That is, diffusion of protons within the boundary
layer covering the optode surface limits the time-response of the
optode response. In this case, the driving force is the [H+]-gradient, which is controlled by the activity step size. It was
found that the diffusion model described in ref (25) was able to describe all
36 time-response curves for activity steps with increased proton activity
(three optodes, each six different activity steps, two methods, see Figures S19–S24) with a single response
parameter, k 2  where D is the mean diffusion
coefficient and δ is the thickness of the boundary layer, see
the Supporting Information for details.
This value was determined, k = 0.06 ± 0.01 s–1. The result is included in Figure 6 (olive dashed; left panel).

When the
proton activity is decreased (log(a0/a∞) > 0), the response
time was observed to be independent of the activity step size, and
diffusion of protons within the organic phase of the optode is controlling
the response speed.54 It was found that
the diffusion model described in ref (54) was able to describe all 36 time-response curves
for activity steps with decreased proton activity (three optodes,
each six different activity steps, two methods, see Figures S19–S24) with a single response parameter, k = 0.027 ± 0.006 s–1. The result
is included in Figure 6 (olive dashed; right panel).

Having identified the response
limiting processes directly informs
how the response time can be minimized. For a rapid response when
the pH increases, the thickness of the sensor material film must be
reduced, while a rapid response when the pH decreases can be achieved
by minimizing the boundary layer thickness. The latter can be achieved
by minimizing the surface tension of the sensor matrix, for example,
by surface functionalization.

Conclusions
The
dynamic sensor properties of an optical pH sensor were determined.
By recording time-response curves under varying hydrodynamic conditions,
an experimental setup was developed and experimental parameters were
optimized to ensure that the sensor response is determined by the
properties of the sensor chemistry. The experimental setup developed
here is able to determine sensor limited response times higher than
20 s for the injection method and higher than 5 s for the dipping
method to determine the time-response of chemosensors. This is sufficient
to investigate the time-response of most optical sensors.

The
dynamic characteristics of the optical pH sensor based on a
polysiloxane–polyethylene glycol composite polymer with a pH
responsive triangulenium dye reveal that the sensor has a response
time of t90 = 71 ± 12 s when the
pH is increased, and that the response varies with the magnitude of
the activity step when the pH is decreased (average t90 = 22 ± 5 s). The difference was rationalized using
two models for the mass transport of protons. The models differ in
the type of rate limiting mass transport: For the pH increase, the
response time is limited by diffusion of protons within the sensor
material. For a pH decrease, the response time is determined by the
thickness of the boundary layer on the optode.

We conclude that
the detailed studies as the ones described here
are not only necessary if we are to compare sensor performance, but
also reveal important properties of the sensor chemistry and provide
the information needed for informed sensor optimization.

Materials and
Methods
MES monohydrate and MES sodium salt were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich
in analytical grade (>99.0%). Deionized water was used without
further
purification.

Preparation of Sample Solutions
All measurements were
carried out in sample solutions containing 0.020 M MES buffer. Two
stock solutions containing 0.020 M MES were prepared from MES monohydrate
(buffer A) and MES sodium salt (buffer B), respectively. pH values
of the two solutions were 4.2 and 7.8. Sample solutions containing
0.020 M MES at different pH values ranging from pH 4.2 to 7.8 were
prepared by mixing buffer A and buffer B in different ratios. Sample
solutions containing 0.020 M MES at pH values outside the 4.2–7.8
range were prepared from pure solutions of either buffer A or buffer
B, respectively, titrated with 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH.

Optical pH
Sensor
The fabrication of sensor spots is
described elsewhere.16,17 Each sensor spot was glued to
the outside tip of an injection molded polycarbonate sheath using
a transparent UV-curing glue (UV adhesive U305, Cyberbond Europe GmbH),
see Figure 1A. A home-built
hardware setup was used in the experiments.17 A blue-green LED (505 nm, NSPE310S, Nichia) was used as the light
source. The light was filtered using a 550 nm short-pass filter (Omega
Optical) before it was coupled to a QR600-7-VIS125BX optical probe
(Ocean Optics). The polycarbonate sheath was placed over the optical
probe centering the tip of the probe 3 mm above the sensor spot. The
fluorescence light emitted from the sensor spot was collected through
the QR600-7-VIS125BX optical probe (Ocean Optics) and guided into
the fiber spectrometer (FREEDOM vis-NIR, Ibsen Photonics) through
a 560 nm long-pass filter (Omega Optical). An automated software routine
allowed a readout of 12 fluorescence spectra per minute.

pH-Meters
Two pH-meters (Mettler-Toledo Seven Compact)
were used to measure pH. The pH meters were equipped with two different
pH electrodes (a Mettler-Toledo, InLab Micro Pro and a Mettler-Toledo,
InLab Expert Pro) both with a diameter of 5 mm and a surface area
of ∼40 mm2. The pH electrodes were calibrated using
a series of four standard technical buffer solutions at pH 2.00, 4.01,
7.00, and 10.00 (NIST traceable, Mettler-Toledo, InLab solutions).

Recording Time-Response Curves Using the Injection Method
The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1B. A bar magnet (length 30 mm, 6 mm Ø) was placed in a 450 mL crystallization bowl (115
mm Ø, height 65 mm), hereafter denoted as the
reservoir. Then, 250 mL sample solution was transferred to the reservoir
creating a liquid column with a height of 27 mm. The reservoir was
placed on a magnetic stirrer, and agitation at 500 rpm was applied
unless otherwise stated. A black table was placed above the reservoir
to shield the sample solution from changes in ambient light. pH electrodes
and optodes were immersed into the reservoir through the black table
40 mm from the vortex centre with an angle of 90° with respect
to the liquid surface and positioned with the tip 10 mm beneath the
surface. The electrodes and optodes were allowed to pre-equilibrate
for 10 min.

Recording time-response curves of optodes: After
pre-equilibration, data were recorded for at least 3 min before an
aliquot of either 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH was injected. A small volume
of HCl or NaOH was injected from a 20 mL syringe equipped with Teflon
tubing (0.5 mm Ø), 40 mm from the vortex centre
and 1 cm below the surface of the sample solution using a syringe
pump (KDS, Legato 100) with a speed of 30 mL/min, see the Supporting Information for details. Maximum injection
duration was 8 s. The temperature was recorded simultaneously using
the pH meters. The temperature was constant within 0.2 °C throughout
each experiment. Optical signals were read out every 5 s (tres,O = 5 s). The experiment was stopped after
recording data for at least 5 times t90.

Recording time-response curves of electrodes: After pre-equilibration,
data were recorded for at least 1.5 min before an aliquot of either
1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH was injected from a 50 mL syringe equipped with
Teflon tubing (0.5 mm Ø). HCl/NaOH was injected
through an inlet tube at the solution surface, see the Supporting Information for details. The inlet
tube was positioned 20 mm from the vortex centre with an opening (5
mm Ø) at the bottom of the reservoir. Injection
was performed using a syringe pump (KDS, Legato 100) with a speed
of 100 mL/min. Maximum injection duration was 2.4 s. The temperature
was recorded simultaneously with the electric potential on the pH
meters. The temperature was constant within 0.2 °C throughout
each experiment. Optical signals were read out every second (tres,E = 1 s). The experiment was stopped after
recording data for at least 5 times t90.

Recording the Response Using the Dipping Method
The
experimental setup is shown in Figure 1C. Two sample solutions consisting of 0.02 M MES buffer
with different pH values corresponding to the activity step change
were prepared: A bar magnet (length 20 mm, 6 mm Ø) was placed in a crystallization bowl (95 mm Ø, height 55 mm), hereafter denoted the reservoir. Then, 200 mL sample
solution was transferred to the reservoir creating a liquid column
with a height of 30 mm. Two reservoirs were placed on magnetic stirrers,
and agitation at 500 rpm was applied (IKA C-Mag HS7). A black table
was placed above the reservoir to shield the sample solution from
changes in ambient light that may interfere with the optical signals.
pH electrodes and optodes (as described above) were immersed into
the reservoir through the black table 20 mm from the vortex centre
with an angle of 90° with respect to the liquid surface and positioned
with the tip 15 mm beneath the surface. The electrodes and optodes
were allowed to pre-equilibrate for 10 min in the first buffer solution.
Hereafter, data were recorded for at least 3 min before the sensors
were rapidly removed from the first buffer solution and immediately
immersed into the second buffer solution. This procedure did not take
more than 3 s. The temperature was recorded using the pH meters, and
was constant within 0.1 °C throughout the experiment. Electric
potentials were read out every second (tres,E = 1 s) and optical signals were read out every 5
s (tres,O = 5 s). The
experiment was stopped after recording data for at least 5 × t90.
