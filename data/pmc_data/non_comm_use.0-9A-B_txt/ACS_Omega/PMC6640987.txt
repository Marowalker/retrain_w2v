We synthesized a novel bis-azide
low-band gap cross-linkable molecule
N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] with wide absorption.
This compound is of interest as an additive in polymer/fullerene bulk
heterojunction solar cells. In addition to providing efficient thermal
stabilization of the morphology, the additive can harvest additional
solar light compared with pristine poly(3-hexyl thiophene) to improve
the power-conversion efficiency (PCE). The additional donor material
was visualized from the appearance of additional external quantum
efficiency contributions between 650 and 800 nm. An open-circuit voltage
increase of ∼2% compensates the decrease in the short-circuit
current of ∼2% to achieve a fully thermally stabilized PCE
of 3.5% after 24 h of annealing at 150 °C.

Introduction
Bulk heterojunction
organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have attracted
a considerable amount of attention in recent years owing to their
potential of providing efficient,1 lightweight,2 and low-cost manufacturing3 through roll-to-roll coating and inkjet printing on flexible
substrates. To be commercialized, ideal organic solar cells should
present a constant performance of efficiency and durability, ascribed
to a stable morphology. Breaking the 10% efficiency barrier in organic
photovoltaic OSCs has been achieved for BHJ architectures based on
conjugated polymers and small molecules with fullerene combinations
after being a target over the last 2 decades.1,4 Although,
this efficiency still lags behind that of inorganic solar cells, it
makes them very promising and potential candidates for future renewable
energy needs. The key points that provide this significant enhancement
are optimized design strategies, synthetic protocols, and device fabrication
procedures.5,6 Various fabrication techniques,
such as solution processing by changing the spin-coated solvent7 or incorporating a solvent additive8 as well as postprocessing treatment: thermal
annealing9 or solvent annealing,10 were essential to improve the solar cell efficiency.
This was based on controlling the ordering of the π-conjugated
materials in the solid state and nanophase segregation between the
donor and acceptor materials within an exciton diffusion length scale
of ∼10 nm.11 However, the active
layer (AL) is susceptible to degradation: a phase separation occurs
between its components after aging.12 The
formation of micron-sized phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PC61BM) crystals disrupts the ordering of the molecules
and will negatively affect the charge diffusion, separation, and transport.
This directly results
in a huge drop in the power-conversion efficiency (PCE).13 To address this limitation and suppress the
crystallization of PCBM, cross-linkable groups incorporated on electron
donor materials,14−18 acceptors,19−22 and small molecules23,24 were reported, offering a locked
and long-term thermally stable morphology. In parallel, two research
groups recently turned their attention toward developing an innovative
strategy to control the morphology and stability in one step. In this
context, two dual functional additives were synthesized, with either
a bifunctional azide cross-linker, such as 1,10-diazidodecane25 and 1,6-diazidohexane (DAZH),26 or a trifunctional azide cross-linker, such as tris(4-(5′-(3-azidopropyl)-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)phenyl)amine
(TBT-N3),27 and incorporated
into BHJ-OSCs. The dual functional behaviour of the additives resulted
in the improvement of the photovoltaic performances and a retention
of high PCE after prolonged thermal aging. On the basis of a similar
concept, incorporating an additional donor material into binary BHJ-OSCs
could broaden the absorption range and therefore increase the short-circuit
current (Jsc). We found that it is highly
desirable to design new molecular architectures of dual function additives
that can readily add to the spectral absorption besides their role
in stabilization of the morphology. Therefore, an ideal solar cell
device with enhanced efficiency and stability could be commercialized.

Herein, we present a description of the synthetic pathway utilized
by us to insert a cross-linkable azide function into molecular donor
4-4′-bis(undecane)dicyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-bis(5-fluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (CPDT(FBTTh2)2, with a modular (D1-A–D2-A–D1) architecture. Molecules with a similar structure have a
good performance in organic solar cells, as previously reported.28,29 The dual additive effect is demonstrated when the compounds are
incorporated into the well-known poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT):PC61BM system.24 Through primary optimization
of the photovoltaic performance, the OPV cells show a PCE of 3.5%,
which drops to 0.5% upon aging at 150 °C for 24 h. However, incorporation
of an additive with a ratio of 0.2 wt/wt is sufficient to fully stabilize
the efficiency after aging, where an additional external quantum efficiency
(EQE) peak between 650 and 750 nm partially overcomes the loss of
short-circuit current (Jsc) caused by
the additive (50% of the drop is recovered by the additional EQE peak).
Indeed, this new class of cross-linkable additives is promising for
integration into organic solar cells, inducing thermally stable and
highly efficient devices.

Results and Discussion
Two synthetic
pathways have been utilized in this study to substitute
the 4,4′-position of CPDT with a linear alkyl chain bearing
different functional groups (N3, Br) to achieve a CPDT-based
molecule in fewer steps33 (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information). Several
attempts were made to stannylate such molecules, without any success.
Despite selective lithiation at the α-position with n-BuLi, the reactivity of the functional groups leads to
cyclization of the alkyl chain within the aromatic ring, and degradation
of the molecules was observed. For the above-mentioned reasons, it
was necessary to develop an alternative and efficient route for obtaining
stable functionalized alkylated CPDT upon stannylation. A tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBDMS)-protected undecyl
bromine chain (1) was chosen to ensure stability of the
alcohol functional group (OH), which can be converted into azide functionality
upon designing the final molecule and the long alkyl chain (C11) to increase the solubility. An overview of all synthetic
steps for the synthesis of N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] is presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Strategy for N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] (6)
First, an efficient route was developed for obtaining
TBDMS-functionalized
CPDT (2) using KOH in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a
catalytic amount of KI. Then, selective lithiation at the α-position
and stannylation with trimethyltin chloride provided molecule 3 in a high yield (99%). Thereafter, the D1-A–D2-A–D1 structure of the [CPDT(FBTTh2)2] molecule (4) was synthesized via a microwave-assisted
Stille cross-coupling reaction using 4-bromo-5-fluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (D1-A), molecule 3, and Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalytic system at
an elevated temperature in chlorobenzene. Furthermore, deprotection
of the TBDMS group of molecule 4 was performed in acidified
tetrahydrofuran (THF) using HCl. After each step, [CPDT(FBTTh2)2] molecules 4 and 5 were purified by washing with copious amounts of methanol and ethanol
and then carrying out silica gel column chromatography. Finally, direct
conversion of the alcohol to the azide was achieved via a one-step
azidation reaction, according to a previously reported procedure,34,35 that used diphenylphosphoryl azide, di-tert-butylazidocarboxylate
(DIAD), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) in anhydrous THF
under an inert atmosphere. The azidated molecule was recovered after
precipitation in methanol and found to contain 85% of azidated side
chains.

The chemical structures of the [CPDT(FBTTh2)2] molecules were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS), and IR spectroscopy,
and their purity was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Figure 1 shows
a superposition of the 1H NMR spectra of TBDMS (4)-, OH (5)-, and N3 (6)-functionalized
[CPDT (FBTTh2)2]. In these spectra, the end
groups were identified by their chemical shifts and splitting patterns.
The spectrum of TBDMS–[CPDT(FBTTh2)2]
showed all of the characteristic signals of [CPDT(FBTTh2)2] and two additional signals (a and b) at 0.88 and 0.01
ppm (CH3, s), corresponding to the methyl protons of the
TBDMS-protected group. Total deprotection
was confirmed from the OH–[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] spectrum, where the methyl proton signals of TBDMS completely disappeared
and the signal corresponding to the methylene proton’s (c)
neighboring oxygen atom was shifted from 3.52 to 3.55 ppm. Finally,
successful insertion
of the azide functional group was confirmed by the shift in the methylene
signal of the neighboring alcohol (d) from 3.55 to 3.17 ppm. Comparing
the integration of protons, (e) 2.8 ppm, corresponding to four protons
and (f) 3.17 ppm, corresponding to protons of methylene adjacent to
the azide moiety, a maximum conversion of greater than 85% was calculated.
The conversion value obtained is acceptable and similar to that in
previously reported studies that used direct conversion of alcohol
into azide.34,35 Although the unreacted OH derivative
(5) could not be eliminated after several attempts, confirmed
by HPLC, this should not affect the performances because the OH residue
in itself could be an interesting functionality that enhances the
stability of organic solar cells when inserted into the CPDT alkyl
chain.36

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz, CDCl3) of TBDMS
(4)-, OH (5)-, and N3 (6)-functionalized [CPDT(FBTTh2)2].

MALDI-TOF analysis and IR spectroscopy
were used to confirm the
successful insertion of azide functionality (Figures S8 and S10). First, the calculated exact masses of molecules 4, 5, and 6 were in agreement with
the obtained MALDI mass spectra. The exact molar mass of N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] was clearly identified by
the signal at 1368.5 g mol–1. In addition, a characteristic
dinitrogen loss detected at 1341.5 g mol–1 definitively
confirmed the presence of the azide moiety.

Second, infrared
(IR) spectroscopy probes the alteration of end
functionalization of [CPDT (FBTTh2)2] (Figure S10). After removal of the TBDMS protecting
group, a broad absorption feature associated with OH-band stretching
(νOH = 3500–3700 cm–1) could
be identified. The formation of the azide functionality was visualized
from the complete disappearance of the OH group and appearance of
an asymmetric characteristic vibration of azide (νN3 = 2090 cm–1). The characteristic
IR stretching vibration of azide at 2090 cm–1 was
reduced to 8% of the original signal after thermal treatment at 150
°C for 10 min in the presence of PCBM, indicating an almost complete
reaction of the azide group (Figure S12).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry
(DSC) were used to probe the stability and thermal properties of N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], respectively (Figure 2). According to TGA,
a weight loss of 4.5% between 200 and 350 °C revealed elimination
of four nitrogen atoms (theoretically representing 4% of the total Mw). DSC was performed in several cycles below
160 °C and near 250 °C to determine the melting and crystallization
temperatures and identify the formation of nitrene, respectively.
Below 160 °C, the molecule exhibited a melting transition at
108 °C and a cold crystallization within three transitions between
40 and 73 °C (second cycle). This behavior was fully reversible
and highly stable up to 160 °C. Upon heating to 250 °C (third
cycle), an exothermic signal revealed the decomposition of the azide
group at 180 °C, in agreement with TGA, and the formation of
highly reactive nitrene by its triplet sensitization,37 which could react with the neighboring molecules, leading
to the formation of cross-links and disrupting the organization. The
corresponding DSC cycle was irreversible, as no transition was observed
for the fourth cycle. We also carried out DSC experiments on N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] mixed with P3HT or
PC61BM, to specify the activation temperature needed for
the cross-linking reaction and prove its selectivity. The DSC curves
of the additive before and after adding P3HT remained similar, which
confirmed the selectivity of the reaction between the molecule and
PC61BM, where an exothermic peak at about 120 °C was
visualized (Figure 2c). We noticed that the thermal stability of molecule 6 (160 < T > 180 °C) was higher than the
temperature needed (110–140 °C)38 to covalently link N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] to PC61BM at the two six-membered rings via 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition,39 forming a stable BHJ AL
morphology.

Energy-level matching between AL materials is also
a requirement
for optimum device functionality. The highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels
of P3HT, N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], and
PC61BM were estimated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) from
the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials of the redox curves
(Figure 3). Assuming
that the energy levels were not affected when the materials were in
the blend, the electrochemical band gap of N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] was calculated to be 1.6 eV. This molecule
behaves as an acceptor, on the basis of the positions of its HOMO
and LUMO levels with respect to those of P3HT. The exciton generated
in P3HT could be transferred to N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], and the excitons generated by N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] could be dissociated into charge carriers at
the interface with PC61BM. The electrons transport to the
cathode through channels formed by PC61BM, and the holes
at N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] could transport
to the anode directly or through channels of P3HT. This is a favorable
structure, which should allow efficient charge separation and transport.40

used as an external reference (EFc+/Fc = 0.45 V/saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). Potentials
are given vs those of SCE.

Inverted organic solar cells with binary and ternary blends
were
fabricated as described in the Experimental Section. All devices with N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min to complete the cross-linking
reaction with PC61BM. The average PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc are presented
in Figure 4. The PCE
of all of the devices was constant, independent of the N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] ratio. Indeed, the fill factor
(FF) was slightly decreased in comparison to that of the binary blend
but was independent of the ternary blend ratio. On the contrary, Voc increased progressively with an increase
in the N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] concentration.
This was an argument toward either a parallelly linked tandem cell
mechanism, with independent donor networks, or the so-called alloy
mechanism,42 where two different molecules
were closely intermixed and acted as an alloy with new energy levels.
In our case, the cross-linked N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] and PC61BM could act in this manner with
a higher LUMO, leading to an actual increase in Voc. Unexpectedly, Jsc showed
a very small decrease with increased ratios of N3-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. The Jsc values
were confirmed by EQE measurements, presented in Table 1; the difference stayed in the
acceptable margin of 3%. Overall, the decrease in Jsc was compensated by the increase in Voc, which finally gave a nearly constant PCE.

PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF for devices with ternary blends of different
ratios (P3HT:N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2]:PC61BM), after the cross-linking reaction; values are extracted

To investigate the Jsc drop, the absorption
spectra of thin film N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] and the binary and ternary blends were measured. They are presented
in Figure 5a. With
three absorption bands centered at 405, 650, and 705 nm, the absorption
of the additives matched perfectly the gap in the absorption of P3HT:PC61BM. The ternary blend is expected to have a broader absorption,
so more charge carriers could be generated. Indeed, the absorption
band corresponding to the third component appeared from ratios as
low as 1:0.05:1 and further increased with the amount of additive.
However one could note that N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], being a small molecule, had a very small absorption in
comparison to that of the semicrystalline polymer. A higher ratio
of at least 1:0.20:1 was then necessary to exhibit a significant input
from the additive. Besides, the drop before the PC61BM
band at 315 nm was reduced with the concentration of additive. This
is typical of the presence of multiadduct fullerenes41 in the AL as a marker of increased presence of cross-linked
PC61BM and an efficient cross-linking reaction between
the additive and PC61BM. The contribution of the additive
in the photocurrent was confirmed on the EQE spectra presented in Figure 5b, where Jsc increased in the area of absorption of the
bis-azide molecule (between 650 and 800 nm). However, this new contribution
was counterbalanced by a progressive decrease in the contribution
by P3HT and PC61BM (between 300 and 650 nm). The equivalent
current density was calculated for each domain and the difference
with the reference of the binary blend was added as well. The results
are summarized in Table 1. Up to a ratio of 1:0.075:1, the decrease in the P3HT:PC61BM area was fully compensated by the contribution of the dye. For
higher concentrations, the decrease was larger than the increase,
leading to a limited overall Jsc reduction.
Surprisingly, between 300 and 650 nm, the decrease in the EQE contribution
of the P3HT was at the opposite of the increase of its absorption
on the UV−vis spectrum. The limited thickness increase of 18
nm (9%) between the binary blend (ratio of 1:1, film thickness of
198 nm) and optimal ternary blend (ratio of 1:0.2:1, film thickness
of 216 nm) (Figure S13) could not explain
the Jsc decrease.43,44 It could be attributed to an increase in recombination due to a
less favorable morphology induced by the addition of the third component
or by its cross-linking with PC61BM.

Figure 5 Evolution of (a) thin
film ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption and (b) EQE for different ratios of N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], after the cross-linking step (150 °C,
10 min).

This observation was supported
by the UV–vis absorption
and EQE spectra recorded on bulk heterojunctions as a function of
the additive concentration (Figure 5). As already mentioned, in the solid state (Figure 5a, brown spectrum),
the small molecule showed two characteristic vibronics at 650 nm (black
dashed arrow) and 705 nm (gray dashed arrow), attesting its crystalline
domains. However, in the ternary blends, the 705 nm absorption band
was absent, signifying that the small molecule should be homogeneously
dispersed in the bulk or that it formed amorphous domains. In a same
manner, the crystallization of P3HT remained effective, but to a lesser
extent (Figure 5a and Table S1, ratio between optical densities at
555 and 605 nm extracted from Figure 5), with the addition of the cross-linker. Indeed, the
absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM showed the absorption band of PCBM
(340 nm) and that of P3HT (450–650 nm), with three well-known
vibronic transitions of P3HT. The first two transitions (at 525 and
555 nm) were attributed to the π–π* transition,
and the shoulder at 605 nm was due to interchain interactions. Upon
incorporation of the bis-azide molecule in the P3HT:PCBM blend, an
increase in the absorption strength of P3HT along with a slight modification
of the relative intensities of the vibronic peaks (OD605 nm/OD555 nm) was observed. The decrease in the OD605 nm/OD555 nm ratio upon addition of
an additive (0–0.05) was directly related to a decrease in
the intermolecular coupling and a lower crystallization of P3HT. For
higher concentrations of the additive (0.075–0.3), the decrease
in OD605 nm was compensated by an increase in the
absorption band of the additive itself at 650 nm. As a result, the
OD605 nm/OD555 nm ratio increased.
Even if a slight decrease in the OD605 nm/OD555 nm ratio was observed, the sharp vibronic peak located at 605 nm attested
the crystallinity of P3HT. As a consequence, most of the small molecules
were certainly ejected from the crystalline domains of P3HT to the
interface with PCBM. As a result, the reaction with PCBM was almost
complete.

To summarize, despite the fact that the Jsc did not increase with an increase in the concentration
of
N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2], PCE stayed constant
irrespective of concentration. This is not always the case in terms
of the additive for thermal stabilization, where we could see a decrease
in PCE with the an increase in additive concentration after the cross-linking
reaction, as, for example, with the DAZH.26 This effect is directly due to the contribution by the additive
in Jsc and the Voc increase.

Finally, thermal stabilization was investigated.
After deposition
of the AL, the samples were exposed to accelerated thermal ageing
at 150 °C for 24 h; then, the top electrode was deposited and
the devices were characterized. PCE retention in comparison to that
in pristine devices is presented in Figure 6a. The devices made with the binary blend
showed a poor retention of less than 20%. This was the result of phase
segregation between the donor and acceptor and the apparition of PC61BM aggregates, visible in the microscope images of the AL
presented in Figure 6b. With the increase in the amount of bis-azide CPDT(FBTTh2)2, the PCE after ageing was less and less affected, until
it reached full stabilization at a ratio of 1:0.2:1. At this concentration,
no PC61BM clusters were observed on the microscope images
anymore. This retention of 100% of the initial efficiency even after
aggressive thermal ageing at 150 °C for 24 h was better than
that of other reported additives, such as BABP (92% after 24 h at
150 °C) or DAZH (82% after 130 h at 85 °C).24,38 Furthermore at such a concentration, the equivalent number of PC61BM molecules per azide was 3.8, whereas for our previously
described cross-linker, BABP,24 at the
optimized concentration, this ratio was of 2.9. Less of the new additive
was necessary to thermally stabilize the blend.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the synthesis of a bis-azide
cross-linker with a
wide absorption (up to 800 nm) and high molar mass (1386.8 g mol–1) was demonstrated for the first time to elaborate
a stable morphology at elevated temperature. This new molecule has
a modular (D1-A–D2-A–D1) architecture and bears an azide functional group on both undecyl
alkane chains of the central CPDT unit. The high purity and good thermal
stability of the molecule were evaluated by TGA and HPLC characterization.
Effective and complete cross-linking of the azide group with PC61BM at the two six-membered rings occurred between 130 and
150 °C according to DSC and IR measurements. The
frontier orbital energy levels of the molecule measured by CV were
well suited with the P3HT-PCBM system for efficient charge separation
and transportation. This molecule combined
a double functionality for the blend: it broadened the absorption
of the AL, contributed to the global current of the cells, and acted
as a thermal stabilizer. In comparison to other existing additives,
this one showed 100% stabilization because the PCE was maintained
at its original value after curing of the azide and thermal ageing.
So far, this cross-linker is the most performing additive to retain
PCE during thermal ageing.

Materials
All reactions
involving air-sensitive reagents were carried out under a dried nitrogen
atmosphere, using dried glassware, unless otherwise stated. CPDT was
purchased from TCI. All other chemicals and solvents were purchased
from Aldrich (France) and ABCR (Germany). These chemicals were used
as received, without any further purification. Anhydrous THF was obtained
using a solvent purification system (SPS-800). 5′-Hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5-trimethylstannane
(D1), 4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
(A), and 4-bromo-5-fluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (D1-A) were prepared by
methods similar to those reported in the literature.29−31

with 100 mL of hexane. The organic layer was washed with water and
dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (Mg2SO4). After concentrating the solution, the crude product was purified
by silica gel column chromatography using a mixture of hexane and
ethyl acetate (75:25 v/v) as the eluent, followed by evaporation of
the solvent, yielding a colorless liquid (yield = 85%).

Synthesis of 4-4′-Bis(((tert-butyl)dimethylsilyloxy)undecyl)dicyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (2)
Ground potassium hydroxide (KOH, 500 mg, 9 mmol) and potassium
iodide (25 mg) were added to a suspension of 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (400 mg, 2.243
mmol) in DMSO (20 mL). The mixture was then degassed three times and
filled with nitrogen gas. After stirring for 30 min, (11-bromoundecanyloxy)(tert-butyl)dimethylsilane (1) (2 g, 5 mmol)
was added dropwise. A change in the color to green was observed after
the addition of the first drop. The reaction was quenched with water
after agitating for 24 h at room temperature (r.t.). The product was
extracted with hexane and washed with aq. NH4Cl. The crude
product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using pentane/DCM
(100:0 to 80:20) (v/v) as the eluent. The desired product was obtained
as a light yellow oil (yield = 85%).

Synthesis of 2,6-Di-(trimethyltin)-4-4′-bis(((tert-butyl)dimethylsilyloxy)undecyl)dicyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (3)
n-Butyl lithium solution (BuLi) in hexane
(2.5 M, 0.65 mL, 1.6 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution
of 4-4′-bis(((tert-butyl)dimethylsilyloxy)undecyl)dicyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (2) (300 mg, 0.4 mmol) in dry THF (4 mL) at −78 °C. After
complete addition, the liquid-nitrogen bath was removed immediately
to increase the temperature to r.t. and the mixture was further stirred
for 1 h. After cooling to −78 °C, trimethyltin chloride
(Me3SnCl, 1 M, 2 mL, 2 mmol) was added slowly. Finally,
the solution
was suddenly warmed by replacing the liquid-nitrogen bath with a water
bath and stirring for 18 h before pouring into deionized (DI) water.
Extraction was performed using diethylether and by repeated washing
with DI water. Drying over anhydrous Mg2SO4,
filtering, and solvent evaporation gave a crude product, which was
placed under high vacuum for 24 h (to remove excess trimethyltin chloride)
to yield a yellow viscous oil (yield ∼98%), which was used
in the next step without further purification.

To a 10
mL microwave vial equipped with a sealed septum were added 2,6-di-(trimethyltin)-4-4′-bis(((tert-butyl)dimethylsilyloxy)undecyl)dicyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (3) (210 mg, 0.196 mmol), 4-bromo-5-fluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (190 mg, 0.4 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (20 mg, 8.5%), and anhydrous chlorobenzene (2 mL).
The vial was heated in a microwave reactor at 100 °C (5 min),
110 °C (5 min), 120 °C (5 min), 140 °C (5 min), and
160 °C (120 min). Upon cooling, the resulting viscous blue liquid
was concentrated. The crude product was placed in a Soxhlet thimble
and washed with copious amounts of methanol and ethanol. Then, the
product was purified by silica gel column chromatography twice using
as the eluent a mixture of pentane and chloroform (100:0 to 50:50)
(v/v). The product was recovered as a metallic sticky purple solid
(yield = 65%).

Experimental Section
Device
Fabrication
All of the devices have the same
structure: glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/AL/MoO3/Ag.
ITO-coated glass was cleaned in successive solutions of soap dissolved
in deionized water, pure deionized water, and isopropanol for 15 min
under ultrasonication. After drying the substrate in air, UV–ozone
treatment (10 min) was applied to the substrate to increase the hydrophilic
nature of the surface and remove residual organic contamination. The
ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich)
in 0.15 mol L–1 absolute ethanol and adding 0.15
mol L–1 monoethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich). The solution
was stirred for 2 h at 50 °C and then spin-coated on the cleaned
ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The films were then annealed
at 180 °C over 1 h. The final ZnO thickness was 40 nm. All further
elaboration and characterization steps were carried out in an inert
atmosphere in gloveboxes. Solutions of P3HT and PC61BM
(20 mg mL–1) were prepared with a weight ratio of
1:1, heated at 85 °C for 15 min, and then kept at 50 °C
overnight. A mother solution of fresh N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] was prepared (0.5–6 mg mL–1) and added to the binary solutions directly before spin-coating.
The ternary solutions were stirred at r.t. for 30 min in a tinted
vial. The AL was spun at 1000 rpm over 40 s. To obtain an optimized
morphology, the samples were then immediately transferred into glass
Petri dishes, in which they could slowly dry.32 After solvent annealing, the substrates were annealed at 150 °C
for 10 min to complete the cross-linking reaction between N3-[CPDT(FBTTh2)2] and PC61BM. Finally,
the MoO3 (7 nm) and Ag (70 nm) top electrodes were thermally
evaporated. For each condition, two substrates containing four cells
of 10 mm2 were fabricated. In this way series data contain
up to eight values. This allows us to calculate the average and standard
deviations of PCE, the FF, the short-circuit density current (Jsc), and the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Current density versus voltage, J(V), curves were obtained for each devices using
Keithley 2400, under an AM1.5 sun-simulator with a Xenon lamp, calibrated
with a radiometer (IM1400) at 100 mW cm–2. The samples
were eventually encapsulated by gluing a glass substrate on top of
the electrode with NOA61 glue (Epotecny). EQE was estimated outside
the glovebox with a setup consisting of a Xenon lamp connected to
a Horiba monochromator coupled with a picoamperemeter. Besides the
full devices, ALs were deposited directly on quartz substrates. Absorption
spectra were recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Safas
Monaco MC2). Optical imaging was performed with a magnification 50×
(Zeiss microscope). The AL thickness was measured with a profilometer
(α step IQ).
