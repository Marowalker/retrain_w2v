In the present
study, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and static light scattering
(SLS) have been used to study the solution properties and self-interaction
of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) molecules in three pharmaceutically
relevant buffer systems. Measurements are carried out up to high protein
concentrations and as a function of ionic strength by adding sodium
chloride to probe the role of electrostatic interactions. The effective
structure factors (Seff) as a function
of the scattering vector magnitude q have been extracted
from the scattering profiles and fit to the solution of the Ornstein–Zernike
equation using a screened Yukawa potential to describe the double-layer
force. Although only a limited q range is used, accurate
fits required including an electrostatic repulsion element in the
model at low ionic strength, while only a hard sphere model with a
tunable diameter is necessary for fitting to high-ionic-strength data.
The fit values of net charge agree with available data from potentiometric
titrations. Osmotic compressibility data obtained by extrapolating
the SAXS profiles or directly from SLS measurements has been fit to
a 10-term virial expansion for hard spheres and an equation of state
for hard biaxial ellipsoids. We show that modeling rHSA as an ellipsoid,
rather than a sphere, provides a much more accurate fit for the thermodynamic
data over the entire concentration range. Osmotic virial coefficient
data, derived at low protein concentration, can be used to parameterize
the model for predicting the behavior up to concentrations as high
as 450 g/L. The findings are especially important for the biopharmaceutical
sector, which require approaches for predicting concentrated protein
solution behavior using minimal sample consumption.

Introduction
In formulation of proteinaceous
drugs, one of the main concerns
is the physical stability of the drug molecule. Proteins at high concentrations
tend to self-associate, potentially leading to high-viscosity solutions
or aggregation. Modifications such as oxidation or adsorption to the
vial are additional concerns in formulation strategies. If the three-dimensional
structure of a protein is not conserved, this could lead to degradation,
loss of activity, and the formation of new epitopes, which could induce
an immunological response. Finally, the formulation of course needs
to be compatible with the route of administration. All of these challenges
generate issues during production, for ensuring prolonged shelf-life
of a biopharmaceutical, and in administration, which all set high
demands on the formulation.1

Human serum albumin (HSA) is, with a blood concentration
of 35–50
mg/mL, the most abundant plasma protein comprising more than half
the amount of proteins in the blood plasma. HSA has many important
physiological functions and, for instance, regulates the colloidal
osmotic pressure and transports endogenous physiological metabolites
and exogenous ligands, such as fatty acids, hormones, bile acids,
and drugs.2−4 These properties have drawn much interest from the
pharmaceutical industry and particularly in clinical applications.5 HSA’s pharmacokinetic properties are utilized
in drug-delivery systems, and HSA’s ability to increase the
solution stability of other proteins is used in drug formulations.

In formulations, HSA is used as a stabilizer, preventing aggregation,
as an antiadsorption agent, or as an antioxidant6,7 and
was traditionally widely used in pharmaceutical products such as Avonex
and Epogen. However, due to severe safety issues associated with infection
of patients with human immunodeficiency virus from plasma-derived
constituents in medicine in the 1980s and the 1990s and later with
the occurrence of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease transferred from
infected cows, it became increasingly difficult to get regulatory
approval of drugs containing constituents of mammalian origin. The
use of serum-derived HSA was therefore limited. With the development
of recombinant HSA (rHSA) derived from yeast (Recombumin, Albumedix
Ltd.), the interest has resurfaced in the last decade and an increasing
number of modern pharmaceuticals containing rHSA like the trivalent
subunit vaccine M-M-RII and the tetravalent subunit vaccine
ProQuad have been marketed.

The use of albumin to stabilize
protein-based drugs at low concentration
was established decades ago and is expected to function via competitive
inhibition of the protein-based drug adsorption to other materials.8 At protein-based drug concentrations less than
0.1 mg/mL, adsorption of protein-based drugs to the available air–liquid
and solid–liquid surfaces in the primary packaging material
will result in depletion and/or lead to surface-induced degradation
of the active component. Hence, prevention of drug adsorption is thus
essential and can be mitigated by addition of a nonionic detergent
or by addition of HSA.

In contrast to this, the mechanism of
action for preventing aggregation
is speculative for formulations with protein-based drug concentrations
above 1 mg/mL. Here, rHSA is used in concentrations ranging from a
few mg/mL to all the way up to around 50 mg/mL. At these higher concentrations,
the aggregation of proteins is a complex process. One commonly recognized
mechanism is the nonspecific effects of steric exclusion, where the
protein molecules in question are excluded from the volume occupied
by other protein species. With increasing concentration, the volume
of the solution available to proteins is restricted. In terms of thermodynamics,
the entropy of a crowded solution is significantly reduced and hence
the free energy of the proteins increases. The system reacts to this
by association of proteins to reduce the exclusion of volume.9,10 However, steric exclusion is not entirely nonspecific, and in many
cases, the aggregation propensity of proteins depends on their specific
structures and local environments.11,12 It has been
shown for solutions of monoclonal antibodies at relatively high concentrations
that HSA prevents liquid–liquid phase separation, which is
often preempted by aggregation or crystallization.13 Understanding the stabilizing ability of rHSA requires
first elucidating the thermodynamic behavior in rHSA-only solutions
from low to high protein concentrations. In dilute protein solutions,
the osmotic pressure (or osmotic compressibility) of the solution
is determined by the osmotic second virial coefficient B22, which is commonly obtained by static light scattering
(SLS).14−20 The pH and ionic strength dependence of B22 provides an insight into the intermolecular forces underpinning
the solution behavior.16−18,21−25 Measurements for solutions of either rHSA or bovine serum albumin
(BSA) have been rationalized in terms of potential of mean force models
that describe the protein–protein interaction using an excluded
volume potential and the electric double-layer force from the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) theory and, in some cases, an additional short-ranged protein–protein
attraction.26−29

Early studies by Tardieu et al.30−34 on α-crystallin found in the eye lens showed
how small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) could be used for examination
of the interaction of proteins in highly concentrated solutions. The
α-crystallin interaction was modeled using the renormalized
mean spherical approximation with the electric double-layer potential
from the DLVO theory and a hard core potential (the excluded volume
effect).31

Due to its high solubility
in aqueous solutions, serum albumin
has been used as a model system to study high protein concentrations
(up to 500 mg/mL) in buffer-free solution with and without salts.35−41 SAXS experiments indicate that monovalent salts such as NaCl in
general have a screening effect. Under low-ionic-strength conditions,
measured structure factors were fit to the mean spherical approximation,
which is based on a spherical model using only the electric double-layer
potential from the DLVO theory, whereas at higher salt concentrations
(greater than 1 M), the structure factors reflected the presence of
a short-ranged attraction between proteins.41 The authors postulated the existence of a repulsive hydration force
to prevent phase separation, which would ordinarily occur in the presence
of an attractive interaction. Small-angle neutron scattering studies
of HSA interacting in D2O with and without NaCl (1.08 M)
were fit by Sjöberg and Mortensen to Monte Carlo simulations
using an ellipsoidal shape to describe the protein.42,43 The fitting required including an additional square well repulsive
potential at low salt conditions and a short-ranged repulsive Yukawa
potential at high salt concentration, but there was no evidence for
a short-ranged protein–protein attraction.

In the present
study, to shed more insight into the observed stabilizing
effect, we have used SAXS and SLS to study the solution properties
and self-interaction of rHSA molecules in three pharmaceutically relevant
buffer systems with different ionic strengths. The mean spherical
approximation has been used to fit structure factor curves measured
by SAXS and we have compared a hard sphere versus ellipsoidal model
for reproducing osmotic compressibility curves up to 315 g/L obtained
from SLS and SAXS. We show that rHSA behavior in solutions at NaCl
concentrations up to 500 mM can be adequately explained without invoking
the existence of any short-ranged attraction, where the excluded volume
effects are more accurately captured using an ellipsoidal model rather
than a spherical one. We find the only effect of changing the formulation
buffer is to alter the strength of electrostatic interactions due
to differences in the solution pH and ionic strength.

Theory
The next section provides an overview of the protein–protein
interaction model, focusing on how the model is characterized from
measurement of the osmotic second virial coefficient, and its relationship
to the structure factor at high protein concentrations. Furthermore,
we provide the relationships between the SLS and SAXS measurements
and the osmotic compressibility in terms of the measured structure
factor and emphasize the limitations of using SAXS to probe the behavior
of anisotropic shaped particles such as rHSA.

Protein–Protein
Interaction Theory
The two-body
potential of mean force, w(r), where r is the center-to-center separation between proteins, provides
the input into models for predicting thermodynamic properties and
the equilibrium solution microstructure. w(r) corresponds to an interaction free energy averaged over
the relative orientations between a pair of proteins as well as the
solvent degrees of freedom. Previous studies on BSA and HSA under
low- to moderate-ionic-strength conditions indicate that the protein–protein
interaction is well described using a hard sphere repulsion in combination
with an electrostatic contribution.41,44 A theoretical
model for the electrostatic terms is given by the electric double-layer
potential derived within the DLVO theory, which treats the protein
as a uniformly charged sphere immersed in a dielectric continuum containing
point charges (e.g., salt ions). For low surface potentials, a reasonable
approximation for the two-body interaction free energy is given by eq 1 1  where Z corresponds to the
protein valency, σ is an effective hard sphere diameter, and
β is the dimensionless inverse temperature 1/kbT, where kb is the Boltzmann constant. The excluded volume contribution to the
interaction potential is controlled by the parameter σ, which
controls the distance of closest approach between a pair of proteins.
The range of the electrostatic interactions is controlled by κ,
the inverse Debye–Hückel screening length 2  where I is the
ionic strength
of the solution, e is the electronic charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant
of water, and NA is Avogadro’s
number. λB corresponds to the Bjerrum length , which is the separation between
a pair
of ions when the Coulomb energy is equal to thermal energy.

A commonly used method for characterizing simplified models for w(r) is through measurements of the osmotic
second virial coefficient, B22v, obtained here through static
light scattering. B22v is related to w(r) through an average over r given by 3  Equation 3 can be further simplified by carrying out
the integration
over r between 0 and σ to give 4  where B22hs corresponds to the excluded
volume interaction of a hard sphere of diameter σ, which is
equal to 4 times the sphere volume (2πσ3/3).
The integral on the right-hand side of eq 4 includes the contributions of all forces
except for excluded volume, which are collectively referred to as
soft potentials.

SAXS experiments provide information about
the spatial protein
density distribution in terms of the static structure factor. For
an isotropic system, S(q) is related
to the Fourier transform of the pair distribution function g(r) by 5  where ρ is the protein molecular density
and q is the momentum transfer vector magnitude q = 4π sin θ/λ, where λ
is the wavelength of the X-rays and 2θ is the scattering angle.
The pair distribution function corresponds to the normalized density
for the centers of protein molecules in a spherical shell located
at r with thickness Δr and
volume 4πr2Δr about a protein molecule fixed at the origin. The Ornstein–Zernike
(OZ) equation, when combined with an appropriate closure relation,
can be used to determine g(r) or
equivalently S(q) in terms of the
interaction potential, w(r). In
this work, we have used an analytical solution for the OZ equation
based on the mean spherical approximation for the Yukawa interaction
model, which has the same mathematical form as the electric double-layer
potential given in eq 1.27

SLS Theory and Analysis
The measured quantity in an
SLS experiment termed the excess Rayleigh ratio R̅θ is equal to the light scattered by the protein
sample minus the scattering from the solvent mixture at the same chemical
potential as the protein solution. The relationship to the osmotic
compressibility of the solution for a single solute in a mixed solvent
is given by45−47 6  where c is the protein mass
concentration, Mw is the protein molecular
weight, and S(0) is the static structure factor evaluated
in the limit of q → 0, which is related to
the osmotic compressibility of the protein solution. K is an optical constant equal to 2π2n02/(NAλ4), where n0 is the refractive index of the solvent. The refractive
index increment (∂n/∂c) is at constant temperature and chemical potential of solvent components,
which is obtainable through dialysis equilibrium experiments. We use
a literature value approximately equal to 0.185 mL/g measured for
BSA in solutions at low to moderate tonicities.48Equation 6 is only valid when there is no angle dependence of the scattered
light, which is a good approximation when the characteristic correlation
length scale is less than 1/20th the wavelength of the incident light.

The experimental osmotic second virial coefficient, denoted here
as B22 = NAB22v/Mw2, is determined from SLS using only low-protein-concentration
data. In this case, the osmotic compressibility is expanded in a virial
expansion, which gives in the low-protein-concentration limit 7  B22 is
determined
from a linear fit to eq 7 from 10 measurements with protein concentration varying between
2 and 20 g/L. The regressed slope is equal to 2B22, and the inverse of the y-intercept is
equal to Mw. In the Results
and Discussion section, the reported error bars correspond
to the standard error in the slope estimation.

SAXS Theory
A
SAXS experiment is used to measure the
scattering intensity per unit volume, I(q), as a function of the scattering vector q. The
total scattering intensity is given by49 8  where P(q) is the form factor defined
as P(q) = ⟨|Fj(q,Ωj)|2⟩Ωj/(Δρ)2Vp2, Δρ
is the excess scattering length
density of the protein, and ϕ is the protein volume fraction.
For a particle with a homogeneous electron density distribution, the
scattering length Fj(q,Ωj) is
given by an integral over the particle volume Vp 9  where Rj corresponds to the
spatial coordinate within
the particle relative to the particle center of mass and Ωj defines the particle orientation in the coordinate system
of the laboratory reference frame.

The profile Seff(q) can be obtained either by using
an analytical expression for the form factor or by normalizing the
X-ray scattering profile with data obtained at low protein concentration,
which is the approach used here. At low protein concentration, there
are no orientational or intermolecular correlations between particles
and Seff(q) = 1 so that50 10  where the subscript low
denotes a low concentration
property. As such, the structure factor profile can be obtained by
normalizing the intensity profile by the low-concentration data according
to 11  Using eq 11 requires that there are no protein conformational
changes as a function of protein concentration. Conformational changes
would be reflected by differences in the normalized I(q)/c profiles over a range, where Seff(q) ∼ 1 corresponding
to q > 1.0 nm–1, which is not
observed
for rHSA solutions studied here.

For nonspherical particles, Seff(q) is given by an ensemble
average over all possible orientations
and separations between particles i and j 12  where N is particle number.
The main purpose of measuring Seff is
to obtain information about the solution structure as characterized
in terms of the true structure factor, which is defined in terms of
an ensemble average over center-of-mass positions between particles 13  For spherical particles, the apparent
and
true structure factors are equal to each other because there is no
orientational dependence of the scattering factor, Fj. For anisotropic particles, the measured
structure factor can be related to the true structure factor, S(q), using the decoupling approximation,
which assumes that there are no orientational correlations between
particles. The approximation is given by 14  where the
decoupling parameter is defined
as βDA = ⟨|Fj(q)|⟩Ωj2/⟨|Fj(q)|2⟩Ωj.

The limitations
of fitting SAXS data with the decoupling approximation
or using spherical models have been examined using molecular simulations
of ellipsoids with aspect ratios ranging from 0.333 to 3.51 For aspect ratios less than 0.5 or greater than
2, the simulated Seff(q) profile only equals the true structure factor for the ellipsoids
in the range q(ab2)1/3 ≲ 2, where a and b correspond to the radii along and perpendicular to the symmetry
axis, respectively. The deviations between the structure factor profiles
at larger q grow with increasing volume fraction,
leading to a shift in the major peak in Seff(q) to a higher q value than that
occurring in S(q). Because the peak
location is inversely related to the averaged particle center-to-center
separation, matching the peak position can lead to underestimating
key length scales in intermolecular correlations. In addition, for
ellipsoids with aspect ratios less than 0.5, there is an occurrence
of a second peak at higher q in Seff(q) that does not reflect any characteristic
length scale observable from S. For these particles,
the decoupling approximation does not provide any additional accuracy
due to strong orientational couplings at close center-to-center separation.
Fitting form factor models to experimentally derived SAXS data indicates
that HSA has a similar shape to an oblate ellipsoid with dimensions
equal to 17 × 42 × 42 Å3,41 which corresponds to an aspect ratio of approximately 0.4.
To avoid any artifacts of these assumptions, only the region in the Seff(q) profile corresponding
to q(ab2)1/3 ≲ 2 or equivalently q < 0.06 Å is
used in our fitting.

SAXS Analysis
All calibrations and
corrections of the
SAXS data were done using the in-house software Bli911-4.52 Buffer averaging and subsequent subtraction
prior to data analyses were done in Primus.53 The ATSAS program package version 2.454 was used for further data analysis. Evaluation of the Guinier region
was performed within Primus. The form factor for each buffer condition, P(q), was derived from merging data at
low and high protein concentrations in the same buffer conditions.
The pair distribution function, p(r), was evaluated using the interactive program GNOM.55 An overview of the samples measured by SAXS, the SAXS scattering
data, and the data treatment parameters are provided in Tables S1–S4 and Figure S1, Supporting
Information.

The effective structure factors, Seff(q), were derived by dividing the
scattering intensity by the experimentally derived form factor for
the corresponding buffer condition following the procedure defined
by eq 11.

Results
and Discussion
Protein–Protein Interactions Probed
by SLS Scattering
Indicate that the High Salt Behavior Is Only due to Excluded Volume
Forces
The SLS data were used for determination of the osmotic
second virial coefficient, B22, and the
molecular weight. All measurements of molecular weight were on the
order of 70.0 ± 3.5 kDa, indicating monodisperse samples. B22 values plotted as a function of ionic strength
are shown in Figure 1 for solutions either in octanoate_pH7.0 or in phosphate_pH6.2 along
with a line of best fit to the octanoate_pH7.0 data. The main effect
of increasing ionic strength up to 100 mM is to screen electrostatic
repulsion, which leads to the decrease in B22 values. Over this range, the ionic strength dependence of protein–protein
interactions in terms of B22 can be rationalized
in terms of an electric double-layer force.16,17,21,22 The line of
best fit shown in Figure 1 has been obtained by fitting the octanoate_pH7.0 data to eq 4 using the double-layer
potential for w as given by eq 1. The fit parameters are the limiting value
for B22 at high ionic strength given by
the hard sphere value B22hs = 10.5 × 10–5 mL mol/g2 and a net charge value Z equal
to −16.3e. The latter is in good agreement
with the experimental value equal to −14e obtained
from potentiometric titration data at pH 756 (Tanford and Buzzell,57 obtained −13e at pH
7.3) indicating that the DLVO potential provides an adequate representation
of the electrostatic contribution to the protein–protein interactions.

Figure 1 B22 values plotted vs ionic strength
for solutions in octanoate_pH7.0 (closed circles) and phosphate_pH6.2
(open circles). The solid line is the best fit of octanoate_pH7.0
data corresponding to Z = −16.3e and B22hs = 10.5 × 10–5 mL mol/g2.

In modeling the protein–protein
interactions, we neglected
any contributions from a short-ranged protein–protein attraction
so that the contribution to B22 at high
salt concentration is only from excluded volume forces. This assumption
can be checked by comparing the fit value for B22hs versus a theoretical
estimation of the parameter. The excluded volume for anisotropic-shaped
proteins can be approximated by the excluded volume for a hypothetical
sphere with the same hydrodynamic diameter as the protein.58 The literature value for the hydrodynamic diameter
of BSA is approximately 74 Å,59 which
corresponds to an excluded volume contribution in experimental units
equal to 11.1 × 10–5 mL mol/g2.
A similar value was reported independently36 through calculating the excluded volume for an ellipsoid that gives
the best fit to the form factor data for BSA. The theoretical value
is indeed very close to our results for B22 at 500 mM sodium chloride concentration equal to 10.8 ± 0.7
× 10–5 and 11.1 ± 0.5 × 10–5 mL mol/g2 for octanoate_pH7.0 and phosphate_pH6.2, respectively,
which, in turn, are similar to the fit value of B22hs because
electrostatic interactions are sufficiently screened under these conditions.
The close agreement between the theoretical estimate and the high
ionic strength data for B22 indicates
that there is a negligible contribution from the short-ranged attraction.
This deduction is consistent with SAXS studies of BSA and HSA under
low- to moderate-ionic-strength conditions, which do not require any
short-ranged protein–protein attraction in models for fitting
to structure factor profiles.35,41,44 This behavior is in direct contrast to SAXS studies of lysozyme,
which require including a short-ranged attraction in models for capturing
SAXS data even under conditions where the net protein–protein
interaction is repulsive and S(0) is less than 1.44,60

The measured values for the osmotic compressibility (or equivalent S(0)−1) obtained from SLS are compared
in Figure 2 for the
same solution conditions used to measure the B22 values. For the octanoate_pH7.0, there is a decrease in
osmotic compressibility with increasing ionic strength due to screening
the electrostatic repulsion. However, there is very little change
between the curves with 145 mM NaCl versus 500 mM NaCl as the electrostatic
forces have been sufficiently screened. The runs in phosphate_pH6.2
also follow the trends expected from considering the B22 values and the effect of electrostatic interactions,
which indicate that the protein–protein repulsion is greater
than that at pH 7, 145 mM NaCl, but less than that at 50 mM NaCl and
pH 7. The osmotic compressibility is bounded by the corresponding
curves for these solution conditions. The high salt concentration
run at pH 6.2 agrees very well with the high salt run at pH 7.0 as
the electrostatic interactions have been screened and there is very
little effect of changing the net charge on the protein due to reducing
the pH from 7.0 to 6.2. This is also expected from the B22 studies shown in Figure 1, which are similar under the high salt conditions.

Figure 2 Osmotic
compressibility measured using SLS in octanoate_pH7.0 (red
symbols) or phosphate_pH6.2 (blue symbols) at different sodium chloride
concentrations as denoted in the legend. The lines are drawn as a
guide to the eye.

Decoupling Excluded Volume
and Electrostatic Forces from Fitting
to Low-q Region of S(q)
In Figure 3a–e are shown the measured static structure factor profiles Seff(q) for rHSA as a function
of salt concentration in octanoate_pH7.0 (Figure 3b) and in phosphate_pH6.2 (Figure 3d) with a nominal protein concentration
of ∼40 g/L, and as a function of protein concentration in octanoate_pH7.0_I153
(Figure 3a), phosphate_pH6.2_I66
(Figure 3c), and citrate_pH6.5_I274
(Figure 3e). In all
cases, the extrapolated values Seff(0)
are less than 1, indicating the presence of net repulsive protein–protein
interactions. The effect of the electrostatic repulsion is apparent
from the increase in S(0) values with increasing
ionic strength as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The effect is much more
dramatic in octanoate_pH7.0 because the initial ionic strength is
18 mM, whereas in citrate_pH6.5, the lowest ionic strength curve corresponds
to 66 mM. With increasing protein concentration, the S(0) values decrease, which is expected for a system that exhibits
only repulsive interactions.

for solutions
in octanoate_pH7.0 (a) 145 mM NaCl, ∼20 to ∼150 g/L
rHSA, (b) 40 g/L rHSA, 50–500 mM NaCl; in phosphate_pH6.2 (c)
no added salt, ∼30 to ∼180 g/L rHSA, (d) 0–500
mM NaCl, 40 g/L rHSA; and (e) in citrate_pH6.5, 40–260 g/L
rHSA. The orange lines correspond to the electrostatic fitting in
phosphate_pH6.2 and octanoate_pH7.0, and to the hard sphere fitting
for the runs in citrate_pH6.5_I274.

The solid lines shown in Figure 3 are obtained from fitting data for q values less than 0.06 Å–1, which
is the region
where Seff(q) is equal
to the true structure factor S(q).51 We have included only a small q range to avoid any artifacts that arise from including
effects from orientational correlations on Seff(q), but this limits the certainty in the
estimates of fitting parameters. As such, we only consider fitting
one parameter to the data using two different approaches. First, the
fitting includes the hard sphere potential and the double-layer force,
where the protein charge is treated as a fitting parameter and the
hard sphere diameter is constrained to a value of 67 Å, which
has been shown previously to provide a good fit to SAXS data for BSA
at high protein concentration.41 The screening
length is determined from eq 2 using the experimental ionic strength. This approach is referred
to as the electrostatic model. The second approach only uses a hard
sphere potential and does not include any long-ranged repulsive interactions.
As such, the diameter is treated as a fitting parameter. The results
of the fitting are shown in Tables 12–3 along with the reduced χ2 values.

The results as a function of ionic
strength can be used to examine
the role of repulsive electrostatic interactions in the fitting. Previous
studies of BSA have shown that thermodynamic properties (e.g., osmotic
pressure, osmotic compressibility) can be accurately reproduced up
to high protein concentrations using only a hard sphere model, where
the diameter is tuned to account for any electrostatic repulsion.28,61 Similarly, phase diagrams of protein solutions can be accurately
reproduced using an effective diameter chosen to account for all repulsive
contributions to the interaction potential.62,63 As such, a key question is whether our fitting can discriminate
a model including the electric double-layer force from a model including
only hard sphere interactions. The relative accuracy of our fitting
approaches can be ascertained from the ratio of χ2 values obtained from fitting data to the hard sphere model versus
the electrostatic model, rχ = χhs2/χel2. This ratio is
plotted versus ionic strength in Figure 4 for the runs in phosphate_pH6.2 and octanoate_pH7.0.
At low-ionic-strength conditions, the electrostatic model provides
a much more accurate fit, but with increasing ionic strength above
200 mM, the accuracies become similar as the ratio approaches 1 due
to sufficient screening of the electrostatic interactions. This is
reflected by the B22 measurements at 500
mM ionic strength, which are equal to the hard sphere value within
the experimental certainty, whereas the measured B22 value in octanoate_pH7.0 with 200 mM sodium chloride
is only 10% larger in magnitude. Fitting the Seff(q) profiles taken with 500 mM NaCl to
the hard sphere model gives a diameter equal to 71 and 69 Å in
octanoate_pH7.0 and phosphate_pH6.2, respectively. Both these values
are slightly below the hard sphere diameter equal to 74 Å deduced
from the B22 measurements. We argue below
that this discrepancy in part arises due to assuming that HSA is a
sphere when fitting the structure factor at higher protein concentrations.

Figure 4 Ratio
of χ2 values obtained from fitting data
to the hard sphere model and the electrostatic model: rχ = χhs2/χel2. Solid sphere: octanoate_pH7.0; open sphere:
phosphate_pH6.2.

The fitting also provides
realistic values for the net charge of
rHSA as a function of ionic strength. The values obtained in octanoate_pH7.0
are only slightly larger than the ones obtained in phosphate_pH6.2
reflecting an expected decrease in net negative charge. The absolute
values in phosphate_pH6.2 remain relatively constant and approximately
equal to −9e, whereas in octanoate_pH7.0,
there is a slight increase from −10e to −17e when increasing ionic strength from 20 to 200 mM. The
increase has been previously observed by fitting the model to SAXS
data using the same hard sphere diameter and attributed to an increase
in chloride-ion binding.41,64 At high ionic strengths
of 500 mM, the fit value of charge is much larger, but the electrostatic
contribution to the interaction potential is very small due to the
ionic screening. This condition corresponds to the case when the fitting
cannot discriminate between the electrostatic model or a hard sphere
model with a slightly larger diameter.

The experiments in citrate_pH6.5_I274
were pushed to much higher
protein concentrations with a total ionic strength equal to 274 mM.
At this ionic strength, the effect of electrostatic interactions is
expected to be small so that the hard sphere model should provide
an adequate fitting. This indeed is the case as χ2 values are similar for both fittings for the runs at lower protein
concentration. At protein concentrations less than 100 g/L, the fitting
is similar to what was found in octanoate_pH7.0_I153, where the fit
charge is similar to −17e when using the electrostatic
model or the diameter is near to 70 Å for the hard sphere model.
With further increasing protein concentration, the fit diameter steadily
decreases to a value of 64 Å at a protein concentration of 315
g/L. At this limit, fits to the electrostatic model are not possible
when fixing the diameter to 67 Å because the osmotic compressibility
predicted by the hard sphere model is greater than the measured value
for 1/S(0). Matching the experimental data requires
either reducing the diameter below 67 Å or introducing a short-ranged
protein–protein attraction. This discrepancy likely arises
due to fitting the structure factor of an anisotropic-shaped protein
with a spherical model. The spherical assumption was examined in a
computational study for a monoclonal antibody by comparing the structure
factor profiles and osmotic compressibility of a three-bead model
for the protein to that of an equivalent hard sphere with the same
osmotic second virial coefficient.65 For
excluded volume systems, the osmotic compressibility is proportional
to the fraction of overlapping particle configurations. Because the
three-bead model and the sphere have the same osmotic second virial
coefficient, the osmotic compressibility is similar at low protein
concentrations, where only two-body interactions are significant.
With further increasing protein concentration, the osmotic compressibility
for the sphere is always greater than that for the bead model because
there are more n-particle nonoverlapping configurations
available to the anisotropic model versus the sphere of the same excluded
volume. Because the three-bead model has a similar flattened geometry
to an oblate ellipsoid, it is likely that a similar argument applies
to albumin. Indeed, in the study by Greene et al.,51 the sphere that best matches the oblate ellipsoidal structure
factor at high packing fractions (e.g. greater than 20%) is smaller
than the equivalent sphere with the same excluded volume. Our finding
that a smaller sphere is needed to model HSA at high protein concentrations
is also consistent with a molecular simulation study, indicating that
the best-fit diameter to SAXS data is 63.6 Å, which is much less
than the excluded volume diameter.35

Osmotic Compressibility Curves Measured by SAXS and SLS Are
Similar
SLS and SAXS provide complementary techniques for
estimating S(0) as both approaches rely on assumptions
about the angle dependence of the scattered light. For the SAXS data,
fitting is required to extrapolate the Seff(q) profile to the long-wavelength limit from data
obtained for q-values greater than 0.01 Å–1, whereas the SLS experiment assumes no q-dependence of scattered light for q less than approximately
0.001 Å–1. As a check of the assumptions, Figure 5 shows a comparison
of the measured values of 1/Seff(0) by
SLS to those obtained from the fits to the SAXS data in octanoate_pH7.0_I153
and in phosphate_pH6.2_I66. We find a very good agreement between
the methods for both solutions. The general rule of thumb is that
the wavelength should be greater than 20 times the characteristic
correlation length in the protein solution for neglecting the angle
dependence of scattered light. If the main contribution to protein–protein
interactions is only from excluded volume interactions, the correlation
length is expected to be on the order of the size of a protein molecule,
about 70 Å, which is much less than the wavelength of laser light
equal to 658 nm. The effects of electrostatic interactions on the
correlation length are expected to be negligible even at the lower
ionic strength conditions in phosphate_pH6.2_I66, where the screening
length is on the order of 1.2 nm.

profiles as a function of
rHSA concentration obtained from SAXS (red symbols) to those obtained
by SLS (blue symbols) for phosphate_pH6.2_I66 (triangles) or octanoate_pH7.0_I153
(circles).

Oblate Ellipsoidal Model
Is More Accurate at Describing the
Osmotic Compressibility from Low to High Protein Concentration
In Figure 6, S(0)−1 curves obtained from SLS in solutions
with 500 mM NaCl in phosphate_pH6.2 or octanoate_pH7.0 are compared
against the values obtained for citrate_pH6.5_I274 from SAXS. Because
the data agree very well with the behavior in the other buffers with
500 mM NaCl, we expect that an excluded volume model should be capable
of describing the data obtained for citrate_pH6.5_I274. As such, these
can be used to test the accuracies of using an ellipsoidal versus
spherical model. We use the virial equation including the first 10
terms in the expansion for the hard sphere equation of state, given
by 15  where Biv corresponds
to the ith virial coefficient (noting that B22v ≡ B2v). The calculated pressure from the 10-term
virial expansion agrees with simulated data for hard spheres with
a precision of ΔZ < 0.003 compared to molecular
simulations up to a packing fraction η ≡ πρσ3/6 < 0.35.

Figure 6 Measured values for S(0)−1 as
a function of rHSA concentration obtained from SLS for samples at
high salt conditions in phosphate_pH6.2 (blue squares) and octanoate_pH7.0
(red circles) and from SAXS for samples in citrate_pH6.5_I274 (black
triangles).

The ellipsoidal model
is based on the equation of state derived
by Vega.66 For oblate ellipsoids with relative
dimensions given by 1 × 2.5 × 2.5, the analytical calculations
agree with simulation data up to packing fractions equal to 0.45.67 The Vega equation of state is 16  where the nth dimensionless
virial coefficient is given by Bn* = Bnv/Vn–1, V is the volume of the ellipsoid, and the packing fraction
is given by η = ρV. The dimensionless
virial coefficients are functions of the mean radius of curvature
for the ellipsoid R and the ellipsoid surface area S and volume V. The mathematical expressions
to calculate the geometric properties, R, S, and V, and the virial coefficients are
given in ref (67).

In Figure 7, the
best fits of the spherical and the ellipsoidal model to the experimental
data in citrate_pH6.5_I274 are shown. For the spherical model, the
only fitting parameter is the hard sphere diameter σ equal to
64.7 Å. In the ellipsoidal model, we rely on the geometric structure
determined from fitting to the form factor of albumin, which is an
oblate ellipsoid with dimensions of 17 × 42 × 42 Å3.41 In the fitting, each of the
dimensions are multiplied by a constant factor f,
which is necessary to account for the effect of surface roughness
on the excluded volume calculation. The form factor should correspond
to the actual volume of albumin including a hydration layer. However,
the excluded volume is also increased due to the surface roughness
over a smooth shape with the same actual volume.68 As it is not possible to exactly quantify this effect, f is treated as a fitting parameter. The best fit to the
ellipsoidal model is shown by the solid curve in Figure 7. The ellipsoidal model appears
to provide a better representation of the data as the best-fit line
corresponding to the 10-term virial equation has too much curvature,
and as a consequence, underestimates the osmotic compressibility at
moderate protein concentrations.

Figure 7 S(0)−1 values from SAXS experiments
in citrate_pH6.5_I274 corresponding to the filled circles have been
fitted to the 10-term virial expansion (dashed red line) and the ellipsoid
model (dashed blue line). Predictions based on using parameters derived
from matching B22 = 10.5 × 10–5 mL mol/g2 are shown for the 10-term virial
expansion (solid red line) and the ellipsoid model (solid blue line).
Fit parameters are shown in the legend.

The improved accuracy of the ellipsoidal model becomes more
evident
when also considering the dilute solution behavior. The second virial
coefficient calculated for the best-fit spherical model is equal to
7.8 × 10–5 mL mol/g2, whereas the
corresponding value for the ellipsoidal model is equal to 9.6 ×
10–5 mL mol/g2. The latter is much closer
to the excluded volume contribution to B22 estimated from the SLS experiments equal to 10.5 × 10–5 mL mol/g2. Figure 7 also contains the curves for either model when the fitting
parameters are chosen to match the excluded volume contribution to B22. The ellipsoidal model prediction, as expected,
is much more accurate; the close agreement to the experimental data
indicates that the thermodynamic properties for albumin in concentrated
solutions can be predicted using the oblate model when parameterized
against a dilute solution parameter, B22.

Previous studies have shown that the hard sphere model provides
accurate fits to osmotic pressure data up to BSA concentrations of
450–500 g/L in solutions containing 150 mM NaCl for a range
of pH values between 4.5 and 7.4.61,69 Of most relevance
to the work here is the pH 7.4 data, which were reproduced using a
diameter of 69 Å by fitting the data to a six-term virial equation.
These data are reproduced in Figure 8 including the best fits using the ellipsoidal model
and the virial equation including 6 or 10 terms. A similar pattern
to the structure factor data is observed, where the spherical model
has more curvature than the ellipsoidal model, which leads to an underprediction
for the compressibility at intermediate protein concentrations. This
effect is more pronounced by increasing the precision of the virial
expansion from using 6 versus 10 terms. The calculated virial coefficients
for the best fits are 12.1 and 8.2 × 10–5 mL
mol/g2 for the ellipsoidal and spherical models, respectively.
While we have not measured the B22 value
at the pH 7.4 solution condition, which only included NaCl at a concentration
of 150 mM with no buffer ions, the value should be similar to our
experiment in octanotate_pH7.0_I154. According to the potentiometric
titration curve measured by Tanford et al.,70 there is an increase of net negative charge of ∼4e for this pH change (7.0–7.4). The corresponding
value of B22, as calculated by using the
DLVO potential, is of the order 13.0 × 10–5 mL mol/g2, which provides a close agreement to the ellipsoidal
model fit.

Conclusions
The key finding from our work is that the
thermodynamic properties
of HSA (as well as BSA) are more accurately reproduced with an ellipsoidal
versus spherical equation of state, which initially became evident
from the decrease in hard sphere diameter values obtained from fitting
the Seff(q) profiles
in citrate_pH6.5_I274. The spherical model, when parameterized on
the dilute solution measurement, overpredicts the osmotic compressibility
for excluded volume systems, an effect that grows with increasing
protein concentration when higher-order virial terms contribute more
to the thermodynamic properties. The ellipsoidal model, on the other
hand, provides a more accurate extrapolation of the dilute solution
data. This study has only been possible because there are no observable
effects of short-ranged attractions on HSA so that the behavior at
moderate ionic strengths reflects only excluded volume interactions.
Nevertheless, the work is still significant for systems that exhibit
short-ranged attraction. For instance, if an osmotic compressibility
curve, or an effective structure factor profile, is fitted to a spherical
interaction model, the fitted value of the short-ranged attraction
will likely be larger than the true value to compensate for overpredicting
the excluded volume contribution.

A key motivation for this
work was to establish if there are any
effects of typically used formulation conditions on the stability
of HSA, in particular, slight changes in pH and the effect of adding
trehalose. When comparing the runs in phosphate_pH6.2 and in octanoate_pH7.0,
the differences can be rationalized in terms of changed electrostatic
interactions due to changing the net charge of the protein. The fit
values for the net charge are 10e in phosphate_pH6.2
versus 15e in octanoate_pH7.0 over the ionic strength
range of 50–200 mM consistent with the expected change in the
protonation state of the protein as measured by Tanford et al.70 In both cases, there is a large increase at
500 mM NaCl, which, although not evident from the B22 measurements, might reflect a slight increase in protein–protein
repulsion. As such, it does not appear that the excipients, trehalose
and polysorbate, used in the buffer impact the protein–protein
interactions for HSA. This is partly because the rHSA we use is saturated
with octanoate and polysorbate-defatted rHSA will behave differently.71 Indeed, osmotic second virial coefficient studies
for lysozyme solutions in sodium chloride indicate that trehalose
weakens short-ranged protein–protein attractive forces.72 However, our study indicates that these forces
are absent, which might be why rHSA, saturated with octanoate and
polysorbate, behavior is insensitive to the nonionic components of
the formulation buffer.

It is clear that HSA is repulsive due
to its large net charge.
We speculate that this could be the physical reason for the stabilizing
effect of HSA on other proteins. HSA is screening itself and thereby
creating a network, making it possible for other proteins to distribute
themselves among the HSA molecules, preventing aggregation.

Methods
Yeast-derived rHSA in the form of 100 mg/mL Recombumin supplied
by Albumedix Ltd. was used.

Solvent Systems
Three distinct pharmaceutically
relevant
solvent systems were used (for an overview, see Table 4). The ionic strength of the buffer is determined
from summing over all of the ionic components according to ionic strength
= ∑icizi2, where ci and zi are the molar concentration and valency of ion i, respectively. Citrate_pH6.5_I274 is mimicking to the buffer of
rituximab in MabThera. This buffer has a high ionic strength. Octanoate_pH7.0_I153
is mimicking the Recombumin buffer, and phosphate_pH6.2_I66 is similar
to the buffer of bevacizumab in Avastin where the ionic strength is
quite low compared to the other two buffers. Concentration series
were measured in all three buffers, and additionally, the effect of
varying ionic strength was studied in octanoate_pH7.0 and phosphate_pH6.2,
where the ionic strength was adjusted by varying the concentration
of NaCl.

Preparation
of Protein Samples and Buffers
Buffers
were exchanged by dialysis in three shifts over 3 days at 4 °C
applying gentle stirring. The dialysis was performed with Slide-A-Lyzer
Dialysis G2 Cassettes from Thermo Scientific with the appropriate
molecular mass cutoff value. The individual samples were prepared
by diluting or concentrating the dialyzed sample. Samples with varying
salt concentrations were prepared from buffer stock solutions with
a high NaCl content by adding an appropriate amount of buffer to the
individual samples. Importantly, buffers for buffer subtraction were
also prepared to match the difference in NaCl content. Further concentration
after dialysis was done using Pall Nanosep centrifugal device with
Omega membrane 10 K cutoff. Concentration determinations were performed
with the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer from Thermo Scientific at
280 nm. The extinction coefficient was calculated to be 34 445
cm–1 M–1, with the ProtParam73 tool from ExPASy.org74 using the primary sequences of HSA.

SAXS Data Collection
SAXS data collection was performed
at the MAX II synchrotron, MAX IV laboratories at beamline I911-SAXS,
Sweden.52 The sample detector distance
and the direct beam position were calibrated using silver behenate.
Measurements on pure water were used to get the data on an absolute
scale. Buffers were measured both before and after each sample and
averaged before subtraction. The sample size was approximately 50
μL injected manually in a flow cell.

Measurements were
performed on a series of rHSA samples at various concentrations prepared
as described above. The protein concentrations measured in the individual
buffers are listed in Tables S1 and S2 with
respect to, respectively, rHSA and NaCl concentrations at fixed albumin
concentration. Data collection parameters are listed in Table S3.

SLS Data Collection
A Wyatt miniDAWN TREOS 3 angle
detector was used for the SLS experiments. Samples were injected using
a syringe pump through an in-line 0.1 mm filter, followed by the SLS
flow cell connected in series to a UV Waters 2487 absorbance detector.
We used a variable path length UV flow cell for accurate determination
of protein concentration. The path length was set to 0.05 cm such
that the absorbance of all protein solutions falls within the range
where the Beer–Lambert law is valid. SLS measurements at high
protein concentration were carried out using a Wyatt NanoStar cuvette-based
system with a low-volume quartz cuvette. Both instruments use a 60
mW GaAs diode laser with vertically polarized light at a wavelength
of 658 nm.
