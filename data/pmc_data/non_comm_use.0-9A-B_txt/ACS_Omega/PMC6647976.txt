In chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
growth of graphene, intrinsic
carbon in copper has been shown to play a role, especially during
the nucleation phase. Here, we report experimental results on depletion
of carbon from the bulk of a Cu foil to its surface at different hydrogen
pressures, which explain new aspects of the interplay between hydrogen
and intrinsic carbon prior to growth. We observed that rising H2 pressure boosts carbon depletion to the surface, but at the
same time, at elevated H2 pressures, the graphitic film
formed on the Cu surface is etched away at a faster rate. This effect
led us to practice annealing of copper under high hydrogen pressure
as an approach to decrease the total content of carbon in the copper
foil and consequently reducing the nucleation density of graphene
flakes. These results enhance our understanding about the role of
H2 in the CVD process and explain some of the inconsistencies
among the earlier reports.

1 Introduction
Since the first report
of the synthesis of a graphene film on a
copper foil using chemical vapor deposition (CVD),1 significant progress in different aspects of this technique
has been achieved2−6 and it has become the most promising method for producing graphene
for various applications.7−9 The demand for an economical and
reproducible recipe for graphene production has progressively expanded
the research for understanding the mechanisms during the growth of
graphene in theCVD process.2,10−23 It has been considered that the very low solubility of carbon in
copper makes the graphene growth process primarily governed by surface-adsorption
and inherently self-limited.10 A weak surface
diffusion barrier for carbon ad-atoms leading to high mobility of
carbon on copper at high temperatures is another reason for the growth
of graphene to be considered as a pure surface-based process.14,24,25 Briefly, CVD growth of graphene
is described to be initiated with the adsorption of carbon precursor
molecules on copper surface, followed by their dissociation to form
active carbon species which diffuse on the surface until trapped and
accumulated at defect sites. Increase in the carbon concentration
at defect sites leads to supersaturation of carbon and finally the
nucleation of graphene flakes (GFs).23,26

During
the CVD synthesis of graphene, where just a few atoms can
have a substantial effect on the growth of one-atom-thick carbon crystals,
slight variations in conditions may substantially alter the delicate
surface processes at high temperatures and can easily lead to irreproducibility.
This instigates significant difficulties against uncovering the underlying
mechanisms of the growth of graphene on copper. For example, passivation
of nucleation sites due to reaction with oxygen was initially suggested
as the reason for the suppression of graphene nucleation in the presence
of diluted oxygen.2 However, later it has
been agreed that the reduction in the nucleation is mainly due to
the etching of carbon from the surface of the Cu foil by oxygen.4,19,27−29 Likewise, whereas
most of the studies on nucleation and growth of GFs were focused on
the role of an external carbon source, either in
the form of precursor or contamination,10,11,14,23,30−33 only very recently has the role of carbon inside the foil in the nucleation of GFs been revealed.19,28,34

As Cu foil has been widely considered
to behave as pure copper
with very low solubility for carbon, the intrinsic carbon incorporated
in the Cu foil during its production has been overlooked for many
years. However, a few recent reports imply that the presence, dissolution,
and diffusion of carbon inside the copper foil makes the nucleation
and growth of graphene to be more complex and a multifunctional process
than what was proposed earlier.19,21,34,35 Therefore, to achieve a comprehensive
model for the nucleation of GFs on the Cu foil, it is essential to
understand the interplay between “presence, dissolution, and
diffusion of carbon inside the copper foil” and other parameters
such as concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen.

Depending on
its concentration, oxygen has different effects on
carbon in the Cu foil either as an etchant or as a scavenger of carbon
from the foil4,19,28 or as an impurity, which raises the solubility/diffusivity of carbon
inside the Cu foil.21,27,28 Although the etching effect of hydrogen has initially been reported,36−40 later it has been argued that oxygen/water from hydrolyzers caused
the etching of carbon on the surface of Cu, which
led to discrepancies among the reports about the nucleation process.4,41,42 However, the effect of hydrogen
on the carbon inside the bulk of the Cu foil has
not yet been fully described for the CVD process.

In a previous
work, we demonstrated spontaneous nucleation of graphene
on copper during the annealing stage under hydrogen in the absence
of any external carbon precursor. Our results not only confirmed that
the initially nucleated GFs on the Cu foil could be directly fed by
out-diffusing intrinsic carbon from inside the foil as a spontaneous
effect, but also disclosed the key role of hydrogen on depletion of
carbon from the bulk of the Cu foil to its surface as hydrogen-assisted
carbon depletion (HACD).34 We have also
observed that the H2 partial pressure during the annealing
of the Cu foil has a major effect on the structure of the carbon film;
at H2 pressures as low as 1.4 mbar, spontaneous nucleation
of graphene is favored, but when the pressure was increased to 6 mbar
predominantly disordered graphitic film (DGF) formation has occurred
on the surface.34

However, the effect
of extending H2 to a higher level
in our recent experiments ends up with etching of carbon from the
copper surface, and suppressing or even terminating the spontaneous
nucleation of graphene on copper. These results elucidate further
details about the role of hydrogen in the CVD process for growth of
graphene on Cu foil and can explain part of the inconsistencies among
some earlier reports.4,34,36−39,41,42 Supported by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
depth-profile measurements of carbon in Cu foil together with optical
microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations
of the annealed surfaces, we revealed two simultaneously acting processes
under a high concentration of hydrogen, accumulation and etching of
a carbon film on the Cu surface.

2 Results
and Discussion
In the experiments reported here, we observed
that depending on
the H2 concentration, the annealing process can result
in formation of either DGF or graphene with varying coverages and
qualities, or a completely carbon-free surface. In all cases, migration
of carbon from the bulk to the surface was evident from the ToF-SIMS
depth-profile measurements of carbon in annealed Cu foil samples which
is consistent with the HACD mechanism. We also discovered that, another
mechanism removes carbon from the Cu surface very efficiently in the
presence of high H2 concentrations; both growth and etching
of DGF takes place simultaneously and an intricate balance between
these processes results in either spontaneously nucleated GFs (SNGFs),
DGFs, or bare Cu surfaces for low, medium, or high concentrations
of H2, respectively.

Finally, we practiced annealing
of copper under maximized hydrogen
pressure for the purpose of reducing the carbon content in its bulk
and consequently achieved a reduction in the density of SNGFs. To
obtain compatible data with our earlier report,34 we used the same setup, materials, and procedures in the
experimental methods presented here. The details are given in the Experimental Methods section.

2.1 Etching
of Carbon under a High Concentration
of Hydrogen
To investigate the effect of H2 partial
pressure on intrinsic carbon during annealing, Cu foil samples (99.8%
metallic pure) were annealed under H2/Ar atmosphere with
varying pressures and concentrations of H2. The details
of the annealing parameters are given in Table 1. In Figure 1, SEM images of these samples after annealing are demonstrated
for comparison. P-x denotes a sample annealed under
H2 partial pressure of x mbar. One naively
expects to observe an increasing accumulation of DGF as the sample
index runs from P-6 to P-17 and then to P-60, simply because of boosting
of HACD. However, as it can be seen in the SEM images in Figure 1, whereas the P-6
surface was fully covered by DGF, in P-17 the DGF was partially etched,
and in P-60 DGF had completely vanished and a clean surface was obtained.
Surface coverages on P-17 and P-60 were also tested by ambient oxidation
(2 min heating at 180 °C) and confirmed the etching of the DGF
(Figure 2).

of samples annealed under different H2 pressures.
Refer to Table 1 for
process parameters for each sample. (a) P-6, a graphitic layer covered
the whole Cu surface. (b) P-17, DGF partially covering the Cu surface
as it got etched at a high hydrogen concentration. The darker regions
are the unetched parts of the graphitic layer. (c) P-60, no graphitic
layer is present as it was completely etched away during the annealing.

all after 2 min of heat treatment at 180 °C in air as it is fully
covered by a thin layer of a graphitic film. (b) The partially etched
graphitic layer on the surface of P-17 protects the copper surface
from oxidization on the coated regions. (c) The whole of the P-60
surface is oxidized as there was no graphitic film on its surface
as a barrier against ambient air during heating at 180 °C. The
variation of the oxide color is due to different oxidation rates of
copper grains with varying crystal orientations.

a After annealing under 6 mbar H2 partial pressure without
using any external carbon precursor,
DGF is formed on the surface of Cu foils. DGF coverage is determined
by scanning electron microscopy and also verified by ambient oxidation.
However, increasing the H2 pressure resulted in partial
or full etching of the graphitic layer on the copper surface.

To get a better insight into this
paradoxical effect of HACD, the
depth profile of carbon in samples P-6, P-17, and P-60 which were
treated for the same duration under varying H2 pressures
together with an untreated sample were measured by ToF-SIMS technique.
ToF-SIMS results presented in Figure 3 establish that rising of the hydrogen pressure enhances
the depletion of the carbon content from the bulk of the Cu foil as
expected in the HACD mechanism (100–400 nm depth). Additionally,
as can be seen in Figure 3, the carbon intensity profile of P-6 crosses the profile
of the untreated sample at around 10 nm depth. This is because in
P-6 the depleted carbon from below 10 nm depth is accumulated close
to its surface (above 10 nm). However, contrary to the results of
annealing at 6 mbar H2, or below,34 the concentration of carbon near the surface is decreased after
annealing at 17 mbar or above H2 pressure. Accordingly,
the crossing of carbon profiles does not happen for either P-17 or
P-60. From the SEM and optical microscopy images (Figures 1 and 2) and the dipping of carbon concentration near the surface in P-17
and P-60 (Figure 3),
we conclude that the depleted carbon from the bulk of P-17 and P-60
does not accumulate on the surface but is etched away. As further
details are discussed in the following paragraphs, we argue that increasing
the H2 pressure, hence boosting HACD, induces more defects
and deteriorates the atomic bonds of the growing graphitic film on
copper. Accordingly, the carbon-based structure cannot withstand the
annealing temperature on the surface.

Figure 3 Depth profile of C2 intensity measured
by ToF-SIMS in copper foils
treated in different levels of hydrogen pressure (untreated, P-6,
P-17, and P-60). The comparison of untreated Cu and the samples annealed
in 6 mbar (P-6), 17 mbar (P-17), and 60 mbar (P-60) clearly demonstrates
enhancement of carbon depletion below the surface of the Cu foil with
increase of the hydrogen pressure. Data of untreated and P-60 is re-plotted
from ref (34).

In general, etch and growth rates
depend on several parameters
including the purity of feeding gases.4,39,41−44 Depending on the relative rate of these counteracting
mechanisms, either the growth or the etching of the graphitic film
on the copper surface dominates at different stages of the thermal
treatment.45

Here, we discuss three
possible mechanisms that can cause or enhance
the etching of the graphitic layer when hydrogen is introduced during
annealing:(i) Etching by oxidative impurities in
hydrogen gas: role of oxygen and/or oxidative impurities in H2 gas (even at the ppm level concentrations) on etching of
graphene were demonstrated in the literature.4,41,42 The pressure of H2 also determines
the partial pressures of its oxidative impurities and therefore the
etch rate should depend on the pressure, as well. We used 99.999%
pure gases with a constant flow rate in each of our experiments. However,
as the carbon content in the copper foil is finite, the rate of out-diffusion
of carbon declines in time during the annealing and at a certain point
etch rate exceeds the growth rate.

(ii) Enhanced etch rate of DGF because
of inherent defects: here, we can consider two extreme conditions.
On one side, applying very low hydrogen pressure reduces the density
of SNGFs due to reduction of the HACD mechanism and hence the reduced
number of supersaturated spots on the surface. In this scenario, because
of the minimized density of SNGFs, larger size GFs with lesser edge
atoms and lesser defects per area will grow on the surface. On the
other side, applying high hydrogen pressure causes a fast carbon depletion
and generates supersaturation at numerous points on the surface of
the copper foil. However, the high density of supersaturated sites
on the surface will result in a DGF with very small size graphitic
domains and with more defects and edges.46 A more defected graphitic film is more prone to chemical etching
described in (i). Therefore, whereas the rate of out-diffusing carbon
declines during annealing, the etch rate exceeds the growth rate and
dominates during the early stages. As a result, more defected DGF
is etched faster; this is consistent with the observations of partially
etched P-17 and fully etched P-60.

(iii) Etching assisted/cause by hydrogen:
although it has been discussed that unintentional oxidative impurities
cause the etching effect on graphene in hydrogen atmosphere,4,41,42 as in HACD different mechanisms
for spontaneous nucleation of graphene or growing DGF are taking place,
the possibility of etching by hydrogen needs to be taken into account.
Higher H2 concentration enhances the chance of reaction
of C radicals with H+ ions over the surface of copper and
formation of C–H bonds instead of the C–C bonds. Addition
of these defect sites in DGF increases the etch rate of the film by
oxidative gas impurities. Therefore, an increased concentration of
H2 applied during the processing of P-17, compared to P-6,
may have induced more defects and speeded up the etching mechanisms
described in (i) and (ii). Under even higher hydrogen concentration,
H+ ions can totally passivate the carbon radicals that
arrive at the surface and form volatile CxHy molecules which eventually evaporate
at 1000 °C. Therefore, a graphitic film could not grow on P-60.



2.2 HACD as a Pretreatment
To Suppress Graphene
Nucleation
Different aspects and varying effects of HACD
on the Cu foil under different H2 concentrations is summarized
in the schematic diagram demonstrated in Figure 4. As the H2 partial pressure is
increased, the migration of carbon to the surface is enhanced because
of HACD. At sufficiently high pressure, the rate of removal of carbon
from the surface surpasses its rate of accumulation on the surface,
resulting in a nearly carbon-free bulk and surface. In this section,
we utilized HACD to effectively deplete the intrinsic carbon in a
Cu foil as a pretreatment to suppress spontaneous nucleation of graphene.
Sample P-1.4, which is used as reference, was annealed under 1.4 mbar
H2 and dense SNGFs were observed on its surface. Sample
P-1.4D had undergone the pretreatment of annealing under 60 mbar of
H2 followed by a second annealing phase, which is the same
as applied on sample P-1.4 (in favor of spontaneous nucleation of
graphene from the remaining carbon rather than etching them from the
surface). Process details for these experiments are given in Table 2 and the SEM images
of samples P-1.4 and P-1.4D are illustrated and compared in Figure 5. Carbon depletion
in the first phase of annealing of P-1.4D resulted in 95% reduction
in the density of SNGFs compared to P-1.4. These results demonstrate
the correlation of density of the nucleation sites with the density
of intrinsic carbon in the Cu foil. H2 pretreatment was
reported in earlier reports; nevertheless, hydrogen “surface”
cleaning was proposed as the mechanism for the observed reduction
in the nucleation density.47,48

Figure 4 Schematic illustration
of the HACD effect in different conditions.
The annealing of copper in 1.4 mbar H2 slowly depletes
the carbon atoms from its bulk; therefore, some spots on the copper
surface could pass the supersaturation threshold that leads to nucleation
and growth of GFs (P-1.4). Raising H2 pressure to 6 mbar
during annealing increases the rate of C depletion and supersaturates
the whole surface immediately. As a result, a graphitic film without
a long-range atomic order (DGF) grows on P-6.34 Further increase in H2 pressure causes more disorder
on the graphitic structure because of a faster HACD mechanism. This
results in a fragile graphitic film which is partially (P-17) or fully
(P-60) etched depending on the H2 pressure. As SNGFs are
attributed to the carbon content inside the copper, the treated Cu
foil contains lesser carbon in its bulk than the untreated one. Therefore,
when P-60 is treated again in the same way as P-1.4, SNGFs are observed
at a reduced density in P-1.4D.

Figure 5 SEM image of P-1.4 (left) and P-1.4D (right). In P-1.4D which was
treated in two annealing steps, the effective carbon depletion because
of the high concentration of hydrogen during the first step of annealing
decreases the density of SNGFs in the second step of annealing.

a Sample P-1.4D was
initially treated
before applying on it the same annealing process as P-1.4. The initial
treatment for P-1.4D was the depletion of the carbon in the bulk by
the application of the same procedure as P-60. Nucleation density
is dramatically reduced in this sample.

We measured and compared the carbon depth profiles
of P-1.4 and
P-1.4D by ToF-SIMS to verify the connection between reduction in the
density of SNGFs and density of intrinsic carbon. The carbon depth
profiles of an untreated sample and P-1.4, and P-60 and P-1.4D are
given in Figure 6.
We observe a similar trend in changing of the carbon profile from
untreated to P-1.4 and from P-60 to P-1.4D but with an overall reduced
intensity in the latter. In both cases residual carbon migrates and
accumulates toward the copper surface when annealed under 1.4 mbar
H2 pressure. Overall, the carbon profile in P-60 was reduced
by about 1 order of magnitude compared to the untreated sample, which
means that there is an order of magnitude lesser carbon near the surface
of P-1.4D after its pretreatment at 60 mbar H2 compared
to P-1.4 (inset of Figure 6). This explains why the nucleation density of GFs in P-1.4D
is about 1 order of magnitude lesser than that of P-1.4, as given
in Table 2 and displayed
in Figure 5.

Figure 6 Depth profile
of C2 intensity for untreated, medium-treated (P-1.4),
and maximum-treated (P-60 and P-1.4D) copper foils under H2. As P-1.4D is pretreated in the same annealing condition as P-60,
a similar change from untreated to P-1.4 is observed for change in
profile of P-60 to P-1.4D. Crossing the carbon profile of untreated
and P-1.4 (at 55 nm), and of P-60 and P-1.4D (at 40 nm) pointed by
green arrows, implies migration and accumulation of carbon toward
the copper surface by annealing at 1.4 mbar H2 pressure.
An order of magnitude lesser carbon concentration at the surface of
P-1.4D than of P-1.4 (inset figure) explains the 1 order of magnitude
lesser nucleation density in the former. Data of untreated and P-1.4
are re-plotted from ref (34).

Here, we need to mention
that the P-1.4D profile has a different
curve shape, exhibiting a shoulder near the surface. This is due to
the increased size of GFs on P-1.4D. Larger GFs block the normal to
the surface diffusion pathways for both hydrogen from outside into
the copper bulk and for carbon from inside of copper to its surface.
Therefore, as the HACD process slows down in the proximity of GFs,
the slope of the carbon profile declines near the P-1.4D surface.

Additionally, as can be seen in Figure 5, coverage and average flake size on P-1.4D
is more than on P-1.4 even though P-1.4D has lesser carbon than P-1.4
(35% coverage and 1 μm2 flake size for P-1.4, and
50% coverage and 20 μm2 flake size for P-1.4D). The
increased size and coverage in P-1.4D is because graphene growth is
not a linear mechanism and has a faster rate when there is a larger
distance between neighboring flakes.22

3 Conclusions
Here, we reveal novel results
about the effect of H2 pressure on the dynamics of intrinsic
carbon in a Cu foil during
annealing. On the basis of our earlier report, because of accumulation
of carbon from the bulk onto the Cu surface via HACD, a spontaneous
nucleation of graphene or growth of GFs/graphitic film is expected.
However, we find that at high pressures of H2 the Cu surface
becomes free from the carbon film. These results are interpreted in
terms of two effects on-going simultaneously, accumulation of carbon
and its etching from the surface.

Increasing the hydrogen pressure
boosts the HACD mechanism, which
leads to supersaturation of the whole copper surface, resulting in
a defected DGF. Further increase in H2 pressure causes
rapid formation of a DGF which is fragile against etching and is completely
removed from the surface by the end of the annealing phase. We discussed
that the higher H2 pressure causes more defects in the
graphitic structure grown on the Cu foil. As a result, the presence
of oxidative impurities in the flowing gas can be more effective on
etching of the more defected DGF.

Furthermore, we used the boosted
HACD at maximized H2 pressure of the system as a pretreatment
approach to effectively
reduce the carbon content of the Cu foil and minimize SNGFs in another
step of annealing at 1.4 mbar H2. Carbon profile measurements
correlate reduction in density of SNGFs and the depletion of intrinsic
carbon.

4 Experimental Methods
In this work,
a CVD furnace with an 11 cm inner diameter of the
quartz tube has been used. Details of the setup can be found in ref (34). 2 × 3 cm2 sized Cu foils (25 μm-thick, <0.2 μm roughness, 99.8%
metallic pure LiB grade, P.N. B1-SBS, purchased from Taiwan Copper
Foil Co. LTD.) were used for each annealing experiment. To remove
ambient gas from the system, the CVD system has been pumped down and
then flushed with argon several times. Then, at the base pressure
of 5 × 10–2 mbar, the system was heated up
from room temperature to 1000 °C in 40 min, followed by the annealing
phase at 1000 °C. During the whole duration of thermal treatment
of copper, only hydrogen (99.999% pure) and argon (99.999% pure) were
flowing in the system. To exclude carbon contamination from the pump
oil, a dry pump (Agilent TriScroll 300) has been used to pump the
chamber and to exclude cross-contamination from an external carbon
precursor, new quartz tubes were used in this work that have never
been used for growth experiments.

To characterize the surface
of Cu samples after the thermal treatment,
we used optical microscopy and SEM (Zeiss Gemini 1530). Then, to measure
the depth profile of the carbon inside the Cu foils, ToF-SIMS technique
has been implemented (TOF SIMS 5, ION-TOF GmbH). For the sputtering
cycle, we used 2 keV Cs+ ions with 70 nA current and a
25 keV, 1.5 pA Bi3+ ion beam is used to do SIMS measurement
after each sputtering cycle. The cycle time of the Bi3+ ion current was 100 μs in the interlaced mode. To avoid the
generated spectra from the edges, the SIMS signal acquired from 150
× 150 μm2 co-centered with a 400 × 400
μm2 sputtered region is recorded. The signals detected
from the top 1.9 nm of the Cu foils were excluded from the measurement
to avoid the portion of adsorbed organic molecules from ambient air.
The local minimum of the CH– ions’ intensity
during depth-profiling determines the depth of exclusion, 1.9 nm.
