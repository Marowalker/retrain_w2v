A mild and efficient
amination of arenes with azodicarboxylates
using potassium bisulfate (KHSO4) as the catalyst in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
has been developed. This protocol allowed the amination of a broad
range of arenes leading to corresponding hydrazides in good to excellent
yields.

Introduction
The development of
efficient and novel methods creating the C—N
bond on aromatics is always at the forefront of research in synthetic
organic chemistry due to the omnipresence of arylamines in a variety
of pharmaceuticals and natural products.1 While many classical transformations have been established,2 direct amination of aryl C—H bonds has
been pursued as a more step-economical route. Important progress has
been realized in the direct C–H amination of arenes to C—N
bonds in the past decades,3 but the requirement
for a coordinating directing group limits the potential substrate
scope. Therefore, the development of the C–H amination of arenes
without the aid of directing groups increased in recent years.4 Among them, electrophilic amination of simple
arenes is one of the most useful protocols. Different amination systems
using azodicarboxylates in the presence of Lewis acids or Brønsted
acids have been developed in the past decades.5 However, these reaction systems are efficient only to electron-rich
arenes. In 2001, the Kim group described the first example of electrophilic
amination of unactivated arenes (Scheme 1a).6 However,
conditions are very harsh, using a stoichiometric amount of super
acid TfOH as the catalyst and trifluoroacetic acid as the solvent.
The amination of electron-rich and electron-poor arenes with azodicarboxylates
has been reported in the presence of metal catalysts (Scheme 1b).7 Although effective, these reactions suffer from one or more disadvantages
such as the use of sensitive and expensive metal catalysts (AuCl3, RuCl3). Furthermore, the poor reactivity of electron-poor
arenes needs to use expensive electron-deficient bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)azodicarboxylate
as the nitrogen source.

Scheme 1 Direct Amination of Simple Arenes Using
Azodicarboxylates
Considering previous results, we believe that it is still
desirable
to develop an efficient system for the direct amination of electron-rich
and -poor arenes under mild conditions without a metal catalyst and
with cheap reagents.

Fluorinated alcohols, particularly 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP), have been shown to be beneficial as solvents, cosolvents,
or additives in organic synthesis with a nearly unique set of properties
(strong hydrogen-bond donating ability, high ionizing power, mild
acidity, and low nucleophilicity).8 Recently,
the amination of anilines with azodicarboxylates in HFIP under mild
conditions has been reported by our group (Scheme 1c).9 Given the
importance of the amination of aromatics, we sought to optimize conditions
for aromatics of weak reactivity (Scheme 1d). We turned toward mild conditions that
are easy to implement in the presence of weaker acid catalysts than
TFA or TfOH because HFIP can further enhance their acidity by the
hydrogen network.10 We focused on cheap
and available inorganic salt KHSO4, which showed its efficiency
in the Friedel–Crafts benzylation reaction.11

Results and Discussion
We studied first the direct
amination of p-xylene 1a with diethyl
azodicarboxylate (DEAD) 2a as
the model system (Table 1). We checked the reaction in HFIP without catalyst. After 16 h,
the product 3aa was isolated in 26% yield (entry 1).
To our satisfaction, 10 mol % KHSO4 can improve the yield
to 91% in only 2 h (entry 2). Using NaHSO4 as the catalyst
led to the same result (entry 3). A dramatic drop in yield to 38%
was observed when Na2SO4 is used instead of
KHSO4 (entry 4). This experiment shows the involvement
of the OH function in the catalysis of the amination reaction. Potassium
bisulfate is a green, cheap, and available inorganic salt that is
a strong acid, the pKa is 1.9, and the
acidity was further enhanced by the hydrogen network formed with HFIP.
Indeed, when reaction was performed neat without HFIP, no reaction
occurred (entry 5). In addition, when 1.0 equiv of p-xylene was used, 81% yield of product 3aa with 12%
of the bisaminated product was isolated (entry 6). Next, the effect
of different solvents has been investigated. Unexpectedly, only a
trace of the product was observed in TFE (entry 7). Other classical
solvents such as EtOH, DCM, THF, H2O, CH3CN,
and CH3NO2 did not produce a detectable amount
of product. Surprisingly, strong protic acid TFA (pKa −0.3) leads to a poor result (entry 8). Of course,
the super acid TfOH (pKa −14.7), which is
more expensive and less easy to handle, led to the product 3aa (94%) in 5 min (entry 9).

The substrate
scope of arenes has been examined with the optimized
conditions (Table 1, entry 2). Results are reported in Table 2. Mesitylene, o-, and m-xylene were aminated to produce the corresponding aryl
hydrazides 3ba–3da in excellent yields with a
single regioisomer. From the phenol, the corresponding aminated product 3ea in favor of the para position (p/o ratio of 7.5:1) was isolated in 82%
yield. Likewise, the amination of anisole to corresponding aminated
product 3fa (p/o ratio
4.9:1) resulted in 96% yield. The para-substituted
anisole was aminated at the ortho/meta position (o/m ratio 9.6:1) (3ga).
The amination of the toluene gave corresponding mono- (3ha isolated in 86% yield) and diamination products (mono/di ratio of 8.6:1). In addition, corresponding
aminated derivatives 3ia and 3ja were obtained
in good yields and a para selectivity. From naphthalene
derivatives 2k and 2l, the only corresponding
aryl hydrazides 3ka and 3la(12) were isolated in 93 and 95% yields, respectively. For benzene,
a 1,4-bisaminated product 3ma was obtained as a single
regioisomer. From electron-deficient arenes such as halobenzenes,
reactions required 1 equiv of catalyst and 48 h to give moderate to
low yields of corresponding aryl hydrazides 3na–3qa.13 The present KHSO4/HFIP
system did not work with the electron-poor arenes such as benzotrifluoride,
nitrobenzene, or benzonitrile.

Arenes with
DEADa
a Conditions: 1b–1q (1.5 mmol,
3.0 equiv), 2a (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and
KHSO4 (10 mol %) were dissolved in HFIP (2 mL) and stirred
at r.t. for a specified period. Isolated yield. Ratios were determined
by isolated yields of regioisomers.

b Combined yield of regioisomers;
ratio was determined by 1H NMR.

c 1 equiv of catalyst was used.

Next, several azodicarboxylates
with different ester substituents
were subjected to the amination reaction under the standard conditions
(Table 3). Diisopropyl
and bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)azodicarboxylates 2b and 2c reacted smoothly with p-xylene 1a to yield the corresponding aryl hydrazides 3ab and 3ac in excellent yields. The reaction of p-xylene 1a with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate 2d gave aminated product 3ad in modest yield. For di-t-butyl azodicarboxylate 2e, the corresponding
aryl hydrazide 3ae is present only in trace amounts because
of its decomposition in the KHSO4/HFIP system.14 With 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione 2f, the reaction worked to afford the corresponding aryl hydrazide 3af in 65% yield.

Table 3 Amination of p-Xylene
with Different Azodicarboxylatesa
a Conditions: 1a (1.5
mmol, 3.0 equiv), 2a–2f (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv),
and KHSO4 (10 mol %) were dissolved in HFIP (2 mL) and
stirred at r.t. for a specified period. Isolated yield.

The association of KHSO4 with HFIP leads to a strong
organocatalyst that acts as an excellent H-bond donor and activates
the carbonyl group of the DEAD 2, increasing its electrophilicity
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Increased
Electrophilicity of 2
To demonstrate the utility of this protocol, the reaction
was performed
on a gram scale (Scheme 3). The reaction of p-xylene 1a with
DEAD 2a proceeded mildly in 2 h to afford the corresponding
aryl hydrazide 3aa in 94% yield. HFIP, which was previously
recovered containing p-xylene, can be reused. In
addition, the hydrazine 3aa can be cleaved using the
methyl bromoacetate/Cs2CO3 system15 and converted to amine 4 in 90%
yield.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a very
efficient and mild amination
reaction of arenes with azodicarboxylates by using a catalytic amount
of KHSO4 in HFIP. This process led to a broad range of
arenes, including electron-poor arenes. Additional advantages of KHSO4 are its low cost, ready availability, and easy removal in
an aqueous workup. From this new efficient system, other applications
are currently underway in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
was performed on silica gel 60F-250 (0.26 mm thickness) plates. The
plates were visualized with UV light (254 nm) or with a 3.5% solution
of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol or with a solution of KMnO4 in water. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained
from Waters LCT Premier (ESI/TOF). Flash chromatography (FC) was performed
on Merck 60 silica gel (230–400 mesh). Melting points were
determined on a Kofler melting point apparatus. NMR spectra were measured
on an Ultra field AVANCE 300 (1H, 300 MHz; 13C, 75 MHz) spectrometer. Unless otherwise stated, NMR data were obtained
under ambient temperature conditions. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane
with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (dimethyl sulfoxide:
δ 2.50 ppm, chloroform: δ 7.26 ppm, methanol: δ
3.31 ppm). Chemical shifts for 13C NMR spectra are reported
in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane with the solvent
as the internal standard (dimethyl sulfoxide: δ 39.52 ppm, chloroform:
δ 77.16 ppm, methanol: δ 49.00 ppm). Data are reported
as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet,
dd = doublet of doublets, t = triplet, appt = apparent triplet, q
= quartet, m = multiplet, br = broad signal), coupling constant (Hz),
and integration.
