Hydrogen
boride (HB) or hydrogenated borophene sheets are recently
realized two-dimensional materials that are composed of only two light
elements, boron and hydrogen. However, their catalytic activity has
not been experimentally analyzed. Herein, we report the catalytic
activity of HB sheets in ethanol reforming. HB sheets catalyze the
conversion of ethanol to ethylene and water above 493 K with high
selectivity, independent of the contact time, and with an apparent
activation energy of 102.8 ± 5.5 kJ/mol. Hence, we identify that
HB sheets act as solid-acid catalysts.

==== Body
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
materials have great potential for application
as catalysts because of their unique properties such as large surface
areas and novel electronic states.1,2 Among 2D materials,
boron-related materials have unique characteristics different from
other 2D materials in that they have polymorphisms,3−5 i.e., there
are a wide variety of stable 2D phases owing to the capability to
form multicenter bonding configurations of boron.6 Single monoatomic 2D boron (borophene) layers have been
fabricated on solid surfaces with several different stable structures,7 which is consistent with theoretical predictions
regarding polymorphs of borophene.8−10

These polymorph
characteristics of 2D boron sheets provide an opportunity
to optimize the catalytic performance by tuning the bonding configurations
of the 2D boron network. For example, it has been recently reported
that boron nanosheets exfoliated from bulk boron exhibited efficient
electrocatalytic performance for NH3 formation from N2 in neutral media.11 Recent experimental
and theoretical studies also showed that α-phase molybdenum
diboride (α-MoB2) comprising noble metal-free borophene
subunits exhibits superefficient electrocatalytic properties for the
hydrogen evolution reaction.12 What we
expect here is that these observed catalytic performances will be
further improved by optimizing the electronic structure of 2D boron
sheets through the adjusting of the 2D boron bonding-network configurations
as well as conventional doping and/or composite formation.

This
catalyst design concept with an attractive polymorph 2D boron
character can be extended to hydrogenated borophene (referred to as
borophane) sheets, since the polymorph 2D phases of borophane have
been theoretically predicted.5 However,
the catalytic performance of borophane has not been experimentally
analyzed, to the best of our knowledge.

Recently, we revealed
that a type of borophane sheet, the hydrogen
boride (HB) sheet, with an empirical formula of H1B1, can be experimentally prepared by exfoliation and complete
ion-exchange between protons and magnesium cations in magnesium diboride
(MgB2), with an average yield of 42.3% at room temperature.13 Our extensive analysis revealed that the prepared
HB sheets did not show any long-range order but have a local structure
of a hexagonal boron network with bridge hydrogens, as shown in Figure 1a.13 A recent analysis using soft X-ray absorption and emission
spectroscopy at the B K-shell also supports this view and shows the
semimetallicity of HB sheets.14 HB sheets
release their hydrogen content as H2 molecules in a wide
temperature range from 423 to 1473 K.13 The hydrogen in HB has a character of protons (H+) rather
than that of hydrides (H–), based on the B 1s core-level
states, density functional theory calculations, and the Hammett acidity
function (H0, acid strength); the H0 of HB sheets is below 1.5 and above 0.43.13 From this viewpoint, we can regard HB sheets
as proton-covered 2D boron sheets. We can thus expect that HB sheets
would exhibit intriguing catalytic performance for proton-related
chemical reactions and would be used as theoretically predicted hydrogen-storage
materials15,16 and in batteries.17−19 In this work,
we therefore examined the catalytic activity of HB sheets in the ethanol-reforming
reaction to clarify their acid/base catalytic property and performance.

of HB sheets in powder form and schematic of the
proposed local structure.13 (b) Conversion
of ethanol vs temperature. The results for HB, B2O3, and MgB2 are plotted for various W/F (g·min/mmol) conditions (contact time, weight
of the catalyst divided by the flow rate of C2H5OH).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1b shows
the conversion of ethanol as a function of temperature at various W/F conditions (contact time); W/F (g·min/mmol) is the weight of
the catalyst (g) divided by the flow rate of C2H5OH (mmol/min). The conversion was estimated from the total amount
of hydrocarbons in the product (see the details in the Supporting Information). In every case, we heated
the sample at 573 K under Ar flow for 1 h prior to the measurement.
It is clear that HB sheets exhibit distinct ethanol conversion, whereas
MgB2 (starting material for the synthesis of HB) and B2O3 (product obtained by heating B(OH)3, which is a byproduct in HB sheet synthesis, to 400 K or more) exhibit
no ethanol conversion. The conversion by the HB sheets increases with
an increase in W/F; it is 90% at
573 K and W/F = 27.2 g·min/mmol.
The conversion remains constant for a long period. As an example,
the conversion at 573 K and W/F =
7.3 g·min/mmol as a function of the reaction time is shown by
blue circles in Figure 2a. In this case, the total amount of hydrocarbons at 13.4 h is 3.2
mmol, which is approximately half of the total B atom numbers of used
HB sheets. We also estimated the conversion from the ethanol consumption,
as shown by the red triangles in Figure 2a (see the details in the Supporting Information). The conversion calculated from the
hydrocarbon production and that from the ethanol consumption are almost
the same at 12 h (approximately 40%), indicating that the product
hydrocarbon does not accumulate on the catalyst HB sheets during the
steady-state catalytic process. These results hence indicate that
the HB sheets catalytically convert ethanol. It is notable that pretreatment
heating at 573 K causes inevitable hydrogen release from HB as H2.13 The maximum amount of released
hydrogen at 573 K could be estimated as approximately 33–50
atom % of HB based on the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) results13 (see the details in the Supporting Information). It is implying that the stoichiometry
of the HB sheets showing the catalytic activity was not H:B = 1:1
but approximately H:B = 1:2.5 ± 0.5 (if they were forming a uniform
structure).

Figure 2 (a) Conversion of ethanol on HB sheets as a function of reaction
time at 573 K and W/F = 7.3 g·min/mmol,
estimated from hydrocarbon production (blue circles) and ethanol consumption
(red triangles). (b) Selectivity vs reaction time.

We detected the catalytically converted products using gas
chromatography;
they were predominantly ethylene and water, together with other products
such as methane, ethane, and a trace amount of acetaldehyde, as shown
in Figure 2b. The selectivity
of ethylene was relatively low at the early stage, i.e., 0–4
h reaction time; this could be ascribed to the presence of surplus
hydrogen in HB compared with the amount of hydrogen at the steady-state
in HB at 573 K (details in the Supporting Information). We observed the same characteristics at all of the measured temperatures
and W/F conditions, as shown in Figure 3a,b; i.e., C2H4 was always the main product, and the selectivity
for the obtained total hydrocarbon was almost the same. These results
indicate that the major catalytic reaction of ethanol reforming by
the HB sheets is the dehydration reaction: C2H5OH → C2H4 + H2O. It is known
that if a catalyst promotes the dehydration reaction of ethanol, it
is a solid-acid; however, if the dehydrogenation reaction occurs,
producing an acetaldehyde, the catalyst is a base catalyst. The HB
sheets are therefore solid-acid catalysts, which is consistent with
the H0 of the HB sheets (below 1.5 and
above 0.43)13 in terms of the acidic character.

Figure 3 (a) Selectivity
of ethanol reforming by HB as a function of temperature
at W/F = 6.7 g·min/mmol. (b)
Selectivity of ethanol reforming by HB at 573 K and W/F = 6.7, 13.6, and 27.2 g·min/mmol.

Figure 4 shows the
Arrhenius plot of the ethanol-reforming reaction rate k, which was calculated by assuming a first-order reaction, as k = (C2H5OH conversion [%])/100 ×
(C2H5OH flux [mol/s])/(HB amount [mol]), for
the results under various W/F conditions
with the HB sheets. As the obtained linear lines are almost the same
and they are independent of W/F,
the reaction can be (at least apparently) considered a first-order
reaction. To determine the exact reaction order and mechanism, further
kinetic analysis is required. From the slope and the section, the
apparent activation energy Ea and pre-exponential
factor A were estimated to be 102.8 ± 5.5 kJ/mol
and 3.5 × 104 s–1, respectively.
The derived Ea is comparable to the reported
activation energies for the catalytic dehydration of ethanol over
Al2O3 (53–155 kJ/mol),20,21 the Lewis acidic Zr-KIT-6 catalyst (79 kJ/mol),22 silica–alumina (125.5 kJ/mol),23 and microporous Fe-ZSM-5 (137.7–271.1 kJ/mol).24 The formation rate of ethylene on our HB catalyst
at 573 K and W/F = 7.3 g·min/mmol
was 2.4 ± 0.1 mmol/g·h (Figure 2). Although this is not the formation rate
at the optimal catalytic condition, here, we compare it with those
of the other reported catalysts. Chen and co-workers reported that
the formation rate of ethylene from ethanol using the commercial SynDol
(Al2O3–MgO/SiO2) catalyst
was 7.8 mmol/g·h at 591 K, with a weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) of 0.23 h–1 in a fixed-bed reactor (this
value is calculated using the reported yield of the ethylene, which
is 0.22 g/gcat·h).25 They also reported
a higher formation rate of 535 mmol/g·h on Ti/γ-Al2O3 at 633 K and WHSV of 26 h–1 using the microreactor (calculated using a value of 15 g/gcat·h).25 The formation rate of HB sheets is, thus, lower
than that of the state-of-the-art catalysts but is in the same order
as that of the commercial SynDol catalyst.

Figure 4 Arrhenius plot of the
ethanol-reforming reaction rate (k) in the presence
of HB sheets for W/F = 27.2, 13.6,
and 6.7 g·min/mmol.

Finally, we herein discuss
the possible reaction mechanism and
active sites as well as the acid property of the HB sheets. In the
case of ethanol reforming on a zeolite catalyst,26−32 diethyl ether (C2H5OC2H5) is formed as a result of a two-molecule reaction. Diethyl ether
then converts to ethylene at strong Brønsted acid sites. The
number and the strength of strong Brønsted acid sites in the
catalyst are thus reported to determine the catalytic activity for
ethylene formation. Since HB sheets show weaker H0 (1.5 ≥ H0 ≥
0.43)13 compared with that of zeolites
(e.g., −3.0 ≥ H0 ≥
−8.2 of H-Zeolite),33 we can expect
the formation of diethyl ether rather than ethylene on HB sheets,
based on the trend of zeolite. However, we observed ethylene instead
of diethyl ether on the HB sheets (Figures 2 and 3). Thus, the
reaction is considered to proceed as a single molecule reaction via
the formation of an ethoxy (C2H5O−) species
rather than the two-molecule reaction via the formation of diethyl
ether. Indeed, the derived apparent activation energy (102.8 ±
5.5 kJ/mol) from Figure 4 is similar to that for the decomposition of the ethoxy intermediate
generated from ethanol on a zeolite (122 ± 3 kJ/mol).34 The ethoxy species can thus be formed prior
to ethylene on HB; this will be investigated using infrared spectroscopy
in our future work. Concerning the active site, the bridge-type hydrogen
in the HB sheets and/or terminal-type hydrogen at the edge of the
HB sheets can be expected to act as the Brønsted acid sites.
However, as described above, the stoichiometry of the HB sheets used
in this work for the catalytic activity measurements is not H:B =
1:1 due to the inevitable hydrogen release as H2 at the
pretreatment heating of 573 K (release as much as 33–50% of
hydrogen in HB). Thus, we cannot simply assign the hydrogen atoms
of the outermost surface (bridge- and/or edge-type of hydrogens) of
HB (Figure 1a) as the
active sites. There is a possibility that the boron atom that does
not bond with hydrogen acts as the Lewis acid site if a hydrogen vacancy
is created locally and the boron atom adopts a simple sp2 bonding configuration with surrounding boron atoms (Figure 1a) without any electron in
its pz orbital. On the other hand, if
the charges in the HB sheets are delocalized well to supply electrons
to the pz orbital of a bare sp2-bonded boron atom (at hydrogen vacancy), the boron atom may act
as a Brønsted base, similar to the lattice oxygen in zeolite,
and promote the dehydrogenation of ethoxy to form ethylene. According
to our catalytic activity measurements for the HB sheets without pretreatment
heating (Figure S4), the selectivity is
different from that shown in Figure 3. This difference in selectivity can be attributed
to the difference in the hydrogen amount in HB, as in the case of
the origin of the induction period shown in Figure 2b (see the details in the Supporting Information). We can hence at least classify that
the HB and heated HB (hydrogen-deficient-HB) have different catalytic
properties (i.e., different acid sites). However, the active sites
cannot be solely determined by our current experimental results. At
least it should be clarified whether the hydrogen-deficient HB consists
of a uniform stoichiometric structure or defective structure. Further
investigation is thus required to determine the exact active sites
of the HB solid-acid catalyst, e.g., the careful structure characterization,
infrared spectroscopy analysis with pyridine, NH3, and
CO2 adsorption, and H0 measurements
with quantitative density, as a function of the pretreatment heating
temperature (i.e., hydrogen amount in HB).

Conclusions
We
found that hydrogen boride or hydrogenated borophene sheets
catalyze the conversion of ethanol to ethylene and water above 493
K, with high selectivity, independent of the contact time, and an
apparent activation energy of 102.8 ± 5.5 kJ/mol. We hence consider
hydrogenated borophene sheets to be novel, nonmetal, and two-dimensional
solid-acid catalysts that have great potential for application as
hydrogen-storage materials and in batteries.

Experimental Section
Materials
HB sheets were prepared using a previously
reported ion-exchange method.13 Specifically,
MgB2 powder (1.0 g, 99%, Rare Metallic Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) in acetonitrile (300 mL, 99.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries
Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was mixed with a solution of an ion-exchange resin
(60 mL, Amberlite IR120B hydrogen form, Organo Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
and acetonitrile (200 mL) in a Schlenk flask under a nitrogen atmosphere,
where water inclusion is sensitive to the product35 and thus careful removal of water was done beforehand.
This mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 2
days at room temperature. The supernatant was then kept for 1 day
at 255 K to physically separate the byproduct B(OH)3. Dried
HB sheets were prepared by heating the resulting liquid at 343 K while
pumping with a liquid nitrogen trap. For all of the syntheses, we
carefully confirmed the product by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
to confirm the absence of Mg and the presence of negatively charged
B without oxidized B as reported previously.13 Moreover, we recently confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
that our HB sheets mostly consist of a few to several tens of layers.
The details of AFM with statistical analysis will be published in
our future work.

Catalytic Activity Measurements
To determine the catalytic
activity, gaseous ethanol was introduced into the HB sheets using
an argon carrier gas under atmospheric pressure in a homemade fixed-bed
flow reactor. The product gas was then analyzed using a thermal conductivity
detector in a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped
with Molecular Sieve 5A and Porapak Q at the downstream end of the
reactor. The catalytic conversion was estimated from the total amount
of hydrocarbon production using the following relation  As shown in Figure 2a, the conversion was also
estimated from ethanol consumption as follows  The selectivity was estimated using the following
relation  The catalytic activity was determined under
various W/F conditions (g·min/mmol),
which is the weight of the catalyst (g) divided by the flow rate of
C2H5OH (mmol/min); W/F was controlled by adjusting the flow rate of C2H5OH and the weight of the sample. The W/F conditions used in this work are listed in Table S1.
