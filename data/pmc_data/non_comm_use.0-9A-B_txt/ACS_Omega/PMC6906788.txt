Nonviral gene delivery has seen major progress in the
last two
decades owing to facile synthesis, low toxicity, and ease of modification
of nanocarriers that take nucleic acids to cells and tissues. Gene
delivery nanocomplexes need to reach the target locations in significant
amounts by overcoming multiple barriers. While the importance of nanocomplex
stability, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and nuclear
localization has been studied extensively, the role of cellular retention
and recycling of these nanocomplexes is less understood in the context
of gene delivery. In this study, we used different DNA carriers and
made efforts to understand the role played by cellular retention in
determining their gene delivery efficiency across multiple cell lines.
In addition, we also analyzed whether state of complexation and localization
of the nanocomplexes play a role in conjunction with cellular retention.
We observed higher transfection efficiencies for nanocomplexes showing
better retention, lower unpackaging, and low recycling. Our data also
suggests that nanocomplexes made of peptides with terminal cysteine
modification show enhanced retention and transfection efficiency compared
to their counterparts with no terminal cysteine. Overall, the work
highlights myriad of factors to be considered for improving gene delivery
efficiency of nanocomplexes.

Introduction
Over the years, research in gene therapy
has expanded its scope
to encompass the entire gamut from replacing an absent or defective
genetic material with its functional form up to the realm of alteration
of expression (increase or decrease) of a particular gene by delivering
appropriate nucleic acids.1,2 Although gene therapy
holds great potential as a powerful tool for altering gene expression
in patients, the challenges of safety and efficiency of delivery still
persist. One of the basic requirements of efficient gene therapy is
appropriate gene delivery vector systems used for introducing the
therapeutic nucleic acids. Gene delivery vector systems can be broadly
classified as viral (adenoviral, retroviral, helper-dependent adenoviral
systems, hybrid adenoviral systems, lentiviral, herpes simplex, pox
virus, Epstein–Barr virus-associated, etc.) and nonviral (cationic
lipids, different cationic polymers, lipid polymers, peptides, microinjection,
DNA bombardment, etc.) methods, with each class having its advantages
and limitations. Viral methods are considered more promising owing
to their better transduction efficiency and long-term expression;
however, they suffer from undesired effects of random integration
and associated problems.3,4 On the other hand, nonviral
vectors, where the nucleic acid is complexed with the carrier to form
nanometer-sized complexes, could be advantageous because of their
lower immunogenicity, ease of synthesis, and prospects of modifications
for better organ targeting.5−7 Despite the efforts toward the
development of a number of nonviral methods of gene delivery with
the ultimate goal of single administration replacement of nonfunctional
gene, it is hard to design delivery methods with high efficiency in
vitro and in vivo, effective targeting, and absence of any side effects.

In the case of nonviral gene delivery, the vector–nucleic
acid nanocomplex has to overcome different in vivo barriers like interaction
with serum proteins and destabilization by nucleases.8,9 Even if the complex reaches the desired cells, there are a number
of intracellular barriers like endosomal entrapment, balance of tight
packaging and intracellular cargo release, cytoplasmic stability,
and barriers for nuclear entry.1,10−12 Most of the current studies focus on overcoming these barriers by
chemical modifications on the carrier, design of multifunctional carriers,
application of different surface coatings, and so on.13−16 However, although significant advances have been made in these directions,
nonviral vectors which are as efficient as the viral ones are yet
to be developed. This indicates that the different barriers for nonviral
gene delivery are not completely understood.17

One barrier that has often been overlooked in the literature
is
the problem of cellular retention of nanocomplexes. After entering
the cells, the nanocomplexes are recycled through exocytosis, which
can result in lower cellular retention with a possible effect on gene
delivery.18 Low cellular retention is likely
to cause removal of the nanocomplexes from the cell, which will eventually
allow less nucleic acid to reach the desired cellular locale. Unlike
in the case of gene delivery nanocomplexes, exocytosis of inorganic
nanoparticles has been studied extensively in the literature.19−22 There is a large volume of literature which analyzes the role of
shape, size, surface modification, uptake, and egress routes of these
nanoparticles to derive some parameters that can be controlled to
improve cellular retention.23−25 On the other hand, there are
only few studies in the literature on the role of exocytosis in gene
delivery.18,26,27 Isolated reports
discuss exocytosis of both uptaken siRNA and plasmid DNA from cells
and its effect on the functional activity.18,28 For example, electron microscopy has been employed to demonstrate
that polyethyleneimine (PEI)–DNA nanocomplexes and poly-l-lysine–DNA complexes are recycled from airway epithelial
cells through exosome-like pathways.15 In
an extensive study, Sahay et al. have shown using fluorescent probes
and flow cytometry that there is significant endocytic recycling of
si-RNA lipid nanocomplexes in HeLa cells.28 Up to 70% of the internalized si-RNA is recycled back and multivesicular
bodies (MVB) are involved in the cellular egress. When HeLa cells
were treated with radiolabeled poly(ethyleneimine)–DNA complexes,
there was exocytosis of the complexes as indicated by decrease in
intracellular radioactivity over time and concomitant increase of
the same in the supernatant fraction.27 Further, quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR)-based estimation
of amounts of exocytosed and retained plasmid DNA inside cells demonstrated
the highest retention profile in the case of poly(ethyleneimine)-mediated
delivery among the vectors studied.18 However,
there was a poor correlation between transgene expression and retention
of plasmid DNA in this case. On the other hand, transgene expression
of plasmid DNA delivered using PEI (polyethyleneimine) in sponges
was reported to show a significant correlation with plasmid retention.26

While such isolated efforts aim to understand
correlations among
exocytosis, cellular retention, and gene delivery, as described above,
there are also few efforts to characterize recycling pathways of the
nanocomplexes.29 Available literature suggests
involvement of multiple recycling pathways for different nanocomplexes,
for example, early recycling of poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) nanoparticle30 and MVB-mediated recycling
of lipid-siRNA complexes.28 There are also
limited efforts to analyze whether strategies to prevent exocytosis
and increase cellular retention can help in drug/gene delivery. Silencing
the NPC-1 gene which is associated with the surface of multivesicular
late endosome has been found to enhance cellular retention of lipid
nanoparticle–siRNA complexes.28 There
are also studies on whether small molecules which can impair cholesterol
metabolism can help in cellular accumulation of nanocomplexes.31 However, these studies are few and far between.
A comprehensive picture of the correlation between cellular retention
and transfection efficiency and whether it depends on factors like
nature of the cationic carrier, nanocomplex size and charge, localization
of the nanocomplex, and other factors has not yet emerged.

In
this study, we have taken a number of cationic vectors, which
are either developed in our laboratory or commercially available.
We have analyzed the cellular uptake, retention, and exocytosis of
nanocomplexes prepared using these agents in four different cell lines
using q-PCR studies and confocal microscopy. The intracellular state
of the nanocomplexes and localization have also been analyzed. Comparisons
in the retention of the DNA and its state and localization were made
across different agents and different cell lines and analyzed with
respect to the transfection efficiencies.

Results
Choice of Carriers and Characterization of the Nanocomplexes
Four amphipathic peptides previously designed in our lab M1, M3,
M4, and M932,33 were selected along with poly(ethyleneimine)
(PEI) (cationic polymer) and Lipofectamine (lipid-based reagent) for
making the nanocomplexes. M1 was derived from human protein phosphatase
E1; M3 represents a secondary amphipathic peptide derived from M1,
which was designed to improve the transfection efficiency of M1 by
increasing the number of positive charges;32 M4 is the primary amphipathic variant of M3; and M9 represents terminal
cysteine-modified M3.33 While M1 has been
shown to have low transfection efficiency, all of the derived sequences
have been shown to have improved transfection efficiency.32 PEI and Lipofectamine are efficient commercial
transfection agents. The details of all of the carriers used are listed
in Table 1.

a Size and ζ-potential were
measured in two separate experiments each comprising three measurements
of 12 runs.

Nanocomplexes were prepared at a charge ratio of 5
between the
pMIR plasmid and the different carriers, as described in Materials and Methods. The nanocomplexes were characterized
for their shape, size, and surface charge using Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) (Figure S1) and Dynamic Light Scattering
(Table 1). All of the
nanocomplexes appeared to be more or less spherical in shape, as indicated
by the AFM images, and homogeneous in nature as indicated by the low
PDI values (Table 1). The size of M1 nanocomplexes was found to be around 400 nm, indicating
relatively loose complexation. Nanocomplexes formed with M3, M4, PEI,
and Lipofectamine showed sizes larger than 100 nm at this charge ratio,
while M9 peptide showed the highest complexation with hydrodynamic
radii of about 80 nm and positive surface charge (Table 1). These are along expected
lines and comparable to the values obtained with the nanocomplexes
in our earlier studies carried out at different preparative conditions.32,33 All of the nanocomplexes except those formed with Lipofectamine
were found to have positive surface charge (Table 1).

Uptake of the Nanocomplexes
Cellular uptake of all
of the nanocomplexes in different cell lines was measured using the
protocol described in Materials and Methods. Four different cell lines were chosen for the study to cover wide
spectra of cellular origin. The uptake was monitored for over a time
period of 4 h to ensure saturation conditions (data not shown). After
the incubation, the amount of DNA left over in the media was measured
using q-PCR. Since the leftover DNA in the media is a measure of the
DNA in the nanocomplexes that was not taken up by the cells, it can
be used to calculate the cellular uptake efficiency of the different
carriers. Figure 1a
depicts the DNA content in the leftover fraction after a period of
4 h. Figure 1b shows
the corresponding intracellular DNA calculated by subtracting the
amount of DNA in the media from the total amount of DNA delivered.

Figure 1 (a) q-PCR-based
estimation of pMIR plasmid in leftover media: B16-F10,
HaCaT, CHOK-1, and HEK-293 cells were incubated with different nanocomplexes
for 4 h, followed by harvesting the leftover treatment media and q-PCR-based
estimation of plasmid DNA. (b) Amounts of plasmid DNA inside the cells
after 4 h incubation (DNA estimated in media fraction was subtracted
from the total amount in each case, for estimating respective cellular
uptake).

Nanocomplexes formed by M1, M3, and M4 peptides
showed lower uptake
in almost all of the cases compared to the other carriers. PEI nanocomplexes
showed intermediate uptake, while efficient uptake was observed for
M9 nanocomplexes and Lipofectamine nanocomplexes. Overall, B16-F10
cells showed the highest uptake of nanocomplexes, whereas the least
uptake was observed in HaCaT cells.

Cellular Retention of Plasmid DNA with Time
We monitored
the retention of DNA delivered through the nanocomplexes over a period
of 8 h through q-PCR-based estimation using the protocol described
in the Materials and Methods section. Figure 2a–d depicts
the trends in cellular retention of all of the samples in the four
different cell lines. We have in parallel measured the presence of
DNA at the same time points in the media fraction to get an estimate
of the amount of DNA that is thrown out of the cells during this time
period. The corresponding amounts in the media fraction are shown
in Figure 2e–h.
The 0 h reading in all of the cases denotes the DNA present in the
cells when the uptake is saturated. The media is replaced, and the
time course of cellular retention and exocytosis is followed for 8
h from this time point. In selected cases, we also monitored the retention
till 16 h (data not shown). We did not observe any significant change
in retention beyond 8 h; hence, we present the data till this time
point in all of the cases. Since the uptake of the nanocomplexes is
different in different cell lines and with different carriers, as
shown in Figure 1,
we have also normalized the retention amount with respect to the uptake
of nanocomplexes in each case (see Figure 3).

fraction and media

incubated with different nanocomplexes for 4 h, followed by q-PCR-based
estimation of pMIR plasmid at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h in both media and cellular
fractions. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of
at least three independent experiments.

Figure 3 Normalized cellular fraction retention trends in different
cell
lines. (a) B16-F10, (b) CHOK-1, (c) HaCaT, and (d) HEK-293 cells were
incubated with different nanocomplexes for 4 h, followed by q-PCR-based
estimation of pMIR plasmid at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. Normalization was
performed by dividing the estimated cellular fraction amount at any
time points with estimated amounts of that nanocomplex at 0 h after
media change. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
of at least three independent experiments.

For all nanocomplexes, there was reduction in amount
of plasmid
DNA present inside the cells over time (Figure 2). Nanocomplexes formed with Lipofectamine,
M9, and PEI showed comparatively higher retention and slower cellular
egress, while a higher loss of DNA from the cells was observed in
M1, M3, and M4 nanocomplexes over time. M9 (cysteine-modified peptide
nanocomplex) exhibited a good retention in HaCaT cells as well, which
otherwise shows less retention. B16-F10 melanoma cells and CHO-K1
cells exhibited comparatively higher retention of nanocomplexes in
general. When the presence of DNA in the media was analyzed, it was
observed that for all nanocomplexes, the amount of estimated plasmid
DNA increased with time in the media, indicating cellular egress.
The trends matched with that observed in the case of cellular retention.
Since the uptake of the nanocomplexes was different, we analyzed the
data for cellular retention by normalizing against the cellular uptake
(Figure 3) as well.
While M1, M3, and M4 showed the maximum cellular egress by 8 h, the
best retention was observed in Lipofectamine in some cell lines and
by M9 or PEI in some others. This indicates that the overall amounts
retained in the cells (irrespective of the uptake) are higher for
M9 and the two commercial agents compared to M1, M3, and M4. Moreover,
in most cases, the loss of DNA was quite sharp in the early time points
for M3, M4, and M1, indicating considerable early recycling.

We further validated this by carrying out fixed cell confocal microscopy
using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled nanocomplexes (as
described in Materials and Methods) for M9
and Lipofectamine nanocomplexes in B16-F10 cells. Hoechst was used
for staining the nucleus, and Cell Mask Orange was used for staining
plasma membrane. Nanocomplexes could be visualized as punctate green
signal, localized both in cytoplasm and nucleus. As expected, the
nanocomplex signal decreased gradually with time, corroborating the
data from q-PCR experiments (Figure S2).
In the case of HaCaT cells, overall nanocomplexes visualized were
less than those seen in B16-F10 cells, which could be because of the
lower uptake in the former.

State of the Nanocomplex Inside the Cells
We analyzed
the state of the different nanocomplexes in the cellular milieu by
detecting the amount of uncomplexed plasmid DNA present at different
time points (0–8 h) after the initial 4 h of incubation. We
chose Lipofectamine and M9 nanocomplexes for this study since these
appeared to be showing best retention across cell lines. We also included
M3 nanocomplexes to compare with M9 nanocomplexes and observe if terminal
cysteines in the peptide have any effect.

For estimating the
unbound plasmid amounts, cellular lysate of each sample was divided
in two halves, where DNase treatment was given to chop off unbound
plasmid DNA in one half and no treatment was given to the other (detailed
protocol mentioned in Materials and Methods). The difference between the measured values of untreated and DNase-treated
samples would give an estimate of unbound DNA present in each sample. Figure 4 shows that there
was a reduction in the estimated amount of plasmid DNA after DNase
treatment in almost all samples studied, indicating that there is
decomplexation in all of the cases over time. Apart from the CHO-K1
cell line, a gradual decrease in the percentage of bound plasmid DNA
was observed in B16-F10, HEK-293, and HaCaT cells for all nanocomplexes. Figure S3 depicts the bound DNA as a percentage
of total DNA (derived from the measurements shown in Figure 4). On normalization against
total DNA, it was observed that for M3 nanocomplexes, the plasmid
release at lower time points was comparatively higher, suggesting
that the nanocomplexes were more in uncomplexed state. In the case
of M9 and Lipofectamine, in most cases, at low time points of 0 and
2 h, more DNA was present in the complexed state than the uncomplexed
state. However, the uncomplexation appears to increase at 4 and 8
h time points.

factions:
(a) B16-F10, (b) CHOK-1, (c) HaCaT, and (d) HEK-293 cells were incubated
with different nanocomplexes for 4 h, followed by cell harvesting
and lysis at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. Cellular lysate of each sample was
divided in two halves and was either subjected to DNase or given no
treatment, prior to q-PCR estimation of plasmid DNA. The solid lines
represent the total DNA, while the corresponding dotted line represents
the DNA remaining after DNase treatment. Data are presented as mean ±
standard deviation of at least three independent experiments.

Lysosomal Colocalization of Nanocomplexes
In addition,
we also analyzed whether the localization of the nanocomplexes is
different in the different cases. Evolving lysosomal colocalization
of M3, M9, and Lipofectamine nanocomplexes with time was observed
at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h (Figure S4) in the
B16-F10 cell line. M3 nanocomplexes displayed the highest average
colocalization over time, followed by Lipofectamine and M9, as indicated
by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient in Supporting Information Table S2. Temporal changes in the lysosomal colocalization
of the nanocomplexes were found to be completely different for M3,
higher colocalization was observed at early hours, while for M9 and
Lipofectamine, colocalization increased with time. This indicates
that for M3, a larger fraction of the nanocomplexes becomes unavailable
for further downstream processing in early time points (0–2
h). In the case of M9 and Lipofectamine, colocalization remains similar
over time or drops slightly. M9 showed overall lower lysosomal colocalization
than Lipofectamine.

Nuclear colocalization of the M9 and Lipofectamine
nanocomplexes was studied using confocal live cell microscopy for
8 h in B16-F10 cells. Images were also captured at 0, 2, 4, and 8
h (Figure S5). For both nanocomplexes,
colocalization with nucleus was found to increase between 2 and 6
h, after which it stabilized. A higher nuclear colocalization was
observed in the case of Lipofectamine NC than M9 NC.

Transfection Efficiency of the Nanocomplexes
Luciferase
expression after 24 h in different cell lines was found to be differing
for different vector system and cell line (Figure 5). For all of the cell lines studied, HaCaT
showed the least transgene expression with all nanocomplexes, while
B16-F10 and HEK-293 showed highest expression levels. Lipofectamine
nanocomplexes exhibited the highest transfection efficiency in majority
of the cell lines, followed by M9- and PEI-based nanocomplexes, while
M3, M4, and M1 were lower in transfection efficiency in most of the
cases.

Figure 5 Cellular transfection of nanocomplexes was estimated at 24 h post
media by measuring luciferase gene expression. Data are presented
as mean ± standard deviation of at least three independent experiments.
(Few of the transfection efficiencies were reported earlier for M3,
M4, and M9. However, for the sake of comparison, and since experimental
conditions were not identical, we had to carry out fresh experiments
and plotted all data carried out under similar conditions together).

Discussion
In this work, we are trying to understand
the role of cellular
retention and exocytosis in controlling the gene delivery efficiency
of a number of peptide cationic vectors in comparison to two commercial
gene delivery agents. We observed that while the commercial agents
showed good transfection, only the cysteine-modified peptide showed
high transfection efficiency while the others were not efficient in
transfection. To check for the possible role of cellular retention
in governing transfection efficiency, we measured the retained and
exocytosed nanocomplexes in all of the cases. We devised an experimental
methodology in which cells were initially incubated with a nanocomplex
for 4 h, and then media was changed, followed by the q-PCR-based estimation
of plasmid DNA at different time points. Although this does not give
us the information whether the DNA is in a complexed state or existing
as free DNA, the total amount of DNA from the plasmid present inside
the cells and in the media can be estimated. Moreover, we used heparin
to release the DNA in all of the cases to avoid any measurement artifact
between DNA in compacted form and free/partially complexed DNA. It
also needs to be noted here that there is small loss during the process
of measurement because of which the sum of the total amount retained
in the cells and the total amount in the media fraction is always
slightly less than the total amount added initially. This is however
a small experimental artifact across all of the samples and is unlikely
to change the trends we observe. Also, small errors could arise in
the case of measurements of very low concentrations since regression
line obtained from standard curve (Ct value
vs concentration) was exponential. However, the overall trends are
largely not affected. Another possible anomaly can arise because of
the presence of some nanocomplexes on the cell surface itself, the
information from which might not get incorporated in the measurements.
To minimize any effects of this phenomenon, we have used multiple
washing steps with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove
the cell-surface-bound nanocomplexes.

We observed a drop in
the amount of DNA retained in the cells over
a period of time along with a concomitant increase in DNA in the media
in all of the cases. The pattern of cellular egress, however, varied
depending upon the nature of the carrier, as described in the Results section. The size of nanocomplexes showed
a clear bearing on the retention, with smaller-sized particles showing
more retention (M9, Lipofectamine, and PEI) and low retention in the
case of comparatively larger nanocomplexes (M1, M3, and M4). Biophysical
properties like nanoparticle size can be an important parameter that
controls cellular uptake.24 In this case,
even when the retention was normalized against the uptake, better
retention was seen in the case of smaller nanocomplexes. Normalized
retention trends showed fast recycling during initial hours (0–2
h) for M1, M3, and M4, suggesting a significant egress of these nanocomplexes.
Both highly positively charged nanocomplexes like those prepared with
M9 and highly negatively charged nanocomplexes like those with Lipofectamine
showed high retention. Overall, the nanocomplexes showing high retention
also showed high transfection efficiency.

The nature of the
carrier also appeared to play a role in the retention
and egress. Peptide M9 (which has two terminal cysteines added in
the M3 sequence) not only showed higher uptake in almost all of the
cell lines but also far slower recycling, as indicated by larger amounts
of DNA retained beyond 2 h in most cases. Thus, it appears that more
DNA is uptaken as well as retained in the cells in this case over
time. Cysteine modification of peptide has been reported to improve
not only stability of nanocomplexes34 but
also transfection efficiencies32,35 by facilitating disulfide
cross-linkages. While it is not clear how this could help in increased
retention, one of the contributing factors that could be important
is enhanced membrane-anchoring activity rendered by terminal cysteines.33,34 Since the peptide carrying the corresponding non-cysteine-modified
sequence (M3) did not show high retention, the mechanisms and kinetics
of cellular egress might be controlled by this subtle change in the
peptide sequence.

Another observation was that the trends were
observed to be mostly
similar in all of the cell lines and no drastic variation in retention
trends was seen. Multiple reports in the literature suggest higher
recycling of drugs and nanomedicine in cancer cells;36 thus, for our study, we chose three immortalized cell lines
of different tissue origin and one cancerous cell line (B16-F10).
However, although the uptakes varied from cell line to cell line,
our results on normalized cellular retention trends do not show much
difference between the two cell types, suggesting a higher dependence
on the type of vector used rather than the cell line. The available
literature also suggests that all of these nanocomplexes employ multiple
endocytotic pathways for nanocomplex uptake. The lack of the effect
of cell line on retention might indicate a higher importance of the
physicochemical nature of the nanocomplexes rather than the endocytotic
pathways of entry.

We additionally also looked at the state
of the retained nanocomplex
and its localization to check whether these factors additionally influence
transfection. Nanocomplex unpackaging to release transgene has been
described as one of the major hurdles in dictating the gene delivery
efficiency.37−39 However, early unpackaging makes the DNA prone to
cytoplasmic degradation, while low unpackaging or strong complexation
will result in less amounts being available for expression. In view
of this, late unpackaging of nanocomplexes preferably near nucleus
would be the ideal scenario for DNA delivery and subsequent expression
of transgene. As described earlier, for estimating this, nanocomplexes
were subjected to DNase treatment, followed by q-PCR-based measurement.
It may be noted that one possible source of error in such measurement
could be amplification through fragmented plasmid DNA. Even though
we confirmed that DNase treatment was able to completely degrade the
plasmid DNA through agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown),
this experimental limitation might have resulted in slightly lower
estimation of free DNA. However, this will be across all of the cases,
and therefore, the trends of the result would not be affected. We
observed a higher unpackaging in M3 nanocomplexes compared to M9 nanocomplexes.
This could be because the M3 nanocomplexes are comparatively less
packaged as seen by the higher size. This could also be attributed
to the absence of terminal cysteine modification in M3. Moreover,
more uncomplexed DNA was observed at earlier time point (Figure S3) in M3, while unpackaging for M9 was
delayed and was observed at higher time points, which might facilitate
gene delivery to nucleus and thus transgene expression. However, it
was intriguing to note that in the case of Lipofectamine, although
the nanocomplex size was large, the unpackaging was less. The nature
of peptide–DNA and lipid–DNA interactions for nanocomplex
formation might be different in the two cases and might be responsible
for this effect.

Lysosome-based recycling of nanocomplexes and
nanoparticles has
been identified as a significant metabolic pathway in the literature.40 Thus, nanocomplexes colocalizing with lysosomes
have higher chances of being recycled. A significantly higher lysosomal
colocalization of M3 NCs at 0 h (just after media change) indicates
that a large amount of the nanocomplexes are going to get recycled
through the lysosomal pathway or will undergo lysosomal degradation.
With time, lysosomal colocalization of M3 decreased; however, cellular
retention is poor at these time points and the retained DNA is largely
uncomplexed. Thus, even if the lysosomal degradation is avoided, the
uncomplexed DNA may not be suitably stable to reach the nucleus for
gene expression. Lipofectamine nanocomplexes exhibited a higher lysosomal
colocalization than M9 nanocomplexes; however, cellular retention
of Lipofectamine nanocomplexes was slightly higher than that of the
M9 nanocomplex, indicating that the fraction of DNA available for
downstream processing may not be significantly different between the
two. In both these cases, the DNA release from the nanocomplexes occurs
at higher time points, which might mean that the nanocomplexes which
avoided the recycling would be more stable for the cytoplasmic journey
and eventual nuclear entry. Since nuclear entry is an identified prerequisite
for successful gene delivery,41 we also
studied colocalization of M9 and Lipofectamine nanocomplexes with
nucleus. We observed a significant nuclear colocalization for both
M9 and Lipofectamine nanocomplexes, starting from 3 h post media change
(Figure S5). This further reiterates the
earlier observations. All of the nanocomplexes used for studying the
effect of retention were screened for toxicity using the MTT assay
and showed nonsignificant cellular killing (Figure S6).

Conclusions
The results suggest that cellular retention
and exocytosis are
important factors that can have an effect on transfection efficiencies
of peptide, lipid, and polymer-based vectors. In addition, subcellular
distribution/localization along with unpackaging dynamics of DNA can
further have an effect on the DNA retained in the cells. The chemical
nature of the carrier and size of the nanocomplexes are important
determinants of cellular retention, and the cell line used does not
appear to have any effect. High transfection efficiencies for Lipofectamine
and a cysteine-modified peptide M9 in comparison to other nanocomplexes
can be rationalized as a combinatorial effect of high uptake, enhanced
retention, lower unpackaging, and poor colocalization with lysosomes
at an early stage after entering the cells. Further, the role of terminal
cysteine modification stands out in enhancing the retention. Further
work may involve modification of the nanocomplexes through different
moieties/signal sequences to alter the retention and trafficking of
these moieties and thereby used as a strategy to enhance the transfection
efficiency.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, Reagents, and Kits
All of the peptides were
custom-synthesized with >95% purity grade from G.L. Biochem (Shanghai)
Ltd. The plasmid used for this study, pMIR-REPORT Luciferase (pDNA),
was maintained in E. coli DH5α
cells and purified using GenElute HP Endotoxin-Free Plasmid MaxiPrep
Kit (Sigma). Polyethyleneimine (PEI, MW ∼ 25 kDa, branched)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lipofectamine 2000, heparin salt
was purchased from Invitrogen. Primers for q-PCR were designed using
Primer3 Input version 0.4.0 and synthesized through (Integrated DNA
Technologies) IDT (Supporting Information Table S1). Fluorescein DNA labeling kits were purchased from Mirus
Bio Corporation. Cell viability assay kit CellTiter Glow was obtained
from Promega, and 35 mm glass-bottom imaging dishes for confocal microscopy
were purchased from ibidi cells in focus. KAPA SYBR fast 5× was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) culture medium, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), calf
fetal serum, and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics mixture were
purchased from Invitrogen.

Nanocomplex Formation
Nanocomplexes were formed with
different cationic agents and plasmid DNA. The charge ratio or ratio
of the amount of cationic agent to DNA was chosen in such a way as
to ensure complete condensation in all of the cases. The cationic
agents used are listed in Table 1. Peptide–DNA nanocomplexes were prepared at
a charge ratio Z (±) of 5 (charge ratio = total
positive charge of peptide/total negative charge of DNA). This charge
ratio was chosen since we have earlier observed a complete complexation
of plasmid DNA with these peptides under this condition.33 For this, plasmid DNA dilutions of 40 ng/μL
were added dropwise to equal volumes of appropriate peptide dilution
while vortexing at a steady speed. Lipofectamine nanocomplexes were
prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For preparation
of PEI nanocomplexes, a 10 mM solution of branched PEI (25 kDa) was
added dropwise to 40 ng/μL DNA dilution.18 The complexes so formed were incubated for 30–45
min at room temperature before performing any experiment.

Characterization of Nanocomplexes
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
The size of the nanocomplexes
and their surface charge (ζ-potential) were measured using Zetasizer
ZS90 (Malvern Instrument, U.K.) at a fixed angle of 90°. Nanocomplexes
were prepared with 40 ng/μL plasmid DNA at a charge ratio Z (±) of 5. Data were represented as mean ± standard
deviation. The sizes and charge of the nanocomplexes are listed in Table 1.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
To observe the morphology
of the nanocomplexes, 10 μL of different samples were prepared
at a charge ratio of 5 (as mentioned in the previous section) and
deposited on mica followed by drying. The imaging was performed using
a 5500 Scanning Probe Microscope (Agilent Technologies, Inc., AZ)
using Picoview software 1.4.4. Images were taken in the AAC mode in
air with silicon cantilever at 75 kHz of resonance frequency and 2.8
N/m constant force. The scanning speed was set at 1 line/s. Picoview
software was used for minimum image processing and analysis.

Cell Culture
HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cells)
and CHO-K1 (epithelial cells from Chinese hamster ovary) cells lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). B16-F10
(mouse melanoma) and HaCaT (human keratinocytes) cell lines were a
kind gift from Dr T.N. Vivek (CSIR-IGIB). The HEK-293 cells were maintained
in high-glucose DMEM; CHO-K1 in Hem’s F-12K; and B16-F10 and
HaCaT cells were maintained in DMEM-F12 media, supplemented with heat-inactivated
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Before proceeding for
any treatment, all cells were allowed to reach a confluency level
of 70–80%. The cell lines were selected to cover wide tissue
origin and included both cancerous and noncancerous cell line, and
the rate of exocytosis is found to be higher in cancerous cell lines.36

Cellular Uptake Assay
Cells were seeded in a 24-well
plate at different densities (55 000 cells/well for B16-F10,
75 000/well for HaCaT, 50 000/well for CHO-K1 and HEK-293)
1 day prior to treatment with nanocomplexes. Nanocomplexes were formed
using pMIR plasmid DNA nanocomplexes containing 2 μg of DNA
added to each well in Opti-MEM. After 4 h, the leftover media was
harvested from the cells and stored at −20 °C before setting
up q-PCR reactions. For estimating the amount of plasmid DNA present
in the leftover fraction, 2 μL of diluted media fraction samples
were used for setting up 15 μL of q-PCR reactions. The uptaken
amounts of plasmid DNA were estimated by subtracting the measured
amounts from 2 μg (initial DNA amount). In the uptake experiment,
multiple washing steps with 1× PBS was carried out so as to minimize
the amount of nanocomplex attached to the cell surface.

q-PCR-Based Cellular Retention Study
Cells were seeded
at different densities (55 000 cells/well for B16-F10, 75 000/well
for HaCaT, 50 000/well for CHO-K1 and HEK-293) in a 24-well
plate 1 day prior to treatment. Once subconfluency was achieved, the
cells were treated with nanocomplexes containing 2 μg of plasmid
DNA per well in 550 μL of reduced serum medium (Gibco Opti-MEM)
for 4 h. After 4 h, the leftover media was collected and labeled as
leftover fraction. The cells were washed with DPBS twice and 550 μL
of respective complete media was added to each well. From this time
onward, sampling was done at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h for both cellular fraction
and media fraction. For harvesting the cellular fraction, the cells
were washed twice with 1× DPBS and then trypsinized using 150
μL of trypsin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5000 rpm for 5 min and then finally suspended in 500 μL of MQ
for lysis. All of the cellular and media fractions were stored at
−20 °C, and q-PCR was carried out subsequently for estimating
the amount of plasmid DNA in different samples (cellular and media
fractions in all of the samples). Prior to setting up q-PCR reactions,
all of the samples were appropriately diluted and subjected to 9 mM
heparin challenge for uncomplexing the bound plasmid DNA. Primers
were designed against the backbone of pMIR-REPORT Luciferase plasmid
with amplicon size of ∼110 nm. The primers are listed in Supporting
Information Table S1. Designed PCR primers
were checked for nonspecificity by NCBI blast tool; 15 μL PCR
reactions were set up in Roche 384-well white plates (7.5 μL
of SYBR mix, 1.5 μL of primer mix, 4 μL of nuclease free
water, and 2 μL of samples). With each q-PCR assay, reactions
were setup to obtain a standard curve for the Ct value versus known plasmid dilution. The amount of plasmid
DNA was estimated for each sample by using linear equation of standard
curve and the obtained Ct value. To minimize
the effect of cellular lysate on q-PCR-based amplification, optimization
for cellular fraction dilution was performed. A 100× dilution
of cellular fraction was first prepared, and then, 2 μL of this
was used for setting up q-PCR reaction. Further, the standard curves
for cellular fraction were prepared by spiking plasmid DNA in similarly
diluted cell lysate to take care of any effect of cell lysate.

Assay for Uncomplexation of Plasmid DNA
After cellular
uptake, the amount of uncomplexed DNA present inside the cell at different
time points was estimated using a q-PCR-based strategy in all of the
cell lines. The cells were treated with nanocomplexes for 4 h followed
by media change, as described above. After media replacement, cellular
fractions were harvested at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h and lysed in Milli-Q
water. Each lysed cellular fraction was divided into two aliquots
of 200 μL each. One of the aliquots of each sample was treated
with 20 μL of 1 mg/mL DNase solution for 15 min at room temperature,
while the other aliquot remained untreated. Post DNase treatment,
both aliquots of each sample were subjected to 9 mM of Heparin challenge
for 30 min. The samples were then diluted 100×, and 2 μL
solutions were used for setting up q-PCR reaction to estimate the
complexed and uncomplexed DNA present in each sample.

Cellular Retention and Subcellular Localization of Nanocomplexes
Using Confocal Imaging
Cells were grown on a coverslip in
a six-well plate by seeding B16-F10 cells at a density of 80 000
cells/well and incubating for 24 h. FITC-labeled pMIR plasmid was
used for preparing nanocomplexes at a Z (±)
of 5 and added to the cells (2 μg pDNA per well) in 500 μL
of Opti-MEM. DNA labeling was performed using label IT tracker FITC
kit (Mirus Bio LLC), according to manufacturer’s instruction.
After 4 h of incubation, the treatment media was replaced by complete
media and cells were again incubated. At time points of 0, 2, 4, and
8 h after this, respective coverslips were treated with 1000×
Cell Mask Orange and 330 ng/μL of Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen)
followed by 30 min incubation and then washing. The cells were fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and mounted on slides using DPX
mountant (Sigma).

For studying colocalization of nanocomplexes
with lysosomes, 106 B16-F10 cells were seeded in ibidi
glass-bottom (35 mm) dishes 24 h prior to treatment. The cells were
incubated for 4 h in Opti-MEM with nanocomplexes (prepared using FITC-labeled
pMIR at a Z (±) of 5). After 4 h of incubation,
the treatment media was replaced with complete media after washing
the cells with 1× PBS. Lysosomal staining was performed by incubating
the cells with Lysotracker RED for 1 h prior to imaging. The cells
were washed with 0.04% trypan blue solution in 1× PBS, followed
by washing with 1× PBS. Finally, 1000 μL of Opti-MEM was
added to the dishes and live cell imaging was performed in a Leica
SP8 confocal microscope. Analysis of lysosomal colocalization with
nanocomplexes was performed using Volocity software, for which 50
cells were selected from three different fields and Pearson’s
correlation coefficients were estimated. Average Pearson’s
coefficient values from two independent sets of experiments were calculated
with standard deviation.

Nuclear colocalization of nanocomplexes
was studied by live cell
continuous microscopy over a period of 8 h after media change. For
this, B16-F10 cells were seeded in ibidi microchambered slides, at
a density of 20 000 cells per well 24 h prior to treatment.
The cells were treated with FITC-labeled nanocomplexes in Opti-MEM
for 4 h, followed by media change. Hoechst staining of cells was performed
by incubating with 1000× diluted working solution of Hoechst
(5 mg/mL) in 1× PBS for 10 min. The same cells were continuously
imaged in a CO2-maintained chamber for 8 h.

Transfection Efficiency through Luciferase Expression
For measurement of transfection in all of the cell lines involved
in this study, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day prior
to treatment (when cellular confluency reached ∼70%). Nanocomplexes
were prepared fresh at a Z (±) of 5 and added
to cells after 1 h incubation at room temperature, and 100 μL
of nanocomplex was added to each well in Opti-MEM (serum-free media).
After 4 h of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and
5% CO2, media was discarded and cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by addition of 500
μL of complete media for respective cell type. For measurement
of luciferase expression, the cells were washed with PBS after 24
h and lysed using 100 μL of 1× cell culture lysis buffer
(Promega). The measurement of expression in 50 μL of lysate
using luciferase assay substrate (Promega) was taken as light emission
by integration over 10 s in Orion microplate luminometer (Berthold
Detection System, Germany). Luciferase activity was normalized with
respect to the total protein content of the cell (measured using BCA).

Cellular Viability Assay
Cellular toxicity of all of
the nanocomplexes used in this study was assessed after 24 h of treatment
using the MTT assay. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate
1 day prior to incubation with nanocomplexes. At subconfluency, the
cells were incubated with 30 μL of different nanocomplexes for
4 h in serum-free media, after which the media was aspirated and cells
were washed with 1× PBS and then supplemented with 100 μL
complete media. After 24 h, the cells were incubated for another 2
h after adding the MTT reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) in each well. The media was then aspirated and
100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added followed by absorbance
recording.
