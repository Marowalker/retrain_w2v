SMYD3,
a SET and MYND domain containing lysine methyltransferase,
catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from a methyl donor onto
the Nε group of a lysine residue in the substrate protein. Methylation
of MAP3 kinase kinase (MAP3K2) by SMYD3 has been implicated in Ras-driven
tumorigenesis. The crystal structure of SMYD3 in complex with MAP3K2
peptide reveals a shallow hydrophobic pocket (P-2), which accommodates
the binding of a phenylalanine residue at the −2 position of
the substrate (F258) is a crucial determinant of substrate specificity
of SMYD3. To better understand the substrate preference of SMYD3 at
the −2 position, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the
MM/GBSA method were performed on the crystal structure of SMYD3-MAP3K2
complex (PDB: 5EX0) after substitution of F258 residue of MAP3K2 to each of the other
19 natural residues, respectively. Binding free energy calculations
reveal that the P-2 pocket prefers an aromatic hydrophobic group and
none of the substitutions behave better than the wild-type phenylalanine
residue does. Furthermore, we investigated the structure–activity
relationships (SAR) of a series of non-natural phenylalanine derivative
substitutions at the −2 position and found that quite a few
modifications on the sidechain of F258 residue could strengthen its
binding to the P-2 pocket of SMYD3. These explorations provide insights
into developing novel SMYD3 inhibitors with high potency and high
selectivity against MAP3K2 and cancer.

1 Introduction
The
lysine methylation is a principal regulatory mechanism that
influences the protein activity, stability, and function.1 SMYDs (SET and MYND domain containing proteins)
catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) onto the Nε group of a lysine residue
in the target protein substrate. Both histones and nonhistone proteins
have been shown to be the substrates of SMYD family proteins. Their
reported histone targets include H3K4 (SMYD1 and SMYD3), H3K36 (SMYD2),
and H4K5 (SMYD3),2−5 functioning in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression.6−11 Nonhistone substrates can also be methylated by SMYD proteins (Figure 1A). SMYD2 has a broad
spectrum of substrates including tumor suppressor protein p53 (K370),12 retinoblastoma (Rb, K860),13 estrogen receptor α (ERα, K266),14 heat shock protein 90 (HSP90, K615),15 and period circadian protein homolog 2 (PER2,
K798).16 In the case of SMYD3, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1, K831) and MAP3 kinase
kinase (MAP3K2, K260) have been reported to be the substrates of SMYD3.17,18

SMYD3 has been implicated in a variety of cancers
including liver,
colon, and breast cancer related to its methyltransferase activity
on nonhistone targets.19−22 Methylation of VEGFR1 K831 by SMYD3 enhances its autophosphorylation
and kinase activity in the cell and promotes carcinogenesis.23−25 Methylation of MAP3K2 at K260 in the cytoplasm activates the MAP
kinase signaling module and promotes RAS-driven tumorigenesis.18,26 These results suggest that targeting the methyltransferase activity
of SMYD3 would be a useful strategy in anticancer therapy.

Our
previous work solved the crystal structure of SMYD3 in complex
with MAP3K2 peptide.27 The structure reveals
that there is an amphiphilic cleft for substrate binding on the surface
of SMYD3. A shallow hydrophobic pocket (P-2), which accommodates the
binding of a phenylalanine residue at the −2 position of the
substrate (F258) is a crucial determinant of the substrate specificity
of SMYD3 (Figure 1B).
This P-2 pocket is composed of several hydrophobic residues including
L104, V178, I179, and V195, with two serine residues, S101 and S182,
standing at the perimeters of the pocket (Figure 1C). SMYD2 contains a similar shallow hydrophobic
pocket to hold the leucine residue at −1 position of the substrate
p53, with L108, V179, N180, S196, T105, and G183 taking the place
of L104, V179, I179, V195, S101, and S182 of SMYD3, respectively (PDB
IDs: 3TG5 and 5EX0, Figure 1C). It is interesting to find
that a majority of the reported substrates of SMYD2 include a leucine
residue at the −1 position12−16 (Figure 1A). And the importance of this hydrophobic pocket in substrate
binding preference of SMYD2 has been proved by several experimental
and computational studies.16,28−32

In the past decade, several computational protein design protocols
have been reported to predict the specificity of protein–protein
or protein–ligand interactions.33−36 Coupled protein docking and conformational
ensemble methods37−39 were further developed to enhance the accuracy of
prediction. For example, a multistate computational procedure combining
backbone ensemble, energy minimization, amino acid substitution, and
fitness calculation was developed to probe the substrate specificity
of SMYD2.32 The result reveals that SMYD2
exhibits narrow specificity for substrates at the −1 and +2
positions. Besides these approaches, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
are valuable adjuncts to reveal substrate recognitions by conformational
dynamics. The motions of substrate and protein induced by their mutual
interactions could be directly observed through trajectories.40−42

To better understand the substrate preference of SMYD3 at
the −2
position, different kinds of natural amino acid substitutions are
first used as probes to explore the binding preference of the P-2
pocket in this work. Binding free energy calculations of MD simulations
from the MM/GBSA method reveal that the P-2 pocket plays a crucial
role in substrate binding with narrow specificity. It prefers an aromatic
hydrophobic group and none of the substitutions behave better than
the wild-type phenylalanine does. Furthermore, a series of non-natural
phenylalanine derivative substitutions at the −2 position was
investigated by similar MD simulations procedures. Results show that
quite a few modifications on the sidechain of F258 residue could further
stabilize the sidechain conformation, and thus strengthen its binding
to the P-2 pocket of SMYD3. These results provide insights into developing
novel SMYD3 inhibitors with high potency and high selectivity against
MAP3K2 and cancer.

2 Results and Discussion
First, we performed a 100-ns MD simulation to observe the stability
of SMYD3-MAP3K2 complex. SMYD3 is composed of three domains, an N-terminal
catalytic domain (SET and post-SET), a MYND domain inserts into the
SET domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Figure 1B). The crystal structure of SMYD3-MAP3K2
complex reveals that the SET and post-SET domains of SMYD3 contribute
most of the binding force to substrate binding other than the MYND
and CTD domains. root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) analyses of
each residue of the complex after 100-ns MD simulation show that the
MYND and CTD domains of SMYD3 are more flexible than the SET and post-SET
domains (Figure 2A).
In the case of MAP3K2 peptide, residues from −2 to +2 positions
(F258 to G262) are more stable than the remaining N- and C-terminal
residues (Figure 2B). Figure 2C exhibits time evolutions
of root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the stable regions of SMYD3
and MAP3K2. The RMSD values of both SET and post-SET domains of SMYD3
and F258 to G262 residues of MAP3K2 reach a stable plateau after ∼10
ns of simulations and keep a position around an average value of 2.3
and 1.0 Å during the remaining MD simulations, respectively.
These results indicate that a 50-ns MD simulation unit performed on
the stable regions of SMYD3 and MAP3K2 in the following study is sufficient
for detecting reliable binding free energies and conformational dynamics
of the complex.

2.1 Conformational Dynamics of F258 and Substitutions
at the −2 Position
Binding preference at the −2
position was detected by the conformational dynamics of the F258 residue
and each of its substitutions. A 50-ns MD simulation was performed
three times. Averaged binding free energy of SMYD3 to F258 residue
or its substitution from the last 2-ns was calculated, as shown in Figure 3A and Table 1, and time evolutions of its
binding free energy in each repetition is depicted in Figure S1. The binding free energy tends to convergence,
which means the complex has reached a relatively stable state during
MD simulations. The results show that wild-type F258 of MAP3K2 has
a most negative binding free energy of −9.64 kcal/mol toward
SMYD3, indicating the most favorable substrate–protein recognition.
Replacement of F258 to a leucine or a methionine residue results in
an increased binding free energy of −5.46 and −5.31
kcal/mol, respectively. Other hydrophobic residue substitutions like
I, V, C, and Y show tolerable but much weaker binding energy toward
SMYD3. F258Y introduces an additional hydroxyl group to the phenyl
ring, which lowers its binding affinity to the P-2 hydrophobic pocket.
While in the case of the remaining F258 substitutions, the calculated
binding free energy may be too high for efficient recognition. These
results are in consistence with our previous experimental data27 and similar to the substrate specificity of
SMYD2 at −1 position proved by computational and experimental
approaches.41

Besides binding
free energies, binding modes at the P-2 pocket
could be traced after MD simulations. The initial conformation of
F258 in the crystal structure is shown in the left panel of Figure 3B. Distances of sidechain-centroids
between F258 and each of the six residues forming the P-2 pocket of
SMYD3 (numbered 1–6) are shown in a graduated color map at
the right panel, from blue (closest) to red (farthest). Moreover,
the averaged distance in the color map would help to estimate the
occupancy rate of F258 in the P-2 pocket. Average conformations of
F258 and its 19 replacements in the P-2 pocket during the last 2-ns
MD simulations are shown in Figures 3C–H and S2. From
the results, we can see that the conformation of F258 is rather stable,
and its averaged distance to the P-2 pocket residues changed from
6.37 Å to a little bit more favorable 6.24 Å after simulations
(Figure 3C). Among
the 19 substitutions of F258, only leucine and methionine residues
insert into and fully occupy the P-2 pocket like the phenylalanine
residue does, with a slightly larger distances of 6.57 and 6.92 Å,
respectively (Figure 3D,E). In the case of other hydrophobic substitutions like I, V, C,
A, and W, their sidechains are not symmetrically presented (I), too
short (V, C, A), or too large (W) to fully insert into the P-2 pocket
(Figures 3F,G and S2). Other residues with hydrophilic or charged
sidechains like arginine could not be stably located inside the pocket
and the unfavorable bindings lead to their sidechains flipping out
of the pocket during MD simulations (Figures 3H and S2).

The P-2 pocket of SMYD3 is a shallow hydrophobic pit mainly formed
by L104, V178, I179, and V195; its binding preference is associated
with the hydrophobic property and the sidechain volume of the interacting
residue. From our calculation results, −2 position residue
with aromatic hydrophobic sidechain shows a much negative binding
free energy to the P-2 pocket than residues with small or hydrophilic
sidechains. Meanwhile, nonpolar sidechains occupy the −2 pocket
better and demonstrate a much favorable binding mode than polar or
charged ones. These are consistent with the size and hydrophobic property
of the P-2 pocket.

Our previous work showed that the catalytic
activity of SMYD3 toward
MAP3K2 peptide decreased ∼6-fold when F258 was mutated to a
leucine residue, and no methylation activity was detected when an
F258R mutation was introduced to the substrate.27 Combined with binding free energy calculations and structural
analyses, this work provides good explanations of the experimental
results. Compared with the wild-type phenylalanine residue, a leucine
residue has a 4.2 kcal/mol higher binding free energy to the P-2 pocket,
indicating a lower binding capacity (−5.46 to −9.64
kcal/mol). MD simulations demonstrate that a leucine residue can occupy
the P-2 pocket well but has a lower occupancy rate than phenylalanine
(6.57–6.24 Å). These may be the major reasons causing
a lower activity of SMYD3 on F258L mutant of the substrate. This can
be further proved by the substitution of the −2 residue of
VEGFR1, another reported substrate of SMYD3. VEGFR1 happens to contain
a leucine residue at the −2 position (L829, Figure 1A), and the activity of SMYD3
on VEGFR1 is lower than that on MAP3K2.27 When L829 is substituted by a phenylalanine residue, the binding
free energy of F829 to the P-2 pocket decreases from −4.49
to −8.52 kcal/mol (Table S1), which
confirms the importance of −2 phenylalanine to the activity
of SMYD3.

To further prove that the binding affinity is related
to the catalytic
activity directly, in other words, is not affected by the change of
the catalytic property of SMYD3 when catalyzing on mutated substrates,
we first measured Kcat value of SMYD3
on wild-type MAP3K2 peptide and F258L mutant by in vitro methyltransferase
assay. Results show similar Kcat values
of SMYD3 on wild-type MAP3K2 (5.51 ± 0.85 h–1) compared with that on F258L mutant (5.13 ± 0.58 h–1), indicating a constant catalytic property of SMYD3 (Table S2). In addition, we demonstrate computationally
that the active site structures remain the same for different mutants
during MD simulations by calculating the averaged RMSD value of the
key residues both in the active site and in the P-2 pocket of SMYD3
(Table S3). Results show small RMSDs (from
0.58 to 1.21 Å) with reasonable standard deviations (0.08–0.36
Å), indicating that the structures of the active site of SMYD3
remain the same for all of the 19 mutated substrates during MD simulations.

In the case of F258R mutation, the positively charged large sidechain
of an arginine residue can hardly fit into the P-2 pocket after the
MD simulations, and binding free energies rose to an even positive
charged value with big deviations among paralleled simulations (Table 1). The failure of
recognition at the −2 position may disturb substrate binding,
hindering the insertion of the target lysine residue into the catalytic
pocket. The improper distance or uncomfortable circumstance between
the Nε group of lysine and the methyl group on SAM will prevent
an efficient transfer of the methyl group.

2.2 SARs
of Phenylalanine Derivatives at the −2
Position
Our research reveals that the P-2 pocket has a high
binding preference for phenylalanine residue. The structure–activity
relationship (SAR) studies of modifications on the −2 phenylalanine
would be important for future inhibitor design targeting the P-2 pocket.
For this propose, a series of substitutions of −2 residue by
non-natural phenylalanine derivatives was investigated by similar
MD simulation procedures. A total of 51 phenylalanine derivatives
or mimics was chosen from the SwissSidechain database,43 which provides a unified web resource for hundreds
of non-natural sidechains with biochemical parameters. Time evolutions
of binding free energy (Figure S3) show
that each complex has reached a relatively stable state during MD
simulations. Binding free energy calculations show that quite a few
modifications on the phenyl ring and two cycloalkyl mimics have more
negative values than phenylalanine, indicating a more favorable binding
to the P-2 pocket (Figure 4A, Table S4).

(B–P) The conformations of the representative F258 modifications.
The residue labels of SMYD3 are shown in (B) and omitted in the other
figures for brevity. Hydrogen bond is depicted as dash line if it
exists.

Among these beneficial modifications,
halogen substitutions prove
to be good candidates. And the less hydrophilic substitution results
in a more favorable recognition as exampled by monosubstitution at
the para position of the phenyl ring by different halogens. Binding
free energy results show that substitutions by I (PHI, −10.53
kcal/mol), Br (4BF, −10.49 kcal/mol), and Cl (F20, −10.04
kcal/mol) are more suitable to the pocket than wild-type F258 (−9.64
kcal/mol), but F (PFF, −9.51 kcal/mol) is not a good candidate
of substitution (Table 2, Figure 4B–E).
These results correspond with the hydrophobic property of the P-2
pocket. Electronegativity of iodine is very close to that of carbon,
and thus C–I bond is less polarized than other carbon–halogen
bonds, which makes iodine substitution the most favorable. On the
contrary, the electronegativity of fluorine is much higher than that
of carbon, so the C–F bond is strongly polarized, which results
in the unfavorable binding of fluorine substitution. Furthermore,
monosubstitution by halogen at the para position of the phenyl ring
seems to be more effective than that at the ortho or meta position
(Table 2), which may
due to the spatial locations of residues forming the P-2 pocket. As
shown in Figure 3B,
the distance between −2-position F258 and L104 residue of SMYD3
leaves adequate space to allow suitable modifications at the para
position on the phenyl ring. In contrast, the sidechain hydroxyl group
of S182 at the periphery of the P-2 pocket is rather close (∼4
Å) to the ortho and meta sites on one side of the phenyl ring,
and thus it may hinder further modifications at those positions, especially
for big hydrophobic halogen atoms. However, monosubstitution by the
hydroxyl group at the ortho position is better than that at the meta
or para position for recognition because its hydrophilic property
is more suitable for interacting with S182 residue (Table 2). Double substitutions by halogens
(except fluorine) at both para and meta sites result in a more favorable
binding to the P-2 pocket as both of the halogen atoms insert into
the pocket in good conformations (I34, B34, and CP3 in Table 3, Figure 4F–H). However, the para–ortho-site
double modifications (CP2) is not as good as the para–meta
one (CP3) because of the rather outer position and more hydrophilic
property of the ortho site compared to the meta site in the pocket,
though it is still better than a monosubstitution at the para site
(F20) (Table 3, Figure 4I).

Substitution by
the methyl group seems to be an alternative strategy
that the mono-meta site (APD, −9.88 kcal/mol), mono-para site
(4PH, −10.17 kcal/mol), and double-meta–para-site substitution
(MP3, −9.80 kcal/mol) show a slightly lower binding free energy
than F258 (−9.64 kcal/mol), respectively. A mono-ortho-site
methyl modification is not as good as the para or meta substitution
somehow (MPH, −9.45 kcal/mol) because the CH3 group
at the ortho position may have space clashes with the aforementioned
S182 residue of the P-2 pocket (Figures 4J and S4). Larger
methyl group derivatives like the C(CH3)3 group
behaves better than the methyl group at the para position (−10.46
to −10.17 kcal/mol) because of its greater hydrophobic property
(Table S4, Figure 4K).

As one can predict, none of the
hydroxyl group substitutions are
suitable for the P-2 pocket, though the ortho substitution seems to
be better than meta or para ones (Table 2). However, triple substitution by the hydroxyl
group and halogen seems to be a good option as exampled by hydroxyl
and halogen combinations. Substitutions by two iodine or bromine atoms
and one hydroxyl group exhibit good binding free energies to the P-2
pocket and in the meantime attenuate the strong hydrophobic property
introduced by the two halogen atoms (Table 3). Among these, BOH and BO2 with para-, meta-double
bromine and ortho-hydroxyl group substitutions show pretty good binding
free energy to the P-2 pocket as two bromine atoms insert into the
pocket in good conformations, though BOH with a hydroxyl group positioned
in the same side of the phenyl ring to bromine atoms behaves better
than the opposite-side BO2 does (Figure 4L,M). If the hydroxyl group is positioned
at the meta (BMO) or para (DBY) position, the binding free energy
is higher and the hydrogen bond is formed with D100 instead of S182
residue, requiring a big conformational change in D100 (Table 3, Figures 4N and S4). Iodine
may not be a good choice in these mixed triple substitutions because
of its big size, though the binding free energy is rather outstanding
(Table S4 and Figure S4). These findings
throw light on future inhibitor designs by using substrate mimics
at the −2 position, since the solubility of the small inhibitor
can be increased by introducing a hydrophilic group but not at the
expense of losing too much binding affinity.

Furthermore, substitutions
of the whole phenyl ring by cycloalkyl
mimics also show rather good results. This may be connected with the
flexibility of naphthene that it could fit into the P-2 pocket better
than a more rigid phenyl ring. Cyclohexyl ring is better than the
cyclopentyl ring as it resembles the phenyl ring more in shape (Table 3, Figure 4O,P).

3 Conclusions
In this work, we use MD simulations and the
MM/GBSA method to study
the substrate preference of methyltransferase SMYD3. The P-2 pocket
of SMYD3 is a well-defined shallow hydrophobic subpocket adjacent
to the catalytic pocket. The −2-position F258 residue of MAP3K2
was substituted to each of the other 19 natural residues followed
by a 50-ns MD simulation repeated three times, respectively. The energetic
and structural results show that the P-2 pocket prefers an average-sized
hydrophobic group. None of the substitutions behave better than the
wild-type phenylalanine residue.

As the P-2 pocket plays a significant
role in substrate binding,
we investigated the SARs of a series of non-natural phenylalanine
derivative substitutions at the −2 position. Results show that
the P-2 pocket has adequate space to allow hydrophobic modifications
at the para positions on the phenyl ring, especially for halogen atoms
like bromine and chlorine. However, the hydrophilic S182 residue in
the P-2 pocket confines the size and hydrophobicity of the substitution
at the ortho or meta position of the ring. Multiple substitutions
by hydroxyl group and halogen combinations seem to be a good guidance
for future inhibitor design to achieve both solubility and affinity.

Recently, EPZ030456 was developed as an SMYD3 inhibitor with a
nanomolar inhibition concentration.44 However,
the crystal structure shows that except for the headgroup that inserts
into the lysine channel, the compound makes few specific interactions
with SMYD3. To our knowledge, the P-2 pocket has not been shown as
a target pocket in developing SMYD3 inhibitors. Investigations of
binding preference of the P-2 pocket, as well as the SARs of modifications
on the −2-position phenyl ring in this study, will provide
insights into the rational drug design to develop novel SMYD3 inhibitors
with high potency and selectivity.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Systems for MD Simulations
The previously
solved crystal structure of SMYD3 and MAP3K2 complex (PDB: 5EX0) was used as the
starting structure. F258 and G262 at the −2 and +2 positions
of the MAP3K2 peptide were substituted to each of the other 19 natural
residues, respectively. F258 was also substituted, respectively, to
several non-natural residues chosen from the SwissSidechain database,43 which provides a unified web resource for hundreds
of non-natural sidechains with biochemical parameters. The selection
of non-natural residue types follows the rules: (1) Sidechains were
mainly chosen from the set of phenylalanine derivatives. (2) Sidechains
with large substituted groups on the phenyl ring such as phenyl group,
phosphate group, nitro group, cyan group, and guanidine group were
not considered in case of steric conflicts with the P-2 pocket. (3)
Sidechains with modifications on the CB atom such as hydroxyl- or
carbonyl substitutions were not considered to simplify the system
of comparison. (4) There is no special requirement for the position
(ortho, meta, or para) or the number (mono or multi) of the substituted
group. (5) Two alanine derivatives were selected with cycloalkyl sidechains
to resemble the phenyl ring. Names of these non-natural residues were
shown by three-letter abbreviations. (6) Eleven phenylalanine derivatives
with halogen-substitutions, which are not included in the database,
were also employed in the SARs study. They are I34, B34, BOH, IMO,
IO2, BO2, BMO, MIF, MBF, OIF, and OBF. Their structures were modified
from 4-bromo-phenylalanine (4BF) in the database by changing the substituted
groups manually. Finally, 51 non-natural sidechains were investigated
in MD simulations.

4.2 Parameters in the MD Simulations
The LEaP module of the AMBER18 package45 was used for residue substitution and adding hydrogen atoms for
each complex. The cofactor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine
(SAH) and three zinc ions in the crystal structure were reserved in
the MD simulations. The chelating cysteine and histidine residues
were deprotonated. The amber FF14SB force field46 was used for protein and natural residues. The force field
parameters of non-natural residues and SAH were derived from the SwissSidechain
database43 and the general Amber force
field (GAFF),47 respectively. TIP3P water
model48 was used to solvate the complex
in a hexagonal explicit water box under the periodic boundary condition.
The distance between the edges of the box and the closet atoms of
the complex was 12 Å. Na+ was added as a counterion
to neutralize each system.

For each solvated system, 5000-step
energy minimization was performed, followed by a combined equilibration
process with a 500-ps constant volume ensemble to heat the system
from 0 to 300 K and a 500-ps constant pressure ensemble at a constant
pressure of 1 bar. The Langevin thermostat49 and Berendsen barostat50 were used for
temperature and pressure control, respectively. During equilibration,
a force constant of 10 kcal mol–1 Å–2 as a harmonic constraint was applied. Then, 50-ns MD simulation
of each system was performed in constant pressure ensembles at 300
K with the constraint released. The time step was set to 2 fs. The
SHAKE algorithm51 was used to restrain
all of the bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms. The particle mesh
Ewald (PME) method52 was used to calculate
the long-range electrostatic contributions. The cut-off value of the
van der Waals interactions was set to 10 Å. Each system was performed
three times under the same conditions to confirm the results. Besides,
an extra 100-ns MD simulation of SMYD3 in complex with wild-type MAP3K2
peptide was performed to investigate their stability. The AMBER18
software package45 was employed to perform
MD simulations. Coordinates were saved every 10 ps.

4.3 Analysis of the Simulations
The interactions
between SMYD3 and the focused residues were calculated by the MM/GBSA
method, which combines molecular mechanics (MM), the Generalized Born
(GB) equations, and surface accessible (SA) calculations to calculate
the binding free energy.53−55 The calculated binding free energy
is given by 1  where ΔGbind, vac is the free energy of the complex
in the gas phase, including nonbonded
and bonded potentials calculated by the MM method, and ΔGcom, sol, ΔGrec, sol, and ΔGlig, sol are the free energies of the complex, receptor, and ligand in the
aqueous phase, respectively. The solvated free energies include the
polar and nonpolar free energies, which are computed by the GB and
SA methods, respectively. In this work, the binding free energy between
SMYD3 and the residue in the peptide substrate was calculated by a
total of 200 snapshots extracted from the final 2 ns trajectory of
each system. All of the parameters were set as default values in the
calculations. In each system, the residue in the MAP3K2 peptide to
be calculated and the whole protein with SAH and zinc ions were considered
as ligand and receptor, respectively. Since we are mainly interested
in the differences of the binding free energies, entropy was ignored
in the calculations.

The cpptraj module56 of AmberTools18 was used to calculate the averaged structure, the
averaged distance, root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), and root
mean square deviations (RMSD). The illustrated representative conformation
was averaged from the last 2-ns MD simulation and derived from the
first repetition of each system. The distance was measured by sidechain-centroids
between residues unless explicitly specified.
