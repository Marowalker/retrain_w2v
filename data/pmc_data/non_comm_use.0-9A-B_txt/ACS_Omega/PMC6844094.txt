The adherence of underwater air bubbles
to surfaces is a serious
cause of malfunction in applications such as microfluidics, transport,
and space devices. However, realizing spontaneous and additional unpowered
transport of underwater air bubbles inside tubes remains challenging.
Although superhydrophilic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tubes are attracting
attention as air bubble repellents, superhydrophilic PDMS, which is
fabricated via oxygen plasma treatment, has a disadvantage in that
it is weak against aging. Here, we present a tube with the ability
to self-remove air bubbles, which overcomes the drawback of rapid
aging. PDMS containing Silwet L-77 with a hierarchical nano–microstructure
exhibiting subaqueous aerophobicity was fabricated. We conducted adherence
and saturation experiments of air bubbles using the fabricated PDMS
tube with Silwet L-77 to investigate the mechanism of bubbles adhering
to and separating from the fabricated tube surface. The developed
PDMS with Silwet L-77 exhibits a strong self-removal effect with an
air bubble removal of 97.7%. The adherence and saturation experiments
suggest that the transparent superhydrophilic–underwater aerophobic
PDMS is a potentially exceptional tool for spontaneously separating
air bubbles attached to tube surfaces.

1 Introduction
The
unique wetting behavior of many natural surfaces such as a
lotus leaf and a water strider has been of great interest and an inspiration
for many applications such as self-cleaning, anti-icing, and anti-fogging.1−5 Superhydrophobic surfaces are characterized by a high water contact
angle (greater than 150°) and a low sliding angle (less than
10°). In contrast, superhydrophilic surfaces are generally defined
by very low water contact angles (less than 10°), which means
that they allow complete dispersion of water droplets in a matter
of seconds. In recent years, the behavior of this special wettability
surface in water has attracted wide attention considering the frequent
occurrence of air bubbles in water, which may cause severe damage
to various systems.

Considering that buoyancy is proportional
to the volume and adhesive
force is proportional to the area, adhesive force becomes relatively
stronger with decreasing size. Accordingly, a problem arises where
adhesive force becomes more dominant than buoyancy in microfluidics
devices.6,7 Furthermore, in transportation devices,
such as heat exchangers or artificial blood vessels, air bubbles trapped
in pipelines often accumulate and cause blockage to fluid transportation.8−10 Air bubbles are also problematic in space devices because buoyancy
is not observed in environments without gravitational force.11,12 Several workarounds have been investigated to address the problem
of air bubbles attached to such surfaces. In an effort to create bubble-repellent
surfaces, special wettability surfaces such as superhydrophilic materials
have been used. Despite few exceptions,13 superhydrophilic surfaces generally exhibit underwater superaerophobicity
and superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit underwater superaerophilicity—with
superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces, air bubbles behave
similar to oil droplets in water.14−16 Superaerophobic surfaces
are generally defined by a high air bubble contact angle (greater
than 150°) and a low sliding angle (less than 10°). In contrast,
superaerophilic surfaces are generally defined by very low air bubble
contact angles (less than 10°).17−21 Therefore, air bubbles frequently adhere to a superhydrophobic
surface but not to superhydrophilic surfaces. Many studies have attempted
to fabricate superhydrophilic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (aerophobic),
but the fabrication processes are very complicated and involve oxygen
plasma treatment, which reduces the longevity of surface characteristics.22−24 Despite these disadvantages, oxygen plasma treatment is required
because it ensures high surface energy for attaining aerophobicity
in PDMS25−27 and PDMS surface modification is difficult using
other methods due to chemical inertness.27−29

In this
research, we fabricated a PDMS tube with hierarchical nano–microstructures
and superhydrophilicity–underwater-aerophobicity, using a method
of structure replication with the addition of Silwet L-77. Silwet
L-77 is a wetting agent and a type of silicone surfactant. Similar
to other surfactants, it comprises hydrophilic hydrophobic moieties
(Figure S1).30 Silwet L-77 does not react with PDMS and spreads evenly in PDMS
when mixed. When curing PDMS, mixed Silwet L-77 is evenly distributed
in PDMS.31,32 The prepared PDMS tube successfully realizes
self-removal of air bubbles attached to the surface. We conducted
an underwater air bubble adhesion experiment to investigate the mechanism
of bubbles adhering to and separating from the fabricated tube surface.
The tube exhibited excellent self-removal performance, and the bubbles
were found to be removed when their accumulation reached a saturated
state. This is the surfactant diffusion phenomenon that occurs in
PDMS containing surfactant such as Silwet L-77, and it has been confirmed
that the same phenomenon occurs in underwater environments.33,34 The developed process used Silwet L-77 to fabricate the superhydrophilic
PDMS, which exhibits underwater-aerophobicity. This surface overcame
the drawback of rapid weakening aerophobicity of O2 plasma-treated
surface with aging.35−37 Overall, the developed PDMS tube exhibited a high
self-removal ratio for air bubble formation and excellent stability,
and it can be stable in air. We believe that the information gained
from this research can greatly simplify air bubble detachment methods
for solving air-bubble related issues in various transportation pipelines.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Industrial
Al (99+%, Aluko
Co., LTD) plates and rods were used to prepare replica molds. Al plates
of 30 × 30 mm were used to prepare molds for flat replicated
surfaces, and Al rods were used for tube-type replicated surfaces.
The diameter and length of the Al rods for replication were 10 and
100 mm, respectively. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
and n-hexane (C6H14) were purchased
from Samyoung Chemical Co., Ltd. Heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl
trichlorosilane (HDFS) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. PDMS (Sylgard
184, monomer and curing agent) and Silwet L-77 were purchased from
Dow Corning.

2.2 Replication of PDMS/PDMS
Silwet L-77 with
Mold
An ultrasonically cleaned Al plate was etched in 1 M
NaOH solution at room temperature for 10 s for cleaning. After washing
the plate in distilled water, it was etched in 1 M HCl solution at
70 °C for 1 min to fabricate microcubic structures. Then, the
plate was immersed in 1 M NaOH solution at room temperature for 1
min and dipped in deionized (DI) boiling water at 100 °C for
10 min to fabricate nanoflake structures. After the process, the fabricated
aluminum plate developed nano–micro hierarchical structure
and superhydrophilicity. The plate was dipped in a 1:1000 solution
(v/v) of HDFS in n-hexane for 10 min to apply a superhydrophobic
coating onto the surface. By dipping the Al mold in the HDFS solution,
a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which is a horizontal molecular
coating with low surface energy on the target surface. After the SAM
coating on the surface, the surface became superhydrophobic by very
low surface energy developed on the surface without any structure
change.38

PDMS and PDMS with Silwet
L-77 were added to the abovementioned molds. The replication process
was inspired by the work of Kim.39 Sylgard
184 and a curing agent were applied in a weight ratio of 10:1 to the
prepared surface in order to generate a superhydrophobic plate. In
the case of the superhydrophilic plate, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt % of
Silwet L-77 was added. The PDMS and mold structure were placed in
a vacuum chamber for 2 h to remove bubbles between them, such that
the structure adhered well to the surface. Then, the surface was maintained
horizontal at room temperature until holes that formed as air bubbles
escaped were flattened. With the addition of Silwet L-77, viscosity
increased, depending on the ratio of Silwet L-77; the waiting time
also varied depending on the ratio. After flattening, it was cured
in a 70 °C chamber for 6 h and the fabricated PDMS was carefully
removed from the mold. For replicating the superhydrophobic surface,
the same procedure was applied but Silwet L-77 was not added. In addition,
to prepare the bare surface, the same procedure was applied, but without
the Silwet L-77 and nano–micro fabricated molds. All molds
of bare surfaces had flat surfaces.

2.3 Fabrication
of Aluminum Mold and PDMS Tube
To fabricate the Al mold,
an Al rod was cleaned with 0.5 M NaOH
solution for 1 min. Subsequently, microstructures were formed by etching
the Al rod for 15 min in 2.5 M HCl solution. Then, impurities in the
Al rod were cleaned by dipping it in a desmut solution, which was
composed of DI water, nitric acid, and ammonium bifluoride (50:50:3
weight ratio), for 45 s. Nanostructures on the Al rod were formed
by soaking in a 95 °C DI water for 5 min after immersing the
microstructured Al rod in a 0.5 M NaOH solution for 5 s. From the
above process, a micro- and nano-structured Al rod was obtained. To
prevent adhesion between the Al rod and PDMS replica, an antiadhesion
layer was generated on the Al rod surface by soaking it in a coating
solution for 10 min. The soaking solution was a mixture of n-hexane and HDFS (1000:1 volume ratio).

Silwet was
mixed with PDMS prepolymer (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt %), which was composed
of a PDMS monomer and a curing agent with a 10:1 weight ratio. Then,
the Silwet–PDMS mixture was diluted to increase fluidity by
adding 20 wt % toluene. The mixture was degassed in vacuum for 30
min, and the mixture was filled between the outer cases and the Al
mold. Thereafter, the air trapped between the Silwet–PDMS mixture
and micro–nano structures of the mold was eliminated in vacuum
for 30 min. Then, the Silwet–PDMS mixture was cured in a 70
°C oven for more than 8 h. From the above process, the micro–nano
structured Silwet–PDMS was obtained. To obtain the superhydrophilic
PDMS tube, the cured polymer was detached from the Al mold by removing
the outer cases, and the cured polymer was dipped in an n-hexane solution for 20 min. In this process, the polymer was separated
from the mold by swelling. The swollen tube was dried in air for 20
min, after which the superhydrophilic PDMS tube was finally obtained.
Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were conducted at 25 °C.
The replication process was inspired by the work of Kim (Figure S2).40

2.4 Bubble Adhesion Test
A PDMS tube
containing Silwet L-77 was prepared as shown in Figure 1a. The fabrication method for the internal
structure of the tube was adopted from Kim,40 where Silwet L-77 was added to impart superhydrophilicity. The PDMS
tube containing Silwet L-77 was more rigid than the original PDMS
tube but it had sufficient flexibility. Figure 1b schematically shows the experimental setup
of the bubble adhesion test. The experiment was carried out in a water-filled
tank with a water pump and bubble stone, and a syringe was set outside
the tank to inject air bubbles. The generated air bubbles flow along
the water and adhere to the tube surface. Bare, superhydrophobic,
and superhydrophilic surfaces were applied to the tubes, and comparative
experiments were conducted with each tube. For each experiment, 5
mL of air bubble was injected to the system for 5 s with the syringe
pump; the water flow rate was 13.2 mL/s. The behavior of air bubbles
in the transparent tube was observed above the water surface.

setup for bubble adhesion test (b).

2.5 Characterization
The droplet contact
angle and sliding angle were measured with 5 μL DI water droplets
using the SmartDrop equipment (Femtofab, Korea) at ambient temperature.
The air bubble contact angle and sliding angle were measured with
5 μL of air bubbles also using SmartDrop at ambient temperature.
All contact angles and sliding angles were obtained as the average
of five measurements at different positions on the surface. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) measurements and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) were performed using a JEOL JSM-7401F with Dual
EDS field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed using the SPM system
(Veeco Instruments Inc., USA). Oxygen plasma treatment was performed
using a plasma surface treatment system COVANCE (Femto Science Inc.,
Korea).

3 Results and Discussion
When PDMS is replicated on a micro–nano structured aluminum
surface, even nanostructures are replicated well (Figure 2a).39 However, PDMS with 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77 had higher viscosity than
general PDMS because of which efficient penetration between the structures
could not be achieved. As a result, a roughness (Ra) reduction of about 29% was observed under AFM (Figure 2b). Ra for the Al
mold and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 wt % PDMS were 564, 534, 432, and 404 nm, respectively
(Figure S3). The surface roughness reduction
by Silwet with increasing weight percentage agrees well with the previous
studies reporting on the increase of Young’s modulus for Silwet
L-77-added PDMS.41 This increase of Young’s
modulus makes it harder to replicate micro- and nano-structures from
the mold. Despite this reduction of surface roughness, Figure 2a shows that the micro–nano
hierarchical structure of PDMS containing Silwet L-77 was well maintained
and the surface was successfully replicated. Although viscosity increases
with the addition of Silwet L-77, it is advantageous to add a large
amount of Silwet L-77 to induce superhydrophilicity in PDMS. Nevertheless,
the amount of Silwet L-77 in this study was limited to 0.5 wt % in
order to minimize the effects on roughness and surface structure.

(i,iii) and replicated PDMS with 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77 (ii,iv). (b)
Surface roughness measurement of replicated PDMS (i) and replicated
PDMS with 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77 (ii).

The atomic composition of PDMS was investigated through EDS to
confirm the presence of Silwet L-77 at the surface and bulk. As shown
in Table S1, the oxygen/silicon rates of
the 0, 0.3, and 0.5 wt % samples were 0.486, 0.598, and 0.689, respectively.
The oxygen/silicon rate increased with increasing Silwet L-77 wt %
of PDMS. These results show the same trends as those of the previous
studies.42 Additionally, the 0.653 oxygen/silicon
rate of the 0.5 wt % bulk sample indicates that Silwet L-77 was well
spread from the surface to bulk.

We fabricated the superhydrophobic
surfaces by replicating micro–nano
structures on the PDMS surface and prepared a bare PDMS surface. The
bare PDMS surface has a flat surface without micro–nano structures
and no addition of Silwet L-77. For the hydrophilic/superhydrophilic
surface, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt % of Silwet L-77 was added to the micro–nano
fabricated PDMS surface to grant superhydrophilic properties. The
contact angles were measured with a water droplet of 5 μL and
the measured values were 158.7° (superhydrophobic), 109.0°
(bare), 28.5° (PDMS with 0.1% Silwet L-77), 17.4° (PDMS
with 0.3% Silwet L-77), and 6.5° (PDMS with 0.5% Silwet L-77),
respectively (Figure 3a). In particular, the contact angle for PDMS containing Silwet L-77
was measured after 1 min of saturation to consider the phenomenon
of surfactant diffusion, in which water droplets on the PDMS containing
the surfactant spread over a constant time interval.33 Similar to previous research, the replicated PDMS exhibited
superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 152° and the
bare PDMS showed a contact angle of 110°. It is noteworthy that
Silwet L-77 was added to the replicated PDMS to induce superhydrophilicity
at a sliding angle of 8.4° (Figure 3b). In this manner, a hydrophilic surface
that can be stable in air could be fabricated. We also measured contact
angle hysteresis and sliding angles. The measured contact angle hysteresis
were 27.6° and 7.5° and sliding angles were 21.7° and
40.3° for superhydrophobic and bare surface, respectively (Figure S4a). Although the superhydrophobic surface
shows lower sliding angle, the hysteresis was relatively high. This
result shows that the surface has high roughness with random micro–nano
structures, which were generated by etching. The structure size on
the surface possibly show large differences between the etching and
micro machining processes. In this article, the nano–micro
structured PDMS with 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77 is defined as a superhydrophilic
surface considering its wettability. We measured the underwater air
bubble contact angle and sliding angle for superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic,
and untreated PDMS surfaces with only 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77 added.
The contact angles for 5 μL of air bubbles were 28.5°,
114.3°, and 152.9° on the superhydrophobic, bare PDMS with
Silwet, and the superhydrophilic surfaces, respectively. This showed
that the underwater air bubble contact angle on each surface matches
the tendency of the water contact angle and wettability. The measured
contact angle hysteresis were 30.2° and 13.3° and sliding
angles were 8.4° and 43.2° for the superhydrophilic and
bare surface, respectively (Figure S4b).
The high contact angle hysteresis can also be attributed to the irregularity
of surface structure. Bubbles were observed to be pinned to some irregular
point before sliding off the surface. According to the Cassie–Baxter eq 1, the droplet contact angle
in air (2) and underwater air bubble contact
angle (3) on solid surfaces are shown in the
following equations.43 1   2   3  where cos θE is the equilibrium
contact angle, cos θ* is the apparent contact angle, and f is ratio of the surface in contact with the droplet or
bubble. The droplet contact angle was measured on nano–micro
structured superhydrophobic PDMS, and the air bubble was measured
on the nano–micro structured aerophobic PDMS with Silwet L-77.

Figure 3 (a) Droplet
contact angle of superhydrophobic, bare, and hydrophilic/superhydrophilic
surfaces. (b) Contact angle and sliding angle of underwater air bubbles
on bare, superhydrophobic, and superhydrophilic (0.5 wt % Silwet L-77)
surfaces.

The value of air bubble contact
area on the aerophobic surface fPDMS′ (0.186) calculated
by the above equations is 78% higher than the
value of water droplet contact area on the superhydrophobic surface fPDMS (0.104). As a result, the superhydrophilic
surface showed a superaerophobic property with an underwater contact
angle of 150° or higher, but the superhydrophilic surface was
found to have a larger contact area than the superhydrophobic surface
in air. However, because it still has a small contact area of less
than 0.2, superaerophobicity of the surface can be deduced. This is
a phenomenon in which water is trapped between superhydrophilic surface
structures and air bubbles cannot make contact with the surface in
the aqueous environment, such as the behavior of water droplets on
superhydrophobic surfaces in the atmosphere. Similarly, the bubble
sliding angle of the superhydrophilic surface was very low at 8.4°,
which is in contrast to superhydrophobic surfaces with very high bubble
drop sliding angles. This is because the bubble pinned to the surface
structure of the superhydrophobic surface in a flattened shape, but
the pinning phenomenon does not appear in the air bubble on the superhydrophilic
surface.

Experimental results of the bubble adhering test for
the bare,
superhydrophobic, and superhydrophilic surfaces in the fabricated
system are shown in Figure 4. Each tube had minute air bubbles in its initial state (Figure 4a(i)), which is very
small compared to the amount of air bubbles injected thereafter. The
initial minute bubbles are the small amount of bubbles that adhered
to the surface without being removed by the water when it first flowed
in the tube. Immediately after injecting 5 mL of air bubbles into
each tube, the three wettability surfaces exhibited different behaviors
of air bubble adhesion (Figure 4a(ii)). After waiting for the air bubbles to stabilize for
a while, the experiment was terminated when there was no further bubble
movement (Figure 4a(iii)).
The ratio of air bubble area in the entire tube area of Figure 4a(ii,iii) was measured and
compared to determine the self-removal ratio. In the superhydrophobic
tube, the surface showed an aerophilic property in the underwater
environment with a large area of air pockets developed inside the
tube surface. On the tube surface, the attachment of air pockets is
different from that of air bubbles. Unlike air bubbles, air pockets
are large flat air layers merged along the tube length direction.
Different sizes of air pockets are shown in Figure 4a(A), and one large air pocket in Figure 4a(B). These air pockets
adhered to the surface very strongly, such that they did not disperse
with the water flow inside the tube, and they were difficult to remove
to within 10% even after reaching the saturated state (Figure 4b). In the superhydrophilic
tube, the surface showed an aerophobic property in the underwater
environment, with air bubbles adhering to the surface in the shape
of a bubble. Immediately after air bubble injection, the area of bubbles
adhered to the surface was 67.8%, which is higher than that of the
superhydrophobic tube surface (64.5%). There are two reasons for the
similarity in the bubble adhesion area of the two surfaces. First,
the observed area of the bubble shape is larger than the actual contact
area between air bubbles and the surface. In the case of air pockets,
the area of the air layer attached to the large surface is accurately
observed. This is because air pockets are attached to the surface
with low contact angle, and the edges of air pockets have low curvature.
However, in the case of the air bubbles, with their high contact angle,
their edges have very high curvature. Therefore, the area observed
from the vertical view is exaggerated. Moreover, air bubbles have
even higher rate of edges in the observed area than air pockets. Second,
this phenomenon is explained by surfactant diffusion. The superhydrophilic
tube contains Silwet L-77, a kind of surfactant, which causes surfactant
diffusion on the tube surface when wetted with water.33,34,44−46 The surfactant
is diffused from the PDMS surface to water. When the surfactant diffuses
in water, the surface tension of water decreases. The droplet contact
angle and the bubble contact angle were measured considering this
phenomenon. Because of this phenomenon, the wettability of the superhydrophilic
tube was observed to change over time as surface tension decreased.34 In contrast, air bubbles were observed to be
fastened in water (Figure 4c). Surfactant diffusion did not occur at the air–PDMS
boundary. The surfactant diffused only at the water–PDMS boundary.
Therefore, when the surface is occupied by air bubbles, the surfactant
diffuses only in water around the air bubbles. Consequently, the surface
tension of water around the bubble drops to easily penetrate into
the bubble–PDMS boundary because of which the bubbles appear
to be fastened by water. Moreover, air bubble fastening induces the
air bubble self-removal effect. As shown in Figure 4a(iii,C), most bubbles were removed at the
saturation state and the bubble area ratio was reduced by 97.7% (Figure 4b). This is in contrast
to the removal of less than 30% of the air bubbles during saturation
in the bare tube, where bubble shape and air pockets were observed
(Figure 4a(A),b).

(iii) saturation states on (A) bare, (B) hydrophobic, and (C) hydrophilic
tube surfaces. (b) Bubble area ratio and self-removal ratio by tube

adhesion.

We compared PDMS with oxygen plasma
treatment, which is one of
the methods of inducing superhydrophilicity on PDMS surfaces and superhydrophilic
PDMS containing Silwet L-77 in terms of their stability in ambient
air. The surface showed excellent surface droplet contact angle and
underwater air bubble contact angle after the oxygen plasma treatment.
The oxygen plasma-treated PDMS surface shows better aerophobic effect
at the beginning of the test. However, as is well known, oxygen plasma
treatment has serious aging problem, which is hydrophobic recovery
in ambient air.36 The surface that comes
into contact with air loses its OH group, thus losing its hydrophilicity
rapidly. We measured the air bubble contact angle of the surface experiencing
aging (Figure 5). Within
the first 10 h, the surface suddenly lost its hydrophilicity and the
air bubble contact angle slowly decreased. These results show that
underwater air bubbles are propagated from the Cassie state to the
Wenzel state at about 100°, which is also in agreement with previous
studies.36 An underwater aging test was
also conducted under conditions matching those of the expected application.
The test was conducted for 2 weeks at a flow of 13.2 mL/min, same
as the bubble adhesion test. After 2 weeks of underwater aging test,
the oxygen plasma-treated PDMS surface maintained the bubble contact
angle of 160°. However, the bubble contact angle of 0.5 wt %
Silwet L-77-added surface decreased from 153° to 134°. As
shown in Figure S5, no surface structure
change was observed. Therefore, the bubble contact angle drop in the
underwater aging test can be attributed to surfactant diffusion. After
2 weeks of underwater aging, a significant amount of surfactant diffused
to the water, which weakened the aerophobicity of the Silwet L-77-added
PDMS surface. This result is consistent with that of the previous
studies.34,45 After the experiments, the results of EDS
showed that the carbon, oxygen, and silicon ratios were 33.39, 24.65,
and 41.96, respectively, and the oxygen/silicone ratio was 0.587.
It can be seen that this is significantly reduced compared to the
oxygen/silicon ratio (≥0.650) of the 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77-added
PDMS (Table S1). It is also lower than
the oxygen/silicon ratio (0.598) of the 0.3 wt % Silwet L-77-added
PDMS, indicating that leaching of surfactant occurred in the 0.5 wt
% Silwet L-77-added PDMS.

against aging time
under ambient air conditions for replicated PDMS with 5 wt % Silwet
L-77 and replicated PDMS with O2 plasma treatment.

We conducted further experiments to find the maximum
operating
conditions required for bubble removal. Bubble removal occurs well
at faster flow rates, and the bubbles experience greater force from
the fluid in the tube. For this reason, we measured the minimum flow
rate for bubble self-removal of each tube. Experiments with the bare,
superhydrophobic, and superhydrophilic samples showed that the lowest
flow rates for bubble self-removal were 23.9, 31.5, and 9.5 mL/s,
respectively (Figure S6). Each sample is
identical to the sample used in Figure 4, and it can be seen that 0.5 wt % Silwet L-77-added
PDMS exhibits bubble self-removal even at the lowest flow rate.

4 Conclusions
We successfully fabricated a PDMS tube
with hierarchical nano–micro
structures, and by adding a silicon surfactant (5 wt % Silwet L-77),
air-stable aerophobic characteristics could be achieved. SEM images,
AFM images, and measured contact-angle, and sliding-angle showed that
this PDMS has the requisite surface roughness and wettability for
efficient self-removal of air bubbles. In the subsequent air bubble
adhesion experiment, a similar ratio of bubbles adhered to the superhydrophobic,
bare, and superhydrophilic surfaces at the initial state. However,
the superhydrophilic tube (aerophobic surface) showed an efficient
self-removal of 97.7% through surfactant diffusion in the saturated
state, in contrast to the bare and superhydrophobic surfaces, which
showed low bubble removal efficiencies of 28.5 and 8.3%, respectively.
In addition, aging experiments confirmed that the proposed surface
exhibits air-stable aerophobicity unlike the aerophobic surface generated
through oxygen plasma treatment. Therefore, considering the behavior
of bubbles in the tubes over time, the air-stable PDMS tube with aerophobicity
has high potential as a useful tool for spontaneously detaching air
bubbles from tubes.
