Rational
understanding of the structural features involving different
noncovalent interactions is necessary to design a liquid crystal (LC)
or an organogelator. Herein, we report the effect of the number and
positions of alkoxy chains on the self-assembly induced physical properties
of a few π-conjugated molecules. For this purpose, we designed
and synthesized three C3-symmetrical molecules
based on oligo(p-phenylenevinylene), C3OPV1–3. The self-assembly properties of these molecules are studied
in the solid and solution states. All of the three molecules follow
the isodesmic self-assembly pathway. Upon cooling from isotropic melt, C3OPV1 having nine alkoxy chains (−OC12H25) formed a columnar phase with two-dimensional rectangular lattice
and retained the LC phase even at room temperature. Interestingly,
when one of the −OC12H25 groups from
each of the end benzene rings is knocked out, the resultant molecule, C3OPV2 lost the LC property, however, transformed as a gelator in toluene
and n-decane. Surprisingly, when the −OC12H25 group from the middle position is removed,
the resultant molecule C3OPV3 failed to form either the LC or the gel phases.

Introduction
Liquid crystals (LC)
and gels are two distinct classes of soft
materials of contemporary importance from the view point of basic
and applied research.1−12 Although a fundamental understanding of LCs has helped rational
design and application of several subclasses,1,2,4 the case of molecular gelators is mostly
serendipitous.3,10 However, the continued effort
over the years has helped researchers to have a better understanding
of the requirements of gelator design.3−12 The knowledge acquired over the years in this direction has helped
scientists to come up with several classes of molecular gelators.
π-Gelators are one such class of functional soft materials.5−7,9−12

C3-symmetrical platforms that are well
exploited for the design of columnar LCs have also been reported to
be suitable for the design of organogelators.13−17 Therefore, we decided to explore the potential of C3-symmetrical systems with one of the well-studied
π-gelators, oligo(p-phenylenevinylenes) (OPV)5,18−28 for the design of LC29−31-based π-gelators32−37 to create multifunctional soft materials. In this process, we encountered
an interesting observation of remarkable property variations of a C3-symmetrical OPV molecule (C3OPV1) when the terminal
alkoxy chains are knocked out from different positions, to form the
molecules C3OPV2 and C3OPV3. The chemical structures of C3OPV1–3 are shown
in Figure 1.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the C3-symmetrical OPV
molecules, C3OPV1–3 is shown in Schemes S1–S3. The O-alkylated benzaldehyde
derivatives 2a–c and the diethyl
4-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl)benzylphosphonate 7 were
prepared as per reported procedures (Schemes S1 and S2).38,39 The Wittig–Horner–Emmons
olefination reaction of 2a–c with
the phosphonate 7 afforded compounds 8a–c in 83–85% yield, which were then deprotected using
trifluoroacetic acid to get the aldehydes 9a–c in 87–92% yield. Afterward, the aldehydes 9a–c were subjected to the Wittig–Horner–Emmons
olefination reaction with diethyl(4-nitrobenzyl)phosphonate, resulting
in the nitro derivatives 10a–c in
80–85% yield. The nitro compounds 10a–c were then reduced to the amino compounds 11a–c using stannous chloride as the reducing agent
in 80–85% yield. The OPV amine derivatives 11a–c were then converted into the corresponding C3-symmetrical OPVs by treating with trimesic
acid trichloride (Scheme S3).28,29 All of the reactions were carried out under dark condition to avoid
the cis–trans isomerization of the olefinic double bond. The
final molecules C3OPV1–3 were characterized
using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(MS). Details of the synthetic procedures and the spectral characterization
data of all intermediates are provided in the Supporting Information.

Having obtained the C3-symmetrical
OPV molecules in a pure form, our first objective was to study their
physical properties. Optical polarizing microscopy (OPM) revealed
that these compounds have high clearing temperature (the temperature
at which the transition takes place from mesophase to the liquid state)
and therefore get charred above 260 °C. Thus, to avoid such issues,
the as-prepared sample was first heated to 260 °C and slowly
cooled back to room temperature with a cooling rate of 5 K min–1. In the case of C3OPV1, upon cooling, a clear dendritic
growth was observed with subsequent formation of strongly birefringent
LC texture (Figure 2a). With further cooling, a mosaic pattern developed, which got retained
right down to room temperature (Figure 2b). In a few cases, focal conics with stunted ends
and stripes on the back of them were observed (Figure S1).

Figure 2 OPM images of C3OPV1 (a) at 250 °C and (b) at 28
°C
upon cooling the sample from higher temperature (260 °C).

In view of the above features
and with the support of the X-ray
results to be described below, we identify the mesophase as a columnar
phase with two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal/rectangular lattice at higher/lower
temperatures. The observation of stripes in the low-temperature region
further supports the rectangular nature of the lattice.40,41 The other two derivatives C3OPV2 and C3OPV3 did not show any characteristic
LC textures. Because of the decomposition of compounds at the clearing
point, we were unable to characterize phase transitions using differential
scanning calorimetry.

It has been reported that C3-symmetrical
design can generate large free volume if the compounds stack into
columns and, consequently, destabilize the columnar stacks. However,
the presence of 1,2,3-trialkoxybenzene groups can provide sufficient
packing volume of the side chains to promote columnar organization.42−45 Thus, to gain more insight about columnar mesophase of C3OPV1, detailed
temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) at different temperatures
by cooling down the sample from 250 °C to room temperature (28
°C) has been carried out. The main panel of Figure 3 shows the XRD profiles of C3OPV1 in the low-angle region, obtained at 200 and 28 °C. At these
temperatures, a very intense and sharp peak at low angles and a diffuse
maximum at wide angles (inset B of Figure 3) were seen. In addition, a very weak but
sharp peak was seen at intermediate angles. The intensity of this
peak increases as the sample is cooled from 250 °C but interestingly,
starts decreasing below 150 °C. Concomitantly, two diffuse maxima,
one at the same angle as this peak and another at a slightly lower
angle, developed (inset A of Figure 3).

Figure 3 XRD profile of C3OPV1 at 200 °C (red) and 28 °C
(blue).
The low-angle region is shown in the main panel; the expansion (A)
and the wide-angle portion (B) are shown in the inset.

The spacings corresponding to peaks at the lowest
and intermediate
angle are in the ratio of 1:1/√7. Generally, for a hexagonal
columnar packing, the ratio of the spacing of the small-angle peaks
should be 1:1/√3:1/2:1/√7, etc.46−48 For C3OPV1, considering the high-temperature region (T >
150
°C), the lattice can be indexed to be a hexagonal one, with the
second (1/√3) and third (1/2) peaks absent. It may be recalled
that there have been reports36,49,50 wherein such a feature of certain peaks was found missing. In the
present case, we can perhaps attribute it to the known tendency of
the helical packing of the C3-symmetrical
amide units by a threefold H-bonding interaction.17,49 At temperatures below 150 °C, the reflections could be indexed
to a centered rectangular lattice, corroborating the OPM observations
mentioned above. The results of the measured and calculated d-spacing, miller indices, and lattice parameters are summarized
in Table S1. The effect of temperature
on the spacing corresponding to the lowest angle peak is shown in Figure 4. The spacing increases
somewhat abruptly around 150 °C, which can be associated with
the transformation from a hexagonal to rectangular lattice.

Figure 4 Thermal variation
of the spacing of the low-angle peak.

A feature depicted in the inset A of Figure 3 that needs to be commented on is the weakening
of the lattice reflections—specifically the reflections (21)
at high temperature and (15) at low temperature—on cooling
the sample below 150 °C. This observation is surprising because
till room temperature, the mesophase remains the same. Even if there
is a transition to a disordered phase, it is difficult to imagine
that any pretransition effect would be spread over such a large temperature
range. A possible explanation is that, at higher temperatures (T > 150 °C), the chains that would have significant
gauche conformations owing to the substantial free space available
may still permit a slightly better interaction between the cores of
the neighboring molecules in the column. At lower temperatures, when
the chains are quite stretched, adopting the all-trans conformation,
a secondary effect may start dominating. The threefold H-bonding interaction
(Figure S2) between the adjacent molecules
in the column leads to a packing of the molecules in such a way that
there is an angle of twist between them.16,17,49,51 Such a requirement
would weaken the lattice ordering, resulting in lower intensity for
the reflections with higher Miller indices.

For a better understanding
of the self-assembly, the absorption
and emission spectra of all of the three molecules were monitored
in different solvents and the results are tabulated in Table S2. The absorption spectra of C3OPV1 (1 ×
10–4 M) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene showed
almost similar spectral features, with a maximum around 380 nm (Figure S3a). For C3OPV2, the absorption spectrum
in THF (1 × 10–4 M) was found to be similar
to that of C3OPV1, with a maximum at 380 nm (Figure S3b). On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of C3OPV2 in toluene (1 × 10–4 M) showed blue-shifted
(10 nm) absorption, with a maximum at 370 nm (Figure S3b). In the case of C3OPV3, the absorption maximum
in THF (1 × 10–4 M) was found at 370 nm (Figure S3c). The blue shift in the absorption
maximum of C3OPV3 in THF when compared to that of the other two molecules
could be due to the absence of an alkoxy group in the para position
of the terminal benzene ring of the OPV unit. As in the case of C3OPV2, the absorption maximum of C3OPV3 in toluene (1 × 10–4 M) also showed a blue shift of 10 nm (Figure S3c). In addition, both C3OPV2 and C3OPV3 displayed an additional
shoulder band at longer wavelengths (425 nm), which disappeared at
higher temperatures. From the absorption features of the molecules
in THF and toluene, it is evident that both the C3OPV2 and C3OPV3 could
form self-assembly in toluene, whereas it is less obvious in the case
of C3OPV1.

To gather insight about the mechanism of the self-assembly
process,52−59 temperature-dependent absorption studies were carried out. A 1 ×
10–4 M solution of the compound in toluene was used
for the studies. The absorption corresponding to the aggregation band
at 425 nm was monitored as a function of temperature. The fraction
of aggregates (αagg) was then plotted against the
temperature. Figure S4 shows a comparison
of the melting transition curves obtained for C3OPV1 and C3OPV2 and a
mixture of 10% (v/v) C3OPV2 in C3OPV1 (1 × 10–4 M).
From this plot, it is clear that the melting transition temperature, Tm (the temperature at which the αagg is 50%) for C3OPV1 is 310.8 K and that for C3OPV2 is 321.5 K. The
difference in the Tm values shows that C3OPV2 forms stronger assembly than C3OPV1. To understand the effect of C3OPV2 on the self-assembly of C3OPV1, we added 10 vol % 1 × 10–4 M C3OPV2 solution to C3OPV1 and the absorbance was
monitored as a function of temperature. Interestingly, the melting
transition temperature was found to increase from 310.8 to 314.8 K.
This result implies that the presence of C3OPV2 increases the stability
of the assembly formed by C3OPV1 due to the co-assembly of both molecules.
The temperature-dependent absorption spectrum can be fitted with an
isodesmic or equal-K model, in which each reversible
step in the assembly pathway is characterized by a single association
constant (Ke)51−53,58,59 and the results are
summarized in Figure S4 and Table 1. The gradual growth of the
stacks with decreasing temperature, as shown in Figure S4, is a characteristic feature of isodesmic assembly.
When compared with C3OPV1, the degree of polymerization (DPN) and Ke are found to be higher for C3OPV2, indicating a better assembly. The increase found in the degree
of polymerization (DPN) of C3OPV1 from 2.1 to 2.4 in the
presence of 10% (v/v) C3OPV2 suggests that C3OPV2 assists the assembly process
of C3OPV1.60

Subsequently, we studied the fluorescence properties
of C3OPV1–3 (1 × 10–4 M). For C3OPV1, the emission maximum in toluene and THF remained the same at 435
nm but the emission intensity was found to be less in the case of
toluene (Figure 5a).
In THF, C3OPV2 showed an emission maximum at 431 nm and in toluene,
the emission maximum displayed a red shift of 70 nm (λmax = 504 nm) with a broadening of the spectrum (Figure 5b). The quenching of fluorescence with broadening
implies the formation of supramolecular assembly of C3OPV2 in toluene.
The C3OPV3 molecule displayed almost similar emission features in
both toluene and THF with slightly enhanced emission in toluene (Figure 5c).

and toluene (1 × 10–4 M); λex = 375 nm.

To know the nature of
interaction between the molecules and with
the solvents and also to understand the kind of assembly formed in
these solvents, detailed morphological studies were carried out. In
the case of nonpolar solvents, the molecule–solvent interactions
are minimum and hence the molecule–molecule noncovalent forces
may play a major role in the self-assembly of molecules.8,61−64 With the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM), the morphological
studies were carried out. In the case of C3OPV1, due to weak assembly
in toluene or other nonpolar solvents, the molecule–solvent
interaction will be more, resulting in spherical particles at a concentration
of 1 × 10–4 M (Figure 6a). At the same concentration, C3OPV2 in toluene
formed intertwined fibers of micrometer length, with an average diameter
of 250 nm (Figure 6b). The formation of these extended assemblies can be due to the
long-range interaction of C3OPV2 molecules via H-bonding, π-stacking,
and van der Waals interactions. On the other hand, C3OPV3 fails to form
such extended assembly and instead, assembles together to form spherical
particles (Figure 6c). The spherical particle size distribution of both C3OPV1 and C3OPV3 is given in Figure S5. In the case of C3OPV1, the size of the particle varies from 150 to 300 nm, with maximum
number of particles having an average size of 220 nm. Similarly, for C3OPV3, the size distribution is almost similar to that of C3OPV1, with
an average size of around 210 nm.

mica surface. In all of the cases, the concentration of the solution
used is 1 × 10–4 M.

The gelation properties of these molecules were then studied
and
it was found that only C3OPV2 was able to form gel (Table S3). The other two molecules failed to form gel in any
of the solvents tested. C3OPV2 was able to form gel in toluene, n-decane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, etc. As in the
case of other C3-symmetrical molecules, C3OPV2 needs very high concentration to form the gel.13,65 The minimal gelator concentration (MGC) for C3OPV2 in toluene is
4.65 mM. In cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, the MGC is found to
be 14.86 and 13.94 mM, respectively, which is almost 3 times higher
than that required for the gelation in toluene. Furthermore, a solvent-dependent
difference in the nature of the gel was noticed. In toluene, a transparent
gel was formed, whereas other solvents gels were found to be opaque
(Figure 7a–d).
The lack of gelation property of C3OPV1 and C3OPV3 can be rationalized on
the basis of their morphology. Gelation is basically the entrapment
of solvents inside a three-dimensional solid matrix of interconnected
network of fibers.3,10,63 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that C3OPV2 forms extended structures in the gel phase (Figure 7e,f). In n-decane, extended
sheetlike features are seen, whereas in toluene, large fiber bundles
are formed. However, the other two molecules, i.e., C3OPV1 and C3OPV3, were unable to form such sheets or fibrous assembly. Therefore, C3OPV1 and C3OPV3 could not entrap solvent molecules and therefore gelation
was not observed.

and under
UV light (λex = 365 nm), respectively. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of C3OPV2 (e) n-decane and (f) toluene gel, respectively.

The weak assembly of C3OPV1 in toluene can be attributed
to the
presence of nine alkoxy chains around the central C3 core, which facilitate high solubility for the molecule
in this solvent. At the same time, when one of the alkoxy chains from
each arm of the C3OPV1 is removed, as in the case of C3OPV2 or as
in the case of C3OPV3, the solubility in toluene and other nonpolar solvents
get reduced, forcing the molecule to form assembly with the help of
H-bonding, π–π stacking, and van der Waals interactions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study is an example of structural engineering
by which an LC mesophase forming C3-symmetrical
molecule can be transformed into an organogelator. C3OPV1, the molecule
with nine alkoxy chains at the periphery of the disc, shows mesomorphic
properties even at room temperature and the LC phase is identified
as columnar phase with 2D rectangular lattice. As the number of alkoxy
chains at the periphery decreases, the LC property disappears. C3OPV2, a molecule with alkoxy chains at 3,4-positions is able to gelate
organic solvents, whereas C3OPV3, a molecule with alkoxy chains at
3,5-positions, neither forms gel nor shows any LC properties. This
study illustrates the important role of alkoxy chains in the design
of functional molecules with distinctly different properties48,66−68 and hence can be applied to several of the existing
systems for their rational conversion to functional soft materials.

dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 6 h, and the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography on silica

transitions and optical anisotropy were observed using a Leica DFC
490 polarized light optical microscope, equipped with a Mettler TOLEDO
FP82HT (temperature programmer) heating and freezing stage.

X-ray
Diffraction
Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction
studies of the liquid crystalline phases were carried out on samples
filled in Lindemann capillaries and were held at required temperatures
using a Mettler hot stage and irradiated with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å). The apparatus essentially involved a high-resolution
X-ray powder diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) equipped
with a high-resolution fast detector, PIXCEL.

Optical Measurements
The electronic absorption spectra
were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis scanning spectrophotometer
equipped with peltier thermostatic cell holders. The fluorescence
spectra were recorded on a SPEX-Fluorolog F112X spectrofluorimeter.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM images were recorded under
ambient conditions using NTEGRA (NT-MDT) operated with a tapping mode
regime. Microfabricated TiN cantilever tips (NSG10) with a resonance
frequency of 299 kHz and a spring constant of S8 20–80 N m–1 were used. Samples for the imaging were prepared
by drop casting solution of C3OPV1–3 in toluene (1 × 10–4 M) on freshly cleaved mica surface. The samples were first air-dried
and further dried under vacuum.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM images were taken
on a Zeiss EVO 18 cryo SEM Special Edn with a variable pressure detector
working at 20–30 kV after sputtering with gold. Samples were
prepared by drop casting the gel on a freshly cleaved mica substrate.
They were kept overnight to allow slow evaporation of the solvent
and further dried in a vacuum desiccator for 12 h.
