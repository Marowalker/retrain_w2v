Liquid lubricants used in mechanical
applications are low-vapor-pressure
hydrocarbons modified with a small quantity of polar compounds. The
polar modifiers adsorbed on the surface of sliding solids dominate
the friction properties when the sliding surfaces are in close proximity.
However, a few methods are available for the characterization of the
adsorbed modifiers of a nanometer-scale thickness. In this study,
we applied frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy to evaluate
the vertical and lateral density distributions of the adsorbed modifier
in a real lubricant, namely, poly-α-olefin (PAO) modified with
an orthophosphoric acid oleyl ester. The liquid-induced force on the
probing tip was mapped on a plane that was perpendicular to the lubricant–iron
interface with a force sensitivity on the order of 10 pN. The PAO
in the absence of the ester modifier was directly exposed to the film,
which produced a few liquid layers parallel to the film surface with
layer-to-layer distances of 0.6–0.7 nm. A monomolecular layer
of the modifier was intermittently adsorbed with increasing ester
concentration in the bulk lubricant, with complete coverage seen at
20 ppm. The C18H35 chains of the oleyl esters
fluctuating in the lubricant produced a repulsive force on the tip,
which monotonically decayed with the tip-to-surface distance. The
dynamic friction coefficient of sliding steel–lubricant–steel
interfaces, which was separately determined using a friction tester,
was compared with the force map determined on the iron film immersed
in the corresponding lubricant. The complete monomolecular layer of
the ester modifier on the static lubricant–iron boundary is
a requirement for achieving smooth and stable friction at the sliding
interface.

Introduction
Most liquid lubricants
used in mechanical applications are low-vapor-pressure
hydrocarbons modified with a small quantity of polar compounds. The
polar modifiers are adsorbed on the surface of sliding solids, typically
steel objects. When the sliding surfaces are close, the adsorbed monomolecular1 or multimolecular2 layers of the modifiers dominate the contact across the sliding
interface, the sliding boundary in tribological terminology. In these
circumstances, which are recognized as boundary lubrication, the adsorbed
layers and hydrocarbon liquid covering the layers form an easily sheared
film to minimize adhesion and wear.3 Boundary
lubrication may also involve mechanochemical reactions on the sliding
interface. Reaction products, if any, provide layers with low shear
strength covering the solid, i.e., tribolayers. The viscosity of the
bulk lubricant plays a limited role in boundary lubrication. Controlling
the lubricants at the boundary is the key to smooth sliding and stable
friction.

The conception of boundary lubrication has been proposed
and accepted
since 1920. On the other hand, even today, it is not easy to characterize
adsorbed modifiers of a nanometer-scale thickness. They are always
buried in lubricant–solid interfaces. Electron-based methods
for surface analysis do not function there. In situ, hopefully, operando
methods working in lubricants should be developed since weakly adsorbed
modifiers leave the surface when the surrounding lubricant is removed.
The mass of adsorbed modifiers was determined with microbalance sensors.4,5 Infrared absorption,6−8 Raman scattering,9 and
sum-frequency generation10 provided vibrational
spectra of adsorbed modifiers to estimate their chemical structure.
The layer thickness of deuterium-labeled modifiers was evaluated in
a sub-nanometer precision by fitting neutron reflectivity as a function
of scattering vector length.11,12 Recently, Hirayama
et al.13 applied frequency-modulation atomic
force microscopy (FM-AFM) for visualizing palmitic acid modifier layers
on copper films immersed in a hexadecane-based model lubricant. The
layers were so soft that they required a 10 pN-order force sensitivity
for detecting the layer-induced force response.

In the present
study, a representative hydrocarbon lubricant in
commerce, poly-α-olefin, is modified with different quantities
of a phosphoric acid alkyl ester, one of the frequently used modifiers
in real lubricants.14 The presence or absence
of modifier layers is probed on iron films using FM-AFM. The vertical
as well as lateral distribution of the layers is visualized by mapping
layer-induced force on the probing tip. Furthermore, the dynamic friction
coefficient of steel–lubricant–steel interfaces is separately
determined with a friction tester. The macroscopic friction property
as a function of modifier quantity is compared with the nanometer-scale
distribution of the modifier layers.

Materials
Lubricants
Nonpolar poly-α-olefin (PAO) was modified
with orthophosphoric acid oleyl ester (C18AP). The chemical structure
of the two compounds is illustrated in Figure 1. PAO (Ineos, Durasyn164) containing decene
trimers (C30H62) as the major component was
purified with activated clay. The purified liquid possessed a dynamic
viscosity of 4 mm2 s–1 at 100 °C.
C18AP (Johoku Chemicals, JP-518) was a 1:1 mixture of the monoester
and diester of the phosphoric acid. The modifier concentrations were
adjusted at 0.2, 2, 20, and 200 ppm to simulate that in real lubricants,
ca. 200 ppm.

(PAO) used in this study. The longest (C20) alkyl chain
is depicted in the all-trans conformation. (b) Orthophosphoric
acid oleyl ester with n = 1 or 2 (C18AP).

Iron Films
Metallic iron was sputtered on silicon wafers
to produce 50 nm-thick films. The films were naturally oxidized in
air at room temperature (RT). Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite was
compared with the iron films as a benchmark of solid with little chemical
affinity to the phosphoric acid ester.

Results and Discussion
AFM Method
Frequency-modulation detection of force
on the probing tip was carried out with an SPM-8100FM microscope (Shimadzu).
In topographic imaging of iron films, the resonance oscillation of
a silicon cantilever (Nanoworld, PPP-NCHAuD) was mechanically excited
with a piezoactuator. The nominal spring constant of the cantilevers
was 42 N m–1. The oscillation amplitude was regulated
at a preset amplitude (A). When a lubricant-induced
conservative force was loaded on the tip, the resonance frequency
of cantilever oscillation (f) shifted accordingly.
The topography of the scanned film was traced with regulation of the
tip–surface distance by keeping the frequency shift (Δf) at a prefixed setpoint. The resonant frequency of the
cantilevers was 100–140 kHz, and the quality factor of oscillation
resonance was 2–3 in the lubricants. The typical spectrum of
thermally induced cantilever oscillation is shown in Figure 2. An iron film or graphite
wafer was fixed in a quartz Petri dish placed on the microscope stage
driven by a piezoelectric scanner. The dish was filled with 500 μL
of lubricant and then the cantilever assembly was put on top. Imaging
scans were conducted at RT.

Figure 2 Typical spectrum of cantilever oscillation in
PAO. Observed spectral
density is presented with dots. A Lorentzian function (red line) fitted
the observed data with a quality factor of 2 and a background spectral
density of 18 fm Hz–1/2.

Iron Film Topography
Figure 3 presents the topographic images of the iron
films observed in (a) pure PAO and (b) PAO containing 200 ppm C18AP,
which was the highest concentration evaluated in this study. The spherical
grains were recognized in the images. The lateral and vertical dimensions
of the grains were between 5 and 20 nm and between 1 and 3 nm, respectively.
The grain sizes were identical in both the films. However, the grain
topography was sharper in image (a) as compared with image (b) in Figure 3. The reduced sharpness
in image (b) could not be attributed to the different shapes of the
probing tip, although different cantilevers were used for acquiring
the two topographic images. A second set of images that were obtained
in the presence and absence of C18AP is shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The grains in the
C18AP-containing lubricant again exhibited features with reduced sharpness.
The reproducible results suggest that the iron films were most likely
covered by a soft material such as adsorbed C18AP, which resulted
in the grain topography being less sharper than that of the uncovered
films.

Figure 3 Topography of the iron films observed in the lubricants. The concentrations
of C18AP were (a) 0 ppm and (b) 200 ppm. Image size, 90 nm2; peak-to-peak amplitude of cantilever oscillation, 2.0 nm; and frequency
shift setpoint, +83 Hz. The cross sections determined along the A–B
and C–D lines are shown in the corresponding lower panels.

Force Mapping
The difference in
the topographic sharpness
seen in Figure 3 suggests
that the C18AP layers were deposited on the iron films. In the presence
of C18AP on the films, the phosphoric acid end should be in contact
with the naturally oxidized iron films, with an expansion of the C18H35 chains into the lubricant liquid. In this
subsection, the mechanical response of the expanding chains is probed
and mapped on the planes that are perpendicular to the iron films
to verify C18AP deposition.

Figure 4 shows the Δf maps
that were observed in the lubricants containing different concentrations
of C18AP. The oscillating cantilever was scanned vertically from the
bulk lubricant to the iron film. The frequency shift as a function
of the vertical coordinate was simultaneously recorded to obtain one
Δf–distance curve composed of 250 pixels
at one lateral position. We aborted the vertical scan when Δf reached a predetermined threshold (+600 Hz for the acquired
maps in Figure 4);
the cantilever was retracted into the lubricant by 10 nm to prevent
extensive tip-to-surface contact. We repeatedly acquired 256 or 512
vertical scans along a 20 nm-long lateral coordinate. One Δf map was subsequently constructed on a plane perpendicular
to the iron film with an acquisition time of 26 (51) s for 256 (512)
scans per frame.

Figure 4 Lubricants over the iron films. The cross-sectional Δf distribution was mapped on a plane that was perpendicular
to the film surface in the lubricants containing C18AP at (a) 0 ppm,
(b) 0.2 ppm, (c) 2 ppm, (d) 20 ppm, and (e) 200 ppm. The amplitude
of the cantilever oscillation was 0.4 nm. The aspect ratio of the
lateral and vertical scales has been tuned unity in the maps. A large
(or small) positive Δf is depicted using a
bright (or dark) blue color. Fourteen Δf–distance
curves situated between the two dashed lines were averaged, with the
results shown in the upper right panel. The averaged Δf–distance curves were converted to force–distance
curves as depicted in the lower right panel.

The observed Δf map can be considered to
be an approximate distribution of the lubricant-induced repulsive
force on the tip. A repulsive force causes a positive Δf, although the relation between the force and Δf is nonlinear.15 A large (small)
value of Δf is denoted by a bright (dark) blue
color in Figure 4,
while areas outside the scanned range are shown in black. The brightest
region at the base of each map represents the boundary between the
lubricant liquid and iron film. The repulsive force on the tip increased
monotonically when it was moved deeper into this region, signifying
tip-to-surface contact. The envelope of the brightest region was corrugated
to trace the topography of the iron films. The lateral and vertical
dimensions of the corrugation were typically 10 and 1–2 nm,
respectively. The corrugations along these dimensions were consistent
with the topographic images shown in Figure 3.

The frequency shift, i.e., the force
on the tip, was uneven in
the vicinity of the iron film. Fourteen Δf–distance
curves were obtained between the two dashed lines and averaged, as
shown in the upper right panel of Figure 4. The zero tip-to-surface distance in the
Δf–distance curve was defined at the
vertical coordinate of the tip where Δf exceeded
the threshold, +600 Hz. The averaged Δf–distance
curve was then converted to a force–distance curve using the
Sader–Jarvis formula15 and is shown
in the lower right panel of Figure 4. The signal-to-noise ratio in the converted curve
showed a force sensitivity on the order of 10 pN in the PAO.

It was technically not easy to average the whole set of Δf curves in the map. The iron film surface, where the tip-to-surface
distance was defined to be zero, was not flat. The vertical scans
were aborted in force mapping when Δf exceeded
the preset threshold. However, the force on the tip was not constant
at the aborted positions since the force is given by a weighed integration
of Δf along the tip trajectory as formulated
by Sader and Jarvis.15 We recognized by
visual inspection that the features in the map were almost homogeneous
along the lateral coordinate even on the corrugated film surface.
On this recognition, averaging a limited number of Δf curves, 14 curves in Figure 4, provided a reasonable way to improve the
statistical reliability of representative curve on the examined interface.

Alternating dark and bright layers appeared in the map (Figure 4a) when we used pure
PAO, suggesting that the film was covered by two or three PAO liquid
layers. The distance between the neighboring maxima in the corresponding
force curve was in the range of 0.6–0.7 nm. The liquid PAO
layers were suggested to be separated by this distance over the iron
film. The liquid-induced force pushing or pulling the tip apex is
attributed to the local liquid density, although the force–density
relation is not straightforward. In a solvent-tip approximation developed
for an ideal tip as small as liquid molecules,16,17 the liquid molecules surrounding the apex generate the force in
the form of local free-energy gradient. With a macroscopic force probe,
which has been used in surface force apparatus, the force on the probe
is simply proportional to the local density of liquid molecules.

Liquid layers separated by 0.6–0.7 nm have been found in
the force maps of organic liquids and assigned to the linear hydrocarbon
chains that lie flat over the solid surface. n-Dodecane
and n-hexadecane liquid in contact to a CH3-terminated thiolate monolayer resulted in liquid layers separated
by 0.56–0.58 nm.18n-Hexadecane exhibited layer-to-layer distances of 0.6 and 0.4–0.6
nm on Cu films13 and graphite wafers,19,20 respectively. Oxygenated chains such as n-decanol,21,22n-dodecanol,23 and tetraglyme
(CH3(OCH2CH2)4OCH3)24 produced liquid layers separated
by 0.5–0.6 nm on graphite. The carbon chain branching of the
PAO used in this study is illustrated in Figure 1. The branched chain showed a layer-to-layer
distance (0.6–0.7 nm) that was slightly larger than that observed
in the linear-chain compounds mentioned above (0.4–0.6 nm).
This result is not surprising as a heavily branched hydrocarbon such
as 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane (squalane) has previously
produced liquid layers separated by 0.6 nm on graphite.25 A recent AFM study26 reported averaged layer distances of 0.42 and 0.47 nm in a larger
PAO, decene tetramers, on graphite and steal, respectively.

The layered force distribution weakened and in cases even disappeared
when C18AP was added to PAO. The PAO layers intermittently remained
in the map (Figure 4b) at a C18AP concentration of 0.2 ppm, while the layered feature
almost disappeared in the map (Figure 4c) at a concentration of 2 ppm. The repulsive force
on the tip monotonically decayed with the increase in tip-to-surface
distance in the areas where the layered feature disappeared. Here,
the laterally heterogeneous layers of the lubricant modifier were
visualized on a nanometer-scale resolution in space. The layered structure
was completely removed by adding C18AP at concentrations of 20 and
200 ppm, as shown in the maps in Figure 4d,e.

The monotonically decaying force
component increased with an increase
in C18AP concentration. The decay length, which was defined as the
tip-to-surface distance resulting in zero force, was estimated to
be 0.6, 0.9, and 2.0 nm, corresponding to C18AP concentrations of
0.2, 2, and 20 ppm, respectively. A further increase in the concentration
to 200 pm caused little extension in the decay length. This resulted
in the two force curves at 20 and 200 ppm being identical. The identical
force curves were a reflection of the C18AP layer that fully covered
the iron films. Here, we assume that the acid esters were anchored
at the phosphoric acid end on the naturally oxidized iron films. Each
adsorbed C18AP contains one or two C18H35 chains
that extend into the lubricant liquid. The chains could not be as
closely packed like the alkyl chains of alkylthiolates on a gold film
because the C18AP used in this study was a mixture of the monoester
and diester. The loosely packed chains have to be flexible and fluctuating
in the lubricant. The force on the tip was fluctuating when it was
in contact with a fluctuating chain. The accumulation time at each
vertical coordinate was typically 30 μs in our force mapping
scans. Hence, the observed Δf represented the
time-averaged force on the tip and in turn reflected the time-averaged
density distribution of the fluctuating chains. The observed curves
decayed to zero force at a tip-to-surface distance of 2.0 nm at high
C18AP concentrations. This distance is consistent with the C18H35 chain length depicted in Figure 1, wherein the two terminal carbon atoms are
separated by 1.9 nm. The observed length saturated at 2.0 nm, which
suggests that there was a monomolecular C18AP layer on the iron films.
The undersaturated layers generated at 0.2 and 2 ppm exhibited short
decay lengths. The C18H35 chains in the unsaturated
layers can be tilted to enable contact with the film to gain van der
Waals energy. The tilted chains presented thin layers.

The alkyl
chains in the alkylthiolate monolayers prepared on a
gold film were closely packed to solidify the monolayers. The solidified
monolayer created a static boundary with the organic solvents that
could be traced during topographic imaging with FM-AFM.18 We assume that the C18AP layers on the iron
films were not solidified. Force mapping facilitated the quantification
of the vertical and lateral distributions of the C18AP layers having
a fluctuating, dynamic boundary with the liquid PAO. Fukuma and co-workers
demonstrated the feasibility of AFM-based force mapping for estimating
the time-averaged density distribution of the lipid head groups27 and biofouling-resistant moieties28 in water. Hirayama et al.13 extended their method to include a hexadecane-based model
lubricant that is more viscous than water. Moustafa et al.29 conducted a bimodal AFM study to visualize the
lateral distribution of weakly adsorbed organic aggregates over graphite
surfaces. A recent mapping study on a liquid ester lubricant with
no modifier30 reported the deposition of
soft layers on a diamondlike carbon film following rubbing in a friction
test, which was most likely a result of the tribochemical reactions
of the lubricant. Our present study provided the lateral and vertical
distributions of the ester modifiers in the poly-α-olefin liquid.
The relation between the observed distribution of the modifier and
the macroscopic friction property is examined in the final section
of this paper.

Force mapping in the lubricants was further examined
using graphite
wafers to support the interpretation of the C18AP layer deposition
on the iron films. Graphite was considered to have little chemical
affinity to the phosphoric acid ester. Figure 5 shows the Δf maps
that were observed in the absence and presence of C18AP. The freshly
cleaved graphite wafer showed atomically flat terraces in the topographic
images (not shown). The map (Figure 5a) captured in pure PAO shows that the envelope of
the brightest colored region, which represents the physical topography
of the wafer, was straight as expected. Three liquid layers appeared
with layer-to-layer distances of 0.6–0.7 nm. The layered PAO
liquid was seen both on the graphite and iron films. Figure 5b shows the Δf map acquired in the presence of C18AP at 200 ppm. Three
bright layers parallel to the graphite surface were still identifiable,
indicating that the lubricant liquid was directly exposed to the graphite.
The force mapping results shown in Figures 4 and 5 support our
interpretation that the iron film was partially or fully covered by
the C18AP layers depending on the concentration of C18AP in the bulk
lubricant.

Figure 5 Lubricants over graphite. The Δf maps were
obtained for the lubricants with C18AP concentrations of (a) 0 ppm
and (b) 200 ppm. Fourteen Δf–distance
curves situated between the two dashed lines were averaged, with the
results shown in the upper right panel. The averaged Δf–distance curves were converted to force–distance
curves, as depicted in the lower right panel. The cantilever oscillation
amplitude: (a) 0.6 nm and (b) 0.4 nm.

In addition to the layered feature, a monotonically decaying force
was to a limited extent identified in the C18AP-containing lubricant.
The decay length was estimated to be ca. 2 nm, although overlapped
with the oscillatory force. A limited amount of C18AP might have been
adsorbed on the graphite surface and/or the probing tip apex to produce
the monotonically decaying force overlapping the oscillatory force
coming from PAO layers. Comparing ordinary silicon tips with tips
coated or made of carbonaceous materials would help us to interpret
the monotonically decaying force recognized on graphite.

Friction Test
Method
The dynamic friction coefficient
at the sliding steel–lubricant–steel interfaces was
evaluated using a pendulum-type friction tester (Narita Seiki Inc.).31 A steel pendulum was freely oscillated with
the fulcrum dipped in the lubricant (see the table of contents graphic).
One oscillation was typically completed in 4 s. The amplitude of the
pendulum oscillation was dampened because of the lubricated friction
on the fulcrum. The initial amplitude (A0) was set at 0.5 rad, and the decayed amplitude (Ak) was recorded on the basis of the number of completed oscillations
(k) until Ak ≤
0.1. The friction coefficient (μ), which was averaged over one
measurement ranging from A0 to An, can be expressed by the following equation  where n is the number of
recorded oscillations in each measurement run. Using our tester, we
calibrated the constant C to 3.2 according to the
pendulum length and weight of the fulcrum. The friction coefficient
increased with repeated oscillation cycles. Hence, a maximum of 20
measurement runs were conducted to trace the time course of the coefficient.

Friction Coefficient at Different Modifier Concentrations
Figure 6 shows the
evaluated coefficients in the lubricants containing C18AP concentrations
of 0, 2, 20, and 200 ppm. The raw amplitudes (Ak) recorded in the individual runs are reported in the Supporting Information. The coefficient for pure
PAO was 0.11 in run 1, rapidly increased to 0.34 in runs 4–13,
and continued to increase up to 0.40 in runs 14–20. The friction
increased with the sliding cycles in the modifier-free PAO, which
resulted in the adhesion of the sliding steel surfaces. The coefficient
for a C18AP concentration of 2 ppm similarly increased in runs 1–13
and subsequently remained constant between 0.33 and 0.34 in runs 14–20.
The limited amount of C18AP caused a noticeable change in the friction
at the sliding interface. The friction further decreased when the
C18AP concentration was increased to 20 ppm. The initial coefficient
(0.12) was constant until run 5, increased in runs 6–17, and
remained almost constant between 0.26 and 0.28 in runs 18–20.
The addition of C18AP at 200 ppm, which was the highest concentration
investigated, stabilized the coefficient between 0.11 and 0.10 in
runs 1–10. The stable, low friction that was observed at this
concentration is a characteristic of the lubricants that have been
successfully modified with polar compounds.

Figure 6 Friction coefficient
of the steel–lubricant–steel
interfaces that were evaluated using a pendulum-type friction tester.
Lubricants containing C18AP concentrations of 0, 2, 20, and 200 ppm
were tested.

Compare the friction results with
the nanometer-scale force mapping
results described in the previous section. In the absence of the modifier,
layered PAO liquid was present on the iron film. The steal surfaces
sliding in the fulcrum should also have been exposed to PAO and hence
adhered. The time course of the friction coefficient was modified
partially at a lower concentration (2 ppm), at which concentration
the layered PAO feature almost disappeared in the force map on the
film. The force map at 20 ppm showed a full coverage of the C18AP
monolayer on the film. The macroscopic friction continued to decrease
in the lubricant with this modifier concentration. The force map was
insensitive to further addition of C18AP, while the friction coefficient
still descended at 200 ppm.

We infer that the friction and force
map results are qualitatively
related, even though one was observed at the sliding steel–lubricant–steel
interface and the other at the static lubricant–iron boundary.
A C18AP monolayer that completely covers the surface of a solid in
a static environment is a requirement for the modification of the
friction property in the sliding condition. The excess modifier in
the bulk lubricant may have additionally contribute to produce phosphorus-containing
tribolayers on the sliding fulcrum interface, leading to the stable
low friction achieved at 200 pm.

Our approach that proposes
force mapping with FM-AFM provides a
unique opportunity for characterizing modifier-containing lubricants.
The presence of PAO-induced layers indicates that the solid surface
under investigation was directly exposed to the lubricant. The surface
was covered with flexible moieties of the modifier fluctuating in
the lubricant liquid when the force on the probing tip monotonically
decayed as a function of the tip-to-surface distance. The vertical
distribution of the monotonically decaying force was a reflection
of the thickness of the modifier layer deposited on the surface. The
dynamic friction coefficient at the real sliding interfaces having
macroscopic dimensions responded to the nanometer-scale distribution
of the modifier layer when mechanically probed by the AFM tip.

One potential advantage of the AFM-based method for modifier characterization
is the nanometer-scale resolution of the lateral coordinates over
the solid surface. The other methods mentioned in the Introduction section provide the mass, chemical structure,
or layer thickness of the deposited modifier averaged over a millimeter-sized
lubricant–solid interface. Real modifier layers can be heterogeneous,
particularly in the presence of two or more modifiers. Rubbing the
layers may induce further heterogeneity. AFM-based force mapping is
a standalone technique for locally characterizing the lubricant modifiers
in the buried interfaces.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated the feasibility of using FM-AFM for mechanically
probing a lubricant–solid interface, C18AP-containing PAO covering
the iron films. We mapped the lubricant-induced force on the probing
tip two-dimensionally on a plane that was perpendicular to the lubricant–iron
interface and thus achieved a force sensitivity and spatial resolution
on the order of 10 pN and 10 pm, respectively. We propose the following
conclusions after interpretation of the observed force maps. The PAO
was directly exposed to the naturally oxidized iron film in the absence
of the C18AP modifier, and it exhibited a few liquid layers parallel
to the film surface with a layer-to-layer distance of 0.6–0.7
nm. C18AP, if any in the lubricant, was adsorbed with its phosphoric
acid end anchored to the films. There was fluctuation of the C18H35 chains of C18AP in the lubricant. The force
maps reflected the time-averaged density distribution of the fluctuating
chains, which monotonically decayed to zero force at a tip-to-surface
distance of 2 nm when a monomolecular layer of C18AP was completed.
The PAO liquid layers were intermittently removed in the lubricants
containing C18AP concentrations of 0.2 and 2 ppm; they completely
disappeared at 20 and 200 ppm. The iron film that was completely covered
with the C18AP layer produced topographic images with reduced sharpness
according to its fluctuating, dynamic boundary with the lubricant.
The dynamic friction coefficient of the sliding steel–lubricant–steel
interfaces, which was separately determined using the friction tester,
decreased with increasing the coverage of the monomolecular C18AP
on the iron film. The mechanical probing with FM-AFM combined with
friction test offers a promising technique for bridging nanometer-scale
lubricant distribution and sliding friction in the macroscopic dimensions.
