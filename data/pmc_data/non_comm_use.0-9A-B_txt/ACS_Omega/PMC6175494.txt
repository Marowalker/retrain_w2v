An ionic liquid-based surfactant
with ester functionality self-aggregates
in an aqueous medium and forms ionogels at 8.80% (w/v) concentration
at physiological pH. The ionogel exhibited a remarkable change in
its appearance with temperature from fibrillar opaque to transparent
because of the dynamic changes within its supramolecular structure.
This gel-to-gel phase transition occurs below the melting point of
the solid ionic liquid. The ionogels were investigated using turbidity,
differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
field emission SEM (FE-SEM), inverted microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy imaging, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and rheological
measurements. The fibrillar opaque ionogel and transparent ionogel
were studied for their ability to absorb dyes (methyl orange and crystal
violet) and to encapsulate drugs (diclofenac sodium and imatinib mesylate).

1 Introduction
Hydrogels
are water-swelled three-dimensional (3D) networks that
exhibit extraordinary performance in various aspects, such as excellent
biocompatibility, tunable mechanical strength, and multistimuli response
to name a few.1−4 Stimuli-responsive hydrogels are those which respond to various
stimuli such as pH of the solution,5−8 solvent,9 ionic
strength,10−12 temperature,13−15 and light16−18 by an abrupt
change in volume, accompanied by the intake or release of a large
amount of water. Some amphiphilic molecules, for example, surfactants
and hydrophilic copolymers, self-assemble in aqueous solutions with
a large aspect ratio, leading to the formation of a 3D branched network.
One of the prime requirements for the 3D network is to have multiple
binding sites, which serves as the junction for the cross-linking,
as reported in the case of the pillar[5]arene derivative with 10 hydrazide
groups reacting with bis(p-formylphenyl)sebacate
to form organogels, whose mechanical properties can be easily tuned
by controlling the molar ratio of the components of the mixture.19 The 3D network may produce a physical hydrogel,
the so-called “supramolecular structural entity” composed
of fibrous aggregates connected through the noncovalent interactions,
for example, hydrogen bonds,20−25 π–π interactions,26−28 lipophilic interactions,28,29 host–guest interactions,30 and
dipole–dipole and donor–acceptor interactions.31,32 Recently, a novel supramolecular fluorescent hydrogel with ATP/ATPase
responsiveness was synthesized through the electrostatic interaction
between poly(sodium p-styrene sulfonate) and tetraphenylethene
derivatives with two quaternary ammonium cations.33 These assemblies found applications in tissue engineering,34 drug delivery,35 optical
field,36 as injectable gels,37,38 cell scaffolds,39−41 self-healing materials,42−44 and biosensors45 to cite a few.

Among the various classes
of hydrogels, thermo-responsive hydrogels46−48 that are triggered
by changing the gel temperature represent one
of the most successful examples of these smart systems.49 The mechanism responsible for gelation upon
cooling is the formation of physical cross-links that denature at
high temperatures.50,51 In the case of heating, temperature-induced
hydrogelation is due to dehydration of the hydrophobic moieties of
the amphiphiles,49,52,53 leading to the formation of 3D network gels.52 The thermo-induced gel-to-gel transition in low-molecular-weight
gelators (LMWGs) is limited to few cases.54−56 Xie et al.
reported a unique thermo-induced crystalline gel-to-transparent gel
transition in a pH-sensitive LMWG.54 Meister
et al.55 reported a temperature-induced
gel-to-gel transition for bolaamphiphiles when the alkyl chain length
exceeded 26 carbon atoms. Both the gel phases of the bolaamphiphiles
were composites of fibers. Hard-to-soft organogel transitions from
a discotic columnar to a plastic crystal to a crystalline phase were
exhibited recently where the soft organogel only existed at a low
temperature range (<5 °C).56 Yan
et al. designed metallohydrogels through the self-assembly of functionalized
dicarboxylate ligands through intermolecular hydrophobic and π–π
interactions that have potential as the functionalized soft materials.28

The gelation ability and hence the applications
can be customized
by changing the structures of the amphiphilic LMWGs.57,58 In this process, a new class of amphiphiles, ionic liquids (ILs)-based
surfactants (ILBSs), are receiving increased attention. The inclusion
of a functionality in the side chain of ILBSs allows the formation
of ILBSs with tailor-made properties. For example, substituting a
methyl group in 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ILBSs by a −CH2COOH group increased the surface activity.57 Recently, we have investigated the surface active properties
of the vinyl-functionalized imidazolium-based ILs and found that they
possess better surface activity than the nonfunctionalized ILs.58 Various surfactants were further tested in our
laboratory for their ability to form various microstructural aggregates
in the presence of solubilizates, including drugs.59−62 Apart from the surface activity,
the “green” credentials of ILBSs can be enhanced by
introducing the functionality within the side chain. By introducing
the ether or polyether side chain in imidazolium-based ILs, Morrissey
et al. observed a clear reduction in their toxicity.63 Further, the surface and biological activity of the imidazolium-
and pyridinium-based ILs are improved significantly by introducing
the ester functionality within the IL structure.64 Introducing the cleavable ester functional group in the
side chain significantly increased the biodegradability of the ILs
as compared to the nonfunctionalized ILs. Such ester-functionalized
ILBSs can be used as the LMWGs for various applications including
drug delivery as of other biodegradable LMWGs.

Considering the
above-mentioned favorable characteristics of ILBSs
with ester functionality, we synthesized the ILBS 3-methyl-1-(hexadecyloxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium
bromide (C16EMeImBr) and studied its self-assembly
behavior in the aqueous medium. Among the halide counterions, the
Br– anion possesses higher adsorption abilities
as it adopts vertical orientation at the air–water interface
as compared to the Cl– and I– anions.65,66 C12EMeImBr and C14EMeImBr form gels at 25.20 and 22.60% w/v, respectively and hence
were not further investigated. We found that C16EMeImBr forms supramolecular ionic hydrogels in the aqueous
medium at physiological pH at 8.80% w/v. An unusual, unprecedented
reversible transition from the supramolecular fibrillary opaque ionic
hydrogel into the supramolecular transparent ionic hydrogel was observed
upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 50 °C. This gel-to-gel
transition is due to the balance between gelator–gelator and
gelator–water interactions. The morphology associated with
the opaque fibrillar at 25 °C temperatures was studied using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission SEM (FE-SEM), inverted
microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. The
gel-to-gel transition was characterized by turbidity, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy. The dynamic mechanical analysis was assessed using rheological
measurements. The temperature and dilution stability of the gels were
also studied. Finally, the opaque and transparent ionogels were tested
for their absorbing capacity of water-soluble dyes and drugs. The
present work is a contribution to the use of functionalized, biodegradable
ILBSs as LMWGs Scheme 1.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Dependence of ILBS Aggregation
in the Aqueous
Medium on the Length of the Alkyl Chain and Effects of the Ester-Containing
Side Chain
Figure 1 shows the dependence of the surface tension (γ) on
surfactant concentration for CnEMeImBr
at 25 °C, n = C12, C14, and C16. The corresponding
critical micelle concentrations (cmcs) are reported in Table 1. The values for the C12 and C14 members agree with
literature values, and the value for C16EMeImBr
is reported for the first time. As expected, the value of cmc decreases
as a function of the increasing length of the alkyl chain. Thus, the
relative cmc values of these surfactants are 13.8:5: 1 for n = C12, C14, and C16, respectively. For the ILBSs with
the morpholinium head group containing ester functionality in the
side chain, the relative cmc decreases from 11.07 to 1 by moving from
C12 to C16.67 Note that the cmc of the ester-functionalized
ILBS is lower than that of the nonfunctionalized (CnMeImBr), vinyl-functionalized (CnVnImBr), and conventional cationic surfactants (CnTABr).68,69 This may be due to hydration
of the ester group that contributes to head-group repulsion at the
micellar–water interface. Additionally, the ester group is
localized close to the imidazolium ring, and this may favor electrostatic
and H-bonding interactions among the alkyl chains of the ILBSs, favoring
the aggregation at lower surfactant concentration. The surface activity
of the ester-functionalized ILBSs is the result of the above factors
and is discussed below in detail.

a The uncertainties in the calculated
parameters are given as follows: γcmc = ±0.1
mN/m; πcmc = ±0.1 mN/m; Γmax = ±0.2 × 10–6 mol/m2; Amin = 0.5 Å2.

In addition to the values of cmc
reported in Table 1, we discuss other parameters calculated
from the plots of Figure 1. The discussion is based on the effect of (i) the alkyl chain
length and (ii) presence of the ester group on the interfacial and
micellar properties. Among the parameters calculated, surface tension
at cmc (γcmc) decreases with an increase in the alkyl
chain length of the ILBS. The values of γcmc for
CnEMeImBr are lower than those for CnVnImBr, CnMeImBr,
and CnTABr with an analogous alkyl chain,
showing that introducing the ester functionality increases the surface
activity of the ILBSs relative to the vinyl-functionalized and nonfunctionalized
ILBSs and conventional cationic surfactants. That is, introducing
the functionality increases the efficiency of the ILs to reduce the
surface tension of water. Increasing the alkyl chain length increases
the adsorption efficiency (pC20) and surface pressure at the cmc (πcmc), suggesting that the adsorption efficiency of the ILBSs
increases because of the increased hydrophobic interactions. The values
of pC20 and πcmc are in the order: CnEMeImBr > CnVnImBr
>
CnMeImBr > CnTABr. Similar to the nonfunctionalized ILBSs and conventional
surfactants,
the maximum surface excess concentration, Γmax, increases
with the alkyl chain length, Cn, because
of the increased hydrophobic interactions and tight packing among
the monomers in the micelles.70 The higher
values of Γmax for the ester-functionalized ILBSs
are larger than those of CnMeImBr and
CnVnImBr as well as than those of the
conventional cationic surfactants with an analogous alkyl chain length.
These results indicate that ester-functionalized ILBSs accumulate
more at the air–water interface than others.

Applications
of these ester-functionalized ILBSs require knowledge
of the geometry and size of their aggregates. We employed the well-known
Israelachvilís ratio to predict the shape of the aggregates.
Combining the experimentally determined values of Amin through surface tension data and using the Tanford
formula,70 we calculated the values for
the packing parameter (P). For all three ILBSs with
ester functionalization, the values of P were found
to be less than 0.33, indicating that the aggregates of all ILBSs
were spherical in shape near their cmc.

2.2 Formation
of Ionogels with the Thermo-Induced
Gel-to-Gel Transition
The spherically shaped ILBS micelles
close to their cmc form isotropic solution in water. Upon increasing
the concentration of C12EmeImBr, C14EmeImBr, and C16EmeImBr beyond
their cmc, the solutions go through the phase transition from isotropic
to turbid because of the increased size of the aggregates. The ester-functionalized
IL forms ionic hydrogels in an aqueous medium at physiological pH
(i.e., pH 7.4) at higher concentrations. Experimentally, the solid
CnEMeImBr was weighed and mixed with 10
mL of water in a glass tube with the screw cap, and the mixture was
heated in the water bath at 60 °C to yield a transparent solution.
The latter was allowed to cool to room temperature using a specific
cooling procedure [see scheme (a) of Figure 2]. The formation of the fibrillar opaque
ionic hydrogel, hereafter termed as ionogel, was observed visually.
The critical concentration for gelation (CCG) was found to be 25.20,
22.60, and 8.80% (w/v) for C12EmeImBr, C14EmeImBr, and C16EmeImBr,
respectively. Below CCG, only a viscous gel or loose gel was observed.
As C16EmeImBr forms ionogels at much lower
concentration than the other two ILBSs, we concentrated our studies
on C16EmeImBr. In the range of 8.80–10.40%
(w/v) and at pH 7.4, a fibrillar opaque ionogel was observed at 25
°C for C16EmeImBr, as shown in part (b)
of Figure 2. Beyond
10.40% (w/v), precipitation occurs. The opaque gel showed good swelling
and adhesive property, as shown in part (b,c) of Figure 2. Therefore, we carried out
further gelation studies at 9.60% (w/v) and at pH 7.4 in the aqueous
medium.

of the water-swollen gel at 25 °C and (d) turbidity measurement
of the ionogel as a function of temperature.

To assess whether the transition (fibrillary opaque →
transparent
gel) is a kinetic process or thermodynamic one, we employed different
protocols for C16EMeImBr solution cooling
(9.60% w/v, pH = 7.4, and 60 → 25 °C): (1) fast cooling
(ca. 4 min) by placing the hot surfactant solution in a constant-temperature
water bath (25 °C) and (2) slow cooling by turning off the heat,
thus allowing the system (C16EMeImBr solution
+ water bath) to reach 25 °C (ca. 45 min). In both cases, fast
and slow cooling, the solution produced a fibrillar opaque gel on
cooling, as shown in Figure 2a. Consequently, the gelation of C16EMeImBr is thermodynamically controlled; the entrapped water molecules
between the hydrophobic alkyl side chains interact with the ester
group, forming a fibrillar opaque ionic hydrogel.71 For a dipeptide-based supramolecular gelator, a transparent
gel was observed on fast cooling and a viscous turbid solution appeared
upon slow cooling.72

The observed
gel-to-gel transition (opaque to transparent) upon
increasing the temperature from 25 to 50 °C was characterized
using turbidity and DSC. As shown in Figure 2d, with an increase in the temperature, %
transmittance of the ionogel increases. A sharp increase was observed
between 42.5 and 48.5 °C, after which the value of % transmittance
remained practically constant. The transition in the transmittance
agrees with the opaque (25 °C) → transparent above 48.5
°C.

Turbidity data were further supported by the DSC thermogram.
As
observed in Figure 3, the temperature-induced gel-to-gel transition was observed at 46.6
°C (Tgel–gel) with one additional
small endothermic peak at 71.5 °C, attributed to the melting
point of solid C16EMeImBr. The lower transition
temperature than the melting temperature suggests that the gel-to-gel
transition occurred below the melting point of C16EMeImBr,54 probably because of the
disruption of the cross-linked fibrous network of the fibrillar opaque
gel (vide infra FE-SEM results) to form the transparent gel at higher
temperature.55

C16EMeImBr and
the opaque ionogel.

2.3 Gel Particle
Morphology
We further
probed the gel particle morphology by SEM, FE-SEM, inverted microscopy,
and TEM. The SEM image (Figure 4a) revealed the formation of a 3D branched network composed
of long entangled fibers. Here, the 3D filaments are made of tightly
winded helical tubules. The gel is expected to be formed by encapsulating
the water molecules within the network of the percolated gelator and
inside the branched tubes.73,74 The FE-SEM image (Figure 4b) showed an entangled
3D fibrillary network responsible for the gelation. The entangled
thin fibers are 1 μm in width and several micrometers in length.75,76 The gel contained a tubular-like structure, as observed in TEM images
(Figure 4c).77 The excellent quality of the micrographs shown
in parts (a,b) of Figure 4 indicates that the physical integrity of the gel was not
disturbed by the drying step during sample preparation.

Figure 4 Morphology
of the gel as revealed by SEM, part (a); FE-SEM, part
(b); TEM, part (c); and inverted microscopy, part (d). All images
were recorded at 25 °C.

The texture of the hydrogel was also studied using an inverted
microscope. The fibrillar network can be observed (Figure 4d), confirming the formation
of uniaxial structures in the hydrogel. Thus, the opaque hydrogel
structure at 25 °C is made up of the tubes, which on interdigitating
formed the 3D branched network.78

2.4 Mechanical Properties of the Ionogels
The mechanical
properties of the fibrillar opaque and transparent
supramolecular ionogel were studied using the angular frequency sweep
and strain sweep dynamic rheology test. To determine the linear viscoelastic
region for both gels, we performed the angular frequency sweep test
up to the maximum frequency of 100 rad s–1. The
elastic modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were plotted as a function of oscillation frequency,
and the results are shown in Figure 5a. At 5% fixed strain, for opaque and transparent gels,
the storage modulus (G′) was higher than the
loss modulus (G″) with increasing angular
frequency (0–100 rad s–1). Furthermore, the
values of G′ in the opaque gel were higher
than the transparent gel, indicating branching of the former, which
provides additional paths for the storage of energy. The loss modulus
(G″)—indicative of how energy is dissipated
in the system—showed a behavior similar to G′ for both types of gels. At the investigated angular frequency
range, no cross-over frequency (ωc) was observed,
indicating that the colloidal particles are unstable or form a 3D
branched network.

Figure 5 (a) Frequency sweep dynamic rheology data for the hydrogel
(9.60%)
at 25 and 50 °C (strain 5%). (b,c) Strain sweep dynamic rheological
data for the hydrogel (9.6%) at (b) 25 and (c) 50 °C. The angular
frequency is ω = 1 rad s–1).

The strain sweep test at the fixed angular frequency
of 1 rad s–1 for both the opaque and transparent
gels was carried
out to characterize the mechanical properties of the fibrillar opaque
and transparent ionogel. For the former, the values of (G′) and (G″) remain constant up to
5% strain, indicating that the gel is in the linear viscoelastic region
in which the elasticity and viscosity are constant. Beyond 5% strain, G′ and G″ decrease rapidly,
and the cross-over occurred at 9.5% strain (Figure 5b). This point is also known as the critical
strain level (γc). γc is the characteristic
boundary of the structured gel, below which the gel exhibits a viscoelastic
character that hinders its flow. Above γc, the storage
modulus starts decreasing because of the breaking up of the structured
(fibrillar) network. The above results indicate that the opaque gel
formed a stable continuous elastic network up to 5% strain.79,80 For the transparent gel, G′ is higher than G″, and no cross-over is observed up to 100% strain
sweep (Figure 5c),
indicating the formation of a true gel in the entire strain sweep
region.81 Consequently, the hydrogel at
50 °C consists of an entangled temporally persistent network
formed as a result of interactions because of topological constraints.54

2.5 Water–Surfactant
Interactions in the
Gels
To understand the water–surfactant interactions
during gel-to-gel transition, we recorded the FT-IR spectra of the
partially dried ionogel samples. As observed in Table 2, the −OH stretching frequency of
water in the transparent gel is red-shifted from 3632 to 3529 cm–1 in the opaque gel because of stronger hydrogen bonding
in the latter case.82 The values of ν–C=O of the ester group, which is at 1749 cm–1 for the powder sample, are 1688 cm–1 for the opaque gel and 1708 cm–1 for the transparent
counterpart. That is, the ester group is likely to be more hydrated
in the gel that is formed at lower temperature (opaque gel).83 The C–N stretching vibration in the cationic
ring, which is located at −1575 cm–1 in powder
C16EMeImBr, is shifted to −1530 and
−1540 cm–1 for the fibrillar opaque gel and
the transparent ionic hydrogel gel, respectively. Thus, the hydrogen
bonding plays a dominant role for the formation of the fibrillar opaque
gel network at 25 °C, which got weaker at higher temperature,
that is, at 50 °C forming the transparent gel. Increase in solubility
of the ester group containing the hydrophobic alkyl chain at higher
temperature also affects the physical appearance of the gel. Overall,
for the transition of transparent ionogel → opaque ionogel, νOH, νC=O, and νC–N show a red shift, indicating stronger H-bonding.

2.6 Stability
of the Ionogel with Respect to pH
and Dilution
In order to utilize the opaque gel for various
applications, it is important to evaluate its stability on dilution
and toward pH changes. We performed the pH stability of the opaque
gel in phosphate buffer pH (pH 5.0 and 7.4). After 12 days of incubation
time (25 °C), no detectable gel was found at acidic pH versus
20% residual gel at 7.4 pH buffer solution. The degradation of the
ionogel is due the presence of the ester group (β) to the quaternized
nitrogen atom, which facilitates ester hydrolysis by its (−I)
effect (Figure 6).84

Figure 6 Degradation profile of the ionic hydrogel in two buffer
solutions
of pH 5.0 and 7.4 at room temperature.

Both ionogels were subjected to 100% volume dilution with
water
at 25 °C (opaque) and 50 °C (transparent) and were found
to remain intact (see Figure 7).

Figure 7 Dilution and temperature stability study.

2.7 Application of the Ionogel in Dye Absorption
and Drug Encapsulation
Water pollution by (textile) dyes
that are stable to thermal and light degradation is a major concern.
Several gels were extensively explored as biosorbent for the removal
of these dyes from the solution.85−87 The characteristic feature
of the crystalline-layered structures of the gels is responsible for
the intercalation of the guest molecules.88 We explored the ability of the opaque and transparent gels to absorb
representative dye contaminants (methyl orange, MO, and crystal violet,
CV) from the aqueous medium.

A preliminary study indicates that
the opaque ionogel very effectively absorbs MO and CV (see entries
1 and 2 of Table 3).
MO and CV are absorbed by 73.1 and 34.0% w/w, respectively (Figure S4a,b). The fibrillary ionogel absorbs
9.15 mg of MO per gram of the ionogel and 2.12 mg of CV per gram of
the ionogel. The host–guest type of interactions and the electrostatic
interactions are certainly responsible for the specific absorption
of the anionic dyes rather than the cationic dyes in the opaque gel.89 The absorption values of the present investigation
are substantially higher than that of the tri-peptide-based gel but
lower than that of the Ag(I)–melamine-based gel.89,90 The ease of preparation as well as the ability to tune the properties
of the ILBSs by merely changing the constituting cations and/or anions
put these LMWGs ahead of the polymeric gels.

As reported in entry nos 1 and 2 of Table 4, the transparent
gel absorbs only 34.0 and
8.0% w/w of MO and CV, respectively (Figure S5a,b). The transparent gel absorbs 4.25 mg of MO per gram of the ionogel
and 0.50 mg of CV per gram of the ionogel.

Similarly, the encapsulation efficiency of the opaque
and transparent
gels was investigated for the two drugs, sodium salt of diclofenac
(DS) and imatinibmesylate (IM). As reported in entry nos 3 and 4 of Table 3, the opaque crystalline
gel encapsulates only 40.4% of DS, whereas 72.3% of IM was encapsulated
(Figure S6). The transparent gel encapsulates
only 1.4% of DS, whereas 53.59% of IM was encapsulated. The drug encapsulation
efficiency for the opaque gel is calculated by measuring the absorbance
of the drug through UV–vis data and is found to be 15.22 and
27.62 mg per gram of the ionic hydrogel molecule for DS and IM, respectively.
For the transparent ionogel, 0.52 and 17.75 mg of DS and IM, respectively,
were encapsulated per gram of the ionic hydrogel. Although both drugs
are anionic, the latter is more hydrophobic (log P = 4.26 and 4.38), hence it is encapsulated more on the gel by hydrophobic
interactions. The schematic representation of the absorption of dyes
and drugs in the ionogel is given in Figure 8.

3 Conclusions
Ester-functionalized ILBSs exhibited better surface-active properties
than the nonfunctionalized and vinyl-functionalized ILBSs as well
as than the conventional surfactants. These surface-active ILBSs form
gels in water at higher concentration. Among the three ILBSs studied,
C16EMeImBr forms a gel in water with 8.80%
w/v of CCG. The addition of C16EMeImBr in
an aqueous solution forms a unique gel-to-gel reversible transition
with change in temperature: opaque at 25 °C and transparent at
50 °C. The transformation occurs below the melting point of the
ILBS and is confirmed by turbidity and DSC measurements. The morphology
of the gel at 25 °C temperature is further characterized through
SEM, FE-SEM, inverted microscopy, and TEM imaging. The encapsulation
of water among the 3D network of lamellar arrangement provides a microenvironment
for the encapsulation of the hydrophobic moieties in protected manners.
At high temperature, the fibrillar gel consisted of an entangled temporally
persistent network is transformed into the transparent gel and is
characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The mechanical properties of
the ionogels were investigated by strain sweep and frequency sweep
rheology measurements. The fibrillar gel exhibited excellent dye-absorbing
and drug-encapsulating properties. The results show some potential
applications of LMWGs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
2-Bromoacetic acid (LOBA
Chemie ≥98.0%), hexadecan-1-ol (SDFCL, 95.0%), toluene-4-sulfonic
acid hydrate (LOBA Chemie ≥98.0%), 1-methylimidazole (Spectrochem
≥99.0%), IM (Sigma-Aldrich ≥98.0%), DS (Sigma-Aldrich
≥98.5%), MO (Acros, 95%)), and CV (Sigma-Aldrich ≥90.0%)
were used without further purification. Other chemicals were of analytical
grade, and water was triply distilled.

4.2 Synthesis
of Ester-Functionalized ILBSs
Ester-functionalized IL C16EMeImBr (molecular
formula C22H41BrN2O2 and
molecular weight 445.48 g/mol) was synthesized in a two-step procedure.
Other two ILBSs of the series were synthesized by the same method
except for the length of alkyl bromides, dodecyl, and tetradecyl.
In the first step, hexadecyl-2-bromoacetate was synthesized by the
procedure reported elsewhere.91 Briefly,
in the first step, hexadecyl-2-bromoacetate was synthesized by mixing
cetyl alcohol (2.43 g, 10 mmol) and bromoacetic acid (12 mmol, 8.63
mL) at a volume ratio of 1:1.2. In the mixture, p-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate (10%, 1 mmol, 192 mg) was added
as the catalyst, and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C
in the magnetic stirrer for 4 h. The completion of the reaction was
monitored through thin-layer chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl
acetate, 9:1). The reaction mass was dissolved in CHCl3 and then washed with 100 mL of water (10 mL aliquots). The product
was phase-separated, and the reaction mass was transferred to a rotary
evaporator to remove the solvents and water at 40 °C. Then, the
crude product was washed with warm aqueous methanol (methanol/water,
98:2) at room temperature. The phase-separated product (lower layer)
was again taken in a rotary evaporator to remove excess methanol and
water.

In the second step, hexadecyl-2-bromoacetate (3.63 g,
10 mmol) was reacted with N-methyl imidazole (0.80
g, 10 mmol) at 90 °C for 2–3 h. After cooling to room
temperature, the product was repeatedly washed with diethyl ether
and then precipitated in cold acetone. The white solid product was
separated using a separating funnel, and the product was dried under
a vacuum dryer at 50 °C overnight (yield 76.35%, mp 71.5 °C).

4.3 Methods
4.3.1 Surface
Tension Measurements
Surface
tension of the ILBSs solution was determined using a K9 tensiometer
(Krüss) with a platinum–iridium ring at 25.0 ±
0.1 °C. The instrument was calibrated using triple-distilled
water.

4.3.2 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
The
thermal stability of the representative C16EMeImBr ILBS was determined using an SDT Q600 instrument between
the temperature range of 25 and 500 °C at a heating rate of 10
°C/min in a N2 atmosphere. The start temperature (Tstart) is the temperature at which the decomposition
of the sample starts, and the onset temperature (Tonset) is the intersection point of the baseline weight,
either from the beginning of the experiment or the tangent of the
weight versus temperature curve as decomposition arises. The onset
temperature of the ILBS is 230 °C (Figure S3).

4.3.3 DSC Measurements
The DSC measurements
were performed using a METTLER TOLEDO DSC 1 STARe instrument.
The DSC cell was calibrated by using indium (mp 156.6 °C; ΔHfusion = 28.42 J/g) and zinc (mp 419.6 °C;
ΔHfusion = 112.0 J/g). An amount
of 20–30 mg of the opaque gel samples was introduced into the
equipment aluminum “pan” that was heated in the temperature
range of 20–70 °C at the heating rate of 2 °C min–1 under a N2 atmosphere. To check reproducibility,
this cycle was repeated three times. The third scan was used to judge
the transition of the gel from opaque to transparent.

4.3.4 FT-IR Spectroscopy
FT-IR spectra
of the solid LMWG at 25 °C and gel at 25 and 50 °C were
recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR-8400S spectrophotometer with KBr pellets
(1 wt % sample) in the 400–4000 cm–1 region.
Both gel samples were allowed to dry for 2 days under identical conditions
(room temperature) before recording their spectra.

4.3.5 Rheology
Rheological measurements
were carried out using a Physica MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar). A
plate–plate geometry of 49.973 mm diameter and a default gap
of 0.4 mm were used. Frequency scans were performed at 1–100
rad s–1 under a strain of 5% (linear viscoelastic
region). These measurements were done within the viscoelastic region
where G′ and G″ are
independent of strain amplitude. Strain scans were performed from
0.1 to 100% with a constant frequency of 1 rad s–1. The critical strain was quoted as the point that G′ starts to deviate for linearity and ultimately crosses over G″, resulting in gel breakdown.

4.3.6 Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM images were recorded
with a Philips CM-200 electron microscope
at a working voltage of 200 kV. The sample (20 μL) was dispersed
in 2 mL of water, and then solutions were spread on a copper grid
(200 mesh) coated with a carbon Formvar. After 10 min, the excess
solution was wiped away with a filter paper. Gel samples were stained
with 1% sodium phosphotungstate solution. Excess liquid was also wiped
with a filter paper after 5 min.

4.3.7 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
The
supramolecular crystalline opaque gel was analyzed on a Hitachi S-3400N
scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV, after drying at the
ambient atmosphere. The gel samples were gold-coated.

4.3.8 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The FE-SEM
experiment was performed by placing a 20–30 mg
gel sample on a microscope cover glass. The opaque gel sample was
dried under reduced pressure and coated with platinum for at least
90 s at 5 kV voltages. The average thickness of the coating layer
of platinum was 2–3 nm. The micrographs were taken using a
FE-SEM (S-4800, Hitachi).

4.3.9 Inverted Optical Microscope
Phase
behavior was investigated using a Nikon Eclipse TS 100 inverted optical
microscope with the high-intensity light-emitting diode eco-illumination
system. Opaque gels were placed between two glass slides at room temperature,
and the gel texture was recorded with a Nikon camera.

4.3.10 Turbidity and UV–Vis Absorption
Study
The gel-to-gel transition of opaque to transparent
gel was confirmed upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 50 °C,
and UV–vis absorption spectra (dyes, drugs, and gels) were
recorded with a Varian Cary 50 UV spectrophotometer at 25 °C.

4.3.11 Gel Preparation
The respective
amount of CnEMeImBr powder was weighed
into a glass vial and then water was added in a fixed amount (10 mL).
The pH of the solution was adjusted by phosphate buffer solution.
The mixture was agitated (vortex mixer), and the homogeneous solution
was heated to 60 °C. Upon heating, the solution became isotropic
and transparent at 50 °C. The glass vials were then left to equilibrate
at room temperature for 24 h to obtain the opaque gel (Web-Enhanced
Objects). It is to be noted here that we had cropped the video (57
s) in order to save the size and for better attention of the reader.

4.3.12 Stability of the Gel
4.3.12.1 pH Stability
The degradation
study of the ionogel was performed in phosphate buffer solutions at
pH = 5 and 7.4. A weighed amount of the ionogel was added to the appropriate
buffer, and the solution was magnetically stirred at 50–70
rpm at room temperature. The beakers containing the gel samples were
incubated for 12 days at controlled conditions of temperature and
pressure (25 °C, atmospheric pressure). The change in weight
of the gel was observed at regular intervals to observe the degradation
of the gel in different buffer solutions. Degradation was calculated
by the following equation:  where ma is the dry mass of the sample and
mb is the dry mass of the sample after the certain time of degradation.

4.3.12.2 Dilution Stability
Two different
gel samples of 2 mL volume (opaque and transparent) at 9.60% w/v of
each were prepared in two different vials. To this, 2 mL of water
(25 °C in first and 50 °C in another) was carefully added
from the top of the vial. The vials were shaken carefully for 30 min
in 5 min interval to observe the breakage of the gel on dilution.

4.3.13 Absorption of Dye and Encapsulation of
Drug
The dye absorption was carried out in the opaque and
transparent gel (9.60% w/v, 216 mM). The process is monitored by recording
the absorption bands at 463 and 590 nm λmax for MO
and CV, respectively, with a time interval, and the final spectra
were collected after 36 h.

The encapsulation of DS (0.148 mM)
and IM (0.152 mM) in the fibrillar opaque crystalline gel and transparent
gel (9.60% w/v, 216 mM) was monitored by measuring the UV-absorption
spectra at the respective λmax 276 and 255 for DS
and IM, respectively. The process is monitored by recording the absorption
band λmax with a time interval, and the final spectra
were collected after 36 h. The temperature for the fibrillar opaque
crystalline gel and transparent gel was controlled by a Peltier temperature
controller with 0.1 °C accuracy.
