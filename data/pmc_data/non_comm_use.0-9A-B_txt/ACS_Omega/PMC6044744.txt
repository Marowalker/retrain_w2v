In
this study, a simple one-pot method was used to prepare a multifunctional
platform for synergistic chemo- and photothermal therapy,, which is
composed of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as drug nanocarriers
and the embedded graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as local photothermal
seeds. The structure, drug release behavior, photothermal effect,
and synergistic therapeutic efficiency of the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
were systematically investigated. Using doxorubicin (DOX) as a model
anticancer drug, the results showed that monodisperse ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
with a particle size of 50–100 nm could encapsulate DOX during
the synthesis procedure and trigger DOX release under acidic conditions.
The DOX-loaded ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles could efficiently convert near-infrared
(NIR) irradiation into heat and thereby increase the temperature.
More importantly, with breast cancer 4T1 cells as a model cellular
system, the results indicated that the combined chemo- and photothermal
therapy with DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles exhibited a significant synergistic
effect, resulting in a higher efficacy to kill cancer cells compared
with chemotherapy and photothermal therapy alone. Hence, ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles would be promising as versatile nanocarriers for synergistic
cancer therapy.

Introduction
Chemotherapy with toxic
chemotherapeutic drugs is a common therapeutic
approach in cancer therapy. However, direct injection of chemotherapeutic
drugs has a low therapeutic efficiency and causes undesirable side
effects on normal cells.1 To date, much
effort has been made to design carriers for enhancing the delivery
efficiency and reducing the side effects of toxic drugs.2 Liposomes, polymers, and dendrimers are often
used as organic carriers for drug delivery owing to their high biocompatibility
and biodegradability; but, their stability is low, and controlled
drug release is a challenge.3−6 By contrast, inorganic carriers such as gold and
mesoporous silica have a high chemical/physiological stability and
multifunctionality, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability
are under debate.7−10 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are built from metal ions
and organic linkers and have porous crystalline networks with a high
pore volume and surface area, biodegradability, and versatile functionalities,
which show a promising potential in biomedical applications such as
drug delivery and/or imaging.11,12

Zeolitic imidazolate
framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a type of nontoxic
biocompatible MOF, consisting of inorganic zinc ions acting as nodes
connected by 2-methylimidazolate linkers.13 Furthermore, ZIF-8 is stable under physiological conditions and
decomposes under acidic conditions, resulting in the possibility to
construct pH-sensitive drug–delivery systems.14 Drug loading in ZIF-8 is often used for postsynthesis approaches.15−17 For example, Sun et al. loaded 5-Fu in ZIF-8 nanoparticles after
ZIF-8 synthesis, and the release results showed that approximately
50% of 5-Fu was released via slow release during the early stage in
a pH 7.4 solution, but the 5-Fu release rate was significantly increased
in a pH 5 solution.15 However, the postsynthesis
approaches are only suitable for loading small molecular drugs because
of the small diameter of the pore outlets of MOF and often result
in low drug loadings and rapid or poorly controlled release of drug
molecules. Recently, studies have demonstrated a “ship-in-a-bottle”
strategy to encapsulate drug molecules during the synthesis of MOFs,
which overcomes the drawbacks of postsynthesis approaches to some
extent.18−20 For example, Liédana et al. achieved in situ
encapsulation of caffeine in ZIF-8 nanoparticles with a high loading
capacity of 28 wt % and a controlled release over 27 days.18 Zheng et al. reported one-pot synthesis of ZIF-8
with encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) molecules, which showed promise
in pH-responsive drug delivery.20

However, controlled drug delivery is not enough to treat cancers
because of the multidrug resistance of cancer cells.21 Currently, many studies are proposing the combination of
chemotherapy with other therapeutic approaches, such as magnetic hyperthermia,
photothermal therapy, and gene therapy, to obtain synergistic therapeutic
effects.22−24 Among them, photothermal therapy is a minimally invasive
local treatment that uses the photoabsorbers located in tumors to
convert near-infrared (NIR) energy into heat, resulting in irreversible
cellular damage and subsequent tumor destruction.25 Therefore, functionalization of ZIF-8 with photoabsorbers
could form a multifunctional platform for the combination of controlled
drug delivery and photothermal therapy and thereby enhance the therapeutic
efficiency.

To date, a variety of photoabsorbers including gold
nanorods, copper
chalcogenides, and carbon nanomaterials have been investigated for
photothermal therapy.26−28 Graphene oxide (GO) including sheets and graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) has gained growing attention as a photoabsorber
because of its good NIR absorbance, high photothermal conversion efficiency,
excellent thermal conductivity, and low toxicity.29−31 Furthermore,
the hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups on GO enable to functionalize
the MOF for the formation of MOF/GO composite nanoparticles, which
could endow the MOF nanoparticles with the photothermal effect. On
the one hand, studies demonstrated that MOF nanoparticles could be
easily functionalized with various materials.32−36 For example, Wuttke et al. reported the synthesis
of MOF/lipid nanoparticles as nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery
or imaging.32 Wang et al. designed a targeting
drug–delivery system based on bicyclononyne functionalized
β-cyclodextrin derivative (β-CD-SS-BCN) functionalized
MIL-101 nanoparticles, which exhibited
a controlled drug release because of the pH-responsive benzoic imine
bond and the redox-responsive disulfide bond on the modified surface.33 On the other hand, many studies have recently
reported MOF/graphene composite materials in different applications.37−44 For example, Biswal et al. proposed a simple strategy to encapsulate
and stabilize GO inside of ZIF-8 nanoparticles, which results in tailing
the photoluminescent emission of GO@ZIF-8 nanocrystals even after
3 months of aging.37 Zhou et al. synthesized
a reduced GO (rGO)@MIL-101 composite using a solvothermal method,
and the rGO@MIL-101 nanoparticles exhibited a high adsorption capacity
for acetone.38 Huang and Liu prepared a
rGO/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) hybrid nanocomposite photocatalyst
and found that the composite exhibited a more efficient photocatalytic
performance than NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for methyl blue degradation
under visible light irradiation.39 However,
there are no reports describing the construction of MOF/GO or MOF/GQD
composite nanoparticles for synergistic drug delivery and photothermal
therapy.

In this study, we have developed ZIF-8/GQD multifunctional
nanoparticles
with encapsulation of drug molecules using a one-pot synthesis method,
which could achieve synergistic-controlled drug delivery and photothermal
therapy. As shown in the schematic illustration (Figure 1), using anticancer drug DOX
as a model drug, DOX molecules could be in situ encapsulated into
the micropores of ZIF-8 framework during crystal growth because of
the formation of weak coordination bonds between DOX molecules and
zinc ions.18−20 The GQD addition induces the adsorption of GQDs on
the DOX-loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles to form DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
through the hydrogen bonding interaction between the N–H groups
of 2-methylimidazole in ZIF-8 and the hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl
groups on GQDs. After endocytosis by cancer cells, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles could not only realize intracellular drug release because
of the acidic environment in cancer cells but also induce photothermal
therapy by NIR irradiation because of the photothermal effect of GQDs.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD Nanoparticles
The representative
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles are
spherical and highly monodisperse, and the particle sizes are between
50 and 100 nm. Compared with the ZIF-8 nanoparticles without GQD addition,
the DOX loading and GQD addition did not significantly change the
morphology of ZIF-8 nanoparticles. The particle size distributions
of ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in H2O, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) measured using dynamic laser scattering
(DLS) were relatively narrow, and the average particle sizes in different
solutions were close to each other (Supporting Information), suggesting the good dispersity of ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD,
and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in aqueous solution. The average particle
sizes of ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles measured
using DLS were a little bigger than those observed using SEM, which
might be attributed to a solvation layer around the nanoparticles
for DLS measurements. When the suspensions of ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, and
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were statically placed for 12 h, each
type of suspension still exhibited good dispersity, and only a small
amount of sediments was observed on the bottom (Supporting Information). It indicates that ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD,
and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles could stably disperse in a physiological
environment for a period of time and are beneficial for drug delivery.
TEM images showed that the GQD components in the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles were distributed at the edges of spherical ZIF-8 nanoparticles
in a circular manner, which are similar to the results reported by
Biswal et al.37 In the synthesis procedure,
the GQD solution was added after ZIF-8 growth for 15 min, which resulted
in the GQD adsorption on the initial ZIF-8 colloidal nanoparticles
because of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the N–H
groups of 2-methylimidazole in ZIF-8 and the hydroxyl, epoxy, and
carboxyl groups on GQDs. After GQD adsorption, the ZIF-8 nanoparticles
would continue to grow owing to the residual Zn2+ and 2-methylimidazole
in the reaction system.

Figure 2 SEM and TEM images of ZIF-8 (A,D), ZIF-8/GQD
(B,E), and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
(C,F) nanoparticles.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZIF-8/GQD
and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles are shown in Figure 3. For comparison, the XRD patterns of GQDs, DOX, and
a mechanically mixed ZIF-8 and GQD sample (ZIF-8/GQDs-M) are also
presented in Figure 3. ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were highly crystalline
with sharp diffraction peaks, and the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles exhibited only peaks from ZIF-8 without any new peaks
or peaks from GQDs and DOX, which is in agreement with the results
of previous reports on ZIF-8/GQD composites.40 This indicates that GQDs might form interactions with ZIF-8 in the
ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles during the synthesis procedure
because of the rich hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy groups on GQDs and
abundant N–H functional groups of 2-methylimidazole. However,
the characteristic peaks of GQDs and ZIF-8 can be clearly observed
in the pattern of the mechanically mixed ZIF-8/GQDs-M sample, suggesting
there is no interaction between GQDs and ZIF-8 in the mechanical mixed
sample. On the other hand, no peaks from DOX were observed in the
pattern of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, which might be attributed
to the formation of amorphous DOX in the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.
Previous study demonstrated that DOX molecules were encapsulated in
the microporous framework of ZIF-8 nanoparticles during the one-pot
synthesis,19 and the microporous framework
confined the growth of the DOX crystals.

Figure 3 Wide-angle XRD patterns
of GQDs, DOX, ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD, ZIF-8-GQDs-M,
and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra also confirmed
the interaction
between GQDs and ZIF-8 in the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.
As shown in Figure 4, the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles exhibit FTIR spectra
similar to ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Most of the absorption bands for ZIF-8,
ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles are associated with the
vibrations of the imidazole units, such as the peak at 1575 cm–1 is assigned as the C=N stretching vibration,
and the bands in the range of 1350–1500 cm–1 are associated with the imidazole ring stretching. The strong bands
at 1145 and 994 cm–1 are attributed to the C–N
stretching of the imidazole units. However, the mechanically mixed
ZIF-8 and GQD sample (ZIF-8/GQDs-M) shows not only the absorption
bands from ZIF-8 but also the characteristic bands from GQDs, such
as the C=O stretching vibration at 1728 cm–1 and the stretching deformation vibration of intercalated water at
1620 cm–1. The above results indicate the interactions
between ZIF-8 and GQDs in the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.
In addition, the absorption bands for DOX in the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
may be overlapped with the absorption bands for ZIF-8 because of the
low DOX content in the composites.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of GQDs, DOX, ZIF-8, ZIF-8/GQD,
ZIF-8-GQDs-M, and
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.

Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra
could
verify the DOX loading in the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 5, free DOX has a
characteristic absorbance peak at 488 nm, which could be clearly observed
on the spectrum of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, whereas ZIF-8 and
ZIF-8/GQDs show no peak in this region. This indicates that DOX is
encapsulated in the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles during the synthesis procedure.
By calculating the reduction in the DOX concentration from the initial
DOX solution and the residual DOX amount in the supernatant after
synthesis using UV–vis analysis, approximately 90% of DOX loading
efficiency could be achieved, and the DOX loading capacity in the
ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles was estimated to be 47 μg/mg. As shown
in the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure 6), the weight loss in the temperature range
of 200–250 °C for the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
is attributed to the decomposition of GQDs, and the weight loss for
the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles was close to each other.
Notably, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles showed a much higher weight
loss (5.03%) than the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, which is attributed
to the DOX decomposition. The DOX loading amount was calculated to
be 52.9 μg/mg, which is close to the result obtained using UV–vis
analysis. Therefore, ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles could encapsulate anticancer
drugs to form a multifunctional platform with synergistic-controlled
drug delivery and photothermal effect.

DOX Release from DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
Nanoparticles
To investigate
the DOX release from the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles under different
pH conditions, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were dispersed in phosphate-buffered
solution with pH 7.4, 6.0, and 4.5, separately. As shown in Figure 7, only 12% of the
loaded DOX was released from the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles after
24 h in the pH 7.4 solution at 37 °C. On the contrary, DOX was
released rapidly at lower pH solutions. In the pH 6.0 solution, approximately
68% of DOX was released within 24 h, and much more DOX ( approximately
80%) was released in the pH 4.5 solution. Obviously, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles exhibited a pH-responsive DOX release behavior. As reported
before, ZIF-8 nanoparticles are stable under neutral conditions (pH
7.4) and can decompose under acidic conditions.20 In this study, SEM was used to observe the decomposition
of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in PBS at pH 7.4, 6.0, and 4.5
for different immersion times. The DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles are
spherical and have good dispersity before immersing in different PBS
solutions (Figure 2). However, the morphology showed different changes after immersing
in PBS at pH 7.4, 6.0, and 4.5. As shown in Figure 8, after immersing in PBS at pH 7.4 for 4
and 8 h, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles still maintained a spherical
morphology and good dispersity. However, when the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
were immersed in PBS at pH 6.0 and 4.5, the spherical nanoparticles
changed to be irregular materials because of the framework decomposition.
On increasing the immersing time and decreasing the pH value of PBS,
more significant morphology changes were observed, suggesting that
a lower pH environment could accelerate the decomposition of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles. On the other hand, the interaction between ZIF-8 and
GQDs would be gradually weaker with decreasing pH value, thereby inducing
the dissociation of GQDs from ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Therefore, the
release of DOX from the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles at lower pH is
associated with the dissociation of GQDs and the decomposition of
ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Hence, the release behavior of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles makes it interesting as a potential pH-responsive drug-delivery
system for cancer therapy. In general, the physiological environment
of blood stream and normal organs and tissues is neutral (pH 7.4),
but it changes into an acidic condition (pH 4.5–6.0) in a tumor
tissue or cancer cells.45 Owing to the
different physiological environment, the DOX molecules in the ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles could be prevented from releasing during the delivery
in blood circulation, but the DOX release could be triggered when
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles arrived at the tumor tissue or internalized
into cancer cells. Therefore, the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles as nanocarriers
for drug delivery could not only enhance delivery efficiency but also
reduce the side effect of toxic drugs to normal organs and tissues.

Photothermal Effect of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD Nanoparticles
The DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles had the photothermal effect because
of the GQD encapsulation in the DOX-loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles. The
temperature changes under NIR irradiation at various laser intensities
are shown in Figure 9A. It can be seen that the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles could efficiently
convert NIR energy into heat and thereby increase the temperature
of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension. In addition, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
exhibited an excellent photothermal conversion capacity. For example,
the temperature of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension at a concentration
of 5 mg/mL increased from 30 °C to 49.5 °C within 10 min
of irradiation at a power of 2.0 W/cm2, and the generated
heat was enough for thermal therapy. Furthermore, the temperature
changes of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles increased with the increase
in the laser power intensity. The temperature changes of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
suspension with different concentrations under NIR irradiation at
1.5 W/cm2 are shown in Figure 9B. The photothermal effect of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles enhanced with the concentration at the same laser power
intensity. The temperature of the suspension at 5 mg/mL increased
from 30 °C to 40 °C after 10 min of irradiation, but that
at 20 mg/mL increased from 30 °C to 50.2 °C after the same
irradiation time. On the other hand, the photothermal effect of the
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in H2O and culture medium DMEM
at the same concentration was investigated (Figure 9B). At a concentration of 20 mg/mL, the temperature
increase curve of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension in H2O almost
overlapped to that in DMEM, which suggested that the photothermal
effect of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in H2O might
mimic that in the physiological environment. Therefore, the photothermal
effect of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles endows them with potential
applications in photothermal therapy, and the therapeutic temperature
can be controlled by the NIR intensity, the irradiation time, and
the concentration of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.

min; (B) Photothermal effects of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in water

In Vitro Cytotoxicity and Cell Uptake
To evaluate the
in vitro cytotoxicity of the nanocarriers and the cell uptake of the
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD delivery system, breast cancer line 4T1 cells were used
as a cellular system in this study. Cell viability was measured using
a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity
of the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles. It can be observed that the cell viabilities
did not decrease even up to a concentration of 200 μg/mL, when
4T1 cells were incubated with ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles for 24 h (Figure 10), suggesting no
cytotoxicity for the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles. This indicates that
ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles are safe and could be used as nanocarriers
for drug delivery.

Figure 10 Cell viability of 4T1 cells after incubation with ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles
at different concentrations as measured using a CCK-8 assay.

Cell uptake of the drug delivery
system is desirable in cancer
therapy. For the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, the internalization
of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles by cancer cells could not only
enhance the DOX delivery efficiency but also improve the photothermal
therapeutic efficacy because of the local heat generation in cancer
cells. Figure 11 shows
the confocal microscope images of 4T1 cells after 4 h of incubation
with the free DOX, ZIF-8/GQD, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles. The
DOX concentration for the free DOX solution and the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
suspension was 0.5 μg/mL, and the concentration of the ZIF-8/GQD
suspension was same as that of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension. For free
DOX, red fluorescence from DOX was observed in 4T1 cells, suggesting
that free DOX could internalize into 4T1 cells. For ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles,
green fluorescence from GQDs in 4T1 cells indicated that the ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles internalized into 4T1 cells, whereas for the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles, we observed red and green fluorescence from DOX and
GQDs in 4T1 cells, and the intensity of red fluorescence from DOX
was a little stronger than that of free DOX, suggesting that the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles were easy to internalize into 4T1 cells and could release
DOX efficiently in cells. On the other hand, the intensities of red
fluorescence from DOX and green fluorescence from GQDs increased with
the initial concentrations of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles (Supporting Information), suggesting that the
increase in the initial concentration could enhance the internalization
capacity of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles into cells. The intensities
of red fluorescence from DOX and green fluorescence from GQDs also
increased with incubation time (Supporting Information), which indicated that more DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were taken
up by cells with the increase in the incubation time. Therefore, combining
with the pH-responsive drug release behavior, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
showed promise in intracellular drug delivery.

Synergistic Effect of Chemo-
and Photothermal Therapy of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
Nanoparticles
To investigate the synergistic effect of the
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles on therapeutic efficiency, 4T1 cells were
treated for 8 h with the free DOX, ZIF-8/GQDs, and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
at the same concentrations and were followed by NIR irradiation for
3 min at 2.5 W/cm2. As shown in the bright-field images
(Figure 12A), without
NIR irradiation, 4T1 cells treated with ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles still
showed a well-spreading cell morphology, suggesting no cell apoptosis
because of the biocompatibility of the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles. However,
the cell morphology of partial 4T1 cells changed to spherical morphology
with the treatment of free DOX and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, indicating
apoptosis of the partial 4T1 cells, which is attributed to chemotherapy.
With NIR irradiation, 4T1 cells treated with free DOX showed a similar
cell morphology to that without NIR irradiation, suggesting that NIR
irradiation did not influence the DOX therapeutic efficacy. However,
most of 4T1 cells treated with ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
showed a spherical morphology, which indicated that NIR irradiation
induced cell apoptosis significantly because of the thermal effect
of ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles.

of 4T1 cells after 8 h of incubation (a)
without free DOX solution and (b) with free DOX solution, (c) with
ZIF-8/GQD, and (d) with DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspensions (DOX: 5 μg/mL,
ZIF-8/GQDs: 100 μg/mL), the images of a1–d1 were recorded
without NIR irradiation, and the images of a2–d2 were recorded
after NIR irradiation for 3 min. (B) Cell viability of 4T1 cells after
8 h of incubation without and with free DOX solution, ZIF-8/GQD, and
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspensions (DOX: 5 μg/mL, ZIF-8/GQDs: 100 μg/mL)
and without and with 3 min NIR irradiation.

To further quantitatively evaluate the synergistic effect
of the
DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles on therapeutic efficiency, cell viabilities
of the treated 4T1 cells after 8 h of incubation with the free DOX,
ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were tested. As shown in Figure 12B, free DOX could
kill cancer cells, and only 75% of the cell viability was obtained
after the treatment by free DOX with or without NIR irradiation. Obviously,
the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles had negligible cytotoxicity without NIR
irradiation, but the cell viability decreased significantly (approximately
32%) upon NIR irradiation, which indicates the excellent photothermal
therapeutic efficiency of the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles against cancer
cells. However, it is worth noting that the cell viability decreased
(approximately 84%) without NIR irradiation after incubation with
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, which is attributed to the DOX release
from the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in cells, triggered by a lower
pH environment. When NIR irradiation was applied to treat 4T1 cells
after incubation with the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, cell viability
decreased significantly (approximately 18%), and it is also much lower
than that of the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles with NIR irradiation. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles as a multifunctional
platform could achieve the synergistic therapeutic efficiency through
chemo- and photothermal therapy.

Experimental Section
Materials
2-Methylimidazole (99%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99%), and methanol (HPLC grade)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was purchased
from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. GQDs (1 mg/mL) were purchased
from Nanjing XFNANO Co. Ltd. Ultrapure water was obtained from a Millipore
pure
water system. All chemicals were used without further purification.

Synthesis of ZIF-8 Nanoparticles
ZIF-8 nanoparticles
were synthesized according to a previous report with some modifications.19 Typically, 95 mg of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of H2O under
magnetic agitation for 15 min. Subsequently, 200 mg (2.43 mmol) of
2-methylimidazole in 50 mL of H2O was added to the above
Zn(NO3)2 solution at room temperature, with
magnetic agitation for another 1 h. Finally, the nanoparticles were
collected by centrifugation and washing several times with ethanol
and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h.

Synthesis of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
Nanoparticles
For a typical
synthesis, 95 mg of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of H2O under magnetic agitation
for 15 min, and 2 mL of DOX solution (2 mg/mL) was added to Zn(NO3)2 solution. Subsequently, 200 mg (2.43 mmol) of
2-methylimidazole in 50 mL of H2O was added to the above
solution at room temperature, with magnetic agitation for another
15 min to form a mixed suspension. Then, 1 mL of GQD solution was
added to the above mixed suspension. After 1 h of reaction, the nanoparticles
were collected by centrifugation and washing several times with ethanol
and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h.

As a control,
the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were synthesized similar to that of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles without the addition of DOX solution.

Characterization
SEM was carried out using an FEI Quanta
450 field emission scanning electron microscope. TEM images were obtained
using a Tecnai G2 F30 electron microscope operating at an acceleration
voltage of 300 kV. Powder XRD patterns were obtained using a D8 ADVANCE
powder diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (1.5405 Å).
FTIR spectra were recorded on a LAM750(s) spectrometer in transmission
mode. TG analysis was carried out on an STA 449 F3 thermal analyzer
under N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 mL/min and a
heating rate of 10 °C/min. UV–vis analysis was performed
using a NanoDrop 2000C spectrophotometer. Photothermal effects of
the samples were measured using an infrared thermal imaging system
with a diode laser.

Drug Release
To investigate the
drug release behavior
from the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles, 20 mg of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles
was dispersed in 10 mL of PBS solution (pH 4.5, 6.0, and 7.4, separately).
The release system was maintained at 37 °C under dark conditions
and shaking (100 rpm). At a given time, the release system was centrifuged,
and an aliquot (20 μL) of the supernatant was taken out for
UV–vis analysis at the wavelength of 488 nm and replaced with
the same amount of fresh medium. The release percentages of DOX were
calculated according to the equation: DOX (%) = total released DOX/total
loaded DOX in ZIF-8/GQDs × 100%. Before the calculation, a standard
curve for the DOX solution was recorded using a NanoDrop 2000C spectrophotometer.

Photothermal Effect of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD Nanoparticles
Typically,
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were dispersed in H2O and
culture medium (DMEM) at different concentrations. Subsequently,
1 mL of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension in each well of a 96-well plate
was irradiated for 10 min using a diode laser (808 nm) at a distance
of 1.0 cm. To determine the impacts of irradiation intensity, an 808
nm laser irradiated the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspensions at a concentration
of 5 mg/mL, with the power intensities at 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 W/cm2 for 10 min. To determine the effects of the suspension concentrations,
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspensions at concentrations from 5 to 20 mg/mL
were irradiated using an 808 nm laser at 1.5 W/cm2 for
10 min. An infrared thermometer monitored the temperature of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
suspensions every 30 s, and the temperature changes were transferred
into a computer through the optical fiber.

Cell Culture
To
evaluate the potential property of
the ZIF-8/GQD and DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles in the cellular system,
breast cancer line 4T1 cells were used in this study. 4T1 cells were
cultured in DMEM and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin and incubated in 5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
In vitro cytotoxicity of the
ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles was evaluated using a CCK-8 assay. Before
cell culture, the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles sterilized with UV irradiation
were dispersed in DMEM to obtain the stack solution with different
concentrations. 4T1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density
of 5 × 104 cells/well. After seeding the cells for
4 h to allow the attachment of the cells, the cells were washed with
PBS, and the ZIF-8/GQD solution was immediately added into each well
to achieve the final ZIF-8/GQD concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 100, and
200 μg/mL, and the final medium volume in each well was 100
μL. After incubation of cells for 24 h, 10 μL of CCK-8
solution was added into each well, and the cells were incubated for
another 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was then measured using a microplate
reader (ELX800, BioTek). Cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage
of viable cells compared with that of untreated control cells.

Cell Uptake
To verify the cell uptake of the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
nanoparticles, 4T1 cells were seeded in a 35 mm Petri dish with 1
× 105 cells and cultured for 12 h to attach on the
bottom. After the cells were washed with PBS, 0.5 mL of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
solution in DMEM was added into the Petri dish with a concentration
from 5 to 15 μg/mL. Free DOX and ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were
used for comparison. After incubation of cells for 2, 4, and 8 h,
the cells were washed with PBS three times to remove the extracellular
nanoparticles and dead cells. Then, 1.5 mL of DAPI methanolic solution
was added to the Petri dish to stain the nuclei of 4T1 cells for 15
min. Finally, the cells were washed several times with PBS and were
observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Leica,
SP8).

Synergistic Chemo- and Photothermal Therapy of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD
Nanoparticles on Cancer Cells
4T1 cells were seeded into
a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well
and incubated for 4 h to allow the attachment of the cells. After
the removal of the culture medium, 100 μL of DOX-ZIF-8/GQD solution
(100 μg/mL in DMEM, [DOX] = 5 μg/mL) was added into each
well. The same concentrations of free DOX solution (5 μg/mL)
and ZIF-8/GQD solution (100 μg/mL) were used for comparison.
After incubation of cells for 8 h, the cells were washed with PBS
and fresh DMEM was added. Then, the cells were irradiated for 3 min
using an 808 nm laser at a distance of 1.0 cm and a power intensity
of 2.5 w/cm2. After irradiation, the cells were cultured
for 4 h and then observed using fluorescence microscopy. After that,
10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added into each well, and the cells
were incubated for another 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured
using a microplate reader (ELX800, BioTek). Cell viability was expressed
in comparison with that of untreated control cells.

Conclusions
In this study, we reported the synthesis of ZIF-8/GQD multifunctional
nanoparticles with encapsulation of anticancer drug for synergistic
chemo- and photothermal therapy. The DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles were
monodisperse, and the particle size was approximately 50–100
nm. They could not only generate heat efficiently to increase the
temperature because of NIR irradiation but also have a pH-responsive
drug release behavior. Using breast cancer 4T1 cells as a cellular
system, the ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles had negligible cytotoxicity and
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles could be taken up by 4T1 cells. Interestingly,
the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles showed a synergistic effect to kill
cancer cells because of the pH-controlled DOX release and the photothermal
effect of GQDs. Therefore, the DOX-ZIF-8/GQD nanoparticles would be
a promising multifunctional system for potential cancer therapy.
