The inorganic particles
used as a compatibilizer play a role in
crack termination and heat resistance. However, the poor compatibility
of inorganic particles and polymer hinders their application. Herein,
the double spherical SiO2@PDVB Janus particles (JPs) were
modified with triethylenetetramine (TETA), and the obtained anisotropic
TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs were used as the compatibilizer
of acrylic resin/epoxy resin (AR/EP) composites. The modification
and the compatibilization of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs
were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical
analyzer, impact test, tensile test, and so forth. Results show that
amino groups grafted onto the SiO2 lobe can react with
epoxy groups of EP, which results in the TETA–SiO2 lobe being embedded in the EP phase and the PDVB lobe being pushed
toward the AR phase. The TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs anchored
at the interface of AR and EP increase their interfacial adhesion,
decrease the domain phase size and distribution of dispersed AR, and
improve the compatibility of AR/EP composites. The compatibilization
of nanoparticles (NPs) is realized by the cavitation and blunting
of different scaled AR phase domain distributions and that of JPs
is realized by the strong interfacial force originated by JPs. Moreover,
the desorption energy of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is higher
than that of SiO2–TETA; so the glass transition
temperature (Tg) of AR/EP/JP composites
is higher than that of AR/EP/NP composites. The strong interfacial
adhesion and high desorption energy endow TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs with a toughening effect and enhancing effect. The impact
strength and the tensile strength of AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB composites are 16.03 kJ/m2 and 63.12 MPa, which
are 9.91 kJ/m2 and 16.32 MPa higher than those of AR/EP
composites, respectively. JPs used in the thermosetting EP is benefit
to its toughening study and the new anisotropic Janus compatibilizer.

1 Introduction
Polymer
blending is a simple and efficient way to obtain a kind
of material with desirable properties. It is also an energy-saving
and economical production method in the industry. However, the incompatibility
of polymers inhibits the combination of excellent properties of blends.
Therefore, improving blend compatibility is very crucial and becomes
a research focus. Traditionally, efforts have been focused on the
improvement of the morphological behavior of such blends via the incorporation
of compatibilizing phases, which are either miscible or can chemically
react with both blend components.1 There
are many compatibilizers available such as reactive polymers,2,3 organic copolymers (block, random, or grafted),4−6 nanoparticles
(NPs),7 and so forth.

NPs can reduce
the interfacial tension because of their surface
effect. Inorganic NPs can also be used as compatibilizers because
they tend to bridge immiscible polymers and offer their own intrinsic
functionalities.8 The SiO2 NPs
with high surface energy and adsorption capacity is nontoxic and nonpolluting.
The surface of SiO2 NPs contains active hydroxyl groups,
which can be physically entangled or chemically reacted with composite
materials.9,10 As an environmental friendly inherent nanofiller,
SiO2 NPs without functional modification are often used
as fillers or coatings for toughening and11 materials with aging resistance or abrasion resistance. The functionalized
SiO2 NPs have wider applications, such as printing binder,12 drug carrier,13 pigment
(dyed),14 antibacterial materials,15 compatibilizer,16−18 and so on. Zhang16 studied the compatibilization of PP/polystyrene
(PS) with SiO2 NPs and found that PP/PS blend compatibility
could be dramatically improved with the addition of SiO2 NPs containing a large number of alkyls in their surface. The functionalized
SiO2 NPs possessed more efficient compatibilization than
unmodified SiO2 NPs. Anisotropic Janus particles (JPs)
have higher interfacial activity, higher interfacial desorption energy,
and lower surface tension than isotropic NPs. The JPs with two faces
can be adsorbed strongly at interfaces, stronger than homogeneous
NPs.19−21 Besides, the combination of amphiphilicity and particulate
character (Pickering effect) favors strong and selective adsorption
to interfaces because the chemical property of either face is similar
with one phase of blends.22 JPs are compartmentalized
colloids which possess two sides of different chemistries or polarities.23,24 These particles have broad potential applications in solid surfactants,
oil and water separation,25,26 optical probes and
E-paper display technology,27 and compatibilizers.20,28 Nie29 synthesized a Janus nanosheet and
evaluated its ability to trap nonequilibrium morphology by interfacial
self-assembly. The Janus nanosheet was synthesized by selectively
grafting polymer chains, PS, or polyisoprene (PI) on each side of
a silica nanosheet. The selective grafting endowed the nanosheet with
two different wettabilities, which made it possible to self-assemble
and further jam at the PS/PI interface. The study showed that the
interfacial jamming nanosheet could trap the intermediate, nonequilibrium
morphology during phase separation of polymer blends. The Janus nanosheet
had high interfacial activity and could reduce the free energy of
blends more effectively.

Epoxy resins (EP) are widely used in
areas such as coatings, adhesives,
structural applications, and electronics because of their thermal
and chemical resistance, superior electrical properties, relatively
low shrinkage, and good adhesion to many substrates.30 However, as a thermosetting resin, the brittleness of EP
limits its application.31 The common toughening
method of EP is the introduction of the second phase into the EP matrix,
which is used to absorb stress. Rubber elastomers, thermoplastic resins,
and rigid particles are known as toughening agents for EP.32,33 Acrylic resin (AR) has excellent anti-impact properties of elastomers
and perfect thermal stability of resins. It is quite different from
EP toughened by rubber because AR is a polar material. The domain
size of the AR-dispersed phase is small and uniform. However, this
blending structure is not beneficial to transfer stress. It is important
to increase the dispersity of domain size of the dispersed phase in
order to play different roles of different scale particles.34

Herein, the lobe of SiO2 in
SiO2@PDVB was
modified with triethylenetetramine (TETA), and the obtained TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs were used as the compatibilizer of AR/EP composites.
The effects of the dosage of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs
on the AR/EP phase behavior, glass transition temperature, and mechanical
properties were investigated. The distribution and the location of
TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs in AR/EP blends were also studied.
The isotropic SiO2–TETA NPs were compared with the
anisotropic JPs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of TETA–SiO2@PDVB
JPs
Figure 1a,b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of unmodified
and modified SiO2@PDVB JPs. It shows that SiO2@PDVB JPs are double spherical-like and have strict chemical compartmentalization
between two lobes. The large lobe is organic PDVB and the small lobe
is inorganic SiO2. The hydroxyl content of the SiO2 lobe increases after it is activated with HCl and H2O2. In the presence of zeolite, dehydration reaction happens
between the amino in TETA and the hydroxyl on the SiO2 lobe.
The TETA chains are grafted onto the surface of the SiO2 lobe, and so the diameter of the TETA–SiO2 lobe
increases by 34 nm (Figure 1c). At the same time, the long axis of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs increases to about 614 nm from 580 nm of unmodified
SiO2@PDVB JPs.

Figure 1 Micrographs of (a) SiO2@PDVB JPs,
(b) TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs, and its (c) synthesis diagram.

2.2 Chemical
Composition of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs
Figure 2a shows the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
results of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs. According to the
binding energy lookup table for signals from elements and common chemical
species, the chemical shift of Si 2p in SiO2 is 103.50
eV, while that of Si 2p in TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs moves
to 102.93 eV. Because of the reaction of TETA and SiO2,
the Si–O bond on the surface of the SiO2 lobe is
replaced by the Si–N bond. The electronegativity of the N element
is smaller than that of the O element, so the deshielding effect of
the N element is less than that of the O element, which results in
the decrease in the chemical shift. It is more important that the
N 1s peak in 397.62 eV confirms the dehydration reaction between amino
groups and hydroxyl groups. In addition, the methyl and methylene
absorptive peaks in the IR spectrum (support Figure 1) of SiO2–TETA NPs show
that there is no problem of reaction between TETA and SiO2 lobes.

Figure 2 (a) XPS spectrum of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs and (b)
TGA curves of SiO2@PDVB and TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs.

Figure 2b shows
the thermograms of SiO2@PDVB and TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs. The thermogravimetric curve of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is divided into two stages that are the degradation of
the TETA onto the SiO2 lobe and PDVB lobe. The starting
decomposition temperature of TETA from TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is 200 °C. Nitrogen release from the TETA decomposition
helps extinguish the flame, that is to say, the TETA coated onto the
surface of the SiO2 lobe increases the modified JPs’s
fire retardancy. As a result, the decomposition temperature of the
PDVB lobe of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is higher than that
of SiO2@PDVB JPs.

2.3 Brittle Surficial Morphology
of AR/EP Composites
Figure 3 shows SEM
images of the AR/EP composite brittle fracture surface. For AR/EP
composites, the surface is very clear and the phase domain size of
the AR dispersion is very uniform because they are both polar polymers
(Figure 3a). In contrast,
in the presence of unmodified SiO2, the phase domain distribution
of AR becomes broad and ranges from 0.18 to 3.5 μm (Figure 3b) because of the
nano-effect of SiO2. However, the unmodified SiO2 NPs are apt to be coagulated in the EP matrix (red line area). Once
the compatibilizer of SiO2 NPs is replaced by SiO2–TETA NPs, the phase domain distribution of AR becomes broader
than that of SiO2 NPs and ranges from 0.14 to 4.5 μm
(Figure 3c) because
of the reaction of amino groups in SiO2–TETA NPs
and the epoxy groups in EP. It is more important that the modified
SiO2–TETA NPs are located at the interface of AR
and EP. No aggregations of SiO2–TETA NPs are observed
in the EP matrix. It is very interesting that the AR-dispersed phase
size becomes small and nonuniform when JP compatibilizers are used
(Figure 3d,e). There
are two different points in AR/EP/SiO2@PDVB composites
and AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB composites. In AR/EP/SiO2@PDVB composites, the interface of AR and EP is distinct and
the JPs protrude on the fracture surface. The outlines of JPs are
very clear. There is no chemical bond action between JPs and AR, and
so JPs are not at the interface of AR and EP. However, in AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB composites, the TETA–SiO2 lobe is
embedded in the EP matrix and the PDVB lobe is pushed toward the AR
area, and the neck of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is anchored
at the interface of AR and EP. The interaction force between TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs and blends mainly comes from the chemical bond between
amino groups and epoxy groups. In order to improve the compatibility
and toughness of the composites, the rigid SiO2 lobe is
modified. SiO2–TETA NPs are taken as an example
of the size effect of the SiO2–TETA lobe on the
composite’s morphology. This is the effect of the ratio of
two JP lobes.

(a) without NPs and JPs and with (b) 2 wt % of SiO2, (c)
2 wt % of SiO2–TETA, (d) 2 wt % of SiO2@PDVB, and (e) 2 wt % of TETA–SiO2@PDVB.

2.4 Effect
of SiO2 Size on AR/EP Composites
The effect of
NP sizes on the compatibilization of AR/EP composites
is shown in Figure 4. The amount of NPs is fixed in 2 wt %. Both SiO2 NPs
and SiO2–TETA NPs of 100 nm can be embedded at the
interface between AR and EP (Figure 4a,d). It is different that more NPs can be found in
the brittle fracture surface of AR/EP/SiO2–TETA
composites than that of AR/EP/SiO2 because of the chemical
reaction of SiO2–TETA NPs with EP. The compatibilization
of NPs is also reflected in the wide-phase domain size of AR when
the NP size is 100 nm. When the NP size increases to 300 and 500 nm,
the AR phase size distribution is narrow in AR/EP. Moreover, the integrated
action of the small AR phase size and the big NP size results in that
NPs are not located at the interface of AR and EP any more.

nm SiO2, (d) 100 nm SiO2–TETA, (e) 300
nm SiO2–TETA, and (f) 500 nm SiO2–TETA.

2.5 Effect
of NP and JP Contents on AR/EP Composites
The effect of the
dosage of NPs and JPs on the phase domain size
of the dispersed phase in AR/EP composites is shown in Figure 5. When 1 wt % of SiO2 NPs or SiO2–TETA NPs is added, the average AR
phase domains size are 854 and 1215 nm, respectively (Figure 6a,b), but the phase domain
size distribution of AR becomes wider by adding 1 wt % of SiO2–TETA NPs than 1 wt % of unmodified SiO2 NPs. When 2 wt % of SiO2 NPs or SiO2–TETA
NPs is added, the phase domain size of AR decreases obviously and
the phase domain size distribution becomes wide (Figure 7a,b). However, when 3 wt %
of SiO2 NPs or SiO2–TETA NPs is added,
the AR phase domains become dense. At the same time, its phase domain
size and distribution become small. It is obvious that NPs can change
the phase domain size and distribution of the dispersed phase. When
the NP content is less than 2 wt %, it cannot play a good role in
the annealing process of the solid surfactant. It is worth noting
that more NPs can be found in the brittle fracture surface of AR/EP/SiO2–TETA than that of AR/EP/SiO2, attributing
to the reaction of amino groups and epoxy groups. When 1 wt % of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is added, the average phase domain size of AR decreases
to 524 nm, which is much smaller than the NPs used (Figure 6c). As TETA–SiO2@PDVB JP content increases to 4 wt %, the phase domain size
of AR remains unchanged and the phase domain distribution becomes
narrow (Figure 7c).
Glaser et al. found that bimetallic JPs led to a significant reduction
of the oil/water interfacial tension as compared to similar uniform
particles.23 Compared with isotropic NPs,
JPs are more effective in reducing interfacial tension. Because of
the different chemical structures of the two lobes of JPs, with the
reaction of the TETA–SiO2 lobe with EP, the PDVB
lobe turns to the AR phase automatically (Scheme 1). The TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs
orient at the AR/EP interface and add the interfacial adhesion of
AR and EP. The TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs anchored in the
AR/EP interface can restrain the agglomeration of the AR-dispersed
phase and the AR phase domain size is concentrated in 0.2–0.9
μm.

2.6 Effect of NPs and JPs on the Compatibility
of AR/EP Composites
Table 1 shows the glass transition temperature (Tg) of AR/EP composites. Tg is an important parameter in polymer blending and is often used
as a criterion for determining the compatibility of blends. It is
difficult to make two phases completely compatible in polymer blending.
Most polymer blending is partially compatible, that is, Tg values of two phases are close to each other. The Tg values of AR/EP composites are 162.5 and 65
°C corresponding to EP and AR. The Tg difference of EP and AR is 97.5 °C. When SiO2 NPs,
SiO2–TETA NPs, or TETA–SiO2@PDVB
JPs is used as the compatibilizer of AR/EP composites, the Tg difference of EP and AR is 85.5, 77.5, or
91.5 °C, respectively. Because of the compatibilization of SiO2 and SiO2–TETA, the Tg values of the AR phase and EP phase are close to each other
gradually. However, the Tg difference
of EP and AR increases on the contrary, in AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB. The reason is that the desorption energy of NPs is
20 times lower than that of JPs from the interface of an immiscible
polymer blend.36 The high desorption energy
of JPs prevents them from moving out of the interface of AR/EP. The
movement of the EP chain segment becomes difficult, so the Tg of EP rises up obviously.

Table 1 Tg of
AR/EP Composites
samples	Tg (°C) of AR	Tg (°C) of EP	Tg difference (°C)	
AR/EP	65	162.5	97.5	
AR/EP/SiO2	75	160.5	85.5	
AR/EP/SiO2–TETA	72.5	150	77.5	
AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB	68	159.5	91.5	
Figure 8a shows
tan δ as a function of temperature measured by a dynamic mechanical
analyzer (DMA), and its peak is taken as Tg. All of the samples show a short peak corresponding to the glass
transition of the AR phase in 70 °C and a high peak corresponding
to the glass transition of the EP phase. It is worth noting that AR/EP/SiO2–TETA composites show an α-relaxation peak and
a β-relaxation peak. On the one hand, SiO2–TETA
NPs reacted with EP originate secondary relaxation. On the other hand,
SiO2–TETA NPs have compatibilization on AR/EP composites.
Because of the high desorption energy, the Tg value of AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB is higher
than that of AR/EP/SiO2–TETA. Loss modulus can also
be used to characterize Tg. Figure 8b shows that the loss modulus
values of the AR and EP are close to each other in the presence of
NPs and JPs. This indicates that SiO2 NPs, SiO2–TETA NPs, and TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs improve
compatibility of AR and EP.

(b) loss modulus.

2.7 Mechanical
Property of AR/EP Composites
Impact strength and tensile
tests are performed to evaluate the
toughening and reinforcing effects of the incorporated NPs and JPs.
NPs and JPs can change the phase domain size and phase domain distribution
and also improve the mechanical properties of AR/EP composites. The
results are shown in Figure 9. The impact strength of AR/EP composites is 6.12 kJ/m2 (Figure 9a).
They increase to 7.55, 10.98, 15.21 kJ/m2, respectively,
when 2 wt % SiO2 NPs, SiO2–TETA NPs,
and TETA–SiO2@PDVB are added. Owing to the anisotropic
property of JPs, the impact strength of AR/EP composites with 3 wt
% of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs becomes 16.03 kJ/m2, which is 32.2% higher than that of pure EP. The similar polar of
AR and EP benefits their blending. However, the uniform dispersed
phase is difficult to finish cavitating and blunting at the same time;
so it is very important to broaden the AR phase domain distribution.
If SiO2 NPs are added, the AR phase domain distribution
becomes broad and SiO2 NPs can blunt the crack tip. However,
the poor interfacial adhesion of SiO2 NPs induces stress
concentration, which results in the decline of impact strength. Modified
SiO2–TETA NPs can form a covalent bond with EP,
bridge, and pin the crack line. Therefore, the toughness of AR/EP/SiO2–TETA composites is higher than that of AR/EP/SiO2 composites. When TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs added
into AR/EP composites, the interface between AR and EP is blurred,
and the compatibility of the two phases is obviously improved, so
the impact strength is improved significantly. In addition, the rive
effect of JPs anchored at the interface of AR and EP prevents crack
propagation and transmits impact force effectively. This firm attachment
at interfaces may lead to advanced stabilizing properties in dispersions
and improves the toughness of composites. The agglomeration of access
NPs and JPs will lead to the poor mechanical properties. Figure 9b shows the tensile
test of AR/EP composites with different contents of NPs and JPs. Results
show that the tensile strength of the AP/EP composites is 46.80 MPa.
Both NPs and JPs can increase the tensile strength of AR/EP composites
obviously. The difference is that the tensile strength of the AR/EP
composite with isotropic NPs increases first and then decreases because
of the agglomeration of NPs, especially unmodified SiO2 NPs. The tensile strength of AR/EP composites with anisotropic JPs
increases most quickly among three solid particles and reaches 63.12
MPa because of the interaction between TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs and AR/EP. However, unlike EP toughened by rubber, incorporation
of NPs and JPs into the AR/EP composites can toughen AR/EP composites
without sacrificing their stiffness.

of AR/EP composites.

3 Conclusions
The SiO2@PDVB
JPs are modified with TETA, and the obtained
anisotropic TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs are used as the compatibilizer
of AR/EP composites. TETA grafted onto the SiO2 lobe can
react with epoxy groups of EP, which results in the TETA–SiO2 lobe being embedded in the EP phase and the PDVB lobe being
pushed toward the AR phase. The TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs
anchored at the interface of AR and EP increase their interfacial
adhesion, decrease the domain phase size and distribution of dispersed
AR, and improve the compatibility of AR/EP composites. The compatibilization
of NPs is realized by the cavitation and blunting of different scaled
AR phase domain distributions and that of JPs is realized by the strong
interfacial force originated by JPs. Moreover, the desorption energy
of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs is higher than that of TETA–SiO2, and so the glass transition temperature (Tg) of AR/EP/JP composites is higher than that of AR/EP/NP
composites. The strong interfacial adhesion and high desorption energy
endow TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs with a toughening effect
and enhancing effect. The impact strength and the tensile strength
of AR/EP/JP composites are 16.03 kJ/m2 and 63.12 MPa, which
are 9.91 kJ/m2 and 16.32 MPa higher than those of AR/EP
composites, respectively. JPs used in the thermosetting EP is benefit
to its toughening study and the new anisotropic Janus compatibilizer.

(TEOS) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent.

4.2 Synthesis of SiO2 NPs
Anhydrous ethanol
(200 mL) and 15 mL of ammonia (28 wt %) were mixed
in a 250 mL of flask under stirring at ambient temperatures for 1
h. Then, 6 mL of TEOS was added into the mixture of ethanol and ammonia.
The reaction was lasted for 24 h. Finally, the product was centrifuged
and washed with water and anhydrous ethanol several times. The SiO2 NPs with a diameter of 50–100 nm were obtained after
freeze-drying. The SiO2 NPs with different sizes could
be obtained by changing the ratio of ethanol to water.

4.3 Synthesis of SiO2@PDVB JPs
JPs were prepared
by seed emulsion polymerization according to the
literature.24

4.4 Surface
Modification of the SiO2 Lobe in SiO2@PDVB JPs
First, the surface of
the SiO2 lobe in SiO2@PDVB JPs was activated
by H2O2 and HCl. As a result, the content of
activated silicon hydroxyl was 17.86 OH/nm2, which was
36.41% higher than that of the original SiO2@PDVB JPs.
Then, 2.0 g of activated SiO2@PDVB JPs was dispersed in
20.0 g of dimethylbenzene in 150 mL flask under ultrasonication. Then,
10.0 g of TETA and 2.5 g of 4 A zeolite were added. The flask was
heated to 210 °C and maintained for 24 h. After JPs were washed
with anhydrous ethanol and freeze-dried, the product of TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs was obtained. The SiO2–TETA NPs
were obtained by the same method.

4.5 Preparation
of AR/EP Composites
The
blends of AR/EP (10/100, w/w) containing 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 wt % TETA–SiO2/PDVB were mixed at a temperature of 120 °C for 3 h.
Next, the cross-linking agent of EP (DDM, 25 wt % to EP) was added
into the previous mixture. After being stirred for 3 min, the mixture
was poured into a preheated mold. The mold was put into an oven of
120 °C for 2 h and then heated to 160 °C and maintained
for 2 h. After the mold was cooled to room temperature, the composites
of AR/EP/TETA–SiO2@PDVB were gained. The AR/EP/SiO2 and the AR/EP/TETA–SiO2 as the control
were obtained using the same method.

4.6 Characterization
The morphology of
JPs and the brittle fracture surfaces of polymer blends were observed
with a JSM-7500F scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan)
after the scanned surfaces were vacuum-sputtered with platinum at
an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of the unmodified and modified TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs were recorded on a Nicolet-5700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo
Nicolet, USA) using KBr pellets. The bonding energy was characterized
by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250, VG Ltd.,
USA). The thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Q50, USA) was utilized
to analyze the thermostability of SiO2@PDVB JPs and TETA–SiO2@PDVB JPs and to determine the amount of TETA on SiO2@PDVB JPs. Impact performance of composites was tested with an impact
strength tester (ZBC8501-C, MTS, Shanghai, China) according to GB/T1043.1
with the method of a simple support beam, and the pendulum energy
is 25 J. The specimens were molded in the form of rectangular strips
with the dimensions of 80 mm × 10 mm × 4 mm. Each result
was collected as an average value of five samples. The modulus and
glass transition temperature (Tg) of the
composites are measured by a DMA (TA Q800 DMA, VG Co., Ltd., USA)
with the loading mode of double cantilever bending at the frequency
of 1 Hz and at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Tensile tests were
performed using an LLOYD LR5K Tester with a 5 kN load cell at a crosshead
speed of 5 mm/min. The specimens were molded in the form of rectangular
strips with the dimensions of 80 mm × 10 mm × 4 mm. Each
result was collected as an average value of five samples.
