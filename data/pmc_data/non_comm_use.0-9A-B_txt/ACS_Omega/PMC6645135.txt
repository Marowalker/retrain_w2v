The increases in the volumes of electronic
waste have become an
aggravating environmental, economic, and social health issue in recent
times. This study investigates the conversion of e-waste plastics
into hydrocarbon oils via noncatalytic thermal transformation followed
by an in-depth characterization of these oils using diverse analytical
techniques such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS),
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In particular, NMR spectroscopy is a
key analytical tool utilized in this study to gain a comprehensive
insight into the chemical nature of the resultant oils along with
a semiquantitative investigation of the changes in their composition
over a temperature range of 800–1200 °C. The one-dimensional
(1D) 1H and two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single-quantum
correlation spectra were acquired for the oils, wherein the 2D NMR
spectrum provided improved resolution of peaks to address the overlaps
encountered in the 1D spectrum. The experimental results obtained
from GC–MS, FTIR spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy were found
to align well with each other. The oils produced in this study have
a high calorific value of 38.27 MJ/kg and thus may find use in several
applications. A detailed mechanism for the thermal degradation of
styrene acrylonitrile plastics and the formation of major products
is elucidated in this study.

==== Body
1 Introduction
e-Waste has been growing
at a dramatic rate in the last two decades
and has been regarded as an exacerbating environmental and economic
problem around the world for a long time. Globally, generation of
e-waste is forecasted to reach a volume of around 50 million metric
tons in 2018, which is roughly 1.5 times as high as the volume of
the e-waste generated in 2010.1 In 2014,
Australia alone produced around 468 000 metric tons of e-waste.2 In another study, in the same year, the amount
of e-waste disposed of in Australia has been reported to be ∼25
kg per person.3 All the electronic devices
and equipment have a finite useful lifetime after which they are considered
as e-waste. e-Waste is mainly constituted of end-of-life electronics
such as computers, TVs, printers, mobile phones, washing machines,
air conditioners, and refrigerators.4 The
life span of such devices has been shortened drastically in the recent
past because of the frequent advent of newer, faster, and smarter
devices facilitated by rapid advancements in the technology.1,5 e-Waste is a very complex type of waste and contains a large variety
of precious metals, toxic metals, and other useful materials. If not
recycled properly, the toxic components from the e-waste can severely
degrade the environment and may exert biological effects on both plants
and animals because of the leaching of these toxic elements into the
soil, crops, groundwater, and rivers.6,7 Conversely,
the recycling of e-waste by adopting proper techniques can provide
a range of economic and environmental benefits. Various valuable materials
can be extracted from the e-waste through recycling, which can be
used in the manufacturing of new products, effectively reducing the
consumption of finite primary resources.1 Majority of the research on e-waste recycling has been focused on
the extraction of highly valuable elements such as precious metals
for economic benefits.8 Plastics being
less valuable have generally been dumped into landfills or incinerators,
after initial dismantling, which are not environment-friendly options
because of the toxic emissions and loss of valuable resources.5,9

Typically, plastics take up a large proportion of e-waste,
and
their content in different types of e-wastes has been reported to
be in the range of 10–30%.8 In the
case of printers, plastics account for almost a quarter of the total
weight of the printers. The major different types of plastics found
in e-waste are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), styrene acrylonitrile
(SAN), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene, polycarbonate blends, low-density
polyethylene, and polyurethane foam.10 Various
attempts have been made by researchers to utilize these e-waste plastics
in different applications. Onwudili and Williams11 used supercritical water to degrade two of the most commonly
used e-waste plastics, brominated ABS and brominated high impact polystyrene
(Br-HIPS), into oils, solid residue, and gases. Incineration has also
been employed as a way to generate energy from the e-waste plastics;
however, it can be potentially very harmful to the environment because
of the toxic emissions.12 These plastics
have also been utilized as the filling materials alongside quartz
sand and gravel to obtain a polymer concrete.13 The study found that the mechanical properties of the concrete were
not negatively affected for a composition of plastics of up to 5%.
Acomb et al.14 used the e-waste plastics
(ABS and HIPS) to produce hydrogen gas via gasification using a two-stage
reaction system.

A styrene-based polymer accounts for a significant
part (∼55%)
of the e-waste plastics and needs a special attention to deal with
them.15 Although there has been considerable
work done on converting waste plastics to hydrocarbon oils, there
is still an existing knowledge gap with regard to converting complex
e-waste plastics to high calorific value oils and more so on understanding
the chemical nature of the oils.16−21 In the present study, we intend to contribute in bridging this gap.
We have performed noncatalytic thermal transformation of SAN plastics,
obtained from the end-of-life printers, to produce hydrocarbon oils
between 800 and 1200 °C and an in-depth study of the chemical
composition of the oils through 1H and two-dimensional
(2D) heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Fluorescence Analyses
According
to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, the SAN plastics had an ash
content of 2.56% at 815 °C. The composition of different elements
in the ash (reported in the form of oxides) is shown in Table 1. The XRF data reveal that the
major elements present in the ash are Si, Mg, Al, and Fe. The XRF
data were also used to calculate the alkali index (AI) of the ash
obtained from the SAN plastics. AI is a very important parameter in
the gasification studies of carbonaceous materials and is defined
as (eq 1) the sum of
the fractions of the basic oxides (CaO, MgO, K2O, Na2O, and Fe2O3) in the ash to the mass
fraction of the acidic and amphoteric compounds (Al2O3 and SiO2) multiplied by the ash content of the
material.22,23 This index is used to describe the overall
influence of catalytically active species in the ash. The AI for the
ash produced from the SAN plastics was calculated to be 1.45. This
value can be used to compare the gasification of SAN with other carbonaceous
materials. A higher AI means a higher gasification reactivity for
the carbonaceous material. In a study conducted by Porada et al.,24 the AI value for the bituminous Janina coal
was found to be 2.53. 1

Na2O	0.53	
Next,
transformation experiments were performed under isothermal
conditions at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C to observe the changes in
the composition of these oils produced at different temperatures.
The main products of the thermal transformation of SAN plastics were
oils, gases, and solid residue. The oils generated in the process
were trapped using dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent.

The
color of the solvent turned to reddish black after the emissions
from the thermal transformation interacted and dissolved in it. The
impinger assembly containing the solvent with the trapped oils was
disconnected from the furnace outlet after 5 min as the gas emissions
had stopped indicating that the SAN sample had completely degraded.
After the removal of the particulate solid matter from the trapped
oils using a centrifuge, the oils exhibited different colors as shown
in Figure 1. The oils
obtained at 800 °C had a brownish color, and the oils obtained
at 1000 and 1200 °C showed dark black colors (in CDCl3 solvent). Similar colors have been widely reported in various studies
involving the conversion of plastics to hydrocarbon oils.25,26 The composition and the chemical nature of the oils produced were
evaluated using analytical tools such as GC–MS, attenuated
total reflectance (ATR)–FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy.

at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C.

2.2 GC–MS Analyses
The GC–MS
chromatograms of the resultant oils are as represented in Figure 2. The peaks in the
spectra correspond to various aromatic hydrocarbons. Although more
than 20 different aromatic compounds were detected in the first 40
min of the GC–MS spectra acquisition, we will be discussing
only the compounds that had an area % of more than 0.18. The area
% of the peak for a compound was correlated with the percentage of
that compound in the oil. The major aromatic hydrocarbons detected
in these spectra were found to be toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene,
α-methylstyrene, phenol, 1-propynylbenzene, naphthalene, 2-methylnephthalene,
1-methylnaphthalene, biphenyl, acenaphthylene, fluorene, and anthracene.
The data obtained from the chromatograms were used to calculate the
percentage of these aromatic hydrocarbons in DCM and the variation
in the composition at different temperatures. Among all these aromatic
hydrocarbons, toluene and styrene were the two most dominant hydrocarbons.
It is evident from Figures 2 and 3 that the toluene and ethylbenzene
content (%) in the oils decreased quite dramatically with the increase
in the temperature of thermal transformation. However, the content
(%) of naphthalene, biphenyl, and anthracene in the oils increased
with the increase in temperature. This trend and the content of other
aromatic hydrocarbons can also be observed from the data in Table 2.

transformation of SAN plastics at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C.

2.3 Mechanism
of the Thermal Degradation of the
SAN Plastics and Major Products Formation
SAN is a styrene-based
copolymer, and its degradation is likely to be similar to the PS degradation.
When SAN plastics undergo a heat treatment at the temperatures employed
in this study, the expected degradation products included various
hydrocarbons, oligomers, different-sized carbon rings and chains,
and a mixture of gases such as CH4, H2, CO,
and CO2. When the thermal energy is greater than the energy
barrier of a reaction and the bond energy of a bond, the bond will
break, resulting in chain scission. Depending on the temperature,
the bonds can dissociate in different ways to form different products.
Generally, single bonds are the easiest to break as compared to double
bonds, triple bonds, and aromatic rings. Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate
the possible schemes for the decomposition of SAN into various aromatic
hydrocarbons such as toluene (C7H8), styrene
(C8H8), and naphthalene (C10H8). These three compounds were the major components in the
hydrocarbon oil mixture as demonstrated by the GC–MS data.
Naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
and has the highest concentration among the PAHs generated in the
present study. There were various other PAHs such as anthracene, fluorene,
and so forth that were generated in smaller quantities.

Figure 4 Mechanism of
SAN degradation into styrene and naphthalene.

Figure 5 Mechanism of thermal degradation of SAN into toluene.

Hydrocarbons such as acetylene (C2H2) are
also expected and reported to be some of the degradation products
of SAN plastics and play an important role toward the formation of
PAHs through a hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism.27 The HACA mechanism leads to the formation of
additional aromatic rings via ring closures and has been widely reported
in the literature.28−30 The mechanism in Figure 4 accounts for the formation of styrene and
naphthalene. A noncatalyzed thermal degradation generally takes places
via a free-radical mechanism. At first, the C–C bond scission
in the SAN polymer chain leads to the formation of two chains with
a free radical at one end. Further to that, a β scission takes
place to form a styrene molecule and another free-radical chain. Styrene
was one of the major degradation products and worked as a precursor
toward the formation of PAHs. Consequently, there is a high probability
of the conversion of styrene into phenylacetylene by hydrogen elimination.27,31 This step is likely to be followed by the addition of an acetylene
molecule to phenylacetylene, which ultimately yields naphthalene.28 Similarly, Figure 5 represents the scheme for the generation
of toluene. The generation of toluene from the styrene-based polymer
has been reported in the literature.32 The
scheme displayed here involves hydrogenation, β chain scission,
and molecular rearrangement reactions. The mechanisms shown in this
study are some of the probable mechanisms for the thermal degradation
of SAN copolymers; however, as the thermal degradation results from
a number of competing decomposition reactions, it is difficult to
predict the real mechanism underlying the degradation.33

2.4 FTIR Analyses
FTIR spectroscopy is
a very important characterization technique used to identify various
functional groups present in a sample. The ATR–FTIR spectra
obtained for the oils generated from SAN plastics at 800, 1000, and
1200 °C and for DCM are shown in Figure 6. The spectra at all the three temperatures
have similar peaks because of the presence of essentially the same
functional groups in the oils. The strong peaks in the range of 680–760
cm–1 for DCM are due to the C–Cl stretch.
The absence of this band in the spectra for oils indicated that all
the DCM had evaporated by heating the oils to 45 °C before the
ATR–FTIR spectra were acquired for these samples. The peaks
observed in the spectra for oils at ∼3050 cm–1 can be attributed to alkene stretching. The band in the region 3250–3420
cm–1 is present only in the 800 °C sample and
accounts for the −OH stretch in alcohols and phenols. The peak
at 1222 cm–1 implies the presence of C≡C
stretching vibrations, which may have originated from the C≡C
bond in 1-propynylbenzene. The wide overtone bands between 1760 and
1990 cm–1 indicate the substituted benzene rings.
These bands are more pronounced for the 1200 °C sample. The sharp
peak at 1593 cm–1 is attributed to the benzene ring
stretching in aromatic compounds. Additionally, the band at 1511 cm–1, for the 800 °C sample, also indicates the benzene
ring stretching in aromatic compounds. The bands in the range 1400–1480
cm–1 represent the CH2 scissor vibrations
and CH3 antisymmetric deformation in aliphatic compounds.
According to GC–MS analysis, many aromatic compounds showed
the presence of these groups attached with the polycyclic carbon rings.

Figure 6 ATR–FTIR
spectra of DCM and the oils produced during the
thermal transformation of SAN plastics at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C.

The bands in the range of 1015–1220
cm–1 may be arising because of the C–O stretch
in the C–OH
bond present in phenol. These bands are more pronounced at a lower
temperature, and the same can be observed through the GC–MS
data, which show that the phenol content decreased with the increase
in thermal transformation temperatures. The peak in the region 950–1000
cm–1 is coming from =CH out-of-plane vibrations
from the CH=CH2 group present in vinyl compounds
such as styrene and α-methylstyrene. The sharp bands between
690 and 770 cm–1 imply the presence of CH out-of-plane
deformation in monosubstituted benzenes. The sharp peak at 690 cm–1 can be assigned to OH out-of-plane deformation in
phenols. The results from GC–MS and ATR–FTIR analyses
are matching and thus corroborate each other.

2.5 NMR Analyses
NMR spectroscopy is
a powerful tool for determining the chemical nature of hydrocarbon
oils, including functional groups and molecular bonding. As is evident
from the GC–MS results, the hydrocarbon oils are a mixture
of several compounds, which makes the unequivocal identification of
compounds in NMR very challenging. However, using a highly sensitive
2D NMR technique, that is, HSQC spectroscopy, it is possible to overcome
some of the challenges and to characterize the oils in further detail.
The HSQC spectra essentially depicts the correlation (direct bonding)
between the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, which enables
us to understand the interaction between carbon and hydrogen within
the hydrocarbon oils. In the present spectra, it is also possible
to distinguish the CH2 groups from the CH and CH3 groups, wherein the CH2 groups are marked in red color
compared to the blue color for the CH and CH3 groups. Although
the aliphatic and aromatic content of the oils was found to vary with
temperature, it was observed that qualitatively the spectra did not
change much, and thus, the HSQC NMR spectra for oils produced at 800
°C were utilized as a representative spectrum for the present
analyses. Figure 7 shows
the HSQC spectra for the oil produced at 800 °C. The results
of the semiquantitative analyses performed on the 1H spectra
of oils produced at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C are presented after
the HSQC NMR analyses. The 1H NMR spectra for the oils
are depicted in Figure 8. The sharp peaks at a chemical shift of 7.26 ppm in the 1H spectra and at a chemical shift of 77.2 ppm in the 13C spectra (as shown in HSQC) represent deuterochloroform (CDCl3), which has been used as a solvent for NMR analyses.

of the hydrocarbon oil produced at 800 °C.

Figure 8 1H NMR spectra of oils produced from the noncatalytic
single-step transformation of SAN plastics at 800, 1000, and 1200
°C.

The HSQC NMR spectra depict four
major regions of correlation between 1H and 13C, which will be labeled as A, B, C, and
D for the present analyses. Region A (0.84–3.01 1H and 11–44 ppm in 13C) comprises signals mainly
from the CH3 groups and some from the CH2 groups.
The correlation region between 0.89 and 1.83 in 1H and
14.1–31.5 ppm in 13C may be attributed to CH3 and CH2 groups from the short- and long-chain
aliphatic compounds, respectively. For example, the CH2 correlation at ∼29 ppm in 13C and 1.34 ppm in 1H can be due to the presence of compounds such as methyl hexane.
Furthermore, the correlation region at ∼21 ppm in 13C and ∼2.4 ppm in 1H can be attributed to the CH3 groups attached to the aromatic rings and may represent compounds
such as toluene.34−39 Region B (3.37–4.43 in 1H and 34.5–42.1
ppm in 13C) comprises predominantly CH2 groups,
more specifically CH2 groups in the vicinity of aromatic/phenyl
rings. It is possible that the CH2 groups from compounds
such as fluorene and diphenylmethane exhibit their signature in this
region.40−45 Region C (5.06–5.95 in 1H and 110–116 ppm
in 13C) can be said to be characteristic of the =CH2 groups from compounds such as styrene or methyl styrene.
Region D (6.4–9.5 in 1H and 109–151 ppm in 13C) largely comprises peaks from the aromatic CH groups. Several
compounds such as toluene, styrene, methyl styrene, naphthalene, and
fluorene exhibit the peaks from the aromatic CH groups in this region,
and hence, there is a considerable overlap of peaks.39,46,47

For semiquantitative analyses,
each 1H spectrum was
integrated between identical chemical shifts, that is, 0–9.08
ppm, and the total integral was calibrated as 100. The aromatic content
was then determined by integrating the area between the 6.59 and 9.08
ppm chemical shift. The aromatic content of the oils produced at 800,
1000, and 1200 °C was calculated to be 80.5, 94.1, and 88.74%,
respectively. It thus indicates that the aromatic content in the oils
increased with an increase in temperature from 800 to 1000 °C;
however, a further increase in the temperature to 1200 °C resulted
in a drop in the aromatic content. This drop may be attributed to
the decomposition of aromatic compounds to smaller and low-molecular-weight
compounds at such high temperatures, an observation which has been
noted in some of our previous research as well.33 Overall, it can be said that the results from GC–MS
and NMR spectroscopies align very well and reinforce each other.

Furthermore, despite being a noncatalytic process, the presence
of methoxy groups was not detected in the oils, which is highly advantageous
as it might lessen the need for intensive downstream upgrading processes.

2.6 Gross Calorific Value
According to
the findings of 1H NMR spectroscopy, the oils produced
at 1000 °C had the highest aromatic content among the three oil
samples. The aromatic content started to decrease because of the thermal
transformation performed at temperatures higher than 1000 °C.
The experimental calorific value for the oil sample derived from the
SAN plastics at a thermal transformation temperature of 1000 °C
was found to be 38.27 MJ/kg, which can be considered high from the
energy utilization point of view. Although this oil has a significantly
higher aromatic content, its calorific value is very close to the
commercial fuel-grade criteria for gasoline (43.4–46.5 MJ/kg),
kerosene (43.0–46.2 MJ/kg), and diesel (42.8–45.8 MJ/kg).48,49 The heating values obtained by Ahmad et al.50 for the aliphatic chain hydrocarbon-based plastics HDPE and PP were
30.6 and 35.5 MJ/kg, respectively. Szabo et al.51 reported the calorific value of 34.4 MJ/kg for the oils
produced by the thermal decomposition of the polymethylmethacrylate–ABS
waste. In another study, the gross calorific value for the bio-oil
produced from rice straw was found to be 13.41 MJ/kg.52 Some of these gross calorific values are significantly
lower as compared to the values obtained in the present study and
thus indicate that SAN plastics may serve as a potential feedstock
material for fuel generation.

3 Conclusions
NMR [one-dimensional (1D) and 2D] and GC–MS techniques were
utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the chemical nature
of hydrocarbon oils produced by the noncatalytic thermal transformation
of SAN plastics from end-of-life printers between 800 and 1200 °C.
Toluene and styrene were the two most dominant compounds present in
the oils. The toluene and ethylbenzene content (%) in the oils decreased
with the increase in the temperature of thermal transformation; however,
the content of naphthalene, biphenyl, and anthracene increased with
the increase in temperature. NMR and GC–MS analyses complement
each other, thus reinforcing the validity of the results presented
in this study. FTIR analyses of the oils too concurred these results.
The XRF data for the SAN plastics were used to estimate the AI, which
is a very important parameter in the gasification studies of carbonaceous
materials. The AI of SAN plastics was calculated to be 1.45. Additionally,
the gross calorific value for the oil sample obtained at a thermal
transformation temperature of 1000 °C was found to be 38.27 MJ/kg.
The results obtained in the present study suggest that the waste SAN
plastics can potentially be used as a feedstock for producing hydrocarbon
oils, which could be blended with commercial grade fuels after suitable
upgrading. This will contribute to address the problems associated
with the safe disposal of these end-of-life plastics and provide alternative
avenues for their diversion from landfill.

4 Materials
and Methodology
The plastics retrieved from the end-of-life
printers were supplied
by an electronic waste management company named TES ANZ. The plastics
were first sorted out based on the color and physical appearance.
Following that, an FTIR spectrum was acquired for these plastics and
has been reported in our earlier published work.53 SAN was found to be the dominant plastic in the mixture
and was selected to be used in this study. The as-received SAN plastics
were pulverized using CryoMill (Retsch Mixer Mill). The ash composition
of SAN plastics was investigated with the help of XRF spectroscopy
and is shown in Table 1. The XRF data were used to calculate the AI of the SAN plastics.
For this study, all percentages are presented as weight %, unless
specified otherwise.

The thermal transformation experiments
were performed at isothermal
conditions at the temperatures 800, 1000, and 1200 °C. Argon
gas was used at a flow rate of 1 L/min to create and maintain an inert
atmosphere inside the horizontal tubular furnace, which was used to
conduct these thermal transformation experiments. The schematic and
the setup of the furnace are described in detail in our earlier publication.54 An alumina crucible with 2 g of SAN plastic
sample was inserted in the preheated furnace. The emissions generated,
during the transformation of these plastics in the furnace, were transferred
to an impinger, which was linked to the gas outlet of the furnace.
The impinger was filled with 15 mL of DCM, which was used as an organic
solvent to trap the hydrocarbons generated during the thermal transformation
of SAN plastics. The impinger was disconnected from the gas outlet
of the furnace after an interval of 5 min as the plastics in the furnace
had completely decomposed and gas emission had stopped. The solvent
and hydrocarbon mixtures thus obtained from the impinger were transferred
to 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes. An HERMLE Z206A centrifuge (Hermle
Labortechnik GmbH) was employed to centrifuge these oil-bearing solvents
to remove the suspended particulate matter, for 30 min.

At all
the temperatures used in the present study, the yield of
solid carbonaceous residue was found to be similar, at ∼5%.
This solid residue was used in metallurgical and energy storage applications
in our earlier published works.53,55 After suitable additional
treatments, it can be used in a variety of other value-added applications
such as high-performance carbon anode in alkali-ion batteries, carbon
capture and storage, and gas separation.

The solvents obtained
after the removal of the particulates were
analyzed by GC–MS. A Thermo FOCUS DSQ II GC–MS (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) instrument equipped with a split/splitless
heated GC inlet and a TriPlus autosampler was employed to perform
the GC–MS analysis. The system was operated in the electron
impact mode for all the analyses and was used to identify the unknown
components trapped in the DCM solvent. A Thermo TR-50MS 60 m column
with an inner diameter of 0.25 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 μm
was installed in the split inlet of the GC with an SGE Split Focus
liner. High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant
flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The GC inlet was maintained at a temperature
of 305 °C and the ion source of the MS at 200 °C. Heptane
was used as a syringe wash in the autosampler. The centrifuged samples
were diluted 10 times, and 1 μL of the diluted sample was injected
into the preheated GC inlet at a split ratio of 50:1. The initial
temperature of the oven was held at 45 °C for 30 s before it
was increased to 310 °C, at a rate of 5 °C/min, where it
was held for an additional 12 min. Additionally, the temperature of
the GC transfer line was maintained at 315 °C throughout the
run. The m/z values between 45 and
550 were scanned by a mass spectrometer at a rate of 3.5 scans/s.
To protect the filament, the mass spectrometer was switched off during
the first 6.5 min of the run. The components present in the solvent
were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the ones stored
in the Wiley 9/NIST 2011 Mass Spectral Library.

Prior to FTIR
and NMR spectroscopies, the DCM solvent (boiling
point, 40 °C) from the oil samples was evaporated by heating
the mixtures up to 45 °C. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(PerkinElmer Spotlight 400 FTIR) fitted with an ATR accessory was
used for this analysis. The spectra were recorded in the wavenumber
range of 4000–650 cm–1 and were studied to
identify the various characteristic functional groups present in the
oils.

NMR spectroscopy was performed to determine the chemical
nature
of hydrocarbon oils. The oil samples obtained after DCM evaporation
were dissolved in deuterochloroform (CDCl3, 99.8%), which
contained silver foil as a stabilizer. 1D 1H and 2D HSQC
NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III Cryo NMR spectrometer
operating at 600 MHz using 5 mm sample tubes. Bruker TopSpin 3.5 software
was used for the processing of the NMR spectra.

Lastly, the
oil samples were analyzed for the gross calorific values
(MJ/kg) using the Parr 6400 calorimeter by the ASTM D240 test method.
