Microwave–ultrasound-assisted
facile synthesis of a dumbbell-
and flower-shaped potato starch phosphate (PSP) polymer, hereafter
PSP, was carried out by cross-linking the hydroxyl groups of native
potato starch (NPS) using phosphoryl chloride as a cross-linking agent.
Structural and morphological analysis manifested the successful formation
of the dumbbell- and flower-shaped PSP biosorbent with enhanced specific
surface area and thermal stability. Viscoelastic behavior of NPS and
PSP suggested increased rigidity in PSP, which helped the material
to store more deformation energy in an elastic manner. The synthesized
PSP biosorbent material was successfully tested for efficient and
quick uptake of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions from aqueous
medium under competitive and noncompetitive batch conditions with qm values of 130.54, 106.25, 91.84, and 51.38
mg g–1, respectively. The adsorption selectivity
was in consonance with Pearson’s hard and soft acids and bases
(HSAB) theory in addition to their order of hydrated radius. Adsorption
of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) followed a second-order kinetics
and the adsorption data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model.
Quantum computations using density functional theory (DFT) further
supported the experimental adsorption selectivity, Zn(II) > Pb(II)
> Cd(II) > Hg(II), in terms of metal–oxygen binding energy
measurements. What was more intriguing about PSP was its reusability
over multiple adsorption cycles by treating the metal(II)-complexed
PSP with 0.1 M HCl without any appreciable loss of its adsorption
capacity.

1 Introduction
We
will begin with a quote of W.H. Auden, a British poet who once
said “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water”
speaking the ultimate importance of water. Our water bodies are under
tremendous pollution stress through anthropogenic agents and unregulated
human interference. Currently, large quantities of water containing
heavy metals are being discharged into water streams as a result of
various industrial, agricultural, and human activities. Arsenic, cadmium,
lead, copper, mercury, nickel, chromium, zinc, etc. are some of the
heavy metals most commonly found in wastewater. Unlike organic contaminants,
heavy metals persist in aquatic systems due to their higher solubility
and nonbiodegradable nature.1,2 Consumption of heavy-metal-contaminated
water is jeopardizing our state of well-being and kills more people
than a war or any other form of brutality. Still, we are not hopeless
against the ever-increasing threats to clean water.

A number
of physicochemical treatment methods have been used for
heavy metal removal, such as chemical precipitation,3 ultrafiltration,4 ion exchange,5−7 and adsorption.8−10 Among the various technologies developed over the
years for safe disposal of heavy metals, adsorption holds great promise
and represents an alternative treatment method due to its simplicity,
high adsorption capacity and selectivity, low cost, and minimal sludge
generation.11−14 Materials with a layered-type structure, such as layered metal sulfides
(LMS),15 metal(IV) phosphates,16 and layered double hydroxides (LDHs),17,18 offer a unique strategy for the effective capture of heavy metal
ions. LDHs are a class of two-dimensional layered materials containing
an exchangeable and charge-neutralizing interlayer anion.19 For decades, composites of LDHs are known, which
offer superior advantages such as thermal stability and high adsorption
capacity for the decontamination of heavy metals. Dinari et al. reported
a number of LDH-based composite adsorbent materials for the quick
removal of Cd(II) ions.17,18 In spite of the abundant
uses of commercially available adsorbents, such as porous silica,20 activated carbon,21 layered zirconium phosphate,16 etc.,
their application is somewhat restricted, mainly due to their low
selectivity and high cost. The biosorption method has received much
attention toward removal of heavy metals and is presently serving
as an alternative treatment technology, mainly due to its low cost,
metal selectivity, sustainability, nontoxicity, and high adsorption
efficiency.22,23 For this purpose, a number of
biosorbents have been tested and approved for the removal of toxic
metals from contaminated water, and among them, starch, alginate,
and chitosan display outstanding adsorption performance.24−27 Demey et al. recently reported a number of research works on biosorption
and are actively engaged in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous
systems.28−31 For example, in their recently reported research work, alginate-
and chitosan-based biosorbents were shown to exhibit superior sorption
capacity for Pb(II), Ni(II), and Hg(II) ions.28,29 The same research group in 2019 reported sorption of terbium (a
rare earth ion) in addition to Pb(II) ions by a low-cost torrefied
poplar-biomass-based sorbent and the sorption results demonstrated
better adsorption capacity.30

Starch
is the most abundant polysaccharide in nature with a number
of hydroxyl groups at its surface. Starch has excellent properties,
such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nontoxicity; therefore,
it finds use in drug delivery, tissue engineering, adsorption, and
others.32 Despite these applications, use
of native starch is somewhat restricted because of its low adsorption
performance and its tendency to retrograde.33 To overcome these challenges, native starch is modified by numerous
chemical strategies, such as cross-linking, grafting, oxidation, esterification,
and etherification. Chemical modification introduces new functionalities
in starch, such as carbonyl, acetyl, hydroxypropyl, and phosphate.32,33 Among these chemical modifications, cross-linking serves as an efficient
and most common strategy. Among diverse cross-linking agents, such
as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP),
epichlorohydrin (EPI), a mixture of adipic and acetic anhydrides,
a mixture of succinic anhydride and vinyl acetate, and phosphorus
oxychloride (POCl3), cross-linking with POCl3 involves esterification of surface hydroxyls resulting in anionic
starch phosphate esters.26,34−36 POCl3 is an efficient and fast-acting cross-linking agent,
which gives rise to starch phosphate at high pH values of ca. 10–11.32,33 Starch phosphate esters possess high viscosity and good adhesive
properties with enhanced metal-binding affinity over diverse pH regimes.
Cross-linking of native starch to improve the performance involves
homogeneous mixing of starch with cross-linking agents to permeate
the internal structure of starch. However, this homogeneous mixing
of starch with chemical reagents is difficult; therefore, more highly
efficient methods, such as ultrasound and microwave technology, have
recently shown great potential.37 Microwaves
are a type of electromagnetic wave with great potential to heat only
reactants, thus improving the contact between native starch and the
reagent.

Therefore, this study mainly focuses on the adsorption
of Zn(II),
Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions onto PSP. The effect of parameters,
such as contact time, solution pH, adsorbent dose, and temperature,
was studied to estimate various thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.
The metal ion selectivity and sorption mechanism were also ascertained
using experimental and DFT studies.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
dumbbell- and flower-shaped PSP was synthesized by cross-linking NPS
by phosphoryl chloride under alkaline conditions with microwave and
ultrasonic irradiation, as shown in Scheme 1. Under alkaline conditions, POCl3 undergoes hydrolysis to phosphoric acid, which then reacts with
starch molecules to develop a phosphate ester. Achmatowicz et al.
have investigated the hydrolytic conversion of POCl3 to
H3PO4.38 Indeed,
following the fast initial chloride substitution in POCl3 (K1 = 66 s–1), the
remaining two P–Cl bonds are rendered somewhat kinetically
less reactive (K2 = 3 × 10–3 s–1) and thermodynamically less stable leading
to the accumulation of phosphorodichloridic acid (POH·Cl2). However, the undesired accumulation of POH·Cl2 can be minimized either by increasing the water concentration
or by an increase in pH. The increase in pH shows a more pronounced
effect; therefore, we have selected pH = 11 for the successful cross-linking
of NPS granules.

POCl3 under Ultrasonic and Microwave Irradiation at Alkaline
pH
The cross-linking of starch
to form starch phosphate involves reactions
between C2 and C2/C3, between C6 and C6, or between C6 and C2/C3 of the sugar ring.37 These
interaction possibilities along with the structure of starch are shown
in Figure 1. We have
shown cross-linking exclusively between C6 and C6 of sugar chains because the C6 position seems to be sterically
less crowded and electronically rich enough to facilitate nucleophilic
substitution around the phosphorus center of the cross-linking agent.39

Figure 1 Structure of starch representing various possibilities
of phosphodiester
cross-linking along with possible interaction sites.

In view of the above facts and hydrolysis pattern of phosphoryl
chloride, we propose two mechanistic possibilities for the formation
of the phosphodiester linkage between two 6CH2OH groups
of starch chains: (a) initially, two consecutive nucleophilic substitution
reactions occur by 6CH2OH at the phosphorus center of phosphorodichloridic
acid, as shown in Figure S1b. After the
reaction has occurred, phosphorodichloridic acid starts to hydrolyze
to H3PO4 under alkaline pH. The same two-stage
substitution reaction occurs at the electrophilic phosphorus center
of H3PO4, as illustrated in Figure 2.

bond formation by two consecutive
nucleophilic addition–elimination-type reactions between orthophosphoric
acid and electronically rich 6CH2OH groups of native potato
starch.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopic analysis is carried
out for native starch, and cross-linked starch before and after adsorption
of Zn(II) ions to prove the chemical structure and to confirm metal
chelation. Figure 3a presents the FTIR spectra of NPS, PSP, and Zn(II)-complexed PSP.
All of these materials exhibited a similar pattern with additional
bands arising from cross-linking and zinc metal complexation. The
IR bands recorded at 3476, 2922, and 1631 cm–1 were
assigned to stretching of the O–H group, stretching of the
CH2 group, and O–H–O bending mode, respectively.
These three bands represent the characteristic bands of starch. In
general, vibration bands arising due to the presence of P=O
and C–O–P bonds appear at 1300–1150 cm–1 and 1050–970 cm–1, respectively.40 Consequently, in PSP and Zn(II)-complexed PSP,
we have recorded these two bands at 1266 and 1037 cm–1. In the case of Zn(II)-complexed PSP, we recorded a weak band at
608 cm–1, which mainly arises due to the presence
of Zn–O bonds. Similar results were obtained from DFT studies,
as shown in Figure S2. Therefore, we conclude
that IR studies provide some outlook about the incorporation of the
phosphodiester linkage and complexation of Zn(II) ions with PSP. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) is used to investigate the thermal stability and decomposition
pattern of NPS and PSP up to a temperature of 600 °C under an
air atmosphere. The results of TGA are shown in Figure 3b. TGA curves of NPS and PSP generally display
a well-defined two-step weight loss pattern. The first weight loss
could be assigned to the loss of adsorbed water molecules, which continued
up to 180 and 215 °C for native starch and cross-linked starch,
respectively. The maximum thermal degradation temperature (Tmax) for native starch and PSP is 305 and 327
°C, respectively. In both NPS and PSP, weight loss continued
up to 520 °C and could be assigned to the dehydration reaction
between the hydroxyl groups present in starch and cross-linked starch.
As is evident from Figure 3b, the second weight loss in native starch started at 180
°C, whereas the initial weight loss temperature for PSP is 215
°C. Moreover, the remaining weight of PSP is 34.38 wt % at 600
°C, which is higher than that of NPS (28.74). Therefore, TGA
results indicated better thermal stability of cross-linked starch,
which could mainly be attributed to stronger structures in the case
of PSP.

NPS, PSP, and Zn-complexed PSP, (b) thermogravimetric analysis of
NPS and PSP, indicating early decomposition of NPS than PSP, (c) X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis of NPS and PSP, indicative of A-type starch.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of NPS and PSP powder
samples are
presented in Figure 3c, and the results indicate the presence of characteristic diffraction
peaks for both the samples recorded at 2θ values of 15.37 and
22.18° along with a weak doublet at 17.72 and 18.91°.41 As inferred from Figure 3c, there is no significant change in the
diffractograms of the two samples; however, the results suggest only
a decrease in peak intensity after cross-linking the potato starch.
Briefly from XRD spectra, starches can be classified as A, B, and
C types.42 A-type starch has strong diffraction
peaks at about 15 and 23° and an unresolved doublet at around
17 and 18°. B-type starch gives characteristic peak at 5.6°
and a strong diffraction peak at 17.7° along with a few less
intense peaks at 15, 20, 22, and 24°. C-type starch is a mixture
of both A- and B-type polymorphs. Based on the above classification, Figure 3c demonstrates A-type
crystal patterns for NPS as well as PSP. Similar results have been
reported by Bahrami et al.41 and Lopez-Rubio
et al.43

To investigate the morphology
of the synthesized samples, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of NPS, PSP, and Zn(II)-complexed
PSP were recorded, as shown in Figure 4. The surface of native starch in Figure 4A was found to be nearly globular in shape with a smooth surface
and well-defined edges. However, SEM images of the cross-linked starch
polymer display dumbbell- and flower-shaped morphologies, with the
loss of their original smoothness and structural integrity, as depicted
in Figure 4B–E.
Some of the dumbbell-like particles agglomerate via further cross-linking
and/or intermolecular hydrogen bonding to develop into a flower-shaped
morphology, as depicted in Figure 4C. Upon a careful inspection of SEM micrographs of
PSP, one can see the presence of cavities or pores in the material.
Such visible pore characteristics of PSP may result from alkaline
action on starch granules, as has been reported earlier. After a careful
investigation of the surface morphology of zinc-complexed PSP over
a selected area, the SEM micrographs depict a change in the morphology,
indicating more surface roughness due to adsorption of zinc ions (Figure 4F,G). We have also
carried out energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of
a Zn-ion-complexed PSP sample, and the results (shown in Figure 4H–K) indicate
uniform distribution of Zn ions over the surface of PSP. Furthermore,
from the EDX spectrum (Figure 5L) of Zn-complexed PSP, it could be inferred that the material
is composed of only C, O, P, and Zn ions.

in comparison to NPS.

2.2 Viscoelastic
properties
Starch is
a granular material and swells in an aqueous system in which a gelatinization
granule acts as a microgel. During the process of gelatinization,
a part of starch goes into the solution.44 Cross-linking serves to suppress the dissolution/disintegration
of starch, thereby enhancing the granular nature of the gelatinized
starch suspension. Because of this, the rigidity modulus of the PSP
gel increases upon cross-linking and, at the same time, the swelling
capacity of the polymer decreases.45 It
is well established that at a higher starch concentration the swelling
will be lower, the suspension viscosity will be higher, and the overall
process will be governed by particle rigidity.46,47 Reduced swelling and higher viscosity in the case of PSP are indicative
of the fact that POCl3-treated granules have a more rigid
external surface with hard crusts formed on the outer surface of the
granules.48 The same can also be inferred
from the SEM images (Figure 4). It has been well established that in the case of POCl3-treated starch, the decrease in swelling with increased POCl3 concentration is larger in comparison to sodium trimetaphosphate
(STMP)- and epichlorohydrin (EPI)-treated starch.36 In general, hard spheres generate higher viscosities because
upon applying shear, the granules exude less water and, hence, more
will be the resistance to flow.49 Similar
results are obtained in the case of PSP. The results of steady shear
viscosity and shear stress as a function of shear rate for NPS and
PSP are shown in Figure 5a,b. It is evident that at a lower shear rate, the solution shows
non-Newtonian behavior, where the viscosity depends strongly on the
shear rate, thereby suggesting the presence of agglomerates for both
NPS and PSP gels. Additionally, in the case of PSP, zero shear viscosity
is higher in comparison to NPS, which also suggests the cross-linking
of PSP. Also for PSP, the non-Newtonian behavior is zero for higher
shear rates as well.

Oscillatory shear measurements were performed
for the study of viscoelastic behavior along with microstructural
analysis of the NPS and PSP dispersions at room temperature. Typical
results of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus
(G″) as a function of angular frequency (ω)
can be seen in Figure 5c. The storage modulus is an indication of a hydrogel’s ability
to store deformation energy in an elastic manner. This is directly
related to the extent of cross-linking. The higher the degree of cross-linking,
the lower will be the swelling and, consequently, the higher will
be the storage modulus. The binding state of a microstructure is indicative
of intermolecular or intraparticle forces within the bulk material.
To break the microstructure, one needs to apply a force greater than
the force holding the particles within the polymer matrix. When the
applied force is smaller than the intraparticle forces, G′ > G″, the material has some capacity
to store the deformation energy in an elastic manner. Conversely,
when the applied force is higher than the intraparticle forces (G′ < G″), the microstructure
collapses; therefore, the mechanical energy supplied to the material
disappears and the material attains a characteristic flow. Our results
of oscillatory measurements clearly reveal that in the case of PSP
as well as in NPS, G′ > G″ at all frequencies from 0 to 100 rad/s, which is indicative
of the fact that both the materials possess elastic behavior. Moreover,
in the case of PSP, the storage modulus is higher as compared to native
NPS over the entire frequency domain, which is again indicative of
higher rigidity and lower swelling for PSP. Figure 5d also describes lower swelling in the case
of PSP in comparison to NPS. From the rheological measurements, we
may conclude that upon successful cross-linking the swelling power
decreases and the overall rigidity increases, which helps the material
to store more deformation energy in an elastic manner by introducing
phosphodiester cross-links between various starch chains.

2.3 Batch Adsorption Studies
Batch adsorption
studies were carried out to validate the adsorption performance and
selectivity of the PSP biosorbent material for the selective removal
of zinc ions. It is very much desirable to carry out surface area
and pore size distribution (dV/dW) analysis for any adsorbent material.
We, therefore, carried out surface area analysis and pore size distribution
(dV/dW) (Figure S3) before optimizing and
calculating various batch experimental parameters for the adsorption
of heavy metals on PSP. The specific surface area calculated for NPS
and PSP was found to be 4.7 and 14.5 m2g–1, respectively. These results clearly indicate that upon cross-linking
there is a nearly 3-fold increase in specific surface area in the
case of PSP. This increase in specific surface area arises mainly
due to the presence of pores and cavities, as a consequence of alkali
treatment under microwave irradiation and subsequent cross-linking.50 In addition to the relatively higher specific
surface area, PSP also contains large macropores (pore size >50
nm)
to allow the metal cations to get adsorbed and diffuse effectively
into the pores of PSP. This study suggests that PSP can act as a suitable
candidate for adsorption processes similar to other starch-based adsorbent
materials.

2.3.1 Effect of Adsorbent Dose and Initial pH
Value
Adsorbent dose influences the adsorption capacity and,
in general, an increased adsorbent dose increases the adsorption capacity
due to the presence of more adsorption sites. Figure S4 displays the relationship between adsorption capacity
and PSP dose, and from Figure S4, we have
selected 25 mg as an optimum dose for our batch adsorption studies.
In addition to adsorbent dose, pH of the solution has a profound effect
on the removal of metal cations as it affects the speciation of metal
ions in the solution and the chemical state of binding sites on the
adsorbent, which eventually affects their affinity for target metal
ions. The effects of solution pH on the adsorption capacity of PSP
were investigated at pH values from 2 to 9 using a Britton–Robinson
universal buffer system, and the results are presented in Figure 6a.The results clearly
revealed that the interaction of the PSP biosorbent with Zn(II), Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions was strongly pH-dependent. Higher pH values
were not tested for metal ion uptake to avoid the formation of metal
hydroxides. At low solution pH, protonation of hydroxyl and phosphate
groups occurred, making the surface of PSP positively charged, as
inferred from the ζ-potential values shown in Figure 6b. Consequently, a lower adsorption
capacity was observed at a lower pH due to electrostatic repulsion
between PSP and target metal ions along with a competition between
H+ ions and target metal ions toward PSP. To arrive at
the charge state of the PSP biosorbent as a function of pH, the point
of zero charge (pHzpc) was used. Above pHzpc, the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged and favors adsorption
of metal cations. In this study, pHzpc obtained for PSP
is 4.2 and the maximum adsorption capacity was established at pH 7.0.
Avoiding hydroxide precipitation, we selected pH 6.5 as an optimum
batch condition for the adsorption process.

Figure 6 (a) Effect of pH on the
adsorption capacity of Zn(II), Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions by the PSP biosorbent, indicating a pH of
6.5 as an optimum pH for batch experiments. (b) Plot depicting the
ζ-potential as a function of pH for NPS and PSP, confirming
a more negative surface in PSP for efficient metal uptake. Batch conditions:
contact time: 3 h; temperature: 298 K; initial metal concentration:
100 mg/L; adsorbent dose: 25 mg; solution volume: 40 mL.

2.3.2 Effect of Initial Metal Concentration and
the Langmuir Isotherm
In Figure S5, we present the effect of initial metal concentration on the adsorption
capacity of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) by the PSP biosorbent.
It is evident that with an increase in metal ion concentration the
adsorption capacity initially increases rapidly and then remains almost
constant till a metal ion concentration of 100 mg/L. Therefore, we
selected 100 mg/L as the optimum metal concentration for carrying
out the isotherm and all other batch experimental studies at 298 K.
An adsorption isotherm expresses the relationship between the adsorption
capacity (qe, mg/g) and equilibrium concentration
of an adsorbate (Ce, mg/L). A typical
adsorption isotherm for Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) adsorption
onto the PSP biosorbent is shown in Figure 7a. The results clearly indicate that the
adsorption capacity increases with metal ion concentration up to the
point of saturation adsorption. The enhanced adsorption capacity at
a high initial metal concentration can be related to two main factors,
namely, a high probability of collisions between the metal ion and
PSP, and a high diffusion rate of the metal ion into the PSP biosorbent.
As a result, the driving force will be increased and the mass transfer
resistance will be reduced.51 The higher
amount of metal ions adsorbed at the low initial concentration was
due to the larger ratio of active sites to total metal ions, and therefore,
all metal ions could bind to the active sites of PSP. The actives
sites were progressively occupied by the metal ions and led to no
great difference in the adsorption rate at a higher metal ion concentration.
Adsorption of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) was dominated by
the Langmuir isotherm model; therefore, we analyzed the experimental
data using this model. In this model, metal ions were assumed to undergo
a monolayer-type coverage on the PSP surface. This model assumes that
once an adsorption site is occupied, no further adsorption can occur
at the same site. The Langmuir model is expressed as follows 1  where Ce (mg/L)
is the equilibrium concentration; qe (mg/g)
is the equilibrium adsorption capacity; qm (mg/g) is the theoretical maximum sorption capacity; and KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir adsorption constant.
The values of qm and KL were obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plots of Ce/qe vs Ce, as shown in Figure 7b, and the calculated parameters are presented in Table 1. The theoretical
maximum sorption capacity (qmax) of PSP
for Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) at an initial concentration
of 100 mg/L is 130.54, 106.25, 91.84, and 51.38 mg/g, respectively.
The high correlation coefficients (R2 >
0.99) indicate a good fit with the Langmuir isotherms, suggesting
a monolayer adsorption of these metal ions on PSP. Furthermore, the
values of KL are in between 0.026 and
0.096, which implies that the adsorption of metal ions onto PSP is
favorable. By comparing the qmax values
of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions with other adsorbents (Table 2), the results showed
that PSP present a reasonably better adsorption capacity.

2.3.3 Effect
of Contact Time and Adsorption Kinetics
To investigate the
sorption mechanism and potential rate controlling
steps, such as mass transport and chemical reaction process, kinetic
models have been used to validate the experimental data. These kinetic
models include the Lagergren pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
models.69 Our system fits well in the Lagergren
pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the overall rate
of adsorption of metal cations onto the PSP biosorbent is dominated
by a chemisorption process. The pseudo-second-order kinetic rate equation
is described as follows 2  where qe (mg/g)
is the equilibrium adsorption capacity; qt (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity at time t; K2 is the rate constant for the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model. The kinetic plots are shown in Figure 8a,b. In Figure 8a, contact time is shown to influence the
adsorption of metal cations, and the results clearly illustrate that
the adsorption is initially quite fast and reaches an equilibrium
within 90 min during which most of the Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and
Hg(II) ions are removed. This is attributed to the combined effect
of strong chemical affinity between PSP and Zn(II)/Pb(II) and comparatively
smaller hydrated radius of Cd(II) ions, which eventually results in
fast diffusion of these ions into the matrix of PSP.70 As is evident from Table 3, the pseudo-second-order rate constant (K2) for adsorption of Pb(II) ions was found to be higher
(8.4 × 10–3) than that of Zn(II) ions (7.2
× 10–3). This could be explained by considering
the relatively smaller hydrated radius of Pb(II) ions as given in Table 3. This smaller hydrated
radius facilitates its fast diffusion into the PSP matrix. However,
PSP exhibits higher adsorption capacity for a Zn(II) ion in spite
of its higher hydrated radius (4.30 Å) and the results could
be attributed to entropy reasons as well in terms of the HSAB principle.71 Since Zn(II) ions are extensively hydrated,
more structure breaking will result, releasing more hydrated water
upon zinc ion complexation to the PSP matrix. This phenomenon is expected
to increase the overall entropy and, therefore, the overall thermodynamic
feasibility of adsorption. Comparing qe with qe,exp for Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II),
and Hg(II) ions, the qe values obtained
by the pseudo-second-order equation are 112.86, 91.74, 77.27, and
48.56 mg/g, respectively, and the values are close to the values obtained
by the experiment. In addition to this, the values of R2 for Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions shown in Table 3 clearly indicate
the best fit of data with the pseudo-second-order model.

2.3.4 Thermodynamic Studies
The overall
feasibility of an adsorption process can be evaluated in terms of
entropy and free energy change of the adsorption process. We carried
out the adsorption of Zn(II), Pb(II), and Cd(II) ions on PSP at different
temperatures (293–313 K) to evaluate various thermodynamic
parameters (ΔH0, ΔS0, and ΔG0) of the adsorption process. The results of qe as a function of T are shown in Figure 9a, and the results
indicate that with an increase in temperature the adsorption capacity
also increases, which is indicative of the endergonicity of the overall
process. The thermodynamic parameters can be calculated using the
following equations 3   4   5  where T (K) is the temperature
of the solution, R is the gas constant (8.314 JK–1mol–1), and K0 is the equilibrium constant. Linear fitting of ln K0 vs 1/T for the adsorption
of Zn(II), Pb(II), and Cd(II) ions on PSP is shown in Figure 9b.The values of ΔH0/R and ΔS0/R were obtained from the slope and
intercept of the ln K0 vs 1/T plot, respectively, and the results are shown in Table 4. The positive value
of ΔH0 confirmed the endothermic
nature of the overall adsorption process and the negative value of
ΔG0 indicated that the adsorption
process is spontaneously driven.

2.4 Density Functional Theory
Analysis
To validate the experimental selectivity and to
further investigate
the chemical interactions between Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), and Hg(II)
ions and the PSP biosorbent, DFT calculations were carried out using
the Gaussian 03 program.72 To mimic the
chemical selectivity, we take a piece of cross-linked starch as our
model for computational details. Abundant hydroxyl groups are available
for metal ion binding, which includes surface hydroxyls, glycosidic
hydroxyls, and phosphate hydroxyls. On the basis of a Mulliken charge
analysis (Figure S6), the phosphate oxygen
atoms are shown to carry more negative partial charges than either
terminal oxygen or glycosidic oxygen, and hence, the phosphate oxygen
is expected to be a more favorable site for the adsorption of metal
cations. Based on these results, the optimized geometries of the cluster
models PSP–M2+ are shown in Figure 10, wherein the cation, M2+ (M
= Zn, Pb, Cd, and Hg), is bonded to phosphate oxygen atoms in an optimized
structure. The values of binding energy (Ebd) are calculated as Ebd and are shown
in Figure 11a. A positive Ebd value indicates that the adsorption is favorable
and the interaction is stable.73 The calculated
values of binding energy for Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), and Hg(II) are
298.10, 219.35, 206.26, and 112.46 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore,
DFT calculations also verify that PSP shows the strongest adsorption
selectivity toward Zn(II) among all tested heavy metal ions. These
results are also within the paradigm of Pearson’s HSAB principle,
wherein borderline cations Zn(II) and Pb(II) are expected to interact
more strongly with the hard anion (O–) and, consequently,
soft cations (Cd(II) and Hg(II)) interact the least.69 In general, the interaction between metal cations and the
oxygen atom of PSP becomes stronger as the average M(II)–O
bond distance decreases. To arrive at such a conclusion, single point
energy (SPE) scans were carried out for all four metal cations, and
the plots are shown in Figure S7 and the
corresponding M(II)–O bond distances are plotted in Figure 11b, with the inset
in Figure 11b pictorially
describing Zn(II) ion binding. SPE scan results clearly indicate that
the metal–oxygen distance increases in the order Zn < Pb
< Cd < Hg; therefore, Zn(II) ions interact the most at a relatively
short bond distance of 1.952 Å, while Hg(II) ions interact the
least at 2.35 Å. Such measurements also suggest more strong and
covalent interactions between Zn(II) ions and the PSP biosorbent.

2.5 Selectivity of Adsorbent
In real
water samples, heavy metal ions coexist in wastewater, especially
Zn, Pb, and Cd ions. Therefore, it is interesting and also necessary
to test the selective adsorption performance of PSP. For the competitive
adsorption of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions, 25 mg of PSP
was added to 40 ml of solution containing 100 mg/L of each ion. For
the purpose of comparison, a control experiment was carried out under
the same batch conditions. The results are shown in Figure 12 and indicate excellent adsorption
selectivity toward Zn ions. The same selectivity was observed from
the DFT results, and the results are once again within the paradigm
of the HSAB principle. We observe a slight decrease in adsorption
capacity of Zn ions due to a competition between coexisting ions and
Zn(II) ions for adsorption sites on PSP. This study suggests that
Zn ions can be quantitatively separated from some binary (Zn(II)–Pb(II),
Zn(II)–Cd(II) and Zn(II)–Hg(II)) and ternary mixtures
(Zn(II)–Pb(II)–Hg(II) and Zn(II)–Cd(II)–Hg(II))
using a column loaded with PSP.

adsorption capacity

for Zn(II) ions. Batch conditions: initial metal concentration: 100
mg/L; pH: 6.5; contact time: 90 min; adsorbent dose: 25 mg; solution
volume: 40 mL.

2.6 Mechanism
of Metal Ion Uptake
The
heavy metal ions are known to bind starch and cross-linked starch
in three ways: (a) zinc starch inclusion complex,74 (b) ion exchange, and (c) adsorption. The zinc starch inclusion
complex is a well-known and thoroughly investigated area, in which
Zn(II) ions interact with two 6-CH2OH groups from one starch
chain. This possibility of Zn(II) complexation can be ruled out as
the 6-CH2OH groups are not free and they are busy in phosphodiester
bond formation. Therefore, the uptake of metal ions on PSP could be
explained in terms of ion exchange and adsorption processes. Although
ion exchange and adsorption share some similar characteristics, ion
exchange is a bulk phenomenon involving the entire volume of the adsorbent,
while adsorption is typically a surface phenomenon. At low pH ≤
4.0, the dominant mode of metal ion binding is exchange with H+ ions of PSP, especially at the phosphate center, as inferred
from Mulliken charge analysis. At higher pH > 5.0, the surface
of
PSP attains enough negative charge, as can be easily seen from ζ-potential
measurements. Due to the negatively charged surface of PSP, cationic
target metal ions get attracted and finally get adsorbed on the surface
of PSP. We summarize that the uptake of metal ions occurs either by
ion exchange or adsorption or by both, depending on the charged state
of the adsorbent, as shown schematically in Scheme 2.

Metal Ion Uptake: Adsorption
and Ion Exchange by PSP at Different pH Values
2.7 Reusability of Adsorbent
Practically,
an ideal adsorbent should not only possess good adsorption capacity,
but also show excellent regeneration ability without any appreciable
loss in adsorption capacity over multiple cycles. For the purpose
of regenerating the PSP biosorbent, metal-complexed PSP was placed
in 0.1 M HCl solution under continuous ultrasonication for desorption/cation
exchange. The suspension was kept undisturbed for 3 h to ensure complete
exchange/desorption of heavy metal cations. The partially settled
suspension was centrifuged and washed with deionized (DI) water to
remove excess acid, followed by drying at 40 °C. Now the regenerated
PSP biosorbent is ready for reuse. As inferred from Figure 13, PSP revealed excellent regeneration/reusability
over five adsorption cycles with a slight decrease (7.07%) in the
adsorption capacity for Zn(II) ions. This slight decrease may be due
to the loss of a few binding sites on the surface of the PSP biosorbent.
Therefore, the good adsorption capacity and excellent reusable tendency
of PSP categorize it as an ideal material for heavy metal decontamination.

consecutive adsorption cycles, revealing its excellent regeneration/reusability.

3 Conclusions
A bio-based
potato starch phosphate polymer adsorbent has been
successfully prepared by a cross-linking reaction between phosphoryl
chloride and hydroxyl groups of native potato starch. Under microwave
and ultrasonic irradiation, the biosorbent develops into a dumbbell-
and flower-shaped morphology. Cross-linking decreases the swelling
tendency of starch and therefore increases the resistance to retrograde.
PSP adsorbs Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions from aqueous medium
with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 130.54, 106.25, 91.84,
and 51.38 mg/g, respectively. EDX elemental mapping studies of Zn-complexed
PSP demonstrate uniform distribution of Zn ions over the surface of
the PSP material. The experimental data fitted well with the Langmuir
model. The adsorption process is quite fast, which could reach adsorption
equilibrium within 90 min, and follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model. The thermodynamic studies demonstrated that adsorption processes
were endothermic and spontaneous. Adsorption performance of PSP showed
good pH dependency, and the overall adsorption selectivity was further
supported by DFT studies in terms of (a) interaction energies between
PSP and Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) ions; (b) Mulliken charge
analysis; and (c) M(II)–O bond length measurements. Moreover,
the PSP biosorbent showed excellent reusability without any appreciable
loss in adsorption performance over five adsorption cycles.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Potato
starch was supplied
by HPLC, Mumbai, India (CAS NO: 9005-25-8) with an amylose content
of 20%. Phosphoryl chloride (POCl3), AR grade, was purchased
from Merck, Germany. All other chemicals used were purchased from
Fischer scientific, U.K., and were used as purchased.

4.2 Preparation of PSP-Based Biosorbent
PSP was prepared
by the method adopted by Zheng et al. with slight
modifications.75 In a typical procedure,
10 g of NPS granules were ultrasonically dispersed in 30 mL of DI
water containing 20% Na2SO4 to obtain a uniform
dispersion. The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 11.0 with dilute
NaOH solution. The dispersion was then subjected to microwave irradiation
at 80 °C by placing the dispersion in a Monowave 100 (Anton Parr,
operating at 500 W power) with constant stirring at 600 rpm for 30
min to accelerate the structural damage with an aim to increase the
porosity of starch granules to allow more POCl3 to permeate
the internal structure of starch. After microwave irradiation, 0.1%
POCl3 (based on the dry weight of starch) was added to
the starch dispersion under ultrasonication operating at 250 W power.
Ultrasonication was continued for another 30 min to ensure complete
cross-linking at 40 °C. The product was removed and the pH was
then adjusted to pH 5.5 with dil. HCl. The product was then filtered
and washed repeatedly with DI and then dried at 40 °C. The dried
PSP was then sieved to obtain an average mesh size of 200 μm.

4.3 Phosphorus Analysis
The phosphorus
content in PSP was analyzed spectrometrically according to the Polish
and Norm procedure.76 Briefly, PSP was
mineralized in conc. HNO3 and H2SO4. Then aqueous ammonium molybdate solution was added leading to the
formation of phosphomolybdate containing Mo(VII) ions. The complex
obtained was then reduced to a blue-colored solution containing Mo(V)
ions with ascorbic acid. The blue-colored solution was analyzed for
the content of phosphorus by measuring the absorbance at 823 nm. The
phosphorus content was found from the calibration curve. The results
were further confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (PerkinElmer optima 5300 DV). For PSP, we obtained a
percent phosphorus content of 3.16, which was much higher than that
reported earlier by Heo et al.77 This higher
phosphorus content may be attributed to the presence of more phosphodiester
cross-links, which arise mainly due to the collaborative effect of
microwave and ultrasonic treatments.

4.4 Characterization
of PSP
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the sample were recorded over a range of
400–4000 cm–1 using a PerkinElmer Spectrum-100
FTIR. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a simultaneous
thermal analyzer (STA, LINSEIS, USA 6807/8835/16) with a heating rate
of 15 °C min–1 under an air atmosphere. The
morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi,
S3000H, Japan). To corroborate the presence of Zn(II) ions over the
surface of PSP, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and elemental mapping
studies were carried out using a Zeiss Ultraplus-4095 instrument.
ζ-Potentials of NPS and PSP were determined over a varied pH
range (2–9) using a zetasizer nano ZS (Malvern Instruments
Ltd., U.K.). Briefly, samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ultrapure
water and analyzed at 25 °C. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 H surface area
analyzer at 77 K. The specific surface areas of NPS and PSP were measured
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Before the
test, the powder samples were degassed at 300 °C under vacuum
for 3 h. For a better understanding of pore size distribution in the
potato starch phosphate adsorbent material, Barret–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) analysis was carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 H.
The crystalline structure of the prepared samples was characterized
using a X-ray diffractometer (Ultima-IV, Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. The samples were scanned in the
2θ range of 5–45° with a scan rate of 5 min–1.

4.5 Rheological Characterization
of NPS and PSP
Gels
The rheological tests for NPS and PSP gels were carried
out with an Anton Paar rheometer (MCR102 at 25 ± 0.01°)
with a cone and plate system (50 mm diameter and 1.006° cone
angle).

4.6 Adsorption Experiments
Adsorption
studies were carried out by a usual batch method. Briefly, 25 mg of
PSP was taken in a 100 mL flask to which 40 mL of different metal
ion solutions were added. After continuous shaking for 3 h at 120
rpm, the suspension was centrifuged and filtered. The supernatant
was analyzed for equilibrium adsorption concentration of Zn(II), Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Hg(II) by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA-6800 Shimadzu,
Japan). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 to 9 using universal
buffer. The amount of Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) adsorbed
on PSP, i.e., qe (mg g–1) was calculated using the equation 6  where Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of metal ions (mg L–1), V is the volume of the solution
(L), and M is the weight of the adsorbent (g).

4.7 Computational
Details
Theoretical
calculations were performed on a model material PSP using density
functional theory (DFT) as incorporated in the Gaussian 03 set of
codes. Geometry optimizations were carried out with Becke’s
three-parameter hybrid model using the Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation functional (B3LYP) and LanL2DZ basis set.78,79
