A facile two-step method was developed
to prepare core/shell ZnO/rGO
particles from ZIF-8/rGO composites. ZIF-8 particles were first grown
at the surface of rGO sheets. Next, ZIF-8 particles were transformed
into ZnO particles by thermal decomposition under air at 500 °C.
All materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
thermogravimetric analysis, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
analyses. Results obtained show that ZIF-8 particles strongly associate
with rGO sheets and that the calcination of this material produces
porous core/shell ZnO/rGO particles with an average diameter of ca.
40 nm. The wt % of rGO associated with ZIF-8 particles was varied
from 5 to 20%. The ZnO/rGO (10%) particles exhibit the highest photocatalytic
activity for the degradation of the Orange II dye under simulated
solar light irradiation of weak intensity (5 mW/cm2). This
high photocatalytic activity was demonstrated to originate from superoxide
O2•– radicals due to the efficient
trapping of photogenerated electrons in ZnO by rGO.

1 Introduction
ZIF-8 (Zn(mim)2, mim– = 2-methylimidazolate)
is a zeolite-type metal organic framework possessing high chemical
and thermal stabilities (up to 550 °C under nitrogen).1−4 ZIF-8 particles exhibit the sodalite topology in which ZnN4 tetrahedra are connected through mim– linkers
to form cages 1.16 nm in diameter and with an aperture size estimated
to be 0.34 nm.5,6 Owing to their high specific surface
area (up to 1700 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g), ZIF-8 particles have found many applications, including selective
adsorption,7 separation,8 sensing,9 and catalysis.10 ZIF-8 can also be used as a precursor for the
preparation of porous materials. Calcination of ZIF-8 at a moderate
temperature (400–500 °C) under air allows the preparation
of ZnO,11−15 whereas treatment at a higher temperature (900–1000 °C)
yields nanoporous carbons.16−19 A few studies have demonstrated that porous ZnO and
carbons produced from ZIF-8 have high potential as a catalyst, as
a photocatalyst, or for supercapacitor electrodes.11,13,16,18

Reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) can be prepared by partial removal
of epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxylic acid functions from the edges and
the basal planes of graphene oxide (GO). rGO has attracted high interest
due to its electrical conductivity and high specific surface area
compared to those of GO and has thus found promising applications
in catalysis or drug delivery, as well as in devices like sensors
and supercapacitors.20−23

Nanocomposites formed by metal oxides like ZnO and rGO have
attracted
great attention for photocatalytic applications due to the synergetic
properties coming from each component.24−32 ZnO/rGO photocatalysts have been demonstrated to be of high efficiency
for the degradation of organic dyes like Methylene Blue under UV or
artificial solar irradiation and for hydrogen production from water.24−32

ZnO is one of the leading photocatalysts for water treatment
due
to its high photosensitivity, its ability to generate reactive oxygen
species, its low cost, and its weak toxicity.33−37 Upon light excitation, electron/hole pairs in ZnO
may react with oxygen and water to generate superoxide (O2•–) and hydroxyl (•OH)
radicals that allow the oxidation of various organic compounds in
air or in water. If ZnO is well associated with rGO, rGO will not
only act as a sink of the photogenerated electrons but will also allow
their migration and thus hinder the charge recombination and improve
the photocatalytic efficiency.

In this article, we report the
first synthesis of ZIF-8/rGO nanocomposites
and their successful transformation into core/shell ZnO/rGO particles
by annealing at 500 °C. ZnO particles have an average diameter
of 40 nm and are capped by a continuous rGO shell with a thickness
of ca. 5 nm. The use of ZnO/rGO materials as photocatalysts for the
degradation of the Orange II dye under simulated solar light was also
explored.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Structure of ZnO/rGO Particles
A simple two-step method
was developed to prepare core/shell ZnO/rGO
particles using ZIF-8/rGO composites as precursors (Scheme 1). Briefly, ZIF-8 particles
were produced by reacting Zn(NO3)2 with Hmim
in water in the presence of rGO sheets to form ZIF-8/rGO composites.38,39 Next, ZnO/rGO particles were prepared by thermal decomposition of
ZIF-8/rGO composites at 500 °C and under air.

of the Synthetic Route Used for the Preparation
of ZIF-8/rGO Composites and Their Conversion into ZnO/rGO Particles
by Calcination
The evolutions of
morphology, crystalline structure, optical properties,
and texture during the thermal decomposition of ZIF-8/rGO composites
into ZnO/rGO particles were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analyses. Powder XRD patterns of ZIF-8/rGO composites with rGO
contents of 5, 10, and 20 wt % are similar to those of pure ZIF-8,4 indicating that the sodalite structure of ZIF-8
crystals was not altered by association with rGO (Figure 1a). The weak and broad diffraction
peak of rGO at 2θ = 25° could not be observed in all of
the samples prepared. An SEM image of rGO shows crumpled sheets, which
is the typical morphology of rGO (Figure S1a). SEM images demonstrate that ZIF-8 crystals were strongly associated
with rGO sheets, suggesting that ZIF-8 crystals nucleate and grow
around rGO due to the coordination of Zn2+ cations with
hydroxyl and carboxylate functions present at the surface of rGO sheets
(Figure S1b–d). This is in accordance
with a previous report related to the preparation of ZIF-8/GO composites.40 The strong association of ZIF-8 crystals with
rGO was further confirmed by TEM (Figure 2). For rGO contents of 5 and 10 wt %, most
of the ZIF-8 particles exhibit the typical rhombic dodecahedron morphology
(Figure 2a,b).4 The largest ZIF-8 particles have an average diameter
of ca. 225 nm, and no significant changes in particles sizes and distributions
and in morphology were detected between these two samples (the average
diameters are 147 ± 50 and 158 ± 70 nm for ZIF-8 particles
associated with 5 and 10% rGO, respectively). For the composite prepared
with 20 wt % rGO, more particles with irregular or spherical morphology
could be observed along with smaller ones (Figure 2c). The estimated average diameter (110 ±
60 nm) indicates that a high amount of rGO in the reaction medium
perturbs the growth of ZIF-8 crystals.

distributions.

After a thermal treatment
at 500 °C for 3 h, ZIF-8/rGO composites
transform into core/shell ZnO/rGO particles. All the diffraction peaks
of these materials can be indexed to the standard hexagonal wurtzite
structure of ZnO (space group P63mc, JCPDS No 36-1451) and were sharp, indicating the high
crystallinity of ZnO produced by the thermal decomposition of ZIF-8
(Figure 1b). As previously
observed for ZIF-8/rGO composites, rGO was not detected by XRD analyses.

The association of rGO with ZnO was demonstrated using energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The C element was present besides Zn and
O, and the elemental mapping indicates that rGO was homogeneously
distributed at the surface of ZnO particles (Figure 1c–f). The C element was not detected
by the elemental mapping at the surface of ZnO particles produced
from ZIF-8 (Figure S2), indicating that
pure ZnO is produced after the calcination at 500 °C and that
the mim– linker decomposition does not generate
any carbon-based materials. This result is in accordance with previous
reports.11,12 The wurtzite structure of ZnO was further
confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 1g). The signals located at 329, 373, and
432 cm–1 can be assigned to the E2, A1TO, and E2 (high) vibration modes of ZnO, respectively.
The D and G bands of starting rGO were observed at 1339 and 1583 cm–1, respectively. The ID/IG ratio is 1.07, indicating that rGO
is of high graphitic degree. Only weak signals were detected for the
D and G bands after calcination, although Raman spectroscopy is highly
versatile for the characterization of graphitic materials,41 suggesting that the structure of rGO was markedly
altered during the conversion of ZIF-8 into ZnO particles.

The
changes in rGO morphology during the calcination step were
confirmed by TEM and HR-TEM (Figure 3). ZnO particles produced from ZIF-8 have an average
diameter of 40 ± 10 nm, are of spherical/ellipsoidal morphology,
and are covered by a smooth and continuous rGO shell with a thickness
of ca. 5 nm (see Figure 3a,b for the ZnO/rGO (10%) sample). HR-TEM and the corresponding C-mapping
conducted with Energy Filtered-TEM (EF-TEM) demonstrate that an rGO
layer uniformly surrounds ZnO crystals, yielding core/shell ZnO/rGO
particles (Figure 3c,d). This shell could not be observed at the periphery of ZnO particles
produced after calcination of ZIF-8 crystals (Figure S3), which is in good agreement with the EDX elemental
mapping shown in Figure S2.

c) HR-TEM images of the ZnO/rGO (10%) particles
and (d) the C-mapping corresponding to image (c).

The thermal stability of the ZIF-8/rGO (10%) composite was
compared
to that of pure ZIF-8 crystals by thermogravimetric analyses. Under
an O2 atmosphere, ZIF-8 particles start to decompose at
ca. 400 °C into ZnO, and the weight loss observed is 65%.4 Under N2, a weak weight loss of ca.
7%, corresponding to the desorption of surface-bound water and/or
the removal of guest molecules like Hmim, was observed between 20
and 200 °C (Figure 4a). The ZIF-8 framework exhibits higher stability under N2 than under O2, and its gradual decomposition occurs between
450 and 800 °C, leaving ca. 25 wt % of nanoporous carbon as the
residue.17 The thermal stability of the
ZIF-8/rGO (10%) composite under N2 is increased compared
to that of pure ZIF-8 particles. A long quasiplateau is observed in
the temperature range of 20–550 °C. A marked weight loss
(ca. 62%) related to the decomposition of the mim– linker occurs from 550 to 1000 °C. By comparing the weight
loss of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8/rGO, the actual content of rGO in the composite
can be estimated to be 13%, a value only slightly higher than the
theoretical content in rGO (10%). This result further demonstrates
than the ZIF-8 crystal nucleation and growth are only weakly perturbed
by the presence of 10 wt % rGO.

Figure 4 (a) Thermogravimetric profiles of ZIF-8
and ZIF-8/rGO (10%) composites
in a nitrogen atmosphere and (b) UV–visible diffuse reflectance
spectra of ZnO and ZnO/rGO particles.

The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of ZnO/rGO
particles
are shown in Figure 4b. The absorption edge of ZnO is located at ca. 370 nm, which corresponds
to a bandgap of 3.25 eV using the Tauc model αhν ∼ (hν – Eg)1/2, where α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency
of vibration, and Eg is the bandgap. The
bandgap of ZnO particles remains unchanged after association with
rGO. However, due to the relatively high absorption coefficient of
rGO in the visible region, the absorbance of core/shell ZnO/rGO particles
increases in this wavelength region with the increase of rGO content.
ZnO/rGO particles will harvest more light than ZnO and should exhibit
an enhanced photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light irradiation.

The specific surface area, pore size, and pore size distributions
were determined by N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
(Figure 5). ZIF-8/rGO
composites exhibit typical type-IV adsorption isotherms according
to the IUPAC classification (Figure 5a).42 A first steep increase
of N2 adsorption at a low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.1) and a slight increase at
a high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.9) are indicative of the microporosity of the composites.
A second step can be observed at P/P0 = 0.05, which probably originates from mesoporous rGO.
The specific surface areas, determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, the pore size, and the pore volume of ZIF-8/rGO (5 and
10%) composites are listed in Table 1 and are in good agreement with those measured for
pure ZIF-8 crystals.1,4 The BET results show that the
surface area decreases when a high amount of rGO (20 wt %) is combined
with ZIF-8 crystals, suggesting a strong association of ZIF-8 with
rGO and that the cavities inside ZIF-8 are partially blocked by rGO
sheets. After thermolysis, the microporous network collapsed but mesopores
and micropores were still present in the ZnO/rGO (5 and 10%) particles
as demonstrated by N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
(Figure 5b). The fast
increase of the material isotherms at relative P/P0 near 1 is close to type III isotherms42 and suggests also the presence of macropores.

2.2 Photocatalytic
Activity
ZnO and ZnO/rGO
particles produced from ZIF-8 and ZIF-8/rGO composites, respectively,
were evaluated for the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous solutions
of the Orange II dye (10 mg/L) at pH = 7 and under simulated solar
light irradiation (intensity = 5 mW/cm2). The Orange II
diazo dye was selected as a model pollutant because it has no photosensitizing
activity, contrary to Methylene Blue or Rhodamine that promote the
photodegradation process. No changes were observed in the Orange II
UV–visible absorption spectra in control experiments conducted
in the dark in the presence of the photocatalyst. Similar results
were obtained under light irradiation in the absence of the photocatalyst,
indicating that the photoinduced self-degradation of the dye does
not occur. After stirring in the dark for 60 min, the adsorption capacity
of ZnO/rGO (10%) particles (24%) is slightly higher than that of ZnO
or ZnO/rGO (5 or 20%) particles (17%) (Figure 6a). As can be seen, the degree of Orange
II photodegradation varied with the content of rGO associated with
ZnO. An increase of rGO content from 5 to 10 wt % increased the photocatalytic
activity, probably because electrons are more efficiently captured
and thus electron/hole pair recombinations are reduced. Nearly 99%
of the dye was bleached in 240 min using the ZnO/rGO (10%) catalyst.
The decrease in photocatalytic activity observed for ZnO/rGO (20%)
particles may be ascribed to the increased light absorption and scattering
of this material due to its darker color compared to that of ZnO/rGO
(5 and 10%) particles. This result is consistent with previous studies.31

Figure 6 (a) Influence of the rGO loading on the photocatalytic
activity
of ZnO/rGO nanoparticles for the degradation of Orange II in aqueous
solution at pH = 7. (b) Influence of pH on the photodegradation of
Orange II by the ZnO/rGO (10%) composite (C is the
Orange II concentration at time t, and C0 is the concentration of the dye at t = 0; volume of solution, 40 mL; Orange II concentration, 10 mg/L).

The photodegradation kinetics
of Orange II could be fitted to a
pseudo-first-order reaction ln(C/C0) = −kt, where C0 is the initial concentration of the dye, C is the concentration at time t, and k is the degradation rate constant (min–1). Using
the fitting results described in Figure S4, the k values determined from the slopes of the
straight lines are 0.007, 0.008, 0.013, and 0.007 min–1 for ZnO and for the ZnO/rGO particles with rGO loadings of 5, 10,
and 20%, respectively. These values confirm that the synergetic effect
between ZnO and rGO is optimal when using 10 wt % of rGO relative
to ZnO.

The pH of the aqueous solution does not play a key role
in the
photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO/rGO particles (Figure 6b). The adsorption of the dye on the photocatalyst
surface was not affected by pH changes from 3 to 9. The degradation
rate is the highest at pH = 7 (k = 0.013 min–1). The k values determined at pH
= 3, 5, and 9 are lower (0.007, 0.007, and 0.006 min–1, respectively), but no detrimental effect on the photodegradation
was observed (Figure S5). At pH = 11, no
adsorption of Orange II at the surface of the catalyst was observed,
but the further oxidation of the dye proceeded efficiently (k = 0.011 min–1). The point of zero charge
of the ZnO/rGO catalyst was determined to be 7.7, a value lower than
that of pure ZnO (pzc = 9.0 ± 0.3)43 due to the presence of rGO at the periphery of ZnO particles (the
pzc of pure rGO is 3.5 ± 0.4). For Orange II, the pKa of the naphthol function is 11.4 and the sulfonic acid
is present in its sulfonate form in the whole pH range studied (pKa = 1). It is therefore likely that Orange II
is only repelled by the ZnO/rGO catalyst at high pH values but without
consequences on the photodegradation. At lower pH values, Orange II
probably binds to the ZnO/rGO particle surface through hydrogen bonds (naphthol with Zn–OH
at pH values lower than 7.7 or naphthol with Zn–O– at pH values higher than 7.7). ZnO is well-known to exhibit a higher
photocatalytic activity at basic pH (the optimal activity is generally
located at pHs 9–10),43 which was
ascribed to the easier production of hydroxyl radicals •OH from –OH than from H2O. For the ZnO/rGO
photocatalyst, the highest activity was observed at neutral pH, which
may be linked to the presence of rGO at the surface of ZnO.

We also evaluated the stability of the photocatalyst after the
reaction conducted at pHs 3, 7, and 11. The photocatalysts were recovered
by centrifugation after the Orange II photodegradations and their
structure analyzed by XRD. No changes in the XRD patterns were observed
compared to those of the native ZnO/rGO particles (Figure S6), indicating that ZnO did not dissolve or decompose
even in strong alkaline or acidic aqueous solution. This high stability
of ZnO/rGO particles may be attributed to the rGO shell surrounding
and protecting the ZnO core from the environment.

2.3 Mechanism of the Photodegradation
The photocatalytic
activity of a material depends among others on
its specific surface area, and thus its adsorption capability, as
well as on the effectiveness of photogenerated electrons and holes
separation. We compared the dark adsorption of Orange II at the surface
of ZnO and ZnO/rGO (10%) particles. A slight increase of the dye adsorption
from 19 to 24% was observed when rGO was associated with ZnO (Figure S7). This result demonstrates that the
adsorption capacity does not play a key role on the improved photocatalytic
activity of ZnO/rGO particles and more likely originates from the
effective photogenerated electron transfer from ZnO to rGO deposited
at its surface.

Orange II may be photodegraded by •OH and O2•– radicals and holes
(h+) generated after activation of the ZnO/rGO catalyst
by light. Trapping experiments were conducted using t-BuOH, ammonium oxalate, p-benzoquinone, and K2S2O8 as •OH, h+, O2•–, and e– scavengers, respectively. Figure 7a and the related pseudo-first-order kinetic plots
(Figure S8) demonstrate that p-benzoquinone had the most deleterious effect (k = 0.002 min–1), indicating that O2•– radicals are the main oxidative species responsible
for the degradation of the dye, probably because rGO promotes the
e– delocalization and their reaction with O2. This was further proved by conducting the photodegradation
in an N2-saturated solution (Figure 7b). It can be seen that the photodegradation
rate was decreased in the N2-saturated solution (k = 0.0066 min–1) compared to that in
the air-equilibrated solution (k = 0.013 min–1) (Figure S9). •OH radicals and direct oxidation of the dye by h+ are
also involved in the mechanism but to a lesser extent than O2•– (k = 0.005 and 0.004
min–1 for reactions conducted in the presence of t-BuOH and ammonium oxalate, respectively) (Figure 7a). Finally, the e– scavenger, K2S2O8, does not quite
have an effect (k = 0.012 vs 0.013 min–1 in the absence of a scavenger), suggesting that e– photogenerated and then trapped by rGO quickly react with O2 to yield O2•– radicals.

Figure 7 (a) Influence
of t-BuOH, p-benzoquinone,
K2S2O8, and ammonium oxalate used
as •OH, O2•–, e–, and h+ scavengers, respectively,
on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/rGO particles. Except p-benzoquinone used at 0.1 mM, all scavengers were used
at a 10 mM concentration. (b) Photocatalytic degradation of Orange
II in air-equilibrated (black line) and N2-purged (red
line) aqueous solutions.

Using the bandgap of ZnO determined from UV–visible
absorption
spectra (Eg = 3.25 eV), the band edge
positions of the valence (VB) and of the conduction band (CB) of ZnO
were determined using the Mulliken electronegativity theory.44 1   2  where χ is the absolute electronegativity
of ZnO (5.89 eV) and Ec is the energy
of free electrons on a hydrogen scale (4.5 eV). Using eqs 1 and 2, the EVB and ECB of ZnO
were estimated to be 2.915 and −0.335 eV, respectively (Figure 8a). The Fermi level
of rGO is −0.08 eV versus NHE.45 Thus, e– can easily be transferred from the ZnO
CB to rGO before reacting with O2 to form O2•– radicals (the potential of rGO being
more negative than that of the O2/O2•– couple, −0.046 eV). Holes in the VB of ZnO have a potential
greater than 2.32 eV and are able to generate •OH
radicals. On the basis of trapping experiments and on the well-coupled
energy levels of ZnO, rGO, and the O2/O2•– and H2O/•OH couples,
it can be concluded that the photocatalytic activity is mainly governed
by the separation efficiency of e– and h+. Once ZnO is excited by solar light, e– are efficiently
transferred to rGO due to the core/shell structure of ZnO/rGO particles
that will promote the transport of e– and h+ across ZnO particles due to the dipolar fields originating
from charged surface domains.46 These e– quickly react with O2 and generate O2•– radicals. In the meanwhile, the
h+ in the VB of ZnO oxidize H2O to yield •OH radicals (H+ is the by-product) or the
dye (Figure 8b).

light photocatalytic activity of core/shell ZnO/rGO particles.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a simple method allowing the preparation of new
core/shell ZnO/rGO particles using ZIF-8 as the precursor of ZnO was
developed. We first demonstrated that ZIF-8 particles can successfully
be grown in an aqueous solution at the surface of rGO sheets. Next,
rGO sheets were found to deposit at the periphery of ZnO particles
during the calcination of ZIF-8, yielding core/shell ZnO/rGO particles
with an average diameter of 40 nm. At low rGO loading (5 or 10 wt
%), the high specific surface of ZIF-8 is maintained (SBET = 1700 m2/g) and is partly transferred
to ZnO during the calcination. ZnO/rGO (10%) particles exhibit the
highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the Orange
II dye under simulated solar light irradiation. The mechanism of the
photodegradation was studied, and the key role played by superoxide
O2•– radicals was demonstrated,
indicating the ability of the rGO shell to trap the photogenerated
electrons in ZnO. Our study should open the way for engineering new
metal oxide/rGO core/shell particles of high interest for catalytic
or sensing applications by simply varying the MOF used as the precursor.

using Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm, Millipore) as the solvent.

4.2 Preparation of Exfoliated Graphene Oxide (GO)
GO was prepared by oxidation of graphite by a modified Hummer’s
method, followed by exfoliation.47 In brief,
2 g of graphite and 1 g of NaNO3 were mixed in a flask
kept at 0 °C. Then, 50 mL of concentrated H2SO4 was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min.
KMnO4 (0.3 g) was added to the solution, and the mixture
was stirred for 30 min. Next, 7 g of KMnO4 was added portion-wise,
and the mixture was further stirred for 1 h at a temperature below
20 °C. Then, the temperature was increased to 35 °C. After
2 h, 90 mL of H2O was slowly added (the temperature increased
to ca. 70 °C), and the mixture was stirred for 15 min, followed
by the addition of a mixture of 7 mL of H2O2 and 55 mL of water to reduce the residual KMnO4 to soluble
manganese ions. Next, the suspension was filtered using a polycarbonate
membrane, washed 4 times with 5% aqueous HCl and 5 times with water.
GO was obtained as a brownish powder after drying at 60 °C for
24 h. This powder was dispersed in water (1 mg/mL), and the exfoliation
was conducted by ultrasonication for 1 h by probe sonication (amplitude
25%). Finally, GO was collected by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 15
min) and dried at 60 °C for 24 h before use.

4.3 Reduction of GO
The reduction of
GO into rGO was conducted according to the procedure described by
Zhang et al.48 with slight modifications.
Briefly, 15 mg of GO was dispersed by sonication in 50 mL of water. l-Ascorbic acid (200 mg) was added to the GO dispersion, and
the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. rGO was collected
by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 15 min), washed with water, and dried
overnight at 60 °C.

4.4 Synthesis of ZIF-8/rGO
Nanocomposites
The ZIF-8 precursor was prepared accordingly
to procedures reported
in the literature with slight modifications.38,39 A typical synthesis for the ZIF-8/rGO (10%) composite is described.
Briefly, 12.3 g of Hmim were dissolved in 90 mL of water. Next, 50
mg of rGO was added to the Hmim solution, and the mixture was sonicated
for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. Under stirring, to the
Hmim and rGO solution was added 0.744 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 10 mL of water, and the solution
was further stirred for 15 h at room temperature. The ZIF-8/rGO composite
was recovered from the solution by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 15
min) and washed one time with water and two times with ethanol. The
product was dried in an oven for 2 h at 70 °C. ZIF-8/rGO (5%)
and ZIF-8/rGO (20%) composites were prepared using the same synthetic
protocol except that 25 and 100 mg of rGO were used, respectively.

4.5 Preparation of ZnO/rGO Particles
The ZIF-8/rGO
composite was placed in a ceramic boat and then transferred
to a furnace. The calcination was performed at 500 °C (heating
rate of 10 °C/min) for 3 h under air. The ZnO/rGO particles were
isolated as gray powders after cooling to room temperature and used
without treatment for photocatalytic studies.

4.6 Photocatalytic
Performance Test
The
photocatalytic activity of ZnO/rGO particles for the degradation of
Orange II (10 mg/L in water) was evaluated by recording the UV–visible
absorption of the solution after illumination. The simulated solar
light was generated by Sylvania LuxLine FHO T5 neon tubes. The light
intensity at the surface of the Orange II solution was 5 mW/cm2. In a typical experiment, ZnO/rGO particles (40 mg) were
dispersed in 40 mL of the Orange II aqueous solution. Before irradiation,
the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark under ambient
conditions for 1 h to attain the adsorption–desorption equilibrium.
Samples were taken at regular time intervals and immediately centrifuged
(4000 rpm for 2 min) to remove the ZnO/rGO photocatalyst. The quantity
of dye in the aqueous solution was determined by measuring the absorption
intensity of Orange II at 485 nm.

To investigate the active
species photoproduced during the degradation process, experiments
were conducted using tert-butanol (t-BuOH, 10 mM), p-benzoquinone (0.1 mM), potassium
peroxodisulfate (K2S2O8, 10 mM),
and ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4, 10 mM) as scavengers of •OH and O2•– free radicals, electrons, and
holes, respectively.

4.7 Instruments and Characterization
TEM studies were conducted with a JEOL ARM 200F-Cold FEG TEM/STEM.
HR-TEM imaging was performed with a JEOL ARM 200F-Cold FEG fitted
with a GIF Quantum ER. Electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments
were recorded in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
mode. The EF-TEM images were recorded in the STEM mode. For each sample,
one drop of particles dispersed in ethanol was deposited on holey
carbon grids and imaged. SEM pictures were recorded using a JEOL JSM-6490
LV Microscope. The element mapping of the ZnO/rGO photocatalyst was
detected by EDX analysis. Crystal phases of samples were identified
using an X’Pert MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm). The specific surface areas, pore sizes, and
pore volumes of the samples were characterized by N2 absorption
using a Micromeritics 3Flex Surface Characterization Analyzer instrument.
Before the analyses, the samples were out-gassed overnight under primary
vacuum at 40 °C, followed by 4 h out-gassing under high vacuum.
Data were analyzed using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, and the micropore volume (Vmicro) was determined using the Horvath–Kawazoe equation. The ζ
potential of ZnO/rGO particles was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS equipment. The thermal stabilities of the samples were analyzed
using a TGA STA 449 F3 Jupiter equipment (Netzsch), and acquisitions
were conducted from 20 to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

All of the optical measurements were performed at room temperature
under ambient conditions. UV–visible absorption spectra of
liquid samples were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Evolution 220
spectrophotometer. UV–visible DR spectra were recorded on a
Shimadzu 2600 spectrophotometer within the wavelength range of 250–1400
nm. BaSO4 powder was used as a standard for baseline measurements.
Raman spectra were acquired using a Horiba Scientific Xplora spectrometer
at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
