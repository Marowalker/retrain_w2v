Chemical optimization of organic
compounds produces a series of
analogues. In addition to considering an analogue series (AS) or multiple
series on a case-by-case basis, which is often done in the practice
of chemistry, the extraction of analogues from compound repositories
is of high interest in organic and medicinal chemistry. In organic
chemistry, ASs are a source of alternative synthetic routes and also
aid in exploring relationships between compounds from different sources
including synthetic vs. naturally occurring molecules. In medicinal
chemistry, ASs are the major source of structure–activity relationship
information and of hits or leads for drug development. ASs might be
identified in different ways. For a given reference compound, a substructure
search can be carried out using its scaffold. Alternatively, matched
molecular pairs can be calculated to retrieve analogues from a compound
repository. However, if no query compounds are used, the identification
of ASs in databases is a difficult task. Herein, we introduce a computational
approach to systematically identify ASs in collections of organic
compounds. The approach involves compound decomposition on the basis
of well-established retrosynthetic rules, organization of compound–core
relationships, and identification of analogues sharing the same core.
The method was applied on a large scale to extract ASs from the ChEMBL
database, yielding more than 30 000 distinct series.

1 Introduction
In medicinal chemistry,
hit-to-lead and lead optimization campaigns
produce a series of analogues. An analogue series (AS) is generally
defined as a series of compounds that share the same core structure
and carry different R-groups at single or multiple substitution sites.1 ASs are conventionally represented in R-group
tables and are the major source of structure–activity relationship
(SAR) information.1−4 They are usually investigated as individual series in the course
of chemical optimization. Computational methods have been introduced
to organize large ASs and monitor SAR progression.2−5

Going beyond the analysis
of individual ASs, another important
task is searching for analogues in compound libraries and databases.
If one is interested in identifying analogues of given reference compound(s),
substructure search approaches can be applied using the core structure
of a reference compound as a query.1,6 For example,
this might be attempted in hit expansion when searching for analogues
of an interesting active compound. Furthermore, analogues of reference
compounds can also be identified without a predefined core structure
by searching for matched molecular pairs (MMPs).7 An MMP is defined as a pair of compounds that are only
distinguished by a structural modification at a single site.8 This modification can be rationalized as the
exchange of a pair of substructures or a chemical transformation.9 To detect analogue relationships via MMPs, chemical
transformations are restricted in size to focus on typical R-group
replacements.7,10 MMPs can be efficiently generated
algorithmically,9 making MMP-based analogue
searching generally applicable7 and an
attractive alternative to substructure search methods.

A much
more difficult task than query-based analogue searching
is the identification of ASs in large compound data sets, without
prior knowledge. However, this task is highly relevant for knowledge
extraction from compounds and activity data. In medicinal chemistry,
one would like to identify and extract ASs of any composition from
heterogeneous compound sources to maximize SAR information retrieval
and provide templates for compound optimization. However, to the best
of our knowledge, only one computational method for the systematic
identification of ASs has so far been introduced.11 This approach is also based upon the MMP formalism. For
a given data set, all possible MMPs are generated and organized in
an MMP-based network in which nodes represent compounds and edges
pairwise MMP relationships. In this network, separate MMP clusters
(MMPCs) are formed by individual ASs that can hence be easily identified.11 Accordingly, this approach is termed herein
an MMP cluster (MMPC)-based method. In the simplest case, an AS from
a cluster is formed by a matching molecular series (MMS)12 having a single substitution site. However,
separate clusters in the MMP-based network can also be formed by multiple
and overlapping MMSs representing ASs with multiple substitution sites.11 In this case, each participating MMS contributes
a unique single site.

Herein, we introduce another computational
methodology for the
systematic identification of ASs in repositories of organic compounds,
which does not rely on the MMP formalism. Rather, it is based upon
the decomposition of single compounds according to well-established
retrosynthetic rules and subsequent organization of compound–core
relationships (CCRs). In a large-scale application, this new compound–core
relationship (CCR) method was applied to systematically extract ASs
from the ChEMBL database13 and compared
with the MMPC approach.

2 Results and Discussion
Extracting ASs from compound repositories without prior knowledge
or query compounds is a difficult task. The CCR method introduced
herein for systematically identifying ASs in databases of any composition
is conceptually simple and generally applicable. The method comprises
three sequential steps, including the generation of cores, exploration
of compound–core relationships, and identification of analogue
series, which are discussed in the following sections.

2.1 Methodological Concept
2.1.1 Generation of Cores
The primary
goal of the method is the identification of core structures and corresponding
analogues such that the compounds can be readily reconstructed from
the cores by substitutions at one or more sites and organized into
ASs. The basis for reconstruction is provided by systematically applying
combinations of possible bond deletions in each compound using retrosynthetic
rules.

Specifically, for each database compound, all possible
combinations of one to five (or any other predefined number of) bonds
are systematically subjected to retrosynthetic cleavage. Hence, a
maximum number of five substitution sites per AS are covered. Each
combination of applicable retrosynthetic rules leading to the corresponding
elimination of single or multiple bonds yields a potential core. The
core is considered valid if it consists of a single substructure containing
an individual end point (substitution site) for each cleaved bond. Figure 1 illustrates the
generation of cores for two analogues having two retrosynthetic cleavage
sites. In addition to the three cores obtained from each analogue
through retrosynthetic modification, each original compound is recorded
as a core with no cleavage sites. Substitution sites in cores are
recorded. Furthermore, it is required that the core and eliminated
fragments (substituents) meet a predefined size ratio. In our proof-of-concept
study presented herein, we applied the rule that the core must contain
at least two-thirds of the heavy atoms comprising the original compound.
In other words, the ratio of the number of heavy atoms in the core
to the sum of the total number of heavy atoms in all substituents
must be at least 2:1. If these requirements are met, a core is accepted
for further analysis. For a given database, all possible cores are
generated and then “generalized”. During the generalization
step, all substitution sites are disregarded by introducing hydrogen
atom substitutions at each site such that different cores become identical
if they only differ in the position of substitution sites. In Figure 1, two identical cores
resulting from generalization are highlighted.

Figure 1 Concept of the compound–core
relationship method. The schematic
representation illustrates the identification of analogue series using
the CCR approach. For two exemplary compounds (left), all possible
cores are shown resulting from the application of retrosynthetic rules
and replacement of substitution sites with hydrogen atoms (generalization).
In compounds (left), sites of retrosynthetic bond elimination are
indicated by red lines. In cores (middle), generalized substitution
sites are indicated by red hydrogen atoms. For the two analogues,
the largest identical generalized cores and the reconstructed core
with two substitution sites (right) are encircled (purple). The reconstructed
core contains the invariant sulfonamide group.

2.1.2 Exploration of Compound–Core Relationships
Original database compounds that are identical to hydrogen-substituted
cores are assigned to the corresponding cores as the smallest possible
analogues. Generalization of cores is followed by reconstruction of
recorded substitution sites and the assignment of additional database
compounds to cores that differ at given substitution sites. The generalization
and reconstruction steps ensure that compounds with all possible substitutions
are assigned to corresponding cores, for example, analogues with ortho-,
meta-, and/or para-substitution at one or more rings. We note that
this cannot be accomplished on the basis of MMPs. The assignment of
compounds to cores with reconstructed substitution sites yields all
possible compound–core relationships in an organized form. Figure 1 illustrates the
reconstruction of a single core with two substitution sites representing
two exemplary analogues.

2.1.3 Identification of Analogue
Series
An AS is formed if at least two compounds are associated
with a core.
Because all possible cores meeting the acceptance criteria are involved
in CCRs, analogues forming an AS are often associated with multiple
cores. ASs might consist of distinct sets of analogues, i.e., analogues
belonging to one and only one AS, or overlapping sets of compounds.
In addition, an AS might be fully contained as a subset in another
series. The latter case is disambiguated by removal of ASs forming
a subset of another. In addition, if two ASs contain exactly the same
analogues, the one associated with the largest core is retained.

Other possible cases must also be taken into consideration. Figure 2a illustrates the
frequently observed situation that an AS is associated with multiple
cores. One of the cores might represent the entire AS and others subsets
of analogues comprising the series. In this case, the core associated
with the entire AS is retained to represent the series.

Figure 2 Compound–core
relationships and identification of analogue
series. (a) AS associated with three retrosynthetic cores. The core
at the top represents all analogues (depicted on a purple background),
whereas the two remaining cores represent two analogues each (encircled
in green and red, respectively). (b) Two overlapping ASs are shown,
each of which is associated with an individual core. The core at the
top represents four analogues (depicted on a purple background) and
the core at the bottom three (encircled in red). One of the analogues
is shared by both series.

Figure 2b
shows
an example of overlapping ASs having different cores. The series share
one analogue that is associated with both cores. This example also
illustrates the rationale for consistently applying core/substituents
size ratio restrictions. We note that the smaller core at the bottom
in Figure 2b is a substructure
of the larger one at the top. Due to the applied 2:1 size ratio restriction,
the three analogues at the top are not presented by the small core
at the bottom. This provides a basis for separating the series into
two smaller ASs. The confined set of six analogues in this example
could have been easily combined into a single AS by assigning two
cores to the series. However, application of the size ratio restriction
as a criterion for separating overlapping series generally avoids
the situation that increasingly large compounds associated with cores
that are substructures of each other form elongated “pseudo-AS”
that might be artificial in nature and not meaningful chemically.
Albeit rarely observed (see Section 2.2), this possible complication should strictly
be avoided to ensure chemical relevance of computed ASs. Therefore,
in overlapping ASs, each analogue is assigned to the largest AS it
belongs to and removed from others. If the number of compounds in
alternative ASs is the same, the AS associated with the larger core
is selected. Furthermore, if the cores have an identical size, preference
is given to the one with fewer substitution sites. Application of
these criteria ensures that nearly all overlapping series are disambiguated,
as further discussed below. The protocol outlined above guarantees
that each AS is ultimately associated with a single core and each
compound is associated with no more than one AS. Distinguishing between
different CCRs is also of practical relevance. The consistent association
of analogues and cores on the basis of size ratio restrictions and
the selection of largest possible cores ensures that newly identified
ASs are well-defined and can be easily represented in standard R-group tables, as
illustrated in Figure 3. Hence, such ASs are readily available for follow-up analysis in
medicinal chemistry.

R-group table for an AS with three substitution sites (R1–R3) is shown. Six exemplary analogues are listed.

2.2 Evaluation
2.2.1 Large-Scale
Search Application
In a proof-of-concept application, the
CCR method was applied to
systematically search for ASs in 244 704 active compounds from
the ChEMBL database (for details, see the Materials
and Methods section). A total of 30 431 ASs containing
145 269 compounds were identified, 8359 of which contained
cores with multiple substitution sites. Table 1 reports the size distribution of these ASs,
90% containing between two andnine analogues, 7.5% containing between
10 and 19, and 2.5% containing more than 19 analogues. Furthermore,
with increasing size, the proportion of ASs with multiple substitution
sites and the average number of substitution sites per AS also increased.
For example, the 768 ASs containing at least 20 analogues included
380 series with multiple substitution sites and had on average close
to two substitution sites per AS (with a maximum of sites).

Table 1 Composition of Analogue Series Identified

>19	768 (2.5%)	380 (49.5%)	1.93	
a Reported are the size distribution
of ASs and the fraction of ASs per size range having multiple substitution
sites. In addition, the average number of substitution sites per AS
of increasing size is given.

Importantly, 18 606 (61%) of the identified ASs containing
64 323 compounds were nonoverlapping and associated with a
single core representing the entire series, corresponding to the example
shown in Figure 2a.
Furthermore, 11 825 ASs (39%) containing 80 946 compounds
were obtained from a set of 24 202 initially overlapping AS,
as illustrated in Figure 2b. Most of the overlapping ASs were separated into well-defined
series by uniquely assigning each compound to a single core. Disambiguation
(as detailed above) was not possible for a very small subset of 96
overlapping ASs, 82 of which contained less than five compounds.

Thus, taken together, the results of systematic search calculations
using the CCR method revealed that the  majority of newly identified
ASs was distinct from others. In  cases where series overlap
was detected, separation into nonoverlapping ASs was mostly unambiguous.
Pseudo-ASs were not detected.

2.2.2 Method
Comparison
For comparison,
search calculations on the basis of 244 704 ChEMBL compounds
were repeated using the MMPC approach,11 the only other computational methodology available to date for systematically
identifying ASs. The results are reported in Table 2. MMPC calculations identified 22 111
ASs that covered a total of 103 154 ChEMBL compounds. These
series included 3509 ASs (15.9%) with multiple substitution sites.
In contrast, the CCR search calculations detected 30 431 ASs
that covered a total of 145 326 compounds and included 8359
ASs (27.5%) with multiple substitution sites. Most of the ASs obtained
by MMPC were also detected using the CCR method, with some variation
in the composition of individual (especially larger) series. Moreover,
nearly all analogues (97%) obtained by MMPC were identified using
the CCR approach, which yielded 45 508 additional analogues.
MMPC calculations yielded 2191 ASs comprising 10 or more analogues.
Of these series, 1986 ASs (91%) having more than 50% compound overlap
were also identified by CCR including 1406 ASs with at least 80% compound
overlap and 730 identical ASs. The overlap was calculated as the Jaccard
index, i.e., the ratio of the number of shared analogues to the total
number of unique analogues in a pair of corresponding series. CCR
calculations identified a total of 3040 ASs with 10 or more analogues
including 1352 ASs that were not detected using MMPC.

a For the MMPC and CCR methods, the
total number of ASs extracted from ChEMBL, the number of compounds
forming these ASs, and the number (percentage) of ASs with multiple
substitution sites are reported.

The MMPC/CCR comparison showed that the CCR method identified a
significantly larger number of ASs, with a larger proportion of series
having multiple substitution sites, and achieved a larger global compound
coverage.

2.4 Conclusions
The
identification of
ASs in compound repositories without prior knowledge is of considerable
relevance for the practice of organic and medicinal chemistry. ASs
and the associated activity information can be used to rationalize
and/or guide chemical synthesis and optimization efforts. However,
only little has been done so far to automatically identify and extract
ASs from databases, leaving much room for further developments. Herein,
we have introduced a new computational approach to systematically
search for ASs. The CCR method relies on the decomposition of single
compounds on the basis of retrosynthetic rules, systematic generation
of cores and compound–core relationships, and identification
of ASs on the basis of organized and prioritized relationships. By
design, the methodology is conceptually simple yet generally applicable.
As such, it is thought to represent an attractive addition to the
current repertoire of computational methods with utility for organic
and medicinal chemistry. In our proof-of-concept investigation, a
systematic search for ASs in ChEMBL identified a large number of ASs.
The majority of ASs were nonoverlapping and distinct from others and
associated with an individual core representing the entire AS. Such
series should be of considerable interest for further SAR analysis
and the identification of target-selective or promiscuous compounds.
In summary, the CCR method introduced herein represents a new and
general approach for systematically identifying ASs. It should be
of interest to computational as well as organic and medicinal chemists
including investigators aiming to explore relationships between compounds
from different sources such as natural products and synthetic compounds.
Such analyses will provide interesting topics for future application-oriented
research.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Retrosynthetic Rules
As retrosynthetic
rules for compound decomposition, a well-established set of 13 retrosynthetic
combinatorial analysis procedure (RECAP) rules was applied.14 We emphasize that the CCR methodology does not
depend on a given set of rules. Depending on individual preferences
or project requirements, any chosen set of reaction/retrosynthetic
rules can be used. This is particularly relevant for applications
in organic chemistry when new synthesis schemes are explored and compared
with others.

3.2 Core Generation Details
The systematic
generation of cores is among the three central components of the CCR
method. Further details are provided. Bonds in compounds are cleaved
according to RECAP rules and respective substituents are removed.
If multiple RECAP rules are applicable to a given compound, all possible
combinations are explored to generate cores. For example, if three
rules A, B, and C apply, seven cores are obtained, including three
with single cleavage sites (A, B, and C), three with dual sites (A/B,
A/C, and B/C), and one with three cleavage sites (A/B/C). However,
cores are only accepted to establish compound–core relationships
if the ratio of the number of heavy atoms forming the core to the
number of heavy atoms of all eliminated substituents is at least 2:1.
The number of bonds in a compound to which RECAP rules applied was
limited (and rarely larger than 20). Consequently, the exhaustive
exploration of all possible combinations and resulting cores did not
pose a combinatorial problem in most cases. In addition, the 2:1 size
ratio restriction further reduced the number of cores for analyzing
compound–core relationships. Nonetheless, a computational time
restriction of 100 s per compound was implemented for core generation.
However, due to this constraint, only 629 of 244 704 ChEMBL
compounds failed to produce cores. The protocol for compound decomposition
according to retrosynthetic rules was implemented in Java with the
aid of the OEChem toolkit.15

3.3 Implementation of the CCR Algorithm
The CCR algorithm
for systematically identifying ASs, as detailed
in the Results and Discussion section, was
implemented in Python.

3.4 Searching for Analogue
Series
Systematic
search calculations using the CCR and MMPC reference methods were
carried out in a curated version of ChEMBL release 23.13 Only compounds with direct interactions (target
relationship type “D”) with human targets at the highest
confidence level (target confidence score 9) and available Ki or IC50 values were selected, yielding
a total of 244 704 active compounds. The application of these
selection criteria was not essential for the analysis but ensured
that detected ASs exclusively consisted of compounds for which meaningful
activity data were available.
