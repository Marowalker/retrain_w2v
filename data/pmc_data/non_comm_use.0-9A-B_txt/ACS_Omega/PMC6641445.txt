Ruthenium
catalysts have been found to be of great use for many
kinds of reactions. Understanding the details of the catalytic cycle
allows to not only rationalize experimental results but also to improve
upon reactions. Herein, we present a detailed computational study
of a ruthenium-catalyzed coupling between a terminal alkyne and an
aldehyde. The reaction under examination facilitates novel access
to olefins with the concurrent loss of a single carbon as carbon monoxide.
The reaction was first developed in 2009, but the tentative mechanism
initially proposed was proven to be contradictory to some experimental
data obtained since then. Using a combination of computational investigations
and isotope-labeling experiments, several potential mechanisms have
been studied. In contrast to the [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism suggested
for similar catalysts, we propose a new consensus pathway that proceeds
through the formation of a ruthenium–vinylidene complex that
undergoes an aldol-type reaction with the aldehyde to yield the product
olefins. Computational insights into the influence of different reagents
used to optimize reaction conditions and the intricacies of decarbonylation
of a Ru–CO complex affecting catalyst turnover are highlighted.

Introduction
Coupling reactions
forming carbon–carbon double bonds are
some of the most important processes in organic chemistry. They have
found wide application for the synthesis of electronic materials,
bioactive natural products, pharmaceuticals, and feedstock for various
chemical transformations. Over the years, numerous methodologies have
been developed for these useful reactions.1−7 One of the most successful methods to generate C=C bonds
was discovered by Wittig and Geissler in 1953,8 and reacts carbonyls and phosphonium ylides to produce olefins.
Wittig olefination and its complementary variations9−13 are widely used in both industry and research laboratories.
However, the use of stoichiometric amounts of ylides, rather low atom
economy, and generation of phosphine oxide as a problematic byproduct
has, in recent times, created economic and environmental concerns
and limited this once ubiquitous process. Many of these limitations
have been obviated by the discovery of catalytic Heck-type reactions,
olefin metathesis protocols, and other catalytic methodologies.14−20 These reactions often use organometallic complexes to catalyze the
chemical transformations because transition metals can provide efficient
ways to make and break chemical bonds, sometimes between groups that
would otherwise be inert.21 Ruthenium is
in general an attractive transition metal to use in different kinds
of catalysis due to the stability of its complexes with organic ligands
in air and with respect to moisture.22

A few years back, we have reported a method for C=C bond
formation involving ruthenium-catalyzed coupling of aromatic aldehydes
with terminal alkynes to produce olefins in moderate to excellent
yields (Scheme 1A).23 This reaction is atom-economical (loss of only
carbon monoxide), utilizes easily available starting materials, and
does not require any additional activation. When suggesting a possible
catalytic cycle, we based our hypotheses on previously reported mechanisms
for similar catalysts. More specifically, inspired by numerous reports
on ruthenium-catalyzed hydroacylation reactions resulting in acyl–hydrido–ruthenium
complexes,24−27 decarbonylation of aldehydes,28,29 and migratory insertion
of nucleophiles to ruthenium bound alkynes,22,30−33 we proposed that a decarbonylative addition mechanism is at play
(Scheme 1B). In that
tentative mechanism, the key elementary steps are oxidative addition
of RuII to the aromatic aldehyde C–H bond to form
a RuIV–acyl intermediate, decarbonylation of RuIV–acyl complex to form a (CO)RuIV–aryl
complex, and migratory insertion of the aryl group to the metal bound
alkyne terminal carbon.23 There are several
examples of late transition metal catalyzed aldehyde C–H activation,
followed by the formation of the metal hydrido-acyl species that are
participating in migratory insertion into a C=C bond to ultimately
generate a ketone34−37 or undergoing reductive decarbonylation to generate saturated C–C
bonds (RCHO to R–R) or C–H bonds (RCHO to R–H).38−40 In addition, we developed a rhodium-catalyzed coupling of aromatic
aldehyde to norbornene to form a saturated C–C bond,41 where the reaction was shown to proceed via
aldehyde decarbonylation.

Scheme 1 Ruthenium-Catalyzed (A) Coupling of Aromatic
Aldehydes and Terminal
Alkynes To Form Olefins, Using Optimized Conditions23 and (B) Tentative Reaction Mechanism Proposed Previously
Other groups, working with
similar catalysts, have proposed other
mechanisms for this type of coupling reaction. Saá and co-workers
developed an intramolecular version (Scheme 2A) with a ruthenium-catalyzed and Brønsted
acid–promoted cyclization of terminal alkynals to cycloalkenes.42 It was proposed that the reaction proceeds through
the formation of a ruthenium–vinylidene species, which follows
an aldol-type reaction to generate the final cycloalkene product (Scheme 2B). In a related
computational study, Zhang et al. have suggested that the reaction,
shown in Scheme 2A,
proceeds through the formation of a four-membered ring (Scheme 2C).43 The mechanism was further supported by the isolation of an osmium
oxetylidene complex (Figure 2D) by Esteruelas and co-workers a few years later as key intermediate
in a similar intramolecular coupling.44 Interestingly, the corresponding ruthenium complex has not yet been
isolated, but a detailed mechanistic study leading to a catalytic
cycle featuring this intermediate has been reported.45 These differences between the intra- and intermolecular
olefination reaction mechanisms have created a debate, addressed in
a highlight by Allen and Williams.46 In
the intramolecular reaction, the terminal carbon of the alkyne is
lost as CO (Scheme 2B), whereas our tentative intermolecular reaction mechanism instead
dictates the loss of aldehyde-originating CO (Scheme 1B). It should be noted that the conditions
employed for both reactions are markedly different, which makes alternate
operational mechanisms entirely plausible. In fact, the catalytic
system for the intramolecular reaction does not produce any corresponding
olefination product for the intermolecular reaction. Furthermore,
the reactions explored by Saá and co-workers were carried out
without water, whereas the corresponding intermolecular coupling requires
small amounts of water.

To reconcile
the mechanistic differences, and to further develop
this olefination into a more applicable synthetic tool, a detailed
computational investigation of the reaction mechanism using quantum
chemical methods was undertaken. To support the modeling, isotope-labeling
studies as well as control experiments were carried out. In this contribution,
we present (i) the rationale and (ii) computational insights into
the reaction mechanisms, reaction stereoselectivity, importance of
singlet and triplet ruthenium spin states, and intricacies of decarbonylation
of a Ru–CO complex affecting the catalyst turnover.

Results
and Discussion
Testing our Proposed Mechanism
The
tentative mechanism
we previously proposed23 (Scheme 1B) is initiated by the formation
of the active monomeric catalyst (I) from the polymeric
starting material. This step is followed by the coordination of the
alkyne to the metal, forming intermediate II. The next
step proceeds through the oxidative addition of the RuII to the aldehyde C–H bond to form intermediate III. The subsequent decarbonylation of the RuIV–acyl
complex forms intermediate IV, which then collapses to V by a migratory insertion of the aryl group to the alkyne
terminal carbon. The final step proceeds through a reductive elimination
to generate the product. According to this mechanism, both alkyne
sp carbons are conserved in the product olefin and the aldehyde acyl
carbon is lost as CO (marked in red on Scheme 1B).

To test this hypothesis, we used
the reagents that cannot undergo all of the proposed reaction steps.
For example, the first productive step is the oxidative addition of
the ruthenium complex to the aldehyde C–H bond. Thus, the reaction
should not lead to a product if a ketone is used instead of an aldehyde.
However, upon reacting acetophenone with 1-decyne (under previously
optimized conditions) produced the trisubstituted olefin ((E and Z)-undec-2-en-2-ylbenzene) in 10%
yield with 15% conversion of the ketone (Scheme 3A). This experiment confirmed that the presence
of an aldehyde C–H was not required for the success of the
reaction and that the reaction most likely does not proceed through
the oxidative addition step (II–III). It is worth noting that trisubstituted alkenes are valuable synthetic
intermediate and their regio- and stereoselective synthesis is generally
accepted to be more challenging than that of mono- and disubstituted
alkenes.13,47

Scheme 3 (A) Reaction of Acetophenone with 1-Decyne
and (B) Reaction of 4-Anisaldehyde
without 1-Decyne, Using Optimized Conditions23
According to the proposed mechanism
in Scheme 1B, the aldehyde
initiates the reaction (formation
of III and IV) through oxidative addition
of the RuII to the aldehyde C–H bond and subsequent
decarbonylation of the RuIV–acyl complex. In the
absence of alkyne, a complex similar to IV can proceed
through a reductive elimination step to form Ar–H.40,48 However, under optimized conditions, 4-anisaldehyde did not produce
any detectable anisole and instead resulted in the recovery of 85%
of the starting material (Scheme 3B).

Based on these experiments, it can be concluded
that the reaction
does not proceed through the initial activation of aldehyde and that
the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 1B can be ruled out.

An Alternative Mechanism:
[2+2] Cycloaddition
The mechanism
similar to the one proposed by Zhang et al.,43 where the critical intermediate is a ruthenium coordinated oxetane,
was next investigated by computational means. As suggested by Saá
and co-workers, the catalytic cycle begins after the activation of
the terminal alkyne by RuII to generate a ruthenium–vinylidene
intermediate. Note that the formation of the vinylidene through a
hydrogen migration onto ruthenium was found unlikely by Zhang. Alternatively,
compound VI (Figure 1A) proposed here can be obtained via, for example,
a direct 1,2-hydrogen migration or by a two-step process where the
first step is the the oxidative addition of the alkyne sp C–H
bond to the metal and the second is the dissociative 1,3-hydrogen
migration,49−53 along with other bimolecular pathways.54,55 A ruthenium–vinylidene complex (VI, Figure 1B) formation, that
has been previously studied,56 was used
as a starting point for our modeling.

Figure 1 (A) Formation of ruthenium–vinylidene
complex VI; model of complex VI in closed
(B) and open (C) geometries.

To effectively model complex VI and the subsequent
steps of the reaction, the long alkane chain C8H17 of 1-decyne (used in all of the experiments) was reduced in size
to three carbons. This reduced the computational cost while retaining
the bulkiness of the structure. The ruthenium–vinylidene complex
was found to have two stable conformations in a singlet spin state
5.9 kcal/mol apart: a closed one (Figure 1B) and an open one (Figure 1C, higher in energy). The next steps of the
new pathway were modeled using the lowest-energy structure of complex VI (closed).

A common [2+2] mode of cycloaddition of
metal–vinylidene
complexes with unsaturated moieties involves the formation of metallacycles
(via the addition to the M=Cα bond).53,57,58 In our case, however, this pathway
cannot lead to the desired C–C connectivity, and it was not
considered. One possibility is the incorporation of the Cα=Cβ bond in the metal–vinylidene complexes.53,59−63Scheme 4 depicts
a proposed mechanism where the first step is the [2+2] cyclization
between ruthenium–vinylidene and benzaldehyde to form an oxetylidene
intermediate VII. Aided by water acting as an acid/base,
this intermediate proceeds to form an α-hydroxy-RuII carbene-type intermediate (VIII), which can then undergo
a keto–enol tautomerization to form an α,β-unsaturated-carbonyl
intermediate (IX). The intermediate IX proceeds
through decarbonylation (IX–X) and
reductive elimination to form the product olefins.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanism
for Olefin Formation through the Intermediacy
of a [2+2] Adduct
The formation of oxetylidene intermediate VII was
modeled in both the cis and the trans configurations. This transformation might occur in a stepwise manner:
first, the carbon–oxygen bond is formed via an edge-to-face
TS, then the carbon–carbon bond forms via a second TS (as described
by Zhang et al. (Scheme 2C)). However, although the energy barriers computed were not high
(15.9 kcal/mol), the transition structures identified were not first-order
saddle points on the potential energy surface; two imaginary frequencies
corresponding to the correct bond formation were present. Moreover,
the optimization of the intermediate structure resulting from the
C–O bond formation yielded an unstable molecule, which coordinated
with a chloride ligand of the catalyst (Scheme 5). From there, the second step of the reaction
to form a four-member ring was geometrically impossible. Although
this mechanism was put forward in the literature and did not contradict
the previous experimental findings (Scheme 3), the instability of the reaction intermediate
necessary for the following oxygen–carbon bond formation suggests
that a different pathway should be considered.

Scheme 5 [2+2] Cycloaddition:
Unstable Intermediate in the Formation of VII
Efforts to optimize the TS were unsuccessful, so we reverted
to
experiments and ran a control experiment where water was replaced
by methanol. In Scheme 4, water acts as an acid/base to promote the opening of the four-member
cycle to produce intermediate VIII; therefore, in the
presence of a molecule sharing some but not all of water’s
properties (acid/base and nucleophile), this mechanism is expected
to slow down, yet still yielding the product. When the experiment
was repeated, this time replacing water by methanol, the product was
not observed. This experimental result together with our computational
observations suggests that the [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism (Scheme 4) is unlikely.

An Alternative Mechanism: Aldol-type Condensation
Because
the activation of the terminal alkyne by the ruthenium catalyst seemed
reasonable, a second mechanism beginning with the formation of complex VI was proposed. In Scheme 6, the reaction proceeds through the hydration of the
ruthenium–vinylidene double bond to form a formal α-hydroxyvinyl-RuIV–hydride species (XI). The next step
consists in an aldol-type reaction between complex XI and the aldehyde to form the β-hydroxy-ketone intermediate XII. In general, ruthenium–vinylidene and other late
transition metal–vinylidenes are considered electrophilic in
nature. Electrophilicity here is a property that is dependent on the
nature of the ligands. Metal–vinylidenes have been shown to
participate in attack by nucleophiles on the Cα (directly
bonded to metal) and electrophilic attack on the Cβ,42,53,64−66 which is in line with the mechanism proposed here. The complex XII then undergoes a reductive elimination to produce the cis- and trans-olefins, water as well as
carbon monoxide to regenerate the catalyst.

Scheme 6 Proposed Mechanism
for Olefin Formation through an Aldol-type Condensation
Attack on metal–vinylidene
complexes by water is well documented,
although the exact mechanism has not been explicitly addressed:67−71 a α-hydroxyvinyl-RuIV–hydride species similar
to XI has been implicated as an intermediate during the
ruthenium-catalyzed hydration of 1-alkynes to yield aldehydes. Our
modeling suggests that it is in fact not one but two water molecules
that are at play. Interestingly, following the coordination of one
water molecule VI rearranges into its open conformation
(Figure 2A). The coordination of water proceeds without a TS
and stabilizes the metal complex by 8.8 kcal/mol.

Figure 2 Three-dimensional (3D)
models of intermediates (A) VI in open conformation with
a coordinated water molecule and (B) transition
state (TS) to produce XI.

As a result of this coordination, the α carbon becomes
available
for attack by another water molecule, which requires an energy of
activation of 17.0 kcal/mol. At this stage, the formation of XI is incomplete because the hydrogen atom of water is still
not bonded to the ruthenium metal center (Figure 2B). To achieve this, the system should change
its multiplicity from a singlet to a triplet. This type of transition
is usually forbidden, unless the triplet and the singlet potential
energy surfaces come close in energy and the system benefits from
spin–orbit coupling effect.72 The
singlet and triplet potential surfaces were found to cross and the
energy barrier for the S → T transition was determined to be
8.5 kcal/mol. The spin crossing transition results in the dissociation
of one chloride ligand from the metal complex. However, the proton
transfer needed to complete the formation of XI had an
unexpectedly high energy (>20 kcal/mol). Therefore, the formation
of this complex was deemed improbable.

In light of this finding,
the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 6 needed to be adjusted,
producing Scheme 7.
The loss of chloride leaves the catalyst in a tetrahedral geometry
(XIII), which can react with the aldehyde in an aldol
fashion, forming XIV. The last transformation required
to yield the products is the association of the chloride back onto
the catalyst and the proton transfer onto the olefin. The energy barrier
of the aldol step is estimated to 16.0 and 14.6 kcal/mol for the formation
of (R,S)-XIV and (S,S)-XIV, respectively. The
resulting intermediate XIV, illustrated in 3D in Scheme 7, shows that the
atoms that will be eliminated in the subsequent stage of the reaction
lie in the same plane (torsion angle = 178°). This conformation
is favorable for an E2 elimination of water to produce XV.

the 3D Structure of Intermediate XIV
The
atoms that will be undergo

so an E2 would be possible.

Deuterium-Labeling
Experiments
To support the mechanistic
hypothesis shown in Scheme 7, a series of isotope-labeling experiments were performed.
The coupling between benzaldehyde and 2H-1-decyne resulted
in the desired product with scrambling of proton isotope information
for the hydrogen bonded to Cβ (Scheme 8A) but not on the hydrogen bonded to Cα. This experiment supports the hypothesis that the elimination
step proceeds as described in Scheme 7, which allows proton scrambling on Cβ, unlike Scheme 6,
where the proton of the 1-decyne is retained throughout the reaction.

Scheme 8 (A) Reaction of Benzaldehyde with 2H-1-Decyne and Benzaldehyde,
(B) Reaction of Benzaldehyde with 1-Decyne in the Presence of D2O, No Other Additive, and (C) Reaction of Benzaldehyde with
1-Decyne in the Presence of D2O, Optimized Conditions
In our previous report on this
ruthenium catalyst,23 the reaction of benzaldehyde
with 1-decyne in the presence
of deuterated water, but without CuCl2 or LiCl, resulted
in no incorporation of deuterium in the final product (Scheme 8B). However, when the same
experiment was repeated with LiCl, a small incorporation of deuterium
in the olefin product was noticed (Scheme 8C). According to the mechanism in Scheme 7, a small amount
of deuterated olefin would be produced both with and without LiCl.
Puzzled by these results, we re-examined the role of additives in
the reaction.

Based on the results from the deuterium-labeling
experiments shown
in Scheme 8B,C, it
can be concluded that the presence of LiCl and CuCl2 promotes
the mechanism described in Scheme 7, whereas in the absence of these additives, a different
elimination reaction mechanism is in effect. For example, the formation
of carbon monoxide can release the product olefin with the retention
of 1-decyne proton (marked in red in Scheme 9A). Conversely, metals like lithium or copper
may chelate the aldol product XIV rendering the proton
on Cβ more acidic and leading to the elimination
of water containing a proton from the alkyne (Scheme 9B).

Scheme 9 Elimination Step of Aldol-type Mechanism
in the Absence (A) and Presence
(B) of LiCl or CuCl2
This difference is supported by the difference in atomic
charges
of this proton: +0.22 and +0.14 with and without LiCl, respectively.
The change in acidity is also indicated by the electrostatic surface
potential map (Figure 3), which shows how the presence of LiCl shifts the electron density.

potential of XIV plotted on an iso density
surface of the electron density set to 0.002 e/bohr3: (left)
with LiCl and (right) without LiCl coordination.

Catalyst Deactivation
The second to last steps of the
reaction mechanism in Scheme 7 is a decarbonylation. The loss of the terminal alkyne carbon
as CO through a ruthenium–vinylidene complex has previously
been reported, among others, for the intramolecular reaction in Scheme 1(42) and for the Ru(II)-mediated C–C cleavage of phenylacetylene
by water into toluene and a Ru(II)–CO complex.68 The analysis of the reaction mixture by IR spectroscopy
revealed multiple Ru–CO stretches for the reaction with H2O and a mixture of Ru–CO and Ru–C18O bands when the reaction was carried out in the presence of H218O, indicative of more than one CO occupying the
coordination sites of ruthenium. The mechanism of decarbonylation
of metal–acyl complexes often involves transfer of carbon monoxide
directly onto the metal23,73 and its subsequent
release through ligand exchange. A potential energy scan of the loss
of CO shows that this elimination is not energetically favorable (Figure S1). Clearly, the π-backbonding
of carbon monoxide to ruthenium is strong, blocking the metal coordination
sites, and leading to catalyst deactivation. This finding tentatively
explains the requirement of a high catalyst loading (10 mol % Ru)
for the optimized reaction conditions.

Final Mechanism
To summarize our findings on this coupling
reaction, the main steps of the final proposed mechanism as well as
their relative energies are shown in Figure 4. First, the catalyst forms a ruthenium–vinylidene
intermediate VI, which can take several ligand configurations.
The open configuration of VI, stabilized by a water molecule,
reacts with another water molecule to produce the hydroxyvinyl-RuII species XIII. This intermediate can undergo
a spin state transition from singlet to triplet, which is its more
stable configuration. In the presence of an aldehyde, hydroxyvinyl-RuII reacts in an aldol fashion to yield (R,S)-XIV and (S,S)-XIV, which will generate the cis-
and the trans-olefin products, respectively, at the
end of the catalytic cycle. The next steps of the reaction differ
depending on whether LiCl and/or CuCl2 is added. In fact,
in the absence of these additives (marked in blue in Figure 4), intermediate XIV releases the product olefins and forms a strong bond with a newly
formed carbon monoxide (XVII). The loss of CO allows
the regeneration of the catalyst, but the high energy required to
release this ligand leads to partial catalyst deactivation. On the
other hand, LiCl and/or CuCl2 additives act as Lewis acids,
which can stabilize the aldol product XIV, rendering
the proton on Cβ more acidic. This stabilization
favors the elimination of a water molecule producing intermediate XV (marked in green in Figure 4). The loss of the terminal alkyne carbon as carbon
monoxide, yielding XVI, and the release of product olefins
regenerate the catalyst and complete the catalytic cycle.

Figure 4 Changes in
Gibbs energy for the reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 7. For clarity, the
reaction pathway leading to only the cis product olefin is shown.
The blue curve displays the energy changes for Scheme 9A, whereas the green curves show the energy
changes for Scheme 9B. Dashed curves mean only ground-state structures were computed.

Conclusions
We
have reported in-depth computational studies to elucidate the
mechanism of a ruthenium-catalyzed decarbonylative coupling reaction
between an aromatic aldehyde and terminal alkyne to produce olefins
supported by experimental data. Several possibilities were investigated
before the formulation of the final proposed mechanism (Scheme 7). Control experiments unequivocally
refute our initially proposed mechanism23 of the reaction being initiated by the aldehyde C–H activation
and the subsequent decarbonylation of aldehyde acyl carbon as CO.
The only other chemically feasible pathway is the initial activation
of the terminal alkyne to form a ruthenium–vinylidene complex,
which can produce olefin products either by a [2+2]-cycloaddition
or an aldol-type condensation. The combined experimental and computational
data suggest that this reaction proceeds via an aldol-type pathway
and the concomitant loss of the terminal alkyne carbon as carbon monoxide,
thus closing this mechanistic debate. The density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, supported by the IR data, implicate the catalyst
deactivation as a result of strong binding with CO, as has been proposed
for other ruthenium-based catalytic systems.74 The effect of LiCl and CuCl2 additives on the reaction
mechanism has been explained using the electrostatic potential maps
and isotope-labeling experiments. This new mechanistic proposal highlights
the complexity of these ruthenium catalysts that operate in such different
reaction conditions leading to distinct mechanisms.

Experimental
Section
Computational Methodology
All calculations were performed
using ORCA.75 Optimizations and frequency
calculations were performed using the hybrid exchange correlation
DFT method PBE0.76 The def2-SVP basis set
was used for all atoms, except ruthenium, chlorine, oxygen, lithium,
and carbon, directly involved in the reaction for which def2-TZVP
was used. All structures were optimized in the gas phase. Preliminary
calculations indicated that the inclusion of solvent (toluene) using
the polarizable continuum model did not affect the results. The dispersion
was also expected to only have a minor impact because we were not
investigating molecular properties such as NMR shifts or crystal packing
nor studying the systems bound by weak van der Waals forces. The reactants
used to model this reaction were benzaldehyde and pent-1-yne. Note
that the alkane chain C8H17 of 1-decyne (used
in all experiments) was reduced in size to three carbons. The vibrational
modes calculations were performed to verify that all stationary points
have the appropriate number of imaginary frequencies (none for ground
state, one for TSs). The validity of TSs was verified by following
the corresponding normal mode and relaxing the resulting structure
to obtain the products and reactants of each step. The energies reported
are Gibbs energies, where the entropic component of the energy was
obtained from harmonic vibrational frequencies. The minimum energy
crossing point for the S → T transition was determined using
the SurfCrossOpt feature in ORCA.
