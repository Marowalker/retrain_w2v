A fundamental
re-assessment of the overall energetics of biochemical
electron transfer chains and cycles is presented, highlighting the
crucial role of the highest-energy molecule involved, O2. The chemical energy utilized by most complex multicellular organisms
is not predominantly stored in glucose or fat, but rather in O2 with its relatively weak (i.e., high-energy) double bond.
Accordingly, reactions of O2 with organic molecules are
highly exergonic, while other reactions of glucose, fat, NAD(P)H,
or ubiquinol (QH2) are not, as demonstrated in anaerobic
respiration with its meager energy output. The notion that “reduced
molecules” such as alkanes or fatty acids are energy-rich is
shown to be incorrect; they only unlock the energy of more O2, compared to O-containing molecules of similar mass. Glucose contains
a moderate amount of chemical energy per bond (<20% compared to
O2), as confirmed by the relatively small energy output
in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle converting glucose to CO2 and NADH. Only in the “terminal” aerobic respiration
reaction with O2 does a large free energy change occur
due to the release of oxygen’s stored chemical energy. The
actual reaction of O2 in complex IV of the inner mitochondrial
membrane does not even involve any organic fuel molecule and yet releases
>1 MJ when 6 mol of O2 reacts. The traditional presentation
that relegated O2 to the role of a low-energy terminal
acceptor for depleted electrons has not explained these salient observations
and must be abandoned. Its central notion that electrons release energy
because they move from a high-energy donor to a low-energy acceptor
is demonstrably false. The energies of (at least) two donor and two
acceptor species come into play, and the low “terminal”
negative reduction potential in aerobic respiration can be attributed
to the unusually high energy of O2, the crucial reactant.
This is confirmed by comparison with the corresponding half-reaction
without O2, which is endergonic. In addition, the electrons
are mostly not accepted by oxygen but by hydrogen. Redox energy transfer
and release diagrams are introduced to provide a superior representation
of the energetics of the various species in coupled half-reactions.
Electron transport by movement of reduced molecules in the electron
transfer chain is shown to run counter to the energy flow, which is
carried by oxidized species. O2, rather than glucose, NAD(P)H,
or ATP, is the molecule that provides the most energy to animals and
plants and is crucial for sustaining large complex life forms. The
analysis also highlights a significant discrepancy in the proposed
energetics of reactions of aerobic respiration, which should be re-evaluated.

Introduction
Bioenergetics
is an important area of biochemistry, accounting
for the energy driving biochemical reactions.1−8 While it is known, in principle, that only reactions with molecular
oxygen provide enough energy to make large complex organisms viable,9 biochemistry and biology textbooks assume without
proof that biochemical energy is stored in fuel molecules such as
glucose.1−5,8,10,11 In this paper, we demonstrate that this
view is incorrect since most of the energy is actually derived from
O2 with its relatively weak double bond.12

The fact that most chemical energy is associated
with chemical
bonds is acknowledged early on in many biochemistry texts1,2,4,5,8 and emphasized in the context of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). Molecules with relatively weak bonds store chemical
energy and release it when chemical reactions result in the formation
of the same number of stronger, lower-energy bonds. Since, according
to the traditional view, fuel molecules such as glucose or fat are
full of energy, a significant fraction of their stored energy should
be released when they decompose. However, compared to the combustion
reaction 1  decompositions of fuel molecules
are not strongly exergonic: 2a   2b   2c   2d   2e   2f   2g   2h  Double-primed quantities
were calculated under Alberty’s biological standard conditions
(at pH = 7);13,14 the relatively small differences
from the unprimed values7,15 or the single-primed
values at pH 716 are mostly entropic in
nature and inconsequential for our conclusions. Reactions of fuel
molecules in the absence of O2 are also not strongly exergonic,
even when a strongly bonded molecule such as CO2 is formed: 3a   3b   3c   3d  (for ΔrGo′ in eq 3a, see ref (16)). Other reactions of glucose
shown below have
a similarly meager energy output. By contrast, when organic molecules
react with O2, invariably a lot of energy is released: 4a   4b   4c   4d   4e  It is apparent from these
examples and others given below that more O2 in the reaction
results in the release of more energy,12,17−21 almost regardless of the nature of the fuel molecules or reaction
products. Note that several of the reactions with O2 shown,
as well as additional examples below, do not produce CO2 and yet are significantly exergonic. The obvious interpretation
of these observations is that a lot of chemical energy resides in
O2.12,20,21 We had previously shown, through a generalized bond-energy analysis,
that 418 kJ of heat is released per mole of O2 in the combustion
of organic molecules.12 The excellent agreement
of this analysis with the experimental data has convincingly documented
its validity.12 O2 provides
∼3/4 of the energy of combustion due to its relatively weak
σ-bonding (while the π-electrons are complicated but provide
strong bonding);22 the organic fuels contribute
only ∼1/4.12

While the generalized
bond-energy analysis12 has clearly proven
that O2 contains most of the chemical
energy in the biosphere, the established presentation of bioenergetics1−8,11 suggests the opposite. Energy
diagrams commonly show nutrients, in addition to sunlight, as the
energy sources of organisms and do not mention oxygen (see the Supporting Information for examples).1−5,8 “Reduced molecules”
are the supposed energy-rich species.1,5,6 In respiration, O2 is often called the
“terminal electron receptor”; it is shown with a low
“energy level” (negative of the standard reduction potential),6 which suggests a low-energy species, essentially
a receptacle for “used electrons”.23 The main goal of this paper is to show how the commonly
invoked electron transfer picture1−3,6 can be reconciled with O2 being the highest-energy molecule
(per bond) commonly found in the biosphere and how to correctly analyze
the overall energetics of electron transfer chains and the Krebs and
Calvin cycles.

Our analysis focuses on aerobic respiration since
its equivalence
to combustion, already quantitatively analyzed and explained,12 makes it easier to recognize the special role
of O2 as the main high-energy molecule in the biosphere.
Respiration processes will be presented in diagrams that correctly
reflect the flow of chemical energy from O2. It is shown
that the new analysis is not just an optional alternative view but
that the traditional reasoning is incorrect and must be replaced.
Recognizing O2 as the crucial high-energy molecule also
highlights discrepancies between free energy release and claimed ATP
production in different reactions of aerobic respiration.

Results and Discussion
Energetics
of Molecules in Aerobic Respiration
Summary of the Traditional
Presentation
We had previously
established that O2 is the most important high-energy molecule
in the biosphere,12 storing large amounts
of solar energy. What we analyze here is why this fact has not been
apparent in traditional descriptions of bioenergetics1−8,11 and how the presentation needs
to be changed.

Textbooks describe biochemical energetics at
three main levels:(i) Conceptual overviews of bioenergetics
show naïve statements and diagrams about sunlight and
nutrients providing the energy organisms need,1,2,8 and it is assumed without reflection that
organic fuel molecules contain the energy released in aerobic respiration.3−5,11

(ii) In more specific summaries of respiration
and photosynthesis reactions, the Gibbs free energy changes ΔrGo′ in overall reactions,
such as NADH + H+ + 1/2O2 → H2O + NAD+, are given but without meaningful explanation.
(We have shown that their main component, ΔrHo, can be quantitatively explained in terms
of the energy per electron-pair bond.12 In combustion and aerobic respiration, most of the energy derives
from the unusually weak double bond of O2.)

(iii) An electron transfer description
is given at length.1−3,6 In the description of
the electron transfer step by step, the origin of the large ΔrGo′ in aerobic respiration
is not discussed. This analysis does not even explicitly refer to
energies but rather to negative standard reduction potentials in volts.
It is “explained” in terms of differential electron
affinities or an “electron waterfall”.6,24



If students combine these concepts,
they may reasonably (but incorrectly)
conclude that the energy of combustion mostly derives from the bond
energies of organic “fuel” molecules and that the energy
differences are due to different electron affinities; for instance,
the final step of aerobic respiration with transfer of electrons to
oxygen is interpreted as the low-energy endpoint of the sequence of
reactions.1,3,6 In what ways
these conclusions are incorrect will be explained in the following.

Energy Released in Aerobic Respiration
The respiration
of glucose is summarized by the familiar reaction in eq 1 with ΔrGo = −2875 kJ/mol, and that of a fatty
acid (palmitic acid) by 5  while
the overall reaction
in the “electron transfer chain of oxidative phosphorylation”1 is 6  All three reactions are highly
exothermic and exergonic, which means that a lot of chemical energy
must have been stored in the bonds of the reactants that are broken
during the reaction (much more, for instance, than in the P–O
bonds of 12 ATP molecules). While the traditional view has been that
the energy is stored in glucose or NADH + H+, we will show
in the following that glucose and NADH are, at best, moderate-energy
species, and “fully reduced” hydrocarbons are low-energy
molecules in the absence of O2. Instead, O2 provides
≥3/4 of the energy released12 in
respiration and the “electron transfer chain”.

High-Energy
Molecules
Chemical reactions releasing
energy typically involve multiple reactants. In examples such as the
reactions in eqs 1, 5, and 6, it may not be clear
a priori which of the reactants provides the energy. In addition,
the relative energy of the products also plays an important role.
Nevertheless, a molecule or chemical species can be considered to
have high energy if it releases hundreds of kilojoules per mole of
bonds broken and reformed in reactions with a wide range of other
reactants and generating various products.

High-energy molecules
have relatively weak bonds; when these are broken and converted to
stronger bonds in the products, energy is released. It must be noted
that such an energy analysis in terms of weak bonds converting to
stronger bonds can be generalized easily only if the number of bonds
remains unchanged (see examples in the Supporting Information). This applies only to electron-pair bonds.12 Therefore, when speaking about weak bonds and
strong bonds in the context of chemical energy, we should count a
double bond as two bonds.12

O2 Is a High-Energy Molecule
The reaction
of O2 with an organic molecule can be written as 7  

This represents thousands
of different strongly exothermic reactions. A generalized bond energy
analysis has shown that ΔcHo = νO2 (−418 ± 12
kJ/mol) is released,12 in other words,
that the heat of combustion is proportional to the amount of O2 used up. The proportionality of ΔcHo with νO2 was discovered
empirically several times,17,18 including in the context
of biochemistry.19 The energy can be attributed
to the relatively weak double bond of O2, which is 300
kJ/mol higher than that of a double bond in CO2, about
400 kJ/mol higher than the two bonds in H2O, and 200–350
kJ/mol higher than pairs of single bonds of C in organic fuels.12,20,21 The bonding in O2,
with a σ-bond even weaker than in H2O2 or F2 and a complicated but significantly bonding π-electron
system,22 is reviewed in the Supporting Information. A bond energy analysis
demonstrating that O2 is a high-energy molecule irrespective
of its bond order can be found in the Supporting Information.

The entropic contribution to the free energy
of combustion at T = 298 K derived in the Supporting Information is usually a fairly small correction to ΔcHo = −418 kJ/mol (c + 0.3h – 0.5o).12 Overall, we obtain 8  If the standard molar entropy
of the fuel is not known, then Sofuel = 200 J/(mol K) is often a sufficiently good approximation
for fairly small molecules. For glucose, the equation predicts the
free energy of combustion with better than 3% accuracy. The energetics
of combustion are visualized in Figure 1a, which shows the average free energy of a double
bond or two single bonds in molecules relevant in respiration. The
special role of O2 as a high-energy molecule is similarly
apparent here as in the analogous plot of bond-formation enthalpies.12

Figure 1 Free energy of a mole of double bonds or 2 mol of single
bonds
in various molecules involved in important biochemical processes.
The more stable a bonded species is, the lower it appears in the diagram.
(a) Free energy diagram for combustion or respiration. For glucose
and ethanol, the graph shows the average free energies of 2 mol of
bonds, that is, 1/12 and 1/8, respectively, of the total bonding free
energy listed in Table S1. Similar values
are found for 2 mol of bonds in methanol (−756 kJ) and in acetic
acid (−754 kJ); see the Supporting Information. (b) Visualization of the nearly unchanged energetics in the Calvin
cycle and in glycolysis plus the Krebs cycle in terms of the average
free energy of 2 mol of electron pair bonds. “H2”NAD(P)H represents the energy of NAD(P)H + H+ relative to NAD(P)+, which can be considered a
H2 analogue (see the Supporting Information for details). Pyruv., pyruvic acid; Glyceral. 3-phos., glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate. All species with labile protons are assumed to be fully
protonated for simplicity.

In addition to reactions in eqs 4a–4e and 7, other instructive reactions of O2 include 9a   9b   9c   9d   9e   9f   9g   9h   9i   9j  

These examples, all balanced
with ∼6 O2 to match
the combustion of glucose in eq 1, show that reactions with O2 release a lot of
energy, regardless of whether or not the products contain CO2 or H2O. This qualifies O2 as a high-energy
molecule, consistent with Figure 1a.

Glucose Has Only Moderate Energy
Unlike O2, glucose does not release a lot of energy (per
mass or per bond)
in many of its reactions. Examples of this, including alcoholic and
lactic acid fermentation, are shown in eqs 2a–2f, 3a, and 3b. Here, we add several
more: 10a   10b   10c   10d   10e   10f   10g  (for the data needed to
calculate ΔrGo in eqs 10a and 10c, see ref (25)).

The data show that reactions of glucose without O2 release only a fraction of the free energy given off in the glucose
combustion reaction in eq 1. This is can be understood in terms of average bond free energies
(see Figure 1), which
are much lower for glucose than for O2 but slightly higher
than for some of the other molecules involved in the reactions. It
should also be noted that ΔrGo contains up to −650 kJ/mol not from bond energies
but from −TΔrSo: there is an entropy increase due to the breakup of
a larger molecule such as glucose into several small ones (with typical
molar entropies of 70 to 215 J/(mol K), corresponding to −21
to −64 kJ/mol in ΔrGo at 298 K).

The fact that glucose is not a high-energy
molecule is highlighted
by the fairly minor energy release upon its conversion into smaller
molecules (see eqs 2a–2f and 10a–10d), including some producing CO2 with
its strong, 804 kJ/mol bonds. When the bonds of glucose are broken,
the energy stored in these bonds should be released; less than 30
kJ per mole of bonds is observed, while O2 gives off 300
kJ/mol when its double bond is converted to a double bond in CO2.12

Reduced Molecules Have
Little Energy
Hydrocarbons are
excellent fuels in combustion because they react with many O2 molecules and unlock their energy.12 Their
large energy of combustion per mass has resulted in the lore1,2,5 that these “highly reduced
molecules” are energy-rich. However, the “most reduced
molecule”, CH4, does not release energy when it
breaks up or reacts 11a   11b   11c   11d   11e   11f   11g  except when reacting with
O2 or other oxidants with weak bonds. This is consistent
with the low energy of CH4 due to strong bonding (see Figure 1a). Indeed, certain
anaerobic microbes, the methanogens, power themselves by running the
reaction in eq 3c in
reverse, which takes advantage of the low energy of methane and water
as products.26 The n-alkanes
and fatty acids show similarly little energy release except when reacting
with O2 (see the Supporting Information). This disproves the claim that reduced molecules contain a lot
of energy.

NAD(P)H Is Not a High-Energy Molecule
Based on the
standard presentation of bioenergetics,3,6 it is easy
to conclude that “the bulk of the required energy comes from
NADPH”27 or that “NADPH is
an energy-carrying molecule produced in the first stage of photosynthesis.
It provides energy to fuel the Calvin cycle in the second stage of
photosynthesis”.28 One can show
that this is erroneous by analyzing the energetics of reactions of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) or NAD(P)H with various
molecules or species (other than O2) available in the biosphere: 12a   12b   12c   12d   12e   12f  

For ease of comparison
with aerobic respiration (eq 6), most reactions have been considered for 12NAD(P)H. The
data show that reactions of NAD(P)H without O2 are sometimes
endergonic and release at most one-seventh of the energy of the reaction
in eq 6 with O2. This demonstrates that NAD(P)H does not qualify as a high-energy
molecule.

In the analysis of the chemical energy of the fairly
complex-looking
reactions in eqs 12a–12f, a simplifying approximation proved
useful (ref (1), p
661): NAD(P)H + H+ undergoes the same reactions as H2 (see the Supporting Information for examples); when analyzing the energetics, one can consider NAD(P)
as “H”, a hypothetical species whose bond energy to
H and ionization energy in water are similar to the corresponding
energies of H. Thus, within a biochemical reaction, one can replace 13a  with 13b  and even shorter 13c  where we
treat “H2”NAD(P)H as a hypothetical
form of H2 with ΔfGo′“H2”(NAD(P)H) = −17
kJ/mol or ΔfGo″“H2”(NAD(P)H) = +61 kJ/mol (which is at −21
kJ/mol relative to H2(g)).13,14 In this context,
it is relevant to note
that the bond in H2 is relatively strong, 436 kJ/mol, similar
to C–H (410 kJ/mol) and stronger than C–C or C–O
(350 kJ/mol) bonds, so H2 is not a high-energy molecule
(see also Figure 1a).

Representing the Energetics of Redox Reactions in Respiration
Two
Valid Views of Energy Release in a Redox Reaction
Two complementary
views of the energetics of redox reactions can
be found explicitly or implicitly in biochemistry textbooks;1,6 both enable calculation of the standard free energy change ΔrGo from tabulated, measured thermodynamic
quantities, but it is important not to confuse them conceptually.
We demonstrate the concepts and calculations for the example of 14  where Fe2+(cytc) stands for a ferrous
ion in cytochrome c. This is the most important reaction
in aerobic respiration, releasing
the most energy in a single step (ΔrGo′ = −1308 kJ/mol with 6O2, nearly
half of the total of the reaction in eq 1). While this has traditionally been described as the
terminal step of aerobic respiration, it can be argued that it should
be regarded as the first step (see the Supporting Information).

High-Energy Reactants to Lower-Energy Products
From
the free energies of products, Go′prod, and reactants, Go′reactants, pure in their standard states and weighted with
the stoichiometric coefficients νi, ΔrGo′ can be
calculated simply as the difference 15  Thus, in a graph of Go′prod and Go′reactants, ΔrGo′ is the
“gap” between
the “free energy levels” (see Figure 2a and Figure S1). This visualizes that the chemical energy released in a reaction
has been stored in relatively high-energy reactants and is released
when lower-energy products are formed.

Figure 2 Three different representations
of the free energy ΔrGo′ released in a redox reaction.
The chosen example with ΔrGo′ = −218 kJ/mol is the initial reaction in eq 14 in the energy transfer
chain of aerobic respiration. Here, Fe2+ and Fe3+ are meant to be incorporated into cytochrome c,
and H+ is in aqueous solution. (a) Reactant and product
energy levels. The label “O2 + 4H+ +
4Fe2+” means GoO2 + 4Go′H+(aq) + 4GoFe2+(cytc). (b) Half-reaction “energy
levels” (“standard reduction potentials”) as
widely used in biochemistry. The numerical values of the two levels
on the absolute scale (Go relative to
the free atoms) are −1748 and −1968 kJ/mol at pH 7 (see
also Figure S1). The figure highlights
that the higher the energy GoO2 of O2, the lower the associated half-reaction
energy level. Note that the vertical axis shows an energy difference
rather than absolute free energy and that one cannot draw an arrow
pointing from reactants to products. (c) Redox energy transfer and
release diagram showing the free energies of reactants and products
in the half-reactions, with the low-energy species in the half-reactions
aligned. The curved arrows point from specific reactants to products.
Dashed lines indicate that the vertical range of the curved arrows
(−1968 and +1749 kJ/mol) has been shortened for easier graphing.

In the Supporting Information, it is
shown how eq 15 can
be evaluated either through the traditional thermochemistry approach
with difficult-to-interpret free energies of formation or more meaningfully
using the individual free energy Goi of species i relative to the
free atoms, that is, based on bond energies. Because only the latter
analysis has explanatory power, it is the one we adopt in this paper.
It fits with the initial correct notion in some biochemistry textbooks
that chemical energy is associated with chemical bonding. Table S1 lists meaningful individual free energies Gio of various molecules and ions relevant in
this paper.

The traditional analysis sets the free energies
of certain important
species, such as O2 and H2, to zero, thus convolving
their bond energies into the free energies of formation of all their
products. For instance, ΔfGoH2O = GoH2O – GoH2 – 1/2GoO2, where the energy of O2 relative
to the free atoms, GoO2 = −464 kJ/mol, is dominated by the bond formation enthalpy
of −498 kJ/mol of molecular oxygen. Therefore, while GoH2O reflects only the
enthalpy and entropy of H2O itself, ΔfGoH2O depends also
on the bond strengths of H2 and O2 and is thus
not suitable for explaining which molecule stores chemical energy.
While both approaches produce correct numerical results, the traditional
approach has no explanatory power.

Half-Reaction Analysis
A redox reaction can be viewed
as the sum of two suitably balanced half-reactions. For the sample
reaction in eq 14, they
are 16a   16b   16c   16d  

The chemical species
on the left-hand side of eqs 16a and 16c can be viewed as electron acceptors
and those on the right as electron donors. The free energy ΔhrGo′i of half-reaction i can be obtained in
the usual way (i.e., as ΣjνjGo′prod,j – ΣjνjGo′reactants,j), except that the electrons are ignored (which is
without consequence since they are only intermediates in the overall
reaction). The relation to the standard reduction potential Eo′i of the
half-reaction is 17  where νe is the stoichiometric coefficient of the electrons (νe = 4 in our example). The constant in the last term is c = −413 kJ/mol for conventional Eo′i values and c = 0 for “absolute reduction potentials on the vacuum
scale”.29 Based on eq 17, it is common in biochemistry
to refer to Eo′i (in volts) instead of ΔredGo′i (in kJ/mol) (see
also the Supporting Information).

Since the half-reactions add to give the overall reaction, their
free energies add to give the overall free energy of reaction 18a   18b   18c  where eq 18c reproduces eq 15. According to eq 18b, the free energy of
reaction can be obtained
as the difference in the energies of the half-reactions (when both
are written as reductions). In a graph of half-reaction free energies
ΔredGo′i = −νeFEoi + νec, the “gap” between the “reduction
potential free energy levels” is ΔrGo′ (see Figure 2b and Figure S2).6

Note that Figure 2b is fundamentally different from Figure 2a: the upper level
in Figure 2b is not
the total reactant free energy but
a difference between reactant and product free energies, and the lower
level is not the total product energy but a difference between product
and reactant energies. Consequently, an arrow from the higher to the
lower level would not point from reactants to products.

A Superior
Representation of Half-Reaction Energetics: Redox
Energy Transfer and Release Diagrams
The two types of “energy-level”
diagrams described here and exemplified in Figure 2a,b can be useful for some purposes, and
indeed, one finds various examples of half-reaction energy representations
(ii) in biochemistry textbooks.1,6 However, both presentations
have significant limitations. In view (i), the energetics of different
reactants (O2, 4H+(aq), and 4Fe2+(cytc) in our example) are lumped together, and
therefore, stored chemical energy is not easily attributed. In addition,
half-reactions are not distinguished, even though they are often spatially
separated from each other. Furthermore, for a series of reactions,
it is very cumbersome that the “by-stander” reactants
of future reactions or products of previous reactions need to be included
(see Figure S1). The half-reaction view
(ii) needs to be used with great caution; it does not show clearly
where chemical energy is stored since each energy level is a difference
between reactant and product energies.

To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a presentation that shows not only separate half-reactions
but also the energetics of different reactants (relative to their
corresponding products), giving a better indication of where chemical
energy is stored. It is demonstrated in Figure 2c for our sample reaction in eq 14. The tips of the curved arrows
indicate the spontaneous directions of the coupled half-reactions.
The vertical reach of each curved arrow is the free energy difference
ΔredGio′ of the half-reaction.
According to eq 18b, the difference of these differences is ΔrGo, as shown in the figure. The diagram shows
“redox energy transfer (from O2 + 4H+ to Fe2+) and release (ΔrGo′)” (RETAR).

The only adjustable
parameter in the RETAR diagram is the relative
vertical shift of the left half-reaction versus the right half-reaction.
This is discussed in more detail in the Supporting Information and Figure S3. To make
it possible to read off ΔrGo directly, aligning the lowest-free energy species, as shown
in Figure 2c, or the
highest, as shown in Figure S3b, is advisable.
Electron transfer can also be shown explicitly in the diagram (see Figure S3b).

Unlike the two energy level
diagrams in Figure 2a,b, the redox energy transfer and release
diagram of Figure 2c shows very clearly that the high-energy reactants storing chemical
energy are O2 + 4H+. Since Fe2+(cytc) is lower in energy than Fe3+(cytc) (ripping an electron off a cation is always energetically uphill),
Fe2+(cytc) cannot be regarded as a high-energy
species. Also, the diagram makes clear that some energy is transferred
from O2 + 4H+ to be stored in Fe3+(cytc). This energy is released in the next step
in the energy transfer chain as Fe3+(cytc) is reduced back to Fe2+(cytc) (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Schematic redox energy
transfer and release diagram of aerobic
respiration (equivalent to the traditional electron transfer chain,
with the reactions in eqs 14, 25, and 26).
The inner mitochondrial membrane (in yellow) and three protein complexes
(in gray and brown) are shown schematically. Complex II, with an alternative
reaction of coenzyme Q, has been omitted for clarity. The solid curved
black arrows show energy transfer and release in pairs of redox half-reactions;
here, a vertical free energy axis is implicit. The number of protons
pumped (slanted dashed green arrows) should be proportional to the
energy released (energy difference between the left and right solid
curved arrows). Small blue arrows indicate electrons transferred.
Energy-carrying oxidized species are highlighted in red and boldface.
Motions of energy-carrying species are indicated by bold red dashed
curved lines with arrowheads, while motions of their electron-carrying
reduced counterparts are shown by thin dashed arrows.

Correcting Common Electron Transfer Misconceptions
In the following, we discuss common misconceptions about electron
transfer. Note that the section headlines are true statements rather
than the corresponding misconceptions.

The Higher the Energy of
O2, the Lower Its Half-Reaction
Free Energy Level
The half-reaction energy level of the half-reaction
with O2 is low (see Figure 2b); it is in fact the lowest in the entire electron
transfer chain of respiration (Figure S2a).6 This can easily lead to the misconception
that O2 is a low-energy species.1,3,6

To avoid this mistake, one needs to
realize that half-reaction levels are not actual energy levels of
chemical species. Unlike the free energy levels in Figure 2a, half-reaction levels do
not reflect a free energy or sum of free energies but rather a difference
in free energies. Specifically, the energy level for the half-reaction
in eq 16a/eq 16b with O2 is 19  Due to the minus sign in
front of GoO2, the
higher the free energy of O2 (weaker bonding), the lower
its half-reaction energy level.

For the same reason, the energy
level ΔredGoF2/2F– = 2GoF– – GoF2 of
the half-reaction F2 + 2e– → 2F– is extremely low (see Figure S2b). F2 is undoubtedly a high-energy molecule with a weak
bond (the bond formation enthalpy is only −155 kJ/mol), which
results in a bond free energy of −248 kJ for 2 mol of F–F
bonds, higher (less negative) than for any of the molecules in Figure 1. This simple example
confirms convincingly that weaker bonding, or higher energy, of the
electron acceptor lowers the half-reaction energy level.

It
is true that an oxidation half-reaction is less unfavorable
energetically the lower the energy of the reduced reactant’s
own conjugate electron acceptor (Fe3+(cytc) for the reactant Fe2+(cytc) in the
half-reaction in eq 16c and overall reaction in eq 14). However, that acceptor is not initially present; it is
only generated by the reaction, and electrons are not transferred
to this acceptor. The actual acceptor among the reactants is always
the acceptor of the other half-reaction, which is O2 +
4H+ in our example (eq 14). Since that acceptor is a reactant, the higher its
energy, the more energy is released by the overall reaction.

Hydrogen,
Rather than Oxygen, Is the Main Terminal Electron
Acceptor
It is commonly claimed that O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– → 2H2O(l) is driven by “electron transfer to oxygen”.1,3,6 This description is not tenable.
Rather, this half-reaction mostly involves electron transfer to hydrogen,
similarly as in the related half-reaction 20  where, undoubtedly,
the electrons
are transferred to hydrogen. Each H in H2O has an effective
atomic charge of +0.33e,30 which means
that 67% of an electron charge compensates the proton charge (+1e
– 0.67e = +0.33e) and is thus associated with hydrogen. Only
33% of the two electrons is transferred to oxygen. The charge distribution
is shown schematically in Figure S4. In
other words, significantly more of the electrons are transferred to
hydrogen than to oxygen.

The same is true for other molecules
considered as electron acceptors. In the reaction of coenzyme Q 21  the electrons are
primarily
accepted not by Q but by H+ since, for each of the two
O–H bonds formed, the majority of one electron in the covalent
bond will become associated with H. While the electrons are not primarily
transferred to Q, it would be correct to say that the electrons are
(completely) transferred into QH2.

The notion of
“electron transfer to oxygen” is a
misguided attempt based on a mistaken 1920 postulate of “liberation
of energy in the interdisplacement ... of electrons between atoms
or molecules”31,32 to explain why the half-reaction
in eq 16a with O2 (ΔredGo = −2128
kJ/mol, ΔredGo′
= −1968 kJ/mol) is more energetically favorable than the reaction
in eq 20 without O2. In reality, the difference of −476 kJ/mol between
the two half-reactions is mostly due to the high energy of the weak
double bond in O212,20 relative to two bonds
in H2O (by −429 kJ/mol).

An Electron Waterfall?
A common representation of the
electron transport chain in aerobic respiration is as an “electron
waterfall”.6,24 Here, electrons are thought to
move from a high-energy donor through other species (acceptors? donors?)
to a low-energy terminal acceptor, O2. This picture, a
flawed interpretation of Figure 2b or Figure S2a, is wrong
in many respects. To see how, we consider again the example of O2 + 4H+(aq) + 4Fe2+(cytc) → 2H2O + 4Fe3+(cytc). Since some of the errors have already been discussed, the analysis
can be brief.

First, the electrons are not transferred to O2 but are mostly accepted by 4H+ and end up in 2H2O. Second, the simplistic electron energy “waterfall”
picture6,24 incorrectly proposes that the electron donor
Fe2+(cytc) is a high-energy species responsible
for the electron flow. However, donation of electrons by Fe2+ is actually energetically uphill since it requires ionization; this
is correctly shown in the RETAR diagram (Figure 2c). Third, it is an indisputable fact (eq 19) that the “drop
in the waterfall”, ΔrGo′, is greater in magnitude if the electron acceptors
O2 + 4H+ are not of low but of high energy (weak
bonding).

Even if the incorrect notion about electron transfer
to a low-energy
acceptor is given up, the electron waterfall picture is still easily
misinterpreted. It is enticing to view it as a diagram of the free
energy per electron, that is, the electron electrochemical potential,
in half-cells associated with the standard reduction potentials. However,
this is highly problematic, being equivalent to the difficult problem
of determining the real (not “vacuum”) half-cell or
single-electrode potential.29 The electrochemical
potential of an electron generated in a half-reaction depends on the
“medium” (metal electrode or intermediate acceptor molecule)
in which the electron is deposited; for a metal electrode, the relevant
energy would be the work function or the true Fermi energy.29 A simple example where electrons in electrodes
with different standard reduction potentials have the same free energy
is presented in Figure S5.

In the
end, the use of standard reduction potentials is just a
device to summarize and visualize the crucial free energy change ΔrGo in redox reactions as a simple
difference according to eq 18b. When fundamental insight is to be conferred, a standard
reduction potential diagram as in Figure 2b or Figure S2 is inferior to the RETAR diagram introduced in Figure 2c, which provides much more
information about the energetics of the species involved in the half-reactions.

The Reduced “Electron-Carrying” Species Do Not
Carry the Energy
In the standard description of biochemical
energetics, electron flow is implicitly presented as a stand-in for
energy flow.1−3,6 Here, we show that the
electron-carrying species in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain
do not carry the energy; rather, their oxidized counterparts do.

Fe2+ in cytochrome c carries an electron
from complex III in the inner mitochondrial membrane to complex IV,
where it gives off the electron (into H2O) forming Fe3+(cytc). Fe2+ is lower in energy
than the more ionized Fe3+, so it is Fe3+(cytc) that carries energy from complex IV to complex III, where
Fe3+(cytc) is the high-energy species
in the next redox reaction (see Figure 3). In the Supporting Information, the corresponding analysis is presented for ubiquinone (coenzyme
Q) carrying energy and its fully reduced counterpart, QH2, carrying electrons between complex III and complexes I or II in
the mitochondrial membrane.

Electrons transfer energy only if
they move relative to the associated
positive ions. So, while electrons moving through a wire produce an
electric current carrying energy, electrons moving with a wire through
a field-free space do not (their kinetic energy is negligible due
to their small mass compared to the nuclei). Similarly, the “extra”
electrons in diffusing neutral QH2 do not give rise to
an electric current and do not carry energy; due to its stabilization
by an additional bond, QH2 can actually be considered as
being lower in energy than Q.

Electron Transfer and Energy
Release
Electron Transfer and Bond Energies
Electron transfer,
usually associated with standard reduction potentials Eo′, has been greatly emphasized in the traditional
description of the “terminal” processes of respiration
and of the primary light reaction of photosynthesis. However, closer
inspection shows that electron transfer is a description, not an explanation,
since its “driving force” is just empirical Eo′ values or nebulous “affinities
for electrons”1 that are not quantified
in terms of atomic or molecular properties. The reduction potentials
are simply taken as given properties of molecules or ions, while they,
in fact, derive from bond, ionization, and hydration energies of conjugate
oxidized and reduced species, as we have shown for galvanic cells
and batteries.33

The electron transfer
picture may be appropriate for a few simple half-reactions involving
only a change in the charge of a hydrated ion (e.g., from Fe3+ to Fe2+). However, if the chemical bonding changes, for
example, in O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– → 2H2O(l), the difference in
bond energies of reactants and products often makes the dominant contribution
to the energetics and drives the electron flow.

The easily misunderstood
phrase that “electron transfer
drives”16 redox processes should
be avoided. The electrons do not drive the underlying exergonic redox
reaction but, on the contrary, are driven by the free energy difference
between reactants and products. As an example, consider a fuel cell,
where the electron flow is a secondary effect of a redox reaction,
not its driving force. Nevertheless, just like a running fuel cell
that can charge a battery, the electron flow in respiration can drive
other endergonic redox processes, which eventually leads to ATP production.

Local but Not Global Electron Flow
The purpose of electron
transfer at a membrane is to control reactions with very negative
ΔrG, minimizing release of the energy
as heat. This is achieved by reactants remaining separated by the
membrane, which is analogous to the separation of half-cells in fuel
cells or many galvanic cells. For instance, if the Cu2+(aq) ions in a Daniell cell were allowed to react directly with the
Zn(s) electrode, then no electrical work but just heat would be produced
as Zn2+(aq) and Cu(s) are formed.

In biochemistry
textbooks, electron transfer is often represented in cartoons suggesting
long-range electron flow, for instance, to NADH in glycolysis and
the citric acid cycle.1,3,6 In
reality, electrons flow only over a few nanometers in most biochemical
processes; the diffusion of neutral reduced molecules does not produce
an energetically relevant electron flow, as pointed out above. Instead,
chemical energy is transported in weak bonds, in ions, or in potential
bonds yet to be formed and is often higher in molecules or ions with
fewer electrons. The purpose of what has been called “electron
transfer” is often arguably hydrogen transfer, for example,
from glucose to NADH in glycolysis or from NADPH to CO2 in photosynthesis of biomolecules.

The Electron Transfer Chain
in Aerobic Respiration
In the following, we analyze the well-studied
and relatively simple
terminal steps of aerobic respiration, which for historical reasons
is referred to as “oxidative phosphorylation”.1−3,6Figure 3 shows a schematic of the electron transfer
processes at the inner mitochondrial membrane, with a level of detail
similar as in introductory biochemistry textbooks.1−3,6 The electron transfer can be summarized as 22  

This simple version
of the chain includes only species that carry the electrons; why O2 does not show up is discussed in the Supporting Information. (In addition, it has already been
pointed out above that electrons are transferred into H2O but not primarily to oxygen.) The corresponding energy transfer
chain listing the high-energy oxidized species is 23  (with twice larger stoichiometric
coefficients than in eq 22). Note that the main purpose of the chain is not so much transfer
of electrons or energy to the next species in the chain but rather
controlled release of energy in the process (“during the arrows”).

Energetics of the Aerobic Respiration Chain
The natural
starting point for analyzing the flow of chemical energy in aerobic
respiration (see Figure 3) is the reaction involving O2, eq 14, which releases ΔrGo′ = −218 kJ/mol at pH 7 for νO2 = 1, converting 4Fe2+(cytc) to 4Fe3+(cytc). The released chemical
energy can be attributed mostly to molecular O2, specifically
its relatively weak double bond. This attribution is confirmed when
we compare the reaction in eq 14 with the (hypothetical) analogous reaction without oxygen 24  In this case,
the reaction
is not even exergonic and will not occur spontaneously. The difference
in the free energies of the two reactions is close to the −418
kJ for 1 mol of O2 in combustion.12

While in the reaction in eq 14 about half of the energy of O2 is given
off to eventually generate ATP, the other half is used to generate
Fe3+(cytc), a high-energy electron acceptor
that drives the energetics of the next reaction in the chain, in complex
III 25  (for ΔrGo′ in eq 25, see ref (16)).

This generates the moderately-high-energy coenzyme Q, which,
in
complex I, drives 26  due to formation
of two fairly
strong O–H bonds and aromatic stabilization in QH2. (If the 4Fe3+(cytc) in the earlier
reactions in eqs 14 and 24 are to be matched, all stoichiometric coefficients
and ΔrGo′ values
should be doubled in eqs 25 and 26.) The redox energy transfer
and release diagram in Figure 3 with NADH near the bottom confirms our earlier conclusion
that calling NADH a high-energy molecule27,28 is not warranted. The energy released in the chain of reactions
in eqs 14, 25, and 26, equivalent to the
reaction in eq 6, to
eventually produce ATP can mostly be traced back to O2.

Reconsidering the Number of Protons Pumped by the Energy of
O2
According to the widely accepted chemiosmotic
theory,1−3,6 the free energy released
in the reactions of aerobic respiration is used to pump protons across
the inner mitochondrial membrane. Textbooks claim that dioxygen in
the reaction in eq 14, balanced with νO2 = 1 and ΔrGo′ = −218 kJ/mol,
pumps only 4 + 4/2 = 6 protons (ref (1), p 742) while 2Q + 4H+(aq) + 2NADH
(eq 26) with ΔrGo′ = −162 kJ/mol pumps
as many as 8 + 2/2 = 9 protons. (Here, we count protons as half if
they are removed on one side of the membrane but not transported across.)

Since the reaction of O2 releases 218/162 = 1.3 times
more energy than that of 2Q, it should pump 12 rather than 6 protons
if the reaction of 2Q pumps 9H+. The energy per mole of
protons pumped is ∼20 kJ/mol,16 so
more than 6 protons should be pumped by the free energy change of
−218 kJ/mol. It is unlikely that the magnitude of 218 kJ/mol
is an overestimate, given that eq 14 has a major contribution from the large bond energy
change from O2 to H2O, which is not subject
to variation due to biochemical conditions. In fact, Alberty’s
data14 give an even larger magnitude of
ΔrGo″ = −229
kJ/mol for the reaction in eq 14.

If only 6 protons were pumped by the O2 reaction, then
the corresponding free energy absorption would be less than 140 kJ/mol,
and the rest of the released 229 kJ/mol, >90 kJ/mol, would have
to
be wasted as heat or taken up by another endergonic process. While
this discrepancy exists simply based on the ΔrGo′ values, independently of our assignment
of the energy to specific molecules, recognizing O2 as
the main carrier of chemical energy makes it clear that the large
amount of energy released by the reaction of O2 is to be
expected and that the endergonic processes that it drives, proton
pumping or otherwise, have not been fully identified.

Glycolysis
and Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle
The discussion
so far has focused on energy release from O2 in a chain
of reactions in eqs 14, 25, and 26 with NADH
as the terminal reactant, producing NAD+. NADH is regenerated
by the reaction of NAD+ with the hydrogen atoms released
from glucose as it gets converted to CO2 in the course
of glycolysis, decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl plus CO2 and NADH, and the citric acid (or Krebs) cycle.1−3,6 The net reaction (without ADP) is shown in eq 10g, with ΔrGo′ = −341 kJ/mol and
ΔrGo″ = −307
kJ/mol, which results in phosphorylation of ∼4 ADP molecules
to ATP.1 For reference, respiration of
the same amount of glucose with oxygen releases nearly 9 times more
energy (see eq 1) and
can generate correspondingly more ATP. The net reaction in glycolysis
(without ∼2 ADP molecules) from glucose to pyruvate and NADH
is given by eq 3a, with
modest ΔrGo′ =
−147 kJ/mol16 and ΔrGo″ = −153 kJ/mol.
Then, by difference, the citric acid cycle (plus pyruvate decarboxylation)
accounts for meager ΔrGo′ = −194 kJ/mol and ΔrGo″ = −154 kJ/mol. This disproves a textbook
claim (ref (10), Table
18-1) that the citric acid cycle produces a large number of ATP molecules.

The Calvin Cycle
The Calvin cycle in the dark reaction
of photosynthesis converts three molecules of CO2 to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate, with hydrogen provided by NADPH and phosphate by ATP.1−3,6 As shown in the Supporting Information, the net reaction (leaving out 8ATP
+ 8H2O) can be written as 27  If organic molecules contained
a lot of chemical energy, their production from CO2 should
require much energy input, comparable to the 2875 kJ/mol of eq 1 run in reverse. In reality,
as eq 27 shows, only
∼280 kJ/mol is required (on a six-carbon basis). The bond energies
in Figure 1b visualize
this small energy change. When the 8ATP + 8H2O is included
in the overall Calvin cycle reaction, the cycle is exergonic (ΔrGo″ = −157 kJ/mol),
as required.

Synopsis
The Traditional Description
of Bioenergetics Is Incorrect
Some readers who have taught
the traditional version of bioenergetics
for many years may be inclined to declare that it is equivalent to
the new view introduced here. However, this is not consistent with
the evidence. The traditional explanation assuming high-energy fuels
and electron transfer to oxygen fails to provide a comprehensive,
consistent explanation of the experimental observations and therefore
needs to be abandoned. These shortcomings can be highlighted by analyzing,
as before, the “terminal electron transfer reaction”
(eq 14), O2 + 4H+(aq) + 4Fe2+(cytc) →
2H2O + 4Fe3+(cytc):(i) The traditional
explanation in terms
of electron transfer to oxygen is mechanistically incorrect: the electrons
are mostly transferred to hydrogen, not oxygen (see above).

(ii) The electron transfer
or fuel energy
description cannot explain why this reaction is highly exergonic and
exothermic: no organic fuel is involved in this reaction, yet a lot
of energy is produced (approximately –1350 kJ/mol per 6O2). Since Fe2+(cytc) is lower in
energy than Fe3+(cytc), organisms are
certainly not fueled by Fe2+(cytc) and,
thus, the energy released by the reaction in eq 14 unquestionably comes from O2,
a proven high-energy molecule.

(iii) Any explanation connecting electron
transfer between molecules with the energy released must include bond
energies. These are quantities with energy units and real explanatory
power unlike standard reduction potentials in volts. The energy stored
in O2 can be attributed quantitatively to its relatively
weak double bond,12 which is less stable
(higher in energy) by 250–410 kJ/mol relative to a double bond
in CO2 or a pair of single bonds in organic molecules or
in H2O (see Figure 1).

(iv) The standard
reduction potential
levels in the electron waterfall picture6,24 are not energies
of chemical species but differences between such energies. Therefore,
they do not reveal where chemical energy is stored. Specifically,
the level of the terminal half-reaction is lowered as the energy of
the electron acceptors, O2 + 4H+, is increased.
Both changes would increase the energy released with the electron:
the acceptors are reactants, and higher reactant energy increases
the energy released by a reaction.

(v) The traditional electron transfer
analysis has ignored the (model-independent) large negative ΔrGo′ value of this reaction
in eq 14, which was
just another meaningless empirical value, and therefore overlooked
that it is incompatible with the small number of protons supposedly
pumped by complex IV. Recognizing O2 as a high-energy molecule,
our analysis correctly predicts the large negative ΔrGo′ value and highlights the
factor-of-two discrepancy in the number of H+ pumped.



The basic traditional assumption that fuel
molecules
contain the energy released in respiration is not supported by the
facts. We have highlighted that all reactions of organic biomolecules
with O2 are highly exothermic and exergonic, even if no
CO2 or H2O is generated, confirming that O2 is properly considered a high-energy molecule. The high-energy
fuel molecule assumption fails to explain why the supposedly high-energy
fuel molecules do not show their energy in reactions without oxygen,
such as fermentation. Whether glucose fragments into ethanol and CO2 or completely rearranges its bonding when forming CO2 and CH4, according to eqs 2c and 2f, only −225
to −425 kJ/mol are released (of which approximately −200
kJ/mol is from entropy, not bond energies).

Ignoring these new
insights and continuing to promulgate the incorrect
traditional description of respiration would be akin to explaining
summer as arising from Earth being closer to the sun than in winter,
or day and night from the sun revolving around the Earth: the description
“makes intuitive sense” and would be a good explanation
if it was true, but closer inspection disproves it and a different
explanation quantitatively accounting for all observations has to
be accepted and taught.

Limitations of the Electron Transfer Paradigm
Electron
transfer has been presented as a stand-in for energy flow in biochemical
processes.1−3,6 This needs to be reassessed.
Electron flow in and of itself is of limited importance in cells compared
to energy flow and atom transfer. True electron transfer involving
electrons separated from atoms does not occur outside of specialized
filaments over distances of more than a few nanometers; its purpose
is controlled energy transfer minimizing the release of heat. Diffusion
of electrons bound in reduced molecules is not diffusion of energy
since the oxidized counterparts of these carriers are of higher energy.
Transfer of hydrogen atoms appears to be the main benefit of many
so-called electron transfer processes. Electron transfer has no true
explanatory power for energy flow since it does not reveal which weak
bonds initially stored the energy.

In standard biochemical pathways,
there is no relevant analogy to electron flow in a metal wire producing
a force on the wire in a magnetic field and, consequently, work in
a motor. The only applicable macroscopic analogy may be electrons
transferring chemical energy from one charging battery or fuel cell
to another being charged. Proton transfer, being the driving force
of ATP synthesis, seems equally relevant as electron transfer for
energy transduction since energy can be stored more easily in proton
concentration gradients than in distinct transferred electrons. As
an example of how existing textbook presentations can be reconciled
with these considerations, a revision of an introductory section on
energy and electron transfer from Lehninger’s biochemistry
text1 is proposed at the end of the Supporting Information.

Bond Energies as the Crucial
Unifying Concept of Bioenergetics
Bioenergetics should be
built on the quantifiable12,33 principle that chemical
energy is stored in relatively weak bonds
and intermolecular interactions or in a high degree of ionization.
The energy is released when stronger bonds form or ions are reduced.
The main effect, energy stored in relatively weak bonds, can unify
the description of bioenergetics from O2 through glucose
to ATP. The energy previously encrypted in standard reduction potentials
given in volts can now be visualized through redox energy transfer
and release diagrams. The resulting schematics can look like “typical
biochemistry” (see Figure 3). Local electron transfer is only needed to control
the transfer of chemical energy and avoid the release of heat. The
general notion of long-range electron flow should be replaced with
the concept of transfer of energy in relatively weak bonds of molecules
and its release when more stable products form, which also applies
to ATP and is therefore a valid overarching principle of bioenergetics
from glucose and O2 all the way to CO2 and H2O and back.

O2 as the Major High-Energy Molecule
in the Biosphere
We have highlighted here that molecular
oxygen is the key high-energy
molecule driving the energetics of aerobic organisms; in hindsight,
it may be surprising that this had not been obvious. The relatively
weak double bond of O212,22 (for details
on the bonding, see the Supporting Information) provides a simple molecular explanation for the fact that all reactions
of organic molecules with O2 release a lot of energy (250–480
kJ per mole of O2), which is four to eight times more on
a per-mass basis than most other reactions, including those involving
ATP. This explains the drastic difference between aerobic and anaerobic
respiration energetics, which had remained without explanation in
the traditional presentation. It makes it obvious, for instance, why,
without O2, the conversion of glucose and water to CO2 and NADH releases only little energy. Textbooks have presented
the 30 or 57 kJ/mol from ATP hydrolysis as noteworthy while giving
the much larger >400 kJ released per mole of O2 only
a
passing reference. This is no longer tenable. O2 plays
a simple central role in bioenergetics. It also appears in other cases
where organisms require a lot of energy, for instance, in the generation
of cold light.1

O2 as
the crucial high-energy molecule explains the well-known fact that
large complex multicellular life became possible only with a sufficiently
high concentration of O2 in the atmosphere. Accordingly,
humans can survive for a few weeks without food and a few days without
water but only a few minutes without dioxygen. Not only most animals
but also plants during the night and at their roots require the chemical
energy of O2 for survival. O2 in the atmosphere
can be considered as communal storage, by plants, of chemical energy
derived from solar photons. The different roles of photosystems I
and II in plants resulting from the high energy of O2 will
be explained in a future paper about the energetics of photosynthesis.

Conclusions
We have provided an intuitive and quantitative
description of biochemical
energetics based on chemical energy stored mostly in weak bonds, showing
that O2 with its relatively weak double bond is the molecule
with the highest energy per bond in biochemistry. The analysis properly
explains why O2 makes aerobic respiration highly exergonic.
This obvious fact has, quite surprisingly, not been explained in the
traditional presentation of biochemical energetics, which did not
recognize the high-energy role of O2 but instead assumed
that the chemical energy powering complex organisms is stored in the
bonds of glucose, NAD(P)H, or reduced molecules. Then, reactions breaking
down these fuel molecules should release the energy supposedly stored
in their bonds, but they actually give off little energy in the absence
of O2. Accordingly, the standard picture of energy-rich
fuel molecules cannot explain why fermentation or breakup of glucose
into small molecules produces only little ATP. The amounts of energy
released or taken up during the Krebs and Calvin cycles are similarly
unremarkable. Highly reduced molecules have even less chemical energy
than glucose; they only unlock the energy of more O2 than
O-containing molecules of similar mass do. Methanogens producing energy
by generating methane, a highly reduced molecule, as a low-energy
product directly refute the claim that reduced molecules in biological
organisms have a high energy content.

The energy stored and
released by O2 has been completely
obscured in the conventional description of respiration, which is
given in terms of electron transfer and standard reduction potentials,
which are energy differences indirectly and nonintuitively expressed
in volts and with a sign switch. O2 has been called the
low-energy “terminal electron acceptor” for spent electrons.
We have exposed the underlying misconception by showing that a higher
free energy of the electron acceptors (O2 + 4H+) lowers the half-reaction “free energy level” associated
with the standard reduction potential.

In the first step of
aerobic respiration, the energy of O2 is used partly to
help generate the H+ gradient subsequently
exploited in ATP synthesis and partly to generate a high-energy intermediate,
Fe3+ in cytochrome c. This can be represented
convincingly in a redox energy transfer and release diagram. The analysis
highlights that the free energy released by the reaction of O2 must pump a larger number of protons than conventionally
claimed or be coupled to another endergonic process. Since this reaction
of O2 does not involve an organic molecule, it confirms
that organic fuel is not the origin of the energy released. The cascade
of subsequent reactions further utilizes the energy originally stored
in O2 to produce ATP. It has been described as an electron
transfer chain, but arguably, not the electron-carrying reduced molecules
or ions but their oxidized counterparts carry the energy. Electron
transfer is useful for controlled local energy release, but its relation
to long-range energy transport in neutral molecules is tenuous; a
bond energy analysis is more meaningful. To present bioenergetics
correctly, biochemistry textbooks will need to be revised significantly.
