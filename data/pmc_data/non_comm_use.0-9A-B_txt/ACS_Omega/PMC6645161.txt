1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide
(EDC) is a commonly
used reagent for bioconjugation and peptide synthesis. Both EDC and
the corresponding urea derivative, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylurea
(EDU), are achiral. As the reagent is active in aqueous solutions,
it is a common choice for the study of evolving secondary structural
changes via circular dichroism. This work highlights the effect of
EDU on spectropolarimetric measurements, namely, the problematic absorption
profile at low wavelengths (190–220 nm). We demonstrate that
EDU is capable of erroneously indicating structural changes, particularly
loss of α-helical character, through masking of the characteristic
minimum at 208 nm. However, if the concentrations of the EDU in the
sample are known, then this effect can be anticipated and calculations
of secondary structure can be adjusted to avoid the impacted wavelengths.
Impacts of EDU in a sample are compared to those of standard urea,
which, by contrast, is commonly used as a denaturant in circular dichroism
studies without issue.

==== Body
Introduction
This
work highlights the influence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylurea
(EDU) in circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The importance of this
work stems from the ubiquity of the carbodiimide coupling agent, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide
(EDC) in bioconjugation.1−5 The presence of EDU in CD samples can cause the underlying data
to be obscured, preventing the interpretation of structure for protein
and peptide bioconjugates. A key advantage of EDC bioconjugation is
its compatibility with aqueous solutions, making its conjugation chemistry
an attractive choice for study of evolving secondary structural changes
using circular dichroism.6,7 For example, recent
work has demonstrated a desire to study the self-assemblies of small
(three amino acid) peptide sequences computationally and experimentally.8 With an understanding of the influence of the
linking reagents on these measurements, these self-assemblies have
the potential to be measured as they are grown.

EDC is used
as a linking reagent for condensation reactions linking
amines to carboxylic acid groups, typically in aqueous media. The
EDU product of this reaction is the urea form of the original carbodiimide
molecule, as shown in Figure 1. Because of the molecule’s ability to react with both
water and the molecule of interest, EDC usage protocols generally
recommend a 10:1 molar ratio of EDC to each carboxylic acid, yielding
these same elevated concentrations of EDU in solution post-reaction.9

Figure 1 Reaction of EDC to EDU, either through use as a linking
reagent,
or via direct reaction with the aqueous solution.

Both EDC and EDU are achiral, and they might be assumed not
to
directly impact CD measurement. Unlike urea, however, EDU’s
applicable concentration range, absorption impact, and wavelength
range of interference on circular dichroism measurements are not commonly
known. Establishing those parameters will allow for the development
of well-controlled studies with clearly understood results using this
reagent in solution. Typically, the issues explored in this work are
eliminated in advance of structural studies by chromatography purification
of samples post-conjugation. Although that method is undeniably effective,
it is incompatible with kinetic studies or attempts to directly measure
the change in the secondary structure as a function of reaction completion
in real time.

We characterize the effect of EDU in a solution
by direct inspection
of CD signals of the common reference samples bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and pantolactone measured in increasing concentrations of both
urea and EDU. By evaluating the two-component system, we quantify
the degree that standard urea can be used without issue, whereas the
EDU can be problematic over similar concentration ranges. Because
circular dichroism measures the difference in absorbance of left-
and right-polarized light,10−13 any components in a solution able to change this
ratio will give rise to changes in the spectra obtained. In this work,
we highlight the degree that EDU absorbs over a much broader range
of wavelengths as well as the impact that this adsorption has on secondary
structure interpretation. Because only chiral molecules or molecules
with certain fixed orientations give rise to such a difference, small,
achiral molecules do not generally impact circular dichroism measurements.
However, if an achiral species is present in a sample that significantly
absorbs unpolarized light at the wavelength of the CD scan, it will
absorb a greater fraction of the transmitted light, simply due to
the greater availability of the light less absorbed by the chiral
molecule. This absorption results in a reduction in the magnitude
of the reported circular dichroism measurements because of the disproportionate
absolute absorption.

Results and Discussion
To quantify
the nature of EDU’s effect on a system, a series
of circular dichroism spectra are obtained on bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in deionized (DI) water (Figure 2). With no EDU present, the protein shows a clear α-helical
character. But at EDU concentrations as low as 0.05 M, the characteristic
minimum expected near 208 nm is completely obscured. As EDU, being
achiral, has a zero-magnitude CD signal of its own (Supporting Information), this effect cannot be thought of
as the summation of the CD spectra of the two molecules. At 0.1 M
EDU, the minimum at 222 has shifted to a higher wavelength and noticeably
decreased in intensity. This shift continues with increasing concentration
until a sample concentration of 0.4 M EDU, at which point it is no
longer possible to observe the helical signal associated with BSA.
Note that the signal decays to zero with increasing EDU concentration.
As we see signal loss, rather than signal transition to a random coil
configuration, we establish that the effect is due to EDU’s
impact on the CD signal, as opposed to EDU denaturing the secondary
structure of the protein molecules.

Figure 2 CD spectra of BSA at various concentrations
of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylurea.

To better understand the magnitude of this phenomenon, we
perform
the same experiment using urea (Figure 3). A small loss is seen around the 210 nm wavelength,
but the signal persists. Urea is a known denaturant, and the purpose
of Figure 3 is to highlight
the relative intensity of the data in Figure 2. Given that denaturation is potentially
a factor in the EDU results, we performed a second experiment in which
the signal loss could be decoupled from secondary structure changes.

Figure 3 CD spectra
of BSA at various concentrations of urea.

We duplicated the CD experiments with (S)-(+)-pantolactone
replacing the BSA (Figure 4). (S)-(+)-Pantolactone is a chiral molecule
incapable of secondary structure-based signal loss,14 and it is often used as a circular dichroism standard with
a known minimum at 219 nm. Neither urea nor EDU will have a structural
effect on this molecule, and their effects on absorbance and CD signal
can be decoupled from losses in the secondary structure.

Figure 4 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylurea
interferes with pantolactone
circular dichroism spectra as a function of EDU concentration. Inset:
CD spectra of pantolactone at various concentrations of urea.

When combining (S)-(+)-pantolactone with EDU (Figure 4), a clear trend
of complete data obfuscation is seen, analogous to that seen in Figure 2. From this, we conclude
that EDU’s absorbance gives rise to these results, as opposed
to structural changes arising from the EDU acting as a denaturant.

The two-component system with pantolactone and urea corroborates
the hypothesis (Figure 4, inset). At 0.4 M urea, only minor changes in the data are seen,
reinforcing the notion that urea does not interfere with circular
dichroism measurements at these wavelengths and concentrations. The
effects of urea are seen in the wavelengths below 200 nm, which is
consistent with the standard practice of anticipating urea effects
in data below 210 nm. From this, we can infer that the subtle changes
seen in Figure 3 centered
on 210 nm are a result of urea-induced denaturation of α-helical
structures into random coils.

Figure 5 quantifies
the mechanism behind these results, plotting the absorbance data of
0.1 M EDU, 0.1 M urea, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) samples
from 200 to 250 nm in a 1 cm quartz cuvette. Concentrations and units
were chosen to match those typically studied in circular dichroism
experiments. Urea is seen with its characteristic high absorbance
at low wavelengths, preventing reliable data collection below 210
nm. EDU, by contrast, absorbs heavily over the entire range of interest.
Although this molecule is capable of impacting readings over the entire
range, note that the error would be gradually, increasingly prominent
at lower wavelengths. This results in the EDU yielding circular dichroism
errors even at concentrations well below those deemed acceptable for
urea.

Figure 5 Absorbance profiles of 0.1 M EDU (red circles), 0.1 M urea (blue
triangles), and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (black squares) measured
in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.

From these results, we suggest a new “rule of thumb”
for the use of EDC in bioconjugation when paired with circular dichroism.
At low (<0.05 M) concentrations, EDU can be present with minimal
effect. Wavelengths above 215 nm remain largely unaffected at concentrations
encountered in the common practice of single-molecule PEGylations
of a protein.15,16 By contrast, “EDC-heavy”
syntheses, where the concentration of EDU is orders of magnitude higher
than the species of interest, would be incompatible with this molecule
due to signal loss.

At moderate solution concentrations (0–0.2
M), thoughtful
choice of wavelength ranges can be used to avoid the issue. Signal
loss increases from low wavelengths to high as a function of concentration.
Because the pattern is easily seen, signal loss thresholds from Figures 3 and 4 can be collapsed onto a single curve to generate a plot of
the lowest suggested wavelength to be taken into consideration during
secondary structure calculations as a function of EDC/EDU concentration
(Figure 6). This is
analogous to the existing practice of only considering wavelengths
higher than 210 nm for samples in urea solutions. As an example, in
a solution of 0.1 M EDU, secondary structure calculations should use
CD data only at wavelengths of 225 nm and above.

Figure 6 Minimum wavelength at
which a given EDU concentration does not
cause significant signal loss at a 1 mm path length.

To keep signal-to-noise ratios high in such circumstances,
one
should keep the total absorbance (−log I/Io)
of the sample low, typically below 1.0. Previous work has suggested
that there is a theoretical maximum in signal-to-noise ratio at an
overall sample absorbance of 0.869.11,17 This overall
absorbance includes the additives included in the sample. Common additives
for protein systems include urea at concentrations as high as 8 M.18,19 The ability to use such high concentrations of urea is possible
because the protein secondary structure characterization is evaluated
at wavelengths between 205 and 240 nm, and 8 M urea absorbs strongly
below 210 nm. Therefore, using urea as a denaturant, structural changes
inferred from signals at 222 or 225 nm are not significantly obscured.

Experimental
Procedures
A stock solution of EDU was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(E7750-10G,
Lot #SLBH9924V) and prepared by allowing a solution of the desired
final molar concentration of EDC in water to hydrolyze completely
into the urea form by standing overnight. (R)-(−)-Pantolactone
99% was purchased from Aldrich (237817-5G, Lot #07115TB) and dissolved
in DI water as a stock solution. Similarly, albumin, monomer bovine
was purchased from Sigma (A1900-250MG, Lot #031M7407V) and dissolved
in 1.0 M sodium chloride (Fisher, S271-3) to form the helical state
in solution. Sample solutions were prepared by combining these stock
solutions in additional DI/1.0 M NaCl solutions to arrive at the desired
final molar concentrations. Absorbance measurements were taken in
1 cm path length quartz cuvettes (Starna 21-Q-1) on an OLIS DSM20
in the absorbance mode. Circular dichroism measurements were made
using a 1 mm path length quartz sample cell (Starna 31-Q-1) on the
OLIS DSM20 in a circular dichroism mode.
