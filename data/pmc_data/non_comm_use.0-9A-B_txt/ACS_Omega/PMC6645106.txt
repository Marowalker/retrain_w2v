Size control has been successfully
achieved in inorganic materials,
but it still remains a challenge in organic polymers due to their
polydispersity. We here report a facial approach to tailor the diameter
of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers in a range of 200–30 nm via
temperature-controlled polymerization from room temperature to −192
°C. It is shown that the formation of PANI nanofibers was directed
by the self-assembly of an amphiphilic aniline–glutamic acid
complex, which formed micelles with different sizes at various temperatures
during polymerization. The size-dependent properties of the resulting
PANI nanofibers, such as molecular weights, optical properties, crystallinity,
and electron conductivity, have been discussed. Most importantly,
we showed a more than 3 magnitude increase in the conductivities of
doped PANI nanofibers with a decrease in the diameter from 150 to
30 nm. A homemade sensing device was
constructed, and it is shown that PANI nanofibers with smaller diameters
exhibit a much faster response than those of larger-sized fibers or
bulk PANIs due to their large surface area and high intrinsic conductivities.

Introduction
Intrinsically conductive
polymers and their nanostructured materials
have attracted great interest because of their unique characteristics,
such as tunable optical and electric properties and large surface
areas, which have many potential applications, such as in batteries,
electronic devices, electromagnetic interference, bio/chemical sensors,
and chemical sensors.1,2 Among various intrinsically conductive
polymers, polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most studied and used polymers,
owing to its unique nonredox doping/dedoping chemistry, high conductivity,
and environmental stability.3−7 Various types of nanostructures based on PANI, such as nanospheres,
nanorods, nanosheets, and nanofibers, have been successfully prepared
in the last decade,8,9 and attempts have also been made
by introducing porosity in the resulting nanostructures,10,11 modifying the surface of the nanostructures with functional groups12−14 or by coatings with metal nanoparticles.15 Among these, the PANI nanofiber was a subject of numerous works,
especially since the Kaner group developed the facile way to prepare
nanofibers without the use of templates.16,17 PANI nanofibers have shown greater sensitivity and faster time response
compared to those of its conventional bulk counterpart due to a higher
effective surface area and a shorter penetration depth for target
molecules,8 and the anisotropic geometry
of nanofiber structures offers the possibility to use PANI nanofibers
as building blocks for the fabrication of nonvolatile memories,18 supercapacitors,19,20 batteries,21 catalysis support,22 and chemical sensors.23

PANI nanofibers
have been prepared by various techniques, such
as soft and hard templating, interfacial polymerization, seeding polymerization,
and so on.6,16,17,24−29 However, in contrast to inorganic nanocrystals, the size control
of PANI nanofibers is still a challenge, due mainly to the less monodisperse
distribution of the size and shape of the PANI polymer chains.30−33 Various techniques have been successfully developed to control the
size of inorganic nanomaterials but have failed in tailoring the sizes
of PANI nanofibers.

In this work, we report an effective way
to control the sizes of
the PANI nanofibers. The diameters of PANI nanofibers could be tailored
from 200 to 30 nm by controlling the polymerization temperatures from
room temperature to −192 °C. We showed the tunable optical
and electronic properties of the resulting PANI nanofibers with different
diameters, and a 6 × 103 increase in conductivity
was observed for the PANI nanofibers with diameters changing from
200 to 30 nm. In addition, we demonstrated the size-dependent chemical
response sensitivity of the PANI nanofibers.

Results and Discussion
Tailoring
the Diameters of PANI Nanofibers
Organic
polymers cannot precisely and orderly crystallize as inorganic materials
do, and most polymer nanoparticles form through self-assembly (aggregation)
of the polymers.34−36 Emulsion and precipitation techniques are the two
main choices for the preparation of polymer nanoparticles, and with
both these techniques it is difficult to control the size and shape
of the polymers.34−36 Therefore, we proposed that the size of the polymer
nanoparticles could be tuned by controlling at the assembly step before
polymerization, because the assembly of small molecules (monomers)
is more precise than polymers. In the present work, we demonstrated
that the diameters of PANI nanofibers could be tuned by controlling
the assembly of monomers (anilines) before polymerization. As illustrated
in our previous work,25 aniline (monomer)
and glutamic acid (Glu) first form a surfactant-like complex, which
is self-assembled into nanorods (micelles) in solution. In addition,
it is well known that the micelle sizes could be remarkably affected
by the solution temperatures.37,38 Thus, it is reasonable
to assume that the sizes of micelles of the aniline–Glu complex
could be tuned by changing the solution temperatures during assembly.
To verify our hypothesis, anilines and Glu were first mixed in an
aqueous solution, which was then put into a cooling bath at different
temperatures during polymerization.

Figure 1 shows the electronic microscopy images of
the four PANI nanofibers prepared at different polymerization temperatures
from 25 to −192 °C. First, these products were found to
consist predominantly of nanofibers alongside a small amount of granular
PANI. As shown in the Supporting Information, in contrast to the traditional oxidative chemical polymerization
route, which yields mainly granular PANI,39 our method provides nearly 95% of PANI nanofibers, as can be seen
in the low-magnitude scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a
large area of the sample (Figure S1).

Figure 1 SEM (a,
c, e, g) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (b,
d, f, h) images of PANI nanofibers polymerized at different temperature:
(a, b) 25 °C; (c, d) 0 °C; (e, f) −78 °C; (g,
h) −192 °C.

Both SEM and TEM images (Figure 1) show that the diameters of the obtained
PANI nanofibers
were significantly affected by the polymerization temperatures. The
average diameters of PANI nanofibers prepared at room temperature
(25 °C), in an ice-water bath (0 °C), in an acetone/dry
ice bath (−78 °C), and in liquid nitrogen (−192
°C) are 200, 150, 60, and 30 nm, respectively. It is also interesting
to note that the lower the polymerization temperature, the narrower
the PANI nanofiber diameter distribution and larger the aspect ratio
of the fibers.

The molecular structures of the pristine PANI
nanofibers were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and the characteristic
PANI bands were obtained (Figure 2). A strong and broad band at 3450 cm–1 is attributed to the hydrogen-bonded N–H vibration.40 Vibration peaks at around 1510 and 1580 cm–1 are ascribed to C=C stretching deformations
of PANI benzenoid and quinoid rings, respectively. The peaks at 1300
and 1140 cm–1 correspond to C–N stretching
and C–H bending vibration.41 Strikingly,
we found that PANI nanofibers polymerized at room temperature and
the ice-water bath showed obvious characteristic peaks of Glu that
appeared at about 3000 cm–1, corresponding to the
C–H stretching in the amino acid. However, there are no obvious
Glu peaks in the FT-IR spectra of PANI nanofibers prepared at low
temperatures of −78 and −192 °C. These results
suggest that more Glu were buried in the PANI nanostructures that
were synthesized at a higher temperature, whereas less Glu were left
in the low-temperature polymerized PANI. This may be because Glu is
easy to be removed from smaller-sized PANI nanofibers, which have
a larger surface area. Or it may be due to the slow polymerization
process at low temperatures that facilitates the diffusion of Glu
out of the fibers, whereas at a high temperature, the rapid polymerization
that starts on the surface would wrap Glu and hinder further diffusion
of Glu out of the fiber.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of PANI nanofibers prepared at
different temperatures.

To gain insight into the formation mechanism, powder X-ray
diffraction
(XRD) patterns of PANI nanofibers prepared at different temperatures
were compared in Figure 3. A sharp peak at 2θ = 25.6° was observed for all the
PANI nanofibers synthesized at different temperatures, which was ascribed
to the periodicity alignment of the PANI polymer chains.42,43 The degree of crystallinity can be estimated from the area ratio
of the crystalline peak to the amorphous peak. PANI nanofibers prepared
at low temperatures (−78 and −192 °C) show a remarkable
increase in the (110) peak intensity. The (110) reflection corresponds
to the face-to-face interchain stacking distance between phenyl rings.44 Therefore, the increase in the intensity of
the (110) peak implies improved π–π interchain
stacking, suggesting that the structural ordering in the PANI chains
increases with the decrease in the polymerization temperature. It
is also interesting to note that strong XRD peaks were observed for
PANI nanofibers synthesized at high temperatures (room temperature
and 0 °C), centering at 2θ = 6.40, 18.5, and 19.8°.
However, these peaks became weak for PANI nanofibers synthesized at
lower temperatures of −78 and −192 °C. To better
understand the XRD pattern, pure assembly of Glu with aniline without
polymerization was studied for comparison. As described in our previous
report, 25 equal molar ratios of aniline and Glu were mixed in deionized
(DI) water to get a clear solution, which was frozen in an acetone/dry
ice bath at −78 °C without adding the polymerization agent
ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS). The resulting frozen mixture was dried
using a freeze dryer. XRD pattern of the obtained white floccules
showed sharp peaks at 2θ = 6.34, 17.4, 18.2, and 18.9°,
suggesting that these peaks were mainly coming from the assembly of
Glu and aniline (Figure S2). Therefore,
we ascribed these peaks at 2θ = 6.40, 18.5, and 19.8° to
the residues of crystallized Glu in the PANI polymer matrix. It is
consistent with the FT-IR results that more Glu’s were buried
in the PANI nanofibers synthesized at higher temperatures.

Figure 3 XRD patterns
of PANI nanofibers prepared at different temperatures.

The above information clearly suggests that the
growth of PANI
nanofibers was templated with Glu amino acids. It is generally believed
that chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline with ammonium persulfate
produces small oligomeric intermediates in the beginning of the reaction,
which continue to grow through polymerization with aniline monomers
or other oligomers. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that
in DI water, the α-carboxylic acid in Glu can bind aniline through
hydrogen bonding, forming the amphiphilic aniline–Glu complex.
The formed complex would self-assemble in water and form the nanorod
structures as observed in the SEM images.25 The subsequent PANI nanofiber growth was directed by these nanorods.
The sizes of the nanorods formed from the amphiphilic aniline–Glu
complex may change at different polymerization temperatures and thus
tune the diameters of the resulting PANI nanofibers.37,38

However, at an extremely low temperature (−192 °C),
due to a fast cooling and quick freezing of water, ice was formed
during the assembly of the amphiphilic aniline–Glu complex.
Thus, the formation of PANI nanofibers was directed not only by the
assembly of the aniline–Glu complex but also by the ice crystal
template.45,46 To confirm the role of ice-templating in
the formation of PANI nanofibers at low temperatures, the oxidative
polymerization of aniline by APS without Glu was carried out in liquid
nitrogen. As shown in Figure 4, PANI nanofibers with a fish-bone surface were obtained with
a diameter of about 50 nm. On comparing the PANI nanofibers synthesized
at −192 °C with and without the Glu template, it can be
observed that the obtained nanofibers in the presence of Glu templates
exhibit a relatively smooth surface and smaller diameters, suggesting
that the assembly of the aniline–Glu complex plays a major
role in directing the formation of PANI nanofibers at −192
°C.

and without (c, d) the presence of Glu.

Optical and Electronic Properties of PANI Nanofibers
A UV–visible
spectroscopy analysis was carried out to further
investigate the oxidation levels of PANI nanofibers. Similar to the
PANI spectra report, a dark green emeraldine form was obtained with
a distinctive polaron band at wavelengths beyond 800 nm when PANI
nanofibers were doped with a 1 M HCl solution (Figure 5a).18 When it
was dedoped with a 1 M ammonium solution, a purple-colored solution
led to a nonconducting form, with characteristic absorption at around
600 nm (Figure 5b).
A strong peak was observed at 350 nm for both doped and undoped samples,
which was assigned to the π–π* transition (within
the benzenoid segment) in pure PANI samples.47,48 The average oxidation level of the PANI nanofibers can be measurable
by comparison of the ratio of the absorbance of the polaronic band
to that of the π–π* transition.44 Judged from the peak ratios of A880/A350 nm, it can be seen clearly that PANI nanofibers with
smaller diameters appear to be in the higher oxidation level.

spectroscopy analysis of doped (a) and dedoped (b)
PANI nanofibers polymerized at different temperatures.

The conductivities of the synthesized PANIs were
measured by using
the Keithley four-point probe method, and the results are listed in Table 1. Conductivity results
showed that the as-synthesized PANI nanofibers have a much higher
conductivity than the reported neutral PANIs. This is because the
as-synthesized PANIs were partially doped with Glu. The obtained PANI
was then dedoped with ammonium oxide (0.1 M) overnight and then redoped
with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), and the conductivity was generally
increased about 1 or 2 magnitudes. Most importantly, we found that
the conductivities of both the pristine and redoped PANI nanofibers
showed a remarkable increase with the decrease in the diameters of
the PANI nanofibers. For CSA-doped PANI nanofibers, the conductivity
of PANI synthesized at −192 °C is more than 3 magnitudes
higher than that prepared at room temperature.

The high conductivities of the PANI nanofibers synthesized
at lower
temperatures than those prepared at higher temperatures may be due
to the different fiber sizes, crystallinity, and molecular weight
of the polymer. Generally, the smaller diameter induces a larger contact
surface, which leads to a larger contacting area in the pressed PANI
nanofiber pellets for the conductivity measurement. In addition, we
noted that PANI nanofibers prepared at low temperatures showed increased
crystallinity and intensity of (110) peak, suggesting improved π–π
interchain stacking in the smaller-diameter PANI nanofibers. The better
structural ordering leads to enhanced charge-carrier transport through
elongation of the effective conjugation length.

Furthermore,
it has been reported that the conductivity of PANI
was also affected by the molecular weights of the polymer. That is,
the longer the conjugated polymer chain, the longer the electron delocalization.3,49 We measured the intrinsic viscosity of the synthesized PANIs to
estimate the relative molecular weight of the obtained PANI nanofibers.
As shown in the specific viscosity measurement results (Figure S3 and Table S1), the intrinsic viscosity
(dL/g) of PANIs (dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP)) are 13.22, 21.28, 36, and 54.32 for the fibers synthesized
at 25, 0, −78, and −192 °C, respectively, suggesting
an increasing molecular weight of the prepared PANI nanofibers with
decreasing polymerization temperature.

Size-Dependent Chemical
Sensitivity of PANI Nanofibers
The formed PANI nanofibers
showed significant enhancement of chemical
sensitivity compared to that of the bulky PANI prepared by a traditional
oxidative polymerization method. To demonstrate the gas sensitivity
of the obtained PANI nanofibers, a homemade gas sensor was constructed
using an SPI silver paste with the help of a 3 mm wide tape as a mask
(Figure S4). After annealing the silver
paste at 120 °C for 1 h, one drop of the dedoped PANI aqueous
solution was solution-cast on the gas sensor between the two electrodes
and dried in atmosphere overnight. The gas sensor was then connected
to a digital multimeter, and the device was sealed in a chamber filled
with 1 M HCl solution with stirring. For comparison, bulky PANI was
also prepared by traditional APS oxidative polymerization of aniline
in an aqueous solution and then dedoped with a 1 M ammonium solution
overnight. The dedoped PANIs were not conductive with a resistance
of few GΩ, but their resistance rapidly changed to a few MΩ
or tens of KΩ in minutes. Figure 6 shows the typical response data for dedoped PANI exposed
to 100 ppm of HCl vapor. The resistances of the dedoped PANI nanofibers
show faster and larger response to acid vapor than the bulky PANI.
Resistances of dedoped PANI nanofibers changed by 3–5 orders
of magnitude on exposure to the HCl vapor, and the smaller the diameter
of nanofibers, the faster the response time.

Figure 6 Normalized resistance
measured vs time upon exposure of dedoped
PANI to 100 ppm of HCl with bulky PANI and different sizes of PANI
nanofibers.

The size-dependent sensor
response was attributed to the following
factors. First, the sensor response is dependent on the diffusion
of the acid vapor through the PANI film on the gas sensor, which is
affected by the surface area and the porosity of the film. The smaller
the diameter of the PANI nanofibers, the faster is the response to
the acid vapor because the surface area is inversely related to the
nanofiber diameters. Moreover, TEM images of the PANI nanofiber showed
that the nanofiber prepared at a lower temperature has a more rough
surface as compared to that prepared at a temperature above 0 °C.
Second, the greatly enhanced sensor capability of the smaller-sized
PANI nanofibers that were prepared at a low temperature may also be
related to their higher conductivities, as we have discussed above.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile synthetic approach to tune
the diameters of
PANI nanofibers and their size-dependent sensing application were
demonstrated. Our results showed that the growth of PANI nanofibers
was directed by the assembly of the amphiphilic aniline–Glu
complex, and the sizes of micelles of the complex could be controlled
by the polymerization temperatures. In addition, the formation of
ice at extremely low temperatures also plays a part in controlling
the fiber diameter. The structural, optical, and electronic properties
of PANI nanofibers synthesized at different temperatures were discussed.
We showed a more than 3 magnitude increase of the conductivities of
PANI nanofibers with diameters changing from 200 to 30 nm. The application
of the size-controlled PANI nanofibers in a gas sensor was also demonstrated.
This work provides a way for constructing more sensitive PANI-based
sensors, together with the potential applications in the fields of
catalysis, supercapacitors, and memories.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aniline (≥99%) was purchased from
Aldrich and vacuum-distilled before use. APS, Glu (99%), NMP, and
CSA were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further
purification. DI water (18.2 MΩ) was used throughout the experiment,
and all glassware was cleaned using concentrated nitric acid and subsequently
rinsed with a copious amount of DI water.

Preparation of PANI Nanofibers
PANI nanofibers were
synthesized by a chemical oxidation polymerization method in the presence
of amino acid templates, as reported previously.25 Typically, 1 mmol (0.147 g) l-Glu was added into
10 mL of DI water and quickly degassed with Argon gas for 2 min. The
reactor was put into an ultrasonication bath for 10 min with an ice-water
bath. Then, freshly distilled aniline (1 mmol, 92 μL) was added
to the mixture in one portion, and the reactor was put in the ultrasonication
bath again until both aniline and l-Glu were dissolved to
give a clear solution.

In another reactor, 1 mmol of APS (0.228
g) was dissolved in 2 mL of water with the help of ultrasonication.
The APS solution was then rapidly added into the clear mixture of
aniline and l-Glu with gentle shaking for about 10 s without
color change. The reaction mixture was then put into a water bath
at 25 °C and kept at this temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture
was left without disturbing overnight. The obtained PANI fibers were
separated by centrifugation of the reaction mixture at 8000 rpm for
15 min, and the centrifuge pellets were redispersed in DI water. The
centrifugation and washing with DI water was repeated for several
cycles until the supernatant became light green.

The PANI nanofibers
synthesized at different temperatures were
prepared by the same method, except the mixed APS and aniline were
put into different cooling baths: ice-water bath (0 °C), acetone/dry
ice bath (−78 °C), and liquid nitrogen (−192 °C).
For the PANI nanofibers synthesized at low temperatures (−78
and −192 °C), a further 2 h reaction at room temperature
is required to complete the polymerization. The yields of the obtained
PANI nanofibers were in the range of 35–45%. The outer diameter
of the obtained PANI nanofibers that were prepared at room temperature
(25 °C), in an ice-water bath (0 °C), in an acetone/dry
ice bath (−78 °C), and in liquid nitrogen (−192
°C) were found to be 200, 150, 60, and 30 nm, respectively. The
corresponding aspect ratios were found to be 12, 18, 22, and 33.

Characterization
SEM images of the samples were obtained
by using a JEOL field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM)
JSM6700F FESEM at 5 kV acceleration voltages. TEM micrographs were
obtained using a JEOL 2100TEM operating at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. A drop of the sample dispersed in water was cast onto a
200-mesh carbon-coated copper grid. The samples were dried at room
temperature before measurement.

UV–vis spectra were recorded
on a Shimadzu 3600 UV–vis near-infrared (UV–vis–NIR)
Spectrophotometer. The XRD pattern measurement was done on a Bruker
D8 General Area Detector Diffraction System with Cu Kα radiation.
Samples for XRD analysis was prepared by drop-casting of the sample
solution onto a silicon wafer substrate and dried at room temperature.
The cyclic voltammograms of PANI nanofibers were carried out on an
Auto lab potentiostat. PANI fibers were deposited on glass carbon
and used as a working electrode. Pt and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrodes
were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

The molecular weight of PANI was measured by a Cannon-Ubbelohde
dilution viscometer at room temperature. The efflux time for NMP was
recorded at first as a reference. Synthesized PANI (50 mg) was dissolved
in 10 mL of NMP containing LiCl (0.2 wt %), and the efflux time was
recorded. Then, the PANI solution was diluted by adding 5 mL of NMP–LiCl
(0.2 wt %), and the efflux time was measured again. This step was
repeated until final solution contained 25 mL of the NMP–LiCl
solvent. The relative molecular weight of PANI was compared by its
relative calculated intrinsic viscosity.

The Keithley four-point
probe system at room temperature was used
for the electrical conductivity test. In a typical measurement, a
constant current was passed through the two outer probes, and the
corresponding potential drop across the middle two probes was measured.
The current was systematically increased four times, and corresponding
potential drop values were recorded. All measurements were repeated
at four different contact points on the surface, and the average values
were calculated. Then, the current versus voltage graph was plotted,
and the slope of the graph was used for the calculation of resistivity
and hence conductivity.
