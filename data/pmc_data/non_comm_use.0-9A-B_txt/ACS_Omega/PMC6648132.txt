This paper reports
a new approach to realize direct selective electroless
deposition (ELD) without the requirement of photolithography. This
method involves sequential silane-compound modifications in which
the first modification creates a hydrophobic surface on the TiO2-coated glass using a fluorine-rich alkoxysilane compound,
followed by a laser ablation to create the pattern. Then, the entire
substrate is immersed into an aqueous solution containing amino-silane
equipped Pd nanoparticles for the second modification. Because most
substrate surface is hydrophobic, the amino-silane-equipped Pd catalysts
can only graft on the laser-ablated zone to accomplish selective ELD.

==== Body
Introduction
Electroless deposition (ELD) of metal
is an important wet process
for metallizing noncondutive substrates in circuit board and semiconductor
industries.1−4 To form metal lines or interconnects of the electronic circuitry,
photolithography process involving photoresist coating, photomask
aligning, photoresist development, and multiple etchings is widely
adopted to create selected sites for ELD. Because photolithography
process is tedious and time-consuming, developing alternative methods
with shortened steps or even without the need of photomask has become
progressively attractive.

The key to realizing direct selective
metallization in ELD is to
deposit noble-metal catalyst in the desired pattern for the initiation
of ELD, either in the form of metal precursors5,6 or
atomic metals.7−9 In attempts to get rid of the use of photomask,10−13 microcontact printing,14−16 inkjet printing,17−20 or direct pen writing21,22 of catalyst ink have
been studied to realize direct selective ELD on various substrates.
It is reported the overall performance of direct selective metallization
is highly sensitive to the formula of catalyst ink as well as the
property of the substrate.

In this study, we developed a unique
approach to realize photomask-free,
selective ELD on glass using sequential silane-compound treatments
and laser patterning. In particular, the first treatment involves
using a fluorine-rich silane compound to form a hydrophobic surface.
This hydrophobic surface repels Pd catalyst adsorption from an aqueous
solution and thus prevents ELD to serve as an invisible, molecule-level
photomask. Then, patterning the substrate by laser ablation to expose
selective sites. Those exposed sites are then activated by an amino-silane-equipped
Pd nanoparticle for triggering ELD. This approach not only completely
eliminates photomask-related processes but also minimizes the usage
of expensive Pd catalysts. In this paper, we examine and explain the
process using various tools such as water contact angel (WCA) measurement,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). In the meantime,
we also provide perspective for practical application of this protocol
in the future.

Results and Discussion
Every step
in the above-mentioned direct selective ELD process
is examined using various tools, and the result is summarized in Figure 1. It can be seen
the process contains five main steps including titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating, hydrophobic surface formation, laser patterning,
selective Pd adsorption, and ELD nickel–phosphorous (Ni–P).
Before TiO2 coating, the cleaned substrate surface is very
hydrophilic and smooth as the WCA and surface roughness (Sa) is 0° and 0.2 nm, respectively. After TiO2 coating, WCA became 16.6° and the AFM topography reveals
a rugged surface (Sa = 3.9 nm) composed
of particles with different sizes from several tens of nanometers,
evidencing hydrophilic TiO2 is compactly coated on the
surface. When the TiO2-coated glass is grafted by 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES), the AFM topography appeared
almost unchanged, but the WCA increased sharply to 113.3°, hinting
the CF moieties of PFOTES were situated upwardly. It should be noted
when we immersed the substrate of this stage into aqueous 3-2-(2-aminoethylamino)
ethylamino propyl trimethoxysilane–poly(vinyl alcohol)-capped
palladium (ETAS–PVA–Pd) catalyst suspension and then
ELD Ni-P bath, no ELD occurred due to the hydrophobicity of the surface.
When the PFOTES-grafted surface was patterned by laser, WCA of the
ablated zone became nearly zero again, indicating not only TiO2 but also PFOTES has been largely ablated by laser beam and
the surface of the substrate returned to its initial hydrophilicity. Sa at this stage was 41.6 nm, indicating a certain
amount of TiO2 residue was left on the substrate due to
intensified adhesion of TiO2 during sintering treatment.
When the laser-patterned substrate was immersed into the aqueous ETAS–PVA–Pd
solution, the morphology of laser-ablated zone changed again as few
spots were revealed, whereas the area that was not processed by laser
beam remain unchanged. The WCA of the laser-ablated zone after ETAS–PVA–Pd
adsorption is 16.7°, which is an evidence of successful ETAS–PVA–Pd
grafting.23 Interestingly, the WCA of the
area that was not treated by laser remained 104.3°, indicating
the hydrophobic surface indeed repelled water-based ETAS–PVA–Pd.
During ELD Ni–P, the metallization can only be initiated in
the zones with ETAS–PVA–Pd adsorption, the rest of the
area remained transparent because of the absence of catalyst as shown
in the bottom photo of Figure 1. Eventually, direct selective ELD of Ni–P on glass
is accomplished via this photomask-free, facile process.

Figure 1 Schematic diagrams
of the metallization process developed in this
study.

Apparently, control of surface
hydrophilicity is a key in the process.
Consequently, in the following sections, we discuss PFOTES modification
in detail using XPS. Figure 2a is the XPS survey scans of the TiO2-coated glasses
before and after PFOTES grafting. It can be seen that CF, F 1s, and
F KLL signals representing C–F polar covalent bond, fluorine,
and fluorine Auger peak were clearly detected, indicating the grafting
of PFOTES was successful. The F 1s, Ti 2p, and O 1s spectra before
and after PFOTES grafting were zoomed-in in Figure 2b–d, respectively. As can be seen
in Figure 2b, the deconvoluted
F 1s spectrum contains two peaks at 686.84 and 687.89 eV, which represent
terminal CF3 and interval CF2 moieties, respectively.24 In Figure 2c, the Ti spectrum of the TiO2-coated substrate
before PFOTES grafting shows two peaks at 465.69 and 458.99 eV, corresponding
to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, respectively.25 After the PFOTES grafting, both peaks shifted
to higher binding energies by approximately 0.4 eV due to the interference
of electronegative CFx moieties. On the
contrary, the O 1s spectrum of TiO2-coated glass shown
in Figure 2d was composed
of multiple contributions including a main peak at 530.26 eV from
TiO2 and two minor peaks at 531.75 and 533.20 eV from OH–
and SiO2, respectively.25,26 The presence
of SiO2 signal hints the coverage of TiO2 coating
is not perfect but satisfactory due to weak intensity. After PFOTES
grafting, two additional peaks were found, in which a major peak at
530.71 eV was assigned to Ti–O–Si and a minor peak at
532.32 eV assigned to Si–O–C were deconvoluted.27 The finding of Ti–O–Si contribution
is a direct evidence that PFOTES grafting occurs on TiO2 via silanol head group and CFx tails
were not involved in the grafting. The minor contribution of Si–O–C
implies a small portion of PFOTES was horizontally connected, which
leaves room for future improvement of the PFOTES grafting process.

(d) O 1s spectra of TiO2-coated glass and PFOTES-grafted
TiO2-coated glass.

Figure 3 shows
the
FESEM images of the sample after ELD, in which Figure 3a–c illustrates the top view of the
sample. It can be seen that the line width of the laser pattern is
approximately 30 μm, but the ELD Ni–P width grid became
90 μm, indicating that ELD is seriously spilled. The spillover
of line width can be explained by the heat effect of laser processing.

Figure 3 (a) Top-view
image of the entire ELD area, (b) magnification of
zone 2 and zone 3, (c) magnification of zone 1 and zone 2, and (d)
imaginary cross-sectional structure of the entire ELD area and three
representative FESEM images.

The imaginary illustration in Figure 3d shows that when laser beam ablates the
PFOTES-grafted TiO2, not only the laser spotting sites
but also the nearby area will be affected due to focused laser energy
and poor heat conduction of the glass, resulting in the formation
of two zones, the laser-irradiated zone (LIZ) and the laser-affected
zone (LAZ), on the workpiece.28 The LIZ
receives laser energy directly and conducts the heat to LAZ. In our
experiment, 30 μm wide laser beam was designed to ablate the
PFOTES-coated TiO2 film, but it turned out that the overall
ablated width reached 90 μm, meaning the LAZ is even wider than
LIZ, indicating the PFOTES protection was damaged in the LAZ due to
the poor heat conduction of the glass substrate. We believe this drawback
can be mitigated by applying heat sink or thermoelectric chip in the
bottom of the glass in the future. Consequently, ELD Ni–P occurred
on both LIZ and LAZ. As also shown in Figure 3d, the TiO2 coating in LAZ is
clearly observed.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that
the surface modification by fluorine-rich alkoxysilane
grafting can be utilized as an invisible photomask with molecular
thickness level, which can be applied in direct selective ELD by simple
laser patterning and Pd activator adsorption. We also find the ELD
Ni–P line is 3 times wider than the laser ablated line due
to the poor thermal conductivity of the glass substrate. Future optimization
can be realized by minimizing the area of LAZ using either passive
cooling or active cooling, both of which are underway in our laboratory.

Experimental
Section
A piece of alkali-free glass (Eagle XG, Corning Corporation)
is
used as the substrate. Before metallization, the substrate was cleaned
using standard RCA (NH4OH/H2O2/H2O = 1:1:5) treatment for 20 min to remove organic species,
followed by rinsing with deionized water. After cleaning, the substrate
was coated with a thin TiO2 film by spin-coating an isopropyl
alcohol solution containing titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
(Aldrich) of concentration 0.15 M, and the spin speed is 6000 rpm
for 20 s. After spin-coating, the substrate coated with a thin TiO2 film sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The purpose of this
thin TiO2 coating is because TiO2 can adsorb
the energy of laser beams, so it can be ablated by subsequent laser
treatment. The TiO2-coated substrate was then immersed
in a toluene (99.5%, J.T.Baker) solution containing 1 vol % PFOTES
(Gelest) for 30 min, followed by baking at 150 °C for 30 min
to form the Si–O–Si covalent bond between PFOTES, form
Ti–O–Si covalent bond between PFOTES and TiO2, and remove toluene traces. After PFOTES modification, the surface
of the substrate turned hydrophobic due to the presence of CF moieties.29−31 A fiber laser beam with 1062 nm wavelength (LMF-S, EZLASER, Taiwan)
was used to pattern the PFOTES-grafted substrate. Laser power is 10
W, with a scan rate of 100 mm/s. After laser patterning, the substrate
was immersed into an aqueous solution containing 50 ppm of ETAS–PVA–Pd
nanoparticles for 5 min at room temperature. The ETAS–PVA–Pd
was synthesized according to our previous reports.23,32 Amino moieties on ETAS–PVA–Pd can graft on the glass
surface, which is opened by laser. Finally, the substrate was selectively
ELD in a commercial Ni–P bath (NDF-1, UYEMURA, Japan) at 85
°C for 1 min.
