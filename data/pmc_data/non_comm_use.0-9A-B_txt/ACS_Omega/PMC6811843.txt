In
this study, a simple formulation of softwood-derived glycol
lignin (GL)-based epoxy resin with a high GL content of greater than
50 wt % was demonstrated by direct mixing with poly(ethylene glycol)
diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), an aliphatic epoxide, without using any
solvent. Because the GL powder produced from poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG400) solvolysis of Japanese cedar softwood meal was a PEG400-modified
lignin (GL400), a strong affinity between PEG counterparts facilitates
the uniform mixing of GL400 with PEGDGE, and one component uncured
GL400/PEGDGE epoxy resin was prepared at a relatively lower temperature
(100 °C) than the curing temperature (130 °C). The epoxy
curing reaction was monitored by 1H NMR and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopies. The physical and mechanical properties of
the epoxy resins with different GL400 contents were then evaluated.
The developed resins exhibited good flexibility and elasticity depending
on the GL400 content.

Introduction
Lignin is one of the
main components of wood cells, in addition
to cellulose and hemicellulose, and is referred to as the most abundant
natural resources of aromatic biopolymer.1,2 On
the other hand, lignin derivatives obtained from traditional pulp
industries typically exhibit excess denaturation and contain many
impurities because degradation of lignin by product was allowed to
keep pulp quality to the maximum so that the direct use of the lignin
derivatives is slightly difficult as industrial raw materials. In
addition, the nonuniformity of lignin due to different plant species
also hinders its widespread use as a chemical raw material.3 Recently, a novel method to extract lignin under
mild chemical conditions using unutilized Japanese cedar forest thinning
samples has been reported.4 A strategy
for the large-scale production of lignin derivatives by the acid-catalyzed
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solvolysis of softwood to commercialize
the cedar–lignin-based fabrication of advanced functional materials
has been reported.5 The use of the nonvolatile
PEG solvent promotes the solvolysis process under atmospheric pressure
as well as the chemical introduction of PEG into the isolated lignin
macromolecules, resulting in PEG-modified lignin derivatives called
glycol lignin (GL).4,5 In addition, cell walls of softwoods
are exclusively composed of guaiacyl (G) units in terms of the aromatic
unit compositions as a lignin component. Thus, GLs produced from the
direct isolation of softwood Japanese cedar have less structural heterogeneity
and very low impurities,5 which has been
considered as potential feedstock for a wide range of industrial applications.
For example, we have recently reported the GL/clay nanocomposite film
having high thermal durability, high oxygen gas, and moisture vapor
barrier properties, applicable as printed electronic substrates to
fabricate touch sensor devices.6−8

Here, we focused on the
development of GL-based epoxy resin using
GL as a natural phenol compound. The utilization of renewable resources
for sustainable technology is attracting attention because of their
availability and meeting environmental requirements such as low ecotoxicity
and biodegradability. Therefore, significant effort on research and
development of bio-based epoxy resins to substitute petrochemical-based
resins has been explored to meet the increasing demands of green industries.1,9 Epoxy resins are widely used in a variety of industries, such as
adhesives, coatings, insulations, and high-performance composites
because of their versatility in manipulating the ultimate properties
and performances in terms of strength, durability, and thermal and
chemical resistances as provided by high cross-linked structures.
To transform epoxy resins into cross-linked networks with desirable
properties, a raw epoxide material is cured with a curing agent. The
use of lignin as the curing agent has been studied because of its
interesting characteristics, including heat resistance and chemical
structural robustness.10−13 Like other commercially available lignin derivatives, the GL used
in this work is a powder form having a thermal flow temperature (Tf) of >140 °C,5 which is typically higher than the curing polymerization temperature
of epoxy resins. The higher Tf prevents
uniform mixing with resins in their liquid form before curing. In
one of our reports, the sealing material was fabricated by dissolving
GL in some polar organic solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylformamide, and PEG, to mix with epoxy chemicals.14 However, the use of solvents poses issues including
the decrease in the GL content to less than 50% in the resulting resin
and the deterioration in its physical properties due to the residual
solvent within the resin. Because the boiling points of such solvents
are higher than the curing temperature, complete removal of the residual
solvent by drying at a certain temperature before curing needs to
be done. In this study, a solvent-free epoxy resin with high lignin
content was prepared by thermal curing using GL as the curing agent.
As GL is a PEG-modified lignin derivative, a counter epoxy chemical
containing PEG polymer, like poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether
(PEGDGE), was selected to solve the solubility and uniform mixing
between the curing agent (GL) and the epoxy chemical (PEGDGE). PEGDGE
is a commercially available epoxide material in its liquid state and
is composed of terminal epoxy groups in its PEG molecular structure.

The working strategy is the chemistry of “like-dissolves-like”
rule. Mixing PEG containing the curing agent in the powder form and
the epoxy chemical in the liquid state at a certain temperature lower
than the curing temperature without using additional organic solvent
was done as a preliminary test, and suitable thermal mixing temperature
of 100 °C was set for this study. The available GL content that
can be dissolved in PEGDGE was carried out to optimize the best epoxy
resin compositions. The chemical equivalent weights of the phenolic
hydroxyl groups of GL and the epoxy curing reaction were determined
by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
respectively. The mechanical properties of GL/PEGDGE epoxy resins
with various GL contents were then investigated.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
of the GL/PEGDGE Epoxy Resin
The assumed
molecular structures of GL (GL400) and PEGDGE used in the present
work are illustrated in Figure 1. GL400 is one of the cedar-derived GL materials, in which
lignin from cedar is modified by poly(ethylene glycol) with an average
molecular weight of ca. 400. The structure of GL400 in Figure 1 is a model that has been redesigned
so that the molecular weight and functional groups of the material
used in the present work can be understood, according to the structural
characterization of glycol lignin investigated in the previous co-authors’
literature.5 The structure of PEGDGE is
simply designed as is according to the information on this commercially
available substance.

Figure 1 Molecular structures of GL400 and PEGDGE.

The illustration of the preparation of elastomeric GL400-epoxy
resin is shown in Figure 2. The employed mixing process allows the preparation of GL/PEGDGE
ratios with GL400 content as high as 71 wt %. Uniform mixing could
not be performed if the GL content was higher than 71 wt %, due to
the very high viscosity of the mixture (Table 1). Since it was confirmed that GL400 or PEGDGE
alone could not react to give any cured resin under the same preparation
conditions, as shown in Figure 2, such resin is clearly decided to be a product of polymerization
between GL400 and PEGDGE. Notably, elastomeric GL-based epoxy resin
with GL content of more than half was successfully obtained by this
solvent-free simple formulation. The developed GL-epoxy resin was
extremely flexible and exhibited elastic repulsion when bent (Figure 2), probably due to
the flexible molecular nature of the aliphatic epoxide, PEGDGE. On
the other hand, the GL-epoxy resin was not sufficiently cured when
GL400 content of less than or equal to 50 wt % was applied even after
thermal curing at 130 °C. DSC was employed to check the curing
behavior of the GL-epoxy resin and the result is shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure S1). There were no
clear exo- and endothermic peaks, but quite broad ones that seemed
to be exothermic at around 70 and 120 °C, respectively. Because
the GL-epoxy mixture was still liquid at 70 °C in the actual
resin curing process, no curing reaction still occurred, suggesting
that the peak indicates a kind of a reaction of GL itself by heating.
At above 120 °C, the GL-epoxy mixture was cured to a solid, which
reveals that the second broad peak seems to be an exothermic reaction
of curing. From this result, an oven curing temperature of 130 °C
was suitable for the GL-epoxy resin.

of GL-epoxy resin.

Mechanism of the Curing Reaction and Determination of the Phenolic
Hydroxyl Group of GL400
ATR-FTIR spectra of the GL-epoxy
resin with 62.5 wt % GL400 content before and after thermal curing
as well as control samples are shown in Figure 3a. The absorption peak at 911 cm–1 corresponding to the characteristic of an epoxide (oxirane ring)15,16 observed in uncured GL-epoxy resin was remarkably diminished in
ATR-FTIR spectra of cured GL-epoxy resin, whereas the hydroxyl (O–H)
absorption at 3350 cm–1 did not change significantly.
On the other hand, the characteristic epoxide absorption peak at 911
cm–1 was observed in the ATR-FTIR spectra of the
cured GL-epoxy resin with lower GL400 content of 41.2 wt % (Figure S2). The presence of the epoxide absorption
peak even after thermal curing for this composition ratio indicated
that the formulation of the composition ratio is integral to achieve
suitable curing conditions. Owing to the reactive functional groups
of GL400 (phenolic hydroxyl group) and PEGDGE (epoxide), nucleophilic
addition of epoxy occurred during the thermal curing of the GL–PEGDGE
mixture. Hence, it is assumed that the phenoxide generated from the
phenolic hydroxyl group of GL serves as a nucleophile for nucleophilic
addition to the epoxide (Figure 3b).10,17,18

to specify the epoxide absorption peak at 911 cm–1. (b) Curing mechanism of GL400 and PEGDGE.

To quantify the phenolic hydroxyl groups of GL400 involved in the
curing reaction, quantitative 1H NMR measurements were
performed. All GL400 samples were subjected to acetylation to improve
the quantification of the phenolic hydroxyl groups before 1H NMR measurement.19,20Figure 4 shows the ATR-FTIR and 1H NMR
spectra of acetylated GL400. The ATR-FTIR spectra of acetylated and
nonacetylated GL400 were compared. The acetylation of the hydroxyl
groups of GL400 was confirmed by the decrease in the absorption of
the hydroxyl group (O–H) at around 3350 cm–1 and an increase in the absorption of the carbonyl group (C=O)
at ∼1737 cm–1 (Figure 4a). In the 1H NMR spectrum of
acetylated GL400, the signals corresponding to the acetyl groups were
observed at 2.00 and 2.23 ppm (Figure 4b). The signal at 2.00 ppm was caused by the formation
of an ester by the acetylation of an aliphatic alcoholic hydroxyl
group such as PEG, whereas the signal at 2.23 ppm was caused by the
formation of a phenyl ester by the acetylation of a phenolic hydroxyl
group.19,20 The 1H NMR integral ratio of
the phenyl ester of the acetylated GL400 to PFA revealed that 2.2–2.6
mmol of the phenolic hydroxyl group is present per gram21 of GL400, according to eqs 1 and 2,22,23 and the weight per functional equivalent of the phenolic hydroxyl
group of GL400 is 385–455 g/equiv (Table 2). 1   2  where I, N, W, M, P, n, and m represent

of protons, gravimetric weight, molar mass, purity, amount of substance,
and molar amounts of the phenolic hydroxyl group in 1 g of GL400,
standard (std), analyte functional group (X), analyte, and acetylated
GL400 (sample), respectively. Because lignin might have a quite complex
structure without unified molecular composition, five deviations were
emphasized rather than showing the average value. From the calculation,
a GL400 to PEGDGE weight ratio of 59–63 wt % was possibly indicative
of the chemical equivalent of the epoxy curing reaction assumed in Figure 3b. This assumption
was in agreement with the results summarized in Table 1. The GL400 content of >50 wt % was crucial
to achieve a sufficient curing condition and GL400 content of >58.8
wt % led to the elastomeric nature of the resin.

Mechanical Properties of
the GL-Epoxy Resin
For a more
detailed characterization on the flexible and elastomeric nature of
the resins, the mechanical properties of the GL-epoxy resins with
various compositions were investigated through hardness and tensile
tests. Figure 5 summarizes
the durometer hardness, tensile modulus and strength, and elongation
at the break of the GL-epoxy resins with various GL400 contents. The
mechanical properties totally tend to be low compared with those of
traditional hard epoxy resins but the strength against elongation
is only remarkable. Therefore, the developed GL-epoxy resins in this
work are elastomeric type and the values are comparable with those
of typical elastomeric and flexible epoxy materials.24,25 The flexible nature of GL-epoxy resins originated not only from
PEGDGE but also partially from GL400 as GL itself was PEG-substituted
lignin macromolecules, where the substituted PEG chains provide as
a soft segment in GL macromolecules. By examining the physical and
mechanical properties of GL-epoxy resins as a function of GL400 content,
the hardness of the GL-epoxy resins gradually increased with the GL400
content and achieved rubber-like hardness at GL400 contents of 71–55
wt % (Figure 5a). On
the other hand, the tensile modulus and strength of the GL-epoxy resins
rapidly increased at a high GL400 content (Figure 5a,b). The tensile elongation at break was
greater than 20% in all samples, indicative of a certain amount of
reversible flexibility for the GL-epoxy resin (Figure 5b), and it increased with the GL content
similar to hardness but it rapidly increased at a GL content of around
60% and did not increase beyond this point. These tendencies of physical
properties are related to the equivalence point of GL400 and PEGDGE
to achieve sufficient curing polymerization as described above. The
ideal ratio of GL400 to PEGDGE estimated from NMR quantification for
the polymerization reaction was 59–63 wt %, which is similar
to the boundary value that existed in Figure 5, suggesting that mechanical properties are
strongly influenced by the curing reaction between both molecules
being influenced by the composition. The tensile properties were apparently
linked directly to the flexibility of the polymer chains in the resins.
As shown in Figure 5, the lower the content of the flexible aliphatic PEGDGE molecules,
the higher the value of the tensile properties, particularly at a
GL400 content greater than 60 wt %. On the other hand, the hardness
of the resins was not directly related to the extension of polymer
molecules but instead related to the nature of polymer components
themselves. Considering the proportional increase in hardness with
increase in the GL content, GL400 served as a curing agent as well
as a filler to enhance the hardness of the GL-epoxy resin itself.26 Taking advantage of the features of the flexible
and thermoplastic GL-epoxy resin that has been found in the present
work, plastic products that require adequate strength and elasticity
can contribute to the widespread use as valuable wood-derived natural
materials.

elongation and tensile strength of the GL-epoxy resins comprising
various composition ratios of GL400. The gray area represents an equivalent
weight ratio between GL400 and PEGDGE.

In summary, a simple formulation of bio-based elastomeric epoxy
resin containing biomass resources of more than half was demonstrated
by solvent-free mixing of PEG-modified glycol lignin produced from
softwood meal and aliphatic epoxide material, PEGDGE, at a moderate
curing temperature of 130 °C. The sufficient curing condition
was monitored by the disappearance of characteristic epoxide absorption
band (911 cm–1) using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy over
a wide range of composition ratios. 1H NMR analysis further
confirmed that the chemical equivalent, that is, weight per functional
equivalent of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the curing agent GL400
and PEGDGE resin, is crucial to determine the sufficient curing conditions
of the GL-epoxy resins. The mixing ratio of GL400 of 59−63
wt % was found to be the chemical equivalent composition of the sufficient
epoxy curing reaction, which also indicated as a boundary for the
abrupt change in tensile properties of the GL-epoxy resins. On the
other hand, the properties of hardness depend on the GL400 content,
where GL400 served as a curing agent as well as a filler to enhance
the hardness of the GL-epoxy resin. The GL-epoxy resins formulated
in this work are expected to be used in the production of sealing
materials as well as structural matrix material, which is then reinforced
by fibers. As a large-scale GL production technology from softwood
has already been developed,5 the development
of GL-based functional materials other than GL-epoxy resins are also
expected to meet the need of the future green industries.

Experimental
Section
Materials
GL was prepared according to a previously
reported method.4,5 The details of the synthesis method,
the composition of lignin, and the characteristics of the molecular
structure have already been given, so refer to these reports. In the
present work, PEG400-modified glycol lignin (GL400) was used in which
poly(ethylene glycol) with an average molecular weight of 380–420
is used for the modification. The GL400 used in this work is not exactly
the same as in the previous papers because there are a lot of differences
on cedar and molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol) used, but such
slight differences are negligible for the chemical process in the
present work. PEGDGE with an average molecular weight of 540 and a
purity of greater than 99% was purchased from Kyoeisha Chemical Co.,
Ltd. For 1H NMR measurements, analytical grade acetic anhydride,
pyridine, and pentafluorobenzaldehyde (PFA, 98%) were purchased from
FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemicals Corporation. All reagents were used without
further purification.

Fabrication of the GL-Epoxy Resin
GL400/PEGDGE epoxy
resins containing 41–83 wt % of GL400 were prepared by mixing
with an appropriate amount of GL400 and PEGDGE as shown in Table 1. In addition, it
was also confirmed whether GL400 or PEGDGE alone would react under
the same heating conditions. Briefly, a designated amount of GL400
powder was first mixed with PEGDGE in a 300 mL flask at room temperature.
The mixture was stirred (60 rpm) at 100 °C for 4 h under the
sealed condition to obtain uncured GL400-epoxy resin. The uncured
GL-epoxy resin was then cast into a Teflon mold (110 × 110 mm2) and thermally cured in an oven at 130 °C for 60 h.
The elastomeric GL-epoxy resin sheet, 1.4–1.6 mm thick, was
finally obtained after thermal curing.

Characterizations of the
GL-Epoxy Resin
ATR-FTIR spectra
were recorded using Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer equipped
with a diamond attenuated total reflection (ATR) attachment over the
range of 4000–550 cm–1.

Thermogravimetric
and differential thermal analysis (TG–DTA) profiles of the
GL-epoxy resins were determined using Rigaku Thermo Olus EVO2 TG–DTA
analyzer. The samples were loaded onto a Pt pan and heated from room
temperature to 400 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min under
the airflow (500 mL/min). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
profiles were recorded using Rigaku Thermo Plus DSC 8230. For DSC
measurements, no reference lignin material as a standard was used.
The samples were loaded onto Al pan and heated from room temperature
to 250 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen flow
(100 mL/min). Shore A hardness was measured on a Shore durometer GS-719G
(Teclock Corporation). Samples with a thickness of up to 6 mm were
used for the measurement. An average of five measurements was performed.
Tensile tests were carried out on a Tokyo Koki Testing Machine Co.,
Ltd. using an LSC-005/30 force gauge equipped with a load cell of
50 N. The epoxy resin after curing was cut into strips (10 ×
110 mm2) as the test sample. The sample strip was fixed
from both sides using a gauge with a length of 40 mm and pulled with
a load rate of 1 mm/min. All tests were conducted at room temperature
(25 °C). An average of six measurements was carried out.

Determination
of the Phenolic Hydroxyl Group of GL400 by 1H NMR Spectroscopy
First, 1.0 g of GL400 was added
into 20 mL mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine (1:1, v/v) in
a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Second, the mixture was stirred (60 °C,
200 rpm) for 8 h under reflux at 20 °C. Third, the mixture was
reprecipitated by dropwise addition into distilled water at 0 °C.
The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water
to neutral pH. Finally, the precipitate was dried at room temperature,
affording acetylated GL400. For 1H NMR measurements, 10
mg of the acetylated GL400 samples and 10 mg of PFA (internal standard)
were dissolved in 0.8 mL of DMSO-d6. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400N instrument
at a frequency of 400 MHz with an acquisition time of 4.0. All spectra
were recorded at 26 °C. Acetylation and 1H NMR measurements
were carried out five times.
