Superlattices are of great importance
due to their potential as
new materials genome to synthesize new functional materials. Thus,
tuning of the ground state of superlattices is crucial to further
control their physical properties. In this study, superlattices (SLs)
consisting of alternating layers of SrRuO3 (SRO) (5 nm)
and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 (LCMO) (5 nm)
are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates with 10-unit-cell periods. A variation in the substrate-induced-strain
for this choice of SLs triggers observation of remarkable properties,
such as magnetic anisotropy and large magnetic hysteresis. The strain
states experienced by LCMO and SRO in these SLs result in strong ferromagnetic
interlayer coupling and weak antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling
at low temperatures in SLs of LCMO–SRO/STO and a strong antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in SLs of LCMO–SRO/LAO. Besides, a large
magnetic hysteresis resulting from the predominant magnetic anisotropy
of SRO together with the strength of magnetic coupling is observed
in SLs of LCMO–SRO/LAO along the out-of-plane direction of
the LAO substrate. These four different magnetic behaviors along four
different directions of substrate orientations are interpreted in
terms of preferential orbital occupation and competing magnetic exchange
coupling together with magnetic anisotropy. This study demonstrates
the subtleties in controlling the strength of magnetic coupling at
the interface and stands as a model system to realize fascinating
magnetic phenomena in layer-by-layer hetero-epitaxial oxide films.

Introduction
Magnetic phenomena emerging from the interface
of oxide materials
never cease to astonish with their remarkable properties, when there
is a unique way of1,2 manipulating the interface.3,4 They are the key dictators of modern technological development.
To keep up the pace at which the progress in various areas is being
advanced, an increasing demand has to be handled by exploring5 and exploiting new possibilities in terms of
understanding the complexity of interfaces and materials for technology.
In this connection, producing exotic magnetic phenomena at the interface
using strain as one of the control parameters in self-assembled heterostructure
systems is a formidable task and when reasonably achieved, it is considered
to be an appreciable contribution to the science and technology. In
the process of accomplishing this, magnetic heterostructures fabricated
with the help of state-of-the-art techniques, creating sharp interfaces
with atomic precision, have been a topic of great interest and offer
an avenue to tune and tailor different magnetic interactions by the
choice of materials like manganites and ruthenates when they are put
in the form of bilayers,6,7 trilayers,8 heterostructures,9,10 and nanocomposites.11 The most attractive attributes commonly noticed
in different forms of material structures are the nature of magnetic
coupling and the strength of magnetic coupling at the interface. The
complexity of magnetic order, resulting from the above-mentioned factors,
mainly depends on the dominant energy of Zeeman, exchange coupling,
and anisotropy terms. Hence, how well we deal with the complexity
of magnetic order in a system matters a lot, in producing magnetic
properties of immense potential.

Persuaded by the luxury to
tune magnetic properties of complex
oxide heterostructures because of the significant interplay among
energy terms, in this work, we demonstrate an attempt to create diverse
magnetic behaviors in magnetic SLs without the aid of external stimuli
but by choosing a particular size of constituent layers of La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 (LCMO) and SrRuO3 (SRO), and substrates SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO). The charge ordering in LCMO can be destabilized when it is
in the form of thin films, and in the process of destabilizing the
charge ordered state, we anticipate that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
phases will be present. This would be of help to produce remarkable
properties when combined with SRO. The selection of substrates is
made in such a way that SRO experiences strain in both the cases,
whereas LCMO undergoes strain in only one case (on STO). It is further
identified that fabrication of sublayers with increasing thickness
is possible for STO; however, it is not quite easy for LAO because
the lattice mismatch between SRO and LAO is very large. Hence, we
preferred the thickness of the sublayers to be below the critical
thickness for SRO grown on a LAO substrate (5 nm), so as to maintain
the surface/interface smoothness. With this approach, we find that
it is possible to control the competing energies, in particular, exchange
coupling and magnetic anisotropy, and create complementary magnetic
behaviors (soft and hard) in these SLs as a function of substrate
orientation. This study throws light on the diversity of creating
dominant ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic couplings and soft or hard
magnetic behaviors in magnetic SLs.

Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) for SLs epitaxially grown on STO and
LAO along the surface direction is shown in Figure 1a. Both samples have high quality and a periodic
modulation of the two constituent phases that can be clearly identified
by the presence of regularly distributed high-order satellite peaks
around the main peak (zeroth order) of SLs. The presence of well-aligned
(00l) diffraction peaks of the SLs gives the orientation
relationship between SLs and the substrates, STO and LAO: SRO[001]//LCMO[001]//STO[001];
SRO[001]//LCMO[001]//LAO[001], demonstrating good epitaxy with c-axis orientation between SLs and the substrate. Moreover,
the homologous modulation length (Λ = asub/ΔL) of SLs grown on LAO and STO
is estimated to be around 10 nm in conformity with the originally
designed thickness.5 ΔL is the interval between two neighboring thickness fringes. Because L is the reciprocal lattice normalized by the substrate
lattice, the length or thickness in real space can be determined by
the inverse of the spacing (ΔL) between two
neighboring interference peaks multiplied by the substrate lattice
constant. The concept is widely used in many diffraction techniques,
such as XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), etc.

Figure 1 (a) Out-of-plane
(OOP) XRD profiles of LCMO–SRO SLs epitaxially
grown on STO(001) and LAO(001) were recorded and represented by red
and blue curves, respectively. The Bragg reflections of substrates
as well as the satellite peaks of the superlattice are indicated.
(b) Low-magnification diffraction-contrast cross-sectional TEM image
of the SLs grown on STO and LAO substrates; alternating bright and
dark layers are SRO and LCMO layers, respectively. (c, d) Selected
area EDPs of the SLs epitaxially grown on LAO and STO in the cross-section
sample along the [100] zone axis, respectively.

Relevant information concerning the heterointerface structure
of
the superlattice and its epitaxial relationship can be obtained from
TEM analysis. The low-magnification images of the films grown on LAO
(left) and STO (right), shown in Figure 1b, exhibit sharp, flat, and well-defined
interfaces between alternate SRO (bright contrast) and LCMO (dark
contrast) layers. Both superlattices are periodically stacked on different
substrates with an individual periodic sublayer thickness of ∼10
nm in both systems, which is in good agreement with the above XRD
results. Considering the lattice matching degree, the LCMO layer is
deposited first, and then the SRO layer on the LAO substrate, whereas
SRO is deposited first, and LCMO later on the STO substrate. Thus,
the inverse contrast of the initially deposited sublayer is observed
in different substrates. The corresponding electron diffraction pattern
(Figure 1c,d) confirms
the c-axis orientation of the films and the orientation
relationships are determined: (001)SRO∥(001)LCMO∥(001)LAO/STO; [100]SRO∥[100]LCMO∥[100]LAO/STO.

Figure 2 gives the
high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HADDF-STEM) image of the LCMO–SRO SLs taken using a JEM-ARM200F
TEM incorporated with a STEMCs corrector, revealing the bonding characteristic
of the heterointerface structure. The HADDF-STEM image demonstrates
an atomic number Z contrast that is roughly proportional
to the square of the atomic number Z (Z2).12 It is, thereby, believed
that different intensities can represent different atomic columns
directly. Thus, it is easy to conclude that the brighter and darker
dots represent La/Ca (57/20) and Mn(25) columns, respectively, in
the LCMO layer, the bright and dark dots represent Ru(44) and Sr(38)
columns, respectively, in the SRO layers (Figure 2a). The line scan profiles including all
typical atoms across the interface between SRO and LCMO layers were
performed, and the results are given in Figure 2b, as indicated by the yellow and purple
lines in Figure 2a.
It is largely terminated with the BO2 plane of each layer
along the growth direction in these SLs grown on STO and LAO.

Intensity scan along the yellow and purple lines as indicated in (a).

Through the high-precision statistics
and calculation on the two-dimensional
atomic coordinates with the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, the
in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane lattice parameters of the SLs grown
on STO and LAO substrates displayed as a function of the distance
away from the substrates along the c-axis are given
in Figure 3. Every
data point was obtained by averaging the measured in-plane and out-of-plane
values for each row of the individual unit cells parallel to the interface. Figure 3a,b shows the measured
values for SRO and LCMO (shadow area) grown on STO substrates along
the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. The in-plane
lattice parameters of the superlattice are approximately equal to
the bulk value of the STO substrate with a = 0.3905
nm (Figure 3a), suggesting
the strong constraint effect of the substrate in the thin film system.
Along the out-of-plane direction, the measured value of SRO is larger,
whereas it is smaller for LCMO compared with theoretical bulk parameters.

Figure 3 (a) and
(b) are the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters
of the superlattice near the STO substrate, respectively, that are
displayed as a function of the distance along the c-axis of the substrate. (c) and (d) are the in-plane and out-of-plane
lattice parameters of the superlattice near the LAO substrate, respectively,
that are displayed as a function of the distance along the c-axis of the substrate. (e) and (f) are the stress distribution
of the SLs grown on STO and LAO, respectively, in the two-dimensional
space.

Hence, it is observed that SRO
undergoes in-plane compressive strain
and out-of-plane tensile strain; meanwhile, LCMO has an in-plane tensile
strain and is almost strain free in SLs grown on the STO substrate,
from our analysis of the lattice parameters. On the other hand, the
strain state of the superlattice grown on the LAO substrate is also
investigated in the same way. Surprisingly, sensitive lattice variations
are detected only at the first period of the superlattice. As presented
in Figure 3c, in-plane
parameters of both LCMO and SRO are smaller than those of bulk values
at the first period due to the constraint of the LAO substrate (a = 3.79 Å). After the first unit cell, the lattice
parameter of LCMO is relaxed and gets very close to the bulk lattice
parameter (a = 3.86 Å). Similarly, SRO is also
subjected to a compressive stress followed by the increase in parameters
due to its own large bulk values in the first period. Then, the lattice
parameters of LCMO and SRO have a stable value after the first period
till the end of the stacking and are shown in Figure 3d. The values of pseudocubic lattice parameters
of SRO and LCMO on STO and LAO substrates are listed in Table 1. The strain states experienced
by SRO and LCMO on STO and LAO substrates are clearly depicted with
the help of arrows in Figure 3e,f, respectively.

Magnetization
as a function of temperature for the SLs grown on
STO and LAO substrates, in the temperature ranges 300–10 and
380–10 K, respectively, measured along the in-plane (IP) and
out-of-plane (OOP) directions during cooling and heating cycles under
a magnetic field of 100 Oe, is plotted in the top panel of Figure 4. LCMO is known to
have an atomic force microscopy (AFM) ordering in the bulk but in
thin films, an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition is observed
with increasing thickness of the LCMO layer.13 SRO is known to have its TC around 150
K in the thin film14 form. It is worth
noting that the magnetization behaviors of SLs are completely different
in all four crystallographic orientations, namely, along the STO[100]
direction (IP-STO), STO[001] direction (OOP-STO), LAO[100] direction
(IP-LAO), and LAO[001] direction (OOP-LAO). Along IP-STO, we identify
that the Curie temperatures of SRO (∼110 K) and LCMO (∼150
K) are shifted to low temperatures, and these values of Curie temperature
are consistent with those of SRO and LCMO single layers on STO (shown
in the inset). A peak in magnetization appears around 145 K, for SLs
grown on LAO along IP-LAO, indicative of antiferromagnetic coupling.
It can be understood, as the LCMO layers order ferromagnetically first
and SRO layers start to order ferromagnetically at low temperatures,
with their orientation being antiparallel to those of LCMO layers,
when the SLs are cooled under an external magnetic field. Such a peak
in magnetization is not seen along any other crystallographic orientation,
and hence, the antiferromagnetic coupling strength seems to be the
strongest for SLs on the LAO substrate. A better understanding of
the magnetic interactions between SRO and LCMO layers on STO and LAO
substrates is possible from field-dependent magnetization behavior.

Magnetization as a function of
the magnetic field, M(H), has been
recorded, and the M(H) curves along
the out-of-plane orientation of
SLs grown on STO and LAO in the temperature range 100–10 K
are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4. Here, the competition between Zeeman energy
and energy of AF coupling is expected to play an important role, i.e.,
at high magnetic fields, Zeeman energy is predominant, and at low
magnetic fields, the energy of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling
exceeds the Zeeman energy. The competition between these two energies
has been reflected in the M(H) curves
for IP-LAO and, on the other hand, there is no signature of AF coupling
in the case of IP-STO (not shown here), as the same can be observed
from the M(T) curves. Remarkably, M(H) behaviors along OOP-STO and OOP-LAO
are striking in terms of AF coupling and magnetic hysteresis, respectively. M(H) for OOP-STO shows hard axis behavior
and magnetization switching behavior. The switching is an obvious
sign of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling between the two component
layers. The shape of the step in the M(H) loop is understood based on the magnetic moments of the layers.
As LCMO has a higher magnetic moment compared to SRO, it saturates
first and the second step is contributed by SRO. The coercive field
measured from M(H) loops attains
the highest value of ∼ 800 Oe around 50 K. The OOP-LAO magnetic
loops show large magnetic coercive fields due to strong magnetic anisotropy
of SRO layers that shows up at low temperatures. The magnitude of
the hysteresis loop at 10 K is as large as 4 T, which is much larger
than that of the SRO component layer. This kind of hysteresis is rarely
observed in manganite–ruthenite magnetic SLs. Besides, magnetization
switching behavior is present similar to that in the OOP-STO configuration
but only observed at low temperatures. The complexity of magnetic
order is mainly governed by the magnetic competition among AF interlayer
coupling, magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman effect.

To detect
the contrasting magnetization behaviors of the SLs on
STO and LAO substrates, we employed two complementary and powerful15 techniques, X-ray linear dichroism (XLD) and
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The Mn dichroism spectra
for LCMO–SRO/STO and LCMO–SRO/LAO superlattices, obtained
as the difference between the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
data taken with the helicity parallel and antiparallel to the applied
magnetic field (E//ab and E//c), in the temperature ranges 300–50
and 200–50 K, respectively, are shown in the top panel of Figure 5. The two major contributions
to Mn dichroism spectra are magnetic and orbital occupation. At temperatures
below the magnetic transition temperature, a strong magnetic contribution
to Mn dichroism spectra is expected, whereas above the magnetic transition
temperatures, the only contribution to dichroism spectra comes from
the preferential orbital occupation. There is no considerable change
in the intensities of these dichroism spectra for SLs grown on STO
above 150 K. The changes in the intensity and shape of the spectra
are clearly observed at temperatures close to 50 K. We understand
that with decreasing temperature, the AFM phase starts to appear at
temperatures below 100 K, and this appearance and change in the AFM
phase are also depicted in the magnetic phase transitions observed
from temperature- and field-dependent magnetization curves. On the
other hand, the observed change is rather significant, particularly
between the temperatures 100 and 50 K, in the case of SLs grown on
LAO. This considerable change in the intensity of dichroism spectra
is attributed to the presence of a larger antiferromagnetic phase
in SLs grown on LAO compared to those grown on STO. We see that the
temperature range over which the AFM phase evolves closely matches
with the temperate range over which the phase transitions are observed
in M(T) behavior. The magnetic phases
here are driven by strain-induced structural deformation and can be
addressed in terms of preferential orbital occupation among Mn and
Ru ions16 at the interface, as orbital
hybridization and strain-dependent orbital occupation have key roles
to play in deciding the interfacial magnetic coupling. The observed
difference in the shape of these dichroism spectra with temperature
hints that the orientation of the local magnetic moment of the corresponding
dominant magnetic phase changes with temperature and further contributes
to magnetic anisotropy. The lower panel of Figure 5 depicts the XMCD spectra for LCMO–SRO/STO
SLs and LCMO–SRO/LAO SLs recorded at 80 K. The larger signal
in SLs grown on LAO compared to that in SLs grown on STO shows that
spin orientation depends on the substrate. Importantly, the magnetic
hysteresis in this case is remarkably large.

K, respectively. (bottom panel) MnL2,3-edge XMCD of LCMO–SRO superlattice samples recorded at 80
K grown on STO and LAO.

It is well known that structural deformation determines the
stabilization
of either in-plane eg(x2 – y2) or out-of-plane eg(3z2 – r2) orbital order.17 In the present case, the XLD spectra provide
an understanding of the preferred orbital occupation in the SLs grown
on STO and LAO that the expansion of the in-plane lattice parameter
of LCMO in LCMO–SRO/STO SLs results in a decrease in the Mn–O
bond length and the preferential occupation would be a mixture of
the IP x2 – y2 orbital and OOP (3z2 – r2) orbital. On the other hand, a slight expansion
of the out-of-plane lattice parameter of LCMO in LCMO–SRO/LAO
SLs and a probable increase in the Mn–O bond length favor occupation
of the IP x2 – y2 orbital.

It is important to note here that, in
accordance with Goodenough–Kanamori
rules, the empty eg orbitals in Ru of SRO can ferromagnetically
couple with partially filled eg orbitals of Mn3+ but antiferromagnetically couple with Mn4+ of LCMO at
the interface, as there are no eg electrons available in
Mn4+. In LCMO, even though equal number of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are available, the same may not reflect
in the availability of partially filled or empty eg orbitals,
mainly because of the fact that orbital filling depends on the amount
of strain experienced by LCMO and SRO at the interface. This strain
mainly controls the relative energies of the t2g orbitals
of Mn and Ru. Under these conditions, an eg electron of
Ru easily hops between Ru and Mn ions in SLs grown on STO, as the
energy difference associated with the transfer process is small, giving
rise to dominant FM coupling, whereas this energy difference must
be larger for SLs grown on LAO, resulting in AF coupling. Besides,
we see two contributions to magnetic anisotropy, one comes from the
reduced symmetry at the interface, resulting from the modification
of surface energy, and the second comes from the distortion of the
lattice because of the strain between magnetic layers, resulting from
the modification of volume energy. SRO is known for its large magnetic
anisotropy18 depending on the strain it
undergoes. In the current study, LCMO and SRO play crucial roles of
tuning the strength of the magnetic coupling (FM and AF) at the interface
and the competition between magnetic coupling and magnetic anisotropy
in producing a large magnetic hysteresis by merely changing the orientation
and the substrate.

Conclusions
To summarize, SLs of
LCMO–SRO/STO and LCMO–SRO/LAO
show diverse magnetic properties along different orientations of the
substrates. These remarkable properties are mainly attributed to the
competition between magnetic coupling and magnetic anisotropy at the
interface, resulting from the substrate-induced strain states experienced
by the constituent magnetic layers. SLs of LCMO–SRO exhibit
mainly FM interlayer coupling on STO substrates and AFM coupling on
LAO substrates. A large magnetic hysteresis, resulting from the predominant
magnetic anisotropy of SRO together with magnetic coupling, is observed
in SLs of LCMO–SRO/LAO along the OOP direction of LAO substrates.
The strain states experienced by LCMO and SRO in SLs contribute to
strong AF coupling as a consequence of preferential orbital occupation,
and on the other hand, the magnetic anisotropy of SRO is enhanced
to give rise to a large magnetic hysteresis along the OOP direction.
This study makes a profound impact in the field of magnetic heterostructures
by providing the freedom to select between complementary magnetic
behaviors in the same SLs.

Experimental Details
Sample Fabrication
The LCMO–SRO superlattices
were fabricated artificially on single-crystalline (001)-oriented
STO and LAO substrates by pulsed-laser deposition. Single-terminated
and atomically flat surfaces of STO and LAO are obtained by a typical
chemical treatment and an annealing process19 and only high-temperature annealing,20 respectively. The growth process was carried out at 700 °C
under an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr. Ten-period layers were
grown with the alternation of 5 nm-thick SRO and 5 nm-thick LCMO.
The accurate thickness of SLs together with a layer-by-layer growth
mode was monitored in situ by reflection high-energy electron diffraction.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The lattice structures
of the high-quality LCMO–SRO SLs were successfully evidenced
and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HR-STEM) experiments were carried on a JEM-ARM200, which
was operated at 200 keV with a cold field-emission electron gun having
a resolution of 0.078 nm. The HRTEM investigations were performed
in a TITAN 80-300 FEI microscope with a spherical aberration-corrected
probe-forming system. The cross-section specimens suitable for TEM
observations were prepared via a standard procedure followed by the
mechanical grinding, polishing and ion beam milling processes.

Magnetic
Measurements and Analysis
To determine the
magnetic ordering and the magnetic coupling between SRO and LCMO layers,
a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) Superconducting
Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer was employed.

X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy
Element-specific X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic linear and circular
dichroism (XMCD and XMLD) measurements were performed at L-edges of Mn to carefully study the electronic and spin states of
Mn ions in these heterostructures. The XMCD and XMLD spectra were
recorded in total electron yield mode at the Dragon beamline at the
National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan.
